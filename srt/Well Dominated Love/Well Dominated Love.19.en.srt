1
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,890
You're kinda different today

2
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:00,890
Really?

3
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,060
What's different?

4
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,010
You asked me out to have a meal

5
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,660
You're just cutting the chips but don't eat them

6
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:09,510
And you leave your favorite shrimps untouched

7
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,390
Well do you see

8
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,740
other differences?

9
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:19,240
Yes! Yes!

10
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,090
The so-called Dry Maple Color really works

11
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,890
Are you wearing lipsticks?

12
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,160
Does it work?

13
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,390
The lanolin in lipsticks

14
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,810
has very strong adsorption

15
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,210
which will attract dust and bacteria in the air

16
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,690
and other hazardous substance

17
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:37,040
to your lip mucosa

18
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,290
Then those substance will

19
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:42,490
get into your body through your oral cavity

20
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,690
while you're eating

21
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,340
So I suggest you'd better

22
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,360
wipe it off while eating

23
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:51,810
I was afraid I would ruin my makeup

24
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:54,190
I didn't try my favorite shrimps

25
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,790
It turns out that you didn't tell the differences at all

26
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,860
Stop doing that

27
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,460
It's lovely

28
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,790
That's not what you said

29
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:07,490
It's not a big deal

30
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,790
if you just apply it several times

31
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,940
You peeled shrimps for me!

32
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,690
It's a sort of fans bonus

33
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:19,990
Thank you

34
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:23,610
But I don't to be your fan anymore

35
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,290
What?

36
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:31,290
I'm saying since it is the bonus for fans

37
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,040
I'll eat more

38
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,590
Okay

39
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,490
May I be excused for a minute?

40
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:42,390
I'll eat them when I'm back

41
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,410
What took you so long?

42
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,260
Are you okay?

43
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,710
I made a cake

44
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,240
What day is it today?

45
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,210
Guess!

46
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,460
Hold on! Let me answer a phone call

47
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,210
Hey, Xiaoqiao

48
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,210
What's wrong?

49
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:20,210
Calm down

50
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:20,960
Take you time

51
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,290
Okay

52
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,610
Text me the address

53
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:25,510
I'll be right there

54
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,060
Sorry

55
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,060
I gotta go

56
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,410
Where are you going?

57
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:32,910
Xiaoqiao was scratched by an E-bike

58
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:34,090
I gotta send her to the hospital

59
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,160
It's faster for her to get to the hospital herself

60
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,710
Also, you're a brain doctor

61
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:40,140
not a surgeon

62
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,490
I'm a doctor

63
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,660
and I'm her friend at the same time

64
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:44,190
Sorry

65
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,540
I can't send you home today

66
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,690
Let me know when you get home

67
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,340
But I...

68
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,740
I'll be with you

69
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,610
You are here

70
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,990
Sorry to

71
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,590
interrupt your date

72
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,240
Never mind

73
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,590
You're always getting into troubles

74
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:19,190
I'm used to it

75
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:21,860
Is everything alright?

76
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,690
Nothing special

77
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,890
It's just something wrong with one of my legs

78
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,240
I can't move it

79
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,310
Not a big deal

80
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:33,490
It didn't hurt the bone

81
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,140
Let me send you to the hospital

82
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:36,490
Can you use another leg?

83
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,510
Dr. Han

84
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,610
You wanna see me hop

85
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,760
with high heels

86
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:43,740
OK, I'll hold you

87
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:45,790
How about I carry you on my back?

88
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:47,490
I can feel my strength

89
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,260
Don't screw it up

90
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,160
It's easy for her to suffer second damage

91
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,310
if she gets bumped

92
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:16,340
Tong Xin

93
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:17,440
Get on

94
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,040
Send her to the hospital

95
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:22,110
I'll go home by myself

96
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,860
Let me know when you're home

97
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,210
I'm telling you

98
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:33,310
I'm gonna go on a blind date

99
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,560
I just wanna let you know

100
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:39,010
It's said he is a senior Engineer of Internet

101
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,690
So we've made an appointment

102
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,210
We'll see each other the day after tomorrow

103
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:45,910
I wanna go to see him first

104
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:47,460
If I feel good,

105
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,910
we can go further

106
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,890
I just wanna tell you

107
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,410
you gotta be responsible for

108
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:03,710
the negotiations tomorrow

109
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,860
and the signing of contract the day after tomorrow

110
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:05,860
Come on

111
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,040
It's the middle of the night

112
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,580
It's not a good time for work

113
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,110
And give me a reason

114
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:12,990
I'll leaving for Jinghai

115
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,860
It's tomorrow's business

116
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,260
Why are you telling me now?

117
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:19,440
I have no idea now

118
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,840
Mr. Yan

119
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,540
Yan

120
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,210
Jingzhi

121
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,060
My dear Zhi

122
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,290
What are you doing?

123
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,610
You're falling in love,

124
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,410
but why am I bearing your cross?

125
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:49,310
Give me my phone, okay?

126
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,140
You've gone too far!

127
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:08,210
I like to stay at home

128
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:09,210
to learn how to cook,

129
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,190
to watch movies,

130
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:10,990
and to read books, or something like this

131
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:11,740
So do I

132
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,790
I'm usually busy

133
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:16,040
so I wanna relax myself when I'm free

134
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,540
So what kind of girlfriend do you want?

135
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,840
1.65 meters tall at least

136
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:25,860
Relatively beautiful

137
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,290
A nice personality really matters

138
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,740
With a stable job

139
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,210
So basically those are what I want

140
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:32,560
I think I can meet your standards

141
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,410
No, no, no

142
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,040
You've been far beyond those standards

143
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:39,340
Do you have any requirements for your future boyfriend, Miss Nie?

144
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:45,360
I just want him to remember I'm his beloved one

145
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:46,860
That's enough

146
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,060
I have a really good memory

147
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,610
You can test me if possible

148
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,740
Okay

149
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,590
Would you mind my joining?

150
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,410
Who are you?

151
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:57,160
It doesn't matter

152
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,560
I heard your conversation just now

153
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,260
I have some question to ask you

154
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:01,960
Eh...

155
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,360
Are you OK with your girlfriend

156
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,040
who is always with her male boss

157
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,440
and takes care of the boss's diet and daily life?

158
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,060
It's not convenient, is it?

159
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,590
Okay

160
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:11,060
Are you OK with your girlfriend

161
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,210
on call day and night,

162
00:10:12,210 --> 00:10:13,690
waiting for the boss's assignment?

163
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,360
I'd like to support women's work

164
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,990
But I still think the workplace and personal life

165
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,260
should be kept separate

166
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:19,990
Good for you

167
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:21,490
Are you OK with your girlfriend

168
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,860
deeply loving

169
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,890
a man with far better abilities in all aspects

170
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:25,240
than you?

171
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:26,740
I can't accept it

172
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,810
Very good!

173
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:28,790
Do you hear that?

174
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,860
You're not the one for him

175
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,090
Standards can vary from person to person

176
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,040
Hold on!

177
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,710
You was mentioning Miss Nie just now?

178
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:37,510
That's right

179
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:39,490
You know each other?

180
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,540
I forgot introducing myself

181
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,940
I'm the male boss

182
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,440
I mentioned before

183
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,610
Now the world is really quiet

184
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,510
Get out of my way!

185
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,410
What are you doing?

186
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,460
I've planned some other activities

187
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:03,910
for today's blind date

188
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:04,840
But now,

189
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,940
thank to you,

190
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,340
I can just do those things on my own

191
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,710
I'll send you there

192
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,440
At this time,

193
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,110
you should be in your business trip in Beijing, am I right?

194
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,610
I'm back to solve something urgent in the company

195
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,060
Well, just go to the company

196
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,760
Why did you come to mess up my blind date?

197
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:46,410
I just bumped into you and your date who is unsatisfying

198
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,010
Why are you unsatisfied with

199
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,760
my date?

200
00:11:50,010 --> 00:11:51,290
You are my

201
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:52,840
Chief Secretary

202
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,310
So you should have a good taste about your boyfriend

203
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,990
That plaid shirt isn't right for you

204
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,160
What plaid shirt?

205
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,060
He's called Zekai

206
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,860
What a good name!

207
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,440
But reasonably,

208
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,910
he's really not

209
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,990
a good boyfriend choice

210
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,760
But I wanna find a man for marriage

211
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:15,160
Without doubt,

212
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,560
he'll be a good husband

213
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,540
Are you out of your mind?

214
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:20,690
Be careful

215
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:22,940
Look

216
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:25,060
He has a good temper,

217
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,510
so we can have a smooth conversation

218
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,190
about daily life chores

219
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:29,440
As for his job,

220
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,260
he just needs to deal with

221
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:32,510
computers and codes

222
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,260
He has few single female colleagues,

223
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,610
so he'll barely have an affair

224
00:12:36,210 --> 00:12:37,040
The most important thing is

225
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,310
my mom also likes him

226
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:39,940
Your mom likes him

227
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,840
Well how about you?

228
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,160
Can you live with a man without any taste and

229
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,510
sharing no common language with you

230
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:45,340
for a whole life?

231
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,560
I'd like to do so,

232
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:47,740
only if he can remember to love me

233
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,790
Yan Jingzhi

234
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,590
Are you jealous?

235
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,510
No

236
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,060
If so, why did you sneering?

237
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,310
None of your business

238
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,740
Concentrate on driving!

239
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:04,290
I'm driving carefully!

240
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,590
I don't know where to go

241
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,810
How about I make a U-turn

242
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,660
to let you see your Zekai?

243
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:15,110
Turn right ahead

244
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:16,010
No

245
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:48,440
Please enjoy it

246
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,840
Since we're here

247
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,260
Why not have a chat?

248
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,360
Do you remember this restaurant?

249
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:10,960
No

250
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,340
Five years ago,

251
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,290
you proposed to me

252
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,390
at this seat

253
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,510
in this restaurant

254
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,440
For you,

255
00:14:27,690 --> 00:14:28,710
it's a beautiful memory

256
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,410
But for me, it's totally strange

257
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,940
Everything we experienced together

258
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,810
has become your torments

259
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,660
Before, you usually told stories to me

260
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:45,490
Today, I'd like to tell you a story

261
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,660
In Roman Mythology,

262
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,590
Venus is the embodiment of love and beauty

263
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:58,340
The Romans called her Venus

264
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:01,490
She ever fell in love with

265
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,960
a handsome hunter

266
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,190
She was afraid the hunter would meet danger,

267
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,460
so she persuaded him into

268
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,260
avoiding hunting those brutal beasts

269
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,760
But he turned a deaf ear to Venus' words

270
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:15,240
So irritated, she left him,

271
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,340
flying to her residence

272
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,560
After a while,

273
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,360
the hunter was hit to death

274
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:24,290
by a wild pig one day

275
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:28,460
Venus heard her lover's groan in the half sky,

276
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,010
so she flew to the ground,

277
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,760
only to saw the hunter's body covered with blood

278
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,040
What she regretted most at that moment

279
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:42,010
was she wasn't with him

280
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,190
Even so,

281
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,560
she can't change the hunter's nature

282
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,510
and all roads lead to Rome

283
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:56,840
But how can you know the end if

284
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,740
you don't have a try?

285
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,590
I think you didn't think it clearly

286
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,290
Let's talk another day

287
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,390
I've considered it clearly

288
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,360
So I bring you here

289
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,660
I just wanna start over

290
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,010
at the place where we were over

291
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,790
Yan Jingzhi

292
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:23,440
Whether you can remember me or not,

293
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,610
I'll be with you all the time

294
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,340
to face everything

295
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,840
Will you give me this chance?

296
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,960
Even though we get together today,

297
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,240
I'll forget you tomorrow

298
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,810
I don't want to waste your time and affection

299
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,890
Do you know what I regret most?

300
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,010
That is I left you

301
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:55,340
considering myself always right at the beginning

302
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,160
I thought

303
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,860
we can start a new life respectively

304
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,590
But it proves that

305
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,310
we both can't make it

306
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:10,090
In this case,

307
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,490
let's go back to the beginning

308
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:14,390
and just follow our heart

309
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:16,840
No matter what will happen in the future,

310
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,060
I wanna be with you

311
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:20,740
OK?

312
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,040
You'll be sorry

313
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,510
Maybe

314
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,910
But I won't abandon the happiness at sight

315
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,740
for the unknown things

316
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,110
I'm asking you for the last time

317
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,710
Have you decided yet?

318
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:04,790
Morning

319
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,690
Morning, Xingchen

320
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,210
Why is Tong Xin late today?

321
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,740
Oh, Tong Xin

322
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,860
called in sick

323
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:14,710
Alas,

324
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,560
I've told her many times but she just ignored my words

325
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,840
Day and night,

326
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,740
she's just playing her computer,

327
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:19,660
spending time on her cell phone,

328
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,310
and ordering take-out,

329
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,610
without doing any exercise

330
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,110
How could she be in a good health?

331
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:31,410
Are you alright?

332
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:41,160
I'm OK. I'm full of energy after a rest

333
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,460
Mr. Yan

334
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,740
It's the case planning for the fifth anniversary of the mall

335
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:52,760
Please check it

336
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,090
You can just put it here

337
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:56,660
By the way

338
00:18:56,810 --> 00:18:58,140
I've cancelled this weekend's plan

339
00:18:58,140 --> 00:18:59,690
Would you like to do extra work

340
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:00,990
or have a rest?

341
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:01,910
What will you do?

342
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:03,990
I want

343
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,440
to date with my boyfriend

344
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,290
OK

345
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,460
You have the final say, Miss Nie

346
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,590
You're so nice, Mr. Yan

347
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,560
Only be nice to you

348
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,140
I'm also very satisfied in the end

349
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,040
Come here

350
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,640
Hold on

351
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:21,940
You are my boss or my boyfriend now?

352
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:23,840
Boyfriend

353
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,240
Alright, I won't go

354
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:26,560
Why?

355
00:19:28,090 --> 00:19:30,140
My boss is really serious

356
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,290
and he said we can't have our work influenced by personal matters

357
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,610
Secretary Nie

358
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,660
Come here

359
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,760
What can I do for you?

360
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:43,190
My chest aches

361
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,140
Can you give me a rub

362
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,890
Yan Jingzhi

363
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,010
We're in the company now

364
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,490
Can you be serious?

365
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,450
If everybody in the company knows

366
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,790
you're my girlfriend

367
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,090
and I forget you then,

368
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,340
you'll feel much more guaranteed

369
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,660
It's so low

370
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,110
to keep up appearance by gossip

371
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:00,660
I've come up with a more practical idea

372
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,940
Tell me about it!

373
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:06,290
I'm done with it

374
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,510
You're flirting with me

375
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,260
You're naughty

376
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,990
Why are you standing here?

377
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:35,060
Come in

378
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,040
Hey

379
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:40,320
I've long given you my invitation

380
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,590
You just offer me the Chuan Chuan Xiang

381
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,240
I made a block booking

382
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,210
It deserves your name

383
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,960
I see, it shows that I'm in an important place

384
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,660
in your heart

385
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,440
What do you want to have?

386
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:55,060
Suit yourself

387
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:56,560
OK

388
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:13,790
Did you ever eat it?

389
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,060
Of course

390
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,810
I ate it with the company staff every day

391
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:17,310
when I started my own business

392
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,710
But at that time,

393
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,660
we only ordered noodles and vegetables

394
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,560
Meat, meatballs or something like this

395
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,590
are luxury for us

396
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,810
Today I'll enjoy myself

397
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,310
Today

398
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,260
I'll let you go when you're satisfied enough

399
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:29,860
I can keep eating till you have no money in your pocket

400
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:30,790
Be my guest

401
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:43,910
What do you want to drink?

402
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:44,340
I'll go to get it for you

403
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,190
Stay

404
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,660
It's men's duty

405
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:47,560
What?

406
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,160
Coke

407
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,010
OK

408
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,640
Coke at ordinary temperature

409
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,660
Are you enchanted by me?

410
00:22:27,710 --> 00:22:28,960
Nah

411
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,640
The flavor is still the same as that when I was at school

412
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,790
It hasn't changed at all

413
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,740
You never ate it any more after graduation?

414
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,910
I should control my diet when I'm an artist

415
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,140
And

416
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,060
my agent always keeps an eye on me,

417
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,990
stopping me from eating it

418
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,410
Later when I realized it would make me fat in the camera

419
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,610
I never tried it again

420
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,160
So like you,

421
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,210
it's also luxury for me

422
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,310
Alright

423
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,310
We should eat up!

424
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,290
Mr. Yan Jingzhi,

425
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,760
what are you doing now?

426
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,310
Do you need any extra help?

427
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,990
Not now

428
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,360
Are you shooting video?

429
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:03,660
Yeah

430
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,210
It's the practical method you mentioned

431
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,890
We can make some vlogs

432
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,190
If you forget me again one day,

433
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:14,960
these videos can tell you

434
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,510
we were together ever

435
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,260
I hope it will never come in handy

436
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:20,590
Well, then we can keep it as a souvenir

437
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,910
It'll be the heirloom of our family

438
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:23,290
Come on, smile

439
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,590
A close-up

440
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:28,490
Film my profile

441
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,640
It's much more handsome

442
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,610
You're showing off

443
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:32,940
Here

444
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,640
Give me a close-up

445
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,910
How could you dictate me?

446
00:24:38,390 --> 00:24:39,260
Mind your own business

447
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,890
Lean against your boyfriend

448
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:30,240
Don't bother

449
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,990
I've sited for so long time

450
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,540
I gotta do some exercise

451
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:50,790
What's wrong, Jingzhi?

452
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,140
Does your blood phobia break out?

453
00:25:57,610 --> 00:25:58,460
No

454
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,860
I just had a headache suddenly

455
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,510
Let's stop here

456
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,540
Get in and have a rest

457
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,760
Be with me

458
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,310
I...

459
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,960
I have to make video call with my mom every night

460
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,910
Now it's almost the time

461
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:23,910
I gotta go

462
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,810
Good night

463
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,610
Good night

464
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,260
Cool!

465
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,410
Full but cool

466
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,040
I'm too full to breathe

467
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,710
Will I gain weight?

468
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,960
I ate too much

469
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,240
No

470
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,760
It's OK if you exercise more

471
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,260
It's near your old school, right?

472
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:18,790
Go!

473
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:19,540
Let's stroll

474
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,540
How about another day?

475
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,840
We'll be in trouble if someone recognizes me

476
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,740
No

477
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,860
Just today

478
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,860
It will cause us many troubles

479
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,060
Hello, do you wanna make a block booking?

480
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,390
Zhen Nian

481
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:32,290
Sorry,

482
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:32,990
you have the wrong person

483
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:33,840
I'm your fan

484
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,610
I can't have the wrong person

485
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,540
You're Zhen Nian

486
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:37,940
Please take a picture with me

487
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,190
Be quiet, everybody

488
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:41,340
Look,

489
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,560
since we meet today,

490
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,260
how about taking a picture together?

491
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,140
Okay

492
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:48,140
People in the back row, take out your phones

493
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,260
Yes

494
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,310
Squat lower

495
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,360
People in the front, squat lower

496
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,260
Ready!

497
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:54,490
Three, two, one

498
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,710
Run!

499
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:02,990
Hurry up!

500
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,260
This way, this way

501
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,390
Slow down, slow down

502
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:08,040
Oh no, my leg

503
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,740
It hurts

504
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:14,110
I realized

505
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,610
we should not only be armed to the teeth,

506
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,660
but also wear sneakers

507
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,610
It hurts

508
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,540
Of course

509
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,610
What are you doing?

510
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,040
Wear my shoes

511
00:29:34,310 --> 00:29:35,460
Then what will you wear?

512
00:29:37,190 --> 00:29:38,540
Bare feet

513
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,410
Or I'll wear yours

514
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,310
Why are you frozen?

515
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,460
Go!

516
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,140
They're missing over there. I have no sight of them here

517
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,940
Did they run this way?

518
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:13,390
This way, let's go find them

519
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:09,810
Hi, aunt

520
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,710
You're so cool

521
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,710
Look, Jingzhi

522
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,110
Why do you have no reaction?

523
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,290
I'm used to it

524
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,610
Darling,

525
00:31:21,610 --> 00:31:23,060
thanks for picking me up

526
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,190
My pleasure, aunt

527
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:27,640
You lost some weight,

528
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,940
my baby boy

529
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:30,060
Ms. Ye

530
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:31,390
it's your usual open statement

531
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:33,090
You're really thin

532
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,210
Why didn't you tell me you didn't feel well?

533
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,960
Are you participating the

534
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,240
Halley Rally?

535
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,960
You're much more important

536
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:42,540
If Ziyu didn't tell me that,

537
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,260
I would never know you doesn't feel well

538
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,010
Aunt

539
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,810
It's not an organic problem,

540
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,760
so it won't influence his physical health

541
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,590
Really?

542
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,610
You may rest assured

543
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,110
Good

544
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,660
Aunt

545
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:58,510
Can you teach me

546
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,040
how to be cool like you another day?

547
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,810
Fabulous

548
00:32:02,010 --> 00:32:02,890
Really?

549
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:03,510
You like it?

550
00:32:03,510 --> 00:32:04,940
Of course

551
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,590
OK, I'll teach you another day

552
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:10,910
Have some fruits

553
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:15,810
Xingchen,

554
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:17,740
let's free our hearts when

555
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,990
Jingzhi isn't here

556
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:20,790
Okay

557
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,760
Since Ziyu told me

558
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,510
Jingzhi's illness,

559
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,710
as his mother,

560
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,990
I really wanna express my thanks to you for

561
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:32,090
your keeping being with my son

562
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,510
You don't blame me?

563
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:37,990
Without me,

564
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,440
he wouldn't lose his memory over and over again

565
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,390
How can I blame you?

566
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,290
Because of you,

567
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,290
Jingzhi knows how to love someone

568
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,110
rather than becoming a money machine

569
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,960
like his father

570
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,840
I should be to blame for his illness

571
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,260
I didn't do my duty

572
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,740
as a mother

573
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,740
Don't say that

574
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,940
I wanna ask you one question

575
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,560
What?

576
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,390
Did Jingzhi experience

577
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,810
something provoking

578
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,690
when he was in his childhood?

579
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,090
In his childhood?

580
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:16,740
He was quite good when he was young

581
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:17,590
I didn't...

582
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,940
One thing comes to my mind!

583
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,760
Did Jingzhi mention

584
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,660
his workaholic father?

585
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,410
Yes

586
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,260
At the beginning of our marriage,

587
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,360
we were close to each other

588
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:50,740
And we led a happy life

589
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,260
But later, his father's life

590
00:33:55,210 --> 00:33:56,610
was gradually occupied

591
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,110
by his work

592
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,810
I have fewer and fewer chance to see him

593
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,490
I always think

594
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,860
love is above all

595
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,960
I gave up my job for him

596
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:14,740
I was idle around at home every day

597
00:34:16,490 --> 00:34:17,560
In order to attract his attention,

598
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,560
I did do something stupid

599
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,010
during those years

600
00:34:33,390 --> 00:34:34,510
Never mind

601
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,640
It's been

602
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,910
so many years

603
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:44,310
Later our life was full

604
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,760
of arguments

605
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:51,260
So our affection withered up

606
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,490
Till the year when Jingzhi was 8 years old,

607
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:02,940
we got a big quarrel

608
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,940
I should be to blame for it

609
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,210
I was so impulse

610
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:18,240
Mom, mom

611
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,990
Wake up, mom

612
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:20,460
Jingzhi

613
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,660
Come back

614
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:22,840
Mom

615
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:23,510
Let's go

616
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,040
After my discharge from hospital,

617
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,690
I got divorced with Jingzhi's father

618
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,440
Jingzhi lived with his father

619
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,610
Since then,

620
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,660
Jingzhi seemed to forget

621
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,640
what happened that day

622
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,440
We never mentioned it

623
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,660
I never thought that

624
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,810
will influence Jingzhi

625
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,490
I read from books that

626
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:04,590
human brains can store the subconscious memory

627
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,310
and you can't realize how

628
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,110
much it can influence you

629
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,310
Does that thing have something to do

630
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,790
with his illness?

631
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,290
Mr. Yan,

632
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,360
do you often dream?

633
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:44,110
Can you recall anything special in your dreams?

634
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,340
I...

635
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,290
I often dreamed about some fragments

636
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:55,640
A...

637
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,760
A woman with bloody wrist

638
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,190
Bloody floor

639
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,540
It's just a nightmare

640
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,490
or something you did really see in real life?

641
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,910
I... I'm not sure

642
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:21,940
Xingchen,

643
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,660
It's been a long time

644
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,160
How is he doing now?

645
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:27,810
I think a long time is a good thing

646
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:29,540
It shows he's willing to cooperate with the doctor

647
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:30,610
Don't worry

648
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:31,540
We just wait and see

649
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,640
Your mom talked with me just now

650
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:40,240
I know that you've ever seen her

651
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:43,090
commit suicide when you're 8

652
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:45,060
That's exactly what you have in your dreams

653
00:37:45,790 --> 00:37:46,610
Could you tell me

654
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,610
why I lost

655
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,010
the memory about it?

656
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,860
If one experiences external stimulus,

657
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:56,840
he'd like to forget what he doesn't want to remember

658
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,460
or he'd like to avoid someone or something

659
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,560
Although you don't remember it,

660
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,260
but it still exerts great impacts on

661
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,660
you in your subconscious mind

662
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:06,690
So,

663
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,390
my amnesia is related to this memory?

664
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:11,810
So far, it is

665
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,960
Because you grew up watching your parents

666
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,710
fight like Kilkenny cats for love,

667
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:19,740
in your subconscious mind,

668
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,310
you desire love,

669
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:23,160
but you're afraid of being hurt by it

670
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,490
I see you mean

671
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,040
I'm afraid of being hurt,

672
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:30,990
so I chose to forget it

673
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,160
From the perspective of psychology, that's true

674
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:35,790
It turns out that

675
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:37,510
once you fall in love,

676
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:39,010
the self-protection mechanism

677
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,290
deep down inside will be activated

678
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:42,690
So you forgot everything about your lover

679
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,190
If I cooperate with treatment,

680
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,710
do I have the chance for complete recovery

681
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,060
Theoretically speaking,

682
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,590
if you can be open-minded,

683
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,760
you can get back to normal mentally

684
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,490
But people may have different

685
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,960
individual condition and the degree of coordination,

686
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,840
so the time needed and results of the treatment

687
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,810
will also be influenced at different level

688
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:20,360
See you next week

689
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,060
Thank you

690
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,460
What did the doctor say?

691
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,140
I'll come here three times every week

692
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:28,440
Okay

693
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,190
I'll make work schedule for you

694
00:39:30,690 --> 00:39:31,440
Thank you

695
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,540
Have a seat this way

696
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,840
I'll get you a drink or something

697
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:50,660
Ms. Ye

698
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,140
What do you want to say?

699
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,240
Out with it

700
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,710
or she will have no courage to return

701
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:02,660
The doctor has told you

702
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,760
the thing, right?

703
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:10,640
Honey,

704
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,360
I'm so sorry

705
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:15,940
I'm not

706
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,410
a good mother

707
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:20,560
I'm also the block in your life

708
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:21,810
If I had known it,

709
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,990
I would have never abandoned you that very year

710
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,240
You don't have to say sorry to me

711
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,440
You have the right to choose your own life

712
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,660
I don't blame you

713
00:40:31,910 --> 00:40:32,690
Really?

714
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,260
I ever did it

715
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,440
But now I don't

716
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,960
Do you know what

717
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,590
I regret most in my life?

718
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,110
The marriage to my dad?

719
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,340
In the fact,

720
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,090
I regret most that I didn't

721
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:02,510
be with you to see you

722
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,990
grow up

723
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:12,890
After I left your father,

724
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,540
I find myself

725
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:16,090
I traveled the world smartly

726
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:17,560
I live a carefree life

727
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:19,640
I knew

728
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,510
divorce wouldn't

729
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,360
change your father's personality,

730
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,210
but I still left the mess

731
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,490
to a child

732
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,960
After you lost your mother,

733
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,710
you had to face your serious father alone

734
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,310
Jingzhi,

735
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:43,710
I got freedom

736
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,740
at the expense of your happiness

737
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:49,390
It's all over

738
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,010
I'm happy now

739
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,340
Yes

740
00:41:59,810 --> 00:42:01,290
I really feel grateful that

741
00:42:01,290 --> 00:42:02,510
you're so successful

742
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,090
It seemed that I

743
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,660
did little things for you

744
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,860
in your growth

745
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,490
I felt great happy when you came to see me

746
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,090
when I was young

747
00:42:14,790 --> 00:42:15,540
But

748
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:18,610
I felt that you were so aloof

749
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:20,840
and you never told me that you missed me

750
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,540
I thought you didn't want see me

751
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:24,440
I know

752
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,810
whatever I say is of no use now

753
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,690
What can I do for you now?

754
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,240
I can be with you every day

755
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,840
I can take care of your children

756
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,260
You can continue your original life

757
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,560
Don't change anything for me

758
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,740
Then you'll be nice to me

759
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:46,860
Will you love me as before?

760
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,060
Of course

761
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:01,890
Honey

762
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:05,590
Can I cry for a while?

763
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:07,140
Please don't

764
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,360
Xingchen will see that

765
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:11,510
It's just what I want

766
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,710
I should complete my play, right?

767
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,690
You promised that you would go home, did you?

768
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,340
You're working overtime

769
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,990
I don't want to leave you here alone

770
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,240
Don't use me as an excuse

771
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:58,410
You just wanna complete the work you missed

772
00:43:58,590 --> 00:43:59,210
Stop laughing

773
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,660
I'm serious

774
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,270
You should relieve yourself now

775
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:05,590
Have a good rest

776
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:06,860
How about

777
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:09,690
you hand over all work to me

778
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,560
except those files needed your signature?

779
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:14,410
OK?

780
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,660
Is that OK, Mr. Yan?

781
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:21,990
Of course not

782
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:23,290
I don't want you to try so hard

783
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:25,410
Well, you can approve a paid leave for me

784
00:44:25,410 --> 00:44:28,160
when you finish your treatment

785
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:33,590
I'll give thought to it

786
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,110
if it is the marriage leave

787
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,160
For the tourism development tendency at home and abroad,

788
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,610
I'd like to introduce the

789
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:02,940
world tourism development in twenty first century

790
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,990
Have a look, Xingchen

791
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:21,810
Let's go

792
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:49,510
Enjoy

793
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:52,060
Try this

794
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,760
I gotta go

795
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,590
I'll leave my son with you

796
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:06,890
Rest assured, aunt

797
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:08,690
I'll update his recent developments at any time

798
00:46:09,290 --> 00:46:10,360
Take care

799
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,760
when you're in the competition

800
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,190
I really want you to be my

801
00:46:14,190 --> 00:46:16,110
daughter in law as soon as possible

802
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:17,890
Alright!

803
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:18,810
I'm leaving now

804
00:46:18,810 --> 00:46:20,040
I'll send you picture later

805
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:20,400
Okay

806
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:20,890
Let's hug

807
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:23,040
Safe and sound trip, aunt

808
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:24,290
Bye

809
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:25,240
See you
