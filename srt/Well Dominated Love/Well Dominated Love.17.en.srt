1
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:43,420
Alright!

2
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,720
It's ten o'clock

3
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:45,750
You should go home now!

4
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,020
Don't hang on here

5
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,420
Do you need a designated driver?

6
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,770
Your house is so big

7
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,020
Can't just sleep in the guest room?

8
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,220
That's okay!

9
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,620
Couch, floor and the bathroom

10
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,450
You can choose one

11
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,450
Could it be the property management staff?

12
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,970
Don't talk to me again!

13
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,470
Yan Jingzhi

14
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:21,800
Go! Go! Go!

15
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,850
Just say you aren't at home

16
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:23,650
Don't pretend!

17
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,720
I know you're at home

18
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:29,870
Go! Go! Go!

19
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,250
This way. This way. This way

20
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,520
Go in!

21
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,700
Don't come out!

22
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,900
Mr. Yan

23
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,650
It's so late. Is there anything I can help you?

24
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,870
Yes!

25
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,900
Then we can talk about it tomorrow

26
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,520
You use a facial mask everyday

27
00:02:58,700 --> 00:02:59,950
Are you allergic seriously?

28
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,220
My skin is in bad condition

29
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,050
I just get used to using the masks

30
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,450
You come out early and back late

31
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,670
Do you do that to hide from me?

32
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,570
Why do I hide from you?

33
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,950
Because you've been lying to me

34
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,500
What did I lie to you?

35
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,770
I've been to Yatai Technology

36
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,750
You aren't a staff there at all

37
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:22,170
You mean this!

38
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,750
I resign from there

39
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,420
What a coincidence!

40
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,520
Was it just that day when I drove you to work?

41
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,470
Yeah!

42
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,870
I resigned that day

43
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,150
Don't think me as a fool!

44
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,320
Coco is also a fake name, right!

45
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,550
Mr. Yan, I don't know what you are talking about

46
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,350
It's late

47
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,050
Let's talk about it tomorrow

48
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:38,750
Yan...

49
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,450
Yan...

50
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,200
Zhao Yuanfang

51
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:51,970
Yan Jingzhi

52
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:03,620
Nie Xingchen

53
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,270
Mr. Yan

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,400
It's always you!

55
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:10,150
Let me explain it to you!

56
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,850
You're Secretary Nie during the day

57
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,070
and Coco at night

58
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,320
Do you think it's funny

59
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,270
to screw around on me?

60
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,450
It isn't the way you think

61
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,020
It's unnecessary for her to do this if you hadn't lost your memory

62
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,520
It turns out that you know everything about what she did

63
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,000
You two echo each other in harmony!

64
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,350
Why don't you just get together?

65
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,800
Why didn't you set me up together?

66
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,570
Are you talking sense? You...

67
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:32,700
Zhao Yuanfang! Zhao Yuanfang!

68
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,370
Don't! Don't! Get your hands off me!

69
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,220
Zhao Yuanfang! Get your hands off me!

70
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,020
Nie Xingchen, let me tell you something

71
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,500
You impress me indeed

72
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,650
That's a tight hug!

73
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,200
Yan Jingzhi. Yan Jingzhi. Yan Jingzhi

74
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,650
Yan Jingzhi, let me explain it to you

75
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,620
It isn't the way you think

76
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:51,950
Jingzhi

77
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,450
What about now?

78
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,620
It can't be helped

79
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,850
Just let him calm down!

80
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,300
How come we were found by him under such circumstance?

81
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,720
Yan Jingzhi has lost his memory already

82
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,570
Why is he still annoying?

83
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,570
Why did you stop me just now?

84
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,070
Why didn't you let me give him a lesson?

85
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,100
Were you foes in previous life?

86
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,050
Why I have a fight with him every time

87
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,220
as long as you show up

88
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,900
Could I know him in the previous life?

89
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,400
Don't blame me for everything!

90
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,550
You're both childish!

91
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,670
Alright!

92
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:25,520
Go home!

93
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,820
Stop following me!

94
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,070
Xingchen

95
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,670
My clothes are still inside!

96
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,900
Okay!

97
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,120
You two!

98
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,500
You just bully me!

99
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:55,020
I'll keep that in mind

100
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,120
I‘m telling you that I won't come over here again

101
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,750
I won't come even you beg me!

102
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:00,570
You two just keep that in mind!

103
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:01,370
Do remember!

104
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,850
Do remember!

105
00:06:03,450 --> 00:06:04,420
Do remember!

106
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,400
What a useless elevator! So slow!

107
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,200
Bluetooth is connected

108
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,100
Yan Jingzhi

109
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,020
Can you hear me?

110
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,270
Sorry

111
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,820
I didn't mean to lie to you

112
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,820
I didn't even mean to screw around on you

113
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:37,920
I know

114
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,470
All the reasons I'm telling is futile

115
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:44,070
I’m willing to make up for my mistakes with practical actions

116
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,250
It's hard to make men happy from anger

117
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,650
You take this,

118
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,100
this file...

119
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,750
OK!

120
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,050
Sister Xingchen

121
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,400
Morning

122
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,220
Sister Xingchen

123
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:03,120
Xingchen

124
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,150
What's the matter?

125
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,850
Sister Xingchen, what's wrong with you?

126
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,470
Didn't she prove herself innocent?

127
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,350
Why is sister Xingchen still in bad mood?

128
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,970
I guess if she needs our

129
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,020
boss to inform to

130
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:23,820
officially clear her name so that

131
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,770
she can be happy again?

132
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,570
Little Tong Xin

133
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,420
This is the correct line you've said since

134
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,170
you came to this company

135
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:33,870
You can tell the boss on behalf of us

136
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,770
On behalf of you?

137
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,000
Go back to your seat!

138
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:47,100
After the news of signing a contract

139
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:47,950
with Hengji released yesterday,

140
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,220
we've received good market response

141
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,950
And the company's stock rose by $1.34,

142
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,700
a record of the biggest increase recently

143
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,220
So we decided to push forward during the period

144
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,150
At the early stage of the construction of tourist resorts,

145
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,450
we need to enter the marketing period to

146
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,150
get the market in gear

147
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,170
As large-scale in investment

148
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,200
and long in operation as the tourism industry is,

149
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,470
it's a sunrise industry

150
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,720
and we can always put to use

151
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,970
if it's well preserved

152
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:09,950
I hope everybody here can understand

153
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,520
what we're doing is not about a one-off business,

154
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,700
but about our business philosophy of sustainable development

155
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,450
I hope we can make it in the aspects of

156
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:18,050
basic services and facilities in the early stage of construction

157
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:18,850
However,

158
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,700
the construction of ecological and environmental protection facilities

159
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,700
is also the top priority

160
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:24,720
Did you finish making

161
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,420
the planning and blueprint of the tourist resort?

162
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,300
It's basically ready

163
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:27,970
Let's take a look

164
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,750
Why are you hesitating?

165
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:35,750
Mr. Yan

166
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:38,000
This planning is different from the one

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,550
we gave to Hengji

168
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,150
This is the overall planning of the tourist resort

169
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,020
Don't I know

170
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,620
what I'm about to see?

171
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,070
I mean...

172
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:47,770
Is Secretary Nie not appropriate to

173
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,850
know about

174
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:50,170
the core secret？

175
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,150
Mr. Liu

176
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,350
What do you mean?

177
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,920
We haven't checked out who is

178
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,150
the business spy

179
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:56,970
I just don't want

180
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,300
the fruit of

181
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,050
our colleagues of planning department

182
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,670
to be leaked out by someone deliberately

183
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:05,120
Mr. Liu

184
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,570
You received the news too late

185
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,020
Secretary Nie

186
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,120
You can just go out

187
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,200
Before we find the truth,

188
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,600
you don't have to attend the internal meeting of the company

189
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,350
Mr. Yan

190
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,250
Mr. Zhao

191
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:17,470
We all know that

192
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:19,350
Secretary Nie was an important help hand of you

193
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,620
But now, you should

194
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,120
put the interests of the company first

195
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:26,220
Mr. Zhao

196
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,470
I won't disturb you to continue

197
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:49,950
Go ahead!

198
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:51,350
OK!

199
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,520
Mr. Yan

200
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,250
You kicked down the ladder. That's a nice move!

201
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,220
I feel ashamed of my inferiority

202
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:08,770
Of course

203
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:11,120
Or why could Yuanda be acquired by me?

204
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,220
I once thought Mr. Yan

205
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:15,850
was just annoying in daily life

206
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,720
But for work, there is nothing to blame

207
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:20,100
But I didn't expect that you cannot distinguish what's your own and what's public

208
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:22,120
If you let Xingchen be framed by others deliberately

209
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:25,200
because of what happened last night,

210
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,220
then you'd rather fire her

211
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,100
Mr. Zhao, you've gone too far on this matter

212
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,670
Secretary Nie is a member of PO

213
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,450
I can deal with this

214
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,820
Don't bother!

215
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,050
You'll regret it

216
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,420
if you remember all

217
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,000
Secretary Nie

218
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,550
Maybe Mr. Yan have other considerations of you

219
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,520
What consideration?

220
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,300
It just can be made clear in a word, right?

221
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:10,600
Tong Xin

222
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,150
Stop talking!

223
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,950
What Mr. Yan has done

224
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,370
is hard for us to understand indeed,

225
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,170
right?

226
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,250
It's obvious that sister Xingchen has exerted much efforts

227
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,350
on this project

228
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,100
But she was regarded as a business spy

229
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,850
Anyone who listens to this would feel bitterly disappointed

230
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,220
Yeah! Stop talking!

231
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,820
What I said is right!

232
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,620
She was driven out during the meeting

233
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,720
The rumor of this matter

234
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,450
will spread unchecked

235
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,720
Sister Xingchen, where are you going? Sister Xingchen!

236
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:38,900
Is Mr. Yan in?

237
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:39,370
Yes

238
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,000
Secretary Nie

239
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,350
Secretary Nie

240
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,320
Secretary Jin

241
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,200
It's okay

242
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:45,770
Make a coffee for me, please!

243
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,350
Okay!

244
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,320
The reason why you're here

245
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,320
is just to ask

246
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,920
why didn't explain for you, right?

247
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,900
With my efforts all day and night,

248
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,620
I finally got the Hengji project

249
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,800
Why didn't you explain anything for me?

250
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:04,900
Why?

251
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,970
I don't have to explain for you

252
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,520
before we find the truth

253
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:09,850
I know you want to fire me

254
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:11,450
It's not helpful whatever I do now

255
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,300
Secretary Nie

256
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,420
I don't hope what happened will happen again

257
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,020
If you have no idea about what's professional quality

258
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,800
and self-control ability,

259
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,800
you can learn it from Secretary Jin

260
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,520
I hope you won't

261
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,220
work with personal emotions in the company

262
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,270
Who on earth is the man did that?

263
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:25,900
Okay!

264
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,570
Don't bother about me

265
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:28,750
If you're catching a chance to fire me,

266
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,050
I can sign my name now

267
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,300
You can write whatever reason why you would

268
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:37,220
Okay!

269
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,900
I can keep your things,

270
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,350
but you cannot go

271
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:41,150
Why?

272
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,070
During the period you were my secretary,

273
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,400
there were a lot of important documents in your hands

274
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,750
I can sign a confidentiality contract

275
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,620
Before the final conclusion the matter of Hengji,

276
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,570
I'm required to give

277
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:48,800
an explanation to all shareholders of the company

278
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,220
You're required to accept

279
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,170
the most rigorous review of the company

280
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:51,950
I know

281
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,220
You just want to make me a scapegoat!

282
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,450
OK! No problem

283
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,620
I'll be waiting

284
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,350
Mr. Yan

285
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:10,870
The Hengji project

286
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,120
was finally gotten by Secretary Nie

287
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:14,150
Can't it explain

288
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,670
she isn't a business spy?

289
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,050
Then who knows

290
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,270
whether she wants to avoid legal sanction

291
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,850
Before the final conclusion of the investigation,

292
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,520
I'll keep my doubts

293
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,250
Understood

294
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:47,150
Hello, Yuanfang

295
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,170
Don't bother

296
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,370
You don't need to come to me

297
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,220
I'm fine

298
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,550
I can deal with this

299
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,220
Then I'm hanging up!

300
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,570
Secretary Nie

301
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,570
I've been looking for you for a while!

302
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,320
What's the matter?

303
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,300
Do you mind having a word?

304
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:23,150
What's you plan in future?

305
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,150
Can I have any plan?

306
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,550
I was poured down a basin of blames,

307
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:30,820
which stinks my reputation

308
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,150
There should be no floor for me in Jinghai

309
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,370
Although I just returned to Jinghai,

310
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,500
I knew a few friends

311
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,150
I help recommend you to some of them

312
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,770
Do you believe I'm not a business spy?

313
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,370
I haven't knew you for a long time,

314
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,100
but I believe in your moral quality

315
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,270
Even you believe me

316
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:05,150
Even I've worked hard for Mr. Yan for such a long time,

317
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,820
he doesn't believe me!

318
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,850
That's ridiculous!

319
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,570
Mr. Yan is just careful in everything

320
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,470
You don't have to explain for him

321
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,000
We all know that

322
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:20,420
he wanted to fire me long ago

323
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,400
I feel humbled as I think about it

324
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,170
It's obvious I didn't do anything

325
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:30,750
But I'm the biggest scapegoat

326
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,220
It's better to leave

327
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,200
after taking all blames

328
00:16:40,650 --> 00:16:41,720
I'm joking!

329
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,020
Then I'm leaving

330
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:13,800
Secretary Jin

331
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,950
Please help me deliver the document to Mr. Yan

332
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:16,800
OK!

333
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:18,800
I'll get off work

334
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,750
Are you going with me?

335
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,000
No

336
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,400
Mr. Yan told me to arrange files before he left

337
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,350
I haven't done yet

338
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,000
Okay!

339
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,500
Sorry!

340
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,670
I changed my password

341
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,170
Secretary Nie

342
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,420
How come you come back?

343
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,770
When I arranged the documents,

344
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,750
I found there missed a financial statement of the company

345
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:43,470
The finance department should have left work by now,

346
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,870
so I wanted to check if you had a backup

347
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,450
But I've forgotten you changed the password

348
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,100
Really?

349
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,550
Did you enter my office and open my computer

350
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,850
for information?

351
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,300
Secretary Jin

352
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,000
You acted so calm!

353
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:05,700
But what I need to tell you is

354
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,300
I just installed a camera in my office

355
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:13,570
So,

356
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,770
when did you find this?

357
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:18,400
Yesterday

358
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,200
I got the planning of Hengji given by Xuhui

359
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:23,870
And I found a problem

360
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:29,750
What's this?

361
00:19:30,370 --> 00:19:32,570
This is a planning of our company before

362
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,500
But this

363
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,950
is the planning given by Xuhui to Mr. Liao

364
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,270
I know

365
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:40,500
Although this time

366
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,300
I signed a contract with Hengji,

367
00:19:42,670 --> 00:19:43,550
that couldn't prove

368
00:19:43,670 --> 00:19:45,220
I wasn't the business spy

369
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,650
So I came to Mr. Liao

370
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,250
to get the planning given by Xuhui

371
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,420
And I made a comparison

372
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:50,620
But what happened?

373
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,050
We were very lucky!

374
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,100
Maybe Xuhui was overconfident that

375
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,350
we couldn't catch anything,

376
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:57,550
so there was no revision of the planning

377
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:00,100
However,

378
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,670
the page number of the company's planning lies in the middle,

379
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,970
but it's on the right on this one

380
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,000
What can this prove anything?

381
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,820
I'm used to adding page number after I finish writing

382
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,500
So when the thief saw the planning,

383
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,120
there should be no page number

384
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:24,800
And she just made her own decision

385
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,270
to add the page number

386
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,120
But she forgot you like symmetry

387
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,200
So all the documents handled in by PO,

388
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,550
the page number on them

389
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,870
are in the middle

390
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,100
That has become a conditioned reflex of us

391
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,570
Only those who joined the company for a short time

392
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,220
don't have this habit

393
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,220
Secretary Jin

394
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:46,800
Xuhui Real Estate

395
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,300
trained you well indeed

396
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,320
to cater Mr. Yan's preference so as to send you in our company

397
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,100
But they forgot

398
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,500
that some tiny habits

399
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,400
cannot changes in one day

400
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,100
As for how did you get access to my computer...

401
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,250
In fact, there aren't really too many documents in our company

402
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,150
for the chief secretary to print

403
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:07,920
And

404
00:21:08,470 --> 00:21:10,120
that day I arranged the planning,

405
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,150
I went out once

406
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,050
to get a file for you

407
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:18,620
So,

408
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,220
everything happened today

409
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,970
is just a play of you two partners?

410
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,150
It's not much of partners

411
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:30,400
The reason why you're here

412
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,500
is just to ask

413
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,950
the thing why I didn't explain for you

414
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,050
No!

415
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:37,170
I just want you to listen to my explanation

416
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,500
The house I live in

417
00:21:42,150 --> 00:21:43,420
was you deliberately arranged for me

418
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:45,000
before you lost memory

419
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,720
Maybe you wanted to give me a surprise

420
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
But you've lost memory when I knew

421
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,450
And you had a deep misunderstanding on Secretary Nie

422
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,800
So I wanted to move there

423
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,820
to let you know me again

424
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:00,250
with less bias

425
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,720
I didn't mean to lie to you

426
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,520
You came to me just

427
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,270
to confess this to you,

428
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,120
Okay!

429
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,020
I worked so hard that

430
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,020
I signed the contract with Hengji

431
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,270
Why didn't you explain anything for me?

432
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,420
Why?

433
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,600
Before the final conclusion of the investigation,

434
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,150
before we find the truth

435
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,450
I can sign my name now

436
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,550
you can write any reason to fire me

437
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,200
Okay!

438
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,970
I can keep your things

439
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,550
but you cannot go

440
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,650
So you meant it in this noon

441
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:18,600
when you said to take all blames

442
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,200
before you went

443
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,500
If I didn't say like that,

444
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,950
how could you pluck up the courage

445
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:25,470
to set me up the second time?

446
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,700
Take the evidence and Secretary Jin away!

447
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:34,150
You and the Xuhui Real Estate behind you,

448
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:36,450
I'll definitely follow it on

449
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,270
This way

450
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,020
How do you know we were acting play?

451
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,490
I didn't know

452
00:23:58,920 --> 00:23:59,970
But I believe you.

453
00:24:06,970 --> 00:24:07,490
Alright!

454
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,620
We can go home

455
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:09,770
It's just the same destination

456
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:10,720
We have different destinations

457
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,170
We just joined hands to catch the spy

458
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:16,090
It isn't appropriate for you to pretend to know nothing after it's over

459
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,790
Secretary Nie

460
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,220
Your ability at work is worthy of recognition

461
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:20,640
So I decide to

462
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:23,920
reappoint you as my Chief Secretary

463
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:25,920
Really?

464
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,620
I can always distinguish between public and private affairs

465
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,740
So you can just go home by taxi

466
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,190
And

467
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,690
I don't forgive you for lying to me

468
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,220
And

469
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,940
Your painting is really ugly

470
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:42,240
I polished it for you

471
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,020
Take it as a reward

472
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:55,370
What's this?

473
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:00,340
Yan Jingzhi

474
00:26:01,270 --> 00:26:03,920
Actually, I just want to say

475
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:05,970
thank you

476
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,140
for coming back to me

477
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,140
Thank you

478
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,440
You haven't given up on us for 5 years

479
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,790
So this time,

480
00:26:15,390 --> 00:26:16,770
whatever will happen,

481
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,890
let me protect you

482
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:37,990
Have you ever seen the note?

483
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,620
Press it!

484
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,890
What are you hesitating about?

485
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,370
What the hell!

486
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,320
Jingzhi

487
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,540
Why are you here?

488
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,790
Is this the second time I forgot Nie Xingchen?

489
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,290
Finally you come to ask me!

490
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,740
What do you want to know?

491
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:14,920
All of!

492
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,740
I pieced the words of you

493
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,770
and Miss Nie

494
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,290
and I got that story

495
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:44,090
So what illness do I have?

496
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:45,090
Why did I forget

497
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,540
all things related to her?

498
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:49,240
I've been in contact with Dr. William

499
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,140
in these days

500
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,370
He is one of leading figures in the study

501
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,190
of contemporary cranial nerve science

502
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,670
At present, we already have

503
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,090
the probable inference direction

504
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,570
So?

505
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,670
Sorry!

506
00:29:03,870 --> 00:29:05,340
I cannot tell you now

507
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:07,670
Han Ziyu

508
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:09,320
I'm a patient

509
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,590
I have right to know about it, right?

510
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,270
The uncertain result

511
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,020
can just lead to unnecessary speculation

512
00:29:14,370 --> 00:29:15,170
I'm a doctor

513
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,890
I have to take responsibility for what I say

514
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:18,790
Okay!

515
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,090
Doctor Han!

516
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:22,190
Please be concentrated on your study

517
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,470
and find the cause of my illness as soon as possible

518
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,270
Thanks for your hard work!

519
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,190
I'm leaving!

520
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,090
I'd do that if you don't say like this

521
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:27,990
By the way

522
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:31,870
You can just think about it!

523
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,890
You came to me to learn what happened in the past

524
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,070
Does this prove that you fall in love with her again?

525
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,640
You're overthinking!

526
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,670
I just temporarily came to an end on business

527
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,590
and have spare time to deal with the problems

528
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,840
left in my life

529
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,690
Doctor Han!

530
00:29:49,170 --> 00:29:50,870
Can you just focus on your study

531
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,440
and stop gossiping?

532
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,540
You're just being false of heart

533
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:15,670
Morning! Morning!

534
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:35,690
I have something to announce here

535
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:37,790
From today on,

536
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,520
Secretary Nie will officially resume

537
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,940
her post of chief Secretary

538
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:52,990
Welcome back!

539
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,220
Great!

540
00:30:55,070 --> 00:30:56,540
Great! Sister Xingchen

541
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,590
I miss you so much!

542
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:01,390
Welcome back!

543
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,090
Come over here!

544
00:31:02,090 --> 00:31:03,020
Finally you're back! You're back eventually!

545
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,290
Really! You're back! That makes us so happy!

546
00:31:10,190 --> 00:31:11,070
Sister Xingchen

547
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,770
These are the tourism marketing companies

548
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,190
chosen by the Marketing Department

549
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,470
They hope Mr. Yan can choose one to cooperate

550
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,790
That's impossible!

551
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:21,320
What Mr. Yan wants to see is not their core ideas

552
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:22,570
and excellent cases,

553
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,390
but the characteristics of differentiation between these companies

554
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,470
and our basic idea over our tourist resort

555
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,740
Tell them to make a comparative report again

556
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,490
OK!

557
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:34,190
Xingchen

558
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,640
And Jinghai University would like to invite Mr. Yan

559
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,740
to deliver a lecture

560
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,170
on 17 of this month

561
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,520
What about the theme of the lecture?

562
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,720
It's up to us

563
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:44,140
There seems to be a business forum on that day, right?

564
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:45,690
Yes

565
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:47,540
Don't be too

566
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,640
hurry to refuse

567
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,570
Maybe

568
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,690
Mr. Yan would rather to

569
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:53,520
Okay, I see

570
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,720
Secretary Nie

571
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,690
Come over here! Over here!

572
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,840
Secretary Nie

573
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,790
It's so great you come back!

574
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:02,490
Look,

575
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,670
this office is in order

576
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,490
During the period when you weren't here,

577
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,040
it was all by myself!

578
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,020
These brats never saved worry for me!

579
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,290
That frustrated me a lot!

580
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,290
Then I need to buy some more wolfberry tea

581
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,470
Keep that in mind!

582
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:21,870
I heard Secretary Jin was taken away by the police

583
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,590
Everyone needs to be responsible for what he did

584
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,020
That meets to her nemesis!

585
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:31,970
That's the so called the wages of...

586
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,920
The wages of sin is death!

587
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,120
That's the death!

588
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,390
Then I continue with my work

589
00:32:38,670 --> 00:32:39,540
Sister Xingchen

590
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:40,890
I...I...

591
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,740
I have a relative

592
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,190
brought me chocolate from abroad

593
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:44,220
I give it to you

594
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,470
Why don't we have that?

595
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,220
Yeah

596
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:49,940
Sun Yang

597
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,270
Boy gives chocolate to girls

598
00:32:52,840 --> 00:32:54,040
Is there any affection over her?

599
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,120
Yeah! Affection!

600
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:59,040
I...I didn't mean that!

601
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:02,070
I just want to congratulate sister Xingchen for her resumption of post

602
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,290
Look at you! Why are you blushing?

603
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:04,770
No, I didn't

604
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:05,840
Look, your ears turn red

605
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,690
No

606
00:33:06,690 --> 00:33:07,820
You're red from head to foot

607
00:33:07,970 --> 00:33:08,440
No

608
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,220
Well

609
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,370
Don't tease at him!

610
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,590
Thank you! Sun Yang

611
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,440
Everybody can share the chocolate

612
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,420
Please come in

613
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:33,520
Mr. Yan

614
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:34,990
I put the files that needs to be handled

615
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,290
in the red folder

616
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,520
And according to the urgency of the document,

617
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,390
the rest are yellow, blue and white folders respectively

618
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,140
And

619
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,320
On 17 of this month, Jinghai University

620
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:46,220
would like you to deliver a lecture,

621
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,890
but there's a clash between the lecture and the business

622
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,570
Do you think which one you're gonna to choose

623
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:51,790
How do you think?

624
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:54,770
Jinghai University is the best here,

625
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:57,590
and there will be the peak of job hunting in a few months

626
00:33:58,540 --> 00:33:59,970
You can take this opportunity to

627
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:01,870
sign an agreement of talent transfer

628
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:03,690
to recruit outstanding talents in advance with the university

629
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,420
I'd do just as what you said

630
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:07,570
Okay!

631
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,690
Then I'll make the schedule

632
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:21,940
What are you doing here now?

633
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:23,190
Are you here for Mr. Yan?

634
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,340
What am I looking him for?

635
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,290
I'm here for you!

636
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,570
Secretary Nie

637
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,490
is really good at doing great things in silence

638
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:32,290
You just KO Jin Beina without a revealing movement

639
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,540
You saved my face indeed

640
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,670
You didn't see that

641
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,720
the Mr. Liu of Publicity Department

642
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:39,490
Her suddenly turned hostile

643
00:34:39,990 --> 00:34:41,270
Why did she turn hostile?

644
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,140
Can I deliberately put her to trouble?

645
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,140
She just offended you yesterday

646
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:47,140
and you resumed post today

647
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,720
Then let's play for time on the planning of their office

648
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,220
It's an easy task, isn't it?

649
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:51,940
But what a pity!

650
00:34:51,940 --> 00:34:52,870
You aren't of that kind

651
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,140
It's good for you to know that

652
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:54,970
Stand up!

653
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,040
I'm working!

654
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:03,990
What about now?

655
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,490
You've handled him again?

656
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,290
Not yet!

657
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,240
As the saying goes well,"

658
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:16,490
who's unavailable to you is the best!"

659
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:18,220
Do you want to prove

660
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:19,690
the correctness of this line?

661
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:20,990
We're in the company!

662
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,870
No monkey business!

663
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,620
Mr. Yan is watching!

664
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:31,290
Men know each other best!

665
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:32,490
Be happy!

666
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,940
He's already jealous

667
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:34,890
Mr. Zhao

668
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:37,920
Mr. Yan

669
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,020
There you are!

670
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:41,940
I heard Secretary Nie resumed her post

671
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:42,890
So I came to tell my congrats

672
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,190
It's working time now

673
00:35:44,470 --> 00:35:45,790
Okay! Okay! Okay! I'm leaving!

674
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:47,990
By the way

675
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:49,620
Mr. Yan acted the play well that day

676
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,290
You can think about showbiz

677
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,420
Xingchen, I'm leaving

678
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,640
Mr. Yan

679
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,020
Is there anything I can help you?

680
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,670
Can't I take a look here when I'm free?

681
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,790
Fortunately!

682
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,290
How childish!

683
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,040
I

684
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,220
want to learn to sing

685
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:27,490
What do you think?

686
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,570
I think it's alright!

687
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,940
After all, it's your hobby!

688
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,740
Now, I'm retired... Dr. Han!

689
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,840
Tong Xin

690
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,320
Are you okay?

691
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:43,890
It's okay

692
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:52,190
I'll take this as desensitization treatment today

693
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,270
Thank you!

694
00:37:05,690 --> 00:37:06,340
Hello

695
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,340
I'm a fan of Dr. Han

696
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,490
Hello, young lady!

697
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,820
I'm Dr. Han's dad

698
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:13,840
Nice to meet you!

699
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:16,320
Dad?

700
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,020
Dad

701
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:27,540
Aren't you going to eat?

702
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:29,290
Let's just wait for a while

703
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,120
For what?

704
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:32,840
Just wait!

705
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,640
Sorry, I'm late!

706
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,470
Mom!

707
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,220
How come you're here?

708
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,820
Hello... Hello, Aunt!

709
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:49,340
Take the seat!

710
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,340
Hi,

711
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,340
how old are you?

712
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:54,870
Where are you from?

713
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,720
What do you do?

714
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:58,920
What do your parents do?

715
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:00,940
Aunt

716
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:02,890
Aunt, my name is Tong Xin

717
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:04,690
I was born in 1995

718
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:05,720
I'm a local native

719
00:38:05,990 --> 00:38:07,470
My job is...

720
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,670
These don't matter! Don't matter!

721
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:14,490
Are you really in love with Ziyu?

722
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,290
The news has spread all over the hospital

723
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,420
Could it be fake?

724
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,090
It's

725
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:24,890
so great!

726
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,820
Thanks to you!

727
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,020
I always think

728
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,940
my son is mentally ill

729
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:31,890
Mom!

730
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:34,670
Xinxin

731
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:37,370
When are you going to get married?

732
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,790
Get married?

733
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:42,420
It must be late if you

734
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:43,820
want to give birth to a baby in the year of pig

735
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,440
But it's also good to have one in the year of mouse

736
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,540
What do you think?

737
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:47,570
Mom!

738
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,990
You scared her!

739
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:50,820
We're just

740
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,090
in a relationship

741
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,670
and are far away from getting married

742
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,520
Are you going to fool around if you don't want to get married?

743
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:00,270
Han

744
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:02,690
Ziyu

745
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,240
When we were young,

746
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:06,620
there would be punishment on hooliganism

747
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:08,570
No! No! No!

748
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,620
Uncle, aunt

749
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:12,690
I think I'm still young

750
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,490
And I'm not in a rush to get married

751
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,290
Xinxin

752
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:18,970
For such a relationship

753
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,720
It's better for it to continue for few years

754
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:23,390
You can continue falling in love with each other after getting married

755
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,890
If you get married with Ziyu,

756
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:28,440
he'll be really a good husband

757
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:29,140
You

758
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,690
must grasp him!

759
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,490
I know, aunt

760
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,570
In my heart,

761
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:36,740
there's no better person than Dr. Han

762
00:39:37,090 --> 00:39:38,670
I'm the number one fan of him

763
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,590
Why are you still calling Dr. Han?

764
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,570
Ziyu

765
00:39:51,470 --> 00:39:52,540
Look,

766
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:53,820
That's right!

767
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:55,340
Mom!

768
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:56,970
We haven't eaten yet!

769
00:39:58,790 --> 00:39:59,420
Oh, yes, yes!

770
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,240
Xinxin

771
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,470
Are you hungry?

772
00:40:01,470 --> 00:40:02,090
Come on!

773
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,420
What do you like to eat? I'm picking dishes for you!

774
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:06,440
Look at you!

775
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,840
Xinxin hasn't eaten yet

776
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,770
Xinxin

777
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:10,490
Come on!

778
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,170
You should eat meat more

779
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,240
Thank you, aunt

780
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,240
Come on! Eat more meat

781
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,260
You look too skinny!

782
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,070
Thank you, aunt

783
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:16,990
Eat more!

784
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:18,540
Come on! Come on! Come on! Eat more!

785
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:19,390
Eat more!

786
00:40:36,370 --> 00:40:37,390
Here you are, Mr. Zhao

787
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,020
Where's Zhen Nian?

788
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,340
She's in the dressing room

789
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:43,640
Thank you!

790
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,620
It was already agreed that the character was mine

791
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:50,340
I declined so many programs for this

792
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:51,670
and I practiced boxing for three months

793
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:52,920
It's on the point of shooting

794
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,540
But you're telling me someone has taken my place

795
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:55,990
Niannian

796
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:58,290
Your termination with Mr. Yan in private

797
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:01,020
has caused a bigger impact than you expected

798
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,340
I thought I've been in

799
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,620
the showbiz for so many years

800
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:12,540
90% depended on my efforts

801
00:41:13,790 --> 00:41:15,820
and 10% on Yan Jingzhi

802
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,790
Now it seems

803
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,970
that I misunderstood

804
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,220
It's ridiculous to think about it

805
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:24,840
Alright!

806
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:26,320
Don't be dispirited!

807
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:28,690
I'll get you better programs

808
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,620
I want to stay alone

809
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,640
Then I'll go out first

810
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,140
Miss Zhen

811
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:46,190
I'm here again!

812
00:41:50,390 --> 00:41:51,190
Mr. Zhao, Don't you know

813
00:41:51,190 --> 00:41:53,390
knocking at the door is a basic courtesy?

814
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:55,490
It's open

815
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:56,370
so I come in

816
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:59,420
I just want to remind Miss Zhao

817
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:00,920
that you should take publicity photos

818
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:03,970
You are so busy everyday

819
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:05,590
You still have spare time to follow

820
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:07,070
such a little promo

821
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:08,340
You're really dedicated!

822
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,820
I don't want to, either

823
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:13,190
But the protagonist we invited isn't reliable

824
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:15,120
I don't want to follow this promo here

825
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,570
I feel annoyed, too

826
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,770
Then please you go out for a few minutes

827
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,070
I'm going to change clothes

828
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,340
What are you doing now?

829
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:06,990
Wireless micro camera!

830
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:12,590
Call the police!

831
00:43:29,090 --> 00:43:29,940
Is there anything I can help you?

832
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:34,760
I just wondered if you'd like to have a drink together

833
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,290
Come in

834
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:48,640
You're looking over the stuff of us five years ago?

835
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,020
I want to try if I can remember anything

836
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,170
Then

837
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,020
do you feel these things familiar?

838
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:06,420
No

839
00:44:17,770 --> 00:44:18,770
These cannot be changed

840
00:44:19,270 --> 00:44:20,440
Of course I cannot feel familiar

841
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:26,270
I got an idea!

842
00:44:27,070 --> 00:44:28,020
What idea?

843
00:44:38,370 --> 00:44:39,590
Can you feel familiar?

844
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:43,020
That's a peach flavor!

845
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:53,770
There wasn't enough time just now

846
00:44:54,390 --> 00:44:54,890
Let's do it again

847
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:41,940
Please help me recover my memory!

848
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:44,370
No!

849
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:52,220
Can you tell me what this is?

850
00:45:54,970 --> 00:45:56,490
Like a fool!

851
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,420
What's this?

852
00:46:27,070 --> 00:46:28,090
Is there anything I can help you?

853
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,090
I just wondered

854
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,090
if you'd like to have a drink together

855
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:35,820
Come in
