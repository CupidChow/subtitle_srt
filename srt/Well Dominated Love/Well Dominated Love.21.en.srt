1
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:45,830
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

2
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:51,980
I can find over the sky where you are!

3
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:57,780
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

4
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,830
I can find over the sky where you are!

5
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:10,400
So shining up so high above the sky

6
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,300
Twinkle...

7
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,410
Sorry, sir

8
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,250
Dear

9
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:20,370
Go! Let's go back

10
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:28,830
Sir

11
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,090
Sorry for

12
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,300
disturbing you just now

13
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,810
We'll deal with it

14
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,970
I can remember

15
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,630
I can remember

16
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,870
Sir, your computer! Sir

17
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:52,630
Sir

18
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,940
May I ask who you are looking for?

19
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:55,660
Sorry for

20
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:56,770
I mistook you as someone else

21
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,860
Where on earth have you been?

22
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,130
Hello

23
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:11,840
A glass of water

24
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,070
You come to the bar to drink water again

25
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:15,870
Wasn't there water supply in your home?

26
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,600
Why didn't you answer my phone?

27
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,250
Did you hide from me?

28
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,090
I work earnestly, responsibly and conscientiously,

29
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,040
get along well with my colleagues

30
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,000
and behave well in the company

31
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:27,470
I didn't do anything wrong

32
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,470
Why am I hiding from you?

33
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,060
You know where Xingchen is, right?

34
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,310
Mr. Yan

35
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,680
As far as I know,

36
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,730
you haven't broken up with Xingchen, have you?

37
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,570
And I went online last time,

38
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,140
I saw your affair with Miss Zhen Nian

39
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,600
Now that you have a new lover,

40
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,340
and you pester your ex-girlfriend

41
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,170
It's not appropriate to do so

42
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:49,080
Zhen Nian and I are just friends

43
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,530
I asked her for a favor last time

44
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,160
What?

45
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:54,860
Playacting!

46
00:04:58,770 --> 00:04:59,800
Mr. Yan

47
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,870
Have you watched too many idol dramas?

48
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,050
If there's a love training class,

49
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,610
I suggest you go to the class for further study

50
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,080
If Nie Xingchen

51
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,580
broke up with you solely because of this,

52
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,180
she wouldn't wait for you for five years

53
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,760
I know

54
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,280
I'm silly

55
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:19,330
You would say yourself silly?

56
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,070
That's news!

57
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,400
I remember what happened five years ago

58
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:31,500
So?

59
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,660
Do you want to save the relationship?

60
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,530
Is Nie Xingchen your pet that

61
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,190
you can make her come and go as you want?

62
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:39,650
Sorry!

63
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,800
I didn't keep my promise

64
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,290
Don't say sorry to me

65
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,230
Say it to Xingchen

66
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,360
You cannot find her, right?

67
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,000
Where is she?

68
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:53,860
Do you want to know?

69
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,440
Waiter

70
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,680
Show my stock of wine

71
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,220
Doesn't Mr. Yan like even numbers?

72
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,510
One two, two bottles

73
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,960
I'll tell you when you finish drinking these

74
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,890
It's easy to kill yourself if you continue to drink like this

75
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:27,510
Xingchen is stubborn,

76
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:29,040
so I tell it to you

77
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,450
She went back to her hometown

78
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,170
You may find the address

79
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,190
But I'm warning you

80
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:42,470
it's the last chance for you

81
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:43,850
If you dare to hurt her again,

82
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,900
I'll wring your neck!

83
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,160
Thanks

84
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:54,720
Waiter

85
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,580
Lay my wine back

86
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,070
That bottle

87
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,470
It's yours

88
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:21,560
Go home

89
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,160
Go home right now

90
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:30,640
Mr. Yan

91
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,110
Why do you come here? It's late

92
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:32,730
Director Huang

93
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,320
Why are you in my house?

94
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:36,490
Mr. Yan

95
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,230
Your spirit of putting the company first

96
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,380
is really worth learning for me

97
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,490
But the...

98
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,230
You drank?

99
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,130
You drank?

100
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:43,620
Director Huang

101
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:46,610
Book me a ticket to Shashi

102
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,530
No problem

103
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,360
You'll go for investigation, won't you?

104
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,750
I'll arrange someone to pick you up

105
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,350
It's my private affair

106
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,550
Understood

107
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,930
How many days will you go there?

108
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,340
Director Huang

109
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:05,210
What's the duty of director of PO?

110
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:12,240
To share the worries of the president wholeheartedly

111
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,940
Here comes the opportunity

112
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,040
Opportunity?

113
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,830
Grasp it!

114
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,080
Grasp it!

115
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,350
I must grasp it!

116
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,630
In order to reach a smooth cooperation

117
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:55,390
and avoid unnecessary trouble,

118
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,580
I expressly recorded a self-introduction

119
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,870
So that it'll be your intimate companion

120
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,960
in the late night

121
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,570
or when you fly and take a bus

122
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,640
Hello, Dr. Han

123
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,380
I decide to grandly introduce myself

124
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,650
to you

125
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,030
My name is Tong Xin

126
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:23,620
Twenty five years old

127
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:25,550
Aries and Blood type B

128
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,850
People say I often do things on impulse

129
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,210
But I think that's a manifestation of my action

130
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:30,980
Do I know you well?

131
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,000
Who are you?

132
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,680
I'm the president of Dr. Han's Fan Club

133
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:38,140
I'm the only female patient of Dr. Han

134
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,590
I'm the girlfriend of Dr. Han

135
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,460
Beside my job,

136
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,860
I have multiple skills like taking pictures, retouching pictures,

137
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,760
editing and snapping up tickets

138
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:51,380
As a dream girl in the new era,

139
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,610
I'm a one-guy girl

140
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,450
with firmness of mind

141
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,540
and asking for no return

142
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:55,850
Generally speaking,

143
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:56,960
being my idol will

144
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,010
make you lose nothing

145
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,580
I'll be a good president of your fan club

146
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,150
The end

147
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:44,700
Which household are you going to?

148
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,500
Hi, aunt

149
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,020
I want to Nie Xingchen's

150
00:10:47,670 --> 00:10:49,420
What are you going to Xingxing's for?

151
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,960
I'm the boss of the company she works in

152
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,070
I specially come to visit

153
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,060
None of their family is here,

154
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,400
they went to visit relatives in hometown

155
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,950
Then, aunt, do you know the address?

156
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,700
I know,

157
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,190
but...

158
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,120
My company is going out of business

159
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,500
We're just waiting for her to back and help

160
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,570
Hello, Jingzhi

161
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,800
Are you in the company?

162
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,000
I just stop by

163
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,730
and come up to see you

164
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,770
I'm in Xingchen's hometown

165
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,480
What are you doing there?

166
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,160
I remember what happened five years ago

167
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,390
Really?

168
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:25,890
OK! OK! OK!

169
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,220
Then do remember come over the hospital to be examined

170
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,480
when you come back

171
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,580
I know. I'm hanging up

172
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:30,820
A minute please

173
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,640
Tong Xin is working in the company

174
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,200
Bye

175
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,780
What reason can I use to see her upstairs?

176
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,530
Mr. Yan isn't in the company

177
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,300
Director Huang is too busy

178
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,080
to have time for lunch

179
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,190
Sun

180
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,030
You're going for lunch with us two beauties,

181
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:58,310
it's your treat, right?

182
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:00,110
I didn't bring my wallet

183
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:01,410
Look at you!

184
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,090
Listen to me

185
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,550
Can I have performance fee?

186
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:12,770
I punch you

187
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,810
Go! Go! Go!

188
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:28,200
It's been a while!

189
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,820
You didn't go to the hospital recently

190
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,210
I've been busy at work

191
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:37,770
You've been busy!

192
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,460
In falling in love, right?

193
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:40,700
Sweetie

194
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,730
Wherever else do you want to go today,

195
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,490
I'll go with you

196
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:44,920
Stop displaying affection in front of me!

197
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,790
Every single day!

198
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,530
Can I have a word with Tong Xin in private?

199
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:52,560
Yeah!

200
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,590
Sweetie,

201
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,530
Hurry up. I'm waiting you!

202
00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,090
Well, not bad

203
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:04,960
I didn't expect that

204
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:07,430
you fell in love so soon

205
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,540
Is there anything you want to say to me?

206
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:20,670
Congratulations!

207
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,080
I forgot to tell you that

208
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:31,850
I cannot be the president of your fan club

209
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,420
It doesn't matter, does it?

210
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:36,720
That's alright

211
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,980
I also want to thank you for your help

212
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,590
these days

213
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:46,070
You're very much welcome

214
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:48,820
You invited me to have a dinner anyway

215
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:56,560
Then

216
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,660
I also wish you and Dr. Bai well

217
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,500
I...

218
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,680
Little Xinxin

219
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,790
Let's go for lunch. I'm so hungry!

220
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,490
Let's go. Sweetie

221
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:07,560
Then I'll leave first

222
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,110
Go! Go!

223
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,910
Don't look back!

224
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,570
What's the matter?

225
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,340
It's over!

226
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,720
It's really the end between us

227
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:37,890
End what!

228
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,470
If he really has a feeling for you,

229
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,070
he'll definitely come to you

230
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,720
Then if he has no feeling for me?

231
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,180
I punch you!

232
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,290
Come on

233
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:48,390
Don't be upset!

234
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,220
Let's go to eat something delicious

235
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,850
Yeah! Yeah! Go! Go! Go!

236
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:51,540
At the very beginning, we just... Let's go for lunch!

237
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,320
Sir

238
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,600
Stop pushing!

239
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,340
The car is broken

240
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,380
It's no use pushing it

241
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,740
You call to ask

242
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,160
when can the rescue arrive

243
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,730
I have to arrive the destination today

244
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,360
I've called already

245
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,420
This road is so far-off

246
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,150
It'll take time for the rescue car to come over

247
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,810
What to do with that?

248
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,620
How about this?

249
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,770
You go along this road first

250
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,110
After my car is well repaired,

251
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,740
I'll come to you and drive you to the destination

252
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:45,840
You can believe

253
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,840
I'm a taxi driver

254
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,810
with professional ethics

255
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:52,200
I trust you

256
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,360
Help me take out my belongings

257
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,240
Come on. Excuse me!

258
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,280
Sit down

259
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,550
It's still far away

260
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,910
Come and get me!

261
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,070
Slow down. Don't fall down!

262
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:47,380
Run slowly. Don't fall down!

263
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:49,320
You cannot get me

264
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,100
Who's it?

265
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,020
Goat

266
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,630
Yan

267
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,200
Hello, uncle

268
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:01,890
This

269
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,410
A little gift

270
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,280
to show my respect to you

271
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,270
Yan Jingzhi

272
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,200
Which patient

273
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,760
made Dr. Han angry?

274
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,700
Mom!

275
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,710
Why are you here?

276
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:59,160
I came to deliver something to your father

277
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,110
and drop by to see you

278
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,260
What's the matter?

279
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,410
Are you in bad mood?

280
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:06,720
I'm fine

281
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,970
It's just problems at work

282
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,560
How come I didn't see Xinxin come over recently?

283
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,330
Did you break up?

284
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,570
What?

285
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,020
Mom, would you like something to drink?

286
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,290
Now I'm not in the mood to drink anything

287
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,520
Tell me about it!

288
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,290
For what?

289
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,710
Why did you break up?

290
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:31,000
She isn't a fan of mine anymore

291
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:33,990
What?

292
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,330
It's just that she doesn't like me

293
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,500
You're talking nonsense again

294
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,190
You almost gave me a heart attack!

295
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,240
Do you know that?

296
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,650
What I said is true

297
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,090
What's true or not?

298
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,840
How can Xinxin dislike you,

299
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,500
right?

300
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,510
Son, do you forget that

301
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:54,980
she was gazing at you

302
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:57,790
when we had dinner together last time?

303
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:59,710
She regarded me as her idol

304
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:04,640
Xinxin is really like me

305
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,690
When I was young,

306
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,460
I regarded your father as my idol

307
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,400
But a single person can have many idols

308
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,970
You silly child

309
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:15,990
Let me tell you something

310
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,490
Idolization

311
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,920
and reality

312
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:20,170
are different things

313
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,780
You didn't misunderstand Xinxin, did you?

314
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:26,660
I'm telling you

315
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,320
You should cherish

316
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,390
such a good girl like Xinxin

317
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,620
If she falls in love with others,

318
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,670
you'll cry

319
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,030
If it because you misunderstood her,

320
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,580
I cannot forgive you

321
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:51,120
Take care, mom

322
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,020
Is it all right?

323
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,820
It's inappropriate, isn't it?

324
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:26,550
My father's clothes fit you well

325
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:27,890
Where are my clothes?

326
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:30,050
I washed them and haven't dried yet

327
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,040
You just make do with it!

328
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,270
I'll buy you a suitable suit tomorrow

329
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:41,240
Don't you ask me why I came here?

330
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:50,650
It's late today

331
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,910
I'll hail a taxi to take you back tomorrow

332
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,300
Let's go

333
00:20:54,710 --> 00:20:55,890
My mom cooked you noodles

334
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,900
Aunt,

335
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,300
This uncle who sent us a goat

336
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,010
Why do you look like you haven't eaten anything?

337
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,620
Go! Go! Go!

338
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:19,220
Let's go inside to watch cartoons

339
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,410
Let's go!

340
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:21,940
Eat slowly. Yan

341
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,030
There's still more!

342
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,060
Come on! Come on!

343
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:24,760
Thank you, aunt

344
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,810
I didn't eat so much before

345
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,070
The noodles you made is so delicious

346
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:28,880
really

347
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,270
You seem to have good fortune as you eat

348
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:34,510
Thanks

349
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,460
I can make more if you like

350
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,230
OK! Thank you, aunt

351
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:38,390
I'm fine

352
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,000
What I want to say is

353
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:41,220
why didn't you call in advance

354
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,260
before you came here?

355
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:45,530
It was like this

356
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,780
I came on business in Shashi

357
00:21:46,870 --> 00:21:47,910
And I dropped by here

358
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,540
Dropped by?

359
00:21:50,570 --> 00:21:53,410
It's uneasy to drop by here

360
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:56,890
Yan

361
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,170
You have to make do with sleeping overnight,

362
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,980
because we have so many guest rooms in my house

363
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,990
Maybe you need to

364
00:22:02,010 --> 00:22:03,380
share a room with Xingxing's bother tonight

365
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:04,500
Is that alright for you?

366
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,480
I was too abrupt

367
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,500
and troubled you

368
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,010
No! No!

369
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:13,550
Continue eating!

370
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,340
Have more

371
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:18,960
Why will you live here if you know to trouble us?

372
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:21,610
That...

373
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:22,850
I'm full

374
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,100
I'll clean it up

375
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:32,880
What are you doing?

376
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,220
Did Yan offend you?

377
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,690
Why did you gruff like that?

378
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,560
Stop saying Yan

379
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,950
He's Mr. Yan

380
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,160
You didn't have a fever

381
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,650
Why do you say things strangely?

382
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,680
What are you doing?

383
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:20,810
Uncle,

384
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,900
I'm too full

385
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,310
I stand here for a while

386
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:25,910
You're too full to do anything, right?

387
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,490
If you have nothing to do, wash the dishes!

388
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:28,430
Dad

389
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:29,500
Don't call me dad!

390
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,340
Right!

391
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,050
Mr. Yan has cleanliness and obsessive-compulsive disorder, right?

392
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,660
Exactly!

393
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,240
Don't bother

394
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,460
I'll finish washing in minutes

395
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,330
Do you have gloves?

396
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,490
We're in the countryside

397
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,690
We don't be particular about this

398
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,580
If you cannot wash these...

399
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,200
I can

400
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,530
Let me do this

401
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:24,930
Xingxing,

402
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,220
change a pot of tea for me!

403
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:28,820
Dad

404
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,960
Dad, you...

405
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,970
Dad, the tea has been changes already

406
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:44,620
Okay

407
00:24:51,870 --> 00:24:52,480
Xingxing,

408
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,110
Massage my shoulder!

409
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,150
It seems that I had a stiff neck last night

410
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,530
Okay

411
00:25:16,590 --> 00:25:17,130
Xingxing,

412
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,840
Don't touch!

413
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:31,970
I'll clean it up. Sor...Sorry!

414
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,890
My...my hands were slippery

415
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:33,230
Don't touch

416
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,170
This was newly bought by me

417
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:42,120
But it was broken by you

418
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:43,840
I will pay

419
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,200
Mr. Yan,

420
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,500
money isn't everything,

421
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:50,880
at least cannot make up for emotional damage

422
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,270
Come on

423
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,850
You just go back to your room

424
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,680
I'll let Xingxing clean it up

425
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,850
If you continue washing,

426
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,420
we won't eat with plates tomorrow

427
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:08,180
I'm so sorry!

428
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:16,170
Don't clean it up with bare hands!

429
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,320
Don't you ask

430
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:37,880
why I came?

431
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:55,690
Yan...

432
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,350
Yan Jingzhi, are you insane?

433
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,250
I searched all over Jinghai, but I couldn't find you

434
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,470
I was almost going crazy

435
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:05,360
I called you and you didn't answer

436
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:06,540
I texted you and you didn't reply

437
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,440
Why are you so heartless?

438
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,330
I told you not to come to me

439
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,980
I remember what happened five years ago

440
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:26,740
It doesn't has nothing to do with me

441
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:28,820
How could it be?

442
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,300
The one I liked five years ago,

443
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:30,800
I like now

444
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,770
and I'll like will be you only

445
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,250
Xingchen,

446
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,010
come back to me, okay?

447
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,560
Can you promise

448
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,720
you won't lose memory?

449
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,230
I cannot

450
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:01,800
But

451
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,730
I figured out one thing

452
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
during the period when you weren't with me

453
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:07,650
What's that?

454
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,480
I want to make you happy

455
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:12,320
But I overlooked one thing that

456
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,970
I'm the only one who can make you happy

457
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,020
as you do to me

458
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:19,800
But

459
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,590
aren't you afraid to forget me again?

460
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,020
It's still the smell of rosemary on you

461
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,820
In the ancient times,

462
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,040
people thought rosemary could help increase memory

463
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,160
So

464
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,670
when sailors got lost at sea,

465
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:43,400
they could find the land by tracing the fragrance of flowers

466
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:47,030
Thus, rosemary is also known as the lighthouse on the sea

467
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:48,760
Xingchen,

468
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,520
You're the lighthouse of mine

469
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,110
My Polaris

470
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:54,310
As long as you're by my side,

471
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,940
I'll never get lost

472
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:28,920
Dad

473
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,350
Xingxing,

474
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,510
I saw the light in your room is still on

475
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:34,400
and I wanted to see why you're still up

476
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,570
I cannot sleep

477
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,620
and I'm reading

478
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,520
Is it related to Yan Jingzhi?

479
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,210
No! Dad

480
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,490
Don't overthink!

481
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,700
Xingxing,

482
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,400
I don't want to interfere in your love

483
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,420
But Yan Jingzhi

484
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,080
doesn't match you

485
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,510
What's wrong? Dad

486
00:30:59,070 --> 00:31:01,380
Didn't you get along well with him last time?

487
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,440
He was with the identity of boss last time

488
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:06,760
But he chased you here now

489
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:09,210
I cannot play dumb even I understand

490
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:11,240
Your mother is careless

491
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:12,330
and didn't find

492
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:13,860
But I saw through it

493
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,640
that you came back

494
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,960
in a bad mood this time

495
00:31:17,810 --> 00:31:19,000
Was it related to him?

496
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:21,540
Dad just hope

497
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,510
you can find a man

498
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,200
who is well-matched in social and economic status with you

499
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,190
and good to you

500
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,300
As the old saying goes: "trouble always arises out of the wealthy families."

501
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:32,130
Yan Jingzhi is so picky in life

502
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:33,810
We cannot know

503
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:35,330
how hard are his families to get along with in the future

504
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,550
If you're with him,

505
00:31:38,990 --> 00:31:41,190
I'm worried that you'll be wronged

506
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:42,950
That couldn't happen, dad

507
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,730
I've seen his mother

508
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,710
She was nice

509
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:46,900
You have

510
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,410
seen his parents?

511
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:51,620
I'm warning you

512
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,700
You cannot learn from the young girls in the TV series

513
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,200
that get married outside secretly

514
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,130
If you dare to do that,

515
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:56,560
I...

516
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:58,170
I'll end the father-daughter relationship with you

517
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,000
Dad, what are you talking about?

518
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,830
I'll call my mom if you continue to do this

519
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,060
Mom!

520
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,040
No! No! No!

521
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:04,750
Okay! Okay! Okay!

522
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:05,620
I'm leaving

523
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,790
But keep my words in mind!

524
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:09,390
Yes Keep that in mind!

525
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,420
Alright! Alright! I'm sleeping!

526
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,550
It's late. Go to bed!

527
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,310
Don't touch me

528
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:21,730
All right

529
00:32:22,330 --> 00:32:23,220
Good night!

530
00:32:39,430 --> 00:32:39,970
You can come out

531
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:45,370
What's the matter?

532
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,800
Is it uncomfortable for you stayed there for a long time?

533
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,900
I thought a profound friendship has been established

534
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,960
between uncle and I when we drank together last time

535
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,710
It turned out to be that he still doesn't like me

536
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,020
It doesn't matter whether he likes you or not

537
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:02,340
What matters most is me

538
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,730
What do you think?

539
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,110
It's late. Don't you go back to your room?

540
00:33:07,180 --> 00:33:08,430
You'll return the city tomorrow

541
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,450
If uncle and aunt don't agree,

542
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,390
I won't go

543
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,160
What about the company?

544
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:15,330
If you're worried about that the company will close down,

545
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,370
you can help me to convince them

546
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,770
I haven't promised to be with you again

547
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:25,780
That's alright

548
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,090
I'll fight for it!

549
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:34,840
Come on!

550
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:52,030
My old lady

551
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,550
I want to ask you something

552
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:54,820
What?

553
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,480
Where is the household registration book of Xingxing?

554
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,360
Household registration?

555
00:34:00,970 --> 00:34:01,710
Did you forget that

556
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:02,720
she transferred to

557
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,750
Jinghai when she was in college?

558
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:06,290
What's the matter?

559
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,390
It's okay! It's okay!

560
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:09,360
I forgot! I forgot!

561
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:10,880
You're nerve-racking

562
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,340
and scared me a lot

563
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,410
How is it going?

564
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,470
Have you found Xingchen?

565
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,600
Zhao Yuanfang, you betrayed me!

566
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,200
Madame! Madame!

567
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,550
I'm wrong! I'm wrong!

568
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,220
I'll offer a humble apology when you return Jinghai

569
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,040
It's late now

570
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:51,070
You just go to bed and get a beauty sleep, which is good for your skin

571
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:51,440
Good night

572
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,790
He finally found her

573
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,130
He's quiet efficient!

574
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,770
The angry woman is horrible

575
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:31,550
It's the 30th day after Xingchen left

576
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,290
I still miss her so much

577
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,650
Missing her is the most important thing for me every single day

578
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,990
It's the first day when Xingchen left

579
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:56,200
I thought I wouldn't miss her if

580
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:57,650
I had a full schedule

581
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,240
But I' was wrong

582
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,410
I would miss her when I ate

583
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,220
when I walked

584
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,070
and when I drove

585
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:11,360
I've turned loving her into an instinct

586
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:29,830
Another glass of liquor

587
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,880
Another glass of liquor!

588
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,140
Sorry, it'll be ready

589
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,190
What are you looking for?

590
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:41,420
The photos of Zhen Nian before the cosmetic surgery

591
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:42,720
It is simply too exaggerated!

592
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,580
It turns out that she's a cosmetic freak

593
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:51,950
I still liked her!

594
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:56,580
Your love is really cheap

595
00:36:57,130 --> 00:36:58,070
Whatever she looks like,

596
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,750
she's good-looking

597
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,510
than you guys do

598
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,010
Why are you frozen?

599
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:02,860
Get me the liquor!

600
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,820
This time

601
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,390
you'll come to me on your own, won't you?

602
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,870
Come on. Doudou,

603
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:20,960
eat eggs

604
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:22,020
You cannot refuse to eat

605
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:22,620
I don't like it?

606
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:23,660
Good morning, granny

607
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,110
Morning! Morning!

608
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,090
Granny, I also want to eat eggs

609
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,580
Okay! Eat eggs! Eat eggs!

610
00:37:28,630 --> 00:37:29,580
Thank you, granny

611
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:30,390
Mom!

612
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:31,980
Xingxing,

613
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,660
you eyes look red

614
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:36,770
Did you cry last night?

615
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:37,990
I didn't

616
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,090
I slept late

617
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:40,350
Maybe it's a little swollen

618
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,900
Did that boy bully you again?

619
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,530
Dad, can you stop talking nonsense?

620
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,150
Yan

621
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:48,170
Good morning! Aunt

622
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:48,480
Morning

623
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:49,390
You get up already

624
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,880
I'll serve you breakfast

625
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:51,560
Thank you, aunt

626
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:52,710
Good morning, uncle

627
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:56,020
Grandma

628
00:37:56,690 --> 00:37:57,390
Good morning, granny

629
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:00,600
Grandma has a poor hearing

630
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,920
Hello, grandma

631
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,280
My name is Yan Jingzhi

632
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:05,880
It was too late last night

633
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,480
to say hello to you

634
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,110
Sorry for disturbing you these days

635
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,570
Alright

636
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:14,050
Come on. Eat an egg! Eat an egg!

637
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,460
Thank you, granny

638
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,360
You disturbed my ears

639
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,070
Sorry, uncle

640
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,350
Last time when you was in Jinghai,

641
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,460
I didn't have time to introduce myself seriously

642
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,480
My name is Yan Jingzhi

643
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,360
I'm twenty nine years old,

644
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,310
188cm tall

645
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,420
75 kg,

646
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,820
and have no bad habits

647
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:34,120
I'm the president in the company

648
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,550
My IQ is 151

649
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,210
I'm also a member of Mensa Club

650
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,670
What? What? Men...Men...Mensa?

651
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:46,920
It's just the top IQ club in the world

652
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,460
Yan

653
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,500
You're so excellent

654
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:57,030
I like you so much!

655
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,000
Thank you, aunt

656
00:38:58,900 --> 00:38:59,550
Come on

657
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:00,440
Here you are

658
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,480
Eat an egg

659
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:02,830
Thanks, Mom

660
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:03,620
No

661
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,810
Thank you, aunt

662
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,240
Mr. Yan

663
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,390
Now that your IQ is over 150

664
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,340
Can you catch chickens?

665
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:16,730
What?

666
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,630
Why do you embarrass Yan?

667
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:37,240
He bragged about his high IQ, didn't he?

668
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,020
If he cannot catch a chicken,

669
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:43,060
what universe the top IQ club he belongs to!

670
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,040
I just...

671
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,550
You're being childish! You see

672
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:55,390
Yes! Yes! Yes! There! There!

673
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,020
Xingxing,

674
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:58,130
Come back!

675
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,940
Come on and get it! Come on!

676
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,540
This side, this...

677
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:08,600
That one!

678
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,920
Yes! That one! That one!

679
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:16,060
Just that one!

680
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:20,950
Got it!

681
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,140
Got it!

682
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,740
Alright! Alright! Alright! Alright!

683
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:27,620
What the hell!

684
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:28,890
Did he catch it? Go! Go! Go!

685
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:29,440
He really...

686
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,120
How to handle this?

687
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,810
Give it to me!

688
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,410
It isn't a cosmetic surgery

689
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,210
but a change of head

690
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,290
I still liked her so much

691
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,670
She was kind of hardcore before face-lifting

692
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,160
It's kind of fraud on fans, right?

693
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:45,430
I really hate her

694
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,170
Silica gel face and face-lifting freak!

695
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:47,970
She's such a liar!

696
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,530
We got it!

697
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,060
It was your college classmate Zhou Weiwei

698
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:56,760
sold all your photos to entertainment reporters

699
00:40:58,290 --> 00:40:59,910
How could it be her?

700
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,280
She asked you for a favor, didn't she?

701
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,400
I heard that she offended Yan Jingzhi

702
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:08,070
Her boyfriend was demoted and broke up with her

703
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,630
Maybe she did this out of revenge

704
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:14,890
Are you alright?

705
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:19,240
How many brands have proposed rescission?

706
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,540
Almost all of them

707
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:25,280
Niannian

708
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,440
I think you should ask Mr. Yan for help

709
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:28,460
Mr. Zhao is also okay

710
00:41:28,930 --> 00:41:30,200
I heard his father is quiet famous

711
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,240
in the field of media

712
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:33,610
My own business

713
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,760
I can solve it by myself

714
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:35,950
Niannian

715
00:41:36,550 --> 00:41:37,800
I have to face it, don't I?

716
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:40,280
I'm leaving first

717
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,800
Come on! Come on! Come on! Zhen Nian

718
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,270
Grandma

719
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,560
Say something, mom! Granny!

720
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,660
Mom, are you okay?

721
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,600
What's wrong with granny?

722
00:42:25,050 --> 00:42:26,460
She fell down from upstairs

723
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:27,900
Did you call a taxi?

724
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,760
Yes, we did!

725
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,700
It'll be here soon!

726
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,280
Don't move! Grandma

727
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,720
If it's insufficient blood supply to the brain

728
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,980
bone dislocation,

729
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,240
the illness will be aggravated by doing this

730
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:36,590
What to do with that?

731
00:42:37,710 --> 00:42:38,380
Grandma

732
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,070
Can you hear me?

733
00:42:42,230 --> 00:42:43,520
Yes, I can

734
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,420
Fortunately

735
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,500
She has clear awareness

736
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:46,900
Grandma

737
00:42:47,130 --> 00:42:49,180
Do you feel angina?

738
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:51,420
No, no!

739
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,610
What's wrong with her?

740
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:06,430
It seems not good

741
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:08,200
Maybe a bone dislocation

742
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:09,250
Brother,

743
00:43:09,450 --> 00:43:10,780
can you find a bed board?

744
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:11,500
OK!

745
00:43:11,870 --> 00:43:12,260
Xingchen,

746
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:13,120
Get two bath towels

747
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:14,040
Hi, aunt

748
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:15,060
You call the taxi ready!

749
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:15,780
OK! OK! OK!

750
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:16,220
Uncle,

751
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,360
you lay that leg flat slowly

752
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:19,050
Okay

753
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,000
Mom!

754
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,500
Be patient, grandma

755
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:24,310
Don't be afraid!

756
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,110
Relax!

757
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:25,530
Okay

758
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:26,750
The doctor will be here right now!

759
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:27,380
Don't be afraid!

760
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:28,150
We're all here

761
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:29,810
The doctor will be here right now!

762
00:43:30,170 --> 00:43:30,970
Here comes the bed board

763
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,440
Okay, hurry! Hurry!

764
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:33,430
Slow down

765
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,100
Lay it flat!

766
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:36,160
Like this,

767
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:36,650
Brother,

768
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:37,960
you lift grandma's feet

769
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:39,090
Uncle,

770
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,100
and you hold her waist

771
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:40,490
Okay

772
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:41,240
I'll count to one two three

773
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,160
and we lay grandma on it

774
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:43,110
Okay

775
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:44,750
One, two, three

776
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,090
Slow down! Slow down!

777
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,120
Here comes the bath towel

778
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:50,320
Come on! Okay!

779
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,320
Here comes the taxi!

780
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,380
Here comes the taxi!

781
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:54,380
Okay

782
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,350
Lift it right now! Quickly!

783
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:55,710
Okay

784
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,700
One, two, three, go!

785
00:43:58,810 --> 00:43:59,550
Put it flat!

786
00:43:59,630 --> 00:44:00,440
Be careful! Slow down

787
00:44:00,460 --> 00:44:01,030
Slow down

788
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,250
Lay it flat!

789
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:03,240
You'll be fine, grandma

790
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:10,980
Doctor,

791
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:11,750
I...

792
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,500
How's my mother's situation?

793
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,720
She has a cervical fracture

794
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:16,700
Fortunately, you didn't make her move deliberately

795
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:17,690
and took emergency measures

796
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,800
So the illness wasn't aggravated

797
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:21,330
Have a good rest later

798
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:22,190
There should be no big problem

799
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:24,240
Thank you, doctor

800
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,490
Thanks. You're welcome. Thanks

801
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,150
Yan

802
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:38,200
Thank you this time

803
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:40,440
for providing such a good

804
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:42,790
doctors and medical environment

805
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:44,040
Don't say that, uncle

806
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:45,950
I've arranged suitable doctors for

807
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:47,110
subsequent treatment and recuperation

808
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:48,430
You don't need to worry about it

809
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:50,650
Okay

810
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:51,770
Yan

811
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,840
How can you know first-aid measures?

812
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,080
I took relevant courses when I was at school

813
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,620
No wonder!

814
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,870
You're versatile! You're versatile!

815
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:05,500
Then, then I'll ask the doctor again

816
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:07,240
about the situation later

817
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:07,850
OK! OK! OK!

818
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:09,350
That'll be just right

819
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,580
I'll go back to get something to use

820
00:45:10,810 --> 00:45:11,930
You two take good care of grandma!

821
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:12,550
Okay! Okay!

822
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:15,820
Mom, take care

823
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:16,730
Don't worry!

824
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:28,850
Thank you

825
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:30,180
Never mind

826
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:32,090
Your family is also mine

827
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:34,800
I'll protect them like

828
00:45:35,310 --> 00:45:36,210
I do to you

829
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:01,250
Come on. Here it is!

830
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:02,770
You'll be there by going further

831
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:04,340
I'll go this way

832
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:06,810
Thank you, brother

833
00:46:06,990 --> 00:46:07,920
You're welcome

834
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:08,580
How much?

835
00:46:08,670 --> 00:46:09,760
What money?

836
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:10,520
No! No!

837
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,080
Then this...

838
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,020
this is for you

839
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,830
as a souvenir to stop the wind

840
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:17,080
Okay! Thank you! It's good!

841
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:18,600
You really have professional ethics

842
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:28,330
Brother, is there any supermarket in the village?

843
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:29,510
There is no supermarket in the village

844
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,390
but canteen only

845
00:46:30,870 --> 00:46:32,720
Are you going to visit relatives?

846
00:46:32,860 --> 00:46:34,350
I'm going to my girlfriend's

847
00:46:34,570 --> 00:46:36,550
That's a proposal?

848
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,410
We don't propose with this here

849
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:40,090
Then what should I go with?

850
00:46:44,380 --> 00:46:44,850
I'm leaving

851
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:47,980
Go!
