1
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:41,980
Mr. Nie

2
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,030
Why are you here?

3
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,460
It's you!

4
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,580
Didn't the problem be solved?

5
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,300
Why do you have a frown on your face?

6
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:51,940
But...

7
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:53,080
You're successful now

8
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,200
and have a wealthy son-in-law

9
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,580
It's reasonable for you to dislike me

10
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,090
What wealthy son-in-law?

11
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,760
Don't talk nonsense!

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,110
This is a good thing

13
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:05,310
Don't hide it!

14
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,170
Are you afraid that I'll borrow money from you?

15
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:09,720
My daughter hasn't married yet!

16
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:11,100
How can I get a son-in-law?

17
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,710
The one million you guaranteed for me last time

18
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,760
was paid by your son-in-law

19
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,280
What?

20
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,220
Dad

21
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,240
Uncle,

22
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:32,560
Yan

23
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,880
You come out, I have a word with you

24
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:35,800
Okay

25
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,340
Yan, have a seat

26
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:02,120
Uncle,

27
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,530
do you have something to tell?

28
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,690
Do you really like

29
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:11,460
Xingxing?

30
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,390
Sure!

31
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,750
It's the luckiest thing ever for me

32
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:16,920
to meet with her

33
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:21,090
Don't you think there's a

34
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,190
big gap between my family and yours?

35
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,210
But you don't need to worry

36
00:03:28,170 --> 00:03:28,960
Then one million yuan...

37
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:30,290
I'll definitely pay it to you

38
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,610
Uncle, don't misunderstand

39
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:34,840
Actually,

40
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:38,030
Xingchen's first love

41
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:38,730
was just me five years ago

42
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,000
We loved each other very much five years ago

43
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,930
Later, I got a disease

44
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,400
and forgot her totally

45
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,580
She waited for me for five years

46
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:49,900
and I'd been looking for her for five years

47
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,760
Now I remember everything

48
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:53,800
Anything

49
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,800
cannot separate us

50
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,600
Forget it

51
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,870
I cannot figure it out

52
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,360
what happen between you two

53
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:16,240
But if you dare to bully Xingxing,

54
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:18,460
I'll never forgive you

55
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,620
Don't worry, uncle

56
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,240
I won't definitely let you down

57
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,240
This hotel has an agreement with my dad

58
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:35,270
Here's very strict security

59
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,820
You

60
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,050
just rest here confidently

61
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:39,860
Don't worry!

62
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:42,550
No one will leak the news

63
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,090
Don't you have any question to ask me?

64
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,060
You have the final say about your life

65
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:50,930
As long as you don't hurt others,

66
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,250
no one is qualified to judge you

67
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,150
Take a good rest!

68
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,710
I'll deal with what happens on the internet

69
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,640
You don't have to

70
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:01,920
I'll handle it by myself

71
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,370
Why are you so stubborn?

72
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:08,690
Don't you know to take the initiative to come to me?

73
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:11,620
Then do you like it?

74
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,300
You guess

75
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,670
You were willing to ward off eggs for me

76
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,190
I guess you like me insanely

77
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:22,630
Well how about you?

78
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,620
I'll pay you back

79
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,270
What money?

80
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:56,730
That my dad guaranteed for another one before

81
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:58,200
I just found out today

82
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,370
that you paid it back for him

83
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,260
We're a family

84
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,480
Why do we distinguish this so clearly?

85
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,000
You don't need me to return it

86
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:09,330
OK!

87
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,080
I'd like to say that you can deduct from my salary

88
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,530
What did you say?

89
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:17,990
You said you'd go back

90
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,740
as long as my parents accept you

91
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:19,220
What?

92
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,330
Stay here for a lifetime?

93
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,520
Director Huang will scold you harshly if you don't go back

94
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,090
I'm going to faint

95
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,980
Put me down

96
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,830
Dr. Han

97
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,670
You're back

98
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,750
You came alone?

99
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,620
I have something to ask you,

100
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,080
so I didn't tell him

101
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,150
You want to ask about his illness?

102
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:12,320
I want to ask

103
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,020
if he's cured totally

104
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,260
If it's an illness

105
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,800
caused by physical damage,

106
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,270
it can be cured

107
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:22,220
by surgery and fine recovery

108
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,320
But the psychological harm caused by

109
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,580
the change of emotion

110
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,620
can confirm

111
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,070
by time

112
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,500
So he...

113
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,850
It's still possible that he'll forget me

114
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:42,700
Well...

115
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:45,470
I really cannot give the definite answer

116
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,150
You...

117
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,690
Won't you give up Jingzhi?

118
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,060
A project with low risk

119
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,760
and return of investment

120
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:03,180
and one with high risk

121
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,870
and return of investment

122
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,100
Which one will you choose?

123
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,920
As a doctor,

124
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,580
I usually choose for patients the low-risk

125
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,300
and relative guaranteed program

126
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,420
But from the perspective of my profession,

127
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,590
higher risk means greater profit

128
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,040
This is the value at risk

129
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,760
So you don't have to worry about it

130
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,250
I won't give up this time

131
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:24,670
I want to make a bet

132
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:51,340
Secretary Nie,

133
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,640
you aren't at home as expected

134
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,600
The first day of your return,

135
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,840
you dare to skip work

136
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,240
You're getting bolder and bolder now

137
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,060
Can I go back to the company in a few days?

138
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:02,170
At least I need to say hello

139
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,140
to the colleagues of PO

140
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,120
Or I feel embarrassed to face them

141
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,560
Then you can let me go to work alone?

142
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,210
Dear Mr. Yan

143
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:13,370
You'll be late if you don't go now

144
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,100
See you this evening

145
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,280
Okay

146
00:09:18,610 --> 00:09:19,210
See you this evening

147
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,440
Each woman has the right to pursue beauty

148
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,050
and I'm not an exception

149
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,050
As long as I don't hurt anybody,

150
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,050
I think

151
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:13,140
you have no reason to criticize me

152
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:15,530
Because all my achievements

153
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,170
were gained by my hard work

154
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,690
but by my appearance solely

155
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,450
Maybe you cannot accept this

156
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:23,480
But it doesn't matter

157
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:25,040
My own life

158
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:26,400
I'm responsible for it

159
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,740
You're really my girlfriend

160
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,420
You truly have a great personality

161
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,340
Holding live broadcast of the press conference

162
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,080
in the coffee shop in the hotel lobby

163
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,370
Miss Zhen has become the first person in the entertainment industry

164
00:11:09,950 --> 00:11:11,260
It both saves human resources

165
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,070
and is low-carbon and eco-friendly

166
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,390
Isn't it very good?

167
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,330
Miss Zhen,

168
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,200
you haven't answered my question I asked yesterday

169
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,600
What question?

170
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:37,400
Are you inviting me to be your girlfriend?

171
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,230
Miss Zhen,

172
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,230
I want you to be responsible for me

173
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,330
So

174
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,870
wish us a happy cooperation!

175
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,270
Happy cooperation!

176
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,870
Is the party fun?

177
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,510
When will it end?

178
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,550
I'll pick you up

179
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:25,050
You don't answer the message!

180
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,110
It's just a little case

181
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,050
I can handle this

182
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,880
To protect our love

183
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:38,620
The footprint you left in our memories

184
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,760
Turn it off! Turn it off!

185
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,030
Let me tell you!

186
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:53,690
I'm so happy!

187
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,070
I haven't been so happy for a long time

188
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:57,740
Secretary Nie

189
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:59,250
Since you left,

190
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,200
I've been concerning about these guys

191
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,300
If something was wrong at work,

192
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:04,440
I'm afraid our boss would be in bad mood

193
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,340
You see my gray hair?

194
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,260
Layer by layer

195
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,140
You see my folds

196
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:09,240
They fold one by one

197
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,920
But I'm happy today

198
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,790
Didn't our boss praise you today?

199
00:14:13,930 --> 00:14:15,800
That shows everyone here did a good job

200
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,700
To infer from my sixth sense of a man,

201
00:14:18,910 --> 00:14:20,450
our boss's turning in good mood suddenly

202
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,190
must be related to woman

203
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:22,960
That's impossible!

204
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,600
We dug up the news about him

205
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,610
There's only a woman Zhen Nian around Mr. Yan

206
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,530
Think about it. After the news that Zhen Nian face-lifted was released,

207
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,360
she hid herself

208
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,480
Do you think if it's a coincidence?

209
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,240
Mr. Yan just suddenly disappeared

210
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:37,720
I cannot believe there's no relationship between them

211
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,030
Lulu

212
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,940
Zhen Nian. What did you say about her?

213
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,930
Has your home been disconnected from the internet?

214
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,050
Sister Xingchen

215
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,480
Don't you know about it?

216
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:47,670
See

217
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,620
I really envy Zhen Nian

218
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,580
that she has such boyfriend who cares about her

219
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:55,050
and never gives up on her

220
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,060
All right! All right! All right!

221
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:57,890
Stop talking about this!

222
00:14:57,950 --> 00:14:58,650
How about

223
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:00,430
we propose a toast

224
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,120
to our boss and Miss Zhen

225
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,270
Wish they have a smooth and happy relationship

226
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,480
We can also benefit from that, right?

227
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,380
Yes! Yes! Yes!

228
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:06,960
Yes!

229
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,610
Cheers! Come on!

230
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,390
It turns out that you're very concerned about my personal life!

231
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:15,440
Hi

232
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,060
Here you are!

233
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,220
I forgot to tell about one thing

234
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,010
Then you can say after you sit down

235
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:21,650
Take a seat!

236
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,170
I'd better stand

237
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,110
The post of my Chief Secretary has been vacant for a long time

238
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,620
I've finished the work

239
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:31,290
You see

240
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:33,370
this one graduated from Cambridge University

241
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:34,760
She just graduated

242
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,360
and has no work experience

243
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,220
She's not fit to be, is she?

244
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:38,780
Then you can see this one

245
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,630
She's a secretary from the world's top 500

246
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,250
She's already 36 and unmarried

247
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:44,460
Is she prepared to get married and give birth during the period she works?

248
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,920
Will it affect the work?

249
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,200
Er...I didn't ask her about giving birth

250
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,960
Looking for a secretary is like playing a game

251
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,440
It's so difficult to find a hero that

252
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,010
suits you best

253
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,430
That's right!

254
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,710
You know that Mr. Yan

255
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,810
just find

256
00:15:59,810 --> 00:16:00,510
Secretary Nie

257
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,370
Secretary Nie,

258
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,930
have you found any job

259
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,470
when you returned Jinghai?

260
00:16:13,060 --> 00:16:14,090
Not yet

261
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,170
Mr. Yan is looking for a General Secretary

262
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:18,590
And you're looking for a job

263
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:19,990
Does this make us all

264
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,440
get together again?

265
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,950
It's the fate of God that guides you

266
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,170
to go back

267
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,170
Yes!

268
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,450
Sister Xingchen

269
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:30,330
Come back to our arms!

270
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,230
Secretary Nie should be very clear that

271
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,500
I never give others a second chance

272
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,540
You've resigned for several times

273
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,500
I've been lenient

274
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,300
Secretary Nie,

275
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,030
Mr. Yan is waiting for your reply

276
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:44,590
Xingchen,

277
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,980
Don't be silly again this time

278
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:48,460
It's just an end of a relationship

279
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:50,280
Don't ruin your career

280
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,900
for this love rat

281
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,570
Exactly

282
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,410
Sister Xingchen is

283
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,940
a woman Mr. Yan cannot live without

284
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,350
That man doesn't know to cherish her

285
00:16:58,970 --> 00:16:59,490
Sister Xingchen

286
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:01,010
Let's find another one

287
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,210
who's much better than him

288
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,520
Just forget the love rat

289
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:04,580
Let's drink! Xinxin

290
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,160
Exactly

291
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,220
Just forget the love rat

292
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:08,600
Mr. Yan

293
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,440
Please give me another chance

294
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,890
I'll be devoted in serving the company

295
00:17:13,070 --> 00:17:14,610
Is the brand the only thing

296
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:15,960
that attracts you to a company

297
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:19,720
Absolutely not!

298
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:22,730
And because of your ability as a leader

299
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:29,370
Come on

300
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:38,410
Then I look forward to working with Secretary Nie

301
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,770
Thanks for your support and attention

302
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:44,670
Okay

303
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,640
Welcome back

304
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,310
Welcome! Welcome!

305
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,180
Okay! Come on

306
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,940
Cheers! Cheers! Come on! Cheers! Cheers!

307
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,350
Welcome back!

308
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,360
Tong Xin and I called a designated driver

309
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,550
How do you go home?

310
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,290
We...We...

311
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,730
We, we go together

312
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,170
Then you go with me

313
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:00,460
Okay! Okay! Okay!

314
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:00,940
I go with you

315
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,040
Secretary Nie, how do you get home?

316
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:02,850
She goes with me

317
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,680
Bye-bye!

318
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,390
Miss Nie

319
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,040
May I ask, Miss Nie

320
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:09,890
Who are these people?

321
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,790
Can you talk about the relationship

322
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:12,390
between you and Zhao Yuanfang?

323
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,400
Do you have any feelings

324
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,410
when you saw the love photos of Zhao Yuanfang and Zhen Nian?

325
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,780
Love?

326
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,690
You can just ask the

327
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:19,980
person concerned if you have any questions

328
00:18:20,150 --> 00:18:21,330
We refuse to answer any question

329
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:22,990
Is Zhen Nian

330
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,510
the third wheel between you and Zhao Yuanfang?

331
00:18:26,430 --> 00:18:28,760
Zhao Yuanfang and I are colleagues and friends

332
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:29,750
That's it

333
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:31,170
One of staff from Yuan Da said

334
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,510
that you're Mrs. Yan

335
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,820
A few female friends around Mr. Zhao

336
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,300
also confirmed your identity as his fiancee

337
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:36,730
How do you explain this?

338
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,270
The plot is a little bit disorderly

339
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:40,970
It turns out Mr. Zhao is the love rat

340
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:43,100
Is Zhen Nian with our boss?

341
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,020
Let's just wait and see

342
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,000
I... I and...

343
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:50,940
Anyway, I...

344
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:52,660
This is the first time

345
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,270
and also the last time to state in public

346
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,690
Since I knew Nie Xingchen six years ago,

347
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,390
she has me only as her boyfriend

348
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,020
Zhen Nian and Zhao Yuanfang

349
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:00,840
We're just friends

350
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,810
There's no any third wheel in our relationship

351
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:06,040
I remember all the medias present today

352
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,060
I hope everyone of you can report it truthfully

353
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,130
Thank you

354
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,090
Excuse me!

355
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,560
Exclusive

356
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:17,530
Just go to press!

357
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:22,850
So

358
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:26,160
Sister Xingchen is with our boss

359
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:29,390
Our boss was so gentle just now

360
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,660
No! No!

361
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,320
Did I ridicule

362
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,890
the ex-boyfriend of Xingchen doesn't know

363
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:35,450
to cherish

364
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,600
That isn't a big deal!

365
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,720
Did I say

366
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,620
our boss is a love rat?

367
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,970
It's screwed! Screwed! Screwed!

368
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:45,490
I told you not to gossip like this

369
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:46,470
Don't gossip!

370
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,410
You don't listen anyway

371
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,430
Anyway I said nothing

372
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:51,030
Me too!

373
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,460
It's lucky to gossip about our boss

374
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:55,470
And it's just half a month's salary will be deducted

375
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:00,960
I drank before, right?

376
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,040
Yeah! I feel a little dizzy

377
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,670
What on earth is matter?

378
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,430
It isn't Mr. Zhao

379
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,250
No, no. There're so many episodes of their stories now

380
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,910
I won't be as an intern again, will I?

381
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:10,670
What's the matter?

382
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,830
Sorry, the number you've dialed cannot be connected for the moment

383
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,750
Why hasn't Zhao Yuanfang answered the phone?

384
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:19,780
How about Zhen Nian?

385
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,990
She didn't answer either

386
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,740
Do you know

387
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,040
Zhen Nian was my college classmate?

388
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,480
Yes, I do

389
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,220
When in college,

390
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,340
she worked very hard

391
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,150
It's also because she's been working hard that

392
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,960
she can achieve where she is now

393
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,590
And there're so many girls pursuing beauty

394
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,090
I really think the gossips on the internet

395
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,120
are so mean to her

396
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,690
You speak for her like this

397
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,780
Don't you hate for what she did to you before?

398
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,660
There was nothing wrong with her pursuing the person she liked

399
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:03,950
And

400
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:05,620
we had broken up at that time

401
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:12,280
We make our relationship public

402
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,680
Won't it make the matter more complicated?

403
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,800
I could only think of such a way then

404
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,970
I didn't mean to make it public

405
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:24,470
I'm fine

406
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:27,980
Everybody will know it anyway

407
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,430
It's also good to

408
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:31,700
solve a problem

409
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,740
I can finally

410
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,970
be your boyfriend in a proper way

411
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,690
Why isn't there any report?

412
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,400
What do these reporters work for?

413
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:13,750
Hello

414
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:14,800
Mr. Yan

415
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,830
all the rumors about you and Secretary Nie on the internet

416
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,930
have been withdrawn already

417
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,610
If there's any more...

418
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:20,510
You don't need to worry about it if there's any more

419
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:47,170
Then

420
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,040
Let me see if you can delete

421
00:22:58,450 --> 00:22:59,710
I didn't share for you to see

422
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,990
It's still Director Huang that's earnest and efficient

423
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,660
It's needless for you to say that

424
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,790
What a perfect match!

425
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,750
I'm so envious! So envious!

426
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,190
Of course you do!

427
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,290
Good morning

428
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,840
Morning! Morning! Morning!

429
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:38,630
Xingchen,

430
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,340
This is eye shadow I bought from abroad

431
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,470
I think it suits you expressly

432
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:43,290
Keep it!

433
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:44,460
Don't bother

434
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,300
I have this at home!

435
00:23:45,870 --> 00:23:47,110
Don't think too many eye shadows you have

436
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,340
It's good for you to use different brands

437
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,480
Alright! Thank you!

438
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:52,090
Sister Xingchen

439
00:23:52,330 --> 00:23:53,920
This is the chocolate endorsed by J

440
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:55,060
It tastes very good

441
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:55,950
I give it to you

442
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,020
I hope you and our boss

443
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,400
have a sweet life in future

444
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,820
Do not refuse me

445
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:01,000
or I'll be upset

446
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:03,350
Okay

447
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,390
Then let's share it later

448
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:07,200
Xingchen,

449
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,260
Sit down! Sit down! Sit down!

450
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,390
What are you doing?

451
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,680
Don't bring unhealthy ways and customs to PO,

452
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,560
Okay? Okay?

453
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,170
Go on with your work!

454
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:19,140
Secretary Nie,

455
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:21,070
This

456
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:23,970
is the foot bath bag I studied recently

457
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:25,340
I've asked my wife to try it

458
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,530
The effect was good

459
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:29,360
It specializes in woman's endocrine disorders

460
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,740
and insomnia and dreaminess. OK!

461
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,310
Then...

462
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,570
Thank you, Director Huang

463
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:34,700
The effect is particularly good

464
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:36,050
Director Huang

465
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,400
And everybody

466
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,070
The gifts you gave me today

467
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:40,520
I'll take them all for now

468
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,370
I'll take them as blessings from you all

469
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,740
But

470
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,130
I hope

471
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:47,190
we can get along with each other like before in future

472
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,350
Don't make the

473
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,460
private relationship between Mr. Yan and me

474
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:52,160
as a trouble to you all

475
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,350
What beautiful words!

476
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,120
I got the true meaning

477
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,130
She just wants

478
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,270
us to work

479
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,650
harder

480
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,630
and keep low-profile

481
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,610
in social relationships

482
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,390
Don't make other departments watch our jokes

483
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,610
If we think we have the backing of Mrs. Yan,

484
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,940
then we have an inflated sense of importance

485
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,440
and we'll lose common touch

486
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,000
Is that right?

487
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:21,630
Don't nod!

488
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,330
We're talking about you!

489
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,150
That...

490
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,480
Mrs. Yan

491
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,220
Director Huang, stop be low-profile

492
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:29,470
Our boss

493
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:32,120
has updated his WeChat moments to show his love

494
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,470
We all saw that

495
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:36,870
Check the WeChat moments!

496
00:25:37,390 --> 00:25:38,180
WeChat moments!

497
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:40,800
Show love!

498
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:43,620
Keep low-profile

499
00:25:44,530 --> 00:25:45,030
Foot bath!

500
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,840
Don't forget about it!

501
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,900
Foot bath! Foot bath!

502
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:50,360
WeChat moments!

503
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,730
Sister Ailu, I've changed this planning

504
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,640
Thanks

505
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:27,210
Guys

506
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,170
Recently,

507
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:31,700
there're a lot of news about us on the internet

508
00:26:32,530 --> 00:26:33,170
Then

509
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,850
We've known about each other for many years

510
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:38,820
And we're quite important people in each other's lives

511
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,330
I don't want either...

512
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,460
I don't want either... Listen carefully!

513
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,190
I don't want our relationship will be affected

514
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:53,390
by the false news

515
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,160
So we asked you out to have this talk

516
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,370
There're some problems need to be solved

517
00:26:58,550 --> 00:26:59,460
Your love affairs you hid by taking Xingchen

518
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,750
as your shield

519
00:27:00,810 --> 00:27:02,400
That has seriously affected her reputation

520
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,660
Don't you give an explanation?

521
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:05,970
Everybody is the same

522
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,460
You took Niannian

523
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,760
as your shield too before

524
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,700
The engagement

525
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,670
and marriage news were here and there

526
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,590
If you hadn't been so high-profile at that time,

527
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,320
nobody would

528
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,020
have hyped up your relationship now

529
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,060
One more!

530
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,280
Look at them!

531
00:27:28,590 --> 00:27:29,140
How disgusting!

532
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,630
I know you don't drink cold

533
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,840
Let me warm it up before you drink

534
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:38,480
Excuse me!

535
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,350
There has a complimentary dessert at this table

536
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:41,640
What flavor do you need?

537
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:42,500
I don't eat sweet food

538
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,370
You can eat whatever flavor you want

539
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,140
If you don't eat,

540
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,400
serve Xingchen a strawberry flavor

541
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,010
Don't bother

542
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,180
She has changed now

543
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:50,790
She likes matcha! Matcha!

544
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:52,030
OK, just a moment, please!

545
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,550
Let me help you

546
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,850
Actually, I have another purpose here

547
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,300
I think even we make

548
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,420
our relationship public,

549
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,100
the netizens may not believe it

550
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:10,550
Then why don't we take practical moves

551
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:13,350
to prove that our relationship is harmonious

552
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:16,760
So the rumors will collapse of itself

553
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,010
The former rivals have dinner together

554
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,840
That's the favorite gimmick of gossip news

555
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:24,500
This is a really good idea

556
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:26,890
We can reverse the direction of public opinion without efforts

557
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,030
I'll make my agent to follow up

558
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:30,900
Smooth!

559
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:35,340
Mr. Zhao,

560
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,110
can you play billiards?

561
00:28:37,670 --> 00:28:38,370
Can you?

562
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,070
My opponents are all professional players

563
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,220
Can you?

564
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:43,870
Don't be hooked by your own lies

565
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:46,570
Let's go!

566
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:51,830
Wait me!

567
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,420
Last time we met

568
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,110
in Jingzhi's office, right?

569
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,880
That's true!

570
00:29:04,450 --> 00:29:06,740
That was quite a show you two put on to me

571
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,790
And that was a paid show

572
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,620
You can also regard it as

573
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:14,350
that I took the chance to conduct a revenge on you

574
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,750
I decided to give up this relationship

575
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,300
not because I lost to you

576
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,390
but him

577
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,860
For five years,

578
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,860
he refused to show kindness to all the ladies around him

579
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:26,910
But he's still willing to think about your future

580
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:28,250
by placing himself in your' position

581
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,420
I envy you indeed!

582
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,900
Although Jingzhi is not good at expressing himself

583
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,160
he's still emotional in deep heart

584
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,560
You've been with him for five years

585
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,990
You have become an important person to him

586
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,630
I know

587
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,310
He couldn't give me love,

588
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,640
but he has given a lot of help in my career

589
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,360
I still need to thank him

590
00:29:52,770 --> 00:29:53,600
Now

591
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,700
I can finally bless you two frankly

592
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,530
He really has done a lot for you

593
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,090
You must be always happy!

594
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,500
Thank you! Zhen Nian

595
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,090
But

596
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,160
when I knew

597
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,800
you were with Zhao Yuanfang,

598
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,260
I was quiet surprised

599
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,470
To be honest,

600
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,760
I haven't thought about this either that

601
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,740
I would fall in love with a playboy

602
00:30:17,470 --> 00:30:18,000
but...

603
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,420
He isn't reliable

604
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,710
as he looks like

605
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,560
He's been reluctant to make girlfriend before,

606
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,230
saying it was too complicated

607
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,130
But he's willing to admit

608
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,100
your relationship publicly

609
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,170
That means he has thought it over carefully

610
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:33,240
I think you can trust him

611
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,650
I just think

612
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:38,010
I'm happy to be with him

613
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,320
I can live the way as I was

614
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,690
and don't have to suppress myself as before

615
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,520
But as for how far can we go

616
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,170
It doesn't matter already!

617
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:53,600
Then can we be friends

618
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:55,520
from today on?

619
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:57,140
Sure

620
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,740
Let's disclose Yan and Zhao's secrets!

621
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,250
Didn't you say to drive you home?

622
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:08,420
Why do we come here?

623
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,010
Ziyu,

624
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,340
you've been distracted recently

625
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,470
I'm really worried about you!

626
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:14,910
What if the situation occurs

627
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,120
during the surgery?

628
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:18,510
Thanks for reminding me!

629
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,630
I'll be concentrated

630
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,020
I like this feeling now very much

631
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,170
Everyday I can go to work with you

632
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,870
and take a walk after work

633
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,730
This is the life I want to live

634
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:35,660
What do you want to say?

635
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:45,880
Ziyu,

636
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,880
I know

637
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,100
Maybe it isn't a good time to talk about this

638
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,310
But I cannot really bear it that

639
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,650
you continue to be depressed

640
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,160
I adore you

641
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,160
I liked you since we were in college

642
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:04,730
How could you...

643
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:09,780
I've always regarded you as a friend of mine

644
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,340
I returned from abroad solely because of you

645
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:15,870
Ziyu,

646
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,850
No matter when at work or in life,

647
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,290
we're the best partner

648
00:32:19,610 --> 00:32:21,250
No one else is more suitable for each other than us

649
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:25,180
For so many years,

650
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,190
I've been waiting for you

651
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,780
But I don't want to wait anymore

652
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:44,510
Then

653
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:47,430
I also wish you and Dr. Bai well

654
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,150
So that's what she meant!

655
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:53,760
What?

656
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,230
Sorry

657
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:58,860
I cannot accept

658
00:33:07,330 --> 00:33:08,500
Is it because of Tong Xin?

659
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,780
She isn't suitable for you in all respects

660
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:14,750
That's right

661
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:16,910
Once I thought that

662
00:33:17,830 --> 00:33:18,920
my wife should be

663
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,110
as perfect and irreproachable as you

664
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,580
if I got married

665
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,550
But since I knew Tong Xin,

666
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,440
she's been refreshing my understanding of girls

667
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:29,840
I can feel really happy

668
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,520
when I be with her

669
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:34,350
Do you fall in love with her?

670
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,780
I don't know what love feels like

671
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,750
But I know

672
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,430
Tong Xin is different from others to me

673
00:33:44,870 --> 00:33:46,330
Your feeling isn't reliable

674
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:47,160
Ziyu

675
00:33:47,430 --> 00:33:48,890
We've known each other for almost ten years

676
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,840
No one else knows you better than I do

677
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,520
That matters most

678
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,360
Is that true?

679
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,160
But understanding

680
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,100
is no substitute for love

681
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,040
Sorry

682
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:03,910
We're just suitable as friends

683
00:34:11,590 --> 00:34:12,420
At six o'clock this evening,

684
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:13,650
can we meet?

685
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,670
It's simply a meeting!

686
00:34:37,970 --> 00:34:39,180
What am I afraid of?

687
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,390
Hello,

688
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:01,500
does it still open?

689
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,280
Someone asked me to come here...

690
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:05,680
You...

691
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,470
What are you doing here?

692
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:09,420
How come you dress like this?

693
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,490
I checked about J's styling

694
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:14,540
I thought you would like it

695
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,810
But

696
00:36:20,510 --> 00:36:22,100
Why would you do this?

697
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,520
This is a farewell party I prepared for you

698
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:28,260
From today on,

699
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,210
you're no longer a fan of mine

700
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,490
I'm no longer your idol

701
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:41,940
It's so good!

702
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,060
I idolized a real star

703
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:48,860
Even the farewell includes the fan services

704
00:36:51,990 --> 00:36:53,240
You're the No.1 fan of mine

705
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,990
Thank you, Dr. Han

706
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,920
I'll remember the song you snag to me

707
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:07,570
Bye

708
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,050
Tong Xin

709
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,700
Let's know each other again

710
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,790
My name is Han Ziyu

711
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,640
From today on,

712
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,550
You're no longer a fan of mine

713
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,550
but a girl I like

714
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,540
Can you be my girlfriend?

715
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,580
The real girlfriend of mine

716
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:42,390
Dr. Han

717
00:37:43,270 --> 00:37:44,960
Don't play any trick on me again

718
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:46,740
I'm seriously

719
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:47,760
Then

720
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:49,630
Then

721
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,600
Then kiss me!

722
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,010
I...

723
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:01,630
I'm not dreaming, am I?

724
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:13,460
I...

725
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,230
I've succeed in chasing true love

726
00:38:59,260 --> 00:39:00,360
Cinema proposal?

727
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:03,320
It's nothing new!

728
00:39:06,070 --> 00:39:07,160
Billboards?

729
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,310
Xingchen doesn't like to be watched

730
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:14,850
Why is there a reliable scheme?

731
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,900
Except the hotels, KTV and shopping malls,

732
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,990
don't you have other places

733
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:36,740
to recommend?

734
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,440
In fact, the venue is just a space

735
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,230
The most important is

736
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:41,960
we can customize your romantic moments

737
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:44,260
based on your needs

738
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,860
I just know that these places you provide

739
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,250
do not meet my requirements

740
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,880
Mr. Yan,

741
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,730
can you provide us some

742
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,940
your girlfriend's preferences

743
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,320
Thus we can customize the targeted planning

744
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,630
according to her preferences

745
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,590
Jingzhi

746
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,710
Just do as I said

747
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:11,920
OK! OK! OK!

748
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:14,780
I didn't know you had guests at home

749
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,060
They're from the branch office

750
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,600
I already know the details

751
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,650
You can go back

752
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:19,920
Okay

753
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,430
I remember that you

754
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,940
never let the staff from the company to come home

755
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:35,480
There was an emergency

756
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:36,800
What happened?

757
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:37,640
I've dealt with it already

758
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,100
Why don't you tell me?

759
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,770
I have something more important to tell you

760
00:40:44,930 --> 00:40:45,350
Xingchen,

761
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,090
I'm hungry

762
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,760
Can you cook something for me?

763
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,330
I'm hungry, too

764
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,380
But I don't want to cook

765
00:40:52,770 --> 00:40:53,550
Then I'll eat you

766
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:58,210
What? You just surrender!

767
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:03,460
I've dreamed countless scenes where I am confessed

768
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:04,890
But I never thought

769
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,440
it would be a farewell of fans

770
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,520
So that when I woke up,

771
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:10,880
I still doubted that if I was dreaming

772
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:13,420
Dr. Han's reflex arc is so long!

773
00:41:13,750 --> 00:41:15,590
But it's good for him to confess you actively

774
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,810
Sister Xingchen,

775
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,210
have you ever dreamed

776
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,710
the scenes where you're proposed?

777
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:21,770
I don't dare to think

778
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,730
The more you think, the greater your disappointment will be

779
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,930
You make yourself up so beautiful

780
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:33,770
Are you going on a date?

781
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:35,560
Yeah!

782
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:36,660
Xingchen,

783
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,410
I have a crush on a boy recently

784
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:39,440
I want to give him a surprise

785
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,110
Do you have any suggestions?

786
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,040
You really ask the wrong person

787
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:44,060
I'm afraid of surprises most

788
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,440
Afraid of surprises most?

789
00:41:51,570 --> 00:41:52,140
Secretary Nie,

790
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:53,840
You're busy

791
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,310
You and Mr. Yan have known each other for a long time

792
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,190
When do you plan to get married?

793
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:02,030
I quiet like the present state of life

794
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,030
I'm not rushing for getting married!

795
00:42:06,550 --> 00:42:07,220
You aren't in a rush!

796
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:10,220
Yes!

797
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:16,610
You aren't in a rush! But I do!

798
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:19,200
You three are the confidants I can trust most

799
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:21,370
But you asked nothing at all

800
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,370
I really should give you a thumb

801
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,970
I might as well trust those two men

802
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:27,910
Mr. Yan

803
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,610
We've made a profound review

804
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,380
Why don't you give us another opportunity?

805
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:35,020
And we can try again!

806
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:35,910
No!

807
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:37,420
It's too obvious if you ask now

808
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,730
Is there any way else?

809
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:41,150
Such as circuitous tactic or the like?

810
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:43,630
Mr. Yan

811
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,490
Just do as what I said!

812
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:47,130
You got that?

813
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:48,290
Understood

814
00:42:48,470 --> 00:42:48,970
You can go out!

815
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:50,100
Come back!

816
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,080
This is the last chance

817
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,440
Understood

818
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:09,570
You scare them again

819
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:10,490
I didn't

820
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:14,630
I always feel weird

821
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:15,820
What's weird?

822
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,340
Secretary Nie,

823
00:43:18,650 --> 00:43:20,170
I need the financial statement of this month

824
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:21,790
Okay, Mr. Yan

825
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:33,680
Xingchen,

826
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:35,010
May I use your computer?

827
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:37,160
It's on the couch!

828
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:37,870
Take it by yourself!

829
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:55,710
Fantasy Town!

830
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,030
What?

831
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:18,410
What mail did you receive to

832
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,240
make you so happy?

833
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:21,520
A problem that puzzled for a long time

834
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:22,690
was solved by me

835
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,830
Then congrats!

836
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:26,170
Thanks for that!

837
00:44:26,770 --> 00:44:28,060
I won't go to the company tomorrow

838
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:28,930
I have another arrangement

839
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:40,730
I'm waiting you to call me when you finish cooking

840
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:44,780
Childish

841
00:44:45,940 --> 00:44:47,120
Starting from here

842
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,920
is the main space where you propose

843
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,440
Then Miss Nie will come up to this staircase

844
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:53,620
It's the final venue where you propose

845
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:09,730
Close the door after you come in

846
00:45:22,990 --> 00:45:23,850
You three

847
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:26,130
are the confidants I can trust most

848
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,450
I have something to share with you

849
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:35,500
I'm going to propose to Secretary Nie

850
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:42,950
Mr. Yan

851
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:45,180
You're willing to share such a good news

852
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:45,930
with us

853
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:47,510
It's a great honor for us!

854
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,020
So

855
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,680
Now, I'll arrange you to ask about

856
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,240
Secretary Nie's preferences in this aspect

857
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:53,580
You must be sure to keep it a secret

858
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,020
and don't let her know in advance

859
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:57,140
Mr. Yan, you don't need to worry about it!

860
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,700
We'll certainly live up to your expectations

861
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:03,020
Can we ask Secretary Sun and Secretary Jin to

862
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:03,750
join us?

863
00:46:03,790 --> 00:46:04,250
Don't bother

864
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:05,600
They're men

865
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:06,850
and not suitable for this job

866
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:08,710
Confidant!

867
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:10,360
Confidant! Confidant!

868
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,450
You can go out!
