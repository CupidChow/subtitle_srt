1
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,440
What?

2
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,490
Does Yan Jingzhi forget you again?

3
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,970
Such a wicked man!

4
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,320
I will definitely go to him to...

5
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,320
I must go to him to...

6
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:46,870
I…

7
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,920
Well, Well, Well!

8
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,020
Please stop acting!

9
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,370
Okay

10
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,740
It's no use

11
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,020
He lost all his memories when he returned home

12
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,090
Let alone me,

13
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,570
he should not even know you

14
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,890
No wonder he just

15
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,670
called me full name

16
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:05,890
Then it's in time

17
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:06,970
Pack your things

18
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:07,940
and to resign

19
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:09,770
No!

20
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,670
Are you crazy or stupid?

21
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,570
When Yan Jingzhi lost his memory for the first time,

22
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,990
you two have been separated for five years

23
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,620
How many years are you going to spend on him the second time?

24
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,990
For the first time, I have voluntarily given up on him

25
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,320
This time,

26
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,870
I won't leave first

27
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,290
What are you gonna do?

28
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,920
What else can I do?

29
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,620
It's being unreasonable for me to be jealous

30
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,420
I have to find a way

31
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,670
to let him accept me again

32
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,040
OK

33
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,940
So now that you've made up your mind,

34
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,540
it's no use talking nonsense

35
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,370
But remember

36
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,170
I…

37
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,040
Always behind me

38
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,420
What's behind you?

39
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,640
Behind you is an idiot

40
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,770
I will always be by your side

41
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:57,970
Got it! Got it!

42
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,840
It's about to off work

43
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,690
What to eat in the evening?

44
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,090
No, thanks

45
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,470
I'll work overtime tonight

46
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:08,590
What?

47
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,020
Do you have a fever or something?

48
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,890
What's there to work overtime in that stupid place?

49
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:14,070
You don't understand

50
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:16,290
It's gold that shines everywhere

51
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,220
I have to let Yan Jingzhi personally transfer me back

52
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,890
Are you insane?

53
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,290
One is crazy

54
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,420
and another is stupid

55
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,090
I don't know you guys

56
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,490
Don't come to me!

57
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,540
You're insane

58
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,720
Come in

59
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,020
I brought you something delicious

60
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,540
I shouldn't have babbled last time

61
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,820
I just...

62
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,670
Just...

63
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:27,970
I know

64
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,940
You were trying to protect me!

65
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:32,890
I checked it online

66
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,420
Because of the filter,

67
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,570
fans seem to be particularly repulsive

68
00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:37,820
to the opposite sex around idols

69
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,570
and that no one is worthy of their own idol

70
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,840
Actually, Dr. Bai and I...

71
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,090
I must apologize to Dr. Bai next time

72
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:50,190
It was all my fault last time

73
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:51,490
It doesn't matter

74
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,770
She would't mind

75
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,070
Then can I ask you a question?

76
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,070
You

77
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:05,540
wouldn't contact me

78
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,490
if I don't take the initiative to find you?

79
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:12,420
I heard you have been very busy recently

80
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,920
and working overtime every day

81
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:15,020
So I...

82
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,420
So that's why you didn't contact me?

83
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:28,620
Are you satisfied with...

84
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:32,790
with...

85
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:41,040
with my work of the support club?

86
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,290
I'm very happy

87
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,690
being your idol

88
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,490
No! No! No!

89
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,040
I am happier to be your fan

90
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,690
Secretary Jin,

91
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,620
Come in for a second

92
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:55,690
Mr. Yan

93
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:57,470
Send me an electronic file

94
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,970
of report on major economic decisions

95
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,520
of the company in the past ten years

96
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,720
Sorry, Mr. Yan

97
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,270
There is not all the information in the company database

98
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,020
This is an economic file

99
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:07,490
Maybe it's in the archives

100
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,370
I'm going to find it

101
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,370
Don't bother

102
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:11,020
You can get off work

103
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,670
I'll get it myself

104
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,020
Yes

105
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,590
Mr. Yan, are you all right?

106
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,370
I'm fine

107
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,820
Is anything I can do for you?

108
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,390
Yes

109
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:58,370
Show me

110
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,890
the report on major economic decisions

111
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:00,820
of the company in the past ten years

112
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:02,390
No problem

113
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,270
Then I'll deliver it to your office in the next morning

114
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,190
I want it now

115
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,440
You have ten minutes

116
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,170
No problem

117
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:09,990
It happened that

118
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,670
I sorted the important documents

119
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:12,620
and the ordinary documents

120
00:08:12,770 --> 00:08:14,440
And I dealt with these

121
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,620
with obscuring entry

122
00:08:15,770 --> 00:08:16,490
Please wait a moment

123
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,840
It should be found soon

124
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:36,840
Have you found it?

125
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,620
Just wait a little longer

126
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,290
Do you need my help?

127
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,020
No, thanks

128
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:55,220
Yes

129
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,440
Yes

130
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,970
It's OK

131
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,220
Here you are

132
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,920
Mr. Yan

133
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:52,940
Your files

134
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:02,320
Don't get me wrong

135
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,420
I'll have someone clear the surveillance video

136
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,090
Yan Jingzhi

137
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,670
I'll get you back

138
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,770
Good morning, Secretary Jin

139
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,240
Morning!

140
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,670
I'll send something to Mr. Yan

141
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:50,370
Give it to me

142
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,490
and I'll hand it over for you

143
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,990
This is Mr. Yan's personal belongings

144
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,520
I'd better give it to him myself

145
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,090
You can't go inside

146
00:10:58,570 --> 00:10:59,690
As a secretary,

147
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,240
it's my duty to help the boss

148
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,290
filter out the unnecessary meetings

149
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,540
Besides,

150
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,820
Mr. Yan has made a special account

151
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,140
that you're forbidden to appear here

152
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,770
Please forgive me!

153
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:42,790
Mr. Yan

154
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:45,220
You're waiting for me?

155
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,340
Yes

156
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:48,690
How did you know I'm coming down at the time?

157
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,490
I know you'll attend the science and technology meeting at ten o'clock

158
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:53,570
It's just alright to leave half an hour in advance

159
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,340
Mr. Yan

160
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,140
Mr. Yan, a moment please

161
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:57,620
Mr. Yan told me

162
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,890
you can leave it to me

163
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,020
if you're returning clothes

164
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,940
He doesn't want to talk to you about other things

165
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,970
Thank you, Secretary Jin

166
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:19,670
Hello, hello

167
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:21,290
Hi! Secretary Nie

168
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,370
I'm Wu Qun, manager of the real estate company

169
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:26,040
Hello, Miss Wu

170
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:27,090
Is there anything you want to say?

171
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,270
Your house is ready

172
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,540
You can come over

173
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,720
to get the keys when you're free

174
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,870
What house?

175
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:34,870
Didn't you apply for

176
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,320
the house before?

177
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,140
Mr. Yan gave you a special approval

178
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:40,040
and it's next door to Mr. Yan's

179
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,390
Next door?

180
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,420
Yes!

181
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:46,720
Okay

182
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:47,470
I see

183
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:48,290
Thanks a lot!

184
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,940
Next door?

185
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,040
Supervisor Wu

186
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,270
I have something urgent this afternoon

187
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,470
I want to take a leave

188
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:01,250
I see

189
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,070
Go ahead!

190
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,920
Where is the leave form?

191
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,620
You

192
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:10,140
look smart

193
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,720
Why are you so dumb?

194
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,190
Don't I need to fill a leave of absence?

195
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,490
Compare this company to the ancient harem

196
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:19,140
and our archive room is the limbo

197
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,220
Nobody cares what you do

198
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,440
You just remember to come back and clock out

199
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:27,890
Thanks, supervisor Wu

200
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:12,420
Hello

201
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,470
Sir, have you arrived yet?

202
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:16,190
I have too many things with

203
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,220
North gate?

204
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,940
Let me pick you up

205
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:16,620
Because you are

206
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,370
the star that lights up my whole universe

207
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:21,120
I never believed in fate before

208
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,240
until I met you

209
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,340
When we met again,

210
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,690
I thought

211
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,790
many things in life

212
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,420
are already doomed

213
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,020
We have missed each other for five years

214
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:37,920
I don't want to wait any longer

215
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,270
Yan Jingzhi

216
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,540
Is this your surprise?

217
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,820
But now,

218
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,090
you've forgotten

219
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,090
The decoration style is the same as your home

220
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,920
And your favorite couch

221
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:35,620
But

222
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,270
you're not by my side anymore

223
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:51,070
Tell me

224
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,320
where did you go?

225
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,420
I was looking for you just now

226
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:54,190
to send you afternoon tea

227
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,140
But you were not here

228
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,720
I'm moving

229
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:57,920
and didn't go to the company

230
00:16:59,320 --> 00:16:59,970
Moving?

231
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:01,020
Where are you going to move?

232
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,270
Before, Yan Jingzhi

233
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,940
gave me a special grant for a welfare-oriented house,

234
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,240
which is next door to his

235
00:17:05,870 --> 00:17:07,690
Maybe he wants to give me a surprise

236
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:10,340
Although the goal has not been achieved,

237
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:11,370
now I'm right about my urgent need

238
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,090
in this house

239
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,090
He doesn't even talk to you at the company

240
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,290
Are you expecting

241
00:17:16,670 --> 00:17:18,390
he likes you when you are his neighbor

242
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:19,970
So

243
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,820
I want to meet him again

244
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:23,440
as a stranger

245
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,120
Just like when he returned home

246
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,440
OK

247
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,720
You play spy games!

248
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,820
I'm having afternoon tea

249
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:30,990
Bye

250
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,090
It's four o'clock

251
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:44,440
Wait!

252
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,220
Mr. Yan

253
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,520
Now

254
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,640
you should work in the archives

255
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,690
I went out to do something

256
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,970
Where's the written request for leave?

257
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:07,620
I am no longer your secretary

258
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,740
Leave only needs to go through the procedure of archives

259
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:13,020
I haven't approve

260
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,120
the personnel transfer in the past week

261
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,540
So you still belongs to PO

262
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,770
Didn't the HR tell you

263
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,340
when you took leave?

264
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,240
I didn't ask for leave

265
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:24,220
Absenteeism

266
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,220
without permission,

267
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,340
you violated the company's

268
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:27,440
the seventh clause of the sixth article

269
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:30,970
I'll ask the HR to draw up a dismissal announcement

270
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,690
Mr....Mr. Yan

271
00:18:34,170 --> 00:18:35,340
Mr. Yan, you can't fire me

272
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,620
What's the excuse this time?

273
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,370
I made an implementation plan to optimize the building of archives

274
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,570
according to the real situation

275
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:42,740
I went out to consult professionals, too

276
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,370
I'm sorry

277
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,470
it's not what you said about absenteeism for no reason

278
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,220
Don't you think you'll be transferred back

279
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:48,890
to the PO because of your hard work

280
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,290
Loving working

281
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,620
is indeed one of the advantages of me

282
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,640
I want to hear the truth

283
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:56,920
That's right

284
00:18:57,590 --> 00:18:59,940
Although Secretary Jin has a strong working ability,

285
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:01,820
I'm

286
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:04,490
the most suitable Secretary for you

287
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:07,370
Because no one knows you better than I do

288
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,840
I want to see how suitable you are

289
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,890
Indeed as expected to win over workaholics

290
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:22,840
with work only

291
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,490
Bluetooth is connected

292
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,810
Bluetooth is disconnected

293
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,040
Bluetooth is connected

294
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:57,970
What's wrong?

295
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:02,290
There is electricity!

296
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:14,920
Who is it?

297
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,370
Why is he here?

298
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,420
Is he...

299
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,620
No!

300
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,190
Wait!

301
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:12,020
Sorry

302
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,670
I'm taking a shower and applying a mask

303
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:15,940
You have connected the wrong Bluetooth

304
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:18,390
It was my fault

305
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,590
Sorry!

306
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:20,970
Sorry to disturb your rest

307
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,870
Occasional mistakes are understandable

308
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,790
But I hope that in the days to come

309
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,490
you can try to avoid making such unnecessary noise

310
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,270
I'll pay more attention next time

311
00:23:31,970 --> 00:23:33,040
You just moved here?

312
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,620
Let's get to know each other again!

313
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:39,670
My name is

314
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,520
Coco

315
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,120
Nice to meet you!

316
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,220
Yan Jingzhi

317
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:52,620
I won't disturb your rest

318
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,720
Fortunately,

319
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,120
I was prepared

320
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,420
Your memory is lost,

321
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,190
but taste is always the same

322
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:16,640
I can't believe I can't handle you

323
00:25:44,890 --> 00:25:45,870
Pineapple flavor!

324
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,620
I hope you can forget what happened last night

325
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:55,470
after you finish eating breakfast

326
00:25:55,890 --> 00:25:57,290
Have a nice day!

327
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:07,920
Good morning, Secretary Jin

328
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:08,520
Morning!

329
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,620
Mr. Yan is waiting for you

330
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,790
What's the matter?

331
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,490
I'm not sure about this

332
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,320
I'm not already exposed, am I?

333
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:26,840
Mr. Yan

334
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,990
Do you know why I called you here?

335
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,340
I don't know

336
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,120
You don't even know about my

337
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
work habits and way of thinking

338
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,270
How come you said

339
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,970
you're the most suitable secretary for me?

340
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:42,290
It turned out that I was not exposed

341
00:26:44,890 --> 00:26:45,840
Your work habit

342
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,640
is to deal with all the work that day

343
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:48,770
So last night,

344
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,520
you should have finished reading my report

345
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:53,020
and thought that it is feasible

346
00:26:53,470 --> 00:26:54,890
If I didn't guess wrong,

347
00:26:55,070 --> 00:26:57,070
you should have called me here today for

348
00:26:57,570 --> 00:26:58,920
the matter of file optimization

349
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:01,790
Why didn't you say just now?

350
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,820
I am no longer your secretary

351
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,190
So it is inconvenient to speculate on the boss's thoughts without permission

352
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,270
What is the core of the optimization scheme?

353
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,120
There are two points

354
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:15,620
First, we must improve the building of the archives intranet

355
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,320
to ensure that each application system

356
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,390
to enable the self-inquiry reading service to be used

357
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,290
Second, I hope to increase

358
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,270
data analysis and mining services in LAN

359
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,040
This is also the difficulty in the implementation of this program

360
00:27:28,170 --> 00:27:29,370
The overall idea is good

361
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,970
However, implementation details are lacking

362
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,540
You can continue to push forward

363
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:33,770
after communicating with the Technical Department

364
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,490
But

365
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,270
It did surprise me a little

366
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:38,440
that you could write such a proposal

367
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,390
within two days

368
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:42,590
Thank you for your approval

369
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,140
If things go smoothly like this,

370
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:47,190
I'll be back to the PO soon

371
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:48,090
I'll have your supervisor

372
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:49,990
follow up

373
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,040
You can go out now

374
00:27:52,070 --> 00:27:53,720
I am the one who knows the plan best

375
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,970
Why do you want to change people?

376
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,390
Report bypassing the immediate leadership

377
00:27:56,470 --> 00:27:58,190
It is already a violation of the company's regulations

378
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:00,540
In view of your outstanding performance at work,

379
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:02,270
I'm not holding you accountable

380
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:05,520
I'm just getting everything back on track

381
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:11,590
I also very much hope that

382
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,420
everything can really get back on track

383
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:19,490
Then I'll go out first

384
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:27,940
Yan Jingzhi

385
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:30,190
There are times definitely when you come to beg me

386
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,390
Is there anything else?

387
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
No

388
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,020
Mr. Yan

389
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,840
Here is your coffee

390
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,320
This is

391
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:42,340
Guaraná Coffee

392
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,970
Guaraná is a fruit grown up

393
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:46,240
in the Amazon jungle in Brazil

394
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:49,490
It is said that its refreshing effect is four times that of coffee

395
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,140
I think you are a little tired

396
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,520
so I prepared this

397
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,120
It's very tasty

398
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,970
Then I'll prepare some

399
00:30:57,970 --> 00:30:59,170
refreshing food

400
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,440
that helps relieve fatigue such as

401
00:31:00,570 --> 00:31:02,870
tuna, celery and orange

402
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:03,820
Is that all right?

403
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:05,190
Secretary Jin,

404
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:06,340
it's very thoughtful of you

405
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,240
This is my duty

406
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,520
It seems that

407
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,740
you had a good understanding of what I like

408
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,170
from the very beginning

409
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,840
I have a senior in the American company headquarters

410
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,390
I learned from him before I came

411
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,490
All right!

412
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,590
Think about it!

413
00:31:27,970 --> 00:31:29,140
If there is a person

414
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,590
who knows your life preferences very well

415
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,470
even you've only met her once

416
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:37,520
Do you think these are just coincidences?

417
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:40,390
It may be a simple coincidence

418
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,190
may also be that he comes to you

419
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:44,390
with a certain purpose

420
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:48,390
Secretary Jin

421
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,970
Help me prepare a thank-you gift

422
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:52,720
Okay

423
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,590
He is Dr. Han's girlfriend

424
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,190
But I think Dr. Bai is better

425
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:08,240
Totally

426
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,320
It turns out that everyone thinks

427
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,090
I don't deserve Dr. Han

428
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:23,490
Dr. Bai

429
00:32:23,690 --> 00:32:24,320
Come in

430
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,490
Ziyu will be back in a minute

431
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,140
By the way, Dr. Bai

432
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,470
I am sorry

433
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:38,190
It's my fault last time

434
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,240
It doesn't matter

435
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,570
You don't have to take it to heart

436
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,320
You

437
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,690
One of Ziyu's buttons fell off

438
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:50,990
and I'm sewing it for him conveniently

439
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,040
How can such a trifle bother Dr. Bai?

440
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,920
Let me sew it

441
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,700
There are only two stitches left

442
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:00,320
What's wrong?

443
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,090
Dr. Han

444
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,020
Are you okay?

445
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,090
It's ok

446
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,440
Sticking band-aid on it is okay!

447
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,840
I'm sorry, Dr. Bai,

448
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:14,720
I didn't mean to

449
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:15,820
It doesn't matter

450
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:16,820
You don't mind

451
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:19,320
How did you come?

452
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,640
I...

453
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,740
I'm here to apply for a meeting

454
00:33:27,470 --> 00:33:28,290
I'm going to have a dinner

455
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,720
with Dr. Bai tonight

456
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:32,570
It doesn't matter

457
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,070
Miss Tong, come with us!

458
00:33:36,070 --> 00:33:37,320
Then it's my treat tonight

459
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,890
for apologizing to Dr. Bai for what happened last time

460
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:40,920
Okay

461
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,320
Then I'll get changed

462
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,520
Think about it!

463
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,490
You're always reckless

464
00:33:52,770 --> 00:33:53,970
It's either you fall yourself

465
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,420
or get others wounded

466
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:09,390
Dr. Bai

467
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,140
Was Dr. Han very popular among girls

468
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:13,220
at college?

469
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:14,370
Of course,

470
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,620
he was our school hunk

471
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,490
But no girl has ever chased him

472
00:34:19,070 --> 00:34:20,670
What on earth were you thinking at that time?

473
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,170
I just thought that

474
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,940
girls are very troublesome

475
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,090
Then I want to thank you

476
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:29,890
for tolerating me for so many years

477
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,390
I remember

478
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:40,390
there was a girl in the art department at that time

479
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:41,720
She chased you for more than a month

480
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:43,290
Then I didn't know

481
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,790
how she misunderstood us as lover

482
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,320
and came to you crying

483
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:48,490
Do you know what he said to the girl?

484
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,970
He told the girl:"

485
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:54,270
that’s just

486
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,570
excessive catecholamine secretion,

487
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,370
which led short-term myocardial colic

488
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,490
And he asked the girl to take a good rest

489
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,440
In fact,

490
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,540
I blocked a lot of pursuers for you

491
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,840
when at college

492
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:07,690
So

493
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,840
I have to thank you for saving my life

494
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,020
Dr. Bai

495
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,720
Didn't you have a boyfriend in college?

496
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:27,270
I have to focus on the professional classes

497
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:29,290
I really didn't have the energy to disperse to others

498
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,540
Do you remember

499
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:34,520
there was a glorious history of becoming famous

500
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,420
when you were in anatomy class?

501
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,640
At that time, our anatomy teacher said

502
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:45,320
people's left and right hearts cannot be directly connected

503
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:48,020
unless through a large circle of blood circulation

504
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:50,720
I think it's like having a crush on someone

505
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,490
He doesn't know I've been so close

506
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,320
But when he goes around a big circle, he will find that

507
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,570
I’m always there for him actually

508
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,240
Dr. Han

509
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:06,520
I have something to say to you

510
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:09,190
What's wrong?

511
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:10,020
Sit down and talk!

512
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:11,540
I…

513
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:18,420
I want to add some water

514
00:36:20,540 --> 00:36:21,440
Excuse me, may I be excused for a minute

515
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:23,020
and call the waiter for you

516
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,140
Dr. Han

517
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,990
I apply for fan talk time

518
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:33,620
Okay

519
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,540
Go ahead, please

520
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,720
In fact

521
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,590
What kind of girls do you like?

522
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:42,740
Er...

523
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,590
I don't know either

524
00:36:44,870 --> 00:36:47,190
Because I really don't know much about girls

525
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,770
How come?

526
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,740
You've gone to the blind date so many times

527
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:54,040
You should have been an ideal mate selection standard, right?

528
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:57,820
First of all, she must be filial

529
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,990
About the character,

530
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,870
she should be simple and straightforward

531
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,720
It would be better if she could be quiet

532
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,890
The first two are all right

533
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,470
But the last one...

534
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:13,490
What are you thinking about?

535
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:16,140
I will try my best

536
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,820
I mean

537
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:23,470
I will try my best to help you run the support club

538
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,570
Enjoy yourself

539
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:31,120
You too

540
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,820
Dr. Bai

541
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,190
What were you talking about just now?

542
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:40,090
Nothing

543
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:43,470
We are talking about the dinner

544
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,520
Have dinner!

545
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:26,720
What's wrong?

546
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,290
Did he follow me?

547
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,190
A moment

548
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,720
please!

549
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:44,940
What's the matter?

550
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:46,120
What happened?

551
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,890
Nothing

552
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,520
Do you need help?

553
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,270
No, thanks

554
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,520
Wait a minute

555
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,820
Did anything happen?

556
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:15,190
I just sprained my ankle in the bathroom

557
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,190
If you are not used to it,

558
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,270
I can help you walk

559
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,790
I'm fine

560
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:28,720
Thank you for your help

561
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,740
You also like rosemary

562
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:42,120
Yeah!

563
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,140
I always use shampoo with this flavor

564
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,720
What's wrong?

565
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:47,840
I'm fine

566
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,070
Do you have an ice pack at home?

567
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:55,990
It's in the bottom left of refrigerator

568
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,590
Apply it first

569
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,640
If it's still swollen,

570
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:25,840
you still need to go to the hospital

571
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,320
It doesn't matter

572
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:29,740
I sprained my ankle before

573
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,890
It will be

574
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,490
alright tomorrow

575
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:39,570
There's nothing to treat you at home

576
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:43,370
Eat some sugar!

577
00:40:46,970 --> 00:40:48,090
You like this, too?

578
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:49,570
Yeah!

579
00:40:49,890 --> 00:40:51,370
It's my favorite brand

580
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:55,040
And it is good to eat sugar

581
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,820
It cannot only relieve emotions,

582
00:40:57,140 --> 00:41:00,170
but also replenish when hypoglycemia occurs

583
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,140
Did we know each other before?

584
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:09,720
Why do you ask?

585
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:12,590
By an intuition!

586
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:16,320
I take the liberty of asking

587
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,520
Can I have a look at your face?

588
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:20,570
Sorry!

589
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:21,540
It isn't very convenient!

590
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:26,770
Thank you for your help today

591
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,070
By the way,

592
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,170
This is a gift for you

593
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,190
Thank you for breakfast these days

594
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:46,120
Did you choose it?

595
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,520
The secretary chose it

596
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,240
I wanted to make breakfast for you myself

597
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,990
I don't need any material rewards

598
00:41:54,290 --> 00:41:56,440
If you must make up for me,

599
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,720
I wish it were of human kindness

600
00:41:58,770 --> 00:42:00,190
like today

601
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,640
Please close the door for me when you leave

602
00:42:07,090 --> 00:42:07,720
Don't bother

603
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,120
I can do it myself

604
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,520
Niannian

605
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:58,970
Here's you express.

606
00:42:59,470 --> 00:43:00,790
I haven't bought anything recently

607
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,070
Who is the sender?

608
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:03,040
Let me take a look

609
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:08,270
- I Am Your Father -

610
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,640
Father?

611
00:43:13,870 --> 00:43:14,840
Let’s get down to business

612
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,790
You shall attend a business reception

613
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,420
with the boss of Aida Group at night

614
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,820
I really don't like that occasion

615
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,720
Can't I have a good look at the script?

616
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,670
Your most important task now

617
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,170
is to get along well with Party A

618
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,920
and to win the endorsement of the next season

619
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:32,540
Look

620
00:43:33,090 --> 00:43:34,720
The dress is all ready

621
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,090
- I Am Your Father -

622
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:38,870
It turned out to be Party A

623
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:39,820
Come on

624
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:40,620
Check if it fits you well

625
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:44,140
How nice it is!

626
00:43:57,420 --> 00:43:58,590
It seems to be OK!

627
00:43:59,620 --> 00:44:00,620
There’s no need to ask for leave

628
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:27,540
Director Huang

629
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:29,890
It's just you

630
00:44:30,390 --> 00:44:31,520
They are all off work

631
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,190
Well, have some tea

632
00:44:34,570 --> 00:44:35,320
Don't bother

633
00:44:35,370 --> 00:44:36,990
I'm here to see Mr. Yan

634
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:37,920
Mr. Yan

635
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,220
Mr. Yan went to

636
00:44:39,270 --> 00:44:41,220
attend a business reception this afternoon

637
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:42,440
and there will be a dinner party tonight

638
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,120
I don't think he can go back to the company today

639
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,740
Well, what do you want to see him about?

640
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,720
The matter of file optimization

641
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,920
I can talk about it tomorrow

642
00:44:49,070 --> 00:44:50,370
Then I'll go first

643
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:51,290
Okay

644
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:52,040
See you later. Bye, Director Huang

645
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:52,820
See you

646
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:12,440
Hello, Zhao Yuanfang

647
00:45:12,740 --> 00:45:14,320
Are you free tonight?

648
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,790
Your dress is really beautiful

649
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:47,790
Thank you!

650
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:48,920
This is custom-made

651
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:50,340
Yes!

652
00:45:50,470 --> 00:45:51,620
This is Mr. Yan

653
00:45:52,670 --> 00:45:53,870
Mr. Yan. Mr. Yan

654
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:54,590
I've heard a lot about you

655
00:45:55,010 --> 00:45:55,690
Hello!

656
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,220
I wonder why are you so kind to come and accompany me

657
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,120
It turns out that you have another purpose

658
00:46:00,470 --> 00:46:02,840
Don't you just glance around when you come in!

659
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:04,390
Who are you hitting on?

660
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,590
You voice is too bad

661
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,320
You are very unfriendly to me now

662
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:08,670
Think about it yourself

663
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,940
They're watching you!

664
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:18,120
Mr. Yan

665
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:18,790
That one over there is

666
00:46:18,870 --> 00:46:20,520
Liao Zhigao, the boss of Hengji Real Estate

667
00:46:20,970 --> 00:46:22,340
Most of them came here

668
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:24,640
for the piece of land

669
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:41,890
Mr. Yan

670
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:43,220
What should I do with this suit?

671
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:44,290
Check it out

672
00:46:51,890 --> 00:46:52,920
What is this smell?

673
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:54,890
Rosemary

674
00:46:55,870 --> 00:46:57,120
I'll send it for dry cleaning right away

675
00:46:58,220 --> 00:46:58,690
Don't bother

676
00:46:59,170 --> 00:46:59,990
Just leave it here

677
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,290
Yes
