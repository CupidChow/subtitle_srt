1
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:46,420
Hello,

2
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,620
could you tell me the room number

3
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,520
of the patient who had a car accident jut now?

4
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,370
One five one five

5
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,520
Thank you

6
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,100
Nurse,

7
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,420
where is the patient in this bed?

8
00:02:06,650 --> 00:02:07,700
She was here just now

9
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,670
Where has she been?

10
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,550
Why didn't you watch the patient?

11
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:10,620
Sir

12
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,750
I can't restrict the patient's personal freedom

13
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,290
What if the patient

14
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:15,350
suffers second damage?

15
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,570
Can you afford the outcome?

16
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,270
I'm telling you

17
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:19,020
if anything goes wrong I'll sue you

18
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,820
Calm down, sir

19
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,870
Sorry

20
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:37,970
Jingzhi

21
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,250
Where have you been?

22
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,000
I went to pay the fees

23
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,250
How do you feel?

24
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,020
Are you okay?

25
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,400
I haven't done physical examination

26
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,170
How is everything? Say something

27
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:11,970
I heard that someone made a scene in the inpatient ward

28
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,450
and he was gonna sue our hospital

29
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,700
So I have to check it carefully

30
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,550
Dr. Han

31
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:21,020
Am I alright?

32
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,600
Fortunately

33
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,650
Nothing serious

34
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:25,920
Or

35
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,500
someone's gonna go mad

36
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,250
because you suffered brain injury two times in row

37
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,050
Thank you, Dr. Han

38
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,920
Miss Nie,

39
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,250
take care

40
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,570
Don't do fatigue driving again

41
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,100
You're really lucky to be free from any injury this time

42
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:43,240
You're irresponsible for

43
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,600
your life and others' life

44
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,120
Fatigue driving?

45
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,410
Miss Nie has been overwhelmed by work

46
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,820
and less good rest,

47
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,720
so she was absent-minded at that time

48
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,400
with her judgment impaired

49
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,820
It's all my fault

50
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,050
I'm OK now

51
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,370
I didn't feel tired

52
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,270
My mind just wandering

53
00:04:19,270 --> 00:04:20,550
I'll pay attention to it next time

54
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,020
Not again

55
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,370
You're forbidden to drive in the near future

56
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,920
OK, I got it

57
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,200
We'll go home if there's nothing special

58
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:30,820
Okay

59
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,520
I'll drive the car and wait for you downstairs

60
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:34,870
You...

61
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,600
Send her down later

62
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,620
You're so mean

63
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:49,670
Miss Nie

64
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:53,100
Are you busy recently?

65
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,950
As usual

66
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,000
I see

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,300
I'll have a good rest when I'm at home

68
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:04,230
I'm not scolding you

69
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,730
You wanna know what Tong Xin is doing?

70
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,620
She hasn't answered my call for two days

71
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:18,820
You had a quarrel?

72
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,370
Not really

73
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,620
Dr. Han

74
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,920
In a relationship,

75
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,760
if she's always the active one,

76
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,590
she'll feel tired some day

77
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,470
And once she feels tired,

78
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,250
she will bear no hope

79
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,850
Did you get it?

80
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,970
Think about it

81
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:49,900
I gotta go

82
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,520
Don't bother

83
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,870
Is Tong Xin tired of

84
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:08,590
being my fan?

85
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,150
It's getting late

86
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,480
Have a rest

87
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,890
What's wrong?

88
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:36,350
What's wrong?

89
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,470
Did you had a car accident?

90
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:39,790
Kinda of

91
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,990
I'm OK now

92
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,310
Just a scratch

93
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll be better in several days

94
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,300
Why didn't you tell me anything since you are so tired?

95
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,100
I'm not tired

96
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,670
I was just a little distracted

97
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,620
Because of me,

98
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,870
you have no enough time to rest,

99
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,170
so you experienced today's suffering

100
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,510
Xingchen,

101
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,100
we...

102
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,060
Hello, Dr. Zhou

103
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,460
I'm Yan Jingzhi,

104
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,450
I wanna ask

105
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,070
if I have the chance to restore my memory

106
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,950
in a short term

107
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,550
Mr. Yan

108
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,600
Generally, the treatment time is in direct proportion to the course of disease

109
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,850
Your problem can't be solved after

110
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:09,900
one or two treatments

111
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,370
If you have high expectation now,

112
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,320
it may produce the opposite effect

113
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,120
Is it possible for me to suffer memory loss

114
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,750
for the third time during the treatment?

115
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,300
Though it's a negative idea,

116
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,200
it can't be ruled out

117
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,850
OK, I got it

118
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,150
Sorry!

119
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,770
The subscriber you dialed is power off

120
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,320
Where have you been early in the morning?

121
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,450
Here is breakfast for you

122
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,000
What a big ham!

123
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:49,900
Can I have it every day?

124
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,200
Can you act like a rich second generation?

125
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,420
What should a rich second generation look like?

126
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,750
Good morning, everyone

127
00:12:58,770 --> 00:12:59,450
Morning

128
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:00,370
Has Mr. Yan arrived yet?

129
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,470
He's in his office

130
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,350
What are you looking at?

131
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,350
Secretary Nie

132
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,250
A big news

133
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,720
Come on, breaking news!

134
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,170
A big news

135
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:09,900
Hurry up!

136
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,320
Our company's share price hit a record high?

137
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,120
Bigger than that one. Have a look

138
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:13,950
I never expected that

139
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:15,670
Mr. Yan had dinner with Zhen Nian last night

140
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,220
And they were snapshot by paparazzi

141
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:21,870
Mr. Yan wants to get back together with Zhen Nian, doesn't he?

142
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,750
Huang, something's wrong

143
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,020
You ever said Mr. Yan has a

144
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,170
secret girlfriend

145
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:31,150
Mr. Yan's love confession failed

146
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,370
So a man who suffered emotional damage

147
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,350
must find someone loves him

148
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,120
It's human nature

149
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,850
An excellent man like Mr. Yan failed in love confession

150
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:47,400
It's no giggie for me to be crossed in love

151
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,220
Yours failure isn't about love

152
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,420
It's playing house

153
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,320
I'm really serious

154
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,370
Secretary Nie

155
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,740
Do you know some inside information?

156
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:02,090
Just give us more information about it

157
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,420
Guys

158
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,070
It's time for work

159
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,370
You can gossip when you get off work

160
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:21,100
So a man who suffered emotional damage

161
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,470
must find someone loves him

162
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:26,800
It's human nature

163
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,050
Mr. Yan

164
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:38,370
Here are urgent files you need to sign?

165
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,840
You didn't go to Dr. Zhou, did you?

166
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,480
I was really busy so I forgot it

167
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,620
Were you busy having dinner with Zhen Nian?

168
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,900
You were snapshot by the media

169
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:02,350
You can tell me things like this in advance next time

170
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:05,320
I'll cancel your appointment with the doctor as you wish

171
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,020
If you don't want to have dinner at home

172
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,250
I won't make so many dishes

173
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,020
You can call me

174
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,370
or you can just text me

175
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,120
You're mad about the matter between me and Zhen Nian?

176
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,520
I'm not mad

177
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,800
But if... In my memory,

178
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,500
I've known her longer

179
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:21,900
than I've known you

180
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:27,720
Jingzhi

181
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:32,450
You're here

182
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:33,900
Secretary Nie

183
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:35,520
If you have nothing special,

184
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,850
you may leave now

185
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,170
Come here and sit

186
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:43,700
Mr. Yan

187
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,850
Do you think the publicity department is required

188
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:52,750
to deal with the gossip between you and Miss Zhen?

189
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,480
How do you think?

190
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:57,950
We'll meet frequently later

191
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,950
We have to clarify our relationship every time?

192
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,820
Okay

193
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:04,040
Just leave it alone

194
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,370
Jingzhi

195
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,730
Do you see the hashtags

196
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,020
We look so bad

197
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,250
in those pictures

198
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,050
Look

199
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,120
Right?

200
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,820
You really want to do so?

201
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,820
I didn't expect that

202
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,870
you can asked me out

203
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:38,470
and order those dishes for me

204
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,270
I need your help with one thing

205
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,620
It is to do with Nie Xingchen?

206
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,650
As I expected,

207
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,440
you have nothing else needed my help

208
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,740
I just want her to give me up

209
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,520
Why?

210
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:05,850
I can't give her happiness she wants

211
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,150
With these things you did for her,

212
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,500
she's gained the happiness

213
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,470
I won't own for the whole life

214
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,620
I won't drink wine today

215
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,600
You wanna my help?

216
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,220
Well, let's begin with drinking wine

217
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,400
You will regret

218
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,070
Maybe

219
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,370
I hope I'm the one to regret

220
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,840
instead of her

221
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:44,060
You wanna continue to read the contract rather than talking to me?

222
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,310
It's about our company's jewelry endorsement

223
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,080
You'll reach the contract next week

224
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,230
I won't decline it

225
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,580
It's your gift as thanks

226
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:54,780
I deserve it

227
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,230
Come in

228
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,810
Mr. Yan

229
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,880
What's the matter?

230
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,680
It's the report from the Marketing Department

231
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,530
I see

232
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,280
Secretary Nie, you were usually so thoughtful,

233
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,060
till now, you didn't serve me any drink, why?

234
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,210
Sorry, I'm so busy

235
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:21,780
I'll do it

236
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,610
That's OK

237
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,230
I can drink Jingzhi's

238
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,330
I'm off to work

239
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,480
Come on!

240
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:48,080
You're unhappy to see me dictate her to serve me some water?

241
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,680
In the past five years,

242
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,490
they didn't work it out,

243
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,210
so it's also impossible now

244
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:05,630
Nie Xingchen

245
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,410
Be a generous woman

246
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,310
Mr. Yan

247
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,280
Miss Zhen's clothes are spotted,

248
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:15,430
so buy her a new suit

249
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:17,380
The Designing Department will

250
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,910
know her size

251
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:24,960
OK

252
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,130
I'm off to buy it

253
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,250
Miss Zhen, please wait a moment

254
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,880
I'm leaving now, Jingzhi

255
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,660
Go ahead

256
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,580
Don't bother

257
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,410
Miss Zhen,

258
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,210
can I do anything else for you?

259
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,520
I wanna thank you

260
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:02,310
The dress you bought suits me very well

261
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,730
Never mind

262
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,360
You're the spokesperson of our company's former brand

263
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,310
and the Designing Department has your accurate size

264
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,530
So that means when I become your company's

265
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,960
later spokesperson,

266
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,610
you don't have to take my measure again

267
00:21:15,410 --> 00:21:16,180
During this period,

268
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,930
I gotta keep fit

269
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,030
Secretary Nie

270
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,580
See you next time

271
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:22,960
Bye

272
00:21:48,210 --> 00:21:48,680
I...

273
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:50,130
Are you insane?

274
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:54,160
You haven't learned from last time?

275
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:55,690
What do you mean?

276
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:58,480
You know what I mean

277
00:21:59,010 --> 00:21:59,980
I'm warning you

278
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:03,730
stop meddling in the matter between Yan Jingzhi and Xingchen

279
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,110
Does your Xingchen know that

280
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:08,180
you're trying so hard to

281
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,830
protect her happiness behind her back?

282
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,680
Do you need me to pass on your kindness?

283
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:17,560
You know the truth that a good horse will never turn around

284
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,610
to gaze on an old pasture, don't you?

285
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,560
Yes, I do

286
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,560
But Mr. Zhao, you've gone too far

287
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,530
Whether will I turn around

288
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,630
or what will I do

289
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,310
is none of your business

290
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:29,510
None of my business?

291
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,310
You sure?

292
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,660
Since we dated once, we are in relationship now?

293
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,910
You don't hold such old-fashioned idea, do you?

294
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,210
I've got other plans

295
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,680
See you, Mr. Zhao

296
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,910
You have really great strength

297
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,660
to hit my chest

298
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:58,980
Come in

299
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:01,760
Mr. Yan

300
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,760
It's today's minutes of meeting

301
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,510
Put it here

302
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,110
You haven't been off work yet

303
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:12,580
How about Secretary Nie?

304
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:14,330
Secretary Nie

305
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,410
She's long been off duty

306
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,510
You can call on me anytime

307
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,360
It's all right

308
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,180
You can be off work now

309
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,580
You've been waiting for me?

310
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:57,030
I knew you won't come downstairs early,

311
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,480
so I buy you dinner

312
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:00,760
Why didn't you go home first?

313
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,220
I'm afraid you'll hide from me

314
00:24:20,330 --> 00:24:21,080
You aren't angry?

315
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,060
For what?

316
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,270
If you mean the matter between you and Zhen Nian,

317
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,180
I'm not angry

318
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,780
I believe you

319
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,810
Sometimes,

320
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,710
one doesn't need love

321
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,780
but must own friendship

322
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,560
During the five years when you lost your memory,

323
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,530
Zhen Nian was with you

324
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:47,660
So you don't have to explain too much

325
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,180
about things between you to me

326
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:25,880
Have a rest

327
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,680
I'll cook for you

328
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,480
Don't bother

329
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,210
I'm not hungry

330
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,580
Since you're not hungry,

331
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,680
why not write diary with me?

332
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,010
We haven't kept dairies for a long time

333
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,380
I won't do it again

334
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:39,780
Why?

335
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,310
because it's a pointless thing

336
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,810
and it just wastes our time

337
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,830
How can it be pointless?

338
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,460
If you lose your memory again...

339
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,480
If I lose my memory again,

340
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,710
will I fall in love with you again

341
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,010
by a dairy?

342
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,680
No on-off button is built into my love,

343
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,010
so I can't turn it on and off at will

344
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,310
Jingzhi

345
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:08,090
Last time, Dr. Zhou called me,

346
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,280
telling me you were emotional

347
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,610
and under great pressure

348
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,060
You can tell me your concerns

349
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,380
Even though we can't solve them,

350
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,130
I can share your suffering

351
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:19,730
I have no concerns

352
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:22,060
I just need some personal space

353
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:23,910
I don't want to be forced to see a doctor

354
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,710
and recall the past every day

355
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,210
Jingzhi

356
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,860
You didn't got disease

357
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,880
I didn't force you

358
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,860
It doesn't matter if you can recall nothing

359
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,110
What if my amnesia won't be

360
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:43,410
cured forever?

361
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:47,130
Well, we can be in love again and again

362
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,310
Anyhow, you'll fall in love with me every time

363
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:51,030
What if I don't fall in love with you?

364
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,260
Then I'll try harder to

365
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,610
make it an instinct for you to love me

366
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:07,310
One can lose memory thousands of times,

367
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,210
but he can't be against his instinct

368
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,370
Never mind

369
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:24,460
If you don't want keep dairies,

370
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,110
I'll do it for you

371
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,730
I make it a souvenir

372
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:55,410
Are you insane?

373
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:55,980
Yes

374
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,280
Yes!

375
00:27:58,710 --> 00:27:59,530
I don't know when my amnesia will

376
00:27:59,530 --> 00:28:00,580
come back again?

377
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,630
I feel that my head is like a huge stone

378
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:04,230
and it can fall at any time

379
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,330
I would rather give up such love

380
00:28:06,630 --> 00:28:08,210
if I'll live in an agonizing life

381
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,110
in my remaining years

382
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,770
What do you mean?

383
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,430
I want to be a normal people

384
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,080
and live a normal life

385
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,180
I don't want to lose my memory again and again

386
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,260
Nie Xingchen

387
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,010
we...

388
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,560
You're really emotional now

389
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,010
We'll talk later when you calm down

390
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:41,210
I would rather give up such love

391
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,780
if I'll live in an agonizing life

392
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,760
in my remaining years

393
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,980
I want to be a normal people

394
00:29:47,330 --> 00:29:48,680
and live a normal life

395
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,660
I don't want to lose my memory again and again

396
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:27,980
Sister Xingchen

397
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,080
It's the investment report of Marketing Department

398
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,960
They hope Mr. Yan can check and approve it asap

399
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:32,880
Okay

400
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,680
Tong Xin

401
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:42,720
Can you do me a favor?

402
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,630
Mr. Yan

403
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,660
It's the investment report of Accounting Department

404
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:52,480
Put it here

405
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,260
And

406
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,860
Xingchen let me tell you

407
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:59,580
the video meeting held by the headquarter in U.S.

408
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,580
is scheduled in today's 3:00 p.m.

409
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,680
Is that OK?

410
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,160
What's wrong?

411
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,760
Mr. Yan wants the list of participants

412
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,110
and the meeting topic

413
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:14,860
Mr. Yan

414
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,580
Give me the contract

415
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,480
Mr. Yan

416
00:32:22,530 --> 00:32:23,560
And the agenda

417
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,260
Mr. Yan

418
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,030
It's the agenda list of the meeting

419
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:31,270
Xingchen said you can call on me

420
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:32,410
at any time

421
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,660
when you need help

422
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,460
It's all right

423
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,460
You may leave now

424
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:54,960
Hello

425
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,030
OK, I got it

426
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:15,280
Secretary Nie

427
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,630
Go somewhere with me this afternoon

428
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,010
I have work to do this afternoon

429
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,330
Let Secretary Tong go with you

430
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:23,660
Mrs. Liao had an accident

431
00:33:58,710 --> 00:33:59,430
Mr. Liao

432
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,130
Restrain your grief

433
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:22,180
Thank you for allowing me to

434
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,020
come here with Yunhua for the last time

435
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,330
Yunhua,

436
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,310
you're being naughty again

437
00:34:40,710 --> 00:34:41,660
I've told you that

438
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,700
I'll bring you here again

439
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:48,810
Why did you come here alone secretly?

440
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:51,510
We've made a deal

441
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,880
that we'll come here together

442
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:00,610
But you left me behind

443
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,110
Mr. Liao

444
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,680
Mrs. Liao doesn't want to

445
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:13,930
see you like this

446
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,610
You know what

447
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,180
Before madam's death,

448
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,680
I think she might recognized me

449
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,480
Lying there, she was looking at me

450
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,330
Though she didn't say anything,

451
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,430
I know

452
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:41,830
she was feeling sorry for

453
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,750
forgetting our past

454
00:35:49,810 --> 00:35:51,160
Everyone thinks that

455
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,560
one who forgets would be much happier

456
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:58,060
and one who remember will suffer great grief

457
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,180
But it's not the case in fact

458
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,510
One who forgets will be much more desirable

459
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:08,960
because she forgets

460
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:12,380
all happiness and sweetness in her life

461
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,520
and she lives a gloomy life

462
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,310
All she could do is

463
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:23,730
grab the a ray of light

464
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:27,080
in her memory

465
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,610
Excuse me,

466
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,330
I'd like to stay alone for a while

467
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:48,580
Okay

468
00:36:48,910 --> 00:36:50,360
We'll wait for you outside

469
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:51,830
You can call us when you need help

470
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,830
Thank you

471
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:56,710
Let go!

472
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:23,510
I want to be a normal people

473
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:25,060
and live a normal life

474
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,810
I don't want to lose my memory again and again

475
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,630
I pissed Xingchen off today

476
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:24,980
I was with Zhen Nian deliberately, making her get me wrong

477
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,760
I deliberately tore her notepad, making her embarrassed

478
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,180
Everything I've done is to

479
00:40:32,810 --> 00:40:34,720
let her give me up

480
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:39,330
But that stupid girl said

481
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,690
she believed me

482
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,960
and it doesn't matter if I forget her again

483
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,680
And we can go together over and over again

484
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:49,730
because I'll fall in love with her every time

485
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:55,410
But I love her deeply,

486
00:40:57,410 --> 00:40:59,610
I don't want to get her hurt

487
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:01,280
because of my repeating memory loss

488
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,110
If she didn't meet me,

489
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,010
she would be much happier

490
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,580
So Xingchen,

491
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,500
I don't want to forget you this time,

492
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,480
and I want to leave you

493
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,830
Sorry

494
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:16,480
What's going on?

495
00:42:20,310 --> 00:42:21,110
Mr. Yan

496
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:24,480
Miss Nie arrived at the company early this morning

497
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,430
and she asked us to give this to you

498
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,230
Where is she now?

499
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,230
She packed her stuff and

500
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:38,580
then she left

501
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:46,830
Is there something wrong in Xingchen's family?

502
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:48,310
It's all of sudden

503
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,410
I have no idea

504
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:51,610
Huang,

505
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:53,510
why didn't you get to the root of the matter?

506
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:55,510
You could stop her

507
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,610
Alright

508
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,230
Why are you all blaming me?

509
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,130
When I arrived at the company,

510
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:02,710
Miss Nie had long packed her stuff up

511
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,110
She handed me her letter of resignation

512
00:43:04,110 --> 00:43:04,980
and then left

513
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,060
I had no time to ask her

514
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:07,660
It appears to be my fault

515
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,810
Because of emotional entanglement?

516
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:11,310
I don't know

517
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:17,860
Go to work

518
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,530
Xingchen,

519
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:48,960
Sorry!

520
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:51,510
The subscriber you dialed is power off

521
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,210
Jingzhi

522
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,110
Sorry

523
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,840
I'll give you up again this time

524
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,760
Yesterday's matter let me realize that

525
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:13,260
memory loss means a

526
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:15,880
huge disaster for you

527
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:20,060
I don't want you to be another Mrs. Liao

528
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:22,510
because of memory loss

529
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,680
I don't want you to pursue a ray of light in your life

530
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,230
at an expense of your life

531
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:34,730
I don't want you to forget me again

532
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,310
Though we can't go together in the future

533
00:44:40,830 --> 00:44:42,530
Let me be selfish this time

534
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:45,830
I'll leave Jinghai

535
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:48,160
You don't have to look for me

536
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:51,960
I believe

537
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,410
time will heal everything

538
00:44:54,510 --> 00:44:57,810
one day

539
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,780
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,

540
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:35,430
How I wonder what you are!

541
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:41,830
Twinkle, twinkle, little star,

542
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:47,880
How I wonder what you are!

543
00:45:48,430 --> 00:45:54,380
Up above the world so high

544
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,710
What are you doing?

545
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,680
I just want her to serve me a glass of water

546
00:46:13,690 --> 00:46:14,660
You're unhappy?

547
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:28,860
Jingzhi

548
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,110
Tell her

549
00:46:31,230 --> 00:46:32,680
you messed up my clothes

550
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,130
and let her buy me a new suit

551
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:35,750
Are you insane?

552
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,730
You want her to leave you, do you?

553
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:41,260
If I just spend the afternoon standing here stupidly,

554
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,780
you can't hit the mark

555
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,080
You're on purpose

556
00:46:44,330 --> 00:46:45,110
That's right

557
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,410
I can't vent my spleen

558
00:46:47,410 --> 00:46:48,560
unless I take revenge on her

559
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:50,260
You acted on your own

560
00:46:50,780 --> 00:46:51,980
I'll deduct money from your contract

561
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:55,410
You can directly say you feel sorry about her

562
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,410
Go ahead, Mr. Yan

563
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,680
In order to avoid goof,

564
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:04,310
you should take the new clothes to me in personal later

565
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:07,860
Come on

566
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:15,580
OK, let's switch roles

567
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:16,960
I'll tell her I messed your clothes up

568
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,780
No

569
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:18,760
I'll go

570
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:25,130
Great

571
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,930
You really have a hard time
