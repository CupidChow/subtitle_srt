1
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:23,120
Zhao Yuanfang

2
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,950
You have 30 seconds left

3
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:24,930
If you're not dying,

4
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,850
just hang up right now

5
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,230
It's over

6
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,910
The car that picked up the partner's boss has broken down on the road

7
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,150
None of my business

8
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:32,760
How long does it take to land?

9
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,410
Half an hour

10
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,310
I'll pick you

11
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,500
When drinking tea,

12
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:56,180
you should peaceful

13
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:57,830
and set the heart at rest

14
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,980
Same as being human

15
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,020
Nothing's more important than drinking tea

16
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,940
Don't worry about anything

17
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,690
Take it easy

18
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,070
Hello

19
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,590
Welcome to take the Adi car

20
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:11,660
Excuse me, are you going to the airport?

21
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:12,680
Hold on, sir

22
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:13,510
Well

23
00:03:13,570 --> 00:03:14,460
Go straight

24
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,280
Passing by a square

25
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:15,890
Then turn right

26
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,500
Driving by the river

27
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,320
Then go straight again

28
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,650
Try to avoid all congested section

29
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:19,870
directly arrive at NO 2. terminal

30
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:20,590
Gate ladder 6

31
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,190
Be quick sir

32
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,160
Sir

33
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:32,620
Please put down the rear-view mirror

34
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:33,660
What's wrong?

35
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:35,280
l need to change my clothes

36
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:36,550
OK

37
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:07,730
Mr. Yan

38
00:04:07,850 --> 00:04:09,310
The company's car should have arrived

39
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,990
Yuanda's driver should be late

40
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,720
We arrived ten minutes ahead of time

41
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:17,910
Not to be late

42
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,440
What is the total number of

43
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,350
users of Yuanda's strategic products?

44
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,790
Almost 100 million

45
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,250
Almost?

46
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:33,070
It's 97,875,600

47
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:34,210
How about the ratio of men to women?

48
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,970
It's 67.5 and 32.5

49
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,590
Yes, yes

50
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,320
That's right

51
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,820
You can go back

52
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,360
You are not suitable to be my secretary

53
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,560
You will no longer be an employee of Bojue

54
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,600
Mr. Yan

55
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,450
Give me one more chance please!

56
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,330
I never give others a second chance

57
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:55,350
There is only one reason for not being good enough

58
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,680
that is you're not working hard enough

59
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,960
Please enjoy it

60
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,010
He

61
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,590
can be called a business legend

62
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:23,250
In just a few years, he turned the Bojue Group

63
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,320
into the world's top 500 multinational groups

64
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,870
Although he's young, he is very outstanding

65
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,730
What's his name?

66
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,390
Yan Jingzhi

67
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,900
I send you his photo

68
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,650
No

69
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,840
I saw him

70
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,160
Mr. Yan

71
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:56,810
Mr. Yan

72
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,240
I made it

73
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,550
I made it, I made it

74
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,760
Traffic jam

75
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:02,870
My god

76
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:04,470
Mr. Yan

77
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:05,750
traffic jams are serious

78
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,380
In order to catch you

79
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,140
I left on car there

80
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:09,470
and run to here

81
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,470
You're

82
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,790
director of President Office of Bojue

83
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,040
Huang Tao

84
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,850
Where is the people from Yuanda?

85
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:19,870
Yuanda?

86
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,560
Ah

87
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,020
They probably also be blocked on the way

88
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,210
and run to here

89
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,130
I came here first

90
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,000
Really

91
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,660
Girl,

92
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,750
You got the wrong person

93
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,410
What? What?

94
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:30,210
Be careful

95
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:30,810
No

96
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,480
Got the wrong person?

97
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,100
What's up?

98
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,600
I don't know her!

99
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:34,200
Eh

100
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,120
Mr. Yan

101
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,810
I'm General Secretary of Mr. Zhao

102
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:38,610
My name is Nie

103
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,600
Welcome to Jinghai

104
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:43,230
Secretary Nie

105
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,640
President Zhao prepared a banquet for you

106
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,010
to welcome you

107
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,120
I hope you can attend

108
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,090

109
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,800
Secretary Nie

110
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:00,400

00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,290

112
00:07:01,290 --> 00:07:02,180
and help me recognize the direction

113
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,270
Take on your clothes

114
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,420
So hot!

115
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,400
I run to here

116
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,270
Mr. Yan

117
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,180
You don't look well

118
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,030
Is hypoglycemia caused motion sickness?

119
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,840
I have some candy here

120
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,290
How do you know I have hypoglycemia?

121
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:47,520
My friend is

122
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,090
the same as you

123
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,620
Pineapple flavored

124
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:01,680
Thanks

125
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,010
You're welcome

126
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:10,720
Mr. Yan

127
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,900
Is the temperature of the air conditioner right?

128
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:15,830
Switch to double

129
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,930
Mr. Yan! Mr. Yan!

130
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,670
I've heard a lot about you

131
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,430

00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,670
Well done

135
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,120
Hurry up and buy me some chaser

136
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,110
We have to finish it tonight

137
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:23,500
Come on

138
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,320
Don't talk much

139
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,370
Cheers

140
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,120
Cheers!

141
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,380
Mr. Yan. Come on!

142
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,370
Did the cup, we are friends

143
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:31,920
Sorry!

144
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,920
I don't drink

145
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,750
How can you do business in Jinghai

146
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:39,210
without drinking?

147
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,050
Trust me

148
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,680
drinking could improve relationship

149
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:42,340
Come on

150
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,230
Drink it

151
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:43,730
Add to the fun

152
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,010
Mr. Huang

153
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,630
I can drink for him

154
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:54,280
Come on

155
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,180
Excuse me

156
00:10:09,990 --> 00:10:10,380
Mr. Yan

157
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,100
Your medicine

158
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,050
The doctor said that one pill after a meal

159
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:14,920
three times a day

160
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,480
While taking pills

161
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,320
you cannot drink alcohol

162
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,030
Are you ill?

163
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,870
You can't drink alcohol while taking medicine

164
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:26,280
Come on

165
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:26,840
Mr. Huang

166
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,130
I'll drink with you

167
00:10:28,190 --> 00:10:28,980
I'll drink with you

168
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,190
People with wine

169
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:31,030
Come on!

170
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,240
Let's drink

171
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,730
I'll go outside

172
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:35,710
Cheers

173
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,510
Mr. Li drinks too little

174
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:43,280
Mr. Li drinks too little

175
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:01,480
Mr. Yan

176
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,330
Mr. Zhao drinks too much

177
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,470
so he can't send you

178
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:05,540
Secretary Nie

179
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:07,130
What's your full name?

180
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:09,960
Nie Xingchen

181
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,390
Chen from Liangchenmeijing (beautiful scene on a bright day)?

182
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:15,820
Yeah

183
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,230
What about the medicine?

184
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,460
My throat has become inflamed recently

185
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,090
So

186
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,850
I thought you work miracles

187
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:28,110
and know I don't drink

188
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,290
so prepare it deliberately

189
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,020
Just a coincidence

190
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,490
You have worked in Yuanda for five years

191
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,070
That's right

192
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,560
Do you have any interest in changing a company?

193
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,590
Mr. Yan, what do you mean?

194
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,240
I returned to Jinghai this time to expand the market

195
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,480
I need an assistant who

196
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,070
knows all companies in Jinghai

197
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:48,940
And

198
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,820
the position of my secretary is void

199
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:53,560
Mr. Yan

200
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,590
Your action of cutting the ground from under others feet

201
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:56,260
seems to be inappropriate

202
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,250
What's your conditions?

203
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,890
Just say it

204
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,790
I have no conditions

205
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,650
Because I won't change jobs

206
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,710
I can let you be my Chief Secretary

207
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,280
Salary doubled from your present

208
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,650
I won't change my job for

209
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,080
Double

210
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,310
Mr. Yan

211
00:12:10,390 --> 00:12:10,840
Triple

212
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,550
Mr. Yan, can you listen to my reasons?

213
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,070
That's not a matter of money

214
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,090
Soon after graduation

215
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,200
I have entered Yuanda

216
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,250
and have grown up with this company

217
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,380
For me

218
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,170
Yuanda is like my home

219
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,750
Maybe

220
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,260
You should move on now

221
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,870
I believe that our cooperation will be very happy

222
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:35,590
Jinghai is abundance of talented people

223
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,210
I believe

224
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,490
you could find someone more suitable than me

225
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:43,940
I've already found it

226
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:46,800
Salary triple from your present

227
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,990
Year-end awards, bonuses, houses, vehicles

228
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,010
All provide by company

229
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,950
15 days of paid leave per year

230
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,300
You can go anywhere on the map

231
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,230
The company will reimburse it

232
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,210
I believe no one could reject this

233
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,250
kind of conditions

234
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,160
It seems that Mr. Yan doesn't know me very well

235
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,150
Secretary Nie

236
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,190
I know

237
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,470
sometimes rejection is

238
00:13:06,470 --> 00:13:08,170
a way to increase chips

239
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,780
But everything has its limitation

240
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:10,850
Overdone is worse than undone

241
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:14,590
Mr. Yan

242
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,430
The car picking you up has arrived

243
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,440
Please

244
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:18,990
OK

245
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:21,310
I will give you twenty-four hours to consider

246
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,380
Mr. Yan

247
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,530
Mr. Yan

248
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:37,240
No. thanks

249
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,640
I can answer you now

250
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,530
Thank you for your appreciation

251
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,950
But l still refused it

252
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,440
My rejection is not for increasing the chips

253
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,850
and no other meanings

254
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,780
Hope you can just understand this

255
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,380
word directly

256
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:52,830
I believe

257
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,100
you would surly change your mind

258
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,400
Mr. Yan, your bag

259
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,280
Rosemary

260
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:11,720
Mr. Yan

261
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,150
Sorry

262
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,890
That's my fault

263
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,890
Have we met before?

264
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,460
No

265
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,850
We met for the first time today

266
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,200
Have a good night, Mr. Yan!

267
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,790
Hello

268
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:41,930
Ziyu

269
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:43,790
I dreamed about her again

270
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,830
It has been four years since the last dream

271
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,600
This dream

272
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:50,080
is more clear

273
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:53,360
Is it

274
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,650
a precursor to memory recovery?

275
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:59,050
Did you know any new people today

276
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:00,920
Mr. Yan

277
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,640
I'm General Secretary of Mr. Zhao

278
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:03,470
My name is Nie

279
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,190
Welcome to Jinghai

280
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:06,790
Yes

281
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,640
That's should be she stimulated your nerves

282
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,250
I got it

283
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,040
After I'm busy, I'll go find you

284
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,410
Nie Xingchen

285
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,070
How could it be him?

286
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:20,310
Mr. Yan

287
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,590
The Quwo from Yuanda

288
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,630
is one of the best

289
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,230
short video social software

290
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,070
If Yuanda could

291
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:28,460
achieve a strategic cooperation with Bojue

292
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:29,820
and exploit the overseas market together

293
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,430
I believe

294
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,050
Mr. Zhao

295
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:32,580
I have a new suggestion

296
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:34,380
Speak

297
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,590
I want to acquire Yuanda

298
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:39,270
Mr. Yan

299
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:40,780
We don't have this plan

300
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,810
Are you kidding me, Mr. Yan?

301
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:51,950
Name your price

302
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:54,090
Mr. Yan

303
00:17:54,570 --> 00:17:55,950
Although Yuanda is not as good as Bojue

304
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,060
it is also

305
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,390
a promising company

306
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,230
200 million

307
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:01,100
That's not a matter of money

308
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,340
Employees choose us Yuanda

309
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,600
are out of turst

310
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,460
Salaries of all employees rose by 20%

311
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,540
Mr. Yan

312
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,930
Yuanda is my five years of hard work

313
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:19,620
I allow you to keep 20% of the shares

314
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,020
and keep operate Yuanda's products

315
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:28,590
Deal

316
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:37,750
Mr. Zhao

317
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,270
One last condition

318
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,070
Please

319
00:18:42,610 --> 00:18:43,690
There must be no shortage

320
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:47,950
of employees

321
00:18:51,650 --> 00:18:52,620
OK

322
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,300
Including me

323
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:05,510
Mr. Yan

324
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,300
Have a cordial working relationship

325
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,060
Have a cordial working relationship

326
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:07,770
I'll see you out

327
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:08,750
No, thanks

328
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,470
Secretary Nie is ok

329
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:14,950
Xingchen

330
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,010
Ok, Mr. Zhao

331
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:26,950
Bye bye

332
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,530
Yan Jingzhi promised to be so refreshing

333
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,990
Should I ask for more money?

334
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,510
Mr. Zhao

335
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,890
We sold ourselves

336
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:40,910
What is selling?

337
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,120
We're entering them

338
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,130
Spread the word

339
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,610
Tomorrow we will move to the Bojue Mansion

340
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,390
I'll prepare it

341
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:51,970
OK

342
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,320
Quickly

343
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,450
Do you have anything to say?

344
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,280
Mr. Yan

345
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,730
Why did you suddenly buy Yuanda?

346
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,180
You do not have guessed?

347
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,310
It should not be the reason I guessed

348
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,960
You don't have to look down on yourself

349
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,290
I'm doing this for you

350
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:17,950
Why?

351
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:18,840
I'm curious

352
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,200
About what?

353
00:20:20,230 --> 00:20:22,380
How do you know I have hypoglycemia?

354
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,280
I'm just guessing

355
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,200
You are a big customer of our company

356
00:20:27,490 --> 00:20:29,750
Naturally, I will pay special attention to your feelings

357
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,470
Then why do you know

358
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,850
I like pineapple candy?

359
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,250
I don't know

360
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,340
Just because I like it

361
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,720
So it’s a coincidence that you know I don’t drink

362
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,100
I just had two bottles of water in front of me in the meeting room

363
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:45,700
It's a coincidence too

364
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:50,150
So it’s a coincidence that you know I like rosemary

365
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,540
After I found it yesterday,

366
00:20:56,050 --> 00:20:57,420
you changed your shampoo

367
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,600
Is it still a coincidence?

368
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,370
What do you really want to ask?

369
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,580
Did we know each other before?

370
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,750
I have already told you,

371
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,140
yesterday was the first time we met

372
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,350
Do I have the necessity to cheat you about it?

373
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,450
Besides,

374
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:18,360
if we truly know each other before,

375
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,210
how could you forget about it?

376
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,760
I'll know it sooner or later

377
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,800
Register in the President Office tomorrow

378
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,360
My

379
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:32,610
Chief Secretary

380
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,110
Good morning, Miss Ailu

381
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,700
Good morning

382
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:10,720
What's wrong?

383
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,120
Why are you so downcast in the morning?

384
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,500
Miss Ailu

385
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:14,490
Check this out

386
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:15,740
They printed our J logo

387
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,760
like this

388
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,620
Like being shot

389
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,760
It's not good at all

390
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,030
Look at you

391
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,470
Shouting like this

392
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:23,890
Anyway

393
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,920
Yesterday my J made a new song

394
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,030
His voice is so nice

395
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,820
I almost cried

396
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,700
Well

397
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,240
You just like him too much

398
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,470
Do I?

399
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:34,610
Sun Yang

400
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,230
Yesterday my J made a new song

401
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:36,870
Have you listened?

402
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:37,580
How?

403
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,990
J's new song, I...

404
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,320
Why do you ask him?

405
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,410
He just knows Erhu and zither

406
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,400
How could he know the new song?

407
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,830
Why didn't I know?

408
00:22:44,830 --> 00:22:45,250
Ailu

409
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,560
Give me the charging line

410
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:46,920
Hurry up

411
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:49,960
Can you take a charging line by yourself?

412
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,820
Come to the company everyday to use my things

413
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,460
Take what?

414
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,170
I'm losing

415
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:54,250
Jin Dongxu

416
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,360
My J made a new song yesterday

417
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,010
Have you listened?

418
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,110
Is it melodious?

419
00:22:58,850 --> 00:22:59,500
Yes, I did

420
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,740
You say it's good then it's good

421
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:03,450
Sun Yang, what were you trying to say?

422
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:05,250
I said that actually...

423
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:14,910
I'll check it

424
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,080
Uncle Huang

425
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,050
Little Tong Xin

426
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,956
I'm in good health

427
00:23:21,970 --> 00:23:23,150
Don't call me uncle

428
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:24,360
You should called me brother

429
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,050
Believe or not

430
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:25,860
I'll make you be a trainee again

431
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,400
Clean the table now

432
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,340
OK. OK. Don't be mad

433
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:30,940
Brother Huang

434
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:31,970
Don't be mad

435
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,450
Take it easy

436
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,170
What's the matter with in such an early morning?

437
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:36,890
The boss told you off?

438
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,660
I'm willing to

439
00:23:39,810 --> 00:23:40,760
I'm telling you

440
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,190
The position of Chief Secretary

441
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,440
I certainly will get it

442
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,350
Don't rob me

443
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:47,510
The boss won't like you

444
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,430
Give my charging line back to me

445
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,260
Miss Ailu

446
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,570
Our boss is Thanos in secretary field

447
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,980
He snapped his fingers and lots of secretaries disappeared

448
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,900
He has fired three secretaries this month

449
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,800
We dare not to compete with you

450
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,500
It's important to save our lives

451
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:02,770
Director, you are fine

452
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,140
Tong Xin

453
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:04,970
Your life

454
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,450
I'll punch you

455
00:24:06,490 --> 00:24:08,540
Can you let me finish my word?

456
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:10,760
Director Huang

457
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,830
The Chief Secretary

458
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,820
Chief Secretary

459
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,510
You don't need to fight for it

460
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,790
The company hired it

461
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:17,410
What?

462
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,370
Hired?

463
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,200
Where?

464
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:20,920
Who?

465
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,180
Hello everyone

466
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,790
I'm Nie Xingchen

467
00:24:33,270 --> 00:24:34,780
This is Mr. Yan's office

468
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:36,180
But he is not here this morning

469
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,730
Most of the time

470
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:38,880
you should work here

471
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:39,460
But

472
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:41,060
the President Office also reserved your seat

473
00:24:41,350 --> 00:24:41,800
By the way

474
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:42,890
My name is Tong Xin

475
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,850
I just changed from an intern

476
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,880
What else, you can ask me

477
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,180
I mean it's OK to ask me

478
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,280
Not at the moment

479
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:53,860
Thank you

480
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:54,930
Well

481
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,470
By the way

482
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,290
have you known Mr. Yan before?

483
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:58,970
We didn't know each other before

484
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,000
We met for the first time yesterday

485
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,390
OK

486
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,760
I'll prepare for it

487
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,420
Yes, yes

488
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,240
Then get to your own business first

489
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:07,980
I'll leave

490
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:21,150
That's it

491
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:21,850
This barbecue is delicious

492
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,120
OK

493
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,760
Yes. We went there before

494
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,110
Director

495
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,420
We go to eat barbecue rice at noon

496
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:26,040
Together?

497
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:26,870
No

498
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,920
It is greasy

499
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,010
and aging at an accelerated rate of skin

500
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,430
Get me one please

501
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,310
You have not given my money for your lunch last week

502
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:34,640
Next time

503
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:36,560
Are you going to have a lunch?

504
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,520
We...

505
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,510
Then what time is work in the afternoon?

506
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,720
Two o'clock

507
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,780
OK, thanks

508
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,880
Miss Ailu

509
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,710
It's at half-past one

510
00:25:57,710 --> 00:25:59,310
It's not good for us to lie to her like that

511
00:25:59,340 --> 00:25:59,780
Yeah

512
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,260
What's wrong with that?

513
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,620
Chief Secretary is not choosing from us

514
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,750
This is not to make a face?

515
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,090
It means our abilities are unqualified

516
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,190
What's more

517
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,170
If she's really that capable,

518
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,920
it's not easy for her to be cheated

519
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:18,420
Ailu

520
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,190
My treat

521
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:29,480
I bring you some cake

522
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,640
No one wants?

523
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:42,620
The record holder in Yuanda who has never been late for five consecutive years

524
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,870
The first day,

525
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,900
you had a twenty-eight minutes late

526
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:48,600
Secretary Nie

527
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,870
Are you challenging me?

528
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,210
Sorry, Mr. Yan

529
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:54,630
Reason?

530
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:07,890
No reason

531
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,560
That's my fault

532
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,040
It won't happen again

533
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,630
Generous

534
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:28,650
So generous

535
00:27:31,910 --> 00:27:32,530
Ah

536
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,520
Let's eat the cake

537
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,010
OK.

538
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:36,930
Let’s have the cake

539
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,280
It’s half past one

540
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:55,790
Miss Ailu

541
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:56,940
Coffee is coming

542
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:57,890
Thanks

543
00:27:58,410 --> 00:28:01,330
In fact, I think Miss Xingchen is quite good

544
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,330
Xingchen, here!

545
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,010
A piece of cake bought you off?

546
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,230
Let me tell you something

547
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,920
She is trying to please us on purpose

548
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,150
If there is nothing else,

549
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,740
why did she do this?

550
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,750
By the way,

551
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,400
I heard that

552
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:15,750
Mr. Yan acquired Yuanda company in order to poach her

553
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,210
Tell me this is funny

554
00:28:17,770 --> 00:28:19,330
She didn't know what kind of tricks she was playing

555
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,540
What's up?

556
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:22,770
I don't drink milk

557
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,600
Miss Xingchen

558
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,340
Thank you

559
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,190
You're welcome

560
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,890
This model of your shoes just came out this month, right?

561
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,290
I've looked for several stores and none of them are available

562
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,940
You know this?

563
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,880
I asked a friend to buy it for me

564
00:28:48,610 --> 00:28:50,110
The new model is just beautiful

565
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,110
However, this shoe type is quite selective for those who try it

566
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,240
I don't think I can wear it

567
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,180
Well

568
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,320
You are right

569
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,070
My feet are neat

570
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,120
like this

571
00:28:58,220 --> 00:29:00,220
People call this as Egyptian foot

572
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,090
It is very suitable for wearing high heels

573
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:03,520
No wonder

574
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,429
This new model matched your outfit

575
00:29:06,610 --> 00:29:08,872
It's really a beautiful scenery of the office today

576
00:29:08,887 --> 00:29:10,625
The scenery is far from ideal

577
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,080
There is one line here indeed

578
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,860
I'm not kidding

579
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:16,000
The whole company knows that

580
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,400
I am on the frontline

581
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:20,700
Lulu

582
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:22,160
Can I call you that?

583
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,110
Of course

584
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,760
Can you recommend me a coffee?

585
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:26,710
I think

586
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,360
Mr. Yan will definitely like your taste

587
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,690
You are right!

588
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:31,510
Come on

589
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:32,470
Let me tell you something

590
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:34,250
Everyone in the company knows about it

591
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,670
He always drinks only one coffee

592
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,680
Add only three sugars

593
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,530
It’s sweet just as he wants

594
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,480
She doesn't know

595
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:41,120
I know

596
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,330
Why didn't I know?

597
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,830
Do you want these shoes?

598
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,250
I'll send you the card of the purchasing agent

599
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,030
We haven't added WeChat yet

600
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:48,650
Yes

601
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:49,370
Come on, let’s add it! Come on!

602
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:49,960
Add it by scanning the QR code

603
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:51,970
You tell her

604
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,830
Be sure to mention my name

605
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:53,600
She will give you a discount

606
00:29:57,950 --> 00:29:58,490
Please come in

607
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:05,030
Mr. Yan

608
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,430
Your afternoon tea

609
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,130
I called your former secretary

610
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,060
She told me that

611
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:14,250
you have afternoon tea at three o'clock

612
00:30:19,290 --> 00:30:20,230
The heat is over

613
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:22,480
I know

614
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,310
Your daily calories are controlled at

615
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,610
about 2,300 calories

616
00:30:26,030 --> 00:30:27,060
Afternoon tea must be controlled at

617
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,270
within 100 calories

618
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:30,700
So I chose oatmeal

619
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,780
It’s low-calorie biscuits

620
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,550
The total heat is 50 calories

621
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:34,990
It’s safe to eat

622
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,450
Since Secretary Nie is so careful,

623
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,840
why are you late for lunch?

624
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:50,580
It's me who didn't make it clear

625
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,900
Whether you didn't make it clear

626
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,880
or you pretended to confused?

627
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,780
A wise

628
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:58,100
and flawless man

629
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,760
People will definitely be jealous of him

630
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,510
and stay at a respectful distance from him

631
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:03,930
I don't get it

632
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,660
You got promoted,

633
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:08,660
other colleagues would definitely discontent with you

634
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,880
And you just made mistakes at will

635
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,480
With my critiques,

636
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,240
you can get close with other colleagues

637
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,750
Secretary Nie is a real elite in the workplace

638
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,400
I'm flattered, Mr. Yan

639
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,430
Since you're such a capable lady

640
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,190
How about I give you another task?

641
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,530
I just returned from abroad

642
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,820
I don't even have time to clean my new house

643
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,350
So, please help me with the cleanup work of my new house

644
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,660
I'll stay there overnight

645
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:54,970
No problem! Boss

646
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,450
Hello, Mr. Yan

647
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,420
Secretary Nie

648
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,110
How do you know

649
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,200
I have a habit of reading astronomical magazines before going to bed

650
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,250
I saw some books on the desk in your office

651
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,250
So I bought it

652
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,390
Mr. Yan

653
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:24,320
Is the arrangement of the house satisfactory?

654
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:25,330
I am very satisfied

655
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,690
From tomorrow on,

656
00:35:27,790 --> 00:35:29,500
you are responsible for my daily life and diet

657
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,690
You must come to my house before 7:30

658
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,120
I'll double your salary again

659
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:35,180
In addition

660
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,740
Never be late

661
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,260
Mr. Yan, I always want to…

662
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,540
Okay, it's getting late

663
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,370
Let’s call it a day!

664
00:35:45,530 --> 00:35:47,760
I want to resign!

665
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:39,750
Good morning! Mr. Yan

666
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,350
This is the suit for you today

667
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,030
Good job!

668
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,330
Is breakfast satisfactory?

669
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:51,760
Yes!

670
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,230
Then I'll report it to you

671
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,640
today's work schedule

672
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,000
The executive's meeting

673
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,520
will be started at 10:00

674
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,590
At 11:00

675
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,590
The strategy department will come over

676
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:05,440
to report the current operation of the company

677
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:07,120
We will attend a Party for Turing 100-day-old at noon

678
00:38:07,150 --> 00:38:08,680
for the daughter of Wanjia's CEO

679
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,500
I have already prepared the gift for you

680
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,390
Mr. Yan, don't you wash up?

681
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,980
I'll play music for you

682
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,750
This music is very suitable for your mood today

683
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:28,400
Sure!

684
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,140
Let me iron your suit

685
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,000
[Resignation apply submitted]

686
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,390
Mr. Yan? Mr. Yan? Mr. Yan?

687
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:45,760
Ah

688
00:39:45,770 --> 00:39:48,400
Did Xingchen do well these days?

689
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,420
Good job!

690
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,890
That's good! Good!

691
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:51,990
Xingchen's ability

692
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,460
to work is actually quite strong

693
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,320
But she is a little stubborn

694
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,690
If she has done anything wrong,

695
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:57,860
I hope you can tolerate her

696
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:58,950
You are overthinking

697
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,000
By her character,

698
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,600
she can't do anything wrong

699
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,630
Then I'm relieved

700
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
[Resignation apply pending approval]

701
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,300
Am I saying to the point?

702
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:48,310
Secretary Nie

703
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,340
Director Huang

704
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,800
What’s this?

705
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,810
This document

706
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:54,770
is urgent

707
00:40:55,490 --> 00:40:56,660
I need you

708
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,130
send it to YunTeng personally

709
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,140
YunTeng is in the east area

710
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:02,730
I'm afraid it will take me two hours to get there

711
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:04,440
Take a taxi

712
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,200
You can apply for reimbursement

713
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,760
Just say I approved it

714
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,550
Anything else?

715
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:14,780
How about Mr. Yan recently?

716
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:18,780
Who?

717
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:20,870
Mr. Yan

718
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:21,920
Mr. Yan

719
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,840
I’m on this

720
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:24,940
Go ahead

721
00:41:26,990 --> 00:41:27,300
OK

722
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:28,590
Then I'll send it right now

723
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:36,340
Okay! Got it!

724
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:37,160
And…

725
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:38,900
Zhen Nian

726
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,200
It's Zhen Nian!

727
00:41:40,210 --> 00:41:40,990
Zhen Nian! Zhen Nian!

728
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:41,820
Take a photo!

729
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,360
She is so beautiful!

730
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,720
Isn't this Zhen Nian?

731
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:03,070
Jingzhi

732
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,490
Welcome

733
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:25,710
Yeah!

734
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,930
What are you doing?

735
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:31,950
Miss Xingchen

736
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,620
You're back

737
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,640
You are…

738
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,460
Miss Xingchen

739
00:42:36,830 --> 00:42:38,050
Zhen Nian is here

740
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,510
Zhen Nian

741
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,240
Is that star Zhen Nian?

742
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:41,710
Yes, yes

743
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,700
I heard she knew J

744
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,330
Can I ask her to hand over the present for me?

745
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:48,030
Can she take a picture with me?

746
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:50,560
Why does Zhen Nian come to our company?

747
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,290
Did the company ask her to take pictures?

748
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:54,620
Breaking News!

749
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:56,590
Director Huang, you…

750
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:58,190
Breaking News!

751
00:42:58,590 --> 00:42:59,370
Just now

752
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:00,660
I went out for a walk

753
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,300
and heard a breaking news

754
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,010
Director Huang, just cut the chase!

755
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,270
What breaking news?

756
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:06,120
Say it!

757
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,860
Miss Zhen and Mr. Yan

758
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:12,290
are going to get engaged!

759
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:14,000
What?

760
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:14,840
What about it?

761
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,600
Miss Zhen and Mr. Yan are going to get engaged!

762
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:19,410
They've known each other since they were in America

763
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:22,690
The boss likes that style

764
00:43:23,490 --> 00:43:24,800
I said you have no chance

765
00:43:25,030 --> 00:43:25,820
You talk too much

766
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:28,040
Since Zhen Nian's debut, there has been no scandal

767
00:43:28,190 --> 00:43:28,790
I think she

768
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:30,630
and Mr. Yan are quite matched

769
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,790
So

770
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:37,600
We are about to welcome her

771
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,720
Mr. Huang

772
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:41,390
Is the news unreliable?

773
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,630
Do you doubt my ability?

774
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:46,490
I asked about it from the design department

775
00:43:46,770 --> 00:43:47,640
No! No! No!

776
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:50,170
I heard the gossip from the design department

777
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:51,800
It is said that

778
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:55,860
Mr. Yan asked them to order a platinum necklace

779
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,880
It was on Miss Zhen's neck today

780
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:02,550
It's Miss Zhen

781
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:03,480
Not Miss Nie

782
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,750
Is it breaking or not?

783
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,260
Breaking enough, huh?

784
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,110
Two Kings, Four Twos

785
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:13,150
Four Kings

786
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:15,900
Four Kings

787
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:20,570
Mr. Yan

788
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,420
What’s this?

789
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,440
My chief secretary

790
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:33,730
Nie Xingchen

791
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,120
Mr. Yan

792
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,060
I would like to ask you

793
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:39,150
why has there been no reply to

794
00:44:39,190 --> 00:44:40,070
my application for resignation?

795
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,170
Why would you resign?

796
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:42,650
I have some personal matters to attend to

797
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,250
What personal matter?

798
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,090
I'm sorry

799
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:47,520
I can't tell you this

800
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,600
Yes, Jingzhi

801
00:44:55,830 --> 00:44:56,800
Since it is a private matter,

802
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,870
it’s not of course good to tell others

803
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,330
I think secretary Nie must have something very important

804
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:01,970
to give up such a good job in Bojue

805
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:06,760
Is it?

806
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:10,290
Even if I have no personal affairs,

807
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,460
I will resign anyway

808
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:13,630
I am not suitable for this job

809
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:14,950
I believe

810
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:17,120
you will certainly find someone more suitable than me

811
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:18,260
Not suitable?

812
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,070
Nie Xingchen

813
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,800
What hard-to-get tricks are you playing?

814
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:26,430
Hard-to-get tricks?

815
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,920
You know I like rosemary

816
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:29,180
and I like blue color

817
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:31,100
even I sleep on the right

818
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:31,850
As you all know,

819
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,680
you've put so much thought into it

820
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,810
Isn't it just to get my attention?

821
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:39,800
Are you trying to say that I am deliberately seducing you?

822
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:40,470
I don't care!

823
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:42,550
For what? Let me tell you

824
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,860
As long as you can finish the work perfectly,

825
00:45:45,260 --> 00:45:46,750
I've never heard of resigning!

826
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:47,640
You can go out

827
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:54,230
Mr. Yan, do you have any narcissistic delusions?

828
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:55,700
What did you say?

829
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:56,920
You are a man who is

830
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,630
low sugar airsickness and fears the sun,

831
00:45:58,690 --> 00:45:59,980
and even counts Calories when eating

832
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:01,440
You have a problem with others when they’re not doing well

833
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:02,910
When they finish it perfectly, you think they have purposes

834
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:04,000
I really haven't seen such a man

835
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,210
like you to please

836
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:06,560
What's more outrageous is that when you do things,

837
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,360
totally disregards of the feelings of others

838
00:46:08,370 --> 00:46:09,720
You are too demanding of yourself,

839
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:10,960
and even have it on others

840
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:11,560
By the way,

841
00:46:11,830 --> 00:46:12,940
Sugar, you eat two

842
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,350
The degree of air conditioning, you order even numbers

843
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,520
What's this

844
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,460
This is called obsessive compulsive disorder

845
00:46:16,510 --> 00:46:17,750
I hope you can find it and treat it early

846
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:18,400
I know

847
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,310
I'll go out myself

848
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:08,550
Where're the minutes of today's meeting?

849
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:10,850
It's held by Secretary Nie

850
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:11,840
I'll come to her

851
00:47:12,010 --> 00:47:12,520
No

852
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:16,170
Director Huang

853
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,090
Can you think of a way to make Secretary to leave the company?

854
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:21,880
Absent?

855
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:24,990
OK

856
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:26,720
I

857
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,730
I will explain that today is my lunar birthday

858
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:29,830
I invite her for dinner

859
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:36,690
Do you want me to give you a present?

860
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,190
Boss, you don't need to spend too much money

861
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,010
If I see her,

862
00:47:43,050 --> 00:47:44,330
you won’t celebrate your birthday later

863
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:52,180
And it will be the date of death!

864
00:47:53,100 --> 00:47:53,730
Secretary Nie

865
00:47:54,010 --> 00:47:54,890
Secretary Nie
