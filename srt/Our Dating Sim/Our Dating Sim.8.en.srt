We will hold our last meeting today. Please gather in the meeting room in an hour, everyone.

Oh, Theo. Eddy's not here yet.

10
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,550
Eddy is not coming because he has a business to attend to.

He didn't even call me.

- Yes?

16
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:50,420
There's something I'm curious about.

Go ahead.

00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,180
Why did you start drawing?

19

Well...

00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:04,500
What's with you, Sunny? Asking him out of the blue?

21
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,800
Are you curious after the project is almost finished?

22
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,150
I guess you wouldn't understand an artist's heart, my cold-hearted planner.

23
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:17,470
CEO, be quiet. I asked Ian.

24
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,970
I guess, now that I think about it,

25
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,230
did I ask you this question at your interview?

26
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:29,020
Ian, why did you start drawing?

27
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,400

Whoa! What's this?

This is practically a relic.

30
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,510
When did you start drawing this?

31
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,110
In high school.

Wow! But the faces

That's right. This is a real artist.

I can tell just from the drawing...

40
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,040
the reason you started drawing.

41
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,730

Excuse me, PD.

I have been drawing every night on a blog no one may see.

55
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:22,600
The reason I continued to draw, erase, and draw again,

56
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,430
was because I wanted to show it to someone.

57
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,790
I drew these pictures hoping that person

58

As you all know, I used to draw cartoons.

141
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:13,610
Recently, I received an official serial request from a webtoon platform. So...

142
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,890
I'm being given a chance to debut as an artist.

143
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:19,450
Whoa, really? That's great news!

144
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:24,720
But it was on the condition that I work abroad.

145
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:27,070
So I rejected them.

146

They want to make our game into a webtoon.

150
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,850
Webtoons are easily accessible, which will help us promote.

151

- I'm all for it!

153
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,940
Truth be told, I've been trying to make contact with the webtoon field.

154
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,760
Did the platform give us the okay?

155
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,010
Yes, we can fine-tune the details if everyone is all right with this.

156
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,040

159
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,140
We would have to make it work, even if it didn't. I'll check.

160
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,610
Okay. Then we have agreed to proceed with this, right?

Don't I get a kiss?

180
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:13,010
Hyeongnim, my foot. My birthday is sooner.

181
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,740
Kiss me.

182
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:20,760
Do you really want to do this first thing in the morning?

183
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:25,750
I should really get going now.

184
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,840
I'm leaving.

185
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,780
Take care.

186
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,200
Now, what? Should I not go?

187
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,420
Yes. Don't go.

188
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,660
Really?

189
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,240
Yes.

190
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,280
Really?

191
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,290
Get there safely.

192
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:57,860
I'm leaving. Just wait for me a bit.

193
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:13,790
Is this a happily ever after?

194
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:16,040
I'm not really sure.

195
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:20,700
We are happy now, but it could be game over anytime.

196
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,660
But one thing I'm sure of

197
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:26,210
in this long game called life,

198
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:28,810
is that the simulations will continue,

199
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,830
and I'll choose love instead of running away.

200
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,270
How do I know this?

201
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,600
Because I have done it once before.

202
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,290
[Game Over]

203
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,680
[Game Restart?]

204
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,650
[Yes/No]

205
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,680
[Last stage]

206
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:56,010
Hey, you were here.

207
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,000
I looked everywhere, and I couldn't find you.

208
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,650
What are you doing here?

209
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,210
Oh, gosh. You smell sweaty.

210
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,300
Is it bad?

211
00:15:12,090 --> 00:15:14,720
I hate P.E.

212
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:18,830
Is that why you were reading comic books here?

213
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:21,470
I can do whatever I want.

214
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:25,510
It's no fun without you.

215
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,430
Let's play dodgeball together.

216
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,670
I never liked P.E.

217
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:36,450
Also, you and I are on different teams.

218
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,100
That doesn't matter.

219
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:44,150
[This is the final stage. Your choice is...]

220
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:47,850
[1. You avoid him because you don't know how he feels.]
[2. Don't run away this time.]

221
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:51,770
[2. Don't run away this time.]

222
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,510
What was that?

223
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:01,280
What?

224
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,950
S-Sorry, sorry.

225
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,320
Sorry.

226
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:08,370
You said I smell sweaty.

227
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,000
It must not be that bad.

228
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,850
I like you.

229
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,280
What about you?

230
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,800
I like you, too.

231
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,180
[Congratulations. You have passed all stages.]

232
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:50,300
[Will you start dating?]
[Yes/No]

233
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:55,100
[Yes]
