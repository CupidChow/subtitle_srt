00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,320
Where are these guys?

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:10,890
They are all busy, Punk. You're the only one who's not.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:13,190
I'm busy, too!

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,450
- In my own way.
- Hey, it's been a while.

6
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,000
- Hey, you're here!
- It's been a while.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,300
- How have you been?
- Do you know what time it is?

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,820
- Sorry, sorry.
- Whatever. Let's drink.

9
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:27,180
Look at you.

10
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:29,830
If someone saw you right now, they would think you drank 3 liters of beer yourself.

11
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:32,000
- What?
- Nothing. I'm not talking about you.

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,830
Our Jin Seok can just keep eating.

13
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,100
Thanks.

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:37,260
How did you reunite with Wan?

15
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,450
- He works at my company.
- What?

16
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,020
Hey! What has he been up to?

17
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:47,280
He disappeared without leaving a trace of whether he was alive or not.

18
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:49,220
You searched everywhere for him.

19
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:52,200
When did I? It wasn't to that extent.

20
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,600
Yes, it was.

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,150
Hey, didn't we make a bet at the time?

22
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,810
I bet he went to study abroad. Han Kyeong Wu—

23
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:02,720
I bet he'd enrolled in a boarding school.

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,770
He just went back to Daejeon and joined the military...

25
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:09,830
His sister runs a restaurant. He helped her and such.

26
00:01:09,830 --> 00:01:13,230
Wow. I can't believe he was still in the country.

27
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:16,520
But we still couldn't find him. That sneaky bastard.

28
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,890
That sneaky bastard. No one won the bet because of him.

29
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,180
Geez.

30
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:24,170
Is that really important right now?

31
00:01:24,170 --> 00:01:27,800
I find these things important.

32
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,700
How is he after all these years?

33
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,830
Nothing changed. He's just the same as before.

34
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,430
I'm a bit bummed.

35
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:37,150
I thought he'd appear after debuting

36
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,760
or appear with cute children in tow. That's what I imagined.

37
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,200
What?

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,890
Your imagination knows no boundaries.

39
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,170
Why? What? What's wrong with that?

40
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:53,110
But... why did he suddenly disappear?

41
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,220
What?

42
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:59,740
I mean... I'm curious about why he suddenly vanished.

43
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:01,150
What could it be?

44
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,690
Hey, whatever the reason, he disappeared without a word.

45
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:06,990
Remember how much Gi Tae suffered?

46
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,340
That was really mean of him.

47
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,220
- Forget it. Let's raise our glasses.
- Sounds good.

48
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,710
Cheers.

49
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,950
From some point,

50
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:20,310
- I began to feign nonchalance.
- No one's going home. We are partying all night.

51
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:23,260
- If I talked about that time,
- I don't think I can.

52
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,070
- I was afraid he might disappear again.
- I have to go soon.

53
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:27,530
Do you have a lover or something?

54
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,100
I intentionally feigned ignorance.

55
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,190

[Episode 7: At the Crossroads of Choice]

58
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,610
It's been a while. Have you been well?

59
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,140
Yes, I didn't think I'd see you again.

60
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,730
I knew we'd meet again.

61
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,500
You took an illustrator job at the Re:Try game company.

62
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,160
They reached out to me not long after our meeting.

63
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,030
I see.

64
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:56,800
The word about you has already spread on our end.

65
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,980
As expected, you were too good to let go.

66
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,050
Gosh, no.

67
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:04,220
It's my coworkers who are great.

68
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:08,120
Wan...

69
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,620
It looks like you're ready to draw other drawings.

70
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:16,000
The thing about timing is quite mysterious.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,530
After parting with you at the final interview,

72
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,090
three other rookie artists were chosen.

73
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:23,760
As we were preparing to leave,

74
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,060
one of the artists suddenly said they couldn't go.

75
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,980
So I asked them why they couldn't and

76
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,880
he said he didn't know why he was drawing and wanted to find the reason. Gosh.

77
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,510
But...

78
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,390
for us to continue with two people...

79
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:47,240
We do have a contract to uphold, so...

80
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,260
it's been postponed.

81
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:52,350
Then I took a look at your illustrations and

82
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,260
noted your skills improved exponentially.

83
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:00,070
Let's go to the camp together.

84
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,450
We're going to start in Australia next month, Artist Lee.

85
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,760
We are going to assign a professional to you for the storyline.

86
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,880
I'm...

87
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:11,800
very grateful, but I'm working on a project

88
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,980
Aren't you leaving once the app launches?

89
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,250
Why are you hesitating? You have to take this chance.

90
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:23,250
What you're doing right now is like a stepping stone, Wan.

91
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:25,860
It's not your final destination.

92
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:29,040
Don't tell me...

93
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,020
Leaving to search for your reason for drawing is forbidden.

94
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,000
I have become neurotic about that now.

95
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:43,210
Then... let's meet again in a couple of days.

96
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:47,650
For me to explain the curriculum to you and to grow closer,

97
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:49,560
and for a drink.

98
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,450
All right then.

99
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,840
That looks so fun.

100
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,240
Oh...

101
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,630
By the way, what's with those plants?

102
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,280
I have been curious for a while.

103
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,120
Oh, they are my hobby.

104
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:26,110
It really doesn't suit you.

105
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:28,060
Why not?

106
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,210
I water them every morning and night at nine o'clock,

107
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:32,310
wipe the leaves here and there,

108
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,080
and check their condition on the weekends.

109
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:38,120
You should try it, too. It's really fun.

110
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,530
I just...

111
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:46,050
feel oddly at ease while looking at them.

112
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,080
They don't go anywhere and take root where they stand.

113
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:55,000
Your words have a hidden meaning.

114
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,590
If you understand, then please don't go anywhere.

115
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:59,250
I'm not going anywhere.

116
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,670
So noisy.

117
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:13,490
It's always a choice between two things.

118
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,340
Gosh, my head hurts.

119
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,560
Isn't it so hard to make a choice?

120
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,040
My head is about split because I can't decide if I should make

121
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,090
the "select" button round or triangular.

122
00:06:25,090 --> 00:06:29,580
Why? My heart is fluttering from developing a dating game.

123
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,650
Wait, wait. Are you dating someone?

124
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:34,570
- Wow.
- Gosh, I feel so betrayed.

125
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,300
No way.

126
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,750
He's always working into the night at the office.

127
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,480
When would he have the time? I say it's impossible.

128
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,200
Impossible?

129
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:47,260
Wait, it's true?

130
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:50,070
Yeah, right...

131
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,920
How could someone like Eddy date anyone?

132
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,750
Don't you think so, Sunny? Do you like his type?

133
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,560
CEO, let's go, please.

134
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,970
- Shall we go to our company dinner?
- Wait, what's wrong with me?

135
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,920
Artist Lee! Over here.

136
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:10,120
Oh, hello.

137
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,660
Why did you come here?

138
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,360
Well, you don't have a car.

139
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,450
It seemed like quite a walk after riding the bus, so

140
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,470
I came to escort you.

141
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,520
- And who might you be?
- He must be a colleague.

142
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,580
- Yes, yes.
- Hello, I'm...

143
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,310
He's a producer I know from before.

144
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:30,910
I'm leaving first. I'll see you later.

145
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:33,840
Okay. Bye.

146
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,430
When are you coming?

147
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:54,160
Hey, why are you so late?

148
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,690
- Hey.
- Hey, hey, hey.

149
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,670
Are you okay? Be careful.

150
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:03,390
Have you been drinking all this time?

151
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,800
Hey, get it together.

152
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,590
Lie down properly.

153
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:15,030
Whoa, it's my handsome boyfriend.

154
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,070
Are you happy leaving your boyfriend to go drinking?

155
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,960
Who was that?

156
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,110
It reeks of alcohol, gosh.

157
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,950
It's coming from you.

158
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,450
Does it?

159
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,870
I will deal with you when you wake up.

160
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,870
Gi Tae.

161
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,410
Why? What? Do you want water?

162
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,950
Or do you need to go to the bathroom?

163
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:45,560
You wouldn't want me going somewhere else, right?

164
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,920
What?

165
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,600
What I mean is... if I leave for somewhere...

166
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,160
What are you talking about?

167
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,160
Wan. Hey, Lee Wan.

168
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,220
The anxiety I had been ignoring all this time

169
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,730
has come back to taunt me.

170
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:24,420
Are you up? Have a seat.

171
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,390
You need to cure that hangover.

172
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,130
What did you do last night?

173
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:51,040
What? Oh, well...

174
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,780
I never meant to get that drunk.

175
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,010
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,720
Not that.

177
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:03,090
Then what? Did I make a mistake?

178
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:07,700
What did you mean about going somewhere else?

179
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:12,100
Where would I go?

180
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,290
Wan...

181
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,520
I'm scared.

182
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,560
What?

183
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,450
I'm scared you'll disappear before my eyes again.

184
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,800
Hey, it's not like that.

185
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,890
Then what did you mean last night?

186
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,300
Was that just drunk talk then?

187
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:49,360
You can't say anything.

188
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:55,510
It's fine if you don't tell me right now

189
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,330
since the answer is set.

190
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,990
You can't leave me this time.

191
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:07,890
You can't run away. I will make it that way.

192
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:36,680
If I could, when should I turn back time to?

193
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:44,670
We might be feeling... the same sense of anxiety.

194
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,490
I'm sorry for cornering you. Let's talk.

195
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:05,800
I can't even reach him.
[Wan]

196
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,580
The call cannot be connected. You'll be redirected to the voicemail.

197
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,190
After the beep, there will be a charge for the call.

198
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,690
Hey, Lee Wan!

199
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,540
Hey, Wan!

200
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,840
Well, sorry.

201
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,960
I'll be off.

209
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,600
Hey.

210
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,520
Hey. Where have you been all this time?

211
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,880
Why aren't you picking up your phone?

212
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,140
Once again, I thought you...

213
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,890
Something came up at Nuna's restaurant.

214
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,130
You disappeared,

215
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,490
but I didn't know where you might be.

216
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:06,280
It was the same as seven years ago.

217
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,560
I'm such an idiot...

218
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,720
Sorry...

219
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:17,060
I told you. I'm scared, Wan.

220
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:22,300
I'm so scared you might disappear before my eyes.

221
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,040

- It came out so nice. Look at this.
- It is pretty nice.

230

But how come there aren't any photos of us?
