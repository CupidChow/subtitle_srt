[Episode 6: The Promise to Not Be Apart]

6
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,300
Did he go for round two with Eddy last night?

7
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,950
Gosh, he's adorable.

8
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,910
You're too much.

9
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,560
I have found a match for Ian.

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,070
Good morning.

11
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:58,600
Oh, you're here.

12
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,930
Let's get started, everyone.

13
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:05,850
Hey, Ian.

14
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,550
Why are you so surprised?

15
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:14,620
I have something to say, so follow me.

16
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,740
Right now?

17
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,890
Yes, right now.

18
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,370
The alert screen is missing after this button is clicked.

19
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,450
It would be great if you could add it while editing the profile page.

20
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:41,570
Oh, okay.

21
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:46,120
Oh, you have nothing to write with.

22
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:49,160
I'll organize everything and send it to you.

23
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,450
Also... your answer is?

24
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:59,000
Excuse me? Wh-What answer?

25
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,910
Don't you remember last night?

26
00:02:01,910 --> 00:02:04,920
Last night, you and I were both drunk.

27
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,100
I wasn't drunk.

28
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,880
I just acted drunk because I was embarrassed.

29
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,120
Then... were you being sincere?

30
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,110
Would you kiss someone for fun?

31
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,740
Hey, hey...

32
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:28,610
Anyhow, don't you like me?

33
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,820
You can give it a try.

34
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,830
What?

35
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,460
You can give it a try.

36
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,800
Try what?

37
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,050
If you really like me...

38
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,780
you can try having a crush on me for a little longer.

39
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,960
You're driving me crazy.

40
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,500
I'll organize what we couldn't discuss in a file and send it to you.

41
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:11,970
All right, Ian?

42
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,990
Ian!

43
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:37,020
What are you doing?

44
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:39,680

Hello?

48
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,050
Are you still sleeping?

49
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,750
It's the weekend.

50
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,700
Let's go on a date.

51
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,120
All of a sudden?

52
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,180
Yes. Get ready and come out.

53
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:16,920
Hey.

54
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,740
What?

55
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:21,830
Who asks someone out like that?

56
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,710
Then?

57
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,610
You've never been in unrequited love, have you?

58
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,950
Hello?

59
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,590
Hey, Wan, you know... is it okay for you to talk right now?

60
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,380
Yes.

61
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,530
I somehow got my hands on some exhibition tickets.

62
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:57,910
If you don't have any plans, do you want to go together?

63
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,780
Not sure...

64
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,070
I don't really like exhibitions.

65
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,300
Is that so? That's what I thought. Then let's go somewhere you want to go.

66
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,050
I'll wait.

67
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,290
Sure then...

68
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll think about it.

69
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,390
Okay.

70
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,160
I feel like you'll only go on park dates until you're a grandpa.

71
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,540
I like calm places.

72
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,880
Okay, Grandpa.

73
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,800
Stop that.

74
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:06,090
Wan, can I ask you something?

75
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,040
Sure.

76
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,190
How much longer do I have to do this?

77
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,380
This unrequited love.

78
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:20,950
Well. I'm not sure.

79
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:25,990
You still have a long way to go if you want to measure up to what I did.

80
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,660
Do you even know when my unrequited love started?

81
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:31,220
When did it start?

82
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:33,110
I'm not sure.

83
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,800
Ever since my Wan disappeared.

84
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,010
Longer than you think, huh?

85
00:06:40,010 --> 00:06:44,140
So hurry up. I really don't like unrequited love.

86
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,130
It's so frustrating.

87
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:52,240
Then did you really like me back then, too?

88
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,740
That's what I'm telling you. You asked the same thing last time as well.

89
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,100
If you can't believe me, then don't.

90
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:02,850
Then have you never dated even once?

91
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,300
What?

92
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,990
That's...

93
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,040
Hey, Wan, should we go somewhere else?

94
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,190
It's too hot here. It's too hot.

95
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:18,240
Stop changing the subject. Hurry and spill it.

96
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,770
It was once during my freshman year in college when I didn't know any better.

97
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,780
It was just once, really.

98
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,740
Gosh, look at this.

99
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,960
This seven-year unrequited love was all a lie.

100
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,990
It's not a lie.

101
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:36,450
Wan, you know... I can only date someone I really like...

102
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:39,200
Someone I sincerely like.

103
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,990
I wasn't happy at all dating that person.

104
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,110
Then date me.

105
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:50,610
What?

106
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,810
I said you can date me.

107
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,170
Really?

108
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,650
Forget it if you don't want to.

109
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,790
Hey, Wan. Did you ever date anyone?

110
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,830
Of course, I did. Of course.

111
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,750
You did? Whom?

112
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,560
Who's the guy?

113
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,570
There is this guy. I mean...

114
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:28,340
There was this good guy that you don't know.

115
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,320
So you did date?

116
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,260
You have dated.

117
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,810
For goodness' sake, I didn't. Are you happy now?

118
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,270
I'm happy.

119
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,340
And don't wear your hair like this. It's annoying.

120
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:53,110
Whoa, are you controlling your boyfriend?

121
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,310
What are you saying?

122
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:58,200
Wait for me. Wait for me!

123
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:42,280
You're such a comic otaku.

124
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:46,890
I acknowledge that you chose the perfect career for yourself.

125
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:52,290
And you?

126
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,030
You're right.

127
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,600
Wan, being like this

128
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,640
feels like we have returned to high school.

129
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,160
We always ditched P.E. and stayed in the classroom.

130
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:11,320
I played games, and you read comics. That's how we became close.

131
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,610
Gosh, I really enjoyed it back then.

132
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:18,400
As if. You always yelled while gaming

133
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,220
and made me mess up my drawings.

134
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:24,350
So? Did you not enjoy it?

135
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,200
If you didn't like it, you should have gone somewhere else to draw. Why were you always by my side?

136
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,570
Well, it became quiet shortly after since you always fell asleep.

137
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,500
It was tolerable.

138
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,800
Do you think I wouldn't know?

139
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,450
Know what?

140
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:43,160
When I fell asleep after gaming,

141
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,790
you would stare at me intently.

142
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:52,000
What are you saying? Why would I do that?

143
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:59,160
Aigo, how cute. Just cute. You're honestly too cute.

144
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:02,300
Okay, I closed my eyes. Look at me all you want.

145
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,630
Do whatever you want.

146
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,080
Look at you.

147
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,470
- You said I could.
- Come here.

148
00:11:17,470 --> 00:11:19,630
Come here. How could you suddenly kiss me out of nowhere?

149
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,200
Forgive me this once.

150
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,730
Come here. Seriously.

151
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:29,380
- Come here.
- It tickles.

152
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,330
Hey.

153
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,740
Who's the one who gave me a hard time being tactless?

154
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,610
- Let go. What the heck?
- Don't interrupt them.

155
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:53,720
That's Ian's match Jamie has been talking about.

156
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,060
Match?

157
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,650
Yes, match.

158
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,190
This is the blind date set in motion when Ian entered the company. Did you not know about it?

159
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:04,030
Jamie's long-term project.

160
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:08,290
So don't interrupt them and let's eat something delicious together.

161
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,940
Gosh! Let go of me.

162
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,190
What's wrong with you?

163
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:15,060
What have you been looking at? Let me see it.

164
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,310
What's this?

165
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:19,570
- Let go.
- Let's go and eat.

166
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,220
Let's go.

167
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,300
Aren't you hungry, Eddy? How could you not take a single bite?

168
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:32,640
Thanks to you, I ate two bowls. I fail at my diet.

169
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,040
Did you two have a good lunch?

170
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,090
Did you two have fun?

171
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,400
It's a secret!

172
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,840
You two are late.

173
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,820
- Oh, that's because Jamie—
- Today's late night coffee...

174
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,650
- Isn't it on Jamie this time?
- Oh, is it?

175
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:50,870
See you.

176
00:12:50,870 --> 00:12:54,330
But it'll be hard for Jamie to carry everything by herself.

177
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,290
Right?

178
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,800
Jamie, wait up! I think I should go, too.

179
00:13:05,770 --> 00:13:08,980
Hey, what was that? From earlier.

180
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:12,280
What? Oh, that?

181
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:15,490
Jamie's friend is a fan of mine,

182
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,860
so she introduced us.

183
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,490
So that was a fan meeting? Not a blind date?

184
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,400
Yes.

185
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,290
What's up? Why are you so angry?

186
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,010
Are you jealous?

187
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,630
Yes, I'm jealous.

188
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:34,920
How could I not be when my boyfriend went on a blind date?

189
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:37,580
Oh, boyfriend...

190
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,930
You are.

191
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,790
What if someone sees us at work? Come on.

192
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:44,450
- Who cares?
- Stop.

193
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:48,810
Hey, it hurts!

194
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:50,370
It hurts.
(T/N: He switches from informal to formal speech.)

195
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:54,290
It hurts.

196
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,690
Sunny, did you enjoy your lunch?

197
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,670
You two are very affectionate these days.

198
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:04,730
Oh, ever since we went for round two after the company dinner...

199
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,540
Yes, the company dinner.

200
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,360
Good for you.

201
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:18,770
You're too careless.

202
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:22,050
Why, why? What? Who'll say anything about us dating?

203
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,990
Bring them to me.

204
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,000
Don't you know what will happen if we're caught?

205
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,160
Who cares?

206
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,910
Well, soon I won't be here anymore—

207
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:39,630
I see. There's no reason for Wan to come back.

208
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:41,350
It was like that.

209
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:45,040
I'm not saying we'll break up.

210
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,390
Come on, be more careful. We're at work.

211
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,370
Don't say things like that.

212
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,470
We went through so much to reunite.

213
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,320
Sorry.

214
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,400
If you're sorry, do better.

215
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:02,210
If you're sorry, don't run away from now on.

216
00:15:02,210 --> 00:15:03,690
I won't.

217
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:06,820
And don't smile like that in front of anyone else.

218
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,080
Tell her no, straightforwardly, if Jamie says she'll set you up on a blind date. Do you understand?

219
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,990
What's this? Are you still jealous?

220
00:15:13,990 --> 00:15:16,970
One more thing. Don't wear such cute clothes to work.

221
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,210
I hate other people looking at my favorite outfit of yours.

222
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:25,240
Oh, are you controlling your boyfriend now?

223
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,850
Good, good.

224
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,430
You...

225
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,350
What is it?

226
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:35,150
What do you think?

227
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:39,520
You thought I'd hold your hand, but I was going for a hug.

228
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:42,200
- Someone's going to come and see us.
- Who would come here? No one will.

229
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,640
They're here. They're here.

230
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,720
- I won't fall for it. Three minutes.
- No.

231
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:49,510
Then just for one minute. Let's just stay like this. No one will come—

232
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,950
- Oh, I got a text.
- Don't lie.

233
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:56,110
For real. Look. I'm going to check my text.

234
00:15:56,110 --> 00:15:59,100
- One minute.
- One minute.

235
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,760

No, we'll get in trouble.

What will we do once we run away?

247
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:20,690
I'm not sure... What should we do?

248
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,560
Whatever you want.

249
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,730
I don't really have anything I want to do.
