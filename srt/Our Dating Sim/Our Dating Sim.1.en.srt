Hold on. Hold on!

9
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,670
I'm sorry. I'm a bit late.

10
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,480
Even on an important interview day like this,

11
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,170
I bumped into someone who looks just like him from the back.

12
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,360
Hello!

13
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,460
I'm Lee Wan.

14
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,560
This way.

15
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,440
I'm the CEO of Re:Try, who contacted you.

16
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,820
Oh, you must be nervous. Your hands are sweaty.

17
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,720
Relax, relax.

18
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,920
And one more person will be joining us.

19
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,280
The person who'll be joining us

20
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,680
is more handsome than me. He's younger too.

21
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,480
But so what? I'm the CEO. Me.

22
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:30,890
Oh, he's here. Come.

00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,830

I'm Shin Gi Tae, a planner and developer.

26
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,930
I was wrong.

27
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:54,920
It wasn't someone who looked like him. It was him.

My old karma. Shin Gi Tae.

29
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,790
Excuse me...

30
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,700
Oh, yes. Yes...

31
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:12,780
He's a bit nervous. Have a seat. Let's start.

32
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,300
All right.

33
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:20,990
I enjoyed the webtoon you posted on your blog.

34
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,970
You get many calls from everywhere, don't you?

35
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,510
Since your art style is remarkable.

36
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,160
When did you begin to draw?

37
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,000
I actively started drawing

38
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,540
while preparing for college admissions...

39
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:40,480
So I actually started earlier than that... At the time, I was...

40
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,130
Well...

41
00:04:42,130 --> 00:04:46,770
I told you to relax. It's okay. Loosen up.

42
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,980
As I explained,

43
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,160
the game we're planning is a dating simulation.

44
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,160
It's an interactive game similar to our previous game.

45
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,340
It's school-related and geared toward females.

46
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,620
So when I saw your webtoon, I thought you were perfect.

47
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,630
I contacted you before anyone else could steal you.

48
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,210
Mr. Lee Wan?

49
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:07,730
Have you played our previous game?

50
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,330
Yes, I have.

51
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:14,770
- What about the ending?
- The ending?

52
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,910
I don't remember accurately,

53
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,130
but I think it had to do with escaping the building.

54
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:25,580
I see... an ending where you escape?

55
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,730
Yes, escaping from the building...

56
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,160
Yes, I think I escaped...

57
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:45,230
Our game was fun, right?

58
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:47,700
Yes, it was fun.

59
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,750
Lee Wan, there is nothing more to be said about your art. It's incredible.

60
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:56,500
This is your first job at a company, right?

61
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,820
Yes.

62
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,860
I will ask you some questions.

63
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,880
What would you do if the art style requested

64
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,310
by our company is different from the style you want?

65
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,020
First, I'd propose a compromise and try to accommodate...

66
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,960
No compromise.

67
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:19,150
You must give one up. What then?

68
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,990
Then...

69
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:27,220
I think I'd proceed with the style requested by the company.

70
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,910
Second question.

71
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:33,200
If you receive a recruitment offer from another company during a project,

72
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,370
what would you do?

73
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:40,660
If it's an excellent offer, I'd ask them to wait until our project is over—

74
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:44,450
If you don't choose immediately, that opportunity will pass you by.

75
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,510
You can't delay it. What would you do?

76
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,200
Well...

77
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:52,050
So...

78
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,470
All right. I see.

79
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:13,860
Our goal is to launch an app.

80
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:17,870
You'll be given three months. You will be working late,

81
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:21,150
and there will be disagreements, so because of that,

82
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,800
if you run away in the middle,

83
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,010
it'll be hard to work together, right?

84
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:29,750
You just need to hang in there for three months.

85
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,810
Geez, so scary.

86
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:37,470
He's just trying to scare you. Don't be too burdened.

87
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,600
I also run away daily because I'm scared of him.

88
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:53,530
I once imagined the day we would meet again...

89
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,290
but... it wasn't like this.

90
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,650
Good job.

91
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:07,330
I'll text you soon.

92
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,620

93
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,100
No.

94
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,360
No, no. It's fine.

95
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,970
Eddy is on his way down anyway since he lost the game.

96
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,750
It's on the way. Eddy, it's all good, right?

97
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,730
Of course.

98
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:25,810

99
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,670

102
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,640
Sure.

103
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,380
Oh, Eddy.

104
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,800
Why did you leave so quickly yesterday?

105
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,610
It was so boring because you left early.

106
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,950
I had to fix a bug.

107
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:02,790
Sorry, Jamie.

108
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:05,960
Come to our next company dinner. Promise?

109
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,850
I'll definitely come to the next company dinner.

110
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,880
- Mr. Lee Wan.
- Yes?

111
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,450
Are you dating anyone?

112
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,850
Sorry?

113
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:25,100
Are you dating anyone?

114
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,520
Wow, our company is so easygoing.

115
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,520
It's because the game we're developing

116
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,140
is a dating simulation.

117
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:37,850
I'm just curious.

118
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:44,630
Oh, I need to get off here. I'll get going.

119
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,850

- Hey.

125
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,640
Are you done with your interview? How did it go?

126
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,400
I don't know. I'm doomed.

127
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:25,590
What the heck? Then quickly come back to Daejeon.

128
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,890
There are so many customers at the restaurant.

129
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,880
My brother, I miss you.

130
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,510
You told me to leave and never come back.

131
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:35,410
You asked how long I'd stay cooped up in my room drawing.

132
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:39,030
Hey, that only applies if you pass the interview.

133
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:42,470
If you think it won't work out, come back right away.

134
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,360
He's not the artist. He, himself, is the character.

135
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,620
Isn't he really cute?

136
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,250
- Cute?
- Yes, totally.

137
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:56,000
He looks like a deer.

138
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,310
- What are you saying?
- Oh, he's Bambi!

139
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:01,350
His eyes are so big and round.

140
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,290
Anyway, he's so cute.

141
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:08,720
I hope he stays with our company forever.

142
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,290
You should have tried harder. Do you really think you failed?

143
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:15,460
I don't know. I don't feel confident.

144
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:17,340
And someone who makes me feel uncomfortable works here, too.

145
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,820
Who? Did someone bully you?

146
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,540

147
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,310

00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,880
Your best friend? Of course, I remember.

149
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,740
He always came to our house to play games.

150
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,620
Does he work there?

151
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,140
I guess so.

152
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,940
That's good. Ask him to give you the job.

153
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,120
What are friends for?

154
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,960
Friends?

155
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,070
Nuna, I'll call you back later. Bye.

156
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:13,110
I met my failed first love after seven years.

157
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:17,710
And at a job interview at that.

158
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,380
The start of everything was

159
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,860
that day, seven years ago.

[Seven years ago, February 10, 2015]

161
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:36,790
Our family suddenly went bankrupt.

162
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,850
Our aunt's house in Daejeon became our house.

163
00:12:43,910 --> 00:12:47,030
Hey, are you really not getting on?

164
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:50,670
Why are you being stubborn? You're past the rebellious age.

165
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,500
- Student, are you not getting on?
- Seriously...

166
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,860
[Gi Tae] Let's grab drinks with the guys after graduation.

167
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,730
You can't skip it.

168
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:08,420
Bring your camera.

169
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:11,440
Hey, get in, man!

170
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,360
Nuna, go ahead. I'll catch up soon.

171
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,510
Hey, where are you going?

172
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:21,150
Unfortunately, that was the beginning of my twenties.

173
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:26,410
But there was something I needed to confirm.

174
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:33,160
I don't think he's coming. Let's go.

175
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,470
Maybe he doesn't know where we are?

176
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:37,990
No, he'll come.

177
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:40,680
What if he's cooped up in some cram school somewhere?

178
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,980
That guy in our class...

179
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,880
Whoa. I forgot his name already just after graduating.

180
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,180
- The vice-president of our class?
- Yes!
