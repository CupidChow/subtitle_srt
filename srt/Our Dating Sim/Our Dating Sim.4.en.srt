Why would you harass him when need all the manpower we can get?

Oh, is it because the work is too hard?

What? I don't— What if I don't want that?

106
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,570
It doesn't matter what you want. It's my wish.

108
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,460
No, I'm going to keep an eye on him so he doesn't wander off.

That's not what I meant. Why did we come here when there are countless schools in Seoul?

119
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,290
Isn't this school better than asking an unfamiliar school for permission to enter?

120

We're allowed here since we're graduates from here.

This is really the last place, right?

Go rest in the car if you're tired.

150
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:28,830
Or you can give me the card and leave first.

151
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:30,740
Why do you need the card?

152
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,820
You have the car, and I need to get a ride from the taxi.

By the way, I have something to ask you.

159
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:00,280
Didn't you take photos with a film camera

160
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,710
to make drawings with them in the past?

161
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,820
I don't take photos.

162
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,540
Why not?

163
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,840
What about that film camera from before?

00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,150
Why do you have that?

165
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:42,310
I found this while looking for you.

What? Why would you... Hey, why would you pick up something I threw out?

Why did you throw it out?

168
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,380
- Give it to me.
- Why did you throw it out?

169
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,260
- Give it to me.
- No.

00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,690
- Hand it over.
- No.

171
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,730
- Give it to me!
- I said no.
- Please!

Please...

00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:09,270
stop harassing me.

What?

176
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,660
Fine, I'll just be left behind again.

177
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,630

Hey, Lee Wan.

179
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,550
I searched for you for a long time.

180
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,320
But I couldn't reach you,

181
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,800
nor could I find you anywhere I thought you'd be.

182
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,120
There was nothing I could do.

183
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,290
Have you been well? Without me?

184
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:03,600
I'm harassing you? No.

185
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,080
You're the one who harassed me for seven years.

186
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,630
Hey...

187
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,720
I won't let you go anymore.

188
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:14,200
I like you.

189
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,540
What?

190
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,550
[Game Over]

191
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,000

192
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,480
[Yes/No]

193

[Stage 03]

194
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:30,370
[P.E. period is when I can see him play soccer all I want.]

195
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,310
Again, again!

196
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,270
Hey, Wan! Are you okay?

197
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,700
Hey, wake up. Lee Wan!

198
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,560
Gosh, Lee Wan!

199
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,330
Hey, get it together. Come on. Hey.

200
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,220
This won't do. Get on my back.

201
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:51,780
[Honestly, I was fine besides the slight dizziness...]

202
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,180
Quickly get on.
[1. Just feign ignorance and get on his back.]
[2. Get back up and tell him it's okay.]

203
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:00,020
[1. Just feign ignorance and get on his back.]

204
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,470
What are you doing? Get on!

205
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,890
