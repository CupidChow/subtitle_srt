Hello. You're here early.

3
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,860
Hello! My name is Lee Wan, and this is my first day.

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,900
Oh, you scared me. I'm Jamie.

5
00:00:16,900 --> 00:00:19,270
We met when you came for the interview, right?

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:22,670
- Yes.
- Okay, follow me.

7
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,230
The Mr. Wan we've been waiting for has arrived for work!

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:29,150
Goodness! You're here early.

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:32,530
I've been waiting a long time.

10
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,620
Finally, our Wan—

11
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:38,130
But your clothes are...

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,910
I told you to wear comfortable clothes.

13
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,040
You did... But it's still my first day, so...

14
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,420
Okay. Have you thought about it?

15
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,630
- Sorry?
- Your gaming nickname.

16
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:57,010
We call each other by our nicknames.

17
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:00,220
I'll think about it.

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:04,120
Well, I'm The-o... Theo.

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,120
You have already met Jamie, right?

20
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,170
Oh, and you saw Eddy at the interview.

21
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:13,560
He'll be here soon. Oh, and Sunny.

22
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,270
Sunny is always exhausted, but she's a skilled developer.

23
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:24,770
She actually lost her voice after catching a cold from staying up four nights.

24
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:28,970
We welcome you. Welcome to "Zombie World."

25
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,190
Take a look around. There are a lot of fun things.

26
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,740
Like this, and this, and this.

27
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,230
- Excuse me.
- Oh, you scared me.

28
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,010
This is my seat.

Here.

33
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,270
Thank you.

34
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:54,910
I'm sorry there's a lot of work, although it's your first day.

35
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,020
It's okay. It's not like I didn't know.

36
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,010
- It's fun.
- Okay.

37
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,400
I heard you'll be using the night duty room for three months.

38
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,790
Yes, I don't really have a place to stay.

39
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,460
I see.

40
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,820
The night duty room is nice. It's really cozy, so use it comfortably.

41
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,680
Whether it's night or day.

42
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,020
By the way,

43
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,360
your clothes are making me feel uncomfortable.

44
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,200
- Should I take this off for you?
- No, no.

45
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,440
I can take it off.

46
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,800
Theo, was the plan we came up with yesterday confirmed?

47
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,670
Oh, that? Let me check.

48
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:32,040
Let me know within an hour so we can start working on it.

49
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,160
I told you I would.

50
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:44,650
You can wear this. I don't wear this anymore.

51
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:48,240
You get the gist of our game, right?

52
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,930
Then please prepare the review for our next meeting.

53
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,020
Sorry? What about the draft you told me to prepare?

54
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:58,530
That should also be done by our next meeting.

55
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,930
A review is pretty simple. It's about what you saw and felt.

56
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:06,110
Why? Is that too difficult?

57
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,220
No, no.

58
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,540
I'll have it ready by our next meeting.

59
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,560
Okay. Please show it to me first before the meeting.

60
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,330
Good luck.

61
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,010
- Excuse me...
- Is this everything for the draft?

62
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:32,280
I didn't have much time after I finished the review.

63
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:36,870
And this is it... for the review too?

64
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,900
I kept getting "game over" whenever I played,

65
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,940
so I couldn't even reach the restage.

66
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:43,360
You quit playing the game

67
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,730
because you kept getting "game over."

68
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:49,740
That means our game wasn't fun.

69
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,590
- That's not it.
- No.

70
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:56,050
You will play a fun game (until the end), no matter how many times you lose.

71
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:58,460
Even if you have to pull an all-nighter.

72
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,100
Since you want to reach the end.

73
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,700
Now, let's think about why you didn't find our game fun.

74
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,700
Number one, because you weren't curious about the end.

75
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,760
Number two, because the options weren't fun.

76
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:15,700
Number three, because you just didn't focus.

77
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,390
Why aren't you focusing when you're here to work?

78
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,630
Please do your best.

79
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,920
Number two.

80
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,650
Sorry?

81
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,500
The options weren't fun.

82
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,460
Go on.

83
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,910
These options don't reflect real users' feelings.

84
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:53,620
You feel even more pathetic and desperate when you want to return to a particular moment.

85
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,560
But these don't reflect any of that.

86
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,060
Of course, I'm talking about the game here...

87
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:08,930
Wait, so... going back like this.

88
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:12,650
If they could turn back time,

89
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:15,320
what options should we provide?

90
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,310
Yes, well... that's good criticism.

91
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:24,680
Then could you create a list of options that reflects the pathetic sentiment of the users?

92
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,680
By tomorrow's meeting.

93
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,270
I think it will also be good to touch up on the character draft too.

94
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,300
Then I'll leave it to you.

95
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:40,980
Did you choose your nickname yet?

96
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,990
Ian!

97
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:47,980
It's the name of the main character of your blog's webtoon.

98
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,880
Use that as your nickname.

99
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:28,130
When did he read my blog?

100
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,820
Did Theo show it to him?

101
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,320
Then did he already read all that?

102
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,870
Geez, he's getting on my nerves.

103
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,400
Isn't this workplace harassment or something like that?

104
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:50,690
Going back like this.

105
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,720
If they could turn back time...

106
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:01,190
When will I finish all this? Oh my gosh.

107
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,010
Goodness, Wan. Your face is...

108
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,230
What happened?

109
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,920
I couldn't sleep last night.

110
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,800
It's okay. You're still handsome.

111
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,430
Look at our CEO's face. He still looks like that after a full night's sleep.

112
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:35,260
Jamie.

113
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,980
Okay, okay. Shall we get started? Wan.

114
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:42,250
Oh, Ian. Please present the review you prepared.

115
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,920
Ian?

116
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,640
The name of the main character of Wan's webtoon! Ian. That's right.

117
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,410
Good choice.

118
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:58,000
All right then, Ian. Please go ahead.

119
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,920
I think there should be more options

120
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,600
leading to ambiguous situations between the two of them.

121
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,740
Right now, it feels like their affections are too rushed.

122
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,500
When you have a crush, those ambiguous moments are the most heart-fluttering.

123
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,860
Whoa, Ian! You must have experienced a lot of unrequited love.

124
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,990
It's nothing like that.

125
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:30,050
But if the options are too ambiguous,

126
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,770
don't you think the users might feel confused?

127
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,430
Yes,

128
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,900
but that's how someone in an unrequited love behaves.

129
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:40,530
- It doesn't really go according to your plan.
- But...

130
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,510
this is a game, not reality.

131
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:51,060
Well, let's hear Ian's opinion.

132
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,950
He's the first member who can point out anything we missed.

133
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,090
Right now, the only function is to send and receive messages with the characters,

134
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:04,080
but what if we add a character's SNS function?

135
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:06,180
SNS?

136
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,280
You know how we all scroll through our crush's SNS?

137
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,030
What they like, what music they listen to,

138
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,990
and if they found any new love interests.

139
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,990
We can also provide hints on what the character is feeling.

140
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,360
Wow, Ian's idea is rather good.

141
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,070
Gosh! Are you an expert on unrequited love or what?

142
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:31,530
Yes, well... sounds good.

143
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:34,240
This is a really great idea,

144
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,330
but we don't have much time until the launch of the test version.

145
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:39,730
Can we add this in?

146
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:43,360
We can. We can't abandon this idea because it's that great.

147
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,420
Let's confirm all possible aspects

148
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,350
and apply them before the official launch.

149
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,830
Okay.

150
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,920
All right, our planning team should now get into more specific planning.

151
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,540
Ian, you can give us some reference materials.

152
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,930
- And please start the drawings in more detail.
- Yes.

153
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,030
Good job, everyone.

154
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:04,520
End of meeting. Shall we have a company dinner?

155
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,740
- We need to go planning.
- Yes, I'm aware.

156
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,660
Why is he so chic?

157
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,260
Your idea is nice, Ian.

158
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,380
Eddy has a good eye for people.

159
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:24,790
He wouldn't stop recommending you to us.

160
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:27,520
Did Sunny just speak?

161
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,450
Sunny! Your voice is back!

162
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:34,510
Daebak! I almost forgot your voice.

163
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,700
Who recommended whom?

164
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:40,910
Eddy recommended you.

165
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:44,800
He discovered your blog and showed it to us.

166
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,860
Even though we warned him it was risky on our part due to our tight schedule,

167
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,060
Eddy's the one who kept pushing through.

168
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:51,700
Eddy suggested we wait for you.

169
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,960
Exactly.

170
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,810
Do you know how much Eddy argued with Sunny, insisting it had to be you, Ian?

171
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,010
How could he have recognized such a blessing?

172
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:03,410
Can I give you a hug? Come here.

173
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:16,530
Excuse me. Can we have a talk?

174
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,790
Did I do something wrong?

175
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:37,690
Why did you suddenly ask me to come to the rooftop?

176
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:45,480
- Ian?
- It's you, isn't it?
(T/N: Eddy is talking in a formal manner, while Ian suddenly switches to informal speech.)

177
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,380
The one who recommended me.

178
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,840
You?

179
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:56,880
You know who I am, don't you? You're acting like this knowing who I am, right?

180
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:00,030
Of course, I know you. Why wouldn't I know you?

181
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,500
Then why didn't you tell me?

182
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,620
Are you trying to make me look like a fool? Are you having fun?

183
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,690
What am I supposed to do when we met at work?

184
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,870
I only played along since you seemed uncomfortable with me.

185
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,420
- What are you trying to do after all this time?
- What?

186
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,690
Everything is already over.

187
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:21,950
What did you bring me into the company for?

188
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,460
What do you think? To work together.

189
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,770
Are you doing this intentionally to harass me?

190
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,760
Why would I harass you?

191
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,410
Our company just happened to need an illustrator,

192
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,000
and I somehow discovered your webtoon and liked your illustrations.

193
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,080
Don't you remember I...

194
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:43,670
All right, let's work. No feelings involved. Just pure work.

195
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,550
And don't make things difficult for me for no reason.

196
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:47,850
When did I ever make it difficult for you?

197
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:50,540
I just taught an incompetent newbie how to work.

198
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,400
No one is good at what they do when they start.

199
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:57,460
Just wait three months. I'll do better than you.

200
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,540
All right then. Don't you dare run away in the middle of it.

201
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:04,170
Fill up all three months and become better than me.

202
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:08,370
Hey! Is it fun toying around with me?

203
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,090
You, stay out of my sight.

204
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:14,360
How could I? There are only five people at our company.

205
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,850
- You don't know, do you?
- Know what?

206
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,180
Of course, you don't.

207
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,060
- Know what?
- It's me.

208
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,490
Gameboy.

209
00:14:32,450 --> 00:14:37,150
I couldn't resist starting a conversation with you. I was too happy.

210
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,290
Why... Why would you...

211
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:45,010
Wait, why... why would you search and read that?

212
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:48,520
You know this is basically stalking right now.

213
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:51,200
Didn't you say why just now?

214
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,890
The reason we look through our crush's SNS.

215
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:57,830
You know how we all scroll through our crush's SNS?

216
00:14:57,830 --> 00:15:01,570
What they like, what music they listen to,

217
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:05,650
and if they found any new love interests.

218
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,720
Well, if I had to say why,

219
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,110
I have always liked your drawings. Since back then.
