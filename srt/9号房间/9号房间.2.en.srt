3
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,800
<i>Snow was forecasted for today,
Christmas Eve, in Seoul, Gyeonggi</i>

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,300
<i>but there's a forecast of the Perseus
meteor shower in the central region.</i>

5
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,956
<i>Just as its name indicates, a meteor
shower is when meteors fall like rain.</i>

6
00:00:46,956 --> 00:00:50,813
<i>This meteor shower in the central
region will be the first in 44 years.</i>

7
00:00:50,813 --> 00:00:56,771
<i>From Cheongwon, Miwon, and Cheongchun,
it will be visible with the naked eye.</i>

8
00:00:56,771 --> 00:01:00,681
<i>Have you heard that if you wish upon a
shooting star, your wish will come true?</i>

9
00:01:00,681 --> 00:01:02,607
<i>If you live in this region</i>

10
00:01:02,607 --> 00:01:05,172
<i>don't be disappointed by
the lack of snow on Christmas.</i>

11
00:01:05,172 --> 00:01:11,447
<i>Instead, make it a special Christmas
by wishing upon a shooting star.</i>

12
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:21,817
We'll be finished soon!

13
00:02:21,817 --> 00:02:23,452
We need to make sure you're okay!

14
00:02:23,452 --> 00:02:25,468
You had an electric shock.

<i>[Episode 2]</i>

17
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:14,717
What in the world is going on?

18
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:20,829
This can't be happening.

19
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,573
Why are you doing this?

20
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:30,566
I thought I was dreaming.

21
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:31,983
But it hurts.

22
00:03:31,983 --> 00:03:35,496
You hit your head on the ground
when you fell, Attorney Eulji.

23
00:03:37,287 --> 00:03:39,497
Attorney?

24
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:43,664
- Attorney Eulji Hae Yi...
- You should go see a doctor.

25
00:03:43,664 --> 00:03:46,037
No.

26
00:03:47,643 --> 00:03:49,368
I'm fine.

27
00:03:51,227 --> 00:03:53,091
Nothing's wrong with me.

28
00:04:00,112 --> 00:04:02,217
I'm just in shock.

29
00:04:03,195 --> 00:04:06,600
I was just a little shocked.

30
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,105
Of course, you would be shocked.

31
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,842
Oh, that attorney...
She went to Seoul saying she's fine.

32
00:04:31,842 --> 00:04:32,917
What?

33
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:35,977
She was in a mental coma for over
30 minutes because of the electric shock.

34
00:04:35,977 --> 00:04:37,482
How could you just send her away?

35
00:04:38,388 --> 00:04:42,119
- She's not doing too well.
- Yes, start the car.

36
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,441
I...

37
00:04:57,679 --> 00:05:00,200
Here's your key.

38
00:05:18,345 --> 00:05:21,761
- Maybe you should go to the hospital--
- Please.

39
00:05:23,674 --> 00:05:25,777
Please just leave me alone.

40
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:21,727
Inmate 155.
It's time for your medical examination.

41
00:06:21,727 --> 00:06:24,556
- No...
- Let go of me!

42
00:06:24,556 --> 00:06:26,472
Don't go!

43
00:06:26,614 --> 00:06:30,489
<i>My life in there
was very straightforward.</i>

44
00:06:31,268 --> 00:06:32,467
<i>I ate.</i>

45
00:06:32,467 --> 00:06:34,251
<i>I slept.</i>

46
00:06:34,251 --> 00:06:35,705
<i>I prayed.</i>

47
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:38,349
<i>And I practiced dying.</i>

48
00:06:39,523 --> 00:06:43,917
<i>Everyone dies. There's nothing to fear.</i>

49
00:06:43,917 --> 00:06:46,547
<i>I brainwashed myself endlessly.</i>

50
00:06:46,547 --> 00:06:48,605
<i>And every chance I got</i>

51
00:06:48,605 --> 00:06:52,806
<i>I cried out loud to God to open
up the gates of heaven for me.</i>

52
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:58,893
<i>God answered my prayer
in a completely unexpected way.</i>

53
00:06:59,667 --> 00:07:03,203
<i>When I was struggling to keep
from drowning in the swamp</i>

54
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:10,527
<i>God sent Eulji Hae Yi my way
as the last lifeboat.</i>

55
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,300
- What are you doing?
- Stay still.

56
00:08:39,428 --> 00:08:41,017
Let's go to the hospital.

57
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:44,319
I...

58
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:47,661
I'm okay, sir...

59
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,385
Big Sister.

60
00:08:52,385 --> 00:08:54,668
You're scaring me.

61
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,999
<i>"Big Sister"?</i>

62
00:08:56,999 --> 00:08:59,363
<i>Is he Eulji Hae Yi's younger brother?</i>

63
00:08:59,363 --> 00:09:03,926
This is proof that
you're not okay, Honey.

64
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:05,695
<i>"Honey"?</i>

65
00:09:05,695 --> 00:09:08,354
<i>Who is he?</i>

66
00:09:08,354 --> 00:09:11,100
If something happens to you...

67
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,127
I really got scared that
I'd have to care for you forever.

68
00:09:44,099 --> 00:09:45,288
Here!

69
00:09:45,288 --> 00:09:47,490
Can you bring her to the CT scan room?

70
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:50,008
- She had an electric shock.
- Yes, we were told about it.

71
00:09:50,008 --> 00:09:51,334
Okay.

72
00:09:51,334 --> 00:09:54,298
I'll go check up on Jang Hwa Sa,
and then I'll be back.

73
00:09:54,298 --> 00:09:55,859
Please take care of her.

74
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,409
She's 63 years old and has diabetes.
I suspect that it may be AMI.

75
00:10:04,409 --> 00:10:07,489
She was in cardiac arrest, and had an
electric shock while being defibrillated.

76
00:10:07,489 --> 00:10:10,834
- How long was she in arrest?
- Two to three minutes.

77
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:13,551
It's great that she met a great doctor
within the golden time.

78
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:17,999
It doesn't look like
there's damage to her brain.

79
00:10:17,999 --> 00:10:20,834
Her pulse is good too.
I don't know why she's still unconscious.

80
00:10:20,834 --> 00:10:22,473
Do you think it's from the shock?

81
00:10:22,473 --> 00:10:27,297
It's possible, but we'll have to
run more tests to be sure.

82
00:10:27,816 --> 00:10:30,682
She's an inmate, move her to
a private room on the fourth floor.

83
00:10:30,682 --> 00:10:31,815
Sure.

84
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:48,629
You're up.

85
00:10:50,522 --> 00:10:53,113
I was very worried.

86
00:10:53,594 --> 00:10:57,224
But why am I here?

87
00:10:57,224 --> 00:10:58,604
You don't remember?

88
00:10:58,604 --> 00:11:00,611
You had a heart attack.

89
00:11:00,611 --> 00:11:03,301
A heart attack?

90
00:11:07,523 --> 00:11:09,547
I need to use the bathroom.

91
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:11,143
Hold on.

92
00:11:14,345 --> 00:11:17,008
We're outside, it's protocol.

93
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,524
Is this... the first floor?

94
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,532
What?

95
00:11:47,561 --> 00:11:49,639
What's wrong, Inmate 122?

96
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,194
Say that again.

97
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:09,213
Inmate 122, Jang Hwa Sa.

98
00:12:13,596 --> 00:12:16,109
122...

99
00:12:40,464 --> 00:12:42,273
<i>Are you okay?</i>

100
00:12:45,784 --> 00:12:47,038
No...

101
00:12:48,417 --> 00:12:49,869
No...

102
00:12:50,538 --> 00:12:53,134
That's not me!

103
00:12:53,134 --> 00:12:54,950
No!

104
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:58,250
No!

105
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,556
No!

106
00:13:18,445 --> 00:13:24,229
Did Attorney Eulji... die?

107
00:13:24,229 --> 00:13:25,941
Don't say that.

108
00:13:25,941 --> 00:13:27,374
Why would she die?

109
00:13:28,512 --> 00:13:31,354
Don't worry too much, she's fine.

110
00:13:33,744 --> 00:13:35,795
<i>She's fine?</i>

111
00:13:35,795 --> 00:13:38,172
<i>But I'm here.</i>

112
00:14:10,229 --> 00:14:15,859
<i>You're the one inside my body,
Jang Hwa Sa?</i>

113
00:14:16,459 --> 00:14:20,230
<i>I'm finished if they take me
back to prison like this.</i>

114
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,028
<i>I need to meet Jang Hwa Sa before then.</i>

115
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:24,728
<i>How... how can I meet her?</i>

116
00:14:24,728 --> 00:14:28,812
<i>You need to think, Hae Yi.</i>

117
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:36,965
You think I'll run away?

118
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:39,812
Then stay here for a little bit.

119
00:14:52,915 --> 00:14:55,120
- I ate it all.
- What the heck!

120
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:58,696
Who are you?

121
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:02,067
<i>[Can you talk?]
[It was crazy today.]</i>

122
00:15:02,073 --> 00:15:04,460
<i>[Why, did the inmates throw a riot?]</i>

123
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:09,549
<i>[Are you filming a movie?]</i>

124
00:15:40,798 --> 00:15:42,928
This is it? No more?

125
00:15:48,797 --> 00:15:50,162
What's this?

126
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:52,729
I don't recognize this number.

127
00:15:53,872 --> 00:15:57,332
"This is me, Eulji Hae Yi."

128
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:01,800
"It's urgent, my car is in the outdoor
parking lot at Cheongwon Prison."

129
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,041
Get my spare key and bring my car to the
back entrance of Cheongju Wooil Hospital.

130
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,042
Maybe something happened to her.

131
00:16:10,042 --> 00:16:12,110
There's nothing more urgent than this.

132
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,124
We don't have much time left
before the trial.

133
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:18,100
How can she send me
this message at 1:47 a.m.?

134
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,100
Huh?

135
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,777
I couldn't get in touch with her all day

136
00:16:20,777 --> 00:16:22,964
and she texts me now when
I'm pulling an all-nighter?

137
00:16:22,964 --> 00:16:25,229
I won't go! I can't go!

138
00:16:27,678 --> 00:16:29,384
Wait.

139
00:16:29,384 --> 00:16:30,507
Spare key.

140
00:16:30,507 --> 00:16:33,008
I'll return as soon as
I pick up Attorney Eulji.

141
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:35,330
Get the witness audio file ready
before going home.

142
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,744
Okay, good luck!

143
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:39,925
That's dangerous.

144
00:16:39,925 --> 00:16:43,550
My life is in your hands.

145
00:17:07,669 --> 00:17:10,445
Jang Hwa Sa. Jang Hwa Sa!

146
00:17:11,638 --> 00:17:13,265
Inmate 122!

147
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:18,843
This is insane.

148
00:17:24,036 --> 00:17:28,042
This is Officer Choi.
Chief, where are you?

149
00:17:28,042 --> 00:17:30,350
<i>I'm on standby downstairs. What's wrong?</i>

150
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:33,473
Code red. We have an emergency.

151
00:17:41,222 --> 00:17:43,237
What a relief.

152
00:17:43,237 --> 00:17:45,003
I don't think there's anything wrong.

153
00:17:48,254 --> 00:17:49,507
Why did you change?

154
00:17:49,507 --> 00:17:51,247
You're leaving?

155
00:17:52,567 --> 00:17:55,770
I should go home now, sir.

156
00:17:57,462 --> 00:18:01,848
"I should go home now, sir"?

157
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:07,280
I don't know why
I keep saying these things.

158
00:18:07,957 --> 00:18:10,510
I guess it's because
of the concussion.

159
00:18:14,598 --> 00:18:18,544
What about Jang Hwa Sa?
She didn't die, did she?

160
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:21,517
I heard from the nurse that
she regained consciousness.

161
00:18:27,001 --> 00:18:28,536
You're not going to get it?

162
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:34,840
I bet it's your office.

163
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,042
They're probably worried since
they couldn't reach you all day.

164
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,571
Hello?

165
00:18:52,571 --> 00:18:54,917
<i>Jang Hwa Sa.</i>

166
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,105
Jang Hwa Sa, it's me, Eulji Hae Yi.

167
00:19:04,705 --> 00:19:06,525
You have the wrong number.

168
00:19:08,629 --> 00:19:13,033
<i>I'm the only one who knows
that you're Jang Hwa Sa.</i>

169
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:14,690
We need to meet.

170
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:21,269
When I'm ready, I'll meet you.

171
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:22,918
Wait until then.

172
00:19:22,918 --> 00:19:24,199
Prepared?

173
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:26,098
Prepared for what?

174
00:19:27,713 --> 00:19:30,636
<i>- What do you need to prepare for?
- Hae Yi.</i>

175
00:19:31,307 --> 00:19:32,753
<i>What's wrong?</i>

176
00:19:32,857 --> 00:19:34,491
<i>What's going on?</i>

177
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,324
<i>- What the heck...
- Hae Yi.</i>

178
00:19:37,324 --> 00:19:39,974
<i>You already pretended
to be me in front of Yoo Jin?</i>

179
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:43,800
<i>Right before the Gapjin Cheon tolls</i>

180
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,086
<i>there's a convenience store
called Dandelion.</i>

181
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:49,399
<i>Leave Yoo Jin behind,
and come there right now.</i>

182
00:19:49,995 --> 00:19:52,839
<i>- I'm coming in!
- Answer me.</i>

183
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,051
Who called?

184
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:01,685
Come on.

185
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:05,265
I dropped it while washing my hands.

186
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:15,034
I'm sure it will be okay.
It's waterproof.

187
00:20:22,551 --> 00:20:25,932
You're acting very strange.

188
00:20:28,134 --> 00:20:30,687
I'm sure you don't know.

189
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:35,487
But it would be even more strange
if I were completely normal right now.

190
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:48,247
Let's go home.

191
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,946
I think that would be best.

192
00:20:57,827 --> 00:21:01,350
- Did you find her?
- No.

193
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,615
Inmate 122!

194
00:21:40,742 --> 00:21:42,453
Inmate 122!

195
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:44,414
Jang Hwa Sa!

196
00:21:47,613 --> 00:21:48,953
Hurry!

197
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,225
Hurry!

198
00:21:52,722 --> 00:21:54,236
Inmate 122!

199
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,775
Inmate 122!

200
00:22:01,758 --> 00:22:03,342
Let's go.

201
00:22:05,054 --> 00:22:07,806
I saw guards going back and forth.

202
00:22:08,609 --> 00:22:10,584
I think Jang Hwa Sa ran away.

203
00:22:16,999 --> 00:22:21,327
Granny, this is buy one, get one free.

204
00:22:46,942 --> 00:22:48,296
<i>Bang Soo.</i>

205
00:22:49,623 --> 00:22:53,986
<i>Make a U-turn after the toll, and you'll
see the convenience store we went to.</i>

206
00:22:53,986 --> 00:22:56,909
<i>Park my car on the street
in front of the store.</i>

207
00:22:56,909 --> 00:22:58,481
<i>You can go back to the office.</i>

208
00:22:58,481 --> 00:23:01,459
<i>Leave the spare key
inside the console box.</i>

209
00:23:12,288 --> 00:23:16,567
What happens to an inmate on death row
when they're caught while fleeing?

210
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:20,128
Electric shock... Heart attack...

211
00:23:20,729 --> 00:23:23,375
I'm sure she was in
complete mental shock.

212
00:23:23,701 --> 00:23:25,755
There will be mitigation, right?

213
00:23:27,424 --> 00:23:30,100
<i>Right before the Gapjin Cheon tolls</i>

214
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,242
<i>there's a convenience store
called Dandelion.</i>

215
00:23:32,242 --> 00:23:35,828
<i>Leave Yoo Jin behind,
and come there right now.</i>

216
00:23:36,554 --> 00:23:38,532
Yoo Jin.

217
00:24:33,007 --> 00:24:35,953
Why did you tell me to come
if this is how you're going to react?

218
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:41,220
You have no plans, you're just
staring at me with an open mouth

219
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:43,157
so why did you make me come?

220
00:24:46,716 --> 00:24:48,944
I've seen it with my own eyes now.

221
00:24:51,536 --> 00:24:54,488
Stay with me
until we come up with a plan.

222
00:24:54,488 --> 00:24:58,264
My car will be here
in 5 to 10 minutes.

223
00:24:59,371 --> 00:25:02,577
Let's go out. We'll talk outside.

224
00:25:14,621 --> 00:25:17,439
<i>Wait... Stop right there!</i>

225
00:25:17,439 --> 00:25:19,852
Where are you going?

226
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:20,869
Stop!

227
00:25:20,869 --> 00:25:22,261
- Stop...
- Ms. Jang Hwa Sa.

228
00:25:24,971 --> 00:25:27,390
You may not know who I am.

229
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:29,564
My name is Gi Yoo Jin.

230
00:25:31,795 --> 00:25:32,943
Let go!

231
00:25:32,943 --> 00:25:34,426
- Ms. Jang Hwa Sa.
- Let go.

232
00:25:34,426 --> 00:25:37,144
The medical director
already spoke to the warden.

233
00:25:37,144 --> 00:25:39,890
- They'll give you mitigation.
- Let go!

234
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:43,076
Inmate 122, Jang Hwa Sa!

235
00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:47,075
This won't change anything.

236
00:25:47,075 --> 00:25:50,628
It's safer for you to go back in.
I told you to wait until I come to you.

237
00:25:50,628 --> 00:25:54,184
I know what you're doing.
You can't fool me. Get lost!

238
00:25:55,917 --> 00:25:57,486
Hae Yi!

239
00:25:59,950 --> 00:26:01,430
Hae Yi.

240
00:26:34,345 --> 00:26:36,361
Attorney Eulji.

241
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:38,978
What's going on?
You're not picking up your phone.

242
00:26:38,978 --> 00:26:41,354
If I just leave the car here,
I think they'll tow it away.

243
00:26:41,354 --> 00:26:43,092
Are you okay with that?

244
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:45,844
Attorney!

245
00:26:45,844 --> 00:26:48,215
They're coming at nine o'clock
to tow the car away.

246
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:52,061
- Go ahead without me.
- Okay.

247
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,409
Never mind!

248
00:26:54,409 --> 00:26:55,692
Let's just go.

249
00:26:55,692 --> 00:26:59,369
My gosh, this is so annoying.

250
00:27:02,202 --> 00:27:03,881
Solitary confinement?

251
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:08,459
I understand there are regulations

252
00:27:10,336 --> 00:27:12,977
but she's still not well.

253
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:16,419
I'm sorry, I guess that's not up to me.

254
00:27:17,476 --> 00:27:19,221
Thank you, Young Cheol.

255
00:27:21,302 --> 00:27:23,846
<i>It's three o'clock.</i>

256
00:27:49,146 --> 00:27:51,282
Hang in there.

257
00:27:54,662 --> 00:27:56,908
Shove it up your ass!

258
00:27:58,888 --> 00:28:03,307
If you don't want it, you'll starve.

259
00:28:05,853 --> 00:28:08,036
Let me out.

260
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:09,832
Let me out!

261
00:28:11,452 --> 00:28:13,505
I'm Eulji Hae Yi!

262
00:28:13,505 --> 00:28:16,549
I'm not Jang Hwa Sa.

263
00:28:16,549 --> 00:28:18,562
Let me out!

264
00:28:19,503 --> 00:28:22,742
<i>I'm Eulji Hae Yi! Let me out!</i>

265
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:25,528
Yes, Inmate 122, Jang Hwa Sa!

266
00:28:54,683 --> 00:28:57,988
I had to come out to work,
but I felt bad about leaving you alone.

267
00:28:57,988 --> 00:28:59,739
How are you feeling?

268
00:29:00,827 --> 00:29:02,189
I'm feeling fine.

269
00:29:02,613 --> 00:29:06,910
I've never felt better.

270
00:29:08,365 --> 00:29:12,641
I ordered room service, and delayed
the checkout to four o'clock.

271
00:29:12,641 --> 00:29:16,395
What should I do?
You want me to go there?

272
00:29:16,395 --> 00:29:18,213
No, no.

273
00:29:18,953 --> 00:29:21,376
I can check out.
You don't need to come.

274
00:29:21,376 --> 00:29:25,247
I'll be busy for a while.

275
00:29:25,247 --> 00:29:29,200
I'm going to be very busy,
so let's meet another day.

276
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,200
Bye.

277
00:29:31,208 --> 00:29:33,138
He... hello? Hae Yi.

279
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:08,931
My goodness...

280
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,340
Look how much...

281
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,499
Look how much it's changed.

282
00:30:54,113 --> 00:30:57,065
<i>What I saw when
I opened up the curtains...</i>

283
00:30:58,838 --> 00:31:03,229
<i>was not Seoul, but the passage of time.</i>

284
00:31:04,616 --> 00:31:09,378
<i>In the 34 years that I was just
barely hanging dearly onto my life...</i>

285
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:13,758
<i>the world had changed so much.</i>

286
00:31:14,629 --> 00:31:18,215
<i>I felt an immense hunger
I could not control.</i>

287
00:31:19,562 --> 00:31:25,620
<i>I ate and ate and ate,
and I came to realize something.</i>

288
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:35,786
<i>That I was alive.</i>

289
00:31:37,827 --> 00:31:41,499
<i>I was alive in this world...</i>

290
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,900
<i>with a beating heart.</i>

291
00:33:18,292 --> 00:33:19,747
May I help you?

292
00:33:23,766 --> 00:33:25,211
She's over there.

293
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:34,517
Mom...

294
00:34:03,395 --> 00:34:05,564
I'm here.

295
00:34:07,553 --> 00:34:14,363
As promised, Hwa Sa came to see you.

296
00:34:35,484 --> 00:34:42,212
I wasn't able to celebrate any of your
birthdays with you for the last 34 years.

297
00:34:43,506 --> 00:34:45,033
Open up.

298
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:46,792
No.

299
00:34:46,792 --> 00:34:50,489
I'm really full right now.

300
00:34:50,489 --> 00:34:54,279
Thank you, Ma'am.

301
00:34:59,192 --> 00:35:01,998
I'm the one who's thankful.

302
00:35:01,998 --> 00:35:06,120
Thank you for hanging in there until now.

303
00:35:08,453 --> 00:35:10,881
Thank you for waiting for me.

304
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:13,946
Ma'am.

305
00:35:13,946 --> 00:35:16,047
Why are you crying?

306
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,861
Stop crying.

307
00:35:32,962 --> 00:35:36,893
Do you remember Choo Young Bae?

308
00:35:38,377 --> 00:35:43,428
I brought him home to see you
because we were going to get married.

309
00:35:45,187 --> 00:35:48,638
That man I supposedly killed...

310
00:35:48,638 --> 00:35:50,893
is still alive, I think.

311
00:35:53,522 --> 00:35:55,625
What do you think happened?

312
00:35:58,977 --> 00:36:05,049
Mom, the heavens always have
a reason for everything, right?

313
00:36:05,049 --> 00:36:12,127
So that I can prove he's Choo Young Bae,
the heavens must have allowed this.

314
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:17,585
That's why I must have been
released looking like this, right?

315
00:36:17,585 --> 00:36:23,276
<i>Tight, tight, nice.</i>

316
00:36:23,276 --> 00:36:24,933
<i>Tight, tight, nice.</i>

317
00:36:24,933 --> 00:36:26,797
You sing so well.

318
00:36:26,797 --> 00:36:28,306
<i>Tight, tight, nice.</i>

319
00:36:28,306 --> 00:36:29,991
Who are you?

320
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:43,899
You weren't a classmate from school,
were you?

321
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,163
You're not from
Cheongwon School, are you?

322
00:36:48,094 --> 00:36:49,379
Who are you?

323
00:36:49,379 --> 00:36:52,075
Hwa Sa sent you here
since it's her mom's birthday?

324
00:36:53,694 --> 00:36:59,799
I'm Ms. Jang Hwa Sa's
appeals lawyer, Eulji Hae Yi.

325
00:37:00,899 --> 00:37:02,631
Oh my goodness...

326
00:37:02,631 --> 00:37:06,812
I had no idea you were an attorney.
I'm sorry for speaking that way.

327
00:37:06,812 --> 00:37:08,660
I'm sorry.

328
00:37:09,413 --> 00:37:11,274
Oh, no... Oh, no!

329
00:37:11,564 --> 00:37:13,810
I'm sorry.

330
00:37:15,493 --> 00:37:17,007
I'll be going.

331
00:37:25,379 --> 00:37:28,902
She paid two million won and asked
that she be moved to a private room?

332
00:37:28,902 --> 00:37:32,607
Yes, and she also told me to bill her
for any uncovered expenses.

333
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:37,603
Lawyers don't do anything without money.

334
00:37:37,603 --> 00:37:40,317
Especially the good ones.

335
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,879
Why do I have a bad feeling about this?

336
00:37:59,803 --> 00:38:01,671
Inmate 122, Jang Hwa Sa.

337
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,363
It's not me.

338
00:38:04,363 --> 00:38:08,835
I'm not Jang Hwa Sa.

339
00:38:08,835 --> 00:38:11,701
I said get up, Inmate 122!

340
00:38:11,701 --> 00:38:13,781
Officer Choi!

341
00:38:15,165 --> 00:38:18,879
Jang Hwa Sa. Jang Hwa Sa?

342
00:38:20,098 --> 00:38:22,024
No...

343
00:38:23,071 --> 00:38:26,167
No, I'm not Jang Hwa Sa.

344
00:38:26,712 --> 00:38:30,098
I'm Attorney Eulji Hae Yi.

345
00:38:32,203 --> 00:38:34,600
I'm not Jang Hwa Sa.

346
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:40,877
I'm Attorney Eulji Hae Yi.

347
00:38:42,096 --> 00:38:47,254
- I suspect it may be DID.
- You sure she's not putting on a show?

348
00:38:47,254 --> 00:38:52,056
Knowing she can't get a sentence
reduction or a retrial, she's faking it.

349
00:38:52,056 --> 00:38:53,553
Come on.

350
00:38:53,553 --> 00:38:56,971
Can being electrocuted cause you
to develop a personality disorder?

351
00:38:56,971 --> 00:39:01,330
No, we can't say that
the electric shock was the cause.

352
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:03,886
It could be that her mind
was no longer able to handle it.

353
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:12,613
Then we have no other option
besides Gongju?

354
00:39:37,536 --> 00:39:39,672
- Mister.
- Yes.

355
00:39:39,672 --> 00:39:42,971
Can you take me to this address?

356
00:39:51,435 --> 00:39:53,493
Which one...

357
00:39:54,401 --> 00:39:56,752
<i>That's all nonsense.</i>

358
00:39:57,334 --> 00:39:58,935
Oh, come on!

359
00:39:58,935 --> 00:40:00,750
Open up a door with fingerprints?

360
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:02,582
How can you figure out
the passcode from that?

361
00:40:02,582 --> 00:40:05,966
That's nonsense only possible in movies.

362
00:40:05,966 --> 00:40:08,192
Then how do you do it?

363
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,239
Me?

364
00:40:18,772 --> 00:40:20,238
- Electricity?
- Yeah.

365
00:40:20,238 --> 00:40:21,613
No way.

366
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:30,957
<i>Break-in attempt at
25 Gwansoo-dong, Unit 1301.</i>

367
00:40:30,957 --> 00:40:32,924
<i>Please check immediately.</i>

368
00:40:35,899 --> 00:40:39,346
This is Yeon Joo Young,
I got the radio and I'm on my way.

369
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:44,120
25 Gwansoo-dong?

370
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,714
Oh...

371
00:40:48,678 --> 00:40:50,277
This kid...

372
00:40:50,277 --> 00:40:53,622
He's got no money,
but he always calls at the right time.

373
00:40:53,622 --> 00:40:55,084
Where are you?

374
00:40:55,084 --> 00:40:56,232
If you're done, come.

375
00:40:56,232 --> 00:40:58,634
- He's buying me meat.
- Tell him to come.

376
00:40:58,634 --> 00:41:00,129
There's no time for that.

377
00:41:00,129 --> 00:41:04,053
Remember when you were mad,
and you asked me to break into a house?

378
00:41:04,053 --> 00:41:06,129
The one at 25 Gwansoo-dong?

379
00:41:11,672 --> 00:41:13,308
What about that dumb wench?

380
00:41:14,064 --> 00:41:15,131
Here!

381
00:41:18,491 --> 00:41:20,866
I can't believe I'm doing this.

382
00:41:21,935 --> 00:41:24,000
What if I get punished?

383
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,198
- Just drive.
- Oh...

384
00:41:27,926 --> 00:41:29,993
You can leave now.

385
00:41:29,993 --> 00:41:32,658
- Okay.
- It sounds weird to anyone.

386
00:41:32,658 --> 00:41:35,285
Who would break into
their own house with a taser?

387
00:41:36,551 --> 00:41:39,178
Only a pro would know how to do that.

388
00:41:39,178 --> 00:41:41,712
Take her to the station,
you should investigate.

389
00:41:41,712 --> 00:41:44,855
I don't know why
you're dressed like it's the 1980s.

390
00:41:44,855 --> 00:41:47,930
But I know it's you,
Attorney Eulji Hae Yi.

391
00:41:51,161 --> 00:41:54,343
I'm done confirming her identity.

392
00:41:54,343 --> 00:41:55,435
Okay.

393
00:41:57,990 --> 00:42:00,770
If you do this again, I have no
choice but to report you.

394
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:01,895
Okay.

395
00:42:06,618 --> 00:42:08,544
Come on.

396
00:42:10,045 --> 00:42:13,975
I helped you out through that situation

397
00:42:13,975 --> 00:42:17,730
so can't you at least
get me a cup of iced coffee?

398
00:42:19,753 --> 00:42:21,415
Why is it so dark?

399
00:42:21,415 --> 00:42:24,565
Light... Oh, here.

400
00:42:25,799 --> 00:42:30,614
<i>What is her relation to this man?</i>

401
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:35,815
As I told you, Officer.
I was in an accident.

402
00:42:35,815 --> 00:42:38,514
I know, I understand you almost died...

403
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,846
I can understand forgetting
the passcode due to concussion

404
00:42:40,846 --> 00:42:43,895
but how could you forget me,
Oh Bong Sam?

405
00:42:45,355 --> 00:42:47,290
Oh Bong Sam...

406
00:42:48,882 --> 00:42:52,092
You're laughing?
What are you doing?

407
00:42:52,536 --> 00:42:54,208
Oh Bong...

408
00:42:54,208 --> 00:42:56,545
Sam...

409
00:42:56,886 --> 00:42:59,201
Making fun of my name?

410
00:42:59,906 --> 00:43:01,516
I'm sorry.

411
00:43:01,516 --> 00:43:02,581
What's this?

412
00:43:02,581 --> 00:43:07,268
Are you doing this to me
because of the DUI incident?

413
00:43:07,268 --> 00:43:09,148
No.

414
00:43:09,148 --> 00:43:11,101
No, Officer.

415
00:43:11,170 --> 00:43:14,755
Where's the bathroom?
It's so big, I can't find anything.

416
00:43:14,755 --> 00:43:16,290
Where is it?

417
00:43:18,234 --> 00:43:19,600
That way...

418
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,100
- Here?
- Yes.

419
00:44:16,864 --> 00:44:18,299
What's this?

420
00:44:18,299 --> 00:44:20,877
Why is the number 78, and not 77?

421
00:44:21,697 --> 00:44:23,489
Where is 77?

422
00:44:41,049 --> 00:44:43,313
I thought you were going to the bathroom.

423
00:44:43,313 --> 00:44:46,114
Oh, I was looking around the house.

424
00:44:46,697 --> 00:44:50,904
When would an average guy like me ever
get a chance to visit a house like this?

425
00:44:53,547 --> 00:44:57,342
This is iced coffee?

426
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,759
Coffee isn't good for you
to drink at night.

427
00:44:59,759 --> 00:45:01,163
Oh, I see...

428
00:45:05,098 --> 00:45:06,907
It's honey water.

429
00:45:06,907 --> 00:45:09,177
- Sugar...
- Sugar?

430
00:45:10,699 --> 00:45:12,360
Yeah...

431
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,402
Sugar water is the best
when you're tired.

432
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:20,500
So sweet.

433
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:24,281
- You don't need to walk me out...
- I should say goodbye.

434
00:45:30,855 --> 00:45:34,252
You're not Eulji Hae Yi, right?

435
00:45:37,944 --> 00:45:40,784
Face off.
Dissociative identity disorder.

436
00:45:40,784 --> 00:45:42,264
Which one is it?

437
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,641
So what if you're a cop?
What the hell are you saying?

438
00:45:53,826 --> 00:45:55,337
Cute.

439
00:46:12,134 --> 00:46:13,900
Does she not eat?

440
00:46:29,118 --> 00:46:31,275
Were they going to get married?

441
00:46:46,453 --> 00:46:48,185
What's this?

442
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,161
<i>[Jang Hwa Sa]</i>

443
00:47:03,161 --> 00:47:05,004
<i>[Case Vehicle]</i>

444
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,600
<i>[Choo Young Bae]</i>

445
00:47:12,995 --> 00:47:15,679
<i>[Gi Se Woong, Gi San, Jang Hwa Sa]</i>

446
00:47:31,811 --> 00:47:33,830
You're...

447
00:47:37,681 --> 00:47:40,159
Gi San?

448
00:47:45,431 --> 00:47:48,159
Choo Young Bae's older half-brother?

449
00:47:50,715 --> 00:47:54,071
And the eldest son of
Chairman Gi Se Woong?

450
00:48:01,830 --> 00:48:04,058
No.

451
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:07,306
You're Choo Young Bae.

452
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:12,058
Choo Young Bae.

453
00:48:18,085 --> 00:48:21,324
He's a private investigator
that Yoo Jin hired.

454
00:48:21,324 --> 00:48:23,831
He used to work for the homicide
department at Jungwon Police Station.

455
00:48:29,299 --> 00:48:31,518
- That's Eulji Hae Yi?
- Yes.

456
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,484
According to the corrections officer

457
00:48:38,484 --> 00:48:41,496
he's volunteered to work
at the medical ward.

458
00:48:42,027 --> 00:48:45,511
Yoo Jin's gone to prison
to meet Jang Hwa Sa...

459
00:48:45,511 --> 00:48:50,368
And his girlfriend is
Jang Hwa Sa's appeals lawyer.

460
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:55,855
It's Cheongwon Prison. I'll answer.

461
00:48:58,107 --> 00:48:59,799
Go ahead.

462
00:48:59,799 --> 00:49:02,596
I heard she's the daughter
of Prosecutor Eulji Sung.

463
00:49:02,596 --> 00:49:06,275
Why did she have to be
connected with Jang Hwa Sa?

464
00:49:06,275 --> 00:49:08,109
Okay.

465
00:49:09,181 --> 00:49:11,817
Did Jang Hwa Sa die or something?

466
00:49:12,268 --> 00:49:16,889
She attempted to escape
from the hospital and was caught.

467
00:49:16,889 --> 00:49:20,572
- Escape?
- They suspect she has DID...

468
00:49:20,572 --> 00:49:23,188
a personality disorder.

469
00:49:44,154 --> 00:49:46,100
<i>She's gone crazy?</i>

470
00:49:46,100 --> 00:49:47,889
<i>She's crazy.</i>

471
00:49:47,889 --> 00:49:54,201
<i>Hwa Sa, wouldn't it have been better
if you had just died back then?</i>

472
00:51:16,089 --> 00:51:20,784
<i>You stayed quietly as
a death row inmate for 34 years.</i>

473
00:51:20,784 --> 00:51:23,326
<i>So why...</i>

474
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:41,407
<i>Why did you become crazy
and try to escape from there?</i>

475
00:52:04,766 --> 00:52:06,828
Choo Young Bae.

476
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:12,737
Choo Young Bae!

477
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:23,869
Who's there?

478
00:52:29,866 --> 00:52:31,802
Stop right there!

479
00:52:42,096 --> 00:52:43,788
Are you okay?

480
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,761
<i>Wait up!</i>

481
00:53:26,859 --> 00:53:28,165
Stop right there!

482
00:53:51,346 --> 00:53:52,833
Who are you?

483
00:53:56,279 --> 00:53:58,221
Come out!

484
00:53:58,221 --> 00:54:00,418
Come out right now!

485
00:54:01,723 --> 00:54:03,708
Damn...

486
00:54:07,056 --> 00:54:09,627
Who the hell are you?

487
00:54:09,627 --> 00:54:11,366
Who the hell...

488
00:54:12,842 --> 00:54:15,605
<i>You need to eat mudfish
on a hot day like today.</i>

489
00:54:18,699 --> 00:54:22,076
I'm not trying to act cute,
but I really don't know how to eat this.

490
00:54:22,076 --> 00:54:23,906
You'll grow to like it.

491
00:54:23,906 --> 00:54:27,007
This is how my mom got my dad hooked.

492
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:31,960
Your dad must be someone great
if your mother had to chase after him.

493
00:54:32,529 --> 00:54:33,902
Gi Se Woong.

494
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,355
Who?

495
00:54:39,139 --> 00:54:42,165
Gi Se Woong.
The president of your company.

496
00:54:43,277 --> 00:54:45,105
That's my dad.

497
00:55:02,152 --> 00:55:04,560
<i>It can't be Hwa Sa...</i>

498
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:06,793
<i>It can't be...</i>

499
00:55:08,857 --> 00:55:10,627
<i>Who could it be?</i>

500
00:55:10,627 --> 00:55:17,828
<i>Who would call me Choo Young Bae?</i>

501
00:55:43,697 --> 00:55:46,900
What's gotten into you?
I couldn't even get in touch with you.

502
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:51,462
What's happening to you?

503
00:55:59,514 --> 00:56:01,900
I got a call from Cheongwon.

504
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:05,163
Jang Hwa Sa will be
transferred to Gongju Prison.

505
00:56:35,699 --> 00:56:36,940
Wait.

506
00:56:40,029 --> 00:56:42,217
What's this supposed to be?

507
00:56:42,217 --> 00:56:44,634
These are Inmate 122's belongings.

508
00:56:44,634 --> 00:56:47,449
<i>- No, if I get dragged out like this...</i>
- Let's go.

509
00:56:47,449 --> 00:56:50,134
<i>- I'll never be able to get my body back.</i>
- Hold on.

510
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:55,980
Jang Hwa Sa, I had no idea
we'd have to send you away like this.

511
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,770
Why am I going to Gongju?

512
00:56:58,371 --> 00:57:00,855
That's where the crazies go.

513
00:57:00,855 --> 00:57:02,938
You said you're Attorney Eulji Hae Yi.

514
00:57:02,938 --> 00:57:07,100
You don't even know who you are.
You don't think you're crazy?

515
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:09,179
- Take her.
- Okay.

516
00:57:10,081 --> 00:57:13,009
No, I never agreed to be transferred.

517
00:57:13,009 --> 00:57:14,672
I may be an inmate

518
00:57:14,672 --> 00:57:17,994
but you're violating my rights
by transferring me without my consent.

519
00:57:18,753 --> 00:57:20,723
I'll report this.

520
00:57:20,723 --> 00:57:23,500
I'm not going! I can't go!

521
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:25,929
I'll report all of you!

522
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:37,438
Jang Hwa Sa!

523
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:42,351
Inmate 122!

524
00:57:56,029 --> 00:57:57,969
You did this?

525
00:57:57,969 --> 00:58:01,299
You put me into that mental institute?

526
00:58:01,299 --> 00:58:04,699
