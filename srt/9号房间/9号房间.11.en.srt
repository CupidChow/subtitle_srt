00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,750
Why are you trying to kill me?

181
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:58,640
Chan Sung is in jail.

182
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,000
Do you need another reason?

183
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,590
CEO, it wasn't me.

184
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:05,000
Jang Hwa Sa's the one who gave the <br>black box footage to the police.

185
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,390
That very Jang Hwa Sa <br>was at your house.

186
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,110
It's a misunderstanding.

187
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:12,950
I can explain everything.

188
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:15,930
My son Chan Sung is in jail!

189
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:17,980
Ki San's son, Ki Chan Sung

190
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,450
is a wreck...

191
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,040
and struggling!

192
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:23,850
CEO, please save me.

193
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:28,070
If you retract the witness,<br> I'll take care of everything else.

194
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:31,060
There wasn't a time when<br>I wasn't on your side.

195
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,130
Not once...

196
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,070
did I betray you.

197
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,260
Nonetheless, you're the one <br>who killed Ma Hyun Cheol.

198
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,050
It was Jang Hwa Sa.

199
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:49,760
The one who killed Director Ma...

200
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,440
is Jang Hwa Sa?

201
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,110
It may be hard to believe...

202
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:56,800
but Director Ma was like you at first.

203
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,310
Even I don't know why Jang Hwa Sa...

204
00:15:00,310 --> 00:15:02,300
killed Director Ma.

205
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,680
At first,

206
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:09,240
I thought Jang Hwa Sa who was in <br>my body, did it to hide her identity...

207
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,650
but that may not be all.

208
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:13,360
The fact that...

209
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,310
Director Ma was her public defender...

210
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,050
might be the reason.

211
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,070
So?

212
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,710
So...

213
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:25,330
if you retract the witness statement...

214
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:28,840
I'll get your son's warrant <br>dismissed and get him out.

215
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,740
No, no. I'm not talking about <br>Chan Sung right now.

216
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,980
So...

217
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:38,000
who are you right now?

218
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,790
Jang Hwa Sa?

219
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:46,890
I'm Eulji Hae Yi.

220
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,910
You were Eulji Hae Yi, <br>then Jang Hwa Sa...

221
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:54,680
and now you're Eulji Hae Yi.

222
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:58,390
You must've been busy.

223
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:00,420
I'm speechless.

224
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:02,240
Why the change had occurred

225
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,250
and why the change back occurred...

226
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,410
I can't explain it scientifically, but...

227
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:12,090
I've already let go of your hand.

228
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,790
CEO.

229
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,450
What? Punk.

230
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,250
[ Evidence B 238 ]

231
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,070
10:50.

232
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,130
Based on the report,

233
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,730
the time of death is between <br>11:00 p.m. to 12 a.m.

234
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,150
You entered Ma Hyun Cheol's room, <br>but no footage of you leaving.

235
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,950
How can you explain this?

236
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,270
You should know.

237
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,080
This isn't enough to prove murder.

238
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,400
<i>Is she a stuntman or something?</i>

239
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,050
She jumped from the 9th floor balcony <br>down to the 8th floor balcony?

240
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:35,210
Thud.

241
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,940
It wasn't an object, but it <br>was a "cushioned" sound.

242
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,580
I had a feeling that...

243
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,110
it was a person.

244
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:50,640
<i>On the day of the murder,</i>

245
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,960
<i>when I questioned you <br>at the San Hae resort...</i>

246
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,410
<i>you said you didn't hear <br>or see anything.</i>

247
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:58,830
You also said there was no <br>security footage, didn't you?

248
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,830
This case closed a while ago.

249
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:05,190
Why are you making a testimony now?

250
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,210
Why is that important?

251
00:18:08,210 --> 00:18:10,670
He's being a model citizen.

252
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:12,580
You better stay quiet.

253
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,350
What's the motive for murder?

254
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,200
It's from the NFS.

255
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:31,860
Good work.

256
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:38,100
Blood type B.

257
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,110
Based on 16 DNA tests

258
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,950
it's a 99.7% match.

259
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:44,480
It matches the blood on the towel.

260
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,990
So what?

261
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:53,000
You didn't find the towel <br>in Director Ma's room.

262
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:00,640
<i>I'm in charge of the 9th floor VIP rooms.</i>

263
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,520
<i>In the suite rooms, <br>there are four bath towels,</i>

264
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,060
<i>seven regular towels,</i>

265
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,880
<i>and six hand towels.</i>

266
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,610
<i>One of the bath towels was missing.</i>

267
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,130
<i>I thought the police took it.</i>

268
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,020
<i>Oh, the shower cap, too.</i>

269
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,480
<i>Since men have short hair,</i>

270
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,790
<i>maybe 1 in a 100 of them <br>use a shower cap.</i>

271
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:21,720
<i>It wasn't in the trash, either.</i>

272
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,760
This is what I think.

273
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,910
This is when you got cut by the glass.

274
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,160
<i>It wasn't in the trash, either.</i>

275
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:40,040
Eulji Hae Yi.

276
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,960
I honestly want to help you.

277
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,460
How?

278
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,740
The truth.

279
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,670
You won't believe me even if I tell you.

280
00:19:52,670 --> 00:19:54,780
The only way for you to live is...

281
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:56,890
to cooperate with the investigation.

282
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,510
Self-defense or involuntary manslaughter.

283
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:03,720
The answer must be one of these two.

284
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,530
Let me use my cell phone just once.

285
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:25,200
The six senior partners present here...

286
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,950
will partake in Ki Chan Sung's <br>case as co-attorneys.

287
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:33,620
This is Attorney Eul's case. <br>What is the company's stance regarding her?

288
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,940
If she's not guilty, she'll be <br>released in 48 hours.

289
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,310
But if the charges are true...

290
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,450
no scandal can be worse than this.

291
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:45,860
No one is to get involved in<br> Attorney Eul's business.

292
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,250
May I dare...

293
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:51,400
inquire something as <br>Attorney Eul's associate lawyer?

294
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,610
Will she return to work <br>if found innocent?

295
00:20:56,510 --> 00:21:01,360
What kills a person <br>isn't a fact, but a rumor.

296
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,220
"She killed Director Ma."

297
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,560
"What could be the reason"?

298
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,940
"Sexual harassment"?

299
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:07,950
"Were they having an affair"?

300
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,630
With rumors like these

301
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,870
following an attorney, <br>what client will trust her, and

302
00:21:12,870 --> 00:21:15,130
what Judge will think well of her?

303
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:17,640
- Huh?<br><i>- The fool from Jo Eun Police Dept. is calling.</i>

304
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,280
<i>Master, don't answer the phone.</i>

305
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,330
<i>The fool from Jo Eun <br>Police Dept. is calling.</i>

306
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:22,380
<i>Master, don't answer the phone.</i>

307
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,960
- I'm sorry.<br>- Answer it.

308
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,770
<i>The fool from Jo Eun Police Dept. <br>is calling. Master, don't answer...</i>

309
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,220
It's Bang Sang Soo.

310
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,490
<i>It's me, Eulji Hae Yi.</i>

311
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:32,420
Officer Oh Bong Sam.

312
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:36,270
If you're calling regarding Attorney Eulji, <br>summon me as a witness.

313
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,550
Bang Sang Soo.

314
00:21:51,550 --> 00:21:53,740
Get Han Yun Hee and go to <br>Hyeseungpo right away.

315
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,010
The San Hae Resort's VIP room maid...

316
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:56,950
<i>Hae Yi.</i>

317
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:58,980
I...

318
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,510
I can't help you.

319
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:03,130
"Don't get involved in <br>Attorney Eul's business."

320
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,090
Official orders from the firm.

321
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,560
So Kim Jong Soon said that, right?

322
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:15,050
You were the last in our class, <br>yet I hired you as my associate.

323
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,440
Help me.

324
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,570
I'll repay you for sure.

325
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,090
- I'm Eulji Hae...<br>- Yes.

326
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,320
You're 100% victory rate, Eulji Hae Yi.

327
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:26,380
You will handle it well by yourself.

328
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,630
You must've been <br>disgruntled this whole time.

329
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:33,100
Thought I'd done my best.

330
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,350
But it's a firm.

331
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:35,740
There's a hierarchy and...

332
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:36,680
When you get out...

333
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,820
I'll buy you soju.

334
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:43,330
Call Jang Hwa Sa or at least <br>Kam Mi Ran for me!

335
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:46,000
Is it that hard to call someone?

336
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
You went through a lot together as <br>her associate. You're being too harsh.

337
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,790
What about you Detective?

338
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:55,530
Is it okay to lend your phone to a suspect?

339
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:58,080
What if she calls <br>asking to hide evidence?

340
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:04,350
Wow. He's so cold-hearted.

341
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,560
Attorney Eul is not here.

342
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,060
What about Jang Hwa Sa?

343
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,590
She's here.

344
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,050
I came to confirm something.

345
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:44,480
The person you saw under hypnosis...

346
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,110
Is it him?

347
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,250
Where did you find this?

348
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,410
It wasn't in the evidence room.

349
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,100
Is it the same person?

350
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:08,570
Seeing this picture, he <br>resembles you even more.

351
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,910
How did...

352
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,810
Chu Young Bae become Ki San?

353
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:19,700
I didn't see it with my own eyes, but...

354
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,060
I'm certain of it.

355
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,210
That Chu Young Bae...

356
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,840
killed Ki San.

357
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,220
Even if that's the case...

358
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:38,050
how could Chu Young Bae <br>become Ki San?

359
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,760
CEO Ki Se Woong...

360
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:45,050
wanted to turn San Hae Group <br>into a global company.

361
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,920
So, once Ki San had...

362
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,660
finished grade school, <br>he was sent to the US.

363
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:54,190
And everyone who saw the adult Ki San...

364
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,040
was in the US.

365
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,070
Morgan Kim who was <br>killed by Ki Chan Sung,

366
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,010
and Esther, who could be your mother.

367
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,770
I want to know, too.

368
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:13,750
How Chu Young Bae became Ki San.

369
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,430
That answer...

370
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,530
Chu Young Bae and <br>CEO Ki Se Woong...

371
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:23,050
are the only ones who know.

372
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:57,240
San.

373
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,980
San.

374
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,520
San.

375
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,370
You don't have to forgive me.

376
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:34,100
Just let me live.

377
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,450
Father.

378
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,750
Please, let me...

379
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:08,550
I won't die like this.

380
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,080
I won't die in your hands!

381
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,840
I'd rather be executed.

382
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,520
Just wait.

383
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,360
I'll reveal everything in court.

384
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:22,280
Chu Young Bae, the illegitimate<br> son of Ki Se Woong...

385
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,000
murdered the precious heir <br>of San Hae Group who returned

386
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,910
from his studies in the US!

387
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:33,010
Lower your voice.

388
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:35,060
It's night patrol time.

389
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,720
CEO.

390
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,290
CEO Ki Se Woong.

391
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,140
Then Grandfather...

392
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:03,030
made Chu Young Bae into Ki San?

393
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,150
Not sure.

394
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:08,830
We can only suspect.

395
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,340
No, how...

396
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:13,600
How...

397
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,990
can someone kill his older brother...

398
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:23,420
and the father stay quiet about it?

399
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,120
There must've been a reason.

400
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:33,860
<i>There must've been a reason why...</i>

401
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,970
<i>CEO Ki Se Woong staying quiet.</i>

402
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:39,270
<i>To protect the company?</i>

403
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,780
<i>To CEO, San Hae Group was...</i>

404
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:45,110
<i>like Ki Se Woong himself.</i>

405
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:14,500
Bloodlines are like that.

406
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:17,870
It instantly heats up...

407
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:21,250
and instantly breaks your heart.

408
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,460
Shouldn't you...

409
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,090
avenge your father?

410
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,930
You must get back SHC Group, too.

411
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:41,670
It's rightfully yours, Doctor Ki.

412
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,610
I'll help you.

413
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:09,190
Oh, it's Yoo Jin.

414
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:14,600
You have great timing.

415
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,440
You're blessed when it comes to food.

416
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,950
Here.

417
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,630
How about some soju?

418
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:35,120
You were waiting for me?

419
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,520
Have a drink.

420
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,420
Wow. It's amazing.

421
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:58,330
Ah.

422
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:12,800
Côte d’Ivoire Abidjan General Hospital.

423
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,100
It's San Hae's contract hospital.

424
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,160
Go there for a year as a team leader.

425
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,020
Incheon to Dubai.

426
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,800
Dubai to Abidjan.

427
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,670
It's tomorrow morning.

428
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:25,930
There's not much time.

429
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:28,610
Why should a man temporize before leaving?

430
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:33,300
Is there a reason you need to get rid of me?

431
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,630
You lived and ate well for the sole reason of being my younger brother.

432
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:39,640
There has to be a cost for that.

433
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,350
The company is still chaotic because of Chan Sung.

434
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:45,120
This will be good marketing.

435
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,940
We're going to volunteer in Africa

436
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,160
as a way to bring up the company's fallen image.

437
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:57,650
Eulji Hae Yi was arrested.

438
00:32:02,550 --> 00:32:04,150
Hyungnim, is it your doing?

439
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:05,500
Are you doing this to Hae Yi to get me to leave...

440
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,990
She killed Ma Hyun Cheol.

441
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:11,560
No one in our family

442
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,200
can get tied up in a scandal again.

443
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,030
You stay away from all this chaos.

444
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,820
Where is Hae Yi?

445
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:23,440
Go abroad for just one year.

446
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,890
I'll take care of everything during that time.

447
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:29,120
It must be either Hyeseungpo or Jo Eun police department.

448
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:33,770
You can kill a person the same way

449
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:37,590
but one person will be sentenced to life imprisonment, the other for 15 years,

450
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,640
the other a year or even probation.

451
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,300
That's power.

452
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,090
That's the power of money and authority.

453
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,170
Are you threatening me?

454
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:56,240
Go to Abidjan.

455
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,730
That's how you can help Attorney Eulji.

456
00:32:58,730 --> 00:33:00,580
If you leave quietly

457
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:03,550
Damjang will help Eulji Hae Yi.

458
00:33:08,070 --> 00:33:09,450
Yoo Jin.

459
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,990
Yoo Jin!

460
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,560
Move.

461
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,940
- What's going on?<br>- We'll escort you home.

462
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,410
Let go.

463
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,500
Let go.

464
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,550
Let go.

465
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:57,970
Let go, you a*******!

466
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:05,270
Let go.

467
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:06,470
I said, let go!

468
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:24,750
There isn't much time, so hurry and order something.

469
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,790
I want blood sausage soup.

470
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,110
Me, too.

471
00:34:27,110 --> 00:34:28,700
<i>Me, too.</i>

472
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,630
<i>Me, too.</i>

473
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:31,520
Hyung. Extra large?

474
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,410
I want pizza with salad.

475
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,760
You...

476
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,480
Are you crazy?

477
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,070
Just go with blood sausage stew.

478
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,280
Six bowls of blood sausage stew.

479
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,660
I'm serious.

480
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,760
The weather is getting cold and it's making me crave salad.

481
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,090
I'm craving cola, too.

482
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:51,910
You know the one with zero calories?

483
00:34:51,910 --> 00:34:53,670
Get me that one.

484
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:59,120
Can't I eat what I want?

485
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,430
[ Excessive bleeding from the skull? ]

00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,170
[ Jang Hwa Sa - Ma Hyun Cheol public defender ]

487
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,530

488
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:31,640
Unni, come outside.

489
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:34,180
Unni, you have a guest.

490
00:35:44,050 --> 00:35:45,510
Hello.

491
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:49,640
Are you Jang Hwa Sa who was released on a stay of execution?

492
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:53,130
I read the notice that was sent regarding your stay of execution.

493
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,790
What are you doing here?

494
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,690
Hae Yi isn't home yet.

495
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:02,400
Attorney Eul wants to see you.

496
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,510
She's at Jo Eun police department...

497
00:36:04,510 --> 00:36:07,400
if it's okay with you, can you come with me?

498
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,500
What happened to Hae Yi?

499
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,840
Is it Ma Hyun Cheol? Ki Chan Sung?

500
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,050
What is it?

501
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,510
Jang Hwa Sa.

502
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:45,280
Yes?

503
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,340
Is grandma okay?

504
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:51,210
I ate chicken soup with her, and she was very startled that day.

505
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:53,940
I worried a lot while taking her to the nursing home.

506
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:55,420
She's okay.

507
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,660
She's okay, thanks to you.

508
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,450
That's a relief.

509
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,330
- Can I get that for you?<i>- It's alright.</i>

510
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,250
Jang Hwa Sa!

511
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,200
Team Leader, come outside for a minute.

512
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,100
What?

513
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,370
She brought a change of clothes. Come outside.

514
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,990
You come outside, too.

515
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:41,770
Hey, let's go talk.

516
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,890
Do you know how I made this career?

517
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:49,440
Do you know how I've come this far?

518
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,020
I...

519
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,960
fall apart here...

520
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,300
I'm going to kill you with my own hands.

521
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,610
Your wish will come true soon...

522
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,750
There's no time...

523
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,250
tell me everything that happened that night.

524
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:07,090
I have a good memory, so you don't have to tell me twice.

525
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:08,860
At San Hae Resort...

526
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:11,590
after Director Ma called Yoo Jin...

527
00:38:12,810 --> 00:38:16,330
Whether she was targeted by CEO Ki San because of Ki Chan Sung's case...

528
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:19,980
all the evidence appoints her as Ma Hyun Cheol's killer.

529
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,740
Why are you ignoring the evidence?

530
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:23,620
That's why it's driving me insane.

531
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:27,400
Have you ever seen motive besides money, passion, jealousy?

532
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,670
The evidence, witness,

533
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:31,650
everything points to Eulji Hae Yi.

534
00:38:31,650 --> 00:38:34,230
But there's no motive.

535
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,300
The more I question her

536
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,650
the more I see that she isn't the suspect.

537
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,590
He poured me a glass of whiskey...

538
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,500
How much did you drink?
