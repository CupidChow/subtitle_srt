Are you really...

5
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,250
Why? Did you fall for me?

6
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:15,430
It's a Times article I read on a business trip to NY.

7
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,400
There was a car explosion in Seattle.

8
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:22,630
They were a newlyweds and the wife was rescued late.

9
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:26,420
She had third-degree burns all over with 55% skin loss.

They've been married for 10 years now.

The husband is amazing.

12
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,660
But the wife filed for divorce.

Asking to separate from her husband.

14
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,850
They're both touching, but why are they trying to separate?

15
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,940
Aren't they hypocrites? Or after the insurance payout?

16
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,890
Third-degree burns and 55%.

17
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,860
The husband's young with raging hormones.

18
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,950
Is it possible?

19
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,600
Yoo Jin, is it possible for you?

20
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,100
Sexual desire is proof of evolution,

21
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,200
so it'd be hard to overcome.

22
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,890
It's possible to sleep with another woman, but...

23
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,100
love is a different story.

24
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,000
I can love my wife forever just like that husband did.

or get any tests done?

39
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,050
Elevated liver enzymes and a mass in the pancreatic duct.

40
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:53,770
- If it's not a gallstone, you must run a CT.
- That's right!

But why the heck...

It's stage four pancreatic cancer with multiple metastasis.
<i>[ Multiple metastasis - The spread of cancer cells to new areas ]</i>

52
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,930
Depending on the patient's condition, we should start chemo or radiation.

53
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,220
But there's a limit.

54
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,200
We may have to use morphine just to control her symptoms.

- Why do they feed a patient like this?
- It's prison rules.

364
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,880
A guard brings three packed meals in the morning.

365
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:31,060
We shouldn't use tax money to buy hospital food.

366
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:39,000
I think I've found a way.

367
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,200
- Me and Jang Hwa Sa?
- Yes.

368
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,240
To get your body back from ♪122.

369
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:51,400
What is it?

370
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,900
The defibrillator.

371
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,460
I already tried the defibrillator.

372
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,600
Hae Yi, when you did it...

373
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,310
<i>there was you,</i>

374
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,720
<i>Jang Hwa Sa,</i>

375
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,830
<i>inmate 822, and the defibrillator.</i>

376
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:14,230
During the first change...

377
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,460
<i>- Yoo Jin...
- Let's talk later.</i>

378
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:19,360
<i>Inmate 122! You, Jang Hwa Sa,</i>

379
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,740
<i>defibrillator...</i>

380
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,330
<i>and me.</i>

381
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,200
I might be the missing key.

382
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:29,440
No, it is me.

383
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,590
I'm sure of it.

384
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,060
The defibrillator can cause cardiac dysrhythmia

385
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,930
or burns from the electricity.

386
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,260
But you must trust me and give it a go.

387
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,100
Okay.

388
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Okay, whatever the side effects are...

389
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,700
can't be as bad as pancreatic cancer.

390
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,070
Even if there's a 0.1% chance...

391
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,790
<i>Goodbye.</i>

392
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,000
They threw away that defibrillator.

393
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,100
Yes, it's Ki Yoo Jin.

394
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,600
I'm positive.

395
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,400
Yes. There are people who collect this stuff.

396
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,900
They collect junk. Strange taste.

397
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:18,890
Yes, yes. I negotiated with the collector.

398
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:22,120
Doctor, you don't need to go.

399
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,780
It's in Yeosu.

400
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,290
I'll bring it back in one piece.

401
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,350
Okay.

402
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,900
How will you bring Jang Hwa Sa here?

403
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,700
I'll bring her here.

404
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,230
I'm asking how?

405
00:29:35,230 --> 00:29:39,150
Will you tell her, "I've found a way, let's go switch back"?

406
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:40,680
My words may be different.

407
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:45,600
Yoo Jin, if it was you, would you return it?

408
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,310
Of course, she should.

409
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:51,840
Yoo Jin, you're so naive at times like this.

410
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,940
Go and ask anybody.

411
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,740
A death row inmate with terminal pancreatic cancer.

412
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:00,090
Would they switch bodies? Not even one in a million.

413
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,500
All of them would flee...

414
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,310
out of the country.

415
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,900
Then what should we do?

416
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,400
She doesn't know that you know,

417
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,300
so act clueless and go see her.

418
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,100
Use sleeping pills or something,

419
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,030
since you're a doctor.

420
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,500
It'd be best to bring her when she's unconscious.

421
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:31,100
As you said, because I'm a doctor,

422
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,500
I'll bring her in a conscientious way.

423
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,800
Don't say anything.

424
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,200
Bring her using whatever method,

425
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,620
but don't tell her about the pancreatic cancer.

I think we can proceed as stated.

429
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:08,430
The deputy director said that after the second trial,

430
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:11,690
he'll ensure that the sentencing trial will immediately follow.

431
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:14,170
Let's show our thanks after the trial.

432
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,180
You have something to say to me?

433
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:24,400
You were staring so intensely,

434
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:27,100
I thought it was because I'm handsome.

435
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:32,130
Hyungnim, thanks for your hard work.

436
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,100
Everyone, go on with your business.

437
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,200
You stay.

438
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,900
I have something to say to Attorney Eulji.

439
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,900
- Hello.
- Dr. Ki.

440
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,400
- Yes.
- It's been a while, Dr. Ki.

441

What will happen to Jang Hwa Sa?

442
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,340
Will they order a stay of execution?

443
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,040
The reason why I'm meeting with Jang Hwa Sa is

444
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,620
to stop the appeals trial.

445
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,960
Although the order of execution may be difficult,

446
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,740
I'll make sure she lives...

447
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,290
the rest of her life on death row.

448
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,960
Looks like you don't know yet.

449
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:38,100
Pardon me, but what do you mean?

450
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,200
Jang Hwa Sa has...

451
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:47,000
stage four pancreatic cancer.

452
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,300
She has three months to live at most.

453
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,680
I hope she won't be released on a stay of execution.

454
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,860
As you said, I want her to

455

456
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,700
She's a dying woman.

457
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,190
She'll die regardless.

458
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,900
Must she finish out her life in prison?

459
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,500
This is unexpected.

460
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,800
Have you grown to like her?

461
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,820
I was hoping you'd take on Jang Hwa Sa after Chan Sung's case.

462
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:29,660
You don't want to?

463
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,510
No.

464
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,700
I should do it.

465
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:11,100
Why didn't you tell me it was pancreatic cancer?

466
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,100
If I did...

467
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,270
would anything change?

468
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,610
So you can shed tears for Hae Yi?

469

471
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:35,640

00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,720
How can you pretend to be Hae Yi like that?

473
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,800
How?

474
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,400
How could you...

475
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,500
look at me while pretending to be Hae Yi?

476
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,600

487
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,000
My goodness, Unnie, what's wrong?

488
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,300
Get up. Let's go inside.

489
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:23,400

00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,700
mean that?

495
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:44,080
I lived as a death row inmate...

496
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,540
for 34 years.

497
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,300
Every day.

498
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,210
Every single day...

499
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,400
I had to be conscious of death,

500
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:01,100
face death,

501
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:05,100
and live with death.

502
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,500
Would I kill someone in order to...

503
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,400
cling onto life?

504
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,600
I won't beg...

505
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,700
for life in that manner.

506
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,200
Change back.

507
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:28,800
I found a way to switch your bodies back.

508
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,100

511
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,260
I was debating whether to wake you or not.

512
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:07,650
What happened last night?

513
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,800
Something bad happened, right?

514
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:13,680
I spoke to Ddaeng Chil early this morning.

515
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:18,400
I asked her for security cam clips of Morgan Kim at Ki San's house.

516
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,400
Where are you going? To work?

517
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:23,790
Like that?

518
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:27,620
I have to go somewhere. Don't come with me.

519
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,750
Where are you going?

520
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,270
Unnie, you're going somewhere without me?

521
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,400
Are you going to Grandma?

522
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,030
Pal Pal.

523
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,300
You suffered because of me.

524

<i>Just until then, Hae Yi.</i>

528
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,700
<i>Please give me time.</i>

529
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,200
Hae Yi.

530
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:47,900
What are you doing here so early?

531
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,800
I was just running...

532
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,160
and ended up here.

533
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,700
C'mon.

534
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:56,820
You came here because you missed me.

535
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,740
To talk about Director Ma Hyun Cheol?

536
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:02,800
I don't want to talk about Director Ma today.

537
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,000
I just want to run.

538
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:09,190
Fast and with excitement.

539
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:12,190
With fun and joy.

540
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,800
I want to run fast.

541
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
Hold on with both hands!

542
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,120
You'll fly off like that!

543
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:43,000
You ditched work to come here for fresh air?

544
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,460
What's wrong with this place?

545
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,960
Wait here.

546
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,280
What's going on?

547
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:53,820
Oh, my heart.

548
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,700
Is my heart fluttering?

549
00:41:57,730 --> 00:41:59,920
My heart's beating fast.

550
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,300
Geez.

551
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,360
Mal Boon...

552
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,460
really loves meat.

553
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,000
Mal Boon, we have the same appetite.

554
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,100
You're confusing me.

555
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:19,120
You looking after your client's mother.

556
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,920
Which one's the real Eulji Hae Yi?

557
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,970
Let's not talk about that today.

558
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:27,100
Aigoo, you're feeding me like my grandma.

559
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,830
You probably ate lettuce every day dieting.

560
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:32,400
Today, unbuckle your belt and

561
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,500
feast until your stomach bursts.

562
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,940
The one who inhales smog every day should eat it.

563
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:39,790
Nah. A real man eats the wing.

564
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:42,260
The wing. The greasy part.

565
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,160
And I'm not in traffic dept. anymore.

566
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,100
I transferred to homicide department.

567
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,500
What about Mal Boon? I want this, too.

568
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:54,380
Oh, no! Wait a sec.

569
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,970
Aigoo, isn't it hot?

570
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,500
You must be uncomfortable because it's wet.

571
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:09,600
My mom's such a tidy person.

572
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:11,500
Ma'am...

573
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:14,550
Mal Boon needs to go pee.

574
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,060
Miss Mal Boon...

575
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,700
wait here.

576
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:21,200
It's occupied.

577
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:25,500
Let's go.

578
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,900
Hwa Sa!

579
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,800
Hwa Sa!

580
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,100
I can't eat this alone.

581
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,100
Pardon me.

582
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,200
I'm looking for someone.

583
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:23,600
Grandma?

584
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
What's wrong?

585
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:29,810
Where did Attorney Eulji go?

586
00:44:29,810 --> 00:44:31,610
Hwa Sa.

587
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:33,480
Hwa Sa.

588
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,300
It's Ma.

589
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:42,920
- It's that punk, Ma.
- Ma?

590
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,100
Who's Ma?

591
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,650
- Ma Hyun Cheol?
- Yeah.

592
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:51,120
You're right. It's that punk, Ma Hyun Cheol.

593
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:54,440
Sir, please help me.

594
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,330
That punk Ma is

595
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,140
trying to kill my daughter,

596
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,270
so he took her.

597
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,300
Geez.

598
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,590
That jerk raised the price at the last minute.

599
00:45:51,590 --> 00:45:53,740
I'm the master of negotiation,

600
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:55,900
so I only gave him 20% more.

601
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:58,100
Aigoo, I had a hard time.

602
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:01,610
What?

603
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:02,860
This isn't it?

604
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,700
It's from Cheong Won prison. I double checked.

605
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:06,900
It's the right one.

606
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,790
Geez, you scared me.

607
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:14,280
You said your life depends on it,

608
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,800
but you seem so uneasy.

609
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,000
You're right.

610
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,600
A life depends on it.

611
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:47,300
Team Leader!

612
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:49,800
Team Leader.

613
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,230
I can't give you half, you want something else?

614
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,850
- Team leader.
- I can't give you half either.

615
00:46:55,850 --> 00:46:58,910
What I'm saying is, she's gone.

616
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,800
- What?
- She disappeared.

617
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:23,800
Hello?

618
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,900
You send me a text that you're going out.

619
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:37,100
You're out all day, come back, and say what?

620
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,800
- A Damjang attorney's kidnapped?
- I'm serious!

621
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:42,320
We were eating chicken soup, then she was gone.

622
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,560
Chicken soup?

623
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,800
You investigate while eating chicken with the suspect?

624
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,530
The place is Cheoingu Sokchon.

625
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:53,090
Please ask the Cheoingu police department for security cam footage.

626
00:47:53,090 --> 00:47:56,670
- That's Yongin precinct.
- But someone might die!

627
00:47:56,670 --> 00:47:59,560
- She fled because she didn't want to eat with you.
- Hyungnim!

628
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:02,600
How many times must I say it? This is serious!

629
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:06,400
Do you like that girl?

630
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,700
For Pete's sake.

631
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,400
She got you suspended and got Tae Soo fired.

632
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,520
You said she's a murder suspect!

633
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:19,370
Ma Hyun Cheol's dog was stabbed to death.

634
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:22,650
Killing a dog is harder than killing a person

635
00:48:22,650 --> 00:48:26,720
If Eulji Hae Yi did it, then she's not an attorney.

636
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,050
She's a professional killer.

637
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:32,200
Ma Hyun Cheol's foe could've kidnapped her.

638
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,800
- Bye. See you in the morning.
- Okay.

639
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:42,360
- Goodbye.
- Hello.

640
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,800
Are you setting up house here?

641
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:11,800
<i>It's pancreatic cancer.</i>

642
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,700
<i>I won't let you go alone.</i>

643
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,000
Director Park?

644
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:37,700
I must see Jang Hwa Sa today.

645
00:49:37,730 --> 00:49:40,070
She has two to three months left.

646
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:42,400
It'll be hard to see her once she goes back to prison.

647
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,800
But Jang Hwa Sa shouldn't see me.

648
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,800
While she's sleeping.

649
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:01,000
What about Jang Hwa Sa?

650
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,900
Hae Yi, I should've listened to you.

651
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,300
Did she run away? Where? Abroad?

652
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,300
It's not abroad. There's no departure record.

653
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:20,700
Don't be so pessimistic.

654
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:23,300
Medical treatments are good these days. 
<i>[ 23 hours before the incident ]</i>

655
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,400
If you're ready, shall we go?

656
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,410
Well...

657
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,870
Can I bid farewell to

658
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:37,480
inmate 822?

659
00:50:37,500 --> 00:50:40,800
The car will be leaving soon.

660
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,800
This may be my last farewell, that's why.

661
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:51,200
Please do me this favor.

662
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,100
Unnie, I feel so bad for you.

663
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:00,700
Unnie.

664
00:51:00,750 --> 00:51:04,100
Stop making a scene. There's no time to cry.

665
00:51:04,100 --> 00:51:08,580
Unnie, how can I not when we're parting ways?

666
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:10,710
You said your husband...

667
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:13,710
runs an errand service for inmates, right?

668
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:16,410
Getting them cigarettes,

669
00:51:16,410 --> 00:51:18,640
burners phones, and

670
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:21,010
uses networks to run outside errands.

671
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:23,250
It's "My friend dot com."

672
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:25,700
"An inmates's best friend corporation".

673
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:29,880
After I couldn't sell diet pills, we started a family business.

674
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,340
Listen carefully to me.

675
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,400
You must do as I say.

676
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,290
You can't make a mistake. Can you do that?

677
00:51:39,290 --> 00:51:41,910
Just give me your order.

678
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:45,130
I can run errands for my dying Unnie.

679
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,760
I'll go park the car.

680
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:18,600
How will you open it?

681
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:23,100
Ta-da.

682
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:28,000
Sorry.

683
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,160
I got a misdemeanor for doing this.

684
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,030
You're fast as a lightening. Good girl.

685
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:50,900
Youou think it'll be there?

686
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:54,450
It's from last year, September. Isn't it reset after two weeks?

687
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:58,260
It's 128 gigabytes. I may be able to restore it.

688
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,730
Oh! This.

689
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:05,260
Unnie.

690
00:53:05,260 --> 00:53:07,760
Unnie!

691
00:53:09,550 --> 00:53:13,720
- Inmate 888.
- Inmate 888, Lee Hye Ja!

692
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:19,800
- You b****.
- We found it.

693
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:23,400
I said, we found it.

694
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,660
Oh!

695
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:36,110
Thank you.

696
00:53:36,110 --> 00:53:39,590
Unnie, we found it!

697
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:42,000
Attorney, we found it.

698
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,300
I said we found it. The game's over now.

699
00:53:44,330 --> 00:53:47,970
We found a clip of Ki Chan Sung kissing Morgan Kim.

700
00:54:15,770 --> 00:54:17,840
<i>We're arriving in one hour.</i>

701
00:54:17,840 --> 00:54:19,640
<i>Make sure everything's set.</i>

702
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,900
<i>I'll let the visitor out</i>

703
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,300
<i>and complete the mission.</i>

704
00:54:57,900 --> 00:55:00,100
Hello!

705
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,160
Hello?

706
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:22,470
Must be the nurse's office. Do I have an exam tomorrow?

707
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,600
What are you doing?

708
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:41,100
Leave already.

709
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:43,740
It's against policy to be here this late.

710
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,880
Let me get my insulin shot.

711
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,300
Let me go!

712
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,900
Let go of me!

713
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,400
The phone rang, which means Jang Hwa Sa's here.

714
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,700
- What do you mean?
- There's no time to explain.

715
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:52,900
Hurry and go down the emergency stairwell.

716
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,700
Do whatever it takes to lose officer Choi

717
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,040
and bring Jang Hwa Sa to this room.

718
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:43,300
<i>I didn't want to return this body because</i>

719
00:57:43,340 --> 00:57:47,530
<i>I felt bad for my mother.</i>

720
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:53,470
<i>But that wasn't the truth.</i>

721
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:58,240
<i>What happened next was due to my rage toward Ki San.</i>

722
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,830
<i>That I must get revenge</i>
