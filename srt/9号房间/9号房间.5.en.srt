00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:01,720
<i>Anyway, there was a power outage.</i>

172
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:06,120
<i>So a pregnant lady died during surgery, <br>and babies in the incubator died.</i>

173
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,560
The director killed <br>himself out of guilt.

174
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,040
Ten minutes before <br>your next patient.

175
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:27,590
Doctor, did you have <br>sleep paralysis?

176
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,360
No, had an absurd dream.

177
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,030
Let's get ready.

178
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,960
They say absurd dreams <br>will make you taller.

179
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,130
No thank you.

180
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:47,060
[ Rain Sleep Hospital ]

181
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,870
What am I doing?

182
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,660
A few years later, another doctor <br>took it over and re-opened.

183
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,620
That's when I was hired.

184
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:03,690
The director felt iffy and <br>donated everything here.

185
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:07,870
Based on your story, <br>it's quite a history.

186
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,660
Farewell.

187
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,760
- Geez. <br> - Unlucky piece of crap.

188
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,110
Officer's here.

189
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:15,830
What are you doing?

190
00:15:15,830 --> 00:15:18,860
- Hurry up and work! <br> <i>- Yes, ma'am!</i>

191
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:21,430
Inmate 122.

192
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,280
You have a visitor.

193
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,160
Really?

194
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,010
Ow. Damn this body.

195
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,960
Pal Pal!

196
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,770
We almost died.

197
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,100
No way, that's nonsense.

198
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,810
I know you got our fax.

199
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:21,090
She is Big Unni's <br>appeal attorney.

200
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:23,510
She's seeing another <br>attorney right now!

201
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,910
Wait. Why do you <br>talk down to me?

202
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,760
I'm a normal citizen now.

203
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,190
Oh, that's right.

204
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,880
Aigoo, my apologies. <br>I've known you for so long.

205
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,720
I feel like we're family.

206
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,140
Fill out the application for <br>an afternoon visit,

207
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,190
and wait in the waiting room.

208
00:16:42,190 --> 00:16:44,550
Who's she meeting right now?

209
00:16:44,550 --> 00:16:46,550
Attorney Ma Hyun Cheol.

210
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,150
Who?

211
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:53,990
Damjang Director Ma Hyun Cheol.

212
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:55,720
What are you doing?

213
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,170
You didn't report to correctional services <br>that Jang Hwa Sa tried to escape, right?

214
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,170
Unni!

215
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,840
Unn...

216
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,310
Oh, Director!

217
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,460
You're here sooner than I thought.

218
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,820
Aigoo, Jang Hwa Sa.

219
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,970
Your great beauty <br>sure has dwindled.

220
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,900
Cut the bull****.

221
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,800
You came because you believe <br>that I'm Eulji Hae Yi, right?

222
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:36,150
Geez.

223
00:17:36,150 --> 00:17:39,730
I'd be mad to believe it, <br>but it's unsettling not to.

224
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,730
I'll give you one minute.

225
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,530
Prove that you're Eulji Hae Yi.

226
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:55,510
Attorney! Attorney!

227
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:58,920
05422207189718.

228
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,590
Not impressed.

229
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:11,720
Six junior and senior partners <br>share that account.

230
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,490
Our company was founded on...

231
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,350
June 15th.

232
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,980
Are you kidding me?

233
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,880
This is worthless.

234
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,700
I came to Cheong Won for nothing.

235
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:25,520
I'll have chili pepper <br>dumplings then leave.

236
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,090
Busan Junghwa All-Girls High School.

237
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:46,340
My God!

238
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,460
It's the trench coat man!

239
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,640
Director?

240
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,650
Hello, Mickey Mouse.

241
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,190
Who?

242
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:19,560
Who else knows about this?

243
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,880
No one else knows.

244
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,820
I'm the only one who saw it.

245
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:33,940
But...

246
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,880
shouldn't I know this info <br>to make senior partner?

247
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:40,080
You have a unique hobby.

248
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,890
It is you...

249
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,870
Attorney Eul.

250
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,270
Eulji Hae Yi.

251
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,970
I'm seeing you with my eyes...

252
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:57,210
but this, this, this is...

253
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,990
I can't believe this.

254
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,660
Don't you want a different life?

255
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:06,250
Your wife divorced you because <br>you lacked sexual prowess, right?

256
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:09,080
You're hanging on <br>thanks to medication.

257
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:13,210
But your tiny heart's <br>coated with cholesterol...

258
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:16,110
and you don't know when it'll stop.

259
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,980
If you despise your body, get rid of it.

260
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,940
Don't make things difficult.

261
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,830
How's it different from <br>an organ transplant?

262
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:27,010
You're buying a <br>young and healthy body.

263
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,820
Is that...

264
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,350
possible?

265
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,510
- You don't believe it after seeing me?<br>- I do!

266
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:38,090
I believe you. I must believe you.

267
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,190
If I help you...

268
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:43,010
you can become like <br>Jang Hwa Sa, too.

269
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:47,680
If you want a rebirth as <br>a healthy, sexy guy, then...

270
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,970
set up a terms reduction meeting.

271
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:56,070
A month is enough for a terms reduction <br>and to be released from prison, right?

272
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,620
Everything was spot on, but...

273
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,850
your diction was horrible.

274
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:18,890
Answer your phone when I call.

275
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:20,840
Of course.

276
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,300
I'm not your enemy.

277
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,100
and definitely not your opponent.

278
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,580
The circumstances...

279
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,230
just fell this this way.

280
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,340
Instead of a jerk like Ma Hyun Cheol,

281
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,070
shouldn't you team up with me?

282
00:21:43,070 --> 00:21:44,750
Team up with you?

283
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:52,210
I was on the stairway to heaven.

284
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:55,470
I was going to marry Yoo Jin...

285
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,280
and make senior partner, but...

286
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,420
you dragged me down.

287
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,920
I trust Ma Hyun Chul <br>100 times more than you.

288
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:13,000
I came to confirm if you were the <br>one who paid Lee Sang Hee.

289
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,520
But whenever we meet, <br>it always ends like this.

290
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:21,740
You touched my safe, didn't you?

291
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:27,050
Ma Hyun Cheol has the <br>power to get me out.

292
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:29,090
This means that...

293
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:32,580
your fake life is over.

294
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:36,490
Ma Hyun Cheol believes <br>that I'm Eulji Hae Yi.

295
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,890
What could you do about it?

296
00:22:40,550 --> 00:22:42,120
Well...

297
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:45,660
Just what should I do?

298
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,970
<i>Cut the bull****.</i>

299
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,890
<i>You're here because you believe <br>that I'm Eulji Hae Yi, right?</i>

300
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,040
It's Ma Hyun Cheol.

301
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,360
CEO...

302
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:20,880
Even after your surgery, <br>still feels uneasy, right?

303
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,970
Director Ma.

304
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:27,590
did you block my number?

305
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:30,100
How long will you avoid me?

306
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,030
You're in Hyeseungpo, right?

307
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:35,280
I''ll be attending Father's <br>photo exhibition.

308
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,810
I'll see you there.

309
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,010
Hyeseungpo.

310
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:42,490
His secretary said he'll be at <br>San Hae Resort's opening ceremony.

311
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:45,240
He's selling me out to <br>Chu Young Bae.

312
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,480
With what?

313
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,350
What do we lure in Ma Hyun Cheol?

314
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:53,570
I didn't come this far to be <br>taken out by Ma Hyun Cheol.

315
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,380
It's me, Pal Pal. I need <br>info on someone.

316
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,830
Ma Hyun Cheol, <br>Damjang Lawfirm's Director.

317
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,080
And one more person.

318
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,010
The Attorney I was with yesterday.

319
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:08,430
Okay.

320
00:24:08,430 --> 00:24:11,550
I'm not asking for money for <br>helping Big Unni, but...

321
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,150
do we get any money out of this?

322
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,840
Okay.

323
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,410
Kik Min, stop and get over here.

324
00:24:18,410 --> 00:24:20,020
We have money coming.

325
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,250
Whoa, look at this. Wow!

326
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,230
Director Park, get <br>me the fishing net!

327
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:35,350
Wow, I can tell this sucker <br>is 50 centimeters.

328
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,560
Bravo!

329
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,250
Bravo!

330
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,040
CEO, I must tell you something.

331
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,650
Ain't life easy?

332
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,960
Catch it, eat it, catch it, <br>eat it, s*** it.

333
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,310
President Ma.

334
00:24:48,310 --> 00:24:52,250
have you tried fresh <br>sashimi on a boat?

335
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,970
Unni!

336
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,560
Attorney! Attorney.

337
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,010
We're screwed.

338
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:01,500
They went out fishing.

339
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,640
- Let's book a boat first.<br>- No.

340
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:06,570
He'll tell Ki San everything <br>before we get there.

341
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,740
Then what do you think will happen? <br>This is the ocean.

342
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:12,870
People can be thrown in the ocean <br>and it'll be labeled as "accidents."

343
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:17,860
It's like swimming into the <br>jaws of a shark to be eaten.

344
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,630
It's very chewy.

345
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:29,480
Like eating rice cake.

346
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:36,910
You're a defender, not a striker...

347
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,840
but why did you fake being a striker?

348
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:46,030
To start a siblings fight and <br>then eat up Damjang?

349
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:51,090
Is that why you leaked info about <br>Jang Hwa Sa to Yoo Jin?

350
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:59,240
When did you find out...

351
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:03,690
that I'm Chu Young Bae?

352
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,080
The 911...

353
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,100
rescue captain's tape recording.

354
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,970
CEO, that's not important right now.

355
00:26:15,970 --> 00:26:18,400
Listen to this about Jang Hwa Sa first.

356
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,290
You'll be saying, <br>"Attaboy, Ma Hyun Cheol!"

357
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:24,800
"I should repay you with Damjang."

358
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,490
That's how you'll feel.

359
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:35,170
<i>Cut the bull****.</i>

360
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:38,390
<i>You're here because you believe <br>that I'm Eulji Hae Yi, right?</i>

361
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:41,580
<i>I'd be mad to believe it, <br>but it's unsettling not to.</i>

362
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,660
CEO, why?

363
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:51,890
Was just getting started.

364
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,430
Don't you know that <br>Jang Hwa Sa is mentally ill?

365
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:06,650
[DID-Dissassociative identity disorder ]<br> I know she was diagnosed with DID.

366
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:09,030
But I'm positive she's Eulji Hae Yi.

367
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,050
You'll agree if you <br>watch this till the end.

368
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,720
Ma Hyun Cheol.

369
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:18,600
Do you know what your crime is?

370
00:27:20,050 --> 00:27:23,580
Telling Dr. Ki about Jang Hwa Sa?

371
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,840
Making me trust you.

372
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,000
Making me believe that <br>you're on my side.

373
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,470
Making me believe that <br>you're trustworthy.

374
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:39,490
But when I put my guard down due to that trust,

375
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:43,430
you were ready to <br>stab me in the back!

376
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,130
CEO, CEO...

377
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,570
CEO...

378
00:27:58,570 --> 00:28:01,960
I took a lowly attorney who <br>couldn't afford a pork rib dinner...

379
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,240
and made you into the <br>best in our country! Didn't I?

380
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,560
But how dare you...

381
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,940
stab me in the back?

382
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:21,850
This is where the CEO fishes a lot.

383
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,690
Geez, so frustrating.

384
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,650
Unni.

385
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,930
Unni!

386
00:28:38,610 --> 00:28:40,620
CEO, CEO.

387
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,570
Mr. Ma...

388
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:49,280
Your torso's like a tree stump.

389
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,210
Baekdu Dynasty.

390
00:29:12,350 --> 00:29:14,230
CEO.

391
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:16,630
She's Jang Hwa Sa!

392
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:22,660
She's not Eulji Hae Yi, but <br>Jang Hwa Sa. Jang Hwa Sa!

393
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,200
I know it's hard to believe...

394
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,720
but in this world...

395
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:31,830
aren't there mysteries which <br>can't be explained with logic?

396
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,300
Director, what's wrong with you?

397
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:42,400
Jang Hwa Sa spent 34 years with <br>immoral swindlers and criminals.

398
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,950
It's easy for her to deceive you.

399
00:29:44,950 --> 00:29:46,900
Come to your senses.

400
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:55,600
So Ma Hyun Cheol was <br>fooled by Jang Hwa Sa...

401
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,130
that's why you came <br>all the way here?

402
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,500
Huh?

403
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,640
Chu Young Bae.

404
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:53,510
<i>Chu Young Bae!</i>

405
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,490
Why did you do that to me?

406
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:07,780
<i>Which bastard is this?</i>

407
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,240
I asked why you called <br>me Chu Young Bae.

408
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:19,680
It was President Ma's orders.

409
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:26,310
Since I'm handling your son's case, an opportunity will arise.

410
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:31,810
He told me to make sure you hear the name Chu Young Bae.

411
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:40,840
Must I believe what you say?

412
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:48,440
Are you planning to exchange this useless suspicion with Ki Chan Sung's trial?

413
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:59,050
Lee Sang Hee. The accident investigator.

414
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:02,420
The person who did a big part in getting your son acquitted.

415
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,490
Of course, I was the conductor.

416
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:06,770
So?

417
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:09,420
Society has changed.

418
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:13,660
Improper solicitation and grafts are done for.

419
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:16,650
The only person who can do this...

420
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,170
is me.

421
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:22,350
Besides me...

422
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:25,050
no one can win this trial.

423
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,300
What's taking so long?

424
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,650
Is he taking a sh** that's been inside of him for three years?

425
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,340
It doesn't taste good when the noodles are soggy.

426
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,750
That punk!

427
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,660
Hey!

428
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,220
Stop! Why aren't you stopping?

429
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,120
Stop right there!

430
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,320
Hey!

431
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,990
Hurry up. Aren't you leaving?

432
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,070
This bus leaves at the exact time.

433
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,240
Geez.

434
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,010
What the?

435
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:41,060
Attorney?

436
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:43,640
I'm getting in.

437
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,620
Let's get going.

438
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,700
I've been kidnapped.

439
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:49,460
- Kidnapped?<br>- Yes. Hurry up, let's go.

440
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,380
Hurry!

441
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,860
Let's hurry up and leave!

442
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,240
- Hey!<br>- Ah!

443
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,240
Get out.

444
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,840
- He's the kidnapper.<br>- Get out!

445
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,900
Just run him over.

446
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,010
Why aren't you getting out?

447
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,450
That crazy imbecile.

448
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:01,020
Get out!

449
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,980
Why didn't you just hit me with the car?

450
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,420
He says he was kidnapped.

451
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:11,450
Kidnapped? My goodness.

452
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:15,090
Bang Sang Soo, you're under arrest for hiding and helping a witness to flee.

453
00:34:15,090 --> 00:34:17,010
What are you doing?

454
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,230
He's just a traffic police officer.

455
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,940
Help me.

456
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,070
You have the right to remain silent and can hire an attorney.

457
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:28,520
If you want to defend yourself, you can do so. Let's go.

458
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,690
Excuse me.

459
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,360
Tell me what's going on.

460
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:37,240
Attorney Bang asked for help and said he's been kidnapped.

461
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:39,140
I need to hear why.

462
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,340
Or...

463
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:43,500
I can report it to the police?

464
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:46,280
This is nuts.

465
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,750
So?

466
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:52,380
You couldn't even subpoena the witness?

467
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:55,060
He's on sick leave at the NFS and he's not at home.

468
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,950
I can only be on a stakeout for so many days. It's driving me crazy.

469
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,370
It's driving me even more crazy.

470
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,530
Let's go.

471
00:35:11,970 --> 00:35:15,150
I'm not sure if we can do this. We didn't get permission to do this.

472
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,940
Look at those Damjang fools.

473
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:20,850
Why are they at the house of the Prosecutor's witness?

474
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,130
Those dirty fools.

475
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,920
Hwan Hee, there isn't much time left until my review.

476
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:30,460
Attorney Eul said that I don't have a likable or respectable face.

477
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:32,280
This is quite a personal topic.

478
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,120
If I do well on the Ki Chan Sung case, I'll become a full-time employee.

479
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,570
I'm going to give Lee Sang Hee a copy of the questions the prosecutor might ask.

480
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,970
And ask him to practice with me just once.

481
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:44,030
If you become a full-time employee, don't boss my team around.

482
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,210
Hey!

483
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,980
What are you doing here?

484
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,390
How are you here?

485
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:53,440
The couple went on a vacation. Where was it again?

486
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,760
- Cebu?<br>- The Philippines?

487
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,710
You didn't put him on the travel ban list?

488
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,600
It's not something I can just put him on.

489
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,510
The Deputy Manager didn't approve it.

490
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:05,280
You should have figured out a way.

491
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,660
- Have a nice day.<br>- Okay.

492
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:10,470
Hyungnim, let's talk later.

493
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:13,200
I'm at Lee Sang Hee's house with Prosecutor Ji

494
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,880
but he avoided the subpoena and went on a vacation to Cebu.

495
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,610
Sang Hee hyungnim died.

496
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,380
That's why I'm calling.

497
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,150
He's dead?

498
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:26,530
<i>He took his shoes off and jumped from the hotel balcony.</i>

499
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,080
How do you know this, hyungnim?

500
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,500
His wife just called and I called you right away.

501
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,620
She came back after getting a massage and this happened.

502
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:36,860
She doesn't speak English or know the procedure.

503
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:40,720
<i>She was crying and asking me to speak to the local police.</i>

504
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,090
This is insane.

505
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,590
I'm shocked as well.

506
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:50,070
Would I have gone to his house if I knew he went on a vacation?

507
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:51,850
Would I have gone there if I knew he committed suicide?

508
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,830
Suicide my a**!

509
00:36:53,830 --> 00:36:55,970
Then? Did I kill him?

510
00:36:55,970 --> 00:37:00,290
Faulty brake hose, innocent, witness subpoena, departure, suicide.

511
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,750
Everything was planned nicely.

512
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,540
Although you may not have written the script yourself,

513
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,770
you at least poked it with your chopstick to see if it was cooked.

514
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:08,770
What are you talking about? This isn't a baked sweet potato.

515
00:37:08,770 --> 00:37:11,740
- What did I poke?<br>If it wasn't you, it must be Eulji Hae Yi.

516
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,890
Why? Do you feel victimized?

517
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:17,430
Then shut up and take me to her.

518
00:37:17,430 --> 00:37:18,870
Okay?

519
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,190
That's how it went.

520
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:28,940
Ah, I've seen you at Chan Sung's trial.

521
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,730
Chan Sung?

522
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,950
Ki Chan Sung?

523
00:37:32,950 --> 00:37:35,450
This is Mr. Ki.

524
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:38,370
CEO Ki San's younger brother and a doctor at San Hae Group's hospital.

525
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:40,500
He's also Attorney Eulji's boyfriend.

526
00:37:41,830 --> 00:37:43,440
I'm Ki Yoo Jin.

527
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,530
Why would I exchange greetings with the suspects family?

528
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:49,630
Forget it.

529
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,080
My goal right now

530
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:55,540
is to send Chan Sung to jail for murder.

531
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,820
Let's go.

532
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,730
- Mr. Ki.<br>- Hurry up and come.

533
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,880
Mr. Ki.

534
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,560
Mr. Ki.

535
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,660
Attorney Eul's boyfriend.

536
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,830
Birds of a feather flock together.

537
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,490
How nice.

538
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:22,820
So nice. Very good.

539
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,030
<i>It's not that I want to go with you. But I could be of some help.</i>

540
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:46,670
<i>Tomorrow also happens to be my day off, so I can go with you if you'd like.</i>

541
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:05,540
Oh, my God!

542
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,470
Goodness, gracious.

543
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:09,850
Daebak.

544
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:13,190
Ddaengchil has got some skills.

545
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,920
What is your business here?

546
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,560
I'm here to make a delivery.

547
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,440
Outside food is not allowed.

548
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,130
This was ordered from the East Sea room on the ninth floor.

549
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,660
Outside food isn't allowed here, so take it back.

550
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,090
What do you mean take it back? The customer ordered it.

551
00:39:31,090 --> 00:39:32,050
What's going on?

552
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,710
He said the guest at the East Sea room ordered this.

553
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:40,090
Properly set it and take it to him.

554
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,460
Okay.

555
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:05,320
No.

556
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:08,030
Pal Pal!

557
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,510
Unni.

558
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,450
Power or money.

559
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,660
Money or sex appeal.

560
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,140
If not that, how are you going to persuade a guy? Do you know of another way?

561
00:40:24,090 --> 00:40:25,580
<i>How far are you prepared to go?</i>

562
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,000
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

563
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,350
<i>I'm curious as well.</i>

564
00:40:30,350 --> 00:40:34,760
<i>How far the end of my road is.</i>

565
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:02,450
I have erectile dysfunction from being a severe diabetic.

566
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:04,700
A married couple

567
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,990
doesn't stay together because of their bodies, but because of their attachment.

568
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,900
I'm divorced.

569
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,310
Not that.

570
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:16,020
The cards in your hand...

571
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,350
if you have something else...

572
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,290
come inside.

573
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,880
Don't you want to make a deal?

574
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,840
What about it?

575
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,810
I'll just be embarrassed in front of the entire nation.

576
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:57,080
My life is on the line here.

577
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,780
Disgrace.

578
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:02,820
It's nothing.

579
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:08,050
Why did Ki San try to kill you?

580
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:10,030
Chu Young Bae.

581
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,270
That's the reason.

582
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,110
What else would it be?

583
00:42:14,110 --> 00:42:17,450
Let's say Chu Young Bae believes that I'm Jang Hwa Sa...

584
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:20,930
he's already found out my identity. Do you think he'll keep you alive?

585
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,740
Do you think so?

586
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,710
If my Jang Hwa Sa card doesn't work...

587
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,730
I'll have to live abroad in hiding.

588
00:42:30,730 --> 00:42:34,190
We live in a world where you can kill someone for a hundred dollars.

589
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:39,990
You...

590
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:44,040
Do you have a way...

591
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,140
to protect me from Ki San?

592
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:50,020
There's only one way for you to live.

593
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:54,460
Team up with me and reveal that Ki San is Chu Young Bae.

594
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:57,410
We have to reveal it soon.

595
00:43:03,370 --> 00:43:04,680
[ President Ma ]

596
00:43:06,630 --> 00:43:07,920
It's Ki Yoo Jin.

597
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,610
You're coming to Hyeseungpo?

598
00:43:09,610 --> 00:43:12,270
I have to meet you.

599
00:43:12,270 --> 00:43:13,860
Okay.

600
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:16,220
I'll tell you who your mother is

601
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:19,440
and what connection you have with Jang Hwa Sa.

602
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,310
I'll tell you everything. Hurry and come.

603
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:29,680
Why are you calling Ki Yoo Jin over?

604
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,840
Because he's Ki San's Achilles' heel.

605
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,870
Achilles' heel?

606
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,960
Ki Yoo Jin is?

607
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:56,170
Who's Ki Yoo Jin's birth mother?

608
00:43:56,170 --> 00:44:00,030
Is he even Ki Se Woong's real son?

609
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,530
When Dr. Ki gets here

610
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:05,540
you'll find out about everything.

611
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:09,840
So be patient.

612
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,340
Try this.

613
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,700
This is the best taste in the world.

614
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,040
The best taste in the world...

615
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,340
is this.

616
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:53,120
Pufferfish eggs fermented for five years.

617
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:57,050
Electrifying.

618
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:06,390
The reason you became my public defender,

619
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,940
Is it the orders of Chu Young Bae?

620
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,770
[ January 4th 1985 ]

621
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:20,030
You eat ten servings and don't have money when you're a lawyer?

622
00:45:20,030 --> 00:45:22,230
Five servings...

623
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,740
and three bottles of soju.

624
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:27,450
Aigo.

625
00:45:27,450 --> 00:45:30,300
I can buy this for 3,000 won in Hakdong.

626
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,410
Stop bulls***ing and pay your tab!

627
00:45:33,410 --> 00:45:35,050
I'll pay for it.

628
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:43,910
Get Jang Hwa Sa the longest sentence allowed by law.

629
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:45,390
The death penalty.

630
00:45:47,290 --> 00:45:49,040
Oh.

631
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,370
I think you've come to the wrong person.

632
00:45:51,370 --> 00:45:53,390
I'm an attorney, not a prosecutor.

633
00:45:53,390 --> 00:45:56,840
You can request to be her public defender.

634
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:59,240
Who are you?

635
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:05,210
I'm Ki San.

636
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,060
Chu Young Bae.

637
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:11,410
He's my younger brother.

638
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:13,000
Illegitimate half-brother.

639
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:19,920
Chu Young Bae bought you one meal...

640
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,340
and ordered to have me killed?

641
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,610
That's right.

642
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,560
Okay...

643
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,010
Fine.

644
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,570
Let me ask one last thing?

645
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:38,240
The one who tried to kill my mother...

646
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,840
is it Chu Young Bae?

647
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,080
No, no.

648
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,030
It's not the CEO.

649
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:53,830
You can't. This is the evidence that will prove Hwa Sa's innocence.

650
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:56,350
I said give it to me, Grandma!

651
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,570
That Grandma...

652
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:06,620
Brought some tape...

653
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,640
as evidence.

654
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,870
The 911 call tape recording.

655
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:14,500
So I had no choice.

656
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:18,850
Whack!

657
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:26,170
You...

658
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:30,710
did this...

659
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:34,690
to my mother?

660
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:49,280
Hello.

661
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,730
Can you tell me Presiden Ma Hyun Cheol's room number?

662
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:55,200
President Ma Hyun Cheol?

663
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:56,690
Uncle!

664
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,020
Hyungnim.

665
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:02,530
I ate hagfish with Chan Sung.

666
00:48:02,530 --> 00:48:04,860
It would've been nice if we could have eaten together.

667
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,140
Meet with President Ma later. Let's go to Father's exhibition first.

668
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:10,490
Okay.

669
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,270
Let's go.

670
00:48:40,610 --> 00:48:42,940
President Ma's dog...

671
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,610
did you kill him?

672
00:48:45,610 --> 00:48:47,520
Is that important?

673
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:49,840
The reason why is important.

674
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:52,530
Why you had to openly

675
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:55,600
threaten President Ma.

676
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:59,170
This man right here

677
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,300
was very stubborn.

678
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,620
He was very generous to you

679
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:08,310
but hard on me.

680
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:11,270
Just because Father loved you

681
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:15,530
many people thought you had to be the group heir.

682
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:18,240
I thought I weeded everyone out.

683
00:49:19,520 --> 00:49:21,530
Who knew President Ma would do that?

684
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:25,460
When Father passed away because of you

685
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:29,110
I didn't ask you to take responsibility.

686
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:32,740
What are you trying to say?

687
00:49:32,740 --> 00:49:37,450
Father tried to give me the company and got on your bad side.

688
00:49:37,450 --> 00:49:42,090
When he was sick you sent him to an island that was pretty much uninhabited.

689
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,420
A doctor would come every two weeks.

690
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:47,180
The ahjumma helper would come every two weeks.

691
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:50,180
Groceries would come every two weeks.

692
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,840
Books.

693
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:55,380
While I endlessly waited for the boat,

694
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,290
I resented Father.

695
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,480
Why did I ask him to save me?

696
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:07,740
I just...

697
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:12,150
wanted to go to school.

698
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:16,760
When Father's liver failed

699
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,020
and his stomach was filled with fluid.

700
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:23,430
I got on my knees and begged of you.

701
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:26,260
I'll live the life you want me to.

702
00:50:28,070 --> 00:50:30,850
So please take Father to a hospital.

703
00:50:32,250 --> 00:50:37,030
You've kept your promise.

704
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,100
If you're my brother...

705
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:41,050
you must keep it.

706
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:45,570
Because Father reaped what he sowed.

707

I'm going upstairs, so you figure it out from here.

I'm unsure if you'll find a motel around here

There are no vacant rooms because of all the VIP clients attending the opening ceremony.

725
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:58,670
They also won't give a room to a lowly lawyer like me.
