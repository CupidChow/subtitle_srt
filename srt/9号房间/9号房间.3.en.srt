3
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,034
Your sandwich is ready.
That will be 3,000 won.

4
00:00:38,687 --> 00:00:40,517
Enjoy.

5
00:00:42,104 --> 00:00:43,736
Hold on.

6
00:00:46,949 --> 00:00:50,311
Your club sandwich is ready.
That will be 8,000 won.

7
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,400
Enjoy.

8
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:00,719
Wait!

9
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,716
What year are you?

10
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,885
- Second year.
- Class of 2006?

11
00:01:30,885 --> 00:01:32,499
Me too.

12
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:42,972
Oh, that second year.

13
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:46,959
Age is nothing but a number.

14
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,725
Hey, little boy.

15
00:01:48,725 --> 00:01:51,540
I will never go out
with a high school kid like you.

16
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,263
Don't even think about it.

17
00:01:53,263 --> 00:01:55,613
Go study for your college entrance exam.

18
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:13,403
<i>[September 2017]</i>
We have all the documents...

19
00:02:14,397 --> 00:02:17,548
Oh, Gi Chan Sung is here.

20
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,959
Wow, life is so unfair.

21
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,645
Look at him in that suit.

22
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:27,286
- And that handsome face.
- Who's the one next to him?

23
00:02:27,286 --> 00:02:29,673
Chairman Gi San's
beloved younger brother.

24
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:32,192
He's the heir of Sanae Hospital.

25
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:01,532
You came to return my umbrella?

26
00:03:01,532 --> 00:03:04,024
I don't date high school kids.

27
00:03:05,124 --> 00:03:06,685
But I do like younger men.

<i>[Episode 3]
No, we haven't left yet.</i>

30
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,081
It's a complete mess here.

31
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,094
Young Cheol.

32
00:03:37,094 --> 00:03:39,790
How can you send her to a mental asylum
without a specialist's diagnosis?

33
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:41,889
You don't think I'm good enough?

34
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:44,536
No, that's not what I mean.

35
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:48,962
If I decide that she may become
a danger to other inmates

36
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,603
we can move her with
only the warden's consent.

37
00:03:51,603 --> 00:03:55,101
And that electrical...
Never mind.

38
00:03:55,101 --> 00:03:57,357
What's your relation to Jang Hwa Sa?

39
00:03:57,357 --> 00:04:00,568
Who is she to you that
you're making this into a huge deal?

40
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:03,911
You jerk...

41
00:04:08,603 --> 00:04:13,699
If you lock me up inside a mental asylum,
you think you can really become me?

42
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:17,250
You think you can become Eulji Hae Yi,
and steal my career and status?

43
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:20,396
You think you can steal everything?

44
00:04:20,396 --> 00:04:24,373
I just need your body temporarily.
I'm not trying to become you.

45
00:04:26,488 --> 00:04:29,296
I'm sure you're about to
lose it with anger

46
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:31,069
but what can you do?

47
00:04:31,069 --> 00:04:33,700
Think of it as the heavens allowing me
to use your body temporarily.

48
00:04:34,466 --> 00:04:37,637
How can the heavens allow it
when I'm against it?

49
00:04:40,755 --> 00:04:44,776
Once you to go Gongju,
you'll never be able to get a retrial.

50
00:04:44,776 --> 00:04:49,368
Your boyfriend forced me to come here...

51
00:04:49,368 --> 00:04:51,801
but I've changed my mind.

52
00:04:52,668 --> 00:04:55,255
Go stay in Gongju.
That would be best.

53
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:57,002
You thief!

54
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:02,572
What are you planning?

55
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:05,442
You want to make me into madman,
shove me into an asylum

56
00:05:05,442 --> 00:05:08,183
so you can take over my body?

57
00:05:08,437 --> 00:05:10,861
Who would believe you?

58
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:15,224
No matter how much you shout that you're
Eulji Hae Yi, who will believe you?

59
00:05:26,471 --> 00:05:27,935
Come in.

60
00:05:35,899 --> 00:05:38,911
- Can we take her now?
- I have something to say before then.

61
00:05:40,072 --> 00:05:42,358
She's right.

62
00:05:42,978 --> 00:05:46,173
Our bodies were switched during
the electric shock the other day.

63
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,921
I'm Jang Hwa Sa.

64
00:05:50,635 --> 00:05:53,257
And she's Eulji Hae Yi.

65
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:03,070
- Attorney...
- She's the attorney.

66
00:06:03,712 --> 00:06:07,466
I'm the death row inmate, Jang Hwa Sa.

67
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:19,536
What is she saying?

68
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:23,889
What a joke...

69
00:06:33,247 --> 00:06:35,017
Wait!

70
00:06:35,017 --> 00:06:36,979
Wait...

71
00:06:38,372 --> 00:06:42,582
I'm... I'm...

72
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:48,858
I'm Inmate 122, Jang Hwa Sa.

73
00:06:50,783 --> 00:06:53,022
That's me.

74
00:06:54,909 --> 00:06:56,527
She's admitting it now.

75
00:06:57,373 --> 00:07:01,397
She may seem normal now, but we don't
know when her symptoms wills start again.

76
00:07:01,397 --> 00:07:03,608
- Doctor.
- Come on...

77
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:07,500
I guess they'll examine her there,
and follow through accordingly.

78
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,865
- Please take her to Gongju.
- Yes.

79
00:07:09,865 --> 00:07:12,185
- Get her.
- Let go of me, let go!

80
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:15,099
No, I'm not crazy.

81
00:07:15,099 --> 00:07:18,375
I'm not crazy,
I was just pretending to be crazy.

82
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,998
Why would you do that?

83
00:07:21,998 --> 00:07:25,630
I was so upset that
my sentence reduction was revoked.

84
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:29,854
I will never cause another problem.

85
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:32,759
I won't cause trouble.

86
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:56,370
I'll believe your word
that you won't cause trouble.

87
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,092
Jang Hwa Sa,
you're much smarter than I thought.

88
00:07:59,925 --> 00:08:02,392
You really screwed me over today.

89
00:08:03,661 --> 00:08:05,478
Take a temporary leave from work.

90
00:08:06,447 --> 00:08:10,099
I can't let you ruin my career anymore.

91
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:14,724
Listen carefully to what I have to say.

92
00:08:15,832 --> 00:08:18,660
Call the office,
and ask for Bang Sang Soo.

93
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,205
He's my assistant.

94
00:08:20,205 --> 00:08:22,243
That makes no sense.

95
00:08:22,243 --> 00:08:23,633
How can you take a leave?

96
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:26,088
The retrial is coming up.
What do we do about that?

97
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,927
- Attorney!
- Attorney!

98
00:08:27,927 --> 00:08:29,603
Please!

99
00:08:30,425 --> 00:08:33,699
They won't allow you to take a leave
because of the Hyoja-dong case.

100
00:08:33,699 --> 00:08:36,954
- Just ignore them.
- I'll make you a senior partner.

101
00:08:39,064 --> 00:08:41,576
Come on, pick up the phone!

102
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:48,238
<i>Whether they call or come
to the house, just ignore them.</i>

103
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:50,539
<i>I'll take care of it when I get out.
</i>

104
00:08:50,539 --> 00:08:54,441
No, that's not a good idea.

105
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,169
Get out of my house.

106
00:08:57,169 --> 00:09:01,922
Rent a room nearby
until I come up with a plan.

107
00:09:01,922 --> 00:09:04,334
You better run over when I call you.

108
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:06,974
You have so much to worry about.

109
00:09:06,974 --> 00:09:08,432
Must be a headache.

110
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:13,353
Don't sleep with Yoo Jin.

111
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:15,191
What?

112
00:09:15,191 --> 00:09:17,695
Don't sleep with Gi Yoo Jin!

113
00:09:21,516 --> 00:09:23,277
Do you understand?

114
00:09:31,887 --> 00:09:35,748
"I'm Jang Hwa Sa,
and she's Attorney Eulji Hae Yi."

115
00:09:37,146 --> 00:09:40,023
You're really great.

116
00:09:42,753 --> 00:09:47,045
Who is Jang Hwa Sa to you?

117
00:09:48,459 --> 00:09:50,507
Why is she so important to you?

118
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:59,392
I think she's my biological mother.

119
00:10:01,232 --> 00:10:04,321
Are you crazy? Who's your mother?

120
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:05,927
Who? Me?

121
00:10:10,265 --> 00:10:12,941
Why do you think Jang Hwa Sa
gave birth to you?

122
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,732
I told you to go home.
I'm tired, I want to rest.

123
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:22,814
What's your basis? I'm crazy?

124
00:10:22,814 --> 00:10:25,175
How can you say that to me?

125
00:10:25,175 --> 00:10:28,219
It wasn't easy for me to tell you,
and I said it because I trust you.

126
00:10:28,219 --> 00:10:30,443
So what's your basis for
telling me she's not my mother?

127
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:32,521
You can't be Jang Hwa Sa's son.

128
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:34,622
Because she was
Choo Young Bae's girlfriend?

129
00:10:34,622 --> 00:10:39,475
It could just be gossip, we don't
know for sure that they dated.

130
00:10:39,475 --> 00:10:43,267
Maybe they made up a scandal
to cover up the incident.

131
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:46,012
How do you know the truth?

132
00:10:46,012 --> 00:10:47,722
I know.

133
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,879
She was going to marry Choo Young Bae.

134
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,656
Chairman Gi Se Woong...

135
00:11:02,715 --> 00:11:05,396
CCTV number 1. 41.

136
00:11:05,396 --> 00:11:07,563
60.

137
00:11:07,563 --> 00:11:09,897
It's impossible to identify her.

138
00:11:09,897 --> 00:11:14,353
The video quality of
these two files are the best.

139
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:18,169
The only thing we know
is that it was a female.

140
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:20,215
Those are Louis Vuittons.

141
00:11:20,215 --> 00:11:24,815
Likely that it's a female
in her late 20s to early 40s.

142
00:11:27,873 --> 00:11:30,387
You, me...

143
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:35,512
and Jang Hwa Sa...

144
00:11:37,849 --> 00:11:42,283
are the only three who know
Choo Young Bae's name.

145
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,786
I feel an itch on the soles of my feet.

146
00:11:46,786 --> 00:11:49,973
It's not a good feeling.

147
00:12:02,103 --> 00:12:03,773
What do you think?

148
00:12:22,031 --> 00:12:23,887
Hwa Sa.

149
00:12:28,898 --> 00:12:35,444
<i>When I opened my eyes, I was stranded,
alone in a desolate and rough world.</i>

150
00:12:36,252 --> 00:12:43,147
<i>I am at the bottom
of the food chain right now.</i>

151
00:12:49,161 --> 00:12:53,586
Jang Hwa Sa hasn't had her
glucose tolerance test yet, right?

152
00:12:53,586 --> 00:12:55,684
I'll go check.

153
00:12:56,528 --> 00:13:01,292
Then please take this to the lab too.

154
00:13:01,292 --> 00:13:03,249
Please run an STR analysis.

155
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,137
Okay.

156
00:13:05,137 --> 00:13:08,397
Please be sure to keep
the patient's information confidential.

157
00:13:22,776 --> 00:13:24,347
Wait...

158
00:13:24,347 --> 00:13:27,416
Who was in charge here
while I was gone?

159
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,969
She took your spot while you were gone.

160
00:13:29,969 --> 00:13:32,099
Then can you continue to be in charge?

161
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:35,261
Everybody complained while you were gone.

162
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:37,272
They all said it tasted bad.

163
00:13:37,593 --> 00:13:41,734
They're complaining about taste eating
food bought with taxpayers' money?

164
00:13:44,056 --> 00:13:46,637
Hwa Sa.

165
00:13:46,637 --> 00:13:48,230
Are the rumors true?

166
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:53,252
I heard you banged your head on the floor
from an electric shock and became dumb.

167
00:13:53,252 --> 00:13:55,924
You're not your usual self.

168
00:13:55,924 --> 00:13:58,717
The way you talk, and just your aura...

169
00:13:59,887 --> 00:14:01,912
It's true, I became dumb.

170
00:14:02,569 --> 00:14:04,968
Wait...

171
00:14:12,849 --> 00:14:16,200
<i>If I don't want to die
being buried in this trash</i>

172
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,175
<i>there's only one thing for me to do.</i>

173
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:23,454
<i>I need to pretend to be
Jang Hwa Sa and just wait...</i>

174
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:29,708
<i>until I find a way to return
to being Eulji Hae Yi.</i>

175
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:32,342
<i>I need to hang in here.</i>

176
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:39,860
- Call her house and cell phone.
- Okay.

177
00:14:41,815 --> 00:14:43,017
Boss!

178
00:14:46,999 --> 00:14:50,858
The head attorney's still not here?

179
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:52,843
That...

180
00:14:52,843 --> 00:14:56,920
I think the damage from the shock
was worse than we thought.

181
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,989
She's not dead.

182
00:14:58,989 --> 00:15:02,271
- If she didn't die, she should be here.
- She's not picking up?

183
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:05,193
Maybe she'll come straight to Suite 403.

184
00:15:06,335 --> 00:15:07,778
You better resolve this.

185
00:15:07,778 --> 00:15:11,358
I'll crush this team
if something goes wrong.

186
00:15:13,398 --> 00:15:15,031
You're not even picking up the phone?

187
00:15:15,031 --> 00:15:17,007
How can you disappear
at a time like this?

188
00:15:19,363 --> 00:15:21,209
<i>Who is it?</i>

189
00:15:23,864 --> 00:15:26,503
You have a package.

190
00:15:26,503 --> 00:15:28,801
Package?

191
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:31,028
Leave it in front of the door.

192
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:35,408
The recipient needs to pay.
I can't leave until I get the money.

193
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:42,527
How...

194
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,113
How much?

195
00:15:44,113 --> 00:15:46,406
- Seriously...
- Wait!

196
00:15:46,406 --> 00:15:48,660
Excuse me! Who are you?

197
00:15:53,747 --> 00:15:56,300
Oh, no! What do we do?

198
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,198
You must still be in shock!

199
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:01,900
How could you forget this face?

200
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,162
Your assistant, Bang Sang Soo.

201
00:16:05,162 --> 00:16:07,929
We lived in the same study dorm.
I was the sixth floor neighbor.

202
00:16:07,929 --> 00:16:11,080
Because of that connection,
you hired me as the intern.

203
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,263
Bang Sang Soo!

204
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,698
<i>Call the office,
and ask for Bang Sang Soo.</i>

205
00:16:15,698 --> 00:16:17,645
<i>He's my assistant.</i>

206
00:16:17,645 --> 00:16:19,386
Attorney!

207
00:16:22,403 --> 00:16:24,378
Oh...

208
00:16:24,378 --> 00:16:26,453
I can't even joke around with you?

209
00:16:29,224 --> 00:16:31,410
You're the head attorney!

210
00:16:31,410 --> 00:16:34,041
What will happen
if you don't show up to court?

211
00:16:34,648 --> 00:16:37,669
How can I go to the trial right now?

212
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:42,454
Is getting an electric shock
is some deadly disease?

213
00:16:42,454 --> 00:16:44,513
That's not the case.

214
00:16:44,513 --> 00:16:48,209
If you really can't stand
it that much, just resign!

215
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,466
Oh... Resignation!

216
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:03,055
Resignation.

217
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:11,793
Please save me.

218
00:17:11,793 --> 00:17:13,784
If you do this, I'll get fired.

219
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:17,840
They even put up a huge banner in
my hometown that I got hired at Damjang.

220
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,192
Attorney, my senior...
Ms. Hae Yi.

221
00:17:21,389 --> 00:17:24,221
I'm so sorry.

222
00:17:26,955 --> 00:17:28,500
Fine.

223
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,940
You want to quit.

224
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,692
Still, this isn't etiquette.

225
00:17:32,692 --> 00:17:35,172
If you just give in your letter,
that's the end?

226
00:17:35,172 --> 00:17:38,801
Return the company credit card,
and turn the case over to someone else.

227
00:17:38,801 --> 00:17:44,380
Take out Ms. Han and our team
out to dinner, too! This is absurd!

228
00:17:45,859 --> 00:17:50,689
Oh, you can submit this yourself.
Go to the firm, and give it in yourself.

229
00:17:50,689 --> 00:17:53,009
- Do it yourself, hurry.
- No...

230
00:18:06,054 --> 00:18:10,146
I knew all attorneys
were con artists, but...

231
00:18:10,146 --> 00:18:12,381
Come on, you're the head
of all of them.

232
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,453
Now that you're here, aren't you
getting excited about the battle?

233
00:18:16,453 --> 00:18:18,039
Attorney!

234
00:18:18,619 --> 00:18:22,629
I brought this from the office.
It's your favorite.

235
00:18:22,629 --> 00:18:25,488
Even if I want to do this,
I can't.

236
00:18:25,488 --> 00:18:27,926
- I don't know anything.
- You can scan over everything.

237
00:18:27,926 --> 00:18:30,466
There's not much that's new
since today's the first day of the trial.

238
00:18:30,466 --> 00:18:32,021
No...

239
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,852
It's Chairman Gi San!

240
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,399
No...

241
00:18:45,399 --> 00:18:47,523
It's Chairman Gi San!

242
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:57,674
Chairman Gi San, are you here to
attend Gi Chan Sung's appeals trial?

243
00:18:57,674 --> 00:19:00,421
Despite the non-guilty verdict
at his first trial

244
00:19:00,421 --> 00:19:03,728
over millions of citizens
have requested for a retrial.

245
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:05,358
Were you aware of this?

246
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:07,573
- Please make a statement.
- Please say something.

247
00:19:07,573 --> 00:19:08,980
What's the truth?

248
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,639
Chairman.

249
00:19:11,176 --> 00:19:14,255
- How do you feel?
- Is it true?

250
00:19:14,255 --> 00:19:16,244
Please say something.

251
00:19:16,244 --> 00:19:18,183
- Is it true?
- Chairman Gi San!

252
00:19:19,438 --> 00:19:21,513
Nice to meet you, Attorney Eulji.

253
00:19:36,694 --> 00:19:38,592
What are you doing, Hae Yi?

254
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:03,155
All rise.

255
00:20:11,496 --> 00:20:12,926
You may sit.

256
00:20:23,123 --> 00:20:25,321
It's time. What do we do?

257
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,377
Attor...

258
00:20:29,513 --> 00:20:34,417
We'll have to change the case's
attorney to me, I'll go in and...

259
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,062
I'm sorry.

260
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:03,707
Excuse us.

261
00:21:03,707 --> 00:21:06,465
I'm sorry. Excuse us.

262
00:21:15,305 --> 00:21:18,888
<i>He's sitting over there.</i>

263
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,804
<i>The Choo Young Bae
that I supposedly killed</i>

264
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:28,246
<i>is alive and well in front of me.</i>

265
00:21:32,821 --> 00:21:34,846
What took you so long?

266
00:21:36,682 --> 00:21:38,706
What happened, Young Bae?

267
00:21:38,706 --> 00:21:40,719
What's wrong? What happened?

268
00:21:40,719 --> 00:21:43,096
Oh, no...

269
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:08,618
I won't send you away alone.

270
00:22:21,157 --> 00:22:25,472
Wherever it may be...

271
00:22:29,053 --> 00:22:31,263
I'll meet you there.

272
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,109
<i>Defense, can you not hear me?</i>

273
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,131
Defense!

274
00:22:46,295 --> 00:22:48,109
Attorney Eulji Hae Yi!

275
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:50,132
Please sit down.

276
00:22:54,007 --> 00:22:59,800
Let us begin the first appeals trial

277
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,250
for the Hyoja intersection
pedestrian death case.

278
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,207
The main issue from the last trial

279
00:23:07,207 --> 00:23:10,600
was whether the accident was
due to a mechanical error in the car...

280
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,237
or due to the reckless driving
of the defendant.

281
00:23:14,237 --> 00:23:19,244
Prosecutor, do you have evidence or
a witness to prove the defendant's guilt?

282
00:23:19,244 --> 00:23:25,163
I call Oh Bong Sam as a witness, who
was the detective in charge of the case.

283
00:23:30,753 --> 00:23:35,925
This NFS report states there was damage
to the defendant's vehicle's brake hose.

284
00:23:35,925 --> 00:23:38,074
You believe there
is a problem with this?

285
00:23:38,074 --> 00:23:39,815
There is definitely a problem.

286
00:23:39,815 --> 00:23:43,477
That report was written after the vehicle
was moved to Hyoja inspection facility.

287
00:23:43,477 --> 00:23:47,317
Examiner Lee Sang Hee wrote that
report himself after examining the car.

288
00:23:48,138 --> 00:23:55,346
I heard from Examiner Lee that the report
would be ready by 4 p.m. on the 26th.

289
00:23:55,346 --> 00:23:58,847
- The brake hose is fine, right?
- Come on...

290
00:23:58,847 --> 00:24:01,310
I don't even want to
come out here because of you.

291
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:04,763
- Come on, please...
- Get away from me.

292
00:24:04,763 --> 00:24:07,679
Hey, you can't be here.

293
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,627
What's so hard about
telling me this?

294
00:24:12,644 --> 00:24:15,534
It will be ready in one hour,
two hours at most...

295
00:24:15,534 --> 00:24:17,607
Leave, I need to work.

296
00:24:17,654 --> 00:24:19,745
- Two hours?
- Yeah.

297
00:24:19,745 --> 00:24:21,423
- Two hours!
- Yeah!

298
00:24:21,423 --> 00:24:23,564
Okay, I'll see you in two hours.

299
00:24:23,564 --> 00:24:28,408
For some reason, that report came out
the next day on the 27th around 4 p.m.

300
00:24:28,408 --> 00:24:32,671
On average, vehicle inspections
take about two to three hours.

301
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:38,043
Why do you think this report
was delayed for over 24 hours?

302
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:41,238
Let's first check the document number.

303
00:24:41,238 --> 00:24:44,011
It's number 0978, right?

304
00:24:44,011 --> 00:24:46,440
2017-T- 0978.

305
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,663
The NFS uses consecutive numbers
to keep track of its documents.

306
00:24:49,663 --> 00:24:53,701
Number 0976 was the Wangsimni
pedestrian death case report.

307
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,926
And 0978 was submitted as
the document number for this case.

308
00:24:56,926 --> 00:25:01,625
Then where is Document 0977?

309
00:25:03,644 --> 00:25:09,430
Document 0977 is missing,
and 0978 reports of a failed brake.

310
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,600
I propose the possibility that
the document may have been tampered with.

311
00:25:13,199 --> 00:25:14,919
I have no further questions.

312
00:25:17,948 --> 00:25:20,794
Defense, you may begin
your cross-examination.

313
00:25:27,572 --> 00:25:31,850
Defense, will you not
cross-examine the witness?

314
00:25:37,822 --> 00:25:40,642
No, I won't.

315
00:26:05,932 --> 00:26:08,736
You were going to submit it anyway,
so here.

316
00:26:21,465 --> 00:26:24,571
How dare you try to ruin my son!

317
00:26:24,571 --> 00:26:26,938
Chairman, please don't do this.

318
00:26:26,938 --> 00:26:29,276
I don't know how
that information was leaked

319
00:26:29,276 --> 00:26:32,128
but she couldn't possibly have
planned out a counterattack.

320
00:26:32,128 --> 00:26:36,453
Did Jang Hwa Sa tell you to ruin my son?

321
00:26:41,307 --> 00:26:44,350
- Please don't do this.
- Say it!

322
00:26:46,524 --> 00:26:48,446
Please, Chairman...

323
00:26:52,685 --> 00:26:54,462
Chairman! Chairman!

324
00:26:54,462 --> 00:26:56,551
Chairman!

325
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:22,400
<i>Whenever you want...</i>

326
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,734
<i>Whenever you want...</i>

327
00:27:27,858 --> 00:27:34,656
<i>Cry whenever you miss me.</i>

328
00:27:42,711 --> 00:27:45,182
How did the trial go?
It went as expected?

329
00:28:06,708 --> 00:28:12,308
- You had someone follow me around?
- Why are you meeting Jang Hwa Sa?

330
00:28:13,234 --> 00:28:16,478
- Because she could be my mother.
- I told you she's not.

331
00:28:16,478 --> 00:28:19,423
- She's not your mom.
- Whenever her name is mentioned

332
00:28:19,423 --> 00:28:22,925
- why do you overreact?
- I told you I would find your birth mom.

333
00:28:23,779 --> 00:28:25,972
Just wait patiently.

334
00:28:34,097 --> 00:28:36,157
No.

335
00:28:36,157 --> 00:28:40,157
I'll find my mother myself.

336
00:28:40,157 --> 00:28:41,744
Yoo Jin.

337
00:28:42,776 --> 00:28:44,061
Yoo Jin!

339
00:29:05,407 --> 00:29:09,876
You know all schools are haunted
by begrudging and restless spirits?

340
00:29:09,876 --> 00:29:12,666
Spirits of dead inmates...

341
00:29:13,697 --> 00:29:19,011
You are eating sweets again?
You know you shouldn't eat those.

342
00:29:20,099 --> 00:29:22,822
It's not my own body, so who cares?

343
00:29:27,326 --> 00:29:29,839
My body is owned by the nation.

344
00:29:31,726 --> 00:29:35,592
- Continue what you were saying.
- It was Inmate 1182.

345
00:29:35,592 --> 00:29:39,399
She insisted that she
didn't kill her husband

346
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:42,465
but she still got hanged.

347
00:29:42,465 --> 00:29:46,108
Ever since then, whenever it rains,
they hear her crying...

348
00:29:46,108 --> 00:29:48,996
Hey, that's enough.
All schools have those ghost stories.

349
00:29:48,996 --> 00:29:50,612
I'm tired of it.

350
00:29:50,612 --> 00:29:52,909
- "I didn't kill him..."
- Come on!

351
00:29:52,909 --> 00:29:55,579
- "I didn't do it..."
- How childish...

352
00:29:55,579 --> 00:29:57,830
That's enough.
I won't be able to sleep tonight.

353
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:01,333
<i>The truly scary place is
our medical supplies room.</i>

354
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,564
<i>- You were here?
- Yes...</i>

355
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:10,167
<i>Let's sit.</i>

356
00:30:10,167 --> 00:30:13,115
<i>- Professor Kim is well?
- Yes, he's well.</i>

357
00:30:15,263 --> 00:30:17,476
<i>I mean it.</i>

358
00:30:17,476 --> 00:30:19,892
<i>I'm sure it's haunted.</i>

359
00:30:19,892 --> 00:30:21,436
What was that?

360
00:30:21,436 --> 00:30:25,456
That's why Hwa Sa changed.
She's a completely different person.

361
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:30,163
<i>Junk?</i>

362
00:30:32,882 --> 00:30:37,010
<i>I thought it was just
an electric shock...</i>

363
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,314
Where's the pickled shrimp?

364
00:30:41,283 --> 00:30:44,380
Oh my goodness, you drank a
whole bottle of this sweet juice?

365
00:30:45,034 --> 00:30:47,426
I like the peach flavor, too.

366
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:50,035
Peach?

367
00:30:50,564 --> 00:30:52,857
- It's the peach flavored one.
- Peach...

368
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:55,136
Hwa Sa.

369
00:30:55,136 --> 00:30:56,887
Medical Director!

370
00:30:59,076 --> 00:31:01,597
I can't breathe.

371
00:31:01,597 --> 00:31:04,638
- I can't breathe.
- What's wrong?

372
00:31:05,872 --> 00:31:10,532
- I have allergies...
- What allergy?

373
00:31:10,532 --> 00:31:13,446
That's your favorite, the peach flavor!

374
00:31:19,525 --> 00:31:24,351
Hwa Sa, what's gotten into you?

375
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:28,457
I guess I just got dumb.

376
00:31:29,398 --> 00:31:31,087
It's okay, go back to work.

377
00:31:31,087 --> 00:31:33,517
Okay.

378
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,827
Stop right there!

379
00:32:20,267 --> 00:32:22,086
<i>[Social Justice Attorneys Group]</i>

380
00:32:22,086 --> 00:32:24,511
Is this how you treat a guest?

381
00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:28,484
- Not even dumplings?
- This isn't some fancy law firm.

382
00:32:28,484 --> 00:32:32,263
It's a private group run by whatever
fees our clients can afford to pay.

383
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:36,726
Gosh, you scared me!

384
00:32:36,726 --> 00:32:38,741
What brings you here
without even calling first?

385
00:32:43,332 --> 00:32:45,938
It's all cold now.

386
00:32:45,938 --> 00:32:49,560
Still, I brought this for you.

387
00:32:50,894 --> 00:32:55,073
I'm Attorney Kang Sung Tae from
the Social Justice Attorneys Group.

388
00:32:56,419 --> 00:33:00,340
I definitely believe
that you're innocent.

389
00:33:13,966 --> 00:33:22,704
I want to know what happened during
the 19 hours Jang Hwa Sa was unconscious.

390
00:33:22,704 --> 00:33:28,812
I came to ask you why you believe
Jang Hwa Sa is innocent.

391
00:33:42,636 --> 00:33:45,024
The passcode to the safe...

392
00:33:48,677 --> 00:33:51,987
Come on, let's just leave.

393
00:33:51,987 --> 00:33:54,560
That's money that will go towards
the employees' paychecks.

394
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:17,831
Look over there.

395
00:34:19,574 --> 00:34:22,907
That's my father, Gi Se Woong.

396
00:34:24,815 --> 00:34:26,884
Pretty awesome, right?

397
00:34:28,882 --> 00:34:32,380
But none of that belongs to me.

398
00:34:35,813 --> 00:34:38,253
I'm not stealing.

399
00:34:38,253 --> 00:34:41,750
For the abandoned son
that must leave this country...

400
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:45,136
This is the least that
Gi Se Woong can do as a father.

401
00:34:50,027 --> 00:34:52,168
Hwa Sa.

402
00:35:47,333 --> 00:35:48,866
Who are you?

403
00:36:15,058 --> 00:36:17,558
You're... Gi San?

404
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,208
You know me?

405
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,199
Who are you?

406
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:29,244
I'm your younger brother, you jerk!

407
00:36:29,976 --> 00:36:31,072
Damn!

408
00:36:41,315 --> 00:36:43,163
You!

409
00:36:57,257 --> 00:37:00,096
- Let go!
- You're stealing!

410
00:37:00,096 --> 00:37:01,799
I'm not stealing!

411
00:37:01,799 --> 00:37:04,393
I'm taking what's rightfully mine,
so who's going to stop me?

412
00:37:04,393 --> 00:37:06,967
I'm Gi Se Woong's son,
Choo Young Bae!

413
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:24,500
<i>To be honest, we also don't know</i>

414
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:29,002
what happened on December 24, 1984

415
00:37:29,002 --> 00:37:30,784
or what the truth is.

416
00:37:30,784 --> 00:37:33,152
Perhaps Ms. Jang Hwa Sa
is the only one who knows.

417
00:37:33,152 --> 00:37:36,170
No, she doesn't know either.

418
00:37:39,036 --> 00:37:43,985
Then how can you be so sure
that Jang Hwa Sa is innocent?

419
00:37:50,730 --> 00:37:52,489
Yeah, Honey.

420
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:56,558
They're all there? They came early.

421
00:37:58,163 --> 00:38:02,643
Okay, start with wine.
I'll be there soon.

422
00:38:02,643 --> 00:38:04,052
Okay.

423
00:38:06,268 --> 00:38:08,918
<i>What I'm focusing on</i>

424
00:38:08,918 --> 00:38:10,199
are these people.

425
00:38:10,199 --> 00:38:14,223
The ones who received
free rides into SHC.

426
00:38:17,188 --> 00:38:19,154
You know him better than us.

427
00:38:19,154 --> 00:38:20,984
Ma Hyun Cheol.

428
00:38:28,625 --> 00:38:32,964
<i>He was Ms. Jang Hwa Sa's
public defender in 1984.</i>

429
00:38:32,964 --> 00:38:34,775
I'm the public defender,
Ma Hyun Cheol.

430
00:38:34,775 --> 00:38:40,016
Officially, he's the managing director
of Damjang, Korea's top law firm.

431
00:38:41,223 --> 00:38:44,221
<i>Although Gi San
is the actual owner of the firm.</i>

432
00:38:45,623 --> 00:38:49,810
- This is so uncomfortable...
- It's only a trial.

433
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:54,185
- Don't worry too much, Chan Sung.
- I'm not worried at all, Uncle.

434
00:38:54,185 --> 00:38:55,935
I have my dad.

435
00:38:55,935 --> 00:38:59,237
That's enough about Chan Sung.

436
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:04,900
- It's time to enjoy Chan Sung's steak.
- You're a chef, Chan Sung.

437
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:09,576
The 580 gram steak
for our top attorney...

438
00:39:09,576 --> 00:39:13,402
Wow, I'm so amazed.

439
00:39:13,402 --> 00:39:16,159
I know a thing or two about
grilling meat too, don't you agree?

440
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:21,585
But mine never has this luxurious taste
that your meat has.

441
00:39:21,585 --> 00:39:25,618
Attorney Ma, that's not the taste
of meat, that's the taste of money.

442
00:39:25,618 --> 00:39:27,165
<i>Busan District Prosecutor,
Kim Jong Soo.</i>

443
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:29,078
Sign of a high life, no?

444
00:39:29,078 --> 00:39:31,868
<i>He was the head detective
of Jongro Homicide Department</i>

445
00:39:31,868 --> 00:39:34,089
<i>and in charge of
Jang Hwa Sa's case.</i>

446
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:36,772
<i>Once he bit into something,
he never let go</i>

447
00:39:36,772 --> 00:39:38,868
<i>so his nickname was "Pit Bull Terrier."</i>

448
00:39:38,868 --> 00:39:40,522
He quit as a detective soon after

449
00:39:40,522 --> 00:39:44,103
and became a prosecutor
after passing the bar exam.

450
00:39:44,103 --> 00:39:46,850
Ever since then,
he's been living the good life.

451
00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:52,605
- Here, this is for Director Bong.
- Oh, please, Chairman.

452
00:39:52,605 --> 00:39:55,194
It's been long since
I decided to go vegan.

453
00:39:55,194 --> 00:39:56,717
<i>Bong Sa Dal.</i>

454
00:39:56,717 --> 00:40:00,590
<i>He's the current director of
SHC Group's Sanae Hospital.</i>

455
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:05,860
<i>Back then, he did Choo Young Bae's
autopsy as the NFS's medical examiner.</i>

456
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,980
So handsome.

457
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,406
A man has to be strong.

458
00:40:10,406 --> 00:40:12,496
You can't get strong
by eating grass.

459
00:40:13,295 --> 00:40:18,746
We're expected to live into our 100s now.
Meat has a lot of cholesterol.

460
00:40:18,746 --> 00:40:20,694
It's not good for the arteries.

461
00:40:20,694 --> 00:40:23,739
Living into our 100s...
That's nice.

462
00:40:23,739 --> 00:40:27,527
I'll live to be 120,
eating lots of good food.

463
00:40:27,527 --> 00:40:31,406
I'll sit back and enjoy
the Chan Sung era.

464
00:40:31,406 --> 00:40:33,199
Bravo!

465
00:40:33,875 --> 00:40:37,427
Good food and long life
don't go hand in hand.

466
00:40:38,426 --> 00:40:42,302
<i>You think it's coincidence that
all these people are by Gi San?</i>

467
00:40:43,304 --> 00:40:47,217
Park Chul Soon.
He was the investigator back then.

468
00:40:47,217 --> 00:40:49,567
<i>And he was the first one
at the incident site.</i>

469
00:40:50,574 --> 00:40:53,139
<i>He's now a director at SHC Group.</i>

470
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:56,047
<i>And Gi San's right hand man.</i>

471
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,350
Who's this woman?

472
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:09,181
She's Kim Jong Soo's younger sister.

473
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:14,292
- Jong Soo...
- Miss, he's absolutely right.

474
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:16,824
I am living the high life.

475
00:41:16,824 --> 00:41:21,317
<i>After the incident, she married Gi San
as soon as she finished high school.</i>

476
00:41:25,663 --> 00:41:31,159
Maybe the cost of
the free ride into SHC was...

477
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:33,962
Jang Hwa Sa.

478
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:43,614
But we don't have any evidence.

479
00:41:43,614 --> 00:41:49,636
It's unfortunate, but I have no idea what
kinds of deals were made between them.

480
00:41:53,085 --> 00:41:55,085
I...

481
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:58,851
Oh, okay...

482
00:41:59,455 --> 00:42:01,846
You look into it now.

483
00:42:01,846 --> 00:42:04,614
I've come up with nothing so far

484
00:42:04,614 --> 00:42:08,674
but you're a smart girl,
so I'm sure you will figure it out.

485
00:42:19,248 --> 00:42:20,397
Hae Yi.

486
00:42:20,397 --> 00:42:24,708
Before this case becomes
a bygone of history

487
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:31,714
I hope you will find the answers
for Ms. Jang Hwa Sa.

488
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,498
Hae Yi!

489
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:51,409
She left?

490
00:42:54,429 --> 00:42:56,806
My daughter's acting strange.

491
00:42:56,806 --> 00:42:59,652
How? She looks fine to me.

<i>The reason you tried to kill me
was so that you could have all this?</i>

498
00:44:50,323 --> 00:44:51,843
Hello.

00:44:58,544 --> 00:44:59,900

Hwa Sa!

502
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:08,244
Seriously...

503
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,996
<i>Who is she?
Why is she so hyper?</i>

504
00:45:13,996 --> 00:45:16,155
<i>How does she know Jang Hwa Sa?</i>

505
00:45:16,155 --> 00:45:19,061
Why are you so cold to me?

506
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:33,400
What's going on?
You're not your usual self.

507
00:45:37,972 --> 00:45:40,086
You've gotten younger.

508
00:45:41,633 --> 00:45:43,345
Younger?

509
00:45:44,483 --> 00:45:46,742
What the heck...

510
00:45:48,224 --> 00:45:52,780
You pushed your mother onto me,
and you're living comfortably here.

511
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:57,947
That's why you got younger.
Your mother is driving me nuts.

512
00:45:57,947 --> 00:45:59,628
Can't we hire a nurse?

513
00:45:59,628 --> 00:46:03,153
That Eulji whatever girl said
she would pay for one.

514
00:46:04,059 --> 00:46:06,046
Eulji Hae Yi?

515
00:46:06,046 --> 00:46:08,086
How do you know Hae Yi?

516
00:46:08,086 --> 00:46:11,231
How do you know her?

517
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:14,349
You're not the one who sent her there?

518
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:24,769
I have a favor to ask.

519
00:46:26,008 --> 00:46:27,878
What is it?

520
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,456
I'm the public defender,
Ma Hyun Cheol.

521
00:47:08,348 --> 00:47:12,804
- I never hired a lawyer.
- I volunteered.

522
00:47:12,804 --> 00:47:16,075
This is that infamous case
that's stirred up all of Korea

523
00:47:16,075 --> 00:47:17,997
so how can a lawyer not get involved?

524
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,862
Ms. Jang Hwa Sa?

525
00:47:20,862 --> 00:47:25,121
I'm the one who will save your life,
Ma Hyun Cheol.

526
00:47:37,525 --> 00:47:40,565
Attorney Eulji. Hey.

527
00:47:40,565 --> 00:47:43,821
Why are you staring into space?

528
00:47:44,435 --> 00:47:46,005
What's going on?

529
00:47:46,005 --> 00:47:49,250
I don't want to quit
the Gi Chan Sung case.

530
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:53,900
That's not up to you.

531
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:59,714
He was about to kill you.

532
00:47:59,714 --> 00:48:03,299
- You need me to say more?
- I'll convince him.

533
00:48:03,299 --> 00:48:05,920
Please let me meet
Chairman Gi San.

534
00:48:11,936 --> 00:48:14,304
I'm sorry.

535
00:48:15,766 --> 00:48:18,585
I think you need to get this now.

536
00:48:19,328 --> 00:48:21,898
It's the nursing home.

537
00:48:25,154 --> 00:48:27,154
- Ma'am.
- Yes.

538
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,987
Where am I going?

539
00:48:28,987 --> 00:48:31,139
You're going on a field trip.

540
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:35,197
- Transferring her?
- They even brought an ambulance.

541
00:48:35,197 --> 00:48:38,116
- Please go ahead without me.
- Who, to where?

542
00:48:38,116 --> 00:48:41,400
She wouldn't tell us where she's going,
so we don't know either.

543
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,755
I'll be right there. Keep them there.

544
00:48:43,755 --> 00:48:45,547
Don't let them leave before I get there.

545
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,397
Oh, nice weather.

546
00:48:50,634 --> 00:48:55,375
Hey, if you keep that up,
you'll end up getting implants.

547
00:48:55,375 --> 00:48:56,596
You don't even have money.

548
00:48:56,596 --> 00:49:00,036
Why does our country
only have six seasons?

549
00:49:00,036 --> 00:49:03,201
You haven't read the textbooks?
There are four seasons in Korea.

550
00:49:03,201 --> 00:49:05,415
The beauty of our nation, you know...

551
00:49:06,571 --> 00:49:09,590
Early summer, summer, late summer,
early winter, winter, late winter...

552
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,920
I'm going to lose it.

553
00:49:15,058 --> 00:49:17,728
- Look at that crazy driver...
- What?

554
00:49:17,728 --> 00:49:19,436
Look at him speeding.

555
00:49:19,436 --> 00:49:23,924
This is why I can't even
eat my lunch in peace.

556
00:49:23,924 --> 00:49:24,987
Damn it.

557
00:49:25,873 --> 00:49:29,884
Such a hard worker...
What a good cop.

558
00:49:35,446 --> 00:49:37,886
Law Firm Damjang, stop the car.

559
00:49:39,315 --> 00:49:41,792
Damjang, stop the car!

560
00:49:42,183 --> 00:49:44,757
You know I only have
a temporary license right now?

561
00:49:44,757 --> 00:49:47,754
<i>Come on, stop the car!
It's hot today.</i>

562
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:55,808
Law Firm Damjang, stop the car.

563
00:49:55,808 --> 00:49:59,690
Damjang with the top lawyers
of our nation!

564
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:02,676
Don't annoy me on this hot day,
and stop the car.

565
00:50:17,678 --> 00:50:19,955
Officer Oh Bong Sam.

566
00:50:19,955 --> 00:50:22,368
What are you trying to do now?

567
00:50:22,368 --> 00:50:24,288
Let me look at your
temporary license.

568
00:50:30,210 --> 00:50:33,743
I'm asking because I'm really curious.

569
00:50:33,743 --> 00:50:36,676
How did you get that info
on the missing document?

570
00:50:38,669 --> 00:50:40,727
I need to go.

571
00:50:43,828 --> 00:50:46,000
Are you sick?

572
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,859
I need to go right now!

573
00:50:49,652 --> 00:50:52,033
Why are you yelling?

574
00:50:52,033 --> 00:50:56,341
Oh, are you mad because
I got you good at the courthouse?

575
00:50:58,158 --> 00:51:01,698
Attorney Eulji has to go to Yongin
right now, to a nursing home.

576
00:51:01,698 --> 00:51:03,571
Why?

577
00:51:09,500 --> 00:51:13,134
There will be a lot of traffic to Yongin.

578
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:18,544
Oh, no... It's totally red.

579
00:51:18,544 --> 00:51:21,826
Gangnam, Bugang, Yangjae...

580
00:51:21,826 --> 00:51:24,160
You'll get there after the sun sets.

581
00:51:33,826 --> 00:51:35,223
D3, D3...

582
00:51:35,223 --> 00:51:36,247
This is 602.

583
00:51:36,247 --> 00:51:37,511
I have an emergency patient.

584
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:41,053
I need to take her to a hospital,
send someone to cover my shift.

585
00:52:17,596 --> 00:52:20,946
- What took you so long?
- Where is she?

586
00:52:21,747 --> 00:52:23,080
Wait...

587
00:52:23,703 --> 00:52:26,587
I paid you back for that NFS document.

588
00:52:33,955 --> 00:52:36,810
You're embarrassing me.

589
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:38,355
Honey, I need to go.

590
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:40,071
<i>Okay, Baby.</i>

591
00:52:40,071 --> 00:52:41,631
<i>Bye.</i>

592
00:52:42,899 --> 00:52:45,107
You came so quickly, Attorney.

593
00:52:45,107 --> 00:52:47,830
- Where did you move her to?
- Why do you want to know that?

594
00:52:47,830 --> 00:52:50,178
Where did you move her
without my permission?

595
00:52:51,029 --> 00:52:53,288
My goodness, you're so weird.

596
00:52:53,288 --> 00:52:56,812
That's up to the guardian.
Why does she need your permission?

597
00:52:56,812 --> 00:52:58,404
Look.

598
00:52:58,404 --> 00:53:00,609
Guardian, Jang Hwa Sa.

599
00:53:03,352 --> 00:53:05,986
And I'm the procurator,
Gam Mi Ran.

600
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:15,819
I'll give you money.

601
00:53:16,551 --> 00:53:18,652
Oh, money...

602
00:53:18,652 --> 00:53:21,064
Attorneys have a lot of money.

603
00:53:21,064 --> 00:53:26,178
But people like us have loyalty, too.

604
00:53:26,178 --> 00:53:29,703
And stop talking down to me.
You're much younger than me.

605
00:53:34,649 --> 00:53:37,200
Are you that curious?

606
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,745
"If you're curious, come see me."

607
00:53:43,049 --> 00:53:45,500
That's what Hwa Sa told me to tell you.

608
00:53:58,223 --> 00:53:59,245
Doctor.

609
00:53:59,609 --> 00:54:01,975
This is the result of the STR analysis.

610
00:54:02,783 --> 00:54:04,343
- Thanks.
- Sure thing.

611
00:54:42,605 --> 00:54:45,250
- You finally came.
- Where did you send my mom?

612
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:48,379
I've been trying not to make
trouble here as you told me

613
00:54:48,379 --> 00:54:51,716
so I've been working in the kitchen.
Everyone's throwing a fit.

614
00:54:51,716 --> 00:54:53,386
They're saying how bad it tastes.

615
00:54:55,127 --> 00:54:58,390
Explain to me how
you're supposed to make this.

616
00:54:58,390 --> 00:55:01,980
- My mom!
- I thought I was totally powerless.

617
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:05,712
But there's a lot more
I can do than I thought.

618
00:55:05,712 --> 00:55:08,216
Where did you move my mom?

619
00:55:08,216 --> 00:55:12,022
Whoa, whoa, whoa... Calm down.

620
00:55:13,274 --> 00:55:15,815
I guess I have the upper hand now.

621
00:55:16,841 --> 00:55:18,375
Sit down.

622
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:31,522
You're probably hungry at this time.

623
00:55:31,522 --> 00:55:34,194
Try it.

624
00:55:37,418 --> 00:55:39,799
This is part of our deal.

625
00:55:39,799 --> 00:55:42,699
I need your honest opinion.

626
00:55:42,699 --> 00:55:43,985
Eat it.

627
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,259
Oh, I heard that's your favorite.

00:57:10,913 --> 00:57:14,991
