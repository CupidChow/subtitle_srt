- Hi, you're here.
- You like it?

4
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:39,070
It's so simple.

5
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:40,490
Do I seem too materialistic?

6
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:42,560
Minimalism, minimum life.

7
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,290
I'm not good with those concepts.

8
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,900
You didn't show her what I picked out during lunchtime.

9
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,900
I'm sorry. I didn't know it was for her.

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,400
We can engrave on this.

11
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:57,270
I was thinking, "Veritas." What do you think?

12
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:06,190
I was getting bored waiting for you.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,650
So pretty!

14
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,460
Totally my taste!

15
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,530
It's too thin to put an engraving on it.

16
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,520

This one.

20
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,740
- A set of matching rings?
- Yeah, matching rings.

21
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,830
- You got a problem with that?
- Oh, no.

22
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,190
Not at all. I'll be back.

23
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,940
Engrave a word on it. "Veritas."

00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,310

- Wow, a matching ring!

Veritas...

41
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,350
It's a Latin word.

42
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,560
Truth, trust, faith.

43
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,430
It's not the type of common trust people always bring up.

44
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:59,700
It's an absolute truth between two people

45
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,670
and absolute trust.

46
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,570

Thank you for the Seochodong incident.

57

At the resort...

58
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,240
What are you doing?

59
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,800
That's a lot of stitches.

60
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,770
When did you get hurt?

61
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,530
That's pretty bad.

62
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,640
At the resort last time. Right?

63
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,300
- Let go.
- It's a sharp cut. Glass?

64
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,600
- I said let go!
- How did you get this cut!

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,840
If you know how I got hurt...

66
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,170
Are you allowed to question just anyone like a suspect if you're a detective?

67
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,390
So...

68
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,190
you just have to tell me how and where you got hurt.

69
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:25,700
Two days ago at home.

70
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,130
I hurt myself grieving for the director.

71
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,380
I broke my wine glass while drinking.

72
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,060
Which hospital? The name.

73
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,670
Why are you being so obsessive about this?

74
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,730
Are you interested in me?

75
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,570
I'm worried for you. So what?

76
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,000
Is it that hard to tell me the name of the hospital?

77
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,920
I don't know why you're doing this, but

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,200
I told everything I need to say at the reference witness questioning.

79
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,380
I heard he's your friend.

80
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,930
If you're curious, ask Detective Park.

81
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:10,740
If you want to know more, bring me a warrant or subpoena.

How will you explain the bruises on your legs that I saw in Park Chul Soon's room?

85
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,310
I'm pretty clumsy.

86
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,010
I fall easily.

<i>I broke my wine glass while drinking.</i>

89
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,810
Change the date of her getting the stitches to 30th instead of 24th?

90
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,950
Yeah.

91
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,700
Fabricating medical record is illegal.

92
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,990
You think changing the medical record would do it?

93
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,890
If Oh Bong Sam thinks you're the suspect...

94
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:33,230
you won't get out of this easily.

95
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:36,690
Right. It would be just putting a band-aid on a wound.

98
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,510
Chairman.

99
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:06,860
I heard Detective Oh Bong Sam is asking Attorney Eulji about Director Ma's death.

100
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,370
I'll toss it over to the Chief Prosecutor.

101
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:12,030
Just let it be until she's on absolute edge.

102
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:17,390
The golden time is when you've got your neck snatched by the hunting dog.

103
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:19,850
Whether I'd rescue Eulji Hae Yi

104
00:07:19,850 --> 00:07:21,890
or throw her into a sewer.

105
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,800
Yes.

106
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:20,590
Oh, my! Oh! Big Unnie!

107
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,420
Unnie! Unnie! Unnie!

108
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:40,160
If you're so tormented like this, you can stop now.

109
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:43,080
Killing and dying. Paying back for what I got...

110
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:45,620
That's not the only way to take revenge.

111
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,900
Oh Bong Sam. What will you do about him?

112
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,440
Didn't you hate being in prison?

113
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,970
You want to go back there having finally escaped it after 34 years?

114
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,740
For murder?

115
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,830
Let's run out of the country.

116
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:13,090
I think that'd be good.

117
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,330
Right.

118
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,550
I think I should go.

119
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:27,790
Oh. Right. Thailand?

120
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,310
Canada? Australia? Where? Just say it.

121
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,880
Pack first?

122
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,470
Not decide on destination first?

123
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:40,360
True. Who cares how we go about it?

124
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,970
Geez...

125
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,390
You should pack up the safe first.

126
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,490
Huh?

127
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,000
You must love that feather thing.

128
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:54,570
<i>The Seongbukdong Madam wanted that one.</i>

129
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:57,730
<i>It's a limited edition with only 50 in existence.</i>

130
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:00,060
<i>This is the only one in the country.</i>

131
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:07,280
Don't you look fancy?

132
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,930
Hello, Madam.

133
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:14,950
It's rude to look fancier than the madam of the house.

134
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,240
It's pretty.

135
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,480
I'll accept it wholeheartedly.

136
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:39,780
My friend's daughter is getting married in the fall.

137
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,050
Thanks.

138
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,940
You were like this last time.

139
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:51,050
Did you fall for me, dear?

140
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,220
The Chairman...

141
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,750
loves you very much, huh?

142
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:02,620
Well, if you're a wife of a conglomerate owner,

143
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,530
everyone thinks you give up being a woman but live for money.

144
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,040
It's not true.

145
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,660
I live for love.

146
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:12,210
Dear.

147
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,090
The Chairman and I are still so passionate.

148
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,030
Excuse me for a moment.

149
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:25,510
Sure.

150
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,880
I'll take you to the powder foom.

151
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,500
No, it's okay.

152
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,600
I already know.

153
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:28,840
<i>Unnie, he's coming up right now.</i>

154
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,830
<i>Unnie, why don't you answer me?</i>

155
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:05,320
My lady, you're still so girly.

156
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,090
I'm having tea with Hae Yi.

157
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,430
Have a seat, Honey.

158
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,620
<i>Did you get caught?</i>

159
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,600
<i>Should I come in?</i>

160
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:17,270
- Attorney Eunji?
- Yeah, she's in the powder room.

161
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:20,200
It's not easy overstaying your welcome as a guest.

162
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,260
She's gutsy. I like her.

163
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,300
Chicago University...

164
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:12,190
Chicago University...

165
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:15,580
I heard Chicago is similar to here.

166
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,700

It must be so hot to study there.

Beef ramen for nutrition.

173
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,430
Okay.

174
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,450
Is that all?

175
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:40,350
Oh, gochujang! Parilla leaves and canned food.

176
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:42,980
Prepare everything and ship them to San.

177
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,950
You know the dorm address to Chicago University, right?

178
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:04,970
Unnie!

179
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,280
Attorney! I almost died.

180
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:11,910

People with a lot to lose make foolish decisions.

538
00:40:28,370 --> 00:40:31,440
Thanks for the genius hyung story...

539
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,960
but it's too heavy for a drinking story.

540
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:41,350
The investigation's over.

541
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:45,250
Don't bring up Director Ma again.

542
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,630
I want to help you.

543
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:51,830
You had your reasons and circumstances.

544
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:55,820
I'm not here to harass you, but to help you!

545
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,190
Does he have any evidence?

546
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:14,190
What did you talk about?

547
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:17,220
About his childhood neighborhood hyung.

548
00:42:03,050 --> 00:42:04,940
- Hey!
- Whoa!

549
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,260
Dr. Park, you're immature.

550
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:09,700
- Coffee?
- Had some already.

551
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:12,560
The blood test you requested.

552
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,190
What's ♪122?

553
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:16,320
That's what the vial's label said.

554
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:46,250
Attorney Bang, please come in.

555
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:47,960
Fighting!

556
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,900
Bang Sang Soo.

557
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,280
Chundang Gwangju Songjong.

558
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,190
4th group and an intern for the past 11 months.

559
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:08,930
Yes, correct.

560
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:13,230
You still live at Silimdong study dorms.

561
00:43:13,230 --> 00:43:15,000
Why don't you get a loan?

562
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:16,750
If you're an attorney intern,

563
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:19,600
you can easily pull up to 10 million won.

564
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,070
Why not do that and move?

565
00:43:21,070 --> 00:43:24,700
There's always a possibility of getting fired.

566
00:43:29,450 --> 00:43:33,740
I also lived at Silimdong hills area.

567
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,490
It seems that Attorney Eul's more distracted

568
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:44,880
after the Hyojadong case than before.

569
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,640
Jang Hwa Sa's re-trial?

570
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,590
She ignores us and is always

571
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:52,720
always only with Ms. Kam.

572
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,540
That's the reason she'd ignore us for.

573
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:57,300
Jang Hwa Sa.

574
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:01,620
- Bang Sang Soo.
- Yes?

575
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:03,270
Starting today...

576
00:44:04,370 --> 00:44:06,060
why don't you be my ringer finger?

577
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:07,450
What?

578
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:10,450
Director, I can't be your lover.

579
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:14,190
After I become a full time, I'll be married.

580
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:17,390
From a ring finger to a right arm...

581
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:19,190
then the shoulder.

582
00:44:20,970 --> 00:44:22,750
Am I being promoted to full-time?

583
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:25,530
You're very naive.

584
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:29,940
From now on, report everything to me.

585
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,580
Especially about Attorney Eulji...

586
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:38,210
even her personal life.

587
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:43,350
I'll be your personal security cam.

588
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,580
Is it my turn now?

589
00:44:55,580 --> 00:44:57,270
You're a special hire.

590
00:44:57,270 --> 00:44:58,660
Part-time.

591
00:45:03,170 --> 00:45:04,150
What happened?

592
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:08,810
I waited for two days and didn't see the Director.

593
00:45:08,810 --> 00:45:10,320
That's good.

594
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:12,470
There's no point in clashing.

595
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:18,430
Let's search entry records from 34 years ago.

596
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:21,060
Where can we find that? It's old.

597
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,730
According to Han unni,

598
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:26,120
the foreigner entry records start from 1961.

599
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:29,250
Search the entry records for Esther.

600
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,190
Esther.

601
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,060
Is it for certain?

602
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,400
It's not a common name.

603
00:45:36,410 --> 00:45:37,760
Esther.

604
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,440
A pregnant woman wouldn't have come alone.

605
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,360
I'm sure someone dropped her off.

606
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,900
Would you remember who?

607
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,670
Esther.

608
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:53,080
A pregnant woman wouldn't have come alone.

609
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,930
I'm sure someone dropped her off.

610
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:57,700
Would you remember who?

611
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:00,040
<i>[ December 24: If you have any info about "Esther" 
who died after giving birth, please contact me. ]</i>

612
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:01,810
<i>As if she was abandoned...</i>

613
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:05,480
<i>no one came to see her afterward.</i>

614
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,580
No one came to see the baby,

615
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:10,160
and no one came for the deceased lady.

616
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:13,780
I heard she became a "Jane Doe."

617
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,810
A "Jane Doe."

618
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:21,400
Then what about the baby?

619
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:28,280
The ALP is 287. 
<i>[ ALP: Alkaline Phosphatase ]</i>

620
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:32,570
The GGT is 115? 
<i>[ GGT: Gamma Glutamyl Transpeptidase ]</i>

621
00:46:32,570 --> 00:46:35,280
It's more than double the norm, right?

622
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:39,910
According the blood test, it's the big intestine or the gall.

623
00:46:39,910 --> 00:46:42,080
As a doctor, I'll recommend...

624
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,940
a thorough examination at the hospital.

625
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:48,820
Please help me.

626
00:46:48,820 --> 00:46:51,710
I gave you money and ran your blood test.

627
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:54,720
Regarding ♪122, speak to your warden.

628
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,610
- But Doctor...
- Instead of taking care of yourself,

629
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:59,810
why bother with ♪122?

630
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:04,120
This is important to me but...

631
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:07,430
others may find it insignificant.

632
00:47:07,430 --> 00:47:11,120
I owe Big Unnie my life.

633
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:13,350
You're a doctor.

634
00:47:13,350 --> 00:47:17,250
You can't discriminate patients.

635
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,060
If we had a needle, we could prick her finger.

636
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,220
Should we call the doctor?

637
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:33,040
That would be the quickest.

638
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:34,540
♪122!

639
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:45,760
It's an upset stomach. Not my first time.

640
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,340
I haven't eaten since breakfast.

641
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:52,410
It's a good thing. You can relax on a

642
00:47:52,410 --> 00:47:54,330
bed and everything.

643
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:57,200
And feel a man's touch.

644
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,450
Well, maybe not literally.

645
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:02,470
Okay. Let's lean back now.

646
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:10,470
Since you insist,

647
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,180
go right ahead!

648
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:16,300
Her ALP and GGT are extremely high.

649
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:22,570
Running her blood test was...

650
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:24,640
wrong in itself, don't you think?

651
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,860
Okay, we're rolling your shirt up.

652
00:48:29,860 --> 00:48:32,100
Let's start with the ultrasound.

653
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,840
- Put the gel on her.
- Okay.

654
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,520
No.

655
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,710
I won't do it.

656
00:48:37,710 --> 00:48:39,270
I won't.

657
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:43,940
You don't have to, if you don't want.

658
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:47,070
But...

659
00:48:48,140 --> 00:48:50,040
if I must...

660
00:48:51,050 --> 00:48:52,530
I'll ask Dr. So.

661
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:55,450
I want to as well, but...

662
00:48:55,450 --> 00:48:57,790
Do you want this or not?

663
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:00,050
Geez, Unnie.

664
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:02,170
Stop it and just lie down.

665
00:49:02,170 --> 00:49:04,370
Okay? Come on.

666
00:49:04,370 --> 00:49:06,340
Here, lie back.

667
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,660
- Take off her necklace and etc.
- Okay.

668
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:28,820
Breath in and...

669
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,740
hold it in.

670
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:39,480
Don't move or turn your head.

671
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:02,260
What's wrong with me?

672
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:05,570
Aside from diabetes.

673
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:08,000
This isn't my area of expertise.

674
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:12,400
So you must consent to few things.

675
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,150
Since you're in prison, you must

676
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:19,940
agree to not hold me responsible for these results.

677
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:23,690
You sound so cold.

678
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,290
You weren't like this before.

679
00:50:31,530 --> 00:50:34,080
Don't act like you know me.

680
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:55,570
Chan Sung,

681
00:50:55,570 --> 00:50:57,340
I'll get you a...

682
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:00,540
"not guilty" verdict for this trial.

683
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,790
After the verdict,

684
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:04,590
leave the country.

685
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:07,280
Why are you sending me away?

686
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,810
I'm on vacation but no where to go.

687
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:11,400
When you leave this time...

688
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:16,990
I want you to stay there for 10 to 15 years or so.

689
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,330
College, grad school and PhD...

690
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:24,040
then our New York Headquarters.

691
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:26,730
Checkmate!

692
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,890
Game over.

693
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:41,180
You haven't answered me yet.

694
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,900
Why do you want to send me away?

695
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:45,340
What's the reason?

696
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:47,130
So you can learn a lot...

697
00:51:47,130 --> 00:51:49,790
in a bigger world.

698
00:51:49,790 --> 00:51:54,470
I'll hold down the fort for 15 years.

699
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:56,730
For you, of course.

700
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,180
- You'll miss me too much.
- I'm sure I will.

701
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,330

702
00:52:07,330 --> 00:52:08,950
Yes?

703
00:52:08,950 --> 00:52:11,170
I love you.

704
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:20,050
Aigoo, seriously.

705
00:52:21,530 --> 00:52:24,130
Why all choked up?

706
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:25,950
Huh?

707
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,870
Chan Sung.

708
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:31,810
Well...

709
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:34,060
there's something...

710
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:37,960
I really want to protect is this world.

711
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,510
It's not my company, but...

712
00:52:41,510 --> 00:52:43,910
it's you, Chan Sung.

713
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,630
My son.

714
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:49,240
Aigoo, just don't get sick.

715
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:53,900
The blood test indicates that her ALP is 287 and GGT is 115.

716
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:57,250
There's an unidentified mass near the long intestine

717
00:52:57,250 --> 00:52:59,710
<i>[ Mass: A tumor ]</i> 
Her liver sugar rates are very high.

718
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,750
I don't think it's gallstone.

719
00:53:01,750 --> 00:53:03,730
She needs a CT in her stomach area.

720
00:53:03,730 --> 00:53:06,200
And let's check her CA19-9, too.

721
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:08,500
Did they get it fixed?

722
00:53:13,420 --> 00:53:15,450
Take off your uniform and come downstairs.

723
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:18,080
You're back on Team 3 now.

724
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:20,120
Seriously?

725
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,000
Wow, yeah! Yeah!

726
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,250
- Officer Oh!
- Welcome back.

727
00:53:28,250 --> 00:53:29,770
Thank you, thank you.

728
00:53:29,770 --> 00:53:32,790
- Hyung! - You punk! Fighting!
- Fighting!

729
00:53:32,790 --> 00:53:34,660
- Good seeing you.
- Welcome back.

730
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:38,260
- Happy to have you back.
- Thank you.

731
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,080
- Follow me.
- Good thing you're back.

732
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,120
- Hey, hey, I'll be back.
- Okay.

733
00:53:42,120 --> 00:53:44,490
- See you later!
- You should buy us dinner!

734
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:45,770
I'll get started.

735
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:50,950
You must have your reasons for continuing with the

736
00:53:50,950 --> 00:53:52,340
Ma Hyun Cheol case.

737
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,450
If it's nonsense, I'll kill you.

738
00:53:54,450 --> 00:53:57,230
Of course, Hyungnim. It's it's nonsense, please kill me.

739
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:00,310
This is a day before the incident, at 6:02 p.m.

740
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,360
That's Ma Hyun Cheol and...

741
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,650
Please go in, Doctor.

742
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:52,070
Please excuse me.

743
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,150
<i>It's too simple. Do I look materialistic?</i>

744
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:32,350

745
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:35,930

746
00:55:35,930 --> 00:55:37,280
<i>Oops, I'm sorry.</i>

747
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,970
<i>I didn't know it was her.</i>

748
00:55:40,260 --> 00:55:42,560
<i>We can engrave them.</i>

749
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:45,480
<i>I was thinking of "Veritas."</i>

750
00:55:47,630 --> 00:55:51,130
<i>It's not a common faith.</i>

751
00:55:51,130 --> 00:55:56,280
<i>It's an absolute and unshakable faith.</i>

752
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:07,690
<i>"Veritas" is...</i>

753
00:56:07,690 --> 00:56:10,540

Hae Yi?
