00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:37,490
One traditional tea, please.

3
00:00:38,298 --> 00:00:42,250
- Wow.
- Nice...

4
00:00:51,183 --> 00:00:53,144
A contraceptive bandage for men, please.

5
00:00:54,308 --> 00:00:56,347
That will be 200 won.

6
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,367
Not this, I need one for men.

7
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:02,871
I don't think they specify the gender.

8
00:01:02,871 --> 00:01:06,436
Come on, she's asking for condoms.

9
00:01:06,846 --> 00:01:11,740
The young lady must be getting ready
for a hot and historical Christmas Eve.

10
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,147
You know this is sexual harassment?

11
00:01:15,147 --> 00:01:16,980
Give me 30 pills of Seconal.

12
00:01:18,674 --> 00:01:21,650
Seconal? Sedatives?

13
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:23,578
What's wrong with you?

14
00:01:23,578 --> 00:01:25,760
You didn't get a prescription from her.

15
00:01:25,784 --> 00:01:28,000
Selling prescription drugs
without a prescription

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,358
will get you up to 1 year in prison
or 10 million won in fines...

17
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:32,200
You just...

18
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:35,233
worry about your
"hot and historical Christmas Eve."

19
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,516
What did she say?

20
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:53,610
Seriously...

21
00:01:56,263 --> 00:01:57,913
Where is he?

22
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:02,433
Damn it.

23
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:04,104
Damn...

24
00:02:04,104 --> 00:02:07,313
Why is he making me
come to Namsan on Christmas?

25
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,367
Yoo Jin.

26
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,560
Open the door, I'm cold.

27
00:02:43,362 --> 00:02:45,564
Yoo Jin, open the door.

28
00:02:53,562 --> 00:02:55,050
Yoo Jin!

29
00:02:56,158 --> 00:02:57,260
Yoo Jin!

30
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:05,174
Yoo Jin!

31
00:03:05,436 --> 00:03:07,582
Open the door, Yoo Jin!

32
00:03:20,092 --> 00:03:22,127
What have you done to him?

33
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,306
Yoo Jin!

34
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,074
Yoo Jin, open the door!

00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:30,885

<i>[My Perfect Man]</i>

38
00:03:58,021 --> 00:04:00,157
I can't go down like this...

39
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,872
- Hello?
<i>- Happy birthday to you.</i>

40
00:04:05,872 --> 00:04:07,122
What's wrong with your voice?

41
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:11,699
I had a dream that you died.

42
00:04:11,699 --> 00:04:14,264
Why would I die before you?

43
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:16,490
After all, I'm three years
younger than you.

44
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:19,759
- Oh my gosh!
- Happy birthday to you!

45
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,331
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

46
00:04:22,331 --> 00:04:24,533
- No...
- What's going on?

47
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:28,064
- What's all the ruckus?
- No, they're singing me happy birthday.

48
00:04:28,809 --> 00:04:31,492
I guess your fan club prepared
something special for you.

49
00:04:31,492 --> 00:04:33,422
<i>Happy birthday to you!</i>

50
00:04:34,982 --> 00:04:37,021
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday.

51
00:04:37,021 --> 00:04:38,495
Thank you!

52
00:04:41,742 --> 00:04:45,065
<i>I like that...
You're getting jealous.</i>

53
00:04:45,065 --> 00:04:46,774
Happy birthday!

54
00:04:46,774 --> 00:04:49,545
Isn't it a good thing if you dream
about someone dying?

55
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:52,300
<i>Maybe I should play the lottery.</i>

56
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:55,798
- What are you doing?
- They're all here, Attorney Eulji.

57
00:04:56,357 --> 00:04:59,201
I need to go. I'll see you tonight.

58
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:37,262
- What do you think of this?
- I like it.

59
00:05:44,706 --> 00:05:47,882
- I put in ice for you.
- Goodbye.

<i>[Episode 1]</i>

61
00:06:26,346 --> 00:06:29,112
Wow, so pretty.

62
00:06:29,112 --> 00:06:31,899
She was very pretty when she was young.

63
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:33,682
I guess you like that type.

64
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:36,713
Do you think Ms. Jang Hwa Sa's
sentence will be reduced?

65
00:06:36,713 --> 00:06:39,000
The committee will decide that.

66
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,309
I think her sentence was too harsh.

67
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:43,475
Even homicide gets only 17 years.

68
00:06:43,475 --> 00:06:45,416
Even if it was back in 1984

69
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,569
- a death sentence for a first offense?
- Stop complaining.

70
00:06:47,569 --> 00:06:51,410
Our seniors gave a fair verdict
after going over it with heavy hearts.

71
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:54,185
Come on, that's such a textbook answer.

72
00:06:54,185 --> 00:06:56,663
If you don't like textbooks,
you shouldn't have gone into law.

73
00:06:56,663 --> 00:06:59,389
The law is a textbook
of agreed-upon rules.

74
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:11,105
<i>They say dreams are signals
from the subconscious.</i>

75
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,029
Here we go...

76
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:17,322
<i>Something you can't notice
when you're rationally thinking.</i>

77
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,622
<i>A signal from the realm of intuition.</i>

78
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,843
All done.

79
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:26,829
Here...

80
00:07:26,829 --> 00:07:28,245
<i>When I think back to it...</i>

81
00:07:28,245 --> 00:07:32,468
<i>my subconsciousness
was ringing a noisy bell.</i>

82
00:07:34,019 --> 00:07:38,423
<i>But I ignored that signal.</i>

83
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:40,759
<i>The world I lived in</i>

84
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:44,408
<i>was a realm of reason where
rational judgment was possible.</i>

85
00:07:44,408 --> 00:07:50,997
<i>Not a world of intuition that
could not be predicted or ruled out.</i>

86
00:07:53,149 --> 00:07:55,812
<i>I should never have met Jang Hwa Sa.</i>

87
00:07:58,007 --> 00:07:59,699
<i>I should have...</i>

88
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,199
<i>listened to the signals
from my subconscious.</i>

89
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,668
Ms. Jang Hwa Sa?

90
00:08:19,668 --> 00:08:22,274
Yes, that's me.

91
00:08:22,274 --> 00:08:23,619
Please have a seat.

92
00:08:33,505 --> 00:08:36,402
You have excellent scores
from your correction officer.

93
00:08:36,402 --> 00:08:38,423
I guess you've been reformed.

94
00:08:38,423 --> 00:08:41,147
Or maybe you were behaving
to get your sentence reduced.

95
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:48,500
May I ask how old you are?

96
00:08:50,244 --> 00:08:52,184
I'm 36.

97
00:08:52,184 --> 00:08:58,004
This will be my 34th year in prison.

98
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,033
We all know that fact already.

99
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:06,982
They say people on death row
die five times.

100
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:09,917
Once when they receive their sentence.

101
00:09:09,917 --> 00:09:12,836
Again when their sentence
enforcement is given.

102
00:09:15,548 --> 00:09:23,210
Again on the morning of execution when
they take you to get your physical exam.

103
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,674
And on their last walk
into the execution room.

104
00:09:27,674 --> 00:09:30,885
Finally, when the noose
is placed around their neck.

105
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:36,447
But, Miss...

106
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,926
I don't believe that's true.

107
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,630
I feel like...

108
00:09:44,899 --> 00:09:48,980
I die every morning when the sun rises.

109
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,293
Is today the day?

110
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:56,279
Is today the day they'll
put the noose around my neck?

111
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:05,807
If you won't reduce my sentence...

112
00:10:08,498 --> 00:10:11,058
please just kill me now.

113
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:16,956
Ms. Jang Hwa Sa.

114
00:10:16,956 --> 00:10:19,000
You're being very extreme.

115
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,697
Please calm yourself down.

116
00:10:21,865 --> 00:10:28,883
We may give up on hope,
but hope doesn't give up on us.

117
00:10:33,544 --> 00:10:36,447
If you're not here to give me hope...

118
00:10:37,897 --> 00:10:42,985
I really want you to just kill me.

119
00:10:49,951 --> 00:10:51,770
<i>She has diabetes.</i>

120
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,277
And her mother is in
a nursing home for dementia.

121
00:10:54,277 --> 00:10:58,259
Let's reduce her sentence, and prepare
her to be released back into society.

122
00:10:58,259 --> 00:11:00,852
There is one thing
that's been bothering me.

123
00:11:01,648 --> 00:11:04,922
Even if the original sentence
was a bit harsh

124
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:08,914
I wonder if it's the right thing
to reverse my seniors' decisions.

125
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:14,182
The fact that the execution
hadn't happened in the last 34 years

126
00:11:14,182 --> 00:11:18,600
is a sign from the heavens that we
should release Ms. Jang Hwa Sa, no?

127
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,653
<i>A sign from the heavens, my ass.</i>

128
00:11:20,653 --> 00:11:22,431
<i>You emotional fool...</i>

129
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,496
We should go eat now.

130
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:27,456
Looks like we have a consensus.
Should we finalize it?

131
00:11:27,456 --> 00:11:29,441
- Yeah, let's do that.
- Yes.

132
00:11:30,236 --> 00:11:31,825
This way.

133
00:11:39,802 --> 00:11:41,784
<i>Kim Joo Hyuk, president of
Lawyers for a Democratic Society.</i>

134
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,948
Lee Sun Hee, Minister of
Gender Equality and Family.

135
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:47,369
Hwang Ki Kap, human rights attorney.

136
00:11:47,369 --> 00:11:49,856
You know the rest, right?

137
00:11:50,841 --> 00:11:53,905
It's so red. Completely red.

138
00:11:53,905 --> 00:11:55,865
How do you even get colors that red?

139
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:58,298
The top two are
Professor Kang's colleagues.

140
00:11:58,298 --> 00:12:01,787
The bottom two, his juniors.
All members of Amnesty International.

141
00:12:02,384 --> 00:12:04,836
They're all in on this together.

142
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:09,212
Professor Kang has been
preparing for this

143
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:11,053
to release Jang Hwa Sa.

144
00:12:11,053 --> 00:12:13,818
He's looking for their approval.

145
00:12:13,818 --> 00:12:17,883
That's three votes. What do we do?

146
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:21,600
Pick two. Which ones do I need to stab?

147
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,768
Even if you want to stab them,
they won't get stabbed.

148
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:27,284
- Send me.
- What?

149
00:12:28,339 --> 00:12:30,803
You're not eligible.

150
00:12:30,803 --> 00:12:33,774
You don't have the profile
to sit in one place with them.

151
00:12:33,774 --> 00:12:36,304
- Bring it in.
- Yes, Attorney.

152
00:12:42,413 --> 00:12:44,370
What's that?

153
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:54,547
Senior partner?

154
00:12:55,321 --> 00:12:56,568
Are you crazy?

155
00:12:56,568 --> 00:12:58,153
You've only been here 10 years!

156
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:02,120
You think Korea's best law firm,
Damjang, is a joke?

157
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,200
And you're a woman at that!

158
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,399
In return...

159
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,361
I'll tie down Jang Hwa Sa
forever at Cheongwon.

160
00:13:11,581 --> 00:13:13,975
That's what Chairman Gi San wants.

161
00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:27,888
So...

162
00:13:27,888 --> 00:13:30,162
So how badly did she get hurt?

163
00:13:30,162 --> 00:13:32,735
Inmate 3457, your call is over.

164
00:13:32,735 --> 00:13:34,523
Inmate 112, get ready for your call.

165
00:13:36,917 --> 00:13:38,802
What are you doing, 3457?

166
00:13:38,802 --> 00:13:41,984
Just one more call.
My daughter was hurt.

167
00:13:41,984 --> 00:13:44,634
- I want to know how she's doing...
- This is no place to be a mother.

168
00:13:44,634 --> 00:13:45,736
Come out.

169
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:47,438
Come on.

170
00:14:00,392 --> 00:14:03,711
<i>What took you so long to call?</i>

171
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,163
<i>Can you see Mom?</i>

172
00:14:08,163 --> 00:14:10,068
<i>You see her?</i>

173
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:12,884
Yeah.

174
00:14:12,884 --> 00:14:14,644
<i>What's tight?</i>

175
00:14:14,644 --> 00:14:15,812
Over here?

176
00:14:15,812 --> 00:14:17,225
Here?

177
00:14:17,633 --> 00:14:20,894
- I changed her.
- Tight, tight, tight...

178
00:14:20,894 --> 00:14:22,440
It's so loose on you.

179
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,609
It's a song she used to sing to cheer
on her team when she was in school.

180
00:14:25,609 --> 00:14:27,009
<i>Tight, tight, tight...</i>

181
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:29,139
You can cheer her on later.

182
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:33,243
<i>You should talk to her, it's not
every day you get to talk to her.</i>

183
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,339
<i>How are you, Miss?</i>

184
00:14:42,235 --> 00:14:45,256
Mom, you look so pretty today too.

185
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:48,971
"How are you, Miss?"
She's your daughter.

186
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,000
It's your daughter, Jang Hwa Sa.
Hwa Sa!

187
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,976
What?

188
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,248
Oh my goodness, I had a child?

189
00:14:57,248 --> 00:14:58,572
Oh, no...

190
00:14:58,572 --> 00:15:01,148
<i>This is the first I'm hearing about it.</i>

191
00:15:01,148 --> 00:15:02,702
<i>Phone call over.</i>

192
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,413
Wait, Officer.

193
00:15:32,109 --> 00:15:36,248
Why... did you stop me?

194
00:15:38,293 --> 00:15:42,615
Do you have good news?

195
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:47,346
I don't quite agree with you.

196
00:15:47,932 --> 00:15:48,932
What?

197
00:15:48,932 --> 00:15:53,446
Even if you return to society now,
your life won't change much.

198
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:55,600
How will you live out there?

199
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:58,993
You'll go around
collecting trash with that leg?

200
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:04,702
At least they give you a bed
to sleep in and food to eat here.

201
00:16:04,702 --> 00:16:07,311
It's not the best, but they
give you medical treatment.

202
00:16:07,311 --> 00:16:09,995
I heard you have severe diabetes.

203
00:16:09,995 --> 00:16:12,669
How will you pay for your
medical fees if you leave here?

204
00:16:12,669 --> 00:16:15,296
Our nation's medical fees
aren't cheap at all.

205
00:16:15,296 --> 00:16:17,886
You'll end up returning here.

206
00:16:17,886 --> 00:16:21,350
Even if you don't,
you'll just end up becoming homeless.

207
00:16:23,369 --> 00:16:26,476
Just stay here.

208
00:16:26,476 --> 00:16:29,052
Tell the warden you don't want
a reduction in your sentence.

209
00:16:29,052 --> 00:16:30,510
I have...

210
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:36,996
a mother nearing her 90s,
who lives in a nursing home.

211
00:16:40,441 --> 00:16:44,000
I want to cook her favorite noodles.

212
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,176
And I want to bathe her.

213
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:55,488
And I want to be there
when she passes away.

214
00:16:57,823 --> 00:17:04,040
If I can do that, I don't care if
I become homeless or terminally ill.

215
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:07,090
Please...

216
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:09,310
Please help me.

217
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,863
Please.

218
00:17:15,323 --> 00:17:17,288
She wouldn't know anyway.

219
00:17:20,151 --> 00:17:21,673
She has dementia.

220
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:26,256
Whether you cook
her favorite noodles or bathe her...

221
00:17:26,256 --> 00:17:29,194
She wouldn't recognize
her daughter anyway.

222
00:17:31,037 --> 00:17:35,707
Don't you think it's a blessing
that your mother has dementia?

223
00:17:45,175 --> 00:17:49,750
Your mother got sick because of you.

224
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,564
That's how you get dementia.

225
00:17:53,564 --> 00:17:55,646
Extreme stress.

226
00:17:55,646 --> 00:17:57,700
Her daughter is on death row.

227
00:17:57,700 --> 00:18:01,750
How could she live in sanity
if she remembered everything?

228
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:09,743
Yeah, I'm that bizarre and evil woman,
Jang Hwa Sa.

229
00:18:09,743 --> 00:18:13,799
I'm that bitch who caused my
mom to get dementia!

230
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:17,144
You call yourself an attorney?

231
00:18:17,144 --> 00:18:18,387
Officer!

232
00:18:18,387 --> 00:18:19,548
Help!

233
00:18:22,141 --> 00:18:24,819
- Help!
- Die!

234
00:18:24,819 --> 00:18:26,834
Die!

235
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:32,150
Die!

236
00:18:33,693 --> 00:18:37,520
Die!
Die!

237
00:18:38,230 --> 00:18:39,621
Die!

238
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,751
- Hae Yi!
- I'll kill that bitch!

239
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:18,409
That's so weird.

240
00:19:18,984 --> 00:19:22,773
If she had behaved, she would
have gotten her sentence reduced.

241
00:19:22,773 --> 00:19:26,076
Why did she do that to you?

242
00:19:26,503 --> 00:19:29,739
A predictable and happy ending is no fun.

243
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:55,287
What happened?

244
00:19:55,287 --> 00:19:56,301
<i>Cleared.</i>

245
00:19:56,301 --> 00:19:58,123
<i>It's our victory, five to zero.</i>

246
00:20:02,064 --> 00:20:05,106
I knew it. Good job, Attorney Eulji.

247
00:20:05,106 --> 00:20:07,804
Yes, I worked really hard today.

248
00:20:07,804 --> 00:20:11,869
Make sure you tell Chairman Gi San that
Eulji Hae Yi worked extra hard for him.

249
00:20:14,365 --> 00:20:17,332
That young attorney is very talented.

250
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,647
I'm good at picking out mercenaries.

251
00:20:32,361 --> 00:20:34,450
I don't know if I should ask you this...

252
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,618
As for Ms. Jang Hwa Sa's outrage today,
did you by any chance...

253
00:20:40,618 --> 00:20:42,951
How many interns came in
with you last year?

254
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:47,874
- I think 41?
- You know only 8 will remain, right?

255
00:20:48,471 --> 00:20:51,962
You lack detail and sensibility.

256
00:20:51,962 --> 00:20:55,445
You don't have the looks
that the judges like, either.

257
00:20:55,445 --> 00:20:57,818
It won't be easy for you
to survive at our firm.

258
00:20:57,818 --> 00:20:59,567
I guarantee that.

259
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:15,538
I won't be able to keep my promise
this time either, Mom.

260
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:22,134
I'm sorry, Mom.

261
00:21:42,251 --> 00:21:46,688
Your glucose levels are good,
and your blood pressure is very good too.

262
00:21:46,688 --> 00:21:48,326
It's perfect.

263
00:21:48,326 --> 00:21:50,564
So why am I in so much pain?

264
00:21:50,564 --> 00:21:53,366
It throbs everywhere.

265
00:21:53,366 --> 00:21:57,916
They say, the hearts of Koreans
are -14 degrees.

266
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:01,674
If you recognize that other people
are struggling just as much as you

267
00:22:01,674 --> 00:22:04,363
your heart will be at ease.

268
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:08,500
But it hurts...

269
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,750
<i>[New message from My Goddess]</i>

270
00:22:33,053 --> 00:22:36,000
Come on, what took you so long?

271
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:41,834
I was getting all nervous that I would
have to party alone with your boyfriend.

272
00:22:41,834 --> 00:22:44,392
- Everything's finished?
- Fantastic, no?

273
00:22:44,392 --> 00:22:45,503
Nice.

274
00:22:48,157 --> 00:22:50,776
Oh my goodness,
what are you doing?

275
00:22:50,776 --> 00:22:52,644
Décor is the best part!

276
00:22:52,644 --> 00:22:54,717
You want me to tell the world
that I hired a chef?

277
00:22:54,717 --> 00:22:57,211
Come on, leave.
I'll take care of the rest.

278
00:22:57,798 --> 00:23:01,442
- I have time.
- You brought all this?

279
00:23:01,442 --> 00:23:02,657
Yes.

280
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:06,546
My goodness, can you handle
my babies with care?

281
00:23:06,546 --> 00:23:10,723
Oh, no...
I wanted to do this for you.

282
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,978
You didn't charge me for the case
involving my building in Itaewon.

283
00:23:12,978 --> 00:23:14,922
Okay, then. Use the stairs.

284
00:23:14,922 --> 00:23:17,635
Don't use the elevator. Bye.

285
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:23,911
Gosh, she's so pretty, but so stuck up.

286
00:23:24,497 --> 00:23:26,596
Stairs?

287
00:23:43,597 --> 00:23:46,721
Isn't Gi Yoo Jin supposed
to prepare these things?

288
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:50,196
Who cares who bought it? What matters
is that they're couple rings.

289
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:02,200
It's open, come in.

290
00:24:04,683 --> 00:24:06,536
Why didn't you open the door?

291
00:24:06,902 --> 00:24:08,124
Huh?

292
00:24:09,972 --> 00:24:11,489
Oh...

293
00:24:11,699 --> 00:24:13,493
Bravo!

294
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:15,496
This is nothing.

295
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:20,143
<i>Does her boyfriend know
how stuck up she is?</i>

296
00:24:20,143 --> 00:24:22,258
"Use the stairs"?

297
00:24:22,258 --> 00:24:25,009
After all the cooking
I did for her...

298
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:31,519
Oh my goodness...

299
00:24:31,775 --> 00:24:32,961
Oh my...

300
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,296
That scared me!

301
00:24:35,756 --> 00:24:40,925
Why are you using the stairs
when there's an elevator?

302
00:24:41,133 --> 00:24:43,470
Are you working out?

303
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:46,673
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

304
00:24:48,234 --> 00:24:49,652
Here.

305
00:24:54,348 --> 00:24:55,417
Here.

306
00:24:56,445 --> 00:24:59,787
Let's start with the steak.
We can have the dessert later.

307
00:25:00,164 --> 00:25:02,041
Okay, let's eat.

308
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:07,834
You made all this?

309
00:25:07,834 --> 00:25:08,887
Really?

310
00:25:08,887 --> 00:25:12,415
You can't even have your mother's
seaweed soup, this is the least I can do.

311
00:25:12,415 --> 00:25:14,446
I'm so touched.

312
00:25:15,373 --> 00:25:17,150
How did it go at Cheongwon?

313
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:19,528
Did my death in your dream
bring you luck?

314
00:25:19,528 --> 00:25:22,246
It's me you're talking to.
I win all my cases.

315
00:25:22,246 --> 00:25:25,191
- I'll be a senior partner soon.
- Oh...

316
00:25:31,181 --> 00:25:33,316
- What's the number?
- What?

317
00:25:33,316 --> 00:25:35,307
We have a team dinner next week.

318
00:25:35,307 --> 00:25:38,050
I'll make a reservation with this chef.
Give me the number.

319
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,873
What are you talking about?
I made everything myself.

320
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:45,944
I know, you cooked the steak
that the chef marinated.

321
00:25:45,944 --> 00:25:48,189
I saw it before.

322
00:25:49,647 --> 00:25:51,426
Very good.

323
00:25:52,276 --> 00:25:53,851
You have no manners.

324
00:25:53,851 --> 00:25:55,336
You're mad?

325
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:56,903
I'm playing with you.

326
00:25:57,917 --> 00:25:59,647
Hae Yi.

327
00:26:00,352 --> 00:26:02,529
Fine, his name is Hong Seok Cheon.

328
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:04,830
- Happy?
- You're really mad?

329
00:26:06,544 --> 00:26:13,156
You're going to stay mad?
I prepared a huge present for you.

330
00:26:13,156 --> 00:26:14,490
What is it?

331
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,568
I'll give it my all for you tonight.

332
00:26:26,007 --> 00:26:28,622
What? It's my birthday today.

333
00:26:28,622 --> 00:26:29,979
Come on.

334
00:26:40,202 --> 00:26:42,310
- Were you expecting someone?
- No.

335
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,152
It was getting nice and hot...

336
00:27:02,895 --> 00:27:05,584
There's no address or sender information.

337
00:27:05,584 --> 00:27:07,855
There are a lot
of crazy people out there.

338
00:27:07,855 --> 00:27:10,042
I often get packages
like that during a lawsuit.

339
00:27:10,555 --> 00:27:12,773
- Should I call the bomb squad?
- No.

340
00:27:12,773 --> 00:27:15,550
I haven't taken on any lawsuits
that I would get bombed for.

341
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,382
- Then you open it.
- Come on.

342
00:27:18,382 --> 00:27:20,186
Fine.

343
00:27:30,009 --> 00:27:33,863
Oh, it's an antique.
Let's open it.

344
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,163
<i>[Bizarre and Evil Woman,
Jang Hwa Sa, Kills Her Boyfriend]</i>

345
00:27:46,163 --> 00:27:49,221
- Who would send this?
- I think this was sent to me.

346
00:27:50,567 --> 00:27:51,929
What?

347
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:53,541
Why do you think that?

348
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:56,585
Look.

349
00:27:56,585 --> 00:27:58,761
Gi Yoo Jin.

350
00:27:59,359 --> 00:28:02,460
I engraved this on my dad's pill box
when I was young.

351
00:28:07,596 --> 00:28:09,648
Who is Jang Hwa Sa?

352
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:13,782
Why are you being like this?

353
00:28:13,782 --> 00:28:16,186
Cheongwon.
Sentence reduction committee.

354
00:28:16,809 --> 00:28:19,288
- Right?
- No.

355
00:28:19,288 --> 00:28:21,549
I know I'm right.
You want me to prove it?

356
00:28:21,549 --> 00:28:23,497
That's the wrong question to ask.

357
00:28:23,497 --> 00:28:26,050
You shouldn't be asking me
about Jang Hwa Sa.

358
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:29,740
You should be about him.
Choo Young Bae.

359
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:31,989
Choo Young Bae?

360
00:28:33,009 --> 00:28:35,000
Who's he?

361
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,755
What does he have to do with me?

362
00:28:37,364 --> 00:28:39,453
He's your half-brother.

363
00:28:39,453 --> 00:28:41,855
Half... half-brother?

364
00:28:42,578 --> 00:28:44,267
Him?

365
00:28:44,267 --> 00:28:45,358
Really?

366
00:28:45,358 --> 00:28:48,288
If you want to know more,
go ask Chairman Gi San.

367
00:28:48,288 --> 00:28:50,294
That's all I know.

368
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:53,057
I'll go bring the cake.
We need to continue the party.

369
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,971
You call yourself an attorney?

370
00:29:11,971 --> 00:29:14,777
I engraved this on my dad's pill box
when I was young.

371
00:29:14,777 --> 00:29:16,739
What's going on?

372
00:29:17,809 --> 00:29:20,134
Who sent that box?

373
00:29:28,158 --> 00:29:33,158
<font color="#0080ff">[DramaFever Ver]</font>
<font color="#ff80ff">tvN E01 'Room No.9'</font>
<font color="#8080ff">-♥ Ruo Xi ♥-</font>

374
00:29:41,262 --> 00:29:42,434
Damn it.

375
00:29:42,434 --> 00:29:43,971
It's all ruined.

376
00:29:43,971 --> 00:29:46,454
Jang Hwa Sa ruined everything!

377
00:29:54,934 --> 00:29:58,011
Dad, you were so healthy.

378
00:29:58,011 --> 00:29:59,134
Choo Young Bae.

379
00:29:59,134 --> 00:30:00,180
Me.

380
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,105
How many kids did he have
out of wedlock?

381
00:30:06,335 --> 00:30:08,354
Jang Hwa Sa.

382
00:30:09,987 --> 00:30:16,090
What's the relationship...
between me and this woman?

383
00:30:19,703 --> 00:30:21,825
You said you would tell me.

384
00:30:22,691 --> 00:30:24,420
Who is my mother?

385
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,623
Who is my mother, Dad?

386
00:30:26,623 --> 00:30:28,432
Tell me.

387
00:30:28,432 --> 00:30:30,573
Come on, tell me.

388
00:30:30,573 --> 00:30:32,307
Tell me.

389
00:30:38,344 --> 00:30:40,701
It can't be...

390
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,263
Congrats!

391
00:30:48,886 --> 00:30:50,659
Congratulations.

392
00:30:50,659 --> 00:30:53,065
Pass them down.

393
00:30:53,065 --> 00:30:56,203
- This is nice...
- Let's drink up!

394
00:30:56,210 --> 00:30:59,718
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

395
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:06,089
Good job.

396
00:31:06,089 --> 00:31:08,436
I'm sure it wasn't easy
with Jang Hwa Sa.

397
00:31:08,436 --> 00:31:12,105
Don't tell me this is it.

398
00:31:12,806 --> 00:31:18,888
I may be the CEO, but it's not easy
making you a senior partner.

399
00:31:18,888 --> 00:31:22,073
I need to listen to Chairman Gi San.

400
00:31:22,073 --> 00:31:24,394
And the other partners' opinions, too.

401
00:31:24,394 --> 00:31:26,385
Sir.

402
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:29,432
You wanted to kill Jang Hwa Sa too.

403
00:31:29,432 --> 00:31:32,553
For your dad, no?

404
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,015
I guess you never forget about scandals.

405
00:31:38,015 --> 00:31:42,423
When you think of my dad,
you automatically think of Jang Hwa Sa?

406
00:31:42,423 --> 00:31:45,457
But I won't settle for something small.

407
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:49,071
I'll get compensated for
what I did with Jang Hwa Sa.

408
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:53,998
I will make senior partner
at the upcoming general assembly.

409
00:31:55,594 --> 00:31:58,454
Come on...

410
00:31:59,782 --> 00:32:03,861
Sir, they're asking you to move your car.

411
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,160
This is the problem with Gangbuk.

412
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,721
They don't even have valet parking
at a famous place like this.

413
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:12,210
Give me the key,
I'll pull it out for you.

414
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:18,432
I'll do it... I'll...

415
00:32:19,953 --> 00:32:22,954
I said I would do it,
why did you come out?

416
00:32:22,954 --> 00:32:24,941
If you don't want to do this,
come down to the station.

417
00:32:24,941 --> 00:32:27,730
You can go there
and draw blood like a real man.

418
00:32:28,428 --> 00:32:30,722
Should I just blow into it
like a real man?

419
00:32:30,722 --> 00:32:31,987
Sounds good.

420
00:32:31,987 --> 00:32:33,335
Here.

421
00:32:38,262 --> 00:32:42,076
Wow, 0.078.

422
00:32:42,076 --> 00:32:44,311
I see you started your party quite early.

423
00:32:44,311 --> 00:32:46,423
You've got some guts.

424
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,351
Right in front of a police car.

425
00:32:49,396 --> 00:32:51,430
We haven't moved yet.

426
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,652
To be exact, he hasn't
started driving yet.

427
00:32:53,652 --> 00:32:54,699
Oh, yes...

428
00:32:54,699 --> 00:32:57,949
What's this smoke coming
out of the rear?

429
00:32:57,949 --> 00:32:59,704
Don't you hear it making
the rattling noise?

430
00:32:59,704 --> 00:33:01,351
This proves he was driving.

431
00:33:01,351 --> 00:33:03,135
Attorney Eulji Hae Yi.

432
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,161
You know me?

433
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:15,040
Oh...

434
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,532
Officer Oh Bong Sam from the homicide
department at Jo Eun Police Station.

435
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:24,065
Oh Bong Sam?

436
00:33:27,666 --> 00:33:29,767
Come here, you call this a trial?

437
00:33:29,767 --> 00:33:30,934
This is nothing but nonsense.

438
00:33:30,934 --> 00:33:32,276
You won't admit to it?

439
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,090
Let go!
Let go of him!

440
00:33:35,310 --> 00:33:37,063
Are you okay?

441
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,926
Oh...

442
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,946
Oh...
Yes, it's me.

443
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:55,248
I'm that Oh Bong Sam who was
in charge of Ki Chang Sung's case.

444
00:33:55,248 --> 00:33:57,916
An officer from the homicide department
pulls over cars for DUls?

445
00:33:57,916 --> 00:34:00,039
You should watch what you say.

446
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:04,206
Thanks to you, I was demoted
to a traffic officer.

447
00:34:04,206 --> 00:34:07,585
I've been eating and resting in comfort.
It's been very nice.

448
00:34:08,275 --> 00:34:12,135
Don't worry, 0.078 is only
a one-month license suspension.

449
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:15,186
You can use the company car,
and they'll take care of your fines.

450
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:19,347
That's great, you are the best!

451
00:34:19,347 --> 00:34:21,913
We've got great benefits
at our firm.

452
00:34:21,913 --> 00:34:23,967
Ms. Eulji Hae Yi.

453
00:34:24,614 --> 00:34:29,333
I'm ticketing you for
accompanying a drunk driver.

454
00:34:34,014 --> 00:34:36,532
Jang Hwa Sa?

455
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,012
Why do I have to take on her case?

456
00:34:38,012 --> 00:34:41,431
You need to request a retrial since
her sentence reduction was revoked.

457
00:34:41,431 --> 00:34:43,951
That has nothing to do with me.

458
00:34:43,951 --> 00:34:46,407
That woman's so violent,
she's got a problem!

459
00:34:46,407 --> 00:34:47,936
I didn't say anything.

460
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:50,862
She's innocent, so you'll have
no trouble getting a retrial.

461
00:34:50,862 --> 00:34:52,786
You must be mistaken.

462
00:34:52,786 --> 00:34:55,882
I'm here just to fulfill
my 30 hours of volunteer work.

463
00:34:55,882 --> 00:34:58,398
So fulfill your hours with this.

464
00:34:58,398 --> 00:35:01,666
Jang Hwa Sa's mother spent 10 years
running from police station

465
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:04,518
to prosecutors, to courts,
writing all this and making copies.

466
00:35:04,518 --> 00:35:06,722
This is the compilation
of all those files.

467
00:35:09,309 --> 00:35:11,048
How...

468
00:35:12,804 --> 00:35:15,226
How can you pair me with Jang Hwa Sa?

469
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:18,784
I have this feeling
about Ms. Jang Hwa Sa...

470
00:35:18,784 --> 00:35:24,967
that she not only had special connections
to your dad, but to you as well.

471
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:32,119
Feelings are only cognitive errors
stemming from selective abstraction.

472
00:35:33,199 --> 00:35:35,429
Do you remember the first class?

473
00:35:35,429 --> 00:35:38,452
"No matter what the case,
do not be prejudiced."

474
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:42,097
"No matter who the client is,
do not refuse them."

475
00:35:42,097 --> 00:35:44,795
Don't be prejudiced
and don't refuse anyone?

476
00:35:44,795 --> 00:35:47,246
That's so boring.

477
00:35:48,795 --> 00:35:51,818
And stop saying those boring things
to the law school students.

478
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,643
Jang Hwa Sa's retrial?

479
00:35:58,686 --> 00:36:01,445
What's this nonsense?

480
00:36:01,445 --> 00:36:03,456
It's better this way.

481
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,856
It's not likely, but there is
the possibility of an appeal.

482
00:36:06,856 --> 00:36:09,663
I'll end it with my own hands

483
00:36:09,663 --> 00:36:12,347
so please proceed with
making me a senior partner.

484
00:36:15,449 --> 00:36:16,858
Go.

485
00:36:16,858 --> 00:36:18,976
Oh, no...

486
00:36:22,451 --> 00:36:24,262
Yeah, what is it?

487
00:36:26,297 --> 00:36:27,760
What?

488
00:36:28,844 --> 00:36:31,650
- Take over for me.
- Sure.

489
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:34,710
Why did you make Hae Yi do that?

490
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,371
How can you make her do that?

491
00:36:36,371 --> 00:36:38,684
My noodles are getting soggy.
I'm hanging up.

492
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:41,864
Hey, Sung Tae.

493
00:36:41,864 --> 00:36:42,876
Sung Tae!

494
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:45,815
Damn it.

495
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,922
<i>[Jang Hwa Sa]</i>

496
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,397
<i>[Choo Young Bae]</i>

497
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:32,277
Oh, I feel so nauseous.

498
00:37:32,277 --> 00:37:35,347
Just her face drives me insane.

499
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,728
Hae Yi.

500
00:37:55,644 --> 00:37:58,179
He really has such a big mouth.

501
00:37:58,179 --> 00:38:01,922
My relationship to Jang Hwa Sa
is different from what you heard.

502
00:38:01,922 --> 00:38:04,512
Everything you heard about me
is just a bunch of false rumors.

503
00:38:04,512 --> 00:38:05,898
What's not true?

504
00:38:05,898 --> 00:38:08,938
A prosecutor falling for
a pretty inmate on death row

505
00:38:08,938 --> 00:38:11,572
and secretly handing over
the evidence to her public defender?

506
00:38:11,572 --> 00:38:13,382
And getting fired as a prosecutor?

507
00:38:13,382 --> 00:38:16,713
The prosecutor who entrusted you to take
on Jang Hwa Sa's case killing himself?

508
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:18,525
Mom abandoning me and leaving?

509
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:28,572
Hae Yi.

510
00:38:28,572 --> 00:38:29,809
Hae Yi!

511
00:38:31,882 --> 00:38:34,344
Hae Yi.

512
00:38:34,344 --> 00:38:35,621
Hae Yi!

513
00:38:39,545 --> 00:38:43,175
Are you the one who got in the way
of her getting her sentence reduced?

514
00:38:44,858 --> 00:38:47,844
You came here this early
in the morning to ask me that?

515
00:38:47,844 --> 00:38:50,884
You couldn't even come to my graduation,
but you came here for her?

516
00:38:52,074 --> 00:38:55,188
Whether you're a lawyer or a prosecutor,
there are cases you can never forget.

517
00:38:55,188 --> 00:38:58,092
Cases you keep within your heart forever.

518
00:38:58,092 --> 00:39:01,250
Jang Hwa Sa's case
was such a case for me.

519
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:05,088
A lawyer shouldn't get involved
deeply with the client's story.

520
00:39:05,088 --> 00:39:07,278
Only authors have time
for that nonsense.

521
00:39:07,278 --> 00:39:10,614
A lawyer is an advocate for the client.

522
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:12,800
Everything is the truth.

523
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:21,128
If you ruined her chance at a sentence
reduction because you resent me

524
00:39:21,128 --> 00:39:23,829
please help her this time.

525
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:27,295
- Hae Yi, you can get her a retrial.
- Do it yourself!

526
00:39:27,295 --> 00:39:30,983
You may have been fired as a prosecutor,
but you're still a licensed attorney.

527
00:39:31,311 --> 00:39:32,545
Why?

528
00:39:32,545 --> 00:39:35,184
You gambled that away too?

529
00:39:35,784 --> 00:39:37,978
I guess so.

530
00:39:37,978 --> 00:39:41,623
Jang Hwa Sa is just an excuse.
You're here to beg for money.

531
00:39:43,586 --> 00:39:46,108
Here, use this for your gambling.

532
00:39:46,108 --> 00:39:50,900
You're a proud man.
Go and spend some money today.

533
00:40:13,414 --> 00:40:17,795
It will take some more time to find out
whether Jang Hwa Sa has a son.

534
00:40:17,795 --> 00:40:21,882
There are no birth records,
and her mother suffers from dementia.

535
00:40:21,882 --> 00:40:25,550
Please also find out who the medical
director at Cheongwon Prison is.

536
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:26,807
Sure.

537
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:33,382
- I'll get going then.
- Don't work so hard.

538
00:40:33,382 --> 00:40:37,003
Stop pushing off your appointment,
and come in for your check up.

539
00:40:37,003 --> 00:40:38,367
Okay.

540
00:40:43,293 --> 00:40:44,945
Yes, Hae Sun.

541
00:40:46,041 --> 00:40:47,150
What?

542
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:49,255
Gi San?

543
00:41:02,407 --> 00:41:04,561
That feels good.

544
00:41:04,561 --> 00:41:07,277
This isn't good for your heart.

545
00:41:07,277 --> 00:41:08,846
Let's go out.

546
00:41:10,099 --> 00:41:15,440
- Yoo Jin, just one more time.
- You'll end up fainting.

547
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,023
- Just one more time.
- Gi San.

548
00:41:17,023 --> 00:41:18,293
Come on...

549
00:41:18,293 --> 00:41:20,820
I envy how tall you are.

550
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:22,699
- Thank you, Hae Sun.
- Sure.

551
00:41:22,699 --> 00:41:24,166
Thank you.

552
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:29,637
Smells like green grass.

553
00:41:29,637 --> 00:41:33,302
Let's have steak for lunch.

554
00:41:33,302 --> 00:41:34,445
What would you like, Yoo Jin?

555
00:41:34,445 --> 00:41:37,244
You have leftover seaweed soup, right?
I'll eat that with rice.

556
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,106
Sure, okay.

557
00:41:39,106 --> 00:41:42,146
- Feels good.
- Sauna and steak...

558
00:41:42,146 --> 00:41:45,918
You need to realize that you're sick.

559
00:41:45,918 --> 00:41:51,500
Salads, vegetables, all those greens...
It's not for men.

560
00:41:52,186 --> 00:41:55,612
If you want to win in battle,
you need to eat blood and meat.

561
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:57,478
Come on, Gi San.

562
00:42:06,213 --> 00:42:11,929
Hae Sun was cleaning out your stuff,
and she found this.

563
00:42:13,896 --> 00:42:16,282
Did Dad give it to you before he died?

564
00:42:17,856 --> 00:42:20,081
No, Gi San.

565
00:42:24,635 --> 00:42:29,028
Who other than Dad
would give this to you?

566
00:42:32,157 --> 00:42:36,170
How do you know Jang Hwa Sa?

567
00:42:39,521 --> 00:42:42,514
I got that a few days ago
on my birthday.

568
00:42:42,514 --> 00:42:47,030
I don't know who sent it,
or why they sent it.

569
00:43:10,264 --> 00:43:12,342
I'm sorry, I know you tried.

570
00:43:13,135 --> 00:43:15,208
Hwa Sa.

571
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,121
I'm sorry.

572
00:43:19,121 --> 00:43:22,327
I thought you would get your sentence
reduced for sure this time.

573
00:43:28,697 --> 00:43:32,076
<i>You should have asked me
if you were curious.</i>

574
00:43:37,556 --> 00:43:44,539
Is it true that Choo Young Bae is another
one of Dad's illegitimate sons like me?

575
00:43:46,010 --> 00:43:48,295
You're different from
a low-class man like him.

576
00:43:48,295 --> 00:43:53,527
Dad never even accepted him
as his own son.

577
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,827
Then what about this woman,
Jang Hwa Sa?

578
00:43:57,827 --> 00:44:01,400
Is she my birth mother?

579
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,463
Your mother? Who?

580
00:44:04,929 --> 00:44:06,480
Who's your mother?

581
00:44:08,704 --> 00:44:11,936
How can my brother
be the son of a murderer?

582
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,306
Yoo Jin, it's written here.

583
00:44:17,306 --> 00:44:19,898
"Bizarre and evil woman, Jang Hwa Sa."

584
00:44:19,898 --> 00:44:23,067
She's a murderer.
You shouldn't waste your time on her.

585
00:44:25,059 --> 00:44:30,403
Dad didn't want you to know,
so I didn't get involved.

586
00:44:31,164 --> 00:44:35,481
I'll do my best to find
your birth mother for you.

587
00:44:35,481 --> 00:44:39,000
So you just focus on the hospital.

588
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,974
It will become yours.

589
00:44:48,887 --> 00:44:51,614
I should be a good doctor.

590
00:44:51,614 --> 00:44:54,003
Even if it's for your sake.

591
00:44:59,443 --> 00:45:00,936
You know...

592
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:06,626
how much I care about you, right?

593
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,650
Yes.

594
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:12,543
Of course.

595
00:45:22,099 --> 00:45:28,345
<i>[Room No. 9]</i>

596
00:45:37,213 --> 00:45:40,014
I'm sure you're not happy to see me.
I feel the same way.

597
00:45:41,190 --> 00:45:50,150
I heard my appeal attorney would be
the daughter of Prosecutor Eulji Sung.

598
00:45:53,565 --> 00:45:55,621
Let me introduce myself formally.

599
00:45:56,181 --> 00:45:58,436
I'm Attorney Eulji Hae Yi.

600
00:46:03,621 --> 00:46:07,827
Starting today, we'll meet 6 times
for 5 hours, for a total of 30 hours.

601
00:46:07,827 --> 00:46:09,711
You've heard of a housekeeping attorney?

602
00:46:09,711 --> 00:46:14,081
- The only thing I can do...
- I thought you were my appeal attorney.

603
00:46:16,447 --> 00:46:18,563
If you want to request an appeal

604
00:46:18,563 --> 00:46:23,134
you first need new evidence
that can overturn the original verdict.

605
00:46:23,134 --> 00:46:24,175
Secondly...

606
00:46:24,175 --> 00:46:29,429
you need to prove that the evidence used
to get to the verdict was manipulated.

607
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,400
Thirdly...

608
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,255
you need to prove that your confession
that you killed Choo Young Bae

609
00:46:34,255 --> 00:46:38,905
was made under pressure and false.

610
00:46:38,905 --> 00:46:41,880
You need to meet at least one
of these three conditions.

611
00:46:43,396 --> 00:46:47,119
I don't mind bringing you
doughnuts or coffee.

612
00:46:47,675 --> 00:46:51,682
I heard other housekeeping lawyers
keep their clients company, but not me.

613
00:46:51,682 --> 00:46:53,773
I'll sit here and work.

614
00:46:53,773 --> 00:46:56,693
You can sit there and rest comfortably.

615
00:46:56,693 --> 00:46:57,820
Okay?

616
00:47:18,619 --> 00:47:24,079
Why did you get in the way
of my sentence reduction?

617
00:47:25,463 --> 00:47:26,898
Why?

618
00:47:28,076 --> 00:47:31,599
I'm not the one who got in the way
of your sentence reduction.

619
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:33,599
Lies.

620
00:47:34,197 --> 00:47:36,706
I don't care whether
you believe me or not.

621
00:47:37,634 --> 00:47:40,635
It's true that I hate you.

622
00:47:41,934 --> 00:47:43,380
I'm leaving now.

623
00:48:02,469 --> 00:48:04,971
Are you Dr. So Young Cheol?

624
00:48:06,764 --> 00:48:10,222
Yes, I'm your school junior,
Gi Yoo Jin.

625
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,853
Oh...

626
00:49:15,853 --> 00:49:19,349
- Sorry, did you wait long?
- No, thank you for letting me do this.

627
00:49:19,349 --> 00:49:22,436
I'm the grateful one,
I know how busy fellows are.

628
00:49:22,436 --> 00:49:25,000
You're taking time on
your day off to do charity work.

629
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,201
But why were you in front
of the supply room?

630
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,221
I thought I heard something.

631
00:49:30,221 --> 00:49:32,057
You heard something?

632
00:49:34,856 --> 00:49:38,074
These places are like that.

633
00:49:38,074 --> 00:49:40,559
There's always a story or two
about ghosts.

634
00:49:41,347 --> 00:49:44,648
The spirits of dead inmates
wander around this place.

635
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,474
It would be weird if it wasn't haunted.

636
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,817
Did I scare you?

637
00:49:53,038 --> 00:49:54,777
I guess you get scared easy.

638
00:50:16,041 --> 00:50:18,420
Didn't you say you have diabetes?

639
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:21,463
If I knew you would like it so much,
I would have brought some more.

640
00:50:23,181 --> 00:50:25,099
No need for you to be so mean.

641
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:30,132
Actually, it's not as bad
as what you did to me.

642
00:50:31,264 --> 00:50:33,199
What did I do to you?

643
00:50:33,199 --> 00:50:38,266
You ruined a genius prosecutor who could
easily have made it to attorney general.

644
00:50:38,266 --> 00:50:41,097
You debilitated my dad.

645
00:50:44,085 --> 00:50:47,126
Wait, what happened to
Prosecutor Eulji Sung?

646
00:50:49,434 --> 00:50:53,358
I need to kill 30 hours.
Just eat your doughnut.

647
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:56,474
<i>It's a witch hunt.</i>

648
00:50:56,474 --> 00:50:58,766
<i>If you committed a crime,
you need to pay for it.</i>

649
00:50:59,425 --> 00:51:01,480
<i>I don't care if it's
the president's child or my own child.</i>

650
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,449
<i>Everybody is equal before the law.</i>

651
00:51:03,449 --> 00:51:07,831
<i>Just because he is the son
of SHC Group, and my own son</i>

652
00:51:07,831 --> 00:51:12,248
<i>he has no reason to be punished
for something he didn't do.</i>

653
00:51:12,248 --> 00:51:13,297
Who is that man?

654
00:51:13,297 --> 00:51:17,766
<i>National Forensics
already released their test results.</i>

655
00:51:19,554 --> 00:51:23,217
<i>- My son...</i>
- Are you crazy?

656
00:51:23,217 --> 00:51:24,764
<i>we ask for your consideration...</i>

657
00:51:33,346 --> 00:51:35,954
- Choo...
- Darn it.

658
00:51:35,954 --> 00:51:38,150
Choo Young...

659
00:51:41,704 --> 00:51:44,811
- Choo Young Bae...
- I'm so sick of you.

660
00:51:46,032 --> 00:51:47,731
Choo...

661
00:51:47,952 --> 00:51:49,545
Choo...

662
00:51:51,032 --> 00:51:53,286
Choo Young Bae...

663
00:51:56,818 --> 00:51:58,746
Officer! Officer!

664
00:52:02,539 --> 00:52:07,099
I want to meet Ms. Jang Hwa Sa.

665
00:52:07,625 --> 00:52:09,675
You know her?

666
00:52:09,675 --> 00:52:11,818
<i>Medical emergency!</i>

667
00:52:11,818 --> 00:52:14,606
<i>Inmate 122, Jang Hwa Sa,
is in cardiac arrest.</i>

668
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:22,943
- Get me the emergency kit.
- Sure.

669
00:52:23,509 --> 00:52:26,887
She's a DM patient with angina.

670
00:52:26,887 --> 00:52:30,110
It may be an AMI or a coronary spasm.

671
00:52:31,344 --> 00:52:33,579
Inmate 122. Inmate 122!

672
00:52:33,579 --> 00:52:35,023
Wake up, 122.

673
00:52:39,465 --> 00:52:41,050
Inmate 122.

674
00:52:41,476 --> 00:52:43,599
- Step aside!
- Oh, Yoo Jin!

675
00:52:43,599 --> 00:52:46,068
- What are you doing here?
- Let's talk later.

676
00:52:46,068 --> 00:52:47,643
Inmate 122!

677
00:52:48,795 --> 00:52:50,543
It's cardiac arrest.

678
00:52:51,715 --> 00:52:54,288
Director! Director.

679
00:52:54,288 --> 00:52:57,007
Inmate 6824 slit her wrist
with a toothbrush.

680
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,574
She's bleeding heavily.

681
00:52:58,574 --> 00:53:01,072
- Why now?
- You should go.

682
00:53:01,072 --> 00:53:02,398
I'll take care of her here.

683
00:53:02,398 --> 00:53:04,257
Thank you!

684
00:53:04,257 --> 00:53:05,586
Let's go.

685
00:53:05,858 --> 00:53:07,634
Officer, plug in the machine.

686
00:53:27,856 --> 00:53:29,762
You should step back.

687
00:53:30,117 --> 00:53:33,356
Here we go. One, two, three.

688
00:53:45,385 --> 00:53:47,668
What's going on?

689
00:53:47,668 --> 00:53:49,963
What's happening in
the middle of the day?

690
00:54:02,777 --> 00:54:05,925
One, two, three...

691
00:54:45,177 --> 00:54:48,666
<i>[Room No. 9]</i>

692
00:55:05,704 --> 00:55:09,697
Chairman, Jang Hwa Sa
collapsed from cardiac arrest

00:55:09,697 --> 00:55:11,541

694
00:55:22,003 --> 00:55:23,896
Unconscious?

695
00:55:29,132 --> 00:55:31,193
What a mess.

696
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:37,974
The end of a person is never that easy.

697
00:55:40,088 --> 00:55:41,860
It took a long time.

698
00:55:42,835 --> 00:55:45,400
Much longer...

699
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,300
than I thought.

700
00:56:02,976 --> 00:56:04,996
What's going on?

701
00:56:06,282 --> 00:56:07,777
She's up!

702
00:56:10,016 --> 00:56:11,793
Hallelujah!

703
00:56:14,331 --> 00:56:16,431
I'm so sorry.

704
00:56:16,431 --> 00:56:18,456
I have no words for this.

705
00:56:18,456 --> 00:56:22,427
We have never had such
a misfortune happen here...

706

- My cane.
- What?

707
00:56:26,061 --> 00:56:27,362
Cane?

708
00:56:27,362 --> 00:56:31,146
- Let's take her back.
- Okay.

709
00:56:33,230 --> 00:56:35,358
Are you feeling sick?

710
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:39,396
Wait!

711
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,802
What is it?

712
00:56:59,844 --> 00:57:02,150
What's wrong?

713
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:05,701
What are you doing?

714
00:57:16,525 --> 00:57:18,523
What's this?

715
00:57:19,476 --> 00:57:21,262
No...

716
00:57:22,311 --> 00:57:23,679
No!
