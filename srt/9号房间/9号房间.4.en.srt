00:02:22,788 --> 00:02:24,198
Anyone inside?

5
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:28,092
Anyone inside?

6
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,159
Hey.

7
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:48,781
<i>This is Park Chul Soon
from the investigation team.</i>

8
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:51,412
I found a homicide scene
during my morning jog.

9
00:02:51,413 --> 00:02:54,162
There's a male and a female.
The male is dead.

10
00:02:54,163 --> 00:02:56,218
<i>And the female is unconscious.</i>

11
00:02:56,389 --> 00:02:58,090
<i>They were inside a car.</i>

12
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:01,991
<i>I don't know if it was a stolen car.
I need to identify the driver.</i>

14
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:46,310
Stop overreacting.
You can handle this.

15
00:03:49,594 --> 00:03:50,835
Officer!

16
00:03:51,448 --> 00:03:53,622
Officer!

17
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:01,675
<i>It wasn't Choo Young Bae.</i>

18
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,213

<i>[Episode 4]
Of course, we called 911.</i>

21
00:04:13,747 --> 00:04:15,519
She'll die before they come.

22
00:04:16,504 --> 00:04:18,972
Who asked you to
leave the office, Doctor?

23
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:20,535
My goodness.

24
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:23,297
Warden, she's not breathing.

25
00:04:23,298 --> 00:04:27,249
- She's not breathing at all.
- Oh, goodness, please.

26
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,432
I can help her.

27
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,119
- You?
- That's right.

28
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,424
She's a nurse.

29
00:04:38,425 --> 00:04:40,559
Inmate 82, a nurse!

30
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:44,571
- Hurry, come this way.
- Hurry!

31
00:04:44,572 --> 00:04:46,114
- Open the door!
- Hurry!

32
00:04:46,115 --> 00:04:48,859
- Hurry!
- This way.

33
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,646
Here.

34
00:04:55,899 --> 00:05:00,874
<i>I don't know why, but the doctor will
be out of office next Thursday.</i>

35
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,669
<i>So what are you planning, Hwa Sa?</i>

36
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,470
You just need to bring the defibrillator.

37
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:10,708
<i>What if that lawyer dies from the shock?</i>

38
00:05:10,709 --> 00:05:13,237
<i>Whether she dies or not,
it's none of your business.</i>

39
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,925
It's in.

40
00:05:22,336 --> 00:05:24,906
- Get her ready.
- Okay.

41
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:29,269
Get out of here.

42
00:05:29,814 --> 00:05:32,626
I'm just worried.

43
00:05:32,627 --> 00:05:34,936
You're in the way.
Get out!

44
00:05:34,937 --> 00:05:38,052
- Get out.
- Hurry!

45
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:43,690
Ready.

46
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,668
Shock!

47
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,059
First, reduce both
the shoes and heels' height.

48
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:24,131
Calculating the volume, we reduce
7.1 percent of the physical volume

49
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:27,145
and 4.2 percent of the height.

50
00:06:27,146 --> 00:06:30,090
Compare the left contestant
and the right contestant's

51
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:32,921
height, shoulders, arms, and legs.

52
00:06:32,922 --> 00:06:35,281
Physiognomy comparison.

53
00:06:35,911 --> 00:06:40,340
Next, we analyze the footage
to compare the forensic gait results.

54
00:06:40,341 --> 00:06:43,494
Body movement form, match.

55
00:06:43,495 --> 00:06:46,257
Frequency and gaiting patterns...

56
00:06:50,302 --> 00:06:52,201
Match.

57
00:06:58,622 --> 00:07:01,596
I was right.

58
00:07:02,225 --> 00:07:05,181
It was you.

59
00:07:05,182 --> 00:07:06,908
Eulji Hae Yi.

60
00:07:23,773 --> 00:07:30,769
<i>Congratulations on
your promotion to senior partner!</i>

61
00:07:33,706 --> 00:07:35,399
<i>Thanks.</i>

62
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:42,048
I mean it.

63
00:07:42,855 --> 00:07:44,552
Thanks.

64
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:58,120
You're up?

65
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:04,427
Who do I look like to you?

66
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,211
Why are you scaring me, Hwa Sa?

67
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,250
You're up?

68
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,894
I think there was something important.

69
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,827
But I can't remember.

70
00:08:41,828 --> 00:08:46,022
You had an electric shock, why did you
eat that without checking first?

71
00:08:46,221 --> 00:08:47,739
Ms. Jang Hwa Sa.

72
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,216
- If this isn't it...
- Jang Hwa Sa.

73
00:08:50,217 --> 00:08:52,764
- Then what is it?
- Ms. Jang Hwa Sa!

74
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,138
- Officer!
- What is it?

75
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:57,335
It's okay.

76
00:08:58,101 --> 00:09:00,505
I have something to say
to Ms. Jang Hwa Sa.

77
00:09:14,174 --> 00:09:16,249
A peach allergy?

78
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,249
It would have been great
if I had succeeded.

79
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,396
You almost killed your own self.

80
00:09:20,397 --> 00:09:23,868
Rather than die as Inmate 122,
Jang Hwa Sa...

81
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,466
I would die trying.

82
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:30,949
Forget our meeting.

83
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:34,114
I'm finished. Let's call it quits.

84
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,531
I've still got the upper hand.

85
00:09:36,532 --> 00:09:41,076
You may never be able to
see your mother again.

86
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,854
I'm so sorry.
I have nothing to say to you.

87
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:00,148
I can't get mad even if you press charges

88
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,598
but you should have been careful
about your allergies, no?

89
00:10:02,599 --> 00:10:03,937
Don't you agree?

90
00:10:04,658 --> 00:10:09,479
I won't do anything to harm you, Warden.
You don't need to worry.

91
00:10:11,168 --> 00:10:13,114
Follow me.

92
00:10:20,831 --> 00:10:23,629
- Come on, hurry up!
- Oh...

93
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:40,854
What's the hidden story behind
Jang Hwa Sa and Gi Yoo Jin?

94
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:48,384
I guess you were curious
why I kept coming around to see you.

95
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,604
You worked for my father,
so I'm sure you know.

96
00:10:52,605 --> 00:10:55,248
He was a real ladies' man.

97
00:10:55,249 --> 00:10:57,237
Me, Choo Young Bae...

98
00:10:57,238 --> 00:10:59,364
We are both his illegitimate sons.

99
00:10:59,365 --> 00:11:02,294
- I thought you may be my mother.
- What?

100
00:11:04,571 --> 00:11:07,845
Jang Hwa Sa's your mother?

101
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:14,333
No, you think I'm your biological mother?

102
00:11:28,948 --> 00:11:32,249
<i>[Jang Hwa Sa and Gi Yoo Jin
are not biologically related.]</i>

103
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,850
<i>No.</i>

104
00:11:34,663 --> 00:11:36,441
You're not.

105
00:11:37,758 --> 00:11:42,152
In a way I'm confused, and in another,
I'm relieved that you're not my mother.

106
00:11:46,293 --> 00:11:48,109
Please take care of your health.

107
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:51,062
You need to be careful with diabetes.

108
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:54,576
I guess you came to say bye.

109
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:58,123
Now that you know I'm not your mother.

110
00:11:59,234 --> 00:12:00,649
Yeah.

111
00:12:01,636 --> 00:12:05,365
It wouldn't be your style
to disappear without saying goodbye.

112
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:10,904
I'm glad that she's not your mother.

113
00:12:11,716 --> 00:12:16,268
If Jang Hwa Sa were your mother,
it'd have been horrible for both of us.

114
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:20,605
Why are you talking about yourself
in the third person?

115
00:12:28,972 --> 00:12:31,523
I know it's hard to believe...

116
00:12:31,524 --> 00:12:36,326
I can't even believe it myself...

117
00:12:37,623 --> 00:12:39,845
But I...

118
00:12:39,846 --> 00:12:45,068
I'm Hae Yi, Eulji Hae Yi.

119
00:12:45,186 --> 00:12:53,186
I don't want to have to tell you
that I'm me, looking this pathetic...

120
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:57,086
I feel like dying right now...

121
00:12:57,554 --> 00:12:59,191
Seriously...

122
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:01,561
But I'll prove it to you.

123
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:03,892
Please listen to me.

124
00:13:03,893 --> 00:13:06,772
Then you'll believe me too.

125
00:13:08,652 --> 00:13:11,148
That peach.

126
00:13:11,149 --> 00:13:14,011
Did you give that to Hae Yi on purpose?

127
00:13:19,604 --> 00:13:22,183
I had no other option.

128
00:13:23,922 --> 00:13:25,975
You psycho...

129
00:13:25,976 --> 00:13:27,045
No!

130
00:13:27,046 --> 00:13:28,513
Don't go!

131
00:13:28,514 --> 00:13:30,450
No, Yoo Jin!

132
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:32,103
Let's go.

133
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:37,533
If I'm not Hae Yi, how would I have
known about her peach allergy?

134
00:13:43,765 --> 00:13:47,802
If you abandon me too,
then I'll have no hope.

135
00:13:50,349 --> 00:13:53,196
What is this nonsense?

136
00:13:53,197 --> 00:13:56,540
You're nothing to me.
You're just a murderer.

137
00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:59,125
You killed my brother, Choo Young Bae,
and you tried to kill Hae Yi...

138
00:13:59,126 --> 00:14:01,196
Please, Yoo Jin.

139
00:14:01,197 --> 00:14:05,253
Please listen to me, so I can prove it.

140
00:14:06,674 --> 00:14:10,046
- Jang Hwa Sa!
- You're Jang Hwa Sa.

141
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:13,427
You need to tell the truth to Yoo Jin.

142
00:14:16,797 --> 00:14:18,311
If you keep doing this

143
00:14:18,312 --> 00:14:21,480
I'll have to send you away
to Gongju Prison.

144
00:14:24,006 --> 00:14:25,779
Let's go.

145
00:14:42,917 --> 00:14:46,433
<i>Even Yoo Jin's rejected me.</i>

146
00:14:47,913 --> 00:14:50,298
<i>It hurts.</i>

147
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,977
Hwa Sa, can you taste this?

148
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:04,277
What happened to her?

149
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,818
She's so unlucky,
she got another electric shock.

150
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:12,676
<i>That story about the defibrillator
was total nonsense.</i>

151
00:15:12,677 --> 00:15:17,106
<i>Just like the numerous amateurs
that I had always despised</i>

152
00:15:17,107 --> 00:15:22,537
<i>I had expected a lucky punch,
and I swung my fist without thinking.</i>

153
00:15:22,538 --> 00:15:27,418
<i>And the result was
a complete defeat by knockout.</i>

154
00:15:34,346 --> 00:15:35,894
Hold on.

155
00:15:38,716 --> 00:15:41,873
I changed the passcode.

156
00:15:45,405 --> 00:15:47,658
What's this signal?

157
00:15:47,659 --> 00:15:49,919
How am I supposed to take this?

158
00:15:50,822 --> 00:15:54,215
I have a lot to do.

159
00:15:54,216 --> 00:15:57,897
And I have a lot of documents
in there that I need to keep secure.

160
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:00,870
Secure?

161
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:06,738
You seem very distant these days.

162
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,917
The way you look at me...

163
00:16:10,668 --> 00:16:12,743
You seem like a different person.

164
00:16:18,562 --> 00:16:20,658
Make sure you take your medicine.

165
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,324
Hello.

166
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:33,946
- Hey...
- Yes?

167
00:16:33,947 --> 00:16:37,082
Why did you bring me here?

168
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,620
They look so expensive.

169
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:44,029
I dreamed that you
bought me this, Honey.

170
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,961
Come on...

171
00:16:45,962 --> 00:16:51,253
Even the rich go bankrupt in three years
if they're too prodigal.

172
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:55,944
Here.

173
00:16:57,554 --> 00:17:04,394
If you keep shopping like this,
you'll use up all my money.

174
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:09,070
Look, your honey is calling.

175
00:17:09,071 --> 00:17:12,337
Don't worry about it.
You're the only honey I have.

176
00:17:12,338 --> 00:17:13,827
Oh...

177
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:15,594
I can't do this.

178
00:17:15,595 --> 00:17:19,873
Why don't you just ask your
other honey to buy this for you?

179
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:22,076
Honey. Honey!

180
00:17:27,071 --> 00:17:30,653
- Who the hell are you?
<i>- It's me, Jang Hwa Sa.</i>

181
00:17:30,654 --> 00:17:34,523
You crazy wench, you don't think
I would recognize Hwa Sa's voice?

182
00:17:37,234 --> 00:17:38,315
It's steaming hot.

183
00:17:38,316 --> 00:17:40,800
The sun's about to set,
why is it so hot?

184
00:17:40,801 --> 00:17:42,753
I'll get cooked up in this heat.

185
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,215
What the hell!

186
00:17:48,463 --> 00:17:50,358
What are you doing here?

187
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:57,481
How did you find out I live here?

188
00:17:57,482 --> 00:18:00,560
It's not just once or twice that
we wrote letters to each other.

189
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:02,883
I asked the realtor.

190
00:18:04,811 --> 00:18:07,105
Did you eat dinner?

191
00:18:07,949 --> 00:18:10,882
Why do you keep talking down to me?

192
00:18:13,018 --> 00:18:16,749
Maybe you were 24 in 1997...

193
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,108
The first time you went to jail.

194
00:18:19,795 --> 00:18:21,812
It was so damn cold then.

195
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:25,768
It was -13 or -15 degrees.

196
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:30,348
It was so cold that
the boiling kettle in the room froze.

197
00:18:32,058 --> 00:18:34,873
Since you were an orphan

198
00:18:34,874 --> 00:18:38,124
nobody ever came to visit you
or bring you warm thermals.

199
00:18:43,997 --> 00:18:46,420
You got frostbite...

200
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:53,951
How do you know that?

201
00:18:58,087 --> 00:19:01,064
Are you...

202
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:06,545
Hwa Sa's...

203
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:09,008
daughter?

204
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:21,087
The sixth time you were sent to jail,
I guess you were a bit better off.

205
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:27,144
You would order instant noodles from
the commissary, and give them to me.

206
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:32,842
You're not Hwa Sa's daughter?

207
00:19:33,648 --> 00:19:35,604
Then...

208
00:19:35,605 --> 00:19:37,861
Are you...

209
00:19:38,436 --> 00:19:41,249
possessed? A shaman?

210
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,389
What a waste.

211
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:46,009
You don't need to be a lawyer
to become a shaman.

212
00:19:47,785 --> 00:19:49,646
Pal Pal.

213
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,054
It's me, Jang Hwa Sa.

214
00:19:59,417 --> 00:20:00,990
So what if you are a lawyer?

215
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,683
You tried to play me over the phone too.

216
00:20:03,974 --> 00:20:06,991
How dare you give me this nonsense?

217
00:20:12,449 --> 00:20:17,789
If you choose to believe,
there are 1,000 reasons to believe.

218
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,281
But if you choose not to believe,
everything around you seems like a fraud.

219
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:31,259
How do you believe that he died
and was resurrected after three days?

220
00:20:37,517 --> 00:20:41,919
Still, how can I believe you?

221
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:45,244
How do you expect me to believe that?

222
00:20:52,258 --> 00:20:57,372
You should have been born into
a rich family with both parents alive.

223
00:20:58,236 --> 00:21:00,270
You poor thing.

224
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:36,276
<i>I heard your fingers and toes get
really cold when you're diabetic.</i>

225
00:21:36,277 --> 00:21:39,856
You should warm up your fingers,
and warm up your inside too.

226
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:52,412
You should have been born into
a rich family with both parents alive.

227
00:21:52,413 --> 00:21:54,028
You poor thing.

228
00:22:19,883 --> 00:22:21,932
You'll catch a cold.

229
00:22:33,079 --> 00:22:34,501
Hwa Sa.

230
00:22:34,502 --> 00:22:36,152
Hwa Sa!

231
00:22:36,153 --> 00:22:40,103
Hwa Sa!

232
00:22:40,104 --> 00:22:43,685
Hwa Sa!

233
00:22:43,686 --> 00:22:47,461
Hwa Sa...

234
00:22:51,352 --> 00:22:55,063
Hwa Sa!

235
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,898
Uncle!

236
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:01,970
Loser pays for beer.

237
00:23:01,971 --> 00:23:04,357
Stop messing around.

238
00:23:21,828 --> 00:23:26,434
<i>If you abandon me too,
then I'll have no hope.</i>

239
00:23:27,817 --> 00:23:29,703
<i>Who's your mother?</i>

240
00:23:30,346 --> 00:23:34,141
I'll find your birth mother for you.

241
00:23:34,142 --> 00:23:36,470
I changed the passcode.

242
00:23:37,097 --> 00:23:39,131
<i>I have a lot to do.</i>

243
00:23:39,132 --> 00:23:42,354
<i>You just focus on the hospital.</i>

244
00:23:50,759 --> 00:23:54,118
Uncle, you've gotten so weak.

245
00:23:56,275 --> 00:23:58,557
Chan Sung.

246
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:03,021
Since I was 15 years old,
my motto's always been...

247
00:24:04,275 --> 00:24:06,748
"No complications."

248
00:24:08,218 --> 00:24:10,905
I really want to live simply.

249
00:24:12,281 --> 00:24:15,558
But I don't know why things are
getting so complicated these days.

250
00:24:18,349 --> 00:24:19,949
Let me just forget.

251
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,856
My goodness!

252
00:24:48,718 --> 00:24:51,431
Ma'am.

253
00:24:51,432 --> 00:24:54,815
When will Mal Boon get to go home?

254
00:24:57,452 --> 00:25:00,111
Let's go to my house and eat noodles.

255
00:25:00,112 --> 00:25:03,465
And I'll take you to where
you used to live before.

256
00:25:05,462 --> 00:25:08,046
Let's brush your hair, Mom.

257
00:25:18,288 --> 00:25:24,450
You used to make the best noodles, Mom.

258
00:25:24,977 --> 00:25:26,563
Right?

259
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:35,576
What happened to her head?

260
00:25:36,250 --> 00:25:38,721
Why, what happened to her head?

261
00:25:41,211 --> 00:25:44,746
So what is this scar on her head, Honey?

262
00:25:44,747 --> 00:25:47,396
- The elderly fall easily in the home.
- Yeah.

263
00:25:47,397 --> 00:25:51,014
They often bump into table edges,
beds, and TV stands.

264
00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:56,567
Those scars are usually straight
or shaped like an L and indented.

265
00:25:57,064 --> 00:25:59,749
Can you please explain,
so we can understand?

266
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:03,729
It's in the center of her head
and shaped like a star.

267
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:07,652
This indicates that she must have
been hit from straight above.

268
00:26:07,653 --> 00:26:08,961
Then?

269
00:26:08,962 --> 00:26:12,496
Are you saying that
somebody hit her with a weapon?

270
00:26:12,497 --> 00:26:15,053
Who would do such a thing?

271
00:26:17,661 --> 00:26:23,195
<i>Hwa Sa, I'm almost done finding
all the evidence to get you out.</i>

272
00:26:23,196 --> 00:26:27,336
So please don't die.

273
00:26:28,549 --> 00:26:32,449
You can't die and leave me behind.

274
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:35,150
Don't lose hope.

275
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:39,949
Trust me and have faith in yourself.

276
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:44,484
You need to hang in there, okay?

277
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:48,649
Could dementia have been
the result of that trauma?

278
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:52,296
If it was too much for her to handle...

279
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,319
<i>- Inmate 720.
- Yes?</i>

280
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,913
<i>You have a visitor.</i>

281
00:27:01,099 --> 00:27:03,027
- Inmate 342.
- Yes.

282
00:27:03,028 --> 00:27:05,456
- Inmate 8764.
- Yes.

283
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,568
- Inmate 3457.
- Yes.

284
00:27:07,569 --> 00:27:08,921
Visitor.

285
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:51,228
<i>Tight, tight.</i>

286
00:27:51,229 --> 00:27:53,144
<i>Yay!</i>

287
00:27:53,815 --> 00:27:55,789
<i>Tight, tight.</i>

288
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,749
<i>Yay!</i>

289
00:27:57,750 --> 00:27:59,951
<i>Tight, tight.</i>

290
00:27:59,952 --> 00:28:01,145
<i>Yay!</i>

291
00:28:02,134 --> 00:28:05,414
<i>Tight, tight. Yay!</i>

292
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,026
It's good.

293
00:28:25,018 --> 00:28:33,018
I didn't even know why
you weren't coming to visit.

294
00:28:34,817 --> 00:28:38,906
Ma'am, why are you crying again?

295
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:46,487
Why are you so sorrowful
that you cry every time you see me?

296
00:28:46,488 --> 00:28:49,144
Don't cry.

297
00:28:50,257 --> 00:28:52,386
Stop crying.

298
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:06,010
You must have had such a hard life, Mom.

299
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,160
That you gave birth to a murderer...

300
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:19,288
I'm sure everyone pointed
their fingers at you.

301
00:29:22,477 --> 00:29:30,477
I will prove to everyone that
your daughter is not a murderer.

302
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:42,230
Mom.

303
00:29:42,675 --> 00:29:44,868
Mom.

304
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,250
Mom.

305
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,632
Don't cry.

306
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,058
I love you, Mom.

307
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,096
I'm sorry, Mom.

308
00:30:00,488 --> 00:30:02,404
Mom.

309
00:30:21,849 --> 00:30:24,587
If you maintain these levels
until the next visit

310
00:30:24,588 --> 00:30:26,415
we can cut your medication by half.

311
00:30:27,049 --> 00:30:30,194
- It looks great.
- Thank you, Doctor.

312
00:30:30,849 --> 00:30:32,394
Get in safely.

313
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,566
You know 333, right?

314
00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:38,817
3 days a week, stretch for 3 minutes,
and exercise for 30 minutes.

315
00:30:38,818 --> 00:30:40,821
- You can do it!
- Yeah!

316
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,811
Such a vibrant energy in here...

317
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,500
Did you find it?

318
00:30:52,145 --> 00:30:57,510
What could I do when she asked me to
make seaweed soup for Dr. Gi's birthday?

319
00:30:57,511 --> 00:31:01,442
I owed Attorney Eulji a big favor.

320
00:31:01,925 --> 00:31:06,490
Seeing that you weren't on the elevator
CCTV, you must have used the stairs.

321
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:07,958
All 13 stories.

322
00:31:07,959 --> 00:31:11,155
You ran into somebody then, right?
Who was that?

323
00:31:13,962 --> 00:31:15,270
Oh!

324
00:31:15,271 --> 00:31:16,812
Oh my goodness...

325
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:20,767
<i>It was so heavy,
I was pouting as I was coming down.</i>

326
00:31:20,768 --> 00:31:24,049
<i>The sensor lights came on suddenly.</i>

327
00:31:24,050 --> 00:31:27,972
<i>And I heard someone breathing
heavily through his nose.</i>

328
00:31:27,973 --> 00:31:29,944
<i>I was so scared.</i>

329
00:31:29,945 --> 00:31:32,643
Why are you using the stairs
when there's an elevator?

330
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,750
Are you exercising?

331
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:38,992
If you see his face again,
would you recognize him?

332
00:31:38,993 --> 00:31:43,323
My job requires me to deal with people,
so I'm good at remembering faces

333
00:31:43,324 --> 00:31:46,673
but he had his head down,
and it was all covered up.

334
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:49,105
Oh?

335
00:31:49,106 --> 00:31:50,196
No.

336
00:31:50,394 --> 00:31:52,132
No.

337
00:31:52,413 --> 00:31:53,574
No.

338
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,682
Wait, stop.

339
00:31:55,683 --> 00:31:57,952
Yeah, this watch...

340
00:31:57,953 --> 00:32:01,145
When he put his hat down, I saw this.

341
00:32:01,146 --> 00:32:04,737
It's that watch...
G-Dragon's must-have item.

342
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:10,734
Did I give you an important clue?
Oh my goodness, this is so thrilling!

343
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:15,548
My memory is great, isn't it?

344
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:19,714
Hey, punk!

345
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:24,992
I heard Inspector Lee from the NFS
will be a witness at the next trial.

346
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:27,630
I'm saying this for your own good.

347
00:32:27,631 --> 00:32:32,053
Can you let Gi Chan Sung's case go,
and focus on giving out tickets?

348
00:32:32,054 --> 00:32:35,789
- You want to get in more trouble?
- Worry about yourself.

349
00:32:35,817 --> 00:32:36,864
Hi.

350
00:32:36,865 --> 00:32:39,162
You'll get cancer from all the stress.

351
00:32:39,163 --> 00:32:42,935
Stop following me, and get on
the elevator to the fourth floor.

352
00:32:42,936 --> 00:32:45,880
You work in the traffic department.

353
00:32:48,881 --> 00:32:50,480
Oh?

354
00:32:51,250 --> 00:32:52,989
Damjang.

355
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,615
That's Gi Chan Sung's lawyer, right?

356
00:32:56,705 --> 00:32:58,387
Drink it.

357
00:32:58,388 --> 00:33:00,617
The investigation records
from 34 years ago?

358
00:33:00,618 --> 00:33:02,872
Jang Hwa Sa's Seconal murder case.

359
00:33:02,873 --> 00:33:05,085
It was a case in 1984.

360
00:33:05,086 --> 00:33:08,460
Oh my goodness,
what brings you here?

361
00:33:12,176 --> 00:33:15,177
Witness statement,
suspect interrogation report

362
00:33:15,178 --> 00:33:17,636
written arraignment, the judgment.

363
00:33:17,637 --> 00:33:20,357
You even have the petition here.

364
00:33:20,358 --> 00:33:22,599
Wow, it must be over 2,000 pages.

365
00:33:22,964 --> 00:33:25,124
But where's the comments page?

366
00:33:25,125 --> 00:33:28,101
The detective in charge was Kim Jong Soo.

367
00:33:28,102 --> 00:33:29,614
Kim Jong Soo?

368
00:33:29,615 --> 00:33:31,220
That's weird.

369
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:34,501
He was from this department,
so I thought the files would be here.

370
00:33:34,502 --> 00:33:37,367
The sentence was already given,
so it'll be in Seocho.

371
00:33:38,634 --> 00:33:41,976
Tell me what it is exactly
that you want to find.

372
00:33:43,125 --> 00:33:45,817
Photos from the incident site back then.

373
00:33:47,453 --> 00:33:49,824
Will you take me out to eat?

374
00:33:49,825 --> 00:33:51,985
I guess you have no choice,
you'll have to take me out.

375
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:55,572
I've got gourmet taste,
I don't just eat anything.

376
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:02,799
Yes, Prosecutor.
This is Oh Bong Sam.

377
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,292
I was calling to see

378
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:09,737
if you can get me into the file room at
the Central District Prosecutors' Office.

379
00:34:10,458 --> 00:34:12,291
Yes.

380
00:34:23,992 --> 00:34:27,744
Oh, I guess this rain won't let down.

381
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:33,052
Sir.

382
00:34:39,099 --> 00:34:42,425
What are you doing here, Dr. Gi?

383
00:34:57,121 --> 00:34:58,864
Thank you.

384
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,348
Gab Dol, come here...

385
00:35:02,349 --> 00:35:03,994
Oh, you....

386
00:35:11,418 --> 00:35:14,719
You walked up 13 stories
with your weight...

387
00:35:15,724 --> 00:35:18,791
What was the reason you had
to deliver this to me?

388
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:27,035
Gab Dol, Daddy has to talk to the guest.

389
00:35:27,036 --> 00:35:28,852
Go outside, and play, okay?

390
00:35:28,853 --> 00:35:32,770
Yeah, yeah... My baby...

391
00:35:32,771 --> 00:35:34,198
Here!

392
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:36,251
Go!

393
00:35:41,291 --> 00:35:45,182
Eulji Sung's daughter, Eulji Hae Yi.

394
00:35:46,054 --> 00:35:48,210
Jang Hwa Sa.

395
00:35:49,786 --> 00:35:52,147
And Yoo Jin.

396
00:35:52,148 --> 00:35:57,314
If it was just two overlapping,
it could just be coincidence.

397
00:35:57,315 --> 00:36:00,541
But seeing that
more than two are overlapping

398
00:36:02,103 --> 00:36:05,683
someone must be behind this.

399
00:36:05,684 --> 00:36:09,159
You think it's Yoo Jin?

400
00:36:09,902 --> 00:36:16,163
He's clever, but he's too
soft-hearted to do such a thing.

401
00:36:18,804 --> 00:36:25,844
What if there is a fourth party
that's controlling all three?

402
00:36:29,791 --> 00:36:31,603
I need to get this call.

403
00:36:35,784 --> 00:36:37,632
Send it right now.

404
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:51,444
Getting rid of Chairman Gi San...

405
00:36:51,445 --> 00:36:58,234
and swallowing SHC Group whole...

406
00:36:58,235 --> 00:37:01,795
Have you ever had such an ambition?

407
00:37:15,668 --> 00:37:17,414
So it was him.

408
00:37:17,972 --> 00:37:20,568
Ma Hyun Cheol.

409
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:26,348
<i>I was raised as a doctor
as my brother had wanted.</i>

410
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:31,516
I'm the furthest one away from
the power struggle of SHC Group.

411
00:37:33,048 --> 00:37:35,380
Are you afraid of your brother?

412
00:37:36,534 --> 00:37:41,432
I thought Jang Hwa Sa was
my birth mother, but she wasn't.

413
00:37:42,211 --> 00:37:46,507
What do you know that I don't know?

414
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:54,750
If I put together the puzzle for you,
what will you give me?

415
00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:00,068
Tell me what you want.

416
00:38:01,355 --> 00:38:08,996
As the rightful successor,
you should swallow SHC Group whole.

417
00:38:10,652 --> 00:38:18,652
But give me all the shares of Damjang
that Chairman Gi San owns.

418
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,910
<i>Dad! Dad!</i>

419
00:38:29,911 --> 00:38:31,556
Soo Ji.

420
00:38:31,557 --> 00:38:32,907
Soo Ji, what's wrong?

421
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,462
What happened?

422
00:38:35,463 --> 00:38:36,640
What's wrong?

423
00:38:36,641 --> 00:38:39,415
Dad, Dad... Our Gab Dol...

424
00:38:39,416 --> 00:38:43,449
- What's wrong?
- Look, our Gab Dol.

425
00:38:44,349 --> 00:38:45,980
Oh my goodness!

426
00:38:51,028 --> 00:38:52,554
Gab Dol...

427
00:38:54,005 --> 00:38:56,449
Gab Dol... Gab Dol...

428
00:38:57,275 --> 00:39:00,833
- My poor baby...
- We should take him to a vet...

429
00:39:04,447 --> 00:39:06,724
Get out of my house right now!

430
00:39:26,449 --> 00:39:29,106
<i>Who is he?</i>

431
00:39:32,235 --> 00:39:35,885
He's the next owner of San Hae Group.

432
00:39:40,398 --> 00:39:42,684
So who is he?

433
00:39:44,277 --> 00:39:46,942
His name is Gi Yoo Jin.

434
00:39:46,943 --> 00:39:52,253
He will be San Hae Group's heir.

435
00:40:23,106 --> 00:40:25,387
I sweated so much.

436
00:40:32,449 --> 00:40:35,618
You like stealing your dad's drinks?

437
00:40:35,619 --> 00:40:37,453
I do.

438
00:40:37,454 --> 00:40:39,094
Son.

439
00:40:42,387 --> 00:40:44,934
Take everything.

440
00:40:47,349 --> 00:40:52,793
All of SHC belongs to you anyway.

441
00:40:53,672 --> 00:41:00,010
I've grown it this much,
so I can pass it down to you.

442
00:41:00,246 --> 00:41:03,396
- Oh...
- So that I can give it to you.

443
00:41:04,144 --> 00:41:05,964
That itches...

444
00:41:05,965 --> 00:41:09,575
Can we eat rice?
You're a great cook.

445
00:41:09,576 --> 00:41:11,749
You're the best.

446
00:41:11,750 --> 00:41:14,085
I have no time, I'm busy.

447
00:41:14,086 --> 00:41:17,496
It's been 34 years.
I want to stop cooking too.

448
00:41:19,349 --> 00:41:21,466
Fine.

449
00:41:21,467 --> 00:41:23,284
It's so convenient.

450
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,342
<i>I need you right now.</i>

451
00:41:43,938 --> 00:41:45,876
<i>I want to see you.</i>

452
00:42:02,641 --> 00:42:06,809
You know that the statute of
limitations has passed, right?

453
00:42:07,849 --> 00:42:10,362
This happened 34 years ago.

454
00:42:14,608 --> 00:42:17,917
A judge who hears 200 cases a month.

455
00:42:17,918 --> 00:42:23,321
A detective who gets notice that a sex
offender is being released to his area

456
00:42:23,322 --> 00:42:26,049
but doesn't even read it.

457
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:27,203
Statute of limitations?

458
00:42:27,204 --> 00:42:31,463
Even if it hadn't passed,
I would never rely on them.

459
00:42:33,538 --> 00:42:35,918
What other option do you have then?

460
00:42:40,074 --> 00:42:42,175
They say when your child dies...

461
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:46,961
you bury him in your heart.

462
00:42:50,414 --> 00:42:52,901
<i>I'm sure Choo Young Bae knows.</i>

463
00:42:52,902 --> 00:42:55,800
<i>He loves his son so much.</i>

464
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:00,740
He seems willing to kill anyone
if it's for his son.

465
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:06,649
Gi Chan Sung. I'll start with him.

466
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,049
You'll kill him?

467
00:43:09,050 --> 00:43:12,519
A pain that's worse than death.

468
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:17,916
Son. Wife.

469
00:43:19,311 --> 00:43:21,060
SHC.

470
00:43:21,061 --> 00:43:24,817
None of that belonged to this man
to begin with.

471
00:43:24,818 --> 00:43:31,493
I'll send him back to those days
when he had nothing.

472
00:43:31,494 --> 00:43:33,421
Choo Young Bae.

473
00:43:33,422 --> 00:43:36,326
Only that name will remain.

474
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:45,793
Who is it in the middle of the night?

475
00:43:49,371 --> 00:43:53,941
<i>- Should we act like we're not home?</i>
- They can see the lights from outside.

476
00:43:53,942 --> 00:43:56,156
Who is it? Is it your boyfriend?

477
00:43:56,157 --> 00:43:58,106
Oh...

478
00:43:59,641 --> 00:44:02,424
Detective, what brings you here?

479
00:44:02,425 --> 00:44:05,640
I got access to the file room at Seocho.

480
00:44:05,641 --> 00:44:08,415
<i>Thank you.</i>

481
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:12,500
I'm not saying this because I want to
go with you, but I may come in handy.

482
00:44:12,501 --> 00:44:17,017
And tomorrow is my day off,
so if you want, I can go with you.

483
00:44:17,018 --> 00:44:20,069
It would be great if you
can go with me.

484
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:23,124
<i>Why don't you come up?
I'll treat you to iced coffee...</i>

485
00:44:23,125 --> 00:44:26,896
Come on, you're going to
give me sugar water again?

486
00:44:29,018 --> 00:44:32,787
- I'll make you iced coffee this time.
- I am thirsty.

487
00:44:32,788 --> 00:44:36,735
I'm getting very thirsty.

488
00:44:37,427 --> 00:44:40,406
I don't know if I should go up...

489
00:44:40,407 --> 00:44:42,536
What am I saying?

490
00:44:44,605 --> 00:44:47,654
Oh, Bong Sam, nice timing.

491
00:44:47,655 --> 00:44:49,227
Go bring a glass.

492
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:52,553
My face will get swollen.
You can drink alone.

493
00:44:52,554 --> 00:44:56,697
Oh, this is cucumber.
You should save this for the skin.

494
00:44:59,762 --> 00:45:03,663
Did he lose his mind breathing in
all that pollution on the roads?

495
00:45:08,911 --> 00:45:11,401
00915...

496
00:45:11,402 --> 00:45:13,600
00915...

497
00:45:13,601 --> 00:45:15,261
"2EY71."

498
00:45:15,262 --> 00:45:17,502
"Masan Cyanide Rice Wine Case."

499
00:45:17,503 --> 00:45:19,207
I'm sure this is the right section.

500
00:45:19,208 --> 00:45:21,564
Usually, employees are supposed to
bring these out to you.

501
00:45:21,565 --> 00:45:25,448
But since I went about it by using my
connections, you know what I'm saying?

502
00:45:25,449 --> 00:45:27,988
You should be good to me.
Yeah, of course.

503
00:45:27,989 --> 00:45:31,250
Here it is, "Jang Hwa Sa's
Seconal Poisoning Case."

504
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:33,505
Wow...

505
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,570
This is it, right?

506
00:45:38,606 --> 00:45:40,983
The petition is here.

507
00:45:49,527 --> 00:45:51,661
Bingo.

508
00:46:01,527 --> 00:46:03,956
The emergency crew is pictured here.

509
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:09,200
And this is a picture of Namsan Tower.

510
00:46:09,201 --> 00:46:10,958
They took a photo of the car too.

511
00:46:12,505 --> 00:46:15,163
But there's no photo of the dead person.

512
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:21,149
Does it make sense that there isn't
a single photo of the driver's seat?

513
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:25,782
I was wondering why
everything's in pieces. They cut it up.

514
00:46:35,235 --> 00:46:39,486
But why are you so hung up on
Jang Hwa Sa's retrial?

515
00:46:39,487 --> 00:46:41,733
Isn't Gi Chan Sung's case more urgent?

516
00:46:42,302 --> 00:46:47,252
I'm not asking to get info.

517
00:46:47,253 --> 00:46:50,663
I'm really just very curious.

518
00:46:50,664 --> 00:46:56,623
Is there a connection between
Gi Chan Sung's case and this case?

519
00:47:00,228 --> 00:47:01,859
No.

520
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,922
Come on, I saw that the deceased guy
in Jang Hwa Sa's case

521
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:10,181
is Chairman Gi San's half-brother,
Choo Young Bae.

522
00:47:10,182 --> 00:47:13,260
How can you tell me that
there's no connection?

523
00:47:14,922 --> 00:47:17,060
Maybe there is no connection.

524
00:47:17,061 --> 00:47:20,084
Yeah, let's just say that
it's a coincidence.

525
00:47:20,085 --> 00:47:22,576
Why are you digging into it
when it won't get you any money?

526
00:47:22,577 --> 00:47:24,813
You just need to fill
the community hours.

527
00:47:32,750 --> 00:47:35,632
A long time ago...

528
00:47:36,483 --> 00:47:44,483
there was a time when a day would
last forever. I was so afraid of time.

529
00:47:46,342 --> 00:47:49,422
I memorized books, word for word.

530
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:52,543
I would memorize poems...

531
00:47:53,391 --> 00:47:55,925
novels...

532
00:47:56,697 --> 00:47:58,898
the Bible...

533
00:48:00,152 --> 00:48:02,432
and Buddhist scriptures.

534
00:48:04,155 --> 00:48:06,447
When did you have time
to study for the bar exam?

535
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:16,485
A tiny woman like an ash tree.

536
00:48:18,853 --> 00:48:24,701
A woman who would be nothing
if she weren't a woman.

537
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:29,614
A woman like sadness.

538
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,538
An unfortunate woman.

539
00:48:37,648 --> 00:48:39,179
She...

540
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:45,134
reminded me of myself.

541
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:48,967
She reminded me of Jang Hwa Sa.

542
00:48:50,731 --> 00:48:58,731
What Jang Hwa Sa did
was so funny and pathetic.

543
00:49:19,938 --> 00:49:21,617
Seriously...

544
00:49:33,509 --> 00:49:35,765
"Mental Wrecker."

545
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:37,341
"Crocodile."

546
00:49:37,342 --> 00:49:39,249
What else was there?

547
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:43,385
Oh... "Crazy Eulji."

548
00:49:46,552 --> 00:49:50,139
I guess none of those nicknames
are fitting for you.

549
00:49:53,021 --> 00:49:59,179
Perhaps everyone is mistaken about you.

550
00:49:59,867 --> 00:50:01,699
Just like I was.

551
00:50:25,039 --> 00:50:28,649
<i>SHC Group's Chairman Gi San
has donated 100 billion won</i>

552
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:32,694
<i>to the "Dream & Challenge"
to help young entrepreneurs.</i>

553
00:50:32,695 --> 00:50:33,783
100 billion?

554
00:50:33,784 --> 00:50:36,996
I guess money is like paper to him.

555
00:50:40,054 --> 00:50:44,096
It's too bad the first thing you learned
after graduating from school is drinking.

556
00:50:44,097 --> 00:50:48,728
It's bad if you get drunk.
What if people find out?

557
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:56,236
<i>My son's unfortunate accident and
"Dream & Challenge" are unrelated.</i>

558
00:50:56,237 --> 00:50:58,132
I can't stand him.

559
00:51:00,382 --> 00:51:02,824
- Who's here?
- It's so early.

560
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,619
This way.

561
00:51:10,777 --> 00:51:13,256
We're a little late because
there was traffic, Attorney.

562
00:51:13,257 --> 00:51:15,012
- We will set everything up.
- Okay.

563
00:51:23,391 --> 00:51:27,160
Attorney Eulji goes for
the sophisticated look.

564
00:51:27,161 --> 00:51:30,257
Let's go with
2018's fall and winter haute couture...

565
00:51:32,179 --> 00:51:35,047
We'll go with the white bag...

566
00:51:35,048 --> 00:51:37,030
Black and white.

567
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:42,750
- Aren't the jewels so pretty?
- Yes...

568
00:51:45,382 --> 00:51:47,609
<i>- What?
- Come here.</i>

569
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,679
Let's go talk.

570
00:51:56,222 --> 00:52:01,212
You're so much greater than I'd thought.

571
00:52:01,213 --> 00:52:04,301
Get them out. We can't afford to do this.

572
00:52:04,302 --> 00:52:07,946
Hwa Sa, you were drunk
and talking in your sleep.

573
00:52:07,947 --> 00:52:12,045
"I need to become Eulji Hae Yi."
"I must become Eulji Hae Yi."

574
00:52:15,606 --> 00:52:19,612
You think you can become her
just by memorizing Gi Chan Sung's case?

575
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:24,120
Here, look.

576
00:52:24,121 --> 00:52:25,991
This is you.

577
00:52:25,992 --> 00:52:28,991
If you don't live as Eulji Hae Yi
from head to toe

578
00:52:28,992 --> 00:52:32,245
nobody will believe that you are her.

579
00:52:32,246 --> 00:52:33,984
And you'll never become her.

580
00:52:33,985 --> 00:52:35,468
It's not just about the career.

581
00:52:35,469 --> 00:52:38,756
What she eats, what she wears,
and how she spends money...

582
00:52:38,757 --> 00:52:41,678
You need to accept everything.

583
00:52:41,679 --> 00:52:46,146
That's the only way
you can become Eulji Hae Yi.

584
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:01,892
That one.

585
00:53:01,893 --> 00:53:03,789
Those slacks too.

586
00:53:05,885 --> 00:53:07,995
- You need to pick something too.
- That...

587
00:53:07,996 --> 00:53:09,496
The top.

588
00:53:09,721 --> 00:53:12,780
Oh my goodness, you need to take that.

589
00:53:15,364 --> 00:53:17,017
This?

590
00:53:17,018 --> 00:53:20,505
You look better with bigger jewels.

591
00:54:01,873 --> 00:54:04,529
Nice going...

592
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:06,530
It's a complete mess.

593
00:54:06,818 --> 00:54:10,505
I knew this would happen without me.
It's my case after all.

594
00:54:13,059 --> 00:54:15,442
You'll be in trouble, Ma Hyun Cheol

595
00:54:15,443 --> 00:54:18,057
if you get on Chairman Gi San's bad side.

596
00:54:21,983 --> 00:54:23,819
Ma Hyun Cheol...

597
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:27,147
Yeah, Ma Hyun Cheol.

598
00:54:27,148 --> 00:54:29,429
<i>Your meeting is already over?</i>

599
00:54:30,496 --> 00:54:32,565
Why is she talking so loud?

600
00:54:43,833 --> 00:54:49,530
What are you doing here?

601
00:54:49,914 --> 00:54:54,832
Oh, I came to get an insulin shot.

602
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:57,184
Why would you come into
my office to do that?

603
00:54:58,144 --> 00:55:00,699
- I'm sorry.
- Get out right now!

604
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:08,926
Seriously, what the hell
is going on today?

605
00:55:08,927 --> 00:55:11,135
Coming in here without permission...

606
00:55:16,922 --> 00:55:19,138
<i>Sheryl Sandberg once said</i>

607
00:55:19,139 --> 00:55:22,249
<i>Even if we miss out on
the best option, "A"</i>

608
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:24,921
<i>we need to continue to live on.</i>

609
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:28,814
<i>We all have Option B left.</i>

610
00:55:28,815 --> 00:55:31,348
<i>Yeah, Ma Hyun Cheol.</i>

611
00:55:31,349 --> 00:55:35,001
<i>He's my Option B right now.</i>

612
00:55:48,713 --> 00:55:50,584
Attorney.

613
00:55:50,585 --> 00:55:53,393
Are you ready?

614
00:55:53,914 --> 00:55:55,556
Let's go.

615
00:56:04,628 --> 00:56:06,233
Good morning!

616
00:56:23,331 --> 00:56:25,017
Who's she?

617
00:56:25,018 --> 00:56:27,082
A special hire.

618
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,246
Brought in by the boss.

619
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,651
<i>She'll be Attorney Eulji's secretary
and research assistant starting today.</i>

620
00:56:33,652 --> 00:56:36,756
Attorney Eulji is standing on
shaky ground to begin with.

621
00:56:36,757 --> 00:56:39,818
She hasn't been to work in a week,
and she brings along that housewife?

622
00:56:49,166 --> 00:56:52,233
Oh, sweet coffee?

623
00:56:52,949 --> 00:56:55,250
I'm in charge of making
Attorney Eulji's coffee.

624
00:56:55,251 --> 00:56:57,696
She likes her morning coffee
while she's in her meeting.

625
00:56:57,697 --> 00:57:01,949
From today, I'll make her coffee.
You can just go and relax.

626
00:57:02,949 --> 00:57:06,556
- How do you know Attorney Eulji?
- She's... Big Boss.

627
00:57:06,557 --> 00:57:08,847
Don't call her that while you're here.

628
00:57:09,750 --> 00:57:13,294
It's not about age, it's about power.

629
00:57:13,295 --> 00:57:15,800
You should know better, right?

630
00:57:23,175 --> 00:57:25,964
Yeah, fine...

631
00:57:25,965 --> 00:57:29,065
Sweets are the best for stress.

632
00:57:33,425 --> 00:57:35,958
Oh, no, no, no, no!

633
00:57:40,340 --> 00:57:41,879
What are you doing?

634
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:44,335
You have to be careful
when you have rosacea.

635
00:57:44,336 --> 00:57:47,731
Hot drinks, spicy foods, caffeine...
Oh, no.

636
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,728
So hot.

637
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:59,726
That woman's got skills
at pissing people off!

638
00:58:01,242 --> 00:58:04,797
Let's see...
Which one is for our attorney?

639
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:07,553
What's this?

640
00:58:07,554 --> 00:58:10,613
Mailbox 145 from Cheongwon Post Office.

641
00:58:10,614 --> 00:58:13,049
What's wrong with this address?

642
00:58:13,050 --> 00:58:15,923
Cheongwon Prison.
Jang Hwa Sa.

643
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:19,259
This is Attorney Eulji's, it must
have gotten in there by accident.

644
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:21,656
Wait, what do you think you're doing?

645
00:58:21,657 --> 00:58:24,487
How dare you touch
the managing director's mail?

646
00:58:38,726 --> 00:58:42,317
Can you call Bang Sang Soo? I need to ask
him something about Gi Chan Sung case.

647
00:58:42,318 --> 00:58:44,049
That's not what's important.

648
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:46,949
Eulji Hae Yi sent a letter
to Ma Hyun Cheol.

649
00:58:47,786 --> 00:58:49,599
What?

650
00:58:57,762 --> 00:59:01,042
Yeah, Attorney Eulji. Welcome.

651
00:59:01,043 --> 00:59:03,639
I was about to call you in.

652
00:59:05,393 --> 00:59:07,193
Would you like some breakfast?

653
00:59:09,152 --> 00:59:11,242
Sure.

654
00:59:24,121 --> 00:59:26,193
I'm sure you're appalled too.

655
00:59:31,614 --> 00:59:35,938
Why would Jang Hwa Sa write to me?

656
00:59:36,931 --> 00:59:40,241
She's very unhappy about
how the retrial was rejected.

657
00:59:40,242 --> 00:59:42,601
I couldn't help her much.

658
00:59:43,465 --> 00:59:45,407
I'll take care of that.

659
00:59:53,512 --> 00:59:58,023
You seem to know what
Jang Hwa Sa wrote in this letter.

660
01:00:03,250 --> 01:00:07,106
It says that your body's
been switched with hers.

661
01:00:07,811 --> 01:00:10,980
It's shenanigans to believe this, but...

662
01:00:10,981 --> 01:00:16,445
it's way too detailed to think of it
as a crazy bitch's talk.

663
01:00:19,505 --> 01:00:22,293
Are you really...

664
01:00:23,284 --> 01:00:25,885
Jang Hwa Sa?
