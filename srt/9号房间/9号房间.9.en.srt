Hey punk, let me go home.

Don't you know the 52-hour law?

Let's at least check on him!

00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:55,210
Hey punk, what about the Chief's permission?

12
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,010
- Geez, Team Leader.
- Slow down a little.

Okay.

He was looking for ice and towels,

51
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,220
so I said we didn't have any. Those are personal supplies.

52
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,830
So where did he go?

53
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,720

Tomorrow's Chan Sung's trial, yet...

it looks like you have a lot of free time.

64
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,950
I heard Jang Hwa Sa was dying, so...

65
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,430
I'll stop the car for a moment.

66
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,620
Since this was before the opening...

67
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,840
I thought the security cams were off for the VIP clients.

68
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:22,270
I guess you have a naive side.

69
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:25,670
This clip can't be given to Detective Oh Bong Sam, right?

70
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,740
Whether it gets disposed is up to you.

00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:23,670
If you can't get my son acquitted as promised,

72
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:26,060
you'll be standing in that courtroom instead...

00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,620

74
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,560
I know.

75
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,180
But CEO,

76
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:40,300
why were you at the hospital?

77
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,130
Must you know why?

78
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:48,330
It would look strange to anyone.

79
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:53,760
I went to see the inmate who killed my half-brother.

80
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,030
I heard she was dying, so...

81
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,060
I wanted to see her face.

82
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,770
Where the heck did she go?

83
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,880
I'm more curious about her whereabouts!

84
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,530
Tomorrow's the trial. Does it make sense that she's MIA?

85
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,160
- Of course, it doesn't make sense.
- Oh, my!

86
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:27,160
Director's about to flip out right now!

87
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,470
Bang Sang Soo, why are you worried about Director?

88
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:35,070
Bring the Prosecutor's strategy docs. I'll review them again.

89
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,910
And bring me all materials from the first trial.

90
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,160
- Yes.
- Understood.

91
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:55,990
What happened?

92
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:57,480
I was dying of anxiety.

93
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,160
Until Oh Bong Sam called and said he had your purse,

94
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,300
I thought you were arrested.

95
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:05,020
- Kang Mi Ran...
- Unnie, you got your wish.

96
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,600
We found it.

97
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,970
It'll be possible to see...

98
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:11,630
Ki Chang Sung getting cuffed in front of Ki San.

99
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,580
This means the game's over, right?

100
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,950
What are you talking about?

101
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,640
How could you just leave...

102
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,280
You're Hae Yi, right?

103
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,610
You're Hae Yi, aren't you?

104
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,210
You were changed back, right?

105
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,990
It was successful, right?

00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:12,440
I'm very sorry.

112
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,660
But that's not possible.

113
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,220
That's not possible.

114
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,330
Me, Hae Yi, Jang Hwa Sa, and the defibrillator.

115
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,160
If I was really Hae Yi,

116
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:27,060
wouldn't we be hugging and shedding tears of joy?

117
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,320
Why is Ki San's brother so serious?

118
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,670
Finish your story about Ki Chan Sung.

119
00:15:01,670 --> 00:15:04,930
I found a clip of Morgan Kim going over to...

120
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,440
Ki San's house.

121
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,550
Where is it? Give it to me.

122
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:10,520
At home.

123
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:15,930
- What is it? <i>- Director's asking for you.</i>

124
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:17,340
Okay.

125
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:21,060
Han Yeon Hee, go to Jo Eun Police Dept. and get my bag...

126
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,000
from Detective Oh Bong Sam.

127
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:28,430
Are you sure they're in a relationship?

128
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,980
For a long time, now.

129
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,690
My guess is that they went somewhere yesterday

130
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:35,010
and got into an argument.

131
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:39,570
I mean, how can this be when the second trial's tomorrow?

132
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,970
Is there a problem?

133
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:57,450
Not a problem, exactly.

134
00:15:57,450 --> 00:15:59,670
But it's an unexpected "two-shot."

135
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,330
Bang Sang Soo.

136
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,650
Why aren't you leaving?

137
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,140
Okay.

138
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,370
What are you doing?

139
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,680
It must be hard for a bat.

140
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:27,460
Should I join this side? Or that side?

141
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,770
Plotting, collaborating, alienating people.

142
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:32,810
Not everyone can do this.

143
00:16:36,110 --> 00:16:37,260
What is he saying?

144
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:41,770
You being absent before Chan Sung's trial.

145
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,300
How should I take this?

146
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:50,940
I'm not sure how I should take it.

147
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,270
Anyone can have an 80% victory rate,

148
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:59,520
if you're talented or work harder than others.

149
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,690
For a 90% victory rate, politics are necessary.

150
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:06,370
You need your firm's support.

151
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,860
It's at times like this when partners can shine.

152
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,330
But...

153
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:15,800
I'm 100% victory rate, Eulji Hae Yi.

154
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,740
So?

155
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,950
It's a good thing that you were a Busan Prosecutor, right?

156
00:17:22,950 --> 00:17:27,900
If you were in Seoul, you would've had to watch me stomp on your hoobaes and...

157
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,810
it would've been upsetting.

158
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,850
I see.

159
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:36,830
There's a saying for times like this.

160
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:39,950
"Just sit back and enjoy the ride."

161
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,920
"Enjoy the show and eat the rice cakes?"

162
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:47,850
I hope the rice cake you're making...

163
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,880
is tasty.

164
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:57,580
Attorney Eulji asked you to come and get this?

165
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:00,340
Of course. Why else would I come?

166
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,540
It wasn't a lost item, so you don't need any forms, right?

167
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:10,100
I'm losing my mind.

168
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,500
Did she put on a show to mock me?

169
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,890
- Kidnap?
- Yes.

170
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:18,070
- You said she was kidnapped.
- Yes.

171
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:22,240
Murder, threats, kidnapping. What a joke. Aigoo.

172
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,820
I'm confused, too.

173
00:18:29,030 --> 00:18:30,240
Geez.

174
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,470
Ddaeng Chil's asking for a payment.

175
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:24,490
She worked hard. Shouldn't we give her some?

176
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,930
I don't have any money.

177
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,450
What do you mean?

178
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:30,000
Your monthly salary's over 90 million won.

179
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,560
What will you do with everything in the safe?

180
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,980
The money and the jewels.

181
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,300
Give me a cut and Ddaeng Chil, too.

182
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,270
Hey!

183
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:39,510
Unnie, it's all yours now.

184
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:42,950
Eulji Hae Yi is you and you're Eulji Hae Yi.

185
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,800
Okay. Play it.

186
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:14,540
Wait.

187
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,650
Pause right there.

188
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,400
Doesn't she deserve a payment for this?

189
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:26,670
Yes, I'll pay.

190
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,810
A lot.

191
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,210
You guys are truly amazing.

192
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,800
You must have a lot on your mind.

193
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,970
When the sun comes up...

194
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,810
it'll be Chan Sung's second trial.

195
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,310
You should be by Chan Sung's side, too.

196
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,210
He has you, Hyungnim.

197
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,660
There's someone else I need to take care of.

198
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,160
What are you doing?

199
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,870
I'll scrub your back.

200
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,580
Aren't you leaving?

201
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:12,950
You'd asked me to bathe together to conserve water.

202
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:20,140
I have a lot on my mind because of the trial.

203
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,940
Hey.

204
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,990
Everything we've investigated so far...

205
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,220
Can you print them out for me?

206
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,760
Now?

207
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:29,940
Yeah.

208
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:43,480
It's nice to dry my hair like this instead of with a fan.

209
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,620
It's refreshing.

210
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,950
The outside world is a good place.

211
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,740
And even better if you have money.

212
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,720
Judge, Prosecutor, they're all professionals. You sure you can do this trial?

213
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:56,860
Why?

214
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,290
You don't think I can?

215
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:02,380
Whoa, you're so confident! You really look like Eulji Hae Yi.

216
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,540
This is what we've investigated.

217
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,760
<i>They're here!</i>

218
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,740
CEO, do you still think your son is innocent?

219
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:53,930
Hey, Lawyer.

220
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,630
You'll be relieved after the trial.

221
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,440
- CEO, what are your thoughts?
- CEO, please answer the question.

222
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,710
I am a father believing in his son's innocence.

223
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,780
Let's go.

224
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:05,710
Of course, he's not guilty.

225
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,850
The first trial already gave us this verdict.

226
00:24:07,850 --> 00:24:11,300
Lately, it's been difficult for the rich and the powerful.

227
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,440
The underdogs are no joke.

228
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,570
This is a...

229
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:17,850
case of underdogs taking aim at the conglomerates,

230
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,350
and the Prosecutors walking on eggshells.

231
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:22,210
This is just a happening.

232
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:31,280
Case number 2017-1865.

233
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:37,660
Let's begin the second trial for the Hyojadong pedestrian murder case.

234
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:40,800
Witness, during the first trial...

235
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,700
you stated you didn't notice anything strange about the vehicle, while in the car.

236
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,300
Is this correct?

237
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,180
Yes, that's correct.

238
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:54,770
To go to Hyojadong from the defendant's home in Seongbukdong,

239
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:59,130
<i>you pass by Seoul's famous S-shaped Yeonsu road.</i>

240
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:02,430
<i>It's approximately 1.2 km downhill.</i>

241
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:05,440
You went down this road on the day of the incident?

242
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,980
Yes, that's correct.

243
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,890
Whoa, s***!

244
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,430
What? What is it?

245
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,080
<i>What?</i>

246
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,260
There are multiple symptoms of a faulty brake hose.

247
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,920
The brakes slip or pulsate,

248
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,500
poor break response,

249
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,090
or there's sounds of air deflating.

250
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:36,610
These symptoms escalate when going downhill.

251
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:42,520
Why didn't the witness feel any of this?

252
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:43,950
Witness?

253
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,230
Do you know the term "butler friend"?

254
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:54,750
"Butler friend."

255
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:57,250
I know that term very well.

256
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:01,880
From Elementary school until now...

257
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,320
I've heard it more than enough times.

258
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,950
Perhaps the witness couldn't feel any of this

259
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:12,690
because there weren't any issues with the brakes?

260
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,320
I rest my case.

261
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,650
Attorney, please state your defense.

262
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,690
Witness.

263
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:24,250
Does the defendant like K-pop girl groups?

264
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:25,970
What?

265
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,300
You said you're his butler friend.

266
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,640
Everyone here heard it, "butler friend."

267
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:33,270
No, he doesn't.

268
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:37,020
Chan Sung's not interested in girl or boy groups.

269
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,680
Oh, what a shame.

270
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,250
Idol groups are Korea's pride and joy.

271
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,770
Then let's forget the idol groups.

272
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:45,370
What song was playing in the car that day?

273
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,630
It was "So What" by Serious.

274
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:51,480
The car's audio system is better than any clubs.

275
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:56,730
The speakers are by Ground Zero Corp.

276
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:00,820
The sound system was meant to mimic a nightclub.

277
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,850
They're in their 20's.

278
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:06,360
When the brakes were pressed, the car would've shook.

279
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,990
But if you're blasting music on that system,

280
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:11,030
it'd be impossible to feel any symptoms.

281
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:16,720
The reason why the witness couldn't feel any issues.

282
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,220
Need I say more?

283
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,790
Your attention please.

284
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:52,670
SHC Group's CEO Ki San will now make a toast.

285
00:27:54,070 --> 00:27:57,660
After the sentencing trial a week from now,

286
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,330
Chan Sung will finally be...

287
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:02,610
returning to school.

288
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:09,670
Tickets have been purchased. One-way, of course.

289
00:28:09,670 --> 00:28:12,180
Let's celebrate our victory in advance.

290
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:14,340
Here's to Chan Sung!

291
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,710
Cheers!

292
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,730
Go and greet everyone.

293
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,390
Why the long face?

294
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:32,530
At the last party...

295
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,080
Director Ma was here.

296
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,320
The void is so big.

297
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,920
He died in a grotesque way,

298
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,880
but who doesn't die?

299
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:46,860
You'll be maintaining your victory rate.

300
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,870
Congratulations!

301
00:28:47,870 --> 00:28:49,670
Aigoo! Aigoo. I'm sorry.

302
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,940
My apologies.

303
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,520
I got too excited.

304
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:04,050
Attorney Eulji, you were amazing today.

305
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,420
Perfect.

306
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:10,910
CEO, I'd like to discuss my victory compensation.

307
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:13,520
You certainly don't hesitate.

308
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:15,440
Victory compensation is good.

309
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,280
Isn't victory compensation the best money to spend?

310
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,740
This...

311
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,520
Where did you...

312
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,840
Who did you get this from?

313
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,330
Continue watching.

314
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,540
This...

315
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,200
Where did you...

316
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,540
Who did you get this from?

317
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,060
Continue watching.

318
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:04,990
<i>Kitty.</i>

319
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:08,020
Chang Sung must like cats.

320
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,420
Meow, meow. <i>Here kitty.</i>

321
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:14,360
He's calling a cat, right?

322
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,500
What is it that you want?

323
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,870
Debt relief.

324
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:20,530
My lifeline which you're holding.

325
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:23,290
Please destroy the original footage from the resort.

326
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:25,380
And the copies as well.

327
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,990
I will.

328
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:31,700
Now I have nothing to do with Director Ma's death.

329
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,440
CEO, your mission of the...

330
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:37,150
formal sentencing trial remains, but I already won the case.

331
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,020
I'll throw this in as a bonus.

332
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:48,930
I'll ask you one more time.

333
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,810
Where did you get this?

334
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:54,150
It's my rule to not expose the source.

335
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:58,960
CEO, you owe me a bonus, too.

336
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,360
Senior Partner.

337
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,780
Director Ma promised me when he was alive.

338

Much congrats.

341
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,200
Thank you.

342
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,270
So...

343
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,850
were you playing around with me?

344
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:32,700
Huh?

345
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:35,270
Riding behind me and holding on for dear life.

346
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:38,180
Inviting me to eat chicken soup with Jang Hwa Sa's mother.

347
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,630
Was it all a joke?

348
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:47,250
Detective Oh Bong Sam, you must've liked me.

349
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:48,920
So unexpected.

350
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,940
How can you fall for someone so fast?

351
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,510
What?

352
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,060
Wow, geez.

353
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:00,690
Were you messing with me the whole time?

354
00:32:00,690 --> 00:32:04,060
Because I suspected you of Ma Hyun Cheol's murder?

355
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,800
Or because of Ki Chan Sung?

356
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,280
I have nothing to do with Ma Hyun Cheol.

357
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,880
If you have evidence, get a formal warrant from Hyeseungpo police.

358
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,270
And as for Ki Chan Sung's case...

359
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:17,870
I have no reason to use my charms on you.

360
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,800
You wench!

361
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,530
Then why did you confuse me?

00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:34,400
I didn't come out so I can ask you to take care of me.

545
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,930
Because I have something to do.

546
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:40,330
Before I die...

547
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:44,160
there's something I must do.

548
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,920
Secretary Kam.

549
00:47:58,920 --> 00:48:00,360
Your fashion is, hahaha!

550
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,240
Are you skipping work and going on your honeymoon?

551
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,210
Vacation. Bali.

552
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:06,200
Massage. Travel.

553
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,950
Massage? You're lucky.

554
00:48:08,950 --> 00:48:10,250
The sentencing trial isn't over yet.

555
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:12,970
I'm not a full-timer. I'm Attorney Eulji's personal secretary.

556
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:14,520
Hey, who is this?

557
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,430
Aren't you Hee?

558
00:48:16,430 --> 00:48:17,720
Hee!

559
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,900
Do you know regretful I am and how long I've been looking for you?

560
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:22,290
I'm sorry.

561
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:23,710
You weren't asking for Kim Joong Bae's diamond,

562
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:26,590
but just a tiny little jewel.

563
00:48:26,590 --> 00:48:28,680
Hey, what is Hee?

564
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:30,990
- Do you know this grandpa?
- How would I know him?

565
00:48:30,990 --> 00:48:33,620
Grandpa, your eyes must be bad.

566
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:35,820
I'm not Hee, I'm Kam Mi Ran.

567
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:38,900
No, no. I'm positive you're my Hee.

568
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,910
And I'm your Hoon.

569
00:48:40,910 --> 00:48:43,960
I'll buy you everything. Everything you want.

570
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,320
Red, blue diamonds, I'll buy you all of them.

571
00:48:46,320 --> 00:48:47,870
Why this grandpa...

572
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:51,310
You must have Alzheimer's instead. I said, I'm Kam Mi Ran.

573
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,050
Do you see that over there?

574
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:55,100
The top law firm in our country.

575
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,810
I'm a secretary there.

576
00:48:56,810 --> 00:48:59,820
Attorney, let's go. I'll buy you some meat.

577
00:49:03,370 --> 00:49:04,950
But I'm sure she's Hee.

578
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:13,870
I asked them to heat this up.

579
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,580
So...

580
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,020
I'm...

581
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:20,050
a bat, a bat.

582
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:21,140
A bat?

583
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,510
What else can I do?

584
00:49:23,510 --> 00:49:27,070
An underdog must get on the right side.

585
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:29,610
Being on the right side determines one's life.

586
00:49:29,610 --> 00:49:31,450
You're a disgrace.

587
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:32,580
Not 80 years...

588
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:33,820
not 100 years...

589
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:35,910
but he says he'll live to be 120 years old...

590
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:37,680
what am I going to do for a living?

591
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:38,720
Huh?

592
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,410
There's a surplus of lawyers in this world.

593
00:49:47,560 --> 00:49:49,270
Let me ask you something.

594
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:51,630
Go ahead or don't...

595
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:53,050
I'm...

596
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:56,130
have to stand in Kim Jong Soo's line...

597
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,570
or the one who hit a solo homerun ball...

598
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:03,240
and saved Ki Chan Sung, Attorney Eul?

599
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:05,630
Of course, it's our attorney.

600
00:50:05,630 --> 00:50:06,890
Of course...

601
00:50:06,890 --> 00:50:08,310
Of course...

602
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:11,220
She made senior partner.

603
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,330
She's going to marry Sir Ki...

604
00:50:13,330 --> 00:50:14,580
Yes, she will.

605
00:50:14,580 --> 00:50:17,770
Reply with sincerity.

606
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,930
Will you?

607
00:50:19,930 --> 00:50:21,820
I did reply with sincerity.

608
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,140
Hey...

609
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:26,230
if you look here...

610
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:27,840
haha!

611
00:50:27,840 --> 00:50:31,170
Well, a chili pepper...

612
00:50:31,170 --> 00:50:33,650
Why is a chili pepper in here?

613
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:35,540
Walk straight!

614
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:37,820
Walk, walk.

615
00:50:37,820 --> 00:50:39,670
I'm so tired.

616
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,760
Why does a Damjang attorney

617
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,350
live in a study room?

618
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:48,680
Seriously.

619
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:53,370
Geez! Seriously!

620
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:55,100
Get up, get up!

621
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:58,490
I said, get up!

622
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:06,370
Where's your home?

623
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:09,990
I have to pee.

624
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:13,290
Just lay down!

625
00:51:22,930 --> 00:51:24,120
My goodness...

626
00:51:28,110 --> 00:51:30,940
You're so pitiful...

627
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,780
You reek of pity...

628
00:51:57,710 --> 00:51:59,085
<i>[ If you want to become a full-time employee, stand behind Kim Jong Soo. ]</i>

629
00:51:59,085 --> 00:52:00,340
<i>[ Attorney Eulji and Ki Yoo Jin are 100% going to break up. ]</i>

630
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:04,230
<i>If you want to become a full-time employee, stand behind Kim Jong Soo.</i>

631
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:07,680
<i>Attorney Eulji and Ki Yoo Jin are 100% going to break up.</i>

632
00:52:21,830 --> 00:52:24,020
We're closed.

633
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:25,980
Ddaeng Chil.

634
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,440
We're closed.

635
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:37,710
Ddaeng Chil.

636
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:42,430
What b**** is bringing up my past?

637
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:52,410
Unnie!

638
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,390
I must be dreaming.

639
00:52:59,390 --> 00:53:02,440
I can't believe I'm seeing my Big Unnie here! Unnie!

640
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,900
Umm...

641
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,520
let's exchange greetings later.

642
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,480
Where is Pal Pal?

643
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,270
I can't get a hold of her.

644
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:12,480
I heard she's going on a trip.

645
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,260
She got a bonus and vacation time.

646
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,980
We were heading out on vacation, too.

647
00:53:20,940 --> 00:53:21,920
Ddaeng Chil...

648
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:25,140
don't listen to anyone...

649
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:28,020
except for me.

650
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,510
Can you do that?

651
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,170
Of course.

652
00:53:33,170 --> 00:53:34,610
By any chance...

653
00:53:34,610 --> 00:53:37,720
the footage you found of Morgan Kim...

654
00:53:38,990 --> 00:53:39,980
do you have it?

655
00:53:39,980 --> 00:53:42,160
It was absolutely daebak.

656
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,370
We found it in a car black box.

657
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:45,550
Where is it?

658
00:53:45,550 --> 00:53:47,740
Pal Pal unni probably gave it to the attorney.

659
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:50,790
Unnie?

660
00:53:50,790 --> 00:53:52,210
Unnie!

661
00:53:52,210 --> 00:53:54,160
Unnie, are you okay?

662
00:53:55,450 --> 00:53:57,970
I can recover the footage on my computer.

663
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:15,400
The salad is ready.

664
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,420
Potato!

665
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,300
Is this a decalcomania or deja vu?

666
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:29,330
This is exactly what I did for your birthday.

667
00:54:29,330 --> 00:54:31,430
That's when things started to go sour

668
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:35,620
so let's go back to that day and make things right.

669
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:40,830
How is it?

670
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:42,050
It's really buttery.

671
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:43,560
It must be fattening.

672
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:45,850
But... it's really good.

673
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:48,410
I have to lose weight.

674
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:51,790
Jang Hwa Sa ate everything carbs and everything in sight

675
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,920
so my body's a mess.

676
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,520
- What do I do?
- It's okay.

677
00:54:57,590 --> 00:54:58,800
Is it good?

678
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:11,510
Eat up.

679
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:13,140
I know you're going to start dieting tomorrow.

680
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:15,460
I'm being careful not to swallow the ring.

681
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:19,360
Do you think my imagination is lacking?

682
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:25,480
Do you think it's Kang Mi Ran or Pal Pal?

683
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,450
Yoo Jin!

684
00:56:00,970 --> 00:56:03,710
You have one wild imagination.

685
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,350
Noona!

686
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:13,560
Why are you scaring me?

687
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,430
Why are you making my heart drop?

688
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:17,920
Are you upset?

689
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,700
Don't be mad.

690
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,700
I didn't think this through.

691
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:26,170
I'll explain everything.

692
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,840
Why he sent this to me...

693
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:42,160
I didn't get to hear why from Director Ma...

694
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,220
but I learned about a lot of things.

695
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:49,830
I saw my mother's face...

696
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,670
You met your mom?

697
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:54,390
Let's talk about that later.

698
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:57,010
Noona, it must be a bad memory for you.

699
00:56:58,700 --> 00:56:59,940
No, it's not.

700
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:02,850
It was a time of reflection for me.

701
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:21,630
I've waited too long, Hae Yi.

702
00:59:39,390 --> 00:59:42,660
If he figures it out, I continue on...

703
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:45,040
If he doesn't...

704
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,320
then I'll stop right there.

705
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:00,480
Director Ma passed away.

706
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,800
Who sent this?

707
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:06,850
What are they trying to do?

708
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,100
Yoo Jin...

709
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:13,370
I'm getting goosebumps...

710
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:22,290
Defendant Ki Chan Sung,

711
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:25,600
drove into the intersection and killed two people.

712
01:00:25,600 --> 01:00:30,240
He also injured two others.

713
01:01:05,290 --> 01:01:06,740
However,

714
01:01:06,740 --> 01:01:11,260
the accident was due to uncontrollable circumstances

715
01:01:11,260 --> 01:01:14,040
and the vehicle's maintenance was performed by a third party.

716
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:17,410
Considering that the defendant did his part to maintain the vehicle in working condition

717
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:19,810
I sentence the following.

718
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,720
Judge, wait a minute!

719
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,510
This incident wasn't an accident.

720
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:25,800
This was pre-meditated to kill Morgan Kim!

721
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,500
What?

722
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,100
I have evidence.

723
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:34,660
You can't submit new evidence during a trial!

724
01:01:54,066 --> 01:02:28,900
