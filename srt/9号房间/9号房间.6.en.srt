Pizza, pizza.

188
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,450
Two slices of pizza.

189

Hey, what the.

206
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:31,330
- What are you doing?<br>- When I wake up, I empty out my stomach.

207
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,390
The start of a healthy day.

208
00:21:33,390 --> 00:21:35,530
I took a dump. Go to the first floor.

209

You have a disease?

212
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,880
Due to the stress of starting a new job,

213
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,990
I got a UTI. Infections are from bacteria.

214
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:52,980
- Go to the first floor!<br>- I said, I won't use the toilet.

215

You're right.

230

Unni, now you're...

231
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,900
on Ki San's palm.

232
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:04,400
You handed Ki San your Achilles heel.

233
00:25:04,450 --> 00:25:06,990
This is too dangerous.

234
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,700
Based on the NFS report,

235
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,080
excessive bleeding was found

236
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,200
<i>in Ma Hyun Cheol's occipital lobe.</i>

237
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,530
<i>There was a high dosage of <br>tetrodotoxin in his blood.</i>

238
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:32,110
<i>Cyanosis and facial paralysis <br>were also present.</i>

239
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:34,910
<i>Although tetrodotoxin was in his blood,</i>

240
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:38,100
<i>it's unlikely to cause death.</i>

241
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,500
<i>So the chances of a voluntary <br>manslaughter is high.</i>

242
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,450
<i>However,</i>

243
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:45,400
<i>tetrodotoxin can cause vasoconstriction</i>

244
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,730
<i>and cause excessive bleeding.</i>

245
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:51,660
<i>Because Ma Hyun Cheol <br>lost over 1,500ml of blood,</i>

246
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:56,830
<i>the direct cause is excessive bleeding <br>from trauma to the head.</i>

247
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:58,990
Hyungnim, look.

248
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,040
The Ki Chan Sung case is in progress.

249
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,220
The NFS reporter Sang Lee which

250
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,930
found him innocent, <br>died before testifying.

251
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:09,270
Then the next day, Director <br>Ma Hyun Cheol died, right?

252
00:26:09,270 --> 00:26:12,550
Yes, they were both in <br>Ki Chan Sung's boundaries.

253
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:16,130
But there's definite alibi's and no motive.

- You're not eating? I'll eat it all.<br>- We may not know the motive.

There's no evidence either. You have it?

I always go to a salon when I have a lot on my mind.

353
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,890
What do I do now?

354
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:35,400
Ma Hyun Cheol, who was going to get me out of here is dead.

355
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,500
It's you, isn't it?

356
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,500
Geez.

357
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:50,010
My mind is locked up as a death row inmate in Cheongwon Prison and my body...

358
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:53,470
I don't know when it'll get arrested for murder.

359
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:57,640
What kind of sick joke is this?

360
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,780
Why are you here?

361
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,640
To brag that you killed Ma Hyun Cheol?

362
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,850
I need your help for Ki Chan Sung's second trial.

363
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:09,930
You're very thick-skinned.

364

I'll give you your body back.

366

I'll hurry and finish what I need to take care of

367
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:21,150

368

I'm going to give it back. I promise.

370
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,900
is it...

371
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,500
another murder?

372
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,980
Fine. Since there's no other option.

373
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:46,840
On one condition though.

374
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:49,330
What is it?

375
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,780
- You can go inside.<br>- Okay.

376

Doctor.

377
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,790
I'm going to lower my medication as you said

378
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:06,400
but I'm coming back tomorrow if I don't feel better.

379
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,620
Okay?

380

You're going to get better.

- Did you find it?<br>- Geez. Butterfly sleep.

386
00:37:30,010 --> 00:37:32,400
I searched the entire country.

387

Five postpartum care facilities

388
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,920
and one private care facility.

389
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,490

What the heck?

400
00:38:16,050 --> 00:38:18,490
I should have double checked before we left.

401
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,350
It looks like we came to the wrong place. I'm sorry.

402
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,830

It's okay. I'm excited that you've come to take a look.

408

Doctor, are you okay?

Give me a minute alone.

414

Okay.

415
00:41:55,790 --> 00:41:58,390
Oh, my goodness.

What are you doing, Ki Chan Sung's Uncle?

417
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:03,590
I'm not sure how much work you have left but go home for the day.

I think my birth mother passed away.

Yoo Jin, who's your mother?

430
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,130
Is she connected to Jang Hwa Sa?

431

Or with CEO Ki San?

432
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:55,070
How much pain I'm in...

434
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,790

Damn b****.

00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:12,010
My feelings aren't impulsive.

451
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,790
I was going to propose after Chan Sung's trial was over.

I was going to do an event.

453

It was supposed to be a memorable proposal.

00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:29,240
Tell me about your mother first.

Attorney! Attorney!

460
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:56,690
I don't think I should be heading home already.

We have to finish preparing for the trial.

462
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:04,110
So I got on the subway and immediately hopped off.

Please forgive me?

00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:55,100
Listen and don't get mad.

473
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,330
If you want to give Chu Young Bae the perfect blow

474
00:45:58,330 --> 00:46:00,700
you should marry Ki Yoo Jin.

475
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,420
You b****.

476
00:46:03,700 --> 00:46:06,800
You shouldn't have dated Chu Young Bae

477
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:11,200
and dated the real Ki San. Then you wouldn't have to deal with all of this.

478
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:14,850
Young master Ki San,

479
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:19,380
- I've never met him before.<br>- That doesn't make sense.

480
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,920
They say Ki Se Woong sent him to study abroad.

481
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,700
The day after his elementary school graduation.

482
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:29,200
So harsh. He was just a kid.

483
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,500
He probably wanted to raise him properly

484
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:35,670
as San Hae Group's heir.

485
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:39,000
Honey, you always lose to me too.

486
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,900
I don't think he studies and plays chess all day.

487
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:50,200
- CEO?<br>- Yes, what is it?

488
00:46:58,330 --> 00:47:00,800
He's been like that for over an hour.

489
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,260
I thought I should let you know.

490
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:07,250
- Enlarge the video and be on your way. <br>- Yes, CEO.

491
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:27,780
Go check why your Uncle is out there like that.

492
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:30,920
Did he get rejected?

493
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:34,500

I still miss you.

<i>Lastly,</i>

506
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,400
<i>since Director Ma can't get me out of here</i>

507

508
00:49:38,690 --> 00:49:42,180
<i>Bring me all your files, don't leave anything out.</i>

509
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:48,000
Mmm.

510
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,260
If I knew you were going to like it this much, I should've gotten you two.

511
00:49:54,330 --> 00:49:57,570
It's all because of this damn body!

512
00:50:00,900 --> 00:50:05,800
I'm craving sweets and carbs because of the diabetes.

513
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,730
Eat slowly.

514
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:13,180
You'll get sick.

00:50:17,300 --> 00:50:18,900
So...

516
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:21,860
What do you want to know about Ki Chan Sung?

517

and if so, why?

519
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,300
Someone might think you're a prosecutor.

520

Get a hold of yourself.

00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:05,170
Park Eun Sung? Park Chul Soon's son?

531
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,600
Wow. You know a lot.

532
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:20,070
He's been friends with Chan Sung since elementary school.

533
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:24,150
He's pretty much his butler and bodyguard friend.

534
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:30,180
<i>On the 24th, the road was emptier than usual.</i>

535
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:33,160
<i>There was fog and rain.</i>

536
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,820
<i>The driving conditions weren't great </i>

537
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:37,650
<i>and it was darker than usual due to the rain.</i>

538
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:42,680
S***! What do I do?

539
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,310
Turn the handle!

540
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,700
- No!<br>- Chan Sung!!

541
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,990
I'm Oh Bong Sam.

542
00:51:56,990 --> 00:51:59,080
Why aren't you blocking off the traffic?

543
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,310
Blow.

544
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,900
Blow, you a******!

545
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:05,900
Blow as hard as you can.

546
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,400
Look at this punk.

547
00:52:08,510 --> 00:52:10,450
Take your hands out of your pocket.

548
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:16,800
Don't you see there's been an accident? Move your car.

549
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,100
I can clearly see there's been an accident.

550
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,300
That's why I was called out here.

551
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:24,400
You pressed on the gas pedal

552
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:27,800
with all your strength but why can't you blow? S***!

553
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:32,400
- What are you doing?<br>- Are you family of the suspect?

554
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,500
Older sister?

555
00:52:33,500 --> 00:52:35,070
Mom?

556
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:36,890
Who are you calling a suspect?

557
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:39,230
Nothing's been proven yet.

558
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:43,140
Ki Chan Sung.

559
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:46,510
- Dad must have sent you.<br>- Don't say a word.

560
00:52:48,250 --> 00:52:50,920
From this moment on, you can only speak through me.

561
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,850
I'm Ki Chan Sung's legal representative

562
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:55,060
Attorney Eulji Hae Yi.

563
00:53:02,600 --> 00:53:04,100
Damjang?

564
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:07,120
Wow. This a***** is from a family with money.

565
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,470
That explains your attitude.

566
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:13,300
Look down, a******.

567
00:53:13,300 --> 00:53:15,210
Faulty break hose.

568
00:53:15,210 --> 00:53:18,940
- Did you fabricate that?<br>One question at a time.

569
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,200
Give and take. It's my turn.

570
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,800
Here it is.

571
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:29,300
I had overlooked this, but...

572
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:34,400
Wasn't Ma Hyun Cheol your public defender at the time?

573
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,470
Why did you kill Director Ma?

574
00:53:38,470 --> 00:53:41,860
Because he knew that our bodies were switched?

575
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:43,950
Is that the only reason?

576
00:53:49,390 --> 00:53:52,470
The day our bodies were switched in this room

577
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:55,440
you saw CEO Ki San on my tablet

578
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,560
and had a heart attack?

579
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,720
Why did you call Ki San, Chu Young Bae?

580
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,070
Because they look alike?

581
00:54:03,070 --> 00:54:07,220
Even if you have a different mother, siblings can look alike.

582
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:08,760
The problem is

583
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,110
it's been 34 years.

584
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:13,450
How can you identify him with one glance?

585
00:54:13,450 --> 00:54:15,320
He's gotten old.

586
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,910
His face has completely changed.

587
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:22,450
You're remaining silent?

588
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:25,340
Fine. Let's do this another time.

589
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:27,880
During the next visit,

590
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,290
try making more of an effort.

591
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,600
I appreciate

592
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,400
you being interested in my appeals now.

593
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:42,680
But now is the time to focus on Ki Chan Sung's case.

594
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,780
Both you and I,

595
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:47,990
benefit from this.

596
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:52,210
When they close in on what happened to Director Ma

597
00:54:52,210 --> 00:54:54,720
tell me right away.

598
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:58,450
You can't handle it alone.

599
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:01,720
I'll do that.

600
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:15,300
- Is it okay?<br>- Hyung!

601
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,740
- I was on my way to look for you.<br>- Why?

602
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:24,960
The captain is furious.

603
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,380
Did you send something to the NFS?

604
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:39,730
Wow. You guys are looking good.

605
00:55:39,730 --> 00:55:43,600
You crazy a******. You should have stuck to your precinct.

606
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,800
Why were you meddling in Hyeseungpo's case?

607
00:55:46,570 --> 00:55:48,950
You sell out Jong Suh. The NFS...

608
00:55:48,950 --> 00:55:51,380
Go kill yourself!

609
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:53,150
That hurt.

610
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:56,950
Where are the results?

611
00:55:56,950 --> 00:55:58,680
Do you want me to transfer you?

612
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:02,890
If you can't get a hold of yourself even after inhaling all the fine dust

613
00:56:02,890 --> 00:56:05,680
then we'll have to send you to the police substation.

614
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:07,730
Whether you transfer me to the police substation or write me up.

615

- I'll take either after I send Ki Chan Sung to jail.<br>Hey! Bring that back!

<i>Attorney Eulji is out.</i>

617
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,150
At 7:26, she enters with Ki San.

618
00:56:37,150 --> 00:56:39,420
After that,

619
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:43,860
there's no footage of her leaving or entering.

620
00:56:51,470 --> 00:56:53,630
Byung Soo, it's me.

621
00:56:53,630 --> 00:56:55,920
I have something to ask.

622
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:58,430
I know it's against policy.

623
00:56:58,430 --> 00:57:00,780
It's really important to me.

624
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:02,690
Help me out.

625
00:57:02,690 --> 00:57:07,550
Uh huh. Did you get the fingerprints from Ma Hyun Cheol's room?

626
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,040
Whose fingerprints were they?

627

Cut the bull****.

629
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:24,360
You came because you believe <br>that I'm Eulji Hae Yi, right?

630
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,930
<i>Geez.</i>

631
00:57:26,930 --> 00:57:30,330
I'd be mad to believe it, <br>but it's unsettling not to.

00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:34,500
The signs of time

633
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:39,160
Over 30 years have passed.

634
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,400
Pause it right there.

635
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,500
Ma Hyun Cheol

636
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:54,300
Ma Hyun Cheol is careless <br>but not a fraud.

637
00:57:58,930 --> 00:58:02,280
Kang Mi Ran. She served time for fraud.

638
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:05,500
She's close to Jang Hwa Sa.

639
00:58:05,500 --> 00:58:09,610
She's currently Eulji Hae Yi's secretary.

640
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:14,500
I have to meet her.

641
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:20,280
Acrylate.

642
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:23,630
Found a trace of polyethylene.

643
00:58:23,630 --> 00:58:26,530
It looks to be of a shade of red.

644
00:58:26,530 --> 00:58:30,040
We suspect it is an ingredient of nail polish.

645
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:34,380
We were having a meeting about Ki Chan Sung's second trial.

646

<i>And 47 of them belonged to Eulji Hae Yi.</i>

Thank you for your help in Seochodong.

I was busy at the resort...

655
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,990
You got a few stitches.

656
