However...

52
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,790
the accident was due to <br>uncontrollable circumstances.

53
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,620
Plus a third party checked <br>over the vehicle, and...

54
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,960
the defendant did his part<br> to maintain the vehicle's condition.

55
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,260

and there's enough <br>evidence to support that.

117

Also, defendant Ki Chan Sung is

Fine, let's say it's a coincidence.

why didn't you say you knew her?

156
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,200
Huh?

157
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,240
Because I'd be framed for murder.

158
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,600
How could a warrant be issued for this?

160
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,090
That can't be your <br>reason for suspicion.

What ailment does Chan Sung have?

179
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:06,510
Did you know beforehand?

180
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,720
That Chan Sung knew Morgan Kim?

181
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,540
I'm Ki Chan Sung's <br>attorney, not a prosecutor.

182
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,690
I can't answer those questions.

183
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,910
Is that more important<br> than Chan Sung?

184
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:20,350
Two people are dead.

185
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:23,960
Intentional murder and <br>an accident are different.

186
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,090
If it was an accident,<br> then Chan Sung's a victim, too.

187
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:33,070
- If that's not the case...<br>- It's best if CEO and Chan Sung don't know your thoughts.

188
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,350
I went to see Chan Sung.

189
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:46,170
- Who the...<br>- CEO.

190
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,660
Who's behind this?

191
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:49,900
Yoo Jin?

192
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,980
Jang Hwa Sa? Or is it you?

193
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,990
Why the heck did you...

194
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,230
CEO, calm down.

195
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,300
How will doing this to me <br>help Chan Sung?

196
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,600
Why you!

197
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:15,200
Will you represent him <br>yourself without me?

198
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,580
So, Oh Bong Sam...

199
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:30,050
How did Oh Bong Sam...

200
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,340
bring this footage?

201
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,530
I don't know either.

202
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:38,720
I suspect that it was <br>Jang Hwa Sa's doing.

203
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,730
Where did you get...

204
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,800
this footage?

205
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:05,000
<i>Song Han Byul. <br>A grand theft convict.</i>

206
00:16:05,050 --> 00:16:07,660
<i>When Jang Hwa Sa was the<br> cook at Cheongwon Prison,</i>

207
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,020
<i>she was a cook below her.</i>

208
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:14,150
I think she found the footage <br>per Jang Hwa Sa's orders.

209
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:18,150
I confiscated it, but I <br>guess there was a copy.

210
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,040
Director Park.

211
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,000
We need a convincing explanation.

212
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:33,230
Convincing is not considered a "fact."

213
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:35,950
It's considered to be "trust."

214
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:40,800
- How prepared are you to trust me...<br>- So...

215
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,960
So what?

216
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,700
<i>Kam Mi Ran. A fraud convict.</i>

217
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,330
<i>- Geez. <br>- You're right, she's my secretary.</i>

218
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,260
Let's try again.

219
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:05,360
<i>I hired her to find out what <br>Jang Hwa Sa's hiding.</i>

220
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,200
<i>She's Jang Hwa Sa's <br>accomplice outside of prison.</i>

221
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,930
- Two, four...<br>- So...

222
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:15,720
did you find out what...

223
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,460
Jang Hwa Sa is after?

224
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:24,520
I gave up.

225
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,960
Besides killing Chu Young Bae,

226
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,670
no matter what resentment there is between your family and Jang Hwa Sa,

227
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:32,650
it's not my concern.

228
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,310
My immediate concern is <br>defending Chan Sung.

229
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:38,700
Bail request, defense strategy,<br> a "not guilty" verdict.

230
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,600
You must do that...

231
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,460
for your own sake.

232
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,000
Of course.

233
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:50,100
If you have nothing else to say, <br>I'll see you after a defense strategy's set.

234
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,700
Where is she now?

235
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,100
Jang Hwa Sa.

236
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,930
I haven't seen her since <br>courtroom #403.

237
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:29,120
What is it?

238
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,210
This is Yeon Jun Young of S-Com.

239
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,540
I'm checking your home for a break-in.

240
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,580
Okay.

241
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,200
- Aigoo, I'm sorry.<br>- No, it's okay.

242
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,860
- Have a nice evening.<br>- Okay.

243
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:45,200
Unni, when did you <br>change the passcode?

244
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:50,800
Kam Mi Ran, it ends here for you.

245
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,900
- Unni...<br>- Do you...

246
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:56,500
still think I'm Jang Hwa Sa?

247
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,540
Where's my Unni?

248
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,190
Why are you asking me?

249
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,900
Figure it out on your own.

250
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,900
Should I call the police?

251
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,040
Or will you please get lost?

252
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,380
Give me my clothes!

253
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,800
<i>Give me my clothes!</i>

254
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,300
You have a unique taste.

255
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:41,200
I had everything disposed.<br>I don't know why they left these.

256
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,980
What about my stuff? <br>My makeup, clothes, and shoes?

257
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:47,200
You should've packed it all <br>when you left for your vacation.

258
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,900
Gosh.

259
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,500
S***!

260
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,600
[ Specializing in Mudfish and Sashimi ]

261
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,950
How can you eat mudfish soup?

262
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:20,730
This place always tastes the same.

263
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:25,850
Do you know of the details of my <br>wife's pregnancy with Chan Sung?

264
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:29,740
I went to get him a name from a scholar who studies the four pillars of destiny.

265
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,260
A full moon in the center of the sky

266
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:40,420
and lighting everything around him.

267
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,560
He must live that way.

268
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,500
People and metal are alike.

269
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,160
You must be hammered in the heat to become stronger.

270
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,230
Enduring hardship brings strength.

271
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,670
You're right. Let's drink.

272
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,770
Jang Hwa Sa...

273
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,700
I must find her.

274
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:11,870
We must search local CCTV footage

275
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:15,270
can you request assistance from the Police?

276
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,600
Understood.

277
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,300
She's in the final stage of pancreatic cancer

278
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,950
why won't she just die?

279
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,860
I think...

280
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,990
Detective Han saw my face.

281
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:46,310
So run away and stay in hiding.

282
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,020
You're ill...

283
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,350
I don't feel comfortable leaving you...

284
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,450
This is all so sudden...

285
00:22:00,450 --> 00:22:02,320
This isn't much, Unni.

286
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,780
You must live a good life.

287
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,080
Why are acting like this is your final farewell?

288
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,480
Makes me sad.

289
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:23,960
I don't what the reason is, but you shouldn't mess with conglomerates.

290
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,340
Pal Pal unni should be back from her trip before you finish this.

291
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,200
I'll message her.

292
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:46,920
Don't let the Prosecutor's strategy slip by. Continue to update me.

293
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,720
<i>Yes, okay.</i>

294
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:53,560
I'm going to check before the senior partner does.

295
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,200
Move, move.

296
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,680
Come on, read my message.

297
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,830
Give me everything you know. Let something slip.

298
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:05,880
Did the Prosecutor's find a strategy?

299
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:18,980
It's about Ki Chan Sung...

300
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,130
did he intentionally run over Morgan Kim?

301
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,290
Bam!

302
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,520
I should know before I work on a defense strategy.

303
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,620
You only need facts when lowering a sentencing.

304
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,800
Because you need the know the motive, reason, and get an extenuation.

305
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,000
When you need to get a "not guilty" you don't need any of that.

306
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,310
I'm sorry.

307
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:39,800
Please guide me, Sunbae.

308
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,920
Ki Chan Sung has an illness.

309
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,920
But he's young...

310
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:46,890
Dig through his medical history and find out what medication he's taking.

311
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:50,310
Don't share this information with Han Yun Hee or the team.

312
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,470
Yes!

313
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,110
I must've lived too comfortably while in Prison.

314
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,400
I'm so tired.

315
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,380
It might be confusing because of this location,

316
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,720
but I'm not a lesbian.

317
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,980
Sure, the location is a bit strange.

318
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,660
Who stays long term at a love motel?

319
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:21,190
Take the grandma and move to a motel.

320
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:22,400
Okay.

321
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,350
Pal Pal.

322
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,800
Unni?

323
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,210
Unni.

324
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:43,200
Why did your body change with that b**** Eulji Hae Yi again?

325
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,400
I heard you got a stay of execution. Where are you ill?

326
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,910
Pal Pal...

327
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,700
Look at the state Chu Young Bae's son is in.

328
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,400
<i>The Prosecutor's opinion was accepted and the sentencing has been postponed...</i>

329
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,300
Unni, what's wrong?

330
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,350
The... the...

331
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,500
medicine Ddaeng Chil bought...

332
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:10,880
What is this?

333
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,100
It's for menstrual pain.

334
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,700
No. Unni, let's go to a hospital.

335
00:25:15,730 --> 00:25:16,990
No, I'm okay.

336
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,410
I can't die right now.

337
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,600
Before I take Chu Young Bae with me...

338
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,730
I can't die first.

339
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,740
My goodness.

340
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,750
Take the medicine then.

341
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,900
Unni!

342
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,100
Unni! Unni!

343
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,730
Pancreatic cancer.

344
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,200
It's pancreatic cancer.

345
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,800
Pancreatic cancer?

346
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,600
It can be fixed, right?

347
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,490
She can get better?

348
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,500
Multiple meta...

349
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,970
It's already spread.

350
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,310
It means nothing can be done.

351
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,000
Gosh...

352
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,300
Oppa...

353
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,200
Medical care has gotten better...

354
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,800
you can resurrect the dead...

355
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:15,900
If the Prison released her on a stay of execution

356
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,510
it means there's no hope.

357
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,110
I feel so sorry for Unni.

358
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,590
Oppa, what do I do?

359
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,660
Unni.

360
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,200
Unni!

361
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,760
Unni!

362
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,300
Unni...

363
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,970
I can pay you 320 million won.

364
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:44,190
<i>- Unni, give me some more.<br>- I can't give you more than that.</i>

365
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,900
I wasn't given my monthly or severance pay.

366
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:12,630
What is that woman doing?

367
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,940
Stealing money and

368
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,780
going to a love motel?

369
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:45,070
I have to report this right away.

370
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,800
I fired her so you don't have to worry about it.

371
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:51,550
That's what she said.

372
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:53,950
I understand the firm is chaotic because of Ki Chan Sung's case

373
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,790
but isn't this a problem, too? Stealing company funds?

374
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:58,340
Motel?

375
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,840
Not a motel, but a love motel.

376
00:28:12,210 --> 00:28:13,720
CEO.

377
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,100
I found Jang Hwa Sa.

378
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,340
She...

379
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:51,030
was supposed to be gone from this world...

380
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,020
Don't let her...

381
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:01,580
harm Chan Sung again.

382
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,300
Say ah.

383
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:08,350
Unni, you were chosen by God.

384
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,940
You experienced a miracle,

385
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:14,000
you don't think you can beat measly cancer? It's only cancer.

386
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,100
You need inner strength to beat an illness.

387
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,440
Say ah.

388
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:31,000
At the moment this is the best place to stay off Ki San's radar.

389
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,200
Why did you go to Ki Chan Sung's trial?

390
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,960
I wanted to see it with my very eyes.

391
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,810
Ki San breaking down.

392
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,770
This isn't the best place to get care.

393
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:49,600
But let's endure it, Unni.

394
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,100
Huh?

395
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,900
Ah.

396
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,900
How is it?

397
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:00,320
It's killer, isn't it?

398
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,500
I'm dead because it's delicious.

399
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:12,730
I think the lady was a dog in her past life.

400
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:14,700
How does she have such a good sense of smell?

401
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,600
Richard Gear.

402
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,430
He said Richard Gear.

403
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,900
Unni, Oppa is here.

404
00:31:35,870 --> 00:31:40,440
Add albumin, vitamins, anything to give her energy.

405
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,950
All of that is in here.

406
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,770
You're the best, Doctor.

407
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,620
Unni,

408
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:51,260
I'll go see him out.

409
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,800
<i>Where's your car?</i>

410
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,170
Who are you?

411
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,830
Oppa, put the medication on my tab.

412
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,800
Okay.

413
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:37,900
No, Unni's a patient.

414
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,430
Unni!

415
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,610
Unni! Unni! Unni!

416
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,300
Unni. Unni, wake up. Unni!

417
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,100
Unni.

418
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,740
[ Motel ]

419
00:34:34,450 --> 00:34:36,320
Why aren't you answering?

420
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,900
Unni!

421
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,840
Unni, wake up!

422
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:43,190
You can't die like this!

423
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,070
Ki Yoo Jin...

424
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,600
Ki...

425
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,460
Yoo Jin...

426
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:18,340
Unni...

427
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,300
You draw very well.

428
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:26,900
With only the name Esther,

429
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,480
it's going to be hard to continue.

430
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,710
Look for her one more time.

431
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:40,500
One moment.

432
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,900
Yes, it's Ki Yoo Jin.

433
00:35:52,270 --> 00:35:54,210
This is an antidote.

434
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,700
- Go to the convenience store and buy all the ice they have.<br>- Ice...

435
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,900
Ice, ice.

436
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:24,700
She's shivering. What if she has a heart attack?

437
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:26,420
Raise the room temperature

438
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:29,250
so we can change her clothes. Get some warm clothing.

439
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,470
We're going to move her to the bed soon,

440
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,690
so get me a hair dryer as well.

441
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,850
What are you guys doing?

442
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,650
Is this an apartment?

443
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:50,590
Cooking in a room where you make and

444
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:52,920
share love already makes me sick.

445
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,860
But a druggie?

446
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,370
Get out now!

447
00:37:10,580 --> 00:37:12,130
Where do we go now?

448
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:13,580
Where do you live Secretary Kang?

449
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,800
I got rid of my place. We must stay out of sight.

450
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,920
Unni is going to be in danger if CEO Ki San finds us.

451
00:37:21,470 --> 00:37:22,880
Get in the car.

452
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,220
She can't stay here.

453
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,160
You should know why.

454
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,890
I thought you had to avoid Hyugnim?

455
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,900
Do you know of a better place?

456
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:31,100
Stay here temporarily.

457
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,800
Let's go to the room I stayed in.

458
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,700
So cold...

459
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,700
Unni...

460
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,910
Pour me a glass.

461
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:20,270
Why don't you explain yourself first?

462
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:23,370
You know what trauma I have.

463
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,700
How can you bring Jang Hwa Sa to my home?

464
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,560
I'm really sorry...

465
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,600
but Jang Hwa Sa's knows information that's important to me.

466
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,100
What is that?

467
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,160
Call 911.

468
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,800
I'm here!

469
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,230
Jang Hwa Sa is here! If I go around screaming this,

470
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:44,500
your brother might kill her.

471
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,020
Hyungnim wouldn't do that.

472
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:52,040
And I'm appalled that you called me here saying Hae Yi fainted from her peach allergy.

473
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:58,650
Call 911 and tell them she's in shock from a Morphine overdose.

474
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,900
Who is she?

475
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:30,100
The person I've been longing for so long...

476
00:40:38,590 --> 00:40:40,450
<i>Here's everything we investigated.</i>

477
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,310
It's my mom.

478
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:50,620
My birth mother.

479
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,650
What are you doing?

480
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:19,660
Did you drink the soju that was here?

481
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,090
You almost died a few hours ago.

482
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,100
Soju?

483
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,740
I'm going to die anyways.

484
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:28,320
What difference do a few drinks make?

485
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,260
Do you drink soju?

486
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,800
Let's pour our own drinks.

487
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,330
To your taste, as much as you'd like.

488
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:44,220
I'm unsure if cheese is good for pancreatic cancer

489
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:46,520
but isn't it better than just soju?

490
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:49,990
Who knew...

491
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,680
I'd be sitting here like this with you...

492
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,700
It's a favor for Yoo Jin. What can I do?

493
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,840
What is there between you

494
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,300
and CEO Ki San?

495
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,450
Not the cookie cutter reply that you killed Chu Young Bae,

496
00:42:11,450 --> 00:42:13,200
there's more isn't there?

497
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,800
What is it?

498
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:21,080
Why did you have to do that to Ki Chan Sung?

499
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,080
what is it?

500
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,530
I'm not going to tell you.

501
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,190
If that's the price to stay in this home...

502
00:42:28,190 --> 00:42:30,020
then I'll just have to leave.

503
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:38,540
What happened to the defibrillator?

504
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:41,000
Why do you want to know?

505
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:45,950
It's best that you don't keep your hopes up.

506
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,200
What are you doing?

507
00:42:57,390 --> 00:42:59,420
When I was in your body...

508
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,280
I was happy.

509
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:07,220
It must've been nice, you even dated.

510
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,780
You were probably happy.

511
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:14,240
You were probably miserable.

512
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,810
For the first time in my life,

513
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,110
I slept for eight hours and

514
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:24,300
stuffed myself with carbs.

515
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,100
That was the only good part.

516
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:34,140
I guess there was something good.

517
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:40,010
I have no desire

518
00:43:40,010 --> 00:43:41,610
to laugh with you,

519
00:43:42,390 --> 00:43:44,530
or sit here and drink with you.

520
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,300
Find a place to stay within the next few days.

521
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,100
I'll give you money.

522
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,870
This is a chef.

523
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,900
So. So. So. So.

524
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,500
Oh, yeah.

525
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:30,410
Gah! This is terrible.

526
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:32,250
MSG.

527
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:34,500
You have to add MSG

528
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,800
to make it tasty.

529
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,600
I love you.

530
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,220
Bong Sam,

531
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,000
don't you smell the soybean stew?

532
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,050
If you smelled it, hurry up and bring spoons and chopsticks.

533
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,340
Thick skinned punk. I'm going to eat by myself.

534
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:51,000
I figured out who the fingerprints on the USB belong to...

535
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,900
her face is so familiar.

536
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:55,000
Hyungnim, take a look.

537
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,040
- Song Han Byul.<br>- Right?

538
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,200
She's the one you arrested, right?

539
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:05,800
It's her.

540
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:08,800
I think I saw her at the haejang-guk restaurant.

541
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,600
- Are you sure?<br>- Yeah.

542
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,950
That's it then.

543
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:13,600
We just have to find her.

544
00:45:23,490 --> 00:45:26,240
- Hyung.<br>- What?

545
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,510
- Song Han Byul has a boyfriend. <br> - Yeah?

546
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:30,600
His name is Kingman and I know who he is.

547
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:33,200
- He's Son Heung Min of the gaming world. <br>- Really?

548
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,400
Then ask the cybersecurity team to find out where he's logging in from.

549
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,200
Okay.

550
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,160
A dog can't cut off his s***.

551
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,800
The Kingman couldn't cut off gaming even if he's in hiding.

552
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,800
Oh, yeah!

553
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:03,070
Oh, yeah! I found her.

554
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,820
Is it fun?

555
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:12,300
Do you want to go to the Prosecutor's office

556
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,340
or do you want to end it here and go on with your game?

557
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:19,930
Hey.

558
00:46:19,930 --> 00:46:21,720
The black box footage.

559
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,820
I won't ask who's car you touched.

560
00:46:23,820 --> 00:46:25,400
But...

561
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:28,710
just tell me who ordered you to do the mirroring.

562
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,910
The Damjang attorney.

563
00:46:32,910 --> 00:46:34,900
Who?

564
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:36,290
Eulji Hae Yi?

565
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:37,890
Really?

566
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:40,720
Hey, stop spewing nonsense.

567
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:46,120
I have something I took as a receipt.

568
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,340
She's f****** pretty, isn't she?

569
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:55,790
She is.

570
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:57,090
She's daebak pretty.

571
00:46:57,100 --> 00:47:00,000
Eulji Hae Yi is the prettiest in the whole world.

572
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,300
Hey. You're smart.

573
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:05,800
Hey, call Oppa if you need anything. Get her number.

574
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,350
Hyung.

575
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,600
Okay.

576
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,400
Yes, Prosecutor.

577
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,190
Did you find her?

578
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:26,350
She's at Attorney Eulji Hae Yi's home.

579
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,730
Jang Hwa Sa,

580
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:42,270
why do you have this picture?

581
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:49,020
I don't know how much I can trust you.

582
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,000
Unni, he saved you.

583
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,500
He's still Ki San's younger brother.

584
00:47:57,350 --> 00:47:59,490
Let me put it this way.

585
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:01,100
This person...

586
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,880
is more precious to me

587
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,670
than my brother.

588
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:08,770
Doctor Ki, your nephew...

589
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,700
The accident Ki Chan Sung faked and killed...

590
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,500
Isn't that too assertive?

591
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,230
The person Ki Chan Sung killed and faked an accident.

592
00:48:16,230 --> 00:48:17,900
She's Morgan Kim's friend.

593
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:22,330
Why do you think Morgan Kim came to Seoul?

594
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:24,550
She came to meet Esther.

595
00:48:24,550 --> 00:48:26,200
Do you know where she is?

596
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:35,000
She passed away.

597
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:38,860
Unni, what do we do?

598
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:48,820
Unni, what's wrong?

599
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:52,470
When I see Doctor Ki,

600
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:54,940
he stirs up a memory.

601
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:56,800
I don't know.

602
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,970
Whenever I think about it...

603
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:03,190
my head feels like it'll explode.

604
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,500
Sunbae.

605
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,000
Welcome, Doctor Ki.

606
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,400
- Have you been doing well?<br>- Yes.

607
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,600
Don't be so nervous. Think of it as seeing a fortune-teller.

608
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,640
What do you mean fortune-teller?

609
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:24,600
You get paid, you scratch the itch,

610
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,000
and the atmosphere makes up the most of it.

611
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:30,340
Hypnotics is even recognized by the NFS as science.

612
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,300
Why so serious?

613
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,770
You're right.

614
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:37,750
Except that fortune-tellers tell the future which can't be confirmed,

615
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,220
and we find past memories that have been buried

616
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:42,050
in the subconscious.

617
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:50,880
Now...

618
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:54,960
You are asleep in the passenger seat.

619
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,350
Open your eyes.

620
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,030
<i>What do you see?</i>

621
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:10,990
No...

622
00:50:10,990 --> 00:50:13,730
No, it can't be!

623
00:50:13,730 --> 00:50:16,900
On the count of three, you will awake.

624
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,920
One, two, three.

625
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:34,640
It was you...

626
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:39,640
The one who died...

627
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:43,050
was you.

628
00:50:44,430 --> 00:50:46,450
What do you mean

629
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:48,030
it was me?

630
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:49,790
My gosh...

631
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,220
The one who died wasn't Chu Young Bae...

632
00:50:57,390 --> 00:50:59,670
it was you!

633
00:51:00,910 --> 00:51:02,230
Unni...

634
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,900
The bail request?

635
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:14,000
The Judge isn't very fond of us.

636
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,890
What about plan B?

637
00:51:16,890 --> 00:51:18,600
Conglomerates...

638
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,070
you've seen how they're released on the news.

639
00:51:21,070 --> 00:51:24,870
Chan Sung, wouldn't it be a good idea if you're released on sick bail?

640
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:26,860
What to do...

641
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:29,430
It's a shame I don't have an illness.

642
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:38,620
Drink it if you're thirsty.

643
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,500
What are you looking at you punk?

644
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:17,300
CEO.

645
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:30,400
[ Theta wave - The state of being half asleep and awake ]<br>You were probably in a theta state.

646
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,590
A hallucination from being half awake yet asleep.

647
00:52:32,590 --> 00:52:33,880
No...

648
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:37,080
it was you, Doctor Ki.

649
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,110
Hyungnim, Jang Hwa Sa,

650
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:42,540
and Chu Young Bae...

651
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:47,540
this is all too difficult for me.

652
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:50,080
I don't know the truth hidden in that triangle.

653
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:55,780
I'll trust that you'll tell me that secret some day.

654
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:26,150
I think getting a place near Sadangdong is best.

655
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:27,690
It's close to Oppa's hospital.

656
00:53:27,690 --> 00:53:30,790
The b**** keeps telling us to leave. What can we do?

657
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:32,310
Okay.

658
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,780
We must leave...

659
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,880
You can go.

660
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,320
I cooked tilefish porridge. Make sure to eat.

661
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,700
Pal Pal, is that you?

662
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:11,100
You aren't even shocked.

663
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:13,520
Has it been 34 years?

664
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:20,590
There are so many surprising things...

665
00:54:22,170 --> 00:54:24,410
When did you find out I was alive?

666
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:36,710
Why?

667
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,810
Why did you try to kill me?

668
00:54:46,460 --> 00:54:49,820
Because I figured out that even painful love comes to an end.

669
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:54,660
I've learned there's no such thing as being able to live

670
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:56,250
without someone.

671
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:01,690
I'm not one to rely on love...

672
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:03,320
I learned that, too.

673
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:09,220
Is that a reason?

674
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:11,030
I wanted to be stronger.

675
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:13,510
- Is that a reason?<br>- That...

676
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,400
that became a reason. 34 years ago it did.

677
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,400
It's you...

678
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:24,840
The man who tried to kill me at the motel?

679
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:26,960
You never should've touched Chan Sung.

680
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,730
Chu Young Bae!

681
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:31,510
There were many who threw rocks at me, criticized me,

682
00:55:31,510 --> 00:55:33,150
and vowed to kill me...

683
00:55:33,150 --> 00:55:35,930
but no one has targeted Chan Sung.

684
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,300
You shouldn't have pointed your knife at Chan Sung

685
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:40,800
but at me! You should've pointed it at me!

686
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:51,500
I knew it was you.

687
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,010
What are you doing?

688
00:55:53,010 --> 00:55:54,840
Did I slip vital information?

689
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:58,280
Like I said before, I have no interest in you.

690
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,910
- How are you going to explain the USB?<br>- What USB?

691
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:05,190
- Ki Chan Sung's USB?<br>- Song Han Byul told me everything.

692
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:09,080
You told her to make sure to give it to me before the trial.

693
00:56:09,080 --> 00:56:11,840
- Whatever it is you heard...<br>- Looking after Jang Hwa Sa's mother,

694
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:15,150
helping with Jang Hwa Sa's retrial, and giving me the evidence.

695
00:56:15,150 --> 00:56:16,180
I knew it.

696
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:19,920
This is Eulji Hae Yi's true form. I...

697
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:25,430
Eulji Hae Yi.

698
00:56:25,430 --> 00:56:26,700
Hae Yi.

699
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,520
Why is she hiding it?

700
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,280
What is she afraid of?

701
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:33,000
Geez.

702
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,580
Did I grab her hand too suddenly?

703
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,500
Oh, goodness.

704
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:43,910
The remainder of your life...

705
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:45,970
how about you spend it

706
00:56:45,970 --> 00:56:48,260
quietly and peacefully?

707
00:56:48,260 --> 00:56:51,970
If you'd like I'll let you stay at San Hae Hospital...

708
00:56:51,970 --> 00:56:54,390
and spend your final days with me.

709
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:56,620
You knew...

710
00:56:58,150 --> 00:57:00,210
I had pancreatic cancer.

711
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:02,430
I know more about you than you think.

712
00:57:02,430 --> 00:57:03,760
Let's...

713
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:06,090
end things here.

714
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:08,160
Hating and resenting me,

715
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:11,100
stop living your final days like this.

716
00:57:13,310 --> 00:57:15,020
Stop it?

717
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:20,410
You think that's possible?

718
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,800
It isn't...

719
00:57:27,220 --> 00:57:29,060
It probably isn't possible...

720
00:57:29,060 --> 00:57:32,170
Do everything you want to me, but...

721
00:57:33,090 --> 00:57:35,110
don't touch Chan Sung.

722
00:57:35,110 --> 00:57:36,300
Hwa Sa.

723
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:38,970
Don't touch my son.

724
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:42,280
I lived as a death row inmate for 34 years.

725
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:45,950
The Jang Hwa Sa you knew is dead and gone.

726
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,730
I'm no longer the girl who said she'd die with Chu Young Bae...

727
00:57:50,730 --> 00:57:52,450
34 years...

728
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:56,270
a lot of time has passed.

729
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,780
Just as you aren't the Jang Hwa Sa you used to be,

730
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:02,290
I'm no longer the same Chu Young Bae. So...

731
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:06,020
don't touch Chan Sung.

732
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,920
You're right, Chu Young Bae!

733
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:13,580
A lot of time has passed.

734
00:58:16,270 --> 00:58:17,840
Do you know

735
00:58:17,840 --> 00:58:20,220
what I'm afraid of?

736
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:21,340
Death?

737
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,800
No.

738
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:27,920
Leaving you...

739
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:33,170
to live in this world and die as Ki San.

740
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,120
That's what I'm afraid of.

741
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:51,780
CEO.

742
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:56,310
CEO, Jang Hwa Sa is here because...

743
00:58:56,310 --> 00:58:58,650
No need to explain.

744
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,800
Eulji Hae Yi.

745
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:38,080
[ In Chicago with my loving son ]

746
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:42,750
[ In Chicago with my loving son ]

747
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:48,060
<i>The one who died who wasn't Chu Young Bae...</i>

748
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:52,300
<i>it was you!</i>

749
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:11,480
What is it?

750
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:13,250
Eulji Hae Yi.

751
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,750
Eulji Hae Yi,

752
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:17,400
you're under arrest for the murder of Ma Hyun Cheol.

753
01:01:17,400 --> 01:01:19,260
You can hire a lawyer and

754
01:01:19,260 --> 01:01:21,310
request a record of your arrest charges.

755
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:26,620
It's not me...

756
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:28,600
It wasn't me...

757
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:30,440
It wasn't me...

758
01:01:31,550 --> 01:01:33,760
Let go! It wasn't me...

759
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:36,150
It wasn't me!

760
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,400
[ Room No. 9 ]

761
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,040
<i>Do you admit to the murder of Ma Hyun Cheol?</i>

762
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:19,600
<i>Whatever it takes, bring my son back home.</i>

763
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:20,810
<i>Director, it's you, isn't it?</i>

764
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:22,890
<i>Why did he die?</i>

765
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:24,690
<i> Why? Why are you trying to kill me?</i>

766
01:02:24,690 --> 01:02:28,450
<i>So you're saying there's a chance that Ma Hyun Cheol didn't die from a fractured skull?</i>

767
01:02:28,450 --> 01:02:30,000
<i>Save me, CEO. </i>

768
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:33,060
<i> Abidjan General Hospital.</i>

769
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:35,520
<i>Is there a reason you need to get rid of me? </i>

770
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,730
<i>I've already let go of your hand.</i>

771
01:02:38,730 --> 01:02:42,380
<i>How did Chu Young Bae get the name Ki San?</i>

772
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:44,430
<i>Leave the country for a year.</i>

773
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:45,970
<i>Leave the country for a year.</i>

774
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,540
<i>Dad, if you're Chu Young Bae...</i>

775
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:49,620
<i>What about me? Who am I?</i>

776
01:02:51,300 --> 01:02:53,300
<i>What is it you want?</i>
