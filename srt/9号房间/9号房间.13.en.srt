I'm sorry.

8

9
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:59,500
Okay, then old folks and

10
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,150
- who likes old folks, let's play on.
- Okay.

"How people around see me."

51

The most important witness in Jang Hwa Sa's appeal.

The most important witness in Chan Sung's trial.

63
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,300
He jumped to his death in the Philippines.

64
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,440
- Then their suicides...
- They're not suicides.

65
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,570
They're probably not suicides.

66
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,970
Then perhaps...

67
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,800
it's Chu Young Bae?

68
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,830
The person you're fighting with...

69
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,740
is too dangerous.

70
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,990
Can't you compromise?

71
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,650
How can you tell me to compromise with my father's killer?

Damjang's seniors and juniors,

76
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,620

77
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,500
More than 160 attorneys will jump on this case.

78
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,880
You don't stand a chance.

79
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:05,040
You must feel very burdened.

80
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,270
I think getting sleep...

81
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:10,660
will be better than drinking alcohol.

83
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,750

85
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,480
Yoo Jin.

86
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,170
You must face reality.

87
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,750
You won't benefit from this.

88
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,300
What's my benefit?

89
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,870
Your safety.

90
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,910
That's a priority.

91
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,480

I know you're worried about me.

93
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,470
But there's nothing to think over.

94
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:30,740
This won't end after you stop Jang Hwa Sa's appeal.

95
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:35,150
SHC Group's parent company is San Hae Corp., isn't it?

96
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,300
If we go to trial, the media will be in a frenzy.

99
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,110
then the Court won't be...

100

101
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,380
So what?

102
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,910
Then SHC...

103

I think she should go to the ER.

This is better than painkillers.

121
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,570
The convulsion is due to her pancreas,

122
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,890
and the stomach is near the back.

123
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,070

186
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:32,650
Wow. Seeing that you remember a nobody like me,

187
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:35,580
you had something to do with it, right?

188
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,590
You were once in Jo Eun's homicide department.

189
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:41,430
You really love your hoobaes. Thank you.

190
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:44,600
Hey, Chan Sung.

191
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,640
Suh Eun Young was an unfortunate victim.

192
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,000
Why did you kill Morgan Kim and Ma Hyun Cheol?

193
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,310
What is this punk doing?

194
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,490
Hey!

195
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:00,470
Why did you let this punk in?

196
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,870
Take him outside.

197
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:03,580
I don't understand.

198
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:06,120
Morgan Kim and Ma Hyun Cheol were your father's friends.

199
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,330
So why did you kill them?

200
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:09,090
Tell me the reason! Huh?

201
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,120
Let go, you punk. Let me go!

202
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,480
What's going on?

203
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:18,980
The case halting due to the suspect's illness, there's nothing we can do about it.

204
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:22,220
But I won't bury the case without asking the reasons.

205
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,000
My nephew ended up like this because of your coercive arrest!

206
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,310
I pity Morgan Kim, Suh Eun Young, and Lee Sang Hee more.

207
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:30,720
More than your nephew!

208
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,070
What? Why you...

209
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:34,250
Get him out of here. Quietly.

210
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:38,910
CEO Ki San, you might know the answers better than Chan Sung.

211
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:41,290
That punk hasn't learned from his suspension!

212
00:13:41,290 --> 00:13:42,150
Fine!

213
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:50,320
What is the question I might know the answer to?

214
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,340
Cases are divided into three categories.

215
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,360
Money, a crime of passion, and hush money.

216
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,740
Morgan Kim and Ma Hyun Cheol are all tied to you.

217
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,350
But why did your son kill them?

218
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:03,890
Why on earth did you have to keep them quiet?

219
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,070
Take him away!

220
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:11,070
Don't let him come back.

221
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:14,510
CEO, what is it? What?

222
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,720
What's the reason?

223
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,610
Let go, punk. Let me go!

224
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:18,890
CEO!

225
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,080
I said, I'm leaving!

226
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,740
Geez.

227
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,880
These bottles will break!

228
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:28,120
There's something.

229
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,890
Something's there.

230
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,630
There's...

231
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:34,800
something for sure.

232
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,410
Huh?

233
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:47,280
Attorney...

234
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,480
What's going on?

235
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,930
Taxi!

236
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:09,400
Taxi.

237
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:27,940
Can I help you?

238
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,330
I'm Kam Mi Ran.

239
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,750
Attorney Eulji Hae Yi's secretary. We've met before.

240
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,530
I forgot my entry pass today.

241
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:37,850
But what's this?

242
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:41,070
To put in the break room's refrigerator.

243
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,800
I'll get going now.

244
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:56,700
Hey! Kam Mi Ran, are you back?

245
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,030
What's going on?

246
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:09,180
- About what?
- Attorney Eulji was fired. Why is she here?

247
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,510
For her severance pay?

248
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,220
The vibe with the Director was too nicey for that.

249
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,200
What is it?

250
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,970
I don't know what's going on.

251
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:18,020
The company politics change once a day.

252
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:22,580
I'd gotten on Attorney Eulji's bad side.

253
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:26,200
Can you set up a meeting for us to grab drinks?

254
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:32,600
My goodness. Geez.

255
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,860
What's going on, Pal Pal?

256
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,180
She returned to Damjang.

257
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:46,710
She looked friendly with Kim Jong Soo.

258
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:49,560
Aren't we fighting Chu Young Bae?

259
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,640
She meets Kim Jong Soo during a war?

260
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,980
Isn't that nonsense?

261
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:05,510
Is this the reason you called me here for?

262
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:07,380
Let's not hold any grudges.

263
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,740
When will you report back to work?

264
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:13,530
Both Jang Hwa Sa and Yoo Jin...

265
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:17,900
shouldn't know that I'm on CEO's side now, right?

266
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,420
My return to Damjang.

267
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,970
I think it's premature to discuss it.

268
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,530
Ki Yoo Jin's lawsuit docs and

269
00:17:27,530 --> 00:17:30,320
evidence. When will you give them to me?

270
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,010
There's still some time.

271
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,980
I'm just checking. Let's call it a motivation.

272
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,460
Attorney Eulji, the evidence

273
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,040
of your bribes,

274
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:48,880
corruption, and fabricated evidence are in my hands.

275
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,810
<i>What Hae Yi said is true.</i>

276
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:57,180
The Court employees aren't lazy, but

277
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,800
they review about 800 cases a month.

278
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,280
It's overwhelming to read all the documents.

279
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,510
It's because...

280
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,360
I don't have much time.

281
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,140
Aigoo, I'm broke but I must buy those punks some black bean noodles.

282
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,210
It costs money to pressure them.

283
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,360
I have to feed them something.

284
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,730
Yes, Yoo Jin.

285
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:44,230
The identity verification docs are being submitted?

286
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:46,970
- Yes.
- I'll meet you at the Court tomorrow.

287
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,650
What time will you submit the docs?

288
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,490
<i>No, Yoo Jin. I'll do it myself.</i>

289
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:54,050
I can do it by myself.

290
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,730
Since it's for my father...

291
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:00,820
I want us to do it together.

292
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,540
<i>Do you want to grab dinner?</i>

293
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,270
<i>You've worked hard.</i>

294
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,920
Doctor Ki.

295
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,060
Welcome.

296
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,960
Would you like a glass of wine?

297
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:23,830
No, I'll have it during dinner.

298
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,430
It smells amazing.

299
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:29,300
Oh! No, no, no, no, no.

300
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:32,150
That's not respectful to luxury goods.

301
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,200
Unnie's stir-fried pork with kimchi

302
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,750
tastes amazing, but the oily smell is...

303
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,100
Thank you.

304
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,750
I'll put it away.

305
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,130
I only know how to make dishes like these.

306
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,620
You ate a lot of delicious things because you're wealthy, right?

307
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:08,710
It's delicious.

308
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:11,140
You're ill, yet you still cooked.

309
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:15,440
<i>You'll be stripped of your license, so you can't work as a lawyer.</i>

310
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,130
<i>And with all this, you'll get prison time.</i>

311
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,590
<i>Three years? Maybe four years?</i>

312
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,900
<i>Well, it's your choice.</i>

313
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:29,130
<i>You'll be dragged down even worse than your father, Eulji Sung.</i>

314
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:32,180
Hae Yi.

315
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,610
Hae Yi!

316
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,930
Attorney!

317
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,810
What are you thinking about?

318
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:44,250
What time are you going to Court tomorrow?

319
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,060
In the morning.

320
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,520
My stomach's not feeling well.

321
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:07,100
<i>You don't regret living like this?</i>

322
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:11,110
<i>You were a genius prosecutor, and an aspiring inspector general.</i>

323
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:13,760
<i>Are you okay with living like this?</i>

324
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,370
<i>No, I wasn't okay.</i>

325
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:23,160
<i>I wasn't okay when your mom left me,</i>

326
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:26,530
<i>and I wasn't okay every time I saw you.</i>

327
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,870
Huh? Unnie.

328
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:40,210
Yes.

329
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:41,980
One moment.

330
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,360
Yes, it's Jang Hwa Sa.

331
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,570
<i>Your documents haven't been submitted yet.</i>

332
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:51,020
<i>I need to ask Hae Yi where she submitted them.</i>

333
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,560
Hae Yi.

334
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,240
What are you doing?

335
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,400
Weren't you going to the bathroom?

336
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,540
Why are you holding that?

337
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,290
Take Professor Kang's call.

338
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,230
What is he talking about?

339
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,070
Hae Yi.

340
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:39,850
What are you doing?

341
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,030
Weren't you going to the bathroom?

342
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,190
Why are you holding that?

343
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:49,940
Take Professor Kang's call.

344
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,850
What is he talking about?

345
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,460
Who did you give the documents to?

346
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,760
Hae Yi.

347
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,650
<i>Professor Kang said to go thank Judge Yang in person.</i>

348
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,120
<i>Where did you take the documents?</i>

349
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,930
I'll call you later.

350
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:11,690
Hae Yi.

351
00:23:21,210 --> 00:23:22,520
Hae Yi.

352
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,150
Hae Yi.

353
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,340
My appeal documents

354
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:33,980
and evidence. Where did they go?

355
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:36,590
Did you submit them to the court?

356
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,580
She's asking you what happened.

357
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:42,770
And what did I see earlier?

358
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,340
You gave it to Kim Jong Soo.

359
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:47,470
You gave them to Chu Young Bae through Kim Jong Soo, right?

360
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,460
Is that right?

361
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,020
Are Kam Mi Ran's words true?

362
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,480
Tell me.

363
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,990
You don't have a chance. Why don't you know that?

364
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,750
Hae Yi.

365
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,350
It's not true, is it?

366
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:28,350
Jang Hwa Sa's appeal documents.

367
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,010
It's not true, right?

368
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,160
Answer me.

369
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,220
It's true.

370
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,910
This is for the best.

371
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:42,770
For both you and me.

372
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,740
For the best?

373
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,520
This is for the best?

374
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:52,040
Even if we win the trial,

375
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:54,300
CEO Ki San, no...

376
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,570
Do you think Chu Young Bae will leave us alone?

377
00:24:56,570 --> 00:24:59,390
- Before we even go to trial...
- So?

378
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:02,500
You want me to accept San Hae Hospital from Chu Young Bae

379
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,480
and partner up with my father's killer?

380
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:08,320
Is this what you want to say?

381
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,700
Is this the advice you wanted to give me?

382
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,510
Everyone's like you at first.

383
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:18,690
Whether it's a malpractice or a vehicle accident.

384
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,050
People who lost their families...

385
00:25:21,050 --> 00:25:23,750
all want to reveal the truth.

386
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,620
But...

387
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:28,530
things change with time.

388
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,760
The appeal means the world to Unnie.

389
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,850
You b****.

390
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,340
I'll kill you.

391
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:21,950
Because life goes on.

392
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,730
Those left behind must find a way to survive.

393
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:27,750
He killed my father.

394
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:29,920
He stole my father's life!

395
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,750
He also ruined my father, too.

396
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,830
Yoo Jin...

397
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,830
I don't want to end up like my father.

398
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,130
I can't be dragged down like this!

399
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,030
Stop it!

400
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,650
If you don't want that...

401
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,900
please remember how dangerous of a person...

402
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,180
Chu Young Bae is.

403
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,980
Let me ask you something.

404
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,730
All this is...

405
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,510
because you're worried about me?

406
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,240
Was it for me?

407
00:27:16,030 --> 00:27:17,300
No.

408
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,130
It was for me.

409
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:32,250
The benefits you spoke of...

410
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,590
I guess it was this.

411
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:38,550
Perhaps you...

412
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,120
you loved me because...

413
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,180
I was CEO Ki San's brother, and not Ki Yoo Jin.

414
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:55,790
Yoo Jin!

415
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,840
Beware of CEO Ki San.

416
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:55,690
<i>Hey, high school kid.</i>

417
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:59,100
<i>I don't like high school kids now, and not ever.</i>

418
00:29:03,310 --> 00:29:05,460

419
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:07,200

<i>I'll give you my all, Noona.</i>

422
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,810
<i>What? It's my birthday today.</i>

423
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,300
<i>I'm a bit late, Hae Yi.</i>

424
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:34,420

<i>We all dream of "always,"</i>

429
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,210
<i>but only shards of memory...</i>

430
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:57,990

432
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,620
<i>there is no "always."</i>

433

Do you want to eat later?

440

Okay.

441
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:54,900
Chan Sung, do you know Christopher Reeve who played Superman?

442
00:31:57,150 --> 00:32:00,220
He fell while horseback riding and

443
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,370
became very ill.

444
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,850
He released a biography and became a writer.

445
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:08,630
He returned to society as a movie director, too.

446
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,910
Doesn't that make him a real-life Superman?

447
00:32:12,650 --> 00:32:15,770
Son, should you change your major, too?

448
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:18,870
Biotechnology is good.

449
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:21,540
Since you're smart,

450
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,180
like Stephen Hawking...

451
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,230
Dad.

452
00:32:24,230 --> 00:32:25,640
Yes?

453
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,100
Do you love me?

454
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:32,870
Of course, I love you. Of course.

455
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:33,740
Then...

456
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,830
please let me die.

457
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:43,070
Please.

458
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,140
Dad, please kill me.

459
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:53,050
It's not...

460
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:55,490
good to say such things, son.

461
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:57,740
Dad will make sure to...

462
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,240
make you stand again.

463
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,690
Even if I have to exchange it with SHC,

464
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,050
I'll make my son stand again.

465
00:33:05,050 --> 00:33:06,940
I will...

466
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:09,270
I'll make it happen.

467
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,740
Don't drink it.

468
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:51,090
Unnie!

469
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:52,320
Go inside.

470
00:34:08,470 --> 00:34:11,370
My mother who's soon to be 90...

471
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,770
is hanging onto her life...

472
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:19,010
because of hope.

473
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,040
To see her daughter acquitted, and...

474
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,230
the reason...

475
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,610
I'm hanging onto life is...

476
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,160
because of Chu Young Bae.

477
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,140
Bring it back, Hae Yi.

478
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:53,440
My mom exchanged...

479
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:56,020
her life...

480
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,740
for that 911 tape.

481
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,350
I don't think I will...

482
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,200
make it to this winter.

483
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:19,300
I'm begging you.

484
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,310
Let me have my...

485
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,210
appeals trial...

486
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,150
before it's too late.

487
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,040
It's too late now.

488
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,070
Why did you do that?

489
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:51,960
Why?

490
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,640
I didn't want to...

491
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,260
live like my dad.

492
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:28,780
<i>[ Seoul Jo Eun Police Department ]</i>

493
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,320
Hey.

494
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,140
What are you doing here?

495
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,010
Oh, yes.

496
00:36:38,010 --> 00:36:39,340
I've...

497
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,160
come to request an investigation.

498
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,970
Well, Detective Oh can't take on any cases.

499
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:48,800
He's off duty for three months, so tell me...

500
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,710
I have bento containers to return to Hae Yi.

501
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:54,350
Let's go. You give it to her on my behalf.

502
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,640
I'll just give her the containers.

503
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,190
Come this way.

504
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,380
I had wanted to meet with you.

505
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,830
What is your request?

506
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:09,220
Why did you want to see me, Detective?

507
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:11,910
Since you were San Hae Group's

508
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,850
CEO Ki Se Woong's secretary,

509
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:16,010
you know info about Ki San, right?

510
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:20,630
Morgan Kim was CEO Ki San's classmate,

511
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:22,970
and Ma Hyun Cheol was his right hand man.

512
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:27,470
But I'm curious as to why Ki Chan Sung had to kill them.

513
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:30,220
Isn't murder for one of these three reasons?

514
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,690
Money, jealousy, and to hide something.

515
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,190
- Shutting someone's mouth.
- Secret.

516
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:38,060
Someone has to hide it...

517
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,940
and someone wants to reveal it.

518
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,380
How did you know that?

519
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,660
That's a trade secret.

520
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,780
Wow.

521
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,890
Did it leak out?

522
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,170
Jang Hwa Sa, what did you do with it?

523
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,120
Have a drink.

524
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,910
All fields need people with experience.

525
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,590
Noona, you're the best.

526
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:19,210
People's outside ages, but not their hearts.

527
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:21,900
Everyone has a child inside their hearts.

528
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,830
It's nice to hear, "Noona."

529
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,590
Well, then...

530
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:32,260
the secret which Morgan Kim and Ma Hyun Cheol tried to reveal,

531
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:35,610
and Ki Chan Sung tried to hide. Would you know what it is?

532
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,490
I do.

533
00:38:38,490 --> 00:38:39,590
What is it?

534
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,720
First,

535
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,450
there are things I need to take care of.

536
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:50,290
Who the person who killed NFS investigator Lee Sang Hee is...

537
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,470
Noona, how do you know Lee Sang Hee?

538
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:54,580
Who the person who Kang Han Su is...

539
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:55,710
and

540
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,220
who the man who tried to kill me is.

541
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,020
Who's behind it all.

542
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,780
What are you talking about?

543
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:04,340
Explain it to me.

544
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,130
<i>When I was</i>

545
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,740
<i>It's true that I had morphine</i>

546
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,060
<i>because of my pain. I'm positive</i>

547
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,700
<i>the man was trying to kill me.</i>

548
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,220
When was that?

549
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:38,140
Where?

550
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:42,180
September 13th at Dong Do Motel in Seodaemun.

551
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:45,180
NFS Lee Sang Hee, Kang Han Sun, and Jang Hwa Sa.

552
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:47,930
You're saying they're all related to the murders?

553
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,410
As you may know,

554
00:39:51,410 --> 00:39:52,990
I'm...

555
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:56,810
out on a stay of execution.

556
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,990
That means I don't have very long to live.

557
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,320
Detective, you're the only person

558
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,720
who can help me.

559
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:16,190
Okay.

560
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,720
<i>It's Jang Hwa Sa.</i>

561
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,900
<i>The person who killed Director Ma</i>

562
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,830
<i>is Jang Hwa Sa?</i>

563
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,360
<i>Who are you now?</i>

564
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,240
<i>Jang Hwa Sa?</i>

565
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:51,600
<i>I'm Eulji Hae Yi.</i>

566
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:55,280
Do you...

567
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:59,920
you don't believe in mysterious things

568
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,040
that happen outside of human control, right?

569
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,820
Yes, CEO.

570
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,780
Chan Sung...

571
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:11,660
asked me to kill him.

572
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:17,700
In front of a father, a child...

573
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,350
asked me to kill him.

574
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,180
I want to believe it.

575
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,490
I must believe it.

576
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:30,210
They say my son can stand again,

577
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,390
why can't I believe it?

578
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:41,270
Hyungnim!

579
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:43,270
- What?
- The blanket.

580
00:41:43,270 --> 00:41:45,200
Move the blanket.

581
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,080
Geez.

582
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,490
Good job.

583
00:41:55,490 --> 00:41:59,660
The first female you bring is Jang Hwa Sa?

584
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:01,530
She refused to go home.

585
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,640
Was I supposed to leave her at a motel?

586
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:06,790
She's ill. What if something went wrong?

587
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,550
Aigoo.

588
00:42:08,550 --> 00:42:11,660
Aigoo.

589
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:15,790
What are you doing?

590
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:18,170
It's so odd.

591
00:42:18,170 --> 00:42:20,280
They're not related by blood,

592
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,840
nor do they look alike.

593
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,840
But why does Noona feel like Eulji Hae Yi?

594
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,360
You crazy bastard!

595
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:29,270
That's why you need to date.

596
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:32,040
Stop chasing after Eulji Hae Yi and start dating.

597
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:33,460
- Okay?
- Be quiet.

598
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,580
Start dating.

599
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,870
- Okay?
- Hyungnim, you need to date.

600
00:42:35,870 --> 00:42:37,730
Date. You're condition is serious.

601
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:04,370
I couldn't bring the hard photo evidence for the case.

602
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,180
It was...

603
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:07,750
too much for me.

604
00:43:07,750 --> 00:43:10,840
No, no. That's not why I called you over.

605
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:14,270
What can you do if it's too much for you?

606
00:43:14,270 --> 00:43:18,530
We can all put our heads together and figure it out.

607
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:22,990
Then, why?

608
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:24,560
- Director Park.
- Yes.

609
00:43:26,630 --> 00:43:29,940
<i>Your beauty has degraded.</i>

610
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,490
<i>Enough of your nonsense.</i>

611
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:35,190
<i>You're here because you believe I'm Eulji Hae Yi.</i>

612
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,610
Pause it.

613
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:43,290
Is that Jang Hwa Sa

614
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,870
really you?

615
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,300
Yes.

616
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,140
See. There are such things as miracles in life.

617
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,720
How was

618
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:06,950
something like that possible?

619
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,060
<i>It was a faulty vehicle...</i>

620
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,280
<i>Are you crazy right now?</i>

621
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:16,190
<i>not being able to inspect it before hand...</i>

622
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,960
<i>Chu Young Bae...</i>

623
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,030
<i>[ Caution 110 voltage ]</i>

624
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:24,350
<i>Let's do this. One, two, three.</i>

625
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,600
<i>So where is the defibrillator now?</i>

626
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,310
<i>Yoo Jin has it, but</i>

627
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:50,880
it's no use.

628
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:55,900
<i>I think you're asking about it because of Chan Sung</i>

629
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,260
but it already broke.

630
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,880
Come here.

631
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,570
Hurry and come.

632
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:49,020
Noona.

633
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:50,710
Noona, are you awake?

634
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:52,880
I told you she left.

635
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,500
Look.

636
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:56,980
She paid for her room charge and left.

637
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:59,780
Why did you take me jogging and s***.

638
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,360
<i>I felt like dying.</i>

639
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:04,090
What?

640
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:06,590
Oh, yeah! Let's eat.

641
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,670
It's a feast.

642
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,540
Wow, she's a chef.

643
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,890
Hyungnim, help me.

644
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:28,090
- Kang Han Su?
- Yeah.

645
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:31,540
It was ruled a suicide 20 years ago.

646
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:33,160
Where are we going to find the documents?

647
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:34,550
Then what about Sang Hee hyung?

648
00:46:34,550 --> 00:46:35,850
What?

649
00:46:35,850 --> 00:46:37,530
Are you telling me to go to the Philippines?

650
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:39,120
You can speak English.

651
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,370
Oh, my God.

652
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:46,000
You go to the Philippines.

653
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,030
Geez.

654
00:46:47,030 --> 00:46:48,690
You said you're suspended for three months.

655
00:46:48,690 --> 00:46:50,410
You have a lot of time.

656
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:51,800
Help me!

657
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,420
I'm dying of curiosity!

658
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:56,500
What secret about his dad Chan Sung was trying to hide.

659
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:57,700
Aren't you curious?

660
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:59,390
I am a little curious.

661
00:46:59,390 --> 00:47:01,190
- See, you're curious.
- A little.

662
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:03,160
- You're a little curious.
- Only this much.

663
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,830
- You're curious.
- Only this much.

664
00:47:04,830 --> 00:47:06,210
Just eat, you fat a**.

665
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:07,310
What, you a******?

666
00:47:07,310 --> 00:47:08,490
I'm sorry.

667
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,410
My life calling

668
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:16,010
must be to pack bags.

669
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,580
Unnie!

670
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:29,050
Do you know how worried I was? How can you not come home?

671
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:30,350
Are you packing your bags?

672
00:47:31,590 --> 00:47:35,450
We have a lot of stuff now, so we can't move everything at once.

673
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,890
We can't live with Eulji Hae Yi.

674
00:47:37,890 --> 00:47:40,650
Did you tell Detective Oh Bong Sam about Chu Young Bae?

675
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:44,300
No.

676
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:48,350
Why not? You went to tell him about that not stay out all night.

677
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:50,770
It happened 34 years ago.

678
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:54,210
The statute of limitation passed.

679
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,580
There's nothing an active detective can do.

680
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:00,060
Something Detective Oh

681
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,710
can do. That's what I need to request he handle.

682
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:09,210
Geez.

683
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:03,510
If my Chan Sung can stand again,

684
00:49:03,510 --> 00:49:05,830
I'll call you my savior.

685
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,650
You just have to return my file.

686
00:49:09,650 --> 00:49:11,950
There would be nothing I can't give you.

687
00:49:13,090 --> 00:49:14,890
I'll give you Damjang.

688
00:49:14,890 --> 00:49:17,860
How much longer can Hyungnim work in the field?

689
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:24,620
Is this all?

690
00:49:24,620 --> 00:49:28,610
All that was needed to switch you and Jang Hwa Sa?

691
00:49:30,870 --> 00:49:32,120
<i>You...</i>

692
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,290
<i>Jang Hwa Sa...</i>

693
00:49:33,290 --> 00:49:34,240
<i>defibrillator...</i>

694
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:36,440
<i>and me.</i>

695
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:40,600
<i>I might be what you need.</i>

696
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,240
Is there anything else that's needed?

697
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:46,860
No.

698
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,470
This is it.

699
00:49:54,610 --> 00:49:56,950
Long time no see my brother.

700
00:49:57,990 --> 00:49:59,960
Why is this here?

701
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:02,780
Stay seated.

702
00:50:02,780 --> 00:50:05,260
What are you planning to do?

703
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:12,050
I have a son who'll never be able to stand.

704
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:14,870
That son is asking me to kill him,

705
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,260
what is there that I can do?

706
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:22,360
Yoo Jin.

707
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,540
You and me,

708
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:28,040
let's put everything on hold for a moment.

709
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,580
Even during a war, there's an armistice.

710
00:50:32,430 --> 00:50:34,390
Yoo Jin,

711
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:39,190
can you help poor Chan Sung?

712
00:50:43,560 --> 00:50:45,920
I'm not sure what Hae Yi told you,

713
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,450
but this is a dangerous object.

714
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:49,040
Hae Yi.

715
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:52,060
Hae Yi!

716
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,690
Did you forget how dangerous that thing is?

717
00:51:57,690 --> 00:51:58,620
Chan Sung...

718
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:01,670
you care for him like a younger brother.

719
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:04,310
What about the other person that'll be sacrificed for Chan Sung?

720
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:06,700
Should I keep quiet about that sacrifice?

721
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:08,640
There are people that have been diagnosed as brain dead.

722
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:10,550
Do you think that monster will be satisfied with them?

723
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:13,680
It's a body Chan Sung will live in. A brain-dead person?

724
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,600
Do you think he'll be satisfied and grateful for that?

725
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,980
Hae Yi.

726
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:24,190
Hae Yi.

727
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:28,040
How bad of a villain are you trying to become?

728
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,190
How bad of person are you planning to be?

729
00:52:59,170 --> 00:53:03,870
<i>Yoo Jin, can you help poor Chan Sung?</i>

730
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,770
Chan Sung.

731
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,150
I can't do that.

732
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,280
The way you are now...

733
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:23,570
can you accept that it's punishment for your deeds

734
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:27,970
and just accept this life?

735
00:53:44,110 --> 00:53:45,710
I don't think I can.

736
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:49,660
Oh, you were awake.

737
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:01,170
Ever since I was Young,

738
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,040
I was so weak.

739
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,740
So I envied you,

740
00:54:07,740 --> 00:54:09,970
and I admired you.

741
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,200
Your height...

742
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:16,500
your strong body...

743
00:54:16,500 --> 00:54:19,000
your handsome face...

744
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:22,910
and your character.

745
00:54:26,510 --> 00:54:28,650
Every day is painful.

746
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:31,020
If I move even a little bit,

747
00:54:31,020 --> 00:54:34,660
my whole body feels like it's being ripped apart.

748
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:36,380
You want me to live like this?

749
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,190
I'd rather die right now.

750

<i>[ CCTV filming in progress ]</i>

755
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:34,680
- There's a CCTV here, too.
- Oh, there is.

756
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,930
Aigoo. You're working hard emo.

757
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:39,430
Yes, hello.

758
00:55:41,250 --> 00:55:42,290
Uh...

759
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:47,250
we don't violate the fire act or run a prostitution ring.

760
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,760
Geez. She's scared.

761
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:49,970
It's not about that.

762
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:53,510
Can I review CCTV footage from September 13th?

763
00:55:53,510 --> 00:55:56,250
Sure, come inside.

764
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:57,500
Okay, thank you.

765
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:05,020
Is it me or Yoo Jin?

766
00:56:06,050 --> 00:56:07,140
What?

767
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:11,810
CEO, why are you asking such a question?

768
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:14,910
I know everything you discussed at the Chinese restaurant,

769
00:56:14,910 --> 00:56:18,660
so there's no need to explain.

770
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,440
Is it me or Yoo Jin?

771
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:26,350
It's probably San Hae Hospital anyways.

772
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:28,930
I can give you San Hae Hospital

773
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:31,880
and your deal with Yoo Jin is probably regarding San Hae Hospital.

774
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:35,120
But Director Bong,

775
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,910
it's going to take a long time for you to get San Hae Hospital from Yoo Jin.

776
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:42,150
What are you talking about?

777
00:56:42,150 --> 00:56:44,240
When the lawsuit trial begins,

778
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:47,500
I'm going to slowly, very slowly...

779
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:51,170
rip apart the San Hae and San Hae Hospital

780
00:56:51,170 --> 00:56:54,910
employees that Yoo Jin has. I won't leave any employee

781
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:57,600
and get rid of them all.

782
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:06,470
All people

783
00:57:06,470 --> 00:57:08,450

784
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:12,800
If you grab hold of my hand now,

785
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:17,440
San Hae Hospital is yours.

786
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:22,660
If necessary, I'll get my attorney's

787
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:24,150
to write you a notarial letter.

788
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:28,810
CEO,

789
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:30,860
what can I do for you?

790
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:35,330
Save...

791
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,050
my son.

792
00:57:42,570 --> 00:57:43,620
Yes.

793
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,000
Hmm...

794
00:57:56,900 --> 00:58:00,380
The nurse said Doctor Ki didn't come in for work today.

795
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:07,110
He's not one to forget an appointment.

796
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:12,650
I have something to say to the CEO.

797
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:14,240
He's not at the hospital.

798
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,810
Go back.

799
00:58:15,810 --> 00:58:18,770
His secretary stated he went to the hospital...

800
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,970
- Director why are you...
- Attorney Eulji.

801
00:58:43,970 --> 00:58:47,940
Don't ever act like we know each other.

802
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,380
Because of you...

803
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,510
because of you...

804
00:58:51,510 --> 00:58:54,100
I almost died in the hands of the CEO.

805
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,040
My goodness.

806
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:25,350
You got your car back?

807
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,650
It looks like you got everything you could

808
00:59:28,650 --> 00:59:30,800
in exchange for ratting out my Unnie and your boyfriend.

809
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,890

810
00:59:33,110 --> 00:59:35,280
We'll go pick our stuff soon.

811
00:59:35,280 --> 00:59:37,240
You don't look so well.

812
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,870
Is that what you wish?

813
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,150
Unnie, let's go.

814
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:43,560
What happened to Doctor Ki. He's not even answering his phone.

815
00:59:43,560 --> 00:59:46,080
You're out of your medication. What do we do?

816
00:59:47,070 --> 00:59:50,270
What's up with Yoo Jin?

817
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:53,550

819
01:00:05,490 --> 01:00:06,950

821
01:00:08,030 --> 01:00:10,650
Did you lose your mind because you were dumped?

822
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:12,860
He's trying to switch with Yoo Jin.

824
01:00:14,570 --> 01:00:16,770
