It's the rules. You don't have to be sorry.

00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,490

111
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,170

Unni may look fine now, but she's really sick.

126

178
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,760
Nothing is free in this world.

179
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,700
You want me to joing hands with Bong Sa Dal who made me a death row inmate?

180
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,520
I can't do that.

181

Who's your target?

183
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:35,940
Realistically we need Director Bong's help.

184
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,420

00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:01,400
<i>CEO!</i>

546
00:46:04,460 --> 00:46:05,750
CEO, what are you doing here?

547
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:08,030
I wanted to have lunch together.

548
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:10,660
Sit down. Have a seat.

549
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:17,560
You've done a lot...

550
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:19,810
to have a 100% victor rate.

551
00:46:23,730 --> 00:46:25,180
<i>Lee Sang Hee.</i>

552
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,260
- How do you have this?<br>- You must've forgotten.

553
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,150
You gave this to me in Hyeseungpo.

554
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:39,430
That you conducted all bribes yourself.

555
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:42,260
It looks like Ma Hyun Cheol didn't trust you.

556
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:44,000
He had a lot of information

557
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,700
about you in his safe.

558
00:46:49,460 --> 00:46:53,320
You'll be stripped of your license so you can't work as a lawyer.

559
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,100
For all of this...

560
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,910
you'll get criminal punishment. About three years?

561
00:46:57,910 --> 00:46:59,500
Four years?

562
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:03,520
If I get involved, it can get longer.

563
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:10,080
It may be because I used to be a prosecutor, but

564
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:13,980
I had this thought cross my mind. Lee Sang Hee's death...

565
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:18,050
- did you order that, too?<br>- That's nonsense.

566
00:47:18,050 --> 00:47:20,550
The police will be the judge of that.

567
00:47:22,550 --> 00:47:24,750
Are you threatening me?

568
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,300
It's not a threat,

569
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:29,500
it's a proposal.

570
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,600
What do you want?

571
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:42,000
Just like you had Jang Hwa Sa's terms reduction terminated in Cheonwon.

572
00:47:43,450 --> 00:47:45,820
Show Jang Hwa Sa,

573
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:48,210
your skills.

574
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,590
I can't do that.

575
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:56,740
Your reply isn't what I expected.

576
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,400
It's your choice.

577
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:06,250
You'll be dragged down,

578
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,500
far more miserably than your father Eulji Sung.

579
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:50,000
Oh, you're right on time.

580
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,000
Hey.

581
00:48:52,070 --> 00:48:55,160
Why are you just standing there? We've been waiting for you.

582
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,190
Jang Hwa Sa wanted to wait until you were here.

583
00:49:06,910 --> 00:49:08,720
I'm hungry.

584
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,470
Let's eat.

585
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:17,570
Give me some more.

586
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:22,900
The appeals trial...

587
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,260
how long will it take?

588
00:49:27,580 --> 00:49:29,130
Since she's sick,

589
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:31,460
once we file the papers

590
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:33,450
we should ask the association for a good judgment.

591
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:37,100
Hae Yi, you're really something.

592
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,900
I thought only Eulji Sung was a genius,

593
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:41,970
but you went above an beyond to prepare for this difficult identity verification lawsuit.

594
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:44,190
Is this lawsuit,

595
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,600
really that difficult?

596
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,400
Yes.

597
00:49:48,450 --> 00:49:51,080
It's a very arduous lawsuit.

598
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:54,900
It's like the fabricated spy cases

599
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:56,900
that happened in the 70's and 80's.

600
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:01,100
Normally, the opposing team is a state authority

601
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:04,620
or people with power, so it wasn't easy.

602
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,000
Are you okay?

603
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,800
Oh, Hae Yi.

604
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,250
I'm okay.

605
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:42,590
This is how I pay for my food here.

606
00:50:42,590 --> 00:50:46,000
You don't regret living like this?

607
00:50:47,230 --> 00:50:50,920
You were a genius prosecutor, looking to become an inspector general.

608
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,120
Dad, your grades at the Judicial Training Institute

609
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,400
is still a legend.

610
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:57,900
Are you okay with living like this?

611
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:01,190
Are you really...

612
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:03,550
okay with it?

613
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:06,750
Tell me the truth.

614
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,360
I wasn't okay.

615
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,800
I wasn't okay when your mom left me,

616
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:23,800
and I wasn't okay every time I saw you.

617
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:33,350
Genius prosecutor Eulji Sung...

618
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:38,820
times when I thought the world existed for me...

619
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:41,650
when that light vanished...

620
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:47,030
it was painful to live as a failure.

621
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:51,850
I had regrets

622
00:51:51,850 --> 00:51:53,860
and it hurt.

623
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:02,700
Why did I run into Jang Hwa Sa?

624
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:05,790
When

625
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:10,890
the head prosecutor gave me that case

626
00:52:10,890 --> 00:52:12,850
I should've turned it down.

627
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:16,990
Everyday...

628
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:21,690
that thought didn't leave my mind.

629
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,990
If you go back in time,

630
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:28,160
will you turn away Jang Hwa Sa?

631
00:52:29,130 --> 00:52:30,740
Will you not

632
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,500
make the same choice?

633
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,000
I don't know.

634
00:52:38,630 --> 00:52:41,410
The "ifs" in life,

635
00:52:41,410 --> 00:52:44,260
is a fairytale elusion.

636
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:47,540
What choice I'd make...

637
00:52:47,540 --> 00:52:49,680
I don't know either.

638
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,830
However,

639
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,550
my choice to stand behind Jang Hwa Sa,

640
00:52:58,830 --> 00:53:00,420
was the right choice to make

641
00:53:01,560 --> 00:53:04,400
as a person, as someone who works in the legal world.

642
00:53:07,410 --> 00:53:10,090
That's how I've made it this far.

643
00:53:33,030 --> 00:53:36,070
Eulji Hae Yi hasn't given me an answer yet.

644
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:38,830
It isn't an easy decision.

645
00:53:38,830 --> 00:53:40,890
To make thing worse,

646
00:53:40,890 --> 00:53:43,230
she would have to break up with Yoo Jin.

647
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:47,480
Professor Kang is already requesting his hoobae Judge's to approve the appeal.

648
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:50,480
Once the papers are submitted,

649
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,100
I think Jang Hwa Sa's appeal will be accepted.

650
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,090
Hyungnim, I'll leave this up to you.

651
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:56,680
Right now...

652
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:59,070
I have a lot to deal with Chan Sung.

653
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:02,230
Okay. I'll watch them

654
00:54:02,230 --> 00:54:04,220
and once they submit the papers I'll report them for bribery.

655
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:15,720
It's Oh Bong Sam.

What is this?

658
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:33,120
I think the appeals is regarding Jang Hwa Sa.

- Identity verification?<br>- What are you looking at?

660
00:54:36,990 --> 00:54:38,850
Wow. So humiliating.

661
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:42,580
I came to tell you about the 119 rescue member Kang Han Su you asked me to find.

662
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:44,030
Did you find him?

663
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,060
Should I say I found him?

664
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,650
He committed suicide.

665
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:58,080
What?

666
00:54:58,080 --> 00:55:00,750
- Suicide?<br>- Yes.

667
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:03,290

668
00:55:03,290 --> 00:55:05,320

00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,260
At Chilseong reservoir in Iljoong.

670
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:11,000
He ate breakfast and jumped to his death on his way to work.

671
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:32,200
Chu...Young Bae...

672
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,300

That's just a guess with no evidence.

676
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:52,150
What Unni's saying is right.

677
00:55:52,150 --> 00:55:54,900
In our cell, there was a lady named 4089 unni.

678
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:58,120
She committed real estate fraud with her husband.

679

The mayor, congressmen,

680
00:56:00,550 --> 00:56:03,890
and many others were involved.

681
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:06,470
One day that unni was at her home in Bundang

682
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:09,890
and said she was going to their office with her husband, then just disappeared.

683
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:12,080
Do you know where they found them?

684
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:25,360
They found them all swollen at a reservoir in Gyeonggido.

685
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:27,720
The cause of death was a double suicide.

686
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,310
There was no will or reason to die.

<i>SHC can fall into Ki Yoo Jin's hands.</i>

725
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,900
<i>When are you going to give me Ki Yoo Jin's lawsuit papers and evidence?</i>

01:01:54,540 --> 01:01:57,430
for the sake of poor Chan Sung?
