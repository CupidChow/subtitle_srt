1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,760
who would deliberately play with children

2
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:15,600
Peace of Lo

3
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,180
Cheating

4
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,620
What did they actually do?

5
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,660
The Marquis

6
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,040
is now being mail

7
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,120
Were they taken

8
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,000
You're so arrogant.

9
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,400
You dare to call me Xiao

10
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,000
and call me Yi Cheng?

11
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,000
You even called me a coward.

12
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,400
You're so embarrassing.

13
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,800
I made a mistake

14
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,200
in this battle.

15
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,040
But why do you have to blame me?

16
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,840
The battle has been going on for a long time.

17
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,280
Although we're in the same boat,

18
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,080
the Chu army has lost a lot of soldiers.

19
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,080
Junshan died half a month ago.

20
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,480
I'm afraid he can't hide the news.

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,080
Our army's morale is already high.

22
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,800
If Feng Shiye takes the opportunity to attack the city,

23
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,080
Qingchuan Town will be in danger.

24
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,400
If Qingchuan Town is broken,

25
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,680
how can we take the responsibility

26
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,920
of suppressing thousands of people?

27
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,400
But we lost a battle.

28
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,720
Why are you so arrogant?

29
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:11,600
Just fight back.

30
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,880
I'm afraid that

31
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,560
we'll lose the battle

32
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,560
and break the army.

33
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,680
The key is

34
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,320
I want to hear

35
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,000
Qingchuan's opinion.

36
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,920
Yes?

37
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,880
Although our army lost.

38
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,040
But the Chu army can make it to the battle.

39
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,360
I've made my judgment.

40
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,800
First,

41
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,400
the Chu army has crossed the He Lian Mountain

42
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,200
and is connected to the horse net.

43
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,400
But Feng Shiyan won't attack.

44
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,800
Helian Mountain is in danger.

45
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,440
The fight between Chu and Xia

46
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,920
has been the new trouble for the Chu army.

47
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,280
You mean,

48
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,280
the food is out of stock?

49
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,320
No.

50
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,320
Feng Shiyan

51
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,840
won't make the same mistake.

52
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,200
This time,

53
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,280
he will protect the food with all his troops.

54
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,320
At this moment,

55
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,920
all the scholars will attack from the front

56
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,000
to attract their attention.

57
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,120
I will lead the elite troops

58
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,320
to attack the main camp from Helian Mountain.

59
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,480
When they return to the room,

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,400
the scholars will lead the troops to attack

61
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,520
and defeat the Chu army.

62
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:37,160
It's a good idea to attack the enemy.

63
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,240
But if we succeed,

64
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,680
we can force Feng Shiyan to retreat.

65
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,280
After all, the main camp

66
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,520
is the old place of Feng Shiyan,

67
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,560
Chu.

68
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,040
Exactly.

69
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,120
What's the matter?

70
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,720
Qingchuan,

71
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,080
do you know

72
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,480
if the Chu army finds out about the march,

73
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,640
you will face the Chu army of 100,000 soldiers.

74
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,400
You...

75
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,480
I can't come back.

76
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,960
Uncle Huai Zhang,

77
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,120
I understand.

78
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,040
I will take the title of

79
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,480
the late king of the Mo's Army

80
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,320
and inherit the title of the late king.

81
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,200
I will be content.

82
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,040
Why should I fear death?

83
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,920
I agree with the strategy of the late general.

84
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,800
I agree.

85
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,960
I agree.

86
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,480
I agree.

87
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,440
I wonder what your opinion

88
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,040
on this strategy.

89
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:56,680
Being there

90
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,640
is good.

91
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,120
Since you are determined,

92
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:08,320
I can take the responsibility.

93
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,400
I am

94
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,480
strict with you.

95
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,280
I wish you good health and a long life.

96
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,600
I'm so relieved to have Yan'er here.

97
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,520
Why isn't Junyu here?

98
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,760
Mr. Mo is here.

99
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,600
He caught a cold recently.

100
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,360
He really needs to rest.

101
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,920
Please forgive him.

102
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,280
It's okay.

103
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,600
Let him rest well.

104
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,480
Mr. Mo is really punctual.

105
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,120
You can leave now.

106
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,520
The Dunwu Festival

107
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,280
is coming.

108
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,320
Qingchuan.

109
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,800
You're back.

110
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,360
Mother.

111
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,120
I'm back.

112
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,080
Mother.

113
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:57,780
가� mega

114
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:01,220
Mother.

115
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:12,300
Shichuan.

116
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,240
Shichuan.

117
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,760
Are you okay?

118
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,300
I'm okay, Mother.

119
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,020
I was right.

120
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,980
Right.

121
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,060
This isn't real.

122
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,000
Do you okay?

123
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,720
You should bring Mom to hospital for Tipsy.

124
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,800
Mom.

125
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,560
How painful you should be!

126
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,840
I'm fine.

127
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,560
I'll take you away, okay?

128
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,920
Okay.

129
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,640
Okay.

130
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,720
Qingchuan.

131
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,440
It's been a long time since you came back.

132
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,080
I've seen your uncle

133
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,520
and the current head of the Mo family.

134
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,640
You don't even greet me?

135
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,280
Are you worthy of it?

136
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,440
You escaped alone.

137
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,440
The Mo family's business has been ruined overnight.

138
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,840
The Mo family's army has been defeated and scattered.

139
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,320
Everyone is in a state of panic.

140
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,720
It's me

141
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,360
who lost my only son.

142
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,520
I'll make up for your mistakes

143
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,880
and ask for your grace.

144
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,560
Otherwise, your mother,

145
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,840
your father, and your brother

146
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,720
will all be killed.

147
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,160
Forget it.

148
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,960
I'm just an uncle.

149
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,280
I don't want to be repaid.

150
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,160
But after you came back,

151
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,960
the Mo family, who finally cleared up,

152
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,200
has to be tainted again.

153
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,360
You're too insensible.

154
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,840
You're so arrogant.

155
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,040
You're pretending to be a human.

156
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,120
You sneaked back to the capital.

157
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,400
I can take it as an ungrateful act.

158
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,360
But you have to promise me

159
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,640
that you'll never come back.

160
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,200
Otherwise,

161
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,600
my sister-in-law will still be in my Taiwei Mansion

162
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,640
and will be in the capital for the rest of her life.

163
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,760
Mother, don't listen to the dog's nonsense.

164
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,880
Let's go.

165
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,960
Come on.

166
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:10,840
Don't be afraid.

167
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
Mo Qingchuan.

168
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,360
Have you forgotten your identity?

169
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,840
You're a traitor who betrayed the country.

170
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,720
A traitor?

171
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,760
Are you talking about yourself?

172
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,040
You're using the Mo family's bones as a bait.

173
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,560
You're using the blood of the people of Qingchuan

174
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,360
to make a mess of the Taiwei Mansion.

175
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:36,880
You're so arrogant.

176
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,360
May I ask if the Mo family can stay here

177
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,320
and rest in peace every night?

178
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,960
I don't understand what you're talking about.

179
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,040
If you surrender,

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,560
I can consider asking for your mercy

181
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,840
from the Empress Dowager

182
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,720
and spare your life.

183
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,160
You dare to ask me to see the Empress Dowager?

184
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,360
Mo Junyu,

185
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,440
you just want to use my mother

186
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,280
to make a horse and force me to set up the capital.

187
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,480
But my mother is not a horse.

188
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,880
You dare not touch her.

189
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,240
If you stop me again,

190
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,720
I'll kill you right now.

191
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,480
Where is Mo Qingchuan?

192
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,480
Qingchuan, let me go.

193
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,440
I used my secret to make a lie.

194
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,560
General Mo Jushan's old energy suddenly recovered.

195
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,040
There's no cure for the poison.

196
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,520
It's Mo Junyu.

197
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,760
He tampered with the prescription.

198
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,240
It's Mo Junyu who killed General Mo Jushan.

199
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:47,880
I used the prescription to prove it.

200
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,680
I'm not lying.

201
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,680
I'm not lying.

202
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,080
I really want to

203
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,360
kill you right now.

204
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,920
Mother, let's go.

205
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:11,640
Qingchuan,

206
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:14,960
can you

207
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,760
make up for what happened before?

208
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,760
Why do you ask?

209
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,400
Your Highness,

210
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,000
the county magistrates of all states

211
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,400
are here to receive your gift.

212
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,640
They were robbed by the traitors.

213
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,960
What?

214
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,400
The emperor's son

215
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,800
dared to be so arrogant.

216
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,120
He dared to rob the gifts

217
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,720
from all states.

218
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,840
It's ridiculous.

219
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,800
Your Highness, calm down.

220
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,400
Master.

221
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,480
Master, something happened.

222
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,160
What's wrong?

223
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:15,880
Master,

224
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,400
the remaining four court FINALS

225
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,940
can stay here only

226
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,760
for a few days

227
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,080
or even more.

228
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,120
Master,

229
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,160
change your dress.

230
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,360
I'll go save a doctor now.

231
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,080
What's so urgent?

232
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,840
Please let's change the dress.

233
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,680
We'll be back around five o'clock.

234
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,600
to destroy Yunwu Village.

235
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,280
What did you say?

236
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,160
Yunwu Village

237
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,640
has received the Empress Dowager's birthday gift.

238
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,000
The Empress Dowager is furious.

239
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,760
She ordered to take back the birthday gift

240
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,000
within ten days

241
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,320
to see the head of the Yunwu Village owner.

242
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,560
Yunwu Village

243
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,200
How could it be done like this?

244
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,880
Yes.

245
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,080
This is so strange.

246
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,160
Yunwu Village

247
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,920
It's her.

248
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:24,720
Don't worry, Master.

249
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,360
I'll send Madam back to a safe place.

250
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,560
Mother.

251
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,560
alive.

252
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,800
I promise you.

253
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,400
I promise you.

254
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,800
General Cao,

255
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,600
you don't even know who to send

256
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,000
to take over the Yunwu Village?

257
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,800
You've been raising soldiers for thousands of days,

258
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,600
don't you even have a capable person?

259
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,800
It's said that the Yunwu Village is a remote area,

260
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,200
it's hard to attack.

261
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,000
If we can't do it in ten days,

262
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,600
we'll be in danger.

263
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,600
General Cao,

264
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,600
you're right.

265
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,200
I'm not afraid of you.

266
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,800
I'm not afraid of you.

267
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,600
I'm not afraid of you.

268
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,600
I'm not afraid of you.

269
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,600
I'm not afraid of you.

270
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,200
If we can't do it in ten days,

271
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,400
we'll have to come to see you in person.

272
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,600
Who should we send?

273
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,400
Who should we send to take over the Yunwu Village?

274
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,400
It's...

275
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,200
It's Xia Qiguang.

276
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
How could it be him?

277
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,800
If you don't mind,

278
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
Black Armor Army's Xia Qiguang

279
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,400
is willing to take the order.

280
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,200
I really want to

281
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,200
kill you now.

282
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,600
But you can't die yet.

283
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,400
I still have to take you out of the human skin

284
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,400
in front of the world

285
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,800
and take you out of the beast's den.

286
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,000
Yes.

287
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

288
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,000
Congratulations, Xia Fuwei.

289
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,800
You've got the power to unify the army

290
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,400
after you've been promoted to the rank of the official.

291
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Thank you, General Cao.

292
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,400
I'd like to see

293
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,800
how long you can sit in the position of the deputy commander.

294
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,200
There are ten people in the army

295
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,000
who are busy.

296
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
I can only give you ten people to pay for your expenses.

297
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Ten people?

298
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
General Cao,

299
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
you want me to die?

300
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
No, no, no.

301
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
I think Xia Fuwei

302
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,600
is a good fighter.

303
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,800
He can unify the army.

304
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,600
He's just a Yunwu Village.

305
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,000
He doesn't need to be in the position of the official.

306
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
When you die in Yunwu Village

307
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,200
and get rid of the Empress Dowager,

308
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,200
I'll take the advantage.

309
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
Isn't that great?

310
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Or you want to fight with Tang Gu.

311
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,200
You can report to the Empress Dowager

312
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,200
that you don't have the ability.

313
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,200
Xia Fuwei,

314
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
do you want to fight?

315
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,800
I agree.

316
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,200
But can I be confident

317
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,200
in my position?

318
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,200
As you wish.

319
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
Hurry.

320
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
Follow up.

321
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Yunwu Village is ahead.

322
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,200
Let's take a break.

323
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,200
We'll wait for one person.

324
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,200
Okay, let's take a break.

325
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
Xia Qigong,

326
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
why are you taking me?

327
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:00,200
Of course, because Brother Shi Tou is good at martial arts.

328
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,200
I admire him.

329
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Who is it?

330
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
Go.

331
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,200
Greetings, Mr. Mo.

332
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Please rise.

333
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,200
So they are the people you summoned.

334
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,200
The first thing the Crown Prince came to the camp

335
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
was to rescue us one by one.

336
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,200
I dare not change the teaching.

337
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,200
Whether I'm here or not,

338
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
you must remember this.

339
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,200
Protect him and listen to his orders.

340
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,200
Yes.

341
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
I will be the military counselor.

342
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,200
The first task is to rescue one person.

343
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,200
We are going to take Yunwu's head

344
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,200
and return it to the Empress Dowager.

345
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,200
The Empress Dowager's gift

346
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,200
has been hidden by the general.

347
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,200
My lord,

348
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,200
we have reinforced the barrier.

349
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,200
There is no sign of them on the mountain.

350
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,200
It's really unfair.

351
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:34,200
My lord, even if you give us ten courage,

352
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,200
you dare not take the gift from the Empress Dowager.

353
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,200
It's obviously a disaster.

354
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
The lock of the gate is broken.

355
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,200
The top of the Night Pavilion is completely destroyed.

356
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,200
This military camp

357
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
must be protected no matter what.

358
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,200
This is the map of Yunwu Mountain given by the military.

359
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
The name of this mountain is written on it.

360
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,200
It seems to be hidden in the cloud.

361
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,200
It's impossible to find.

362
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,200
The military camp is between the two peaks.

363
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,200
It's probably in this position.

364
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
The map given is wrong.

365
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,200
There seems to be only one main path in the cloud.

366
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,200
The two sides are bare mountain walls.

367
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,200
The top of the mountain is a dense forest.

368
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
It's hard to attack.

369
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Yesterday, ten silver cicadas entered the cloud.

370
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,200
They split into four directions to investigate the enemy's defense.

371
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,200
They found three secret paths.

372
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:31,200
The real location of the cloud is here.

373
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:36,200
The location of the cloud on the map is a dugout.

374
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,200
If we attack from this location,

375
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,200
if archers are ambushed on the top,

376
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,200
we will be destroyed.

377
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,200
These bastards

378
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,200
are clearly asking us to die.

379
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,200
They know that we only have ten people.

380
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,200
Therefore, on the four roads,

381
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
we are on average.

382
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,200
The army is dense and not easy to deal with.

383
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,200
I don't understand. Mr. Mo.

384
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,200
The military report says that there are only two or three hundred bandits in this mountain.

385
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
The four roads are divided.

386
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,200
There are fifty or sixty people on the road.

387
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,200
But we have twenty-four people.

388
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,200
Can't we break through one by one?

389
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
Yes.

390
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
These days,

391
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,200
everyone is waiting for the original location.

392
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,200
We can't go back to the camp.

393
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,200
But sir,

394
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,200
there are only a dozen of people.

395
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,200
We have two thousand soldiers.

396
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,200
Are you too...

397
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,200
Yes.

398
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,200
This is strange.

399
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,200
There is no empress dowager on the mountain.

400
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,200
Could it be that

401
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,200
she knows that Qinglian is hidden in this mountain?

402
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,200
That person

403
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:48,200
hid two thousand soldiers on the mountain.

404
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,200
To protect Mo Qinglian.

405
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
Two thousand?

406
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Two thousand soldiers?

407
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,200
This road can go to the back of the mountain.

408
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,200
It should be the route they retreat.

409
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,200
My plan is like this.

410
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,200
Sir,

411
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,200
when should we take action?

412
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,200
Wait a little longer.

413
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,200
Sir,

414
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,200
they moved.

415
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,200
Where?

416
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,200
They are on the stone platform

417
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,200
near the main road.

418
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:44,200
They raised their army.

419
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
What does this mean?

420
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,200
How many people are there?

421
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Twelve.

422
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,200
Why is there one more?

423
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,200
There seems to be a strange woman.

424
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
She is tall and has a unique temperament.

425
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
I have never seen her.

426
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,200
She is here.

427
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:03,200
Sir,

428
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,200
should we wait until they show up

429
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,200
and attack?

430
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,200
Are you sure

431
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,200
that there are only twelve of them?

432
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
Absolutely.

433
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,200
What can twelve people do?

434
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,200
Mo Qingchuan used his army to frame us.

435
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
If there is a second move,

436
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,200
it will not be so easy to show up.

437
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,200
No.

438
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Let's wait and see.

439
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,200
Don't show your strength so easily.

440
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,200
Yes, sir.

441
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Sir,

442
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
take the medicine.

443
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,200
The clouds and fog are clear and sunny.

444
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,200
If it weren't for the hidden hook,

445
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,200
it would have been a good scene.

446
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,200
Sir,

447
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
the mountain is just a mountain.

448
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,200
The bad people should die.

449
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,200
But the mountain is innocent.

450
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
You are right.

451
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
No matter who is wrong,

452
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,200
the mountain is still a mountain.

453
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,200
Just like now,

454
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,200
the world is in chaos.

455
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
The world is in chaos.

456
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,200
But the Jinxiu Mountains and Rivers

457
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
of the Xia State

458
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,200
are still worth protecting.

459
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
Sir,

460
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,200
right?

461
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
It's been three days.

462
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,200
Why is there no movement?

463
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,200
What is he playing?

464
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,200
The road of the Chanzi Hao Gate is narrow.

465
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
Did he summon Yuan Shou?

466
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Right.

467
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,200
When Yuan Shou uses this opportunity

468
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,200
to start a fight to save Qinglian,

469
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,200
if not,

470
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,200
why would he be so arrogant

471
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,200
and distract me?

472
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,200
No.

473
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,200
Even if he has Yuan Shou,

474
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,200
I still have 2,000 elite soldiers to suppress.

475
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,200
What can he do to me?

476
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,200
Let's go.

477
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Now,

478
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,200
we'll retreat immediately.

479
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Sir,

480
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,200
they have retreated.

481
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,200
Retreat?

482
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,200
Why?

483
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,200
Maybe

484
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,200
they are worried about the big event tonight.

485
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,200
How did you know?

486
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,200
There are old soldiers in my village

487
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,200
who know the world.

488
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
The world

489
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
is in a bad state.

490
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,200
The climate is getting worse.

491
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,200
The water level is rising.

492
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,200
It's the sign of the big event.

493
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,200
I'm worried

494
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
they will attack at night.

495
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,200
At night?

496
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,200
Right.

497
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:09,200
He must have transferred more troops.

498
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,200
Send two experts

499
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,200
to take him out of the dark gate.

500
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,200
At night,

501
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,200
take him down the mountain from the small road.

502
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,200
Yes.

503
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
Mo Qingchuan.

504
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,200
I have no worries about the future.

505
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
I'll allow you to fight

506
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,200
in this cloudless mountain.

507
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,200
So what?

508
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:32,200
I must kill you

509
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,200
in this cloudless mountain.

510
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,200
What are you doing?

511
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Mo Qingchuan.

512
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,200
Mr. Zhang.

513
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,200
When will we act?

514
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
If it's dawn,

515
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
the five of us will be scattered.

516
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Wait a minute.

517
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,200
My lord.

518
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,200
How is it?

519
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
Nothing happened.

520
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,200
Did he change his mind?

521
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,200
Or we misjudged him?

522
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,200
He didn't plan to make a big mistake.

523
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,200
I don't know.

524
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
But we have to fight day and night.

525
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
We are exhausted.

526
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
Once it's done,

527
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,200
I will reward you.

528
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,200
Thank you, my lord.

529
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,200
Mo Qingchuan.

530
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,200
What are you waiting for?

531
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,200
I forgot to tell my aunt

532
00:28:50,200 --> 00:29:17,400
that the crumble yam

533
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:38,660
motivators and

534
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:39,420
Yes.

535
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:45,900
Retreat!

536
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,860
There are only six people.

537
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,500
Kill them!

538
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,100
Retreat.

539
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:03,700
Kill them task!

540
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,240
Over there!

541
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
There!

542
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,160
Retreat!

543
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:16,840
Go after them!

544
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,120
Hurry!

545
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
They're coming!

546
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,120
Ready to shoot!

547
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
Yes!

548
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,320
What's that sound?

549
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,400
Hurry!

550
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
In front of us!

551
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
This way!

552
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,400
Go after them!

553
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
Yes!

554
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:43,960
Go after them!

555
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
Yes!

556
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,880
Go after them!

557
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,840
Yes!

558
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,200
Go after them!

559
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,200
There!

560
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,200
Go after them!

561
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:09,720
Why are there so many of them?

562
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:12,720
Are they enemies or what?

563
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,000
They're enemies! Shoot!
