they've escaped.

See you in 3 years.

39
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:14,660
Good morning, master.

40
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,940
Mr. Mo.

41
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,940
These days,

42
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,940
I've been dreaming all this time.

43
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,940
I'm dreaming.

44
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:28,940
How is my father?

45
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,940
Jin'ai.

46
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,940
Where is he?

47
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,940
I want to go and see him.

48
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:46,940
I can't see him anymore.

49
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,940
He's burned to ashes.

50
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,940
Why are you doing this?

51
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:55,940
It's just a joke.

52
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,940
It's just a play for the people.

53
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,940
It's just a play for the people.

54
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:01,940
Is it important?

55
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,940
I can see him for the last time.

56
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:08,940
Why are you doing this?

57
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:11,940
For the last time,

58
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:14,940
I've forgotten that you've seen him.

59
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:22,940
Run.

60
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,940
You should remember that.

61
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,940
That's the last time.

62
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,940
Xia Qi Guang.

63
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:38,940
You should choose the path you want to follow.

64
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,940
If you want to live a normal life,

65
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,940
the spring breeze will be with you.

66
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:47,940
You can't live a normal life.

67
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,940
The sun shines on the spring breeze.

68
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:52,940
The moon is so beautiful.

69
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,940
If you want to live a normal life,

70
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,940
you can live a normal life.

71
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,940
You can't live a normal life.

72
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,940
If you want to live a normal life,

73
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,940
you can't live a normal life.

74
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,940
Let's go.

75
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:19,940
Let's go.

76
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,940
If not,

77
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,940
what's more important is to leave you alone.

78
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,940
Convinced by hisي

79
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,940
during my older daughter engaged in compound murder.

80
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,940
I was once a child.

81
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,940
Once a child was engaged in compound murder,

82
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,940
the court might lose that role,

83
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,940
but that's not what happened.

84
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,960
Yu Mei.

85
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,480
The former plan was toQLO

86
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,140
us her FEi.

87
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,400
In the spirit while dying I was shot down,

88
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,620
and the result is this.

89
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:14,240
It was sentenced to�

90
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,240
The people who are in charge of the door are all the dead people of the Ming Dynasty.

91
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,240
There are people in the court who are in charge of the door and are not enough to fight.

92
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:25,240
A fire can cover all the truth, including...

93
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
your death.

94
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:34,240
In the eyes of the world, you are already a dead person.

95
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,240
The enemy is to make you stay in the dark and heal first.

96
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,240
Don't wait until you have the chance to take revenge.

97
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,240
You can't even raise your sword.

98
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,240
Do you understand now, Xia Qigong?

99
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Yes.

100
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,240
Thank you.

101
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,240
You don't have to thank me.

102
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
I will help you now.

103
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,240
I will report to you in the future.

104
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,240
Okay.

105
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,240
Did you just come out of the shower and want to hit me?

106
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
I dare not.

107
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,240
You have no respect for the criminal.

108
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,240
You are seriously injured and out of the shower.

109
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,240
You have been punished for an hour.

110
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,240
What do you mean, I forgot?

111
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,240
It's obviously the Demon King.

112
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,240
Xiang Kui.

113
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,240
Is it hot and pretty?

114
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,240
Have you finished your homework today?

115
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,240
After finishing your homework,

116
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,240
you can take this batch of herbs and small firewood for four hours.

117
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
Watch carefully.

118
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,240
Be good.

119
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,240
You are so tired.

120
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,240
You are so tired.

121
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,240
How is it?

122
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,240
Did you finish your homework?

123
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,240
I was hit by the ground.

124
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,240
I was so happy.

125
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,240
You must have said something wrong to offend him.

126
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,240
It's a big deal.

127
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,240
I have lost my job.

128
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,240
But I don't want to lose my job.

129
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Qi Guang.

130
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,240
You know there are three kinds of people in this world.

131
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,240
You can't be so stupid.

132
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,240
You are a monster, a lunatic, and a dead man.

133
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,240
Guess which kind of person he belongs to.

134
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
A lunatic?

135
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,240
A lunatic.

136
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,240
A lunatic.

137
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,240
He is a lunatic.

138
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:43,240
If he has a king, he will only have him.

139
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:45,240
But Qi Guang.

140
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:50,240
He is a person who is absolutely trustworthy.

141
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,240
Come on.

142
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,240
Young General.

143
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,240
Your martial arts...

144
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,240
I have suffered some injuries.

145
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,240
I was exhausted.

146
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:33,240
You are a good person.

147
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
When I get back to the Mo's Army one day,

148
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
I will definitely beat them to the ground.

149
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,240
You haven't changed at all.

150
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
It's been a long time since I saw you, Qi Yun.

151
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,240
Mo's Army, the first commander of the Alliance, Qi Yun.

152
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,240
Greetings, Young General.

153
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,240
Get up.

154
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,240
Yes, Young General.

155
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Qi Yun.

156
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,240
The Mo's Army has been called the four-year military service.

157
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,240
Don't call me that.

158
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
Just call me Mr. Mo.

159
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,240
I received the contact of the Young General.

160
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,240
I came out of the Army.

161
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,240
I accompanied the Chansi Army to collect the news in the capital.

162
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
It's so long.

163
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,240
Can I wait until the day the capital is back?

164
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,240
This is the handbook of the Chansi Army.

165
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,240
Take a closer look.

166
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,240
From today on,

167
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,240
you will be the head of the capital.

168
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,240
Yes.

169
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
Just do business at the door.

170
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,240
Don't scare my guests away.

171
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,240
Yes.

172
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,240
Qi Yun, listen to me.

173
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
Yes.

174
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,240
Order you to collect the news in the capital

175
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,240
and protect the business.

176
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Don't expose it.

177
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
This is military power.

178
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,240
Yes.

179
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
Did the news come out?

180
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,240
Yes.

181
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,240
Now everyone knows that

182
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,240
the great leader of the Chansi Army is not the Prince of Jing.

183
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
He is a person called Mo Wang.

184
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,240
The first wife of the world in his life.

185
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Good.

186
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,240
After the prince returns,

187
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,240
the innocent orphan will be deeply in love.

188
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,240
The court has been in a state of displeasure.

189
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,240
If she reaches the lock door,

190
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,240
she will be sent to the army.

191
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
This is the specific situation of the lock door.

192
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Li Zhenzhen's return to the capital is not far away.

193
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,240
How is my mother?

194
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,240
Madam, she is still under the command of the Taiwei Talisman.

195
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,240
If there is a chance,

196
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,240
Young General, go back and report to the peace.

197
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,240
And then,

198
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,240
I will visit my uncle, the Taiwei Talisman.

199
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,240
Mo Taiwei, you are so virtuous.

200
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,240
You are so busy with the fire.

201
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,240
You even have a new job.

202
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,240
Think of a way.

203
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,240
What fire?

204
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,240
This is a good opportunity for the Li Xia Palace.

205
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
If I were you,

206
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,240
I would have been willing to take the lock door

207
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,240
with the empress dowager.

208
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,240
And then?

209
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,240
Catch them and report to the king.

210
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,240
Who said they would catch them?

211
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,240
They all killed them.

212
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,240
They wasted so much time on these dead bodies.

213
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,240
They all died.

214
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,240
It's too wasteful.

215
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,240
I have heard from Wei's family that

216
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,240
the fire was burned in the four states of Yi.

217
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,240
But the person who was on the tree beside the dead body

218
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,240
was the one who locked the door.

219
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,240
No one could find out.

220
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,240
The lock door

221
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,240
must have been kept.

222
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,240
Who left the clue?

223
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
Of course, someone controlled it.

224
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
General Shao can take the lead

225
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,240
and make a big contribution.

226
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,240
It's better than

227
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,240
being in trouble with others.

228
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,240
Am I right?

229
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,240
Do you still hurt?

230
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,240
A little bit.

231
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,240
To be honest,

232
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
it hurts.

233
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,240
I can't move.

234
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,240
Your hand is almost broken.

235
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,240
You can only rest.

236
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
I can't move.

237
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,240
I can't move.

238
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,240
I can't move.

239
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,240
I can't move.

240
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,240
I can't move.

241
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,240
I can't move.

242
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,240
I can only rest.

243
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,240
I have a good medical skill for my uncle.

244
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,240
If I have a chance to meet him,

245
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
I'll take you to see him.

246
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,240
Don't worry.

247
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,240
He will be fine.

248
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,240
Give me your left hand.

249
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,240
The internal heat is stable.

250
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,240
You can start to practice.

251
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,240
How?

252
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,240
Left hand.

253
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,240
Jiang Kui.

254
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,240
Use the light to activate the muscles.

255
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,240
Okay.

256
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,240
Don't hit bad things.

257
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,240
I can't control it.

258
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:03,240
Don't hit if you can't control it.

259
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,240
Okay, one more time.

260
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
I'll use my left hand.

261
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,240
I can't move.

262
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,240
I can't move.

263
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,240
You can learn it from me.

264
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,240
You can learn it from me.

265
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,240
If it's my red lotus,

266
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,240
you're dead.

267
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,240
It's okay, little brother.

268
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,240
You're still talented.

269
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
What's wrong with your practice?

270
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,240
This is for you.

271
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
You're not good enough.

272
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,240
I'm not good enough.

273
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
You're not good enough.

274
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,240
One.

275
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
One.

276
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,240
Only one.

277
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
Only one.

278
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,240
I can't move.

279
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,240
You can learn it from me.

280
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,240
One.

281
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
One.

282
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
Only one.

283
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,240
I can't move.

284
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:25,240
You can learn it from me.

285
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,240
You can learn from me.

286
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,240
Three.

287
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,240
One.

288
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,240
Just like the rain in the west.

289
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Like the wind in the mountain.

290
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,240
Two.

291
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,240
One.

292
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
Just like the wind in the mountain.

293
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,240
Three.

294
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,240
One.

295
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,240
Only one.

296
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,960
I heard that you've been in the martial arts world for a long time.

297
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:43,560
You won't be able to see the martial arts world. I'll send you off.

298
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:44,560
Okay.

299
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,760
This is fine too.

300
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,600
Keep practicing.

301
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
Don't go out and embarrass me.

302
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,800
Thank you.

303
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,600
Thank you, Mr. Mo.

304
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,440
I really can't believe that you've been practicing in the martial arts world.

305
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,440
Little Junior Brother, good morning.

306
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,040
Good morning.

307
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,040
Left hand.

308
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,040
The door is open.

309
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
I can't open it.

310
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
I'll open it.

311
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,040
I'll open it.

312
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,040
I'll open it.

313
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
I'll open it.

314
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,040
I'll open it.

315
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,040
I'll open it.

316
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
I'll open it.

317
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:26,040
I'll open it.

318
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
I can't open it.

319
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,480
When Master forced me to practice the martial arts world, I didn't have to use my left hand.

320
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,000
But Master said that I was suitable to force me to practice.

321
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,880
But after I finished practicing, I found that I was better than before.

322
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,360
Is there any way to do it faster?

323
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,360
Of course there is.

324
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,160
Practice more.

325
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,280
But your injury is just right.

326
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,760
You have to come slowly.

327
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,120
By the way, Master is coming back soon.

328
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,640
I'll cook for Master.

329
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,200
Yes.

330
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,600
Mr. Mo went out?

331
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,960
Yes.

332
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,200
Master goes to the bamboo forest to collect bones every day.

333
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,000
It's time to come back and eat breakfast and read books.

334
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,800
You don't have to compare with him.

335
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,600
He is a devil.

336
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Mr. Mo tillers conditioning village

337
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,320
Take a break for a while.

338
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,800
If you get hurt, I'll take the White 바 ASA.

339
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,200
Thank you.

340
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:59,200
It's true that you have improved.

341
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
No, you're still practicing.

342
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,200
Master is back.

343
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200
Master, master, master.

344
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,200
Master, you're back.

345
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,200
Junior brother didn't listen to me.

346
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,200
But he's been practicing the sword.

347
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,200
Just go with him.

348
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,200
Master, you're lying.

349
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,200
Thank you, master.

350
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
Master, thank you.

351
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,200
Go pack up after eating.

352
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,200
Okay, where are you going?

353
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,200
Lock the door.

354
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,200
You're going with me.

355
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
But rest well tonight.

356
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,200
The sky will be clear.

357
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Okay.

358
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Why isn't he coming yet?

359
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,200
It's time to send him off.

360
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
Master, when will you start?

361
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,200
I haven't come yet.

362
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
Wait a minute.

363
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,200
Master, you're back.

364
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:21,200
He's going to take a night off.

365
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,200
Okay.

366
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
Master, here you are.

367
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
You eat too.

368
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Why are you sitting here?

369
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,200
I'm going to take a night off.

370
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,200
I'm going to take a night off.

371
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,200
It's the last night of the King's incident.

372
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,200
I took a fire.

373
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,200
The lock-and-lock door was blocked.

374
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,200
So they need to be removed.

375
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,200
Today is the day the court takes it.

376
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
It's the day the lock-and-lock door

377
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,200
takes the treatment.

378
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,200
What a coincidence.

379
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,200
It's a ghost.

380
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,400
Yes.

381
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,960
Someone's coming.

382
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,360
What did you just say?

383
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,160
Father's death

384
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
must be taught by the court.

385
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,160
The court has sent people to arrest him.

386
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,400
If everything goes as planned,

387
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,000
we don't have to move.

388
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,920
But if we use the name of the criminal

389
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,200
to kill him,

390
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,400
the person sent by the court

391
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,000
will be the evil ghost

392
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,400
that the Cao family has hidden.

393
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,800
Father...

394
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,500
Cao Lingan

395
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,000
Yes.

396
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,960
年的军审死是密封老师

397
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,880
Who is this general?

398
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,120
You know Chairman Mu?

399
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,120
I don't know him. Just call me if you want.

400
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,120
The Great Xia Valley is really a mess.

401
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,120
Go, Jiang Kui. Be careful.

402
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,120
Junior, let me show you my Ghost Shadow Sect.

403
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,120
He's so good at this.

404
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,120
In terms of his skills, he's a good player.

405
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,120
He can't even touch his medical skills.

406
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
Damn it.

407
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,120
Two people are behind this.

408
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,120
It's so troublesome to kill them in advance.

409
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,120
Who's that?

410
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
Who are you?

411
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,120
Your little grandma.

412
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
Kill her.

413
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:34,120
You stole my grandma's head?

414
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
Who are you?

415
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,120
Xia Qigong?

416
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,120
So he's the one behind this.

417
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,120
Who is he?

418
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,120
Xia Qigong, I've come to arrest Prince Jing for murder.

419
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:18,120
Since you're alive, you can go back with me and the Empress Dowager.

420
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,120
It's not too late.

421
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,120
Now, follow me.

422
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,120
Why are you doing this to my father?

423
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,120
I don't understand what you're talking about.

424
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:35,120
Qigong, do you want to try the swordplay?

425
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,120
Xia Qigong, you dare to take my swordplay?

426
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,120
Use the broken medical skill to move the needle.

427
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,120
The broken medical skill is like a cloud in the sky.

428
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,120
It's like a wind.

429
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,120
Don't, don't, don't.

430
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,120
Xia Qigong, you have something to discuss.

431
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:22,120
It's you who killed my father.

432
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,120
Qigong.

433
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,120
He can't die.

434
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,120
Cao Ling'an, is Prince Jing's family under your command?

435
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
No.

436
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,120
How much money do you need to buy a meal?

437
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,120
10,000 taels.

438
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,120
So many people are all silver.

439
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,120
They're all here to kill you.

440
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,120
Your heart must be hurt.

441
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Yes.

442
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
Yes.

443
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,120
You're the one who locked the door behind you?

444
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
Yes.

445
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
Only you?

446
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,120
Who else is behind you?

447
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,120
You're the one who locked the door behind you?

448
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,120
The lock-and-lock thing has been broken.

449
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,120
I'm going to the capital next step.

450
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
What about you?

451
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,120
But Qigong is definitely a trusted person.

452
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,120
God of Evil, please forgive me.

453
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,120
Please protect me, Lord Sword.

454
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,120
I'd best meet you in Qingxin Village.

455
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,640
You've already become my disciple.

456
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:57,840
Get up.

457
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,640
You really have a little junior now.

458
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,360
Call me Senior Sister.

459
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,400
Senior Sister.

460
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,320
Master. Master. Master.

461
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,320
Go ahead.

462
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,920
But Qi Guang,

463
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,840
you need to stop the revenge.

464
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,320
Why?

465
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,600
Now, it's a magic knife for the enemy.

466
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,640
It's done in two ways.

467
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,080
One, it's done with revenge.

468
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,880
One, it's the trust of the Empress Dowager

469
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,360
to take the throne.

470
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,160
Two, it's the position of the Black Armor Army

471
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,480
and the General.

472
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,560
Second,

473
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,560
there's a suspicious place.

474
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,560
Why?

475
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,080
The Black Armor Army

476
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,200
is just the position of the Mohists in the capital.

477
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,040
Look at the so-called

478
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,880
Black Armor Army, the General, Cao Ling'an.

479
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,240
It's just a disguise.

480
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,400
What does the Yizhi Army look like?

481
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,280
It can be determined by the commander.

482
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:10,280
Am I right?

483
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,920
Yes, Master.

484
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,160
Master,

485
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,080
there's no clue inside.

486
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,600
The card is just hidden.

487
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,800
It's so cruel.

488
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:31,720
It's okay.

489
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,320
I have a lot of people to deal with.

490
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,600
Since there's no clue,

491
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,640
I can use this Young General

492
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,200
to pick up a piece.

493
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,640
As for such a dirty place,

494
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,920
burn it.

495
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,800
Yes.

496
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,440
stocks are no more.

497
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,640
We can just make it.

498
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,000
Allow Mann noodles.

499
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,360
Remove the seed,

500
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:07,720
I will go and search again?

501
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,080
It has been twelve years.

502
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,620
Mei Lv, Y купis,

503
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:26,500
upon running web

504
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,880
then ghost will kill me.

505
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:28,520
Great,

506
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,080
I'm glad to find you.

507
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,760
Unexpectedly,

508
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,160
I dare not to talk to Cao Ling an.

509
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:39,160
It means that the person behind him is more dangerous than death.

510
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,160
And such a person is in the lower court.

511
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,160
He needs to be punished.

512
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:48,160
I'm not guilty.
