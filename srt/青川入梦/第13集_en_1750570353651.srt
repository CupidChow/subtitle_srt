1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,680
Descend into a Tomb

2
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:15,880
Leadingужд for QingChuan

3
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,700
offended by hides

4
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,700
You must wait for the high-ranking official to come.

5
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,700
Why do you do this?

6
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,700
Mo's Family...

7
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,700
I won't let you.

8
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,700
Wait.

9
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,700
Leave.

10
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,700
I'm sorry.

11
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,700
Mo's Family is gone.

12
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:16,700
Empress Dowager Cao has issued a decree.

13
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,700
Mo's Family is famous.

14
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,700
The title is issued.

15
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,700
From now on, it's only the Black Armor Army.

16
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:45,700
Do you want revenge?

17
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:52,700
I'll let you take revenge.

18
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,700
I heard that the State of Chu's envoy is coming to the capital.

19
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,700
It's just a coincidence.

20
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,700
It's just a change of events.

21
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,700
The natural disaster is not a big deal.

22
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,700
It's just a matter of time.

23
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,700
Stop crying.

24
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,700
Summon the Chu people.

25
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,700
We have to eat the children.

26
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,700
Mo Qingchuan.

27
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,700
What are you going to do with this?

28
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,700
Hand it to me.

29
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,700
I want Mo's Family.

30
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,700
Let the Black Armor Army select the field.

31
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,700
If you save me,

32
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,700
I'll get lots of money.

33
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,700
I'll win.

34
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,700
Give me an excuse.

35
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,340
I can kill one more person,

36
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,980
but I can't kill

37
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,100
ten thousand,

38
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:56,700
or ten thousand.

39
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,860
One more person

40
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,100
is enough.

41
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,700
General, be careful!

42
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,180
I have come across you

43
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,420
on this mountain edge.

44
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,100
Let's have a while

45
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,900
in this Xiu Luo Wall.

46
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,180
What is there to talk about?

47
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,420
Rebels praise 흐

48
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,820
evil and evil talking

49
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,640
hero

50
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,020
andress

51
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,900
evil

52
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:42,560
and evilov

53
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:44,820
When you blasted away

54
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,620
with your cost of death soaring,

55
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,620
But Qingchuan is in danger.

56
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,460
You are not defeated by our army.

57
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,860
You are defeated by the people.

58
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,060
Who is the traitor?

59
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,700
You want to know?

60
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,180
Live on.

61
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,780
You will meet each other eventually.

62
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,820
You will see the future as the right one.

63
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,900
And the heaven as the traitor.

64
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,740
Maybe you can seek justice for yourself.

65
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:32,380
Justice?

66
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:36,300
Justice is not justice under the power.

67
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:39,940
Master.

68
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,220
Say it aloud.

69
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,540
You are to blame.

70
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,060
Master.

71
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,460
Look.

72
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,420
Fl consumes tail of summer.

73
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,900
You should practice your martial arts.

74
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,900
Why did you go to catch fireflies?

75
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,900
My mother told me when I was a kid

76
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,900
that if you get lost in the dark

77
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,900
and follow the direction of fireflies,

78
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,900
you can go home.

79
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,900
The night passes by like a starlight

80
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:42,900
and you are the only one who is in the fire.

81
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:50,900
I am the one who is brave to fight against the chaos.

82
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:55,900
I will write a letter to draw your outline.

83
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,900
The night is like a firefly.

84
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:07,900
Who is the one who is silent?

85
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,900
Master, let's go home.

86
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:20,900
The last time, the pain of love and hate is locked.

87
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,900
There is an unexpected guest.

88
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,900
You have arrived for three days.

89
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:48,900
It has been three years.

90
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,900
Long time no see.

91
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,900
Qi Guang, I have seen you before.

92
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,900
I don't know if you are my friend.

93
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,900
I was rude to you.

94
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,900
You are indeed rude.

95
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,900
I have come to see the six sons of Chu.

96
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:14,900
The general is in the left side of the battle.

97
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,900
The enemy of my Xia is Feng Shiyan.

98
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,900
Feng Shiyan.

99
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,900
It seems that you have been poisoned by yourself.

100
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,900
I am worried that you will die in the corner of the Xia.

101
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,900
I have carried your heavy burden.

102
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,900
How can I fall on the ground?

103
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,900
It must be painful at that time.

104
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:47,900
I am a person who knows the truth.

105
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:53,900
One day, you will suffer from the pain of being hurt by the sword.

106
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,900
You will tell me if it is painful.

107
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,900
But if everything is repeated,

108
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,900
I will not be soft.

109
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:16,900
If you come out soon, I am certain you are my friend!

110
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:37,900
If it is the time of death,

111
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,900
kill the ones that honors it.

112
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,900
Why did I buy a sugar-coated deer?

113
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,900
It's so lively.

114
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,900
Sand paper.

115
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,900
This bitch.

116
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,900
I hate it when people break my pot!

117
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,900
Enough.

118
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,900
Enough.

119
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,900
I can't stand it anymore.

120
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,900
It's not enough.

121
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,900
I'll go and buy some sugar-coated deer.

122
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,900
I'll go and buy some sugar-coated deer.

123
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,900
I'll go and buy some sugar-coated deer.

124
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,900
I won't.

125
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:19,900
Two days later,

126
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:23,900
I'll take the delegation to the palace to meet the Empress Dowager.

127
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,900
Then we can have a drink.

128
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,900
I hope you don't forget.

129
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,900
You and I.

130
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:44,900
I won't forget.

131
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,900
I don't dare to forget.

132
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:07,900
What's the deal with Master?

133
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,900
Master,

134
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,900
what kind of monster is that?

135
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,900
It looks like it has some ability.

136
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,900
Chu used honey to feed a group of children.

137
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,900
It's a killing tool.

138
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,900
It's very dangerous.

139
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,900
You have to be careful.

140
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
Keep an eye on it.

141
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,900
Yes.

142
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,900
I hope you don't forget.

143
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,900
You and I.

144
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,900
Don't forget.

145
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,900
Don't forget.

146
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,900
The envoy of Chu is here.

147
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,900
Your Majesty.

148
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:43,900
Your Majesty.

149
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,900
The envoy of Chu, Feng Shiyue,

150
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,900
greets Your Majesty and Empress Dowager.

151
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,900
Why is it so rude?

152
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,900
How dare he talk like this?

153
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:03,900
Since the envoy came for peace,

154
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,900
he should join the family.

155
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,900
Your Majesty is old and weak.

156
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,900
Can you tell me the reason?

157
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,900
You...

158
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:15,900
Your Majesty,

159
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,900
the envoy is willing to do everything

160
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:20,900
for the peace of the two countries.

161
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
The saint said that

162
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,900
it's not good to have a far-away friend.

163
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:28,900
I think compared to these small things,

164
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,900
the peace of the two countries is more important.

165
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:34,900
Yes.

166
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,900
We can't hurt the peace of the two countries.

167
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,900
Yes.

168
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Peace is the most important thing.

169
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,900
Then...

170
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,900
Then give the envoy a seat.

171
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,900
I have to tell you.

172
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,900
The emperor is the emperor.

173
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,900
100,000 eggs and grains every year.

174
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,900
50,000 batches of silk.

175
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,900
100,000 golds and grains.

176
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,900
100,000 tea leaves.

177
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,900
Are you here to make peace or to break the law?

178
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,900
Don't be rude.

179
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
Your Majesty.

180
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,900
Empress Dowager.

181
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,900
If so,

182
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,900
the peace will be a city.

183
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,900
The people can't live.

184
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:19,900
Yes.

185
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,900
After the disaster,

186
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,900
the people will be homeless and hungry.

187
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,900
Now we can't get even 30% of the grains

188
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,900
from the treaty.

189
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:29,900
Yes.

190
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,900
Yes.

191
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,900
Your Majesty, Empress Dowager.

192
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,900
This is a disgraceful treaty.

193
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,900
You can't agree to it.

194
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Your Majesty, Empress Dowager.

195
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,900
You can't.

196
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
Shijie.

197
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,900
The conditions of the treaty

198
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,900
are almost doubled as last time.

199
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,900
It's not good.

200
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,900
The treaty must be mutual.

201
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,900
Chu needs to increase the grain and silk.

202
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,900
As a exchange,

203
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,900
we can solve the problem of the weak horse.

204
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,900
How?

205
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,900
10,000 Chu soldiers can guard the four rivers of Xia.

206
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:04,900
It will be safe and stable.

207
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:05,900
Ridiculous.

208
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,900
Chu is in the border.

209
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,900
What does it mean to be in the city with a wolf?

210
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,900
What does it mean to us, the people of Xia,

211
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,900
and the fish and meat in the field?

212
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,900
How can you be willing to die to see the army?

213
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,900
Lord He.

214
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,900
Lord He.

215
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,900
What are you doing?

216
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,900
Prime Minister.

217
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,900
Prime Minister.

218
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,900
They are all pretending to be asleep.

219
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:31,900
I want to see if my blood can wake them up.

220
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,900
Lord He.

221
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,900
Calm down.

222
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,900
Qi Yue, Wuyi, Yu Zi, run together.

223
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,900
Who runs with me?

224
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,900
He?

225
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,900
They?

226
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,900
Or you?

227
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,900
The road to the imperial power is already tight.

228
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,900
Why do you want to die?

229
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:52,900
If there is a way to live, who is willing to die?

230
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,900
There is one way to live.

231
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
The two countries are in alliance.

232
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,900
The agreement can be reduced by 30%.

233
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,900
The Wu Dynasty is willing to take Qin Jin.

234
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:18,900
But I don't know which princess of your country is it.

235
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,900
It's not a princess.

236
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,900
It's not a princess?

237
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,900
Princess?

238
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,900
That's a princess.

239
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,900
The Sixth Prince of Chu, Zifeng Shi Ye,

240
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,900
wants to marry the next general.

241
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,900
Mo Qingchuan.

242
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
You want to exchange for peace.

243
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,900
You want to kill the war.

244
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,900
How can you do this?

245
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,900
General Qingchuan.

246
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,900
The war can be reduced by 40%.

247
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,900
It's not a big deal.

248
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,900
Chu is sincere.

249
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,900
It's a matter of time.

250
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,900
Your Majesty, Empress Dowager,

251
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,900
please consider it.

252
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,900
Your Majesty.

253
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,900
I'm sorry.

254
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,900
I'm sorry.

255
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,900
I'm sorry.

256
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,900
Your Majesty, why do you suddenly want to marry Mo Qingchuan?

257
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,900
The King of Qin is looking forward to this trip.

258
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,900
I thought Your Highness

259
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,900
was deliberately raising the peace treaty of Tang.

260
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,900
It's a test.

261
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,900
If the next country agrees,

262
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,900
it's not a waste of money to get the three cities.

263
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,900
Now,

264
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,900
you want to exchange for Mo Qingchuan.

265
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,900
Such a good plan.

266
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,900
Is it worth it?

267
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,900
Your Highness is responsible for the attack.

268
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,900
The war is fierce.

269
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,900
After this,

270
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,900
even the Second Prince

271
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,900
can't compete with you.

272
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,900
The battlefield changes rapidly.

273
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,900
Don't be careless.

274
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,900
The three sons of the Mo family

275
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,900
are seriously ill.

276
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,900
The Mo family has been out of food for several days.

277
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,900
The war horse is divided into ten.

278
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,900
If you don't get out of the village,

279
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,900
there will be a big victory.

280
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,900
Once the son is dead,

281
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,900
Your Highness will be promoted.

282
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,900
The leader is going to be killed.

283
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,900
The leader is going to be killed.

284
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,900
The leader is going to be killed.

285
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,900
Hurry up.

286
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,900
Hurry up.

287
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:42,900
Your Highness,

288
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,900
why is the leader killed?

289
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,900
The leader was killed by the blood on the mountain.

290
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,900
He was killed on the spot.

291
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,900
The Mo family is dead.

292
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,900
Who did it?

293
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,900
Who?

294
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,900
Stop.

295
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
Stop.

296
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
Mo Qingchuan.

297
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,900
Mo Qingchuan

298
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
Mo Qingchuan

299
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,900
You said you used him to exchange the three cities for five provinces.

300
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:17,900
I don't know.

301
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,900
But I don't know how it will end.

302
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,900
It's a loss.

303
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,900
I hope so.

304
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,900
After the peace talk,

305
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,900
Your Highness's plan can also be done.

306
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
Of course.

307
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,900
Your Highness.

308
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,900
Su Qi,

309
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,900
what do you think?

310
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,900
You know,

311
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,900
I like to hear stories about the death of my family.

312
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,900
General Mo

313
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,900
is a good-looking woman

314
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:48,900
with a good reputation.

315
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,900
Mo Qingchuan

316
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,900
is a man of blood,

317
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,900
and has the highest position.

318
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,900
You think he is a man of blood,

319
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,900
and has the highest position.

320
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,900
You only have a family name.

321
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:07,900
I'm not sure about what you're going to teach me.

322
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:12,900
The whole court is discussing about the war.

323
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,900
Mo Qingchuan's identity is special.

324
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,900
If he is to be the condition of a marriage,

325
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,900
I'm afraid it will cause the court to criticize him.

326
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,900
What do you mean?

327
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,900
Su Qi,

328
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:34,900
do you know why Wu loves Juhua?

329
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,900
Because

330
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:38,900
she is beautiful.

331
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,900
In the old days of Yongping,

332
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,900
when the golden wind was blowing,

333
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,900
the day of the final attack was set.

334
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,900
The Holy Grandfather took Wu to that road.

335
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,900
On that road,

336
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,900
the golden field was covered with bright clouds.

337
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:04,900
It must be beautiful.

338
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,900
Yes, it's beautiful.

339
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,900
The snow outside

340
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
and the water in Qingchuan

341
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,900
are all better than

342
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,900
that golden field.

343
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,900
The Golden Field

344
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,900
Is it Qi Guang?

345
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,900
Yes.

346
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,900
Master,

347
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,900
Feng Shiye visited me the night before.

348
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,900
Today, he was in the court.

349
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,900
I want to ask you

350
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:14,900
what is the agreement between you and Feng Shiye?

351
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,900
When you arrive in the capital,

352
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,900
I'll take a antidote for those who have been looking for me for three months.

353
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,900
Don't blame me.

354
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,900
If not,

355
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,900
I'm afraid I can't find you again.

356
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,900
Okay.

357
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,900
Three years of the court is not over yet.

358
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,900
I'll let you take the revenge.

359
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,900
Don't forget.

360
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,900
When you kill all your enemies,

361
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,900
marry me.

362
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,900
Go.

363
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,900
Go.

364
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
What do you think?

365
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,900
What is it?

366
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:07,900
I don't know.

367
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
You seem to have never asked

368
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:12,900
how I came back from Chu.

369
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,900
Is it Feng Shiye?

370
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,900
Yes.

371
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,900
How ridiculous.

372
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:49,860
The one who survived the

373
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,900
Qi Guang,

374
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,900
is it true?

375
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,900
When Feng Shiye proposed

376
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,900
to use me to exchange for Dr. Wu,

377
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,900
did you see their eyes?

378
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,900
Do you think the Empress Dowager will let this chance go?

379
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,900
It turns out that

380
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,900
as a result,

381
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,900
I Dead valley

382
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,900
an innocent girl

383
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,900
was captured by their hands.

384
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,900
But

385
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,900
my parents

386
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,900
used me

387
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,900
to trade for the結果.

388
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,940
Mo Jun and I

389
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,900
had the hope

390
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:34,900
that

391
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,680
it was definitely

392
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:39,900
Heדa醒

393
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,340
I'm not a good daughter.

394
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:45,220
My father taught me not to regret the past

395
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,020
and to only think about what's in my heart.

396
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,740
But recently,

397
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,100
I've been thinking

398
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,420
if I knew this would happen,

399
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,420
if I knew this would happen,

400
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,140
why would my father and brother die?

401
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,700
If I knew this would happen,

402
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,340
why would my family be destroyed?

403
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,220
If I knew this would happen,

404
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:25,820
Master,

405
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:29,820
the martial arts are the right thing to do.

406
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,740
But justice is in the heart.

407
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,620
Justice?

408
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,220
Justice can't be seen or touched.

409
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,460
But my whole life

410
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
is suffering.

411
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,500
I'm not afraid of death.

412
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,300
But why?

413
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,980
Why should I be the only one suffering?

414
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,180
The year I was born,

415
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,340
the day I turned around,

416
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,020
I was back to the old days.

417
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,900
I was born again,

418
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:58,820
but I can't go back to my hometown.

419
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,700
What can I do

420
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,460
to make you feel better?

421
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,180
Tell me.

422
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,020
I'll do it for you.

423
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,740
You can't help me.

424
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:34,140
Can you seal the oath?

425
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,100
Ye here?

426
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,740
It's the next round.

427
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,340
Hold your breath.

428
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:40,140
Come on.

429
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,180
Come on.

430
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,540
Just go.

431
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:49,900
I hope you can

432
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:52,740
stand up to justice

433
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,300
in the retreat

434
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,540
in the temple.

435
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,140
Master,

436
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,140
I'm sorry.

437
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,900
Since you're disappointed with the court,

438
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,620
and you hate me,

439
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,900
why don't you agree to marry me?

440
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,820
I agreed to marry you,

441
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,700
but I didn't agree to be your pawn.

442
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,460
I want to be your pawn.

443
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,420
To make others

444
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,260
swallow the fruit of their hard work,

445
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:44,940
you need to have a harder fruit first.

446
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,900
You're just a mindless man.

447
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,460
You think I'm your son,

448
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,380
but you set a time limit.

449
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:54,260
You're just trying to get back on your feet.

450
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,700
I know you too well.

451
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,980
The more you want to win, the more you'll get used to it.

452
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,660
But you forgot,

453
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,860
you'll see.

454
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:05,580
Jing Chuan.

455
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,340
You know what I want.

456
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:11,180
Yes.

457
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,540
You want them to be buried with the Mohist Army.

458
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,900
What are you doing?

459
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,500
It's been a long time,

460
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,500
and you're already so angry.

461
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,460
Do you want to live a peaceful life?

462
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,140
You killed Chen Siqi,

463
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,300
Mo Junyu.

464
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,700
Isn't that enough?

465
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:29,620
Is that enough?

466
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,780
There are more criminals

467
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,100
who are more powerful than them.

468
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,380
Jing Chuan.

469
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,220
The two countries are connected by the same fate.

470
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,180
You can't take the risk.

471
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,660
I'm not a man or a woman.

472
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,140
I'm not Chu or Xia.

473
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,220
Why should I understand?

474
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,260
I'm not getting married.

475
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,740
You're still thinking about

476
00:28:57,900 --> 00:29:00,020
the justice that boy said, right?

477
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,980
What I think

478
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:09,900
is not up to you to decide.

479
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,740
Jing Chuan.

480
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,060
Don't fight with me.

481
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,660
What can you do?

482
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,660
What can you do?

483
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,420
Not enough.

484
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,140
Far from enough.

485
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,540
I said

486
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,220
you lost your position and you should return the pearl.

487
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:47,620
Chen Siqi, Zhou Zheng,

488
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,900
Mo Junyu, Empress Dowager Cao.

489
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,980
And you,

490
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,140
Feng Shiyi.

491
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,740
Why don't you bow to me?

492
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,140
Even if it's just once.

493
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,820
Once.

494
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,300
Twice.

495
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,700
Twice.

496
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:24,460
Twice.

497
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:43,220
Don't you want to see me bow?

498
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,300
Why don't you dare to look at me?

499
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,580
I can do it if you're sure about it.

500
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,700
Master.

501
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,700
Feng Shiyi, lousy!

502
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:20,740
She didn't do it to ask for peace.

503
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:27,900
Wild

504
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,340
Wild

505
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:37,820
Wild

506
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:44,060
Wild

507
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,860
Wild

508
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,580
Wild

509
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,420
I'm sorry.

510
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,220
I'm sorry.

511
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:52,980
I'm sorry.

512
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,820
I'm sorry.

513
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,580
I'm sorry.

514
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,420
I'm sorry.

515
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,420
I'm sorry.

516
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,420
I'm sorry.

517
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,420
I'm sorry.

518
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,420
I'm sorry.

519
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,420
I'm sorry.

520
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,420
I'm sorry.

521
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,420
I'm sorry.

522
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,420
I'm sorry.

523
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,420
I'm sorry.

524
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,420
I'm sorry.

525
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:06,420
I'm sorry.

526
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,420
I'm sorry.

527
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,420
I'm sorry.

528
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,420
I'm sorry.

529
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,420
I'm sorry.

530
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,420
I'm sorry.

531
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:12,420
I'm sorry.

532
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:13,420
I'm sorry.

533
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,420
I'm sorry.

534
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,420
I'm sorry.

535
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,420
I'm sorry.

536
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,420
I'm sorry.

537
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,420
I'm sorry.

538
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,420
I'm sorry.

539
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,420
I'm sorry.

540
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,420
I'm sorry.

541
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,420
I'm sorry.

542
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:23,420
I'm sorry.

543
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,420
I'm sorry.

544
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:25,420
I'm sorry.

545
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,420
I'm sorry.

546
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:27,420
I'm sorry.

547
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,420
I'm sorry.

548
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,420
I'm sorry.

549
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,420
I'm sorry.

550
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,420
I'm sorry.

551
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,420
I'm sorry.

552
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,420
I'm sorry.

553
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,420
I'm sorry.

554
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,420
I'm sorry.

555
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,420
I'm sorry.

556
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,420
I'm sorry.

557
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,420
I'm sorry.

558
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,420
I'm sorry.

559
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,420
I'm sorry.

560
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,420
I'm sorry.

561
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,420
I'm sorry.

562
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,420
I'm sorry.

563
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,420
I'm sorry.

564
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,420
I'm sorry.

565
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,420
I'm sorry.

566
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:47,420
I'm sorry.

567
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,420
I'm sorry.

568
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,420
I'm sorry.
