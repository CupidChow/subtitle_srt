Am I right?

45
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,580
Minister Chen, you are Patriarch Cheng

46
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:55,780
I am demure

47
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,500
You dare to do such a thing?

48
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,780
I will never let you off even if I do it!

49
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,500
Isn't it good to live?

50
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,820
I heard that you two have been together since you were little.

51
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,420
Your sister is pregnant.

52
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,260
You are the first one to have a good life

53
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,980
that you can live in your dream.

54
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,540
It's easy to get Mo Qing Chuan out.

55
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,020
General Chen,

56
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,980
you should think about it

57
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:30,540
when you live together.

58
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,740
Lord Zhou.

59
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:47,020
Lord Zhou.

60
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,220
How is the case?

61
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:50,220
When can I get out?

62
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:53,980
He is a spy.

63
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:56,460
I can't say anything about Cao Ling An,

64
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,980
but he can write down his case.

65
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,300
It has nothing to do with me.

66
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,780
Cao Ling An is guilty.

67
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,020
What?

68
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,180
He left a letter.

69
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,980
He is the only one who knows about Duan Yan's case.

70
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,260
It has nothing to do with him.

71
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:16,700
Then why didn't you let me out?

72
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,540
I received a secret account.

73
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,260
It's about Lord Chen who wants to kill Mo Jun

74
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,420
and take him to the other people.

75
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,780
It's a huge thing.

76
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,660
It's enough to be a spy.

77
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,180
No.

78
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,060
It seems that Lord Chen can't go out for now.

79
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:36,420
No, Lord Zhou.

80
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,260
Someone must be trying to frame me.

81
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,780
You must do something for me, Lord Zhou.

82
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:42,180
I'm wronged.

83
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,220
Who is this person?

84
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:52,660
A secret account had a grant.

85
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,780
They let him see the letter.

86
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,980
Master...

87
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,860
I'm back.

88
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,660
Master.

89
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:10,760
I stole the account card from

90
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,120
Lord's Mansion atの停位す大门.

91
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,660
When he got off, he jumped right in.

92
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,660
I'll throw it to him like a light at midnight.

93
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,660
I'll see if his shadow is a needle or blood.

94
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,660
I don't know if it's a needle.

95
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,660
But this Zhou Zheng is a poor ghost.

96
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,660
One steamed bun, two salted dishes.

97
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,660
He even poked the door to the master.

98
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,660
It seems like he can't get any water out of it.

99
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,660
Such a big coffin.

100
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,660
There's only this little thing left at home.

101
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,660
He's free and calm.

102
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,660
He's a man of the past.

103
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,660
He doesn't take any of the famous names.

104
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,660
He even used the name of the phoenix and the name of the incense.

105
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,660
Even if he's a gold coffin, he wouldn't change his name.

106
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,660
He's a real man.

107
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,660
It's rare.

108
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,660
He even got a good coffin.

109
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:15,660
I also hope that he can bear this good word.

110
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,660
Yan'er, slow down.

111
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,660
Lord Zhou.

112
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:37,660
Madam, you go back first.

113
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,660
I have something to discuss with Lord Zhou.

114
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,660
Okay.

115
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,660
Lord Zhou.

116
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,660
The管 has already informed you.

117
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,660
The Taiwei House is going to be renovated.

118
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,660
It's a bit of a hassle.

119
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,660
Why don't you keep it a secret?

120
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,660
Thank you for your reminder.

121
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,660
But I have no plans to move out of this house.

122
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,660
Wait.

123
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,660
The Cao Ling'an has been in the prison for half a month.

124
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,660
I wonder why Lord Zhou is still in the prison?

125
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:25,660
Lord Mo is worried about Chen Siqi's situation.

126
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,660
Lord Zhou, where did you get this?

127
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,660
Lord Mo knows it very well.

128
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,660
I have nothing to do with him.

129
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,660
He's a good man.

130
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:46,660
I don't want to be a burden to him.

131
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,660
If he does anything wrong,

132
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:53,660
please punish him.

133
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,660
Lord Zhou is really a good man.

134
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,660
Thank you for your blessing.

135
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,660
You really have a lot of plans.

136
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,660
I think so too.

137
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,660
He doesn't care about the case of Chen Siqi.

138
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,660
He has some tricks in his hands.

139
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,660
He's the mastermind behind the lock-and-lock.

140
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,660
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:42,660
I'll go back to the prison.

142
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,660
You're welcome.

143
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,660
I'll go back to the prison.

144
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,660
I'll go back to the prison.

145
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,660
I'll go back to the prison.

146
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,660
Master, I've been to the capital.

147
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:04,660
I haven't found a good wine.

148
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,660
It's sour and sweet.

149
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,660
I knew it.

150
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,660
The wine of Qingchuan Town is so delicious.

151
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,660
The wine of the capital is so hard to drink.

152
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:22,660
The water is so clear that it's hard to drink.

153
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:25,660
The green plum is so sweet that it's hard to drink.

154
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,660
The spring breeze is so gentle and the fragrance is so sweet.

155
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:31,660
The flowers are so beautiful that I can't stop my eyes.

156
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:38,660
The whole of the most clean place in the whole of the city is the Beile River in Qingchuan Town.

157
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,660
Master, I want to go back to Qingchuan Town.

158
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:48,660
I can't go back. I have to wait a little longer.

159
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:51,660
The capital is so boring.

160
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:54,660
I don't know what my younger brother is doing.

161
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,660
When will he come to play with me?

162
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,660
I think...

163
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,660
he's happy.

164
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,660
Get ready.

165
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,660
Get ready.

166
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,660
Get ready.

167
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,660
Get ready.

168
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:24,660
Get ready.

169
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,660
Qiye is getting better.

170
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,660
It's time for the family to get married.

171
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,660
Is your son still young and not well?

172
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,660
Or is he still a mother?

173
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,660
You are the emperor of the country.

174
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,660
You should be the one to take the responsibility.

175
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,660
Your Majesty is wise.

176
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,660
Your Majesty has the teaching of the Empress Dowager.

177
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:58,660
He will become a wise emperor in the future.

178
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:02,660
He just has to do something with his power.

179
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,660
Empress Dowager, I have a memorial of General Cao Huai Tai.

180
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,660
What's wrong with him?

181
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:14,660
He asked the Empress Dowager to send the soldiers to the King of Jin's manor.

182
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:18,660
Qi Guang went to the army?

183
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:23,660
Yes. He said that the King of Jin's will is to let him surrender.

184
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:27,660
Thank you for your concern.

185
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:32,660
Qi Guang is so filial.

186
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,660
How can he do this?

187
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:37,660
He is willing to do anything for the people.

188
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:40,660
General Cao thinks that he has lost the Emperor's reputation.

189
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:44,660
He wants to get rid of the army immediately.

190
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,660
He just doesn't want to surrender.

191
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:51,660
He is worried that the King of Jin will be punished for his military duties.

192
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,660
I think we should just do as General Cao says.

193
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,660
Don't hurt the affection between Empress Dowager and General Cao.

194
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,660
Affection between?

195
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,660
He is so arrogant and arrogant.

196
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,660
He even went to the King of Jin's manor to surrender?

197
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,660
He is getting more and more ungrateful.

198
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,660
Empress Dowager, don't be angry.

199
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:16,660
General Cao is so filial.

200
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,660
He is not a bad person.

201
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,660
Since he is the King of Jin's manor,

202
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,660
I want to fulfill Qi Guang's wish.

203
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,660
Qi Ye, what do you think?

204
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:34,660
I have no objection. I will do everything according to my mother's decision.

205
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,660
Jun Yu, Qi Guang is also a royal bloodline.

206
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,660
You should arrange a document for him in the army.

207
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:52,660
Empress Dowager is wise. I will make arrangements.

208
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,660
King of Jin was attacked last night and was sent back from Chu.

209
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:05,660
It's a pity that he was severely injured by Chu on the way.

210
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,660
He was broken after the meeting with King of Jin.

211
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:13,660
King of Jin gave me the letter. He must have the news about the death of Jin.

212
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,660
Feng Shi Yan?

213
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,660
These information are complicated.

214
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:24,660
But the accounts of Cao Ling An are only the accounts of the people who were killed by the Mo Jun Yu.

215
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,660
But why did the Mo Jun Yu risk his life to kill King of Jin?

216
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,660
Little Junior Brother, have your meal.

217
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,660
Okay.

218
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660
Master.

219
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,660
You are back.

220
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,660
I have received the document of my life.

221
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,660
I can stay in the Black Armor Army in the future.

222
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:01,660
Who beat him?

223
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,660
I don't know.

224
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,660
I don't know.

225
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:04,660
I don't know.

226
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,660
I don't know.

227
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,660
I don't know.

228
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,660
I don't know.

229
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,660
I don't know.

230
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,660
I don't know.

231
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,660
I don't know.

232
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,660
I don't know.

233
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,660
I don't know.

234
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,660
Who beat him?

235
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,660
I don't know.

236
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,660
I don't know.

237
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,660
The military is so familiar with the Crown Prince.

238
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,660
Cao Huai Tan?

239
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,660
Why?

240
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,660
It's just a matter of time.

241
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,660
I don't want to hear it.

242
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:47,660
According to Cao Wei, the Seven-Sixth Art of Culture is a special item.

243
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,660
Yes.

244
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,660
After the seal is closed,

245
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,660
you don't have to stay in the army all day.

246
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,660
After the wedding,

247
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,660
I will come to ask you for your greetings.

248
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,660
You must be hungry.

249
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,660
Hurry up and eat.

250
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,660
Okay.

251
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,660
Master,

252
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,660
I have something to do tomorrow.

253
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,660
What's wrong?

254
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,660
Tomorrow, there will be a competition.

255
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:13,660
The merchants of Yijuan Army will also participate.

256
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,660
I think Chan Zihao is also in it.

257
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,660
I wonder if Master has received any invitations.

258
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:24,660
Master,

259
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:28,660
can you go with Qi Guang tomorrow?

260
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,660
The way of the army is about Qi Guang.

261
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,660
It's the most important step in the world.

262
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:41,660
I want to ask you to meet him.

263
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,660
I'm afraid I can't go with you tomorrow.

264
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,660
Okay, I understand.

265
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,660
It's okay.

266
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,660
Master,

267
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,660
I have something to do.

268
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,660
Master,

269
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,660
a few days ago,

270
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,660
I met a few people in the army.

271
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,660
They refused to leave the Cao family.

272
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,660
They were very excited.

273
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,660
It was the old steps of the Mo family.

274
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,660
Mother once said,

275
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:24,660
the weather is cold in the west,

276
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,660
the wind is also strong.

277
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,660
But now,

278
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,660
the Cao family is all in the clouds.

279
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,660
I have to suffer for a day.

280
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,660
I officially leave the army tomorrow.

281
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,660
Although I'm not good enough,

282
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,660
I'm not willing to leave.

283
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:48,660
Jiang Kui,

284
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,660
you can handle the matter of Chan Zihao tomorrow.

285
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,660
After all,

286
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:57,660
tomorrow is an important day for Qi Guang.

287
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,660
Master.

288
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,660
I'll go with you tomorrow.

289
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,660
Okay.

290
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:03,660
Thank you, master.

291
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:06,660
No, I want to go too.

292
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,660
I'm happy with you.

293
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,660
Let's go crazy together.

294
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,660
Congratulations, your highness.

295
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,660
You have a seventh rank in the army.

296
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:18,660
I'll get a new uniform.

297
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,660
I'll get a new uniform.

298
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,660
Change it.

299
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:39,660
Don't lose.

300
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,660
Master, you've finished the matter.

301
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,660
Master.

302
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,660
Who else wants to challenge?

303
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,660
Master.

304
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,660
His name is Shi Tou.

305
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,660
He's the vice general of the Cao Huai Taixi.

306
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:54,660
He's a martial artist.

307
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:55,660
Good martial arts.

308
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:00,660
It seems that

309
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,660
this year's competition,

310
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:05,660
Shi Tou is the first.

311
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,660
Master.

312
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,660
Master.

313
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,660
Master.

314
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,660
Master.

315
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:10,660
Master.

316
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,660
Shi Tou.

317
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,660
He's from the north.

318
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:19,660
He's a good fighter.

319
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,660
He's a good fighter.

320
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,660
I heard that

321
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:25,660
he only wants to join the Black Armor Army.

322
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,660
His highness likes it.

323
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:30,660
He's been promoted to a secret service.

324
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,660
What's that?

325
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:35,660
He's never killed a person.

326
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,660
But now,

327
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:37,660
we're brothers.

328
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,660
The reward and punishment are all decided by him.

329
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,660
I, Shi Tou, am the first.

330
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,660
You're so kind.

331
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,660
Today's competition,

332
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,660
I, Shi Tou,

333
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,660
want to send out the wind-breaker.

334
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,660
Do you dare to challenge?

335
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,660
Wind-breaker?

336
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,660
This is the tradition of the Xia Army.

337
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,660
Wind-breaker is a fight between life and death.

338
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,660
If you don't challenge,

339
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,660
others will think that

340
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,660
you're afraid of death

341
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,660
after you go to battle.

342
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,660
This is the Yang-Meng.

343
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,660
Qi Guang,

344
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,660
this battle is inevitable.

345
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,660
Yes, master.

346
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:24,660
Good.

347
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,660
You're not a coward.

348
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,660
It's hard to teach the emperor.

349
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,660
The battle in the army is fierce.

350
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,660
Life and death are not the same.

351
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:34,660
Life and death are not the same.

352
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,660
Life and death are not the same.

353
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,660
I'm so jealous.

354
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,660
I'm so jealous.

355
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,660
Is my brother fighting or not?

356
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,660
I'm twenty years old.

357
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,660
Good.

358
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,660
Master,

359
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:14,660
I'm twenty years old.

360
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:15,660
You're a master of martial arts.

361
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,660
You're a master of martial arts.

362
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,660
You're a master of martial arts.

363
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,660
You're a master of martial arts.

364
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,660
Shi Tou,

365
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,660
you're so lucky.

366
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,660
I'm sorry, master.

367
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,660
In the future,

368
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,660
I'll take care of you.

369
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:31,660
General Cao,

370
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,660
this Qi Guang is used

371
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,660
as a way to fight against the Mo family.

372
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,660
It's been almost twenty years.

373
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,660
General Mo Jun Shan has returned to the capital.

374
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,660
He has been trained in the army.

375
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,660
I've seen this knife before.

376
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,660
It's said that the Mo family's knife is very hard to practice.

377
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,660
It needs a very high talent.

378
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,660
So,

379
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:52,660
only a few enemies are qualified to learn it.

380
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,660
It's not passed on to the army.

381
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,660
There's only this thing.

382
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,660
But

383
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,660
the Mo family is dying.

384
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,660
He's dead.

385
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,660
He's not here

386
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,660
to fight against Qi Guang and Mo Tai Wei.

387
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,660
Where did he learn it?

388
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:11,660
He's not

389
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:15,660
the Mo Qing Chuan from Chu.

390
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,660
Then we should ask this Prince.

391
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,660
Who wants to challenge?

392
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,660
Since no one challenges,

393
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,660
I'll go.

394
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,660
I have a question.

395
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,660
I've never seen you.

396
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,660
You're so good at martial arts.

397
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:41,660
You really impressed me.

398
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,660
I'm very curious about something.

399
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,660
Where did you learn

400
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,660
the Mo family's knife?

401
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,660
What?

402
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,660
The Mo family's knife is very powerful.

403
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,660
It's the most powerful knife in the world.

404
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,660
Today,

405
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,660
I've finally seen it.

406
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,660
Prince,

407
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,660
the secret guards

408
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,660
are now answering me.

409
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,660
Where did you learn

410
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,660
the Mo family's knife?

411
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:26,660
What do you mean?

412
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,660
The Mo family's knife is powerful.

413
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,660
The Mo family's knife

414
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,660
is the only one

415
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:37,660
that can defeat Mo Tai Wei.

416
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,660
Is it the Mo Qing Chuan

417
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,660
who taught Prince's skills?

418
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,660
No.

419
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,660
Who's the master?

420
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,660
It's me.

421
00:21:58,660 --> 00:21:59,660
Who's that?

422
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,660
I think it's the master of the Martial Arts Competition.

423
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:08,660
Let me correct it.

424
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,660
The Mo family's knife

425
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,660
is not only the enemy's skill.

426
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,660
It's also a request to the Heavenly Father.

427
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,660
Ordinary people can't learn it.

428
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,660
I saw Xia Qi Guang

429
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,660
being so talented.

430
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,660
I was so talented.

431
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,660
I taught him.

432
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,660
If General Cao has talent,

433
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:26,660
I can teach him, too.

434
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:29,660
Or any other enemy in the field.

435
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,660
After all, the Mo family's knife

436
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,660
is meant to protect the country.

437
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,660
But

438
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,660
I think General Cao is just ordinary.

439
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,660
I think he's talented.

440
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,660
What are you?

441
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:49,660
I'm not talented.

442
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:50,660
I'm the first knight in the world,

443
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,660
the first master of the East and the South.

444
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:53,660
I'm a good man.

445
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,660
Don't forget me.

446
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,660
So you're the Mo family.

447
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,660
Where did the Mo family

448
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,660
come from?

449
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,660
It's a long-standing past.

450
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,660
Long time ago,

451
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:15,660
I had a meeting with General Mo Jun Shan.

452
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,660
I was so close to him.

453
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:21,660
He gave me a knife.

454
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,660
He told me

455
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,660
the Mo family's knife is hard to understand.

456
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:27,660
It's hard to pass through.

457
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:29,660
Such a good knife.

458
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,660
Why have I never heard of it before?

459
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,660
I've never heard of it before.

460
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,660
I heard that the passing of the river is long.

461
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,660
I can't see it.

462
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,660
So I gave you a knife.

463
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,660
He told me to meet someone with talent.

464
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,660
So I gave you a knife.

465
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,660
Why did you lie to me?

466
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:47,660
It's so missful.

467
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,660
There's not so much coincidence in the world.

468
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,660
Now I suspect that

469
00:23:57,660 --> 00:24:00,660
you are the Mo Qing Chuan,

470
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,660
the traitor of Pang State.

471
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,660
I think the Mo family's Mo

472
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,660
is Mo Qing Chuan's Mo.

473
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,660
Otherwise, why don't you

474
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,660
really face the Mo family?

475
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,660
I'm afraid so.

476
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,660
Is it really Mo Qing Chuan?

477
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,660
Yes.

478
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,660
Give me the old cloth

479
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:21,660
of the Mo Qing Chuan.

480
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,660
Yes.

481
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,660
Mo Qing Chuan really is Mo Qing Chuan.

482
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,660
I'm afraid the traitor will come back.

483
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,660
I'll be the chief of the family.

484
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,660
I'll kill him.

485
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,660
I'll kill him.

486
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,660
Yes.

487
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,660
General Cao.

488
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,660
Today,

489
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,660
once the traitor Mo Qing Chuan

490
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:52,660
entered the Black Armor Army,

491
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,660
you all have to watch carefully.

492
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,660
If you attack me,

493
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:59,660
I'll be rewarded.

494
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,660
Cao Huaitan.

495
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:08,660
I'm also a man with a face.

496
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:10,660
I was misjudged today.

497
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,660
And I'm still the traitor of Mo Qing Chuan.

498
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,660
It's really a serious wound.

499
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,660
If I'm not Mo Qing Chuan,

500
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,660
what about General Cao?

501
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:22,660
If not,

502
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,660
I'll be the one to

503
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,660
apologize to the Mo family.

504
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,660
You said it.

505
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,660
Then you all

506
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:37,660
watch carefully.

507
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,660
It's here.

508
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:54,660
What's it?

509
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,660
It's Mo Qing Chuan.

510
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,660
Look carefully.

511
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,660
Look carefully?

512
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:04,660
Is he Mo Qing Chuan?

513
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,660
General Huibing.

514
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,660
He's not Mo Qing Chuan.

515
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,660
How could you come to the place where you're from?

516
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,660
This fat girl

517
00:26:14,660 --> 00:26:16,660
can't even compare to the finger of General Qing Chuan.

518
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,660
Exactly.

519
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,660
She's not as tall as General Qing Chuan.

520
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,660
And she's not as strong as General Qing Chuan.

521
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,660
Really?

522
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,660
Really?

523
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,660
What do you think I'm doing?

524
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,660
I heard Mo Qing Chuan is the most mischievous.

525
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:49,660
He's not as mischievous as you.

526
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:50,660
What a shame.

527
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,660
You may leave.

528
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,660
Yes.

529
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,660
If General has anything to say,

530
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:26,660
I'll listen to you.

531
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,660
Yes.

532
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,660
Yes.

533
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,660
Yes.

534
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,660
Get out of here.

535
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,660
Since I'm not Mo Qing Chuan,

536
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:53,660
how am I going to pay for my face?

537
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:58,660
What do you think of

538
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,660
the Mo family?

539
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:10,660
This is a compensation.

540
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,660
You dare to kill me?

541
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,660
Take it!

542
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,660
I'll leave the ghost here.

543
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,660
I'll see who dares to move.

544
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,660
If you admit your mistake,

545
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,660
you'll have to admit your mistake.

546
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:23,660
The animal

547
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,660
might as well think about

548
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,660
whether it will break the Empress Dowager's way.

549
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,660
General,

550
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,660
we're leaving now.

551
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,660
Forget it.

552
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,660
What if it turns into a good girl?

553
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,660
It won't be good either.

554
00:28:35,660 --> 00:28:37,660
Are you the one who's in the wrong?

555
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:38,660
Or are you the one who's in the wrong?

556
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:39,660
I'm the one who's in the wrong.

557
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,660
I'm the one who's in the wrong.

558
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,660
Get out of here.

559
