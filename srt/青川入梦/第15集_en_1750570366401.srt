1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Mo Qingchuan.

2
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,960
Mo Qingchuan.

3
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,080
At that moment,

4
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,680
what were you thinking?

5
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,040
You didn't appear in my dream.

6
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,880
Do you think I would feel guilty?

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,800
Ha ha ha ha.

8
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,080
Huang Jinchuan,

9
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,680
Liuliwa,

10
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,560
Phoenix,

11
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,520
and Qiwu Palace.

12
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,760
I won't be like you.

13
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,080
I won't be the second Qingchuan

14
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,000
in the capital.

15
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,160
I'm afraid that I can't be a man.

16
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,600
I'm afraid that I can't be a woman.

17
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,760
That's all nonsense.

18
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,840
You should go

19
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,480
by yourself.

20
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:32,200
I won't work with you.

21
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,680
Kill him.

22
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,160
Your Majesty,

23
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,280
did you have a nightmare?

24
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,000
Slow down, Suqi.

25
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,720
Chao Qingchuan,

26
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,880
Mo Qingchuan,

27
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,400
Mo Qingchuan,

28
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,680
I will follow the decree and marry.

29
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,560
By the edict of the emperor,

30
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,520
Mo Qingchuan will be the princess of Huayao.

31
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,440
She will be the princess of Chu, Feng Shiyue.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,280
She is a big girl.

33
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,800
I hope you can do your duty

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,200
and promote the friendship between the two countries.

35
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,000
That's all.

36
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,600
General Qingchuan,

37
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,280
please take the edict.

38
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,040
Given the signal,

39
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,600
move the court to the south and set out.

40
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:11,540
Liushan,

41
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,480
In the moon vision back in the demonstration area,

42
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,400
it's possible,

43
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,240
Princess of Liang appeared.

44
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:27,360
The newlyweds will share their parents' desire for love.

45
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,360
Master, how is she?

46
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
Are you here to congratulate me?

47
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,160
No.

48
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,160
That's to comfort me, your subordinate.

49
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
Master, I...

50
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,360
Don't you always want to know

51
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,160
the relationship between Feng Zong and me?

52
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
You always want to know

53
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:59,160
the engagement between Feng Shiye and me.

54
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,760
He promised me to kill all my enemies.

55
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,760
So I married him.

56
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:06,760
But now,

57
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,360
he and my enemies are working together.

58
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,360
He used me as a pawn to play tricks.

59
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,760
Then I'll

60
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,160
make up for his game.

61
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,160
Master,

62
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,960
what do you want to do?

63
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,360
I, Mo Qingchuan,

64
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,560
led thousands of troops

65
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,560
to conquer the enemy's camp.

66
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,560
I also fought alone.

67
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,760
I only took the enemy's main weapon.

68
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,560
But now,

69
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,960
even if it's just a piece of silk,

70
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,560
the people I want to kill

71
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,560
can't stop me

72
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,960
even if they're millions of people.

73
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,760
Master,

74
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,760
Doctor Fang Du said

75
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,960
you can't use your internal force anymore.

76
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,760
You've already done it.

77
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,960
I can't let you

78
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,160
go anywhere.

79
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,560
Shu Qi Guang,

80
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,160
you can't let Master leave here.

81
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,160
You're going to stop me?

82
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
Yes.

83
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,560
The Empress Dowager is guilty.

84
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,160
But she holds the power of the heavenly peace.

85
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,560
If she's shaken,

86
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:18,960
the internal chaos

87
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,960
will destroy the whole Xia.

88
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,360
By then,

89
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,560
the whole Xia will be destroyed.

90
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
Move aside!

91
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,760
Master,

92
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,560
please wait a little longer.

93
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,360
I've waited for long enough.

94
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,560
I'm relieved enough.

95
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,760
I've never

96
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,960
waited for justice.

97
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,760
Mo Jun Yu!

98
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
In this way,

99
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
Master's name

100
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,360
will be included

101
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,920
in the list of

102
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,320
Swordsman's affirmation.

103
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,240
If it was

104
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,920
my intention,

105
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,240
then

106
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:04,160
we had Public Target

107
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,520
come here first,

108
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,120
then

109
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,120
papa Li

110
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,120
and

111
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,360
Chiefギ

112
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,320
you think

113
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,160
the civil court

114
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,240
can be

115
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,240
moreelly

116
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,400
stroke the king

117
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,120
of the Maientian clan.

118
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,840
I hope

119
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,040
I must cross them.

120
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,000
And...

121
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,800
my body.

122
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:40,920
Master!

123
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,080
You've really grown up.

124
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:46,240
Prince Jin.

125
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,200
There are thousands of young men outras.

126
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,320
The man I saved was born to be the secondーン solarLuan.

127
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,600
The people of the country

128
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,920
are even more important than the people.

129
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,400
I can't let you

130
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,560
die with me.

131
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,240
Prince Jin,

132
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:25,960
come on.

133
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,000
Use your tricks

134
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,240
to kill me.

135
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,960
Take my phone

136
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,920
and go to the Empress Dowager

137
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,160
and report to the imperial doctor

138
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,840
that the traitor Mo Qingchuan is dead.

139
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,240
Hey,

140
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,480
are you

141
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,200
beginning

142
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,080
to take the blame for the Empress Dowager?

143
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:53,360
No.

144
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,480
I'll just

145
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,640
arrest Master Wu Ni

146
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,560
and punish him.

147
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,240
Alright.

148
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,280
No.

149
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,280
You think I'm soft-hearted?

150
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,640
I will have a soft dream.

151
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,760
Master.

152
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,160
I have ordered

153
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,920
if this door is opened,

154
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
no matter who comes,

155
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,000
I will shoot

156
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,880
and kill them.

157
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,160
Good.

158
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,000
It's a good place

159
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,000
to die in the hands of the Mo Troop.

160
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
The Mo Troop

161
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,280
is a place

162
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,280
where the Mo Troop

163
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:45,280
is a place

164
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:46,280
where the Mo Troop

165
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
is a place

166
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,280
where the Mo Troop

167
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,280
is a place

168
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,280
where the Mo Troop

169
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,280
is a place

170
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,280
where the Mo Troop

171
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,280
is a place

172
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,280
where the Mo Troop

173
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,280
is a place

174
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,280
where the Mo Troop

175
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
is a place

176
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,280
where the Mo Troop

177
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,280
is a place

178
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,280
where the Mo Troop

179
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,280
is a place

180
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,280
where the Mo Troop

181
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,280
is a place

182
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
where the Mo Troop

183
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
is a place

184
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,280
where the Mo Troop

185
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,280
is a place

186
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,280
where the Mo Troop

187
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,280
is a place

188
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,280
where the Mo Troop

189
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,280
is a place

190
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,740
The Mo Troop liberation camp has broken the battle

191
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,280
ask Mo General to check

192
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,680
General Mo's battle suit.

193
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,120
He asked me to ask General Mo

194
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,840
if he remembered Huo Fu Bin and Cui.

195
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,560
I remembered Cui.

196
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,640
Cui is here.

197
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,880
Xiao Zhuang is here.

198
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,520
Xiao Li is here.

199
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,240
Xiao Zhuang is here.

200
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,000
Xiao Wang is here.

201
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,720
Xiao Zhuang is here.

202
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,440
Xiao Li is here.

203
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,520
Xiao Ying is here.

204
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,120
Xiao Li is here.

205
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:54,960
I'm Xiao Su.

206
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,960
General Qingchuan.

207
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:10,960
Master.

208
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:22,720
You have

209
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:43,040
Prince Jin, is it true that Empress Dowager

210
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,040
wants to marry General to Chu?

211
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:54,960
What nonsense!

212
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,600
It's better to not talk about it.

213
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,960
It's better...

214
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,960
It's better to not talk about it.

215
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,640
Old man Si, you're blind too?

216
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,680
Sir, please forgive me.

217
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,000
You lost your tongue.

218
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,800
Yes, yes.

219
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,480
You should be asking for mercy.

220
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,880
You're a scoundrel.

221
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,880
You...

222
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,680
You...

223
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,880
You're a scoundrel!

224
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
You...

225
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,880
Someone's been killed!

226
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,680
Someone's been killed!

227
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,680
Someone's been killed!

228
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,680
You scared me to death!

229
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,480
Scared to death...

230
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,280
Shi Tou! Shi Tou!

231
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,200
You're so useless.

232
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,080
Step aside.

233
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,880
Don't hit me.

234
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,160
Stop.

235
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,120
What's going on?

236
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,280
The murderer is here.

237
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,520
The court is so crowded.

238
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,520
The murderer is here.

239
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,720
How dare you!

240
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,520
He...

241
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,160
He seems to be a Chinese.

242
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,920
What's wrong with him?

243
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,360
Can't you catch him

244
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,480
if he's on the land of Xia?

245
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,320
If not,

246
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,640
I dare to soar down to the earth now.

247
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,720
Sit down.

248
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,400
Master.

249
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,600
Don't worry.

250
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,840
We're petty people.

251
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,320
I won't break the promise.

252
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:23,600
Wait.

253
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:25,880
I understand.

254
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,480
Minister He,

255
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,880
you came so early today.

256
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,280
I'm sorry.

257
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
I'm sorry.

258
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,880
I'm sorry.

259
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,080
I'm sorry.

260
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
I'm sorry.

261
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:52,480
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,680
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,680
You came so early today.

264
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,480
It's not time to open the gate.

265
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,080
Then I'll wait here.

266
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,480
You seem to have good news.

267
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,880
It's the good news of the country.

268
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,680
The Imperial Court

269
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:43,280
Minister He.

270
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,480
Your Majesty, it's me.

271
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
At this time,

272
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,080
shouldn't you go to the Imperial Court with Mother?

273
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,680
Since the ancestors came to the country,

274
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,280
there are the customs of the court officials and officials.

275
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,680
But the Empress Dowager took the throne.

276
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,680
She refused to see the emperor.

277
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:01,680
Minister He.

278
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,280
The Empress Dowager wanted to imitate Yinfu,

279
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,680
and fight against the four ministers,

280
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,880
and cause chaos in the court.

281
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,480
Now the emperor is in the same boat.

282
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,280
Why should he be alone?

283
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
Minister He, you're so strict.

284
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:15,080
I and all loyal ministers,

285
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,480
are willing to fight against the emperor

286
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,480
and go to the lower realm together.

287
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,480
Who is the lower realm?

288
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,880
I'm here, Minister He.

289
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:47,080
You know your mistake, Minister He.

290
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,880
He Zhixiang provokes Li Jian,

291
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,480
and has a clear conscience.

292
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,880
If he is not given 80 grand,

293
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,880
you will teach him a good lesson.

294
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,000
so the war cogails?

295
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,520
Prime Minister, you seem to have considerations.

296
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,820
Please make me your ledger.

297
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,360
I heard that

298
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,600
a military deaths last night

299
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,240
were litt tiddled by Chu,

300
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,320
which made people angry.

301
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,000
This joke

302
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,400
has 동ed with the people's morale.

303
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,440
Prime Minister Yihong,

304
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,440
If the two countries start a war,

305
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,680
are you ready to die to train the country?

306
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,520
Stop!

307
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,240
Lord He!

308
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,720
Lord He!

309
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,040
Lord He!

310
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,160
I'm afraid I know.

311
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,760
I know people's halls and palaces,

312
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,560
but the world is and temos,

313
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,200
I never seem to impacto the past.

314
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,680
I'll rather be Lind funded

315
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:43,160
than be made toeuep.

316
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:57,360
Take the

317
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,360
Premier away

318
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:11,080
He and signaturesок

319
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,960
You

320
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,920
You

321
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,960
He Zhixiang defied the court

322
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,360
and died without a trace.

323
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,160
Are you going to follow him?

324
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,720
Sign the treaty immediately

325
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,720
and agree to all the treaty conditions of Chu.

326
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,200
No more agreement.

327
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,680
No need to sign it again.

328
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,840
As for the end of the writing process,

329
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:35,760
다는iar

330
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:44,880
Put the읏

331
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:47,880
Wait.

332
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
What?

333
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,320
Prince Jing, you have a reason.

334
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,320
I...

335
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,320
don't remember.

336
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Prince Jing, have you really made up your mind?

337
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,320
There is no way out.

338
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,320
Yes.

339
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
What do you mean by this?

340
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
Please agree to a request.

341
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:52,320
Please...

342
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
take over the throne.

343
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,320
Take over the throne?

344
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,320
Official He's body is still cold.

345
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
Prince Jing, don't worry about the future.

346
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,320
I'm not afraid.

347
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,320
The Empress Dowager's birthday banquet is a good opportunity.

348
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,320
The Huting Army under Cao Huai Tai

349
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,320
is not my opponent.

350
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
But...

351
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,320
if it fails...

352
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:19,320
If it fails, I'll take the responsibility.

353
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,320
His Majesty

354
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,320
doesn't know from the beginning to the end.

355
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,320
I understand.

356
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,320
Your Majesty, don't worry.

357
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:28,320
Laughter is the foundation of a person.

358
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,320
I will only disobey the Empress Dowager.

359
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,320
I won't hurt her.

360
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
Jinchanchou,

361
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
I greet you, Young General Qingchuan.

362
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,320
Report, Young General.

363
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,320
The army of Chu has been investigated.

364
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,320
The agreement has been made.

365
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
I will take the throne.

366
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,320
I will take the throne.

367
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,320
I will take the throne.

368
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,320
I will take the throne.

369
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
The agreement has been made.

370
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
Qingchuan,

371
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,320
it's time to go back to Chu with me.

372
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,320
Thanks to you,

373
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,320
I can see

374
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,320
what I mean to the Xia State.

375
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
Do you want the Empress Dowager's life?

376
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,320
Of course.

377
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
The Empress Dowager is useless to me.

378
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,320
If you want her life,

379
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,320
I'll help you.

380
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
But...

381
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
if you take that step,

382
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
you can never go back.

383
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
What else is worth my time?

384
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,320
Don't worry.

385
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,320
I can do everything.

386
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,320
Really?

387
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,320
What is this?

388
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,320
The hidden weapons I have with the Empress Dowager

389
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,320
will be used against you.

390
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,320
Who is it?

391
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
Suji.

392
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,320
Thank you.

393
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,320
I'm sorry.

394
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,320
I'm sorry.

395
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:43,320
I'm sorry.

396
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
I'm sorry.

397
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,320
When everything is settled,

398
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,320
we will go back to Qingchuan together.

399
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
I know you don't want to forget

400
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
because you don't want to forget our agreement.

401
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,320
I've never forgotten.

402
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,320
I'm sorry.

403
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
Why isn't Master back yet?

404
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,320
Shi...

405
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,320
The King of Jin's Night

406
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,320
appeared in my fiancee's house.

407
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:48,320
I'm afraid it's not appropriate.

408
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
I came to tell you

409
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
that I've found a way

410
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,320
to make you marry him.

411
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,320
No need, Qi Guang.

412
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,320
Master,

413
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,320
I'm sorry.

414
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:05,320
I'm sorry.

415
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
I'm sorry.

416
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,320
I'm sorry.

417
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
I'm sorry.

418
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,320
I'm sorry.

419
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,320
Master.

420
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:16,320
I'm tired.

421
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,320
I can't satisfy your expectations

422
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,320
and return to Mo Qingchuan.

423
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,320
Leaving here

424
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,320
is a relief to me,

425
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
isn't it?

426
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:26,320
Master, I...

427
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,320
You can go.

428
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
Why did you keep him by your side?

429
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,320
I just want to see Mo Qingchuan

430
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,320
through those eyes

431
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,320
and see the past.

432
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,320
That's all?

433
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,320
What else?

434
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,320
Okay.

435
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,320
I believe

436
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,320
everything you said.

437
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,320
The world and the world

438
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,500
are like the moon and the

439
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,320
moon are like the waves.

440
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
Tonight,

441
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
I'm in tears

442
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
as I'm in love with you.

443
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
The moon is like the sky.

444
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
That year,

445
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,320
the moon turned around

446
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,320
and returned to the same place.

447
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
It's a delusion.

448
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,320
The cold winter night

449
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
is the hometown

450
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,320
that I can't go back to.

451
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,320
I can't forget

452
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,320
the time we spent together.

453
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,320
It's like a dream.

454
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
The wind and fire

455
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
are young.

456
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,320
The horse and the song are young.

457
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
The song of parting

458
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,320
is heard in the morning.

459
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,320
The love is small.

460
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
The love is long.

461
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,320
The words are

462
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,320
like the light in the world.

463
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
The sky is bright.

464
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:08,320
The sea is

465
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,320
like the flowers.
