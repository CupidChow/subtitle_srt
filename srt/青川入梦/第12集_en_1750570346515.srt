1
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,880
The line of war

2
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,080
Your Majesty

3
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,120
Mo Qingchuan turned against the rebellion

4
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:20,960
It's all because of Qingchuan's fail

5
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,120
He is never repent

6
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:26,280
Your Majesty

7
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,840
I said

8
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,800
exactly what I wanted

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,760
General Mo, it doesn't matter whether I believe it or not.

10
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:39,600
What matters is that you must believe it.

11
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:48,600
Do you know why you and Mo Qingchuan chose you?

12
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:53,200
I'm loyal to the Empress Dowager.

13
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,000
I heard that the river in Qingchuan Town has been very clear since I was young.

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,800
It's like the sky is empty.

15
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,800
Really?

16
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,000
Replying to the Empress Dowager, it's indeed like that.

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,600
You are just like that. Everyone is just like that.

18
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
I don't believe it.

19
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,400
When I first saw Mo Qingchuan,

20
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,200
I asked him the same question.

21
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,800
He didn't answer me yet. I believed it.

22
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:29,400
Looking at his eyes, I immediately forgot about the river in Qingchuan.

23
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,600
At that moment, I understood

24
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,000
that he can't stay anymore.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The river in Qingchuan can't stay in the capital.

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,200
You should be lucky. You, Mo Junyu,

27
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,600
are the most despicable person in the Mo family.

28
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,000
General Mo Qingchuan has been working hard these years.

29
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:03,200
He has a lot of merits. He should be treated fairly.

30
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,800
Mo Qingchuan, thank you, Empress Dowager.

31
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,800
You can tell me what kind of justice you want.

32
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,400
I want Mo Junyu

33
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
to be killed.

34
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
What else?

35
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,000
Reconstruct the Mo family's military banner.

36
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,400
What else?

37
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,800
Nothing.

38
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,200
Just like that?

39
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,600
That's enough.

40
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,800
No more permission.

41
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,000
Mo Junyu's life is yours.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

43
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,600
I believe in you.

44
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,400
Protect Miss Mo from the old domain,

45
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,960
and put Maybe Siqi to sleep.

46
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,160
and is trapped in private affairs.

47
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,440
Mo Jun and Chen Ni are in power.

48
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,320
General Mo Qingchuan is in deep trouble.

49
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,920
Fortunately, the minister is gone.

50
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,560
The sword is back.

51
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,400
Your Highness.

52
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,880
Greetings, General Qingchuan.

53
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,400
Minglayin Temple

54
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,680
Master.

55
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,320
Back then,

56
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,760
I told you to make two relics

57
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:23,340
before

58
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,120
You're going to be punished by Recall that I met you in the outer slide?

59
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,180
次

60
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,760
highlighted

61
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,000
Who does not do it

62
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,960
Who's behind this

63
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,800
I'm really blind.

64
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Who is he?

65
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,800
The one who left the door,

66
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
buried the body,

67
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
and killed the person,

68
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
and the one who knew the truth is dead.

69
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
The one who can cover the sky and the sun,

70
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
who is he?

71
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,800
Aren't you very clear?

72
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
He asked you to kill the old Prince Jing.

73
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,800
No, I want to kill him.

74
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Why?

75
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Someone sent me a secret letter

76
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,800
saying that the old Prince Jing

77
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
found out the whereabouts of Qinglian.

78
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Xuan Lu,

79
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
it turns out that

80
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
it's him.

81
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
You don't even know who sent you the secret letter.

82
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
What if someone used you

83
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,800
to kill someone with a knife?

84
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
I can't avoid it.

85
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
I'd rather kill someone by mistake.

86
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
I gave you

87
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
the answer you wanted.

88
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,800
Give me a good one.

89
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Come on.

90
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Mo Junyu,

91
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:20,800
Bodhisattva,

92
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
if you really regret

93
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
killing you today,

94
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,800
I won't kill you.

95
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
Really?

96
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
Three, two...

97
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
I regret it.

98
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
Mo Junyu betrayed the country

99
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
and framed Mo Qingchuan,

100
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,260
and sent thousands of

101
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,800
first-class soldiers to the capital.

102
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
What else?

103
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
What else?

104
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
Nothing.

105
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
My eyes!

106
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,800
And,

107
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,800
you killed my father,

108
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
your brother, Mo Junshan.

109
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,800
My father loved you and loved you

110
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,800
and always followed your heart.

111
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,800
You know that he taught you well.

112
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
But he never thought that

113
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,800
his own brother would kill him

114
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
and send him to the imperial court.

115
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
Mo Qingchuan,

116
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,800
you said you'd let me go.

117
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,800
If you want me,

118
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,800
then run away.

119
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
Mo Qingchuan,

120
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
you have no mercy.

121
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
It's me.

122
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:18,800
Xiao Qi Guang.

123
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,800
Yu Pei.

124
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
Yu Pei.

125
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
My Yu Pei.

126
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,800
My Yu Pei.

127
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
My Yu Pei.

128
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,800
My Yu Pei.

129
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,800
My Yu Pei.

130
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,800
My Yu Pei.

131
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
My Yu Pei.

132
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
My Yu Pei.

133
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:42,800
My Yu Pei.

134
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,800
You don't deserve

135
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
such a white Yu Pei.

136
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,800
I don't deserve it.

137
00:09:58,800 --> 00:09:59,800
Mo Qingchuan,

138
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,800
listen to me.

139
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,800
I won't go back.

140
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
I, Mo Junyu,

141
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,800
have been loyal to the Mohist School.

142
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,800
But why did everyone

143
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,800
see you

144
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,800
as a arrogant little girl?

145
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
You've never seen

146
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,800
me stand by Liya.

147
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,800
Everyone looked at me.

148
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
For the hero of that day,

149
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,800
I could kill your father a thousand times

150
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,800
and ten thousand times.

151
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,800
Shut up.

152
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,800
If I don't kill you,

153
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
someone will kill you.

154
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Killing you

155
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
will only dirty his hands.

156
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,800
You don't need to go back.

157
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
What's the use of going back?

158
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
It's hard to live.

159
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,800
You'll die if you go back.

160
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Don't be sad.

161
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
Don't forget it.

162
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,800
Uncle.

163
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,800
Master.

164
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,800
It's okay.

165
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,800
Master.

166
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
He's dead.

167
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
From now on,

168
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,800
he's no longer your King of Evil.

169
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,800
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,800
I'm sorry.

171
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,800
I'm sorry.

172
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,800
I'm sorry.

173
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,800
I'm sorry.

174
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,800
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,800
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Don't wait for me.

178
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
Who would ever...

179
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,520
take a brief love position from anyone else

180
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,520
when they meet each other!

181
00:12:44,520 --> 00:13:01,080
Qingchuan lies to the Queen in execution

182
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,700
The Queen Notice

183
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,300
ke Qingchuan as her invalid

184
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,780
Qingchuan's corpse won't be saved

185
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,900
It's very dangerous

186
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,420
and not saved,

187
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,720
therefore resumed his position in Wu An duke

188
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,080
and served His Majesty at Zhaнов.

189
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:22,400
Thank you for your generosity,

190
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,160
Mo Qing Chuan.

191
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,680
No regrets,

192
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,460
I hereby impudently store my order.

193
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,760
Mo QingChuan?

194
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,500
He said Mo QingChuan won't fall into the manipulator trap?

195
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,880
Never thought that he is this kind of bastard.

196
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,040
You should call him Peeniff郎.

197
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,300
The Mo's army is re-arming. How can we go to surrender?

198
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,420
By the will of the Emperor

199
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,700
Cao Huai Tai is loyal and benevolent

200
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,740
He is promoted to the Grand Commandant

201
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,860
He will continue to manage the military power of the Black Armor Army

202
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,900
He is willing to show his red map

203
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,140
to defend the country and the country

204
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,300
By the will of the Emperor

205
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,820
Xia Qigong is smart and benevolent

206
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,420
He is promoted to the Prince of Jing

207
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,540
He will inherit the late ancestors' business

208
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:15,580
and go to the holy world together

209
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,180
That's all

210
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:23,580
Zhou Zheng

211
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:26,500
He faked the road and accused the meritorious officials

212
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,060
He will be punished

213
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:31,020
But he is connected to the Feng Palace

214
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,140
He has been in the palace for five years

215
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,140
By the will of the Emperor

216
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:45,800
Any

217
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,060
Mo Junyu shall be effected by our Logic

218
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:55,640
We shall eliminate his greatestcribing

219
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:59,740
According to the report of Cao Yunyan and Mo Qinglian

220
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,680
They will Chev Send

221
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,280
I'll go back to the suburb with you

222
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,120
and stay away from this place.

223
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,120
I'll make it up to you.

224
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,440
Why isn't it a Gu-abetted bowl that's used by Wu Guai?

225
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,280
Grand Commandant Cao sent someone here yesterday

226
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,240
and said that the Gu-abetted bowl that's used by the banquet

227
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,400
is missing a few.

228
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,800
So he took the few in your palace.

229
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,960
It hasn't been long since he took the throne.

230
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,720
He's already in the palace of Wu.

231
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,760
Forget it.

232
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,680
Leave us.

233
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:52,720
Yes.

234
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:02,000
The King of Jin, Grand Commandant Cao, the Marquis of Wu, is here to see you.

235
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:02,880
Summon him in.

236
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,080
Yes.

237
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,240
General Mo,

238
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,560
are you here for the reconstruction of the Mo Troop?

239
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,640
Yes.

240
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,600
General Mo just returned to the court.

241
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,360
He should rest and rest.

242
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,240
As for the reconstruction of the Mo Troop,

243
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,600
I've discussed with His Majesty

244
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,200
to seal the military camp first

245
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,680
and march into the Black Armor Army first.

246
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,600
Please give me your advice, General Qin Chuan.

247
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,120
I think

248
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,440
General Mo just returned to the Xia State.

249
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,680
He should get a written decree

250
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,560
and familiarize himself with military affairs.

251
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:53,440
And he should be the guard.

252
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:54,560
What do you think?

253
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:58,440
I'll follow the Empress Dowager's arrangement.

254
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,920
No doubt about it.

255
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,960
As for the general of the vanguard camp,

256
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,960
Prince Jing is the only one.

257
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,160
Empress Dowager,

258
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,880
General Qin Chuan is a great man.

259
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,680
If I'm above him,

260
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,280
I'm afraid it's not appropriate.

261
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,400
Since you're the vanguard of Prince Jing,

262
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,480
why can't you take the position of vanguard general?

263
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,560
Why don't you accept my decree?

264
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:28,640
I...

265
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,000
I idea.

266
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,280
General Mo won't surrender!

267
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,720
General Mo won't surrender!

268
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,640
General Mo won't surrender!

269
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,440
General Mo won't surrender!

270
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,120
General Mo won't surrender!

271
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,480
General Mo won't surrender!

272
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,480
General Mo won't surrender!

273
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,640
In the future,

274
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,000
we can work together代 stretch

275
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,400
we will fight for

276
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,320
Most disappears

277
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,240
Are you ready for the battle

278
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,880
I want to catch you

279
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,120
Here

280
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,640
Ok

281
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,320
it should be the Master.

282
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:48,180
It was no »

283
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:48,800
That is definite.

284
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,320
Heavenly Emperor.

285
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,800
I made a promise to the Heavenly Emperor.

286
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,800
Master!

287
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,400
Master! Little Brother!

288
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,200
You're finally back!

289
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,600
Let me tell you, I've been so bored these past few days.

290
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,400
I've been running around between the Prince of Jing's Manor and the Mo Manor every day.

291
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,000
You all didn't notice me.

292
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,600
Looks like my ghost shadow has improved again.

293
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Yes, Jiang Kui is the best.

294
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
As expected, you're the best.

295
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,400
You're the best.

296
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,800
As expected, I still prefer the Green Heart furnace.

297
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Then I'll come here every day to greet you.

298
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
Okay.

299
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,800
By the way, have the medicine for the cicada's head been delivered?

300
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,600
Yes, it's already here.

301
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,000
Is Master sick?

302
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,400
No, Master isn't sick.

303
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,000
It's all prepared for you.

304
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,200
Me?

305
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,200
Take off your clothes and wait for me inside.

306
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,600
Okay.

307
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,200
Take it off!

308
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,800
Why are you twisting it?

309
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,200
I'm so envious that I want to cry.

310
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,600
Not everyone can have this kind of treatment.

311
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,000
Jiang Kui.

312
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,600
Get out first.

313
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,800
Clean it up!

314
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,600
What?

315
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:24,200
Even Master can't see it?

316
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,000
Master...

317
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,200
is also a woman?

318
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,800
It's okay now.

319
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,200
Just soak it.

320
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,600
Okay.

321
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,400
Master, I think it's a good thing.

322
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:28,200
It's like being roasted by fire.

323
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,400
What does the heart mean?

324
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,800
The pulse is in contact with the heart.

325
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,200
It's also with the heart.

326
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,400
This method can be used to break the three-dimensional position.

327
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,400
Master, I think the magic is like flowing water.

328
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
It's much more powerful.

329
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,400
Now, you're not embarrassed anymore?

330
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,400
The method of Chief Ya Miao can only be used once.

331
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,800
From now on, you have to rely on yourself.

332
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,800
Master...

333
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,400
If it wasn't for you, it would be fine.

334
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,000
The Chou State delegation is about to arrive.

335
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
I wonder what you think about the Yi He?

336
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,400
I think that we should naturally fight.

337
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,800
I, Cao Huai Tai,

338
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,400
will be the one to lead the peace.

339
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,400
I will lead the peace.

340
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,400
I will lead the peace.

341
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,400
I will lead the peace.

342
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,400
I will lead the peace.

343
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,400
I will lead the peace.

344
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,400
What?

345
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,400
You also will lead the peace?

346
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
I have a simple idea.

347
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,560
I'm afraid of the situation.

348
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,120
I'll take the battle

349
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,360
that you've decided.

350
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,320
I've discussed with His Majesty.

351
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,520
If we can reach a peace talk with Chu,

352
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,840
and we can win the war,

353
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,000
it will be the blessing of our people.

354
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,960
I obey your order.

355
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,520
I

356
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,040
obey your order.

357
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,320
Prime Minister is allowed to leave.

358
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,080
Thank you.

359
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,200
Long live our people.

360
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,160
I think

361
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,280
the Western vu bow Está列

362
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,800
is a piece of cake.

363
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,180
Open it

364
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,860
as soon as possible.

365
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,920
Open it.

366
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,320
Open it.

367
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,080
Qingchuan Town used to be

368
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,360
secluded and barren.

369
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,880
It was so quiet.

370
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,920
The city of Helian Mountain was quiet.

371
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,320
The people of Qingchuan were smiling.

372
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,000
The people of Heaven were united.

373
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,800
Everything was harmonious.

374
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,240
But a year ago,

375
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,520
I came back from Qingchuan Town.

376
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,000
Under the iron mine on Helian Mountain,

377
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,320
I buried the bones of countless Qingchuan people.

378
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,040
In Qingchuan Town,

379
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,520
all the families became slaves of the iron.

380
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,680
But Qingchuan Town

381
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,440
became a prison.

382
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:52,800
I heard that

383
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,560
the people of Qingchuan

384
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:58,160
risked their lives to escape to Linya Town.

385
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,400
They would rather die under the horse-drawn horses of Chu people

386
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:04,480
than to return to their hometown.

387
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,600
But at the same time,

388
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,920
we were high-ranking people.

389
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,120
We didn't care about their calls

390
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,840
and just wanted to fight for peace.

391
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,480
We were so greedy.

392
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,880
The people of Qingchuan Town were in great trouble.

393
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,160
They were heartbroken.

394
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,120
Marquis Wu'an cared about the people.

395
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,080
He was afraid of the people.

396
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,280
But

397
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,320
before the victory,

398
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:39,320
they had to fight with each other.

399
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,920
If the people of Qingchuan Town knew that

400
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,600
they could use their sacrifice

401
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,400
to exchange for peace for five years,

402
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,960
it would be a great honor

403
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,960
for them.

404
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,400
The Empress Dowager's edict.

405
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:10,480
Mo Qingchuan of Wulian was framed by a villain.

406
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,760
Qingchuan's poem is old and new.

407
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,400
It's to restore the title of Marquis Wu'an

408
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,760
and to make it more beautiful.

409
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,240
I hope Mo Qingchuan will remember this

410
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,960
and give it more importance.

411
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,520
Don't forget the past.

412
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:41,680
You

413
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,600
need to retake this poem,

414
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,720
in my heart

415
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,440
and in her heart.

416
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,080
Master,

417
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,080
lich an edict

418
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,120
to Hasje comakers

419
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,840
and arrive in Beijing three days later.

420
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,640
Got it.

421
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:04,800
Master.

422
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,640
Don't follow me.

423
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,480
I'm afraid that I can't go back to my hometown.

424
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,480
I'm afraid that I can't go back to my hometown.

425
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,480
I'm afraid that I can't go back to my hometown.

426
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,480
I'm afraid that I can't go back to my hometown.

427
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,480
I'm afraid that I can't go back to my hometown.

428
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,480
I'm afraid that I can't go back to my hometown.

429
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,480
I'm afraid that I can't go back to my hometown.

430
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:41,480
I'm afraid that I can't go back to my hometown.

431
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,480
I'm afraid that I can't go back to my hometown.

432
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,480
I'm afraid that I can't go back to my hometown.

433
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,480
I'm afraid that I can't go back to my hometown.

434
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,480
I'm afraid that I can't go back to my hometown.

435
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,480
I'm afraid that I can't go back to my hometown.

436
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,480
I'm afraid that I can't go back to my hometown.

437
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,480
I'm afraid that I can't go back to my hometown.
