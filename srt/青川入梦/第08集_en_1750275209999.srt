Why are you all crying?

00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,620
That's to protect the country.

00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,780
The hero who sacrificed in the battlefield

43
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,620

Who is he?

46
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,900
His name is Mo Qingchuan.

47
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,100
He is also a hero.

48
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,220
If the Mo family is a sky,

49
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,140
Mo Qingchuan

50
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:01,100
will be the most important person in the sky.

51
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,780
From now on,

52
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,260
he will inherit the will of the Mo family

53
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,740
to protect us.

54
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,660

56
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,500
Wake up.

57
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,020
Open the door.

58
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:54,500
Yes!

59
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
You're right.

60
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,500
You're right.

61
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
What's the matter?

62
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:06,500
I'm Li Shun, the head of the secret investigation division.

63
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,500
The Chans' number is currently at 7.

64
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,500
The person who killed the king has been sealed.

65
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,500
Don't forget to take the Chans' number as your home.

66
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,500
Take him away immediately.

67
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
He's not here.

68
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Hold on!

69
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,500
Stop it.

70
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
Go.

71
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
Greetings, Minister Li.

72
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,500
I've been in touch with Chans' number.

73
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
However, Minister Li said that

74
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,500
the person who killed the king is from the Chans' house.

75
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,500
I want to confront him.

76
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,500
The investigation is underway.

77
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
The identity of the witness is not wrong.

78
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,500
I understand.

79
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,500
However, Minister Li, do you have any other evidence?

80
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
I don't.

81
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:06,500
The royal family of Jing is under the royal seal.

82
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,500
Not only because my father is the emperor of Yongping,

83
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,500
but also because he is the minister of the whole family.

84
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Minister Li heard the story and had no evidence.

85
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
He had to break into my family.

86
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,500
Since I let you in, how dare you?

87
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,500
You're lying.

88
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,500
The crown prince will be the witness.

89
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,500
I am.

90
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Mo Taiwei.

91
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,500
Mo Taiwei.

92
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Mo Taiwei.

93
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Mo Taiwei.

94
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Mo Taiwei.

95
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,500
I saw it with my own eyes.

96
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
You brought Mo Wang into the mansion last night.

97
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,500
Is my witness's share enough?

98
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
The share of the crown prince is of course enough.

99
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,500
I just said that Mo Wang is not in the royal family of Jing.

100
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,500
I don't believe it.

101
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,500
The crown prince also thinks that I don't believe it.

102
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,500
He wants to break into my family.

103
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
Please.

104
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,500
Search.

105
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,500
Who dares to break into the royal family?

106
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
Mo Taiwei.

107
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Mo Taiwei.

108
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,500
This is the imperial army of the empress dowager.

109
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,500
We are the empress dowagers.

110
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
We will guard the Prince of Jing's mansion.

111
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,500
If you don't have the order of the crown prince,

112
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,500
no one will come in.

113
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,500
When did he invite the empress dowagers to the mansion?

114
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,500
He should stay in the Prince of Jing's mansion.

115
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,500
He should never come out.

116
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,500
Protect this place.

117
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,500
Wait for me to come back.

118
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:26,500
Yes.

119
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,500
Who are your enemies?

120
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,500
Chen Siqi, Zhou Zheng,

121
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,500
Mo Junyu.

122
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:50,500
Do you know who is actually doing this?

123
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,500
He is so stubborn.

124
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,500
What's the point of being so stubborn?

125
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,500
I can't catch the assassin.

126
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,500
But Shen Xing is like a dead man who killed my father.

127
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:03,500
You mean there is a black hand behind you?

128
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,500
The rumor in the room is that

129
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
the person behind the lock-in door is related to the court.

130
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
I have no right or wrong.

131
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:12,500
I have no reason to go to the harem.

132
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
It's okay to say that.

133
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,500
The person who is now locked up is the royal family.

134
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,500
They dare to attack the royal family.

135
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,500
How can they help?

136
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Qi Guang.

137
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Are you sure you have another purpose?

138
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,500
I dare not.

139
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
I dare not.

140
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,500
My father is not in the harem.

141
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
If the Prince of Jing's Mansion is safe,

142
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,500
I am afraid.

143
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
What do you want to do?

144
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Can the Empress Dowager send the Ye Lin Army

145
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,500
to guard the Prince of Jing's Mansion?

146
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:46,500
The Ye Lin Army is at the very least.

147
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,500
It can also prevent the Empress Dowager from being punished.

148
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Is that all?

149
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,500
That's enough.

150
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,500
The Ye Lin Army has the responsibility to protect the royal family.

151
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
I am sure.

152
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,500
I thank the Empress Dowager for her kindness.

153
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
Your Highness.

154
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,500
They have searched the Chansi House for dirty water.

155
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,500
They have searched the Chansi House.

156
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Fortunately, the Dong family is prepared.

157
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:28,500
They didn't find anything important.

158
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,500
That's good.

159
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
How is the Dong family?

160
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
It's not awake yet.

161
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Qi Guang.

162
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
I want to ask you a question.

163
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
Please tell me.

164
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,500
I don't know

165
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
what the Prince of Mo's Mansion and the Prince of Jing's Mansion are.

166
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
But I think

167
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,500
he dares to come here today

168
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
to investigate the case.

169
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,500
Tomorrow,

170
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,500
he dares to investigate the Prince of the Black Armor Army

171
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
to attack the Prince of Jing's Mansion.

172
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
The Prince of Ye Lin Army

173
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
can't prevent the Prince of Jing's Mansion.

174
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,500
I want to ask you.

175
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,500
If the Prince of Zhaoyu

176
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
is attacked by the Chansi House,

177
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,500
can you protect the Prince of Shifu

178
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,500
and keep the secret?

179
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:08,500
I will do the arrangement.

180
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:10,500
Your Highness, please rest assured.

181
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
If this happens,

182
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
the Chansi House

183
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,500
will take care of everything and protect him.

184
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,500
Junior Brother.

185
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
What are you doing?

186
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,500
Where is the Prince of Shifu?

187
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Senior Sister, you are awake.

188
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Yes.

189
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
It's me, Fang Du.

190
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,500
You can't stop the fire.

191
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,500
The fire is on for 12 hours.

192
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,500
Don't be too hard on yourself.

193
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,500
Keep an eye on it.

194
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,500
Okay.

195
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:45,500
Senior Sister, let me do it.

196
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
Your wound is not healed yet.

197
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Let me do it.

198
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,500
I'll do it for you

199
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,500
after 6 hours.

200
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
Okay.

201
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,500
Coast Guard,

202
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,500
No.

203
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:09,500
Medical Physician Fang.

204
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,500
You have been

205
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:13,500
Joner Arm away the most.

206
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
Probably,

207
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:21,220
the burn,

208
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,500
the şöyle.

209
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,500
It can be evil.

210
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:26,500
The cooperation must be hard.

211
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,420
You're sick.

212
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,780
Can you give me a good medicine?

213
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:33,820
Okay.

214
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,300
But you'd better not get sick.

215
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:38,860
You're right.

216
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,180
These days will be hard.

217
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,580
I can cure him for now.

218
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,940
But he's not good at it.

219
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,900
He might get in the fire.

220
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,260
Don't be too hard on him.

221
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,740
Give me the bag.

222
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,060
I have something to do.

223
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:52,980
I'll go first.

224
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,660
Qiu Kui.

225
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,860
What a cute rabbit.

226
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,900
What did he call me?

227
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,500
Qiu Kui.

228
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,900
Why did he suddenly leave?

229
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,260
Who knows?

230
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,780
He's a great guy.

231
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,420
He's always secretive.

232
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,540
From the palace to the emperor's palace

233
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:29,540
How does he know my mom?

234
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:31,900
Tell me?

235
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:38,180
Sister.

236
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:42,540
You and Master know each other?

237
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,700
Miss, you're not莫...

238
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:50,780
What?

239
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,540
You think I'm fool?

240
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,660
It's Mother's decision.

241
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,660
I knew it.

242
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:04,660
Then I want to ask the world not to tell you that I know about this.

243
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,660
Why?

244
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,660
Since you don't want to tell me,

245
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:10,660
then there must be his reason.

246
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,660
I pretend to be ignorant.

247
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,660
Wait until you decide to tell me.

248
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,660
You're right.

249
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:24,660
Then can you tell me how you and Master know each other?

250
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:28,660
Okay.

251
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,660
Master and I met in the prison in Chu.

252
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,660
Have you heard of the Star Moon Sect in the hidden forest?

253
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,660
I have.

254
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,660
The rumors are quite mysterious.

255
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,660
They are all stories of some absurd and ridiculous.

256
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,660
That's right.

257
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,660
The Star Moon Sect is a sect on the surface.

258
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,660
But there is only one master.

259
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,660
My master Hong Yan likes to wander around everywhere.

260
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,660
He's so naughty.

261
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,660
Once he passed through the Star Moon Sect,

262
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,660
he said my brother was a genius.

263
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,660
He insisted on taking me to the mountain school.

264
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,660
He said he would let me go home after I finished school.

265
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:07,660
But when I got home,

266
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:12,660
I found that the Star Moon Sect had become the leader of Chu.

267
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,660
My parents were killed by the Chu army.

268
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,660
I was so angry that I killed many people in Chu.

269
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:26,660
Later, more and more people surrounded me.

270
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,660
At first, I thought I could fight.

271
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:36,660
I didn't expect that I could only accept defeat.

272
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:43,660
Then why didn't they kill you?

273
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:48,660
I don't know. Maybe they wanted to study my Ghost Shadow Sect.

274
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,660
Anyway, they caught me.

275
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,660
I met my master in the prison.

276
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:58,660
He was locked up by my side.

277
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,660
Every day, I was beaten to death.

278
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,660
What about me?

279
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:18,660
When I was separated from my master,

280
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,660
he said he would come to check my homework.

281
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:25,660
So I was taught by the master of the Red House for every day.

282
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,660
Until one day,

283
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,660
master Qingchuan spoke to me.

284
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,660
Guess what he said to me?

285
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,660
What did he say?

286
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:37,660
I was wrong.

287
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,380
What is it?

288
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:39,780
What is it?

289
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,580
I was wrong.

290
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,860
Master said I was different from yesterday.

291
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,900
But like the day before yesterday,

292
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,420
Master's memory is really good.

293
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,420
Then we became friends.

294
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,860
We told each other a lot of stories.

295
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,540
Then he was taken away by a man.

296
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:04,620
Who?

297
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,020
I don't know.

298
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,580
But he said he would come to pick me up.

299
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:10,980
He did it.

300
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:16,180
Then why did you defeat him?

301
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,740
Because I couldn't beat him.

302
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,620
Just kidding.

303
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,860
Although Master Hongyan is good,

304
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:27,020
Qingchuan is very good to me.

305
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,300
The most important thing is our goal is consistent.

306
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,620
And me.

307
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,180
Of course I know.

308
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,620
Master.

309
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:13,620
Master.

310
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,620
Master.

311
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,620
Are you awake?

312
00:16:34,620 --> 00:17:02,620
Master.

313
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:04,620
You took all my candy.

314
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,620
Brother, did you hide it for me secretly?

315
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,620
Give it back to me.

316
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,620
Master is in the prison.

317
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,620
It's okay if you don't give it to Tang.

318
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,620
When did you teach me to practice breaking the box?

319
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,620
You taught me so ungrateful.

320
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,620
Are you afraid that I will be learned?

321
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,620
You will defeat me, right?

322
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,620
It turns out that this is Master's memory.

323
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,620
But his brothers

324
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,620
have been fighting for their lives long ago.

325
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:47,620
I will keep it a secret.

326
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,620
I won't tell father.

327
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:04,620
He taught me to break the box.

328
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,620
Okay?

329
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,620
Master.

330
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,620
Master.

331
00:18:29,620 --> 00:18:30,620
Thank you, brother.

332
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,620
When I become the third child of the broken box,

333
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,620
I can fight with my brothers.

334
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,620
The battlefield is too dangerous.

335
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:40,620
I will protect you from now on.

336
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,620
Master.

337
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,620
Master.

338
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,620
Master.

339
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:03,620
What's wrong?

340
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,620
Go.

341
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,620
Go.

342
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,620
Master, what's wrong?

343
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:19,620
Wait, don't go.

344
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,620
Why?

345
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,620
I tried to suppress him.

346
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:22,620
I really can't fight him.

347
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,620
You are now going in and giving him death.

348
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,620
He is so aggressive.

349
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,620
He is so impetuous.

350
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,620
Then just let him go.

351
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,620
I can't fight him.

352
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,620
I can't do anything.

353
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,620
We can't fight him even if we are together.

354
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,620
Let him fight for his life.

355
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,620
When he is tired,

356
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,620
he will be relieved.

357
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,620
He needs to run faster when he is going to fight.

358
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,620
You can sleep well when he is left.

359
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,620
After all, he doesn't remember anything.

360
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,620
Master.

361
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:50,620
Does he often do this?

362
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,620
He doesn't do it often.

363
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,620
After all, he rarely needs to do it.

364
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,620
My medicine.

365
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,620
Master.

366
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,620
Why?

367
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,620
Why?

368
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,620
Why do you want me?

369
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,620
Why?

370
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,620
Ji Guang.

371
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,620
Jiang Kui.

372
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,620
Are you there?

373
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:05,620
Ji Guang is there.

374
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,620
He will be there forever.

375
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,620
Ji Guang.

376
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,620
Never betray master.

377
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,620
It's almost time.

378
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,620
Junior brother.

379
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,620
Master is awake.

380
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,620
Master.

381
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:54,620
Master.

382
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:56,620
Master.

383
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,620
Master.

384
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,620
Master.

385
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,620
You are awake.

386
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,620
You are injured.

387
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:10,620
Little injury.

388
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,620
The medicine that Fang Shan Yi prepared for you.

389
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,620
What's wrong?

390
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,620
Nothing.

391
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,620
Why don't you drink it?

392
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,620
It's not good.

393
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,620
It's hot.

394
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,620
You want to drink it?

395
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,620
Come on.

396
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:23,620
Master.

397
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,620
This medicine.

398
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:27,620
The medicine of Fang Shan Yi is so strange.

399
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,620
But effective.

400
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,620
Ji Guang.

401
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,620
What happened after I fainted?

402
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,620
I was in the Qingxin Hall.

403
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:51,620
Jiang Kui was injured.

404
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,620
Master, you are unconscious.

405
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:55,620
I brought you back to the Prince of Jing.

406
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:58,620
Then, the Chansi people were buried.

407
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:03,620
I tried to take you away from the body and the Mo Tai Wei.

408
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:04,620
I stopped you.

409
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,620
Brother Qi is dealing with the Chansi people.

410
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,620
Now, the situation is stable.

411
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,620
Nothing special happened?

412
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,620
Master, what's the point?

413
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,620
You are in the Qingxin Hall.

414
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,620
What do you see?

415
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:35,620
Qi Guang didn't see anything special.

416
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,620
Really?

417
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:37,620
Master.

418
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,620
Why did Mo Tai Wei treat you?

419
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,620
It's nothing.

420
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,620
After the Chansi people are settled,

421
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,620
I will go to the gate myself.

422
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,620
No matter what happens,

423
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,620
I will not let you go.

424
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,620
I will not let you go.

425
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,620
I will not let you go.

426
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,620
I will not let you go.

427
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,620
No matter what happens,

428
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,620
no matter who wants to hurt Master,

429
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:11,620
Qi Guang will always be there.

430
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,620
Take the medicine carefully.

431
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,620
Don't let the wound get infected.

432
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,620
Okay.

433
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,620
The wound...

434
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,620
has just healed.

435
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,620
It's so soft.

436
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,620
Only a little bit.

437
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,620
Don't be so mean.

438
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:46,620
After taking medicine,

439
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:53,620
I think it's time to put the medicine

440
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,620
on the wound.

441
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:59,620
Out of this severe situation,

442
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:04,220
One day, his feelings are like stepping on a sword.

443
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,620
He's afraid of any injuries.

444
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,260
After I get better,

445
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,140
we'll make him a doctor.

446
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:19,620
By the way, he wants to eat watermelon today.

447
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:21,740
Okay.

448
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,180
No.

449
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,540
How can master show his face

450
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:40,300
and drink such a bitter thing?

451
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,140
Little brother, eat watermelon.

452
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,100
Doctor Fang,

453
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,100
the food you made is much better than your medicine.

454
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,660
Master,

455
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:06,820
you ate watermelon.

456
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,100
Doctor Fang.

457
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,620
I prepared two servings.

458
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,020
I'll keep an eye on him every day

459
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,460
to remove the bad luck in his body.

460
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,700
But

461
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,700
I still have to keep my mouth shut.

462
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,420
After I finish eating,

463
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,180
I'll take this medicine.

464
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,300
I'll take the medicine every day.

465
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:26,820
But

466
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,340
can your hand be recovered?

467
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,900
It's bad luck.

468
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,100
Thank you, Doctor Fang.

469
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,380
You're welcome.

470
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,060
Things are getting better.

471
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,260
It's time to go back to the mountain to rest.

472
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,540
Then...

473
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,820
Don't bother him.

474
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,580
Don't leave. It's just a long journey.

475
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,220
We'll meet again in the mountains.

476
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,780
We'll meet again in the future.

477
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,500
He's a straightforward man.

478
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,300
He's a good man.

479
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:56,620
He's a good man.

480
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,340
But he's a good man.

481
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,620
Although I'm a good man,

482
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,180
I'm not as good as him.

483
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,060
He's a good man.

484
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:09,780
I'm leaving.

485
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,560
Here,

486
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:29,860
we can pass.

487
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,780
No.

488
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:32,940
Here,

489
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,740
here.

490
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,380
Here.

491
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,460
Give me a break.

492
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,420
I've been waiting for how long ...

493
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,000
How much longer will the Pork Boy become an activist?

494
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,060
Make him the one you love.

495
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,600
He does as you say.

496
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,360
How did your little uncle know that he liked the Drugley Soup?

497
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,320
He's great.

498
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,220
There seems to be something new.

499
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,820
Mo Qingchuan...

500
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:41,980
Now that we know that.

501
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,740
Looks like...

502
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,500
he knows.

503
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,700
Master.

504
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,220
Will Chen Zihao be in danger?

505
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,980
There'll be danger to Ji Lin all over.

506
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,980
Will it be dangerous after the battle?

507
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:12,980
It's time to go back.

508
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:15,980
To avoid it, we have to let the opponent get the Golden Mirror.

509
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,980
This sword is a little bit delicate.

510
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,980
It can be used to steal fake spells in three battles.

511
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,980
But it can't be used to defend the body.

512
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:26,980
When the body is said,

513
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,980
it's not necessary.

514
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,980
Don't use it.

515
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,980
I became someone's eye-catcher.

516
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,980
You hid me in the house.

517
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,980
I'm afraid you'll also fall in love with me.

518
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,980
Why are you laughing?

519
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,980
Yes, why are you laughing?

520
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,980
It's very dangerous.

521
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,980
Do you know that?

522
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,980
I know.

523
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,980
I just think

524
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,980
I can finally kill Master.

525
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,980
I'll wait for you in the red.

526
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,980
Master, wait for me.

527
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,980
Be careful.

528
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,980
Master, don't worry.

529
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,980
Don't worry about me.

530
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,980
I'll wait for you in the dark.

531
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,980
In the end,

532
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,980
I'll love you in the end.

533
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:47,980
Greetings, Master.

534
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:09,980
Mr. Jiuwen Mo's name is Duanwu.

535
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,980
I'm here to take care of you.

536
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:12,980
I've prepared

537
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:14,980
the favorite water and fire of Mrs. Mo.

538
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,980
I wonder if Mr. Mo

539
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,980
can come to the light.

540
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:28,980
I'm here to take care of you.

541
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,980
I wonder if Mr. Mo

542
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,980
can come to the light.

543
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:39,980
I'll take care of you.

544
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,980
The moon is hidden.

545
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,980
The year is turning.

546
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:05,980
The path is desolate.

547
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,980
The cold and cold of the Dragon.

548
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:11,980
The hometown is gone.

549
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,980
I look forward to the end of my life.

550
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:18,980
I'm like a dream.

551
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:22,980
The wind and fire are burning.

552
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,980
The horse and the gold are singing.

553
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:27,980
The sun shines on the moon.

554
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,980
The night is small.

555
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,980
The night is beautiful.

556
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,980
The only wish is to live a happy life.

557
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,980
The sky is white.

558
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:39,980
The season is deep.

559
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:41,980
The moon is hidden.
