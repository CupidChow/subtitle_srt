1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The Crown Prince

2
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,120
one,two.

3
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,080
Ling Jun.

4
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:51,040
You were totally defeated and

5
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,080
How could you pain樂

6
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,120
long time ago?

7
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,880
mother.

8
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,920
What else can we do?

9
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,600
Do you want to stop

10
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,800
a great danger?

11
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,120
Okay.

12
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,760
I'll do my best.

13
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,800
I'll do it even if I die.

14
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,880
But,

15
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,400
do you know about this?

16
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,560
I don't want him

17
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,000
to be involved.

18
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,520
What keeps you from being a great soldier

19
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,280
but you make yourself

20
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,000
suffer governor'ses?

21
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,240
Alright.

22
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,240
I knew you absolutely

23
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,120
are not a good man.

24
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,980
Xiao Sect Leader found ways to

25
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,540
stop miss Sedan,

26
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,120
our reverse mission

27
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,480
and run away from here.

28
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,560
I want destroyed all of these again.

29
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:56,020
Xiao Gen ay your

30
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:58,020
Come with me.

31
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,500
Goodbye, Senior Sister.

32
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,500
Junior Brother,

33
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,540
Master asked you to go back and have a walk.

34
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,220
Master,

35
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,580
is she okay?

36
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:16,900
She's fine.

37
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:17,980
What's wrong with her?

38
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:22,100
Why don't you come with me?

39
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,500
I'm fine.

40
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,180
Qi Guang,

41
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,700
if time could stop,

42
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,620
where would you like to return to?

43
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,780
Twelve years ago,

44
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,780
when you came to the capital,

45
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,020
I saw the first sight of you.

46
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,820
And then?

47
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,780
I will tell you

48
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,460
everything I planned.

49
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,580
You won't experience the consequences.

50
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,420
Twelve years ago,

51
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,580
the Green Hills hadn't grown old,

52
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,300
and the sun was rising.

53
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,820
But when I look back,

54
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,100
I don't remember the thousand-man lake,

55
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,500
the ten thousand-man empty house,

56
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,580
but

57
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,100
a pair of eyes.

58
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,220
I remember.

59
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,780
Of course I remember.

60
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:32,900
It's rare to see such bright eyes.

61
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,780
Master.

62
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:38,260
Time can't stop.

63
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,260
Mo Qing Chuan is already in the past.

64
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,140
The past is the hero.

65
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,260
Qi Guang,

66
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,780
from now on,

67
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,740
you are the hero of the country.

68
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,860
From now on,

69
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,020
I only hope that you can live a peaceful life.

70
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,540
As long as you're happy,

71
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,580
whether you're a hero or not,

72
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,780
I don't care.

73
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,820
I will always

74
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,780
be by your side.

75
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,140
With me,

76
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,700
you don't need to marry Feng Shiyan.

77
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,580
Don't be silly.

78
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,260
You're young and powerful.

79
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:14,020
You'll be married and have a good family.

80
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,900
There are many women who are suitable for you in the capital.

81
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,100
But I don't want to marry them.

82
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:17,900
I just want to...

83
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,580
Master,

84
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,580
I bought it back.

85
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,940
I bought it all.

86
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,020
Why are you two drinking behind my back?

87
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,180
Master,

88
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,260
this is your bag.

89
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,540
Look.

90
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,180
The sole is thick.

91
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,580
It's durable and waterproof.

92
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:36,740
Master,

93
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,860
why don't you try it too?

94
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,500
It's a long journey.

95
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,580
You can't wear good shoes.

96
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,940
Where are you going?

97
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,540
I'm going to swim in the capital.

98
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,740
I'm going to swim in the capital.

99
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,940
I'm going to swim in the capital.

100
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,660
I'm going to swim in the capital.

101
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,700
This time, I went to Chu with Feng Shiyan.

102
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,340
I don't plan to go back to the country.

103
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,340
So I want to take a good look.

104
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,180
Master.

105
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,180
Are you really going to marry him?

106
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,660
Yes.

107
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,100
This land is no longer a place for me to live.

108
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,420
Only in Chu

109
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,140
can there be a little peace.

110
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,020
You helped me back then

111
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,540
and said you would let me repay you someday.

112
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,020
Now I'm the Prince of Jin.

113
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,820
I lead the vanguard camp.

114
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:35,540
Master.

115
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,060
I've repaid you.

116
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,380
Don't you want it?

117
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,580
No.

118
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,060
From now on,

119
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,580
you don't owe me anything.

120
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,260
But why is it Feng Shiyan?

121
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,300
Why is it him?

122
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,780
In the world,

123
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,100
who else would dare to marry me

124
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,180
except him?

125
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,340
Of course there is.

126
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,660
And...

127
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:06,900
Xia Qiguang.

128
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,660
The words have come to an end.

129
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,340
I've made up my mind.

130
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,500
You may leave.

131
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,340
Little brother.

132
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,660
I know you're anxious.

133
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,260
But don't be anxious.

134
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,780
These days,

135
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,620
I'll go out with Master for a few days.

136
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,580
When he's in a good mood,

137
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,780
I'll help you persuade him.

138
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,380
When are you going to leave?

139
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,580
The day after tomorrow.

140
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,140
Little brother.

141
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,460
Actually, you should feel happy for him.

142
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,780
Although he's having a hard time,

143
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,580
at least he's lucky.

144
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:12,580
Lucky?

145
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:14,900
Yes.

146
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,100
How many people in the world

147
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,820
know what they want?

148
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,020
Master said,

149
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:27,580
it's a good thing to have someone you like.

150
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,480
Wow.

151
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:01,740
Master.

152
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:03,180
You think it over?

153
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,020
We preconceived little brother

154
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,300
to go on a trip in the future.

155
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,780
Is it too cruel?

156
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,380
It's enough to be a traitor.

157
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,660
You were the one who said he was useful.

158
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,100
Now you are the one who doesn't want to give up.

159
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,700
I can't let him find out about Duan Ni.

160
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,940
I can't let him get involved in it.

161
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:35,820
Fine.

162
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,700
The Empress Dowager

163
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,260
will be the biggest vote I've ever made.

164
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,260
The Empress Dowager's birthday is tomorrow.

165
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,260
Look at the highly heleating sleek light,

166
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,780
the elegant ehang every around.

167
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,020
Look again at this rouge

168
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,900
that our Europe has just taken on the introvert beauty.

169
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,580
Glow

170
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,860
is layer not to piano.

171
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,460
And this strangely Итак hairpin

172
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,460
is meant to give life and harmony.

173
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,440
Looks like Lan Fu

174
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,440
It's really suitable.

175
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,440
Help me put it on.

176
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,440
Empress Dowager, Prince Jing and General Cao have arrived.

177
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,440
Call them in.

178
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,440
You all leave.

179
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,440
Yes.

180
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
This Su Qi, Su Qi.

181
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:06,440
From a little trouble to a eunuch.

182
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,440
This many years of management.

183
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
This Feng Shi Ye,

184
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
He is really thoughtful.

185
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,440
Empress Dowager, why don't you order

186
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,440
to arrest that dog slave?

187
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,440
No rush.

188
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,440
These days, he has been taking care of

189
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,440
the people around me.

190
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,440
I want to see

191
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,440
what kind of good show

192
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,440
he has arranged.

193
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,440
This may be

194
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,440
a chance to get a chance to get a chance.

195
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
I have an unexpected gift.

196
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,440
I called you all here today

197
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,440
for tomorrow's birthday.

198
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,440
Empress Dowager, don't worry.

199
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
I have already made a lot of preparations in the palace.

200
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
No one will dare to do anything.

201
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,000
Does this apply to me?

202
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I really don't want it.

203
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Come.

204
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It's so beautiful.

205
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,880
You have a good taste.

206
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,240
Look at the thick sole.

207
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,600
It's durable and doesn't get wet.

208
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,520
I want a pair.

209
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,520
Master.

210
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,640
Yes.

211
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,560
If she can get well in the future,

212
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,800
why should I stop her?

213
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:08,840
This is...

214
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,840
This is...

215
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,280
This is...

216
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
This is...

217
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,960
This is...

218
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,200
This is...

219
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:17,440
This is...

220
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,600
This is...

221
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,760
This is...

222
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,880
This is...

223
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,080
This is

224
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
this.

225
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,480
This.

226
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,360
And this.

227
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,320
Why is this women'sыв까요?

228
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,760
This is old...

229
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,720
I don't need what young women need.

230
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,040
Apply some ointment to her body

231
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,480
Push her UVы

232
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:47,720
Fish bone cure

233
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,280
Get rid of the sorcery

234
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
I heard the old woman said

235
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,640
similar liked that fish bone cure

236
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
This is...

237
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The year of the ninth month.

238
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,400
Isn't it the birthday of the Empress Dowager tomorrow?

239
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Why are you here?

240
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I have something to do. I'll go now.

241
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Who is it?

242
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
Your Highness.

243
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You are going to attend the birthday banquet of the Empress Dowager.

244
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
But you still want to die.

245
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
What are you going to do?

246
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I said yesterday that you don't owe me anything.

247
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
My business has nothing to do with you.

248
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
Go.

249
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Let go.

250
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Let go.

251
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I told you to let go. Xia Qiguang.

252
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Mo Qingchuan.

253
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
You are a liar.

254
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I could not be your place in this life.

255
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I could also watch you go away.

256
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I could not call your name in this life.

257
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
But you...

258
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
You never want to live.

259
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
You never want to live.

260
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
You lied to me.

261
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
You made me believe that you were just a student who had just graduated from Yuanmen.

262
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
But your body came.

263
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Mo Qingchuan.

264
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
How could you say such a thing?

265
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
You can do whatever you want.

266
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
But you...

267
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You can't.

268
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
I'm begging you.

269
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
If you want to stop me, you can kill me now.

270
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Or you can kill me at the birthday banquet tomorrow.

271
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
You are loyal to the country.

272
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
And in two hours, I will be a traitor to the country.

273
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Master.

274
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,000
I'm so tired.

275
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm so tired.

276
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I'm so tired.

277
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Do you know why I named Mo Wang?

278
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
Because I hate him.

279
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
So do you think I'm tired?

280
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It's almost dawn.

281
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Jiang Kui.

282
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
Let's go.

283
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Go.

284
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Doughnut

285
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Send Su Qi a signal.

286
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,960
Some services cards staff

287
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,580
here

288
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,420
You don't open the staff

289
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:30,560
So, the minced meat

290
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:32,540
I don't have it

291
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,740
Where did your master go this morning

292
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,300
This morning

293
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:39,660
last night

294
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,560
Solitude

295
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:43,760
So

296
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,520
Yes.

297
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,520
By the way,

298
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,960
after the Empress Dowager's breakfast,

299
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,840
let's go to see her

300
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,520
in person.

301
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,640
So early?

302
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,440
No one is there.

303
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:10,800
The birthday is on the day of the

304
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,520
Empress Dowager's wedding.

305
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,320
Yes.

306
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,600
After all, you are the most trusted person

307
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:15,840
of the Empress Dowager.

308
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,440
Your Majesty,

309
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,200
the Empress Dowager went to see you in person.

310
00:20:36,520 --> 00:20:37,480
I see.

311
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:39,920
You may leave.

312
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,400
Yes.

313
00:20:44,240 --> 00:21:04,700
dai

314
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,880
Su Qi.

315
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,880
You really know nothing.

316
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,880
This is indeed the most quiet place in the palace.

317
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
I'm afraid that you'll be tired today.

318
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,880
I ordered the imperial cook to cook you a bowl of tonic.

319
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
Are you going to drink it now?

320
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,880
Drink it.

321
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,880
You really have a heart.

322
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,880
Bring it up.

323
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,880
I'm going to eat it.

324
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,880
You, you, I...

325
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,880
I'll eat it.

326
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,880
You don't have to.

327
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,880
What do you think I'm doing?

328
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,880
You're a girl.

329
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,880
I'm not afraid of you.

330
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,880
I'm not afraid of you.

331
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
If you don't want it,

332
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,880
I'll eat it.

333
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,880
I'm afraid that you'll get tired.

334
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,880
I'm afraid that you'll get tired.

335
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,880
I'm afraid that you'll get tired.

336
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,880
I'm afraid that you'll get tired.

337
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,260
Let go of me.

338
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,920
How dare you do this to me!

339
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,700
representations

340
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,420
Who sent you here?

341
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,140
Your little aunt

342
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,480
R dadurch

343
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,280
Kill him

344
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,760
Qingzhi!

345
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,560
Count Lastly,

346
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,440
Zhaizhen will win back the Heaven's will with Z insane.

347
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,640
Alright.

348
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,120
And my mother will rest in peace!

349
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,360
Xiao Qi Hong!

350
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,460
Do you want to be atrocious?

351
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,600
No!

352
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,520
I'm just following the fate

353
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,400
and following the true master of the Xia Dynasty.

354
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,600
Mother.

355
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,960
Qi Ye?

356
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,800
I didn't expect that.

357
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,000
I raised him myself.

358
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:48,000
He's a wolfie.

359
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,960
He'll bite people.

360
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,280
Empress Dowager Cao killed the loyal and virtuous Duke He.

361
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,840
She's gone to Chu

362
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,240
and has committed a crime of invading the country.

363
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,200
She has lost all her trust in the people today.

364
00:23:59,280 --> 00:23:59,960
Cao Huai Tai,

365
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,560
are you going to rebel

366
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,760
by pointing your knife at His Majesty?

367
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:05,840
You're the one who's going to rebel.

368
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,200
I'm telling you

369
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,840
that the Xia Dynasty

370
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,520
is already in a state of chaos.

371
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,840
If it weren't for Empress Dowager's

372
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,720
wildness,

373
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,000
you wouldn't be standing here.

374
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,720
If it weren't for the Empress Dowager's good intentions,

375
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,720
you would have

376
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,120
changed the dynasty

377
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,760
and changed the name of Cao.

378
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,440
Imperial Physician Cao,

379
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:27,800
please pay attention to your manners.

380
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:28,600
Shut up!

381
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,440
I respect you for your life

382
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,360
because you're the son of the Empress Dowager.

383
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,720
Otherwise,

384
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,640
even if you're the Heavenly King,

385
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,040
I won't accept you.

386
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,680
Here goes.

387
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,640
In the name of Funing,

388
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,000
I hereby

389
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,320
wish to take what

390
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,240
this wonderful opportunity

391
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,520
of Ab CNN

392
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,440
to calls for thejam.

393
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:04,320
What do you want, Your Majesty?

394
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,360
I want to protect my father.

395
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:07,520
What do you think?

396
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,560
Are you his mother?

397
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,360
Today,

398
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,760
even if His Majesty is successful,

399
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,880
when the people's strength is withdrawn,

400
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,960
the Qingliu will react.

401
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,760
They are only

402
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,000
a cruel disciple

403
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,080
who doesn't even let go of his own mother.

404
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,880
He is a cunning man

405
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,240
who has been ungrateful for ten years.

406
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,440
If you dare to make any mistakes,

407
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,080
you will be punished by their mouth.

408
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,800
You will also bear the mistakes

409
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,680
of Lian Wu.

410
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,800
In the future,

411
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,160
if there are people who are suitable for the throne,

412
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,520
they will abandon you

413
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,040
and treat you like a child.

414
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,320
For example,

415
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,240
Prince Jing, Xia Qiguang.

416
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,200
Your Majesty.

417
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,280
When the new Princess

418
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,960
is writing the history book,

419
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,760
how should she write it?

420
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,640
I guess

421
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,960
it will be like Yin Changyan.

422
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,560
No matter how many times you attack,

423
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,280
you will only leave four words.

424
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,960
She is my mother's daughter.

425
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,840
a peach blossom
