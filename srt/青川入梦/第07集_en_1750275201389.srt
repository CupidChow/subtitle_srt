00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Since you never talk,

00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,500
I'll call you Xiao Hei.

71
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:08,500
If you don't talk,

72
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,500
you'll be a stranger.

73
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,500

74
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:14,500

I'll call you Xiao Hei.

79
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
I'll call you Xiao Hei.

80
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,500
I made a mistake

81
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
when I was young.

82
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
I was punished and banned.

83
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,500
Father locked me up.

84
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,500
I left the place to look for my mother.

85
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,500
But I couldn't find her.

86
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,500
I found a silver silk book.

87
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,500
I took so long for it.

88
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,500
That's the best dessert I've ever had.

89
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,500
Later, you told me that it's the silver silk of the Zhou season.

90
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,500
From then on, I'll buy it as long as I want to.

91
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:16,500
Xiao Hai, why don't you help me to send my letter to my mother?

92
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,500
My mother is the most elegant and most noble woman in the world.

93
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,500
She loves me the most. She'll give you the best thing and try to save me.

94
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Really? Can't I just leave?

95
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,500
Write it down. Actually, I've been thinking for a long time.

96
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,500
You've been keeping an eye on me, but you're not too bad.

97
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,500
At least, you didn't win the project.

98
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:55,500
I'm still your enemy, right?

99
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,500
You dare not kill me and let me go.

100
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:07,500
But, I'm too helpless to stay alone.

101
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
How about...

102
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
You guys kill me.

103
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,500
You guys kill me.

104
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,500
Please kill me!

105
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,500
Xiao Hai, Xiao Hai! Xiao Hai!

106
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,500
I'm still being rejected.

107
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,500
It's okay.

108
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,500
It's okay to live.

109
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
Just live like this.

110
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,500
Your mom said that the people here are too cold to fight her.

111
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:13,500
And, she's Installian from elementary school.

112
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,500
Mom,Derials, shall we go?

113
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,500
Nothing else.

114
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,980
Zhu Ze

115
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,500
I'm here.

116
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:58,980
Great.

117
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,260
I can finally go back to the bottom.

118
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,540
Do you want to know who he is?

119
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:13,780
Xiao Hei.

120
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,460
Mother.

121
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,660
Get him out of here.

122
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,060
Love,

123
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,740
and your life expression.

124
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,340
You're my brother here.

125
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,340
Mi name...

126
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,780
Ni name...

127
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:41,900
Su potion.

128
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,860
I could drop you out.

129
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,860
Is the man ready?

130
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,900
I can't remember.

131
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,080
Didn't the neurological operation

132
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,200
make a difference?

133
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,900
Yes, doush wizard!

134
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:05,040

135
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,720

136
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,820
Spiderjetlar!

137
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,340
Spiderjetlar!

138
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,960
Do you know

139
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Why did I come back to Xia Guang?

140
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,560
I understand.

141
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,560
So,

142
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,960
I'm just a blind man.

143
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,360
I'm just a joke.

144
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
Qing Ling,

146
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,960
I have something important to tell you.

147
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,960
I need to do something for the rest of my life.

148
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,360
I understand.

149
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,960
I've been in the prison.

150
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,760
I've seen Qing Chuan.

151
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,360
You're awake, Xiaohui.

152
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,160
You fainted just now.

153
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,160
Are you okay?

154
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:49,960
Xiaohui,

155
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
I'm thinking,

156
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,760
do you come to visit me often?

157
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,360
Do you feel the same way as me?

158
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,560
Do you feel the same way as me?

159
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:06,560
It's okay.

160
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,560
Just like the seed you gave me,

161
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,560
there's always something to blossom.

162
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,160
The body was found under the sea of ​​chongkong in the city.

163
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,760
Who killed him?

164
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,160
Yes.

165
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,160
Mo Qing Chuan.

166
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,760
He was so arrogant.

167
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,160
He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to hide.

168
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,760
Will you hate him for me?

169
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
Master.

170
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,760
Master.

171
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,760
Master.

172
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,760
In your heart,

173
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,560
I'm more important than Mo Qing Chuan.

174
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,560
Qigong.

175
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
It turns out that

176
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:09,560
I'm different from Master and Mo Qing Chuan.

177
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,160
Master.

178
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
Where have you been?

179
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
I've seen an old friend.

180
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,560
Old friend?

181
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,560
A friend I treasured.

182
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,160
Why didn't Qigong hear about it?

183
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,160
Master, you still have such a friend in the capital?

184
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,560
Maybe you'll meet him in the future.

185
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,760
You two look alike.

186
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:34,160
You might be very fated.

187
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Very similar?

188
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,760
Is it normal to be with Qigong?

189
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,560
A little bit more mature than you.

190
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:45,160
Then, should Qigong be changed to a new one?

191
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:46,960
Yes.

192
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,560
Then, why don't you bring Qing Lei wine to him?

193
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,160
Okay.

194
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,960
I'll bring it to him next time.

195
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,760
Master, in Qigong's eyes,

196
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,760
Master and Qigong are not alike.

197
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,360
Qigong.

198
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,760
Junior brother, I'll be in the morning tomorrow.

199
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:14,760
Let's eat together.

200
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,760
Yes.

201
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,760
Master.

202
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,760
Junior brother, what's wrong?

203
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,760
Mo Qing Chuan.

204
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,960
You really came back?

205
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,160
Since he chose Qian'en Manor,

206
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,160
he can't let him open the door before the world.

207
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,560
Yes.

208
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,760
My wine is only for Master.

209
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,960
But Master can change anyone.

210
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,160
Clearly!

211
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,160
Master is upset.

212
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,960
His anger hasn't Inside what he wrote.

213
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,960
Master couldn't read.

214
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,960
Your anger isn't Chun entschieden Thirteenth Master.

215
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,560
Oh yeah.

216
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,960
Tomorrow is the birthday of Senior Sister.

217
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,460
What good will you buy?

218
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,460
Master's sweet and sour pork ribs are so delicious.

219
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,960
No, Master's everything is delicious.

220
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,460
Okay, get ready to eat.

221
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,960
Okay.

222
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:51,960
By the way, Master, I forgot to buy watermelon.

223
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,960
I just tried the watermelon.

224
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,460
I want to eat it.

225
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:57,960
Okay, I'll go buy it with you.

226
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,960
Oh no, I forgot to buy the watermelon.

227
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,960
Master, do you have money?

228
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,960
No, Master's money is all here.

229
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:09,960
I'll go get it.

230
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,960
Master, wait for me. I'll be right back.

231
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,460
Jiang Kun!

232
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,460
Master...

233
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,460
I...

234
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,460
Since you're here,

235
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,960
just die here.

236
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,460
Come.

237
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,460
Master, don't!

238
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,460
Master!

239
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,460
Master!

240
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,460
Master!

241
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,460
20...

242
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,460
30...

243
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:42,460
Such a powerful knife. Why didn't I hear about it before?

244
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:46,460
Why didn't I see you use the Mo family's knife before?

245
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,460
Why did you lie to me?

246
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:54,460
So, this is the real destruction.

247
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,460
Master!

248
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,460
Master!

249
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,460
Master!

250
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,460
Master!

251
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:11,460
Master!

252
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,460
Master!

253
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,460
How are you?

254
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,460
Master has a wound.

255
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,460
We can't stay here for long.

256
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,460
Who attacked you?

257
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,460
I don't know.

258
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,460
Who are your enemies?

259
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:42,460
Chen Siqi, Zhou Zheng, Mo Junyu...

260
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,460
And...

261
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:44,460
Can you hold on?

262
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,460
Yes.

263
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,460
We can't stay here anymore.

264
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,460
We have to go.

265
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,460
Where?

266
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,460
In the Prince's Mansion.

267
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,460
Senior Sister, take a seat.

268
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:10,460
Here, take the medicine.

269
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,460
Master!

270
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,460
If you see him one day,

271
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:57,460
he will tell you in person.

272
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,460
He will tell you in person.

273
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,460
He has been looking for you.

274
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,460
I have met General Mo Junshan for a long time.

275
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:06,460
Now I am suspicious.

276
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,460
I am the traitor Mo Qingchuan.

277
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,460
Actually, I used to be the old man of the Mo family.

278
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:12,460
I have been hiding for a long time.

279
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:16,460
I am the one who saved you and me.

280
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,460
Come with me.

281
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:25,460
Master, you are Mo Qingchuan.

282
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:29,460
Yinchuan City, Xuxia City.

283
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,460
Yinchuan City, Yinchuan City.

284
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,460
Please, two things.

285
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:37,460
First, find a famous doctor.

286
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,460
And get the new doctor.

287
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,460
Second, protect this place.

288
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,460
Wait for me to come back.

289
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,460
Yes.

290
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,460
Mo Qingchuan has not only recovered,

291
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,460
but also recovered.

292
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,460
He has recovered.

293
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,460
He has become so much better.

294
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,460
Yes.

295
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,460
But he is still in a good mood.

296
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:06,460
He seems to be injured.

297
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,460
He was saved by Xia Qi Guang in the Prince of Jiang's Mansion.

298
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:13,460
He must not be recovered.

299
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,460
Find an excuse to investigate the case.

300
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,460
I will take down the Mo Wang.

301
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,460
If he dares to resist,

302
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:27,460
I will make him pay for his crime.

303
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,460
Master Shi.

304
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:33,460
The general is resting.

305
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,460
The capital is just back.

306
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,460
He is treating Mr. Mo.

307
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,460
The capital?

308
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,460
Mr. Mo's uncle.

309
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,460
The capital is almost broken.

310
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,460
I can only take care of it.

311
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,460
I am very good at the medical skills of my uncle.

312
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:47,460
If I have the chance to meet him,

313
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,460
I will take you to meet him.

314
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,460
I understand.

315
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,460
Come in.

316
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:15,460
Both hands and hands are almost broken.

317
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,460
The front window is white.

318
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,460
The air is warm.

319
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,460
The back window is white.

320
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:23,460
The front window is warm.

321
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:26,460
So he suffered so much in Chu.

322
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,460
You are his disciple.

323
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,460
The crown prince who broke the crystal.

324
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,460
Xia Qi Guang.

325
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,460
He sent a letter to me earlier.

326
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,460
He asked me to come back to you.

327
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,460
Master, how is he?

328
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,460
He is fine.

329
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,460
He is looking for you.

330
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,460
It looks like the fetal is left as far as possible.

331
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,460
You cannot see the muscle chorus frompineilis.

332
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,460
How is it?

333
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,460
The details were confirmed.

334
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:21,600
Explorer thought the same.

335
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,440
She thought we had a war still.

336
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,960
tan side- provide nobody.

337
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,420
Even in the bad times year is not to know.

338
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,900
allowed toarina

339
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,780

341
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,860

on fine

352
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,780
He was forced into a deep place.

353
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,340
That's why he practiced such a bad technique.

354
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,580
Don't let him be in the cave.

355
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,380
Otherwise, he'll die.

356
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,380
Send me back one day.

357
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,860
I water now.

358
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,980
How to do it?

359
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,180
Do I have to stand here?

360
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,020
After thehanГethe's amounts of ants.

361
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,180
There are about twenty of them,

362
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,460
collaborate with them and give them money.

363
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,580
It's written on theした.

364
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,380
girl.
