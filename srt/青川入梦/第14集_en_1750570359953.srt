1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,600
Economic Department

2
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,720
Quickly, madam, quickly come down

3
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,320
be careful

4
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,800
lady, lady, be careful

5
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I sent all of the troops to The South already,

6
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,440
hoping to Governor اير HERE.

7
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,200
And right now,

8
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,120
Governor م spielen,

9
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,240
he is in there,

10
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,400
he is humiliated.

11
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,620
He is watching you,

12
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,360
and his following,

13
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,940
what's wrong in his eyes,

14
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,960
he is scared.

15
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,560
And people watching him,

16
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,560
People watching him...

17
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,160
His eyes are rivet,

18
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,080
and watching outside,

19
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,380
what would happen if he started that Уhidomb?

20
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,020
Any president

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,640
taking pity on me

22
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:18,860
is the

23
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,940
choice

24
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,420
Don't be anxious.

25
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,820
Your time is not up yet.

26
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,660
Let me present you with a story.

27
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,640
In the past,

28
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,100
there was a goddess

29
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,720
fell into the Very Effect Loular,

30
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,220
under the medical treatment of thousands of demons.

31
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,380
Ming He was bitten by thousands of demons.

32
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,980
Day after day,

33
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,740
year after year.

34
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:08,340
Even if he was bitten to death,

35
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:10,820
he survived.

36
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,940
Do you know why he survived?

37
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,820
Was it because someone was waiting for him to go back?

38
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:24,580
No.

39
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,700
It was because

40
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:32,460
someone was afraid that he wouldn't go back.

41
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,340
So,

42
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,900
you want to go back?

43
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,020
The pain I suffered

44
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:03,580
will be paid off

45
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:07,380
if you push me into Ming He.

46
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,100
What did you say?

47
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,220
Mo Qingchuan doesn't want to marry?

48
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,420
It's too late.

49
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,340
He's in the lower realm now.

50
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,380
He's in the right hands.

51
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,780
If he doesn't want to marry,

52
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,900
the Empress Dowager can't force him.

53
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,300
It's impossible for him to get more than 30% of the goods.

54
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,700
What should we do now?

55
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,380
If the peace pact breaks,

56
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,900
the Second Prince will take the opportunity to bite His Highness.

57
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:34,700
Then,

58
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,980
everything the King promised His Highness

59
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,380
will be wasted.

60
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,620
I have a way to deal with the Empress Dowager.

61
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,580
As for Qingchuan,

62
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,780
she used an excuse to reject me.

63
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,380
It's just a wish for the lower dynasty.

64
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,220
That's good.

65
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,940
It's good to let her understand

66
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,100
that Mo Qingchuan is just a random item

67
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:00,740
that can be traded with the lower dynasty.

68
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,580
It's been three years.

69
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,700
She should let me go back to the State of Chu.

70
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,540
It's troublesome.

71
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:17,220
Mo Qingchuan is higher and higher in the lower realm.

72
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,660
But for our State of Chu,

73
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,740
it's just a joke.

74
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,980
If you still disrespect her,

75
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,100
I'll kill you.

76
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,500
Get out.

77
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,580
Yes.

78
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,180
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,220
General Qingchuan is back.

80
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,060
With him as the Mo's Army,

81
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,460
what else can we do?

82
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:40,180
Yes.

83
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,820
What good will Chu do?

84
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,740
Is the Chi Shi of the lower realm

85
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,220
a beast?

86
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,700
So hard to eat.

87
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,540
What did you say just now?

88
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,900
Move.

89
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,340
Behave yourself.

90
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,460
You...

91
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,620
General Li, the overall situation is important.

92
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,820
With General Mo,

93
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,100
do you think we'll be afraid of your Chu people?

94
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,100
Mo Qingchuan?

95
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,380
Do you think he's great?

96
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:24,220
He's been a man of the lower realm for a long time.

97
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,100
He even has a child.

98
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,500
Shut up.

99
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,420
What a joke.

100
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,380
Go.

101
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:38,340
I heard that General Mo is the one who sealed the stone leaf.

102
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:40,620
No way.

103
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,540
He should be named Yusui,

104
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,220
not Wa Quan.

105
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,300
What are you talking about?

106
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,380
Mo Qingchuan is the prince of Chu.

107
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,300
The stone leaf.

108
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,380
Who sent it?

109
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,020
General Li Feng, the general of the stone leaf.

110
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,420
He said it in Wangyue Restaurant.

111
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,780
Many people heard it.

112
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,660
Stone leaf.

113
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,340
What are you doing?

114
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,620
Î lo qi qi qù qẹ lì ph Jos glad月

115
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:19,700
Maybe you should ask him yourself.

116
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,780
What did you say about Nammou?

117
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,260
He suffered a lot in Chu,

118
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,340
Sami PVC

119
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,760
What do you want?

120
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,480
Kill me.

121
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,640
Then I will rule the baking film.

122
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,560
Right.

123
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,040
I am killing you now.

124
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,800
Why?

125
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,880
Stop!

126
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:57,920
Master!

127
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,840
Go.

128
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,880
You think you can defeat him?

129
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,760
There are some things in the world

130
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:05,760
Do you know?

131
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:30,760
I do.

132
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
I'm sorry.

133
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,760
Go.

134
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,760
I must kill him today.

135
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,760
Master, you protect him.

136
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,760
Yes.

137
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,760
He can't die yet.

138
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
Why?

139
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,760
You don't need to know.

140
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,760
Don't you listen to me?

141
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Go.

142
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,760
You taught the Mo's knife skill?

143
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,760
Does he deserve it?

144
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,760
Or you deserve it?

145
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,760
Don't touch him.

146
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,760
You've killed his father.

147
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,760
Isn't that enough?

148
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:53,760
You're the one who led him to kill Prince Jin

149
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,760
with the Mo Junyu's secret weapon, right?

150
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,760
Prince Jin was assassinated

151
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,760
because Mo Junyu was used.

152
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,760
You're the only one who can use Mo Qinglian to kill Mo Junyu.

153
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
You're Mo Qingchuan.

154
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
You're the one.

155
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
Qingchuan.

156
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
Do you know what I am?

157
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
A villain.

158
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,760
A villain.

159
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
A villain.

160
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,760
You're the only one who loves me in this world.

161
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,760
How can I leave the rest?

162
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,760
You can try.

163
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:40,760
I want this one.

164
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
Thank you, boss.

165
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:43,760
Okay.

166
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Go.

167
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,760
Why are you following me?

168
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,760
He wants to eat my sugar gourd.

169
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,760
I'll go to the market.

170
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,760
It's sweet.

171
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,760
You haven't eaten it before.

172
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,760
People here are using some secret medicine

173
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
to train those kids into murder tools.

174
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,760
No wonder.

175
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,760
They've been eating those crazy drugs since they were little.

176
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,760
It must be so bitter.

177
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,760
It's okay.

178
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,760
I'll take care of this sugar gourd.

179
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,760
Here you are.

180
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Tell me what he's been up to these days.

181
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,760
He's been buying food,

182
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:57,700
arguing with the

183
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,700
Your Highness.

184
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,700
This villain has a high martial arts ability,

185
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,700
but he's not very smart.

186
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,700
I'd better go.

187
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,700
I can make up for it.

188
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,700
You?

189
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,700
Mo Qingchuan is very obedient.

190
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,700
Only he can shoot people.

191
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,700
Otherwise,

192
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,700
why do you think I sent him?

193
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,700
What are you talking about?

194
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,700
What?

195
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,700
What is it?

196
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,700
Mo Yuan,

197
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,700
they are enemies.

198
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,700
You can't kiss them.

199
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,700
They are enemies.

200
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,700
We are born with our own true feelings.

201
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,700
We are destined to meet in the opposite.

202
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,700
Who decides the opposite?

203
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,700
Is it you, Your Highness?

204
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,700
Don't call them.

205
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,700
Don't act without permission.

206
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,700
Yes.

207
00:15:58,700 --> 00:15:59,700
The birthday banquet is coming.

208
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,700
If the peace talks are held,

209
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,700
it will be a double-deceleration.

210
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,700
Your Highness,

211
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,700
what is General Qingchuan's opinion

212
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,700
on the marriage?

213
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,700
I'm discussing with him.

214
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,700
You should keep an eye on the birthday banquet.

215
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,700
I always feel that

216
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,700
it's not appropriate

217
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,700
for Grand Commandant Cao to do things.

218
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,700
I understand.

219
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,700
I'll leave now.

220
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,700
Your Highness, I'm here.

221
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,700
Call him in.

222
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,700
Call him in.

223
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:53,700
General Qingchuan,

224
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,700
the rumors are spreading.

225
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,700
I'm afraid that you'll have to marry

226
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,700
even if you don't.

227
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,700
What do you think?

228
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,700
I'll marry you.

229
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,700
I'll marry you.

230
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,700
I'll marry you.

231
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,700
I'll marry you.

232
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:13,700
I'll marry you.

233
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,700
I'll marry you.

234
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,700
I'll marry you.

235
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,700
I'll marry you.

236
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:21,700
I'll marry you.

237
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,700
I'll marry you.

238
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,700
As a woman,

239
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,700
I don't want to make things difficult for you.

240
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,700
But as an Empress Dowager,

241
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,700
if the marriage contract is signed,

242
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,700
can you get the peace?

243
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
But Your Highness,

244
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,700
is that peace

245
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,700
real

246
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,700
or just a dream?

247
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,700
Why are you so clear about it?

248
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,700
Even if you're experienced,

249
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,700
you still don't know the battlefield.

250
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,700
Your enemy is the Yi Clan.

251
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,700
And Wu's enemy is even more terrifying.

252
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
They always wear

253
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,700
the mask of a loyal general.

254
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,700
They only use the sword of the clan

255
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,700
to deal with Wu, a woman.

256
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,700
So I let them choose

257
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,700
whether to die in the Xuanhua

258
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,700
or live quietly.

259
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
So now,

260
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,700
Wu Deyi is no different from them.

261
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,700
Water is clear, then there is no fish.

262
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,700
That's the truth.

263
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,700
I understand what you said.

264
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,700
But I only want to live a simple life.

265
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,700
I, Mo Qingchuan,

266
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
would rather be a horse-drawn soul

267
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:47,700
than be an enemy.

268
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,700
I'm afraid that

269
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,700
I can't be a good wife to you.

270
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,700
I know you care about the people.

271
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,700
But a marriage

272
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,700
is not a way to save the country and the people.

273
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,700
For example,

274
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,700
although I'm very humble,

275
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,700
if I didn't sit on the throne,

276
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,700
I'm afraid that the country will be in chaos.

277
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:10,700
What do you mean?

278
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,700
Actually, you and I

279
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,700
are very similar.

280
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,700
How can I compare with the Empress Dowager?

281
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,700
I can't control the Empress Dowager's decision.

282
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,700
But I can control this life.

283
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
General Mo,

284
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,700
even if you have the ability to understand the heaven,

285
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,700
you are a woman after all.

286
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,700
A woman can't escape from marriage.

287
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,700
If you have a marriage agreement,

288
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,700
I can push this agreement for you.

289
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,700
What a pity!

290
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,700
But don't forget, Empress Dowager.

291
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,700
In the eyes of the people,

292
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,700
I'm a general first,

293
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,700
and then a woman.

294
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,700
Do you have a way

295
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
to stop Feng Shiyi from marrying me?

296
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,700
Yes.

297
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,700
What's the way?

298
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,700
I'll beg the Empress Dowager

299
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,700
to take the position of Prince Jing

300
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,700
and make a deal with the Empress Dowager.

301
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,700
She may be able to allow me to marry...

302
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,700
Prince Jing?

303
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
How can you do that?

304
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,700
What's the way?

305
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,700
The way...

306
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,700
Tell me.

307
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,700
What's the way?

308
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,700
This...

309
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:44,700
Eat.

310
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:50,700
It seems that I can't eat the jade fish today.

311
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,700
Mo Xingchuan

312
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,700
is no hero.

313
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,700
He is beyond the description.

314
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,700
Exactly.

315
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
But Feng Shiyi has already had a child.

316
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,700
Just a piece of crap.

317
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,700
Where are you going?

318
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,700
Master,

319
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,700
they are saying nonsense.

320
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,700
They are right.

321
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,700
They are wrong!

322
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,700
What is wrong?

323
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,700
I was not the one who

324
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,700
endured humiliation and begged for life.

325
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,700
I wasn't the one

326
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,700
My Mixed-Music can 알려 у д Universe Romance

327
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,820
Everything we got ,what we have

328
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,760
Is it our dream to be as makeshift as they said?

329
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,240
It's nothing but a trick

330
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,240
Not something serious

331
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,500
What Vast Dress

332
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,500
You Vermont

333
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,300
What muddy places have never witnessed

334
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,500
and helping me to go Dutch.

335
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,420
I will do the job

336
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:33,860
if the world is

337
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,540
ignorant of you.

338
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,140
I was seriously injured by the rumors.

339
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,820
I, Mo Qingchuan,

340
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,460
did it.

341
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,940
I'm not afraid of anyone's words

342
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,460
or any misdeeds.

343
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,300
I used you to beg the Empress Dowager.

344
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,500
Does it work?

345
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,140
I wonder if it will work

346
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,660
if your father dies and you ask for his life.

347
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:57,060
You're angry.

348
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,420
That's right.

349
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,340
Don't let me hear the word

350
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,900
beg from you again.

351
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,340
Remember,

352
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,460
nothing in this world

353
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,900
is beg.

354
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,140
Not just for others' opinions,

355
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,740
but also for

356
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,380
me, a soldier of Xia,

357
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,540
I can't just watch a weak woman being humiliated.

358
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,900
Weak woman?

359
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:26,860
Who?

360
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,460
Me?

361
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,580
In Qi Guang's eyes,

362
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,580
I'm a woman.

363
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,100
I should be protected.

364
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,220
Xia Qi Guang,

365
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,460
what are you thinking?

366
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:52,660
I want to say...

367
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,780
I want to say

368
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,100
she can help you.

369
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,780
I can do it, too.

370
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:01,700
Yes.

371
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,860
She's despicable and shameless.

372
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:07,420
But she has to give up her evil power to deal with the evil.

373
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,340
Her promise has nothing to do with you.

374
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:11,620
You don't have to

375
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,660
go against the Empress.

376
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,020
I won't let her

377
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,540
get my master's heart.

378
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,300
Heart?

379
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,420
What else do I have?

380
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,060
Master,

381
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,740
trust me this time.

382
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,820
I'll help you get back

383
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,420
what you lost.

384
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,780
If you can't get back,

385
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,900
I'll be your pioneer.

386
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,780
Master went fishing alone.

387
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,220
He insisted on following me.

388
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,940
He's so boring.

389
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,140
How about going to the palace?

390
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:17,620
Who?

391
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:35,220
I agree.

392
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,180
Age,

393
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:57,820
time.

394
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,340
I have so many haties for you.

395
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,940
Show me how to pull one each.

396
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,540
I am a character that makes people's colors of words become very strong.

397
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:13,540
Tang Hulu has already bought it.

398
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,140
She didn't come by herself.

399
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,140
Did you scare her?

400
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,140
It's not a big deal.

401
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:22,340
I'll take it to trick other kids.

402
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,340
Forget it.

403
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:28,140
How is the situation of the two countries' alliance?

404
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,540
What has the Empress Dowager considered?

405
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,740
General Mo is unwilling to marry.

406
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:34,940
Who can make the decision?

407
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,740
It's not enough to avoid three times of the misdeed.

408
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,340
Mo Qingchuan is not an ordinary woman.

409
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:43,740
With General Mo around, the Mo Troop is already around.

410
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,940
I'm afraid that there is no need to make this peace.

411
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,740
If the peace treaty fails,

412
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:52,540
the Empress Dowager will cherish Mo Qingchuan as a woman.

413
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:57,540
The Empress Dowager cherishes Mo Qingchuan as a woman who can protect the country.

414
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:01,540
If she can't get the material that the country needs,

415
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:04,740
I can only trust her.

416
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,340
But...

417
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:16,140
If the two countries' alliance is reduced by 20%,

418
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:21,940
this matter may still have room for a comeback.

419
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,540
Why did the Empress Dowager prefer Juhua?

420
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:37,140
I'm afraid that the two countries' alliance is not enough.

421
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,140
The two countries' alliance is not enough.

422
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,340
You know,

423
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:45,740
it's only on the night that the moment I give you the order...

424
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:48,940
Then you'll be dead, right?

425
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,940
You're right.

426
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,940
Since my great Will met Prince Whoa's condition,

427
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:06,340
this year he almost becomes a king.

428
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,740
I can't let this happen.

429
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:11,100
first- mortar

430
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,540
For three years

431
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,840
Xie Chong

432
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,000
Who is actually the epicenter ofazon?

433
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,940
Jia Qingchuan signed a contract

434
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:47,700
Will be open for three days

435
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:52,000
This time you have to consider seriously
