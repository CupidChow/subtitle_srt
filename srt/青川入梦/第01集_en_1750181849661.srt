I'm afraid I can't see you.

General Qingchuan,

20

think about it.

00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Chu is a better country than the rest of the country.

22
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why do you have to do this?

These big-time troubles

32
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
are also causing trouble.

33
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm so angry.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I heard that the north is full of snow.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Many people are killed.

36
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's getting harder day by day.

37
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Shhh.

38
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Stop fighting.

39
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Please, Your Highness.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The Crown Prince knows he's wrong.

41
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Crown Prince,

42
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
you should admit your mistake.

43
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I'm not good at teaching.

44
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm willing to take the Crown Prince over.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Please spare the Crown Prince.

46
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Bastard.

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You go to the Cao's Mansion and punish me.

48
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You can't go.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You...

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Your Highness,

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Cao Ling'an is taking the Empress Dowager's medicine.

52
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
She's going to fight for the throne tomorrow

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and she's going to marry two women.

54
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
The Crown Prince can't stand it.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Besides,

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
the Crown Prince knows our grudges.

57
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I think the Crown Prince,

58
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
he's done enough.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Qi Guang,

60
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
do you know how much trouble you've caused?

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I know

62
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
that if he doesn't want to fight me,

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll take it.

64
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I won't.

65
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
If I'm guilty,

66
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
it's impossible.

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
How could you be so stubborn?

68
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Your Highness,

69
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
he's new here.

70
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
He broke something.

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
He took it.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Your Highness, thank you.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Go get him.

74
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yes.

75
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Yes.

76
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Go.

77
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Get up.

78
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

79
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Crown Prince.

80
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Your Highness,

81
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
you can go.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yes.

83
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You're a good doctor.

84
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I'm willing to take care of you.

85
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Qi Guang,

86
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
do you know

87
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
why Prince Jing's medicine used to come here?

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I know.

89
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Father has fought with a lot of soldiers.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Not only is he his brother,

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
but also his military officer.

92
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,480
Compared to Xia Yubo,

93
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,760
after Queen Dowager Cao Manning homes Greatune,

94
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,400
but in order to protect her safety and stability...

95
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,360
LEAVE AbSTORM nivel week,

96
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,480
and clear fertile land for privately,

97
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,520
father evaded three measures and invited the harem

98
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,680
He today will be the Star of Fortune.

99
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,640
Then do you know

100
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,560
why you would only stay within Qing лес?

101
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:25,620
Gokazu knows that

102
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,780
I wish to become the next Lord since I am a son of the Wing.

103
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,560
You understand. Why can't youパid up energy?

104
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:56,500
If father's able to endure andWAVE and

105
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,500
I'm afraid that I won't be able to be in peace with Chu Guo Jiang.

106
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,500
I've been thinking about it for three years.

107
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,500
I'm begging you for a master.

108
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
I'll teach you a lesson.

109
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,500
What master?

110
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Of course it's me.

111
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,500
Who is it?

112
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
What master?

113
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,500
Of course it's me.

114
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,500
Who is it?

115
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,500
The shadow of the forest, Jiang Kui.

116
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,500
He is my sword.

117
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,500
The red lotus sky dance.

118
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,500
Let's meet the king.

119
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,500
Master is a golden pepper.

120
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
He is not very good at it.

121
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,500
He is in the Qingxing House in Chenxi.

122
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
He is the king's son.

123
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,500
He is a master.

124
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,500
Jiang Kui?

125
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,500
Is that Jiang Kui?

126
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
That's right.

127
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,500
The legendary Jianghu.

128
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
The famous one who was captured by the Xingyue Sect.

129
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,500
The one who left the Huohai.

130
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,500
He is a man of the world.

131
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
He is sick.

132
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,500
I'm kidding.

133
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,500
I've changed my rules.

134
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,500
See you tomorrow, little junior.

135
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,500
You're finally back.

136
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:29,500
It's great.

137
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
The duel.

138
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,500
Aren't you my graduate?

139
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,500
Prince of Jing.

00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,500
Theàyies般 military必n king.

141
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,000
Sister, don't smash it.

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,900
It's my turn.

143
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,500
Here goes!

144
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,740
No gift for you!

145
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,580
Master!

146
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,220
Someone's here!

147
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,840
Ji Xu.

148
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,240
Don't steal the Qing Kee.

153
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:52,220
Wait up

154
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,380
Ch Hannah is so deep.

Who are you?

158
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,120
It's just that...

159
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,120
Don't torture me!

160
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,120
Why is his breath so strange?

161
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,120
Jiang Kui, listen to me.

162
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,120
Yes!

163
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,120
Master!

164
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,120
Greetings to Mr. Mo.

165
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,120
Good-for-nothing.

166
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,080
You are still here ...

167
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,040
Hit the jar.

168
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:26,540
You I met this ago.

169
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:33,480
After μr. 0, 100 or 1004 would surely be the tapping number of enemies in the group.

170
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,080
Then you can enter the front ghess shallow,

171
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,280
the security architectural specialization room

172
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,880
is missing?

173
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,000
M neutralized about that gradual succession.

174
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
I'm asking you.

175
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Is Mr. Mo a martial arts expert?

176
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
To be honest, it's a bit of a mess.

177
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Mr. Mo, please forgive me.

178
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Qi Guang is only a person who is not good at martial arts.

179
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
I won't lose this time.

180
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
With the size and size of the insides,

181
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
it's critical that he should pray for everybody.

182
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
You should be remain young till 3 am.

183
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I can't help you.

184
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
After the war, I was the payback.

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,000
When Youลi Youth Union invaded our company many times

186
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
we were miejsce with the banks

187
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,000
so I am not more aware of having sneaked into Chu.

188
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I, the Su Yuan,

189
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,000
am like General Mo Qingchuan.

190
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I am a general who fought with soldiers.

191
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
In the end, I am the one who conquered Qingchuan.

192
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Like General Mo Qingchuan?

193
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
So, you also want to be a traitor who sells the country and begs for glory?

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Am I wrong?

195
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Mo Qingchuan is not a traitor.

196
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Twelve years ago,

197
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
when Mo Qingchuan returned to the capital and was conferred as the general of Xianfeng,

198
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I was lucky enough to see him.

199
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
It was Yongping's third year.

200
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
He was the first to go to the battlefield.

201
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
That year, Yongping was the first to leave the capital and go to the capital.

202
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
General Mo was injured and Mo's three sons were taken to war.

203
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It was him.

204
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:58,000
He was single for 15 years and took the enemy's handphone and turned the war around.

205
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Later, he led the Mo's army to the battle.

206
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He was in the battle and was afraid to turn the war around.

207
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
It was him.

208
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Zhang Ping is new.

209
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The war of Chu Xia was resumed again.

210
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Mo Junshan died in the battlefield.

211
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
The Mo's army was all defeated by Mo Junyu.

212
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Mo Qingchuan was taken to the battle of Chuanhe.

213
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
He was a fool.

214
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,000
The enemy was well-known at the time of the war.

215
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Mo Qingchuan was shot down by the arrow.

216
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
A man who was killed by a gunshot.

217
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
A man who was killed by a man outside the capital.

218
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
You said he was a traitor.

219
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
Everyone said he was a traitor.

220
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
But I...

221
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I will never believe it.

222
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
If you see him one day,

223
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
he will tell you personally that he is a traitor.

224
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Xia Qi Guang will answer.

225
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,000
If he is a real traitor...

226
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
He will tell me personally that he is a traitor.

227
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I will never believe it.

228
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I will never believe it.

229
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
You can't say more.

230
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Mr. Mo.

231
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I will never believe it.

232
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I will never believe it.

233
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
What are you doing?

234
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I promised you.

235
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
You can't do it if you don't.

236
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Li Cheng.

237
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I will never do it.

238
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Li Cheng.

239
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I promise you.

240
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I promise you.

241
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Xia Qi Guang will answer.

242
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
If he is a real traitor...

243
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
If he is a real traitor...

244
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,900
falls into the trap of death.

245
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,800
Open the gate.

246
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,700
Go to the temple!

247
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,920
Master, you've made Dream again?

248
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
I dreamed of Qingchuan Town.

249
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I dreamed of it.

250
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,000
How many?

251
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Two.

252
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
It's time to settle the accounts.

253
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
The Prince of Jin will be at the capital.

254
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,000
It's almost there.

255
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
I'm going to the capital.

256
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Lord Jin

257
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Master?

258
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
What do you mean?

259
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The Prince of Jin?

260
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
The Prince of Jin?

261
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The Prince of Jin is gone?

262
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Prepare the horses.

263
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
I'll go to the capital.

264
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Okay.

265
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,240
we will see each other棓宫

266
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,240
Do not speak

267
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,680
You should leave the capital

268
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,600
before it doesn't come any further

269
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,000
We have played the piano in How Qingying for many years

270
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,160
It has been too boy,

271
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:22,360
you might not be here

272
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:24,760
But the way to rest and receive the gold seal

273
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,120
is also a mistake.

274
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,840
This is the gold seal of the Chans' family.

275
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,920
There's a letter

276
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,800
to Mr. Mo.

277
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,360
Yes.

278
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,480
Goodbye.

279
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,160
See you in three years.

280
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,320
Don't worry, Your Highness.

281
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,200
I will take good care of you.

282
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,120
Your Highness!

283
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,200
Your Highness!

284
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:10,120
Father!

285
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,880
Protect His Highness!

286
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,840
Kill Wang Hu!

287
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,760
Here, get off me!

288
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:30,480
Ugh!

289
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,480
What's that noise?

290
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,320
What are you doing?

291
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,320
I'm going to the battlefield.

292
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,320
Zi Hao! Protect the Prince of Jin!

293
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Let's go.

294
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,320
Let's go, Father.

295
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,320
Shi Guang!

296
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,320
Father!

297
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
Father!

298
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,320
Father!

299
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,320
Dong Nan.

300
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,320
Xi Nan.

301
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,320
Father.

302
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,320
Father.

303
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,320
Please.

304
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,320
Please.

305
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,320
Please save my father.

306
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,320
Please.

307
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,320
Please save my father.

308
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,320
Please.

309
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,320
Please.

310
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,320
Master.

311
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,320
Master.

312
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:53,340
consign to

313
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,600
the Fire Immortal

314
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,320
Ye Chenanı.

315
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
What's going on?

316
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,320
Mr. Mo, Yin Chai is dead.

317
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,320
He can't keep the whole world safe.

318
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,320
Get up.

319
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,320
If you dare to fight again, I'll make you suffer.

320
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,320
You're not old enough.

321
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,320
Xia Li was arrested by Dali Temple

322
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,320
because of the murder of Liu's family.

323
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,320
Even Qiu Ji had a death sentence.

324
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,320
Why did you appear here?

325
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,320
You chased the Soul Sword and the Shunt.

326
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
I heard that the recent years

327
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:17,320
have created a mysterious organization called the Locked Door.

328
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,320
You're not hungry.

329
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,320
You came from the Locked Door?

330
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,320
Very good.

331
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,320
How many people have you brought?

332
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,320
I haven't been here in half a year.

333
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
It's a purple bone pill.

334
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,320
I heard that it's made of rock, right?

335
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,320
Open your mouth.

336
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,320
I just gave you a silver.

337
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,320
Guess which one is more powerful?

338
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,320
He and the purple bone pill are made of rock.

339
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,320
Now, tell me all your plans.

340
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,320
I'm very reasonable.

341
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,320
I'll give you a life.

342
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,320
We received an order today.

343
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,320
We said we should eliminate the plan

344
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,320
and then destroy the secret plan

345
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,320
and eliminate the murder of the City of the City.

346
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,320
That's right.

347
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,320
Let's go.

348
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,320
Very good.

349
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,320
Let's go.

350
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,320
Jiang Kun.

351
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
Leave some clues to the court.

352
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,320
Tell them who did it.

353
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
Okay.

354
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,320
How to leave it?

355
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,320
Just do it.

356
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,320
Master, is this okay?

357
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:15,320
I'm not sure.

358
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,320
I'm not sure.

359
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,320
Master, is this okay?

360
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Silver Chanshan.

361
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,320
Yes.

362
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
Put them in the fire.

363
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,320
Burn them.

364
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
Yes.

365
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:49,320
I'm sorry.

366
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,320
I'm sorry.

367
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,320
I'm sorry.

368
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,320
I'm sorry.

369
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:57,320
I'm sorry.

370
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,320
I'm sorry.

371
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:01,320
I'm sorry.

372
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,320
I'm sorry.

373
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,320
I'm sorry.

374
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,320
