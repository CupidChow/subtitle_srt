1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,640
cured

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:36,440
Mo Qingchuan! Mo Qingchuan!

3
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Uncle.

4
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,760
Mo Qingchuan!

5
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:39,440
How is it?

6
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,600
Good niece.

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,400
You're so young and brave.

8
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,240
You lost the Yanwu.

9
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,000
But you're no match for me.

10
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,280
Mo Qingchuan

11
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,120
is the pride of our family.

12
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,640
I'm flattered.

13
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,400
Uncle, I admit it.

14
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,600
Mo Qingchuan! Mo Qingchuan!

15
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,440
I should win at least once.

16
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,600
I can win.

17
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,160
My lord.

18
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:16,760
My lord.

19
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,960
There are many reinforcements.

20
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,400
Many reinforcements?

21
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:21,960
Yes.

22
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,960
But they all went to Wali.

23
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,680
They were killed by our bow and arrow.

24
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:28,160
Only a few.

25
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,920
Fine.

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,920
Kill all here.

27
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,120
Keep one died.

28
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,520
Yes.

29
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,200
four men fight.

30
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,080
Don't fight.

31
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,560
Get back.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Have you heard

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
What's going on?

34
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
What's going on?

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
They're attacking us.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Don't care about it.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Kill them.

38
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Kill them.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Kill them.

40
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Kill them.

41
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Kill them.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Kill them.

43
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Kill them.

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Kill them.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Kill them.

46
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Kill them.

47
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Kill them.

48
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Kill them.

49
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Kill them.

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Why is there no sound?

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
The enemy must have more than ten people.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
We've been fooled.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Kill them.

54
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Kill them.

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Kill them.

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Kill them.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Sir.

58
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Sir.

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
The enemy is coming this way.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
What did you say?

61
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The enemy has come here.

62
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
We've been injured.

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Many of them were scared away.

64
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
How many of them are here?

65
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We don't know.

66
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We have no idea how many of them are here.

67
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
They are everywhere.

68
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
If we get caught,

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
we're in a dead end.

70
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Sir,

71
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
we'd better run away.

72
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Don't run.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Don't run.

74
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Don't run.

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
No way.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
We must run.

77
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
It's impossible.

78
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,480
My lord, if you're found in the mountain,

79
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,240
you'll be in trouble.

80
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,360
It's important to save your life.

81
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,560
I'll leave first.

82
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,760
Mo Qingchuan.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,400
The imperial bodyguard is climbing the mountain at this time.

84
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,200
Is he out to practice?

85
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,880
I heard that Xia Qigong

86
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,960
destroyed the Cloud Fog Camp on the mountain last night.

87
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,400
What's strange is

88
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,880
that the camp is not a normal camp.

89
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,480
There are two thousand soldiers there.

90
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,360
Why does the imperial bodyguard look so bad?

91
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,280
Are these soldiers

92
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,360
the soldiers

93
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,720
that the imperial bodyguard raised privately?

94
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,760
It's none of my business.

95
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,400
Don't talk nonsense.

96
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,680
The general of the Mo family who was captured

97
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,600
is now in a bad state

98
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,160
for twenty enemies.

99
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,720
You are really a useless soldier.

100
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,360
Twenty people?

101
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,160
Twenty people.

102
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,320
You...

103
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:02,880
Mo Qingchuan.

104
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,200
You're so mean.

105
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,160
Compared with the fact that you killed

106
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,520
tens of thousands of soldiers,

107
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,280
it's nothing.

108
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,880
You...

109
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,440
Mo Junyu.

110
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,680
Those dead people

111
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,280
are crossing the desert and the mountain at this moment.

112
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,560
Their souls are in the valley

113
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,320
and are around you.

114
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,720
Did you hear that?

115
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,120
Hear what?

116
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:42,640
Hear the breath of the dead.

117
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,480
They are looking at you.

118
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,000
This time,

119
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,240
they will witness your death

120
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,760
as if you were in the dead end of the world.

121
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,600
Death.

122
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,160
I won't see you off.

123
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,080
You...

124
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,640
Let me go.

125
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,720
There's a underground cell

126
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,080
in the mountain village.

127
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,920
Who's locked up in there?

128
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,120
Go.

129
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,280
You are Mo Qinglian?

130
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,160
The whole plan is like this.

131
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,080
But if he chooses to transfer you,

132
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,120
he will kill you.

133
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,240
Take this medicine

134
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,920
to help you recover your inner power.

135
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,000
And,

136
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,440
do you remember how you broke the small stone?

137
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,880
Yes.

138
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,160
Let's go down the mountain and have a rest.

139
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,720
Yes.

140
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,880
I'm Mo Qinglian.

141
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,560
Mo Qinglian?

142
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,880
Didn't he get killed by Chu Jun?

143
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,400
Is that Mo Qinglian?

144
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,480
He looks a bit like him.

145
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,840
Is he really Mo Qinglian?

146
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,680
Isn't he the one who died in Qingchuan?

147
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,680
The man wasn't sent to Luying Hall.

148
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,600
He's gone.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,960
Gone?

150
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,200
Where could he go?

151
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,240
He was kidnapped by Mo Qingchuan.

152
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,000
Go find him.

153
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,200
Go find him.

154
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,560
Go find him now.

155
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,600
Go find him now.

156
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,480
Master.

157
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,600
Master.

158
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,320
Master.

159
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,920
It's a big news.

160
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,520
Young Master is still alive.

161
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,120
Many people saw it.

162
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,960
He rode his horse to pass the emergency room

163
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,560
and came to the Imperial Grand Commandant's Mansion.

164
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,080
The Imperial Grand Commandant's Mansion

165
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,960
Father.

166
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:46,720
Mother.

167
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,640
I'm back.

168
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,680
Mo Qinglian is back.

169
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,680
Qingchuan.

170
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,600
You're back too.

171
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,960
Uncle Zhou.

172
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,480
Should I call you Master Zhou

173
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,480
or Zhou Tingwen?

174
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,680
Call me Zhou Zheng.

175
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,560
I bought the soybean glutinous rice cake from Li's.

176
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,800
And the braised beef from Huangji.

177
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,000
I bought the soybean glutinous rice cake from Li's.

178
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,800
I bought the soybean glutinous rice cake from Huangji.

179
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,560
And the braised beef from Huangji.

180
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,040
Let's eat together.

181
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,000
Okay.

182
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,760
Zhou Zheng.

183
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,600
Thank you for taking care of my mother for me these years.

184
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,800
It's my duty.

185
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,240
The old general treated me well.

186
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,840
But I can't figure out

187
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,680
why you hid the truth from Mo Junyu.

188
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,040
It's because of him.

189
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,840
You love him deeply.

190
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,120
But maybe he never cared about you.

191
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,040
Do you know that?

192
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,520
I know.

193
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,800
I know that Mo Junyu is not a good match for him.

194
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,160
But Mo Junyu committed such a serious crime.

195
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,520
He still has the same responsibility.

196
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,960
What I can do is

197
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,720
to keep him safe.

198
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:29,600
Zhou Zheng.

199
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,440
You're different from others.

200
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:34,000
You love the people and care for them.

201
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,640
You should be obedient and be a stable person.

202
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,720
But is it worth it

203
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,000
to be so cruel?

204
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,000
Maybe

205
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,640
he will be scolded by thousands of people.

206
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,120
But I will only wish

207
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,720
he would be happy.

208
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,960
So you won't give me the real Qingchuan War Report,

209
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,320
right?

210
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,880
Thank you.

211
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,360
Thank you for giving me the chance to confess.

212
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,480
I was too selfish.

213
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,120
I didn't cherish it.

214
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,320
You're as good as a stone.

215
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,320
You're a good person.

216
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,720
You're a good person.

217
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,120
You're a good person.

218
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,680
You're a good person.

219
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,760
You're a good person.

220
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,000
Let's go to Wenzi Palace then.

221
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:44,960
Zhou Zheng.

222
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,240
But I didn't give you

223
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,640
the chance to confess

224
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,560
but you offered it to the innocent people on your back.

225
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,080
Mo Junyu.

226
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,920
Mo Junyu is not her child.

227
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,200
the sharp knife in your hand.

228
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,120
The Empress Dowager

229
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,280
only cares if the knife can kill people

230
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,440
and doesn't care if the knife is dirty or not.

231
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,520
As long as the Empress Dowager wants to protect her,

232
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,320
you can't move at all.

233
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:24,480
After all,

234
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,760
Mo Qingchuan

235
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,840
will never use the Empress Dowager's knife.

236
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,960
Qingchuan,

237
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,600
you must be careful.

238
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,640
I'll be careful.

239
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,440
Thank you for your reminder, Lord Zhou.

240
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,960
Then I'll remind you one more time.

241
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,520
Lord Zhou only wants one person to be happy.

242
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,560
But you're not him.

243
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,640
How do you know he's happy?

244
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,480
I didn't expect

245
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,400
that there are two thousand Han bandits

246
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:13,400
in this small Yunwu Village.

247
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,520
And the drawing of military supplies is wrong.

248
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,960
If it wasn't for the help of the owner of the Chanzi House, Mo Wang,

249
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,280
who said he knew the terrain,

250
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,520
it would be very difficult to predict this trip.

251
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,120
Mo Wang?

252
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,320
Yes.

253
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,320
But the Empress Dowager's birthday gift has been returned.

254
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,080
The Yunwu Village's Wuhou curse

255
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,520
has been collected.

256
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,080
Please check it, Empress Dowager.

257
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,520
In order to help Wu get the birthday gift back,

258
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:37,760
the Crown Prince must have been very hard on him.

259
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,360
He will be rewarded very much in the future.

260
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:41,800
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

261
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,400
But I have a doubt.

262
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,240
Why did you only take ten people

263
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,160
to the bandits?

264
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,320
It's fine to be scolded.

265
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,080
If something happens to you,

266
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,320
how will the people of the world treat Wu?

267
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,320
General Cao is here.

268
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,640
Empress Dowager, please calm down.

269
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,200
The bandits in Yunwu Village are all responsible for this.

270
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,360
Please listen to me, Empress Dowager.

271
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,120
A few days ago,

272
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,840
Gao Jiaowei lost the battle with the Crown Prince.

273
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:19,760
So he suggested that

274
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,040
the Crown Prince is very skilled in martial arts.

275
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,040
Ten people are enough to be the bandits.

276
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,560
I didn't expect that

277
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,440
there were so many bandits in Yunwu Village.

278
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,640
It almost killed the Crown Prince.

279
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,560
Now I think about it.

280
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,880
Gao Jiaowei is the one who

281
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,240
conspired against the bandits.

282
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,160
Yes.

283
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,440
But I didn't do it.

284
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,880
If I did,

285
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,760
I wouldn't have followed the Crown Prince

286
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,680
and set the trap.

287
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,720
You are reckless.

288
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,680
I am guilty.

289
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,680
Empress Dowager,

290
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,920
he died with me.

291
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,400
On the battlefield,

292
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,840
we all ran together without being separated.

293
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,120
Please forgive me, Empress Dowager.

294
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,920
Get up.

295
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

296
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:18,280
You are filial, benevolent and determined.

297
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,880
It's really rare.

298
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:22,440
Empress Dowager,

299
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,960
Qi Guang has something strange to report.

300
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,720
We found a man in the mountain

301
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,720
who looked like the son of the Crown Prince,

302
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,560
Mo Qinglian.

303
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:35,840
What?

304
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:37,880
I don't know.

305
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,320
So it's true?

306
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,480
Yes, we saw it with our own eyes.

307
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,360
Where is he now?

308
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:50,880
I'm ashamed to say this,

309
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:54,560
I intended to bring him to Poland

310
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,800
for confirmation.

311
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,600
But don't begin to witness this with me.

312
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:58,960
I was beaten into Byuan.

313
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,640
They were both nowhere to be seen.

314
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,180
but now you're right infront of me.

315
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:35,320
You're back.

316
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:37,800
I'm back.

317
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,160
Master,

318
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,520
are you waiting for me?

319
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:45,960
Yes.

320
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,360
I'm waiting for you.

321
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,560
Qi Guang,

322
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,520
do you know what Mo Qinglian's appearance

323
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,200
means?

324
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,360
It means

325
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,040
Mo Junyu's mask

326
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,240
will be revealed.

327
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,480
What else?

328
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,400
It means

329
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,960
the truth of the battle of Qingchuan

330
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,760
will be revealed.

331
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,040
What else?

332
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:27,680
Nothing.

333
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,880
An Ashen Harem

334
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,480
Master, let me have the medicine.

335
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,760
Farewell.

336
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,000
It means

337
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,920
I, Mo Qingchuan

338
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,040
should come back in front of the world.

339
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,280
Father

340
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:33,500
Didn't you already know?

341
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,280
I ...

342
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:39,760
Yes

343
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,100
Yes, I know

344
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,320
Come in.

345
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:44,840
Wait.

346
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,800
What are you pretending to do?

347
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,240
I...

348
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,440
It's okay.

349
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:57,840
No need to know.

350
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,200
Master.

351
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,600
Master, could you meet him

352
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,360
when we first first met?

353
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,920
You once asked me about something.

354
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,440
If one day you see him

355
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,960
I'll tell you that he betrayed me.

356
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,200
Xia Qigong, answer me.

357
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,960
If he really betrayed me...

358
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,080
I've been waiting.

359
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,640
When Mo Qingchuan

360
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,560
is willing to come back,

361
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,000
I'll answer you again.

362
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,320
I want to tell Master

363
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,080
and Mo Qingchuan

364
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,080
that he betrayed me.

365
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,200
It's not his fault.

366
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:54,160
I'll never change

367
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,480
what I want.

368
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,840
The moon is beautiful tonight.

369
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,600
I'll teach you

370
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:16,880
to break the three worlds.

371
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,280
Master.

372
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,560
The prescription is still useful.

373
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,560
Don't worry.

374
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,680
It's dirty.

375
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,160
Go clean it up.

376
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:35,480
Okay.

377
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,640
The third world

378
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,120
is the most difficult one.

379
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,720
The height is like a tornado.

380
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,920
It's very difficult to break.

381
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,920
It's like a river crossing the sea.

382
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,320
It's like a river

383
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,560
that flows through the sea.

384
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,880
It's like a river

385
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,280
that flows through the sea.

386
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,640
If you want to break the three worlds,

387
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,920
you need to train your inner strength.

388
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,560
Yes, Master.

389
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:12,800
Come on.

390
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:13,920
sell me a book.

391
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,920
I'm ready to go to the battlefield

392
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,920
I'm ready to be the horse that never stops

393
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,920
I'm ready to be the king of the world

394
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,920
I'm ready to be the king of the world

395
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:59,920
I'm ready to be the king of the world

396
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,920
Someone is dead

397
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,920
Let's go

398
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,920
So bad

399
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,920
I'm scared

400
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,920
Let's go

401
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,920
The world is long and the moon is long

402
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,920
Tonight, the tears are rolling down

403
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,920
The moon is like a warehouse

404
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,920
That year, the moon turned around and returned to the beginning

405
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:06,920
The cold frost of winter night is a home that can't be returned

406
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:09,920
The life and death are forgotten

407
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:14,920
The dust is like a dream

408
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:22,920
The young phoenix and the golden horse are saying goodbye to the morning

409
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,920
The world is long and the moon is long

410
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:30,920
The words are like light

411
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,920
The sky is bright and the moon is dim

412
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,920
The world is long and the moon is dim
