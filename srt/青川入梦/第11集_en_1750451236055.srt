00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,040
The embarking of a new chapter

4
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,020
In Seoul's own

5
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,880
Founding the true love

00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:19,640
General Mo

8
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,960

13
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,320
Even my son is dead,

14
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I will not defend our country

15
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,120
even the ones

16
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,500
who messing with our country.

17
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,640
We could hunting watches

18
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,280
so we can live.

19
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,400
We can't escape even being dead.

20
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,240
My fi says, Xi is fat.

21
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,560
Soo that's ...

22
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,960
Shun wei.

23
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,360
Shun wei.

24
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,960
My Shinyss,

25
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,840
Shun wei,

26
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,560
Shun wei!

27
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,840
Some people look unfaithful,

28
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,840
were surgested upon by me,

29
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,240
切犬至小 Mistress Mother.

30
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,640
I've called on the Empress Dowager.

31
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,960
Hm.

32
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,720
Mo QingTom is captured in the Wall of Shans Company.

33
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,880
and your eyes.

34
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,680
Did you see it wrong?

35
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,240
I've been like this for years.

36
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,840
I've been like this for years.

37
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,880
I've been wrong.

38
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,520
I've been trying it for a long time.

39
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,240
I'll ask you again.

40
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,040
Is the person who appeared yesterday

41
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,120
Qinglian?

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Qinglian?

43
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,720
Father.

44
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
Mother.

45
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,960
I'm back.

46
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,520
I want to ask you, father.

47
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,320
Why do you keep me in your care for years?

48
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,920
I want to ask you

49
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,120
why do you keep me in your care for years?

50
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,240
But I don't dare to say it.

51
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,240
Qinglian.

52
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,240
I don't dare to say it.

53
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,840
I don't dare to say it.

54
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,840
Qinglian.

55
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,400
I am a father who protects the hero.

56
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,320
He's scared in his heart.

57
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,400
People know

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,520
he's a traitor

59
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,880
in order to guard the Mo family!

60
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,520
He's beaten yearning to be a traitor

61
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,880
both in the State of Chu and in other regions!

62
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,240
I will save you.

63
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,240
You are served by the enemy.

64
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,240
I am here to save you.

65
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,240
I will die for you.

66
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,240
Guards!

67
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
What are you doing?

68
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
I don't allow you to touch her.

69
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,240
If you want her to live, then shut up.

70
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,240
Qinglian hasn't come back.

71
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,240
This person is just a fool who is in a hurry.

72
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,240
Arrest him!

73
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,240
Let go of my child!

74
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,240
Let go of him!

75
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
Hide him well.

76
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,240
Yes.

77
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:09,240
I don't want you to hurt him.

78
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Let go of my child!

79
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,240
Let go of him!

80
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,240
Go!

81
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,240
Qinglian!

82
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
I promise you.

83
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,240
When the phoenix is gone,

84
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
I will send Qinglian out of the capital.

85
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,240
You and I have been like a palace.

86
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240
I will not let you go.

87
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Qinglian

88
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,240
has died long ago.

89
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,240
You retreated to Liya Town.

90
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:02,240
You didn't go to the battle at all.

91
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,240
You were angry with Chu.

92
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,240
You changed your body.

93
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,240
You were a fan.

94
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
You were so loyal to the army.

95
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,240
You finally protected Liya Town.

96
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,240
You said that you were the death of Qinglian.

97
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,240
You fulfilled your great mission.

98
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,240
But if Qinglian is re-emerged today,

99
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,240
then everything I said

100
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,240
has become a fake.

101
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,240
You can even say that you are the one who changed the deal

102
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,240
with Di An Tong.

103
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,240
I will never ask you the last question.

104
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,240
Mo Qinglian

105
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,240
has Mo Qinglian come back?

106
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,240
It's the wrong person.

107
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,240
This is the crime of the traitor.

108
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,240
It will not only lead to Yan'er.

109
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
If this is a conspiracy,

110
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,240
it will lead to the Cao's death.

111
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,240
Qianlian will be killed.

112
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,240
You will be killed by Mo Shun at that time.

113
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,240
It's the best if you make a mistake.

114
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,240
I understand.

115
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,240
I will never betray Empress Dowager.

116
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,240
Tell her again.

117
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,240
She is gone.

118
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,240
I will go back to the army.

119
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Who is it?

120
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,240
It's me, Zhou Zheng.

121
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:40,240
I have to tell you something.

122
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,240
I will leave if you don't tell me.

123
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,240
It's important to keep this matter in mind.

124
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,240
I dare not tell Empress Dowager the truth.

125
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,240
But it's a mess.

126
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,240
I can't control it.

127
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,240
Moreover,

128
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,240
you should know how Qinglian came back.

129
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,240
Mo Qingchuan?

130
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,240
She will never let this matter happen.

131
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,240
She is in the sea.

132
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,240
She wants Qinglian to be the emperor.

133
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,240
She wants to make a scene in the scene.

134
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,240
It's also a reason.

135
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,240
She is forcing you and Empress Dowager to make a choice.

136
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
In Mo Junyu and Mo Qinglian,

137
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,240
the second choice is the first.

138
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,240
This is a serious matter.

139
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,240
Empress Dowager will never let this matter happen.

140
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,240
So Mo Junyu...

141
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,240
He...

142
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,240
He may kill Qinglian.

143
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,240
Please protect yourself.

144
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,240
Zhou Zheng.

145
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,240
Can you take me away?

146
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,240
Who is it?

147
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,240
I just want to leave you alone.

148
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,240
Why are you here?

149
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,240
Who are you?

150
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
I'm the master of the Feng family.

151
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
Moreover,

152
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,240
Mo Qinglian is locked in...

153
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,240
the courtyard of the Luo Ying Palace.

154
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Come on, get ready.

155
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
It seems that...

156
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,240
I can only leave you alone.

157
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,240
Zhou Zheng, you should hide.

158
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,240
Then you should hide well.

159
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:14,240
You should hide the one around you.

160
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,240
This...

161
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,240
Then how can I...

162
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,240
See you later.

163
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,240
You really left?

164
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,240
Madam.

165
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,240
I'm here to see you.

166
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,240
Mo Junyu left the house.

167
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,240
Cao Yu Yan went to find Cao Huai Tai.

168
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,240
He also went to the Luo Ying Palace to feel the resentment.

169
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
The smell of this road...

170
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,240
is like a moth's mouth.

171
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,240
The way I walk slowly...

172
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,240
is very delicate.

173
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,240
Yes.

174
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,240
I'm sorry.

175
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
I'm sorry.

176
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,240
I'm sorry.

177
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,240
I'm sorry.

178
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,240
I'm sorry.

179
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,240
Yes.

180
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,240
Who is it?

181
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Is it...

182
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,240
my father?

183
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,240
Is he here to give me life?

184
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,240
Uncle Jun Shan told me...

185
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,240
that Mo Jun's business...

186
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,240
is not good enough.

187
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
At that time...

188
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,240
I was a member of the Mo Jun Army.

189
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
Sister Qingchuan also praised me for being a good father.

190
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,240
I also practiced martial arts when I was young.

191
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,240
I wanted to fight for the Mo family.

192
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,240
But then...

193
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
I knew the truth.

194
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,240
Father.

195
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,240
You have been a traitor.

196
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,240
I was in a dilemma.

197
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,240
I wanted to change for you.

198
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,240
I told myself...

199
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,240
that you just wanted me to live.

200
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,240
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,240
But I didn't want to...

202
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,240
I didn't want to.

203
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,240
But I was so ashamed...

204
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,240
to think that...

205
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,240
I still hoped...

206
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,240
that you could go back...

207
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,240
and never kill me.

208
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,240
Right?

209
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,240
Go.

210
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,240
It's really you.

211
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
I...

212
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,240
I'm sorry.

213
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,240
I want to...

214
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,240
keep you company.

215
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,240
I...

216
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,240
I...

217
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,240
I...

218
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,240
Uncle.

219
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,240
Please kill my son's murderer...

220
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,240
at the scene.

221
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,240
Two pieces of dust.

222
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,240
It's time to say goodbye to the devil.

223
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
If the heart is like a cloud,

224
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,240
the obsession is like water.

225
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
The world is like a cloud.

226
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,240
The world is like a cloud.

227
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,240
The world is like a cloud.

228
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,240
The world is like a cloud.

229
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
The world is like a cloud.

230
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,240
The world is like a cloud.

231
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:29,240
The world is like a cloud.

232
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,240
The world is like a cloud.

233
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,840
The world is like a cloud.

234
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,240
The world is like a cloud.

235
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,240
The world is like a cloud.

236
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,240
The world is like a cloud.

237
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,240
The world is like a cloud.

238
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,240
The world is like a cloud.

239
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,240
Tell the truth.

240
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,240
Why haven't you rested yet?

241
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,240
You rested early today.

242
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,240
You came here earlier than usual.

243
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,240
What happened?

244
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,240
General Cao received your niece's help today.

245
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,240
Someone was trying to harm her.

246
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,240
She went to catch the thief.

247
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,240
But she was hit by...

248
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:13,240
Mo Taiwei's assassin, Mo Qinglian.

249
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,240
Chen Siqi.

250
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,240
Zhou Zheng.

251
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,240
Mo Junyu.

252
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,240
And...

253
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:34,240
Empress Dowager Cao.

254
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,420
Your daughter is trying to catch Can Gu with the10 servings.

255
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:06,220
Empress Dowager Cao is on the front,

256
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:14,140
Miss See

257
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,460
Like the higher ground,

258
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,780
the higher higher.

259
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,700
Let's stay until the anemone goes.

260
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,580
Not like Tao is out in the room.

261
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,500
No one will come to fight let alone ouraggio.

262
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,500
Master,

263
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,220
soon we will know

264
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,300
who themekate is.

265
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:41,100
Get him out,

266
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,700
without me

267
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,140
The last time,

268
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,140
people

269
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,300
always regret the fact that Mo Jie

270
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,140
was the one who made it.

271
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,140
Enough!

272
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,140
Mo Junyu,

273
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,140
you are so good to Lian'er.

274
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:01,140
You are so good to the poison.

275
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,140
I really want to see your new flower.

276
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,140
I don't know what happened to me.

277
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,140
I'm sorry, Jing Lian.

278
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,140
I'm sorry to you.

279
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,140
You are right.

280
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,140
It was my fault.

281
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,140
It was my blind blindness.

282
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:29,140
I had to beg for aunt's death.

283
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,140
But you

284
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,140
never gave me a chance to think about it.

285
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,140
You even

286
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,140
despised me, right?

287
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,140
I...

288
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,140
You marry me

289
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,140
just for the sake of the future.

290
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,140
I was the one who made it.

291
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,140
It's time to wake up.

292
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,140
No.

293
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,140
No.

294
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,140
No.

295
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,140
Of course not.

296
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,140
You were like a bloodshed.

297
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,140
But I didn't have a sword.

298
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,140
Everything I did

299
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,140
was for the sake of

300
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,140
your wife, Ai Banzhen.

301
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:14,140
You said

302
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,140
I was the one who made it.

303
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,140
I remember it.

304
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,140
Now you are saying this

305
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,140
is too late.

306
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,140
It's not late.

307
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,140
Of course not.

308
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,140
If you help me and Zhou Zhengqiu

309
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,140
as long as he doesn't change his mind,

310
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,140
and doesn't give up the path of Qingchuan,

311
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,140
we still have a chance to return to the place.

312
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:37,140
We can start over.

313
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,140
You want me to beg him again?

314
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,140
Yan'er.

315
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,140
As long as I pass this southern pass,

316
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,140
I will take good care of you

317
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,140
and Li'er.

318
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,140
Okay?

319
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,140
Yan'er.

320
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,140
Yan'er.

321
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,140
Poor girl.

322
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,140
I know you are in pain.

323
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,140
Mo Junyu committed a grave crime.

324
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,140
As her wife,

325
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,140
you will be implicated.

326
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,140
Don't worry.

327
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,140
I won't let you get involved.

328
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,140
Thank you, aunt.

329
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,140
But

330
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,140
she committed a grave crime.

331
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:29,140
But since you two got married,

332
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,140
you have been loving her.

333
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,140
She has been so kind to us.

334
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,140
She has been so kind to us.

335
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,140
Other than that,

336
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:42,140
she is still reliable.

337
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:47,140
We are like a couple in the same family.

338
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,140
Even if you are wronged,

339
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:53,140
you will be in the same family.

340
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,140
Do you understand?

341
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,140
We are like a couple in the same family.

342
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,140
Okay.

343
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,140
I will go in and take a look at her.

344
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:09,140
You can go back and rest.

345
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,140
Yes, aunt.

346
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,140
Thank you for your help.

347
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:40,140
I am not busy.

348
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,140
You...

349
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,140
Did you tell me

350
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:49,140
whether you have something to do with me?

351
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,140
I...

352
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,140
I...

353
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:52,140
I...

354
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,140
I...

355
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,140
I...

356
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,140
I...

357
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,140
I...

358
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,140
I...

359
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,140
I...

360
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,140
I...

361
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,140
I...

362
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,140
I...

363
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,140
I...

364
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,140
I...

365
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,140
I...

366
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,140
I...

367
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,140
I will.

368
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,140
Do you have anything to tell me?

369
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,140
He's happy now.

370
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:39,860
Zhou Cheng.

371
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,100
Can I beg you for a favor?

372
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,700
A few days ago,

373
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,620
Mo Jun and his son Mo Qinglian were killed.

374
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,220
It's a clear sight.

375
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,300
So, the Crown Prince received a lot of talks and war.

376
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,660
He took part in the battle against the enemy

377
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,620
of the Crown Prince of Yi State.

378
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:11,980
Today,

379
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:12,780
Lord Mo,

380
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,620
do you have anything to say to this?

381
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,340
Your Majesty.

382
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,940
Yan'er has promised me

383
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,900
that Zhou Zheng won't betray me.

384
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,420
As long as I don't kill him,

385
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,900
even if I'm not in the battle with him,

386
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,700
even if Mo Qingchuan is out of the army,

387
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,180
I can't do anything.

388
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,100
Your Majesty.

389
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,780
If Mo Qingchuan returns,

390
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,580
he'll be in the army.

391
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,260
It'll be hard for him

392
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,540
to control the army again.

393
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,260
Right?

394
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,340
Your Majesty.

395
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,820
Your Majesty.

396
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,780
I beg you.

397
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:20,840
même Mt Zhong

398
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,020
Ma Pot Monk's daughter,

399
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,900
no one can do this to her.

400
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,300
Don't worry,

401
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:32,300
I was sent back by Chu army

402
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:35,300
when I was dead.

403
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:39,300
I was so mad at Qing Lian.

404
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:43,300
I didn't know how she fell into the trap.

405
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,300
As for the move,

406
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:49,300
she was so agitated.

407
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,300
I wanted to teach her a lesson.

408
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,300
She didn't kill anyone.

409
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,300
She didn't kill anyone.

410
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,300
Send me Qing Lian.

411
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,300
Send me Qing Lian.

412
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,300
Mo Qing Lian, who are you looking for these years?

413
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,300
Why did Mo Jun hurt you?

414
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:19,300
Just come at once.

415
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:23,300
You are so old and old.

416
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,300
Qing Lian,

417
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,300
do you want to frame your father

418
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:32,300
in front of the outsiders?

419
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,800
Since young, your career has been

420
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,300
taught by me.

421
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:47,300
Can you pay the debt?

422
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:52,300
Pay the debt? Do you deserve it?

423
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:56,300
Yes.

424
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,300
Yan Er, what are you doing here?

425
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,300
Father, Cao Yu Yan and Mo Jun Yu

426
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,300
have met each other before.

427
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:14,300
Today, we will ask for a divorce from you.

428
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,300
What did you say?

429
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,300
Lian Er, you don't owe anyone.

430
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:26,300
Today, I will do my best

431
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:30,300
to help you.

432
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,300
The world is in chaos.

433
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:39,300
I will kill the Chu people

434
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,300
in the battle of Qing Chuan.

435
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,300
I don't know

436
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,300
if Li Yazhen is involved

437
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,300
or not.

438
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,300
But he is the one who made

439
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:51,300
the show for the general.

440
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,300
Yes, he is.

441
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:55,300
Because of the competition,

442
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,300
I was taken by my parents

443
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,300
and secretly went to the next country

444
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,300
and locked in the Cloud Mountain for five years.

445
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,300
I don't see the world.

446
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,300
Sister, is this true?

447
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,300
Go away.

448
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,300
You are so ridiculous.

449
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,300
You have been so desperate

450
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,300
to get rid of me.

451
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:22,300
You want to destroy me?

452
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,300
I have been so desperate to get rid of you.

453
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,300
Mo Jun Yu,

454
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,300
you are just a pitiful fellow

455
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,300
who is living in Mo Jun Mountain

456
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,300
and Mo Qing Chuan.

457
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:36,300
And I, Cao Yu Yan,

458
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,300
was born in the family of the Crown Prince

459
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,300
and the niece of the Empress Dowager

460
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,300
and the daughter of the high-ranking daughter

461
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,300
of the person I know.

462
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:50,300
This is what I know, Cao Yu Yan.

463
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,300
Cao Yu Yan?

464
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,300
What are you talking about?

465
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,300
Enough.

466
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,300
This is the court.

467
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,300
It's not a place for you to argue.

468
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,300
You,

469
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:08,300
apart from Mo Qing Lian,

470
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,300
are there any other evidence?

471
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,300
No.

472
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,300
So it's just a year ago.

473
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,300
The court is so cruel.

474
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,300
How could it be?

475
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,300
All these years,

476
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,300
I have been helping Mo Jun Yu

477
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,300
to cover the truth about the war in Qing Chuan.

478
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,300
All these years,

479
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,300
I was wrong.

480
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,300
I, Zhou Zheng,

481
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,300
am guilty.

482
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,300
Can I beg you for one thing?

483
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,300
Tomorrow,

484
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,300
I will ask you

485
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:16,300
to tell the truth about the war in Qing Chuan.

486
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:19,300
I will tell the truth.

487
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:29,300
You are so stupid.

488
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,300
So he is like this.

489
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:34,300
I am the general of Mo Jun Mountain,

490
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,300
the head of the Mo family.

491
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,300
In the war in Qing Chuan,

492
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,300
my army has set a plan.

493
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,300
To attack Yang Palace,

494
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,300
General Mo Qing Chuan

495
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,300
led the army to the enemy's back.

496
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,300
I will take the capital.

497
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,300
I will guard the war in Qing Chuan.

498
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,300
I will take the enemy to the enemy's back.

499
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:56,300
I will chase them out of the city.

500
00:30:57,300 --> 00:31:00,300
But when General Mo Qing Chuan left the city,

501
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,300
Chu army,

502
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,300
went around the most weak west.

503
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,300
They have known

504
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,300
the power of the army.

505
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,300
Otherwise,

506
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:13,300
the war in Qing Chuan would not be so easy.

507
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,300
I used your good way back then.

508
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:21,300
I wanted to report to the army

509
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,300
to reveal the war and the city's map.

510
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,300
But General Mo

511
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,300
told me to stop.

512
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,300
In the end,

513
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,300
I still followed him.

514
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,300
I changed the path.

515
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:38,300
I covered up the map.

516
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,300
I became the general.

517
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,300
I killed General Mo Qing Chuan.

518
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,300
I became the traitor.

519
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,300
It's true.

520
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,300
There is no such thing.

521
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,300
In the future,

522
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,300
General Mo Qing Chuan, Chen Siqi,

523
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,300
will also take the right to do this.

524
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:58,300
Then, I will make the decision.

525
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:02,300
Even if you decide to stop,

526
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,300
and you decide to stop,

527
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,300
it's me.

528
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,300
I am not a traitor.

529
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,300
Since I was a child,

530
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,300
I have been the son of General Mo.

531
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,300
I want to win over everyone.

532
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,300
I want to win over everyone.

533
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:40,300
As the general of the Mo family,

534
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,300
I risked my life

535
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,300
to protect Li Yazhen

536
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,300
and protect the people.

537
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,300
This arrow

538
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,300
almost killed me.

539
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,300
But you...

540
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,300
You

541
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,300
are a weak and weak scholar.

542
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,300
You

543
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:11,300
are a woman who only knows how to swallow water and powder.

544
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,300
How can you

545
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,300
question my judgment?

546
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:21,300
How can you?

547
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:28,300
I really don't have the right to question you.

548
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,300
But I

549
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,300
just want to remind you of one thing.

550
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:41,300
Back then, Chu army attacked Qing Chuan Town

551
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,300
and killed Qiang Yue.

552
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,300
At the sight of it,

553
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,300
they wanted to break through Yun Qi Mountain

554
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:50,300
and take Li Yazhen.

555
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:52,300
They even sent Qing Lian's corpse

556
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,300
to the city to be tested.

557
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:56,300
We were in the dead of night.

558
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,300
But suddenly,

559
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,300
the army started to retreat.

560
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,300
But after a long time,

561
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,300
the two forces started to talk.

562
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:06,300
My lord,

563
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,300
don't you think it's ridiculous?

564
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,300
Could it be that

565
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:13,300
my army's strategy was failed?

566
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,300
I guess

567
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,300
it's General Mo Qingchuan

568
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,300
who led 800 elite soldiers

569
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,300
to the enemy's rear

570
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,300
to attack Qi.

571
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,300
The most important thing is

572
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:34,300
Chu army had to retreat.

573
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,300
Yes, you're right.

574
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:49,300
I'm guilty of being blind.

575
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,300
I'm guilty of being a member of the Mo's army.

576
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:54,300
I'm guilty of being a member of the Qingchuan people.

577
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,300
But the most guilty thing is

578
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:00,300
General Mo Qingchuan.

579
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,300
He killed the people

580
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:09,300
and killed the blood of the people.

581
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,300
But he was lying.

582
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:16,300
But he broke the most impure water

583
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,300
and broke it.

584
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,300
Who are you?

585
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,300
Please tell me

586
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,300
who is the person

587
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,300
who killed the Mo's army?

588
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,300
Mo Qingchuan?

589
00:35:46,300 --> 00:35:47,300
Report!

590
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:49,300
Mo Qingchuan is dead.

591
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:52,300
He Amerika is going.

592
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:54,300
But General Mo Qingimei

593
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,300
burned Tiannan at Le실 River.

594
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:12,220
But the mistake seems to be

595
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,800
getting stupid even withросils

596
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,200
She really failed

597
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,000
on its own?

598
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,840
Qingchuan.

599
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,580
She's not even alive.

600
00:36:31,060 --> 00:36:32,420
General Qingchuan.

601
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,840
General hungry.

602
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,740
What else can one do?

603
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,120
Speak, Your Highness.

Four needs1

611
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,140
What did you just do?

612
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,260
General Mo,

613
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,180
you just got the Eight Hundred Jin Rui.

614
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,380
You're back to the enemy.

615
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,460
You succeeded.

616
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,660
That's true.

617
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,180
What did you say?

618
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:26,900
I made the decision.

619
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,220
Of course I made the decision.

620
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,260
But

621
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:34,500
this is indeed the hardest battle I've ever fought.

622
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,460
The enemy has been prepared to

623
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,580
ambush the army.

624
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,420
I checked it out in time.

625
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,100
So,

626
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,380
I made a move

627
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,460
and gave them trouble.

628
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:46,420
Once the enemy was trapped,

629
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:47,460
they set the camp under fire.

630
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:49,740
All I did

631
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,580
was risk death.

632
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,900
Only me and Chen had a battle like this.

633
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,660
What you expected me to do.

634
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:57,860
Yes.

635
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,940
I'm...

636
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,340
Do you know

637
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,900
All of them are lies.

638
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,900
All of them are fake.

639
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,700
You are innocent.

640
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,700
You said I was just a friend.

641
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,100
I got some gifts from the King of Chu.

642
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:28,100
I especially admire His Majesty and Empress Dowager.

643
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,140
This is the throne of the King of Chu.

644
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,140
It is the imperial seal of the Chu Dynasty.

645
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,740
And...

646
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:01,140
This is the imperial letter of Chen Siqi.

647
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,740
Is it enough?

648
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,340
Is it enough, Mo Junyu?

649
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,740
If it's not enough,

650
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:16,140
I still have evidence that you can't change.

651
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,140
What?

652
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,540
I...

653
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:24,540
am a person who should have died because of your conspiracy.

654
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,340
And Xinglian.

656
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,740
but was imprisoned for you.

657
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,140
I...

658
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,340
Mo Junyu...

659
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,340

660
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,340

661
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,440
However much...

662
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,840
Lets stay here...

663
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,840
as long as all of us will get thrown out.

664
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,120

ah?

667
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:04,940
This is not true.

668
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,860
This is not true.

669
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:11,020
This is not true.

670
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,340
Your dream

671
00:40:15,340 --> 00:40:16,940
is to become a murderer.
