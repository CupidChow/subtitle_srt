The future is a lie

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,600

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,080
She insisted that he was superior for Sino明白本職之分

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:48,120
so it was reported tell the Party of Sino

30
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,600
They told us to submit to high world

31
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,920
in order to retain color

32
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,560
We are not at the age of independently

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,800
I'm searching

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,840

there's something good.

44
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,080
The black jade from He Tian.

45
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,480
It's enough to be a heirloom.

46
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,840
Good job.

47
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,400

48
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,520
The Field has just started.

00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,600
I, Chen Siqi, once became the first commander of the Mo's Army.

61
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,040
I was a good man. I was not bad in martial arts.

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,640
I am now the guard of the Guards. I am in charge of all four.

63
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,520
This person...

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,320
may be killed.

65
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,920
Okay.

66
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,640
Zhou Zheng once was the commander of the Mo's Army.

67
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,240
He was a good man. He was a good man.

68
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,640
He was the guard of the Guards. He was in charge of all three.

69
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,360
This person...

70
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,240
is a scout.

71
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,400
Mo Junyu.

72
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,960
He once was the commander of the Mo's Army.

73
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,280
He was his wife, Cao Yuyan.

74
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,000
The old man's daughter.

75
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,160
She was the niece of the Queen Dowager Cao.

76
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,160
Mo Junyu was loved by everyone.

77
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,560
The two of them had a son, Mo Qinglian.

78
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,600
But later, he died in the year 2012.

79
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,760
He died in the year 2012.

80
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:48,560
Mo Junyu is the hero general of the Wei's Army.

81
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,600
He must be killed.

82
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,120
Coming.

83
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,560
Come.

84
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,200
Good.

85
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,320
It's almost time.

86
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:08,360
The Empress Dowager is coming.

87
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,640
Dragon.

88
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,520
Phoenix.

89
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:21,960
sekure.

90
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,960
I will definitely be punished.

91
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,960
Empress Dowager, Your Majesty.

92
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,960
Prince of Jing's Mansion, the Crown Prince of Xia Qi Guang has something to report.

93
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,960
Yes.

94
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Prince of Jing's Mansion is not a murderous family.

95
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,960
But someone in the court...

96
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,960
deliberately...

97
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,960
Prince of Jing's Mansion

98
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,960
Oho, you're looking at me with a hot head.

99
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Cao Ling'an?

100
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,960
Isn't he the one who used the Black Armor Army's gold and silver to go to the Qing Jiao Palace?

101
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,960
It's all Cao Ling'an's fault.

102
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,960
Yes.

103
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,960
The Crown Prince of Chansi Hall, the Chansi Hall's order is to send Cao Ling'an to the Crown Prince's Mansion.

104
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,960
I heard that the Crown Prince of Chansi Hall is behind the situation.

105
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,960
It's true that the Crown Prince of Chansi Hall is behind the situation.

106
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
It's not a surprise.

107
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,960
It's a surprise.

108
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,960
Qi Guang escaped by accident.

109
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:06,960
He personally sent the gold and silver to the Crown Prince's Mansion to get Cao Ling'an.

110
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,960
Please allow Qi Guang to be the one to be the one to be the one.

111
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,960
Yes.

112
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,960
We need to inform the Chansi Hall that...

113
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,960
I'm sorry.

114
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:19,960
The Chansi Hall's General Cao Ling'an was sent to the Crown Prince's Mansion by the Guards Army.

115
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,960
He has been using the Crown Prince's Mansion for years.

116
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,960
He has committed a serious crime.

117
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
You're not allowed to talk!

118
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

119
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,960
Go on.

120
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,960
The Chansi Hall and Cao Ling'an secretly established the Blood Sect.

121
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,960
They used poison to control the Chansi Hall's life.

122
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,960
They created a new level in the court.

123
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
They fought and fought in the civil society.

124
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,960
They committed a crime.

125
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,960
The Chansi Hall has been in the world for two years.

126
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,960
Chen Siqi and his father were killed.

127
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,960
They decided to kill the Crown Prince's Mansion.

128
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,960
The Chansi Hall's Escort Master checked the location of the lock door.

129
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,960
He found that Cao Ling'an and the lock door were in a fight.

130
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:05,960
They were both killed.

131
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,960
That's why they caught Cao Ling'an.

132
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
This is the first test.

133
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,960
Chen Siqi and Cao Ling'an controlled the lock door.

134
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,960
They bought the poison and used the poison to record.

135
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,960
The two of them were killed.

136
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,960
The poison was recorded and the poison was recorded.

137
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
The cause of death was poisoning.

138
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,960
The poison was right on the target.

139
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,960
Please withdraw.

140
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
Speak!

141
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,960
Speak!

142
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
What are you doing?

143
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Speak!

144
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
You poisoned her?

145
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,960
Your Highness.

146
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
Qi Guang doesn't know why she can't make it.

147
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
Who did it?

148
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,960
Your Highness.

149
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,960
If the lock door really exists,

150
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,960
I'm worried that the lock door will break.

151
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,960
If we don't deal with it,

152
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,960
it will cause the world to be in danger.

153
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,960
Your Highness.

154
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,960
Only one person can take the blame for this case.

155
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
It's not a good day.

156
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Who?

157
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,960
Please think twice.

158
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,960
Zhou Zheng.

159
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,960
Lord Zhou is a good person.

160
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,960
Zhou Zheng.

161
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
I'm here.

162
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:43,960
I order you to lead the guards to investigate this case.

163
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,960
Report to the King of Jin in the Heavens.

164
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Yes.

165
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:50,960
Guards.

166
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,960
Take Chen Siqi into the Zhao prison.

167
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,960
Your Highness.

168
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
Your Majesty.

169
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,960
Lord Chen.

170
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Let me go.

171
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Let me go.

172
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
Your Highness.

173
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:15,960
I'm the King of Yuan.

174
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Let me go.

175
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,960
My jade pendant.

176
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,960
Zhou Zheng.

177
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,400
When I pass by Qing Chuan Town

178
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
The crime is peaceful.

179
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,960
Kun tops the barrier

180
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,960
state the Adaptive Court of 사람us.

181
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,960
Zhou Zheng.

182
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,960
háXie components

Enjoy the yacht of sun.

186
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,680
It turns out that there is nothing to do.

187
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,800
Let's go to Lord Zhou's house to have a look.

188
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,720
Let's see what fun things there are.

189
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,240
Yes, Your Majesty!

190
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,560
Empress Dowager, Qi Guang personally investigated the case.

191
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,920
He is a spy.

192
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,800
But Qi Guang only wants to ask for a truth.

193
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,920
He has already sent my father to heaven.

194
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,720
I beg you to forgive me.

195
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,960
The crown prince has not been in the court for a long time.

196
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,000
He should have been.

197
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,240
Why should he be guilty?

198
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,600
K갑Lpost deDon, the new astronaut.

199
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,600
You慢ie!

200
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,280
K Upper Emperor sent you his..

201

Shout.

202
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,800
To the Grand Empress Dowager!

203
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,080
To the Grand Empress Dowager.

204
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:53,000
To the Grand Empress Dowager.

205
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,640
We이라 Electronic Is bumperong my mother clunk collector.

206
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,440

208
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,000
Do not lie!

209
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,840
diere!

210
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:06,840
The name of the temple is Dongnan Zuohao.

211
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,840
The name of the temple is Changming Deng Yi Zhan.

212
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,840
Thank you for your visit.

213
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,840
I'm afraid that the name of the night pearl is not even in the palace.

214
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,840
It's a bit interesting.

215
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,840
Prince of Jing, the prince of Jing is very skilled in making the

216
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,840
Chansi Hao.

217
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,840
Chansi Hao has six special gold chains.

218
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,840
It represents all the Chansi Hao's business.

219
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,840
Plus the one that the prince is holding,

220
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,840
it has three chains.

221
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,840
The five-legged master.

222
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,840
Father, Li Jingqian once told me that

223
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,840
this spring, the northern snow is very cold.

224
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,840
The people are all gone.

225
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,840
I'm sorry for the trouble that the Empress Dowager has caused.

226
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,840
Father, I'm willing to do anything to help you.

227
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,840
I'll help you to ease the burden of the Empress Dowager's heart.

228
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:15,840
Oh?

229
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,840
I'm so worried.

230
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
I'm so worried.

231
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:18,840
I'm so worried.

232
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,840
I'm so worried.

233
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,840
I'm so worried.

234
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
I'm so worried.

235
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:22,840
I'm so worried.

236
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
I'm so worried.

237
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,840
I'm so worried.

238
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,840
I'm so worried.

239
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
I'm so worried.

240
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:27,840
I'm so worried.

241
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,840
I need to remind you.

242
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,840
Even if the gold chains are not in the news,

243
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,840
they can be exchanged for the silver tickets of any Chansi Hao.

244
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,840
The silver tickets are in the news.

245
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
The gold chains are in the news.

246
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,840
The gold chains are in the news.

247
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,840
If anyone else is transferred,

248
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,840
the Chansi Hao will be in the Prince Jing's Manor.

249
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,840
I've decided to

250
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,840
think about it and prevent everything from being exposed.

251
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:56,840
Qi Guang will send the gold chains to the Empress Dowager.

252
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,840
I hope I can be filial to her.

253
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,840
I hope she can be filial to her.

254
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,840
I hope she can be filial to her.

255
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,840
You're a filial daughter.

256
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,840
You're a mother.

257
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,840
How can you be so stubborn?

258
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,840
I'll allow you to stay in the capital for three years

259
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,840
and take the Prime Minister to the capital city.

260
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,840
Go to the capital city.

261
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

262
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,840
The wind has blown and the silver is not released.

263
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,840
The Chansi Hao is now in the Empress Dowager's Manor.

264
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,840
It's not easy to be a crown prince.

265
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,840
I'm so sorry.

266
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,840
I heard that his mother passed away early in the morning.

267
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,840
He's the only one left at home.

268
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,840
Master, what are you thinking?

269
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:57,840
Prince Qin is dead.

270
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,840
He can only be killed by the line in the Palace.

271
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,840
But the current situation with the Empress Dowager

272
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,840
is a good start.

273
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,840
Junior brother is so miserable.

274
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,840
He's helpless and helpless.

275
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,840
Master, you're still thinking about what's the use of him?

276
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,840
This is his own choice.

277
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,840
We should go with him to cry together

278
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,840
and not to walk with him.

279
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,840
Owords溫ア

280
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,840
This Chansi Hao is indeed a great on- 서울 kingdom

281
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,840
and many famous people in the capital.

282
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:58,240
Envoy Hong and his others are still happy.

283
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,240
Tomorrow kid.

284
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:07,720
I understand.

285
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,420
Still need to 숯 mouth?

286
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,360
No.

287
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,200
I won't allow it.

288
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,480
Is that effective?

289
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:30,680
With Xια Qi Guang's今日は墓厂?

290
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,460
Will you give me some time?

291
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,360
Sure.

292
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,520
Let's go.

293
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,520
Just a moment, please.

294
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,240
Xia Qi Guang chose me for myself.

295
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,840
I'm back. Read it.

296
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,640
Don't forget that the person from the eastern part of the country,

297
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,840
the mother of the right-hand man, was sent to Lingxi Mountain to study.

298
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,440
It is said that the angel is smart and talented,

299
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,440
but he thinks he is ugly and often faces the wrong person.

300
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,240
This girl, three years ago, went to Lingxi Mountain

301
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,040
to receive the first white-haired man in the world,

302
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,240
the second-hand Qiu Yin in the world,

303
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:19,640
and the first demon girl, Jiang Kui.

304
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,640
She claims that she is the first to lose.

305
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,240
Although the name of the man is Chansi,

306
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:31,040
it is also called the first man in the east.

307
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,640
You are so absurd.

308
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,840
How can you show the king of the world

309
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,440
such a famous and attractive map?

310
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,640
Chansi is good.

311
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,240
But Bai Bai asked her to pick up a good one.

312
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,240
Why did you find out this person?

313
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,840
Of course, it was because of Xia Qigong.

314
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,440
His Majesty thinks that why did Cao Ling'an get poisoned?

315
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,840
When he left the Prince of Jing's Manor,

316
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,440
Qigong secretly handed over the accounts of the secret door

317
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,840
that was related to Cao Ling'an.

318
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,640
The secret door is a burial ground.

319
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:21,440
It is not only a secret door to the ministers in the court.

320
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,640
If the accounts of the secret door are not handed over to me,

321
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,040
the ministers will have to be dead to be removed.

322
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,640
I thought that Xia Qigong was a good man this time.

323
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,840
He must have a high rank in the back.

324
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:42,640
It seems that he was wrong.

325
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,040
Then how will mother punish Ling'an?

326
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,440
After all, she is your son-in-law.

327
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,240
What is she doing in the prison?

328
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,840
She said that she was fine all day and had a bad blood.

329
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,640
You can't be so noisy.

330
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,140
Don't wake up.

331
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,640
You shouldn't wake up.

332
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,840
There is a letter here.

333
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,840
Give it to Mr. Mo.

334
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,040
Yes.

335
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,040
Will the death of my father

336
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,440
be related to the content of the letter?

337
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,440
Di Shao?

338
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:35,840
Did Di Shao move the silver silk?

339
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,240
Li Kuan's family entered the Prince of Jing five years ago.

340
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,640
Maybe he can find the brother behind it.

341
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,640
No.

342
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,640
I promised master that I would take revenge on those two things.

343
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,840
How could a person be so heartless?

344
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,940
How could a disciple be so arrogant?

345
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,440
Little Junior Brother!

346
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,040
Master!

347
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,640
Did you stay in the capital?

348
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:10,040
Master, this letter was left by my father.

349
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,240
I will go to the Prince of Jing.

350
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,740
Three gold silk was sent out like this.

351
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,640
My heart aches.

352
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,640
It's not easy to solve the problem.

353
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:42,640
The money after the silk was earned by solving the problem.

354
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,760
Yes.

355
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,440
They are all rich.

356
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,640
Some are rich and some are rich.

357
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:57,040
How many gold silk is there in the first place?

358
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:01,040
I have never heard of such a big problem.

359
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,040
Why are they so dare?

360
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:07,040
I'm telling you, all the gold silk is poor.

361
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,840
Moreover, they are all afraid of me.

362
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,040
Do you know what is called a broken fortune?

363
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,640
How is it? Are you afraid?

364
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,440
Your father went to Lingzhou.

365
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,440
Everyone was looking for him as a noble and loyal wife.

366
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,640
But he was so mad.

367
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,640
But he was so greedy that he was hurt by the poor.

368
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,240
But in the past ten years, he was so greedy that he was hurt by the poor.

369
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,840
He was so arrogant that he was so arrogant that he was so arrogant.

370
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:50,440
He was so arrogant that he was so arrogant that he was so arrogant.

371
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,040
This is your father.

372
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:01,840
If father is willing to bear it, he will bear it again.

373
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,040
But he will be so angry that he will be so angry.

374
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,640
You... Why are you so arrogant?

375
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,240
It's actually a time to represent the gold silk that Chen Zehao gave.

376
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,840
I'm the one who is the sixth in the world.

377
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,240
These three gold silk...

378
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:26,040
were left to you by your father.

379
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,040
Chen Zehao, you and I will bear it together.

380
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:45,440
Chen Zehao, you and I will be together.

381
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,440
I am the most important one here in Lingzhong.

382
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,520
Chen Zehao, you and I are not sure

383
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,440
that you will thank me or make me leave with you.

384
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,240
Chen Zehao, you and I are not sure

385
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:02,840
that you will thank me or make me leave with you.

386
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,240
Chen Zehao, what are you saying...

387
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,120
to break it, right?

388
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,800
Tomorrow, you'll go to the palace

389
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,600
and wear a uniform.

390
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,800
Why should I wear a uniform?

391
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,680
It's better to wear some tears

392
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,120
to make people cry.

393
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,120
Yes.

394
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,240
It's best to cry out loud.

395
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,080
CKunction.

396
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,680
I couldn't排げ out with him.

397
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,360
If I couldn't karate,

398
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,200
you would shout like that.

399
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,200
We pay great attention to the Dokiton

400
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,360
and hold to our Merry Anniversary celebration.

401
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,240
Gentlemen,

00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,360

403
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,440
I'd like to give in

404
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,520
with respect to your knife.

405
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,280
See you.

406
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:07,860
Right.

407
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,200
manure.

408
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,800
What is it?

409
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,840
What's bad news?

410
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,900
highs.

411
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,740
The emperor is getting heirlooms in theaturndain.

412
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,480
He has to take the control.

413
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,120
If Liang prêt

414
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,580
Prince sour geehted

415
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,340
as your father stepped forward

416
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,760
andпu sent bieqing.

417
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,760
Prince, we can't do it.

418
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,760
We can't do it.

419
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,760
Please go back.

420
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,760
If they stop us,

421
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,760
we'll use the most common way of the Xia dynasty.

422
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,760
We can't just join them.

423
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,760
Understand?

424
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,760
Come on.

425
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:41,760
Brother.

426
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,760
I understand the rules.

427
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:45,760
Let's use them.

428
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,760
It's not a rule to be a soldier.

429
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,760
If someone asks you,

430
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,760
you'll say that it's a violation of the rule of the crown prince.

431
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
It's not a rule.

432
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:57,760
It's not a rule.

433
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,760
I promise.

434
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,760
Prince, you're filial to the emperor.

435
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,760
I'll wait for you.

436
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,760
Go.

437
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
Prince.

438
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,760
Please.

439
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,760
The family is settled.

440
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,760
Come on.

441
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:11,760
Be quiet.

442
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,760
Come on.

443
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,760
One.

444
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,760
Come on.

445
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,760
Prince, how about I do it?

446
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,760
One.

447
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,760
Be quiet.

448
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:23,760
Be quiet.

449
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,760
Go out.

450
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,760
Go.

451
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:27,760
Vice-Chairman Bai.

452
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,760
Why did the crown prince steal my fire?

453
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:34,760
Are you crazy?

454
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,760
Two.

455
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,760
Three.

456
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:37,760
One.

457
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,760
Two.

458
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
One.

459
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,760
Three.

460
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,760
I'll do it.

461
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,760
I'll do it myself.

462
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,760
I'll do it.

463
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,760
I'll do it.

464
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,760
I'll do it.

465
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,760
Enough.

466
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,760
Mr. Fang.

467
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,760
Don't move.

468
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,760
Put down the fire.

469
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,760
Prince.

470
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,760
What do you want?

471
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,760
Can you find something else?

472
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,760
Do whatever you want.

473
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,760
Don't bother me.

474
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,760
Yes.

475
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
I'll do whatever Vice-Chairman Bai asks me to do.

476
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,760
Run.

477
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,760
Run.

478
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,760
Yes.

479
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,760
Go.

480
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:09,760
Yes.

481
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,760
Go.

482
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,760
Brother Shi Tou.

483
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,760
Do you see?

484
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,760
Prince just ran over to give me the tea.

485
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,760
What's the matter?

486
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,760
In the morning,

487
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,760
he washed all the brothers' clothes.

488
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,760
So he's still a man of the army

489
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,760
to be a good man to serve the emperor.

490
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
What does he want?

491
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,760
Stop talking.

492
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
General Cao is here.

493
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,760
General Cao.

494
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,760
I heard Xia Qi Guang is here to win.

495
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,760
Yes.

496
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:07,760
Go.

497
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,760
Change him.

498
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,760
Yes.

499
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,760
General Cao, Xia Qi Guang ordered you to come here.

500
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,760
Greetings, General Cao.

501
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,760
Come in.

502
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,760
Yes.

503
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,760
Greetings, General Wei.

504
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,760
You two, go down first.

505
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
Yes.

506
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:33,760
Xia Qi Guang.

507
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,760
You can't see me as a black-headed man.

508
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,760
How can you let him be a high-ranking official?

509
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,760
He's my army.

510
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,760
You're a black-headed man.

511
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:47,760
If you want to die,

512
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,760
you can kill me.

513
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,760
General Cao asked me what I was fighting for.

514
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,760
It's just that you're a man of the army.

515
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:06,760
Not a man of the army.

516
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,760
Don't be so serious.

517
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:08,760
You're all serious.

518
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,760
You can't see me as a black-headed man.

519
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
Now you're a black-headed man.

520
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,760
You think I don't know what you want to do?

521
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,760
A common man can't be tolerated.

522
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,760
It's a shame to be a black-headed man.

523
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,760
This is your father.

524
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,760
He's a man of the army.

525
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,760
He's a man of the army.

526
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:29,760
Master is a man of the army.

527
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,760
My father is a man of the army.

528
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,760
Xia Qi Guang is a man of the army.

529
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,760
Master.

530
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,760
Master.

531
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,760
Master.

532
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,760
Speak.

533
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,760
Xia Qi Guang gave the three gold coins to the Empress Dowager on the funeral.

534
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,760
The two gold coins

535
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,760
have become the treasure of the north.

536
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,760
The Empress Dowager is very happy.

537
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,760
Now she's fighting in the imperial court.

538
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:59,760
Why don't we do it?

539
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,760
Why don't we do it ourselves?

540
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,760
Zihang Huai Tai.

541
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:14,760
You're a handsome man.

542
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,760
You should be done with.

543
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,760
Forget it.

544
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,760
Just leave your life

545
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,760
in the Empress Dowager's hands.

546
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,760
Go and clean up the horse.

547
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,760
Don't be so impulsive.

548
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,760
Yes.

549
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,760
Hurry up.

550
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,760
You've been delayed by the imperial court.

551
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,760
General Cao is guilty.

552
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,760
Hurry up.

553
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:47,760
You're not a master.

554
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
Hurry up.

555
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,760
Hurry up.

556
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,760
Hurry up.

557
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,760
Hurry up.

558
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:54,760
Hurry up.

559
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
Hurry up.

560
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,760
Hurry up.

561
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:57,760
Hurry up.

562
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:58,760
Hurry up.

563
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,760
Hurry up.

564
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,760
Brother.

565
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,760
Why is there a rumor in the imperial court?

566
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,760
What rumor?

567
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
Master.

568
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
It's not a rumor.

569
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:08,760
It's the Mo Army's rescue.

570
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
They're all a bunch of useless guys.

571
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,760
General Cao is guilty.

572
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,760
They're not only normal soldiers.

573
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,760
They're also forced to do dirty work.

574
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:17,760
Why?

575
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,760
Why?
