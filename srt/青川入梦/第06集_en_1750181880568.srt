1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,520
The birth of war

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
One city, one person.

3
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
One city, one person.

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
One city, one person.

5
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
One city, one person.

6
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
One city, one person.

7
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
One city, one person.

8
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Your Excellency,

9
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I really don't know where the master and the lady went.

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Two days ago,

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
the lady disappeared.

12
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The master sent her to the le-su.

13
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
She wanted 100,000 taels of silver.

14
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Le-su?

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The master took the silver and the man to the le-su.

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
After seeing the bandit,

17
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
the master looked very different.

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
After returning home,

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
the master went out alone after half a reward.

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
She didn't show up again.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Your Excellency,

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
we didn't find Chen Siqi's shadow in the house.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Yes.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I thought that

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Lord Chen and I

26
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
were already in the water.

27
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You're really joking.

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Thanks to your help,

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Chen Siqi was able to

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
show up for a while.

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Now that I fell into the mud,

32
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
how can you not pull me?

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Lord Chen has fallen into the mud.

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
He's really a good man.

35
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But you still came.

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
But you still came.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Prove that

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
the things in my hand

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
are hard to find.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Save me out.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Otherwise,

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
this evidence

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
will spread throughout the capital.

44
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Zhou Zheng is the one who interrogated you.

45
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I can't do anything about it.

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Lord Chen

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
will only die in this prison.

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Zhou Zheng,

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Lord Zhou.

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Others don't know that

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
you and I are both stupid.

52
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He can bend two legs at a time.

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Since then, he has been living in the capital

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
and fallen into the devil's trap.

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Look at your ugly face.

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
How did I get into your

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
ugly face?

58
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Save me out.

59
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I'll give you something.

60
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
From now on,

61
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
we are even.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
He escaped for the crime

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
or worried about me killing him?

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The medical room

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
has been targeted by someone.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Search Chen Siqi's room

67
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and find Chen Aimei.

68
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The holy demon will kill him.

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
The dead demon will kill him.

70
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Lord Chen,

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
come here.

72
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You are a new official.

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You can't do this.

74
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
General Zhang,

75
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
what's your doubt?

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Zheng Wuyou, Li Mao, Wang Guohua, Yang Yi,

77
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
and the dead one, Yang Yi,

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
are the former men of the Mo's Army.

79
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
How can you report to them

80
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
and transfer them to the God's Camp?

81
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Are they not qualified enough?

82
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I've carefully analyzed their skills.

83
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
In terms of martial arts,

84
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
their martial arts are superior.

85
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
In terms of military skills,

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
they are not worse than the Black Armor Army.

87
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
The sword skills of the God's Camp

88
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
are almost the same as the Mo's Army.

89
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Isn't it suitable for them?

90
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Lord, they are the ones

91
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
who can't get the title of the God's Camp

92
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
because of General Cao's words.

93
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Most of the officers in the God's Camp

94
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
have a close relationship with the Cao family.

95
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
If you do this,

96
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
you will be in a bad relationship with General Cao.

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
General Zhang,

98
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Cao Huai Tai is the younger brother of the Empress Dowager.

99
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
But the position of official is also

100
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
taken by the Empress Dowager.

101
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
General Zhang,

102
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
why do you think the Empress Dowager

103
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
did this?

104
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
General Zhang,

105
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
there is no reason for this.

106
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If something really happens,

107
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I will take responsibility.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Okay, then.

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'm leaving.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Master, are you okay?

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm fine.

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Tell me.

113
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
A year ago, according to the theory of the Dong family,

114
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
we started to pay attention to the whereabouts

115
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
of Mo Jun Yu and Cao Yu Yan.

116
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Indeed, Cao Yu Yan never went to the

117
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
worship ceremony of Mo Qing Lotus.

118
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Every month, he would go to a remote

119
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
mountain village.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It took about six hours from the capital.

121
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
If the calculation is correct,

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Cao Yu Yan would leave in two days.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
When Chen Si Qi

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
is in trouble, Mo Jun Yu

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
will soon realize that

126
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
he has not much time left for me.

127
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
By the way,

128
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
the Crown Prince went to Dong Jin Chan a few days ago

129
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
to ask for the painting of Zhou Jiusi.

130
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Don't stare at him.

131
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He has his own plans.

132
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Yes.

133
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Today is the day of the ancient rain.

134
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
The Empress Dowager should

135
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
hold a family banquet in the palace

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
to celebrate the arrival of the new year.

137
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
The ancient rain is coming.

138
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Everything is in full bloom.

139
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Today, I drink this cup with you.

140
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
May our dynasty be like the spring rain

141
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
and live a long life.

142
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Yu Yan brought a special

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
dance to accompany you.

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I hope you can be healthy

146
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
and live a long life.

147
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Your Highness, you are the best.

148
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Your Highness, you are the best.

149
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I know Yan well.

150
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Jun Yu,

151
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Yan is the pearl of the five elements.

152
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
If you treat him badly,

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I, the old woman,

154
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
will not spare you.

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Your Highness, don't worry.

156
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Yan is very affectionate to me.

157
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I am willing to guard him

158
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
and spend my life with him.

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Your Highness, you are a great fairy.

160
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You are the queen

161
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
of the royal family.

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The Empress Dowager

163
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
is kind and righteous.

164
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The people have been able to rest and live a happy life.

165
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I am very grateful.

166
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I asked the Zhou Jiusi of the Ming family

167
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
to draw a painting

168
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
and present it to you.

169
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
A white bird is flying.

170
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Good.

171
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
You are filial and heartless.

172
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You are very kind.

173
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I don't dare to be a part of it.

174
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Zhou Jiusi?

175
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Zhou Jiusi?

176
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I heard that Zhou Jiusi

177
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
has always been arrogant

178
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
and can't be left alone.

179
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Today, the Empress Dowager

180
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
must be happy to have this painting.

181
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Xia Qigong's skill of drawing horses

182
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
is really inferior to others.

183
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Give me the wine.

184
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
This wine is the Qingmei wine of Chu.

185
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It is a good time

186
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
to send the horse to our court.

187
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
It is made from the first batch of Qingmei wine.

188
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The sincerity of Chu

189
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
seems to be peaceful in the next five years.

190
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
The day will come

191
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
when we can enjoy the beauty.

192
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
The color is green.

193
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
The fragrance is beautiful.

194
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It is refreshing and sweet.

195
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
It is really a good wine.

196
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
The wine is very good.

197
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Empress Dowager,

198
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
can you

199
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
ask the Empress Dowager for another two cups?

200
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Although it is a good wine,

201
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
don't drink too much.

202
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Your Highness.

203
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The Qingmei wine is from Qingchuan Town.

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
But now

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
it is sent by Chu.

206
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
The royal family

207
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
will be in chaos.

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Qigong,

209
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
why don't you drink?

210
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Your Highness.

211
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I haven't attended the family dinner for a long time.

212
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I was shocked.

213
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Please forgive me.

214
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
This Qingmei wine

215
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
is from Qingchuan Town.

216
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
It is famous in all over the world.

217
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
But I have never tasted it.

218
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I want to take it back

219
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
to taste it.

220
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
What a poor child.

221
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
You drink it.

222
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I will send you two more cups.

223
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I will send you two more cups.

224
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I will send you two more cups.

225
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

226
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Your Highness.

227
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Your Highness.

228
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Be careful.

229
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What are you doing?

230
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I saw General Cao

231
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
drinking too much.

232
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
My mother taught me to drink.

233
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
How about

234
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
giving the last bottle to General?

235
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
I have everything I want.

236
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You are so stupid.

237
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
How dare you try to kill me?

238
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Get out of my way.

239
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
But you,

240
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
you can't even drink.

241
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
You want to die?

242
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Your Highness, are you all right?

243
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Please calm down.

244
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I

245
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
didn't mean to drink it.

246
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I didn't mean to drink it.

247
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
He is so arrogant.

248
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
He is so arrogant.

249
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
Qianyu, take him back

250
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
to take care of him.

251
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Yes.

252
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
I

253
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I

254
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
I am sorry to

255
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
disturb you.

256
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Your hand

257
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Go to the doctor.

258
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Yes.

259
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's okay. It's just a small injury.

260
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
Thank you for your concern.

261
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
It's just

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
it's the first time

263
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
you have given me a special reward.

264
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I feel sorry for you.

265
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Su Qi,

266
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
send two bottles of green plum wine

267
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
to Prince Jing's mansion.

268
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Yes. Thank you for your kindness.

269
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I will leave now.

270
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Su Qi,

271
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
what do you think

272
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
about Xia Qi Guang?

273
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
He is calm.

274
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
If he didn't

275
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
have no clothes in his house,

276
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
how could he be so humiliated by General Cao?

277
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
It seems

278
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
that Mrs. Hua is too much.

279
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
She only remembered

280
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
her surname is Cao.

281
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
But she forgot

282
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
her surname is Xia.

283
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
You are talking about

284
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
self-censorship to me.

285
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
You are so stupid.

286
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Uncle, please forgive me.

287
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Why do you

288
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
always get angry with a young man?

289
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
You are so narrow-minded.

290
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
No wonder you are so despised by your aunt.

291
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
When she was young,

292
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
she was suppressed by Prince Jing.

293
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
She couldn't see her father

294
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
or son.

295
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
She was jealous.

296
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
You think I will be jealous of her?

297
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
It's a joke.

298
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
She doesn't deserve it.

299
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
She deserves it.

300
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
She has my trust.

301
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
She has the Mo's knife skill.

302
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Why?

303
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Xia Qi Guang learned the Mo's knife skill.

304
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Who did he learn it from?

305
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Who did he learn it from?

306
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I...

307
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Mo Huang?

308
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
How could the Mo's knife skill

309
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
be used by the Mo's family?

310
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Uncle,

311
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
are you sure

312
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
that he is Mo Wan and not Mo Qing Chuan?

313
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I am sure.

314
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I will find someone.

315
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I have seen it.

316
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Master,

317
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
the box is ready.

318
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Do you know

319
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
the Mo's family of Chen Zi Hao?

320
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
I don't know.

321
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
He doesn't show up often.

322
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
But I heard that he is a high-profile person.

323
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
He is like a

324
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
rich man.

325
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Take him away.

326
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Yes.

327
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
You think he is back?

328
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Even if he is back,

329
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
he can be killed.

330
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Why do you care?

331
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Let's go to Chenún Commentary.

332
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
This is our stone mirror.

333
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
So we can see

334
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
they are different sky shapes.

335
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
Once he came out to the representation,

336
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
he worked podiatrically

337
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
to hide himself.

338
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
Then one day

339
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
No glory here.

340
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,740
He saved the ghost of Qingchuan.

341
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,460
Saved the steel mine at the Helian Mountain.

342
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:37,540
Even could change semaine's development.

343
00:17:44,860 --> 00:17:46,140
Mo Qingchuan,

344
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:48,140
I poisoned him,

345
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:53,140
but I also rejected him.

346
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,140
He is far away in Chu State.

347
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:01,140
Even if he really escaped,

348
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,140
you will always get news.

349
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,140
I hope he will die in the middle of the disease

350
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,140
and never come back.

351
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:16,960
Wow.

352
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,740
I knew you would come back.

353
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,740
This is the wine for you.

354
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:17,620
Qi Guang?

355
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,700
No matter what happens next,

356
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,380
I will always tell him

357
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,940
to protect you.

358
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:40,180
Qi Guang?

359
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,140
This is the wine of Qingmei.

360
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:49,060
Do you like it?

361
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:54,940
This wine

362
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,060
is for you to give to General Mo Qingchuan.

363
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,020
I'm just a small drinker.

364
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,580
How can I drink it?

365
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,060
I...

366
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,740
But what can I do?

367
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,300
I'm not him.

368
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,580
I'm not him.

369
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,260
I'm not him.

370
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,540
You worship him so much.

371
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,980
You found that I'm not him.

372
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,620
You're almost disappointed.

373
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,020
No.

374
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,220
In Qi Guang's heart,

375
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,660
I'm not someone else's shadow.

376
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:30,660
I'm...

377
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,220
a moon that's unique.

378
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,420
In your heart,

379
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,420
I'm more important than Mo Qingchuan.

380
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,600
Why do I do this?

381
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,300
How long has blocked be바틀

382
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,860

383
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,900
my career in many details.

384
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,100
I've never salted himself.

385
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,340
Even the moon

386
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:42,260
cannot tragedize him.

387
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,620
I am

388
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,260
Why hasn't Junior Brother come to see me these days?

389
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,060
I miss his carriage.

390
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,460
He's busy.

391
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,340
Fine.

392
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,700
He's so stubborn.

393
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:54,660
He wants to fight with me.

394
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,500
He'll come back.

395
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,620
One is in the southeast, the other is in the northeast.

396
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:13,020
Keep talking. Don't stop.

397
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,620
Ha ha ha.

398
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,460
You're laughing so awkwardly.

399
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,060
I'm so happy.

400
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,460
Black-shaired Chanzi, come back.

401
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,660
Save me, General.

402
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,900
Please spare my life.

403
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,900
I won't do it again.

404
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,660
Please spare my life.

405
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,500
Please spare my life.

406
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,900
I won't do it again.

407
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,020
Why do you want to kill me?

408
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,180
No, no, no.

409
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,140
I didn't mean to kill you.

410
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,700
It's us two

411
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,180
who saved money in Chanzi's account.

412
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,140
We saved some interest.

413
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,780
But we lost the ticket.

414
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,180
The manager said he didn't have the ticket

415
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:04,340
and wouldn't give us the money.

416
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,020
This is all my family's money.

417
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,780
We were so angry

418
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,420
that we wanted to kidnap the manager

419
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,500
and get the money back.

420
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,860
Why is the manager so stubborn?

421
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,380
You just need to prove your identity

422
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,340
with the protection card

423
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,500
and you can get the money back.

424
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:17,620
Really?

425
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:18,620
Yes.

426
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,860
Get out of here.

427
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,980
Go, go.

428
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:28,620
How can there be such a stupid person in the world?

429
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,900
You're so good at martial arts

430
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,980
and you even learn to kidnap people.

431
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,260
The general is too good.

432
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,660
Right?

433
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,740
I think so, too.

434
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,540
Ha ha ha.

435
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,460
We're finally home.

436
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,620
It's green plum wine.

437
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,740
Master.

438
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,140
This wine

439
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,820
is from Qingchuan.

440
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,180
Really?

441
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,620
It's really Qingchuan's wine.

442
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:23,100
This wine was sent by Junior Brother, right?

443
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:30,100
There's nothing special today.

444
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,580
Let's go and pick up your Junior Brother.

445
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:32,660
Okay.

446
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:38,820
Come on.

447
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,340
It's raining heavily.

448
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,660
Junior Brother.

449
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,300
Be careful.

450
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,340
We're here to pick you up.

451
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:46,980
I'm fine.

452
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,020
You haven't seen me for a few days.

453
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,380
Are you hiding from me?

454
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:14,100
I've never thought about it.

455
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,980
Then you're still blaming me.

456
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,740
I dare not.

457
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,180
It's just that

458
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:20,620
I'm a little nervous.

459
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:22,780
Since you're not angry,

460
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,740
then come home with me.

461
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,460
I'm sorry.

462
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,220
I'm sorry.

463
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:30,980
I'm sorry.

464
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,780
I'm sorry.

465
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,580
I'm sorry.

466
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,340
I'm sorry.

467
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,060
I'm sorry.

468
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,940
I'm sorry.

469
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,820
I'm sorry.

470
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,580
I'm sorry.

471
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,380
I'm sorry.

472
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,220
YouDaddy is not here.

473
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:45,980
Okay.

474
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,660
Junior Brother.

475
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:58,300
Where's your carriage?

476
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,660
I don't take the carriage usually.

477
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:05,580
So the carriage was prepared for me and Master.

478
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,220
How is it?

479
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,140
Master Mo doesn't know martial arts.

480
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,060
He just moves his legs.

481
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,020
He was chased by me and my junior.

482
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:37,300
Are you sure he didn't pretend?

483
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,780
Master,

484
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:42,220
my junior and I know how to hide our breath.

485
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:43,780
We're best at hiding.

486
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,860
Unless we're experts,

487
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,820
we can't be punished in advance.

488
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,100
Leave us.

489
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,140
Yes.

490
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,460
He doesn't know martial arts.

491
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,540
He just wants to show off

492
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,660
the Mo's knife.

493
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:06,860
It's better to be careful.

494
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:12,220
I think Mo Wang is interesting.

495
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,180
He can learn the Night Pearl

496
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,820
and get the Mo's knife.

497
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:21,420
The fan is so powerful.

498
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,500
Why don't you ask him to go to the Empress Dowager

499
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,940
and ask her to be happy?

500
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,060
What do you think?

501
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:38,440
It's just a valley full of

502
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:41,060
I'll invite Mo Wang to have dinner in the house tomorrow.

503
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:42,460
Master,

504
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:45,820
he must be very happy to invite you.

505
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:47,180
No.

506
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,180
Why?

507
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,220
He refused.

508
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,900
That's what our master said.

509
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:55,060
The Empress Dowager sincerely invites him.

510
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:58,060
I hope you can give him a chance.

511
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,300
Please come again.

512
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,900
I'll pass on the original words.

513
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,820
I've brought the master's words

514
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,660
to the original.

515
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,940
But I'm afraid you can't stand

516
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,620
the original words of our master.

517
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:11,980
What?

518
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,540
Mo Wang is really ungraceful

519
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,500
and rude.

520
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,740
Master, please don't take revenge on them.

521
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,580
In the capital,

522
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,700
there are still people who don't take my mansion

523
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,820
seriously.

524
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,180
I understand.

525
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,900
I'll ask someone to

526
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:33,620
take care of them.

527
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,180
Why do I feel

528
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,620
like I'm with the Four Great Masters?

529
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:42,980
Forget it.

530
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,020
Such an ungrateful person,

531
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,300
the more you care about him, the closer he gets.

532
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,060
Where is Madam?

533
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,940
Why don't you see her today?

534
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,180
Master, it's the fifth day today.

535
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,980
I'm afraid you can't see her.

536
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,860
I'll go with her.

537
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,340
I have more important things to do.

538
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:05,220
I've found Chen Siqi's body.

539
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:11,980
This...

540
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,700
This month's silver silk...

541
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,620
Thank you, Lord Zhou.

542
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,860
Lead the Hoje team to capital!

543
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:52,520
Head of the

544
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,360
Then,

545
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,320
are you really going in there?

546
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,640
Do you want us to...

547
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,320
If it's really him inside,

548
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,760
I want to go in there myself.

549
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:24,080
If it's him,

550
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,360
it's Yin Si Song again.

551
00:30:52,520 --> 00:31:17,760
Zou Azerbaijan

552
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,960
Are you mocking at me?

553
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,680
Or are you trapped here,

554
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:28,960
just like me?

555
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,480
Who are you?

556
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,360
Who are you?

557
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,060
It's over.

558
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,200
Qingyuan.

559
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,120
Qingyuan.

560
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,120
Get those things and give them back to him!

561
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,360
Eślometer!

562
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,960
Good game!

563
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,720
General Mo!

564
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,360
Get up!

565
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,840
Get up!

566
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,240
Lady Qing Chuan.

567
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,400
You're finally here.

568
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:39,560
The winds blow and the moon is bright.

569
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:46,440
The light tears,
