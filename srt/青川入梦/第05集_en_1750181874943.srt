1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:16,100
New A separate Treasure

2
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,280
Qi

3
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,140
What's the situation?

4
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:47,740
all have same one

5
00:01:48,740 --> 00:01:49,340
02

6
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,940
You

7
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,160
I

8
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,680
Although my father is ill,

9
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,640
the military forces of the Shu Bo still exist.

10
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,280
Why is the front losing so fast?

11
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,480
Not to mention that I was surrounded by the enemy

12
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,840
and I met the elite troops.

13
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,320
How did Chu get here?

14
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,680
How could Qingchuan be lost?

15
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,280
It's impossible.

16
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,480
It's impossible.

17
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:17,960
Luo Qingchuan,

18
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,160
surrender yourself.

19
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,080
Or I'll destroy this inn.

20
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,760
Jin Yue,

21
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,320
this inn is a two-story building.

22
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,440
It's Feng Shiyan.

23
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,600
Go.

24
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,720
They want me.

25
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,800
Go.

26
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:30,960
This is the military order.

27
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:34,920
Xue.

28
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:51,720
Go.

29
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,560
It's too dangerous.

30
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,520
If the old troops don't recognize you in the daytime,

31
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,960
the true identity of Master

32
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,120
will be exposed.

33
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,640
I decided to go back to the capital.

34
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,040
I hope this identity

35
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,360
can be kept secret.

36
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,800
I just used this ridiculous high-profile

37
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:25,960
to make the people

38
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,600
not to associate with Luo Qingchuan.

39
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,320
If the truth is revealed,

40
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,080
the one who should be panic is not me.

41
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:34,880
Do you think

42
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,040
Junior Brother found out?

43
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,960
He made a move.

44
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,440
Then why didn't you tell him the truth?

45
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,920
Everyone hates Mo Qingchuan.

46
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,160
He's the only one.

47
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,960
I remember

48
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,920
her look when he mentioned Mo Qingchuan.

49
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,920
What she thinks so stupid

50
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,100
still funds up that young man.

51
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,120
At the moment I'm in the dark,

52
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,200
later

53
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:08,880
later,

54
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,280
slimня will take her light away.

55
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,440
If he believes Mo Qingchuan,

56
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,440
he will also believe Mo Wang.

57
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,440
Qi Guang is here to see you.

58
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,440
Come in.

59
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,440
Come and eat.

60
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,440
Is it like the love of green plum wine?

61
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,440
Yes.

62
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,440
Yes.

63
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,440
Qingchuan's green plum wine is famous.

64
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,440
Have you tasted it?

65
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,440
Yes, I have.

66
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,440
Are you from Qingchuan?

67
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,440
Yes.

68
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,440
And me.

69
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Yes.

70
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,440
Why didn't you mention it before?

71
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,440
It's nothing special.

72
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,440
Why mention it?

73
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,440
Have you seen Mo Qingchuan?

74
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,440
Yes, I have.

75
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,440
It's familiar.

76
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,440
Master,

77
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,440
is it Mo Qingchuan?

78
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,440
No.

79
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,440
I know I can't hide it from you.

80
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,440
Actually, I was the former department of the Mo's army.

81
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,440
I was the shadow of Mo Qingchuan's general.

82
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,440
So I have seen the Mo's sword.

83
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,440
Then why...

84
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,440
Why I never saw you use the Mo's sword before?

85
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,440
I was badly injured during the war.

86
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,440
I have no internal energy.

87
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:44,440
I am not Mo Qingchuan.

88
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,440
I know.

89
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
Eat.

90
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,440
Okay.

91
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,440
What happened today seems to be against me.

92
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,440
But Cao Huai Tai made it difficult for you.

93
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,440
Yes.

94
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,440
Why did he make it difficult for you?

95
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,440
My mother was killed by Cao Huai Tai.

96
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,440
When I was a kid,

97
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,440
Cao Huai Tai's son Cao Lingxiu bullied people in the academy.

98
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,440
I couldn't bear to see him fight with Cao Lingxiu.

99
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,440
So Cao Huai Tai brought people to the mansion to make trouble.

100
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,440
My mother was pushed down by Cao Huai Tai to protect me.

101
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,440
She was injured to the head.

102
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:48,440
She died not long after.

103
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
How dare you!

104
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,440
What happened after that?

105
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,440
She was in prison for half a year.

106
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:00,440
She was beaten to death.

107
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:15,440
Cao Huai Tai used his power to cover up for the weak Nofu.

108
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,440
And you and your mother are the real brave people.

109
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,440
Xiguang, don't blame yourself for this anymore.

110
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,440
Qinglian's Feast

111
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:52,440
Today is Qinglian's Feast.

112
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,040
I picked a new dress for you.

113
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,240
Do you like it?

114
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,240
Do you like it?

115
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,240
Thank you, Madam.

116
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,720
If you don't want to change,

117
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,440
please change into your plain clothes

118
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,760
and worship with me.

119
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,440
I won't go back.

120
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,840
I won't go back today either.

121
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,440
My Qinglian is not dead.

122
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,440
She can't come back.

123
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,440
You know that.

124
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
Mu Jinyu.

125
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,240
I'm here to pick you up

126
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,040
to the book store.

127
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,640
I've read the book my father left me.

128
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,440
The 15th of every month

129
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,040
is the day of the book store's opening.

130
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,040
Master must be very busy today.

131
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,840
Senior sister, get in the car.

132
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,640
My junior brother is so sensible.

133
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,240
Now I don't have to fly to the palace.

134
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,440
It's better to ride a horse.

135
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,840
Master, come here.

136
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
After sunset,

137
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,040
I'll come to see you home.

138
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,040
Okay.

139
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,040
Okay.

140
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,040
And

141
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,040
Master will be so tired.

142
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,240
If you can't sit still,

143
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,440
go play for a while.

144
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,640
That's not good, Master.

145
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,240
Thank you, Master.

146
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
Thank you.

147
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,040
Master,

148
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,040
there was a scene in Taiwei's mansion two days ago.

149
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,640
Someone from Zhao Yu came

150
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,840
to send a letter to Mu Jinyu.

151
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:36,840
This is a letter from Chen Siqi and Chen Daren

152
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,040
to Taiwei.

153
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,640
Chen Siqi was released

154
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,440
this morning.

155
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,440
It seems that Chen Siqi's

156
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,840
work has worked.

157
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,040
But

158
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,840
Chen Siqi is so deeply connected

159
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,440
to Mu Jinyu.

160
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,040
It's surprising.

161
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,440
Master, are you okay?

162
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,040
I'm fine. Go on.

163
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,640
There's news from Chu.

164
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:08,640
Feng Shiyi

165
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:10,440
might represent the Chu delegation.

166
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,640
What's the answer now?

167
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,640
Mo Qingchuan.

168
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,640
Qi Yun,

169
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,840
send a message with silver silk.

170
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,840
Send Jin Chanzhou to check

171
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,240
the Chu's deployment.

172
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:31,240
Yes.

173
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,640
This is

174
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,840
the sign of the Mo's Army's vanguard camp.

175
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,240
Water grass.

176
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
If this person is in the Mo's Army's vanguard camp,

177
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,040
there must be a record.

178
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,840
Is there really a person named Water Grass?

179
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
Greetings, Guard An.

180
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,440
Greetings, my lords.

181
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,240
Qi Guang came here today

182
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,440
for a reason.

183
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
Qi Guang

184
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,240
wants to ask about someone.

185
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
Guard An, please.

186
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,640
Go ahead.

187
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,240
I'll tell you everything.

188
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,040
My lord,

189
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,040
you've never been under General Qingchuan's care.

190
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,640
I just want to ask you

191
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,640
if you know

192
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,440
Water Grass.

193
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,240
My lord.

194
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,440
Guard An, why do you ask?

195
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,440
Oh, I accidentally

196
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:22,240
heard about this name these days.

197
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:23,240
I'm a little curious.

198
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:24,840
My lord, don't worry.

199
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,240
Qi Guang has no evil intentions.

200
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,640
Water Grass.

201
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,040
On the day of the contest,

202
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,640
he was standing next to you.

203
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,240
I see.

204
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:40,240
He is the shadow guard of General Qingchuan.

205
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,840
But his identity is special.

206
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,840
So

207
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,040
I can't tell you more.

208
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
So Master is really Water Grass.

209
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,440
No problem.

210
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,640
My lords, you're so loyal.

211
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,440
I can't help you.

212
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,040
I'll keep it in my heart.

213
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:13,040
If he asks,

214
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,040
just say so.

215
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,040
Do you understand?

216
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,040
Yes, I do.

217
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,240
Master said

218
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,840
the day when Mo's Army will be rebuilt.

219
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,240
Okay.

220
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,240
We'll wait for General Qingchuan to come back.

221
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,840
Eat, Water Grass.

222
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,440
So easy.

223
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,840
You know I'm not Mo Qingchuan.

224
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,640
You don't even call me Master.

225
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,840
That's right.

226
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,240
Why didn't you tell me earlier

227
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:03,440
that you are Water Grass?

228
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
Being Mo Qingchuan,

229
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,640
the shadow guard of the traitor,

230
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
what's there to show?

231
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,640
Mo Qingchuan is not a traitor.

232
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,640
Give Mo Qingchuan more time.

233
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,840
There are plenty of shoes he can use

234
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,240
when changes change his face.

235
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,840
What's wrong with you?

236
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,240
Nothing.

237
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,040
My Junior is angry?

238
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:43,880
What?

239
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,080
Zhou Zheng,

240
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,640
the good official in the eyes of the world,

241
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,640
is protecting Chen Siqi.

242
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,400
I thought Wang Bachi could have a good wife.

243
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,720
If the Qingchuan Formation fails,

244
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,040
Mo Junyu must be a traitor.

245
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,000
He didn't expect me to survive

246
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,480
and be afraid of losing the case.

247
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,880
So he tried to force Chen Siqi to lure me out.

248
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,480
Maybe for some reason,

249
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,760
Mo Junyu didn't

250
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,720
kill Chen Siqi.

251
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,520
Maybe this is the reason

252
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,880
why he saved Chen Siqi this time.

253
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,080
But

254
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,680
I thought Zhou Zheng was deceived.

255
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,720
It seems that

256
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,480
Zhou Zheng knows everything

257
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,680
about the Qingchuan War.

258
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,720
So

259
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,800
he should have a real report

260
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,880
of the Qingchuan War.

261
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Are you going to rob him?

262
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,520
No hurry.

263
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,240
Let's deal with Chen Siqi first.

264
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,320
Since the law of the Xia Dynasty

265
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,000
is not suitable for Chen Siqi,

266
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,000
we have to use the way of the word Chuan

267
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,080
to punish him.

268
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:51,960
Jiang Hui,

269
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,720
are you curious

270
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,320
how much money Chen Siqi

271
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,160
has stolen after he ascended to the throne?

272
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,920
Very curious.

273
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,120
Chen Siqi

274
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,720
should be punished.

275
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,160
Find it.

276
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,960
Find it.

277
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,200
How could a living person

278
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,400
disappear like this?

279
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,600
Master,

280
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,520
we've searched the whole capital.

281
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,280
We really didn't find the girl.

282
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:24,920
The other day,

283
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,200
she told the master

284
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,120
to come back to help you clean up the old clothes.

285
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,920
But half of the people disappeared.

286
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,360
We searched everywhere,

287
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:32,160
and asked everywhere.

288
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,360
We almost found the girl.

289
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,800
Then kick her out.

290
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,480
Yes.

291
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:42,000
Master.

292
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,920
Master.

293
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,200
Master.

294
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,440
This...

295
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,040
You want to be a beauty?

296
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,840
Bring 100,000 taels of silver.

297
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,240
Tonight, you'll be killed if you don't see the money.

298
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,400
I'll tell you the location

299
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,560
when I have enough money.

300
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,520
Go.

301
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,040
Collect the money.

302
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,400
This is 100,000 taels.

303
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:14,240
All the money

304
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,800
is in the safe.

305
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,440
Exchange it for the silver.

306
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,160
Yes.

307
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,720
Touch my sister?

308
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,640
I, Chen Siqi, want to see

309
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,680
if you're willing to take the money.

310
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,800
What's the number?

311
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,640
Number seven.

312
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,960
But this time,

313
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,560
it's only 9,849 taels.

314
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
I even collected a gold bracelet

315
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,120
and changed the silver for 10,000 taels.

316
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,080
You're really rich.

317
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:47,960
Keep waiting.

318
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,360
Yes.

319
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,120
Master.

320
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,960
I've collected it.

321
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,840
The things I had in my house

322
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,360
are almost all stolen.

323
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,200
Master.

324
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,880
Do I really have to

325
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,480
give all the silver to the bandits?

326
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,920
Master.

327
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,760
I'm very worried.

328
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:09,920
I heard that tonight,

329
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,200
there will be a blood moon.

330
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,560
It's an ominous sign.

331
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,560
Cheng Xi broke the temple.

332
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,160
He's going to meet again alone.

333
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,520
Go.

334
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,080
Hey.

335
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,480
Hide and seek in the city...

336
00:20:59,040 --> 00:20:59,880
You're here.

337
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,800
You hid my sister.

338
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,480
Yes.

339
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:05,640
Where's he?

340
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,200
I bring the silver

341
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:08,360
and if I meet him,

342
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,560
and hand over the money.

343
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,240
We agreed to come here alone.

344
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,920
But we brought so many people to guard outside.

345
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,880
Lord Chen, you don't trust me.

346
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,720
I'm afraid I won't see your sister again.

347
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,960
You're so arrogant that you dare to threaten me.

348
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,120
I'll kidnap you now.

349
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,640
If you don't release me,

350
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,040
I'll make you suffer a terrible death.

351
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:38,520
You dare not kidnap me.

352
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,840
You can't afford to offend my master.

353
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,080
In the capital,

354
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:48,040
there's no one I can't afford to offend.

355
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,240
Really?

356
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,480
Who?

357
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,840
I have a problem in my heart.

358
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,840
I just asked for the god's name.

359
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,560
I just asked for the god's name.

360
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:09,120
Why did I hear the rumors yesterday,

361
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:12,000
but my old friend is not here today?

362
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,560
Why is Wenjing's friend not as good as Suiyin?

363
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:19,840
He's so loyal that he's bullied.

364
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,000
You'd better

365
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,600
tell me.

366
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,560
General Xingchuan.

367
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,520
Chen Siqi, I just asked once.

368
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,240
Why did you betray me?

369
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,160
Why did you betray the Mo's Army?

370
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:53,160
I was ordered by General to check the Liyazhen.

371
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,560
But I failed.

372
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,400
I was caught in the hands of Mo Junyu.

373
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,960
He and my sister

374
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,960
are related by the child in his belly.

375
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,080
Before my mother died,

376
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,920
she asked me to take care of her

377
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:08,080
with all my heart.

378
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,120
So,

379
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,440
General,

380
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,680
I can only let you down.

381
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,280
If you betrayed me just for your sister,

382
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,680
I don't blame you.

383
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,120
But I have a problem in my heart.

384
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,160
In just five years,

385
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,960
how did you become the guard of the capital?

386
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,400
Because

387
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,800
Liang's Manor hometown,

388
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,400
Saozong Prefecture

389
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,760
is in Shantang City.

390
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,360
The name of the town is located in Mo's Mang,

391
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,400
it's in Y 왜ations Liyiaov Suchuan.

392
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,480
where appear and are intellectual flooding.

393
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,100
As nothing exists.

394
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,040
You volcano

395
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,880
Bumped into the canal of the Howeveru.

396
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,720
The rank has never been game

397
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,720
What do I have?

398
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,440
A life.

399
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,360
A weak sister.

400
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,560
A general who has conquered the city and has suffered a lot.

401
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,480
Who doesn't know you, Mo Qingchuan?

402
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,320
But back then,

403
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,560
tens of thousands of Chen Siqi

404
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,840
died in Qingchuan Town.

405
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,320
Who

406
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,800
still remembers their names?

407
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,680
Back then, I was just

408
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,920
pushing the boat along the water.

409
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,600
General,

410
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,800
look down on your noble head

411
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,240
and look at the world.

412
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,080
It's not about recognizing me,

413
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,760
but about me.

414
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,200
So,

415
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,560
you won't come back?

416
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600
I won't.

417
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,240
Come on, General Qingchuan.

418
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,480
Let's have another drink.

419
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,440
Come on.

420
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,560
Come on.

421
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,120
Come on.

422
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,200
Come on.

423
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,160
Come on.

424
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,360
Good wine.

425
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:03,360
Good wine.

426
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,160
Forget it.

427
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,840
You betrayed the Mo's Army

428
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,640
and wrote a confession letter.

429
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,360
I let your sister go.

430
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,520
As for you,

431
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,080
you have to pay for it.

432
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,840
Don't try to escape.

433
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,040
You know it.

434
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,760
You can't escape.

435
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,080
Lord Chen,

436
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:29,800
please.

437
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,640
Master,

438
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:41,880
please check it.

439
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,280
Give me the bank note.

440
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,240
It's useless to keep it anyway.

441
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,560
Yin Shi, Chen Jiao, Haitang, Lao Shu,

442
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,800
I'll take you to see your sister for the last time.

443
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:15,160
Master,

444
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,680
it seems that he doesn't know you're a Mo's Army.

445
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,800
He's still a fool to see you.

446
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,320
Jin Shi, the martial artist.

447
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,520
Mo Qingchuan's martial arts were abolished?

448
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,200
Was it just a false statement?

449
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,080
Yes.

450
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:43,560
Feng Shiyi is a man of his word.

451
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,000
How could he leave his martial arts

452
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,400
and let him turn over?

453
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,000
Besides, he's a devil.

454
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,640
Do I have to wait for him to be killed?

455
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,320
Kill him.

456
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,760
Take back your crime letter.

457
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,640
Sister.

458
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:08,960
Brother.

459
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,160
Brother.

460
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,240
It's great that you're fine.

461
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:17,480
General Qingchuan brought me here

462
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,440
and said nothing.

463
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,120
I thought something happened to you.

464
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,400
Brother,

465
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,920
you haven't seen General Qingchuan for years.

466
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,600
He must have a lot to say.

467
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,080
How about I evade him?

468
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,080
Sister, listen to me.

469
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,720
Leave now.

470
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,600
Don't ask anything. Don't turn back.

471
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,480
Don't go back to the capital.

472
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,160
Go.

473
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:40,640
Brother.

474
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,240
Go.

475
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,600
You still can't bear to leave him.

476
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,680
You can't let go of everything.

477
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:01,080
I finally became the guard.

478
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,160
Why did you come back?

479
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,080
Yes.

480
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,640
I'm the guard.

481
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Mu Qingchuan.

482
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,680
You're a traitor.

483
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,400
You're sick and in a panic.

484
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,880
You want to kill me?

485
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,800
You only have dozens of soldiers.

486
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,840
What do you think you can do to me?

487
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,080
Mu Qingchuan.

488
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,480
You're a master of martial arts, right?

489
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,880
Chen Siqi.

490
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,920
If you confess your crime,

491
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,240
I wanted to abolish your martial arts.

492
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,240
I

493
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,600
gave you a chance.

494
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,880
I'll kill you.

495
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,560
I'll kill you.

496
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,160
I'll kill you.

497
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,760
I gave you a chance.

498
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,400
No. No.

499
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,760
General Qingchuan.

500
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Don't kill me.

501
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,960
I was wrong.

502
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,880
We used to be friends.

503
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,560
Qingchuan.

504
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,280
Let me go.

505
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:20,560
I'll exchange it with a secret.

506
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,120
Sorry.

507
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,800
I saw you.

508
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,280
I only saw it in your frame.

509
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,560
Don't feel sorry.

510
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,240
smelly PRESIDENT

511
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,440
The mysterious ability to break the shield

512
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,640
has been fixed.

513
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,400
Let me go.

514
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,040
I have to try again.

515
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,080
But if you don't believe me,

516
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,480
I'll turn my back on you.

517
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,800
Do you want to kill me?

518
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Jing Chuan, I beg you.

519
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,160
So,

520
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,160
you should have died long ago.

521
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,160
Master.

522
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,160
Chen Siqi,

523
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,160
betray the Mo's Army,

524
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,160
execute the military,

525
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,160
execute the war,

526
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,160
and bury him in the ground.
