00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,967
JINNY'S KITCHEN

2
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,300
The boss' dimples are getting deeper.

3
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:31,667
He's completely changed.

4
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:34,033
It's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

5
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,033
Is it still possible to eat here?

6
00:00:36,133 --> 00:00:37,266
No, we're closed.

7
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:39,367
Hey!

8
00:00:39,467 --> 00:00:40,367
Hello!

9
00:00:40,467 --> 00:00:42,100
We're gonna make a table for you.

10
00:00:42,133 --> 00:00:43,667
Put these tables together.

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,166
We barely made it.

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,433
That's why I had them.

13
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:50,934
You're smiling ear to ear.

14
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:53,166
Whoa!

15
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,734
So refreshing. Come in.

16
00:00:58,667 --> 00:01:00,734
Hello.

17
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:03,066
- Vámonos!
- Vámonos!

18
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:05,500
I think I got the hang of it now.

19
00:01:05,567 --> 00:01:07,066
- Nice!
- Nice!

20
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:08,233
Okay!

21
00:01:08,233 --> 00:01:10,467
- We just opened, and we're full.
- I know.

22
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:12,367
One more thing to do to be promoted.

23
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:13,900
- It's speed.
- Okay.

24
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Okay.

25
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,033
Our teamwork is getting better.

26
00:01:17,133 --> 00:01:18,200
Yes.

27
00:01:26,967 --> 00:01:29,133
I smell ramyeon.

28
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,834
Sweet and spicy Korean fried chicken?
Oh, my gosh.

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,500
Hola.

30
00:01:38,066 --> 00:01:39,333
Woo Shik.

31
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:40,467
Woo Shik!

32
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,967
- Yes.
- Come on out.

33
00:01:42,767 --> 00:01:45,133
Hola.

34
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:46,900
How many? Four?

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,533
- Four.
- Four.

36
00:01:55,233 --> 00:01:57,400
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,433
- Oh, take it slow.
- He's done.

38
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:01,567
It's okay.

39
00:02:02,266 --> 00:02:03,633
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

40
00:02:05,233 --> 00:02:06,934
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

41
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:12,867
Your table is ready.

42
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,166
I'll order the hellamyeon.

43
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
It's very spicy.

44
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,867
- Very.
- Oh, no.

45
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,033
But very tasty.

46
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,633
Like habaneros?

47
00:02:25,734 --> 00:02:27,033
Habanero? No.

48
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,033
This is really good.

49
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,967
- Yeah?
- There's a sample of it here.

50
00:02:34,967 --> 00:02:36,066
I wanna try that.

51
00:02:37,567 --> 00:02:40,300
- One of this, and this.
- Okay.

52
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:42,100
We ordered everything to share.

53
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:44,066
- Or do you--
- No. We ordered our menus.

54
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,300
Oh, okay.

55
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:48,500
- Bulgogi gimbap.
- Bulgogi?

56
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:51,300
And pineapple juice.

57
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,667
- Pineapple juice? Two?
- Yes.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,667
- We got an order.
- Okay.

59
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:00,934
We keep getting chicken orders.

60
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,900
Yu Mi.

61
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:04,133
Could you put it here?

62
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:46,500
Chibap. We got a chibap order.

63
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,100
Whoa, what… Man, that was close.

64
00:04:03,767 --> 00:04:05,300
I almost put the oil in it.

65
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:12,500
Working on the chicken?

66
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,667
Yup, I'm making two.

67
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,333
- Are you making both at once?
- Yes.

68
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:56,433
Gimbap?

69
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:58,767
Yes.

70
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:01,467
- Chicken?
- Thank you.

71
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:08,967
This is really good.

72
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:18,000
This food…

73
00:05:18,066 --> 00:05:20,600
I can have five plates of it.

74
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:25,066
I can have 250 pieces.

75
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:29,700
Let me try this.

76
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:31,500
How's the chicken?

77
00:05:35,734 --> 00:05:38,066
It's really good, right?

78
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:40,433
It's so good.

79
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:42,567
The best food I've ever had.

80
00:05:45,667 --> 00:05:46,934
It's really good.

81
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,567
It's really good, right?

82
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,433
Mmm!

83
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,033
Could you leave me some?

84
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,667
Would you like to have some?

85
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,066
Leave me some, please.

86
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:08,200
We finished it.

87
00:06:08,266 --> 00:06:09,533
This chicken's so good.

88
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:13,633
It'd be awesome to visit Korea.

89
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:16,800
The chicken…

90
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:20,233
Two, four, six, eight, ten…

91
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,266
We have only one order of chicken left.

92
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,500
We should fry some more.

93
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:34,233
I…

94
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,600
Seo Jin.

95
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:37,900
Woo Shik?

96
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:42,567
What's this called?

97
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:43,667
Chicken.

98
00:06:44,433 --> 00:06:47,033
Oh, it's over there. Thanks.

99
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:49,266
One spicy pork gimbap.

100
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,533
One tteokbokki.

101
00:06:50,633 --> 00:06:52,533
One fricken.

102
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:57,000
- Seo Jin.
- Yes?

103
00:06:57,066 --> 00:07:00,066
We have only one serving of chicken left.

104
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,100
I just got one order. That'll be last.

105
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,033
- Yes.
- Okay.

106
00:07:08,567 --> 00:07:09,934
Can I order for to-go?

107
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,433
I want to take some home.

108
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,033
There are combo menus too.

109
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,400
Jinny's Combo?

110
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,300
It's very delicious.

111
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:19,633
The food is really good.

112
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:26,433
- To-go?
- To-go.

113
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:53,433
Are we really getting famous?
What's going on?

114
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:56,033
People keep rushing in, right?

115
00:07:56,133 --> 00:07:57,767
People are waiting again.

116
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,266
Man.

117
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:11,800
I'll wait there, so they can sit here.

118
00:08:12,834 --> 00:08:14,600
I feel bad seeing them waiting.

119
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,166
- I'll sit there so they can sit here.
- Oh, okay.

120
00:08:17,233 --> 00:08:18,600
Thank you.

121
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,400
Let's do the same.

122
00:08:22,467 --> 00:08:24,000
So the people can sit here.

123
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,800
We're done.

124
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,900
We're just waiting for our to-go order.

125
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:30,667
We can wait over there.

126
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:34,633
You can go sit there.

127
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,767
Thank you.

128
00:08:41,667 --> 00:08:42,867
We got an order.

129
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,333
An order.

130
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,233
We got Jinny's Combo B.

131
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,633
Yu Mi, we got one Jinny's Combo,

132
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,066
and the gimbap is to-go.

133
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,834
- Could you pack it here?
- Sure.

134
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,467
- Jinny's Combo B for to-go.
- Okay.

135
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:13,967
Order up.

136
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:31,900
Jinny's Combo B.

137
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,233
Thank you.

138
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,000
Half & half tater dog for to-go.

139
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,066
Okay.

140
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:42,633
Thank you. See you later.

141
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,967
Hello.

142
00:10:06,066 --> 00:10:08,467
- Hello.
- Hello. Good afternoon.

143
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,000
I'd like to order this.

144
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,100
For me, this.

145
00:10:12,834 --> 00:10:15,734
- Tteokbokki?
- Yes.

146
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,600
But today is a weekday.

147
00:10:20,667 --> 00:10:22,333
Today is a weekday.

148
00:10:23,266 --> 00:10:24,900
Interns

149
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:27,000
don't care how much money we make.

150
00:10:27,066 --> 00:10:31,200
It's not like I'll get a raise
if we make a lot of money.

151
00:10:31,266 --> 00:10:33,300
It won't do me any good.

152
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:34,834
- It only tires me.
- Tae Hyung.

153
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,100
- Yes?
- Tae Hyung.

154
00:10:36,266 --> 00:10:38,300
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

155
00:10:42,734 --> 00:10:44,533
I wanna go to the restroom, but…

156
00:10:51,934 --> 00:10:53,600
Wait. Whose table is that?

157
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,100
The three people here.

158
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,500
- They're four people.
- Where?

159
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:58,500
Four.

160
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,633
- They can't sit there.
- But…

161
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,767
We can't extend it.

162
00:11:10,033 --> 00:11:11,433
Excuse me.

163
00:11:11,533 --> 00:11:14,233
Is it okay if you move
to the table over there?

164
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,633
Thank you.

165
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,433
It's better here.

166
00:11:20,533 --> 00:11:22,800
I can feel the wind better here.

167
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,633
Today is such a busy day for us.

168
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:26,834
Really?

169
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,800
You can order here.

170
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,233
- How did you seat them?
- I moved the table.

171
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,200
How?

172
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:45,667
Tae Hyung, after this, could you fry'
two dumplings

173
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,066
and four laver rolls for tteokbokki?

174
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:49,433
- After this.
- After this?

175
00:11:49,533 --> 00:11:53,233
Brain freeze, brain freeze…

176
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,467
Four dumplings?

177
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:57,700
Two dumplings and four laver rolls.

178
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,233
Hey, hey.

179
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,533
Come on. Boil now.

180
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,100
Still no chicken?

181
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,867
No, not yet.

182
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:17,767
I'll reject all chicken orders then.

183
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,633
- Order this or this.
- Sweet and spicy?

184
00:12:22,567 --> 00:12:24,000
One tteokbokki?

185
00:12:24,266 --> 00:12:25,633
And this.

186
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,633
- One bulgogi gimbap?
- Yes.

187
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,367
One more?

188
00:12:32,533 --> 00:12:34,266
- We got an order.
- Okay.

189
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:35,433
Endless orders.

190
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:39,400
Two half & half corn dogs.

191
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,734
Two tteokbokkis.

192
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,300
We should fry two and four each.

193
00:12:44,367 --> 00:12:46,367
Two dumplings and four laver rolls.

194
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,433
The last order?

195
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,400
Yes. Close the restaurant.

196
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,433
Look at us.

197
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:07,500
I think we're really cool now, Tae Hyung.

198
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:09,200
- Happy face.
- Okay.

199
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:10,467
Oops, sorry.

200
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:14,533
Put the dumplings here.

201
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,033
- Then pass it.
- Okay.

202
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,767
For the Bronze table.

203
00:14:00,867 --> 00:14:02,433
Here you go.

204
00:14:03,834 --> 00:14:06,500
Grab it with these and cut it with them.

205
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,834
Okay, thank you.

206
00:14:08,934 --> 00:14:11,233
- That looks amazing.
- Wanna try it?

207
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,900
- Let's see.
- One second. I'm holding it.

208
00:14:13,967 --> 00:14:15,233
Done.

209
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,233
Try it.

210
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,467
After you.

211
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,967
Tell me if it's spicy.

212
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:24,467
Is it good?

213
00:14:25,133 --> 00:14:26,333
Mmm!

214
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,166
What?

215
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:29,367
It's amazing. Try it.

216
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,100
- Are you sure?
- It's a bit spicy.

217
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,867
- Not too spicy?
- Not for me, because I eat chilis.

218
00:14:33,967 --> 00:14:36,066
Okay. I trust you, so I'll give it a try.

219
00:14:40,066 --> 00:14:41,467
It's good, right?

220
00:14:41,567 --> 00:14:43,767
I'm not sure what this is, but it's good.

221
00:14:43,834 --> 00:14:46,333
- It's good.
- You love it.

222
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,533
I like the spongy texture on the outside.

223
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,433
I can feel the heat,

224
00:14:52,834 --> 00:14:55,800
but it's not too spicy.
It feels rather sweet.

225
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:58,133
I've never tried something like this.

226
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,166
Me neither.

227
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,867
Aren't you going to try this pasta?

228
00:15:01,934 --> 00:15:03,900
It smells super spicy. I wanna try it.

229
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,233
Try it.

230
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,800
Oh, I forgot to take photos.

231
00:15:11,166 --> 00:15:12,967
How is it? Spicy?

232
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:17,567
It's good.

233
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:18,533
Is it?

234
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,700
Spicy or not spicy?

235
00:15:19,767 --> 00:15:21,000
It's normal spicy.

236
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:23,633
It's spicy, but normal spicy.

237
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,033
It's very spicy.

238
00:15:28,567 --> 00:15:29,467
Not for me.

239
00:15:29,533 --> 00:15:31,033
It's spicier than this.

240
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,467
I thought it'd be spicy, but it's okay.

241
00:15:33,533 --> 00:15:35,467
You'll see. Have some more.

242
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,533
It's so good I can't stop eating it.
But it gets hotter.

243
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:49,834
At first, it wasn't hot.
But I feel the burn.

244
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,900
Look at my eyes.

245
00:15:53,867 --> 00:15:55,467
It starts to really burn.

246
00:15:56,667 --> 00:15:57,767
And my eyes…

247
00:15:58,867 --> 00:16:00,333
But it's so good.

248
00:16:03,066 --> 00:16:09,533
I've never seen such good-looking people
working in such a pretty restaurant.

249
00:16:10,133 --> 00:16:13,133
Here you go.

250
00:16:23,133 --> 00:16:26,166
You're right. They're so handsome.

251
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:28,467
Like me?

252
00:16:28,533 --> 00:16:30,433
- No.
- No? I don't look like them?

253
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,767
No.

254
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:34,667
You're mean.

255
00:16:34,734 --> 00:16:36,734
You look like that drawing over there.

256
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,500
That drawing over there?

257
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:44,066
What's wrong with today so far?

258
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:47,300
Looks like we'll make
over 10,000 pesos again.

259
00:17:27,767 --> 00:17:29,000
Two corn dogs.

260
00:17:33,633 --> 00:17:35,467
Nice. Well done.

261
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,400
Tteokbokki, for you?

262
00:17:44,333 --> 00:17:45,333
Gimbap?

263
00:17:52,367 --> 00:17:54,667
Dessie, this one's really good.

264
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:58,400
It has the grill flavor.

265
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,967
Does it?

266
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:02,367
This tteokbokki is really good too.

267
00:18:05,133 --> 00:18:07,367
Dip it in the sauce.

268
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,834
It's so good.

269
00:18:11,967 --> 00:18:13,266
Isn't it hot?

270
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:21,066
It's really good.

271
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:33,100
Órale

272
00:18:33,834 --> 00:18:36,266
- That looks nice.
- Yeah.

273
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:39,100
Wow, we sold 5kg of chicken today.

274
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:40,967
- Including this?
- Yes.

275
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,066
- Sir.
- Yes?

276
00:18:45,133 --> 00:18:47,500
Does the break start
after the customers leave?

277
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,500
No, you can rest.

278
00:18:49,266 --> 00:18:50,734
But we need to fry chicken.

279
00:18:50,767 --> 00:18:52,900
Right. Then fry the chicken first.

280
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:55,700
Will I get an extra 15 minutes
of break then?

281
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:58,033
Of course not. Hey.

282
00:18:58,133 --> 00:18:59,533
It's not even 4 PM yet.

283
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,166
Oh, no.

284
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:22,433
It's okay.

285
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,166
It was spicy.

286
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,767
Macho, macho.

287
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:33,433
What's the total?

288
00:19:33,467 --> 00:19:34,367
- What?
- How much?

289
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:36,734
- I haven't calculated it.
- Do it now.

290
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,567
We reached the number.

291
00:19:46,633 --> 00:19:47,600
We hit 5,000.

292
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,734
We hit 5,000 pesos.

293
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,867
We hit 5,000.

294
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,934
- We hit 5,000?
- Yes.

295
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,867
We even hit 6,000 pesos.

296
00:19:56,934 --> 00:20:00,800
I felt just like this
on the day we hit 10,000.

297
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,433
We need to grab some food, right?
Aren't you hungry?

298
00:20:03,533 --> 00:20:04,533
How about ramyeon?

299
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,934
No more ramyeon.

300
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:07,934
I can't do it any more.

301
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:10,333
Still, we need to eat.
What do you wanna eat?

302
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,266
- Me?
- Yes.

303
00:20:11,333 --> 00:20:12,567
I…

304
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:13,667
I want to rest.

305
00:20:13,767 --> 00:20:15,300
- You can rest.
- Okay.

306
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,600
Let me just take some rest.

307
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,133
I don't wanna eat.

308
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:21,633
- I'll go buy some burritos.
- Okay.

309
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:22,867
One without cilantro.

310
00:20:22,934 --> 00:20:25,500
- Cilantro?
- Tae Hyung doesn't eat cilantro.

311
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:27,834
We must be getting famous here.

312
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,867
We might actually hit 100,000 pesos.

313
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:32,433
We should do more tteokbokki.

314
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,000
I'm just gonna order one meat,

315
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:03,700
one sausage,

316
00:21:03,734 --> 00:21:05,166
one shrimp,

317
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,333
- one chicken...
- One of everything?

318
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:08,867
One of each, yes, and...

319
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,400
No cilantro, please.

320
00:21:10,467 --> 00:21:11,367
Okay.

321
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:13,266
Nice place, huh?

322
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:14,333
It's nice here.

323
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,166
They're very systematic.

324
00:21:25,266 --> 00:21:26,333
Right?

325
00:21:26,433 --> 00:21:29,567
I wonder how much they make daily.
What do you think?

326
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,467
What?

327
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:32,867
We're famous here too now.

328
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:35,400
Starting today,
I bet we'll hit 10,000 every day.

329
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,633
And hit it easily, even.

330
00:21:39,066 --> 00:21:41,500
Don't say that.
You might be bummed tomorrow.

331
00:21:42,533 --> 00:21:44,500
I don't think it'll happen again.

332
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:47,333
We're on a roll now.

333
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:50,667
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

334
00:22:00,367 --> 00:22:01,500
I fried them all.

335
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:02,700
Well done.

336
00:22:03,633 --> 00:22:05,333
You did a great job.

337
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,500
It's looking good.

338
00:22:07,567 --> 00:22:09,233
- It looks good?
- Yes.

339
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,300
- Isn't it easier that way, right?
- Yes.

340
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:12,767
Put it there when done.

341
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,033
It's not easier.

342
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,166
I just don't think I can be

343
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:19,333
as good as you are.

344
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,734
- Come on.
- I just think

345
00:22:21,834 --> 00:22:23,600
you have

346
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,433
really skillful hands.

347
00:22:27,533 --> 00:22:29,734
Really, the color looks great.

348
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:31,834
Let's eat.

349
00:22:32,667 --> 00:22:34,600
- What's this?
- Which one's no cilantro?

350
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,767
All of them.

351
00:22:35,834 --> 00:22:37,166
Thanks for the food.

352
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:39,500
- Thank you.
- Take one each.

353
00:22:39,567 --> 00:22:41,333
It's the most famous place here.

354
00:22:42,033 --> 00:22:43,266
It's really good.

355
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,867
It's good.

356
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,000
It tastes amazing.

357
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,133
What do you want for dinner?

358
00:23:01,233 --> 00:23:03,166
I can make some steak. Beef steak?

359
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:05,567
- Okay.
- With some onions too.

360
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:06,834
- Wow.
- And butter?

361
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:08,467
Butter and garlic.

362
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,033
Tomorrow,

363
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,467
why don't we just have a lazy morning?

364
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:15,100
No boat riding. Just rest.

365
00:23:15,166 --> 00:23:17,000
Okay. Sounds good.

366
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,767
I was thinking maybe
we could do only dinner.

367
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,100
We only have three days.

368
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:25,266
After 7:30 PM, we don't get any orders.

369
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,433
No one comes to have dinner after that.

370
00:23:27,533 --> 00:23:29,166
Today was oddly busy.

371
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,100
I want to rest.

372
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,433
I don't want to eat.

373
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,834
I have no appetite.

374
00:23:41,633 --> 00:23:43,567
They look all drained.

375
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,734
We might have to close
for the lunch hour tomorrow.

376
00:23:46,734 --> 00:23:50,300
I think I should just let them sleep well
and laze around.

377
00:23:50,367 --> 00:23:52,100
- Just sleep well.
- Okay.

378
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,166
Do what you want.

379
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:55,166
- Okay!
- Thank you.

380
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,133
Since we're staying in a huge house,

381
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:58,667
let's play hide-and-seek?

382
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,033
Are we done with prep?

383
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,100
Wow, it's really fast.

384
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,867
- Is this pineappleade?
- Yes.

385
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,667
My first time trying pineappleade.

386
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,800
I'll ask the kids to try it too.

387
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:39,033
It's pineapple, your favorite.

388
00:24:39,133 --> 00:24:40,133
Gracias.

389
00:24:46,433 --> 00:24:47,834
All right, now…

390
00:24:49,433 --> 00:24:52,000
Shall we go back to frying chicken?

391
00:24:59,467 --> 00:25:00,633
Ready, go.

392
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,433
You look cute.

393
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:09,266
You look cute.

394
00:25:09,367 --> 00:25:10,367
I look cute?

395
00:25:20,333 --> 00:25:21,667
Are we ready now?

396
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:23,000
Can I open now?

397
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:24,500
- Yes.
- Yes.

398
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:26,100
- Yu Mi, I'll open.
- Okay.

399
00:25:51,734 --> 00:25:53,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

400
00:25:55,233 --> 00:25:56,567
You need to order here.

401
00:25:56,633 --> 00:25:57,867
Oh, okay.

402
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,667
Do you have any recommendations?

403
00:26:03,734 --> 00:26:04,667
Hmm…

404
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,266
Chicken rice is good.

405
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:08,867
It's our special for today.

406
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,033
Okay.

407
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,867
- If you're hungry.
- Yes.

408
00:26:13,066 --> 00:26:15,367
And this here, hellamyeon, is very spicy.

409
00:26:15,467 --> 00:26:17,400
- Oh, okay.
- Very spicy.

410
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,567
Mucho picante.

411
00:26:20,867 --> 00:26:22,900
We'll get these two then.

412
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,166
These two.

413
00:26:24,266 --> 00:26:25,533
- One each?
- Yes.

414
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,433
Hola.

415
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,133
- Good afternoon.
- This way.

416
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:36,633
Hey.

417
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,967
The rush has begun.

418
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:38,900
Really?

419
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:40,700
Two spicy frickens, please.

420
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,667
Two? Okay.

421
00:26:45,633 --> 00:26:46,633
Please take this.

422
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:48,233
Oh.

423
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:52,467
It means we already paid.

424
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:53,734
Oh, I see.

425
00:27:03,633 --> 00:27:05,567
Well done, Tae Hyung.

426
00:27:05,633 --> 00:27:06,734
Are you done?

427
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,100
I finished the half.

428
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:20,300
Our business is becoming successful,
but our morale is sagging.

429
00:27:23,867 --> 00:27:27,700
Just you wait until I make it as a singer.

430
00:27:30,934 --> 00:27:32,400
- Yu Mi.
- Yes?

431
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Is your dream still becoming an actress?

432
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:35,467
- Me?
- Yes.

433
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:37,767
- Right now, I have no dream.
- Why?

434
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:40,333
But you said you wanted to be an actress.

435
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:42,133
You wanted to be an actress.

436
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,233
- Seo Jun.
- Yes?

437
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,567
Is your dream to star in a Marvel movie?

438
00:27:45,633 --> 00:27:47,300
No.

439
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:48,333
What is it then?

440
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,934
The owner of this restaurant.

441
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,266
Thank you.

442
00:28:34,533 --> 00:28:36,166
A dog!

443
00:29:19,834 --> 00:29:21,000
- Tae Hyung.
- Yes?

444
00:29:21,066 --> 00:29:22,300
Try making hellamyeon.

445
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,300
Okay.

446
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:38,667
Nice.

447
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,467
Chibap is ready.

448
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:55,600
- Chibap?
- Yes!

449
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:58,467
Thank you.

450
00:29:58,533 --> 00:30:00,900
- That's the kimchi I talked about.
- Oh, kimchi.

451
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:03,233
Can I try it? How do you eat it?

452
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,900
- Just like this.
- With the rice?

453
00:30:04,967 --> 00:30:06,834
I think you just eat it.

454
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,667
I'm scared. Is it spicy?

455
00:30:15,266 --> 00:30:17,200
It's good food. It's very nutritious.

456
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,734
- Yeah?
- It has probiotics.

457
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:19,934
It's fermented.

458
00:30:20,433 --> 00:30:21,500
It tastes a bit sour.

459
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,100
It's really good. I like it.

460
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:38,433
It's really good.

461
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,266
I really like it.

462
00:30:40,934 --> 00:30:42,200
I'll take more later.

463
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,734
I don't want to eat it all at once
because I wanna try hellamyeon too.

464
00:30:45,834 --> 00:30:48,400
Right. That one's spicy.
We can eat it with this.

465
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:53,233
It's so good.

466
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:08,600
Chef, am I becoming a sous chef?

467
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:10,633
It depends.

468
00:31:18,266 --> 00:31:19,533
Pour it here.

469
00:31:19,633 --> 00:31:21,000
- Okay.
- Then…

470
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,667
Looks nice.

471
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,800
- Did you put the corn too?
- Yes.

472
00:31:38,867 --> 00:31:39,967
I watched you do it.

473
00:31:40,033 --> 00:31:41,033
Okay.

474
00:32:00,633 --> 00:32:02,233
- Thanks.
- Want chopsticks?

475
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,600
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

476
00:32:09,567 --> 00:32:10,834
It's spicy.

477
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,266
Is it?

478
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:13,767
Try it.

479
00:32:13,834 --> 00:32:15,133
Ooh, I'm nervous.

480
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:21,467
Right. It's spicy.

481
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,433
It's really spicy.

482
00:32:26,533 --> 00:32:28,033
Which makes it tasty though.

483
00:32:28,133 --> 00:32:29,233
But it's spicy.

484
00:32:30,667 --> 00:32:32,133
This is refreshing.

485
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:34,166
- It's gonna rain.
- It's gonna rain.

486
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:36,233
Turn around.

487
00:32:36,767 --> 00:32:37,834
Look at the sky.

488
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:56,300
Look how beautiful it is.

489
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,000
- It's so pretty.
- It's beautiful.

490
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:02,633
Cheers to us being here together.

491
00:33:06,433 --> 00:33:08,800
It's hot. Watch out.

492
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,300
Two chickens for the skyblue table.

493
00:33:40,533 --> 00:33:42,300
Thank you.

494
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:44,934
It smells savory.

495
00:33:50,066 --> 00:33:51,500
Oh, it's spicy.

496
00:33:52,333 --> 00:33:54,033
- Really?
- Spicy.

497
00:33:54,567 --> 00:33:55,734
Is it very spicy?

498
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,066
For me, yes.

499
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:00,800
It's not spicy.

500
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,000
For me, it is.

501
00:34:02,734 --> 00:34:03,800
It's tasty though.

502
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,333
- It's good.
- It's really good.

503
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:06,767
And a little sweet.

504
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:14,700
Mom.

505
00:34:14,767 --> 00:34:16,000
This is not jicama.

506
00:34:16,066 --> 00:34:17,667
- What?
- It's not jicama.

507
00:34:33,967 --> 00:34:35,066
Is it radish?

508
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:38,667
It must be Korean radish.

509
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:39,800
Yeah.

510
00:34:57,467 --> 00:34:58,467
Two?

511
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,500
Excuse me. The menu is here.

512
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,767
What do you feel like?

513
00:35:10,867 --> 00:35:13,100
I'd like to have one bulgogi gimbap and…

514
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,767
- Watermelon and pineapple, please.
- Okay.

515
00:35:22,433 --> 00:35:23,433
We got an order.

516
00:35:32,066 --> 00:35:33,266
Is the menu there?

517
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:35,066
It's over there.

518
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,734
I wanna have ramyeon.

519
00:35:44,834 --> 00:35:47,133
Let's order three of that.

520
00:35:47,166 --> 00:35:48,567
Three cheese ramyeons.

521
00:35:48,834 --> 00:35:50,066
Two...

522
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,200
And one mineral water.

523
00:35:52,467 --> 00:35:54,934
- Mineral water? Okay.
- Yes.

524
00:35:55,633 --> 00:35:56,633
We got an order.

525
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:59,667
Yu Mi, where should I put this?

526
00:35:59,734 --> 00:36:01,767
- Next to me.
- Here? In the middle?

527
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,467
- Woo Shik… Where's Woo Shik?
- For green.

528
00:36:09,533 --> 00:36:11,033
He's frying chicken here.

529
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:12,667
- Huh?
- He's frying chicken.

530
00:36:15,433 --> 00:36:16,734
I need him here now.

531
00:36:16,834 --> 00:36:17,867
Soon.

532
00:36:28,433 --> 00:36:29,433
Pineapple?

533
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,333
Thank you.

534
00:37:56,066 --> 00:37:57,700
- Should I just follow you?
- Yes.

535
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:22,133
Look here.

536
00:38:31,734 --> 00:38:34,300
- Do you need a baby chair?
- Yes, please.

537
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,900
- A baby chair?
- Yes, please.

538
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,400
A baby chair.

539
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:40,900
Oh, nice.

540
00:38:43,433 --> 00:38:44,467
Sorry.

541
00:38:47,734 --> 00:38:48,834
Thank you.

542
00:39:05,834 --> 00:39:06,767
Thank you.

543
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,433
Put your legs in.

544
00:39:14,734 --> 00:39:16,600
Bravo!

545
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,033
Say, "Hola."

546
00:39:30,433 --> 00:39:31,633
It's good.

547
00:39:51,567 --> 00:39:52,600
Itchy.

548
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:36,333
One second. It's for…

549
00:40:36,433 --> 00:40:38,266
- I know whose it is.
- Gray.

550
00:40:38,367 --> 00:40:40,367
Wait for the sauce.

551
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:41,633
- I'll do it.
- Thanks.

552
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:51,967
Gimbap?

553
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,066
Looks like we won't get to see him.

554
00:40:58,133 --> 00:41:00,834
I know. So slow down.

555
00:41:05,233 --> 00:41:07,300
- Guess what my husband said?
- Uh-huh.

556
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,533
He said I looked as happy
as I looked on my wedding day.

557
00:41:11,633 --> 00:41:12,934
So I looked at him.

558
00:41:13,033 --> 00:41:15,533
"No, this isn't comparable."

559
00:41:16,734 --> 00:41:18,300
He said, "What's with you?"

560
00:41:18,333 --> 00:41:21,400
I said this was something different.

561
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,400
It's a different kind of happiness.

562
00:41:31,533 --> 00:41:33,367
It's under the counter.

563
00:41:33,433 --> 00:41:34,300
Okay.

564
00:41:38,867 --> 00:41:40,600
There he is.

565
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:42,233
He's the guy I wanted to see.

566
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:44,633
It's him!

567
00:41:46,233 --> 00:41:47,533
He looks so beautiful.

568
00:41:47,633 --> 00:41:48,667
I finally saw him!

569
00:41:57,266 --> 00:41:59,400
Man, this radish is sour.

570
00:42:14,734 --> 00:42:16,166
Three cheese ramyeons?

571
00:42:18,567 --> 00:42:19,700
Oh, my gosh.

572
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,233
Hola.

573
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:45,333
How many?

574
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,800
- Just one.
- Just one.

575
00:42:46,867 --> 00:42:48,433
Could you wait a little bit?

576
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:50,467
How long do you think?

577
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:58,166
I don't know. Maybe 30 minutes?

578
00:42:58,967 --> 00:43:00,266
Can I get an order out?

579
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:02,734
Yes.

580
00:43:03,867 --> 00:43:05,633
How spicy is spicy fricken?

581
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,700
It's not that spicy.

582
00:43:08,066 --> 00:43:09,800
I'd like to get one of that and…

583
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,233
I'll go for the combo too.

584
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:14,633
- So those are for to-go, right?
- Yes.

585
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,533
- You can sit on the chair and wait.
- Sure, thank you.

586
00:43:18,734 --> 00:43:19,900
We got an order.

587
00:43:27,166 --> 00:43:31,967
Tae Hyung, could you fry the fritters
for the combo?

588
00:43:32,066 --> 00:43:33,700
The dumplings and laver rolls.

589
00:43:42,967 --> 00:43:45,600
Can I get a to-go box for chicken?

590
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:49,767
Thanks.

591
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,500
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

592
00:43:54,567 --> 00:43:56,000
- Let's do this.
- Let's go.

593
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,800
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

594
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,667
Could you put the fritters here?

595
00:43:59,734 --> 00:44:01,100
- Okay.
- And Tae Hyung.

596
00:44:01,233 --> 00:44:02,967
When you pack the chicken,

597
00:44:03,066 --> 00:44:04,200
use parchment paper.

598
00:44:04,233 --> 00:44:05,233
Okay.

599
00:44:34,767 --> 00:44:36,767
- Tae Hyung, I'm done.
- Okay.

600
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,633
You can put them here.

601
00:44:39,734 --> 00:44:42,066
- I'll turn on the stove.
- Okay.

602
00:44:58,333 --> 00:44:59,333
Three cheese ramyeons.

603
00:45:08,767 --> 00:45:09,767
Look.

604
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,734
Look at this.

605
00:45:14,834 --> 00:45:15,934
I'll give her some.

606
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,767
It'll be spicy for her.

607
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:39,600
It's okay.

608
00:45:48,934 --> 00:45:51,133
I thought it wouldn't be good with cheese.

609
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,433
It's good.

610
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:54,100
It's cheddar, right?

611
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,200
Gimbap for the to-go combo.

612
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,233
The sauce… It's here.

613
00:46:11,266 --> 00:46:12,567
Hey, the fritters ready.

614
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,567
- Oh, they're packed separately.
- Yes.

615
00:46:18,834 --> 00:46:21,066
Gimbap, tteokbokki, fritters.
They're all set.

616
00:46:21,166 --> 00:46:22,333
- All of them?
- Yes.

617
00:46:50,567 --> 00:46:52,333
Here you go. Thank you.

618
00:46:55,567 --> 00:46:56,834
- To-go menus?
- Served.

619
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,333
- Ramyeon?
- Served.

620
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,633
- So all done.
- Yes.

621
00:47:03,834 --> 00:47:05,133
- Do we have chicken?
- Huh?

622
00:47:05,166 --> 00:47:07,033
- Do we have chicken?
- I'll go check.

623
00:47:10,066 --> 00:47:12,033
Do we have three, four servings?

624
00:47:12,066 --> 00:47:13,333
- Four?
- Four.

625
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,700
We don't have much sauce.

626
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:02,600
- Two?
- Annyeong.

627
00:48:02,633 --> 00:48:03,834
Okay, table for two.

628
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,166
This is cute.

629
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:23,166
Excuse me. You should order here.

630
00:48:25,934 --> 00:48:28,900
I wanna have this. Gimbap.

631
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,633
I wanna order tuna gimbap.

632
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,900
Gimbap... with tuna?

633
00:48:35,934 --> 00:48:37,400
One red wine.

634
00:48:37,467 --> 00:48:38,367
One mineral water.

635
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,000
Please take this.

636
00:48:41,066 --> 00:48:42,166
Oh.

637
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:44,133
It's like a table number.

638
00:48:47,066 --> 00:48:49,000
Did we get it for our order?

639
00:48:49,066 --> 00:48:50,233
It's a table number.

640
00:48:51,834 --> 00:48:55,467
You know those things
restaurants give you that make sounds?

641
00:48:55,533 --> 00:48:58,734
It might vibrate like this.

642
00:49:03,967 --> 00:49:05,867
Thanks for coming again.

643
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:14,133
I should come back here tomorrow.

644
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,533
I wanted my mom to try your food too.

645
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,100
What do you wanna have?

646
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:22,767
This or that one?

647
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:23,834
That one.

648
00:49:24,300 --> 00:49:26,533
Is it very spicy as well?

649
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,700
Maybe. It depends.

650
00:49:28,767 --> 00:49:29,767
I don't like spicy.

651
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,367
Then you don't want it.

652
00:49:31,467 --> 00:49:32,567
This one is not spicy.

653
00:49:32,667 --> 00:49:33,900
Okay, this one then.

654
00:49:35,166 --> 00:49:36,700
I'll get this one and this.

655
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,767
Okay.

656
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:39,333
One watermelon juice.

657
00:49:39,533 --> 00:49:41,433
And for me, one red wine please.

658
00:49:41,533 --> 00:49:42,734
Like yesterday.

659
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:47,834
- Take this to your table.
- Okay. Thanks.

660
00:49:49,166 --> 00:49:50,300
We got an order.

661
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,800
On the top.

662
00:49:59,433 --> 00:50:01,100
Tuna gimbap…

663
00:50:09,166 --> 00:50:10,066
- Here?
- Yes.

664
00:50:51,367 --> 00:50:52,767
- Did you use gochujang?
- Yes.

665
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,533
- Tuna?
- Yes.

666
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,266
It looks nice.

667
00:51:23,333 --> 00:51:25,500
Yeah, I wanna try it too.

668
00:51:25,867 --> 00:51:27,967
Wow, it looks so yum.

669
00:51:33,533 --> 00:51:35,567
Do you like it? Is it spicy?

670
00:51:37,033 --> 00:51:41,867
It's really good.
The sauce is tasty, but too spicy for me.

671
00:51:42,266 --> 00:51:44,100
- Corn dog.
- Thank you.

672
00:51:50,033 --> 00:51:51,033
It's so good.

673
00:51:52,633 --> 00:51:53,800
It tastes like churros.

674
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,700
Would you like to try it?
It's really good.

675
00:52:01,166 --> 00:52:02,533
I think you'll like it.

676
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:13,300
Yours is really good too.

677
00:52:14,233 --> 00:52:15,633
Do you like it?

678
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:18,400
You always liked sweet and salty.

679
00:52:24,467 --> 00:52:25,600
It's very good.

680
00:52:27,834 --> 00:52:30,000
Oh, this is him.

681
00:52:32,033 --> 00:52:33,900
The dimples are the same.

682
00:52:39,333 --> 00:52:41,567
I'll make one chicken
as you make the sauce.

683
00:52:41,633 --> 00:52:42,600
Okay.

684
00:52:42,667 --> 00:52:45,700
Nice, Tae Hyung. Squeeze it in.

685
00:52:56,467 --> 00:52:58,567
Imagine we suddenly run out of sauce.

686
00:52:58,600 --> 00:52:59,967
I'd freak out.

687
00:53:27,567 --> 00:53:30,400
- Bulgogi gimbap.
- It's for the bronze table.

688
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,967
- Okay.
- Serve it with sauce.

689
00:53:40,033 --> 00:53:41,100
- Gimbap?
- Yes.

690
00:53:42,934 --> 00:53:43,967
Chicken?

691
00:53:45,333 --> 00:53:50,066
And...
Could we have one more of each, please?

692
00:53:50,133 --> 00:53:52,233
One more gimbap and one more chicken?

693
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,900
- For to-go.
- Oh, to-go.

694
00:53:53,967 --> 00:53:55,433
For my husband.

695
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:07,333
Mmm!

696
00:54:08,367 --> 00:54:10,166
It's so good. It's not spicy at all.

697
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,633
Thanks for getting me this delicious food.

698
00:54:18,266 --> 00:54:21,000
Let's try it now.

699
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,734
Let's see if you like it.

700
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,033
Mmm.

701
00:54:30,333 --> 00:54:31,700
It's really good.

702
00:54:32,867 --> 00:54:38,166
In a way,
this is a light food made with rice.

703
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,033
Right, it's light.

704
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:42,367
And nutritious.

705
00:54:42,467 --> 00:54:47,734
They put rice on the laver
and then more laver.

706
00:55:07,266 --> 00:55:09,100
It's so delicious.

707
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:13,567
Will the corn dog be spicy?

708
00:55:13,667 --> 00:55:15,767
Yes, I think that one will be better.

709
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:18,533
- One corn dog, please.
- One?

710
00:55:22,333 --> 00:55:23,367
We got an order.

711
00:56:03,967 --> 00:56:06,734
Good idea to watch corn dogs.
Smart decision.

712
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,066
Smart decision.

713
00:56:08,133 --> 00:56:09,300
This is good.

714
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:10,867
It means we're becoming a team.

715
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:12,300
It's like a through pass.

716
00:56:14,767 --> 00:56:15,767
You're cute.

717
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:19,867
- Tae Hyung.
- Yes?

718
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:21,567
Make yourself irreplaceable.

719
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:23,166
I already am.

720
00:56:23,233 --> 00:56:24,266
Not yet.

721
00:56:28,934 --> 00:56:30,633
- Here's the food.
- Okay.

722
00:56:37,734 --> 00:56:38,900
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

723
00:56:38,967 --> 00:56:42,166
It looks amazing!

724
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:46,567
Yours look incredible.

725
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:56,500
It's really good.

726
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,567
Should we order one for to-go?

727
00:57:00,433 --> 00:57:01,433
Sure.

728
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,166
- For to-go.
- Okay.

729
00:57:04,166 --> 00:57:05,934
- And...
- Just one corn dog?

730
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,734
Hello, I'll put it right here.

731
00:57:16,767 --> 00:57:18,467
I think they have seats there.

732
00:57:18,567 --> 00:57:19,400
How many?

733
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,700
Three.

734
00:57:20,734 --> 00:57:22,533
We have a small table. Is it okay?

735
00:57:27,033 --> 00:57:28,500
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

736
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,066
It was amazing. Thanks, my love.

737
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,600
Hey.

738
00:57:37,834 --> 00:57:41,300
It's for our memories.

739
00:57:42,867 --> 00:57:43,934
Are you finished?

740
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,133
Yes, it was amazing.

741
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:49,266
Your Spanish is good.

742
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:52,100
Guapo. Bonito… Bonita?

743
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,934
- Bonita.
- Bonita.

744
00:57:54,033 --> 00:57:57,000
I'm ugly and she's very pretty.

745
00:57:57,100 --> 00:57:58,567
Very, very.

746
00:58:05,867 --> 00:58:07,600
Let's go to our baby.

747
00:58:14,233 --> 00:58:16,367
There's gimbap.

748
00:58:16,433 --> 00:58:17,633
What's this? Bulgogi?

749
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:18,700
This one looks good.

750
00:58:18,767 --> 00:58:21,467
I'll order a corn dog.
It doesn't look spicy.

751
00:58:22,734 --> 00:58:23,934
One bulgogi gimbap?

752
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,300
And... I want this.

753
00:58:27,667 --> 00:58:29,133
- A cheese ramyeon?
- Yes.

754
00:58:38,066 --> 00:58:40,266
I'm so nervous about the English exam.

755
00:58:40,266 --> 00:58:42,133
I have an assignment to do too.

756
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,967
There are tons of things to do,
but I haven't done any.

757
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,033
Same here. I need to study and all, but…

758
00:58:51,734 --> 00:58:53,300
- Coke?
- Thank you.

759
00:58:57,734 --> 00:58:58,734
Cheers.

760
00:58:58,967 --> 00:58:59,967
Cheers.

761
00:59:01,266 --> 00:59:02,266
I'm happy.

762
00:59:02,367 --> 00:59:04,100
I'm satisfied now.

763
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,667
- An order.
- Okay.

764
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:14,300
Can we make more bulgogi gimbap?

765
00:59:14,333 --> 00:59:15,533
Only one.

766
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,033
- One? That's it?
- Yes.

767
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,333
- No more?
- No.

768
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,133
- Okay.
- We ran out of bulgogi.

769
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:22,133
Chicken…

770
00:59:22,133 --> 00:59:24,033
Only one serving of chicken left.

771
00:59:24,633 --> 00:59:26,300
Seo Jin.

772
00:59:26,367 --> 00:59:28,533
We have about 1.5 serving of chicken left.

773
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:29,500
So one serving.

774
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,000
Yes. We can do one chicken and one chibap.

775
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:33,000
Okay.

776
00:59:39,967 --> 00:59:44,000
I think our store closes
when we run out of chicken.

777
00:59:44,066 --> 00:59:46,834
We should try to sell chicken fast.

778
00:59:54,467 --> 00:59:57,166
- Oh, we got more pickled radish.
- Yes.

779
00:59:57,233 --> 00:59:58,567
All right.

780
00:59:58,633 --> 00:59:59,867
Let's go!

781
00:59:59,934 --> 01:00:01,200
Drain the juice.

782
01:00:06,166 --> 01:00:07,400
- What you doing?
- What?

783
01:00:19,867 --> 01:00:21,233
Drain the juice.

784
01:00:21,867 --> 01:00:23,033
Juice all drained.

785
01:00:25,533 --> 01:00:26,533
All right.

786
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,800
- Corn dog?
- Yes!

787
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:51,000
- Thank you.
- What is it?

788
01:00:51,066 --> 01:00:51,934
Wanna try it?

789
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,100
When I get my food.

790
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:55,000
I'll wait.

791
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,233
- Thank you.
- Sure.

792
01:01:01,734 --> 01:01:03,934
Should we try the food at the same time?

793
01:01:08,066 --> 01:01:09,133
Just a second.

794
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:20,800
It's so good. Try it.

795
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:24,266
Try with the cheese.

796
01:01:24,967 --> 01:01:26,033
It's really good.

797
01:01:30,433 --> 01:01:32,367
- Do you like it?
- It's good.

798
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,600
I love it.

799
01:01:43,767 --> 01:01:46,367
It can be strange at first,
but it's tasty.

800
01:01:57,266 --> 01:01:59,033
Thank you.

801
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:01,700
It's sweet.

802
01:02:11,433 --> 01:02:13,166
What is it?

803
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:14,667
I don't know.

804
01:02:14,734 --> 01:02:15,900
What is this?

805
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:18,700
It's sticky rice with honey.

806
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,900
It's a little sweet.

807
01:02:20,633 --> 01:02:22,166
Rice and honey?

808
01:02:22,266 --> 01:02:23,533
Yes.

809
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,133
Hi, ma'am.

810
01:02:26,934 --> 01:02:28,066
Did you like the food?

811
01:02:28,166 --> 01:02:29,900
It's so good, isn't it?

812
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:35,900
I came here yesterday,
and all their food is tasty.

813
01:02:35,967 --> 01:02:37,633
So I brought my mom today.

814
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:39,533
Oh, she's visiting.

815
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,567
She's visiting, yes.

816
01:02:41,633 --> 01:02:43,633
She's leaving now.

817
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,667
To a big city.

818
01:02:45,734 --> 01:02:47,967
She doesn't like peaceful Bacalar.

819
01:02:49,834 --> 01:02:52,000
She could use a little bit of noise.

820
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:53,567
Just visiting is nice too.

821
01:02:53,667 --> 01:02:55,867
This place is so beautiful.

822
01:03:02,734 --> 01:03:04,834
- I think there will be no more.
- No.

823
01:03:04,834 --> 01:03:06,200
- Right?
- Should we close?

824
01:03:07,233 --> 01:03:08,400
What time is it now?

825
01:03:08,467 --> 01:03:09,667
It's past 7 PM.

826
01:03:09,700 --> 01:03:11,400
Aren't we closed at seven?

827
01:03:11,433 --> 01:03:14,333
We're taking half a day off,
so I'm gonna close at 7:30 PM.

828
01:03:18,667 --> 01:03:22,367
Sir, when are we taking the last order?

829
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,367
- We're taking a half day off tomorrow, so…
- Your dimples…

830
01:03:25,467 --> 01:03:27,500
I was going to open for a little longer,

831
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,967
but we're running out of ingredients
for bulgogi gimbap and chicken.

832
01:03:31,066 --> 01:03:33,834
Also, I think we won't get
any more customers.

833
01:03:33,934 --> 01:03:35,667
So I was thinking of closing soon.

834
01:03:35,767 --> 01:03:37,500
This is it then?

835
01:03:37,567 --> 01:03:38,967
- Stop?
- No more customers.

836
01:03:38,967 --> 01:03:40,166
So we stop here?

837
01:03:40,166 --> 01:03:41,433
Goodness.

838
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,567
I have a feeling we hit 10,000 again.

839
01:03:44,266 --> 01:03:45,734
- Are we closing?
- Yes.

840
01:03:51,266 --> 01:03:52,200
Good night.

841
01:04:03,967 --> 01:04:04,867
Good work today.

842
01:04:07,467 --> 01:04:08,467
Good work.

843
01:04:11,433 --> 01:04:12,367
Gosh, my legs.

844
01:04:17,867 --> 01:04:20,567
Now, I'm starting to forget
what my job was.

845
01:04:20,633 --> 01:04:23,266
I literally used up all my energy.

846
01:04:23,333 --> 01:04:25,500
I thought that expression was

847
01:04:25,567 --> 01:04:28,266
a perfect expression for concerts.

848
01:04:28,333 --> 01:04:29,300
Yes?

849
01:04:29,367 --> 01:04:30,533
But I was wrong.

850
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:31,800
- It's for today?
- Yes.

851
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:34,367
- I used up all my energy.
- You do look pale.

852
01:04:34,834 --> 01:04:35,700
Seriously.

853
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:38,934
So this is what they say
using up all energy is like.

854
01:04:39,033 --> 01:04:40,266
People also say,

855
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,433
"I feel like my eyes are popping out."

856
01:04:43,500 --> 01:04:45,033
Mine popped out already.

857
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:46,333
So I put them back.

858
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:49,900
My dark circles hurt.

859
01:04:49,967 --> 01:04:51,400
- Your dark circles?
- Yes.

860
01:05:05,266 --> 01:05:06,567
Come on. Speed up.

861
01:05:07,834 --> 01:05:10,166
You seem very interested
in sales these days.

862
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,000
I think we'll hit 15,000 even.

863
01:05:14,967 --> 01:05:15,900
Oh, not yet.

864
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:22,300
We should get one or two more groups.

865
01:05:22,367 --> 01:05:23,266
- Hey.
- Yes?

866
01:05:23,266 --> 01:05:24,500
I'll tell the kids.

867
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,900
- We hit 10,000 pesos.
- How much?

868
01:05:28,967 --> 01:05:30,166
It's 11,000 something.

869
01:05:30,233 --> 01:05:31,133
We hit the number?

870
01:05:31,166 --> 01:05:32,734
- What number? 10,000?
- Yes.

871
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:33,967
Of course.

872
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,066
Calculate it.

873
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,333
- Did you hear?
- What?

874
01:05:39,400 --> 01:05:40,367
We hit 10,000.

875
01:05:40,467 --> 01:05:42,467
I'm sure word is getting around.

876
01:05:42,600 --> 01:05:44,400
But having many customers is tiring.

877
01:05:47,834 --> 01:05:48,967
This is crazy.

878
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,033
It was delicious.

879
01:06:21,133 --> 01:06:22,333
Gracias.

880
01:06:23,233 --> 01:06:24,300
Thank you very much.

881
01:06:24,367 --> 01:06:26,033
Thank you.

882
01:06:26,467 --> 01:06:28,900
I'm going to Mérida tomorrow.

883
01:06:28,967 --> 01:06:30,667
So you're not coming tomorrow?

884
01:06:37,166 --> 01:06:38,100
Bye-bye.

885
01:06:38,633 --> 01:06:41,400
- Thank you.
- Buenas noches.

886
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,033
Adiós.

887
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,066
It's over.

888
01:06:50,667 --> 01:06:51,867
It's over.

889
01:06:51,967 --> 01:06:53,033
Hey, Woo Shik.

890
01:06:55,233 --> 01:06:56,400
The tip.

891
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:57,533
Thank you.

892
01:06:58,967 --> 01:06:59,767
Here.

893
01:07:01,133 --> 01:07:02,734
- I'll get the glasses.
- Okay.

894
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,800
- Leave the glasses.
- Okay.

895
01:07:12,233 --> 01:07:13,533
The glasses and cans.

896
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:15,800
- Woo Shik.
- Yes?

897
01:07:15,867 --> 01:07:17,767
- Here.
- Huh?

898
01:07:17,867 --> 01:07:19,400
You said the tips were for me.

899
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:21,400
Woo Shik isn't well today.

900
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:23,000
Let Woo Shik have it today.

901
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:24,633
- Just today then.
- Okay.

902
01:07:24,734 --> 01:07:25,834
- Understand?
- Yes.

903
01:07:25,934 --> 01:07:26,900
Nice.

904
01:07:28,433 --> 01:07:30,266
Good work today, chef.

905
01:07:30,333 --> 01:07:32,867
- Good work.
- Good work, Intern Kim.

906
01:07:32,934 --> 01:07:35,400
Wait, wasn't I a sous chef now?

907
01:07:35,467 --> 01:07:36,767
I need a few more days.

908
01:07:44,934 --> 01:07:46,066
Good work, guys.

909
01:07:46,133 --> 01:07:47,600
- Good work.
- Let's go home.

910
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:48,667
Let's go home.

911
01:07:53,767 --> 01:07:54,734
Let's go home.

912
01:07:56,967 --> 01:07:57,867
Goodness.

913
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,166
- Great work, guys.
- Great work.

914
01:08:03,266 --> 01:08:05,000
- Well done.
- Very well done.

915
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,000
I wanna jump into the pool first.

916
01:08:08,066 --> 01:08:10,767
I wanna splash the water in the pool.

917
01:08:10,834 --> 01:08:12,467
- Don't slash the water.
- What?

918
01:08:12,533 --> 01:08:13,667
Splash the water.

919
01:08:14,767 --> 01:08:16,633
Why are there so many people there?

920
01:08:16,700 --> 01:08:19,133
Today was the busiest day ever.

921
01:08:19,200 --> 01:08:20,967
We're already so busy.

922
01:08:21,033 --> 01:08:23,600
- We only have two days left.
- We have two days left.

923
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,133
Let's stay a little longer.

924
01:08:25,233 --> 01:08:27,500
Didn't you say you were dead tired?

925
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:30,934
My body is too tired to move,
but my heart says I should.

926
01:08:31,033 --> 01:08:33,367
I told you. My Achilles sores so much.

927
01:08:33,467 --> 01:08:35,900
Starting tomorrow,
sing instead of just chanting.

928
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,266
- Something like, "Let's go, Yankees".
- Right.

929
01:08:38,333 --> 01:08:39,567
Or "Let's go Dodgers".

930
01:08:39,633 --> 01:08:42,200
Go Seo Jin, go Seo Jin

931
01:08:42,233 --> 01:08:44,767
Go, go, go, Seo Jin

932
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:48,633
Go, go, go, Seo Jin, go Seo Jin

933
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,400
Go, go, go, Seo Jin

934
01:08:51,467 --> 01:08:54,400
Go Seo Jin, go Seo Jin

935
01:08:54,467 --> 01:08:56,700
Shake your booty like Seo Jin

936
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,700
Go Yu Mi, go Yu Mi

937
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:03,000
Be quiet.

938
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:07,667
Could you get the gray shirt ready
when we get home?

939
01:09:07,734 --> 01:09:09,700
I thought we were wearing white.

940
01:09:09,967 --> 01:09:10,867
No-uniform day.

941
01:09:10,934 --> 01:09:12,166
You know what it is.

942
01:09:12,233 --> 01:09:14,066
The clothes Tae Hyung bought.

943
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:21,133
Should we pick ours?

944
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,967
- I already did.
- I'll wear the one

945
01:09:22,967 --> 01:09:24,333
that nobody picked.

946
01:09:24,367 --> 01:09:26,333
Don't give him the one with stripes.

947
01:09:26,333 --> 01:09:28,000
What's that?

948
01:09:28,066 --> 01:09:29,066
This must be yours.

949
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:33,600
We won't get customers tomorrow.

950
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:35,400
- Tae Hyung should wear it.
- Okay.

951
01:09:43,133 --> 01:09:45,900
Leave it, Seo Jin. I'll open it.

952
01:09:45,967 --> 01:09:47,700
Just sit there.

953
01:09:47,767 --> 01:09:48,700
I'll walk home.

954
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:49,900
- Just sit.
- Stay.

955
01:09:49,967 --> 01:09:52,000
- I'll walk home.
- Just stay seated.

956
01:10:06,467 --> 01:10:07,767
Good job, guys.

957
01:10:24,133 --> 01:10:26,300
Is there something to celebrate?

958
01:10:26,367 --> 01:10:28,467
No, we're not celebrating anything.

959
01:10:29,967 --> 01:10:32,200
We always hit 10,000,

960
01:10:32,266 --> 01:10:34,100
so it's nothing to celebrate now.

961
01:10:35,166 --> 01:10:36,300
It's normal.

962
01:10:46,967 --> 01:10:48,100
Oh, it's getting hot.

963
01:10:50,033 --> 01:10:51,934
- There's no smoke?
- Nope.

964
01:10:56,266 --> 01:10:57,567
Wow, it looks delicious.

965
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,834
It's tasty.

966
01:11:04,066 --> 01:11:04,934
Yeah.

967
01:11:07,567 --> 01:11:08,567
It's good.

968
01:11:08,633 --> 01:11:09,667
- Right?
- Yes.

969
01:11:12,233 --> 01:11:14,633
- Tae Hyung, are you making ramyeon?
- Yes.

970
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:22,934
Oops.

971
01:11:42,233 --> 01:11:43,967
You really love it, don't you?

972
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:47,000
He really loves noodles.

973
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:49,800
Whenever I call him,

974
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:52,000
he's always eating jjajangmyeon.

975
01:11:52,533 --> 01:11:53,967
He eats makguksu these days.

976
01:11:54,066 --> 01:11:55,800
- Wait, we have makguksu.
- Right.

977
01:11:55,900 --> 01:11:57,266
Want it for lunch tomorrow?

978
01:12:02,567 --> 01:12:05,133
Let's say we go to work
at 3 PM tomorrow.

979
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:07,367
We have only two days left,

980
01:12:07,433 --> 01:12:10,300
so I was thinking about adding menus
like spicy pork rice.

981
01:12:10,467 --> 01:12:14,667
When I was stir-frying bulgogi earlier,

982
01:12:14,734 --> 01:12:17,266
it smelled like bulgogi stew.

983
01:12:17,367 --> 01:12:18,533
It's like bulgogi stew.

984
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:19,767
- With onions…
- Right.

985
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:20,700
and other stuff…

986
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:24,066
We just need to add carrots and onions.

987
01:12:24,633 --> 01:12:26,834
- I wanna remove the tteokbokki menu.
- Me too.

988
01:12:26,934 --> 01:12:29,400
Then we should take out Combo B too.

989
01:12:29,433 --> 01:12:31,200
Should we get rid of combo menus?

990
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:32,934
To be honest, I think we should.

991
01:12:32,967 --> 01:12:34,967
- Let's remove Combo A and B.
- Yes.

992
01:12:35,033 --> 01:12:36,300
Should we add rice menus?

993
01:12:41,633 --> 01:12:44,233
Yu Mi, do you wanna do both menus or…

994
01:12:44,266 --> 01:12:46,200
We're almost done, so I'll do both.

995
01:12:47,700 --> 01:12:51,066
Go Yu Mi, go Yu Mi

996
01:12:51,166 --> 01:12:54,600
Well, we don't know
which one will sell better, so…

997
01:13:03,767 --> 01:13:05,200
Seo Jin, in case you wonder,

998
01:13:05,266 --> 01:13:07,333
I make three menus now.

999
01:13:08,033 --> 01:13:09,567
Oh, really?

1000
01:13:09,633 --> 01:13:12,767
I'm now about to be a sous chef.

1001
01:13:12,834 --> 01:13:15,133
I'm just waiting
for the chef to confirm it.

1002
01:13:15,934 --> 01:13:17,900
I'm a soon-to-be sous chef.

1003
01:13:17,967 --> 01:13:19,934
What about in the service team?

1004
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,667
Isn't it about time
he's promoted to a manager?

1005
01:13:22,734 --> 01:13:23,600
Woo Shik?

1006
01:13:23,633 --> 01:13:26,066
You can't get promoted
in the middle of the show.

1007
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:28,867
But we can't do anything
in the dining area without him.

1008
01:13:33,900 --> 01:13:37,166
Go Woo Shik, go Woo Shik, go, go

1009
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,900
Woo Shik is under me

1010
01:13:39,967 --> 01:13:42,367
and Tae Hyung is under Seo Jun.

1011
01:13:43,166 --> 01:13:44,533
Then who is she under?

1012
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:45,867
There's no one over me.

1013
01:13:46,967 --> 01:13:49,633
You grated the carrots
really nicely today.

1014
01:13:49,700 --> 01:13:52,500
- Today's carrot was amazing.
- Is that so?

1015
01:13:52,567 --> 01:13:55,934
You see, grating may
not look like a special job,

1016
01:13:55,934 --> 01:13:57,700
- It's hard.
- but this feels so good.

1017
01:13:58,266 --> 01:14:01,300
Today, the carrots
stuck together so nicely.

1018
01:14:02,066 --> 01:14:03,266
They didn't fall apart.

1019
01:14:04,133 --> 01:14:05,934
I'm not lying.

1020
01:14:06,033 --> 01:14:07,500
See yourself tomorrow.

1021
01:14:07,533 --> 01:14:08,633
Okay.

1022
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:11,033
Saturday will be our highest sales day.

1023
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:11,967
Certainly.

1024
01:14:12,033 --> 01:14:13,734
On our last day here,

1025
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:15,967
we shouldn't take a break.

1026
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,100
Then we'll have to prep a lot.

1027
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:20,734
We'll have to fry
a crazy amount of chicken.

1028
01:14:20,800 --> 01:14:22,667
Since it's our last day,

1029
01:14:22,700 --> 01:14:24,834
start frying three hours in advance.

1030
01:14:24,867 --> 01:14:26,233
- Three hours?
- What?

1031
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:27,867
Well, Woo Shik can actually…

1032
01:14:27,867 --> 01:14:29,834
- fry the chicken fast now.
- He's fast.

1033
01:14:29,834 --> 01:14:31,500
He was really fast today.

1034
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:34,533
He doesn't splatter oil everywhere.
He's so clean.

1035
01:14:34,633 --> 01:14:38,133
Right. He shouldn't be sick.
We should keep him in shape.

1036
01:14:38,233 --> 01:14:41,200
If he gets sick,
we can't do anything here.

1037
01:14:42,033 --> 01:14:45,066
So we're not having any break
on our last day.

1038
01:14:47,333 --> 01:14:48,767
Tae Hyung, why?

1039
01:14:48,834 --> 01:14:50,900
It was Seo Jun's suggestion.

1040
01:14:50,967 --> 01:14:53,266
Snap out of it.

1041
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:57,033
- Without break time.
- Well, on our last day,

1042
01:14:57,100 --> 01:15:00,633
- we can just work nonstop--
- Tae Hyung, I respect your opinions,

1043
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:03,834
but we've gotta give it our all
on the last day.

1044
01:15:03,934 --> 01:15:06,667
We should start frying chicken
three hours in advance.

1045
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:44,567
Good morning.

1046
01:15:48,033 --> 01:15:49,100
I want this.

1047
01:16:10,033 --> 01:16:10,934
He's just…

1048
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:13,100
Don't you think you're eating too much?

1049
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:14,400
Me?

1050
01:16:16,734 --> 01:16:18,533
- Is it your second box?
- Yes.

1051
01:16:18,633 --> 01:16:20,333
He's eating two boxes of cereal.

1052
01:16:20,433 --> 01:16:21,900
I'm in trouble.

1053
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:25,667
I need to lose lots of weight.

1054
01:16:25,734 --> 01:16:28,333
I'm gonna weigh myself back in Korea.

1055
01:16:28,367 --> 01:16:30,133
I think I'll weigh at least 70kg.

1056
01:16:36,333 --> 01:16:39,600
Everyone is coming out at this hour.

1057
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:41,767
What time is it?

1058
01:16:41,834 --> 01:16:43,867
Now? 12:30 PM.

1059
01:16:43,967 --> 01:16:45,900
Seo Jin, what do we have for lunch?

1060
01:16:45,934 --> 01:16:48,500
- We'll eat makguksu.
- With perilla oil, right?

1061
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:49,700
I love it.

1062
01:16:51,367 --> 01:16:53,033
Let's have makguksu.

1063
01:17:05,433 --> 01:17:07,600
Let's put four of these
and the leftovers.

1064
01:17:33,867 --> 01:17:35,400
How many should we cook?

1065
01:17:35,467 --> 01:17:37,500
Five, of course. We're five people.

1066
01:17:37,567 --> 01:17:40,200
Then after one hour,
we'll get hungry again.

1067
01:17:40,266 --> 01:17:41,867
I can finish it all at once.

1068
01:17:41,934 --> 01:17:43,667
No, they're noodles.

1069
01:17:46,133 --> 01:17:47,533
I'll open all of them.

1070
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:53,266
We can't finish them all.

1071
01:18:02,133 --> 01:18:03,333
Maybe it's too much.

1072
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:05,800
I told you it's too much.
Use only 6 packs.

1073
01:18:05,867 --> 01:18:08,367
Just 6 packs.
I'm telling you. It'll be a lot.

1074
01:18:08,433 --> 01:18:09,800
Tae Hyung loves noodles.

1075
01:18:09,867 --> 01:18:11,567
But we just woke up.

1076
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:24,834
How about one ramyeon?

1077
01:18:24,934 --> 01:18:26,200
Just one then?

1078
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:27,200
I'll make it.

1079
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:28,900
You're going to make ramyeon?

1080
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:30,266
You guys are crazy.

1081
01:18:30,367 --> 01:18:33,033
Yu Mi, you want to eat
both ramyeon and makguksu?

1082
01:18:33,133 --> 01:18:34,767
No, never mind.

1083
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:52,734
Mmm!

1084
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,033
It's good.

1085
01:19:12,734 --> 01:19:14,367
I'm so full now.

1086
01:19:16,133 --> 01:19:17,100
The egg yolk?

1087
01:19:17,166 --> 01:19:19,567
- What?
- Aren't you eating the egg yolk?

1088
01:19:19,633 --> 01:19:21,100
- No.
- Why?

1089
01:19:21,166 --> 01:19:23,300
Because it has no protein.

1090
01:19:23,367 --> 01:19:25,433
Egg yolks have protein too.

1091
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:27,600
You need it when you work.

1092
01:19:27,667 --> 01:19:29,867
You should eat it when you're active.

1093
01:19:29,934 --> 01:19:32,233
An egg has only 3g of protein.

1094
01:19:33,033 --> 01:19:35,200
Wasn't it 6g?

1095
01:19:35,834 --> 01:19:37,500
But you don't eat it every day.

1096
01:19:41,133 --> 01:19:43,066
You said you wouldn't eat it.

1097
01:19:43,433 --> 01:19:44,433
I felt pressured.

1098
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:50,100
What about the jet ski?

1099
01:19:50,166 --> 01:19:52,400
- Tae Hyung is gonna ride it.
- Alone?

1100
01:19:52,433 --> 01:19:54,367
If there is more than one, I'll join.

1101
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:56,934
I'll go buy the chicken.

1102
01:19:57,467 --> 01:19:58,333
Really?

1103
01:19:58,467 --> 01:19:59,900
Okay.

1104
01:20:00,133 --> 01:20:02,367
But make sure we can leave here by 3 PM.

1105
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,000
Oh, it's here.

1106
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:17,533
It's here. Yay! I wanna go too.

1107
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,333
- We got two.
- Two jet skis. Let's go.

1108
01:20:21,266 --> 01:20:24,233
After this,
I think I'm gonna be really motivated.

1109
01:20:25,066 --> 01:20:26,934
You might use all your energy there.

1110
01:20:33,233 --> 01:20:34,266
Young energy.

1111
01:20:36,033 --> 01:20:37,400
Yes!

1112
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,600
Let's go!

1113
01:20:39,700 --> 01:20:42,166
- Should I ride it too?
- Let's go!

1114
01:20:47,266 --> 01:20:49,300
Hey, hey!

1115
01:20:52,700 --> 01:20:54,667
Oh, no. It's so fast.

1116
01:20:56,467 --> 01:20:58,767
This is youth!

1117
01:21:35,533 --> 01:21:36,567
- Let's go.
- Go!

1118
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:37,667
- Here we go!
- Go!

1119
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,400
Three pineapples.

1120
01:22:40,233 --> 01:22:41,800
Three.

1121
01:22:43,233 --> 01:22:46,433
This company is pretty good.
The boss works while the staff play.

1122
01:22:50,166 --> 01:22:53,967
They say they're so tired, but all they
think about is playing. Unbelievable.

1123
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:16,166
Hey, we should go to work soon.

1124
01:23:16,233 --> 01:23:18,333
What time is it now?

1125
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,533
Now?

1126
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,200
We've got a few minutes left.

1127
01:23:22,200 --> 01:23:23,367
We should wash up.

1128
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,200
Here we go.

1129
01:23:26,300 --> 01:23:27,166
Where's our house?

1130
01:23:27,233 --> 01:23:28,567
- What?
- Where's our house?

1131
01:23:37,200 --> 01:23:39,333
- Where are my sunglasses?
- Your sunglasses?

1132
01:23:39,367 --> 01:23:40,934
The wind must've blown it away.

1133
01:23:46,667 --> 01:23:48,800
- Are we wearing these today?
- Yes.

1134
01:23:50,700 --> 01:23:52,533
Where are men's clothes?

1135
01:23:56,734 --> 01:23:58,967
What trousers should we wear with these?

1136
01:23:59,066 --> 01:24:00,100
Anything you like.

1137
01:24:00,200 --> 01:24:01,567
- Of any color?
- Yes.

1138
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:04,133
Why did he buy these?

1139
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:12,500
It does look nice.

1140
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:14,000
Come on.

1141
01:24:16,367 --> 01:24:20,100
The staff had a great time

1142
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:23,233
while you went to buy the chicken.

1143
01:24:23,300 --> 01:24:25,600
Are you leading by example?

1144
01:24:26,967 --> 01:24:28,834
Well, I need to coax them somehow

1145
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:30,266
to work for two more days.

1146
01:24:35,300 --> 01:24:37,333
Do you feel bad about the staff

1147
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:38,867
not reserving their energy?

1148
01:24:38,934 --> 01:24:40,300
Well, the kids

1149
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,700
would want to do
the opposite of what I say.

1150
01:24:43,867 --> 01:24:45,333
So I should let them be.

1151
01:24:45,433 --> 01:24:48,000
So they won't complain later.

1152
01:24:48,100 --> 01:24:50,233
So they won't say they're tired and all.

1153
01:24:50,233 --> 01:24:52,600
Woo Shik hasn't been good since yesterday.

1154
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:55,000
He's been working hard
as soon as he arrived.

1155
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:57,033
I heard he made four rounds.

1156
01:24:57,100 --> 01:24:58,300
On the jet ski.

1157
01:24:59,667 --> 01:25:01,400
He must've lost his mind.

1158
01:25:02,734 --> 01:25:04,633
He thinks he's here to play.

1159
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:07,033
He seemed well today, by the way.

1160
01:25:07,166 --> 01:25:08,467
Woo Shik is fine.

1161
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:12,200
Today, he can't say he's tired.
After making four rounds,

1162
01:25:12,233 --> 01:25:13,367
he can't say that.

1163
01:25:14,467 --> 01:25:17,567
You don't seem tired.

1164
01:25:18,033 --> 01:25:19,867
Woo Shik, you seem energized now.

1165
01:25:20,266 --> 01:25:22,333
- I feel good.
- Good to work until 9 PM?

1166
01:25:22,367 --> 01:25:23,200
Yes.

1167
01:25:23,300 --> 01:25:25,233
- Right?
- Yes. Yesterday,

1168
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:27,200
I lost enthusiasm.

1169
01:25:27,266 --> 01:25:28,300
- Right?
- Yes.

1170
01:25:29,233 --> 01:25:32,967
I think I got my smile back today.

1171
01:25:33,166 --> 01:25:34,800
Let's open at 1 PM tomorrow.

1172
01:25:34,900 --> 01:25:35,967
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

1173
01:25:36,166 --> 01:25:37,100
At 1 PM...

1174
01:25:38,667 --> 01:25:40,033
And close when?

1175
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:41,300
At 9 PM.

1176
01:25:41,367 --> 01:25:43,266
- At 9 PM?
- Yes.

1177
01:25:43,333 --> 01:25:44,767
Well…

1178
01:25:44,834 --> 01:25:48,633
I'd love to, but I'm not sure
what others will say.

1179
01:25:48,734 --> 01:25:51,300
Then convince them.

1180
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,066
You're all working together.

1181
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:54,834
But I'm not sure if we could prep

1182
01:25:54,934 --> 01:25:56,567
all the ingredients at once.

1183
01:25:56,667 --> 01:26:00,333
Tomorrow, we'll be working
whenever we have free time.

1184
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,667
- Okay.
- Because there's no break time.

1185
01:26:02,734 --> 01:26:03,667
Okay.

1186
01:26:03,734 --> 01:26:05,800
Keep frying the chicken.

1187
01:26:05,867 --> 01:26:07,700
- Okay!
- Good.

1188
01:26:08,333 --> 01:26:10,133
Let's go.

1189
01:26:10,967 --> 01:26:12,467
I should take the probiotics.

1190
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:35,533
Seo Jun's wearing the most normal one.

1191
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,600
I just put on what I was told to wear.

1192
01:26:40,233 --> 01:26:42,033
Seriously,

1193
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:44,800
who bought these in the first place?

1194
01:26:46,967 --> 01:26:49,133
It doesn't look so bad with white shorts.

1195
01:26:52,467 --> 01:26:56,000
If the boss wore it,
he would've looked really corny.

1196
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:58,767
Seo Jin said
he didn't want to wear this...

1197
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,867
Hey, it's past 3 PMS.

1198
01:27:14,533 --> 01:27:16,533
- A cat came in.
- What?

1199
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:19,066
- Oh.
- Oh.

1200
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:22,934
Whose cat is it?

1201
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:24,500
I haven't seen that cat.

1202
01:27:30,433 --> 01:27:32,467
Let's go.

1203
01:27:32,567 --> 01:27:35,100
Wait up for me!

1204
01:27:42,567 --> 01:27:44,867
It feels so good

1205
01:27:44,934 --> 01:27:47,567
- to go to work at this hour.
- It's so nice.

1206
01:27:47,633 --> 01:27:50,233
- It's relaxing, right?
- Yes.

1207
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:52,533
How many chickens should we fry today?

1208
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:53,533
All of them?

1209
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:56,834
Let's fry 4kg first and then see.

1210
01:27:56,900 --> 01:27:59,367
I think 4kg will be enough.

1211
01:27:59,433 --> 01:28:03,033
Yu Mi, are you going to make
bulgogi and spicy pork…

1212
01:28:03,133 --> 01:28:05,600
We need to make
the bulgogi for gimbap too.

1213
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:08,166
- We just need to marinate the meat, right?
- Yes.

1214
01:28:08,266 --> 01:28:11,233
- And stir-fry it before serving.
- Yes, we have the marinade.

1215
01:28:11,333 --> 01:28:13,934
Tae Hyung,
grate the cucumbers and carrots.

1216
01:28:14,967 --> 01:28:16,900
We used all of them yesterday.

1217
01:28:16,967 --> 01:28:19,400
Listen to us talking.

1218
01:28:19,467 --> 01:28:21,934
- We sound like real restaurant staff.
- We need to.

1219
01:28:23,233 --> 01:28:25,333
After one week, it's normal.

1220
01:28:25,400 --> 01:28:27,133
Seo Jin, let's keep it up

1221
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:29,900
so we can move to the historic area.

1222
01:28:30,734 --> 01:28:33,066
- Yeah, let's go to the square.
- To the square.

1223
01:28:33,066 --> 01:28:34,934
We can't be in the outskirts forever.

1224
01:28:34,967 --> 01:28:36,000
We can do it.

1225
01:28:45,500 --> 01:28:48,166
The street seems crowded today.

1226
01:28:56,400 --> 01:28:58,333
Wait, what…

1227
01:28:58,400 --> 01:29:01,000
Do we have customers waiting already?

1228
01:29:01,066 --> 01:29:02,934
- Oh, no. Already?
- What?

1229
01:29:11,066 --> 01:29:12,300
No…

1230
01:29:17,934 --> 01:29:20,266
Gosh, I feel so refreshed after the break.

1231
01:29:22,033 --> 01:29:22,867
Okay.

1232
01:29:22,967 --> 01:29:25,133
Okay. Let's go!

1233
01:29:26,467 --> 01:29:29,633
Let's put one more table.

1234
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:30,967
Let's put one more table.

1235
01:29:31,033 --> 01:29:32,667
But I need to fry the chicken.

1236
01:29:32,734 --> 01:29:33,667
I'll go get it.

1237
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,166
We're open for dinner only. No breaks.

1238
01:29:38,233 --> 01:29:40,000
- You know what to recommend.
- Yes.

1239
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:42,066
Today's special, is

1240
01:29:42,166 --> 01:29:43,266
rice.

1241
01:29:43,367 --> 01:29:44,800
Spicy pork and bulgogi rice.

1242
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:47,533
Whoa, it looks so good.
I wanna have it too.

1243
01:29:47,633 --> 01:29:49,133
It looks amazing.

1244
01:29:49,667 --> 01:29:51,867
We're turning into a real restaurant.

1245
01:29:51,967 --> 01:29:52,834
We can do it.

1246
01:29:52,900 --> 01:29:54,133
- We can do it.
- Yes.

1247
01:29:54,200 --> 01:29:56,500
- We have a mountain of chicken today.
- Right.

1248
01:29:57,834 --> 01:30:00,467
Things are going so smoothly today.

1249
01:30:00,467 --> 01:30:02,533
The chicken restaurant owner is coming.

1250
01:30:02,567 --> 01:30:03,900
Now?

1251
01:30:03,900 --> 01:30:05,633
We have three reservations.

1252
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:08,600
- What?
- A reservation.

1253
01:30:08,667 --> 01:30:10,100
- Manuel?
- Two.

1254
01:30:10,166 --> 01:30:11,200
Hola.

1255
01:30:11,433 --> 01:30:12,333
Hola.

1256
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,266
We're having a rush again.

1257
01:30:16,767 --> 01:30:19,800
There's a waiting list up there.

1258
01:30:19,900 --> 01:30:20,834
- Seo Jin.
- Yes?

1259
01:30:20,934 --> 01:30:23,633
- Why did you not give them the drinks?
- Where?

1260
01:30:23,734 --> 01:30:26,000
We should make more spicy pork marinade.

1261
01:30:26,066 --> 01:30:27,400
One isn't served yet.

1262
01:30:27,433 --> 01:30:30,667
No, one is in here.

1263
01:30:30,734 --> 01:30:32,133
Fried tofu, sold out.

1264
01:30:32,200 --> 01:30:33,834
Every day is a crisis.

1265
01:30:43,734 --> 01:30:45,700
Tomorrow, we must hit a sales record.

1266
01:30:45,767 --> 01:30:47,166
- Then…
- What?

1267
01:31:27,667 --> 01:31:30,300
JINNY'S KITCHEN
