00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:26,033
JINNY'S KITCHEN

2
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,600
Three, two, one.

3
00:00:27,667 --> 00:00:29,333
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,166
You're like a human salad spinner.

5
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,533
This is going well. No mistakes so far.

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,567
Why is nobody coming?

7
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:42,600
We have no customers today.

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,633
You said they love Korean food.

9
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,633
Why did they fry so many chickens?

10
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,734
Why did you prep so many laver rolls?

11
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:55,400
What do we do with the chicken?
This is driving me crazy.

12
00:01:34,467 --> 00:01:35,667
Done.

13
00:01:35,734 --> 00:01:37,266
- We're closed.
- Are we closed?

14
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:39,333
Done. We're closed.

15
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,567
Are we closed now?

16
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:46,000
Look at our dinner piled up here.

17
00:01:46,066 --> 00:01:47,467
Let's pack them all.

18
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,667
Will it fit in one container?

19
00:01:56,734 --> 00:01:58,166
Almost, but not everything.

20
00:01:58,233 --> 00:02:00,633
Then I'll put the rest in this container.

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,300
We still managed to make 350,000 won,
which is not so...

22
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:18,767
It's not 350,000 won.

23
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:24,233
I'm leaving now.

24
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:25,367
Are you walking home?

25
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:26,633
I'll bike home.

26
00:02:35,734 --> 00:02:37,000
How refreshing.

27
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,734
Perro!

28
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:49,100
Perro!

29
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:55,066
Perro!

30
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,133
No, I'll see you tomorrow.

31
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,266
Perro.

32
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:01,433
Let's meet tomorrow. Oh, my gosh.

33
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,700
Are you really following me?

34
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,033
Perro!

35
00:03:15,734 --> 00:03:18,000
Thank you.

36
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:49,667
About this chicken...

37
00:03:49,734 --> 00:03:52,533
I think it'll taste better with some rice.

38
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,333
Does the chicken come
with rice or something?

39
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,367
It's just the chicken.

40
00:03:57,433 --> 00:03:59,767
- Does it come with rice?
- Just the chicken.

41
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,333
- Okay.
- But I guess...

42
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:06,100
Everyone who orders spicy fricken

43
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,367
asks us if it comes with rice.

44
00:04:09,433 --> 00:04:10,433
Chicken rice.

45
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:11,800
I wanna try both.

46
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:13,266
With the sauce and without.

47
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,233
Why don't we make one

48
00:04:15,266 --> 00:04:18,100
with mayo and soy sauce?

49
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,633
Could you make some scrambled eggs?

50
00:04:36,633 --> 00:04:38,033
Of course, I can.

51
00:04:39,033 --> 00:04:41,367
I'm not sure how it'll taste.
I've never had it before.

52
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,200
Woo Shik, put that over here.

53
00:04:56,433 --> 00:04:58,400
Seo Jun, what's this menu?

54
00:04:58,433 --> 00:04:59,433
This?

55
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,633
Chicken fried rice
made with Tae Hyung's love.

56
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,333
Chicken fried rice.

57
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,800
So Chibap, in short?

58
00:05:07,033 --> 00:05:08,600
- Chibap.
- Chibap.

59
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:11,300
We have two versions.

60
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:15,400
This one's the soy sauce version.

61
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:18,266
Spicy fricken, rice, and laver flakes.

62
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:21,667
Oh, no. No mayo.

63
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:25,266
That's chicken mayo.
It's the young people's culture.

64
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,533
Let's just eat it.

65
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,100
It's not bad.

66
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,033
Mmm.

67
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:53,033
You know what?

68
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:56,500
Spicy fricken goes well with mayo too,

69
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:58,533
but I think this one will go even better.

70
00:05:58,533 --> 00:05:59,667
Let's try that.

71
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,400
With some laver flakes and mayo, it'll be...

72
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:14,266
Just like what they sell on the street.

73
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,266
Looks yummy.

74
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,600
Chicken mayo.

75
00:06:17,767 --> 00:06:19,266
You're right.

76
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,767
He loves it.

77
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,600
Now how many chickens do we have to prep?

78
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,033
Wow!

79
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:32,300
It's just impossible to taste bad.

80
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:34,567
Right?

81
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,000
It's tasty.

82
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:39,266
This is the chicken rice that I know.

83
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,633
Oh yea?

84
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,533
I'm more used to this chicken rice.

85
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,100
To be honest, taste-wise,

86
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:46,467
I give this ten out of ten

87
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:48,300
and this seven out of ten.

88
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:51,133
I agree. This version could be better.

89
00:07:01,433 --> 00:07:02,600
The way I see it,

90
00:07:02,667 --> 00:07:05,734
there's something more important
than adding a new menu.

91
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:07,433
A strategic decision.

92
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:10,600
We gotta think about
how to survive the weekdays.

93
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:14,333
I think it was a bad idea
taking a day off yesterday.

94
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,333
Huh?

95
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:19,433
We should've kept the momentum going.

96
00:07:19,467 --> 00:07:22,066
How about 5,000 pesos
as a weekday's goal?

97
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:23,400
And more on the weekend.

98
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,367
We didn't even make 5,000 today.

99
00:07:25,433 --> 00:07:27,033
How much did we make today?

100
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,266
We made 4,700 pesos.

101
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:29,633
That's less than 5,000.

102
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,800
Did you say 4,700?

103
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,633
That's not bad.

104
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:35,367
Seo Jin's goal was 7,500 pesos.

105
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,166
It's not that bad.

106
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:43,100
I hope we can make
100,000 pesos by Saturday.

107
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:45,600
In total, 100,000 pesos.

108
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,567
- Why not?
- We're only open for eight days.

109
00:07:50,633 --> 00:07:52,800
We barely make 10,000 pesos a day.

110
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:56,433
We made over 20,000 so far.

111
00:07:56,467 --> 00:07:59,367
- You think you can make 80,000?
- Well, that was my plan

112
00:07:59,433 --> 00:08:02,433
until we opened the restaurant today.

113
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,133
How about we open for the night time?

114
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,600
We were open late today.

115
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:07,667
But nobody came.

116
00:08:07,734 --> 00:08:09,367
That's why we closed the place.

117
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:10,800
- Night...
- Seo Jin, you're...

118
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,767
Seo Jin, don't be so...

119
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,300
Well, 4,700 isn't so bad.

120
00:08:15,367 --> 00:08:17,367
I mean, wasn't our previous goal 4,500?

121
00:08:17,433 --> 00:08:19,333
Well, 4,500 has never been my goal.

122
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,233
- It was 5,000.
- Who said that?

123
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:24,433
On the first day,
we only made 1,800 pesos.

124
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,166
On the second day,
we made over 5,000 pesos.

125
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:29,734
Then on the third day,
we made over 10,000 pesos.

126
00:08:29,767 --> 00:08:31,433
We lost our momentum.

127
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,600
That's why I think it was a bad idea
to have closed yesterday.

128
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,333
You took a day off for your employees

129
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,066
who worked so hard
to make 10,000 pesos, remember?

130
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,133
Now, we must get back on track.

131
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,333
I have an idea.

132
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,066
Happy hour.

133
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,800
Happy hour is for drinks.

134
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,266
It's not for food.

135
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,000
We can offer free drinks.

136
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:57,133
Free drinks? No way.

137
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,400
Or give a 20 percent discount.

138
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:02,100
We're talking about making profits here.

139
00:09:02,133 --> 00:09:05,066
They need to pay for what they get.

140
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:06,734
We're not giving stuff for free.

141
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,600
I'm sorry, but isn't this a variety show?

142
00:09:14,767 --> 00:09:16,734
I thought this was a variety show.

143
00:09:16,767 --> 00:09:20,333
And it feels like
I'm actually working for a restaurant.

144
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:23,700
We need to make 5,000 at least.

145
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,166
How could we not make even 5,000 pesos?

146
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:31,133
He's too into this.

147
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,233
He's too into this.

148
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:38,233
After three more days here,

149
00:09:38,266 --> 00:09:41,367
I feel like
he'll no longer be the person I knew.

150
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:44,433
It's like The Shining, the movie.

151
00:09:49,133 --> 00:09:53,033
Didn't you say all stores are closed
on Wednesdays here?

152
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,633
Tomorrow?

153
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,533
- We're not closed.
- Not all of them.

154
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,166
But lots of stores are.

155
00:10:15,734 --> 00:10:19,333
Does that mean
we will have even less customers?

156
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:22,367
People might come to ours
because others are closed.

157
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,467
It'll be busy.

158
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,266
Maybe other stores are closed
because there are no people.

159
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:30,100
Wednesdays must be like holidays here.

160
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,600
I bet we'll be busy tomorrow.

161
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:34,800
You think so?

162
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,266
That's how I feel.

163
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,367
This is what I like about Yu Mi.
She's positive.

164
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:43,200
Watch and learn.

165
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,266
It's not like
I don't want to be positive here.

166
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,300
Goodness. Come on.

167
00:10:51,066 --> 00:10:53,066
Not even ants were on the street.

168
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,200
There were lots of ants on the street.

169
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,100
- Good night.
- Good night.

170
00:11:16,066 --> 00:11:17,266
Gosh, I'm so tired.

171
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:21,567
I'll get a good night's sleep
in this wool duvet.

172
00:11:26,734 --> 00:11:28,400
So tired.

173
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,367
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

174
00:12:51,734 --> 00:12:53,133
Did you sleep well?

175
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,633
Yeah, but I got so many mosquito bites.

176
00:12:57,467 --> 00:12:59,367
I'm so tired.

177
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:11,600
Is that ramyeon?

178
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:14,333
No, it's just water.

179
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:35,000
Down the orchard road out of town

180
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:38,600
Acacia flowers are in full bloom

181
00:13:41,467 --> 00:13:44,100
I couldn't get this out of my head
since I woke up.

182
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,567
- The orchard song?
- Yes.

183
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:50,166
White fetals

184
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:53,233
Fall like snowflakes

185
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,333
Did you audition like this too?

186
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:56,700
No, my dad sings like this.

187
00:13:57,533 --> 00:13:59,333
And also how I sing.

188
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:02,734
My dad sings every song one octave lower.

189
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:04,266
He'd suddenly say to me,

190
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,767
"Hey, son."

191
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,367
"Do you want me
to sing Love Last for you?"

192
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:10,133
- You mean Last Love?
- Last Love.

193
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,066
You

194
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,500
You are

195
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:20,033
My last love

196
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,066
He sang like this.

197
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,266
What about your mother?

198
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,667
My mom's good. She likes to sing Tears.

199
00:14:24,734 --> 00:14:26,100
- Tears?
- Tears?

200
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:28,166
Don't call me cruel

201
00:14:30,033 --> 00:14:32,567
Tears?

202
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,633
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

203
00:14:53,767 --> 00:14:55,133
Woo Shik, it's 11:10.

204
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,533
- I'm leaving.
- Keep it up.

205
00:14:56,567 --> 00:14:58,100
Yes, sir. I will.

206
00:14:59,367 --> 00:15:00,667
All right.

207
00:15:02,433 --> 00:15:04,100
Why am I so tired today?

208
00:15:04,133 --> 00:15:05,600
Yo, Tae Hyung.

209
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:07,800
You ready?

210
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,100
We're taking that other car, right?

211
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:11,567
Yeah, the one outside.

212
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,300
Yo, what's up.

213
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,400
Yo, you ready?

214
00:15:27,133 --> 00:15:29,567
Finally, it's Wednesday.

215
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,800
What's your goal today?

216
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:33,333
You seemed really bummed yesterday.

217
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,033
Which demoralized your employees.

218
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,300
Well, today,

219
00:15:37,367 --> 00:15:39,066
we'll start feeling bummed.

220
00:15:39,567 --> 00:15:41,100
You won't have high hopes?

221
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,200
Today, we won't prep many ingredients.

222
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:45,333
And close the place when we run out.

223
00:15:45,367 --> 00:15:48,600
As you know,
Wednesday is a special day in this area.

224
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:50,667
They never have many people here anyway.

225
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:52,800
On holidays, it must be even worse.

226
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:56,467
Well, most restaurants are closed
on Wednesdays.

227
00:15:56,533 --> 00:16:00,266
They must be closed for a reason.

228
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,500
It means
there's nobody here on Wednesdays.

229
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:04,400
Because there are no people?

230
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:05,400
That must be why.

231
00:16:05,433 --> 00:16:08,800
If everything is closed except one store...

232
00:16:09,033 --> 00:16:10,066
Nobody will be there.

233
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,700
Seo Jin.

234
00:16:11,533 --> 00:16:12,734
- Cranky again?
- No.

235
00:16:12,734 --> 00:16:14,433
This is why yesterday...

236
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,767
I'm not being cranky.

237
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,100
I mean, obviously,
introducing Korean food to the world is...

238
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:22,633
I know that's my dream and goal.

239
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,767
Okay?

240
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,266
But to do that, people have to come.

241
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,700
That's true.

242
00:16:27,734 --> 00:16:29,166
And I can't just sit back

243
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,367
and let the ingredients go bad.

244
00:16:31,433 --> 00:16:33,600
You do have a point.

245
00:16:33,667 --> 00:16:37,000
The employees started to complain

246
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:40,600
about you being overly passionate
for this role.

247
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,000
Your employees seem confused.

248
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:46,100
What are your thoughts on that?

249
00:16:47,767 --> 00:16:49,266
If we had many customers,

250
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,767
then these kids wouldn't have time
to complain.

251
00:16:54,433 --> 00:16:57,400
If they were busy,
they wouldn't have such complaints

252
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,734
They have too much time
and are getting ideas.

253
00:16:59,767 --> 00:17:01,266
He's so funny.

254
00:17:09,633 --> 00:17:12,033
Maybe I should buy some clothes here.

255
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,600
I guess we can park here.

256
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:17,700
We came too early.

257
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,533
Let's make another round.

258
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,800
- No, we should park here.
- Let's do one more round.

259
00:17:36,734 --> 00:17:39,266
- Chicken breast?
- Chicken breast, without bones.

260
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,066
We want 4kg of that.

261
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:45,133
You can go buy clothes while I wait here.

262
00:17:45,734 --> 00:17:47,800
Something like those Hawaiian shirts.

263
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,100
They look pretty.

264
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:01,133
Hello.

265
00:18:09,367 --> 00:18:10,800
Where's men's clothing?

266
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,066
Donde está tu ropa de hombre.

267
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:17,700
Donde está tu... de...

268
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,533
Dombre?

269
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:25,500
¿Donde está tu ropa?

270
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:27,266
- Men's clothing?
- For men.

271
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:29,066
It's inside.

272
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:30,533
Thank you.

273
00:18:32,066 --> 00:18:34,266
I don't need party clothes.

274
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:35,567
Oh, here they are.

275
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Nice. This is Woo Shik's.

276
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,633
This looks perfect for Seo Jin, right?

277
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,266
Do I look okay?

278
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,166
I'll get one for Seo Jin.

279
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,333
I'll get this one.

280
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,000
This one's cuter.

281
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,066
I hear the kids are buying clothes
in the market.

282
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:19,667
Woo Shik, that kid is unreliable.

283
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,567
He's the problem.

284
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,100
Hello?

285
00:19:29,133 --> 00:19:31,033
- Woo Shik?
- Hello?

286
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,100
- Yes?
- Woo Shik.

287
00:19:33,133 --> 00:19:35,233
- Hello?
- Who is this? Woo Shik?

288
00:19:35,266 --> 00:19:37,300
- I can hear you.
- Woo Shik.

289
00:19:38,767 --> 00:19:41,266
- Woo Shik.
- Hello?

290
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:43,533
Are you pretending that you don't hear me?

291
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,767
It's dropped.

292
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,266
Darn it.

293
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,166
I can never let him out of my sight.

294
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,500
Why don't we do a staff evaluation?

295
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:55,600
I guess why not?

296
00:19:55,633 --> 00:19:59,066
First, Executive Director Jung.
Out of 100, how would you rate...

297
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,533
I think Executive Director is

298
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,533
the farthest she could get.

299
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,800
No more promotion.

300
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,667
She'll have to retire after this.

301
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:11,433
What's her strength?

302
00:20:11,467 --> 00:20:12,333
Her strength?

303
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:14,500
She's meticulous.

304
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,600
And she's kind of creative.

305
00:20:16,667 --> 00:20:17,800
So she got promoted.

306
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,133
What does she lack?

307
00:20:19,133 --> 00:20:20,734
She gets so easily distracted.

308
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,767
She has to bike and all.

309
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,600
She doesn't care.

310
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,200
On a scale of zero to ten?

311
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:29,734
I'd say 7.5? Or 8 points?

312
00:20:33,266 --> 00:20:35,433
Next, Senior Manager Park.

313
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:38,333
He's definitely a successor material.

314
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,033
After Jinny's Kitchen,
it'll be Junny's Kitchen.

315
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,300
He's a great chef and leader.

316
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,467
He's also got lots of ideas.

317
00:20:45,533 --> 00:20:46,467
He's great.

318
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:47,600
Your successor?

319
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:48,567
Yes.

320
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,300
If anyone, he'd be it?

321
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,600
Of course. Who else?

322
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,100
On a scale of zero to ten?

323
00:20:53,133 --> 00:20:55,400
He deserves at least 9.5 points.

324
00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:00,266
What are your thoughts on Intern Choi?

325
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,767
What are his strengths?

326
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,600
Woo Shik has the knack
for being friends with anybody.

327
00:21:05,667 --> 00:21:07,767
Serving is a perfect job for him.

328
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,367
He's quick-witted.

329
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:13,700
He's got a great personality
to deal with people.

330
00:21:15,266 --> 00:21:16,433
And his weaknesses?

331
00:21:19,166 --> 00:21:20,266
There are a lot.

332
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,600
He always tries to hide somewhere.

333
00:21:26,734 --> 00:21:30,233
He always tries
to hide somewhere and slack off.

334
00:21:30,266 --> 00:21:32,734
I have to have him
in my sight at all times.

335
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:35,500
Otherwise, I feel uneasy.

336
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,367
I'd say 6... 6.5?

337
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:42,400
No, 6.5 to 7.

338
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:49,467
What are Tae Hyung's strengths
and weaknesses as an intern?

339
00:21:49,533 --> 00:21:51,633
He does his work without complaining.

340
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:55,000
And he is willing to work hard.

341
00:21:55,066 --> 00:21:55,800
He's diligent.

342
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:57,734
He's diligent.

343
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,800
And his weaknesses?

344
00:21:59,033 --> 00:22:00,233
He's slow as molasses.

345
00:22:04,433 --> 00:22:06,033
He's so slow.

346
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:09,734
It takes him forever
to get the veggies grated.

347
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:11,667
How would you evaluate his performance?

348
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,800
Similar to Woo Shik. I'd say seven?

349
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,133
The interns got similar scores.

350
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,400
They're different to the same extent.

351
00:22:24,734 --> 00:22:26,500
Pineapple...

352
00:22:34,166 --> 00:22:35,533
Uh... Cut...?

353
00:22:40,066 --> 00:22:41,300
Oh, I got it.

354
00:22:41,367 --> 00:22:43,433
Could you chop this too?

355
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,667
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

356
00:22:47,734 --> 00:22:50,367
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

357
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,633
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

358
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,100
- That's it?
- This is it?

359
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,533
There's more.

360
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:58,734
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

361
00:22:59,734 --> 00:23:01,467
Right. Money.

362
00:23:03,734 --> 00:23:05,166
How much was it?

363
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:08,734
Thank you.

364
00:23:08,767 --> 00:23:10,300
- Let's hurry.
- Muy bien.

365
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,266
Why do you run like that?

366
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:28,600
- Are you ready? Si?
- Yes.

367
00:23:28,667 --> 00:23:30,300
- Ready?
- Yup. Shall we go?

368
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,400
Let's go.

369
00:23:32,033 --> 00:23:35,700
I hope we get many customers today.

370
00:23:35,734 --> 00:23:37,400
It was so slow yesterday.

371
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:39,400
It wasn't bad. We made some profit.

372
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,600
- Yes.
- Thank you.

373
00:24:00,633 --> 00:24:01,667
Hola.

374
00:24:05,367 --> 00:24:08,266
Okay. While I wash this,

375
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:10,734
could you mix
the chicken batter mix with water?

376
00:24:10,767 --> 00:24:13,200
Remember the consistency from yesterday?

377
00:24:13,233 --> 00:24:14,667
After I do the rice.

378
00:24:14,667 --> 00:24:16,166
Right. You cook the rice.

379
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:16,767
Do that.

380
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,367
It's okay. I'll help you after this.

381
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,700
It won't take long anyway.

382
00:24:20,734 --> 00:24:22,066
Okay.

383
00:24:29,066 --> 00:24:31,500
Your favorite,
Senior Manger Park is coming.

384
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,734
There was a staff evaluation just now.

385
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:38,700
- Staff evaluation?
- Yes, CEO Lee Seo Jin said

386
00:24:38,734 --> 00:24:42,233
that Seo Jun is
the only successor material here.

387
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,333
Are you interested in succeeding him?

388
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:48,166
Oh, sure.

389
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,166
You're saying that
because the boss is here.

390
00:24:53,233 --> 00:24:54,800
I'm so honored.

391
00:24:55,033 --> 00:24:56,400
I'll do my best.

392
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,467
Seo Jun doesn't lie.

393
00:25:01,467 --> 00:25:03,500
- I mean it.
- I knew it.

394
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:06,400
- Okay.
- Got that.

395
00:25:08,266 --> 00:25:10,567
I need to take the probiotics.

396
00:25:10,633 --> 00:25:12,133
I have a sensitive stomach.

397
00:25:46,467 --> 00:25:47,700
Here we go.

398
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,567
All right.

399
00:25:52,633 --> 00:25:53,800
We're doing great.

400
00:25:54,033 --> 00:25:55,734
- We're doing great.
- Yes.

401
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,367
Let's open a food truck.

402
00:25:57,367 --> 00:25:59,533
Of course. We can even open a restaurant.

403
00:25:59,567 --> 00:26:01,300
You do the serving. I'll cook.

404
00:26:01,367 --> 00:26:02,266
Okay.

405
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:06,567
What should we sell on our food truck?

406
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:09,567
Anything you want.

407
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,300
How about fried chicken?

408
00:26:11,367 --> 00:26:13,400
Why not? Should we open a chicken truck?

409
00:26:13,433 --> 00:26:17,133
- You can take a break whenever you want.
- Right.

410
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,300
What a perfect plan.

411
00:26:19,367 --> 00:26:21,066
Tell them to take their time.

412
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,767
Because we will do all the work.

413
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,033
We don't want a crowded kitchen.

414
00:26:25,033 --> 00:26:26,700
Let's film this episode on our own.

415
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,633
- Maybe they haven't come yet.
- Thanks.

416
00:26:33,333 --> 00:26:36,133
There aren't many people
on Wednesdays anyways, so...

417
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:37,400
- we'll do it alone.
- Sure.

418
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:39,500
What's this? Did they go shopping?

419
00:26:39,567 --> 00:26:40,800
What?

420
00:26:42,333 --> 00:26:43,233
Are they ours?

421
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,400
Maybe they bought them for us.

422
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:47,433
- What did they buy?
- They went shopping.

423
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:51,533
The Interns is over now.

424
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,533
Hello.

425
00:26:52,567 --> 00:26:54,567
- Hi, sir.
- Hi, sir.

426
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,166
I heard you went shopping?

427
00:26:56,233 --> 00:26:57,233
What?

428
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:00,266
I didn't.

429
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,500
What do you mean?

430
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,433
Who was it? Him?

431
00:27:02,467 --> 00:27:03,667
No, we didn't.

432
00:27:03,734 --> 00:27:04,734
Then what's that?

433
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
A watermelon.

434
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,200
I mean the other stuff.

435
00:27:07,233 --> 00:27:08,767
We didn't go shopping, right?

436
00:27:09,734 --> 00:27:11,233
What are the hats and all?

437
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,100
Shopping?

438
00:27:13,166 --> 00:27:16,467
I don't know.
Maybe it's a gift from someone.

439
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,233
Why did they buy such goofy stuff?

440
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,133
There are yours too.

441
00:27:28,266 --> 00:27:30,066
There's yours too.

442
00:27:30,433 --> 00:27:31,700
- What's that?
- Why did...

443
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:33,333
This must be yours.

444
00:27:34,767 --> 00:27:36,333
- What's this?
- It's for you.

445
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,233
Wait. It must be yours.

446
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,033
It's x-large. It's Seo Jun's.

447
00:27:42,066 --> 00:27:44,233
Why did they waste money on these?

448
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,767
All right. No more chit-chats.

449
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,500
You clean over there. I'll clean here.

450
00:28:01,567 --> 00:28:02,567
Okay.

451
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,367
I think we'll be super busy today.

452
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:08,734
Because everything is closed today

453
00:28:08,767 --> 00:28:10,033
except...

454
00:28:11,533 --> 00:28:13,367
for our restaurant.

455
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:20,066
I'll make this place spotlessly clean.

456
00:28:41,567 --> 00:28:43,000
Want some apple juice?

457
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:45,734
Is that from yesterday?

458
00:28:52,166 --> 00:28:54,066
Of course. Do you think I'd give you

459
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,567
today's juice?

460
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:03,800
Where's everyone?

461
00:29:05,533 --> 00:29:08,400
I feel like I'm the only one working here.

462
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:11,567
- Did you look for me?
- Yes.

463
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,734
Oops. That wasn't nice.

464
00:30:08,333 --> 00:30:10,433
It's literally handmade.

465
00:30:21,433 --> 00:30:25,367
Fresh, carefully picked cilantro

466
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,800
in fried tofu gimbap.

467
00:30:30,066 --> 00:30:31,000
Huh?

468
00:30:31,066 --> 00:30:33,700
I need to prep the cilantro again.

469
00:30:39,734 --> 00:30:40,734
- Seo Jin.
- Yes?

470
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:44,000
Do we add something to the juice
before we serve it?

471
00:30:44,066 --> 00:30:45,266
- Just watermelons?
- Yes.

472
00:30:45,333 --> 00:30:47,000
Have you tasted it?

473
00:30:47,066 --> 00:30:49,233
Do you put the seeds too?

474
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,300
Yes.

475
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,233
- Have you tried it?
- Not yet.

476
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,467
Do you want me to?

477
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:56,767
- Do you want to try it?
- What?

478
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,066
Do you want to try it?

479
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:01,567
Would you like to try
some watermelon juice?

480
00:31:01,633 --> 00:31:03,600
- Watermelon juice?
- Wanna try a bit?

481
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:05,600
- I'm good.
- No? You don't wanna?

482
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:06,567
Are you sure?

483
00:31:06,633 --> 00:31:08,533
- I kind of do, but--
- Wait here.

484
00:31:14,567 --> 00:31:16,600
Is it served with ice?

485
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:17,600
Yes.

486
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,066
Otherwise, we'll serve too much juice.

487
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,567
Yeah?

488
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,667
I think it was made long
with a rubber band.

489
00:31:27,734 --> 00:31:29,133
I think that's it.

490
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,233
How could a watermelon be so long?

491
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,567
Tae Hyung,
the watermelons here are so long.

492
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,066
I know, right?
The watermelons here look like that.

493
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,734
It's 100 percent fruit juice.

494
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:55,333
- It's 100 percent watermelon.
- It's good.

495
00:31:57,767 --> 00:31:59,367
It tastes amazing, right?

496
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,800
It's 100 percent watermelon.

497
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:04,734
There's no sugar inside?
Just a watermelon?

498
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,500
- Just a watermelon.
- Wow.

499
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,500
It's good.

500
00:32:11,467 --> 00:32:12,567
It's really good.

501
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,533
- I'm done, Yu Mi.
- Thanks.

502
00:32:18,533 --> 00:32:20,066
Aren't you hot? I can do it.

503
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:21,233
Can you do it?

504
00:32:21,266 --> 00:32:23,734
- You should take a break.
- Nice.

505
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,400
All right. Let's do this.

506
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:34,200
- Take some rest.
- Okay.

507
00:32:34,233 --> 00:32:35,467
- Tae Hyung.
- Yes?

508
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:36,600
Are you busy now?

509
00:32:36,633 --> 00:32:38,066
- Huh?
- Are you busy now?

510
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:40,633
- Are you busy?
- I'll help.

511
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,000
Woo Shik, wait for me.

512
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,100
How can I help you?

513
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:50,467
All right.

514
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,400
Woo Shik, I'm done with the cleaning.

515
00:32:53,433 --> 00:32:56,367
I'll help you after cleaning this up.

516
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,767
But you said you're done.

517
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,066
- What?
- You said you're done.

518
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,266
No, not yet.

519
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,567
I'll help you right after this.

520
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,066
Okay.

521
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,767
Let me know if you're tired.

522
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,233
Tell me if you're tired.

523
00:33:18,266 --> 00:33:19,233
I'm tired.

524
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,633
Could you say, "Tae Hyung, are you busy?"

525
00:33:35,667 --> 00:33:37,800
"Could you come and help me?"
in 20 seconds?

526
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,033
Okay.

527
00:33:41,667 --> 00:33:42,600
I can help you now.

528
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,100
- Okay.
- Good.

529
00:33:44,166 --> 00:33:45,266
One sec.

530
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:48,800
- Tae Hyung.
- Yes?

531
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:49,767
Are you busy?

532
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,233
- Nope.
- Could you help me out?

533
00:33:52,266 --> 00:33:53,567
Could you help me cut this?

534
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,567
Sure thing.

535
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,367
Tae Hyung, I'm tired.

536
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:01,133
Help me.

537
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:05,367
Please help me.

538
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:08,266
- Put it there.
- Seo Jin, take a break.

539
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:10,066
- We'll do the rest.
- Go inside.

540
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,400
It's hot here.

541
00:34:11,433 --> 00:34:13,767
We should make
just a bit of tteokbokki, right?

542
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,400
We won't have many orders.

543
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:16,767
I agree.

544
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,734
We'll go easy on tteokbokki today.

545
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:24,200
- Tteokbokki?
- Yes.

546
00:34:24,233 --> 00:34:25,333
How was it yesterday?

547
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:27,233
We barely sold any yesterday.

548
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,333
How many?

549
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:29,433
I think two?

550
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:40,333
Seo Jun, do you need any help?

551
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,066
- Huh?
- Do you need any help?

552
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:43,400
So you can help later?

553
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:44,800
No, now.

554
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:48,700
Ask me to help you after ten seconds.

555
00:34:49,133 --> 00:34:50,533
Woo Shik, I'm done now.

556
00:34:50,567 --> 00:34:53,233
- All right!
- All right!

557
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:55,667
- I just finished my part.
- Nice.

558
00:34:55,734 --> 00:34:57,500
- Tae Hyung.
- Yes?

559
00:34:57,567 --> 00:34:59,100
- Come here.
- Okay.

560
00:34:59,633 --> 00:35:02,467
All right!

561
00:35:11,667 --> 00:35:13,266
- All right.
- Tae Hyung.

562
00:35:45,734 --> 00:35:48,333
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

563
00:36:45,433 --> 00:36:46,767
Oh, too much.

564
00:36:49,233 --> 00:36:51,233
It's cooked faster on the heated pan.

565
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:53,333
Done.

566
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,633
Looks nice.

567
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,567
Pretty.

568
00:37:09,133 --> 00:37:11,333
Fricken rice looks really good.

569
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:12,700
A sample?

570
00:37:12,734 --> 00:37:14,500
I'm going to make it.

571
00:37:30,233 --> 00:37:31,633
Finished.

572
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:50,467
Five minutes until opening.

573
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:51,667
Okay.

574
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,567
What are you doing?

575
00:38:00,233 --> 00:38:01,100
Me?

576
00:38:01,166 --> 00:38:06,066
I thought I should look more smiley
when I make gimbap.

577
00:38:07,567 --> 00:38:09,567
- You wanna cover your mouth?
- Yes.

578
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,066
Draw a smile.

579
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:18,767
You really look smiley.

580
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:20,700
Nice.

581
00:38:21,166 --> 00:38:23,333
Nice.

582
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,066
The tteokbokki smells so good today.

583
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:30,233
It smells good, right?

584
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,266
We had tteokbokki yesterday.

585
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:34,367
The tteokbokki smells so good.

586
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,767
Does that mean
we will have even less customers?

587
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,333
We'll be busy tomorrow.

588
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:50,767
That's how I feel.

589
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:01,567
We're opening now.

590
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,166
- Okay.
- Let's open.

591
00:39:03,467 --> 00:39:04,467
Okay.

592
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,133
Seo Jin, that's exactly when

593
00:39:19,133 --> 00:39:21,533
the rice cakes start to absorb the sauce.

594
00:39:23,033 --> 00:39:23,800
Keep it covered?

595
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,567
Yeah, I think that's better.

596
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,734
Man, I'm tired already.

597
00:40:21,033 --> 00:40:23,166
This is bad.

598
00:40:23,233 --> 00:40:25,600
Our boss is gonna look gloomy again.

599
00:40:38,767 --> 00:40:40,266
Sir, we're open now, right?

600
00:40:40,333 --> 00:40:41,200
Yes.

601
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,734
No customers, huh?

602
00:40:45,767 --> 00:40:47,000
Well, today is...

603
00:40:47,066 --> 00:40:49,767
I'll bring some customers.

604
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,233
I'll bring some customers.

605
00:40:51,266 --> 00:40:52,500
How?

606
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,133
Hola.

607
00:41:01,767 --> 00:41:03,100
They're not interested.

608
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:09,233
I hear there's nobody out there.

609
00:41:11,467 --> 00:41:13,467
This is not a break time, is it?

610
00:41:14,667 --> 00:41:17,233
Are you sure you flipped the open sign?

611
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,166
What do we do?

612
00:41:25,633 --> 00:41:27,600
Oh, no. Boss is gonna be

613
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:29,000
so mad tonight again.

614
00:41:30,133 --> 00:41:33,433
Well, this was expected so...

615
00:41:35,734 --> 00:41:37,600
- Phew.
- Phew.

616
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:40,533
I think fricken rice
will be popular today.

617
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,133
Maybe I should make one

618
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:44,533
so we can all try it.

619
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,166
- I'll go make one.
- Okay.

620
00:41:46,233 --> 00:41:47,433
Make two.

621
00:41:47,467 --> 00:41:48,433
- Two servings?
- Yes.

622
00:41:48,433 --> 00:41:50,700
- No, make one.
- We need to sell it.

623
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:52,500
- Just make one.
- One serving.

624
00:41:57,734 --> 00:41:59,400
There's no one inside.

625
00:42:12,066 --> 00:42:13,233
Should we sit there?

626
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:22,133
I wanna see the menu.

627
00:42:25,133 --> 00:42:27,300
- Hello.
- Hello.

628
00:42:38,467 --> 00:42:39,700
- Hello.
- Hello!

629
00:42:39,767 --> 00:42:42,100
- How many?
- Two.

630
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,734
You may order here.

631
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,433
Hmm...

632
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,266
What should we eat? One ramyeon and...

633
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:56,133
How big is the portion of this menu?

634
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,500
This is a sample of it.

635
00:42:57,567 --> 00:42:58,700
You'll get ten pieces.

636
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:02,266
- This one's good.
- It looks tasty.

637
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,767
Which one should we have?

638
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,700
Let's go with bulgogi.

639
00:43:05,767 --> 00:43:07,433
- Okay.
- It's tasty.

640
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,800
I wanna try this too.

641
00:43:10,033 --> 00:43:10,767
Okay.

642
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,800
Do you have sparkling water?

643
00:43:14,033 --> 00:43:15,767
- Yes.
- They have sparkling water.

644
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,367
- One, just one.
- One sparkling water? Okay.

645
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,433
We got an order.

646
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:35,500
Tae Hyung, you're doing great.

647
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,066
I'll do my best.

648
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:42,266
- I've got this.
- Of course, you do.

649
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,433
That's the spirit.

650
00:43:43,467 --> 00:43:44,633
- Is it?
- Yes.

651
00:43:51,734 --> 00:43:54,133
- Hola.
- Hola.

652
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,533
Please order there.

653
00:43:57,767 --> 00:43:59,600
Ramyeon. Where's ramyeon?

654
00:44:02,533 --> 00:44:04,367
I wanna have this.

655
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,467
- The original?
- Yes, the original.

656
00:44:06,533 --> 00:44:08,667
Get a corn dog. I'll get something else.

657
00:44:08,667 --> 00:44:10,266
Okay, what do you wanna get?

658
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:12,600
Very delicious.

659
00:44:12,633 --> 00:44:14,033
Okay.

660
00:44:14,100 --> 00:44:15,667
I wanna order this.

661
00:44:15,734 --> 00:44:17,734
Then I want the one over it.

662
00:44:17,767 --> 00:44:18,633
The potato one.

663
00:44:18,700 --> 00:44:21,033
Yes, that and this one.

664
00:44:21,166 --> 00:44:23,467
- One each?
- Yes, please.

665
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,333
And for drinks?

666
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,500
Oh, drinks.

667
00:44:26,567 --> 00:44:28,333
I'll get the mineral water.

668
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,333
I'm getting a Coke.

669
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:31,767
Two Cokes and one mineral water.

670
00:44:39,533 --> 00:44:42,600
That young man looks like the actor
from the movie.

671
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:45,767
The movie we watched in Mexico City.

672
00:44:46,734 --> 00:44:48,467
Yeah, I get what you mean.

673
00:44:49,333 --> 00:44:51,166
You're right. He does look like him.

674
00:44:51,233 --> 00:44:52,400
- Right?
- Yes.

675
00:44:54,433 --> 00:44:56,500
But he can't be.

676
00:44:56,567 --> 00:45:01,300
I wonder which movie he starred in then.

677
00:45:01,367 --> 00:45:03,100
He looks like...

678
00:45:05,033 --> 00:45:07,600
the young man in the family.

679
00:45:07,633 --> 00:45:09,433
Yeah, he does.

680
00:45:10,567 --> 00:45:12,200
But this man's more handsome.

681
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,767
Maybe he's not supposed
to look good on camera.

682
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,800
The film was portraying
the rich and the poor.

683
00:45:26,433 --> 00:45:28,767
- You got an order.
- Okay. An order.

684
00:45:31,667 --> 00:45:34,767
One half & half corn dog
and one tater dog.

685
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,367
It's the order, right?

686
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,300
- Here you go. Sharing it, right?
- Yes.

687
00:46:46,367 --> 00:46:47,767
I'll put it in the middle.

688
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:51,100
Thanks.

689
00:46:51,333 --> 00:46:52,767
It looks delicious.

690
00:46:56,266 --> 00:46:57,767
Cucumbers, carrots, meat...

691
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,567
It's good with the sauce.

692
00:47:06,266 --> 00:47:08,266
- It's spicy, but really good.
- Yeah?

693
00:47:12,133 --> 00:47:13,433
It's so good.

694
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,767
I like the flavor.

695
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,600
Yummy.

696
00:47:31,767 --> 00:47:33,033
It's good.

697
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,667
It's spicy, but not too spicy.

698
00:47:40,533 --> 00:47:42,300
It's good spicy.

699
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,767
Your hair looks a bit Korean now.

700
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,600
- Yeah?
- With your bang, you know.

701
00:47:51,266 --> 00:47:54,433
- I'd really like to visit Korea.
- Right?

702
00:47:55,266 --> 00:47:57,266
It's so tasty.

703
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:23,633
It looks so yummy.

704
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,266
Look. There's ramyeon.

705
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:28,266
It's called hellamyeon.

706
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,100
I wanna have it spicy like this.

707
00:48:31,133 --> 00:48:32,533
Is this the way in?

708
00:48:34,266 --> 00:48:35,066
Hola.

709
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:38,700
It looks so good.

710
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:43,433
What's this? It's spicy, right?

711
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,100
Which one is the spiciest?

712
00:48:46,166 --> 00:48:47,767
This is our spiciest menu.

713
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,066
It's spicy, but...

714
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,500
muy Rico.

715
00:48:53,567 --> 00:48:55,767
Muy Rico. Nice pronunciation.

716
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,333
Muy Rico.

717
00:49:00,367 --> 00:49:02,100
- Is this not spicy?
- Just a bit.

718
00:49:02,133 --> 00:49:03,500
Then I'll get this one.

719
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,500
- What do you wanna get?
- I'll get a Coke and ramyeon.

720
00:49:09,033 --> 00:49:10,700
- You wanted...
- One original.

721
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:15,533
Does this one have cheese or meat inside?

722
00:49:15,600 --> 00:49:17,400
No cheese.

723
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:19,266
I don't eat cheese, so...

724
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:21,100
This one has no cheese.

725
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,333
Then I'll have one without the egg.

726
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:24,700
- No egg?
- No egg.

727
00:49:24,767 --> 00:49:26,533
Okay. We can make it like that.

728
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:29,100
- No egg? Okay.
- No egg.

729
00:49:29,133 --> 00:49:30,200
Thank you.

730
00:49:30,266 --> 00:49:31,633
Excuse me. Take this.

731
00:49:33,100 --> 00:49:34,200
What's this?

732
00:49:36,633 --> 00:49:39,033
It's so pretty though, isn't it?

733
00:49:50,734 --> 00:49:52,033
Thank you.

734
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,233
- One ramyeon.
- One ramyeon.

735
00:49:55,266 --> 00:49:57,000
One tater, one half & half.

736
00:49:57,066 --> 00:49:58,333
That is right.

737
00:50:30,166 --> 00:50:32,100
Can you speak English?

738
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,633
The boss seems happy now.

739
00:50:39,433 --> 00:50:41,233
We got one more group.

740
00:50:41,266 --> 00:50:42,600
What?

741
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:43,767
We're on fire now.

742
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,734
I can finally sleep well tonight.

743
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:52,433
Hey, we got three ramyeon orders.

744
00:50:52,467 --> 00:50:53,400
- Three?
- Yes.

745
00:50:53,433 --> 00:50:55,633
But one's without an egg.

746
00:51:01,667 --> 00:51:02,533
Hola.

747
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,800
- Hola.
- How many?

748
00:51:05,033 --> 00:51:07,633
Can I order for to-go?

749
00:51:12,266 --> 00:51:14,767
- Take-away.
- Take-away. Oh, sure.

750
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:17,033
Thank you.

751
00:51:18,633 --> 00:51:21,133
I'd like to get this and...

752
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,233
Spicy pork?

753
00:51:22,266 --> 00:51:23,433
Bulgogi gimbap.

754
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:25,800
- So, one of each?
- Yes.

755
00:51:28,567 --> 00:51:30,100
- Yu Mi.
- Yes?

756
00:51:30,166 --> 00:51:32,600
We got a to-go order.

757
00:51:32,633 --> 00:51:34,233
Oh, my God.

758
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,767
I'll do this first.

759
00:51:58,333 --> 00:52:00,600
I'll put the sauce on it.

760
00:52:00,667 --> 00:52:01,633
Okay.

761
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:03,767
- Please put the sauce on.
- Okay.

762
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:16,633
Here's one more.

763
00:52:22,467 --> 00:52:23,734
It's for the gray table.

764
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,200
Ramyeon?

765
00:52:35,367 --> 00:52:37,033
Gracias.

766
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:38,734
What kind of chili do they use?

767
00:52:39,734 --> 00:52:41,133
I don't know.

768
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,133
It smells good.

769
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,233
Not sure what it is, but it smells good.

770
00:52:51,100 --> 00:52:52,200
- It's good.
- Yeah?

771
00:52:52,266 --> 00:52:53,734
It does look good.

772
00:52:53,767 --> 00:52:56,633
Can I have some? I wanna try it.

773
00:53:03,533 --> 00:53:05,100
It's really hot.

774
00:53:05,166 --> 00:53:06,266
It's good.

775
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:09,000
And a little spicy.

776
00:53:09,066 --> 00:53:10,700
Just a little.

777
00:53:13,367 --> 00:53:15,233
They can roll off easily.

778
00:53:15,266 --> 00:53:16,400
I know.

779
00:53:16,433 --> 00:53:17,700
It's driving me crazy.

780
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,266
I'll help you.

781
00:53:23,333 --> 00:53:24,500
Which table?

782
00:53:24,567 --> 00:53:25,767
Gray.

783
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,100
- What?
- Gray.

784
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,600
It's good.

785
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,033
It's so good.

786
00:53:49,333 --> 00:53:50,433
Do you wanna try mine?

787
00:53:52,433 --> 00:53:54,433
It's so good.

788
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,767
It has fries on it.

789
00:53:58,433 --> 00:54:00,066
It's heavier.

790
00:54:03,433 --> 00:54:05,400
I've wanted to try this corn dog.

791
00:54:07,033 --> 00:54:09,233
- With the fries on.
- Me too.

792
00:54:09,433 --> 00:54:13,233
The combination with the sugar is

793
00:54:13,266 --> 00:54:14,667
really good.

794
00:54:15,367 --> 00:54:17,500
This one tastes like a churro.

795
00:54:17,567 --> 00:54:19,767
But with a sausage inside.

796
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:22,133
It's better than a churro.

797
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:24,433
Because it has the best savory stuffing

798
00:54:24,467 --> 00:54:26,567
inside the sweet bread.

799
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:27,600
I'm so full already.

800
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:29,767
You just had one, and you're already full.

801
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,533
You can't get full from a churro.

802
00:54:33,367 --> 00:54:35,467
They have that thing too.

803
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:37,467
- Elote?
- That's a corn dog.

804
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:42,600
I wanna try it.

805
00:54:42,633 --> 00:54:45,133
The corn dog?

806
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,567
- We can come back for it.
- Yeah.

807
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:50,667
Did you write that it's for to-go?

808
00:54:50,734 --> 00:54:52,600
Yeah, I told her that.

809
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:12,767
Yu Mi, the tteokbokki is getting scorched.

810
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,533
I said you should stir it.

811
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:17,433
I was getting orders nonstop.
I had no time to stir.

812
00:55:18,166 --> 00:55:21,100
I'm rolling gimbap now. Don't talk to me.

813
00:55:28,266 --> 00:55:30,433
Should I turn off the stove?

814
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,367
Yu Mi, should I turn it off?

815
00:55:32,433 --> 00:55:33,600
I'm rolling gimbap.

816
00:55:33,633 --> 00:55:34,700
So turn it off?

817
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:35,467
Be quiet.

818
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:36,433
Can I turn it off?

819
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,800
Go on and turn it off.

820
00:55:38,033 --> 00:55:40,100
Yeah? Just turn it off?

821
00:55:40,133 --> 00:55:42,667
- I'm busy rolling.
- All right, all right.

822
00:56:16,567 --> 00:56:18,433
Spicy pork? Nice.

823
00:56:30,734 --> 00:56:32,600
Here you go. Thank you.

824
00:56:37,633 --> 00:56:39,633
Tae Hyung, could you wash this?

825
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:40,667
- All right.
- Thanks.

826
00:56:40,734 --> 00:56:42,567
We have many ramyeon orders today.

827
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:44,066
Please be quick.

828
00:56:54,266 --> 00:56:56,233
We got lots of ramyeon orders.

829
00:56:57,166 --> 00:57:00,100
- We got three more orders?
- Yes.

830
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:01,333
Do you need any help?

831
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,133
Do you need water?

832
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,633
Yeah, I need water.

833
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,400
- Here.
- Okay.

834
00:57:08,433 --> 00:57:09,800
Where's the line?

835
00:57:10,033 --> 00:57:11,500
There it is.

836
00:57:11,567 --> 00:57:12,800
Oh, that's perfect.

837
00:57:13,633 --> 00:57:15,233
Okay, see?

838
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:19,333
Thank you.

839
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,000
Ramyeon is so popular today.

840
00:57:24,033 --> 00:57:25,600
We got three ramyeon orders.

841
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,667
Three ramyeons at once?

842
00:57:39,734 --> 00:57:41,400
The orders change every day.

843
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:58,200
Okay.

844
00:58:01,100 --> 00:58:03,467
I'll put four of these
on the one without eggs.

845
00:58:06,667 --> 00:58:08,767
It's the sign between us.

846
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,200
Tae Hyung, four slices...

847
00:58:10,266 --> 00:58:12,633
Four slices of chili means no eggs.
Got it.

848
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:13,600
Woo Shik?

849
00:58:13,667 --> 00:58:15,767
Four slices of chili means no eggs.

850
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,433
- Okay.
- Thanks.

851
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,433
Keep that in mind.

852
00:58:18,467 --> 00:58:20,133
- Okay. Thanks.
- Sure.

853
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:27,100
This one's with an egg.

854
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:34,233
It looks so pretty.

855
00:58:37,033 --> 00:58:38,433
It's really good.

856
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:48,266
It's so good.

857
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,667
I'm so full. It's quite filling.

858
00:58:52,734 --> 00:58:55,200
I'm sure this corn dog
will sell well here.

859
00:58:55,266 --> 00:58:56,266
I agree.

860
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,700
It's tasty, right?

861
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:01,533
- Thank you.
- Gracias.

862
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:04,100
- Gracias.
- Gracias.

863
00:59:10,367 --> 00:59:12,433
- This? Just one?
- Yes.

864
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,333
Okay. The bulgogi.

865
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:35,300
This is sweet chili.

866
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,300
I wanna try this one.

867
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:40,100
Right? Me too.

868
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,233
- Hello.
- Hi. We'd like to get one spicy fricken.

869
00:59:44,266 --> 00:59:46,266
And for drinks...

870
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:47,734
Do you have Coke?

871
00:59:47,767 --> 00:59:49,400
Coke? Yes.

872
00:59:49,433 --> 00:59:50,800
- Two Cokes?
- Yes.

873
00:59:54,066 --> 00:59:55,066
We got an order.

874
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,533
You're cute.

875
01:00:23,166 --> 01:00:24,166
Chicken...

876
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:26,100
Coming.

877
01:00:37,567 --> 01:00:39,433
Tae Hyung! We need the chicken now!

878
01:00:40,166 --> 01:00:41,400
- It's done.
- Oh, really?

879
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:50,166
Thank you.

880
01:00:54,633 --> 01:00:55,800
Thank you.

881
01:01:03,567 --> 01:01:05,233
Look. There's hellamyeon.

882
01:01:15,667 --> 01:01:16,700
Hola.

883
01:01:16,767 --> 01:01:18,133
How many?

884
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,133
- Four.
- Fou... Four.

885
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:23,767
- Let's have them here.
- Huh?

886
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,734
Let me clean it up.

887
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:29,166
Wow, we're full.

888
01:01:33,400 --> 01:01:35,066
Woo Shik, how is the boss?

889
01:01:35,133 --> 01:01:37,300
His smile is getting wider and wider.

890
01:01:39,567 --> 01:01:40,467
SMILE

891
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,667
Hola.

892
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,233
I saw there's something spicy.

893
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,200
Pica?

894
01:01:53,433 --> 01:01:55,133
Something very spicy?

895
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:57,533
- It's spicy.
- Very spicy.

896
01:01:58,467 --> 01:02:01,266
It's very spicy.

897
01:02:01,333 --> 01:02:03,467
I'm strong, so it's okay.

898
01:02:03,500 --> 01:02:05,000
He's okay.

899
01:02:06,667 --> 01:02:07,734
Macho man.

900
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:08,700
Macho man.

901
01:02:08,767 --> 01:02:09,800
Macho man.

902
01:02:13,266 --> 01:02:15,300
Macho man?

903
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:18,133
Guapo.

904
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:22,433
I'd like to get one hellamyeon.

905
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:25,266
And for my wife, this.

906
01:02:25,333 --> 01:02:26,800
What's this?

907
01:02:27,033 --> 01:02:31,200
It's called ramyeon.

908
01:02:31,266 --> 01:02:32,133
It's noodles with...

909
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:33,500
Look. There's a sample.

910
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,133
That's called fricken rice.

911
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:38,333
Oh, fricken rice.

912
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,600
It tastes excellen... excellent.

913
01:02:40,667 --> 01:02:42,166
Yeah?

914
01:02:42,233 --> 01:02:44,066
Today's special.

915
01:02:44,133 --> 01:02:47,066
It's very, very tasty.

916
01:02:47,133 --> 01:02:49,000
It must be really good.

917
01:02:51,266 --> 01:02:54,266
I changed my mind.

918
01:02:54,333 --> 01:02:56,700
Two fricken rice and one hellamyeon.

919
01:02:58,333 --> 01:03:00,166
- What?
- Two of this and one of this.

920
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,700
We'll cancel the ramyeon order.

921
01:03:01,734 --> 01:03:04,433
- So two fricken rice?
- Two fricken rice.

922
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,100
Two fricken rice.

923
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:48,166
Nice. You're awesome.

924
01:03:48,233 --> 01:03:49,233
Thank you.

925
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:14,266
Woo Shik.

926
01:04:14,333 --> 01:04:17,066
- Could you make some scrambled eggs?
- Sure.

927
01:04:17,133 --> 01:04:18,500
- Two?
- Yes.

928
01:05:01,734 --> 01:05:03,133
Fricken rice?

929
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,600
Here. You ordered one too, right?

930
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:07,300
Thank you.

931
01:05:07,367 --> 01:05:08,700
Kimchi?

932
01:05:08,767 --> 01:05:10,000
Sure.

933
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:15,166
- Sure.
- Sure.

934
01:05:18,100 --> 01:05:19,800
One more, please. Thank you.

935
01:05:20,066 --> 01:05:21,667
I don't think you will finish it.

936
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:22,767
I'll leave you some.

937
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:31,767
It's good.

938
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:38,200
What's this?

939
01:05:39,266 --> 01:05:40,367
I don't know.

940
01:05:44,266 --> 01:05:46,266
Kimchi is made of...

941
01:05:46,333 --> 01:05:47,633
What was it?

942
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,000
You don't know, do you?

943
01:05:50,667 --> 01:05:52,300
It's made of cabbage.

944
01:05:52,367 --> 01:05:56,033
It's fermented in crocks.

945
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:57,633
It smells good.

946
01:05:58,667 --> 01:06:01,166
So it's like some side dish?

947
01:06:01,233 --> 01:06:04,000
I think so. Let's try it.

948
01:06:13,633 --> 01:06:16,233
It's really good.

949
01:06:16,300 --> 01:06:17,533
This?

950
01:06:21,033 --> 01:06:22,667
It's good.

951
01:06:25,166 --> 01:06:26,333
It's really good.

952
01:06:31,633 --> 01:06:32,800
Macho man?

953
01:06:35,133 --> 01:06:36,767
Very spicy.

954
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,233
Let's see, macho man.

955
01:06:40,133 --> 01:06:42,100
Let's see, macho man.

956
01:06:47,667 --> 01:06:49,700
Let's see if he can handle the spiciness.

957
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:57,567
Is it not spicy?

958
01:06:58,166 --> 01:07:00,133
Oh, boy.

959
01:07:01,467 --> 01:07:02,667
They warned you.

960
01:07:11,266 --> 01:07:13,033
- It's good.
- It's good.

961
01:07:15,433 --> 01:07:16,533
It's good, right?

962
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:20,000
- It's good. It's really good.
- It is.

963
01:07:21,667 --> 01:07:23,700
Macho macho man

964
01:07:29,500 --> 01:07:30,533
So funny.

965
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:34,266
I feel like something's missing.

966
01:07:34,333 --> 01:07:35,166
Salt?

967
01:07:35,233 --> 01:07:36,300
I think it's okay.

968
01:07:36,333 --> 01:07:37,400
Is it?

969
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:39,667
I don't need salt.

970
01:07:39,734 --> 01:07:40,800
Or a spicy sauce?

971
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,600
Take some sauce from hellamyeon.

972
01:07:43,667 --> 01:07:47,100
Do you think
I can ask for some spicy sauce?

973
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:49,500
Excuse me.

974
01:07:50,266 --> 01:07:51,567
Do you have hot sauce?

975
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:52,633
- Hot sauce?
- Yes.

976
01:07:52,667 --> 01:07:56,333
We have a kind of spicy sauce.

977
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,633
- Do you want it?
- Yes.

978
01:07:58,400 --> 01:08:00,467
- What's up?
- They want some spicy sauce.

979
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,500
- They want spicy sauce.
- Spicy sauce?

980
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:04,333
All right. That's good.

981
01:08:07,367 --> 01:08:09,033
Macho, macho.

982
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:10,800
Macho, macho.

983
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,734
- Is it the same sauce?
- Yes.

984
01:08:12,734 --> 01:08:14,333
Thank you very much.

985
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:15,800
- Wow.
- Excellent.

986
01:08:19,333 --> 01:08:20,667
Isn't that sauce spicy?

987
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:21,734
They must love it.

988
01:08:21,767 --> 01:08:23,000
Isn't it super spicy?

989
01:08:24,734 --> 01:08:25,600
I wanna see it.

990
01:08:25,667 --> 01:08:28,300
Let's see how they like it.

991
01:08:29,333 --> 01:08:30,200
Just a little.

992
01:08:30,266 --> 01:08:32,000
Just a little more.

993
01:08:40,166 --> 01:08:41,200
It's good.

994
01:08:49,066 --> 01:08:50,467
Hey.

995
01:08:50,533 --> 01:08:52,567
- Is it okay?
- It's really good.

996
01:08:53,367 --> 01:08:55,467
- Wow.
- Wow.

997
01:08:56,767 --> 01:08:59,100
Macho macho man

998
01:09:05,533 --> 01:09:07,033
Give him more.

999
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,166
We should give him a whole bottle.

1000
01:09:18,433 --> 01:09:19,467
Do you want more?

1001
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:24,000
Very nice.

1002
01:09:24,066 --> 01:09:25,033
Thank you.

1003
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:32,800
Seo Jin's smile got 50 percent wider.

1004
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:36,233
"Why did you prep so many ingredients?"

1005
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:37,433
Then today...

1006
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:40,100
"Do we have more ingredients?"
He'll be like this.

1007
01:09:42,734 --> 01:09:44,000
What's up?

1008
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:47,266
- Your smile got 50 percent wider.
- Huh?

1009
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:49,066
Your smile got 50 percent wider.

1010
01:09:50,767 --> 01:09:52,066
Thank you.

1011
01:09:52,133 --> 01:09:53,233
It was very tasty.

1012
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:58,367
Gracias.

1013
01:10:04,767 --> 01:10:06,500
"Great food?"

1014
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,467
- Break time now?
- Yes.

1015
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:28,066
- Everything okay?
- Yes.

1016
01:10:28,667 --> 01:10:29,667
I'm relaxed.

1017
01:10:51,066 --> 01:10:53,467
- Seo Jin, how much did we make?
- Huh?

1018
01:10:53,533 --> 01:10:54,600
How much did we make?

1019
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,767
Come on. Keep going up.

1020
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:01,800
We made over 3,000.

1021
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:06,400
- It's 3,110.
- Nice.

1022
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:51,133
- I'd like to get this as a burrito.
- One burrito.

1023
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,200
- And one burrito with this.
- Okay.

1024
01:11:53,266 --> 01:11:57,533
And one burrito with this.

1025
01:11:58,166 --> 01:12:01,433
Oh, and can I have some tacos as well?

1026
01:12:07,300 --> 01:12:09,100
Gracias.

1027
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:21,300
Hey.

1028
01:12:24,333 --> 01:12:26,567
- Brother.
- Amigo.

1029
01:12:26,633 --> 01:12:29,033
Amigo.

1030
01:12:30,567 --> 01:12:31,734
What are those?

1031
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:34,333
Tacos, burritos...

1032
01:12:34,467 --> 01:12:35,800
It's...

1033
01:12:36,033 --> 01:12:38,133
- What are these?
- They're burritos.

1034
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:40,233
You bought so many. How much was it?

1035
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:41,533
It was about 450 pesos.

1036
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:42,600
- Only?
- Yes.

1037
01:12:44,633 --> 01:12:45,633
Is lunch here?

1038
01:12:45,633 --> 01:12:47,800
Yes, come and sit here.

1039
01:12:54,600 --> 01:12:56,800
Which one should I eat?

1040
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,667
Tae Hyung hates avocados.

1041
01:12:59,133 --> 01:13:00,800
So give this to Tae Hyung.

1042
01:13:01,000 --> 01:13:03,266
- Give that to him
- It has sausage inside.

1043
01:13:03,367 --> 01:13:05,166
This one doesn't have those inside.

1044
01:13:10,233 --> 01:13:12,133
That's the spicy one. This isn't.

1045
01:13:16,367 --> 01:13:17,367
It's cheap.

1046
01:13:18,734 --> 01:13:20,800
It's so much food for 450 pesos.

1047
01:13:21,033 --> 01:13:22,633
This is 450 pesos?

1048
01:13:23,333 --> 01:13:25,166
Maybe we should have dinner here.

1049
01:13:25,166 --> 01:13:26,400
- Let's do it today.
- Huh?

1050
01:13:26,433 --> 01:13:28,000
- We can do that.
- Why not?

1051
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:29,367
Dinner there tonight?

1052
01:13:31,133 --> 01:13:32,667
That looks delicious.

1053
01:13:32,734 --> 01:13:34,367
- Wanna eat out?
- We should.

1054
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:36,233
- Yes.
- Okay. I'll take us out.

1055
01:13:36,300 --> 01:13:37,734
We've only ate at home.

1056
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,233
Let's eat out tonight.

1057
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:43,633
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1058
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:45,433
Let's go.

1059
01:13:45,500 --> 01:13:48,166
- Go, Woo Shik.
- Go, Woo Shik.

1060
01:13:48,233 --> 01:13:50,033
- Go, Woo Shik.
- And this dance.

1061
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:51,633
- Go, Woo Shik.
- Go, Woo Shik.

1062
01:13:51,700 --> 01:13:54,000
Gosh, that's so old-school.

1063
01:13:55,567 --> 01:13:59,333
- Go, Yu Mi.
- Go, Yu Mi.

1064
01:14:07,667 --> 01:14:09,100
It's closed.

1065
01:14:13,000 --> 01:14:14,533
We're opening at 5 PM.

1066
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,400
At 5 PM? Okay.

1067
01:14:16,533 --> 01:14:18,433
You open at five?

1068
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:23,200
Now, we're closed for a break,
but we'll open again at five.

1069
01:14:23,333 --> 01:14:25,000
Okay, thank you.

1070
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:29,433
- Hello.
- Hola.

1071
01:14:30,100 --> 01:14:30,800
Hello.

1072
01:14:31,033 --> 01:14:32,133
Hola.

1073
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:36,633
Can we make a reservation
in 30 minutes or 1 hour?

1074
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:38,300
Sure. How many?

1075
01:14:38,367 --> 01:14:39,467
- Four.
- Four.

1076
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,633
Okay. What time?

1077
01:14:41,667 --> 01:14:45,133
- Quarter to six.
- Quarter to six.

1078
01:14:45,433 --> 01:14:47,200
I heard good stories of you.

1079
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,767
Oh, really? That's good.

1080
01:14:52,633 --> 01:14:53,667
So we're famous now.

1081
01:14:53,734 --> 01:14:55,467
We're famous.

1082
01:14:58,667 --> 01:15:00,000
So we keep a table empty?

1083
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,066
We should. With a reserved sign.

1084
01:15:02,133 --> 01:15:03,233
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

1085
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,300
I don't wanna mess it up.

1086
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:12,567
- Should I capitalize everything?
- No.

1087
01:15:15,133 --> 01:15:16,500
- Nice.
- Is it okay?

1088
01:15:33,567 --> 01:15:35,100
Have you danced before?

1089
01:15:37,133 --> 01:15:38,400
I was a dancer.

1090
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,200
I was famous in my town.

1091
01:15:49,533 --> 01:15:50,667
Who's this?

1092
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,367
Someone I used to work with.

1093
01:15:56,266 --> 01:15:57,467
But parted ways.

1094
01:16:05,166 --> 01:16:06,633
We're out of rice.

1095
01:16:06,633 --> 01:16:08,133
Should we cook some more?

1096
01:16:08,166 --> 01:16:09,700
- Do you want me to do it?
- Sure.

1097
01:16:09,767 --> 01:16:11,600
- Do you want it?
- I want it.

1098
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:13,400
- Do you want it?
- I want it.

1099
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,133
Yu Mi!

1100
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,633
Rice. We need rice.

1101
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:26,166
Rice first. The dishes can wait.

1102
01:16:26,667 --> 01:16:29,233
If we don't have rice,
we're in serious trouble.

1103
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:30,667
It'll be an emergency.

1104
01:16:32,333 --> 01:16:35,000
By the way,
when can we use our monthly leave?

1105
01:16:35,066 --> 01:16:35,667
Monthly?

1106
01:16:35,700 --> 01:16:37,500
He wants to use his monthly leave.

1107
01:16:37,533 --> 01:16:38,767
- Monthly leave?
- Yes.

1108
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:41,100
A monthly leave is for once a month.

1109
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:42,533
What about a weekly leave?

1110
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,800
Weekly leave?

1111
01:16:55,467 --> 01:16:56,600
I'll do it.

1112
01:17:06,133 --> 01:17:07,333
You must come back, okay?

1113
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,700
Make it quick.

1114
01:17:20,667 --> 01:17:22,734
- Three, two, one. Let's go!
- Let's go!

1115
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:25,400
I wonder how many people
will come from now.

1116
01:17:40,233 --> 01:17:41,133
Hola.

1117
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:42,133
Hola.

1118
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:44,166
- Hola.
- Hola.

1119
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:52,734
Looks nice.

1120
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:54,233
Order...

1121
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:55,467
Okay.

1122
01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:02,033
This is so cool.

1123
01:18:08,166 --> 01:18:09,767
Thank you.

1124
01:18:11,667 --> 01:18:16,200
Can we make a reservation
in 30 minutes or 1 hour?

1125
01:18:16,266 --> 01:18:17,133
Sure.

1126
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:21,266
They're coming.

1127
01:18:22,633 --> 01:18:24,734
Here comes the rush.

1128
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:26,200
Here comes the rush.

1129
01:18:29,066 --> 01:18:30,000
The first one.

1130
01:18:30,033 --> 01:18:32,300
- The first combo.
- One Combo A.

1131
01:18:32,400 --> 01:18:34,633
1 Combo A?

1132
01:18:34,700 --> 01:18:37,433
And mineral water. Thank you.

1133
01:18:47,767 --> 01:18:49,400
Thank you.

1134
01:18:50,266 --> 01:18:51,367
Thank you.

1135
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:55,734
We got an order.

1136
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:57,700
Yu Mi.

1137
01:18:58,667 --> 01:19:00,066
Combo.

1138
01:19:01,066 --> 01:19:02,300
Shall we get started?

1139
01:19:02,367 --> 01:19:03,467
Shall we get started?

1140
01:19:04,100 --> 01:19:05,400
1 Jinny's Combo A.

1141
01:19:05,467 --> 01:19:06,667
Let's make ramyeon.

1142
01:19:07,667 --> 01:19:08,767
Good luck, sir.

1143
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,533
I'm making so many ramyeons today.

1144
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:52,600
Bulgogi for the Combo.

1145
01:20:00,533 --> 01:20:02,133
Here, Woo Shik.

1146
01:20:08,333 --> 01:20:09,400
Ramyeon.

1147
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,000
Okay, nice.

1148
01:20:11,066 --> 01:20:12,200
Do I get chopsticks?

1149
01:20:17,433 --> 01:20:18,700
Okay. Thank you.

1150
01:20:18,767 --> 01:20:20,433
Nice.

1151
01:20:36,266 --> 01:20:37,667
I don't want something spicy.

1152
01:20:37,734 --> 01:20:41,033
Do you have non-spicy chicken
or fish dish?

1153
01:20:41,667 --> 01:20:43,166
Do you wanna try this one?

1154
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,367
This is chicken and rice.

1155
01:20:47,233 --> 01:20:48,767
Okay, I'll get this one.

1156
01:20:49,734 --> 01:20:51,600
- And for you?
- The...

1157
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:54,500
- Corn dog with the mozzarella.
- Okay.

1158
01:20:55,066 --> 01:20:55,800
Okay, one Coke.

1159
01:20:56,066 --> 01:20:58,433
- For you?
- Nothing.

1160
01:20:58,667 --> 01:21:00,000
Is this fricken rice?

1161
01:21:00,033 --> 01:21:00,767
Yes.

1162
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,000
Can I have one fricken rice, please?

1163
01:21:13,667 --> 01:21:15,633
Hey, man. Chill.

1164
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:19,400
- So you wanna get a fricken rice?
- Yes.

1165
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,467
Okay, one more fricken rice.

1166
01:21:22,533 --> 01:21:23,734
I want it too.

1167
01:21:23,800 --> 01:21:25,033
You too?

1168
01:21:27,400 --> 01:21:28,633
One original corn dog.

1169
01:21:28,667 --> 01:21:30,567
An original corn dog, okay.

1170
01:21:30,633 --> 01:21:31,767
One more?

1171
01:21:32,000 --> 01:21:34,066
And a sweet Korean...

1172
01:21:34,133 --> 01:21:35,266
Spicy fricken?

1173
01:21:35,333 --> 01:21:36,433
- Make it two?
- Yeah.

1174
01:21:36,767 --> 01:21:38,200
One more chicken?

1175
01:21:38,266 --> 01:21:40,533
And another corn dog, please.

1176
01:21:41,033 --> 01:21:44,200
- One original corn dog.
- And what kind of wine do you have?

1177
01:21:49,667 --> 01:21:51,767
That would be 1,390 pesos.

1178
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,767
We got an order.

1179
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,266
And it's huge.

1180
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:03,233
- Tae Hyung.
- Yes?

1181
01:22:03,300 --> 01:22:04,667
Gosh...

1182
01:22:05,333 --> 01:22:07,133
We got a big one.

1183
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:08,734
- And I mean, big.
- Okay.

1184
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,066
Corn dog.

1185
01:22:11,133 --> 01:22:13,100
Half & half tater dog.

1186
01:22:13,166 --> 01:22:14,300
Three originals.

1187
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:20,433
What's going on?
That's a lot of fricken rice.

1188
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:23,533
Rice, rice, chicken, chicken,
corn dog, corn dog, chicken...

1189
01:22:23,533 --> 01:22:26,266
- None are yours.
- Only Seo Jun can do those menus.

1190
01:22:26,333 --> 01:22:28,133
- No.
- Oh, my gosh.

1191
01:22:30,367 --> 01:22:32,400
Tae Hyung, let me do the dishes.

1192
01:22:32,467 --> 01:22:34,433
- Why?
- Go help him with the chicken.

1193
01:22:37,266 --> 01:22:39,200
What are her strengths?

1194
01:22:39,266 --> 01:22:40,300
She's meticulous.

1195
01:22:43,467 --> 01:22:46,500
- You clean there. I'll clean here.
- Okay.

1196
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,333
- We got three more orders?
- Yes.

1197
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:51,633
Do you need any help?

1198
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,166
Do you need water?

1199
01:22:58,000 --> 01:22:59,100
Oh, no.

1200
01:22:59,166 --> 01:23:00,066
Take this out.

1201
01:23:00,133 --> 01:23:01,433
I'll take care of it.

1202
01:23:08,066 --> 01:23:10,400
- Why?
- Go help him with the chicken.

1203
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:11,767
- Chicken?
- He's in trouble.

1204
01:23:11,767 --> 01:23:13,233
- Why?
- It's all Seo Jun's.

1205
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:15,133
Two fricken rice.

1206
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:16,233
Huh?

1207
01:23:18,333 --> 01:23:19,667
What happened here?

1208
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,467
Please, I want a rush.

1209
01:23:25,533 --> 01:23:27,133
I want a storm.

1210
01:23:37,033 --> 01:23:38,533
Maybe their tired from swimming.

1211
01:24:00,367 --> 01:24:03,333
- It's real.
- For real.

1212
01:24:25,033 --> 01:24:26,133
Honey, where's mine?

1213
01:24:26,133 --> 01:24:27,333
Sorry. I'll order it now.

1214
01:24:32,233 --> 01:24:35,433
- One Coke. Yes, please.
- One Coke.

1215
01:24:38,367 --> 01:24:40,200
It's really tasty. Try it.

1216
01:24:40,266 --> 01:24:41,600
Yeah? Let me try.

1217
01:24:41,667 --> 01:24:43,133
Have a seat. Let's see.

1218
01:24:48,333 --> 01:24:51,033
It's a little spicy.

1219
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:53,734
No, it's very spicy. It made my nose run.

1220
01:24:56,166 --> 01:24:57,467
- Is it spicy?
- It is.

1221
01:24:59,467 --> 01:25:00,467
Thank you.

1222
01:25:02,533 --> 01:25:04,266
I wanna eat more.

1223
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:13,500
Thank you.

1224
01:25:15,166 --> 01:25:16,266
No, not so much.

1225
01:25:24,567 --> 01:25:26,333
How is it?

1226
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:28,033
It's good.

1227
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:32,433
My nose got runny,
and I was like, "Oh, my gosh."

1228
01:25:33,700 --> 01:25:35,400
It's really good.

1229
01:25:37,734 --> 01:25:39,200
It's really tasty.

1230
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:42,166
It's good. I like it.

1231
01:25:45,066 --> 01:25:46,767
I should take a photo of this place.

1232
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:47,700
No.

1233
01:25:49,533 --> 01:25:51,166
Look here.

1234
01:25:53,166 --> 01:25:54,233
Up.

1235
01:26:02,333 --> 01:26:03,300
Yes, two servings.

1236
01:26:07,734 --> 01:26:09,266
The fifth one is on us.

1237
01:26:23,033 --> 01:26:23,800
Let's do this.

1238
01:26:24,033 --> 01:26:25,433
- Let's do this.
- We got this.

1239
01:26:25,467 --> 01:26:27,133
- Let's go, Seo Jun.
- Let's go.

1240
01:26:48,333 --> 01:26:49,767
Tae Hyung, could you finish

1241
01:26:49,767 --> 01:26:52,567
- the half & half tater dog afterward?
- Will do.

1242
01:27:00,033 --> 01:27:02,033
Are you guys sharing?

1243
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:04,133
- Yes, we're gonna share it.
- Okay.

1244
01:27:04,567 --> 01:27:06,400
- I'll put it in the middle.
- Thanks.

1245
01:27:10,567 --> 01:27:12,033
That chicken looks so good.

1246
01:27:14,066 --> 01:27:16,100
Should we order something like that too?

1247
01:27:17,567 --> 01:27:19,166
- Should we?
- Yes.

1248
01:27:27,800 --> 01:27:29,133
It's so good.

1249
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:30,433
It's really good.

1250
01:27:32,033 --> 01:27:33,433
It's perfectly spicy.

1251
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:35,667
It's good spicy.

1252
01:27:35,734 --> 01:27:37,433
It's well-balanced.

1253
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:40,000
Half & half tater dog.

1254
01:28:00,100 --> 01:28:01,500
Thank you.

1255
01:28:01,567 --> 01:28:03,266
I have a question.

1256
01:28:03,333 --> 01:28:06,133
Can we order that chicken too?

1257
01:28:06,200 --> 01:28:07,100
Oh, yeah?

1258
01:28:07,166 --> 01:28:08,367
Well...

1259
01:28:08,433 --> 01:28:11,166
It'll take a little longer though.

1260
01:28:11,233 --> 01:28:12,567
- No problem.
- I see.

1261
01:28:12,633 --> 01:28:14,233
Then...

1262
01:28:14,300 --> 01:28:15,333
you have to pay first.

1263
01:28:15,400 --> 01:28:17,000
I'll put the order in.

1264
01:28:19,567 --> 01:28:21,567
Fricken rice and half & half are out.

1265
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:24,433
- We have three fricken rice left?
- Yes.

1266
01:28:24,500 --> 01:28:27,333
Start on the corn dogs
when I'm almost done with this.

1267
01:28:31,500 --> 01:28:33,467
I can make three fried rice at once.

1268
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:40,767
We got one more spicy fricken.

1269
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:42,200
I'll do it.

1270
01:28:43,300 --> 01:28:45,400
Tae Hyung, can you do
the corn dogs first?

1271
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,500
- It looks so good.
- It does look really good.

1272
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:01,033
It's weird. It has sugar on.

1273
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:04,100
It's good though.

1274
01:29:05,433 --> 01:29:06,567
It's tasty.

1275
01:29:14,333 --> 01:29:16,433
It's really good.

1276
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,367
I think I can order some more.

1277
01:29:18,433 --> 01:29:19,800
I'm not kidding.

1278
01:29:20,467 --> 01:29:22,333
Seriously, you should have this.

1279
01:29:27,166 --> 01:29:29,000
Seriously, it's crazily good.

1280
01:29:38,600 --> 01:29:39,600
Crazy, right?

1281
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:42,400
It's amazing.

1282
01:29:48,166 --> 01:29:50,000
Hola. How many?

1283
01:29:50,467 --> 01:29:52,033
- Six.
- Six?

1284
01:30:09,066 --> 01:30:10,467
Two?

1285
01:30:11,633 --> 01:30:14,433
I think you'll have to wait
for more than 30 minutes.

1286
01:30:14,500 --> 01:30:16,567
Can we just wait here and have a drink?

1287
01:30:16,633 --> 01:30:18,033
We can have a drink here.

1288
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:20,133
Yea, sure.

1289
01:30:23,033 --> 01:30:23,734
Here you go.

1290
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:24,800
Thank you.

1291
01:30:25,033 --> 01:30:27,166
- Sorry to keep you waiting.
- No, it's fine.

1292
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:28,567
We're happy.

1293
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:40,600
We'd like to have one of this

1294
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:41,734
and this, please.

1295
01:30:46,166 --> 01:30:47,300
Which one? Original?

1296
01:30:47,367 --> 01:30:48,333
One original.

1297
01:30:49,500 --> 01:30:51,100
Woo Shik, serve this first.

1298
01:30:51,166 --> 01:30:52,266
One tater dog...

1299
01:30:57,433 --> 01:31:00,467
Is it okay
if I put the chair here and sit?

1300
01:31:00,533 --> 01:31:01,600
Yes?

1301
01:31:03,033 --> 01:31:04,066
Sorry, excuse me...

1302
01:31:04,133 --> 01:31:05,533
No, I mean... Disculpe.

1303
01:31:05,567 --> 01:31:08,734
Woo Shik, he asks if he could sit there.
Could you talk to him?

1304
01:31:09,133 --> 01:31:10,533
- Hi.
- We're out of chairs.

1305
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:15,367
We're out of chairs.

1306
01:31:20,166 --> 01:31:22,000
We got an order.

1307
01:31:23,000 --> 01:31:24,000
Huh?

1308
01:31:25,767 --> 01:31:26,633
Huh?

1309
01:31:26,700 --> 01:31:28,000
Is it a new order?

1310
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,567
Tuna gimbap and bulgogi gimbap.

1311
01:31:32,633 --> 01:31:33,533
What's this?

1312
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,333
- Is this a new order?
- Yes.

1313
01:31:36,333 --> 01:31:37,300
What's this?

1314
01:31:37,367 --> 01:31:38,333
That's an order too.

1315
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:40,066
- They're all new?
- Yes.

1316
01:31:45,233 --> 01:31:47,000
Gosh, busier than the weekend.

1317
01:31:48,567 --> 01:31:50,266
Darn it.

1318
01:31:50,333 --> 01:31:51,467
This is too much.

1319
01:31:52,633 --> 01:31:55,333
This is the toughest moment in my life.

1320
01:31:55,400 --> 01:31:56,266
You're lying.

1321
01:31:57,400 --> 01:31:58,767
Here comes the rush.

1322
01:31:59,000 --> 01:32:01,100
Really? Already?

1323
01:32:01,166 --> 01:32:02,100
We got an order.

1324
01:32:02,166 --> 01:32:03,133
Order.

1325
01:32:03,166 --> 01:32:04,100
Order.

1326
01:32:07,266 --> 01:32:09,367
Did we get famous here? What's going on?

1327
01:32:10,233 --> 01:32:12,333
People keep rushing in.

1328
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:13,767
We have a queue again.

1329
01:32:18,767 --> 01:32:21,033
- Three servings of chicken.
- Really?

1330
01:32:21,100 --> 01:32:22,734
Too many ramyeons.

1331
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,133
Half & half tater dog to go.

1332
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,367
We have only one serving of chicken left.

1333
01:32:29,734 --> 01:32:31,066
But today is a weekday.

1334
01:32:31,066 --> 01:32:32,633
There must be a word about us.

1335
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:34,667
This is bad.

1336
01:32:34,734 --> 01:32:37,000
One more thing to do to be promoted.

1337
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:38,100
It's speed.

1338
01:32:38,166 --> 01:32:39,266
I'm gonna show you.

1339
01:32:44,200 --> 01:32:45,367
Watching the corn dogs.

1340
01:32:45,433 --> 01:32:47,533
- Smart decision.
- Smart decision.

1341
01:32:49,667 --> 01:32:51,667
Our teamwork is getting better.

1342
01:32:51,734 --> 01:32:53,767
- Are you okay?
- Okay.

1343
01:32:54,000 --> 01:32:57,633
- Vámonos!
- Vámonos!

1344
01:32:58,033 --> 01:32:59,200
It's over 5,000 pesos.

1345
01:32:59,233 --> 01:33:00,266
- Over 5,000?
- Yes.

1346
01:33:00,333 --> 01:33:02,667
I feel like we made 10,000 pesos.

1347
01:33:02,734 --> 01:33:04,133
Ten thousand pesos.

1348
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:06,266
- Was that the last order? Done?
- Done.

1349
01:33:06,333 --> 01:33:07,166
Close the door.

1350
01:33:09,100 --> 01:33:10,433
- Yu Mi.
- Yes?

1351
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:12,600
Do you still dream of being an actress?

1352
01:33:12,667 --> 01:33:14,667
Me? Right now, I have no dreams.

1353
01:33:14,700 --> 01:33:16,033
You said you wanted to.

1354
01:33:16,033 --> 01:33:17,266
I forgot about it.

1355
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,734
Do you still wanna star in a Marvel movie?

1356
01:33:22,800 --> 01:33:24,600
- No.
- Then?

1357
01:33:24,667 --> 01:33:26,133
I wanna be the owner here.

1358
01:34:09,333 --> 01:34:12,533
