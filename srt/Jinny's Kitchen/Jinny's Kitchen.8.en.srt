00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:25,900
JINNY'S KITCHEN

2
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,500
Adios.

3
00:00:28,033 --> 00:00:29,100
My legs.

4
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,033
I literally used up all my energy.

5
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,900
So this is what they say
using up all energy is like.

6
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,533
Now, I'm starting to forget
what my job was.

7
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:40,266
I have no appetite.

8
00:00:40,333 --> 00:00:41,467
You guys…

9
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:43,033
Sleep well. Do what you want.

10
00:00:43,066 --> 00:00:45,734
This is youth!

11
00:00:50,033 --> 00:00:51,433
Let's go.

12
00:00:56,533 --> 00:00:59,700
It feels so good
to go to work at this time.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,200
No rush, right?

14
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:03,567
Wait, is that a queue?

15
00:01:03,667 --> 00:01:05,600
Already?

16
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:06,667
No way.

17
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,867
Oh, they're our customers
from the other day.

18
00:01:14,934 --> 00:01:16,233
They came the other day?

19
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:19,033
Hola.

20
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,633
- Hello.
- Can we make a reservation?

21
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:22,867
What time?

22
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:24,967
- At five o' clock.
- Five o' clock?

23
00:01:25,166 --> 00:01:26,400
Okay. How many?

24
00:01:28,066 --> 00:01:30,433
- Six.
- Six? Okay.

25
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,834
Six? At five o'clock?

26
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:34,567
Okay. See you later.

27
00:01:34,734 --> 00:01:36,533
- At five?
- Yes.

28
00:01:37,133 --> 00:01:39,500
We just arrived,
and we have a reservation.

29
00:01:39,567 --> 00:01:41,333
Perro is also here already.

30
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:43,734
Perro?

31
00:01:43,834 --> 00:01:44,967
Perro is here.

32
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:01,133
- Hey, buddy.
- You came even earlier than us.

33
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:04,734
Thanks.

34
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,600
Let's put this on too.

35
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:09,500
Put on what?

36
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:13,033
Oh.

37
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:25,300
Putting it there? Put it here.

38
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:27,066
I wanna be unique.

39
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,066
Hello.

40
00:02:39,967 --> 00:02:40,867
Hola.

41
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:47,300
I just clocked in,
and I feel so lazy already.

42
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,233
Gosh, I don't wanna work.

43
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,467
We have three reservations already.

44
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:05,633
Let's add one more table.

45
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,734
I thought we were adding that
on our last day.

46
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,433
We have a booking for a party of six.

47
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,433
Let's go.

48
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,800
Mozzarella.

49
00:03:45,033 --> 00:03:46,967
Why aren't you skewering them?

50
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,433
If I have them skewered in advance,
the cheese will fall apart.

51
00:03:50,533 --> 00:03:52,133
So there's been
a change of plan.

52
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,700
I'll skewer it
before rolling it in the batter.

53
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,100
All right. Let's go!

54
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,166
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

55
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:15,533
Done.

56
00:04:20,467 --> 00:04:25,133
Let's cook rice, rice, rice

57
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,333
How do you measure it accurately?

58
00:04:29,367 --> 00:04:32,166
See the knuckle sticking out here?

59
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:33,867
The water should be here.

60
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,700
In the middle of the knuckle.
It always works.

61
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Looking good.

62
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:44,700
PASS

63
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:48,734
Man, the rice is gonna be so tasty today.

64
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,834
You can feel it?

65
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:52,033
Yes, I can feel it.

66
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:19,934
Tell me if you need anything.

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,867
Intern Kim is at your service.

68
00:05:21,934 --> 00:05:22,867
Excuse me.

69
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:24,967
Okay. Intern Choi is prepared too.

70
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:28,133
We need more marinade for the spicy pork.

71
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:29,266
Yes, ma'am.

72
00:05:29,367 --> 00:05:31,367
And the marinade for bulgogi too.

73
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:34,200
Because we're making bulgogi rice too.

74
00:05:43,033 --> 00:05:45,867
I was thinking
we could add menus like spicy pork rice.

75
00:05:45,934 --> 00:05:47,867
We're almost done, so I'll do both.

76
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,834
Go Yu Mi, go Yu Mi

77
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,567
You know what to recommend.

78
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:55,633
Yes.

79
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,967
- Spicy pork rice and bulgogi rice.
- Yes.

80
00:05:59,066 --> 00:06:00,133
And chibap.

81
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:02,033
- Chibap, too?
- Yes.

82
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:04,233
The menus that are over 200 pesos.

83
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:16,233
- Is this good?
- Yes.

84
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,967
- Yu Mi.
- Yes?

85
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:22,767
The rice is done. Wanna check it?

86
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:26,400
Oh, my gosh.

87
00:06:32,166 --> 00:06:34,867
My gimbap knife is the best.

88
00:06:43,433 --> 00:06:44,700
Gosh, my eyes.

89
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,233
Very fresh.

90
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,834
You look too sexy.

91
00:07:35,767 --> 00:07:37,734
Good. Sleep well.

92
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:41,600
We just need to wait for a little, right?

93
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,166
Want some ice cream?

94
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:18,300
Ice cream!

95
00:08:23,767 --> 00:08:24,767
What's that?

96
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:27,233
He's buying us some ice cream.

97
00:08:27,934 --> 00:08:29,700
The boss is buying us ice cream.

98
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,266
- Really?
- The boss has changed.

99
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:33,533
He's changed.

100
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:38,166
What is this?

101
00:08:38,233 --> 00:08:40,800
Coconut, cookies & cream,
chocolate, and strawberry.

102
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:41,934
Which flavor?

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,266
Coconut? Cookies and cream?

104
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:48,367
He has coconut
and cookies and cream flavors.

105
00:08:48,467 --> 00:08:49,367
Cookies and cream!

106
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:51,834
- Cookies and cream!
- I want cookies and cream!

107
00:08:51,934 --> 00:08:54,266
Three cookies and cream!

108
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,533
Three cookies & cream.

109
00:08:55,633 --> 00:08:57,066
And one coconut for me.

110
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,567
Oh, there's another flavor.

111
00:08:58,667 --> 00:08:59,633
It's strawberry.

112
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,133
- Yes, one.
- Strawberry?

113
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,734
Okay, now the cookies and cream.

114
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,233
Three cookies and cream?

115
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,700
Coconut flavor is unique.
It's not a common flavor.

116
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:15,967
Thank you.

117
00:09:18,033 --> 00:09:19,033
Thank you.

118
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,567
- Here it is.
- Woa, look.

119
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,166
Okay. Let's go!

120
00:09:33,233 --> 00:09:34,967
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

121
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,233
What's this?

122
00:09:51,066 --> 00:09:52,467
Do you like it?

123
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,367
- Yes.
- I like it.

124
00:09:58,133 --> 00:09:59,166
- You like it?
- Sorry?

125
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,000
- Do you like it?
- Yes. I love it.

126
00:10:03,767 --> 00:10:04,834
What time is it now?

127
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:05,900
It's 4:30 PM.

128
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,266
Only 30 minutes left.

129
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:25,834
Wait. We don't need to prep
laver rolls and dumplings.

130
00:10:25,967 --> 00:10:27,266
For tteokbokki.

131
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:30,000
Since we're not making tteokbokki today…

132
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,734
I'll take this out…

133
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,834
Mix it and…

134
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:59,100
Ice sure gives it a richer flavor.

135
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,900
I'll make one now.

136
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay.

137
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,700
It's our new menu, so we'll need a sample.

138
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Okay.

139
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,066
- Is that good?
- Yes.

140
00:11:34,266 --> 00:11:35,333
Whoa, I'm sweating.

141
00:11:45,133 --> 00:11:47,033
Man, it looks amazing.

142
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,800
Even I wanna try it.

143
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,767
It's good.

144
00:11:53,834 --> 00:11:55,033
- Is it all right?
- Yes.

145
00:12:05,633 --> 00:12:06,800
I'll open.

146
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,133
- Okay.
- Okay.

147
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,800
- Is he asleep?
- No.

148
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,133
- Hola.
- Can we go in?

149
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:42,233
Yes.

150
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,066
We have a reservation.

151
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,533
Oh, really? At five.

152
00:12:45,633 --> 00:12:47,367
Okay. For two?

153
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,967
- Yes.
- Okay, come on in.

154
00:12:52,133 --> 00:12:53,066
Manuel?

155
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:54,000
Manuel?

156
00:12:54,066 --> 00:12:55,400
Yes, that's us.

157
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:57,367
Hello.

158
00:12:57,433 --> 00:12:58,633
¿Cómo estás?

159
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,300
- Good.
- Good.

160
00:13:01,133 --> 00:13:03,066
It's so pretty here.

161
00:13:03,133 --> 00:13:04,133
Nice.

162
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,133
We have customers.

163
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,200
- Tae Hyung. Let's do this.
- Do this.

164
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:10,533
- Seo Jun.
- Yes?

165
00:13:10,633 --> 00:13:12,567
- Let's do this.
- We can do this.

166
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:13,900
- We can do this.
- Yes.

167
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,834
We have a mountain of chicken today.

168
00:13:15,934 --> 00:13:16,834
Right.

169
00:13:22,734 --> 00:13:25,000
Please order here.

170
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:26,467
- Oh, we order there.
- Okay.

171
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:35,734
What's your recommendation?

172
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:37,567
Uhm…

173
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:40,934
Today's special is the rice menus.

174
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,400
Rice with…

175
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:45,700
Beef, pork, or chicken.

176
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:56,600
And this is chibap. It's chicken.

177
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:58,700
Okay, hmm...

178
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:00,066
This one's good.

179
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:01,800
- Ramyeon..
- Yes.

180
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,600
- Recommend the rice menus.
- Do you like spicy food?

181
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:07,633
- This is spicy.
- Rice. Recommend the rice menus.

182
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,667
If you like spicy, this one's good too.

183
00:14:10,734 --> 00:14:12,066
I'll have this.

184
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:13,433
Okay.

185
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:15,600
Is it very spicy?

186
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes, very spicy.

187
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,367
I'm gonna try the ramyeon.

188
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,433
- The regular ramyeon? Okay.
- Yes.

189
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:23,433
- Do you have drinks too?
- To drink?

190
00:14:23,533 --> 00:14:25,767
- The drink menus.
- I'll have mineral water.

191
00:14:25,834 --> 00:14:28,667
- Mineral water.
- Two. Two mineral water.

192
00:14:29,633 --> 00:14:31,667
We're having a rush again.

193
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,400
- We got an order.
- Okay.

194
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:37,600
Spicy pork rice. Wow.

195
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,166
And one regular ramyeon.

196
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:17,400
Mucho picante.

197
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:18,934
- Really?
- Yes.

198
00:15:19,734 --> 00:15:21,266
- Is it very spicy?
- Yes.

199
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,433
I feel like I'm stuck at this ramyeonland.

200
00:15:53,934 --> 00:15:55,333
Hola.

201
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,700
How many?

202
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:58,233
- Three.
- Three.

203
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,333
Chicken, very spicy.

204
00:16:10,033 --> 00:16:11,233
Hello. Two?

205
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,700
What should I order?

206
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:53,667
This looks good.

207
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,967
The chicken is very tasty.

208
00:16:56,967 --> 00:16:58,934
Should we order one? Let's share it.

209
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,767
A hellamyeon?

210
00:17:02,834 --> 00:17:04,033
Can I order a corn dog?

211
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:05,266
Sure. Go for it.

212
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:06,700
The potato one?

213
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,700
Yes.

214
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,834
Okay, the potato one?

215
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,033
Anything to drink?

216
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:13,834
Two cokes? Okay.

217
00:17:34,266 --> 00:17:35,467
- Hi.
- Hi.

218
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:38,600
One hellamyeon.

219
00:17:40,967 --> 00:17:42,667
- Two.
- Oh, two?

220
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:44,400
Oh, okay.

221
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,867
- Drink?
- Drink?

222
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:47,266
I'll have water.

223
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,700
- Just water?
- Yes.

224
00:17:59,934 --> 00:18:02,734
- Thank you.
- Take this to your table.

225
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:09,500
An order.

226
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:10,567
Okay.

227
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,834
- Tae Hyung.
- Yes.

228
00:18:13,934 --> 00:18:15,166
Time to work.

229
00:18:15,266 --> 00:18:16,967
- Is it chicken?
- Chicken.

230
00:18:32,433 --> 00:18:34,266
Is it half & half?

231
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:36,033
A half & half tater dog.

232
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:38,166
I feel like

233
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,500
I'm speaking faster than before.

234
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,233
And half more spoon.

235
00:19:05,767 --> 00:19:07,066
It smells so delicious.

236
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,166
She's got really nice skin.

237
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:45,633
She's so pretty.

238
00:19:46,233 --> 00:19:48,200
You'd look pretty there too.

239
00:19:48,266 --> 00:19:51,133
Oh, come on. No way.

240
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,600
You think I look pretty too?

241
00:19:57,333 --> 00:19:59,300
Of course.

242
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,500
Could you put the phone away?

243
00:20:12,133 --> 00:20:14,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

244
00:20:15,934 --> 00:20:17,333
- Thank you.
- Sure.

245
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,834
Let's see how spicy it is.

246
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:21,166
Thank you.

247
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:28,734
It's so good.

248
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,800
It's really spicy, but good.

249
00:20:46,066 --> 00:20:48,500
It's getting spicier and spicier, huh?

250
00:20:54,033 --> 00:20:55,033
It smells good.

251
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,700
Look. It's boiling.

252
00:20:58,467 --> 00:20:59,867
It looks delicious.

253
00:21:29,967 --> 00:21:32,166
Did you get a receipt?

254
00:21:32,266 --> 00:21:34,300
No, they didn't give it to me.

255
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,500
Did you want it?

256
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,233
They usually give it to you.

257
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,900
It's a pretty restaurant.

258
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:50,000
Yeah.

259
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,166
Hey, can you finish up the tater dog?

260
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:22,100
Sure.

261
00:22:57,333 --> 00:22:58,900
Con papas.

262
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:02,834
- Let's share it.
- Of course.

263
00:23:03,667 --> 00:23:04,800
Try it.

264
00:23:04,834 --> 00:23:05,867
Tell us how it is.

265
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,633
The chicken is so good.

266
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:16,433
It's really good.

267
00:23:19,433 --> 00:23:21,367
- Can I bite it off?
- Yes.

268
00:23:27,033 --> 00:23:28,567
Want some more?

269
00:23:28,633 --> 00:23:30,266
I'll have one more. It's good.

270
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:32,066
Yeah, it's really good.

271
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,000
There's a sausage inside.

272
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,867
At the bottom.

273
00:23:51,767 --> 00:23:54,133
That corn dog looks really good.

274
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:57,667
Oh, I heard that corn dog is a must-try.

275
00:23:57,767 --> 00:23:58,667
How is it? Good?

276
00:23:58,734 --> 00:24:00,967
- It's so good.
- It's good.

277
00:24:02,834 --> 00:24:05,066
This chicken is incredibly good.

278
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:07,633
- It's sweet.
- And crispy.

279
00:24:08,166 --> 00:24:09,333
What did you order?

280
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,633
Ramyeon.

281
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,500
Ramyeon. I ordered…

282
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:15,066
Today's special.

283
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:19,266
There's pork, chili, and veggies inside.

284
00:24:19,367 --> 00:24:21,834
It's tasty, but very spicy.

285
00:24:21,934 --> 00:24:22,934
Super spicy.

286
00:24:23,033 --> 00:24:24,300
I want spicy food too.

287
00:24:34,734 --> 00:24:35,734
Hellamyeon.

288
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,400
Mmm...

289
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,567
Isn't it spicy?

290
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,033
Yes, a little bit.

291
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,967
It's not that spicy.

292
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:00,700
Because it has cheese inside.

293
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,734
I think my nose is getting runny.

294
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,233
It started to hit me now.

295
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,233
And she said it wasn't spicy.

296
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:22,767
Now it's spicy.

297
00:25:24,667 --> 00:25:25,700
Finally.

298
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,400
She can't handle it anymore.

299
00:25:46,433 --> 00:25:48,667
They're coming too late,
we gotta cancel it.

300
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:07,667
Could you put the reserved sign away?

301
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:33,967
Leave the corn cheese to me.

302
00:26:34,066 --> 00:26:35,934
I'll prepare it here.

303
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:36,934
Okay.

304
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,400
Hellamyeon?

305
00:27:41,567 --> 00:27:43,300
It's spicy.

306
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,500
Spicy?

307
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,166
Thank you.

308
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:47,266
Thank you.

309
00:27:49,133 --> 00:27:50,333
You think it's spicy?

310
00:27:50,333 --> 00:27:51,667
I don't know. Let's see.

311
00:27:58,533 --> 00:28:00,266
It's really good.

312
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:02,200
It's spicy, but good.

313
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:03,300
It's not so spicy.

314
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,500
It's not that spicy.

315
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:12,266
Look at you.
You're eating with the chopsticks.

316
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:13,200
Yes.

317
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:28,667
What happened? Your glasses fell.

318
00:28:58,166 --> 00:29:00,300
Can I borrow some cash
to get more water?

319
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:01,934
Sure.

320
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:05,000
Is it spicy?

321
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:08,834
It's really good, but also very spicy.

322
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:12,133
It must be spicy for him too.

323
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,200
I'll pay you back after.

324
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,967
- Are you okay?
- Give him two water.

325
00:29:21,066 --> 00:29:22,200
It's really good.

326
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

327
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,533
I can do this.

328
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:35,000
You're sweating.

329
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:39,066
Do you wanna make
an extra order for to-go?

330
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,967
I'm gonna order something for my friend.

331
00:29:43,133 --> 00:29:45,500
Can I order an extra corn dog to-go?

332
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:46,567
- For to-go?
- Yes.

333
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:49,967
Looks like you can take away the food too.

334
00:29:50,033 --> 00:29:51,633
Let's order one to-go.

335
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,266
Should we get one or two?

336
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:56,266
Of which one?

337
00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:57,400
That.

338
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,066
What's it called?

339
00:29:59,166 --> 00:30:00,600
It's at the end of the menu.

340
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,333
A corn dog made with potatoes and cheese.

341
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:10,767
Is it "order to-go" or "take out?"

342
00:30:10,834 --> 00:30:13,633
It's "take out."
But "order to-go" is fine too.

343
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,967
Excuse me.

344
00:30:15,033 --> 00:30:16,567
What's that called by the way?

345
00:30:16,633 --> 00:30:19,633
The one at the end,
with potatoes and cheese.

346
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:24,800
I'd like to order the tater dog to-go.

347
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,300
- Two of it.
- Two?

348
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:29,133
- To-go?
- Yes, to-go.

349
00:30:29,233 --> 00:30:30,800
- Two? Okay.
- Two.

350
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:34,266
- Two please, two to-go.
- Two?

351
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:36,900
- Corn dog? To-go?
- Yes.

352
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:44,166
- Tae Hyung.
- Yes.

353
00:30:44,233 --> 00:30:45,867
- To-go.
- Okay.

354
00:30:45,934 --> 00:30:48,700
Two half & half tater dogs to-go.

355
00:30:48,767 --> 00:30:49,667
To-go?

356
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,333
Another to-go order.

357
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,433
Okay.

358
00:30:54,266 --> 00:30:55,767
An order.

359
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:57,266
Tae Hyung, one more to-go.

360
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,600
Why are there so many?

361
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:02,100
Corn dogs are flying off the shelves.

362
00:31:03,133 --> 00:31:05,000
Tater dogs.

363
00:31:24,567 --> 00:31:26,433
It tastes richer because it's iced.

364
00:31:28,767 --> 00:31:30,033
Here they are.

365
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,166
Nice.

366
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,467
Tae Hyung, they went in in this order.

367
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:36,367
Pack those three.

368
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:43,300
Just press the button once more.

369
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,567
What… But there are…

370
00:31:44,633 --> 00:31:46,967
There are four buttons. Which one?

371
00:31:47,033 --> 00:31:48,767
Which button do you mean?

372
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,734
I don't know. Let's try all four.

373
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,166
What did you press before?

374
00:31:54,333 --> 00:31:55,967
Wait. We need to take them out.

375
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,767
That one.

376
00:32:12,667 --> 00:32:14,266
- Tae Hyung.
- Yes.

377
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:15,734
The boxes. Oh, you got it.

378
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:16,734
Yes, I do.

379
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:25,800
- Very nice, Tae Hyung.
- Thanks.

380
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,700
Whoa, what's this?

381
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,300
- Nice.
- Nice.

382
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,767
Corn dogs to-go.

383
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,400
Here you go. I'll put it here.

384
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:00,567
Thank you.

385
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,900
Here you go.

386
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:05,166
Are you finished?

387
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,233
Yes.

388
00:33:11,433 --> 00:33:13,066
- Done?
- Done.

389
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,033
Hola.

390
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,834
- How many?
- Hello. We're two.

391
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,600
- Two? Please order here.
- Yes.

392
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:38,633
What do you wanna have?

393
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,567
I don't know.
Bulgogi gimbap, fried tofu gimbap…

394
00:33:42,834 --> 00:33:45,834
Bulgogi gimbap is really good.

395
00:33:45,934 --> 00:33:47,400
Very delicious.

396
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,266
This is good too. Chibap.

397
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:50,967
It's chicken with rice.

398
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:54,667
Does cheese ramyeon have seafood inside?

399
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:56,633
Fish?

400
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,033
- No?
- No fish.

401
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,967
Then we'll get one bulgogi gimbap

402
00:34:01,033 --> 00:34:03,266
and one cheese ramyeon.

403
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:12,734
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

404
00:34:19,867 --> 00:34:21,800
- Hello.
- Hello.

405
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:23,300
Here for a reservation?

406
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,467
Yes.

407
00:34:24,567 --> 00:34:26,300
At 5:30 PM, right?

408
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,266
Yes.

409
00:34:27,367 --> 00:34:28,233
Four? Five?

410
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:30,200
- Four? Okay.
- Four.

411
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,767
Please order here.

412
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:39,166
It's Korean food, right?

413
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:40,233
Yes.

414
00:34:40,867 --> 00:34:43,066
Does any of them come with kimchi?

415
00:34:43,133 --> 00:34:44,266
Kimchi?

416
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,333
Then you wanna order chibap.

417
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,400
- Chibap?
- It comes with kimchi.

418
00:34:48,467 --> 00:34:49,700
Like this.

419
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:52,967
- That's how it looks?
- Yes.

420
00:34:53,066 --> 00:34:54,967
Then I'll have that one.

421
00:34:55,066 --> 00:34:58,133
Should we try this chicken?

422
00:34:58,233 --> 00:34:59,734
Hellaspicy fricken?

423
00:34:59,834 --> 00:35:01,567
Yes, hellaspicy fricken.

424
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,867
Are you going with that? It's very spicy.

425
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:05,166
Is it really spicy?

426
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:06,734
Maybe not for you.

427
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,834
For Mexicans, right?

428
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:11,100
I want it really, really spicy.

429
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:13,734
- Hellspicy fricken.
- Yes.

430
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:16,867
Wasn't there spicy noodles?

431
00:35:16,934 --> 00:35:18,734
A regular ramyeon, please.

432
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,500
How's this?

433
00:35:20,567 --> 00:35:22,600
It's good.

434
00:35:23,533 --> 00:35:24,633
Our signature menu.

435
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:28,100
- One of this.
- Bulgogi gimbap.

436
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:31,700
One coke, two waters,
and one mineral water.

437
00:35:31,734 --> 00:35:34,066
- And a Sprite.
- So, five drinks?

438
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:38,433
And take this to your table.

439
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,767
I love Korean food.

440
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:42,800
Do you smell the food?

441
00:35:43,233 --> 00:35:47,133
I can smell sesame oil from the kitchen.

442
00:35:48,433 --> 00:35:50,934
It smells like sesame oil.

443
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,133
What did you order?

444
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:55,300
A soup, a chicken, and something else.

445
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,967
Sweet and spicy chicken?

446
00:35:57,033 --> 00:35:58,367
Yes, it's spicy.

447
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:04,800
- Water?
- Thank you.

448
00:36:04,934 --> 00:36:05,900
Thank you.

449
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,033
Sorry.

450
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,600
Don't worry. We're fine.

451
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:12,767
- In the middle like this.
- Thank you.

452
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:14,967
Professionally.

453
00:36:15,033 --> 00:36:16,533
Oh, do you work in this area?

454
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,200
I'm the waiter today.

455
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,700
It looks so delicious.

456
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,867
You want some?

457
00:37:22,934 --> 00:37:25,033
You had three packs yesterday.

458
00:37:27,333 --> 00:37:29,367
Your ramyeon is amazing.

459
00:37:29,433 --> 00:37:30,800
I'll make you one later.

460
00:37:46,734 --> 00:37:47,734
For the bronze.

461
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,967
Bulgogi.

462
00:37:52,533 --> 00:37:53,533
Ramyeon.

463
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,233
- It's huge.
- What if it's spicy?

464
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,934
I don't think I can eat it then.

465
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,533
Goodness, it looks really hot.

466
00:38:10,734 --> 00:38:11,734
This…

467
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,367
The cheese is really good.

468
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:18,567
- This sauce is so thick.
- So Mexican.

469
00:38:18,667 --> 00:38:21,934
Try it with the fork
and see if it's spicy.

470
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,066
It's so good.

471
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,433
I like it.

472
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,633
I wanna try it too.
How did you pick it up?

473
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,233
- With the fork.
- Give me one.

474
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,800
Come closer to my plate.

475
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,266
The one on the top is really good.

476
00:38:49,367 --> 00:38:51,800
- The sauce.
- Right?

477
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:55,000
Try picking it up with the chopsticks.

478
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,767
- It'll all fall apart.
- Just try it.

479
00:38:58,266 --> 00:38:59,734
Try yours with chopsticks.

480
00:38:59,734 --> 00:39:02,066
It'll be easier with the noodles.

481
00:39:02,633 --> 00:39:04,734
I wanna try eating that with chopsticks.

482
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,633
Look. This is easier.

483
00:39:15,734 --> 00:39:17,200
That's incredible.

484
00:39:24,934 --> 00:39:26,500
Enough. Let me eat.

485
00:39:28,533 --> 00:39:30,500
I took one when you're eating it.

486
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:35,200
- One chibap.
- Hellaspicy fricken.

487
00:39:35,266 --> 00:39:36,867
- Are they all drinks?
- Yes.

488
00:39:36,934 --> 00:39:38,967
I'll make it less confusing.

489
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:45,834
Chibap, chicken, ramyeon.

490
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:48,233
I'll make chibap first and then ramyeon.

491
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:50,033
We got a hellaspicy fricken too.

492
00:39:50,166 --> 00:39:51,767
Show them what's real spicy.

493
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:56,700
Doesn't it look tasty?

494
00:40:56,767 --> 00:40:57,767
Yes.

495
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:08,967
Chibap.

496
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,900
Chibap.

497
00:41:18,467 --> 00:41:20,667
- You wanted kimchi, right?
- Yes, please.

498
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:25,266
What's that? There's chicken, egg, rice…

499
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:27,033
It's chicken.

500
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,233
Bulgogi gimbap.

501
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:30,600
In the middle.

502
00:41:30,667 --> 00:41:32,400
Are you guys sharing it?

503
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,867
Would you like a small plate?

504
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,900
- If you want more, just ask.
- Okay.

505
00:41:39,934 --> 00:41:41,767
Perfect. Thank you.

506
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:43,533
This one has sesame oil on it.

507
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,133
The gimbap is good. Try it.

508
00:42:37,467 --> 00:42:39,467
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

509
00:42:39,533 --> 00:42:41,000
The sauce is really good.

510
00:42:41,066 --> 00:42:42,900
Yeah, the sauce is good.

511
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,767
It's so good.

512
00:42:44,867 --> 00:42:45,900
Yes.

513
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:49,300
I've watched lots of videos
of chicken recipes, but…

514
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,567
This is really good.

515
00:43:00,767 --> 00:43:03,066
I should make my chicken like this too.

516
00:43:10,967 --> 00:43:13,367
Can I mix them?

517
00:43:13,433 --> 00:43:15,867
Should I mix it with the egg?

518
00:43:15,934 --> 00:43:17,700
Sure, if you want.

519
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,233
- It's good, right?
- It is.

520
00:43:27,667 --> 00:43:30,967
The rice goes really well with it.

521
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,200
Can I take some?

522
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,033
This one is the best.

523
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:44,600
Wow, that one's really good.

524
00:43:47,967 --> 00:43:49,200
It's delicious.

525
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,800
Mmm!

526
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,467
Try kimchi.

527
00:43:59,834 --> 00:44:02,266
I told you Korean food is really good.

528
00:44:02,367 --> 00:44:03,633
Do you have more kimchi?

529
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:05,100
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

530
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:17,133
Everything's good. Thank you.

531
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:20,700
Is this jicama?

532
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:24,266
What should I eat this with?

533
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:28,900
- Is it radish? It's strong.
- I think it is.

534
00:44:28,934 --> 00:44:30,133
No, it's too strong.

535
00:44:34,433 --> 00:44:35,567
Pickled in vinegar.

536
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,000
In sweet vinegar, I think.

537
00:44:40,166 --> 00:44:41,767
I think it's for the chicken.

538
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:46,166
I feel like they put something like

539
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:47,967
caramelized onion in the chicken.

540
00:44:51,166 --> 00:44:52,033
What's this in here?

541
00:44:54,266 --> 00:44:55,300
Pineapple?

542
00:44:56,367 --> 00:44:57,667
Acitrón?

543
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:03,066
It looks similar, but it's not it.

544
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,867
I think it's a Korean ingredient.

545
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:14,533
It's the same as that pickle but colored.

546
00:45:16,567 --> 00:45:17,834
What leaves are they?

547
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:24,000
Hmm, it's anise.

548
00:45:28,867 --> 00:45:30,200
It tastes like anise.

549
00:45:31,133 --> 00:45:32,367
Anise?

550
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:33,834
Try and guess what it is.

551
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:36,433
What do you think?

552
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,867
I've never tasted any greens like this.

553
00:45:40,967 --> 00:45:42,233
It tastes like anise.

554
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:46,600
I don't know what anise leaves taste like.

555
00:45:46,667 --> 00:45:47,633
Me neither.

556
00:45:50,133 --> 00:45:51,467
Excuse me.

557
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:58,333
Can I ask what the name of this is?

558
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,000
Oh, that's…

559
00:46:01,066 --> 00:46:03,567
It's like a Korean version of cilantro.

560
00:46:03,667 --> 00:46:05,834
Oh, cilantro.

561
00:46:05,934 --> 00:46:07,500
A Korean version of cilantro.

562
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,900
- Seo Jun.
- Yes?

563
00:46:17,967 --> 00:46:18,867
What is it?

564
00:46:24,233 --> 00:46:26,500
I want to have a tater dog too.

565
00:46:27,433 --> 00:46:29,533
I want a tater dog.

566
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:33,767
Back in Seoul, there must be many people
who can make it better than me.

567
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,567
- Hola.
- Hola.

568
00:46:45,667 --> 00:46:47,100
How many?

569
00:46:48,033 --> 00:46:49,400
- Five.
- Five?

570
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:52,333
You should order there.

571
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,800
- Wait. You came before, right?
- Yeah.

572
00:46:54,867 --> 00:46:56,500
- On Wednesday.
- Yeah.

573
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:10,500
Hola.

574
00:47:13,333 --> 00:47:14,834
We got customers?

575
00:47:14,934 --> 00:47:15,967
From the tax office.

576
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:17,900
- Tax office?
- Yes, tax office.

577
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:19,066
Tax office?

578
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,934
Here for a tax investigation?

579
00:47:24,834 --> 00:47:26,600
Which ramyeon do you want?

580
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:28,700
This one has cheese, but not this one.

581
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:31,600
- The one with the cheese.
- All right.

582
00:47:31,667 --> 00:47:35,066
- One ramyeon with cheese.
- With cheese.

583
00:47:35,133 --> 00:47:39,533
One chicken, one gimbap of bulgogi.

584
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:41,066
Oh, make that two please.

585
00:47:41,133 --> 00:47:42,667
One more?

586
00:47:42,734 --> 00:47:44,567
Okay. And spicy pork rice.

587
00:47:44,667 --> 00:47:46,734
One spicy pork rice?

588
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,500
And one of this.

589
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,900
Yes, that's all.

590
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,467
An order.

591
00:47:52,567 --> 00:47:53,567
Okay.

592
00:47:53,867 --> 00:47:55,367
What did we get?

593
00:47:55,467 --> 00:47:57,100
One cheese ramyeon.

594
00:47:57,166 --> 00:47:58,767
One spicy fricken.

595
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,867
One half & half tater dog.

596
00:48:16,166 --> 00:48:18,033
Does anything look interesting?

597
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:26,066
I'd like to have one ramyeon.

598
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:29,700
One ramyeon for you? Okay.

599
00:48:30,033 --> 00:48:32,667
I'll have the ramyeon

600
00:48:32,734 --> 00:48:34,633
with cheese.

601
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:35,533
Okay.

602
00:48:35,767 --> 00:48:39,200
You should order what she ordered.

603
00:48:39,266 --> 00:48:40,300
Gimbap.

604
00:48:41,166 --> 00:48:44,767
There are fried tofu and tuna.
Which one do you like?

605
00:48:44,834 --> 00:48:46,400
Tuna.

606
00:48:46,433 --> 00:48:48,467
- Gimbap de tuna...
- One tuna.

607
00:48:49,066 --> 00:48:52,033
Could you get me
a watermelon juice to drink?

608
00:48:52,133 --> 00:48:53,133
Sure.

609
00:48:53,266 --> 00:48:55,934
- And a watermelon juice?
- Watermelon juice.

610
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:57,834
For me, wine please.

611
00:48:59,700 --> 00:49:00,967
We got an order.

612
00:49:02,567 --> 00:49:04,033
Will you clean your room?

613
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,600
My room?

614
00:49:05,667 --> 00:49:07,533
I'll do it on Saturday.

615
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,100
Now, everyone will find out
how your room is.

616
00:49:10,166 --> 00:49:12,300
Why?

617
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:15,133
Because they all know now how it is.

618
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,567
It's all recorded with the mic here.

619
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:20,133
- You're mean.
- I am.

620
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:27,600
Here's wine for you.

621
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:28,867
Just kidding.

622
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:32,767
Thank you.

623
00:49:33,533 --> 00:49:35,033
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

624
00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:47,500
Let's make a toast. With the Coke too.

625
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,400
Do you think we can order ramyeon to-go?

626
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,633
Maybe we should've ordered
one more gimbap.

627
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:03,834
Do you wanna try other flavors?

628
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:06,667
Tuna or fried tofu?

629
00:50:07,767 --> 00:50:09,500
The 140 pesos one.

630
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:11,100
Can I borrow 20 pesos then?

631
00:50:12,767 --> 00:50:13,767
Thanks.

632
00:50:13,967 --> 00:50:15,300
I love you so much.

633
00:50:15,533 --> 00:50:18,100
I'd like to order one tuna gimbap.

634
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:20,233
- Tuna gimbap?
- Yes.

635
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:21,600
Are you having it here?

636
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:22,934
No, to-go.

637
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,667
- To-go? One tuna gimbap?
- Yes.

638
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:29,734
- Tae Hyung.
- Yes?

639
00:50:29,767 --> 00:50:31,433
We need to make chicken. Quick.

640
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:48,667
What do we do? Spicy pork…

641
00:50:55,066 --> 00:50:57,000
Could you prepare four sauces?

642
00:51:03,367 --> 00:51:05,100
Should I make the spicy pork rice?

643
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,834
- We got a spicy pork rice order?
- Yes.

644
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,266
- Spring onions and onions first.
- Okay.

645
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,400
- And this is the knob.
- Okay. I'll do it.

646
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:22,033
- You saw how much, right?
- Yes.

647
00:51:40,967 --> 00:51:42,433
Oh, this is your step stool?

648
00:51:42,533 --> 00:51:44,934
Yeah, because I'm small.

649
00:51:45,033 --> 00:51:46,867
I need that to use the stove.

650
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,266
You look like a pro now.

651
00:52:55,433 --> 00:52:56,867
- Pardon?
- You're a pro now.

652
00:52:56,934 --> 00:52:58,100
No, I'm not.

653
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:13,800
For the gold table.

654
00:53:14,667 --> 00:53:16,734
Did you try Korean food?
You have, right?

655
00:53:16,834 --> 00:53:17,834
Of course.

656
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,133
You're gonna love it.

657
00:53:20,233 --> 00:53:21,400
I hope so.

658
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:24,567
It's delicious.

659
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,133
Chicken?

660
00:53:29,867 --> 00:53:31,734
Yes, thank you.

661
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:32,834
Tater dog?

662
00:53:35,734 --> 00:53:37,300
It's very big.

663
00:53:37,367 --> 00:53:40,333
Because it's made with potatoes, cheese,

664
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,900
and a lot of things.

665
00:53:41,967 --> 00:53:43,133
It's like elote.

666
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,767
Yeah, it's like elote.

667
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,567
Cheese ramyeon?

668
00:53:48,633 --> 00:53:49,767
The soup you ordered.

669
00:53:53,533 --> 00:53:55,867
Let's start once we get all the food.

670
00:53:55,967 --> 00:54:00,433
Let's all start together.
Like work colleagues.

671
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,967
People here don't start first.

672
00:54:08,033 --> 00:54:10,967
- They wait until everyone gets their food.
- Right?

673
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:34,834
- Spicy pork rice?
- Yes.

674
00:54:37,667 --> 00:54:38,600
Gimbap?

675
00:54:42,567 --> 00:54:43,867
Enjoy.

676
00:54:43,934 --> 00:54:45,300
Enjoy, everyone.

677
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:53,033
- It's good.
- Right?

678
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:54,500
It's not spicy.

679
00:54:58,433 --> 00:55:00,266
It's not spicy. It's good.

680
00:55:01,967 --> 00:55:04,600
I think we ordered the non-spicy one.

681
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:05,834
It's better.

682
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:13,800
Mmm!

683
00:55:14,433 --> 00:55:15,467
Is it good?

684
00:55:16,567 --> 00:55:18,033
- Do you like it?
- Yes, I do.

685
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:19,367
It's less than 200 pesos.

686
00:55:27,233 --> 00:55:30,834
We're so lucky to eat here.

687
00:55:30,934 --> 00:55:32,033
A Korean restaurant.

688
00:55:32,066 --> 00:55:34,633
- Everything here is so pretty.
- In Mexico.

689
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,867
Will our conversation be translated
into Korean?

690
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,266
Yeah, there will be
Korean texts right here.

691
00:55:41,367 --> 00:55:42,367
Here.

692
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,233
When we say something,
the text will show here.

693
00:55:48,633 --> 00:55:50,600
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

694
00:56:17,266 --> 00:56:18,500
Happy face.

695
00:56:33,767 --> 00:56:34,800
Put the trash here.

696
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,433
Taking out the trash. Nice.

697
00:56:48,533 --> 00:56:50,900
You're learning to find what to do.

698
00:56:50,967 --> 00:56:52,834
Getting better and better every day.

699
00:57:11,133 --> 00:57:12,800
Pour it and put the cheese on it.

700
00:57:18,867 --> 00:57:19,734
Wait a sec.

701
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,000
Cheese ramyeon?

702
00:57:36,066 --> 00:57:37,066
That's me.

703
00:57:41,533 --> 00:57:42,633
Thank you.

704
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:46,233
Let's start when we get all the food.

705
00:57:46,333 --> 00:57:48,800
Mom won't wait. She'll start first.

706
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,567
I'm cooling it down.

707
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:53,300
Okay. Dad, you should cool it down too.

708
00:58:11,767 --> 00:58:12,867
Tuna?

709
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,533
Thank you.

710
00:58:16,734 --> 00:58:19,200
- Look. There's a sticker on it.
- That's cute.

711
00:58:25,333 --> 00:58:27,533
I thought it'd be spicy.

712
00:58:27,633 --> 00:58:30,333
- You must've ordered a less spicy one.
- No, I didn't.

713
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:32,800
Maybe they thought you'd be weak.

714
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:35,533
- Excuses me?
- Yes.

715
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:39,600
Do you have chili or some spicy sauce?

716
00:58:39,667 --> 00:58:41,500
Do you want a spicy sauce?

717
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:45,667
- Could you give me some spicy sauce?
- Okay.

718
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:48,200
You're embarrassing me.

719
00:58:48,266 --> 00:58:51,233
In Korea,
they don't put sauces in their food.

720
00:58:53,533 --> 00:58:55,100
Dad is embarrassing her.

721
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,500
They're gonna translate everything we say.

722
00:59:00,867 --> 00:59:02,400
It's very spicy.

723
00:59:03,934 --> 00:59:04,967
Yeah, good.

724
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,000
Just a little. Thank you.

725
00:59:08,934 --> 00:59:10,500
He says it's spicy.

726
00:59:17,734 --> 00:59:18,967
It's not that spicy.

727
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,166
It's spicy but tasty.

728
00:59:30,834 --> 00:59:32,266
Ooh, it's quite spicy now.

729
00:59:35,934 --> 00:59:37,333
Is it spicy now?

730
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,934
The sauce is quite spicy.

731
00:59:41,567 --> 00:59:42,967
Oh, it smells tasty.

732
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,700
It is tasty, but…

733
00:59:46,667 --> 00:59:49,100
Okay. Now, I'm gonna embarrass you guys.

734
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:51,967
By trying to eat it with these chopsticks.

735
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,066
You need to practice it.

736
00:59:55,433 --> 00:59:56,500
It's like this?

737
00:59:57,333 --> 00:59:58,867
Yeah, that doesn't look bad.

738
01:00:01,533 --> 01:00:03,333
I did it! I picked it up!

739
01:00:04,066 --> 01:00:05,233
Oh, no. I dropped it.

740
01:00:30,233 --> 01:00:31,500
Woo Shik, it's for to-go.

741
01:00:40,533 --> 01:00:43,166
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

742
01:02:06,100 --> 01:02:08,000
Hey. Hola.

743
01:02:15,967 --> 01:02:17,100
That's a corn dog.

744
01:02:18,333 --> 01:02:19,867
I wonder how it'd taste.

745
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,700
The corn dog?

746
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,200
- Let's come back for it.
- Okay.

747
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:29,633
- Should we wait?
- Yes.

748
01:02:29,700 --> 01:02:31,333
- Okay.
- About ten minutes.

749
01:02:31,867 --> 01:02:32,867
It's okay.

750
01:02:35,767 --> 01:02:37,200
We can leave notes here.

751
01:02:43,033 --> 01:02:44,834
How do you spell "holiday?"

752
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:48,500
H-o-l-i-d-a-y.

753
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:13,667
You guys came back.

754
01:03:13,734 --> 01:03:15,066
Yeah, we liked the food.

755
01:03:15,133 --> 01:03:16,100
Oh, really?

756
01:03:16,166 --> 01:03:19,400
And the Netherlands are out
of the World Cup,

757
01:03:19,467 --> 01:03:22,100
so we need some comfort food.

758
01:03:26,867 --> 01:03:28,967
Woo Shik, there's no table.

759
01:03:29,066 --> 01:03:29,900
No tables.

760
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,600
No more tables.

761
01:03:31,700 --> 01:03:32,767
No tables.

762
01:03:32,867 --> 01:03:33,967
How many?

763
01:03:34,033 --> 01:03:35,100
Two.

764
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:42,333
Okay...

765
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:46,767
We'll give you a waiting list.

766
01:03:47,066 --> 01:03:49,133
Where should we keep the waiting list?

767
01:03:53,867 --> 01:03:55,100
What should I write here?

768
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:58,867
- What should I write?
- Write the numbers. One, two, three, four…

769
01:04:01,433 --> 01:04:02,600
One, two…

770
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,066
- Thanks, man.
- Thank you.

771
01:04:05,166 --> 01:04:06,467
It was very delicious.

772
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,233
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

773
01:04:08,367 --> 01:04:09,233
Thank you.

774
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,600
Here. You can put your names on the top.

775
01:04:32,233 --> 01:04:33,633
The table's ready.

776
01:04:33,734 --> 01:04:34,934
You know the drill.

777
01:04:35,033 --> 01:04:36,033
Oh, yeah.

778
01:04:37,567 --> 01:04:38,700
Hello.

779
01:04:38,867 --> 01:04:40,800
- Nice to see you again.
- Yes. Thank you.

780
01:04:40,834 --> 01:04:42,367
The food was really good, so…

781
01:04:42,433 --> 01:04:44,400
- Did the Netherlands lose?
- Yes.

782
01:04:44,433 --> 01:04:46,700
At the penalty shootout.

783
01:04:46,767 --> 01:04:48,800
Argentina won the penalty shootout.

784
01:04:48,867 --> 01:04:50,033
Argentina won.

785
01:04:51,600 --> 01:04:53,133
- Sorry.
- Not good.

786
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:54,467
So we need some…

787
01:04:54,533 --> 01:04:56,400
Love. Some Korean love.

788
01:04:56,467 --> 01:04:57,467
All right.

789
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,400
- For me, a ramyeon.
- A regular ramyeon.

790
01:05:01,500 --> 01:05:02,734
You wanted the corn dog.

791
01:05:02,767 --> 01:05:04,834
- Yes, the corn dog.
- One regular?

792
01:05:05,667 --> 01:05:08,133
- That's 180.
- Okay, here you go.

793
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,033
Ramyeon, corn dog.

794
01:05:11,734 --> 01:05:12,767
Ramyeon, corn dog.

795
01:05:14,133 --> 01:05:16,533
Tae Hyung,
get the water ready for ramyeon.

796
01:05:47,333 --> 01:05:48,367
Oh, you came back.

797
01:05:48,433 --> 01:05:49,433
Yes.

798
01:05:53,066 --> 01:05:54,734
Hi. We're closed.

799
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:56,066
Are you here for long?

800
01:05:56,133 --> 01:05:58,200
- Yes.
- Could you come tomorrow then?

801
01:05:58,266 --> 01:05:59,700
Okay, I'll try.

802
01:06:00,800 --> 01:06:04,800
Around five or six tomorrow?

803
01:06:04,867 --> 01:06:05,867
Okay.

804
01:06:06,633 --> 01:06:09,066
We have waiting customers right now.

805
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:10,367
Could you wait a bit?

806
01:06:11,333 --> 01:06:13,100
There's a waiting list over there.

807
01:06:15,233 --> 01:06:16,633
I like your shirt. Nice.

808
01:06:16,734 --> 01:06:20,767
Yeah? We bought it at the market.

809
01:06:20,834 --> 01:06:22,233
Oh, yeah?

810
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:23,967
- Wait, so this is you?
- Yeah.

811
01:06:24,033 --> 01:06:26,200
Okay. Two people, right?

812
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:36,066
Seriously,
I'm going to plan a trip to Korea soon.

813
01:06:37,066 --> 01:06:38,433
Okay. Sounds fun.

814
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:40,867
I wanna see the totally different culture,

815
01:06:40,900 --> 01:06:42,266
and great food there.

816
01:06:42,367 --> 01:06:45,900
They must have
beautiful nature and fantastic cities.

817
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:49,133
They also have an interesting culture.

818
01:06:49,233 --> 01:06:50,433
So many things to do.

819
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:23,600
Which table?

820
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:25,266
Gray.

821
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:29,100
Thank you.

822
01:07:30,834 --> 01:07:32,033
- Are you sharing?
- Yes.

823
01:07:32,066 --> 01:07:34,300
- Always.
- Then I'll get you some plates.

824
01:07:34,367 --> 01:07:35,433
Thanks.

825
01:07:36,233 --> 01:07:38,166
I think it's coated with sugar.

826
01:07:39,367 --> 01:07:40,367
It is sugar.

827
01:07:42,767 --> 01:07:45,767
- Here you go.
- So this is sugar. What are the...

828
01:07:45,834 --> 01:07:48,400
The sauces are mayo, ketchup, and mustard.

829
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:53,200
You wanna try the corn dog first, right?

830
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:54,200
Yes.

831
01:07:55,867 --> 01:07:58,400
It must be, of course, really hot.

832
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,500
All right.

833
01:08:00,533 --> 01:08:02,300
I'm so curious.

834
01:08:08,133 --> 01:08:09,300
Oh, interesting.

835
01:08:13,033 --> 01:08:15,000
It's a very delicious comfort.

836
01:08:21,467 --> 01:08:22,533
It's so different.

837
01:08:24,734 --> 01:08:26,567
Is it like a Berliner?

838
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:29,300
- With a sausage.
- Yeah.

839
01:08:30,433 --> 01:08:31,967
A Berliner with a sausage.

840
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:38,800
Yum.

841
01:08:49,367 --> 01:08:52,233
You guys can sit
on these chairs too, you know.

842
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,166
- We're good!
- Is it okay? Okay.

843
01:08:54,266 --> 01:08:55,800
Leave them for other people.

844
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:57,166
Enjoy.

845
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:01,500
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

846
01:09:05,633 --> 01:09:07,233
The menu is over here.

847
01:09:08,467 --> 01:09:10,233
I've never had Korean food.

848
01:09:10,300 --> 01:09:11,834
- Really?
- Yeah.

849
01:09:15,433 --> 01:09:17,200
It's in different languages.

850
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:18,600
You see English here?

851
01:09:18,667 --> 01:09:19,834
Yes.

852
01:09:23,066 --> 01:09:25,567
I wanna order this. We can share this.

853
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:28,300
- I want the fried tofu gimbap.
- Oh, you too?

854
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:31,767
- I'll take the fried tofu gimbap.
- Me too.

855
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:34,367
You too? So two? Okay.

856
01:09:34,567 --> 01:09:35,834
Anything to drink?

857
01:09:35,934 --> 01:09:38,367
I'll take the watermelon juice.

858
01:09:38,467 --> 01:09:40,533
- Watermelon juice.
- Without ice, please.

859
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:41,700
Without ice.

860
01:09:41,767 --> 01:09:43,066
I don't need any drink.

861
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:50,367
Give this to Yu Mi.
And one watermelon juice without ice.

862
01:09:50,767 --> 01:09:51,767
Two fried tofu.

863
01:09:56,166 --> 01:09:57,333
Without ice.

864
01:10:02,834 --> 01:10:04,033
Here you go.

865
01:10:05,934 --> 01:10:07,967
How long have you been here now?

866
01:10:08,066 --> 01:10:10,300
This is the second week.

867
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,033
It hasn't been long.

868
01:10:12,133 --> 01:10:15,367
I think I've been in Mexico
for three weeks now.

869
01:10:15,433 --> 01:10:17,333
I've been here for a month already.

870
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:22,400
I took the flight on November 7
and arrived on the 8th.

871
01:10:22,567 --> 01:10:24,433
How long are you gonna stay here?

872
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:26,867
I don't know.

873
01:10:26,934 --> 01:10:28,900
I'd like to go from week to week.

874
01:10:28,967 --> 01:10:31,934
Like, "Oh, I'll take another week."

875
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,667
I'm so curious about this place

876
01:10:33,767 --> 01:10:37,667
because a friend of mine lived in Mexico
and traveled a lot here.

877
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:39,867
So you also plan to stay here long-term.

878
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:41,734
Yeah.

879
01:10:41,834 --> 01:10:42,700
Me too.

880
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:45,333
- And you stayed in Tulum for two weeks.
- Yes.

881
01:11:54,066 --> 01:11:55,967
What did you do in Tulum?

882
01:11:56,033 --> 01:12:01,533
After arriving, I looked for yummy places.

883
01:12:11,066 --> 01:12:13,734
Two gimbap at once.

884
01:12:13,834 --> 01:12:15,500
Even if it doesn't work, it's fine.

885
01:12:16,333 --> 01:12:17,633
I can just start over.

886
01:12:26,800 --> 01:12:28,700
I actually

887
01:12:28,767 --> 01:12:30,633
love gimbap very much.

888
01:12:32,667 --> 01:12:34,467
Well, I used to.

889
01:12:40,633 --> 01:12:42,333
I hope it tastes good.

890
01:12:52,200 --> 01:12:53,900
I rolled the two at once.

891
01:12:54,934 --> 01:12:56,100
That's amazing.

892
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:02,567
Go now.

893
01:13:05,233 --> 01:13:06,200
Gimbap?

894
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:08,033
Thank you.

895
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:09,200
Thank you.

896
01:13:12,834 --> 01:13:14,800
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

897
01:13:39,233 --> 01:13:41,100
So this is authentic…

898
01:13:42,266 --> 01:13:44,166
- Korean cuisine.
- Mm-hmm.

899
01:13:44,233 --> 01:13:46,867
Not cooked by Mexicans.

900
01:13:51,467 --> 01:13:52,633
It's really good.

901
01:13:55,867 --> 01:13:57,066
The sauce is good.

902
01:14:04,867 --> 01:14:06,100
This one is quite spicy.

903
01:14:07,633 --> 01:14:09,000
It has lots of veggies.

904
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:11,934
Yes, lots of veggies.

905
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:21,066
Let's order the chicken. I want this one.

906
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:28,734
One spicy fricken
and one hellaspicy fricken, please.

907
01:14:28,834 --> 01:14:30,700
One spicy one too? Okay.

908
01:14:33,967 --> 01:14:35,934
Excuse me.

909
01:14:36,033 --> 01:14:37,500
We have no table.

910
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:38,700
It's to-go.

911
01:14:38,800 --> 01:14:40,100
Okay. Just a minute.

912
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,433
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

913
01:14:42,500 --> 01:14:44,266
Hello. Welcome back.

914
01:14:55,567 --> 01:14:57,367
I love the corn dog.

915
01:14:59,066 --> 01:15:00,700
Corn dog coated with sugar.

916
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,333
This one. The basic one with...

917
01:15:04,033 --> 01:15:06,600
Can I be back for it in five minutes?

918
01:15:06,700 --> 01:15:09,200
Sure. You can take
ten minutes even, or more.

919
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,200
- Oh, that's perfect.
- Take your time.

920
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:13,367
- Thank you.
- It'll be ready.

921
01:15:13,734 --> 01:15:15,900
- Hello.
- Can I ask for chicken?

922
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:17,066
Spicy fricken.

923
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,533
- One spicy fricken?
- Yes.

924
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:21,200
An order!

925
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:22,934
An order.

926
01:15:23,433 --> 01:15:24,633
We got an order.

927
01:15:28,433 --> 01:15:30,333
- Huh? Tae Hyung.
- Yes?

928
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:33,867
- Spicy fricken and hellaspicy fricken.
- Okay.

929
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:44,633
That's too little. Add some more.

930
01:15:44,734 --> 01:15:46,734
- Seo Jun, they're 14 pieces.
- Tae Hyung.

931
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,467
But we have two servings to make.

932
01:15:48,533 --> 01:15:50,467
So I'm taking one more serving now.

933
01:15:51,633 --> 01:15:53,166
Oh, that's one serving?

934
01:15:53,233 --> 01:15:54,700
Yes, the order just got in.

935
01:15:54,767 --> 01:15:56,433
Oh, sorry.

936
01:15:56,500 --> 01:15:58,567
- Seo Jun.
- Sorry.

937
01:15:58,633 --> 01:16:00,834
- Calm down.
- Sorry.

938
01:16:01,233 --> 01:16:03,867
- No excuse even if you're the chef.
- Sorry.

939
01:16:37,667 --> 01:16:38,800
I’ll give them a lot.

940
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:46,433
This is hellaspicy fricken.

941
01:16:47,467 --> 01:16:49,567
- Thank you.
- And the spicy fricken.

942
01:16:51,633 --> 01:16:53,834
It's the same
as the one we ordered before.

943
01:16:53,867 --> 01:16:56,467
This is the sweet one
and this is the spicy one.

944
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:05,433
Ooh, that's spicy.

945
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,867
Is it very spicy?

946
01:17:06,934 --> 01:17:07,800
No.

947
01:17:14,734 --> 01:17:17,266
- It's quite spicy.
- Really?

948
01:17:17,367 --> 01:17:18,300
Is it very spicy?

949
01:17:28,200 --> 01:17:29,400
Mm-hmm.

950
01:17:29,467 --> 01:17:32,033
It's spicy for him.

951
01:17:36,367 --> 01:17:37,367
Spicy?

952
01:17:40,100 --> 01:17:41,567
It's spicy, but not so…

953
01:17:41,633 --> 01:17:43,600
Whoa, hold on.

954
01:17:43,667 --> 01:17:44,567
It's so spicy.

955
01:17:44,633 --> 01:17:45,800
I told you it's spicy.

956
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:48,500
It's good spicy though.

957
01:17:51,066 --> 01:17:53,233
- For the purple table.
- Purple.

958
01:17:59,033 --> 01:18:00,333
Mmm!

959
01:18:01,033 --> 01:18:02,233
Is it good?

960
01:18:02,300 --> 01:18:04,200
Yeah, very good.

961
01:18:04,266 --> 01:18:05,233
The chicken's good?

962
01:18:05,233 --> 01:18:06,166
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

963
01:18:23,867 --> 01:18:26,300
Is it good? Is it?

964
01:18:26,400 --> 01:18:28,100
This is really good.

965
01:18:28,533 --> 01:18:31,333
- Try it.
- It's not spicy at all.

966
01:18:31,433 --> 01:18:33,800
Close your eyes
and feel the flavor explode.

967
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:38,333
Isn't it good?

968
01:18:55,467 --> 01:18:58,433
- It's so big.
- Why'd you bring a big one?

969
01:18:58,533 --> 01:18:59,967
Jeez.

970
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,834
The corn dog is filling.

971
01:19:20,567 --> 01:19:23,400
This food is exactly what we needed.

972
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,333
That was delicious.

973
01:19:32,433 --> 01:19:33,633
Let's go.

974
01:19:35,300 --> 01:19:37,667
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

975
01:19:38,333 --> 01:19:40,300
- Bye-bye.
- Thank you.

976
01:19:43,066 --> 01:19:45,166
The dog is lying here.
It doesn't care.

977
01:19:46,100 --> 01:19:47,533
Is it alive?

978
01:19:50,233 --> 01:19:51,667
Are you alive?

979
01:20:02,867 --> 01:20:04,033
I like their shirts.

980
01:20:04,133 --> 01:20:05,533
It looks quite nice.

981
01:20:06,033 --> 01:20:07,233
It looks comfortable.

982
01:20:07,767 --> 01:20:11,567
I like it
that they're all in similar shirts.

983
01:20:12,300 --> 01:20:13,500
Funky vibes.

984
01:20:19,433 --> 01:20:21,800
Tae Hyung, do you want a tater dog?

985
01:20:21,834 --> 01:20:22,600
What?

986
01:20:22,633 --> 01:20:24,233
Do you want a tater dog?

987
01:20:24,266 --> 01:20:26,100
- That'd be lovely.
- Okay.

988
01:20:26,166 --> 01:20:27,400
- Seo Jun.
- Yes?

989
01:20:27,467 --> 01:20:29,066
- I love you.
- I love you too.

990
01:20:49,700 --> 01:20:50,633
Here. It's for you.

991
01:20:50,700 --> 01:20:52,166
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

992
01:20:55,967 --> 01:20:57,600
Hey, your tater dog is here.

993
01:20:57,633 --> 01:21:01,066
Yay! Thank you.

994
01:21:01,133 --> 01:21:02,233
Nice.

995
01:21:16,133 --> 01:21:17,133
How is it?

996
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:20,834
It's really good.

997
01:21:23,567 --> 01:21:25,467
Maybe I should try one too.

998
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:29,900
Hey, would you like one too?

999
01:21:29,967 --> 01:21:31,166
Yes.

1000
01:21:31,233 --> 01:21:33,266
- A tater dog?
- A regular corn dog.

1001
01:21:33,967 --> 01:21:35,266
It looks so good.

1002
01:21:42,667 --> 01:21:43,600
It's hot, isn't it?

1003
01:21:47,967 --> 01:21:49,900
Excuse me, would you like to try this?

1004
01:21:50,066 --> 01:21:51,300
Thank you.

1005
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:53,467
It's sticky rice with honey.

1006
01:21:53,567 --> 01:21:55,667
Oh, beautiful. Thank you.

1007
01:21:55,734 --> 01:21:59,467
For this, I'll use these fancy things.

1008
01:21:59,533 --> 01:22:02,467
I've never used metal chopsticks.

1009
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,300
It's really sticky.

1010
01:22:06,367 --> 01:22:07,834
Sticky rice, sticky honey.

1011
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,166
It's so fine.

1012
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,233
I like it when people make things so fine.

1013
01:22:13,300 --> 01:22:15,166
It's so tiny and cute.

1014
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:16,533
It's a cookie.

1015
01:22:16,633 --> 01:22:17,834
A piece of cookie.

1016
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:19,667
Wow.

1017
01:22:20,100 --> 01:22:22,100
New things always make me happy.

1018
01:22:23,300 --> 01:22:26,066
Gomap… Gobmapseupnida.

1019
01:22:26,166 --> 01:22:28,066
Wait. Let's hear it.

1020
01:22:28,967 --> 01:22:30,834
Gomapseupnida.

1021
01:22:30,900 --> 01:22:33,066
- Gomapseupnida.
- Gomapseupnida.

1022
01:22:33,133 --> 01:22:34,533
Gomapseupnida.

1023
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:41,867
Gracias.

1024
01:22:41,934 --> 01:22:42,800
Gracias.

1025
01:22:42,867 --> 01:22:44,900
- Gomapseupnida.
- Gomapseupnida.

1026
01:22:44,967 --> 01:22:46,467
Thank you.

1027
01:22:46,667 --> 01:22:48,867
Thank you.

1028
01:22:53,133 --> 01:22:54,767
Are you guys a family?

1029
01:22:54,867 --> 01:22:58,066
No, we're not. We're actors from Korea.

1030
01:22:58,166 --> 01:22:59,700
Oh, really?

1031
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:02,734
- Have you the Korean movie, "Parasite?"
- Yes.

1032
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,700
He's on "Parasite."

1033
01:23:04,767 --> 01:23:05,967
Okay.

1034
01:23:08,967 --> 01:23:10,467
That's so funny.

1035
01:23:10,533 --> 01:23:12,600
I thought it was a real restaurant.

1036
01:23:18,533 --> 01:23:22,333
And I was like, "They must be a family.
They're wearing cool shirts."

1037
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:26,367
What is it?

1038
01:23:26,467 --> 01:23:28,367
No, you have it.

1039
01:23:28,467 --> 01:23:30,166
- You don't want it?
- No, I'm good.

1040
01:23:31,467 --> 01:23:33,467
- It's good.
- Stop.

1041
01:23:35,300 --> 01:23:36,567
You never had it, right?

1042
01:23:43,800 --> 01:23:45,433
It's too sweet. The sugar.

1043
01:23:47,133 --> 01:23:48,166
It gives you energy.

1044
01:23:48,767 --> 01:23:50,000
We're almost done.

1045
01:23:53,834 --> 01:23:54,667
They all left.

1046
01:23:54,767 --> 01:23:56,667
- I think it's almost time to close.
- Yeah?

1047
01:23:56,767 --> 01:24:00,266
People always stop coming at this hour.
Interesting.

1048
01:24:00,367 --> 01:24:03,000
Like magic

1049
01:24:32,033 --> 01:24:33,233
Hola.

1050
01:24:33,533 --> 01:24:35,734
- The most famous menu?
- The famous one?

1051
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:37,266
These are today's specials.

1052
01:24:37,367 --> 01:24:41,333
And these are our signature menus.

1053
01:24:41,400 --> 01:24:44,000
And people love the chicken.

1054
01:24:44,066 --> 01:24:46,700
I wanna try this.

1055
01:24:46,767 --> 01:24:49,633
- Is it spicy?
- A little bit.

1056
01:24:49,700 --> 01:24:52,934
It's not too spicy. Just a little bit.

1057
01:24:53,000 --> 01:24:55,333
You want the spicy pork rice?

1058
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,867
I order this. It has this thing called

1059
01:24:57,934 --> 01:25:01,266
gochujang. It's a little spicy.

1060
01:25:01,367 --> 01:25:03,367
I don't want spicy. It hurts my stomach.

1061
01:25:03,467 --> 01:25:06,100
This one has beef inside. It's not spicy.

1062
01:25:06,900 --> 01:25:08,433
- Not spicy.
- I'll get that one.

1063
01:25:08,533 --> 01:25:10,000
- One? Okay.
- Yes.

1064
01:25:10,567 --> 01:25:12,433
Please take this to your table.

1065
01:25:13,300 --> 01:25:16,166
I wanna try the one you ordered too.

1066
01:25:16,233 --> 01:25:18,700
- Do you want some?
- Yes, please.

1067
01:25:23,233 --> 01:25:25,133
- Wine?
- Yes.

1068
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,333
Thanks.

1069
01:25:30,333 --> 01:25:32,266
It tastes good.

1070
01:25:32,333 --> 01:25:33,700
It's tasty.

1071
01:25:33,767 --> 01:25:36,200
This is exactly what I needed.

1072
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:37,900
This one's good too.

1073
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:39,367
- Is it freshly squeezed?
- Yes.

1074
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,500
No.

1075
01:25:45,100 --> 01:25:47,300
- Maria.
- It's really good.

1076
01:25:47,367 --> 01:25:49,767
It's hard to make
good pineapple juice like this.

1077
01:25:49,834 --> 01:25:52,300
- Yu Mi. Gimbap and a rice menu.
- Okay.

1078
01:25:53,333 --> 01:25:54,934
- Gimbap and a rice menu?
- Yes.

1079
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,700
- I can help you with the rice.
- I'll tell you the recipe then.

1080
01:26:01,900 --> 01:26:04,033
- Okay. You make your gimbap first.
- Okay.

1081
01:26:04,066 --> 01:26:05,500
Spring onion, onion, carrot, meat.

1082
01:26:25,066 --> 01:26:27,700
- You don't add any sauce here.
- No.

1083
01:26:27,767 --> 01:26:29,033
Maybe we can try.

1084
01:26:29,100 --> 01:26:30,433
Let's try adding a little.

1085
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:40,934
Do we put lettuce in bulgogi rice?

1086
01:26:40,967 --> 01:26:41,967
No, perilla leaves.

1087
01:26:42,066 --> 01:26:43,934
- I got them here.
- Perilla leaves?

1088
01:26:43,934 --> 01:26:44,767
Yes.

1089
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:46,467
Add sesame seeds too.

1090
01:26:46,567 --> 01:26:47,467
Okay.

1091
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:05,467
I made bulgogi rice. Check it out.

1092
01:27:05,667 --> 01:27:07,367
- It looks nice.
- To the camera too.

1093
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:20,400
Thank you.

1094
01:27:21,266 --> 01:27:22,633
Can we wash our hands?

1095
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:24,800
- Inside the hotel.
- Oh, thank you.

1096
01:27:24,934 --> 01:27:26,800
Go ahead. I'll be waiting.

1097
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:34,533
Here you go.

1098
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:35,800
Thank you.

1099
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:56,467
She's taking a while.

1100
01:28:10,166 --> 01:28:11,166
I wanted to eat.

1101
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:13,367
You took too long.

1102
01:28:13,433 --> 01:28:14,900
How could you!

1103
01:28:22,934 --> 01:28:23,800
What is this?

1104
01:28:29,333 --> 01:28:30,767
Mmm!

1105
01:28:30,867 --> 01:28:32,767
- I like that better though.
- This?

1106
01:28:34,467 --> 01:28:35,967
It's delicious.

1107
01:28:36,066 --> 01:28:36,934
I like it.

1108
01:28:40,734 --> 01:28:42,000
It's delicious.

1109
01:28:44,967 --> 01:28:47,767
Is it beef or pork?

1110
01:28:47,834 --> 01:28:49,200
Beef.

1111
01:28:49,266 --> 01:28:51,066
It's very good.

1112
01:28:53,834 --> 01:28:54,934
Oh, no. I broke it.

1113
01:28:55,033 --> 01:28:56,467
Aww, how embarrassing.

1114
01:28:56,567 --> 01:28:57,867
If I grab it, it'll fall.

1115
01:28:57,967 --> 01:28:59,967
It's just one bite.

1116
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:02,500
Auntie, I can't do this.

1117
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,800
Use the fork, you silly.

1118
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:06,767
I can do it.

1119
01:29:06,867 --> 01:29:08,066
No, I can't.

1120
01:29:10,967 --> 01:29:13,200
It's because you haven't practiced.

1121
01:29:13,266 --> 01:29:14,834
Oh, well.

1122
01:29:16,934 --> 01:29:19,734
- What am I gonna do with you?
- I can't.

1123
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:20,767
I did it.

1124
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:27,233
Like I said before,
you get stressed too easily.

1125
01:29:27,300 --> 01:29:28,767
I'm a Chihuahua.

1126
01:29:29,934 --> 01:29:32,467
You're a Chihuahua? Oh, come on.

1127
01:29:32,567 --> 01:29:35,033
More like a Great Dane.

1128
01:29:40,333 --> 01:29:43,633
You know what? That food was just perfect.

1129
01:29:43,700 --> 01:29:45,100
Yes, it was.

1130
01:29:45,166 --> 01:29:47,600
- Let's go before--
- Not until I finish my wine.

1131
01:29:47,667 --> 01:29:49,100
I can't have it so quickly.

1132
01:29:49,166 --> 01:29:50,800
I can sing you a drinking song.

1133
01:29:50,867 --> 01:29:53,133
Excuse me,
but wine is supposed to be savored.

1134
01:30:01,166 --> 01:30:02,367
I think we're done now.

1135
01:30:02,467 --> 01:30:04,700
- No one's coming now, right?
- I think so.

1136
01:30:12,066 --> 01:30:13,000
Come tomorrow?

1137
01:30:15,166 --> 01:30:16,600
When should I come back?

1138
01:30:17,266 --> 01:30:19,667
At 2 PM. Tomorrow is our last day.

1139
01:30:24,533 --> 01:30:26,633
Oh, boy.

1140
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:28,266
Did we hit 10,000 again?

1141
01:30:28,333 --> 01:30:29,467
No.

1142
01:30:29,533 --> 01:30:32,333
Doing only the dinner service,
it's hard to hit 10,000.

1143
01:30:40,066 --> 01:30:41,400
- Doing the math?
- Yes.

1144
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:42,767
We made over 7,000 pesos.

1145
01:30:42,867 --> 01:30:44,066
Whoa, really?

1146
01:30:46,300 --> 01:30:48,800
Had we done the lunch,
we would've hit 10,000.

1147
01:30:48,867 --> 01:30:52,333
If we had made 5,000 from lunch,
it would've been 12,000.

1148
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:53,500
- Wait, Seo Jin.
- Yes?

1149
01:30:53,567 --> 01:30:56,000
Have you been counting it all along?

1150
01:30:57,300 --> 01:30:58,300
How did you know?

1151
01:30:58,367 --> 01:30:59,500
I balanced it earlier.

1152
01:30:59,567 --> 01:31:01,333
- What?
- I did it earlier.

1153
01:31:31,100 --> 01:31:32,467
How much did we make today?

1154
01:31:32,533 --> 01:31:33,734
About 7,500 pesos.

1155
01:31:34,433 --> 01:31:35,400
Not bad.

1156
01:31:35,467 --> 01:31:38,300
- If we'd been open for lunch…
- I mean, then--

1157
01:31:38,367 --> 01:31:40,967
Tomorrow, we must set our highest record.

1158
01:31:41,066 --> 01:31:43,633
Then we'll need a break.

1159
01:31:43,734 --> 01:31:45,667
No break tomorrow. It's our last day.

1160
01:31:45,767 --> 01:31:47,033
What time do we start?

1161
01:31:48,300 --> 01:31:50,033
I was thinking we could open early.

1162
01:31:50,133 --> 01:31:51,266
- What time?
- About 1 PM.

1163
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:54,533
What about the ingredients?

1164
01:31:54,600 --> 01:31:56,867
We must prep like crazy tomorrow.

1165
01:31:56,900 --> 01:31:59,133
Come three hours in advance
and work crazy.

1166
01:31:59,166 --> 01:32:00,834
We'll work like crazy tomorrow.

1167
01:32:00,900 --> 01:32:01,934
Tomorrow…

1168
01:32:02,934 --> 01:32:04,266
We're opening at 2 PM.

1169
01:32:05,834 --> 01:32:06,767
Okay?

1170
01:32:07,333 --> 01:32:09,900
Tomorrow, buy all the chicken.

1171
01:32:10,934 --> 01:32:11,867
Let's open at 2:30 PM tomorrow.

1172
01:32:11,934 --> 01:32:14,233
No, we're opening at 2 PM.

1173
01:32:18,133 --> 01:32:19,333
What?

1174
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:22,100
What is it?

1175
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:23,567
Attention, everyone.

1176
01:32:23,667 --> 01:32:26,033
The boss has something to say.

1177
01:32:26,900 --> 01:32:28,500
Well, it's just that

1178
01:32:28,567 --> 01:32:30,834
we're opening at 2 PM tomorrow.

1179
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:32,500
So prep lots of ingredients

1180
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:35,200
because we'll be busy tomorrow.

1181
01:32:35,266 --> 01:32:37,800
These two will leave home at 11 AM

1182
01:32:37,867 --> 01:32:39,600
and buy all the chicken available.

1183
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:40,800
He said 11 AM.

1184
01:32:49,500 --> 01:32:50,734
Let's go.

1185
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,367
The plates?

1186
01:32:56,467 --> 01:32:57,967
No, the dessert.

1187
01:32:58,066 --> 01:33:00,633
- Oh, do you want this?
- You have it.

1188
01:33:00,700 --> 01:33:02,700
SCORE!

1189
01:33:02,767 --> 01:33:04,867
- Thanks. You're so kind.
- Gracias.

1190
01:33:09,433 --> 01:33:10,333
Thank you.

1191
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,233
You're so kind.

1192
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:16,967
Guess how much we made.

1193
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:19,066
- How much?
- We hit 7,000 pesos.

1194
01:33:21,166 --> 01:33:22,400
We hit 7,000?

1195
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:23,667
We made about 7,500.

1196
01:33:25,266 --> 01:33:27,667
There's something else I learned.

1197
01:33:27,767 --> 01:33:29,734
Whenever the boss takes orders,

1198
01:33:29,834 --> 01:33:32,100
he adds the numbers up in his head.

1199
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:38,500
I was going to use the calculator,
but he already knew the number.

1200
01:33:41,266 --> 01:33:42,367
So this is really

1201
01:33:42,433 --> 01:33:43,667
all about money to him.

1202
01:33:43,734 --> 01:33:45,300
It is indeed.

1203
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:50,300
Is it our tip?

1204
01:33:51,033 --> 01:33:52,367
Someone even left 100 bucks.

1205
01:34:00,934 --> 01:34:02,100
Your first tip.

1206
01:34:02,200 --> 01:34:04,133
- Fifty pesos.
- Good for you.

1207
01:34:04,233 --> 01:34:05,667
Tip jar.

1208
01:34:05,767 --> 01:34:07,000
Ninety pesos.

1209
01:34:14,867 --> 01:34:16,433
That's a lot of tip.

1210
01:34:20,633 --> 01:34:22,400
Seo Jin, this is all mine, right?

1211
01:34:22,467 --> 01:34:23,567
- Of course.
- Tae Hyung.

1212
01:34:23,633 --> 01:34:24,834
See how much you got.

1213
01:34:33,467 --> 01:34:35,700
- Wait. There's a 200-peso bill?
- Yes.

1214
01:34:35,800 --> 01:34:37,633
- A 500-peso bill?
- Yes. 200 and 500.

1215
01:34:37,734 --> 01:34:39,700
How could 500 pesos be a tip?

1216
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:41,567
- That can't be tip.
- Seriously.

1217
01:34:41,633 --> 01:34:43,600
- I--
- Did you steal it?

1218
01:34:43,667 --> 01:34:45,066
- No.
- Did you?

1219
01:34:45,133 --> 01:34:46,000
No, I didn't.

1220
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:49,600
You opened the cash drawer, didn't you?

1221
01:34:49,667 --> 01:34:50,600
- No.
- You didn't?

1222
01:34:50,667 --> 01:34:52,734
- I didn't.
- Who pays 500 as a tip?

1223
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:55,367
How could you not trust me?

1224
01:34:55,400 --> 01:34:57,033
That's too many 500-peso bills.

1225
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:59,166
Does it hurt? It hurts me too.

1226
01:35:00,834 --> 01:35:02,233
You opened the cash drawer.

1227
01:35:02,333 --> 01:35:03,467
It hurts.

1228
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,200
You don't trust me.

1229
01:35:06,300 --> 01:35:09,166
- This hurts.
- Gosh. Hey.

1230
01:35:09,266 --> 01:35:11,900
Seriously, I didn't steal it.

1231
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,000
How do you have
two 500-peso bills then?

1232
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,266
I swear I didn't steal it.

1233
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:20,433
He was going to take it secretly tomorrow,

1234
01:35:20,500 --> 01:35:21,800
and he's caught.

1235
01:35:28,233 --> 01:35:30,533
We'll close as soon as we hit 12,000.

1236
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:33,700
Let's go for 12,000 pesos!

1237
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:37,333
I wonder what's going to happen today.

1238
01:35:37,433 --> 01:35:38,800
Today doesn't seem bad.

1239
01:35:38,900 --> 01:35:40,266
That sounds so scary.

1240
01:35:40,734 --> 01:35:42,600
- Let's speed up, guys.
- Move, move.

1241
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:44,166
I'm getting better at this.

1242
01:35:44,266 --> 01:35:47,066
This show helped me
discover my hidden gift.

1243
01:35:47,166 --> 01:35:48,467
Fry more chicken?

1244
01:35:49,934 --> 01:35:53,734
This never happened before.

1245
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,900
- Why do we have no customers?
- I know.

1246
01:35:56,333 --> 01:35:58,166
Are you sure we're open?

1247
01:35:58,233 --> 01:36:00,567
It's quite slow today.

1248
01:36:00,633 --> 01:36:03,200
Did you chant,
"Let's go for 12,000 pesos?"

1249
01:36:03,233 --> 01:36:04,867
Yes, I probably said it loudest.

1250
01:36:05,233 --> 01:36:07,233
We prepped the most ingredients ever

1251
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:10,433
What if we end up selling nothing today?

1252
01:36:10,533 --> 01:36:12,433
Sir, I'd like to have one ramyeon.

1253
01:36:12,533 --> 01:36:14,533
- Get back to the kitchen, now.
- Huh?

1254
01:36:14,633 --> 01:36:16,667
But there are no customers.

1255
01:36:17,033 --> 01:36:19,033
Go Tae Hyung, go Tae Hyung

1256
01:36:19,834 --> 01:36:22,266
This is hilarious.
It's like a dance party.

1257
01:36:22,333 --> 01:36:23,967
I want to become a singer!

1258
01:36:24,367 --> 01:36:26,767
It'll certainly attract customers.

1259
01:36:26,800 --> 01:36:27,734
It'll be a jackpot.

1260
01:36:30,734 --> 01:36:33,533
This is far from what I expected.
This is too much.

1261
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:34,600
Unbelievable.

1262
01:36:35,133 --> 01:36:36,900
We got a customer.

1263
01:36:36,967 --> 01:36:38,734
Let's spread the food smell.

1264
01:36:38,767 --> 01:36:39,667
Okay.

1265
01:36:39,734 --> 01:36:41,967
It's only attracting this dog.

1266
01:36:42,567 --> 01:36:45,934
- You're so excited.
- You like it, huh?

1267
01:36:46,033 --> 01:36:47,266
Can we eat here?

1268
01:36:47,367 --> 01:36:48,734
Is it opening at 3 PM?

1269
01:36:48,834 --> 01:36:50,767
People suddenly started rushing in.

1270
01:36:50,867 --> 01:36:51,767
Two.

1271
01:36:57,400 --> 01:37:00,266
Sorry. Which table was it?
