1
00:00:22,567 --> 00:00:26,200
JINNY'S KITCHEN

2
00:00:26,266 --> 00:00:29,066
It's a place called Bacalar in Mexico.

3
00:00:29,133 --> 00:00:31,166
We'll be heading into a small town

4
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:32,500
and open a restaurant.

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,166
Open!

6
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:40,834
We need to go get customers.

7
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,934
Gosh, the rain...

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,100
Seo Jin.

9
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:45,767
No one's coming.

10
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,533
Goodness, gracious...

11
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,200
-Hello.
-Hello.

12
00:00:55,934 --> 00:00:57,967
I think they're coming.

13
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,367
-Hello.
-Hello.

14
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:03,900
I think they'll come in.

15
00:01:05,133 --> 00:01:07,300
-I'll go.
-The chairs. Push the chairs in.

16
00:01:10,834 --> 00:01:13,033
All right. Let's go.

17
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:20,467
They're coming.

18
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:23,900
See?

19
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,734
I said we should wait and see.

20
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:31,433
-You can order here.
-Oh, there.

21
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,000
And sit anywhere you like.

22
00:01:36,867 --> 00:01:38,433
What do you recommend?

23
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:43,567
What kind of food do you like?

24
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,433
Do you like meat?

25
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,233
Yeah, I like meat. I also like rice.

26
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:48,400
He was looking for rice.

27
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:50,767
Then I definitely recommend
bulgogi gimbap.

28
00:01:50,834 --> 00:01:51,734
Bulgogi gimbap?

29
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,266
Yes. It's rice wrapped
with laver and bulgogi.

30
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:56,400
Okay.

31
00:01:56,467 --> 00:01:58,467
Let's have one of that.

32
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:00,300
Can I get...

33
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:01,533
Do you want to try this?

34
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:03,266
Yes, let's try that one too.

35
00:02:03,333 --> 00:02:05,967
Can we get one original corn dog?

36
00:02:06,033 --> 00:02:08,133
And a tteokbokki.

37
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,233
I think that's enough.

38
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:12,667
Anything to drink?

39
00:02:12,734 --> 00:02:14,266
UHM…

40
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:15,934
Is this all you have?

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,800
Yes.

42
00:02:20,967 --> 00:02:25,633
-Can I get one mineral water?
-I'll get a Sprite.

43
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:36,767
-Soju?
-No soju?

44
00:02:36,834 --> 00:02:39,266
-Oh, sorry.
-It's okay.

45
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:40,700
No alcohol.

46
00:02:43,767 --> 00:02:45,266
They want soju.

47
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,533
Soju?

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,033
We said we didn't have it.

49
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:51,166
Wine?

50
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:53,734
Wine with tteokbokki?

51
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:57,033
Seo Jun.

52
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,600
-Do they want alcohol?
-Yes.

53
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:01,233
We have wine.

54
00:03:02,934 --> 00:03:04,400
They like Korea.

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,467
Hello, this is our first day,

56
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:13,100
so if you like, we can give you some wine.

57
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,700
-Of course.
-Sure.

58
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:16,066
Red or white?

59
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:18,033
-White?
-Yes.

60
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,533
Which one goes better with bulgogi?

61
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:28,400
I'm not sure, but maybe red?

62
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:30,767
I'll have red then. Thank you.

63
00:03:30,834 --> 00:03:31,934
You're welcome.

64
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,633
This must be their dinner, so…

65
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,100
They wouldn't mind
having a little extra, right?

66
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,100
Bulgogi.

67
00:04:07,133 --> 00:04:08,133
It has to look nice.

68
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,066
-Perilla leaves?
-Make it look nice.

69
00:04:12,266 --> 00:04:13,266
Four leaves.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,633
It smells good.

71
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,633
It smells really good.

72
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,433
I love this smell.

73
00:04:33,533 --> 00:04:36,066
The other guy over there is a singer.

74
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,734
Yeah? Do you recognize him?

75
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,200
He was in some group.

76
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:49,033
It looks totally different
from what we had.

77
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,633
It looks new.

78
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,934
It looks very different.

79
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,233
Is this yours? Tteokbokki?

80
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,233
Yes, thank you.

81
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,166
You can use these

82
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,734
to cut it.

83
00:05:30,934 --> 00:05:33,166
-Okay. Thank you.
-Okay?

84
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:35,867
That's interesting.

85
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:38,166
The knife…
I mean the scissors are really good.

86
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,767
And it's fun.

87
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,834
Is this for you?

88
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,433
Or hers? For you?

89
00:05:49,533 --> 00:05:51,500
No, we'll share it. It's fine.

90
00:05:53,967 --> 00:05:56,800
I'm gonna post this on my Instagram.

91
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,000
Vino tinto, vino blanco?

92
00:06:15,767 --> 00:06:17,700
They are big glasses.

93
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:24,100
-It's our compliment.
-Yes. Thank you.

94
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:33,233
Let's eat now.

95
00:06:39,433 --> 00:06:42,900
-Put it right here?
-Yes, thank you.

96
00:06:45,066 --> 00:06:46,333
Do you want another photo?

97
00:06:54,734 --> 00:06:56,500
Yea? It's good?

98
00:07:06,734 --> 00:07:08,133
It's tasty.

99
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:10,567
Especially this one.

100
00:07:30,633 --> 00:07:33,900
It's literally sweet and savory.

101
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:35,000
It's really good.

102
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,467
-It's good.
-Yeah?

103
00:07:58,066 --> 00:07:59,800
That one's good too, right?

104
00:07:59,867 --> 00:08:00,934
Yes.

105
00:08:02,433 --> 00:08:04,600
Cheers to the delicious food.

106
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:05,767
Cheers.

107
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:15,633
It's good.

108
00:08:22,066 --> 00:08:24,700
Tae Hyung, go check if they like the food.

109
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,700
Is everything all right?

110
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:34,233
-They speak English.
-Sorry?

111
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,567
I don't speak Spanish.

112
00:08:36,633 --> 00:08:38,600
Sorry.

113
00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:40,734
But we understood what you said.

114
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,533
And everything's good. Thanks.

115
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,700
Where are you from?

116
00:08:45,767 --> 00:08:48,100
-Amsterdam.
-Amsterdam.

117
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,800
So far from home.

118
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,467
Hello.

119
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:14,367
Just me.

120
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:15,300
Just you?

121
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:18,500
You can order here
and sit anywhere you like.

122
00:09:21,033 --> 00:09:23,333
-This one.
-Okay.

123
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,133
Is that all?

124
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,100
A cold water too.

125
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,967
Sparkling or still water?

126
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,066
-Regular water, please.
-Regular it is.

127
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,467
Are you a TV star in Korea?

128
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:38,700
Actually, I'm an actor.

129
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:39,900
In Korea...

130
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:44,166
You have a wonderful voice and diction.

131
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:45,333
Thank you.

132
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:46,900
Here you go.

133
00:09:59,233 --> 00:10:00,967
We have one ramyeon.

134
00:10:01,033 --> 00:10:02,333
Did they order ramyeon too?

135
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:04,266
-No, we have a new customer.
-We do?

136
00:10:25,467 --> 00:10:27,300
We have a cool-looking gentleman here.

137
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:29,266
Where do you want me to sit?
Over there?

138
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,600
Any table you like.

139
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,867
-Are you a TV star too?
-No.

140
00:10:35,066 --> 00:10:38,300
I'm not a Korean TV star.

141
00:10:38,367 --> 00:10:45,233
We just wanted to try something
other than Mexican food.

142
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,767
So when we saw Korean food,
we were like, "Yeah!"

143
00:10:47,767 --> 00:10:50,533
We had a lot of tacos and burritos,

144
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,333
so we just wanted something else.

145
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,400
Where are you from?

146
00:10:53,467 --> 00:10:54,400
Amsterdam.

147
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:56,934
-Oh.
-Yeah.

148
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,166
Where are you from?

149
00:10:58,233 --> 00:11:02,900
I started out in Boston,
and ended up in San Francisco.

150
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:08,333
Would you like a glass of wine?

151
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,834
-No, thank you.
-No? Okay.

152
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,500
Thank you.

153
00:11:34,433 --> 00:11:38,567
I think it's better
to add the egg with a cup like this.

154
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:11,867
Should I put some on?

155
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,667
Careful, It's hot.

156
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,333
It looks delicious. Thank you.

157
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:43,533
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

158
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:46,333
Enjoy your meal.

159
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:50,166
Thank you.
It was a pleasure chatting with you.

160
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,934
Same here.

161
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,300
Can I visit you when I go to Amsterdam?

162
00:12:55,367 --> 00:12:56,266
Of course.

163
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,667
I can give you a tour.

164
00:12:57,734 --> 00:12:59,433
I know the best spots.

165
00:13:06,567 --> 00:13:09,266
Use the chopsticks for the noodles

166
00:13:09,333 --> 00:13:14,300
and the spoon for the soup.
It'll be much easier.

167
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,600
So you twirl the noodles around
with the chopsticks?

168
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:19,000
Yes, that's one way.

169
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,834
You can you the fork if you want.

170
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:24,700
Yeah, it'll be easier.

171
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:30,266
He's having it like pasta.

172
00:13:33,033 --> 00:13:36,533
You can hold it like this.
Then it's easier.

173
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,400
-I can't.
-Okay.

174
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:40,533
Just enjoy your meal. It's fine.

175
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,500
As long as you enjoy it.

176
00:13:52,633 --> 00:13:53,567
Do you like it?

177
00:13:53,633 --> 00:13:56,000
Yes, it's delicious.

178
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,467
Oh, my, my...

179
00:14:09,133 --> 00:14:11,533
-There are so many people now.
-I know.

180
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:12,800
To have dinner, I suppose?

181
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,767
Seriously, so many people are walking by.

182
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,100
I think now is the peak hour.

183
00:14:36,633 --> 00:14:38,967
Hello.

184
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:41,000
We have a child customer.

185
00:14:45,133 --> 00:14:46,467
Do they have what I like?

186
00:14:46,533 --> 00:14:48,700
Why don't you check yourself?

187
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:50,900
I don't like any of these.

188
00:14:50,967 --> 00:14:53,100
It looks nice. There's gimbap.

189
00:14:55,467 --> 00:14:57,200
Hello.

190
00:15:02,934 --> 00:15:04,367
Can I order this?

191
00:15:04,433 --> 00:15:05,934
This is gimbap.

192
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,767
-Gimbap.
-Gimbap.

193
00:15:07,834 --> 00:15:09,667
What's inside?

194
00:15:09,734 --> 00:15:11,967
There are three different kinds.

195
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:14,633
There's beef, and this one's vegetarian.

196
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,000
And this has tuna inside.

197
00:15:17,066 --> 00:15:18,567
It looks good.

198
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,300
No, I was explaining to the kid.

199
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,567
We're Turkish.

200
00:15:23,633 --> 00:15:25,266
You're Turkish. From Turkey?

201
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:26,467
We're from Korea.

202
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,200
I live here. So you're from Korea?

203
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,166
Yes, Korea.

204
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:30,734
-Nice.
-These are Korean food.

205
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
They're all Korean. Nice.

206
00:15:32,867 --> 00:15:34,967
Do you know Korea?

207
00:15:39,133 --> 00:15:42,300
Okay, it was nice to meet you.
We'll come back later.

208
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:45,533
Okay. See you again.
It was nice meeting you.

209
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,133
-Bye. See you.
-Thank you.

210
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:13,667
We're done, so we're gonna leave.

211
00:16:13,734 --> 00:16:15,834
-I'll go out with you.
-Yes.

212
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:18,166
Thank you. It was really good.

213
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:19,266
Thanks for coming.

214
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,266
-Bye.
-Bye.

215
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,967
Very delicious. Thank you.

216
00:16:22,033 --> 00:16:23,467
What is your name?

217
00:16:23,533 --> 00:16:24,633
My name?

218
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:28,433
Seo Jin.
This restaurant is named after my name.

219
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:30,333
-Is that you?
-Yeah, that's me.

220
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,567
That's so cool.

221
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,600
-Thank you. Bye.
-Bye.

222
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,500
I'll do the dishes for you
for the time being.

223
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:56,000
-Do you know why?
-Why?

224
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,834
Because I'm a cool person.

225
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,533
You are very nice.

226
00:17:03,033 --> 00:17:04,433
Oh, I'm not.

227
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,967
You are.

228
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,900
Are we gonna keep the restaurant open?

229
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,800
-I don't know.
-If we wait,

230
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,567
we'll get more customers.

231
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:15,233
-Do you want to keep it open?
-Yes.

232
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,266
-I'm having fun.
-I also want to.

233
00:17:22,233 --> 00:17:27,433
Tae Hyung says
he wants to get more customers.

234
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:29,333
He said he's having fun.

235
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:33,233
Just for your information.

236
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,900
I think this is it though.

237
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,000
Let's close the restaurant.

238
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,700
Let's go home.

239
00:17:52,834 --> 00:17:54,800
At first,

240
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:59,734
I didn't want to work so much,
so I wished we had few customers

241
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,233
but nobody came, and it made me feel bad.

242
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,000
So when the customers came, I got happy.

243
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,266
Thanks for cooking.

244
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:31,767
The bottom of my feet hurts.

245
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,767
Me too. My heels hurt.

246
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,867
My soles and calves hurt.

247
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,066
I have the massager for feet.

248
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:43,567
By the way, Seo Jin, tomorrow,
I'll need much less time for the prep.

249
00:18:44,734 --> 00:18:46,166
To be honest,

250
00:18:46,233 --> 00:18:49,033
I wasn't busy at all today.

251
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,734
All I did was relay the orders…

252
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:53,767
Well, we didn't have
many customers today, so…

253
00:18:53,834 --> 00:18:55,400
By the way,

254
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:58,000
our menus are too difficult.

255
00:18:58,066 --> 00:19:01,633
Some Korean foods are famous,

256
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,667
but these seem new to them.

257
00:19:04,734 --> 00:19:07,700
Some people
just checked the menu and left.

258
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:15,033
Are you looking up the menus?

259
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,433
I'm just searching what menus there are.

260
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,200
We definitely need some meaty menus.

261
00:19:23,266 --> 00:19:26,533
Let's just see what sells more tomorrow.

262
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:29,533
Including a new pork menu.

263
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,567
Spicy pork gimbap?

264
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:34,033
How do we make it?

265
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,367
Pork.

266
00:19:35,433 --> 00:19:37,033
And the marinade?

267
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,367
I learned the recipe.

268
00:19:38,433 --> 00:19:40,934
-Is it a new marinade?
-Yes, new.

269
00:19:41,133 --> 00:19:43,333
It's a little spicy, right?

270
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,166
-Yes.
-So, pork gimbap?

271
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:50,266
Should we add a new corn dog menu too?

272
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:54,533
Adding potatoes on the original
and half-and-half corn dogs.

273
00:19:54,567 --> 00:19:55,834
That's two new menus.

274
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:59,233
That's a lot more menus.

275
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,000
It's not much extra work.

276
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,834
No, it's not.

277
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:04,967
-It's so heavy.
-Right, the potatoes.

278
00:20:05,467 --> 00:20:06,834
Oh, no. What do I do?

279
00:20:06,934 --> 00:20:09,367
Oh, whatever.

280
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:17,400
Look how beautiful it is.

281
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:25,800
We should change the menu board again.

282
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,600
How about adding the pork gimbap and...

283
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,233
I think he's falling asleep.

284
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,967
I'm so sleepy all of a sudden.

285
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,066
-I just... I'm so sleepy all of a sudden.
-Go to bed.

286
00:20:51,367 --> 00:20:54,066
Your eyelids got droopy.

287
00:20:55,166 --> 00:20:57,066
I was just looking at that thing,

288
00:20:57,133 --> 00:21:00,066
and all of a sudden,
I started to get really sleepy.

289
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:04,433
That must be because of
today's emotional roller coaster ride.

290
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,667
He must've been quite nervous today.

291
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:18,734
I can't see very well. I need this.

292
00:21:19,133 --> 00:21:20,900
But you haven't tried it. Is it okay?

293
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,567
What... Now I see everything clear.

294
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,433
-What did he say?
-"Now I see everything clearly."

295
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,033
So that's the smile of capitalism.

296
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,166
What should we do?

297
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,166
I feel like having some egg ramyeon.

298
00:21:54,266 --> 00:21:56,800
Jjajang ramyeon for me.

299
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:58,667
Ramyeon? Again?

300
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,467
Don't you want ramyeon again?

301
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:06,667
Yes, I remember.

302
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,667
-So funny.
-How is it?

303
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,266
It's so good!

304
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,867
My goal is to cook 100 ramyeons here.

305
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,033
We eat so much ramyeon.

306
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,734
How could you eat ramyeon every night?

307
00:22:57,233 --> 00:22:59,767
Let's move on.

308
00:23:00,533 --> 00:23:02,300
-All right. Let's go.
-Okay.

309
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,867
Today, I'll cook until I die.

310
00:23:04,934 --> 00:23:06,066
Seo Jun.

311
00:23:06,133 --> 00:23:10,100
Could you mix the jjajang ramyeon
with the hot ramyeon?

312
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:12,867
We don't have many ramyeons left.

313
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:15,500
Because they eat them every day.

314
00:23:15,567 --> 00:23:17,033
They eat them up every night.

315
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,066
Are you digesting it okay?

316
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:40,333
We leave at 11:40 tomorrow, okay?

317
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:27,734
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

318
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,166
Looking cool, Seo Jun.

319
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,834
What's with those pants?

320
00:24:33,033 --> 00:24:35,734
It's white.

321
00:24:42,467 --> 00:24:43,867
Is that shorts or a skirt?

322
00:24:43,967 --> 00:24:46,367
It's a skirt that looks like shorts.

323
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,867
Why are you being so picky
about how they dress?

324
00:24:49,934 --> 00:24:51,967
It's a uniform.

325
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,100
That's so outdated.

326
00:24:53,166 --> 00:24:55,500
We have a dress code here,
and it's the uniform.

327
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:03,567
Today is our second day here,

328
00:25:03,633 --> 00:25:06,166
so we're gonna be open until late.

329
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:07,633
And we'll go to work late.

330
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,300
As long as Tae Hyung does his job,
it'll be fine.

331
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:14,266
As long as he does the prep all right…

332
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,967
Is there a way I can complain anonymously?

333
00:25:21,567 --> 00:25:25,200
They're about to form a labor union.

334
00:25:25,266 --> 00:25:27,300
I will not tolerate labor unions
in Jinny's Kitchen.

335
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:29,200
-Pardon?
-It is not allowed.

336
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,734
When it's about to be formed,
I'll make him an executive.

337
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,433
And executives can't join a union.

338
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,834
Then there will be too many executives.

339
00:25:36,967 --> 00:25:39,200
Well, a union of two doesn't…

340
00:25:39,266 --> 00:25:41,467
We have two regular staff
and three executives?

341
00:25:45,367 --> 00:25:47,734
Tae Hyung lost faith in Yu Mi too.

342
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,066
-Really? Why?
-She betrayed him yesterday.

343
00:25:50,133 --> 00:25:52,333
No, I didn't. What are you talking about?

344
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,800
-Well…
-You're just trying to come between us.

345
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:56,800
Yu Mi suddenly told me

346
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:58,800
that tomorrow, I will have to go to work

347
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,266
one hour early with Woo Shik.

348
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:02,233
She said this to me.

349
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:07,900
We are now in Atlanta.

350
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:10,000
I'm flying to Cancún now.

351
00:26:10,066 --> 00:26:12,533
Who do you think will
welcome you the most?

352
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:18,633
To be honest,
I don't think I'll be welcomed.

353
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,867
They'll probably say,
"Why did you come so late?"

354
00:26:21,934 --> 00:26:23,300
They'll pick on me like that.

355
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:25,066
But I know it's because they care.

356
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,900
Who do you miss the most?

357
00:26:45,667 --> 00:26:48,400
I kind of miss Seo Jin.

358
00:26:48,467 --> 00:26:52,000
Since this is his first time being boss,

359
00:26:52,066 --> 00:26:55,934
he must be struggling a lot himself.

360
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,867
I wonder how he's holding up.

361
00:26:59,934 --> 00:27:04,000
When he's troubled, he needs my help.

362
00:27:05,433 --> 00:27:08,633
He probably needs my help.

363
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:12,433
I'm on my way, sir.

364
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,867
I'll see you soon.

365
00:27:25,633 --> 00:27:28,166
There are definitely more people
on the street today.

366
00:27:29,433 --> 00:27:30,967
Compared to yesterday, right?

367
00:27:31,033 --> 00:27:33,667
Yeah. I see lots of tourists.

368
00:27:33,934 --> 00:27:35,033
Here we are.

369
00:27:46,633 --> 00:27:48,100
Hello.

370
00:27:49,033 --> 00:27:51,100
It's the fun prep time again.

371
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:53,300
-Mr. Park.
-Yes?

372
00:27:53,333 --> 00:27:54,667
We're opening at two.

373
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,834
At two, I know.

374
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,900
Can we open by two?

375
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:05,433
Can we open by two?

376
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,367
Make the impossible possible. Just do it.

377
00:28:11,433 --> 00:28:14,500
-You can do it before two, right?
-Of course.

378
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:18,166
It's past 1 PM, why aren't people coming?

379
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:26,667
I think we should open a little later.

380
00:28:26,734 --> 00:28:28,266
Around 2 PM.

381
00:28:31,467 --> 00:28:33,967
-Go and write it down on a paper.
-Write what?

382
00:28:34,033 --> 00:28:34,900
That we open at 2 PM.

383
00:28:35,066 --> 00:28:37,367
-Opening hours?
-Yes. Is 2 PM all right?

384
00:28:48,467 --> 00:28:49,934
Here you go, Yu Mi.

385
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,367
-Thank you.
-Where should I put it?

386
00:28:52,433 --> 00:28:53,900
Hey.

387
00:28:53,967 --> 00:28:56,367
Should we make it 2:15 PM or 2 PM?

388
00:28:57,967 --> 00:28:59,333
What time is it now?

389
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,700
He said 2 PM.

390
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:03,033
Should I just write 15?

391
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:03,934
How about 10?

392
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,367
Should I write 10 then?

393
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,467
Where should I put it?

394
00:29:13,767 --> 00:29:16,467
At the entrance, under the menu.

395
00:29:21,734 --> 00:29:24,567
-Seo Jun, start with tteokbokki.
-Okay.

396
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,734
Seo Jin, could you stir this
once in a while?

397
00:30:38,233 --> 00:30:40,000
Rice.

398
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:41,133
Rice.

399
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:54,066
How will it turn out?

400
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,967
It's good? Are you sure?

401
00:30:58,033 --> 00:31:00,133
-I'm good at this.
-You did a great job.

402
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,533
It tastes amazing.

403
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:10,567
You put the mask on.

404
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,233
Say when. Let's just add extra
and throw out the rest.

405
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,166
-Do you want me to grind it?
-That would be nice, thanks.

406
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:44,200
Could you cut those?

407
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,433
Done.

408
00:32:36,233 --> 00:32:37,667
Very picante.

409
00:32:37,734 --> 00:32:40,533
-It's very spicy?
-Yes, very spicy.

410
00:32:53,533 --> 00:32:54,600
It's going too slow.

411
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,433
There we go

412
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,600
I'm trying to look cool.

413
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:27,300
My dream is to become a chef,

414
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:28,967
but in reality, I'm an assistant.

415
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:40,867
Hello.

416
00:33:40,934 --> 00:33:42,300
Are you open?

417
00:33:42,367 --> 00:33:43,834
We open at 2 o'clock.

418
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:47,066
And in the evening?

419
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,800
For dinner? What time?

420
00:33:48,867 --> 00:33:51,300
Around 6:30 PM?

421
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:53,533
Yes, it's possible.

422
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,200
Should we make a reservation?

423
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,700
It's okay. You can just walk in.

424
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:59,266
-Okay, thank you.
-Thank you.

425
00:34:03,633 --> 00:34:05,867
-Can I take a picture?
-Sure.

426
00:34:09,533 --> 00:34:12,333
This one's in English
and this one is in Spanish.

427
00:34:14,767 --> 00:34:16,867
SWEET

428
00:34:16,934 --> 00:34:21,367
I'll recommend this restaurant
to the other guests in my hotel.

429
00:34:21,433 --> 00:34:23,400
Thank you. Thank you very much.

430
00:34:24,433 --> 00:34:27,500
Thank you. I'll see you then. Two o'clock.

431
00:34:34,767 --> 00:34:36,266
It's so interesting.

432
00:34:36,467 --> 00:34:39,900
To see Korean food in Mexico.

433
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,900
Is it?

434
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,367
We'll eat here tonight.

435
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,700
Okay.

436
00:34:46,033 --> 00:34:47,734
-See you tonight.
-Okay.

437
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,567
Did they book a table?

438
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:54,433
-He's coming back in the evening.
-Today?

439
00:34:55,166 --> 00:34:56,166
This evening?

440
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:06,500
Why does the boss seem happy again?

441
00:35:06,567 --> 00:35:07,800
We got a reservation.

442
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:19,767
He must be feeling very happy.

443
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:24,033
-We're about to open soon, so...
-We are?

444
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:40,266
-We're adding the potato corn dogs today?
-Yes.

445
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,767
Wow, it looks good.

446
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:51,066
-Done with the batter, right?
-Yes.

447
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,266
Hey, it's time to open.

448
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,367
-I am ready.
-Come on out.

449
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:17,100
Tae Hyung, flip the open sign.

450
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:18,767
I'm opening.

451
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,033
Hello. How are you?

452
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,367
-Hello.
-Hello.

453
00:36:29,433 --> 00:36:32,500
-Are you open?
-Yes, we are.

454
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:35,367
A table for three, please.

455
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,967
Come in, please.

456
00:36:37,033 --> 00:36:39,900
-Hello. Nice to meet you.
-Good afternoon.

457
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:42,066
Good afternoon.

458
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,500
Take any table you like.
You can order here.

459
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,367
Okay.

460
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:51,133
No bulgogi, no galbi?

461
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:53,533
Bulgogi? We have bulgogi gimbap.

462
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,700
Let me try that.

463
00:36:54,767 --> 00:36:56,900
-Bulgogi gimbap?
-Yes, please.

464
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:01,133
-I'll have a gimbap too.
-Two sparking

465
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,233
-and one Sprite.
-No coke?

466
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,734
You don't have Korean beer?

467
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,967
Sorry.

468
00:37:09,033 --> 00:37:10,867
-No soju?
-No, sorry.

469
00:37:10,934 --> 00:37:12,133
Soju and beer...

470
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:20,200
We just opened,
and we got customers already.

471
00:37:20,266 --> 00:37:21,567
I have a good feeling.

472
00:37:21,633 --> 00:37:23,367
We might end up having 15 groups.

473
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:25,333
I'll do these dishes real quick.

474
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,700
Could you get the orders?

475
00:37:26,767 --> 00:37:27,834
Okay.

476
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:10,066
Oh, boy.

477
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,433
Whew, I'm safe.

478
00:38:18,834 --> 00:38:21,400
We got two bulgogi gimbap.

479
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:24,133
-Two bulgogi gimbap?
-Two.

480
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,200
Oh, no.

481
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,400
What did we get?

482
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,467
We got two bulgogi gimbaps.

483
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,867
And one corn dog for us.

484
00:38:46,233 --> 00:38:48,333
Thank you very much.

485
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,300
That man over there is a singer.

486
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,967
The man with the bandana?

487
00:38:58,033 --> 00:38:59,266
Yes.

488
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:04,967
-Is he famous?
-Yes, very.

489
00:39:05,033 --> 00:39:07,066
-Really?
-Really.

490
00:39:07,133 --> 00:39:09,066
He looks very handsome. Is that why?

491
00:39:09,133 --> 00:39:11,300
Everyone over there is good-looking.

492
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:12,700
Right?

493
00:39:12,767 --> 00:39:14,166
Look.

494
00:39:14,233 --> 00:39:16,934
Do you see the GoPro? It's a GoPro.

495
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,834
I should keep my neck straight
to hide the wrinkles.

496
00:39:28,767 --> 00:39:32,166
-Did you order a corn dog?
-Yes.

497
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:35,333
I wonder what Korean corn dogs are like.

498
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:56,066
These days, I think about what to do
with the second chapter of my life.

499
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,433
Bulgogi gimbap is really hard.

500
00:40:46,467 --> 00:40:48,000
Take this with you.

501
00:41:02,133 --> 00:41:04,100
It opened up a little.

502
00:41:05,066 --> 00:41:06,734
Stop.

503
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,333
Stop coming out.

504
00:41:15,533 --> 00:41:16,967
Here comes the corn dog.

505
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:24,967
It's hot. Be careful.

506
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:32,300
Very good.

507
00:41:32,367 --> 00:41:34,266
-Korean corn dog?
-Yes, Korean style.

508
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,834
It's hot, so be careful.

509
00:41:37,533 --> 00:41:39,467
-It already has the sauce on.
-Yes.

510
00:41:43,166 --> 00:41:45,133
Will there be more people coming?

511
00:41:47,667 --> 00:41:49,900
-We're the only customers here.
-Right.

512
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,233
Excuse me, order here first.

513
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:15,166
Let's see.

514
00:42:15,233 --> 00:42:17,300
"Gimbap de bulgogi?"

515
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,033
You want one?

516
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,500
I want to try the one below.

517
00:42:20,567 --> 00:42:22,033
This one.

518
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,400
-The vegan one?
-The vegan one.

519
00:42:24,467 --> 00:42:25,767
Any drinks?

520
00:42:26,934 --> 00:42:29,300
-Two cokes, please.
-Two? Two cokes?

521
00:42:31,533 --> 00:42:34,200
We have one more group.

522
00:42:34,266 --> 00:42:35,300
Wow, today...

523
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:38,033
I have a good feeling about today.

524
00:42:39,967 --> 00:42:41,934
Two gimbaps.
One bulgogi and one fried tofu.

525
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,233
But I made two bulgogis.

526
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,300
Seo Jin, one bulgogi gimbap is ready.

527
00:42:46,367 --> 00:42:49,700
But they ordered two bulgogi gimbaps.

528
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:52,667
Wouldn't it be weird
if we serve them separately?

529
00:42:52,734 --> 00:42:55,800
Do we have something to cover the food?

530
00:42:55,867 --> 00:42:57,834
Yes, cover it with something like that.

531
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,633
Does it taste good?

532
00:43:23,700 --> 00:43:24,734
It's okay.

533
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,934
Is it tasty?

534
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,734
How's their sausage?

535
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,967
There's no sausage.

536
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
There's no sausage?

537
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:32,467
No.

538
00:43:32,533 --> 00:43:34,066
Maybe I should ask for a refund.

539
00:43:37,233 --> 00:43:39,233
-Can I ask you something?
-Yes.

540
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,467
There's no sausage inside.

541
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,734
-The sausage.
-Sausage?

542
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,367
There's no sausage inside.

543
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,400
Perfect.

544
00:43:49,467 --> 00:43:50,834
-Okay?
-I got it.

545
00:43:50,900 --> 00:43:53,533
-Cheese first and then sausage.
-Yes.

546
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:56,033
Hey, let's share it together.

547
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,100
No, I'm good.

548
00:43:57,166 --> 00:43:59,367
I'll have my bulgogi gimbap.

549
00:44:02,433 --> 00:44:05,734
Seo Jun, did you serve the gimbap yet?

550
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:07,066
Gimbap?

551
00:44:07,133 --> 00:44:08,700
The one I made.

552
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:20,300
One gimbap is ready. It's for that table.

553
00:44:20,367 --> 00:44:22,233
We're gonna serve two at the same time.

554
00:44:22,266 --> 00:44:23,400
It's for that table.

555
00:44:23,467 --> 00:44:24,467
They ordered two.

556
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:26,133
No, they ordered two.

557
00:44:30,533 --> 00:44:31,533
They ordered two too.

558
00:44:31,567 --> 00:44:32,767
They ordered one.

559
00:44:32,834 --> 00:44:34,767
No, it says two on the slip.

560
00:44:34,834 --> 00:44:37,066
-It's written on the bottom.
-Where?

561
00:44:41,467 --> 00:44:42,333
Right?

562
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:44,600
-It's two.
-Oh, no. Hold on.

563
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,834
We have customers again.

564
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,133
Hello.

565
00:45:07,333 --> 00:45:09,767
Yu Mi, relax.
You can take all the time you need.

566
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:12,000
We have more customers.

567
00:45:12,066 --> 00:45:14,767
Looks like
we're gonna make some profit today.

568
00:45:21,333 --> 00:45:24,367
This caught my eye.

569
00:45:24,633 --> 00:45:27,667
It's made with rice cake.

570
00:45:29,967 --> 00:45:32,133
-One of each.
-One of each of these?

571
00:45:34,533 --> 00:45:37,567
-Coke? One?
-Three.

572
00:45:44,967 --> 00:45:46,000
Yu Mi.

573
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,667
-One bulgogi, one fried tofu.
-What?

574
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:50,934
Bulgo…

575
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,467
Bulgogi…

576
00:45:52,533 --> 00:45:54,000
I don't think I can make it.

577
00:45:56,433 --> 00:45:58,500
Today is a tough day for Yu Mi.

578
00:45:58,567 --> 00:45:59,967
They all ordered gimbap.

579
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,133
Gimbap…

580
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,500
We got too many gimbap orders.

581
00:46:06,567 --> 00:46:09,033
Yu Mi can't seem to handle it.

582
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,900
-She just has to take her time.
-Huh?

583
00:46:14,233 --> 00:46:15,200
Yu Mi, take it easy.

584
00:46:15,433 --> 00:46:17,166
I can't. They've waited long.

585
00:46:18,934 --> 00:46:21,066
Slow is better than messing up.

586
00:46:21,667 --> 00:46:24,300
-Take it slow.
-They've been waiting for too long.

587
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:36,166
Rack your brain, Jung Yu Mi.

588
00:46:39,133 --> 00:46:40,567
Let's just go for it.

589
00:47:04,266 --> 00:47:07,000
I just didn't want them
to wait for too long.

590
00:47:08,667 --> 00:47:09,800
And…

591
00:47:09,867 --> 00:47:11,533
One is rolled nicely,

592
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,533
but the other one fell apart.

593
00:47:33,734 --> 00:47:34,834
Here we go.

594
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,100
-Chopsticks?
-Yes.

595
00:47:55,166 --> 00:47:57,500
-It looks really nice.
-Thank you.

596
00:48:10,633 --> 00:48:12,433
Okay, let me steal one.

597
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,300
It's good. I like it.

598
00:48:21,367 --> 00:48:22,233
It's refreshing.

599
00:48:22,266 --> 00:48:24,100
-Perfect for the weather.
-Right.

600
00:48:24,633 --> 00:48:26,900
I could have it a little spicier. You?

601
00:48:26,934 --> 00:48:28,000
Ask for Sriracha.

602
00:48:28,066 --> 00:48:29,633
No, Robert.

603
00:48:29,633 --> 00:48:31,567
You must learn to enjoy all flavors.

604
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:32,600
He's right.

605
00:48:32,667 --> 00:48:34,433
This is not supposed to be spicy.

606
00:48:36,433 --> 00:48:38,266
-Thanks, Gabriel.
-No problem.

607
00:48:38,333 --> 00:48:42,367
So this is like the street versions

608
00:48:42,433 --> 00:48:44,066
of bulgogi and galbi.

609
00:48:44,133 --> 00:48:46,800
This is what they sell on Korean streets.

610
00:48:51,233 --> 00:48:53,500
It's really good.

611
00:48:53,567 --> 00:48:55,500
It's so good.

612
00:48:58,066 --> 00:49:00,233
It tastes really good.

613
00:49:10,567 --> 00:49:13,000
Seriously, it's really good.

614
00:49:13,066 --> 00:49:15,133
-It's very good.
-Thank you.

615
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,533
Thank you very much.

616
00:49:27,233 --> 00:49:29,200
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

617
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:31,800
Let's see. Look at the details.

618
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,767
Hey, baby.

619
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:38,033
Should I take the hat off?

620
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,333
"I have no hair! I'm bald!"

621
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:49,934
Look at his shiny head.

622
00:50:00,734 --> 00:50:03,600
It's a Coke.

623
00:50:06,667 --> 00:50:08,300
What are you looking at now?

624
00:50:08,367 --> 00:50:11,166
Probably the tree over there.

625
00:50:19,467 --> 00:50:21,700
The baby is smiling at him.

626
00:50:30,467 --> 00:50:32,800
It's okay. I can do it.

627
00:50:33,166 --> 00:50:34,934
A bulgogi and fried tofu.

628
00:50:52,834 --> 00:50:54,567
It's for the people over there.

629
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:59,333
-What about the sauce?
-I'm going to do it here.

630
00:51:14,233 --> 00:51:15,600
Oh, it looks delicious.

631
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:30,133
Thank you.

632
00:51:33,867 --> 00:51:35,367
Mine has meat and yours…

633
00:51:35,433 --> 00:51:37,467
It's vegetarian.

634
00:51:37,533 --> 00:51:39,934
By the way, your utensils…

635
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,700
They're made of metal.

636
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,600
-Okay.
-Nice.

637
00:51:46,667 --> 00:51:49,000
I keep dropping it.

638
00:51:49,066 --> 00:51:52,133
I'm so bad with chopsticks.

639
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:54,166
-Is it working out for you?
-Sure.

640
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,567
I think I should just use the forks.

641
00:52:09,734 --> 00:52:11,166
What did you order?

642
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,834
The beef one.

643
00:52:17,433 --> 00:52:19,700
-Come on.
-Does that face mean you like it?

644
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,600
It's really good.

645
00:52:27,667 --> 00:52:29,400
I like it.

646
00:52:29,467 --> 00:52:31,800
Me too.

647
00:52:31,867 --> 00:52:33,333
It's so refreshing.

648
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,633
This one is really good.

649
00:52:36,133 --> 00:52:38,166
-Do you wanna try?
-Sure.

650
00:52:38,233 --> 00:52:39,767
I'll take one.

651
00:52:39,834 --> 00:52:41,300
Okay, go on.

652
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,800
You're so much better than me.

653
00:52:45,867 --> 00:52:47,734
No, I'm not.

654
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,967
Thank you.

655
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:23,400
Good.

656
00:53:32,867 --> 00:53:35,233
Do you know what this is?

657
00:53:35,333 --> 00:53:37,567
-It's for opening bottles.
-A bottle opener?

658
00:53:37,633 --> 00:53:39,867
We can't take it with us though.

659
00:53:40,433 --> 00:53:41,734
Do you sell this?

660
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:43,000
-No.
-No?

661
00:53:43,066 --> 00:53:44,934
If you want, take it as a souvenir.

662
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,133
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

663
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,100
Give it to me.

664
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,467
-Blue? Or...
-Just pick one.

665
00:54:01,867 --> 00:54:03,400
I want the blue one.

666
00:54:03,433 --> 00:54:05,300
No, you gotta put it on your shirt.

667
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,633
-Is this you?
-It's me.

668
00:54:08,133 --> 00:54:09,233
Thank you.

669
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:11,300
It's that man.

670
00:54:13,934 --> 00:54:16,066
You put it there.

671
00:54:24,066 --> 00:54:28,500
Seo Jin, we have one fried tofu,
one bulgogi, and one tteokbokki, right?

672
00:54:28,567 --> 00:54:30,600
One bulgogi and one fried tofu, right?

673
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,667
We'll serve gimbap after the tteokbokki.

674
00:54:32,734 --> 00:54:34,367
-A tteokbokki order?
-Yes.

675
00:54:34,367 --> 00:54:35,433
That's great.

676
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,300
Is the tteokbokki boiled down?

677
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:43,800
No, not yet.

678
00:54:43,867 --> 00:54:45,600
Then let's boil it down.

679
00:54:57,233 --> 00:54:59,233
-What's up?
-I'll boil it down.

680
00:55:04,533 --> 00:55:06,266
Give it to me.

681
00:55:42,367 --> 00:55:43,967
It's hot, use that.

682
00:55:54,266 --> 00:55:56,066
Could you take this out

683
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:59,200
and add a little bit of tteokbokki sauce
before you serve it?

684
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,767
Seo Jin, could you take this out and…

685
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,033
Do you want me to show you?

686
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:28,867
Yes, please.

687
00:56:38,433 --> 00:56:39,600
Okay?

688
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:41,867
Thank you.

689
00:56:41,934 --> 00:56:45,967
I have to be carrying the baby,
so I'll eat first.

690
00:56:55,433 --> 00:56:56,800
Is it good?

691
00:56:56,867 --> 00:56:58,133
Mm-hmm.

692
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,700
How does it taste?

693
00:56:59,767 --> 00:57:03,900
It's a little spicy, but good.

694
00:57:03,967 --> 00:57:06,033
It looks like an empanada.

695
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:08,567
Right, it's like empanada.

696
00:57:27,567 --> 00:57:28,734
This one is good too.

697
00:57:30,633 --> 00:57:32,166
Do you want to try this?

698
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:33,300
Let me try it.

699
00:57:39,233 --> 00:57:41,834
-It's good, right?
-Yeah.

700
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,567
-Is Seo Jun's tteokbokki served?
-Yes.

701
00:57:44,967 --> 00:57:47,600
Yu Mi, this is a one and only gimbap
in the world.

702
00:58:01,033 --> 00:58:03,266
The other one is coming soon.

703
00:58:04,967 --> 00:58:06,533
It looks delicious.

704
00:58:06,934 --> 00:58:08,867
It looks professionally cooked.

705
00:58:18,967 --> 00:58:20,166
Thank you.

706
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:36,367
It's really good.

707
00:58:36,433 --> 00:58:38,800
On the scale of one to ten,
how would you rate it?

708
00:58:38,834 --> 00:58:42,433
I like it. It's excellent.

709
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,467
The girl cooking…

710
00:58:55,533 --> 00:58:57,867
-She looks like an actress.
-She is.

711
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,700
-Is she famous?
-Yes.

712
00:58:59,767 --> 00:59:02,333
And that young man as well?

713
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:05,100
-Yes, she's an actress. I'm an actor.
-Oh, and...

714
00:59:05,266 --> 00:59:07,433
-Is she on Korean dramas?
-Yes.

715
00:59:09,533 --> 00:59:12,367
Korean dramas in the US are so popular.

716
00:59:12,433 --> 00:59:14,433
They're all famous actors and actresses.

717
00:59:16,700 --> 00:59:18,233
This is crazy.

718
00:59:18,300 --> 00:59:19,967
-He's an actor too.
-Really?

719
00:59:20,033 --> 00:59:22,467
I thought he was just a restaurant owner.

720
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:27,467
How have you been?

721
00:59:27,467 --> 00:59:28,467
-Hey!
-Hello!

722
00:59:38,633 --> 00:59:41,967
-Have you guys tried the food here?
-Yes.

723
00:59:42,033 --> 00:59:45,033
-They came here yesterday.
-Oh, really?

724
00:59:45,100 --> 00:59:48,433
-You were here yesterday?
-Yes.

725
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,700
-Did you like it?
-Yes, it was good.

726
00:59:50,767 --> 00:59:52,400
-Did you already eat?
-Yes.

727
00:59:52,467 --> 00:59:53,533
How was it?

728
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,166
Very good.

729
00:59:55,233 --> 00:59:57,066
A little different.

730
00:59:57,133 --> 00:59:58,767
Enjoy your last night here.

731
00:59:58,834 --> 01:00:00,667
Thanks. You too.

732
01:00:01,567 --> 01:00:03,233
Okay, I'll go with you.

733
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:05,100
-Bye.
-Take care.

734
01:00:16,367 --> 01:00:19,066
How about we mix it with mayo?

735
01:00:19,934 --> 01:00:22,000
For the dipping sauce...

736
01:00:25,066 --> 01:00:28,066
I want to sell some gimbap tomorrow.

737
01:00:28,133 --> 01:00:29,433
Is it not spicy enough?

738
01:00:29,467 --> 01:00:31,900
Should we add chili inside?

739
01:00:31,967 --> 01:00:35,166
Or how about we serve it
with extra hot sauce?

740
01:00:35,233 --> 01:00:36,800
That sounds good.

741
01:00:36,834 --> 01:00:42,867
We can add mayo to the hot sauce
and make it mild.

742
01:01:19,433 --> 01:01:21,734
This is it? All right.

743
01:01:31,133 --> 01:01:33,133
Would you like a spicy sauce?

744
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,767
Would you like it with hot sauce?

745
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:41,967
Here.

746
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:43,734
Take it to them.

747
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:46,500
-Where?
-To the two men over there.

748
01:01:51,767 --> 01:01:52,867
Excuse me.

749
01:01:52,934 --> 01:01:55,367
Would you like it with hot sauce?

750
01:01:55,467 --> 01:01:57,266
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

751
01:01:57,333 --> 01:01:59,133
It can't be spicier than habanero.

752
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:02,533
Well, let's see.

753
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:07,767
No, it's not spicy.

754
01:02:12,667 --> 01:02:15,900
All right. Let me take it a little bit.

755
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,867
-I love it.
-Yeah.

756
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:51,333
It's raining again.

757
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,667
Look at the rain.

758
01:02:53,734 --> 01:02:56,867
This is nice.
Watching the rain makes me feel calm.

759
01:03:08,767 --> 01:03:10,033
Is this place open?

760
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:12,734
-Is it open?
-Yes, it's open.

761
01:03:18,834 --> 01:03:20,200
-Hello.
-Hello.

762
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,767
Here's the menu.

763
01:03:35,834 --> 01:03:37,700
Perfect.

764
01:03:37,767 --> 01:03:39,633
Do you have any recommendations?

765
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:41,567
What kind of food do you like?

766
01:03:41,633 --> 01:03:42,700
Spicy? Meat?

767
01:03:42,767 --> 01:03:44,633
-Spicy.
-You like spicy?

768
01:03:45,133 --> 01:03:47,500
I recommend tteokbokki.

769
01:03:47,934 --> 01:03:52,767
It's spicy. It's rice cake
with fried dumplings and stuff.

770
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:55,600
Okay. Let's do it.

771
01:03:55,667 --> 01:03:57,266
You like cheese? Or no cheese?

772
01:03:57,300 --> 01:03:59,734
-No cheese.
-Okay, one original tteokbokki.

773
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:00,934
Anything to drink?

774
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:02,600
-A Coke, please.
-One Coke.

775
01:04:08,467 --> 01:04:10,967
This is cool.

776
01:04:11,033 --> 01:04:12,200
Are you the chef?

777
01:04:12,266 --> 01:04:14,233
No, I'm the owner.

778
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,266
The chefs are in the kitchen.

779
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:17,800
Whose face is that over there?

780
01:04:17,834 --> 01:04:18,900
-That's my face.
-You?

781
01:04:20,967 --> 01:04:23,700
-Take this to your table.
-Thank you.

782
01:04:25,066 --> 01:04:26,467
Tae Hyung.

783
01:04:42,533 --> 01:04:43,734
Did we get an order?

784
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,467
-One original tteokbokki.
-Tteokbokki.

785
01:04:47,533 --> 01:04:49,400
Isn't the tteokbokki ready now?

786
01:04:49,467 --> 01:04:50,533
I think it is.

787
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,066
Bring it in.

788
01:05:26,533 --> 01:05:29,867
Let me show you how to eat it.

789
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:38,467
Perfect.

790
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:39,567
-Thank you.
-No problem.

791
01:05:39,600 --> 01:05:41,266
You can cut the rest yourself.

792
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:11,367
It's so smart. It's sitting down quietly.

793
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:24,633
Here, after five minutes of rain,
it becomes sunny again.

794
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,400
-Right?
-Yes.

795
01:06:28,233 --> 01:06:29,633
Now it's sunny again.

796
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:31,567
-Like it never rained.
-I know, right?

797
01:06:31,600 --> 01:06:35,133
It's incredible.
The rain clouds passed by.

798
01:06:42,133 --> 01:06:44,467
Shall we get going now?

799
01:06:46,567 --> 01:06:47,800
Enjoy.

800
01:06:47,867 --> 01:06:48,800
Thank you.

801
01:06:48,867 --> 01:06:50,266
Thank you very much.

802
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:51,333
Best of luck.

803
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:52,734
Thank you.

804
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:54,400
-Thank you very much.
-Bye.

805
01:06:55,967 --> 01:06:57,367
Thank you very much.

806
01:07:08,033 --> 01:07:09,133
Thank you.

807
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:16,000
I'm getting full.

808
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:18,400
Thank you.

809
01:07:21,133 --> 01:07:22,500
Was everything all right?

810
01:07:23,767 --> 01:07:24,333
Thank you.

811
01:07:24,867 --> 01:07:26,934
Looks like the busy hour is over.

812
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,467
We're suddenly slowing down.

813
01:07:50,934 --> 01:07:52,266
One for Yu Mi too.

814
01:08:07,633 --> 01:08:09,333
It's very smooth.

815
01:08:11,934 --> 01:08:13,367
Thank you.

816
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:23,467
-Shall we sit down for a while?
-Yeah.

817
01:08:23,467 --> 01:08:24,967
I think we can do that.

818
01:08:25,033 --> 01:08:26,600
Let's sit for a while.

819
01:08:29,767 --> 01:08:31,600
Why is the street

820
01:08:31,633 --> 01:08:33,734
-so empty?
-What?

821
01:08:33,867 --> 01:08:35,233
It's so empty.

822
01:08:35,333 --> 01:08:37,467
It must be because of the rain.

823
01:08:37,533 --> 01:08:40,700
I think we're gonna be
busy around six later.

824
01:08:40,767 --> 01:08:42,867
People will start coming after six, yeah.

825
01:08:42,934 --> 01:08:44,767
I heard Woo Shik took the bus.

826
01:08:47,066 --> 01:08:49,000
Make him change as soon as he arrives.

827
01:08:49,066 --> 01:08:50,133
Make him change!

828
01:08:50,133 --> 01:08:51,633
As soon as he arrives.

829
01:08:58,934 --> 01:09:00,767
How do you ask, "Is this tasty?"

830
01:09:00,834 --> 01:09:03,367
¿Está sabroso?

831
01:09:03,433 --> 01:09:05,266
Choose whatever is easy for you.

832
01:09:05,333 --> 01:09:08,066
¿Está sabroso? That's number one.

833
01:09:08,133 --> 01:09:10,133
Number two. ¿Está Rico?

834
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:12,333
Está comida…

835
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:15,633
les gusta…

836
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,133
a los Coreanos.

837
01:09:19,567 --> 01:09:21,467
What did you just say?

838
01:09:23,133 --> 01:09:24,767
That it's food Koreans like.

839
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:31,433
It's written here, and...

840
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:35,133
In Korean here.

841
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:36,500
Ponga la salsa.

842
01:09:36,567 --> 01:09:38,100
It's dip it with sauce.

843
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:40,867
¿Cuántos son?

844
01:09:40,934 --> 01:09:43,033
-How many people?
-That's all I need to know.

845
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:45,734
This is not easy. It's so hard.

846
01:09:45,934 --> 01:09:50,200
Picante means spicy.
Por aqui. Por favor.

847
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,867
No corn dogs today.

848
01:10:02,900 --> 01:10:03,834
We had one.

849
01:10:03,834 --> 01:10:06,567
If nobody orders the potato corn dog,
make me one.

850
01:10:06,633 --> 01:10:08,667
-Do you want one too?
-A corn dog?

851
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,767
-Do you wanna have one now?
-I want the potato one.

852
01:10:11,834 --> 01:10:12,767
Sure.

853
01:10:12,767 --> 01:10:14,734
You gotta have one with the cheese though.

854
01:10:14,734 --> 01:10:17,100
-We have a lot of them.
-Okay.

855
01:10:26,567 --> 01:10:28,467
We got a customer. Come on.

856
01:10:30,633 --> 01:10:32,500
-Hello. Please come in.
-Can I eat here?

857
01:10:32,533 --> 01:10:33,800
-Yes.
-Yes.

858
01:10:33,867 --> 01:10:35,433
Here's the menu.

859
01:10:42,433 --> 01:10:45,834
I just wanted to try it.
I saw it's Korean,

860
01:10:45,900 --> 01:10:48,467
-so I wanted to try the food here.
-Okay.

861
01:10:49,033 --> 01:10:51,467
The thing is, I don't know what to order.

862
01:10:52,467 --> 01:10:54,900
Okay. Let me explain to you.

863
01:10:55,867 --> 01:10:59,166
This is rice cake with fried dumplings.

864
01:10:59,233 --> 01:11:00,900
This is spicy, right?

865
01:11:00,967 --> 01:11:02,500
No, it's not that spicy.

866
01:11:02,567 --> 01:11:05,567
Not for me.
Because I'm not used to spicy food.

867
01:11:06,133 --> 01:11:08,266
Then you should try...

868
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,567
I recommend bulgogi.

869
01:11:11,633 --> 01:11:13,200
I think I'm gonna try that one.

870
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:17,767
So I'm gonna go with this one and a coke.

871
01:11:18,834 --> 01:11:20,300
Yu Mi.

872
01:11:22,767 --> 01:11:25,033
-A gimbap order?
-Yes, bulgogi.

873
01:11:25,100 --> 01:11:27,734
-It's the hardest one.
-Let's go, Yu Mi.

874
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:34,033
-Don't be so nervous.
-I won't.

875
01:11:34,100 --> 01:11:35,800
It's just one, so…

876
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,633
I'll go like this...

877
01:11:43,333 --> 01:11:44,433
Nice.

878
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:26,867
Hello.

879
01:12:28,333 --> 01:12:30,333
Hello, here's the menu.

880
01:12:37,367 --> 01:12:38,767
Thank you.

881
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,200
Where are you from?

882
01:12:42,266 --> 01:12:43,400
Puerto Rico.

883
01:12:43,467 --> 01:12:45,567
-Puerto Rico.
-Oh, Puerto Rico.

884
01:12:45,633 --> 01:12:46,467
What about you?

885
01:12:46,533 --> 01:12:48,800
-I'm from Madrid, Spain.
-Your change.

886
01:12:52,967 --> 01:12:54,133
What do you recommend?

887
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,467
What do I recommend? Okay…

888
01:12:55,533 --> 01:12:57,266
Is this cheese?

889
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:59,667
This is a bit spicy.

890
01:12:59,734 --> 01:13:03,467
And this is rice cake with hot sauce.

891
01:13:03,533 --> 01:13:05,033
It comes with fried dumplings.

892
01:13:05,100 --> 01:13:07,600
Okay. Interesting.

893
01:13:08,233 --> 01:13:10,400
I'm gonna try it.
I've never had it before.

894
01:13:10,467 --> 01:13:11,767
-Cheese tteokbokki?
-Yes.

895
01:13:11,834 --> 01:13:13,734
The difference is the cheese, right?

896
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,333
Yup, it's spicy. Is it okay?

897
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:16,867
Yeah, I love spicy.

898
01:13:17,667 --> 01:13:20,000
Do you have something like…

899
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:21,700
white wine?

900
01:13:21,734 --> 01:13:23,633
-Yes. White wine?
-Okay.

901
01:13:27,266 --> 01:13:28,834
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

902
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:31,600
Seo Jun.

903
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:39,633
Tae Hyung,
it's time to prepare some mozzarella.

904
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:41,200
Okay.

905
01:13:49,433 --> 01:13:50,834
Tae Hyung!

906
01:13:50,900 --> 01:13:52,600
Could you prepare the sauce?

907
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,033
Two sauces, right?

908
01:13:54,066 --> 01:13:56,266
-He doesn't like spicy.
-Oh, right.

909
01:14:02,934 --> 01:14:04,233
Sesame seeds.

910
01:14:15,266 --> 01:14:16,900
Is the Coke from Korea too?

911
01:14:16,967 --> 01:14:18,600
No.

912
01:14:18,667 --> 01:14:20,500
We just put the sticker on.

913
01:14:22,633 --> 01:14:25,100
Korean street food. Nice.

914
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,633
Is it your first time here?

915
01:14:35,700 --> 01:14:36,800
-Yes.
-Okay.

916
01:14:36,867 --> 01:14:38,367
First time in Mexico? Bacalar?

917
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,800
Bacalar.
I've been living in Mexico for a while.

918
01:14:40,867 --> 01:14:41,967
What about you?

919
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,467
I've been here many times.

920
01:14:43,467 --> 01:14:45,100
It's my second time in Bacalar.

921
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:46,900
-Are you traveling alone?
-Yes.

922
01:14:46,934 --> 01:14:48,633
That's cool.

923
01:14:48,700 --> 01:14:50,300
I'm traveling by myself too.

924
01:14:50,367 --> 01:14:52,400
I wanted to try Korean food.

925
01:14:52,467 --> 01:14:54,433
I see. Nice.

926
01:15:06,867 --> 01:15:09,700
What is this?

927
01:15:09,767 --> 01:15:12,200
You ordered bulgogi gimbap.

928
01:15:12,266 --> 01:15:15,266
I thought it'd be served on a plate.

929
01:15:15,333 --> 01:15:16,700
So this is how it's served.

930
01:15:16,767 --> 01:15:19,100
-It's vegetable wrapped with laver.
-Oh, okay.

931
01:15:19,133 --> 01:15:21,066
Do you know how to use chopsticks?

932
01:15:21,133 --> 01:15:23,266
Yes, I can.

933
01:15:23,333 --> 01:15:25,834
-Could you take a photo of me?
-Sure.

934
01:15:25,900 --> 01:15:27,800
So I can remember this.

935
01:15:27,867 --> 01:15:30,834
Eating Korean food in Mexico.

936
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:32,567
Something I've never done before.

937
01:15:35,233 --> 01:15:39,000
-I want to have that in the background.
-It's in the background.

938
01:15:39,066 --> 01:15:40,600
One, two, three. Cheese.

939
01:15:40,600 --> 01:15:42,667
Forget about the camera and act natural.

940
01:15:42,700 --> 01:15:45,233
As if I'm not being photographed.

941
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:50,266
One, two, three. I'll take two to be safe.

942
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:53,433
Very nice.

943
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:55,400
Thank you so much. Love the photos.

944
01:15:59,200 --> 01:16:01,233
I'm hungry, so I'll start eating this.

945
01:16:01,300 --> 01:16:03,333
Would you like to try some?

946
01:16:03,400 --> 01:16:04,867
What did you order?

947
01:16:04,934 --> 01:16:08,200
I ordered something spicy.

948
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:12,834
They said it's traditional Korean food.

949
01:16:44,900 --> 01:16:46,333
Well done.

950
01:16:48,367 --> 01:16:49,834
Put it in the middle.

951
01:16:52,033 --> 01:16:53,066
That's good.

952
01:17:06,867 --> 01:17:08,333
Use this…

953
01:17:09,033 --> 01:17:10,333
-to cut it.
-Oh, okay.

954
01:17:12,233 --> 01:17:14,066
-Perfect. Thank you.
-Enjoy.

955
01:17:29,367 --> 01:17:31,066
It's very good.

956
01:17:37,767 --> 01:17:38,834
It's so good.

957
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,633
-You must like spicy food.
-Yes.

958
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:45,667
-I'll make you a corn dog now.
-Okay.

959
01:18:02,767 --> 01:18:04,500
It's really good.

960
01:18:04,567 --> 01:18:06,333
It is really good.

961
01:18:06,400 --> 01:18:09,200
I guess we should get more fries diced.

962
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,367
We're already out after making three.

963
01:18:19,800 --> 01:18:22,166
This is not easy.

964
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,233
It's hard to keep the cheese
from coming out.

965
01:18:30,533 --> 01:18:31,667
Only ketchup?

966
01:18:31,667 --> 01:18:34,600
No. I want ketchup and mustard.

967
01:18:42,667 --> 01:18:44,533
-Let's eat together.
-Okay.

968
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:46,200
I'll join you after this.

969
01:18:46,266 --> 01:18:47,300
Thanks.

970
01:18:56,433 --> 01:18:57,433
It's tasty.

971
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,900
Feed him one.

972
01:19:00,734 --> 01:19:02,333
-Feed him?
-Yes.

973
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,233
He's over there in the back.

974
01:19:06,300 --> 01:19:08,200
Just tell him to poke his face.

975
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,567
Let's eat inside.

976
01:19:18,734 --> 01:19:20,500
Why did you take it out?

977
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:31,166
You take two.

978
01:19:36,800 --> 01:19:38,934
-The potato one is better.
-It's good.

979
01:19:41,867 --> 01:19:42,867
Do you want more?

980
01:19:52,567 --> 01:19:56,633
Bulgogi gimbap is
the easiest to fall apart.

981
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:07,467
I said this place is amazing.

982
01:20:07,533 --> 01:20:08,533
It really is.

983
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,834
I don't know if you've been there,

984
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:14,000
but there's a pier
near the 36th and 37th street.

985
01:20:14,066 --> 01:20:15,934
Oh, right.

986
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,100
I've been there.

987
01:20:17,166 --> 01:20:19,600
The park that has been closed is open now

988
01:20:19,667 --> 01:20:21,967
and there's a new big pier.

989
01:20:22,033 --> 01:20:23,934
I went there to see the sunrise.

990
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,266
I swam there yesterday.

991
01:20:25,333 --> 01:20:27,400
It was so beautiful.

992
01:20:27,467 --> 01:20:30,066
When the sun rises, the water is so warm.

993
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:12,433
It's a dog.

994
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:14,433
Seo Jin, a dog came in.

995
01:21:19,767 --> 01:21:20,934
Over there.

996
01:21:37,066 --> 01:21:39,100
It's gonna come every day now.

997
01:21:39,166 --> 01:21:40,967
Where do you live, doggy?

998
01:21:41,567 --> 01:21:44,033
Look at him, he's lying down.

999
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:00,900
-Nice to meet you.
-Thank you, I'll see you then.

1000
01:22:00,934 --> 01:22:02,633
-Two o'clock.
-Okay.

1001
01:22:04,066 --> 01:22:05,667
-Are you coming in?
-Can I?

1002
01:22:09,500 --> 01:22:10,400
Hello.

1003
01:22:12,967 --> 01:22:13,934
Here's the menu.

1004
01:22:15,633 --> 01:22:17,800
-Do you have rice?
-Rice, here.

1005
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:22,100
Beef, vegetarian...

1006
01:22:23,467 --> 01:22:25,133
-I'll do this.
-This one?

1007
01:22:25,533 --> 01:22:28,400
Do you have Coke?

1008
01:22:35,066 --> 01:22:36,600
Bulgogi.

1009
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:39,300
-Is it done already?
-Yes.

1010
01:22:39,567 --> 01:22:42,400
Already? Hold on.

1011
01:22:55,667 --> 01:22:57,400
This is the spicy one.

1012
01:22:57,467 --> 01:23:02,100
Tell her, "Está bien con salsa picante."

1013
01:23:11,633 --> 01:23:12,867
Spicy sauce.

1014
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,033
Is it very spicy?

1015
01:23:21,133 --> 01:23:22,033
Thank you.

1016
01:23:51,667 --> 01:23:53,233
It went over there.

1017
01:23:53,300 --> 01:23:54,900
I guess it smelled the food.

1018
01:24:00,100 --> 01:24:03,166
Maybe it came to cheer you up.

1019
01:24:05,867 --> 01:24:07,433
It's okay.

1020
01:24:07,500 --> 01:24:11,133
This is normal in Bacalar.

1021
01:24:11,200 --> 01:24:13,133
Having a couple of dogs around.

1022
01:24:56,734 --> 01:24:58,367
It's raining again.

1023
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:18,400
Please, do you need the menu?

1024
01:25:18,467 --> 01:25:20,300
Wait, we have two groups.

1025
01:25:21,967 --> 01:25:23,533
Oh, no. We got group customers.

1026
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,233
You better be ready.

1027
01:25:25,300 --> 01:25:26,400
Lots of customers.

1028
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,800
I know.

1029
01:25:27,867 --> 01:25:29,433
Two half-and-half?

1030
01:25:32,967 --> 01:25:35,266
Hello. Please come in.

1031
01:25:56,567 --> 01:25:58,433
260, please.

1032
01:26:03,767 --> 01:26:06,166
Just give us 200 pesos back.

1033
01:26:08,300 --> 01:26:10,567
It's a German way of tipping.

1034
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:13,800
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much.

1035
01:26:14,233 --> 01:26:16,500
Tae Hyung, can you give this to them?

1036
01:26:32,967 --> 01:26:34,500
Hello.

1037
01:26:34,567 --> 01:26:36,800
We have two more customers.

1038
01:26:41,066 --> 01:26:43,467
They're looking for the menu.

1039
01:26:46,367 --> 01:26:48,200
Sorry. The menu is here.

1040
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:51,633
You can order here.

1041
01:26:51,633 --> 01:26:52,900
Thank you.

1042
01:27:01,533 --> 01:27:03,233
I'll get a Sprite too.

1043
01:27:05,433 --> 01:27:06,600
-2 Sprites?
-Yes.

1044
01:27:07,233 --> 01:27:08,300
Tae Hyung.

1045
01:27:09,567 --> 01:27:11,567
-Yu Mi. Here.
-Yes?

1046
01:27:22,667 --> 01:27:26,166
They wouldn't come to give us the menu.

1047
01:27:27,467 --> 01:27:29,233
Excuse me, order here.

1048
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:30,300
The menu...

1049
01:27:33,166 --> 01:27:34,667
Oh, we should order there.

1050
01:27:41,734 --> 01:27:43,834
I'm gonna have…

1051
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:46,367
I'll go with this one.

1052
01:27:46,433 --> 01:27:48,367
-Cheese ramyeon?
-Yes.

1053
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:52,533
-Gimbap?
-Gimbap.

1054
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,000
Okay. Soy sauce and…

1055
01:27:55,100 --> 01:27:56,700
How about the one with tuna?

1056
01:27:56,767 --> 01:27:59,867
Yeah, it doesn't matter.

1057
01:27:59,934 --> 01:28:02,000
Tuna gimbap.

1058
01:28:03,333 --> 01:28:04,600
And some white wine.

1059
01:28:04,667 --> 01:28:06,066
Two white wines?

1060
01:28:06,133 --> 01:28:07,100
Two.

1061
01:28:07,166 --> 01:28:08,533
Okay.

1062
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:15,433
-Tuna.
-Oh? So that's two tunas.

1063
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:17,600
-Tae Hyung.
-Yes.

1064
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:19,734
Seo Jin, there's one more coming up.

1065
01:28:22,033 --> 01:28:24,066
I'll carry it. It might roll off.

1066
01:28:24,133 --> 01:28:27,600
I'll turn it around
so it's easier for him to hold.

1067
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:32,100
You ring the bell.

1068
01:28:46,467 --> 01:28:48,433
-Thank you.
-You're welcome. Enjoy.

1069
01:28:49,633 --> 01:28:52,300
-It's amazing.
-Let's try Korean food.

1070
01:28:53,100 --> 01:28:54,133
All right.

1071
01:29:03,266 --> 01:29:04,500
It's so good.

1072
01:29:16,500 --> 01:29:18,767
Should I ask them how it tastes?

1073
01:29:20,100 --> 01:29:21,734
How does it taste?

1074
01:29:22,867 --> 01:29:24,834
It's sweet and has cheese inside.

1075
01:29:24,900 --> 01:29:26,900
I thought there'd be sausage inside.

1076
01:29:26,967 --> 01:29:29,400
I think
the second half has a sausage inside.

1077
01:29:29,467 --> 01:29:31,433
But it's good. It's worth a try.

1078
01:29:31,467 --> 01:29:34,300
-It's worth a joy.
-Thank you. You too.

1079
01:29:39,033 --> 01:29:41,467
Look. My half is finished.

1080
01:29:42,533 --> 01:29:44,500
Now, it's a sausage.

1081
01:29:44,567 --> 01:29:46,700
Yes, there's a sausage.

1082
01:30:08,233 --> 01:30:10,200
Thank you.

1083
01:30:13,834 --> 01:30:14,834
Thank you.

1084
01:30:18,934 --> 01:30:21,500
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1085
01:30:49,033 --> 01:30:50,800
Thanks.

1086
01:31:07,667 --> 01:31:08,667
One or two?

1087
01:31:08,734 --> 01:31:10,133
Two.

1088
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:11,734
Order two more.

1089
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,333
Two corn dogs? Okay.

1090
01:31:15,400 --> 01:31:16,433
-All right.
-Yes?

1091
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:19,033
What is it?

1092
01:31:20,266 --> 01:31:21,767
Two original corn dogs.

1093
01:31:21,834 --> 01:31:24,800
-Two?
-Yes. Let's start.

1094
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:30,166
I'll do the dishes now.

1095
01:31:43,033 --> 01:31:44,200
Hi. Here's the menu.

1096
01:31:49,967 --> 01:31:51,266
We got two more customers.

1097
01:31:57,734 --> 01:31:59,834
One cheese and one original ramyeon.

1098
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:01,867
-One each?
-Yes.

1099
01:32:01,934 --> 01:32:04,900
And one red wine as well.

1100
01:32:04,967 --> 01:32:07,500
-One or two?
-Just one, please.

1101
01:32:07,567 --> 01:32:10,200
Do you want some water?

1102
01:32:11,834 --> 01:32:13,667
Hey, we got an order.

1103
01:32:30,867 --> 01:32:32,834
Oh, boy.

1104
01:32:32,900 --> 01:32:34,500
Aye, aye, aye.

1105
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:38,266
They don't seem very busy.

1106
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:54,633
Jinny's Kitchen…

1107
01:32:54,700 --> 01:32:56,433
Oh, they have customers.

1108
01:32:58,900 --> 01:33:00,600
They have lots of customers.

1109
01:33:07,967 --> 01:33:09,834
-Tae Hyung, here's the container.
-Okay.

1110
01:33:09,834 --> 01:33:11,266
Could you get me the sauce?

1111
01:33:34,600 --> 01:33:37,367
Woo Shik, come on. Go to the kitchen.

1112
01:33:37,433 --> 01:33:40,333
-Woo Shik, come on. Go to the kitchen.
-Oh, okay.

1113
01:33:42,533 --> 01:33:44,033
Woo Shik.

1114
01:33:44,100 --> 01:33:46,033
-We're busy.
-Come on.

1115
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:47,300
Tae Hyung.

1116
01:33:48,367 --> 01:33:49,567
Go on in.

1117
01:33:59,266 --> 01:34:01,100
-So many customers.
-Come in.

1118
01:34:01,166 --> 01:34:02,967
This place is cool.

1119
01:34:04,367 --> 01:34:06,800
Buenas noches.

1120
01:34:06,867 --> 01:34:08,500
Put the bag down.

1121
01:34:14,367 --> 01:34:16,533
Woo Shik, how long was the trip?

1122
01:34:16,600 --> 01:34:17,967
Well…

1123
01:34:19,066 --> 01:34:20,500
By car it took...

1124
01:34:20,734 --> 01:34:22,867
The car ride took four, five hours.

1125
01:34:27,367 --> 01:34:29,266
-Woo Shik, do the dishes.
-Okay.

1126
01:34:29,333 --> 01:34:30,633
Woo Shik, do the dishes.

1127
01:34:31,734 --> 01:34:33,967
-I did the dishes.
-We have more.

1128
01:34:40,367 --> 01:34:44,500
Did it really take four hours from Cancún?

1129
01:34:51,166 --> 01:34:52,266
Here are some more.

1130
01:34:54,867 --> 01:34:56,200
Tae Hyung, take this.

1131
01:34:56,233 --> 01:34:57,200
Give it to Woo Shik.

1132
01:34:57,266 --> 01:34:58,533
Woo Shik.

1133
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:00,667
-Yes?
-Be careful.

1134
01:35:26,633 --> 01:35:30,867
You know the foot massager?

1135
01:35:33,834 --> 01:35:35,200
Hey, you're both wearing

1136
01:35:35,266 --> 01:35:36,767
bandanas.

1137
01:35:36,834 --> 01:35:38,367
They're cute.

1138
01:35:40,066 --> 01:35:42,033
We've got yours too.

1139
01:35:47,800 --> 01:35:49,767
While I was away,

1140
01:35:49,834 --> 01:35:51,700
you guys became similar.

1141
01:35:55,233 --> 01:35:56,834
You'll become like us tomorrow.

1142
01:35:57,266 --> 01:35:59,100
Hopefully I can fit in here.

1143
01:36:03,033 --> 01:36:04,600
Do you need any help?

1144
01:36:04,667 --> 01:36:06,300
Help me with the sauce.

1145
01:36:06,367 --> 01:36:08,900
Could you get me two bowls like these?

1146
01:36:08,967 --> 01:36:12,367
This one's very spicy,
and this is that one.

1147
01:36:12,433 --> 01:36:14,633
-Could you prepare them?
-Okay.

1148
01:36:24,967 --> 01:36:27,667
Excuse me.

1149
01:36:27,734 --> 01:36:29,667
Where's the sauce paper…

1150
01:36:29,734 --> 01:36:31,633
I mean, the sauce container…

1151
01:36:34,166 --> 01:36:35,333
The small sauce bowls.

1152
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:37,333
Oh, that. That's next to Yu Mi.

1153
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:38,867
-Under the tteokbokki.
-Oh.

1154
01:36:41,367 --> 01:36:43,734
Be careful. It runs out abruptly.

1155
01:36:43,900 --> 01:36:46,400
That's the spicy one.

1156
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:49,300
This is the mild sauce
and this the spicy one.

1157
01:36:50,033 --> 01:36:52,233
Do it inside. It farts.

1158
01:37:07,767 --> 01:37:11,000
I didn't know what you were talking about.

1159
01:37:11,133 --> 01:37:12,567
You knew once you heard it, right?

1160
01:37:16,266 --> 01:37:19,800
He needs to learn things step by step.

1161
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:21,834
He doesn't know how things work.

1162
01:37:21,900 --> 01:37:23,467
Oh, that's the tteokbokki.

1163
01:37:23,533 --> 01:37:25,333
About tteokbokki…

1164
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,567
Whenever you walk by,

1165
01:37:27,633 --> 01:37:29,467
make sure to stir it like this.

1166
01:37:29,533 --> 01:37:31,266
Otherwise, it'll get scorched.

1167
01:37:32,633 --> 01:37:35,433
-And always keep this in mind.
-Keep what in mind?

1168
01:37:35,500 --> 01:37:37,033
You're Intern Choi, right?

1169
01:37:37,100 --> 01:37:39,533
I'm Intern Kim.

1170
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,667
Intern Kim is your senior.

1171
01:37:46,333 --> 01:37:48,066
Tomorrow is Sunday, and it's a big day.

1172
01:37:48,133 --> 01:37:49,967
We should add more menus.

1173
01:37:50,166 --> 01:37:52,100
-Three.
-Three? Three, please.

1174
01:37:56,600 --> 01:37:58,633
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1175
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:01,500
Everybody loves chicken.

1176
01:38:02,233 --> 01:38:03,967
Let's add seasoned fried chicken.

1177
01:38:04,033 --> 01:38:05,834
Anyone who likes spicy, will love it.

1178
01:38:07,233 --> 01:38:08,900
A ramyeon and gimbap combo?

1179
01:38:08,934 --> 01:38:11,333
I bet combos will be a hit.

1180
01:38:12,000 --> 01:38:14,934
Wow, the boss is working very hard.

1181
01:38:15,000 --> 01:38:17,200
-Hey, 20 minutes left.
-Okay.

1182
01:38:17,266 --> 01:38:19,000
Seo Jun, are you ready?

1183
01:38:19,066 --> 01:38:20,834
We have customers waiting outside.

1184
01:38:20,900 --> 01:38:23,233
-So many people.
-Do you wanna come in?

1185
01:38:23,567 --> 01:38:25,700
Seo Jin, we have customers.

1186
01:38:25,934 --> 01:38:27,166
Hello.

1187
01:38:27,900 --> 01:38:30,166
-Hello.
-Hello.

1188
01:38:30,233 --> 01:38:31,800
Four chickens.

1189
01:38:31,934 --> 01:38:34,133
-Another chicken order?
-We only have two to go.

1190
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:36,500
We might run out of chickens.

1191
01:38:36,567 --> 01:38:38,200
Take the orders.

1192
01:38:38,500 --> 01:38:40,166
Woo Shik!

1193
01:38:40,233 --> 01:38:42,066
Woo Shik, I think you should go.

1194
01:38:44,533 --> 01:38:45,900
We should fry it, huh?

1195
01:38:48,900 --> 01:38:50,667
People are waiting in line outside.

1196
01:38:50,734 --> 01:38:52,367
Wait, wait.

1197
01:38:52,433 --> 01:38:54,900
Why are we so busy?

1198
01:38:54,967 --> 01:38:55,934
We have a problem.

1199
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,300
We ran out of ingredients.

1200
01:38:57,367 --> 01:38:59,433
We don't even have glasses or cups.

1201
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:02,233
Are we having a crisis?

1202
01:39:02,333 --> 01:39:06,867
Seo Jun and I are searching
for flights back to Korea.

1203
01:39:06,934 --> 01:39:09,633
We earned more than 10,000 pesos.
We can go home.

1204
01:39:09,700 --> 01:39:11,633
What's the point of being promoted?

1205
01:39:11,633 --> 01:39:13,100
I'm so…

1206
01:39:54,000 --> 01:39:57,233
JINNY'S KITCHEN
