JINNY'S KITCHEN

2
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,233
As soon as we hit 12,000, we'll close.

3
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,533
- 12,000, 12,000!
- 12,000, 12,000!

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,000
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

5
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,734
Let's go for the final day!

6
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,133
Prepping a lot today.

7
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,834
I'm going to chicken hell now.

8
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:37,967
Let's grate them all.

9
00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:40,133
What if we don't have customers today?

10
00:00:40,233 --> 00:00:41,767
We're open, right?

11
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:43,333
Why are there no customers?

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,934
Seriously, no one's coming.

13
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,867
Soon, people will rush in.

14
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:51,033
- Two?
- Nobody's coming.

15
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:52,667
We barely hit 2,000 now.

16
00:00:52,734 --> 00:00:54,800
How could no one come?

17
00:00:54,867 --> 00:00:56,333
Until we hit 10,000 today,

18
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,033
our restaurant will be open.

19
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:01,367
- We're six people.
- Okay.

20
00:01:01,767 --> 00:01:03,100
Are you paying together?

21
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,934
No, we're paying separately.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,633
All right, then. You ordered...

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,867
- Ramyeon.
- Ramyeon.

24
00:01:08,934 --> 00:01:09,934
Hellaspicy fricken.

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
- Fried tofu.
- Gimbap.

26
00:01:11,433 --> 00:01:14,433
Together? Separate? So, who's...

27
00:01:15,567 --> 00:01:16,900
The chibap...

28
00:01:27,166 --> 00:01:29,600
- Hello.
- Hello.

29
00:01:29,667 --> 00:01:31,066
Are you on holiday?

30
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:32,433
We live here.

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,500
- You live here.
- Yes.

32
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:35,567
- In Mexico?
- In Mexico.

33
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:36,734
The menu's here.

34
00:01:42,367 --> 00:01:44,066
Bulgogi rice for the kid.

35
00:01:44,066 --> 00:01:46,133
- The spicy pork rice.
- Spicy pork rice.

36
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,166
- I'll have tuna gimbap.
- One tuna gimbap?

37
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,133
Well,

38
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,800
the chicken is
one of the most popular menus here.

39
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:54,266
- Spicy fricken?
- Yes.

40
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,567
- We'll get that one too.
- One spicy fricken.

41
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,033
- So you ordered four in total.
- Yes.

42
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:00,667
I want pineapple juice.

43
00:02:00,734 --> 00:02:02,400
- Pineapple juice.
- Yes.

44
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:04,734
I'd like to get a Coke

45
00:02:04,767 --> 00:02:06,166
and a bottle of water too.

46
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:14,967
- Do you want to order it to-go?
- Yes.

47
00:02:15,033 --> 00:02:17,233
One chicken and… Just a second.

48
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:19,934
What's the best one?

49
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,433
- The best one.
- The best?

50
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,033
- Do you like spicy?
- Yes.

51
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,400
This is a little spicy.

52
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:28,767
- And this one.
- The spicy pork.

53
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,033
We're in trouble.

54
00:02:32,667 --> 00:02:33,767
Good luck, Yu Mi.

55
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:35,467
- What?
- Two rice, one gimbap.

56
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:42,467
Order.

57
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:46,066
That's a lot.

58
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:57,734
Here's water for you.

59
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:06,066
Coke, pineapple juice…

60
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:15,834
It was mineral water, right?
Not sparkling?

61
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:19,633
- Yes, you're right.
- Alright. And pineapple juice?

62
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:27,233
Hi, sweetie.

63
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,867
Here's water.

64
00:03:29,967 --> 00:03:32,200
- Coke.
- Thank you.

65
00:03:32,266 --> 00:03:33,266
Sure.

66
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,033
Then…

67
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:39,166
Is it all for black?

68
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:42,100
Yes, this is for to-go.

69
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:44,700
- Are all drinks served?
- Yes.

70
00:03:44,734 --> 00:03:46,967
- To the black table?
- Yes.

71
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,767
We have one pineapple juice left.
Is it served?

72
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,367
- I served the pineapple juice.
- There are two.

73
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:05,100
- Huh?
- One here

74
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:06,233
and one here.

75
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:11,300
I'll go ask.

76
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,667
Excuse me.
Are you missing one pineapple juice?

77
00:04:14,734 --> 00:04:16,033
No, we got it.

78
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:18,333
- I ordered one too.
- You did, sorry.

79
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,433
Oh.

80
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,000
Sorry, I thought that was it.

81
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,700
Here you go. Sorry about that.

82
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:36,500
No, it's fine. Thank you so much.

83
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,600
He's so nice.

84
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,767
Yeah, he's really sweet.

85
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:51,300
Two ramyeons, one chibap.

86
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:52,300
Another ramyeon?

87
00:04:52,367 --> 00:04:53,934
We got hellaspicy fricken too.

88
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,066
I got a pot ready for the ramyeon.

89
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:57,133
Thanks.

90
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:00,800
So this is the beginning of the rush.

91
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,500
Oh, that was fast.

92
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,600
Fried tofu gimbap.

93
00:05:36,934 --> 00:05:38,567
Hellaspicy fricken.

94
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:41,533
That looks so good.

95
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,133
- Ramyeon?
- Me. And her.

96
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,367
- Okay.
- Oh, that's a lot.

97
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:50,333
I don't know if I made a good choice.
It looks good.

98
00:05:51,433 --> 00:05:52,467
Wow.

99
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,667
It looks so good.

100
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,066
Oh, that's mine.

101
00:06:04,633 --> 00:06:05,767
- Thank you.
- Yes.

102
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,000
Oh, they're metal.

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,200
Sorry, I'm starting.

104
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:15,133
- But I can't help it.
- That looks so good.

105
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,333
These are very fancy chopsticks.

106
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,934
Yeah, but really weird.

107
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,233
- They're flat.
- Yeah, they're flat.

108
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,233
Not the chopsticks I expected.

109
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:42,300
Oh, that's spicy!

110
00:06:42,367 --> 00:06:44,567
Can I have a little bit too?

111
00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,166
It's good.

112
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:53,200
I'm glad I didn't order it.
It's too spicy for me.

113
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:55,033
Which makes it taste better.

114
00:06:57,533 --> 00:07:00,300
The noodles are really good.

115
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:03,000
When you leave them for too long,
they get soggy.

116
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,400
- But these are so nice.
- Yeah, they're nice.

117
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:09,667
Should go straight in?

118
00:07:09,734 --> 00:07:10,967
Yeah, all in.

119
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,166
It's good. It's very fresh.

120
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:25,233
Mmm!

121
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:28,567
Ramyeon is served, right?

122
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:29,900
- Ramyeon?
- Yes.

123
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,333
- One or two?
- Two.

124
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
- Two? Oh, this is served too.
- Yes.

125
00:07:34,467 --> 00:07:35,900
So chibap is left.

126
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,867
Bulgogi rice and chicken.

127
00:07:37,934 --> 00:07:39,266
- One hellaspicy…
- And chibap.

128
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,300
Okay.

129
00:08:01,934 --> 00:08:03,533
Did you do hellaspicy fricken?

130
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I need to do it.

131
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:05,934
Oh, there's one more.

132
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,133
The stove.

133
00:08:16,166 --> 00:08:17,600
What's wrong with me?

134
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:42,433
- We got a rice menu too?
- Yes.

135
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:45,567
- Rice.
- Is it finished?

136
00:08:45,633 --> 00:08:46,567
Yes.

137
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,367
This is for you, right?

138
00:08:49,433 --> 00:08:51,300
No, it's not.

139
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:53,233
- Chibap, right?
- Oh, that's…

140
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,333
- Sorry about that.
- No, it's okay.

141
00:08:56,333 --> 00:08:57,533
Thank you.

142
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:04,834
- You ordered bulgogi rice, right?
- Yes. Thank you so much.

143
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:06,600
Hellaspicy fricken.

144
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:19,333
Seriously, this is so good.

145
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,834
I'm having a really good time.

146
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,533
If anyone wants to try mine,
please say it.

147
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,367
Wanna try bulgogi rice?

148
00:09:28,467 --> 00:09:29,467
Why not?

149
00:09:31,033 --> 00:09:32,033
Is it good?

150
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,000
You like it?

151
00:09:35,567 --> 00:09:36,600
Mmm.

152
00:09:37,066 --> 00:09:38,500
Can I try your pickled radish?

153
00:09:38,533 --> 00:09:39,500
Of course.

154
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,700
Oh, that is nice.

155
00:09:44,767 --> 00:09:46,867
Very nice. It's sweet.

156
00:09:46,934 --> 00:09:48,667
Dian, want one?

157
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,533
Wanna try this?

158
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,867
There you go.

159
00:09:55,834 --> 00:09:57,533
Mmm.

160
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,200
What are those things inside?

161
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:01,300
Chicken.

162
00:10:01,367 --> 00:10:03,033
Oh, this is really good.

163
00:10:10,433 --> 00:10:12,133
Oh, none of them are yours.

164
00:10:12,934 --> 00:10:14,133
I should go help Yu Mi.

165
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,100
I got the chicken.

166
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:22,433
Yu Mi, I'll help.

167
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,967
- Did you see it?
- Yes.

168
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,100
Could you start with bulgogi then?

169
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,834
- I got the ingredients ready.
- Okay.

170
00:10:53,066 --> 00:10:55,100
I'll get the rice ready.

171
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,367
Don't mess this up, Jung Yu Mi.

172
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:37,333
You can do this, right?

173
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,734
You gotta roll it nicely.

174
00:12:28,834 --> 00:12:30,967
Seo Jin, here.

175
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:33,000
For the to-go customer. Take it.

176
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,533
Is it upside down?

177
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,533
I don't know. Just take it.

178
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,233
No, it's not.

179
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,800
That's how Woo Shik gave me.

180
00:12:41,867 --> 00:12:43,834
I need to do the rolling now.

181
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,100
- Go away.
- There are two.

182
00:12:45,166 --> 00:12:46,133
Just go.

183
00:12:58,667 --> 00:13:01,934
- Here you go.
- Thank you very much.

184
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,166
Here's your gimbap.

185
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,033
Rice.

186
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,900
I don't know how it'll taste, but…

187
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:17,967
- I'm sure it's good.
- We did our best.

188
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:19,467
- Thank you.
- Sure.

189
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:25,533
Mmm!

190
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
How did they spread the rice so thinly?

191
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,700
Let me try gimbap too.

192
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,767
It's rolled so beautifully.

193
00:13:42,767 --> 00:13:44,900
How did they cut the cucumbers like this?

194
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:46,900
- Is it even cucumber?
- It is.

195
00:13:51,433 --> 00:13:52,934
If, by any chance,

196
00:13:52,967 --> 00:13:55,166
this was cut by hand,
that would be amazing.

197
00:13:56,467 --> 00:13:58,266
They must've used a machine.

198
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:02,500
I'm gonna be a master of gimbap.

199
00:14:02,567 --> 00:14:04,400
This is nothing.

200
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,934
It's a duck!

201
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:20,033
- Say "Thank you."
- Thank you.

202
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,700
You should look at his face.
Say "Thank you."

203
00:14:23,734 --> 00:14:24,834
Thank you.

204
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,633
Are you guys coming from swimming?

205
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Yes.

206
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:31,000
We went to the lagoon.
Have you been there?

207
00:14:31,066 --> 00:14:32,734
Yeah, two days ago.

208
00:14:32,834 --> 00:14:34,367
The one right here, right?

209
00:14:34,433 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah, we went kayaking
and paddling this morning.

210
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:39,033
Oh, that's nice.

211
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,800
Beautiful. Definitely recommended.

212
00:14:40,867 --> 00:14:42,033
Where are you from?

213
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,200
France, the UK, Germany.

214
00:14:46,266 --> 00:14:47,200
- No?
- Yes.

215
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:48,667
Right? Well, Ecuador-born.

216
00:14:48,734 --> 00:14:50,734
Did you guys all meet here?

217
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,033
We study in Puebla.

218
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:55,400
And we're traveling now a little bit.

219
00:14:56,033 --> 00:14:57,266
How long are you staying?

220
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,100
It's been one week now.

221
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,934
Today is actually our last day.

222
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,667
- Today is the last day?
- Yes.

223
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:04,500
- Wow.
- Dang.

224
00:15:04,567 --> 00:15:06,233
We past this place yesterday

225
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,500
and said we should try eating here.

226
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,200
We have about one hour left now.

227
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:44,633
Let's go for 12,000, 12,000, 12,000!

228
00:15:51,834 --> 00:15:53,800
- Do you need any help?
- No.

229
00:15:59,734 --> 00:16:00,967
Should I put more water?

230
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,500
Should we marinate more beef?

231
00:16:44,967 --> 00:16:46,700
Oh, they're back.

232
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:48,500
They came again.

233
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:50,767
It's his third time visiting.

234
00:16:50,834 --> 00:16:52,567
We have a good return rate.

235
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,000
Let's taste Korean.

236
00:16:59,834 --> 00:17:01,400
See you tomorrow.

237
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,633
A friend!

238
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,934
Your baby is so cute.

239
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,934
Thank you.

240
00:17:20,467 --> 00:17:22,567
- Hi!
- How old is she?

241
00:17:22,633 --> 00:17:25,333
She's two years and ten months old.

242
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,800
She's a big baby.

243
00:17:26,867 --> 00:17:28,066
She's adorable.

244
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,333
She has pretty eyes.

245
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,633
Say "Thank you."

246
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:34,166
- She doesn't understand.
- It's okay.

247
00:17:34,567 --> 00:17:37,066
¡Hola! ¡Hola!

248
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,100
Hello.

249
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:41,633
- Hello.
- Hello.

250
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,800
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

251
00:17:43,967 --> 00:17:46,166
I'm not very hungry today.

252
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:48,967
I want something lighter.

253
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,367
- A gimbap...
- Tofu?

254
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,166
And for drink…

255
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,500
Watermelon juice.

256
00:17:56,567 --> 00:17:59,400
Something similar for the boy?

257
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,767
I think this would be the best option.

258
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:09,133
I'll get another, with tofu.

259
00:18:09,233 --> 00:18:12,600
This is the one I had. Chibap.

260
00:18:12,667 --> 00:18:14,300
And we have a new menu here.

261
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:15,967
- What is this?
- It's beef.

262
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,667
Okay. Let's try bulgogi rice.

263
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:21,200
- Bulgogi rice, okay.
- And do you have wine?

264
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:24,000
- Yes, we do.
- I would like that.

265
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:26,166
Mom.

266
00:18:26,233 --> 00:18:27,467
What do you want?

267
00:18:29,934 --> 00:18:31,100
- This?
- Yes.

268
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:32,467
Can I borrow this?

269
00:18:32,667 --> 00:18:35,066
- Or which one?
- This is for your table.

270
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:39,567
- So today is your last day?
- Yes.

271
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,266
How was your experience in Bacalar?

272
00:18:41,266 --> 00:18:42,734
It was great.

273
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,266
- And busy.
- And it was busy.

274
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:49,433
I love your T-shirt.

275
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,567
Oh, thank you.

276
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,100
Do you want ice?

277
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,934
- Or no ice?
- No ice, please.

278
00:19:05,266 --> 00:19:06,834
We'll sit here.

279
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,867
If you need a bigger table, use this.

280
00:19:08,934 --> 00:19:12,900
It's okay.
Today, we won't have many customers.

281
00:19:13,633 --> 00:19:14,667
Thank you.

282
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:19,066
Duck, duck!

283
00:19:19,133 --> 00:19:20,467
There's a ducky, huh?

284
00:19:20,533 --> 00:19:21,667
Yes.

285
00:19:21,734 --> 00:19:24,033
Just like the one you have, right?

286
00:19:24,867 --> 00:19:26,567
You have a ducky at home, right?

287
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:45,467
- It's for you.
- Thank you.

288
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,400
- Wow, a duck.
- Thank you.

289
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:50,600
He was asking for it.

290
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:51,633
Really?

291
00:19:53,767 --> 00:19:55,266
What does a duck say?

292
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:56,333
Quack, quack.

293
00:19:59,967 --> 00:20:01,266
Rice, gimbap.

294
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,734
- Got it.
- Okay.

295
00:20:18,133 --> 00:20:19,967
Could you make one bulgogi rice for me?

296
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,233
- Oh, sure.
- Thanks.

297
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:08,967
- I need your help.
- Sure?

298
00:21:09,033 --> 00:21:10,633
Four sauces.

299
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,166
- Four?
- Yes.

300
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,700
Can you move this away?

301
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,934
Could you move over?

302
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,700
It's hot in here. Do you have to be here?

303
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,066
- I'll put it here.
- Thanks.

304
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:47,266
- And this one here.
- Okay.

305
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,667
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

306
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:14,133
Let me try it.

307
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,166
Let's see how easy this will be.

308
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:27,667
The rice tastes good.

309
00:22:36,633 --> 00:22:38,567
Jonas, sit, my love.

310
00:22:38,633 --> 00:22:41,834
- Mom, water.
- Sweetie.

311
00:22:41,934 --> 00:22:44,734
Water?

312
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100
Mmm.

313
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,633
Very good.

314
00:23:01,867 --> 00:23:03,100
I love it.

315
00:23:03,166 --> 00:23:05,133
Can I try yours?

316
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,266
It's very good.

317
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,066
It's very good.

318
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,333
Want some more?

319
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:29,467
- Do you like it?
- Very!

320
00:23:33,633 --> 00:23:34,500
Jonas.

321
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,767
Jonas?

322
00:24:08,133 --> 00:24:09,133
Come here.

323
00:24:13,767 --> 00:24:14,800
Is it you?

324
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:24,033
This is a different dog.

325
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,100
- Huh?
- It's a different dog.

326
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,567
This one's a bit smaller.

327
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:30,934
It's a bit smaller.

328
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,533
- It's smaller.
- Right.

329
00:24:34,467 --> 00:24:36,033
That's not Perro.

330
00:24:37,166 --> 00:24:38,000
It's not Perro.

331
00:24:38,066 --> 00:24:39,133
It's not?

332
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,633
- It's some other dog.
- It's not.

333
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,900
Are you okay with dogs?

334
00:24:55,967 --> 00:24:57,367
Oh, yeah.

335
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,667
It's very cute.

336
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,467
I think she's still a puppy.

337
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:04,500
- Sorry?
- I think she's a puppy.

338
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,333
She's very sweet.

339
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:15,400
You came here already for more love?

340
00:25:24,633 --> 00:25:26,300
There's nothing to do.

341
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:33,000
I thought we would keep getting customers.

342
00:25:33,667 --> 00:25:34,734
But they stopped coming.

343
00:25:36,467 --> 00:25:38,233
No one.

344
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,367
We don't have customers.

345
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,467
Boy.

346
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,100
What do we do?

347
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:55,667
How's the boss doing?

348
00:25:55,734 --> 00:25:56,800
Not good.

349
00:26:04,233 --> 00:26:05,300
No more bulgogi?

350
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:07,200
- We can't make bulgogi rice?
- We can.

351
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:08,900
- Only for gimbap?
- I made more.

352
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,400
He says he marinated more.

353
00:26:10,533 --> 00:26:11,633
Hey.

354
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,834
Nobody told me about it.

355
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,233
We must sell rice menus.

356
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,033
Otherwise, we can't boost sales.

357
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,667
I heard there's none.

358
00:26:19,266 --> 00:26:21,567
The rice menus are our only hope.

359
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:23,867
When did you marinate it?

360
00:26:23,934 --> 00:26:25,266
I made some more.

361
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:27,066
- We must hit 12,000 today.
- For sure.

362
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:27,967
Well done.

363
00:26:31,767 --> 00:26:33,333
I think we're doomed.

364
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,767
Did we make, what, 4,000?

365
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:39,266
At least 5,000, I think.

366
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,767
Wow, that means

367
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,667
we need 7,000 to go home.

368
00:26:58,667 --> 00:26:59,834
Can I have one?

369
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,367
- Sure.
- Thanks.

370
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,433
Ah.

371
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:22,333
What are you calculating?

372
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,567
It'll only make you sad.

373
00:27:28,967 --> 00:27:30,400
It's actually not that bad.

374
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:39,433
In total, 6,600.

375
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:45,867
Did we hit 5,000?

376
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:47,900
- It's 6,600.
- Oh, you're right.

377
00:27:47,967 --> 00:27:49,000
That's not bad.

378
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,400
We'll get there by 8 PM.

379
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,834
Whoa, that was nice.

380
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,567
Oh, you put it there.

381
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,433
I took care of it all.

382
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:48,166
Maria.

383
00:28:48,233 --> 00:28:49,433
That's BTS.

384
00:28:49,734 --> 00:28:51,900
That guy is a member of BTS.

385
00:28:51,967 --> 00:28:53,000
What?

386
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:55,033
The guy over there is a member of BTS.

387
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,934
I know them very, very well.

388
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,266
No way.

389
00:28:58,333 --> 00:28:59,266
Where?

390
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,133
He was just there.

391
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,266
I'm 100 percent sure.

392
00:29:02,266 --> 00:29:04,967
My sister is a huge fan.

393
00:29:05,033 --> 00:29:08,200
Gosh, my sister's gonna freak out.

394
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:09,700
I know how big they are.

395
00:29:09,767 --> 00:29:12,200
They have a huge fan base.

396
00:29:12,266 --> 00:29:14,133
My sister has

397
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,300
hundreds of photos of them on her wall.

398
00:29:23,834 --> 00:29:25,767
It's him.

399
00:29:26,934 --> 00:29:28,266
I can see that.

400
00:29:28,333 --> 00:29:30,100
I'm 100 percent sure.

401
00:29:30,166 --> 00:29:32,166
He's got the vibes as well.

402
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,200
Okay, I'm gonna ask.
I need some napkins too.

403
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,834
- Can I ask a question?
- Yes.

404
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:45,433
You're V of BTS, right?

405
00:29:46,133 --> 00:29:47,667
You're V of BTS, right?

406
00:29:50,066 --> 00:29:51,166
Here you go.

407
00:29:58,033 --> 00:30:03,567
You should tell your sister about this.
She's gonna be so surprised.

408
00:30:12,233 --> 00:30:13,767
Whoa, I just had a dream.

409
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:16,266
In the dream, I became a singer.

410
00:30:22,066 --> 00:30:25,166
I’m gonna go to Seoul to go audition.

411
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:30,533
I can’t miss this audition, Boss

412
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,600
My dream is to sing

413
00:30:32,667 --> 00:30:33,834
at a carnival.

414
00:30:50,467 --> 00:30:51,467
Hola.

415
00:30:52,066 --> 00:30:53,266
Welcome back.

416
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,700
Hello.

417
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,200
- I'll get Jinny's Combo A.
- Got it.

418
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:09,667
How do we check the menu?

419
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,200
- Do you wanna come over here?
- There's the menu.

420
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,266
- I want…
- I need to take photos.

421
00:31:15,333 --> 00:31:16,900
Let's check the menu first.

422
00:31:16,934 --> 00:31:18,400
You might want something else.

423
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,100
Could you go take a photo of it?

424
00:31:24,467 --> 00:31:26,100
What do you want to have?

425
00:31:26,967 --> 00:31:28,333
I want…

426
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,166
You sure you don't want to see
other menus? We have time.

427
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,567
I don't remember what it was called.

428
00:31:36,433 --> 00:31:38,000
It's not spicy, is it?

429
00:31:38,066 --> 00:31:39,600
No.

430
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:41,533
The name was written outside. One sec.

431
00:31:41,533 --> 00:31:42,667
Okay, go take a look.

432
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:44,767
I need some time to pick mine anyway.

433
00:31:48,433 --> 00:31:51,333
Okay. Are you guys ready to go?

434
00:31:53,133 --> 00:31:54,533
Thank you.

435
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,600
Thank you.

436
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,867
Tae Hyung, could you wash the bowls
for ramyeon and rice?

437
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,333
The ramyeon bowls are there.

438
00:32:12,433 --> 00:32:13,834
I'll wash the rice bowls now.

439
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,667
Can we go home today, boss?

440
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:18,834
I don't think you can.

441
00:32:42,133 --> 00:32:43,166
- Hola.
- Hola.

442
00:32:44,133 --> 00:32:45,133
This way, please.

443
00:32:51,967 --> 00:32:52,967
Excuse me.

444
00:32:53,734 --> 00:32:55,834
You need to order over there.

445
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,333
They have the menu there.
You can pay there too.

446
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,567
Thank you.

447
00:32:59,633 --> 00:33:01,633
They'll serve the food to your table.

448
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,166
Oh, thank you.

449
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,000
I'll go with gimbap.

450
00:33:10,967 --> 00:33:12,567
Can I get one spicy pork gimbap?

451
00:33:12,633 --> 00:33:14,533
- One?
- Yes, one.

452
00:33:17,834 --> 00:33:20,400
What would you recommend?

453
00:33:20,467 --> 00:33:21,834
Oh, my recommendations.

454
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,433
I recommend rice.

455
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:28,100
Beef, pork, chicken. Here's the sample.

456
00:33:28,166 --> 00:33:29,734
Excuse me. Here.

457
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,000
And this is chibap.

458
00:33:32,066 --> 00:33:33,934
Oh, I wanna get this one.

459
00:33:35,333 --> 00:33:40,100
Okay, so one spicy pork,
one chibap, and one water?

460
00:33:52,767 --> 00:33:54,867
- Thank you.
- Take this to your table.

461
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:56,633
Giacomo.

462
00:33:58,567 --> 00:34:02,467
Other than two fried tofu gimbap,
what do you want?

463
00:34:02,533 --> 00:34:03,667
Why two?

464
00:34:03,734 --> 00:34:05,767
Because you're a messy eater.

465
00:34:05,834 --> 00:34:07,200
I don't wanna share mine.

466
00:34:07,266 --> 00:34:08,266
Okay.

467
00:34:08,867 --> 00:34:10,100
What do you wanna order?

468
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,700
Tuna.

469
00:34:11,767 --> 00:34:13,600
Okay.

470
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:16,166
And one ramyeon?

471
00:34:17,734 --> 00:34:21,800
- Two... Tofu gimbaps.
- Okay.

472
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,500
One tuna gimbap.

473
00:34:25,567 --> 00:34:27,867
One ramyeon.

474
00:34:27,934 --> 00:34:29,700
Two waters.

475
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:33,100
- Just mineral? Not sparkling water?
- Yes, mineral water.

476
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,033
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

477
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:41,667
Yu Mi, there are suddenly
lots of gimbap orders.

478
00:34:41,834 --> 00:34:42,767
I have to do spicy pork and…

479
00:34:42,834 --> 00:34:46,000
Two fried tofu gimbaps
and one tuna gimbap.

480
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:50,367
We got an order.

481
00:34:51,333 --> 00:34:52,800
We got one ramyeon.

482
00:34:52,867 --> 00:34:53,867
Okay.

483
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,200
Tae Hyung, how about
you make ramyeon here first?

484
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:13,333
Okay.

485
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:44,834
I'll be a master of gimbap.

486
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,767
I'm becoming one, right?

487
00:35:46,834 --> 00:35:48,533
This is nothing.

488
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,000
- Hello.
- Ready to order?

489
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Yes, I think so.

490
00:35:54,066 --> 00:35:56,166
I'd like to get this.

491
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,834
- Bulgogi gimbap?
- The beef, yes.

492
00:35:59,367 --> 00:36:01,934
What are
the most interesting things you've got?

493
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,100
I was thinking this one and this one.

494
00:36:04,166 --> 00:36:05,700
This is really hot.

495
00:36:05,767 --> 00:36:07,467
Spicy.

496
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:13,033
Well... Let's maybe start
with hellamyeon and a corn dog.

497
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,467
Then I might try this later.

498
00:36:15,533 --> 00:36:17,767
So, one hellamyeon
and a regular corn dog?

499
00:36:18,233 --> 00:36:20,066
Two sparkling water too.

500
00:36:20,133 --> 00:36:21,734
Okay, two sparkling waters?

501
00:36:22,834 --> 00:36:24,567
That'll be 390 pesos.

502
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:33,533
Look, Jonas.

503
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,000
No.

504
00:36:50,867 --> 00:36:51,934
Dad.

505
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,767
This one looks interesting.

506
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,834
Hi.

507
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:23,900
Hi, princess.

508
00:37:32,066 --> 00:37:34,734
Hey, it's getting full again.

509
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,100
Do we have new customers?

510
00:37:36,166 --> 00:37:39,233
I think we're getting more orders soon.

511
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,066
I think

512
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,233
we made about 6,800 pesos now

513
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,133
Did you hear
the boss' goal is 12,000, not 10,000?

514
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,800
Bulgogi gimbap.

515
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:01,967
Hey.

516
00:38:02,033 --> 00:38:03,367
I need to roll four more.

517
00:38:03,433 --> 00:38:04,800
- Oh, no.
- Hold on.

518
00:38:04,867 --> 00:38:06,233
You gotta hurry.

519
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:13,266
I'm busy, but I can do it.

520
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,433
I can…

521
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:40,667
Chibap?

522
00:38:40,734 --> 00:38:41,767
Me.

523
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,800
Thank you.

524
00:38:47,967 --> 00:38:48,934
Thank you.

525
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:54,100
What do you think it is?

526
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,567
- Very good.
- Is it good?

527
00:39:01,667 --> 00:39:03,633
Oh, it's spicy.

528
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,000
It's very spicy.

529
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,200
It's good.

530
00:39:11,066 --> 00:39:14,200
It's very good.

531
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:21,900
It's so good.

532
00:39:21,967 --> 00:39:22,900
Yeah?

533
00:39:28,567 --> 00:39:30,000
- Is it good?
- Huh?

534
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:31,600
- Is it good?
- Yes.

535
00:39:32,367 --> 00:39:33,400
It's good.

536
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:43,567
- It hit me with its tail.
- Yeah.

537
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:45,900
- It's gentle.
- It's got no respect.

538
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,533
What's your name, doggy?

539
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,166
Who's gonna order? You?

540
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:54,467
Will you order? Or Should I?

541
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,700
You do it.

542
00:39:55,767 --> 00:39:57,400
No, she'll get nervous.

543
00:39:57,467 --> 00:39:59,266
Then you do it.

544
00:39:59,333 --> 00:40:01,533
She can do it. I believe in you.

545
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:02,500
Hello.

546
00:40:05,066 --> 00:40:09,233
- Let's get bulgogi rice and the corn dogs.
- How many?

547
00:40:09,934 --> 00:40:11,533
Three bulgogi gimbaps, please.

548
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,734
- One?
- Three.

549
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,700
Three?

550
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:15,333
Okay.

551
00:40:17,767 --> 00:40:19,567
And three corn dogs.

552
00:40:19,633 --> 00:40:21,033
- Two?
- Three.

553
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,500
Three? Okay.

554
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,934
How about drinks?

555
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,533
Should we have Cokes?

556
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,333
- Three Cokes, please.
- Three Cokes.

557
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:36,367
Please take this to your table.

558
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:40,200
New order.

559
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:44,367
We got three bulgogi rice bowls.

560
00:40:44,433 --> 00:40:46,033
Bulgogi… Whoa.

561
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,333
Three bulgogi rice and three tater dogs.

562
00:40:51,433 --> 00:40:53,800
Three rice menus?

563
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:56,033
I bet Seo Jin is smiling from ear to ear.

564
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,033
- Woo Shik.
- Yes.

565
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,700
Three bulgogi rice.

566
00:40:58,767 --> 00:41:00,533
- Seo Jin.
- Hey. I'm in trouble.

567
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,967
We need more spring onions.

568
00:41:03,033 --> 00:41:04,100
Hold on a sec.

569
00:41:08,033 --> 00:41:09,834
- Three servings…
- All at once?

570
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,800
Try making them at once.

571
00:41:11,867 --> 00:41:13,400
Goodness. Okay.

572
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,367
Is anyone free?

573
00:41:16,433 --> 00:41:18,367
- No, no one's free.
- Nope.

574
00:41:21,233 --> 00:41:23,333
For the gray table, right?

575
00:41:24,066 --> 00:41:25,266
Let's take it easy.

576
00:41:25,333 --> 00:41:27,200
Yes, relax.

577
00:41:32,233 --> 00:41:33,333
What did you order?

578
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,333
Three of… What was it called?

579
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,367
Corn dogs?

580
00:41:37,433 --> 00:41:40,333
Three tater dogs.

581
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,834
We also ordered three rice menus
with beef.

582
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,433
Don't you think it'll be too much food?

583
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,533
I'm hungry.

584
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:49,100
She laughs when you said "mucho."

585
00:41:49,166 --> 00:41:50,934
Mucho, mucho.

586
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:02,400
Thank you very much.

587
00:42:02,467 --> 00:42:04,834
Bye-bye. Thank you.

588
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,233
Thank you.

589
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,400
Bye-bye.

590
00:42:08,433 --> 00:42:09,500
Do you need a chair?

591
00:42:12,867 --> 00:42:13,834
Thank you.

592
00:42:24,633 --> 00:42:26,734
I'll finish this quick and go help.

593
00:42:27,266 --> 00:42:29,266
- You can make hellamyeon, right?
- Oh, sure.

594
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,967
- Could you make one?
- Yes, Chef.

595
00:42:31,033 --> 00:42:32,433
I'll make all the corn dogs.

596
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,333
- Right. Make the corn dogs.
- Okay.

597
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,734
See you.

598
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,834
I should help you with the rice.

599
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,133
Yay!

600
00:42:41,834 --> 00:42:43,033
I'm gonna prove myself.

601
00:42:46,834 --> 00:42:48,300
All right.

602
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:50,066
Three minutes and 20 seconds.

603
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,200
And this one's 30 seconds.

604
00:42:52,266 --> 00:42:53,734
And this…

605
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:55,400
Okay. The math is done.

606
00:42:55,467 --> 00:42:56,700
One.

607
00:42:56,767 --> 00:42:58,500
Two.

608
00:42:58,567 --> 00:42:59,700
Three.

609
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:17,800
I look so busy.

610
00:43:17,867 --> 00:43:18,867
Hot!

611
00:43:19,834 --> 00:43:21,266
How did he manage all this?

612
00:43:26,233 --> 00:43:27,300
Gosh.

613
00:43:46,934 --> 00:43:47,934
Gold.

614
00:43:48,734 --> 00:43:49,767
Okay.

615
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:00,667
For the gold table.

616
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:03,300
Let me do the rice.

617
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:23,000
You guys are bronze. Okay.

618
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,633
- Are you sharing this?
- No.

619
00:44:43,333 --> 00:44:45,734
Oh, it's that ramyeon.

620
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:00,967
It's spicy, by the way.

621
00:45:04,834 --> 00:45:08,867
If you can't finish it
because it's too spicy…

622
00:45:08,934 --> 00:45:09,867
It is spicy, but…

623
00:45:11,233 --> 00:45:12,900
Is it too hot too?

624
00:45:14,166 --> 00:45:15,233
A little.

625
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,100
I'm scared.

626
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,433
Is it spicy?

627
00:45:30,633 --> 00:45:31,667
Very spicy?

628
00:45:34,233 --> 00:45:35,633
- Are you okay?
- Of course.

629
00:45:37,266 --> 00:45:39,433
Do you think your stomach will be fine?

630
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:40,867
It'll hurt.

631
00:45:40,867 --> 00:45:42,367
But it comes with the flavor.

632
00:45:44,266 --> 00:45:46,467
Have you tried anything spicier than that?

633
00:45:46,533 --> 00:45:47,867
I don't know.

634
00:45:53,033 --> 00:45:54,800
I haven't had this spicy food before.

635
00:45:55,834 --> 00:45:58,333
My gosh, you're gonna die.

636
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,900
Mmm!

637
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:14,400
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

638
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,367
This one goes with lettuce?

639
00:46:20,433 --> 00:46:22,066
Perilla leaves with bulgogi.

640
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,100
- Perilla leaves?
- Yes.

641
00:46:23,133 --> 00:46:25,467
- I'll help you.
- I can do it now.

642
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:27,266
It's over there.

643
00:46:27,333 --> 00:46:28,967
A sudden rush.

644
00:46:28,967 --> 00:46:30,800
It's dinner time, so…

645
00:46:30,867 --> 00:46:32,133
I think we'll hit 10,000.

646
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,166
Woo Shik.

647
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:48,767
Yes?

648
00:46:48,834 --> 00:46:50,500
- Three rice.
- Three.

649
00:46:50,567 --> 00:46:51,533
Here you go.

650
00:46:57,033 --> 00:46:58,967
- Fried tofu.
- Thank you.

651
00:47:00,734 --> 00:47:01,800
Which one was it?

652
00:47:03,667 --> 00:47:04,700
Tuna?

653
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,066
No. They're both for me.

654
00:47:08,133 --> 00:47:09,066
Oh.

655
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:11,367
I think yours isn't here yet.

656
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,734
It's good, right?

657
00:47:23,467 --> 00:47:25,333
Let me try some to cool the heat.

658
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,200
Try one.

659
00:47:30,834 --> 00:47:33,200
Yours is coming soon. Try mine until then.

660
00:47:33,266 --> 00:47:35,633
When we get yours, we can share it.

661
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:41,433
I hope this won't make you full.

662
00:47:41,467 --> 00:47:42,734
There's still more.

663
00:47:43,367 --> 00:47:44,400
It's good.

664
00:47:45,667 --> 00:47:46,567
Is it good?

665
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:50,066
It's a little sweet.

666
00:48:02,333 --> 00:48:04,867
Looks like she prefers this kind of rice.

667
00:48:06,166 --> 00:48:07,200
It's tasty.

668
00:48:16,066 --> 00:48:17,867
- Are they all served?
- Yes.

669
00:48:17,934 --> 00:48:18,900
Did we do ramyeon?

670
00:48:18,967 --> 00:48:20,400
Yes.

671
00:48:20,467 --> 00:48:21,567
They're all served.

672
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:23,900
Tater…

673
00:48:23,967 --> 00:48:25,433
Tater dogs?

674
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,500
Three tater dogs.

675
00:48:26,567 --> 00:48:27,567
That one's hard.

676
00:48:27,633 --> 00:48:29,367
Could you put them in the fryer?

677
00:48:29,433 --> 00:48:31,166
- I'll do the rest.
- Okay, got it.

678
00:48:31,233 --> 00:48:32,066
Thanks.

679
00:48:32,133 --> 00:48:33,934
Hurry with the bulgogi gimbap.

680
00:48:33,934 --> 00:48:36,200
But I'm making tuna first.

681
00:48:54,767 --> 00:48:56,567
- Yu Mi, tuna.
- Okay.

682
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,567
Just tuna for now, right?

683
00:48:58,633 --> 00:49:00,467
- Be as quick as you can.
- Shush.

684
00:49:30,967 --> 00:49:31,900
Okay.

685
00:49:51,166 --> 00:49:52,333
Hello.

686
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:03,033
Are you gonna eat it?

687
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,266
Don't say that. She would eat anything.

688
00:50:10,233 --> 00:50:11,667
It's mine.

689
00:50:14,867 --> 00:50:17,266
Does it have potatoes?

690
00:50:17,333 --> 00:50:19,500
Yes, it has potatoes.

691
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,333
How do you eat it though?

692
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,734
You have to open your mouth wide.

693
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:25,900
Right. It's quite heavy.

694
00:50:25,934 --> 00:50:27,400
Heavier than my future burdens.

695
00:50:34,266 --> 00:50:35,300
It's delicious.

696
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,033
I love how it's sweet and salty.

697
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:39,367
This one has both.

698
00:50:39,433 --> 00:50:40,467
It's good.

699
00:50:40,533 --> 00:50:42,133
I have to turn it now.

700
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,967
- So it's balanced.
- Huh?

701
00:50:44,033 --> 00:50:46,934
To balance it out,
I need to bite the other side now.

702
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:51,800
All right. Let's hurry.

703
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:54,533
Okay?

704
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,033
Gosh, please.

705
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,567
Come on.

706
00:50:57,633 --> 00:50:59,033
- Be quiet.
- Come on. Chop.

707
00:51:05,767 --> 00:51:06,834
The sesame seeds.

708
00:51:09,333 --> 00:51:10,333
Go.

709
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:13,834
Tuna for you.

710
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,533
Thank you.

711
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,667
If I eat one, will you eat one too?

712
00:51:19,734 --> 00:51:21,400
Why should I do that?

713
00:51:21,467 --> 00:51:24,900
Because I like seeing you eat.

714
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,900
Then I'll have two.

715
00:51:28,967 --> 00:51:30,900
Really?

716
00:51:30,967 --> 00:51:32,867
I was thinking
if I should eat more or not.

717
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,734
Can I have one more?

718
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,533
The tuna gimbap?

719
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:39,633
Will you eat it?

720
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:41,300
If you eat it, I will too.

721
00:51:41,367 --> 00:51:42,467
All right, then.

722
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,767
Do you like tuna gimbap better?

723
00:51:44,834 --> 00:51:45,834
Yes.

724
00:51:50,266 --> 00:51:51,467
It's tastier.

725
00:51:53,133 --> 00:51:54,133
It's good.

726
00:52:01,967 --> 00:52:02,967
Gosh.

727
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:18,767
It's starting to get really spicy.

728
00:52:18,834 --> 00:52:20,834
- Do you wanna try it?
- No.

729
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,300
- No?
- No.

730
00:52:26,934 --> 00:52:28,033
You sure that's enough?

731
00:52:28,033 --> 00:52:29,467
Yes, I'm very sure.

732
00:52:30,433 --> 00:52:31,734
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

733
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,667
This is getting a little hard for me.

734
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,900
You should slow down.

735
00:52:44,967 --> 00:52:46,133
It's tasty.

736
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,600
- Yeah?
- Yes.

737
00:53:03,033 --> 00:53:06,333
Look at this. Tater dog.

738
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:10,233
It's a corn dog with fries on it.

739
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:13,667
- Shouldn't we try that?
- Yes, we should.

740
00:53:13,734 --> 00:53:16,066
- We'll get the half & half one.
- Okay.

741
00:53:16,066 --> 00:53:17,166
We'll get ramyeon too.

742
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,533
- Are you ready to order?
- Yes.

743
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:20,767
One tater dog and…

744
00:53:22,266 --> 00:53:24,900
And one ramyeon too.

745
00:53:24,967 --> 00:53:27,900
We'd like to get
one half & half tater dog.

746
00:53:27,967 --> 00:53:30,734
- So, just three?
- Yes, just three.

747
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,867
Do you have fruit juice too?

748
00:53:32,934 --> 00:53:35,266
- Watermelon and pineapple.
- We'll get a watermelon juice.

749
00:53:35,367 --> 00:53:37,066
- One watermelon?
- Yes.

750
00:53:37,166 --> 00:53:38,233
I'll get white wine.

751
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,567
That's 470.

752
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:54,467
Is this you?

753
00:53:54,533 --> 00:53:55,367
Yes, that's me.

754
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:56,600
Cool.

755
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,700
We're suddenly getting lots of orders.

756
00:54:00,767 --> 00:54:02,500
An order.

757
00:54:02,567 --> 00:54:03,600
Okay.

758
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:28,734
This place is full.

759
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,333
There are two empty seats.

760
00:54:31,166 --> 00:54:32,333
The food must be good.

761
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,400
Should we sit here?

762
00:54:36,867 --> 00:54:37,834
Woo Shik.

763
00:54:40,867 --> 00:54:42,934
Hellamyeon…

764
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,233
I'm sure it'll be spicy.

765
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,300
Yeah.

766
00:54:47,633 --> 00:54:49,533
- I'll take this.
- Okay.

767
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:51,700
Look at this.

768
00:54:55,066 --> 00:54:59,100
This is chibap. It has chicken inside.

769
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:03,333
I'll take the chibap.

770
00:55:03,567 --> 00:55:05,834
- One chibap for you?
- Yes, please.

771
00:55:06,266 --> 00:55:08,367
I'll take the pineapple juice.

772
00:55:08,433 --> 00:55:09,934
- Make that two.
- Two pineapple juices?

773
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,867
Yes, thank you.

774
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,266
- It's 450.
- Okay.

775
00:55:14,734 --> 00:55:17,033
- Take this to your table.
- Oh, sweet.

776
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,967
I'm so excited.
Mine has lots of laver in it.

777
00:55:22,033 --> 00:55:24,000
I love laver.

778
00:55:24,066 --> 00:55:26,967
I like this kind of random encounter.

779
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:29,166
It feels special.

780
00:55:29,233 --> 00:55:31,467
It's cheap for something special though.

781
00:55:31,533 --> 00:55:34,233
Right. Even though it's so special.

782
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:40,000
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

783
00:55:41,433 --> 00:55:42,800
Do you have a straw?

784
00:55:42,867 --> 00:55:44,567
Yes.

785
00:55:44,633 --> 00:55:47,066
- Do you want a straw too?
- Yes, thank you.

786
00:55:47,834 --> 00:55:48,767
Here you go.

787
00:55:48,834 --> 00:55:49,834
Thank you.

788
00:55:57,767 --> 00:56:00,800
What? We're gonna be on TV.

789
00:56:00,867 --> 00:56:04,333
If you look so awkward,
you won't be on TV.

790
00:56:08,266 --> 00:56:10,200
Everyone here looks so chic.

791
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:11,300
Including us.

792
00:56:12,567 --> 00:56:17,834
At the end, they might say

793
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:20,633
that we're both weird.

794
00:56:24,433 --> 00:56:25,633
I'm done.

795
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:29,033
Let's order the chicken.

796
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:30,633
I want the chicken.

797
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,066
Go order it.

798
00:56:32,133 --> 00:56:33,633
Okay.

799
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:35,100
Can I get this one?

800
00:56:35,166 --> 00:56:37,233
The spicy fricken.

801
00:56:38,667 --> 00:56:39,967
Thank you.

802
00:56:40,033 --> 00:56:41,066
Thank you.

803
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:42,633
- An order.
- Yes.

804
00:56:42,700 --> 00:56:44,233
We got a chicken.

805
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,300
Okay.

806
00:56:51,066 --> 00:56:53,233
- Can you make ramyeon, Tae Hyung?
- Sure.

807
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:54,400
Thanks.

808
00:56:54,467 --> 00:56:55,800
You got this, Tae Hyung!

809
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,700
When my fans see this, they'll all cry.

810
00:57:00,767 --> 00:57:02,333
Seeing that this boy

811
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,600
who doesn't know anything
is trying to cook.

812
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:06,734
"Aww, he's all grown up now."

813
00:57:07,367 --> 00:57:10,333
Tae Hyung, you're not that good yet.

814
00:57:11,367 --> 00:57:12,233
No?

815
00:57:19,967 --> 00:57:21,033
It's boiling.

816
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:23,867
How did you know?

817
00:57:43,533 --> 00:57:44,867
I see. Like that.

818
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:47,300
Okay.

819
00:57:47,367 --> 00:57:50,800
Okay. One shake there and…

820
00:57:50,867 --> 00:57:52,734
- Okay.
- Do we have a bowl for chibap?

821
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:53,834
A bowl for chibap?

822
00:58:15,567 --> 00:58:18,500
I think we should try to sell
more rice menus.

823
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:20,033
- We can sell rice now?
- Yes.

824
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,567
Enough carrots there.

825
00:58:45,066 --> 00:58:46,433
I think ramyeon is done.

826
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,333
I wish I could have this.

827
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:00,400
Sorry, which table was this?
It's so confusing here.

828
00:59:00,467 --> 00:59:03,233
- One ramyeon and two corn dogs.
- Yes.

829
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:05,333
- For the black table. Hold on.
- Okay.

830
00:59:05,367 --> 00:59:06,166
Black.

831
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,266
- This is for black.
- Okay.

832
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:11,166
All of them?

833
00:59:11,233 --> 00:59:12,700
- All of them?
- All of them.

834
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,266
Oh, my goodness.

835
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:18,033
Slowly. Be careful.

836
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:19,633
Let me carry it.

837
00:59:19,667 --> 00:59:21,100
- Give it.
- Give her a corn dog.

838
00:59:21,133 --> 00:59:22,033
- Give me.
- Let go.

839
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,867
- Give me.
- Let go.

840
00:59:26,166 --> 00:59:27,133
The black table?

841
00:59:28,667 --> 00:59:30,100
Let's not be too sensitive.

842
00:59:30,166 --> 00:59:31,166
Smile.

843
00:59:32,100 --> 00:59:34,000
I was trying to help.

844
00:59:36,233 --> 00:59:38,800
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

845
00:59:38,967 --> 00:59:40,633
Ramyeon is for…

846
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,000
- We'll share it.
- Okay.

847
00:59:46,033 --> 00:59:47,233
Here you go.

848
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:49,367
Thank you.

849
00:59:51,633 --> 00:59:53,734
It's got sugar on it.

850
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:54,934
Sugar?

851
00:59:55,667 --> 00:59:57,433
Let's try it.

852
00:59:57,500 --> 00:59:58,800
Okay. Try it.

853
01:00:02,333 --> 01:00:05,200
It's not strange. It's tasty.

854
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:08,133
It's like a cheese doughnut.

855
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:11,533
It's good. The combination is so creative.

856
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,900
This could go well with some alcohol.

857
01:00:17,934 --> 01:00:20,166
I should ask for something spicy.

858
01:00:20,567 --> 01:00:21,800
It's too sweet for me.

859
01:00:25,033 --> 01:00:26,767
Do you have a spicy sauce?

860
01:00:26,800 --> 01:00:28,066
Yes, we do.

861
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,066
For what?

862
01:00:29,133 --> 01:00:30,633
- The corn dog?
- Yes.

863
01:00:30,700 --> 01:00:32,100
Give him some spicy sauce.

864
01:00:32,233 --> 01:00:33,266
- Spicy sauce?
- Yes.

865
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:36,867
- Here's the spicy sauce.
- Thank you.

866
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,633
It's like a dipping sauce?

867
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:40,934
Is it spicy or not spicy?

868
01:00:42,834 --> 01:00:44,767
It's like our Macha sauce.

869
01:00:48,066 --> 01:00:49,033
Oh.

870
01:00:52,000 --> 01:00:53,333
I love this sauce.

871
01:00:53,433 --> 01:00:55,033
I should ask for more.

872
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:56,400
To take it home?

873
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:57,834
"I'd like to have it to-go."

874
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,834
- Chibap, right?
- Yes.

875
01:01:23,600 --> 01:01:24,867
Nice. With kimchi.

876
01:01:24,934 --> 01:01:27,133
Oh, it's kimchi. Oh, my gosh.

877
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,033
Will I get some too?

878
01:01:29,934 --> 01:01:31,600
Here you go.

879
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,533
Enjoy, my friend.

880
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,133
The sauce tastes good.

881
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:43,900
- But…
- Is it a spicy sauce?

882
01:01:45,567 --> 01:01:48,166
The problem is
that I can't use chopsticks.

883
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:50,767
I should eat with my hands. Sorry.

884
01:01:56,033 --> 01:01:57,567
Do you like your food?

885
01:01:57,600 --> 01:01:58,533
Yes, it's tasty.

886
01:01:59,166 --> 01:02:00,967
That's great.

887
01:02:01,033 --> 01:02:02,800
It's sweet.

888
01:02:10,367 --> 01:02:12,467
I finished it all.

889
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:14,066
Can I take this away?

890
01:02:14,233 --> 01:02:15,300
Yes.

891
01:02:15,367 --> 01:02:16,934
It was very good. Thank you.

892
01:03:04,667 --> 01:03:05,767
I'm so full.

893
01:03:05,834 --> 01:03:08,166
- But we'll eat the chicken.
- I'll eat it.

894
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:12,533
I hope it's tasty.

895
01:03:13,133 --> 01:03:14,100
Here you go.

896
01:03:14,867 --> 01:03:16,066
Thank you.

897
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,433
Take a photo of me. With this too.

898
01:03:25,100 --> 01:03:26,667
Done?

899
01:03:26,734 --> 01:03:27,934
Is the magnet in it too?

900
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:30,233
- Is the magnet in it?
- No.

901
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:31,667
Take me another one.

902
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:44,367
I'm so excited.

903
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:54,433
It's so good. It's sweet and so flavorful.

904
01:03:55,433 --> 01:03:58,066
This was a very good idea.

905
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,533
I'm so glad we ordered it.

906
01:04:00,967 --> 01:04:03,100
I'm so full now,
but this was a good idea.

907
01:04:13,667 --> 01:04:15,367
You should take a break.

908
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,100
Order one more.

909
01:04:30,633 --> 01:04:32,567
Can I get one more sparkling water?

910
01:04:32,633 --> 01:04:34,166
Sparkling water.

911
01:04:41,266 --> 01:04:42,333
- Spicy?
- Yes.

912
01:04:43,367 --> 01:04:48,633
Are there even more spicy types
of ramyeon in Korea?

913
01:04:48,700 --> 01:04:49,600
Uhm…

914
01:04:49,667 --> 01:04:51,333
Or is this the spiciest?

915
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:53,567
I think this is the spiciest one.

916
01:04:53,633 --> 01:04:55,600
Yes, it was super good.

917
01:04:56,867 --> 01:04:58,266
Is this the spiciest one?

918
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:04,033
Do you need more ice?

919
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:06,000
No, I'm good.

920
01:05:06,066 --> 01:05:07,300
Thank you.

921
01:05:09,467 --> 01:05:10,500
Mmm.

922
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,066
I'm full now.

923
01:05:19,333 --> 01:05:20,400
The gimbap was nice.

924
01:05:21,734 --> 01:05:23,767
Yeah, that was really good.

925
01:05:23,834 --> 01:05:25,000
Look.

926
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:30,200
This sauce is a bit spicy.

927
01:05:30,266 --> 01:05:31,700
Yeah?

928
01:05:31,767 --> 01:05:34,033
Maybe it just tastes like cream to you.

929
01:05:35,734 --> 01:05:37,133
I barely taste anything.

930
01:05:38,266 --> 01:05:40,400
Your taste buds must be broken now.

931
01:05:46,533 --> 01:05:48,900
I don't think we hit 10,000 today.

932
01:05:48,967 --> 01:05:50,800
My guess is 9,400.

933
01:05:50,867 --> 01:05:52,834
We didn't sell many chickens.

934
01:05:52,900 --> 01:05:54,300
We sold lots of ramyeons.

935
01:06:06,333 --> 01:06:07,600
Hola.

936
01:06:07,633 --> 01:06:08,800
How many?

937
01:06:08,834 --> 01:06:10,133
One.

938
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:11,133
Are you two?

939
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:12,400
Two?

940
01:06:13,767 --> 01:06:16,100
We don't have tables now.
They need to wait.

941
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,800
- Is it okay if we separate the tables?
- Of course.

942
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,333
You'll have to wait a bit.

943
01:06:30,100 --> 01:06:31,633
You order there.

944
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:40,867
Hello.

945
01:06:40,934 --> 01:06:42,500
Hi, we're waiting now.

946
01:06:42,567 --> 01:06:44,133
Oh, there's a waiting line.

947
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,433
They're full.

948
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:50,266
I'm next.

949
01:06:50,333 --> 01:06:52,233
Right. Please go ahead.

950
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:03,500
Man.

951
01:07:03,567 --> 01:07:05,734
We have a huge waiting line.

952
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,233
Woo Shik, is the queue all under control?

953
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:18,700
- No.
- Could you go?

954
01:07:23,834 --> 01:07:25,200
How many are you?

955
01:07:25,266 --> 01:07:26,600
You guys came first, right?

956
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:28,066
Yes.

957
01:07:28,133 --> 01:07:29,500
You guys are first.

958
01:07:29,533 --> 01:07:30,834
And then next.

959
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:32,767
No, they're next.

960
01:07:32,834 --> 01:07:34,800
Oh, okay. So three of you.

961
01:07:35,333 --> 01:07:37,233
I think you'll have to wait…

962
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,867
For more than 20, 30 minutes.

963
01:07:48,567 --> 01:07:49,700
How many are waiting?

964
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:52,200
Three groups.

965
01:07:52,233 --> 01:07:53,467
They'll have to wait.

966
01:07:56,033 --> 01:07:58,433
That was a great meal.

967
01:07:58,500 --> 01:07:59,734
Shall we?

968
01:08:04,066 --> 01:08:06,133
Thank you.

969
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:09,367
Thank you very much. Thank you.

970
01:08:10,633 --> 01:08:11,834
Two, right?

971
01:08:14,033 --> 01:08:14,900
Hola.

972
01:08:17,734 --> 01:08:19,500
I saw something that looks delicious.

973
01:08:20,834 --> 01:08:22,233
Gim-bap.

974
01:08:22,300 --> 01:08:24,767
Gimbap.

975
01:08:24,834 --> 01:08:25,967
Hello.

976
01:08:26,033 --> 01:08:28,266
We'd like to get one tuna gimbap and…

977
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:29,333
One tuna?

978
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,800
- One of each.
- One each?

979
01:08:39,133 --> 01:08:40,367
Coke?

980
01:08:40,433 --> 01:08:42,100
I want Sprite.

981
01:08:42,166 --> 01:08:44,467
- Coke? Got it.
- Sprite.

982
01:08:46,133 --> 01:08:48,767
- Thank you. Please put this on your table.
- Thanks.

983
01:08:52,734 --> 01:08:54,633
Thank you.

984
01:08:56,266 --> 01:08:58,000
Okay, for two?

985
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:01,967
Oh, three? Ummm...

986
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:04,500
Are you okay with a small table?

987
01:09:04,567 --> 01:09:06,033
A small table?

988
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:07,200
If it fits, sure.

989
01:09:07,266 --> 01:09:08,200
Yes.

990
01:09:08,266 --> 01:09:09,433
Okay.

991
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,734
This way.

992
01:09:12,166 --> 01:09:14,500
Hello.

993
01:09:16,367 --> 01:09:18,400
Nice hair.

994
01:09:19,467 --> 01:09:21,266
Thanks!

995
01:09:22,433 --> 01:09:24,533
I'll get one ramyeon.

996
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,367
- And you?
- I'll get the same one.

997
01:09:26,433 --> 01:09:27,767
Two?

998
01:09:27,834 --> 01:09:29,400
No, three please.

999
01:09:29,467 --> 01:09:31,066
A friend will join later.

1000
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,166
- Oh, okay. So three.
- Yes.

1001
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:37,066
Could you serve the third one
when our friend comes?

1002
01:09:37,133 --> 01:09:38,867
It'll take some time to cook too.

1003
01:09:38,867 --> 01:09:40,633
Oh, perfect. Thank you.

1004
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:45,300
Can we pay for just two now
and pay for the third one later?

1005
01:09:45,367 --> 01:09:46,667
Okay, sure.

1006
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:54,834
- One half-and-half corn dog?
- Yes.

1007
01:09:54,967 --> 01:09:56,467
What did you order?

1008
01:09:56,533 --> 01:09:59,133
The one with the cheese.

1009
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:02,066
She's full. She won't eat anymore.

1010
01:10:02,133 --> 01:10:03,834
But I'm not.

1011
01:10:03,900 --> 01:10:06,000
It's for me.

1012
01:10:07,433 --> 01:10:08,867
An order.

1013
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:11,166
- We got three ramyeon orders.
- Okay.

1014
01:10:11,233 --> 01:10:13,934
But cook only two now
and cook the third one later.

1015
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,633
- Why?
- Their friend is coming late.

1016
01:10:17,834 --> 01:10:18,800
Okay.

1017
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,967
- What is it?
- Spicy pork and tuna.

1018
01:10:21,033 --> 01:10:22,000
Spicy pork gimbap?

1019
01:10:22,066 --> 01:10:23,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

1020
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,000
We're out of laver now.

1021
01:10:26,066 --> 01:10:28,133
We can still make a couple more, right?

1022
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:29,900
No, just one.

1023
01:10:31,834 --> 01:10:32,900
We have plenty.

1024
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:35,033
This… Oh, we're running out of this too.

1025
01:10:35,066 --> 01:10:36,533
Cut it when we get an order.

1026
01:10:36,533 --> 01:10:37,900
- Okay.
- When we get an order.

1027
01:11:08,467 --> 01:11:10,667
Could you get me two plates for gimbap?

1028
01:11:10,734 --> 01:11:12,500
- Two plates for gimbap.
- Yes.

1029
01:11:16,934 --> 01:11:19,834
Could you wash two plates
for gimbap first?

1030
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:21,633
- Plates for gimbap.
- Two of these.

1031
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:23,166
- Keep it up.
- Keep it up.

1032
01:11:23,233 --> 01:11:25,433
- Happy face.
- Happy face.

1033
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:27,300
- Can I wash this once?
- Sure.

1034
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:29,834
- Okay.
- Okay.

1035
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:31,734
Mucho muy bien.

1036
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:34,967
Take the gimbap plate!

1037
01:11:41,834 --> 01:11:43,867
Woo Shik, gimbap is ready.

1038
01:11:45,133 --> 01:11:46,233
Tuna?

1039
01:11:46,900 --> 01:11:49,200
Yes, Thank you.

1040
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:52,633
Let's exchange one piece each.

1041
01:11:52,700 --> 01:11:53,800
Okay.

1042
01:11:53,867 --> 01:11:55,000
How will you eat it?

1043
01:11:55,066 --> 01:11:57,000
- Just like this?
- All at once?

1044
01:12:00,333 --> 01:12:02,800
Remember.
You have to eat the whole piece at once.

1045
01:12:02,867 --> 01:12:04,000
All right.

1046
01:12:04,066 --> 01:12:05,166
Try it.

1047
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,200
Mmm.

1048
01:12:12,567 --> 01:12:13,700
Mmm!

1049
01:12:16,033 --> 01:12:17,233
It's so good.

1050
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,000
It's delicious.

1051
01:12:21,266 --> 01:12:22,533
It's good.

1052
01:12:22,600 --> 01:12:24,633
It's really good.

1053
01:12:25,567 --> 01:12:29,066
Hey, our teamwork is incredible now.

1054
01:13:00,567 --> 01:13:02,500
Should I turn off the heat?

1055
01:13:02,567 --> 01:13:03,900
Yeah, turn it off.

1056
01:13:22,367 --> 01:13:24,700
Could you play
"Run with Me" by SUNWOOJUNGA?

1057
01:13:26,100 --> 01:13:27,400
That's a perfect song.

1058
01:13:44,567 --> 01:13:46,000
Let's leave

1059
01:13:48,967 --> 01:13:52,667
Leave all the worries behind

1060
01:13:56,166 --> 01:13:59,834
Instead, we’ll pack light

1061
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:03,433
Leave the tongs behind

1062
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:06,133
Jinny's Hell.

1063
01:14:06,300 --> 01:14:08,467
I feel like I'm being fried.

1064
01:14:08,533 --> 01:14:10,133
I'm quitting.

1065
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:16,834
I'll be with you

1066
01:14:17,066 --> 01:14:19,233
on your side

1067
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:24,367
I’ll hold your hand if you reach out

1068
01:14:27,633 --> 01:14:31,000
Would there be anything to fear of

1069
01:14:34,533 --> 01:14:36,000
Run away with me

1070
01:14:36,233 --> 01:14:38,033
- Cheer up. We got this.
- We got this.

1071
01:14:40,567 --> 01:14:42,133
He's running late.

1072
01:14:52,533 --> 01:14:53,934
Oh, okay.

1073
01:14:54,300 --> 01:14:56,000
That's 100 pesos.

1074
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:59,100
- Yes.
- Okay, thank you.

1075
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:03,233
The rest of the ramyeon customers came.
You can make all three.

1076
01:15:03,433 --> 01:15:05,800
Tell me

1077
01:15:06,633 --> 01:15:11,233
I’ll be with you

1078
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:13,467
On your side

1079
01:15:14,033 --> 01:15:19,467
I’ll hold your hand if you reach out

1080
01:15:21,867 --> 01:15:25,467
Would there be anything to fear of

1081
01:15:25,734 --> 01:15:29,667
Wherever we go

1082
01:15:30,100 --> 01:15:37,266
We’ll hold onto eachother tightly

1083
01:15:38,233 --> 01:15:39,133
For the purple.

1084
01:15:39,867 --> 01:15:43,266
Run away with me

1085
01:15:51,400 --> 01:15:53,400
Right? The sausage was good.

1086
01:15:53,467 --> 01:15:56,734
I like the sweet and salty combination.

1087
01:16:08,367 --> 01:16:09,200
Three?

1088
01:16:09,266 --> 01:16:10,166
Yes, three.

1089
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:14,900
The table is too small.
Could you wait a little?

1090
01:16:15,967 --> 01:16:17,066
Are you guys done?

1091
01:16:17,133 --> 01:16:18,834
- Yes.
- Okay. Thank you very much.

1092
01:16:18,900 --> 01:16:20,633
I'll clean this up.

1093
01:16:20,700 --> 01:16:22,900
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

1094
01:16:41,667 --> 01:16:42,500
What do you want?

1095
01:16:42,567 --> 01:16:43,633
What do you want?

1096
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:45,533
I'm thinking…

1097
01:16:46,033 --> 01:16:48,333
Either this or this.

1098
01:16:48,934 --> 01:16:50,066
What do you want?

1099
01:16:50,133 --> 01:16:52,000
Well, I…

1100
01:16:52,066 --> 01:16:53,100
One of these.

1101
01:16:56,767 --> 01:16:59,300
I'd like to order…

1102
01:17:00,767 --> 01:17:03,333
Bulgogi gimbap.

1103
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,433
One bulgogi gimbap, okay.

1104
01:17:05,500 --> 01:17:06,934
For drink?

1105
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,567
What do you have?

1106
01:17:08,633 --> 01:17:09,667
Here.

1107
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,066
Pineapple juice, please.

1108
01:17:13,133 --> 01:17:15,133
- Pineapple juice?
- Yes, please.

1109
01:17:18,667 --> 01:17:19,633
How much is it?

1110
01:17:19,767 --> 01:17:21,133
That would be 210 pesos.

1111
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:22,367
Okay.

1112
01:17:22,433 --> 01:17:23,767
Bulgogi. Should I put it up?

1113
01:17:23,767 --> 01:17:24,900
- One?
- Yes.

1114
01:17:32,133 --> 01:17:33,500
One corn dog, please.

1115
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,467
One classic corn dog? Got it.

1116
01:17:35,533 --> 01:17:37,233
And…

1117
01:17:37,300 --> 01:17:41,066
I'm thinking either this or this.

1118
01:17:41,867 --> 01:17:43,633
This one is right here.

1119
01:17:45,066 --> 01:17:46,533
It has both meat and rice.

1120
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:47,700
Oh, that one.

1121
01:17:47,767 --> 01:17:49,734
- I'll do that one.
- This one?

1122
01:17:50,233 --> 01:17:51,100
A Coke.

1123
01:17:51,166 --> 01:17:51,967
Okay.

1124
01:17:52,033 --> 01:17:54,367
And for the kid,
one pineapple juice, please.

1125
01:17:54,433 --> 01:17:56,734
- So one Coke and pineapple juice?
- Yes.

1126
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:58,300
Is that it?

1127
01:17:58,367 --> 01:17:59,600
That's it.

1128
01:18:36,033 --> 01:18:37,400
Thank you.

1129
01:18:37,467 --> 01:18:39,000
It's all Korean food, right?

1130
01:18:39,066 --> 01:18:40,400
Yes.

1131
01:18:53,934 --> 01:18:55,800
It's pretty spicy.

1132
01:18:55,867 --> 01:18:58,433
- Is it spicy?
- Yes, for me.

1133
01:19:11,467 --> 01:19:12,967
I'll just eat it. It's good.

1134
01:19:14,133 --> 01:19:16,834
They might be famous people.

1135
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:18,133
In Korea.

1136
01:19:18,967 --> 01:19:21,033
I heard there's BTS here.

1137
01:19:21,100 --> 01:19:22,467
One of them is BTS.

1138
01:19:23,066 --> 01:19:24,100
What's the name again?

1139
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,100
BTS.

1140
01:19:26,700 --> 01:19:28,600
Chef, you can count on me.

1141
01:19:30,467 --> 01:19:31,700
I'll show you I can do it.

1142
01:19:35,533 --> 01:19:37,300
Good luck then.

1143
01:19:37,367 --> 01:19:38,834
I won't let you down.

1144
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:44,867
No, no.

1145
01:19:44,934 --> 01:19:46,333
Your flicks are too rough.

1146
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:47,467
Spin it more gently.

1147
01:19:48,500 --> 01:19:50,100
Breadcrumb it first.

1148
01:19:56,667 --> 01:19:58,600
I'll make one extra just in case.

1149
01:20:19,834 --> 01:20:21,367
You can't go back like this.

1150
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:22,533
Yes, I can.

1151
01:20:26,333 --> 01:20:27,467
Just in case…

1152
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:47,834
It's easy.

1153
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:49,400
We don't know the result yet.

1154
01:20:50,166 --> 01:20:51,166
Let's see the result.

1155
01:21:07,834 --> 01:21:10,734
- You see the water coming out?
- Yes.

1156
01:21:10,767 --> 01:21:12,767
When the meat is cooked, boil it down.

1157
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:15,333
- Okay.
- Until the broth goes away.

1158
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:16,567
Okay.

1159
01:21:19,633 --> 01:21:21,333
- Did we hit 10,000?
- I don't know.

1160
01:21:21,400 --> 01:21:22,667
I doubt it.

1161
01:21:22,734 --> 01:21:25,567
We got too many ramyeon orders today.

1162
01:21:36,934 --> 01:21:38,867
You're not flipping two at once, right?

1163
01:21:38,934 --> 01:21:41,100
No, I'm not. That would be terrible.

1164
01:21:42,533 --> 01:21:44,033
I'll double-check everything.

1165
01:22:13,033 --> 01:22:14,400
Let's go.

1166
01:22:14,467 --> 01:22:16,400
Oh, that's a big one.

1167
01:22:16,467 --> 01:22:18,033
That's a big one.

1168
01:22:19,633 --> 01:22:21,133
We did it. I'm sure of it.

1169
01:22:30,200 --> 01:22:31,233
Please.

1170
01:22:46,266 --> 01:22:47,934
Let's get one more group.

1171
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,033
We need one more. Goodness.

1172
01:23:04,166 --> 01:23:05,834
- What's up?
- Just one more group.

1173
01:23:05,834 --> 01:23:07,633
Really? How much did we make?

1174
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:09,600
- 11,250.
- 11,250.

1175
01:23:09,667 --> 01:23:10,567
Really?

1176
01:23:10,633 --> 01:23:12,166
Should we get one more group?

1177
01:23:15,800 --> 01:23:16,667
Darn it.

1178
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:31,333
We should order there and pay.

1179
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:54,133
For the purple table?

1180
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,533
- Gray.
- Over there.

1181
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,767
- Gray.
- No, that one over there.

1182
01:23:57,834 --> 01:23:59,133
- Who?
- Where she came from.

1183
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:00,834
- I don't know.
- Isn't that purple?

1184
01:24:02,033 --> 01:24:03,400
It's purple.

1185
01:24:07,333 --> 01:24:09,033
One Sprite and two Cokes please.

1186
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:11,400
One Sprite and two Cokes?

1187
01:24:17,900 --> 01:24:18,934
Okay.

1188
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:24,200
Gracias.

1189
01:24:33,734 --> 01:24:34,767
Hey, wait.

1190
01:24:36,367 --> 01:24:37,900
Seo Jun, you didn't add this.

1191
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:39,367
- What?
- You didn't add this.

1192
01:24:40,500 --> 01:24:41,600
We didn't add this up.

1193
01:24:43,367 --> 01:24:44,266
Oh.

1194
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:50,567
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1195
01:25:10,367 --> 01:25:12,467
Oh, that one group.

1196
01:25:15,433 --> 01:25:17,000
If we say our kitchen is closing,

1197
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,033
- they'll order.
- "Who wants to order more?"

1198
01:25:19,100 --> 01:25:20,867
I don't think that's likely.

1199
01:25:21,266 --> 01:25:23,800
- Only the drinks…
- How much more do we need?

1200
01:25:24,867 --> 01:25:26,266
Gosh, just one team.

1201
01:26:40,133 --> 01:26:42,500
We don't know the result yet.

1202
01:26:42,567 --> 01:26:43,667
Let's see the result.

1203
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,300
I'm actually tearing up.

1204
01:27:15,133 --> 01:27:16,867
Why is his so perfect?

1205
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,200
His is different.

1206
01:27:29,100 --> 01:27:32,333
Seriously, Park Seo Jun is so perfect.

1207
01:27:49,967 --> 01:27:51,533
We're only one corn dog away.

1208
01:27:53,633 --> 01:27:54,500
Just one corn dog.

1209
01:27:54,567 --> 01:27:56,166
We're taking last orders now.

1210
01:27:56,166 --> 01:27:58,166
Do you need anything?

1211
01:27:58,233 --> 01:27:59,367
Corn dogs or…

1212
01:28:01,700 --> 01:28:04,834
Do you guys want anything? Corn dogs...

1213
01:28:04,934 --> 01:28:07,133
Well… Do you want to order anything?

1214
01:28:07,200 --> 01:28:08,500
- No.
- No, it's okay.

1215
01:28:08,567 --> 01:28:09,667
Okay.

1216
01:28:11,033 --> 01:28:12,266
Okay.

1217
01:28:29,633 --> 01:28:32,734
We're taking last orders.
Do you want anything? Corn dogs?

1218
01:28:38,433 --> 01:28:39,734
Not for the moment.

1219
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:41,667
¿Tiene servicio para llevar?

1220
01:28:45,800 --> 01:28:47,667
¿Tiene servicio para llevar?

1221
01:28:47,734 --> 01:28:48,633
¿Para llevar?

1222
01:28:48,700 --> 01:28:50,200
Takeout? Takeaway?

1223
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,266
- Takeaway?
- Yes.

1224
01:28:52,333 --> 01:28:54,166
Yes, of course.

1225
01:28:56,166 --> 01:28:56,967
This is great.

1226
01:28:57,533 --> 01:28:58,433
- Did it work?
- Yes.

1227
01:28:58,433 --> 01:28:59,500
- To-go?
- Yes.

1228
01:29:01,333 --> 01:29:03,300
Please order now. The kitchen's closing.

1229
01:29:03,367 --> 01:29:04,300
I'm coming.

1230
01:29:04,967 --> 01:29:06,734
Anything from here.

1231
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:08,200
Not these.

1232
01:29:08,266 --> 01:29:09,834
This and this one.

1233
01:29:09,900 --> 01:29:11,200
Oh, okay.

1234
01:29:11,266 --> 01:29:12,800
You can order this too.

1235
01:29:37,333 --> 01:29:38,367
Can I order this?

1236
01:29:40,200 --> 01:29:41,133
Spicy pork.

1237
01:29:41,166 --> 01:29:42,700
Can we do a spicy pork gimbap?

1238
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:43,400
Yes.

1239
01:29:43,467 --> 01:29:44,467
Yes.

1240
01:29:45,166 --> 01:29:46,567
I'll get that one to-go.

1241
01:29:46,633 --> 01:29:48,233
- One to-go.
- Okay.

1242
01:29:59,867 --> 01:30:03,500
Let's go for 12,000, 12,000, 12,000!

1243
01:30:03,567 --> 01:30:05,300
We did it.

1244
01:30:05,367 --> 01:30:06,333
What did they order?

1245
01:30:06,367 --> 01:30:07,500
Spicy pork gimbap.

1246
01:30:07,567 --> 01:30:08,700
Nice.

1247
01:30:08,767 --> 01:30:09,633
Yay!

1248
01:30:09,700 --> 01:30:10,567
Spicy pork gimbap.

1249
01:30:10,633 --> 01:30:11,967
We hit 12,000.

1250
01:30:12,033 --> 01:30:13,166
Gosh.

1251
01:30:14,133 --> 01:30:16,166
- How dramatic.
- So dramatic.

1252
01:30:16,233 --> 01:30:18,066
What a drama.

1253
01:30:19,934 --> 01:30:21,066
Thank you.

1254
01:30:30,066 --> 01:30:31,400
Can I take one?

1255
01:30:34,367 --> 01:30:37,633
Thank you very much. Thanks.

1256
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:45,500
Gosh, you're dimples look so happy again.

1257
01:30:52,233 --> 01:30:54,500
What kind of face is that?

1258
01:30:54,567 --> 01:30:58,100
Goodness. Jinny is unbelievable.

1259
01:30:58,166 --> 01:31:01,033
I can't believe we did it.

1260
01:31:01,100 --> 01:31:02,834
We made it.

1261
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,800
The last to-go order at the end…

1262
01:31:08,467 --> 01:31:09,867
Woo Shik made it happen.

1263
01:31:13,100 --> 01:31:15,133
Woo Shik is such a good promoter.

1264
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:18,867
If we got that one group,
we would've hit the goal more easily.

1265
01:31:18,934 --> 01:31:20,133
It's okay.

1266
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:21,500
Oh, that one group.

1267
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:25,200
That was so funny.

1268
01:31:25,734 --> 01:31:26,834
What?

1269
01:31:36,533 --> 01:31:37,834
Last sesame seeds.

1270
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:39,300
- Great job.
- Thanks.

1271
01:31:55,900 --> 01:31:57,066
Gracias.

1272
01:32:00,500 --> 01:32:01,834
Thank you.

1273
01:32:09,266 --> 01:32:10,867
Adiós.

1274
01:32:10,934 --> 01:32:13,233
Send him a kiss.

1275
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:14,333
Adiós.

1276
01:32:19,633 --> 01:32:21,834
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1277
01:32:21,867 --> 01:32:24,367
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1278
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:26,734
- Bye.
- Good night.

1279
01:32:26,934 --> 01:32:29,700
It's over, Tae Hyung.

1280
01:32:29,767 --> 01:32:30,834
You did a great job.

1281
01:32:38,934 --> 01:32:40,033
- Great work.
- Well done.

1282
01:32:40,033 --> 01:32:41,200
- Good work.
- Well done.

1283
01:32:41,266 --> 01:32:42,600
We hit 12,000.

1284
01:32:43,266 --> 01:32:44,233
It's 12,070.

1285
01:32:52,700 --> 01:32:54,100
Open!

1286
01:32:55,233 --> 01:32:56,400
I'll open now.

1287
01:33:11,467 --> 01:33:13,834
I wonder what will happen today.

1288
01:33:24,233 --> 01:33:25,767
Sorry. So sorry.

1289
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,433
- Good work, guys.
- Good work.

1290
01:33:47,867 --> 01:33:49,166
If we hadn't made 12,000,

1291
01:33:49,166 --> 01:33:51,233
we would've had to walk
on eggshells again.

1292
01:33:51,266 --> 01:33:52,834
I was going to resign.

1293
01:33:53,967 --> 01:33:54,867
Seriously.

1294
01:33:54,934 --> 01:33:57,033
I was going to resign today.

1295
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:02,567
Shouldn't we do this? To celebrate 12,000?

1296
01:34:02,633 --> 01:34:04,333
I seriously wanted to resign.

1297
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,633
Let's do this just once.

1298
01:34:06,700 --> 01:34:07,900
A 12,000 celebration?

1299
01:34:07,967 --> 01:34:08,934
Yes, let's do that.

1300
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:10,734
Everyone, stand here.

1301
01:34:13,767 --> 01:34:14,967
Are you guys zero?

1302
01:34:15,033 --> 01:34:16,166
- And I'm one?
- Yes.

1303
01:34:16,233 --> 01:34:17,533
So 12,000?

1304
01:34:20,800 --> 01:34:23,867
- I should do this.
- It's 12,000.

1305
01:34:26,834 --> 01:34:27,900
Are you doing it?

1306
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:34,233
Good. Good job, everyone.

1307
01:34:34,300 --> 01:34:35,867
Good work, guys.

1308
01:34:38,600 --> 01:34:41,400
- One last slate before we go.
- Okay.

1309
01:34:41,467 --> 01:34:42,467
All right.

1310
01:34:42,533 --> 01:34:44,333
One, two, three.

1311
01:34:45,433 --> 01:34:48,133
Wait. Seo Jin didn't do it.

1312
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:49,300
I don't do such things.

1313
01:34:49,300 --> 01:34:51,467
Seo Jin didn't do it.

1314
01:34:51,533 --> 01:34:54,066
Seo Jin is doing it this time. Come on.

1315
01:34:54,133 --> 01:34:56,133
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1316
01:35:02,266 --> 01:35:04,500
My dream is to become a singer!

1317
01:35:12,400 --> 01:35:14,000
- Not yet.
- No?

1318
01:35:14,066 --> 01:35:15,066
I'm not starting yet.

1319
01:35:16,066 --> 01:35:17,233
Perro, move.

1320
01:35:17,300 --> 01:35:18,834
- Move, buddy.
- Hey, move over.

1321
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:45,533
Let's go home now.

1322
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:56,600
We're gonna ask you the questions

1323
01:35:56,667 --> 01:35:59,066
that the viewers want to ask you.

1324
01:36:00,166 --> 01:36:02,333
Why did you open the restaurant at 2 PM?

1325
01:36:02,600 --> 01:36:05,333
Which was harder?
Front kitchen or back kitchen?

1326
01:36:05,400 --> 01:36:07,467
Did you curse inside or not?

1327
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:09,600
Excuse me,
but are we here for clarification?

1328
01:36:12,433 --> 01:36:15,033
What's aired is not even one third
of what we did.

1329
01:36:15,100 --> 01:36:16,533
Their argument over ramyeon.

1330
01:36:16,567 --> 01:36:18,700
- That was funny, but it's all cut out.
- Right.

1331
01:36:20,734 --> 01:36:22,467
If all of that is aired,

1332
01:36:22,533 --> 01:36:24,467
people will know why I'm laughing now.

1333
01:36:24,533 --> 01:36:27,700
I was really surprised.
I understand it had to be cut out

1334
01:36:27,767 --> 01:36:29,867
because of airtime though.

1335
01:36:29,867 --> 01:36:31,934
It's just us.
I had to shove him around.

1336
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:36,867
I spent my six years of life here.

1337
01:36:36,934 --> 01:36:39,867
Who else would I entrust with the kitchen?

1338
01:36:39,934 --> 01:36:41,500
You didn't say I was slow.

1339
01:36:41,567 --> 01:36:43,567
What do we do now?

1340
01:36:43,633 --> 01:36:44,633
What do we do?

1341
01:36:44,700 --> 01:36:46,533
We'll be back right after this!

1342
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,367
Over there.

1343
01:36:50,433 --> 01:36:51,867
Gosh, so interesting.

1344
01:36:53,033 --> 01:36:55,900
Why are you standing? Sit down.

1345
01:36:55,967 --> 01:36:58,233
- You wanted more.
- I will, before going to bed.

1346
01:36:58,300 --> 01:37:00,967
- Eat it. I'll wash it.
- I need to digest the food.

1347
01:37:01,033 --> 01:37:02,700
Don't give it to me.

1348
01:37:03,433 --> 01:37:05,800
I'll put it next to you
while you're asleep.

1349
01:37:06,667 --> 01:37:09,767
- Bacalar.
- The best city I've ever been.

1350
01:37:09,834 --> 01:37:11,367
This atmosphere overwhelms me.

1351
01:37:11,433 --> 01:37:13,100
The people who like you

1352
01:37:13,166 --> 01:37:15,467
will like the new sides of you.

1353
01:37:15,533 --> 01:37:17,967
This will be a precious asset for you.

1354
01:37:18,033 --> 01:37:19,967
There's nothing to worry about.

1355
01:37:22,300 --> 01:37:23,467
- Okay.
- Sounds good.

1356
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,433
It's so easy to say "Okay."

1357
01:37:31,533 --> 01:37:33,667
Did he use it?

1358
01:37:33,734 --> 01:37:34,834
He used English.

1359
01:38:16,567 --> 01:38:19,500
