00:00:22,467 --> 00:00:25,934
JINNY'S KITCHEN

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,333
- We're opening now.
- Open.

3
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,400
I wonder what's gonna happen today.

4
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:35,700
Thank you. Bye.

5
00:00:35,767 --> 00:00:36,867
12,070.

6
00:00:38,667 --> 00:00:39,867
How dramatic.

7
00:00:39,934 --> 00:00:41,767
What a drama.

8
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:44,233
Seriously, I was going to resign.

9
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:47,266
12,000!

10
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,867
- Good work.
- Good work, guys.

11
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:56,667
Finally, the star has arrived.

12
00:00:56,734 --> 00:00:59,200
The CEO of Jinny's Kitchen.

13
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:00,533
I'm just an owner.

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,633
An owner slash CEO.

15
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,133
Jinny's Kitchen

16
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:08,233
just ended its 8 days of business

17
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,900
and closed now.

18
00:01:09,967 --> 00:01:11,667
Well, temporarily.

19
00:01:11,734 --> 00:01:13,633
What did you like and dislike

20
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,000
during the past ten days of working?

21
00:01:16,066 --> 00:01:17,166
Share one each.

22
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:19,934
Well, what I liked was

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,700
that we reached our goals.

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,333
We hit 12,000 on the last day.

25
00:01:28,934 --> 00:01:31,533
That's probably my biggest achievement.

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,200
What I disliked...

27
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:36,333
On some days,

28
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,600
the sales were not high enough.

29
00:01:38,667 --> 00:01:40,734
I didn't like that.

30
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,600
If we had worked harder,
we would've earned more.

31
00:01:43,633 --> 00:01:46,633
I can't get my employees to work
the way I want.

32
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:50,667
I think the experienced ones

33
00:01:50,734 --> 00:01:53,800
like Executive Director Jung
and Senior Manager Park

34
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:55,667
didn't complain too much.

35
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:57,166
Because they did it before.

36
00:01:57,233 --> 00:01:58,900
But the interns…

37
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:01,867
They made quite some trouble.

38
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:04,133
You know, they say

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,000
one rotten apple spoils the barrel.

40
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:08,533
They provoked other employees.

41
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:10,033
That was quite problematic.

42
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:13,266
While working,

43
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:16,233
what did you like and dislike?

44
00:02:16,233 --> 00:02:18,233
I wanted to at least ask you that.

45
00:02:18,266 --> 00:02:19,300
What I disliked?

46
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,000
First, what did you like?

47
00:02:22,066 --> 00:02:24,166
I was working in the dining area,

48
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:27,033
juggling multiple tables at once.

49
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,333
You were in the dining area
for at least five hours.

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,500
So as Seo Jin said,

51
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:34,467
I was pretty nervous.

52
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:36,834
This tension kept me on my toes.

53
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,734
Which I found actually quite fun.

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,533
But before, you said it was hard.

55
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,734
It was hard.

56
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,834
But I liked it as much as I hated it.

57
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,500
Staying on your toes?

58
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,367
Yes.

59
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:51,567
It was really hard, but also really fun.

60
00:02:51,633 --> 00:02:55,066
Regarding the relationship
with other staff members,

61
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,500
what were you happy and unhappy about?

62
00:02:57,567 --> 00:03:00,300
To be honest…

63
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:04,400
I was working with my friends, right?

64
00:03:04,467 --> 00:03:07,734
But at some point,
they weren't my friends but my bosses.

65
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:10,867
They were higher in status than me.

66
00:03:10,934 --> 00:03:12,867
That was quite new.

67
00:03:12,934 --> 00:03:15,367
At some point, Tae Hyung told me to say

68
00:03:15,433 --> 00:03:17,533
"Yes, sir" when I answer him,

69
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,266
and it really hit me hard.

70
00:03:21,333 --> 00:03:26,467
He turned out to be good at it.
Keeping relationships, I mean.

71
00:03:26,533 --> 00:03:28,800
He's really good at relationship stuff.

72
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:30,433
The orders, you know.

73
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,133
He's really good at it.

74
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,300
It was like running a restaurant

75
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:38,300
with nice friends
that I felt comfortable around.

76
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:39,934
I really loved it.

77
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,300
You seemed to have misunderstood
the purpose of the show at first.

78
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,066
You thought it was for travel.

79
00:03:46,066 --> 00:03:48,800
On the first day,
I didn't have much thought,

80
00:03:48,867 --> 00:03:52,100
but once we started working,

81
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,066
I felt something was off.

82
00:03:54,133 --> 00:03:56,400
For the first two days,

83
00:03:56,467 --> 00:03:58,266
I tried not to think too much of it.

84
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,300
Then since the third day,

85
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:03,133
I started to feel confused.

86
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,033
When I heard

87
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,834
the boss would be deciding everything.

88
00:04:09,066 --> 00:04:10,100
I felt stuck since.

89
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,100
Still, I did my best

90
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,600
to enjoy myself here.

91
00:04:17,266 --> 00:04:18,133
I see.

92
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,800
We're finally done working.

93
00:04:20,867 --> 00:04:23,667
What I liked was

94
00:04:23,734 --> 00:04:25,834
that my main job…

95
00:04:27,266 --> 00:04:28,900
Wait. What was my main job?

96
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,033
What I liked was

97
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:36,700
being able to spend good times
with good people.

98
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:38,867
That's what I liked most.

99
00:04:38,934 --> 00:04:41,266
What I disliked was…

100
00:04:41,333 --> 00:04:43,500
Well, I kept feeling like

101
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:45,667
I was in the army.

102
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:49,166
It felt like I was in the military.

103
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,867
What do they have in common?

104
00:04:51,934 --> 00:04:53,400
First off,

105
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:56,967
we had a fixed wake-up time.

106
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:59,900
We had to walk on eggshells
around the boss.

107
00:05:01,767 --> 00:05:03,033
The dress regulations.

108
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,967
The uniforms. Gosh…

109
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:08,934
So you were reminded
of when you were enlisted.

110
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,233
Yes.

111
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,667
If I had to pick a con,
that would be it.

112
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:15,700
- But I didn't have any.
- All right.

113
00:05:15,767 --> 00:05:18,000
Since it's a workplace,

114
00:05:18,033 --> 00:05:19,667
- Un poco.
- you had rules.

115
00:05:19,667 --> 00:05:21,533
Which made you un poco uncomfortable,

116
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:24,200
- but mostly, you had mucho fun.
- It was mucho fun.

117
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,266
Muchas fun.

118
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,967
You've worked for ten days.

119
00:05:27,033 --> 00:05:29,033
What did you like most?

120
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,533
To be honest,

121
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,934
Seo Jin said
Jinny's Kitchen would be really easy.

122
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,433
But I'm not sure
which part he was referring to.

123
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,233
You need to think hard on that.

124
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,533
It was not easy at all.

125
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,300
Seo Jin once said he hated moody people.

126
00:05:43,367 --> 00:05:46,033
But he was a bit…

127
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,800
It would've been nicer if he tried to be

128
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:50,667
less moody.

129
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:53,367
I see. And what did you like?

130
00:05:53,433 --> 00:05:57,233
Thanks to my colleagues, I laughed a lot.

131
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,800
I think I got
at least three wrinkles here.

132
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:03,600
But they're good wrinkles.

133
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:05,734
Even though you got some wrinkles,

134
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,166
you're proud of them.

135
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:08,734
I'm so proud of them.

136
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,266
Let's wrap it up here then.

137
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:21,433
Oh, hello.

138
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:24,633
Look at you, all dressed up.

139
00:06:24,633 --> 00:06:26,066
What are we doing?

140
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:28,367
Did you know work involves company events?

141
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:32,200
I haven't worked for companies, so…

142
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,567
The boss said he'd like the interns
to come early and get ready.

143
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:37,767
In fact, he even picked the menus himself.

144
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:39,400
- Okay.
- Well, kids love food

145
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,500
- like pizza
- Pizza?

146
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:43,533
- and pasta.
- Got it.

147
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,100
So since this is a wrap party,

148
00:06:45,133 --> 00:06:46,800
you respect their tastes.

149
00:06:46,834 --> 00:06:48,800
With the menus and all.

150
00:06:50,266 --> 00:06:53,200
I'm not respecting anything.

151
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:55,400
I want something like
an eel rice bowl.

152
00:06:55,467 --> 00:06:57,266
Eel rice bowls?

153
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,767
So pizza and pasta--

154
00:06:59,834 --> 00:07:01,834
Like an aerodrome lounge.

155
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,400
Aerodrome?

156
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:04,967
You mean an airport lounge?

157
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:06,433
- Aerodrome?
- Aerodrome?

158
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,000
Like an airport lounge.

159
00:07:08,066 --> 00:07:10,266
All right. Got it.

160
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,467
- Snacks?
- Hey, Tae Hyung. Hurry in.

161
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:13,600
Wait, what?

162
00:07:17,667 --> 00:07:19,333
Are you wearing uniforms?

163
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,834
Why are you wearing white?

164
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,100
What's this?

165
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,900
There's no food.

166
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,433
They said we need to prep.

167
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:28,667
- What?
- We should prepare the food.

168
00:07:28,734 --> 00:07:30,233
What should we order?

169
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,800
Well…

170
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:33,500
Tacos? How about tacos?

171
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,233
I know a good kimchi stew place.

172
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,400
Where is it?

173
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:39,233
When we hang out,

174
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,734
Tae Hyung knows delivery food best.

175
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,934
I eat a lot of delivery food.

176
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,367
Is that so? Why don't you order some?

177
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:49,633
I'll order something

178
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,066
I've been craving.

179
00:07:54,734 --> 00:07:57,233
The boss likes Hawaiian pizza.

180
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:02,533
A staff gathering is for staff members,

181
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,100
not the boss.

182
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,000
That's right.

183
00:08:05,066 --> 00:08:07,333
I feel like I can already see the future.

184
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,333
No matter how hard we think,

185
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,166
we're gonna get scolded again.

186
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,834
"Look, Tae Hyung."

187
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,100
"Don't you think this is too much?"

188
00:08:21,066 --> 00:08:22,166
From now on,

189
00:08:22,233 --> 00:08:25,133
I'm going to say I'm good
at impersonating Seo Jin.

190
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,767
"Success, my foot."

191
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:29,433
"Love, my foot."

192
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,967
"Success, my foot."

193
00:08:33,367 --> 00:08:35,200
Order all the popular menus.

194
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:43,667
Hello. It's been a while.

195
00:08:43,734 --> 00:08:45,767
Thank goodness. Seo Jun is in black.

196
00:08:45,834 --> 00:08:47,433
Seo Jun is here.

197
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,400
I almost wore a white top today.

198
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:52,266
Our styles are so similar today.

199
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,066
The pizza is here.

200
00:09:00,567 --> 00:09:02,000
Seo Jin is here.

201
00:09:02,066 --> 00:09:04,166
- Hello.
- Hello.

202
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,300
- Are you surprised?
- You're so quiet.

203
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,667
Am I supposed to be loud?

204
00:09:07,667 --> 00:09:08,567
How have you been?

205
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,467
Good.

206
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,734
- What are you doing?
- We're unpacking.

207
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,767
There's only one slice each.

208
00:09:15,834 --> 00:09:18,266
So you gotta call dibs on what you want.

209
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:20,800
What… What's all this?

210
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:23,600
This place only serves pizza in slices.

211
00:09:23,667 --> 00:09:25,266
Did you order just five slices?

212
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:27,567
Yes. But there's more food coming.

213
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,400
See? I told you you'd be scolded.

214
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:32,934
Here's Hawaiian, for you.

215
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,300
Tae Hyung is the one
who likes Hawaiian pizza.

216
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,600
No, I don't.

217
00:09:39,867 --> 00:09:42,333
Give the Hawaiian pizza to Seo Jin.

218
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,433
I said I didn't like Hawaiian pizza.

219
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,834
Come on. You love it.

220
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,166
No, I don't. I don't even like Hawaii.

221
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,100
- Are you getting Hawaiian?
- No, Pepperoni.

222
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,033
What is this?

223
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,100
Dad.

224
00:10:09,934 --> 00:10:11,633
Is this all we have?

225
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:14,133
Can we start now?

226
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,700
Yes, let's dig in.

227
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:21,266
Let's eat.

228
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,333
Seo Jin.

229
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,300
Could you say, "Let's eat?"

230
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,266
Say what?

231
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,400
"Let's eat."

232
00:10:29,467 --> 00:10:31,934
- Just once?
- No.

233
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:38,266
What else did you order?

234
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:40,033
We ordered a party combo.

235
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,734
Kimchi stew.

236
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,467
- Kimchi stew?
- Yes.

237
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:44,700
You ordered that too?

238
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:46,967
Well, I wanted it, so…

239
00:10:47,033 --> 00:10:49,233
You should've called me too.

240
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,400
I could've told you what I wanted to eat.

241
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:55,100
Not so that you could help them?

242
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,233
- No.
- But to order what you want?

243
00:10:58,467 --> 00:10:59,834
Happens every time.

244
00:11:03,667 --> 00:11:04,734
Hello.

245
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,600
Yu Mi.

246
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,400
- Sit here.
- You have bangs now.

247
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:10,667
Yeah, I have bangs now.

248
00:11:10,734 --> 00:11:13,066
What's going on here? Why
do we have pizza?

249
00:11:13,133 --> 00:11:14,500
To eat.

250
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:16,567
It's our staff gathering.

251
00:11:16,633 --> 00:11:18,233
They said more food is coming.

252
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,867
- Yeah?
- For our party.

253
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:21,033
They're coming.

254
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,266
We're gonna ask you some questions

255
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:26,567
that the viewers had.

256
00:11:26,633 --> 00:11:29,133
One of the most common questions we got is

257
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,600
"Why did you open at 2 PM?"

258
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:34,300
"Isn't it too late for a lunch service?"

259
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,700
Excuse me,
but are we here for clarification?

260
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,000
We opened at 1 PM once, and nobody came.

261
00:11:42,066 --> 00:11:43,100
No.

262
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:45,633
There aren't many people
on the street at 1 PM.

263
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:51,800
It's going away.

264
00:11:53,266 --> 00:11:54,166
Do you need help?

265
00:11:54,233 --> 00:11:55,400
Want tacos?

266
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:56,266
I'd love to.

267
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:57,934
Tacos sound great.

268
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:07,100
The street is so empty.

269
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,433
There's no one.

270
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:11,533
- Hello.
- Hello.

271
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:13,567
- Three orders.
- Three?

272
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,166
- To-go? Or...
- To-go.

273
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,800
That's a popular spot I heard.

274
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,166
But there are no people.

275
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:22,367
Why is it so empty?

276
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,533
We shouldn't open early.

277
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,467
There's no need to.

278
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:58,066
We'll have customers around sunset.

279
00:12:58,066 --> 00:12:59,567
There are no people.

280
00:12:59,633 --> 00:13:01,567
I think we should open late.

281
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:03,767
I'm not saying we'll only do dinner.

282
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,500
We should open late afternoon.

283
00:13:05,567 --> 00:13:07,767
Is this even a touristic place?

284
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,300
- I'm not opening the restaurant.
- What?

285
00:13:10,367 --> 00:13:11,367
Why?

286
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,333
Because there's no one.

287
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,133
- There's no one?
- There's literally nobody.

288
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,533
You wanna delay opening?

289
00:13:18,533 --> 00:13:19,633
I think we should.

290
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,800
I think we can take it slow.

291
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:25,900
There's no point opening at this hour.

292
00:13:25,967 --> 00:13:27,633
Even here, there's no one around.

293
00:13:33,734 --> 00:13:34,900
- Seo Jun.
- Yes.

294
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:38,266
I was thinking we should open at 2 PM.

295
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:40,400
And start working at noon.

296
00:13:40,467 --> 00:13:41,567
That sounds good.

297
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:42,633
And…

298
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:44,834
close late.

299
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,100
I think the peak hours are

300
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:49,400
right when people go home
after hanging out.

301
00:13:49,934 --> 00:13:51,066
Or after 8 PM.

302
00:13:51,133 --> 00:13:52,600
- Right.
- Okay.

303
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:56,133
It's a vacation spot thing.
People have late breakfasts,

304
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,700
hang out, and then have late lunch.

305
00:13:59,767 --> 00:14:02,300
When you're on a trip,

306
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:03,934
you don't always eat regularly.

307
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,600
Some customers came at 2 PM.

308
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,000
and some came at 4 PM.

309
00:14:08,066 --> 00:14:11,600
On average,
people started coming after 2 PM.

310
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,800
Many people wondered about

311
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:15,033
the dog too.

312
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,166
- Perro.
- Perro.

313
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:18,867
His name was Seo Jin at first.

314
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,967
- But, that's when...
- Jinny.

315
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,567
After trying,
you decided to go with Perro.

316
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,266
Why is he Perro?

317
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:29,133
- Woo Shik started it.
- He changed the name.

318
00:14:29,133 --> 00:14:30,433
Why'd you call him Perro?

319
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:32,867
It means "dog" in Spanish.

320
00:14:32,934 --> 00:14:35,200
I was basically calling him dog.

321
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:41,967
It's a dog.

322
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:43,266
A dog came in.

323
00:14:44,266 --> 00:14:46,133
It has at least three names.

324
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,166
Seo Jin.

325
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,266
What's she saying?

326
00:14:53,367 --> 00:14:54,467
Inny.

327
00:14:54,533 --> 00:14:55,834
Inny.

328
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,000
Perro.

329
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,300
Perro.

330
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,400
Why Perro though?

331
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:05,300
- Perro?
- Yes.

332
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:06,967
It means dog.

333
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:08,233
Perro?

334
00:15:34,834 --> 00:15:35,967
Come on. Run with me.

335
00:15:36,633 --> 00:15:37,633
Follow me.

336
00:15:39,233 --> 00:15:40,800
Perro, come here.

337
00:15:42,367 --> 00:15:45,567
Let's go back. Come here.

338
00:15:45,633 --> 00:15:47,166
Perro, wait.

339
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,667
Perro, wait.

340
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,734
He's seeing them off.

341
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:59,133
He's saying bye.

342
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,133
Didn't he follow Yu Mi
when she biked home?

343
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,367
- He followed you home.
- I was surprised.

344
00:16:07,367 --> 00:16:09,700
I thought he'd stop at some point.

345
00:16:09,767 --> 00:16:12,300
Did you have food in your bag?

346
00:16:12,367 --> 00:16:15,500
Or some grass dogs like?

347
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:17,633
No. He's a black dog, right?

348
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,367
That place was dark,

349
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:20,867
so I didn't see him.

350
00:16:20,934 --> 00:16:23,367
Then I realized something was there,

351
00:16:23,433 --> 00:16:24,967
and Perro was following me.

352
00:16:25,033 --> 00:16:28,033
And he followed me for a long time.

353
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,734
It was quite touching.

354
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,133
I wonder how he's doing.

355
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,667
I hope he's well.

356
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,500
I think we got something.

357
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:37,033
From two different spots.

358
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:38,734
Gosh, you ordered lots of food.

359
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:45,333
- You did order a lot of food.
- This is a lot of food.

360
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,567
Is this the kimchi stew?

361
00:16:46,633 --> 00:16:48,800
Yes, this is kimchi stew.

362
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,100
Why do we have this?

363
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,567
It's braised kimchi.

364
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,333
Tae Hyung must really like it.

365
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,967
- Hey, this is good.
- It's good, right?

366
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:02,834
I like it the most.

367
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,166
What do you like?

368
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:06,600
- The braised kimchi.
- Is it good?

369
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:07,867
Do you want some rice?

370
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:13,433
Seo Jin, do you like the menus?

371
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,100
The interns ordered them.

372
00:17:16,533 --> 00:17:18,266
This braised kimchi is good.

373
00:17:20,066 --> 00:17:22,000
I thought you'd scold us for that.

374
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,400
Why would I? I'm only eating this.

375
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,467
While eating,
we'll move on to the next question.

376
00:17:27,533 --> 00:17:29,333
Here's one of the questions

377
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,567
from the viewers.

378
00:17:40,633 --> 00:17:43,500
I was told from the chef
that since Bacalar is so hot,

379
00:17:43,567 --> 00:17:46,667
if we prepare the ingredients
like we do in Korea,

380
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:49,400
they'll go bad soon.

381
00:17:49,467 --> 00:17:50,500
That's why.

382
00:17:50,567 --> 00:17:52,700
It was really hot in Mexico.

383
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:55,667
That's why we had to use fresh veggies.

384
00:17:55,734 --> 00:17:58,200
This is also
why I couldn't roll them in advance.

385
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:00,567
We didn't know when we'd get orders.

386
00:18:00,633 --> 00:18:01,900
They're fresh veggies,

387
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:03,700
but they could still go bad.

388
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:05,800
And the laver would get wrinkly soon.

389
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,734
One day, it's flat and dry,

390
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,467
but on other days, it'd get wrinkly

391
00:18:13,533 --> 00:18:15,333
while I'm adding the ingredients.

392
00:18:18,233 --> 00:18:20,834
And it was different each day.

393
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,567
That's why…

394
00:18:56,033 --> 00:18:59,166
People here are good with spicy.

395
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,367
That was really good.

396
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,000
I'll show them K-Chicken.

397
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:50,266
Unbelievable.

398
00:19:50,266 --> 00:19:52,400
The best thing I've had in my entire life.

399
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,900
I made so many ramyeons today.

400
00:20:26,367 --> 00:20:28,934
It'll be delicious.

401
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,633
I'm gonna be

402
00:20:44,967 --> 00:20:46,934
the master of gimbap.

403
00:20:57,834 --> 00:20:58,834
Mmm!

404
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,133
Many people think

405
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,667
Woo Shik is a social, friendly person,

406
00:21:18,734 --> 00:21:20,433
but according to what we heard,

407
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,867
- his MBTI type starts with an I.
- Right.

408
00:21:22,934 --> 00:21:25,734
And some viewers wonder if it's true.

409
00:21:25,734 --> 00:21:26,800
They didn't believe it.

410
00:21:26,867 --> 00:21:27,934
What's an I?

411
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,233
I stands for introverted

412
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,100
and E stands for extroverted.

413
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,767
I'm an I.

414
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:35,300
That means he's shy.

415
00:21:35,367 --> 00:21:36,800
- Right.
- Yes.

416
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:38,333
He's trying really hard.

417
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,934
Also,

418
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,000
the boss was there.

419
00:21:42,066 --> 00:21:43,600
He was watching you.

420
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:46,967
Was he pushing you?

421
00:21:47,033 --> 00:21:48,767
- Him eyeing was the stick.
- Right.

422
00:21:48,834 --> 00:21:50,867
He's not the type who slacks off.

423
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,700
A server has to juggle many tasks.

424
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,934
Getting orders and serving and all.

425
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:56,100
That's why he got tired.

426
00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:59,000
He can be sensitive.

427
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:01,567
If you knew that, why…

428
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:03,734
Why did you ask him to distribute flyers?

429
00:22:03,734 --> 00:22:05,400
He's an I!

430
00:22:05,467 --> 00:22:08,600
You asked an I to distribute flyers.

431
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:10,567
Woo Shik.

432
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,867
Wanna distribute flyers?

433
00:22:18,667 --> 00:22:19,800
You don't wanna do it?

434
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,100
Just the flyers.

435
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:30,900
His face then…

436
00:22:30,967 --> 00:22:32,233
I think he cursed inside.

437
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:33,834
You can tell us the truth now.

438
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,800
Did you curse inside or not?

439
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,600
Give him a second.

440
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,166
This question makes me feel uncomfortable.

441
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,567
So you did.

442
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:48,767
You did curse inside.

443
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,633
I usually don't read comments.

444
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:54,934
And my mom sent me some screenshots.

445
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,166
"How dare he says no

446
00:22:58,233 --> 00:23:00,333
to his boss?"

447
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:05,033
"If I had an employee like that,

448
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,567
I'd go nuts."

449
00:23:07,633 --> 00:23:08,600
Something like that.

450
00:23:08,667 --> 00:23:11,734
When Woo Shik said no to me,

451
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,033
it actually made me want to send him more.

452
00:23:14,567 --> 00:23:16,433
"Look at this punk." Like this.

453
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,467
It made me want to send him out more.

454
00:23:18,533 --> 00:23:20,133
If you re-watch the footage,

455
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:22,967
you'll see I'm walking really fast.

456
00:23:25,133 --> 00:23:27,333
So you could go back quickly.

457
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,600
Seo Jin did lots of things
in the dining area for sure,

458
00:23:34,667 --> 00:23:37,233
but I think Woo Shik was the one

459
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:39,166
who worked most there.

460
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,433
I think we should make this clear.

461
00:23:44,433 --> 00:23:47,233
Well, this is…

462
00:23:48,266 --> 00:23:49,600
- Let's talk.
- Go on.

463
00:23:49,667 --> 00:23:51,734
- Go ahead.
- I'd say the front kitchen.

464
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,166
It was really hot there.

465
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:54,166
That's how I felt.

466
00:23:54,233 --> 00:23:57,033
I think both were equally hard.

467
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,533
The back kitchen had the AC,
but they also worked around the heat.

468
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:01,967
I've been there too.

469
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,500
I thought it was cool,
but it'd be hot if you stayed.

470
00:24:04,533 --> 00:24:06,066
In the front kitchen,

471
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:08,066
we had a fan.

472
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,333
But it only blew hot air.

473
00:24:10,266 --> 00:24:12,667
The front kitchen was a little harder.

474
00:24:12,734 --> 00:24:14,633
Because in the back kitchen,

475
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:16,200
we don't always have to smile.

476
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:18,100
We could look as tired as we wanted.

477
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:21,033
But in the front kitchen, they couldn't.

478
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:25,700
They had to smile to serve the customers.

479
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:28,600
He's a great kitchen staff now.

480
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,867
He's a pro kitchen staff.

481
00:24:32,533 --> 00:24:34,600
That's why an open kitchen is hard.

482
00:24:34,667 --> 00:24:35,500
Right.

483
00:24:35,567 --> 00:24:37,600
Also, it didn't show clearly,

484
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:39,834
but the ceiling was like a greenhouse.

485
00:24:39,934 --> 00:24:42,467
It was transparent,

486
00:24:42,533 --> 00:24:45,767
which let the sunlight come right through.

487
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:03,533
It's the hottest day ever.

488
00:25:08,567 --> 00:25:10,166
It's so hot in here, Seo Jin.

489
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:11,967
I'm melting.

490
00:25:12,033 --> 00:25:14,200
I'm sweating like a pig.

491
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,800
It's so hot in here.

492
00:25:20,867 --> 00:25:23,000
I'll ask a question to Seo Jun now.

493
00:25:23,066 --> 00:25:23,900
Okay.

494
00:25:23,967 --> 00:25:26,133
Seo Jun, you started your career

495
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,834
as a server.

496
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,133
You used to be a server,

497
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,266
but this time,
you were mostly in the kitchen.

498
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,000
Boss is the only position I haven't done.

499
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:41,300
Boss is the only one?

500
00:25:41,367 --> 00:25:43,934
Yeah, other positions are already…

501
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,500
What are you gonna do?

502
00:25:47,033 --> 00:25:48,133
Just kidding.

503
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,400
I did feel more comfortable
in the kitchen.

504
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:54,433
In the kitchen,
I just need to get the orders done.

505
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,800
But the dining area,
things are unpredictable.

506
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,433
You gotta keep thinking about the service.

507
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:03,433
You don't know what people will order,
which makes it a little harder.

508
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,200
Next time, if you can choose,

509
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:07,333
where would you like to work?

510
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:09,900
It's hard to be a chef.

511
00:26:10,567 --> 00:26:14,333
Well, if not me,
who else is gonna manage the kitchen?

512
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,934
Right.

513
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:16,834
There's no one.

514
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,567
I can go back in.

515
00:26:18,633 --> 00:26:19,800
- I can go back in.
- No.

516
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:23,433
Seo Jin, is this really the end for me?

517
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,934
You got a life-long job here.

518
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,033
Hey, you said I'm gonna retire.

519
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,300
You'll be our adviser.

520
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:33,266
- Why would an adviser go there?
- There's no retirement.

521
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,700
You're an adviser.

522
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:37,133
You said earlier at the staff evaluation

523
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
that Seo Jun was the best employee.

524
00:26:39,266 --> 00:26:41,100
Do you still think

525
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,633
he's shown the best performance?

526
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,667
What I meant is,

527
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,600
he's the only one who could lead
this team when I'm gone.

528
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:48,700
What about Yu Mi?

529
00:26:48,767 --> 00:26:50,967
She spent her whole youth here.

530
00:26:51,033 --> 00:26:52,834
I spent six years of my life here.

531
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:55,467
Yu Mi got a life-long job here.

532
00:26:56,934 --> 00:26:58,266
Even after Seo Jun retires

533
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,367
and Woo Shik and Tae Hyung
become boss,

534
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,700
Yu Mi will still be here.

535
00:27:03,033 --> 00:27:04,667
Like a ghost?

536
00:27:04,734 --> 00:27:06,867
- Yes.
- Haunting our restaurant forever?

537
00:27:06,934 --> 00:27:10,300
She's an adviser,
so she's gonna get a special treatment

538
00:27:10,367 --> 00:27:12,400
as an honorary staff.

539
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,200
Until she's 70.

540
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:17,000
Like Yoda?

541
00:27:20,166 --> 00:27:22,867
If Seo Jun becomes boss
and we open Junny's Kitchen,

542
00:27:22,934 --> 00:27:24,700
- Yes.
- that could hurt

543
00:27:24,767 --> 00:27:26,367
Yu Mi's feelings.

544
00:27:26,467 --> 00:27:28,433
No, not at all.

545
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,066
If Seo Jun becomes the boss
and we open Junny's Kitchen…

546
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,967
Are you crying, Yu Mi?

547
00:27:39,133 --> 00:27:41,400
Tae Hyung got a few questions too.

548
00:27:41,467 --> 00:27:42,633
During his staff evaluation,

549
00:27:42,667 --> 00:27:44,166
Seo Jin said you were slow as molasses.

550
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:48,500
Fans say he was actually being fast.

551
00:27:48,567 --> 00:27:49,800
Right.

552
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,000
That's true.

553
00:27:53,066 --> 00:27:54,433
That's so true.

554
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,300
True story.

555
00:27:56,367 --> 00:27:58,467
What do you think yourself?

556
00:27:58,467 --> 00:28:00,266
Were you being as fast as you could?

557
00:28:03,367 --> 00:28:05,934
I don't agree that I was slow.

558
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,433
From what I saw, I was really fast.

559
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,333
Well…

560
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,433
I have my reasons.

561
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:15,200
I grated all the veggies manually.

562
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:17,667
That's why I seemed slow.

563
00:28:17,734 --> 00:28:20,300
Seriously, the dishes too.

564
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:23,667
It never took me longer than ten minutes.

565
00:28:23,734 --> 00:28:26,367
I always finished them
in eight, nine minutes.

566
00:28:26,433 --> 00:28:28,066
So almost ten minutes.

567
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:33,433
This made me think

568
00:28:33,533 --> 00:28:35,967
what I could do best

569
00:28:36,033 --> 00:28:39,567
and related to my actual career.

570
00:28:39,633 --> 00:28:41,967
You know the air dancers
in front of stores?

571
00:28:43,767 --> 00:28:44,834
I can do that.

572
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,400
- In the next season.
- Yes.

573
00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:49,734
From 2 PM until 4 PM?

574
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:55,467
You can have an hour break.

575
00:28:56,533 --> 00:28:58,400
That's gonna take one whole album.

576
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,667
Another thing people asked.

577
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,033
"Whenever Seo Jin saw Tae Hyung
eat ramyeon, he laughed so hard."

578
00:29:10,633 --> 00:29:12,767
"What's so funny about it?"

579
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:14,500
Someone asked this.

580
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:16,834
He's eaten so much ramyeon.

581
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,834
I'm pretty sure what's aired was
not even one-third of it.

582
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,734
I agree.

583
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,800
He ate it so often.

584
00:29:21,867 --> 00:29:23,667
If you air all of them,

585
00:29:23,734 --> 00:29:25,734
they'll know why I laughed.

586
00:29:26,533 --> 00:29:29,166
He was eating three, four packs
of ramyeon a day.

587
00:29:29,166 --> 00:29:30,433
I was impressed.

588
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,900
Some people who haven't met me
for a while said,

589
00:29:32,967 --> 00:29:34,200
"I watched Jinny's Kitchen."

590
00:29:34,266 --> 00:29:36,633
"You were eating so much ramyeon."

591
00:29:36,967 --> 00:29:39,000
You had it almost every day, right?

592
00:29:39,066 --> 00:29:40,367
He did have it every day.

593
00:29:40,433 --> 00:29:43,333
I think Yu Mi also had
at least one pack every day.

594
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,500
Yu Mi was the same.

595
00:29:45,567 --> 00:29:46,400
You're right.

596
00:29:46,467 --> 00:29:48,300
These two argued over ramyeon too.

597
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:50,567
That was really funny,
but it was edited out.

598
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:53,200
- Tae Hyung, are you making ramyeon?
- Yes.

599
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,200
Seo Jun.

600
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,133
Could you make me some jjajang ramyeon?

601
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,700
He's cooking multiple packs every night.

602
00:30:06,767 --> 00:30:09,200
My goal is 100 packs.

603
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,133
I bet Tae Hyung will have
jjajang ramyeon soon.

604
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,133
He must be addicted to ramyeon.

605
00:30:20,166 --> 00:30:21,734
Have you always liked it?

606
00:30:21,767 --> 00:30:23,500
Yes, I love it.

607
00:30:25,834 --> 00:30:27,467
Will you have some tomorrow?

608
00:30:28,033 --> 00:30:29,433
I bet they will.

609
00:30:30,266 --> 00:30:32,033
Tae Hyung, how many ramyeons did you eat?

610
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:35,533
- He had four packs a day.
- Really?

611
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:46,734
Why does he look so tired today?

612
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,533
You need some ramyeon now.

613
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,033
You look so pale.

614
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,367
You look the happiest
when you eat ramyeon.

615
00:30:53,433 --> 00:30:54,767
It's so good.

616
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,934
One pack at 12 AM.

617
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,934
One pack at 2 AM.

618
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:06,233
I'm gonna mix some rice with it too.

619
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,834
Tae Hyung, take it easy.

620
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,000
Nobody's stealing your food.

621
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,500
Do you want some?

622
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,834
Why does everyone hate ramyeon?

623
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,867
We don't hate it.

624
00:31:28,934 --> 00:31:30,734
It's just that you like it a lot.

625
00:31:34,233 --> 00:31:35,600
Yu Mi, do you want some?

626
00:31:35,667 --> 00:31:38,133
- What?
- Do you want some noodles?

627
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,900
Of course. If you want some too, I'm in.

628
00:31:40,967 --> 00:31:41,967
Let's go.

629
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
Yu Mi, eat this with the meat.

630
00:32:00,734 --> 00:32:02,400
It's so tasty.

631
00:32:07,266 --> 00:32:09,967
Are we leaving at 10:40 AM tomorrow?

632
00:32:10,033 --> 00:32:12,100
Let's leave at 11:40 AM. I'm serious.

633
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:17,967
If you eat one more pack
of ramyeon, we will.

634
00:32:27,033 --> 00:32:28,333
I can do that.

635
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,333
- One more pack?
- Yes, now.

636
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:33,734
Then I'll make jjajang ramyeon and…

637
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:38,800
- Jjajang.
- If you wanted some more, just say so.

638
00:32:38,867 --> 00:32:42,300
No, I meant as a performance.

639
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:44,367
Yu Mi, come on.

640
00:32:48,033 --> 00:32:49,000
How many?

641
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,667
We're running out of ramyeon.

642
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:54,233
Because they ate all of them.

643
00:32:56,633 --> 00:32:58,333
They eat ramyeon every day.

644
00:33:03,467 --> 00:33:05,633
All right. Here we go.

645
00:33:13,266 --> 00:33:15,033
Why did you put your chopsticks down?

646
00:33:15,033 --> 00:33:16,734
Take the noodles.

647
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,100
This--

648
00:33:21,166 --> 00:33:22,600
- Oh, no.
- Hey.

649
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,166
- What are you doing?
- Sorry.

650
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,467
I'm still digesting the food
I had earlier.

651
00:33:26,533 --> 00:33:28,166
The ramyeon is still in here.

652
00:33:28,233 --> 00:33:29,266
Yu Mi.

653
00:33:31,033 --> 00:33:32,133
Huh?

654
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,834
Why is this here?

655
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,100
So you can have some.

656
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:37,000
Do you need help?

657
00:33:37,066 --> 00:33:39,100
No, I can do it myself.

658
00:33:39,166 --> 00:33:40,367
I'll do it myself!

659
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:42,133
You're not eating any.

660
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,333
I'll do it myself.

661
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,700
Let me do it myself.

662
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:47,667
Just this much.

663
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,567
Hey!

664
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,900
- Eat the noodles first.
- Let me clean it up.

665
00:33:52,967 --> 00:33:54,233
- I'll clean it.
- No, I…

666
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,967
You eat the noodles.

667
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:58,000
Eat it. I'll clean it.

668
00:33:58,033 --> 00:34:00,433
- After digesting the food.
- No.

669
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,533
Yu Mi.

670
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,500
Come on. Sit down.

671
00:34:02,567 --> 00:34:04,333
I'm still full.

672
00:34:06,467 --> 00:34:08,233
- Huh?
- Huh?

673
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,967
What's wrong with you, Yu Mi?

674
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:11,967
- Yu Mi.
- If she doesn't eat it,

675
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:13,333
- you have to finish.
- Yu Mi.

676
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:16,233
You know that, right?

677
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:18,600
If Yu Mi doesn't eat it,
you have to eat it.

678
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:19,467
When you sleep,

679
00:34:19,533 --> 00:34:21,200
I'll put this next to your bed.

680
00:34:24,767 --> 00:34:27,300
Yu Mi picked up the chopsticks.
She's gonna eat it.

681
00:34:27,767 --> 00:34:29,867
You like it, huh?

682
00:34:32,667 --> 00:34:34,066
- Yu Mi.
- Yes?

683
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:36,633
I'll eat it.

684
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,667
Tae Hyung, you can stop now. I'll eat it.

685
00:34:46,233 --> 00:34:47,700
But it's tasty.

686
00:34:47,767 --> 00:34:51,734
He doesn't want to give it to you.

687
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,266
What are you saying?

688
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:04,033
So 11:40 AM it is.

689
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,333
But we must leave at 11:40 AM sharp, okay?

690
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,233
Tae Hyung worked so hard.

691
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,467
Do you want to leave at 12:30 PM?

692
00:35:14,066 --> 00:35:15,100
For one more pack?

693
00:35:19,166 --> 00:35:21,600
Gosh, 12:40 PM?

694
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:24,433
What? 12:40 PM? Delay one more hour?

695
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:25,867
That'll make me so happy--

696
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:31,667
But the day after tomorrow,
you and Woo Shik must leave early.

697
00:35:31,734 --> 00:35:33,300
And after that day,

698
00:35:33,367 --> 00:35:35,800
you'll leave early alone?

699
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,367
No, you two will always leave early.

700
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:41,033
Yu Mi, I finished your ramyeon. Remember?

701
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,600
- I'll stay quiet.
- What?

702
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,633
I'll just stay quiet.

703
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:46,600
How could you make me
leave early the day after tomorrow?

704
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:48,667
Seriously.

705
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:51,133
- Do we have cucumbers?
- Huh?

706
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:52,567
Cucumbers in the restaurant.

707
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,734
Why do you ask me?

708
00:35:58,767 --> 00:36:00,467
I don't feel like

709
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:02,066
talking with you face-to-face.

710
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:03,800
Don't talk to me like that.

711
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,066
Yu Mi, I'm going to bed.

712
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:10,033
Good night.

713
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:11,467
- Yu Mi.
- Yes?

714
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:14,700
You know I wasn't joking, right?

715
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:16,867
Go to bed.

716
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:19,300
- Good night, Yu Mi.
- Good night.

717
00:36:19,367 --> 00:36:20,266
Good night.

718
00:36:21,333 --> 00:36:23,700
Anyway, I was the one
who made them eat ramyeon,

719
00:36:23,734 --> 00:36:26,033
but Yu Mi is the one
who betrayed him.

720
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:28,700
Right?

721
00:36:28,767 --> 00:36:32,033
Well, I'm an executive too, after all.

722
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:34,200
That day, it had nothing to do with that.

723
00:36:34,266 --> 00:36:36,600
- You were being selfish.
- You… Yes, exactly.

724
00:36:36,667 --> 00:36:37,500
No, I was not.

725
00:36:37,567 --> 00:36:38,800
You gotta admit it.

726
00:36:40,166 --> 00:36:42,166
Now, the last question.

727
00:36:42,233 --> 00:36:43,734
Each of you had a role

728
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,934
in the restaurant in Bacalar, right?

729
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,333
The interns and the executives
had different roles.

730
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:50,934
While the boss is here,

731
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,934
tell him a bit about your ambitions.

732
00:36:52,934 --> 00:36:54,700
For example, if you were a server,

733
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,867
maybe you wanna try something else.

734
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,800
Or maybe if you were a kitchen staff,
you'd like to serve.

735
00:36:59,867 --> 00:37:03,266
If you have any specific
career goals or desires,

736
00:37:03,266 --> 00:37:07,066
- please share it while the boss is here.
- Like the roles you want.

737
00:37:11,467 --> 00:37:14,033
I don't know what else I can do.

738
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:16,200
Maybe, when the whole setting changes.

739
00:37:23,834 --> 00:37:26,066
Since the interns had a lot of tasks,

740
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:28,600
I'd like to hear from them too.

741
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:29,633
Tae Hyung.

742
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,200
Tae Hyung wants to do this.

743
00:37:31,266 --> 00:37:35,767
The air dancer.
He wants to be promoted to an air dancer.

744
00:37:35,834 --> 00:37:37,500
Well, I…

745
00:37:37,567 --> 00:37:39,667
What's the topic?
About how we felt?

746
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:42,900
Are there other jobs you want to try?

747
00:37:42,967 --> 00:37:44,133
Look.

748
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,266
While we were talking,

749
00:37:45,333 --> 00:37:48,467
those interns are playing
with the rubber bands.

750
00:37:48,533 --> 00:37:49,934
You saw that?

751
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,867
They're not interested in this.

752
00:37:51,934 --> 00:37:54,367
They're just playing with the rubber band.

753
00:37:54,433 --> 00:37:56,533
Well, it's not like

754
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,367
you're gonna let us do as we say.

755
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,667
We finished eating, so let's go.

756
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,433
That's it for the Q&A.
You'll play a game now.

757
00:38:17,066 --> 00:38:18,100
What could it be?

758
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,500
And us, the production crew prepared
a present too.

759
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:23,300
What is it?

760
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,266
You'll divide into two teams

761
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:28,600
to play the game.

762
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:29,934
But we're five people.

763
00:38:32,433 --> 00:38:33,700
You're dividing us again?

764
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:34,667
Who are the employees?

765
00:38:34,734 --> 00:38:36,934
Seo Jin and Yu Mi will team up

766
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,867
and the rest three will team up.

767
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:42,633
The liquor the boss brought
will be the prize.

768
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,400
And we prepared

769
00:38:50,467 --> 00:38:51,900
ten 100,000 won gift cards.

770
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,800
The winner will take them all.

771
00:38:56,867 --> 00:38:58,200
This is gonna be easy.

772
00:38:58,667 --> 00:39:01,266
You only like to play games.

773
00:39:01,333 --> 00:39:03,700
- Yu Mi is good at games.
- We're winning this.

774
00:39:03,767 --> 00:39:05,033
Yu Mi is good at games.

775
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,600
You're going to play a game

776
00:39:07,667 --> 00:39:09,900
to introduce Korean culture to the world.

777
00:39:09,967 --> 00:39:11,133
We'll play Yut Nori.

778
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,066
Really?

779
00:39:12,133 --> 00:39:12,967
I love Yut Nori.

780
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:14,633
That's why we have this.

781
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:18,000
But it's not regular Yut Nori.

782
00:39:18,033 --> 00:39:19,633
It's no-foreign-language Yut Nori.

783
00:39:20,433 --> 00:39:23,900
If any of you speak English
during the game…

784
00:39:23,967 --> 00:39:26,433
If you speak English
or other foreign languages,

785
00:39:26,433 --> 00:39:28,333
your token will be removed.

786
00:39:28,367 --> 00:39:30,266
- Not even "Back Do?"
- What?

787
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:31,700
- Not even "Back Do?"
- No.

788
00:39:31,767 --> 00:39:33,967
- No "fighting."
- Say that in Korean.

789
00:39:34,033 --> 00:39:36,734
But this team has one more mouth to speak,

790
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:40,100
which means more chances to make mistakes.

791
00:39:40,166 --> 00:39:41,400
Therefore?

792
00:39:41,467 --> 00:39:42,333
What?

793
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,734
- That's it.
- That's it?

794
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:46,400
- I was just saying.
- Got it.

795
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,834
I was just informing you of the fact.

796
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:51,200
- Shall we begin?
- Who's going first?

797
00:39:51,266 --> 00:39:53,567
- Rock-paper-scissors,
- Rock-paper-scissors.

798
00:39:53,633 --> 00:39:55,433
- You go first.
- Okay.

799
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,333
- Okay.
- Tae Hyung.

800
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,600
- Tae Hyung, go.
- Okay.

801
00:40:00,066 --> 00:40:00,967
Gae.

802
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,700
- Are we red?
- Yes.

803
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:05,166
- Did you start?
- Gae.

804
00:40:06,467 --> 00:40:07,633
- Yu Mi.
- Bring them.

805
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,800
- You go.
- Bring them.

806
00:40:08,867 --> 00:40:10,734
- The thrower brings them.
- "Bring them?"

807
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,967
- Come on. Bring them.
- I'm wearing high heels. Bring them.

808
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:15,800
Take off the shoes.

809
00:40:15,867 --> 00:40:16,867
Take off the shoes.

810
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,533
Geol?

811
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,900
It's not great though.

812
00:40:23,967 --> 00:40:25,100
Geol.

813
00:40:28,033 --> 00:40:29,433
They started talking less.

814
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:30,333
You have to talk.

815
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,867
Nice.

816
00:40:31,934 --> 00:40:33,200
- Yut.
- Can I throw again?

817
00:40:34,033 --> 00:40:35,233
Yes, throw again.

818
00:40:39,433 --> 00:40:40,533
- Double Yut.
- What?

819
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,800
He's good.

820
00:40:41,867 --> 00:40:43,934
- Double Yut.
- He's a lucky guy.

821
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:47,800
- Geol.
- Double Yut and Geol.

822
00:40:47,867 --> 00:40:49,633
- Do, Gae, Geol, Yut.
- And…

823
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:51,633
- Take this away.
- Good. Throw again.

824
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:52,867
Then I'll throw again.

825
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:56,233
- Their tokens are all out.
- All three tokens.

826
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,033
Guys, let's be careful
with what we say from now.

827
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,400
Yut.

828
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:10,300
You're good.

829
00:41:10,367 --> 00:41:12,333
- This is my first time.
- Throw higher.

830
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,200
You gotta make them spin.

831
00:41:14,633 --> 00:41:15,967
Oh, that was good.

832
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:17,400
Move this one with Yut.

833
00:41:17,467 --> 00:41:20,266
- Okay.
- Do, Gae, Geol, Yut.

834
00:41:20,333 --> 00:41:21,367
Do, Gae, Geol.

835
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,166
Good.

836
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:26,033
- Good.
- Okay.

837
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,700
- It looks nice.
- Okay?

838
00:41:29,066 --> 00:41:30,934
- Okay.
- Take out the one you like.

839
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,266
- Take out a token.
- I say "Okay" so often.

840
00:41:33,333 --> 00:41:34,533
I…

841
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,667
Take out any token you like.

842
00:41:37,734 --> 00:41:39,433
Oh, he spoke English.

843
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,700
Oh.

844
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:41,700
- Why?
- Take one out.

845
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:42,867
- What?
- He spoke English.

846
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:43,667
What did he say?

847
00:41:43,734 --> 00:41:46,433
- Why…
- Seriously, I just…

848
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,767
- What did you just do?
- I…

849
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:50,233
It just came out.

850
00:41:51,567 --> 00:41:55,066
Good thinking.
It's better to take the closer one out.

851
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:57,533
It just came out.

852
00:41:58,300 --> 00:41:59,567
- Gae.
- Gae.

853
00:41:59,633 --> 00:42:00,900
- I'll move it.
- Sure.

854
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:03,600
Come on. Speak.

855
00:42:04,633 --> 00:42:05,433
Gae.

856
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,033
- Catch it.
- Are you catching it?

857
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:07,934
Catch it.

858
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,433
- And throw again.
- Okay.

859
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:13,433
Woo Shik, you're so quiet.

860
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,233
Do?

861
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,300
Put them together.

862
00:42:19,367 --> 00:42:21,200
Put one on another.

863
00:42:22,133 --> 00:42:23,867
This might end real quick.

864
00:42:26,066 --> 00:42:27,300
Gae.

865
00:42:27,367 --> 00:42:29,300
Great.

866
00:42:30,066 --> 00:42:32,200
Why do you even ask? It's obvious.

867
00:42:32,266 --> 00:42:33,333
Geol.

868
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,066
Geol.

869
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:36,433
Isn't "Geol" an English word?

870
00:42:38,166 --> 00:42:39,166
- Seo Jin.
- It's not.

871
00:42:39,233 --> 00:42:41,266
Come on, Seo Jin.

872
00:42:41,734 --> 00:42:43,533
Please, just do it.

873
00:42:44,967 --> 00:42:47,367
Could you not throw so half-heartedly?

874
00:42:47,433 --> 00:42:49,066
He's only getting Gaes.

875
00:42:49,133 --> 00:42:50,266
- Seo Jin.
- Here?

876
00:42:50,333 --> 00:42:51,667
- Take a new one.
- A new one?

877
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:53,533
That's an interesting move.

878
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,133
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I've played this a lot.

879
00:42:59,066 --> 00:42:59,900
Gae.

880
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:02,133
- They've got nothing to catch.
- Oh…

881
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,367
- That…
- Move that.

882
00:43:03,433 --> 00:43:04,533
- This one?
- Yes.

883
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,066
Tae Hyung, you should speak.

884
00:43:06,133 --> 00:43:07,967
Hey, what are you doing?

885
00:43:08,033 --> 00:43:09,834
- Why aren't you talking?
- I am talking.

886
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,967
Isn't this cheating?

887
00:43:13,033 --> 00:43:17,166
- You got a yellow card.
- All he's saying now is "Oh" and "Ah."

888
00:43:17,233 --> 00:43:18,100
Right?

889
00:43:19,567 --> 00:43:20,567
Seo Jin.

890
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:24,233
- It's…
- Oh.

891
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,900
- It hit him.
- Oh.

892
00:43:25,967 --> 00:43:26,834
Oh…

893
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:29,066
He's not supposed to talk like that.

894
00:43:29,133 --> 00:43:30,667
And he's just saying "Ah."

895
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:33,500
All they're saying is "Oh" and "Ah."

896
00:43:34,533 --> 00:43:36,100
- It's a foul. It hit him.
- Speak.

897
00:43:36,166 --> 00:43:37,934
- What's this? Yut?
- Yut.

898
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,500
- It's a foul.
- Well,

899
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:40,867
you should've moved.

900
00:43:40,934 --> 00:43:42,033
It's a foul.

901
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:43,867
Seo Jin, throw carefully.

902
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:45,633
Carefully how?

903
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,066
Just throw them on this mat.

904
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,000
Fine.

905
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,934
- You're throwing so many Gaes.
- Darn it.

906
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,333
- You're only getting Gaes.
- Only Gaes.

907
00:43:57,367 --> 00:43:58,233
Ah.

908
00:43:58,300 --> 00:43:59,133
Yu Mi.

909
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:01,000
You're waiting in that corner.

910
00:44:01,066 --> 00:44:03,834
Woo Shik has been only saying
"Ah" for ten minutes now

911
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,333
and he's only saying "Oh."

912
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,200
- What is this?
- No.

913
00:44:07,266 --> 00:44:08,867
- Seriously.
- No.

914
00:44:08,934 --> 00:44:12,100
Look. He's even speaking more quietly.

915
00:44:12,166 --> 00:44:13,500
- Go on.
- Let's continue.

916
00:44:14,767 --> 00:44:15,734
Gae.

917
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,734
Catch it.

918
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,967
- You can't.
- No tokens.

919
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:20,000
- Ah.
- Then…

920
00:44:20,066 --> 00:44:21,967
- Catch it?
- Should we move it here?

921
00:44:22,033 --> 00:44:23,300
Oh.

922
00:44:23,367 --> 00:44:26,033
See? He's saying "Oh" again.

923
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,533
- Good idea.
- Come on.

924
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:29,100
- Good idea.
- What's this?

925
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,133
- Good.
- Huh?

926
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:33,133
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

927
00:44:35,233 --> 00:44:36,667
- Yut.
- Yut.

928
00:44:40,367 --> 00:44:42,367
- She's gonna catch all of ours.
- No.

929
00:44:43,934 --> 00:44:45,433
- Oh.
- Double Yut! Nice!

930
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,467
They can catch them.

931
00:44:46,567 --> 00:44:47,934
Hold on. Double Yut.

932
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,467
We got two Yuts.

933
00:44:51,633 --> 00:44:52,734
Yut, Yut, Do?

934
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,700
- Yut, Yut, Do.
- Catch that at the end.

935
00:44:54,767 --> 00:44:56,133
- Okay, let's go.
- Move it?

936
00:44:56,200 --> 00:44:58,934
Catch that token with one Yut.

937
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,400
And with the Do…

938
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:02,066
Do… Wait, Seo Jin.

939
00:45:03,734 --> 00:45:05,500
She's a Yut Nori expert.

940
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:07,567
- Yu Mi is being careful.
- Hold on.

941
00:45:07,633 --> 00:45:09,066
The two tokens.

942
00:45:09,133 --> 00:45:10,233
I'll move them.

943
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,400
- Here?
- Yes.

944
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:15,967
They caught us.

945
00:45:16,033 --> 00:45:18,200
Tae Hyung, please speak.

946
00:45:18,266 --> 00:45:19,066
Say how you feel.

947
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:19,967
- Gae.
- Gae.

948
00:45:20,033 --> 00:45:20,834
Did we score?

949
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,233
No, not yet.

950
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,066
You need to go further than this.

951
00:45:24,133 --> 00:45:25,567
He's right.

952
00:45:26,266 --> 00:45:28,066
- Was it Gae?
- Yes.

953
00:45:28,133 --> 00:45:29,066
Then…

954
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:30,667
- Wait. I have a question.
- Yes?

955
00:45:30,734 --> 00:45:31,834
So you need a Geol?

956
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:34,266
We need at least a Geol to score.

957
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:35,200
Woo Shik.

958
00:45:35,266 --> 00:45:36,367
Don't ask questions.

959
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,033
Foul.

960
00:45:43,100 --> 00:45:43,934
It fell out.

961
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,233
- It's not your day.
- Anything would do. Even Do.

962
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,633
How is this even possible?

963
00:45:55,834 --> 00:45:57,467
- Seo Jin.
- Move the single one.

964
00:45:57,533 --> 00:45:59,934
We'll move the single token.

965
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,300
Yut.

966
00:46:04,667 --> 00:46:06,033
- Nice.
- Gae.

967
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,667
- Yut, Gae.
- We scored.

968
00:46:08,133 --> 00:46:09,367
Yut, Gae.

969
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,066
We never know yet.

970
00:46:13,133 --> 00:46:15,133
- We don't know yet.
- We need a Geol.

971
00:46:18,266 --> 00:46:19,633
I've been getting Gae only.

972
00:46:25,433 --> 00:46:26,767
Gosh, this is…

973
00:46:26,834 --> 00:46:28,033
That's just…

974
00:46:30,834 --> 00:46:32,333
He's a pro.

975
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,900
- With a Geol, we could've scored.
- Yes.

976
00:46:35,934 --> 00:46:38,667
- You need a Geol.
- You've been only getting Gaes.

977
00:46:38,734 --> 00:46:39,934
- Right?
- Yes.

978
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:43,266
Yut.

979
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:44,533
Whoa, that was close.

980
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:49,400
Yut.

981
00:46:49,467 --> 00:46:51,567
Wait, we might end the game here.

982
00:46:51,633 --> 00:46:53,000
They might catch us.

983
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:55,000
- Be careful--
- Geol.

984
00:46:55,066 --> 00:46:56,500
- Careful when you talk.
- Geol.

985
00:46:57,500 --> 00:46:58,433
Geol.

986
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:03,200
Did you say "Geol"

987
00:47:03,266 --> 00:47:05,700
or "girl"?

988
00:47:05,767 --> 00:47:09,200
Wait, did you just say "girl?"

989
00:47:09,266 --> 00:47:10,500
- No.
- What?

990
00:47:10,567 --> 00:47:12,700
What?

991
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:15,667
- "Girl?"
- Wait.

992
00:47:15,734 --> 00:47:17,967
Hold on a second.

993
00:47:18,033 --> 00:47:19,367
He just said "girl."

994
00:47:19,433 --> 00:47:21,300
- No, I didn't.
- What did you just say?

995
00:47:21,367 --> 00:47:23,100
Take out one token.

996
00:47:23,166 --> 00:47:24,500
No.

997
00:47:24,834 --> 00:47:26,433
You have to. Because…

998
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:30,200
- No.
- That's double. Move the single one.

999
00:47:30,266 --> 00:47:32,734
No, move the one over there.

1000
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,133
That's up to them.

1001
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:35,667
- We decide.
- Both of them?

1002
00:47:35,667 --> 00:47:36,767
Because they're double.

1003
00:47:37,867 --> 00:47:40,567
No!

1004
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,734
No, I worked so hard for that.

1005
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,667
"Did you say Geol or Girl?"

1006
00:47:48,734 --> 00:47:50,133
He just copied what I said.

1007
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,467
Why?

1008
00:47:57,533 --> 00:47:58,533
Why?

1009
00:47:59,066 --> 00:48:01,033
- Why?
- Nice.

1010
00:48:02,834 --> 00:48:03,734
Well done.

1011
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,166
Gosh, my neck hurts.

1012
00:48:06,266 --> 00:48:07,600
This feels so good.

1013
00:48:07,667 --> 00:48:08,667
This feels so good.

1014
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:11,467
Gosh, my neck hurts.

1015
00:48:11,533 --> 00:48:12,533
Let's just move on.

1016
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,367
Back to square one.

1017
00:48:24,867 --> 00:48:25,834
Back Do?

1018
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:26,967
- Back Do.
- What?

1019
00:48:27,033 --> 00:48:28,166
Oh.

1020
00:48:28,233 --> 00:48:29,433
- What did you say?
- What?

1021
00:48:29,500 --> 00:48:30,533
Take one token out.

1022
00:48:35,633 --> 00:48:38,000
We'll move this backward.

1023
00:48:39,033 --> 00:48:39,934
Either you or me.

1024
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,667
- This way.
- It's my turn.

1025
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:48,467
- She did it.
- Mo?

1026
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,433
Nice.

1027
00:48:52,967 --> 00:48:54,533
- Mo, Geol.
- That's perfect.

1028
00:48:58,700 --> 00:49:00,166
Are you making a turn there?

1029
00:49:02,734 --> 00:49:04,734
Nice.

1030
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:05,700
Yes.

1031
00:49:11,233 --> 00:49:13,066
Anything higher than Do, right?

1032
00:49:13,133 --> 00:49:14,233
But…

1033
00:49:18,867 --> 00:49:21,667
You did get a Do.

1034
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:26,467
You're getting worse and worse.

1035
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:29,700
To where it came from.

1036
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:31,533
- That's fair.
- Yes.

1037
00:49:44,367 --> 00:49:45,967
The chase has started.

1038
00:49:46,033 --> 00:49:46,867
Whose turn is it?

1039
00:49:51,367 --> 00:49:52,300
It's Gae.

1040
00:49:52,934 --> 00:49:54,500
- It's good.
- You can turn.

1041
00:49:54,567 --> 00:49:56,200
It's not bad.

1042
00:49:56,266 --> 00:49:58,967
If you don't catch that, you'll lose.

1043
00:49:59,033 --> 00:50:00,667
I believe in Seo Jin.

1044
00:50:00,734 --> 00:50:02,066
Me too.

1045
00:50:02,133 --> 00:50:04,200
He can't throw Geol.

1046
00:50:04,266 --> 00:50:05,734
Geol.

1047
00:50:05,800 --> 00:50:07,166
I believe in him.

1048
00:50:07,233 --> 00:50:09,500
I don't think I've ever thrown Geol today.

1049
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,367
What just happened?

1050
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:18,100
So little.

1051
00:50:18,166 --> 00:50:19,200
That's so little.

1052
00:50:23,367 --> 00:50:24,767
- We still have a chance.
- Yes.

1053
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,033
- What?
- Gosh.

1054
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:29,900
He's gonna score.

1055
00:50:29,967 --> 00:50:30,934
Let's go!

1056
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:36,567
Let's go!

1057
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,800
- He's good.
- He's good.

1058
00:50:46,834 --> 00:50:47,967
No! We can't score yet!

1059
00:50:50,767 --> 00:50:53,100
- One Back Do, and we're doomed!
- It's my turn.

1060
00:50:53,166 --> 00:50:54,667
Oh, no. It's my turn.

1061
00:50:54,734 --> 00:50:56,066
Please, I can't.

1062
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,700
Wait.

1063
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:12,333
We need a Do to score, right?

1064
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,333
Right.

1065
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,367
Gae, Geol, Yut, or Mo…

1066
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:19,500
- Anything higher than Do.
- No.

1067
00:51:19,567 --> 00:51:21,834
- Really?
- No, they need Do.

1068
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:24,333
- No.
- That's why you…

1069
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,300
- No.
- You need a Do.

1070
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:26,600
I don't understand.

1071
00:51:26,633 --> 00:51:27,567
You said it earlier.

1072
00:51:27,633 --> 00:51:28,667
When?

1073
00:51:28,734 --> 00:51:29,600
Hey.

1074
00:51:29,667 --> 00:51:31,800
Check the data!

1075
00:51:31,867 --> 00:51:32,767
Check the "data"?

1076
00:51:32,834 --> 00:51:36,533
- What?
- Goodbye.

1077
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:38,367
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1078
00:51:40,367 --> 00:51:42,867
"Check the data?"

1079
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:44,166
Goodbye.

1080
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,900
Nice!

1081
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:50,734
Nice!

1082
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:54,867
Team Employees won the boss' liquor
and the gift from the crew.

1083
00:51:54,934 --> 00:51:57,600
Thank you.

1084
00:51:57,667 --> 00:51:58,533
What is it?

1085
00:51:58,600 --> 00:52:00,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1086
00:52:00,467 --> 00:52:02,700
Tae Hyung didn't say much, for sure,

1087
00:52:02,767 --> 00:52:05,467
but Seo Jin kept throwing Gae too.

1088
00:52:06,834 --> 00:52:08,066
Gaes, Dos, and Back Dos.

1089
00:52:08,133 --> 00:52:10,233
I didn't even get Geol.

1090
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,967
I almost said Mr. Gae.

1091
00:52:13,033 --> 00:52:14,633
I almost said it. "Mister…"

1092
00:52:15,867 --> 00:52:17,233
Good work, everyone.

1093
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,700
- Good work.
- Great work.

1094
00:52:25,567 --> 00:52:28,700
A city in Mexico called Bacalar.

1095
00:52:28,767 --> 00:52:30,300
- Bacalar?
- Bacalar?

1096
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:31,700
I've never heard of it.

1097
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:35,166
Bacalar. I just saw it.

1098
00:52:44,367 --> 00:52:46,333
This is all a lake?

1099
00:52:56,233 --> 00:52:57,433
Let's get out.

1100
00:53:05,667 --> 00:53:06,433
Seo Jun.

1101
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,467
- This is my area.
- This is so cool.

1102
00:53:08,533 --> 00:53:09,600
This place is amazing.

1103
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:11,767
This place is huge.

1104
00:53:11,834 --> 00:53:14,467
- You can do whatever you want.
- This is amazing.

1105
00:53:14,533 --> 00:53:15,900
There's no one.

1106
00:53:15,967 --> 00:53:17,333
The street is empty.

1107
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:19,100
- It's raining.
- Huh?

1108
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:22,033
Why does it have to rain so much
on our first day?

1109
00:53:29,567 --> 00:53:30,667
Are you open?

1110
00:53:30,734 --> 00:53:32,166
- We're open.
- Woo-hoo!

1111
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:37,934
It's a dog.

1112
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,300
A dog came in.

1113
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:43,200
No.

1114
00:53:44,066 --> 00:53:45,033
Aww.

1115
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,567
What's it doing?

1116
00:54:09,133 --> 00:54:10,567
I washed these dishes.

1117
00:54:10,633 --> 00:54:11,967
Well done.

1118
00:54:14,567 --> 00:54:16,800
Ponga la salsa.

1119
00:54:20,567 --> 00:54:23,300
I feel like running a snack bar
all by myself.

1120
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,600
I'm going to be a master of gimbap.

1121
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,600
Business is not easy.

1122
00:54:43,734 --> 00:54:45,700
- Hello.
- Hello.

1123
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,467
Hey, hi!

1124
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:55,266
- It's her birthday.
- Oh, really? Happy birthday.

1125
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,900
Macho macho man

1126
00:54:59,533 --> 00:55:03,533
Hey, you guys kept your promise.

1127
00:55:15,266 --> 00:55:16,133
Do you speak Spanish?

1128
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,033
Yes.

1129
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,100
We'd like to hear about
your dining experience here.

1130
00:55:20,633 --> 00:55:21,567
You say it.

1131
00:55:21,633 --> 00:55:22,633
Okay.

1132
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:24,300
We want to hear from you both.

1133
00:55:25,533 --> 00:55:28,467
You went in separately,

1134
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:32,133
but you came out together.

1135
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,333
- Right.
- You're friends already.

1136
00:55:39,266 --> 00:55:40,633
Is it closed?

1137
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:42,000
We're opening at 2 PM.

1138
00:55:42,133 --> 00:55:44,266
Okay, we'll wait.

1139
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,066
Did you like the food?

1140
00:55:50,133 --> 00:55:51,533
Yes, it was very good.

1141
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,700
What did you like the most?

1142
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:54,600
Gim…

1143
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:56,166
- Gimbap.
- Yes, gimbap.

1144
00:55:57,734 --> 00:55:59,166
It's a little bit spicy.

1145
00:55:59,233 --> 00:56:00,266
I wanna try.

1146
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:01,967
We're Mexicans.

1147
00:56:02,033 --> 00:56:03,667
It's really spicy.

1148
00:56:03,734 --> 00:56:05,266
Are you Mexican?

1149
00:56:08,166 --> 00:56:12,033
Actually, my husband is Italian
and I'm Mexican.

1150
00:56:16,433 --> 00:56:17,900
It was delicious.

1151
00:56:17,967 --> 00:56:19,834
It was a little spicy,

1152
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,667
but I'm good with spicy, so it was okay.

1153
00:56:29,967 --> 00:56:31,500
What did you order?

1154
00:56:31,567 --> 00:56:33,600
Some spicy noodles.

1155
00:56:33,667 --> 00:56:35,667
And a tater dog.

1156
00:56:35,734 --> 00:56:37,200
The water too.

1157
00:56:37,266 --> 00:56:38,600
It was a little spicy.

1158
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:42,400
I ordered the spicy fricken.

1159
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,834
Mmm.

1160
00:56:44,433 --> 00:56:46,567
- Was it delicious?
- Yes, it was delicious.

1161
00:56:46,633 --> 00:56:47,967
Oh, and the dessert too.

1162
00:56:48,033 --> 00:56:49,333
Right, the dessert.

1163
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,934
It was really good.

1164
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,333
We should ask that.

1165
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,600
What is that dessert called?

1166
00:56:55,667 --> 00:56:57,066
- Yakgwa.
- Yakgwa.

1167
00:56:58,667 --> 00:57:03,467
I usually like sweet and salty combos.

1168
00:57:03,533 --> 00:57:06,500
So I ordered the half & half corn dog,

1169
00:57:06,567 --> 00:57:07,867
and I almost died.

1170
00:57:07,934 --> 00:57:08,900
Excuse me?

1171
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:11,133
It was so good.

1172
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,834
How did you know
there was a Korean restaurant here?

1173
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,633
A friend told me yesterday.

1174
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:19,066
We're also running a restaurant
in Bacalar.

1175
00:57:19,967 --> 00:57:27,200
Do you think we could be your rival?

1176
00:57:28,233 --> 00:57:31,734
You could be our café's rival.

1177
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,633
How did you know about our restaurant?

1178
00:57:33,633 --> 00:57:39,066
We live near Bacalar,
so we come here often to swim.

1179
00:57:39,133 --> 00:57:41,100
We found the restaurant while walking by.

1180
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:44,467
Korean food is really popular these days,
so I wanted to try it.

1181
00:57:47,333 --> 00:57:51,400
I saw a queue while walking by.

1182
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,834
I thought there must be a reason for it.

1183
00:57:53,867 --> 00:57:57,100
We like walking around.
We found this place

1184
00:57:57,166 --> 00:57:59,133
while we were taking a walk.

1185
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,967
- No.
- The smell.

1186
00:58:02,033 --> 00:58:04,867
We smelled something delicious
while walking.

1187
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:12,633
The Netherlands just lost
the World Cup quarterfinals.

1188
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:15,400
So we needed some nice food.

1189
00:58:15,467 --> 00:58:17,900
So we came back. We really liked the food.

1190
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,567
It was nice to eat something different.

1191
00:58:20,633 --> 00:58:23,567
As soon as someone told me
there was a Korean restaurant here,

1192
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:25,734
I thought, "I gotta go."

1193
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,767
I'd already eaten,

1194
00:58:26,834 --> 00:58:28,533
but I could fit more Korean in.

1195
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,600
There's just no Asian food here.
It's very rare.

1196
00:58:31,667 --> 00:58:35,367
We didn't think we'd come to Mexico
and have Korean food.

1197
00:58:35,433 --> 00:58:37,133
But it's been so lovely.

1198
00:58:38,767 --> 00:58:41,000
Does he have restaurants in Korea?

1199
00:58:41,066 --> 00:58:42,467
No, he's an actor.

1200
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:45,066
He's an actor?

1201
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,900
- We thought he was the owner.
- They're actors and actresses.

1202
00:58:47,934 --> 00:58:49,367
Even the one who cooked?

1203
00:58:49,433 --> 00:58:51,200
Yes, everyone.

1204
00:58:52,867 --> 00:58:55,867
Oh, they're all stars
but trained themselves to work here.

1205
00:58:56,867 --> 00:58:58,600
I'm an Army.

1206
00:58:58,667 --> 00:59:01,166
Until the day I die.

1207
00:59:01,233 --> 00:59:02,767
That's why you came here to eat.

1208
00:59:02,767 --> 00:59:05,934
Yes, I told my husband
I wanted to see Tae Hyung alone

1209
00:59:05,934 --> 00:59:06,967
so he shouldn't come.

1210
00:59:08,533 --> 00:59:13,233
You're the only customers
who came three times.

1211
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:17,867
What made you come three times?

1212
00:59:17,934 --> 00:59:19,433
Because it's new food to us,

1213
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:24,767
and we knew you were here
only temporarily and leaving soon.

1214
00:59:24,834 --> 00:59:28,333
But even if the restaurant stayed,

1215
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:31,734
we would've come regularly too.

1216
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:35,233
Among all the ramyeons I've tried,
yours was the best.

1217
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:40,500
Is this your last day?

1218
00:59:40,567 --> 00:59:42,900
- Yes, it's our last day.
- That's so short.

1219
00:59:42,967 --> 00:59:45,633
You should come back
to open an actual restaurant.

1220
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,734
Right? Someday, yeah.

1221
00:59:51,233 --> 00:59:53,667
- When will this place be full?
- Huh?

1222
00:59:53,734 --> 00:59:54,967
Will it ever be full?

1223
00:59:56,734 --> 00:59:59,133
We have no table now. No tables.

1224
01:00:01,233 --> 01:00:02,300
Hello!

1225
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:04,133
Was everything good?

1226
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:19,200
We hit it.

1227
01:00:19,266 --> 01:00:20,166
What did we get?

1228
01:00:20,233 --> 01:00:21,467
Spicy pork gimbap.

1229
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:23,367
That's great.

1230
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,700
Are you practicing?

1231
01:00:27,767 --> 01:00:29,300
- No.
- You're going home tomorrow.

1232
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:37,400
Are they for your fans?

1233
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,467
Yes.

1234
01:00:39,333 --> 01:00:40,934
Let's use all of them.

1235
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,133
I'll make some too.

1236
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,667
Thank you.

1237
01:01:12,467 --> 01:01:13,567
Here.

1238
01:01:13,633 --> 01:01:15,567
Thank you.

1239
01:01:16,834 --> 01:01:20,767
It's my appreciation
for being so respectful and orderly.

1240
01:01:44,467 --> 01:01:48,000
Remember me

1241
01:01:48,066 --> 01:01:50,233
Though I…

1242
01:01:54,433 --> 01:01:57,333
Remember me

1243
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:18,500
Me

1244
01:02:18,567 --> 01:02:20,133
Me

1245
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:22,867
Me

1246
01:02:28,834 --> 01:02:32,100
Remember me

1247
01:02:32,166 --> 01:02:35,700
Though I have to say goodbye

1248
01:02:41,033 --> 01:02:45,433
Remember me

1249
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,667
Remember me

1250
01:02:51,967 --> 01:02:55,000
Remember

1251
01:02:56,500 --> 01:03:03,400
Me

1252
01:03:05,433 --> 01:03:07,533
Thank you.

1253
01:03:07,567 --> 01:03:08,767
What a great performance.

1254
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:55,066
