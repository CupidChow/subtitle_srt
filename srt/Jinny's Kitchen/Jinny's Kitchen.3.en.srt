00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:25,767
JINNY'S KITCHEN

2
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,367
-We can open at two, right?
-Yes, of course.

3
00:00:29,066 --> 00:00:30,734
Hello. How are you?

4
00:00:30,767 --> 00:00:33,066
We already have customers.

5
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,500
Hello.

6
00:00:34,567 --> 00:00:36,033
We got more customers.

7
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:37,066
-Bulgogi?
-Yes.

8
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:39,533
-Bulgogi.
-Gimbap.

9
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,166
This is not good.

10
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,300
No, they ordered one.

11
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:43,633
No, it's written two.

12
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:48,667
I'm scared.

13
00:00:49,066 --> 00:00:51,233
Yu Mi can't seem to handle all the orders.

14
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:53,533
Jinny's Kitchen.

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,734
Oh!

16
00:00:56,033 --> 00:00:58,066
-Woo Shik, go to the kitchen.
-All right.

17
00:00:59,266 --> 00:01:01,667
-So many customers.
-Come on.

18
00:01:04,533 --> 00:01:06,600
We got two more customers.

19
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:14,633
-Thank you.
-Okay.

20
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,300
-Cheese ramyeon?
-Yes.

21
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:24,767
Tuna for the Black Buddha.

22
00:01:26,266 --> 00:01:27,600
-This sauce is spicy.
-Okay.

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,600
I like spicy. It's okay.

24
00:01:30,667 --> 00:01:32,500
Two originals.

25
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:45,000
Original?

26
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,433
-Here.
-Thank you.

27
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:48,033
Thank you.

28
00:01:48,066 --> 00:01:51,433
That looks pretty good. Thank you.

29
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:56,300
-It looks pretty, doesn't it?
-Yeah.

30
00:02:15,633 --> 00:02:17,433
Take it.

31
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:24,567
-Tasty, right?
-Yeah.

32
00:02:32,266 --> 00:02:33,367
Very good.

33
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:37,633
What's that thing in there? Eggs?

34
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,266
Oh, it's cheese.

35
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,233
Coming here was a very good idea.

36
00:02:45,066 --> 00:02:46,300
Yeah, it was.

37
00:02:47,533 --> 00:02:49,000
The best food I had.

38
00:02:49,033 --> 00:02:49,767
Sorry?

39
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:51,467
It's the best food ever.

40
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:07,700
It has really nice flavor.

41
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:09,200
Yeah, it's good.

42
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,433
Is it good with the cheese?

43
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,633
What kind of cheese is it?

44
00:03:16,233 --> 00:03:17,433
An American slice.

45
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:19,500
That's what they do in Korea.

46
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:22,300
We've never been to Korea.

47
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:25,000
I've watched the convenience stores
in Korea.

48
00:03:25,567 --> 00:03:27,100
Where?

49
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:30,100
From a video clip
about convenience stores in Korea.

50
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:33,100
They have hot water and stuff.

51
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:35,400
-And they add cheese.
-Like instant noodles?

52
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,266
Yeah.

53
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:46,767
I'm actually so happy about this.

54
00:04:01,266 --> 00:04:03,567
Hola. Are you open?

55
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:05,367
Yes, come in.

56
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,033
Should we order something to share?

57
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,400
Yeah. Let's share the food.

58
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:14,133
We'll get one cheese tteokbokki...

59
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,133
It's spicy. Is that okay?

60
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,500
Is it very spicy?

61
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:19,533
No, just a little bit.

62
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,367
-A little bit.
-Is that okay?

63
00:04:22,033 --> 00:04:24,333
-One cheese ramyeon?
-Yes, thank you.

64
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,400
Half-and-half potato corn dog.

65
00:04:27,734 --> 00:04:31,200
-I'll take water.
-Two Cokes.

66
00:04:31,367 --> 00:04:32,300
One Sprite?

67
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:36,300
What's gimbap?

68
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:37,667
This is gimbap.

69
00:04:41,266 --> 00:04:42,567
It looks tasty.

70
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,133
Do you wanna try it?

71
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,333
Let's try bulgogi gimbap.

72
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:52,300
-Okay. That's it?
-That's it.

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,600
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

74
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:59,033
Is it okay to sit here?

75
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,667
Take this to your table.

76
00:05:07,467 --> 00:05:09,400
Thank you.

77
00:05:11,533 --> 00:05:12,734
Happy birthday.

78
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,400
I hope you like it.

79
00:05:23,066 --> 00:05:25,367
It'll look good
with the necklace I gave you.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,367
I got a heart necklace from her.

81
00:05:32,066 --> 00:05:33,066
Take a photo.

82
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:48,333
-It's her birthday.
-Oh, really?

83
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,100
Happy birthday.

84
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,200
Thank you.

85
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,367
We're on fire today.

86
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:54,300
Gracias.

87
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,500
Give this to Tae Hyung.

88
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:05,133
Tae Hyung.

89
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:29,100
Purple Buddha's bulgogi.

90
00:07:38,266 --> 00:07:40,600
-This one is a spicy sauce.
-Okay.

91
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:42,166
And this one?

92
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:45,567
-That's not spicy.
-Okay.

93
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,600
-Chopsticks?
-Thank you.

94
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:51,433
Those chopsticks are flat. They look nice.

95
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:54,133
I'm not good with chopsticks.

96
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,433
You have a fork too.

97
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,433
Can I use it?

98
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:00,533
I can't.

99
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,533
It looks so good.

100
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,667
It's so good.

101
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,300
I love the gimbap.

102
00:08:32,734 --> 00:08:35,033
Gimbap is my favorite.

103
00:08:38,133 --> 00:08:40,667
Do you need small plates?

104
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:42,367
Please. Thank you.

105
00:08:58,734 --> 00:09:01,367
-What's this?
-It's tteokbokki.

106
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:05,133
Can you show us? Yes.

107
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,467
It looks so good.

108
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,200
-What is it exactly?
-It's rice cake.

109
00:09:14,266 --> 00:09:16,233
Oh, rice cake.

110
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:21,400
Should we stir it
so it mixes with the cheese?

111
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,767
I think we should.

112
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,100
It's really good.

113
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:43,533
It's so good.

114
00:09:47,767 --> 00:09:50,266
-It's really good.
-It is indeed.

115
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:05,400
It's almost too good.

116
00:10:05,433 --> 00:10:07,533
This cheese is really good.

117
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,433
The cheese tastes amazing.

118
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:17,166
-It's good, right?
-It's sweet. It's so good.

119
00:10:22,633 --> 00:10:24,467
Do you want me to finish yours?

120
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:30,367
It's good.

121
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:31,767
You finished the whole bowl.

122
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,367
Are we coming back here tomorrow?

123
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:42,133
We should have some Mexican food too.

124
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:44,300
I wanna eat here again.

125
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:48,266
It's the best place I've ever been.

126
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,066
I love having a glass of wine
with the food.

127
00:10:54,767 --> 00:10:57,734
Do you think they have
that food made with lots of garlic?

128
00:10:57,734 --> 00:11:00,700
-You know, the charming Korean...
-You mean kimchi?

129
00:11:04,467 --> 00:11:05,500
How was the food?

130
00:11:06,066 --> 00:11:07,100
Perfect.

131
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,700
Do you have kimchi?

132
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,333
-Kimchi...
-Kimchi.

133
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,166
If you come back tomorrow,
I'll get it ready.

134
00:11:14,033 --> 00:11:15,667
-Yea?
-Next time.

135
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,500
-I will prepare kimchi.
-Okay.

136
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:27,000
How have you been?

137
00:11:27,667 --> 00:11:29,433
What took you so long?

138
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,266
-Woo Shik.
-Yes.

139
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,700
Take this to the gentlemen.

140
00:11:33,166 --> 00:11:34,133
With the tray.

141
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,367
-What is it?
-A dessert.

142
00:11:35,433 --> 00:11:39,066
-Dessert?
-Yes, just on the house.

143
00:11:41,633 --> 00:11:42,700
Hello, sir.

144
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,066
This is Korean traditional candy.

145
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,100
-Okay.
-For dessert.

146
00:11:49,567 --> 00:11:51,667
What is it? A candy?

147
00:11:52,533 --> 00:11:55,133
It looks candied and shiny.

148
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:05,500
It's good.

149
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,000
Is it good?

150
00:12:08,066 --> 00:12:09,200
It's good.

151
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,100
-Shall we go?
-Yea.

152
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,000
Are we going to the water?

153
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,166
Yeah.

154
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:23,133
Thank you.

155
00:12:23,166 --> 00:12:24,300
Thank you.

156
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,533
Go ask if they like the food.

157
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:36,100
That's your role.

158
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:40,400
Is everything okay?

159
00:12:40,467 --> 00:12:42,100
Yes, thank you.

160
00:13:00,133 --> 00:13:02,000
-I wanna drink the broth.
-Huh?

161
00:13:02,066 --> 00:13:04,266
Go ahead. Drink it.

162
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,367
It's really good.

163
00:13:20,567 --> 00:13:23,400
It's good. There's egg inside.

164
00:13:23,633 --> 00:13:25,600
I'm really full now.

165
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:28,533
This was a great meal.

166
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:31,600
I'm going to leave 50 pesos.

167
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:49,433
Aren't you tired?

168
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,467
-Are you tired?
-Yeah.

169
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:55,734
-Tired, huh?
-Yeah.

170
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,000
You're not so cranky today.

171
00:13:58,066 --> 00:14:00,166
When was I cranky?

172
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,133
You look so benevolent.

173
00:14:02,433 --> 00:14:03,600
How much did we make?

174
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:04,767
Oh, that's a lot.

175
00:14:06,433 --> 00:14:09,033
-You're really happy too.
-I mean...

176
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,300
That's triple more.

177
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,400
We made 5,300 pesos.

178
00:14:12,667 --> 00:14:14,233
It was 1,800 yesterday.

179
00:14:18,667 --> 00:14:20,633
Go get ready for tomorrow.

180
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,233
We must marinate the beef.

181
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:24,433
You should teach Woo Shik how to do it.

182
00:14:24,467 --> 00:14:26,433
Show him how to do it.

183
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:28,700
-Intern Choi, sit.
-Okay.

184
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,033
You answer me with "Yes, sir."

185
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,300
One cup of soy sauce.

186
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,300
What are you doing?

187
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,400
Go get it.

188
00:14:40,533 --> 00:14:41,700
Oh, right.

189
00:14:50,233 --> 00:14:52,333
Treat it like a baby. Be gentle.

190
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,467
You'll ruin it.

191
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,400
As if you're putting a baby to sleep.

192
00:14:58,467 --> 00:15:00,333
Come on. Put the baby to sleep.

193
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:04,166
Rock-a-bye baby...

194
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,467
There's more meat on this pan.

195
00:15:07,533 --> 00:15:10,400
They won't taste the same then.

196
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,300
Cook it all together.

197
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,000
Yes, Chef.

198
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,133
What do we do with the dog?

199
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,734
Just leave it. We can't help it.

200
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,266
When did it come in?

201
00:15:29,734 --> 00:15:31,734
I bet it's gonna come every day.

202
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,333
Look, it's lying down.

203
00:15:37,033 --> 00:15:39,667
-Let's go.
-It's following you.

204
00:15:44,367 --> 00:15:46,500
It's saying bye to him.

205
00:15:46,734 --> 00:15:48,633
Look at its tail.

206
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,667
We should...

207
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,600
We should give him a uniform too.

208
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,633
Please leave now. We're closed.

209
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,333
-Name the dog.
-Yea?

210
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:02,533
Like what?

211
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:06,734
Seo Jin.

212
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,533
Seo Jin.

213
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:14,333
Seo Jin.

214
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,233
Unbelievable.

215
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:20,033
Seo Jin, you have the same name.
How funny is that?

216
00:16:21,066 --> 00:16:23,533
Woo Shik. Its name is Seo Jin.

217
00:16:23,567 --> 00:16:24,667
Hey, Seo Jin, out.

218
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:29,300
Stop calling it Seo Jin.

219
00:16:29,367 --> 00:16:31,367
Is this why we're Jinny's Kitchen?

220
00:16:34,567 --> 00:16:35,667
Seo Jin, get out.

221
00:16:36,367 --> 00:16:38,033
Don't. It's our guard dog.

222
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,266
Seo Jin. Keep watch.

223
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:43,200
This is your turf, got it?

224
00:16:43,734 --> 00:16:45,066
See you tomorrow.

225
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,467
See you.

226
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,467
Welcome!

227
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,033
This house is huge.

228
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,266
Wow, these are chunks of pork belly.

229
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:03,033
Is it really smokeless?

230
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,533
There's a fan attached.

231
00:17:08,734 --> 00:17:10,367
It sucks up the smoke.

232
00:17:10,433 --> 00:17:12,133
It is sucking the smoke in.

233
00:17:12,734 --> 00:17:15,033
Goodness, it looks great.

234
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:21,166
-Congratulations, Boss.
-Hold that tight.

235
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,433
-Boss.
-Congratulations.

236
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,300
-To the success of Jinny's Kitchen!
-Success!

237
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,667
Gosh, this is good.

238
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:34,500
I hadn't had pork so long.

239
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,533
Good, huh?

240
00:17:42,433 --> 00:17:44,033
It's so good.

241
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:46,467
-You want soup?
-I'm getting tipsy.

242
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:48,633
Esta... piripi.

243
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,100
Does that mean tipsy?

244
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,734
"Piripi" means tipsy.

245
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,633
-Really?
-You just made that up.

246
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,100
I didn't.

247
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,233
Gosh, I'm so tipsy.

248
00:18:00,266 --> 00:18:01,700
Gosh, piripi.

249
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:03,700
When it gets bad, it's piripiriparapo.

250
00:18:06,433 --> 00:18:07,767
You're lying again.

251
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:14,367
By the way, Woo Shik,
could you say this when you take orders?

252
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,433
Say what?

253
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,133
You know, gimbap and ramyeon are
often ordered together in snack bars.

254
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,066
Or gimbap and tteokbokki.

255
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,633
-Tell them they're Korean combo meals.
-Combo.

256
00:18:32,333 --> 00:18:35,367
-I'm thinking of adding combo menus.
-What?

257
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:37,400
To provide a cheaper deal?

258
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,533
So they can try different menus.

259
00:18:39,567 --> 00:18:41,367
Then let's make combo meals.

260
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,300
Gimbap and ramyeon at a cheaper price.

261
00:18:45,367 --> 00:18:47,200
Tteokbokki and gimbap.

262
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:49,066
Tteokbokki goes well with gimbap.

263
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,166
How about we call them Jinny's Combo?

264
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,600
Jinny's Combo!

265
00:19:00,066 --> 00:19:03,033
Anyway, tomorrow is a weekend.

266
00:19:03,066 --> 00:19:06,333
We'll be busy. We should add more menus.

267
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:08,667
Let's sell spicy fried chicken.

268
00:19:08,734 --> 00:19:10,767
-Spicy fried chicken?
-Yes.

269
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,333
People love chicken no matter what.

270
00:19:13,533 --> 00:19:16,367
-You should go with Seo Jin.
-Sure.

271
00:19:17,367 --> 00:19:20,033
It's my restaurant.
I must see my own chicken.

272
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,500
"You're my chicken!"

273
00:19:30,367 --> 00:19:34,233
You feel responsible
for your own show, huh?

274
00:20:57,467 --> 00:21:00,734
-Friend.
-Friend.

275
00:21:00,767 --> 00:21:02,166
Good morning.

276
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,266
Good morning.

277
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,500
Gray today?

278
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:18,066
-All right. Are you ready?
-Let's go.

279
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:20,300
Let's go.

280
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,367
-Go get the car. I'll look out for you.
-Okay.

281
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,133
Pollo? Pollo...

282
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:48,166
There's a store here.

283
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,133
-Hola.
-Hola.

284
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,600
Do you want to remove the bones?

285
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,633
Of course.

286
00:21:56,533 --> 00:21:58,200
No bones.

287
00:21:58,266 --> 00:22:00,100
Chicken breast?

288
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,734
How many?

289
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,100
How many should we buy?

290
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:09,500
-Three.
-Three?

291
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:10,600
Three.

292
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:13,100
Should we buy some chicken thighs too?

293
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,066
Un kilo.One kilogram, right?

294
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:19,367
-Let's mix them before we cook.
-Okay.

295
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:22,500
I bet chicken will be
the bestseller today.

296
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,367
She's really good.

297
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:31,133
Muy bien.

298
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,767
What's your name?

299
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,500
My name? Ingrid.

300
00:22:37,567 --> 00:22:39,633
-Ingrid?
-Yes, Ingrid.

301
00:22:40,266 --> 00:22:43,467
Bonito nombre.

302
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,233
-Thank you.
-Pretty name.

303
00:22:46,066 --> 00:22:48,400
Bonito...

304
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,667
-Gracias.
-Gracias.

305
00:22:54,066 --> 00:22:57,033
Let's get a pineapple for us.

306
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:01,400
We'd like to get a good, big pineapple.

307
00:23:02,133 --> 00:23:04,400
-Gracias.
-Gracias.

308
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:07,100
- Right, they wanted some coffee.
-Yes.

309
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:30,367
-Tres...
-Iced Americano.

310
00:23:39,266 --> 00:23:41,700
A Korean restaurant.

311
00:23:42,033 --> 00:23:45,266
A Korean restaurant? In Bacalar?

312
00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,367
We just opened.

313
00:23:47,433 --> 00:23:49,266
-Oh, you just opened.
-Yes.

314
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:53,400
-It's near the lake.
-Okay.

315
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:56,400
-This side? Or the other side?
-This side.

316
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:57,367
-This side?
-Yes.

317
00:23:57,533 --> 00:24:00,133
You should come. We'll give you good food.

318
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,100
-Thank you.
-Sure. Just come.

319
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,000
HARD WORKERS = HAPPY BOSS

320
00:24:05,033 --> 00:24:07,533
-We'll visit your place.
-Okay.

321
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,533
-Thank you for your invitation.
-Thank you.

322
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:13,633
Thank you.

323
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,200
Buenas tardes.

324
00:24:19,233 --> 00:24:22,266
-Buenas tardes.
-Buenas tardes.

325
00:24:22,767 --> 00:24:24,033
Buenas tardes.

326
00:24:24,066 --> 00:24:25,467
Buenas tardes.

327
00:24:26,233 --> 00:24:28,367
-Wow, so hot.
-Hot, very hot.

328
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,667
-Tae Hyung, let's do this.
-Let's do this.

329
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,567
I can do this.

330
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,367
Hola.

331
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:45,567
-For me?
-Yes.

332
00:24:45,633 --> 00:24:48,300
Really? Is it really mine?

333
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,233
Are you serious?

334
00:24:52,066 --> 00:24:54,133
Seriously, I can't believe
you got me this...

335
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,200
As if I never bought you anything.

336
00:24:58,467 --> 00:25:00,300
What did you buy?

337
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,166
-Our dessert.
-A pineapple.

338
00:25:02,166 --> 00:25:03,333
I bought a pineapple.

339
00:25:03,367 --> 00:25:05,433
Wow, Boss!

340
00:25:08,333 --> 00:25:09,700
What happened to him?

341
00:25:24,767 --> 00:25:26,567
Add the spring onions now.

342
00:25:59,633 --> 00:26:02,300
Wait. What's going on here?

343
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:03,233
Is this normal?

344
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,100
It's the rice. Did you do it right?

345
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:06,200
-Yes.
-Is this right?

346
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,233
Does this always happen
when cooking rice?

347
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,166
Is this normal?

348
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,667
-He's so scared.
-The steam from rice...

349
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,533
Are you sure?

350
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:23,400
Seo Jun, how long does the prep take?

351
00:26:23,433 --> 00:26:25,233
-I'm done.
-You're done?

352
00:26:25,266 --> 00:26:27,266
The fritters and everything?

353
00:26:27,333 --> 00:26:29,367
They only take five minutes.

354
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,300
Five minutes? Okay.

355
00:26:31,367 --> 00:26:33,633
Can we open at 2 o'clock then?

356
00:26:33,667 --> 00:26:35,000
Yes, we can.

357
00:26:59,533 --> 00:27:02,000
I'll take care of it. You eat this.

358
00:27:02,066 --> 00:27:03,200
I'll do it.

359
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,533
-I think it's good with salt.
-I'll check.

360
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,633
Take this.

361
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:12,333
It's tasty.

362
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,767
It's so good.

363
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,266
Good.

364
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:34,667
Nah, this won't do.

365
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,734
I'll do it.
Could you make the sauce instead?

366
00:27:41,767 --> 00:27:43,400
-Sure.
-Good.

367
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:51,734
We don't have a funnel, so...

368
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:02,700
You look so cool.

369
00:28:04,066 --> 00:28:06,700
This is...

370
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:08,734
why I shouldn't teach him.

371
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:15,166
-Ooh, Choi Woo Shik.
-Nice job.

372
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,367
Looks like your baking experience
from last summer is paying off now.

373
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:24,200
You're good.

374
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,000
Gee...

375
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:28,000
That's all from experience.

376
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:31,166
Tae Hyung seemed worried yesterday.

377
00:28:31,233 --> 00:28:34,633
He said Woo Shik might outshine him.

378
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,567
-Tenderloin.
-Yes, nice.

379
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,000
-Chicken tenderloin.
-Yes.

380
00:28:57,667 --> 00:28:59,433
-Pour it in.
-Pour it.

381
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,433
Mix it well.

382
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,467
-Let's switch.
-Okay.

383
00:29:08,533 --> 00:29:10,767
-Add all of it?
-Sure.

384
00:29:25,433 --> 00:29:27,066
We should sell this.

385
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,500
Right, that what we're doing.

386
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,633
Yes, it's totally worth selling it.

387
00:29:57,066 --> 00:29:58,333
There we go.

388
00:30:05,433 --> 00:30:07,667
-Is it okay?
-How interesting.

389
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:11,100
It's just like the sauce
from fried chicken restaurants.

390
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:20,333
-Only 20 minutes left.
-Yes, sir.

391
00:30:21,233 --> 00:30:23,300
-We got 20 minutes left.
-Okay.

392
00:30:23,367 --> 00:30:25,100
Yu Mi, we got 20 minutes left.

393
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,734
Hello.

394
00:30:31,734 --> 00:30:33,066
Hello.

395
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,367
Are you closed?

396
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:36,033
We open at two.

397
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,200
You open at two? Okay.

398
00:30:39,066 --> 00:30:41,333
Okay. We'll wait.

399
00:30:57,667 --> 00:30:58,633
That's it.

400
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:08,400
Okay.

401
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,333
It's frying.

402
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,734
I'll put them in the oil.

403
00:31:13,567 --> 00:31:15,734
You just have to separate them

404
00:31:15,767 --> 00:31:17,600
-so they don't stick together.
-Okay.

405
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:27,000
Check the color
and take out the ones that look done.

406
00:31:27,333 --> 00:31:29,200
-Like these?
-Yes.

407
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,367
Are you all ready?

408
00:31:35,433 --> 00:31:36,333
-Seo Jun.
-Yes.

409
00:31:36,367 --> 00:31:37,500
Are you ready?

410
00:31:37,533 --> 00:31:39,400
-Can we open?
-We're getting ready.

411
00:31:39,467 --> 00:31:40,734
Can we open?

412
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:42,433
People are waiting outside.

413
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:46,300
-Well...
-The chicken isn't ready yet.

414
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,266
What time is it now?

415
00:31:50,734 --> 00:31:52,133
We got about 10 minutes.

416
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:56,333
Let's tell them we open at two
but they can wait inside.

417
00:31:59,533 --> 00:32:01,533
-How is it going?
-Good.

418
00:32:06,734 --> 00:32:08,433
Do you wanna come in?

419
00:32:09,367 --> 00:32:13,400
We open at two, so you can wait
for ten minutes. Is that okay?

420
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,066
Okay, come in.

421
00:32:18,667 --> 00:32:20,600
Sit at any table you want. Hello.

422
00:32:35,266 --> 00:32:39,000
-We should take them out.
-Take out what?

423
00:32:39,066 --> 00:32:40,767
They got stuck.

424
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:50,734
You'll be done in ten, huh?

425
00:32:50,767 --> 00:32:52,233
Ten minutes...

426
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:54,200
It'll be tough,

427
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,033
but we'll make it work.

428
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,166
The chicken is the problem.
It's our first time, so...

429
00:33:02,667 --> 00:33:05,266
I see more people
on the street than yesterday.

430
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,667
I'm saying a lot more people.

431
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,600
These need to be more cooked.

432
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,266
Hello.

433
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,700
Hello.

434
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,467
We open at two.
Could you sit and wait until then?

435
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:16,233
Can I take orders?

436
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:20,200
-Can I take orders now?
-Yes.

437
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:21,400
How's the chicken?

438
00:34:21,467 --> 00:34:23,667
I'm frying it, but...

439
00:34:24,633 --> 00:34:28,100
The problem is that
I can't fry many pieces at the same time.

440
00:34:31,467 --> 00:34:32,500
Then...

441
00:34:48,567 --> 00:34:50,233
-Can I take orders?
-Yes.

442
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,567
Wanna come and order?

443
00:35:13,266 --> 00:35:15,300
I wanna have ramyeon.

444
00:35:15,367 --> 00:35:17,500
I'll take the original ramyeon.

445
00:35:17,567 --> 00:35:20,433
I'll take Combo One.
But instead of the original one,

446
00:35:20,467 --> 00:35:22,367
can I get cheese ramyeon?

447
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,300
You want cheese?

448
00:35:32,333 --> 00:35:34,400
Actually, no.

449
00:35:34,467 --> 00:35:37,700
But if you want, I'll do it for you.

450
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,567
Okay, Jinny's Combo.

451
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:41,300
-One?
-One.

452
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:43,533
Anything to drink?

453
00:35:43,633 --> 00:35:46,700
-Coke? Mineral water?
-Water.

454
00:35:47,066 --> 00:35:50,266
-Thank you. Do you need a receipt?
-No, it's okay.

455
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:56,567
-Would you like to order?
-Yes.

456
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,300
We'd like to have one tteokbokki,

457
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:03,433
one original corn dog,
and one chicken, please.

458
00:36:03,433 --> 00:36:04,700
-Chicken?
-Yes.

459
00:36:04,734 --> 00:36:06,233
Do you want wine?

460
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:09,266
If you're getting one, yes.

461
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:11,400
-Two white wines.
-Thank you.

462
00:36:18,567 --> 00:36:20,400
We got orders.

463
00:36:25,333 --> 00:36:26,300
Jinny's Combo...

464
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:28,367
Two ramyeons.

465
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:30,133
Jinny's Combo?

466
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:32,500
Seo Jin, what were
in Jinny's Combo A again?

467
00:36:32,533 --> 00:36:35,233
Jinny's Combo A had ramyeon.
What was Combo B?

468
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,433
B is with tteokbokki?

469
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,100
Got this.

470
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:08,767
I got this!

471
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,333
-Let's try it out today.
-We got an order.

472
00:37:58,433 --> 00:37:59,433
Yes, sir.

473
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:06,433
Tteobokki, corn dog... Chicken...

474
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:15,233
-Did we get a chicken order?
-Yes.

475
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,367
We got this.

476
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,600
-Tae Hyung.
-Yes?

477
00:38:23,667 --> 00:38:25,166
I'll show you what to do.

478
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:27,633
-You know we pre-fry the chicken.
-Yes.

479
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,066
What we do after that is

480
00:38:29,166 --> 00:38:31,300
to fry it again for about two minutes.

481
00:38:31,367 --> 00:38:34,433
Then mix it with the sauce
and boil it down.

482
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,500
-Woo Shik, the fritters...
-Yes?

483
00:38:38,567 --> 00:38:40,266
Just fry it for a minute.

484
00:38:40,266 --> 00:38:45,133
For the tteokbokki,
it's two rice cakes and a fish cake.

485
00:38:45,667 --> 00:38:47,500
-One minute?
-Yes.

486
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
What is this?

487
00:38:53,066 --> 00:38:55,367
I think it means we're waiting.

488
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:21,066
I should put it here.

489
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:25,734
Done.

490
00:39:27,266 --> 00:39:28,500
Look.

491
00:39:30,567 --> 00:39:32,000
-Water.
-Thank you.

492
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:34,433
With no ice, please?

493
00:39:34,433 --> 00:39:35,700
-No ice?
-No.

494
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,500
Okay.

495
00:39:47,667 --> 00:39:53,100
When they bring the food,
say, "Gamsahabnida."

496
00:39:53,166 --> 00:39:54,367
Gamsahabnida.

497
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,266
Am I saying it right? Gamsahabnida.

498
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:58,433
-Gamsam...
-Gamsa.

499
00:39:58,467 --> 00:40:01,066
Gamsa... Gamsahabnida.

500
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,734
Gamsahabnida.

501
00:40:09,567 --> 00:40:12,033
-Did I say that right?
-Yes.

502
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,033
Perfect.

503
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,767
I think ours are coming.

504
00:40:57,033 --> 00:40:58,266
Serve this first.

505
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,333
-Hi.
-Hi.

506
00:41:04,367 --> 00:41:07,100
-Cheese ramyeon?
-Yes, that's me.

507
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:10,367
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

508
00:41:13,767 --> 00:41:15,200
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

509
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,533
Gimbap?

510
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,633
Yes, here.

511
00:41:22,367 --> 00:41:24,200
This is the sauce for gimbap.

512
00:41:28,066 --> 00:41:29,333
What sauce is this?

513
00:41:34,133 --> 00:41:35,133
It's spicy.

514
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,300
It's perfect for me.

515
00:41:42,367 --> 00:41:43,600
The noodles are nice.

516
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:49,567
This is really good.

517
00:41:52,133 --> 00:41:53,133
It's really good.

518
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,767
It's so simple, but it tastes amazing.

519
00:42:08,033 --> 00:42:12,033
There are carrots and meat inside,
and it's so good.

520
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,433
Wanna try?

521
00:42:17,533 --> 00:42:19,533
I wish I could have this at home.

522
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,233
This is funny. It's really good.

523
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:25,433
I can have 50 of these.

524
00:42:36,066 --> 00:42:37,600
It goes well with the sauce.

525
00:42:40,166 --> 00:42:41,533
Very good.

526
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:48,166
-Is it hot?
-Yes, very.

527
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,633
It's a little spicy.

528
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:01,500
But it's okay.

529
00:43:11,333 --> 00:43:13,433
This cheese ramyeon is excellent.

530
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,600
I'm glad we came here.

531
00:43:15,633 --> 00:43:17,633
I'd definitely recommend this place.

532
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:21,333
Could you put
ten pieces of fried chicken here?

533
00:43:21,367 --> 00:43:24,166
Ten? I need to fry them again.
Give me one second.

534
00:43:25,433 --> 00:43:28,066
Can I take orders?

535
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,600
-Yes.
-What about the chicken?

536
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,667
Is that enough?

537
00:43:57,533 --> 00:43:59,433
I just realized, in the kitchen, I...

538
00:43:59,533 --> 00:44:02,533
I... I can't even talk... I mean...

539
00:44:03,367 --> 00:44:06,300
I see you really had no time to talk.

540
00:44:37,567 --> 00:44:40,300
After coating with the sauce...

541
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:50,600
Sprinkle this and then the parsley.

542
00:44:51,367 --> 00:44:52,533
This much is fine.

543
00:44:54,467 --> 00:44:55,567
All right.

544
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,266
For the sky Buddha.

545
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,166
-Chicken?
-Right. Thank you.

546
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,333
We'll share it. It's okay. Thank you.

547
00:45:09,567 --> 00:45:11,700
I haven't had radish in ages.

548
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:18,667
Yum.

549
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:21,133
Oh, I didn't take a photo.

550
00:45:21,166 --> 00:45:22,000
Oops.

551
00:45:25,367 --> 00:45:27,433
Mmm, yummy.

552
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,734
This one looks good.

553
00:45:40,033 --> 00:45:41,567
-Chicken?
-Yes.

554
00:45:42,233 --> 00:45:43,700
There are combo meals too.

555
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,233
Let's try a bit of everything.

556
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,133
I want to order this.

557
00:45:52,233 --> 00:45:54,166
Let's order that.

558
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,767
This one and this one.

559
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,166
-Gimbap...
-Gimbap, this one?

560
00:45:59,734 --> 00:46:01,100
Wine?

561
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,166
-Yeah, we have wine.
-Oh, okay.

562
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,500
-Two, please.
-Two white wines.

563
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:07,166
And two waters.

564
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,367
-That's it?
-Yes.

565
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,600
Here. Water.

566
00:46:32,133 --> 00:46:33,500
That's a lot of wine.

567
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:36,333
It's for the couple.

568
00:46:44,633 --> 00:46:46,467
Is everything okay?

569
00:46:46,767 --> 00:46:48,000
Is it too spicy?

570
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:49,400
-No, it's okay.
-It's okay.

571
00:46:49,533 --> 00:46:50,567
They're very good.

572
00:46:50,734 --> 00:46:52,266
Is everything okay?

573
00:46:52,433 --> 00:46:54,266
Very good.

574
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,367
Woo Shik.

575
00:47:03,433 --> 00:47:05,033
Come and help me.

576
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:07,633
-What?
-We'll do the rest.

577
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,734
-Could you wash the bowls real quick?
-Sure.

578
00:47:22,233 --> 00:47:24,133
Hey, an order.

579
00:47:29,467 --> 00:47:31,166
We got two combos.

580
00:47:31,233 --> 00:47:33,066
Combo B is tteokbokki.

581
00:47:33,166 --> 00:47:35,233
Anyway, both Combos have gimbap, right?

582
00:47:35,233 --> 00:47:37,100
Yes, you need to roll a new one.

583
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,000
Oh, and one spicy pork.

584
00:47:43,033 --> 00:47:45,633
I need to take some tteokbokki.

585
00:47:46,033 --> 00:47:49,367
-Was it three?
-No, two rice cakes and a fish cake.

586
00:48:38,567 --> 00:48:41,633
It's easier to eat if you cut them.

587
00:48:41,734 --> 00:48:43,066
Yea, sure.

588
00:48:47,166 --> 00:48:49,133
Sorry about that. It's slippery.

589
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,266
Cut them into small pieces
about this size.

590
00:48:53,333 --> 00:48:54,700
-Awesome. Thank you.
-Thanks.

591
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:58,500
The rice cake is really slippery.

592
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:05,700
Looks good. It's very hot though.

593
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,500
-Wanna try it?
-You go.

594
00:49:11,467 --> 00:49:13,667
I love these.

595
00:49:13,734 --> 00:49:16,367
They're like little gimbap but fried.

596
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,033
I should've waited a bit.

597
00:49:32,066 --> 00:49:33,533
It's hot.

598
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:40,567
Rice cake was my favorite food as a kid.

599
00:49:46,467 --> 00:49:47,734
It's really good.

600
00:49:50,233 --> 00:49:51,533
It's mandu.

601
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,266
Huh?

602
00:49:53,433 --> 00:49:55,467
-Mandu.
-Mandu.

603
00:50:26,567 --> 00:50:28,400
Two Combo plates.

604
00:50:31,433 --> 00:50:34,000
For the sauce... It's here.

605
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:37,767
Seo Jun.

606
00:50:38,033 --> 00:50:39,367
Seo Jun, ramyeon.

607
00:50:39,433 --> 00:50:40,433
Yeah, I'm on it.

608
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,633
The ramyeon bowl.

609
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,767
-Oh, you mean I can use it now.
-Yes.

610
00:50:44,033 --> 00:50:46,033
-I'll go take it when I need it.
-Okay.

611
00:50:57,567 --> 00:50:59,300
It's next to you.

612
00:51:02,667 --> 00:51:04,333
You don't have to add sauce.

613
00:51:08,734 --> 00:51:11,400
What is this? For the Combo?

614
00:51:11,433 --> 00:51:13,033
Tteokbokki for Combo B.

615
00:51:13,033 --> 00:51:14,734
But we have the other plate.

616
00:51:16,033 --> 00:51:17,467
-Then...
-It's in the picture.

617
00:51:17,467 --> 00:51:19,100
Let's use that after this.

618
00:51:19,133 --> 00:51:20,700
-And serve this as is?
-Yes.

619
00:51:31,367 --> 00:51:33,767
-Jinny's Combo?
-Combo B.

620
00:51:33,767 --> 00:51:34,700
Yes.

621
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:36,734
-It's a bit spicy.
-Which one is?

622
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,734
-It's kind of sweet too.
-Okay.

623
00:51:40,033 --> 00:51:41,066
I want to try.

624
00:51:41,166 --> 00:51:42,166
We're Mexican.

625
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:45,400
Use this, if it's too long...

626
00:51:51,166 --> 00:51:54,300
Why cut it with scissors?

627
00:51:54,367 --> 00:51:57,066
I suppose that's the way
you eat Korean street food.

628
00:51:57,133 --> 00:51:59,266
I want to try cutting it myself.

629
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,000
See how spicy it is.

630
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,300
I think it's too spicy for the kids.

631
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:16,533
Is it spicy?

632
00:52:22,033 --> 00:52:24,367
It's a little spicy.

633
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:29,400
I think it's okay without the sauce.
Do you wanna try it?

634
00:52:29,467 --> 00:52:30,400
Yes.

635
00:52:44,266 --> 00:52:46,066
It's so spicy.

636
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:54,467
It's too spicy.

637
00:52:54,500 --> 00:52:56,200
-Is it very spicy?
-Very.

638
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,166
Do you wanna try it too?

639
00:53:12,633 --> 00:53:15,266
You lied. It's spicy.

640
00:53:15,333 --> 00:53:18,400
Are you Mexican?

641
00:53:18,467 --> 00:53:21,400
I am, but...

642
00:53:25,166 --> 00:53:26,734
There's our Combo A.

643
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:41,367
Is it spicy?

644
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:45,367
-Just a bit.
-I don't want it.

645
00:53:45,433 --> 00:53:49,433
I think it's because your mouth
wasn't cooled down yet.

646
00:53:51,100 --> 00:53:52,400
Is it spicy?

647
00:53:56,533 --> 00:53:57,600
It's spicy.

648
00:54:02,467 --> 00:54:05,500
The boy can't eat it
because it's too spicy.

649
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:07,567
All these foods have chili inside.

650
00:54:07,633 --> 00:54:09,433
Then let's order the corn dog.

651
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,600
I want one too.

652
00:54:12,133 --> 00:54:14,166
We'd like to get this one.

653
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:16,166
Is it spicy?

654
00:54:16,233 --> 00:54:17,500
It's not spicy, is it?

655
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:19,233
No, it isn't.

656
00:54:38,166 --> 00:54:39,600
Very picante.

657
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:41,100
Is that spicy pork?

658
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,133
Seo Jun. One half-and-half tater dog.

659
00:55:48,667 --> 00:55:50,567
-It's spicy.
-Oh, okay.

660
00:56:05,767 --> 00:56:07,233
It's so good!

661
00:56:21,066 --> 00:56:23,633
Hey, was it gamsahabnida?

662
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:25,667
Right? Gamsahabnida.

663
00:56:30,133 --> 00:56:32,367
-Gamsahabnida.
-Gamsahabnida.

664
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,066
It was so delicious.

665
00:56:37,667 --> 00:56:40,066
-We'll come back again.
-All right, thanks.

666
00:56:54,633 --> 00:56:57,533
We're so busy from the start.

667
00:56:59,133 --> 00:57:01,066
What do we do? We should be bad

668
00:57:01,066 --> 00:57:03,100
to make this show entertaining.

669
00:57:03,133 --> 00:57:05,433
Us interns are too good.

670
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:09,400
-Tae Hyung.
-Yes?

671
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:12,066
-I think we should make some mistakes.
-Why?

672
00:57:12,133 --> 00:57:15,266
-We're too good now.
-Then...

673
00:57:15,333 --> 00:57:16,567
Should I not do dishes?

674
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:17,600
The dishes...

675
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,333
No, do the dishes.

676
00:57:19,433 --> 00:57:20,667
THINKING

677
00:57:20,734 --> 00:57:24,133
Maybe we should serve wrong menus
every once in a while.

678
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:25,667
We're too good.

679
00:57:31,533 --> 00:57:32,400
Hola.

680
00:57:35,500 --> 00:57:37,233
Sit here, sweetie.

681
00:57:40,233 --> 00:57:42,000
Come to the counter to order.

682
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:43,500
Two corn dogs.

683
00:57:44,100 --> 00:57:45,367
One? Two?

684
00:57:45,367 --> 00:57:46,467
Two corn dogs.

685
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:48,734
-Uno.
-One?

686
00:57:49,066 --> 00:57:51,200
This? One?

687
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:00,533
Four corn dogs?

688
00:58:01,367 --> 00:58:05,200
Two corn dogs, half-and-half
tater dog, and a tater dog.

689
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:06,767
All different kinds.

690
00:58:12,233 --> 00:58:15,266
Two corn dogs, half-and-half
tater dog, and a tater dog.

691
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,200
Okay.

692
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:19,767
We got four corn dogs only.

693
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,467
The key is to be quick.

694
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:25,000
Otherwise, it falls apart.

695
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:41,333
-Hola.
-Hola.

696
00:58:42,233 --> 00:58:43,433
How many?

697
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:44,700
Three.

698
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:48,500
No.

699
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:58,266
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

700
00:58:58,333 --> 00:59:00,233
You can order over there.

701
00:59:02,133 --> 00:59:05,133
Let's order different kinds
and share them.

702
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,533
Then how about we order
gimbap, tteokbokki, and chicken?

703
00:59:09,567 --> 00:59:12,734
Sabor mucho bien.

704
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,033
-So this is the Combo.
-This is good.

705
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:16,033
Okay, perfect.

706
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:18,433
I'd like to get one fried chicken.

707
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:20,133
And one cheese tteokbokki.

708
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,100
Let's order spicy pork gimbap too.

709
00:59:22,133 --> 00:59:23,467
And a corn dog?

710
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,066
Good choice.

711
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,600
-Two wines, one water...
-One Coke?

712
00:59:29,467 --> 00:59:32,033
-Are you from Korea?
-Yes, we are.

713
00:59:32,133 --> 00:59:34,433
Gracias is gomawo in Korean, right?

714
00:59:34,533 --> 00:59:36,533
-Gomawoyo.
-Gomawoyo.

715
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,266
Let's get rid of these intern badges soon.

716
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:54,633
At this rate,

717
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:57,633
I think we can open
our own restaurant soon.

718
00:59:57,700 --> 01:00:00,300
Yeah. We can totally
run a restaurant on our own.

719
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:01,600
We can do a food truck.

720
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:02,633
Yeah, a food truck.

721
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:04,266
That sounds better.

722
01:00:05,567 --> 01:00:08,166
-And have Seo Jin do dishes.
-Yeah, as our intern.

723
01:00:09,734 --> 01:00:11,133
We got another order.

724
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,133
Okay.

725
01:00:13,667 --> 01:00:15,500
Seo Jun. One cheese tteokbokki

726
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:18,066
and one half-and-half tater dog.

727
01:00:18,133 --> 01:00:18,667
For you.

728
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:21,400
-A new order?
-Yes, cheese tteokbokki.

729
01:00:31,633 --> 01:00:33,600
It's hot.

730
01:00:43,033 --> 01:00:44,133
Tae Hyung.

731
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:46,200
The one with no marks is half-and-half.

732
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:47,100
Okay.

733
01:00:47,133 --> 01:00:48,667
-No mark is half-and-half.
-Yeah.

734
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:55,533
This one is half-and-half.

735
01:00:59,633 --> 01:01:02,633
The red mark is the original
and this one's half-and-half.

736
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:04,467
Tae Hyung, could you come out?

737
01:01:14,467 --> 01:01:16,500
This one's the half-and-half tater dog.

738
01:01:19,166 --> 01:01:20,700
-Hola.
-Hola.

739
01:01:22,533 --> 01:01:24,266
One corn dog.

740
01:01:30,467 --> 01:01:31,667
It's so good.

741
01:01:34,266 --> 01:01:35,533
Do you wanna try this?

742
01:01:36,633 --> 01:01:37,500
Okay.

743
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:46,400
-It's very good.
-Do you wanna try?

744
01:01:51,266 --> 01:01:54,533
It's like eating a churro
with a sausage inside.

745
01:02:03,266 --> 01:02:05,567
-What are you doing?
-It's the water...

746
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,066
The wine looks so good.

747
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,600
I can already tell it's good.

748
01:02:15,033 --> 01:02:17,200
Let's make a toast.

749
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:18,433
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

750
01:02:18,533 --> 01:02:20,433
-What about me?
-Clink the water.

751
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:35,767
Where's Woo Shik?

752
01:02:36,166 --> 01:02:37,567
He's frying chicken.

753
01:02:37,667 --> 01:02:40,700
Eight... Nine...

754
01:02:45,467 --> 01:02:47,066
Which one was half-and-half?

755
01:02:47,166 --> 01:02:48,734
It's a half-and-half tater dog.

756
01:02:52,467 --> 01:02:54,467
-Done?
-Yes.

757
01:02:54,567 --> 01:02:56,633
-It's one portion.
-Okay.

758
01:02:57,567 --> 01:03:01,000
I think we should bring some tteokbokki.

759
01:03:02,433 --> 01:03:04,000
Never mind. I'll do it.

760
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:07,266
Working on the tteokbokki?

761
01:03:22,333 --> 01:03:26,233
Yes, I'm working on it.
It'll be out together.

762
01:03:41,367 --> 01:03:42,767
Could you add the cheese?

763
01:03:42,767 --> 01:03:44,166
Sure.

764
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,033
I melted the cheese a bit.

765
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:51,700
We serve these two sauces together.

766
01:03:51,734 --> 01:03:52,734
All right.

767
01:03:53,734 --> 01:03:56,300
-Where's this for?
-This goes here.

768
01:03:56,367 --> 01:03:57,533
We're done.

769
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:00,166
All right.

770
01:04:02,433 --> 01:04:04,734
Spicy pork gimbap for the white Buddha.

771
01:04:07,166 --> 01:04:08,233
-Spicy pork?
-Uh-huh.

772
01:04:08,667 --> 01:04:10,000
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

773
01:04:11,133 --> 01:04:14,066
This is picante and this is...

774
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,700
-No picante?
-Okay.

775
01:04:17,633 --> 01:04:19,533
We should take photos of the food.

776
01:04:19,600 --> 01:04:22,000
Let's take photos
after we get all the food.

777
01:04:38,633 --> 01:04:41,300
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

778
01:04:43,100 --> 01:04:44,300
Let's make it look nice.

779
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,033
-Send me the photos.
-Okay.

780
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,600
We should take some home.

781
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:08,633
We need beer too.

782
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:19,567
Is it spicy?

783
01:05:19,633 --> 01:05:21,633
A little. It's not super spicy.

784
01:05:24,233 --> 01:05:26,000
It's good.

785
01:05:27,767 --> 01:05:29,166
I love it.

786
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,734
This is the best weekend
I've ever had in my life.

787
01:05:38,533 --> 01:05:39,667
You got nothing to do?

788
01:05:39,734 --> 01:05:41,700
I'm done with my work for now.

789
01:05:41,734 --> 01:05:42,667
-Okay.
-I'll help.

790
01:05:42,700 --> 01:05:44,033
Thank you.

791
01:05:44,133 --> 01:05:45,533
There will be more later.

792
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:48,300
Hey, why don't we...

793
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,000
eat ramyeon later?

794
01:05:50,133 --> 01:05:53,433
We should. We need some energy.

795
01:05:54,133 --> 01:05:55,400
When we have a break.

796
01:05:55,467 --> 01:05:56,767
When we have a break.

797
01:05:57,433 --> 01:05:59,233
But it's been only 50 minutes.

798
01:05:59,233 --> 01:06:00,200
What time is it?

799
01:06:00,233 --> 01:06:01,467
Isn't it four yet?

800
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,333
-It's 2:50 PM.
-Still?

801
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:07,033
When is it gonna be 4 PM?

802
01:06:41,367 --> 01:06:42,667
Hola.

803
01:06:51,033 --> 01:06:52,000
Here you go.

804
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:00,200
-Hello.
-Hello.

805
01:07:01,533 --> 01:07:03,633
You pick whichever you think sounds good.

806
01:07:03,667 --> 01:07:05,266
I'll trust you.

807
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:10,500
Spicy sauce with soy sauce marinated pork...

808
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,633
The pork is a little spicy.

809
01:07:13,734 --> 01:07:15,200
A little spicy?

810
01:07:15,266 --> 01:07:16,600
Yeah, just a little bit.

811
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,033
-Let's go for it.
-Yeah.

812
01:07:18,133 --> 01:07:19,500
-We like spicy.
-Okay.

813
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,033
-We wanna have one of these.
-One.

814
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,433
And...

815
01:07:24,300 --> 01:07:26,033
And one of these.

816
01:07:28,033 --> 01:07:30,066
-Tteokbokki?
-Yeah, let's get that.

817
01:07:30,133 --> 01:07:32,100
-Tteokbokki.
-Tteokbokki?

818
01:07:32,367 --> 01:07:33,533
You like spicy food.

819
01:07:33,567 --> 01:07:35,367
Yes, we do.

820
01:07:36,433 --> 01:07:39,367
Can I have a Coke as well?

821
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:40,767
-I'll get Sprite.
-A Sprite.

822
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,600
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

823
01:07:42,633 --> 01:07:43,767
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

824
01:07:52,567 --> 01:07:54,133
-Seo Jin...
-Spicy pork.

825
01:07:54,133 --> 01:07:55,266
We need more broth.

826
01:07:55,266 --> 01:07:56,433
Spicy pork.

827
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:58,567
We should pour it all.

828
01:07:58,567 --> 01:08:00,433
-No, not all of it.
-It's not much.

829
01:08:00,500 --> 01:08:02,533
No, we should add it little by little.

830
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,066
Add more?

831
01:08:22,700 --> 01:08:23,734
Chicken.

832
01:08:28,133 --> 01:08:29,700
One.

833
01:08:30,700 --> 01:08:32,200
Two.

834
01:08:36,734 --> 01:08:39,066
-This is bad.
-What is?

835
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:40,400
Things are going too well.

836
01:08:40,433 --> 01:08:42,500
-Oh, everything's going too well?
-Yes.

837
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,633
-Here you go. One Coke and one Sprite.
-Thank you.

838
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:51,066
It's so cute, right?

839
01:08:53,200 --> 01:08:55,500
Have you had tteokbokki?

840
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,033
Yes.

841
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:58,166
I love it.

842
01:08:58,233 --> 01:09:00,166
On a scale of spiciness...

843
01:09:00,266 --> 01:09:01,600
Is it a different spicy?

844
01:09:01,633 --> 01:09:05,300
It's a different type,
but it's not too spicy.

845
01:09:13,066 --> 01:09:14,100
Are you sharing?

846
01:09:14,166 --> 01:09:15,734
Yes. It looks amazing.

847
01:09:18,100 --> 01:09:19,133
I'll show you.

848
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:20,633
Oh, please. Thank you.

849
01:09:21,734 --> 01:09:24,066
If you cut it into little pieces,

850
01:09:25,033 --> 01:09:26,633
it's easier to eat.

851
01:09:26,734 --> 01:09:28,066
-Amazing.
-Amazing.

852
01:09:28,133 --> 01:09:29,367
It looks delicious.

853
01:09:30,700 --> 01:09:33,066
-All right.
-Thank you.

854
01:09:38,467 --> 01:09:40,433
That guy made it look so easy,

855
01:09:40,433 --> 01:09:42,433
but you seem to be struggling.

856
01:09:43,066 --> 01:09:45,400
It's just not easy to hold it.

857
01:09:46,133 --> 01:09:48,000
-Do you wanna try?
-No.

858
01:10:01,066 --> 01:10:02,333
What is that?

859
01:10:02,433 --> 01:10:04,567
It's rice cake. It's tteokbokki.

860
01:10:05,734 --> 01:10:07,233
That was delicious.

861
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,100
And it's not spicy at all.

862
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,066
It's flavorsome.

863
01:10:14,767 --> 01:10:16,133
That's really yummy.

864
01:10:17,133 --> 01:10:18,333
Tae Hyung, good luck.

865
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:20,100
Thanks. Just leave it to me.

866
01:10:23,233 --> 01:10:25,200
-Tae Hyung.
-Yes?

867
01:10:25,667 --> 01:10:27,033
Good luck.

868
01:10:28,667 --> 01:10:30,767
Tae Hyung, good luck.

869
01:10:58,767 --> 01:11:00,567
They look amazing.

870
01:11:00,667 --> 01:11:02,600
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

871
01:11:04,567 --> 01:11:05,734
What's this?

872
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,200
Radish.

873
01:11:08,367 --> 01:11:09,700
I'm going to try and see.

874
01:11:17,033 --> 01:11:18,000
That's amazing.

875
01:11:18,066 --> 01:11:19,600
Is it the best chicken?

876
01:11:19,667 --> 01:11:22,266
This is the chicken I was dreaming about.

877
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:24,700
And your dreams came true.

878
01:11:25,467 --> 01:11:27,433
That was divine.

879
01:11:35,433 --> 01:11:37,133
Right?

880
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,467
-That's so good.
-It's sweet and spicy.

881
01:11:41,533 --> 01:11:43,166
Have you tried one of these?

882
01:11:43,233 --> 01:11:45,100
No, do you just eat it as is?

883
01:11:45,166 --> 01:11:46,667
I guess so.

884
01:11:46,734 --> 01:11:48,633
-Is it spicy?
-No.

885
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:50,500
What is it like?

886
01:11:51,300 --> 01:11:53,266
It's sweet and salty.

887
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,033
It's like pickles.

888
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,533
That was actually enjoyable.

889
01:12:24,767 --> 01:12:26,367
Hola.

890
01:12:29,066 --> 01:12:30,233
Hola.

891
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:32,667
-Menu?
-Hello.

892
01:12:34,033 --> 01:12:35,100
Two vegan...

893
01:12:35,166 --> 01:12:36,233
Two vegan gimbaps?

894
01:12:36,266 --> 01:12:40,400
-Two vegans and one with tuna.
-Tuna.

895
01:12:40,467 --> 01:12:41,500
Okay.

896
01:12:53,133 --> 01:12:55,367
Spicy pork for the black Buddha.

897
01:12:58,033 --> 01:12:59,400
Yu Mi, these are all yours.

898
01:12:59,433 --> 01:13:00,700
What?

899
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:05,133
Let's take it slow.

900
01:13:05,133 --> 01:13:07,133
No more making two at once.

901
01:13:07,133 --> 01:13:07,767
One at a time.

902
01:13:10,633 --> 01:13:12,033
This is gimbap.

903
01:13:12,100 --> 01:13:13,500
Amazing. Thank you so much.

904
01:13:13,567 --> 01:13:16,367
-It's all so delicious.
-Is it? That's great.

905
01:13:17,066 --> 01:13:19,066
This is spicier than this one.

906
01:13:19,166 --> 01:13:21,200
-Okay. Thank you.
-Thank you.

907
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,500
These look amazing.

908
01:13:23,567 --> 01:13:24,533
Oh, my God.

909
01:13:26,667 --> 01:13:28,166
That's fine.

910
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,300
Yea, go for it.

911
01:13:35,633 --> 01:13:37,433
-Did you eat it in one bite?
-Yes.

912
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:43,767
I don't think it's spicy.

913
01:13:44,033 --> 01:13:45,500
-It's not spicy,
-No.

914
01:13:58,133 --> 01:13:59,300
Wait, what?

915
01:13:59,367 --> 01:14:03,433
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight, nine...

916
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:15,400
Vegan gimbap?

917
01:14:15,467 --> 01:14:17,567
That's hers and his.

918
01:14:20,467 --> 01:14:22,300
I need to tell them something.

919
01:14:22,367 --> 01:14:23,667
You need a spicy sauce.

920
01:14:24,266 --> 01:14:27,033
-Do you have a spicy sauce?
-Spicy?

921
01:14:29,467 --> 01:14:30,667
Which one is spicy?

922
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:33,467
-This is spicy.
-Oh, okay then.

923
01:14:36,233 --> 01:14:38,433
Ponga la salsa.

924
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,567
Ponga la salsa?

925
01:14:39,633 --> 01:14:41,266
-Pongala?
-Ponga la.

926
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:43,533
-Ponga la salsa.
-Pongala?

927
01:14:45,633 --> 01:14:47,100
Ponga la salsa?

928
01:14:47,133 --> 01:14:48,533
It means to dip it.

929
01:14:50,633 --> 01:14:54,033
Ponga la salsa.

930
01:15:16,700 --> 01:15:18,633
-It's so good.
-Yeah.

931
01:15:20,133 --> 01:15:22,066
It's so fresh.

932
01:15:32,734 --> 01:15:34,667
Look at the dog.

933
01:15:34,734 --> 01:15:35,734
Hola.

934
01:15:40,467 --> 01:15:41,600
It came again.

935
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:44,133
Hey, Jinny.

936
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:46,200
Seo Jin is here.

937
01:15:48,000 --> 01:15:49,500
I think it'll sleep there.

938
01:15:49,533 --> 01:15:51,033
I knew it.

939
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:56,500
It's like this is its home.

940
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,700
I also have a dog like that
that comes to my house.

941
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:06,200
It's the same dog.

942
01:16:06,266 --> 01:16:07,300
Is it?

943
01:16:21,567 --> 01:16:22,667
It's 4 PM.

944
01:16:22,734 --> 01:16:24,200
It's 4:10 PM.

945
01:16:24,300 --> 01:16:25,533
Oh, yea?

946
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,500
We're usually busy between 2 PM and 4 PM.

947
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:33,767
Then between 4 PM and 5 PM, no customers.

948
01:16:34,033 --> 01:16:36,533
So tomorrow, during this time...

949
01:16:36,667 --> 01:16:38,200
-A break?
-Yes, a break.

950
01:16:38,266 --> 01:16:39,567
And eat something.

951
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:41,600
Aww, for your employees?

952
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:43,066
I just think that's fair.

953
01:16:43,133 --> 01:16:44,734
Yes, let's do it.

954
01:16:46,567 --> 01:16:49,000
Shouldn't we be having a break now?

955
01:16:49,066 --> 01:16:52,333
Let's tell the customers that
they can stay in the dining area,

956
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:55,233
-but we're on a break. Yes.
-Now?

957
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:58,533
Employee welfare is important.

958
01:16:58,567 --> 01:17:01,000
It will motivate them to work hard,

959
01:17:01,066 --> 01:17:03,233
which will eventually improve food quality

960
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:05,166
and increase our sales.

961
01:17:05,367 --> 01:17:09,367
Providing a good environment to work
to serve good food

962
01:17:09,400 --> 01:17:11,000
and to make profits.

963
01:17:15,734 --> 01:17:17,667
Gimbap...

964
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:26,166
Hello.

965
01:17:29,133 --> 01:17:30,400
Excuse me, we're...

966
01:17:30,467 --> 01:17:32,533
-For later.
-Oh, okay.

967
01:17:32,567 --> 01:17:35,000
We're going to have a break, so...

968
01:17:35,066 --> 01:17:36,233
Okay, cool.

969
01:17:38,500 --> 01:17:40,000
It looks good.

970
01:17:43,266 --> 01:17:44,266
Let's take a photo.

971
01:17:48,567 --> 01:17:50,066
Take a photo of that.

972
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:51,300
Yeah, I will.

973
01:17:54,433 --> 01:17:56,033
Very cheap.

974
01:17:56,133 --> 01:17:58,033
Look. It's you.

975
01:17:58,066 --> 01:17:59,233
Look.

976
01:18:13,233 --> 01:18:15,200
Hello.

977
01:18:15,233 --> 01:18:17,200
We're closed now.

978
01:18:18,333 --> 01:18:20,066
But we'll open for dinner later.

979
01:18:20,266 --> 01:18:21,367
Oh, okay, later.

980
01:18:21,467 --> 01:18:23,500
-Okay. Thank you.
-Thank you.

981
01:18:39,567 --> 01:18:41,000
Sorry, we're closed.

982
01:18:41,433 --> 01:18:42,767
You're closed?

983
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:44,767
They can come back for dinner.

984
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,233
We'll open for dinner.

985
01:18:46,767 --> 01:18:48,300
-Okay?
-Thank you.

986
01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:58,333
Oh, did somebody order it?

987
01:18:58,433 --> 01:19:00,100
No, I just wanna practice.

988
01:19:03,266 --> 01:19:05,266
Are we selling the hellamyeon?

989
01:19:05,333 --> 01:19:07,767
The food here is very spicy.

990
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,166
Mucho, mucho, picante.

991
01:19:11,200 --> 01:19:12,400
Diablo.

992
01:19:12,467 --> 01:19:14,066
-Devil?
-Devil.

993
01:19:19,200 --> 01:19:20,734
Sugar and mayo.

994
01:19:42,233 --> 01:19:43,633
-Oh, the leftovers.
-Yup.

995
01:20:12,433 --> 01:20:14,233
It's so easy.

996
01:21:17,734 --> 01:21:21,133
-Did you add all of the sauce?
-Yes, for now.

997
01:21:24,400 --> 01:21:25,667
-Is it okay?
-It's yummy.

998
01:21:29,367 --> 01:21:31,233
It's spicy, but tasty.

999
01:21:37,233 --> 01:21:38,700
Tae Hyung, you'll try it?

1000
01:21:38,767 --> 01:21:40,166
He might cry.

1001
01:21:40,767 --> 01:21:42,300
It's really spicy.

1002
01:21:44,033 --> 01:21:46,700
-But it's a good spicy.
-Oh, yea?

1003
01:21:49,266 --> 01:21:50,567
That's a lot.

1004
01:21:55,333 --> 01:21:56,233
It's good spicy.

1005
01:21:56,266 --> 01:21:57,400
Good spicy?

1006
01:21:58,367 --> 01:22:00,000
It's spicy, but really good.

1007
01:22:03,633 --> 01:22:06,367
-That was divine.
-It was amazing.

1008
01:22:07,367 --> 01:22:08,600
Thank you.

1009
01:22:08,633 --> 01:22:10,033
Bye-bye.

1010
01:22:26,700 --> 01:22:29,266
-Gracias.
-Gracias.

1011
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:31,133
-Have a nice day.
-Thank you.

1012
01:22:47,333 --> 01:22:49,166
I think we should write it down.

1013
01:22:49,233 --> 01:22:51,667
-Our break time.
-How long is the break?

1014
01:22:51,734 --> 01:22:53,467
Let's decide that on our own.

1015
01:22:54,467 --> 01:22:56,300
We need it.

1016
01:22:58,700 --> 01:23:00,066
When does it end?

1017
01:23:00,133 --> 01:23:01,367
-What?
-Our break.

1018
01:23:02,266 --> 01:23:04,000
I was thinking 5:30 PM.

1019
01:23:04,066 --> 01:23:06,300
I was told to put up a notice, so...

1020
01:23:15,734 --> 01:23:17,600
Did you say 5:30 PM?

1021
01:23:17,667 --> 01:23:19,567
-Is it too short?
-Yes.

1022
01:23:20,633 --> 01:23:22,533
How about 6 PM?

1023
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:25,166
People will start coming after 5 PM.

1024
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:26,700
What do we do?

1025
01:23:26,767 --> 01:23:28,133
Could you go ask Yu Mi

1026
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:30,433
how long the prep will take?

1027
01:23:30,467 --> 01:23:32,367
How long does the prep take?

1028
01:23:32,433 --> 01:23:34,000
About 30 minutes.

1029
01:23:34,066 --> 01:23:37,133
About 30? Should we open at 6 PM then?

1030
01:23:37,166 --> 01:23:39,200
-Can it be done by 5:30 PM?
-Can it?

1031
01:23:39,233 --> 01:23:40,700
No.

1032
01:23:41,233 --> 01:23:43,367
Cucumbers, we need more.

1033
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:50,700
Let's eat something.
Some chicken if there's nothing else.

1034
01:23:51,033 --> 01:23:53,100
-So... 6 PM?
-Yes.

1035
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:04,600
-Do we have food?
-You stayed?

1036
01:24:05,500 --> 01:24:07,367
You remembered us.

1037
01:24:07,400 --> 01:24:08,600
Wait here.

1038
01:24:08,667 --> 01:24:10,300
Wait here for a second.

1039
01:24:10,367 --> 01:24:11,734
We haven't eaten yet either.

1040
01:24:12,000 --> 01:24:13,133
Please give us a minute.

1041
01:24:16,367 --> 01:24:18,033
This is for us.

1042
01:24:35,000 --> 01:24:36,166
That should be enough.

1043
01:24:59,633 --> 01:25:00,633
Let's eat.

1044
01:25:03,467 --> 01:25:06,166
-Come eat.
-Okay, let's eat.

1045
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:07,700
I love kimchi.

1046
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,700
Someone's out there.

1047
01:25:14,133 --> 01:25:15,066
Hola.

1048
01:25:15,133 --> 01:25:16,166
Someone's here.

1049
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:19,533
Hey! Hi!

1050
01:25:23,500 --> 01:25:27,300
You should come. We'll give you good food.

1051
01:25:27,400 --> 01:25:29,333
-Hola.
-Hola.

1052
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,133
-It's good.
-Yea?

1053
01:25:34,166 --> 01:25:35,333
Muy bien, muy bien.

1054
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,133
Mucho gracias.

1055
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:40,066
It's the cafe owner.

1056
01:25:40,266 --> 01:25:41,400
Hola.

1057
01:25:43,066 --> 01:25:45,200
-Muchas gracias.
-Gracias.

1058
01:25:45,233 --> 01:25:48,266
-Bueno.
-Bueno.

1059
01:25:49,033 --> 01:25:50,533
Muy bien, muy bien.

1060
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,633
Thank you.

1061
01:25:53,667 --> 01:25:55,467
Are you guys trying to eat?

1062
01:25:55,500 --> 01:25:56,500
We can wait

1063
01:25:56,567 --> 01:25:59,767
-if you're busy or something...
-Okay.

1064
01:26:00,633 --> 01:26:02,166
Well, we start at 6 PM.

1065
01:26:02,233 --> 01:26:05,266
No problem. We can come back later.

1066
01:26:05,333 --> 01:26:06,667
Okay.

1067
01:26:07,467 --> 01:26:10,066
-Then see you at 6 PM.
-Okay.

1068
01:26:10,166 --> 01:26:12,033
-Thank you very much.
-You're welcome.

1069
01:26:14,000 --> 01:26:15,166
Do you have umbrellas?

1070
01:26:15,433 --> 01:26:17,500
-We have a car right here.
-Okay.

1071
01:26:17,567 --> 01:26:19,667
-See you at 6 PM.
-See you soon.

1072
01:26:19,734 --> 01:26:21,200
Thank you.

1073
01:26:25,033 --> 01:26:26,500
-Gee...
-This looks great.

1074
01:26:54,233 --> 01:26:56,700
It's 40 pesos.

1075
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:30,667
Thanks for the food.

1076
01:27:31,767 --> 01:27:33,734
-Perro.
-Perro?

1077
01:27:35,633 --> 01:27:37,066
Seo Jin.

1078
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:49,667
Are you okay?

1079
01:27:49,734 --> 01:27:52,100
-Huh?
-Are you okay?

1080
01:27:52,166 --> 01:27:53,300
Of course.

1081
01:27:54,767 --> 01:27:59,600
What's your sales goal here in Bacalar?

1082
01:28:00,300 --> 01:28:02,667
Well, 10,000 pesos
would be too ambitious, right?

1083
01:28:02,734 --> 01:28:05,133
Ten thousand...

1084
01:28:05,166 --> 01:28:07,567
If I share that,
my employees might rise up.

1085
01:28:11,066 --> 01:28:14,767
Your original plan was
to have a break until 5:30 PM.

1086
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,100
That was my original plan...

1087
01:28:19,133 --> 01:28:22,367
But they said
they ran out of prepared ingredients.

1088
01:28:22,467 --> 01:28:24,200
Now I have to call them back.

1089
01:28:24,233 --> 01:28:25,767
Otherwise, they'll never do it.

1090
01:28:28,767 --> 01:28:31,433
I could really use a power nap now.

1091
01:28:36,166 --> 01:28:38,066
5:30 PM

1092
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,233
Shouldn't you prep the pork?

1093
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:44,266
Huh?

1094
01:28:44,767 --> 01:28:46,667
The pork.

1095
01:28:46,734 --> 01:28:48,100
Woo Shik?

1096
01:28:48,133 --> 01:28:49,367
-Tae Hyung?
-Yes.

1097
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:50,500
Let's go do the pork.

1098
01:28:51,633 --> 01:28:53,200
Let's go prep the pork.

1099
01:28:53,734 --> 01:28:55,066
Let's go.

1100
01:29:00,734 --> 01:29:02,166
Perro?

1101
01:29:04,734 --> 01:29:07,000
Let's go.

1102
01:29:07,400 --> 01:29:10,000
Okay. Let's get it!

1103
01:29:20,767 --> 01:29:22,400
Woo Shik, what are you doing?

1104
01:29:22,433 --> 01:29:23,533
Spicy pork.

1105
01:29:47,166 --> 01:29:49,100
Yu Mi, could you come over and...

1106
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:53,500
Go on.

1107
01:29:54,567 --> 01:29:55,500
Closer.

1108
01:29:55,567 --> 01:29:56,600
Okay.

1109
01:29:57,333 --> 01:29:58,400
What's wrong with you?

1110
01:29:58,467 --> 01:29:59,734
I got a little scared.

1111
01:30:14,533 --> 01:30:18,000
Could you cut the cucumbers?
I'll do the dishes.

1112
01:30:19,133 --> 01:30:20,700
-You want me to wipe them?
-Yes.

1113
01:30:39,300 --> 01:30:41,266
Yu Mi, I'll set the veggies.

1114
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:42,767
Okay. Make sure they're drained.

1115
01:30:43,033 --> 01:30:44,700
They're completely drained.

1116
01:30:52,533 --> 01:30:54,233
Thank you. I'll do it now.

1117
01:31:09,467 --> 01:31:10,333
Let's open.

1118
01:31:10,433 --> 01:31:11,433
What?

1119
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:15,133
-We're opening.
-Okay.

1120
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,100
Hello.

1121
01:31:29,000 --> 01:31:30,600
-Is it open?
-We're open, yes.

1122
01:31:40,367 --> 01:31:43,200
-Hola.
-Hi.

1123
01:31:43,300 --> 01:31:44,367
Hi, sweetie.

1124
01:31:44,467 --> 01:31:46,300
Say hi. Say hola.

1125
01:31:46,400 --> 01:31:48,033
Hola.

1126
01:31:49,400 --> 01:31:51,033
Say, "How are you?"

1127
01:31:52,667 --> 01:31:54,000
Any table is okay?

1128
01:31:54,066 --> 01:31:56,000
-Yeah, any table.
-Okay.

1129
01:31:56,033 --> 01:31:57,266
Sit with Mommy.

1130
01:32:01,567 --> 01:32:04,567
They have some sausage menu.
It's the original one.

1131
01:32:04,633 --> 01:32:06,567
Come here. Hold my hand.

1132
01:32:06,633 --> 01:32:08,600
Okay, sweetie. Come here.

1133
01:32:23,033 --> 01:32:24,767
Hello. Hola.

1134
01:32:30,133 --> 01:32:31,000
Hola.

1135
01:32:36,333 --> 01:32:39,100
-We got customers.
-Okay.

1136
01:32:39,166 --> 01:32:40,700
-I'll take it from here.
-Okay.

1137
01:32:45,333 --> 01:32:47,300
-Hola. Hey.
-How are you guys?

1138
01:32:47,367 --> 01:32:48,600
-Good, how are you?
-Good.

1139
01:32:51,033 --> 01:32:52,433
-Two and one of this.
-Two?

1140
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:56,033
-One tuna, and one...
-One corn dog...

1141
01:32:56,100 --> 01:32:58,367
-And one of this.
-One bulgogi gimbap.

1142
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:01,000
So...

1143
01:33:04,300 --> 01:33:06,233
-This one?
-Yes.

1144
01:33:10,767 --> 01:33:14,166
I'd like to get a Hellamyeon.

1145
01:33:17,266 --> 01:33:18,700
-It's spicy.
-It's okay.

1146
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,300
Number two with the chicken?

1147
01:33:23,367 --> 01:33:24,467
-Yes.
-Okay.

1148
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:28,233
It's on me. It's okay.

1149
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:30,033
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

1150
01:33:45,133 --> 01:33:46,767
Oh, my gosh.

1151
01:33:49,567 --> 01:33:50,567
We got an order.

1152
01:33:52,633 --> 01:33:53,500
An order.

1153
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,233
Hellamyeon.

1154
01:33:58,066 --> 01:33:59,133
We got chicken again.

1155
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:00,500
Do we have enough chicken?

1156
01:34:05,100 --> 01:34:07,066
-Yu Mi.
-Yes.

1157
01:34:07,200 --> 01:34:08,000
A gimbap.

1158
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:11,667
Again?

1159
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,667
-One more.
-I just made three.

1160
01:34:16,767 --> 01:34:17,767
We got time, right?

1161
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,100
-Sorry.
-No tables.

1162
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:26,767
Why is Woo Shik crying?

1163
01:34:27,066 --> 01:34:27,633
Welfare.

1164
01:34:27,667 --> 01:34:30,200
Employee welfare is important.

1165
01:34:30,233 --> 01:34:32,300
It will improve the food quality.

1166
01:34:32,367 --> 01:34:34,200
And increase our sales.

1167
01:34:35,467 --> 01:34:37,166
So nice, right?

1168
01:34:39,066 --> 01:34:40,133
Muy bien.

1169
01:34:48,133 --> 01:34:49,734
A-yo!

1170
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,767
We should hand out flyers.

1171
01:34:57,734 --> 01:34:59,567
Parasite promotion.

1172
01:35:00,333 --> 01:35:01,734
This is amazing.

1173
01:35:02,467 --> 01:35:04,066
I don't want to close my eyes.

1174
01:35:07,133 --> 01:35:09,033
-Hola.
-Hola.

1175
01:35:13,233 --> 01:35:14,433
Why is no one coming?

1176
01:35:14,667 --> 01:35:15,700
Gosh.

1177
01:35:18,400 --> 01:35:20,367
Why are there so many fritters?

1178
01:35:23,533 --> 01:35:25,500
I am not afraid.

1179
01:35:25,600 --> 01:35:27,467
Shall we close early today?

1180
01:35:27,667 --> 01:35:29,367
What are you talking about?

1181
01:35:31,066 --> 01:35:32,467
He's asking for discipline.

1182
01:35:32,533 --> 01:35:34,233
What am I gonna do with him?

1183
01:35:34,333 --> 01:35:36,400
Why is there nobody?

1184
01:35:36,467 --> 01:35:38,033
We should do this too.

1185
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:46,266
Nice, good.

1186
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:31,000
