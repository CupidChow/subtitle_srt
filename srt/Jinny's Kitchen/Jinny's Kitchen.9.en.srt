00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:25,967
JINNY'S KITCHEN

2
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:27,900
We have three reservations already.

3
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,266
Let's add one more table.

4
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:31,900
The boss has changed.

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
- I'll open.
- Okay.

6
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:35,934
- We have a reservation.
- Oh, really?

7
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:38,367
Hola.

8
00:00:38,433 --> 00:00:40,066
- It'll take 10 minutes.
- Okay.

9
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,000
We're having a rush again.

10
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:44,467
I'd like to order the tater dog to-go.

11
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:46,734
- Two, please.
- Take-out.

12
00:00:47,166 --> 00:00:48,367
Why are there so many?

13
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:50,467
Tomorrow, we must set a record.

14
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:52,533
No break tomorrow. It's our last day.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,400
So this is really all about money to him.

16
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:57,533
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

17
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:40,066
I bet I suggested leaving at 11:30 AM.

18
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:43,066
'Cause we have a lot to do.

19
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:44,667
I don't remember hearing that.

20
00:01:44,767 --> 00:01:46,200
It's 11:30 AM. I'm sure.

21
00:01:51,166 --> 00:01:54,033
Seo Jin, we're all leaving
at 11:30 AM, right?

22
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,867
- Yes.
- Right?

23
00:01:55,934 --> 00:01:57,133
You washed up already.

24
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,300
Because it's time.

25
00:01:58,367 --> 00:02:00,500
- Huh?
- It's our last day.

26
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:02,500
Well, this is new.

27
00:02:02,567 --> 00:02:05,333
I told them to take time for you.

28
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,667
Wake up.

29
00:02:06,767 --> 00:02:08,333
Go wash up.

30
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:10,467
I can wash up real fast.

31
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:19,000
You are…

32
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:22,066
Have you always liked cereal?

33
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:23,100
Yes… no.

34
00:02:24,567 --> 00:02:26,300
I don't like cereal that much.

35
00:03:03,567 --> 00:03:05,133
Finally, today is the last day.

36
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,166
What's your goal for today?
Your final goal.

37
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:09,734
Could you tell us what it is?

38
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,767
Well, since it's our last day,

39
00:03:11,834 --> 00:03:14,433
I just want a smooth and safe day at work.

40
00:03:14,533 --> 00:03:15,600
A safe day.

41
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,266
That's all.

42
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:18,934
An injury-free

43
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:21,500
and accident-free day.

44
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,100
If we hit 12,000, I'll close.

45
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,500
I knew it. I knew he'd say 12,000.

46
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:29,266
I don't want to see the staff

47
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,567
being too tired.

48
00:03:32,633 --> 00:03:34,500
I'm not tired at all.

49
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:35,700
You're not?

50
00:03:35,767 --> 00:03:38,000
If we get more customers,
let's consider closing later.

51
00:03:38,066 --> 00:03:39,066
What?

52
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,934
I don't want to look all money-hungry.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,533
Says the man who's been money-hungry.

54
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:50,000
No, I was never like that.

55
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,567
I was never money-hungry.

56
00:03:51,667 --> 00:03:53,033
You were never money-hungry?

57
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,834
I was more like…

58
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:56,567
Could you move back a little?

59
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,600
I wasn't money-hungry.

60
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:01,800
I just wanted to introduce Korean food
to many people.

61
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:04,133
- That's all?
- Yes.

62
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,500
Money doesn't matter.

63
00:04:06,433 --> 00:04:08,200
Do you think this policy

64
00:04:08,266 --> 00:04:10,500
could be criticized?

65
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,133
Let them criticize me.

66
00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:25,800
Man, business is hard.

67
00:04:39,633 --> 00:04:40,734
Hello!

68
00:04:45,934 --> 00:04:47,633
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

69
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:50,033
Thank you.

70
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:52,834
Grate cucumbers now.

71
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:57,300
Why would you go to a clothing store?

72
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,633
- What?
- Why would you go to a clothing store?

73
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:01,900
I'm not frying chicken today then.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,200
Today, you're only frying chicken.

75
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,533
There's no line outside, right?
Let's close.

76
00:05:05,633 --> 00:05:07,633
It's a new menu. Chibap.

77
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,967
Today's new menu.

78
00:05:10,467 --> 00:05:11,834
When there's only one car,

79
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,967
who should ride it?
The employees or the boss?

80
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,200
Are you kidding now?

81
00:05:17,266 --> 00:05:19,667
It will motivate them to work hard,

82
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:21,567
which will eventually

83
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:23,667
improve the food quality

84
00:05:23,734 --> 00:05:25,567
and increase our sales.

85
00:05:25,633 --> 00:05:27,367
- There's no customer, so sit down.
- Okay.

86
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:28,500
Here's the apron.

87
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:29,967
I'll go buy burritos.

88
00:05:30,066 --> 00:05:31,333
- Okay.
- Okay.

89
00:05:31,433 --> 00:05:33,567
I can make some steak.

90
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:34,734
Beef steak?

91
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,133
So tomorrow, during this time,

92
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:39,633
let's have a break and eat something.

93
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,800
Aww, for your employees?

94
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:42,767
- I just think that's fair.
- How about…

95
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:45,066
It's over 10,000.

96
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:47,400
- We did?
- We made over 10,000 pesos.

97
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:49,734
We barely made it.

98
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,967
This is why I let them in.

99
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:52,600
You're smiling from ear to ear.

100
00:05:52,667 --> 00:05:54,533
Gosh, I'm so tired.

101
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,567
I don't care about 10,000 pesos.
I'm so dead tired.

102
00:06:05,033 --> 00:06:06,533
To hit 13,000 pesos,

103
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:09,000
we must focus on the rice menu.

104
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,667
- Yu Mi.
- Yes?

105
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,100
Do you have more cute socks?

106
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,166
- Why?
- Even now,

107
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:14,633
he cares so much about fashion.

108
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,300
Come on.

109
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:17,400
You barely leave the kitchen.

110
00:06:17,467 --> 00:06:18,700
Who cares about your socks?

111
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:20,600
Just wear anything.

112
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:22,133
I'm an idol.

113
00:06:22,834 --> 00:06:26,333
What's your goal for the last day,
Chef Park?

114
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,000
- Chef Park.
- My goal?

115
00:06:28,967 --> 00:06:30,667
My goal today is

116
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:32,667
that all of us can stay safe

117
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,467
and out of trouble

118
00:06:34,567 --> 00:06:37,066
so we can go back to Korea in one piece.

119
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:41,000
Chef Park is so nice.
He says safety is the most important.

120
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,367
I said that first.

121
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:45,266
What are you trying to say?

122
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:47,000
I said that earlier.

123
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:48,667
I wish we could all, you know,

124
00:06:48,734 --> 00:06:49,967
have a smooth,

125
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:51,934
safe day at work today.

126
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,433
What's our lunch menu today?

127
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,100
There's no lunch menu.

128
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,934
We're having gimbap for lunch.

129
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:00,467
We should get going.

130
00:07:00,533 --> 00:07:01,633
We're running late.

131
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,233
Let's go.

132
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,834
Let's start our last day!

133
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,166
- Last day!
- Let's go.

134
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:08,934
Put the camera in the middle.

135
00:07:09,033 --> 00:07:11,667
Put the camera on the ground.

136
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:13,667
Let's do this.

137
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:20,467
Come on, let's huddle up!

138
00:07:20,533 --> 00:07:22,233
Let's chant "12,000."

139
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,800
Say, "12,000, 12,000, 12,000." Okay?

140
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:26,233
Say that three times.

141
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,400
All right.

142
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:29,433
We got this.

143
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,500
Three, two, one.

144
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,033
Let's go for 12,000, 12,000, 12,000!

145
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,033
Let's go!

146
00:07:35,967 --> 00:07:37,800
- Let's go.
- Vámonos.

147
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:39,100
Vámonos.

148
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:40,700
The weather is really nice.

149
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,467
I think this is the best weather
we've ever had here.

150
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:45,567
Even the weather is perfect.

151
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:47,934
The weather is amazing.

152
00:07:52,467 --> 00:07:54,033
Let's hurry, Tae Hyung.

153
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,433
Why are you driving slow?

154
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,066
- I just…
- You don't wanna work?

155
00:07:57,133 --> 00:07:58,066
You have to, eventually.

156
00:07:58,133 --> 00:07:59,734
I just want to enjoy the view.

157
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,367
I think

158
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:03,200
I haven't seen much.

159
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,400
Today,

160
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,567
I rented a whole restaurant.

161
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:23,934
- Who?
- In the evening.

162
00:08:26,867 --> 00:08:28,667
My boss is amazing.

163
00:08:28,734 --> 00:08:30,300
You rented the whole place?

164
00:08:30,367 --> 00:08:31,800
Yes, the whole restaurant.

165
00:08:31,867 --> 00:08:34,100
Are we spending all of our income there?

166
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,633
No, I'm paying.

167
00:08:40,266 --> 00:08:43,100
So I can order whatever drink I want?

168
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,166
Not you.

169
00:08:49,934 --> 00:08:52,166
I see many people.

170
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,734
There are lots of people today.

171
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:57,100
We have customers?

172
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:00,467
Already?

173
00:09:02,767 --> 00:09:03,767
Hola.

174
00:09:08,867 --> 00:09:10,567
The dog is lying there.

175
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,200
He's lying there.

176
00:09:12,266 --> 00:09:13,266
- Huh?
- He's lying there.

177
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:14,567
- Where? Oh.
- Over there.

178
00:09:14,633 --> 00:09:15,734
Perro.

179
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,834
- Perro.
- Perro.

180
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:18,934
Perro.

181
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:27,166
We're here.

182
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:32,500
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

183
00:09:41,033 --> 00:09:42,133
Whoa.

184
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,033
That's a lot of chicken meat.

185
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,867
Woo Shik, here.

186
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:11,834
Thanks.

187
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:17,266
Thanks.

188
00:10:18,867 --> 00:10:20,166
We gotta speed up today.

189
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:22,200
- Okay, we'll speed up.
- Speed.

190
00:10:22,266 --> 00:10:24,233
Let's speed up.

191
00:10:44,867 --> 00:10:46,300
We're prepping a lot.

192
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,467
Man, this is a lot.

193
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:13,500
Whoa.

194
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:20,166
To fry this all,

195
00:11:20,233 --> 00:11:22,066
I probably won't get to do serving.

196
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:24,633
Shouldn't you speed up then?

197
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:28,433
Bye, everyone.

198
00:11:29,667 --> 00:11:31,467
I'm going to chicken hell now.

199
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,166
They got all stuck.

200
00:11:45,467 --> 00:11:46,567
No, more.

201
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:47,667
- More?
- Yes.

202
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:03,000
Smile.

203
00:12:03,066 --> 00:12:04,767
Okay, I'll smile.

204
00:12:04,834 --> 00:12:06,700
Smile.

205
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,333
We should set a new sales record today.

206
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:14,200
Right. It's our last day,

207
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:15,800
so let's grate them all.

208
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:27,133
Be careful with your hand.

209
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,367
When will you be done?

210
00:12:30,433 --> 00:12:32,333
This never seems to get full.

211
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,800
Grate the cucumbers now.

212
00:12:40,834 --> 00:12:41,734
Wow.

213
00:12:41,834 --> 00:12:43,400
Oh, nice.

214
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:45,500
Good job.

215
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,300
You did a great job.

216
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:51,033
You've improved a lot.

217
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,300
It's like you've been doing
the grating job for long.

218
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,367
The more I do it, the better I get.

219
00:12:58,433 --> 00:13:00,667
- Right?
- It's so interesting.

220
00:13:09,467 --> 00:13:11,166
That's a lot of grated carrots.

221
00:13:11,233 --> 00:13:12,600
Amazing.

222
00:13:14,033 --> 00:13:16,467
I thought I'd be horrible at cooking.

223
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:19,233
You've discovered your hidden talent here.

224
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:24,266
Are you done?

225
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,700
Smile.

226
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,133
Okay.

227
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:30,066
Smile.

228
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,834
You can take it now.

229
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,066
- Thank you.
- You can take it.

230
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,800
We need a sample rice bowl.

231
00:15:10,333 --> 00:15:11,266
Could you put this in?

232
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,800
Oh, it looks nice.

233
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:15,467
She did a great job.

234
00:15:15,533 --> 00:15:16,834
It looks beautiful.

235
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,934
Yu Mi, nice.

236
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,333
The sample looks great.

237
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,033
I'll put it below.

238
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,734
Let's take a break.

239
00:15:52,734 --> 00:15:54,166
Do you need more time?

240
00:15:54,233 --> 00:15:55,200
Can I take orders?

241
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:57,400
- Seo Jun, are you done prepping?
- Yes.

242
00:15:57,467 --> 00:15:59,266
We're prepping now still.

243
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,967
- Can we open now?
- Well…

244
00:16:01,066 --> 00:16:02,533
The chicken isn't ready yet.

245
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,066
I'm hungry.

246
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:15,633
Should we eat something now?

247
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,200
How about some bulgogi rice?

248
00:16:17,266 --> 00:16:18,166
Sounds good.

249
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,300
I put some aside.

250
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,233
Woo Shik.

251
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:47,233
- Fried tofu gimbap?
- Yes.

252
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,533
Just wait.

253
00:17:17,033 --> 00:17:19,533
Come here.

254
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Come up here.

255
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,734
Hi, Perro. Come here.

256
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,800
Come here.

257
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,934
Hi.

258
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:32,734
Come. It's for you.

259
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,633
It's a treat for you.

260
00:17:35,066 --> 00:17:36,767
Come here.

261
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,400
- A treat.
- He's so cute.

262
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,400
Come here.

263
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:45,500
Hey, buddy.

264
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,133
Here.

265
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,433
Oh, my goodness.

266
00:17:57,934 --> 00:17:59,800
Come in.

267
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,700
So cool, right?

268
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:13,567
Awww, look at you!

269
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,834
He loves it.

270
00:18:16,934 --> 00:18:19,300
Oh, you.

271
00:18:19,934 --> 00:18:20,834
My gosh.

272
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:22,133
Look at him.

273
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,033
- He loves it.
- He loves it.

274
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:32,533
Is it done?

275
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,900
We just need the spoons and chopsticks.

276
00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:45,900
Let's dig in.

277
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,567
Let's see how it tastes.

278
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:52,133
Mmm!

279
00:18:52,233 --> 00:18:53,467
The bulgogi is good.

280
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:05,633
Tae Hyung, mix the sauce with the rice.

281
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,400
Seriously, try it.

282
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,867
With a spoon.

283
00:19:11,533 --> 00:19:12,567
Will you eat it all?

284
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:15,433
All of it? Before you know?

285
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,633
I had to put it in.

286
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:30,200
Whoa.

287
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,867
It literally

288
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,433
makes me tear up.

289
00:19:45,133 --> 00:19:46,433
- Done?
- Yes.

290
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:49,834
I'll open now.

291
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,166
- Okay.
- Okay.

292
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,033
I wonder what's going to happen today.

293
00:20:14,734 --> 00:20:17,133
That's obviously a TV show line.

294
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:25,233
Seriously.

295
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,233
- You do the opening.
- The flip?

296
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,233
Should I just flip it like this?

297
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,000
Yes, flip it.

298
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:35,066
Open!

299
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:38,367
I'll open.

300
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:07,133
You look energized whenever you're here.

301
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,900
- In this restaurant?
- Yes.

302
00:21:08,967 --> 00:21:10,033
Only before noon.

303
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:14,333
We come here in the afternoon.
What are you talking about?

304
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,166
Out for dinner today!

305
00:21:18,233 --> 00:21:19,767
After we sell all the food.

306
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,867
What if we don't have customers today?

307
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:26,834
After the most invested prep?

308
00:21:27,633 --> 00:21:28,433
We'll sigh then.

309
00:21:28,533 --> 00:21:31,467
We'll wrap it up with big sighs.

310
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:35,333
That would be entertaining.

311
00:21:43,667 --> 00:21:46,633
We flipped the open sign, right?

312
00:21:50,033 --> 00:21:52,166
People will start coming after 2:30 PM.

313
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,166
But today is our last day.

314
00:22:11,266 --> 00:22:13,367
We're open, right?

315
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,800
Sir, I'd like to order one ramyeon.

316
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:20,500
Get back into the kitchen.

317
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:22,033
- What?
- Go back to the kitchen.

318
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,800
But there are no customers.

319
00:22:23,867 --> 00:22:25,166
Goodness.

320
00:22:25,233 --> 00:22:26,633
Where are the customers?

321
00:22:26,734 --> 00:22:27,734
Tell me about it.

322
00:22:28,066 --> 00:22:30,767
We've prepped the most food ever.

323
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:41,734
Oh, yeah.

324
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:47,233
Go Tae Hyung, Go Tae Hyung!

325
00:22:56,266 --> 00:22:57,533
You're just warming up, right?

326
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,200
One more time.

327
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:10,834
Nice.

328
00:23:14,266 --> 00:23:16,133
Could you dance while looking back?

329
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,333
- Turn around.
- Turn around.

330
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:18,433
Look at the camera.

331
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,467
Seo Jin, you should get him an ice cream.

332
00:23:24,934 --> 00:23:26,333
I wanna be a singer.

333
00:23:32,767 --> 00:23:33,900
From the entrance.

334
00:23:39,834 --> 00:23:42,367
The music makes a big difference.

335
00:23:42,967 --> 00:23:45,000
If we played music,
he would've danced pretty often.

336
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,500
Soon, people will rush in.

337
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:51,767
How could we have zero customers?

338
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,333
This is not a good time

339
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,100
to just goof around like this.

340
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:57,266
This is bad.

341
00:23:57,333 --> 00:24:00,100
Once people start coming in,
it's gonna be a rush.

342
00:24:00,166 --> 00:24:01,533
Goodness.

343
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,567
Seriously, what's going on?

344
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,500
Maybe people are hanging out at this time.

345
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,533
True, the weather is too good.

346
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:14,967
Because it's too good.

347
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:20,734
- By the way, Seo Jin.
- Yes?

348
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,367
Did you chant,
"Let's go for 12,000 pesos?"

349
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:24,934
Yes, and probably the most loudly.

350
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,066
Let's go for 12,000 pesos!

351
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,767
- Woo Shik.
- Yes?

352
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:38,300
The public pier? What do you say?

353
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:42,467
I heard, right now,

354
00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:45,100
there's a soccer game
between France and England.

355
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,166
Oh, that must be why.

356
00:24:47,266 --> 00:24:48,700
We didn't have French customers,

357
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,233
but we did have some English.

358
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:17,700
What…

359
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:25,533
Are you coming in? Okay.

360
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,967
You said you wanted to try something?

361
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:38,100
No, I said I've tried cheese ramyeon.

362
00:25:38,166 --> 00:25:39,266
Is it good?

363
00:25:39,333 --> 00:25:40,800
I want something with soup.

364
00:25:40,867 --> 00:25:43,200
I'd like to get one cheese ramyeon.

365
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:46,233
For drinks?

366
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:49,433
- Cokes?
- Two Cokes.

367
00:25:54,467 --> 00:25:56,767
- Take this to your table.
- Okay.

368
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:01,700
Thank you.

369
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,700
Thank you.

370
00:26:06,133 --> 00:26:07,333
Should we clink our glasses?

371
00:26:12,633 --> 00:26:14,300
Our first order's in.

372
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:19,734
One cheese ramyeon,
one half & half corn dog.

373
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:18,266
- Hola.
- Hola.

374
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:19,433
How many?

375
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,867
Two.

376
00:27:20,934 --> 00:27:22,000
There he is.

377
00:27:25,033 --> 00:27:26,500
I couldn't find you.

378
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:28,367
I was behind that corner.

379
00:27:33,767 --> 00:27:35,567
What do you recommend?

380
00:27:35,667 --> 00:27:36,667
Any recommendations?

381
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:39,700
Muy Rico.

382
00:27:40,467 --> 00:27:42,233
I don't know what to order.

383
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,333
Which one should I order?

384
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,333
I'll order ramyeon.
You order what you like.

385
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,066
I wanna try spicy fricken.

386
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,300
And I wanna try the rice menus.

387
00:27:52,266 --> 00:27:54,433
Let's order both
and take the leftovers home.

388
00:27:56,567 --> 00:27:58,900
This and spicy fricken.

389
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:01,500
Is it bulgogi or spicy pork?

390
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,633
This is beef, and this is pork.

391
00:28:03,734 --> 00:28:05,467
The pork is a little spicy.

392
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:06,567
That's even better.

393
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,233
Is it very spicy?

394
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:10,600
Just a little.

395
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,100
Do we have spicy pork rice?

396
00:28:18,166 --> 00:28:19,433
Yes, we do.

397
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,800
- An order.
- Okay.

398
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:15,667
Man, you look so chill and I hate it.

399
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,066
It's not that urgent, you know.

400
00:29:30,133 --> 00:29:31,433
I'm just trying to help.

401
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,533
- You are?
- Yes.

402
00:29:37,633 --> 00:29:39,000
Darn it.

403
00:30:09,567 --> 00:30:10,567
Ramyeon.

404
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,200
Corn dog.

405
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:15,467
It looks delicious.

406
00:30:21,667 --> 00:30:23,166
It's one of the best things I've ever had.

407
00:30:23,266 --> 00:30:25,066
- It's good, right?
- Yes, it's good.

408
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:27,467
It's a little spicy though.

409
00:30:27,533 --> 00:30:30,734
It's like it's mixed with some sauce.

410
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,066
How's your corn dog?

411
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:33,367
It has sugar on it.

412
00:30:33,934 --> 00:30:35,400
Sugar?

413
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:36,834
This is sugar. Look.

414
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,266
There's cheese inside too.

415
00:30:38,333 --> 00:30:39,367
That's amazing.

416
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,767
It's so good.

417
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:03,667
- Hellaspicy fricken.
- Thank you.

418
00:31:08,133 --> 00:31:09,600
- It's not spicy.
- It's spicy.

419
00:31:11,934 --> 00:31:12,934
It must be spicy for you.

420
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,734
I told you.

421
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,300
It's good though.

422
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:18,266
My daughter will love it.

423
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:19,367
Does she eat spicy?

424
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:21,567
Not this one, but the non-spicy one.

425
00:31:21,667 --> 00:31:23,600
How about we make
the sweet and sour sauce?

426
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:26,233
We just need some caramel
and the sauce you like.

427
00:31:26,333 --> 00:31:32,233
We can just add something sweet and sour,
like sugar and vinegar.

428
00:31:32,333 --> 00:31:34,700
Then add some spiciness to it.

429
00:31:58,467 --> 00:32:00,633
We'll add vinegar and sugar
to the sauce and caramelize it.

430
00:32:00,734 --> 00:32:02,300
It'll taste sweet and sour.

431
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,200
Which vinegar?

432
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,300
Apple vinegar.

433
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,367
Not wine. It'll be bitter.

434
00:32:11,367 --> 00:32:13,400
How much should we make
to cook this much?

435
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:17,066
About 250ml?

436
00:32:17,133 --> 00:32:20,266
With this recipe,
we can make a sweet and sour sauce.

437
00:32:20,333 --> 00:32:23,600
Then we'll put chili in.

438
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:27,100
Chili is used in most Korean sauces.

439
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,133
What should we do?

440
00:32:28,233 --> 00:32:31,467
This. I think they coated it with flour.

441
00:33:17,066 --> 00:33:18,533
Could you come scoop the rice?

442
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,934
I think there's too much meat.

443
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,000
This much?

444
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,133
A little more?

445
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,500
- Good.
- Okay.

446
00:33:34,734 --> 00:33:36,633
Is the soccer game going on now?

447
00:33:36,734 --> 00:33:38,800
Could you tell me how long it's been?

448
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:40,900
I just wanna know
when the rush will begin.

449
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,367
I wanna know what time.

450
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:44,033
You don't care about the score?

451
00:33:44,133 --> 00:33:46,367
Well, I do, but…

452
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:50,200
When the game is over,
people might start coming.

453
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:51,400
The current score is 1:1.

454
00:33:51,467 --> 00:33:52,667
The score is 1:1?

455
00:33:52,734 --> 00:33:53,967
It's 17 minutes into the 2nd half.

456
00:33:54,033 --> 00:33:55,667
I hope they don't play overtime.

457
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,467
It's 17 minutes into the 2nd half
and it's a tie? That sounds fun.

458
00:34:01,533 --> 00:34:02,867
It must be.

459
00:34:02,934 --> 00:34:05,200
It's like the finals.

460
00:34:19,467 --> 00:34:20,467
Spicy pork rice.

461
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,867
I sense some bitter taste.

462
00:34:39,967 --> 00:34:41,367
Interesting.

463
00:34:41,467 --> 00:34:43,967
There's some kind of veggie root inside.

464
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,900
Is it closed?

465
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:37,533
It's open.

466
00:35:37,567 --> 00:35:38,300
Hello.

467
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,900
What do you want?

468
00:35:44,633 --> 00:35:46,467
Sweet, spicy.

469
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:47,400
Which one do you want?

470
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,600
I don't know Korean food well.

471
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:49,600
It's my first time.

472
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,100
- First time?
- Yeah.

473
00:35:51,233 --> 00:35:53,266
- Really?
- Ask him.

474
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:54,700
Do you like spicy?

475
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,867
Uhm…

476
00:35:55,967 --> 00:35:58,200
- I do.
- It's okay.

477
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,367
We have two different kinds.

478
00:36:00,433 --> 00:36:02,700
This is sweet chili and this is spicy.

479
00:36:02,834 --> 00:36:05,333
Any recommendations for the first-timer?

480
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,567
I recommend bulgogi rice.
It's this one.

481
00:36:10,133 --> 00:36:11,100
It's beef.

482
00:36:12,233 --> 00:36:13,367
And this is chicken.

483
00:36:13,433 --> 00:36:14,934
Oh, I want this one.

484
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,033
It's our signature.

485
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,000
One spicy fricken and one gimbap please.

486
00:36:19,066 --> 00:36:20,633
This is tuna gimbap.

487
00:36:20,734 --> 00:36:22,100
- Tuna.
- You want tuna?

488
00:36:22,266 --> 00:36:24,767
- Okay, that's it?
- Yes.

489
00:36:24,867 --> 00:36:27,066
- That's it, right?
- Yes.

490
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,600
- Tuna?
- Yes.

491
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,033
- Gimbap?
- Yes.

492
00:36:57,333 --> 00:36:59,934
- Looking chill.
- Chill.

493
00:37:00,433 --> 00:37:03,000
Chill, chill.

494
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,967
- Could you prepare the sauce for me?
- Sure.

495
00:37:10,266 --> 00:37:12,333
The tuna is done really nicely today.

496
00:37:12,867 --> 00:37:14,567
- Not like other days?
- No.

497
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,300
For the first time, it's dry.

498
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:18,033
- Did you make it?
- No.

499
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,100
What was that?

500
00:37:58,867 --> 00:37:59,867
"How is it?"

501
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:04,300
It means, "Is everything okay?"

502
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:09,700
Could I take a look?

503
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:13,600
Don't you think you started this too late?

504
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:28,066
To… Todo esta bien?

505
00:38:34,767 --> 00:38:35,767
Todo esta bien?

506
00:38:35,867 --> 00:38:37,633
Yes, very good.

507
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:39,667
- Is it spicy?
- It's okay.

508
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:46,266
Necesita mandil?

509
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,166
Necesita mandil?

510
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:51,500
"Do you need an apron?"

511
00:38:52,133 --> 00:38:53,266
Go on and try it.

512
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,967
Bring an apron with you.

513
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:10,367
Uh… Nece… Necesita mandil?

514
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,667
- Oh, no.
- No?

515
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,867
Necesita mandil.

516
00:39:22,934 --> 00:39:24,633
- "Do you need an apron?"
- "Nece?"

517
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,967
Or "re?

518
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:31,233
- We started learning Spanish.
- Got it.

519
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,667
Nece?

520
00:39:32,734 --> 00:39:33,867
Necesita.

521
00:39:33,934 --> 00:39:35,033
- Necesita.
- Nece?

522
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,133
- Ne.
- Ne.

523
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,133
- Ce.
- Ce.

524
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,934
Sita.

525
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,734
Necesita mandil?

526
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:41,734
Nece.

527
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,066
Necesita mandil?

528
00:39:47,166 --> 00:39:48,567
- Ne.
- Ne.

529
00:39:48,667 --> 00:39:50,133
- Nece.
- Yes, like that.

530
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:51,600
Necesita mandil?

531
00:39:51,934 --> 00:39:53,300
Necesita mandil?

532
00:39:56,533 --> 00:39:58,367
One. Just one.

533
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,600
Necesita mandil?

534
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:01,867
Mandil?

535
00:40:01,934 --> 00:40:03,934
No?

536
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,133
- An apron.
- Oh, apron.

537
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,700
No, but thank you.

538
00:40:11,533 --> 00:40:13,567
Woo Shik. This is for the skyblue table.

539
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,266
What's "thank you" in Korean?

540
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:21,567
Gamsahabnida.

541
00:40:21,667 --> 00:40:23,100
- Gamsa.
- Gamsa.

542
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,033
- Habnida.
- Habnida.

543
00:40:27,734 --> 00:40:28,734
Cheers?

544
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,166
Cheers.

545
00:40:30,333 --> 00:40:31,734
I wonder what it is in Korean.

546
00:40:32,233 --> 00:40:34,800
What's "cheers" in Korean?

547
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:35,934
Geonbae.

548
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,667
Geonbae.

549
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,200
- Geonbae.
- Geonbae.

550
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:42,700
Enjoy.

551
00:40:43,967 --> 00:40:45,300
Buen provecho.

552
00:40:46,367 --> 00:40:47,867
I'm excited.

553
00:40:54,033 --> 00:40:56,600
I like the Korean flavor.

554
00:40:56,667 --> 00:40:57,867
But it's spicy.

555
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:01,633
It's hot inside.

556
00:41:01,867 --> 00:41:03,767
I love spicy food.

557
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,867
Oh, yeah. I love it.

558
00:41:13,066 --> 00:41:14,433
- Mandil.
- Mandil.

559
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,900
One half & half corn dog.

560
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,834
Nice.

561
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:47,533
I'll put the sauce on it.

562
00:42:13,333 --> 00:42:14,767
This one's to-go.

563
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,700
I don't know what to do next.

564
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,066
This,

565
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,467
this, and this, right?

566
00:42:29,567 --> 00:42:30,800
This,

567
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:34,633
then this, and this.

568
00:42:35,533 --> 00:42:36,934
I'm not sure if I can do it though.

569
00:42:58,867 --> 00:42:59,834
Is this right?

570
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,533
Tae Hyung, are you making it?

571
00:43:03,433 --> 00:43:04,333
Huh?

572
00:43:04,433 --> 00:43:05,500
You're good.

573
00:43:08,767 --> 00:43:11,166
Seo Jun is busy, so I'm just trying.

574
00:43:11,567 --> 00:43:12,600
You're good.

575
00:43:25,233 --> 00:43:26,500
I hope it turns out okay.

576
00:43:34,367 --> 00:43:35,367
What is it?

577
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,133
A half & half corn dog.

578
00:43:37,233 --> 00:43:38,100
Oh, did you make it?

579
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,467
I gave it a shot.

580
00:43:40,667 --> 00:43:41,767
Is it round?

581
00:43:42,033 --> 00:43:43,633
- What?
- Did the cheese come out?

582
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:45,433
- No, it didn't.
- I see.

583
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,900
I'm worried though.

584
00:43:48,533 --> 00:43:50,266
- So exciting. Your first time?
- Yes.

585
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,233
It's my first corn dog.

586
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,166
I didn't practice this in Korea.

587
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:56,033
I just went by memory.

588
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,200
- It looks nice.
- Huh?

589
00:43:57,266 --> 00:43:58,400
It looks pretty nice.

590
00:43:58,467 --> 00:44:00,066
I hope it turns out okay.

591
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:10,200
It's got horns.

592
00:44:12,934 --> 00:44:13,900
It's got horns.

593
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,900
- Huh?
- It's got horns.

594
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,400
What do you think?

595
00:44:39,667 --> 00:44:40,667
Cute.

596
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,867
- Hola.
- Hola.

597
00:45:23,967 --> 00:45:25,066
Hola.

598
00:45:25,133 --> 00:45:26,700
- How many?
- Two.

599
00:45:26,767 --> 00:45:27,834
There, there…

600
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,066
Sit anywhere you like.

601
00:45:29,133 --> 00:45:30,300
- There?
- Anywhere is fine.

602
00:45:30,367 --> 00:45:31,367
There then.

603
00:45:32,467 --> 00:45:35,000
Sir, please order here.

604
00:45:35,433 --> 00:45:36,333
Por favor.

605
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,600
Do we order here?

606
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:43,834
Order. Yes.

607
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,900
Very good. Muy Rico.

608
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:50,033
Here's the sample.

609
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:53,633
They are gimbap, chibap,

610
00:45:53,734 --> 00:45:54,767
and bulgogi rice.

611
00:45:54,867 --> 00:45:56,700
Beef, chicken.

612
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:58,834
I'm looking for something spicy.

613
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,900
Spicy?

614
00:46:01,867 --> 00:46:02,734
It's spicy.

615
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,800
I'll go with that.

616
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,467
One spicy fricken.

617
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:07,467
And... This one.

618
00:46:07,533 --> 00:46:09,233
- Bulgogi rice?
- Bulgogi rice.

619
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:10,600
And ramyeon.

620
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:12,700
- One more ramyeon?
- Yes.

621
00:46:12,867 --> 00:46:15,233
- Two?
- Yes.

622
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,266
Thank you.

623
00:46:32,133 --> 00:46:33,367
Thank you.

624
00:46:33,433 --> 00:46:34,433
You're welcome.

625
00:46:34,667 --> 00:46:36,333
We ordered the super spicy chicken.
Let's see.

626
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,800
- You'll be like this.
- He said it's super spicy.

627
00:46:38,867 --> 00:46:39,734
We'll see.

628
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,867
I'm a Mexican macho, so I must do it.

629
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:46,767
- Hellaspicy fricken.
- Hellaspicy fricken.

630
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:06,567
Before, I couldn't even smell
the hell sauce.

631
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:07,934
Because it's too spicy.

632
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,900
But now, it smells so good to me.

633
00:47:38,867 --> 00:47:40,433
These are pickles.

634
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,433
Oh.

635
00:47:41,867 --> 00:47:44,066
- Picante.
- Gracias.

636
00:47:44,767 --> 00:47:47,166
- It smells good.
- It looks great.

637
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:50,200
- What was this again?
- It looks like radish.

638
00:47:50,266 --> 00:47:51,900
- What did he say it was?
- Jicama?

639
00:47:51,967 --> 00:47:53,467
I didn't hear him.

640
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,867
- Enjoy.
- No, I'll wait.

641
00:47:57,934 --> 00:47:58,800
Let's start with yours.

642
00:47:58,900 --> 00:48:01,033
- You can have mine later too.
- Oh, okay.

643
00:48:01,934 --> 00:48:03,266
It's supposed to be spicy.

644
00:48:08,166 --> 00:48:09,233
Isn't it hot?

645
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,300
It's not spicy.

646
00:48:13,367 --> 00:48:14,767
- No?
- It's sweet.

647
00:48:14,834 --> 00:48:15,834
Let me…

648
00:48:16,266 --> 00:48:18,233
Kidding. It's spicy.

649
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,033
You…

650
00:48:26,767 --> 00:48:28,166
- Just like you.
- Yeah.

651
00:48:30,433 --> 00:48:32,333
It went into my nose.

652
00:48:33,934 --> 00:48:35,400
It's so spicy.

653
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,600
You're so mean.

654
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:47,066
- Is it spicy for them?
- Too spicy.

655
00:48:47,133 --> 00:48:48,867
Your face is all red now.

656
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:02,667
This is…

657
00:49:03,467 --> 00:49:05,900
- For cooling down the heat?
- Yes, for cooling it down.

658
00:49:07,066 --> 00:49:08,066
Radish?

659
00:49:08,166 --> 00:49:09,400
I'll eat the chicken first.

660
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:13,800
Just a little.

661
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:20,700
It's spicy.

662
00:49:21,867 --> 00:49:23,867
I don't eat spicy at all.

663
00:49:25,066 --> 00:49:26,834
We don't have this kind of sauce
in our country.

664
00:50:12,266 --> 00:50:13,266
There.

665
00:50:21,667 --> 00:50:22,633
Is everything all right?

666
00:50:22,700 --> 00:50:24,600
Yes, thank you.

667
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:26,433
- Muy…
- Yes, spicy.

668
00:50:26,500 --> 00:50:28,834
- Very spicy?
- No, not too spicy. It's good.

669
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:29,967
For me, it is.

670
00:50:30,767 --> 00:50:32,233
I hope ramyeon isn't as spicy.

671
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:36,800
- Spicy?
- No.

672
00:50:39,633 --> 00:50:40,700
It's good.

673
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:44,667
I'll steal some.

674
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:55,867
Bulgogi rice.

675
00:50:57,600 --> 00:50:59,300
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

676
00:50:59,367 --> 00:51:00,433
This will cool down the heat.

677
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,066
Right.

678
00:51:02,133 --> 00:51:03,533
Is my face still red?

679
00:51:07,834 --> 00:51:08,867
Maybe I can pick up the meat.

680
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:12,867
Oh, no. It's slipping.

681
00:51:16,266 --> 00:51:17,867
I'll teach you how to use them.

682
00:51:17,967 --> 00:51:20,100
The meat is really good.

683
00:51:22,333 --> 00:51:23,333
It's good, right?

684
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,467
Yes, it's good.

685
00:51:26,867 --> 00:51:28,767
I want to ask them about the recipe.

686
00:51:33,633 --> 00:51:35,033
That one's really spicy.

687
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:37,166
It's still burning in my mouth.

688
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,533
Now, everything tastes spicy.

689
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,533
The Coke is spicy!

690
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,900
It's spicy Coke! It's red!

691
00:51:46,633 --> 00:51:49,100
No spicy, no flavor.

692
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,967
Do you want some egg?

693
00:52:04,767 --> 00:52:05,767
Do you want the egg?

694
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,767
Sorry, I thought I cooled it down.

695
00:52:11,834 --> 00:52:14,100
- That was so mean.
- I really blew on it.

696
00:52:14,166 --> 00:52:16,900
Gosh, that was so hot.

697
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,166
That was a revenge, right?

698
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,400
- Because of the spicy chicken, right?
- No.

699
00:52:27,967 --> 00:52:30,233
That was silly of me.

700
00:52:30,333 --> 00:52:32,000
You were like a dragon trapped
in a castle.

701
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,633
The egg is okay now. Try it.

702
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:41,100
It was so hot earlier.

703
00:52:41,166 --> 00:52:42,500
After the spicy chicken,
it felt even hotter.

704
00:52:42,567 --> 00:52:44,033
Right. Because your tongue was sensitive.

705
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:45,633
My tongue was like, "Ahh"

706
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:47,100
"Help me!"

707
00:53:19,133 --> 00:53:21,467
We don't know when the chicken orders
will start rushing in.

708
00:53:27,266 --> 00:53:29,767
Hold one. How much chicken meat

709
00:53:29,867 --> 00:53:31,066
did we fry today?

710
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:32,633
I'll fry these all.

711
00:53:33,133 --> 00:53:36,633
At this rate, I'm afraid
we'll have to finish it again.

712
00:53:36,734 --> 00:53:40,000
Yay! Another chibap dinner!

713
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:10,800
Thank you.

714
00:54:15,467 --> 00:54:16,600
It's dough.

715
00:54:17,533 --> 00:54:19,300
It's like doughnut dough.

716
00:54:19,834 --> 00:54:20,834
It's good.

717
00:54:21,333 --> 00:54:23,433
We didn't give them tip, did we?

718
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:24,567
Let's leave it here.

719
00:54:25,567 --> 00:54:26,800
Put the 100 pesos here.

720
00:54:27,667 --> 00:54:28,867
Thank you.

721
00:54:28,934 --> 00:54:30,867
We put the tip here.

722
00:54:31,033 --> 00:54:32,967
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

723
00:54:42,467 --> 00:54:44,333
Yu Mi, this…

724
00:54:44,433 --> 00:54:45,300
Yu Mi.

725
00:54:45,467 --> 00:54:47,066
Why are you taking the money?

726
00:54:47,767 --> 00:54:49,533
- Yay!
- Huh?

727
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:51,467
Did your corn dog turn out all right?

728
00:54:51,533 --> 00:54:52,800
It turned out all right.

729
00:54:55,467 --> 00:54:56,734
Thanks.

730
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,834
- Is it my allowance?
- What about the coins?

731
00:54:57,900 --> 00:54:59,033
- Huh?
- The coins.

732
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:00,133
The coins…

733
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:01,433
The coins are here.

734
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,700
We got lots of coins too.

735
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,300
Yu Mi just tried to steal it.

736
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,967
He fried the corn dog well.

737
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,600
- What is it?
- The tips.

738
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:15,967
- Tips?
- Yes.

739
00:55:16,066 --> 00:55:17,734
They left it there.

740
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:20,300
That's a lot of tip.

741
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,000
Hey, why did you open it?

742
00:55:22,066 --> 00:55:22,934
- Tae Hyung.
- Yes?

743
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,967
Why did you open the cash drawer?

744
00:55:24,033 --> 00:55:25,600
I just did. No reason.

745
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:26,600
You…

746
00:55:26,667 --> 00:55:28,200
Did you put something in your pocket?

747
00:55:28,266 --> 00:55:29,233
No, I didn't.

748
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:30,233
- Really?
- No!

749
00:55:30,300 --> 00:55:31,333
Why would you open the cash drawer?

750
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:33,867
- I only have 20.
- Huh?

751
00:55:33,934 --> 00:55:34,800
Isn't it 200?

752
00:55:34,867 --> 00:55:36,467
- I have only 20 pesos.
- What's this?

753
00:55:37,233 --> 00:55:39,133
- I didn't open it.
- What is it?

754
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,667
- What is it?
- Why'd you open it?

755
00:55:40,734 --> 00:55:43,033
I was just curious. That's all.

756
00:55:43,133 --> 00:55:44,667
He's so suspicious.

757
00:55:45,433 --> 00:55:46,734
Where did you get that money?

758
00:55:46,834 --> 00:55:48,600
- Yu Mi gave it to me.
- I gave it to him.

759
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,066
For making a nice corn dog.

760
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:53,567
- You keep touching the cash drawer.
- Gosh.

761
00:55:53,667 --> 00:55:54,767
This is so unfair.

762
00:55:54,867 --> 00:55:57,266
I just wanted to see how it looks.

763
00:55:57,333 --> 00:55:59,567
You have nothing to do
with the cash drawer.

764
00:55:59,633 --> 00:56:00,667
I just…

765
00:56:00,734 --> 00:56:03,200
- I just wanted to see it.
- Keep it in your pocket.

766
00:56:03,266 --> 00:56:04,867
He suddenly sneaked up.

767
00:56:04,934 --> 00:56:06,500
Buy a Coke at the airport later.

768
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,934
The tips are mine anyway.

769
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:13,767
I just wanted to see
how the cash drawer opens.

770
00:56:14,033 --> 00:56:16,166
Then he suddenly looked at me like this.

771
00:56:17,066 --> 00:56:19,233
Gosh, people here don't trust me.

772
00:56:20,066 --> 00:56:21,066
Wow.

773
00:56:22,066 --> 00:56:25,467
How could he suspect me?
This is so unfair.

774
00:56:25,567 --> 00:56:26,934
- It's a tip.
- Then why?

775
00:56:27,767 --> 00:56:29,133
Okay, keep it there then.

776
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:30,667
We don't need it now.

777
00:56:30,834 --> 00:56:31,900
Here. Have one.

778
00:56:32,367 --> 00:56:35,100
- Let's buy some Coke.
- We need 20-peso bills.

779
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,500
Why?

780
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:41,000
What's your deal?

781
00:56:41,066 --> 00:56:42,200
I just…

782
00:56:42,266 --> 00:56:44,066
You kids keep trying to touch it.

783
00:56:45,300 --> 00:56:46,934
You can take that… No, not that.

784
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:47,934
Just take this.

785
00:56:54,734 --> 00:56:56,066
Hola.

786
00:56:56,166 --> 00:56:57,233
Hola.

787
00:56:57,367 --> 00:56:58,567
How many?

788
00:56:58,667 --> 00:56:59,834
One.

789
00:56:59,934 --> 00:57:01,400
Order here please.

790
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:03,000
Hmm.

791
00:57:03,266 --> 00:57:04,600
This menu's sample is here.

792
00:57:05,767 --> 00:57:07,133
Here.

793
00:57:09,367 --> 00:57:10,233
It's really good.

794
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:11,934
Muy Rico.

795
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:14,567
I'll order this one.

796
00:57:14,633 --> 00:57:16,633
- One of this?
- Yes.

797
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:17,533
Okay.

798
00:57:23,133 --> 00:57:24,533
Do you wanna sit over there?

799
00:57:24,633 --> 00:57:25,633
Sure.

800
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:32,166
Bulgogi rice.

801
00:57:32,967 --> 00:57:34,333
- Just one?
- Yes.

802
00:57:34,433 --> 00:57:36,800
I'm good at this now.

803
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:47,900
I'll give her lots of meat.

804
00:57:47,967 --> 00:57:49,300
- Lots of meat.
- Yes.

805
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:24,767
Thank you.

806
00:58:43,667 --> 00:58:45,900
I love it so much I can't stop dancing.

807
00:58:52,066 --> 00:58:53,133
Doesn't your mouth feel numb?

808
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:55,700
Yes, it does. It feels so numb.

809
00:58:55,767 --> 00:58:58,300
- I can see that.
- I can't feel my tongue now.

810
00:58:59,133 --> 00:59:00,433
Put some ice on it.

811
00:59:02,133 --> 00:59:03,834
I'm so happy now.

812
00:59:03,934 --> 00:59:05,567
I wish the chicken won't go away.

813
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:07,834
Oh, honey.
We can order more if you want.

814
00:59:07,934 --> 00:59:10,433
If so, let's ask them the sauce recipe.

815
00:59:11,467 --> 00:59:12,867
So Koreans like spicy

816
00:59:12,967 --> 00:59:16,800
like us Mexicans.

817
00:59:16,867 --> 00:59:18,533
It's a different spicy though.

818
00:59:18,600 --> 00:59:20,233
So good, I don't want the last piece.

819
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,533
You want it? We can share.

820
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,734
No, I can't…

821
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:23,667
Then I'll eat it.

822
00:59:23,734 --> 00:59:24,867
Enjoy.

823
00:59:24,934 --> 00:59:26,633
Mission complete!

824
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:29,967
It's my last chicken piece,
but I can give it to you.

825
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,000
Then give me just the half.

826
00:59:39,533 --> 00:59:40,367
It was so good.

827
00:59:40,467 --> 00:59:41,300
I'm full.

828
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:43,367
You should roll me out of here.

829
00:59:43,467 --> 00:59:44,667
Or on a cart.

830
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:47,734
Ask the doughnut guy
if we can borrow his motorbike.

831
00:59:47,934 --> 00:59:50,900
"If I can't finish the food,
can I have the rest to-go?"

832
00:59:50,967 --> 00:59:51,900
"I brought a container."

833
00:59:51,967 --> 00:59:52,934
"I brought a container. Look here."

834
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:54,100
I can put it in my bag.

835
00:59:59,767 --> 01:00:01,200
Thank you so much.

836
01:00:01,266 --> 01:00:02,533
What is it?

837
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,600
Dessert.

838
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,266
It's made with sticky rice and honey.

839
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:08,100
That sounds great for our burning mouths.

840
01:00:08,166 --> 01:00:10,867
Hopefully this sweet will cool it down.

841
01:00:14,066 --> 01:00:15,233
Let me try it too.

842
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:17,266
- Thank, God.
- It smells good.

843
01:00:19,066 --> 01:00:20,967
It's cooling down my tongue.

844
01:00:21,066 --> 01:00:22,300
Gosh, I'm almost done.

845
01:00:22,734 --> 01:00:24,333
"Can I have more of the dessert?"

846
01:00:24,867 --> 01:00:26,967
"I want a box of it."

847
01:00:29,100 --> 01:00:29,967
Do you want mine?

848
01:00:31,000 --> 01:00:33,133
- You're so mean!
- Done.

849
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:34,633
You should've been fast.

850
01:00:34,934 --> 01:00:36,133
Just you wait.

851
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,900
When asked about Korean food,
I'll always yes.

852
01:00:38,967 --> 01:00:40,967
We should ask them
to open one near our place.

853
01:00:41,834 --> 01:00:42,867
"Please!"

854
01:00:42,967 --> 01:00:43,934
I should leave a note that goes,

855
01:00:44,033 --> 01:00:46,300
"This is my address.
Open a restaurant next to it."

856
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,500
Yeah, we need it.

857
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,834
We barely hit 2,000 now.

858
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:57,900
What do we do?

859
01:00:58,233 --> 01:00:59,300
- Huh?
- What do we do?

860
01:00:59,367 --> 01:01:00,667
- What do you mean?
- We should make 12,000…

861
01:01:00,734 --> 01:01:02,633
I mean, 10,000. We must make 10,000 more.

862
01:01:03,467 --> 01:01:04,967
Why is it going so slow today?

863
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,200
Let's go for 12,000!

864
01:01:18,567 --> 01:01:20,500
We just hit 2,000.

865
01:01:20,567 --> 01:01:22,700
We need 10,000 more pesos to make.

866
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,100
Seriously, no one's coming.

867
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:49,834
The rush will begin after the game.

868
01:01:49,934 --> 01:01:51,200
- The game's over.
- It is?

869
01:01:51,266 --> 01:01:52,333
France won.

870
01:01:53,233 --> 01:01:54,400
France won.

871
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,133
Should we take out the trash?

872
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,400
I'll do it.

873
01:02:01,967 --> 01:02:02,967
Sir.

874
01:02:03,467 --> 01:02:04,767
Should we close here?

875
01:02:06,266 --> 01:02:08,133
Our restaurant, I mean.

876
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:09,433
How could no one come?

877
01:02:09,533 --> 01:02:11,066
Oh, someone's coming.

878
01:02:16,166 --> 01:02:17,467
This is usually a slow time.

879
01:02:30,667 --> 01:02:32,533
- Hola.
- Hola.

880
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,300
Hola.

881
01:02:55,400 --> 01:02:57,300
One corn dog

882
01:02:57,367 --> 01:02:58,533
and one ramyeon please.

883
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,633
One ramyeon.

884
01:03:01,834 --> 01:03:03,900
- That'd be 240 pesos.
- Okay. Wait.

885
01:03:06,667 --> 01:03:08,934
ORDER SLIP!

886
01:03:09,166 --> 01:03:11,133
Should I try making the corn dog?

887
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,266
Try it.

888
01:03:12,333 --> 01:03:13,567
I'll demonstrate once.

889
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:20,033
One, two, three.
Roll it quickly three times.

890
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:22,633
Otherwise, it'll drop.

891
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:24,400
One.

892
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:25,567
Two.

893
01:03:25,667 --> 01:03:27,033
Three.

894
01:03:27,133 --> 01:03:30,934
Roll it here and gently massage it.

895
01:03:33,967 --> 01:03:35,133
Try yourself.

896
01:03:36,233 --> 01:03:37,567
One,

897
01:03:37,633 --> 01:03:39,734
two, three.

898
01:03:43,967 --> 01:03:44,934
Did it go all right?

899
01:03:48,433 --> 01:03:49,567
How is the rice?

900
01:03:49,633 --> 01:03:50,934
- It's nice.
- Nice.

901
01:03:51,033 --> 01:03:51,900
- Is it done all right?
- Yes.

902
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,066
Nice. Enjoy.

903
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:08,700
Man.

904
01:04:09,734 --> 01:04:12,033
This looks gorgeous.

905
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:15,533
The chef is definitely different.

906
01:04:23,133 --> 01:04:24,633
It's become a pork cutlet.

907
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,533
Oh.

908
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:31,066
Oh.

909
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:32,934
Oh.

910
01:04:36,967 --> 01:04:40,333
- For you? Oh, okay.
- Thank you.

911
01:04:43,300 --> 01:04:45,500
I guess you should just bite it, right?

912
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:53,900
Try this. I'll leave you some.

913
01:04:55,333 --> 01:04:57,266
That's a lot of noodles.

914
01:05:00,233 --> 01:05:01,300
It's so hot.

915
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,333
It's good. It's quite spicy though.

916
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:10,900
What is it?

917
01:05:10,967 --> 01:05:12,000
The corn dog I made.

918
01:05:12,066 --> 01:05:13,100
Is it a failure?

919
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:15,000
No, it's for you.

920
01:05:15,066 --> 01:05:16,633
- For us?
- Yes.

921
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:19,066
- It's for us.
- Okay.

922
01:05:19,133 --> 01:05:20,834
- Eat it while working.
- Okay.

923
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:27,533
- Tae Hyung.
- Yes?

924
01:05:28,934 --> 01:05:30,100
Is it okay? Muy bien?

925
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,400
Muy bien.

926
01:05:32,033 --> 01:05:33,233
- Todo esta bien?
- Yes.

927
01:05:44,734 --> 01:05:46,367
What are you doing?

928
01:05:50,333 --> 01:05:51,200
What do we do?

929
01:05:51,300 --> 01:05:52,200
- Huh?
- What do we do?

930
01:05:52,266 --> 01:05:53,266
What do you mean?

931
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:56,000
What do you mean?

932
01:05:56,066 --> 01:05:58,000
What will you do?

933
01:05:58,066 --> 01:05:59,900
Let's take it slow.

934
01:05:59,967 --> 01:06:02,700
Take it slow and keep working
until we hit 10,000?

935
01:06:02,767 --> 01:06:04,300
I won't close the restaurant.

936
01:06:05,233 --> 01:06:06,166
Tell Tae Hyung

937
01:06:06,266 --> 01:06:07,667
he might have to work until he goes home.

938
01:06:08,367 --> 01:06:09,200
Okay?

939
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:15,600
There's been an announcement
from the boss.

940
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:18,533
Until we hit 10,000 today,

941
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,734
our restaurant will be open.

942
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:23,934
What?

943
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:26,834
Well…

944
01:06:26,934 --> 01:06:29,300
He told me to tell you

945
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,567
you might not be able
to go back to Korea.

946
01:06:34,266 --> 01:06:35,233
Today…

947
01:06:37,767 --> 01:06:39,867
We're not closing today.

948
01:06:40,433 --> 01:06:43,433
Wait, why did you fry all the chicken?

949
01:06:43,533 --> 01:06:44,367
I fried them all.

950
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,300
Hola.

951
01:07:03,367 --> 01:07:04,800
- A table for three?
- Yes.

952
01:07:04,867 --> 01:07:07,000
- Hi.
- Hello.

953
01:07:07,066 --> 01:07:08,834
Are you coming back from swimming?

954
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:10,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

955
01:07:13,266 --> 01:07:15,133
One basic ramyeon.

956
01:07:15,233 --> 01:07:16,166
Okay.

957
01:07:16,266 --> 01:07:17,567
For me, one cheese ramyeon.

958
01:07:17,667 --> 01:07:19,633
- I'll also have one cheese ramyeon.
- Cheese ramyeon.

959
01:07:24,633 --> 01:07:27,166
- That'll be 380 pesos.
- Okay.

960
01:07:27,233 --> 01:07:28,533
- Did you pay?
- Yes.

961
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,633
I'll give the money to you right away.

962
01:07:29,700 --> 01:07:30,567
- Here's your change.
- Thank you.

963
01:07:30,633 --> 01:07:32,867
- Could you take this to the table?
- Yes.

964
01:07:32,934 --> 01:07:34,900
- Thank you.
- And I'd like…

965
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:37,333
- This one was well?
- One more?

966
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:38,967
- Hey, we have tuna gimbap.
- Okay.

967
01:07:41,734 --> 01:07:43,000
When did you open the store?

968
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,200
Last week.

969
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:46,133
- Last week?
- But we're closing today.

970
01:07:46,233 --> 01:07:47,800
- Why?
- Today is the last day.

971
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:48,800
Why?

972
01:07:48,900 --> 01:07:50,600
- We have to go back.
- We have to go back.

973
01:07:51,166 --> 01:07:52,967
- Where are you guys from?
- Germany.

974
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:54,567
What are you talking about?

975
01:07:54,667 --> 01:07:56,367
They're closing. It's their last day.

976
01:07:56,467 --> 01:07:57,433
Really?

977
01:07:57,500 --> 01:07:58,734
How long have you been here for?

978
01:07:58,800 --> 01:07:59,867
One week.

979
01:07:59,934 --> 01:08:01,967
Only one week? Where are you up to next?

980
01:08:02,033 --> 01:08:03,166
We're going back.

981
01:08:03,233 --> 01:08:04,700
- Back to Korea?
- Yes.

982
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,433
Give it to them
so they can do it while waiting.

983
01:08:13,333 --> 01:08:14,934
Did you guys watch Squid Game?

984
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,633
Yes.

985
01:08:16,734 --> 01:08:17,633
No, not me..

986
01:08:17,734 --> 01:08:19,867
You haven't watched it yet?

987
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,967
Green light, red light!

988
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:26,900
I wonder what he's bringing.

989
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Oh, it's the thing made with sugar.

990
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:32,066
- Oh, made with sugar?
- Yes.

991
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:34,033
- What is it?
- It's a pin.

992
01:08:34,266 --> 01:08:35,100
What do we do with the pin?

993
01:08:35,200 --> 01:08:39,200
In this game, we must cut certain shapes
out of the cookie.

994
01:08:39,266 --> 01:08:40,667
Using this pin only.

995
01:08:40,734 --> 01:08:43,633
If you break it
or can't finish it in time, you die.

996
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,400
Look. I was lucky.

997
01:08:53,500 --> 01:08:54,934
A circle.

998
01:08:55,367 --> 01:08:56,600
I got an umbrella.

999
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:59,200
We randomly get one shape out of four,

1000
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:02,700
and that's the hardest one,
which killed the most people.

1001
01:09:02,767 --> 01:09:05,633
What do I do now? Take it out and?

1002
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:08,600
And cut out the shape.

1003
01:09:08,667 --> 01:09:11,066
I'm so scared. I'm gonna die.

1004
01:09:11,133 --> 01:09:12,300
Mine is broken.

1005
01:09:12,367 --> 01:09:13,734
Oh, you're dead.

1006
01:09:17,567 --> 01:09:18,600
Oh, you're dead.

1007
01:09:24,533 --> 01:09:26,333
- What happened?
- He broke it while pulling it out.

1008
01:09:28,233 --> 01:09:29,667
You broke it already?

1009
01:09:29,767 --> 01:09:30,900
Yes, he's dead.

1010
01:09:32,600 --> 01:09:34,033
He broke it while taking it out.

1011
01:09:34,133 --> 01:09:35,367
So I killed him.

1012
01:09:37,100 --> 01:09:38,934
- It's so hard.
- It is.

1013
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:40,800
You're already dead.

1014
01:09:45,567 --> 01:09:46,700
Just like that game.

1015
01:09:46,767 --> 01:09:47,633
Yes, right.

1016
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:50,100
- Try it after your meal.
- Thank you.

1017
01:09:50,166 --> 01:09:52,166
Have you watched Squid Game?

1018
01:09:52,266 --> 01:09:53,100
No.

1019
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:59,133
You're supposed to cut out the shape.

1020
01:09:59,233 --> 01:10:03,433
If you fail, you die.

1021
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:05,066
So extreme, right?

1022
01:10:05,166 --> 01:10:06,767
So that's what they're talking about.

1023
01:10:12,233 --> 01:10:14,667
- No way!
- It's so cute.

1024
01:10:17,667 --> 01:10:18,834
Let's see.

1025
01:10:20,934 --> 01:10:22,166
It's so cute.

1026
01:10:22,233 --> 01:10:24,400
Honey, you should've put
a wedding ring here.

1027
01:10:26,767 --> 01:10:28,600
Let's start over.

1028
01:10:28,667 --> 01:10:31,633
Honey, do you know what happens
when it breaks?

1029
01:10:31,734 --> 01:10:32,834
I know. It's scary.

1030
01:10:32,934 --> 01:10:33,834
The music will start playing.

1031
01:10:37,133 --> 01:10:39,667
Maybe we can't get out of here if we fail.

1032
01:10:40,900 --> 01:10:42,100
They gave us the heart shape
because we're a couple.

1033
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:43,533
Because we're a couple.

1034
01:10:56,166 --> 01:10:58,033
Since they went swimming,

1035
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,800
they're craving some soup.

1036
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:01,433
Okay.

1037
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:03,100
Okay.

1038
01:11:03,967 --> 01:11:05,166
Okay.

1039
01:11:05,266 --> 01:11:06,834
- Open it please.
- Okay.

1040
01:11:06,934 --> 01:11:09,734
When I put the noodles in, add that.

1041
01:11:09,834 --> 01:11:11,433
- Okay.
- Good.

1042
01:11:38,934 --> 01:11:41,200
- Thank you.
- Honey, look.

1043
01:11:42,433 --> 01:11:43,533
It's gimbap.

1044
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:46,533
- Gimbap.
- They make it here.

1045
01:11:46,567 --> 01:11:49,367
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1046
01:12:20,066 --> 01:12:22,233
You're finished just in time.

1047
01:12:27,100 --> 01:12:28,367
I know this is random,

1048
01:12:28,433 --> 01:12:33,433
but I think the server is a famous person.

1049
01:12:36,467 --> 01:12:38,633
With cheese?

1050
01:12:38,700 --> 01:12:39,867
Those two.

1051
01:12:40,734 --> 01:12:42,533
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1052
01:12:42,567 --> 01:12:45,433
Oh, it looks good.

1053
01:12:52,066 --> 01:12:53,433
I broke one edge.

1054
01:12:53,533 --> 01:12:54,767
- You're dead.
- You're dead.

1055
01:12:58,600 --> 01:13:00,166
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1056
01:13:00,233 --> 01:13:01,834
It smells so good.

1057
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:04,200
It looks so good.
Does it have tofu inside?

1058
01:13:04,266 --> 01:13:05,433
No, tuna.

1059
01:13:10,066 --> 01:13:11,233
Would you like to try one?

1060
01:13:11,300 --> 01:13:12,900
Sure.

1061
01:13:12,967 --> 01:13:14,300
I felt your gaze.

1062
01:13:14,367 --> 01:13:16,300
- Which sauce is better?
- Try both.

1063
01:13:20,934 --> 01:13:21,900
It's good.

1064
01:13:25,867 --> 01:13:27,400
He might be an actor.

1065
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:29,900
- He might.
- On Squid Game.

1066
01:13:29,967 --> 01:13:31,633
Maybe that's why I thought he was famous.

1067
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,300
No, he looks totally different.

1068
01:13:35,700 --> 01:13:37,467
The Squid Game actor was much older.

1069
01:13:37,533 --> 01:13:39,433
I think he was in his 40s.

1070
01:13:42,734 --> 01:13:44,166
It's so tasty.

1071
01:13:45,133 --> 01:13:47,000
I'd love to visit Korea.

1072
01:13:48,734 --> 01:13:50,667
When are we going to Korea?

1073
01:13:50,767 --> 01:13:51,867
Someday.

1074
01:13:51,967 --> 01:13:52,900
The funny thing is

1075
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,767
the only thing I know about Korea is
its capital city.

1076
01:13:54,867 --> 01:13:56,533
I know Busan.

1077
01:13:56,633 --> 01:13:58,533
The second biggest city.

1078
01:13:58,633 --> 01:14:00,367
But Seoul…

1079
01:14:00,467 --> 01:14:02,400
Seoul must be a great city.

1080
01:14:02,500 --> 01:14:04,900
We'll probably need one whole week
for Seoul

1081
01:14:04,967 --> 01:14:06,367
to see things properly.

1082
01:14:06,967 --> 01:14:09,834
I'd spend lots of time
in the internet cafe.

1083
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:14,433
Watching the soccer games and all
with the people.

1084
01:14:14,500 --> 01:14:15,834
The gaming culture is huge there.

1085
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:18,800
One of the biggest in the world.

1086
01:14:18,867 --> 01:14:20,367
They have the best gamers.

1087
01:14:20,433 --> 01:14:22,500
Koreans are so serious about video games.

1088
01:14:22,567 --> 01:14:25,133
Like we're serious about soccer.

1089
01:14:25,233 --> 01:14:26,266
Right.

1090
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,567
This is gonna take five years at least.

1091
01:14:49,767 --> 01:14:50,934
I'm dead.

1092
01:14:57,567 --> 01:14:58,734
Look, she did it.

1093
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:02,934
Mine's a little broken too.

1094
01:15:03,033 --> 01:15:06,000
Luckily for us, they won't kill us
like in the Squid Game.

1095
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:07,100
We would've been stuck here then.

1096
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,300
I know.

1097
01:15:16,266 --> 01:15:17,133
Enjoy.

1098
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,333
Did they finish the bulgogi?

1099
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:27,567
Bulgogi? There was none left.

1100
01:15:27,633 --> 01:15:29,333
So they ate it all.

1101
01:15:29,433 --> 01:15:30,500
I'm sure they liked it.

1102
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:31,900
Yes.

1103
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:37,867
- You did all the dishes.
- I did.

1104
01:15:37,967 --> 01:15:39,266
You're good at everything now.

1105
01:15:39,367 --> 01:15:40,667
Of course.

1106
01:15:43,000 --> 01:15:45,100
What happened to your apron?
It looks like you did all the work here.

1107
01:15:47,467 --> 01:15:48,900
Your apron…

1108
01:15:49,066 --> 01:15:51,100
What happened to my apron today?

1109
01:15:51,166 --> 01:15:52,300
You worked hard today.

1110
01:15:52,367 --> 01:15:53,934
- Huh?
- You worked hard today.

1111
01:15:54,533 --> 01:15:55,967
Well, you didn't do anything.

1112
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:05,633
We did all the work.

1113
01:16:05,734 --> 01:16:07,133
Right. What did you do, Yu Mi?

1114
01:16:09,333 --> 01:16:10,700
This is fun.

1115
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:15,467
How pretty.

1116
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:21,600
We need to cut it out
with the pin carefully.

1117
01:16:21,667 --> 01:16:24,667
So where is this cookie from?

1118
01:16:24,734 --> 01:16:25,834
A drama called Squid Game.

1119
01:16:25,900 --> 01:16:27,600
I got an umbrella. What's yours?

1120
01:16:27,667 --> 01:16:28,700
Let's see.

1121
01:16:31,667 --> 01:16:33,400
Look, it's a circle.

1122
01:16:33,467 --> 01:16:34,633
It's pretty.

1123
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:36,000
Should I try mine?

1124
01:16:38,667 --> 01:16:39,934
Oh, no!

1125
01:16:40,934 --> 01:16:42,533
- Did you break it?
- It broke.

1126
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:45,900
Oh, no.

1127
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:54,800
It broke.

1128
01:17:09,567 --> 01:17:10,767
It's really slow today.

1129
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:13,734
What do we do?

1130
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:15,834
Why are people not coming?

1131
01:17:23,834 --> 01:17:26,600
Go to Seo Jin

1132
01:17:26,667 --> 01:17:28,633
- and say we should call it a day.
- Huh?

1133
01:17:29,567 --> 01:17:31,066
Tell him we should call it a day.

1134
01:17:39,633 --> 01:17:40,633
Look at Woo Shik.

1135
01:17:41,633 --> 01:17:42,767
He keeps telling me

1136
01:17:42,867 --> 01:17:45,533
that we should close the restaurant.

1137
01:17:46,767 --> 01:17:48,467
What…

1138
01:17:48,533 --> 01:17:50,100
He must've gone crazy.

1139
01:17:56,000 --> 01:17:56,867
Unbelievable.

1140
01:18:07,433 --> 01:18:09,166
What time are we closing again?

1141
01:18:09,266 --> 01:18:10,800
- Sorry?
- What time are we closing?

1142
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,000
We're closing

1143
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:15,767
when we hit 10,000 pesos.

1144
01:18:15,867 --> 01:18:17,767
- Right?
- Yes.

1145
01:18:18,567 --> 01:18:20,100
How much did we make so far?

1146
01:18:20,767 --> 01:18:21,700
About 3,000.

1147
01:18:24,900 --> 01:18:26,533
- Cheer up, boss.
- What?

1148
01:18:26,600 --> 01:18:28,066
The evening didn't start yet.

1149
01:18:33,900 --> 01:18:35,166
You only need to make 10,000 more.

1150
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:37,800
We must've made 3,000 by now.

1151
01:18:39,734 --> 01:18:41,967
I think we celebrated
our success too early.

1152
01:18:43,533 --> 01:18:45,500
- It's over 10,000.
- We made it.

1153
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,734
- We hit 10,000.
- We hit 10,000.

1154
01:18:49,066 --> 01:18:50,233
- Did we make it?
- What?

1155
01:18:50,333 --> 01:18:51,400
- What? 10,000?
- Yes.

1156
01:18:51,467 --> 01:18:52,767
Of course.

1157
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,900
Tomorrow, we should set a new record.

1158
01:19:04,567 --> 01:19:06,166
Let's do another day.

1159
01:19:06,233 --> 01:19:07,400
Gosh.

1160
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,033
He even did this, which he never does.

1161
01:19:20,633 --> 01:19:24,066
He never does it, but he did it today.

1162
01:19:24,133 --> 01:19:26,700
"Let's go for 12,000." Okay?

1163
01:19:26,767 --> 01:19:29,700
Let's go for 12,000!

1164
01:19:33,867 --> 01:19:35,734
But I think we can hit 10,000.

1165
01:19:36,967 --> 01:19:38,033
I think

1166
01:19:38,100 --> 01:19:39,900
we'll get customers at night.

1167
01:19:39,967 --> 01:19:42,834
After about 6:30… 6 PM.

1168
01:19:49,066 --> 01:19:51,433
No tables. Sorry.

1169
01:19:51,533 --> 01:19:52,633
Oh, no. They're waiting.

1170
01:19:58,166 --> 01:20:00,066
We made 3,000?

1171
01:20:00,834 --> 01:20:04,066
Just wait.
People will start coming after 5:30 PM.

1172
01:20:22,734 --> 01:20:24,000
Customers?

1173
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:25,633
- Are they customers?
- I think so.

1174
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:39,000
Hola.

1175
01:20:39,066 --> 01:20:40,500
- Hola.
- Hola.

1176
01:20:41,467 --> 01:20:43,767
Please order here.

1177
01:20:48,133 --> 01:20:49,233
I'm going with ramyeon.

1178
01:20:50,266 --> 01:20:51,900
I'd like to have cheese ramyeon.

1179
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:53,033
Cheese.

1180
01:20:55,800 --> 01:20:57,967
- Two mineral waters too.
- Two mineral waters?

1181
01:21:00,367 --> 01:21:01,433
We got an order.

1182
01:21:04,834 --> 01:21:06,834
One cheese, right?
One cheese and one regular?

1183
01:21:06,900 --> 01:21:09,266
Yes. One cheese and one regular.

1184
01:21:15,467 --> 01:21:16,500
I'll be on standby.

1185
01:21:21,266 --> 01:21:22,967
If we only sell ramyeon,

1186
01:21:23,033 --> 01:21:25,467
we won't be able to make profit.

1187
01:21:28,700 --> 01:21:30,367
He's so serious about this.

1188
01:21:33,567 --> 01:21:35,667
It's sad that this will be gone tomorrow.

1189
01:21:35,767 --> 01:21:37,867
Come to Korea with me.

1190
01:21:37,934 --> 01:21:39,233
I'm really going to Korea.

1191
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:40,367
Let's go.

1192
01:21:40,433 --> 01:21:42,467
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

1193
01:21:42,533 --> 01:21:43,667
Have a safe trip back home.

1194
01:21:43,734 --> 01:21:44,800
Thank you.

1195
01:21:51,266 --> 01:21:52,200
Bye. Thank you.

1196
01:21:52,266 --> 01:21:53,333
Have a safe trip.

1197
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:54,333
Bye-bye.

1198
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:05,367
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1199
01:22:05,467 --> 01:22:06,433
Bye-bye.

1200
01:22:11,166 --> 01:22:12,066
Flakes?

1201
01:22:16,066 --> 01:22:17,033
All right.

1202
01:22:17,667 --> 01:22:20,200
We have 9,000 more pesos to go.

1203
01:22:23,233 --> 01:22:26,500
Okay, after 30 more ramyeons,
we can go home.

1204
01:22:40,300 --> 01:22:41,300
It looks good.

1205
01:22:45,767 --> 01:22:48,300
It looks good with the cheese.

1206
01:22:58,834 --> 01:22:59,934
It's tasty, isn't it?

1207
01:23:01,533 --> 01:23:02,533
I burned my mouth.

1208
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,767
I love ramyeon. What did you say?

1209
01:23:03,834 --> 01:23:04,934
I burned my mouth.

1210
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,667
Looks like this metal bowl keeps
the food hot.

1211
01:23:30,367 --> 01:23:31,633
It's really good.

1212
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:32,734
Yeah.

1213
01:23:43,133 --> 01:23:44,300
Seriously…

1214
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:47,233
What is the problem here?
Why is this happening?

1215
01:23:50,300 --> 01:23:53,066
I feel like people will come
in the evening.

1216
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:55,567
I bet they'll come after sunset.

1217
01:24:00,834 --> 01:24:02,633
Seriously…

1218
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:24,834
Piña.

1219
01:24:30,467 --> 01:24:31,667
- We're doomed.
- Huh?

1220
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:32,734
We're doomed.

1221
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:34,433
This is like our first day here.

1222
01:24:36,767 --> 01:24:37,767
Well,

1223
01:24:37,834 --> 01:24:39,133
shall we start over?

1224
01:24:39,200 --> 01:24:40,333
Huh?

1225
01:25:11,967 --> 01:25:12,967
Hola.

1226
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,166
Come on in.

1227
01:25:19,800 --> 01:25:20,734
Hola.

1228
01:25:22,200 --> 01:25:23,066
Hola.

1229
01:25:24,834 --> 01:25:25,800
Where should we sit?

1230
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,133
How about over there?

1231
01:25:30,834 --> 01:25:32,433
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1232
01:25:34,567 --> 01:25:36,633
Would you like to take a look
at the menu?

1233
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:38,233
No, you go.

1234
01:25:38,300 --> 01:25:39,767
You want some soup, right?

1235
01:25:54,367 --> 01:25:56,500
Say, "Hi!"

1236
01:26:16,033 --> 01:26:17,500
She's so cute.

1237
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:25,834
It's soup.

1238
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,200
Okay. Then one ramyeon please.

1239
01:26:29,300 --> 01:26:30,567
With cheese or without?

1240
01:26:30,667 --> 01:26:33,834
Without cheese. And…

1241
01:26:33,934 --> 01:26:35,500
I think we got another ramyeon.

1242
01:26:37,233 --> 01:26:39,133
I want a chicken order rush
in the evening.

1243
01:26:41,967 --> 01:26:43,567
The chicken is…

1244
01:26:44,867 --> 01:26:46,533
It looks like camel humps.

1245
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:50,500
We make money when Tae Hyung is busy.

1246
01:26:53,133 --> 01:26:55,433
Please, chicken…

1247
01:26:55,500 --> 01:26:56,734
Chicken…

1248
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:59,600
Chicken, chicken.

1249
01:26:59,700 --> 01:27:03,100
Chicken, chicken.

1250
01:27:03,367 --> 01:27:05,400
So one Coke, one Sprite, and one water.

1251
01:27:12,033 --> 01:27:13,266
It looks so good.

1252
01:27:15,433 --> 01:27:16,633
Thank you.

1253
01:27:17,300 --> 01:27:19,133
What's her name?

1254
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,633
- Elina.
- Elina.

1255
01:27:20,700 --> 01:27:21,867
I see.

1256
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,500
Here's your change
and take this to your table.

1257
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:30,300
- Okay. Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

1258
01:27:30,633 --> 01:27:31,700
The order slip.

1259
01:27:44,734 --> 01:27:46,734
- Chicken.
- Chicken.

1260
01:27:46,800 --> 01:27:48,567
- And hellamyeon.
- Two ramyeon?

1261
01:27:48,633 --> 01:27:49,900
Two ramyeons, one chicken.

1262
01:27:51,233 --> 01:27:53,500
It's the only chicken order we got,
so I'll put extra care.

1263
01:28:08,867 --> 01:28:10,433
That looks like a big portion.

1264
01:28:10,533 --> 01:28:11,600
What?

1265
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:13,266
You want to sell it quickly, right?

1266
01:28:13,367 --> 01:28:15,367
I'm giving them a little extra
for the baby.

1267
01:28:15,467 --> 01:28:18,567
The baby can't eat it. She has no teeth.

1268
01:28:20,033 --> 01:28:23,133
Now I know every customer is precious,

1269
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,633
I want to be generous.

1270
01:28:39,333 --> 01:28:40,333
Look at her.

1271
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:48,767
She's adorable.

1272
01:29:21,967 --> 01:29:23,133
Thank you.

1273
01:29:23,967 --> 01:29:25,400
Will she eat it too?

1274
01:29:25,934 --> 01:29:27,200
No.

1275
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,567
It's too spicy for her.

1276
01:29:31,633 --> 01:29:32,700
Thank you.

1277
01:29:36,066 --> 01:29:37,200
Let me try it.

1278
01:29:43,467 --> 01:29:44,800
- It's good.
- Yeah?

1279
01:29:53,633 --> 01:29:54,700
Dad.

1280
01:30:08,200 --> 01:30:09,633
Look.

1281
01:30:10,567 --> 01:30:12,400
Look at that!

1282
01:30:14,433 --> 01:30:16,600
A duck!

1283
01:30:21,033 --> 01:30:23,000
"Thank you!"

1284
01:30:23,934 --> 01:30:26,433
What a cute duck!

1285
01:30:49,734 --> 01:30:50,700
Spicy?

1286
01:30:50,800 --> 01:30:52,367
It's really good.

1287
01:30:52,467 --> 01:30:54,433
And also really spicy.

1288
01:30:54,533 --> 01:30:55,834
But it's good.

1289
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:15,467
Because I have time.

1290
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:18,967
- Muy bien.
- Muy bien.

1291
01:31:22,066 --> 01:31:24,633
You have nothing to do in the kitchen.

1292
01:31:26,433 --> 01:31:30,166
It looks so
because I just cleaned the place.

1293
01:31:30,266 --> 01:31:31,900
It was messy before.

1294
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:55,567
Gimbap! That's really good.

1295
01:31:56,233 --> 01:31:58,200
- Shall we go in?
- I'm in.

1296
01:31:58,300 --> 01:31:59,767
Is it food?

1297
01:32:05,033 --> 01:32:06,667
I told you we'd get customers.

1298
01:32:07,166 --> 01:32:08,834
Coke, pineapple juice…

1299
01:32:12,100 --> 01:32:13,033
Hello.

1300
01:32:13,266 --> 01:32:16,066
Could you put some tables together?

1301
01:32:16,767 --> 01:32:18,400
Are you five people?

1302
01:32:18,467 --> 01:32:20,066
- No, six.
- Six.

1303
01:32:21,633 --> 01:32:23,867
Okay, can you wait here?

1304
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:32,033
I'm so excited.

1305
01:32:32,133 --> 01:32:33,033
- Me too.
- Me too.

1306
01:32:33,133 --> 01:32:35,266
I feel like my stomach is
roaring more and more.

1307
01:32:35,367 --> 01:32:38,200
I'm over the point where I feel hungry.

1308
01:32:38,633 --> 01:32:41,300
I just know I need food.
I can't feel anything.

1309
01:32:41,400 --> 01:32:43,066
You might get full really quickly then.

1310
01:32:43,166 --> 01:32:44,200
Yeah, I know.

1311
01:32:46,867 --> 01:32:48,900
I guess we should order there.

1312
01:32:48,967 --> 01:32:50,033
It looks like it.

1313
01:32:51,767 --> 01:32:52,834
Hello.

1314
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:53,900
Hola.

1315
01:32:54,266 --> 01:32:57,400
Can I have one ramyeon?

1316
01:32:57,467 --> 01:32:59,166
And one spicy fricken, please.

1317
01:32:59,233 --> 01:33:00,800
Spicy or sweet chili?

1318
01:33:00,867 --> 01:33:01,967
Spicy.

1319
01:33:02,367 --> 01:33:03,767
It's very spicy.

1320
01:33:03,867 --> 01:33:05,266
All right.

1321
01:33:08,934 --> 01:33:10,300
Should we pay now?

1322
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:11,734
Yes, you should pay now.

1323
01:33:12,166 --> 01:33:13,367
Are you paying all together?

1324
01:33:13,467 --> 01:33:15,100
Uh… no.

1325
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:17,400
Separately?

1326
01:33:17,467 --> 01:33:19,333
Yes, we're splitting the bill.

1327
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:22,033
Okay, then…

1328
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:24,600
Okay, your order was...

1329
01:33:24,667 --> 01:33:26,767
I'll order one ramyeon and one water.

1330
01:33:26,834 --> 01:33:29,633
What about the chicken?
Together or separately?

1331
01:33:29,700 --> 01:33:32,100
- Do you have cash?
- No.

1332
01:33:32,700 --> 01:33:33,600
Okay.

1333
01:33:33,667 --> 01:33:35,667
All right.

1334
01:33:35,734 --> 01:33:37,533
So which of you are together and…

1335
01:33:37,633 --> 01:33:38,700
The three of us are together.

1336
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:40,233
The three of you...

1337
01:33:40,600 --> 01:33:44,834
Cancel the chicken order here.
I'll pay mine.

1338
01:33:44,934 --> 01:33:47,333
So you're only ordering ramyeon and water.

1339
01:33:47,433 --> 01:33:48,300
Yes.

1340
01:33:53,367 --> 01:33:55,867
One hellaspicy fricken.

1341
01:33:55,934 --> 01:33:57,433
I'm gonna get

1342
01:33:57,500 --> 01:33:58,633
the fried tofu gimbap

1343
01:33:58,700 --> 01:34:00,633
and ramyeon.

1344
01:34:00,700 --> 01:34:01,967
And ramyeon?

1345
01:34:02,533 --> 01:34:04,000
- Chibap?
- Chibap?

1346
01:34:04,066 --> 01:34:05,367
And…

1347
01:34:05,433 --> 01:34:06,500
a pineapple juice please.

1348
01:34:06,567 --> 01:34:07,633
I want a Coke.

1349
01:34:07,700 --> 01:34:09,200
A water for me.

1350
01:34:09,266 --> 01:34:10,767
Chibap, pineapple juice…

1351
01:34:16,467 --> 01:34:17,500
Are you ready?

1352
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,567
I don't want to pronounce it wrong,

1353
01:34:19,667 --> 01:34:20,867
but bulgogi…

1354
01:34:20,967 --> 01:34:22,300
- Rice?
- Rice.

1355
01:34:22,400 --> 01:34:23,266
Anything to drink?

1356
01:34:23,367 --> 01:34:24,734
One pineapple juice.

1357
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,233
Please.

1358
01:34:27,500 --> 01:34:29,533
Can I get the...

1359
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:30,700
Hellaspicy fricken?

1360
01:34:30,767 --> 01:34:32,166
Okay.

1361
01:34:34,767 --> 01:34:37,200
All for the black table.

1362
01:34:38,166 --> 01:34:39,734
Black… They're all for the black table.

1363
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:46,233
An order.

1364
01:34:52,166 --> 01:34:53,133
You gotta focus.

1365
01:34:56,834 --> 01:34:57,867
Wait, this is bad.

1366
01:34:57,934 --> 01:34:59,500
Hold on.

1367
01:35:02,600 --> 01:35:04,967
Woo Shik, did you relay the ramyeon order
to the kitchen?

1368
01:35:09,166 --> 01:35:11,633
Woo Shik, did you relay this order too?

1369
01:35:16,166 --> 01:35:18,767
There's no table. They have to wait.

1370
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:23,967
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

1371
01:35:25,100 --> 01:35:26,533
Today's our last day, so…

1372
01:35:30,467 --> 01:35:33,600
If we don't sell the rice menus,
we can't make profit.

1373
01:35:33,667 --> 01:35:34,834
I…

1374
01:35:36,233 --> 01:35:38,500
I'm gonna be the master of gimbap.

1375
01:35:38,934 --> 01:35:40,367
Good luck.

1376
01:35:40,934 --> 01:35:42,000
Too rough.

1377
01:35:43,800 --> 01:35:44,900
Gentle.

1378
01:35:48,133 --> 01:35:50,000
Chef, you can count on me.

1379
01:35:51,633 --> 01:35:52,467
An order.

1380
01:35:54,633 --> 01:35:55,900
An order.

1381
01:35:56,000 --> 01:35:58,133
I need to roll four more.

1382
01:35:58,667 --> 01:35:59,633
Do we have enough glasses?

1383
01:35:59,734 --> 01:36:01,333
No, we're running out of them.

1384
01:36:01,433 --> 01:36:02,567
- No more glasses?
- No.

1385
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:06,867
New order.

1386
01:36:08,233 --> 01:36:09,834
- Marinade more meat.
- Okay.

1387
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:12,367
I'll do my best to roll the gimbap.

1388
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,767
If we hit 12,000, we're safe.

1389
01:36:15,834 --> 01:36:18,633
The queue is incredibly long.

1390
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:19,834
How many groups are waiting?

1391
01:36:21,300 --> 01:36:22,433
Three groups.

1392
01:36:22,500 --> 01:36:24,533
I think we'll hit 10,000.

1393
01:36:24,633 --> 01:36:26,900
I don't think we made 10,000 today.

1394
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:28,734
We didn't sell lots of chicken.

1395
01:36:28,834 --> 01:36:30,200
We sold lots of ramyeon.

1396
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:32,000
I'm running out of ingredients soon.

1397
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,767
- What a drama.
- What a drama, indeed.

1398
01:36:34,867 --> 01:36:36,433
What a drama.

1399
01:36:36,533 --> 01:36:38,166
This is our last customer.

1400
01:36:38,867 --> 01:36:40,266
Let's go.

1401
01:36:40,333 --> 01:36:41,600
Here comes the big one.

1402
01:36:41,667 --> 01:36:45,767
Our teamwork is perfect now.

1403
01:36:45,834 --> 01:36:47,200
But we're going home.

1404
01:36:48,834 --> 01:36:49,734
- It's okay.
- Let me.

1405
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:50,900
- Yu Mi.
- Give it to me.

1406
01:36:50,967 --> 01:36:51,834
Give the corn dog to Yu Mi.

1407
01:36:51,934 --> 01:36:53,567
- Let go.
- Let go.

1408
01:37:36,266 --> 01:37:38,900
