00:00:22,533 --> 00:00:26,000
JINNY'S KITCHEN

2
00:00:26,133 --> 00:00:29,967
This is bad.
Our boss is gonna look gloomy again.

3
00:00:30,033 --> 00:00:31,633
Sir, we're open now, right?

4
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,900
I hear there's nobody out there.

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,166
What do we do?

6
00:00:35,567 --> 00:00:36,633
Hola.

7
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:39,166
We got one more group.

8
00:00:39,266 --> 00:00:40,500
What's going on?

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,333
Seo Jin's smile got 50 percent wider.

10
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:46,367
How many?

11
00:00:46,467 --> 00:00:47,367
Six.

12
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:49,934
Finally, it's happening.

13
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:54,633
Is it okay
if I put the chair here and sit?

14
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,500
We're out of chairs.

15
00:00:56,567 --> 00:00:58,900
Gosh, we're busier than the weekend.

16
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:19,433
Thanks.

17
00:01:19,533 --> 00:01:20,567
You have a chair now.

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,367
Oh.

19
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,166
We're out of chairs.

20
00:01:25,233 --> 00:01:26,600
What did you order?

21
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:29,633
-What you ate.
-It's really good. I'm serious.

22
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,433
Perfect to eat before drinking.

23
00:01:31,467 --> 00:01:32,667
What did you order?

24
00:01:32,734 --> 00:01:33,967
It looks interesting.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,433
It's Korean street food.

26
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,567
Woo Shik, what's going on now?

27
00:01:38,633 --> 00:01:40,133
-Huh?
-So…

28
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:42,567
This one's served. The mineral water.

29
00:01:42,867 --> 00:01:44,433
And here. The Coke is served?

30
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:45,433
Coke… Yes, it is.

31
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:47,100
-Yeah? Are you sure?
-Yes.

32
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,200
Good.

33
00:01:48,433 --> 00:01:50,633
-Then ramyeon…
-Not this. Whose is this?

34
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:54,233
I think it's him.

35
00:01:55,834 --> 00:01:58,433
He looks like that guy.

36
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,633
-He might be him.
-I'm 100,000 percent sure.

37
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:05,500
He's the man on Parasite.

38
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:08,700
-Why don't we just ask him?
-Let's do that.

39
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:14,100
Corn dogs?

40
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,834
-I'm so excited.
-Here you go.

41
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:17,300
Thank you.

42
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,667
Let's ask him.

43
00:02:18,767 --> 00:02:20,200
-Can I ask you something?
-Yes.

44
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,533
Were you in a movie?

45
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:23,567
-Yes.
-Which one?

46
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:24,700
Parasite.

47
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:39,133
I think it's really good.

48
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
Yeah?

49
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:43,500
-It has sugar on the outside.
-It's very sweet.

50
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,367
Can I try it?

51
00:02:47,867 --> 00:02:49,133
It's tasty.

52
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,400
It's really good.

53
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,133
We have three chibaps left?

54
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,000
Yes.

55
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,400
I can make three at once.

56
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,934
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

57
00:03:33,133 --> 00:03:35,033
Oh, kimchi. This is awesome.

58
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:36,800
-Yeah?
-Kimchi.

59
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:38,533
Kimchi is good.

60
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,333
I think it's really good.

61
00:03:48,834 --> 00:03:51,300
-It's so good.
-Yeah.

62
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,000
Korean food is really good.

63
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,100
Sorry?

64
00:03:56,734 --> 00:03:59,300
Korean food is good.

65
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,867
-For you.
-Thank you.

66
00:04:05,734 --> 00:04:07,533
It's also good.

67
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,967
It's also really good.

68
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:19,867
It's good, right?

69
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,633
I've never been to a Korean restaurant.

70
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,100
But I think

71
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:28,900
I'll crave Korean food more often.

72
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,233
One Coke…

73
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:48,266
Hi.

74
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,900
-Can I get a Coke?
-One more Coke?

75
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,834
What?

76
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,367
One extra Coke order.

77
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:01,467
One mineral water.

78
00:05:15,266 --> 00:05:17,467
It's like he's always ready.

79
00:05:17,533 --> 00:05:19,433
I didn't know we were coming here.

80
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,233
You always dress like that.

81
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,867
I should've worn long sleeves.

82
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:28,166
Long sleeves?

83
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:29,600
You look nice today.

84
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:31,900
She's dressed super nicely today.

85
00:05:31,967 --> 00:05:33,467
-Me?
-Yes.

86
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,500
Right? She totally is.

87
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,266
This is how I normally dress.

88
00:05:38,734 --> 00:05:41,233
I'm just wearing a different necklace.

89
00:06:37,834 --> 00:06:39,200
-Keep it up, Yu Mi.
-Thanks.

90
00:06:56,133 --> 00:06:58,133
It looks awesome! I wanna order more.

91
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:02,567
So pretty. I'm gonna take photos
of every single detail.

92
00:07:02,633 --> 00:07:05,266
Make sure this is in the photo too.

93
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:07,467
Send them to me later.

94
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:12,800
Let's take a selfie together.

95
00:07:12,867 --> 00:07:15,033
Sure. Let's do that.

96
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,000
Hello again, guys.

97
00:07:45,066 --> 00:07:46,467
-Hello.
-Oh, hi!

98
00:07:53,133 --> 00:07:54,166
We're four people.

99
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:55,867
-Do you have a table?
-No.

100
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,667
I think you'll have to wait
for more than one hour.

101
00:07:58,767 --> 00:07:59,834
One hour?

102
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,367
There are already two people waiting.

103
00:08:08,533 --> 00:08:12,266
The boss' dimples are getting
deeper and deeper.

104
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:17,500
One regular corn dog
and one regular tater dog.

105
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:20,667
And we got one regular tteokbokki too.

106
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:26,133
Okay, an original tteokbokki…

107
00:08:31,033 --> 00:08:33,266
-The original one.
-Yes, one tater dog.

108
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:36,800
One tater dog.

109
00:08:41,066 --> 00:08:44,200
-And one corn dog.
-Yes, one corn dog.

110
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,033
Check.

111
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,533
Check, check.

112
00:09:13,867 --> 00:09:16,333
Gosh, we're busier than the weekend.

113
00:09:55,533 --> 00:09:57,500
For the table that ordered tteokbokki.

114
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:05,467
Corn dog?

115
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:10,233
And the tater dog is his.

116
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,467
The tater dog looks amazing.

117
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:15,800
It looks really good.

118
00:10:22,367 --> 00:10:24,934
You can cut it with these.

119
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:30,033
Oh, that's brilliant!

120
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,200
We hold it with these and then cut it.

121
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:34,700
Scissors for food? Can you believe it?

122
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,400
My tater dog is like a cookie.

123
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,000
Is it a bit sweet?

124
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:58,300
Yes, it's sweet.

125
00:11:02,834 --> 00:11:04,600
It's so good. I love the food.

126
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,667
I think I'll eat well in Korea.

127
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:08,567
I should come back here tomorrow.

128
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:12,433
Fantastic.

129
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Bye, thank you.

130
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:21,033
So...

131
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:23,333
-Be careful with the wine glasses.
-Okay.

132
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:28,033
I'll take it.

133
00:11:28,033 --> 00:11:29,100
Thanks. Be careful.

134
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:30,734
Okay. Should I put them here?

135
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
Yes.

136
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:50,433
Do you guys have some white wine?

137
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,333
Yes.

138
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,367
-You wanna drink it while waiting?
-Yes.

139
00:11:58,633 --> 00:12:00,533
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

140
00:12:01,266 --> 00:12:03,967
-I'll get you more if you need more.
-Thank you.

141
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:05,834
-Hi.
-Can I order?

142
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:07,600
-Yes.
-So one of this.

143
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:11,834
-Can I order this too?
-This...

144
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:14,834
Yes, and one of this too.

145
00:12:16,233 --> 00:12:18,000
Hello. You came back.

146
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,767
Yes. For sure.

147
00:12:21,834 --> 00:12:22,734
Combo.

148
00:12:24,533 --> 00:12:26,633
-Thanks so much.
-Take this.

149
00:12:28,633 --> 00:12:29,667
They recognized us.

150
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:31,333
He said, "You came back!"

151
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:33,500
You're wearing the same clothes...

152
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,333
Let's try more Korean food back in Paris.

153
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,700
But it won't be the same.

154
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,367
It won't be like here.

155
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,834
How about this?

156
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:48,633
How many pieces do we get?

157
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:51,734
Here's the sample. You'll get ten pieces.

158
00:12:51,834 --> 00:12:54,100
Ten pieces? Should we take that?

159
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,533
Let's get two gimbaps and one chicken.

160
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:59,900
-Can I get the beef one?
-One bulgogi gimbap?

161
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:01,000
And the vegetarian one.

162
00:13:01,367 --> 00:13:02,867
One spicy fricken, please.

163
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:04,934
For drinks? Oh, the wine.

164
00:13:04,967 --> 00:13:06,567
We've got the wine. Thank you.

165
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:09,934
-Take this to your table.
-Thank you.

166
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:13,100
We got an order.

167
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,166
Okay.

168
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,400
An order.

169
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:19,500
-Wow.
-More orders.

170
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,066
Two chickens.

171
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,500
Fried tofu, bulgogi.

172
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,133
The tofu and bulgogi for purple.

173
00:14:04,734 --> 00:14:06,834
-Here you go.
-Oh, thank you.

174
00:14:10,467 --> 00:14:11,900
Do you want some more wine?

175
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,166
Sure.

176
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,367
That's very nice of you.

177
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,500
I'll give you more wine.

178
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:24,600
Today, I brought my wife.

179
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:25,834
You met my son, right?

180
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,900
Yeah, I met him yesterday.

181
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:57,900
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

182
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:01,600
-Can I take a photo?
-Sure.

183
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,000
Smile.

184
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:06,934
Oh, it looks delicious.

185
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:09,200
Yeah, this looks lovely.

186
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,467
Let's try it.

187
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:12,467
Do you have it with the pickle?

188
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:21,800
It's seaweed.

189
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,400
This looks amazing.

190
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:27,600
-Tofu?
-Thank you.

191
00:15:30,467 --> 00:15:33,500
Here are the chopsticks,
in case you need them.

192
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,133
Oh, cute. Look.

193
00:15:36,266 --> 00:15:38,333
-It's got a little sticker.
-Oh, cool.

194
00:15:38,867 --> 00:15:41,133
I like that... They're done beautifully.

195
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:42,467
This one's very lovely.

196
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,000
Floral arrangements.

197
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:51,533
It's quite spicy.

198
00:16:03,266 --> 00:16:04,467
The tofu is good.

199
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,467
-What's the beef one like?
-Try it.

200
00:16:14,734 --> 00:16:16,266
Happy with your decision?

201
00:16:16,367 --> 00:16:17,400
Mm-hmm.

202
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:20,333
I love it.

203
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,033
It's so good.

204
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:30,500
It's really good.

205
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:37,500
It'd be good with rice too.

206
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:09,467
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

207
00:17:13,667 --> 00:17:15,233
Oh, no. There's no sauce.

208
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:32,567
-Is it this one?
-Yes, it is. Thank you.

209
00:17:32,667 --> 00:17:34,734
Or do you want a spicier one?

210
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,166
It's okay. This is perfect.

211
00:17:42,567 --> 00:17:44,133
You really like it, don't you?

212
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:46,633
I wanna try it with chopsticks.

213
00:17:48,033 --> 00:17:49,467
How do you use them?

214
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:52,934
This is how I do it.

215
00:17:53,533 --> 00:17:56,767
Two fingers under one chopstick
and the other between those two.

216
00:17:56,867 --> 00:18:01,000
Then cross them.
I only move the upper one.

217
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:02,734
I can't pick up the noodles.

218
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,867
Yes, you can.

219
00:18:08,033 --> 00:18:11,333
-No way. I can't do that.
-It's not easy.

220
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,100
Woo Shik, how are things going?

221
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,433
-Sorry?
-So…

222
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:25,867
Which one's skyblue?

223
00:18:25,967 --> 00:18:28,033
-Sky--
-It's right in front of us.

224
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,834
Right?

225
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,166
Here's the Coke.

226
00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:38,266
-Am I wrong?
-Coke?

227
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:50,367
-Are you happy?
-What?

228
00:18:50,433 --> 00:18:51,934
Are you happy?

229
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,033
Happy for what?

230
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,567
Chicken for gray, check.

231
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:58,166
His smile must be 80 percent wider by now.

232
00:18:58,433 --> 00:18:59,734
He's so different.

233
00:18:59,834 --> 00:19:01,467
-Who?
-The boss.

234
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:03,633
He seems really happy.

235
00:19:03,734 --> 00:19:05,367
He's so different.

236
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:10,500
It's like watching
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

237
00:19:17,066 --> 00:19:19,834
How many ingredients do we have left?

238
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,000
-Ingredients?
-Enough?

239
00:19:21,066 --> 00:19:22,500
Well, we have some more.

240
00:19:22,533 --> 00:19:23,433
-We have more?
-Yes.

241
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:25,633
-I'll take more customers.
-But the chicken…

242
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:28,600
This is it?

243
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,500
-That's it.
-Fry some more then.

244
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,633
We fried them all.

245
00:19:32,734 --> 00:19:34,000
-So no more chicken?
-No.

246
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:36,600
Then we can't let more customers in.

247
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:40,500
Sir, but we did the best we could.

248
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,834
Is there more chicken?

249
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,900
Chicken? No…

250
00:19:43,934 --> 00:19:45,400
Oh, wait. We do.

251
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,834
Tae Hyung. Here.

252
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:53,233
We have enough chicken for four servings.

253
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,734
-Four servings of chicken?
-Yes.

254
00:19:54,734 --> 00:19:55,767
Should I fry them?

255
00:19:55,834 --> 00:19:57,033
Yes, we should fry them.

256
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:16,033
Look at the moon.

257
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,533
Look at the moon. So pretty.

258
00:20:17,934 --> 00:20:19,633
It's so beautiful.

259
00:20:19,867 --> 00:20:21,367
Wow. What a beautiful moon.

260
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,533
Oh, it's cool.

261
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,367
-Are you done with your orders?
-Yes.

262
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:38,867
That was crazy.

263
00:20:38,934 --> 00:20:41,567
I think we should watch what we say.

264
00:20:41,633 --> 00:20:43,734
I said I wanted a customer rush and…

265
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,233
-I told you we'd be busy today.
-And it's like

266
00:20:46,266 --> 00:20:47,867
we had a storm of customers.

267
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:50,333
Woo Shik.

268
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:53,367
No que, right? Let's close the entrance.

269
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,300
We'll wait together.

270
00:21:13,367 --> 00:21:15,300
-Oh, really?
-They're with us.

271
00:21:21,266 --> 00:21:22,967
Where should they sit though?

272
00:21:27,033 --> 00:21:30,200
It's getting crowded here.
Let's leave so people can sit.

273
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,967
Sure. Right.

274
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:36,166
Thank you.

275
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:37,533
It was excellent.

276
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:51,367
Okay.

277
00:21:54,033 --> 00:21:56,133
They have combo menus too.

278
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,433
We can try everything.

279
00:21:57,500 --> 00:22:00,166
Yeah, a little bit of everything.

280
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:03,233
I'd like to get Jinny's Combo A.

281
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:04,533
Jinny's Combo A.

282
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,166
-Jinny's Combo B.
-Jinny's Combo B.

283
00:22:08,266 --> 00:22:10,500
I'll have one Jinny's Combo A

284
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,533
and one Jinny's Combo B.

285
00:22:12,867 --> 00:22:14,500
-A Jinny's Combo B?
-Yes.

286
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:16,233
Could we get a tuna gimbap

287
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,333
and something else for the other combo?

288
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,400
Sure.

289
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,667
Any recommendations?

290
00:22:20,734 --> 00:22:22,100
-This one.
-Okay.

291
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:24,934
Thank you.

292
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,033
Did you guys change the menu?

293
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,834
We added some new menus.

294
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,433
Oh, You added them.

295
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,800
Chibap is the new one.

296
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:33,934
Kibap? Chibap?

297
00:22:34,033 --> 00:22:35,567
Chibap? Would you like one?

298
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:41,333
We got an order.

299
00:22:42,567 --> 00:22:45,734
I'll put the tuna gimbap
on the tray first.

300
00:23:11,033 --> 00:23:13,867
After this, I'm going back to Korea.

301
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:28,767
I was looking for that too.

302
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,900
Seo Jun.

303
00:23:35,033 --> 00:23:36,300
What can I do?

304
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:37,400
Pour it.

305
00:23:40,266 --> 00:23:41,633
What do you think?

306
00:23:41,734 --> 00:23:42,734
-Not bad.
-Not bad?

307
00:23:42,834 --> 00:23:43,834
No.

308
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:16,800
Jinny's Combo B.

309
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,700
B.

310
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:21,867
If the menu changes,
I'll come every day.

311
00:24:22,667 --> 00:24:24,266
They're changing the menu? How?

312
00:24:24,367 --> 00:24:25,433
They added new menus.

313
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,266
Jinny's Combo B?

314
00:24:30,333 --> 00:24:33,066
That's for him and me.

315
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,200
Wow.

316
00:24:37,266 --> 00:24:38,567
My mouth is watering.

317
00:24:39,934 --> 00:24:43,133
Jonas liked the dumplings.

318
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,166
-Is this mandu?
-Yes.

319
00:24:51,367 --> 00:24:52,433
Combo A?

320
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:55,300
Your gimbap is coming too.

321
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,800
Okay. Thank you.

322
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,066
Looks delicious.

323
00:24:58,133 --> 00:24:59,266
Yeah.

324
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,800
We'll give it to you. Easy.

325
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,367
People will think we've been starving you.

326
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,066
Enjoy, everyone.

327
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,934
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

328
00:25:13,033 --> 00:25:14,300
Mom!

329
00:25:14,367 --> 00:25:17,367
Okay. Just one second. It's too hot now.

330
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:26,533
It's so good. How's yours?

331
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:28,400
I don't know how to eat this.

332
00:25:29,867 --> 00:25:31,266
How do you cut it?

333
00:25:31,266 --> 00:25:33,567
-Hold it with the tongs.
-With the tongs.

334
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:35,200
And pick it up.

335
00:25:35,266 --> 00:25:36,700
Yes. Vertically.

336
00:25:55,967 --> 00:26:00,700
I was so disappointed
when I heard they're only temporary.

337
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,433
I know.

338
00:26:02,533 --> 00:26:05,266
Mom!

339
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,033
Mom!

340
00:26:28,533 --> 00:26:30,333
You like it, huh?

341
00:26:30,433 --> 00:26:32,233
Look at him eating the noodles.

342
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,500
-Does he like it?
-He loves it.

343
00:26:35,266 --> 00:26:39,800
The viewers must think
Mexican babies are good with spicy food.

344
00:26:39,867 --> 00:26:41,500
My son can even eat habaneros.

345
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,333
Should we switch?

346
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,467
Sure.

347
00:27:02,867 --> 00:27:04,533
It's quite extraordinary.

348
00:27:05,333 --> 00:27:07,266
Very unique.

349
00:27:07,367 --> 00:27:10,433
I guess I'm not used to it
because I haven't tried it.

350
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:12,467
-It's not bad.
-Is it the consistency?

351
00:27:12,533 --> 00:27:15,266
Yeah, it's just new.

352
00:27:16,066 --> 00:27:19,567
It's like a sausage made with rice.

353
00:27:19,633 --> 00:27:21,867
It's rice but compressed.

354
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,233
Thank you.

355
00:27:33,367 --> 00:27:34,433
Excuse me.

356
00:27:34,533 --> 00:27:35,700
What is this?

357
00:27:36,533 --> 00:27:37,734
It's kimchi.

358
00:27:37,834 --> 00:27:39,667
Do you know kimchi?

359
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:41,300
Oh, okay.

360
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:01,200
-It's crazy.
-Yeah?

361
00:28:01,266 --> 00:28:04,367
I think this is my favorite.

362
00:28:04,433 --> 00:28:10,333
It was stupid of us to order
four, five of the same dishes.

363
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:14,533
With kimchi, rice, and eggs…
You should order this one too.

364
00:28:14,633 --> 00:28:17,300
We should come back tomorrow.

365
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:21,333
Oh, it's closed.

366
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,367
No.

367
00:28:23,433 --> 00:28:26,066
I was so excited to try their food.

368
00:28:26,133 --> 00:28:28,233
It's really cheap too.

369
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,200
Is it still possible to eat here?

370
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,867
-No, we're closed.
-Closed? Really?

371
00:28:41,266 --> 00:28:44,600
We're leaving tonight.

372
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,233
We have no more food.

373
00:28:47,066 --> 00:28:48,266
No food. Okay.

374
00:28:59,233 --> 00:29:00,800
Let's say we get popular

375
00:29:00,834 --> 00:29:03,033
and get lots of customers waiting in line.

376
00:29:03,033 --> 00:29:04,900
But we're supposed to close at 5 PM.

377
00:29:04,967 --> 00:29:07,934
Will you still close the restaurant
or keep it open?

378
00:29:08,567 --> 00:29:10,233
Open until we're out of food.

379
00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:13,867
As long as we have the ingredients.

380
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:22,800
-We're done, right?
-Sorry?

381
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,967
Do we have more left?

382
00:29:24,066 --> 00:29:25,567
We have more ingredients.

383
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,900
-We do?
-We have more over there.

384
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,200
-One chibap, one chicken…
-Some tteokbokki too.

385
00:29:33,266 --> 00:29:34,934
We have some tteokbokki left.

386
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,133
Well, we got more customers and…

387
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
Let's do one more.

388
00:29:40,233 --> 00:29:41,500
It's a group of six.

389
00:29:41,567 --> 00:29:42,834
That's doable.

390
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,433
Yeah, let's go for it.

391
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,000
Excuse me!

392
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,300
Hey!

393
00:30:00,667 --> 00:30:02,066
Hello?

394
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,667
How many are you again?

395
00:30:18,767 --> 00:30:19,800
-Five.
-Five?

396
00:30:21,066 --> 00:30:24,200
Some menus may not be available
at the moment. Is that okay?

397
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,600
-It's okay.
-Okay, good.

398
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,333
We'll make a table for you.

399
00:30:29,433 --> 00:30:30,667
Okay, cool.

400
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:32,400
So six people?

401
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:34,300
-No, five.
-What?

402
00:30:38,867 --> 00:30:40,300
Put the tables together.

403
00:30:40,333 --> 00:30:41,567
What?

404
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:42,900
For five.

405
00:30:43,066 --> 00:30:44,233
Hold on, wait.

406
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,367
Here you go.

407
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,834
-Hey!
-Hey!

408
00:30:54,934 --> 00:30:56,767
We met the other day, right?

409
00:30:56,867 --> 00:30:58,967
You kept your promise!

410
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,100
-Okay.
-Five?

411
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,867
-Yes.
-You can order here.

412
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:09,166
Did you meet them earlier?

413
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:16,533
We opened a restaurant.

414
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,934
Yes, it's right there. We're actually...

415
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:29,066
-We've got ramyeon, corn dogs…
-Wow.

416
00:31:29,166 --> 00:31:30,100
That's cool.

417
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,700
Are you guys familiar with Korean movies?

418
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,934
-No.
-Not really.

419
00:31:35,033 --> 00:31:36,433
Only Parasite.

420
00:31:36,533 --> 00:31:37,633
I was on Parasite.

421
00:31:37,734 --> 00:31:38,867
You were on Parasite?

422
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,633
-I played the son.
-Really?

423
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,934
-That was you?
-Yeah.

424
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,000
We'll be there tomorrow.

425
00:31:45,066 --> 00:31:47,467
-Can we get a photo with you?
-Tomorrow.

426
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:50,567
Tomorrow we'll get your autograph.

427
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:53,000
Are you okay with spicy?

428
00:31:53,066 --> 00:31:54,400
-Yes.
-Yes.

429
00:31:54,467 --> 00:31:55,800
Then you should try this.

430
00:31:55,867 --> 00:31:57,300
-Is it good?
-Yes.

431
00:31:58,066 --> 00:31:59,500
One of this and…

432
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:02,600
I wanna try this one too.

433
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,200
Me too.

434
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,300
-So two of it?
-Make that three.

435
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,834
Three?

436
00:32:07,934 --> 00:32:09,000
-Four.
-Four?

437
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,633
Four? Okay.

438
00:32:10,734 --> 00:32:12,667
It's really spicy. I'm warning you.

439
00:32:12,734 --> 00:32:14,300
-Wait.
-Very spicy?

440
00:32:14,367 --> 00:32:15,834
Very, very spicy.

441
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:16,934
Is this one good?

442
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,033
Yes.

443
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,467
I'll take that one.

444
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:22,233
-That should be okay.
-That's all?

445
00:32:22,934 --> 00:32:25,367
-Finished?
-How many pieces of chicken do we get?

446
00:32:26,233 --> 00:32:27,300
About 12?

447
00:32:27,367 --> 00:32:28,967
Okay. That's perfect.

448
00:32:29,033 --> 00:32:32,800
You're our last customers, so we'll
give you all the chicken we have left.

449
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,934
-Thank you.
-Do you want drinks?

450
00:32:35,967 --> 00:32:36,834
We got an order.

451
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,567
You'll see my veins popping out
my forehead

452
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,500
because of the spicy food.

453
00:32:43,533 --> 00:32:45,867
I just started eating spicy food recently.

454
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,567
I didn't grow up with spicy food.

455
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:51,600
I'm really good with spicy food.

456
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:58,400
You're gonna be famous in Korea.

457
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:01,934
-It's the last round. Let's go.
-Let's do it.

458
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:08,967
Two hellamyeons, two ramyeons,

459
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:11,867
one corn dog, one hella…

460
00:33:11,967 --> 00:33:15,233
Seo Jun, we got two ramyeons
and three hellamyeons.

461
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:16,633
Wait. That's a lot.

462
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,033
One chicken, two hellamyeons,
two ramyeons…

463
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,166
-We got three hellamyeons.
-Yes.

464
00:33:23,333 --> 00:33:25,533
Tae Hyung, let's serve the chicken first.

465
00:33:25,967 --> 00:33:27,400
-Okay?
-Okay.

466
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:54,667
I'll show them K-Chicken.

467
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,600
I'll show them the best chicken dish.

468
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:11,300
Are you sure you can eat spicy food?

469
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:13,233
Bro, you only live once.

470
00:34:17,767 --> 00:34:19,700
-Wow.
-It looks so good.

471
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,200
It looks amazing and sweet. I'm excited.

472
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,467
These are pickles.

473
00:34:23,567 --> 00:34:25,533
-Pickles, wow.
-Thank you.

474
00:34:26,633 --> 00:34:28,734
Guys, enjoy.

475
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,567
Ooh, it looks crazy.

476
00:34:37,967 --> 00:34:39,000
Wow.

477
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,934
It's delicious.

478
00:34:45,033 --> 00:34:46,567
It's so crispy.

479
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:49,433
Wow.

480
00:34:49,533 --> 00:34:51,233
-It's so good.
-It's really good.

481
00:34:52,567 --> 00:34:55,033
Are we all eating our second pieces?

482
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:57,133
Yes, we're eating our second pieces.

483
00:34:57,133 --> 00:34:58,834
Rock-paper-scissors?

484
00:34:58,834 --> 00:34:59,867
Okay.

485
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,467
Should we share this?

486
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:05,000
Yeah, let's split it into half first.

487
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:12,934
It's so good.

488
00:35:14,166 --> 00:35:15,500
Three hellamyeons.

489
00:35:17,166 --> 00:35:18,266
Two ramyeons.

490
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,333
All right. Let's go step by step.

491
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:44,533
So about tomorrow…

492
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,467
Do you have a lot to prep?

493
00:35:46,967 --> 00:35:48,533
We're still cooking for today.

494
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,000
Oh, is that so?

495
00:35:50,667 --> 00:35:52,433
Then we should come early tomorrow?

496
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,700
And you're saying that with a smile.

497
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,734
What?

498
00:35:57,834 --> 00:35:59,834
I feel like I'll see you in my dreams.

499
00:35:59,934 --> 00:36:02,333
I mean, after resting well today.

500
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:04,767
Rest well and start early tomorrow.

501
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:33,700
Let's do it.

502
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,000
So that's how it's done.

503
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,333
Let's go.

504
00:36:58,033 --> 00:36:59,233
Are you sharing it?

505
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:00,467
No.

506
00:37:01,767 --> 00:37:03,100
Picante, picante.

507
00:37:03,734 --> 00:37:05,633
-It's really good.
-Thank you, man.

508
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,100
Now, time to cry, cough, and sweat.

509
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:14,066
See you in hell.

510
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,033
I'm so excited.

511
00:37:25,533 --> 00:37:27,333
It's not bad.

512
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,266
Is it tasty?

513
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:40,567
It's not very… Wow.

514
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:42,867
-Is it hitting you now?
-No, it's just warm.

515
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:50,900
It doesn't hit you instantly,

516
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:55,166
but it does make my body feel warm.

517
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,400
That's why you should
just eat it up quickly.

518
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,734
I feel like I'm not eating
so elegantly right now.

519
00:38:06,834 --> 00:38:10,300
I think you're gonna be famous.

520
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,400
I can feel the veins
popping out of my forehead.

521
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,033
I can see them. Can you see them too?

522
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:18,433
Yeah, I can.

523
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,700
And lots of open pores too.

524
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,867
Bro, did you go out?

525
00:38:23,934 --> 00:38:25,834
Did you take a shower?

526
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,033
He did some running.

527
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,700
I swam in the lake real quick.

528
00:38:33,033 --> 00:38:36,266
You can just cry if you want.
You're smiling.

529
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:38,900
He just wants to take a break.

530
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,533
It's not that bad.

531
00:38:40,633 --> 00:38:42,100
Not to me.

532
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,033
But I'm not sure about my poop tomorrow.

533
00:38:45,133 --> 00:38:46,500
My lips are burning.

534
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,367
Aren't they red right now?

535
00:38:52,834 --> 00:38:54,900
Maybe this is a TV prank.

536
00:38:54,967 --> 00:38:56,266
What if suddenly we hear,

537
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:58,834
"Green light. Red light?"

538
00:39:06,133 --> 00:39:08,233
That was a heck of a second half.

539
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,467
I told you.

540
00:39:10,533 --> 00:39:13,400
Seo Jin, you're smiling
from ear to ear right now.

541
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:14,400
Your dimples…

542
00:39:14,467 --> 00:39:16,667
Come on. This is the least we should make.

543
00:39:16,767 --> 00:39:18,166
I mean, all of a sudden…

544
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:22,166
They started rushing in.

545
00:39:22,266 --> 00:39:24,500
Wow, we made more than 10,000 pesos.

546
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,567
-It's over 10,000.
-We reached our goal.

547
00:39:26,633 --> 00:39:28,667
We made over 10,000 pesos.

548
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,667
We almost couldn't…

549
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:33,300
-That team?
-if I hadn't let our last customers in.

550
00:39:41,567 --> 00:39:44,066
-We barely made it.
-See? That's why I had them.

551
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:45,667
You're smiling from ear to ear.

552
00:39:45,767 --> 00:39:46,967
Well, today,

553
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,400
I have no expectations.

554
00:39:48,467 --> 00:39:49,500
Nobody will be there.

555
00:39:51,233 --> 00:39:53,100
Nobody's around on Wednesdays.

556
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,667
Nobody.

557
00:39:55,567 --> 00:39:56,900
This is why I let them in.

558
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:00,900
We barely made it.

559
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:05,166
Tae Hyung, look.

560
00:40:14,233 --> 00:40:15,367
Have some juice.

561
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,400
Get a glass each.

562
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,800
-He's giving us juice.
-Pineapple.

563
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,100
Me too.

564
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:25,600
Just the half.

565
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,533
-Half?
-Yes.

566
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,367
Could you pour some for me too?

567
00:40:28,433 --> 00:40:31,834
Take this for Seo Jun. Two glasses.

568
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,000
Is that tip?

569
00:40:37,066 --> 00:40:39,300
Yeah, look at how much tip I got.

570
00:40:41,133 --> 00:40:42,266
Good for you.

571
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,633
Hey, Seo Jun gave us
a glass of juice each.

572
00:40:47,567 --> 00:40:49,333
Man, that's really good.

573
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,900
I need at least two, three tissues.

574
00:41:02,367 --> 00:41:04,500
Call a plumber. Something's leaking.

575
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:12,300
Thank you very much.

576
00:41:12,367 --> 00:41:13,533
What is it?

577
00:41:14,567 --> 00:41:17,100
It's made with honey and sticky rice.

578
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,734
It's very sweet.

579
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,066
It's a perfect dessert after spicy food.

580
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:26,800
I'll try one.

581
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,333
It's like a tasty cookie.

582
00:41:36,767 --> 00:41:38,800
This is a dessert.

583
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,934
It's a traditional Korean dessert.

584
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:43,266
I've never had this.

585
00:41:43,266 --> 00:41:45,066
No, I'm so excited.

586
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,500
This looks amazing.

587
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,100
Not what I expected.

588
00:41:53,133 --> 00:41:55,100
That's really good.

589
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,700
It's not too sweet.

590
00:41:58,066 --> 00:41:58,900
Dessert?

591
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:04,300
It's Korean traditional candy made
with honey and sticky rice.

592
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,333
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

593
00:42:07,033 --> 00:42:10,166
I should ask him
to work for my restaurant.

594
00:42:10,233 --> 00:42:12,300
As if he's gonna take it.

595
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,533
Is it good?

596
00:42:21,667 --> 00:42:22,667
Yeah.

597
00:42:37,867 --> 00:42:39,266
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

598
00:42:44,367 --> 00:42:45,633
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

599
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:47,700
-Really good.
-Thanks for coming again.

600
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,934
See you tomorrow.

601
00:43:05,834 --> 00:43:07,266
Amigo.

602
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:09,934
-Marvel guy.
-Oh, really?

603
00:43:10,033 --> 00:43:11,133
Yes, I am.

604
00:43:11,233 --> 00:43:12,600
Which movie?

605
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:14,700
Captain Marvel.

606
00:43:14,767 --> 00:43:15,867
Oh, really?

607
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,600
The next one.

608
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,166
-Wow.
-Wow.

609
00:43:20,233 --> 00:43:21,166
That's cool.

610
00:43:21,233 --> 00:43:25,266
I have a question.
Have you known each other already?

611
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:27,867
We were all friends before.

612
00:43:28,934 --> 00:43:30,000
Do you know BTS?

613
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:31,700
-Yeah.
-BTS.

614
00:43:31,767 --> 00:43:33,834
-Wow.
-BTS.

615
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,500
For you, it must be so strange
that we don't recognize you.

616
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,233
In your country, it must be very difficult
for you to walk on streets.

617
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:47,133
Yeah.

618
00:43:47,233 --> 00:43:49,900
Do you like that
you can walk around freely here?

619
00:43:49,967 --> 00:43:52,100
Being a regular person.

620
00:43:52,934 --> 00:43:54,300
The thing is

621
00:43:54,367 --> 00:43:57,934
we're so busy we can't go out to hang out.

622
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,233
But

623
00:43:59,734 --> 00:44:02,567
if our boss lets us go out, maybe.

624
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:06,633
How was the food?

625
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,834
-So good.
-Amazing.

626
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,767
-Oh, my. It was good.
-It was amazing.

627
00:44:10,633 --> 00:44:12,000
Professional chef level.

628
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,934
-Yeah? Thank you.
-Especially the chicken.

629
00:44:15,033 --> 00:44:16,333
Chicken, chicken.

630
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,367
Thank you.

631
00:44:22,433 --> 00:44:23,600
The chicken, amazing.

632
00:44:26,033 --> 00:44:27,500
Okay. How can I put it?

633
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:31,266
So the man behind me.

634
00:44:31,333 --> 00:44:33,333
He's like

635
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:38,633
a member of one
of the most famous boy bands.

636
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:40,500
The best boy band in the world.

637
00:44:40,567 --> 00:44:42,600
The best in the world.

638
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:43,600
They're the dopest…

639
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,700
I'm sure he has 300 million followers.

640
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:49,367
Their video must be
the most watched video on YouTube.

641
00:44:49,467 --> 00:44:53,100
They're on another level.
Justin-Bieber-level.

642
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,200
Imagine that Americans go to Korea

643
00:44:56,266 --> 00:44:58,800
to film some YouTube videos

644
00:44:58,867 --> 00:45:01,967
where Drake and Post Malone
work in a restaurant.

645
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:06,367
And people ask them who they are.
This is just like that.

646
00:45:11,734 --> 00:45:13,967
Now, I have no energy.

647
00:45:14,033 --> 00:45:15,834
Muy bien. Hey, hey, hey.

648
00:45:23,133 --> 00:45:26,066
-Alright, thank you.
-See you.

649
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,133
Tomorrow, I want you to leave at 11 AM.

650
00:45:34,433 --> 00:45:38,533
We didn't have many customers
in the first half, did we?

651
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,200
Don't you think it's okay to start late?

652
00:45:41,934 --> 00:45:43,166
I wish we only did dinner.

653
00:45:43,233 --> 00:45:45,133
That would be the best.

654
00:45:45,834 --> 00:45:48,000
Seo Jun has something to say to you.

655
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,567
What?

656
00:45:49,667 --> 00:45:51,100
Seo Jun has something to say.

657
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,100
-What?
-What?

658
00:45:53,567 --> 00:45:54,700
Well…

659
00:45:55,066 --> 00:45:57,967
I was thinking maybe we could do
the dinner service only.

660
00:45:58,066 --> 00:45:59,600
-Only the dinner service?
-Yes.

661
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,300
-Just tomorrow.
-The first half was pretty slow.

662
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:04,600
We need some sleep.

663
00:46:04,633 --> 00:46:07,667
And recover from fatigue too.

664
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:11,500
Maybe we focus on the dinner service and…

665
00:46:11,567 --> 00:46:13,300
But we only have three days left.

666
00:46:13,367 --> 00:46:15,767
And after 7:30 PM,
we don't get any orders.

667
00:46:15,834 --> 00:46:17,800
No one comes to have dinner after that.

668
00:46:17,867 --> 00:46:19,233
Only 7:30 PM?

669
00:46:19,300 --> 00:46:21,700
Yeah, we've never had
any orders after that time.

670
00:46:23,467 --> 00:46:24,734
So…

671
00:46:24,834 --> 00:46:27,700
If we open only for dinner,

672
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,800
we'll be open just for a few hours.

673
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:32,667
Then how about we open at 3 PM
and have no break?

674
00:46:33,266 --> 00:46:35,500
I bet you'll want the break.

675
00:46:35,567 --> 00:46:38,500
We get almost no customers
between 2 to 4 PM.

676
00:46:38,567 --> 00:46:40,467
We get some between 2 to 4 PM.

677
00:46:40,533 --> 00:46:42,066
Even today. It was full.

678
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,734
Around 2:30 PM. Am I wrong?

679
00:46:45,133 --> 00:46:47,700
We've got to decide what to prep tomorrow

680
00:46:47,767 --> 00:46:49,266
to decide when to come.

681
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:50,834
-Cucumbers, carrots…
-What?

682
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,066
Cucumbers and carrots. And?

683
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,166
Pork marinade, bulgogi…

684
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,767
-And pork.
-See? We've got so much to do.

685
00:46:58,834 --> 00:47:00,266
Come early tomorrow.

686
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:02,266
Let's go have dinner.

687
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:05,066
Woo Shik, you've been working
for only two days here.

688
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:06,533
-Seo Jin…
-And we made

689
00:47:06,567 --> 00:47:08,200
10,000 pesos both days.

690
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:10,100
-What?
-Seo Jin.

691
00:47:10,166 --> 00:47:12,233
I worked really hard, didn't I?

692
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,200
What are you saying? That's a given.

693
00:47:14,233 --> 00:47:15,767
You took all the tip.

694
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,233
-What?
-Only you get the tip.

695
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:19,633
-That's all mine?
-That's what I heard.

696
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,734
-I see.
-Seo Jin gave it to you.

697
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,667
-It's all yours.
-I'll work harder.

698
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,734
I'll work hard.

699
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:29,100
-Woo Shik.
-Yes?

700
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:31,767
You and Tae Hyung will leave
at 11:30 AM tomorrow.

701
00:47:31,867 --> 00:47:33,633
-I'll leave at 10 AM.
-What?

702
00:47:35,266 --> 00:47:36,667
-I'll leave at ten.
-What…

703
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:39,066
If you leave at ten, he has to as well.

704
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:40,400
What?

705
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:41,533
Ask him.

706
00:47:41,633 --> 00:47:43,100
He said it. I said 11:30 AM.

707
00:47:43,133 --> 00:47:44,367
-What about noon?
-No.

708
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,800
That'll be too late.

709
00:47:45,867 --> 00:47:48,667
Are the chefs leaving at noon then?

710
00:47:48,734 --> 00:47:50,834
So the chefs are leaving at noon?

711
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,233
Then…

712
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,133
let's settle at 11 AM.

713
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,600
-He said 11:30 AM!
-Okay.

714
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,266
-Fine.
-Leave then if you want.

715
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,567
All right. 11:30 AM.

716
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:01,066
We need chicken tomorrow, right?

717
00:48:01,133 --> 00:48:02,967
-We need it every day.
-Right.

718
00:48:03,066 --> 00:48:05,567
You need to leave early
because of chicken.

719
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:08,000
Next to the clothing store
and fruit store…

720
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,367
-Why would you go to a clothing store?
-What?

721
00:48:10,467 --> 00:48:11,867
Why would you go there?

722
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,900
The clothing store?

723
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,233
Why would you go there?

724
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:19,100
I never told you to go
to a clothing store.

725
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:24,333
All right. Good work, everyone!

726
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,734
-Woo Shik.
-Yes.

727
00:48:25,767 --> 00:48:27,700
It's easier than Youn's Stay, right?

728
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:28,767
This is harder.

729
00:48:28,834 --> 00:48:31,567
There, you had to run up and down
the hills.

730
00:48:31,633 --> 00:48:33,367
Right. Still, this is harder.

731
00:48:33,433 --> 00:48:35,066
-Is it?
-I also think

732
00:48:35,166 --> 00:48:37,734
this is the toughest moment in my life.

733
00:48:37,834 --> 00:48:39,133
Now you're lying.

734
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:42,567
Seo Jun also said
this was the hardest shoot ever.

735
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:44,333
The number of ramyeons

736
00:48:44,433 --> 00:48:46,100
-I cooked today is…
-How many?

737
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,333
probably comparable to most
snack bar owners.

738
00:48:50,033 --> 00:48:51,700
Why is this so hard?

739
00:48:51,767 --> 00:48:53,066
Hard for you?

740
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:55,100
No.

741
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:56,367
I'm fine.

742
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,567
I heard today's moon is the prettiest.

743
00:49:38,133 --> 00:49:40,567
It was such a fun day today.

744
00:49:40,633 --> 00:49:42,266
It was better than yesterday.

745
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,400
-Much better.
-Yes.

746
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,667
I was talking to this guy.

747
00:50:21,767 --> 00:50:24,433
I wanna go home.

748
00:50:29,567 --> 00:50:31,834
I wanna go home.

749
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:37,266
No, you can't go home, it says.

750
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:38,266
Let's go.

751
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:41,033
Let's go swimming!

752
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:42,500
Let's go swimming!

753
00:50:45,066 --> 00:50:46,333
Let's go swimming.

754
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,600
We haven't used the pool.

755
00:50:49,567 --> 00:50:50,567
No?

756
00:51:02,166 --> 00:51:04,400
-What happened?
-Did someone push him?

757
00:51:04,467 --> 00:51:05,433
Did he just jump in?

758
00:51:05,467 --> 00:51:07,333
Did he jump himself or was he pushed?

759
00:51:09,033 --> 00:51:11,066
-Come on. Let's swim.
-Go ahead and swim.

760
00:51:11,133 --> 00:51:12,734
The producer pushed him.

761
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,734
Really?

762
00:51:19,967 --> 00:51:21,200
Isn't the water cold?

763
00:51:21,266 --> 00:51:23,000
Not at all.

764
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,367
It's refreshing.

765
00:51:28,433 --> 00:51:30,166
Be careful not to bang your head.

766
00:51:31,667 --> 00:51:33,000
It's so refreshing, come.

767
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,133
What?

768
00:51:39,834 --> 00:51:41,800
-Where's the moon, by the way?
-Look.

769
00:51:41,867 --> 00:51:44,533
-You're right. I see it.
-Over there. Do you see it?

770
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,867
That's Mars.

771
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:47,600
Oh, that's Mars?

772
00:51:47,667 --> 00:51:50,367
Yeah, the tiny one. That's Mars.

773
00:51:50,433 --> 00:51:53,033
-How did you know?
-It was on the news today.

774
00:51:53,100 --> 00:51:55,233
So that's Mars, huh?

775
00:51:55,333 --> 00:51:57,133
A once-in-a-lifetime chance.

776
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:03,867
How about
we have a super cozy time together,

777
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:05,834
drinking some wine on the deck?

778
00:52:05,934 --> 00:52:07,533
Sounds good. Let's go.

779
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,433
Tae Hyung, join us.

780
00:52:10,767 --> 00:52:11,734
This is amazing.

781
00:52:26,367 --> 00:52:29,567
Are they not cold?
Look at them hanging out there.

782
00:52:30,633 --> 00:52:32,633
But it's so chilly out here.

783
00:52:32,734 --> 00:52:34,767
It's 20°C at night here.

784
00:52:34,867 --> 00:52:37,900
What are they doing?

785
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,500
Maybe we should get them a blanket.

786
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:43,033
Just put it on yourself.

787
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:45,934
Jeez, I'm cold.

788
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:53,367
When it's chilly in summer,
sheep wool blankets can be useful.

789
00:52:58,467 --> 00:52:59,567
This is perfect.

790
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,734
You're coming back already?

791
00:53:13,367 --> 00:53:16,300
-They came back at midnight sharp.
-He was going to join.

792
00:53:16,367 --> 00:53:18,734
I'm sure it was Seo Jun's idea.

793
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,734
Let's ask.

794
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,333
Tonight's last interview.

795
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,834
It's the last interview.

796
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,467
While you were having a great time
drinking together,

797
00:53:26,533 --> 00:53:30,567
someone must have said,
"Let's get inside now."

798
00:53:30,633 --> 00:53:31,734
Out of you three,

799
00:53:33,266 --> 00:53:35,567
was it Seo Jun?

800
00:53:35,667 --> 00:53:37,767
Wait. Who do you think it was?

801
00:53:37,867 --> 00:53:40,033
Well, I didn't say what I think yet,

802
00:53:40,133 --> 00:53:43,133
but Seo Jin said it must've been Seo Jun.

803
00:53:43,233 --> 00:53:44,166
I'd say Woo Shik.

804
00:53:44,266 --> 00:53:46,100
Wait. Then who picked me?

805
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,300
No one.

806
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:49,567
-Yourself.
-Why no one?

807
00:53:49,633 --> 00:53:52,400
I'm sure you insisted to stay longer.

808
00:53:52,467 --> 00:53:53,600
No, I didn't.

809
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:56,333
If it was Woo Shik,

810
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,500
he would've said it
because he's too sleepy.

811
00:54:00,667 --> 00:54:02,567
What if it was Tae Hyung?

812
00:54:02,633 --> 00:54:04,166
Because he wanted ramyeon.

813
00:54:07,734 --> 00:54:08,900
So what's the answer?

814
00:54:10,734 --> 00:54:12,266
It was my suggestion.

815
00:54:13,934 --> 00:54:16,066
-I was right!
-Woo Shik is really tired.

816
00:54:16,166 --> 00:54:18,467
That's why he wanted to go inside.

817
00:54:19,533 --> 00:54:22,233
-Well, Woo Shik…
-Let's just say you're right.

818
00:54:22,300 --> 00:54:24,066
"I wish we could hang out longer,

819
00:54:24,133 --> 00:54:25,433
but let's go back."

820
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:26,867
Is that what Seo Jun said?

821
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:28,133
-Woo Shik.
-It was him.

822
00:54:28,166 --> 00:54:30,300
-Really?
-Wow.

823
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:33,867
That's not what happened.
I'm just tired. Let's go inside.

824
00:54:33,934 --> 00:54:36,000
Because I'm so tired. I'm sleepy.

825
00:54:36,066 --> 00:54:38,333
-Good night.
-Thanks. Good night.

826
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:02,567
-Hi.
-Did the boys go?

827
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,233
-Did the boys go?
-A while ago.

828
00:56:04,266 --> 00:56:05,867
They did? Well, that's new.

829
00:56:08,033 --> 00:56:09,500
This never happened before.

830
00:56:11,533 --> 00:56:15,300
It's so unusual
that they left on their own.

831
00:56:16,734 --> 00:56:19,934
Show me. Show me who you are.

832
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:23,834
Hola, hi. Hola.

833
00:56:26,166 --> 00:56:27,533
Hi. Hola.

834
00:56:29,533 --> 00:56:30,834
Amiga?

835
00:56:30,934 --> 00:56:31,934
Yes.

836
00:56:34,266 --> 00:56:35,333
-Gracias.
-Gracias.

837
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,367
-Hasta luego, Ingrid.
-Hasta luego.

838
00:56:39,133 --> 00:56:41,734
-Okay.
-Yo, yo, yo.

839
00:56:43,834 --> 00:56:44,767
All right.

840
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:47,900
I'm gonna show them.

841
00:56:47,967 --> 00:56:51,867
I will show you the completely changed me

842
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:56,333
-What time is it?
-Let's park here.

843
00:56:56,433 --> 00:56:58,266
-No.
-Park here.

844
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:59,800
-Can we park here?
-Yes.

845
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:01,967
-Then I'll park on the other side.
-Okay.

846
00:57:06,200 --> 00:57:08,300
I think it's more behind.

847
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:09,633
-Is this not it?
-No.

848
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:11,700
Thank you.

849
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,700
Shall we go?

850
00:57:32,800 --> 00:57:33,800
Let's go.

851
00:58:03,834 --> 00:58:05,900
Intern Kim, let's do this.

852
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,100
-Hey, amigo.
-Amigo.

853
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,066
Amigo.

854
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:14,734
How much rice should I cook today?

855
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:47,266
You're about to open for Thursday.

856
00:58:48,533 --> 00:58:50,600
What's your sales goal for today?

857
00:58:52,533 --> 00:58:54,600
Well, for today,

858
00:58:54,667 --> 00:58:55,967
I'd say 5,000 pesos?

859
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,400
Although 7,500 is my line in the sand.

860
00:58:59,233 --> 00:59:01,033
Your line for what?

861
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,600
Why are you so obsessed with 7,500?

862
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,567
It's 500,000 in Korean won.

863
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:09,033
We're five people. We should make
at least 100,000 won each.

864
00:59:15,033 --> 00:59:17,367
Ask Yu Mi about her resolution for today.

865
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:19,700
What's your resolution for today?

866
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,667
For today?

867
00:59:20,734 --> 00:59:22,300
I think we'll do great.

868
00:59:22,367 --> 00:59:26,633
Actually, Seo Jin, Yu Mi's prediction
has been accurate so far.

869
00:59:28,066 --> 00:59:29,967
She got her position for a reason.

870
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:35,300
I've been watching you guys
for a week now,

871
00:59:35,367 --> 00:59:38,700
and only one person here
advise you frankly.

872
00:59:38,767 --> 00:59:41,233
That's Yu Mi.

873
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:43,767
-That means she cares about you the most.
-Right.

874
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,433
-The rest of them…
-Even if you make silly choices…

875
00:59:46,433 --> 00:59:48,734
They just try to make points with you.

876
00:59:49,367 --> 00:59:50,567
In a way…

877
00:59:51,567 --> 00:59:53,100
I am…

878
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,400
even better than the boss here.

879
00:59:59,266 --> 01:00:01,533
Then what's your sales goal for today?

880
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,133
I'd say over 10,000 pesos.

881
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:04,266
Over 10,000?

882
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:05,300
We did it yesterday.

883
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,800
-Today too?
-Yes.

884
01:00:08,467 --> 01:00:10,433
-The boss just said 5,000.
-What?

885
01:00:10,533 --> 01:00:14,500
Then don't get upset
if we make 7,500 or 5,000.

886
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:15,500
I won't.

887
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,467
-Well…
-Really? You promised.

888
01:00:17,533 --> 01:00:19,133
When did I get upset?

889
01:00:24,033 --> 01:00:25,266
All right. Let's go.

890
01:00:25,333 --> 01:00:27,400
The rain won't stop.

891
01:00:28,266 --> 01:00:29,600
We're leaving now.

892
01:00:39,467 --> 01:00:41,066
Just a second.

893
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,133
Wello.

894
01:00:54,867 --> 01:00:56,233
I mean, hello.

895
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:57,600
How's everything?

896
01:00:57,667 --> 01:00:59,767
Good. I just finished prepping rice.

897
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,934
-Hi.
-Hey.

898
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,033
Hello!

899
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,700
-Hello.
-Hello!

900
01:01:07,767 --> 01:01:08,767
Hola.

901
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,133
Shouldn't we prep the meat today?

902
01:01:11,233 --> 01:01:12,767
Just the bulgogi.

903
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,266
We should do spicy pork too.

904
01:01:14,300 --> 01:01:15,133
-Spicy pork?
-Yes.

905
01:01:15,166 --> 01:01:17,633
-What about the marinade?
-We've got the bulgogi,

906
01:01:17,667 --> 01:01:19,734
but we need more prep for spicy pork.

907
01:01:19,767 --> 01:01:21,900
Grate the carrots and cucumbers too.

908
01:01:32,266 --> 01:01:33,300
What?

909
01:01:34,367 --> 01:01:35,333
Because you're good.

910
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,867
You're so good at this.

911
01:01:37,367 --> 01:01:40,467
You're so skilled.

912
01:01:42,367 --> 01:01:43,934
You spill things though.

913
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:45,767
Like I've always been doing this.

914
01:01:45,867 --> 01:01:46,800
Yes.

915
01:02:15,100 --> 01:02:17,066
Woo Shik, you got this.

916
01:02:18,633 --> 01:02:20,734
Yu Mi, about the meat…

917
01:02:20,834 --> 01:02:23,066
Is that a good amount? Two packs each?

918
01:02:23,767 --> 01:02:24,900
Pork.

919
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,500
We need one more pack, right?

920
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:27,500
Two packs each?

921
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:28,834
Yeah, two packs each.

922
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:47,266
Woo Shik, you didn't fry the chicken yet?

923
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:48,934
I'm heating the oil now.

924
01:02:48,967 --> 01:02:50,200
We're an hour away.

925
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:53,600
Are you not feeling well?

926
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,133
-Sorry?
-Are you not well?

927
01:02:56,066 --> 01:02:58,633
-Well…
-Just to make sure your body doesn't ache.

928
01:02:59,133 --> 01:03:00,200
No, right?

929
01:03:01,166 --> 01:03:02,367
No, it doesn't.

930
01:03:03,433 --> 01:03:04,433
Answer me.

931
01:03:04,834 --> 01:03:05,900
I don't know.

932
01:03:05,967 --> 01:03:06,967
You're fine, right?

933
01:03:10,266 --> 01:03:11,567
-Woo Shik.
-Yeah?

934
01:03:11,633 --> 01:03:13,400
If you're tired, go take some rest.

935
01:03:13,967 --> 01:03:16,133
Not without my permission.

936
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,667
After I finish the morning prep.

937
01:03:21,367 --> 01:03:22,934
All right!

938
01:03:27,033 --> 01:03:28,667
Seo Jun, are you cheering up?

939
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,367
-I'm cheering up.
-Good.

940
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:34,400
-Is the frying going well?
-Yup.

941
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:42,800
You're really good at frying chicken now.

942
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,100
I think I got the hang of it now.

943
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,100
Whoa, done.

944
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:14,567
We got 30 minutes left.

945
01:05:21,633 --> 01:05:23,633
Yu Mi, you heard me. 30 minutes.

946
01:05:26,467 --> 01:05:28,166
-Vámonos!
-Vámonos!

947
01:05:28,233 --> 01:05:29,633
Woo Shik, vámonos!

948
01:05:29,700 --> 01:05:31,333
All right!

949
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:52,467
Let's do this.

950
01:06:04,734 --> 01:06:06,300
I need some more.

951
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:13,667
It's spicy, but tasty.

952
01:06:14,367 --> 01:06:15,266
Why is it so good?

953
01:06:20,934 --> 01:06:22,266
Gotta remove the water.

954
01:06:22,367 --> 01:06:23,967
We can use this later.

955
01:06:41,934 --> 01:06:43,200
I'm done.

956
01:06:43,266 --> 01:06:44,567
-We don't need it.
-Right.

957
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:47,033
I'm done now.

958
01:07:23,367 --> 01:07:24,767
The rice is cooked well.

959
01:07:24,867 --> 01:07:26,200
-Is it cooked well?
-Yes.

960
01:07:26,300 --> 01:07:27,900
-Nice.
-Nice.

961
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,200
All right!

962
01:07:29,867 --> 01:07:31,433
Seo Jun, are we all set now?

963
01:07:31,533 --> 01:07:33,166
Uh… yes.

964
01:07:33,233 --> 01:07:35,300
-We're opening then.
-Okay.

965
01:07:35,367 --> 01:07:36,400
Okay.

966
01:07:50,100 --> 01:07:52,567
Now we're about to open,
I'm getting revved up.

967
01:07:54,367 --> 01:07:58,367
All right. Let's go!

968
01:08:00,066 --> 01:08:01,400
-Tae Hyung.
-Yes?

969
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:03,734
-I'll show you how to make hellamyeon.
-Okay.

970
01:08:03,834 --> 01:08:05,100
Could you make it today?

971
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:07,600
Hellamyeon?

972
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:09,934
Yes, you just drain the noodles,

973
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,333
add the sauce, and stir-fry them.

974
01:08:14,066 --> 01:08:16,066
-Can you take the corn dogs out?
-Okay.

975
01:08:18,066 --> 01:08:19,200
-Tae Hyung.
-Yes?

976
01:08:19,266 --> 01:08:20,200
Here's the recipe.

977
01:08:20,266 --> 01:08:21,133
AND HIS FIRST SPICY FRICKEN...

978
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:24,533
Simmer it down a little.

979
01:08:27,100 --> 01:08:28,400
I'll show you how.

980
01:08:28,433 --> 01:08:29,500
Watch and try it.

981
01:08:29,533 --> 01:08:30,900
All right.

982
01:08:31,000 --> 01:08:34,500
Tae Hyung,
this is your burner from now on.

983
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:35,533
Okay.

984
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,467
Now, I'm an assistant chef.

985
01:08:39,533 --> 01:08:41,934
I'm sorry,
but I haven't approved of that yet.

986
01:08:41,967 --> 01:08:42,867
Not yet?

987
01:08:42,867 --> 01:08:44,800
No. It'll depend on how you do today.

988
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,500
Oh, you're already an assistant…

989
01:08:47,567 --> 01:08:48,600
I was promoted fast.

990
01:08:48,667 --> 01:08:50,233
Oh, really?

991
01:08:50,767 --> 01:08:53,233
The chef will see how I do it and decide

992
01:08:53,300 --> 01:08:55,233
if he'll make me an assistant chef.

993
01:08:55,300 --> 01:08:56,166
Really?

994
01:08:56,233 --> 01:08:58,333
I'm making hellamyeon today.

995
01:08:58,400 --> 01:08:59,533
Oh, really?

996
01:09:01,100 --> 01:09:02,000
What's the matter?

997
01:09:02,033 --> 01:09:04,633
Are you upset
because I'm getting promoted first?

998
01:09:04,734 --> 01:09:06,200
Thought we'd only be interns?

999
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:07,834
No, that's not it.

1000
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:10,266
I'm just jealous.

1001
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:11,900
They're in the kitchen

1002
01:09:11,967 --> 01:09:13,867
and you're in the service area.

1003
01:09:13,934 --> 01:09:15,400
Right.

1004
01:09:15,467 --> 01:09:16,533
-Woo Shik.
-Yes?

1005
01:09:16,533 --> 01:09:18,200
Our pay will be different too.

1006
01:09:20,533 --> 01:09:22,967
-Three, two, one. Let's go!
-Let's go!

1007
01:09:22,967 --> 01:09:24,533
Smile. Stay positive.

1008
01:09:32,233 --> 01:09:34,066
-Are we open now?
-Yes.

1009
01:09:51,266 --> 01:09:52,166
Hello.

1010
01:09:52,266 --> 01:09:54,667
-Hello. Are you open?
-Yes.

1011
01:09:54,767 --> 01:09:55,600
Just one person?

1012
01:09:55,667 --> 01:09:56,667
Yes.

1013
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,834
I heard this one's so good. Is it?

1014
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:02,233
You have a spicy version?

1015
01:10:02,266 --> 01:10:04,633
Yeah, we have two different kinds.

1016
01:10:21,834 --> 01:10:23,633
Wasn't it too spicy?

1017
01:10:23,700 --> 01:10:25,567
As a Mexican, not so.

1018
01:10:25,633 --> 01:10:26,800
It's very spicy.

1019
01:10:27,433 --> 01:10:28,867
I'm strong, so it's okay.

1020
01:10:30,867 --> 01:10:31,967
It's not that spicy.

1021
01:10:32,066 --> 01:10:32,900
Is it not?

1022
01:10:49,266 --> 01:10:51,300
-One of the spicy one.
-The spicy one?

1023
01:10:51,667 --> 01:10:53,166
It's very spicy, okay?

1024
01:10:54,100 --> 01:10:55,633
How spicy?

1025
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,934
On a scale of one to Mexican?

1026
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:01,834
I think people here like spicy, so…

1027
01:11:01,900 --> 01:11:03,633
-Let's try spicy.
-Okay.

1028
01:11:03,700 --> 01:11:06,300
Let's see
if it's really so good and spicy.

1029
01:11:06,367 --> 01:11:08,667
That's 200.

1030
01:11:12,333 --> 01:11:14,200
This one looks good.

1031
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,233
Then let's order that one and this.

1032
01:11:16,867 --> 01:11:18,700
I like the price.

1033
01:11:18,800 --> 01:11:20,867
So one of this and one of that.

1034
01:11:28,066 --> 01:11:30,033
-Hola.
-Hola.

1035
01:11:30,100 --> 01:11:33,333
We'd like to get one spicy fricken.

1036
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,700
And this one.

1037
01:11:34,767 --> 01:11:36,467
It's this one.

1038
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,934
-Which one?
-One of this.

1039
01:11:39,500 --> 01:11:40,367
Pineapple.

1040
01:11:40,433 --> 01:11:41,734
-Pineapple juice.
-Yes.

1041
01:11:47,367 --> 01:11:48,467
360 pesos.

1042
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,834
I heard
the corn dogs here are really good.

1043
01:11:53,934 --> 01:11:54,800
Yeah?

1044
01:11:54,900 --> 01:11:56,033
That it's got a nice

1045
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:58,433
-We ordered one.
-sweet and sour flavor.

1046
01:11:58,533 --> 01:12:00,900
Hola. How's it going?

1047
01:12:00,967 --> 01:12:02,600
Good. Very good.

1048
01:12:09,734 --> 01:12:11,033
Feel free to join me.

1049
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:13,100
No, not at all. Let's sit together.

1050
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,000
My friends didn't join me, so…
If you're on a date, it's okay.

1051
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:18,533
No, it's okay.

1052
01:12:18,633 --> 01:12:19,567
What did you order?

1053
01:12:19,667 --> 01:12:21,667
We ordered one corn dog and one chicken.

1054
01:12:21,767 --> 01:12:23,200
Which corn dog did you order?

1055
01:12:23,233 --> 01:12:25,166
-Half and half.
-The one with cheese.

1056
01:12:28,166 --> 01:12:29,066
We got an order.

1057
01:12:29,166 --> 01:12:30,633
We got an order!

1058
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:32,867
We got the spicy one.

1059
01:12:34,333 --> 01:12:35,800
-Spicy?
-Hellaspicy fricken.

1060
01:12:35,867 --> 01:12:36,900
Wow.

1061
01:12:39,700 --> 01:12:41,000
Okay.

1062
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:42,867
What is it?

1063
01:12:42,934 --> 01:12:45,266
One spicy fricken

1064
01:12:45,333 --> 01:12:47,567
and one half & half corn dog.

1065
01:12:47,633 --> 01:12:49,567
We should hurry with the chicken.

1066
01:12:50,600 --> 01:12:51,433
Okay.

1067
01:12:53,266 --> 01:12:55,767
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight…

1068
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:00,800
Hello.

1069
01:13:01,867 --> 01:13:03,233
-The menu?
-Hello.

1070
01:13:10,000 --> 01:13:12,033
Let's order bulgogi and tuna.

1071
01:13:23,734 --> 01:13:25,033
Hola.

1072
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:26,667
How many?

1073
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:28,900
Oh, okay.

1074
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:29,900
Two?

1075
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,367
Hola.

1076
01:13:38,467 --> 01:13:39,667
What is it called?

1077
01:13:41,533 --> 01:13:43,100
Name. The name.

1078
01:13:43,166 --> 01:13:44,834
Tteokbokki.

1079
01:13:44,900 --> 01:13:46,333
-Tteokbokki?
-Yes.

1080
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:47,600
¿Cómo te llamas?

1081
01:13:51,166 --> 01:13:52,900
"¿Cómo te llamas?"
means "What is it?"

1082
01:13:52,967 --> 01:13:55,767
-"¿Cómo te llamas?" Yes.
-"What is it?"

1083
01:13:55,834 --> 01:13:57,800
It is tteokbokki.

1084
01:13:57,867 --> 01:14:00,133
This is tteokbokki.

1085
01:14:00,233 --> 01:14:02,300
That's it? Okay.

1086
01:14:11,467 --> 01:14:12,567
-For the table.
-Me?

1087
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:13,467
No, for the table.

1088
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,166
Oh, on the table. Thanks.

1089
01:14:17,967 --> 01:14:20,333
-Will it make a noise or vibrate?
-I think so.

1090
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:25,333
Did they take the green one?

1091
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,734
Yes, the green one.

1092
01:14:27,934 --> 01:14:29,066
They got the skyblue.

1093
01:14:29,367 --> 01:14:30,367
An order.

1094
01:14:30,433 --> 01:14:31,266
We got an order.

1095
01:14:32,133 --> 01:14:33,567
-We got an order.
-Okay.

1096
01:14:37,800 --> 01:14:41,066
When we get customers, it's always a rush.

1097
01:14:44,333 --> 01:14:45,734
Hello.

1098
01:14:46,633 --> 01:14:48,033
How many are you?

1099
01:14:48,867 --> 01:14:50,633
You can order here.

1100
01:14:51,233 --> 01:14:53,633
-A ramyeon.
-One?

1101
01:14:54,133 --> 01:14:55,533
Yes. What would you like?

1102
01:14:55,867 --> 01:14:56,934
The cheese one.

1103
01:14:57,000 --> 01:14:58,500
And one with cheese.

1104
01:14:58,567 --> 01:15:00,100
And a pineapple juice.

1105
01:15:00,166 --> 01:15:01,633
-Pina?
-Piña.

1106
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:02,600
Piña.

1107
01:15:08,867 --> 01:15:09,734
-An order.
-More?

1108
01:15:20,367 --> 01:15:22,900
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1109
01:15:23,967 --> 01:15:26,033
-It's hot today.
-It is.

1110
01:15:36,166 --> 01:15:37,500
We're already full.

1111
01:15:37,567 --> 01:15:38,467
-I know.
-Right?

1112
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:41,367
Should we remove those two tables?

1113
01:15:41,467 --> 01:15:42,834
-In advance.
-Or let's

1114
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,567
ask them to move over to the end.

1115
01:15:44,667 --> 01:15:45,567
If they sit there,

1116
01:15:45,567 --> 01:15:47,200
-we can put two tables.
-Yes.

1117
01:15:50,333 --> 01:15:53,467
Excuse me, but could you sit on that side?

1118
01:15:53,533 --> 01:15:55,433
-Sure.
-Thank you.

1119
01:15:57,166 --> 01:15:58,266
Pardon me.

1120
01:16:02,667 --> 01:16:04,734
There's one more thing for promotion.

1121
01:16:04,734 --> 01:16:05,600
Okay.

1122
01:16:05,633 --> 01:16:07,300
-It's speed.
-Okay.

1123
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,433
-Show me your speed.
-Okay.

1124
01:16:24,166 --> 01:16:25,133
Wow, that's a lot.

1125
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:29,467
-Oh, for the spicy--
-I'll mix these with the regular sauce

1126
01:16:29,533 --> 01:16:31,734
then take out ten pieces
to make hellaspicy.

1127
01:16:32,166 --> 01:16:33,333
Nice.

1128
01:16:36,567 --> 01:16:37,967
All right. Let me…

1129
01:16:41,900 --> 01:16:43,667
They ordered this for a reason.

1130
01:16:48,934 --> 01:16:50,533
The corn dogs must be done.

1131
01:16:50,633 --> 01:16:52,800
-I'll take them out.
-Okay.

1132
01:16:52,867 --> 01:16:54,867
Our teamwork is getting better.

1133
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:57,033
Yes.

1134
01:16:57,100 --> 01:16:58,200
That looks nice.

1135
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:05,900
-Is this the hot one?
-Yes.

1136
01:17:09,767 --> 01:17:10,667
Thank you.

1137
01:17:11,800 --> 01:17:13,233
It's very spicy. Be careful.

1138
01:17:13,834 --> 01:17:14,867
Thank you.

1139
01:17:19,033 --> 01:17:21,734
This is the super spicy one.
If you wanna try it…

1140
01:17:21,834 --> 01:17:24,000
It might be really spicy. Let's see.

1141
01:17:24,100 --> 01:17:25,367
Let's see.

1142
01:17:25,467 --> 01:17:26,533
Let's see.

1143
01:17:34,266 --> 01:17:36,867
In Spanish, napkin is…

1144
01:17:46,066 --> 01:17:47,233
It's not too spicy.

1145
01:17:48,066 --> 01:17:51,100
Let me try it.

1146
01:17:53,533 --> 01:17:54,767
Is it spicier?

1147
01:17:55,133 --> 01:17:56,767
I prefer the spicy one.

1148
01:17:58,467 --> 01:18:00,166
It's not spicy for me.

1149
01:18:01,834 --> 01:18:03,867
Not to Mexicans.

1150
01:18:04,333 --> 01:18:06,200
I should order this one too.

1151
01:18:06,266 --> 01:18:07,667
-This?
-Yes, I'll order one.

1152
01:18:09,867 --> 01:18:11,033
The spicy one?

1153
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:12,300
It's really good.

1154
01:18:12,367 --> 01:18:14,367
-You want it spicy?
-Yes, very spicy.

1155
01:18:14,467 --> 01:18:15,367
Very spicy.

1156
01:18:15,433 --> 01:18:16,934
-Macho?
-Yes.

1157
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:22,500
The man asked, "Very spicy?"
I said, "Yes, very spicy."

1158
01:18:22,567 --> 01:18:23,700
Then he said "macho".

1159
01:18:26,166 --> 01:18:27,934
-We got an order.
-Okay.

1160
01:18:31,567 --> 01:18:34,700
Okay. It was for hellaspicy fricken,
so I'll go wash the pan.

1161
01:18:35,500 --> 01:18:37,367
We got one more hellaspicy fricken.

1162
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:39,200
Okay.

1163
01:18:44,734 --> 01:18:45,934
Happy face.

1164
01:19:03,567 --> 01:19:05,000
Hola. How many?

1165
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:06,100
-Two.
-Two.

1166
01:19:06,533 --> 01:19:08,000
Order over here.

1167
01:19:08,767 --> 01:19:10,467
Hey, we're out of Buddhas now.

1168
01:19:10,533 --> 01:19:12,266
We should call this silver.

1169
01:19:13,033 --> 01:19:13,867
Silver?

1170
01:19:15,066 --> 01:19:16,033
It's bronze.

1171
01:19:16,100 --> 01:19:17,333
Oh, bronze.

1172
01:19:21,834 --> 01:19:24,233
I want cheese ramyeon too.

1173
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:26,100
I'm going for Jinny's Combo.

1174
01:19:40,633 --> 01:19:41,800
One Jinny's Combo...

1175
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,033
It's open, yes.

1176
01:19:55,166 --> 01:19:56,533
-Thank you.
-Gracias.

1177
01:19:57,133 --> 01:19:59,400
-Can I have this?
-The spicy pork?

1178
01:20:10,633 --> 01:20:12,967
-Sprite?
-Thank you.

1179
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:25,600
I can do this.

1180
01:20:48,867 --> 01:20:50,800
-Woo Shik, for the green table.
-Okay.

1181
01:20:51,800 --> 01:20:52,734
Bulgogi gimbap?

1182
01:20:56,667 --> 01:20:57,500
Look.

1183
01:21:19,266 --> 01:21:21,967
Man, we got all kinds of ramyeon.

1184
01:21:22,834 --> 01:21:23,967
That's a lot.

1185
01:21:23,967 --> 01:21:26,333
I think we got more than yesterday.

1186
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:38,300
Could you tell me
how many ramyeons I made today?

1187
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:42,400
-There must be a word going around…
-I'll put them here.

1188
01:21:42,467 --> 01:21:44,600
-Okay. Thank you.
-Sure.

1189
01:22:07,233 --> 01:22:09,500
-That's for the skyblue table.
-Okay.

1190
01:22:09,967 --> 01:22:11,000
Ramyeon?

1191
01:22:13,967 --> 01:22:15,834
-Thank you.
-Bulgogi?

1192
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:20,700
I don't know how to use chopsticks.

1193
01:22:20,734 --> 01:22:22,300
Then use the fork.

1194
01:22:23,667 --> 01:22:25,266
Oh, no, It slipped.

1195
01:22:28,266 --> 01:22:29,300
Like this?

1196
01:22:30,767 --> 01:22:33,533
Or maybe you should
just pick it up with the fork.

1197
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:35,667
I need to learn how to use chopsticks.

1198
01:22:36,567 --> 01:22:39,433
Are there chopsticks for beginners?

1199
01:22:39,500 --> 01:22:41,500
There are some Hello Kitty chopsticks.

1200
01:22:41,567 --> 01:22:45,233
You just need to grab them like this

1201
01:22:45,300 --> 01:22:47,300
and they would open up again.

1202
01:22:47,367 --> 01:22:50,667
Don't grab them too hard.
Try holding them like this.

1203
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,166
Look. I made it.

1204
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:58,200
I've always wanted to try gimbap.

1205
01:23:03,333 --> 01:23:05,900
Cheese, Jinny's Combo, cheese.

1206
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:22,266
For the white table.

1207
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,233
I'm so hungry.

1208
01:23:25,333 --> 01:23:27,300
The smell arouses my appetite.

1209
01:23:27,934 --> 01:23:29,000
It smells so good.

1210
01:23:29,100 --> 01:23:30,166
Yes.

1211
01:23:32,533 --> 01:23:34,166
It's coming.

1212
01:23:37,934 --> 01:23:39,000
Ramyeon.

1213
01:23:39,066 --> 01:23:41,734
-Thank you.
-Cheese?

1214
01:23:45,834 --> 01:23:48,100
Look at us eating hot broth in this heat.

1215
01:23:49,533 --> 01:23:50,900
I didn't think about that.

1216
01:23:52,533 --> 01:23:54,767
My family barely eats warm food.

1217
01:23:54,834 --> 01:23:56,900
I think we mostly eat cold food.

1218
01:23:57,000 --> 01:23:59,166
My family

1219
01:23:59,266 --> 01:24:01,333
eats warm food like this.

1220
01:24:01,433 --> 01:24:03,200
Sometimes, I wait to cool it down.

1221
01:24:03,300 --> 01:24:05,467
But my parents…

1222
01:24:05,567 --> 01:24:08,233
-They don't care.
-They can eat boiling-hot food.

1223
01:24:12,767 --> 01:24:14,233
Are you finished?

1224
01:24:14,300 --> 01:24:15,467
I will finish it.

1225
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:18,333
Sorry about that.

1226
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:23,100
Tae Hyung, what did I say you should prove

1227
01:24:23,166 --> 01:24:24,100
to be promoted?

1228
01:24:24,166 --> 01:24:25,667
-Speed, sir.
-That's right.

1229
01:24:25,734 --> 01:24:27,033
Okay.

1230
01:24:32,533 --> 01:24:33,500
Chicken?

1231
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,300
Yes, coming.

1232
01:24:42,100 --> 01:24:43,800
If you wanna try both…

1233
01:24:43,867 --> 01:24:45,133
Tell me how spicy it is.

1234
01:24:45,200 --> 01:24:47,734
Let's see if they made it extra spicy.

1235
01:24:50,433 --> 01:24:51,834
If it's not spicy, say so.

1236
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:55,667
Is it hot?

1237
01:24:56,367 --> 01:24:57,333
Is it spicy?

1238
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:58,800
Is it hitting you?

1239
01:24:59,667 --> 01:25:00,800
Tell me. Is it spicy?

1240
01:25:01,133 --> 01:25:02,033
It's spicy.

1241
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,567
Is it spicy?

1242
01:25:03,667 --> 01:25:04,567
Try it yourself.

1243
01:25:05,734 --> 01:25:07,667
I'll try the small one here.

1244
01:25:07,767 --> 01:25:08,867
It's spicy.

1245
01:25:09,567 --> 01:25:11,200
Yeah?

1246
01:25:11,300 --> 01:25:12,900
Maybe it's because it's hot.

1247
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:15,066
They did make it spicier. But I'm okay.

1248
01:25:21,133 --> 01:25:22,300
It's really good.

1249
01:25:25,467 --> 01:25:26,767
I love it.

1250
01:25:27,433 --> 01:25:28,867
Honey, you're sweating.

1251
01:25:29,834 --> 01:25:31,667
Is it because of the chili or…

1252
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:32,734
It's because I'm hot.

1253
01:25:32,767 --> 01:25:33,734
I see.

1254
01:25:40,333 --> 01:25:43,967
How about we order the chicken too?
It looks good.

1255
01:25:44,066 --> 01:25:45,233
Order it now.

1256
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,266
-We got an order.
-Okay.

1257
01:25:52,333 --> 01:25:53,333
Another chicken?

1258
01:25:53,367 --> 01:25:54,433
It's a chicken order.

1259
01:25:55,367 --> 01:25:57,266
I want the chicken that man is eating.

1260
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:01,100
It would be rude to look back, right?

1261
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:07,467
I wonder what it's like.

1262
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:25,633
It's an extra order.

1263
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:29,533
Chicken?

1264
01:26:32,100 --> 01:26:33,834
Hey, that's it.

1265
01:26:34,967 --> 01:26:36,100
That's the chicken.

1266
01:26:42,767 --> 01:26:45,133
The corn dog looks amazing too.

1267
01:26:45,233 --> 01:26:46,734
Should we order both?

1268
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:48,233
Yeah.

1269
01:26:48,934 --> 01:26:50,233
There were two kinds.

1270
01:26:50,266 --> 01:26:53,166
Order the biggest one. I'll pay.

1271
01:26:55,767 --> 01:26:57,867
One more of which one?

1272
01:26:57,934 --> 01:27:00,867
I want two of these.

1273
01:27:00,934 --> 01:27:01,767
And…

1274
01:27:02,066 --> 01:27:04,600
-One of this.
-One of this?

1275
01:27:05,934 --> 01:27:07,500
It's 210 pesos.

1276
01:27:07,867 --> 01:27:09,467
Give this to the back kitchen.

1277
01:27:11,533 --> 01:27:13,300
-When we're busy…
-An order's in.

1278
01:27:13,367 --> 01:27:14,400
Okay.

1279
01:27:15,100 --> 01:27:16,233
He won't let me talk.

1280
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:19,633
-What is it?
-Two half & half tater dogs and…

1281
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:21,166
One more chicken?

1282
01:27:22,867 --> 01:27:25,867
We should change our restaurant name.

1283
01:27:25,967 --> 01:27:27,700
Jinny's Boneless Chicken.

1284
01:27:28,800 --> 01:27:31,934
-We got two half and half tater dogs.
-Okay.

1285
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:33,633
You're getting faster.

1286
01:27:33,700 --> 01:27:37,433
Come on. I'm a rapper.

1287
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:39,800
A-yo. Wassup.

1288
01:28:07,734 --> 01:28:10,867
-For the combo for the bronze table.
-Jinny's Combo.

1289
01:28:26,967 --> 01:28:28,433
Thank you.

1290
01:28:43,967 --> 01:28:45,200
The chicken is so good.

1291
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:48,500
I should come back here.

1292
01:28:48,567 --> 01:28:50,200
I wanna be a regular here.

1293
01:28:50,400 --> 01:28:53,533
HE WANTS TO BE A REGULAR

1294
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:55,200
I'll have it.

1295
01:29:02,633 --> 01:29:03,800
I'll eat it like this.

1296
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,600
Tae Hyung, I think

1297
01:29:23,667 --> 01:29:26,500
we should use less of this
and more of the spicy one.

1298
01:29:27,667 --> 01:29:29,700
-No, enough.
-It's not the spicy one.

1299
01:29:29,767 --> 01:29:32,033
-Oh, it's not hellaspicy fricken?
-No.

1300
01:29:32,133 --> 01:29:33,467
I thought it was that one.

1301
01:29:33,567 --> 01:29:34,967
Chef.

1302
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:38,967
Wait. Defiance can affect

1303
01:29:39,066 --> 01:29:40,834
your promotion greatly.

1304
01:29:40,934 --> 01:29:42,834
-No, I mean…
-Exactly.

1305
01:29:42,934 --> 01:29:44,200
your choice was right.

1306
01:29:44,266 --> 01:29:45,166
Your eyes.

1307
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:47,066
Good.

1308
01:29:56,767 --> 01:29:57,900
Wassup.

1309
01:30:08,934 --> 01:30:10,166
Chicken?

1310
01:30:13,967 --> 01:30:15,266
Thank you.

1311
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:19,166
Happy?

1312
01:30:22,400 --> 01:30:23,667
Love it.

1313
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:28,033
-It's really good.
-I can't pick it up.

1314
01:30:31,000 --> 01:30:32,633
It's so good.

1315
01:30:32,700 --> 01:30:34,467
It's really tasty.

1316
01:30:35,834 --> 01:30:38,934
You know what I really like?

1317
01:30:39,033 --> 01:30:45,200
Something that is sweet and spicy
at the same time.

1318
01:30:45,300 --> 01:30:49,266
This reminds me of mole.

1319
01:30:57,333 --> 01:30:59,934
I should bring my mom here tomorrow.

1320
01:31:07,967 --> 01:31:10,734
-Oh, let me do it.
-Okay.

1321
01:31:10,834 --> 01:31:13,100
I can't do it if you're standing there.

1322
01:31:13,667 --> 01:31:16,467
No, forget it. just put it there.

1323
01:31:16,567 --> 01:31:17,867
One more corn dog.

1324
01:31:21,133 --> 01:31:22,333
Here you go.

1325
01:31:22,433 --> 01:31:23,967
Thank you.

1326
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,767
Is it good?

1327
01:31:39,333 --> 01:31:43,166
Guys, I had a great time.
Now I should head back to work.

1328
01:31:43,233 --> 01:31:44,800
Or maybe just ditch work today.

1329
01:31:51,500 --> 01:31:52,633
Have a good time.

1330
01:31:52,734 --> 01:31:54,133
Thank you. See you later.

1331
01:31:54,233 --> 01:31:56,100
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1332
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:05,800
We're done.

1333
01:32:13,567 --> 01:32:15,033
That went well.

1334
01:32:18,433 --> 01:32:19,900
-Woo Shik.
-Yes?

1335
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:20,867
Come on out.

1336
01:32:23,433 --> 01:32:24,400
Hola.

1337
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:26,000
We have more customers.

1338
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:28,633
Excuse me, we have no seats. No tables.

1339
01:32:28,734 --> 01:32:30,367
We must be getting famous here.

1340
01:32:32,233 --> 01:32:33,266
We hit the number?

1341
01:32:34,300 --> 01:32:37,900
Wow, I'm completely worn out today.

1342
01:32:41,300 --> 01:32:42,667
I don't wanna eat anything.

1343
01:32:43,433 --> 01:32:45,867
Now, I'm starting to forget
what my job was.

1344
01:32:47,467 --> 01:32:50,700
No. I can't do this anymore.

1345
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:52,166
Take some rest.

1346
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:55,233
Prep or rest, do whatever you need to do.

1347
01:32:55,333 --> 01:32:57,500
Should we grab some food?
Aren't you hungry?

1348
01:32:57,600 --> 01:33:00,200
-No, I wanna rest.
-What?

1349
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:02,200
-I don't want it either.
-Me neither.

1350
01:33:02,300 --> 01:33:04,133
I have no appetite.

1351
01:33:04,200 --> 01:33:07,233
Our business is becoming successful, but…

1352
01:33:07,300 --> 01:33:09,467
our morale is sagging.

1353
01:33:15,100 --> 01:33:16,400
We're off tomorrow.

1354
01:33:17,266 --> 01:33:18,133
Not the whole day.

1355
01:33:18,200 --> 01:33:20,100
Right. Only the morning time.

1356
01:33:21,667 --> 01:33:24,600
Let's go!

1357
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:30,033
This is youth!

1358
01:33:33,233 --> 01:33:34,233
Three pineapples?

1359
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,967
All they think about is playing.

1360
01:33:38,033 --> 01:33:39,166
Unbelievable.

1361
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:35,700
