00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:26,000
JINNY'S KITCHEN

2
00:00:26,066 --> 00:00:27,834
Business is going well.

3
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,367
- I'll take this combo.
- Chicken, please.

4
00:00:31,433 --> 00:00:32,333
New order.

5
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,266
It's a chicken order?

6
00:00:38,467 --> 00:00:41,600
- Just one more.
- They said the chicken's amazing.

7
00:00:42,066 --> 00:00:43,166
Hello.

8
00:00:45,266 --> 00:00:47,066
- This one?
- Yes.

9
00:00:47,967 --> 00:00:48,867
We got an order.

10
00:00:48,934 --> 00:00:49,834
New order.

11
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,834
- Oh my gosh.
- We only have two portions left.

12
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,834
We might run out of chickens.

13
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:55,767
One gimbap.

14
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,934
Again?

15
00:00:59,633 --> 00:01:00,700
One more.

16
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:03,066
Wait, it's okay to take my time, right?

17
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:13,500
First, second, and then third table.

18
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,633
In this order.

19
00:01:31,233 --> 00:01:34,867
Check the color
and if they're too brown, take them out.

20
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:36,333
That's a good color.

21
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:03,500
Thank you.

22
00:02:10,934 --> 00:02:12,900
She can't seem to keep quiet.

23
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,066
- What's this?
- It's…

24
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,300
For the white table.

25
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,700
- All for the white table?
- Yes.

26
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,533
Next is the black table.

27
00:02:47,633 --> 00:02:49,133
Two more chickens?

28
00:02:49,233 --> 00:02:51,200
Throw these away.

29
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:52,967
So three chickens in total.

30
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:04,533
That's yours, right?

31
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,000
Yes.

32
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,600
Thank you.

33
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:10,900
Be careful, Mateo. It's hot.

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Looks delicious.

35
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,600
That's yours. Look.

36
00:03:17,266 --> 00:03:18,133
It has potatoes.

37
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:20,133
- With cheese?
- Yes.

38
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,533
That's the original.

39
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:24,767
This has sausage, cheese, and potatoes.

40
00:03:26,834 --> 00:03:29,333
- One gimbap?
- Yes.

41
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
Looks yummy. Look.

42
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:32,767
Take a bite.

43
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:41,900
It has a sausage inside. Take a bite.

44
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:49,200
Look. Like this.

45
00:03:51,233 --> 00:03:52,266
It's good.

46
00:03:52,367 --> 00:03:53,734
It's like a churro.

47
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,800
It tastes good with the sausage.

48
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:57,433
It's really good.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,700
Was something made of potatoes?

50
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:12,734
Potatoes? Yeah.

51
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,700
There was a corn dog

52
00:04:15,767 --> 00:04:18,367
made with sausage, cheese,
and fried potatoes.

53
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:19,767
Why didn't you order it?

54
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:21,700
- You can order it now.
- They have it?

55
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,000
- Yes. Would you like to have one each?
- I want one.

56
00:04:25,066 --> 00:04:27,133
It's a bit embarrassing to order extra.

57
00:04:28,467 --> 00:04:29,500
For potatoes.

58
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,834
For potatoes.

59
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:35,000
We'd like to make an extra order.

60
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,266
- Is that okay?
- Bue… Bueno?

61
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,000
Yes. Is that okay?

62
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,300
- What is it?
- I don't know.

63
00:04:49,367 --> 00:04:51,166
Bread? Maybe she wants bread.

64
00:04:53,934 --> 00:04:55,066
Bread…

65
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:57,233
Does she want bread? She can't be.

66
00:05:02,533 --> 00:05:03,967
I want a potato corn dog.

67
00:05:06,533 --> 00:05:07,934
- Oh, with potatoes.
- Yes.

68
00:05:09,567 --> 00:05:10,667
You want that?

69
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:11,967
- Can I?
- Yes.

70
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,033
One?

71
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,266
- Two.
- Two.

72
00:05:14,433 --> 00:05:15,867
One, one.

73
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:18,767
- One each?
- Okay.

74
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:20,533
- All right.
- Okay?

75
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,000
We got two extra tater dog orders.

76
00:05:23,233 --> 00:05:25,667
One original, and one half-and-half.

77
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,900
Green?

78
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,200
Yup.

79
00:05:52,033 --> 00:05:53,100
Hello.

80
00:05:53,633 --> 00:05:55,367
Chicken. Pollo.

81
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,133
It smells amazing.

82
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,867
What's this?

83
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:13,100
- This.
- Oh, the tater dog.

84
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:24,467
It's really good.
It goes well with the sugar.

85
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:31,100
It's good.

86
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,867
It's a sweet and savory combination.

87
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,667
It has sugar on it.

88
00:07:23,433 --> 00:07:24,500
All right.

89
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,166
- Green?
- Yes.

90
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:46,700
- Hellamyeon?
- That's me. Thank you.

91
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,734
- It's spicy.
- Spicy? Okay.

92
00:07:48,834 --> 00:07:49,734
Thank you.

93
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
Try it.

94
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:53,567
See if it's really spicy.

95
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:58,834
It must taste spicier because it's hot.
Can I try?

96
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,734
Sure.

97
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,433
Is it not spicy?

98
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:13,567
I guess not.

99
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:14,633
Not for Mexicans.

100
00:08:14,734 --> 00:08:15,834
It might have a kick.

101
00:08:15,934 --> 00:08:17,967
Is it very spicy?

102
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:20,600
I wouldn't say it's too spicy,
but a little.

103
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,033
- How is it for you?
- Good.

104
00:08:30,066 --> 00:08:31,400
It's really good.

105
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:33,100
It's spicy, but it's good-spicy.

106
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,166
Not spicy for me.

107
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,133
I really like the sauce.

108
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,033
It's so good.

109
00:08:45,967 --> 00:08:47,667
I want the spiciest menu here.

110
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,433
I love spicy food.

111
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:00,667
My turn. Could you move?

112
00:09:00,734 --> 00:09:02,934
- You like it?
- One second. It is good.

113
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,433
Let me take one last bite.

114
00:09:16,467 --> 00:09:18,333
For the combo, right?

115
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,834
Jinny's Combo B.

116
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:29,600
JINNY'S COMBO B IS DONE

117
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,633
- Jinny combo?
- Thank you.

118
00:09:34,834 --> 00:09:36,166
Thank you.

119
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,300
- For this...
- Yes?

120
00:09:39,934 --> 00:09:42,000
- Cut it.
- Thanks.

121
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,266
Sorry.

122
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:54,033
No table. Sorry.

123
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,667
What do we do? People are waiting.

124
00:10:18,433 --> 00:10:20,400
We're taking it easy.

125
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:24,166
We have too many customers.

126
00:10:24,533 --> 00:10:25,467
We have too many.

127
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:28,333
I'll bring more tables.

128
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,166
- Look at the line.
- I know.

129
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:34,633
Other people who want to eat here.

130
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:35,900
Right. There's a line.

131
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,433
- Thank you.
- Here.

132
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:43,700
- Congrats.
- Thanks.

133
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:45,934
Thank you very much.

134
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,033
Bye-bye.

135
00:10:55,433 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll take the new customers.

136
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,166
Wait, wait.

137
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,934
- One? Two.
- Which one?

138
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,900
- This one.
- Two?

139
00:11:11,967 --> 00:11:13,900
Half-and half.

140
00:11:15,166 --> 00:11:16,533
- Two?
- Yes.

141
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:18,734
Thank you.

142
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,133
We got one more.

143
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,867
- We can't take corn dog orders for now.
- Why?

144
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:25,100
We need more skewers.

145
00:11:28,567 --> 00:11:29,567
What do we do then?

146
00:11:31,467 --> 00:11:33,200
- This is the last one.
- Okay.

147
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,867
So no more corn dog orders?

148
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,000
- Only the original ones.
- Okay.

149
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,467
We're in trouble.
We're out of ingredients.

150
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:41,033
Are we facing a crisis?

151
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,300
I should fry more chicken.

152
00:11:51,266 --> 00:11:53,166
We don't have much tteokbokki too.

153
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:58,200
We're out of ingredients.
What do we do?

154
00:11:58,533 --> 00:12:01,200
This is bad. We're in trouble.

155
00:12:10,834 --> 00:12:11,834
Please order here.

156
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,233
We should order.

157
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,033
Right. Order whatever you want.

158
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:16,600
I told you what I wanted.

159
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:18,300
- Did you order already?
- No. Go.

160
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:19,567
Hello.

161
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:21,600
Hello.

162
00:12:21,633 --> 00:12:24,266
- One?
- Which one?

163
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,934
- Jinny's Combo B.
- Jinny's Combo B?

164
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,967
TTEOKBOKKI

165
00:12:32,033 --> 00:12:34,033
1 SERVING

166
00:12:36,133 --> 00:12:37,467
Did you want this?

167
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Spicy fricken?

168
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,400
No, I wanna have…

169
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:44,767
Combo A?

170
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:53,166
- Tteokbokki?
- Yes.

171
00:12:53,233 --> 00:12:54,567
We don't have it anymore.

172
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:57,100
We ran out of it.

173
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,367
Can we take this order?

174
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,900
- We got an order.
- Okay.

175
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:12,834
Still no corn dog?

176
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:16,033
No, you need to wait a bit.

177
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,700
So how was it?
Which one was your favorite?

178
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,767
Your favorite?

179
00:13:22,867 --> 00:13:24,700
- Everything.
- Everything?

180
00:13:24,767 --> 00:13:26,367
My number one is…

181
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,834
- Hellamyeon.
- Same here.

182
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,900
And my second favorite, the tater dogs.

183
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:36,233
Let's go for them.

184
00:13:36,266 --> 00:13:37,567
Yes. Let's go.

185
00:13:43,633 --> 00:13:45,033
Sorry. We're so busy.

186
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,000
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

187
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,266
- Delicious.
- Thanks for coming.

188
00:13:50,367 --> 00:13:52,867
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much, delicious.

189
00:13:56,867 --> 00:13:59,467
I going to recommend this place a lot.

190
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:00,600
Thank you.

191
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,033
Thank you so much.

192
00:14:04,867 --> 00:14:06,066
Bye.

193
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,367
We're out of tteokbokki too?

194
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,200
- Yes, we have no more tteokbokki.
- No more?

195
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:14,934
Should we close the restaurant?

196
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:17,300
- I think so. We're out of ingredients.
- What?

197
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,967
We ran out of ingredients.

198
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,900
We can't serve food anymore?

199
00:14:26,066 --> 00:14:27,834
So we can't receive customers, huh?

200
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,266
No, not quite yet.

201
00:14:58,433 --> 00:15:01,133
- Could you take this?
- Sure. Let me do it.

202
00:15:26,266 --> 00:15:29,066
I feel like I'm running
a snack bar all by myself.

203
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,767
Can't do this. I'm going home tomorrow.

204
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:07,166
- Woo Shik.
- Yes?

205
00:16:07,266 --> 00:16:08,900
- Is it you, Woo Shik?
- What's up?

206
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,533
This is the bulgogi gimbap
for the skyblue table.

207
00:16:19,533 --> 00:16:21,767
Two bulgogi gimbaps for the skyblue table.

208
00:16:21,834 --> 00:16:23,667
Two bulgogi gimbaps for the skyblue.

209
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:24,800
Wait, Yu Mi.

210
00:16:24,867 --> 00:16:27,133
The plus symbol means Combo.

211
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,967
Combo B.

212
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,567
Combo?

213
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:38,233
- Yes.
- But… This means Combo?

214
00:16:51,567 --> 00:16:53,600
Give this to Yu Mi.

215
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,967
Did you give this to me?

216
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:06,333
Bulgogi gimbap. Two bulgogi gimbap.

217
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:07,667
- For this?
- What?

218
00:17:08,033 --> 00:17:09,934
- Skyblue, yes.
- Seo Jin.

219
00:17:16,734 --> 00:17:19,700
Tteokbokki plus bulgogi.
That means it's a Combo.

220
00:17:19,767 --> 00:17:22,467
Then I'm done.

221
00:17:38,467 --> 00:17:40,433
Combo A and Combo B.

222
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,033
Two tteokbokki.

223
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:49,000
Tae Hyung, could you fry
four dumplings and eight laver rolls?

224
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,000
Okay.

225
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:51,800
- Just heat it for 30 seconds.
- Okay.

226
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,433
Combo.

227
00:18:24,934 --> 00:18:26,300
Excuse me.

228
00:18:26,367 --> 00:18:27,600
- Are you next?
- Yes.

229
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:28,967
- Okay. How many?
- Three.

230
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,200
Three. Okay.

231
00:18:30,233 --> 00:18:33,367
You should come here to order.
The menu is here.

232
00:18:33,433 --> 00:18:34,200
Okay.

233
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:38,233
We're out of these three.

234
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,433
We don't have it.

235
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,800
Seo Jin, all corn dogs are available now.

236
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,900
- They are?
- Yes.

237
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,266
All of them?

238
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:50,633
Sorry. We have them now.

239
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:51,900
What do you recommend?

240
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,266
Well, I recommend chicken,

241
00:18:55,367 --> 00:19:00,300
gimbap, ramyeon, and corn dogs.

242
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,967
We can take ramyeon each
and share other menus.

243
00:19:06,033 --> 00:19:07,567
Maybe we share the chicken?

244
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:09,166
And this one too.

245
00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:11,633
- But this is really spicy.
- I like spicy.

246
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,500
Oh, you like spicy. Okay.

247
00:19:13,567 --> 00:19:15,100
Then I recommend this.

248
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,033
Is it good?

249
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,467
Yeah, of course. Good-spicy.

250
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:22,367
All right. Then this one and this one…

251
00:19:27,367 --> 00:19:28,567
That'll be 950 pesos.

252
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:29,934
Thank you.

253
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:43,500
It's nice to be with my family here.

254
00:19:43,567 --> 00:19:47,066
We can also enjoy
the beautiful view together.

255
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:49,333
Right.

256
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:53,967
We're in Bacalar, a paradise.

257
00:19:59,834 --> 00:20:02,767
Why is this business going well?

258
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,567
Tae Hyung.

259
00:20:06,667 --> 00:20:08,800
We need the fritters for this Combo.

260
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:10,767
How many do we need for the meal box?

261
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:13,033
- It's the same.
- Same?

262
00:20:13,066 --> 00:20:16,100
- Three laver rolls.
- Three laver rolls. Okay.

263
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,233
Let's serve this first.

264
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:18,867
- Skyblue?
- Yeah, serve it first.

265
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:19,900
- Can we serve it now?
- Yes.

266
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:20,667
- Good.
- Skyblue?

267
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,133
Yeah, original for skyblue.
Here take these.

268
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:38,367
Original tteokbokki.

269
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:43,734
It's easier to eat
if you cut it like this.

270
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,900
Okay.

271
00:20:45,867 --> 00:20:48,166
- Into little pieces.
- Thank you.

272
00:20:48,233 --> 00:20:49,900
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

273
00:20:52,266 --> 00:20:53,400
Combo B.

274
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,967
Combo B.

275
00:20:57,767 --> 00:20:59,066
Combo A?

276
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:04,934
Sorry. We're so busy. Sorry about that.

277
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,300
It's okay. Don't worry.

278
00:21:06,834 --> 00:21:08,133
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

279
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:13,367
It looks amazing!

280
00:21:13,433 --> 00:21:17,767
Do you wanna try something spicy?
Korean original ramyeon.

281
00:21:18,066 --> 00:21:19,233
You try first.

282
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,834
- Enjoy.
- Enjoy.

283
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,967
Enjoy your food.

284
00:21:22,033 --> 00:21:24,166
- Likewise.
- Thank you.

285
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:27,400
- How do I hold it?
- This looks amazing.

286
00:21:29,467 --> 00:21:31,700
The server did it so easily.

287
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:33,934
It's slipping in every direction.

288
00:21:35,033 --> 00:21:38,166
It's so slippery.

289
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,033
Done. Try it.

290
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,667
It's really good.

291
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:50,734
I like it.

292
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,066
Mine is spicy, but very delicious.

293
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:11,934
How do you say "Thank you" in Korean?

294
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,633
In Korean, it's "gamsahabnida."

295
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,633
- Gamsahabnida.
- Yes.

296
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,166
It's difficult, right?

297
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,233
I wanna check

298
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,500
if he was on the Korean drama I watched.

299
00:22:31,033 --> 00:22:33,533
I think he's that guy from…

300
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,734
You know…

301
00:22:44,834 --> 00:22:46,266
It's him.

302
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,000
His name is Choi.

303
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,333
- Really?
- Yeah, it is him.

304
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,400
- Who?
- The guy from Parasite.

305
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,500
- No way.
- He is. His name is Choi.

306
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,867
- The kid?
- No.

307
00:22:58,934 --> 00:23:01,066
- The guy?
- Yeah, the guy.

308
00:23:01,133 --> 00:23:03,066
Let's ask him later.

309
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,667
For purple.

310
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:09,800
- Serving bulgogi first?
- Yes.

311
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,066
Bulgogi? Beef?

312
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,500
- Yes. Thank you.
- We're gonna share it.

313
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,800
- I have a question.
- Yes?

314
00:23:16,867 --> 00:23:18,867
- Are you an actor as well?
- Yes.

315
00:23:18,934 --> 00:23:20,000
Did you play in "Parasite"?

316
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,433
Yes.

317
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,967
- Thank you.
- I remembered.

318
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:24,834
- It was a great movie.
- Thank you.

319
00:23:24,867 --> 00:23:26,367
This sauce is really spicy.

320
00:23:26,433 --> 00:23:28,166
Yes, thank you.

321
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,100
This is crazy.

322
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:31,934
Seriously, this is crazy.

323
00:23:43,467 --> 00:23:45,166
The sauce isn't spicy.

324
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:46,266
Huh?

325
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:47,600
It's not spicy.

326
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,266
It's the best thing we've had until now.

327
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,567
Yeah.

328
00:24:05,867 --> 00:24:07,433
Tae Hyung, how's the chicken?

329
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,500
No, but it's almost done.

330
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:11,133
Give me one minute.

331
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,133
Can I serve this?

332
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,467
No, wait.

333
00:24:20,533 --> 00:24:21,600
This.

334
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,500
- For purple?
- Yes, for purple.

335
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,367
- Chicken?
- Thank you, yes.

336
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,400
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

337
00:24:39,834 --> 00:24:41,100
Let's come again.

338
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:46,166
Normally,
I'm not really into sweet sauces,

339
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:47,900
- but this is…
- It's insane.

340
00:24:47,967 --> 00:24:50,266
And the batter too.

341
00:25:03,533 --> 00:25:05,767
- Could you take out the tater dog out?
- Okay.

342
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:08,834
After one minute,
put it here to drain the oil.

343
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,700
- Then roll it on sugar.
- Okay.

344
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:11,800
Then…

345
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:13,967
- Put this here…
- Put that there.

346
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:15,467
And…

347
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:16,300
Okay.

348
00:25:22,333 --> 00:25:23,834
Now, put it here.

349
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,567
And drain the oil.

350
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:07,100
We're gonna have a break time.

351
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,667
Oh, okay.

352
00:26:10,633 --> 00:26:12,533
- We'll come back later.
- Okay.

353
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:16,200
It says we might appear in the show.

354
00:26:16,266 --> 00:26:18,700
It says, "Thank you for visiting."

355
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,633
Excuse me.

356
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,300
You have to come here to order.

357
00:26:25,367 --> 00:26:26,400
Okay.

358
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:29,200
Do you guys know what to get today?

359
00:26:30,767 --> 00:26:32,967
- Definitely this.
- What would you recommend?

360
00:26:33,033 --> 00:26:35,300
This is good. It's good chicken.

361
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,433
Hellamyeon looks really good.

362
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,066
This is really spicy.

363
00:26:42,133 --> 00:26:44,166
- But it's good.
- We'd like to get that.

364
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,533
Oh, really?

365
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,033
- I'm warning you. It's very spicy.
- Okay.

366
00:26:48,033 --> 00:26:49,867
But it's good. It's good-spicy.

367
00:26:49,934 --> 00:26:51,400
All right. And what else?

368
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:53,600
- Do you want any of these?
- Yeah.

369
00:26:53,667 --> 00:26:54,867
- The pork one.
- Gimbap…

370
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:57,133
One gimbap...

371
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,533
Spicy pork.

372
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:00,834
And tteok…

373
00:27:01,033 --> 00:27:02,166
With cheese.

374
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:04,133
Tteokbokki with cheese.

375
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:09,867
Purple.

376
00:27:09,934 --> 00:27:11,100
Purple…

377
00:27:11,166 --> 00:27:12,867
Woo Shik, serve this to purple.

378
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:14,233
- Tuna?
- Yes.

379
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:16,567
Yes, it was amazing.

380
00:27:17,567 --> 00:27:19,633
Are you sharing this as well?

381
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,567
Yeah.

382
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:22,967
Do you want scissors to cut it?

383
00:27:23,033 --> 00:27:24,934
- What?
- Or a knife?

384
00:27:25,133 --> 00:27:26,734
- That would be nice.
- For sharing?

385
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:29,633
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

386
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,800
Anything to drink?

387
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:36,200
- Three red wine.
- Three red, okay.

388
00:27:36,934 --> 00:27:39,367
That would be 800 pesos.

389
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:40,700
Okay. Do we pay now?

390
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:42,100
Yes, please.

391
00:27:42,533 --> 00:27:44,066
An order. We got an order.

392
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,266
Okay.

393
00:27:46,166 --> 00:27:48,066
- We got one more hellamyeon.
- One more?

394
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,567
And one cheese tteokbokki.

395
00:27:49,633 --> 00:27:52,000
- Should I do the cheese tteokbokki?
- Yes.

396
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:54,000
- One hellamyeon.
- For cheese tteokbokki,

397
00:27:54,033 --> 00:27:56,800
- two rice cakes, one fish cake, cheese…
- This first.

398
00:28:48,333 --> 00:28:49,333
Here you go.

399
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:55,500
You're not having this one?

400
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,100
No, I'm having the other one.

401
00:28:57,166 --> 00:29:00,166
I think mine will be pretty good.

402
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:03,800
I think it's the noodle that went viral.

403
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,500
From the challenge or whatever.

404
00:29:09,834 --> 00:29:11,266
- For you.
- Thank you.

405
00:29:11,333 --> 00:29:13,367
- It's spicy.
- Yes, thank you.

406
00:29:32,066 --> 00:29:33,834
It's not that spicy.

407
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,834
It's not?

408
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:40,000
It's just normal spicy.

409
00:29:47,767 --> 00:29:49,934
Aren't you going to drink it?

410
00:29:51,066 --> 00:29:54,066
It's the best part of the food.

411
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,567
The cheese tteokbokki.

412
00:30:18,567 --> 00:30:20,767
Whoa, it looks crazy.

413
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:22,000
Awesome.

414
00:30:22,066 --> 00:30:27,266
So if you just grab it
and cut it into little pieces…

415
00:30:27,333 --> 00:30:29,633
It's kind of long.

416
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,400
- You just cut it like…
- Wow. Cool.

417
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:40,300
Honestly, that is the craziest looking…

418
00:30:40,367 --> 00:30:42,066
What is that?

419
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,867
It looks weird.

420
00:30:45,934 --> 00:30:48,266
Oh my god, it's so odd.

421
00:30:49,166 --> 00:30:51,867
It has a very strange texture.

422
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,533
It's like gnocchi.

423
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,333
Gnocchi.

424
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,033
- Quite nice.
- Yeah.

425
00:31:00,667 --> 00:31:02,200
Cheese me.

426
00:31:02,266 --> 00:31:03,900
It's kind of spicy, you know.

427
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:06,066
That is spicy.

428
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,333
Holy… Those crispy balls are good.

429
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:28,200
- Cheese.
- Whiz, whiz.

430
00:31:28,266 --> 00:31:30,834
This is the cheese city, baby.

431
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,967
I never eat cheese
unless I'm really drunk.

432
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,266
But I'm really enjoying it.

433
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,867
I also love that we've already paid.

434
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,800
I love that we already paid.
We just need to eat the food now.

435
00:31:40,834 --> 00:31:42,433
That's street food, right?

436
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:48,467
More.

437
00:31:50,266 --> 00:31:51,700
- That looks amazing.
- Thank you.

438
00:31:51,834 --> 00:31:53,600
- This is pork.
- Amazing.

439
00:31:53,734 --> 00:31:55,266
- You're sharing this, right?
- Yeah, we're sharing.

440
00:31:57,867 --> 00:31:59,033
Thank you.

441
00:32:00,266 --> 00:32:02,900
Can I try what it tastes like?

442
00:32:02,967 --> 00:32:04,467
- Oh, my…
- Is it good?

443
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,400
Both, the sauces' flavors...

444
00:32:13,867 --> 00:32:14,967
Cool.

445
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:26,533
Holy smokes.

446
00:32:26,567 --> 00:32:28,667
- Good?
- It's crazy good.

447
00:32:30,867 --> 00:32:32,100
Oh, my God.

448
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,066
Unbelievable.

449
00:32:34,166 --> 00:32:36,033
That's the best thing I've ever had.

450
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,166
Is it?

451
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:44,300
Oh, my God. That chicken.

452
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:47,900
Good?

453
00:32:47,967 --> 00:32:49,033
Yea.

454
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:54,033
So this is Hellamyeon.

455
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:58,066
- It's really spicy.
- Thank you.

456
00:33:02,133 --> 00:33:03,500
Tell me how spicy it is.

457
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,133
Oh, my. It's hot.

458
00:33:08,233 --> 00:33:10,266
The temperature… Oh, God. It's spicy.

459
00:33:11,066 --> 00:33:13,100
Oh, my God. It's spicy.

460
00:33:13,333 --> 00:33:14,533
It's good though.

461
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,133
It's not bad.

462
00:33:28,567 --> 00:33:30,834
My nose...

463
00:33:31,233 --> 00:33:32,767
They didn't get us napkins.

464
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,367
I love that chicken.

465
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,033
- Oh, that chicken is unbelievable.
- It's silly good.

466
00:33:48,333 --> 00:33:49,834
I love that.

467
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,667
It's really good.

468
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:00,767
I don't know what it is,

469
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,633
- but it's really good.
- Wanna try it?

470
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:04,967
Try it.

471
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:13,100
It's good.

472
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:17,433
But I'm not sure what it is.

473
00:34:21,033 --> 00:34:22,600
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

474
00:34:23,166 --> 00:34:24,834
What is this?

475
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,333
It's mandu. It's a dumpling.

476
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,967
Can I order more of it?

477
00:34:29,033 --> 00:34:31,333
- Do you wanna order more?
- Yes.

478
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:35,100
This one or this one?

479
00:34:35,166 --> 00:34:37,100
Just the dumplings.

480
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:39,300
Oh, we don't have that menu separately.

481
00:34:39,367 --> 00:34:40,567
Hold on.

482
00:34:40,567 --> 00:34:41,734
Let's just give some.

483
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:43,100
- Do we have any?
- Dumplings?

484
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,667
Let's give them some extra dumplings.

485
00:34:48,734 --> 00:34:49,700
Do we have any?

486
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:51,400
Yeah, we do.

487
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:53,500
Have a seat. I'll just give you some.

488
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:55,467
Thank you.

489
00:34:55,533 --> 00:34:57,567
Is it not turned on?

490
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:05,166
I heard some popping noise earlier.

491
00:35:05,233 --> 00:35:06,800
Looking good.

492
00:35:06,867 --> 00:35:09,467
She likes dumplings,
so let's give her more.

493
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,233
It's our last dumplings.

494
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,734
Thank you.

495
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,633
It's very delicious. Thank you so much.

496
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:28,166
I'll finish the last one in two bites.

497
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,967
Delicious.

498
00:35:39,033 --> 00:35:40,133
Yeah, it's good.

499
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,834
I was starving,

500
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,533
and then I got to eat a delicious food
that I can't have more.

501
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,300
I should be thankful
that I had yummy food.

502
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:50,967
Oh, my God. The food was so great.

503
00:35:51,033 --> 00:35:53,633
- All of it.
- It was disgustingly good.

504
00:35:55,834 --> 00:35:57,567
How was it? Was it good?

505
00:35:58,567 --> 00:36:01,400
- It was amazing.
- It was really good.

506
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,433
Was the noodle too spicy?

507
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:06,200
- It was good.
- It was good.

508
00:36:06,266 --> 00:36:08,100
- You're good with spicy.
- More spice.

509
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:09,333
Oh, really?

510
00:36:10,033 --> 00:36:12,266
No, it was perfect. It was amazing.

511
00:36:12,333 --> 00:36:13,567
Where are you from?

512
00:36:13,633 --> 00:36:15,433
- England.
- England.

513
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,767
- Scotland.
- Scotland.

514
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:19,900
Your accents are very nice.

515
00:36:22,367 --> 00:36:23,500
Is everything okay?

516
00:36:23,567 --> 00:36:25,066
Everything was good. Thanks.

517
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:27,567
- Muy bien, muy bien.
- Muy bien.

518
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:29,200
Mucho guapo.

519
00:36:29,266 --> 00:36:31,133
Thank you.

520
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,867
Good for you.

521
00:36:37,233 --> 00:36:40,200
- Muchas gracias.
- Adios.

522
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:44,066
Bye, thank you.

523
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:46,900
Thank you.

524
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,233
Do we have enough ingredients?

525
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:59,100
We're almost running out
of gimbap ingredients.

526
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,200
- No ingredients? At all?
- No.

527
00:37:01,233 --> 00:37:04,934
- I can only make a couple more rolls now.
- Of each menu?

528
00:37:05,734 --> 00:37:06,667
Yes.

529
00:37:06,734 --> 00:37:09,233
We need more grated carrots and cucumbers.

530
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:15,367
No chicken?

531
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,133
We can't receive any more customers.

532
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:20,266
We just don't have enough ingredients.

533
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,633
Seo Jin, are we closed now?

534
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:30,633
Yes, we are.

535
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,700
No more customers?

536
00:37:31,767 --> 00:37:32,767
No.

537
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:46,200
I'm going back to Korea.

538
00:37:46,266 --> 00:37:48,300
This contract was a scam.

539
00:37:51,133 --> 00:37:54,133
- This feels harder than Youn's Stay.
- Right?

540
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,300
I feel the same.

541
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,834
Profits come first.

542
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:19,133
I'll just skip dinner today
and go to bed early.

543
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,000
The staff say they're so tired.

544
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:29,600
We reached the number.

545
00:38:29,667 --> 00:38:30,967
- We made it.
- What?

546
00:38:31,033 --> 00:38:31,867
The sales?

547
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,734
We made over 10,000 pesos.

548
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,200
Are you happy now?

549
00:38:38,734 --> 00:38:40,333
He got his smile back.

550
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:45,166
- I think we reached the goal too fast.
- What was that?

551
00:38:45,266 --> 00:38:47,533
We're changing the name.

552
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,533
Sir, we're changing our name.

553
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,333
It's not Jinny's Kitchen anymore.

554
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,033
It's Someone Please Stop Jinny.

555
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,367
We made over 10,000 pesos.

556
00:38:57,433 --> 00:38:58,934
What? Really?

557
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,567
Hey, you forgot to serve this
with the chicken.

558
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,867
Woo Shik.

559
00:39:04,867 --> 00:39:05,700
Woo Shik.

560
00:39:08,867 --> 00:39:10,100
Wait, sir.

561
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:13,567
You can't blame me for this.

562
00:39:13,867 --> 00:39:17,467
All the tables... Purple, black...

563
00:39:18,166 --> 00:39:21,400
In the dining area, how about…

564
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,800
- Magnets?
- Yes.

565
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,533
- Thank you very much.
- It was very delicious.

566
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:32,000
It was really good.
The chicken was amazing.

567
00:39:32,066 --> 00:39:33,166
- Really?
- Yeah.

568
00:39:33,233 --> 00:39:35,000
- Thank you for coming.
- Thanks, chef.

569
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:37,066
They said the chicken was amazing.

570
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:39,533
Your chicken was amazing.

571
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,467
Gosh...

572
00:39:46,533 --> 00:39:48,300
I can't believe they loved my food.

573
00:39:48,367 --> 00:39:50,333
The chicken powder is really good.

574
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,000
Well done, Tae Hyung.

575
00:39:53,066 --> 00:39:55,400
Without you, it would've been difficult.

576
00:39:55,467 --> 00:39:57,066
Say it would've been impossible.

577
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:58,867
Let me do it again. Turn around.

578
00:39:58,934 --> 00:40:01,333
Well done, Tae Hyung. Without you,

579
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,867
it would've been difficult.

580
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:09,433
- Thank you guys, take care.
- Thank you.

581
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:13,033
Thank you. See you, guys.

582
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,066
If we have to cook for dinner,

583
00:40:32,133 --> 00:40:33,333
I'll just skip dinner.

584
00:40:34,133 --> 00:40:36,700
- Me too.
- I'll just skip it.

585
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:38,700
I'm not eating anything.

586
00:40:38,834 --> 00:40:40,533
Are you sure? What about ramyeon?

587
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:41,834
No.

588
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,834
No?

589
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:57,200
I've always had a business mindset.

590
00:40:57,266 --> 00:41:00,066
A day off during seven days?
Are you kidding?

591
00:41:01,533 --> 00:41:02,867
Come on.

592
00:41:02,934 --> 00:41:06,033
It's kind of a shame
that we won't have any days off.

593
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:09,066
It's a short schedule.

594
00:41:11,233 --> 00:41:15,367
Don't you think
this policy could be criticized?

595
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:17,000
Let them criticize it.

596
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:21,033
I don't mind criticism.

597
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,934
Let's take a day off tomorrow.

598
00:41:32,934 --> 00:41:36,367
You can watch soccer
in the evening and go kayaking.

599
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:42,800
If we're closed tomorrow,

600
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,300
do we have to prep from scratch
the day after?

601
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:46,500
- Yes.
- Yes.

602
00:41:46,567 --> 00:41:48,367
- We should.
- We should.

603
00:41:48,433 --> 00:41:51,300
Then we should come to work early
after our day off.

604
00:41:53,633 --> 00:41:54,934
Let's go home.

605
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,166
Shall we?

606
00:41:56,233 --> 00:41:57,266
Guys, let's go.

607
00:41:58,667 --> 00:42:00,100
Woo Shik, sit in the front.

608
00:42:00,133 --> 00:42:01,533
No, I'll sit in the back.

609
00:42:02,033 --> 00:42:03,834
Sit in the front, Seo Jun.

610
00:42:12,333 --> 00:42:14,100
Why am I so tired?

611
00:42:14,166 --> 00:42:16,200
I wish someone tread on my back.

612
00:42:16,266 --> 00:42:17,633
I can do it for you.

613
00:42:22,767 --> 00:42:24,900
Wow, we're so quiet.

614
00:42:25,333 --> 00:42:27,166
Let's all say "We can do it."

615
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,567
- We can do it.
- We can do it.

616
00:42:29,467 --> 00:42:30,367
We can do it.

617
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,767
You should say it too.

618
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:33,967
It's your restaurant.

619
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,700
- What?
- It's your restaurant.

620
00:42:36,767 --> 00:42:38,400
- What?
- Say "We can do it."

621
00:42:38,533 --> 00:42:39,667
It's closed now.

622
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:41,400
By the way, our goal today--

623
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,233
Hey, a mosquito.

624
00:42:43,233 --> 00:42:45,166
- I caught it.
- He caught it.

625
00:42:45,233 --> 00:42:48,600
I killed you.

626
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,734
What should I do now?

627
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,066
Just shake it off.

628
00:42:58,767 --> 00:43:01,633
Woo Shik...

629
00:43:03,467 --> 00:43:04,967
Is there butter?

630
00:43:05,033 --> 00:43:06,166
Did you salt them?

631
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,734
No, I didn't.

632
00:43:07,734 --> 00:43:09,433
What about cheese?

633
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:11,800
Oh, with cheese

634
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:13,900
- and butter, it'll be good.
- I don't want it.

635
00:43:13,967 --> 00:43:15,800
I don't wanna.

636
00:43:17,100 --> 00:43:19,867
Your scorched rice soup is here.

637
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:22,133
Yu Mi, do you want soup?

638
00:43:35,867 --> 00:43:37,467
The potatoes are ridiculous.

639
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,333
Did you buy it to make this?

640
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:44,500
No.

641
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,200
- All right. Good night, everyone.
- Good night.

642
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,400
What are you eating?

643
00:45:16,467 --> 00:45:17,867
Cheese balls.

644
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,166
If…

645
00:45:20,233 --> 00:45:25,100
Your loved one turned into a zombie.
What are you gonna do?

646
00:45:25,166 --> 00:45:28,600
My loved one turned into a zombie?

647
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:30,233
Will you let her bite you
and become a zombie

648
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,500
or kill her?

649
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:39,367
Being a zombie or killing her…

650
00:45:43,233 --> 00:45:45,967
She's your wife.

651
00:45:46,033 --> 00:45:47,734
I'll become a zombie.

652
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:49,166
But you have a daughter.

653
00:45:49,233 --> 00:45:50,400
I have a daughter?

654
00:45:52,567 --> 00:45:53,834
I have to kill her then.

655
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:04,433
- What if your daughter's the zombie?
- She's a zombie?

656
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,066
You only have just enough food
to survive a week.

657
00:46:07,133 --> 00:46:08,600
And your wife is fine.

658
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,033
She has a big appetite though.

659
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,467
We'll all die together.

660
00:46:20,467 --> 00:46:22,567
What if you're a zombie?

661
00:46:22,633 --> 00:46:26,000
Your wife is fine.

662
00:46:26,066 --> 00:46:27,333
I'm a zombie.

663
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:29,433
And my wife is fine. And?

664
00:46:30,734 --> 00:46:32,400
Will you bite your wife?

665
00:47:57,133 --> 00:47:59,300
Let's go. Let's exercise.

666
00:48:26,166 --> 00:48:27,834
Let's do two more sets.

667
00:48:27,900 --> 00:48:29,767
- Two more sets?
- Yes.

668
00:48:30,367 --> 00:48:31,867
- I'm leaving now.
- Huh?

669
00:48:31,934 --> 00:48:33,900
- I'm leaving now.
- Don't go.

670
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:35,400
Bye!

671
00:48:35,467 --> 00:48:37,967
- Where are you going?
- I'll go kayaking.

672
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,400
Let me just…

673
00:49:18,166 --> 00:49:19,433
Nice, cool bro.

674
00:49:19,734 --> 00:49:21,400
- Woo Shik.
- Woo Shik? I'm Ols.

675
00:49:21,467 --> 00:49:24,033
Ols? Nice to meet you.

676
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:26,333
You're welcome, bro.

677
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:40,800
It's uphill. I'm so tired.

678
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:44,300
Wait, one, two, three.

679
00:49:44,767 --> 00:49:46,800
I like my driver.

680
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,400
Ayo!

681
00:49:50,934 --> 00:49:52,767
Here comes a bump.

682
00:49:54,133 --> 00:49:56,367
Oh, boy.

683
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,667
Hola!

684
00:50:03,533 --> 00:50:05,600
It's right here.

685
00:50:08,834 --> 00:50:10,500
Where does this bridge end?

686
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,066
It seems endless.

687
00:50:17,233 --> 00:50:19,166
Let's sit here for a while. I'm tired.

688
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,367
So tired.

689
00:50:30,633 --> 00:50:32,967
We should come here after work.

690
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:35,000
- After work?
- Yeah.

691
00:50:35,667 --> 00:50:37,533
I wanna go into the water.

692
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:38,633
Let's go.

693
00:50:39,734 --> 00:50:42,333
This place is like a swimming pool.

694
00:50:45,367 --> 00:50:47,834
Where should we sit? Over there?

695
00:53:46,567 --> 00:53:48,333
You'll stay, right?

696
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:02,166
Can I order some pizza to go?

697
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:06,734
I'm going to pick up at the...

698
00:54:13,367 --> 00:54:15,166
Let's go!

699
00:54:15,934 --> 00:54:19,400
We got this! Korea!

700
00:54:23,734 --> 00:54:25,800
- This looks good.
- Sonny, Sonny!

701
00:54:25,867 --> 00:54:27,834
Let's dig in.

702
00:54:30,667 --> 00:54:32,500
It's really good.

703
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:36,800
- No.
- Another goal.

704
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,166
We still have lots of time.

705
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,400
- Did you see the pass?
- That was crazy.

706
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,500
What? What happened?

707
00:55:02,867 --> 00:55:04,100
That was a nice one.

708
00:55:04,166 --> 00:55:06,300
That was so cool.

709
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:09,133
- It was Paik Seung Ho.
- He made a goal.

710
00:55:12,367 --> 00:55:14,200
Time flies.

711
00:55:14,834 --> 00:55:16,233
I love you.

712
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,066
Enjoy.

713
00:55:21,533 --> 00:55:22,633
The lime!

714
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,700
Time really flew by.

715
00:55:24,767 --> 00:55:26,133
We need to work now.

716
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,100
Now, all we have left to do is work.

717
00:55:28,166 --> 00:55:30,333
So we open at 2 PM and close at what time?

718
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,433
I'm thinking 7 PM?

719
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,333
It's mine.

720
00:55:38,533 --> 00:55:39,867
Dad!

721
00:55:43,166 --> 00:55:44,100
Hello?

722
00:55:44,166 --> 00:55:48,834
Gee, we agreed to not pick up the phone
when we're together.

723
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,900
Can't you keep your work life separate?

724
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,767
I hate him when he's like this.

725
00:55:56,834 --> 00:55:58,700
Yes, I'm in Mexico.

726
00:55:59,266 --> 00:56:01,667
Seriously?
We're in Mexico, for God's sake.

727
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:03,934
Come on…

728
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:10,567
Do we have break time tomorrow too?

729
00:56:10,633 --> 00:56:12,367
Tomorrow? Yes.

730
00:56:12,433 --> 00:56:14,900
I think we'll have to.

731
00:56:15,767 --> 00:56:17,500
I don't think we'll be busy.

732
00:56:17,533 --> 00:56:20,467
What if we buy 4kg of chicken
and nobody comes?

733
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,233
That won't happen.

734
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:24,800
You'll see.

735
00:56:24,867 --> 00:56:26,467
It could be like yesterday.

736
00:56:26,867 --> 00:56:28,500
We can use that ongoing.

737
00:56:30,467 --> 00:56:33,133
How much was 4kg of chicken?

738
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,900
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Seo Jin.

739
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,967
Should we open a little late today?

740
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:13,967
What are you talking about?

741
00:57:15,033 --> 00:57:18,033
- In case the chicken prep takes long.
- Then hurry.

742
00:57:20,633 --> 00:57:22,867
Any day if we make over 7,500 pesos,

743
00:57:22,934 --> 00:57:25,900
it's a successful day.

744
00:57:28,433 --> 00:57:30,166
Are you ready? Let's go.

745
00:57:30,233 --> 00:57:33,033
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

746
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:35,467
- One, two, three. Let's go!
- Let's go!

747
00:57:41,767 --> 00:57:43,567
Good morning.

748
00:58:03,033 --> 00:58:05,633
Today, I see
quite many people walking around.

749
00:58:16,834 --> 00:58:20,200
Today's gonna be another fun day.

750
00:58:25,133 --> 00:58:27,166
- We're here.
- We arrived.

751
00:58:27,233 --> 00:58:28,734
See you after the shopping.

752
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:29,834
Good luck.

753
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:42,567
Rice, beef…

754
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,800
- Tuna mayo.
- Cut the fried tofu too.

755
00:58:44,834 --> 00:58:47,033
We should make the sauces too.
Both of them.

756
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:48,100
Okay.

757
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:57,500
We're out of everything.

758
00:59:02,166 --> 00:59:03,800
All right. Three, two, one.

759
00:59:03,867 --> 00:59:05,367
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

760
00:59:05,433 --> 00:59:06,533
First, rice.

761
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,834
All right, all right.

762
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:10,266
So we need 2kg of chicken thighs
and 2kg of chicken breast?

763
01:00:10,333 --> 01:00:11,333
Yes.

764
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:14,867
- Oh, Ingrid isn't here.
- Oh?

765
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,800
Where's Ingrid?

766
01:00:16,867 --> 01:00:18,367
She's not here right now.

767
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:21,100
This is bad.

768
01:00:23,367 --> 01:00:24,667
The breast...

769
01:00:24,967 --> 01:00:26,667
- You need chicken breast.
- Yes.

770
01:00:27,533 --> 01:00:30,100
Without bone, please.

771
01:00:30,533 --> 01:00:32,233
- Was it 2kg?
- Yes, 2kg.

772
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,967
Apples?

773
01:00:42,433 --> 01:00:43,900
Three.

774
01:01:06,767 --> 01:01:07,800
Thank you.

775
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:09,900
Thank you very much.

776
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:19,166
I saw people queuing
for that food yesterday.

777
01:01:19,867 --> 01:01:20,834
What is it?

778
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:22,900
I don't know. Some street food.

779
01:01:53,734 --> 01:01:54,734
Hola.

780
01:01:57,400 --> 01:01:59,433
- Hola.
- Hola.

781
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:02,266
- Hey, you're back.
- Yeah.

782
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,734
I should start with the chicken prep.

783
01:02:26,433 --> 01:02:29,433
This is going well. No mistakes so far.

784
01:02:40,667 --> 01:02:42,567
You're like a human salad spinner.

785
01:02:44,867 --> 01:02:46,567
Like Music Bank.

786
01:02:59,834 --> 01:03:01,233
Come on. Do it.

787
01:03:31,133 --> 01:03:32,300
Seo Jun.

788
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:35,166
Seo Jun.

789
01:03:37,333 --> 01:03:39,967
Seo Jun, would you like to check
the chicken?

790
01:03:43,266 --> 01:03:44,567
Looks good.

791
01:03:44,633 --> 01:03:46,266
- Is it hot?
- No.

792
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:47,667
Oh, got it.

793
01:03:52,533 --> 01:03:53,834
How does the chicken look?

794
01:03:56,633 --> 01:03:58,567
- The color seems all right to me.
- Okay.

795
01:03:59,467 --> 01:04:02,633
Wow, your arms look amazing.

796
01:04:09,033 --> 01:04:11,500
Do we have the chicken sauce?

797
01:04:11,567 --> 01:04:12,633
We need to make it.

798
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,567
I'll make it.

799
01:04:14,633 --> 01:04:16,533
I'm good at it.

800
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,834
- I'll take the scale.
- Okay.

801
01:04:37,300 --> 01:04:39,767
Man, did you hear the sizzle?

802
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:56,900
It juices so well.

803
01:04:57,533 --> 01:04:59,200
Look. It's making juice.

804
01:05:36,967 --> 01:05:38,734
Seo Jun, should we make any samples?

805
01:05:38,800 --> 01:05:40,033
- Samples?
- Yes.

806
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:43,100
- We need to make a sample chicken.
- Chicken and…

807
01:05:43,166 --> 01:05:46,200
Whatever it is,
start making the sample food.

808
01:06:03,633 --> 01:06:04,900
Chicken?

809
01:06:37,834 --> 01:06:39,633
- Is the kitchen ready?
- Yes.

810
01:06:54,667 --> 01:06:56,934
Are we ready now?
I'll open the restaurant.

811
01:06:57,166 --> 01:06:59,367
- Yes.
- Tae Hyung, let's open.

812
01:06:59,433 --> 01:07:00,533
Okay.

813
01:07:15,166 --> 01:07:16,567
Seo Jun.

814
01:07:16,633 --> 01:07:17,867
You look gorgeous today.

815
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:19,433
No, you're gorgeous.

816
01:07:28,066 --> 01:07:29,133
Hola.

817
01:07:30,367 --> 01:07:32,200
- How many?
- Two.

818
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:36,767
Oh, my.

819
01:07:36,834 --> 01:07:39,667
I wanna try them all. That's the problem.

820
01:07:39,734 --> 01:07:41,133
Then how about this?

821
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:42,367
We order one gimbap

822
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:44,300
and one more thing you want.

823
01:07:44,367 --> 01:07:45,633
- Beef.
- Beef?

824
01:07:45,700 --> 01:07:46,266
Yes, please.

825
01:07:46,333 --> 01:07:47,934
I want to have ramyeon.

826
01:07:48,467 --> 01:07:51,266
- One original?
- Yes and pineapple juice.

827
01:07:51,834 --> 01:07:54,400
Okay, it's freshly squeezed.
One pineapple juice?

828
01:07:56,233 --> 01:08:00,533
- Coke for me in a glass of ice.
- Okay.

829
01:08:01,734 --> 01:08:04,166
Take this to your table,
I'll bring food to you.

830
01:08:04,233 --> 01:08:05,233
Hey.

831
01:08:05,967 --> 01:08:07,033
Let's do this.

832
01:08:07,433 --> 01:08:08,734
Let's do this today.

833
01:08:08,767 --> 01:08:10,233
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

834
01:08:11,200 --> 01:08:12,767
Original ramyeon?

835
01:08:12,834 --> 01:08:13,567
Yes.

836
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:15,433
We got one pineapple juice.

837
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:17,467
How do we serve it?

838
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,633
- Just pour it.
- How much?

839
01:08:19,700 --> 01:08:20,533
Like this.

840
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,066
Pineapple juice.

841
01:08:28,266 --> 01:08:29,567
Thank you.

842
01:08:29,800 --> 01:08:32,066
And your one coke.

843
01:08:32,133 --> 01:08:33,200
Thank you.

844
01:08:33,767 --> 01:08:35,266
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

845
01:08:40,567 --> 01:08:43,367
It's fresh juice.
I thought it'd be a bottled one.

846
01:08:43,433 --> 01:08:44,600
It's really good.

847
01:08:50,266 --> 01:08:51,667
Which one should I use?

848
01:08:53,800 --> 01:08:55,133
This one should do.

849
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:02,033
Today, I boiled it in advance.

850
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,166
Woo Shik, this one too.

851
01:09:10,967 --> 01:09:13,667
- You're done already?
- I started rolling early.

852
01:09:13,734 --> 01:09:14,467
Good job.

853
01:09:15,433 --> 01:09:18,734
Beef, veggie, tuna, pork.

854
01:09:42,467 --> 01:09:43,800
One bulgogi.

855
01:09:44,934 --> 01:09:45,934
It's done.

856
01:09:47,166 --> 01:09:48,934
Serve it with ramyeon.

857
01:09:48,934 --> 01:09:49,900
Okay.

858
01:09:49,934 --> 01:09:51,867
- Well done.
- I'll put it here.

859
01:10:01,367 --> 01:10:02,667
Thank you.

860
01:10:02,734 --> 01:10:05,700
- We can try it together.
- Gimbap.

861
01:10:05,767 --> 01:10:08,033
This is the sauce.

862
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:11,767
- Gimbap.
- Thank you.

863
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:15,533
Oh, my gosh.

864
01:10:16,133 --> 01:10:21,500
It looks nice. I like the details.

865
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:29,700
Is it good?

866
01:10:31,633 --> 01:10:32,767
It's really good.

867
01:10:33,500 --> 01:10:35,200
Let me try a bite too.

868
01:10:39,967 --> 01:10:42,300
I like that the roll isn't too big.

869
01:10:42,367 --> 01:10:43,800
Because it'll be hard to eat.

870
01:10:44,433 --> 01:10:45,633
Dip it in the sauce.

871
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:46,867
Isn't it too spicy?

872
01:10:46,934 --> 01:10:48,066
- No.
- No?

873
01:10:48,133 --> 01:10:53,166
Well, not for me, a Mexican.

874
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,300
- Spicy or not spicy?
- Not spicy.

875
01:10:59,433 --> 01:11:00,667
So…

876
01:11:01,867 --> 01:11:03,567
Maybe a bit? It's a bit sweet too.

877
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:06,433
I've never seen eggs in a soup.

878
01:11:08,066 --> 01:11:09,233
This will make me happy.

879
01:11:09,233 --> 01:11:13,767
It's sweet and spicy.
I can taste the sweetness.

880
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:16,533
It doesn't taste sweet to me.

881
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,367
To me, it tasted sweet.

882
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:20,934
It's good.

883
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:54,667
I'll do it when I'm not busy.

884
01:11:54,700 --> 01:11:56,500
Thanks. It shouldn't get scorched.

885
01:12:07,500 --> 01:12:08,967
Hola.

886
01:12:17,600 --> 01:12:18,834
The menu is here.

887
01:12:19,767 --> 01:12:20,800
Menu?

888
01:12:30,667 --> 01:12:32,967
I like your hat.

889
01:12:33,567 --> 01:12:35,233
New England Patriots.

890
01:12:35,300 --> 01:12:36,333
Thank you.

891
01:12:38,900 --> 01:12:39,900
It's very spicy.

892
01:12:39,967 --> 01:12:41,433
It's very spicy.

893
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:42,567
Diablo.

894
01:12:43,834 --> 01:12:45,200
Oh, okay.

895
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,633
One?

896
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:53,734
- One.
- One original corn dog?

897
01:12:55,033 --> 01:12:57,200
Three? Okay.

898
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,934
- Yes!
- We got an order.

899
01:12:59,967 --> 01:13:00,967
Okay.

900
01:13:02,300 --> 01:13:04,734
Two chicken and one original corn dog.

901
01:13:32,633 --> 01:13:34,767
This is like Tetris.

902
01:13:39,967 --> 01:13:42,433
Hot dog?

903
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:43,567
Thank you.

904
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:50,967
- Thank you.
- That's me.

905
01:13:52,433 --> 01:13:53,533
Thank you.

906
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:00,266
Is it good? Really?

907
01:14:00,433 --> 01:14:01,900
It's so good.

908
01:14:05,567 --> 01:14:06,867
I think it's really good.

909
01:14:07,633 --> 01:14:08,734
It's good, isn't it?

910
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:10,900
It's so good.

911
01:14:10,967 --> 01:14:12,400
You can try mine too.

912
01:14:18,467 --> 01:14:20,200
Is it chicken?

913
01:14:20,266 --> 01:14:21,467
Try it.

914
01:14:21,533 --> 01:14:22,600
No.

915
01:14:22,667 --> 01:14:25,900
- Why not?
- Try it. It's really good.

916
01:14:25,967 --> 01:14:26,967
All right.

917
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,100
I'll take the smallest.

918
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:31,667
A small one? There's a small piece.

919
01:14:39,166 --> 01:14:40,667
It's really good, right?

920
01:14:40,734 --> 01:14:43,734
Yeah, but it's a little spicy.

921
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:45,300
It's not that spicy.

922
01:14:45,367 --> 01:14:46,934
He doesn't eat spicy.

923
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,300
I do eat spicy.

924
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:51,066
- If it's too spicy, don't eat it.
- But this is a bit spicy.

925
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,533
You don't know me.

926
01:14:56,834 --> 01:14:58,467
Are they enjoying their food?

927
01:15:02,734 --> 01:15:03,800
Is everything okay?

928
01:15:03,867 --> 01:15:04,934
Yes.

929
01:15:05,000 --> 01:15:06,266
Very good.

930
01:15:07,900 --> 01:15:09,033
Is everything okay?

931
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:06,200
Tae Hyung, rest while you can.

932
01:16:06,266 --> 01:16:07,266
Okay.

933
01:16:07,367 --> 01:16:09,467
Later, we might be too busy to speak.

934
01:16:25,367 --> 01:16:26,667
Why is no one coming?

935
01:16:27,967 --> 01:16:29,734
I know it's a weekday, but still.

936
01:16:31,633 --> 01:16:33,400
This is driving me crazy.

937
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:35,834
Why did they fry so much?

938
01:16:40,233 --> 01:16:42,166
I shouldn't have fried the chicken.

939
01:16:42,800 --> 01:16:44,066
Why did you fry so many?

940
01:16:46,233 --> 01:16:47,633
Why did you fry so many?

941
01:16:47,700 --> 01:16:49,033
I had nothing to do, so…

942
01:16:50,266 --> 01:16:51,133
Chicken?

943
01:16:51,200 --> 01:16:52,367
Why did you?

944
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,667
It isn't much, once we start selling it.

945
01:16:54,734 --> 01:16:56,166
We have no customers today.

946
01:16:56,233 --> 01:16:57,967
No, we'll have customers later.

947
01:16:58,033 --> 01:17:00,133
Don't say we don't have customers.

948
01:17:01,433 --> 01:17:03,867
He told us to prepare lots yesterday

949
01:17:03,867 --> 01:17:05,867
because we're gonna be really busy.

950
01:17:05,934 --> 01:17:07,667
And now he's nagging us for that.

951
01:17:16,133 --> 01:17:17,867
- What is it?
- We can do it.

952
01:17:18,266 --> 01:17:19,900
Do what? There are no customers.

953
01:17:19,900 --> 01:17:21,333
Cheer up. Stop being cranky.

954
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:23,433
It just makes no sense. There's no one.

955
01:17:25,567 --> 01:17:27,934
Should we just go home early?

956
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:29,567
What are you talking about?

957
01:17:31,333 --> 01:17:33,834
And tteokbokki is cooked
really nicely today.

958
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:39,300
It looks really delicious today.

959
01:17:39,367 --> 01:17:41,066
Do you wanna try one?

960
01:17:43,667 --> 01:17:45,100
How are we gonna pay rent?

961
01:17:45,700 --> 01:17:47,333
Business can be slow sometimes.

962
01:18:10,867 --> 01:18:11,834
- Hola.
- Hello.

963
01:18:11,900 --> 01:18:13,467
- How are you?
- How are you?

964
01:18:14,033 --> 01:18:16,066
Good to see you again.

965
01:18:19,867 --> 01:18:21,734
- Bye.
- Thank you.

966
01:18:23,633 --> 01:18:26,367
To-go? Which one?

967
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:28,433
Tofu...

968
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:31,533
We'll get this.

969
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:34,433
- Beef?
- Yes.

970
01:18:34,633 --> 01:18:36,333
- To-go?
- Yes.

971
01:18:36,467 --> 01:18:38,066
So just one beef gimbap.

972
01:18:38,133 --> 01:18:39,133
Yes, just one.

973
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:41,567
- Only one.
- Okay.

974
01:18:44,266 --> 01:18:46,200
One more bulgogi.

975
01:18:46,233 --> 01:18:48,300
What's the most famous dish?

976
01:18:48,767 --> 01:18:50,867
- Chicken?
- Yes, chicken is famous.

977
01:18:50,934 --> 01:18:53,967
A lot of people like gimbap as well.

978
01:18:54,467 --> 01:18:56,567
- Is that the chicken?
- Yup.

979
01:18:56,633 --> 01:18:58,533
Is it the same portion?

980
01:18:58,533 --> 01:19:01,700
As for the chicken,
I think you'll get more than this.

981
01:19:01,767 --> 01:19:03,400
Does it come with rice?

982
01:19:03,467 --> 01:19:05,066
Just the chicken.

983
01:19:05,433 --> 01:19:06,834
I'll have this one.

984
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,300
- I'll have a coke.
- Okay.

985
01:19:09,367 --> 01:19:11,700
- What did he...
- One coke, one chicken.

986
01:19:14,867 --> 01:19:16,567
- It was very good.
- Thank you.

987
01:19:16,633 --> 01:19:20,433
You said you went to the gym today,
so you wouldn't eat anymore,

988
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:22,533
and you just gobbled up the food.

989
01:19:22,600 --> 01:19:24,600
It's just some salad stuff.

990
01:19:24,667 --> 01:19:26,767
Well, we didn't eat that much food anyway.

991
01:19:26,834 --> 01:19:27,967
No, we didn't.

992
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,433
Gracias.

993
01:20:10,467 --> 01:20:12,033
Here you go.

994
01:20:15,967 --> 01:20:17,233
- Hi.
- Hi.

995
01:20:18,467 --> 01:20:19,734
Thank you.

996
01:20:20,767 --> 01:20:23,033
- Have a nice day.
- Thank you.

997
01:20:23,700 --> 01:20:26,367
What did you write?

998
01:20:26,700 --> 01:20:29,133
Thanks for joining Bacalar.

999
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:37,100
An order. We got an order.

1000
01:20:37,667 --> 01:20:38,567
Here, Tae Hyung.

1001
01:20:38,633 --> 01:20:41,667
- One more chicken
- I'll do one.

1002
01:20:47,500 --> 01:20:50,000
Using this skill,
I can mix them more easily.

1003
01:21:01,233 --> 01:21:02,533
Here you go.

1004
01:21:06,333 --> 01:21:08,433
This is for you.

1005
01:21:08,500 --> 01:21:09,567
Thank you.

1006
01:21:33,266 --> 01:21:35,667
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1007
01:21:54,967 --> 01:21:56,567
- Is it break time?
- Let's go!

1008
01:23:14,834 --> 01:23:16,433
Gracias.

1009
01:23:41,934 --> 01:23:43,934
You never get to see nature here, right?

1010
01:23:44,867 --> 01:23:45,867
Nature?

1011
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:48,066
I see nature very often. Look.

1012
01:23:48,133 --> 01:23:49,333
I see nature often.

1013
01:23:51,033 --> 01:23:52,166
You're right.

1014
01:23:53,133 --> 01:23:54,700
I see this a lot.

1015
01:23:57,333 --> 01:23:58,300
How much was it?

1016
01:23:58,367 --> 01:23:59,433
How much was it?

1017
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:01,834
It was 1,175 pesos.

1018
01:24:16,667 --> 01:24:17,967
Is it similar to ours?

1019
01:24:36,533 --> 01:24:37,533
Is it good?

1020
01:24:38,066 --> 01:24:39,000
It's all right.

1021
01:24:40,734 --> 01:24:42,467
This is not going well.

1022
01:24:42,967 --> 01:24:44,066
It's not going well?

1023
01:24:50,934 --> 01:24:53,200
How's the business going?

1024
01:24:53,266 --> 01:24:54,400
- Today?
- Yes.

1025
01:24:55,033 --> 01:24:56,233
Not good.

1026
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:06,600
Woo Shik.

1027
01:25:09,467 --> 01:25:10,800
Wanna distribute flyers?

1028
01:25:14,333 --> 01:25:15,266
Huh?

1029
01:25:17,767 --> 01:25:18,900
You don't wanna do it?

1030
01:25:22,066 --> 01:25:24,033
Did you just say you don't want to?

1031
01:25:24,100 --> 01:25:25,467
You didn't, did you?

1032
01:25:25,533 --> 01:25:26,734
Say that again.

1033
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:30,400
Woo Shik.

1034
01:25:32,433 --> 01:25:34,166
He's choking.

1035
01:25:47,834 --> 01:25:48,800
Perro.

1036
01:26:00,300 --> 01:26:01,900
Hey, walk faster.

1037
01:26:19,266 --> 01:26:21,734
Maybe I'll go there today.

1038
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:35,233
Uh…

1039
01:26:41,433 --> 01:26:42,533
Hello.

1040
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:43,934
Hi.

1041
01:26:44,567 --> 01:26:45,967
Hello.

1042
01:26:47,333 --> 01:26:49,367
Hello.

1043
01:26:50,033 --> 01:26:52,667
- Do you speak English?
- Yeah.

1044
01:26:52,734 --> 01:26:55,100
Do you guys wanna come to our restaurant?

1045
01:26:55,166 --> 01:26:57,166
Okay. We can have a look.

1046
01:26:57,667 --> 01:26:59,767
It's right there.

1047
01:27:00,600 --> 01:27:02,367
It's Korean cuisine.

1048
01:27:02,834 --> 01:27:04,433
- Thank you.
- Yup.

1049
01:27:12,734 --> 01:27:15,200
Hello. Hola. Hi.

1050
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,767
English? Yeah?

1051
01:27:17,834 --> 01:27:19,767
- Wanna come to our restaurant?
- Okay.

1052
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:21,533
It's right there.

1053
01:27:21,533 --> 01:27:23,033
Do you wanna come to our restaurant?

1054
01:27:24,834 --> 01:27:26,233
Thank you. Oh, that's two.

1055
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:27,367
Hola.

1056
01:27:28,533 --> 01:27:29,500
Hi!

1057
01:27:31,967 --> 01:27:33,667
Come to our restaurant later.

1058
01:27:34,734 --> 01:27:36,033
WHAT?

1059
01:27:36,100 --> 01:27:38,033
All right.

1060
01:27:40,967 --> 01:27:42,734
There aren't many people here too.

1061
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:56,967
No people?

1062
01:27:57,033 --> 01:27:58,200
No people.

1063
01:27:58,266 --> 01:27:59,633
There were no people?

1064
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:02,900
Not many people were out there.

1065
01:28:03,934 --> 01:28:07,734
Today, even the public pier is

1066
01:28:07,800 --> 01:28:09,033
- almost empty.
- Yea?

1067
01:28:41,033 --> 01:28:41,767
Stop here?

1068
01:28:41,800 --> 01:28:43,800
- It has to stop here.
- Okay.

1069
01:28:43,834 --> 01:28:45,633
Loser makes the next order alone?

1070
01:28:45,700 --> 01:28:47,200
Okay. Rock-paper-scissors.

1071
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:48,834
You go first.

1072
01:28:49,533 --> 01:28:50,533
I'm right-handed.

1073
01:29:01,233 --> 01:29:02,467
I won.

1074
01:29:19,000 --> 01:29:20,200
No blowing.

1075
01:29:22,567 --> 01:29:23,900
Bye.

1076
01:29:23,967 --> 01:29:25,800
- Do you need the ramyeon recipe?
- No.

1077
01:29:25,867 --> 01:29:28,000
- No, it's 1:1.
- Okay.

1078
01:29:46,166 --> 01:29:47,333
Nice.

1079
01:29:59,266 --> 01:30:00,967
You do all the cooking.

1080
01:30:11,700 --> 01:30:13,133
How do you expect today's business?

1081
01:30:14,567 --> 01:30:15,967
Isn't it obvious?

1082
01:30:16,033 --> 01:30:17,433
We're doomed.

1083
01:30:20,166 --> 01:30:21,100
This is annoying.

1084
01:30:22,967 --> 01:30:24,433
Where are all the people?

1085
01:30:24,867 --> 01:30:28,266
We even went out to distribute flyers,
but there were no people.

1086
01:30:28,333 --> 01:30:29,900
Maybe it's the weather.

1087
01:30:29,967 --> 01:30:31,767
The weather is great today.

1088
01:30:31,834 --> 01:30:33,900
It's a little windy and rainy.

1089
01:30:35,100 --> 01:30:39,400
Well, two days ago, it was pouring.

1090
01:30:39,467 --> 01:30:41,800
We had a rainstorm then.

1091
01:30:41,967 --> 01:30:43,700
What are we doing here?

1092
01:30:45,567 --> 01:30:46,867
This is serious.

1093
01:30:47,867 --> 01:30:50,500
This is a losing business.

1094
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,734
Why did they prep so many ingredients?

1095
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,633
You told them to.

1096
01:30:56,667 --> 01:30:58,600
I told them to prep a lot?

1097
01:30:58,667 --> 01:31:00,066
I told them to prep.

1098
01:31:00,133 --> 01:31:02,500
I didn't tell them to cook ahead.

1099
01:31:03,333 --> 01:31:05,066
You said they love Korean food.

1100
01:31:05,633 --> 01:31:07,400
Love, my foot.

1101
01:31:08,467 --> 01:31:10,233
Why did they fry so many chickens?

1102
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:12,834
We should have that for dinner today.

1103
01:31:12,900 --> 01:31:14,400
We're all having chicken.

1104
01:31:15,433 --> 01:31:16,467
I'm skipping dinner.

1105
01:31:16,533 --> 01:31:18,934
No, you can't. We must finish them all.

1106
01:31:19,633 --> 01:31:20,734
The tteokbokki and all…

1107
01:31:20,734 --> 01:31:22,867
I'm not eating tteokbokki.

1108
01:31:26,467 --> 01:31:28,233
Why so many laver rolls?

1109
01:31:29,266 --> 01:31:32,100
This tray is full of laver rolls.

1110
01:31:32,166 --> 01:31:34,333
Good Lord.

1111
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:37,533
Should we open early tomorrow?

1112
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:39,767
What do you say?

1113
01:31:39,834 --> 01:31:42,667
Like it's gonna drag more customers.

1114
01:31:43,333 --> 01:31:46,467
No one came while we were prepping today.

1115
01:31:51,533 --> 01:31:53,633
Me too. Right?

1116
01:31:53,867 --> 01:31:55,300
Tomorrow, we'll be busy.

1117
01:31:55,300 --> 01:31:57,300
We're gonna be busy soon.

1118
01:31:57,367 --> 01:31:59,633
No, we will not.

1119
01:31:59,700 --> 01:32:01,900
There's no one on the street.

1120
01:32:01,967 --> 01:32:04,100
We didn't sell much juice today.

1121
01:32:04,166 --> 01:32:05,800
- Juice?
- We sold only two.

1122
01:32:05,867 --> 01:32:07,166
- Three.
- Three.

1123
01:32:07,233 --> 01:32:10,166
But I had four.

1124
01:32:10,233 --> 01:32:11,467
I know, so…

1125
01:32:11,533 --> 01:32:13,266
- What?
- Get some juice orders.

1126
01:32:13,367 --> 01:32:14,667
You drank our juice?

1127
01:32:14,734 --> 01:32:16,934
Yes, I drank a lot of juice.

1128
01:32:20,734 --> 01:32:23,000
- I was so thirsty.
- Good job.

1129
01:32:23,867 --> 01:32:25,166
I was really thirsty,

1130
01:32:26,333 --> 01:32:28,600
so I had four glasses of juice.

1131
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:34,500
We're having laver rolls for dinner.

1132
01:32:36,266 --> 01:32:37,834
- Who said that?
- Seo Jin.

1133
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:41,400
Fried chicken and laver rolls.

1134
01:32:41,467 --> 01:32:42,934
- Sir.
- Yes?

1135
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,734
Laver rolls for dinner?

1136
01:32:46,300 --> 01:32:50,266
Tteokbokki, laver rolls, chicken…

1137
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:54,667
What do we do with the chicken?
This is driving me crazy.

1138
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:02,567
I think we should send them
to the market tomorrow early.

1139
01:33:02,633 --> 01:33:05,633
Go buy the chickens and fry them.

1140
01:33:05,700 --> 01:33:08,533
Something like a Hawaiian shirt?

1141
01:33:13,033 --> 01:33:15,867
Very good.

1142
01:33:15,934 --> 01:33:18,233
Just do what you want.

1143
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:19,767
Do I look okay?

1144
01:33:19,834 --> 01:33:22,500
- Five.
- Thank you very much.

1145
01:33:22,567 --> 01:33:24,000
Woo Shik.

1146
01:33:24,066 --> 01:33:25,433
I think we'll get an earful.

1147
01:33:26,367 --> 01:33:27,800
Today, I won't be intimidated.

1148
01:33:27,867 --> 01:33:29,533
I think we'll get customers.

1149
01:33:30,033 --> 01:33:31,433
Cheers to today's success.

1150
01:33:32,533 --> 01:33:34,567
Soon, there will be a rush.

1151
01:33:35,100 --> 01:33:38,467
Fresh, carefully picked cilantro.

1152
01:33:40,967 --> 01:33:41,867
All right.

1153
01:33:42,967 --> 01:33:44,333
We're doing great now.

1154
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:46,900
Woo Shik, if we run a food truck,
what should we sell?

1155
01:33:46,967 --> 01:33:48,533
We can sell chicken.

1156
01:33:48,600 --> 01:33:51,467
You can take a break whenever you want.

1157
01:33:51,567 --> 01:33:53,000
Let's open one together.

1158
01:33:55,700 --> 01:33:56,834
- Woo Shik.
- Yes?

1159
01:33:56,900 --> 01:33:57,767
Fry the chickens.

1160
01:33:57,834 --> 01:33:59,000
Oh, right. Sorry.

1161
01:34:01,934 --> 01:34:04,100
I think watermelon will be popular.

1162
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:08,734
Business is hard.

1163
01:34:11,133 --> 01:34:13,467
The clothing store
next to the fruit store…

1164
01:34:13,533 --> 01:34:15,734
- Why did you go to a clothing store?
- Sorry?

1165
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:16,934
Why did you?

1166
01:34:17,333 --> 01:34:18,734
- It's already done.
- The clothing store?

1167
01:34:18,800 --> 01:34:20,200
Why did you go there?

1168
01:34:21,367 --> 01:34:23,967
I never told you to go there.
Why did you go there?

1169
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,467
JINNY'S KITCHEN
