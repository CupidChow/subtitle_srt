00:00:22,433 --> 00:00:26,100
JINNY'S KITCHEN

2
00:00:31,734 --> 00:00:32,734
-Hello.
-Hello.

3
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:35,467
-I'm Woo Shik.
-Long time no see.

4
00:00:35,533 --> 00:00:36,633
Hello.

5
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,000
Hi.

6
00:00:38,066 --> 00:00:40,500
I hear you're busier than ever these days.

7
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:42,400
No, I'm not that busy.

8
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:43,767
If you're too busy,

9
00:00:43,834 --> 00:00:45,934
you don't have to join us this time.

10
00:00:46,633 --> 00:00:48,633
You're telling me that now?

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:51,200
You made me come here just to kick me out?

12
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,600
Well, let's talk first.

13
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:58,200
-Hey, guys.
-It's Yu Mi.

14
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,333
-You came together.
-Hey, Seo Jun.

15
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:04,367
Oh!

16
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:06,033
Choi Woo Shik, the busy man!

17
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:07,600
No way...

18
00:01:07,667 --> 00:01:10,734
-Why come if you're not joining us?
-I wanted to say hi.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,400
Here, have a seat.

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,033
-You're trying too hard.
-Sit, please.

21
00:01:17,467 --> 00:01:18,934
Thought we meet in restaurant.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,266
I thought we could do something different
from Youn's Kitchen.

23
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,967
Like a franchise, as a spin-off.

24
00:01:25,033 --> 00:01:28,667
So that's basically the idea.

25
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:31,433
The place we're going is

26
00:01:32,266 --> 00:01:33,367
in Mexico.

27
00:01:33,433 --> 00:01:35,433
It's a city called "Bacalar".

28
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,233
-Bacalar?
-Bacalar?

29
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:39,967
-Bac… what?
-Ever heard of it?

30
00:01:40,033 --> 00:01:42,633
We're going to a small village there

31
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,900
and open a store.

32
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,100
So we're opening a bed and breakfast?

33
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:00,433
We're opening a restaurant here.

34
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,967
Just a restaurant?

35
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:03,834
Of course.

36
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,667
-We can't run an accommodation.
-An accommodation?

37
00:03:06,734 --> 00:03:08,800
Well, that's how I started, so...

38
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:11,333
Preparing amenities and all…

39
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,600
He used to be a bellhop, so…

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,467
-That's how I started.
-Right, you're an intern.

41
00:03:16,533 --> 00:03:17,967
I started off different.

42
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:20,734
He was in a guesthouse so
not familiar with restaurant.

43
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,100
He doesn't know how to run a restaurant.

44
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:26,033
He's right, but I feel somewhat bitter…

45
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,934
We used to all laugh together…

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,633
"Boss, did you forget about us?"

47
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:35,266
We had a good time then,
making the tteok stuff together.

48
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,200
That was Youn's Stay. Move on.

49
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:43,367
He's one dispassionate businessman.

50
00:03:43,433 --> 00:03:45,433
Oh, I forgot to tell you something.

51
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,767
You know,

52
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:48,667
you can't be vice-president forever.

53
00:03:48,734 --> 00:03:50,266
Mr. President!

54
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:53,133
-The best Mr. President!
-Mr. President!

55
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:55,333
Goodness.

56
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,633
His dimples are beaming.

57
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,533
I've been waiting for this.

58
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,166
Now, the last thing.

59
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:05,066
What food are we serving?

60
00:04:05,133 --> 00:04:07,000
Right.

61
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:08,367
What menu are we selling?

62
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:10,367
It's Jinny's Snack Bar.

63
00:04:10,433 --> 00:04:12,734
Oh! Snack food!

64
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,066
Snack bar!

65
00:04:15,133 --> 00:04:18,300
You're really going to roll
some gimbap, Yu Mi.

66
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:21,333
What?

67
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:24,133
-What's so funny?
-A snack bar president.

68
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:27,633
You seem a little upset…

69
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,133
You just threw a wet blanket here.

70
00:04:30,734 --> 00:04:33,700
-You're the boss, though.
-Right, you are.

71
00:04:33,767 --> 00:04:38,166
Those menus… It's all too hard.

72
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:40,533
It's all hard to make.

73
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,266
There are tuna gimbap
and so many other kinds.

74
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,667
-Squid gimbap.
-Cheese gimbap.

75
00:04:47,734 --> 00:04:50,767
Exactly. The ingredient prep
will require lots of work.

76
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:54,800
It's hard to roll it nice and round. Also…

77
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:57,033
-The cutting.
-The cutting part.

78
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,800
We'll need a really sharp knife.

79
00:04:58,867 --> 00:05:00,333
How do you know all that?

80
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:04,667
I'm 50 years old,
I should know such things.

81
00:05:04,734 --> 00:05:06,900
Using a knife, and cutting, it's all...

82
00:05:07,066 --> 00:05:09,000
-It's a lot of prep.
-That's right.

83
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,266
It might be too much work
for just us here...

84
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,300
So we need a new staff member.

85
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:17,767
To tell you the truth,

86
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:19,166
Seo Jun knows who it is.

87
00:05:19,233 --> 00:05:22,734
I spilled the beans
while talking about something else.

88
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,000
Which means Woo Shik
probably heard about it too.

89
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:28,200
Okay. So you hired one?

90
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,500
Why don't you guess who it is.

91
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:32,333
Our new intern was busy lately

92
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:35,400
due to a concert everybody in Korea
knows about.

93
00:05:35,467 --> 00:05:37,400
That's why he couldn't be here today.

94
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:38,633
Oh!

95
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,300
You know who I'm talking about?

96
00:05:40,367 --> 00:05:43,166
Isn't it the one held in Busan?

97
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:45,066
I didn't know you'd be interested.

98
00:05:45,133 --> 00:05:47,900
It's making headlines everywhere.
Of course, I know.

99
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:50,033
It's on the Six O'Clock News too.

100
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,433
They're close with V.

101
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,767
Why do you look so upset?

102
00:05:54,834 --> 00:05:55,734
No, I...

103
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,600
No, I like him.

104
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,467
We didn't sell much juice today.

105
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:06,967
-Juice?
-We sold only two.

106
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,934
But I had four.

107
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,667
What?

108
00:06:11,734 --> 00:06:12,734
You drank our juice?

109
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,066
Yes, I drank a lot of juice.

110
00:06:18,066 --> 00:06:20,834
-I was so thirsty.
-Good job.

111
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,000
Welfare is about providing

112
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,133
a good workplace environment.

113
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:40,934
All right! Let's open the place.

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,900
-We're opening.
-Okay.

115
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,667
Okay, first one is
the spicy stir-fried noodles.

116
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:59,300
Spicy stir-fried noodles
and original ramyeon.

117
00:06:59,367 --> 00:07:00,500
Let's begin.

118
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:02,567
Good luck!

119
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:07,734
Let me know if you need anything,
Intern Kim right at your service!

120
00:07:08,934 --> 00:07:10,400
Hey!

121
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:12,867
I'm a dishwasher from Samseong-dong.

122
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:21,533
You're taking out the trash. Nice.

123
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,467
You're now watching a human juicer.

124
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,233
There's one more thing to do
to be promoted.

125
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:31,133
I'm listening.

126
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,900
It's speed.

127
00:07:32,967 --> 00:07:35,100
They call it comes from experience.

128
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:38,633
I'll never make so many ramyeons like this
in my life ever again.

129
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:41,600
-Quickly.
-Okay.

130
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:57,900
It's all doable,
until we run out of ingredients.

131
00:07:57,967 --> 00:08:00,800
Our teamwork is getting better every day.

132
00:08:01,033 --> 00:08:02,867
Back in my days, we didn't have that.

133
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,133
What?

134
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,100
I only used knives for this before.

135
00:08:08,934 --> 00:08:13,166
Sesame oil, salt, sesame seeds.

136
00:08:18,133 --> 00:08:21,734
Carefully selected cilantro

137
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,200
in fried tofu gimbap.

138
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:30,066
I'll be a gimbap master.

139
00:08:32,066 --> 00:08:33,066
Oh, no.

140
00:08:34,433 --> 00:08:36,000
It's no biggie.

141
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,934
It's going well.

142
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,767
They all love spicy food.

143
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,900
-We can't always have good days, you know.
-Sure.

144
00:08:43,967 --> 00:08:46,934
You're so good at everything.

145
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,100
-It's over 10,000.
-Yes, it's over 10,000.

146
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:57,166
I wonder what's going to happen today.

147
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,767
Today's first order is in.

148
00:09:00,433 --> 00:09:01,533
We got an order.

149
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,200
We got an order.

150
00:09:04,133 --> 00:09:05,133
New order.

151
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,333
Okay, let's go!

152
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,967
You guys have to come and order.

153
00:09:15,266 --> 00:09:17,767
Sorry, I didn't tell you. It's my fault.
I'm sorry.

154
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:20,800
♪ Macho, macho man ♪

155
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,967
Tae Hyung, we need the chicken right now.

156
00:09:26,367 --> 00:09:28,000
-It's ready.
-Oh, okay.

157
00:09:28,667 --> 00:09:32,500
-Anyone free by any chance?
-No.

158
00:09:33,567 --> 00:09:35,066
He's our new owner now.

159
00:09:36,433 --> 00:09:39,633
It's my Korean name. Jinny's Kitchen.

160
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,400
We're only selling ramyeon.

161
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,467
When are we gonna make profit?

162
00:09:44,533 --> 00:09:45,834
Profit matters the most.

163
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:51,333
We must sell the rice bowls.
It's the only way to boost sales.

164
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,100
We should've charged more.

165
00:09:54,033 --> 00:09:55,533
Let's put one more table.

166
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,967
I thought we were saving it
for the last day.

167
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:05,867
There was an announcement from the boss.

168
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,500
Until our sales
go over 10,000 pesos today,

169
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:11,066
we're not closing the restaurant.

170
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,500
It's good food. Good food, okay?

171
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,000
Excuse me.

172
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Hey!

173
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,533
-We're gonna make a table for you, okay?
-Yes.

174
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:25,533
That's not the Seo Jin I know.

175
00:10:26,967 --> 00:10:31,333
-See you tonight?
-Thank you.

176
00:10:36,934 --> 00:10:38,500
Do we have job titles too?

177
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:40,800
Job titles? What was Yu Mi before?

178
00:10:40,867 --> 00:10:44,333
-General manager and chef.
-Yes, for Youn's Kitchen.

179
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,934
Seo Jun can be the chef now.

180
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,667
What should Yu Mi do then?

181
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:54,266
You can be Director Jung.

182
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:57,867
-You'll be Executive Director Jung.
-Oh, yes!

183
00:10:57,934 --> 00:11:00,300
Well, that's a big jump…

184
00:11:00,367 --> 00:11:03,467
That means we don't have
mid-level management.

185
00:11:05,567 --> 00:11:07,867
-How much share does she hold?
-Enough.

186
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,767
-"How much share does she hold"?
-Share?

187
00:11:11,834 --> 00:11:14,233
Otherwise, she wouldn't come to work.

188
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,200
How much authority does she have?

189
00:11:17,867 --> 00:11:19,834
She's responsible for everything now.

190
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:22,467
If something goes wrong
and someone's sentenced…

191
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:25,533
Seo Jun is the chef now.

192
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,333
The senior manager and the chef.

193
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,367
-The role goes down.
-So much pressure.

194
00:11:29,967 --> 00:11:31,533
I only cook by recipes.

195
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,900
This title gives me too much pressure.

196
00:11:34,467 --> 00:11:36,500
Then what's Woo Shik?

197
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:39,000
He's finally not an intern anymore?

198
00:11:39,066 --> 00:11:40,934
Assistant manager.

199
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,900
He has no restaurant experience, right?

200
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:46,100
So he's an intern again?

201
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:48,533
That's true, though.

202
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,767
-Wait, no way.
-It is his first time.

203
00:11:50,834 --> 00:11:52,600
There's a new guy coming and--

204
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:54,600
Listen.

205
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:57,433
Unless you go with us,
you can't get a promotion.

206
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,100
Are you joining late?

207
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:02,066
Most likely. So far...

208
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,967
-He has a point then.
-He does.

209
00:12:05,033 --> 00:12:07,567
If you can't work full schedule,
you're an intern.

210
00:12:07,633 --> 00:12:10,266
So the new guy and I will be
the same position?

211
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:14,533
-No, you'll be under him.
-He'll be a senior to you.

212
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,166
Because he'll be joining us
from the start.

213
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:19,467
You're right.

214
00:12:19,533 --> 00:12:22,433
Because he can show up the whole time.

215
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:25,567
As a restaurant staff,
he'll be senior to you.

216
00:12:26,667 --> 00:12:29,667
You guys are heartless, aren't you?

217
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:32,233
We used to work together
through thick and thin--

218
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:35,533
You worked in a guesthouse,
not a restaurant.

219
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,533
You're excluding him.
You do have a point though.

220
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,667
How old is Tae Hyung?

221
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,767
He's younger than me.

222
00:12:43,834 --> 00:12:45,066
He was born in 1995.

223
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,433
-He's very young.
-He's five years younger than me.

224
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:51,567
But now
it feels like he's the eldest.

225
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,600
That's why we forget how old he is.

226
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:58,734
-You all seem the same age.
-I've really never thought about

227
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,633
our age difference from the get-go.

228
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:04,000
Anyway, since he's the youngest
and the newest here…

229
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:06,166
It'll be your first time working with him.

230
00:13:06,233 --> 00:13:08,867
So I think he should meet Seo Jin
at least once.

231
00:13:08,934 --> 00:13:11,367
Can we arrange a video call with him now?

232
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:12,700
Sure. I'll try.

233
00:13:16,867 --> 00:13:18,834
-I can't see anything. Hello?
-Hello.

234
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,367
Hello. Are you on your way up here?

235
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,867
Yes, I'm on my way to Seoul now. Hello.

236
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,033
Oh, I see.

237
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,667
I thought you should say hi to them.
That's why I called.

238
00:13:30,734 --> 00:13:32,734
All right. I'll say hi.

239
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,433
One second.
I'll let you talk to the boss first.

240
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,033
Hello, Boss!

241
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:45,133
I'm Kim Tae Hyung.

242
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,200
Okay...

243
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:47,800
What should I say?

244
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:51,967
He's just an intern.

245
00:13:52,033 --> 00:13:54,266
You were so casual with Woo Shik.

246
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:57,033
He's an intern too.
Why are you careful with him?

247
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,533
Anyway…

248
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,834
Have a safe trip.

249
00:14:00,967 --> 00:14:03,133
-Okay, thanks.
-I'll see you soon then.

250
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:05,667
Okay.

251
00:14:05,734 --> 00:14:07,967
-He looks different.
-I'm hanging up.

252
00:14:08,667 --> 00:14:09,667
Okay.

253
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:14,900
- Oh, hey.
- Hello.

254
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:16,600
This way.

255
00:14:17,467 --> 00:14:20,033
-The others aren't here yet.
-Right. They're coming.

256
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,100
Right, have a seat.

257
00:14:23,934 --> 00:14:25,600
-Awkward, right?
-Yes.

258
00:14:25,667 --> 00:14:27,300
You've never met Seo Jin, right?

259
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:29,834
No, never in my life.

260
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,367
But you've met Yu Mi though?

261
00:14:31,433 --> 00:14:34,967
Yes. I think I've met her a couple times.

262
00:14:35,033 --> 00:14:39,734
Then you've met everyone
but Seo Jin before.

263
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,066
I'm sure you'll easily fit in.

264
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,667
-Hello.
-Yes. Come on in.

265
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:46,600
You're here.

266
00:14:49,433 --> 00:14:50,767
Why are you all late?

267
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,166
Have a seat. Seo Jin, you can sit here.

268
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,133
Should I sit here?

269
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,533
Did you want to sit here?

270
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:00,467
I'll go ahead and ask for the grill.

271
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:07,400
Actually, the hierarchy within the staff
is a hot potato right now.

272
00:15:07,467 --> 00:15:11,066
Considering that
I will have to teach him a lot…

273
00:15:11,133 --> 00:15:12,600
-Like what?
-Teach him what?

274
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,400
About Youn's Kitchen--

275
00:15:14,467 --> 00:15:16,300
What do you know? You weren't there.

276
00:15:16,367 --> 00:15:19,400
-I still did...
-It's different from a guesthouse.

277
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,533
I hope we get along.

278
00:15:24,367 --> 00:15:26,367
Anyway, Tae Hyung will be senior to you.

279
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:27,700
Not necessarily…

280
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:30,333
He's joining the team
two days earlier than you.

281
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:33,300
I'll try to fit in within those two days.

282
00:15:33,367 --> 00:15:35,233
I'm sure you can do it.

283
00:15:38,433 --> 00:15:42,500
I took a cooking class recently.

284
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,867
-Really?
-And Spanish.

285
00:15:47,033 --> 00:15:48,367
A bit of Spanish...

286
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,133
What did you do?

287
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
As the boss said earlier,

288
00:15:53,066 --> 00:15:56,100
don't try too hard.

289
00:15:57,533 --> 00:16:00,100
Our boss doesn't like that.

290
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,033
Do we know who's in charge of what?

291
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,000
She's in charge of gimbap

292
00:16:05,066 --> 00:16:06,867
and Seo Jun's in charge of the rest.

293
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:08,834
And you'll be serving.

294
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,734
You'll be assisting both of them.

295
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,000
Tae Hyung,
you'll be helping us with the prep

296
00:16:15,066 --> 00:16:18,166
and also serve tables outside.

297
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:21,433
So I'm a regular employee
and he's an intern?

298
00:16:23,033 --> 00:16:25,200
That's a very good point, Tae Hyung.

299
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:27,767
That's what the CEO has to decide.

300
00:16:27,834 --> 00:16:29,934
Let's say we're all there.

301
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,367
What if I get everything in one day?

302
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,000
Like this.

303
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:36,934
Then I…

304
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,800
Even though nobody taught you?

305
00:16:38,867 --> 00:16:40,266
Yes.

306
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,000
"Señorita."

307
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:45,000
Sorry, I don't…

308
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,133
It's sorry.

309
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,467
See? That won't happen.

310
00:16:56,533 --> 00:16:59,934
My gosh. That was hilarious.

311
00:17:03,533 --> 00:17:08,533
Then how long will we be working?

312
00:17:09,066 --> 00:17:13,133
-Of course. The working hours.
-You can ask him about that.

313
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:15,367
He'll have all the answers.

314
00:17:15,433 --> 00:17:18,934
If we get super busy from day one,

315
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:21,133
-do we get days off?
-No.

316
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,800
He'll keep the store open for longer then.

317
00:17:24,867 --> 00:17:27,767
He's changed since he became boss.

318
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:33,867
It's like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

319
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:38,133
Things are going quite well.

320
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,567
He's suddenly looking happy.

321
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:43,200
What's going on?

322
00:17:43,266 --> 00:17:44,533
Why aren't we busy?

323
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,567
You said people are crazy for K-food.

324
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:48,834
Crazy, my foot.

325
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,867
We just got a reservation.

326
00:17:50,934 --> 00:17:53,767
He's not the dude I knew before.
He's a boss now.

327
00:17:53,834 --> 00:17:56,033
He's not the same dude I used to know.

328
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,433
Great to see you.

329
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,233
So you need to learn
how to make corn dogs,

330
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,900
gimbap, and…

331
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:11,500
tteokbokki.

332
00:18:11,567 --> 00:18:14,834
They are all highly specialized menus.

333
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,533
Can we change the menu now?

334
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:21,433
It's the most basic one.

335
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,533
Push it all the way through.

336
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,033
What's next?

337
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,600
-The batter.
-That's right.

338
00:18:26,667 --> 00:18:28,300
What's most important here is

339
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:30,100
to make it as quickly as possible.

340
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:32,834
-Oh, this is hard.
-Tough, right?

341
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,000
This is the perfect consistency.

342
00:18:36,066 --> 00:18:38,166
Which is harder to make?
Gimbap? Corndogs?

343
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,500
I think gimbap is ten times harder.

344
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,967
Since you'll be cooking for non-Koreans,

345
00:18:45,033 --> 00:18:46,934
I suggest adding fresh veggies inside.

346
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,567
And serve it with a dipping sauce.

347
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:50,633
Fried tofu.

348
00:18:51,433 --> 00:18:53,266
Now, it's time to roll it.

349
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:57,900
The moment you start rolling,
you know it's 90 percent done.

350
00:18:59,133 --> 00:19:00,066
Okay.

351
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,734
Oh, no. It fell apart.

352
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,633
What do I do?

353
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,333
-No, no.
-You're good.

354
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,934
Once you get flustered, you're doomed.

355
00:19:16,367 --> 00:19:18,700
Lettuce and perilla leaves...

356
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:22,200
Prep the common ingredients first and...

357
00:19:22,266 --> 00:19:24,033
Being senior or not...

358
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,467
There's no time to discuss that.

359
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,533
Can't you come a little earlier?

360
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:33,867
300, 400.

361
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,233
Will we ever get to see our rooms?

362
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,500
I got it.

363
00:20:12,266 --> 00:20:14,367
-It's huge.
-It'll fit everything.

364
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:19,300
I can't believe they all fit in.

365
00:20:20,767 --> 00:20:22,367
Hey, help me out.

366
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,133
Why is your bag so heavy?

367
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,934
I brought only one bag.

368
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:32,967
Thank you.

369
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:38,166
I hope it's okay for me
to sit in the back.

370
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,567
-Where else would you sit?
-In the front?

371
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:43,433
-What? Why would you?
-In the front...

372
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,867
-It's a bit cold.
-I'll get the navi for you.

373
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,867
-Should I start the car?
-Yes, let's go.

374
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:52,800
This car is big.

375
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:59,700
Tae Hyung, you can drive
with one hand if you want.

376
00:20:59,767 --> 00:21:03,567
You don't have to be so nervous,
holding it with both hands.

377
00:21:03,633 --> 00:21:06,100
Let me know if anything bothers you.

378
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,467
Your posture bothers me.

379
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:13,233
He's a model driver.

380
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,233
He's the perfect model driver.

381
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:18,133
Wow, so pretty clouds.

382
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:21,433
Fascinating.

383
00:21:23,667 --> 00:21:26,367
Bacalar. I just saw the name.

384
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,166
We're five minutes away.

385
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:31,367
Isn't that the lake? I think it is.

386
00:21:31,433 --> 00:21:33,567
-Oh, I see it.
-It's the lake.

387
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,233
-Do you see it?
-This must be it.

388
00:21:39,266 --> 00:21:41,000
It's got the color of the sea.

389
00:21:41,066 --> 00:21:42,667
It's emerald green.

390
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,800
I feel like we won't sell any gimbap here.

391
00:22:26,233 --> 00:22:28,633
There must be a town in there.

392
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,233
You think?

393
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,033
This place is so secluded.

394
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,834
How can we run a restaurant
where there are no people?

395
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,367
I don't see any human beings.

396
00:22:43,433 --> 00:22:45,100
Who's gonna come here to eat?

397
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,266
We can do it like Three Meals a Day.

398
00:22:50,767 --> 00:22:53,967
What kind of...
There's no way we can do business here.

399
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,767
Wait, Tae Hyung.

400
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:08,100
-Just go straight.
-Go straight?

401
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,400
Go straight and around.

402
00:23:11,967 --> 00:23:15,166
This neighborhood is cute.

403
00:23:16,767 --> 00:23:19,266
There are quite some people
in the restaurants.

404
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:20,834
In the restaurants?

405
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,066
I guess they're in there
to avoid the heat.

406
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:34,000
I feel like our restaurant will be
around here.

407
00:23:34,233 --> 00:23:36,233
-Oh, yea?
-This is a one way.

408
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,400
-Oh, construction...
-Is it here?

409
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:41,233
It's too nice!

410
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,433
No, that's a hotel.

411
00:24:02,934 --> 00:24:05,967
"Jinny's Kitchen."

412
00:24:06,033 --> 00:24:08,033
-Let's go.
-Let's just go.

413
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,266
-Go, go. It's here.
-Wait...

414
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,500
Go, go. It's here.

415
00:24:20,233 --> 00:24:23,800
Did you see Seo Jin's face?

416
00:24:23,867 --> 00:24:27,300
-No, I didn't get to see it.
-Not me.

417
00:24:27,367 --> 00:24:29,367
The location is great.

418
00:24:30,266 --> 00:24:32,066
The location is horrible.

419
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:33,867
It's right next to a hotel.

420
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,400
-I think it's here.
-Thank you for driving.

421
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:17,333
Seriously?

422
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,734
Hey, look!

423
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,800
-Bicycles!
-Bicycles!

424
00:25:21,867 --> 00:25:23,867
A swimming pool!

425
00:25:23,934 --> 00:25:25,567
A flamingo!

426
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:35,300
This is all part of the lake?

427
00:26:06,033 --> 00:26:06,867
Is it salty?

428
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,800
I haven't tasted it yet.

429
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,200
The water isn't that cold.

430
00:26:12,567 --> 00:26:13,533
It's not salty.

431
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,633
All right, let's see.

432
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,767
Let's see…

433
00:26:22,867 --> 00:26:24,233
Is this a cucumber?

434
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:32,867
Tae Hyung, have you practiced chopping?

435
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:35,500
-I learned how to do this.
-Oh, with the shredder?

436
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:37,400
How many should I roll now?

437
00:26:37,867 --> 00:26:38,934
Not to many.

438
00:27:25,033 --> 00:27:26,467
But it was 1 to 1.

439
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:31,533
For the best consistency…

440
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:37,767
All right. Now just a bit more water…

441
00:27:44,367 --> 00:27:45,767
I think you got it.

442
00:27:47,033 --> 00:27:48,600
Yes, that's it.

443
00:27:48,967 --> 00:27:54,266
It was 1,200g of batter mix
and 850g of water.

444
00:27:55,233 --> 00:27:58,667
Man, looks like
it's gonna take some time.

445
00:27:58,734 --> 00:28:01,166
This can't be done so quick.

446
00:28:09,767 --> 00:28:12,767
I never thought
I'd ever see Tae Hyung cook.

447
00:28:13,834 --> 00:28:16,200
You should cook for your parents too.

448
00:28:16,266 --> 00:28:18,600
"Mom, just sit there. I'll do it for you."

449
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,934
"Just stay there."

450
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,800
Should I try rolling one?

451
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,433
Nicely and smoothly.

452
00:28:32,934 --> 00:28:34,600
Stop trying to read my face.

453
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,433
I didn't. I was just looking.

454
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,367
I was just showing you how to do it.

455
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:40,066
All right.

456
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:42,633
Go like this and swiftly with the rice...

457
00:28:45,567 --> 00:28:47,600
You're making me nervous.

458
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,133
Yu Mi, you can do it.

459
00:28:52,066 --> 00:28:53,467
Two pieces of lettuce.

460
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:56,066
Create a wall with the radish.

461
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:58,300
And put much more fried tofu
than you think.

462
00:28:59,266 --> 00:29:01,266
-It'll be huge.
-Isn't that too much?

463
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:02,233
No, it isn't.

464
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,266
I need to put lots of carrots too.

465
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:06,967
-It's gonna be too thick.
-No, it's not. Just wait.

466
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:08,367
And this much of cucumbers.

467
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,300
I'll go ahead and roll this one.

468
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:13,367
Here we go.

469
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:17,333
I should go at once.

470
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,100
It has to come in like this.

471
00:29:21,967 --> 00:29:23,133
It shouldn't stick out.

472
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,567
I told you. You put everything too much.

473
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:44,533
I put too much rice.

474
00:29:44,834 --> 00:29:46,367
What's up?

475
00:29:46,433 --> 00:29:48,000
They won't even stick together.

476
00:29:57,266 --> 00:29:59,367
It worked. It's fine.

477
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:02,266
This won't do.

478
00:30:08,667 --> 00:30:10,266
Oh, no…

479
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,767
Maybe you should add fewer veggies.

480
00:30:13,834 --> 00:30:15,734
No, the amount of veggies was right.

481
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,500
I added too much rice.

482
00:30:20,867 --> 00:30:22,433
You can do it, Yu Mi. Focus.

483
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,033
Have confidence.

484
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:26,767
-You need confidence.
-Okay, thank you.

485
00:30:33,567 --> 00:30:34,433
Lettuce.

486
00:30:34,767 --> 00:30:35,600
Fried tofu.

487
00:30:36,166 --> 00:30:37,000
All right, done.

488
00:30:47,233 --> 00:30:49,233
It worked. Well done.

489
00:30:58,333 --> 00:31:00,700
-The end piece--
-Hey! I did it!

490
00:31:10,533 --> 00:31:12,133
The rice. Season it more, right?

491
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,834
I should add more salt.

492
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,834
-Right?
-Yes.

493
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,200
Which gimbap is this?

494
00:31:19,934 --> 00:31:21,300
-The vegan one.
-Fried tofu.

495
00:31:21,467 --> 00:31:22,300
Good, huh?

496
00:31:25,533 --> 00:31:27,767
I think it's good because of the veggies.

497
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:29,367
Yes, I was told to add lots.

498
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,567
So nerve-racking.

499
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,066
Thank you.

500
00:31:48,266 --> 00:31:51,233
It tastes so sweet after all the labor.

501
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:56,333
This requires technique.

502
00:32:05,367 --> 00:32:08,433
This tastes like some fancy tteokbokki.

503
00:32:10,834 --> 00:32:12,500
It's so good!

504
00:32:30,834 --> 00:32:32,600
Hey, it's going to be a long fight.

505
00:32:35,734 --> 00:32:36,633
I'm so hot.

506
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:44,033
I think it's done.

507
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,800
He's a natural chef.

508
00:32:59,567 --> 00:33:00,800
Yes.

509
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:02,400
There's more coming.

510
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:10,734
You like it?

511
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,066
-It's good, isn't it?
-It's really good.

512
00:33:15,233 --> 00:33:17,667
He looks like
some chicken restaurant owner now.

513
00:33:26,834 --> 00:33:28,367
That looks crazy.

514
00:33:28,433 --> 00:33:29,800
Let's add some parsley too.

515
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:31,600
-Parsley?
-Yes.

516
00:33:33,467 --> 00:33:34,900
Try the one with potatoes.

517
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:38,533
That one only has sausage inside.

518
00:33:44,333 --> 00:33:46,000
It even looks nice.

519
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,500
It should be at least 150 pesos.

520
00:33:49,033 --> 00:33:51,533
The potato one is definitely
worth 150 pesos.

521
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,367
Yu Mi, you did a great job.

522
00:33:58,433 --> 00:33:59,467
I'm glad you like it.

523
00:34:00,066 --> 00:34:01,834
What's in the gimbap sauce?

524
00:34:02,333 --> 00:34:04,734
It's 70 percent mayo
and 30 percent ssamjang.

525
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,633
-Make it 50-50.
-50-50?

526
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:09,000
I don't really like mayonnaise.

527
00:34:09,433 --> 00:34:11,800
You can't push your personal preference.

528
00:34:27,467 --> 00:34:29,266
-This is exciting.
-Yes.

529
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,233
-Let's go.
-Okay.

530
00:34:40,867 --> 00:34:42,633
-Open the door, please.
-Okay.

531
00:34:51,433 --> 00:34:52,400
I think we're here.

532
00:34:56,834 --> 00:34:57,967
It's huge.

533
00:35:22,467 --> 00:35:25,266
One is good. A big...

534
00:35:26,934 --> 00:35:27,834
Hi. Hola.

535
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:29,300
Hola, hi.

536
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:34,600
-We can buy stuff here.
-Okay.

537
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:36,767
-Yu Mi, carrots.
-Pick some yourself.

538
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:40,133
-Go ahead.
-Since I'll be chopping them?

539
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,533
How many should we buy? 20?

540
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,934
In case we'll be busy tomorrow.

541
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,333
We have to be optimistic.

542
00:35:47,367 --> 00:35:48,967
-Are these good ones?
-You think?

543
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,333
-We should buy as many limes as possible.
-Sure.

544
00:35:55,633 --> 00:35:58,066
Yu Mi, I think cilantro
and lettuce are here.

545
00:35:58,567 --> 00:36:00,867
-Which one is lettuce?
-Lettuce is...

546
00:36:00,934 --> 00:36:01,900
Is it this one?

547
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:04,000
This is lettuce.

548
00:36:07,133 --> 00:36:08,367
Is this spinach?

549
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,300
Should we put it in our stew?

550
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:12,834
By the way, the cilantro…

551
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,367
-It's the only option.
-That's too much.

552
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,333
Are there smaller bulks?

553
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:20,633
Cilantro… Let's go check out that place.

554
00:36:21,033 --> 00:36:21,900
Or there?

555
00:36:21,967 --> 00:36:23,500
-What do you say?
-There.

556
00:36:23,567 --> 00:36:24,567
It looks so fresh.

557
00:36:24,633 --> 00:36:26,533
-Hola.
-Hola.

558
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,266
Cilantro, please.

559
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:30,800
Please, cilantro.

560
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,633
Enough, right?

561
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:38,066
-Gracias.
-Gracias.

562
00:36:38,934 --> 00:36:41,467
-We got everything, right?
-Yes.

563
00:36:49,066 --> 00:36:51,133
-I see something yellow.
-You do?

564
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,033
Oh, my!

565
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:56,066
-Jinny's Kitchen!
-Jinny's Kitchen!

566
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,166
Jinny's Kitchen!

567
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,266
Let's get out!

568
00:37:05,166 --> 00:37:07,066
Don't forget this bag here.

569
00:37:13,233 --> 00:37:15,433
By the way, I don't see any passersby.

570
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,333
Exactly.

571
00:37:21,834 --> 00:37:23,200
Oh, it's here.

572
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,133
There are more seats than I imagined.

573
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,800
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

574
00:38:24,233 --> 00:38:25,367
There are seven tables.

575
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:38,700
Dang…

576
00:38:48,633 --> 00:38:50,767
A lot of effort was put into the interior.

577
00:38:50,834 --> 00:38:51,867
The food comes here?

578
00:38:51,934 --> 00:38:53,934
-Right.
-It's so high.

579
00:38:54,533 --> 00:38:56,967
Wait. We should check the kitchen too.

580
00:38:57,333 --> 00:39:00,734
-This must be where you work.
-I didn't expect this.

581
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,500
What if the customers talk to me?

582
00:39:02,567 --> 00:39:04,867
-I think they definitely will.
-I'm scared.

583
00:39:05,433 --> 00:39:06,700
This is bad.

584
00:39:06,767 --> 00:39:09,467
I'm not good at handling
the pressure of being watched.

585
00:39:16,834 --> 00:39:18,400
We should check the kitchen.

586
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:20,133
Let's take a look at the kitchen.

587
00:39:29,266 --> 00:39:30,433
Oh, my gosh!

588
00:39:31,066 --> 00:39:33,567
-Very nice.
-Seo Jun.

589
00:39:33,633 --> 00:39:37,200
-This is my territory.
-It's so nice! Amazing.

590
00:39:37,567 --> 00:39:39,233
This whole place is for you?

591
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:41,600
-Our kitchen is so big.
-This is awesome.

592
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,700
-Very nice.
-You do all you want.

593
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:45,800
-This is amazing.
-Wait...

594
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,767
-I have to go around like this.
-Amazing.

595
00:39:50,233 --> 00:39:51,400
This is a huge kitchen.

596
00:39:52,834 --> 00:39:55,433
-Where's the sink for washing dishes?
-Over there.

597
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:11,333
It's five o'clock now.

598
00:40:11,734 --> 00:40:12,734
When we'll be ready?

599
00:40:13,567 --> 00:40:16,133
I think two hours will be
enough for the prep.

600
00:40:16,367 --> 00:40:17,633
When we open at 7--

601
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,867
I don't want you to think
that we open at seven.

602
00:40:20,934 --> 00:40:23,967
I want us to be ready to open by 6:30 AM.

603
00:40:27,433 --> 00:40:30,633
I'm just saying, that way,
we can get things done quickly.

604
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,900
If you think we open at seven,
you'll take it slow.

605
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:36,600
We've never taken anything slow.

606
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,567
He's pushing us too hard.

607
00:40:39,633 --> 00:40:42,700
He's not the dude I knew before.
He's a boss now.

608
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:45,533
He's not the same dude I used to know.

609
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,867
I've never heard him talk like that.

610
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:50,767
I just want to see
how much time we'll need.

611
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,100
I just don't want us
to hurry too much in the morning.

612
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:56,533
-It's better for you all, too.
-Right.

613
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,967
Yes, I get your intentions.

614
00:40:59,266 --> 00:41:01,333
-Shall we begin now?
-Yes.

615
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,266
-Let's do this.
-Let's go.

616
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:06,066
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

617
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,800
I'm gonna stick it here.

618
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,000
It's an old habit from being a part-timer.

619
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,467
I wish we get lots of customers.

620
00:41:24,367 --> 00:41:27,800
I guess that's how the human mind works.

621
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:29,433
Don't want to waste our effort.

622
00:41:32,133 --> 00:41:34,133
-The intern is over there.
-Sorry?

623
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,734
-He's cutting the veggies.
-Can't see him from here.

624
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,834
-Does it tickle?
-It does.

625
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,367
It opens tomorrow?

626
00:41:59,467 --> 00:42:00,734
-You open tomorrow?
-Yes.

627
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,100
It opens tomorrow.

628
00:42:05,533 --> 00:42:08,800
-We open tomorrow, yes.
-What is it going to be? Is it like Udon?

629
00:42:08,867 --> 00:42:11,133
-Go tell them.
-What kind of food...

630
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,233
-Tteok-bok-ki?
-Hello.

631
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:15,734
It's Korean food?

632
00:42:15,967 --> 00:42:17,367
-It's Korean food.
-Good.

633
00:42:17,433 --> 00:42:19,600
Do you have a menu? Not yet?

634
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:21,233
Menu? Not yet.

635
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,100
Tomorrow you open when, what time?

636
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,133
At 12 PM. Yes.

637
00:42:27,867 --> 00:42:29,433
Are you the chef?

638
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:30,633
No, I'm not the chef.

639
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:31,734
I'm the owner.

640
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,633
-The chef is in the kitchen.
-Okay. We'll come tomorrow.

641
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,900
-All right. See you tomorrow.
-Thank you.

642
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,233
-Are they coming tomorrow?
-Yes.

643
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,333
-They asked if I'm the chef.
-What did you say?

644
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:50,333
I said I'm the owner.

645
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,100
I said the chef is in the kitchen.

646
00:43:06,467 --> 00:43:09,133
I seriously think
I might die from making the batter.

647
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:15,633
Done.

648
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,233
Things are going smoothly.

649
00:43:20,367 --> 00:43:23,266
Our only crisis will be
not having customers.

650
00:43:31,934 --> 00:43:33,433
And now we have a crisis.

651
00:43:33,967 --> 00:43:35,467
Spoiled just the sugar.

652
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,166
-Yu Mi.
-Yes?

653
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:43,233
Nice.

654
00:43:49,333 --> 00:43:51,233
Right, the sauce for the meat.

655
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,333
All right. There's soy sauce.

656
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,667
The pear juice will make it sweeter.

657
00:44:08,633 --> 00:44:09,533
One cup of water.

658
00:44:11,266 --> 00:44:12,100
Minced garlic.

659
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,300
One-third? No, two-third of a cup.

660
00:44:17,467 --> 00:44:18,600
And then, this.

661
00:44:18,667 --> 00:44:20,633
One, two, three, four, five, six.

662
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,066
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

663
00:44:33,967 --> 00:44:37,500
While marinating the meat,
I'm gonna make the dipping sauce.

664
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,200
Are you sure you can do all that?

665
00:44:41,367 --> 00:44:43,100
Tae Hyung is a proactive worker.

666
00:44:50,233 --> 00:44:51,834
I just got the chills.

667
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,000
That was the exact amount I was going for.

668
00:44:54,367 --> 00:44:55,800
No more, no less.

669
00:44:56,467 --> 00:44:57,400
Lemon juice…

670
00:44:58,266 --> 00:44:59,767
We can use lime juice instead.

671
00:45:08,767 --> 00:45:10,066
I put one more gram of it.

672
00:45:11,867 --> 00:45:14,433
Tae Hyung, one gram is a lot.

673
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:16,934
Don't be like this. Stay focused.

674
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,533
Seriously, stay focused.

675
00:45:31,433 --> 00:45:33,767
What's wrong with me? Wake up.

676
00:45:34,033 --> 00:45:36,533
Hey, Jung Yu Mi. Stay focused.

677
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:37,667
Understand?

678
00:45:38,633 --> 00:45:39,667
Stay focused.

679
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,166
Don't look. I'll do it by myself.

680
00:45:48,233 --> 00:45:50,233
I'll give it to you when it's done.

681
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:51,533
Don't forget to plate it.

682
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,166
The plating, right.

683
00:45:53,567 --> 00:45:58,200
Okay, the laver. Now, the lettuce.

684
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:00,567
Two pieces of lettuce.

685
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,133
More.

686
00:46:03,266 --> 00:46:04,100
More.

687
00:46:05,166 --> 00:46:06,000
More.

688
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:11,133
Until it seems almost too much.

689
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,633
It better roll up good and stick together.

690
00:46:48,767 --> 00:46:50,233
What? What's up?

691
00:46:50,734 --> 00:46:54,400
-It's hard to sprinkle this, right?
-Oh, we can bring one at our place.

692
00:46:54,467 --> 00:46:56,367
-Yes, I just asked for it.
-Alright.

693
00:47:11,834 --> 00:47:14,133
It's okay. This should be good enough.

694
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,633
-What do you think? Pretty, right?
-It looks great.

695
00:48:26,533 --> 00:48:28,500
The top part is missing.

696
00:48:35,433 --> 00:48:36,567
The top part...

697
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,734
This one's ruined too.

698
00:48:44,066 --> 00:48:45,467
Did I make them too long?

699
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,266
I should make them shorter.

700
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,033
The sausages are bigger

701
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:00,567
than the ones I used for practice.

702
00:49:00,967 --> 00:49:03,333
So it touched the bottom of the fryer.

703
00:49:04,266 --> 00:49:05,700
Even if I skewer it this far.

704
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,333
I'm trying again but…

705
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,533
Seo Jun, watch this.

706
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,867
You don't want to do that
with watery ingredients.

707
00:49:34,266 --> 00:49:36,767
It needs to be simmered more.

708
00:49:37,367 --> 00:49:39,467
Until there is hardly any sauce.

709
00:49:40,233 --> 00:49:42,834
You should start early
as it needs time to cool down.

710
00:49:44,166 --> 00:49:46,066
I guess this goes into the fridge now.

711
00:49:46,133 --> 00:49:47,400
No, it'll be cooked next.

712
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,133
-You cook it first?
-Yes.

713
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,633
If this goes in the fridge now,
it'll be salty.

714
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:54,767
I should cook it first.
It's okay to keep it cold.

715
00:49:54,834 --> 00:49:55,934
-Is that so?
-Yes.

716
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,700
I need to cook all of it today.

717
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,433
Then...

718
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:07,500
I made them too big.

719
00:50:08,734 --> 00:50:12,734
-And the top parts are missing, like this.
-Oh, I see.

720
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:15,600
-Well, just be careful tomorrow.
-They should be smaller.

721
00:50:34,333 --> 00:50:36,834
-What do I do?
-You can try again.

722
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,367
I ran out of ingredients.

723
00:50:38,433 --> 00:50:39,967
-Oh, really?
-All used up?

724
00:50:40,033 --> 00:50:42,700
-Is it that bad?
-Let's just go, tomorrow...

725
00:50:57,166 --> 00:51:00,333
Seo Jin, are we opening at noon tomorrow?

726
00:51:00,633 --> 00:51:04,266
-Yes, we should.
-The prep took three hours.

727
00:51:04,333 --> 00:51:05,767
But I think…

728
00:51:05,834 --> 00:51:09,467
it won't take this long tomorrow.

729
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:11,033
We did a lot in advance today.

730
00:51:11,166 --> 00:51:13,734
-We made the tteokbokki sauce and…
-And bulgogi.

731
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,133
The bulgogi is ready too.

732
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:16,800
Still, we should be here by ten.

733
00:51:17,734 --> 00:51:19,133
I learned today

734
00:51:19,533 --> 00:51:21,333
that it takes longer than we thought

735
00:51:24,133 --> 00:51:24,967
Are you hungry?

736
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:26,533
Yes.

737
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,667
Are we going to eat now?

738
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,700
Why are you frowning?

739
00:51:32,500 --> 00:51:34,233
-Why are you frowning?
-I wasn't.

740
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:35,700
Are we going to eat now?

741
00:51:35,767 --> 00:51:37,000
Are we?

742
00:51:38,033 --> 00:51:40,900
Fine. Stop frowning.

743
00:51:49,467 --> 00:51:50,700
We're back.

744
00:51:50,767 --> 00:51:51,533
Seo Jun, come in.

745
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:52,633
Yu Mi, come here.

746
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,467
-Tae Hyung.
-Yes?

747
00:51:54,533 --> 00:51:57,567
Let's set the price for the menus.

748
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:00,633
There's one more gimbap. The tuna.

749
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,734
Three.

750
00:52:02,233 --> 00:52:03,900
Fried tofu, tuna, bulgogi.

751
00:52:04,734 --> 00:52:07,633
As usual,
bulgogi should be the most expensive.

752
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,467
Then tuna, then fried tofu.

753
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:10,934
How do you wanna price them?

754
00:52:11,467 --> 00:52:13,033
How much is 150 pesos?

755
00:52:13,467 --> 00:52:14,667
150 is about...

756
00:52:14,734 --> 00:52:15,633
It will be...

757
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,667
-That's almost 10,000 won.
-10,000 won.

758
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:18,834
It's worth that much.

759
00:52:24,200 --> 00:52:25,533
Should we go with 150 then?

760
00:52:26,734 --> 00:52:28,900
Bulgogi will be 150 pesos. And...

761
00:52:28,967 --> 00:52:31,166
-Tuna will be...
-Ten less.

762
00:52:31,233 --> 00:52:32,266
-Ten?
-Yes.

763
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,834
So 140 and 130 pesos each.

764
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,567
Because our gimbap has
a lot more veggies inside.

765
00:52:37,633 --> 00:52:39,967
We're selling
three kinds of gimbap tomorrow.

766
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:43,066
-Okay.
-And prices are 150, 140, 130 pesos.

767
00:52:43,367 --> 00:52:46,834
For the ramyeon...
There's an original one, right?

768
00:52:46,934 --> 00:52:49,400
Seo Jun, how about 100 pesos
for the original one?

769
00:52:54,734 --> 00:52:57,200
I just looked up
the average pasta price here and…

770
00:52:57,266 --> 00:53:01,500
I looked up the price
of pasta place we first went to.

771
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,967
I'm saying 100 is not too expensive.

772
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,667
-So the original ramyeon will be...
-One hundred.

773
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:11,066
How much extra should we charge
for cheese?

774
00:53:11,133 --> 00:53:12,567
Ten or twenty pesos?

775
00:53:13,066 --> 00:53:15,133
-Ten?
-Ten?

776
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:18,033
It's either 1,400 won or 700 won.

777
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:20,133
It should be 700 won.

778
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,700
So just 110 pesos?

779
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:22,767
All right. 110 then.

780
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:28,467
What's your business philosophy
for Jinny's Kitchen?

781
00:53:29,433 --> 00:53:30,834
Profit matters the most.

782
00:53:33,066 --> 00:53:34,734
So you want to make money, huh?

783
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,066
Well…
You run a restaurant

784
00:53:37,133 --> 00:53:38,834
to make money, of course.

785
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:41,900
So we can introduce
Korean food to the world.

786
00:53:41,967 --> 00:53:43,700
This is not a charity.

787
00:53:46,066 --> 00:53:47,133
Think about it.

788
00:53:48,133 --> 00:53:50,333
-And 110 for cheese ramyeon?
-Yes.

789
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,667
Yes, 110 pesos.

790
00:53:52,467 --> 00:53:55,200
There is an original
and cheese tteokbokki.

791
00:53:55,467 --> 00:53:58,333
About the tteokbokki…

792
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,166
How about 150 pesos? Should it be higher?

793
00:54:01,266 --> 00:54:03,066
I think 150 pesos is okay because…

794
00:54:03,133 --> 00:54:05,166
-Should we raise it though?
-Raise it?

795
00:54:05,233 --> 00:54:06,734
Because, tteokbokki is…

796
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,000
It's served with tongs,
forks, and scissors.

797
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:11,000
Understand?

798
00:54:11,266 --> 00:54:13,600
It's served in two plates.

799
00:54:15,633 --> 00:54:19,367
Before, he had…

800
00:54:19,433 --> 00:54:21,166
He had strong opinions too,

801
00:54:21,233 --> 00:54:23,200
but he didn't express them strongly.

802
00:54:23,266 --> 00:54:25,533
-But now…
-Is he being pigheaded?

803
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:27,433
Pigheaded… Yeah, kind of.

804
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,200
He is...

805
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:30,300
Smiling,

806
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:33,400
but at the same time pushing us around.

807
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:39,300
In a way, it's really scary.

808
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,266
Since our tteokbokki comes with fritters…

809
00:54:44,333 --> 00:54:45,266
Exactly.

810
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:46,533
So raise the price?

811
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:47,800
Let's make it 200.

812
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:49,467
Right, the fritters.

813
00:54:49,533 --> 00:54:50,800
I forgot the fritters.

814
00:54:50,867 --> 00:54:53,066
We're serving fritters too.
It should be 200.

815
00:54:53,333 --> 00:54:54,600
Either 180 or 200 pesos.

816
00:54:54,667 --> 00:54:56,000
Then 180 for the original

817
00:54:56,066 --> 00:54:58,100
-and 200 for the one with cheese.
-Good.

818
00:54:58,166 --> 00:55:00,066
Last, the corn dogs.

819
00:55:00,333 --> 00:55:01,266
First…

820
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:04,100
-Make it 80.
-The original one and…

821
00:55:04,166 --> 00:55:05,400
And the rest is 100.

822
00:55:05,467 --> 00:55:07,166
-You say, 80 and 100?
-Yes.

823
00:55:10,133 --> 00:55:12,667
We should consider at least two hours
for tomorrow.

824
00:55:13,467 --> 00:55:15,900
Or how about
Tae Hyung goes one hour earlier?

825
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:17,900
Yes, he could do that.

826
00:55:18,033 --> 00:55:21,166
Before, I made them go to work
earlier than others.

827
00:55:21,266 --> 00:55:23,433
And when Woo Shik comes,
they can both…

828
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,700
Exactly. Then we can go a bit later.

829
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:30,533
You're very strict about seniority here.

830
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:33,967
I thought
you were just all equal colleagues.

831
00:55:34,533 --> 00:55:37,367
Then what's the point
of having job titles?

832
00:55:37,433 --> 00:55:39,633
What's the point of having experience?

833
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,934
That just touched my heart.

834
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,367
Those who have been working hard
deserve some benefits.

835
00:55:46,433 --> 00:55:47,900
Seo Jun's smiling.

836
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:51,066
Well, he does have a point.

837
00:55:51,867 --> 00:55:53,700
If they get there by 9:30 AM...

838
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:55,967
Anyway, they have experience.

839
00:55:56,033 --> 00:55:57,667
And it's something

840
00:55:57,734 --> 00:56:00,133
that should be recognized.

841
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:04,000
What's the point of having
job titles and experience?

842
00:56:04,066 --> 00:56:05,900
Should everyone stay at entry level?

843
00:56:05,967 --> 00:56:07,500
I'm confused.

844
00:56:07,567 --> 00:56:10,533
I'm not sure
if he's a good person or a bad person.

845
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,133
Then when Woo Shik comes,

846
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,033
will he be an intern
and me as a full-time worker?

847
00:56:16,834 --> 00:56:18,934
It doesn't work that way.

848
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,967
I was an intern too my first year here.

849
00:56:21,333 --> 00:56:23,567
Well, who knows?
Woo Shik might be really good

850
00:56:23,633 --> 00:56:25,633
and get a promotion first.

851
00:56:25,700 --> 00:56:27,633
I want them to be competitive.

852
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:29,033
He's not Choi Woo Shik.

853
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,100
Call him Intern Choi.

854
00:56:31,166 --> 00:56:34,467
Woo Shik was nepotism.
He's here thanks to Youn's Stay.

855
00:56:36,367 --> 00:56:38,166
When are you going to work tomorrow?

856
00:56:38,233 --> 00:56:39,533
We have only one car.

857
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,033
What… Are you kidding now?

858
00:56:41,100 --> 00:56:42,433
When there's only one car,

859
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,467
who ride it?
The employees or the boss?

860
00:56:45,500 --> 00:56:47,900
Come on, don't ask such a dumb question.

861
00:56:50,233 --> 00:56:52,133
If it's an employee's car...

862
00:56:54,834 --> 00:56:56,166
Don't you agree?

863
00:56:56,233 --> 00:56:59,166
You can say no if you don't agree.

864
00:56:59,233 --> 00:57:00,767
This is a nightmare!

865
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,233
Say no if you don't agree.

866
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:05,133
Why don't we give one more car?
I'll give you one more.

867
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:06,667
-We have another?
-What is it?

868
00:57:06,734 --> 00:57:08,800
-It's actually ours.
-It was package deal.

869
00:57:08,867 --> 00:57:09,934
We have a Tucson too.

870
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,166
Is that so? Give it to them.

871
00:57:12,233 --> 00:57:14,667
We'll ride the Palisade.

872
00:57:15,734 --> 00:57:16,567
That will work.

873
00:57:16,633 --> 00:57:18,900
But I was on a Pelisade commercial.

874
00:57:18,967 --> 00:57:21,133
I don't care about that.

875
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,133
Everyone agreed to… do you all agree?

876
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,066
-Well, you have a point.
-Right?

877
00:57:26,633 --> 00:57:28,600
You can always say no if you want to.

878
00:57:28,667 --> 00:57:30,500
You can't just make me do all…

879
00:57:31,367 --> 00:57:33,700
Of course,
they should ride the better car.

880
00:57:34,633 --> 00:57:35,600
I'll go.

881
00:57:35,667 --> 00:57:36,967
-An hour early.
-Delivery?

882
00:57:37,033 --> 00:57:37,867
Stop.

883
00:57:37,934 --> 00:57:39,433
I'll be there an hour earlier.

884
00:57:40,266 --> 00:57:42,100
I'll ride a bike there.

885
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:44,500
For a second, I felt completely lost.

886
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,033
Choi Woo Shik, you better be ready.

887
00:58:04,467 --> 00:58:05,800
We're in matching clothes!

888
00:58:07,266 --> 00:58:09,133
-You think?
-Let's button up.

889
00:58:10,133 --> 00:58:12,867
Intern Kim. Get dressed already.

890
00:58:14,133 --> 00:58:16,100
What are you doing?

891
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,300
Today is the grand opening.

892
00:58:18,367 --> 00:58:20,100
Beige. You should wear beige pants.

893
00:58:20,633 --> 00:58:22,900
Beige pants?
But my beige pants have fleece.

894
00:58:22,967 --> 00:58:24,834
-Fleece?
-It's fleece-lined.

895
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:27,934
It doesn't matter.
We must wear beige pants today.

896
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,266
I'll faint.

897
00:58:29,333 --> 00:58:31,133
Put the beige pants on.

898
00:58:31,233 --> 00:58:35,066
Seo Jin.
He's not in beige. He's in navy pants.

899
00:58:35,133 --> 00:58:36,066
Pants? Why?

900
00:58:36,133 --> 00:58:39,767
So I told him to wear beige
and he said it's in fleece.

901
00:58:40,133 --> 00:58:42,934
-I told him to put them on.
-Good.

902
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,367
Hey, that's…

903
00:58:45,433 --> 00:58:47,567
-He can't be wearing that.
-Go get changed.

904
00:58:47,633 --> 00:58:49,433
You can't be wearing them.

905
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:54,734
-Wear those fleece pants.
-Let's go.

906
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:56,934
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

907
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:05,500
-Don't forget the seat belt.
-Okay.

908
00:59:16,967 --> 00:59:19,166
-Should I start the car?
-Let's go.

909
00:59:20,133 --> 00:59:23,967
I wonder what will surprise us today.

910
00:59:35,734 --> 00:59:38,367
-Let's see.
-Oh, we're here.

911
00:59:38,433 --> 00:59:40,400
-Here it is.
-Pull up the car.

912
00:59:45,633 --> 00:59:47,367
-Here we are.
-We're here.

913
00:59:49,033 --> 00:59:51,300
-Going in.
-Going in.

914
00:59:51,367 --> 00:59:54,400
Careful, motorbike coming through.

915
00:59:58,633 --> 01:00:00,133
Was it "Hola?"

916
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:01,500
How do they say hi here?

917
01:00:01,567 --> 01:00:04,033
"Buenos Dias", it's good morning.

918
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,967
You can just say "bueno".

919
01:00:06,033 --> 01:00:08,800
-Bueno.
-Bueno.

920
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,834
Tae Hyung, could you put

921
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,433
the order slips in this order?

922
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:44,700
-Got it.
-That'll make things easier.

923
01:00:52,166 --> 01:00:53,633
I can't see anything.

924
01:00:57,834 --> 01:00:59,700
-What is this?
-You wear it here!

925
01:01:00,333 --> 01:01:01,266
Here.

926
01:01:01,333 --> 01:01:02,533
Put it on your mouth.

927
01:01:05,367 --> 01:01:06,633
Here, on your chin.

928
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:15,166
What a creative mask you have.

929
01:01:17,066 --> 01:01:19,333
Were you doing that to cover your tears?

930
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:21,500
I've never used it before, so…

931
01:01:25,333 --> 01:01:26,667
We'll start with the broth.

932
01:01:55,467 --> 01:01:57,233
Yu Mi, should this be enough?

933
01:01:57,667 --> 01:01:59,367
-Looks good.
-Yea?

934
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:34,500
One slice at a time.

935
01:02:37,834 --> 01:02:40,400
It's like filleting a squid.

936
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:50,133
You should shred lots of carrots, huh?

937
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:51,700
Yes, lots.

938
01:02:51,767 --> 01:02:53,433
Way more than yesterday, right?

939
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,500
Three times as many.

940
01:02:56,266 --> 01:02:58,734
Mr. Park, you've been
through all that too, right?

941
01:02:58,800 --> 01:02:59,633
Of course.

942
01:03:00,066 --> 01:03:02,166
We even did stir-frying.

943
01:03:02,233 --> 01:03:04,066
Back in my days, we didn't have that.

944
01:03:05,266 --> 01:03:06,100
What?

945
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,333
I only used knives back in my days.

946
01:03:10,967 --> 01:03:12,400
My precious babies.

947
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:23,900
When will you open?

948
01:03:23,967 --> 01:03:26,066
It won't go as you planned, right?

949
01:03:26,133 --> 01:03:28,133
No. I don't think we can be ready by 12.

950
01:03:36,967 --> 01:03:38,433
What time then?

951
01:03:39,066 --> 01:03:40,066
One o'clock?

952
01:04:00,233 --> 01:04:02,000
Will you ever finish the shredding?

953
01:04:02,066 --> 01:04:03,967
I can never seem to fill it up.

954
01:04:04,033 --> 01:04:06,066
-Start on the cucumbers.
-Okay.

955
01:04:06,967 --> 01:04:08,000
-Yu Mi.
-Yes!

956
01:04:08,066 --> 01:04:10,934
-Roll some gimbap when you have time.
-Right.

957
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:12,667
-We need display some too.
-Okay.

958
01:04:12,734 --> 01:04:14,333
Seo Jun, is the broth ready yet?

959
01:04:16,567 --> 01:04:19,066
Once it's ready,
you gotta start making tteokbokki.

960
01:04:19,133 --> 01:04:20,200
Right.

961
01:04:20,266 --> 01:04:21,567
Are the corn dogs all set?

962
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:36,300
We can't be tired already.

963
01:04:36,367 --> 01:04:39,967
We can't open until we're ready.

964
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:25,300
The cucumbers are
of much better quality today.

965
01:05:25,367 --> 01:05:27,400
-I drained them.
-Well done.

966
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,033
Thanks.

967
01:05:42,834 --> 01:05:43,900
How many rice cakes?

968
01:05:43,967 --> 01:05:45,867
Yesterday, we decided to use two each.

969
01:05:47,166 --> 01:05:48,433
Let's use 20 and 10 each.

970
01:05:48,900 --> 01:05:51,033
Ten fish cakes and 20 rice cakes.

971
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,333
-Yu Mi.
-Yes.

972
01:06:29,533 --> 01:06:31,433
-Can we finish tteokbokki…
-Yes?

973
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:33,233
-in 30 minutes?
-Let's wait and see.

974
01:06:33,300 --> 01:06:34,800
Well, it's all cooked,

975
01:06:34,867 --> 01:06:36,533
but we need to boil it down.

976
01:06:44,367 --> 01:06:47,533
It's raining.

977
01:07:04,533 --> 01:07:06,166
Why is it raining so much?

978
01:07:06,567 --> 01:07:08,400
Can we even sell food today?

979
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:57,734
Guys.

980
01:07:57,967 --> 01:07:58,800
Are you ready?

981
01:07:59,467 --> 01:08:00,367
Come on out.

982
01:08:00,667 --> 01:08:02,000
The boss is calling us out.

983
01:08:02,166 --> 01:08:03,100
Are we opening now?

984
01:08:03,266 --> 01:08:05,166
Come on. You open it.

985
01:08:05,233 --> 01:08:07,633
-What do I do?
-Flip the open plate over there.

986
01:08:18,133 --> 01:08:19,834
-You flip it.
-Oh, this?

987
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:21,600
-Like this?
-Yes. Flip it.

988
01:08:21,667 --> 01:08:22,934
Change it.

989
01:08:37,433 --> 01:08:39,266
Now, let's start working.

990
01:08:42,500 --> 01:08:43,900
Seo Jin, don't forget this.

991
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:47,000
You really shouldn't forget.

992
01:08:47,066 --> 01:08:49,667
Just stir it whenever you walk by.

993
01:08:53,967 --> 01:08:55,934
-Looks good, right?
-It looks amazing.

994
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:57,734
Tae Hyung did all this.

995
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,467
Whoa, you did lots of work.

996
01:09:13,467 --> 01:09:16,367
We should do some touting
when we don't have customers.

997
01:09:33,033 --> 01:09:34,900
There's a bus coming in.

998
01:09:35,400 --> 01:09:36,734
Customers in groups?

999
01:09:36,800 --> 01:09:38,800
We might have customers in big groups.

1000
01:09:38,867 --> 01:09:40,700
I wish we would.

1001
01:09:44,700 --> 01:09:45,834
It's raining again.

1002
01:09:48,066 --> 01:09:49,033
It's raining again.

1003
01:09:49,467 --> 01:09:52,567
Why does it have to rain so much
on our first day?

1004
01:09:56,834 --> 01:09:58,633
Seriously, rain?

1005
01:10:09,934 --> 01:10:11,333
You've got to be kidding me.

1006
01:10:11,834 --> 01:10:14,567
It was like this then too.
We eventually had customers.

1007
01:10:14,633 --> 01:10:16,266
Well, no one is walking around.

1008
01:10:16,333 --> 01:10:20,000
It was like this last time too.
Way back when we did it.

1009
01:10:20,166 --> 01:10:22,567
And this is
the biggest restaurant we've opened.

1010
01:10:22,633 --> 01:10:24,200
We had such high hopes.

1011
01:10:36,700 --> 01:10:37,767
What do we do?

1012
01:10:37,834 --> 01:10:38,734
What do you mean?

1013
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:40,266
Seo Jin.

1014
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:41,533
No one's coming.

1015
01:10:49,233 --> 01:10:51,367
No one's coming.

1016
01:11:16,667 --> 01:11:18,367
Oh, the rain stopped again.

1017
01:11:28,100 --> 01:11:29,333
Darn it...

1018
01:11:32,433 --> 01:11:33,667
I think they are coming.

1019
01:11:34,767 --> 01:11:37,266
I think I've seen them walk by earlier.

1020
01:11:59,233 --> 01:12:00,133
Hello.

1021
01:12:02,934 --> 01:12:04,900
They must be coming back from swimming.

1022
01:12:08,533 --> 01:12:10,300
What a waste of ingredients.

1023
01:12:11,967 --> 01:12:13,066
Don't say that.

1024
01:12:13,133 --> 01:12:14,400
It's been only one hour.

1025
01:12:14,467 --> 01:12:15,767
-Only one hour?
-Yes.

1026
01:12:15,834 --> 01:12:17,233
-Since we opened?
-Yes.

1027
01:12:36,266 --> 01:12:37,734
-Hello.
-Hello.

1028
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,967
-Hello.
-Hello.

1029
01:12:40,066 --> 01:12:40,900
Hola.

1030
01:12:41,834 --> 01:12:43,533
-Hello.
-Hello.

1031
01:12:45,433 --> 01:12:47,633
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

1032
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:54,900
We have our first customers.

1033
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:57,266
We must…

1034
01:12:57,333 --> 01:12:59,333
-Make them happy.
-A good impression.

1035
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:00,500
The flavor of Korea.

1036
01:13:07,834 --> 01:13:08,667
Here.

1037
01:13:09,834 --> 01:13:10,834
I want to have this.

1038
01:13:12,066 --> 01:13:14,567
Rice cake, fish cake, gochujang…

1039
01:13:15,834 --> 01:13:17,533
I'm gonna order cheese tteokbokki.

1040
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,033
What about you?

1041
01:13:21,467 --> 01:13:22,700
-This one?
-Yes.

1042
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:27,633
One cheese ramyeon and one tteokbokki?

1043
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:29,000
Anything to drink?

1044
01:13:29,066 --> 01:13:31,433
What would you like to drink?

1045
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,100
-Coke?
-Yes.

1046
01:13:33,166 --> 01:13:34,734
-Two cokes please.
-Cokes?

1047
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,333
-Two?
-Yes, two.

1048
01:13:47,934 --> 01:13:48,867
Hola!

1049
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,734
Take this with you. To your table.

1050
01:14:17,734 --> 01:14:18,767
I'll bring it to you.

1051
01:14:20,133 --> 01:14:23,367
Oh, thank you.

1052
01:14:23,433 --> 01:14:26,100
-No, no.
-You want us to put it on our table.

1053
01:14:26,166 --> 01:14:28,033
Thank you.

1054
01:14:37,133 --> 01:14:39,333
Please take it to your table.

1055
01:14:39,500 --> 01:14:41,900
No, I'll bring the food for you.

1056
01:14:45,266 --> 01:14:46,967
-Is this purple?
-It's green.

1057
01:14:47,033 --> 01:14:48,900
-Which one for cheese ramyeon?
-Black.

1058
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:01,166
We keep it on the table.

1059
01:15:01,233 --> 01:15:03,567
On the table? I got it now.

1060
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:12,867
We just ordered food.

1061
01:15:12,934 --> 01:15:14,667
Could you just bring them with you?

1062
01:15:15,266 --> 01:15:18,200
Is it too late to come here for a meal?

1063
01:15:21,300 --> 01:15:22,500
Hello?

1064
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:27,133
Yes, we're sitting inside. Right.

1065
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:31,834
I think it'll be good.

1066
01:15:31,900 --> 01:15:32,834
It looks tasty.

1067
01:15:32,900 --> 01:15:35,367
It's the pasta I talked about earlier.

1068
01:15:35,433 --> 01:15:36,734
What you got for me before?

1069
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,667
Yes, it's what Mom...

1070
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:42,633
They might like it. I think so.

1071
01:15:47,467 --> 01:15:48,767
Intern Kim, are you ready?

1072
01:15:49,100 --> 01:15:50,133
It's our first order.

1073
01:15:59,800 --> 01:16:03,567
I put the soup powder first.

1074
01:16:03,633 --> 01:16:06,000
Because I heard it raises
the boiling point

1075
01:16:06,066 --> 01:16:07,600
and makes the water boil fast.

1076
01:16:08,567 --> 01:16:10,033
Who are you talking to?

1077
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,734
I was talking to the ramyeon.

1078
01:16:20,467 --> 01:16:21,533
The flavor of Korea.

1079
01:16:22,133 --> 01:16:22,967
Let's do this.

1080
01:16:51,533 --> 01:16:53,333
Now is when it tastes the best.

1081
01:16:53,567 --> 01:16:54,667
-Now?
-Yes.

1082
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:14,834
Is this a good amount of sauce?

1083
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,400
Yeah. Looks perfect to me.

1084
01:18:20,333 --> 01:18:21,433
Tae Hyung, here.

1085
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,834
Put the food here and…

1086
01:18:24,934 --> 01:18:25,767
sprinkle.

1087
01:18:55,633 --> 01:18:56,867
-Cut it first.
-Okay.

1088
01:18:58,367 --> 01:18:59,900
-Let me show you.
-Sure.

1089
01:19:20,533 --> 01:19:23,367
-Okay?
-Okay. Thank you.

1090
01:19:23,433 --> 01:19:24,300
Need chopsticks?

1091
01:19:24,367 --> 01:19:25,433
No, I'm good.

1092
01:19:25,500 --> 01:19:26,834
You can use the fork then.

1093
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:27,967
Thank you.

1094
01:19:35,367 --> 01:19:36,700
It smells so good.

1095
01:19:38,633 --> 01:19:40,033
Look at these noodles.

1096
01:19:51,533 --> 01:19:52,734
It's really good!

1097
01:19:54,133 --> 01:19:56,400
-Is it?
-Yes.

1098
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,233
-It's good.
-Yeah?

1099
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,100
Do you wanna try it?

1100
01:20:15,166 --> 01:20:16,967
Try this.

1101
01:20:26,433 --> 01:20:28,433
It tastes like tamarind sauce.

1102
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,467
This one's different.

1103
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:31,967
Try this one too.

1104
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:42,767
It tastes amazing.

1105
01:20:43,834 --> 01:20:45,433
Do you like it?

1106
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:49,400
-No need water?
-It's okay. I like it.

1107
01:20:50,934 --> 01:20:53,367
It's spicy, but really good.

1108
01:20:53,867 --> 01:20:56,533
Do you like everything we ordered?

1109
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:57,433
It's delicious.

1110
01:20:57,500 --> 01:20:59,367
-It's all good, right?
-It's glorious.

1111
01:21:02,233 --> 01:21:03,066
Oh first bite!

1112
01:21:03,834 --> 01:21:05,667
Do you think it's too spicy for them?

1113
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,266
-Mexicans love spicy foods.
-Is that so?

1114
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:12,700
They're not sharing their food.

1115
01:21:12,900 --> 01:21:13,900
They are.

1116
01:21:13,967 --> 01:21:15,467
-They shared tteokbokki.
-What?

1117
01:21:16,300 --> 01:21:17,633
They shared the tteokbokki.

1118
01:21:21,533 --> 01:21:22,667
You guys…

1119
01:21:22,734 --> 01:21:24,500
Have you been peeping from here?

1120
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,567
My eyes hurt.

1121
01:22:11,367 --> 01:22:12,567
-Hola.
-Hola.

1122
01:22:13,900 --> 01:22:15,667
Hola.

1123
01:22:19,934 --> 01:22:21,433
What did you order?

1124
01:22:47,734 --> 01:22:48,967
This one's really good.

1125
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:50,767
I ordered this, Paul.

1126
01:22:52,633 --> 01:22:53,467
It's tasty.

1127
01:22:57,834 --> 01:23:01,033
I'd like to get this one. Gimbap?

1128
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,967
And? What else?

1129
01:23:03,033 --> 01:23:05,700
-This one.
-This one? Okay.

1130
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:08,233
Hello?

1131
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:13,500
No, I am at the restaurant now.

1132
01:23:13,567 --> 01:23:14,934
Where are you now?

1133
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:19,633
Just drive straight. I'll head out.

1134
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,100
Hi!

1135
01:23:33,166 --> 01:23:34,133
It's been a while.

1136
01:23:34,200 --> 01:23:36,433
I haven't seen you for thousands of years.

1137
01:23:42,400 --> 01:23:45,333
We have five customers.

1138
01:23:47,467 --> 01:23:48,734
We have five customers!

1139
01:23:49,066 --> 01:23:50,800
I think now I know how to eat this.

1140
01:23:51,767 --> 01:23:53,633
-You cut it in pieces.
-It's so new.

1141
01:24:00,367 --> 01:24:02,633
-You cut it with the scissors.
-Where?

1142
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:07,133
You pick up the long stuff
and cut it with the scissors.

1143
01:24:13,433 --> 01:24:14,867
We have one bulgogi gimbap.

1144
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:22,066
-Half-and-half and cheese ramyeon.
-Cheese ramyeon.

1145
01:24:27,633 --> 01:24:28,567
My babies…

1146
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:31,600
My babies.

1147
01:25:04,066 --> 01:25:04,900
At last!

1148
01:26:09,533 --> 01:26:10,900
-How is it going?
-Good.

1149
01:26:25,333 --> 01:26:26,367
Chopsticks?

1150
01:26:26,433 --> 01:26:27,333
Yes, please.

1151
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:40,300
-Do you know how to use chopsticks?
-Yes.

1152
01:26:40,367 --> 01:26:41,567
My dad doesn't.

1153
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:45,867
You're fat.

1154
01:26:47,633 --> 01:26:49,667
I'm fat and happy.

1155
01:26:49,734 --> 01:26:51,200
Let me take a photo of your food.

1156
01:26:54,567 --> 01:26:55,633
Enjoy your food!

1157
01:26:55,700 --> 01:26:56,900
Thanks!

1158
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,567
Thank you.

1159
01:27:53,633 --> 01:27:55,000
Is that all you ordered?

1160
01:27:55,066 --> 01:27:57,600
No. He ordered more.
We'll share that.

1161
01:27:57,667 --> 01:27:58,700
You fatty!

1162
01:28:00,066 --> 01:28:01,834
It looks delicious.

1163
01:28:17,433 --> 01:28:18,300
I wanna try this.

1164
01:28:18,367 --> 01:28:19,467
Dad.

1165
01:28:20,533 --> 01:28:23,367
-Go on, fatty.
-I will, fatty.

1166
01:28:36,233 --> 01:28:39,533
Look. There's a sausage and cheese inside.

1167
01:28:39,600 --> 01:28:40,600
You're right.

1168
01:28:40,667 --> 01:28:41,967
It tastes really good.

1169
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:04,033
Things are going quite well.

1170
01:29:04,867 --> 01:29:07,900
He's suddenly looking happy.

1171
01:29:07,967 --> 01:29:09,500
We started to make money.

1172
01:29:29,133 --> 01:29:31,266
It's good.

1173
01:29:51,000 --> 01:29:54,033
I'm gonna try using these.

1174
01:30:05,367 --> 01:30:06,367
It's spicy but good.

1175
01:30:23,967 --> 01:30:25,200
Is it too spicy for you?

1176
01:30:25,367 --> 01:30:26,633
No, it's perfect.

1177
01:30:26,700 --> 01:30:27,567
It's good spicy!

1178
01:30:30,734 --> 01:30:31,600
It's really good.

1179
01:30:33,166 --> 01:30:34,800
I should come back here tomorrow.

1180
01:30:35,834 --> 01:30:37,467
You really like it, don't you?

1181
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:39,367
It's really good.

1182
01:30:42,934 --> 01:30:44,400
-Do they like the food?
-What?

1183
01:30:44,467 --> 01:30:46,567
-The reaction.
-I think they like the food.

1184
01:30:49,467 --> 01:30:50,533
Then…

1185
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:52,667
-Leaving already?
-We must get going.

1186
01:30:52,734 --> 01:30:53,767
Going back to work.

1187
01:30:53,834 --> 01:30:54,934
He should go to work.

1188
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:58,633
If only I could live off rent
just like your father…

1189
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:03,066
See you maybe next week.

1190
01:31:04,233 --> 01:31:05,867
Goodbye. Thank you.

1191
01:31:09,166 --> 01:31:10,667
Gracias.

1192
01:31:12,367 --> 01:31:13,734
Hasta luego.

1193
01:31:31,233 --> 01:31:33,734
Hey, chefs don't do washing.

1194
01:31:33,800 --> 01:31:36,100
-Move, let me do it.
-I'm almost done.

1195
01:31:36,166 --> 01:31:37,000
Yeah?

1196
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:07,166
You said Korean food was popular.

1197
01:32:07,333 --> 01:32:09,300
-Sorry?
-Korean food is popular?

1198
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,233
London is crazy about Korean food.

1199
01:32:12,300 --> 01:32:14,367
-Next is Mexico.
-When is it gonna happen?

1200
01:32:14,433 --> 01:32:16,367
No one seems interested.

1201
01:32:16,433 --> 01:32:18,333
Things are going quite well.

1202
01:32:18,400 --> 01:32:21,433
Why are you giving me false hope?

1203
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:26,633
-It will get big.
-Goodness.

1204
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:28,767
Why are there so many fritters?

1205
01:32:32,166 --> 01:32:35,433
-This is a complete minus.
-It's two packs of dumplings.

1206
01:32:35,500 --> 01:32:37,567
Why did you open two packs of dumplings?

1207
01:32:37,633 --> 01:32:41,233
You're the one who pushed them to work.

1208
01:32:44,834 --> 01:32:46,867
Why don't the four of us sit
on the table?

1209
01:32:46,967 --> 01:32:48,500
Sounds good. Let's do that.

1210
01:32:48,567 --> 01:32:51,000
I think people aren't coming
since it's so empty.

1211
01:32:59,967 --> 01:33:02,233
Seriously, there's nobody walking around.

1212
01:33:02,333 --> 01:33:03,867
Why aren't there anyone today?

1213
01:33:05,967 --> 01:33:07,033
Let's close today.

1214
01:33:08,300 --> 01:33:10,567
-What time is it?
-It's 5:10 PM.

1215
01:33:12,333 --> 01:33:14,266
Aren't we staying until sunset?

1216
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:16,700
The business is going so slow.

1217
01:33:16,767 --> 01:33:17,700
This…

1218
01:33:17,767 --> 01:33:18,934
won't work.

1219
01:33:19,000 --> 01:33:22,433
We're supposed to have
one customer after another.

1220
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:29,000
Zero interest.

1221
01:33:31,033 --> 01:33:33,000
They are not interested at all.

1222
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:37,266
Should we open at one or two tomorrow?

1223
01:33:37,333 --> 01:33:38,400
I'm so worried.

1224
01:33:39,066 --> 01:33:40,166
By the way…

1225
01:33:46,734 --> 01:33:47,767
By the way,

1226
01:33:49,967 --> 01:33:51,233
how much is our salary?

1227
01:33:53,066 --> 01:33:56,133
Have you lost your mind?

1228
01:33:56,233 --> 01:33:58,266
I just got really curious.

1229
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:00,934
Let's wait and see until the sunset.

1230
01:34:02,266 --> 01:34:03,333
We've prepared a lot.

1231
01:34:04,333 --> 01:34:06,000
When people pass by…

1232
01:34:09,066 --> 01:34:10,133
Oh, are they coming?

1233
01:34:12,033 --> 01:34:14,500
I think someone's coming. One group.

1234
01:34:15,734 --> 01:34:17,400
I think they're coming.

1235
01:34:20,533 --> 01:34:21,834
They're coming in.

1236
01:34:21,900 --> 01:34:22,734
Really?

1237
01:34:23,533 --> 01:34:24,567
Did they come in?

1238
01:34:24,633 --> 01:34:26,667
-They're down below.
-Looking at the menu.

1239
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:44,266
-Hello.
-Hello.

1240
01:34:44,333 --> 01:34:45,467
Good afternoon.

1241
01:34:45,533 --> 01:34:47,700
We just opened, and customers are coming.

1242
01:34:47,767 --> 01:34:49,600
Maybe we'll end up having 15 groups.

1243
01:34:49,934 --> 01:34:51,400
Here comes the customers!

1244
01:34:52,533 --> 01:34:53,834
We have more customers.

1245
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,033
More people are coming,
what do we do?

1246
01:34:58,767 --> 01:35:01,000
Today is a tough day for Yu Mi.

1247
01:35:01,066 --> 01:35:02,800
They all ordered gimbap.

1248
01:35:02,867 --> 01:35:03,934
Bulgogi gimbap, right?

1249
01:35:04,000 --> 01:35:06,266
-Bulgogi gimbap.
-You too? All right.

1250
01:35:06,567 --> 01:35:09,133
Gimbap de bulgogi?

1251
01:35:09,200 --> 01:35:11,533
-Bulgogi? One?
-Yes, one.

1252
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:12,967
Two bulgogis?

1253
01:35:13,900 --> 01:35:16,066
All right, Jung Yu Mi. Use your brain.

1254
01:35:18,333 --> 01:35:19,934
Way too many gimbap orders.

1255
01:35:20,166 --> 01:35:22,533
Bulgogi… I can't do this.

1256
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:23,567
Is this purple too?

1257
01:35:23,633 --> 01:35:24,967
Yes, purple.

1258
01:35:25,033 --> 01:35:27,467
No, wait. It's green.

1259
01:35:27,533 --> 01:35:29,367
One extra cheese ramyeon, right?

1260
01:35:29,433 --> 01:35:31,767
-No, purple is first.
-Right?

1261
01:35:35,834 --> 01:35:38,166
Whoa, I can't get it together.

1262
01:35:38,233 --> 01:35:41,834
-Tae Hyung.
-Yes?

1263
01:35:41,900 --> 01:35:43,000
Seo Jun.

1264
01:35:43,066 --> 01:35:44,633
He seems exhausted already.

1265
01:35:44,700 --> 01:35:46,600
Did Woo Shik take the bus?

1266
01:35:47,667 --> 01:35:49,567
I miss Woo Shik today.

1267
01:35:50,500 --> 01:35:52,166
Jinny's Kitchen.

1268
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:58,500
Woo Shik, go to the kitchen now.

1269
01:35:58,567 --> 01:36:00,567
What do I do…

1270
01:36:00,633 --> 01:36:02,734
-Woo Shik, this too.
-Sure.

1271
01:36:03,667 --> 01:36:06,100
Woo Shik, this is for the two elders.

1272
01:36:06,166 --> 01:36:09,533
While I was away,
you guys became similar.

1273
01:36:10,166 --> 01:36:12,100
You'll be like us tomorrow.

1274
01:36:12,166 --> 01:36:14,333
Hopefully I can fit in here.

1275
01:36:55,500 --> 01:36:58,667
JINNY'S KITCHEN
