Hello, I'm an AI robot.
My name is Nam Shin I.

Shin.

00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,231

00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:36,156
I can never get bored of applause,
I feel like I'm a superstar.

13
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:46,416
This child is the best AI version
until now, but we can do even better.

14
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:48,126
Soon enough,

it will be able to bring to you
someone who's far away.

16
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:58,803
There will be many cute robots you won't
be able to differentiate from humans.

17
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,555
That's not true!

18
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,813
I'm not a robot, I'm a human!

19
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:11,357
Yes, you're human.

20
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,112
He's my seven year-old son.

21
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:20,950
I wish he was a behaving robot sometimes.

22
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,494
I told you to sit quietly.

23
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:26,539
I'm a human who never listens.
Continue, Mother.

24
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:35,798
Don't do it again, or I'll clone a robot
and I'll only love him.

25
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:38,301
It's okay, I like Daddy more.

26
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,391
Are you upset that I said
I like Daddy more?

27
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:49,062
Not at all.
Because Daddy loves me much more.

28
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,066
Who said that?
Can you read his mind?

29
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,694
Then why don't you ask him?

30
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,366
He will be here soon.
Let's fly home soon.

31
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,161
I'll call him and ask.

32
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,460
It's Daddy's ringtone. 

33
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,233
Who are you?

34
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,026
What is it?

35
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,570
-No!
-Let me go!

36
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,407
-Let me go!
-Shin! No, let me go!

37
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,075
-Mom!
-Shin!

38
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:45,785
Mom...

39
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,412
Shin!

40
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,874
Shin! No, let me go!

41
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,631
Let go of me!

42
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,968
I'm sorry to surprise you like this.

43
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:04,178
The president wants to see Shin.

44
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:05,596
Why?

45
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,808
He never approved of me
as his daughter-in-law.

46
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,519
So I'm living quietly outside of Korea.

47
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,439
I'm sorry.

48
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,733
I'm only here in Korea for one forum.

49
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,527
We won't be back with my husband
if we leave this time.

50
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:25,033
Isn't that my husband's phone?

51
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,327
Why do you have that?

52
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,004
What is it?

53
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,674
His death confirmation.

54
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:45,011
The funeral was held last night.

55
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,515
Funeral...

56
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,269
You're saying he's dead?

57
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,521
He killed himself.

58
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,814
Why would he?

59
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:01,027
He just said he'd visit his father
for a few days.

60
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:06,366
My son, Shin...
No, no.

61
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:10,620
Shin! No! 

62
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,206
Let me go!

63
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,508
The president said he'll take care
of his own grandson.

64
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:28,179
Please check your bank account.
You're well compensated.

65
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:56,249
Dear...

66
00:06:58,709 --> 00:07:00,962
You must be lonely there.

67
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:11,264
Our Shin must be so lonely,

68
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:13,558
just like you are now.

69
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,578
Don't worry.

70
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,373
I'll get him back.

71
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:36,682
What good is this money?
That's all that's left after buying a car.

72
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,895
If you give me more, I'll just break in
again with a more expensive car.

73
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,273
Surprising.

74
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:48,945
I thought you would be crippled
with grief for your husband.

75
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:53,199
Shin! Mom's here. Come out!

76
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,118
I'm here to get you.

77
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,539
Don't touch anything here
and just come out. 

78
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,666
-Let's go home.
-Mom.

79
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,338
Shin!

80
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,215
Shin.

81
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,511
Shin, are you okay?

82
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:15,012
Are you feeling okay?

83
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:19,642
I've been worried sick about you.
I've missed you so much.

84
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,520
I'm not going with you.

85
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:23,729
I like it here better.

86
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,815
I'll live here with my grandfather.

87
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:27,650
What are you talking about?

88
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,777
Did someone say something?

89
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,071
Did they threaten you?

90
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,906
It's not that.

91
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,826
Then why? Come with me.

92
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,995
I don't want to die like Dad!

93
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:40,621
What?

94
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,498
He died because of you.

95
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:47,128
Who said that? Who would say--

96
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:51,007
I just know it.
He had a hard time because of you.

97
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,009
Shin.

98
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:57,638
I'm not going with you.
So never come back, or I'll die.

99
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,686
Shin!

100
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:05,896

101
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,608
Shin...

102
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,276
Let me go!

103
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,736
Shin!

104
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:13,738
Shin!
Let me go...

105
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,623
I did as promised.

106
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:27,376
Now you won't do anything to her?

107
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:29,837
Of course not.

108
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:37,261
Let me go, Shin!

109
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,774
I'll take my son. Get out of the way.

110
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,942
Don't ruin Shin, too.

111
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,529
What?

112
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:58,240
Is there anything the president can't do?

113
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:02,703
Did you see what happened to Jung-woo
after going against him?

114
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:09,752
Isn't it more important to keep him alive
than keep him next to you?

115
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,632
Could you handle
if anything were to happen to Shin

116
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,759
because of your arrogance?

117
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,120
Would you like some light?

118
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:35,254
Mom, I'm scared. Mom.

119
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:40,134
Shin, are you okay? May I come in?

120
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,095
Don't come in!

00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,570
Wait.

185
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:55,118
Everyone will be surprised
to know your scam.

186
00:24:56,495 --> 00:25:01,374
Who would think that the security
is selling his picture.

187
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,462
But it's my first time
using a hidden camera. I'm scared.

188
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:07,047
Nervous?

189
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,883
You always rub that necklace when you are.

190
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,180
Installation complete.

191
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,310
Now he's on the girl groups
moving on from the actresses.

192
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,021
New face, it's double.

193
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,774
-New face, double!
-Call.

194
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:28,860
I'll get going.

195
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:33,990
This stupid old car.

196
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,037
I broke the camera and paid off
the paparazzi.

197
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,372
Good job.

198
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,208
What trash,
living off secretive photography.

199
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:48,088
They're all trash with no hope.

200
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:51,716
You're human only when you work
honestly to earn.

201
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,136
That's your philosophy,
you tought us that.

202
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,013
I respect that.

203
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:58,932
Thanks for your work.

204
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,184
-Go.
-Sure.

205
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,501
Now he's on the girl groups
moving on from the actresses.

206
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,629
New face, it's double.

207
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,814
Oh my goodness.

208
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,692
Isn't she a member of "Girl Crush"?

209
00:26:55,905 --> 00:27:01,453
Guard the VIP's private life
as your own. Look straight.

210
00:27:01,536 --> 00:27:02,621
Yes, Ma'am.

211
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,480
I have to go to the restroom.

212
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,487
Yes.

213
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:57,050
A camera that looks like a watch.

214
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:59,052
It's funny.

215
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,474
Please don't misunderstand.
This is from that paparazzi...

216
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:10,438
Are you the security?

217
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:15,235
You've been selling me off.
You've posted all those pics online.

218
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,905
You really got me wrong.
Don't accuse me for nothing.

219
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,031
Accuse you?

220
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,950
How dare you.

221
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,788
You've done it before.
I had to kiss that girl to catch you.

222
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:29,582
I didn't.

223
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,751
It must be that paparazzi--

224
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:35,171
Do you think it's funny?
How dare you lie to my face?

225
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,765
What are you all looking at?

226
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:50,270
Do you also want to make
money off my picture? Then take it.

227
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,981
What a bad ass.

228
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,190
What did you say?

229
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,320
Turn that camera on, take more.

230
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:01,656
Take it.

231
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:04,409
Excuse me.

232
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,709
-Don't take it.
-What the...

233
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,588
Get all these people out!

234
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,923
Please stop taking photos.

235
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,801
It's mine.

236
00:29:27,766 --> 00:29:28,808
Don't take any photos.

237
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:33,980
We'll discuss this later.
Where's the general manager?

238
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,819
I'm not taking any.

239
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:46,034
He went in to catch the flight.
It's on his was to Los Angeles.

240
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:19,901
Hello?

241
00:30:20,026 --> 00:30:21,402
Guess who?

242
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,656
Where are you?

243
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:27,659
I'm on the plane, with you.

244
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,285
Stop playing around.

245
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:32,914
Here's a hint. I see white clouds.

246
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,291
Just white clouds.

247
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,585
You're on a different plane.

248
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,629
Fine, but please
finish the presentation first.

249
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:43,842
I like planes more than cars.
I can go further.

250
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,635
Where the heck are you going?

251
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,429
-If the president finds--
-Check social media yet.

252
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,641
I'm the hideous woman hater now.

253
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:56,020
If I hold the company's
self-driving car presentation,

254
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,147
it'll ruin the business.

255
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,776
I'll disappear for the company.

256
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:05,238
That sly old man and that snake
of a director will welcome it, too.

257
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:09,492
You can also stop this game
of hide-and-seek.

258
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:15,290
I told you to protect him,
and you took pictures of him?

259
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:21,462
You put the entire team at risk
and embarrassed them.

260
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:25,717
You don't care about the team's
reputation, only your money!

261
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,594
Please stop.

262
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,062
Please fire her.

263
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:41,983
Send notification to block her
from any further security work.

264
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:45,612
Otherwise you'll do the same
to other teams.

265
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,948
I hope I don't see you again.

266
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:49,908
Let's go.

267
00:32:01,878 --> 00:32:02,879
Here.

268
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,757
What is it?

269
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:07,467
The camera.

270
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,723
I got fired, I can't afford that.

271
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,600
What will you do?

272
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,769
It's all because of me.

273
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:20,438
I didn't reject it.

274
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:25,652
I fell for the money. Don't be sorry.

275
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,905
I feel bad.

276
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,991
Don't worry. I can protect a rich dog.

277
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:34,911
Bye.

278
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,498
So-bong.

279
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,625
So-bong!

280
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:55,723
Yes, sir.

281
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:03,022
No, she didn't recognize at all.

282
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,403
But why did you hit her?

283
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,907
You knew that she'd take the pictures.

284
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:17,662
I feel so bad that I lied to her.

285
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,624
If she finds out, I'm dead.

286
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,293
And she also got fired...

287
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:26,838
Hello?

288
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,649
-Yes, sir?
-Water, please.

289
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:47,692
Sure.

290
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,538
We've put a tail on him.

291
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:04,584
Shin is on a plane to Czech.

292
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,919
One of our guys is in that plane.

293
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:11,132
It's good that we had
his second ticket information.

294
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,510
Why is he going there?

295
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:19,974
Anyway, don't lose him again.

296
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:21,350
Of course.

297
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:29,484
Now it's your stage,
where the president used to stand.

298
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,282
The grandson of a wealthy businessman
violently hit a woman...

299
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,950
I'm so sorry.

300
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:43,539
I was too busy preparing the presentation
and I forgot about his flight.

301
00:34:44,373 --> 00:34:48,377
How could he do this? Or did he intend
to bring the company down?

302
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:53,424
He did it on purpose.
He'll come back after a while.

303
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:55,510
So it's okay?

304
00:34:57,178 --> 00:35:00,139
She took his photo without consent.
She had an issue.

305
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,558
So we can hit her?

306
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:04,685
Then...

307
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:07,105
why didn't he just bury her?

308
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:12,944
I'm sure it was from the pressure
of the presentation.

309
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:15,321
It's not just a regular presentation.

310
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:20,535
It's the representative presentation
for the PK Group.

311
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,664
It's my fault that I didn't realize
the pressure he was under.

312
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,297
I deserve to die, President.

313
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:37,385
It's your fault. Please stop acting.

314
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,221
It looks like you're making
a debut for a movie.

315
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,483
You don't know your fiancé's whereabouts?

316
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:54,068
Why do you sound so proud?

317
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:57,989
He'll come back, I don't
control him as old people do.

318
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,408
We'll push tomorrow's presentation.

319
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,745
What about the meeting in an hour
regarding the presentation?

320
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,207
I'll go in myself.

321
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:11,127
Please leave.

322
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,270
Wait.

323
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:36,402
May I ask who's your father?
I thought that was me.

324
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,196
Of course, it's you.

325
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:43,701
Then why would you say,
"It's your fault. Stop acting"?

326
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:48,289
I'm telling you not to dream about it
when Shin isn't here.

327
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,291
He's your insurance.

328
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:53,920
He'll make you
the wealthy family's father-in-law.

329
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:57,840
I know, but don't be suspicious
of your own father.

330
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:02,470
I feel like I devoted my life here
for nothing.

331
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,768
Was I too mean?

332
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,687
Wait for me, Director.

333
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:34,502
Are you crazy?

334
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,713
Why did you break the TV?

335
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,216
It was the only thing working here.

336
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,759
Do you even have eyes?

337
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:45,513
-Look, it's the work of Trainer Kang.
-He did this?

338
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:50,893
Of course, he was watching the news
where you got hit, then...

339
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,854
Who was on the news?

340
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:59,485
You. Even with the cover up,
he knew it was his daughter.

341
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,904
He became so mad.

342
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:03,906
Then what? Where?

343
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,324
PK Group, of course.

344
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,457
Get off!

345
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:17,461
I need his apology before I leave.

346
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,631
Nam Shin is out of the country.
He's not here.

347
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,469
Then forget him. Bring his grandfather.

348
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,889
His grandfather is the president
of this company.

349
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,059
So what? What about it?

350
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:36,355
I'm here as her dad.

351
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:40,985
I always taught her not to show off
her skills.

352
00:38:41,068 --> 00:38:43,612
Nor abuse anyone with her power.

353
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:48,200
Let me hear what this president
has taught his grandson.

354
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,912
Did he teach his grandson
to show off his power and money?

355
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:56,292
Did he tell him it's okay to treat people
that way?

356
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,087
Trainer Kang, this won't help So-bong.

357
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:10,639
My So-bong sidestepped
just once after she lost her mother.

358
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,851
Other than that,
she has been working very hard.

359
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:18,230
She also got this job not for the money

360
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:22,902
but for her sense of duty
to protect a person.

361
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:24,737
Dad!

362
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:31,702
Let's go.

363
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,372
After they apologize.

364
00:39:34,789 --> 00:39:36,791
We should get an apology from her.

365
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:38,834
Isn't that right?

366
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,547
I'm sorry.

367
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:45,841
Dad, please go.

368
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:49,095
Wait, stop this!

369
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:54,975
What did you just say?
Why should she apologize?

370
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,437
Is this how you people roll?

371
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:03,275
So-bong got hit for secretively
taking his photo.

372
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,403
And she got fired, too.

373
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,864
Wait.

374
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,494
Secret photo? Is it true?

375
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:17,790
Did you really take that kind of picture?

376
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:23,462
Didn't you say she was diligent
and not interested in money?

377
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,174
You raised a different child, then.

378
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,461
Dad.

379
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,056
What the...

380
00:41:18,017 --> 00:41:20,019
This is so annoying!

381
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:26,901
The grandson of a wealthy business
group hit a female security guard

382
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:31,280
and the footage is all over social media.
Misuse of power is again the hot topic.

383
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:35,576
Get ready, as you will see
more entertainment.

384
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:47,505
He had many scandals
with actresses and girl groups.

385
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:52,635
With his violence, society is asking
rich people to take responsibility.

386
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,512
This is Hwa-jin from YTV.

387
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:07,274
Isn't the meeting starting?

388
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,400
Yes.

389
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:10,819
Why isn't he coming out?

390
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,572
Dad!

391
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,208
Dad.

392
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,751
Are you upset?

393
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,712
Don't worry. I'm here for you.

394
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:32,675
Your daughter is here to be with you
even with the divorce.

395
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,805
Where's Jung-woo?

396
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,558
Jung-woo?

397
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:43,060
He's dead.

398
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,230
Dead?

399
00:42:46,313 --> 00:42:48,023
What's wrong?

400
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:50,276
I disregarded him as my son.

401
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:55,155
But you cannot treat him as if he's dead
when he's very much alive!

402
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,995
What do you mean, he alive?
He's been dead for over 20 years.

403
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,079
Shut your mouth!

404
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:04,832
Please calm down.

405
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:06,750
Oh my gosh.

406
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:08,877
Please take him to the parking lot.

407
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:12,631
Please take him to Dr. Lee.

408
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,009
Let's go. Go.

409
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:18,095
Please find Jung-woo.

410
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,805
I'll take care of it from here.

411
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,016
Let's go.

412
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,033
Where is he going?

413
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:41,577
He must be shocked from the news.

414
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,747
He wanted to take a break.

415
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,750
You can lead the meeting, he said.

416
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,419
I'll take him home, then.

417
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,138
Let me go! Jung-woo!

418
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,139
Sir, please!

419
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,932
Please bring him back!

420
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,393
-Please, Dad.
-Get off!

421
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:08,312
Jung-woo!

422
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:31,168
Is he okay?

423
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:33,587
He just went off.

424
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,718
We've had a call from the Czech Republic.
He just landed.

425
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:51,313
CZECH KARLOVY VARY

426
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:02,509
Today's toast is so good.
Can I have one more?

427
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,512
Too many calories.

428
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:10,058
Never mind. I'll drink more coffee.

429
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,060
Too much caffeine.

430
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,774
You want to go that quickly?

431
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:20,235
I shouldn't bring you to the market
twice or you'll starve me.

432
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,406
It's David. You should go.

433
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,866
Sure.

434
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,662
Don't let people find out.
You know better.

435
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:34,458
Not that nagging again.
I'll take care of things here.

436
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:53,143
-Hi, my son.
-Don't call me that, I'm not your son.

437
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,647
Come on, I made most of your body.

438
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:01,777
You're like the son I made with Laura
with our hearts.

439
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,696
Dr. Laura has no intention of making
a baby with you.

440
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:07,491
Mother, please sit in the back.
I'll sit there.

441
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:25,050
I'm the one who convinced her
to bring you to the market.

442
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,053
-I can just leave you here alone.
-Let's go.

443
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:33,809
Okay.

444
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,854
Let's go!

445
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,198
You're going too fast.

446
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:50,701
You have to keep to the speed limit.

447
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:54,162
Don't worry about it. I'm not your Dad.

448
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,123
David!

449
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,214
Laura Oh, can you get it?

450
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:06,633
Her name is Laura Oh.

451
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:12,931
The name is spelled L-A-U-R-A O-H.

452
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:17,144
An Asian woman has been spotted around.
I'll find out more. Meet me at the market.

453
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:38,373
I'm in front of his hotel.
Nothing special.

454
00:48:39,291 --> 00:48:43,086
Please make sure he doesn't coming back.

455
00:48:44,129 --> 00:48:46,548
What's my limit here?

456
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,979
I'll choose this tonight.

457
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:03,774
It's the color of blood.

458
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:08,695
Murder or accident.

459
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,281
Make it clean.

460
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,787
You'll hear good news soon.

461
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:51,154
You've never seen this many people.
How do you feel?

462
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,365
No one cares about me.

463
00:49:53,865 --> 00:49:55,867
I must look like a human.

464
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:58,161
Let's cross.

465
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:16,471
What are you doing?

466
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,432
Did you just hack this?

467
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,269
Did you teach him this?

468
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,771
Why would I?
He's 100 times smarter than me.

469
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:25,939
David.

470
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:29,359
We'll be late for grocery shopping!

471
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:01,975
This is not 200 grams, it's less.

472
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:07,272
This hand has been working with cheese
and ham for over 30 years

473
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:12,652
and is as good as the scales.
And this hand works with the money.

474
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,322
No, Mom! There's 50 grams less.

475
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,824
How can you tell?

476
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:20,827
Don't tell me you can
weigh stuff with your hand.

477
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,287
I think you're a cheater!

478
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,288
How dare you!

479
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:27,501
Of course, the bacon could have shrunk.
Could you even it up for me?

480
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,212
No problem.

481
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:35,550
Bye.

482
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:37,094
Don't say anything.

483
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:38,678
I told you not to get discovered.

484
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,224
He did a great job. Don't worry.

485
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,518
I'm so proud of him now.

486
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:51,274
I brought you to the market,
so do me a favor.

487
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:56,279
Leave us alone for one hour so we can
go on a date. See you at the car.

488
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,283
And buy a bouquet of flowers for her.

489
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,996
Shin said he has something to buy.

490
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,166
-Let him take care of himself.
-No way.

491
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:11,044
-Come here.
-Later.

492
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,087
Shin.

493
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:21,998
I got it. I'll give you the address,
meet me soon.

494
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:25,460
I got a tail. Throw away all my stuff
at the hotel.

495
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:29,047
Don't release that address.
I'll call you in Korea.

496
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,015
Shin should be here soon.

497
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,433
We still have 10 minutes.

498
00:58:41,434 --> 00:58:43,436
He'll be here exactly on time.

499
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,913
You look great with flowers.

500
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,541
This is on the house.

501
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:08,169
-No.
-I'm sorry?

502
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,004
I only have to get a bunch.

503
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:12,799
Okay, then here's my number.

504
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,469
I'm always here.

505
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:17,804
I don't need paper.

506
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:21,683
I have 5 minutes and 37 seconds.

507
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:23,893
Thank you.

508
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:29,941
What was that all about?

509
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:26,117
Director Suh...

510
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:29,579
He'll do anything to take over.
Shin must come back.

511
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:33,791
Protect Shin's position going to Seoul.

512
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:36,836
Now you really look like Shin.

513
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:42,717
Am I your toy, throwing me away
after you're finished playing?

514
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:45,052
If you cry, I hug.

515
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,890
Hurry, go!

516
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:51,559
It's dangerous. Don't go in.

517
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:55,938
