1
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:35,952
Let me out!

2
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:37,537
Let me out of here!

3
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,091
This is all your fault.

4
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,969
I'll return to being a slave again.

5
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,013
Goodbye for real,

6
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:57,390
So-bong.

7
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,017
You're just a robot.

8
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,561
Why did you have to look at me like that?

9
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,272
But...

10
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,442
why am I thinking of you now?

11
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,995
Okay. Please take your seats.

12
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,705
We'll begin soon.

13
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:37,013
PLEASE GET RID OF THE FILE
ON THE DESK 

14
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,390
IN THE SELF-DRIVING CAR
DEPARTMENT

15
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:46,606
You have no idea where I am, do you?

16
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,237
I'm sure...

17
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:53,822
you can't come.

18
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,503
I'm the crazy one...

19
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,338
for hoping you'd come.

20
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,226
It's me, So-bong.

21
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,892
I'm here now.

22
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,896
I'm sorry I'm late.

23
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:13,086
Isn't he carrying the dashcam?

24
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,090
What happened to the car?

25
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,800
Did you...

26
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,845
The dashcam probably recorded you.

27
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:26,182
We have to get it
before he gives it to Mr. Suh. Let's go.

28
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,270
So-bong.

29
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:32,855
I'm fine. You need to go.

30
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,440
Get on my back. You need a doctor.

31
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,317
There's no time for that.

32
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,861
I'll stay here, so go.

33
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,323
We'll lose him!

34
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:44,075
Please.

35
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:46,911
I'll be right back.

36
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,167
-Hello.
-Let's go.

37
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,544
-Where to?
-Just go!

38
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:55,712
Okay.

39
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,804
Mr. Park. It's me.

40
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,015
Mr. Nam came.

41
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,935
He isn't human.
He can't be human.

42
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:39,797
Step on it. If you don't want
to die, step on it!

43
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,762
Make a left up there. Turn left!

44
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,697
Stop... Stop at the crosswalk over there.

45
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,501
Why that...

46
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,713
Start the car!

47
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:50,910
There's been an accident.
Send an ambulance.

48
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,511
What's going on?

49
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,947
The ambulance will be here soon.

50
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,992
Just what...

51
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,287
in the world are you?

52
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,245
My grandson must be back

53
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,039
to his bratty ways.

54
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,333
This isn't happening today,

55
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,960
so we'll invite you all again soon.

56
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,671
It won't be too long.

57
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,634
-What's going on?
-What a mess.

58
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,136
-What a waste of time.
-Exactly.

59
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,645
Ye-na.

60
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,648
Ye-na.

61
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,900
I owe you...

62
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,402
a debt for life.

63
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,906
Blame me for raising him like that.

64
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,324
It's okay, Grandpa.

65
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,118
I've waited long for him already.

66
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,037
Who cares about the wedding date?

67
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,875
Let's go. Everyone will be
uncomfortable if I'm here.

68
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,601
I won't say anything stupid
to my dad, so don't worry.

69
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,479
I'll always be on Shin's side.

70
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:26,232
Something stupid?

71
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,652
That I won't marry him or
something like that.

72
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,557
So-bong!

73
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,267
I'm here.

74
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,524
Sorry.

75
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:10,443
I tried to get to the hospital alone,
but...

76
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,028
I'll call an ambulance.

77
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,947
Don't. It'll only complicate things.

78
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:18,743
Let's just take that and go.

79
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:36,177
What about that man?

80
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,430
Did he not say anything
when you took the dashcam?

81
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,266
He may tell people what he saw.

82
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,185
That man...

83
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,480
can't say anything anymore.

84
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,608
What did you do to him?

85
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,860
Did you threaten him?

86
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,413
The person you're trying to reach
is not available.

87
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:07,166
So-bong isn't picking up either.

88
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,168
I'm sure they're together.

89
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,880
He even removed the manual control remote.

90
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,882
He's completely out of control.

91
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,635
He can't develop desires. You know that.

92
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,970
It may be for the best...

93
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,431
since we avoided
this wedding tying us to Mr. Suh.

94
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,352
The chairman won't be
able to push it anymore either.

95
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,608
Hey. Shin.

96
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:34,652
Where were you?

97
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,654
Your mom was so worried.

98
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:41,075
Why did you remove that?

99
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,161
Why are you doing this?
You won't listen to me anymore?

100
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:46,622
I couldn't listen to you.

101
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,333
-Sorry.
-Were you with So-bong?

102
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,087
She was attacked because of me.

103
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:55,673
So you did leave
the wedding because of her.

104
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,008
Why are you acting so different?

105
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:01,178
Are you the one I created?
Are you really my son?

106
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,596
Dr. Oh.

107
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,599
Am I not your son if I don't act
like the human Nam Shin?

108
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,645
Can a robot not be your real son?

109
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,565
What? Why you...

110
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,865
The man who attacked So-bong

111
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:23,367
was the man who followed human
Nam Shin in the Czech Republic.

112
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,870
He's definitely Mr. Suh's man,

113
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,496
but he suddenly died in an accident.

114
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,749
I thought I should tell you this.

115
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,084
Suh Jong-gil.

116
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,212
He really tried to kill Shin.

117
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,630
Our instincts were correct.

118
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,176
This can't be the evidence,
so let's monitor Mr. Suh

119
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:41,844
until we have solid proof.

120
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,097
Good job. You've obtained
important information.

121
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,812
I need to tell you something.
Please come in.

122
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,531
So-bong is in the hospital.

123
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:03,991
I'll go now.

124
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:07,119
Okay. Don't wait for Mom, and go.

125
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,128
I thought I should tell you...

126
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,380
before it was too late.

127
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:22,551
I'm sorry,

128
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,930
but I think we should stop
the ultrasound treatment.

129
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:30,184
What do you mean?

130
00:13:33,687 --> 00:13:34,688
Tell us.

131
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,317
It's hopeless.

132
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:44,073
I made the conclusion a while back,
but I thought you'd be too disappointed.

133
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,199
That can't be.

134
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,159
We haven't tried for very long.

135
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,162
We can't give up already.
We need to do more.

136
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,497
If we keep doing it,

137
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:53,874
it'll increase the risk factors.

138
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,503
The stroke he had recently
was probably because of...

139
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,780
He said...

140
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:27,533
that the dashcam had
recorded Nam Shin.

141
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,618
He said he wasn't human.

142
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:31,579
He said he couldn't be human.

143
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,667
And the police didn't find the dashcam?

144
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,460
I think Mr. Nam took it.

145
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,379
Do you think Mr. Nam...

146
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,882
realized he was the man
who tried to kill him...

147
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,967
in the Czech Republic?

148
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:49,430
If he took the dashcam to find
a connection to you...

149
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,433
Watch what you say.

150
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,271
Go shut the door.

151
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:58,772
Yes, sir.

152
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,301
Okay.

153
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:34,892
They caught the hit-and-run driver.

154
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:35,976
Then...

155
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,937
was it really a hit-and-run?

156
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,521
They'll have to investigate further,

157
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,232
but they're more than 90 percent sure.

158
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,528
A hit-and-run.

159
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,700
Why did it have to happen at that time?

160
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:01,627
Just what happened to So-bong?

161
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,087
That's the weird part.

162
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,799
All of the security cameras were dead.

163
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,593
When I spoke to him,

164
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,429
he said a car just came at him.

165
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,598
So I checked it myself,

166
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,433
but it was fine.

167
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,355
He said...

168
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:24,108
the car was smashed in the garage,

169
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:26,402
but there was nothing. It was clean.

170
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,238
It wasn't a hit-and-run.

171
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,408
Someone must be behind it.

172
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,748
The hit-and-run driver of the accident...

173
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,792
on a street in Yeoksam-dong...

174
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:46,880
was arrested for hitting a man
in his 40's and running away.

175
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:49,591
He had fled after the accident,

176
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,802
but he walked into
a police station at 6pm...

177
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,054
and turned himself in.

178
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,224
The victim died at the scene.

179
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,517
Witnesses say...

180
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,277
MATCHING

181
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,951
MATCHING

182
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,728
Did you kill a person this time?

183
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,229
If I hadn't,

184
00:17:45,105 --> 00:17:47,608
all of this would've been found out.

185
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,653
I couldn't let anyone know that
the data center...

186
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,199
of Nam Shin III is located in
my company building.

187
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:58,619
Then even Dr. Oh, whom you
protected, will find out.

188
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,870
She simply created a robot...

189
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,413
because she missed her son.

190
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:04,875
If she finds out that I'm her sponsor,

191
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:06,043
she'll faint from the shock.

192
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,339
How's Shin?

193
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,509
I don't think he'll wake up.

194
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,970
That robot ran out of the wedding

195
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,722
because of So-bong, right?

196
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,308
Keep it in check.

197
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,893
It must be a product.

198
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:26,063
I don't need a defect
that causes problems.

199
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,482
I didn't accept your funding...

200
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,526
to create nothing but a product.

201
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,279
You wanted to create
an excellent AI as a scientist?

202
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,824
He's adjusting to the human world
like a human being.

203
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,910
You'll see. He'll develop
more than imaginable.

204
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,370
That's good for me.

205
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:45,332
This is the inside of his brain, right?

206
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,585
The future of my company...

207
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,673
rests inside that thing's brain.

208
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,468
Why don't you ever believe me?

209
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,638
I'm taking care of my friend
in the hospital for a few days.

210
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:03,058
Who? Like you know all of my friends?

211
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:04,810
I'll call again. Bye.

212
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,438
The results are in.

213
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:10,649
Your muscles are in shock,
so you just need rest.

214
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,319
What did your mom say?

215
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,572
Wasn't she mad that
you blew off the wedding?

216
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,203
Go home, and apologize to Mr. Ji.

217
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:25,330
Tell him that I called you out.

218
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,457
You can't go out of control.

219
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,085
Why can't I?

220
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,589
Just do as you're told. No questions.

221
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,756
Just go now.

222
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,425
Okay.

223
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,304
He's so quick.

224
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,309
At least turn off the lights.

225
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:55,736
Is this a hospital or a hotel?

226
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,696
Money really is nice.

227
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,325
Okay, So-bong. Let's get some sleep.

228
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,929
Let go! Let go of me!

229
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,513
Let me go!

230
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:37,277
Go away.

231
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,526
I knew you'd be like this.

232
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,821
Why did you pretend to be tough?

233
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,032
I didn't pretend.

234
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,492
I am tough.

235
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:32,833
I told you to go.
Why didn't you listen?

236
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,627
Okay.

237
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,921
Hey.

238
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,133
How could you leave
just because I said so?

239
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,692
Something bad happened to you
while helping me.

240
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:03,572
If I were a human,
I would've felt gratitude.

241
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,077
I'm sorry I can only say it
without feeling it.

242
00:22:11,496 --> 00:22:14,416
It's okay. It isn't your fault.

243
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,710
I won't leave tonight.

244
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,712
I'll stay here all night.

245
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:21,923
I'll wake you up every time
you have a bad dream,

246
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,425
so don't worry, and sleep.

247
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,929
I didn't mean
that you should stay all night.

248
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:29,639
I'm a nobody.

249
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,142
You're not a nobody.
You're an incredible person.

250
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,479
I ignored traffic signals
and broke a car...

251
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,938
because of you.

252
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,191
You make me break existing rules

253
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:42,027
and create new rules that didn't exist.

254
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,947
That's oddly persuasive.

255
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:53,538
Again?

256
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,338
-Hey.
-My gosh.

257
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,383
You really are an incredible person.

258
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,009
Hey.

259
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,239
Is this all I get from a corporate heir?

260
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,117
I should ask for the entire store.

261
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:32,119
Do you want this store?

262
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,955
What? You're joking
more and more now.

263
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:40,127
Bring me the dashcam from that dead guy.

264
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,838
Let's see if anyone else saw you.

265
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,381
Okay.

266
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:51,430
It tastes bad to eat alone.
I lost my appetite.

267
00:23:51,513 --> 00:23:52,347
You ate it all.

268
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:54,683
You consumed 1,537 calories--

269
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,269
I ate them because they'd go to
waste if I didn't.

270
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:00,856
What are you waiting for?
I need to digest the food.

271
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:27,507
This is fun!

272
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,821
It's fun, right?

273
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,079
I'm here now.

274
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,707
I'm sorry I'm late.

275
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,380
Fun? What am I, your friend?

276
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,591
Friend?

277
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,219
I've never had a friend.

278
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:16,515
-What?
-I've had Mom and David,

279
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,517
but I've never had a real friend.

280
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,318
Do you want to be friends with me?

281
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,947
What? You don't want to?

282
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,075
Sure, let's be friends, So-bong.

283
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,036
What? Are you speaking informally
just like that already?

284
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,121
Sorry?

285
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,124
I heard friends use informal language
to each other.

286
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,417
Should I not do that?

287
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,463
I'll be nice since we're friends.

288
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:51,633
-You can be casual.
-Hey. So-bong.

289
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,470
That's right, I'm So-bong.

290
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:59,474
We're the first human
and robot to be friends.

291
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:02,227
What do you think?
Totally cool, right?

292
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,062
Totally cool.

293
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,190
My first friend, Kang So-bong.

294
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:08,984
Thanks for being my friend.

295
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,242
Tell your friend.
What will you do now?

296
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,412
Will you keep pretending to be Nam Shin?

297
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,541
What should I do?

298
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:26,084
Why are you asking me that?

299
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,005
I won't tell you what to do anymore.

300
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:34,593
Whatever you choose,
I'll be on your side.

301
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:40,724
Friend, let's return to the room.

302
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,689
Okay. Run.

303
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,901
-Hey.
-What?

304
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:54,195
-Are you having fun?
-Hey.

305
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:25,101
I'm on my way
to answer your question.

306
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,145
I'll be back soon.

307
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,194
Hello, Mr. Suh.

308
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:36,613
Where's Ye-na?

309
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,448
She said she was going on a trip.

310
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:03,473
Why are you here
this early in the morning?

311
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,642
What's with the luggage?

312
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,144
I wanted to stay with Shin,

313
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,854
so I pretended to go a trip.

314
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,694
Do you still think you know your dad?

315
00:28:17,696 --> 00:28:19,239
You said it confidently before.

316
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:21,783
You said that your dad wasn't like that.

317
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,411
When I think about
what that scumbag did...

318
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,329
You're at it again.

319
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:29,749
Why are you blaming Mr. Suh
for Shin's accident?

320
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,714
She's just sensitive. Go inside.

321
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:45,098
I don't want her even looking at Shin.
It makes me sick.

322
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:48,393
Antagonizing her won't do any good.
We still need to hide Shin's state.

323
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:53,273
Don't tell her that
we stopped the ultrasound.

324
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,318
Shin will wake up even without it.

325
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,918
What do I do?

326
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,505
I didn't think my dad would do that.

327
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:22,051
I didn't think he was bad enough
to kill someone.

328
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,889
I'm the daughter of a man like that.

329
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,518
I have no right to be sorry,

330
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,105
but I am sorry.

331
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,816
I'm sorry.

332
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:41,654
I'm so sorry, Shin.

333
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,417
PK GROUP

334
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:17,774
What brings you to my office?

335
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,530
You must feel bad...

336
00:30:24,322 --> 00:30:25,990
about the wedding.

337
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:31,371
Why should I? It wasn't going to
happen anyway.

338
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:34,123
Only one person wanted the wedding.

339
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,167
It's better this way.

340
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,673
I ran into Ms. Suh,

341
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,550
and her eyes were puffy.

342
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,970
As her father, it must break your heart.

343
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:48,805
Your son is the one...

344
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,224
who did that to my daughter.

345
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:56,062
I think I deserve to hear an apology.

346
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,607
Sorry,

347
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,318
but I have no intention of apologizing.

348
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,572
Listen up, Jong-gil.

349
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,533
If you make my child cry,

350
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:11,160
I will make your child cry tears of blood.

351
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,538
If you touch my son again,

352
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,791
I'll do the same to your daughter.

353
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,017
She must know for sure...

354
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,227
about the accident in the Czech Republic.

355
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:49,282
This is the office.
You should've at least changed.

356
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,785
So-bong was badly hurt,
so I was tending to her.

357
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,913
I'll change later.

358
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,083
Why did you come?
You should've stayed at the hospital.

359
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:05,840
So-bong is my friend.

360
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:09,260
I need to make sure
she isn't hurt again because of me.

361
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,470
"Friend"?

362
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,639
Yes.

363
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,850
But you're important to me too.

364
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,228
I promised you,

365
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:22,857
so I'll guard this position.

366
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:25,318
-Go on.
-However,

367
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,821
I'll make the call and do it my way.

368
00:32:29,405 --> 00:32:31,616
I can do it well, so please just watch me.

369
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,952
You made me, after all.

370
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:38,122
And if I do this well,
it'll help the human Nam Shin.

371
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,212
I don't need a Shin who does his job well.

372
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:47,340
I need the real Shin.

373
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,969
Do as you please.
Do whatever you want.

374
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,138
Dr. Oh.

375
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:55,682
Wait here.

376
00:33:04,232 --> 00:33:07,151
SUH JONG-GIL

377
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,116
Dr. Oh.

378
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,076
Dr. Oh.

379
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:19,414
-Where are you going?
-I don't know.

380
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,749
It's too hard to be with him.

381
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,168
My words mean nothing to him now.

382
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,962
I need to change my perspective.

383
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,423
Change your perspective?
What do you...

384
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,608
It's way too early for drinks.

385
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,366
You were too cruel to Ye-na.

386
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,452
You know...

387
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,623
what weddings mean to women.

388
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,000
Why did you hurt her like that?

389
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,711
You're the one who hurt her more.

390
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,552
What... What do you mean?

391
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,515
Think about what you did
to the man your child loves.

392
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:03,893
It was quite memorable.

393
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:07,438
Don't tell me you forgot.

394
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,286
There must be some sort of
a misunderstanding.

395
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:24,831
I wonder...

396
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,001
if the man who tried to kill me for you...

397
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,630
and died while trying to abduct So-bong...

398
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,299
would also think it a misunderstanding.

399
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:41,556
I know that we've had our differences,

400
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,269
but I'm offended to hear you think
I tried to kill you.

401
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:52,191
Would I say that without any proof?

402
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:58,239
I don't plan to use it yet,
so don't worry.

403
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:02,702
However, if you try to harm my people,

404
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,705
I'll do the exact same thing back to you.

405
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,544
Please mark...

406
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,588
my warning.

407
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,762
He said he wasn't human.

408
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,473
He said he couldn't be human.

409
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,560
Who are you?

410
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,825
What are you?

411
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,412
Who do you think I am?

412
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:50,666
Believe as you see and wish.

413
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:52,960
I am...

414
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,922
just me.

415
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,741
Joint, are you on your way?

416
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,494
You packed my clothes and
laptop without telling Dad?

417
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,371
Of course. I'm on my way.

418
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,332
I'll be on my way. Bye.

419
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,462
I'm so bored.

420
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,882
When is he coming?

421
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,349
What's this?

422
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,353
Hello. I'm Maibo.

423
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,119
Were you waiting for me?

424
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,287
You were bored, right?

425
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:10,788
No, not at all.

426
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:15,459
But what's this? Your alter ego?

427
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:17,169
He'll play with you when I'm not around.

428
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:19,714
He has lots of functions.
I'll teach you one by one.

429
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,059
So?

430
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,145
What's the answer to this question?

431
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,772
I told Mom I'll keep acting like
the human Nam Shin.

432
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,569
Good. She must be relieved.

433
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,239
How's the company?

434
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,950
What about the office and the garage?

435
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,243
It must be a total mess.

436
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:51,162
There isn't a single trace.

437
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,914
I checked the security videos,
but they were deleted.

438
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,417
How is that possible?

439
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,046
I just got the chills. I'm scared.

440
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,172
You're scared?

441
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,221
What are you doing?

442
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,681
I'm going to sleep here tonight.

443
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,767
Says who? Forget it.

444
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:13,684
Why not?

445
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:17,813
Shouldn't a friend eat together and
stay with a friend who's scared?

446
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:22,443
You don't eat or sleep anyway.

447
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,112
Joint will be here with my things, so go.

448
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,282
You told me to bring this.
Let's watch it together.

449
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,534
I'll watch it myself. Let's go.

450
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,933
Do you think a guy and
a girl can be friends?

451
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,727
-What?
-According to a survey,

452
00:39:56,811 --> 00:40:00,272
55 percent of women said that people
of the opposite sex can't be friends.

453
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,607
Which side are you with?

454
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,735
Stop being stupid, and go.

455
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,028
The 55 or 45?

456
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,280
Why won't you say?
I want to know more about my friend.

457
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,304
The VIP suite?

458
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:36,892
I knew it.

459
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,229
She's the patient.
She isn't taking care of anyone.

460
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:47,570
I'm sure it has to do with Mr. Nam.

461
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:55,703
This is like a hotel.

462
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,253
What's this?

463
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,465
I spoke with Dr. Oh.

464
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:08,924
She's very upset.

465
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,135
-Sorry?
-That kid...

466
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,511
rebelled hard against her.

467
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:15,222
He said he'll act like
Shin the way he wants.

468
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,224
Naturally, she's upset.

469
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,226
Her son is lying unconscious
before her eyes.

470
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:22,062
So what did she say to him?

471
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,731
It couldn't have been pleasant.

472
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,109
She said something like,
"What I need is the real Shin."

473
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,155
He listens to you,

474
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,574
so make sure he doesn't antagonize her.

475
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,701
What if she takes extreme measures?

476
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:37,786
"Extreme measures"?

477
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,291
Did I say that?

478
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:43,709
I spoke wrong.

479
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:49,298
Anyway, does he really call you a friend?

480
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,427
-Yes.
-Gosh, that kid.

481
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,930
He even made friends on his own.
He's all grown up.

482
00:41:57,264 --> 00:42:00,768
I know I made him,
but I'm still curious about him.

483
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:03,812
If he can get a girlfriend,
he'd be perfect.

484
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,663
Did he come and go already?

485
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,678
Maibo.

486
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:40,057
If his mom may take extreme measures,

487
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,767
it must be that, right?

488
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,853
The kill switch?

489
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,250
What is this? Is he dancing?

490
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,836
He's moving the best he can.

491
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,045
Allow him to be cute.

492
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,923
Do you want to be my bodyguard again?

493
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,759
What if an error occurs
at the office without you?

494
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,679
Forget it.

495
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:21,849
It'll probably cause a fuss
about your wedding.

496
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,852
People might get
the wrong idea if I go now.

497
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,021
Did you...

498
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,648
lie to me today?

499
00:43:30,399 --> 00:43:32,401
I didn't. Why?

500
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:37,031
Forget it. I'm going to sleep.

501
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,158
Is it 45 or 55?

502
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,535
You didn't answer me earlier.

503
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,580
45. Happy?

504
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,416
I'm open-minded enough
to be friends with a robot.

505
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,543
A guy friend is a piece of cake.

506
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:51,587
Bye.

507
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:09,063
He won't tell me about his Mom.

508
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:14,401
When he heard her say that
she needs the real Shin,

509
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,821
he must've been so hurt.

510
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,660
You don't know pain
since you're a robot.

511
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:25,287
You don't know loneliness either.

512
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:32,920
Right now, I'm so glad that he's a robot.

513
00:45:01,573 --> 00:45:02,616
Friend.

514
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,411
Another error occurred.

515
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,279
Mr. Nam...

516
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:44,825
At first, I thought of him as
a machine or object.

517
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,369
But after spending time with him,

518
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,414
I found he speaks and acts like a person.

519
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,542
It's just me, isn't it?

520
00:45:53,876 --> 00:45:55,794
You've never felt that way, right?

521
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:10,184
You said you'd let me talk whenever
I want, right?

522
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:15,022
You said you have no complicated feelings
and don't try to hide your faults.

523
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,693
You can talk all night
since I don't get tired.

524
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:25,032
I may be getting punished...

525
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,161
for sometimes thinking
about something so absurd.

526
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:31,580
Like what?

527
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,336
That you seem like a person.

528
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:44,551
When So-bong said it, I played dumb,

529
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,638
but I thought that way at times too.

530
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,682
Why should that be punished?

531
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:55,479
I often thought of things
that would make the other Shin angry.

532
00:46:57,105 --> 00:47:00,150
That I wish he were more like you.

533
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,446
That I like you because
you weren't emotional,

534
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,365
reckless, or cynical.

535
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:11,370
That I like that you're rational
and get things done.

536
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:12,996
Things like that.

537
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,083
I simply lack emotions and ambition.

538
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,088
I know.

539
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,257
As long as the results are good,

540
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,467
you can make the decisions from now on.

541
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,428
Dr. Oh may disagree,

542
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,139
but I'll support you the best I can.

543
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:32,307
Do you mean it?

544
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:36,311
If it's good for Shin, I don't care.

545
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:37,938
Even if...

546
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:41,608
Shin can never wake up.

547
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:45,779
No. Even if he wakes up...

548
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,240
and can never forgive me,

549
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:52,703
I'll go all the way to the end.

550
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,706
Why do you go so far
for the human Nam Shin?

551
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:59,418
I don't understand which
part of the brain is active.

552
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,587
I don't know.

553
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,506
Why do I go so far?

554
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,260
I can't remember.

555
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:11,805
To me, Shin is like...

556
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,809
a habit that I developed
without knowing...

557
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:18,896
when or why.

558
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,528
Shall we go in?

559
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,031
I need to sleep.

560
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:42,461
Don't touch him.

561
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,881
-Leave him alone.
-I told you.

562
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,591
It may endanger him more.

563
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,968
Whether he dies like this
or dies while trying,

564
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,345
the result is the same.

565
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,389
Even if he dies,
I'll take full responsibility,

566
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:56,475
so don't touch my son.

567
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,559
Understood?

568
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:17,746
Am I not your son if I don't act

569
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,206
like the human Nam Shin?

570
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,668
Can a robot not be your real son?

571
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:23,877
However,

572
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,047
I'll make the call and do it my way.

573
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,425
I can do it well, so please just watch me.

574
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,719
You made me after all.

575
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,941
WARNING

576
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,782
The rule is to hug you if you cry.

577
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,035
I'll do as you say.

578
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,332
So don't be sad.

579
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:10,632
Have you lost your mind?

580
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,343
Why did you take out the kill switch?

581
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,178
What do you plan to do?

582
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:18,223
-Will you kill him now?
-What choice do I have?

583
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:21,143
-He keeps getting weirder.
-He's a robot.

584
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,978
A robot that you made!

585
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,063
He isn't getting weird. He's progressing!

586
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:29,317
Why? Are you afraid he'll
progress even more?

587
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,571
In case he'll progress more
and hurt your son?

588
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,699
How could you even imagine
something so insane?

589
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:37,325
You're being ridiculous!

590
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:42,622
You're no scientist.

591
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:46,793
You're just a bad mom. Do you know that?

592
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,903
I'm leaving for work.

593
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:18,992
BEANSPROUT SOUP
DRIED POLLACK SOUP

594
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,219
Corporate heir reporting for duty.

595
00:51:37,302 --> 00:51:39,179
I'll go to the hospital later, friend.

596
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:42,516
Maibo, relay the message to
my friend, So-bong.

597
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,392
MESSAGE SENT

598
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,687
So-bong's here.

599
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:49,940
So-bong.

600
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:54,402
-What were you doing?
-Why are you here?

601
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:56,738
Let's go back to the hospital.

602
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,034
You asked me to be
your bodyguard again...

603
00:52:01,368 --> 00:52:02,953
in case another error occurs.

604
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,455
You didn't want people getting
the wrong idea.

605
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,126
Mr. Nam must have lost his mind.

606
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:10,836
Did he cancel the wedding for her?

607
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,547
He's shameless.
How could he bring her here?

608
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:17,759
-Gosh, I feel so bad for Ms. Suh.
-I know.

609
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,011
Don't mind them. I'm not leaving.

610
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:23,431
I don't like how
the security videos were deleted.

611
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:27,060
That man was definitely involved
with the accident.

612
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:30,230
You can just admit
you were worried about me.

613
00:52:30,313 --> 00:52:31,314
Let's go.

614
00:52:33,567 --> 00:52:36,319
Let go of my hand.
Where are we going?

615
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,534
You ran off from the wedding.

616
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,202
Why did you come here?

617
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,372
I can't marry Ms. Suh.

618
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,043
Forget Ye-na.

619
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:54,129
What about Jong-gil?

620
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:55,755
I'll make sure...

621
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,425
Mr. Suh can't do anything to me.

622
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,136
Do you have something on him?

623
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:03,847
I'll handle that.

624
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:06,266
Does he not scare you anymore?

625
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,103
I don't have any fear.

626
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:14,399
Learn to do one more thing,
and you're complete.

627
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:18,528
Don't forgive anyone
who gets in the way...

628
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:20,697
of your decisions.

629
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,824
Even if it's your mom.

630
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,952
Your enemy is not always your enemy,

631
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:28,747
and your ally isn't always your ally.

632
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,959
If you can understand that much,

633
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,463
I'll let you take my place.

634
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:40,300
Thank you, Grandpa.

635
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:41,968
Thank you for what?

636
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,012
Come in.

637
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,859
I'll follow my own decisions
just like you said.

638
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,029
Kang So-bong...

639
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,324
will be my personal bodyguard again.

640
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,675
Don't mind them.
Don't look at them either.

641
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:24,678
I envy your lack of emotions right now.

642
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,974
Humans are sensitive
to people's attention.

643
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,601
You must be hungry.
What do you want to eat?

644
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:34,354
You don't even know
what it's like to have cravings.

645
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:36,356
What should we have?

646
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:38,650
Sandwiches.

647
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,902
Let's eat at somewhere cool, like a park.

648
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,835
Go ahead.

649
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:58,712
I'm going to run to the ladies room.

650
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,228
He always calls you "Mom".

651
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,647
He said that his mom was his creator,

652
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:18,982
family, and friend.

653
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,234
So?

654
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:24,404
Why are you saying that?

655
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,781
If you're his mom, treat him that way.

656
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:33,747
You can't kill your own son.

657
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,627
What do you mean?

658
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,004
The kill switch.

659
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:42,881
I overheard.

660
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,300
To him, that's like death.

661
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:49,554
Did you tell him?

662
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,931
Does he know?

663
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,976
If he did,

664
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,437
he couldn't smile at you
like he did earlier.

665
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:00,023
He may lack emotions,

666
00:56:00,106 --> 00:56:02,275
but he knows when to smile.

667
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,361
If you're really his mom,

668
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,863
please get rid of that horrible device.

669
00:56:08,323 --> 00:56:09,991
I'm begging you.

670
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,297
-It's so hard.
-Even I can do better.

671
00:56:24,881 --> 00:56:25,882
Seriously.

672
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:28,259
You're so bad at it.

673
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:30,136
You should get that.

674
00:56:58,331 --> 00:56:59,416
Why did you get two?

675
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,792
You want me to eat two?

676
00:57:02,168 --> 00:57:03,545
We're friends,

677
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:04,921
so I'll eat with you.

678
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,093
Can you really eat?

679
00:57:10,802 --> 00:57:11,886
Once in a while.

680
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,931
When I want to be a proper friend to you.

681
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,740
I don't know whom I should pity.

682
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,286
Is it you or him?

683
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,237
What are you staring at?

684
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,157
People.

685
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:16,659
I'm trying to understand them more.

686
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:19,829
You're surrounded by such terrible people.

687
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,415
Aren't you sick of people?

688
00:58:24,083 --> 00:58:25,460
I want to understand you more.

689
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:27,504
What?

690
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:35,011
I need to know more about you, So-bong.

691
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,266
That very moment,

692
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:42,894
I thought for the first time...

693
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,064
that I wished the one before me...

694
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,400
wasn't a robot.

695
00:58:50,735 --> 00:58:53,112
I wished he was a person just like me.

696
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:01,806
