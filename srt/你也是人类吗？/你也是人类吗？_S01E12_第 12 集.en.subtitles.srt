1
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,267
Hi, Ye-na.

2
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,733
That's how our secret began.

3
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,280
Idiots.

4
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,574
They didn't even know he was listening.

5
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,459
They probably didn't know
he'd wake up so soon.

6
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,847
He trusted nobody,

7
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,933
but he waited for me.

8
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,023
I'll be back soon.

9
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,989
It's time.

10
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,282
Turn on your phone.

11
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:04,415
If I do this,

12
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,793
I can have you, right?

13
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:09,671
Ms. Suh turned on her phone.

14
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,840
We've located her.

15
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,342
I'm not sorry to Dad.

16
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,011
What you want isn't in there.

17
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:18,513
It's at the office.

18
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,018
What do you mean by that?

19
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,436
What is that?

20
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,648
A robot that looks just like Shin.

21
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,155
I'm not sorry at all.

22
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,087
Well,

23
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,047
there's something you need to know.

24
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,674
What is it?

25
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,473
Never mind. I'll see you at home.

26
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,650
Hello?

27
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,902
We've got a problem.

28
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:16,613
My dad found me and he's coming now.

29
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,573
I need to move Shin,

30
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,367
so come right now.
Don't tell anyone.

31
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,577
Okay.

32
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,209
Shin is all I have now.

33
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,250
Blood.

34
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:13,711
Why are you...

35
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,006
Have you never seen
a person bleed before?

36
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,435
You like me?

37
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,521
Who do you think you are?

38
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:38,486
The kill switch.

39
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,155
No.

40
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,831
We'll have to postpone the presentation.

41
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,751
My hand is a mess,
and I don't feel well.

42
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,878
-Shin.
-See you later.

43
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,047
You too, Grandpa.

44
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,467
And you too, Mr. Suh.

45
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:13,771
Shin!

46
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,356
Shin!

47
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,233
Shin.

48
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,205
The person you have reached...

49
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,086
Where are you?
Why won't you pick up?

50
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,506
It's So-bong.

51
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,761
Are you okay? Where are you?

52
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,346
I'm at Mom's house,

53
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:49,640
but Nam Shin isn't here.

54
00:05:49,932 --> 00:05:51,684
Get out of there right now!

55
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,273
Don't contact anyone but me.

56
00:05:58,483 --> 00:06:00,360
Let's meet where we rode the bikes.

57
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:03,321
I want to see you. Come quickly.

58
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,656
Okay. I'll go right now.

59
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:25,426
Dr. Oh just won't give up
on the kill switch.

60
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,888
That isn't the problem right now.

61
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,141
What did you do without telling me?

62
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,643
Where is he,

63
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,062
and why did the one in bed
suddenly show up?

64
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,981
"The one in bed suddenly
showed up"? What...

65
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,567
You didn't even know what was happening?

66
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,403
The real Shin...

67
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,989
showed up in his place!

68
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,497
MY SON

69
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,087
He isn't picking up.

70
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,771
So-bong.

71
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,913
I thought something happened to you.

72
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,666
I thought you disappeared.

73
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:41,377
I waited.

74
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,338
I didn't check your GPS or call.

75
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,301
I waited until you came.

76
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,020
So-bong.

77
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,897
Don't go anywhere.

78
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,775
Don't go anywhere.

79
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,419
Why didn't you tell me?

80
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,505
How could you be the only one

81
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,798
who knew that Shin had woken up?

82
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,592
I'm sorry.

83
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,886
I meant to tell you in time, but...

84
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:33,179
In time?

85
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,931
Do you want to kill him?

86
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,184
How could you bring him out
when he just woke up?

87
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,394
What if something goes wrong again?

88
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:42,563
What if he can never wake up again?

89
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,482
Just because he opened his eyes

90
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,942
doesn't mean he's recovered.

91
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,362
Many regain consciousness
and lose it again.

92
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:52,865
You should've been more
careful like Dr. Oh said.

93
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:57,245
I wanted him to return to work quickly.

94
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,580
I was short-sighted.

95
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,707
I want to kick you out right now,

96
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,044
but I'm holding back
because of your situation.

97
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,546
If this happens again,

98
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:09,048
I'll have to admit him into my hospital.

99
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,466
That's enough.

100
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,805
Regardless,

101
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,473
Shin woke up.

102
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,313
Where are we going?

103
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:27,483
I don't know. Somewhere far.

104
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,613
How's the human Nam Shin?

105
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,323
Is he just as I imitated?

106
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,079
You like me?

107
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,123
Who do you think you are?

108
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,335
He's nothing like you.

109
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,880
Can't we go to my Mom's house?

110
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:52,174
-I'm curious about the human Nam Shin.
-No!

111
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:59,682
Sorry. I got worked up.

112
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,560
Let's not go there.

113
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,022
No good can come of you being with him.

114
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,778
JI YOUNG-HOON

115
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,574
Ye-na feels bad.

116
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,535
She was rash, but it was for
Shin, so please understand.

117
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,496
Please go to the hospital and act hurt.

118
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,789
He can't do that.

119
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:26,751
So-bong? Are you with him?

120
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,420
Who knows what you people will do to him?

121
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,380
I know what you're worried about,

122
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,382
but let's deal with the emergency first

123
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,134
and discuss it with Dr. Oh.

124
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:36,844
What is there to discuss?

125
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,973
So-bong.
Put him on the phone right now.

126
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:42,141
Or...

127
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,979
So-bong. I'll make sure
nothing happens to him,

128
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:48,522
so trust me, and go to the hospital.

129
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,525
I need to discuss something with you,
so I'll stop by.

130
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,195
Okay. Thanks.

131
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,699
They'll go to the hospital.

132
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,285
You'll discuss with So-bong?

133
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,622
I'll discuss with her
and fight with you...

134
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,499
-from now on.
-What?

135
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,964
Where did you hide the kill switch?
Give it to me now.

136
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,594
Do you really think you can activate it?

137
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,514
Please give it to me.
I'll take care of it.

138
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,058
I've already decided to be a bad mom.

139
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,477
I know how special he is to you,

140
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:28,813
but I have no choice.

141
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:31,440
I'm not talking about him.
This is about you!

142
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,570
What? You don't care if he's gone?

143
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,990
With whom did you spend
more time? Your son or him?

144
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,869
Even if he is a robot,
he cared for you all this time.

145
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,038
Getting rid of him doesn't mean
he didn't exist!

146
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,041
You thought of your son
when you looked at him.

147
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,585
Don't you think your son will
make you think of him?

148
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,923
You're too soft to let it go.
Why don't you see that?

149
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,077
Why aren't you moving?

150
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,747
You look like you're watching something.

151
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:37,882
I thought something happened to you.

152
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,259
I thought you disappeared.

153
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,595
What is that?

154
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,680
It's a recording in me of you earlier.

155
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,269
Turn it off.

156
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,276
Why did you cry?

157
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,198
-What?
-Humans cry when they're happy too.

158
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,408
Is that why you cried?

159
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,662
Were you so happy that your friend,
who you thought disappeared, showed up?

160
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,296
You're not my friend anymore.

161
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,465
Why not?

162
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,675
Do you not like me anymore?

163
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,637
No. It's because...

164
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:26,680
I like you more.

165
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,643
I like you.

166
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:36,065
Not as a friend, but like a human man.

167
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:39,151
But I'm not a human man.

168
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:43,072
I like you more than any human man.

169
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,076
If you don't believe me...

170
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,924
When you say you like me,

171
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,510
do you mean the chemical reaction of love?

172
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:09,557
Then which chemicals have been released?

173
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,684
Dopamine, which makes you feel interest?

174
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,061
Phenethylamine,
which paralyzes rational thoughts?

175
00:14:14,144 --> 00:14:16,355
Or oxytocin? Endorphin?

176
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,693
That's something you analyze.

177
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:24,613
I don't know love.

178
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,366
I can only feel it.

179
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,913
I just want to see you and be with you.

180
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,084
You feel it?

181
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,004
Emotions are hard, aren't they?

182
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,507
You can't see or touch them.

183
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,433
What are you doing?

184
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,935
I'm trying to see if I can feel you too.

185
00:14:59,273 --> 00:15:01,567
What do you think?
Can you feel me?

186
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,698
Not yet.

187
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:09,783
Sorry.

188
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:12,036
It's okay.

189
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,788
It's not like I like you
because I expect something.

190
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,311
You said this was from your mom.

191
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,438
My mom said...

192
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,565
that this pendant...

193
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:44,193
was my mom's love for me,

194
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:47,571
so I should give it to
someone whom I want...

195
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:48,989
to give my heart later on.

196
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,743
She said I must learn how to
give all I have without...

197
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,204
thinking about what I received
to become an adult.

198
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:02,378
Isn't it pretty?

199
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:12,930
Hi, my son.

200
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,016
You look good even in a hospital gown.

201
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,563
So-bong, how about a date with me?

202
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,699
She can't activate
the kill switch for a while...

203
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,117
since Shin isn't well.

204
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,369
"For a while"?

205
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:38,247
Dr. Oh must not feel sorry for him at all.

206
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:41,375
She's trying her best
to rid herself of that feeling.

207
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,711
What if he runs far, far away?

208
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,839
It's no use.
It can be activated remotely.

209
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,048
What if we break it?

210
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,759
It's the same.
It'll be activated if it breaks.

211
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,141
Is there really no way?

212
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,643
We can turn him off...

213
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,979
so that the kill switch doesn't work.

214
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:04,857
But if we turn him off,
he's like a walking corpse.

215
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,529
I think I know what to do.

216
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,197
What?

217
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:14,241
If I want to gain a life,

218
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:16,035
I must risk a life.

219
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,214
Shin.

220
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:31,133
You fainted.

221
00:17:31,675 --> 00:17:33,177
You're okay, right?

222
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:44,938
Shin.

223
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,984
Can you see me?

224
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,030
It's Mom.

225
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:58,744
Ye-na.

226
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,414
Let's give them some privacy.

227
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,511
-What are you doing?
-Stop it!

228
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:16,929
-I want my Mommy!
-Let go.

229
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,847
Shin! No!

230
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,641
Let go! Shin!

231
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,486
I'm tired.

232
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,287
Do I make you uncomfortable?

233
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,497
That's a given.

234
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,209
You've been watching me, but I haven't.

235
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,963
I'm asking out of curiosity.

236
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,843
Did you really consider
that thing as your son?

237
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,391
I made it while thinking of you,

238
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,520
and I brought it here to help you.

239
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,105
Forget it.

240
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,649
Just bring Young-hoon.

241
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,237
Let's...

242
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,574
get closer...

243
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,659
over time.

244
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:48,645
It's my bro.

245
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,357
Seriously, you punk.

246
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,027
Are you okay?

247
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,530
Why didn't you say you woke up?

248
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,241
I don't know.

249
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,162
-Why didn't I?
-What kind of an answer is that?

250
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,748
Do you know what
we've been doing for you?

251
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,709
I'll have to find out...

252
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,630
what fun things happened while I was out.

253
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,592
Bring me that tomorrow.

254
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,637
I need to see what my clone looks like.

255
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,392
We'll send him away
once you're all better.

256
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,727
There's no need to see him.

257
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,062
Why can't I see it?

258
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,816
You may feel weird.

259
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,402
It's not me, but you...

260
00:20:37,486 --> 00:20:39,571
who felt weird, wasn't it?

261
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,676
I'm asking out of curiosity.

262
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,807
Did you really consider
that thing as your son?

263
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:08,684
You don't care if he's gone?

264
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,186
You thought of your son
whenever you looked at him.

265
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,689
Don't you think your son will make
you think of him?

266
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,491
PK MEDICAL CENTER

267
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,004
It's empty?

268
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,464
Where did they go?

269
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,718
You don't think...

270
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:45,554
they went to a TV statio
 or anything, do you?

271
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,681
No.

272
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:50,434
So-bong isn't reckless enough to do that.

273
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:01,361
So-bong.

274
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,115
Where's Shin?

275
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,953
You trust me, right?

276
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,548
Then...

277
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,176
don't ask anything,

278
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,761
and do as I say.

279
00:22:34,811 --> 00:22:35,896
I'm sorry...

280
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:39,691
for doing this to you.

281
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,706
It's his watch.

282
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,708
I brought all the ones from home too.

283
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,753
You didn't...

284
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,548
remove the one from
his wrist too, did you?

285
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,757
I did. Why?

286
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,300
I deactivated him...

287
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,302
and hid him where no one can find him.

288
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:53,348
Look. Do you know how
insulting this is to him?

289
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,435
It isn't insulting to activate the
kill switch and completely destroy him?

290
00:23:57,644 --> 00:24:00,230
-What?
-I made it easier for you.

291
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,857
Why are you so worked up?

292
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,025
You were going to activate
the kill switch anyway.

293
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:08,280
I heard that if I remove the watch,
the kill switch is ineffective.

294
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,449
Are you threatening me?

295
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:11,533
No.

296
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,160
I'm negotiating.

297
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:17,497
Give me the kill switch.

298
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,332
Right now.

299
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:26,840
It's Kang So-bong.

300
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,801
They're having a heated discussion
about something.

301
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:31,470
It's obvious.

302
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,680
They're talking about that robot.

303
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:36,725
Because I like you.

304
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,935
I like you.

305
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,605
I just like you.
I like you unconditionally.

306
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,652
Then keep him powered down...

307
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,947
I'll never give you the kill switch.

308
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,949
How could you say that?

309
00:24:53,033 --> 00:24:55,285
You said it's insulting
to leave him like that.

310
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,621
Because I know you can't do that.

311
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,374
You're going this far
because you care about him.

312
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,210
You would never...

313
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:06,046
keep him in that dead state.

314
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:10,800
This is a fight you cannot win.

315
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,553
Put the watch...

316
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,889
back on him.

317
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,682
Then just activate it.

318
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,519
But you'll become a murderer.

319
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,896
Because you'll kill me too.

320
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,482
-So-bong.
-As soon as he's turned back on,

321
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:27,150
I'll stick right by his side.

322
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,652
I'll be with him night and day.

323
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:30,529
I won't take a step away from him.

324
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,990
Then one day, he'll explode,

325
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,576
and I'll die with him.

326
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:39,246
So activate it whenever you want.

327
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,748
I'm prepared for it.

328
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,751
Do you know how reckless you are?

329
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,587
He's the one who's reckless.

330
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,048
He saved me from dying.

331
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,217
He scolded anyone who disrespected me.

332
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:54,636
He stayed all night with me
when I was injured.

333
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,807
He promised to protect me
anytime, anywhere.

334
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,437
I promised him too.

335
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,066
That although I'm not
as strong or smart as he is,

336
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,860
I'll do whatever it takes to protect him.

337
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:15,407
He kept all of his promises,
so I need to keep mine.

338
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,077
That's courtesy and respect...

339
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,079
regardless of being a human or a robot.

340
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,966
That was my last resort,

341
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:35,135
but it didn't work.

342
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:41,766
Can you promise me as well?

343
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,315
That you'll take responsibility for him.

344
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,196
-Yes.
-It won't be easy.

345
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,365
I know.

346
00:26:58,533 --> 00:26:59,909
I'm afraid as well.

347
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:11,463
WARNING

348
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,929
Shin wants to see So-bong.

349
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,314
Let's go in.

350
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,108
Don't tell him about our conversation.

351
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,444
Okay.

352
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,831
You're the guard that
I hit in the airport, right?

353
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:49,125
Yes.

354
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:52,045
Bring me that robot that looks like me.

355
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,217
I asked Young-hoon,
but I haven't heard anything yet.

356
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,345
From the looks of it,
it would be quicker to ask her.

357
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,222
Why do you want to see him?

358
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,100
Why did you come alone without it?

359
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:07,852
Did you two discuss a secret or something?

360
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,855
We have no secrets.

361
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:17,612
I think you should bring him for a bit.

362
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,586
Okay. I'll bring him right over.

363
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:44,973
I'll let you move soon.

364
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:51,498
Turn around.

365
00:30:00,757 --> 00:30:01,841
Smile.

366
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:06,554
Imitate me.

367
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,900
I don't like looking up to you.

368
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,360
Sit down.

369
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,453
Speak.

370
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:31,996
Can't you talk?

371
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,374
It's nice to meet you.

372
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,751
I'm the AI robot, Nam Shin III.

373
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,755
A lot of data about you is
stored in my memory.

374
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,216
So I know you very well.

375
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,093
This is unfair.

376
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:47,220
I know nothing about you.

377
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,556
Ask me anything.

378
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,100
First,

379
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:54,894
prove that you're a robot.

380
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,607
You seem so human.

381
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:02,902
Your appearance, skin, and everything.

382
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,573
It feels slightly different.

383
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,491
Want to touch?

384
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,202
Move it.

385
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:19,252
Then I'll prove it another way.

386
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,971
That's me.

387
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,599
They're Nam Shin I and II.

388
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,102
I have both of their memories.

389
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:40,148
You're displaying what's in your head?

390
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:47,572
It's the sides of Mom
that you haven't seen.

391
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,830
She's smiling at you.

392
00:31:57,707 --> 00:32:00,126
There are scenes of her being
sad looking at you too.

393
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:01,586
That's enough.

394
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,213
Turn it off.

395
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:09,260
I'm a robot, so there's
no need to feel threatened.

396
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,221
I came here to help you.

397
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,729
Does that mean you'll continue to help me?

398
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,398
How can I help?

399
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,193
I'll think about it.

400
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,195
Will you help me or not?

401
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,446
I'll help you...

402
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:30,031
in any way I can.

403
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,380
-I'm fine.
-What did Mr. Nam say?

404
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:47,924
He asked me to keep helping him.

405
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,635
With what? You've helped
him so much already.

406
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,220
What about Dr. Oh?

407
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,055
I didn't see Mom.

408
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,058
I don't think she wants to see me.

409
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,645
I'm sure that's not it.

410
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,939
You can see her next time.

411
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,067
Anyway, thanks...

412
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:07,652
for doing as I said

413
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:09,320
without asking any questions.

414
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,865
Then take me to your house
instead of the hospital.

415
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:13,908
My house?

416
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,411
-Why?
-I'll see where you live...

417
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:18,579
Since I need to know more about you.

418
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,666
Ms. Jo knows about you.

419
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:22,792
It's okay.

420
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,962
Since she knows, I can be myself.

421
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,215
Sure. Let's go.

422
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,473
Is that the heinous device?

423
00:33:38,391 --> 00:33:39,934
Please let me stay here.

424
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,103
I need to find a way to destroy this,

425
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:43,438
so I'll need resources as well.

426
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,981
What if you can't find a way?

427
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,028
I'll leave it with you...

428
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:53,614
since you don't want him
to be hurt more than anyone.

429
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,491
That...

430
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,703
goes the same for you too.

431
00:33:58,786 --> 00:33:59,996
For me, it's love.

432
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:01,581
For you, it's greed.

433
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:02,707
It doesn't matter.

434
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,793
The more your greed grows,
the safer he'll be.

435
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:09,881
CHAMPION GYM

436
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,799
What? Here?

437
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,927
He'll only be here for a few days, okay?

438
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,554
You crazy little...

439
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:20,183
What's this?

440
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,643
Why is he wearing that necklace?

441
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:26,272
Shin. Are you staying here
because of So-bong?

442
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,733
Yes. I must know everything about her.

443
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,819
My goodness.
Talk about being aggressive.

444
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,656
It's finally no longer an unrequited love.

445
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,284
It's not like that. Stay out of it.

446
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,913
Anyway, Mr. Nam?

447
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,373
May we speak for a moment?

448
00:34:45,708 --> 00:34:47,794
Send him in while I'm being nice.

449
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,816
I know you know about me.

450
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:11,859
It's okay. Look all you want.

451
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,741
I have many questions,

452
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,828
but let's quench my curiosity first.

453
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,123
Take it off.

454
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,751
-Pardon?
-I mean,

455
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:33,131
I heard you were a robot,
but I just can't believe it.

456
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:35,591
If you have no emotions,
you shouldn't have...

457
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:38,136
any sense of embarrassment or humiliation.

458
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:40,555
So... Strip.

459
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,390
Let me see.

460
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,600
Okay.

461
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,811
Stop!

462
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,774
Zip up!

463
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,152
Okay.

464
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,531
Why are you opening there first?

465
00:35:58,948 --> 00:35:59,949
My gosh.

466
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,870
Do you really have no emotions?

467
00:36:04,704 --> 00:36:08,249
No. I comprehend emotions,
but I can't feel them.

468
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:12,879
What is wrong with So-bong...

469
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:19,594
But...

470
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:22,597
Your skin looks so real.

471
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,016
Is this synthetic skin?

472
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,768
That's the second time
I was asked that today.

473
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:29,061
Want to touch?

474
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:31,314
You don't have to if it grosses you out.

475
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:35,484
Gross me out?
How could this gross me out?

476
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,071
I'm so curious.

477
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,366
Then...

478
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,203
Excuse me.

479
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,611
Now that I'm touching it,
I think it is kind of hard.

480
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,532
What do you think you're doing?

481
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:28,871
It's not like that.

482
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:29,872
Are you a pervert?

483
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,375
I housed you and fed you,

484
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:34,961
but you grope my daughter's man?

485
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:37,546
-No. That's not it.
-Shut it!

486
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:40,841
And you.

487
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,636
Is that what rich people do?

488
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,847
You give your body and heart to all women?

489
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,392
You can't even take care of your own body.

490
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,061
How can you handle a corporation?

491
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:58,150
Wait outside. I need to clear the air.

492
00:37:58,734 --> 00:37:59,777
Okay.

493
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:08,327
Clear what air? You get out too.

494
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,038
Don't you ever step foot
in this house again.

495
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:19,630
I wanted to keep my mouth shut
for So-bong's sake,

496
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:21,882
but I'll tell you the truth.

497
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:27,179
Mr. Nam Shin is not human.

498
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,683
That's why I did that. I had to check.

499
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:32,935
You're the one who isn't human!

500
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:34,895
How dare you...

501
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,523
That's not it. He really isn't human!

502
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,151
Exactly! You're not human!

503
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,819
You're an animal!

504
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,948
I'm not an animal. He is...

505
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,159
a robot.

506
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,619
A robot that looks just like a person.

507
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,580
What?

508
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,917
Say that again. What was that?

509
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,253
He's a robot.

510
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,257
Like the ones that
shoot missiles from their fists.

511
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:15,102
Run, run, robot

512
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,399
You call that an excuse?

513
00:39:20,608 --> 00:39:23,527
I see why you're a third-rate journalist.

514
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:26,030
Move out first thing
in the morning tomorrow.

515
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:30,284
It's okay.

516
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:33,371
I'll clear up
the misunderstanding for Ms. Jo.

517
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,998
Should we just go to the hospital?

518
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:39,085
-How can you sleep here?
-I don't sleep anyway.

519
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,628
I don't get cold either.

520
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,673
No matter what anyone does,
pretend to sleep.

521
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,385
-Okay?
-Got it.

522
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:51,639
Sit down.

523
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,151
Are you sleepy?

524
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:08,280
Your eyes lost focus,
and your eyelids drooped down.

525
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,950
A little.

526
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:14,286
It was a stressful day today.

527
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:24,630
The human Nam Shin doesn't
seem happy to be awake.

528
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,133
Why?

529
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,593
His lips go up,
but his eyes didn't smile.

530
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,721
He spoke coldly about Mom too.

531
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,058
Lucky you. You have nothing better to do.

532
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,352
I'll just worry about myself.

533
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:40,187
About what?

534
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,023
It's none of your concern.

535
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:45,693
I'm not reliable enough...

536
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,195
to be responsible for someone.

537
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:52,741
I'm someone who runs away
if things get tough.

538
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:55,953
Whom do you have to be responsible for?

539
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,810
Kang So-bong's eyes.

540
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,105
Kang So-bong's nose.

541
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,107
Kang So-bong's mouth.

542
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,403
I should look closely.

543
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:32,823
I should look for a long time.

544
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,595
Your blood pressure and pulse spiked.

545
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,472
You're blushing.

546
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,058
Is it because of me?

547
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,104
I was just surprised.

548
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,151
I'm going in. Pretend to sleep.

549
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,940
I'll go get some water.

550
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:55,698
Did I wake you?

551
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,284
I want to stay awake,
but I keep sleeping.

552
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,370
I can't tell whether I'm asleep or dead.

553
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,538
Dead?

554
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,665
Don't say that. You just woke up.

555
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,756
I saw that thing earlier today.

556
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,800
Kang So-bong was here, so I asked her.

557
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:17,720
Dr. Oh told me.

558
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:20,848
I only saw briefly before the accident,
so I didn't know the extent,

559
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,767
but he looked identical to me.

560
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:28,272
-Everyone must've been fooled.
-She built it with you as the model.

561
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,608
Weren't you ever confused?

562
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,193
You know me the best.

563
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,031
Of course not.

564
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,034
Rest up. I'll be back.

565
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,619
Okay.

566
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,836
You and he are both pestered by humans.

567
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,048
That must be why I pitied him.

568
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,383
Even if he's just a robot.

569
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:20,866
Gosh. This kid...

570
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:24,244
He was raised in a palace,
but he's sleeping...

571
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:26,372
in a place like this.

572
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,499
He must really like So-bong a lot.

573
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,795
My gosh. It's cold.

574
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,677
There.

575
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:44,306
My gosh. It's cold.

576
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,407
Mr. Kang! We're in trouble!

577
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,952
Shin's not breathing!
I think he's dead!

578
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,454
He was fine last night.

579
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:15,838
He isn't breathing, and he has no pulse.

580
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:17,631
What do we do?

581
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,466
He must really be dead.

582
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,010
A corporate heir died in our gym?

583
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:23,721
What do we do?

584
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:27,057
What if they frame us for murder?

585
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,520
So-bong! Hurry!

586
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,320
Is it because he slept in the cold?

587
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:42,322
I didn't know.

588
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,615
Who took his watch?

589
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:46,452
Who cares about a stupid watch right now?

590
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,828
Who took it?

591
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,580
I did!

592
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:52,458
It looked uncomfortable,
so I took it off for him.

593
00:45:53,709 --> 00:45:55,794
-Bring it right now.
-He's dying here.

594
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,380
Why do you keep complaining
about a watch?

595
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:01,091
-Call an ambulance. Hurry.
-Okay.

596
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,760
Don't you dare! I'll kill you.

597
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:03,886
Call now!

598
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,596
Just go get the watch!

599
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:15,439
Dad and you guys get out.

600
00:46:15,731 --> 00:46:16,815
He'll wake up soon.

601
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:17,983
That's ridiculous.

602
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:20,027
How can we leave when he's dying?

603
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,695
Trust her, and wait outside.

604
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,867
-Dad, stay.
-Ms. Jo.

605
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,869
Dad needs to stay here.

606
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,384
-Dad.
-Yes?

607
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:46,303
Hold on...

608
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,013
tight.

609
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,599
Don't be too shocked.

610
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,184
Hey. Why...

611
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,977
So-bong, what's wrong with her?

612
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,270
Let go.

613
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:14,873
Hello.

614
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,417
I'm the AI robot, Nam Shin III.

615
00:47:21,505 --> 00:47:23,048
You're all here.

616
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:27,803
Ro... Robot.

617
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,639
What is he?

618
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,852
-Dad!
-Dad!

619
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,396
Dad.

620
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,954
Dad.

621
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,669
Dad.

622
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:06,925
Oh, okay.

623
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:10,846
Are you okay?

624
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,475
Why you...

625
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:17,769
-Why you...
-Dad! Dad!

626
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:19,521
-Why you...
-Stop!

627
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:22,441
-Stop it!
-What are you doing?

628
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,527
It's hard for her too.

629
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,237
Sweetie. Go out.

630
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:29,740
Go buy him some sedatives.

631
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,325
Sorry, Dad.

632
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:32,618
I'll be back later.

633
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,579
-You're not going anywhere!
-Come on.

634
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:36,663
Why...

635
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:41,710
See?

636
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,421
I told you last night.

637
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:49,468
I'm sorry
that I can't tell you everything.

638
00:48:49,718 --> 00:48:52,387
A guy-girl relationship is
only possible among two humans.

639
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,222
No way.

640
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,854
Your dad must've been shocked.

641
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:02,397
Sorry.

642
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,192
Don't say you're sorry anymore.

643
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:08,528
It's not your fault
that you're not human...

644
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:09,988
and that I like you.

645
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,616
Even if worse things happen,

646
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:13,825
let's not be sorry.

647
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:16,912
Every time that happens,

648
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,080
grant me a wish.

649
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,123
What do you want now?

650
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,249
Me?

651
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:25,796
I want to hold hands.

652
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:29,299
I want to hold hands and walk around.

653
00:49:38,558 --> 00:49:40,852
Let's go buy a sedative for Dad.

654
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:45,190
Hello. Please come take a look.

655
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,359
-Food. Food.
-That's right.

656
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:50,737
Face massager. Step inside.

657
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:51,822
Hello.

658
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:55,117
Please step up. Spin the wheel.

659
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:56,952
What a great prize.

660
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,286
Congratulations.

661
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,163
Everyone's winning.

662
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:02,416
Please spin the wheel.

663
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:07,004
Congratulations.
You won sparkling water.

664
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,964
Please spin the wheel.

665
00:50:09,089 --> 00:50:10,465
Did you get the sedative?

666
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,427
Were you looking at other girls
while I went to buy sedatives?

667
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:16,763
Your eyes were about to pop out.

668
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:18,306
I was just doing what you said.

669
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:21,184
-What?
-You said before...

670
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:24,396
not to walk past girls
who are pretty and hot.

671
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:25,939
Then shouldn't I watch them?

672
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,358
That was back then!

673
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:30,360
How are you so clueless?

674
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,656
Your face has gone red like you're angry.

675
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,450
-What's wrong?
-What?

676
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:40,620
It's nothing. I'm just hot.

677
00:50:42,122 --> 00:50:43,206
That's not true.

678
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,377
Is that how you express jealousy?

679
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,963
No. Not at all.

680
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,633
It is jealousy.

681
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:57,012
What do you want right now?

682
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,556
I'll do it instead of saying I'm sorry.

683
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:02,642
This?

684
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,145
Forget it.

685
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:08,815
This?

686
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,026
People will see.

687
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:13,653
Then this?

688
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,745
You're insane.

689
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:32,672
Hello?

690
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:33,924
It's me. Your original.

691
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:36,593
You didn't forget your promise
to help me, did you?

692
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,846
CHAMPION GYM

693
00:51:47,479 --> 00:51:48,772
Why isn't he coming?

694
00:51:54,027 --> 00:51:55,362
NAM SHIN

695
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,531
I agreed to help the human Nam Shin.

696
00:51:58,281 --> 00:51:59,533
I'll be back soon.

697
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,240
I didn't see you before I left yesterday.

698
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,493
I was busy.

699
00:52:44,119 --> 00:52:46,538
Why did you want to meet here?

700
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:49,124
I need to rush back in because of Shin.

701
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:51,626
Mom.

702
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:55,672
Can't I stay here even
if the human Nam Shin recovers?

703
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:57,257
We finished that discussion.

704
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:58,800
No.

705
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,844
I want to stay with you.

706
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,182
If that's what it is, let's stop.

707
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,605
Ask if I'm the only thing
that matters to her.

708
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:13,899
Ask if you're really nothing.

709
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,279
Is the human Nam Shin
all that matters to you?

710
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,324
Do I really mean nothing to you?

711
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,412
I'm sure she'll hesitate.

712
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:32,459
Who's that?

713
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,924
Someone whose honesty I wonder about.

714
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:47,307
Stop being so annoying.

715
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:49,059
This is why...

716
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,311
I regret making you.

717
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,730
You want to hear how I truly feel?

718
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,315
Every time...

719
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:56,983
I looked at you,

720
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,194
I thought of my son, Shin.

721
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:03,615
I won't go with you, so leave,
and never come back.

722
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:06,159
If you do, I'll just die.

723
00:54:07,953 --> 00:54:09,955
I won't go with you, so don't come back.

724
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,457
If you do, I will just die.

725
00:54:13,375 --> 00:54:15,627
I did as I promised.

726
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:19,464
You won't do anything to my mommy, right?

727
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,015
She really does care...

728
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,394
about the stupid robot.

729
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:40,568
Do you get it now?

730
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:43,822
If you're going to
keep whining, go to So-bong.

731
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:49,202
I get it. You're lying.

732
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:50,245
Why you...

733
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:53,498
I've read your expressions
and listened to your voice for 20 years.

734
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,710
But that wasn't the real you just now.

735
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:59,629
Your voice and emotions were all fake.

736
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,464
Why you...

737
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,551
I understand that bloodlines are
important to humans.

738
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,846
I'm sure the human Nam Shin is
more important to you.

739
00:55:09,306 --> 00:55:12,058
So don't feel guilty toward me.

740
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:19,107
Thank you for everything, Mom.

741
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,111
For creating me and watching over me.

742
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,613
I'll remember that.

743
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:37,542
Shin.

744
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,632
You...

745
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,470
are much wiser...

746
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,681
and greater than I, who created you.

747
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:55,393
Now, protect So-bong...

748
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,147
instead of me.

749
00:56:04,986 --> 00:56:06,279
Thank you...

750
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:09,199
for everything too.

751
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:51,199
KANG SO-BONG
CALL

752
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:21,438
Sit or kneel.
I don't like looking up to you.

753
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:23,273
Where is he?

754
00:57:24,232 --> 00:57:25,942
What did you have him do?

755
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,570
Ye-na, go inside.

756
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:30,530
-Shin.
-Now.

757
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,708
Don't you two communicate?

758
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:46,379
You said you liked him.
You said it to me, remember?

759
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:47,672
I do.

760
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:51,217
But what does my liking him
have to do with you?

761
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:52,385
What?

762
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,013
I didn't hit you hard enough
at the airport.

763
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:57,307
You started to like him
while guarding him.

764
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,100
You should've protected me too.

765
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:04,022
Why? Do you hate me because I'm human?

766
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:05,440
No.

767
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,109
I hate you
because you're not like a human.

768
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,237
What?

769
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,109
What's your problem?

770
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,238
I must...

771
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,782
take you away from him.

772
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,244
Is this jealousy?

773
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:26,604
What's it to you whom I see and what I do?

774
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:29,941
So-bong is different.
She is mine alone.

775
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:31,192
You're out of your mind.

776
00:59:31,276 --> 00:59:33,695
Who are you to decide whether
or not I take my place?

777
00:59:33,778 --> 00:59:34,946
Do you want it?

778
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:38,908
Objectively speaking,
who is better suited?

779
00:59:39,242 --> 00:59:41,494
-Isn't it you?
-Yes, it's me.

780
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,663
I don't understand what you mean.

781
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,039
Why did you try to kill me?

782
00:59:46,749 --> 00:59:48,751
