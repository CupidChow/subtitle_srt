1
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,407
For a moment,

2
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,493
I wished you weren't a robot.

3
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,246
How would it have been...

4
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,081
if I weren't a robot?

5
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,002
I'll return to being a slave robot again.

6
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,796
Goodbye,

7
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,465
So-bong.

8
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,092
If I could be sad if we broke up...

9
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,927
-It's fun.
-Me too. Me too.

10
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,387
To the right.

11
00:00:56,306 --> 00:00:58,141
If I could be happy when I'm with you...

12
00:00:58,224 --> 00:00:59,392
Here we go.

13
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:01,853
You're a robot.

14
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,690
But why does my heart hurt so much?

15
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,610
If my heart would break because of you...

16
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,992
Don't go anywhere.

17
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:18,286
Don't go anywhere.

18
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:22,457
If I could cry for you...

19
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,420
I like you.

20
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,507
I like you, too,

21
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,133
So-bong.

22
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:36,346
However,

23
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,306
I'm a robot...

24
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,226
that can't feel love.

25
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,318
Then why am I doing this?

26
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,958
Why are you looking at So-bong like that?

27
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,229
What's your problem?

28
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,190
I must...

29
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:32,026
take you away from him.

30
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,446
Is this jealousy?

31
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,829
Why am I saying this?

32
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,389
I was just fooling around.

33
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,016
Why are you so serious?

34
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,476
Don't fool around with So-bong
like that again.

35
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:10,106
Fine.

36
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,734
But you really seem jealous.

37
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,903
People would think you're in love.

38
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:17,780
I'm leaving.

39
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,991
Thanks for doing what I asked.

40
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:24,829
I won't ask Mom difficult questions again.

41
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:26,831
I have nothing to ask anymore anyway.

42
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,459
I'm leaving.

43
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,843
What? He wants your help again?

44
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,887
Why do you keep doing things for him?

45
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,973
And why did he want to ask Dr. Oh...

46
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,808
which of you is more important?

47
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,811
He did it to hurt you...

48
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:50,688
and make Dr. Oh uncomfortable.

49
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,899
Thanks to that, I told Mom
everything I wanted to say.

50
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,027
I said she doesn't need to worry
about me anymore.

51
00:03:57,904 --> 00:03:58,821
Are you okay?

52
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,242
I have you now.

53
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,454
What's this? I like hearing that,

54
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,455
so say it often.

55
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:10,875
Still, don't meet with that jerk again.

56
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,503
Once you're done playing as him,

57
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,004
you'll never have to see him again.

58
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:26,975
Why did you do that to So-bong?

59
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:30,061
Asking her to protect you...
and if she hates you because you're human.

60
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,688
Why would you say that?

61
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,273
I was messing with her.

62
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,192
I found it funny
to see her liking a robot.

63
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,073
Shin. I'm here.

64
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:44,867
Is everything okay?

65
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,623
Yes. Everything's fine.

66
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,168
Did you go somewhere?

67
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,629
Did you meet someone?

68
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,841
No.

69
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,468
I just went out for a walk.

70
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,639
Get better soon, and take walks with me.

71
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:09,392
I'll go get some rest.

72
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:32,123
Thank you for everything, Mom.

73
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,044
For creating me and watching over me.

74
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,671
I'll remember that.

75
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,220
Please eat, will you?

76
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,223
Starving yourself won't change anything.

77
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,226
You'll just get sick and die sooner.

78
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,230
I'm trying to just die, okay?

79
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,732
Dad.

80
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,653
Even when So-bong...

81
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,865
quit fighting and struggled...

82
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:09,369
or upset me with the hidden camera thing,

83
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:13,122
I called her garbage
and acted harsh on her,

84
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:15,291
but...

85
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,212
I was hurt inside my heart.

86
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:24,217
Because I knew the world had hurt her.

87
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,803
Because that happened to my baby...

88
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,472
because I had no power or money.

89
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,602
But what? A robot?

90
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:37,605
What? She likes a robot?

91
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,148
I mean...

92
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,693
How is that different
from liking this wall?

93
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:45,196
The world has already hurt her enough.

94
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,949
Why must her love be like that too? Why?

95
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:51,077
If you die,
there will be no one to stop her.

96
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,997
So don't be stubborn, and eat just a bit.

97
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,000
I can't bear to see her be in pain again.

98
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,464
I'll just stop eating and die peacefully.

99
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,676
Seriously.

100
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:11,556
Mr. Kang. Shin and So-bong are here.

101
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:14,559
What?

102
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,620
I don't need it. Get out.

103
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,416
Get out of my house. Get out of my gym.

104
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:41,127
Get out of my daughter's heart!

105
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,463
-What's wrong with you?
-What's wrong with me?

106
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,715
What's wrong with you?

107
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,010
How could you love something
that isn't even human?

108
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:52,930
Acting like a human doesn't make it one!

109
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,223
"It"?

110
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:02,273
Who are you?

111
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,108
I'm his dad.

112
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,277
-David.
-Quiet, my son.

113
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:07,987
"My son"?

114
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,492
You're its dad?

115
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,786
A robot has a dad, too?

116
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,457
The jerk who made this thing?

117
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,418
That mad scientist like in the comics?

118
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,128
Stop calling him like that.

119
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,048
I gave birth to him with my heart.

120
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,675
Just as you are So-bong's dad,

121
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,385
I am his dad.

122
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,350
So? What will you do about it?

123
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,519
Then what will you do about it?

124
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:41,479
What? Fine. Hit me. Hit me.

125
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,397
-What do you think you're doing?
-Seriously.

126
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,275
Stop it already.

127
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:51,656
Let's not get physical.
Let's talk it out. Okay?

128
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,926
Do you know what So-bong is like?

129
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,808
When she was five,
she put on a glove herself,

130
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,103
and fractured my nose with her left hook.

131
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,981
You call that strength?

132
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,526
Six months after I made Shin,
he almost pulled out a street lamp

133
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,152
with his two little fingers.

134
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,821
Good for you.

135
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,032
So keep that great son of yours
under control.

136
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,660
I'll control my daughter.

137
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,579
Sure. Fine. Let's do that.

138
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,163
Let's split them up.

139
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,209
Do you really think they'd split up?

140
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,295
-What?
-What?

141
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:50,047
If your human daughter
and your robot son...

142
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:53,009
listened to you,
why would you be like this here?

143
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:57,138
A human and a robot's love story.

144
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,931
What if the world finds out?

145
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,521
They'd be treated like monkeys in a zoo.

146
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,231
You two should be working together.

147
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,233
But instead, the dads are being like this.

148
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,954
Let me ask you something.

149
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:27,418
Does he have any weaknesses?

150
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,630
Like in the movies, will he stop moving...

151
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,840
if you touch something by mistake?

152
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:35,134
Sorry?

153
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,139
If a robot stops moving,
that means it's dead.

154
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,143
No parent would put
in something to kill their child.

155
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,979
-Isn't that right?
-Yes.

156
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:49,065
Of course. Yes.

157
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,401
I suddenly miss him.

158
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:54,654
I'm going to make a call.

159
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:02,161
A man who uses his brain is so sexy.

160
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,954
That guy is so sexy.

161
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,164
What? Sexy?

162
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:08,542
But why am I "Dad" when he's "a guy"?

163
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,840
You can't get rid of the kill switch?

164
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,094
I was upset, which was why
I wanted to see him.

165
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,429
But I feel too bad to even face him.

166
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,765
This is because I'm not skilled enough.

167
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:28,145
It's fine as long as we have it,
so don't worry.

168
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,899
I'll have to pick Dr. Oh's brain
when I can.

169
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:35,236
I'll go to her, so tell him bye for me.

170
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:54,880
Okay. I'll return to the company
with So-bong tomorrow.

171
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:00,511
It was Young-hoon.

172
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,680
He told us to return to the office
and to the house.

173
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,890
I don't like you being in that house.

174
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,393
It won't be for long.

175
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,772
That's right. Your hand.

176
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,983
You need to bandage it like
the human Nam Shin.

177
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,369
You asked if that was jealousy, right?

178
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:32,084
When you said you had to take me
away from him.

179
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,463
Did you really feel jealousy?

180
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,424
You didn't even want to see his face
and got so angry?

181
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,343
I did act before making my judgment,

182
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,637
but I don't know what jealousy is.

183
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:47,057
Many humans don't know
their feelings either.

184
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,519
Your emotions are embedded
within your actions.

185
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,063
Other people may not know, but I do.

186
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,317
Emotions are embedded within actions.

187
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,906
We're going to sleep here with you today.

188
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,033
We'll watch you and guard you...

189
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,993
so you don't stop breathing.

190
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,704
Really? Then I'll...

191
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,956
entrust you guys with him.

192
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,750
Okay, so let go. It hurts.

193
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,794
-Stop it.
-Come on!

194
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:16,629
Tap. Tap.

195
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:19,423
Goodnight.

196
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,227
Why are you glaring at us? It's scary.

197
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,021
He looks like he could kill
with just his glare.

198
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,525
Emotions are embedded within actions.

199
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,751
Did you go somewhere?

200
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:57,586
Did you meet someone?

201
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,171
No.

202
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,590
I just went out for a walk.

203
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:03,467
Liar.

204
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,892
DAD

205
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:31,537
DAD

206
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:36,542
Ye-na. Why do you keep
avoiding my calls?

207
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,337
You're with that jerk, aren't you?

208
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:43,257
You knew he woke up,

209
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,093
but you lied to me!

210
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,891
It's been a while, Mr. Suh.

211
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,979
You really came.

212
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,031
I thought I should at least come by.

213
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,659
I guess you aren't fully recovered.

214
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:12,912
My brain is fine.

215
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,956
I clearly remember things
I don't want to, too.

216
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,918
That's a relief, Mr. Nam.

217
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,587
"A relief"?

218
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:26,300
That's odd to hear from the man
who tried to kill me.

219
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,594
Why did you try to kill me?

220
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,763
Because I knew something about my father?

221
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:36,518
I came because of what you said
last night.

222
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:42,024
I don't understand what you meant at all.

223
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:43,943
You're lying again.

224
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:46,570
You knew why I had left.

225
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:50,199
That's why you sent someone
and made me like this.

226
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:52,618
One more thing.

227
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,538
Thanks to you, a ridiculous robot
made an entrance, too.

228
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:58,916
This is unfair.

229
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,253
I really didn't know why you had left.

230
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,297
I heard the guy who was following me died.

231
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,092
Murder disguised as a hit-and-run.

232
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:11,095
I heard that from Ye-na.

233
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:13,722
She's very well-informed
just like her dad.

234
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:15,808
You had Ye-na...

235
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,810
do something like that?

236
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,895
I didn't. She did it on her own.

237
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,816
She could die right this instant
if I told her to.

238
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:24,900
Didn't you know that?

239
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:31,615
I was just kidding.

240
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,575
You still have no sense of humor at all.

241
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,790
You have no sense of humor either.

242
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:47,006
Do you think I care about
my daughter, who betrayed me?

243
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,926
Why don't you test me if you want?

244
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,596
Now, you show your true colors.

245
00:16:56,765 --> 00:17:00,477
You'll have to worry
more about Ye-na's life.

246
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,982
Since she's the only person
who cares only about you.

247
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,778
Because Dr. Oh's other son is doing
such a great job...

248
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,323
at home and at the office.

249
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,243
"Other son"?

250
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:19,121
That ridiculous robot
you mentioned earlier.

251
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,832
Mr. Ji and the chairman...

252
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:25,002
seem to like him a lot.

253
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,964
It'll be quite a pain...

254
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,508
to replace that robot.

255
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,470
I'll see you around.

256
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,656
Let me ask you one last thing.

257
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,331
Do you really like that jerk?

258
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,083
I'm tired. Let's stop.

259
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,085
Even if he kills me?

260
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,378
You tried to kill him, too.

261
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,637
I'll erase every memory of you...

262
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,473
from the day you were born
to this very moment.

263
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,227
Now,

264
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:25,521
I have no daughter.

265
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:42,246
Why didn't you tell me
you called my dad here?

266
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,706
Don't you think about me at all?

267
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,750
Do you think I want to see you together?

268
00:18:48,085 --> 00:18:49,294
Why did you meet with him?

269
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,547
To talk about killing each other?

270
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,090
It would be better not to know.

271
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:55,050
I don't want to see you get hurt.

272
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,761
I betrayed my dad to come to you.

273
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,389
I have the right to know what's going on.

274
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,558
Whether I'm hurt by that or not...

275
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,143
is up to me to deal with.

276
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:06,103
So don't try to fool me anymore.

277
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,107
Sorry, Ye-na.

278
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,318
You know you're all I have.

279
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,739
Don't see my dad again.

280
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:24,830
What is this all about?

281
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,463
You called...

282
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,090
Mr. Suh here?

283
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,935
I had to find out something from him.

284
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,812
-What?
-Later.

285
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,148
I'll tell you later.

286
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,109
What are you thinking?

287
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,988
This happened to my son
because he came to see me,

288
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:00,782
but I feel like there's nothing
I can do for you.

289
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,828
I didn't go to see you.

290
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,665
-What?
-I didn't go there to see you.

291
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:10,375
I didn't see you for 20 years.

292
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,211
Why would I have wanted to see you?

293
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,755
I wanted to check something,

294
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,218
but once I saw that,
it all became meaningless.

295
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,888
I shouldn't have gone.

296
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,601
I should've just lived
without knowing anything.

297
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,119
Shin?

298
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,664
I told you before.

299
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,417
I'm sure Shin knows
something about Jung-woo.

300
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,921
That can't be possible.

301
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,006
How long will you do this?

302
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:02,469
"Because I knew something
about my father?"

303
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,471
That's exactly what he said.

304
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,848
He even went to the Czech
Republic for that.

305
00:21:14,147 --> 00:21:15,649
Why are you laughing?

306
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,359
My apologies.

307
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,737
I realized that it's a relief.

308
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:23,115
The fact that you,
who went through it with me,

309
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,075
are by my side...

310
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,119
is so encouraging.

311
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:29,705
Even if Shin digs it all up,

312
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,540
it doesn't worry me at all.

313
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:34,376
After all,

314
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,962
I was nothing but your puppet.

315
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,755
What was that?

316
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,717
I won't worry preemptively.

317
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:45,721
I'm sure you'll handle your own grandson.

318
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:49,599
Just like you did to your son.

319
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,771
I need to go.
I have work to do for the MediCar.

320
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,110
It's a project that
you're especially interested in.

321
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,237
I have to make it a success.

322
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:15,584
He nearly died.
What is he thinking?

323
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,431
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

324
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,224
Yes, I'll call.

325
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:32,893
Yes.

326
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:34,936
Bro!

327
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,902
Weren't you ever confused?

328
00:22:43,111 --> 00:22:44,863
You know me the best.

329
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,290
I said, "Bro," but you didn't get mad.

330
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,835
I called you that because
I won't be here much longer.

331
00:22:58,919 --> 00:22:59,836
May I do it again?

332
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,213
Please do as you please.

333
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,174
The chairman would like
to see you for lunch.

334
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:07,761
-Okay.
-I'll go up then.

335
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,810
Did I do something wrong?

336
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,728
His voice tone is different.

337
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,147
He's being cold on purpose.

338
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,400
I told you to ignore things like that.

339
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,569
He's trying keep his distance from you.

340
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:26,655
You shouldn't point it out like that.

341
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,171
Mr. Nam really sent the material.

342
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,048
This is a lot.

343
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:47,092
It's been translated and summarized, too.

344
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,718
How did he do this all by himself?

345
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,388
He's so mysterious.
Maybe he really is a robot.

346
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,599
Mr. Suh should've asked me first.

347
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,226
He threw down a doll...

348
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,395
and said Mr. Nam was a robot.

349
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,981
He must've wanted revenge
for calling off the wedding.

350
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,275
It didn't look like a doll to me.

351
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,278
Jin-soo. Let me see that again.

352
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,871
Isn't that mask under the skin...

353
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,873
exquisite for a doll?

354
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,333
Even Hollywood does this much.

355
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,461
They know the real technology
is impossible.

356
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,795
What's impossible?

357
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,518
"Man can do all."

358
00:24:39,227 --> 00:24:42,439
It's a logo that says
human can do everything.

359
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,650
This project will combine
our self-driving car,

360
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,653
the M-Car, along with the
new M-Car concept...

361
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,614
in order to accomplish...

362
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,115
the chairman's big picture.

363
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,534
People can accomplish anything.

364
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,162
They'll probably
make people like you too soon.

365
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,830
Wouldn't it be quicker... 

366
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,957
to make a robot that's
more human than them?

367
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,709
Don't you agree?

368
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,217
It's lunch time.

369
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:12,511
I'll turn it off again
if you pass the closing hour.

370
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,520
I saw a shrimp restaurant.

371
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,939
-Shrimp sounds good.
-Okay. We should go there then.

372
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:27,317
-But it's expensive there.
-We can spend that much.

373
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:32,155
Hello, ma'am.

374
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,908
I'm a bit late.

375
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:37,327
-Are you on your way to lunch?
-Yes.

376
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:38,995
Come with us.

377
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,164
Okay.

378
00:25:41,831 --> 00:25:43,625
It'll be my treat today.

379
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,345
Go ahead before me.
I'll be right there.

380
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,817
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

381
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,528
We should wait for Mr. Nam.

382
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:15,490
He's on a diet, so he's skipping lunch.

383
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,741
Let's just eat by ourselves.

384
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,578
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

385
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,955
-Please enjoy.
-We will.

386
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,804
For your headache.

387
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,806
You get them often, Mom.

388
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:41,349
Thanks.

389
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:46,146
You really look like mother-and-son now.

390
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,648
You must be a good son.

391
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,943
You seem like a completely
different person lately.

392
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:54,529
I'm saying we like it.

393
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,905
Of course I'm different.

394
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,241
Isn't that right, So-bong?

395
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,869
Yes, you're completely different.

396
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,955
Don't go back to how you used to be, okay?

397
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,834
I may. People always change.

398
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:11,880
No, sir. Our self-driving car team is
finally doing well.

399
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,633
I'm against it, too. It wasn't fun before.

400
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,887
If I suddenly change and act
awkward around you,

401
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:21,097
please follow Ms. Oh's orders.

402
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,225
She'll do her best for her son.

403
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,021
I have plans with the chairman.

404
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,815
So-bong, enjoy your lunch.

405
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:33,735
Thank you. I'll see you later.

406
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:50,960
MEDICINE

407
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,686
-Pardon?
-Why are you so surprised?

408
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:12,065
I asked when I should give
the company to Shin.

409
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,861
I never thought about it,
so I was caught off-guard.

410
00:28:17,487 --> 00:28:20,031
He has good momentum right now,

411
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,118
and he seems ready.
That's why I asked.

412
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,828
You must agree...

413
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:28,164
that the Shin now is better
than the Shin from before.

414
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,420
Why can't you answer me?

415
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,298
Do you think otherwise?

416
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,675
No, sir.

417
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,513
Good timing.

418
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:45,014
Sit down.

419
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,892
You didn't eat yet, right?

420
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:50,687
I did. I ate with my team.

421
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:58,194
I asked when
I should give you the company,

422
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,740
but he won't answer me.

423
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,283
I guess...

424
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,035
you haven't gained his trust yet.

425
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:18,006
I also believe he is better
prepared than before.

426
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,550
I think it will be better to
pass it on to him

427
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,968
as soon as possible.

428
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,597
I'm glad you feel the same way I do.

429
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,683
Let's find a way to hand it
over to him quietly...

430
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:31,060
without making a big fuss.

431
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,907
You didn't eat yet, right?

432
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,534
I did. I ate with my team.

433
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,790
Don't tell me... Is it him?

434
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,755
What are you doing?
Why are you drinking?

435
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:02,842
I haven't drunk in a while.
My head's spinning.

436
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,554
I'm hurt. How could you
not recognize me?

437
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,434
You're Shin.

438
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,311
That's right. I'm Shin.

439
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,147
Not the fake Shin
you're confused about. The real Shin.

440
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:35,208
You don't want to eat,
but you're drinking?

441
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,044
It's been a while since
I last saw you drink.

442
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,672
Does it taste good?

443
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:44,384
Yes. It's not bad for something you drink.

444
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,135
You always drank cheap stuff.

445
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:50,265
I've gotten old,

446
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,767
so my stomach isn't as strong.

447
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:55,144
Young-hoon.

448
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,355
Would you excuse us?

449
00:30:58,064 --> 00:31:00,441
I have a lot to say with him today.

450
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,321
What are you waiting for?

451
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,240
Didn't you hear him?

452
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:11,870
Yes, sir.

453
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:37,687
Drink only as much as you can handle.

454
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,533
Was Dad a good drinker?

455
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,827
Do I take after him?

456
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:54,871
This is unusual.

457
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:59,083
You never talked about your dad.

458
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,169
What kind of a son was he?

459
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,212
Were you sad when he died?

460
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,758
I was not sad.

461
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,552
I can't be sad.

462
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,264
A parent who buries their child...

463
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,934
has no right to be sad.

464
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,437
But...

465
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,773
why do you ask?

466
00:32:23,024 --> 00:32:25,693
As I draw closer to my dad's age
when I last saw him,

467
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,489
I wonder what he lived for
when he died.

468
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,032
I became curious.

469
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,077
What do you live for?

470
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,329
What is it...

471
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:39,040
that you truly want?

472
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,042
You know.

473
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:43,586
I want your company.

474
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,421
What will you do with it?

475
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,424
I'll chop it up into pieces
and sell them off.

476
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,178
What?

477
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,430
Just kidding.

478
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:58,267
It's like your life.
I couldn't possibly sell it.

479
00:33:01,688 --> 00:33:02,814
Pour me another.

480
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,566
I feel like I've just overcome death.

481
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,735
I think I should have
at least three shots.

482
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,235
Let's talk.

483
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:56,534
What are you trying to pull?

484
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,371
I wanted to see if you badmouth me
behind my back.

485
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:04,417
Who are you to decide whether
I get what's mine or not?

486
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,504
It's not like that.

487
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,300
Even if you return,
you'll need time to adjust.

488
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,137
It's yours anyway.
It's good to get it ahead of time.

489
00:34:16,304 --> 00:34:17,555
Who says I need it?

490
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:20,058
-What?
-Did I say I need it?

491
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,686
You can't say that.

492
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:26,939
You know everyone went
crazy because of you.

493
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,941
You're right.

494
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,027
All of you had a robot to replace me.

495
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:36,115
-Shin.
-Did you think I'd thank you?

496
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,243
When did I ever want Grandpa's position?

497
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:43,664
Maybe you're the one who wants it.

498
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:46,959
-Since you'll get more if I'm a chairman.
-Enough!

499
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,217
What's wrong with you?

500
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,762
I did all sorts of things to protect you.

501
00:34:58,054 --> 00:34:59,639
That's how we got to where we are.

502
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,849
How could you say that?

503
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,269
Do you want to hear that
you're worse than a robot?

504
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,355
Please get your act together.

505
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,901
I'm worse than a robot?

506
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:22,078
I got too worked up.

507
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,206
You're not even well.

508
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,376
Shin.

509
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:31,045
Don't come after me.

510
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:46,602
You really seem like Shin...

511
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:48,437
when you're in his clothes like that.

512
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:52,191
Thanks for agreeing to the sudden request.

513
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,278
Shin must've really
wanted to see his grandpa.

514
00:35:57,196 --> 00:35:59,448
Are you my watch dog?

515
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,869
Why would I watch you?

516
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:06,038
You can't both be out there
at the same time.

517
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,795
Hi, Shin. Where are you?

518
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,674
I'm almost there. I'll be there soon.

519
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,900
Something fun just came up.

520
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:35,902
Wait a little longer.

521
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,556
One Americano, please.

522
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,767
Okay. Wait a few minutes.

523
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,377
What are you doing?
Who said you could come out?

524
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:37,588
I noticed your GPS was drawing
closer to So-bong's.

525
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:39,882
You can't come out until I go back.

526
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,260
What's it to you whom I meet
and what I do?

527
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,804
I permitted it because you
wanted to see Grandpa.

528
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,265
What? "Permitted it"?

529
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,351
I concluded it was improper
to suddenly give an order,

530
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:53,646
but I assumed you missed your family,
so I accepted it.

531
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,648
However, So-bong is different.

532
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,025
I am simply pretending to be you.

533
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,152
You and So-bong have nothing
to do with each other.

534
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,323
So-bong is my person and mine alone.

535
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,744
Don't show up like this again.

536
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:23,301
So-bong.

537
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,022
What are you doing here?

538
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,065
So?

539
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:41,152
Shin showed up and
asked to swap clothes, so you did.

540
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,904
And you were locked in
Ms. Suh's car while he was out?

541
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:50,077
You may get angry.
You have every right to.

542
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:53,205
No. I won't get mad at you.

543
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,876
It's wrong to be emotional to you
when you can't feel emotions.

544
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,419
If I want to understand you,

545
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:00,921
I must be rational
and reasonable like you.

546
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,095
Are you okay?

547
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:12,558
I can't do it.
I'm just an emotional human.

548
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,478
I'm angry.
I'm so angry that it drives me crazy.

549
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,607
Don't smile.

550
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,443
I don't like that jerk mistreating you.

551
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:25,696
You have to hide
whenever that jerk comes out.

552
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,281
You did nothing wrong.

553
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,116
I hate seeing you being treated like that.

554
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,953
It must've been so uncomfortable
in Ms. Suh's car.

555
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:34,997
I should've been with you...

556
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:38,459
so that I can hit her
if she treats you like an object.

557
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:41,253
You're pretty.

558
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,005
What?

559
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,383
That's what I would've said
if I were a human.

560
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,302
You're pretty, So-bong.

561
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,139
What...

562
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:54,433
If you were a human,

563
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:57,436
what about me would you have
thought as pretty?

564
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,066
Answer me.

565
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:13,160
-What is it?
-Quit right now.

566
00:40:14,787 --> 00:40:17,415
My fiancee doesn't like you
being with my face.

567
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,877
I heard there's a manual override
to control that thing you love.

568
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,714
If you don't quit,
I'll put that on him. So quit.

569
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:28,676
Happy?

570
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,638
I didn't want to see So-bong.

571
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,933
I find it silly to like a robot.
I wanted to tease her.

572
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,269
Why is it funny?
Why would you tease her?

573
00:40:38,477 --> 00:40:40,438
That's all interest.

574
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,649
Ye-na.

575
00:40:45,484 --> 00:40:47,486
Do that again, and I'll make you pay.

576
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:53,742
Who was it? Why were you so serious?

577
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,704
Ms. Suh.

578
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,623
She thanked you for
letting him meet his grandpa.

579
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,334
She already thanked me earlier.

580
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:03,836
-She did?
-Yes.

581
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,046
I guess she wanted to say it again.

582
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,215
Let's go.

583
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,051
You have to tell me
what about me is pretty tomorrow.

584
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,428
Okay.

585
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,399
You're right.

586
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,359
All of you had a robot to replace me.

587
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,571
Did you think I'd thank you?

588
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,699
When did I ever want Grandpa's position?

589
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:38,245
Maybe you're the one who wants it.

590
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,677
-When did you get here?
-3 minutes 47 seconds ago.

591
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,388
You're always so exact.

592
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,309
Earlier today,

593
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:03,896
I saw Shin at the office.

594
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:07,650
How much of the human Nam Shin's
favors must I do?

595
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,362
Must I do it even if it's something bad?

596
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,867
It may be bad to me, but good for him.

597
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,161
That won't happen.

598
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:23,165
What's right or wrong isn't
all that complicated.

599
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:27,127
Humans complicate it for their own gain.

600
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:31,423
If you conclude it's bad,
it's bad for Shin, too,

601
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,884
so refuse it at least for his sake.

602
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,472
Thank you so much for
trusting my judgment.

603
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,977
Are you distancing yourself from me?

604
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,939
Can't we meet again in the future?

605
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,138
I'm a robot, too.

606
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,641
Do you still like me?

607
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:28,439
Shin?

608
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,282
Where is he?

609
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,533
Hee-dong!

610
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,286
Hee-dong!

611
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,912
Where did he go?

612
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,876
Was he in your room again?

613
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,298
Put him down over here.

614
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,695
Thanks. I'll make sure
he doesn't go there again.

615
00:44:16,779 --> 00:44:18,030
There's no need.

616
00:44:18,697 --> 00:44:20,115
Let him play whenever he wants.

617
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:23,202
Stop giving him hope.

618
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,163
Don't act close to him.

619
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:29,541
You and he will grow apart with time.

620
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:33,003
As he get older,
you'll think he's after what's yours.

621
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,422
What does that have to do
with playing in my room?

622
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:37,966
-What?
-Whatever happens later on,

623
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,552
is it bad for him to play in my room?

624
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,098
It isn't bad, but...

625
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,974
Don't worry about the future.

626
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,269
It's more important for kids
to play when they can.

627
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,481
You should play with him
in my room, too.

628
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,069
Hi, Dad.

629
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,243
Shin, let's talk.

630
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,465
What do you live for?

631
00:45:19,508 --> 00:45:21,135
What is it that you truly want?

632
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:23,554
You know.

633
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,305
I want your company.

634
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:27,349
What will you do with it?

635
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,144
I'll chop it up into pieces
and sell them off.

636
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,647
What...

637
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,985
do you live for?

638
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:43,365
What is it that you truly want?

639
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,578
I don't want anything.

640
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,790
I'm sure.

641
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,711
Since you never had any ambition.

642
00:45:57,504 --> 00:45:58,797
That's not what I mean.

643
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,760
Wanting something...

644
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,970
means you lack the strength to take it.

645
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,140
So?

646
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:10,225
I have the strength to take it all.

647
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:13,187
Be it wisdom,
physical strength, or information.

648
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:16,315
As in, you can have
anything you set your mind to,

649
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:18,484
so there's no need...

650
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:21,862
to want anything In the first place?

651
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:24,031
Yes.

652
00:46:24,615 --> 00:46:26,742
I simply don't use that strength
since I don't need to.

653
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:31,622
You rude jerk.

654
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,457
I only spoke the truth.

655
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,417
So did I.

656
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:39,880
Because even if you are rude,
I can't complain.

657
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,177
Do you really...

658
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:49,389
have no desire to live as my grandson?

659
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,687
I'm sure my question sounded strange.

660
00:46:57,314 --> 00:47:01,401
Since you already are
my grandson in every way.

661
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:06,865
You may go.

662
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,754
You simply don't use that strength...

663
00:47:22,172 --> 00:47:23,966
since you don't need to?

664
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,061
CHAMPION GYM

665
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,985
My fiancee doesn't like you
being with my face.

666
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,279
I hear there's a manual override...

667
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:48,115
to control that thing you love.

668
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:50,701
If you don't quit, I'll put that on him.

669
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,077
So quit.

670
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,665
Wicked brat.

671
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,384
Why did you put this on me?

672
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,720
You're a bad daughter to me.

673
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,513
I know I am.

674
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:56,099
That's why I won't apologize either.

675
00:48:57,059 --> 00:49:00,103
-What?
-I never did what you told me to,

676
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:01,605
and I probably won't.

677
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,233
Listen to her. She's so arrogant.

678
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:08,028
Sure, you wouldn't be my daughter...

679
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,821
if you listened to me.

680
00:49:09,905 --> 00:49:11,365
So give it up.

681
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,533
I won't break up with him.

682
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:17,037
Why are you just like me?

683
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:20,791
Couldn't you be different?

684
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,586
Couldn't you be different from me?

685
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,130
That's nothing good.

686
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,758
You're equally as stupid,

687
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,052
pigheaded, and frustrating.

688
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,722
If you think it's wrong, turn away.

689
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:38,475
If you think you'll get hurt, turn around.

690
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:42,270
Even if I couldn't do it,

691
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:45,857
can't you live like that, So-bong?

692
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:49,569
I tried really hard to not like him.

693
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:54,241
But I just couldn't.

694
00:49:57,619 --> 00:49:58,870
Fine. Sure.

695
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,456
If my daughter was clever,

696
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,166
she would've left a long time ago.

697
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:07,129
This is all my fault.

698
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:09,798
It's my fault...

699
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,300
for making you a stupid fool.

700
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,220
Dad.

701
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,889
Don't you do this, too.

702
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:21,226
Everyone tells me...

703
00:50:22,102 --> 00:50:23,437
to leave him.

704
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:27,024
They threaten me and tell me
to stop guarding him.

705
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:31,862
I know I shouldn't do this to you,

706
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,281
but still.

707
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:38,493
Can't you not do this to me?

708
00:50:41,913 --> 00:50:44,624
I want to stay with him, Dad.

709
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,879
I want to stay with him
until the very end.

710
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,055
It's okay. It's okay. Stop crying.

711
00:50:58,638 --> 00:50:59,639
Stop crying.

712
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:02,809
Stop crying.

713
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,731
I won't stop you...

714
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,274
or cheer you on.

715
00:51:10,067 --> 00:51:11,109
But...

716
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,112
don't do anything...

717
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:16,823
that will get you hurt.

718
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,535
If you get hurt,

719
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:25,707
I'll break that little punk.

720
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,715
Dad...

721
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,477
The sun feels good.

722
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,438
I hope it's just as sunny...

723
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,775
on the day I die.

724
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,152
Why are you saying that?

725
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:56,279
Everyone grows old and dies.

726
00:51:57,614 --> 00:52:00,075
That's human life.
You get old, get sick, and you die.

727
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:04,704
My body will rot,
but there's nothing I can do.

728
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:07,582
I'm worried about the company though.

729
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,168
You have Shin,

730
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:11,837
so you don't need to worry.

731
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,674
Do you trust that punk?

732
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:17,968
Which Shin?

733
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,221
The old Shin,

734
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,597
or the new Shin?

735
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,435
I trust you...

736
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:32,023
more than I trust him.

737
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:34,151
Putting blood aside...

738
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,319
and judging objectively,

739
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:40,574
you're the only one...

740
00:52:42,617 --> 00:52:43,952
who won't ruin my company.

741
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,872
-Sir.
-What?

742
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:49,249
Do you feel guilty toward Shin? Or...

743
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,295
are you offended that
I treat you like Jong-gil?

744
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:57,174
Cast off all of those cumbersome emotions,

745
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:58,466
and judge.

746
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:01,761
Who's perfect to replace me?

747
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:04,931
You.

748
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:11,771
Yes, I am.

749
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:15,025
I'm confident, and I want it, too.

750
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,570
But I only think about it.

751
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:20,488
I don't want to strive for it.

752
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,909
May I ask why?

753
00:53:25,785 --> 00:53:27,495
I don't want to live like you.

754
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:32,792
-What?
-If I want to feed my greed,

755
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:36,463
I must cast off my own son and grandson...

756
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,256
and suspect everyone like you do.

757
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,301
Does a life like that make you happy, sir?

758
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:47,432
You seem very unhappy in my eyes.

759
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:50,936
I don't want to live like that.

760
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:55,523
I was lonely all my life,
so I don't want to hurt Shin,

761
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,984
who was also lonely all his life.

762
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:01,363
I don't want to make you nervous either.

763
00:54:02,155 --> 00:54:03,490
You don't say it,

764
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:06,034
but you're always
afraid someone will pass you.

765
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:11,331
I'd rather want less
and live a happy life.

766
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:14,918
I'll take care of Shin and serve you...

767
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,002
to be less lonely.

768
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:19,673
Loser.

769
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,425
Yes, I am a loser.

770
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,344
I'll be leaving then.

771
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:26,388
Young-hoon.

772
00:54:30,475 --> 00:54:33,061
What is that punk to you?

773
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,940
That punk? Who...

774
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,654
The robot that looks like Shin.

775
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,078
BOXING GYM
CHAMPION GYM

776
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:59,254
Dad. I told you.

777
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:00,630
You can't stop me.

778
00:55:02,090 --> 00:55:06,344
Gosh, you stupid fool.
You're so absentminded.

779
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,645
Thank you.

780
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:20,108
I'm going to see the person
who told me to quit.

781
00:55:20,859 --> 00:55:23,069
I'll say I will never quit.

782
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,947
Do whatever you want. Go.

783
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,201
I'll be back, sir.

784
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:42,630
My daughter's so pretty.

785
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,924
Who is it?

786
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:52,057
I came to see Nam Shin.

787
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,378
This must feel like Mom's womb to you.

788
00:56:22,670 --> 00:56:24,297
You were made in a room like this.

789
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,633
So-bong will not quit.

790
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,301
I came to tell you that.

791
00:56:29,511 --> 00:56:30,512
Did she tattle?

792
00:56:30,595 --> 00:56:33,473
No. I can hear everything
through the phone.

793
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:35,558
I have hypersensitive sight and hearing.

794
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:41,356
She's your guard.
You're not her agent.

795
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:43,691
I spoke to her. Why are you stepping in?

796
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,194
She has nothing to do with you.

797
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,155
Only I can make my guard quit.

798
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,409
You forgot you were made to replace me.

799
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:55,495
You just have to do what I tell you do.

800
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:00,834
Are you having a date here?

801
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,004
Why are you both here?

802
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,673
He's here?

803
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,592
Why must I do that?

804
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,304
-What?
-You must be confused.

805
00:57:13,721 --> 00:57:16,266
I'm helping you.
You don't control me.

806
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,309
You can ask me for favors,

807
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,894
but you can't order me around.

808
00:57:20,437 --> 00:57:23,523
If you want something, ask nicely.

809
00:57:23,773 --> 00:57:25,066
Don't make threats.

810
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:28,653
No. I enjoy making threats than requests.

811
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:33,950
You have no emotions,
so threats don't work.

812
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:36,786
Then what must I mess
with for you to obey?

813
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,080
What's the most precious to you?

814
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,374
Is it So-bong?

815
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,338
Don't touch So-bong.

816
00:57:48,006 --> 00:57:50,300
-Ever.
-How dare you threaten me?

817
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:03,730
Are you insane? What are you doing?

818
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,565
He's more disgusting because he's fine.

819
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:07,692
He can't feel pain or emotions.

820
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,569
Stop it!

821
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:12,363
You'll get hurt. Stand behind me.

822
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,074
Are you kidding me?

823
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,619
You must really think you're human.

824
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,663
Watch. See who's really human.

825
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,095
No!

826
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,915
You were always Nam Shin,
and you still are.

827
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:47,292
Do you like him that much?

828
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,002
What exactly is the manual override mode?

829
00:59:49,085 --> 00:59:50,878
-Why are you doing this?
-It's not about Shin.

830
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,005
Talk about yourself.

831
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,090
Does Grandpa know about me?

832
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,385
