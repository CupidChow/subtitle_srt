1
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,825
How dare you lie to me?

2
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,536
When a jerk like this...

3
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,831
acted like this, I knew something was off.

4
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:42,917
The rule is to hug you if you cry.

5
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,753
Hug me when I cry? What garbage.

6
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:46,504
Have you gone mad?

7
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,970
He shows up like Superman and saves me.

8
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,806
I have no heart.

9
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,600
He says these lines like some superhero.

10
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,435
But I don't have a heart.

11
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:01,561
Again.

12
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,980
How could a person not have a heart?

13
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,900
What are you doing? You'll go up there?

14
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,277
Have you lost your mind?
Aren't you scared?

15
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,030
I don't know that stuff.
I have no emotions.

16
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,823
How could a person not have emotions?

17
00:01:13,948 --> 00:01:15,742
Mr. Nam. Mr. Nam!

18
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,998
He's definitely hiding something.

19
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,379
No!

20
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,193
Mr. Nam, are you okay?

21
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:53,154
Your face! You're hurt!

22
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,657
Are you hurt anywhere else? Are you okay?

23
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,150
Don't come any closer.

24
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,069
Don't come near me.
Don't come near me!

25
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,122
Shin! Get her!

26
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,793
-Let go! What is this?
-Get her over here.

27
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,628
-Excuse me.
-What?

28
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,340
Hey! Let me go!

29
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,426
Let go!

30
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,026
What do you think of the incident?

31
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,278
Do you admit the self-driving car test
was a failure?

32
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,488
Will you stop PK's future project?

33
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:20,074
Where's Nam Shin,
the man in charge of the project?

34
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,118
Is he destroying evidence?

35
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,536
-Answer us!
-Tell us!

36
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,039
-Tell us the truth!
-Is he destroying evidence?

37
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,415
Please tell us!

38
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,502
Will the self-driving car
project be canned?

39
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,547
What will happen now?

40
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,594
Tell us what you plan to do.

41
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,346
Please give us a statement.

42
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,894
-Get her, Shin.
-Yes, Mom.

43
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,647
Let go. Let go!

44
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,400
What are you? Just what are you?

45
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,904
It's nice to meet you.
I'm an AI robot named Nam Shin III.

46
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:01,241
AI Robot? Like a robot?

47
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,621
Let go. I don't care what you are.
Let go!

48
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,123
-Shin, hold on to her.
-Who are you...

49
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,336
You're Mr. Nam's mom
from the hospital, right?

50
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,088
I'll explain when we get there.

51
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,423
-Don't let go of her until then.
-Yes, Mom.

52
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,926
Let go. Let go of me!

53
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,018
He wasn't human.

54
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,646
How disgusting.

55
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,128
It hurts. Let go!

56
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:15,023
You were in on it too.

57
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:25,241
My son. You don't feel pain,

58
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,909
but why does it break my heart?

59
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,289
You must be happy
to see your son like this.

60
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,001
Don't do that David. Mom's upset.

61
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,502
No.

62
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,547
No matter how much I like her,
I'll say that if she's wrong.

63
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,218
Sorry, Mom.
It's my fault that we got caught.

64
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,845
It's okay.

65
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:49,599
-I asked you to do it. I'm sorry.
-My gosh.

66
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,934
I haven't heard such
a sweet conversation in a while.

67
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,856
Anyway, I wonder
how things are going with her.

68
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,819
Someone hired her.

69
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:05,615
It was Suh Jong-gil, the director.

70
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:13,081
Don't resent her.

71
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,583
I threatened her with you
to make her talk.

72
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,211
So?

73
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,296
Are you threatening me now?

74
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,758
That's right.

75
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,010
I was hired by Mr. Suh.

76
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:30,181
But I didn't know you were
hiding something this huge.

77
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,933
Please don't tell Mr. Suh.

78
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,393
Work with us instead.

79
00:06:33,976 --> 00:06:36,354
-What?
-We'll pay whatever you want.

80
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:39,899
Please help us hide Mr. Nam's identity.

81
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,026
Mr. Nam?

82
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:45,738
Are you still putting on an act?

83
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,615
Even if they look the same...

84
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,244
Where's the real Mr. Nam?

85
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,208
A con is run by a person.
How could that thing...

86
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,336
I can't believe it.

87
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,465
I'll make you believe it.

88
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,802
What's wrong with you? Let go of me.

89
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,637
Let go of me.

90
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,121
This is my real son.

91
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,415
My son...

92
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,668
was run over by a truck
before my very eyes.

93
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,963
I finally held him after 20 years,

94
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,300
but he was limp and bloody.

95
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,637
Suh Jong-gil may have
staged that accident too.

96
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,932
He's a cruel man.
He'd smile if he saw him like this.

97
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:00,021
Shin will wake up.

98
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,523
He'll wake up at least to see me.

99
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,776
Please...

100
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:08,696
help me until then, So-bong.

101
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,201
Why are you doing this?

102
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,287
How could I possibly help?

103
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,080
Make sure Mr. Suh's people
don't find out.

104
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,216
Please.

105
00:08:34,138 --> 00:08:35,181
GOLD MINE

106
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,660
Hello, Mr. Suh.

107
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,248
No. I can meet you now.

108
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,253
Yes. I'll see you there.

109
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:11,008
Mr. Suh is the most
dangerous threat to Shin.

110
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,761
-You can't go.
-And if I insist?

111
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,265
Will you make him kill me?

112
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,397
Please don't go.

113
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,572
I'm begging you.

114
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,324
What do you want?

115
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:38,286
Is money not enough?

116
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,289
I'll give you my flesh and bones.

117
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,041
I'll give you every ounce.

118
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,127
Please...

119
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,713
help me and Shin.

120
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,299
Please.

121
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:56,095
Dr. Oh, stop it.

122
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,514
Shin can still hear you back there.

123
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,948
I'm supposed to hug you if you cry, Mom.

124
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,764
Let go of me. You're all insane.

125
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,557
How could you make up such a big lie?

126
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,060
Aren't you afraid of being caught?

127
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,395
We are. But Shin is what matters to us.

128
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:56,238
Who would believe me even if I told them?

129
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,157
Can you trust me even if I take money?

130
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,576
What if I take your money
and tell everyone?

131
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,457
A person's life is at stake.

132
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,466
I'll pretend I didn't see any robot.

133
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,513
If you don't trust me, follow me.

134
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,100
This is a risk you must take
at some point anyway.

135
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,659
Yes. Mr. Suh is available.

136
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,704
Okay. Please give me a call tomorrow.

137
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,539
Okay.

138
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,042
It was the TV news.

139
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,753
They want an interview
about the self-driving car test.

140
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,673
You told them who the target is, right?

141
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,008
I made sure they know about that.

142
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,928
I'll go after meeting with So-bong.

143
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,305
Leak information about Shin to the media.

144
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,016
A greedy brat...

145
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,393
with no experience.

146
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,020
Make sure that's his image.

147
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,231
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

148
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:30,207
More.

149
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,084
More.

150
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,339
What? Is there a law
against filling up a wine glass?

151
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:38,966
No, sir.

152
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,062
So-bong.

153
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,653
Please.

154
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,156
You're making me...

155
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,950
feel like I'm an important person now.

156
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,620
Wait here.

157
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,226
How's Shin?

158
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,021
I was so upset...

159
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,149
that I finished an entire bottle of wine.

160
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,570
I heard only the car
was left at the scene.

161
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,156
Just what happened?

162
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,325
When the self-driving car
went out of control,

163
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,494
it must have reminded him
of his car accident.

164
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,455
Mr. Nam seems a bit traumatized.

165
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,625
Mr. Ji came, so I left.

166
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,335
Is that really all?

167
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,295
Did you leave the scene...

168
00:13:58,462 --> 00:14:00,214
and come straight here?

169
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:06,846
Mr. Suh is the most
dangerous threat to Shin.

170
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,931
Suh Jong-gil may have
staged that accident too.

171
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:12,518
He's a cruel man.
He'd smile if he saw him like this.

172
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,480
Tell me whatever it is.

173
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,025
I need to know in order to fix it.

174
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:23,237
Do you...

175
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:25,573
need more money?

176
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:27,783
Money?

177
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,452
I like money.

178
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,163
It's really good.

179
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:35,457
However,

180
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,585
what must I find out?

181
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,629
How much do you want me to find out...

182
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:42,506
for your daughter's marriage?

183
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,052
So-bong.

184
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:51,265
Are you naive, or are you acting naive?

185
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,977
You should be able to tell
what I'm after by now.

186
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,856
I hired you...

187
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,025
not just for my daughter,

188
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,568
but for me.

189
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,821
Stop acting naive,

190
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,907
and find out...

191
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,617
what I want.

192
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,828
It's nice to have you
being honest with me.

193
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,957
But why must I go that far?

194
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,466
Because you're already on my side.

195
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,802
It's too late to pull out now.

196
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,143
Watch carefully.

197
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,271
This is what happens
when you do something on your own.

198
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:43,651
If I didn't stop the self-driving car,
a huge accident would've occurred.

199
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,280
So?

200
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,991
What if So-bong tells him
everything she saw?

201
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,788
Along with Shin and I,
Dr. Oh will be in danger.

202
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,499
Do you still think you were right?

203
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:04,004
Humans decide differently
according to the situation.

204
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,091
Complicated decisions
are too tough for you,

205
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,468
so please listen to me
unconditionally from now on.

206
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,894
I'll be right back.

207
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:46,547
I think I just refused enough money
to change my life.

208
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,425
Seeing your face is making me
start to regret it.

209
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,884
I'll do anything you need.

210
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,511
Anything within my power.

211
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,680
No, even if it isn't,

212
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,016
I'll do my best to make it happen.

213
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,728
But why are you going this far?

214
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:02,980
He isn't your brother or relative.

215
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,482
I don't understand why you're doing this.

216
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,072
I...

217
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,324
like working for Shin.

218
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,910
Regardless of what others say,

219
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,662
I like being by his side.

220
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,956
You are a rare loyal friend.

221
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,794
Anyway, I lied to Mr. Suh
that nothing happened...

222
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,714
and I'd continue to spy
on Mr. Nam for him,

223
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,175
so you have to protect me from now on.

224
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:33,302
Thank you, So-bong.

225
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,979
How could I have been fooled by him?

226
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:47,691
He's so cheerful.
He's totally different from Mr. Nam.

227
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,545
That's great.

228
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:14,218
It went well.

229
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:16,428
They're heading home now.

230
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,311
Dr. Oh.

231
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:26,980
Let's take them both and leave.

232
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:29,483
Let's live there, just the four of us.

233
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,568
Since Shin's identity has been found out,

234
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,404
going back won't undo it.

235
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,283
It's too late to turn back.

236
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,911
I will...

237
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,288
protect Shin's place until the end.

238
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,763
If she was digging
into Mr. Nam's life on her own,

239
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:01,557
she'll pay the consequences.

240
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:08,480
Sweetie. Why aren't you calling?

241
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,692
You're not in jail already, are you?

242
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,572
Who is it? Aren't you the reporter?

243
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,740
CHAMPION GYM

244
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,954
Did So-bong come here?

245
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,623
Mr. Kang cut ties with her.

246
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,792
He says she's no longer his daughter.

247
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,294
Why are you here?

248
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,171
Mr. Kang scrapped the dieting program...

249
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,591
because she learned
bad habits while training you.

250
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,176
Leave before he comes.

251
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:38,594
Fine.

252
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,596
-I'm out.
-Fine.

253
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,322
Dad. What are you doing?

254
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,489
Dad?

255
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,284
I don't have a disgusting
daughter like you!

256
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,785
I'm So-bong's friend.

257
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:06,663
-My friend's dad is my dad.
-Friend? As if!

258
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,207
Why did you come?

259
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,500
Did you come to be a bad influence again?

260
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,711
What do you mean? "Bad influence"?

261
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:17,090
So-bong shaped up and is working
as Mr. Nam's personal bodyguard now.

262
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,884
That boss, Mr. Nam?

263
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,470
Did you send her in to take more pictures?

264
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,013
I did not!

265
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:25,807
She went in voluntarily
to repay his kindness!

266
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,393
She'd never voluntarily
repay anyone's kindness!

267
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,271
I can't breathe. Please let go!

268
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,397
Seriously!

269
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,400
-Call. I have a call.
-You.

270
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:36,610
Promise me.

271
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,238
Promise you'll never
see my daughter again!

272
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,411
Dad!

273
00:20:52,501 --> 00:20:53,919
Go get her.

274
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:08,183
Hey, Sweetie. Where are you?

275
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,062
You're with Mr. Ji? Mr. Nam too?

276
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,815
Are they going to fire you?
Will they press charges?

277
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,358
Did they hit you by any chance?

278
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:18,235
If you were so worried,

279
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:20,654
how could you tell Mr. Ji about Mr. Suh?

280
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:23,490
I had no choice. I'm sorry.

281
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:29,454
First, I settled things with Mr. Ji,

282
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,708
so act like nothing
happened if Mr. Suh calls.

283
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,419
You settled it?
How did you settle it?

284
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:40,048
What is it? Did Mr. Ji say he'll ignore
that you're working for Mr. Suh?

285
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,425
Why?

286
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,845
I had an incredibly shocking day today.

287
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:48,390
I'm tired and drained,
so let's talk later.

288
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,684
Incredibly shocking?

289
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,104
Something happened, right?
Where are you? I'm coming.

290
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,773
You're not coming anywhere. Bye.

291
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,567
Sweetie!

292
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,675
It gives me chills just to think about it.

293
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,012
Bathroom.

294
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,100
So-bong.

295
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,231
What's wrong?

296
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:39,816
Are you scared of me?

297
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,779
No. Why would I be scared?

298
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,492
The hidden camera in here is yours, right?

299
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,792
Uncanny valley.
It's a natural response.

300
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,170
Humans are offended
and upset when the see a robot

301
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:01,838
that somewhat looks human.

302
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,926
But I'm not "somewhat" like a human.
I completely look like a human.

303
00:23:06,426 --> 00:23:08,261
You completely fell for it too.

304
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:10,347
Then goodnight.

305
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:20,941
What is his deal?

306
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,130
Sorry for coming by this late.

307
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,090
I needed to make something clear.

308
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,676
-What is it?
-You can't tell anyone what you saw...

309
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,719
even to your family or friends.

310
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,807
If any strange rumor starts,
it'll be your fault.

311
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,768
Do you not trust me?

312
00:23:56,852 --> 00:23:59,062
Not you. I don't trust humans.

313
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:00,856
Don't do anything to gain suspicion.

314
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,777
-I understand, please leave.
-So-bong.

315
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,530
-I told you I understand.
-Thank you.

316
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,284
Thank you for deciding
to do something difficult.

317
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,871
Thanks to you,
I can finally sleep tonight.

318
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,332
I hope you sleep well too.

319
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,385
Why is everyone telling me to sleep?

320
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,054
Would you guys be able
to sleep if you were me?

321
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,519
I guess I'm not leaving today.

322
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,483
Yes. I am very sorry
for the traumatizing experience...

323
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,613
caused to everyone at the scene
due to the unforeseen events.

324
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:54,493
I'll be straightforward.

325
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,955
Will you keep insisting
on the self-driving car?

326
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,290
Well,

327
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,628
safety and security are top priorities...

328
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,671
when developing self-driving cars.

329
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:09,341
We admit the person
in charge of preventing hacks

330
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:12,010
should have been more attentive and ready.

331
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,971
The person in charge? Wouldn't that...

332
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:16,890
be Mr. Nam Shin?

333
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,852
He was criticized for going into hiding...

334
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,687
without fixing the situation.

335
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,691
Mr. Suh has that news anchor
in his back pocket.

336
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:28,527
Why do you keep watching, Dad?

337
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,403
I'm sorry, Grandpa.

338
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:33,907
How could you run away
just because things went sour?

339
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,410
You should look failure in the eye

340
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,497
and make it clear to everyone

341
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,916
that you'll succeed next time!

342
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:46,586
What will you do now?

343
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,048
Jong-gil is out there creating waves.
What now?

344
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,299
It's my fault.

345
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,803
I will make the test drive
a success somehow.

346
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,932
Young-hoon, you take responsibility

347
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,935
and salvage the self-driving car project.

348
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:06,773
If I leave it to him,
he'll ruin the company!

349
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:07,983
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

350
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:11,069
And later, you should go
to the executive meeting

351
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,071
and take all insults they spew at you!

352
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,241
Get out.

353
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,918
This killed the Chairman's trust in Shin.

354
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:30,255
Mr. Suh announced
that he'd prevent hacking as well.

355
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,631
I saw it too.

356
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,177
I'll confirm that after checking out
the self-driving car myself.

357
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:40,307
If Shin is next to you, just listen.

358
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:45,312
He can't go near
the self-driving car until I get there.

359
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,105
Don't let him go near it.

360
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,484
I'll explain the reason later.

361
00:26:56,698 --> 00:26:58,617
I can find out the hacking route.

362
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,452
-Should I try?
-Don't rush.

363
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:02,537
Let's watch how things go and move slowly.

364
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,292
Stick to So-bong for the time being.

365
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,836
We can't trust her 100 percent yet.

366
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:29,939
PK GROUP

367
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,107
Me?

368
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,693
Why would I go into the conference room?

369
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:36,404
In case I do something?

370
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,657
In case they ask questions...

371
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,535
regarding the accident
during the test drive.

372
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,456
-That's right.
-Gosh.

373
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,718
Mr. Suh. Thank you
for cleaning up the situation for me.

374
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:02,055
Not at all. I'm glad you aren't hurt.

375
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,765
Did you watch the news?

376
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,810
Thanks to his humble attitude,

377
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:09,771
our ruined company image was fixed.

378
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,107
Come on. Don't say that.

379
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,692
What?

380
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,277
You answered even
the difficult questions easily.

381
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,405
You looked great on the screen as well.

382
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,659
The chairman is coming.

383
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,347
I'm sorry.

384
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,225
My carelessness
caused the company great harm.

385
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:49,644
Public disgrace and a drop in stock price.

386
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,647
The public outrage as well.
This is very serious.

387
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,941
And because you ran away,

388
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,193
you became the face of irresponsibility.

389
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,822
He did not run away.
He needed rest due to the shock.

390
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,323
Does that excuse his actions?

391
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,493
He should've run around trying to fix it,

392
00:29:05,952 --> 00:29:07,328
but he needed rest?

393
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,580
That's right.

394
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:10,832
The company will look
bad if we let this slide.

395
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:13,710
The person in charge
should step down to fix this.

396
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,503
I'm sure he just panicked.

397
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:18,965
He made a mistake
due to his lack of experience.

398
00:29:20,133 --> 00:29:21,926
I'm sure he'll improve with time.

399
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,846
We can't wait indefinitely
until he improves.

400
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,140
The company isn't a school!

401
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,143
Mr. Nam...

402
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,645
will be reassigned.

403
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,440
-Grandpa!
-Mr. Chairman.

404
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,734
No. You can't do that.

405
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:39,235
Do as I say.

406
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,281
Shin. You just focus
on your wedding planning.

407
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:48,620
What did you just say?

408
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,205
Wedding?

409
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,832
With whom?

410
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,252
Who is his fiancée?

411
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,507
Obviously, he'll have to marry you, Ye-na.

412
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,345
Marriage?

413
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:07,388
With this thing?

414
00:30:15,021 --> 00:30:16,231
PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT

415
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:17,148
What...

416
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,442
is this?

417
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,652
As it says.

418
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,612
It's a prenuptial agreement.

419
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,865
We don't need any wedding gifts.

420
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,785
If you agree to these terms,

421
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:30,787
we'll proceed with the wedding right away.

422
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,039
There's no need to read it.

423
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,499
I'll sign it now.

424
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:39,420
It's proper etiquette
to take these matters seriously.

425
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,884
Sure.

426
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,638
Your father is absolutely right.

427
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,016
But Ye-na,

428
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,143
if it isn't you...

429
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,981
but your father who refuses to accept it,

430
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,650
I may be very disappointed.

431
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,112
It'll make me wonder...

432
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,865
if he is after something else.

433
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,700
There's no way.

434
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,244
We'll take a quick read through it now.

435
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,433
What medicine is this?

436
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:35,768
-Is someone sick?
-Yes.

437
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:37,562
It's mine.

438
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,356
It's an anti-anxiety medicine.

439
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,194
Aren't you leaving?

440
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,958
Dad.

441
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,756
How could you forget
your dementia medicine?

442
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,684
What do we do now?

443
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,937
Things got worse.

444
00:32:19,354 --> 00:32:22,106
-He'll be caught if he gets married.
-Thank you for your concern, but...

445
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,608
It's not about Mr. Nam.

446
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,401
I'm worried about myself. Me.

447
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,865
If he gets caught,
it won't end with just him.

448
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,951
I'll be in trouble too for my involvement.

449
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:35,078
Isn't this super serious?

450
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,704
I'll gauge the situation,

451
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,289
so take Mr. Nam home.

452
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,791
Just us two?

453
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,668
Is that a problem?

454
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,463
I still feel awkward.

455
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,717
No. It's okay. I can do it.

456
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,118
How did the meeting go today?

457
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,078
It was bad for Shin, wasn't it?

458
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,205
They are reassigning him.

459
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,791
Also...

460
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:24,836
Let's talk later. This way.

461
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,842
The reassignment was a smokescreen.

462
00:33:30,925 --> 00:33:32,260
He was after the marriage.

463
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,095
That snake.

464
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:38,349
Sign the grossly unfair
agreement, and marry her off.

465
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:40,435
This is a total threat!

466
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:43,855
He wants you to become
powerless and just support Shin.

467
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:47,150
You must stop this marriage at all costs.

468
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,819
How can we stop Ye-na
if she wants to marry him?

469
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,363
She won't listen to Mr. Suh.

470
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:14,302
I look just like
the human Nam Shin, right?

471
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:15,845
I'm not scary, right?

472
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:26,606
We've arrived, Mr. Nam.

473
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:49,712
Why aren't you going in?

474
00:34:49,796 --> 00:34:51,422
You should go in with me.

475
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,216
We are on the same side
and share a secret.

476
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,362
Why do you keep doing this, Mr. Nam?

477
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,572
You have a steel rod
in your left leg, right?

478
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,700
How did you know...

479
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,167
What is that?

480
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:29,293
IoT.

481
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:31,963
I've connected
what I searched online to the TV.

482
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:37,176
Kang So-bong and Han Suh-hee.

483
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,512
She slammed Kang So-bong to the ground.

484
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,597
Han Suh-hee is attacking her leg.

485
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,864
Why are you digging into my life?

486
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,324
This is a crime.

487
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:02,910
-You're a robot too.
-What?

488
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,371
You have a steel rod, so you're a cyborg.

489
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,789
Thus, you are a robot.

490
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:07,915
Cyborg...

491
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:11,460
Don't compare me to you!

492
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,512
I'm going crazy in case we get caught,

493
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,514
but you're so calm.

494
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:35,193
I can't do this.

495
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,474
Are you okay?

496
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,518
Are you monitoring me?

497
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,479
Get away.

498
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,232
Get off of me.

499
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,816
What's going on?

500
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,614
I'm sorry, sir.

501
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:23,115
I was overly sensitive...

502
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,784
when you were joking around.

503
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,499
You can't even take a joke?

504
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:35,836
I'm sorry.

505
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,296
You must have been surprised.

506
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,843
Let's go upstairs.
I need to talk to you.

507
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:46,639
No. I'm going to stay with So-bong.

508
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,307
What?

509
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,227
Stop joking.

510
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:54,397
I can't say this in front
of an employee. Let's go.

511
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,282
I like the scent of your room.

512
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,410
Should I move in here?

513
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,872
When we get married,

514
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:14,250
let's not move out.
Let's live here with Grandpa.

515
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,626
I can't marry you.

516
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,295
I'm going to marry you.

517
00:38:18,212 --> 00:38:20,256
I promised that when we got engaged.

518
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,008
I just want your body next to me...

519
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,968
even if your heart isn't there.

520
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,389
Why are you staring at the door?
Listen to me.

521
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:47,033
Gosh. What happened there?

522
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,493
Darn it.

523
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,872
You saw for sure, right?

524
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,123
Yes.

525
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,751
Why won't this brat pick up?

526
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,753
She always makes me go to her.

527
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,602
-What?
-Where are you?

528
00:39:14,977 --> 00:39:16,729
Did you eat your phone or something?

529
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:18,647
Why weren't you picking up?

530
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,609
I'm on my way to find you now.

531
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,027
You're not in his house?

532
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,613
-What house?
-Nam Shin's house!

533
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:29,241
Tell me the truth.
Are you really working there?

534
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,911
I'm out right now.

535
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:34,914
I'm almost at your gym.
Just make me some noodles.

536
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,957
Make them as spicy and salty as possible.

537
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,210
The gym? Why?

538
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,427
You got fired again, didn't you?

539
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,553
I did not.

540
00:39:49,678 --> 00:39:52,515
They begged me to stay, but I left them.

541
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,184
It's a long story. Let's talk in person.

542
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:57,812
Stop bluffing, you brat.

543
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:01,482
No wonder you weren't with Mr. Nam.

544
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:04,568
Mr. Nam? What do you mean?

545
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,613
They saw Mr. Nam
near here just minutes ago.

546
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,409
-Right, In-tae?
-Yes, sir.

547
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:14,078
So stop lying. Where are you?

548
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,414
If I catch you, I'll break your legs!

549
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,341
Why should I?

550
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:44,650
You can't go.

551
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,363
You can't go.

552
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,449
Mr. Nam.

553
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,246
Well, I won't talk about you.

554
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:59,290
I won't even take Mr. Suh's calls either.

555
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:03,252
I don't want to be involved
in this nonsense, so move.

556
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,921
Please help me.

557
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:09,341
Stop acting like a person in front of me!

558
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:13,179
I saw what was inside of there.

559
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,182
Freeze.

560
00:41:16,765 --> 00:41:18,350
Don't you dare follow me again.

561
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:13,989
My husband and son both worked there,

562
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:17,243
but it feels foreign and new to me.

563
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,248
Why did you come?

564
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,668
-If he can do it, you should...
-Shin...

565
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:27,670
Not him.

566
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,715
You'll be going into PK's building.

567
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,511
If he does it,
you won't need to take this risk.

568
00:42:36,345 --> 00:42:37,763
Why can't he do it?

569
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,237
You psycho!

570
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,989
Do you have a death wish?

571
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:57,199
Let us go home!

572
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:16,260
Aren't you scared? What if you die?

573
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,596
I am not scared, and I don't die.

574
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:20,681
Why do I even bother?

575
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,767
Are you really standing here
because of me?

576
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,686
You told me to freeze.

577
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:27,896
What if you get in an accident?

578
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,232
What if you break like
last time and people see?

579
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,318
That's why I need your help.

580
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:35,237
Why do you keep asking me for help?

581
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:38,073
-I won't tell Mr. Suh.
-It isn't just Mr. Suh.

582
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,451
I can't shock people.

583
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:44,288
You were shocked
and scared because of me too.

584
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:46,498
You were disgusted by me, right?

585
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:58,260
I'm sorry to bother you.

586
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:03,515
No. It's nothing for you to be sorry for.

587
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,893
You know me well.

588
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:09,021
That's why you can help me well.

589
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:12,524
Help me prevent others
from being shocked like you.

590
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,902
So that I won't make mistakes...

591
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,488
or get caught.

592
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,463
What are you doing?

593
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,714
Hold on.

594
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:53,482
Don't lose it again.

595
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:55,818
Your mom would be sad.

596
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,413
Am I asking for too much?

597
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,756
Hi, Dad.

598
00:45:19,049 --> 00:45:20,509
I'm not coming home today.

599
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:23,011
I'm going back into that house. Bye.

600
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,935
Aren't you going to take it?

601
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,520
You don't want to go with me?

602
00:45:35,023 --> 00:45:36,525
You'll go with me and help me?

603
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:40,404
You helped me too.

604
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,322
I'm just repaying the debt.

605
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:46,160
If things get complicated, I'm out.

606
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,497
"A human's judgment is
always complicated."

607
00:45:50,789 --> 00:45:52,666
I know that too. Let's go.

608
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:56,420
The signal. It's a red light.

609
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:02,426
No way.

610
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:04,762
You can control the traffic lights?

611
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:05,763
I did well, right?

612
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:08,891
Let's go.

613
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,727
How did you find me?

614
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,145
Your phone GPS.

615
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,775
I can find you wherever you are.

616
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,237
There's a kill switch.

617
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,911
Are you saying that's inside of his body?

618
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:32,080
Yes. He doesn't know it yet.

619
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:37,127
A kill switch is like death for humans.

620
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,338
Why did you build...

621
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,298
Because if the real Shin wakes up,

622
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:43,884
the fake Shin needs to disappear.

623
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:46,929
I installed it before sending him here.

624
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,264
Only I can access it.

625
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:55,354
So that's why you kept him
from the self-driving car.

626
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,856
Yes. In case he works on it...

627
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,360
and realizes something similar...

628
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:04,238
to the car's kill switch is within him.

629
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:10,285
It will be shocking
for him if he finds out.

630
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,082
That will not happen.

631
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,335
He is a robot after all.

632
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,006
It's time. Let's go.

633
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:50,576
The anti-hacking system is
top-of-the-line.

634
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,620
Someone intentionally planted malware

635
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:55,330
to permit someone to hack it.

636
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,749
I'll manipulate the kill switch now,

637
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,753
so that it can be activated
remotely if authorized.

638
00:48:02,963 --> 00:48:04,715
I'm almost done. Give me a minute.

639
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:34,036
Right. What was it that
you wanted to tell me earlier?

640
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,122
Is there another punishment
on top of reassignment?

641
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,876
Yes. It's about Ye-na. Mr. Suh's daughter.

642
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,461
What about his daughter?

643
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,379
Look who's here.

644
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:01,229
He said he'd be back soon.
What's taking so long?

645
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:13,116
No, I'll do it.

646
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,202
-Give it to me.
-No.

647
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,628
I can take it.

648
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,341
You haven't changed at all.

649
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,718
I was curious now and then...

650
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,762
since I didn't hear from you.

651
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,973
You're still latching onto the company.

652
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:39,726
How does it feel to be
a dog for three generations?

653
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:44,564
You've gotten tougher through the years.

654
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:48,068
You used to cry a lot when we first met.

655
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:50,028
You made me this way.

656
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,322
You tore Shin and me apart.

657
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,242
You've been reunited
at least now. How great is that?

658
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,870
I'll keep it a secret from the chairman,

659
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,123
so meet with him all you'd like.

660
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,166
There's no need for secrecy.

661
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,670
You people don't scare me at all anymore.

662
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:11,008
Tell him that I'll go see him soon.

663
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,468
Once we become in-laws,

664
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,054
we'll see each other more often.

665
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,182
In-laws?

666
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,560
What do you mean?

667
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,688
Didn't you know?

668
00:50:25,439 --> 00:50:27,733
The chairman ordered the marriage...

669
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,526
of my daughter with Shin.

670
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:30,819
What?

671
00:50:30,902 --> 00:50:32,529
You despise me so much.

672
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:36,033
Can you accept me as your in-law?

673
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:06,146
Hello?

674
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,318
No, not yet.

675
00:51:12,569 --> 00:51:14,196
I couldn't find anything yet.

676
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,381
Nam Shin...

677
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,675
was definitely here.

678
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,179
I'll look more into it and contact you.

679
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:56,113
But... why did you come back?

680
00:51:58,115 --> 00:52:00,450
I just spoke with our guy
in the Czech Republic,

681
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,036
and he says he's sure
that Mr. Nam was there.

682
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:05,664
What does it matter where Shin was?

683
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:08,458
Even his mom is into the office.

684
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,210
Dr. Oh?

685
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:15,257
I need to manipulate her somehow...

686
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,259
to stop this marriage.

687
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,729
I removed the camera,
so you can put it back.

688
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,943
-Want to come in?
-Me?

689
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,611
No.

690
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,365
I'm just curious...

691
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,117
but can you eat?

692
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,952
I don't need to eat, but I can.

693
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,787
What about your battery?

694
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:51,710
So that's why you had
so many of these in your closet.

695
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,254
You really are a machine.

696
00:52:55,046 --> 00:52:56,882
You seem so real.

697
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,054
You don't even blink.

698
00:53:11,605 --> 00:53:13,106
It must really not hurt.

699
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:18,278
Even now?

700
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:19,696
Not at all.

701
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:22,490
Gosh, you're no fun.

702
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,243
Then what was that before...

703
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,704
when you held my hand
and said stuff about lies?

704
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:30,707
It's a lie detector of sorts.

705
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:33,084
I wink if the person is lying.

706
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:34,502
You wink?

707
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:37,797
Ask me anything.

708
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:42,928
-Did you watch me take off my clothes?
-No.

709
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:44,429
Lie.

710
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:48,433
That's not fun.

711
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:50,852
-I have x-ray vision too.
-What?

712
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,568
What are you doing?

713
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,569
Just kidding.

714
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,072
I saw that in the movie, "Superman".

715
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,575
I'm the human, so I should be patient.

716
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:07,619
How much?

717
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:11,414
-Sorry?
-How much do you cost?

718
00:54:11,957 --> 00:54:12,999
10 million won?

719
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:15,794
10 billion won?

720
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,922
Mom didn't make me as a product to sell.

721
00:54:20,048 --> 00:54:22,217
I can't get used to you calling her "Mom."

722
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:26,096
I'll go now. See you tomorrow.

723
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:35,855
But she is my mom.

724
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,776
My mom made me.

725
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,572
How could you do this?

726
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:48,493
Why didn't you tell me
Shin was engaged to his daughter?

727
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,162
I didn't expect it to be
suddenly rushed like this.

728
00:54:53,039 --> 00:54:54,374
Okay.

729
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,585
Mr. Ji. You didn't see Shin today, right?

730
00:54:57,669 --> 00:54:59,713
You should see him before you go.

731
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:03,717
He can never marry her.

732
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,552
I'll stop it at all costs.

733
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:06,636
Of course.

734
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:09,139
If we don't, he'll get caught.

735
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,140
This is so boring.

736
00:55:52,891 --> 00:55:54,601
You again? You're not even a girl.

737
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,730
Yes. At least hang out with a girl.

738
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:00,982
You're not even drinking...

739
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,484
or dating.

740
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,903
-Why won't you go home?
-Because I'm annoyed.

741
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,697
I keep running away,
but you keep finding me.

742
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:10,033
Then hide better
so that I never find you.

743
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:12,660
I will soon.

744
00:56:13,078 --> 00:56:14,996
It isn't your fault, so don't get hurt.

745
00:56:21,294 --> 00:56:22,712
Is this what you meant?

746
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:28,301
You're right in front of me,

747
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:31,012
but I can't find you.

748
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:35,558
Shin.

749
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,436
It's too hard for me.

750
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,272
Stop worrying me,

751
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:43,733
and wake up.

752
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,994
SUH YE-NA

753
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,373
Hello?

754
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,917
Sorry for calling out of the blue.

755
00:57:01,209 --> 00:57:03,545
I need to talk to you about Shin.

756
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,255
Do you have time to meet now?

757
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:08,675
Sure.

758
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:10,468
Where should I go?

759
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,593
There's a kill switch.

760
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,345
He doesn't know it yet.

761
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,308
Mr. Ji?

762
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,149
Why are you here?

763
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:09,903
Ms. Suh called Mr. Nam
and said she wanted to meet him.

764
00:58:10,945 --> 00:58:12,447
I'm sure it's about the wedding.

765
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:14,741
Let's go and refuse it.

766
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,796
Wait out here for now.

767
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,471
Come in.

768
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:53,363
What are you waiting for? Sit here.

769
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,406
Mr. Ji, you should sit too.

770
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:09,212
Let's eat since everyone is here.

771
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,673
-Please bring the rest in.
-Yes, ma'am.

772
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:15,969
Why did you...

773
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:18,179
suddenly gather us here?

774
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:19,639
You rude brat.

775
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,933
Must we gather if you say so?

776
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:24,394
You know Shin is passive.

777
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:27,730
Shin, that's okay
since I'm active and aggressive.

778
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,408
I'll accept all the terms you requested.

779
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:42,829
Shin and I will get married.

780
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:44,998
Ye-na.

781
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:52,297
Let's step outside and talk first.

782
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:55,383
No. I'm going to stop
being your daughter...

783
00:59:55,466 --> 00:59:57,010
and be Shin's wife.

784
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:58,636
Don't try to stop me.

785
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:01,180
You're obsessed with Shin, aren't you?

786
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,100
Dad, what will we do with her?

787
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:07,061
What else?

788
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,814
Ms. Suh made a big decision.

789
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,899
Naturally, we'll accept her.

790
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:13,735
-Mr. Chairman.
-Mr. Chairman.

791
01:00:13,818 --> 01:00:15,987
Enough. No more attitudes.

792
01:00:17,238 --> 01:00:18,364
Shin.

793
01:00:19,324 --> 01:00:21,117
Marry Ye-na right away.

794
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,961
Shin, I'll be good. I promise.

795
01:00:43,056 --> 01:00:45,308
A sign to refuse no matter what.

796
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,686
Search database on
how to reject someone.

797
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,981
How about asking
a guy friend to act like...

798
01:00:52,065 --> 01:00:53,733
-he is your boyfriend?
-I think...

799
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,943
-you should refuse flat out.
-How frustrating.

800
01:00:56,027 --> 01:00:58,404
Just bring someone else.

801
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:06,120
That woman.

802
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,208
The woman who knows my identity.

803
01:01:12,251 --> 01:01:13,920
You'll go with me and help me?

804
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,172
You helped me too.

805
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:17,840
I'm just repaying the debt.

806
01:01:17,924 --> 01:01:19,926
A woman who knows
but is willing to help me.

807
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:21,219
Kang So-bong.

808
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:26,200
You're mad at me.

809
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:31,581
Hey, Tin Can.

810
01:02:31,664 --> 01:02:33,499
You're my robot slave from now on.

811
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:36,377
Fine. I am your robot slave from now on.

812
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:38,796
Your pulse is racing. You are excited.

813
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:41,591
-Get on my back.
-I must've lost my mind.

814
01:02:42,133 --> 01:02:44,761
Don't hold my hand
whenever you want and so carelessly!

815
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:46,721
By any chance, do you like me now?

816
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,184
