1
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,042
Six a.m.
Time for her morning exercise.

2
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:48,631
The lazy woman who never wakes up on time.

3
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,093
So-bong. It's time to exercise.

4
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,762
If you don't get up, I'm coming in.

5
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,306
So-bong.

6
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:01,978
That's right.

7
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,148
So-bong isn't here anymore.

8
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,485
Mr. Nam. I'm going to quit...

9
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:12,363
from working as your bodyguard
from now on.

10
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,282
Thank you for everything.

11
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:25,877
The minor error
that repeats every morning.

12
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,011
Let's stop running. I'm tired today.

13
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:39,891
I'm human, so I'll die.

14
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,352
Don't you know excessive
exercise can kill a person?

15
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,480
6:45 am.

16
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,731
Hologram error.

17
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,409
Please get in, sir.

18
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,751
8:12 am.

19
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:08,670
Error successfully fixed.

20
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:10,004
Mr. Nam?

21
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:12,298
Please get in.

22
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,933
That day, So-bong said...

23
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:23,434
Stop it.

24
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:25,854
I want nothing more to do with you.

25
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,078
So-bong...

26
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:44,664
is no longer here.

27
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,301
What are you looking for?

28
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,472
What did you lose?

29
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,976
You have a package.
It's from him, right?

30
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,648
Why did you quit?
What did you do so wrong

31
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,359
that made you unable
to even pack your things?

32
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,529
Please send me my things.

33
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:21,117
Mr. Suh suspects me.
I can't do it anymore.

34
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,705
He says he won't forgive me
if I don't find Dr. Oh.

35
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,332
I'm really scared.

36
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,752
I'll quit now.

37
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,463
I'm a bit flustered.

38
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,799
You're the only person
who can watch Mr. Nam for me.

39
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,302
You can control him better than--

40
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,429
It's not about controlling him.

41
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,264
You heard what happened yesterday.

42
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:46,935
What if Mr. Nam breaks
protocol again to protect me?

43
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,312
What if he gets caught?

44
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,522
We'll make sure that doesn't happen.

45
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:55,026
We'll see why the rules
surrounding you were set first.

46
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:57,111
I just don't want to do it.

47
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,740
What do you hate so much?

48
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,703
I know I may sound like a looney,

49
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,539
but Mr. Nam...

50
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:14,212
At first, I thought of him
as a machine or object.

51
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:17,215
But after spending time with him,

52
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,468
I found he speaks and acts like a person.

53
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,680
At times, it's like he's thinking too.

54
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,475
I feel sorry for him
when Ms. Suh attacks him.

55
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,397
I know I'm being ridiculous.

56
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:34,649
I hate getting emotionally involved.

57
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,567
He's just a robot.

58
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:43,032
I knew you'd look at me that way.

59
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,160
It's just me, isn't it?

60
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,246
You've never felt that way, right?

61
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,960
You know it's a ridiculous emotion,

62
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,336
so you should control it.

63
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,047
You're just as rational as expected.

64
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,303
I don't want to be involved anymore.

65
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,139
I hate complicated and unclear emotions.

66
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,518
Why are you hitting me?

67
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,353
You should unpack your box,

68
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,022
not stare off into space.

69
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,316
Did you leave your heart
there or something?

70
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,525
Dad.

71
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:22,363
So-bong is very professional.

72
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:25,450
You should go to your own home too.

73
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,702
How could you leech off us?

74
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,287
Give me just a few days.

75
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:32,749
The crazed fans are camped
outside my door.

76
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,545
The match is coming up.
Aren't you going to train?

77
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:39,130
We will.

78
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,060
You'll be sitting there soon.

79
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,646
I should sit there and help
all that I can.

80
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,607
So-bong quit.

81
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,360
Do you know why she quit?

82
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,362
She said she didn't want to work anymore.

83
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:05,823
Whatever the reason,
I think it's for the best.

84
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,576
You had gotten weird
briefly because of her.

85
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,829
She quit before she affected you worse,

86
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,873
so we should be grateful
and forget about her.

87
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,632
Is the hotel comfortable?

88
00:06:23,466 --> 00:06:26,094
Please be patient until
Mr. Suh quiets down.

89
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,303
I will.

90
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,806
Let's get to the meeting.

91
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:32,183
Just go in, and give
the presentation you prepared.

92
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,643
Mr. Suh may be on the offensive,

93
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,770
so don't be nervous,
and take it in stride.

94
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:39,732
My son, Shin, is with me.
I'm not worried.

95
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,532
I'm the new team manager
of the self-driving car team.

96
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,033
I'm Oh Laura.

97
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:51,285
It's nice to meet you.

98
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,212
I feel confident since you've joined us.

99
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:03,089
I had the team sit in...

100
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,716
since you're giving a presentation.

101
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,927
Let's begin.

102
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:14,517
A competitor recently
developed a QRNG chip...

103
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,894
which generates random numbers.

104
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:19,772
I'd like our self-driving car
team to develop...

105
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,651
this chip to completely
prevent hacking as well.

106
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:27,155
Develop it ourselves? When we have
a contract with the competitor?

107
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,322
I like it.

108
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,032
I know I can do it.

109
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,493
A research team performs research,

110
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,996
not purchase a product from competitors.

111
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:38,833
A hacking prevention chip is
a core technology.

112
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,668
Not only for self-driving cars,

113
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,212
but in artificial intelligence
products overall.

114
00:07:43,713 --> 00:07:45,298
Luckily, a foreign lab...

115
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,675
manufactured a similar chip.

116
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:50,553
I know we can create it soon.

117
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,392
We can just sign an exclusive contract
with the company who developed it already.

118
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,853
Why are you making it more complicated?

119
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,858
I'm putting everything
I have on the line for this MOU.

120
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:08,613
I'm negotiating to bring the price down
by five percent.

121
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,574
The self-driving car team
can just worry...

122
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:14,452
about how to use that chip in the M Car.

123
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:18,372
In six months,
we can develop a smaller, cheaper chip.

124
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,958
We can possess the technology ourselves.

125
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:24,086
Why must we buy
someone else's technology?

126
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:26,005
We can't wait a single day,

127
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,465
let alone six months.

128
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,717
Will the market wait for us?

129
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,220
We can take the easy way.

130
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,764
Why should we waste our money?

131
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,016
Can we not develop it
because we have no money?

132
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,476
How much money...

133
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,728
does the company have?

134
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,913
Mr. Nam.

135
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:01,791
The point isn't the price of the chip.

136
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,545
If the negative impression by the
failed test drive persists for six months,

137
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:08,047
the M Car may become unrecoverable.

138
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:11,008
We need that chip immediately

139
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,927
to show the M Car is still on track.

140
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,637
Mr. Suh.

141
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,181
Bring the price down by 10 percent.

142
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,769
Yes, Mr. Nam. I will.

143
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,438
Please finalize the MOU
once the price is agreed upon.

144
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,815
Yes, sir.

145
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,234
We'll use the profits from the M Car

146
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:31,153
to develop the smaller,
cheaper chip you mentioned.

147
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,033
I think we have a decision.

148
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,761
Not bad, kid.

149
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,847
You know how to embrace your enemy.

150
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,605
I'm a bit confused.

151
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,611
You used to always be emotional,

152
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,654
but you suddenly
entrusted me with a job.

153
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:17,325
Why did you change so suddenly?

154
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,329
Why?

155
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,205
Do you fear my change?

156
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:24,790
Pardon?

157
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,252
I'm kidding.

158
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:32,048
Human beings change. Why can't I?

159
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:35,926
Mr. Nam.

160
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,013
Let's go.

161
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:55,988
What is he up to?

162
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,538
Why did you do that?

163
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,792
Why did you ignore
my opinion and take Mr. Suh's side?

164
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:10,378
I don't ignore anyone or take sides.

165
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,880
Based on the big data
analysis of the M Car,

166
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:16,425
restoring the consumers' image
was the priority.

167
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,052
It was a business decision.

168
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,804
You should leave that decision to me.

169
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,139
Are you saying you'll help Mr. Suh...

170
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,141
if he's correct again in the future?

171
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,726
Is that wrong?

172
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,353
What?

173
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,315
You have a meeting
with Ye-na, so go ahead.

174
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,990
Why aren't you doing anything?

175
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,743
He's ruining our plan.

176
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,578
Not necessarily.

177
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:45,913
What do you mean?

178
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:49,083
The chairman was very
pleased with the meeting.

179
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,627
The more he gains the chairman's trust,

180
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,421
the better it is for Shin.

181
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,632
Shin will get credit
for what he did today.

182
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,519
Where is it?

183
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,896
Did I really lose it?

184
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,628
So-bong.

185
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:36,213
Stop it.

186
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,340
I want nothing more to do with you.

187
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:47,433
That's right!

188
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:49,727
One, two, left hook to the body!

189
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,103
Good!

190
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,855
Focus, please.

191
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,277
Hey. Why are you carrying that again?

192
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,196
You'll kill me if I bum around.

193
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,822
I have to earn some money.

194
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:04,992
So-bong! I'll take care
of the female members.

195
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,619
You stay out of it.

196
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,413
The older ladies love my big size.

197
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,998
You punk.

198
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:12,208
Sweetie!

199
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,585
Sweetie!

200
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,797
Did you hear?

201
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,841
I went to the convenience
store and almost fainted.

202
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,094
Nam Shin is getting married next week.

203
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,764
-What? Married?
-What? Married?

204
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,061
I'm going out.

205
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,272
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

206
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,817
You got your wish.

207
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,820
You finally got him after
having a crush for 20 years.

208
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,113
He finally grew up.

209
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,074
He apologized for not being nice to me.

210
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,368
He said he'll be good to me for life...

211
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,911
since we're starting late.

212
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,163
Isn't that right?

213
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,125
Put your arm on my shoulder
so we seem close.

214
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,087
Now.

215
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:05,678
They look so happy together.

216
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:09,056
You kept whining
that he wouldn't kiss you.

217
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,641
What a turn of events.

218
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:16,480
Shin. Here.

219
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,193
Do it now, if you want to finish this.

220
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:26,448
Are you really Shin?

221
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,576
You're doing everything she says.

222
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,828
What happened to your bodyguard?

223
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,746
The girl you hit at the airport.

224
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,039
I heard you brought her home.

225
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,668
She looked pretty from what I recall.

226
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:39,628
Is she pretty in real life?

227
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,422
So-bong?

228
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:43,883
She's such a tramp.

229
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,467
She'll do anything for money.

230
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,761
Then should I try hitting on her?

231
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,682
I can hire her to be my bodyguard
and play with her.

232
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,518
Shin.

233
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:56,770
Give me her number.

234
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,900
Hey. Give me her number.

235
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,192
Hey.

236
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,698
Ouch. That hurts.
What's your problem?

237
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,909
How dare you order me around?

238
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,286
You find out yourself, you jerk.

239
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,789
Hey. I'll give you her number.

240
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:17,625
You can play with her if you want.

241
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,097
-What is this?
-I'm scared.

242
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,307
What happened?

243
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,934
What just happened?

244
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,024
Mr. Nam.

245
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,780
I think we should leave.

246
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,171
What's wrong with you?

247
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,049
Do you want them to know you're a robot?

248
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,259
I told you to stop.
Why do you keep crossing the line?

249
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,178
What do you want me to do?

250
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,472
They said bad things about So-bong.

251
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,766
What's it to you if they
say or do such things?

252
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,727
She quit. She isn't here.

253
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,562
But I keep seeing her.

254
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,649
What do you mean?

255
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,443
There are constant errors
that cause me to see her.

256
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,904
I do not know the cause yet.

257
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,249
For now, please focus
on pretending to be Shin.

258
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:42,918
Shin wasn't close to So-bong,

259
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,878
so don't be sensitive about her.

260
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,923
I'm different from the human Nam Shin,

261
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,801
and I'm much closer to So-bong.

262
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:55,514
So-bong said...

263
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,017
that I'm just me.

264
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:03,105
No matter how hard I try,
I can't be the human Nam Shin.

265
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:08,027
If I act like myself,
you and Mom get angry.

266
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,237
But not So-bong.

267
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,615
She's the only person
who accepts me for who I am.

268
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,201
Is that why I keep seeing her?

269
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,664
Go home first.

270
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,500
I need to stop by somewhere.

271
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,458
Mommy!

272
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,710
Shin! Let go!

273
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,754
Shin!

274
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,381
Daddy died because of you.

275
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:13,842
I won't go with you, so don't come back.

276
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:16,512
If you do, I will just die too.

277
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,263
He was much worse.

278
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:21,809
He was intentionally mean
to keep everyone at bay.

279
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,436
Shin must not smile much.

280
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,064
I made Shin smile...

281
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,566
because I wished Shin would smile.

282
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,403
I knew nothing about you.

283
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,366
I shouldn't have left you here.

284
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,038
I'm sorry, Shin.

285
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,649
Errors?

286
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,361
Yes. I think So-bong is the cause.

287
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:17,156
When I checked his system,

288
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,408
I saw no changes in his nervous network.

289
00:19:20,784 --> 00:19:22,744
Where did the errors...

290
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,415
I have no choice.

291
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:31,044
I'll have to go into the system
even if it is risky.

292
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,756
What if a bigger problem arises?

293
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,843
I'll meet with So-bong first.

294
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,636
He'll listen to her.

295
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:41,972
I'll meet with her.

296
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,057
It'll be better if his mom asks.

297
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,561
If she refuses,

298
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,022
we'll fix the system right away.

299
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,192
Okay.

300
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,060
So-bong isn't coming anymore.

301
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:38,195
When should I return this?

302
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:42,032
She said she wanted
nothing to do with me.

303
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,122
Come to the hospital.

304
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,708
I'll schedule it,

305
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,418
so come get checked out.

306
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:55,754
Has he...

307
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,048
made any progress?

308
00:20:58,632 --> 00:20:59,633
Hey.

309
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:03,053
You look worse than him right now.

310
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,390
Listen to me before your body
gets mad at you.

311
00:21:07,307 --> 00:21:09,309
I'm doing this ridiculous
thing only because of you.

312
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,978
I got it.

313
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,605
Don't you threaten me too.

314
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,024
So why did you even start this...

315
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,069
See you.

316
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,619
I know.

317
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,789
Why did I start this?

318
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,797
Whenever I saw that robot,

319
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,758
I thought of you.

320
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,430
But today, seeing you makes me...

321
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,348
think of him.

322
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,853
You were always pestered...

323
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,771
by the chairman and Mr. Suh.

324
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:57,941
But that robot...

325
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,069
is pestered by your mom and me.

326
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,282
You and he are both pestered...

327
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:07,200
by humans.

328
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,829
That must be why I pitied him.

329
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,542
Even if he's just a robot.

330
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,846
Shin.

331
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:30,057
Wake up quickly...

332
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,102
before my feelings get more complicated.

333
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,559
I'm sure this was a pain,

334
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,977
but you did it well.

335
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,608
Aren't you being careful
because of Mr. Suh?

336
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,194
Let's just go for now.

337
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,248
Don't lose that cab.

338
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,332
Okay.

339
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,108
What did you say to Shin?

340
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,153
What did you do...

341
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,489
to make him violent and see you
when you aren't even there?

342
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,745
I told him not to listen to anyone else...

343
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,248
and do what he thinks
is the right thing to do.

344
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:20,876
I didn't know that happened.

345
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,754
You're more thoughtless than I expected.

346
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:27,674
You know what situation we're in.

347
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,092
How could you say that?

348
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,261
Return the old Nam Shin.

349
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,181
Otherwise, I'll have to use
another method.

350
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:37,601
Another method?

351
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:40,896
You don't need to know that much.

352
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,566
You know my son, who's lying in bed,

353
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,319
will be in danger
if something goes wrong with him.

354
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,738
Consider it as helping them both,

355
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,114
and meet with him.

356
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,036
Don't worry too much.

357
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:57,787
We have a last resort.

358
00:24:58,205 --> 00:24:59,789
Do you mean the kill switch?

359
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,458
If we turn that on,

360
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,252
will he really be destroyed?

361
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,672
How is that for them both?

362
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,800
You care only about
the one lying in the bed.

363
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:12,969
You say he's your son,

364
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:14,763
but you're sacrificing
him for your real son.

365
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:16,556
Didn't you call me here...

366
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,433
only because people may
find out he's a robot?

367
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,519
If you don't want to meet with him,
just say so.

368
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,021
The rest is none of your business.

369
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,397
Fine.

370
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:27,901
I don't want to be involved anymore,

371
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,653
so don't call me again.

372
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,783
Call me if you change your mind.

373
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,702
I'll wait until tomorrow morning.

374
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,423
Follow it.

375
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,849
They stop and go.

376
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,060
Where are they going?

377
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:06,815
What? This is near
the hotel where they started.

378
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,836
Hold on.

379
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,843
Keep following that cab.

380
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,607
Call me if you change your mind.

381
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,358
I'll wait until morning.

382
00:26:56,489 --> 00:27:00,368
NAM SHIN

383
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,335
DELETE

384
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,669
DELETE CONTACT?
YES

385
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:23,516
What?

386
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,353
Dr. Oh met So-bong?

387
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,563
I showed her picture to the cab driver

388
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,024
and confirmed that it was her.

389
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:34,486
Kang So-bong was in the cab.

390
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,992
They did all that just to meet in secret?

391
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:44,496
I think Kang So-bong is deeply involved.

392
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,333
So she definitely is hiding something.

393
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:53,088
I need to get So-bong to talk.

394
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,549
Why are you being so cautious?

395
00:27:57,509 --> 00:28:00,762
You just have to take care of Nam Shin.

396
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,056
Then you should've done it
in the Czech Republic.

397
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,599
This is Korea.

398
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,602
There are too many eyes and ears.

399
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,939
Don't you remember what you did...

400
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,315
20 years ago?

401
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,151
You can do the same thing again.

402
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:16,736
Why are you so hesitant?

403
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,779
Shut your mouth.

404
00:28:19,322 --> 00:28:21,324
If you bring that up ever again,

405
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,368
I'll get rid of you first.

406
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,299
Now?

407
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,136
Okay, Mom.

408
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:43,972
I'll go with him.

409
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,936
Mom told me to come right now.

410
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:50,979
I'll go change.

411
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:01,614
I'll have to go into the system
even if it is risky.

412
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,534
If she refuses,

413
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,745
we'll fix the system right away.

414
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,914
A manual mode?

415
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:11,958
You didn't want him to be like an avatar,

416
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,210
so we removed it from the start. So why?

417
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,504
It isn't his fault if he does
something unpredictable.

418
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,090
It's our fault for not predicting it.

419
00:29:19,382 --> 00:29:21,301
Do you want to make him a toy robot now?

420
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,677
What else can we do?

421
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,889
Just wait for him to
return to being a good boy?

422
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,141
What if he's found out before then?

423
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,518
What if they find out that
the real Shin is hurt?

424
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,104
Mom.

425
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,109
A manual mode?

426
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:40,987
Is someone from outside controlling me?

427
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:42,614
That's a nice way to say it.

428
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:45,325
Your arms, legs, and even your face...

429
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,035
will be controlled by someone else.

430
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,539
We'll activate it only when necessary.

431
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:54,793
I won't let anyone else
control you but me.

432
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,545
Is it necessary?

433
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,297
Shin.

434
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,466
Go in with me.

435
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:11,267
Let's trust Dr. Oh.

436
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,354
I can't watch this.

437
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,819
If we don't need it anymore,
I'll remove it.

438
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,030
Come in.

439
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,287
So-bong.

440
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,415
-Slave, where are you?
-At the hideout.

441
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,793
Good. Come out right now.

442
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,680
Your savior came.

443
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:52,642
Here. You drive, Slave.

444
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,898
I'm not your slave anymore.

445
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,067
What? Look at your attitude.

446
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,447
Let me borrow him for a bit.

447
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,741
Don't bother me by calling.

448
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,745
Slave. Get in.

449
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,423
Again! Can't we just go?
No one's crossing.

450
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,468
It's more human
to break rules now and then.

451
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,387
I'm not human.

452
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:32,348
And safety comes first no matter what.

453
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:39,188
Why did you come?
You said you wanted to borrow me.

454
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:41,858
Return the old Nam Shin.

455
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,819
Otherwise, I'll have to
use another method.

456
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,239
Are you curious?

457
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,617
I need to tell you something,
so pull over.

458
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:52,160
I will not.

459
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,621
-What?
-I will act...

460
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,706
according to my judgment
and decisions today.

461
00:31:57,206 --> 00:31:59,083
That's what you told me to do.

462
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,961
Sure. Do whatever you want.

463
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,297
Where are we going?

464
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,524
I ran with you every morning.

465
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:27,111
You did? How?

466
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,198
There was an error,
so I saw you every day.

467
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:33,326
As I saw you run,
which you hated doing,

468
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,162
I decided to buy you
a bicycle if I saw you again.

469
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:39,749
That is why I bought
a less tiring electric bicycle.

470
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:45,588
Was doing whatever
you want buying me

471
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,256
an electric bike
and making me exercise?

472
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,883
I'm a rich corporate heir.

473
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,843
Let's ride just until the battery dies.

474
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:58,309
Okay. We can just talk afterward.

475
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:00,019
Let's go.

476
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:16,411
Hey. Don't go slowly just for me.

477
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,872
I didn't.

478
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,791
Are you have a confidence problem?

479
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:13,342
I'll bring it up.

480
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:17,346
It's okay. I can carry my own bike.

481
00:34:18,264 --> 00:34:20,516
I'm a robot, and you are a human.

482
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,769
You can't compare
when it comes to power.

483
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:28,566
You seem to forget
that humans created you.

484
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,737
Then we'll shoot for it. Loser carries it.

485
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,490
Okay. Let's play now.

486
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,493
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

487
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,372
This is a game of odds.
You can't beat me.

488
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,208
Out of three.

489
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,959
Rock, paper, scissors, shoot.

490
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,128
Yes. Odds? As if.

491
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,215
Humans are the one thing
you can't predict.

492
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,383
Again. Shoot.

493
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,260
I lost on purpose.

494
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:59,388
I know what you'll play next.
"Scissors", right?

495
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,558
It is not.

496
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,102
You thought "Rock" just now.

497
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,522
So annoying.

498
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,942
Forget it. I'll bring them up.

499
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:16,239
You acted tough enough.
I'll bring them up.

500
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,263
Thanks.

501
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,732
Hey! Wait for me!

502
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,780
Wait for me!

503
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,787
Slave! Where did you go?

504
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,517
It's so nice.

505
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,564
That's cold.

506
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:33,816
Isn't it refreshing?

507
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,287
Give me that.
You shouldn't play with your food.

508
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:53,294
You're lucky.
You don't sweat or get hot.

509
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,381
You're right. I don't sweat or get hot.

510
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:00,301
But I can't tell anyone.

511
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,931
Everyone tells me not to do anything...

512
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,682
and to hide myself.

513
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,978
But I can tell you everything.

514
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:15,316
Since you know the real me,
I can show you everything.

515
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:20,321
That's why I think I keep having
errors regarding you.

516
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,203
If I comfort you
when I'm not there, pay up.

517
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,413
You're a rich corporate heir.

518
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,957
You wouldn't take it anyway.

519
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,750
I can tell without holding your hand now.

520
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,086
You got me.

521
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,802
Even humans don't show their true selves.

522
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,888
Be strong, Slave.

523
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,238
What are you doing?

524
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,117
Now, tell me what you wanted to say.

525
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,244
You've been stalling.

526
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,123
-What?
-It's okay. Tell me.

527
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,708
I have no feelings.

528
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,086
I won't get hurt or angry,

529
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,796
so tell me anything.

530
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,387
So-bong?

531
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,229
This doesn't taste good.

532
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,190
I'm thirsty.

533
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,305
It's a green light.
I'm coming, So-bong.

534
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,431
Don't come.

535
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,355
I don't think I can say it to your face,

536
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:18,647
so stay there.

537
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,488
I know I told you to act
and decide things on your own,

538
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,573
but I take it back.

539
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,202
I wasn't even going to stay by your side.

540
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,746
It was irresponsible, cowardly,

541
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:35,623
and out of line.

542
00:39:40,628 --> 00:39:41,504
Slave.

543
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,093
Go back to being a slave.

544
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,137
Don't do as you wish.

545
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,932
Just do as Mr. Ji and Dr. Oh say.

546
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:56,685
That is what's best for you and me.

547
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:00,815
How is that the best?

548
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,442
You asked why I left, right?

549
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,654
Mr. Suh threatened me.

550
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,573
If you keep acting that way,

551
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,033
I'll be in danger, too.

552
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,161
I'm a selfish human being,

553
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,455
so I'm more important to myself.

554
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,962
I had fun today.

555
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,384
Let's never meet again.

556
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,433
Are you insane?

557
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,351
Don't you see the red light?

558
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,767
I'll return to being a slave again.

559
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,940
Goodbye for real,

560
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,359
So-bong.

561
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,282
Mom.

562
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:02,413
Please install the manual switch.

563
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,873
I'll do as you say.

564
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,218
Thank you.

565
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:38,073
CHAMPION GYM

566
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,875
I'll return to being a slave again.

567
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,420
Goodbye for real,

568
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:53,881
So-bong.

569
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:16,779
Sweetie, you're awake.

570
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,784
Something strange was delivered.

571
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:31,627
There's no sender's or recipient's name.

572
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:34,129
Did you guys steal it?

573
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:36,340
Not this time.

574
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,425
Do you really not know who sent this?

575
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:40,302
Of course, not.

576
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:47,184
This looks super expensive.

577
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,814
Maybe it's a gift from
the millionaire guy.

578
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:55,275
What? Like a farewell gift
since he's getting married?

579
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:59,196
What? Why do you look like that?

580
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,115
Were you crying?

581
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:04,410
What do you mean?
Why would she cry?

582
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:07,705
His marriage has nothing to do with her.

583
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,419
I can't beat up the guy I want,

584
00:45:13,502 --> 00:45:15,295
so you guy make the sacrifice.

585
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:16,547
What?

586
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:17,840
What is this?

587
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:20,467
There's nothing.

588
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,456
We officially become in-laws today.

589
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,792
For the kids' sake, please...

590
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,044
let me in a little closer.

591
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,504
Do you think...

592
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,923
a marriage would change our relationship?

593
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:03,802
What do you mean?

594
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:06,430
You still want to
get rid of Shin, don't you?

595
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:08,557
Just like you did to his dad.

596
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:11,393
You always want to take from others.

597
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,356
I'll watch carefully...

598
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,609
on what you do to Shin.

599
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,779
I'll expose everything you did...

600
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:25,949
to my husband and
to Shin behind my back.

601
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:27,910
I'm the one who survived,

602
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:29,578
not Jung-woo.

603
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:31,038
What?

604
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:33,540
Shin and I should be different.

605
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:34,708
Since...

606
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:37,377
my daughter is between us.

607
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,463
If you touch my son,

608
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:43,091
I don't care whether
she married my son or not.

609
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,052
I will make...

610
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,679
your daughter pay.

611
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:51,558
You'll be a strict mother-in-law.

612
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,738
Proceed as planned.

613
00:47:05,614 --> 00:47:06,740
You must...

614
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,660
make So-bong talk
by the end of the day.

615
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:10,786
Yes, sir.

616
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:13,747
I'll take care of it
before the wedding ends.

617
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,333
I made another as a spare.

618
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:00,586
Since we added the manual mode,

619
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:02,212
it was harder to make.

620
00:48:03,005 --> 00:48:05,507
I'll remote in and control him
whenever necessary,

621
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,968
so you don't have to worry anymore.

622
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,679
Go out, and greet the guests.

623
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:12,055
Be as friendly as possible.

624
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:26,528
After meeting with So-bong,

625
00:48:26,945 --> 00:48:28,530
he's been obedient like what you've seen.

626
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,033
I don't think we'll need the manual mode.

627
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:33,327
That's a relief.

628
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,145
Are you crying?

629
00:49:00,854 --> 00:49:02,272
This is shocking.

630
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,983
You can actually produce tears?

631
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:12,366
I don't like the idea of you
joining our family,

632
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:16,036
but you should say
a proper goodbye to your dad.

633
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,246
I'll let you be.

634
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,500
Aren't you guys leaving?

635
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:31,468
What are you doing?
Stop being so lame.

636
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,971
Okay. Sorry.

637
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:37,975
Dad.

638
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,437
Yes?

639
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,782
It's off-center.

640
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,077
Is it?

641
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,413
Sorry, Dad.

642
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:01,832
For what?

643
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:04,751
Just. For everything.

644
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:13,677
All done.

645
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,890
You should go.

646
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,853
Thanks, Ye-na.

647
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:48,295
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

648
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:06,938
This way.

649
00:51:13,695 --> 00:51:16,573
Someone would like to meet you.

650
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:17,699
Please come with me.

651
00:51:19,534 --> 00:51:20,911
-Sure.
-This way.

652
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:11,545
Sorry for texting so suddenly.

653
00:52:11,628 --> 00:52:13,880
Mr. Suh figured out the truth about Shin.

654
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:16,842
Please get rid of the file
in my desk at the office.

655
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,760
CALL

656
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:19,845
DR. OH

657
00:52:28,520 --> 00:52:30,480
I'm at the wedding, so I can't talk.

658
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,315
Please do this for Shin.

659
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,615
Okay. I'll go right now.

660
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:47,914
DELETE

661
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:49,332
NO MESSAGES

662
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:01,970
It'll start soon.
Go in, and get ready.

663
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,974
I'll be right there. Hello?

664
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:24,075
Okay. Please take your seats.

665
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,827
We'll begin soon.

666
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:49,851
Looking for this?

667
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,482
Sorry.

668
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:59,569
There's nothing in this.

669
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,782
This document...

670
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,493
is for you to fill out.

671
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,413
The truth about Mr. Nam.

672
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,750
"Mr. Suh...

673
00:54:15,377 --> 00:54:17,629
figured out the truth about Shin."

674
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:22,050
That's why you ran over here.

675
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:29,140
What is it? What do you know?

676
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:33,770
I don't know.

677
00:54:34,271 --> 00:54:35,855
Do I know something?

678
00:55:22,610 --> 00:55:24,195
Going down.

679
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,715
Let go!

680
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:01,358
Let me out! Let me out of here!

681
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:05,737
Let me out!
Please let me out of here!

682
00:56:24,714 --> 00:56:27,092
What's this? Darn it.

683
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,419
Darn it!

684
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:35,702
What is that?

685
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:12,780
That's...

686
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,016
Let go!

687
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,271
I'm not leaving today.

688
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:28,022
I'll stay here all night.

689
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:29,190
For me? I'm nobody.

690
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,441
You're an incredible person.

691
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,068
You make me break existing rules...

692
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:33,778
and create new rules that didn't exist.

693
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:35,113
Do you want to be friends?

694
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:37,657
So you did leave the wedding for her.

695
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,825
Are you really my son?

696
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:41,536
Am I not your son if I don't act
like the human Nam Shin?

697
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:44,372
I need the real Shin.

698
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:47,333
You were too cruel to Ye-na.

699
00:59:47,458 --> 00:59:49,669
You're the one who hurt her more.

700
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,714
Think about what you did
to the man your child loves.

701
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,716
He isn't human.

702
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:56,426
He said he couldn't be human.

703
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:57,802
Who are you?

704
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,263
Just what are you?

705
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,017
