LOADING... COMPLETE!

2
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,960
Hello. I'm an AI, Nam Shin I.

3
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:47,589
Mom.

4
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:52,093
-The first person I saw was Mom.
-Shin.

5
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:55,180
MOTHER

6
00:00:55,805 --> 00:00:57,557
I've missed you.

7
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:01,061
The rule is that I hug you when you cry.

8
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:06,066
And my first rule was meant for Mom too.

9
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:11,446
This woman, who is currently detected
by my visual sensor.

10
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:16,659
Tin Can, if you let anyone
touch your battery, I'll kill you.

11
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,371
Manual:
A rule for Kang So-bong is added.

12
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,837
From now on,
I will protect Kang So-bong...

13
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,173
as my number one priority.

14
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:35,595
Number one?
Why was a rule like that added?

15
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:39,808
Nam Shin, you crazy bastard!

16
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,227
My first reasoning:

17
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:46,606
Because I became accustomed
to her violent behavioral patterns?

18
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,443
Starting today, you're my slave robot.

19
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,529
-My second reasoning:
-Hold the umbrella.

20
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,447
-Bring it in, slave robot.
-Sure.

21
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,325
Only do what I say.

22
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:59,953
-Go get the car.
-Sure.

23
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,414
Because of an algorithm that became
suitable for the slave robot role?

24
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,960
My last reasoning:

25
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:11,798
What are you doing?

26
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,264
Is this a result
of excessive skin contact?

27
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,685
I'm unable to figure it out.

28
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:27,313
How did this woman change me?

29
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:39,325
What are you doing, Mr. Nam?
We should help Ms. Suh up.

30
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:45,248
Let go of me!

31
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,708
Are you guys playing me?

32
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,964
People are watching.
Act like it's a lovers' quarrel.

33
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,175
-Are they a love triangle?
-It must be.

34
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,218
-Are they fighting?
-I think so.

35
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,469
What's going on?

36
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,847
-Did the guy cheat?
-I think so.

37
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,599
Escort her to the car.

38
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:07,103
-Did the guy cheat?
-I think so.

39
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,439
-It must be true.
-Yeah.

40
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:12,901
-He must be a weirdo.
-Just keep walking.

41
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,321
You better not post about this
on social media.

42
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,749
-Let's apologize.
-Apologize?

43
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:32,253
Yes. You should apologize
for using force on your fiancée.

44
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:35,215
Who said I'd accept a robot's apology?

45
00:03:36,007 --> 00:03:39,928
What's with you two?
"Don't treat Kang So-bong that way"?

46
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:41,638
It looked like you were about to kill me.

47
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,350
Kill you? Don't exaggerate.

48
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,727
You were the one who kicked me first.

49
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:50,146
That's why Mr. Nam helped me.

50
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:53,358
-You're seriously--
-Then do you have a better idea?

51
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,236
Who else can pretend to be Mr. Nam?

52
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,865
You need him until Mr. Nam wakes up.

53
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:04,202
Why are you looking down on him
when you're in the same boat?

54
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:08,206
He has a brain too.
You could piss him off.

55
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,338
Let's pretend nothing happened today,
okay?

56
00:04:16,214 --> 00:04:20,969
Shall we go back to pretending a fiancé
is taking his beloved fiancée home?

57
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,683
Mr. Nam,
please don't forget your seat belts.

58
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,465
-Wait, Dr. Oh.
-Move.

59
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,261
I came to see you, not that old man.

60
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,432
Nam Geon-ho is no longer qualified
to be the owner of the PK Group.

61
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,519
That old and sickly man...

62
00:05:12,228 --> 00:05:14,605
should go to a comfortable nursing home.

63
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:20,611
He needs to finish his life there
so that we get a chance.

64
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:28,328
The "we" that Jong-gil's referring to
doesn't include your son.

65
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:32,582
I hate you just as much as you hate me...

66
00:05:35,376 --> 00:05:36,794
but...

67
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:40,631
we share a common enemy.

68
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,023
How does it feel to see your son again?

69
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,650
Isn't it nice?

70
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:08,076
Shin. Shin.

71
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,665
Shin, open your eyes.
This is your mom. Please Shin.

72
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,754
How could you ask such a thing?

73
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,549
You were the one
who kept my son away from me.

74
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,971
I wanted to deny it for a long time...

75
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,975
but Shin is your son after all.

76
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,230
-What did you say?
-That pathetic and lethargic punk

77
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:42,527
suddenly became very motivated,
which surprised me quite a bit.

78
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:46,364
I watched over him for 20 years...

79
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,575
but he's like a different person now.

80
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:56,499
It turns out he became that way
after he reunited with you.

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,504
It wasn't my son's weak blood,
but your strong blood

82
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:04,257
that changed him.

83
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,384
Don't talk about Jung-woo that way.

84
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,638
He might have been labeled
as a weak person

85
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,515
but he wasn't actually weak.

86
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,561
I'm trying to protect your son
because my son died out of weakness.

87
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,688
Don't talk back to me
and join the company

88
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:24,777
before Jong-gil
steals your son's position.

89
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,947
Why?

90
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,243
Were you reminded of me
after getting betrayed by Suh Jong-gil

91
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:35,580
whom you cherished
more than your own son?

92
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,707
What a thought.

93
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:42,587
Isn't it normal for people and situations
to change over time?

94
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,504
No.

95
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,633
I haven't changed a bit,
and neither has my situation.

96
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,845
I will never do as you ask

97
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,224
so put Ms. Ji
in that position instead.

98
00:07:55,933 --> 00:07:57,685
I understand why you hate me.

99
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:02,231
But your son
desperately needs my position.

100
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,194
Don't let your emotions
get the best of you

101
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,613
and think with your head.

102
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:13,034
If you do, you'll end up
doing as I suggest.

103
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:19,081
It's up to you to convince her.

104
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,756
I won't do that.

105
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,342
You can't control me too!

106
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,016
Please calm down, Dr. Oh.

107
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:42,355
We don't know when that old man
will catch on about Shin.

108
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,358
We have to make Shin be more careful.

109
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,568
He sees it as a positive change for now

110
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,278
but I'll keep a closer eye on him.

111
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:16,722
The wedding date will be set soon,
and we're going dress shopping tomorrow.

112
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,267
Keep your guard up, Shin.

113
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,906
Hey, why did you do that earlier?

114
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,159
I'll drive.

115
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:54,927
Look at you. I won't overlook this one.

116
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,055
Why did you do that earlier?

117
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,267
I don't know.

118
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:04,478
I'm not fully aware of the developments
of my deep neural network.

119
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:07,064
Stop using technical terms.

120
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:11,235
I'm your guard when we're outside.
Why are you protecting me?

121
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,529
Do you think that's helpful to me?

122
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,906
If Ms. Ji and your mom find out

123
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,491
I'll be misunderstood.

124
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,621
-I'm sorry.
-Then stop doing these things.

125
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,457
But thanks for what you did earlier.

126
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:25,875
Pardon?

127
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,252
Are you surprised that I'm thanking you?

128
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,298
And I'll apologize on Suh Ye-na's behalf.

129
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,551
What's so great about being human?

130
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,347
She keeps talking
about how you're not human.

131
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:42,642
My father taught me to be respectful
even to neighborhood cats and dogs.

132
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,730
As a fellow human,
I'm sincerely sorry, Tin Can.

133
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,400
What do you think?

134
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,862
I'm a pretty cool human
compared to Ms. Suh, aren't I?

135
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,624
Hello, Grandfather.
I'm on my way back.

136
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,125
Yes, sir.

137
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,755
What? Does the chairman
want to talk to you?

138
00:11:14,548 --> 00:11:16,050
Did something happen?

139
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,845
Something's off about them.

140
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:30,606
Mr. Nam seems to be closer
to his guard than your daughter.

141
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:34,235
That guard is with us. There's no way.

142
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,196
You said she was the one who saw
a patient that looked like Shin.

143
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:40,908
Do you really believe
that she was mistaken?

144
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:46,455
If that woman is lying,
that means my guess is right.

145
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,334
I'm talking about the possibility
of another Nam Shin existing.

146
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:55,089
I want to believe that possibility,
but there's no definite proof!

147
00:11:57,216 --> 00:12:01,762
Next time, bring me an answer
instead of a guess.

148
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,358
Let me ask you one question.

149
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:17,361
Are you really greedy for the company?

150
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,448
If I am, will you give it to me?

151
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:22,116
Just answer my question.

152
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:27,580
If that means I'll keep my position, yes.

153
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,501
Is that greed yours or someone else's?

154
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:38,549
I'm asking because you changed
after meeting your mom.

155
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,803
Are you suggesting I changed
because of my mom's greed?

156
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,305
That's right.

157
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,143
I like what I'm seeing these days
a lot better than what I saw

158
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,479
in the last 20 years

159
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:56,776
but if you didn't cause that change,
doesn't that make it fake?

160
00:12:57,818 --> 00:13:00,821
I'm not the Nam Shin from the past,
but the Nam Shin of the present

161
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:03,949
and I was the one who decided
to change myself, not my mom.

162
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,788
That's good.

163
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,166
I'll slowly transition you
into my position

164
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:17,588
but you have to get your mom
and Young-hoon to help you.

165
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,633
You can't let them be greedy.

166
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,470
When I told your mom to help you

167
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,556
she told me to give
Young-hoon that position.

168
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,687
Why do you think I picked Young-hoon?

169
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,610
Most young people don't know their place
and try to get whatever they want

170
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,987
but he was different.

171
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,698
He knew his place...

172
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,452
and didn't get greedy.

173
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:54,166
You mustn't give him any other position
than the one he has now.

174
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:59,004
If you give way,
they'll always want more.

175
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:04,134
Watch over Young-hoon so that
he doesn't become another Jong-gil.

176
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,428
Mr. Nam, turn it off.

177
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:14,854
He must have liked you quite a bit
if he's considering giving you his spot.

178
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,858
This is good,
but you should be extra careful.

179
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,194
Reorganize the team
for the automated car tomorrow.

180
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,321
I'll arrange a meeting
for tomorrow morning.

181
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,619
He's so chill.

182
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,540
"Watch over Young-hoon so that
he doesn't become another Jong-gil."

183
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:37,293
If I were him,
I would have been pissed off.

184
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:46,051
If the meeting's tomorrow morning,
we have to leave at dawn.

185
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,763
You're lucky you don't sleep.

186
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,623
-What's the matter?
-The chairman is suspicious of you.

187
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:20,711
Most people would be furious at that.
Why aren't you mad at all?

188
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,632
I'll take care of my own emotions.
You can go.

189
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:31,263
Why don't people realize that you have
no interest in the human Nam Shin's spot?

190
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:34,183
Even I know, and I'm a robot.

191
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,480
Don't cross the line. I'm warning you.

192
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,983
Your job is to protect Shin's position.

193
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,693
Focus on doing that.

194
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,863
I'm capable of more than you think.

195
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,200
Because you're human,
you get mad and upset.

196
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,663
But I don't have complicated emotions
or care about what's right or wrong.

197
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,375
I'll just listen to you
when you want to talk

198
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,002
so let me know whenever you need me.

199
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,988
It's really nice to see you again,
Mr. Nam.

200
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,617
-Are you sure about that?
-Pardon?

201
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,997
Why would it be nice to see a director
who was on standby for messing up?

202
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:42,543
I'll do my best to earn your favor.

203
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:44,003
Please sit down.

204
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,380
Yes, sir.

205
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,432
Aren't these papers
on quantum cryptography?

206
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,351
-It's the latest technology.
-Yes.

207
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,813
Other companies are using it to
commercialize a hacking preventing chip.

208
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:08,277
Why is that bastard
acting like a know-it-all?

209
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,239
He must have picked it up somewhere.

210
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,868
Since this technology sets off an alarm
when a hacking takes place

211
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:18,495
it would be a great help to our M Car.

212
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:22,124
We've already met with the company.
This is from the meeting.

213
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,595
Is this for real? He pretends to work.

214
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,930
Did his grandfather cancel his black card?

215
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,685
He went abroad before the PT
and fled during the road test.

216
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,396
Will he run away from his wedding too?

217
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,234
Go Chang-jo?

218
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,070
Yes, Mr. Nam? Did you read it over?

219
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:53,906
I'm not going to run away
from my wedding.

220
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,283
Um...

221
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,036
I never got a black card
from my grandfather either.

222
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,164
And I'm Nam Shin, not "that bastard."

223
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,629
I'm actually really curious.

224
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,714
How did you know?

225
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,092
I'm more skilled than you think.

226
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:17,137
I'm not the old Nam Shin anymore,
so I suggest you keep your guard up.

227
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,241
I heard Mr. Nam came to work.

228
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,701
He's very motivated, isn't he?

229
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,080
He formally returned
due to the chairman's request.

230
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:45,082
You must be happy.

231
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:51,088
But people should know
that you're the one behind Mr. Nam.

232
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,465
I'm simply doing my job. I'll be going.

233
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,510
Did the chairman...

234
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,013
call you his grandson, by any chance?

235
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:10,649
"Call me 'Grandfather.'
I have two grandsons now."

236
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:11,859
Anything like that?

237
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:14,319
The chairman isn't that affectionate.

238
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,823
You'll hear it soon.

239
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,908
That's how he got me.

240
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:24,538
But don't fall for his words.

241
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:27,541
He's cold one minute, but warm the next.

242
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,127
By pulling you back and forth

243
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,380
he's training you to be a loyal dog.

244
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,676
Are you sure
you didn't go back and forth willingly?

245
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,723
You might think of yourself as a dog

246
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,226
but I don't think of myself as an animal.

247
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,860
We have the same background.

248
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:58,280
We were both orphans
and PK Foundation scholarship students.

249
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,200
I think of you as a comrade.

250
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,660
Let's try to get along.

251
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,800
Mr. Nam came to work.

252
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,346
He presided over a meeting regarding
the automated car team's reorganization

253
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,597
and went to a wedding shop.

254
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:27,100
It's normal for a director
to come to work.

255
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:32,814
Is that so special
that you came to report it to me?

256
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:35,567
I came to tell you
that you don't have to worry.

257
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:37,444
-About what?
-Chairman Nam.

258
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,115
I'm not another Suh Jong-gil.

259
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,286
I guess...

260
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,872
Shin told you what I said.

261
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:52,459
Why do you treat us the same
just because we have the same background?

262
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:56,171
Are all orphans that came here
through the company's scholarship

263
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,549
expected to be greedy
for other people's opportunities?

264
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:05,555
Didn't you say I know my place
and don't get greedy?

265
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:12,229
I don't need any other position here.

266
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,817
I'll prove to you
that your judgment was correct...

267
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:22,197
so please refrain from making
such an unpleasant comparison.

268
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,996
When you told me
to call you "Grandfather"...

269
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:33,250
I felt comforted.

270
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,880
But you will always be
the chairman to me.

271
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:42,342
I'll be going.

272
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:56,023
That punk just stabbed me a few times...

273
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,443
with his eyes.

274
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,138
You can't take pictures.

275
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,060
A lot of people try to steal our designs.

276
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,438
I'm sorry. It's her first time
coming to a place like this.

277
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,566
Don't you know basic etiquette?

278
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:43,153
-I'm sorry.
-I've seen people like that.

279
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,656
Since they can't come to places like this
for their own weddings

280
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,867
we should be understanding.

281
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:52,245
I'll bring you in for a fitting
as soon as you pick out a dress.

282
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,710
Shin, I'll go with whatever you like.

283
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,380
Okay. That one.

284
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,679
You know you have to have
a killer reaction, right?

285
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:13,600
It has to look like you think
she's pretty, cute, and sexy.

286
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,021
I know what humans think
is pretty, cute, and sexy.

287
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,899
I just don't know what that feels like.

288
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:24,194
I'm telling you to act like you do.

289
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,195
Okay.

290
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:44,172
Your fiancé can't
take his eyes off of you.

291
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,845
Can you wait outside?

292
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,431
I want some privacy.

293
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,641
Sure. Call me when you're ready.

294
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,194
Take a picture of me.

295
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,447
Pardon?

296
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,199
Take a picture
so I can show the real Shin.

297
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,827
It's a rule to not take any pictures.

298
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,329
For me, it's a rule
to do whatever I want.

299
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:17,414
Do it.

300
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,294
I'll take one for you.
You look so beautiful.

301
00:24:33,388 --> 00:24:37,642
What are you doing?
I told you not to take pictures.

302
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,644
I told you not to do it.

303
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,272
Why didn't you listen to me?

304
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,443
Are you laughing?

305
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:52,741
Is your job to humiliate your superiors
in places like this?

306
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:57,162
If you work for them, you should behave
according to their standards.

307
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,168
I'll let it go just this once.
Watch your behavior.

308
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:04,628
I'm sorry.

309
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,590
What are you sorry for?

310
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:12,052
I told you to do it.

311
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,680
Is it that wrong
to take a picture of my beautiful bride?

312
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,518
"Watch your behavior"?
Was that meant for me?

313
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,188
Pardon? I wouldn't dare!

314
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,774
I apologize, Mr. Nam.

315
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,944
Please take as many pictures as you want

316
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,029
and forgive me.

317
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,656
Isn't it a rule?

318
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:36,576
Are rules that important?

319
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,789
It's just an honor to serve VIPs
such as yourself.

320
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,340
Ye-na, how about a picture together?

321
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,676
I'll do it!

322
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:58,473
Ready? Please pose
in a sweet and sexy way.

323
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,850
Are you crazy? Go away.

324
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:04,563
If you're going to act, do it properly.
I'm the human Nam Shin right now.

325
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,356
So what?

326
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,276
Didn't I warn you
not to treat Kang So-bong that way?

327
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:12,821
Good! How about a different pose?

328
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,535
I need to use the bathroom.

329
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,703
Oh, of course.

330
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,081
Right this way.

331
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:56,906
"Don't treat Kang So-bong that way"?

332
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,619
You told him to say that, didn't you?

333
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:05,624
I won't forgive you
for ganging up on me this time.

334
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,500
Find your own way back.

335
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:28,438
Why do you keep making me thankful?

336
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:31,608
Call a taxi so we can follow Ms. Suh.

337
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:32,692
No.

338
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,904
Hey. Where are you going?

339
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,198
Where are you going?

340
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:46,247
Are you sure you have time for this?
What if Ms. Suh rats you out?

341
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,416
Wow, there are so many people.

342
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,752
I haven't been to a place like this
since coming to Korea.

343
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,798
Then I'm only giving you
five minutes, okay?

344
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,974
Hey, did you see that?

345
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,602
Both their faces and bodies
are beautiful.

346
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,355
They caught my eye, even for a girl.

347
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,982
How could you pass by visuals like that?

348
00:28:13,692 --> 00:28:16,611
You have no emotions or desires,
but why am I surprised?

349
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,281
-Your face and body are beautiful too.
-What?

350
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:30,542
What's that?

351
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,128
I saw you staring at that dress.

352
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,172
I put your face on Suh Ye-na's body.

353
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:40,719
I also made you a little taller
with more voluptuous breasts.

354
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,429
I adjusted it to the size.

355
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:46,057
I told you to stop doing that.
Take that down!

356
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,308
Look at it objectively.

357
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,520
If you look at your facial symmetry
and body proportions

358
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,481
you qualify as someone
with a beautiful face and body.

359
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:02,282
I knew this would happen.
Ms. Ji wants us.

360
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,577
Take that down before I tell your mom.

361
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,304
Is that true, Kang So-bong?

362
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:27,974
Did Shin really attack Ms. Suh?

363
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:30,810
Ms. Suh started it.

364
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:35,356
She made Mr. Nam stand against the wall
like a child and took out his battery.

365
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,527
She attacked me when I confronted her
about it, and that's why he stepped in.

366
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:43,239
-Is that what happened?
-Do you think he's a toy?

367
00:29:43,323 --> 00:29:45,909
You can't put him against the wall
and take out his battery.

368
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,327
What's wrong with you people?

369
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:50,955
Do you expect me to treat him like Shin
even when no one's around?

370
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,458
Treat him like Mr. Nam regardless.

371
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:55,335
Your daily behavior could slip out
by accident.

372
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:58,213
Wait, are you saying I'm the problem?

373
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,965
The problem is that he doesn't listen
because of Kang So-bong.

374
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,842
You shouldn't treat people badly.

375
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:06,221
-No matter who it is.
-Look at him.

376
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,807
Did you see that?

377
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,643
I expect you to take care of this.

378
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:20,735
Kang So-bong, what did you do to Shin?

379
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:21,861
Me?

380
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,990
I didn't do anything.

381
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,160
Mom, this isn't Kang So-bong's fault.

382
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:35,708
What's wrong with you? What went wrong?

383
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,086
It's not his fault
that a new rule was added.

384
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,337
Let go.

385
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,382
I made you to be perfect.
Why are you being weird?

386
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,218
Why aren't you obeying me
like you always have?

387
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:48,847
-Calm down, Dr. Oh.
-Shin!

388
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:58,606
What's the matter?

389
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,317
His blood pressure dropped rapidly,
but it came back up.

390
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,987
He's okay now. You don't have to worry.

391
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,156
I thought something happened to him.

392
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,159
Don't die, Shin.

393
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:11,619
Who said he's going to die?

394
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:14,163
If you're going to say horrible things,
get out.

395
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,312
Hey, let's go.

396
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,649
Young-hoon.

397
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,957
I'll drive today.

398
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,959
Why?

399
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:03,046
Just because.

400
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,217
Please get in, Mr. Nam.

401
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:49,884
Mom was crying, but I couldn't hug her.

402
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:55,974
It's because Kang So-bong said I should
only comfort people when they want it.

403
00:32:56,057 --> 00:33:00,979
Mom would rather be with the human
Nam Shin than get my comfort.

404
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,989
Tin Can, what are you doing
with the vacuum?

405
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,615
Kang So-bong.

406
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,369
This is my friend. I met him here.

407
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,537
Your friend?

408
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:22,208
Oh, because it's a robot too?

409
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:28,089
You might think that way,
but what does he think?

410
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:35,805
Look at you.
Are you siding with your friend?

411
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,851
Do you want to do some volunteer work
with your friend?

412
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,573
That corner over there.

413
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,617
Over there.

414
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,292
No way. Your friend listens to you.

415
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:07,128
You're a perfect robot match.

416
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:17,096
Hey. Isn't your mom being too mean?

417
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:20,266
She's all over that human
Nam Shin after putting you in this house.

418
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:26,564
That's okay.
The human Nam Shin is Mom's son too.

419
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:30,693
Aren't you her son too? Tell her you
won't cooperate if she treats you badly.

420
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,738
Rebel by telling her you'll go around
telling everyone you're a robot.

421
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,074
-Rebel?
-That's right.

422
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,452
Kids are supposed to rebel
against their parents.

423
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,580
Look at me. I do everything
my dad doesn't want me to do.

424
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:46,084
That just sounds like a rationalization
of your own behavior.

425
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,210
What?

426
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:50,004
The human Nam Shin
has the right to be with Mom too.

427
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,759
He was all alone
in the time that I was with her.

428
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:56,928
Is this the time to worry
about the human Nam Shin?

429
00:34:57,011 --> 00:34:59,514
If you have that much time,
do some more cleaning.

430
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:07,605
Come here. I want a robot friend too.

431
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,525
I said, come here.

432
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,449
Do you only make friends with robots?

433
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:20,535
Are you looking down on humans?

434
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:22,829
That's discrimination, you know.

435
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:29,961
That's more like it.

436
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,464
Did you see that?
I think we're friends too.

437
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:42,557
Didn't you have friends before?
Where did you live before this?

438
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:50,356
It's beautiful. Where was that?

439
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,693
Karlovy Vary in the Czech Republic.

440
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,528
That's where I was made.

441
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,156
Did you live there with your mom?

442
00:35:58,823 --> 00:35:59,824
Yes.

443
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,744
Mom was my creator, family, and friend.

444
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:08,791
But the human Nam Shin
took her away from you.

445
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,836
You must have been sad.

446
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:14,964
I don't know what sadness is.

447
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,595
Hey, put up my picture.

448
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:26,267
The wedding dress picture
from earlier today.

449
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,436
Oh, sure.

450
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,943
I didn't realize this earlier

451
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:39,363
but I have a v-line, an s-line,
and everything in between.

452
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:44,243
I wish I looked like that all the time.

453
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,926
What's that? Is that me?

454
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,636
That's the Kang So-bong I see.

455
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:06,015
She's close to the ideal beauty
that humans talk about.

456
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,353
Wow, what a goddess.

457
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,939
I like the vibe.

458
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,068
First, you cleaned my room,
and now you're cheering me up?

459
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:20,279
You're the best slave I could ever have.

460
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,615
You're the best owner I could ever have.

461
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,117
I got this far without getting caught,
thanks to you.

462
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,501
Let go! Let go of me!

463
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,589
That was after I kissed you.

464
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,176
Why did you put that up?
Do you want to die?

465
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,636
Turn it off.

466
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,849
Don't cover it. Keep watching.

467
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,227
When did I say I'd help you with my lips?

468
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,854
If you were human,
this would be sexual harassment!

469
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,400
What would have happened if I was human?

470
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:00,444
What?

471
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,197
If I were human...

472
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,785
would you have gotten mad at me
for kissing you?

473
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:23,259
I'm sorry.

474
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:26,345
I know you hate making
physical contact with me.

475
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,647
Hello, Mr. Suh.

476
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,817
Kang So-bong, let's meet.

477
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,945
I sent my car to pick you up.

478
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,031
Sure, I'll see you soon.

479
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:52,455
-Let's go together.
-No way. Don't follow me.

480
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,540
I protect you as my number one priority.

481
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,417
Suh Jong-gil is dangerous.

482
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,130
You should only protect people
when they want it.

483
00:39:01,797 --> 00:39:03,591
Don't follow me, okay?

484
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,186
We're here.

485
00:39:58,896 --> 00:40:02,108
-Where are we?
-He's waiting upstairs.

486
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,390
Something's off
about that electronic display.

487
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:37,143
I called the advertising agency

488
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:41,230
and they said no wedding dress photos
were transmitted at that time.

489
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:47,027
They did complain of an unknown error
cutting off the transmission though.

490
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,948
Then how did this picture get up there?

491
00:40:51,365 --> 00:40:53,075
I'm not sure about that

492
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:57,037
but I think Kang So-bong
and Mr. Nam's mother are involved.

493
00:40:57,830 --> 00:41:01,292
I heard Kang So-bong talking about
Mr. Nam's mother.

494
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,794
They're definitely hiding something.

495
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,905
Mr. Nam's mother?

496
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,406
That's right.

497
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,868
Find out where that woman is staying.

498
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,829
I have to meet her at least once
before the wedding

499
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,248
so do whatever you have to do
to find her.

500
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:47,087
What? You don't think you can do it?

501
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,089
It's not that.

502
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,927
I'm just curious
why you're acting this way.

503
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,515
Why are you asking me questions?

504
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,559
Shouldn't you just do as I ask?

505
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:05,022
I'm sorry. I overstepped my boundaries.

506
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:10,528
To be honest,
I've been thinking a lot about your use.

507
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:15,407
You still haven't found anything on Shin.

508
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:21,872
If you fail again, I'll have no choice
but to think of it as intentional.

509
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,085
But then again...

510
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:31,715
from your point of view,
money is probably just money...

511
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,926
no matter who it's from.

512
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,431
I don't blame you for being suspicious.

513
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:41,684
I'll do whatever it takes
to find out this time.

514
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:44,228
I'll clear my name then.

515
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,273
As you should.

516
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:51,360
Betrayal is a tiring thing.
Don't you agree?

517
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,736
It is.

518
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:56,740
So please don't call me out like this
ever again.

519
00:42:56,865 --> 00:43:01,870
You don't know
if I'm going to betray you or not.

520
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,367
NAM SHIN

521
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:47,374
Please leave a message after a tone.

522
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:25,788
So-bong?

523
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,832
It's me.

524
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:32,503
What happened to you?

525
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:37,508
There she is! Kill her!

526
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,469
-You're dead!
-Run!

527
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:42,513
Hurry!

528
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,518
What did you say?

529
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:51,522
Fans went to your house just because
you wrote one bad article about an idol?

530
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:56,402
They broke my windows
and threw flour at me.

531
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:59,947
They've been camping out
in front of my house for days.

532
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,241
I might have to sleep at a motel.

533
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:04,243
You should have known better.

534
00:45:04,326 --> 00:45:06,954
There's nothing more powerful
than idol fandom these days.

535
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,625
What about you?

536
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,503
You never come to me
unless you're worried about something.

537
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,344
I think Mr. Suh is suspicious of me.

538
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:25,347
So it finally happened, huh?

539
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:31,061
How could he not be suspicious
after how lovey-dovey you've been?

540
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,646
We weren't lovey-dovey.

541
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:34,648
In any case, just quit.

542
00:45:34,732 --> 00:45:38,026
Give Mr. Nam an excuse
and get out of there.

543
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:42,197
Director Suh and Mr. Nam
are both powerful people.

544
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:47,786
If you get in between them,
your heart and brain will explode.

545
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:53,041
You already made a lot of money.
Get out of there.

546
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,338
I'll protect you no matter what.

547
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,883
Because I'm your guard.

548
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,892
You're being weird.
Why aren't you answering?

549
00:46:11,185 --> 00:46:14,271
-Just do as I say.
-Do you think it's that easy?

550
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:18,066
Forget I said anything
and go to the gym in the morning.

551
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,359
My room's empty.

552
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:24,531
Are you out of battery?

553
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,284
Excuse me!

554
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,996
Can you charge this?

555
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:31,914
Yes.

556
00:46:36,126 --> 00:46:40,130
-Kang So-bong dropped this.
-What? That little...

557
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,382
I can't contact her
because her phone is off.

558
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,927
That little wench.

559
00:46:49,389 --> 00:46:52,601
GPS SYSTEM
SEARCHING

560
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:54,978
What? What are you looking at?

561
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,814
Oh, it's back on.

562
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,566
Kang So-bong's location is secured.

563
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,402
She's in Imun-dong. I'll be going.

564
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,987
Where do you think you're going?

565
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:06,448
Stop right there. Stand straight.

566
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:13,330
Imun-dong is where that Reporter Jo
lives, so don't worry about it.

567
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:19,461
And you. Who are you to check
Kang So-bong's location at this hour?

568
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:23,298
Kang So-bong's your guard,
not the other way around.

569
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,718
You act so weird.

570
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,387
Follow me inside.

571
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,277
This is...

572
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:49,116
my first time talking one-on-one
with someone in a high position

573
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,701
so I'm a little shabby.

574
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:54,705
These are shots of courage, got it?

575
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:04,673
Hey, look me in the eyes.

576
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:06,091
Look me in the eyes!

577
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:12,097
What's your relationship
with my daughter?

578
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,809
-Are you dating?
-No.

579
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:18,687
That's only possible between two humans.

580
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:20,147
So...

581
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,818
are you saying you're human,
but my daughter isn't?

582
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,654
-It's the opposite of that.
-Opposite?

583
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:33,952
So my daughter is just an average person

584
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,872
while rich heirs like you

585
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:40,500
are beings that surpass all humans?

586
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,841
Regardless of who's human and who's not

587
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,385
you shouldn't live your lives that way.

588
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:52,930
Do you think money is everything?

589
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:58,518
You think I'm ecstatic that Kang So-bong
is associated with you, don't you?

590
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:03,440
Do you think I'm sitting here
hoping for something to fall into my lap?

591
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:08,195
Yeah right. Money disgusts me.

592
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,822
I wouldn't take it
even if someone offered it to me!

593
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:15,786
Lies. You'd take it if someone offered.

594
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:28,215
Yeah. If someone offered,
I'd probably take it.

595
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,053
Because of money...

596
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:37,683
our So-bong's life is over.

597
00:49:39,977 --> 00:49:43,772
Because of money, she lost a match
that she was supposed to win...

598
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:48,110
got a metal pin in her leg...

599
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:50,779
and lost her future as an athlete.

600
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,367
If...

601
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:01,164
If I was a rich heir like you...

602
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:04,584
my daughter wouldn't
have gone through that.

603
00:50:05,252 --> 00:50:08,839
She'd probably be killing it
in the ring right now.

604
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,219
Sir. Sir.

605
00:50:14,344 --> 00:50:18,306
Do you know how cool
So-bong looked in the ring?

606
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:22,561
She glares at her opponent like this

607
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:26,314
and does a one-two straight, a left body

608
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,692
and a right body.

609
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,695
They're all dead.

610
00:51:01,558 --> 00:51:04,686
-Hello?
-Where are you? Why aren't you home?

611
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,230
-I'm at the gym.
-Why are you at the gym?

612
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,149
Are you with Kang So-bong?

613
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:12,944
No. I'm with Kang So-bong's father.

614
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:14,404
Kang So-bong's father?

615
00:51:17,657 --> 00:51:21,787
I can't move right now.
I'll go back later.

616
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,585
He really reminds me of Shin.

617
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:31,671
Seriously.

618
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:51,525
Mr. Nam woke up with a fever--

619
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:55,195
Let him be. I called you
so we could go to work together.

620
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,990
Everything you said yesterday was right.

621
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:03,578
I won't treat you
like Jong-gil ever again.

622
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:08,125
I won't ask you
to call me "Grandfather" either.

623
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:09,709
You cold bastard.

624
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:14,005
-Thank you, Chairman Nam.
-The reporters will call you soon.

625
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:16,049
Tell them that date is correct.

626
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:19,094
Pardon? Which date...

627
00:52:24,558 --> 00:52:26,893
Hello? This is Ji Young-hoon.

628
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:27,936
Yes.

629
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:32,107
Oh, Mr. Nam's wedding date?

630
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:35,193
Yes, that's correct.

631
00:52:59,968 --> 00:53:01,136
Okay, Reporter Jo.

632
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,222
I'll tell them I'm quitting,
so go to the gym already.

633
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:16,318
You announced the wedding date
without discussing it with me.

634
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:19,196
Are you upset?

635
00:53:20,113 --> 00:53:22,407
Isn't it better to get it done
as quickly as possible?

636
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,409
Of course.

637
00:53:24,743 --> 00:53:27,162
Mr. Nam should find some stability

638
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:29,789
and return to the self-driving car team

639
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:32,959
so that I can back down
and cheer from the sidelines.

640
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:37,964
Speaking of which...

641
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:42,302
I have a friend who could help
Mr. Nam lead the self-driving car team.

642
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,137
That's my position.

643
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:53,813
Didn't you say you'd leave the team
in my hands, Chairman?

644
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:59,236
I thought you turned me down.
I guess not.

645
00:54:01,154 --> 00:54:05,116
Mr. Ji convinced me,
sincerely and persistently.

646
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:11,665
Plus, I have no reason to keep hiding

647
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:13,875
since I did nothing wrong.

648
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,170
Thank you, Dr. Oh.

649
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,256
Don't mention it.

650
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:23,718
But I'm worried about Shin.
Where could he have gone?

651
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:26,846
I'm sure things will get better
now that you're here.

652
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:30,600
Don't worry too much.
We have a last resort method.

653
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:33,895
You're talking about
the kill switch, aren't you?

654
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:38,483
Will he really be destroyed
if we flick that switch?

655
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:42,320
I hope we won't have to anytime soon.

656
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,489
But if Shin wakes up,
we'll have no choice.

657
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,701
Let's go.

658
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:55,709
Destroy?

659
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:59,462
That's the same thing as killing him.

660
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:11,474
I'm at the gym, but guess who's here.

661
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:24,988
He said he was here all night.

662
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:29,743
His legs must be numb.
Who is he doing this for?

663
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:44,257
Just let him sleep. I'm completely fine.

664
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,635
You're talking about the kill switch,
right?

665
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:53,808
Will he really be destroyed
if we flick that switch?

666
00:55:53,892 --> 00:55:56,144
I hope we won't have to anytime soon.

667
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:59,230
But if Shin wakes up,
we'll have no choice.

668
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:03,735
How can you be so foolish? Get up.

669
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,614
Be quiet. If I get up, he'll wake up.

670
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,199
Get up, you idiot!

671
00:56:11,618 --> 00:56:12,827
Get up!

672
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:15,205
"You idiot"?
Did you just call him an idiot?

673
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,206
-So-bong!
-So-bong!

674
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,846
Why is a smart robot acting like this?

675
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:34,766
What did my dad do for you
to deserve your legs all night long?

676
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:37,394
Why did you come here?
Who gave you permission?

677
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:41,356
I looked everywhere for you
because your GPS was off.

678
00:56:41,439 --> 00:56:43,525
It's my rule to protect you.

679
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,028
I told you to forget that rule.

680
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:53,451
-What are you doing?
-As your slave, I should carry it.

681
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:01,793
Kang So-bong.

682
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,341
Don't do these kinds of things any more.

683
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,677
Why not?

684
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:15,598
Because I'm setting you free.

685
00:57:16,349 --> 00:57:18,017
You can stop running errands for me.

686
00:57:18,852 --> 00:57:19,769
Pardon?

687
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:22,564
You're not my Tin Can
or my servant anymore.

688
00:57:23,565 --> 00:57:26,192
You're not anyone's servant,
for that matter.

689
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:31,531
Don't listen to anyone, and behave
according to your own judgments.

690
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:37,120
I can't make my own decisions.

691
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,706
I have to act like the human Nam Shin.

692
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:43,543
Nam Shin is Nam Shin, and you're you!
You're your own person!

693
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:50,091
Kang So-bong.

694
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:05,815
Mr. Nam.

695
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:12,113
I'd like to resign
from my job as your guard.

696
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,700
Thank you for everything.

697
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:36,971
I finally figured out
why a rule was added for that woman.

698
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,932
I'll apologize on Suh Ye-na's behalf.

699
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:42,560
As a fellow human,
I'm sincerely sorry, Tin Can.

700
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,270
Isn't your mom being too mean?

701
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:48,066
She's all over that human
Nam Shin after putting you in this house.

702
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:52,862
Nam Shin is Nam Shin, and you're you!
You're your own person!

703
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,239
That woman...

704
00:58:56,824 --> 00:59:00,537
is the only person who sees me as me.

705
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:47,959
-Right here.
-Gosh.

706
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,836
-Are you really Shin?
-Where's your bodyguard?

707
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,379
Should I try seducing her?

708
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:55,633
-Do you want people to find out?
-I can't stop thinking about her.

709
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:58,219
-It's because of you.
-I keep picturing Kang So-bong.

710
00:59:58,303 --> 01:00:00,555
-But she won't come back again.
-Where are you?

711
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:02,432
Let me borrow him for a while.

712
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,935
