1
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:38,997
The human Nam Shin.

2
00:00:39,956 --> 00:00:41,708
Ask if I'm the only thing
that matters to her.

3
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:44,669
Ask if you're really nothing.

4
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,049
Is the human Nam Shin
all that matters to you?

5
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,218
Do I really mean nothing to you?

6
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,679
He controlled me like his avatar.

7
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,482
Wounded me intentionally.

8
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,276
MANUAL MODE

9
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,445
You're my toy now.

10
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,572
Go act like nothing happened.

11
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:14,240
Okay.

12
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,409
He plays with me like a toy.

13
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:21,664
I can't do this anymore.

14
00:01:23,416 --> 00:01:25,085
This isn't who I am.

15
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,295
Are you going to keep doing this?

16
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,755
No.

17
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,715
Let's not be discouraged.

18
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,342
Nothing wrong with being
a robot.

19
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,344
Don't hide.

20
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:38,473
It's time to stop pretending
to be the human Nam Shin.

21
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:41,726
Come to think of it,
when did you change your clothes?

22
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,063
-I'm a different Nam Shin.
-He's a robot.

23
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:47,398
He isn't the meanie Shin.

24
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,359
He's the kind robot Shin.

25
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:51,778
What? A robot?

26
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:53,446
Hee-dong is correct.

27
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,240
I'm a robot, Auntie.

28
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,243
I need your help
for Grandfather's and Hee-dong's sake.

29
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:00,495
There's no need to hide.

30
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:03,873
You figured it out before, right?

31
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:05,583
You're correct.

32
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:08,920
I'm a robot.

33
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,839
There's no need to hide it.

34
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,926
Because...

35
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,804
I'm not human.

36
00:02:26,729 --> 00:02:27,605
Who's the real one?

37
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,149
What's going on?

38
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:31,651
They look identical.

39
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,611
What's going on?

40
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:41,995
Hello. I planned and launched MediCar.

41
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,414
I'm an AI robot, Nam Shin 3.

42
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,757
THE DAY BEFORE
THE SHAREHOLDER'S MEETING

43
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,259
It'll be okay, right?

44
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,929
I'm the one who told him not to hide,

45
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,140
but now that we're about toÂ say
he's a robot,

46
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,058
I'm worried.

47
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,768
People will talk.

48
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,980
There will be unexpected events as well.

49
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:13,610
But I understand
why he wants to stop pretending.

50
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,029
I want to stop Shin,

51
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,781
and he doesn't want to hide
himself anymore.

52
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:24,078
We agreed to help each other,
so we must do our best.

53
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,497
That's right.

54
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,459
Unless you plan to move
to the countryside,

55
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,252
the truth will get out eventually.

56
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,546
Let's expose this once and for all.

57
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,091
I'll set the stage before
the meeting from outside.

58
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:39,385
"A robot can become this great."

59
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,929
"He is totally a hero."

60
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:53,775
The news is streaming!

61
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,236
He really must be a robot.

62
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,612
-How is that...
-It's true.

63
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,864
-What's going on?
-It's a robot?

64
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,793
We have shocking news.

65
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:14,545
At PK shareholders' meeting today,
an AI robot...

66
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,922
This is a robot?

67
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,632
It looks like a person.

68
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:20,301
-The world is changing indeed.
-It was confirmed...

69
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:21,928
that the Nam Shin
who saved...

70
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,222
people from the fire
was this AI robot.

71
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,224
-It's handsome.
-The robot stopped the accident...

72
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,850
-Gosh.
-during the self-driving car test.

73
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,560
The public is stunned at the news.

74
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:30,687
That's awesome.

75
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:33,022
He's crazy cute, too.

76
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,609
-He looks like a person.
-It seems like that really happened.

77
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,404
They say the Nam Shin
who saved people from the club...

78
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,031
was the robot.

79
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,368
It was also the robot
that stopped the accident...

80
00:04:45,451 --> 00:04:47,537
during the self-driving car test drive.

81
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,373
A LEAP IN AI TECHNOLOGY

82
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,230
HR Foundation,
which created the AI robot Nam Shin 3,

83
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:17,442
was established by Chairman Nam Gun-ho.

84
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,863
The chairman believed
the future of PK Group...

85
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:24,282
resided in artificial intelligence.

86
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,659
We are here for Mr. Nam Shin today.

87
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:30,913
He has also received
the chairman's shares already.

88
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,457
He revised the contract.

89
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:34,334
You didn't know?

90
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:35,835
Dad's shares...

91
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,172
went to Mr. Ji.

92
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,841
So did mine. It's a bonus.

93
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:50,850
STOCK TRANSFER AGREEMENT

94
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:51,934
ASSIGNEE: JI YOUNG-HOON

95
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,113
Young-hoon.

96
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,158
Is this true?

97
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,786
The chairman gave them to me, sir.

98
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,832
It was on the condition
that I operate PK...

99
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,585
with Nam Shin 3's AI technology
as the core.

100
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,255
I am the agent.
The true business manager...

101
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,175
is Nam Shin 3.

102
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,595
The robot will run the company?

103
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,566
Shin.

104
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,530
Let's go.

105
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,950
What's going on?

106
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:18,771
Are you trying to kill the company?

107
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,316
How could a stupid robot run the company?

108
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,627
What... What are you doing?

109
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,380
You may continue
if it will ease your anger.

110
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,217
I do not feel emotions or get upset.

111
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,178
Why you...

112
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,598
Your blood pressure is 158 over 102.

113
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,224
Your heart rate is 112.

114
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,935
If you get any more upset,
it'll strain your heart.

115
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,812
You should calm down.

116
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,317
What... Are you a doctor?

117
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,444
-That's enough.
-That's right.

118
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:08,196
Let's hear what they have to say!

119
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,073
-That's right.
-We should hear them out first.

120
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,459
The MediCar system is
like what you just saw.

121
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,838
It senses the driver's state
and acts accordingly.

122
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:28,799
However,

123
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,010
that is merely the beginning.

124
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:38,226
PK will take on a new project.

125
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,103
And that is M-City.

126
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,133
The city that you see is
a future smart city,

127
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,804
in which the environment,
accidents, and illnesses...

128
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,597
are completely regulated.

129
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,058
BUSINESS AGREEMENT

130
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:22,311
Through an alliance
and co-development of technology...

131
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:26,482
with the Transportation Safety Authority,

132
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:28,276
we will develop the infrastructure
for the roads,

133
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:33,281
commercialize environmentally friendly...

134
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,951
home and public fast charging stations
in the city.

135
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,581
And a smart AI air...

136
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,667
filtration system developed by experts
will be implemented...

137
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:48,337
to guarantee optimal air quality.

138
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,011
Will artificial intelligence...

139
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:58,472
stop at controlling M-City?

140
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:02,727
In the movies,
artificial intelligence attacks...

141
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,228
and rules over humans.

142
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,692
I am that very artificial intelligence.

143
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,362
I excel more than humans,

144
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:15,615
but I do not compete against humans.

145
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,826
I do not attack or rule over humans.

146
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:22,913
I meet their inadequacies
and learn their sensitivity.

147
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:28,169
To me, M-City is a city
where humans and I can cohabitate.

148
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:36,427
I want to be with humans.

149
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,806
Will you join this impossible dream...

150
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,516
of an artificial intelligence?

151
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:27,311
What? Why are you...

152
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,855
Mr. Ji asked me to come just in case.

153
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,565
He asked you?

154
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,693
He knew this would happen to me?

155
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,737
I have an ambulance waiting.
Let's go.

156
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,948
-Let go.
-Shin, please.

157
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,575
Shin.

158
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:56,966
How could you do this to me?

159
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,886
Say something.

160
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,722
Make an excuse. Anything!

161
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,619
Young-hoon.

162
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:28,789
-Shin.
-Mr. Nam.

163
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,166
Let's go.

164
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,636
"I'm a robot."

165
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,765
How does it feel to have
shocked the world?

166
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,476
I don't need to pretend to be
a human anymore.

167
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,144
That's more than enough.

168
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:54,440
True. It was very inconsistent
with your character.

169
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,859
I'm more worried about you.

170
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,402
Me?

171
00:12:59,069 --> 00:12:59,945
Why?

172
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,907
You're a human
that's close with a robot.

173
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,284
You'll be the target
of people's curiosity.

174
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,244
Stay apart from me when we're outside.

175
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,204
Don't act like we're close.

176
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,040
You told the truth.
Why are you telling me to lie?

177
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,625
I like being close with you.

178
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,046
I like that I like you.

179
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:22,968
I have something else
to come clean about only to you.

180
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,512
Only to me?

181
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:25,805
What is it?

182
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:27,848
Is it more shocking than being a robot?

183
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:32,978
If I had remained withÂ the human Nam Shin
or Mr. Suh,

184
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,857
I would've broken
the rules and hurt people.

185
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,489
I was able to protect
my identity thanks to you.

186
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,743
I was able to become
what I am because I was with you.

187
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,538
It's such a relief...

188
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,873
that I'm your robot.

189
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:57,753
I am your robot, So-bong.

190
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,757
My own robot.

191
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,718
I like that.

192
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,556
-And?
-And?

193
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,476
"I like you."

194
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,895
"I like you so much
that I could just die."

195
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,983
You should say something like that.

196
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:24,655
But again, liking and dying...

197
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:26,282
have nothing to do with you.

198
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,287
Okay, shall we go now...

199
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,746
into the mayhem?

200
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,208
Sure.

201
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,463
-He's coming.
-He's here.

202
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,886
Are you really a robot?
Who made you?

203
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,597
Did you save people
because it's the first rule

204
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,890
by Isaac Asimov?

205
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,474
Nam Shin 3 saved your life twice.

206
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,059
What is your relationship?

207
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:55,394
Please give us a statement.

208
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,277
-What...
-What is this?

209
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,868
-Please give us a statement.
-Did you know?

210
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,495
-Please give us a statement!
-Please.

211
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:17,207
-Please tell us something!
-Please tell us!

212
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,548
Are you really a robot?
Who made you?

213
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,009
What? Isn't... Isn't that him?

214
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,762
Shin is a robot? What...

215
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:31,513
What is your relationship?

216
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,724
Do you admit to being a robot?

217
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,226
Were you responsible
for Â the company's advancement?

218
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,732
Robocop!

219
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,153
Are you really a robot? No, right?

220
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,907
Hasn't he seen a robot before?

221
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:51,867
Why is he fainting?

222
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,204
That's right. Wake up.

223
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,165
Don't make me lift you, fatty.

224
00:15:58,707 --> 00:15:59,875
Why did you come?

225
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,212
Why did you come here
after dropping a bomb like that?

226
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,339
I had nowhere else to go.

227
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:08,801
I think people will hate me anywhere else.

228
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,852
Go get changed.

229
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:21,021
You should clean.

230
00:16:22,606 --> 00:16:24,108
Okay. I'll be right back.

231
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:32,908
Thanks, Dad.

232
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:35,869
My gosh.

233
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,939
It's a ticket to the Czech Republic.

234
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,234
I booked the soonest flight. Go with me.

235
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,466
The person who created MediCar...

236
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,427
was not Mr. Nam Shin.

237
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,762
He is...

238
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,097
another Mr. Nam Shin.

239
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:39,725
Hello.

240
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,144
I planned and launched MediCar.

241
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,605
I'm an AI robot, Nam Shin 3.

242
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,612
PK GROUP

243
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:09,463
NOTICE OF DISMISSAL
SUH JONG-GIL

244
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,723
Hey, you.
Have you lost your mind?

245
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:27,689
Why that little...

246
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,197
You seem to be enjoying life.

247
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,867
You moved intoÂ the chairman's office
already.

248
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,081
I don't plan to use such a grand office.

249
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,667
Jong-gil.

250
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,670
I just thought you might want
to see it one last time.

251
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,215
Gosh, Young-hoon.

252
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,509
You're more frightening than I am.

253
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,971
I didn't turn my back onÂ Jung-woo
when I was with him.

254
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:01,265
I betrayed him because he left me.

255
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:04,226
But you trampled all over Shin...

256
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,895
while standing right next to him!

257
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,189
You saw the notice.
Pack your things, and leave.

258
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,277
Seriously.

259
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:22,703
A hero? Give me a break.

260
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,580
He's a robot that kills people.

261
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,959
What will happen if this gets out?

262
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:37,217
Don't think aboutÂ saving your job
with that.

263
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:39,970
-What?
-How do you know

264
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,930
if that's Nam Shin 3
or the human Shin?

265
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,849
So-bong will say it was Shin.

266
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,434
Hey, you.

267
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:48,395
You don't care if Shin goes to jail?

268
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:51,857
You don't care if he becomes a murderer?

269
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,694
Do you think I did this
without expecting that?

270
00:19:57,154 --> 00:19:59,239
I started this expecting
to see it to the end.

271
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,205
Why don't you at least sit on the chair?

272
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:08,916
You worked for it all your life.

273
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,376
I should give you that much satisfaction.

274
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,799
You rat. I'll kill you!

275
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,094
You rat. Seriously.

276
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:24,473
I'll kill you. I will kill you all!

277
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,226
You... You little...

278
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,229
Hey. Let go.

279
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,940
Let go. Let go of me!

280
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,108
Why you...

281
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:38,403
Let go. I told you to let go of me!

282
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,245
Sir.

283
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,830
Please pull yourself together.

284
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,041
If you do this,

285
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,919
what am I supposed to do?

286
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,008
Hey! Why you...

287
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:08,183
He really is a robot.
He carried all of my friends,

288
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,018
but he didn't get exhausted at all.

289
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,522
That's right. What conglomerate heir would
risk his life to save others?

290
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,148
It was only possible because he's a robot.

291
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:17,526
How much does that robot cost?

292
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,569
I want one, too.

293
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,739
Forget men.
I want to live with a robot like that.

294
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,450
With the appearance of the AI robot,
Nam Shin 3,

295
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,203
PK Group's stock hasÂ reached
an all-time high,

296
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,747
and the group's
popularity is rising as well.

297
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:35,043
Everyone wants to know
the person who invented him.

298
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,922
You're the one who made me.

299
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,182
Everyone's talking about you.

300
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,353
Thanks for coming...

301
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,731
although I called out of the blue.

302
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,732
It's fine.

303
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:59,526
I wanted to tell you something as well.

304
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,363
I'm sorry for revealing myself
without asking you.

305
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,199
It's okay.

306
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,537
It was going to happen eventually.

307
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,832
Thank you for understanding.

308
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,128
I called you here...

309
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,757
because I have one last favor to ask.

310
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,801
I know it's wrong,

311
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,471
but I'll just come out and ask anyway.

312
00:22:29,556 --> 00:22:30,724
You and Shin...

313
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,977
can't live in the same place anymore.

314
00:22:35,687 --> 00:22:36,980
Can you go with David...

315
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,442
back to the Czech Republic?

316
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,616
I'm sorry, Mom.

317
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:51,119
The moment I said I was a robot,

318
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:53,038
the human Nam Shin was probably hurt.

319
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:57,626
I realized there are things
I had to protect...

320
00:22:58,627 --> 00:22:59,836
even if it hurts others.

321
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,384
I hope the human Nam Shin will
accept my image,

322
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,136
which you created for me.

323
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,765
That is the only way we can
accept each other...

324
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,725
and grow closer to each other.

325
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,945
I had...

326
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,952
installed a kill switch inside of you.

327
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:35,080
A kill switch?

328
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:37,290
That's right.

329
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,503
Once Shin woke up,

330
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,756
I was going to...

331
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,304
I'm sorry.

332
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,766
I was terrible.

333
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:57,936
It's okay.

334
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,106
You were trying to protect
the person precious to you.

335
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,360
I will do anything
to protect So-bong as well.

336
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,992
I'll go now.
So-bong's waiting outside.

337
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,830
She saved you.

338
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,041
She even risked her life to prevent me...

339
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,920
from activating the kill switch.

340
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,989
Did I cry without realizing it?

341
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,910
Seeing you didn't make me
this happy enough to cry.

342
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,828
I can hug you even if you don't cry.

343
00:24:56,912 --> 00:24:59,247
Sure. Yes, you can.

344
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,833
You can hug me a lot.

345
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,419
You can hug me over and over again.

346
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,219
Mom told me about the kill switch.

347
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:15,263
Are you okay?

348
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:18,225
Why did Dr. Oh...

349
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,770
Is that why she called you here?

350
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,814
I'm fine. You're with me.

351
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,693
Thank you for preventing her
from activating it.

352
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,238
It was nothing.

353
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,574
I'm glad as long as you weren't hurt.

354
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,037
My robot is all grown up.

355
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,581
Where's the kill switch?

356
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:43,500
With Dr. David.

357
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,638
So your mom told you.

358
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,141
It's going to its rightful owner,
so I feel better now.

359
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:03,895
This is your life, so guard it well,
my son.

360
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,606
Thank you, David.

361
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:11,486
Anyway, my son's famous now.
What do I do?

362
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,991
Given what it is, enjoy it.

363
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,951
Show everything you're capable of, too.

364
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,078
I'll see how far you develop.

365
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,082
I'll go now. Please take good care of Mom.

366
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,884
Tomorrow is the day he was made.

367
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,511
It's like his birthday.

368
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,306
Thank you for telling me.

369
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,939
Be born again, my son.

370
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,700
I called you out to have a drink.

371
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,535
You don't want to get drunk again?

372
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,163
It's still the afternoon.

373
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:05,999
I just don't get it.

374
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,211
Why did you do that to Mr. Nam?

375
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:12,589
You were so protective of him.

376
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:14,132
Why did you throw him away like that?

377
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,137
It was the only way to stop him.

378
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:23,308
I'll do anything to make him
come back to his senses.

379
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,436
I knew it.

380
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:31,316
I rather hoped you started
to have ambition.

381
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,236
Like normal people who seek success...

382
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,197
and get obsessed over titles.

383
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,744
Neither Shin norÂ I care about any of that.

384
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,456
He just thinks
the company was taken away...

385
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,458
because he's mad at the chairman.

386
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:52,629
Once he calms down...

387
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,215
and realizes what he truly wants,

388
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:56,966
I'll help him.

389
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:01,137
If he needs the company,
I'll give it to him.

390
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,100
I promised the other Shin, too.

391
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:08,728
Sure.

392
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,856
But I don't know
if he'll come back that easily.

393
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:14,818
Mr. Nam isn't at the house.

394
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,946
I think he's overexerting himself again.

395
00:28:21,741 --> 00:28:23,368
-Isn't that Nam Shin?
-He's here.

396
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,287
-It's him.
-Who are you? Nam Shin? Nam Shin 3?

397
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,664
Are you a human or a robot?

398
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,875
Do I look like a robot to you?
Are you blind?

399
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,711
Why are you here?
Do you resent the chairman?

400
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:35,004
Will you give us an interview
with Chairman Nam?

401
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,632
-Who are you?
-Let us see the chairman!

402
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,634
-Look this way!
-Please tell us!

403
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,302
-Why are you here?
-Please give us a statement.

404
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:42,220
Please look this way!

405
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:46,766
The identity of an AI robot
has been revealed.

406
00:28:57,026 --> 00:29:00,613
Finally, you, my masterpiece,

407
00:29:01,156 --> 00:29:02,657
are beginning to shine.

408
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,118
The world will respect me...

409
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,913
and realize
what a great feat I accomplished.

410
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,751
Now, you think I'm that jerk.

411
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,670
Why did you give
your shares to Young-hoon?

412
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,422
Was it intentional?

413
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,509
Mom, then Young-hoon.
Must you take everyone from me?

414
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,219
You can...

415
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,389
stop pretending to be Shin now.

416
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,977
I am Shin.

417
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,146
The real Shin.

418
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,231
Shin?

419
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,151
Watch out for him.

420
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:42,530
He may come to kill me someday.

421
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:47,619
He can't find out about the kill switch.

422
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:50,038
You'll be gone, too.

423
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:51,998
Kill switch?

424
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,375
What's that?

425
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,884
Do I have that, Grandfather?

426
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,303
Your mom made it.

427
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:09,766
To get rid of you
once the real Shin wakes up.

428
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,477
Mom made it?

429
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,647
Is there a way to get rid of that?

430
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,734
Is there really no way
to completely destroy it?

431
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:22,529
Shin. Stop teasing your mom.

432
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,324
There was a way...

433
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,869
to get rid of it.

434
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,458
Grandfather, who has it?

435
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,671
It's inside of your head.

436
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,048
It's nice and safe.

437
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,225
In my head?

438
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:55,311
Where is my "head"?

439
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,789
Ye-na. You have David's number, right?

440
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,375
Why do you ask?

441
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,419
Will you really destroy the robot?

442
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,087
Just do as I say.

443
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:23,631
No. What's wrong with you?

444
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:25,925
How far must you go?

445
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,803
I can't watch you destroy yourself.
Please stop...

446
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,605
You found it...

447
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,149
already.

448
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:45,862
THE ROBOT IS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD!

449
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,367
Nam Shin 3. Wake up!

450
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,675
You're not sensitive to humidity,

451
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,054
freeze if you go in water,

452
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,680
or anything like that, right?

453
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,935
My gosh.

454
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:28,154
Hey. They say this is
how celebrities come to spas.

455
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,408
But you really look like a celebrity.

456
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:33,868
Why did we come here?

457
00:32:34,869 --> 00:32:38,206
Because it's refreshing to be
in a hot room.

458
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,293
The temperature here is 42Â°C.

459
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,295
"Refreshing" is not the appropriate term.

460
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,216
People need to sweat for their skin...

461
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,593
to feel cool and refreshed. Okay?

462
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:52,887
You need to learn more about people.

463
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,014
That's why I brought you here.

464
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,853
But you really don't sweat.

465
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,568
But again, you probably don't pee either.

466
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,411
Your pulse andÂ blood pressure are spiking.

467
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:19,080
-You need to rest.
-Shall we?

468
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,749
Sure. It's hard to breathe
in here. Let's go.

469
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,377
It's hard to breathe. My gosh.

470
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,922
-Yours is yellow, and mine is blue.
-Okay.

471
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:30,174
Don't confuse them.

472
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,677
Did you try hard-boiled eggs?

473
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,762
-No.
-You eat that in places like this.

474
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:37,765
This is how you peel the shell.

475
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,852
Look at this. Peel it right off.

476
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:43,104
You see how easily it comes off? Try it.

477
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,606
Peel it like this...

478
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:51,446
My goodness. The egg...

479
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,239
was crushed.

480
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,078
I'm sure nothing will survive...

481
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,581
after hitting your head.

482
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:05,585
Gosh.
So I know you don't need to eat,

483
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,088
but just eat anyway.

484
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,091
You're supposed to eat this today.

485
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,010
It's a secret,

486
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:17,847
so don't ask or argue. Just eat it.

487
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,433
-Thank you.
-Sure.

488
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,311
It's delicious.

489
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,234
Do you really...

490
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,695
like my daughter?

491
00:34:33,821 --> 00:34:36,532
My number one rule is to protect So-bong.

492
00:34:39,285 --> 00:34:42,080
That's your way of saying
you like her, right?

493
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,585
Are you worried about her liking me?

494
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,253
That goes without saying.

495
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,964
I still wake up
in the middle of the night.

496
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:56,928
She does everything possible to get hurt.

497
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,805
That stupid child.

498
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:01,224
I'm sorry.

499
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,602
Sorry? Who knows how long it'll last?

500
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,189
How do you know
how solid her feelings are?

501
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:10,608
I don't know about her,
but I don't change.

502
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,443
I am predictable.

503
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:14,612
Don't be too sure.

504
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,990
You were modeled after a person,

505
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,451
and you keep developing even now.

506
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,246
Who says you can't become like a person?

507
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,624
People change,

508
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,252
and machines rust.
That's what time does.

509
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,923
So drop your stupid predictions,

510
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:38,094
and for just today... Just today,

511
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:41,681
like if you like, and hate if you hate.

512
00:35:42,181 --> 00:35:44,767
Like and hate to your heart's content.

513
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,729
That way, you won't regret it later.

514
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:55,319
Like and hate to your heart's content
to avoid regret.

515
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,452
I need to go somewhere.

516
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,457
We made it look identical, right?

517
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,334
Yes.

518
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,712
This is for So-bong.

519
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,173
She gave it to me
while saying it's her heart.

520
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:16,799
Well,

521
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,844
at least you know
how to return a woman's love.

522
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,096
Of course you should.

523
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:25,850
When I give her this, I'll learn...

524
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,853
what it is to like and hate
to my heart's content.

525
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,898
Your son is very warm.

526
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,443
He isn't my son.
Be careful what you say.

527
00:36:38,321 --> 00:36:40,364
He's my future son-in-law.

528
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,953
Future son-in-law.

529
00:36:49,248 --> 00:36:50,708
Must you go this far?

530
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:52,376
What if you get caught?

531
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,711
Shut it, and wait here.

532
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,422
I'll be right out, so plug in the address.

533
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,864
Who are you? What are you doing? Shin!

534
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:34,752
Shin!

535
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:40,466
So-bong went to get the cake...
I mean, the pastries.

536
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,761
What? Didn't you go toÂ the spa
with Mr. Kang?

537
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,972
I left something behind,
so I came to get it.

538
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,015
-You go first.
-That's right.

539
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,018
I'm Robocop. You're a robot.

540
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,145
We're brothers.

541
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,106
Include me, too.

542
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:57,608
I'll change my nickname
to Iron Man or something.

543
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,485
There's no room for you.

544
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:02,113
What do you mean?

545
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,156
-You should come soon, too.
-Okay.

546
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,644
THINK BEFORE PRACTICE
USE INSTINCT TO WIN

547
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,551
WARNING

548
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:09,388
Nam Shin 3, welcome home.

549
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:19,940
Nam Shin.

550
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:40,711
Let go!

551
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,473
-I'm going to Shin.
-No.

552
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,142
-That's what I've decided.
-Dad!

553
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:58,813
From now on, you can't see anything...

554
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:00,856
related to what I do or how.

555
00:40:01,816 --> 00:40:05,653
That's the last bit of kindness
I can show you.

556
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,916
They'll guard her so she can't escape.

557
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:20,668
Let's go.

558
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,805
MOM

559
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:44,191
Shin. Come over, and eat what I cooked.

560
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,777
I'll wait until you come.

561
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,737
POWER OFF

562
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,907
WARNING

563
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:25,441
Shin has the kill switch?

564
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:29,695
Yes. I think he's going to do something.

565
00:41:30,237 --> 00:41:31,739
We were going to a construction site,

566
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,616
but I was abducted.

567
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,076
Dr. Oh.

568
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,329
Please stop Shin.

569
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,000
Look into Ye-na's car's navigation system.

570
00:41:43,584 --> 00:41:44,543
Yes, sir.

571
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:12,238
What are you two doing?
Are you signaling each other?

572
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,116
Right?

573
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,994
You look nothing alike visually,

574
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,121
but you seem alike for some reason.

575
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:24,250
Don't say that.
You'll offend my Nam Shin 3.

576
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:27,127
Why that... I raised my daughter,

577
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:29,630
-but she's...
-Very useful.

578
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,424
Since So-bong is pretty,
cute, and lovable.

579
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:36,095
My gosh. Did you eat a stick of butter?

580
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,555
Why are you so greasy?

581
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,515
What's wrong with you?
Is this another error?

582
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,725
I promised to say what I want.

583
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,486
NAM SHIN

584
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,990
I'll call in 10 minutes.
You'd better be alone.

585
00:43:00,744 --> 00:43:03,414
What's taking the guys so long?
I'll go out and check.

586
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:12,047
Hurry up.

587
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:15,259
We almost couldn't have
the party because of you.

588
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,511
Why is it always my fault?

589
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,930
Give it here.

590
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,016
DINING
CAFE

591
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,144
I can't wait to eat.

592
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,397
What? When did you get here?

593
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,317
-You were just at the gym.
-I was?

594
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,861
Why did you get changed so soon?

595
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,196
You're a fashion robot.

596
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,867
-I'll see you upstairs.
-Okay.

597
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:42,745
I'm going to eat a ton of delicious food.

598
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,713
Did you go to the gym?

599
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:53,922
That's right.

600
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,091
Why did you leave this lying around?

601
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,509
Look across the street.

602
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,106
The kill switch.

603
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,609
Your heart. Your life.

604
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,323
You'll be dying today.
What should you do?

605
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,785
So-bong would be so hurt to see that.

606
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:25,996
-If you don't want to hurt her, come.
-Wait.

607
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,749
Give me a few minutes.

608
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,795
Fine. You should say goodbye.

609
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:35,089
Track me, and follow me.

610
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,063
The kill switch.

611
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,533
-Why isn't he coming?
-Wasn't he here?

612
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,326
-He was.
-We met him.

613
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:06,412
He went to get you guys.

614
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,956
-Must I wear this?
-Put it on.

615
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,624
You should wear one, too.

616
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,459
What's taking him so long?

617
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,294
Stop eating.

618
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,592
He ate all of this.

619
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:25,556
-Look.
-My gosh.

620
00:45:30,352 --> 00:45:32,104
Dad, come on.

621
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,653
Stop eating.

622
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,125
Eat up, okay?

623
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:28,076
MOM

624
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:35,417
The person you have
reached is not available.

625
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,836
Please leave a message...

TAXI
VACANT

627
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:56,021
What is it? Where are you
going without telling me?

628
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:01,610
Are you going to see Dr. Oh?

629
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:03,320
Since it's the day she made you?

630
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,410
Liar.

631
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,541
Just kidding.
I'm just sad that you're leaving now.

632
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,919
We were preparing a party for you.

633
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,213
You'll be back soon, right?

634
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:30,055
Put this on for me before you go.

635
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,473
I heard from Dad.

636
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:34,059
You can't just leave my gift and go.

637
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,644
You're so lame.

638
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,120
Let's stay together
for a very long time...

639
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:55,163
until the very end, okay?

640
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:00,961
I can't live without you now.

641
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,128
I love you,

642
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,547
So-bong.

643
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,107
He said he loves me.

644
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:06,860
He loves me.

645
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,163
We're almost there.

646
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,540
Is everything ready?

647
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,710
Yes, sir. If things go well,

648
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,004
you may be able to make a comeback.

649
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:38,392
SAFETY FIRST

650
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,126
MOM

651
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,016
You're not scared, is that it?

652
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:21,727
He's still acting all confident.

653
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:29,484
You made it.

654
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:33,405
Did you say your goodbyes?

655
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:35,073
Are you prepared?

656
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,245
Beg and plead.

657
00:50:41,413 --> 00:50:42,873
Who knows? I may change my mind.

658
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,791
You won't.

659
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,377
If you've decided to press it, do it.

660
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:48,879
Don't toy with me.

661
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,887
Who are you to tell me what to do?

662
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:58,889
I decide when to press it.

663
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:01,600
Put an end to your rage
with destroying me.

664
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:04,561
Stop destroying other people.

665
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:07,689
It all started with me,

666
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:09,816
so end it with me.

667
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:12,069
Press it.

668
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,280
Wait.

669
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,657
I'll end it soon.

670
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,206
No!

671
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,130
Shin, are you okay?

672
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,800
Why did you come here?
Please go.

673
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,009
No.

674
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:39,763
Don't do this.

675
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,557
-Please.
-Please go.

676
00:51:42,682 --> 00:51:44,267
Who knows what the human
Nam Shin will do?

677
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:47,896
You can get hurt, but I can't?

678
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,690
Stay still. Mom will handle this.

679
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,651
You can't get hurt.

680
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:55,403
It's the rule. I can't hurt humans.

681
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:58,782
I'm not a human.
I'm your mom, Shin.

682
00:52:00,951 --> 00:52:03,411
I need to step in to protect you both.

683
00:52:06,832 --> 00:52:07,666
Shin.

684
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,505
Let's talk.

685
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,508
I'll listen.

686
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:21,805
Wasn't hiding the kill switch enough?
Why did you come?

687
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,682
He did nothing wrong.

688
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,017
Take it out on me.

689
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:30,814
You...

690
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,193
lost your final chance
to get your real son back.

Are you okay?

695
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,283
Mom.

696
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:25,160
Please leave.

697
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:28,747
Shin.

698
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,082
Mom...

699
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,116
It's my birthday present.

700
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,995
I pray it works well.

701
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:11,957
Please.

702
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:14,751

I can see clearly.

But my body won't move.

It will soon.

I'll stay with you, so don't worry.

709
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,291
Mom.

710
00:56:20,377 --> 00:56:21,544
It's my fault...

711
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:28,802
It wasn't your fault.

712
00:56:31,471 --> 00:56:32,639
It was my fault.

713
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:35,892
I told you...

714
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:40,522
to go to the Czech Republic by yourself.

715
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,441
I'm so sorry.

716
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,445
I promised to go with you,

717
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:52,117
but I broke my promise.

00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,677
I was truly happy.

722
00:57:14,013 --> 00:57:16,141
I'm sorry I can't keep my promise...

723
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:19,727
to go back with you.

724
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:24,858
Tell Shin...

725
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,238
that I'm sorry...

726
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,825
for leaving him alone...

727
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,744
once again.

728
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:57,932
Mom.

729
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:01,019
Mom.

730
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,398
Mom, don't die.

731
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:31,216
Police?

732
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,469
A robot killed a person.

733
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:36,930
It's a killer robot.

734
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,146
Mom.

735
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:50,235
Mom.

736
00:58:58,326 --> 00:58:59,202
Mom.

737
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,055
I heard about Dr. Oh.

738
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:20,765
What? You think I did it?

739
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,892
Go take a trip.

740
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:24,435
I'm sure it was Dad.

741
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:25,853
Where's Shin?

742
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:29,732
Where is he?

743
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:33,236
Give me the chairman's shares
unless you want him dead.

744
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,823
I want to cry like a person.

745
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:40,577
11 hours and 12 minutes.
The kill switch was activated again.

746
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:47,166
