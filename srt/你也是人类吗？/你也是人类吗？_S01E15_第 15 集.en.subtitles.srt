1
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,031
Haven't you ever thought...

2
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:35,285
that the robot was better than humans?

3
00:00:36,619 --> 00:00:39,581
I shouldn't have hesitated back then.

4
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:43,168
Like you did today,

5
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,628
if you can't hold your temper
and get into fights...

6
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,089
or gamble and do drugs...

7
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,549
you won't pay for it.

8
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,886
Young-hoon will.

9
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,769
He's just angry.

10
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,605
I'm fine, Shin.

11
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,865
I know.

12
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,795
You punk. What are you doing?

13
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,171
I'm threatening you.

14
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,632
Just like you threatened us.

15
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,718
-What?
-You said Young-hoon is my stand-in.

16
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:34,969
Then why are you hitting him?

17
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:36,554
If you hit him, you're hitting me.

18
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,640
If you abuse him, you're abusing me.

19
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,350
You...

20
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:43,895
-Why are you doing this?
-Don't hit him again.

21
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,439
Don't touch poor Young-hoon!

22
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:50,819
If you do, I'll do much worse.

23
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:52,737
Do you understand?

24
00:01:58,827 --> 00:02:01,996
I know what you're really like.

25
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,884
Ice it. Don't make me feel bad.

26
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,262
Don't you make me feel bad.

27
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,353
You hurt your hand because of me.

28
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,583
Sorry, Shin.

29
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,335
Haven't you ever thought...

30
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,548
that the robot was better than humans?

31
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,259
This is how I should've responded.

32
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:57,594
I have not.

33
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,597
That question in itself is offensive.

34
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,433
If I'm this offended,
imagine how Shin must feel.

35
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,770
If you don't trust Shin,
I'll quit right now as well.

36
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:14,485
I shouldn't have hesitated
and taken your side.

37
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,448
Who told you that?

38
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,451
-The chairman?
-Yes.

39
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,995
He said he has known that I was a robot.

40
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,080
You can't know this.

41
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:31,669
If you do,

42
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,505
you'll be hurt beyond repair.

43
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,592
Grandfather...

44
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,029
I told you.

45
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,990
I checked, but that number isn't here.

46
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:04,786
I really think it's related
to this hospital.

47
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,413
Even if that person used to work here,

48
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,707
we wouldn't know
if they changed their number.

49
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,712
Is there a way to find out?

50
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,049
PK?

51
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:21,135
Is it...

52
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,680
about that?

53
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,224
About what?

54
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,019
I will compensate you generously.

55
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,521
This is something...

56
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:34,232
even the hospital director won't
talk about.

57
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,693
They silenced the media, too.

58
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,530
20 years ago, the heir of PK...

59
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,156
died in here.

60
00:04:43,574 --> 00:04:44,659
Suicide.

61
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:52,917
Excuse me.

62
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,087
Hey, Shin.

63
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,047
I have a favor to ask.

64
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:18,735
What are you doing here?

65
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:21,446
-Young-hoon wants to see you.
-He does?

66
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,448
Come with me.

67
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,259
-Where is he?
-He'll be here soon.

68
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,191
What are you doing?

69
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:42,026
Put it in your car. I'll be right back.

70
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,027
Hey!

71
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,322
Grandfather knew that he was a robot.

72
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,913
Still, this is wrong. Give me that.

73
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,331
What's wrong?

74
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,000
Why did that old man play along?

75
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,378
He cared more about
this jerk even if I died.

76
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,213
Why should I be treated that way?

77
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:06,217
I'm going to make it clear to him...

78
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,177
about what's real and what's fake.

79
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,055
I understand how you feel,
but this won't help.

80
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,182
Do as I say.

81
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,992
If you stop me now,
you're the same as Grandfather.

82
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:34,120
If you don't want me to misunderstand,

83
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,080
act like someone on my side.

84
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,903
It's so darn sad.

85
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,284
You said...

86
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,703
you'd never confuse us.

87
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,219
KANG SO-BONG

88
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,630
Are you that happy about fooling me?

89
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,174
He worked so hard pretending to be you.

90
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,010
Is this what you do
after barely beating death?

91
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,637
Yes, it is.

92
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:18,307
I didn't like him pretending to be me,
but after trying it out, it's fun.

93
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,935
-Should I continue?
-Keep trying all you want.

94
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,980
A jerk like you could
never compare to him.

95
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:24,897
Shut your mouth.

96
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:27,316
I'm real, and he's fake.

97
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,735
If you're rude to me,
I want to get rid of him.

98
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:30,987
Go ahead.

99
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,115
Real or not, I'll make you pay.

100
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,033
I've warned you.

101
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,564
-Hi, So-bong.
-Where are you?

102
00:10:07,189 --> 00:10:08,733
I'm in Young-hoon's car.

103
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,402
You scared me because you disappeared.

104
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,778
Why didn't you tell me?

105
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,655
Didn't the human Nam Shin tell you?

106
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,742
There was an error with MediCar,
so I'm heading back.

107
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,454
So-bong, it's me.

108
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,707
I'll take care of it and
send him home. Don't worry.

109
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,253
Must you go this far?
Why are you acting like a child?

110
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,546
That's good.

111
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,592
I'm a child, and you're an adult.
That means you can do everything for me.

112
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,022
That's ridiculous.

113
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,410
It's time for your meds.

114
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:03,579
Why is he like that?

115
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:11,796
Is it true?

116
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:14,548
That Chairman Nam...

117
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,051
knows about him?

118
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,763
-What?
-He says you know Chairman Nam.

119
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:24,058
No, right?

120
00:11:25,476 --> 00:11:26,560
The thing is...

121
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:30,856
How could you?

122
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,483
I'll explain.

123
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:34,068
Listen to me.

124
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:40,157
How... How could you do this to me?

125
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,576
How long have you been deceiving me?

126
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,537
I trusted...

127
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:48,290
this con man for over 20 years.

128
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,045
You were the only person
I could trust and depend on.

129
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,005
How could you do this to me?

130
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,258
How could you do this to us?

131
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,853
Let's step out for a minute.

132
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,414
I was shocked, too.

133
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,958
Imagine how she must feel.

134
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,878
It must be traumatic for her.

135
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,379
Please understand.

136
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:40,342
I don't think...

137
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,845
you should tell the chairman
that Shin knows.

138
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,347
I know that much.

139
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:49,852
I didn't take his money
because I agreed with him.

140
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,077
As expected, Grandfather is
one step ahead of you.

141
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,289
He completely fooled you
for over ten years.

142
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,334
Sorry,

143
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,587
but I'm not in the mood to listen to that.

144
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:20,758
I'll ask one question
and stop talking.

145
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:22,259
Is there...

146
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,017
a way to get rid of that?

147
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,604
-What?
-Why are you so shocked?

148
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,316
Is there really no way
to completely destroy it?

149
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,319
Shin. Stop teasing your mom.

150
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,905
I'll listen to your jokes later.

151
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,493
I never considered you close
enough to joke with.

152
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,163
If you can't destroy it,
switch it to manual mode.

153
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:54,166
I hear I can control it completely then.

154
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,794
We should show Grandfather...

155
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,338
that it's just a robot that can be
easily controlled.

156
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,340
Shin, please!

157
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,384
Why? You don't want to?

158
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,095
You said you'd do anything I ask.

159
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,764
If that's just a robot to you,

160
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,641
you shouldn't care what happens to it.

161
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,520
Do you care more about that too
like Grandfather does?

162
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,023
Or did you live with it for too long
to let it go?

163
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,067
That's enough.

164
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,325
I know we're partly resopnsible
for how you're acting right now.

165
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,202
We did it to protect you,

166
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,288
but it ended up hurting you.

167
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,249
If that's what will make you feel better,

168
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:36,584
go ahead.

169
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,711
But promise us one thing.

170
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,007
You will never hurt anyone else.

171
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:44,592
Okay?

172
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,093
Sure.

173
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,262
I promise.

174
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,439
Maibo.

175
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:00,941
Where's your big brother?

176
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:17,708
Hello?

177
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,376
Where are you?

178
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,713
When are you coming?
Are you still not done?

179
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:26,342
No. I don't think I can go home tonight.

180
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,637
Okay, then.

181
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:32,348
See you at the office tomorrow.

182
00:15:32,681 --> 00:15:33,682
Okay.

183
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,893
Turn around once before you go in.

184
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,061
What?

185
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:49,865
Maibo is poking me.

186
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,077
Sorry.

187
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,330
It's okay.

188
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:58,707
I'm a robot, so I don't feel pain.

189
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,671
This is why I like that you're a robot.

190
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:12,179
You should clean up when you're done.

191
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,722
They don't go there.

192
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,391
-Hey.
-Shin!

193
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,559
My gosh. Shin!

194
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:19,603
Did you run away
because we made you clean?

195
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,313
We thought you weren't coming back.

196
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,148
You don't even have anywhere to go.

197
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,402
Just live here with us, okay?

198
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,281
-Hey!
-Shin!

199
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,034
That hurts.

200
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,341
You must not let anyone touch this watch.

201
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,469
Okay.

202
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,971
Come back.

203
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:59,143
You're my toy now.

204
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,396
Go act like nothing happened.

205
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:08,986
Punk.

206
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,989
Are you showing off your
non-human strength?

207
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:15,826
Sorry.

208
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:17,661
It's okay.

209
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,914
What's wrong?
Did we do something wrong?

210
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,541
It's not that.

211
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,335
Are you okay?

212
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,838
I couldn't control my strength.

213
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,006
I'm sorry.

214
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,382
Don't worry about it.

215
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:32,676
They're used to being beat up.

216
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,761
Right?

217
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,512
-Yes.
-What?

218
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,473
I must go since I have to work tomorrow.

219
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,267
Can you go alone?
Do you want me to take you?

220
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,269
No. See you at the office tomorrow.

221
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,146
I'll see you.

222
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,655
What's wrong with that punk?

223
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,872
You're my toy now.

224
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,218
ACCESS DENIED

225
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,734
I experienced the manual mode
for the first time.

226
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,029
My body didn't move
according to my decisions.

227
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,865
You knew, didn't you?

228
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,200
Sorry.

229
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:22,202
I knew it was unfair,

230
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,871
but I didn't stop him.

231
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,581
I'm not here to criticize.

232
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,500
I need to know why Nam Shin did this.

233
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,589
He heard that the chairman...

234
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,008
knew the whole time.

235
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,095
He's taking out his anger
towards Grandfather at me.

236
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:45,100
What if he makes me do something
against my rules?

237
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,019
What if he hurts someone?

238
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,979
He promised he would never do that.

239
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,564
If he breaks that promise,
we'll stop the manual mode.

240
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,276
I'll make sure of it.

241
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,861
Don't worry.

242
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,656
I trust you, but I'm not sure
about the human Nam Shin.

243
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:02,784
Would he really keep his promise?

244
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,871
He will.

245
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,707
I believe Shin.

246
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,131
Shin, will doing this...

247
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,050
really help you?

248
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,762
I'll show them how dangerous a robot is.

249
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:23,847
You just wait and see.

250
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,682
Everyone will be shocked

251
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,851
It's still your face.

252
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,229
If he causes trouble,
it's bad for you, too.

253
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,147
Ignore everyone else,

254
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,983
and just show Grandfather
what you're capable of.

255
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,029
Are you lecturing me?

256
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,823
You seemed too obsessed with him.

257
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:46,536
I just wish you'd live your own life.

258
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,377
PK GROUP

259
00:21:08,725 --> 00:21:11,728
All of these are your servers.

260
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:17,234
For a human,
it's like walking into your brain.

261
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,820
Why are my servers
in the company building?

262
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,114
The company is like a baby.

263
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:24,574
It's always hungry.

264
00:21:24,825 --> 00:21:27,577
If you don't give it
more food than before,

265
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,830
it shrivels up soon.

266
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:35,335
I considered you as new food.

267
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,923
Something that could keep
this baby full for a while.

268
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:43,010
Is it like the AI item in Silicon Valley?

269
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:44,886
That's right.

270
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,889
All advanced corporations...

271
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,351
are interested
in merging AI and living things.

272
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,188
Thanks to the MediCar that you proposed,

273
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:59,735
my vague dream became clear.

274
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,822
Do you think an AI like me
could accomplish that?

275
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:05,824
That's exactly it.

276
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:11,496
An immortal city that is
completely controlled by AI.

277
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,626
M City.

278
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,212
That is my last dream.

279
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:21,298
Only you...

280
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,843
can make my dream come true.

281
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:37,522
Why are you coming from there?

282
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,192
-You said you were in the parking lot.
-I walked up.

283
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,235
Let's go up.

284
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,751
I saw you just yesterday,
but I'm so happy to see you.

285
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,379
What did you and the chairman talk about?

286
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,508
About work. He has
a last dream he wants to accomplish.

287
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:07,469
Why did he tell you
instead of his real grandson?

288
00:23:09,304 --> 00:23:10,180
Well,

289
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,266
I'd trust you much more
than that jerk, too.

290
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,104
Keep trying all you want.

291
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,607
A jerk like you could
never compare to him.

292
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,194
You need to pay,

293
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:26,363
So-bong.

294
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,121
MANUAL MODE

295
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,920
Are you insane? What are you doing?

296
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,133
Hey.

297
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,551
Hey!

298
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,845
What's wrong with you?

299
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,308
Hey, it's me. So-bong.

300
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,152
Why did you do that?
What's wrong?

301
00:24:47,444 --> 00:24:50,322
You did that last night, too.
You couldn't control...

302
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:00,248
What's that? That's not your watch.

303
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:01,958
Let me see.

304
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:05,629
-Why won't you let me see it?
-Stay away.

305
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,257
Don't come close to me. Please.

306
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,223
Something happened to you, right?

307
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,185
Is it because of that jerk?
He did something to you.

308
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,145
Don't ask anything, and stay away from me,

309
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,189
so I can't do anything to you.

310
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,824
He attacked you?

311
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,119
Yes. It looked like
he suddenly couldn't recognize me.

312
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:42,499
Something happened yesterday, right?
It wasn't a company matter, was it?

313
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:46,711
He was switched over to manual mode.

314
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,422
Who did that?

315
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:53,134
Did that jerk do it?

316
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,554
He promised not to hurt anyone.

317
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:57,889
I'm sorry.

318
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:00,684
-Are you hurt?
-Does that matter right now?

319
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,352
You know what he's like.

320
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,146
But he attacked someone.
Imagine how shocked he was.

321
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,065
He practically ran away!

322
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,735
Where's that jerk, Nam Shin?

323
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,613
Where is he hiding after
pulling this garbage?

324
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,115
I'll handle it.

325
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,285
I'll make sure this never
happens again, so calm down.

326
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:19,536
"Calm down"?

327
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,121
Are you protecting that jerk?

328
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:25,917
The person who protects a criminal
is worse than the criminal himself.

329
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:43,727
Sorry. It was an error.
I'm blameless.

330
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,688
That's ridiculous. You activated it.

331
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,565
I just wanted to scare her.

332
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,609
But he was more aggressive than I thought.

333
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,528
Let's talk in person. I'll come later.

334
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:05,832
Do you believe him?

335
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:09,753
An error? Give me a break.
I'm sure you want to trust your son,

336
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,130
but that's different
from actually believing him.

337
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,341
To be honest, you're nervous as well...

338
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:17,385
because you don't know
what your son may do to him.

339
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,180
Get out.
Get out of my sight.

340
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,727
Fine. I'll leave...

341
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,980
since I can never be forgiven.

342
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:33,568
But I wanted to give you money
to make Nam Shin 3.

343
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,529
I wasn't enough, so I received some help.

344
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,490
I found out later that
it was Chairman Nam.

345
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,619
He probably funded you for his gain,
but I didn't.

346
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,371
I really like Shin.

347
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:45,997
And I really like you, too,

348
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,666
a genius I can never catch up to.

349
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,878
I'm going to protect him
until the very end.

350
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,797
And if you want, I'll protect you, too.

351
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:00,887
Hello, So-bong.

352
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,765
He didn't come here.

353
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,976
I was worried, too. Please find him.

354
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,645
I'll look for him as well.

355
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,911
I heard from So-bong.

356
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,247
Where were you?

357
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,591
I have a favor to ask, Young-hoon.

358
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:55,316
Have a good meeting with Mr. Ji.

359
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,818
I'm going to run errands, too.

360
00:29:07,704 --> 00:29:08,997
It's Suh Ye-na.

361
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,666
Where's the chairman now?

362
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,514
Why did you call me here?

363
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,099
You know I'm not well.

364
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,153
What are you up to?

365
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,826
I didn't think you'd come
if I asked, so I asked him.

366
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,706
Are you his assistant?

367
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,126
I heard about what you did.

368
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,670
Let's talk later.

369
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,636
Don't run away.

370
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,017
"Run away"?

371
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:15,355
You run away. You're the fake.

372
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,898
I'm real, too.

373
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:18,817
Just like how you are real.

374
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:25,365
Then was it you who threw So-bong
against the wall?

375
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,201
How did that feel?

376
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,453
Did it break your heart?

377
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,414
Or did you want to die?

378
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:35,875
I'm sorry,

379
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,919
but that was just the beginning.

380
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:41,381
You'll do many things from now on...

381
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:42,882
like my slave.

382
00:31:20,545 --> 00:31:22,797
You humans resolve
your human problems.

383
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,674
Don't drag me into it.

384
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,887
You're angry because of your grandfather.

385
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,389
Then fight him directly.

386
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,892
Why are you using me to
torment people like a coward?

387
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,728
It's more fun playing with you
than fighting that old man.

388
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,648
True revenge is about
breaking what's precious to them.

389
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,484
Are you afraid of me?

390
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,154
-What?
-You're scared of me.

391
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,072
That's why you're trying to destroy me.

392
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,867
I will not compete against you.

393
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,244
I have no desire to take what is yours.

394
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,706
The house, family, and company are yours,
so relax, and go back to your place.

395
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,459
How dare you...

396
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,212
You're just a machine.

397
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:04,881
A doll that moves as I say.

398
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,467
If I tell you to kill So-bong,

399
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:10,428
you have to kill her.
That's what you are. Got that?

400
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,513
I do not want to hurt So-bong.

401
00:32:13,181 --> 00:32:15,183
I can't hurt anyone else either.

402
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,311
How can I get you to let me go?

403
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,104
What do you really want from me?

404
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,774
Disappear.

405
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,070
Do you know how disgusting
it is to see my own face?

406
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:29,697
Just disappear.

407
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,575
Get out of my face right this instant!

408
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,334
What are you doing?

409
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:43,294
Are you insane?

410
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,464
Back away.

411
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:53,054
I'd rather disappear...

412
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,806
than harm humans.

413
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,203
MANUAL MODE

414
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,209
Come down right now.

415
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,144
Do you get it now?

416
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,564
You don't even have
the right to disappear.

417
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,399
You're correct.

418
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,777
As you say,
I am nothing but a machine.

419
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,990
I guess what humans would feel
in this situation...

420
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,576
is the sense of helplessness, correct?

421
00:34:20,266 --> 00:34:21,768
You asked how I'd feel...

422
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,520
if someone who looked like me
suddenly appeared,

423
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,522
acted like me, and took my people.

424
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,275
I kind of pitied you back then.

425
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,235
But not anymore.

426
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,613
You deserve it.

427
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,950
Get him back to normal
while I'm being nice.

428
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,162
If you don't, I'll really kill you.

429
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,966
Why are you being so formal?

430
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,218
Have a sit.

431
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,427
No.

432
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,179
I don't want to stay long with you,

433
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,972
so I'll say what it is and go.

434
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,226
Shin found out...

435
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:06,979
that you knew about him
being replaced by the robot.

436
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:12,026
So that's why you're so upset.

437
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,029
It's for the best.

438
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:18,658
Shin had to find out eventually.

439
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,493
How could you say that?

440
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:21,786
He almost died.

441
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,246
He's your grandson.

442
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:25,748
I knew you were a frightening man,

443
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,627
but I thought you were doing it
all for Shin. However,

444
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,380
you're much more hideous than I thought.

445
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,174
How's Shin?

446
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,969
He's very impulsive, so I'm worried.

447
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,806
He's handling it just fine.

448
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,725
If you still care for him at all,

449
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,018
show it now.

450
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:48,980
It's your last chance
to get close with each other.

451
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,400
Mark my words. 

452
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,364
You're not surprised.

453
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,117
You know what's going on.

454
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,578
So? Do you think I'd tell you?

455
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,247
Of course, not.
You're my daughter after all.

456
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,919
I plan to tell the chairman everything.

457
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,421
Given what the robot is doing,

458
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,256
I have no choice.

459
00:36:58,925 --> 00:36:59,884
Dad.

460
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:09,101
The chairman knew everything,
but he played along.

461
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:13,689
Shin is angry about that,
so he's controlling the robot?

462
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,067
I told you everything I know,

463
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,860
so don't show that to Grandfather.

464
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,988
He already likes
the robot too much already.

465
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,615
He'll just hate Shin more.

466
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,367
Sure. You're right.

467
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,245
The chairman is so...

468
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,915
Shin has every right to be angry.

469
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,667
I am...

470
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,628
on the person's side, not the robot's.

471
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,547
Make sure to tell Shin that.

472
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,174
I don't trust you.

473
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,802
Let's live our separate lives.

474
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:16,919
Do you get it now?

475
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:20,298
You don't even have
the right to disappear.

476
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,091
You're correct.

477
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,720
As you say, I am nothing but a machine.

478
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,363
Let's terminate...

479
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,240
the manual mode.

480
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,202
-Why?
-Dr. Oh may not know, but I do.

481
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,079
There was no error.

482
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,458
Keep your promise. Stop it.

483
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,543
What you did to So-bong was enough.

484
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,711
No.

485
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,589
-Shin.
-You're making me want to do it more.

486
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,634
I had gotten soft for a moment there.
Thanks.

487
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,137
It's just about to get fun.

488
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:18,898
What is this?

489
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,567
Did you steal it from my office?

490
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:23,527
I went there...

491
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,613
and  found out that your father...

492
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,490
did not commit suicide.

493
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,243
That's why you acted weird
before you left...

494
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,079
for the Czech Republic...

495
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,664
-and that's why you went there.
-Don't try to find out.

496
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,876
Stay out of my business.

497
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,795
No, I need to.

498
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,339
I need to know what you're thinking.

499
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:45,591
Make me understand what you're doing,

500
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:48,677
or terminate the manual mode.
Choose one.

501
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,596
Why should I?

502
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,474
What if I won't do either of that?

503
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,480
This is my final warning.

504
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,733
Don't hurt people.

505
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:05,194
If you do that again,

506
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:09,323
I'll never see you ever again.

507
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,285
This is your first time.

508
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,457
You've never said that before.

509
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,391
SUH JONG-GIL

510
00:40:35,474 --> 00:40:37,726
I need to talk to you
regarding your father.

511
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,075
What are you doing?

512
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,086
Hello.

513
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,634
I'm sorry if I offended you.

514
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:14,221
We were friends for years
before I worked for him.

515
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,307
I missed him, so...

516
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,851
Why did you call me here?

517
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,896
What do you want to tell me
about my father?

518
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:26,025
You think I killed Jung-woo, don't you?

519
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,947
That may not be entirely wrong.

520
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:38,078
Since I sent him to the nursing home...

521
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,206
and made sure he couldn't leave...

522
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,834
as the chairman had ordered.
I did all that.

523
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:50,424
And he must've ordered you
to say he committed suicide.

524
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,553
You know that much already?

525
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,390
Jung-woo...

526
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,977
He fell while trying to escape...

527
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,313
to see you and Dr. Oh.

528
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,691
Your mother would die of shock
if she found out.

529
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:10,361
Why did you disguise it as suicide?

530
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:13,322
What were you
and Grandfather trying to hide?

531
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,867
I asked to see you
to tell you exactly that.

532
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,628
This is a recording...

533
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:29,838
of the chairman
and Jung-woo's conversation...

534
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:30,923
at the nursing home.

535
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,510
Why are you giving this to me?

536
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:38,722
I am afraid that you'll end up
like Jung-woo.

537
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:42,518
I know the chairman better than anyone.

538
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:45,980
He made Jung-woo and me
compete with one another,

539
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,733
and sadly, I'm the one that survived.

540
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:52,194
That robot...

541
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,738
captivated the chairman.

542
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,699
The moment he determines...

543
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,201
that the robot is more
beneficial to the company,

544
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,079
the chairman will get rid of you...

545
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,290
without a moment's hesitation.

546
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:06,500
Just like he did with Jung-woo.

547
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,462
Do not back off, sir.

548
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:14,133
I'm on the people's side.

549
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,152
Stop the whistleblowing.

550
00:43:33,777 --> 00:43:35,821
Then I'll let you out of here.

551
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,364
I will not.

552
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:39,992
I must let it be known that
your methods are wrong.

553
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,411
You're a loser that lost to Jong-gil.

554
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,663
You have no right to talk.

555
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,416
Even if I'm a loser, I'm still your son.

556
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,501
If you come after me,

557
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,338
I will make your son pay.

558
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,839
Father.

559
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:55,924
How could you say that?

560
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:59,345
My company is more
important to me than blood.

561
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:03,057
My company is my heart and my blood!

562
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:18,822
COLUMBARIUM

563
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:20,407
Mr. Nam Shin...

564
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,201
hasn't come out yet.

565
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,040
He must have a lot to think about.

566
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,958
So?

567
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,252
Do you think it'll go as you wish?

568
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,881
I did play my final cards after all.

569
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:37,716
We'll have to wait and see.

570
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:42,054
He will take out the chairman,

571
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:44,723
and I will take him out.

572
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,726
Then this disgusting fight
that I've devoted...

573
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,895
30 year of my life will finally be over.

574
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,948
Who is it?

575
00:45:15,003 --> 00:45:16,714
Do you know who I am?

576
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,175
Am I a robot or a human?

577
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,599
Only a human would ask that.

578
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,354
Someone desperate to confirm his identity.

579
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:37,192
The company is pretty
much your life, right?

580
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:39,903
Give me...

581
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,656
that company.

582
00:45:43,699 --> 00:45:44,950
All I can give you...

583
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,704
is one more chance.

584
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,458
The result is up to you.

585
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,418
Let me say this again.

586
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,504
Give me the company.

587
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:00,549
Don't give it to that robot.

588
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,218
My answer will be the same.

589
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,681
Shall I repeat what I said?

590
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,058
No.

591
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:11,894
That's enough.

592
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,188
Be smart about this.

593
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:16,356
Don't do...

594
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,526
anything stupid like your father.

595
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:20,105
The person you have reached
is not available.

596
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:38,665
YOU HAVE A NEW VOICE MESSAGE

597
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,168
VOICE MESSAGE INBOX

598
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:44,755
First message.

599
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,925
You're alone again, aren't you?

600
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,386
I told you not to be alone.

601
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:55,891
To be honest,

602
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:59,144
I was afraid of you yesterday.

603
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,564
I thought you were just like a person.

604
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,777
But for a moment,
you seemed like a real robot.

605
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,156
Is that why you're not coming?

606
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,158
Because I've thought of bad things?

607
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:16,328
I'm sorry,

608
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,580
so can't you forgive me this once?

609
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:21,625
I miss you.

610
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,795
I miss you like crazy.

611
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:36,098
I'm going to cry.

612
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:40,227
I'm going to cry until you come hug me,

613
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:43,313
so hurry up.

614
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,251
You were bad.

615
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:48,336
What took you so long?

616
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,679
What are you doing?

617
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,473
I'm crying.

618
00:51:58,907 --> 00:52:00,325
What's wrong with you?

619
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,537
Who are you?

620
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:06,873
No.

621
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,834
Don't do that.

622
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,526
Do you know who's following us?

623
00:52:39,656 --> 00:52:40,907
I don't know her.

624
00:52:41,074 --> 00:52:42,075
You really don't know her?

625
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,370
My memory data has been blocked...

626
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,747
except for you.

627
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:56,006
No.

628
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,720
No.

629
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:23,658
Call Jong-gil.

630
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:24,826
Yes, sir.

631
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,671
Did you want to see me, sir?

632
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:39,674
Did you...

633
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:41,968
meet with Shin?

634
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:44,512
Only at the office.

635
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:46,806
Don't try to lie to me. Tell me the truth.

636
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:49,100
Did you...

637
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:52,270
tell Shin anything or not?

638
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,190
Mr. Chairman.

639
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,692
Whether you talked or not,

640
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,445
if Shin finds out anything,

641
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,573
you're dead.

642
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,285
I need to silence you...

643
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,664
to clean up after me. Got that?

644
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:13,124
Of course, sir.

645
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,921
Mr. Nam.

646
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,600
MANUAL MODE

647
00:54:31,351 --> 00:54:33,228
That isn't Shin.

648
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,229
What are you doing?

649
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:17,981
Finish him.

650
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:29,159
So this is what she meant
by Shin controlling him.

651
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,120
Stop!

652
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:43,840
You're being used.
This isn't who you really are!

653
00:56:25,215 --> 00:56:26,299
I won't move.

654
00:56:27,258 --> 00:56:29,010
I won't avoid you.

655
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:35,392
I'm not scared.

656
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,478
I'm not scared of you one bit.

657
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:04,254
Please.

658
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:07,632
Come back.

659
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,551
Please.

660
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:25,066
-The rule is to hug you if you cry.
-The rule is to hug you if you cry.

661
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,486
What are you doing?

662
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,029
I'm not crying.

663
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,490
You want to cry.

664
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,117
I know.

665
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:38,413
Cry all you want, So-bong.

666
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,750
I won't tell you what to do anymore.

667
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,336
Whatever you choose,

668
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:47,589
I'll be on your side.

669
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,426
I'm going to cry.

670
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,429
I'm going to cry until you come hug me,

671
00:57:57,140 --> 00:57:58,141
so hurry up.

672
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:03,354
MANUAL MODE

673
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,158
ON

674
00:58:32,425 --> 00:58:33,384
I'm sorry...

675
00:58:35,553 --> 00:58:36,846
for finally hugging you now.

676
00:59:10,421 --> 00:59:12,632
This contract is about transferring
your shares to me.

677
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:14,008
Sign it.

678
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,134
Dad!

679
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:18,846
I thought you'd leave
once you knew he was on my side.

680
00:59:19,305 --> 00:59:22,475
Given the chairman's state,
I must stick to Mr. Nam.

681
00:59:22,684 --> 00:59:25,311
You're not detaching
yourself. Why should I?

682
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,981
Let's not be discouraged.
It's not a Shin to be a robot.

683
00:59:28,064 --> 00:59:30,775
If you truly care for me, get rid of him.

684
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:36,489
