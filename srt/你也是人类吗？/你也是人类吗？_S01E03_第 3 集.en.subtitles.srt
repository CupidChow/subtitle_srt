1
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:52,218
Of course, this is how my life will be.

00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,680
DFC
KANG SO-BONG

3
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,320
Yes!

4
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,699
Right, go!

5
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,034
Yes!

6
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:34,844
That's it!

7
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,730
Referee!
She hit her head!

8
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,190
Referee!

9
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,613
She poked her eyes!

10
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,115
You saw it!

11
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:58,785
-Stop.
-She poked her eyes!

12
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,913
She can't see.

13
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:04,541
Referee! Stop this round!

14
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,378
She can't see! Stop!

15
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,400
Don't throw it!

16
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,641
What's wrong?

17
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,810
-What?
-Let me go!

18
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,065
So-bong, please.

19
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,866
You fucking trash!

20
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,618
Fucking jerk!

21
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:53,483
DFC GANG SO-BONG BEATS UP
THE REFEREE, BANNED FOR LIFE

22
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,083
Why are you reading this?

23
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:13,670
They won't ban you. I won't let it happen.

24
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,506
They said it's all my fault.

25
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,842
They said the referee is not at fault.

26
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,136
They're all in the same gang!

27
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:24,555
All of them were bribed,

28
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,892
they manipulated the result.

29
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,769
I'll sue and make them kneel to you.

30
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,938
Stop it.

31
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,190
You know my fist.

32
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,277
I'll use my fist if the law doesn't--

33
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,820
I said stop, please!

34
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,031
So-bong.

35
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:44,367
What will you do with that?

36
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,661
It's weaker than a piece of paper.

37
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:50,498
Don't you see my broken leg?

38
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:54,043
My life is also broken!

39
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,337
I can't get in the ring anyway.

40
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,840
It's all over!

41
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:02,593
So-bong's life is over.

42
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:07,473
It's over anyway, let's just make money.

43
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,518
It was you.

44
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,812
You've been selling off all the pictures.

45
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,648
You totally got it wrong. I'm innocent.

46
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,442
If you're caught, completely deny it.

47
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,360
How dare you lie to me?

48
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,447
I just got sucked in.

49
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:27,493
What are you even doing?

50
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,204
You can't even save yourself.

51
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,749
Why do you stick your nose
in other people's business?

52
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,211
You look great.

53
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:38,838
You deserve to die.

54
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,594
But...

55
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,804
I can't die like this.

56
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,183
I'm scared, Dad.

57
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,367
Dad.

58
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,494
Bye.

59
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:21,274
Don't get it wrong. It's your heartbeat.

60
00:07:22,066 --> 00:07:24,485
I don't have a heart.

61
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:25,296
Shin.

62
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,424
Are you okay?

63
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:36,432
Where are we?

64
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,684
Why are you in my arms?

65
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,603
What?

66
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:50,404
Shin.

67
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,031
Shin.

68
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,580
Hello? Help!

69
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,374
Please help!

70
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,629
Mr. Nam is...

71
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:27,441
Don't let anyone touch his body.
I'll be there soon.

72
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,323
Shin!

73
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,034
What's wrong with my Shin?
Is he okay?

74
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,452
He's hurt!

75
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,969
Don't touch him.

76
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,304
What's wrong with you?

77
00:09:56,387 --> 00:09:57,513
I need to see his condition.

78
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,556
It's okay, don't.

79
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,100
Is it okay if he dies?

80
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,351
It's all on me.

81
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,858
Let's just get to the hospital fast.

82
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,242
What's wrong?

83
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,830
That crazy...

84
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,046
Hey, we have a patient here!

85
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:33,090
I'm sorry, there was a car coming in.

86
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,055
What is this?

87
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,515
I don't know, just stop them.

88
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,355
What are you doing?
You're taking the patient away.

89
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:49,148
I'll take all responsibility.

90
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,171
Can you fix him?

91
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,799
I'll get started. Please stop somewhere.

92
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:39,240
PK RECEPTION CATCHES FIRE,
NAM SHIN SAVES LIVES

93
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:42,076
He jumped into the fire?

94
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:42,993
Yes.

95
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,497
The news is referring to him as a hero.

96
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:50,835
They write the news like he's the reason
there's no casualties.

97
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,837
Hero, my foot.

98
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:58,467
That selfish and cold-blooded bastard
saves lives?

99
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,721
Is Ye-na alright?

100
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,182
Yes. She's being checking up.

101
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,899
-Who is it?
-It's from Czech.

102
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,945
He couldn't even complete his task.

103
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,823
-Take it.
-Yes, sir.

104
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,662
I saw him crushed by the truck.

105
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:29,582
How can he be in Seoul alive?

106
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,835
Why do you ask me that?
What's your point?

107
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:35,171
There's no single case filed
for that accident

108
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,173
with the police or hospital.

109
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:41,427
I've got the destination of the ambulance.

110
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,680
I'll call you if I have any leads.

111
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,563
It's raining.

112
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,609
You must be suffocated.

113
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,402
Let's get some air.

114
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,493
He really looked like
a different person.

115
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,622
Right after we were out,
he said, "Where are we?

116
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,665
Why are you in my arms?"

117
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,751
He did say that.

118
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,379
I know.

119
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:21,759
I'm thankful for my life,
but it is strange.

120
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,553
You also saw him carrying me out.

121
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:30,768
You again?

122
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:34,522
-Give me my phone.
-He saved you, he didn't carry you.

123
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:36,649
Why do you keep saying he carried you?

124
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:40,820
You must be repeating that part
in your head.

125
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,988
That wasn't my point.

126
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:47,785
Why? Are you saying he was weird
like someone else again?

127
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:52,331
Dad.

128
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,759
I was worried sick the whole way here.

129
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,387
I'm sorry, Dad.

130
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,473
Have you seen Shin?

131
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:12,309
He seems to be really hurt
but he hasn't come in.

132
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,727
Shin got hurt?

133
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,024
You must be worried.

134
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,402
-Please look for him.
-Okay.

135
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:23,904
I'll go with him.
I can't stay here any longer.

136
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:25,865
Sure.

137
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,665
He's gentle and warm.

138
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,793
She's lucky to have that kind of dad.

139
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:39,795
So-bong.

140
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,255
Are you okay?

141
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,965
Dad.

142
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:47,261
Why do you look this messy?

143
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:50,014
Did you go mine for gold?

144
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,809
Why didn't you just die there?

145
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:55,519
Why not?

146
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,605
Why do you hit me?

147
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:02,234
They took him
after blocking the ambulance?

148
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,737
Yes, it's my first time too.

149
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:08,490
They wouldn't let us touch him.
They took him in front of the hospital.

150
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,201
Where did they go?

151
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,330
His guardian said he'll take
full responsibility.

152
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,333
I have to go now.

153
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:22,838
Ye-na.

154
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,300
The car is ready. Go home first.

155
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:30,220
No, I'm nervous that something
might happen to him.

156
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,099
I need to protect you first before Shin.

157
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:37,186
Trust me and go and wait.

158
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,272
-Park.
-Yes, sir.

159
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,317
This way.

160
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:20,145
-Yes.
-Where are you?

161
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:21,939
Are you with Shin?

162
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,983
His back is injured, he's in surgery.

163
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:28,112
I heard something funny
from the ambulance driver. Where are you?

164
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:31,240
I'm at the hospital.
Once it's over I'll call you again.

165
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:35,160
The Chairman wants to go
see him right now.

166
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:38,122
Should I report to him what you did?

167
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,000
Which hospital is it?

168
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,462
It's PK hospital.
But--

169
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:50,384
Director Suh will go to the hospital soon.

170
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,320
There must be something.

171
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:13,282
We need to check now.

172
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:14,616
Go.

173
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:31,383
Is there any patient who got surgery
from the fire...

174
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,135
Oh, yes.

175
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,804
Okay, thank you.

176
00:17:37,598 --> 00:17:40,726
There hasn't been a single
emergency surgery.

177
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,897
I knew it.

178
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:48,734
Young-hoon. What are you planning?

179
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,445
Call the Chairman, right now.

180
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,578
Hello. He's in surgery.

181
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,455
Please wait here.

182
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:03,832
What are you doing?

183
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,375
You can't go in.

184
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,005
You just came out of there. Why not me?

185
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,009
It's Nam Shin's surgery.

186
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,761
How can you be this rude?

187
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,054
Park!

188
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,723
Please come out.

189
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,059
Get off me.

190
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:26,355
Let me go. You can't go in!
Let go!

191
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:03,767
What are you doing?

192
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,561
Excuse me.

193
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,521
Are you crazy?

194
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,195
You can't do that.

195
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:36,008
This isn't your playground.
Get out right now!

196
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:38,844
Please leave.

197
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,222
Okay.

198
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,486
I apologize for today.

199
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,406
I acted without thinking.

200
00:20:00,115 --> 00:20:04,578
But you were too suspicious.

201
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,997
Since you stole him
and changed hospitals

202
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:10,667
I thought something serious
had happened to Shin.

203
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:14,546
That doesn't mean you can barge
into the surgery room.

204
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,673
Right, I'm sorry.

205
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,592
I apologized already.

206
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,802
Keep your nose out of our business.

207
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:25,474
Or I will report today's incident
to Mr. Chairman.

208
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,550
Thank you, Yoon-joon.
You can go now.

209
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:01,843
What's all this about?

210
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,346
Who is she and why is Shin--

211
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,473
I'll explain later.

212
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:10,352
Please report that this surgery
was done by you.

213
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,438
Also please discharge him.

214
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,074
This wasn't planned.

215
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,705
I shouldn't have brought him here.

216
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,166
That crisis mode...
Why didn't you tell me?

217
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,961
He acted just like himself, robot.

218
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,797
I did delete the crisis mode
when I sent him here.

219
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,383
I need to know
why it didn't get deleted.

220
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:46,221
It's hard to have full visibility
over the new nerve network.

221
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,393
I'll move him to the recovery room.
Please get out carefully.

222
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:57,733
Please take a good care of him.

223
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:46,907
What a long day.
Do you know what happened?

224
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,536
I remember until the fire.

225
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,916
2 hours 38 minutes and 52 seconds.

226
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:57,918
Search the memory that was gone.

227
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:05,008
There was a fire at the club party
hosted by the PK Group.

228
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:09,304
There was a hero who jumped into the fire
to save people.

229
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:14,059
He's a hero who didn't lose
dignity saving lives.

230
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,103
Crisis mode.

231
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:19,272
I was like that.

232
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,235
It's my first time.

233
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:27,197
That was different from human Nam Shin.

234
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,160
I'm sorry, we almost got caught.

235
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,915
It's okay.

236
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,042
You saved lives.

237
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:41,795
It's just one of your functions.

238
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:44,297
Thanks to you,

239
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:47,426
Shin is a hero now. Don't be sorry.

240
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,594
I'm the hero.

241
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,473
I know that.

242
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,475
You're a hero.

243
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:07,279
There was a fire at the club party
hosted by the PK Group.

244
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:11,158
There were at least 100 people
in the building.

245
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:15,745
The police said it could be the fireworks
that caused the fire.

246
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,622
They will update with more evidence.

247
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,547
Excuse me. I'm here to look up a name.

248
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,841
He was totally different.

249
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:31,011
Right after we were out,
he said, "Where are we?

250
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,554
Why are you in my arms?"

251
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,930
He really said that.

252
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:39,644
The fire swallowed the entire building
but thanks to the hero

253
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:42,981
there were no casualties.

254
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,692
Nam Shin wouldn't do that.

255
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,403
Never.

256
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,782
It's that jerk Shin?

257
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,242
You took the wrong one?

258
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:57,037
The focus is out. I was in a hurry.

259
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:01,082
It's almost like he changes his mode

260
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,376
and jumps into the fire.

261
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,587
Then doesn't remember.

262
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,508
Something smells fishy.

263
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,135
He has this arrogant character.
There must be something.

264
00:25:12,427 --> 00:25:14,721
Memory loss? Early dementia?

265
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:17,224
What could it be?

266
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,642
Oh, I want to know.

267
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,560
I'm dying to know.

268
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,437
I want to know, too.

269
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,657
The director of PK Group, Suh Jong-gil.

270
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,535
He's the father of Nam Shin's fiancée.

271
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:41,957
My daughter said something odd.
I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation.

272
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:47,629
Could you explain what happened
between you and Shin?

273
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:35,547
I saw another person
tailing human Nam Shin.

274
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,386
He is here.

275
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:43,471
Who is he?

276
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,891
That's not important, the important point
is that he found us here.

277
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:51,146
He'll come back again
and he'll see your son.

278
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,899
Let's talk more in person.

279
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:58,653
-In person?
-I'm coming to Korea with your son.

280
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:01,197
What?

281
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,458
This is as far as you can go.

282
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:12,959
-Restroom.
-That way.

283
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,968
Can you please explain in detail
what happened?

284
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,346
He threw away my shoe and said,

285
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,975
"Hurting your ankle won't kill you.
Save yourself."

286
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:32,187
Is he really from the PK Group family?

287
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,356
He has the look, the body and the wealth.

288
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,983
He's an unrealistic character.

289
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:41,196
-He's the perfect hero.
-Iron man, Batman and Kingsmen.

290
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,906
Money maketh man.

291
00:29:45,825 --> 00:29:49,454
They said I'm the hero.
The unrealistic character.

292
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:08,640
It better be you who gets hurt next time.

293
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:14,729
If you forget again that Shin comes first
and Shin's business is your priority.

294
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:19,150
It won't end like today again.

295
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,276
Yes, sir.

296
00:30:20,401 --> 00:30:23,363
The press is waiting. Let's go out.

297
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:25,323
Why do we need the press?

298
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,785
It's good for you
if he has a positive public image.

299
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:32,747
We need to maximize his hero image
that's spreading through social media.

300
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,208
Let's go, Chairman.

301
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:53,268
Does it hurt a lot?

302
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,103
It happens all the time.
Don't worry about it.

303
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,273
I'll get hit for you.

304
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,525
I don't feel pain.

305
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,195
That's not helping. I'm your assistant.

306
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,364
Let's get going.

307
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,417
There he is.

308
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,923
Weren't you scared in the fire?

309
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:25,800
How do you like it to be called a hero?

310
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,760
Did you do that
to save the company's image?

311
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,262
Do you feel your popularity?

312
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,680
Wait.

313
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,140
Are you feeling better?

314
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,474
Dear Shin!

315
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,189
Do you remember us?

316
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,941
We'd all be dead without you.

317
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:45,945
Can you say that again what you said
when you threw my shoe away?

318
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,449
"Hurting an ankle won't kill you.
Save yourself."

319
00:31:49,532 --> 00:31:51,200
So sexy.

320
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,036
Will you go out with me?

321
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,329
I don't have a boyfriend.

322
00:31:55,038 --> 00:31:56,080
That's a lie.

323
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,625
Can we take a picture together?

324
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,420
Nam Shin.

325
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:27,987
I know it's childish,
but I want to say something.

326
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:32,075
Thanks for saving me and my Dad.

327
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:36,663
If something had happened to me,
I'm not sure what Dad would've done.

328
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:41,501
I want to show you my appreciation.

329
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:43,586
Let me work for you.

330
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,007
Please accept me as your personal guard.

331
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:56,683
Stop making scenes and leave.

332
00:32:56,766 --> 00:33:00,103
I don't need the money.
Please accept me.

333
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:02,897
Kang So-bong.

334
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,816
Don't do it here, let's--

335
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:09,404
Didn't you promise
that you would rehire her?

336
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:16,327
You used So-bong
for your hidden camera show.

337
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,122
Then you just fired her.

338
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:21,582
Hidden camera show?

339
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,167
What is that?

340
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:26,045
Didn't you apologize for that?

341
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,339
And promised that you'll hire her?

342
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,716
Ms. Jo...

343
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,884
What do you mean the hidden camera show?

344
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,845
Is So-bong a scapegoat?

345
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,471
Please say something.

346
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,974
-Please explain.
-Please tell us.

347
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,268
I don't care about the past.

348
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:48,526
Whether he asked me or not,
I was the one who was tempted.

349
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:53,239
And he accepted me again
so I'm here to thank him.

350
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,285
I'll protect you wherever and whenever.

351
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,162
Please...

352
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:01,789
take me back.

353
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,322
Thank you for accepting me again.

354
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,367
I'll bet my life to protect you.

355
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,122
She's lying.

356
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:51,714
He asked you to take that picture?

357
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:57,345
He has a lot of secrets.

358
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:04,185
People say he looks different
or he has changed.

359
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,774
Where are we?

360
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,818
Why are you in my arms?

361
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:13,319
What?

362
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,662
I need more solid evidence.

363
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:25,706
By any chance...

364
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,876
would you help me?

365
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,753
I can pay as much as you ask.

366
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:33,131
As much as we ask?

367
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:36,634
We have to give her money.

368
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:40,054
Before the rumor
about his hidden camera show spreads.

369
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,806
We need to shut her up.

370
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,267
We don't need her as his personal guard. 

371
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:48,020
I will rebuild his image that went down
from his violent act at the airport.

372
00:35:48,354 --> 00:35:53,734
He let the woman take his picture
and he hit her in front of people.

373
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:57,530
Are we that afraid of the rumor
to hire her as his personal guard?

374
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:59,282
It's just temporary.

375
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:08,624
Why are you so sensitive?
This is for his image rebuild.

376
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:14,130
Is there any reason she shouldn't
be together with him?

377
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,889
It's high risk.

378
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,933
I don't like it either. I just don't.

379
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,856
I want to hear your opinion
not as his fiancée,

380
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,984
but as the PR director.

381
00:36:36,277 --> 00:36:40,573
What do you think is the best
for Shin and the company?

382
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,830
CHAIRMAN'S OFFICE

383
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,801
I guess a woman in tears
is your weak point.

384
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,888
Just like your presentation day
and just earlier...

385
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,681
you hug because I cried, right?

386
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,058
Not for being a woman.

387
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,685
What? I'm a woman.

388
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,438
I hug animals and humans if they cry.

389
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:18,027
Thanks anyways for accepting me
no matter if I'm an animal or human.

390
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:19,820
Then why did you lie?

391
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,907
You said you'll bet your life.
That's a lie.

392
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:27,703
It's not a lie. My dad told me
to bet my life to be loyal to anyone.

393
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:31,499
I bet my Dad on this. I promise.

394
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,671
It's a lie again.

395
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:37,713
I'm not...

396
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:40,341
I'm not lying.

397
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:53,771
The chairman gave you a month.

398
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,774
-When can you start?
-Right now.

399
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,193
I can start at this moment.

400
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,782
Thank you.

401
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,201
Thank you, Chairman.

402
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,264
Take the call, it's fine.

403
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,559
Excuse me.

404
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,356
Hi Dad.

405
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,984
Where the heck are you right now?

406
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:42,611
Who said you could be discharged?

407
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,283
I'm working for that job again
as you wished so hard.

408
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:52,580
I'll work as hard as I can
just like you taught me. Please take care.

409
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:55,333
What the heck are you talking about?

410
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,753
What job are you talking about this time?

411
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,589
You deserve more beating.
Come back now!

412
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,342
Sure, Dad, I love you too.

413
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,760
Sure.

414
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,682
I'm sorry. My dad is worried about me.

415
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:15,686
-A lie.
-I'm not.

416
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,396
You're not what?

417
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,524
I'm sorry. It's nothing.

418
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,280
We're here. Please stop at the gate.

419
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,531
Yes, sir.

420
00:40:06,112 --> 00:40:08,114
The chairman is in the garden.

421
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:11,033
He asked the personal guard to stay
in the guest room.

422
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,159
Let's go in.

423
00:40:26,757 --> 00:40:28,592
Your room is in there.

424
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,386
Please don't go upstairs.

425
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,720
Also not the main building.

426
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,223
-Okay.
-You can go.

427
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,533
This got a bit bigger.

428
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,995
She'll be with you 24 hours.
So be more careful.

429
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,289
We'll find out her motive.

430
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,016
You surprised me.

431
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,853
You promised you won't
call any time. What's up?

432
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:24,273
I'm regretting that I let you go there.

433
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:28,777
I feel like I just threw you there
as a snack into the tiger cage.

434
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,490
You're not even a small snack.

435
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,159
Come out now.

436
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:38,621
You have to be alive to spend the money.

437
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,831
Just come out.

438
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:42,166
Are you crazy?

439
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,502
I can't leave already.

440
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,338
I'll catch a tiger in the tiger cage.

441
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:51,509
-Bye.
-It's too dangerous!

442
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:17,261
He really looks like Shin.

443
00:43:18,846 --> 00:43:21,056
You like figures just like Shin.

444
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,268
The human Nam Shin must like robots.

445
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,065
Would he like me too when he wakes up?

446
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,701
This is his phone.
Use it only it's necessary.

447
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:45,080
This house is connected through IoT.

448
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:04,892
Yes, Chairman.

449
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,644
Yes.

450
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:08,354
Sure.

451
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,232
The chairman called you.

452
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,151
As practiced, 

453
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:15,861
act like Shin.

454
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:15,212
Is this how you pay me back
for raising you?

455
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,133
How can you leave without telling me?

456
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,344
You thought I'd just sit and watch you?

457
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,555
I'm not that easy.

458
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:25,764
Chairman.

459
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:29,893
Where's is it? Where's your scar?

460
00:45:29,977 --> 00:45:31,311
I don't have a scar.

461
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,021
Shin doesn't have a scar, right?

462
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,947
You're not him. You can't be him.

463
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:44,742
Who are you?

464
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,994
Who are you to pretend to be like him?

465
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:49,955
Dad, why are you doing this again?

466
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:52,249
The scar is on Jung-woo. Not him.

467
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:54,293
Jung-woo is dead.

468
00:45:54,376 --> 00:45:56,003
It's Jung-woo's son, Shin!

469
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,299
Jung-woo.

470
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:02,634
Jung-woo.

471
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,346
You bad son. You're the cold-blooded son.

472
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,681
Let's get him inside.

473
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:12,686
Get yourself together, Dad.
If anyone finds out, we're done.

474
00:46:13,479 --> 00:46:16,815
You're the cause of this.

475
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:17,858
You should know it!

476
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:19,359
Please go inside.

477
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:52,429
Hello,

478
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,639
friend?

479
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:27,983
Let's go, friend.

480
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:58,180
How were you doing?

481
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,140
Is everything working okay?

482
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,021
What do you think?

483
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:08,732
Do you like humans?

484
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,114
I'm sorry. It was a hard question.

485
00:51:20,202 --> 00:51:21,620
I like you, too.

486
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:37,052
What's up with this house?
Is it like a ghost house?

487
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,392
Tomorrow?

488
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:47,187
Okay.

489
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,564
I'll see you at PK hospital at 11.

490
00:51:50,482 --> 00:51:53,735
Don't worry about anything else.
Just prepare to see Shin.

491
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:00,283
I hope Shin recovers soon.

492
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,993
He'll wake up soon.

493
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:05,038
I'll do whatever to make it so.

494
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,848
I finally did it.

495
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:26,268
You better be careful, I'm watching you.

496
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:51,626
Dad: Where are you?
You better come back now!

497
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,402
He didn't sleep at all?

498
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:20,864
What is he looking at?

499
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:25,327
Oh, a porno?

500
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,990
Why are you here?

501
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:08,703
Asking to be his personal guard
was too much for just being thankful.

502
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,508
It looks good. Why don't you eat it?

503
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:27,264
Wow, where do you get this kind of bread?

504
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,515
Hotel bakery?

505
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,684
I'll get suspicious
if you avoid my question.

506
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,560
You're already suspicious of me.

507
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,523
I lied about that I don't need the salary.

508
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:40,735
The salary of a bodyguard isn't high.
But here, you get the top in the market.

509
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:46,324
But I meant it when I said I was thankful.
I'll bet my life to serve Mr. Nam.

510
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:49,411
Just make sure I get
well paid even for the overtime.

511
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:52,872
You're much more brazen than I thought.

512
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,627
It's our day off, are you going somewhere?
Should I get prepared?

513
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:00,714
It's my personal schedule.
Since Mr. Nam will take a break--

514
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:02,382
His break is over, I guess.

515
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:24,988
I'll be back soon. Watch out for her.

516
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,115
Are you going to meet Mom?

517
00:55:29,951 --> 00:55:31,494
It's about work.

518
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:33,163
I'll let you meet her soon.

519
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:49,137
Yes.

520
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,848
I'll see you at PK hostpital at 11.

521
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:56,853
Don't worry about anything else.
Just get prepared to meet Shin.

522
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:07,447
Mr. Suh. It's So-bong.

523
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:14,913
Yes.

524
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,915
Hello, it's me.

525
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:18,666
Something is strange.

526
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:22,295
Mr. Ji is meeting someone alone
who seems to be here to meet Shin.

527
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,049
You don't know who he is meeting?

528
00:56:26,841 --> 00:56:30,303
No, he just said not to worry anything
else but be prepared to meet Shin.

529
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,679
I heard it just like that.

530
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:37,894
I'm sorry to ask you this,
but can you tail him?

531
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:54,577
I'm sorry, but my son's face is messed up
from the accident.

532
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:57,247
No worries.

533
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:59,332
-I'll help you.
-It's okay.

534
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:03,753
Please be careful with the driving.
He's afraid in cars.

535
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,881
Don't worry. I'll drive slowly.

536
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:49,090
Why do you want the VIP room
all of sudden?

537
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,135
What is he?

538
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:57,098
Who is this person, Jo Min-jae?

539
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:00,602
It's Nam Shin.

540
00:58:00,977 --> 00:58:01,853
What?

541
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:04,689
Why is he here?

542
00:58:05,565 --> 00:58:06,983
He's well and discharged.

543
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,531
Are you asking me to forfeit
the patient information?

544
00:58:15,617 --> 00:58:16,493
No.

545
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:19,996
I'm a doctor.

546
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,208
Even if it's your boss that
you serve with your life, I can't.

547
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,334
Hyun-joon.

548
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:27,420
Please do this for me,
pretend you don't know anything.

549
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,506
I beg you.

550
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:32,842
I'll be clear. I can't--
No, I won't.

551
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:35,386
It's related to that incident, right?

552
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,389
I knew it when you asked me
for the fake surgery record.

553
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,558
Is it about her with you?

554
00:58:40,975 --> 00:58:42,685
Who is that woman?

555
00:58:47,398 --> 00:58:48,525
I'm Shin's mom.

556
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:52,820
I'm the mom for both
this Shin, and the other Shin you saw.

557
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:57,408
How did you come here?
You didn't go to Shin?

558
00:58:57,492 --> 00:59:00,078
It won't be easy to persuade
a doctor, so I'm here to help.

559
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,581
Who are you to persuade me?

560
00:59:04,165 --> 00:59:07,502
Sorry, I don't persuade anyone.

561
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:10,588
The moment you signed
the fake surgery record

562
00:59:10,672 --> 00:59:12,674
you had no choice anymore.

563
00:59:14,342 --> 00:59:16,678
You can call it a threat, I don't care.

564
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:19,931
I can do worse for my son.

565
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:37,991
EMERGENCY CENTER

566
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,518
I guess he was too shocked.

567
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,562
I'm sure he needs time.

568
01:00:09,355 --> 01:00:10,690
Let's wait for him to ask.

569
01:00:14,277 --> 01:00:15,320
It's David.

570
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:16,571
Hello?

571
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:20,783
Darling, don't die from missing me.
I'll be there soon.

572
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:25,580
My son is on his way smoothly
thanks to the driver.

573
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,375
Please be careful.

574
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:31,502
Okay.

575
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:46,392
Okay.

576
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:06,371
Take him to the VIP room,
I'll get prepared.

577
01:01:09,374 --> 01:01:10,458
Thank you, Hyun-joon.

578
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,920
I'm doing this for him.

579
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:17,382
The moment I signed the fake record,
I was prepared to quit.

580
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,259
So don't threaten me with that again.

581
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:35,900
You must be a great person.
You have a good friend.

582
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,655
Let's go.

583
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,485
Time to collect some money.

584
01:02:19,944 --> 01:02:22,029
GOLD MINE

585
01:03:30,264 --> 01:03:32,809
You said you installed the camera.
Please look through it.

586
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,645
Mr. Nam!

587
01:03:35,728 --> 01:03:37,063
I was so worried!

588
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:39,649
You're not lying now.

589
01:03:40,900 --> 01:03:42,360
Please act like Shin.

590
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,987
What? I don't look like Shin?

591
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,324
There are really two Nam Shin.

592
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:50,576
Can you make the test drive successful?

593
01:03:50,660 --> 01:03:52,578
I will, then give me your company for it.

594
01:03:52,662 --> 01:03:54,038
What's wrong with that car?

595
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:55,373
Mr. Nam!

596
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:01,337
