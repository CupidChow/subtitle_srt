1
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,370
Back then, I thought it was a dream.

2
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,789
A dream of seeing myself.

3
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,255
Shin.

4
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:49,090
It's Mom. Shin. Wake up.

5
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,843
How is Shin doing?

6
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,763
If Mr. Suh were to find out...

7
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,683
Shin must stop him.

8
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,061
He has to go back.

9
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,730
Young-hoon.

10
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,899
I'm right here.

11
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,985
Shin. Go to Seoul,

12
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:11,154
and protect Shin's position.

13
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,157
I'll do as you say.

14
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,160
So don't be sad.

15
00:01:17,577 --> 00:01:19,204
He'll take my place?

16
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,039
That's ridiculous.

17
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,000
But...

18
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,294
this is a robot?

19
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,298
Even if he looks like me,
he'll be caught right away.

20
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:32,801
Because in the end,

21
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,929
he will be different from me.

22
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,265
Try acting like me all you want.

23
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:43,186
Once I wake up,

24
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:45,688
it'll all be over.

25
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,625
The kill switch. I overheard.

26
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,087
To him, that's like death.

27
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,464
If you're really his mom,

28
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:55,592
please get rid of that horrible device.

29
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,642
-What is it?
-Dr. Oh.

30
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,895
Shin's finger moved.

31
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,190
His finger moved? What do you...

32
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,568
Your son, Shin! He's moving now!

33
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,168
What are you staring at?

34
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:32,837
People.

35
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,215
I'm trying to understand them more.

36
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,842
You're surrounded by such terrible people.

37
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,136
Aren't you sick of people?

38
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,763
I want to understand you more.

39
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,264
What?

40
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,770
I need to know more about you, So-bong.

41
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:54,817
You need to know more about me?
What do you mean?

42
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,695
If I watch human facial expressions,

43
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,031
I'll be able to read yours better.

44
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,284
But I don't know
what your expression earlier means.

45
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,953
What were you thinking?

46
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:06,746
Just now?

47
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,044
Lies don't work on you anyway.

48
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,341
For a moment,

49
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:21,761
I wished you weren't a robot.

50
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:22,971
Why?

51
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:24,722
I'm a robot.

52
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,475
I know that.

53
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,686
If not a robot, what should I be?

54
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,064
Forget it. Get up.
I need to go home.

55
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,736
Shin!

56
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,657
Shin.

57
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:47,745
Why...

58
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,248
Why... Why isn't he moving?

59
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:52,750
Look at this.

60
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,678
His finger... His finger really moved.

61
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:07,015
His pupils are responding,
and his gag reflex is back.

62
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,267
He moved his hand voluntarily too.

63
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:12,729
He'll be able to wake up
and express himself soon.

64
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,605
This is real, right?

65
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:17,150
It isn't a dream, right?

66
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,570
I was so afraid something
would happen to you.

67
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,949
Thank you for waking up.

68
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,577
Thank you, Shin.

69
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:31,080
Thank you for waking up.
Thank you.

70
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,008
I still can't believe it.

71
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,511
-I need to go back.
-Sit back down.

72
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,597
You weren't the only one, we all saw it.

73
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,349
Please calm down.

74
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:01,569
He can't know any of this.

75
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,571
He would be just happy even if he knew.

76
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:06,407
No, So-bong can't find out.

77
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,787
She returned as his bodyguard.

78
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,873
And she asked me
to remove the kill switch.

79
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,292
She knows about the kill switch?

80
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,420
Yes. They seem closer than I thought.

81
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,633
If she finds out,
she'll tell him about the kill switch.

82
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,009
Why?

83
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,054
Can't he know?

84
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,932
He has the right to know
that cruel thing is in him.

85
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,309
Didn't you see him decide
and act on his own?

86
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:36,687
What if he finds out
and refuses to activate it?

87
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:39,982
If he remains near the real Shin
after he wakes up,

88
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,734
it can get very dangerous.

89
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,486
It hasn't even happened yet.

90
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,988
And what? The "real" Shin?

91
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:48,241
Is he a fake to you then?

92
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:49,992
Doesn't he matter at all?

93
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,454
There's only one real Shin anyway.

94
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:56,707
You really...

95
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:01,754
Shin's recovery is our top priority
right now,

96
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,798
so let's not say anything.

97
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:07,760
We still need them until Shin is
fully recovered anyway.

98
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,347
You're all insane.

99
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,808
Sure, this was insanity from the start.

100
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:17,812
Insane or not, don't tell either of them.

101
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:27,447
CHAMPION GYM

102
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,584
Bye. See you tomorrow.

103
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:48,718
-Why are you coming in?
-I should say hi.

104
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,052
I'm close with your dad.

105
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,346
He even slept on my lap last time.

106
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,016
Don't even think
about seeing my dad for a while.

107
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,851
Nothing good will come of it.

108
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,187
Bye.

109
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:14,660
Why would nothing good
come of seeing me?

110
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,538
What did you do wrong?

111
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,415
Why?

112
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,419
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

113
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:27,924
Don't you want any?

114
00:08:28,424 --> 00:08:29,842
I don't drink much.

115
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,969
Yes, I'm sure.

116
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,931
You wouldn't like coffee
in a hick town like this.

117
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,394
Anyway,

118
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,357
I heard you called off
the wedding. Is that true?

119
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,983
Yes.

120
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,777
I ran out of the wedding.

121
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,404
My gosh. How do you say that...

122
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:52,240
like it's no big deal?

123
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,575
My gosh.

124
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:58,955
I saw So-bong was wearing her suit.

125
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,082
You didn't hire her, did you?

126
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,334
I did. She returned to work today.

127
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,962
She said she quit and left. Why?

128
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,339
Did you call her back?

129
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,132
Yes.

130
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,635
I can't trust anyone like I trust So-bong.

131
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:16,305
So-bong?

132
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:20,643
Why are you saying her name so casually
like that? Are you friends or something?

133
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,811
Yes, we're friends.

134
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:23,271
Very special friends.

135
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,941
You just called off your wedding.

136
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,402
Why are you friends? It's unsettling.

137
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,321
She used being friends as an excuse. See?

138
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,449
Yes. She isn't a woman in his eyes.

139
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,410
That's how he can be friends.

140
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,663
Hey. Why you little...

141
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,456
-Just sip on your drinks.
-Okay.

142
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,591
Let me ask you something.

143
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:53,509
Do you...

144
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,971
not see So-bong as a woman?

145
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,348
Naturally, I see her as a woman.

146
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:00,891
Her gender is female.

147
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,685
What?

148
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,148
I'll go. So-bong told me
not to see you for a while.

149
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,364
-What...
-There we have it.

150
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,575
For him, it's friendship.
For her, it's love.

151
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,952
She ran right over because
he called off the wedding.

152
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,371
Talk about an unrequited love.

153
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,540
I'm craving soju now.

154
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:28,127
So? You met with my dad?

155
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:32,048
I said you're my guard again,
so don't worry.

156
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,762
Yes, sir.

157
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:42,224
-Hi.
-Who was that?

158
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,810
Was it Mr. Nam?

159
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:48,105
Yes. I'm working for him again.

160
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:50,441
Purely as his guard.

161
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,151
Why does he need a guard?

162
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,528
He could even save the world alone.

163
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,613
What?

164
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,003
How did you...

165
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:13,464
I went to the hospital and saw this.

166
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,966
I just couldn't believe it,
so I recorded it.

167
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,511
I thought about it for days,

168
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,222
but my limited imagination
can't figure it out.

169
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,433
I mean, he wrecked
a car with his bare hands,

170
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,520
popped the tires,
but his hands were still fine.

171
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,357
Normally, a person's hand would
tear and bleed.

172
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:34,568
What's his deal?

173
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:36,862
Is he even human?

174
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,203
It's no use.

175
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:48,749
I knew you'd do this,
so I made a backup file already.

176
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,543
-Ms. Jo.
-If you don't tell me,

177
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,753
I'll upload this video online,

178
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:54,505
and send it to media companies.

179
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,632
Everyone in the world will want to know.

180
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:57,967
Is that okay?

181
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,766
Fine. I have no choice.

182
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,313
What it is? Tell me.

183
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,027
Well...

184
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,127
Shin.

185
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,112
I thought you didn't go to work today.

186
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,699
I had to stop by somewhere.

187
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,409
What is it?

188
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,703
So-bong is going to be my bodyguard again.

189
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:09,997
I heard from Dr. Oh.

190
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,082
You went to my mom?

191
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:13,667
Why?

192
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,004
You missed the human Nam Shin?

193
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:21,884
Now,

194
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:25,221
I know what your relationship is with him.

195
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,973
After becoming friends with So-bong,

196
00:13:28,432 --> 00:13:30,392
I can totally understand you.

197
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,230
To you, the human Nam Shin is a friend.

198
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,065
A friend who is always there.

199
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,236
Just like how So-bong
wants to protect me as a friend,

200
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:43,239
you want to protect
the human Nam Shin as well.

201
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:44,865
Right?

202
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,914
Don't you want to be friends with me?

203
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:55,584
I look exactly like the human Nam Shin.

204
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,884
Just kidding.

205
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,638
Regardless, thank you.

206
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,390
For what?

207
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:11,934
You brought me here.

208
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:15,813
Thanks to you, I experienced human life
and made a friend.

209
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,567
I think I can do better here from now on.

210
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,403
And one day,

211
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,864
I'll become friends with you.

212
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,993
Because you're a good person
I want to be friends with.

213
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,378
I guess you don't want to be my friend.

214
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:41,046
What about my big brother?

215
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:44,008
That's what the human Nam Shin calls you.

216
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,136
Think it over.

217
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:01,901
Why did you come here?

218
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,987
Let's go home.

219
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:07,239
Let's talk at home.

220
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,449
I'm not going.

221
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,659
I'll never go to that house.

222
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,829
Ye-na.

223
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,165
You're a smart kid. Why do this?

224
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,043
The wedding is over.

225
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:22,922
-It's over with Shin.
-Says who?

226
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,633
It isn't over with him.
It will never be over.

227
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,927
You're testing my patience.

228
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,971
I don't know what I'll do to him!

229
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,560
You already did.

230
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,021
What do you mean?

231
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:43,901
Ye-na.

232
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:45,945
I heard everything.

233
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,656
You tried to kill Shin.

234
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,201
-What?
-Don't you care about me?

235
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,870
I love him! How could you do that?

236
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,455
To live!

237
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,958
It was so that you and I could live.

238
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,751
I've done...

239
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:04,380
all sorts of dirty things
for the chairman.

240
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,424
He had his son do the nice things,

241
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:09,635
but he had me jump into the sewer.

242
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,138
Only because I know his dark secrets,

243
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,765
he's leaving us alone.

244
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,017
You saw before!

245
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,312
That old man will never trust me.

246
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:22,022
He'd kill me...

247
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,067
before he dies
so that I don't get in Shin's way.

248
00:16:26,276 --> 00:16:28,278
Unless I replace him as chairman,

249
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,823
I'm a dead man.

250
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:32,908
Dad.

251
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,120
Ye-na.

252
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,914
You know something about Shin, don't you?

253
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,083
He isn't normal right now, is he?

254
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,503
Tell me. That's the only way we can live.

255
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:46,672
I'm begging you.

256
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,965
Please tell me.

257
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,095
You did this to yourself.

258
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:54,888
Ye-na.

259
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,433
You didn't have to do his dirty work.

260
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,019
You did it because you wanted
something out of it!

261
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,105
You make excuses after
trying to kill a person?

262
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,233
Shouldn't you be sorry and ashamed first?

263
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,445
You're disgusting.

264
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,531
Everything in your head is disgusting.

265
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,409
Ye-na definitely knows about Shin.

266
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,702
Follow her.

267
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:28,774
Is that so precious to you?

268
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,485
Do you want to kill him that quickly?

269
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:35,405
Stop being unreasonable.

270
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,908
When your son wakes up,
I'll take him with me.

271
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:41,787
We'll go far away and live in hiding
like we did in the Czech Republic.

272
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,039
He's already accustomed
to living in society.

273
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,083
He won't want to hide.

274
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,418
You insist on activating that?

275
00:18:49,711 --> 00:18:51,630
You spent 20 years with him.

276
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,299
It's much longer than your real son.

277
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,635
Shin!

278
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,937
His... His finger moved.

279
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,231
No, right?

280
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,858
I imagined it, right?

281
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,489
It did move.

282
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,783
He's going to wake up soon.

283
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,165
Is that true?

284
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:27,833
Are you really waking up?

285
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,960
You can't tell anyone yet.

286
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,712
I won't.

287
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,672
I'll never.

288
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:37,134
When you wake up, don't forgive me.

289
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,261
Don't forgive my dad either.

290
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,514
I'll take the punishment for him.

291
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,142
I'll die if you tell me to.

292
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:48,437
She found out something
she shouldn't have.

293
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,449
CHAMPION GYM

294
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,668
Stop staring at me.

295
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,837
I'm not going anywhere.

296
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,633
I said I won't tell anyone.

297
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,676
It's not like...

298
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,887
anyone would believe me anyway.

299
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,559
Thank you.

300
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,895
It's the story of a lifetime,

301
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,438
but you gave it up.

302
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:34,816
I'm sure Mr. Nam will be
really grateful too.

303
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,240
What? A robot?

304
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:45,202
To be honest, I still can't believe it.

305
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,828
But...

306
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,456
that's my curiosity as a journalist.

307
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,208
It's a different story with you.

308
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:55,337
You left the company
because Mr. Suh scared you.

309
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,506
He sent you in there...

310
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,092
to find out Mr. Nam's real identity.

311
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,886
If he finds out you knew
and kept it from him,

312
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,471
he won't forgive you.

313
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,640
But you went back...

314
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:09,393
even when you knew all that. Why?

315
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:12,271
You should be running away.

316
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,773
Why are you endangering
yourself for a stupid robot?

317
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,775
He isn't a stupid robot.

318
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:18,652
What?

319
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,363
He doesn't just look like a person.

320
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,699
He's much better than me,
and I'm a person.

321
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,163
He knows to hug someone who's sad...

322
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,666
and to save someone who's in danger.

323
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,919
He doesn't lie and abides by the rules.

324
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,130
He always keeps his promises too.

325
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,717
He's always honest and sincere.

326
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:44,428
He's warm and smiles a lot.

327
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,639
This is serious.

328
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:51,393
You're totally a woman in love with a man.

329
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:53,979
I am not.

330
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,689
Yes, you are.

331
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,941
You're totally blinded by love...

332
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,027
and taking on all this risk.

333
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,071
Friend, I'll be there soon.

334
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:04,698
Get ready, and come out.

335
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,199
Hear that? Friend.

336
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,784
He and I are friends.

337
00:22:09,494 --> 00:22:10,704
I'm going to wash up.

338
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:34,186
Can't you give me a heads up
before grabbing my hand?

339
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:36,313
Total sleep, 5 hours and 34 minutes.

340
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:38,523
REM sleep, 1 hour and 22 minutes.

341
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,650
Why couldn't you sleep?

342
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,986
This is serious.

343
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,281
You're totally a woman in love with a man.

344
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,662
If something is bothering you,
tell me. We're friends.

345
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,958
That's right. We're friends.

346
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,711
What?

347
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:03,548
Why did you lie?

348
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,301
Aren't we friends?
You don't want to be my friend?

349
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:09,096
What do you mean?
That was an error on your part.

350
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,394
It was not.

351
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,657
I told Ji Young-hoon to be my friend too.

352
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:33,662
-What did he say?
-He doesn't want to be my friend.

353
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,164
Even though he opened up to me
after getting drunk.

354
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,707
He did?

355
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,001
What did he say?

356
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,671
It's a secret. I can't tell you that.

357
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,674
Fine. That's probably your rule.

358
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,301
What's his problem?

359
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,304
He mocked me for confusing you
with a person.

360
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,894
Why? Does it hurt?

361
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,815
That's right. You can't feel pain.

362
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,192
Something must be wrong
with my FT sensor.

363
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:08,155
I broke a car for a friend recently,
you see.

364
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:14,035
That friend is too embarrassed
to thank you outright.

365
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,208
What about your hand?

366
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:24,087
It's not serious.
I'll ask Mom to take a look.

367
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,066
Hi. Let's go in.

368
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,902
Yes, Mom.

369
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,786
What's up with her? She isn't mad today.

370
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:59,831
What happens if you have
a heart attack while driving?

371
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:04,669
The car may strike other cars
or hit a pedestrian.

372
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,923
A driver's heart attack may
cause serious accidents.

373
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,808
You may sit.

374
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:41,122
-Please continue.
-Yes, sir.

375
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:45,168
As Ms. Oh said,
if our M Car was connected...

376
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:48,129
to the driver's health monitor,

377
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:51,466
the instant the driver's heart fails,

378
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,218
the car will drive
to the nearest hospital.

379
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,512
The car will save people's lives.

380
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:59,558
We can adjust the oxygen level in the car
to assist the driver's breathing.

381
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,060
It may detect blood pressure
problems as well.

382
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:06,273
We can detect the driver's biorhythm
to calculate stress levels too.

383
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:10,068
When it's low, it can play
preferred music or videos.

384
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,821
It cares for the driver's
physical and mental health.

385
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:15,657
M Car isn't just a self-driving car.

386
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,159
It cares for the driver's physical
and mental health.

387
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:22,205
M Car can have another meaning:
Medical Car.

388
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,293
We can call it Medicar for short.

389
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:28,503
That is a great approach.

390
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,506
I'll buy it first. Make it right now.

391
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,175
Every old person like me
will rush to buy it.

392
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:36,970
Anyone who's concerned about their health,

393
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,597
regardless of age, will buy it.

394
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,599
Make it quickly.

395
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:43,059
Pitch it to the shareholders
at next week's meeting.

396
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,769
Yes, sir.

397
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,980
It's nice seeing you work hard.

398
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,317
The team members look happy too.

399
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,584
Thank you, Young-hoon.

400
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,086
Thanks to your hard work,

401
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,840
he is finally becoming
a decent human being.

402
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,510
Mr. Shin's abilities are showing
their potential now.

403
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,679
Don't loosen up just because he's working.

404
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,890
Keep him tight.

405
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,933
See you later.

406
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:33,276
Thanks, bro.

407
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,987
It's all thanks to you, bro.

408
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,115
Don't call me that.

409
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:44,204
I was just kidding. Are you angry?

410
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:46,247
Is something wrong?

411
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:50,251
The chairman praised you,
but you looked guilty.

412
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,672
Go ahead. I need to discuss
business with So-bong.

413
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,265
What is it?

414
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:08,103
You played a big part in Mr. Shin
being accepted by the chairman.

415
00:28:08,895 --> 00:28:10,313
I wanted to tell you that.

416
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,982
Are you going somewhere?

417
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:15,735
What's gotten into you?

418
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,570
I've gotten busy,

419
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:20,407
so I'll leave you to care
for Mr. Shin on your own.

420
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,284
Please continue to be of strength to him.

421
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,580
Why are you suddenly doing this?
Just how busy are you?

422
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:43,888
How did I do today?

423
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,807
You were great.

424
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,435
Chairman Nam seemed very pleased.

425
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,145
Even if I do it my way,

426
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:52,564
I'll make sure it doesn't
hurt the human Nam Shin.

427
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:55,775
I'll make things better for him
when he wakes up, so don't worry.

428
00:28:56,693 --> 00:29:00,071
Okay. Do everything as you please now.

429
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,199
Do you trust me?

430
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,411
Did you call me here to ask that?

431
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,496
I'll stop by later.

432
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,623
-The FT sensor became dull...
-No!

433
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:13,543
Sorry?

434
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:15,670
Well...

435
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,049
There's a problem with the lab.

436
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,261
I'll call you when it's fixed.
Don't come before then.

437
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,097
Bye.

438
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,574
What did you talk about?

439
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:47,494
There's a problem with her lab.

440
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,537
She said not to come until it's fixed.

441
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:51,289
Really?

442
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:53,750
I'll look into it.

443
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,544
-How?
-I have my ways.

444
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:06,221
This is So-bong.
May I ask you something?

445
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,181
Mr. Nam's hand is stiff.

446
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,058
When will the lab repairs be done?

447
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,392
The lab?

448
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,604
Did someone say it's broken?

449
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:15,647
What?

450
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,191
Dr. Oh said...

451
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:23,029
You played a big part in Mr. Shin
being accepted by the chairman.

452
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,824
Please continue to be of strength to him.

453
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,201
The lab is fine, isn't it?

454
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,079
Something happened there, didn't it?

455
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:33,915
So-bong.

456
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,292
Mr. Ji and Dr. Oh are acting strange.

457
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:38,086
Why are you keeping us from there?

458
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,421
I'm going to go there right now.

459
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,319
Were you afraid I'd find out?

460
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,906
Did you hide the fact
that the real Nam Shin woke up...

461
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,284
in case I'd tell Mr. Shin
about that horrible thing?

462
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,870
-So-bong.
-Are you afraid he'll run away?

463
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:16,249
He wouldn't run away because of his mom.

464
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,377
You speak of him as if he were a person.

465
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,130
You made him look like one
and treated him like one.

466
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,133
Didn't you?

467
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,887
Don't tell him about the kill switch.

468
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,972
It's too late to turn back,

469
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,391
it won't do any good if he finds out.

470
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,311
I wouldn't tell him
even if you told me to.

471
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:39,314
I can't tell him something so cruel.

472
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:43,776
But call him and tell him
that Nam Shin is waking up.

473
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:45,570
What?

474
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,864
If it weren't for him,
you couldn't have gotten this far.

475
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,700
Don't make him a fool that gets played.

476
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,036
-Tell him yourself.
-Hey.

477
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:55,204
Should I tell him...

478
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,123
about the kill switch?

479
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,220
Shin, it's me.

480
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:13,640
I need to tell you something.

481
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:17,018
Something happened yesterday.

482
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,564
You'll be happy to hear it too.

483
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,215
-Hi.
-Where are you?

484
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,883
-What?
-Why aren't you coming?

485
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,385
I'm in the bathroom.

486
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:51,803
I'll be right there.

487
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:00,478
How did you find me?

488
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:01,813
GPS?

489
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:05,024
This is the staircase. Why did you lie?

490
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,359
Just...

491
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:09,946
The human Nam Shin is waking up.

492
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:13,157
-What?
-Mom just told me.

493
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,326
His pupil is responding,
and his finger moved.

494
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,454
I see. That's great.

495
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,999
Why do you look like that?

496
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,625
Did something bad happen?

497
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,961
No. I'm fine.

498
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,754
I can read expressions like that.

499
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,172
Don't hide it. Tell me.

500
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,882
I'm not hiding anything.

501
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,386
You're lying.

502
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,179
Why are you lying again?

503
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,891
So-bong.

504
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,602
Who are you to track me and read my mind?

505
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,230
GPS? Lie detector?

506
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,607
Doing that isn't real.

507
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,317
When I want to be alone, let me.

508
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,319
I don't want to get caught,
pretend not to know.

509
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,739
That's what you do if you really know me.

510
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:56,993
I'm leaving.

511
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:07,962
Sorry.

512
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,465
I didn't mean to tell her...

513
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,342
This wouldn't have happened
if you didn't pick up her call at all.

514
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,596
I told you to be careful.
How could you do this in just one day?

515
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:18,139
I never agreed to it.

516
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:20,767
-You decided that on your own.
-It's because I'm nervous.

517
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,019
Something may happen before Shin wakes up.

518
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,730
David.

519
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,357
You always thought from my perspective.

520
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:30,777
-Why are you being like this?
-Because I always did.

521
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,571
I thought you'd think
of my perspective this time.

522
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,200
So I'm pleading with you one last time.

523
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:39,535
If you're going to dump him,
dump him to me.

524
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,437
It's me, Mr. Chairman.

525
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:08,940
You need to know something.

526
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,238
I understand, so stop.

527
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:20,409
He really is my flesh and blood
since he didn't die...

528
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:23,037
and is making a miraculous comeback.

529
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,415
Anyway,

530
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,168
about the kill switch.

531
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:31,963
That can never be activated.

532
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,506
We can't have...

533
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:37,426
something you and I
worked on for decades be destroyed.

534
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,346
Do whatever it takes to stop her.

535
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,556
If not,

536
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:45,852
you'll be useless to me as well.

537
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:03,035
The test installation
of the chip has been completed.

538
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,831
The M Car now has
a perfect anti-hacking system.

539
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,917
You closed at the price
Shin requested, correct?

540
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,419
Yes.

541
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:14,130
It was tough to lower
the price at the last minute.

542
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:15,631
I heard...

543
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,385
you attended the self-driving car
team's meeting.

544
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,472
Another M Car. "Medical Car."

545
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,017
What a great idea.

546
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,812
I never knew Mr. Nam...

547
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:33,024
was hiding such creativity and drive.

548
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,569
Even I never imagined...

549
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,030
he'd be able to do that much.

550
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,078
You still haven't found Ye-na?

551
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,122
She left her phone off,

552
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,540
so we can't track her.

553
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,292
Please wait a little longer.

554
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,430
CHAMPION GYM

555
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:20,529
Who are you to track me and read my mind?

556
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:22,865
GPS? Lie detector?

557
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,201
Doing that isn't real.

558
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,329
I've lost my mind.

559
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:29,914
He doesn't know anything.

560
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:49,433
Maibo.

561
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,801
Why are you doing this too?

562
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,012
I thought you really disappeared.

563
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,105
The human Nam Shin is waking up.

564
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,360
Who cares about this stupid robot?

565
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,031
Sorry about earlier.

566
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,743
I won't track you ever again.

567
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:52,204
I'm sorry for not understanding.

568
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,041
I'm sorry I'm a robot.

569
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,768
Would it have been better
if I were a person?

570
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,405
You said that before.

571
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,658
You wished I wasn't a robot.

572
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,039
What happens to me when
the human Nam Shin wakes up?

573
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,542
Where should I be, and what should I do?

574
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:43,047
I'm a robot, so I need to be useful.

575
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,760
But I'll be useless to Mom then.

576
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,429
Why are you useless?

577
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:53,557
You're useful enough for me.

578
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,353
That's why I'm thankful.

579
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,814
You understand me.

580
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,317
That's why I want to understand you...

581
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:06,862
like a real human friend.

582
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,366
Who asked for that?

583
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:13,702
You're just you.
You just have to be there.

584
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:17,415
I don't need anything.
Don't disappear. Just stay here.

585
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,418
Why would I disappear?

586
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:23,963
I'm right here.

587
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,117
What are you doing?

588
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,661
-I'm not crying.
-You want to cry.

589
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:57,746
I know.

590
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,792
Cry all you want, So-bong.

591
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,395
You're a robot.

592
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,065
But why does my heart hurt so much?

593
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,405
NAM SHIN

594
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,707
Are you sleeping already?
Why aren't you picking up?

595
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,963
If you don't pick up,
I have to track you via GPS.

596
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:31,882
But I won't...

597
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,386
since you may want to be alone.

598
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,980
She didn't say a word all weekend long.

599
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,565
What's wrong with her?

600
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,568
You shouldn't bother people
when they're working out.

601
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,819
Go back in.

602
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:05,768
She didn't call.

603
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:17,029
We have to leave now
to rehearse the presentation.

604
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,572
Get ready.

605
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,540
What's wrong?
Is something wrong?

606
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,001
So-bong cried.

607
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,212
She said her heart hurt because of me.

608
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,549
She won't answer her phone,
but I shouldn't track her.

609
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,551
What should I do?

610
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,349
I'm sure she needs time too.

611
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,687
I'm sure she'll call soon.

612
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:54,441
Exactly how long is "soon" to humans?

613
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:59,446
24 hours? Or 48 hours?

614
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:05,869
"Waiting" can't be measured in numbers.

615
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:10,374
It's until the other person feels
better and returns.

616
00:45:12,167 --> 00:45:13,877
Until she returns.

617
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:21,844
Until she returns.

618
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:31,228
Is it today at the shareholders meeting
that he's giving the presentation?

619
00:45:31,729 --> 00:45:32,896
Yes. I'll be back soon.

620
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,399
Please look after Shin.

621
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,567
Don't worry.

622
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,419
Why are you drinking wine
so early in the morning?

623
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,214
Because nothing is going right.

624
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,176
If Shin gives a great presentation,

625
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,719
it's over for me.

626
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,639
Ms. Suh turned on her phone.

627
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,808
We've located her.

628
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,078
Are you insane?

629
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,247
Do you really want to fight me?

630
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:16,750
Hey. So-bong.

631
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:18,293
Let her be.

632
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,048
See you later.

633
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,887
Have you lost your mind too?

634
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:30,722
If stopping her doesn't work,

635
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:33,058
it's best to let her go as far as she can.

636
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,979
That's not what this is about.

637
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,481
-You don't know anything.
-I do too.

638
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:43,694
That crush whom my daughter
insists is a friend.

639
00:47:43,944 --> 00:47:45,821
It's not a friend like that.

640
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,157
Then what? What is it?

641
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:53,996
I don't know.

642
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:08,844
DAD

643
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,776
Jongno-gu, Cheongjin-dong.

644
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,779
I can find the exact address in no time.

645
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,568
Did you think I wouldn't find you?

646
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:10,614
Although your car is right there?

647
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:15,786
Which house is it?

648
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:22,292
Over there. It's Dr. Oh's house.

649
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:25,087
She let me stay since I had nowhere to go.

650
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:30,258
I saw you coming out of this house.

651
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,430
Why are you still lying to me?

652
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,392
What are you hiding in there?

653
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:39,685
Nothing.

654
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,353
It's just because...

655
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:44,398
I didn't want you to know
where Dr. Oh lives.

656
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,985
Let's go in.

657
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,988
-Dad.
-If you stop me now,

658
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,281
I don't know what I'll do to you.

659
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:58,286
Don't make me become any crueler.

660
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:00,914
Let go.

661
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,049
What you want isn't in there.

662
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:13,510
It's at the office.

663
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,394
What do you mean by that?

664
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:25,856
What is that?

665
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:36,783
Young-hoon.

666
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,829
Wouldn't the chairman want
to see the rehearsal?

667
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,082
I'll bring him.

668
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:45,792
Wait inside.

669
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,891
My son. It's good to see you.

670
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:02,517
It's nicer to see you outside.

671
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,311
What brings you here?

672
00:51:04,394 --> 00:51:05,645
Is Nam Shin doing well?

673
00:51:06,605 --> 00:51:08,148
Why are you worrying about that punk?

674
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,150
He's doing overly well, so don't worry.

675
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,819
Why are you annoyed?

676
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:14,821
Is something wrong?

677
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:18,658
Well,

678
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:21,078
there's something you need to know.

679
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,259
Go ahead.

680
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,469
Yes, ma'am.

681
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,691
Please. I'm begging you.

682
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:54,945
Get rid of the kill switch.

683
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,865
I'll make sure he doesn't hurt you
or the Mr. Nam in bed.

684
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:02,494
Don't do this.

685
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,125
I'll tell everything...

686
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:13,755
about everything
I saw and everything I know.

687
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,757
I'll expose everything.

688
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:19,219
People will be shocked that
a robot replaced a person.

689
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:20,554
That will...

690
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:24,057
only speed up
activating the kill switch...

691
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:27,894
since I'll have to prove
no such robot exists.

692
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,939
-Dr. Oh.
-I'm telling you to stay out of it.

693
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,983
It won't change anything.

694
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,652
Shin will wake up,

695
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,613
and everything will go back
to the way it belongs.

696
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,699
Not everything.

697
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,369
since he'll be gone from this world.

698
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,707
Is this why you created him?

699
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,711
He disgusted me at first,
but even I care for him now.

700
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:55,255
How could his mom of 20 years be so cold?

701
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,216
Is this why you started this?

702
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,094
Did you plan to dump him
after making him comfort you?

703
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,472
That's not a real mom.

704
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:07,058
That's just a disgustingly
self-centered human.

705
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:10,979
Criticize me all you want...

706
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:14,191
because I know
I can't be a mom to them both.

707
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,725
I haven't seen him that focused...

708
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,269
in a very long time.

709
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:25,470
You asked me, right?

710
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,847
You asked me what I meant
by telling you not to disappear.

711
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,814
I'll tell you, so let's go.

712
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:37,649
You can't be here.

713
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,903
You always do as I say.

714
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:44,698
If you want to stay by my side, let's go.

715
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,994
I want to do that with you.

716
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,205
I don't want you to disappear.

717
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,124
Why?

718
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,752
Because I like you.

719
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,716
I like you.

720
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:05,468
I just like you.
I like you unconditionally.

721
00:55:06,219 --> 00:55:09,264
So don't stay with these people.
Go with me.

722
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,685
I like you.

723
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:15,353
Let's go!

724
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,646
Mr. Nam!

725
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,700
Are you going somewhere?

726
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,785
We need to talk.

727
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,636
Mr. Nam. You are incredible.

728
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:51,681
You almost had me fooled.

729
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:54,726
Your mother...

730
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,229
is Dr. Oh up there, right?

731
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,068
She is your mother,

732
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:05,570
but she didn't give birth to you.

733
00:56:05,737 --> 00:56:07,322
She built you.

734
00:56:09,157 --> 00:56:10,241
Mr. Suh.

735
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,535
What do you think you're doing?

736
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:15,246
Stay quiet.

737
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:18,083
Do you think you can hide this?

738
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:21,252
I know everything,
so you're done with.

739
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,630
We didn't hide anything.
Stop this nonsense.

740
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:24,881
Mr. Park!

741
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,377
You're Korea's top AI researcher.

742
00:57:03,294 --> 00:57:04,754
Even still,

743
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:08,174
I never expected you to create
a monster like this.

744
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:19,519
If you made a young Shin,

745
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,943
you could've easily made an adult version.

746
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:30,363
Answer me, doctor.

747
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:34,826
Is that really a human being?

748
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:43,001
That monster sitting there isn't real.

749
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,088
It's a robot that looks just like Mr. Nam!

750
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,718
Okay. Now, will you...

751
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:56,389
still insist you're a human
of flesh and blood?

752
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:05,398
We need to go.

753
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,649
Let's go!

754
00:58:10,403 --> 00:58:11,488
What's wrong?

755
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:39,098
Blood...

756
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,019
Why are you...

757
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:54,113
Have you never seen a person bleed before?

758
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,377
You like me?

759
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:10,004
Who do you think you are?

760
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,035
Did you really consider
that thing to be your son?

761
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,787
Bring me that.

762
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,914
You look just like a human.

763
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:46,499
Don't go anywhere.

764
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,419
You're not my friend anymore
because I like you now.

765
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:51,212
I can feel your heart.

766
00:59:51,838 --> 00:59:53,840
