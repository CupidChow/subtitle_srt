1
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:32,866
After videos of an heir
of a conglomerate

2
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:36,828
assaulting a guard went viral online,
the abuse of power

3
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,956
by the privileged is being criticized.

4
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,918
The man in the video assaulted the guard
for photographing him...

5
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,672
Shin, you don't plan to return, do you?

6
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:49,799
Just wait.

7
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:51,801
Something very amusing will happen soon.

8
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,429
Was this what you meant...

9
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,765
by something amusing?

10
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:00,602
If that's the case,

11
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:03,855
I'll play a little prank as well.

12
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:07,358
Where's Jung-woo?

13
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,277
Why are you asking
about someone who's dead?

14
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,361
Dead?

15
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,363
Don't let him go! Let go of me!

16
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,907
-Dad!
-Jung-woo!

17
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:15,116
Jung-woo!

18
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:20,455
How's this? Amusing, right?

19
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,667
Where is it?
Where's the scar you had here?

20
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,962
Dad. Why are you doing this again?

21
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,464
Jung-woo died.

22
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,966
He isn't Jung-woo. He's Shin!

23
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,594
Now that I've fooled you,

24
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,971
I'll play a bigger prank.

25
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,645
Let's see who's really on my side...

26
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,732
and who betrays me.

27
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,901
I'll test them.

28
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,028
Yes, my dad has dementia.

29
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:55,615
Happy now?

30
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,833
I...

31
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,629
I have dementia, Shin.

32
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:17,428
You don't have dementia,

33
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:18,930
Grandpa.

34
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,736
How did I know?

35
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,198
I thought it was strange.

36
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,744
You're a man
who doesn't believe in "impossible."

37
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:46,207
How could someone like that give up
right away just because he has dementia?

38
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,795
I guess I overdid it.

39
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,591
Imagine how stressed out...

40
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,802
the people who think
I have dementia must be.

41
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,556
Now, I'll get to watch their show.

42
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,225
It's going to be so fun.

43
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:07,979
Until then,

44
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,399
keep your mouths shut, okay?

45
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,694
I believe I don't need
to threaten you guys.

46
00:03:14,777 --> 00:03:16,654
Don't worry. We'll keep quiet.

47
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:18,990
You too.

48
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,409
You don't have to worry.

49
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,287
Not you. The one behind you.

50
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:43,514
Shin was wrong.

51
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:47,393
Even I became weak
as I have gotten older.

52
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:52,649
Are you disappointed
that I deceived you, too?

53
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,028
It's because I'm old.

54
00:03:58,112 --> 00:03:59,614
I know it's pointless,

55
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:02,033
but I want to see through people.

56
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,620
Because of the crazy things I did,

57
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,581
I know how you feel now,
and I'm happy about it.

58
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,127
You're different from Jong-gil.

59
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,838
Why do you never try...

60
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:19,092
to stab me in the back like he does?

61
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,055
Young-hoon.

62
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,809
Do you want to try calling me Grandpa?

63
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,521
Sorry?

64
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:36,442
I'm just joking. You must be tired.

65
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,320
Go upstairs now.

66
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:44,742
Goodnight.

67
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:51,541
You can call me Grandpa
whenever you want.

68
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:54,752
I'll just consider you
as another grandson.

69
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,358
How could he tell such a lie?

70
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,862
Be careful not to get caught by him.

71
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,780
He's scary.

72
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,533
I'm not afraid of any human being.

73
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,869
It's not human beings
you should be afraid of,

74
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,413
but the things human beings do.

75
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:33,291
What if he smashes or melts you?

76
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,091
It's Mr. Suh. What should I do?

77
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,345
What if he asks about Mr. Nam's dementia?

78
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,096
Take it.

79
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,432
Put it on speaker, and do as I say.

80
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,142
Okay.

81
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,144
GOLD MINE

82
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:56,564
Hello, Mr. Suh.
I was about to call you.

83
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,609
You were at the chairman's
house today, right?

84
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,402
Did you see the chairman?

85
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,658
Yes. He was acting a bit strange.

86
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,704
He was keeping an eye on me,
so I couldn't call you.

87
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,915
I see.

88
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,834
Has he ever been visited by his lawyer...

89
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,920
regarding his will?

90
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,717
Not that I've heard of.

91
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:27,011
See if Shin or Young-hoon...

92
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,847
do anything to the chairman.

93
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:32,100
Yes, Mr. Suh.

94
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:33,976
By the way,

95
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,522
Ye-na was there too, right?

96
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,568
Yes. Didn't she tell you?

97
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:47,198
Ms. Kang. No one should find out
I know about the chairman's condition.

98
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,075
Not even Ye-na.

99
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,289
What? He doesn't trust
even his own daughter?

100
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,168
The dad and the daughter
are deceiving each other...

101
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:02,380
They'd be so shocked if they knew.

102
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:05,091
Let's pretend the chairman has dementia

103
00:07:05,174 --> 00:07:07,468
until Mr. Suh takes the bait.

104
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,639
Some are pretending he has dementia,

105
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,766
and some are pretending
not to know about it.

106
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,643
Everyone is lying.

107
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:19,605
I don't have to hold anyone's hand.
I'll keep winking.

108
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:34,078
Dad must have found out.

109
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,546
It'll spill over.

110
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,090
What was on your mind?

111
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,177
I'm just a bit tired.

112
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,931
Ye-na was there too, right?

113
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,726
Yes. Didn't she tell you?

114
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,898
Don't you have anything to tell me?

115
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,317
What, about you?

116
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,319
Do you have anything to tell me?

117
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,488
Well...

118
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,782
I want you to go out with another guy.

119
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,868
Let me pick one for you.

120
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,416
I want you to learn to be happy.

121
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,211
As a dad, as a father-in-law,

122
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:25,713
and as a grandfather.
Like any ordinary old man.

123
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:28,132
We can all be happy.

124
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,760
"Any ordinary old man"?

125
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,724
I've never had such a dream like that.

126
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:10,550
Let's pretend the chairman has dementia

127
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:13,094
until Mr. Suh takes the bait.

128
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,974
What if I get caught by Mr. Suh first?

129
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:24,063
It's time to work out. Get up.

130
00:09:25,356 --> 00:09:26,983
Get out.

131
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,904
Hey. Do you have a death wish?

132
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,114
I can't die.

133
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,283
It's a rule to work out
if you gain weight.

134
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:39,495
You weigh 830g more than last week.

135
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,038
Change into your workout clothes.

136
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:42,415
How dare you scan me?

137
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,710
I have no energy.
You work out as much as you want.

138
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,337
You have no energy?
Do you want me to help you change?

139
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,300
-What?
-Don't tell me you're feeling shy.

140
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,176
I'm a robot, so it's fine.

141
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:55,595
No.

142
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,806
I'll get changed by myself. Get out.

143
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,810
Hurry up. You should work out
at the designated time.

144
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,440
What's with him?

145
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,738
Why don't we stop?
I don't have much energy today.

146
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,157
It's been only 17 minutes and 43 seconds,

147
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,867
and you've burned only 78 calories.

148
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,286
I'm a human being. I might die.

149
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,413
Exercise addiction can cause death.

150
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:30,546
I can't breathe. I think I'm going to die.

151
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:35,009
You're right.
You need mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

152
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,804
I didn't mean it literally.

153
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,098
Did your lie detector break down?

154
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,477
It's what you do all the time.
Did you fall for it?

155
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,188
How dare you?
You should just believe me.

156
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,523
How dare a machine like you
fool its master?

157
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,318
Get on my back.
I'll cut you some slack.

158
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:55,279
Why do you keep showing
your back to me? Get away.

159
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,447
I won't.

160
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,200
You said you had no feelings for me.

161
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,369
I'm a piece of metal to you.
What's the problem?

162
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:04,747
Fine. I'll get on your back.

163
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,422
You slept for 5 hours
and 33 minutes last night...

164
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,841
and got an hour
and 54 minutes of deep sleep.

165
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,344
Compared to people
around your age in your area,

166
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,179
your sleep quality is below average.

167
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:22,890
Are you a sleep specialist or something?

168
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,309
You even care about how much I sleep now?

169
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,561
Why couldn't you sleep?

170
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:29,730
Because of Mr. Suh?

171
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:35,945
It seemed like things
were getting complicated.

172
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:40,574
Hiding your identity
from Mr. Suh is hard enough.

173
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:44,286
And it turns out the chairman
doesn't have dementia.

174
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,580
There's so much to think about.

175
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,210
I'm a thousand times
stronger than a human.

176
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:53,754
My intellectual capacity is incomparable.

177
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,132
And using my network,
I can find out anything.

178
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,592
Why are you suddenly bragging?

179
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,095
You're still just a machine.

180
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,848
I'm saying that you can relax...

181
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,934
as long as I'm with you.

182
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,649
Hey. Put me down.

183
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,359
I want to run again.

184
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,949
If you go ahead of me, you're dead.

185
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,161
Stay behind your master, and follow me.

186
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,990
This would've been hard to survive.

187
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,826
It must be too late already.
The blood smells horrible.

188
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,594
He's looking good. Too good.

189
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,232
Your blood pressure is 138 over 74.
Your pulse 135.

190
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,483
You'll calm down soon.

191
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,027
Please be careful around here.

192
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:41,695
If someone finds out you're a robot...

193
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,031
Robot?

194
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,245
You said I can have this robot.

195
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,705
I'll take it right now.

196
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,458
Mom!

197
00:13:57,711 --> 00:13:59,547
I told you these kind of toys

198
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:01,549
will make you like that guy.

199
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,134
Grandpa is up.

200
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,011
Let's go say hi to him.

201
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,596
I'm scared of Grandpa.

202
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,890
I said this is for your sake, Hee-dong.

203
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,058
Mom.

204
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,184
Come on.

205
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:22,611
IMPLANTABLE CARDIOVERTER-DEFIBRILLATOR
A DEVICE IMPLANTED INSIDE THE BODY

206
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:25,948
WHICH PERFORMS CARDIOVERSION
AND DEFIBRILLATION

207
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,118
I thought he figured it out.

208
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,578
Who is he?

209
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,956
No Hee-dong, seven years old.

210
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,624
He's our friend.

211
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,543
He's a cyborg like you, So-bong.

212
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,420
What? A cyborg?

213
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:42,590
Does he have something
implanted in his body?

214
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,998
Dad, he's not a coward.

215
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:17,666
You don't know how brave he is.

216
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,919
He's your kind of boy.

217
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:23,047
Please be nice to him.

218
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,008
All right. Go back to your boy.

219
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,929
I don't care about my boy
when I have my sick dad here.

220
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,226
All right.

221
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,652
Look at his cold eyes.
No wonder he scares him.

222
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:47,404
Hee-dong.

223
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:50,282
Hee-dong, where are you?

224
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,617
Where's Hee-dong?

225
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,702
Why are you looking for him?

226
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,914
You want to report that
he stole your action figures?

227
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,710
Hee-dong.

228
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,546
Hee-dong.

229
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,308
Hee-dong.

230
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:18,477
Hee-dong.

231
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:23,816
Let's go say sorry to Grandpa.

232
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,318
Here you are.

233
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,321
Kid, what's wrong?

234
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,406
Hee-dong.

235
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,415
I'll take care of him.
You can go do your things.

236
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,250
Mom.

237
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,711
My heart...

238
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,547
I've got to call an ambulance.

239
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,632
Don't make any call.

240
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:53,762
If Grandpa finds out that I'm sick...

241
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,180
Hee-dong.

242
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:56,765
Hee-dong.

243
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,518
What are you doing?

244
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:02,646
Why is this here?

245
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:05,232
Ambulance...

246
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,904
Hey! Are you crazy?

247
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,949
Kid, are you okay?

248
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:22,249
Hee-dong, are you all right?

249
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,254
Can you breathe?

250
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,549
He has an ICD in his heart, doesn't he?

251
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:34,970
What will you do if he gets arrhythmia
again and the ICD stops working?

252
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,517
How do you know that?

253
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,186
If you don't want to see his heart stop,

254
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,313
don't let him have
a cellphone within a 15cm radius.

255
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:45,939
Give it to him.

256
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,700
Hee-dong, get on my back.

257
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,793
That was close.

258
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,921
You saved his life.

259
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:33,153
Kid, why did you say
we shouldn't call an ambulance?

260
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:37,407
If Grandpa finds out that I'm sick,
he'll hate me.

261
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,913
Being weak is a bad thing.

262
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,332
Being weak is not a bad thing.

263
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,293
Hating to be weak is a bad thing.

264
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,171
Being sick is not a bad thing,
so don't hide it.

265
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,298
Do you understand, kid?

266
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,557
I'm scared.

267
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,891
SUH JONG-GIL

268
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:06,311
This guy will threaten my mom again.

269
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,313
I'll kick his butt.

270
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,107
This is our secret.

271
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:11,775
Really?

272
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,903
What are you doing with him?

273
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:19,825
You.

274
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:22,703
Don't you talk about Hee-dong to Dad.

275
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,787
I won't.

276
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:26,498
It's a rule to keep promises.

277
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,624
"A rule"?

278
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,751
You?

279
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,715
Get out.

280
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,467
I told you to get out.

281
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,401
How is the kid? Is he okay?

282
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,446
Yes. Don't say that he's sick.

283
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,614
I promised.

284
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,158
That's why it took so long?

285
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,534
The rest is a secret.

286
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,329
A secret?

287
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:08,665
Hey, let me come with you.

288
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,503
We need solid evidence
of the chairman's dementia.

289
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,298
I'll be looking forward to your reply.

290
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,010
Mom, don't listen to him.

291
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,554
Somebody is going to kick his butt.

292
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,431
Could you please be quiet, Hee-dong?

293
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:27,601
He's going to figure out
you're sick because of you.

294
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,609
Dr. Lee, it's me.

295
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,781
I want a doctor's note for my dad.

296
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,784
Thank you for coming.

297
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:36,044
There's a rumor about Mr. Nam
in the stock market.

298
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,754
Have you heard about it?

299
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,464
What rumor are you talking about?

300
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,884
I heard he is seriously ill.

301
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,345
Mr. Cha, what are you talking about?

302
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,598
He's ill? What disease does he have?

303
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,892
It's misinformation.

304
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:56,857
This is his doctor's note.

305
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,360
-It says he has dementia.
-Mr. Suh.

306
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,407
He must've hidden it
for the company's sake.

307
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:08,076
But you can't hide it forever.

308
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,705
I'm thinking of suggesting
a stockholder meeting

309
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,624
regarding his resignation
at the meeting later.

310
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:17,419
Do you all agree?

311
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:21,840
It's hard to believe that he has dementia.

312
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,511
He does have dementia.

313
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,776
You're a chief director
who is waiting to be assigned.

314
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,278
What are you doing
at the management meeting?

315
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,115
I can't miss talking
about my grandfather's dementia.

316
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:51,578
He does have dementia and that's my seat.
What are you expecting?

317
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,499
You must be confused.

318
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,087
The chairman's illness
affects the company...

319
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:25,487
What's wrong?

320
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,573
Is there something in here
that can't be revealed?

321
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,163
We should call a shareholders' meeting...

322
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:37,290
and get rid of Nam Gun-ho.

323
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,836
Let's get the tabloids involved.

324
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,462
Make them as nasty as possible.

325
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:46,007
He's been there long enough.
He should know when to step down.

326
00:23:48,552 --> 00:23:50,387
You shouldn't be so greedy.

327
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,973
He's disgusting and sickening.

328
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,102
I saw that Mr. Suh called.

329
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:59,146
Would it be okay if Grandpa finds out?

330
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,773
-Shin, why you...
-Do as I say.

331
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,402
For Hee-dong's sake.

332
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,118
What's wrong with calling a meeting?

333
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:14,369
That's right.

334
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:18,457
Haven't you seen companies fail
because the owner had dementia?

335
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:20,709
We need to make contingency plans

336
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,128
to minimize the damage.

337
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,046
Because he doesn't have dementia.

338
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,677
-He doesn't?
-What?

339
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,850
What... what did you just say?

340
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,311
What... what do you mean?

341
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:40,812
What are you saying?

342
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,231
Mr. Ji.

343
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,414
Dr. Lee.

344
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,001
There must have been a mistake.

345
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,088
I think someone else's medical report...

346
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,674
was sent with the chairman's name on it.

347
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,718
-My apologies.
-How...

348
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,806
I'm Dr. Lee Sung-ho,
Chairman Nam's doctor.

349
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:24,105
This is his real medical report.

350
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:25,857
You can check it.

351
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,736
If you'd like to verify anything else,

352
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,947
you may go to the hospital with me.

353
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,532
Mr. Suh.

354
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,992
What's going on?

355
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,787
I'm sure you understand what's going on,

356
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,122
so resolve the rest with him.

357
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,457
Please come in.

358
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:17,993
Use Ho-yun to get Jong-gil?

359
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,037
Yes. I told her what to do.

360
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,039
I've contacted Dr. Lee.

361
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:25,208
But please forgive her.

362
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,460
You need to think about Hee-dong.

363
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,078
Did you hear me scold Mr. Suh?

364
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,955
That's right. I heard from outside.

365
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,167
Did you get him because of me?

366
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,169
Partially that, and for other reasons too.

367
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,839
I was cooler than when I said,
"What must I mess with?"

368
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,049
Right?

369
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,426
No. Neither of that seemed cool.

370
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,806
You're lying. Both were cool.

371
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,308
I'm not lying.

372
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,937
This.

373
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:36,571
Where's the robot watch?
The battery's dying.

374
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,950
In the car. The key is in the office.

375
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,498
We should call a shareholders' meeting...

376
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,708
and get rid of Nam Gun-ho.

377
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,503
Let's get the tabloids involved.

378
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:53,213
Make them as nasty as possible.

379
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,841
He's been there long enough.
He should know when to step down.

380
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,721
You shouldn't be so greedy.

381
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,391
He's disgusting and sickening.

382
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,447
Your voice is missing in the recording.

383
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:25,245
I guess you've had your hopes up.

384
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,289
I'm sorry, but I don't have dementia.

385
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,376
No, sir.

386
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,253
It's all my fault.

387
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:37,340
Please punish me for not teaching
my people better.

388
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,926
What? Mr. Suh.

389
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,636
A shareholders' meeting?

390
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,098
Even if the chairman is sick,

391
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,350
how could you bring this up?

392
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,436
You're fired right now!

393
00:28:50,854 --> 00:28:53,773
That's right! It was all Mr. Kim.

394
00:28:54,023 --> 00:28:57,777
He suggested to tell the tabloids
to spread the news anyway.

395
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:13,960
Here, Slave.

396
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:23,011
If people find out I'm a robot,

397
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:26,973
will they really break me or melt me down?

398
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,683
-What?
-I saw the look...

399
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,978
on Mr. Suh's face
when he realized he was fooled.

400
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,440
Last time, you said...

401
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,026
that people aren't scary,

402
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,361
but what people do that's scary.

403
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,740
If Grandpa and Mr. Suh...

404
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:47,243
find out that I'm not the real Nam Shin,

405
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:50,163
they won't leave me alone, right?

406
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,416
I won't let them.

407
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,170
I'm 1,000 times weaker than you,

408
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,714
and my intellect doesn't compare to yours.

409
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,009
I'm not digital in any way,
and I'm incompetent.

410
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,513
But I'll protect you somehow...

411
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,766
Since I'm your bodyguard.

412
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,363
You'll stop at this rate.
I'll do this for you.

413
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,204
Tell me.
Why didn't you tell me about the dementia?

414
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,956
Did you toy with me and my dad?

415
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,583
Why are you looking at her?

416
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,879
Don't tell me she knew everything.

417
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:44,092
Hey. You tell me.

418
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,220
You knew, didn't you?
You were mocking me, weren't you?

419
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,764
-Just a minute. Let go.
-Tell me!

420
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,983
I... Let me take Mr. Nam home first.

421
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,569
Shin, you tell me.

422
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,446
Why are you so friendly with her?

423
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,323
LOW BATTERY

424
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,702
NO SECONDARY BATTERY

425
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:11,870
Shin.

426
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,919
Shin. What's wrong?

427
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,339
What is this?

428
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:27,135
Why does Shin have
something like this?

429
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,813
Did you see?

430
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,566
You...

431
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:45,278
looked shocked when you saw that.

432
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,572
Did I?

433
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:52,327
You know I could've ended you with that...

434
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:55,997
but didn't do it on purpose, right?

435
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,542
We have a history together.

436
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,420
I saved the recording of your voice

437
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,173
saying you want to send me
to a nursing home,

438
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,508
so don't act out anymore.

439
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,218
Let's do better.

440
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:15,642
It was all in the interest of the group.
Don't misunderstand my intentions.

441
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:19,854
The group takes
top priority for you as well.

442
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:24,442
That's why you buried
what happened with Jung-woo.

443
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:29,864
Would it benefit you...

444
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,409
if you brought that up?

445
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,347
This is insane.

446
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:57,767
Shin.

447
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:01,521
Why did Shin...

448
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,982
He got in a big accident
in the Czech Republic.

449
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,819
So why did you go?

450
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,738
You should've stayed by my side.

451
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,156
You idiot.

452
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,926
The rule is to hug you if you cry.

453
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,850
-Shin.
-You're not Shin.

454
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,937
Do you think you could become him
if you wear his clothes and cologne?

455
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:44,897
What? A robot?

456
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,942
How dare you deceive me
when you're not even human?

457
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,569
How dare you be mean to me, a fake?

458
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,197
You disgust me.

459
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:54,741
You make me sick.

460
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:55,825
Ye-na.

461
00:33:55,908 --> 00:33:57,452
You people are worse.

462
00:33:57,952 --> 00:33:59,412
Shin is dying.

463
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,539
What game are you playing?

464
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,874
He's dying?

465
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,168
Does this look like a game to you?

466
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:08,796
Everyone here risked their lives for Shin.

467
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,506
We believe he will wake up,

468
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,342
and we are protecting him
from your father!

469
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,303
He isn't dying!

470
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,985
I'm sorry. I got too worked up.

471
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:41,245
I want to be alone with Shin.

472
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,294
Let's go.

473
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:38,928
Why are you staring at me?

474
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,306
That's the look when humans are worried.

475
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,142
I'm not worried.

476
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:45,893
Are you insane?

477
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,646
Hey, Tin Can.

478
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,317
Don't hug anyone like that.

479
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,530
You should comfort someone
only if they want it.

480
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:01,617
"Comfort someone only if they want it."

481
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:09,041
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

482
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,251
Do you...

483
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,004
need comforting?

484
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,425
You're down because Ms. Suh said
that Nam Shin was dying.

485
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:20,928
Get in the car.

486
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,273
Remember what you said before?

487
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:37,111
That you're confused
whether you like Shin or what he has.

488
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,532
I know for sure from today.

489
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,452
You got angry when someone said...

490
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,703
Nam Shin was dying.

491
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,040
You could have everything Shin has

492
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,000
since I look like him,

493
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,961
but you care only about his recovery.

494
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:58,049
That means you like the human Nam Shin.

495
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,843
My analysis is correct, right?

496
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:02,970
You're speaking nonsense again.

497
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,530
When he got into the accident,

498
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,325
someone was following him.

499
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,078
I believe...

500
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:30,498
that Suh Jong-gil sent that man.

501
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,377
What proof do you have?

502
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,128
I don't need proof.

503
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,047
I may be a scientist,

504
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,049
but I trust my motherly instincts.

505
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,301
This is what my instincts
tell me as a daughter.

506
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:44,929
My dad isn't that messed up.

507
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,056
I hope your belief...

508
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,100
is correct.

509
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,606
What is that on his head?

510
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,442
A special ultrasound device.

511
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,112
Someone in a coma woke up by using that.

512
00:38:03,364 --> 00:38:04,448
Shin...

513
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,200
will wake up.

514
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,619
He's my son, so I know.

515
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,871
I'm sure I know him better

516
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:13,332
than his mom who abandoned him.

517
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,294
Aren't you embarrassed

518
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,004
to act like a good mom now?

519
00:38:21,882 --> 00:38:22,925
I'm glad...

520
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:26,554
that you care about him more than I do.

521
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,933
Please make the best decision for him.

522
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:52,705
DAD

523
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,083
Where are you?

524
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:57,918
I can't tell you.

525
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,171
Stop doing this.

526
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,882
You knew the chairman didn't
have dementia, right?

527
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,842
You knew, but you lied to me!

528
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,719
Regardless of his dementia,

529
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,096
your greed was exposed
for everyone to see.

530
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,141
I'm staying with Shin tonight.

531
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:13,142
Are you insane?

532
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,269
Ye-na.

533
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,146
Ye-na!

534
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:18,939
You...

535
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,363
Shin.

536
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,366
What should I do?

537
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:45,841
So-bong. Wake up.

538
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,511
So-bong.

539
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:56,811
Ye-na is gone.

540
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,188
We have to check
if she went to Mr. Suh.

541
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,272
Phone.

542
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:01,816
I'll call him...

543
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,195
-It's Mr. Suh.
-Speakerphone.

544
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,698
Sorry for calling so early.

545
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:11,742
I'm on my way to see the chairman.

546
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,577
Let's meet in his room.

547
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,789
We can't let him see the chairman.

548
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,051
Why didn't you tell me?

549
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,388
What do you mean?

550
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:35,516
When did you plan on telling us?

551
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,726
I told them everything.

552
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,607
Your secret.

553
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,486
-Ye-na.
-Why?

554
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,364
Is it wrong to want
a fixed date for the wedding?

555
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,493
Date for the wedding?

556
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:58,622
You apologized last night
for making me wait.

557
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:01,041
You said we should tell people
and start planning.

558
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,711
I told them.

559
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,713
Grandpa and Dad are both happy about it.

560
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,214
I'm excited too.

561
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,384
Smile.

562
00:41:23,939 --> 00:41:25,107
What's going on?

563
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:32,281
Why did you have to do that?

564
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:38,245
Otherwise, you won't believe
that I'm on Shin's side.

565
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:40,956
He'll be my man in the end now.

566
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,666
So it's not bad for me either.

567
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,630
Here.

568
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,678
You have a ring.
But don't you have a phone?

569
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,349
-What?
-Just one call would have helped everyone.

570
00:41:58,432 --> 00:42:01,185
Your sudden disappearance surprised them.

571
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,730
Ye-na, are you one of those
who seek attention?

572
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:05,981
How dare you?

573
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:11,237
I invited journalists to the company,
so put that on.

574
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,989
You'd better be a good actor
in front of them.

575
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,749
So she's getting married
in order to keep the secret?

576
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:26,961
Yes, I guess I'll listen to her for now.

577
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,506
What you just said was quite funny.

578
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,299
It was so satisfying.

579
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:35,636
But don't upset Mr. Suh too much.

580
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,222
I need to drive the chairman somewhere.

581
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:39,682
Take care of him.

582
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:40,808
Okay.

583
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,732
Put that ring on.

584
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,901
You should pretend you're married.

585
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,536
So Ye-na is getting married.

586
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,871
Does that mean you're bending to my will?

587
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:06,166
Yes. I'll be Shin's father-in-law.

588
00:43:06,542 --> 00:43:07,876
I promise I won't make trouble.

589
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:09,712
Thank you.

590
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,924
We're on the same team after all.

591
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:17,428
Whatever that means.

592
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,599
I was too hasty.

593
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,560
I promise I will never...

594
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,438
mention Jung-woo again.

595
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,541
Are you going to just watch Mr. Suh?

596
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:52,546
Why did you ask me to edit
his voice from the file?

597
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,424
With that, you can easily cut him out.

598
00:43:55,507 --> 00:43:57,468
He won't just give up if I do that.

599
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,056
If someone like him really wants
to do something,

600
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,017
no one can stop him.

601
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:08,771
The world is not that simple.

602
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,565
Rather than dismissing him out right now,

603
00:44:11,774 --> 00:44:14,526
it's more beneficial for me to show him...

604
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:16,987
I can dismiss him any time.

605
00:44:18,113 --> 00:44:19,490
There he comes!

606
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,460
Mr. Nam.

607
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,837
-Please tell us.
-Why did you do that?

608
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:35,214
Please say something.

609
00:44:35,297 --> 00:44:37,091
-Mr. Nam.
-Please say something.

610
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,134
-Please see here.
-What's the reason?

611
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,678
Please say a few words.

612
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:43,472
-Could you look over here?
-Please say something.

613
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,849
-Mr. Nam.
-Why did you do that?

614
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,937
Please say something.

615
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:53,857
-When is the wedding day?
-Tell us how you feel.

616
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:56,110
What will happen to PK Group
after the wedding?

617
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,945
-Strike a pose.
-Please look over here.

618
00:44:58,028 --> 00:44:59,988
-Please say a few words.
-How do you feel?

619
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:02,991
-Please say something.
-Mr. Nam.

620
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:04,576
Are you going to have babies?

621
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,995
Please strike a pose.

622
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:09,206
-Mr. Nam.
-Look over here.

623
00:45:09,289 --> 00:45:11,750
-Please tell us.
-What are your plans?

624
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,252
Please look here.

625
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,046
What's going on?
Why are they suddenly getting married?

626
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,882
Engaged couples getting
married is nothing new.

627
00:45:19,007 --> 00:45:20,718
-Why are you surprised?
-Mr. Nam.

628
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,428
Where are you going to live?

629
00:45:22,511 --> 00:45:23,512
Please look here.

630
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,598
-When is your wedding day?
-Look here, Mr. Nam.

631
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,058
Could you please answer that?

632
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:43,699
Go stand in a corner.
Don't talk, and don't move.

633
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:54,418
Don't look at me. Look at the wall.

634
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,420
You have his face, and it disgusts me.

635
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,051
Now, it's better.

636
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,099
Until when should I be
doing this? Seriously.

637
00:46:13,061 --> 00:46:14,688
Do you have to do this?

638
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,024
It's too much.

639
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:18,484
What is too much?

640
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:21,111
Should I care about his feelings too?

641
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,780
After all he has done to me?

642
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:28,035
He didn't do anything wrong.
Go easy on him.

643
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,376
I have to go to the restroom.

644
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:51,475
I'm stopping by my room. Stay there.

645
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:07,157
An emergency room?

646
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:09,785
Exactly. You said you saw someone

647
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:12,913
who looked exactly like Mr. Nam
in front of the emergency room.

648
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:16,375
But you said I must have mistaken him.

649
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,628
Is there anything else you remember?

650
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:23,674
Well, it's been a long time.

651
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,221
-Why do you ask that?
-It's none of your business.

652
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:34,059
Why did Shin suddenly
change his mind to get married?

653
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:38,063
He wouldn't share such things with me.

654
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:39,815
You know how he is.

655
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:42,025
He doesn't talk to me unless necessary.

656
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:45,070
You don't know anything, do you?

657
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,446
So-bong?

658
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,449
I'll talk to you later.

659
00:47:58,208 --> 00:48:00,586
You wanted to go to the restroom.
Why are you here?

660
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,548
He's not in the room.

661
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,425
Pardon?

662
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,389
You jerk!

663
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:16,602
-Did you play with my daughter's heart?
-Who is he?

664
00:48:17,185 --> 00:48:19,688
Don't touch me.

665
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:23,483
I know him. I'll take care of him.

666
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,193
-Seriously.
-Get off me!

667
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,451
Are you listening to me?

668
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,536
Get off me. Let go.

669
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:37,915
Dad, have you lost your mind?
What are you doing?

670
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,583
You stay out of this!

671
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:42,586
What's wrong with you?
You kissed my daughter...

672
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:45,297
and get married to another woman?
How dare you!

673
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:48,592
If a man kisses a woman,
he should marry her.

674
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:52,095
It was her first kiss.
You shouldn't hurt her.

675
00:48:52,387 --> 00:48:54,097
Was it really your first kiss?

676
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:55,974
Who said it was my first kiss?

677
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,310
Be quiet! What if someone hears this?

678
00:48:58,393 --> 00:48:59,770
They should hear it!

679
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,397
You have ears to hear things.

680
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,232
Everyone!

681
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:07,861
This man kissed my daughter!

682
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:09,529
What are you talking about?

683
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:13,241
It just happened. It's like an accident.

684
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,744
Neither of us have feelings
for each other.

685
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,505
Since when were you such a cool person?

686
00:49:27,005 --> 00:49:30,008
You kissed a guy you don't even love...

687
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,932
Why? What is this?

688
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,227
This is scaring me! I'm scared of heights!

689
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,395
You brought him here?

690
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,355
Get off me!

691
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,819
What are you? Why are you so strong?

692
00:49:49,528 --> 00:49:52,489
You have money, connections,
and muscles too?

693
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,993
Where do you work out, you brat?

694
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,253
What is he doing?
What's wrong with him?

695
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:09,965
What in the world is going on?

696
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:13,552
It was an accident,
but I understand that it upset you.

697
00:50:14,302 --> 00:50:16,096
Please beat me until you feel better.

698
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,390
-How dare you...
-Let me beat him.

699
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,517
Don't you think of defending yourself.

700
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:24,271
Don't. Beating a rich man could
get you in trouble.

701
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:36,950
Seriously...

702
00:50:38,910 --> 00:50:42,581
Do you seriously have no feelings
for her at all?

703
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,459
I don't have feelings.

704
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:47,627
You can say you don't like her
if you don't.

705
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,213
How can a human not have feelings?

706
00:50:51,882 --> 00:50:55,052
I know my daughter
won't become Cinderella...

707
00:50:55,135 --> 00:50:57,345
just because she kissed a rich man.

708
00:50:57,679 --> 00:51:00,015
Even if she does, I will stop her.

709
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:03,769
But how can a human have no feelings?

710
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,230
You're such a cold person.

711
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:15,489
My daughter will quit the job,
so keep that in mind.

712
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:17,532
No.

713
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:24,998
I'm sorry...

714
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,459
that I can't tell you everything.

715
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,589
But So-bong is a good human being.

716
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:36,051
She knows all about me,
but won't run away.

717
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,719
She won't tell my secret either.

718
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:40,889
Just like So-bong protects me,

719
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,183
I must protect her too.

720
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,062
What's going on between you two?

721
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:49,648
That sounds like he's saying he likes you.

722
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,192
Whatever.

723
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,279
I can't tell if you are a real jerk...

724
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,906
or overly honest.

725
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:00,784
Keep your promise.

726
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,787
If you hurt my daughter, I'll be back.

727
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:06,081
I'll come again, again,

728
00:52:06,164 --> 00:52:07,124
and again!

729
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:10,168
Let's go.

730
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,964
I called a car. Please take this home.

731
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:18,135
It's okay. We'll cab it...

732
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,137
Come on. Just get in.

733
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,180
-I'm sitting shotgun.
-But...

734
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,890
-Hey. Let go.
-Get in.

735
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:27,227
-But...
-I'm going, too. Later.

736
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,984
-Move over.
-What is this? Why?

737
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,996
What are you waiting for?
Ms. Suh is waiting.

738
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:01,803
NAM JUNG-WOO

739
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,800
People would be mistaken and think...

740
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:43,887
that old man was a loving father.

741
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,700
It's been a while.

742
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,726
But So-bong is a good human being.

743
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,688
She knows all about me,
but won't run away.

744
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,023
She won't tell my secret either.

745
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,734
Just like So-bong protects me,

746
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,861
I must protect her too.

747
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:51,454
Ms. Suh, are you uncomfortable?

748
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,081
Should I open the window?

749
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:55,542
Don't mind me, and just drive.

750
00:54:58,086 --> 00:54:59,462
Don't open the window.

751
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:02,173
If people see,
I'll need to put on an act with you.

752
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:03,883
Shin is lying in bed.

753
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,552
I don't want to laugh with you.

754
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,680
Mr. Nam, please close the window.

755
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:16,688
What's your problem?

756
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:18,440
Why do you listen only to her?

757
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:19,649
Calm down, Ye-na.

758
00:55:19,858 --> 00:55:21,026
"Ye-na"?

759
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,405
Take that ring off.

760
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:28,366
Take it off.

761
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:30,869
Stop it, Ms. Suh.

762
00:55:30,952 --> 00:55:32,037
I told you to take it off.

763
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:41,171
Shin will wake up soon.

764
00:55:41,338 --> 00:55:42,630
Once he does,

765
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:44,924
I'll melt you down in a furnace.

766
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:46,384
Ms. Suh!

767
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,267
Why won't you listen?

768
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,810
I'm the human Nam Shin right now.

769
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,754
-What are you doing?
-What?

770
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,807
First, you make him face a wall.
Now, you remove his battery?

771
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,350
You've gone too far!

772
00:56:35,433 --> 00:56:36,893
What's the big deal?

773
00:56:36,976 --> 00:56:38,895
I'll put it back on him when we get off.

774
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,189
He isn't just an object.

775
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:44,192
He has a brain and he understands
human emotions!

776
00:56:44,776 --> 00:56:46,736
If it isn't an object,  what is it?
A human?

777
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,489
You're weird.

778
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,992
Did you develop feelings
for a robot after kissing it?

779
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,161
-What?
-Why?

780
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:59,082
Do you feel like you're with an heir
if you're with it?

781
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,232
Tin Can.

782
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:27,694
If you let just anyone touch
your battery, you're dead.

783
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,615
-Hey.
-What?

784
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:34,492
Come with me. Right now.

785
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:54,262
Let just anyone touch it, and he's dead?

786
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:55,680
Am I "just anyone"?

787
00:57:56,598 --> 00:57:58,975
Who are you to disrespect me?
How dare you?

788
00:58:00,143 --> 00:58:02,187
You're allowed to disrespect others,
but I can't?

789
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,190
Give me a break. You're useless
without Daddy and Shin.

790
00:58:05,273 --> 00:58:06,483
Why you...

791
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,656
Let go.

792
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:16,784
-Let go of me.
-Why?

793
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,244
So you can hit me again?

794
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:20,705
Do you think I hold back because I'm weak?

795
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:23,958
What? So what if you're strong?

796
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:30,798
Hey.

797
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,848
-What's your deal?
-Don't mistreat So-bong.

798
00:58:38,932 --> 00:58:40,725
Who are you to order me around? Move.

799
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,564
Are you insane?

800
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:48,983
Hey. What's gotten into you?

801
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:11,256
Protecting Kang So-bong...

802
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,050
is top priority from now on.

803
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:43,162
Make sure Young-hoon
doesn't become like Jong-gil.

804
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,164
I'm warning you. Don't cross the line.

805
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:48,543
-Take it.
What's going on?

806
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:50,336
I told you I didn't want to.

807
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,380
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry for what?

808
00:59:52,630 --> 00:59:53,840
I told you to do it.

809
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,466
Why did you do that earlier?

810
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:56,884
Why are you playing that?

811
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:59,470
How would it have been if I were human?

812
01:00:00,930 --> 01:00:02,932
