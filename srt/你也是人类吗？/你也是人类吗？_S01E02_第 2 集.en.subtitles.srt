1
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,657
This human looks just like me.

2
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:22,165
I just spotted him
46 minutes 43 seconds ago.

3
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,375
MATCH

4
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,028
You guys are twins!

5
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,865
You both are handsome. Who's older?

6
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:13,800
NAME: NAM SHIN
AGE: 28, PK GROUP'S GRANDSON

7
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,260
Nam Shin.

8
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,515
I'm also Nam Shin.

9
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,371
SEARCHING
NO DATA

10
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,584
You should protect the life.

11
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,753
Save first, think later.

12
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,745
-Hello.
-Hello.

13
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:28,958
Thank you.

14
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,752
Thank you.

15
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,421
Please help saving the earth.

16
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,545
What does it mean to have...

17
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,798
the same name and face?

18
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:05,305
Who the heck are you?

19
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:44,761
Shin.

20
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,388
Shin.

21
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:51,392
It's me, your mother. Open your eyes.

22
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,311
Shin.

23
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:54,479
I now know.

24
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:56,856
That's human Nam Shin.

25
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,943
He's my mother's son.

26
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,991
Shin, it's me, your mother.

27
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,083
I hug when she cries.

28
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:16,250
Not now.

29
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,044
Get out of here before anyone sees.

30
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:28,930
Shin.

31
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,435
Please open your eyes. I'm your mother.

32
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,896
Shin.

33
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:41,526
You mother is right here.

34
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,070
Please open your eyes.

35
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,572
Shin.

36
00:06:48,157 --> 00:06:50,660
Please.

37
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,873
Shin...

38
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,469
I couldn't give Mom the flowers.

39
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,681
It's okay.
We can give them to her anytime.

40
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,688
I saw another man tailing human Nam Shin.

41
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,482
-He had a gun.
-What?

42
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:14,285
Guess who I saw?
There was someone who looks just like--

43
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:35,848
Good. Please come back
before you get caught.

44
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:39,560
It's all done.

45
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,948
Dad is insisting to go to work.
Bring Shin right away.

46
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,117
You went to find Shin, right?
Call me.

47
00:08:55,535 --> 00:09:00,206
Is it true that the director will
do the presentation?

48
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:04,752
Hello?

49
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:07,004
Open up!

50
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:13,344
I know you're here.
I know you're here to see your mother.

51
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:26,691
Who are you?

52
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,526
Are you serious?

53
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,237
How did I find you?

54
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:35,616
I searched all the hotels and your calls
to the private investigator.

55
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,035
Do you have any idea
what's going on at work?

56
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,079
Of course not.

57
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,748
I'm Nam Shin, but not that Nam Shin.

58
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:44,750
Are you crazy?

59
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,087
-The president has dementia--
-Don't misunderstand.

60
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:49,964
I'm not human.

61
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:53,926
What?

62
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,546
Who are you?

63
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,215
-Why are you here--
-I know him.

64
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:36,010
He's a new assistant,
Shin's only close friend.

65
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:02,328
How is he?

66
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,206
The bleeding has stopped, but...

67
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,084
he could suffer from edema.

68
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,461
I don't know when he'll wake up.

69
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,008
Did you find the truck driver?

70
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:18,177
We did, but he was already dead.

71
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,055
Shot in the head.

72
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,890
Something is going on.

73
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,684
I just need Shin next to me.

74
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,146
We've been apart for 20 years
because of that old man with dementia.

75
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,025
He even got into a car accident
in front of me.

76
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,820
I'll take care of him.

77
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,489
If Director Suh finds this out...

78
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,536
Who? Suh Jong-gil?

79
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,037
You know him well.

80
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:48,749
If he knows his condition,
he'll do anything to kill him.

81
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,210
It will endanger him even more.

82
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,629
Suh Jong-gil.

83
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,717
He killed my husband,
and now my son.

84
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:00,803
Shin can stop this.

85
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,431
We need Shin back.

86
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:10,396
There's no way.

87
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:19,155
There's no trace of that man
who was tailing Shin.

88
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,367
-You didn't get anything either?
-Right, no data.

89
00:12:24,994 --> 00:12:27,538
Let's keep it a secret from Mom.

90
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,832
She has too much going on already.

91
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,759
How's your human son doing?

92
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,803
Shin.

93
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:45,431
I have a favor to ask. 

94
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:52,772
What is it? You look so serious.

95
00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,192
Please go to Seoul

96
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,029
and keep Shin's place.

97
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,324
Seoul? What are you saying?

98
00:13:05,409 --> 00:13:11,081
You're sending him to Seoul
instead of your real son?

99
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,501
Are you insane?

100
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,257
I'll do as you say.

101
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,217
Hey.

102
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,145
Thank you.

103
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:37,608
I'm sorry.

104
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:48,911
Don't be sad.

105
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:53,767
Shin doesn't bow back.

106
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,603
-Why not?
-He's cocky.

107
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,063
Chin up, look down.

108
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,401
Let's try something else.

109
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:20,419
He avoids the president.
He doesn't talk much.

110
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:39,355
The director is our enemy
but your fiancée's father.

111
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,775
You can greet him.

112
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,752
Ye-na is like your sister.

113
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,964
No touching.

114
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,895
He doesn't button up.

115
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,689
Now you really look like Shin.

116
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,192
Even I get confused.

117
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:57,117
MRI, CT, brainwave, blood test.

118
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,329
We've looked through again.

119
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:05,250
It is the early stage of Alzheimer's.

120
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,170
You have to continue to take the medicine.

121
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:14,968
I will, but let me do the presentation
myself.

122
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,471
Are you out of your mind?

123
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,933
Do you want to advertise
that you have Alzheimer's?

124
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,978
You'll look for Jung-woo
in front of Director Suh again.

125
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:26,313
Be quiet.

126
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,690
She's right.

127
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,028
I think you should let him
do the presentation.

128
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:35,489
He's too lucky to have that chance.

129
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:40,244
It's all because of Shin!

130
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:52,381
Is this okay so far?

131
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:55,050
Yes, right there is fine.

132
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,637
When you finish your sentence
the self-driving car will come in.

133
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:04,143
Why don't you be in that car
when you come out, sir?

134
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,688
I think our plan is more dramatic.

135
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:12,109
But we should put all the spotlights
on him

136
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,028
to help with the presentation.

137
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,908
Is the main presentation about him
or the self-driving car?

138
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,829
Let's go with the first plan.

139
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,622
Sure.

140
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,125
Let's do some more adjustments.

141
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:40,971
How do I look?

142
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:43,682
Looks cool, right?

143
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:48,520
Sorry to break it to you,
but I wish it was Shin looking cool.

144
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,480
Not you.

145
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,692
I'm going to him.

146
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:57,946
What?

147
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:01,450
Did Shin call you?

148
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,953
I managed to find out
Young-hoon's business trip destination.

149
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:07,539
He must have gone to bring him back.

150
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:09,124
I'll help him out.

151
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,002
Oh, sure. Bring him quickly.

152
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:15,714
So I don't feel all this pressure on me.

153
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,467
Let me know if you need anything.

154
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,676
Sure, will do.

155
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,013
My bags should be here by now.
Bye.

156
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,277
What?

157
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:40,864
I'll just ask once.
Why did you get fired from the PK Group?

158
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,325
That's because...

159
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,453
He hit you for secretively taking
his picture, right?

160
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,958
You took out that part from your CV.

161
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,710
Do you think we're
that much of a pushover?

162
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:57,547
You told me to work from today.

163
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:00,217
I can work 7 days, not 5 days.

164
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,386
I also don't need an employee discount.

165
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:06,139
Why? Will you sell the pictures
of our VIPs?

166
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:11,186
What can I do to earn your trust?
I can write a contract.

167
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,854
I can bet my hands on it.

168
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:20,821
Up! Get out now!

169
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,615
Just bite the ear. Or poke the eyes.

170
00:21:25,617 --> 00:21:28,745
When the referee isn't looking
that's when you cheat.

171
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,375
Go on.

172
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,132
You come out.

173
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,635
Give me my soju back. Come on.

174
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:54,062
I thought it was your first day.
Why are you back?

175
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,524
Did you make trouble again?

176
00:21:57,607 --> 00:22:01,695
Is it a hidden camera
from the mall's restroom this time?

177
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:07,159
Stop it. I got fired for that
and won't be able to work at all.

178
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,161
So are you sad?

179
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:13,123
What kind of security takes
a photo with a hidden camera?

180
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,584
How many times do I have to tell you?
I won't do it again.

181
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:19,838
How can I trust you when you tell
the students to cheat?

182
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,673
What does that have to do with this?

183
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,050
A lot!

184
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,637
Once you become trash,
you stay trash.

185
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:30,390
What? Trash?

186
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,145
Fine.

187
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:41,276
I'll sue that jerk and get the money.
I endured it for you, but I won't anymore.

188
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,446
What, again?

189
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,576
Sue me, too for raising a girl like you.

190
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:51,620
Get out of the way.

191
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:08,720
PK GROUP

192
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,100
PK GROUP

193
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,897
There's nothing but PK Group around you.

194
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,274
Is Korea a PK Group or something?

195
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,779
What kind of global group
tries to block my career?

196
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:28,782
I'm sorry.

197
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:34,329
Stop it, I'm talking about PK, not you.

198
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,207
Hey.

199
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:42,504
I knelt down on the street
in the middle of Hong-dae.

200
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,592
I have a confession.

201
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:50,178
That hidden camera...

202
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:52,973
was Nam Shin's idea!

203
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,349
What did you say?

204
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:59,771
He wanted to make himself
look like trash, so he used you.

205
00:24:00,063 --> 00:24:04,734
And all the money you got was from him.

206
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:09,573
He just beat me like that
knowing about the camera?

207
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:13,827
That was all show. I was surprised too.

208
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:15,912
Who is this jerk?

209
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,082
I'm barging into PK Group.

210
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,667
Wait, please don't.

211
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:24,254
You're also out of my life. Bye!

212
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,018
Hello? Where are you? You okay?

213
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:41,146
Just drink up and feel better.

214
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:45,525
I'll buy you beer and beef.
I just need to borrow both of you.

215
00:24:57,287 --> 00:25:03,460
The self-driving car project was planned
and carried out by Nam Shin.

216
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,464
Due to personal issues,
I'm here on behalf of him.

217
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:12,052
I'm PK Group's Director, Suh Jung-gil.

218
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,481
PK MOTORS

219
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:32,572
The 4th industrial revolution is a magical
change that turns imagination to reality.

220
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:39,454
PK Group would like to start that magic
with this self-driving car.

221
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,875
It drives by itself.

222
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,087
It helps humans to rest.

223
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:51,508
Introducing The M Car.

224
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:49,065
As you can see,
there's no one in the driver's seat.

225
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,569
Of course, none in the back either.

226
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,198
-I'm sorry, I'm late.
-Oh, my.

227
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,159
Are you crazy?

228
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:44,704
I'm sorry.
He wanted a dramatic appearance.

229
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:55,131
KIM MYUNG-HO, CHA SANG-HYUNG
SUH JONG-GIL'S RIGHT/LEFT HAND

230
00:27:56,132 --> 00:28:00,220
NAM HO-YUN, FASHION DIRECTOR, ENEMY
NAM GUN-HO, PK GROUP PRESIDENT

231
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,263
SUH JONG-GIL, GENERAL DIRECTOR
EAGER TO TAKE OVER

232
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,183
Director.

233
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:11,481
Thanks for all your work.
I'll take it from here, please enjoy.

234
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:17,404
Please give a round of applause
for the director.

235
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,009
I'm glad I made it on time.

236
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,595
I'll do the rest of the presentation.

237
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,349
I am Nam Shin, the General Manager
of Future Development.

238
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,733
SELF-DRIVING CAR
NEW INTRODUCTION

239
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:57,986
I'M NOT THE SWINDLER HERE.
STOP THIS ACT AND APOLOGIZE, SHIN.

240
00:28:58,153 --> 00:29:01,072
HE USED HIS POWERLESS EMPLOYEE.

241
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:09,664
How long do we have to do this?
My arms hurt!

242
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,793
Do they hurt already, Joint?

243
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,880
Don't call me that.
My name is Jo In-Tae.

244
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,673
Don't be a weak baby.

245
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,508
I'm good.

246
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,051
I'm the robot cop.

247
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:27,766
So-bong.
You're too much, just go.

248
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:32,604
So-bong, please stop.
If Shin sees this, it's even more trouble.

249
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:35,815
What? That jerk is inside there?

250
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:41,112
This car doesn't feel anger,
compulsion nor fatigue.

251
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:47,243
It doesn't drink and drive,
have road rage, or nod off at the wheel.

252
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:52,248
You can watch movies, shop,

253
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:56,711
or love your lover
like you've seen it on TV in the car.

254
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,590
Just don't forget the window
is in manner mode.

255
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:08,598
When there's a car accident,
what should we do?

256
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,310
Accident?

257
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:14,604
Why would you ask him
that hard question?

258
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:19,067
Before a journalist asks,
it's better we clear it up.

259
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,491
Let's say the car is going
into a narrow street.

260
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:31,120
And there are two motorcycles
coming from the opposite side.

261
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:36,626
One rider is wearing a helmet,
another one isn't.

262
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:42,674
If a crash is inevitable,
which rider does the car hit?

263
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:49,848
It should be the one with the helmet
as he or she will get hurt less.

264
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:54,435
But that's the one who followed the rules.
It's not fair.

265
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,772
I think it should be the one
without the helmet.

266
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:06,072
Mr. Nam, which decision should we make?

267
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,293
That's hard.

268
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:24,465
Should we decide it with rock,
paper, scissors?

269
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,393
Let me rephrase the question.

270
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:42,692
What if the helmet rider is 100 years old.
And the one without is in his teens.

271
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:47,572
The teen should die because
he didn't abide by the law?

272
00:31:56,247 --> 00:32:02,003
Which life to save, the decision
is in human's hands.

273
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:07,050
Now humans are within the reach
of God's control, deciding people's lives.

274
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:11,012
God has given us destiny
and coincidence so far.

275
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:16,893
But PK Group will be the one
that wins over any human decisions.

276
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:22,023
PK's godly upgrade
to a different level starts with...

277
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,817
this M Car.

278
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:53,638
You jerk!

279
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:03,815
President...

280
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:06,317
Isn't she the one who got hit by him?

281
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:09,904
-I'll get help.
-Let Shin take care of it.

282
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:24,836
You made me take the pictures. And you
hit me even though you knew about it.

283
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:26,879
I did?

284
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,090
Don't pretend you don't know.

285
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,634
Are you going to deny it like this?

286
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,597
SEARCHING

287
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,733
I kept quiet because
I did the wrong thing.

288
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:49,777
I sucked it up when everyone
treated me like garbage and fired me.

289
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,282
Then I heard you played me.

290
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:57,535
Am I some toy for you to use like that?

291
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,831
How fun was it for you?

292
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:05,293
It must have been fun watching me
run around without knowing anything.

293
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,450
If you cry, I hug.

294
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:59,347
Why are you blanking out?
Did you get hit again?

295
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:03,976
What did those crazy people do to you?

296
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:05,728
I'll go and...

297
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,106
You go home.

298
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,233
I'll call you later.

299
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:13,653
You didn't see him?
What did you do inside?

300
00:35:14,237 --> 00:35:16,239
I'm sorry but...

301
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:21,661
whether you met him or not
where's the beef you promised?

302
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:25,957
Beef my ass, go away!

303
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:30,336
Do you want to be on the fire
with the beef?

304
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,963
You told me you'd treat us.

305
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,841
If you had shut your mouth,
we'd have eaten it.

306
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,388
Hug when you cry?

307
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,974
Pretending to be an angel?

308
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:49,063
Oh, I see. Now you're using me
to change your public image?

309
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,324
Wait!

310
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,040
It was a touching moment to see
your reconciliation with that lady.

311
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,625
Was it planned?

312
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:15,089
No way. He's been regretting it a lot.

313
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,677
He's acting weird.

314
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,681
He never hugs anyone.

315
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,684
He must have grown up this time.

316
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:32,273
No way. Humans don't change that easily.

317
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,747
You always act how you want.

318
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,624
Why didn't you hide longer?

319
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,252
You should've come back after I'm dead.

320
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,255
Avoid the president.
Shin doesn't talk to him much.

321
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,467
What was that cute show all about?

322
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,511
What a hypocrite.

323
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:03,763
Sneer at her.

324
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,059
You're also a hypocrite
in front of grandfather.

325
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,310
What?

326
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:13,689
It's a big day, no need to fight today.

327
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:24,075
Welcome back, Shin.

328
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,787
It means it's a lie.

329
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,706
The sensor in your hands will read
a person's heart beat,

330
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,794
breathing pattern and blood pressure
to figure out if that person is lying.

331
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:37,630
The lie detector is an addition.

332
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,632
It's a lie when I wink.

333
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,008
Yes.

334
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,886
People lie, although it seems
like they are telling the truth.

335
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:48,349
Don't get fooled by people
like Suh Jong-gil.

336
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:51,560
What a lie.

337
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:57,233
You didn't want Shin to come back.
I know it, I have a lie detector.

338
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,734
Mr. Nam...

339
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,444
A lie detector?

340
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:05,741
What an interesting way
to make me laugh.

341
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:07,285
Shin.

342
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,287
Be careful what you say.

343
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:16,627
I must have wronged him in some way.

344
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,463
For him to make such a joke to me.

345
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:23,509
That was a bit over the line, Mr. Shin.

346
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,866
Seoul has changed a lot.

347
00:38:47,533 --> 00:38:50,995
You must have been gone for a long time.
Why didn't you visit your hometown?

348
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:00,087
I'm here now. Where's Shin?

349
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:03,299
You should focus on the other Shin.

350
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,509
Make sure he's okay
with the new environment.

351
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,596
Okay, hanging up.

352
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,606
I'm sorry for you,
you're in a new environment, too.

353
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:20,983
Wake up already.

354
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:25,071
Before everyone gets
into bigger troubles.

355
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,507
Get up.

356
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,843
I'm sorry.

357
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:51,555
Do you even realize
what you've done to me?

358
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:52,473
I'm sorry.

359
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:55,101
Find out what and how it went wrong.

360
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:59,855
If that killer betrayed us, find him
and cut him into pieces.

361
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:04,235
He's been working for you for a long time.

362
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:05,986
He wouldn't--

363
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:10,658
If he didn't betrayed me, why is he alive
after being hit by the truck?

364
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:17,206
Then he came back alive
to embarrass me in front of everyone.

365
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:21,961
I'm sorry, I will double check.

366
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:31,303
You mentioned that there's something
Shin can't find out.

367
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,515
Do you think he might have come back
after finding that out?

368
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:39,145
His route in Czech has nothing to do
with that.

369
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:43,691
Isn't it about his father?

370
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,530
-I'm sorry.
-Don't you dare ask questions.

371
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,199
Just go check with that killer.

372
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:53,492
Yes, sir.

373
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:24,190
Don't smile like that.

374
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:27,985
Hugging So-bong and talking
about the lie detector were dangerous.

375
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,821
-If you cry, I hug--
-I know it.

376
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:32,740
But why are you here?

377
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,784
Because Mother asked me to come.

378
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,369
She asked you to become the real Shin.

379
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:40,789
You said your mother is your top priority.

380
00:41:41,248 --> 00:41:44,001
You can't be caught as a robot
for the sake of your mother.

381
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:48,255
Especially in front of them. Am I right?

382
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:02,686
You did fairly well today.

383
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:07,149
Thanks for doing as I taught you.

384
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,238
You know how to smile.

385
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:21,872
I guess I can relax now. I feel relieved.

386
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,587
Dr. Oh Laura should be here by now.

387
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:30,881
Really?

388
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,175
I'll call the car, go and meet her.

389
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,470
I'll finish up the rest here.

390
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,222
Let's go.

391
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:39,265
Sure.

392
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:45,396
It's really you.

393
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:46,981
My Shin.

394
00:42:48,357 --> 00:42:50,484
Where are you going?
I want to go with you.

395
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,822
Was it really Shin?

396
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,661
Don't follow me.

397
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:09,253
Please, let's talk. Just once.

398
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:15,301
Do you want some more?
Which type of attack do you want?

399
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,427
No, no.

400
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:23,851
With my journalist name tag,
we can go meet Shin at the reception.

401
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,146
So you'll be off the blacklist.

402
00:43:29,898 --> 00:43:33,402
Don't forgive me.
You don't have to see me again.

403
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:39,325
But I need to make sure
you're working again, so I feel better.

404
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:44,622
I will also give you all the money
I got from Shin.

405
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,377
What if Shin denies you as well?

406
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,550
Just follow me.

407
00:44:49,561 --> 00:44:51,188
Stop drooling.

408
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,136
You never change.

409
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:24,847
You cherish me too much.

410
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:27,391
You're like my sister.

411
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:30,853
Don't worry,
I'll be your sister-like wife.

412
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:35,274
Stop having pictures taken of you
with other girls. Let's get married.

413
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:36,942
No.

414
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:38,444
Never.

415
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:40,028
No?

416
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:41,780
Why not?

417
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,159
Which girl are you looking at this time?

418
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:51,081
CLUB IN BRAZIL ON FIRE,
THE CAUSE WAS THE FIREWORKS

419
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:54,001
No fireworks. It's dangerous.

420
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:57,713
Okay, you stay here.

421
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,382
I'll go talk to them.

422
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:15,773
I'm old enough to know
that you don't play with fire.

423
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:20,444
This is what all clubs are doing.
Get out, you wrinkly old lady.

424
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,577
Don't.

425
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:31,121
Let it go.

426
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:50,516
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

427
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:52,100
You're the crazy one.

428
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:55,187
Why are you even here, you swindler?

429
00:46:55,270 --> 00:46:56,605
What did you call me?

430
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:01,109
I'm here to see someone.

431
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:04,279
I'm sure that's Shin.

432
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,281
Who the heck are you to--

433
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,785
I'm the Marketing Lead of PK Group.
And Shin's fiancée.

434
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,455
Oh, you're that pushover

435
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,250
who's fine with everything
her boyfriend does, even cheating.

436
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,417
Pushover?

437
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:21,088
You'll never see him. Get out.

438
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,298
Who are you to tell me that?
You're only the fiancée.

439
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,884
You can break up at any time.

440
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,011
What...

441
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:30,180
Stop making stories up.

442
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:32,266
He did plan it, he played me.

443
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,477
Don't blame us that you got fired
for your wrongdoing. 

444
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:39,606
I'm not blaming anyone.
Let me check, bring him in.

445
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,193
Mr. Nam?

446
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:47,698
Who are you?

447
00:47:50,450 --> 00:47:51,535
Journalist Jo.

448
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:53,662
You know me.

449
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,876
I knew it.

450
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:01,295
I told you, he'd deny you.

451
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:05,966
I knew it. He says he doesn't know you.
Stop fooling around.

452
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:08,093
Are you Journalist Jo?

453
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,219
Yes.

454
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,305
-Let's talk.
-What?

455
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,523
I know all about Shin,
but I've never seen you.

456
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:11,657
You said it's absolutely secret
and sounded like you weren't coming back.

457
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,451
Why are you back here?

458
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:20,248
You did well before pretending
that you don't know me.

459
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:25,879
The world will be fussy about you
again if they knew about our plan.

460
00:49:27,214 --> 00:49:31,051
But think about poor So-bong.

461
00:49:31,134 --> 00:49:35,389
She's a scapegoat.
Please let her work, at least.

462
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:37,975
I'll take care of it.

463
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:39,893
Here's more.

464
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,301
You little...

465
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:16,013
What?

466
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:18,724
What?

467
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:21,518
Who do you think you are, anyway?

468
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,314
Fire!

469
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:28,942
It's fire.

470
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,403
Fire!

471
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,785
Fire!

472
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,749
Fire! Come out quickly!

473
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:36,051
Save us!

474
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:39,471
-Let us out!
-Excuse me.

475
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,099
I'll do it.

476
00:51:46,311 --> 00:51:48,480
What are you doing? Stop!

477
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,608
It's not here. Get out the other way.

478
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:56,279
Wait, my phone. It's in the restroom.

479
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:59,157
You can't go back there again.

480
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,867
Use this and go.

481
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:27,519
Hurry up!

482
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,866
Hurry, go!

483
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,710
I think we should go now.

484
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:39,132
Oh, sure, go.

485
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:46,389
Then I'll trust your words
and let So-bong know...

486
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:52,270
There's big fire in front of the building.
Please come out and see.

487
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:15,418
Shin!

488
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:18,296
Where have you been? I thought I'd die.

489
00:54:26,471 --> 00:54:27,889
Are you okay?

490
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:30,183
No, I'm not.

491
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,269
Let's go check up later.

492
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:35,814
Shin.

493
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:39,442
Where is he going?

494
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,905
Slowly.

495
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:47,117
It's dangerous. You can't go in.

496
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:08,722
-He's in crisis mode.
-Crisis mode?

497
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,266
He won't remember anyone
at the moment.

498
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,769
His energy is focused on rescuing people.
Other functions are off.

499
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:28,319
Save me first. They'll all die anyway.

500
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:34,451
What was it?

501
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:37,245
Hurting an ankle won't kill you.
Save yourself.

502
00:57:53,261 --> 00:57:55,430
DAD

503
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:18,448
Don't get it wrong.
It's your heartbeat.

504
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:21,743
I don't have a heart.

505
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:19,676
No one touches Shin.

506
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,804
What is she planning behind my back?

507
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,431
You can't go in.
I said don't go!

508
01:01:29,644 --> 01:01:30,937
This is Shin?

509
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,064
He's totally different.

510
01:01:33,147 --> 01:01:34,691
He doesn't even remember
his comment.

511
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:36,651
Accept me as your security.

512
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:40,279
Nam Shin.

513
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:43,616
You better not get caught.

514
01:01:45,660 --> 01:01:48,246
