1
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,196
Shin.

2
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:32,615
Shin.

3
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:34,534
Are you okay?

4
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,369
Let's go home.

5
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:39,122
I won't go with you,
so don't come back.

6
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:41,875
If you do, I will just die, too.

7
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:45,503
It was the first time I ever lied.

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,921
Shin.

9
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,591
I did as I promised.

10
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:53,219
You won't do anything to my mommy, right?

11
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,555
I won't.

12
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,016
It was okay because it was for Mom.

13
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,566
I'm scared, Mommy.

14
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,152
Mommy.

15
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:13,073
No matter how scary it is, I can take it.

16
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:18,036
-Grandfather.
-That's right.

17
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,414
I hit someone
who is 100 times better than you...

18
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,666
because of you.

19
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,710
I'll keep doing that ,too.

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,170
Like you did today,

21
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:30,131
if you can't hold your temper
and get into fights...

22
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:32,258
or gamble and do drugs...

23
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:34,594
like other people's crazy kids,

24
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,304
you won't pay for it.

25
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,682
Young-hoon will.

26
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,859
Good going.

27
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,503
He's just angry.

28
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,964
I'm fine, Shin.

29
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,968
I grew up well, Mom.

30
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,236
Move.

31
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,947
Let him do as he wants.

32
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:42,078
Regardless,

33
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,831
thank you for everything.

34
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,504
You're the one who broke your promise.

35
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:57,343
I said your mom would be safe...

36
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,971
in exchange for you being here.

37
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,975
Even if you finally find
her and go to her,

38
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:05,602
your mom won't be there anymore...

39
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,273
Since I'll find her before you do.

40
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,445
Go on. Do as you please.

41
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,699
My home...

42
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,706
is here.

43
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,169
At least until you die.

44
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:39,344
That's good.

45
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,980
I'm fine without you now, Mom.

46
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:22,679
-That's enough. Leave.
-What?

47
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,181
I'm not interested in you, so leave.

48
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,851
What a jerk.

49
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,202
Life is pretty fun.

50
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,582
I think it'll cost more
to silence the nurse.

51
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,712
Why did she have to  recognize my face?

52
00:04:57,338 --> 00:05:00,216
She knows for sure
that Jung-woo didn't commit suicide.

53
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,592
Shut it.

54
00:05:02,885 --> 00:05:04,470
Shin is in this house.

55
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,390
I'm sorry.

56
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,058
I was careless.

57
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,609
It's time to stop lying.

58
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,080
Just wait.

59
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:33,875
Something very amusing
will happen soon.

60
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,172
I'll meet Mom and find out the truth.

61
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,175
Oh Laura. Don't you understand?

62
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,177
Laura Oh, in your format.

63
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,640
You said you knew this region.
Why can't you find her?

64
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,933
To be honest,

65
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,895
I've been wanting to find you, too, Mom.

66
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,403
But did you...

67
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:05,031
leave me and make that robot?

68
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:08,785
Without knowing anything...

69
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,204
about how I've lived?

70
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,472
No!

71
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:02,672
Shin.

72
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:09,137
Why are you turning around?

73
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,222
I'm the real Nam Shin.

74
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,766
I'm the real Shin!

75
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,270
A robot...

76
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,480
that looks like Shin?

77
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:23,192
I know exactly where Shin's mom was
and what she did.

78
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,486
When I found out that she made a robot...

79
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:27,530
that looked just like Shin,

80
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,616
I created a foundation...

81
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,368
and sponsored her work.

82
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,622
HR Foundation,
which sponsored the upgrades...

83
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:37,623
is me.

84
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,419
And Shin's mom has no idea.

85
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:49,427
Mr. Chairman. I'm sorry.

86
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,512
Everything is my fault.

87
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:54,557
I brought that robot to replace Shin
after his accident.

88
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,851
Shin had nothing to do with it.

89
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,644
He didn't know anything.

90
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,022
It's okay, Young-hoon.

91
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,193
As you said,

92
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,946
I was always afraid
someone would pass me.

93
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,616
If I can turn a robot
that looks like a human...

94
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,035
into a product that I can market,

95
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:18,789
I thought that no company could
catch up to PK.

96
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,585
But once I saw that robot,

97
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:29,133
I started having a strange thought.

98
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,094
What do you mean?

99
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:34,889
Who is appropriate to succeed me.

100
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,307
Sir.

101
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:38,809
How could you say that?

102
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,646
Shin woke up.

103
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,814
He's fully recovered.

104
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,234
How could you compare
Shin and that robot?

105
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:50,571
Haven't you ever thought
that the robot was better than humans?

106
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,511
Don't cry.

107
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:15,638
I'm fine.

108
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,727
Shin.

109
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,522
What? Do I scare you
because of what I did?

110
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:07,815
No.

111
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,151
Nothing you do can scare me.

112
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:14,780
You must've been
so stressed to have done that.

113
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,449
It breaks my heart.

114
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,243
Don't look at me like some wet puppy.
Give me my phone.

115
00:10:31,255 --> 00:10:32,214
Hi, Young-hoon.

116
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,257
Hi, Shin.

117
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:35,051
I can't stand him anymore.

118
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,678
I'm going back.
I don't care if you get mad.

119
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,888
Let's do that.

120
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:43,684
-What?
-Return to work tomorrow.

121
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:46,437
But we can't swap completely.

122
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,856
You're not fully recovered yet,

123
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,775
so let's have you take turns.

124
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,861
I'll pick you up tomorrow.

125
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:02,328
What did Mr. Ji say?

126
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,080
Did he let you go to work?

127
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,684
It's perfect.

128
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,268
I can't tell at all.

129
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,270
Mom fixed me well.

130
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:32,817
You took this, right?

131
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,738
Shall we give this stupid car to Nam Shin,

132
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:39,240
and walk?

133
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,325
Okay.

134
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,439
Why are you looking at me like that?

135
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:15,276
Are you upset that I broke your son?

136
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,529
Break him more...

137
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,157
if it makes you feel better.

138
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,826
I created him...

139
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,287
because I missed you.

140
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:29,165
You have every right to be offended.

141
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:32,835
I'll do anything to make you feel better.

142
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,503
Drop the act.

143
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:37,089
I know you're doing this for him.

144
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,260
Shin.

145
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:45,264
What must I do to get closer to you?

146
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:48,476
You show up after 20 years
and say you're my mom.

147
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,853
Did you think I'd be happy?

148
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:53,063
Shin.

149
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,690
Please...

150
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,442
You'll do anything for me?

151
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,028
If you want to make me feel better,

152
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,821
wait another 20 years.

153
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,533
Just like I did for you.

154
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,915
Ye-na!

155
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,072
The human Nam Shin must hate
that I'm Nam Shin.

156
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,325
Would it be better
if my name was different?

157
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,998
Why should you lose your name
because of that jerk?

158
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:58,003
Your mom may have made you
to replace that jerk,

159
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,005
but you were Nam Shin since day one,

160
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,590
and you still are.

161
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:04,260
What about your face?

162
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,678
Will you change your face too?

163
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:27,825
Even if you have the same face and name,

164
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:29,451
you're nothing like that jerk.

165
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,371
So don't be discouraged.
Be confident.

166
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,956
Live with your name.

167
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,541
Nam Shin.

168
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,876
Okay.

169
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,336
Nam Shin. Confidently.

170
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,884
That's right. You have
different names. I forgot.

171
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:48,387
You're just Nam Shin.
He is "the jerk, Nam Shin."

172
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,974
I'll go now. Goodnight.

173
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:53,642
Okay. See you tomorrow.

174
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,705
CHAMPION GYM

175
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,958
What? The chairman knows?

176
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,919
How did he...

177
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,422
Were we caught?

178
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,259
He knew everything...

179
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,594
but pretended not to.

180
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,932
It won't hurt him, so don't worry.

181
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,315
But why are you telling me this?

182
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,150
Because something is bugging me.

183
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,028
I can't tell what
the chairman is thinking,

184
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,822
but even if the real Shin comes back,

185
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:51,241
I don't think he'll let that Shin go.

186
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,911
That's absurd.

187
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,746
I agree.

188
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,290
We must get Shin to return to work
as soon as possible.

189
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,584
I'll have them take turns
until he adjusts.

190
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,169
Then...

191
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,254
I'll need your help.

192
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,632
Even if Shin comes,

193
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,384
please stay with him as you do now.

194
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,219
Why should I?

195
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,137
I detest that jerk.

196
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:15,349
You and I have the same objective.

197
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,893
I must protect real Shin,

198
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,229
and you must protect that Shin.

199
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,773
If you help me,

200
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,484
I'll help you all the way as well.

201
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,627
Are we going in together today?

202
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,839
No. Shin is going to the office today.

203
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,340
Shin?

204
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,551
The human Nam Shin?

205
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,177
He is returning for good?

206
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:55,472
I'm going to have him switch
in and out to adjust.

207
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:57,182
The human Nam Shin hates me.

208
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:00,644
What if he hates what I did in his place?

209
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,605
That's for him to deal with.

210
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,358
We got this far thanks to you.

211
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,444
It'll be harder for a while,

212
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,446
but thank you.

213
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,322
Very much.

214
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,578
I'm so glad it ended up how you wanted.

215
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:19,455
Congratulations.

216
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,169
Stay at So-bong's gym today.

217
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,922
See you later.

218
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,851
That's right.

219
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:10,339
Good morning, Grandfather.

220
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,591
Did your mom send you?

221
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:15,803
No. I just came on my own today.

222
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,681
-Why?
-Because I think I should...

223
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:22,559
come and greet you even if I'm scared.

224
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,528
What's wrong, Grandpa?

225
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:36,031
Did you cry for Mommy again?

226
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,491
What?

227
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:43,247
Shin! How long will you cry for Mommy?

228
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,959
I told you not to be weak!

229
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,587
Why won't you listen to Grandfather?

230
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:55,926
Grandpa! I'm not Shin!

231
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,388
I'm Hee-dong!

232
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:24,746
What's wrong?
Was Grandfather being scary again?

233
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,333
He called me "Shin"...

234
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:29,877
and got mad at me.

235
00:19:33,088 --> 00:19:34,631
You must've been surprised.

236
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,384
I brought you a gift, so cheer up.

237
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,763
A gift?

238
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,307
Go to my room this afternoon.

239
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,018
It'll protect you whenever you're scared.

240
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,415
Why did you come here?

241
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,626
Did you pretend to have dementia again?

242
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,794
Why did you call Hee-dong that?

243
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,715
That's right. I was pretending.

244
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:20,260
I pretended to have dementia again.

245
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,431
You're lying.

246
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,059
You really showed signs of dementia?

247
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,310
Let go.

248
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,604
What do you know?

249
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,231
Get out right now!

250
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,900
If you go around saying anything stupid,

251
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:36,401
I'll make you pay!

252
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,320
You need to calm down.

253
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,781
-Your blood pressure and pulse are high.
-Let go!

254
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,534
If you don't want to get caught, be quiet.

255
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,206
I understand you're shocked,

256
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:52,334
but getting upset is bad for your health,

257
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:54,169
so take big breaths slowly.

258
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,285
I won't tell anyone, so don't worry.

259
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:28,996
But you must make a promise, too.

260
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,582
Even if you're scared
and don't want to admit it,

261
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,459
go to the hospital.

262
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,461
I'll take care of it,

263
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,964
so get out.

264
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,478
Hello, Mr. Nam.

265
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,690
-Why is she here?
-I told you.

266
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,525
You'll have to take turns
for a while.

267
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,320
We need her to be with you
to avoid suspicion.

268
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,197
Now, they'll both act arrogant
about helping me.

269
00:22:05,365 --> 00:22:07,284
She likes money,
so use money to silence her...

270
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:08,785
so she doesn't complain later.

271
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,416
So-bong.

272
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,502
Thank you.

273
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,313
I'm at the gym, but you're not here.

274
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,023
I'm at the office.

275
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,193
Mr. Ji asked me to guard
the human Nam Shin.

276
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:45,197
That jerk needs to adjust quickly
for you to be free.

277
00:22:45,489 --> 00:22:48,367
I told Dad, so make yourself comfortable.

278
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:49,910
I'll be home soon.

279
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,299
You don't have...

280
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:07,177
your usual super luxurious look today.

281
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:11,223
I heard the real heir showed up.

282
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,851
Yes. I had nowhere else to go.

283
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:33,495
FUTURE STRATEGY OFFICE DIRECTOR
NAM SHIN

284
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,290
Shin.

285
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,513
What are you looking at? Get out.

286
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,851
I'll come when it's time for the meeting.

287
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,728
What are you doing?

288
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,982
The blinds are closed.
Are you looking for something?

289
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:47,277
I just wanted to be alone.

290
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,574
Here's the update on the M-Car.

291
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,367
Study it before the meeting.

292
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,661
Okay. You may go.

293
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,020
Where is it?

294
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,945
Did Mr. Kang's warm ups
look this luxurious?

295
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,489
Even if you wear something like this,

296
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,407
you totally look like...

297
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:36,201
a sportswear model.

298
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,078
That's because he isn't human.

299
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:39,704
-What?
-What?

300
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:41,873
I mean...

301
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,002
Gosh.

302
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,256
It's because he has long legs.
That's why.

303
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,882
I see.

304
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:55,971
Anyway, he isn't an heir
anymore as of today.

305
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,808
So you need to earn your keep.

306
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,269
What do you mean?
He isn't an heir anymore?

307
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,437
Were you pushed out by a brother?

308
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:07,941
That's bad. You're the highest
class person I know.

309
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,907
Start with this, okay?

310
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,243
Get that corner and that corner.

311
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,912
Clean up all the dust here...

312
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,999
and on the ceiling. Everything.

313
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,629
Darn it. You stupid...

314
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,507
Darn it.

315
00:26:37,554 --> 00:26:39,306
I was wrong about you.

316
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:41,641
-You were all about money.
-Right?

317
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,310
Now that he's no longer an heir,

318
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,978
-he's being mean to him.
-I know, right?

319
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:48,064
-Shut it.
-That's not right.

320
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:50,483
How could someone like him clean?

321
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:51,651
We may not complain,

322
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,779
but our backs hurt like crazy
after cleaning there.

323
00:26:57,115 --> 00:27:00,118
Go out later, and help him a little.

324
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,287
I'm done.

325
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,877
I'm done cleaning.

326
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,554
CHAMPION GYM

327
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,853
This is insane.

328
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:30,023
Did you call a cleaning crew
behind our backs?

329
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:34,235
-At least you won't starve.
-I don't need to eat.

330
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,904
I can do anything. Just say the word.

331
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,865
I can cook, do the dishes,
and even do laundry.

332
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:41,868
My gosh. Then our boss will get

333
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,828
arrested for
violating human rights laws.

334
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:46,164
For abuShing you like a slave.

335
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:48,124
Human rights?

336
00:27:48,416 --> 00:27:51,419
-What are you talking about?
-Human rights.

337
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:53,088
You're not treating him like a person...

338
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,256
just because he's no longer an heir.

339
00:27:57,801 --> 00:27:59,344
It's robot rights.

340
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:01,096
-Mr. Kang!
-Mr. Kang!

341
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:04,891
Gosh. Go pick up the pot.

342
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,770
Clean up in there, too!

343
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:14,275
-Hello?
-Hello, Mr. Nam. It's Dr. Lee.

344
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:18,780
I need to talk to you about the chairman.

345
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,035
Here.

346
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:28,081
Stop eating, will you?

347
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,041
Aren't we going to start?

348
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,879
I'm sorry. The Medical Car is going well.

349
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,048
The shareholders are favorable to it,

350
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,134
and the industry is
very interested as well.

351
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,845
Seeing how competitors are dying
to hurt it, it'll be a big hit.

352
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:45,932
Once we get confirmation that it's safe,

353
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,809
we'll get a temporary permit.

354
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,436
What about the hacking problem?

355
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,855
Won't it be rejected
if there's a security problem?

356
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,858
If the cyberattack
prevention protocol passes,

357
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:56,276
we shouldn't have any problems.

358
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,777
It was of huge help

359
00:28:57,861 --> 00:29:00,447
because you analyzed
the M-Car hacking situation.

360
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,951
-I did that?
-Yes.

361
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,954
You'll put the documents
together again, right?

362
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,248
With the abstracts
and translations again, too.

363
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:11,583
Thank you.

364
00:29:12,125 --> 00:29:13,585
Let's get lunch together.

365
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,545
A new restaurant opened downstairs.

366
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,672
Gosh, it's so fancy-looking.

367
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,842
We'll never get to try it
without his company card.

368
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:22,385
Are you here to play?

369
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,806
Put what together? Company card, what?

370
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,893
What do you take me for?

371
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,061
He switched characters again.

372
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:34,272
Mr. Nam.

373
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,525
-Do you have a split-personality?
-What?

374
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:44,699
Mr. Nam. Are you okay? 

375
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,867
Let go.

376
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,202
I don't need your help.

377
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,444
010-1172-0775

378
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:32,080
The number you have
dialed is not in service.

379
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,307
What's your problem?

380
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:53,852
Like it or not,

381
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,521
I'm your bodyguard right now.

382
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,152
Once you've calmed down,

383
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:04,904
I'll bring you to Dr. Oh's place.

384
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:07,574
Not there. I want to go home.

385
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,450
You can't go home like this.

386
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,869
You're my bodyguard.

387
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,495
You need to listen to your client.

388
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,289
I'll call Mr. Ji.

389
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:16,833
What are you doing?

390
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,835
You must be here for a reason.

391
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,296
You wouldn't be helping me for nothing.

392
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:24,299
If you want something, do your job.

393
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,926
Your job now is to put me back
in my place.

394
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,403
You're sweating.

395
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,865
You're the real Mr. Nam.

396
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:52,201
Welcome back to the company.

397
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,704
As expected,

398
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,247
there's no fooling you.

399
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:00,001
You aren't even well.
Why did you rush your return?

400
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,295
Is it...

401
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,048
because of what I said the other day?

402
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:08,718
Yes. I wanted to see
if that thing is better than I am.

403
00:32:09,677 --> 00:32:13,598
I had exaggerated on purpose
when I said that.

404
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:18,144
Please don't be upset.

405
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:21,230
I was a bit extreme as well,
so don't mind me.

406
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:23,900
I'll see you again.

407
00:32:56,808 --> 00:33:00,561
Do you think he'll really do
something to you?

408
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,815
I threw bait, so I knew he'd come to bite.

409
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:08,111
He's just as emotional as his dad.

410
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:10,154
He hasn't changed at all.

411
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,281
Did you predict all of this?

412
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:17,286
He'll continue to act as I predicted.

413
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,166
The chairman is waiting.

414
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,502
He called for me?

415
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:26,879
He said you knew everything.

416
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:31,300
We'll have to see
the blood test and MRI results,

417
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:33,344
but there's a high chance that
it's dementia.

418
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,097
He's very traumatized,

419
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,349
so he's resting.

420
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,124
It's nice because
you don't try to comfort me.

421
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:08,421
This is what I get for
messing with my life...

422
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,424
for all these years.

423
00:34:12,008 --> 00:34:13,634
I didn't tell anyone.

424
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:15,428
I know.

425
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,723
Because you keep your word.

426
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,684
How did you know
I knew you had dementia?

427
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,774
That hand.

428
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:32,862
-My hand?
-You can tell if someone is lying.

429
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,366
Do you...

430
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,536
know about me?

431
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:44,874
If you blink,

432
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,086
that means it's a lie.

433
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,013
Did Mom tell you?

434
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,557
Your mom doesn't know that I know.

435
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,143
Then it must've been David.

436
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,817
then you must also know that
he was in a coma.

437
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,569
then you must also know that
he was in a coma.

438
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,823
Then why didn't you go see him?

439
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,783
I'm more interested in you...

440
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,994
rather than humans.

441
00:35:23,454 --> 00:35:26,541
The human Nam Shin would be hurt
to hear that.

442
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,876
Talk about yourself, not Shin.

443
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:32,797
How was it being here?

444
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,050
Don't you want to remain here?

445
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,553
Why do you ask?

446
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:40,388
This is the human Nam Shin's place.

447
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,100
So-bong is here, and so is your mom.

448
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,977
If that is what you decide,
you can have

449
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,812
the company,
the car, the people,

450
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,108
and everything you want.

451
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,196
You know I'm a robot.

452
00:35:58,739 --> 00:36:00,283
Robots have no ambition.

453
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:03,161
Especially if it's taking from others.

454
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,554
What are you doing?

455
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,599
The blinds are closed.
Are you looking for something?

456
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,519
I just wanted to be alone.

457
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,081
DAEKUK LONG-TERM CARE HOSPITAL

458
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:51,083
A long-term care hospital?

459
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:05,264
It's huge.

460
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,726
Shin gave this to you?

461
00:37:09,435 --> 00:37:10,311
Yes.

462
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:15,066
Mommy, I think I understand
why adults say they die.

463
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:17,693
I think...

464
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,445
I'm so happy that I could die.

465
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,031
What?

466
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,411
What are you doing?

467
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:33,084
Shin! Thank you for the gift.

468
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,920
I love it so much!

469
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,762
-Hey.
-Shin.

470
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,972
What's wrong with you now?

471
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,433
You bought that for him,
but you're still unhappy?

472
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,521
I bought him that hideous thing?

473
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,734
I must've lost my mind for a moment.

474
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,070
If you like it, take it,
and get lost. I'm tired.

475
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,240
What? Get lost?

476
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:06,617
He isn't feeling well.

477
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:08,411
I think it would be best
if you go for now.

478
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,080
Fine.

479
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,002
People die if they change too drastically.

480
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:17,628
Let's go, Hee-dong.

481
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,053
I don't mean to get involved,

482
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,555
but must you go this far?

483
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,932
If you're too different...

484
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,684
You want me to act like that thing?

485
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,574
I'll go now.

486
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,535
The human Nam Shin can't see me here.

487
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,747
Don't ever tell anyone...

488
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,708
that I have dementia.

489
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,336
Can't I even tell the human Nam Shin?

490
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,463
Of course not.

491
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,591
I'll keep my promise...

492
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,676
since that's the rule.

493
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:07,636
This is why...

494
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:09,513
I like you.

495
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:15,186
You are close to the perfect human
that I've always imagined.

496
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,898
Don't deceive the human Nam Shin
for too long.

497
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,902
It's unfair for me to know if he doesn't.

498
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,543
Why are you here?

499
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:54,642
Don't you feel sorry towards Hee-dong?

500
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,602
Do I need to?

501
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,729
You freak.

502
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,816
-No.
-Move!

503
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,567
I'm going to see Dad.

504
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,154
You're always like that.

505
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,573
If anything doesn't go your way,
you cry to Grandfather.

506
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,786
I had forgotten...

507
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,288
what a jerk you were.

508
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,891
Come out after a few minutes.

509
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,150
I told you to stay somewhere else.

510
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,943
Why were you in that room?

511
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,737
I can't tell you. Sorry.

512
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,781
You're not doing this on purpose, are you?

513
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,450
Listen.

514
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,744
I detest this house,
but I hate seeing you here more.

515
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,539
I was your substitute,
but this was my home, too.

516
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:02,209
-What?
-And don't be mean to Hee-dong.

517
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:03,836
He's still a kid.

518
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,838
I don't care about this family.

519
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,507
So-bong, whom you cherish the most,
is by my side.

520
00:41:09,675 --> 00:41:12,136
She's here? So-bong is here?

521
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:15,055
That's right. Next to me. In my room.

522
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,933
People should be with people.
Don't you agree?

523
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:23,981
You can't say anything
at the mention of So-bong.

524
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,443
Should I pretend to be you
and mess with her?

525
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,819
Should I hold her hand and kiss her?

526
00:41:33,949 --> 00:41:35,284
When did you get back?

527
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,838
Give me a break.

528
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,595
Why did you come here?

529
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,056
I can't tell you. I promised Grandfather.

530
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,559
Okay. That's your charm.

531
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,561
I'll try to hold back
even if I want to know.

532
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,775
It's nice seeing you.
I didn't think I'd get to.

533
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,237
Go home first. I'll be right there.

534
00:42:11,862 --> 00:42:13,280
Can you go with me?

535
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:14,823
Let's go together now.

536
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,201
I'd like to as well,

537
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:19,286
but that jerk needs to adjust quickly
for your sake.

538
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,288
Don't worry.

539
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,874
I can handle anything
that jerk dishes out.

540
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,294
Do you want to go on a date tomorrow?

541
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,713
Like average people.

542
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,091
Sounds good. A date.

543
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,134
Like average people.

544
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:40,266
I checked, but nobody here uses
that number.

545
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:44,937
Then can I get the numbers
of your former employees?

546
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,689
The person in charge left for the day.

547
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:48,524
I understand.

548
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,152
If you find out, please give me a call.

549
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:53,737
PK again?

550
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,699
Someone from there came by before.

551
00:42:56,991 --> 00:42:57,866
Was it...

552
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,790
-this person?
-That's right.

553
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:08,168
That young punk was such a jerk.

554
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,320
You scared me!

555
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:40,826
You're telling the truth this time.

556
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:44,913
-What are you doing?
-Hold on.

557
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:50,836
Don't lose it again.

558
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,255
Your mom will be sad.

559
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:56,216
You're really the best slave ever.

560
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:58,218
You're the best master ever.

561
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:00,804
Thanks to you,
we got this far without getting caught.

562
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,770
Given that silly grin,
you must be thinking about him.

563
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,689
Why don't you get confused?

564
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,484
Everyone else gets confused, but not you.

565
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,153
You recognize him right away
even when we're together.

566
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:17,655
I can tell just by looking.

567
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:20,366
The power of love.

568
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:23,494
Do you like him that much?

569
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,788
Why do you hate him so much?

570
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,624
He doesn't hate you.

571
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:30,542
He acknowledges your existence...

572
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,294
and thinks of you before himself.

573
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,505
But you keep harassing him.

574
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,716
You even did that to his face.

575
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,010
Would you like it?

576
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,972
If something that looks exactly
like you showed up,

577
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:47,059
wore your clothes,
acted like you, and took your dad.

578
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:50,813
And people say she's better than you.

579
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,565
How would you feel?

580
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:19,508
I'm throwing out all the clothes
that he wore.

581
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,051
I'm childish, aren't I?

582
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,306
-What are you doing?
-I'll do it.

583
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,475
You should rest. I'll tell them...

584
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,644
to bring in new clothes
and watches tomorrow.

585
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,439
I suddenly feel like crud.

586
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:36,859
Why? Do you pity me?

587
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:47,453
I only thought about doing
the best I can for you.

588
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,456
I didn't have time to think...

589
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,833
about how you'd feel once you woke up.

590
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:58,213
Everything you're feeling
toward that robot...

591
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,424
is all because of me.

592
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,343
I'm sorry.

593
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,433
What's this? Why is this empty?

594
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,351
That's where the batteries were.

595
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:15,355
Doesn't he have a weakness?

596
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,984
What exactly is that manual mode?

597
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,444
How can I control him?

598
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:22,112
What's wrong with you?

599
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:23,530
Did something happen?

600
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:25,824
Just.

601
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:28,994
I'm just curious.

602
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:31,330
Shin.

603
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,334
People think you're thoughtless,

604
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,336
but I know.

605
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:40,172
You're not thoughtless.

606
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,174
You think way too much.

607
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:46,678
Please don't try to bear it all alone.

608
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:49,306
I know I'm lacking,
but you still have me.

609
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:53,936
You must be tired. Get some rest.

610
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,854
I'll tell them to take these away.

611
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:29,137
Yes, sir.

612
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:31,515
I'll tell Shin.

613
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:42,776
Apparently, Dr. Oh is very ill.

614
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:45,487
You should go to her after work.

615
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,828
Thank you again.

616
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,966
-You can wait outside.
-Pardon?

617
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,885
A mere bodyguard doesn't belong here.

618
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,428
Are you that clueless?

619
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:12,556
Yes, Mr. Nam.

620
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,392
I will wait outside.

621
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:29,323
What? Can't we work without So-bong?

622
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:31,491
No, sir.

623
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:34,870
What's with the safety test?

624
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:42,836
SAFETY TEST RESULTS

625
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,963
The self-driving aspect and...

626
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:48,467
the communication protection aspect
passed easily.

627
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:52,512
The core feature is automatically
switching...

628
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,723
to auto-drive when
the driver's health fails.

629
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:57,726
Luckily, those safety features
passed as well,

630
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:00,228
so we should get
an official test drive permit soon.

631
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,574
As expected,

632
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,369
you're the best, my son.

633
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:18,914
I told that punk to visit his sick mom,

634
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,248
but he didn't show up.

635
00:49:22,209 --> 00:49:23,210
Shin.

636
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,172
Wake up, Dr. Oh.

637
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:29,299
Which Shin are you asking for?

638
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:31,927
The Shin who cares for you is here.

639
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:36,598
Let's talk, David.

640
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,611
Don't make that face.

641
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:51,697
It's human beings' contemptible look.

642
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:53,365
Who told you that?

643
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:55,909
The chairman?

644
00:49:55,993 --> 00:49:57,119
Yes.

645
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,121
He said he has known that I was a robot.

646
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,876
-My son.
-What's your relationship with him?

647
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:06,628
Why did you deceive Mom?

648
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,634
We needed money to make you.

649
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:14,344
We couldn't give up.

650
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:17,723
You know scientists can't
continue without funding.

651
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,058
I'll explain everything to her later.

652
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:21,560
Please give me a chance.

653
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,437
I thought Mom would be okay without me...

654
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,272
because she had you.

655
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,816
But you lied to Mom and me for money.

656
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:33,947
Don't say you gave birth to me
with your heart anymore.

657
00:50:34,239 --> 00:50:36,533
I don't need a dad who lies to his family.

658
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:50,839
Grandfather...

659
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:18,658
Hey!

660
00:51:20,786 --> 00:51:22,871
Who are you? We've never met before.

661
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,291
Fine. Forget it.

662
00:51:26,374 --> 00:51:27,834
I'll go have fun by myself.

663
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,839
Just kidding. Let's go.

664
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,686
FORTUNE TELLER

665
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:51,191
You don't have a living person's fortune.

666
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,151
You're full of metallic energy.

667
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:54,820
Are you a hunk of metal?

668
00:51:57,322 --> 00:51:58,615
She's good.

669
00:52:00,826 --> 00:52:02,661
She's really good.

670
00:52:02,869 --> 00:52:04,996
How could she see that right away?

671
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:22,931
Can you play the piano?

672
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,391
No.

673
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,563
That's so cool.

674
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:45,495
VIDEO OF PIANIST

675
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,963
Protecting Kang So-bong...

676
00:53:37,505 --> 00:53:39,090
is top priority from now on.

677
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,245
My first friend, Kang So-bong.

678
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,121
Thanks for being my friend.

679
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,069
I want to watch a movie.

680
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,030
Okay.

681
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:52,622
Here's your popcorn.

682
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,332
Thank you.

683
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,716
Can you taste it?

684
00:55:10,056 --> 00:55:11,141
How does it taste?

685
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:12,309
Sweet?

686
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:14,894
Because you're with me?

687
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,062
What?

688
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,794
This is just an ad.

689
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:41,129
Why are you staring so hard?

690
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,090
It's my first time in a theater.

691
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:45,759
It's all so new to me.

692
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,347
This movie is supposed to be super sad.

693
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,769
It's starting.

694
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:42,107
It's because the movie is sad.

695
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:43,775
I know...

696
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,735
I don't need to hug you.

697
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,661
The tears are sparkling...

698
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:58,206
as they fall.

699
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,129
I'll get you some napkins.

700
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:15,932
Where are the napkins?

701
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:17,434
That way.

702
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,102
Thank you.

703
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,608
Thanks.

704
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:22,123
I heard.

705
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:31,883
I had so much to say.

706
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:33,885
But now that I see you,

707
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:36,804
I can't think of them.

708
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:53,988
It's so darn sad.

709
00:58:59,285 --> 00:59:00,411
You said...

710
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,122
you'd never confuse us.

711
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,539
M City.

712
00:59:44,622 --> 00:59:47,667
Only you can make my dream a reality.

713
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:49,502
I'll show Grandfather...

714
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:51,212
what's real and what's fake.

715
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,047
Don't hurt people. If you do,

716
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,257
I'm gone.

717
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:57,427
Imitate him all you want.
You can never be like him.

718
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:58,970
-How dare you...
-What are you doing?

719
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:00,763
Switch to manual mode.

720
01:00:03,224 --> 01:00:05,226
