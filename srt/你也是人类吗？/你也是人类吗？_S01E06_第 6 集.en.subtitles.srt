1
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,948
Do as I say.

2
00:00:32,699 --> 00:00:36,077
Shin. You just focus
on your wedding planning.

3
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:39,956
Marriage?

4
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,458
With this thing?

5
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,251
Marriage?

6
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:45,295
Me?

7
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:49,424
-Why are you here?
-Ms. Suh called Mr. Nam.

8
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:51,009
I'm sure it's about the wedding.

9
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,428
Let's go and refuse it.

10
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,555
We were supposed to refuse,

11
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:01,519
but the unexpected happened.

12
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:03,730
I'll accept all the terms you requested.

13
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,648
Shin and I...

14
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,442
will get married.

15
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,820
Shin. Marry Ye-na right away.

16
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,744
Shin, I'll be good. I promise.

17
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,173
A sign to refuse no matter what.

18
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,676
Search database on how to reject someone.

19
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:37,013
How about asking
a guy friend to act like...

20
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,723
-he is your boyfriend?
-I think...

21
00:01:38,807 --> 00:01:40,934
-you should refuse flat out.
-How frustrating.

22
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,353
Just bring someone else.

23
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,236
That woman.

24
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,156
The woman who knows my identity.

25
00:01:57,242 --> 00:02:00,995
-You'll go with me and help me?
-You helped me too.

26
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,789
I'm just repaying the debt.

27
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,958
A woman who knows
but is still willing to help me.

28
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,167
Kang So-bong.

29
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,577
I'm sure you all know what I mean.

30
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:04,934
Let go. Right now!

31
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,106
I won't apologize.

32
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,233
My online search told me
I shouldn't apologize

33
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,902
to a human woman after kissing her.

34
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,154
-What was that?
-But thank you.

35
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,198
I refused the marriage
thanks to your help.

36
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,824
Thanks to my help?

37
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,076
When did I say I'd help with my lips?

38
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,871
If you were human,
this would've been sexual assault!

39
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,540
There are times
it's a good thing I'm not human.

40
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:38,218
Your skin temperature went up two degrees.

41
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,762
Your skin pores increased in size,
sebum production increased.

42
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:43,598
The loss of collagen results
in drooping skin.

43
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,643
What are you talking about?

44
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,061
I don't understand.

45
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,104
Why did your skin temperature rise?

46
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,356
I have no feelings,

47
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,150
and you probably
had no feelings in that kiss.

48
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,112
-By any chance, are you excited?
-What? Excited?

49
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:01,032
The average Korean woman has
her first kiss at age 18.

50
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,992
It wasn't your first, was it?

51
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:09,666
First kiss?

52
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,793
What do you take me for?

53
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,712
Why do you care
about my kissing experience?

54
00:04:16,297 --> 00:04:17,382
Pervert.

55
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,645
You are so random. I told you to refuse
the marriage, not kiss someone.

56
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,480
I kissed her in order to refuse it.

57
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,399
Go after So-bong for now.

58
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,484
She must have been stunned,

59
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,278
so calm her down, and take her home.

60
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,889
I'm sorry. He already left.

61
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,725
He isn't being sincere.

62
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,643
He would never like a woman like her.

63
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,688
It's not that he likes her.
He just doesn't like you.

64
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,898
He put on an act.

65
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,026
It's not that serious.

66
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,779
It appeared to be
a clear expression of his opinion.

67
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:27,076
If that's how he feels,

68
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,912
we should shelf the wedding for a while.

69
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,834
I'll pretend this agreement
never happened either.

70
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,222
Ye-na, let's go.

71
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,819
That was an unexpected show.

72
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,237
Bye, Dad.

73
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,917
Where did the punk go?

74
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,712
Does he think he can just run off
after making such a mess?

75
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,506
I'm sorry, sir.

76
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,054
Let's eat.

77
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,390
I'm hungry.

78
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,061
I told you to eat.

79
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,523
-I'm sorry.
-It wasn't the first time...

80
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,483
he used a woman to rebel.

81
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:42,985
Lift your head up.

82
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:47,448
Young-hoon.

83
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,704
Yes, sir.

84
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,296
You've been hurt
by how I've treated you, right?

85
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,425
Shin was the one causing trouble,

86
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:09,011
but I always scolded
and hit you instead.

87
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,721
I'm fine.

88
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,433
I know you did it to make
Shin come to his senses.

89
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:15,643
You punk.

90
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,980
How is everything always fine with you?

91
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,402
Stop staring at an old man.

92
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:27,405
Go somewhere else,

93
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,033
and eat before you lose your appetite.

94
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:33,786
That's too much, sir.

95
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:36,581
Can't I give you this much?

96
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,500
Take it.
My arm's getting tired.

97
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,932
This is too much
for my university tuition.

98
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,352
You need to move out of the orphanage.

99
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,854
Take it.

100
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,232
No, sir.

101
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,110
If I accept this once,
I'll start depending on it.

102
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:07,653
You punk.

103
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,699
Then move out of there,
and move into my house.

104
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,413
Are you telling me
to move in and teach Shin?

105
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,707
No. I'm telling you...

106
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,586
to be Shin's shadow.

107
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,507
Everything you work on will become his.

108
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,259
Everything he does wrong
will be your fault.

109
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,388
I'm telling you to lead an unfair life,

110
00:08:35,932 --> 00:08:38,142
when you have
your whole life ahead of you.

111
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,812
In exchange,
you'll enjoy the same luxuries...

112
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:44,023
that Shin does.

113
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:47,276
I can promise that much.

114
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,242
Sorry, Young-hoon.

115
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:58,579
I'm negotiating with your life
with mere money.

116
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,420
I...

117
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,091
am more realistic than I seem.

118
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:14,011
The unfairness
that I'll experience as Shin's shadow...

119
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,099
will be nothing compared
to the unfairness...

120
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,934
I'll face for being an orphan.

121
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:24,272
Thank you. I'll make sure...

122
00:09:26,274 --> 00:09:27,608
you don't regret it.

123
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,318
No, sir.

124
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,905
Thank you for negotiating...

125
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:35,700
with my hopeless future.

126
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,879
1 MILLION WON

127
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,553
Hi, Hyun-joon.

128
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,347
I need to discuss
Mr. Nam's treatment with you.

129
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,099
Come to the hideout right now.

130
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,141
Stay right there.

131
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,400
You stupid robot!

132
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,276
Darn it! My lips!

133
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,290
Hi, Sweetie.

134
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,501
What's up?

135
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,253
Ms. Jo.

136
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,755
I received advanced
sexual harassment today.

137
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,923
"Advanced"?

138
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,843
All sexual harassment is primeval.

139
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:00,469
How could it be advanced?

140
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,516
Who was it? What jerk dared
touch my sweetie?

141
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,560
It wasn't a jerk,
but a hunk of metal...

142
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,605
Never mind.

143
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,191
He isn't human,
so I can't even report him.

144
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,777
-A hunk of metal?
-He isn't human?

145
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,363
Is this a joke or something?

146
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:21,115
Where are you?

147
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:24,201
I don't know.
I hopped on any random bus.

148
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,954
Bye. I'm getting off.

149
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,260
What are you doing here?

150
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,387
How did you...

151
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,599
Did you follow me?

152
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,058
GPS.

153
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:50,644
I said I could find you anywhere.

154
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:53,606
Who told you to follow me?
Who told you to track my location...

155
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,125
Hot spots in the area.
Pork trotters. Five minutes.

156
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,586
Second. Spaghetti pizza.
12 minutes.

157
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,421
Most popular among
female college students.

158
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,633
Third. Handmade burgers
with top quality beef. 25 minutes.

159
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,801
Fourth.

160
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,553
You have such odd abilities.

161
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,014
But sorry. It isn't food
that I need right now.

162
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:32,353
First tent bar, second tent bar,

163
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,230
third tent bar, and fourth tent bar.

164
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:37,483
I matched it to your budget and taste.

165
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,401
Number one is most recommended.

166
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,195
It got 4.3 stars.

167
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,197
"Their rolled omelet
with cheese is yummy."

168
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:47,618
Do you think I'll be tempted
with a rolled omelet?

169
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:03,384
It tastes good.

170
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,274
He's been watching you nonstop.

171
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,400
Do you know him?

172
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,401
Me?

173
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,113
Not at all.

174
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,842
Hello, Mr. Suh.

175
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,553
What's going on with you and Shin?

176
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,680
What was that earlier?

177
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:50,806
That's...

178
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,894
The thing is...

179
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,397
We're definitely not like that.

180
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,358
Mr. Nam totally used me.

181
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,818
Wait a second.

182
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:14,496
What is it? Have you no manners?
Don't you see I'm trying to sleep?

183
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,959
So-bong. I'm sorry,

184
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,836
but would you say that again?

185
00:15:21,378 --> 00:15:22,713
My daughter is listening,

186
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:25,299
so tell her exactly how Shin feels.

187
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,183
Mr. Nam totally used me.

188
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,232
I feel bad for saying this,

189
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,276
but I don't think
the wedding will happen.

190
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,862
It's because...

191
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,698
I don't think Mr. Nam wants it.

192
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,493
Thank you, So-bong,

193
00:15:53,035 --> 00:15:54,328
for telling me the truth.

194
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:59,792
If you're done, get out. I'm sleepy.

195
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:00,918
Ye-na,

196
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,130
I even got her number and called her.

197
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,966
How can you marry
someone who kisses anyone...

198
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,258
because he doesn't like you?

199
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,844
His lips will be mine anyway.
I don't mind lending them out briefly.

200
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,013
It's better to do it in my face

201
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,307
-than behind my back like other guys.
-Stop it!

202
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,810
Fine. I'll think it over again tomorrow.

203
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,396
I'm going to sleep,
so don't wake me up.

204
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,150
Fine.

205
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,152
Let's talk again tomorrow.

206
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,081
Mr. Suh, you're ridiculous.

207
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,500
Now, you make me lie to your daughter?

208
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,628
It's just nonstop drama.

209
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,671
Excuse me. Another bottle of soju, please.

210
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,797
Okay.

211
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:37,097
Miss.

212
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:39,224
Will you keep ignoring that young man?

213
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,268
He's been standing there for hours.

214
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,686
Don't you feel sorry for him?

215
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,190
I don't know what he did wrong,

216
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,567
but you shouldn't do that
to another human being.

217
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,277
What do you know?

218
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,488
He isn't a human being.

219
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,532
You're the one
who isn't a human being here.

220
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,870
Oh, my. It's pouring.

221
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,581
He left.

222
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,124
He left because it's raining.

223
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,626
Go home for good.

224
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,711
Go far away!

225
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,834
You thought I left, right?

226
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:49,962
Whatever.

227
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,217
I'm quite useful.

228
00:18:58,262 --> 00:18:59,555
Why are you doing this?

229
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,931
You're mad at me.

230
00:19:02,432 --> 00:19:04,643
Use me all you want until you feel better.

231
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,479
I'm strong, smart, and persistent.

232
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:08,689
Just say a word.

233
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:13,819
Since you helped me,
I'll help you too.

234
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,571
I don't need your help.

235
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:54,818
Hey, Tin Can.

236
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,572
I'll talk down to you from now on.
Hold the umbrella.

237
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,618
Cover yourself too!

238
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,370
People will think I'm a selfish witch.

239
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,541
Hey, you.

240
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,835
You're my robot slave from now on.

241
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,213
Robot slave?

242
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:15,881
You said I can use you.

243
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:17,132
You said you'd help me.

244
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,051
In front of others,
you're the chief director.

245
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,303
In front of me, you're my robot slave.

246
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,014
I'll make you run errands
and do all the housework.

247
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:27,142
-No?
-I'm fine with it.

248
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,895
I'm your robot slave from now on.

249
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:30,979
That's right.

250
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:33,732
This is a secret between
a human and a robot.

251
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,401
Don't you dare tell Mr. Ji.

252
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,196
Get a cab.

253
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:46,954
I called one already...

254
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,122
with this.

255
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,167
I guess you are useful.

256
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:55,754
-What are you waiting for? Let's go.
-Okay.

257
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,422
Then they must be together.

258
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,761
Yes. Thankfully,
we got past the situation.

259
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,305
He kissed a woman?

260
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,057
Is that even possible?

261
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,851
He probably concluded
it was the best option.

262
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:13,855
Good or bad, he's learning
how humans do things.

263
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,943
We didn't think of the marriage problem.

264
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,569
What do we do?

265
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,030
Mr. Suh is against it too anyway,

266
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,199
so we'll have to convince her.

267
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:27,995
Only Shin can persuade Ms. Suh.

268
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,789
My gosh. It's not like Shin
can wake up right now.

269
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,957
What do we do?

270
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,710
He can wake up.

271
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,591
There's a way to revive his consciousness.

272
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:50,142
It's a special ultrasound machine.

273
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:54,104
If we stimulate the brain
with ultrasound waves, he can wake up.

274
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,814
Has is been tested?

275
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:59,067
In 2016, a 25-year-old man woke up...

276
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,944
by using this machine in the U.S.

277
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:04,156
He was able to express
his feelings with motions.

278
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,241
There are even records
of him greeting people.

279
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,453
Is there proof
that it's from the ultrasound?

280
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:11,788
He may have woken up naturally.

281
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,498
Of course, that's a possibility.

282
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:16,001
The presenter was cautious as well.

283
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,128
We'll have to give it a shot.

284
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:20,380
Dr. Oh.

285
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,675
I'm his mom who left him behind...

286
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:27,054
while making excuses that I was afraid...

287
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,015
that his grandfather would harm him.

288
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,894
I made the other boy because I missed him.

289
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,856
While this boy endured
20 years without his mom,

290
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,984
I had that boy comforting me...

291
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,862
and forgot about this boy at times.

292
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,616
I feel ashamed and guilty.

293
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:50,786
I feel terrible.

294
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,042
You can get mad at Mom,

295
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,752
so wake up, Shin.

296
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,673
I'll live only for you...

297
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,218
and focus only on you.

298
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:09,554
Whatever the means may be,

299
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,182
whatever the likelihood
of success my be,

300
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,059
please, Shin.

301
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,160
Are you just getting home?

302
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:38,834
Why are you here?

303
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,463
I'm not here to see you.

304
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,341
I came to see her...

305
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:48,885
because I want to become close with her.

306
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,013
Shin, bring my luggage to the annex.

307
00:23:52,222 --> 00:23:54,099
I'll come over after seeing Grandpa.

308
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,394
So-bong, see you soon.

309
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:06,570
She's like solid steel.

310
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,156
Tin Can and Solid Steel.

311
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,783
What a perfect couple.

312
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,119
-I'm not made of tin, but CNT...
-Whatever.

313
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,579
CNT: CARBON NANO TUBE

314
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:18,206
She brought luggage.
This is not a good sign.

315
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:19,958
What if you get caught?

316
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:23,879
Bring it, Slave.

317
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:25,338
Yes, ma'am.

318
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:40,729
I signed the prenup and had it notarized.

319
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:44,024
I left behind the car, jewelry, clothes,

320
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,151
and everything that my dad bought me.

321
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:49,738
If my dad keeps opposing, I'll disown him.

322
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,740
This is insanity.

323
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,702
Dad. Aren't you so glad
she isn't your daughter?

324
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,371
Hey, you.

325
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:02,375
You've lost your marbles
because Shin kissed that girl.

326
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:06,796
Ye-na. Would you marry Shin...

327
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:09,633
even if I were a powerless
and sick old man?

328
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,260
It's not like I'm marrying you.

329
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:13,512
Oh, my gosh.

330
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:16,014
You are incorrigible.

331
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:23,438
I'll make that girl quit.

332
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,106
It's okay, Grandpa.

333
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,984
Once we're married,
I'll make her my bodyguard.

334
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,445
I just got chills.

335
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:34,449
Hey. All of this is useless.

336
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,701
You're exactly like your dad.

337
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,498
She did?

338
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,335
She brought her luggage
and went to see the chairman.

339
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:53,093
I'll come over, so make sure
nothing happens with Shin.

340
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:57,305
So-bong.

341
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,725
Thank you for calling.

342
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,732
He should take her home right now.

343
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,450
It's a bit cramped for two people.

344
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:18,702
Two?

345
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,329
You want to sleep here?

346
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,456
No? I'll go to Shin's room then.

347
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,499
No.

348
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,545
Here. Sleep here.

349
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,714
I'll sleep on the floor.

350
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,342
But don't unpack your luggage or anything.

351
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,012
Why should you suffer in this tiny room?

352
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,449
-You're back.
-You saw Ye-na, right?

353
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:01,369
She's staying in So-bong's room,
so be careful tonight.

354
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:04,039
I'll get rid of her somehow tomorrow.

355
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,608
A cool beer at the end of a tiring day.

356
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,402
I saw it in an ad.

357
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,491
Come... Come in.

358
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,288
So-bong isn't angry anymore.

359
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,999
That's good.

360
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,920
It's still difficult to understand
subtle emotions.

361
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,048
I'll do as you say from now on.

362
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,925
Please keep helping me.

363
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:01,012
There's a kill switch.

364
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,264
He doesn't know it yet.

365
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:05,684
Because if the real Shin wakes up,

366
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,270
the fake Shin needs to disappear.

367
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,275
I'm sorry.

368
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,027
For what?

369
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,321
For making you come here,

370
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:21,074
making you pretend to be Shin,

371
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,159
getting angry sometimes and everything.

372
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,661
It's okay.

373
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:27,455
It's because you care
about the human Nam Shin.

374
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,334
I care about him?

375
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,296
That may not be all.

376
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,099
I get confused sometimes, myself.

377
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,977
Do I like Shin,

378
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:51,896
or do I like what he has?

379
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,442
I wonder if I'm upset
because of the things...

380
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,903
I can enjoy when I'm with Shin.

381
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:06,828
Do you want to take my hand?

382
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:10,790
I want to check how I truly feel.

383
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,210
It's useless.

384
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,839
Conflict and strife cannot be
judged by a lie detector.

385
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,800
Conflict and strife.

386
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,179
So that's how I feel.

387
00:29:25,555 --> 00:29:27,766
I recognize the emotions on your face
right now.

388
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,560
Sadness...

389
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,687
and misery.

390
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,276
Don't trust humans too much.

391
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:43,156
Even you?

392
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:46,910
Even Mom and David?

393
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:18,608
RELOAD

394
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:20,693
Don't trust humans too much.

395
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:25,532
If I don't trust humans,

396
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,952
what must I trust?

397
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,131
Mama!

398
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,426
I thought you had no mom.

399
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,136
You startled me.

400
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:31,598
Hey. Why are you sitting there?

401
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,225
I was watching the night sky,
and the sun rose.

402
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,730
That's the leg with the steel rod.

403
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:40,440
You should stop running.

404
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,359
Hey. I run faster and longer...

405
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,069
than most guys, okay?

406
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,540
Don't annoy me, and go.

407
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,042
I'm going to run too.

408
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,619
Just go ahead of me!

409
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:36,496
Go away!

410
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,623
Give up if you're tired.

411
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,832
I don't get tired.

412
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:06,192
Blood pressure, 139 over 96. Pulse, 136.

413
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,069
Slowly take deep breaths.

414
00:33:09,946 --> 00:33:11,447
I'm fine.

415
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:17,829
Get on my back.

416
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,748
I never asked you to carry me.
Move.

417
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,917
-Get on.
-Forget it!

418
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,670
It's okay since I'm your slave.

419
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,689
Just do what I tell you.

420
00:33:44,772 --> 00:33:45,857
Don't get smart with me.

421
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,621
I didn't see either of you,

422
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:02,582
but you were together again.

423
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,459
Mr. Nam has grown weak,

424
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:06,627
so I took him out for a run.

425
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:07,920
A run?

426
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:10,548
But he isn't sweating.

427
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:12,925
You're still here?

428
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,886
Should I kiss her again?

429
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,389
-Shin.
-How dare you?

430
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,642
If you don't listen to me,
I'll fire her right away!

431
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:48,461
Ye-na agreed to all of my terms.

432
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,256
Let's have a small wedding
with family members only.

433
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,758
Grandpa.

434
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,927
Ye-na, call your mom in Boston,

435
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,386
and tell her to come.

436
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:01,224
Even if you weren't close,
she should still see you get married.

437
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:02,475
Okay, I will.

438
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,518
I'm leaving.

439
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:07,563
Won't you care if she gets hurt?

440
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:11,400
Your bodyguard,
whose name I don't even want to say.

441
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:12,860
Why?

442
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:15,947
Do you think I'll get married
if you fire her?

443
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,658
Just firing her won't be enough.

444
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:21,786
How far should I go?

445
00:35:22,703 --> 00:35:23,788
Her family.

446
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,457
Her future. Her life.

447
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:31,337
What must I mess with...
for you to listen to me?

448
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:34,048
What of yours must
I mess up for you to listen?

449
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:36,008
What was that?

450
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,762
Why you little...

451
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,308
-How dare you...
-Must not harm humans.

452
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,318
Let's go, Mr. Nam.

453
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:56,904
I'm sorry, sir.

454
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,950
Tin Can. Let's go.

455
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,539
Jung-woo!

456
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,921
Jung-woo.

457
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:17,383
Listen to Dad. You're all that I have.

458
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,260
If you leave,

459
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,847
I won't have anyone, son!

460
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,057
Jung-woo.

461
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,311
Not this woman!

462
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,981
Laura Oh! Not this woman! Never!

463
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:33,149
No!

464
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,067
Laura Oh is my mom.

465
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,195
What's wrong Grandpa?

466
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,198
Why are you saying she's Shin's mom?

467
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:43,993
Laura! Not her! Never!

468
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,286
-Dad!
-No!

469
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,787
What did you do?

470
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,081
What did you do to Dad?

471
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:07,850
Hi.

472
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,435
What brings you...

473
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,146
Did you come to get Ms. Suh?

474
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,231
Yes.

475
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,485
The worker here told me
that Ye-na is in the chairman's room.

476
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,528
I can't drag her out in front of him.

477
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,822
I'll come back another time.

478
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,417
Mr. Suh...

479
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,461
probably heard everything.

480
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:38,965
I'm sure he did.

481
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:42,176
Even the workers can't come near here.

482
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,886
If he rushed out of here...

483
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,763
by using the workers as an excuse...

484
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:51,394
His guard saw too. What about her?

485
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,813
I can make sure she doesn't talk.

486
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:55,940
But...

487
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,026
Don't look at me like that.

488
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,445
I don't like being treated like a spy.

489
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:02,989
You are a spy.

490
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:05,491
You're still his child.
I'm sure you'll tell him.

491
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,118
I will not.

492
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,828
If your dad finds out,

493
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,746
this marriage is never happening.

494
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:13,749
I'll look into it...

495
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:15,835
and see if my dad really heard.

496
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,296
If you do,

497
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,256
that would help a lot.

498
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,508
A child will spy on her own dad?

499
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,094
I don't believe it.

500
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,431
The moment she walks out of here,
 it's game over.

501
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,308
You said I'm like my dad, right?

502
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,310
You're right.

503
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,271
I must have what I want...

504
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,647
just like my dad.

505
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,526
I'll fight anyone who gets in my way
even if it's my dad.

506
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:44,447
You trust me, right?

507
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,377
I need to check something.

508
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,338
Call me when you get the chance.

509
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,299
Is it about his dementia?

510
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:12,391
Leave my luggage.

511
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:13,768
I'll be back soon.

512
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,688
I'll go home from the office.

513
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:18,898
Trust me, and wait.

514
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,297
He has never done that before.

515
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,634
Get on my back.

516
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,719
Tin Can. Let's go.

517
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,181
No way.

518
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,142
Sir, please hurry.

519
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,480
The chairman has dementia, doesn't he?

520
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,233
What should I say if Mr. Suh asks...

521
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:03,901
if I saw it?

522
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,362
We need to find out
how much he knows first.

523
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,073
Don't take his calls...

524
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,658
until Ms. Suh contacts us.

525
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:12,159
Ms. Suh?

526
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,746
She's going to test her own dad?

527
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,873
What a messed up family.

528
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,792
I'll be in the chairman's room.

529
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,711
If Shin's condition
gets out now, we're dead.

530
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,214
Stick together, and make sure
he doesn't get caught.

531
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:27,383
We will.

532
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:35,808
What are you doing?

533
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,561
He told us to stick together.

534
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,647
-Hey. Get off.
-Yes, ma'am.

535
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,777
You knew about the dementia, didn't you?

536
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,613
-Yes.
-How could you not tell me?

537
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:54,326
But your grandpa being sick is one thing.

538
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,703
Why is he so mean to me?

539
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:58,122
"My family, my future, my life."

540
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,207
"Which must I mess
with for you to listen?"

541
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,001
I felt my heart stop when I heard that.

542
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,464
But you looked like a real manly man.

543
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,633
"What of yours must
I mess up for you to listen?"

544
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:11,802
And when you stopped him like this,

545
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,388
you seemed really manly.

546
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,974
That would make most girls swoon.

547
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:19,518
Really?

548
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,022
-That wasn't an invitation.
-Okay.

549
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:46,712
He definitely has dementia.

550
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,006
What did Dr. Lee say?

551
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:52,635
I asked in passing
about the chairman's health,

552
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,844
and he didn't even respond.

553
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:58,599
I knew him for 20 years,
but he's very strict.

554
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:03,062
We'll have to find another route.

555
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,856
We must be cautious.

556
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,235
Without concrete evidence,
we'll just hurt ourselves.

557
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:14,073
All we need is a person
to get us the evidence.

558
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:25,584
Mr. Nam was in charge of the test drive.

559
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,253
Why are you leaving?

560
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:31,924
This team wasn't dissolved thanks to him.

561
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,301
He stopped the bigger disaster.

562
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:37,137
But he's up for reassignment now.

563
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,932
It's his company,
so he'll make a comeback soon.

564
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,601
Stop talking about stupid things.

565
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,646
I wanted to take a break anyway.

566
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,400
I'll drop off my things.
Let's go eat together.

567
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,113
I wonder
who the new senior manager will be.

568
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,615
What? What's this?

569
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,285
Someone updated the kill switch.

570
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,494
What?

571
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,290
You're right.

572
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,084
Did you do this?

573
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,670
No. Who could it have been?

574
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:11,755
No one is better than I am.

575
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,882
Did someone hack in again?

576
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:16,176
What's our security team's number?

577
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,683
Hey.

578
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,436
Let's say I did this.

579
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,731
It's best if one of us
becomes the new senior manager.

580
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,150
Do as you please.

581
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:34,486
I'll find out who did it.
It's annoying me.

582
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:41,994
Hello, everyone.

583
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,464
Mr. Suh.

584
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,013
Don't be nervous.

585
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,183
I wanted to know
how the self-driving car team was doing.

586
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:09,063
It's a shame about Ms. Yeo.

587
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:10,648
Yes.

588
00:44:11,565 --> 00:44:14,693
The people left behind have to work hard.

589
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:18,614
In order to prevent similar
problems in the future,

590
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:21,492
I've upgraded the kill switch.

591
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,205
You did it yourself?

592
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:29,625
That's incredible.

593
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:35,255
We'll upgrade
the hacking prevention system...

594
00:44:35,381 --> 00:44:37,508
that you mentioned on top of that.

595
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:41,970
Dad?

596
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,228
Dad.

597
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,984
Ms. Suh.

598
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,154
Mr. Suh left for an appointment.

599
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,281
-Would you like some tea?
-No, thanks.

600
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,325
-I'll come back another time.
-Okay.

601
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,470
What medicine is this?

602
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:24,972
Is someone sick?

603
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,766
Dad.

604
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,812
He knows for sure.

605
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,483
The chairman called you
"Jung-woo" earlier, right?

606
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:38,902
Who is that?

607
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,701
Nam Jung-woo.
Chairman Nam's only son.

608
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,579
The human Nam Shin's father
and Mom's husband.

609
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,289
He passed away in 1997.

610
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,253
He mistook his grandson for his dead son?

611
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,009
Even families like this
have their sad stories.

612
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,475
Hi, In-tae.

613
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:12,811
What?
Why would my dad come here?

614
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,315
You said you'd come, but you didn't.

615
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:18,942
He says he needs to check
if you're really there.

616
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,695
You know his temper.

617
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,323
I'll go right now, so hold on to him.

618
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,878
What? Scram.

619
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:38,796
It's my car.

620
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,422
Cheapskate.

621
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:44,218
I'll drive since we must stick together.

622
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,563
You stopped again?
Just cross on yellow!

623
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:59,650
It's the rule to stop at a yellow line.

624
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,569
You and your rules. I have rules too.

625
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:05,113
If you don't listen,
I'll sell you for scraps.

626
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,533
Should I sell your arm first? Or your leg?

627
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,118
Junkyards don't buy or sell CNT.

628
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:12,955
Let's go.

629
00:47:18,627 --> 00:47:21,129
Sweetie! Did you get
home safely last night?

630
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,674
I couldn't sleep
because I wanted to know...

631
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,801
what an advanced sexual harassment is.

632
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:29,346
What did you mean by "a hunk of metal"?

633
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,098
I'm not made of metal, CNT...

634
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:33,183
I'm on my way, so bye!

635
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:38,730
Don't cut into my conversation.
Cut into the lane.

636
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,024
It's the rule not to cut in.

637
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,319
Please!

638
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,821
CHAMPION GYM

639
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,990
Please, sir! Seriously.

640
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:50,200
Let go.

641
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:52,536
I'll just see if she's there.

642
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:56,331
-Let go.
-She'll be here soon. Come help me.

643
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,251
I don't get involved
in other people's family matters.

644
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,838
-I'm cool like that.
-Let go already!

645
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:08,093
Hey, hey! So-bong. So-bong!

646
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:17,311
Where's Dad?

647
00:48:18,103 --> 00:48:19,563
Right there.

648
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:26,278
You two switched roles.

649
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,113
Isn't he your boss?

650
00:48:30,365 --> 00:48:32,576
Thank you, Mr. Nam.

651
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,788
Isn't my boss such a gentleman?

652
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:40,292
Let's go in, Dad.

653
00:48:42,044 --> 00:48:43,837
You should stay out here.

654
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,389
What's going on? Is it true?

655
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:58,226
I'm really working there.

656
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,438
Stop doubting me for no reason and relax.

657
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,191
Why is your boss driving you

658
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,194
and opening doors for you?

659
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,864
I don't have anything on him.
It's my skills.

660
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,867
They want me desperately now.

661
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,912
Believe what you see.
This is how awesome...

662
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:19,414
your daughter is.

663
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,166
You never made me trust you before.

664
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,168
You always lied. How can I trust you?

665
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,253
Hey, hey! What's wrong with you?

666
00:49:25,545 --> 00:49:27,381
Hey! Why you...

667
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,633
Hey, hey, hey! What's wrong with you?

668
00:49:30,133 --> 00:49:31,510
He'll get hurt.

669
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:35,222
Look how fair-skinned he is.

670
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,850
I bet you never even arm wrestled.

671
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,770
But this punk said he kissed So-bong.

672
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:44,773
Without her consent!
He kissed her on his own!

673
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,274
What? He kissed her?

674
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,860
-No, no.
-What's going on? Is that true?

675
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,320
No, no. That's not it.

676
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,322
It is true that I kissed you.

677
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:57,744
Why you little...

678
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,080
No, Dad! Don't!

679
00:50:06,378 --> 00:50:07,421
-Mr. Kang!
-Mr. Kang!

680
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:10,007
Let go. Let go!

681
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:14,970
Why, you!

682
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,564
Do you want to die? Is that it?

683
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,283
-Mr. Kang!
-Mr. Kang!

684
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,378
I must not harm humans.

685
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,723
Let's not do this.

686
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:00,849
It isn't me.

687
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,768
My instincts kicked in.

688
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:05,395
What's going on here?

689
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,484
Dad. I'm leaving.

690
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:30,712
Hey, Tin Can. Why did you
tell them about the kiss?

691
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,005
They asked, so I answered.

692
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:37,177
Spike in blood pressure and pulse.

693
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:40,013
You're excited again.
What's the reason this time?

694
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:44,309
Don't hold my hand
whenever you want and so carelessly!

695
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:45,393
It isn't...

696
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,105
because of me, is it?

697
00:51:48,188 --> 00:51:50,065
Because my lips feel just like a human's?

698
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,358
Who says it does?

699
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:54,152
Talk about the kiss one more time and...

700
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:57,447
When humans are intimate there's
an increase in endorphins and dopamine.

701
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:59,699
This results in increased
interest in the other person.

702
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:02,202
Are you more interested in me now?

703
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:04,162
Do you like me now?

704
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:32,899
Get it now?

705
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,693
I have no feelings for you.

706
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:36,820
You're all metal and plastic.

707
00:52:36,903 --> 00:52:38,864
You're just an object in my eyes.

708
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:42,367
Don't act like a person
in front of me again.

709
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:44,452
Get the car.

710
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:46,830
Yes, ma'am.

711
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:55,547
What did I just do?

712
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,136
I must've gone mad.

713
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,147
Jong-gil found out about the dementia?

714
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:16,193
Yes. It isn't certain, but it's possible.

715
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:20,739
Suh Jong-gil found out
about the chairman's dementia.

716
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,325
If he finds out about this too, then--

717
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:24,826
That will not happen.

718
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,037
He couldn't even imagine it.

719
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:32,292
Dr. Oh. I didn't want to worry you,

720
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:34,502
but on the day of Shin's accident,

721
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,880
a man with a gun was following him.

722
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,342
That mysterious man showed up
at the lab later,

723
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:42,010
so we came back to Korea.

724
00:53:42,761 --> 00:53:44,429
It may not be safe here either.

725
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:47,807
What if Mr. Suh sent that man?
What does that mean?

726
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,476
Please...

727
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:53,980
I hope the ultrasound
device wakes Shin up.

728
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,295
Why aren't you answering your phone?

729
00:54:17,379 --> 00:54:19,756
Where are you?
Mr. Suh is looking for you.

730
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:21,925
Why can't I reach you?

731
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:23,718
Call me when you get this.

732
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,769
What of yours must
I mess up for you to listen?

733
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:34,396
Why you little...

734
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:41,152
I never knew he had it in him.

735
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:44,948
Dad?

736
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:52,205
Hee--dong is here.

737
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:55,667
He said he had to see his sick grandpa.

738
00:54:56,209 --> 00:54:58,086
Go ahead. Say hi.

739
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,464
Hello.

740
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:04,342
Grandpa.

741
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,345
Why did you bring him here
so late at night?

742
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:09,764
Send him back to his dad.

743
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,267
Is Shin your only blood?

744
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:14,853
Hee-dong is your grandson too.

745
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:16,438
I got it, so stop.

746
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:18,940
I'm tired.

747
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:35,874
Look at Mommy.

748
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:40,420
Why are you so afraid of him?

749
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,132
What did I say?

750
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:47,761
Don't tell Grandpa that I'm sick.

751
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:50,555
That's right.

752
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:55,685
Grandpa really hates weak people,

753
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:58,063
so don't tell him about your heart.

754
00:55:58,480 --> 00:55:59,564
Okay, son?

755
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:12,160
Hee-dong.

756
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,454
Let's go out.

757
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,369
So you're Hee-dong.

758
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:57,372
Hello.

759
00:56:57,455 --> 00:56:58,456
Hi.

760
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,209
Why did you want to see me?

761
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,711
What could we possibly have to discuss?

762
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,969
About this child's future.

763
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,352
So-bong.

764
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:03,563
I'm sorry about this afternoon.

765
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,900
I shouldn't have threatened your life.

766
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:09,486
I was out of line.

767
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:12,739
It's because I'm old and sick,

768
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,116
so please understand.

769
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:16,868
It's okay.

770
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:18,203
Please...

771
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,705
continue to look out for my boy, Shin.

772
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:26,085
If I end up not being able
to recognize you,

773
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,255
sit me down here.

774
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:33,384
I watched you grow from right here,

775
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,471
so I'm sure...

776
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,848
I'll recognize you once in a while.

777
00:58:45,647 --> 00:58:48,233
He isn't sick.

778
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,277
I don't know what you heard,

779
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:53,571
but you're mistaken.

780
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:55,823
When Ye-na was that age,
she looked like...

781
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:59,494
she'd eat all the ice cream in the world.

782
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:01,496
How shameless.

783
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:04,415
-Hee-dong, let's go.
-If Shin replaces the chairman,

784
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:08,419
it's bad for us both, isn't it?

785
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:10,838
That man...

786
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:15,343
wouldn't even look at a sick child.

787
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:19,389
Are you threatening me right now?

788
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:21,933
The mom must choose the right path...

789
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,561
for the sick child to live a long life.

790
00:59:26,521 --> 00:59:29,440
Air conditioning and ice cream.

791
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:31,568
Gosh.

792
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:34,779
Hee-dong. You must be cold.

793
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,783
What are you doing to him?

794
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:39,993
Hee-dong.

795
00:59:40,368 --> 00:59:43,121
Ask your mom to make a wise decision.

796
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,375
I'm not a very patient man.

797
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,002
Mommy.

798
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,595
Yes, my dad has dementia.

799
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,266
Happy now?

800
01:00:12,358 --> 01:00:13,818
How did...

801
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,488
this grandpa...

802
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:22,493
How did I...

803
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:30,168
I have dementia, Shin.

804
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,721
You don't have dementia, Grandpa.

805
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:19,967
-What are you doing?
-What is this?

806
01:01:21,469 --> 01:01:22,637
Hey!

807
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,555
Write up a diagnosis for my dad.

808
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:27,016
What are you talking about?

809
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,394
The doctor says he has dementia.

810
01:01:29,477 --> 01:01:30,853
Mr. Suh.

811
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:32,397
It's not people that are scary,

812
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,649
but it's what people do that's scary.

813
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:36,818
You can relax since I'm here.

814
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,071
What? Where's your watch?
The battery's low.

815
01:01:40,613 --> 01:01:43,074
If she finds out I'm not really Nam Shin,

816
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:44,492
she'll throw a fit, won't she?

817
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:47,870
