1
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,704
Don't look at me like that, Jung-woo.

2
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:44,502
What are you doing?

3
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:52,802
Look how much your son has grown.

4
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,434
Let go! Let go of me!

5
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,565
Jong-gil. You can't do this to me!

6
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,150
You need to stop.

7
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,278
It's hard being between you
and the chairman.

8
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,530
Let's talk. Just the two of us.

9
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,960
My wife should be here with my son...

10
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,587
to give a lecture.

11
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,631
I'll leave the country...

12
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:32,342
with them after the lecture.
So please, let me out.

13
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,178
So why did you do something so stupid?

14
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,389
An heir who's a whistleblower?
The world will laugh.

15
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,267
Give me those documents on Mr. Kim.

16
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,685
Mr. Kim...

17
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,813
It was Father's doing, right?

18
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,942
Did you kill him?
Because Father told you to?

19
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,568
I told you, it wasn't me!

20
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:55,573
I didn't know he'd go that far.

21
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:57,534
Still,

22
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,037
you're his son.
You need to look the other way!

23
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,414
As his son, I can't do that!

24
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,042
Is Mr. Kim more important
than the chairman?

25
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,086
Don't you care what happens
to the company?

26
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,380
I don't need a company that kills people.

27
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:12,924
Or a person who kills people.

28
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:18,680
A person who has a lot
really is different.

29
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,307
You can throw things away
without thinking.

30
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,520
I worked my ass off
as your friend and assistant.

31
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,398
You can always come back to your position,

32
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,817
but if I lose mine, I'll die!

33
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,862
Please, Jung-woo.

34
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,614
Give me the documents on Mr. Kim!

35
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,493
I'm sorry, Jong-gil.

36
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,780
Jung-woo.

37
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:00,990
Jung-woo!

38
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:07,580
Jung-woo.

39
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:14,545
Hello? What is your emergency?

40
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,546
Why...

41
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,881
How may I help you?

42
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,424
did I get that thought?

43
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,550
Hello?

44
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:22,553
Hello? How may I help you?

45
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:24,347
Hello?

46
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,140
Hello?

47
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:37,735
Once. I should look
the other way just once.

48
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,487
What do you think you're doing?

49
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:25,158
It won't end with just me
getting arrested!

50
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,120
I know...

51
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,457
why you locked up your healthy son...

52
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,335
and how you got rid of Mr. Kim.

53
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,587
I know everything.

54
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:45,386
You and I did all that for PK.

55
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,097
Jung-woo can't come back to life,

56
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:50,475
but you must protect PK.

57
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:06,824
Bury everything...

58
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:10,912
and say it was suicide.

59
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,376
Yes, sir.

60
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,507
CHAIRMAN NAM GUN-HO

61
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,218
If you look the other way just once,

62
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,470
that seat is mine.

63
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:29,972
-Let go! Shin!
-Mom!

64
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,099
-Mom!
-Let go!

65
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,351
Shin! No!

66
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,228
Shin! Let go.

67
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:37,438
If I become
a scumbag just one more time...

68
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,154
If I become heartless
just one more time...

69
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,369
Just one more time.
That's all it'll take.

70
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:53,454
This is a recording...

71
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,665
of the chairman
and Jung-woo's conversation...

72
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:56,833
at the nursing home.

73
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:58,793
Why are you giving this to me?

74
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:02,964
I am afraid that you'll end up
like Jung-woo.

75
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,049
The moment he determines...

76
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,135
that the robot is more
beneficial to the company,

77
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,470
the chairman will get rid of you...

78
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,931
without a moment's hesitation.

79
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:13,766
Just like he did with Jung-woo.

80
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,991
So this is what she meant
by Shin controlling him.

81
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:32,326
I'm almost there.

82
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:38,458
This is what I've wanted.

83
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,343
ACCESS DENIED

84
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,989
I'm sorry...

85
00:08:11,949 --> 00:08:13,409
for finally hugging you now.

86
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,748
I thought something
really happened to you.

87
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,045
I was so scared that
you wouldn't come back.

88
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,090
You were terrible.

89
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:30,718
You were really terrible.

90
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,445
Mr. Chairman.

91
00:08:55,826 --> 00:08:57,119
What happened?

92
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:01,082
I'm sorry.
Grandfather was shocked because of me.

93
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,584
It wasn't you.
It was because of that jerk.

94
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:07,255
That jerk pretty much
choked his own grandfather.

95
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,423
Shin did this?

96
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,935
Grandfather has dementia.

97
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:22,853
For real.

98
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,233
Someone may come, so leave.

99
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:29,860
Let's go.

100
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,411
Mr. Chairman.

101
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,163
Mr. Chairman, please get up.

102
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,549
What's wrong with me?

103
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,761
-Why am I...
-Let's go down.

104
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,982
He really has dementia?

105
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:13,404
You're too cruel.

106
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,842
SUH JONG-GIL

107
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:40,348
Where are you? You should hide.

108
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:44,268
I've prepared a quiet place.
You should accept my help.

109
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,824
I'm fine, so don't worry.

110
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:03,204
Let me make this clear.
This wasn't your fault.

111
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,582
A bad human used you to do a bad thing.

112
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,209
It wasn't your fault.

113
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,086
Still, you got hurt.

114
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,671
I'm fine.

115
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:13,964
You came back.

116
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,885
You came back
because you're not evil like that jerk.

117
00:11:18,469 --> 00:11:21,472
You protect people and hug them
when they cry.

118
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:25,643
You even overrode
the manual mode to stop hurting me.

119
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,897
Do you realize how grateful
and proud I am of you?

120
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,526
-Let's go to a doctor.
-No.

121
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:35,945
Let's go to my place.

122
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:38,197
I want to go home with you.

123
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,533
Let's go.

124
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,501
You need to eat, sir.

125
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,045
That's much better than an IV.

126
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,214
Stop this, Dad.

127
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,801
You need to eat to get better.

128
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,013
Please stop. It'll be harder for him.

129
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,143
I need to talk with Young-hoon.

130
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,104
Give us some privacy.

131
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,994
Where's Shin?

132
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,621
We're searching hotels
and everywhere we can.

133
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,208
Since he tried to kill me,

134
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,588
he won't be able to show his face.

135
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,590
I know you can't forgive him,

136
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,552
but I'll bring him and
make him beg for forgiveness.

137
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,138
Young-hoon.

138
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,516
Do you still think...

139
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,896
Shin is capable of handling my position?

140
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,694
I'm tired.

141
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,113
You may go.

142
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,407
Don't you think...

143
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,162
it was you who made him like that?

144
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:24,929
The person you have reached...

145
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,184
The person you have reached...

146
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:32,186
Why are you searching
so desperately for him?

147
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:34,647
Dad told us not to tell
Shin that he has dementia.

148
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:39,610
Did that punk get in trouble
and hide again?

149
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,628
Are you awake, sir?

150
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,841
Why so early in the morning?

151
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,386
Are you bragging that this is your place?

152
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:07,805
Not at all.

153
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,809
Please come out.
There's someone you must see.

154
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,153
Dr. Lee needs to tell you something.

155
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,788
Why are you here?

156
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:36,208
The chairman is mentally very tired.

157
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,544
So?

158
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,715
Dementia requires emotional stability.

159
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,259
Please go, and be of strength to him.

160
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,303
Dementia?

161
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,013
Seeing how he asked for you

162
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,389
right after being diagnosed,

163
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:54,351
he must trust you a great deal.

164
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,439
He doesn't say it,
but I'm sure he's waiting for you.

165
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,150
He asked for me first?

166
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,277
-Mr. Nam.
-Dr. Lee.

167
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,904
You should go.

168
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,489
He's just upset.

169
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,075
He'll go see the chairman soon.

170
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,756
I thought you should know
what was going on.

171
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,509
I wonder why the chairman...

172
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,888
asked for that robot instead of you...

173
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:32,765
as soon as he was diagnosed with dementia.

174
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:37,102
Especially, given that
he knows it's a robot.

175
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,437
Don't pretend to care.

176
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,067
Are you antagonizing me
since Grandfather didn't die?

177
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,027
I can see right through you.

178
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,946
I know what you want to use me for.

179
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:51,909
You can get angry later.
You should visit him first.

180
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,872
He'll announce his successor
before he gets worse.

181
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:00,918
You can't let it be the robot.

182
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,672
Call me if you need my help.

183
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,549
Please let me make up for being unable...

184
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,594
to save Jung-woo through you.

185
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,656
2 MISSED CALLS
YOUNG-HOON

186
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,244
NEW VOICEMAIL

187
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,578
CONNECTING

188
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,165
Where are you?

189
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,709
Call me before I find you.

190
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,711
If I find you, you'll regret it.

191
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,422
Shin.

192
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,132
It's Mom.

193
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,895
I had no choice but to come.

194
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,857
He almost killed
someone against the rules.

195
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,692
Your son is too cruel.

196
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:09,111
But he came back in the end.

197
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,156
That's right.
He made more progress.

198
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,575
He successfully hacked into himself...

199
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,077
and vitalized the parts
that aren't controlled...

200
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,829
to stop the orders.

201
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,914
He pulled it off after just a few tries.

202
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:22,499
He is incredible indeed.

203
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,502
Did you come to tell me that?

204
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:31,759
Dr. Oh. Let's go back.

205
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:34,470
Let's go back with him
and live as we used to.

206
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,805
Your son doesn't want you.

207
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,432
Don't try to confuse me.

208
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,434
And don't come here again.

209
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,395
Are you really not worried...

210
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:45,355
about him?

211
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,862
I know you are.

212
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:53,989
-Take a look.
-Five minutes is all.

213
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,199
Come in.

214
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:56,617
-Hurry.
-Hand out the flyers.

215
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,951
Come here.

216
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,079
Focused exercising isn't tiring.

217
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,039
Stop worrying about going on a diet!

218
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,833
The weight will just fall off
if it's with him, right?

219
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,126
Yes!

220
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,212
Exactly. He will...

221
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,881
kindly make eye contact
with everyone...

222
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,966
and give you a nice smile.

223
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,760
What? Would you like to see?

224
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:15,761
Yes.

225
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:16,887
Prepare a smile!

226
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,555
Fire!

227
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,478
We'll accept only 30 people.

228
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:26,146
The first 10 people...

229
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,398
will have him as their client manager.

230
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:29,942
How much is it a month?

231
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,360
Can I start today?

232
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,778
-Of course!
-Of course!

233
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:34,238
No!

234
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,372
We're not doing the diet program,
so leave.

235
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,748
-What is she saying?
-Who is she?

236
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:46,458
I told you to leave!

237
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:47,543
Darn it.

238
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,003
I was so happy.

239
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:50,963
Hey...

240
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:52,339
But...

241
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,968
How dare you use him for business?

242
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,011
You kids.

243
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,597
Do you want to die together?

244
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:04,601
Mr. Kang said he should earn his keep.

245
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,686
Shut it!

246
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:08,230
-He says you should come eat.
-Lunch is ready?

247
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,154
Let's go. Come down.

248
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,199
Okay.

249
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:42,097
Don't cry.

250
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,057
It's okay.

251
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:50,731
You should look where you're going.

252
00:19:57,821 --> 00:19:59,281
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.

253
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,158
Don't be.

254
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,911
I know it was all Shin's doing.

255
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,748
He'll try to kill me again once he's back.

256
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:10,709
I need you.

257
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,546
You need to come protect me,

258
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,049
and run the company.

259
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,717
I can't do that.

260
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,135
You're the only one who can.

261
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,720
Before I die,

262
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,890
I must see M-City.

263
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,102
Only you can...

264
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,026
CHIRMAN NAM GUN-HO

265
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,489
You should tell me that.

266
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,163
The person you have reached...

267
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,416
is not available.
Please leave a message after the tone.

268
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,088
NAM HO-YUN

269
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,510
What is it? Is the chairman okay?

270
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,928
Shin came,

271
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,888
and he locked Dad's bedroom door.

272
00:21:10,644 --> 00:21:13,397
ARICEPT

273
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:16,775
Dementia.

274
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:19,278
It's so not you.

275
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:23,782
You tried to kill me.

276
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:26,201
Get out right now.

277
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,327
Do you have proof?

278
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:28,912
That robot did it.

279
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,540
I told you,

280
00:21:32,374 --> 00:21:33,458
he is just...

281
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,628
a robot that moves
as ordered by a person.

282
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,299
How was it to have
your precious robot try to kill you?

283
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,343
Ho-yun!

284
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,678
Young-hoon!

285
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,555
You told me not to rely on others.

286
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,557
You told me to suspect everyone.

287
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,976
But now, you're asking for help
from others?

288
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,772
My Grandfather's no fun
after getting all weak.

289
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,734
Mr. Chairman! Shin!

290
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:00,110
Let me in! Now!

291
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,367
This contract says
you'll transfer your shares to me.

292
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,994
Sign it.

293
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,789
-Let me in!
-Dad.

294
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:14,082
Dad!

295
00:22:16,209 --> 00:22:17,252
Sign it now.

296
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,422
You will never do.

297
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,965
If not me, then who?

298
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,383
That robot?

299
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,304
Do you think the robot that tried to
kill you will protect you?

300
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:28,722
Dad!

301
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:40,359
STOCK TRANSFER AGREEMENT

302
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:43,320
Come out.

303
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:46,782
Come out!

304
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,705
How far will you go?

305
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,999
I tried to kill my grandfather.
What couldn't I do?

306
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,004
Don't do this.

307
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,757
You went into hiding
because of your guilt.

308
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,094
You can't be fine after doing this.

309
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,012
You're mistaken.

310
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,520
I quit pretending to be a damaged child.

311
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,148
It's annoying to see me hurt
when I'm rich and powerful.

312
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:23,235
How much could I make
from splitting the company?

313
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,611
What should we do with that?

314
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,488
Should I hit you again?

315
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,449
Go ahead. Beat me up, and be on my side.

316
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:32,035
Since you'd be hitting me for me.

317
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:36,039
Whatever the reason may be,

318
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,624
you almost killed a person.

319
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,918
Go to the chairman,
and beg for forgiveness.

320
00:23:40,001 --> 00:23:41,128
No.

321
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,673
I'll send that old man to a nursing home.

322
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:47,384
I'll let him die there...

323
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,554
lonely and sad just like my dad.

324
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,021
You aren't even worth hitting.

325
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:03,150
You should've never woken up.

326
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,783
Hello, sir.

327
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,829
I'll give you a chance to make up...

328
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,249
for not preventing my father's death.

329
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,669
Do your best to help me starting tomorrow.

330
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,297
Thank you, sir.

331
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,216
You won't regret...

332
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:11,468
Was that...

333
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,513
Jong-gil?

334
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:19,059
I didn't expect to see you here.

335
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,273
Did you come to lecture me, too?

336
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,527
"How could you do that?"

337
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:30,487
"You can't do that to your grandfather."

338
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,822
So what Mr. Ji said was true.

339
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,408
You've crossed the line.

340
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:39,829
Jung-woo...

341
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:42,707
He fell while trying to escape...

342
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,210
to see you and Dr. Oh.

343
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,380
Your mother would die of shock
if she found out.

344
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,675
He tried to kill you.

345
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,843
There's nothing he won't do.

346
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,263
How could you try to
kill your grandfather?

347
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,724
Are you becoming like that jerk?

348
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,185
How could you ask
a jerk like that for help?

349
00:26:03,186 --> 00:26:04,854
Jerks like that are the only ones...

350
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,565
willing to help me.

351
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:18,243
Let's go to the Czech Republic.

352
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,371
I'll stay out of your sight if you want.

353
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:25,917
Eat the food I cook,
and sleep in the sheets I wash.

354
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,795
Eat and sleep, enjoy the scenery,

355
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,047
-take walks...
-Go with that robot.

356
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,551
That robot you brought is
about to take my place.

357
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,637
No. I won't go.

358
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:41,349
I left you once. That was enough.

359
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,733
Don't drink.

360
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,110
It'll make your wounds worse.

361
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,696
Give me a break.

362
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,782
If you truly care for me,

363
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,119
get rid of him...

364
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,496
right now.

365
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,516
Why do you work hard at everything?

366
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:25,352
Can you not just wing it?

367
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,647
-It's against the rule...
-I'm sure.

368
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:30,732
You're so different from me.

369
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,489
He'll try to kill me again once he's back.

370
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,366
I need you.

371
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:43,536
Why are you spaced out?
Did the chairman say something?

372
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,164
No.

373
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,999
Then why did you do that earlier?

374
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,251
The kid cried, but you didn't hug him.

375
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:54,005
Normally, you would've
hugged him and been good to him.

376
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,300
I don't know if it's a good thing
to stick to rules.

377
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,552
I can't make a judgment.

378
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:08,269
Liar. You know everything.

379
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,481
-Are you a robot, too?
-That's right.

380
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:13,650
I'm a cyborg with a metal rod in my leg.

381
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,152
We're a Tin Can couple.

382
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:17,987
Tin Can couple?

383
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,491
Tin Can couple?

384
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,703
Is this the emotion
of thinking you're cute?

385
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,664
If you truly care for me,

386
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:30,125
get rid of him...

387
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,919
right now.

388
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,679
CHAMPION GYM

389
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,646
Please sign them.

390
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,733
STOCK TRANSFER AGREEMENT

391
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,290
NAM SHIN

392
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:13,543
NAM SHIN

393
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,342
Mr. Chairman?

394
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,762
I'll do yours.

395
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,120
Listen.

396
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:53,333
Your life became futile
because of your dementia.

397
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,003
You decided to give your company
to your grandson...

398
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:59,506
and move into a nursing home.

399
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,301
That's what you'll tell people,

400
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,844
right?

401
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,977
NAM GUN-HO

402
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,696
It's over between us now.

403
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:26,741
I never want to hear from you again.

404
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,675
I was happy I could serve you,
Mr. Chairman.

405
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,218
I will be...

406
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,929
loyal to Mr. Nam Shin from now on.

407
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,193
Have you heard from Mr. Ji?

408
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:05,572
I guess he has completely
turned his back on you.

409
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,284
If he heard about the chairman,

410
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,245
it'll be even harder
to come back to you.

411
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:14,789
From now on,

412
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,626
you should depend
on me instead of Mr. Ji.

413
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,587
I'll do my best...

414
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,964
to make sure you become chairman...

415
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,424
without any problems.

416
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,871
Dad. Don't go.

417
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,915
I'll take good care of you here.

418
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,625
I'm going.

419
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,169
I must go.

420
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:02,921
Then what about Hee-dong and me?

421
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,756
Shin scares me too much.

422
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,799
I feel like he'll do something to me.

423
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,177
Ye-na.

424
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:13,181
I have no ill feelings towards you.

425
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,142
Take care.

426
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,978
Take care of yourself.

427
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:36,996
Your dad...

428
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,581
and Shin...

429
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,543
destroyed our family.
Are you happy now?

430
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,796
Is it fun?

431
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,801
It wasn't destroyed.

432
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:55,765
Hee-dong.

433
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:59,644
Tell Mommy to hurry up and
sign the Power of Attorney.

434
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,229
I told you, right?

435
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,065
I have very little patience.

436
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,401
Mommy.

437
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,736
I'll do what you want,

438
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,905
so please stop doing this to the child.

439
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,782
Let me apologize on his behalf.

440
00:33:12,865 --> 00:33:13,741
You should go in.

441
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:20,957
What are you doing?

442
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:22,500
Wasn't Grandfather enough?

443
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:23,793
Now, you threaten a child?

444
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,628
What do you mean, "threaten"?

445
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:27,547
I'm doing this for your man.

446
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,133
No. You're ruining him even more.

447
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,553
Leave him alone while I'm being nice.

448
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,430
Or I'll make you regret it.

449
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,575
Hello, Mr. Ji.

450
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:59,454
Grandfather just left.

451
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,039
Where's Shin?

452
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,415
He didn't come out.

453
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,000
He didn't even see Grandfather off.

454
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,545
Thank you for telling me what happened.

455
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:09,380
I'm relying on you.

456
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,090
Please help bring Shin back.

457
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:23,644
Hi.

458
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,064
You really came.

459
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,690
I called and said I would.

460
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,026
I'm sorry, sir.

461
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,528
It's my fault for being
unable to stop Shin.

462
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:33,821
No.

463
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,449
At least you came.

464
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,118
Thank you.

465
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,661
You'll catch a cold.

466
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,246
Let's go up first.

467
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:22,870
It's you.

468
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,456
It's you.

469
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,929
The human Nam Shin
asked Suh Jong-gil for help?

470
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:23,848
That was unexpected.

471
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,100
He will manipulate Shin...

472
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:28,352
and dump him once he gets what he wants.

473
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:31,939
We must stop it before Shin is
destroyed any further.

474
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,025
Is there a way?

475
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:36,986
I have an idea, but I can't do it alone.

476
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,696
Please help me.

477
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,116
I can't.

478
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,494
The human Nam Shin told me...

479
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,247
that I don't even have
the freedom to disappear.

480
00:36:49,916 --> 00:36:51,417
I'm just a machine.

481
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,128
A machine that may hurt people.

482
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,424
I almost killed Grandfather.

483
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:03,137
I almost killed So-bong,
my most precious person.

484
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:07,016
So that's why you hesitated
in front of the chairman.

485
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,686
Shin did a horrible thing.

486
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,940
I think you've been traumatized.

487
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,608
Traumatized?

488
00:37:17,318 --> 00:37:18,819
Was I hurt?

489
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,655
It isn't purely Shin's fault.

490
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,532
I knew you'd be hurt,

491
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,660
but I ignored it because
I thought it'll be okay...

492
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,328
Since you're a robot.

493
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:32,959
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked.

494
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:35,836
I'll figure it out somehow,

495
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,422
so don't ever forgive Shin.

496
00:37:40,341 --> 00:37:42,969
The rule is to help humans.
I'm sorry I can't do that.

497
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,097
I'll go now.

498
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,520
You're not just a machine.

499
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,201
To me, you are...

500
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,872
someone so dependable
that I want to rely on you.

501
00:38:13,207 --> 00:38:14,500
You're a machine,

502
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,336
but you're a special machine with a heart.

503
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,257
Forget what Shin said.

504
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,763
You're a pretty cool guy,

505
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,141
so continue living as you are,

506
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,687
Shin.

507
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:40,860
Thank you, Young-hoon.

508
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,590
What did you and Mr. Ji talk about?

509
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,759
Nothing much.

510
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,598
There you go again. Stop it.

511
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:14,852
Stop being down.
It's not like you to be discouraged.

512
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,729
This isn't attractive.

513
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,607
Tell me before I take back my heart.

514
00:39:20,316 --> 00:39:21,734
What did Mr. Ji say?

515
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,238
The human Nam Shin is
working with Suh Jong-gil.

516
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:28,574
He asked for help, but I refused.

517
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,036
-Why?
-The rule is to help humans, but--

518
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,747
You couldn't judge
whether that rule was good or bad?

519
00:39:36,332 --> 00:39:38,125
When will you finish making that judgment?

520
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,003
Will you just make judgments
in front of a dying child?

521
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:46,008
I think that Grandfather
and the jerk Nam Shin are evil.

522
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,594
But if you help them, I'll let you.

523
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,471
Why?

524
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:53,599
Because it's a good thing to help people.

525
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:58,145
Because even if I can't do it,
you do what's right.

526
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:03,442
That's who you are, and I like that rule.

527
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:08,781
Let's not be discouraged.

528
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,409
It's not a Shin to be a robot.

529
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,993
Don't hide.

530
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,873
Everyone! He's a robot!

531
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,043
Stop that.
What if something happens to you?

532
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,170
It won't,

533
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:26,298
because I'm going to stick to you
like glue.

534
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,718
What do you say? Good?

535
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:32,138
No.

536
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,556
Hey.

537
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,716
I said no.

538
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,136
I'm sorry.

539
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:56,305
I won't do it again.

540
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,476
It's me, Hee-dong.

541
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,311
Why won't you listen to me?

542
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:05,773
You can't get close to cell phones
because of your ICD.

543
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:10,152
It's the robot Shin, not the meanie Shin.

544
00:42:10,611 --> 00:42:13,030
-Right?
-That's right, it's me.

545
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,622
Why are you doing this to a child?

546
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,458
I said I'd give you the Power of Attorney.

547
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,126
Mommy.

548
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,504
He isn't that Shin.

549
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,673
He isn't that meanie Shin.

550
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,716
He's the one who saved my life...

551
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,386
and got revenge on that scary man.

552
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:37,596
It's all thanks to him.

553
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,934
What are you talking about?
"This Shin" and "that Shin"?

554
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,063
When did you change your clothes?

555
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:58,826
You are the owner of PK starting today.

556
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,578
You should take the chairman's office.

557
00:43:02,621 --> 00:43:03,998
You can't do that.

558
00:43:11,088 --> 00:43:12,381
It's too soon.

559
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,634
There are too many people watching.
You should follow the proper procedures.

560
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:20,472
Don't be rash. Wait patiently, sir.

561
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:25,394
This is why I need to
stay by Mr. Nam's side.

562
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,230
Let's do as Mr. Ji says.

563
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:32,276
Wait in my office.
I have a lot to talk with Mr. Ji.

564
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:41,452
Why are you back?
You acted like you'd never return.

565
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:44,663
Considering what you did,
I didn't want to.

566
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:46,290
So why did you come?

567
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,668
I sent Grandfather to a nursing home.

568
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:53,589
See? You caused
trouble because I left you alone.

569
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,884
If you want to cause trouble,
do it when I'm here.

570
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:02,014
Until you break or I get exhausted,

571
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,725
I won't give up.

572
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,606
But let's go visit the chairman.

573
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,193
I'll drag you there even if
you kick and scream.

574
00:44:14,568 --> 00:44:15,611
So keep that in mind.

575
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,673
Why did Mr. Ji return?

576
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:39,510
Do you think he's up to something?

577
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,347
He isn't the type to go back and forth.

578
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:44,431
Why?

579
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,476
Are you afraid he'll get in your way?

580
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,853
You wanted to pretend to help me...

581
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,939
and push me off a cliff later.

582
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,274
Are you afraid you won't be able to?

583
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,653
You still suspect me.

584
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:01,281
I'll stay by your side quietly...

585
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:04,410
until you come to trust me.

586
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:10,124
I'll call a shareholders' meeting
and let them know...

587
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,751
there's a new leader in town.

588
00:45:13,127 --> 00:45:14,878
The chairman's people...

589
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:16,672
will naturally support you.

590
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,382
Right. Do you have...

591
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:22,052
any new plans to present at the meeting?

592
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:24,805
I'll think it over.

593
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,808
I can't wait to hear it, sir.

594
00:45:36,650 --> 00:45:38,193
New plans?

595
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:43,991
An immortal city that is completely
controlled by AI.

596
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,326
M-City.

597
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:49,204
That is my last dream.

598
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,084
M-City?

599
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,545
No? It's taking
a step further than M-Car...

600
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,046
and applying it to a city.

601
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,382
M-City, where humans don't die.

602
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:02,968
Prepare a proposal
for the shareholders meeting.

603
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:06,388
We're overwhelmed
with M-Car's launch as it is.

604
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:08,640
A city would be a huge project.

605
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,434
It's unrealistic.

606
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,061
That's why you should write it
focused on the idea.

607
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,147
Please show us a more exact picture.

608
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:17,191
We were able to proceed
so quickly with M-Car...

609
00:46:17,274 --> 00:46:19,610
because of your nearly perfect plan.

610
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:22,446
You get paid to make
my plans come to life.

611
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:25,449
-Work all night if you must.
-You told us not to work nights.

612
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,659
You told us to spend weekends with family.

613
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,579
Let me make myself clear.

614
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:34,249
The present me wants
only abilities and results.

615
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,044
Don't forget that your time
belongs to the company.

616
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,051
Enjoy.

617
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:48,180
Does Mr. Nam have multiple
personality disorder?

618
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:50,766
How could he be so different?

619
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,726
Do you think he hurt his brain?

620
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:56,396
His personality change is
like a roller coaster ride.

621
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,564
Exactly.

622
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:59,483
He told us not to work nights,

623
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:02,778
and now, what?
"Your time belongs to the company"?

624
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,738
Isn't it really strange?

625
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:07,074
They're completely different people
with the same face.

626
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:10,327
There you go again.
Are you a conspiracy theorist?

627
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,912
Just eat. Eat up,

628
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,915
and let's put together
the Immortal M-City.

629
00:47:15,457 --> 00:47:16,458
Eat up.

630
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,018
-Mr. Nam.
-You're eating lunch late.

631
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,645
I told you to eat on time.

632
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:39,439
Are you...

633
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:48,574
How did it go?

634
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:49,575
It was a success.

635
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:55,664
Did you wait long? Open your mouth.

636
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:05,132
Lawyer Park speaking.

637
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,633
It's Ji Young-hoon.

638
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:09,177
I'd like to see you about
what we discussed yesterday.

639
00:48:09,303 --> 00:48:11,555
You mean the change to
the contract, correct?

640
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,932
Yes. You can come to Yangpyeong.

641
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,684
I'll text you the details.

642
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,493
You're back.

643
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,581
I'm surprised, Mr. Ji.

644
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,751
I thought you'd act noble and leave...

645
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:43,253
once you found out Mr. Nam
was working with me.

646
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:46,465
You weren't acting noble.
Why should I?

647
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,592
Given what happened to the chairman,

648
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:50,719
I must stay closer to Mr. Nam.

649
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,305
You're confusing me like crazy.

650
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:58,518
Mr. Ji. You're not like me.

651
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,812
Not anyone can be like me.

652
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:04,066
You have to suspect family,
friends, and everyone.

653
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,610
You have to believe...

654
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,696
you're the only one in the world
who's on your side.

655
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,114
But...

656
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,326
you don't.

657
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,204
So why are you pretending to be a bad guy?

658
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:21,667
What are you trying to hide?

659
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:24,753
Who knows?

660
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,546
I wonder as well.

661
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,507
What am I hiding?

662
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,810
This is getting interesting.

663
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,370
Why are you so surprised?

664
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:01,957
What is it? Is there
a problem with the server?

665
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,459
How did you know the server was here?

666
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,919
How could I not?

667
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:09,047
This company will belong to me soon.

668
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,134
Tell me if there's a problem.

669
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,886
I'll help you if you let me in.

670
00:50:16,888 --> 00:50:19,349
Even if it's your company,
you can't go in here.

671
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:21,226
I'll just borrow Grandfather's finger.

672
00:50:21,935 --> 00:50:24,896
If not, I'll do whatever it takes
to blow it up.

673
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,858
I can just build another building
for the company.

674
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,651
You're out of control.

675
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:33,780
I pity your mom and that kid
for suffering by you.

676
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:36,575
That isn't something new.

677
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:39,411
I knew her for 20 years.

678
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:43,623
I'm the one who took photos
of you for your mom.

679
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,379
That's how she got to watch you grow up.

680
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:52,007
Do you know why
your mom made him that way?

681
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:56,553
A lie detector.
The rule to cry someone who cries.

682
00:50:56,970 --> 00:50:58,013
Disaster Mode.

683
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,015
A waterproof system.

684
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,350
Does it sound familiar?

685
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,645
What are you getting at?

686
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:07,898
You hated people who lied.

687
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,025
You hugged your mom whenever she cried.

688
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,194
You liked to swim with your mom.

689
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,321
And you wanted to become a firefighter.

690
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:16,990
That was you.

691
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,743
She missed you so much...

692
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,287
that she puts those abilities into him.

693
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,667
Don't insult your mom's love
for you anymore.

694
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,045
She loved him,

695
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,339
but that was her love for you.

696
00:51:47,312 --> 00:51:49,397
Yes. You can come to Yangpyeong.

697
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,024
I'll text you the details.

698
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:53,985
Where's the chairman's
nursing home again?

699
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:56,279
It's in Yangpyeong.

700
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,698
Turn the car around.

701
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,200
Now!

702
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,477
Look at you.

703
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,020
You did it to yourself.

704
00:52:29,896 --> 00:52:31,731
You deserve this.

705
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:34,151
Why did you have to be so cruel?

706
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:37,028
Taking from others...

707
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,656
and stepping on anyone
who took anything from you.

708
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,784
Do you know how degrading it was...

709
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,120
every time you slapped me?

710
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,331
I felt like I wasn't a human being,

711
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,333
but a lowly animal.

712
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:53,920
I'll live happily with Shin.

713
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,381
You stay here quietly.

714
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,343
Shin will be here soon,

715
00:53:01,219 --> 00:53:02,721
so don't ever tell him...

716
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:04,764
that I said this.

717
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,178
Did he leave?

718
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,388
Yes. He was totally fooled.

719
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,558
How could he know
that you lured him here?

720
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:54,481
You look like the real Shin again.

721
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:57,192
Take a good look.

722
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,527
This is the last time.

723
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,080
You came here first, sir.

724
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:12,999
Do I really have to be here
to revise the contract?

725
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,670
The chairman is here, too.
Please be patient.

726
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:19,881
How do you wish to revise the contract?

727
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:22,008
It's bothersome, so talk with Mr. Ji.

728
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:37,607
Don't insult your mom's love
for you anymore.

729
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:39,859
She loved him,

730
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,195
but that love was meant for you.

731
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:57,502
Shin. Is that you?

732
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:10,265
You look more beautiful than ever today.

733
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,476
Be quiet. Don't get in my way,
and get out.

734
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:16,521
You don't even know
whom you should thank.

735
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,108
-What was that?
-I didn't say anything.

736
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:25,322
Shin called and asked me to come.

737
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:27,574
I don't know why I'm worried.

738
00:55:28,575 --> 00:55:30,327
I'm nervous about being excited.

739
00:55:30,577 --> 00:55:34,497
It is sudden, but it's a good thing.
Just go see him.

740
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,042
I'm sure he wants to talk.

741
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,924
SUH JONG-GIL

742
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,284
Hello.

743
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:14,204
I'm PK Group's senior managing director,
Suh Jong-gil.

744
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:16,956
Thank you for coming during
your busy schedules.

745
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:19,459
Today is an important day...

746
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:23,004
on which PK Group will
get a new leader.

747
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:26,174
Unfortunately,
Chairman Nam Gun-Ho developed dementia,

748
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,011
and the person who will be
replacing him is...

749
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,515
Mr. Nam Shin.

750
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:47,028
Mr. Nam Shin is giving his all...

751
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,988
in PK Group's future business,

752
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:52,409
the self-driving car business.

753
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:54,994
He successfully launched...

754
00:56:55,161 --> 00:56:56,788
M-Car and MediCar.

755
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:59,165
He also has a grand vision...

756
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:01,501
called M-City for the future.

757
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:03,586
Particularly, MediCar, which combines...

758
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,381
medical functionality
with a self-driving car,

759
00:57:06,840 --> 00:57:09,676
is making a big wave in the industry.

760
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:24,315
Everyone,

761
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:26,651
here is Mr. Nam Shin,

762
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:29,279
who made MediCar a success!

763
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:32,365
Wait.

764
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,952
Young-hoon, what are you doing?

765
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:38,913
The person who created MediCar...

766
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:43,001
was not Mr. Nam Shin.

767
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,050
He is...

768
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,845
another Mr. Nam Shin.

769
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:55,597
"Another Nam Shin"?

770
00:57:56,389 --> 00:57:58,057
-What does that mean?
-Young-hoon!

771
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,225
What do you think you're doing?

772
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,499
-It's really him.
-Who's the real Nam Shin?

773
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:41,601
Hello. I planned and
launched MediCar.

774
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,062
I'm an AI robot, Nam Shin 3.

775
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:21,808
How could you do this to me?

776
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:23,893
At least give me an excuse!

777
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:27,897
It's a plane ticket to the Czech Republic.
Go with me.

778
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,567
Are you insane?

779
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,484
DISMISSAL OF SUH JONG-GIL

780
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:33,528
I started this to finish everything.

781
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:34,696
Try sitting here!

782
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,447
You jerk! Seriously...

783
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,908
A kill switch? So there was a way.

784
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,035
A way to get rid of that thing.

785
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:47,000
