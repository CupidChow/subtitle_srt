1
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,492
The child I gave birth to,

2
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,494
and the child I created.

3
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,628
A kill switch is like death for humans.

4
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:47,881
Why did you build...

5
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,632
Because if the real Shin wakes up,

6
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,887
the fake Shin needs to disappear.

7
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:55,972
I thought...

8
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,016
I had no choice even
if I had to destroy you.

9
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,685
I'm Shin, too, Mom.

10
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,357
Don't be hurt.

11
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,319
You said you'd do anything I ask.

12
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,155
If that's just a robot to you,

13
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,823
you shouldn't care what happens to it.

14
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,785
Do you care more about that too...

15
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:18,495
like Grandfather does?

16
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,748
Or did you live with it for too long
to let it go?

17
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,625
I was wrong.

18
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,086
How can I get you to let me go?

19
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,670
What do you really want from me?

20
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,798
Disappear.

21
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,218
Do you know how disgusting it is
to see my own face?

22
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,303
Just disappear.

23
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,847
Get out of my face right this instant!

24
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,850
Back away.

25
00:01:41,476 --> 00:01:42,852
I'd rather disappear...

26
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,230
than harm humans.

27
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,900
I must stop them both...

28
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,152
from being destroyed.

29
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,751
STOP KILL SWITCH

30
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,586
Shin...

31
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,713
has the kill switch?

32
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,800
Yes. I think he's going to do something.

33
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,969
We were going to a construction site,

34
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,054
but I was abducted.

35
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,472
Dr. Oh.

36
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:21,724
Please stop Shin.

37
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,899
It hasn't been completed yet.

38
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,484
What should I do?

39
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:35,029
STOP KILL SWITCH
PAUSE

40
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:50,211
Shin.

41
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:52,630
-Mom.
-Please.

42
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,968
I'll stop it.

43
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,517
I'll protect you.

44
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:06,936
BOOTING

45
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,153
SEARCHING
MOTHER

46
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,405
I can see clearly.

47
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,850
Why am I having this dream only now?

48
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:48,895
I'm happy.

49
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,858
Goodbye, my sons.

50
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,037
Mom.

51
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,500
Mom, don't die.

52
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,462
Mom.

53
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:16,756
Mom?

54
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,057
Mom.

55
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,822
I'm contacting you just in case.

56
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,616
Come to the abandoned factory in Incheon.

57
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:54,252
I'M CONTACTING YOU JUST IN CASE

58
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:03,428
AI ROBOT NAM SHIN 3 ARRESTED
ON MURDER CHARGE

59
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:04,762
Murder?

60
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,223
What's this?

61
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:09,225
So-bong!

62
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:12,061
Dr. David.

63
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,647
I saw that on my way, too.

64
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,024
Let's go in.

65
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:26,868
Dr. Oh.

66
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,954
-Mom won't breathe.
-What happened?

67
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,915
Mom stopped the kill switch,
but she won't breathe.

68
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:34,792
It's all my fault.

69
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,964
-Take him out of here.
-What?

70
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,133
Who knows what they'll do to him?

71
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,051
Go hide somewhere.

72
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,263
-Let's go.
-Mom.

73
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,516
Go! You said this happened to Mom
while saving you.

74
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:52,352
For her sake, just go.

75
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,313
Let's go.

76
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,284
Was this why?

77
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,622
Was this why you thanked me?

78
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,458
Was this why?

79
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,462
I said you didn't have to like me.

80
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,967
I told you to just let me stay with you.

81
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,099
You're so mean.

82
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,438
You're such a terrible woman.

83
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:46,572
Please...

84
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,809
SUH JONG-GIL

85
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,398
Are you okay, sir?

86
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:23,234
I was shocked to hear Dr. Oh's news.

87
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,571
News? What about her?

88
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,283
Haven't you heard yet?

89
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:32,910
That robot lost its mind.

90
00:07:33,244 --> 00:07:36,456
It lost control and...

91
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,623
It lost control?

92
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,585
What did that jerk do to Mom? Tell me.

93
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,094
What's wrong?

94
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,472
Did something happen to Mom?

95
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,854
She passed away.

96
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,233
What?

97
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,153
AI CEO
WAS IT PK'S MISTAKE?

98
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:10,114
-This is terrible.
-Why did it kill a person?

99
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,825
IT WASN'T HIS FIRST
VIOLENT ACT

100
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,871
-That's so scary.
- know, right?

101
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,607
FUNERAL PARLOR

102
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,487
I can't go in.

103
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,576
Okay. Come in
after you calm down a little.

104
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,424
Shin.

105
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,011
Can you see me?

106
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,556
It's Mom.

107
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,068
Shin.

108
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:14,447
What must I do to get closer to you?

109
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:18,701
Do I make you uncomfortable?

110
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:31,922
Shin.

111
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,508
Come over, and eat what I cooked.

112
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,345
I'll wait until you come.

113
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,433
Let's go to the Czech Republic.

114
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,978
I'll stay out of your sight if you want.

115
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:50,608
Eat the food I cook,
and sleep in the sheets I wash.

116
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:54,528
Eat and sleep, enjoy the scenery,
and go on walks...

117
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,698
Shin. Please...

118
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,870
Why is that punk crying?

119
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:47,373
He's breaking his mom's heart.

120
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,376
Did they question you?

121
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,212
I wish they'd just say I did it,

122
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,632
but there's a witness
that insists it was him.

123
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:00,886
They're dying to say
the son killed his mom.

124
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,930
To people,

125
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:05,516
he's not a son.
He's just a machine.

126
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,519
You're right.

127
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,899
It happened whileÂ the kill switch
was activated.

128
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,027
He couldn't move,
so she was protecting him.

129
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:26,036
Suh Jong-gil told Shin of Dr. Oh's death.

130
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:29,248
We need to suspect him.

131
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,212
Thanks...

132
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,715
for believing it wasn't Shin.

133
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:43,304
It was because he showed me things.

134
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,934
THE VICTIM OF THE MURDER
WAS THE AI CREATOR

135
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,909
It was Dad.

136
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,411
I'm sure it was Dad.

137
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,416
DAD

138
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,129
FIRST SKY AIR
PASSENGER TICKET

139
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:20,174
What is this?

140
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,134
Take a trip somewhere.

141
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,886
The longer, the better.

142
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,429
Why should I?

143
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,598
I don't want to leave.

144
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,102
I heard about Dr. Oh.

145
00:13:33,312 --> 00:13:34,647
What happened?

146
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:38,150
Did the robot really do that?

147
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,696
Why? Do you think I did it?

148
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:45,574
What? No.

149
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,411
I don't want you to be upset
because of Shin.

150
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:50,955
You're my daughter.

151
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:55,125
When you've calmed down
and moved on, come back.

152
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,712
My people will take good care
of you until then.

153
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,673
You're leaving tomorrow.

154
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,466
Tomorrow?

155
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,680
Fine. I'll start packing.

156
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,439
Ye-na.

157
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:19,775
Yes?

158
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,862
I'm fine.

159
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,321
I was just dizzy.

160
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:31,120
She got weak because of Shin.

161
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,374
Is he okay?

162
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,837
We all know he didn't do it.

163
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,756
So-bong, give him a message for us.

164
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,258
Tell him we believe him.

165
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,927
-So-bong.
-Give me that. Come on.

166
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:50,180
He isn't the type of robot
that would do that!

167
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,850
Thank you, all of you.

168
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,143
So-bong.

169
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,937
Just running away isn't always right.

170
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,648
You need to stay alert...

171
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:01,650
and figure out what you need to do.

172
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,445
And comfort him.

173
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,654
You've had a good life here.

174
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:51,116
Dad, Joint, and Robocop say
they believe you.

175
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,373
How long will you stay like this?

176
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,084
Look at me.

177
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,461
I keep seeing Mom.

178
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:04,588
You see her?

179
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,966
What do you mean?

180
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,515
Mom keeps dying.

181
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,101
Continuously.

182
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,437
You've been watching that all this time?

183
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,274
Don't do that.

184
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,110
Don't blame yourself.

185
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,612
It wasn't your fault.

186
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,241
Dr. Oh would be very sad...

187
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,118
if you keep doing that.

188
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,001
I'm okay.

189
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,588
I'm crying for you since you can't.

190
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:50,050
Tears...

191
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,369
I want to cry...

192
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,289
like a human.

193
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:27,963
I'll hug you...

194
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,800
since your heart is crying.

195
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,966
You got rid of the robot...

196
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,718
everyone feared.

197
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,931
It took me killing Oh Laura
to achieve this.

198
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,059
Young-hoon is the only one left now.

199
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,230
Once he hands over the chairman's shares,

200
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,440
it's game over!

201
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,860
Do you think he'd give them up
that easily?

202
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,948
You know his weakness.

203
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,367
If I take Shin hostage and threaten him,

204
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,202
he'll give up everything.

205
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,915
We'll go after him tomorrow.

206
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:53,966
Future General Director.

207
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,425
Yes, Chairman Suh.

208
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:15,654
Dr. Oh.

209
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:19,867
He didn't...

210
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,327
do that to her.

211
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,414
I thought you should know.

212
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,083
The video of him attacking So-bong...

213
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,127
was on the news last night.

214
00:19:32,838 --> 00:19:34,548
I'm sure Suh Jong-gil was involved.

215
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,679
I'll go to the office and be right back.

216
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,990
KANG SO-BONG

217
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,575
This is Nam Shin 3.

218
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,411
I need to tell you something about Mom.

219
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:24,014
If you want to see me, come here.

220
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,599
DR DAVID

221
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:30,896
So-bong, it's me.

222
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:32,064
Is he okay?

223
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,649
It's me, David.

224
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,776
So-bong is still asleep.

225
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,695
My son. You're alive.

226
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:40,405
Are you okay?

227
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,866
The kill switch was totally
taken care of, right?

228
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,371
Why aren't you talking?
Is there a problem?

229
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,622
Tell me.

230
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,250
11 hours and 12 minutes.

231
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,586
The kill switch was reactivated.

232
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:55,545
What?

233
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,800
-Come to the house. Let me check.
-I need to see the human Nam Shin.

234
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,760
I'll tell So-bong myself.

235
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,637
Don't be stupid, and get over there.

236
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,264
You can see Shin later.

237
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,807
It's important to me.

238
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:07,933
What is?

239
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,479
What's so important?

240
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,690
I'm going to see the human Nam Shin.

241
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,525
So that he can attack you again?

242
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:18,652
-Don't go.
-I have to go.

243
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,821
Don't you realize how dangerous it is?

244
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,240
If they catch you, you're done!

245
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:26,576
The human Nam Shin needs to know
about Mom's death.

246
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,829
I'll be back.

247
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,751
PK GROUP

248
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:42,009
Forget the greetings.

249
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,469
What will you do about
the plummeting stock price?

250
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:47,723
A robot CEO never made sense
to start with.

251
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:49,766
You're the agent.

252
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,393
Did you make it kill her?

253
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,604
Is it true the chairman wanted the robot?

254
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:55,897
He has dementia.

255
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,192
So many of our shareholders are here.

256
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,620
I'm glad you're here.

257
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:14,291
Too many strange things happen
with you gone.

258
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,752
Thank you for saying that.

259
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,462
I've been dismissed,

260
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,797
but I couldn't just watch
my long-term company...

261
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,007
go down in flames.

262
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,137
I told you...

263
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:30,140
that the robot is dangerous...

264
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,434
and not to let it get involved
in the company.

265
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:36,063
I do not believe he murdered anyone.

266
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:39,232
The investigation results aren't
out yet either.

267
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:40,734
What? "He"?

268
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,904
You haven't come to your senses yet.

269
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,697
Get rid of him right now.

270
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,075
If he did not commit murder,

271
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,786
the person who'd gain the most from this
is the killer.

272
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,668
And who would that be?

273
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,255
If you want to blame me,

274
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,548
I'll accept it.

275
00:23:03,632 --> 00:23:05,801
And I will forfeit
the chairman's shares...

276
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,677
to Mr. Nam Shin.

277
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:14,768
The company cannot go to the scumbag...

278
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,436
who should never have it.

279
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,088
Let's go.

280
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,418
It's Dr. David.

281
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,300
Hi.

282
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,594
It didn't stop. It was delayed.

283
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,971
You have a little over eight hours left.

284
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:36,141
You'll keep losing power as time passes.

285
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,435
Come here after you see Shin.

286
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,936
I'll do something.

287
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,938
Okay, I will.

288
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,112
Is he worried about the watch?

289
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,114
I have an extra.

290
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,075
No. He wants us to rush
because he misses me.

291
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,619
We'll be there soon.

292
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:59,080
Be quick, okay? I'll wait outside.

293
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:11,218
AUDIO RECORDING

294
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,720
-You're leaving tomorrow.
-Tomorrow?

295
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:21,019
Fine. I'll start packing.

296
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,778
Ye-na.

297
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,239
Yes?

298
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,157
I'm fine.

299
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,247
It took me killing Oh Laura
to achieve this.

300
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:43,583
Young-hoon is the only one left now.

301
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:47,629
Once he hands over the chairman's shares,

302
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:50,048
it's game over!

303
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:53,552
Do you think he'd give them up
that easily?

304
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,054
You know his weakness.

305
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,431
If I take Shin hostage and threaten him,

306
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,016
he'll give up everything.

307
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,398
SHIN

308
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,736
Please pick up.

309
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,449
Please hurry.
We have to get to the airport.

310
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:25,166
Mr. Ji. I think something
happened to Shin.

311
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,720
-Be careful with it.
-Yes, ma'am.

312
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,816
Shin.

313
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,862
MS. SUH

314
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:57,032
Did you get in touch with Shin?

315
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,285
My dad is the one...

316
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,537
who killed Dr. Oh.

317
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,256
They want you to come
to the chairman's office.

318
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,508
The chairman's office?

319
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:38,740
Don't be like that.

320
00:27:39,449 --> 00:27:42,243
I'm just sitting here
and remembering him.

321
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,080
-You killed Dr. Oh, didn't you?
-I don't know.

322
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:48,166
I don't really feel like
answering that question.

323
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:49,709
What did you do to Shin?

324
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,686
Where is he?

325
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,188
Where is he?

326
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:14,275
Give me the chairman's shares...

327
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,277
unless you want Shin dead.

328
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,448
You animal...

329
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:22,575
I'm not an animal.

330
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,953
I'm a demon.

331
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,918
Will you sign it or not?

332
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,254
I can decide only after you decide.

333
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,047
STOCK TRANSFER AGREEMENT

334
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,300
I'm warning you.

335
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,886
Don't act smart in front of me.

336
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:45,056
If you say you'll sign only if I bring...

337
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,891
Shin to you or something,

338
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:51,479
that punk will end up joining his mom.

339
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,780
Police.

340
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,659
You need to come with us
regarding Oh Laura's murder.

341
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,995
We need to question you
for controlling the robot.

342
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,246
Not now.

343
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,289
I'll go later.

344
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,124
The public is enraged,
so we have no choice.

345
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,292
Come with us.

346
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:17,464
You won't get your way. You'll see.

347
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,184
Did he...

348
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:31,186
sign it?

349
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,270
Yes.

350
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,733
To think, my dream came true
by a sheet of paper.

351
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,401
It feels so empty.

352
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,998
What should I do with Nam Shin?

353
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:53,750
He keeps fighting back.

354
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,462
I have to kill Shin myself
just like his mom.

355
00:29:57,754 --> 00:29:58,963
I'll come, so wait.

356
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,021
Shin.

357
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,822
CHAMPION GYM

358
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,790
It's Dr. David again.

359
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,169
What is it?

360
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:44,342
Based on Dr. Oh's data, there's hope.

361
00:30:45,343 --> 00:30:46,719
I need the chip in your neck.

362
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:49,305
You have less than four hours.
Get over here now.

363
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:58,815
What is this?

364
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,484
Did the kill switch get reactivated?

365
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,196
When did you know?

366
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,364
Early this morning.

367
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,741
I didn't tell you because you'd worry.

368
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,119
That's why you should've told me!

369
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:17,208
-Let's go back right now.
-We're already here.

370
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,628
I need to tell the human Nam Shin
something.

371
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,133
Make it as brief as possible.

372
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,509
Let's go.

374
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,403
Someone else...

375
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,698
killed Dr. Oh.

377
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:59,250
It took me killing Oh Laura
to achieve this.

378
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,545
Young-hoon is the only one left now.

379
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:06,090
Once he hands over the chairman's shares,

380
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,927
it's game over!

00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,641
Don't look at me like that.

383
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,893
I only did what had to be done.

384
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,103
I'll thank you after I find Shin.

385
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:43,294
I don't think he's coming.

386
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,463
We don't have time. Let's go.

387
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,677
Hello, Mr. Ji.

388
00:32:55,014 --> 00:32:56,224
He wants to talk with you.

389
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:01,145
Hi, Young-hoon.

390
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,816
Please track Shin.
Suh Jong-gil abducted him.

392
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,744
I've located Nam Shin and Mr. Suh.

393
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,871
I'll send you the address and head there.

394
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,708
What was that about?

395
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:24,627
-Go where?
-The human Nam Shin may die.

396
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:25,545
I need to go.

397
00:33:27,213 --> 00:33:29,424
No. You need to go to Dr. David.

398
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,395
I'll be back.

399
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,231
-Wait here.
-Are you insane?

400
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:49,610
He activated your kill switch.
He did this to you.

401
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,738
Why would you go there?

402
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:52,905
I have to go.

403
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:57,660
You know that too, So-bong.

404
00:33:57,744 --> 00:33:59,454
No, I don't.

405
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:01,831
Time keeps passing.

406
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:06,502
Your time keeps getting shorter.

407
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,759
You're in greater danger.
Who cares if he dies?

408
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,512
I'll bring the human Nam Shin...

409
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,806
very soon.

410
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,979
What about me?

411
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,780
Am I nothing to you?

412
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,657
What if I never see you again?

413
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:39,577
What if you go like this...

414
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,247
and your time expires?

415
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,250
What do I do then?

416
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,306
Go with me.

417
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:02,475
Please.

418
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,479
You know I can't live without you.

419
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:08,815
Please.

420
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,204
So-bong.

421
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:28,209
When Mom died before my eyes,

422
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,837
I couldn't do anything.

423
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,507
If the human Nam Shin dies now,

424
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,885
I'll keep remembering her dying.

425
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,639
It's my rule to help humans.

426
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:46,144
Help me stick to that rule.

427
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,061
No.

428
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,730
I don't want to.

429
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,237
I promise to come back.

430
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,699
I'm your robot after all.

431
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,838
I'll go with you...

432
00:36:15,631 --> 00:36:17,049
wherever the end may be.

433
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:34,525
You must be thinking of your late parents.

434
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,654
They were very good people.

435
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,491
You should be with them.
It's better for you.

436
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,913
A family should be together.

437
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,134
Who are you?

438
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:35,419
Tell your dad that I said hi.

439
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,049
Why did you come here?

440
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,094
Was it out of guilt
from what you did to Mom?

441
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,098
He didn't do that to Dr. Oh.

442
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:33,519
Regardless, why did you come here?

443
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,522
To relay Mom's message.

444
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:38,733
What message?

445
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:41,610
She said...

446
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:44,363
she was sorry
for leaving you alone again.

447
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,710
Give him the watch.

448
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,510
-What's this?
-Pretend to be me.

449
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:09,930
Take him, So-bong.

450
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,602
You have to come right away, okay?

451
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,997
It wasn't your fault.

452
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,543
It's my fault Mom died,

453
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,962
so don't blame yourself.

454
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,258
Thank you,

455
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,177
Shin.

456
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,065
What? Are you afraid?

457
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,069
I said I'd do exactly
what you do to my people.

458
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:49,321
You punk.

459
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,739
Do as you wish.

460
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,617
You can't kill people anyway!

461
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,330
This is the final bullet.

462
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,682
Don't play with people's lives again.

463
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,201
You'll keep losing power as time passes.

464
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,084

The police are coming. Stay here.

It's dangerous for you, too, so stay here.

471
00:42:22,581 --> 00:42:24,583
It's dangerous for us, but not for him?

Do you know
what that robot you tried to destroy

473
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,504
gave up to come here?

-What?
-Stop whining.

476
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:15,467
Isn't that Nam Shin?

477
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:17,303
How...

478
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,513
Get him!

479
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:20,973
Stop right there!

Get him!

481
00:43:39,825 --> 00:43:40,659
Go that way.

482
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,457
-There he is!
-Over there!

483
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:00,596
So-bong. Where is he?

484
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:02,097
He wasn't there?

485
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,349
Mr. Suh was with him.

486
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,561
I found a way
to deactivate the kill switch.

487
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,188
He has less than 10 minutes.

488
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,065
He must have lost a lot of power.

489
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,316
Let's check there.

490
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,084
If you're Nam Shin,

491
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:14,670
I'll kill you.

492
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,513
Check his wrist.

493
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,408
It is Nam Shin.

494
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,505
Hey. Give me that.

495
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,347

00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:16,620
How are you feeling?

502
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,622
I keep exercising...

503
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,750
out of boredom, so I got healthier.

504
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:25,671
How's the company?

505
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,005
The chairman's...

506
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,341
inauguration is today.

507
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:33,303
You should've been there.

508
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,722
It's all because of that robot.

509
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:39,726
Until the moment
that robot fell into the ocean,

510
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,395
I thought it was really Shin.

511
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:45,023
The times I spent with him...

512
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,192
were the most thrilling...

513
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,653
in my entire life.

514
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:52,364
Ms. Suh...

515
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,284
hardly leaves her mother's home in Boston.

516
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,497
She must feel guilty
for doing this to you.

517
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:02,833
Should I...

518
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,793
contact her?

519
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:42,330
CHAIRMAN JI YOUNG-HOON

520
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,624
Bro. I'm here.

521
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:50,964
Took you long enough.

522
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,467
Shouldn't you stop traveling now?

523
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,554
You look good sitting there.

524
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,222
You look like you belong there.

525
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:02,434
It's only temporary.

526
00:51:02,934 --> 00:51:05,479
-Come back.
-You keep doing it.

527
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,065
If I take over, I'll sell the company.

528
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,612
How's So-bong?

529
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:15,280
Is she okay?

530
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:17,949
I couldn't ask.

531
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,368
I didn't want to reopen her wounds.

532
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,034
Are you sleeping already?

533
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:02,661
Why aren't you picking up?

534
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:04,704
I'm not sleeping.

535
00:52:07,082 --> 00:52:08,416
Please call me.

536
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,378
Friend, I'll be there soon.

537
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:12,712
Get ready, and come out.

538
00:52:13,421 --> 00:52:15,882
You said you'll be here soon.
Why aren't you here yet?

539
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:28,228
If you don't pick up,
I have to track you via GPS.

540
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:29,980
But I won't...

541
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:32,899
since you may want to be alone.

542
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,784
I don't want to be alone.

543
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:46,788
I miss you,

544
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:48,623
my robot.

545
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,863
It's the only food we ate together.

546
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:22,616
Isn't it delicious?

547
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,412
I'll be back.

548
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:30,624
Don't be lonely.

549
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:36,338
Maibo, say bye to Shin.

550
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,689
Maibo! Oh, no.

551
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:03,740
I'm sorry.

552
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:06,451
I thought you broke.

553
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:10,997
I'm sorry I can't understand you.

554
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,750
I'm sorry I'm a robot.

555
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,337
No. Don't be sorry for being a robot.

556
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,800
I'm sorry I'm a robot,

557
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,677
So-bong.

558
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:43,738
You still get confused?

559
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:48,076
What's your problem?
Why are you messing with me?

560
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:49,828
You still miss him.

561
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,664
I was being nice to let you think
I was him.

562
00:54:52,831 --> 00:54:55,458
What? Being nice?

563
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,503
You jerk.

564
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:04,384
Sorry.

565
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,803
I came to pay him my respects, too.

566
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,020
Evil jerk.

567
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,647
Stupid jerk.

568
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,362
Are you very angry?

569
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:20,668
The rule is to hug you if you cry.

570
00:56:37,477 --> 00:56:38,686
Is it...

571
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:41,022
Is it really you?

572
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:42,816
Yes, So-bong.

573
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,734
It's me.

574
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:48,988
It can't be.

575
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,283
How... How is this possible?

576
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,874
Is it... Is it really you?

577
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,627
Is it really you?

578
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:15,849
I couldn't have found him
if it weren't for you guys.

579
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,976
It was thanks to Shin's money and power.

580
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:19,894
Money and power.

581
00:57:21,813 --> 00:57:23,773
It was the first time
I enjoyed using them.

582
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,738
Dr. Oh would've been happy
to hear you say that.

583
00:57:32,991 --> 00:57:35,869
It was worth the long effort
in fixing you, my son.

584
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,894
Most of my abilities are gone now.

585
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,230
I'm close to an average human now.

586
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,983
It's okay.

587
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,944
You've gotten closer to me.

588
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,532
I became more like you.

589
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,411
My heart won't change anymore.

590
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,539
Just like a robot.

591
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:19,032
