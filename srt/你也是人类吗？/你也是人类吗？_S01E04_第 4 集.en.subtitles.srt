1
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,017
Where is she going?

2
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,642
It's Mom.

3
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:43,228
Shin.

4
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,111
My son. You're incredible.

5
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,363
Would you please...

6
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,282
call me "Mommy" again?

7
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,871
Shin. Wake up. It's Mom.

8
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,414
Shin, please.

9
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,168
Shin, I have a favor to ask.

10
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:09,170
Go to Seoul,

11
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,882
and protect Shin's position.

12
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:35,697
I'll take the patient to the VIP suite
when he arrives.

13
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:37,031
Take her up there first.

14
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,908
Thank you.

15
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,036
Are you going to see Mom?

16
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:44,914
It's a company matter.

17
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,458
I'll let you see your mom soon.

18
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:52,338
Why did he lieÂ when he was going
to see Mom?

19
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,121
Did you see?

20
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,165
He looked just like you.

21
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,417
The human Nam Shin.

22
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,253
Right now, I am that human.

23
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:33,504
No, I didn't.

24
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:36,716
Someone looks just like me?
That's ridiculous.

25
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,967
Why are you here?

26
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,303
What?

27
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,274
I followed you.

28
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,485
I heard Mr. Ji on the phone.

29
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,487
He told someone to meet him at PK Hospital

30
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,364
and to think only about seeing Shin.

31
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,615
That's why.

32
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,038
He did?

33
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:09,666
Yes. I couldn't see you,

34
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,377
so I assumed you came here with Mr. Ji

35
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,337
to meet the person he was talking to.

36
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:15,755
Where is Mr. Ji?

37
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:20,843
You're lying again.

38
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,764
Is your hand a lie detector or something?

39
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,016
-How did you know?
-Stop mocking me.

40
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,601
Mr. Nam.

41
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,112
Why are you two here?
I saw two of his cars.

42
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,864
I'm sorry. I rushed out, so I took one.

43
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,367
You can explain later at home.
Get the car back.

44
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:46,786
Let's go, sir.

45
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,761
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

46
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,680
I told you to be cautious of her.

47
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,558
If you knew she was following me,
you should've called.

48
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,149
Only humans can make judgments like that.
I'm sorry.

49
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:20,153
-It's my fault for not instructing you.
-Why did you lie to me?

50
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,242
You said you were going to the office,
but you were meeting my mom.

51
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,245
You didn't tell me the human Nam Shin
came to Korea.

52
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,496
Young-hoon...

53
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,375
are you a human I can trust, or not?

54
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,176
You must be mistaken.

55
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,219
You are not the real Shin.

56
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,598
I don't care if you trust me or not,
just do as you're told.

57
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,773
-What are you doing?
-Learning by example.

58
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:59,901
I copied what you did
because I'm not done talking.

59
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,283
So-bong saw the human Nam Shin.

60
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,745
-What?
-He looks just like him.

61
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:13,998
He was going into the ER, but he looked--

62
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,542
Where did the woman in the photo go?

63
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,008
I don't know.

64
00:06:24,092 --> 00:06:27,470
-I'm sure I saw someone--
-So-bong.

65
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,348
-Yes?
-Stop talking nonsense.

66
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,976
Shin doesn't have a brother,
let alone a twin.

67
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,814
True, it doesn't makes sense.

68
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:39,690
I must've seen it wrong.

69
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,029
Anyway, good work.

70
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,574
I sent the money.
Call me if you see her again.

71
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:50,076
Who is she?

72
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,079
It's best you don't know.

73
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,288
I'll be in touch.

74
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:02,338
Why do you think his mother came
after 20 years?

75
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:04,966
Do you think she missed her son?

76
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:08,386
Then she should go to Shin,
not Young-hoon.

77
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,394
Laura and Young-hoon.

78
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:20,231
What are you two up to?

79
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:39,584
You should wait until I open the door.
We practiced this.

80
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,890
Let's go in.

81
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,144
Why did you do it?

82
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,938
What were you trying to find
by following me?

83
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:02,648
I was nervous.

84
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,568
I really like it here.

85
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,404
The pay is good, and it looks cool.

86
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,657
But I was given only one month.

87
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,286
I was wondering how to impress Mr. Nam,

88
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,165
and I happened to overhear your call.

89
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,751
It sounded like someone
was meeting Mr. Nam,

90
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,461
but you went instead.

91
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,422
Were you up to something?

92
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,257
It would help me if you were.

93
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,386
I wanted to find something
to impress Mr. Nam.

94
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,055
That's why.

95
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,768
I was so desperate that I saw things.

96
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,564
I saw a patient
who looked just like Mr. Nam.

97
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,858
It's absurd, isn't it?

98
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:51,364
I wish such a person existed.

99
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,408
I'd have him replace
the troublemaker Mr. Nam.

100
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,580
Just focus on guarding him from now on.

101
00:09:00,873 --> 00:09:03,709
Okay. Again, I'm sorry.

102
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:12,260
You want to move Shin tomorrow?

103
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,638
What do you mean?
The equipment isn't there yet.

104
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,811
Luckily, she thinks she was mistaken,
but let's hurry.

105
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:24,897
-After the most basic tests--
-He's too unstable.

106
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:28,109
His breathing and pulse are stable
but not blood pressure or temperature.

107
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,360
Someone saw Shin.

108
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,363
Let's move tomorrow as Young-hoon says.

109
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,492
If you want to ignore
the doctor's opinion, go ahead.

110
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:41,622
Gosh. Doctor.

111
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,418
When should we move him?

112
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,878
I'll go tomorrow.

113
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:50,214
Take care of whatever is necessary.

114
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,886
The line is currently in use.

115
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,223
Please leave a message after the tone.

116
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,571
The line is currently in use.

117
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:16,949
Please leave a message after the tone.

118
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:26,811
What is he doing now?

119
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:50,418
Why is he going under?

120
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:11,063
Why isn't he coming up yet?

121
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,754
Mr. Nam!

122
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:01,822
You scared me!

123
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,874
You're telling the truth this time.

124
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:24,512
Whatever.

125
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,306
Why were you in the water like that?
You could have died!

126
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,183
You're the one who will die.

127
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,477
Your heart's about to explode.

128
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,190
Like I said before,

129
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,108
it isn't the sound of my heart.

130
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:41,028
But I don't have a heart.

131
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:44,698
What human being doesn't have a heart?

132
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,325
Stop playing in the water.

133
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,038
You should change first.

134
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,233
You're telling the truth this time.

135
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:21,235
Your heart's about to explode.

136
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,260
You again?

137
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:48,762
Stop right now.

138
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:51,056
Come on, stop.

139
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,030
Are you going to keep doing this?

140
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,116
I told you to stay here,
yet you go into the pool?

141
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,037
I told you to stay low.
Why won't you listen?

142
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,124
Do you want to get caught?

143
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,843
Please, act like Shin.

144
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,471
Do you understand?

145
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,811
He's telling Shin to act like Shin?

146
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,523
Are there two of them?

147
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,443
So-bong.

148
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,947
Shin doesn't have a brother,
let alone a twin.

149
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:50,157
Exactly.

150
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:51,659
That's absurd.

151
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:58,582
I told you to stay low.
Why won't you listen?

152
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:00,626
Do you want to get caught?

153
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,753
How can he get caught?

154
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,130
Is he...

155
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:13,681
Hi, Ms. Jo.

156
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,766
Look into something for me.

157
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,543
You always seem to do your best
for Mr. Nam.

158
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,169
Aren't you going to drive?

159
00:16:44,878 --> 00:16:45,879
Yes, sir.

160
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,415
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

161
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,419
We're happy you've recovered, Mr. Nam.

162
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,132
-What's the big deal?
-He hasn't been here in a while.

163
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,092
It's obvious that we should greet him.

164
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,720
I guess Shin is the only one you can see.

165
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,473
Broaden your view
when your elders are here.

166
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,099
Why must I do that?

167
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,771
I've raised her wrong.
Let's go in.

168
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,032
We'll be done soon. Wait here.

169
00:17:58,368 --> 00:18:02,289
The second project, following
the presentation is the test drive.

170
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,500
The first self-driving car

171
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,669
to hit the roads in this country

172
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,589
will begin it's test drive
at 2 p.m. tomorrow.

173
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,550
A car without a driver
will be on the road.

174
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:16,553
We'll draw attention for sure.

175
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,681
There's no risk of accidents, right?

176
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,602
The fire was bigger news
than the presentation.

177
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:27,940
Luckily, thanks to Mr. Nam's heroism,
the company gained public interest.

178
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,441
Does that raise stock prices?

179
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:34,196
Do you know how big the compensation
to the victims and building owner were?

180
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,405
You can't say...

181
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:38,742
the fire was due to Mr. Nam's negligence.

182
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,080
This isn't the time to talk about blame!

183
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:48,210
How can the test drive succeed
with that attitude?

184
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,586
If we fail...

185
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:54,675
we won't be able to make the car at all!
All the money and time we invested

186
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,426
-will be wasted!
-And if we succeed?

187
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,768
I'll succeed, so give me your position.

188
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,320
We can commercialize the self-driving car
in three years.

189
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,573
The test drive is just the beginning.

190
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,408
Think of your health,

191
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:20,993
and leave it to me.

192
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,661
Hey. Are you insane?

193
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:25,664
How dare you covet my dad's position?

194
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:31,461
NATION'S FIRST SELF-DRIVING CAR
TO HIT THE ROAD

195
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,089
I'm not the same old Shin.

196
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,343
I don't want to lose what's mine anymore.

197
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,555
The chairman's extreme greed

198
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:44,683
must be in my blood as well.

199
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,939
You have some greed now?

200
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,693
That's good progress.

201
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,696
Drool over my position...

202
00:19:57,946 --> 00:19:59,990
once you've succeeded.

203
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,244
Let's end this meeting now.

204
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:19,051
It's nice to see you
overflowing with confidence.

205
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,470
I hope we see it more often.

206
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:29,186
I redecorated your office.

207
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,188
-Let's check it out together.
-No.

208
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,024
Why not? You're hurting my feelings.

209
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,901
He hasn't fully recovered yet.

210
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:38,153
He needs to go home, so maybe next time.

211
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,741
Sure. We have plenty of time.

212
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,618
You're not my man only for today.

213
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,245
Rest up, okay?

214
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:55,921
You did well.

215
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,008
I need to go to the hospital,
so go home first.

216
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,093
What if...

217
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:05,430
the human Nam Shin doesn't wake up?

218
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:10,519
Will I become PK Group's CEO?

219
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:13,146
We'll make him wake up somehow.

220
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,440
Shin is more important to me than I am.

221
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,032
Do you think I'm lying?

222
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,621
I tried to prank you, but failed.

223
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,095
MS. JO

224
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:49,016
These are screenshots of the CCTV
from the hospital.

225
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,660
I'm in the VIP ward,

226
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,537
and that doctor and Young-hoon

227
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,664
are going in and out of a VIP suite.

228
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,833
I think that woman is the guardian,

229
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,335
but I don't know who the patient is.

230
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,628
They say he needs absolute rest.
No visitors allowed.

231
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,505
They won't let anyone in.

232
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,090
Do you think...

233
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,093
it's the man that you saw?

234
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:27,596
He told him to act like Shin
and not to get caught.

235
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,348
I caught that with my hidden camera.

236
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,434
Then... the one in the house is a fake?

237
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,699
That woman just walked by.

238
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,163
Is this some fantasy movie?

239
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,208
If he doesn't have a twin,
how are there two of them?

240
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,296
I'll be by later,
so get a look at his face.

241
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,131
Remember, call me in half an hour.

242
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,076
I'll succeed, so give me your position.

243
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:34,454
I'm not the same old Shin.

244
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,334
I don't want to lose what's mine anymore.

245
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,933
So-bong sent this.

246
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,520
She said she'll call from the hospital
when she's sure.

247
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,112
There's a reason Shin brought up
the chairman's seat.

248
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,866
He discussed it with Laura and Young-hoon.

249
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,579
This woman is his brain,
and Young-hoon is his arms and legs.

250
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,209
Good.

251
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:25,338
I can get rid of all of these nuisances
all together at once.

252
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:40,645
You seem very different lately.

253
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,482
You smacked me on my head before,

254
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,068
and now, you comfort me and save my life.

255
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,946
Why did you change so much?

256
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,910
I'm just curious.

257
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,787
-You seem like a different person--
-Why?

258
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,290
-You don't think I'm Nam Shin?
-Sorry?

259
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:07,047
I was nice because I felt bad,
and this is the thanks I get.

260
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:09,925
Should I smack your head again?

261
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,177
No. No, sir.

262
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,095
Mind your own business and drive.

263
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,459
-Hello?
-You told me to call in half an hour.

264
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,585
Dad?

265
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,837
What? Hospital?

266
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,303
You're establishing your alibi?

267
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,056
I have my camera in place.

268
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,725
I'll get a photo of the inside
of the VIP suite.

269
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,103
Why are you suddenly in the hospital?

270
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,522
I'm working. I can't go right now.

271
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:23,373
I'm sorry, sir.

272
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:26,543
May I run to the hospital for a bit?

273
00:26:28,461 --> 00:26:31,923
My dad got hurt
while sparring with someone.

274
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,053
You can hold my hand
if you don't believe me.

275
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,139
You said you are a lie detector.

276
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,933
Forget it. Just go.

277
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:44,853
I'll take a cab and be right back.

278
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,229
No.

279
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,481
You can take my car. Your father's hurt.

280
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,610
Thank you, sir.

281
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,426
Hi, friend.

282
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:52,128
PK Hospital.

283
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,260
I told you over and over. Not now.

284
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,138
All the nurses are working right now.

285
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,808
Wait two hours until the floor is empty.

286
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:08,144
Nurses will be around then too.
We need to hurry.

287
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,481
Okay.

288
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,234
Let's listen to the doctor.

289
00:28:14,943 --> 00:28:16,194
They're still setting up.

290
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,364
It'll take time if we want Shin
to rest right away.

291
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,490
Where is it?

292
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,701
Is the HR Foundation helping?

293
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:26,121
I don't know.
It's no fun if I tell you too soon.

294
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,542
Shin must feel suffocated.
Let's give him some sunlight.

295
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,976
Awesome. I got it.

296
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,483
What?

297
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,242
I'm near the hospital.

298
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,250
Where's Shin? Is that Shin home?

299
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,977
You were right.

300
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,687
There really are two Nam Shins.

301
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:38,067
Mr. Ji is with him too.
What are they up to?

302
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,698
So-bong.

303
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:45,575
So-bong!

304
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,452
Hello, Mr. Seo.

305
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:50,538
I've located that woman,
but I have something bigger.

306
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:54,209
That patient I saw
does look just like Mr. Nam Shin.

307
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,627
What are you...

308
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,588
I told you, Shin has no brothers.

309
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,716
Stop wasting time on useless things,
and look into her.

310
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,426
What I saw was correct.

311
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,221
I can't explain over the phone,
so I'll meet you after I check.

312
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,814
-What will you do?
-What else?

313
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:16,981
I need to storm in.

314
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:18,942
You wait here.

315
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:34,123
NEEDS ABSOLUTE REST
NO VISITORS

316
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,556
What are you doing, So-bong?

317
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:41,232
How did you get in?

318
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,200
Hello?

319
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:55,455
The hidden camera video's frozen.

320
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,049
There's no one there. We were wrong.
Get out of there.

321
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,176
Hi, Dad.

322
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,262
My boss Mr. Nam really is here.

323
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,390
I'll be right down. Okay.

324
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,272
I came to see my dad at the hospital,

325
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,858
and a nurse said the PK heir...

326
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,652
was in the VIP suite.

327
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:29,405
I was sure you were home when I left.

328
00:32:31,074 --> 00:32:32,158
How did you get here?

329
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,160
So-bong.

330
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,080
Can we talk?

331
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,507
There was a car accident.

332
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:51,636
We thought it would be okay,
since it wasn't serious,

333
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,638
but you saw before yourself.

334
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,351
He hugs people who cry
and holds people's hands.

335
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,312
He's been doing things
that aren't like him,

336
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,314
so he has been getting treated discreetly.

337
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,985
They say it's due to the trauma
from the accident.

338
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:12,198
We didn't want the media to find out,
so we kept it a secret.

339
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:14,784
I hope you understand.

340
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,206
You know you can't get caught.

341
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,500
Please act like Shin.

342
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,800
You said it was a secret,

343
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,885
but you seem to have had a guest.

344
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:40,852
Ms. Seo. I'm sure his fiancÃ©e knows.

345
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,021
It's Mr. Nam's mother.

346
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:46,107
-Mother?
-She came in briefly from abroad...

347
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:48,860
secretly.

348
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:52,947
You'llâ¦

349
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,074
keep quiet, right?

350
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,703
That's the basics for a guard.

351
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,008
Sorry for wasting your time.

352
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,969
It's okay.

353
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,388
It was fun.

354
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:22,518
I got to use that huge camera
for the first time.

355
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,275
Did So-bong leave?

356
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:32,987
-I totally fooled her, didn't I?
-How did you know she'd come?

357
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,998
The moment she faked her excuse to leave,

358
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,417
I realized there was a hidden camera.

359
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:50,338
I found out her destination
from the car GPS,

360
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,300
so I hacked into her tablet
and found out what she was after.

361
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:58,346
You jerk, Nam Shin.
I'll uncover your true identity.

362
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,516
I froze the video
so she'd think I was in the room.

363
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,227
Moved the human Nam Shin right away.

364
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:13,820
And I arrived before So-bong.

365
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,448
Why did you make that judgment?

366
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,867
You should've called
when you found the camera.

367
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:22,537
I told you last time too.

368
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,581
-I need to know first so that--
-That's incorrect.

369
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,043
So-bong already heard our conversation
from the camera.

370
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:32,338
No. To be more exact,
she heard what you said.

371
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,883
If no one was here,
she would've been more suspicious.

372
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:38,970
She'd think you hid whoever was here.

373
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:45,309
My judgment was more appropriate today
than yours.

374
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,563
A human cannot compete
with my cognitive abilities.

375
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:52,191
If I had stayed home as you instructedâ¦

376
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,195
what do you think would've happened?

377
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,915
Let's pretend not to know
about the hidden camera, for now.

378
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:11,586
We need to find out
if she'sÂ working alone.

379
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,755
Mom should be on her way, right?

380
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:22,805
Who hired her?

381
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,183
How could I find that out?

382
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:26,976
Someone must have told her
his room number.

383
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,396
Find out from the people
who were assigned here.

384
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:31,522
Thanks.

385
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,693
Who is he asking about?

386
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:39,280
He's wondering who hired
the guard that came to the hospital.

387
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,830
Seriously.

388
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,964
I said you were wrong.
Why didn't you listen?

389
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,593
You chased the wrong person
and lost the one who mattered.

390
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,806
I heard she was Mr. Nam's mother.

391
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,976
He must have been anxious.

392
00:37:09,268 --> 00:37:11,479
Young-hoon even told you that much.

393
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,148
He said she was worried about her son,

394
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,610
who was being treated secretly
due to an accident while he was abroad.

395
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:22,406
He really was in an accident abroad?

396
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,451
So-bong.

397
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,914
-You installed a hidden camera, right?
-Yes.

398
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:34,001
Use that to figure out
exactly what is wrong with Mr. Nam.

399
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:37,296
Call me if you get any solid proof.

400
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,422
Proof?

401
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,093
Yes, sir.

402
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,650
Thank you for getting everything
ready so quickly.

403
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,610
Use this opportunity to think it over.

404
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,821
I'm impressive no matter where I am
in the world.

405
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:07,076
He surprised me today.

406
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:11,497
He made a judgment like a person
and avoided being caught.

407
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,915
He was better than a person.

408
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,625
He's our son after all.

409
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,547
We need to watch closely
to see how he'll develop.

410
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,843
I saw him in person,
but I still can't believe it.

411
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:25,720
A robot that's growing.

412
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:31,058
It's him.

413
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:34,562
-Hello?
-I did well today, right, Mom?

414
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:35,730
Of course.

415
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:38,733
We got out safely thanks to your help.

416
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,569
-Thanks.
-Then let's go home now.

417
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,323
-What?
-The human Nam Shin is back,

418
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,782
so we should go back home.

419
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:54,165
Shin is still in a critical condition.

420
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,043
I need to stay with him.

421
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,630
I'm Shin too, Mom.

422
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:06,010
Yes, Shin. Let's go home soon.

423
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,012
Let's talk again soon.

424
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:10,931
My son! I miss you! Come visit! Son!

425
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,743
It's okay. Mom said we can go home soon.

426
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:42,004
But exactly how long is "soon"...

427
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,509
to humans?

428
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:56,268
DAD

429
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,084
What is this?

430
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,170
DAD

431
00:40:27,341 --> 00:40:29,218
Why did you send me this?

432
00:40:29,468 --> 00:40:32,138
Are you saying you consider
your only daughter dead?

433
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,224
I'm sorry, but I have no daughter.

434
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,268
Then why did you send a photo
of a memorial?

435
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,353
Mom's memorial isn't--

436
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,442
Dad.

437
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,069
Took you long enough.

438
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:51,490
I can't believe you forgot
your mom's memorial.

439
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:54,285
You should've called or texted!

440
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:56,454
I didn't becauseÂ I was so angry at you!
So?

441
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,415
You ignored my call just a minute ago too.

442
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:04,295
Keep that up and you're neither
Mom's daughter nor mine.

443
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,755
You bratty little girl.

444
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,387
What are you doing?

445
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,139
You startled me.

446
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,474
Is something down there?

447
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:00,559
My necklace.

448
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:04,104
When I jumped in like an idiot
to save you unnecessarily,

449
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:05,606
I dropped it.

450
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:08,484
It's the one thing my mom left me.

451
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,283
Your mom?

452
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,035
Yes.

453
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:23,457
What are you doing?

454
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:24,833
Hold on.

455
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,583
What was that?

456
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:08,752
Why did you cover my eyes?

457
00:43:22,224 --> 00:43:23,434
Don't lose it again.

458
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:25,686
Your mom would be sad.

459
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:32,985
I'm sorry.

460
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:41,327
Don't ask what I'm sorry for.

461
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,204
I'm just sorry.

462
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:50,252
I can tell without holding your hand.
You're telling the truth.

463
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:54,131
Thank you for telling me the truth.

464
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:18,906
I can tell without holding your hand

465
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,449
you're telling the truth.

466
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:23,369
Thank you for telling me the truth.

467
00:44:49,269 --> 00:44:50,479
MACH

468
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,940
PK MOTORS

469
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:58,445
-Is it going well?
-Yes.

470
00:44:58,737 --> 00:44:59,988
-Want some coffee?
-Sure.

471
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:15,754
Mr. Seo?

472
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:19,800
Hello.

473
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:22,636
You're so young.
You must be very skilled.

474
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:26,140
He can hack into the self-driving car
and control it however he wants.

475
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,643
His talent is wasted in the black market.

476
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,521
You know,

477
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:38,777
I want to show how dangerous machines,
like self-driving cars, are to humans.

478
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:40,821
Sadly,

479
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,241
many must get hurt and die
for people to realize that.

480
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:47,911
-I understand.
-It would be good

481
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:50,289
if one of the victims of the accident

482
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,667
experiences horror
due to the self-driving car.

483
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:56,336
Horror...

484
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,874
PK GROUP

485
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:53,477
There are many reporters
and interested parties here.

486
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,062
I feel good about this.

487
00:46:55,479 --> 00:46:58,106
I think the self-driving car
will soon become

488
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,067
our core business.

489
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:04,238
Please clear up the personal matters
before Mr. Nam gets busier, Mr. Chairman.

490
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,073
What do you mean?

491
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,116
Please let Mr. Nam and I...

492
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:09,993
get married.

493
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:15,457
Both publicly and privately,
we'll bring PK a new future.

494
00:47:16,667 --> 00:47:20,003
That's a novel way ofÂ throwing yourself
at a guy.

495
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:30,639
We'll begin an hour from now.

496
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:33,225
Mr. Nam will ride in the car,

497
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:35,769
and everyone else
can watch it live from here.

498
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,813
Mr. Nam, shall we go?

499
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,837
Wait. Mr. Nam?

500
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,424
I'll stay here with the chairman.
I'll see you later.

501
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,182
Okay. Talk.

502
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:15,934
A nurse from the ward said

503
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:19,021
a reporter kept asking about the patient
in the VIP suite.

504
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:20,314
A reporter?

505
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:31,700
What are you doing?

506
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,076
Hold on.

507
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,496
Don't lose it again.

508
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:38,832
Your mom will be sad.

509
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:56,391
Can the AI in the car malfunction?

510
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:58,352
I'm Ko Chang Jo
of the self-driving car team.

511
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:01,313
Don't worry.
If you hit the kill switch in the car,

512
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,857
you can drive the car manually.

513
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,734
-Any other questions?
-What about...

514
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:08,445
All you have to do is ride in the car
and look cool.

515
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:10,322
It may seem late,

516
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:13,241
but we've spent a long time developing...

517
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:14,451
Where's the M-Car?

518
00:49:14,701 --> 00:49:16,870
-It's standing by there.
-Next question?

519
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,878
Gosh, it really wasn't me.

520
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:10,465
Why would I go to the hospital VIP suite?

521
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:14,094
You're close with So-bong.
Should we go to the hospital and check?

522
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,099
I did go, but--

523
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:22,060
Did So-bong ask you,
or is there someone else?

524
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:24,980
If no one hired her,
So-bong's life is over.

525
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:28,150
-What?
-If she was digging into this on her own,

526
00:50:28,233 --> 00:50:29,651
she'll pay the consequences.

527
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:33,113
This time, it'll be more
than not being able to get another job.

528
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,156
Someone hired her.

529
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,788
Three, two, one. Cue.

530
00:50:43,832 --> 00:50:46,710

531
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:21,161
He would've been happy
to know you were here.

532
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,247
I want to see how he reacts
under pressure with so many variables.

533
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,629
Mr. Seo hired So-bong.

534
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:33,590
I'll tell the chairman soon,
so don't talk with her.

535
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,343
Okay. Don't worry.

536
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,168
This is going to be groundbreaking.
Congratulations, sir.

537
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:30,397
CONNECTION PASS

538
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:55,964
Mr. Nam.

539
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:58,842
I'll quit after today.

540
00:52:58,925 --> 00:53:00,385
Something personal came up.

541
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:02,596
I'm sorry for being irresponsible.

542
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,768
I'll find you someone better
if you're in need.

543
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,063
I'm really sorry.

544
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,900
Why? You saw everything,
so you're not curious anymore?

545
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,068
Pardon? Saw what?

546
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:18,612
The hidden camera.

547
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,032
You thought I didn't know?

548
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,954
Why is that car suddenly speeding up?

549
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,339
Why is this speeding up?

550
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,174
Did you increase the speed, Ms. Yeo?

551
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,593
It wasn't us. I think it's a system error.

552
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,471
Where is it? Where is the problem?

553
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:51,770
Something's wrong.

554
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,189
I think there's a problem.

555
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,400
Mr. Chairman.

556
00:54:00,904 --> 00:54:02,572
I need to tell you something in private.

557
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:06,785
-Is there a problem?
-What's going on?

558
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:07,827
It's gone crazy.

559
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,997
-What's going on?
-What's wrong with it?

560
00:54:11,289 --> 00:54:13,667
-Is something wrong?
-What is happening?

561
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,009
Wait! What...

562
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,146
Mr. Nam. What's wrong with that car?

563
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,411
-Ji-yong, are you okay?
-It's rejecting me.

564
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:51,538
We've been hacked. Be careful.

565
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:56,501
I'll try to do something.

566
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:27,449
DOOR OPEN... SUCCESS

567
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,466
Ji-yong!

568
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,596
What's wrong with that car?

569
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,514
Take pictures.

570
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,309
Okay. Hey.

571
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:55,977
Mr. Ji.

572
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,363
Do as you wish
if you want Shin to be found out.

573
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,462
Mr. Nam. Stop staring into space.

574
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:23,880
Do something!

575
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,925
Do something already!

576
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,309
CONNECTION FAIL

577
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,604
What's going on?

578
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,731
Some punk is trying to get in.

579
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:45,276
I need to block anyone from getting in
and increase the speed.

580
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:55,120
ACCELERATOR
BRAKE SYSTEM

581
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:58,248
ACCESS DENIED
BRAKE SYSTEM

582
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:32,198
I need to get in there
to hit the kill switch.

583
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:33,741
Get as close as possible.

584
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:35,743
How can you get into a moving car?

585
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,121
Gosh, seriously?

586
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:48,548
What are you doing? You'll go up there?

587
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:51,217
Have you lost your mind?
Aren't you scared?

588
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:54,345
I don't know that stuff.
I have no emotions.

589
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:58,516
Mr. Nam.

590
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,602
Mr. Nam!

591
00:59:03,373 --> 00:59:04,457
Mr. Nam!

592
00:59:32,652 --> 00:59:33,778
No!

593
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,314
Mr. Nam, are you okay?

594
01:00:09,897 --> 01:00:11,691
Your face! You're hurt!

595
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:14,444
Are you hurt anywhere else?
Are you okay? Oh, no.

596
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:11,751
He wasn't human.

597
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,671
We'll pay as much as you want,
just don't tell Mr. Seo.

598
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:17,006
You're all insane.
What if I tell everyone?

599
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,633
A person's life is at stake.

600
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,135
Shin can't work on the self-driving car.

601
01:01:21,386 --> 01:01:22,887
Make sure he doesn't.

602
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,181
You just focus onÂ your wedding planning,
Shin.

603
01:01:25,264 --> 01:01:27,642
-This isn't a marriage. You're begging!
-I only need Shin.

604
01:01:29,185 --> 01:01:30,603
I can't do this.

605
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,773
You can't go. Please help me.

606
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,693
Please stop acting like
a person in front of me.

607
