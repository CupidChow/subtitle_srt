[The Journey of Legend]

2
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,920
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,280
Actually, I'm doing all this

4
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,140
only to become
the grandmaster of Huanhua Sect.

5
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,479
Grandmaster?

6
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,530
Big Brother,
you're not joking with us, are you?

7
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,120
Since when do you want that position?

8
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,030
You've never talked about it.

9
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,690
Everyone should have a dream.

10
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,240
Well, if a member
of the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood

11
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,560
is the grandmaster of a sect,

12
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,410
won't it sound amazing?

13
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,760
Won't it be impressive?

14
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,870
Big Brother, so you're serious?

15
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,280
But...

16
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,870
Mr. Xiao is determined

17
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:33,190
to make your brother the next grandmaster.

18
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:34,960
Besides, the succession ceremony

19
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,890
of Huanhua Sect will be held
in just a few days, right?

20
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,910
T-That's why we need to
pool our wisdom now.

21
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:43,960
Guys,

22
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,360
use your wit
to analyze the situation for me.

23
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,150
W-What

24
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,560
can I do to change my father's mind?

25
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,030
The key to becoming the young sect leader

26
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:55,870
is to have a good reputation
in the martial world.

27
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,850
Your brother is highly reputed
in Jinzhong now.

28
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,470
We've done many good deeds in anonymity

29
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:04,630
over these years.

30
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,710
Your brother is indeed much more respected

31
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,260
than you are in the martial world.

32
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,960
So it's about fame.

33
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,050
That's easy.
Let's start with a publicity campaign.

34
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,160
Publicity campaign?

35
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,730
What do you mean?

36
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,280
I'm saying

37
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,470
that we can create a buzz.

38
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,190
Let me explain it.

39
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:36,040
For example,

40
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:39,520
we can come up with
novel and awe-inspiring

41
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,560
nicknames and promote them around,

42
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,990
so that I'll be known to the martial world
before making an appearance.

43
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:47,360
Without further ado, guys,

44
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,310
write down the names

45
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,820
of all the influential
and prominent figures

46
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,030
in the martial world now.

47
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,070
I'll challenge them.

48
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,280
Write down their names?

49
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,430
All of them?

50
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,310
A-Are you sure?

51
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,630
Of course I am.

52
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:04,590
Come up here. Hurry.

53
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,280
D-Don't catch a cold.

54
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,630
Come on, Qiu, Yuhan.

55
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,840
Seriously?

56
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
These many?

57
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,040
"Duckie Don"?

58
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,190
That's brilliant.

59
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:26,930
He's very famous.

60
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,800
This has been the trend
in the martial world for years.

61
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,830
Names like "Heavenly Knight,"
"Nether Lord," "King of Fame,"

62
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:36,000
and "Super Swordsman" are commonly seen.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,720
Some even

64
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,800
name themselves "Sweetheart"

65
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,000
and "Duckie," or simply by numbers.

66
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,800
Given that,
I'm afraid it's hard to impress others

67
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,750
with novel names.

68
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,000
We can't rise to fame quickly

69
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,750
unless we kill many of those
from the Power Gang.

70
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,680
But Big Brother,

71
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,570
didn't you say
we must conserve our strength?

72
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,600
Now this is tricky.

73
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:00,360
Actually, there's a second option.

74
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:01,830
What is it?

75
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,360
"Behold the divine token of mystery."

76
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,220
“All heroes shall bow immediately.”

77
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,270
What nonsense is that now?

78
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:11,930
It's not nonsense,

79
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,190
but the precious asset
of the martial world.

80
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,310
You mean the Hero Command Token?

81
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:17,270
Yes.

82
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,070
The Hero Command Token

83
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,800
was made of meteorites by the grandmasters

84
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,950
of Emei Sect, Wudang Sect

85
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:25,950
and Shaolin Sect.

86
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:29,390
Rumor has it that Crazy Yan hid
the long lost gem of the martial world,

87
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,650
the Voidheart Codex, in this very token.

88
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,260
Big Brother, if you get it,

89
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,040
you'll shoot to fame in the martial world.

90
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,190
The token is in the hands of
Old Madam Wu now,

91
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:39,720
whose son General Wu Jie
is guarding the Immortal Pass.

92
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:40,680
Everybody in the martial world

93
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,830
is looking for Old Madam Wu at the moment.

94
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,240
How are we supposed to find

95
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,370
the Voidheart Codex

96
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,920
within the Hero Command Token?

97
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,360
It's the Voidheart Codex again.

98
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,830
I can't get the secret manual

99
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,830
ahead of schedule
without becoming the grandmaster.

100
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,970
But without the secret manual,

101
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,610
I can't become the grandmaster, can I?

102
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:08,950
What a vicious circle.

103
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,430
Why doesn't the book just let me die?

104
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,720
What are you mumbling about?

105
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,270
This matter is not urgent. Why the rush?

106
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,430
Let's go have fun.

107
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,160
Where to?

108
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,000
Come with me.

109
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,560
H-Hold it, Tang Rou.

110
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,480
Have you quit looking for Feng Lang?

111
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,280
That can wait!

112
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,190
What should be our next move exactly?

113
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,190
Just come with me.

114
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,330
Here it is. We've arrived.

115
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,750
Look, what a beautiful dance.

116
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,480
How lovely.

117
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,159
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

118
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,750
This way, please.

119
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,360
Okay.

120
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,560
So beautiful.

121
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,430
Bravo! Bravo!

122
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,670
Well done!

123
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,070
Do you like it?

124
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,330
I'm glad Your Highness is satisfied.

125
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,480
This dance is newly choreographed.

126
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,630
Go, Big Brother.

127
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,800
Terrific.

128
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,180
I'm thinking about the same thing as you.

129
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:46,000
Big Brother, what do you think?

130
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:48,600
This is Qunfang House,
also known as a miniature of Qinhuai area.

131
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,600
It's visited by numerous scholars
and martial practitioners.

132
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,400
The scene setting does recreate

133
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,320
the description in the book.

134
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,830
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

135
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,890
Big Brother.

136
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,480
Big Brother?

137
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,290
Big Brother!

138
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,600
You seem a bit nervous. How come?

139
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,680
I think we should...

140
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,360
Aren't you Mr. Zuo? Long time no see.

141
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:30,000
Greetings, gentlemen.

142
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,950
Ma'am, lead us to a quiet place.

143
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,480
Sure. Come on.

144
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,390
Come right in.

145
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,860
Let's go, Big Brother.

146
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,390
This way, please.

147
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,390
Hongye, Qingliu!

148
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:42,789
Yes!

149
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,150
Such powerful toxins.

150
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,560
I can't believe
I'm not able to force them out.

151
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,250
Even if I'm too weak to make a move,

152
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,840
whoever tries to approach me
will have to die.

153
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,750
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

154
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,720
Sir, a pot of good wine for that room.

155
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,210
Sure. Just a second.

156
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:26,840
Make way! Let us through!

157
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,720
Who are you, Sir?

158
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,030
What brings you here?

159
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:32,600
Someone killed a fellow of ours
and is hiding here.

160
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,660
Stay out of our way!

161
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:34,650
The Power Gang?

162
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,210
Search!

163
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,220
The Power Gang?

164
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,080
Have they figured out

165
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,000
that I killed Fu Tianyi?

166
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,960
Search carefully, guys!

167
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,010
Go, step aside!

168
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,480
Search!

169
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,150
Make way!

170
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:52,030
Make way! Out of my way!

171
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:54,720
You can't just barge in, gentlemen.

172
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,270
Move!

173
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:57,200
Make way!

174
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,790
Search carefully!

175
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,270
Search!

176
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,310
They took action so fast.

177
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,470
Open the door!

178
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:17,000
You, go break it!

179
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:18,670
I'm sorry, buddy.

180
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:22,480
I'll just hide in here for a moment.

181
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,390
He's in there. Go!

182
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,510
Feng Lang?

183
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,720
He's my lucky bag, Feng Lang the NPC.

184
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,320
Stop!

185
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,270
Who are you?
How dare you stand in our way?

186
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:49,240
When I see an injustice,
I'll stand up against it!

187
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,760
Take him down!

188
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,680
Catch the sword!

189
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,870
My muscle memory has completely awakened.

190
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,870
I'm more skilled in martial arts now
than I was when fighting Fu Tianyi.

191
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,910
It is nice to have run into Feng Lang.

192
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,000
Big Brother!

193
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,290
Are you alright?

194
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,690
Big Brother,

195
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:59,120
why did you
beat them all down alone so soon?

196
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,380
Are you trying to gain a good reputation?

197
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,550
I got it.

198
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,340
Everyone, take a look!

199
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:09,750
The third young master of Huanhua Sect
Xiao Qiushui has done a good deed.

200
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,360
Spread the news around, please!

201
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,240
Spread it!

202
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,440
So that's Xiao Qiushui?

203
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,370
How impressive.

204
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,380
Now I know it's him.

205
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,750
Yeah.

206
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,710
What an extraordinary fighter.

207
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,390
Xiao Qiushui...

208
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,550
Huanhua Sect...

209
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:25,720
Shut up.

210
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:30,390
Lad, do you know who you just saved?

211
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:34,680
He killed that man so quickly

212
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,540
that I couldn't catch a good look!

213
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,530
Who did you save?

214
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:45,890
A friend of mine, named Feng Lang.

215
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,900
It's exactly the jade pendant

216
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,800
I wrote about.

217
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,260
With each shake
comes a sound of pattering rain.

218
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,150
The Rain Sword.

219
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,030
Correct.

220
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,030
It's him.

221
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,760
The scar is in the same place as I wrote.

222
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,150
The location and the keepsake
match the description.

223
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,550
He must be the guy.

224
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,680
[Bamboo]

225
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,510
Oh, you woke up. Don't move.

226
00:17:03,670 --> 00:17:04,750
Just stay in bed.

227
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:05,680
You're injured.

228
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,750
Who are you?

229
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,750
Answer my question first.

230
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:22,160
Does this jade pendant belong to you?

231
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:23,440
Yes.

232
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:28,030
I am Feng Lang,
the owner of the Rain Sword.

233
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,640
It really is you.

234
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:52,720
This stupid system
has finally done something right.

235
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:56,510
Finally, my buddy.

236
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,310
My dearest friend.

237
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:01,310
Sir, Sir...

238
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,160
I'm terribly sorry.

239
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,490
I got a bit carried away.

240
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,960
Have we met before?

241
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,260
Now is not too late to get acquainted.

242
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,810
Let me pour you some water.

243
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,090
I have a few questions.

244
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
Who taught you sword skills?
At what age did you start the training?

245
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,900
What do you like to do best?

246
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,550
Come on, have some water.

247
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:36,280
I don't know.

248
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:40,400
Y-You don't know?

249
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,350
H-Has your head been injured?

250
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,030
Are you fishing for

251
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,000
information from me?

252
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:58,530
This lucky bag has been forcibly activated
by my presence.

253
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,920
Maybe he just hasn't settled in.

254
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,930
Lucky Bag,
I know you have excellent martial skills.

255
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,040
But don't worry.

256
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:10,400
Your secret is safe with me.

257
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,510
You keep calling me "Lucky Bag."
What does it mean?

258
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,920
How should I put it?

259
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,590
I can't explain it to you right now.

260
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:25,480
Anyway,

261
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,960
you'll eliminate my enemies,
bring me precious items,

262
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,200
strategize for me,

263
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:35,650
and most importantly,
help me become the grandmaster.

264
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:37,000
What now?

265
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,970
At the first sight of me,

266
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:40,720
didn't you feel an urge to protect me?

267
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,480
You want to be

268
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,830
my ride-or-die
and do anything for me, right?

269
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:44,490
Not really.

270
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,730
Not really?

271
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,290
When I first saw you,

272
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,880
I didn't think you'd live long.

273
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,240
This is odd.

274
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,270
The Feng Lang I wrote

275
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,790
would not only look for
the Infinite Pill for me,

276
00:19:57,790 --> 00:20:00,200
but also transfer
all his martial power to me.

277
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,720
Why is this character different now?

278
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,310
You don't consider me as a friend now,
do you?

279
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,240
Should I consider you as a friend?

280
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,300
I'm not his friend?

281
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,270
Has the lucky bag
not been activated yet?

282
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:23,590
It's fine.
Though you don't see me as a friend now,

283
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:25,850
soon you'll understand what I'm saying.

284
00:20:26,270 --> 00:20:29,590
Now, the focus should be
fixing your injuries.

285
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,270
Water is there. Help yourself with it.

286
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,600
I'll go get you a doctor.

287
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,440
Feng Lang...

288
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,270
Xiao Qiushui...

289
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,720
Mr. Feng's external injuries
are not severe.

290
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,790
But he seems to have been inflicted by

291
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,400
the Noxious Beetles.

292
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:03,690
The Noxious Beetles?
Then it's a non-toxic poison.

293
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,420
The only cure is also a non-toxic poison.

294
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:09,510
I can't believe
the Power Gang would be so cruel to him.

295
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,060
Xueyu is a miraculous doctor.

296
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:15,790
Why don't you bring Feng Lang
back to Huanhua Sect for medical help?

297
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:18,190
The poison in him will kick in
within 3 days.

298
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:20,160
There's no time for that.

299
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,200
Within 3 days?

300
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,720
Then, what can we do?

301
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:28,070
Big Brother, I know a place—

302
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,000
the Wonder Liquor Villa.

303
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,200
The owner there is known for
making miracle-working liquor.

304
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,000
A kind of it is called "Nether Dew,"

305
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,550
which intoxicates the drinkers right away.

306
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:36,930
It can be counted as a non-toxic poison.

307
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:37,930
Sounds feasible.

308
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,070
It only takes half a day to travel to

309
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:41,750
the Wonder Liquor Villa from here.

310
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:45,510
Alright. Let's set off now.

311
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,240
-Let's go.
-Wait, Big Brother.

312
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,440
Who exactly is Feng Lang?

313
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:52,410
First, you saved him.
Now, you're trying to cure him.

314
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,160
It's our duty

315
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,790
to help those in need.

316
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,110
Big Brother, something's off with you.

317
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:07,440
Yuhan,

318
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,370
I can't explain everything to you now.

319
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,610
I need more helpers,

320
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:14,880
given the turmoil
in the martial world now.

321
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:18,160
Alright. No more talking. Let's go.

322
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,720
Mr. Feng, hang in there.

323
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,300
We'll arrive soon.

324
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,460
We barely know each other.

325
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:46,200
Why are you so nice to me?

326
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,400
How should I explain it?

327
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,440
The truth might confuse you.

328
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,320
At present, the priority

329
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,000
is to kindle our friendship.

330
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,590
Is making friends with me that important?

331
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,430
How should I put it, Mr. Feng?

332
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,960
Is it difficult to keep alive
in the martial world?

333
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,440
Yes, not easy at all.

334
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,070
Right?

335
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,530
When I first came here,

336
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,050
I had a really hard time.

337
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:41,350
I'm seriously terrified when I think of

338
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,030
the future obstacles.

339
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,640
Alright. Let's put that behind.

340
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:58,080
Only when we become friends

341
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,910
in support of each other,

342
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:02,830
will we be able to go a bit further

343
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:05,040
in this hateful martial world.

344
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,110
I see.

345
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,440
If you help me get rid of
the poison in me,

346
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,000
I'll be your friend.

347
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,040
Why's that forced smile?

348
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,750
Come on. A fist bump.

349
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,720
What is it for?

350
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,600
Just to seal the deal.

351
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,140
Never mind.

352
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,830
Qiu, be quick! Guys, you're all doing

353
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,600
a good job!

354
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,500
We're almost there, Big Brother.

355
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,890
So many people want the Nether Dew.

356
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,030
Is it really that magical?

357
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:04,960
It is poison

358
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:06,590
if it is consumed directly.

359
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:08,160
But when it is mixed with spring water,

360
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,160
it'd taste like nectar.

361
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,890
It is indeed world-class wine.

362
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:12,440
Zuoqiu.

363
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,640
Tang Rou,

364
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,720
take Mr. Feng to an inn,

365
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,330
so he can get some rest.

366
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,940
Yuhan, Chaoran, let's go.

367
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,340
Time to solve a challenge.

368
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:38,940
[Wonder Liquor Villa]

369
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,590
Here they come!

370
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,590
Look! Look at my vase!

371
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,920
It's a family heirloom.

372
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,510
Please let me through.

373
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:48,570
Sell the wine to me. I'll pay you gold!

374
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:52,110
Everybody, listen to me.

375
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,110
There is only one jar of Nether Dew.

376
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,590
-Here's what our master said.
-Only one jar?

377
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:59,320
He who offers
a rare and precious item can have it.

378
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,510
Gold and houses are not exactly
rare and precious.

379
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,130
I have what he wants.

380
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:22,980
Who is this girl?

381
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,160
What kind of treasure is that?

382
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,110
Yeah.

383
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,720
What is she holding?

384
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,680
When Sheye Kingdom collapsed
a century ago,

385
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,000
the legendary Sheye Blood Wine

386
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,110
disappeared as well.

387
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,000
However, previously,

388
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:56,000
someone discovered a pot of it.

389
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,680
Sheye Blood Wine
is truly a miraculous brew.

390
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,640
Go ask your master if he wants it.

391
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:07,110
He'd love to have it!

392
00:27:08,070 --> 00:27:10,650
Miss, rare liquor is my master's favorite.

393
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:11,480
Big Brother.

394
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,200
Miss, come on in.

395
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,510
H-Hold on!

396
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,640
I brought rare liquor here too.

397
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,400
He has it too?

398
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,960
What kind of liquor is it then, Mister?

399
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,960
An unprecedented kind.

400
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,350
In that case,

401
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,750
how did you get it?

402
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:38,790
It's my own creation.

403
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,510
Your own creation?

404
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,070
Of course nobody would have tasted it.

405
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:49,800
How is it deserved
to be called "unprecedented"?

406
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,650
I wouldn't have brought it here

407
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,740
to humiliate myself
if it wasn't special at all, right?

408
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,590
Sir, my liquor is truly rare.

409
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,510
Have a glimpse of it,

410
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,920
and you'll know I'm telling the truth.

411
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:06,550
Then please take it out and show it

412
00:28:06,550 --> 00:28:07,550
to me now.

413
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,050
The making of it won't be finished
until half a day later.

414
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,750
It's not done yet?

415
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:17,680
Sir, this man is obviously lying.

416
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,920
Do not waste time on him.

417
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,400
Just give me the Nether Dew.

418
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,330
Half a day later,

419
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,000
if my liquor proves to be ordinary,

420
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,590
then I won't compete for the Nether Dew.

421
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,750
But if my liquor is found to be unique,
Sir,

422
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,240
I'm afraid your master will regret
not having it for the rest of his life.

423
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,720
Alright. Take your time to mull it over.

424
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,640
Guys, let's go.

425
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,720
Hold on! Mister, please stay.

426
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,440
Let's wait for half a day.

427
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,590
Then, I'll ask my master

428
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:50,880
to taste both kinds of
allegedly special liquor.

429
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,030
He will decide

430
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,240
who can have the Nether Dew.

431
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:04,790
Thank you.

432
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:12,110
Big Brother,
when did you learn to make liquor?

433
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:13,970
Yuhan... No. You're Chaoran.

434
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,640
The clock is ticking. We all have tasks.

435
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,690
I'll go buy some liquor now.

436
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,440
You two will go get me some

437
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,240
slim bamboo tubes,
porcelain bottles and mint leaves.

438
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,880
Oh, right.

439
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:26,030
Buy sugar and salt as well.

440
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:29,160
Bamboo tubes, mint leaves, sugar...

441
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,000
Wait, Big Brother,

442
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,350
are you sure
you can fix a drink with those?

443
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,160
Go do it now.

444
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:35,270
No more dawdling.

445
00:29:37,790 --> 00:29:39,650
Excuse me. Where can I buy liquor?

446
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,410
Over there.

447
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:41,830
Thank you.

448
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:53,200
It's been half a day.

449
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,510
I think that man is just a fraud.

450
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,770
He told a lie,
and now he has chickened out.

451
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:01,080
No need to wait for him anymore.

452
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,830
In that case, please come with me.

453
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:06,480
Wait!

454
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,110
Master, the guests have arrived.

455
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:33,750
Let them in.

456
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:34,590
Yes.

457
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,510
Please come in!

458
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,610
Greetings, Sir.

459
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,000
Greetings, Sir.

460
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,740
[Master of Wonder Liquor Villa]

461
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,080
You both brought liquor?

462
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,240
-Sir.
-S...

463
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,730
I have a pot of Sheye blood wine.

464
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,200
Master.

465
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,400
Good. No wonder it's a legend.

466
00:32:02,270 --> 00:32:04,680
It's mellow with a lingering aftertaste.

467
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,200
So exotic.

468
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,060
Mister, care to present your liquor?

469
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,550
Sir, there is a whole process

470
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:21,350
to go through before you taste

471
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:22,550
my liquor.

472
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,240
Sir.

473
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:53,680
Master.

474
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,640
Master.

475
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,670
What's the name of this?

476
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:33,440
People are bothered by many a thing.
A sip of it will take all worries away.

477
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,230
This

478
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,800
is called "Mogito."

479
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,280
I got drunk in the mansion.

480
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,000
I dreamed about a beauty
beyond description.

481
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,590
When I sobered up with inspiration,

482
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,510
gone with my worries was desperation.

483
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,710
Mogito... How brilliant!

484
00:35:35,030 --> 00:35:35,590
Master,

485
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,090
doest it taste good?

486
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:39,670
In terms of taste,

487
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,750
it's like any other spirits.

488
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:47,760
But the sweet citrus juice

489
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:50,070
complements the spirits

490
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:52,220
and adds a twist to the mouthfeel.

491
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:58,360
In particular,
the final touch of salt and mint

492
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,110
is an extremely bold choice!

493
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,510
Such a delicious drink

494
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,000
has gone beyond my wildest imagination!

495
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,590
Good. It's amazing!

496
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:16,480
Hold on!

497
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,630
This man has clearly resorted to

498
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:19,630
a trick of deceit.

499
00:36:21,070 --> 00:36:22,070
Liquor is liquor.

500
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,150
With the miscellaneous ingredients
you put in it,

501
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:27,480
is it even liquor or not?

502
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,820
The taste of liquor matters most.

503
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,710
Why bother where the taste is from?

504
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,560
Don't you think so, Sir?

505
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,260
You're right, Mister.

506
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,280
Grandpa! Grandpa!

507
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,510
Grandpa! Grandpa!

508
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,140
We want to drink it too!

509
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,070
Children can't drink alcohol.

510
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:47,130
I'm in a pickle now.

511
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,360
Mister, any idea?

512
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,150
Kids,

513
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,600
not everyone can drink alcohol.

514
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,400
Come here.

515
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:01,070
Go.

516
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,670
Let me fix you a different drink.

517
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:27,850
Alright.

518
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,590
Now, try it.

519
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,480
Take a sip.

520
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,320
Is it good?

521
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,920
-Yes.
-So tasty.

522
00:37:42,710 --> 00:37:44,030
Grandpa, what is it?

523
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,150
Grandpa, it's tasty!

524
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,000
If you like it,

525
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,240
drink some more. Go!

526
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,070
Yes!

527
00:37:50,190 --> 00:37:50,710
Careful.

528
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,800
Mister, what is that?

529
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,880
B-Boba milk tea.

530
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:04,410
Devious means.

531
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:08,360
Miss, your wine worked up my appetite.

532
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:12,590
But this young man's drink
gave me inspiration.

533
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:15,440
I thought I had reached the ultimate level

534
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,670
of making liquor,

535
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,250
and there wouldn't be more progress.

536
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,360
That made me feel aimless.

537
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,880
Now, I've finally

538
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,280
realized there are territories

539
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,800
in the world of liquor
that I haven't charted.

540
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,590
There is so much I need to work on.

541
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,670
Mister, may I have your name?

542
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,550
I'm Xiao Qiushui from Huanhua Sect.

543
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:44,190
What an admirable young man.
I appreciate what you've done.

544
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:45,230
Butler!

545
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:46,690
Yes, Master.

546
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:49,760
Return the Sheye Blood Wine
to this young lady

547
00:38:50,150 --> 00:38:52,350
and give her a thousand taels of silver.

548
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:53,190
Yes.

549
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,190
The Nether Dew is yours now, Mr. Xiao.

550
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,360
T-Thank you.

551
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,460
Who would've known

552
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:12,070
your Mogito could work?

553
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,960
I thought we'd be kicked out.

554
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:14,960
Big Brother,

555
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:17,480
no wonder you asked for
different types of bottles.

556
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,510
They were used to distill liquids
and concentrate alcohol.

557
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:21,230
Too bad

558
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,160
that I didn't get a sip of Mogito.

559
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:24,030
You like that?

560
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,040
I'll make some for you later.

561
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,440
I finally got this stuff.

562
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,710
Foul mouth, plus a veiled face.

563
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,630
People with those features
are usually awful.

564
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:47,550
Trying to rob me after you lost
—are you a bandit?

565
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,740
Give me the Nether Dew.

566
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,320
What? Are you going to snatch it from us

567
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,500
in plain daylight?

568
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,190
Yes.

569
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,110
Watch out!

570
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:06,030
-Big Brother! Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

571
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:06,590
I'm fine.

572
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,880
She has hidden weapons. Be careful.

573
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:10,590
Fang!

574
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:12,880
Fang!

575
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:15,810
What are you doing here?

576
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,300
What about you?

577
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,360
"Fang"?

578
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,340
-"Fang"?
-I'm having a tour with my friends.

579
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:24,140
Fang, this is Xiao Qiushui. Come with me.

580
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,000
So the man you've been hanging out with

581
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,200
is him—Xiao Qiushui?

582
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,190
Fang, Qiushui treats me well.

583
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:36,320
Qiushui!
This is my older sister Tang Fang.

584
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,280
[Tang Fang, from Tang Sect]

585
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,400
Tang Rou,
you've fallen in with a bad crowd.

586
00:40:51,730 --> 00:40:54,480
Fang, what do you want the Nether Dew for?

587
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,130
Out of my way.

588
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,630
Fang, Qiushui is a friend of mine.

589
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,830
Please don't be rude.

590
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:04,510
Tang Rou!

591
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,500
I won't leave you in a dilemma.

592
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,220
Here is the Nether Dew.

593
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,810
Miss, you have to snatch it, right?

594
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:17,360
Give it to me.

595
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,210
If I drop it, neither of us can have it.

596
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:22,800
You...

597
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:23,670
Fang,

598
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:25,630
Qiushui needs the Nether Dew

599
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,590
to save a friend's life.

600
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:28,510
I don't know

601
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,920
what you want it for,

602
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,110
but I'm sure

603
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,530
a human life matters most. Right?

604
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,110
The Iron Army

605
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,960
asks for the Nether Dew as a gift.

606
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:44,920
It is for opening the Omniscience Door.

607
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,710
Isn't it more important than a human life?

608
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,000
Tang Rou,

609
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,900
what is she talking about?

610
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:03,320
When the Iron Army takes action,
there has to be a result.
