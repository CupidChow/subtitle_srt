1
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,479
Yiren!

2
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:52,759
The Tribulation Finger
on each of you has been detoxified.

3
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,120
Those who choose not to believe us

4
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,580
may take their share
of the reward and leave.

5
00:01:59,229 --> 00:01:59,950
Mr. Xiao,

6
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,040
you saved us

7
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,070
in our moment of peril yesterday.

8
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,350
What is your take on his words?

9
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:10,520
Li Chenzhou is profoundly unfathomable.

10
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:13,490
It would be unwise
to confront him at this juncture,

11
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:16,090
and victory would be far from certain.

12
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,840
Aiding the border garrisons
is our most urgent priority.

13
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,400
May these treasures suffice

14
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,600
for the needs of our frontier warriors.

15
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,520
To all gathered here today
at Nantian Abyss—

16
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,240
including us, the Xiao family—we ask that

17
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,079
you temporarily set aside your grievances
with the Power Gang.

18
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,840
Chief Li,

19
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:36,710
if you wish to earn the respect
of the entire martial world,

20
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,910
then let all witnesses
hold you to your words today.

21
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,310
May your actions match your promises.

22
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:42,960
Great!

23
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,840
It's a deal.

24
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:49,650
Since Mr. Xiao has spoken,

25
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,960
my Haisha Gang will honor this request.

26
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,910
Today, my Haisha Gang
relinquishes all claim to our reward

27
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,280
and dedicate them

28
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,280
entirely to the frontier soldiers.

29
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,310
Our Baibu Sect waives our share as well.

30
00:02:58,310 --> 00:02:59,150
We too waive ours.

31
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:00,150
-We too waive ours.
-Right!

32
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,080
-Right!
-We will waive ours!

33
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,080
I... I won't take any.

34
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,870
-Allocate all to the border garrisons!
-All to the border!

35
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,280
-Allocate all to the border garrisons!
-All to the border!

36
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,470
-All to the border!
-All to the border!

37
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,520
-All to the border!
-We can't take it.

38
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,450
We'll donate it!

39
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,310
-All to the front line!
-All to the border!

40
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,370
-Yes!
-All to them!

41
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,040
-All to the front line!
-All to the border!

42
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,710
Help out.

43
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:18,960
Take this.

44
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,050
And this one too.

45
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:22,850
Be careful.

46
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,560
Careful. Let's go.

47
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,530
It's really heavy!

48
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:28,870
Be careful not to spill it.

49
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:29,360
Here!

50
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,400
-Be careful.
-Yes.

51
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:33,910
Right!

52
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,790
What are you sneaking around here
looking for?

53
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,600
Li Chenzhou.

54
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,360
What do you mean by this?

55
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,540
Check it for yourself.

56
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,269
Northern Wastelander!

57
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,600
Northern Wastelander?

58
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,800
How is that possible?

59
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,040
These Northern Wastelanders
were brought here by you.

60
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,870
Perhaps you should be asking yourself
that question.

61
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:28,870
Hold your tongue!

62
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,000
How could you possibly be
Northern Wastelanders?

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,510
Weren't you here
to help the Xiao family?

64
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:38,390
You were the one who brought us here.

65
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,480
You can't possibly be unaware of

66
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,940
who we really are, can you?

67
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,190
Yiren,

68
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,090
what exactly is going on here?

69
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:45,800
They are clearly

70
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,159
new disciples we recruited
for the Xiao family!

71
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:48,750
Yiren,

72
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,970
someone is clearly setting you up.

73
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,190
Speak!

74
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,120
Why did you impersonate
disciples of the Xiao family

75
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,630
and frame me as a Northern Wasteland spy?

76
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,160
Why?

77
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,720
A nobody like you

78
00:05:16,230 --> 00:05:18,560
isn't even worth the effort to frame.

79
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,720
Xiao Yiren,

80
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,830
I never imagined you would stoop so low

81
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:26,480
as to collude
with the Northern Wastelanders.

82
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,610
That's not how it is!

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,630
No, they—

84
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,630
they were supposed to help me

85
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,070
restore the Xiao family!

86
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,750
Why has it come to this?

87
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:35,920
Why?

88
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,830
Who are you really?

89
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,040
Why are you doing this to me?

90
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,270
Why!

91
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,040
Big Brother.

92
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,310
How do things stand?

93
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,510
We've searched everywhere,

94
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,370
but we still haven't found Yiren.

95
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,870
Yiren would never collude
with the Northern Wastelanders.

96
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,600
He must have fallen into a trap.

97
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,320
Once the truth is uncovered,

98
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,800
the Xiao family will give a full account
to everyone.

99
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,160
-We can trust the Xiao family.
-We can trust them.

100
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,430
The front line is under intense pressure.

101
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,920
There's no more time to delay.

102
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,120
If anyone is unwilling to assist

103
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:31,290
in escorting the treasures,
they may leave now.

104
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:33,680
Mr. Xiao,

105
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,000
we trust you.

106
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,920
We await your investigation
into this matter.

107
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,920
Don't you look down on us, Power Gang!

108
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,830
If Power Gang honors its pledge

109
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,830
to deliver the treasures
to the front line,

110
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,310
my Haisha Gang

111
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:47,800
will mobilize all its resources
to contribute again in the future!

112
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,600
Indeed, when Daxi's survival
is at stake,

113
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,800
it is our duty to lend a hand!

114
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,430
Let's just focus on
escorting the treasures first!

115
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,800
-Right.
-Well said.

116
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,800
-Yes.
-Let's escort the treasures!

117
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,270
Mr. Xiao,

118
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,210
our Chief has asked me to relay a message:

119
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,510
we must trouble you

120
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,520
to oversee the subsequent matters
regarding the treasures.

121
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,460
As for your parents' remains,

122
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,800
the Power Gang will
arrange for their return

123
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,260
to the Xiao family once affairs
are settled.

124
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,370
Let's move out!

125
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,270
The Power Gang is just leaving like that?

126
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,750
Right.

127
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,720
Li Chenzhou is a man of profound cunning.

128
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,750
He used this scheme
to eliminate his rivals

129
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,750
while publicly presenting the treasures
to the border garrisons,

130
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,150
winning the people's favor in the process.

131
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,190
Mr. Xiao!

132
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,570
Mr. Xiao, please stay!

133
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,010
We must thank you once more.

134
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,480
Had you not aided us

135
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,430
in navigating the poisonous miasma
of Nantian Abyss,

136
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,040
we would have surely perished.

137
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,870
This life-saving grace

138
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,270
is akin to a second birth.

139
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,720
We beg you to accept our humble bow!

140
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,830
Chief Sha,

141
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,480
it was but a trivial effort—

142
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,610
think nothing of it!

143
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,360
Mr. Xiao,

144
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,040
our Haisha Gang has long been overlooked
in the martial world.

145
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,360
Having witnessed your capabilities today,

146
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,750
if you would accept our allegiance,

147
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,000
we vow to follow you

148
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:05,360
through fire and water

149
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,160
whenever you may have need of us!

150
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,130
Thank you, all.

151
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,640
Northern Wastelanders!

152
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,670
Sect Leader Xiao,

153
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,900
I sent my people to assist you.

154
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,360
Why then do you draw your blade
against them?

155
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,440
You deceived me
into leading the Northern Wastelanders

156
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,630
to Nantian Abyss
to seize the treasures.

157
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,000
Just who are you?

158
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,720
Xiao Yiren,

159
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,100
who I am is of little consequence.

160
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,550
What matters is

161
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:42,510
that aligning with me
is now your only path forward.

162
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:45,670
What exactly are you scheming
by using the Xiao family

163
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:48,000
to lure the Northern Wastelanders
into Nantian Abyss?

164
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,840
Sect Leader Xiao, you may not be aware,

165
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,720
but when the Northern Wastelanders
breached the capital,

166
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,200
Daxi's imperial jade seal

167
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,910
vanished along with that treasure trove.

168
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:58,150
If we can recover the seal now

169
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,840
and return it to its rightful place,

170
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,960
you would be performing
a great service for Daxi!

171
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,600
What?

172
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,030
Are you saying the Northern Wastelanders
stole the jade seal

173
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,630
to present it to the Emperor?

174
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,130
How could that be possible!

175
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,150
Having long lived in the martial world,

176
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,670
you might struggle
to grasp the intricacies of court affairs.

177
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,730
But consider this:

178
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,720
if the Northern Wastelanders

179
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,360
were to return the jade seal
to His Majesty,

180
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,360
transforming conflict into harmony,

181
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,030
wouldn't that spare the people
from the ravages of war?

182
00:10:28,030 --> 00:10:30,150
Isn't it a truly auspicious outcome!

183
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,320
And what about the lands
north of the river?

184
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,440
Would they not be forever lost,

185
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,960
dashing any hope of reunifying Daxi?

186
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,600
Recovering lost territory
is merely a fantasy

187
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,200
held by you martial artists.

188
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,000
In truth, His Majesty

189
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,630
has no desire for war
with the Northern Wastelanders—

190
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:46,480
he merely lacks an opportunity

191
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,840
for reconciliation.

192
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,510
Sect Leader Xiao,

193
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,080
this presents you with a perfect chance

194
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:55,030
to foster peace between both sides

195
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:57,200
and fulfill the Emperor's wishes.

196
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,200
If that were the case,

197
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,790
wouldn't our Xiao family

198
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,770
be condemned throughout history

199
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,360
as traitors who sold out the nation?

200
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,960
The affairs of the empire

201
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,390
are far beyond your concerns, Xiao Yiren.

202
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,270
Should His Majesty be pleased,

203
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,400
he will richly reward the Xiao family.

204
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,390
By then,

205
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,750
even granting the Huanhua Sect
an imperial plaque would be effortless.

206
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,480
With that, not only
the martial world of Jindu

207
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,960
but even the martial world
of the Central Plains

208
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,090
would have to defer to the Xiao family.

209
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,720
Who are you really!

210
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,150
Just who are you?

211
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,910
Excellent, you're all back!

212
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,910
Qiushui!

213
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,200
Big Brother! You've finally returned!

214
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:46,930
You're back!

215
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:49,360
We've been waiting for you for so long.

216
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,890
Look, everything is built!

217
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,360
It's exactly the same as it was.

218
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,000
Are you satisfied, Mr. Xiao?

219
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:06,270
I, Xiao Qiushui, extend my
deepest gratitude for your assistance!

220
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,630
Mr. Xiao,
there's no need for such courtesy.

221
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,490
From now on, we are all one family.

222
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,200
The martial sects of Guangling
are at the disposal

223
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,440
of the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

224
00:12:14,670 --> 00:12:15,960
Mr. Xiao, since you are satisfied,

225
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,360
we can rest assured then.

226
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,750
We'll take our leave now!

227
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:21,480
-We take our leave!
-After you, we take our leave!

228
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,050
Big Brother,

229
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,670
come quickly to the training ground

230
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,750
and see what I've built with my own hands!

231
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,210
Hold on,

232
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,510
what do you mean
you built it with your own hands?

233
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:34,510
This was a joint effort by everyone.

234
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:36,440
Yes, true, everyone contributed.

235
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,670
-They contributed too!
-Great!

236
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:38,440
Then today,

237
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,840
let's drink to our hearts' content!

238
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,650
Where can we find good wine?

239
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:46,720
Wouldn't dream of leaving you out!

240
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:48,550
But...

241
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,000
Hero Zuoqiu.

242
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,000
Why are you looking at me?

243
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,670
I have matters to attend to.
I'll take my leave now.

244
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:01,870
It's okay.

245
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,630
Qiushui...

246
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,550
Qiushui!

247
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,790
Qiushui...

248
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,080
Qiu...

249
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:12,630
Kaiyan!

250
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:13,600
Kaiyan!

251
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,120
Kaiyan!

252
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,030
Qiushui!

253
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,120
How are you feeling now?

254
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,450
How did you get injured?

255
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:29,610
I went with Yiren
to pursue the Northern Wastelanders,

256
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,790
but in the blink of an eye,

257
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,960
Yiren vanished.

258
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,790
The paths in Nantian Abyss
are treacherous,

259
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,960
and I had no choice

260
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,240
but to retreat on my own.

261
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,740
Third Young Master! Third Young Master!

262
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,510
Zhao Shirong has arrived

263
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,370
with the remains of your parents.

264
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:19,670
Mother.

265
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:28,510
Father!

266
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,200
Mother!

267
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:38,390
Father!

268
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,720
Mother.

269
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,270
Z—Zhao Shirong!

270
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,550
Your Power Gang

271
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:02,390
has brought ruin to my Xiao family,
leaving us broken and bereft.

272
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,630
and now you dare come here
with my parents' remains?

273
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
I, Xiao Kaiyan,

274
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:12,120
swear to have my revenge
for this blood debt!

275
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,840
Kaiyan! Kaiyan!

276
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,200
Everyone, hold!

277
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,460
She was sent by Li Chenzhou

278
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
to return our parents' remains.

279
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:37,670
Kaiyan,

280
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,380
back in Nantian Abyss,

281
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,090
Li Chenzhou claimed

282
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:44,960
that the Power Gang was not
responsible for

283
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,440
the deaths of our parents
and the Xiao family members.

284
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:51,840
He said

285
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:55,320
the true culprit was someone else.

286
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,000
Qiushui,

287
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,120
the Power Gang is the culprit.

288
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:05,680
How could you let yourself
be deceived by them?

289
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,480
He showed me

290
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,440
evidence I couldn't refute.

291
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:12,480
Li Chenzhou promised me

292
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,250
that within 3 days, he would

293
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,330
bring our parents' remains back to us.

294
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,240
He also swore

295
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,510
he would expose

296
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,000
the true mastermind behind their murders.

297
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,020
Since everyone is here today,

298
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,240
tell us—

299
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:45,550
what else did Li Chenzhou say?

300
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:49,880
Your parents were killed
by the Marrow-Disrupting Finger.

301
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,320
Marrow-Disrupting Finger?

302
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,000
What kind of nonsense is that?

303
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,000
This technique was left behind

304
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,870
decades ago

305
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,550
by the Old Master of Tuoshan.

306
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:03,030
Qiushui,

307
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,160
Qiushui, don't listen to her excuses.

308
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:09,160
She's only trying
to absolve the Power Gang—

309
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,069
you mustn't believe her!

310
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,420
The iron sand is the proof.

311
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,290
Using the Two Form Needle,

312
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:21,680
I've forced the iron sands,
left by the Marrow-Disrupting Finger,

313
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,140
to gather at their wrists.

314
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,950
You may see for yourself.

315
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:52,750
Are you saying
this Marrow-Disrupting Finger technique

316
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:55,590
was passed down decades ago
by the Old Master of Tuoshan?

317
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,400
So who did he

318
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:58,630
pass the technique to back then?

319
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,720
From what I've uncovered,

320
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,450
he only had 3 direct disciples,

321
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,240
each from 3 prominent

322
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,150
southern martial families.

323
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:11,110
The first was from the Fei family,
one of the Three Great Mystical Sects.

324
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,000
The second was from the Deng family

325
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,370
of the Qianxi Division, Hailin Sect.

326
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:18,510
My family?

327
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,240
Zhao Shirong,

328
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,880
do you have proof
for what you're claiming?

329
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,640
Yuhan.

330
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,600
And who was the third?

331
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,910
The third was from the Tang Sect.

332
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,160
Indeed,

333
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,890
this technique is extremely rigid

334
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,760
and can only be practiced by men.

335
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,270
Within the Tang Sect,

336
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:51,720
the one who cultivated it is Tang Yaoshun.

337
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:04,010
Don't misunderstand!

338
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:06,720
My father has been bedridden for years

339
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,250
and hasn't left the Tang Sect
in nearly a year.

340
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,030
The Marrow-Disrupting Finger technique

341
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:14,960
requires mobilizing
all of one's internal energy,

342
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,550
so it's impossible for it
to have been my father.

343
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:18,400
Indeed,

344
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,200
Tang Yaoshun's internal energy
is now greatly diminished—

345
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,720
it's impossible for him to have executed
the Marrow-Disrupting Finger.

346
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,200
Therefore, the murderer of your parents

347
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,250
must be from
one of the other two families.

348
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,000
he practitioner from the Fei family

349
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,590
is its sect leader, Fei Yuqiao.

350
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:39,750
From the Deng family, it is Deng Qingfeng.

351
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,210
Big Brother,

352
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,590
I have never seen my father
use this technique,

353
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:47,440
nor have I ever heard of him
studying under the Old Master of Tuoshan!

354
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:48,200
Yuhan,

355
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:52,070
I don't believe your father
would harm the Xiao family.

356
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,000
In that case,

357
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,200
I shall seek out Fei Yuqiao
of the Fei family first.

358
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,680
Testing his skills will reveal the truth.

359
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,200
Hold on.

360
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:03,160
Before you depart,

361
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,760
Mr. Xiao, there is a place
you must visit first.

362
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,240
Chenzhou said he has urgent matters
to discuss with you.

363
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,370
I must ask you to come

364
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,680
to the Power Gang's main headquarters.

365
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,950
This will grant you unrestricted access
to the Power Gang's headquarters.

366
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,880
I will take my leave.

367
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:42,550
Kaiyan,

368
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:47,160
our parents deserve to be laid
to rest as soon as possible.

369
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,290
Could you make a trip down the mountain

370
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:50,840
to prepare the coffins?

371
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,940
Also, please inform Yiren and Xueyu.

372
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,320
Big Brother, we'll go help too.

373
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,200
Please accept our condolences.

374
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:29,070
You agreed to go to the
Power Gang's headquarters just like that?

375
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:31,200
Aren't you afraid they might harm you?

376
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,660
Perhaps it's for the best—

377
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,880
this might allow us
to uncover other clues.

378
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,040
Then be careful!

379
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,110
Mother!

380
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,030
Father!

381
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,790
I've finally found you!

382
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,350
I've finally found you!

383
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:31,790
I have a wild thought.

384
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,830
Could it be that someone else here

385
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,310
shares my experience?

386
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,530
Perhaps someone else has also
transmigrated into this story.

387
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,270
Reset it then!

388
00:23:47,830 --> 00:23:48,830
Reset.

389
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,640
Buff the character
with more golden cheats.

390
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,350
Reset.

391
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,830
Did you forget his catchphrase?

392
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,310
Reset! Reset!

393
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,270
Reset! Reset! Reset!

394
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,480
Mingming,

395
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,510
today's the deadline
for topic submissions.

396
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:29,110
Why haven't you shown up yet?

397
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:48,970
You can do this!

398
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,790
I've been staying up
past 10 PM every night reading—

399
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,790
it's so addictive!
Can we get an extra chapter?

400
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,590
This chapter has only 2,000 words.

401
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,510
I need more!

402
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,270
The romance subplot
could use some work…

403
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:44,030
Last night's update
was absolutely god-tier!

404
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:45,790
You're definitely
topping the monthly rankings this time!

405
00:25:45,790 --> 00:25:46,830
The plot's solid,

406
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,580
though the romance subplot
could use some work…

407
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,510
The enchanting senior sisters?
Absolutely perfect!

408
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:53,640
Nanda, I love you!

409
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,790
Nanda!

410
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:58,960
Utterly shameless!

411
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,730
You're nothing but a fraud!

412
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,960
Hero Xiao, you truly live up
to being a martial arts prodigy!

413
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,490
Thirty-one weeks
atop the monthly rankings,

414
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,960
and only you could pull that off!

415
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,070
You deserve an extra chicken drumstick!

416
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,470
I don't like drumsticks.

417
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,330
Hey, kids shouldn't be picky eaters!

418
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,350
Nanda!

419
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,880
All this screeching

420
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,830
can only mean one thing:
Nanda is making a grand entrance!

421
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,270
Same dramatic antics every time!

422
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:29,400
What a riot! And he has the nerve
to enjoy the screeching!

423
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,490
Keep it down, he's here!

424
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,790
So this is Nanda's studio?

425
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,030
The aesthetic is so classy!

426
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:38,030
Senior, I just finished
the latest chapter of "Chief".

427
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,880
It was incredible!

428
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,480
I was up all night reading it!

429
00:26:40,590 --> 00:26:41,790
Good morning, Mr. Li.

430
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,440
Mr. Li.

431
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:50,110
Thanks for your hard work.

432
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,960
Not at all.

433
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,310
Just doing my job.

434
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:55,830
It's so stylish, isn't it?

435
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,270
Exactly!

436
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:56,960
Keep at it,

437
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,360
and you'll get there!

438
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,640
Chinese Literature Department
is something else—

439
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,000
a real powerhouse of talents.

440
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,310
As soon as one group graduates,

441
00:27:06,310 --> 00:27:08,640
another pops up, seamlessly taking over!

442
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,280
Wasn't I just one of them back then?

443
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,920
Alas!

444
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:18,330
I, unworthy Li Cai,

445
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,960
will take my leave.

446
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:22,950
He's nothing but a complete con artist!

447
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,480
You're here.

448
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,310
Let me have a look.

449
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:36,950
A pure martial arts story

450
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,160
with patriotic fervor—

451
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,120
that's not a bad concept.

452
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:44,960
Though this genre...

453
00:27:47,510 --> 00:27:48,110
Ah, right!

454
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:51,110
I just brought back two boxes of tea
from out of town.

455
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,710
I'll have you try some later.

456
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,400
Senior.

457
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,400
Thank you.

458
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,310
As we discussed earlier,

459
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,570
if the Chief's metrics are strong,

460
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,030
the company will formally

461
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,630
offer me an author contract.

462
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,650
The metrics are indeed strong,

463
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,410
but you seem a bit tired lately.

464
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,200
The update pace has slowed,

465
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,550
and readers are starting to comment.

466
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,400
How about this:

467
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,070
draft a few more chapters
of Li the Immortal's storyline?

468
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,000
That arc has better momentum.

469
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,880
But Li the Immortal
has already been written off the story!

470
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,440
Reset it then!

471
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,440
Reset it.

472
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,200
Reset.

473
00:28:25,350 --> 00:28:26,160
Trust me,

474
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,140
buff the character
with more golden cheats.

475
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,570
Readers love it!

476
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
Readers do love a good golden cheat,

477
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:34,880
but we can't just abuse it randomly.

478
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,550
Check this.

479
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,310
Hmm... let me think it over a bit more.

480
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,800
I still really want to
stick to writing pure martial arts novels.

481
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,070
There you go again, stubborn as ever.

482
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,680
I know you have strong visions
when you write,

483
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,940
and you're tenacious.

484
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,160
That's why I've always believed in you.

485
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,640
Having lost your parents early,

486
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,970
you came straight to me after university.

487
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,960
I see you as my own younger brother.

488
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,220
Just focus on writing.

489
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,370
Don't overthink it.

490
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:11,550
Mr. Li,

491
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,110
you have been allocated a place
in the military forum.

492
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:15,750
The visit is scheduled for this week

493
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,030
under confidential conditions.

494
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,400
I will proceed
to arrange your itinerary then.

495
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,590
Okay, got it.

496
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,830
Isn't this my novel?

497
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:51,200
Sure it is.

498
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,850
What are you doing?

499
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,030
Don't charge in there!

500
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:56,000
The place is swarming with media—

501
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,640
official accounts, influencers,
verified megablogs…

502
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,700
Are you trying to trend on headlines?

503
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,750
But "Chief II" uses the outline

504
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:03,030
for my new book!

505
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:04,350
Isn't it obvious?

506
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,110
He just wants to keep you

507
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,310
as the man behind the scenes permanently.

508
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,640
Enough with
this "man behind the scenes" talk.

509
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,500
I don't get it, and I don't care to.

510
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,920
Yes, he's utterly shameless!

511
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,110
But have you forgotten his catchphrase?

512
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,160
Reset!

513
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,750
Reset! Reset!

514
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:17,920
Let me tell you:

515
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,720
that computer in his office

516
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,680
hasn't been booted up in ages.

517
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,110
He's run out of ideas long ago!

518
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,110
He's counting on you to reset him.

519
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,200
Once everyone leaves,

520
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,930
I will get to the bottom of this.

521
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:31,140
Looks like you haven't endured
enough corporate life yet.

522
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,440
Senior,

523
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,490
the synopsis for "Chief II"

524
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,350
is identical to my "Hero on the Way"!

525
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,200
Mingming,

526
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,110
you're overthinking this.

527
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,030
I had "Chief II"

528
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,200
planned out 6 months ago.

529
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:46,480
Here we go again!

530
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,790
You've been swamped with meetings

531
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:50,000
and client dinners every single day
for the past 6 months.

532
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,720
When did you even have time
to develop the concept?

533
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,310
What?

534
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,640
Are you suggesting
a web novel master like me

535
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,640
would stoop to stealing your ideas?

536
00:30:58,310 --> 00:30:59,400
This is my novel.

537
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,810
Listen carefully:

538
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,070
I won't ghostwrite for you anymore.

539
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,560
I demand credit for my work.

540
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:08,920
Mingming,

541
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,750
you don't seem to understand.

542
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,440
The copyright holds real value

543
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,590
only in my name.

544
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,400
Who'd even notice otherwise?

545
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,160
Besides,

546
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,750
look at all you've written before.

547
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:18,950
Did any of it take off?

548
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,310
Young people need to stay grounded.

549
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:23,800
I will give you opportunities.

550
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:27,790
Senior,

551
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,920
you used to be

552
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,410
a role model for all of us
in the Chinese Literature Department.

553
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,760
I hope you can be honest with me now.

554
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,440
It's complicated,

555
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,010
and you wouldn't understand.

556
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:54,590
Besides, I have a meeting
to attend shortly.

557
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:55,590
We'll talk later.

558
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,550
Just accept it.

559
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,110
Isn't this ideal?

560
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,590
Being a ghostwriter means

561
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,480
steady pay.

562
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,170
Plus, you don't need to
worry about what to write.

563
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:16,200
He denies plagiarizing
and keeps feeding me lies.

564
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,730
I won't let him
steal my labor of love anymore.

565
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:21,250
Come on, buddy!
This is the corporate world,

566
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,040
not the martial world. Come on.

567
00:32:24,550 --> 00:32:25,720
Remember that beta software

568
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,050
"Magic Code Novel" I mentioned last time?

569
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,000
Give it a shot!

570
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,970
They say the Magic Code Novel's

571
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,790
AI interactive writing feature
already includes

572
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:37,790
the Marvelous Heroes of Shenzhou
by Master Wen Ruian—

573
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:41,480
the exact story you're adapting!

574
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,200
See? It's practically made

575
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,330
to fulfill your martial arts fantasy.

576
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,270
Magic Code Novel...

577
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,640
Wait, no!

578
00:33:43,510 --> 00:33:44,480
My draft!

579
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,110
-Third Young Master!
-Third Young Master, wake up!

580
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:53,480
Wake up, Third Young Master!

581
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,550
Third Young Master.

582
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:56,150
Third Young Master, wake up.

583
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,750
-The Third Young Master is awake!
-The Third Young Master is awake!

584
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:01,750
I remember now...

585
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:04,000
Right before I arrived here,

586
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:07,310
I wasn't just compiling
the Magic Codex Novel at home—

587
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:09,810
I've lost a critical fragment of memory.

588
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,150
This is too difficult!

589
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,020
Why are you still here?

590
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:35,760
Stop waiting.

591
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,219
Your senior isn't coming.

592
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,400
Ever since you brought up
the outline issue,

593
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,360
he's vanished.

594
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:42,760
He's clearly avoiding you.

595
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,659
Come on, let's grab some food.

596
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:48,699
I'll skip that.

597
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,230
You go home first.

598
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:52,239
I'll wait a bit longer here.

599
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,070
Very well.

600
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,380
I, unworthy Li Cai,

601
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,290
will take my leave now.

602
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,660
Do remember to eat something.

603
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,050
Ugh, just my luck...

604
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,990
What in the world is this?

605
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,440
Hey,

606
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,070
the materials are ready.

607
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,320
I'll send them via the usual method.

608
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,400
and regular gears

609
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,260
won't make it past checks.

610
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,460
Lucky you prepped
the special equipment for me.

611
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,930
Don't worry, it's handled.

612
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,000
Senior,

613
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:15,770
what are you doing?

614
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,680
Still on the clock, I see?

615
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,890
Did you get these stuff

616
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,360
secretly at the military forum event?

617
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,200
What are you talking about?

618
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,940
I don't understand a word.

619
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:49,080
Oh, you don't understand...

620
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:52,130
I'll call the police then.

621
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,060
Let the police do the investigation.

622
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:56,960
Enough games.

623
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,000
Just name your price.

624
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,710
Is it money,

625
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,340
a new book deal,

626
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:05,490
or authorship credit?

627
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:07,800
It's all negotiable.

628
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,090
My personal grievances can wait.

629
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:17,370
But selling state secrets
to foreign entities?

630
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,450
That's an entirely different matter.

631
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,440
Let go.

632
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:47,240
Give it to me.

633
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,280
Release it now!

634
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,550
Reset.

635
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,070
It's him!

636
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,800
If Li Nan has been

637
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,480
in this storyworld

638
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:17,570
since the day I arrived...

639
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,090
I was willing to die to alter the plot,

640
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,970
to make Yiren rush home
with reinforcements.

641
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,250
Yet he still fell into an ambush...

642
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,840
I diverted fate itself,

643
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,030
but couldn't stop the massacre.

644
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:33,880
Could it be that Li Nan

645
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,540
twisted the narrative again?

646
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,090
Moreover...

647
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,070
Your parents weren't killed
by the Power Gang.

648
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,230
When I gave my order
regarding the Xiao family,

649
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:45,000
I ordered to only surround
the Xiao Residence, not to kill.

650
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,670
But by the time the second group
of Power Gang forces arrived,

651
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,190
the Xiao family's Sword Manor
had already been breached.

652
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:54,030
The one
who slaughtered your Xiao family...

653
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,690
must have come from
within your own Sword Manor.

654
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:59,070
If the Sword Manor
had already been breached

655
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,760
from within
before the Power Gang even arrived...

656
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:04,150
then the ones who killed Mother and Father
must be different perpetrators.

657
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:07,320
Could Li Nan have an accomplice
hidden within the Xiao family?

658
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,190
What identity is he using now

659
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:11,320
to infiltrate so deeply?

660
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,760
Who... is he exactly?

661
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:28,800
Big Brother.

662
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,050
Big Brother!

663
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,630
Yuhan,

664
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,800
something's weighing on your mind.

665
00:40:46,230 --> 00:40:49,110
That day when the Xiao family
Sword Forge was besieged,

666
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,670
I vowed to you that

667
00:40:51,110 --> 00:40:53,840
I would seek my father's
help to aid Huanhua Sect.

668
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,080
But I never imagined,

669
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,450
he'd hesitate and stand by,

670
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,920
doing nothing.

671
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,060
I've always felt I failed you.

672
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:07,880
Yuhan,

673
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,440
no matter what your father did,

674
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,500
you'll always be my brother for life.

675
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:15,760
Besides,
the Marrow-Disrupting Finger theory

676
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,290
is still just speculation.

677
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,360
Don't overthink it.

678
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:23,160
Back when we 4 brothers swore our oath,

679
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,130
I said to you:

680
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,170
no matter what happens,

681
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,170
no matter when it happens,

682
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:33,670
you'll always be my Big Brother;
I'll follow you through thick and thin.

683
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:35,800
I'll go with you back to the Hailin Sect

684
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,780
to confront my father
and uncover the truth.

685
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,630
Alright,

686
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,540
it's better than letting
the doubt torment you.

687
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,150
Wait for me to return.
