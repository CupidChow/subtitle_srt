Tang Rou, I'll go save the others first.

4
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:55,560
I probably won't need the entire jar
of Nether Dew.

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,229
Your sister wants Nether Dew as a gift,

6
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,900
but she doesn't necessarily
need the whole jar, right?

7
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,170
That's right, Fang.

8
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,800

Let's begin.

19
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,810
Before removing the dart, let's talk.

20
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,370
I have nothing to talk about with you.

21
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,400
Fine. Let's not talk then.

22
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,290
I'm warning you—

23
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,400
Rou is innocent and trusting.

24
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,910
He keeps calling you Big Brother now.

25
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,470
I'm afraid he's been thoroughly
deceived by you.

26
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,030
I don't care what happened
between you two before,

27
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,560
but stay away from Rou from now on.

28

Alright.

29
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,040
Smart choice.

30
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,560
I do agree,

31
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,150
but whether Rou wants to follow me or not

32
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,310
isn't up to me.

33
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,220
You have to ask him.

34
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,970
Don't worry about that.
Just keep your promise.

35
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:43,270
Your set of tools looks well-prepared.

36
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,430

in removing darts, aren't you?

38
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,310
If the dart were shot by me,
you'd be dead by now.

39
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,640
There wouldn't be any chance to remove it.

I wonder what he meant.

178

Purple Phoenix attacked you
on Sword King's orders?

185
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,200
Whoever gets the Hero Command Token
for Chief

186
00:16:28,630 --> 00:16:30,150
will earn great merit,

187
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,850
and Sword King and I
have never gotten along.

188
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:34,840
If he gets it,

189
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,320
he'll naturally use it against me.

190
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,640
Yet, as it turns out,

191
00:16:42,790 --> 00:16:45,520
he has unwittingly delivered me
a masterstroke.

192
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,600
You're blessed with great fortune, Master,

193
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,720
having met that guy from the Xiao family.

194
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,790
I heard they formed

195
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,270
something called
Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

196
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:55,000
Always talking about chivalry.
How ridiculous.

197
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,810
In this martial world,

198
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,750
the word "righteousness"
has long since died.

199
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,160
They're just a bunch of hypocrites,

200
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,560
chasing profit
yet too ashamed to admit it.

201
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,400
Sooner or later, they'll kneel before
our Power Gang.

202
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,589
The Huanhua Sect is easy to defend
but hard to attack.

203
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:15,480
Using this identity
to go with Xiao Qiushui

204
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,200
will truly make things much easier.

205
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:19,200
The Hero's Token

206
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,460
will soon be in your possession, Master.

207
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:24,000
Then you can bring the Xiao family
under your control.

208
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,480
Let's see how that Sword King
can fight against you then.

209
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,540
The Xiao family doesn't deserve to be
under my command.

210
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,510
I still have a score to settle with them.

211
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,760
By the way,

212
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:43,030
don't let Sword King know of
my whereabouts.

213
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:45,760
This Xiao Qiushui
does resemble Chief somewhat.

214
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,880
In our gang, only the Eight Kings

215
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,470
have seen the true faces of me and Chief.

216
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,070
Even if the Eight Kings see him,

217
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,930
they won't mistake him for Chief.

218
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,980
No need to report this.

219
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,510
Just wait for my instructions.

220
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,030
Got it.

221
00:17:59,350 --> 00:18:02,350
I'll wait near Huanhua Sect
for your message, Master.

222
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,930
Big Brother.

223
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:07,310
What do you think of this?

224
00:18:07,310 --> 00:18:08,840
I think this is pretty good.

225
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,250
Thank you all for saving me.

226
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:25,440
Mr. Feng, seeing you like this,

227
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,360
are you feeling better?

228
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,080
I'm much better now.
I can't thank you enough.

229
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,170
Don't mention it, Mr. Feng.

230
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,170
Our Big Brother

231
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,160
was actually looking for someone
named Feng Lang.

232
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,160
We never expected to really find you.

233
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,360
I'm just a nobody not worth mentioning.

234
00:18:41,310 --> 00:18:43,400
I spoke ill before,

235
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,310
Mr. Xiao, yet you didn't take offense

236
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:49,590
and even saved me multiple times.
I'm truly grateful for that.

237
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:53,390
Should you ever require my service
in the future, I shall not refuse.

238
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,260
That's not important.

239
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,300
What matters is...

240
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,280
Do you consider me a friend?

241
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:06,270
Do you now consider me your best friend?

242
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,510
Mr. Xiao, you're my close friend.

243
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,160
Alright.

244
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,270
That's good then.

245
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,270
Actually, it's quite a coincidence.

246
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,830
After much effort, the Iron-Clad Constable
entrusted someone to find my master,

247
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,680
asking me to deliver a letter to him
at Huanhua Sect.

248
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,340
It just so happens
I can travel with you, Mr. Xiao

249
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,310
Y-You've just recovered from poisoning.

250
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,480
There must still be some residual toxins
in your body.

251
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,340
How about this?

252
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,350
Come back with me to Huanhua Sect,

253
00:19:37,350 --> 00:19:40,110
and I'll find someone to help clear
the remaining poison from your body.

254
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,110
What do you think?

255
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:42,270
Okay.

256
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,130
Where's my wine?

257
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,550
If there's no wine, nobody leaves.

258
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,440
Fang.

259
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,160
Wait here.

260
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Can this wine fool her, Big Brother?

261
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:23,550
Feng, please don't be angry.

262
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,830
You're already injured,

263
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,640
and now you've caught a cold
from the water.

264
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,640
It'll get worse if we don't treat it.

265
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:32,560
Here's the medicine. Come on, take it.

266
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,110
Are you Tang Fang from the Tang Sect?

267
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,970
And who are you?

268
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,750
I am Feng Lang, the owner of
the Rain Sword.

269
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,410
So you're that sickly fellow
who used up all the Nether Dew.

270
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,920
Let me tell you, you're part of this too.

271
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,400
Fang.

272
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,600
Your wine.

273
00:21:37,270 --> 00:21:38,030
Fang!

274
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,350
You're fooling me. It's all fake!

275
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:49,200
Tang Fang, I've put up with you
long enough.

276
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,680
If it weren't for Tang Rou's sake...

277
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,820
Let me tell you.

278
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,950
If it weren't for you all,

279
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,370
I would have already
knocked the Omniscience Door open.

280
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:01,890
Keep brewing. If you can't get it done,
don't sleep.

281
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,510
Miss.

282
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,870
You're heading to the Omniscience Door

283
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:08,920
to consult Jade Cicada,

284
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,030
hoping to gain some insight
into the martial world, right?

285
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,760
Perhaps I can be of assistance.

286
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,790
You?

287
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:19,990
I'm somewhat acquainted with Jade Cicada.

288
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:23,960
Give him this jade pendant,

289
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,160
and he'll speak once.

290
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,620
Just this one jade pendant

291
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,290
to make Jade Cicada speak?

292
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,550
You must be a fraud too, aren't you?

293
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:50,010
I'm about to go to Huanhua Sect
with Mr. Xiao.

294
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,270
If this doesn't work,

295
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,400
you can come find me.

296
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:55,000
That's better than wasting time here.

297
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,030
Fine.

298
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,210
Huanhua Sect is not far from
our Tang Sect.

299
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,240
You won't get away.

300
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:05,550
Hold on.

301
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:24,280
My friend helped you. You should
return the favor, don't you think?

302
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,080
Fang, your Silver Butterfly Dart
is going deeper and deeper.

303
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,830
If you don't remove it now,

304
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,760
Big Brother will truly be injured.

305
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:56,110
Tang Rou, friends like these

306
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,680
are best avoided.

307
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,210
I'll take you home as soon as
I finish my business.

308
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,440
Fang...

309
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,790
Big Brother, are you okay?

310
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,330
Seriously, still touching me?

311
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:08,790
Sorry, I won't touch you again.

312
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,310
Bear with it. It'll stop hurting soon.

313
00:24:10,310 --> 00:24:12,440
Don't worry. It's no big deal.

314
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,920
This Jade Cicada

315
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:20,580
can gather information
from the martial world.

316
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,880
That does sound impressive.

317
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,680
Mr. Feng, how did you come to know him?

318
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,000
By chance, just like you and me.

319
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:34,030
We were strangers just days ago,

320
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:35,890
and now we're friends, aren't we?

321
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,510
I see.

322
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,590
Well, I have a problem now.

323
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,720
My brother Yiren

324
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,780
will soon become the young sect leader
of Huanhua Sect.

325
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,530
Mr. Feng,

326
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:53,160
how should I compete with him
for this position?

327
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:55,680
You want to be the leader of Huanhua Sect?

328
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,480
That's right.

329
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,960
You're far behind your brother.

330
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,160
However, there's a rule in Jinzhong

331
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,350
that if a young hero

332
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,240
can get a recommendation from
a renowned master in the martial world,

333
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,170
they can challenge the successor.

334
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,010
A renowned master in the martial world...

335
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,240
Got it.

336
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:28,030
[Omniscience Door]

337
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,730
This is Tang Fang of the Tang Sect,
requesting to see Master Yu.

338
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,720
I have something of your old friend.

339
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,480
Please grant me a single word, Sir.

340
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,750
Indeed, that's Master's style.

341
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,040
Since you're a friend of Master's,

342
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,400
go ahead and ask.

343
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,310
Where exactly is the Voidheart Codex?

344
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,160
In the Xiao Residence of Huanhua Sect.

345
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,960
The Xiao Residence.

346
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,030
So the rumors are true.

347
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,000
Old Madam Wu is indeed hiding
in the Xiao Residence.

348
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,590
Greetings, Old Madam Wu.

349
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:07,470
Please, have a seat.

350
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,400
Old Madam Wu, are you feeling better?

351
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:21,990
[Old Madam Wu]

352
00:27:19,330 --> 00:27:22,660
I'm deeply grateful that you two

353
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,880
have allowed me to take refuge here.

354
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:28,310
Just some old ailments,
nothing worth mentioning.

355
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,370
Old Madam Wu.

356
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,160
I've received a secret letter
from General Wu Jie.

357
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,280
In seven days,

358
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,400
he'll send someone to Tongfu Inn
in Lingliang Town.

359
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,800
[Zhang Linyi, Yin-Yang Divine Swordsman]

360
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,590
At that time,

361
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,400
my wife and I

362
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,830
will secretly escort you to town

363
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,800
to meet with the General.

364
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,750
Thank you both for your trouble.

365
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,310
Ever since Crazy Yan

366
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,200
entrusted me with the Hero Command Token,

367
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:59,480
the martial world has seen much bloodshed.

368
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:03,880
Even with Mr. Zhang protecting me,

369
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:05,730
I've faced danger many times.

370
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:08,470
Thanks to your Xiao family's chivalry,

371
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,510
letting me hide in the Huanhua Sect.

372
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:15,350
Otherwise, I'm afraid the Hero's Token
would have fallen into the wrong hands.

373
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,790
Old Madam Wu,
please don't say such things.

374
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,830
This is simply

375
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,110
our duty as martial artists.

376
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,830
Secrets cannot be kept
in the martial world.

377
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,270
I'm not sure whether
me hiding in the Xiao family

378
00:28:26,270 --> 00:28:29,510
can be kept secret
for the remaining seven days.

379
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:34,110
Old Madam Wu, let the martial world
handle its own troubles.

380
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:36,550
You needn't worry.

381
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,960
We'll take care of

382
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,400
everything.

383
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:45,160
[Huanhua Sect]

384
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,270
I grounded you,

385
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,580
yet you went out causing trouble.

386
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,840
Seems I was too lenient.

387
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:54,160
You're forcing me to punish you
with our family law,

388
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,820
aren't you?

389
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,720
Come on, bend over!

390
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,480
Father.

391
00:28:57,790 --> 00:29:00,070
I-I didn't go out
to cause trouble this time.

392
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,200
I had important business to deal with.

393
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,880
You?

394
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,700
What important business?

395
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,810
Being a hero, of course.

396
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,830
You? Being a hero?

397
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,830
Making up stories, huh?

398
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,440
What a nice story!
Keep making things up, huh?

399
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,680
Father, seriously, please don't hit me!

400
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,160
Look, good deeds are usually done
anonymously,

401
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,440
and those who seek recognition
rarely do good, right?

402
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,270
Really? You've really made something
of yourself, haven't you?

403
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,960
Fine. I'll grant your wish.

404
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,420
Father!

405
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,300
Stop hitting him!

406
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,510
Stop hitting him!

407
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,880
That's enough! What are you doing?

408
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,400
What am I doing? I'm disciplining him.

409
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,060
He just got back
and you're already hitting him.

410
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,720
Your sister gathered some rehmannia
from the back mountain.

411
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,000
I've already told the kitchen staff

412
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,110
to make some chicken soup

413
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:41,350
for your friends.

414
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,070
Why are you still standing there?

415
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,330
Go help in the kitchen.

416
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,070
Come on.

417
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,640
Where is he going?

418
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,700
I'm disciplining him.

419
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:53,790
You keep spoiling him like this,

420
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,830
making him more and more reckless!

421
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:58,200
You don't understand the situation at all.

422
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,200
Qiushui really wasn't messing around
this time.

423
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,840
I've already asked Yuhan and the others.

424
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,830
They did go to watch dragon boat races
in Zihui.

425
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,750
But think about it.

426
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,590
Honoring Qu Yuan
on the Dragon Boat Festival

427
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:07,270
is just a folk custom.

428
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,240
Don't you remember
that you'd go every year

429
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,750
when you were young?

430
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:12,680
One year, you even fell into the river,

431
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,000
and I was the one who pulled you out.

432
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,440
Don't bring up me falling into the river
when I was young.

433
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,240
Every time you mention this,
it's about me falling into the river.

434
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,400
Do I have any dignity left?

435
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,400
Well, did you fall into the river or not?

436
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,030
Do you know that

437
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,510
he even lost his sword?

438
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,400
A swordsman who lost his sword.

439
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,400
What kind of image is that?

440
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,000
How can I not discipline him?

441
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,350
I...

442
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,880
Who allowed you to stand up?

443
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,240
-Kneel!
-I told him to stand up.

444
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,240
You... Kneel!

445
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,570
Get out of my way.

446
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,040
You...

447
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,110
Hit me instead!

448
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,770
How could you let him stand up?

449
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,000
-Move.
-Then hit me instead.

450
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:41,930
Get out of my way!

451
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:42,640
Kneel!

452
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,000
Hit me instead!

453
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,420
Hey, you...

454
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:48,920
Mother.

455
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:51,500
Don't think I wouldn't dare!

456
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,110
Mr. Xiao.

457
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,810
Sorry we didn't welcome you properly.

458
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,720
The vigor with which you lecture your son,

459
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,320
it's been ages
since we've seen such a display.

460
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,680
Youthful impulsiveness
isn't a major fault.

461
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,880
Greetings, Mr. Xiao.

462
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,060
Alright, Mr. Xiao.

463
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,160
Let's go have some drinks.

464
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,280
That's what really matters.

465
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,200
Senior, please calm down.

466
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,920
The ceremony to appoint
the young sect leader of Huanhua Sect

467
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
Is ready outside.

468
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:23,090
We have many things to attend to soon.

469
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,480
Qiushui, come on.

470
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,790
Come thank all your uncles.

471
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,480
We'll leave then.

472
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,330
What are you standing there for? Let's go.

473
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,680
Mother, I want to be
the young sect leader.

474
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,310
[Zhu Xiawu, Iron-Clad Constable,
Liushan Sect]

475
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,010
[Kang Jiesheng, son of Kang Chuyu]
[Kang Chuyu, Sun-Gazing Divine Swordsman]

476
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,790
Qiushui, what are you talking about?

477
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,790
You want to compete with your brother?

478
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,590
Don't be ridiculous. Leave now.

479
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,480
Qiushui.

480
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
Did you hear me?

481
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,820
You're making me angry again.

482
00:32:10,510 --> 00:32:14,770
I, Xiao Qiushui, wish to compete for
the position of Huanhua's young leader.

483
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,270
It so happens that
you're all here, uncles.

484
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,000
Could you please recommend me?

485
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,310
Qiushui.

486
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,960
I'm not joking.

487
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:34,550
I sincerely ask you seniors
to give me a chance.

488
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,550
You're indeed full of vigor, young man.

489
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:41,590
But do you know

490
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,880
the position of young sect leader
has long been decided?

491
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,960
Actually, I think

492
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:48,170
we can take our time
to consider this matter further.

493
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,640
Qiushui, my wise nephew,

494
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,070
there's no need for haste.

495
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,960
No, Uncle.

496
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:54,640
I really can't wait.

497
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,240
Dear uncles,

498
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,720
if only one of you would recommend me

499
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,400
and give me a letter of recommendation.

500
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,720
Please consider me.

501
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,140
Give me a chance, will you?

502
00:33:04,310 --> 00:33:06,590
Qiushui, it's not that we're unwilling,

503
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,270
but Yiren truly deserves the position.

504
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,920
In five years, I believe
you'll be ready to challenge.

505
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,270
Five years?

506
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,850
You must be kidding.

507
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,510
Qiushui, stop messing around.

508
00:33:23,550 --> 00:33:24,380
Leave now.

509
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,480
We still have important matters
to discuss.

510
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,920
Reflect on the mistakes you made today.

511
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:29,790
-Let's go, Qiushui.
-Father.

512
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,590
-Qiushui.
-Leave now!

513
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,310
-Let's go.
-Mother.

514
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:32,310
Come on, get up.

515
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:35,030
Let's go.

516
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,110
We're leaving.

517
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,790
We'll talk about it later.

518
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:38,440
Uncle.

519
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,160
Let's go.

520
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:44,400
My unruly son has made a fool of himself.

521
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,240
Please, sit down.

522
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,790
Come on, please.

523
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:48,550
Please.

524
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:51,960
What's wrong?

525
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,580
Is your shoulder injured?

526
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,160
Mother, I'm fine.

527
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,440
Let me see.

528
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,400
Mother, it's really nothing.

529
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,920
Mother, I won't make you angry anymore.

530
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,800
I won't get into fights recklessly either.

531
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,480
Do you think I'm angry because you fought?

532
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,070
I'm angry because you were being reckless.

533
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:18,760
In the martial world, fighting is common.

534
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:21,250
But being reckless can cost you your life.

535
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,230
I want my son

536
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,440
to learn to say it hurts when he's injured

537
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,190
and learn to run when he can't win.

538
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,120
Don't try to be a hero, understand?

539
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,199
I'll remember that.

540
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,440
Don't worry.

541
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,489
I'm quick when it comes to
running for my life.

542
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,150
But I never thought

543
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,630
our Qiushui would have such ideas.

544
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,150
Although it's quite unrealistic,

545
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,840
I really like it.

546
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:50,760
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

547
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,760
I forgot.

548
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,610
Are you okay?

549
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:53,360
I'm okay.

550
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,960
You must be hungry.
I'll make you some noodles.

551
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:57,960
Wait here.

552
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,670
Mother.

553
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:12,320
I will definitely change
our Xiao family's fate.

554
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,630
When you were sick as a child,

555
00:35:25,630 --> 00:35:26,960
you loved this the most.

556
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:27,760
Eat up.

557
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,330
Mingming.

558
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,110
Here.

559
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:41,130
The noodles are ready.

560
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:19,560
What's wrong?

561
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,360
What's the matter, Qiushui?

562
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,730
Are my noodles that delicious?

563
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,740
It's just I haven't tasted this flavor
for too long.

564
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,710
Silly boy.

565
00:36:44,190 --> 00:36:46,520
Didn't I make this for you
just last month?

566
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,880
If you like it,

567
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,510
I'll make it

568
00:36:48,510 --> 00:36:49,630
for you every day.

569
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,380
Thank you, Mother.

570
00:36:57,710 --> 00:36:59,320
I've already instructed the kitchen staff.

571
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,190
Tonight, let's treat your friends

572
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,120
to a grand feast.

573
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:05,670
Alright.

574
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,590
You aim to be the young sect leader.

575
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:09,570
Come on, eat up.

576
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:11,880
I will.

577
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:27,090
This is indeed the Marching Pill.

578
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,200
After taking the Marching Pill,

579
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:36,440
one feels no hunger or thirst,
but becomes violent and frenzied.

580
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,140
More than a decade ago,

581
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:41,110
Baicao Valley created this pill.

582
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,710
They attempted to give it to
the Northern Wastelanders

583
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:45,170
to bring calamity to Daxi.

584
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,880
We righteous sects joined forces

585
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
to eliminate them

586
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,840
and destroyed all Marching Pills.

587
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,710
I never expected that
after all these years,

588
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,640
someone would create this thing again.

589
00:37:58,230 --> 00:38:00,280
It must be the remnants of Baicao Valley.

590
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,800
If the Northern Wasteland obtains
this evil thing again,

591
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,860
it will surely cause turmoil in Daxi.

592
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:06,920
I think

593
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:09,190
we should send some people

594
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,020
to investigate in Guangling.

595
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:14,320
I recall the Xiao family
has another residence in Guangling.

596
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,650
Please make plans immediately, Mr. Xiao.

597
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:20,730
I'll have things arranged tomorrow.

598
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:22,440
Big Brother, you've lost weight recently.

599
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,110
Aunt, please eat more.

600
00:38:23,110 --> 00:38:24,190
Do you know how long I've been waiting?

601
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:25,800
-Finally, this day has come.
-Here.

602
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:26,360
Thank you.

603
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,440
Then eat more.

604
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,560
You know what?

605
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,320
Especially this
sweet bamboo shoots with pork.

606
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
It's my favorite.

607
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:34,030
I think you're wrong about that.

608
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,270
Every dish Aunt makes

609
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,110
is something I've been longing for.

610
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,110
You're always such a sweet-talker.

611
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,590
Eat more.

612
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,110
Our Qiushui

613
00:38:42,150 --> 00:38:43,800
was raised strictly by his father.

614
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:44,590
I was worried

615
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,760
that he'd become timid and fearful.

616
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,960
Thankfully, he has good friends like you,

617
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,760
running wild together with him.

618
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,760
Here, I'd like to toast to you all.

619
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,190
-Cheers, Aunt.
-Cheers, Aunt.

620
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:56,710
Is "running wild" a compliment
or criticism?

621
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,030
That's just how our family talks.

622
00:38:58,030 --> 00:38:58,960
Come on, cheers.

623
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:00,440
-Cheers.
-Let's get hammered today.

624
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,100
Youth is meant for being wild.

625
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:12,480
Thanks.

626
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,410
Come on, Aunt, try some too.

627
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:16,630
I'll help myself.

628
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:20,070
Feng Lang, Mr. Feng.

629
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,590
I just heard from Iron-Clad Constable

630
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:24,920
that you've been a great help
to him this time.

631
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:25,830
Meeting you today,

632
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:27,590
you're truly
a fine and accomplished gentleman.

633
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,390
Come on, let me toast you as well.

634
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,940
Mrs. Xiao, you flatter me.

635
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:38,720
Rain Sword, your lightness skill
is exceptional.

636
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:41,690
You raced against a fine horse
for a day and night without losing.

637
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:43,150
That's how you became famous.

638
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:44,550
Mrs. Xiao, you're mistaken.

639
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,710
Jiangnan is rich in waters.

640
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:48,040
The thing I raced against
was a small boat.

641
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:54,800
Qiushui.

642
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:55,920
Look at me.

643
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:58,330
I'm getting old and my memory is failing.

644
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:01,670
So, Mr. Feng, what poison
were you struck with?

645
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,920
Mother, it was the Noxious Beetles.

646
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,590
The Noxious Beetles are truly rare.

647
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:12,190
I wonder

648
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,190
why the Power Gang

649
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:15,590
would poison you like this, Mr. Feng?

650
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,150
I told Xiao about this before.

651
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,220
I saw something I shouldn't have.

652
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,520
Have you heard about the massacre
at Changle Escort Agency?

653
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,960
It happened a few days ago.
Everyone in Jinzhong is talking about it.

654
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:44,020
I was there on the day of the massacre.

655
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,190
I was planning to hire
Changle Escort Agency for a job.

656
00:40:47,190 --> 00:40:50,230
But unexpectedly, I ran into Power Gang
committing the crime.

657
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,800
Although I managed to escape,

658
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,000
I was still poisoned.

659
00:40:54,070 --> 00:40:57,530
I heard Liu Suifeng from the Power Gang
was also there that day.

660
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,920
To survive an encounter with that villain

661
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:01,800
is truly remarkable, Mr. Feng.

662
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,400
Feng Lang.

663
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,840
What were you hiring
the Changle Escort Agency to transport?

664
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,440
The letter my master asked me to deliver
to Iron-Clad Constable.

665
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,780
I did escape by sheer luck,

666
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:21,630
but I think I heard

667
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:23,710
that the Power Gang's massacre

668
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,440
was to find someone important.

669
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,240
I wonder if any of you

670
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:29,450
have heard any rumors on the road.

671
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,280
I haven't heard anything about that.

672
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,920
The Changle Escort Agency is in Jinzhong.

673
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,650
Could that important person also
be in Jinzhong?

674
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Aunt, your Huanhua Sect
has extensive connections in Jinzhong.

675
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:41,840
Have you heard of

676
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,570
any important figures coming?

677
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:47,840
I haven't.

678
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,190
These trivial matters of the martial world
are such a mood killer.

679
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,670
Let's not talk about it today.

680
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:01,150
Today, let's just drink to
our heart's content!

681
00:42:01,150 --> 00:42:02,230
Right, drink to our heart's content.

682
00:42:02,230 --> 00:42:02,920
Drink to our heart's content.

683
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,960
Come on, let's drink to
our heart's content.

684
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,480
Cheers!

685
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,940
Come, let's drink up. Cheers!

686
00:42:07,030 --> 00:42:09,030
-Bottoms up.
-Cheers, Big Brother.

687
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:10,920
Thank you for your hospitality, Aunt!

688
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:11,840
Thanks for having us.
