[The Journey of Legend]

2
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,950
[Episode 5]

3
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,479
Third Young Master.

4
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:57,690
[Qianzhu Garden]

5
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:58,130
Third Young Master,
Master Xiao has ordered

6
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,330
that no one is to approach his quarters.

7
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,960
Since when have his quarters been
so heavily guarded?

8
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,040
If you have urgent matters,
I can inform him of your arrival.

9
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,840
Never mind. It's nothing urgent.

10
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,560
I just think you all look overworked.

11
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,910
Mother deliberately changed
the subject earlier,

12
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:42,370
and the quarters are
under such heavy guard.

13
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:45,430
Is that dignitary
really at the Xiao Residence?

14
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:54,920
Old Madam Wu!

15
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:58,810
Could Old Madam Wu be here
at the Xiao Residence?

16
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:01,200
I can't remember the specifics
of the plot,

17
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,000
but I seem to recall her having
the Hero Command Token...

18
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,060
That must be why she's being pursued.

19
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,360
So this is where we are in the story.

20
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,420
If that's the case,

21
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,030
the security might be enough
to keep me out,

22
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:15,430
but it won't hold back
a peak-level master.

23
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,630
I'd better have a contingency plan.

24
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,329
Come in.

25
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:31,760
Greetings, My Lord.

26
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,630
Did you find anything?

27
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,190
My Lord,

28
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,280
I haven't been with the Xiao family long,

29
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,750
so I can't move around freely.

30
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,520
But recently, they've added guards
near Xiao Xilou's quarters

31
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,750
at the Qianzhu Garden.

32
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,430
If they're hiding someone,

33
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,160
that's most likely where it is.

34
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,800
Qianzhu Garden

35
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,600
Sect Leader.

36
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,000
What's going on?

37
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,190
Why are all the lights suddenly lit?

38
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,960
It was the Third Young Master's order.

39
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,260
Where is he?

40
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,670
Father, Mother.

41
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:31,560
I did give the order.

42
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,080
Qiushui. This place...

43
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,159
is no venue for your nonsense.

44
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,360
That's right!

45
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,290
Mother. Father.

46
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,310
The martial world is
in turmoil these days.

47
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,750
Today I heard the Changle Escort Agency
met with trouble.

48
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,010
I am deeply concerned.

49
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,270
Adding more guards won't help much.

50
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,150
We should use these searchlights instead—

51
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,430
they guarantee complete coverage
with no blind spots.

52
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,159
What lights?

53
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,190
Permanent lights.

54
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,290
Only constant illumination
can prevent sneak attacks!

55
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,090
Sect Leader.

56
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,110
We had not

57
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:09,750
detected the wildcat
in the compound earlier,

58
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,480
but the Third Young Master's
permanent lights just scared it away.

59
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,770
Father.

60
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,530
See? I can be of some use after all.

61
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,680
Actually, competing with Yiren

62
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,310
for the Younger Leadership last time—

63
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:36,630
that wasn't really my intention...

64
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,250
I haven't punished you,

65
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,159
so don't push your luck.

66
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,270
Now, go.

67
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,159
You know
what you're supposed to do now, right?

68
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,480
Sleep!

69
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,290
That scared me to death!

70
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,159
I'm off to bed then.

71
00:05:56,159 --> 00:05:58,750
Father and Mother,
you should turn in early too.

72
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,210
This...

73
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,860
This child, you...

74
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,530
Old Madam Wu.

75
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:06,890
Let's go.

76
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,430
Guard this place.

77
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,560
Let no one pass.

78
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,070
Yes.

79
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,640
If Old Madam Wu is truly here,

80
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,630
it's only a matter of time
before trouble follows.

81
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,040
Enough overthinking.

82
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,900
I need to become the sect leader
as soon as possible.

83
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,680
You startled me!

84
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,850
Where are you off to?

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,400
Don't go running off now.

86
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,380
Just so you know, I'm not very familiar
with this place either.

87
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,010
Just taking a walk.

88
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:08,240
What? A walk?

89
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:11,560
What kind of walk is this
in the middle of the night?

90
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,490
Get inside, now.

91
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,830
Perfect timing, actually.

92
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,960
I need to talk to you.

93
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,760
Hurry up!

94
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,070
Come on, move! Get in!

95
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,600
These uncles refuse to recommend me.

96
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
I can't challenge Yiren
without their backing.

97
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,200
Hey, you! Give me some ideas—
and make it quick!

98
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,460
I've always wanted to ask:

99
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:50,180
why are you so desperate to become
the Huanhua Sect Leader?

100
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,040
Because...

101
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,390
If I don't become the sect leader,

102
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,240
there are things I cannot do,

103
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,620
and changes I cannot make.

104
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,070
Anyway, it's not something

105
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,730
I can explain to you right now.

106
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,870
But in this world,

107
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:11,870
the more desperate you are for something,
the more it eludes you.

108
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,270
If you won't help, fine.

109
00:08:13,270 --> 00:08:15,400
But why must you spread doom and gloom?

110
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:20,880
Look,

111
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,240
it's just the two of us here.

112
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,040
And you—drop the act.

113
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,520
Show me your secret weapon. Now.

114
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,800
Come on,

115
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,120
hurry up!

116
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,260
Secret weapon?

117
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,960
I don't have one.

118
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,900
Then... what about the martial arts?

119
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,070
You couldn't learn my martial arts anyway.

120
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,750
That's odd...

121
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,080
Aren't we friends already?

122
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,510
Don't you have anything to give me?

123
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,130
I have nothing to offer but myself.

124
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,870
Are you out of your mind?

125
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,600
Why are you being so sarcastic?

126
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,660
Let me ask you this:

127
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,270
once your injuries heal,

128
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,520
can you help me destroy the Power Gang?

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,240
How could I possibly
have that kind of power?

130
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,370
You must be kidding.

131
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,310
That's right.

132
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,240
I was just asking.

133
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:42,390
Perhaps we've just become friends,

134
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,740
and the Friendship Meter
isn't high enough yet.

135
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,360
Fine. Let's do this then.

136
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,020
What are you doing?

137
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,440
Mr. Feng, here's the thing.

138
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,500
I've never been one

139
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:20,600
for sleeping on the floor.

140
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,160
I hope you don't mind it too much.

141
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,200
Besides, something feels...

142
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:28,600
off between us.

143
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,500
But since we'll be stuck together
day and night,

144
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,810
let's just... not dwell on it.

145
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,160
Time to sleep.

146
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,730
It's getting late.

147
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,720
Oh, and blow out that candle, will you?

148
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:44,480
Alright.

149
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:51,140
This guy seems simple and gullible,

150
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:55,060
yet he keeps surprising me
with frustrating moves.

151
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:57,120
It seems like gaining his trust

152
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,360
won't be as easy as I thought.

153
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,050
Finally awake?

154
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:34,580
Here, have some breakfast.

155
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,640
No appetite.

156
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,970
No appetite? So you're skipping breakfast?

157
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,270
How odd!

158
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
Hey, why the rush?

159
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:52,390
I've got a question for you:

160
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:54,150
got any plans for today?

161
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,130
No plans. Just going out to clear my head.

162
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,120
Clear your head? Not a bad idea.

163
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,200
It might even help you
come up with a new plan.

164
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:09,290
Do you really want to
follow me around like this?

165
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,390
To be honest,
I don't really want to either.

166
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,190
But I truly have no other choice.

167
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:18,390
Fine. You need a recommendation
from a hero

168
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,270
to challenge Yiren. Is that it?

169
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,240
Exactly! I've told you all this.

170
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,900
Are you going to help me or not?

171
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,240
Kang Jiesheng, the son of Kang Chuyu.

172
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,930
What about this Kang Jiesheng?

173
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,600
Three years ago,

174
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,270
Kang Jiesheng was escorting
disaster relief supplies,

175
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,730
but gambled away
all the funds along the way.

176
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,500
This should have ruined his reputation,

177
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,040
yet he still poses as a young hero today.

178
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,860
Tell me, how is that possible?

179
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,700
So it was Uncle Kang
who covered it up for him.

180
00:12:59,080 --> 00:12:59,740
Brilliant.

181
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,550
Kang Chuyu dug into his own pockets

182
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,150
to cover the shortfall
and quell public anger.

183
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:08,630
It shows how deeply
he dotes on Kang Jiesheng.

184
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:11,000
So all you need to do
is get close to Kang Jiesheng,

185
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,730
and Kang Chuyu's letter of recommendation
will naturally follow.

186
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:18,630
Now that you say it,
it does sound like a solid plan.

187
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,200
Let's go.

188
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,060
Young Master Kang,

189
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,670
as I made clear before,

190
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,470
you and I are not kindred spirits.

191
00:13:32,470 --> 00:13:34,240
Please take these back.

192
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,610
Won't you take a closer look
inside the chest?

193
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,200
As the old saying goes,
"A fine blade suits a hero;

194
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,530
jewels befit a beauty."

195
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,360
This is but
a small token of my admiration.

196
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,960
If anything catches your eye,

197
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,960
you need only ask.

198
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,550
In time,
perhaps we may turn into kindred spirits.

199
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,030
True regard must spring
from a sincere heart.

200
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,290
If what you say is true,

201
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,960
then you demean

202
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,820
both others and yourself.

203
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:05,840
Xueyu, give me a chance
to get to know you better.

204
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,860
Young Master Kang,
please check your behavior.

205
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,270
Scum!

206
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:26,630
Xiao Xueyu,

207
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,200
you're merely an adopted daughter
of the Xiao family.

208
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,550
Who are you to act so aloof?

209
00:14:30,550 --> 00:14:32,360
I, Kang Jiesheng,

210
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,000
the sole heir of the Kang family,

211
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,600
have shown an interest in you.

212
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,400
You should consider it an honor.

213
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,990
What's with the pointing?

214
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:39,440
I—

215
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,870
Young Master Kang,
it seems to me you're severely injured.

216
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:44,470
Allow me to check your pulse.

217
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:48,970
What severe injury?

218
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,840
The skin on your face
is about to fall off.

219
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,200
That qualifies as a severe injury.

220
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,320
Or perhaps you've
simply decided to discard it.

221
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:55,840
Isn't that right, Xueyu?

222
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,240
You...

223
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:57,440
Alright.

224
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,720
It seems your father's lesson yesterday

225
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,960
wasn't enough.

226
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,910
"Mother,

227
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,290
I... I want to become
the young leader."

228
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,110
And you think you're worthy?

229
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,040
What now?

230
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:12,720
Are you asking for
another lesson in manners from me?

231
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,480
You have come to the Xiao family
and yet show no respect.

232
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,790
It seems someone like you
is just asking for a lesson.

233
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:19,720
-Qiushui!
-I...

234
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:24,840
Yiren.

235
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:25,910
Yiren.

236
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,420
Yiren, he's bullying me.

237
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,600
Mr. Xiao,
Qiushui is utterly disrespectful.

238
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,720
It's not Qiushui's fault.

239
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,440
About this matter...

240
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,570
I heard everything.

241
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,920
Young Master Kang,
Qiushui is reckless by nature.

242
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:44,370
I apologize on his behalf.

243
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:48,280
However, your words and actions
moments ago
were highly improper.

244
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,750
Xueyu grew up in the Xiao family.

245
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,510
We all regard her as one of our own.

246
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,970
Xueyu, Father always said

247
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,790
that a child's marriage
should be their own decision.

248
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,250
Therefore, your marriage

249
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,000
should also follow your heart.

250
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,750
No one can force you into anything.

251
00:16:07,630 --> 00:16:09,690
Did you hear that, Young Master Kang?

252
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,080
And you think
you're good enough for my sister?

253
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,940
Get that thought out of your head.

254
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,960
Why don't you
take a look at yourself in a puddle?

255
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,150
You wouldn't even get on the waiting list.

256
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,000
Xiao Qiushui, your words are too mean!

257
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,060
Young Master Kang,

258
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,840
morning tea is ready
in the front hall.

259
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,960
Uncle Kang is awaiting your presence.

260
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,090
Please do not delay.

261
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:30,960
Go, now!

262
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,120
Go!

263
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,000
Yiren, you know what?

264
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,550
That scumbag doesn't have
an honest bone in his body.

265
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:47,600
Alright, that's enough from you.

266
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,510
Of course, we are family.

267
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,490
It is my duty to protect you.

268
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,200
Besides, although the Kang family
is known for their chivalry,

269
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,080
Kang Jiesheng has a gambling problem.

270
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,750
An alliance through marriage with him

271
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,160
would likely tarnish the reputation
of our Huanhua Sect.

272
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,960
That's right.

273
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,589
Rest assured, Xueyu.

274
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:11,349
I will find you a match from a family

275
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:13,920
whose strength and honor
rival those of our Huanhua Sect.

276
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,380
Only such a worthy alliance
would befit you.

277
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,270
Thank you, Yiren.

278
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:21,310
But if I can stay by
Father and Mother's side for life,

279
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,710
roam the martial world and uphold justice,

280
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,310
I would be content.

281
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,720
I'll go prepare the herbal medicine now.

282
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,319
All right.

283
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,880
Yiren, there are many ways
to achieve mutual benefit.

284
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,900
But a lifelong commitment

285
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:41,240
should never be used as a bargaining chip.

286
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,100
I would never wrong my own sister.

287
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,550
If a marriage alliance
is to be considered,

288
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,410
it must be with someone she likes.

289
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,720
And another thing—

290
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,320
I haven't addressed you yet.

291
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,490
The Xiao family
has a reputation to uphold.

292
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,720
Even if you were in the right moments ago,

293
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,250
your lack of decorum
was still unacceptable.

294
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,030
Mother says you've shown
newfound ambition lately,

295
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:02,440
aspiring to compete for
the Young Leadership.

296
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,700
But do you know why no one recommends you?

297
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:09,200
You are still too young and impulsive.

298
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,400
Later, go have tea with Kang Jiesheng.

299
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,220
Consider it a gesture of reconciliation.

300
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:18,070
I'm not going.

301
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,510
Don't be stubborn. Go now.

302
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,690
Fine. I'll go along with it.

303
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,320
By offending Kang Jiesheng,

304
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,240
even if you go to offer him tea now,

305
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,440
it will be nearly impossible
to gain his recommendation.

306
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,040
Just because I've offended him

307
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,590
doesn't mean I'll fail.

308
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,400
Since I've already offended him,

309
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,060
I might as well finish the job.

310
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:01,350
Besides, I still have you to help me.

311
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:11,680
You want to gamble with Kang Jiesheng?

312
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,480
Exactly!

313
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:15,920
Since he bullied Xueyu,

314
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,000
I have to make him pay dearly for it.

315
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:21,830
Mr. Feng,

316
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,020
lend me your priceless treasure,

317
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,200
the Hanhao Stone.

318
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,590
This time,
I'm going to make a serious bet with him.

319
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:37,550
Mr. Xiao, this stone of mine is
exceptionally rare in this world.

320
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,310
The blade wielded by Hero Kang Chuyu

321
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:43,310
was forged with this very material.

322
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,410
It is a key reason he can unleash
the "Sun-Gazing Sword Technique".

323
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,800
It took me immense effort

324
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,870
to obtain just this small piece.

325
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,030
Great!

326
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,880
Now hand it over.

327
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,230
Come on, I need to borrow it!

328
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:17,710
Mr. Feng, no need to be so stingy.

329
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,070
That's not how a true friend acts.

330
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:26,000
I'm not that stingy, really...

331
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:32,880
Hand it over.

332
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,680
Mr. Feng.

333
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,750
Mr. Feng, set your mind at rest.

334
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:43,080
If I win this time,
I will repay you double.

335
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,450
My goodness!

336
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,340
This truly is a remarkable stone!

337
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:54,680
Without this stone, Kang Jiesheng

338
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,920
has never been able to unleash
the technique his father taught him.

339
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,030
Set your mind at ease.

340
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,630
He will desperately want it.

341
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,830
This time, I'm going to
make him pay through the nose.

342
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,360
I'll clean him out for good.

343
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,070
Since it's a gamble,

344
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:07,930
how can you be so sure he won't win?

345
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,110
These dice are loaded with mercury.

346
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,470
They'll land on whatever number I want.

347
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,750
This time, he won't stand a chance.

348
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:32,520
Do you think this paltry stuff is enough
to bet against my Hanhao Stone?

349
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,350
But this is gold!

350
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:37,640
Gold? So what?

351
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,440
You think I've never seen gold before?

352
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,120
It doesn't even
compare to my Hanhao Stone.

353
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:45,070
Let's go. The game's off!

354
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,000
Then what do you want?

355
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,910
That thumb ring on your hand
looks rather fine.

356
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,550
Add it to the pot, and we have a bet.

357
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,550
Xiao Qiushui,

358
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,590
this is a treasured heirloom
of the Kang family,

359
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:10,270
and also the Young Leadership Token
of the Kang family.

360
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,470
Treasured heirloom?

361
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,680
So what if it's your treasured heirloom?

362
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,080
This Hanhao Stone of mine

363
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,370
is one of a kind in the entire world.

364
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,550
Enough. Do we have a bet or not?

365
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,000
If not, forget it.
Enough with the nonsense.

366
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,200
Let's go. Break it up.

367
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:21,750
Fine!

368
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:28,910
Let's do this!

369
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,000
High roll.

370
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,070
One round.

371
00:22:42,590 --> 00:22:44,750
A single round settles it all.

372
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:20,150
Double sixes! Boxcars! Twelve!

373
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,070
Twelve!

374
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,680
Twelve. Your turn.

375
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:28,880
Not bad at all.

376
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,250
The dice are hot for you today.

377
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:37,350
Also twelve!

378
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,070
The Third Young Master is incredible!

379
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,270
I have twelve as well!

380
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:43,310
Xiao Qiushui,

381
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,070
do you acknowledge

382
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,400
the rules of gambling
in the martial world?

383
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,060
Of course I acknowledge them.

384
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,460
It's good that you acknowledge them.

385
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,270
Cheating incurs a tenfold penalty.

386
00:23:58,310 --> 00:24:01,480
And your dice... are loaded with mercury.

387
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,510
How could this be?

388
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:11,000
No mercury! None at all!

389
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,860
Where is it?

390
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,990
Where's the mercury?

391
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,680
Exactly! Nothing here!

392
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,610
No mercury here! Where would it be?

393
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,400
What did you say just now?

394
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,480
A tenfold penalty for cheating?

395
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,750
Third Young Master won!
Kang Jiesheng totally cheated!

396
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:36,680
How is this possible? Impossible!

397
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,510
How dare he frame our Third Young Master?

398
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,640
This is outrageous!

399
00:24:40,110 --> 00:24:41,370
Pay a tenfold penalty!

400
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,270
Cheating?

401
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,570
You should have your tendons severed.

402
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,160
A pity... I find it too dirty for me.

403
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,160
Mr. Feng, let's split the winnings.

404
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,000
Wait!

405
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,030
When did you switch my dice?

406
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,540
But you just said...

407
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,870
Alright, you two!

408
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:04,510
You actually set me up and played me!

409
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,550
Right, it's time to eat.

410
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,530
Let's call it.

411
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:09,130
The game is over.

412
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,130
-Yes, Young Master.
-Xiao Qiushui.

413
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,230
After all this,

414
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,320
isn't it just for Xiao Xueyu?

415
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,340
After all you've done for her,

416
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:27,480
could it be... you've been having
a secret affair all along?

417
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:31,360
What is he talking about?
He's just rattled because he lost!

418
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,070
I knew it!

419
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,290
No wonder she refused to marry me.

420
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,110
So this is why—

421
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40,440
there's been something going on
between you two all along!

422
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,540
My Young Leadership Token...

423
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:54,760
In this world,

424
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:59,070
some are born under a lucky star.

425
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,810
They have
all they desire without striving,

426
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:06,000
and stand high without ever working.

427
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,640
In time,

428
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,490
they truly believe
they can look down on others.

429
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,640
Today, I'm telling you—

430
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,590
that doesn't work on me.

431
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:27,750
Xiao Qiushui,
it seems you have a death wish.

432
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:28,520
Jieshen.

433
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,260
Father! Yiren!

434
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,000
Father!

435
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:46,270
Xiao Qiushui destroyed my thumb ring,
the Young Leadership Token!

436
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,070
I saw everything! You... you...

437
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,800
humiliated me beyond words!

438
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:51,480
I told you to have tea
with Young Master Kang!

439
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,540
How did you end up in a gambling match?

440
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,920
Return every coin you took!

441
00:26:58,310 --> 00:26:59,910
I... I didn't take anything!

442
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:01,590
Chuyu...

443
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,930
You don't have to... Just keep it.

444
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,610
Apologize to Uncle Kang right now!

445
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,560
Uncle Kang, my discourtesy as your junior.

446
00:27:18,830 --> 00:27:20,690
My apologies. Please forgive me.

447
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,830
The thanks should be mine.

448
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,510
Jiesheng usually

449
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:26,100
keeps too many bad influences around.

450
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,900
I wish to see him make friends

451
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:30,030
with sincere ones like Third Young Master,

452
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,240
who can wake him up.

453
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,970
This matter is over and done with.

454
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,310
After lunch, all the Xiaos gather here.

455
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:43,000
I have a matter of importance to announce.
Dismissed.

456
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,400
Yes.

457
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,400
Chuyu, I apologize for any offense.

458
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,000
Thank you.

459
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,800
Safe travels.

460
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:49,750
Let's go.

461
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:56,600
Let's go.

462
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,320
Did I say you could leave?

463
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,920
Not you.

464
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,130
You—get over here.

465
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,200
Father, I was wrong.

466
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:16,790
Are you trying to hit your father?

467
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:18,750
No! I wouldn't dare!

468
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:24,950
You... you're always causing trouble
and truly deserve punishment.

469
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,510
But that fine speech of yours

470
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,480
was rather pleasing to hear.

471
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,490
Remember—don't get cocky.

472
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,790
I'll hold off on the penalty.

473
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,270
Don't repeat this!

474
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:41,960
Yes.

475
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,400
By doing this,
Uncle Kang will probably

476
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,590
give me that
letter of recommendation, right?

477
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:58,070
Anyway, I'm doing it.

478
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,970
Kang Chuyu actually wrote you
that letter of recommendation.

479
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,000
Years ago,

480
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,400
Uncle Kang covered up his son's scandal,

481
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,150
embezzlement of charity funds,

482
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,880
while condoning his gambling.

483
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,110
Today's cover-up

484
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,570
follows the same logic.

485
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,960
The more Kang Jiesheng disgraced himself,

486
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,680
the more Uncle Kang
must maintain a generous facade.

487
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,280
However unwilling at heart,

488
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,170
he's compelled to grant it.

489
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,200
After today,

490
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,610
both father and son
must hold a grudge against me.

491
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,770
We've truly forged bad blood.

492
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,000
You know quite a lot, don't you?

493
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,720
It's all about social nuances, after all.

494
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,320
The first lesson in a career.

495
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:44,640
Career?

496
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:49,750
See? Our first collaboration

497
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,310
got us this recommendation letter.

498
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:55,350
This should strengthen our friendship,

499
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,240
so my settings can restore faster.

500
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,210
Alright,

501
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:00,510
enough talk for now.

502
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,880
I'm going to find my father.

503
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,350
You—don't wander off.

504
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,070
The Huanhua Sect is gathered here today

505
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:22,110
for 2 announcements.

506
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,550
First:

507
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,480
recent traces of Marching Pills

508
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,350
were found in Guangling.

509
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,580
Marching Pill?

510
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,830
Wasn't the Baicao Valley

511
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,360
wiped out over a decade ago?

512
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,270
How could there be
surviving Marching Pills?

513
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,400
This is suspicious—

514
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:42,100
hence all righteous sects
in the martial world are sending envoys

515
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:43,770
to investigate in Guangling.

516
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:47,110
Our Huanhua Sect
must take responsibility, too.

517
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,640
Yiren,

518
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,880
tomorrow you will take Kaiyan

519
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:53,830
and lead the Tiger Guards with Shinian

520
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,750
to Guangling Villa.

521
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:59,800
Investigate the truth
of the Marching Pills.

522
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,350
Yes.

523
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,030
Father, I wish to go
with Yiren and Kaiyan.

524
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:08,350
Having grown up immersed
in the Huanhua Sect,

525
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:10,720
I aspire to become a hero
like you and Mother,

526
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,830
and make contributions
to the martial world.

527
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,830
Now that my skills have progressed,

528
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,000
and I excel in the Healing Arts.

529
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,920
I can be of help.

530
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:23,160
Does your mother agree with this?

531
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,480
It would be good to gain more experience.

532
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,000
Great!

533
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,690
With your mother's approval,

534
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,030
I consent.

535
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,290
So—

536
00:31:39,910 --> 00:31:41,510
once the supplies are ready,

537
00:31:41,790 --> 00:31:44,750
you may set out for Guangling
with your brothers.

538
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:46,330
Thank you, Father.

539
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,880
The second announcement

540
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,380
is about family business.

541
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:58,110
I am now in my 50s

542
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:02,240
and have led the Huanhua Sect
for many years.

543
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:04,200
In recent years,

544
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,350
Yiren has assisted greatly,

545
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,050
and wishes to

546
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,440
take full charge
of Guangling Villa for me.

547
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,050
I originally intended

548
00:32:13,050 --> 00:32:15,580
to hold the ceremony in 6 days,

549
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:17,640
but since you must depart,

550
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,750
we will advance the date—

551
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:22,720
and pass the Young Leadership position
to you.

552
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:26,960
Yiren.

553
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:29,110
Yes.

554
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,350
This is the Huanhua Sect Leader's Token—

555
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,270
from this day forth, you will be...

556
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:37,830
Wait!

557
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,030
Father, this is the recommendation letter
from Uncle Kang.

558
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,750
I wish to compete fairly
for the Young Leadership.

559
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,680
It's upside down.

560
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,450
You're holding it upside down!

561
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:08,670
Sorry, Father.

562
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:10,850
Please have a look.

563
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,980
Just check it, Father.

564
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:13,640
Mother!

565
00:33:14,030 --> 00:33:14,920
Just take a look, won't you?

566
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,450
What's the harm in looking?

567
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,590
See? It's really a recommendation letter
from Kang Chuyu!

568
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,390
It's genuine!

569
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,410
Well, go on and examine it
with your son, then.

570
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:31,200
Qiushui,

571
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,640
I dare not even compete with Yiren.

572
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,240
Where did you get such nerve?

573
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:37,790
Qiushui,

574
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,240
now that you have
Uncle Kang's recommendation,

575
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,440
it proves that our Xiao family

576
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,170
has gained another young hero.

577
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,260
This makes me glad.

578
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,400
When you are ready,

579
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:48,440
feel free to challenge me anytime.

580
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,450
Yiren.

581
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,240
Qiushui,

582
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,640
all these years,

583
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:54,030
Yiren has fulfilled
the duties of the Young Leadership.

584
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,250
If you are serious about this,

585
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,210
you should first gain a few more

586
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:57,880
years of experience in the martial world.

587
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,810
you may properly challenge Yiren.

588
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,830
Mother, I really can't wait!

589
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,830
I don't have the time.

590
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:03,630
-Qiushui.
-I…

591
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:06,110
You're still so young!

592
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,840
How could you not have the time?

593
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,040
Yiren, could you temporarily
pass the role to me for a year?

594
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,550
If not a year, even half a year would do.

595
00:34:14,550 --> 00:34:16,670
I will definitely return
the Young Leadership to you.

596
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:17,230
Could you?

597
00:34:17,230 --> 00:34:17,800
Qiushui,

598
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:19,350
the Young Leadership

599
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,520
cannot be passed around like a toy.

600
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,670
I thought you were
finally seeking progress,

601
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,280
but you treat it as a game.

602
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,480
Then I cannot tolerate this.

603
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,250
Enough! Stop messing around.

604
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,600
Do not disappoint me.

605
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,960
Yiren, I'm not messing around!

606
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,030
This concerns every life

607
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,159
in the Huanhua Sect!

608
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:39,679
Yiren!

609
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:40,400
What?

610
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,440
Yiren!

611
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:46,150
Father, Mother,

612
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:47,670
then by the rules—

613
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,480
I accept the challenge!

614
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:54,920
Very well.

615
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,710
Since you have the recommendation,

616
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,970
we must honor your request.

617
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,150
Good!

618
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:03,230
Before Yiren departs,

619
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,330
we shall arrange a duel
between the two of you.

620
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,480
Agreed?

621
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:09,710
Yes.

622
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,550
Naturally, it's a good thing

623
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:16,100
that Qiushui shows such determination.

624
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:16,950
Prepare well.

625
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:21,960
Yiren, go and prepare
the supplies quickly.

626
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:25,630
Yes.

627
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,560
Let's go.

628
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:37,760
Qiushui, are you really
going through with this duel?

629
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,020
Qiushui, this still doesn't seem right.

630
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:41,470
Yiren is highly skilled—

631
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,070
you'll only make a fool of yourself
against him.

632
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,110
Let me talk to Father again,

633
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,040
and have him drop the matter.

634
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,110
Kaiyan, thank you for your concern.

635
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:56,400
I do have reasons beyond my control.

636
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,890
There's no need to worry about me.

637
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:01,270
If I look like a fool, so be it.

638
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,220
I'm not afraid.

639
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,840
Qiushui speaks wisely.

640
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,430
Since he has decided,

641
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,440
let him try.

642
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,800
Even if he is embarrassed,

643
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,130
he will have no regrets.

644
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:10,850
Kaiyan, set your mind at rest—

645
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,460
Yiren won't hurt Qiushui.

646
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,550
Come, train with me.

647
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,330
Mother, where are we going?

648
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,760
No peeking, both of you!

649
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,680
Let's go!

650
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,360
The tea today is quite good.

651
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:29,960
Yes, it is.

652
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,740
Why are you here alone?

653
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,190
My Lord, all servants
hired in the past 3 years

654
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,670
were dismissed
by the Xiao family before noon.

655
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:40,070
I can only stay until dusk
for the handover.

656
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,550
Lately,

657
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:47,210
that Xiao Qiushui has been keeping me
completely occupied.

658
00:36:47,510 --> 00:36:49,030
I was just about to request all of you—

659
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,960
why were you all suddenly dismissed?

660
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,000
I've no idea, either.

661
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,880
The order was given by Third Young Master.

662
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,540
But My Lord,

663
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,960
after you went to investigate
the Qianzhu Garden,

664
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,360
the Xiao family sent a palanquin...

665
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,630
to the Sword Manor.

666
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,050
Did you see who was inside it?

667
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:02,650
I did not.

668
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,280
You will soon face Yiren in the duel.

669
00:37:07,510 --> 00:37:09,070
I am so worried about you.

670
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,360
Mother, do you also think
I'll definitely lose?

671
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:13,880
Yes.

672
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:17,190
So I have decided—

673
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:21,630
I will pass my best skills on to you.

674
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,960
Mother, you must be joking!

675
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,230
Your best skill is the Cross Wisdom Sword—

676
00:37:29,230 --> 00:37:30,840
I cannot master that in a single day!

677
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,110
Of course not!

678
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:35,030
The Cross Wisdom Sword is
a public-facing skill.

679
00:37:35,030 --> 00:37:36,920
Before I met your father,

680
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,070
I relied on my true best skill—

681
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,210
in duels, I was never truly defeated,

682
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,050
but I did not always win either.

683
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,030
Never lost—

684
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,280
but neither won nor lost?

685
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:50,010
What kind of skill is that?

686
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
Watch me closely!

687
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,190
First move: Pheasant Ascends to Roof—

688
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,720
use this when you are ambushed
on flat ground.

689
00:38:13,590 --> 00:38:14,360
This—

690
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,880
is the second move.

691
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,590
The third move is crucial.

692
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:34,760
Xilou?

693
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,000
Mother, what is that smell?

694
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,880
What underhanded tricks are you using?

695
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,670
Correct!
This is the Three Styles of Boldness.

696
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,510
Back in the day,

697
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,630
with these three moves,

698
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,280
even when I couldn't win,

699
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,120
I could retreat unscathed.

700
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,960
If not for your father—

701
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,070
insisting on being a righteous hero,

702
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,840
forbidding me to use this style—

703
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,570
it would have been
perfected and expanded by now.

704
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:12,970
Remember that?

705
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:13,850
I remember.

706
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:16,110
Mom, these moves are really bold.

707
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,150
I know Yiren well.

708
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,880
Though usually reasonable,

709
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:31,190
his reputation is very important to him.

710
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,790
I know you have clever ideas,

711
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,350
but still be careful—

712
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:35,800
I don't want

713
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,840
my youngest son
to get wounded by the eldest,

714
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,970
leaving me with nowhere to turn to cry!

715
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,540
Please set your mind at ease, Mother.

716
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:43,920
Do your best!

717
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,590
Remember!

718
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,550
If you cannot win, yield—

719
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:51,210
never push yourself too hard.

720
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:00,900
[Xiao's Sword Manor]

721
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,430
It's so heavily guarded—

722
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,300
seems it's here after all.

723
00:40:11,590 --> 00:40:13,840
Xiao Qiushui caused
that scene the other day,

724
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,500
making Xiao Xilou so vigilant

725
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,710
that he sent Old Madam Wu
to the Sword Manor overnight.

726
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,170
Such a troublesome place!

727
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,030
All that effort to push Xiao Qiushui

728
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,890
into a duel and carve out this time

729
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:25,000
was for nothing.

730
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,520
Greetings, Mr. Xiao and Mrs. Xiao.

731
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,150
Let's begin.

732
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,720
I did not expect you to be ready so soon.

733
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:38,710
Then today, I will face you in the duel.

734
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,880
Yiren, I have a proposal.

735
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,480
As we are family,

736
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,480
crossing blades with real weapons

737
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,610
is not quite proper.

738
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,920
How about replacing 1 major duel
with 3 smaller matches?

739
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,920
What do you think?

740
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,280
How will these smaller matches work?

741
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,140
Internal energy, lightness skill,
and precision.

742
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,960
Good, then have it your way.

743
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,320
Yiren, for the first round,

744
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,160
let's see which of us

745
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,800
can attract more iron rods wins.

746
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:29,670
Qiushui, you challenge Yiren
directly in internal energy—

747
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:31,270
something so solid and real.

748
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,660
What trick are you up to this time?

749
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,280
Sure, as you wish.

750
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,550
Truly impressive!

751
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,440
Now, my turn.
