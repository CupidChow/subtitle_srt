[Episode 13]

3
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,880
Are you a human or a ghost?

4
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,870
Why do you look so familiar?

5
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,870
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

6
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,290
Don't go.

7
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,350
[Du Yueshan, Mengxiang Sect Leader]

8
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,430
Well, is he dead or alive?

9
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,430
Hold on.

10
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:29,560
Be careful!

11
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,280
Finally, some meat to eat!

12
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,560
Big chunks of meat.

13
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,520
Fresh meat!

14
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:58,920
Old monster,

15
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,360
we haven't bathed for three months.

16
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,310
Our meat will taste sour.

17
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,310
Not edible at all.

18
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,510
T-This crazy old man.

19
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,940
Is he one of Qu Hanshan's men?

20
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:05,780
Good.

21
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,470
Unwashed men taste even better!

22
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,030
The Sword King has blocked the entrance.

23
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,960
And we can't get out of here either.

24
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,030
Looks like
he also fell victim to Qu Hanshan.

25
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,150
Sir,

26
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,010
you were also imprisoned here
by Qu Hanshan, right?

27
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,570
Why don't we join hands to escape?

28
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,079
Escape?

29
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,190
No!

30
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,470
I want meat now.

31
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,560
I haven't had meat for a long time!

32
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,360
Dodge!

33
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,310
Tang Fang!

34
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:55,470
Finally, I can eat some meat.

35
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,140
[Du Yueshan]

36
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:11,630
Let me go!

37
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,470
Mengxiang Sect Leader, Du Yueshan?

38
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,240
Can't believe this crazy old man

39
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,070
is one of the Three Peaks
along with Qu Hanshan and Gu Junshan,

40
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,560
the renowned Du Yueshan!

41
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,120
How did this legendary Du Yueshan

42
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:24,840
end up here

43
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,680
and go mad?

44
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,120
I see.

45
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,630
He seems to have been poisoned
by the Power Gang's Dead-Bat Venom,

46
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,230
which made him lose his mind.

47
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,830
Strike his Jingmen

48
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,510
and Baihui acupoints

49
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,200
to vent his internal energy,

50
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,360
and he can recover.

51
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,240
But given his insanity
and formidable martial arts,

52
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,570
it's hard to pull it off!

53
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,280
One-on-one won't work.

54
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,090
But now there are four of us.

55
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,480
I want meat!

56
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,360
I got it.

57
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,510
I want meat right now!

58
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:55,430
Come on, old freak! Come on!

59
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,680
Eat me! Come on!

60
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,270
I'll tear you all apart!

61
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,310
I taste good! Come eat me!

62
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:00,950
Old freak!

63
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:20,390
Sir.

64
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,160
Sir?

65
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,600
Mr. Du?

66
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,190
The poison has dissipated
with his internal energy.

67
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,520
He should recover soon.

68
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:36,760
Oh, no.

69
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,040
Someone's setting fire outside.

70
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,040
No wonder I smell burnt pig hair.

71
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,750
What now?

72
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,630
Xiao Qiushui!

73
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,070
Either you come out,

74
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,600
or you suffocate from the smoke.

75
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,870
Take your pick.

76
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:50,680
Fan faster.

77
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,360
Yes!

78
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,070
We have no other choice now.

79
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,070
Let's go that way.

80
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,750
Wait,

81
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,170
what about this crazy old man?

82
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,100
Take him with us.

83
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,320
Be careful. Let's go.

84
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,040
Okay, move.

85
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,530
Take it slow. Good. Keep going.

86
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:25,240
How's it?

87
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,190
Any way out?

88
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,980
It's a dead end.

89
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,690
Up ahead is a stone wall.
We can't get through.

90
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:36,070
-Help Mr. Du sit down.
-Come on.

91
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:46,120
There's a waterfall
cascading from above

92
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,310
nonstop. It must be
an ever-flowing stream.

93
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,070
There might be a way out below.

94
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,270
But...

95
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,590
Things are critical. We can't linger here.

96
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,540
Looks like we have to explore
the bottom of the pond.

97
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,560
What should we do?

98
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,120
-He's come around!
-You...

99
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:10,780
He's awake!

100
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,950
What's wrong with you again?

101
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,610
You guys...

102
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,870
Who exactly are you?

103
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,800
I am Tang Fang from the Tang Sect.

104
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
These are Tie Xingyue and Qiu Nangu.

105
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:26,630
Sir, this is your personal token,
isn't it?

106
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,630
Indeed. I am Du Yueshan.

107
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:36,159
Are you really Mr. Du?

108
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,180
How did you end up here?

109
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,430
It's all
because of that old scoundrel Qu Hanshan!

110
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,159
He tricked me into coming here for a duel,

111
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:46,240
yet imprisoned me
with the Dragon-Binding Rope for years

112
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,210
in order to force me to hand over
the Mengxiang Sword Technique.

113
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,050
How despicable Qu Hanshan is!

114
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,159
Unbelievable!

115
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:56,159
Sir, I am Xiao Qiushui.
I just drained your internal energy.

116
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,000
Sorry for the offense.

117
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,800
Never mind.

118
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,160
Were it not for you,

119
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,310
the Dead-Bat Venom

120
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,840
would eventually cause me
to explode and die.

121
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,270
By the way,

122
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,950
how did you young ones

123
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:11,600
end up being cornered here by Qu Hanshan?

124
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,120
It's a long story.

125
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,630
I've figured out Qu Hanshan's identity
as the Sword King.

126
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,430
He wants to kill me to silence me.

127
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,660
More importantly,

128
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,400
he's going all out to stop me

129
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:27,270
from returning
to the Xiao Residence of Huanhua Sect

130
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,000
to save my parents from danger.

131
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:33,090
Huanhua Sect? You're from the Xiao family
of Huanhua Sect?

132
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,070
That's right.

133
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,450
Then you'd better stay inside.

134
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,150
Better to be caught by Qu Hanshan

135
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,270
than end up in Liu Suifeng's hands.

136
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,440
Sir,

137
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,530
what do you mean by that?

138
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Don't you know?

139
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,300
Liu Suifeng of the Power Gang

140
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,500
has a vendetta against the Xiao family.

141
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,870
Liu Suifeng wants to wipe out
the Xiao family.

142
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,930
He definitely won't spare your life.

143
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,770
Liu Suifeng has a vendetta
against the Xiao family?

144
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,630
No way.

145
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,210
I don't believe there's any vendetta.

146
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,330
And be it the Power Gang or Liu Suifeng,

147
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,150
I won't let any of them go!

148
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,750
Our priority now

149
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,360
is to find a way out.

150
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:24,470
That's right.

151
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,600
We need to find a way to get out first.

152
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,030
This pond seems to have flowing water.

153
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:29,360
It must lead somewhere.

154
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:30,960
Sir,

155
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,360
having been locked up here for so long,

156
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,440
do you know what's beneath this pond?

157
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:37,450
Brilliant,

158
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:42,320
you're quite a perceptive young hero.

159
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,360
I do know something about it.

160
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,680
Let me point you in the right direction.

161
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,190
You're a clever one.

162
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,810
You were right earlier.

163
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,080
There's a crack

164
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,080
down there,

165
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,140
but it's too narrow
for a person to pass through.

166
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,150
After years of being trapped here,

167
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,670
meditating every day,

168
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:04,080
I finally figured out a solution
to this predicament.

169
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,240
My Mengxiang Sword Technique

170
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,000
includes a move
that can manipulate water with a sword.

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,390
That is to wield a sword
to concentrate the power of water currents

172
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,840
and break open a way out.

173
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,550
-That's great!
-Nice!

174
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:16,720
Sir, please use it right away

175
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,980
-and take us out.
-Yes!

176
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:18,960
But sir,

177
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,000
you've lost your internal energy.

178
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,910
So you can't perform your sword technique.

179
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,120
It's okay.

180
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,600
I can teach my Mengxiang Sword Technique

181
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,320
to one of you.

182
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,760
As long as you grasp its essence,

183
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,250
even with quick learning,

184
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,080
it will still work for sure.

185
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,100
My hidden weapon skills are
totally different from sword skills.

186
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:45,480
It's on you.

187
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,510
S-Sir, how about me?

188
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:48,960
My master died early,

189
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,360
so I wouldn't mind becoming your disciple.

190
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,150
Sir, look how tall, robust,

191
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:53,080
and mighty I am.

192
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:53,840
You?

193
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:55,870
And you?

194
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,550
No, no, no.

195
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,120
You can't do this either.

196
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,510
Didn't you say you could do it?

197
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,200
Why do you think I can't do this?

198
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,440
He's blind to talent.

199
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,320
I'm so awesome.

200
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,520
-You're no better than me.
-Fine, fine.

201
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,920
Your aptitude seems quite good.

202
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,720
I wonder
if your comprehension is up to par.

203
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,080
Well then,

204
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,750
how about
I teach my Mengxiang Sword Technique

205
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:30,510
to you?

206
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,510
Sir, please don't joke about this.

207
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,640
That's impossible.

208
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:36,030
Sir,

209
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,120
whether we can get out of here
all depends on you!

210
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,670
That's right.
None of us knows how to use a sword.

211
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:40,790
We're counting on you.

212
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,390
I...

213
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,390
I...

214
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,150
-Come on! Learn swordmanship from me.
-Wait, no.

215
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:45,870
Let's go.

216
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,440
Fan faster. Faster!

217
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:53,750
Suffocate them with smoke!

218
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:54,200
Yes.

219
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,960
Liu Suifeng,

220
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:06,120
First, you trespassed into
my Guangling territory,

221
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,270
and now you even dare
meddle in my household affairs.

222
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:09,120
Sword King.

223
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,030
Why the hostility?

224
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,130
Xiao Qiushui has tricked both you and me.

225
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,150
Cunning and treacherous as he is,

226
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,390
if pushed too far,

227
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,390
he'd rather destroy everything

228
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:22,390
than let anyone gain any advantage.

229
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,150
I suggest you take a step back

230
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:27,750
and see how he struggles next.

231
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,410
He already knows my identity.

232
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,320
I absolutely can't
let him survive out there.

233
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,320
With your status
in the Guangling martial community,

234
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,510
isn't it an easy thing to twist the truth?

235
00:13:39,630 --> 00:13:41,150
Don't waste time on him.

236
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:44,910
The Hero Command Token is
what matters most now.

237
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,650
You know the whereabouts
of the Hero Command Token?

238
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,260
I've investigated it.

239
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,770
There are only two possibilities
for the Token's location.

240
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,180
It's either at the Xiao Residence

241
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,830
or on Xiao Qiushui.

242
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,120
With the one on Xiao Qiushui proven fake,

243
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:08,420
the real one must be
at the Xiao Residence.

244
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,440
Sword King,

245
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:13,320
why don't we join hands

246
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,000
to find that Hero Command Token?

247
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,240
Deputy Chief Liu,
you've always been high and mighty,

248
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,300
yet now you want to cooperate with me?

249
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,890
I have no choice.

250
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,870
The Xiao's Sword Manor is rigged
with self-destruct mechanisms.

251
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,070
If we force our way in,

252
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,380
fire bombs will destroy everything.

253
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,570
To get the intact Hero Command Token,

254
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,510
we can only break in from the inside.

255
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,040
I've already been exposed,

256
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,360
but you still stand a chance, Sword King.

257
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,840
If we break into the Sword Manor,

258
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,080
I'll be able to find Xiao Xilou
and have my revenge.

259
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,150
And I'm willing

260
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,510
to share this credit with you.

261
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,150
You want me to go help the Xiao family?

262
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,210
Given your reputation in Guangling,

263
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,080
Xiao Yiren will surely come
to ask you for help.

264
00:14:59,080 --> 00:14:59,960
If I were you,

265
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,960
I would agree to help him

266
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,520
and infiltrate the Sword Manor.

267
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:06,840
But if I let Xiao Qiushui survive,

268
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,240
things might go sideways
and ruin my plans.

269
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,760
Rest assured, Sword King.

270
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,200
I know him well.

271
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,120
He poses no threat.

272
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,800
Have you mastered it?

273
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:25,600
Be careful.

274
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,120
W-Will he be alright?

275
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,550
This sword skill is extremely draining.

276
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,210
If he runs out of strength now,

277
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,080
the current could very likely
carry him away.

278
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,320
Qiushui!

279
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,600
Qiushui!

280
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:17,870
It's simple.

281
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,650
I won't let him go back.

282
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,040
I've got something up my sleeve.

283
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:28,750
Dealing with Xiao Qiushui is
nothing hard for me.

284
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:32,910
Then you can do whatever you want

285
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:34,320
with him.

286
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,150
Just keep him alive so that I can
have my revenge.

287
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,730
Killing two birds with one stone.

288
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:50,000
Deputy Chief Liu,
you sure are good at plotting.

289
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,200
Qiushui! Qiushui!

290
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,240
Qiushui!

291
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,200
How's it? Did you break through it?

292
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:07,440
Yes, I did it!

293
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,310
Great!

294
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,160
Excellent! We made it!

295
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,589
They're coming after us! There!

296
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,660
No time to waste. Jump!

297
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,720
Go! Let's go!

298
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,270
Master.

299
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,720
Xiao Qiushui and the others
escaped through the waterway.

300
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,850
Also, Xiao Yiren and his men are
already at our doorstep.

301
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,010
They came at the perfect time.

302
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:46,060
Shinian, don't be rude.
Stand down immediately.

303
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,630
Mr. Qu.

304
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:56,000
You Huanhua Sect members keep coming
to my residence to pick fights.

305
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,260
Are you openly declaring war against me?

306
00:17:58,590 --> 00:17:59,400
Mr. Qu,

307
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,880
I, Xiao Yiren,
along with my younger brother, Kaiyan,

308
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,440
came here to pay our respects.

309
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,790
We've long heard of your prestige
as He Who Shakes Guangling.

310
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,520
We wouldn't dare to offend you.

311
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:08,720
We're here today

312
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,480
because of the Power Gang's siege
of the Xiao Residence.

313
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,740
Mr. Qu, we hope that you

314
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,150
can help us seek justice.

315
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:18,230
Xiao Qiushui just barged into my mansion
with a crew of hooligans

316
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,710
to mess around and ruin my reputation.

317
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:24,110
And now you're here
to force me to help the Xiao family.

318
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,990
What are you up to?

319
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,200
Qiushui?

320
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:33,660
Mr. Qu,

321
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,350
perhaps
there's been some misunderstanding.

322
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,640
Now, your brother

323
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,790
is calling me
the Sword King of the Power Gang.

324
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:42,830
He's slandered everyone at my residence
as Power Gang members

325
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,240
and threatened to announce this
to the entire martial world

326
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,920
to ruin my reputation.

327
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,660
So I'm sorry. There's nothing

328
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,600
I can do to help the Xiaos
out of the trouble.

329
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,360
-Mr. Qu. Mr. Qu.
-Enough.

330
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,680
Your brother, Xiao Qiushui,
calls us the Power Gang,

331
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,310
but I think the people around him
are more like it.

332
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,640
He's so skilled in framing.

333
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,200
If not properly disciplined,

334
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,640
he'll not only
ruin your family's reputation

335
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,970
but also tend to become a menace
to the entire martial world.

336
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:17,680
Yiren,

337
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,480
did they get it wrong?

338
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,200
How could Qiushui
possibly do such a thing?

339
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,130
Qiushui usually

340
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,680
does hang out with some shady folks

341
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,590
and behave a bit inappropriately,

342
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:29,120
but he wouldn't go this far.

343
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,570
Could it be
that he's fallen for some villain's lies?

344
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,580
How about this?

345
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,590
I'll head back immediately
to investigate this matter.

346
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,750
You go to the Divine Blade Hall
to visit Master Ge.

347
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,310
Okay.

348
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,440
We've been walking for so long.

349
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,960
Where are we going?

350
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,110
Mr. Du,

351
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,960
this place is too treacherous to linger.

352
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,790
We'll walk a few more miles
to the dock and take a boat.

353
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:00,050
Then we'll reach
the Huanhua Sect's Guangling Villa soon.

354
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,840
We're going to your home?

355
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,400
My sister is skilled in medicine.

356
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
Mr. Du, you have internal injuries.

357
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,590
I believe my sister can heal you.

358
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,880
After you recover,

359
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:13,010
I'll have someone
escort you back to the Mengxiang Sect.

360
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:16,270
I was harmed by that villain Qu

361
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,160
and imprisoned for years,

362
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,590
with half my cultivation gone.

363
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:22,440
It's already a great stigma.

364
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,880
And now you're exposing my miserable state

365
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,970
to more people,

366
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:29,950
to the entire martial world!

367
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,000
I'd rather die right here.

368
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:34,960
I won't go.

369
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:35,790
Mr. Du,

370
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,310
please calm down.

371
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,880
It's just that your internal injuries...

372
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:44,440
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.
I'm leaving.

373
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,700
How about this, Mr. Du?

374
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:50,750
I happen to have some silver nuggets here.

375
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
Take some for your travel expenses.

376
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,040
Thank you, young man. Farewell.

377
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,030
-Sir.
-Sir!

378
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,130
Bro, well...

379
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,680
I still have some silver here.

380
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,280
Take it with you,

381
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,960
find a proper job,

382
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,400
and never join the Power Gang.

383
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,030
We don't want money.

384
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:25,430
That's not what we meant.

385
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,240
Sir,

386
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:28,920
we brothers have been
in the martial world for years

387
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,720
and seen assorted shady people.

388
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,550
But we've never met a hero like you
who's so keen to help

389
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:34,920
and do good deeds.

390
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,200
We want to follow you.

391
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:36,640
Yes.

392
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,230
Instead of joining some third-rate sect,

393
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,770
we'd rather be disciples
of the Huanhua Sect.

394
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,110
Wait, but...

395
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,200
Sir, you're not despising us, are you?

396
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,350
Well,

397
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,750
it seems that someone
with unorthodox training like us

398
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:54,720
can only join

399
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,830
those evil sects.

400
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,720
Well, if we can't join the Power Gang,

401
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,640
then let's try the Twelve Serial Docks.

402
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,640
Take care, both of you.

403
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,050
Hold on.

404
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:18,680
I'm not despising you.

405
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,590
It's just that joining the Xiao family is
quite complicated.

406
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,880
And it's not just up to me.

407
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,960
If you don't mind,

408
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,540
you could join
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

409
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,730
Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood?

410
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,260
It has "zhou" (state) in its name.

411
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,570
Sounds like a great sect, doesn't it?

412
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,400
Yes.

413
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:44,710
Is it even more powerful
than the Huanhua Sect?

414
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,720
As long as you have

415
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:49,590
a righteous and chivalrous heart,
regardless of background,

416
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,270
everyone in Shenzhou
calls each other brother.

417
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:58,040
A brotherhood that values
chivalry and loyalty!

418
00:22:58,550 --> 00:23:01,510
Then we're willing to join
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood!

419
00:23:01,510 --> 00:23:03,750
From now on, we'll follow you, sir.

420
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,880
No need for that formality.

421
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,620
From now on,
we'll call each other brothers.

422
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:11,640
Good!

423
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:12,920
Great!

424
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,080
You not only saved our lives

425
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,830
but also let us join
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

426
00:23:16,830 --> 00:23:18,400
From now on, we'll follow your lead only!

427
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,730
You're our big brother.

428
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,290
Hello, Big Brother.

429
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,440
-Big Brother!
-Big Brother!

430
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,500
Don't call me that.

431
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,820
We'll venture through
the martial world together.

432
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,640
Your Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood
has such a random recruitment,

433
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,640
letting just any "stray cats" join.

434
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,200
I'd like to see

435
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:36,140
when trouble comes,

436
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,440
if they'll scatter
like rats from a sinking ship.

437
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,720
What's with all this talk
of cats and rats?

438
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,680
Which one of us looks like that?

439
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,960
Are you so fond of animals?

440
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,720
We definitely won't scatter like rats.

441
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,310
Exactly.

442
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,720
No, wait.

443
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,240
She's insulting us.

444
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,030
Not again!

445
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,550
Alright, let's go.

446
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,440
This is a bit over the top.

447
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,900
She really holds a grudge.

448
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,430
[Xiao Residence]

449
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,050
I should write a notice,

450
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,270
exposing all the dirty deeds
that old scoundrel,

451
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,470
Qu Hanshan, has done.

452
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,070
The so-called "He Who Shakes Guangling"?

453
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:09,640
Bah!

454
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,550
Right, we need to reveal it to the world.

455
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:13,200
-Indeed!
-Call all martial artists

456
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,070
to avenge the Free-Spirited Sage's death.

457
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:15,680
Exactly.

458
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,550
And we need to let the Power Gang know

459
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,510
that recruiting Qu Hanshan, but not us,

460
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,110
is one of their biggest losses.

461
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:21,590
Yes!

462
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,850
You really want to join the Power Gang?

463
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:25,260
I once considered it.

464
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:25,950
No, no.

465
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:26,520
Qiushui.

466
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:30,320
Qiushui.

467
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,000
Yiren.

468
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,330
Shinian.

469
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,960
What does this mean?

470
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,510
Yiren,

471
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:42,980
what are you doing?

472
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:44,440
They're all my friends.

473
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,680
What friends?

474
00:24:47,030 --> 00:24:48,960
Friends who want to join the Power Gang?

475
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,440
Our Huanhua Sect is now besieged
by the Power Gang.

476
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:52,960
Mother and Father are struggling
to defend the Sword Manor.

477
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,420
Aren't you worried at all?

478
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,550
Yet you're making friends with these guys!

479
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,280
Yiren, you really got me wrong.

480
00:24:58,310 --> 00:25:00,000
They are Tie Xingyue, Qiu Nangu,

481
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,060
and Miss Tang Fang from the Tang Sect.

482
00:25:02,110 --> 00:25:04,000
If they hadn't escorted me all the way,

483
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,720
I couldn't have made it back here.

484
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,520
The Tang Sect?

485
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:09,200
I'm Tang Fang from the Tang Sect.

486
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,400
Greetings, Mr. Xiao.

487
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,750
We two don't have such official tokens.

488
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:18,030
But here are our names of integrity.

489
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,570
Tie Xingyue, the Fart King of Wujiangdu.

490
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,290
Qiu Nangu, the Iron Mouth.

491
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,280
I've never heard of the sect

492
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,200
called Wujiangdu.

493
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,650
It doesn't matter.

494
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,270
We've both joined

495
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,400
Big Brother's Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

496
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,930
We're a great brotherhood.

497
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:36,760
We don't care about backgrounds,
only chivalry.

498
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,400
Yiren,

499
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,060
they truly are my sworn brothers.

500
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,070
Were it not for them and Miss Tang
risking their lives to help me,

501
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:44,550
I couldn't have escaped

502
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,610
from the Sword King of the Power Gang.

503
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,920
Are you
talking about Mr. Qu, Qu Hanshan?

504
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,000
That's right.

505
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,240
Qu Hanshan has been pretending
to be a heroic master for decades.

506
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,930
-He actually...
-Shut up!

507
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,240
As He Who Shakes Guangling, Mr. Qu

508
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,400
has incredible prestige.

509
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,330
How dare you slander him like this?

510
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:05,720
I haven't properly questioned you
about this matter yet!

511
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:08,070
Shinian, take good care of Miss Tang.

512
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,790
As for these other disreputable scums,

513
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,030
there's no need to invite them in.

514
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,830
Wait a minute.

515
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,800
Did he just insult us?

516
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:18,030
He called us disreputable scums!

517
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:19,030
You...

518
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:22,030
You are our big brother's eldest brother,

519
00:26:22,030 --> 00:26:23,640
but you still can't speak to us so rudely.

520
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:26,110
We two also have our pride!

521
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,800
Drive these two out of here now!

522
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:36,380
Who do you think you are?

523
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,070
If we're not welcome here,
we'll find somewhere else to go.

524
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:41,870
That's right.

525
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:43,470
Let's go have dinner.

526
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,920
Take care, Big Brother!

527
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:49,590
Let's go.

528
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,160
Yiren,

529
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,750
Qu Hanshan was framing me.

530
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:56,160
His mansion is the den of the Power Gang.

531
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,720
That's enough! Stop it!

532
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,310
Do you really want to force me
to discipline you with the punishing rod?

533
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:01,920
Yiren.

534
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,200
Xueyu.

535
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
Please calm down.

536
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,550
Qiushui, you must be tired
from your long journey.

537
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,590
Stay calm

538
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,600
and take your time to tell Yiren
what happened.

539
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,200
Okay.

540
00:27:13,550 --> 00:27:15,000
Xueyu, you know

541
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,640
the request for help is
of great importance now.

542
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,170
But he's talking nonsense,

543
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,440
antagonizing everyone.

544
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,200
He's pushing our Xiao family into danger!

545
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,790
It's exactly
because this matter is so important

546
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:28,070
that I believe Qiushui
wouldn't speak recklessly,

547
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:30,030
nor would he mess
with something this serious.

548
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,690
Yiren, I'm telling the truth.

549
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,130
Qu Hanshan is framing me like this

550
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,160
just in order to hide his true identity.

551
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:41,160
Mr. Gu Junshan discovered

552
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,030
the flaw in Kang Chuyu,
the Nameless Demon,

553
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,720
so Qu Hanshan killed him on the spot.

554
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,500
The Free-Spirited Sage?

555
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,400
You mean Qu Hanshan is
from the Power Gang,

556
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:53,170
and Kang Chuyu is the Nameless Demon?

557
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,850
If what you say is true,

558
00:27:55,270 --> 00:27:58,070
they've been hiding perfectly
all these years.

559
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,640
Even if the others in the martial world
heard about this,

560
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,200
they would never believe it.

561
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,750
Yiren, this is true.

562
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:05,310
If you don't believe me,

563
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:06,680
Miss Tang and Zuoqiu can testify.

564
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,480
That's right!

565
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,640
Yuhan, the others, and I can all testify.

566
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,700
We all witnessed it with our own eyes.

567
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,250
Kang Chuyu killed Tang Rou!

568
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,170
Kang Chuyu was someone

569
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,460
who watched us grow up.

570
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,800
Yet he did such a shady thing.

571
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,200
He truly betrayed our parents' trust.

572
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:25,110
Yiren, Kaiyan,

573
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,240
why aren't you surprised at all?

574
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,110
About Kang...

575
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:32,880
About Kang Chuyu's matter.

576
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:35,720
Qu Hanshan has already explained it.

577
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:37,160
Mr. Qu discovered that

578
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,750
Kang Chuyu was the Nameless Demon
from the Power Gang.

579
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,750
He managed to lure him
to his residence for arrest,

580
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,240
but your brother came out of nowhere

581
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,240
and screwed it up.

582
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,160
Not only did the suspect escape,

583
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,690
but he was also besmirched.

584
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,680
That's impossible.

585
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,550
Do you think
I can't tell right from wrong?

586
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:54,400
Alright,

587
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,110
I'll believe you
in Kang Chuyu's matter for now.

588
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,240
But Mr. Qu has been holding sway
over Guangling for over three decades.

589
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,920
People have always spoken highly of him.

590
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:02,450
Besides,

591
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,510
he was just trying to capture Kang Chuyu.

592
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:06,270
How could he possibly be
one of the Power Gang?

593
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:09,130
I think your lack
of experience in the martial world

594
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:10,480
made you act recklessly

595
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,940
before things were clear,

596
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:14,750
resulting in this misunderstanding
with Mr. Qu.

597
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,310
Yiren,

598
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,090
it's really not a misunderstanding.

599
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,160
We saw it with our own eyes.

600
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,110
Qu Hanshan has deceived you.

601
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:25,550
I can testify too.

602
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,000
Everything Xiao Qiushui said is true.

603
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:31,790
Kang Chuyu and Qu Hanshan were in cahoots.

604
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:32,640
Miss Tang,

605
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:35,550
your Tang Sect
and our Xiao family are both in Jinzhong.

606
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:37,200
But when the Sword Manor is under siege,

607
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,360
has your Tang Sect offered any help?

608
00:29:40,350 --> 00:29:41,810
Your Tang Sect's attitude

609
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:44,180
has already
disappointed our family deeply.

610
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,600
How can I believe your testimony now?

611
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,340
The Tang Sect is one thing,

612
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,380
and Miss Tang is another.

613
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,520
You can't mix them together.

614
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,830
Even Rou

615
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,570
died trying to save me.

616
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,550
Yiren, your words

617
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,680
truly disappoint me.

618
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,760
Young Master! Young Master!

619
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,540
There's a letter from Qu Hanshan.

620
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:27,400
[Challenge Letter]

621
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,110
It's a challenge letter from Qu Hanshan,

622
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,920
saying that you, Qiushui,
are slandering him.

623
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,350
He wants to prove his innocence.

624
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:43,440
Otherwise, his standing
in the martial world will be ruined.

625
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,180
So he wants you

626
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,160
to face him in a duel
at his mansion tomorrow

627
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,480
to prove his innocence.

628
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:48,540
Qiushui cannot go.

629
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,200
If he goes, I'm afraid

630
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,460
he'll face a disaster.

631
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Not to mention the gap in martial arts,

632
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,750
if Qiushui shows up for the fight,

633
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,160
he'll be positioned against
the entire Guangling martial community.

634
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,890
Don't worry.

635
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,440
If someone has to go,

636
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,570
I'll go in his place.

637
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,720
But once we accept the challenge,

638
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,920
the consequences will be devastating.

639
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,660
Not only will Qiushui
become everyone's enemy,

640
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,200
but the Xiao family will also be isolated
without support.

641
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:12,790
Yiren,

642
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:15,480
don't you understand even now?

643
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,120
Qu Hanshan plans to kill and silence me.

644
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,330
But none of this matters right now.

645
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:21,640
The first priority is

646
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:24,070
to figure out
how to rescue Father and Mother

647
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:25,730
and keep the Sword Manor safe.

648
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:27,470
So Yiren, Kaiyan, Xueyu,

649
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:29,880
we need to come up
with a plan immediately

650
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,070
to help the Sword Manor out of danger
in the fastest way.

651
00:31:32,070 --> 00:31:33,640
Having offended Mr. Qu,
you're going against

652
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,240
the martial community in Guangling.

653
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,970
Who else
would help the Sword Manor at this point?

654
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,700
If that's the case,

655
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:43,870
we should leave Guangling right away

656
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:47,030
and go to Shaolin, Wudang,
or the other sects in Wubei.

657
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,160
I believe with our parents' reputation
in the martial world,

658
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,790
among their numerous friends,

659
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,830
there must be someone
who will come to our aid.

660
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,090
Easier said than done.

661
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,920
Guangling and Wubei have always been

662
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,650
allies through thick and thin.

663
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,830
It's not as easy

664
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,200
as your armchair strategies.

665
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,960
Sort out your own affairs first!

666
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:04,510
Yiren!

667
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,720
Qiushui,
the innocent will be proven innocent.

668
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,650
No more arguing.

669
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,480
The truth will come to light one day.

670
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:12,720
Mr. Xiao...

671
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,090
Enough, Miss Tang.

672
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,790
This is our family affair.

673
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:17,790
The Tang Sect should not interfere.

674
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:20,950
Qiushui, stay at home and behave yourself.

675
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,900
Don't cause any more trouble.

676
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:23,560
Shinian!

677
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,400
Yes!

678
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,070
Yiren.

679
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,680
Before we get to the bottom of it,

680
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,340
don't let the Third Young Master
leave his room.

681
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:30,320
Understood.

682
00:32:47,550 --> 00:32:48,110
How's it?

683
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,500
The Baizhan Sect, Pili Hall,
and Xiaoyao Sect all claim

684
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,430
that their Sect Leaders are away.

685
00:32:56,430 --> 00:32:57,630
There's no response.

686
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,160
We did meet with Master Ge
from the Divine Blade Hall,

687
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,880
but he said

688
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:04,410
that if we couldn't clear up
the misunderstanding with Mr. Qu,

689
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,560
he wouldn't help us.

690
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:10,240
Is there not a single person
willing to step forward?

691
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:13,270
The two biggest shots
in Guangling right now

692
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,690
are Mr. Qu and Mr. Liang.

693
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,510
But Mr. Liang has no fixed abode

694
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:18,850
and is hard to find.

695
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:22,420
All 16 major sects
follow Qu Hanshan's lead.

696
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:24,160
Without his authorization,

697
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,760
no one dares to agree to help.

698
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:27,780
Let's not rush.

699
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:29,920
Hope the Bishan Sect

700
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,600
can show some kindness to our Xiao family.

701
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,680
Young Master, Miss Weng is here.

702
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,590
-Miss Weng.
-Greetings, Miss Weng.

703
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,150
This way, please.

704
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:41,610
Please.

705
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:48,230
Miss Weng, is everything going

706
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,000
smoothly?

707
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:51,720
Our sect leader had agreed to help.

708
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,880
But who knew your brother, Xiao Qiushui,

709
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,880
would end up
holding such a serious grudge with Mr. Qu?

710
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,680
Even if my sect fellows won't come,

711
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,480
I will still do my utmost to help.

712
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,210
But my strength alone is limited,

713
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,840
so I can hardly help you turn the tables.

714
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:12,480
And I'm curious how Qiushui is so sure

715
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,810
that Mr. Qu is the Sword King
of the Power Gang.

716
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,480
Qiushui said that yesterday
at Qu's residence,

717
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,880
he heard Mr. Qu admit
to being the Sword King

718
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,610
and saw him kill Mr. Gu Junshan.

719
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,480
How is that possible?

720
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:27,159
Isn't Gu Junshan still alive and well?

721
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,630
What?

722
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,800
Today they just had a discussion
with my sect leader.

723
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,480
I saw them off in person.

724
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,219
Greetings, Miss Weng.

725
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:45,320
Xiaoyi.

726
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,960
I found something.

727
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,000
Tie Xingyue and Qiu Nangu,

728
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,150
who followed Qiushui earlier,

729
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:52,000
used to keep talking about
joining the Power Gang

730
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,530
when they were in Jinzhong.

731
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,610
And they have close ties
with the Burrow Demon

732
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,739
from the Power Gang.

733
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,010
Could these two really be members
of the Power Gang,

734
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:06,840
deliberately staying by Qiushui's side
to mislead him?

735
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,320
Seems like Mr. Qu was telling the truth.

736
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,360
Qiushui was deceived by some villains

737
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,360
and failed to tell right from wrong.

738
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,000
It's too early to draw conclusions now.

739
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,500
Qiushui might have fallen into a trap

740
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,040
and didn't mean to do it.

741
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:26,940
What matters most now

742
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:29,490
is to prevent things from getting worse.

743
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:31,510
We must resolve

744
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,920
the conflict with Mr. Qu.

745
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,530
The key is to seek help from Guangling.

746
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:37,450
We cannot make the Xiao family

747
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,800
antagonize everyone at this moment.

748
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,670
But now Mr. Qu insists on a duel
to the death.

749
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,890
How can we remedy this?

750
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,280
Years ago,

751
00:35:49,550 --> 00:35:51,110
Mr. Qu and I caught a spy

752
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:52,920
from the Northern Wasteland together.

753
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,580
We built some rapport
during that cooperation.

754
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,280
How about I go try to mediate?

755
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:00,150
If he relents,

756
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:04,610
there's still room for negotiation
regarding the aid to the Sword Manor.

757
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,000
Thank you so much, Miss Weng.

758
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,280
Liang, please take Miss Weng to rest.

759
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,760
This way, please.

760
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,590
Kaiyan,

761
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:20,280
then we should go
apologize to Mr. Qu as soon as possible.

762
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:21,840
Yiren,

763
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,960
don't you find this matter fishy?

764
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:28,630
Qiushui always likes to fool around.

765
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,230
He does act weirdly at times.

766
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,490
But he's always been vigilant.

767
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:35,800
I never expected him
to be so easily deceived by someone.

768
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,800
We can't blame it all on Qiushui.

769
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,480
After all,
the Power Gang came well-prepared.

770
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,940
They're just too cunning.

771
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,990
Let's go to Qu's Mansion first
to take a look.

772
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,440
Let's do our best
to resolve the conflict with Mr. Qu.

773
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,040
If what Qiushui said is true,

774
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:52,150
then he'll certainly
give himself away at some point.

775
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,150
Miss Tang.

776
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:13,070
Miss Tang,
without the Young Master's permission,

777
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,880
you can't go in
to see the Third Young Master.

778
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,360
I just want to go in and talk to him.

779
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:17,230
Why can't I?

780
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,000
Qiushui, this door is heavily guarded.

781
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:25,590
I'll figure out another way later.

782
00:37:25,590 --> 00:37:26,360
See you soon.

783
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,460
[Weng Yueying lied that Free-Spirited Sage
had been to the Bishan Sect.]

784
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,860
[Xiao Yiren trusts her and is going
to seek peace with Qu Hanshan.]

785
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:53,710
Could it be that even Miss Weng is
a member of the Power Gang?

786
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:55,840
Qu Hanshan is unbelievably powerful.

787
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:57,800
No,

788
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,170
I can't sit back and do nothing.

789
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:05,200
Let me go.

790
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,340
I need to see Yiren.

791
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,070
Without the Young Leader's order,

792
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,280
we can't let you out.

793
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,320
Please don't make things hard for us.

794
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:13,850
Make way!

795
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,230
Stop.

796
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,180
Xueyu, are you here to let me out?

797
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,060
Without Yiren's permission,

798
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,110
Shinian won't let you leave.

799
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,280
Xueyu,

800
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,510
the news
about the Free-Spirited Sage is fake.

801
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,760
I saw him killed
by Qu Hanshan with my own eyes.

802
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,760
If Miss Weng wasn't being deceived,

803
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,090
then she must be one of the Power Gang.

804
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,480
Qiushui, we don't have any other evidence

805
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:43,750
to convince Yiren.

806
00:38:43,830 --> 00:38:46,160
And the others won't believe what you say.

807
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,640
If you're right,

808
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,440
and even Miss Weng from Bishan Sect

809
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,040
is also one of the Power Gang,

810
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,960
then I'm afraid there's no one left

811
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,220
in the entire martial world we can trust.

812
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,630
Anyway, Xueyu, you can't trust anyone

813
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,320
working with Qu Hanshan.

814
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,710
I won't go into details now.

815
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:02,920
I need to hurry and stop Yiren.

816
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,360
Qiushui, listen to me.

817
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,480
Everyone in Guangling and Wubei
has rejected our request for help.

818
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,940
If you go now,
aren't you walking into a trap?

819
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:09,870
So, Xueyu,

820
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,760
you don't believe me either?

821
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,090
Of course I believe you.

822
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,030
You've been strong-minded since childhood.

823
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,320
Although I can't fully understand

824
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,500
what you mean most of the time,

825
00:39:21,530 --> 00:39:23,550
I know how treacherous
people in the martial world are.

826
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:26,440
Despite Yiren's years of experience
in the martial world,

827
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,100
he can still misjudge people.

828
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:28,910
So, Xueyu,

829
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,940
we must stop Yiren

830
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,720
before he falls into the enemy's trap.

831
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,070
I see, Qiushui.

832
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,190
Calm down.

833
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,340
I'll go talk to Yiren again

834
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,670
and talk things over with him.

835
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,190
Okay.

836
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,800
Never thought
that Qu Hanshan would strike first.

837
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,600
That's crazy.

838
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,890
Now that I'm confined here,

839
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:55,000
how can I be his match?

840
00:39:56,390 --> 00:39:58,790
No, I can't think this way.

841
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,420
No matter how powerful he is,
he can also slip up.

842
00:40:02,550 --> 00:40:04,440
I need to try to get
the Sect Leader's Token from Yiren.

843
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,970
And it might give me a chance

844
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:08,110
to rewrite the story

845
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:11,890
and get rid of the Sword King
and the Power Gang.

846
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,630
Master.

847
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:40,410
Xiao Yiren is waiting outside
and insists on seeing you.

848
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,680
Liu Suifeng is indeed a great schemer.

849
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,340
Xiao Yiren really

850
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,230
came to beg for my help again.

851
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:50,710
The Xiaos

852
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:53,840
always disguise themselves
under the name of chivalry.

853
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:58,650
Let's use this to deliver
the final fatal blow to Xiao Qiushui.

854
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:14,760
Did it go well?

855
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:16,360
How's it? What did Mr. Qu say?

856
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,320
Things didn't go smoothly at first.

857
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,670
But after Yiren's heartfelt persuasion,

858
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:24,350
Mr. Qu finally decided to gather
the sixteen sects

859
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:28,080
tomorrow at Top Fairness Forest
to discuss aiding the Sword Manor.

860
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:29,200
That's great.

861
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:31,210
Are you sure he's trustworthy?

862
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:34,430
I watched him closely for a long time

863
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,640
and didn't notice anything wrong.

864
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,340
He should be trustworthy.

865
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:41,970
But now Mr. Qu is determined

866
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,150
to have Qiushui
apologize to him in person.

867
00:41:44,150 --> 00:41:45,880
It seems that he won't easily let go

868
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,610
of the smear on his reputation.

869
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,550
Will he make things difficult for Qiushui?

870
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,460
At this point,

871
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,800
Qiushui will have to bear with it.

872
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,860
Never mind. Let it be a lesson for him.

873
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,740
Besides, Mr. Qu is
a highly esteemed figure.

874
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,600
In front of all the sect leaders,

875
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,410
he won't go too far, I think.

876
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,510
Okay.

877
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,960
Then tomorrow, you and Kaiyan

878
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,880
escort Qiushui to Top Fairness Forest.

879
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,510
I'll continue organizing the aid

880
00:42:11,510 --> 00:42:13,360
and make all necessary arrangements.

881
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:14,760
Once the matter
at Top Fairness Forest is settled,

882
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,440
we'll immediately join forces
and head back for reinforcements.

883
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,770
Yiren, please make sure
you protect Qiushui well tomorrow.

884
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:22,510
Rest assured.

885
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,110
Yiren and Kaiyang will both be there.

886
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:25,710
They'll definitely keep Qiushui safe.

887
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:26,910
Don't worry too much.

888
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,100
[Sect Leader's Token]

889
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,280
The Sect Leader's Token?

890
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:36,090
He wants us to steal
the Sect Leader's Token?

891
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,150
That's ridiculous!

892
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:42,920
What does Qiushui
want the Sect Leader's Token for?

893
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,920
He didn't tell me.

894
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,320
Although he usually acts wild and unruly,

895
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,540
seeming unreliable,

896
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,600
he always knows what he's doing.

897
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,040
He must have his reasons for doing this.

898
00:42:53,230 --> 00:42:53,920
I agree.

899
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:55,440
Being predictable

00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,710
isn't Big Brother's style.

901
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:58,550
I'll continue to support him this time.

902
00:42:58,550 --> 00:42:59,320
Of course!

903
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:01,000
Big Brother trusts us so much.

904
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,280
We definitely won't let him down.
