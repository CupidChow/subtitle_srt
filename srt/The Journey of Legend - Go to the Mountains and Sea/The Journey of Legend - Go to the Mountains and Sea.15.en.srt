[The Journey of Legend]

2
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:43,890
[Episode 15]

3
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,590
Son.

4
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:02,040
Forgive me for only being able

5
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,080
to tell you the truth in this way.

6
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,830
Your father and I lied to you.

7
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,910
Actually, Sword Manor doesn't have
much water left.

8
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,540
After discussing with your uncles,

9
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,150
we decided

10
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,370
to leave the opportunity
to you young people.

11
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:35,870
My son...

12
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,610
I'm afraid
I won't live to see your return.

13
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:43,550
I only hope you can successfully

14
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,530
find your brothers and sister,

15
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,840
and the four of you
can live well from now on.

16
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,079
In time,

17
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:55,910
you'll surely become
the pillar of the Xiao family.

18
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,520
Your father and I, in spirit,

19
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,840
will be proud of you.

20
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,600
Oh, by the way,

21
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,500
let me tell you something in secret.

22
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,110
Don't tell Yiren and Kaiyan about this.

23
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,280
Actually,

24
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,960
you're the most handsome son in my heart.

25
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:33,840
Mother, Sun Huishan.

26
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,210
Final words.

27
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:48,460
[Sword Manor won't last much longer.]

28
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:00,310
[The water supply there is insufficient.]

29
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,430
[The Power Gang outside Sword Manor
is watching like hawks,]

30
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,560
[surrounding them without retreat.]

31
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,260
When I see Yiren and Kaiyan,

32
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,860
I need to tell them.

33
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,920
It's too late.

34
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:17,579
What should I do?

35
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,510
Yiren!

36
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,390
Yiren!

37
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,159
Yiren, Kaiyan, Xueyu.

38
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:40,310
Hurry back and save our parents.

39
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,190
Sword Manor is running out of water.

40
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,560
Father and Mother...

41
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,159
They can't wait any longer.

42
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:53,250
Why would Mother write such a letter?

43
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,570
Could it be that they...

44
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,730
We'll set out immediately

45
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,150
and travel day and night.

46
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,880
We'll definitely make it back
to Sword Manor in time.

47
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,740
Xueyu is right.

48
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,190
Mr. Qu

49
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,710
has gathered the righteous warriors
of Guangling.

50
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:10,710
Once we join forces,

51
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:12,240
we'll set off immediately.

52
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,920
Yiren.

53
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,830
That'll be too late.

54
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,310
We really can't delay any longer.

55
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:25,720
Qu Hanshan will never help us.

56
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,920
If you don't go now,

57
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,560
Father and Mother...

58
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,560
They'll really die.

59
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,159
Shut up!

60
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,110
How could you speak
such discouraging words?

61
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,800
The martial world of Guangling
has promised to come to Sword Manor's aid.

62
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,060
Why do you still refuse to believe Mr. Qu?

63
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,720
I'm really not making this up.

64
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,800
I truly know

65
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,270
the plot and events of the future!

66
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,600
[Warning]

67
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,400
Qiushui, what nonsense
are you talking about?

68
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,240
[You've violated the character settings
by revealing plot details.]

69
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,750
[The Boiling Blood Cocoon punishment
will begin shortly.]

70
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:10,410
[Health points decreasing.]

71
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,950
Suppose... Just suppose

72
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,600
I somehow ended up in this storybook.

73
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:37,230
I could know the ending of
the entire story,

74
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,630
and I could know everything.

75
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:41,640
Saying it like this,

76
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,010
do you understand now?

77
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,830
Qiushui, what on earth
are you talking about?

78
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,190
I'm really not making this up.

79
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,560
I just want to save Father and Mother.

80
00:06:59,240 --> 00:06:59,750
Enough!

81
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,810
I taught you everything you know.

82
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,270
I've always hoped
you'd grow up quickly,

83
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:06,190
so one day you could support me

84
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:07,320
and the Xiao family.

85
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:08,490
But what about you?

86
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,080
Look at what you've been doing and saying!

87
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,750
Yiren.

88
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,750
Yiren!

89
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,930
-Yiren!
-Yiren!

90
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,630
Yiren!

91
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,870
-Qiushui!
-Yiren!

92
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:19,070
-Qiushui!
-Qiushui.

93
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,650
Come on.

94
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,190
Yiren, don't bring Qu Hanshan back
to Sword Manor under any circumstances.

95
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,560
I swear on my life—

96
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,540
he's the Sword King of the Power Gang.

97
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:43,770
When you meet with him,

98
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,670
take him to Top Fairness Forest.

99
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:48,190
By then,

100
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,400
I'll definitely prove it to you.

101
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,830
Yiren, please.

102
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,270
I'm begging you.

103
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:00,830
Yiren.

104
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,040
Qiushui wouldn't joke about

105
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,170
our parents' lives.

106
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,070
If Qu Hanshan is truly reliable,

107
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:07,930
why fear putting him to this test?

108
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,120
Yiren.

109
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,440
Yiren, Qiushui has never begged anyone
like this before.

110
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,290
We've worked so hard

111
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,000
to gain Guangling's support.

112
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,360
Yiren.

113
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,190
This time,

114
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,000
if I cannot prove

115
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,860
that Qu Hanshan is the Sword King,

116
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,840
I'll atone with my life.

117
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:41,390
Stop risking your life like it's a bet!

118
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:44,120
Have you forgotten that Mother asked you
to live well in her letter?

119
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,720
Qiushui, I trusted you once before.

120
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,120
But the result...

121
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,730
The Xiao family is now in grave danger.

122
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,850
We cannot afford any mistakes.

123
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,420
Focus on resting and recovering now.

124
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,850
[Xiao Residence]

125
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,270
Miss Tang.

126
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,150
Where is Qiushui?

127
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:28,650
Big Brother was crippled by
that bastard Qu Hanshan,

128
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,030
and his martial arts were ruined.

129
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,630
He's resting in his room now.

130
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,930
You've escaped.

131
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,630
Good.

132
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,710
How did you get injured so badly?

133
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,040
Qu Hanshan actually dared to...

134
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,590
It's nothing.

135
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,440
I just carelessly

136
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,900
fell into
that old scoundrel Qu Hanshan's trap.

137
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:40,270
I'm sorry.

138
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:42,960
I couldn't do anything to help you.

139
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,910
This is the first time
I've heard you

140
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,110
say sorry, Miss Tang.

141
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,200
It wasn't your fault.

142
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,030
How about

143
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,790
lending me your lucky darts?

144
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,740
What, still so stingy?

145
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,800
Look how badly injured I am.

146
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,720
Lend me one of your darts

147
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,690
so I can protect myself.

148
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,510
You're really giving it to me?

149
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,510
I'll take it then.

150
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:39,550
Thanks.

151
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:44,480
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

152
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,290
I heard from Zuoqiu that

153
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,330
there's a reclusive master

154
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,080
who created a uniquely powerful
Healing Salve

155
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,790
capable of mending bones
and reconnecting tendons,

156
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,080
which might cure my injuries.

157
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,560
Where is that master?

158
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:10,910
Brothers,

159
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,670
there's something you must do.

160
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,360
This Qu Hanshan is a sly fox.

161
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,320
You need to take Tang Fang

162
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,250
to a place 15 miles outside the city

163
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,190
and tie her up.

164
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,510
Big Brother, I don't think
that's appropriate.

165
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,240
Why not?

166
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,680
Remember what Tang Rou asked of us?

167
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,390
We must keep his sister safe.

168
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:31,320
Go now.

169
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,550
Yes.

170
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,600
That master lives in seclusion
15 miles south of the villa.

171
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,510
I originally wanted to go myself,

172
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:42,310
but I feared I wouldn't be able to
talk my way into getting that salve.

173
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,330
There's no time to waste. I'll go now.

174
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:50,790
Don't let anything happen before I return.

175
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:51,780
Wait for me.

176
00:12:54,870 --> 00:12:55,470
Miss Tang.

177
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,010
Big Brother, how are you feeling?

178
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,230
Miss Tang did come back

179
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,320
as you expected.

180
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,560
It's just that
you're seriously injured now,

181
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,030
so stop worrying about everything.

182
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:20,050
She's already isolated in the Tang Sect.

183
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,390
Besides,

184
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,090
I can't let her be implicated anymore.

185
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,150
Moreover,

186
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:29,970
I promised Tang Rou
that I would take care of his sister.

187
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,720
If I fail to do that,

188
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,000
how could I ever face him

189
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,750
in the netherworld?

190
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,030
Big Brother, what nonsense
are you talking about?

191
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,630
Didn't you say it would be foolproof

192
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:49,120
and you'd come out unscathed?

193
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,180
Don't you lie to me.

194
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:53,880
Don't worry.

195
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:57,130
You don't even believe my words anymore?

196
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,900
Here, take your medicine.

197
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,270
I'm sorry, Miss Tang.

198
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:44,150
It's you.

199
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:45,630
Why?

200
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,550
Miss Tang, please stay calm.

201
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:49,120
They'll stay here with you until dark.

202
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,320
Once the mechanism is deactivated,

203
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,780
remember: do not return to Huanhua Villa,

204
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,200
and absolutely don't go to
Top Fairness Forest.

205
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:55,870
Big Brother wants you to return to
the Tang Sect immediately.

206
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,120
Xiao Qiushui?

207
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:00,130
What kind of scheme is he plotting
this time?

208
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,840
Miss Tang, until we meet again.

209
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,390
Don't go!

210
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,670
Keep a close watch on Miss Tang.

211
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,150
Yes.

212
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:09,550
Release me now!

213
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,910
I never thought that in this world,

214
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,840
being a hero would be so difficult.

215
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,960
But there's no chance left anymore.

216
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:22,940
My parents and friends...

217
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:25,390
Their fates have long since

218
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,590
become more than just
a few insignificant lines in a book.

219
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,650
My parents gave me the hope of life.

220
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,550
Even if I die,

221
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:36,120
I will expose Qu Hanshan's true colors.

222
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,560
Even if I can't return to the real world,

223
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:40,670
I accept it.

224
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,390
I wonder whether leaving Qiushui alone

225
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,440
in the villa

226
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,910
will turn out for better or worse.

227
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:01,040
Taking Qiushui along
would make the journey difficult.

228
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,660
Better to let him stay
and recover properly.

229
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,510
Qiushui is seriously injured.

230
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,310
Sparing him the hardship of travel
is for the best.

231
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:17,840
Mr. Qu.

232
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,330
I, on behalf of the Xiao family,

233
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,690
thank you for your help.

234
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,240
I, Qu Hanshan, have spent my life
fighting for justice.

235
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,080
I've long despised the Power Gang.

236
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,670
How could I stand by
and watch the Xiao family suffer?

237
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:31,750
Aside from the Five Tigers of Guangling
waiting in the Top Fairness Forest,

238
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,510
the righteous warriors from other sects
have all set out

239
00:16:33,510 --> 00:16:35,320
to meet at the tea pavilion
in the outskirts.

240
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,390
My sister Xueyu

241
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,320
is already waiting at the tea pavilion.

242
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,510
The situation is critical now.

243
00:16:39,510 --> 00:16:41,360
Mr. Xiao, we must set out immediately.

244
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:41,950
Please.

245
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,250
After you.

246
00:16:50,650 --> 00:17:01,340
[Top Fairness Forest]

247
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,030
Yiren, it's Qiushui.

248
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:13,770
Qiushui.

249
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:19,790
Qiushui?

250
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:20,400
This...

251
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:24,720
Mr. Qu.

252
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,030
It seems my brother Qiushui
has been waiting here for you,

253
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,430
specially to see you off.

254
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:34,080
Let's go.

255
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,500
Qiushui, what are you doing here?

256
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,570
Aren't you badly injured?

257
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,900
What are you doing here?

258
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:52,960
Qu Hanshan

259
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,110
has set aside past grudges
and tolerated our Xiao family.

260
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:01,550
I've come specially
to apologize to him.

261
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,350
Mr. Qu.

262
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:14,750
I was indeed in the wrong before.

263
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,370
My apologies.

264
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,590
Mr. Qu, it seems Qiushui

265
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,960
truly remembers your kindness.

266
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,920
Now that he realizes his mistake,

267
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,000
he's come specially to apologize to you.

268
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,680
So...

269
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,630
Mr. Xiao, your gesture

270
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,510
is quite unexpected.

271
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,350
Are you all right?

272
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,880
Mr. Qu.

273
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,440
I truly came to
sincerely apologize to you.

274
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:09,790
I was indeed

275
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,960
in the wrong before.

276
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,400
However,

277
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,310
there's something

278
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:21,120
I'd like to discuss with you in private.

279
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:32,280
It's about the Hero Command Token.

280
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:38,590
Yiren, Qiushui won't

281
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,300
talk nonsense again, will he?

282
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:46,680
Yiren.

283
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:48,510
Kaiyan.

284
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:18,720
Mr. Qu.

285
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:24,670
I know I offended you before.

286
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,290
Actually, the Hero Command Token

287
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:33,480
isn't as simple as you think.

288
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,520
What exactly are you trying to say?

289
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:49,070
Disgusting.

290
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:53,350
What exactly are you trying to say?

291
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,550
Just say it properly.

292
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,240
You're already in this condition.

293
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,110
Still trying to play tricks?

294
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,280
I-I don't want to play any tricks.

295
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,110
What I want to tell you is...

296
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,960
I'm going to tear off your mask!

297
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,840
You set me up!

298
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,830
The Sword King? This...

299
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,680
-Big Brother!
-Big Brother!

300
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:53,590
He truly is the Sword King.

301
00:22:53,590 --> 00:22:55,390
He never let anyone discover it.

302
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,680
-It's the Sword King.
-The Sword King?

303
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,270
Yiren.

304
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,930
It's Blood Qi Sword Energy.

305
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:08,080
Retreat!

306
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:10,990
-Qiushui.
-Qiushui.

307
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:12,480
-Big Brother!
-Big Brother!

308
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,070
Qiushui!

309
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,870
-Qiushui!
-Third Young Master!

310
00:23:14,870 --> 00:23:15,920
-Big Brother!
-Qiushui!

311
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,720
-Qiushui!
-Third Young Master!

312
00:23:18,510 --> 00:23:19,070
Qiushui!

313
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,620
Qiushui, how are you feeling?

314
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,820
Big Brother!

315
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:28,310
-Qiushui!
-Qiushui.

316
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,680
Qiushui.

317
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,090
You've been prepared to die all along.

318
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,480
Kaiyan.

319
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,160
Yiren.

320
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:56,200
I've caused

321
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,070
you trouble again.

322
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,960
Yiren.

323
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,510
I have

324
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:14,920
never lied to you.

325
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,240
Yiren, Kaiyan.

326
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:39,830
No matter what...

327
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,310
Qiushui.

328
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:45,110
You must save Father and Mother.

329
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,240
I promise you

330
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,880
to save our parents.

331
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,770
We'll save them. Don't worry.

332
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,200
Rest assured.

333
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,640
My dear brothers.

334
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,060
-Big Brother, I'm here.
-I'm here, Big Brother.

335
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:25,160
Qiushui.

336
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:28,630
Big Brother.

337
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,310
Qiushui.

338
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,000
-Qiushui!
-Qiushui.

339
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,510
Qiushui.

340
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,110
Qiushui.

341
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:41,400
I've made noodles for you. Come eat.

342
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,240
What are you waiting for, Qiushui?

343
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,550
The noodles are getting cold.

344
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,590
Qiushui, Mother made
your favorite noodles.

345
00:25:46,590 --> 00:25:47,270
Come on.

346
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:50,070
Qiushui, if you don't eat
these delicious noodles,

347
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:50,880
I'll eat them.

348
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,960
Qiushui. Qiushui,

349
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,510
it's time for practice.

350
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,320
Big Brother!

351
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,720
Big Brother, excellent sword skills.

352
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,560
Big Brother, your sword skills
are getting better and better.

353
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,440
Big Brother, take good care of Fang.

354
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,760
Who needs your care?

355
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:20,790
Qiushui, come eat the noodles.

356
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:21,480
-Qiushui.
-Big Brother.

357
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:23,030
Come eat. The noodles are getting cold.

358
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,310
-Qiushui?
-Come on, Qiushui.

359
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,240
What are you waiting for, Qiushui?

360
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,550
We're all waiting for you. Come on.

361
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,200
Qiushui, hurry up.

362
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,030
Qiushui, everyone's waiting for you.

363
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:30,110
Qiushui, come on.

364
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,310
Don't go, Qiushui!

365
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,680
-Qiushui!
-Where is Big Brother going?

366
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,200
-Qiushui!
-Qiushui!

367
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,790
-Qiushui!
-Qiushui!

368
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,790

What happened?

Third Young Master...

571
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,420
[Restart]

572
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:14,760
Feng Lang.

573
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:23,740
No.

574
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,760
You're not Feng Lang.

575
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,090
I was wondering

576
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:34,280
how long you'd keep mistaking me
for that Feng Lang.

577
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,470
Liu Suifeng.

578
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,510
We first met at Qunfang House.

579
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:53,130
If it weren't for your friend
surnamed Feng,

580
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:55,030
I wouldn't have escaped so easily

581
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,160
from Sword King Qu Hanshan's pursuit,

582
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,070
and I wouldn't have tracked down

583
00:40:59,070 --> 00:41:01,280
the Hero Command Token so easily.

584
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:02,280
But

585
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,240
I didn't wrong him, either—

586
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,170
right to the center of the forehead,

587
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,770
the most painless way to die.

588
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:12,920
You're disgusting.

589
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,030
You'd better not
make any rash moves.

590
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,880
You were injured by Sword King
Qu Hanshan's Blood Qi Sword Energy.

591
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,280
If I hadn't given you

592
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,510
the Herbal King's
Life-Extending Pill in time,

593
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,480
your heart meridians
would have been severed

594
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,080
beyond any hope of recovery.

595
00:42:05,840 --> 00:42:08,840
Even now, you're still pretending
to be a good person.

596
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,320
You're truly despicable.

597
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,450
Where exactly is the Hero Command Token?

598
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,460
You exploited my trust,

599
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,140
infiltrated the Xiao family,

600
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,280
and put Sword Manor in danger.

601
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:32,930
Now I've come to Guangling seeking help,

602
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:34,760
only to be framed and set up.

603
00:42:36,550 --> 00:42:38,480
That was your doing too, wasn't it?

604
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,190
Correct.

605
00:42:39,670 --> 00:42:40,880
All of your actions

606
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,640
have been within my calculations.

607
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,640
The only thing I didn't account for

608
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:48,920
was that you would play the hero
to such a reckless extent,

609
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,400
even willing to cripple
your own martial skills

610
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,230
for that impossible hope.

611
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:59,320
You're indeed a master of calculations.

612
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,920
But have you ever calculated

613
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,700
when your own end will come?
