1
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:45,680
Chief.

2
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,710
Liu Suifeng did exactly as you predicted.

3
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,710
He sent Song Mingzhu to the pharmacy
for medicine.

4
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,170
Could it be harmful to you?

5
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,340
It won't be.

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,530
Then why is Chief...

7
00:01:57,509 --> 00:02:00,280
I won't agree to what he wants to do.

8
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,480
But I can't talk him out of it either.

9
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,970
You should continue

10
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,520
to keep a close eye on Suifeng.

11
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,120
I understand.

12
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:10,910
Master.

13
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,030
Please reconsider.

14
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,960
The Tang Sect living medicine vessel said,

15
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,560
those who became living medicine vessel

16
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,160
are neither human nor ghost.

17
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,640
A fate worse than death.

18
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,800
Mingzhu is afraid.

19
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,870
Get out.

20
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,880
I don't want you to see

21
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,640
what I look like
after taking the medicine.

22
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,870
Turns out he endures pain
beyond what normal people could bear.

23
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,040
all for the Chief.

24
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,240
Master is turning himself

25
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,070
into a living medicine vessel for Chief.

26
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:24,200
He wants to trade his life for another.

27
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:26,040
Master.

28
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,630
Mingzhu will never leave your side.

29
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,110
I've called you all here today

30
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,530
because we've received news.

31
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:37,120
General Wu has started his journey
back to the capital.

32
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,870
The Falconry Whistle Organization
has colluded with the Northern Wasteland

33
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,470
and bypassed Immortal Pass.

34
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,430
They're using the waterways
to smuggle elite Northern Wastelanders

35
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:44,680
into Daxi

36
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,250
with sinister intentions.

37
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,560
General Wu's return journey
is extremely dangerous.

38
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,480
I ask you all
to ensure General Wu's safety.

39
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,430
Destroy the Falconry Whistle's base

40
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,890
and restore peace to Daxi.

41
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,430
Destroy the Falconry Whistle's base

42
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,360
and destroy the Waterways' schemes.

43
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,870
We will give our all.

44
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,870
That's right.

45
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,560
The survival of the nation
is every citizen’s responsibility.

46
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,190
We shall contribute our efforts.

47
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,120
We shall contribute our efforts.

48
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,400
Thank you.

49
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,190
Come.

50
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,800
Everyone, look.

51
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,560
Here.

52
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,620
You'll go this way.

53
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,390
You'll come with me this way.

54
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,510
Good. Is that clear?

55
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:30,000
Good.

56
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:39,560
Brothers.

57
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,480
This is Wu Jie.

58
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,560
Take a good look at him.

59
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,430
We'll set up ambushes along the route

60
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,600
and catch him completely off guard.

61
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,510
Good.

62
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,270
Nobody move!

63
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,950
You pack of scoundrels!

64
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,720
How dare you plot against General Wu!

65
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,120
Today, we brothers
will carry out heaven's justice.

66
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,980
Take them down!

67
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,240
Over ten martial world criminals
have been captured.

68
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,480
They all claim to be hired
by the Long River waterways.

69
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,720
Anyone who provides information

70
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,040
will be generously rewarded.

71
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,270
Whoever captures Wu Jie

72
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,510
will be rewarded ten thousand taels.

73
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,950
Around Zhoushan Town in Western Capital,

74
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,160
General Wu's whereabouts
have been discovered.

75
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,360
Likely due to the previous attack,

76
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,560
he has changed his route to the capital.

77
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,160
Near a Guan Temple in the west of town,

78
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,960
unknown martial world figures
have been spotted.

79
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,039
Guan Temple in the Western Capital.

80
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:45,000
Lord Guan is a man of great honour

81
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,200
who protected Han with absolute loyalty.

82
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,510
He deserves our admiration.

83
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,510
Such a pity

84
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,920
that years of warfare

85
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,720
have left his temple in disrepair.

86
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,980
After we strike at the heart of the enemy,

87
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,750
we will surely return
to rebuild the temple.

88
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,360
Now that traitors are ruling the court,

89
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,630
returning would only mean death for us.

90
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,120
Death itself doesn't matter,

91
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,870
but how can a true man
endure such humiliation?

92
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,840
We should return to Immortal Pass

93
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,720
and join our brothers

94
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,200
to fight all the way
to the Northern Wasteland capital

95
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,510
and see if they dare defy us again.

96
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,360
Jiang Yue!

97
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:19,570
Show some respect.

98
00:10:20,270 --> 00:10:21,600
I acknowledge my fault.

99
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,850
I can't blame you for this.

100
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,030
The people are in the depths of misery.

101
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,910
But the Emperor's authority is supreme

102
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,960
and his grace is like heaven.

103
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,330
We must not speak rashly against him.

104
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,150
If everyone acted this way,

105
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,120
there would be no order,

106
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:49,150
destroying a family's honour.

107
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,810
How disgraceful will that be?

108
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,720
If a nation loses its laws and principles,

109
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,080
disaster and ruin will follow swiftly.

110
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:58,270
A general in the field
may sometimes disregard orders,

111
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,480
but our country is facing many troubles

112
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,390
at this critical time
of repelling invaders.

113
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:03,270
If I were to act rebelliously,

114
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:07,200
I fear I would play
into the traitors' hands,

115
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,670
harm the state

116
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,550
and become a sinner for the ages.

117
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,600
Big Brother,

118
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,720
the court is summoning you back

119
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,070
only to kill you!

120
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,970
This is their conspiracy.

121
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,380
Even if we must return,

122
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,840
there's no need to rush.

123
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:21,600
Jiang Yue!

124
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,740
You guys may leave now.

125
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,000
Yes.

126
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:28,870
Yes.

127
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,840
Lord Guan,

128
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:37,840
our nation faces great peril now,

129
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,080
with Northern Wasteland invading

130
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,280
and traitors within.

131
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,320
With your loyal heart and courage,

132
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,750
please watch over this situation

133
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,910
and protect us.

134
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,910
This journey I take

135
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,510
will likely end in my death.

136
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,870
The traitors want me dead to feel secure,

137
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,870
the court wants me dead to feel at ease,

138
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,790
and the Northern Wastelanders
wants me dead to be content.

139
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:08,440
I, Wu Xie, count my life as nothing.

140
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,480
But our land remains divided,

141
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,390
and the Northern Wastelanders

142
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,990
have invaded without cause,

143
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,930
plundering, killing,
and seizing our people with cruelty.

144
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,280
Thus I swore to lead troops
against the enemy.

145
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,270
Now I have three wishes.

146
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:30,510
First, I pray for the nation's peace

147
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,500
and the world's tranquility.

148
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:34,390
If my death

149
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,000
can win the people's hearts,

150
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:38,750
eliminate traitors,

151
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,000
protect Daxi,

152
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:41,800
and restore our territory,

153
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,510
I will die with a smile.

154
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,360
My second wish

155
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,000
is that the court take only my life

156
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,910
and spare my brothers in arms

157
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,750
and the innocent civilians.

158
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,800
The border defence is weak.

159
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:00,830
We absolutely cannot withdraw.

160
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:04,270
A withdrawal would waste all our efforts.

161
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,140
Our brothers who shed blood and sweat

162
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,910
would have died in vain.

163
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,120
May Lord Guan bless us.

164
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,870
Big Brother.

165
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,450
The Emperor's messenger has arrived.

166
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:23,080
Greetings, General Wu.

167
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,010
Spread the word.

168
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,360
We leave immediately.

169
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,080
Yes, sir.

170
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,510
For my third wish,

171
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:50,440
I'm willing to go through
hell and high water.

172
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:51,480
Otherwise,

173
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:54,240
when our country is no longer a country,

174
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,790
how can we have homes?

175
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,510
When the nest falls,

176
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,890
no eggs remain intact.

177
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,670
I hope our frontline soldiers
can defend Immortal Pass to the death.

178
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,150
Hero,

179
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,910
you truly care about me.

180
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,720
I appreciate it deeply.

181
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:20,080
I'm not acting on impulse

182
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:22,510
or seeking fame for posterity.

183
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,430
I'm simply willing to die

184
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,750
to preserve my complete loyalty.

185
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,750
Brother.

186
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,960
Yuan'er.

187
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,250
Brother.

188
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,200
The Soul-Piercing Nail was just removed.

189
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,130
You should be resting properly now

190
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,210
and follow instructions.

191
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,080
Yuan'er.

192
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,410
You've really grown up,

193
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,680
not like before.

194
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,510
You used to follow me around
calling "brother" all the time.

195
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:04,150
Look,

196
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,510
now you're the one taking care of me.

197
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,240
Who told you to be so troublesome?

198
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:14,440
Oh right,

199
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,450
look at this.

200
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:16,790
This is...

201
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,240
This is for you.

202
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,000
For me?

203
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:27,840
It's beautiful.

204
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,880
Do you like it?

205
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,010
Of course I like it, it's from you.

206
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:32,120
Is it pretty?

207
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,720
It's gorgeous.

208
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,270
This medicine is too bitter.

209
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:55,440
How nice it would be
to have some fresh fish right now.

210
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,240
I'll go make some fish for you right away.

211
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,960
Wait for me.

212
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,170
Brother.

213
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,680
Who would have thought,

214
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,030
all the notorious villains

215
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:28,790
in the Daxi martial world have gathered.

216
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,510
Zhu the Great King, of the waterways,

217
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,160
has sent Wanli, Qianli, and Baili,

218
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,620
three great masters here.

219
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,790
Today,

220
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:40,680
we will capture General Wu
in one fell swoop.

221
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,920
How dare you!

222
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:45,110
Such treacherous traitors,

223
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,690
shameless and despicable!

224
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:49,680
Let me clear the obstacles for General Wu!

225
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:07,640
In the Western Capital,
there's revelry every night,

226
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,400
while at the border,
soldiers die wrapped in horsehide.

227
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,750
Poor Lord Guan,

228
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,610
no one even worships him anymore.

229
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,720
General,

230
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,660
it looks like there was just a fight here.

231
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,680
Mr. Yan.

232
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,030
As they say, a true man
would rather die on the battlefield

233
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,440
than perish at the hands of sycophants.

234
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:14,580
Those people I killed outside

235
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,230
aren't just scums of the martial world.

236
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:20,110
Northern Wastelanders have infiltrated
among them.

237
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,110
There's a bounty from the waterways

238
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,110
to ambush and kill you.

239
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,070
General Wu,

240
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,640
please reconsider.

241
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,920
If you're in danger,

242
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:30,880
it would be the same as

243
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,830
the death of countless civilians.

244
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:38,200
Mr. Yan speaks words of wisdom.

245
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,000
However...

246
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,790
However what?

247
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,200
Although I know this journey is dangerous,

248
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,160
I must still proceed.

249
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,400
Only by meeting the Emperor in person,

250
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:58,750
can I possibly protect our nation.

251
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,790
Daxi faces many hardships,

252
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,720
snd now is the time to repel our enemies.

253
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,270
If I were to back down,

254
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,270
I fear it would play right into

255
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:09,400
the schemes of
those treacherous court officials.

256
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,920
If something happens to you,

257
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,350
who else in the world

258
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,310
could lead troops
against the Northern Wastelanders

259
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,510
and protect our land?

260
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:17,510
Mr. Yan, your good intentions

261
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,830
are appreciated.

262
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,510
General Wu.

263
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
What if I use this Hero Command Token

264
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:28,960
to stop you

265
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,030
from returning to court?

266
00:20:42,550 --> 00:20:43,680
The fate of Daxi

267
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,000
is in your hands.

268
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,510
I have no choice.

269
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,480
I'll let you die knowing the truth.

270
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,510
It's you.

271
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,570
Where is General Wu?

272
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,480
General Wu has been captured
by my waterway agents,

273
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,240
Wanli, Qianli, and Baili.

274
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,560
Today at this Guan Di Temple,

275
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,640
you are the one we've been waiting for.

276
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,040
The number one madman
of the martial world,

277
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,920
Crazy Yan.

278
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,310
Your internal energy,

279
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,510
I shall take it all.

280
00:21:58,510 --> 00:21:59,160
Brother!

281
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:00,880
Brother!

282
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,760
Xiao Kaiyan, you're insane!

283
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,760
I won't let you hurt my brother!

284
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,920
Now that you have your real brother,

285
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,400
have you forgotten about me,
your second brother?

286
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,030
You're the one who harmed our parents

287
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,680
and destroyed the Xiao family.

288
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,440
You don't deserve to be my brother.

289
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,920
Then watch carefully.

290
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:19,960
See who is truly superior

291
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,070
and who is the true heir
of the Xiao family.

292
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,000
No!

293
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,360
You don't want him to die?

294
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,830
Fine.

295
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,590
As long as you obediently follow my orders

296
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:40,790
and do as I say.

297
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,750
I promise you.

298
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,310
As long as you don't harm my brother,

299
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,830
I'm willing to exchange my life for his.

300
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,030
I won't let you die.

301
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,030
Crazy Yan,

302
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,060
didn't you want to see General Wu?

303
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:00,350
Take him away.

304
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,900
Alliance Leader Xiao.

305
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,760
We were ambushed
on our way back to the capital.

306
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,240
The General,
seeing the situation was suspicious,

307
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,440
ordered us to split up

308
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,640
and take the imperial tiger tally with us

309
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,440
to pass it to you, Alliance Leader Xiao.

310
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,700
I ask that Alliance Leader Xiao
safeguard this tiger tally

311
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:20,120
and rescue the General.

312
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,550
Qiu.

313
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,350
Take Deputy Commander Jiang to rest.

314
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,310
Yes.

315
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:39,350
Thank you.

316
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,610
Deputy Commander Jiang, please.

317
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,030
I've carefully selected these for you.

318
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,330
Do you like them?

319
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,720
Don't frown.

320
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,720
You're not beautiful when you frown.

321
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,100
Look at my water fortress.

322
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,460
It's a hundred times more magnificent
than Huanhua's.

323
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:28,310
If you come with me,

324
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,920
whatever Yiren and Qiushui can give you,

325
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,450
I'll give you twice as much.

326
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,310
Wealth and luxury,

327
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,510
power and prestige,

328
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,130
you'll have it all.

329
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,290
I want to see my brother.

330
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,960
As long as you behave,

331
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,010
your brother won't die.

332
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,200
I'll even let you see each other often.

333
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:08,600
How about wearing this one?

334
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,970
It suits you quite well.

335
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,810
It looks beautiful.

336
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,520
Mr. Yan, you're very clever.

337
00:25:48,070 --> 00:25:49,730
You didn't struggle too much.

338
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,010
You should know that I've already blocked

339
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,140
all your pressure points.

340
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,420
The Three Crown Kings of the Outer Realm.

341
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,070
You are Baili, Frozen Pavilions,

342
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,280
Qianli, Lone Plum Blossoms,

343
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:17,960
and Wanli, Endless Plains.

344
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,680
As expected of Crazy Yan.

345
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,270
We've been in seclusion for years,

346
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,800
yet you still recognise us.

347
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,030
I just never thought

348
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,750
we would meet here.

349
00:26:31,030 --> 00:26:32,880
If I hadn't promised General Helian

350
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,440
to prioritize the greater mission,

351
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,070
I would really like to test my skills
against the best in the Central Plains.

352
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,200
You're just talking to yourselves.

353
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:44,650
You think I can't break through
these pressure points?

354
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,550
Mr. Yan's martial arts are unparalleled.

355
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,160
Of course you can.

356
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,070
However,

357
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,680
I won't give you that much time.

358
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:11,160
Mr. Yan's martial prowess

359
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,240
will soon be mine to use.

360
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,510
The "Voidheart Codex"
from the Central Plains

361
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:32,040
actually contains such strange techniques.

362
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,510
What's happening?

363
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,000
Why can't I absorb

364
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,550
all your power?

365
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,550
The Voidheart Codex

366
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,200
must have been obtained

367
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,270
through despicable means, right?

368
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:13,720
So you only know how to absorb,

369
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,550
but not how to transform the energy.

370
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:17,030
Want to absorb my power?

371
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:19,510
Be careful not to burst yourself.

372
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:21,680
That's not for you to worry.

373
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,680
Sooner or later,

374
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,550
I will take

375
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,690
every single bit of your power.

376
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,750
Seniors,

377
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,030
please take good care of Mr. Yan.

378
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:58,960
I heard that Chief

379
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,200
will be entering the palace tomorrow.

380
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:03,070
Today, Suifeng

381
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,580
has come specially to see you off.

382
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,680
I wish you a smooth journey.

383
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:19,270
May the great cause planned for Daxi

384
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:20,200
surely succeed.

385
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:24,680
Suifeng,

386
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,860
that's thoughtful of you.

387
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,100
The second cup.

388
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:07,720
I wish the Chief good health

389
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:08,750
and longevity.

390
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,960
In life or death, I, Suifeng,

391
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:13,630
am willing to follow you, Chief.

392
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:15,250
Before drinking this cup,

393
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:18,310
I also have a toast

394
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,070
for you.

395
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,350
I hope when this is over,

396
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,310
you can have your own life,

397
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:30,880
not bound by the Power Gang,

398
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,430
not bound to me,

399
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,330
nor trapped by grudges.

400
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,830
I will try my best.

401
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:50,640
Why?

402
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:54,400
It’s in this wine

403
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,200
that your true dream lies.

404
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,240
Have a good sleep.

405
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,350
Chief.

406
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,590
You can't enter the palace.

407
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,270
How is he?

408
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,680
He won't eat or drink,

409
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,220
and doesn't say a word.

410
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,310
Your mind is in chaos.

411
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,350
It's only a matter of time
before you lose control of your powers.

412
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,110
Shut up!

413
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,640
At a time like this,

414
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,720
you still dare to be so insolent?

415
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,590
Go!

416
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,290
Bring Xiao Xueyu here.

417
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,510
Yes.

418
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:12,960
Brother.

419
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,270
Xueyu.

420
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,310
Don't you have a lot to say to him?

421
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:21,720
Try to persuade him.

422
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,910
-Brother.
-I'm alright.

423
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,550
In a few days,

424
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,070
I'll find a way to get you out.

425
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:36,920
No need.

426
00:33:38,310 --> 00:33:39,750
I don't want you to take risks for me.

427
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:40,280
Brother.

428
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,040
Listen to me.

429
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,270
What I'm about to say is crucial.

430
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:46,870
Come here.

431
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,920
The Voidheart Codex.

432
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,880
The 15 tiers of the Voidheart Codex are

433
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:04,400
Heaven's Will, Earth's Shape, King's Rule,
Family's Love, Master's Teaching,

434
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:10,150
Metal's Break, Wood's Resist, Water's
Flow, Fire's Spread, Earth's Cover,

435
00:35:10,710 --> 00:35:16,400
Sun's Glow, Moon's Reflection, Wind's
Path, Cloud's Shade, and Self's Void.

436
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,650
The carriage has arrived.

437
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,880
Shirong,

438
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,590
it's time to go back.

439
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,670
For your first time in the capital,

440
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:44,870
you stayed in the palace for three days.

441
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:48,850
The second time, you stayed for ten days.

442
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:53,710
After that, your stays
have became longer and longer.

443
00:37:57,030 --> 00:37:58,070
This time,

444
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:02,110
I don't know when you'll return.

445
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,230
Things

446
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:11,320
always get harder as they progress.

447
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,670
Fortunately,

448
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:19,110
it's almost over.

449
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:36,320
Don't worry.

450
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,410
As long as I've done my best,

451
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,030
I have no regrets.

452
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:04,840
Chief!

453
00:41:05,230 --> 00:41:05,760
Chief!

454
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:12,800
Master!

455
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:14,660
Master, you're awake.

456
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,510
Has the Chief

457
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,790
already entered the palace?

458
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,320
Yes.

459
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:24,400
No!

460
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,130
I must get him back.

461
00:41:27,150 --> 00:41:28,360
Master!

462
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,030
Even if we chase after him now,

463
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,290
it's already too late.

464
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,230
The Chief has maneuvered through life.

465
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:43,920
His actions must've been
carefully considered.

466
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:44,670
I hope...

467
00:41:46,230 --> 00:41:47,110
I hope the Chief

468
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:51,010
can use his internal energy
to suppress the poison.

469
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,550
As long as it doesn't damage
his heart meridian,

470
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,680
there might still be a glimmer of hope.

471
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,320
Master, please don't panic.

472
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,510
There must be a way.

473
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:19,110
Drink this herbal medicine
to calm your nerves.
