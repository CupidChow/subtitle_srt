was killed by the Power Gang.

186
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,530
I believe you all already know this.

187
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,930
It's truly unfortunate.

188
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,150
Your father, Mr. Xiao,

189
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:09,550
had always been a representative
of righteous sects in Jindu,

190
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:11,440
protecting the martial world here
for many years.

191
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,600
Now that the Huanhua Sect's
foundation has been completely destroyed,

192
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,320
we, the martial artists of Jindu,
all feel deeply threatened as well.

193
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,960
Indeed.

194
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,580
Over 100 people from the Huanhua Sect
have died.

195
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,640
It's truly tragic.

196
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,600
Everyone.

197
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,000
The reason I've invited you all here today

198
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
is to discuss this matter together.

199
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:31,960
Someone.

200
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,790
[Huanhua Sect]

201
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,860
Huanhua Sect?

202
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,480
They're planning to rebuild the sect?

203
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,480
Reestablishing the Huanhua Sect?

204
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,120
This is great news.

205
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,440
Reestablishing the Huanhua Sect.

206
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,500
We must support it.

207
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:54,140
He's trying to reestablish the sect?

208
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,840
Indeed.

209
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:56,840
Right.

210
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,840
Good news.

211
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,890
Reestablishing the Huanhua Sect?

212
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,870
Everyone.

213
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,720
I am a man of limited virtue and talent.
In terms of martial skills

214
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,080
and status in the martial world,
I can't hold a candle to my father.

215
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,940
But now that my father has passed,

216
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,360
I, Xiao Yiren, wish to reestablish
our Huanhua Sect

217
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:21,600
and lead the martial world of Jindu.

218
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,240
Today I reopen our sect here,

219
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,120
recruiting new disciples,

220
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,670
and I hope you all
can lend me your support.

221
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:32,430
Of course we'll support
the revitalization of the Xiao family.

222
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:33,360
That's right.

223
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,440
Huanhua regaining its glory

224
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,300
benefits us all with no downside.

225
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,440
Yes, indeed.

226
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,270
Congratulations, Mr. Xiao.

227
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:42,530
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

228
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:47,200
Mr. Xiao, your ambition

229
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:48,510
impresses us all.

230
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:52,230
May I ask what plans you have
for reestablishing Huanhua?

231
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:57,150
Years ago, our ancestors, to protect
the martial world of Jindu,

232
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:59,670
leased the land between the Xiao family
and Tang Sect

233
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:03,130
to various sects in Jindu for free
under a 100-year agreement.

234
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,600
Now that Huanhua is being reestablished,

235
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,240
I hope

236
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,790
you all can return the land

237
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:11,400
and pay the rent for the past 100 years.

238
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,630
100 years of rent?

239
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,320
So much?

240
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:14,870
Mr. Xiao.

241
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:16,750
But your father promised

242
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,480
to lease the land to us for free.

243
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,960
It was because my father

244
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,030
valued the brotherhood among
Jindu's martial arts sects.

245
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,430
But now that our Xiao family
is in distress,

246
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,000
I hope you all
can show some understanding.

247
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:29,840
But it was your father, Xiao Xilou,

248
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,200
who leased the land to us.

249
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,870
What right do you have to take it back?

250
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,150
I am now the young leader
of the Xiao family.

251
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,480
Are you questioning me?

252
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:37,390
To be honest,

253
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,200
our sect has signed a contract
with the Tang Sect yesterday.

254
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:40,510
You...

255
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,720
I've paid the annual rent of that land
to the Tang Sect.

256
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,870
If you want money or grain,

257
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:45,550
you can ask the Tang Sect for it.

258
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:46,440
Tang Sect?

259
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,750
Our Guidao Sect's land

260
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,600
has also been promised to the Tang Sect.

261
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,860
Have you all forgotten

262
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:53,910
that what you owe the Xiao family now

263
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,150
is far more than just a land deed?

264
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,160
Xiao Yiren.

265
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,480
By acting this way,

266
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:02,130
aren't you afraid of ruining
the Huanhua Sect's reputation?

267
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,600
My father Xiao Xilou was kind-hearted
all his life,

268
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,030
which is why Huanhua
has its reputation today.

269
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:09,960
But what has this reputation brought us?

270
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,750
It has only brought people like you

271
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,680
who have forgotten past kindness!

272
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:15,870
Huh? What even is this?

273
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:16,440
Enough.

274
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,960
Let's end these hurtful words here.

275
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,850
I believe you all understand
what's at stake.

276
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,670
I'll give you all half a month's grace,

277
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,270
with the deadline being 11:45 a.m.
on the first day of next month.

278
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:31,200
I expect everyone to hand over
the deeds and money.

279
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,360
I knew Mr. Xiao

280
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,090
was setting a trap for us today.

281
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,520
I'm leaving.

282
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,700
We're leaving!

283
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,840
Third Young Master of the Xiao family?

284
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,510
It's him.

285
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,550
The Xiao family's downfall
is all his fault!

286
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,910
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

287
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:08,310
Today is the day of
Huanhua Sect's reestablishment.

288
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,640
What are you doing here?

289
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,349
Yiren.

290
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,280
Father and Mother once told us,

291
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,200
a gentleman never uses kindness
to demand repayment.

292
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:24,109
They are all despicable people.

293
00:17:24,310 --> 00:17:27,349
How can we be like them?

294
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,160
Stop your shameless talk.

295
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,900
These martial artists

296
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,720
sought to protect their own interests
when our Xiao family is in distress.

297
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,160
Their lack of loyalty and righteousness
came first.

298
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,440
I'm merely repaying them in kind.

299
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,750
What's wrong is there in that?

300
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:44,000
If I don't use these methods
to revitalize the Xiao family,

301
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,130
what else could I do?

302
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,070
I don't mean to accuse you.

303
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:53,720
But if you use such means
to manipulate people's hearts,

304
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:55,810
isn't that the same as the Power Gang...

305
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,570
Shut up!

306
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,970
How dare you bring up
the Power Gang again!

307
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:02,170
If it weren't for you
letting the wolf into our house back then,

308
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,350
giving that villain Liu Suifeng
an opportunity,

309
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,830
would our Xiao family have suffered
such a catastrophic disaster?

310
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:07,510
Yiren.

311
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,030
Do you know
why I didn't return to Sword Manor

312
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,310
after the seventh day
following our parents' passing?

313
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:21,400
It was because I was afraid that
if I saw you,

314
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,200
I wouldn't be able to hold back
from punishing you!

315
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:26,200
You've really let me down!

316
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,600
Yiren, please calm down.

317
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,880
Qiushui has lost all his martial skills.

318
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,480
Why bother arguing with him?

319
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,510
Does his behavior

320
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,980
do justice to our Xiao family's name?

321
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:27,750
Qiushui.

322
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,070
Qiushui!

323
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,040
[Liang Residence]

324
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:52,700
Qiushui, you're awake.

325
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,200
Mr. Liang.

326
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,010
Don't move.

327
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,890
You haven't fully recovered yet.

328
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:00,750
Mr. Liang,

329
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:02,920
where am I?

330
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,330
The reconstruction of Huanhua Sect
will take some time.

331
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,000
This is my private residence.

332
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,880
It's big enough for you and your friends
to live in together.

333
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,880
I'm troubling you again.

334
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:15,480
Mr. Liang.

335
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,020
Thank you for your help all along.

336
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:20,440
I've heard about

337
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,820
everything you've been through.

338
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,680
You have extraordinary courage,

339
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,310
forming the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood
to fight against the Power Gang.

340
00:20:27,310 --> 00:20:30,370
Actually, you're already famous
throughout the land.

341
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,240
Unfortunately, I couldn't
protect anything.

342
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,690
Nothing has changed at all.

343
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,120
I originally thought

344
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,960
that I alone could shake
the entire martial world.

345
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,030
You've been unconscious for two days.

346
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,360
You probably don't know

347
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:56,280
what's happened out there.

348
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,640
Come on, follow me.

349
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:12,110
-Mr. Xiao!
-Mr. Xiao!

350
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:17,400
Greetings, Mr. Xiao!

351
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,200
The Du family of Fuhu Sect from Guangling

352
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,860
has come to pay respects
to our savior, Mr. Xiao.

353
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:26,030
The Five Tigers of the Xu family
from Guangling

354
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,760
have come to pay respects
to our savior, Mr. Xiao.

355
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,590
Baibu Sect from Guangling

356
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:32,350
has come to pay respects to Mr. Xiao.

357
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:33,790
Greetings, Mr. Xiao!

358
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,530
Qiushui.

359
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,030
Mr. Xiao.

360
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:45,400
Thanks to your risking your life days ago
to expose Qu Hanshan

361
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,330
as the Sword King of the Power Gang.

362
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,720
More than 10 of our sects joined forces

363
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:52,030
to drive back Qu Hanshan's minions.

364
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,270
Unfortunately, we arrived too late

365
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,880
to help the Xiao family.

366
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:03,920
Are you saying

367
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:09,070
I saved more than 10 of your sects?

368
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,000
Yes, indeed.

369
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,680
All the martial arts sects in Guangling

370
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,280
have risen up in resistance.

371
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:16,610
Qu Hanshan's influence in Guangling

372
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,720
has greatly diminished, too.

373
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,960
Right, indeed.

374
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,240
Mr. Xiao!

375
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,310
Mr. Xiao.

376
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:30,310
I'm a personal guard of the Wu family.

377
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:33,370
This is a handwritten letter
from Old Madam Wu herself.

378
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,180
You work for General Wu at Immortal Pass?

379
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,350
A letter from Old Madam Wu?

380
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,240
A handwritten letter
from Old Madam Wu herself?

381
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,300
What's happening?

382
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:41,200
What does it say?

383
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,790
Indeed.

384
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,030
"Thanks to the kindness of Huanhua Sect,

385
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,000
I, carrying the token of immunity
bestowed by the late emperor,

386
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,720
have cleared my son's false charges.

387
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,270
Afterward, he led his troops
straight to Immortal Pass, and on the 15th

388
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,830
of this month, launched a night attack
on the Northern Wastelanders,

389
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,510
reclaiming over 100 miles of territory.

390
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,510
I hereby send this letter
to announce our victory.

391
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,710
Written by Madam Wu."

392
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:01,090
Victory news from the Immortal Pass.

393
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,330
It's been two years,

394
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,640
and the front finally sent
the first report of victory.

395
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
Wonderful! It's victory news!

396
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,350
Great! Victory news!

397
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,350
Great! That's wonderful!

398
00:23:12,970 --> 00:23:13,690
Great!

399
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,880
According to the plot I remember
from the book,

400
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,110
Old Madam Wu should have died

401
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:19,590
on her way to the Immortal Pass.

402
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:22,680
On the 15th, the Northern Wastelanders
should have launched a night attack

403
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,070
on the Immortal Pass. But now,
General Wu has led his troops

404
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,880
to the Immortal Pass

405
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,510
and defeated the Northern Wasteland Army
outside the pass.

406
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:29,510
So this world has already been changed.

407
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,510
I can also rewrite

408
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:32,970
Xiao Qiushui's story now.

409
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:33,880
Mr. Xiao.

410
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,500
You saved so many of us.

411
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:38,160
Today, we didn't come to
the Xiao Residence

412
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,550
just to talk.

413
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,690
Yes, disciples from all our sects

414
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:44,000
have brought large quantities of
quality wood and stone materials,

415
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,270
and they're now
at the foot of the mountain.

416
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:47,240
Starting today,

417
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,740
we'll help you rebuild the Huanhua Sect!

418
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:53,270
We hope you can rally
and recover your strength, Mr. Xiao.

419
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:54,700
Yes, rally and recover!

420
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:00,350
Mr. Xiao.

421
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,510
If you don't mind,

422
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,680
please accept us all as disciples under
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood

423
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,270
and let us establish
a branch for you in Guangling.

424
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,480
What do you say?

425
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,240
That's right!

426
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,930
Right, establish a branch!

427
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:14,590
Right.

428
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,070
Let's build a branch!

429
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:16,790
Count me in!

430
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,750
We'll all go together!

431
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,230
Right, let's join
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

432
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:19,920
Everyone,

433
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:24,650
thank you for your support and trust.

434
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:26,920
But right now,

435
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:31,070
I cannot take on this responsibility.

436
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,510
We only acknowledge Mr. Xiao!

437
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,440
Right.

438
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,400
We only acknowledge Mr. Xiao!

439
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,680
Please stop declining, Mr. Xiao.

440
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,680
That's right.

441
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,080
We only acknowledge you.

442
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,560
Qiushui,

443
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,590
I don't think you should decline
any further.

444
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,640
Right, Mr. Xiao, please stop declining.

445
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:48,720
Say yes, please.

446
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,480
Say yes.

447
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,310
Stop declining.
We'll all follow your lead.

448
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,510
Come on, get on board.

449
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,400
Everyone,

450
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,880
I, Xiao Qiushui,
cannot take the position of leader.

451
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,270
But I welcome you all

452
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,270
to join the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

453
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,030
Great! Mr. Xiao has finally agreed!

454
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,750
Wonderful!

455
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:16,310
Everyone,

456
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:19,270
let's start rebuilding the Xiao Residence!

457
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:22,030
Let's get to work!

458
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:22,960
Great! Let's go.

459
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,290
By the way, Qiushui.

460
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,140
Your sister has been reading
some ancient books

461
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:35,590
and found a way
to reconnect the meridians.

462
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,750
You go ahead.

463
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,630
Leave the matters here to me.

464
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:03,920
Miss Tang.

465
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,720
According to what you've said,

466
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,920
the person you want to save

467
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,790
not only has completely severed meridians,

468
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:09,830
but also has

469
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,880
a powerful conflicting internal energy
inside his body.

470
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,750
In my 50 years of medical practice,

471
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:20,270
I've never heard of such kind of injury.

472
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,440
The fact that he's still alive

473
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,070
is already heaven's blessing.

474
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:31,880
Mr. Liu,

475
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,400
even you can't save him?

476
00:26:38,310 --> 00:26:41,310
This prescription can help
clear his energy channels

477
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,110
and extend his life for a few years.

478
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,110
But if you want him to fully recover,

479
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,680
I truly have no way to help.

480
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,510
So in this martial world,

481
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:54,550
there's no one else who can heal him?

482
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,480
Forgive my prying,

483
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,480
but this person you want to save

484
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,630
is your beloved, isn't he?

485
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:10,790
Mr. Liu, why would you ask
such a question?

486
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,720
Your father Tang Yaoshun,
as head of the Tang Sect,

487
00:27:16,590 --> 00:27:18,270
is not only skilled in medicine

488
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:21,000
but also masters
the bone-dislocation technique.

489
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
When it comes to reconnecting meridians,

490
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,240
asking him would be far better
than asking me.

491
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,110
If you weren't deliberately
hiding this from him,

492
00:27:31,110 --> 00:27:32,960
why would you have come to me?

493
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,490
You must decide
whether to save this young hero

494
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,420
or keep hiding it from your father.

495
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:40,960
The choice is yours.

496
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:44,940
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

497
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:03,270
Qiushui.

498
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:07,920
Qiushui?

499
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,040
Big Brother.

500
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,120
Big Brother, you're awake.

501
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,110
Xueyu, how long have I been asleep?

502
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,870
Two days and two nights.

503
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:34,310
Only 40% of your meridians have been
reconnected. You need to rest well.

504
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,480
Thank you, Xueyu.

505
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,960
Come on, guys.

506
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,370
Let's go practice our swordsmanship.

507
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,070
Big Brother!

508
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,960
Xueyu said your recovery only allows you
to handle your daily activities.

509
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,310
She never said you could
start practicing martial arts.

510
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:45,160
Your wrist still feels like
it's being cut with a blade.

511
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,620
Why rush yourself so much?

512
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,000
I've lost all my martial skills,

513
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,470
so I have to start from scratch.

514
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,550
I'm out of time.

515
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:02,270
Again!

516
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:04,050
-Big Brother!
-Big Brother!

517
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,240
Please take a break.

518
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:07,370
If you keep going like this,
your body will collapse.

519
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:07,930
I'm fine.

520
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:09,040
Big Brother!

521
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:10,310
Xueyu also said

522
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,480
that reconnecting meridians
is like cutting into bone and marrow.

523
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,110
There's no need to rush your revenge.

524
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,110
You should rest and make long-term plans.

525
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,640
With the time you spent advising me,

526
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,030
we could have practiced a few more moves.

527
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:19,720
Again!

528
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,010
Excellent sword skill.

529
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,550
I didn't expect that in just a few days,

530
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,210
you'd recover to this extent.

531
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:33,840
Thanks a lot, Mr. Liang.

532
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:35,770
I can never repay the kindness

533
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,200
you've shown me recently, Mr. Liang.

534
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,400
No need for such formalities.

535
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,240
It's my honor to support young talents

536
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,440
in the martial world.

537
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:43,980
By the way, Qiushui.

538
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,710
That day at Xiao's Sword Manor,

539
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,920
I found something,

540
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,300
but I didn't dare to give it to you.

541
00:30:49,390 --> 00:30:52,020
Now, I can finally hand it over to you.

542
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:59,100
[To my son.]
[From Xiao Xilou]

543
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:09,550
To my sons: Yiren, Kaiyan, and Qiushui.

544
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:14,200
The siege on Sword Manor
is now impossible to break.

545
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:19,410
If I never see you again, it'll mean that

546
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:25,160
in this battle, the Xiao family has died
protecting loyalty and righteousness.

547
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,400
I have no regrets.

548
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,720
I'm writing this letter
to make my wishes clear.

549
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:38,830
Over 100 years ago, our Xiao family
was also nearly destroyed.

550
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:43,400
But our ancestors, through broken swords,
expressed their resolve.

551
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,440
They forged 128 broken swords into
the Changge Sword,

552
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:52,350
gathering the loyal and righteous souls
of the Xiao family into one sword.

553
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,000
Those of you who see this letter

554
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,200
must be the ones to carry on our will.

555
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,660
The Changge Sword
has a spirit of its own.

556
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:07,270
In times of danger,
it will find its master through fate.

557
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,640
Remember, my sons.

558
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,110
The sword is broken and reforged.

559

560

Even if the body is destroyed
and the bones crippled,

561
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,240
it's just a new start.

562
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,830
If you can retrieve the Changge Sword,

563
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,350
the legacy of Huanhua Sect will never die.

that staying at Sword Manor
meant certain death.

571

That's why he sent you to escape
and seek help.

00:42:16,190 --> 00:42:19,120
Even if the body is destroyed
and the bones crippled,

719
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:21,730
it's just a new start.

720
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,280
The sword is broken and reforged.

721
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,740
The flower blooms itself.

722
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,400
Son, remember:

723
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:32,510
even if you're shattered to pieces,

724
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,510
it's merely a chance to start anew.
