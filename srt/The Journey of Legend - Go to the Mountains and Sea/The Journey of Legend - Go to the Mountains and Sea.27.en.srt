1
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:45,560
Young man,

2
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,789
I will pass on all my internal energy

3
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:49,250
and martial skills to you.

4
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,150
Kill him for me.

5
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:54,190
Young man,

6
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:56,150
I'll pass my powers to you too.

7
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,640
Let's see which of us is more powerful.

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,860
We'll also pass our powers to you.

9
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:25,960
Seniors!

10
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,190
Seniors!

11
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,470
No, Seniors!

12
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,360
Senior.

13
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:46,680
Se…

14
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,720
Young man.

15
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,240
Senior.

16
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,280
Hold on a little longer.

17
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,120
I have heard

18
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,360
about the youngest son of the Xiao family
and the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

19
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,630
You were never meant for the Daoist path.

20
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:12,270
But to save the Daxi martial world,

21
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,360
to fight the Power Gang,

22
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:22,240
no one but you can do it.

23
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,630
Xiao Qiushui,

24
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,159
have you remembered everything?

25
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:37,560
I have.

26
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:40,490
I'll never forget.

27
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,070
Senior,

28
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,190
is this your sword sheath?

29
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,800
What if it is?

30
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,870
The mark on it—

31
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,480
was it left by you?

32
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,870
You recognize this mark?

33
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,720
Tell me now.

34
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,120
Which sect does it belong to?

35
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,830
Senior,

36
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,480
if you don't know,

37
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,950
where did you

38
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,510
get this sheath?

39
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,040
Half a month ago,

40
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,400
an old friend's entire sect

41
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,010
was brutally slaughtered.

42
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,360
By the time I arrived, it was too late.

43
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:30,000
My good friend died with hatred.

44
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:35,390
With his last breath,
he said he found a traitor in his sect

45
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,750
who colluded with outsiders.

46
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:42,560
This mark was found
in their secret letters.

47
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,600
Who could it be?

48
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:49,000
Who could be so ruthless?

49
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,600
I only know

50
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:57,159
this is a secret group
hiding in the martial world,

51
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,580
likely colluding
with the Northern Wastelanders.

52
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,600
If I don't avenge my friend,

53
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:12,630
I… I can never rest in pea…

54
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,160
I never thought

55
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,030
that before dying,

56
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:34,870
I'd take on

57
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:38,909
such a talented disciple.

58
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,510
For decades,

59
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,240
we've been at each other's throats,

60
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:13,480
but now, we all share one disciple.

61
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,720
You three have all died,

62
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,320
leaving me alone in this world.

63
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,510
I've long grown weary

64
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,600
of living in this world.

65
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,600
The road to the underworld beckons.

66
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,910
How lonely.

67
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,870
The eight seniors
came from different backgrounds,

68
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,240
yet all devoted their lives
to martial arts.

69
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,380
People say good and evil cannot coexist,

70
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,320
but martial arts themselves
know no good or evil.

71
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,620
Good people use them for good.

72
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,500
It's evil thoughts that bring disaster.

73
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,510
I hope in another world,

74
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,720
you'll no longer be bound by factions

75
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,510
and can fight freely

76
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,330
for the joy of it without being disturbed.

77
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,150
That must be delightful.

78
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,850
The Eight Masters are all dead?

79
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,600
What exactly happened?

80
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:21,350
It's fine.

81
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,080
Glorious even in defeat.

82
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,120
I've defeated five challengers.

83
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,700
I think here at the Golden Summit,

84
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,870
none can rival me.

85
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,600
Why don't you all just admit defeat?

86
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,600
How arrogant!

87
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,140
I'm Zhichen, leader of the Emei Sect.

88
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,080
Show me what you've got.

89
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,330
Abbess Zhichen is so powerful.

90
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,030
So why has the Emei Sect
weakened over the years?

91
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,270
It's said she suffers from an old illness.

92
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:11,440
I'm afraid she's depleting

93
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,500
her internal energy for this battle.

94
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,840
Qiushui?

95
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,090
Why does he look so much like Qiushui?

96
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,910
Greetings, Chief.

97
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,270
Li Chenzhou.

98
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,790
Abbess Zhichen.

99
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:27,360
Pardon the intrusion.

100
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,630
How could two people look so much alike?

101
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,480
Li Chenzhou!

102
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,340
What are you trying to…

103
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:51,950
The Tribulation Finger?

104
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,480
You're so knowledgeable, Abbess.

105
00:14:54,550 --> 00:14:55,880
The Tribulation Finger

106
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,670
can control one's vital meridians.

107
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:01,550
If Chief wants you to live, you live.

108
00:15:02,510 --> 00:15:05,390
If he wants you to die, you die.

109
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:13,510
Everyone.

110
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,200
Have you all

111
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,800
given up on the "Voidheart Codex"?

112
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,300
If we all attack together,

113
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:23,960
we might stand a chance.

114
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:43,870
What I hold is the Infinite Pill.

115
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,030
Whoever kills this fiend

116
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,150
will get this priceless pill.

117
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,030
You're under the control
of my Tribulation Finger

118
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:25,910
only because your internal energy
is weaker than mine.

119
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,440
With the Infinite Pill,

120
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,490
you can break free from it.

121
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,390
I'm curious to see

122
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,080
if you'll risk your life to kill me

123
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,000
or seize the Infinite Pill
to save your own lives.

124
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,510
I haven't restored the Xiao family yet.

125
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,640
I cannot be controlled by Li Chenzhou.

126
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,910
Zhu the Great King.

127
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,910
The Infinite Pill! The Infinite Pill!

128
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,240
Over there! Over there!

129
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:09,790
Qiushui!

130
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,339
-It's mine!
-Give it to me.

131
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,079
Yiren, don't be fooled.

132
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,040
This Infinite Pill is fake.

133
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,240
Shao Liulei poisoned it

134
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,640
to get back at Zhu the Great King.

135
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,569
What did you say?

136
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:23,930
It's poisoned?

137
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,960
You do look a bit like me.

138
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,480
Th-They look so much alike.

139
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,110
Almost identical.

140
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,080
Shusui is much more handsome
than Li Chenzhou.

141
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,920
So what if we look alike?

142
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,830
I am nothing like you.

143
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,680
Here it is. I found it.

144
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,430
It's mine.

145
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,400
Give it to me!

146
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,030
It's mine!

147
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,680
Give it to me.

148
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,880
-Mine!
-Give it to me!

149
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,160
Give it to me!

150
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:29,880
Disgraceful!

151
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:32,240
Move!

152
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,690
It's poisoned!

153
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:36,090
It really is poisoned.

154
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,310
It's really poisonous. He's dead.

155
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:38,440
He's dead. He's really dead.

156
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,550
He's really dead. It's poisonous.

157
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,880
It's really poisonous.

158
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,440
Truth is less believable than lies,

159
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,510
because truth is always harsher to hear.

160
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,280
After fighting tooth and nail,

161
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,110
this is the result.

162
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,750
I gathered you all here

163
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:04,270
to unite the masters of martial arts

164
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,200
against the evil Power Gang.

165
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,760
However, some people
got their priorities wrong,

166
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,810
caring only for the Infinite Pill.

167
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,680
What a disgrace.

168
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,690
Where is Zhu the Great King?

169
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,480
He fooled everyone!

170
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:23,920
Qiushui,

171
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,860
how did you know the pill was fake?

172
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:34,110
Young Master Yiren, don't you know
what's happened to your brother?

173
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:38,000
He's already taken the real Infinite Pill.

174
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,200
The pill is gone.

175
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,900
If you all want to live,

176
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,550
there's only one way left.

177
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,980
Everyone, be careful!

178
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:06,310
The Tribulation Finger
is an extremely profound evil technique.

179
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,310
We came here to rid the world of evil.

180
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,190
How can we let him control us?

181
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,640
How despicable.

182
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:19,070
Xiao Qiushui,

183
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,170
it's time you handed over
the Hero Command Token.

184
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,510
Li Chenzhou!

185
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,880
The Power Gang slaughtered
the Xiao family.

186
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,550
Today,

187
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,610
I'll avenge my parents

188
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:04,720
and the 127 disciples of the Huanhua Sect!

189
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,680
The Wudang Sect's Taiji Sword Technique!

190
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,510
Nice moves,

191
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,960
but not refined enough.

192
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,280
The Shaolin Sect's techniques.

193
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:18,280
How can Xiao Qiushui use both Shaolin
and Wudang's martial skills?

194
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:25,960
Oh, no,

195
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:26,880
is Qiushui planning

196
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,920
to die together with Li Chenzhou?

197
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,480
Chenzhou, it's cold
and damp on the mountain.

198
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,540
Better put this on.

199
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,300
Don't catch a cold.

200
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:13,400
You're certainly one
of the most prominent young people

201
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,000
in the martial world right now.

202
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,310
I won't kill you today.

203
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,700
If you don't kill me today,

204
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:29,070
I'll kill you one day.

205
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,640
Fine.

206
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,510
I'll be waiting.

207
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:46,270
What brought you
to the Emei Sect this time?

208
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,270
I've always had only one purpose.

209
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:06,030
Use this together
with the Hero Command Token.

210
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:17,270
Look.

211
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,080
What is this?

212
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,530
It's a map, isn't it?

213
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,750
What is this?

214
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,160
It's a map?

215
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:36,830
Yes.

216
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,720
Years ago, the Northern Wastelanders

217
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,130
marched south and seized the capital.

218
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,830
They wanted to transport the treasure
and martial arts manuals back north,

219
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:47,920
but on the way,

220
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,160
they were intercepted
by General Wu's troops.

221
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,240
During the chaos,

222
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:55,360
the treasure was scattered
in Nantian Abyss.

223
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,310
Nine years ago,

224
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,110
Crazy Yan accidentally
entered Nantian Abyss.

225
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,480
He found the treasure

226
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,440
and hid it again.

227
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:14,270
So he carved the treasure map
on the Hero Command Token.

228
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:23,440
So Crazy Yan's original plan

229
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:25,480
was to have Old Madam Wu

230
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:28,160
reveal the location of the treasure

231
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:29,510
to General Wu.

232
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:32,350
That's right.

233
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,310
Unfortunately,
this matter was too important

234
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,570
to be spoken of openly.

235
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,070
Some people with ulterior motives

236
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,030
mistakenly believed the token

237
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,160
was related to the "Voidheart Codex."

238
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:47,240
Alright.

239
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,410
Now that you all know the truth,

240
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,680
come with me to find the treasure.

241
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,840
If anyone is unwilling,

242
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,040
just die here at the Golden Summit.

243
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:02,680
Qiushui,

244
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:05,640
it is a shame
that Daxi's treasure lies forgotten

245
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,640
in the mountains.

246
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,310
But we can't fully trust the Power Gang.

247
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,110
I've freed most of the people here
from the Tribulation Finger.

248
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:28,240
Those who are still under its control
are all useful.

249
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,290
Three days from now,

250
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,770
we'll meet at the entrance
of Nantian Abyss.

251
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,370
I know you want
your parents' remains.

252
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,750
Once this is done,
they'll be returned to you.

253
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,370
And another thing—

254
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,960
your parents weren't killed
by the Power Gang.

255
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,480
Believe it or not,

256
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,300
you'll find the answer yourself.

257
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,640
Qiushui has brought honor
to the Huanhua Sect

258
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,040
in front of all the sects.

259
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,440
Too bad Kaiyan isn't here.

260
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,310
Yiren is not happy to see this.

261
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:42,920
Enough.

262
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,270
If Kaiyan were here, he'd be controlled
by the Tribulation Finger too.

263
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:50,160
Neither Yiren nor Kaiyan
is as good as Qiushui.

264
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,070
Abbess.

265
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,160
Li Chenzhou

266
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,440
has actually got the Tribulation Finger.

267
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,170
He could've wiped out
all martial arts sects.

268
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:13,550
I've failed my seniors' expectations.

269
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,040
I couldn't kill Li Chenzhou.

270
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,790
You did well.

271
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,880
You tried your best and saved all of us.

272
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,720
I saw the martial skills you just used.

273
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,310
Did you learn them
from the Eight Masters:

274
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,480
Tieji, Yinping,

275
00:30:32,150 --> 00:30:33,350
Muye, Fanhua,

276
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:35,880
the East-West Twin Swords,

277
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,510
Suiyu, and Canjin?

278
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:39,750
Yes.

279
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,510
Those eight seniors

280
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,130
have already...

281
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:51,750
They passed all their powers to you.

282
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,240
That means they truly trusted you.

283
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:01,400
Abbess.

284
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:04,920
Qiushui,

285
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,240
the martial world needs someone new

286
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:11,510
who has his own way

287
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:15,400
to make everyone
believe in justice again.

288
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,510
I'm already a cripple.

289
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,790
From now on, it's all on you.

290
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:23,970
Alright.

291
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:26,750
Abbess,

292
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,740
please don't say more.

293
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,450
You'll definitely be fine.

294
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:34,640
Please.

295
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,110
Qiushui,

296
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:45,000
are we really going
to Nantian Abyss in three days?

297
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,510
We have no choice now.

298
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,750
Many people are still controlled
by the Tribulation Finger.

299
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,210
Besides, Li Chenzhou said

300
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,240
he has my parents' remains.

301
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,720
I have to go.

302
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,130
Big Brother,

303
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,770
do you really believe him—

304
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,690
that your parents weren't killed
by the Power Gang?

305
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,440
I don't trust anyone.

306
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,510
I'll find

307
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,590
the answer myself.

308
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,750
Such a pity.

309
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,070
Qiushui was so close

310
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,730
to killing Li Chenzhou today.

311
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,790
Actually, he had a chance to kill me.

312
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:29,990
I originally thought

313
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:33,110
Liu Suifeng pretended to be the lucky bag

314
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:36,830
because he's R.

315
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,000
R?

316
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,950
But he's Li Chenzhou's right-hand man.

317
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,920
Would he really act on his own?

318
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,550
Could Li Chenzhou be R

319
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:49,030
and order Liu Suifeng to do that?

320
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,940
The Emei Sect gathered
all martial arts sects this time

321
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:55,510
to discuss fighting
against the Power Gang,

322
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,440
but someone with ulterior motives

323
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,920
spread rumors that the "Voidheart Codex"

324
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:01,780
was in Li Chenzhou's possession.

325
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,140
His purpose for doing this

326
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:07,110
must be to create chaos.

327
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,550
You mean

328
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:11,480
R wanted to use this opportunity

329
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,740
to destroy the entire martial world?

330
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,130
My goodness!

331
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,040
Big Brother,

332
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,360
what are you talking about?

333
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,160
What does "R" mean?

334
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,400
Sancai said the road ahead is long.

335
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:29,000
I said we have to keep moving forward.

336
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,960
We've always been on this road,

337
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:32,620
haven't we?

338
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,480
That's right.

339
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,100
We've always been on the road.

340
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:40,720
Let's go.

341
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:41,270
Alright.

342
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,790
Go, go, go!

343
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,790
Go!

344
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,000
Yiren, since you returned
from the Golden Summit,

345
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:57,040
you've been in low spirits.

346
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,510
I keep hearing rumors

347
00:34:04,070 --> 00:34:06,070
about Qiushui in the martial world.

348
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:09,510
They say at the Golden Summit gathering,

349
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,120
Qiushui had mastered
the "Voidheart Codex."

350
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,480
Absurd.

351
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:16,880
Complete nonsense!

352
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,760
Yiren, don't be angry.

353
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:22,400
Actually, Qiushui has always

354
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,820
listened to you since childhood.

355
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:28,960
Maybe he just hasn't had the opportunity.

356
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:30,590
Yiren,

357
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,580
the Xiao family is at a disadvantage now.

358
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,030
Since Qiushui has made a name for himself,

359
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,760
why not let him restore the family?

360
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,030
He's so famous now.

361
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,190
How could we possibly persuade him?

362
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,590
Perhaps Qiushui has already been thinking

363
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,630
of handing the Changge Sword to you,

364
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,620
but he's just too proud

365
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:58,630
to tell you.

366
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,680
-Qiushui.
-Big Brother.

367
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:07,730
You're back.

368
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,690
Is everything alright?

369
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,550
What about the task I gave you?

370
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,030
While the Power Gang's elite forces

371
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:15,110
were at the Golden Summit,

372
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,150
we eliminated 12 of their small outposts
along the way.

373
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:17,880
Twelve!

374
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,070
Qiushui,

375
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,070
everyone's heard
what you did at the Golden Summit.

376
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:22,070
You were amazing.

377
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:23,690
Big Brother,

378
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,550
are you hiding something from us?

379
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:27,000
The martial skills you used
at the Golden Summit

380
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,200
weren't the Huanhua Sword Techniques.

381
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,890
It's not that I meant to hide anything.

382
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:35,670
It's just that what I went through
was too bizarre.

383
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,280
Bizarre?

384
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,130
Big Brother,

385
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,140
what happened?

386
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,440
Tell us about it.

387
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,630
Yeah, tell us.

388
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:42,920
Yeah.

389
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,010
Do you remember
that day on the Golden Summit,

390
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,670
when the Eight Masters fell off the cliff?

391
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,370
When I went after them,

392
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,920
I found
those martial arts fanatics sparring.

393
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,710
By chance,

394
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:00,710
they actually passed
all their internal energy

395
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:02,800
and secret techniques to me.

396
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,840
If that's the case,

397
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,280
Big Brother, you now possess

398
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,280
the skills of the eight greatest masters
of our time?

399
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,350
That's right.

400
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:11,960
Qiushui,

401
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,230
you're getting more and more formidable.

402
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:16,290
You truly look like a sect leader now.

403
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,280
That's a bit of an exaggeration.

404
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:20,630
Alright.

405
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,360
Enough talk.

406
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:25,230
Go back and rest.

407
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,800
We have more important matters later.

408
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,890
Big Brother, have a good rest too.

409
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,070
Let's go.

410
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:31,800
Let's go.

411
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,330
Let's go.

412
00:36:33,550 --> 00:36:34,360
Keep up.

413
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,510
Qiushui.

414
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,560
Qiushui.

415
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,590
You must be hungry.

416
00:36:37,590 --> 00:36:39,250
I'll get you something to eat.

417
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,070
Fatty, where's the kitchen?

418
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:44,050
I'm talking to you, Fatty.

419
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,190
Qiushui.

420
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:58,630
Yiren.

421
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,410
Why are you here?

422
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,190
What,

423
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:07,110
since Xueyu's wedding,

424
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,960
have you decided to never return

425
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,290
to the Xiao Villa again?

426
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,930
That's not the case.

427
00:37:21,510 --> 00:37:23,710
The Hero Command Token is so important,

428
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,670
yet you didn't even mention it to me.

429
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:27,000
If you ask if I blame you,

430
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,480
of course I do.

431
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,650
But it's understandable.

432
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,910
Times are difficult now.

433
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:38,280
And you've grown up.

434
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,290
You have your own mind.

435
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,010
That's normal.

436
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:48,320
I came today

437
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:52,230
hoping that the misunderstandings
between us

438
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,410
could be cleared up.

439
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,630
If you're free tonight,

440
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,970
come to the villa for a talk.

441
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:02,630
By the way,

442
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,480
Kaiyan was too ill
to attend the Golden Summit gathering,

443
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,070
and he's much better now.

444
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,650
He also wants to see you.

445
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:12,880
Alright.

446
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,650
Faced with the powerful enemy,

447
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,280
we brothers

448
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,490
should indeed have a good talk.

449
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,150
Yiren,

450
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:27,280
I'll definitely come tonight.

451
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:51,320
Yiren.

452
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,480
Qiushui.

453
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,020
Thank you, Kaiyan.

454
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:13,550
This tea…

455
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:19,250
It's made from bamboo leaves
from our backyard.

456
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:22,560
It's been a long time since I had it.

457
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:28,040
Yiren only brought a few leaves out

458
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,130
and rarely makes tea with them.

459
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:31,750
Now that you're here,

460
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,010
he's prepared tea especially for you.

461
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,320
By the way,

462
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:44,840
when I was tidying
the villa the other day,

463
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:47,930
I found some of Mother's old belongings.

464
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,540
She embroidered this by hand.

465
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,440
Inside is your favorite camellia.

466
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:39,630
Thank you, Yiren.

467
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:46,170
I know there have been
many misunderstandings between us lately,

468
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,760
so I hope today

469
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,360
we can speak openly

470
00:40:51,630 --> 00:40:52,710
as brothers.

471
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,510
Yiren,

472
00:40:58,550 --> 00:41:00,080
that's exactly what I want.

473
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,170
Let's drink.

474
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,200
It's been a long time.

475
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:06,530
Let's drink.

476
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,930
Since that's the case,

477
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,890
I want you to tell me honestly.

478
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,800
Where did your internal energy
and martial skills

479
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,230
really come from?

480
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,940
That day at the Golden Summit,

481
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:39,760
the Eight Masters passed them to me.

482
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,250
The Eight Masters?

483
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:42,280
Qiushui,

484
00:41:43,070 --> 00:41:44,730
you've never met them before.

485
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,120
Why would they pass their powers to you?

486
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:48,840
We're family.

487
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,550
You can just tell us the truth.

488
00:41:56,230 --> 00:41:59,440
It indeed sounds bizarre.

489
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:03,710
But there are people in this world
who just follow their hearts,

490
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,630
doing things beyond reason.

491
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:08,150
Yiren.

492
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:09,710
Kaiyan.

493
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,400
I wouldn't make up

494
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,710
such a story to fool you.

495
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:17,150
The situation is urgent now.

496
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:19,080
So I'll be straightforward.

497
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:19,960
Qiushui,

498
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,110
did you secretly practice
the "Voidheart Codex"?
