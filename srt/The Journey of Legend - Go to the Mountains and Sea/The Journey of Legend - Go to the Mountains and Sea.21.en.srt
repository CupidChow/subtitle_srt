[The Journey of Legend]

2
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:43,850
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:57,190
Shao Liulei, how dare you!

4
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,710
I will kill you!

5
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,350
Mr. Shao, why did you do this?

6
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,400
Boy.

7
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,350
If Crazy Yan really sent you to find me,

8
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,960
he'd surely be protecting you in secret.

9
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,280
But when this girl
tried to steal the pill,

10
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,610
he still didn't show up.

11
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,210
This proves you're lying.

12
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,430
The moment

13
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,500
you claimed
that Crazy Yan felt guilty toward me,

14
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,829
you gave yourself away.

15
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:21,630
He abducted me for 10 years,

16
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:23,630
using every cruel method imaginable on me.

17
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,510
How could he possibly feel guilty?

18
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,450
So Shao Liulei was testing me
from the very beginning.

19
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,910
Never thought
he'd been scheming all along.

20
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,050
What's even more ridiculous is

21
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:35,500
that you want to take this Infinite Pill.

22
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,190
Since you know

23
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:40,630
he forced me to take
half of the Yang pill,

24
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,710
in no case would he
leave the Yin pill behind.

25
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,630
This last pill is the half Yang pill.

26
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,360
Once you take it,

27
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,750
you'll end up with the same fate as me,

28
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:51,079
being tortured by the primal Yang energy.

29
00:02:51,079 --> 00:02:52,360
That's worse than death.

30
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,160
You're not his younger brother.

31
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,079
You lied to me!

32
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,610
I hate being deceived more than anything.

33
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:10,790
You all say I betrayed them
to help Crazy Yan.

34
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,230
But it was actually Zhu the Great King

35
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,630
using me as a shield
against his fatal move.

36
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,590
He deceived me, too.

37
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,150
He lied to me

38
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:26,710
that the Long River's waterways
would see me as a hero.

39
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:29,480
But after suffering for so many years,

40
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,840
I escaped only to hear

41
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:34,010
that you all consider me a traitor.

42
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,640
Why did I escape?

43
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,280
Was it really to offer this elixir

44
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,480
to Zhu the Great King?

45
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,560
I want him to swallow it.

46
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,150
I want him to suffer

47
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,090
from the primal Yang energy every day
just like me.

48
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,290
I'll make all of you who once deceived me

49
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,310
taste every bit

50
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:56,910
of the suffering I've endured!

51
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,120
You attacked me from behind when I was
suffering from the primal Yang energy.

52
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,390
Guess what I most want to do now.

53
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,800
What do you want to do?

54
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,750
My body is about to burst
due to the primal Yang energy.

55
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,890
I need to balance Yin and Yang, of course.

56
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,950
They told me that in Yunxia Mountain,

57
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:33,140
there are spiritual insects
used to make Yin pills.

58
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,510
Taking them would relieve my suffering.

59
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:39,010
But I've searched for so long
and found nothing.

60
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,630
All liars!

61
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,830
Now I'll use you to relieve my pain.

62
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,850
Do you know who I am?

63
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:48,760
I know.

64
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,690
A beautiful woman.

65
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,990
I work for Mr. Liu, Liu Suifeng.

66
00:04:56,310 --> 00:04:57,909
If you dare lay a finger on me,

67
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,610
my master will make you suffer
a hundred times more than you do now.

68
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:05,190
Even if what you say is true,

69
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,450
do you think I'd care about it?

70
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,950
You look so beautiful when you're angry.

71
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,320
Don't you dare!

72
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:32,490
Shao Liulei,

73
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,310
you'll regret this.

74
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,720
Boy,

75
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,530
you're way too nice.

76
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,630
Mr. Shao,

77
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,800
what makes us human

78
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:08,560
is that we must have some dignity.

79
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,870
Dignity?

80
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,400
Who are you to talk to me about dignity?

81
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,240
Do you know what I've been through
these past ten years?

82
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,500
I've lived like neither human nor ghost,

83
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:32,320
worse off than a rat!

84
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,190
Have you ever suffered like I have?

85
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,180
Not having experienced my pain,

86
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:40,010
how dare you talk to me about dignity?

87
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,390
Since you're so righteous,

88
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,640
swallow this Yang pill.

89
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,770
Then you'll end up just like me.

90
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,020
I have Crazy Yan's vital energy
to keep me alive.

91
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,070
But you don't.

92
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,550
You'll be tortured to death
within two hours.

93
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:00,350
But you can learn from me.

94
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:02,480
Use this girl

95
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,560
to ease your pain for a few days.

96
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,510
Then let me see

97
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,310
what you'll choose between your life

98
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,200
and your dignity.

99
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,920
Boy,

100
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,360
if death comes after the sexual pleasure,

101
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,760
I'd call it a good ending.

102
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,800
I've sealed this girl's pressure points

103
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,680
and yours, too.

104
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,000
I'll throw both of you
to the bottom of the valley.

105
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,800
By then,

106
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,240
an antidote at your disposal

107
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:41,040
will be lying right beside you.

108
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,530
You...

109
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:42,760
What will you choose?

110
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:47,800
To live

111
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:49,950
or to die?

112
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,000
To live

113
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,870
or to die?

114
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,750
To live

115
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:57,920
or to die?

116
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,000
Zhu the Great King,

117
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,410
I haven't gotten even with you yet.

118
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:23,400
The Yang pill is gone,
and I'll get you another poisonous pill.

119
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,670
I must have my revenge.

120
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,000
You took that pill.

121
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,720
A-Are you alright?

122
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,480
Song Mingzhu,

123
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,900
I'll never forgive you
for massacring my family.

124
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,300
If you want to live,
get the hell out of here.

125
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,190
Unlock my pressure points.

126
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:02,500
I can help you heal.

127
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,190
Shut up!

128
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,040
Xiao Qiushui.

129
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:13,440
Now you can kill me if you want.

130
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,040
I have no strength to resist.

131
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,380
Even if you saved me,

132
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,150
next time,

133
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,320
I'd still fight you with all my might

134
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,080
for my master

135
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:22,840
and show no mercy.

136
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,810
I can't unlock your pressure points.

137
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,080
I can't stop the pill
from taking effect on me.

138
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:29,750
Once the time's up,

139
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,470
your pressure points will be unlocked.

140
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,240
Listen,

141
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,640
get the hell
as far away from me as possible!

142
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:34,690
My body is about to burst
due to the primal Yang energy.

143
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,940
I need to balance Yin and Yang, of course.

144
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:39,000
They told me that in Yunxia Mountain,

145
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,070
there are spiritual insects
used to make Yin pills.

146
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:43,500
Taking them would relieve my suffering.

147
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:50,900
Snake venom.

148
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:54,030
Could it be that the white snake's venom

149
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,160
is the ingredient
for the Yin pill of the Infinite Pill?

00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,260
you're really different from others.

174
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,140
If it were me,

175
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,320
as long as I could survive
a few more days,

176
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:34,780
I wouldn't care about anyone else's life.

177
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:37,900
Thanks.

178
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,120
Stop there.

179
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,270
You people from the Power Gang

180
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:48,210
truly have no conscience.

Where are my parents' bodies?

183
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,690
You saved my life today.

184
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,610
So I'll tell you honestly.

185
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,330
Your parents' bodies

186
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:02,930
were taken away by my master.

187
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,280
But I really don't know

188
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,540
where he sent them.

189
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,390
As someone so close to him,

190
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,570
how could you not know?

191
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,650
My master only mentioned
he had leads to follow.

192
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,180
How could I dare to ask more?

193
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:22,900
You'd better not be lying.

194
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I should've killed you with one blow

195
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:29,770
and sent your bodies

196
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,180
one by one to the Sword Manor

197
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:35,790
to avenge
those of the Xiao family who died in vain.

198
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,510
Go tell Liu Suifeng

199
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,650
and that Li Chenzhou.

200
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:44,220
For the blood debts your Power Gang owes,

201
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,190
I will settle them one by one.

202
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:00,250
Xiao Qiushui has actually absorbed
the Infinite Pill.

203
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,990
Isn't Master in danger then?

204
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,870
Have all the Power Gang members left?

205
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,780
Is this place safe now?

206
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,830
Roushui and the others are
dealing with the Power Gang.

207
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:12,690
Go ahead with what you want to say.

208
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,710
I risked my life

209
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,670
to seize this Infinite Pill

210
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:22,730
just to present it to the King.

211
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:34,270
You've done well.

212
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,450
I will tell the Heavenly King
about your dedication.

213
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,640
Long time no see, Kang Chuyu.

214
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,090
Xiao Qiushui?

215
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,590
What are you doing here,
you good-for-nothing?

216
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:06,370
Take a guess.

217
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,720
I have serious matters to attend to.

218
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,920
If you wish to die,
I'll come kill you later.

219
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,050
I'm afraid you won't be leaving today.

220
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,480
You're asking for death.

221
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:36,650
Didn't expect this man
to have such powerful internal energy.

222
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,850
Kang Chuyu.

223
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,210
You betrayed your friends,
against all loyalty.

224
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,340
You slaughtered the innocent,
against all morality.

225
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,600
You deserve to die the most tragic death!

226
00:16:59,050 --> 00:16:59,730
Today,

227
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,400
I will make you pay for the deaths

228
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,400
of over 100 people in my Xiao family!

229
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,200
Tang Rou,

230
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,120
did you see that?

231
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,670
I finally made Kang Chuyu pay
for your death.

232
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:35,620
Father,

233
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:37,640
Mother,

234
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,540
for the blood debts of our family,

235
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,500
I will settle them one by one.

236
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,330
Now that Zhu the Great King knows

237
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,760
that we're enemies
of the Shaolin and Wudang Sects,

238
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,040
you're still causing trouble everywhere
during this time,

239
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,170
hampering our gang's every move.

240
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:37,610
How dare you show your face here?

241
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,720
I know my sins are unforgivable.

242
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,010
But I submit myself
to the Chief's judgment.

243
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,140
I only want the Chief to give me a chance

244
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,420
to atone for my sins.

245
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:48,880
The Chief already gave you a chance before

246
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,880
and let you leave.

247
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,910
But you chose to stay.

248
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,530
Since you want this opportunity,

249
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,360
the Chief said

250
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,620
you must seek it yourself.

251
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,890
Is this what the Chief means?

252
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:04,410
I understand.

253
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:09,550
I'll set out for Wudang Sect now
to beg for forgiveness.

254
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,170
I never thought you'd be the one
to see me off in the end.

255
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,450
Liu Suifeng,

256
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:28,680
are you still suspecting

257
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:32,650
that I sent someone
to impersonate the Chief to frame you?

258
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:35,700
No way it was you.

259
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,650
You don't have the audacity

260
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,490
to have someone impersonate the Chief.

261
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,020
Put these on yourself.

262
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,450
Liu Suifeng,

263
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,770
wake up!

264
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,490
Don't you dare die on the way.

265
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,650
It'd mess up my mission.

266
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,400
The Chief wants me
to reach the Wudang Sect alive.

267
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,000
And I certainly will make it.

268
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,840
Greetings from the Wudang Sect.

269
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:30,720
Our sect leader sent us here
to receive you.

270
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,780
Please hand this criminal over to us.

271
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,960
Greetings, sirs.

272
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:36,010
When was this arrangement made?

273
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,270
I've never heard of it.

274
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,090
This is a letter from our sect leader.

275
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,810
[To the Power Gang]

276
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:46,090
He was concerned
about your fatigue from the long journey.

277
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,750
Since there's still some distance
to the Wudang Sect,

278
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:49,410
he ordered us to come meet you.

279
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,090
This is true.

280
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,330
Judging by the handwriting,

281
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:55,400
this is indeed
the Wudang Sect's official correspondence.

282
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,010
You two must be tired
from your journey north.

283
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:58,330
You could rest nearby.

284
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,740
We'll take the criminal from here.

285
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:13,960
Wait.

286
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,010
We only briefly informed the Wudang Sect

287
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,880
that we'd be escorting Liu Suifeng
to face punishment.

288
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,320
How did you know
we were traveling north?

289
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,520
Just a slip of the tongue.

290
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,530
Blade King, please don't overthink it.

291
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:28,290
We've been traveling discreetly.

292
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,820
We should have headed east.

293
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,790
But to avoid attention,

294
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:33,680
we deliberately detoured
to the southern stronghold

295
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,680
and then headed north to the Wudang Sect.

296
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,490
How could you possibly know about it?

297
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,590
Could it be that someone

298
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,790
leaked our itinerary to you in advance?

299
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:47,810
Tell me

300
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:49,920
who sent you here.

301
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,010
You must have

302
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,620
stolen our correspondence

303
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,660
and rushed to forge this letter, right?

304
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,200
Move!

305
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:03,530
Chieftess?

306
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:06,880
Chieftess.

307
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:12,090
We fell into their trap.

308
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,300
Thankfully, you came to help.

309
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,360
Thank you for your help, Chieftess.

310
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,160
These people have finally shown

311
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,530
their sly true colors.

312
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,280
Take them back for interrogation.

313
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,800
Yes.

314
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,440
Leave Liu Suifeng to me.

315
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,260
Even though you did something wrong,

316
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,350
he still can't bear to let you die.

317
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:51,990
[15 years ago]

318
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,170
Stop there!

319
00:24:51,510 --> 00:24:52,650
You brat! Stop there!

320
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:53,420
Stop!

321
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,010
Stop running!

322
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,760
I'll kill you!

323
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,470
Hey..

324
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,180
How dare you flee?

325
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,270
You won't get away!

326
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,010
I'll

327
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:04,700
beat you to death!

328
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,270
Why did you save me?

329
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,910
Why did I save you?

330
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,400
Let me think about it.

331
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,940
You saved my life.

332
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,960
In return, I'll help you kill a person.

333
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,040
That doesn't sound

334
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,250
very appealing.

335
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,800
Then I'll give my life to you.

336
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,160
Give your life to me?
That's not necessary.

337
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,570
I like the coldness in your eyes.

338
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:08,330
It would be a waste for you to die here.

339
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:14,970
Take this.

340
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:41,640
You've been following me all the way.

341
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,680
What's wrong?

342
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,130
My life is yours now.

343
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,890
Where else could I go
if I'm not following you?

344
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:50,790
But you've been tortured
to a terrible state.

345
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,490
What's the point of keeping you around us?

346
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,970
If I recover,
I can kill and plunder for you.

347
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,300
If not, I can chop wood and lead horses.

348
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,200
I can be useful either way.

349
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,410
Things have come to this point,

350
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:13,650
yet the Chief still hasn't abandoned me.

351
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:15,180
I felt something on the way.

352
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,080
I just didn't know
the Chief's detailed plan.

353
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,730
So I could only play along.

354
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,800
So you had noticed that it was

355
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,530
Chenzhou's plan
to lure the snake out of its hole.

356
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,870
If the Chief wants me to sacrifice myself

357
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,820
to appease the wrath
of the Shaolin and Wudang Sects,

358
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,910
I would do so without complaint.

359
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,010
Suifeng,

360
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:46,530
both Chenzhou and I
have long placed our trust in you.

361
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:49,390
We know that even if everyone
in our gang betrays us,

362
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,460
you never would.

363
00:27:51,490 --> 00:27:53,720
Our gang has made many enemies
over the years.

364
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,780
Our previous plans were all exposed.

365
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:56,920
Chenzhou thought

366
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,290
that there must be
spies and moles planted within our gang.

367
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,750
If we don't get rid of them,

368
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,260
there will never be peace in our gang.

369
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,640
So we utilized the case

370
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,680
of you killing Tianzheng and Taichan

371
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,280
to make a fuss and set up a trap

372
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,680
to root out these spies.

373
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,920
The Chief is truly far-sighted.

374
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:17,640
I owe my life

375
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,810
to you and the Chief.

376
00:28:21,050 --> 00:28:24,110
If there ever comes a day
when you truly lose trust in me,

377
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,440
I'll literally end up
like a walking corpse.

378
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,370
I'd rather die than live like that.

379
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,040
You should rest here.

380
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,850
I'll go back
to interrogate those traitors.

381
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:36,050
If there are any updates,
I'll send someone to inform you.

382
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,490
Master.

383
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,250
It's getting cold at night.

384
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:11,360
Please take care and rest well, Master.

385
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,050
I'm fine.

386
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,520
I heard you got into trouble,

387
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:16,960
and I was so worried.

388
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:18,890
My issue's been settled.

389
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:20,720
The Chief's no longer blaming me.

390
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,720
Master, if you leave the Power Gang,

391
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,400
I, the Red Phoenix,

392
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,240
will have no attachment to it either.

393
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,170
While I was away,

394
00:29:28,330 --> 00:29:30,730
how were things going
with the Xiao family?

395
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,160
Don't worry, Master.

396
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,920
Xiao Yiren's been sending
recruitment invitations all over Jindu,

397
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,920
trying to rebuild the Huanhua Sect,

398
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,440
but no one's interested.
They're getting nowhere.

399
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,090
Those small sects
that used to follow the Xiao family

400
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,400
have turned against them, too.

401
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,960
Xiao Yiren is headstrong and arrogant,

402
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,170
obsessed with being a hero.

403
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:51,710
But he only cares about maintaining
a hollow reputation.

404
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:53,670
He can't cause us any trouble.

405
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,570
But that Xiao Qiushui...

406
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,170
Someone like him

407
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,810
is lucky just to survive
in the martial world.

408
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,400
He doesn't deserve your attention, Master.

409
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,200
Do you genuinely think
he's not worth mentioning,

410
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:09,050
or are you trying to protect him?

411
00:30:10,570 --> 00:30:12,300
Please speak plainly, Master.

412
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:15,130
I can tolerate occasional failures,

413
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,530
but you should know well

414
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,710
about the consequences of betrayal.

415
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,400
I dare not do that.

416
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:25,290
I will never betray you
in my life, Master.

417
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,720
If you suspect me,

418
00:30:28,610 --> 00:30:30,010
you can kill me right now.

419
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,970
I suppose you wouldn't dare betray me.

420
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:39,000
You didn't mention a word
about the Infinite Pill.

421
00:30:39,570 --> 00:30:41,050
Did something go wrong?

422
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:44,340
Where is it?

423
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:47,870
One was swallowed by Shao Liulei.

424
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,010
And the other one

425
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,690
was grabbed by the Flame Lord, Cai Qishen.

426
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,800
Shao Liulei's martial arts are
stronger than mine.

427
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,060
I went through great trouble

428
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:58,590
just to escape and survive.

429
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,180
If this happens again,

430
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,820
don't bother coming back.

431
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:07,850
You may leave now.

432
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:09,060
Yes, Master.

433
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,750
Even if I'm willing to die for my master,

434
00:31:33,910 --> 00:31:36,830
it didn't move him at all.

435
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,580
Song Mingzhu,

436
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:44,440
what are you still fantasizing about?

437
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:49,410
I'm satisfied with just staying

438
00:31:50,290 --> 00:31:51,290
by Master's side.

439
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,960
These days, the Chieftess and I

440
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:08,950
have been secretly investigating clues
about this falconry whistle.

441
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,610
We only know it's a mysterious group
backed up by the Northern Wasteland,

442
00:32:11,610 --> 00:32:15,920
deliberately planted in the martial world
to work for the Northern Wasteland.

443
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,770
I always use one blade for one kill.

444
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,010
These are for you.

445
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,880
Confess or choose a blade.

446
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:22,840
It's up to you.

447
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:38,880
The Misery Pill from the Death Beetle is
incredibly powerful.

448
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,150
If you don't reveal
who's behind this falconry whistle now,

449
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:43,010
I'll let it roam inside your body.

450
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,530
By day, you'll suffer unbearable itching,
like being tortured by numerous ants.

451
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,880
At night, you'll endure excruciating pain,
like being skinned alive.

452
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,010
You'll keep begging

453
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:49,880
for relief.

454
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,010
I only know the leaders met
at Qingfeng Mansion.

455
00:32:55,050 --> 00:33:00,010
[Qingfeng Mansion]

456
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,850
Fire King, you made one wrong move,

457
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:31,160
then everything went wrong.

458
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,400
So you ended up here.

459
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:39,900
You and I are old acquaintances.

460
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,970
We've always been on good terms
in the gang and never fought before.

461
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:43,810
I've prepared a blade

462
00:33:43,810 --> 00:33:45,340
for each of you Seven Kings.

463
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,490
Take your pick.

464
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:58,130
Li Chenzhou must be out of his mind,

465
00:33:59,010 --> 00:34:01,200
sending you over to kill me.

466
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:02,460
That's not true.

467
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,360
I just want you to tell me

468
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,050
who's behind this falconry whistle.

469
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,970
As for whether we should
kill you, Fire King,

470
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:08,900
it's not up to me.

471
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,790
You traitor to the gang,

472
00:34:17,909 --> 00:34:19,440
you have nowhere to escape.

473
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,639
This is the Marching Pill formula

474
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,239
found in your mansion.

475
00:34:39,699 --> 00:34:41,230
And that falconry whistle.

476
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,830
They're enough to prove you betrayed us
and colluded with the Northern Wasteland.

477
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,360
What else do you have to say?

478
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,170
Since you have figured it out,

479
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,010
I need to say no more.

480
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,480
That's right.

481
00:34:54,969 --> 00:34:57,490
We've long been Falconry Whistle members.

482
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,840
Fire King,

483
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,860
you're an elder of our gang.

484
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:04,110
I'll give you a chance to make amends.

485
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:06,220
Tell us honestly who your superior is

486
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,660
and if there are others in the gang
working for the Falconry Whistle.

487
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,270
The Falconry Whistle's rise is
unstoppable.

488
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,490
It's too late for you to do anything!

489
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,160
Fine.

490
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:23,790
Then let me ask you.

491
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:26,370
Were you involved in the massacre

492
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:29,800
of the Baicao Valley back then?

493
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,680
I've been living
as quite a figure for all my life.

494
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,640
If I did it, I would never deny it.

495
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,090
If I didn't do it,
in no case would I admit it.

496
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,840
I stole that formula
from the Diancang Sect.

497
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,090
As for this Baicao Valley,

498
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,490
I know nothing about it.

499
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:53,970
You, Liu Suifeng,
just killed Tianzheng and Taichan,

500
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,570
causing outrage
throughout the martial world.

501
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,200
How dare you still keep him by your side?

502
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,610
The Power Gang's days are numbered,
I guess.

503
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,800
As for everything I've done,

504
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:10,050
it was all for long-term planning.

505
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:13,570
You're thinking too highly of yourselves.

506
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,020
You think you're the only ones who know

507
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:20,240
what's inside that Hero Command Token?

508
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:23,090
Still showing no remorse, you'll be

509
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,020
dealt with under the gang's rules!

510
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:29,010
I've long anticipated this day.

511
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,970
Back then,

512
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,320
to prevent wars
among the Eight Kings, Li Chenzhou

513
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:35,410
made us take

514
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:38,160
the Misery Pills made from our own blood.

515
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:43,800
Now I've mastered
the foreign Vein Melting Technique

516
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,380
and have already
purged the poison from my veins.

517
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,200
If they kill me, the poison will act up,

518
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,010
and they can only see themselves die.

519
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:58,570
But I can kill them!

520
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,260
The Death Beetle has
come out of his body.

521
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,800
The restriction effect of the Misery Pill
in the Fire King's body is removed.

522
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,800
He is no longer one of the Eight Kings.

523
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,000
We can attack him now.

524
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:42,290
I'll take you to hell with me!

525
00:37:42,630 --> 00:37:45,580
I'll use this Flame Palm
I've hidden for a decade

526
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:48,160
to burn you all to ashes!

527
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,980
This blade is called Piercer.

528
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,980
Your death honors its name.

529
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,460
I feel sorry for you, Suifeng.

530
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:20,500
He's not the foe you're after.

531
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,770
You will have to wait again
to get your revenge.

532
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:31,160
At least we retrieved the formula
before it fell into the wrong hands.

533
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:34,420
This should bring some peace
to the souls of Baicao Valley.

534
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,200
But the Fire King was determined to die.

535
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:42,460
The Falconry Whistle's spies
and their plans

536
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,250
will need further investigation.

537
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,200
The Fire King refused to confess
till his death.

538
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,640
It shows how far-reaching
the Falconry Whistle's schemes are.

539
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:54,280
They tricked Suifeng into killing
Tianzheng and Taichan,

540
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,490
creating conflicts between us
and the Shaolin and Wudang Sects

541
00:38:56,490 --> 00:38:59,220
as well as internal strife
within the Power Gang.

542
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,490
They're clearly no ordinary adversaries.

543
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,720
As flawless as the disguise technique was,

544
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,780
it could only be the Thousand-Faces Mask
of the Fei's three greatest artifacts.

545
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,930
Back then, Mr. Fei claimed

546
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:24,060
that the Thousand-Faces Mask was
burned and destroyed.

547
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,370
But I've always had my doubts about that.

548
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,970
I have indeed heard
that this Thousand-Faces Mask

549
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:32,430
has the miraculous power
to deceive anyone.

550
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:34,770
If our enemies truly possess it,

551
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:37,500
it'll be even more difficult
to deal with them.

552
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,680
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

553
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:44,370
We don't have much time left.

554
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,280
Suifeng.

555
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,720
Send someone to investigate

556
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,430
whether this matter is related
to the Fei family.

557
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:55,910
Yes.

558
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,320
Besides,

559
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,430
tell the Ghost King to speed up

560
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,500
and produce more Death Beetles
as soon as possible.

561
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,180
The Ghost King reports

562
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,840
that over the past month,

563
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:07,880
the Insect King has lost its vitality

564
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,010
and is barely alive.

565
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:12,680
Only the Heaven-Earth Pool
behind the Insect Valley of the Tang Sect

566
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,010
can revitalize it.

567
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:17,450
The Tang Sect never allows outsiders
into the Insect Valley.

568
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:18,850
If we rush in recklessly,

569
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,680
we might hurt the Insect King
and ruin everything.

570
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,970
On the Night of Yin-Hai,

571
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,670
the Tang Sect
will compete for the position of Master,

572
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:27,400
which might cause them to open
the Insect Valley.

573
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:29,050
When taking risky measures,

574
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,570
you must be extremely cautious

575
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,420
and must not offend Old Madam Tang.

576
00:40:35,690 --> 00:40:36,420
Understood.

577
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:38,660
I won't fail your trust, Chief.

578
00:40:43,300 --> 00:40:45,960
Is there still something
you're worried about?

579
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,370
The Wudang Sect, the Shaolin Sect,

580
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:51,280
and other sects in the martial world are
seeking revenge against us.

581
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,200
Quite a few bases
of the Power Gang have been destroyed.

582
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,120
Now, Zhu the Great King
from the Long River waterways

583
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,720
has suddenly risen to power.

584
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,120
I feel something fishy about this.

585
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,530
The Falconry Whistle probably wants

586
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:07,730
far more than just to stir up trouble
in the martial world.

587
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:12,490
This mastermind
wants to challenge our Power Gang.

588
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,640
Then let's see what he's got.
