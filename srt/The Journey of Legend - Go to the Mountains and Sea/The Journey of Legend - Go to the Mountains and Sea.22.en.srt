Li Chenzhou, Liu Suifeng,

5
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,080
you two are not half bad.

00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,440
But unfortunately,

7
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,039
it is all too late.

8
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,289
The martial world is already in chaos.

9
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,320
I've made proper arrangements
for the Northern Wasteland.

10
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,200
Everything is under my control.

11
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,199
However resourceful you are,

12
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,160
you'll never figure out why I can
always get one step ahead of you.

15
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,970
Big Brother, you're finally back.

16
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,650
Just now, you...

17
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,280
You've regained all your martial strength!

18
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,329
Big Brother!

19
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,920
Are you okay?

20
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,770
If you had hit me any harder,

21
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,320
I wouldn't be okay at all.

22
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,640
Yuhan,

23
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,880
Big Brother's meridians
have truly fully recovered.

24
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,320
Even his internal energy
has increased significantly.

25
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,120
This is great.

26
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,240
Guys,

27
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,130
thank you so much

28
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
for taking care of me in recent days.

Mr. Liang,

34
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,090
Grand Master Dayin,

35
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,370
Thank you two for your help.

36
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,200
Now, I'm all fine.

37
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,760
Mr. Xiao,

38
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,660
are you still feeling off
about your meridians?

39
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,960
No, I don't think there's a problem.

40
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,260
Master, maybe you can check my pulse.

41
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,560
Congratulations, Mr. Xiao.

42
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:18,760
Your meridians

43
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,540
are even smoother and stronger
now than before.

44
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:24,760
There is a powerful stream
of internal energy within you.

45
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,040
You must've had many adventures

46
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,810
after I gave you acupuncture therapy.

47
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,290
Grand Master Dayin,

48
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,680
actually, I got that energy
from the Infinite Pill.

49
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,360
Surprisingly, after Shao Liulei forced me
to take that pill,

50
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,120
I attained a surge of energy
that amounted to 60 years of practice.

51
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,850
Big Brother,

52
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,540
you ate the Infinite Pill?

53
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,120
That explains why I was shocked
by your internal energy just now.

54
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,840
What an incredible experience
you had, Big Brother.

55
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,800
Where is Shao Liulei then?

56
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,280
He is dead now.

57
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,920
The Infinite Pill fell in
the hands of 3 people:

58
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,520
Crazy Yan, Shao Liulei, and me.

59
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,640
Not only has the Power Gang
been trying to claim it,

60
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,100
but also Zhu the Great King

61
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,560
has been looking for this pill.

62
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,810
Zhu the Great King is involved too?

63
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:30,920
It seems things are about to get chaotic.

64
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:34,760
Wudang Sect and Shaolin Sect will see
the Power Gang as their arch enemy.

65
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,960
In order to dominate the martial world,

66
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,640
the Power Gang
will be even more unscrupulous.

67
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,100
The Power Gang
has never stopped doing evil.

68
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,400
I believe that one day,

69
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,760
they will be eliminated

70
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,640
by the righteous members
of the martial world.

71
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,240
Qiushui,

72
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,640
though you have
stronger internal energy now,

73
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,200
you're not skilled in martial arts yet.

74
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:58,440
You need to stay humble
and continue your sword practice.

75
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,920
Just wait for the right time
to take revenge.

76
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,370
Don't worry, Mr. Liang.

77
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,100
That's what I'm thinking too.

78
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,640
Mr. Xiao,

79
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,800
you saved my life.

80
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,440
Destiny has brought us together.

81
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,320
I'd like to teach you

82
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,200
the Energy Taming Technique,

83
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,200
which I'm best at.

84
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,840
If you regulate your breathing and power
with this technique,

85
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,170
you'll become better at
controlling your internal energy.

86
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,050
Thank you, Grand Master Dayin.

87
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,280
Terrific.

88
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,960
Now that Qiushui is back,

89
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,000
let's have a celebration tonight.

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,800
Mr. Liang,

91
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,280
I appreciate your kindness.

92
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,730
But there's no need for a celebration.

93
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,680
I ended Kang Chuyu's life

94
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,400
with my very own hands.

95
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,680
Guys,

96
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,880
we've finally avenged Tang Rou.

97
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,800
Great.

98
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,880
Tang Rou can finally
rest in peace, Big Brother.

99
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,360
Finally, we took revenge for Tang Rou.

100
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,490
I only regret
that I didn't get to help with it.

101
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,440
Oh, right.

102
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,000
I found this on Kang Chuyu.

103
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,800
I suspect he was somehow
connected to the Power Gang.

104
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,200
See what you can find out.

105
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,409
Okay. We'll take care of it.

106
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,740
Stay cautious.

107
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,800
Mr. Xiao,

108
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,800
something has been puzzling me.

109
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,800
I had been to the Sword Manor.

110
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,400
It was impenetrable.

111
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,960
How did it end up being broken?

112
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,290
What exactly happened?

113
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,480
Has the truth been revealed yet?

114
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:11,700
That day, we were besieged
by the Power Gang.

115
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,890
With the solid Sword Manor's help,

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,260
we could have held out.

117
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,520
But the loyal Mr. Qiu

118
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,400
suddenly turned against us.

119
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,300
He poisoned the water sources in secret,

120
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,560
so our water supply was cut off.

121
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,100
Staying in the Sword Manor

122
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,010
was equal to waiting for death.

123
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,620
Given that, my parents

124
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:44,760
chose to give
their chance of survival to us.

125
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,260
This is what they said,

126
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,680
"Son,

127
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,160
get out of this place at all costs.

128
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,810
Make sure you keep yourself safe."

129
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,050
But by the time we returned,

130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
the Sword Manor had already fallen.

131
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,800
I couldn't find my parents' bodies.

132
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,920
Xueyu set up cenotaphs for them.

133
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,960
I also find Mr. Qiu's betrayal odd.

134
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,120
I once paid a visit to Xilou years ago.

135
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,610
Mr. Qiu was the one who received me.

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
He had no desire and was all alone.

137
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,610
Neither did he have any family
to be threatened with.

138
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,840
Why would he suddenly
switch to the Power Gang's side?

139
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,080
It's said that the Power Gang

140
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,340
owns an evil thing called the Misery Pill

141
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,560
that plunges people into abject suffering.

142
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,160
They use that to coerce the righteous
into betrayal and submission.

143
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,000
That's what
makes the Power Gang invincible,

144
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,060
and as influential as they are today.

145
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,660
The Misery Pill...

146
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,800
Betrayal and submission...

147
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,120
Mr. Liang,

148
00:09:58,840 --> 00:09:59,970
Grand Master Dayin,

149
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,840
after hearing what you two said,

150
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,460
it suddenly occurred to me

151
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,340
that Mr. Qiu might have been harmed
that way.

152
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,720
How about

153
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,240
we examine his body now?

154
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:13,480
Okay.

155
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:16,320
Beware of the toxins from the corpse.

156
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,520
Hold your breath now.

157
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,020
So the culprit was this thing.

158
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,880
It's a Death Beetle
produced by the Ghost King.

159
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,320
I bet the Misery Pill
is hidden inside this Death Beetle.

160
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,600
You're right.

161
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,440
This Death Beetle is a living creature.

162
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,040
When it crawls into a person's body,
carrying the Misery Pill,

163
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,500
the Power Gang
can badly torture this person

164
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,120
by controlling the Death Beetle.

165
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,540
So, whether this person
attempts to survive

166
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,090
or to relieve himself
of agony through death,

167
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,410
he's bound to be used by the Power Gang.

168
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,410
I think all the righteous sects

169
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,080
should assemble and unite immediately.

170
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,200
Otherwise,
they'll be conquered one by one.

171
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,360
The Power Gang use such beetles
to manipulate people.

172
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,320
How horrifying.

173
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,080
I can't imagine

174
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,800
how many other people
will fall victims the same way.

175

with all our might.

specially for you.

Thank you.

220
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:29,400
It does cost a lot

221
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,360

Renovating buildings,
reforging iron tools, regrouping forces...

223
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,240

239
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,570
but then awakened from a dream.

240
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,300

245
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,480
I was with my birth parents.

In a spacious courtyard,

247
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,940
I would fly kites with my brother.

248
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,080

249
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,160
Indeed.

250
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,130
You parted with your birth parents
at a young age.

251
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:53,940
But since you came to the Xiao family,

252
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:56,370

253
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:57,840

257
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,160

out loud to one another.

259
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,730
However, since that misfortune
befell the Xiao family,

260
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,980
everyone has become too anxious.

261
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,240

262
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,440

263

264
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,410
no matter what happens,

265
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,520
the fact that we are family

266
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,920
will never change.

267
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,760

I didn't mean to lash out at Qiushui.

271
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,680
By the time I reopened the family's door
that day,

272
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,880
I had suffered enough
contempt and humiliation.

273
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,880
But he had the gall

274
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,780
to accuse me of cashing in past favors
to milk benefits.

275
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,600

276

for family members to bicker, right?

282
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:15,119

284
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,400
Enough.

Besides,

290
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,640
he's not a child anymore.

291
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,800

What?

326
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,920
Tang Sect usually holds such a ceremony
in the middle of the month.

327
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:38,400
Why did they choose
the beginning of the month this time?

Hello, Mr. Xiao.

335
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,290
We showed up uninvited,

336
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,040

338
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,280

Don't say that.

Many from the martial sects
have come to watch the ceremony.

341
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,260
I shouldn't have negligently

342

344
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,180

345
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,680

On this joyous occasion,

347
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,020
I'd like to ask you a question.

348
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,760
Usually, Tang Sect holds
such an ancestral worship ceremony

349
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,560
on the fifteenth day of the month.

350
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,080
What made you suddenly host one today?

351
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,330
I just did what I was instructed to.

352
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,720
How am I supposed to know

353
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,480
why the elders made this decision?

354
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,610
Tang Sect has always kept a low profile

355
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,320
and seldom held gatherings.

356
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,040
But now, you've invited so many guests
to this grand ancestral worship ceremony.

357
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,960
Is it your master's idea?

358
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,520
Or did he deliberately schedule for this

359
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,780
to knowingly mess with

360
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,140
our fund raising event today?

361
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,040
Mr. Xiao, are you blaming me?

362
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,140
I didn't know
you had plans to raise funds today.

363
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,530
Suppose I did pick today for the ceremony,

364
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,960
you wouldn't have the guts
to disrupt it, would you?

365
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,360
You...

366
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:28,720
Fine.

367
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,850
The Xiao family will not forget

368
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,780
Tang Sect's hostility today.

369
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,840
By the way,

370
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,680
since the Xiao family
can barely sustain itself now,

371
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,940
all the disciples studying at your place

372
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:42,370
will be taken over by Tang Sect
from now on.

373
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:43,560
Boys!

374
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,400
Uncle Xiao is leaving.

375
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,820
Aren't you going to bid him farewell?

376
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,920
Goodbye, Uncle Xiao.

377
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,760
How dare you raid
our martial training hall?

378
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,080
Ungrateful punks!

379
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:05,300
We're not cutting ties
with the Xiao family!

380
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,640
The Xiao family has fallen from grace.

381
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,040
You can't even
make a few young trainees stay.

382
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,400
All I can say is that times have changed.

383
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,160
We've won over everyone.

384
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,240
Xiao Yiren,

385
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:34,340
trying to bluff
and intimidate others again

386
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,840
will only turn you into a laughing stock.

387
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,280
You...

388
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,810
You can't even
make a few young trainees stay.

389
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,840
What a disgrace!

390
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,570
You're inviting humiliation!

391
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,120
You've all used the land
of the Xiao family,

392
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,040
and benefited
from the Xiao family's generosity.

393
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:55,240
How could you turn on who has helped you?

394
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,040
Now, these lands no longer
belong to the Xiao family.

395
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,600
What's the point
of harping on the tiny favors

396
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,960
you did us before?

397
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,130
Butler Nangong,
I can't believe you're here too!

398
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,140
Mr. Nangong is absolutely right.

399
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,080
Now, the land
on which we train our members

400
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,010
is leased from the Nangong family,

401
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,960
and has nothing to do
with the Xiao family anymore.

402
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,480
So now you have

403
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,280
all the small plots of land I sold?

404
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,080
That's right.

405
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:28,680
Now, the Nangong family and Tang Sect
are two strong forces in alliance.

406
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,960
From now all, all the affairs

407
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,530
in the Jindu martial community
will be handled by us.

408
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,960
It's time for the Xiao family,
which leads Huanhua Sect, to stop

409
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,920
clinging to its past glory!

410
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,240
-Yeah!
-Be realistic!

411
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,200
Go away!

412
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,300
Tang Sect and our family used to be

413
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,040
two equally strong powers in Jindu.

414
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,600
They already antagonized us at that time!

415
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,960
Now, our family has
just come crushing down,

416
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,880
they're already colluding with
the Nangong family

417
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,160
to take our people and land away!

418
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,720
Aren't they obviously trying to

419
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,250
to devour our family's resources
all at once?

420
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,280
Tang Sect's enmity is no surprise to me.

421
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,560
I just didn't expect the Nangong family

422
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,610
would discard our old friendship.

423
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,220
Tang Song sure is detestable,

424
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,680
but he did say something right just now.

425
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,600
Times have changed.

426
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,400
Back then, when the Nangong family
tried to gain a foothold in Jindu,

427
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,080
they had to rely on us, the Xiao family.

428
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,880
But today, we the Xiao family are

429
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,800
in need of the Nangong family's help.

430
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,400
However, the Nangong family

431
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,880
has now allied with
the powerful Tang Sect.

432
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,160
They'd just despise us even more,
wouldn't they?

433
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,680
They both specialize in the same field.

434
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,360
There is competition between them.

435
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:10,960
Perhaps

436
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,940
they're not as united as they appear.

437
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:17,440
Besides, we go way back
with the Nangong family.

438
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,240
If I drop my pride, cooperate with them,

439
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,760
and help them achieve their ambitions,

440
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,760
maybe they'll consider being our aide.

441
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,040
It's time to take action. You go home now.

442
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,170
Wait to hear from me.

443
00:25:42,130 --> 00:25:43,620
[Nangong Residence]

444
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,120
How dare you disobey me!

445
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,120
No more dodging!

446
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,360
Kneel! On your knees!

447
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:49,770
Trying to dodge?

448
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:50,960
On your knees!

449
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,850
I'll beat you up!

450
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,040
Kneel!

451
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:58,600
Dodging?

452
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,720
Again?

453
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,370
This will teach you!

454
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,760
And you!

455
00:26:05,810 --> 00:26:07,470
[Nangong Wushang]

456
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,360
Sect Leader Xiao.

457
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,040
Mr. Nangong.

458
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,360
Pardon me for being blunt.

459
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,520
I came here

460
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,160
with the hope of getting help

461
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,440
from the Nangong family,

462
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,080
for the sake of the friendship
between our two families,

463
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,680
so I can revive Huanhua Sect.

464
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,800
When the Xiao family returns to glory,

465
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:28,840
I promise that in Jindu,

466
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,930
he who knows the Xiao family

467
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,560
will also know the Nangong family.

468
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,620
How kind of you to say that.

469
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,560
In the Xiao family, you're the only

470
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,640
extraordinary martial fighter.

471
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,400
By contrast, Tang Sect is flourishing

472
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,920
and showing great momentum.

473
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:44,680
Why should the Nangong family
ally with the Xiao family?

474
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,800
It's true that Tang Sect is powerful now,

475
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,960
but people's minds
change every now and then.

476
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,160
Maybe their strength
will turn into a hinderance one day.

477
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,850
Our two families
have been friends for years.

478
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,420
Aren't we more reliable than outsiders?

479
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,800
By that logic,

480
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,130
the Nangong family is not exactly closely

481
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,930
bound with the Xiao family.

482
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,850
Mr. Xiao, how can you guarantee

483
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,440
the Xiao family is reliable?

484
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:12,810
Wushang's concerns

485
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,650
are indeed reasonable.

486
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,480
-Mr. Nangong.
-Brother.

487
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,490
This is not an unsolvable problem.

488
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,280
If the Xiao family
is genuinely sincere about this,

489
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,320
I don't mind deepening the bond

490
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,580
between our two families.

491
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,880
Xiaoyi

492
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,800
is even closer to the Xiao family
than to us.

493
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,530
I suggest Xueyu marry into our family.

494
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,160
Xueyu?

495
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,280
No.

496
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,000
Marriage is a lifelong commitment,

497
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,400
which should be based on mutual affection.

498
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,530
How can it be used as a bargaining chip?

499
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,540
Then I don't think
the Xiao family is being sincere.

500
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,720
How can you expect us to help you?

501
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,160
But this shouldn't be

502
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,660
my sister's responsibility, right?

503
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:03,960
Fine.

504
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,400
You'd hate to maintain the ties
through marriage, right?

505
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,480
Then send the Xiao family's sword manual

506
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,840
to the Nangong family.

507
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,130
I'll keep it for you.

508
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,880
Then, I'll lend you a helping hand.

509
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,170
You mean Huanhua Sword Manual?

510
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,320
No way!

511
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,360
It's the treasure of the Xiao family,

512
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,120
and the lifeblood of Huanhua Sect.

513
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,440
How can I give it away?

514
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,330
You refused every request.

515
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,120
Do you want the Nangong family
to beg you instead?

516
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,280
I came here to ask for help

517
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:42,600
in good faith.

518
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,680
Never did I expect the Nangong family
to be so aggressive.

519
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,930
This conversation ends here then.

520
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,740
Show yourself out now.

521
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,000
Fine.

522
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,200
Goodbye!

523
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,410
Once you walk out that door,

524
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,200
the Power Gang and Tang Sect
won't the only two institutes

525
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,860
attempting to wipe the Xiao family
out of Jindu.

526
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,330
The Nangong family
always gets what it wants.

527
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,480
Thereafter, the Xiao family will no longer
have a place in the martial world.

528
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,410
You're choosing to
ruin the century-old foundation

529
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,720

With Liu Suifeng going down,

719
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,080
Qu Hanshan thought he'd become

720
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:17,880
the deputy chief.

721
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,720
However, in the end,
he didn't get that satisfaction.

722
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:21,320
He must be furious right now.

723
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,400
Although we haven't

724
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,960
located the Power Gang's headquarters,

725
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,480
someone has revealed Qu Hanshan's address.

726
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,220
He's living in the nearby Tongfu Street.

727
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:33,040
Liu Suifeng and Qu Hanshan
have always been at odds.

728
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,530
It's time we took

729
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,080
advantage of the rivalry between them.

730
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,970
Big Brother,

731
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,960
suppose Qu Hanshan

732
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,040
did collude with the Northern Wasteland,

733
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,800
he must be feeling antsy now,

734
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,880
as the Power Gang
is trying hard to catch moles.

735
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,760
You're right.

736
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,720
People make bad decisions in desperation.

737
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,600
This time,

738
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:03,440
I'm going to trick him.

739
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,660
Take a look. High-quality products.

740
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,480
Any different patterns?

741
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,580
Just a sec. I'll show you some.

742
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,540
How about this one?

743
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,220
Master.

744
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,840
Has Kang Chuyu come back?

745
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:33,880
Where has he gone?

746
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,570
The Sword King's mansion
is heavily guarded.

747
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,260
I need to find a way to sneak in.

748
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,760
This guy looks like Li Cai. How come?

749
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,360
I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry.
