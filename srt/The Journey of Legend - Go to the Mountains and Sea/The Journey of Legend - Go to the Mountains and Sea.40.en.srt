1
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,680
The Northern Wasteland army is attacking.

2
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,150
General,

3
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,120
what should we do?

4
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,000
Send word to the court
and the general immediately

5
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,030
to report the crisis at Immortal Pass.

6
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,560
Yes, sir.

7
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,630
Daxi and the Northern Wasteland
has agreed to peace talks.

8
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:16,030
Why have you broken your promise

9
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,520
and gone back on your word?

10
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,560
A nobody like you

11
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,630
is not worthy to speak with me.

12
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,870
The agreement was made with Wu Jie.

13
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,870
Now that he's gone,

14
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,190
the agreement naturally becomes void!

15
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,360
The general hasn't returned,

16
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,360
and we haven't received the order.

17
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,620
What are we going to do?

18
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,079
Behind the Immortal Pass

19
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:35,840
lies the heartland of Daxi.

20
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:37,630
Our fathers, mothers,
and loved ones are there.

21
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,470
Even if we die,

22
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:41,280
we cannot let the Northern Wastelanders
through the pass.

23
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,120
We must hold the gates at all costs.

24
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,120
Defend! Defend! Defend!

25
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,910
Attack!

26
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,079
Kill!

27
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,120
Kill!

28
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,430
Kill!

29
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,430
Attack!

30
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:36,880
Where is General Wu?

31
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,720
He's still fine for now.

32
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,190
But who knows for how much longer?

33
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:46,950
Qiushui.

34
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,050
The moment
you stepped into this camp,

35
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,870
you've sent him to his grave.

36
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,510
Don't you think you're so capable,

37
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,040
wanting to be a hero
who saves the country and its people?

38
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,370
Today, I'll tell you...

39
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,310
You won't accomplish anything.

40
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,120
Where is General Wu?

41
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,600
Do you think you can beat me?

42
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,560
Winning or losing doesn't matter.

43
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,720
Tell me where General Wu is.

44
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,870
Why the rush?

45
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:51,080
We don't have much time left
for General Wu.

46
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,950
If you defeat me,

47
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,360
I'll tell you.

48
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,120
General! General! General!

49
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,000
Terrible news!

50
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,260
Ambushers are attacking the inner city!

51
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,470
General!

52
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,280
General,

53
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,920
the city gates have been breached!

54
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
Fall back to defend the inner city!

55
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,190
Kill!

56
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,630
Kill!

57
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:50,360
Kill!

58
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:56,310
Xiao Kaiyan.

59
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,210
It's time to end things for you.

60
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:09,960
Another stroke of luck?

61
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:54,510
You think you've won.

62
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,550
Xiao Qiushui.

63
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:00,720
You want to save General Wu,

64
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,750
but I refuse to tell you.

65
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,080
What can you do about it?

66
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,870
Hand over General Wu.

67
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,270
Kaiyan.

68
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,120
Kaiyan.

69
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:38,720
Father?

70
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:39,870
Father.

71
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,480
Kaiyan,

72
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,600
among my three children,

73
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,360
you are the most reliable.

74
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,240
Since Huanhua has you,

75
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,440
I can rest easy.

76
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,630
Father.

77
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,080
Kaiyan,

78
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,770
why are you back so late?

79
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,720
Are you hungry?

80
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,550
What would you like to eat?

81
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,280
I'll make it for you right away.

82
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:03,200
Mother!

83
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,870
Mother, Yiren!

84
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,510
Kaiyan,

85
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,440
I got you a good sword.

86
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:11,770
Come take a look!

87
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:18,720
Kaiyan.

88
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,720
Kaiyan,

89
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,360
we agreed to venture
into the martial world together.

90
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,440
Let's go now.

91
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,720
Xiao Qiushui!

92
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,080
Xiao Qiushui!

93
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,840
You took shortcuts,

94
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,200
absorbing others' energy,

95
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,720
which led you astray

96
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,750
and killed so many innocent people.

97
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
When there is no self in one's heart,

98
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,840
only then can you understand
heaven and earth.

99
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,630
By showing compassion for others,

100
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,360
only then can you connect with
all living beings.

101
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:33,970
You've only ever seen yourself
in your eyes.

102
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,170
How could you possibly understand

103
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:40,550
that the highest state of Voidheart

104
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,550
is actually compassion?

105
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,480
Qiushui.

106
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,240
I see...

107
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,600
it's snowing.

108
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,010
Second Brother.

109
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,830
This is the last time I'll call you that.

110
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,200
I'm the only one left in the Xiao family.

111
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,510
I will now make amends

112
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,670
for the mistakes you made.

113
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,510
Tell me

114
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,750
where General Wu is.

115
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,720
Tell me

116
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,510
where General Wu is!

117
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,440
General Wu...

118
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,840
Is...

119
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,000
Is...

120
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:34,600
The outcome is decided.

121
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:36,080
Immortal Pass

122
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:39,060
already belongs to the Northern Wasteland.

123
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,270
Your desperate struggle

124
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,630
will only lead to death.

125
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,550
We swear to defend Daxi to the death,

126
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,480
unwavering in our commitment!

127
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,320
-Unwavering commitment!
-Unwavering commitment!

128
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,250
-Unwavering commitment!
-Unwavering commitment!

129
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,840
You're nothing but

130
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,630
Wu Jie's remnant forces.

131
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,000
Damn Northern Wastelanders,

132
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,390
get out of Daxi!

133
00:16:58,390 --> 00:16:59,910
-Get out of Daxi!
-Get out of Daxi!

134
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,390
-Get out of Daxi!
-Get out of Daxi!

135
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:03,240
-Get out of Daxi!
-Get out of Daxi!

136
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,069
Foolish commoners blind to the times,

137
00:17:05,069 --> 00:17:07,800
even Daxi's emperor
is willing to cede territory

138
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,160
for temporary peace!

139
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,950
Will anyone come to save you?

140
00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:14,109
Move aside or I'll kill you all.

141
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:28,960
I, Liang Dou, have brought
Daxi's martial world

142
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,070
to guard the nation's gate.

143
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:32,720
I'd like to see

144
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,200
whether Daxi's martial world is formidable

145
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,000
or if the Northern Wasteland's experts

146
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,070
are more superior.

147
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:38,920
Attack!

148
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:20,310
Qiushui.

149
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:28,440
General!

150
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,960
It's the General!

151
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,400
All soldiers, hear my command!

152
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:06,200
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

153
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,440
Follow me
and fight our way out of the city!

154
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:33,880
Charge!

155
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:09,680
Charge!

156
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:24,830
Guards,

157
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,440
summon Li Chenzhou.

158
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,030
Tell him to rescue
General Wu at all costs!

159
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,110
Your Majesty!

160
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:31,880
Great victory!

161
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,150
Your Majesty.

162
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,110
Your Majesty,

163
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,030
victory at Immortal Pass!

164
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:38,830
Your Majesty,

165
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,350
in the battle at Immortal Pass,

166
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,880
Wu Jie defeated
the Northern Wasteland Army!

167
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,550
The Northern Wasteland Army's general,

168
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,680
Helian Yan, was beheaded.

169
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,200
The Northern Wasteland has surrendered

170
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,460
and promised not to invade
the Central Plains for 50 years!

171
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,400
Good.

172
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,680
Very good!

173
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,880
Issue the order:

174
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,680
Reward Wu Jie
and the frontline soldiers generously.

175
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,160
Yes, Your Majesty.

176
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:58,790
Wait.

177
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:00,920
And Chenzhou

178
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,730
should be rewarded too.

179
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,510
Your Majesty,

180
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,480
Chief Li has already...

181
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,920
While searching for General Wu,

182
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,920
he died.

183
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,810
What did you say?

184
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:23,680
Chenzhou...

185
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:13,830
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

186
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:16,030
General Wu.

187
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:29,270
The Xiao family honors promises.
You risked your life to save me.

188
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:31,920
I will never forget
this debt of gratitude.

189
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,350
Come.

190
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,070
Drink!

191
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,260
Let me drink first to show my respect!

192
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,070
Come, I'll join you.

193
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,240
Good wine!

194
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,720
Wu Army!

195
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:52,070
Here!

196
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:53,000
Here!

197
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:53,960
Here!

198
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,550
Mr. Xiao,

199
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,610
on behalf of the entire Wu Army,

200
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,510
I toast to
your Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood!

201
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,030
Cheers!

202
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,000
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

203
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,510
Bottoms up!

204
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,200
Bottoms up!

205
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,920
Cheers!

206
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,580
Bottoms up!

207
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,680
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

208
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,000
Such good wine!

209
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,150
Let's drink till we drop.

210
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,000
Cheers!

211
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:41,590
Come!

212
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:43,480
Brothers.

213
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:47,480
This cup

214
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,160
is to all our brothers
who died fighting the Northern Wasteland.

215
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,090
Today's victory

216
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,080
is partly theirs as well.

217
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:14,350
This one...

218
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,810
Let's drink to ourselves.

219
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,750
To ourselves!

220
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,720
-Good!
-Drink!

221
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,480
To ourselves!

222
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:32,000
To ourselves!

223
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:32,880
Come!

224
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:33,790
Come!

225
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,550
- Go.
- Go.

226
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,510
Let's go drink over there.

227
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,550
Let's drink with those guys.

228
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,080
Let's go.

229
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,440
I'm telling you all,

230
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,750
we're no longer the Four Thugs.

231
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,680
We're now the Five Thugs...

232
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,030
Five, Six Thugs now!

233
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:05,920
We were like this and then like that.

234
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,510
Drink!

235
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,370
No one leaves sober!

236
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:18,680
Come on, drink up!

237
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,880
Come on, have a drink!

238
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,960
Here, pour some more.

239
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,830
Come on.

240
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:23,640
Good.

241
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Great tolerance!

242
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,510
Here, like this, and again.

243
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:48,310
Tang Fang.

244
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,480
Qiushui.

245
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,640
Knowing you
is the greatest joy of my life.

246
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:29,960
Your family master

247
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,480
doesn't allow women to marry out.

248
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,480
Then can you have a husband marry in?

249
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,110
Well...

250
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,180
A live-in son-in-law?

251
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,200
Big Brother, Second, Fourth Brothers,
come here quick.

252
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,750
Zuoqiu is going to be
a live-in son-in-law!

253
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:41,920
Zuoqiu is marrying into the Qu family!

254
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:44,510
Will their children
have to take the Qu surname?

255
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:45,310
That's fine.

256
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,400
What's wrong with the Qu surname?

257
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,720
I'm not jealous at all.

258
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,400
We have Fifth Thug.

259
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,880
We'll live together
with Fifth Thug from now on.

260
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,550
Right, we'll live with Fifth Thug.

261
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:55,070
Won't that make us five bachelors?

262
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,720
Five bachelors it is then.

263
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:01,550
Fourth Brother,
you're not stuttering anymore.

264
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,440
You're right.

265
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:04,510
Come on, drink more.

266
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:06,240
Big Brother.

267
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:07,270
Miss Tang.

268
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:09,160
Let's enjoy the wine while we can.

269
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,290
Let me toast you two.

270
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,480
This feels great.

271
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,640
Who says our Fifth Thug must be bachelors?

272
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:35,790
I'm not.

273
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,080
Everything for Daxi.

274
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:39,680
Each of them

275
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,070
is a great hero of Daxi.

276
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,750
Qiushui!

277
00:29:59,070 --> 00:29:59,720
Miss Tang.

278
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,230
I'd like to toast you two.

279
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:04,310
May you enjoy your drinks!

280
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,910
I'll drink up.

281
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,680
Qiushui,

282
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:15,110
on such a wonderful day,

283
00:30:15,110 --> 00:30:17,200
let's sing a song together!

284
00:30:18,270 --> 00:30:18,800
Alright!

285
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
Brothers.

286
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,480
Let's sing together now.

287
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,680
Time to sing.

288
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,400
You start first.

289
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,460
-You start.
-Sure!

290
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,960
Xiao Qiushui,

291
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,310
you've won.

292
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,540
The martial world,

293
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,690
at the end of the day,
is united by righteousness.

294
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,830
I see a different martial world too.

295
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,270
Xiao Qiushui.

296
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,560
We'll meet
when fate brings us together again.

297
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,670
Qiushui knew well

298
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,150
that using the Voidheart Codex

299
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,030
at the 15th level
would have consequences.

300
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,230
Although it could unleash

301
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,510
power several times
beyond his own strength,

302
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:00,570
making him temporarily invincible,

303
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,230
it would drain
his vital energy completely,

304
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,400
damaging his meridians
and depleting his life force soon after.

305
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,630
He paid with his life!

306
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,880
Mingming, after thorough investigation,

307
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,760
we've confirmed
Li Nan's espionage activities.

308
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,630
He was acting under orders
from a foreign spy organization

309
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,960
to steal state secrets.

310
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,760
Unfortunately,
before he could be sentenced,

311
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,630
he died two days ago.
