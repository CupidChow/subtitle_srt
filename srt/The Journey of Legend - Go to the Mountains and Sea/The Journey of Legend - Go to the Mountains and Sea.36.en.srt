[The Journey of Legend]

2
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,930
[Episode 36]

3
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,920
This cloak...

4
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,810
This cloak belonged to my sister Yuan.

5
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,040
Senior.

6
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,710
There were too many people around earlier,

7
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,240
so I didn't have a chance
to return it to you.

8
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,150
Old Madam Wu

9
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,400
and Sect Leader Zhichen

10
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,660
entrusted me to give it to you.

11
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,750
Sect Leader Zhichen once mentioned

12
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,640
that back then, your sister

13
00:02:33,710 --> 00:02:35,770
was kidnapped by the Jiang brothers.

14
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,680
During her escape,

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,680
she unfortunately contracted
a serious illness.

16
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,310
Fortunately, Sect Leader Zhichen

17
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,520
happened to pass by
and was able to save her.

18
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,380
But after that,

19
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,840
there was no more news of her.

20
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,750
It was all my fault.

21
00:03:15,470 --> 00:03:17,000
This is the greatest regret

22
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,000
of my entire life.

23
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,380
[Tang Yaoshun]

24
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,760
The Tang Sect is already under my control.

25
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,870
Xiao Qiushui,

26
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,120
how will you respond to this?

27
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,870
Sancai has sent word that

28
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,000
General Wu will immediately

29
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,030
return to the capital
after receiving the imperial order.

30
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:06,760
Big Brother.

31
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,710
If General Wu leaves the Immortal Pass,

32
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:10,520
what if the Northern Wasteland
seizes the chance to attack?

33
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,250
Wouldn't that be a big problem?

34
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,870
Not only that,

35
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,980
General Wu might also face danger

36
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:18,970
on his way back to the capital.

37
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,720
So we need to act quickly.

38
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,040
Any delay

39
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:25,440
will put General Wu in greater danger.

40
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,760
We've all been investigating separately,

41
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:29,870
and we've found some

42
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:33,670
suspicious locations related to
the falconry whistle activities.

43
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:39,470
Assemble people
to investigate immediately.

44
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,040
Okay.

45
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,920
Search carefully!

46
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,600
-Yes!
-Yes!

47
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:17,870
Yuhan.

48
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:18,510
Guys.

49
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:19,870
The outpost over there

50
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,590
has been cleared by the Power Gang.

51
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,510
-How about here?
-That's great.

52
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,870
This must be the Falconry Whistle hideout.

53
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,720
At least the Power Gang
knows better this time.

54
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,360
Hope they cooperate with us properly
this time

55
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,560
to catch those spies.

56
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,850
Since Big Brother trusts them,

57
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,580
let's do it.

58
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:32,600
Let's go!

59
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,570
Let's go.

60
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,430
It's cooled down.

61
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,200
Chief, is your old injury

62
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:00,270
flaring up again?

63
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,070
It's not that.

64
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,480
He's simply unaware of his age

65
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,580
and has been wearing himself out

66
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,710
with constant work.

67
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,440
Now that you're down,

68
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,070
all the sect affairs, big and small,

69
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,870
have all fallen on my shoulders.

70
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,600
How's the situation over there?

71
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,430
Xiao Kaiyan has been using
the Twelve Serial Docks

72
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,120
as his base.

73
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,630
The waterways are interconnected,

74
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:26,510
and the hidden water networks
are extremely complex.

75
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,480
We haven't found anything conclusive yet.

76
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,240
Then send more people there.

77
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,430
Yes.

78
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:35,270
This is the information
that Song Mingzhu and others

79
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,720
intercepted from Falconry Whistle.

80
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,480
"20,000 elite soldiers will take
the water route,

81
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,920
bypass the Immortal Pass to head south,

82
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,780
and infiltrate Daxi to launch
a coordinated strike

83
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,360
from inside and out."

84
00:06:57,830 --> 00:07:01,120
If the Northern Wastelanders
really succeed in crossing south,

85
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,720
it would utterly crush

86
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,680
the people's confidence
in resisting the Northern Wasteland.

87
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,830
The Northern Wasteland is feigning peace,

88
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,160
while secretly amassing
200,000 soldiers ready to strike.

89
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,680
The court has summoned General Wu back,

90
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,720
and morale at Immortal Pass is crumbling.

91
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,780
The martial world is also in turmoil,

92
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,120
and worse, some treacherous people,
bribed by the waterways,

93
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,160
have gone so far as to commit treason
by colluding with the enemy.

94
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,240
We must ensure General Wu's safety

95
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,160
to stabilize the war situation.

96
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,510
If he returns to the capital,

97
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:32,270
I fear the Immortal Pass will fall.

98
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,470
If he doesn't return,

99
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,930
he'll be charged with fabricated crimes.

100
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,360
If you report to His Majesty

101
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,000
about the waterways' collusion
with the Northern Wasteland,

102
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,830
could it soften the court's stance?

103
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,210
Suifeng,

104
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,870
gather more men

105
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,310
to eliminate Falconry Whistle's base

106
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,310
and block the Northern Wasteland's
elite troops from advancing south.

107
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,270
Yes.

108
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,960
I wish I could share more of your burden.

109
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,270
I heard the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood

110
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:11,240
is also trying to eliminate
Falconry Whistle's base.

111
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,120
Daxi

112
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,630
has finally come to such a state.

113
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,720
Master.

114
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:25,380
I have a feeling that
something's off with Chief's health.

115
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
Keep an eye on him.

116
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,720
Mr. Yan.

117
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,870
You should move around less.

118
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:38,440
Here.

119
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,370
Take your medicine first.

120
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,650
Physician Xiao.

121
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:43,320
My injury has already healed.

122
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,790
You need to take time to rest and recover.

123
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,510
As for the Soul-Piercing Nail,

124
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,710
Qiushui and I will have someone
to find another solution.

125
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,090
This little injury is nothing.

126
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,290
Don't make such a fuss.

127
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,020
[Huaiyang]

128
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,750
Chief Li.

129
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,380
What's this supposed to mean?

130
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:44,720
This Chief's Token

131
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,680
is the Power Gang's symbol of authority

132
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,870
and something revered
throughout the martial world.

133
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,250
The reason all sects fear it

134
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,030
is because the Power Gang

135
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,630
holds dirt on every sect, isn't it?

136
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,080
Mr. Xiao, you certainly know how to joke.

137
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,870
Mr. Xiao, it seems

138
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:11,440
you deeply despise our Power Gang.

139
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,510
Relationships built on profit end
when profit does.

140
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,440
Relationships built on influence collapse
when influence fades.

141
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,320
Relationships built on power are abandoned
when power is lost.

142
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,320
Chief Li.

143
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:24,910
Don't you have to use the Misery Pill

144
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:28,430
and the Tribulation Finger
to force people into submission?

145
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,790
Indeed.

146
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,250
But in these chaotic times,

147
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,910
only by wielding powerful measures

148
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:42,310
and clearing all hurdles

149
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,320
can the situation be firmly stabilized

150
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,270
for those who follow.

151
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:49,910
By exchanging hearts with sincerity
and keeping ambitions modest,

152
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,570
true friendship will endure.

153
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:54,630
This is the only way we can rebuild
a new martial world.

154
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:57,600
But your doings
resemble more the tactics of an emperor,

155
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,400
not the way of the martial world.

156
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,500
If that's the case,

157
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,840
then Mr. Xiao,

158
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,400
why don't you just be

159
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:08,640
the successor
who rebuilds the way of the martial world?

160
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,030
As long as one has a chivalrous heart,

161
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:12,760
anyone can become a successor.

162
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,960
Chief Li, you should take

163
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,880
your Chief's Token back.

164
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,030
Though we share the same destination,

165
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,960
we can no longer walk the same path.

166
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,720
I'm going to the capital for an audience
with His Majesty,

167
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,650
and I must take my wine on schedule.

168
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:29,720
Could it be

169
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,440
the wine's poisoned?

170
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,630
The poison has penetrated to
my bones and marrow.

171
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,550
Now

172
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,920
I'm truly gravely ill
and unlikely to recover.

173
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,510
Since you know the wine's poisoned,

174
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:01,080
why do you keep drinking it?

175
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,440
I have no other choice.

176
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,670
I fear not death,

177
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,210
but I really don't know

178
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,250
who else I can give this token to.

179
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,510
Chief Li,

180
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,200
you still don't understand.

181
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,510
The martial world is like
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

182
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,170
Even if I run around shouting,

183
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:39,080
I can only awaken like-minded people.

184
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:41,630
This is not a path of my own making,

185
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:43,760
but the one that meets the hopes of all.

186
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,390
So be it.

187
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,840
The court intends to stop the war,

188
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,670
so they've summoned General Wu
back to the capital.

189
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,870
But now, the Northern Wasteland
has colluded with the waterways

190
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,000
to infiltrate elite troops into Daxi.

191
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,200
I believe this battle is inevitable.

192
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,840
Therefore, we must not let General Wu

193
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,880
leave the Immortal Pass.

194
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,510
Then we must unite

195
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,720
and do everything to rescue General Wu.

196
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:34,670
The martial world
needs no leader hereafter.

197
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
Driven by righteousness or by profit,

198
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,930
everyone has their own choice.

199
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,960
I must not tell Master

200
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,580
about Chief being poisoned.

201
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,320
Master.

202
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,280
Just tell me what you heard.

203
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,070
Chief is going to hand over
the Power Gang to Xiao Qiushui.

204
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:12,630
What else did Chief mention?

205
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,070
Chief also said

206
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:18,730
that the Power Gang's ways are outdated,

207
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:21,320
and he asked Xiao Qiushui
to lead everyone to transform

208
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,720
and integrate into some new martial world.

209
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,870
I really don't understand.

210
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,630
Master, you've been completely loyal
to the Power Gang

211
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,870
and served for so many years.

212
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,800
Master, how could Chief bypass you

213
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:33,910
and pass leadership to an outsider?

214
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,570
Chief wouldn't hand over his position
for no reason.

215
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,910
His actions today

216
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
are very unusual.

217
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,720
Could it be

218
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:53,330
that his condition is as I've feared,

219
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,520
beyond medical help?

220
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,440
M-Master.

221
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:00,910
You already knew?

222
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,770
I want you to go somewhere with me.

223
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,130
I haven't shown my face for years.

224
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,240
A bunch of nobodies
seeking the Voidheart Codex

225
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,840
have all come looking for me.

226
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,930
Unfortunately,

227
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,780
none of them can take a hit.

228
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,480
Over the years in the martial world,

229
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,630
each generation is worse than the last.

230
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,960
It's becoming less and less interesting.

231
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,320
You two,

232
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,950
what exactly do you want?

233
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,880
If you're smart,

234
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,610
have Crazy Yan hand over
the Voidheart Codex!

235
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,320
Cowards.

236
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,270
If you've got the guts,
go see Mr. Yan yourselves.

237
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,910
Going to him is no different from
seeking death.

238
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,030
We're not that stupid.

239
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:53,630
Attack!

240
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,390
Hurry!

241
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,600
The dart is poisoned. She won't get far.

242
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,930
Everyone, split up and search!

243
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:03,560
Let's go!

244
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:31,960
Physician Xiao.

245
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,000
Physician Xiao!

246
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,030
It's Mr. Yan.

247
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,900
Physician Xiao!

248
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,310
Why is this whistle sound...

249
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:34,720
Mr. Yan!

250
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,440
Physician Xiao.

251
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,680
How did this whistle end up with you?

252
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,400
Yuan...

253
00:18:59,030 --> 00:18:59,880
You are Yuan?

254
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,880
You really are Yuan.

255
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,470
I finally found you.

256
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,170
I'm your older brother.

257
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,270
Brother?

258
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:12,950
You don't remember?

259
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,270
I understand why you don't remember me.

260
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:17,160
But look.

261
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:19,150
Look at this Golden Swallow.

262
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,910
Does it remind you of anything?

263
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,260
This is the only keepsake Mother left us.

264
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,580
Only the sound of your whistle

265
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:26,680
can awaken it.

266
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,070
No wonder.

267
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,200
All these days,

268
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:12,310
I've been dreaming of

269
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,440

That day, Old Madam Wu

entrusted the Golden Swallow to me.

302
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,300
I never expected

303
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:50,750
that the person you were looking for

304
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,970
would turn out to be my sister.

305
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:55,670
I remember when I was a child,

306
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,670
I was kidnapped by villains.

307
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:00,240
Due to the trauma

308
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,400
and the injury to the back of my head,

309
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,800
my childhood memories became very blurry.

310
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,540
Thanks to the Golden Swallow,

311
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,450
we siblings
have finally recognized each other.

312
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:11,970
I'm truly happy

313
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
that I got to see you again, Brother.

314
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:17,510
But I came to the Xiao family
at a very young age,

315
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,850
and they've always treated me
like their own daughter.

316
00:23:20,850 --> 00:23:21,850
You can be at ease.

317
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:24,680
I...

318
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:27,390
I've put you through so much.

319
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:30,360
I don't even know
how to make it up to you.

320
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:31,360
Brother,

321
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,720
I ask for nothing else;

322
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,510
I only hope you can agree to one thing
for me.

323
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,110
Of course.

324
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,040
Go ahead.

325
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,640
The Soul-Piercing Nail in your body

326
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
must be removed as soon as possible.

327
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,270
Senior.

328
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,040
All right.

329
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:00,270
Good.

330
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,750
Since you've agreed so readily, Senior,

331
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:04,480
you can't change your mind now.

332
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,610
Alright, Xueyu.

333
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,000
Take good care of Senior.

334
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,200
I'll go out for a while.

335
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,310
Wait for me to come back.

336
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:09,920
Qiushui,

337
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,970
thank you for your help.

338
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,550
[Tang Sect]

339
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,790
During the Tang Sect incident,

340
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,500
Tang Yaoshun and Old Madam Tang
were killed by Tang Song,

341
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:24,360
and Tang Fang was also controlled
by puppet needle.

342
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,880
This is weird.

343
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,200
The gate is wide open,

344
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,120
and there's not even a single guard
on duty.

345
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,680
Stop right there.

346
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,310
Take another half step forward,

347
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,970
and your guts will be torn out.

348
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:50,800
Thank you for the warning, Master.

349
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,640
The Tang Sect doesn't open its gate
to welcome guests,

350
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,200
but to face enemies.

351
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,440
So are we going in or not?

352
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,060
This isn't the only entrance.

353
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:31,960
Who are these people?

354
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,650
Why are they all locked up here?

355
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:37,040
They're living medicine vessels.

356
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,200
My blood is almost drained dry.

357
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,330
Please stop taking it.

358
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,130
Please stop.

359
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,680
Please.

360
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,760
Please stop.

361
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,240
Please.

362
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,400
Someone's finally here.

363
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:56,310
Has Mr. Tang finally remembered me?

364
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,880
I knew it.

365
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,920
I knew he would need me,
the living medicine vessel

366
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,240
he created with his own hands,
sooner or later.

367
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:03,960
Mr. Tang

368
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,680
is dead.

369
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:06,680
What?

370
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,310
How did he die?

371
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:09,920
I killed him.

372
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,310
Dead?

373
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,350
He's actually dead?

374
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,000
Becoming a living medicine vessel

375
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,800
means suffering for a lifetime.

376
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,600
I've held on until now

377
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,240
just to wait for Mr. Tang,

378
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,400
so I could kill him
with my own hands and get my revenge.

379
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,530
And now, you tell me he's already dead,

380
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,960
and that you killed him!

381
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:36,870
How could you beat me to killing him?

382
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:48,790
You old man.

383
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,240
We hadn't even touched you,
yet you went and attacked us.

384
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,440
Young man,

385
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,920
that medicinal scent on you... You must be

386
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:03,640
one of the living medicine vessels
Mr. Tang cultivated later, aren't you?

387
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,240
But you're quite fortunate.

388
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:08,310
You haven't become
a true living medicine vessel yet.

389
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,550
Since you killed him,

390
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,000
why have you come here?

391
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,680
I want Mr. Tang's
Secret Method of Meridian Restoration.

392
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,110
Once you become a living medicine vessel,

393
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:20,480
you'll be controlled by others for life.

394
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,680
Do you know that
the Secret Method of Meridian Restoration

395
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,140
requires a life for a life?

396
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,750
A life for a life?

397
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,720
Of course I know.

398
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,510
All those who treat lives as worthless

399
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,600
deserve to die!

400
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,240
Master.

401
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:36,320
I found it.

402
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,210
Let's go.

403
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,310
-Let's go find Tang Fang.
-Being neither human nor ghost

404
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,500
is the suffering of
being living medicine vessel!

405
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:51,060
It's something
you should fully experience!

406
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,810
Where is Tang Fang?

407
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,110
If you hurt me now,

408
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:29,710
she won't let you off easily.

409
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,310
Fang.

410
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,040
Tang Fang.

411
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,510
Hurry up and do it.

412
00:29:57,310 --> 00:29:58,000
He's the one

413
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,840
who killed your father.

414
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,370
What nonsense are you talking about?

415
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,780
Get the ring first!

416
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,710
Fang!

417
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,370
Brother.

418
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:41,540
Let's go.

419
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,110
Tang Fang!

420
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,170
Master and I are here to save you.

421
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:58,960
Let's go.

422
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,290
Chief, this...

423
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,200
Feel free to tell me.

424
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,270
It's only been a few days,

425
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,860
but the poison is spreading

426
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,200
much faster than I expected.

427
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:26,640
Chief,

428
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:28,460
if you want to detox,

429
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,920
as I mentioned before,

430
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,640
only the Tang Sect's...

431
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:45,640
Chief.

432
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,640
The Strengthening Pill

433
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,540
has miraculous effects
in strengthening the body.

434
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:54,750
It may help alleviate
the poison within you.

435
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,680
Herbal King is unable to
detoxify you, Chief,

436
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,310
but I am.

437
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:11,930
Herbal King.

438
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:15,240
Please go to Mr. Xiao's place

439
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,010
and check on Miss Tang.

440
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,550
Yes.

441
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,310
I'll use the Tang Sect's
living medicine vessel

442
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,640
to detoxify you, Chief.

443
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:30,350
Suifeng.

444
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,680
You just heard it too.

445
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:36,720
Herbal King gave me a Strengthening Pill.

446
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,270
Now that you've joined the Power Gang,

447
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,880
you're granted a new life.

448
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,270
From now on,

449
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,640
you don't have to be trapped
in these old grudges anymore.

450
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,500
What you did for me before, Chief,

451
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:51,510
I will never forget.

452
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,920
Don't overthink it.

453
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,280
You may go now.

454
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,030
Mr. Xiao,

455
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,500
the puppet needle in Miss Tang's body

456
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,890
has penetrated into her bone marrow.

457
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:17,750
If...

458
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:18,920
If what?

459
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:21,070
Please speak frankly, Senior.

460
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:22,720
If there's any carelessness,

461
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,590
the puppet needle
will lash back at its remover.

462
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,270
Mr. Xiao,

463
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,680
perhaps we should wait a bit longer.

464
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,140
Senior,

465
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,720
this is a matter of life and death.

466
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,240
Since it has penetrated into
her bone marrow,

467
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:35,680
we cannot wait any longer.

468
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,200
I beg you to tell me
how to save her, Senior.

469
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:39,920
Mr. Xiao,

470
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,010
when removing the needles,

471
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,070
you must protect yourself

472
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,070
to prevent the puppet needle
from entering your meridians.

473
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:49,680
Be extremely careful of the backlash.

474
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:50,870
Otherwise...

475
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,600

00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:02,550

00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:34,000
You just care about her.

553
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,180
I really didn't expect

554
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,880
that you actually went to the Power Gang

555
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,810
and brought Herbal King here for me

556
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,860
to remove the Soul-Piercing Nail

557
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:47,960
from my body.

558
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:50,680
But the Soul-Piercing Nail

559
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,770
had affected me deeply.

560
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,460
I fear I may never recover.

561
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:58,280
Don't tell Yuan about this for now.

562
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,720
Let me ask you.

563
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,920
What is the purpose of living?

564
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,300
To savor life while alive,

565
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,880
to die without regrets,

566
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,450
and to do what righteousness demands.

567
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,560
Then this life has not been in vain!

568
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,660
This life has not been in vain!

569
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:32,290
Make sure you get all the herbs

570
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:34,510
listed on this prescription for me.

571
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:35,710
No mistakes allowed.

572
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,880
Why do you need these herbs, Master?

573
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,890
Just do as you're told.

574
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:45,360
Don't ask about anything else.

575
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,880
I shouldn't have asked.

576
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:50,360
-It's just I want to help...
-Are you doubting me?

577
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,810
I wouldn't dare.

578
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,410
Whatever your decision is,

579
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,440
I'll help you accomplish it.

580
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:00,910
I only wish to stay by your side, Master,

581
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,710
until my last breath.

582
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:08,770
Be careful.

583
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,200
Let no outsider learn of it.

584
00:40:12,150 --> 00:40:12,760
Okay.

585
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:17,000
I'll gather all the herbs for you
right away, Master.

586
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,630
Buns! Buns!

587
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,110
Come get your buns!

588
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,320
Freshly steamed buns!

589
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,150
Buns! Buns!

590
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,320
Come buy some buns!

591
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,250
Careful, it's hot.

592
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:39,160
Deliver this medicine back to Master.

593
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,280
Use the back door.

594
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,270
Yes.

595
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,680
Boss, I'll leave the money here.

596
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,230
Red Phoenix, why would you have time
to visit a pharmacy?

597
00:40:58,230 --> 00:40:59,030
Of course

598
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,320
I'm here to buy medicine.

599
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,710
Is there a problem?

600
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,150
The medicine you came specially to buy

601
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:05,550
must be quite important.

602
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,070
I'm curious to see it.

603
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,670
Master caught a slight cold today,

604
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,370
so I came specifically
to get some medicine for him.

605
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:16,370
If you don't believe me, Blade King,

606
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,860
feel free to check.

607
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:21,850
Liu Suifeng had you come all the way
just to collect these herbs?

608
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,320
Whatever concerns Master,

609
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,590
I handle personally.

610
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,280
It's none of your business.

611
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,740
Our sect is in turmoil now.

612
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,320
Who knows who the next traitor will be?

613
00:41:31,510 --> 00:41:32,440
I certainly hope

614
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:34,270
this blade I made for Liu Suifeng

615
00:41:34,510 --> 00:41:35,970
will never need to be used.

616
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,030
If it were,

617
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:39,810
it would break Chief's heart.

618
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,690
Rest assured, Blade King.

619
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,320
This precious blade you forged

620
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:46,450
will never be needed in this lifetime.

621
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,320
Sorry that your trouble
has been for nothing.

622
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,320
He's the most cunning and calculating one
in our sect.

623
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,370
How can you guarantee his loyalty?

624
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:58,840
I don't have to think about that.

625
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,240
I only seek to follow him.

626
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,750
If he's disloyal,

627
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,110
then use that blade in your hand

628
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,320
to kill me first.

629
00:42:05,510 --> 00:42:07,280
Defending such a cold-faced demon

630
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,510
like this,

631
00:42:09,070 --> 00:42:10,400
it's truly surprising.

632
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,000
That's because none of you
understand Master.

633
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,530
He only appears heartless,

634
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,460
but the deep affection
he has for those he values

635
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:23,960
is beyond anything you could imagine.

636
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,390
Since you're willing to
speak so highly of him,

637
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,250
you must be someone he values too.

638
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,450
Those Master truly values

639
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:37,250
are very few indeed.
