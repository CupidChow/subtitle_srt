1
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,560
If you don't believe me, Yiren,

2
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,480
just kill me with your sword.

3
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,710
Yiren, I only ask

4
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,440
that after I die,

5
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,370
don't trust Xiao Qiushui so readily.

6
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,760
He's already lost the fighting spirit
of our Xiao family.

7
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,920
My final request, Yiren,

8
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,960
is for you to destroy the Power Gang

9
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,280
and kill Li Chenzhou

10
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:26,940
and Liu Suifeng

11
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,780
to avenge our parents.

12
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,800
Why?

13
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,750
I don't even know who to trust anymore.

14
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,310
You've both changed completely.

15
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,430
I'm the only one kept in the dark.

16
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,480
I worked in the shadows,

17
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,060
while you were in plain sight, Yiren.

18
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,150
You endured all those humiliations

19
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,870
for my sake.

20
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:14,870
Yiren,

21
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,250
if you truly don't know who to believe,

22
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:22,040
go back to our villa in Jindu
and see for yourself.

23
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,560
You accomplished something significant
for His Majesty, Yiren,

24
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,290
and our Xiao family has received
imperial favor.

25
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,280
It'll be clear to you right away

26
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,310
who's truly working for

27
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,460
our Xiao family's interests, Yiren.

28
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:56,870
Father,

29
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,590
Mother.

30
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,640
Your unfilial son, Xiao Yiren,

31
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:03,960
has come to see you.

32
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,720
Father,

33
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,310
Mother.

34
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,600
I'm unfilial,

35
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,200
but I can only try to restore
the Xiao family

36
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:55,510
in my own way.

37
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,120
I hope, in the realm beyond,

38
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,470
you'll not hold my weakness against me.

39
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,360
Qiushui!

40
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,010
Come on, check this out!

41
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,720
Look!

42
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
The Shaolin, Wudang, and Emei sects

43
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,270
have jointly announced
a Heroes' Gathering

44
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:36,600
to select a Martial Arts Alliance Leader
at Changban Slope.

45
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,159
The position of the Alliance Leader

46
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:43,090
hasn't been filled for many years.

47
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,210
It seems these martial artists

48
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,130
have learned about the imperial decree,

49
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:50,270
and they want to select an alliance leader

50
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,870
to lead the entire martial world
in protecting General Wu.

51
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,930
The purpose of this

52
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:57,040
is to jointly resist
the Northern Wasteland.

53
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,870
The Power Gang
and the Long River waterways

54
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:01,200
will certainly attend.

55
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,920
I think this time...

56
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
If Xiao Kaiyan claims
the title of alliance leader

57
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,420
under the guise of Zhu the Great King,

58
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:09,720
General Wu

59
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:12,830
may well be in danger.

60
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:14,630
Qiushui,

61
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:18,720
are you going to attend
the Martial Arts Tournament?

62
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,750
I must go.

63
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,560
I'll expose Xiao Kaiyan's true face
in front of everyone.

64
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,070
But the internal energies

65
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:31,920
of the Eight Masters inside your body

66
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,380
haven't fully merged yet.

67
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,720
Forcing it down now

68
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,530
will surely damage your body.

69
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,510
Besides, Kaiyan

70
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,110
has used the Voidheart Codex

71
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,100
to steal martial skills
from many martial masters.

72
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,390
Are you really confident?

73
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,850
Don't worry.

74
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,290
No matter what,

75
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,000
even if I die,

76
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,530
I won't let him have his way.

77
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:55,270
Qiushui,

78
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,850
I believe in you.

79
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,530
This Martial Arts Tournament—

80
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,490
who else but you could lead it?

81
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,510
Well said!

82
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,840
Well said!

83
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,040
-Fifth Thug!
-Big Brother!

84
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,070
Fifth Thug, we're here!

85
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,270
-Fifth Thug!
-Fifth Thug!

86
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,000
Big Brother!

87
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,380
We're here!

88
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:11,600
You guys!

89
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,270
-Qiushui.
-Big Brother.

90
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,470
We believe in you too.

91
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,000
Yuhan.

92
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,010
Your family affairs...

93
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,100
Everything's been taken care of.

94
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,890
Big Brother.

95
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,870
At such an important moment
when you're running for

96
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,720
the Martial Arts Alliance Leader,
how could I possibly be absent?

97
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,520
That's right.

98
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,070
I've already sent word home,

99
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,000
telling them to wait patiently

100
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,730
for our Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood's
good news.

101
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,720
We Four Thugs
can't miss out on something like this!

102
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,270
That's right,
can't do without the Four Thugs!

103
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,720
Can't do without us!

104
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,830
Fifth Thug! We're essential!

105
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,810
Absolutely essential!

106
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,040
In my life,

107
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,870
I hold the greatest respect for

108
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,400
those who are benevolent, righteous,
loyal, and trustworthy.

109
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,600
With your support,

110
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,560
I, Xiao Qiushui,

111
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,160
thank you all.

112
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,720
It should be us thanking you.

113
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,070
If you hadn't let us join
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood,

114
00:08:06,070 --> 00:08:06,800
we'd still be

115
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,800
wandering aimlessly somewhere.

116
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,510
Yes, exactly!

117
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,040
I wouldn't know where I'd be now.

118
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,920
-Well said!
-That's right!

119
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,560
Qiushui,

120
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,160
we're all like sworn brothers,

121
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,360
so there's no need for formalities.

122
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,270
Right, no formalities!

123
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,720
No need for formalities.

124
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,870
That's right.

125
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,600
Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood!

126
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,120
United by righteousness!

127
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,330
United by righteousness!

128
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,000
Today's Martial Arts Tournament

129
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,530
brings together heroes
from all over the land

130
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:38,909
is to determine the greatest
martial artist of the Central Plains.

131
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,030
The winner will be granted
the Alliance Leader's token

132
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,559
and lead the martial heroes

133
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,750
in rescuing General Wu.

134
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,910
Anyone who is not guilty of
unforgivable crimes, debauchery,

135
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,200
or betrayal of Daxi

136
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,720
may participate in the competition.

137
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,240
The competition will be a tournament,

138
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,570
with one-on-one duels.

139
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,440
The final winner
will proceed to Canghai Pavilion,

140
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,840
where, under the witness of
the Shaolin, Wudang, and Emei sects,

141
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,640
they'll be bestowed
the Alliance Leader's title.

142
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,330
As expected,

143
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,720
the Alliance Leader will be decided
between you and me.

144
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,920
Aren't the Long River waterways
enough for you to manage?

145
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,720
Coming to snatch
the position of Alliance Leader,

146
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,650
surely you have ulterior motives.

147
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,150
To be able to compete with you

148
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,600
in front of the heroes
from across the land

149
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,270
is worth it.

150
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,840
You are truly hypocritical.

151
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,320
Since we can't see eye to eye,

152
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,720
let's just start fighting.

153
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:55,240
Wait!

154
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,080
Xiao Yiren?

155
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,030
Why is Qiushui's eldest brother here?

156
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,830
Why is he here?

157
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,200
Yiren.

158
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,900
Don't call me that.

159
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,780
You're not yet qualified to fight me.

160
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,960
Defeat your elder brother first,
and then we'll see.

161
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:25,750
Yiren.

162
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,080
You really choose to trust him?

163
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,720
Enough talk.

164
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,220
Make your move!

165
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:07,270
This...

166
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,860
No matter where we are,

167
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:23,690
you're always such a handful.

168
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:25,370
Are you done with your act?

169
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,040
Don't forget who you really are.

170
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,630
-Second Young Master Xiao?
-Xiao Kaiyan?

171
00:14:55,630 --> 00:14:56,720
It's actually Xiao Kaiyan.

172
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,120
This is the second son
of the Xiao family, right?

173
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,000
Xiao Kaiyan?

174
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,180
Why is he here? How could it be him?

175
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:10,240
Yiren?

176
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:14,690
You want to kill me?

177
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,750
By killing you,

178
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,630
I can avenge our parents.

179
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Xiao Yiren!

180
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,850
For Qiushui's sake,

181
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,100
you're actually going to kill me?

182
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:38,360
Why do you always take his side?

183
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,240
Our parents did,

184
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,120
and now you do too.

185
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,910
Just die!

186
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,920
Young Master!

187
00:16:11,910 --> 00:16:12,960
Yiren!

188
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:34,320
Yiren.

189
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:35,750
Young Master!

190
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,510
-Yiren!
-Young Master!

191
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:36,910
Young Master!

192
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:39,310
Zhu the Great King is actually
Xiao Kaiyan?

193
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,050
Xiao Kaiyan!

194
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:41,360
Yes, indeed.

195
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,100
What's this all about?

196
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,550
I'm Zhu the Great King.

197
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,440
I'm also Xiao Kaiyan.

198
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,360
Xiao Kaiyan!

199
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,630
So where is Zhu the Great King?

200
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:01,160
Where is Zhu the Great King?

201
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,730
Are you trying to betray me?

202
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,640
Xiao Qiushui.

203
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,589
At this point,

204
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,060
what can you possibly do to me?

205
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:21,880
Your heart

206
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,680
is truly merciless.

207
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:45,510
Qiushui.

208
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:49,200
Yiren!

209
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,810
-This...
-This...

210
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,480
Let's go.

211
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,550
We should go.

212
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,240
Yiren.

213
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:14,110
Yiren.

214
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,720
Qiushui.

215
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,110
It's alright.

216
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,320
That palm strike just now

217
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:27,680
was owed to you.

218
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,530
I don't deserve to be your elder brother.

219
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,380
I was deceived by too many lies

220
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,830
and brought shame

221
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,610
to the Xiao family.

222
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,110
Yiren.

223
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,060
What nonsense are you talking about?

224
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,510
Don't talk anymore.

225
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:54,070
I need you to live.

226
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,350
Qiushui.

227
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,350
It's my fault,

228
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,720
entirely my fault.

229
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:07,440
There were signs all along,

230
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,310
yet I never noticed.

231
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:15,070
I've failed

232
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,240
our parents.

233
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:23,680
Yiren.

234
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,640
I'll channel my energy to heal you
right now.

235
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,840
Please stop talking.

236
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,240
No.

237
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,770
That strike just now

238
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:38,840
has severed my heart meridian.

239
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,680
This is for the best.

240
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,070
I'll no longer

241
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,400
have to live in shame anymore.

242
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,920
Q-Qiushui.

243
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,320
From now on, the Huanhua Sect

244
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,160
depends on you.

245
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,590
Qiushui.

246
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,200
Bury me beside Huanhua Stream,

247
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:22,790
on a hill where I can see the Sword Manor.

248
00:20:23,310 --> 00:20:25,310
I don't deserve to be buried inside.

249
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,750
Just bury me outside,

250
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,370
watching over the Xiao Residence.

251
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,310
Yiren...

252
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:03,960
Yiren.

253
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,240
Yiren.

254
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,110
Yiren!

255
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,320
I'll remember your words

256
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,010
and complete your mission.

257
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,920
Rest in peace, Yiren.

258
00:21:47,270 --> 00:21:49,270
Help me take care of Yiren's burial.

259
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,270
We have no interest in
the Xiao family's affairs.

260
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:50,680
As for the position of
the Martial Arts Alliance Leader,

261
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,550
I'll take it.

262
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:55,310
You think the martial world
really has no heroes left?

263
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:01,550
Here, aside from Elder Qiu, is there
anyone else worth mentioning?

264
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,310
This monk and Taoist barely count as half.

265
00:23:04,790 --> 00:23:06,120
Who else is even notable

266
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,240
from the so-called righteous sect?

267
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:10,200
Ji Wupeng!

268
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:38,250
So, do I count as part of
the righteous sect

269
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,790
or the underworld?

270
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,750
How would I know what you are?

271
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,240
State your name!

272
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,040
Big Brother!

273
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:15,270
Ji Wupeng!

274
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,240
No one has called me by the name

275
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,000
"Ji Wupeng of the Nine Yang Shadow Hand"
for 30 years.

276
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,240
Who exactly are you?

277
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,940
How do you know my name?

278
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:47,750
Ji Wupeng!

279
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,640
Such powerful internal energy.

280
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,640
Who is he?

281
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,110
I can't believe someone like this
exists in the world.

282
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,350
Those skills... He's definitely not here
with good intentions.

283
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,480
This person feels somewhat familiar.

284
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,240
You...

285
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:22,160
You're Crazy Yan?

286
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,400
He's still alive?

287
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,880
Crazy Yan isn't dead?

288
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,110
It really is Crazy Yan,

289
00:25:33,110 --> 00:25:34,440
and he's still so young.

290
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,480
Exactly!

291
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,720
This can't be right.

292
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:37,680
After all these years,

293
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:38,680
he hasn't aged at all.

294
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,030
He's become even younger
and more formidable.

295
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,430
This doesn't make sense.

296
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:42,310
I knew it.

297
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:44,830
With skills like that,
he's definitely no ordinary person.

298
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:47,830
Back then, I didn't take part in
the ambush against you

299
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:50,830
because I felt that
you roamed the martial world with pride,

300
00:25:50,830 --> 00:25:52,490
disregarding everyone else,

301
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:56,110
a spirit somewhat akin to my own.

302
00:25:56,590 --> 00:25:57,920
But now that you've come,

303
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,250
what is it that you seek?

304
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:05,940
Since you know who I am,

305
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,440
who else but me deserves

306
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,920
the Hero Command Token?

307
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,360
You don't deserve it.

308
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,970
It's been many years
without any news of him.

309
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:50,760
Big Brother!

310
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,030
Stay back!

311
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,680
For decades,

312
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,440
no one has dared to speak to me like that.

313
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:00,960
Kid,

314
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,880
what's your name?

315
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,790
Xiao Qiushui.

316
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,790
Do you know who I, Crazy Yan, am?

317
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,750
The top fighter in the martial world.

318
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,880
So as the top fighter
in the martial world,

319
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,140
am I not worthy of the Hero Command Token?

320
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,160
You're not.

321
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,400
I'm not?

322
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,960
If I'm not, then who is?

323
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,360
Only the top fighter
in the entire world is.

324
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,310
Then who deserves to be the top fighter
in the entire world?

325
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:32,430
General Wu Jie.

326
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,070
Fair enough.

327
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,260
But when it comes to martial arts,

328
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,440
I'm invincible in the entire world.

329
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,890
The truly invincible never kill.

330
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,480
The benevolent are invincible.

331
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,830
The lifeblood of the martial world

332
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:56,640
can only be sustained
through righteousness,

333
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,500
and only then can it be preserved.

334
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,170
Just with your empty words?

335
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:02,520
You're wrong.

336
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,100
It's based on the four words,
"Heroes of the World."

337
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,480
Very well.

338
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,570
At least I've learned something new.

339
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,400
After all these decades,

340
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:17,160
the martial world has finally seen
someone remarkable.

341
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:18,830
However,

342
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,710
to conquer the world,

343
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,360
you need real skills.

344
00:28:22,830 --> 00:28:24,200
If I wanted to kill you today,

345
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,530
it would be effortless.

346
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,440
But you have potential.

347
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:31,880
I might as well take you as my disciple
and teach you martial skills.

348
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,790
So why don't you kneel and kowtow to me

349
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,350
while I'm in a good mood?

350
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,070
I won't.

351
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,300
Do you know how many martial artists
in the world

352
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,350
would do anything just to have me

353
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,480
teach them a single move or technique?

354
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,920
Yet you dare decline my offer?

355
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,400
Crazy Yan is arrogant

356
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,640
and extreme in his actions.

357
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:05,310
If he sets his sights on Big Brother,

358
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,830
I'm afraid he won't stop
until he gets what he wants.

359
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:08,830
What should we do?

360
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,790
Are my martial skills not good enough?

361
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,160
No.

362
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,030
Then why is it?

363
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:34,520
I kneel only to Heaven and Earth,
to my ruler, my parents, and my master,

364
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,160
and to sages and heroes.

365
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,070
But you're nothing but a madman.

366
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:42,840
Well said.

367
00:29:44,030 --> 00:29:45,310
A madman, huh?

368
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,720
I'd like to see

369
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,960
whether you'll kneel or not.

370
00:29:59,110 --> 00:30:00,770
The Ananda Finger Technique?

371
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,070
Shaolin's Hundred-Precept Misstep!

372
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:11,510
Even someone who devotes their entire life
to Buddhism can hardly grasp

373
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:14,030
the profound mystery
of this finger technique,

374
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:16,830
yet Crazy Yan wields it
with such ease and mastery.

375
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:25,150
The Jade Vessel Water-Pouring Technique.

376
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,250
What a pathetic imitation.

377
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:21,030
Kid,

378
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:24,140
where did you steal
so many techniques from?

379
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,380
I'd rather die than kneel!

380
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,920
With your injuries,

381
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,110
stop trying to be a hero.

382
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,750
Kneel!

383
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,450
Big Brother!

384
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:05,050
Even if you don't want to kneel, you will.

385
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:08,830
I said I won't kneel, and I won't!

386
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,380
Refusing the easy way
and choosing the hard way?

387
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,320
It's the Xuantian Blacksteel Palm!

388
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:46,320
Hah, you really are a born tough one.

389
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,250
Fine then, you don't have to kneel.

390
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:50,670
Even if you kneel,

391
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:52,270
I wouldn't be able to take it.

392
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,110
The Xuantian Blacksteel Palm

393
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,150
can kill!

394
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,190
-Big Brother!
-Fifth Thug!

395
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:07,590
-Mr. Xiao!
-Mr. Xiao!

396
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,920
You're quite popular, kid.

397
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,320
They're all willing to come help you.

398
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,320
Fine then!

399
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,080
I won't waste time on these dull vermin.

400
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,100
I'll come back for you.

401
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:39,040
Don't chase him!

402
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,450
-Big Brother!
-Fifth Thug!

403
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:49,510
-Mr. Xiao!
-Mr. Xiao!

404
00:36:49,510 --> 00:36:50,910
-Big Brother!
-Mr. Xiao!

405
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:51,760
Mr. Xiao!

406
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,880
Amitabha.

407
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:57,510
Mr. Xiao, how are your injuries?

408
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,480
I'm okay.

409
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:03,400
Why did you stop us
from chasing Crazy Yan?

410
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,510
Just now, Crazy Yan

411
00:37:07,710 --> 00:37:09,590
deliberately took a strike from me.

412
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,760
Otherwise,

413
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:13,070
I would have surely died.

414
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,580
If he had wanted to kill us all,

415
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:18,110
none of us here

416
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:21,280
would have been a match for him.

417
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,360
The winner of

418
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,110
today's Martial Arts Alliance Leader
competition is:

419
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:32,840
Xiao Qiushui
of the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

420
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,190
Congratulations, Mr. Xiao.

421
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,280
Congratulations, Mr. Xiao!

422
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,880
Congratulations, Mr. Xiao.

423
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:39,110
That's wonderful! Congratulations!

424
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:41,920
Fifth Thug! Fifth Thug!

425
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,800
Mr. Xiao.

426
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,160
The martial world is in turmoil,

427
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,280
and our state is on the edge of peril.

428
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,700
From this day forward,

429
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,710
you must bear this great responsibility,

430
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:52,370
leading the martial alliance

431
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,510
to fight together against our foes.

432
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,710
-Big Brother.
-Fifth Thug.

433
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,370
Fifth Thug!

434
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,030
Take it, Fifth Thug.

435
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:05,670
Take it.

436
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,590
Take it.

437
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,400
Crazy Yan, you cheated!

438
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,890
Little rascal.

439
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,840
The position of Alliance Leader is yours,

440
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,700
but I have to take
the Hero Command Token for a while.

441
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,440
-Big Brother!
-Mr. Xiao!

442
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:10,320
Yiren.

443
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,080
I still have so many things to say to you,

444
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:18,790
but you can no longer hear me.

445
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:24,640
In the past,
you were always burdened by fame.

446
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:29,040
From now on,
the troubles of the martial world

447
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,320
will no longer concern either of us.

448
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:39,510
I'll take your sword
to travel across the land

449
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,070
and seek a place of peace for the heart.

450
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:55,420
How dare you impersonate
Zhu the Great King!

451
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:58,150
The Heavenly King
must have been killed by him!

452
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,580
Why are you all silent?

453
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:03,840
This...

454
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,680
Don't you want to kill me?

455
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:10,050
Come on then.

456
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,010
I'll fight you to the death!

457
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:30,320
Anyone else?

458
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:37,920
Then raise your heads and see clearly

459
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,030
who your Heavenly King really is.
