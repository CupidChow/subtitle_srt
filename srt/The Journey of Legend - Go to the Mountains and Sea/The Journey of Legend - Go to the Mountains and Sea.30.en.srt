[Episode 30]

3
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,600
[Power Gang]

4
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,560
Mr. Xiao.

5
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:30,710
Come.

6
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,520
Have a seat.

7
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,960
Mr. Xiao.

8
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:41,520
Were your parents' remains
safely delivered?

9
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,720
They were properly buried.

10
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,610
That's good.

11
00:02:48,430 --> 00:02:49,360
Chief Li,

12
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:52,360
why did you ask me to come here this time?

13
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,400
By the way,

14
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,400
at Nantian Abyss

15
00:02:57,829 --> 00:03:00,120
I remember Mr. Xiao once mentioned

16
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:02,000
the symbol left behind

17
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,490
by the killers
who massacred the Xiao family.

18
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,760
That's right.

19
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:09,010
I wonder

20
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,770
how this is related to the Power Gang?

21
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,829
That man is also
an enemy of the Power Gang.

22
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,800
He colluded with the Northern Wasteland

23
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
to harm Daxi.

24
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,910
As citizens of Daxi,

25
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,470
the Power Gang

26
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,710
has a duty to protect our country.

27
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,960
Chief Li, since you have
such a noble cause,

28
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,030
you should unite the martial world
against foreign enemies.

29
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,630
Why use threats

30
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:38,590
to force the community to submit?

31
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,710
This martial world
is called what it is for a reason.

32
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,400
Mr. Xiao,

33
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,920
it's not as simple as you think.

34
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:54,970
When people gather,

35
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,020
their bonds naturally fall apart.

36
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,610
If I don't use strong-arm tactics

37
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,140
to make these sects obey me,

38
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,440
I'm afraid the martial world

39
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,430
will never be united.

40
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,800
If fear makes them obey,

41
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,870
then I'll play the villain.

42
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,600
Unity shouldn't be built on fear.

43
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,529
On the contrary,

44
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:23,710
Nantian Abyss proved

45
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,410
that the martial world
values righteousness.

46
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,610
Do you think without the Power Gang

47
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:37,580
the martial world would be better?

48
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,159
No.

49
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,820
But right now, your Power Gang

50
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:47,000
is only making the martial world worse.

51
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:51,190
You want to unite the martial world,

52
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,530
but your methods are wrong.

53
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,170
You have your way of the martial world,

54
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,600
and I have mine.

55
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,050
Our ways are different,

56
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,480
but our goal is the same.

57
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,070
Chief Li,

58
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,720
why did you

59
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,790
summon me here this time?

60
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,480
To form an alliance.

61
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:30,160
The killers who massacred the Xiao family

62
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,960
and the traitors of my Power Gang

63
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:33,659
all used this item.

64
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,920
We found this
on a Northern Wastelander

65
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:38,680
who broke into Nantian Abyss.

66
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,680
It seems your eldest brother, Xiao Yiren,

67
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,310
was being used by them.

68
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,630
So that means

69
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,950
those who wiped out the Xiao family

70
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,280
and the traitors who harmed the Power Gang

71
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,280
are the same group of people.

72
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,040
Mr. Xiao.

73
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,510
Tell me—

74
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,920
who is really
pulling the strings behind all this?

75
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,620
Unfortunately, so far

76
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,780
I haven't been able to uncover

77
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:10,270
his true identity in the martial world.

78
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,540
I have a feeling

79
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,070
that his real goal

80
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,610
is more complicated than we think.

81
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,070
If that's the case,

82
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,690
we need this alliance more than ever.

83
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:35,130
Right now the only lead

84
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,530
is the Marrow-Disrupting Finger.

85
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,560
Mr. Xiao,

86
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:40,730
what do you think?

87
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,800
With the Power Gang's style,

88
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,080
how can this be called an alliance?

89
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,560
It's more like mutual exploitation.

90
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:53,750
Chief Li,

91
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:57,310
you want me
to find this person, don't you?

92
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,950
Actually, I'm leaving tomorrow

93
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,060
to confront Deng Qingfeng
of the Hailin Sect

94
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:06,720
and Fei Yuqiao
of the Fei family in person.

95
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,630
Good.

96
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,360
What do you want, Mr. Xiao?

97
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,830
Feel free to ask.

98
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,570
Coming here this time,

99
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,750
I do want

100
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,290
to ask Chief Li for a favor.

101
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,750
Go ahead.

102
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,100
The Power Gang's Herbal King

103
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,030
is skilled in a unique healing art.

104
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,390
I have a friend

105
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,980
whose father has a strange illness.

106
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,390
I need you
to send the Herbal King to treat him.

107
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,000
Sending the Herbal King
to treat someone at the Tang Sect

108
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,600
would be a bit improper.

109
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:46,310
But, Mr. Xiao,

110
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:48,950
I'll make the arrangements.

111
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,730
Thank you, Chief Li.

112
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:52,390
I'll take my leave.

113
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,830
You're still awake this late?

114
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,520
The insects are so loud
that I can't sleep.

115
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,230
Are you thinking about your father?

116
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,190
Father has been ill for years,

117
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:49,830
and it's been six months
since I left the Tang Sect.

118
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:51,630
I thought I would find news

119
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,530
of Crazy Yan at Nantian Abyss,

120
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,370
but it was all for nothing.

121

Tang Fang.

122
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,040
I believe there's more than

123
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,150
just the Voidheart Codex

124
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,490
that can save your father.

125
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,800
Others are searching for a cure too.

126
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,790
I believe

127
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,600
we'll find a way.

128
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:30,890
I hope so.

to accompany you back to the Tang Sect.

Wait here for him.

136

to cure your father's illness.

once we pass through this market,

152
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,550
we'll be at your home soon, right?

153
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,000
Yes.

154
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:41,290
I remember
you haven't been home for a long time.

155
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,890
Why don't you
bring some gifts for your family?

156
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,960
You know how it is
between my father and I.

157
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:52,750
Forget it.

158
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,440
I remember

159
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,200
your family has practiced
swordsmanship for generations.

160
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,260
I don't understand

161
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:05,320
why Uncle Deng would learn
the Marrow-Disrupting Finger.

162
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,030
My father was obsessed with martial arts,

163
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,290
but unfortunately...

164
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,510
the Hailin Sect's

165
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,390
Qianxi branch has been in decline.

166
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,910
So my father
decided to learn from various styles

167
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,710
to infuse new life into our sect.

168
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:18,390
Years ago,

169
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,100
he learned techniques from other sects,

170
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,480
the Marrow-Disrupting Finger

171
00:12:25,030 --> 00:12:26,240
might be one of them.

172
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:33,870
Since I can remember,

173
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:37,000
my father has lived in seclusion
and was rarely seen.

174
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,510
Few people in our sect
ever saw him either.

175
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,000
Over these years,
as I've traveled the martial world,

176
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,030
we've grown a little distant.

177
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,890
But Big Brother,

178
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,320
I absolutely refuse to believe

179
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,910
that my father could be

180
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,310
the one who murdered
Mr. Xiao and Mrs. Xiao.

181
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,690
Still, since he's a suspect,

182
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,470
it is only right for me to face him

183
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:02,000
and get a clear answer from him.

184
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:05,510
Yuhan,

185
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,600
if we can clear up Uncle Deng's suspicion,

186
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,150

00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,480
Yulan,

189
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,160
I'm back.

190
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,560
[Hailin Sect, Eldest daughter,
Deng Yulan]

191
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,360
Yulan, long time no see.

192
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,500
Long time no see.

193
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,530
You haven't been home in ages.

194
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,840
Go see Father in the study first.

195
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,600
I'll take Qiushui to the main hall.

196
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,080
Sure.

197
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:01,880
Big Brother, I'll go ahead then.

198
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:03,930
Let's go, Qiushui.

199
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,080
Father.

200
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,360
Qiushui.

201
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,910
You must be hungry after a long journey.

202
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:22,510
Come here.

203
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,300
I've prepared a meal just for you.

204
00:14:25,790 --> 00:14:26,550
After you finish this meal,

205
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:28,080
Father will come to see you.

206
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,750
Yulan,

207
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:33,480
thank you for your hospitality.

208
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,200
Enjoy your meal.

209
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:36,670
I'll go check on Father.

210
00:14:36,670 --> 00:14:37,150
Okay.

211
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:37,720
Please.

212
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:32,760
Big Brother.

213
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,410
Tie him up first,

214
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,630
and wait for word from Zhu the Great King.

215
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:41,290
Yes, ma'am.

216
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,530
Where is he?

217
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,960
Search for him! Quickly!

218
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,560
-Understood!
-Understood.

219
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,870
Qiushui, how could you...

220
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:55,480
Yulan.

221
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,600
Sorry.

222
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,910
Tell me—

223
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,730
where is Uncle Deng?

224
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,270
Uncle Deng.

225
00:16:08,630 --> 00:16:09,690
I know you're home.

226
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,230
I don't want to fight.

227
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,300
Please show yourself.

228
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,440
How dare you!

229
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,910
Are you trying to make a move
at my Hailin Sect?

230
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:51,670
This Lion Roar skill
makes one's body go numb

231
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,980
and give them a splitting headache.

232
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,380
I didn't expect Uncle Deng's
internal energy to be so strong.

233
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,840
Xiao Qiushui.

234
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,960
I know nothing
about what happened to your family.

235
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,360
For the sake
of your friendship with my son,

236
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,400
I won't make things difficult
for you today.

237
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,550
Leave now.

238
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,619
Uncle Deng,

239
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,589
I came here to uncover

240
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,790
the true culprit who murdered my parents.

241
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,450
Please meet me face-to-face.

242
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,440
You just won't accept my kindness!

243
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,810
Don't blame me for what happens next.

244
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,970
The smell of saltpeter.

245
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,780
So he's using mechanical tricks
to control hidden weapons.

246
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:41,640
Uncle Deng,

247
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,560
your internal energy
isn't that strong at all.

248
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:48,240
You might as well show yourself now.

249
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,550
Nonsense!

250
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,380
Prepare to die!

251
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:57,240
Uncle Deng.

252
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,490
It's time for you to show up.

253
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,470
Marrow-Disrupting Finger.

254
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,850
Why does he appear
to have a weak internal energy?

255
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,320
Father!

256
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:26,880
Father!

257
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:28,670
Are you alright, Father?

258
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,960
Father!

259
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:32,840
Big Brother.

260
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,510
Why did you two fight?

261
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,350
Yuhan,

262
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,740
Uncle Deng has internal injuries.

263
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,280
Let's sit him down and talk.

264
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:43,640
Father.

265
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:48,720
Father.

266
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:53,720
Yuhan,

267
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,440
your father
has multiple damaged meridians.

268
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,100
The palm strike I just gave him

269
00:18:58,110 --> 00:18:59,920
caused his vital energy to reverse.

270
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,320
I didn't know about this.

271
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,680
Uncle Deng.

272
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,270
I apologize.

273
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:05,760
Big Brother,

274
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,720
my father's internal energy is strong.

275
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,250
How could his meridians
suddenly be injured?

276
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,400
Yuhan,

277
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:16,630
Uncle Deng may have
his unspeakable reasons.

278
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,000
This curved wall in your home...

279
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,400
It's called an echo wall.

280
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,880
If you stand close
to the corner of the wall,

281
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,280
your voice can be amplified a hundredfold.

282
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:30,000
Even someone with average internal energy,

283
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,590
once amplified a hundredfold,

284
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,310
can make enough sound
to intimidate people.

285
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,510
And these mechanisms

286
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:37,170
are used to ignite the saltpeter blasts.

287
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,550
So Uncle Deng,

288
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,010
this is how

289
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:42,960
you've preserved

290
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,150
the Deng family’s reputation
all these years.

291
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,700
Father.

292
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:49,540
What's exactly going on?

293
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:51,790
Uncle Deng.

294
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,120
I know...

295
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:56,680
I shouldn't pry into others' secrets.

296
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,600
But about the massacre
of my Xiao family...

297
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,510
there's more to this than meets the eye.

298
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
The culprit who murdered my parents

299
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,410
is skilled
in the Marrow-Disrupting Finger.

300
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,840
That's why I came here...

301
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,310
to investigate.

302
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,900
Please tell me, Uncle Deng...

303
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,460
On the day the Sword Manor was destroyed,

304
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,820
did you visit the Xiao Residence?

305
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:28,880
Father.

306
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:30,730
What Qiushui said is true.

307
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,280
Please tell us the truth,

308
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:35,110
so that Qiushui can find

309
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,640
the murderer
of Mr. Xiao and Mrs. Xiao sooner.

310
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,880
My injuries...

311
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,160
they all began

312
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:51,030
with the incident at Baicao Valley.

313
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:02,310
In Baicao Valley...

314
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,800
I was hit by a thunder-fire bomb.

315
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,480
All my meridians were severed,

316
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,280
and I lost all my martial skills.

317
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,200
Although I survived,

318
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,030
all my martial skills

319
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,720
were gone.

320
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:25,400
For the past 15 years...

321
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,880
I've secluded myself to practice,

322
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:30,350
hoping to recover my previous skills.

323
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:32,880
But so far

324
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:37,960
I've only regained about 10 percent.

325
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:40,400
Uncle Deng.

326
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:41,880
So that means

327
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,180
you've had these injuries

328
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:46,830
for 15 years?

329
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:49,350
The Marrow-Disrupting Finger

330
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,150
requires tremendous
internal energy to perform.

331
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,750
I can no longer control it.

332
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,000
All these years,

333
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,290
I've renovated the mansion many times

334
00:22:00,510 --> 00:22:02,400
just to set up some mechanisms

335
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,140
to hide the fact that I've lost my skills.

336
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,000
When I was young,

337
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,880
with my Marrow-Disrupting Finger
and the Hailin Sword Technique,

338
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,920
I gained quite a reputation

339
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,720
in the martial world.

340
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,410
Because of that

341
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,560
I also made many enemies
who wanted me dead.

342
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,920
Back then, only Mr. Xiao

343
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,980
knew I had lost all my martial skills.

344
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:25,770
I begged him to keep my secret.

345
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,320
Although in the martial world,

346
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,720
there were many rumors about me,

347
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:32,510
still,

348
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,960
they didn't know
the real reason behind it.

349
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,200
Uncle Deng joined Zhu the Great King

350
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,820
just to find a powerful backer

351
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,910
to fight against the Power Gang.

352
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:52,790
Father,

353
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,660
you joined Zhu the Great King?

354
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:57,880
I...

355
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,880
had my reasons for doing so.

356
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,590
Seeing all the allied sects

357
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,920
fall one after another,

358
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,440
even the Huanhua Sect was caught in it.

359
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,680
I knew that all of this

360
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,590
was Liu Suifeng's doing.

361
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,750
By then, I had already lost
my martial skills.

362
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,510
If I hadn't joined Zhu the Great King,

363
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,050
how could I have ensured

364
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,480
any chance of survival for our family?

365
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,920
So that's why

366
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,800
you refused to help
the Xiao family back then.

367
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,330
Regarding the Xiao family's tragedy,

368
00:23:39,830 --> 00:23:41,830
I do feel guilty about it.

369
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,830
But I have to tell you,

370
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,920
I had nothing to do with it.

371
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,200
I'm innocent.

372
00:23:58,750 --> 00:23:59,550
But today,

373
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,790
to help you find

374
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,120
the real killer who murdered your father,

375
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,590
I will no longer hide anything.

376
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,310
Forgive me.

377
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:38,400
Grand Master Dayin's
Return-to-Breath method.

378
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,030
If the meridians are only damaged

379
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,030
and not necrotic,

380
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:44,300
one can still ask Grand Master Dayin
to repair them with golden needles.

381
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,900
But if the Return-to-Breath
cannot flow through the meridians,

382
00:24:48,110 --> 00:24:49,040
then it means...

383
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,440
Senior.

384
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:52,790
Forgive me.

385
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:58,350
Father...

386
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:07,830
Father.

387
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:09,180
Father.

388
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,200
Senior.

389
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,110
I'm so sorry.

390
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,030
Your injuries are old.

391
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:21,040
Now you can only recover
10 percent of your power.

392
00:25:28,310 --> 00:25:29,000
It's fine.

393
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,590
I accepted this fact long ago.

394
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:34,790
My only hope now

395
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,970
is for my family

396
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,550
to stay safe.

397
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,840
Father.

398
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,070
Liu Suifeng.

399
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,310
Liu Suifeng,

400
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,750
I knew you would come.

401
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,010
If you're here for revenge,

402
00:26:21,310 --> 00:26:22,510
then just kill me.

403
00:26:23,510 --> 00:26:25,110
Right now, my biggest regret

404
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,750
is not killing you, the son of a traitor,

405
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,780
when I had the chance—

406
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,110
allowing you to harm
the martial world today.

407
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,830
You keep calling me a traitor.

408
00:26:37,510 --> 00:26:40,830
Today, I will make sure
you die knowing the truth.

409
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,960
This is the testimony of Yuchi Qing,
an assassin from the Northern Wasteland.

410
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:55,240
Baicao Valley has always been reclusive

411
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,960
and never dealt
with the Northern Wasteland.

412
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,290
The pills my mother made

413
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:02,960
were originally for the poor.

414
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:07,000
When the Northern Wastelanders
learned of this,

415
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,200
they wanted them as military supplies.

416
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,590
After their demands were refused,

417
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:13,240
they spread rumors
throughout the martial world

418
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,500
and ruined Baicao Valley's reputation.

419
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:18,730
Impossible.

420
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,040
Impossible.

421
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,170
There were
Northern Wastelanders in Baicao Valley!

422
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,680
Back then, we got a tip
that Baicao Valley was colluding

423
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,610
with Northern Wastelanders
to make Marching Pills.

424
00:27:30,110 --> 00:27:32,510
So, under Mr. Xiao's leadership,

425
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:36,440
we went to Baicao Valley to investigate.

426
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,960
Chief Liu,

427
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,110
I promise that once we enter the valley,

428
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,350
we won't harm anyone without cause.

429
00:27:51,790 --> 00:27:53,450
If we don't find any evidence,

430
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:56,050
I, Xiao, am willing

431
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,790
to apologize to Baicao Valley.

432
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,750
No way!

433
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,350
Baicao Valley is not a place

434
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:03,590
you can just come
and search based on false charges.

435
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:04,680
We may be weak,

436
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:06,360
but we're the most upright,

437
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,510
and we won't allow you
to trample and humiliate us.

438
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:08,920
That's right!

439
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,650
What do you think this place is?

440
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:16,830
What should we do now?

441
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,960
What does this mean?

442
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,480
Mr. Xiao.

443
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:26,270
They...

444
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,100
Should we force our way in?

445
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,200
No.

446
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:33,000
Give Chief Liu some time to consider.

447
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,350
I believe

448
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,830
she will make the right decision.

449
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,400
Back then,

450
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,720
Mr. Xiao gave your mother

451
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,000
a chance to prove her innocence.

452
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:47,240
But she was so stubborn.

453
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:52,590
If she had nothing to hide,

454
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:54,680
why would she react that way?

455
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,370
You came to Baicao Valley like bandits

456
00:28:58,470 --> 00:29:00,270
yet you expected a warm welcome?

457
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,720
Besides, you say one thing,

458
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:05,160
but in the end,
you broke into my home

459
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,470
and brutally slaughtered my people

460
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,200
without distinction.

461
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:13,350
Mother!

462
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:16,510
Mother!

463
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:18,880
Mother!

464
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,310
Mother!

465
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,000
Mother!

466
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:36,750
I watched my mother die before my eyes.

467
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,440
And my people...

468
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:42,790
all turned into cold, lifeless bodies.

469
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,130
In such a short time,

470
00:29:46,790 --> 00:29:49,750
you didn't interrogate or gather evidence,

471
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:52,630
you just started a massacre.

472
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,310
It was because Baicao Valley's people,

473
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:56,070
seeing their crimes
were about to be exposed,

474
00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:58,170
wanted to kill us to silence us.

475
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:02,740
[Shijushan Monastery]

476
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:19,150
What on earth is going on?

477
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,040
What's going on?

478
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:30,960
Hurry!

479
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:33,020
They're moving the evidence!

480
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:40,960
Marching Pills!

481
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,510
Northern Wastelanders?

482
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:51,810
Baicao Valley was really making
Marching Pills for the Northern Wasteland.

483
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:54,070
So many witnesses

484
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:55,960
saw Northern Wastelanders

485
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:58,350
moving Marching Pills in Baicao Valley.

486
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,190
How can you still deny it?

487
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,200
How do you know

488
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,350
it wasn't one of your people
who colluded with the Northern Wasteland,

489
00:31:04,350 --> 00:31:06,880
stole the
Marching Pill formula in disarray,

490
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,370
killed the witnesses,

491
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:09,970
and then buried the truth?

492
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:10,960
Nonsense!

493
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,510
Before we entered the valley,

494
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,350
we already saw

495
00:31:13,350 --> 00:31:15,070
the ledger recording
Baicao Valley's transactions

496
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:16,880
with Northern Wastelanders
for Marching Pills.

497
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,410
Every transaction
was documented in detail.

498
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:21,400
Our brothers
guarding the back of the mountain

499
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,270
caught you trying to move the evidence,

500
00:31:23,270 --> 00:31:24,310
and were brutally killed,

501
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,440
with no survivors.

502
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,210
Baicao Valley's collusion with the enemy

503
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,200
is undeniable!

504
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,680
Undeniable?

505
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,590
Who brought the ledger?

506
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,440
Who's behind this?

507
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,590
I... I...

508
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,270
I don't know.

509
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:51,350
Fine.

510
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:56,340
It seems I'll have
to make you suffer a little.

511
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,880
Now I'm even more curious

512
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:08,550
who you're protecting so much.

513
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,010
If we had known

514
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:12,590
you would become such a villain today,

515
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:17,550
Mr. Xiao should never have
saved your life back then.

516
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,810
What did you say?

517
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:28,680
Back then, Mr. Xiao
found you half-dead,

518
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,200
he kindheartedly saved your life,

519
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,840
and had someone take you to the Tang Sect.

520
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,920
That's why you're alive today.

521
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:48,880
Mother...

522
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:51,240
Go check over there.

523
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,570
There's someone alive.

524
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:54,210
Careful. Come.

525
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,380
Be careful.

526
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,480
There's someone alive here!

527
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,400
Wake up.

528
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:17,030
Tang Sect?

529
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,550
Which family are you from?

530
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:22,200
I am...

531
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,850
from the Liu family.

532
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,530
You're from the Liu family?

533
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,440
But I never expected

534
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,750
you would lead
the Power Gang to siege the Xiao family.

535
00:33:31,750 --> 00:33:32,880
Is there any justice

536
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,440
in this world?

537
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,800
Just because you spared my life,

538
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:43,160
you claim to be kind-hearted?

539
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,490
I'll ask you one last time—

540
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,550
who brought the ledger back then?

541
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:57,790
Fine.

542
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,550
Let's see what's tougher—

543
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:06,080
your stubbornness or my fists.

544
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:15,880
Say it!

545
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:20,340
Master.

546
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:21,440
Master.

547
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,280
If you don't talk,

548
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,960
I'll come back tomorrow and ask you again.

549
00:34:33,190 --> 00:34:33,710
Father.

550
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:35,550
Come in.

551
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,360
Father.

552
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,449
Yulan is resting now.

553
00:34:48,449 --> 00:34:49,110
She's fine.

554
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,030
Good.

555
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,489
How are your injuries?

556
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:55,969
I'm fine.

557
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:57,840
Alright.

558
00:34:58,510 --> 00:34:59,230
Have a seat.

559
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:00,510
Okay.

560
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:13,950
Father,

561
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:15,990
are you hiding something

562
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,770
about the Baicao Valley incident?

563
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,030
Nonsense!

564
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,100
I have nothing to hide.

565
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,530
Others may not know,

566
00:35:27,710 --> 00:35:29,030
but I know you well.

567
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,340
Every time you lie,

568
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,430
your eyes look down.

569
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,360
You...

570
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:36,980
Father...

571
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:40,070
Liu Suifeng is a ruthless man.

572
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:41,760
Once he targets us,

573
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,970
the Hailin Sect
will never have peace again.

574
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,050
This is your favorite tea.

575
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,920
What are you doing?

576
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,250
You just got home.
Where are you going now?

577
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,170
I'm going to find Qiushui.

578
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:26,030
A sect allied with Zhu the Great King

579
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:30,150
is no better than the Power Gang.

580
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,000
At dawn tomorrow,

581
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,030
I'll leave with Qiushui.

582
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:43,710
Father.

583
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,350
I hope you can come to your senses

584
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,600
and stop disappointing me.

585
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:38,670
A sect allied with Zhu the Great King

586
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,480
is no better than the Power Gang.

587
00:37:48,550 --> 00:37:49,150
Father.

588
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,400
I hope you can come to your senses

589
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,010
and stop disappointing me.

590
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,890
What's going on?

591
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,880
What on earth is going on?

592
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,510
Hurry!

593
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:08,790
They're moving the evidence.

594
00:38:54,950 --> 00:39:01,550
[Qianxi Inn]

595
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:57,030
It's this one.

596
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,560
Let's go.

597
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,230
Yuhan.

598
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,510

Uncle Deng's fatal wound

637
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,930
is the one behind his heart.

638
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:50,480
This was caused
by a hidden weapon from the Tang Sect.

639
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:52,720
Besides that,

640
00:40:54,730 --> 00:40:57,730
there are many other wounds
caused by external force.

641
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,750
I've examined these wounds.

642
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:03,570
It must be Liu Suifeng.

643
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,940
These wounds on Father's body

644
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,860
all match the shape of his fan.

645
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,840
It's my fault.

646
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,440
Father.

647
00:41:12,450 --> 00:41:13,340
I'm sorry.

648
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:16,450
I shouldn't have argued with you.

649
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,920
I shouldn't have said those things.

650
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,850
Most of all, I shouldn't have left!

651
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,670
Father.

652
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:31,000
It's all my fault.

653
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:34,060
Father.

654
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:38,630
Father.

655
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,070

656
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,510
Father.

657
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,070
Father, it's all my fault.

658
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,060
I should have stayed
and protected you, Father.

659
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,670
It's my fault.

660
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,150
I'm sorry.

661
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:01,800
Look.

662
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,670
Half of the paper was torn off.

663
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:06,710
I suspect

664
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,870
Uncle Deng was trying to
leave a message for you.
