1
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,840
It hurts so much.

2
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,360
Are you alright?

3
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,800
It really hurts.

4
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,150
You're reckless and clumsy,

5
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,560
with such poor lightness skill—

6
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,840
flying around blindly.

7
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,900
Next time, I'll...

8
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,560
Qiushui, look.

9
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,400
I found this falconry whistle

10
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,330
in a secret compartment in the Sword King's bedroom.

11
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,590
The Sword King had a falconry whistle too.

12
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,250
He didn't get along with Liu Suifeng.

13
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:27,840
Apart from the power struggle within their gang,

14
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,150
it's probably related to the Northern Wasteland too.

15
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,230
Oh, right.

16
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:34,950
Look at these.

17
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,170
These secret letters.

18
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,579
"Proceed, but avoid being noticed."

19
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,520
"Follow your plan, and don't get caught."

20
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:46,329
"Good suggestion, but wait a while longer."

21
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,400
What... what does this mean?

22
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,430
This should be a foreign character.

23
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,910
I don't recall anyone in the Central Plains martial world

24
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,150
who can read foreign script.

25
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,310
Also, look at these.

26
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,900
These characters aren't written in the current style.

27
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,000
I almost missed it.

28
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,960
Ever since I'm here,

29
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,120
all the characters I've seen have been traditional.

30
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
How could

31
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,930
simplified Chinese characters appear here?

32
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,850
And this English character...

33
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,200
can't be a coincidence either.

34
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:26,910
Sancai.

35
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,710
I have a crazy idea.

36
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,020
Could there be someone here who has had the same experience as I do?

37
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,710
Maybe there's someone else who's transmigrated to this world.

38
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:41,710
Are you... asking me?

39
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,710
Qiushui,

40
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,240
how would I know?

41
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,190
I have no idea.

42
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:54,920
I'm not joking around with you.

43
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,800
Then tell me,

44
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:03,000
what would be the Sword King's ultimate fate?

45
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:05,630
And what kind of person was he in the original story?

46
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:07,000
Sword King Qu Hanshan is

47
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,910
loyal to Li Chenzhou and the Power Gang.

48
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,240
He dies for Li Chenzhou.

49
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,280
He dies for Li Chenzhou...

50
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,670
That's exactly the problem.

51
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,640
You see, in my original story setting,

52
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,680
he would have never betrayed Li Chenzhou

53
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
and would have died for Li Chenzhou.

54
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,450
This falconry whistle is really strange.

55
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,570
It wasn't in my original story or outline.

56
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,800
It must be that...

57
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,000
someone else is altering things here.

58
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,310
Who could that person be?

59
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,830
Is he a friend or an enemy?

60
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:54,390
We're out in the open while he remains hidden.

61
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:55,320
If he's a friend,

62
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,450
why not reveal himself?

63
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,480
That makes sense.

64
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:00,750
You're right.

65
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,980
Following this logic,

66
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,750
ever since I arrived here,

67
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,250
many things have deviated from the original story.

68
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,040
Perhaps those aren't plot holes as I thought,

69
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,100
but things that have been rewritten.

70
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,590
The Voidheart Codex in the Xiao family's stone coffin...

71
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,720
Qiushui,

72
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,920
the Voidheart Codex should have been engraved here.

73
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:33,780
Well... someone must have deliberately erased it.

74
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,510
If it's really as I suspect,

75
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,870
this person has learned the Voidheart Codex

76
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,480
and fears I might learn it too.

77
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,080
He is our enemy, not a friend.

78
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:48,600
Perhaps he's been targeting me from the start.

79
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:54,680
Does this jade pendant belong to you?

80
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,159
Yes.

81
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,750
I am Feng Lang, the owner of the Rain Sword.

82
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:02,120
I'm here to take

83
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,130
the Hero Command Token for the Power Gang.

84
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,920
You've always called me "Lucky Bag."

85
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,390
Are you satisfied with your luck now?

86
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,430
Liu Suifeng impersonated Feng Lang,

87
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,750
luring the Sword King into defecting to the Falconry Whistle.

88
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,600
That would indeed benefit him.

89
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,290
He's the most suspicious.

90
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,160
But apart from him,

91
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,750
I really can't think of anyone else.

92
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,420
However, there's one more person

93
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,560
you can't judge.

94
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,400
Because that person has never appeared so far.

95
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:32,630
Li Chenzhou?

96
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,400
That's right.

97
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,930
He is indeed very mysterious,

98
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,190
always controlling everything from behind the scenes.

99
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:43,070
Anyone can become his pawn.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,750
Sancai.

101
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,060
I might as well go test him.

102
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:56,630
Xiao Mingming... No,

103
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,240
I should call you Xiao Qiushui.

104
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,160
We'll meet again very soon.

105
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,870
Mr. Zhu.

106
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:28,800
Miss Mingzhu, you're here.

107
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,510
Have you gathered all the ingredients for my health and qi-regulating medicine?

108
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:32,870
I've finally gathered them all.

109
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:35,040
These medicinal ingredients are truly exceptional.

110
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,900
It took many days to prepare them.

111
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,190
I've prepared them with great care.

112
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,590
Please take a look, miss.

113
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:47,370
Thank you, Mr. Zhu.

114
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,409
Take care, miss.

115
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,450
Herbal King, that old fool.

116
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,510
How dare he threaten my master?

117
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,970
Who knows if he'd tamper with that medicine?

118
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,250
It's safer to prepare the medicine for my master myself.

119
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,390
Xiao Qiushui?

120
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,360
You people from the Power Gang

121
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,240
really excel at sneak attacks.

122
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:38,360
If I hadn't been soft-hearted and covered for you at the Biechuan Temple,

123
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,789
you wouldn't have had another chance to attack my master.

124
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,590
I really should have killed you.

125
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,440
Oh, I'm so scared.

126
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,370
If you truly want what's best for your master,

127
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,720
take these back to him.

128
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,790
How did you find out my whereabouts?

129
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,910
You think only you people

130
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,640
know how to use these underhanded methods?

131
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,720
Alright, I won't waste time talking with you anymore.

132
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:05,730
Keep them safe.

133
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:08,150
In an hour,

134
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,240
you'll be unsealed automatically.

135
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,480
Master.

136
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,790
Master, are you still going to the punishment room today?

137
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,080
The Chief didn't punish you,

138
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,410
so why punish yourself?

139
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,030
The Chief didn't punish me

140
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,270
out of leniency.

141
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,430
But that's no excuse for me to avoid the punishment I deserve.

142
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,080
Alright.

143
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:34,910
Anything else?

144
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,600
Xiao Qiushui asked me to deliver these letters to you and the Chief.

145
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,600
He said the contents concern the Hero Command Token.

146
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,790
I don't know what trick he's playing,

147
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,850
nor do I dare make decisions on my own.

148
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,480
I wasn't looking for him,

149
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,200
yet he comes to me instead?

150
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,530
Since he contacted you,

151
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,340
why didn't you tell me?

152
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,200
I was afraid he'd play more tricks.

153
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,200
You think

154
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:11,550
I'd fall into his hands again?

155
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,630
That's not what I meant at all.

156
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,750
I was concerned about your injuries...

157
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,350
Forget it.

158
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,510
Let me see what other tricks he has up his sleeve.

159
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,410
What a load of nonsense.

160
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,570
Xiao Qiushui must have lost his mind!

161
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,080
Who says only those standing in the light

162
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,200
are "circle"?

163
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,220
The chimes sound, tinkling repeatedly.

164
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,390
"Circle" bells.

165
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,550
"Circle" the house, singing your song.

166
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:02,200
Who's using "circle" to play "Breaking the East Wind"?

167
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,970
What do these circles mean?

168
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,100
He really has gone mad.

169
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:22,750
Master,

170
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:23,870
then...

171
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,030
Should we still show that letter to the Chief?

172
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,910
The weather is dry; beware of fire!

173
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:47,320
The weather is dry; beware of fire!

174
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,440
Sir, you've been sitting here all day.

175
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,640
We're about to close.

176
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:55,120
Alright, I got it.

177
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,320
Okay.

178
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:04,080
The weather is dry; beware of fire!

179
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,240
If Liu Suifeng or Li Chenzhou is really "R,"

180
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,000
such a simple word game—

181
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:15,630
"the Hero Command Token is in Pipa Pavilion"—

182
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:17,560
and they still can't figure it out?

183
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,940
Have you heard?

184
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,320
All martial arts sects have received invitations

185
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,670
to go to the Emei Sect to fight against the Power Gang.

186
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,730
If that's the case,

187
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,270
it's a blessing

188
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,470
for us common people.

189
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,630
I've heard

190
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,440
that this invitation was issued by Abbess Zhichen,

191
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,770
leader of the Emei Sect.

192
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,170
If you ask me,

193
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,120
it's the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood who did great deeds.

194
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,550
They've raided Power Gang bases one after another recently,

195
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:38,120
severely wounded Liu Suifeng,

196
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,380
killed the Sword King,

197
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,210
and destroyed the Misery Pill.

198
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,720
Isn't this

199
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,870
the perfect chance to wipe out the Power Gang once and for all?

200
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,440
Indeed.

201
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,690
Mount Emei's Golden Summit...

202
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,550
Xiao Qiushui is quite cunning and eccentric.

203
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,960
If I had known

204
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,840
that the letter he sent you was the same as mine, Chief,

205
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,700
I wouldn't have brought it to you.

206
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,390
Playing mysterious games.

207
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,920
I really fell for his trick.

208
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,820
You don't need to go to the punishment room anymore.

209
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,010
It was my incompetence

210
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:32,110
that failed to notice the Sword King's collusion with the Falconry Whistle

211
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,790
and his connection with Xiao Qiushui,

212
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,790
plotting for the Death Beetle King,

213
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,240
that led to the incident.

214
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,480
The matter with the Sword King

215
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,120
was indeed unexpected.

216
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:45,750
We intercepted the Sword King's secret message to the Falconry Whistle.

217
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,550
The Falconry Whistle used the frequent internal conflicts within our gang as an excuse

218
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,010
to persuade him to defect.

219
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:53,910
Whoever tries to interfere with your plans,

220
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,960
whether it's the Falconry Whistle

221
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,030
or Xiao Qiushui,

222
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,160
I won't let them get away with it.

223
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:03,840
Xiao Qiushui is indeed troublesome.

224
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,280
His Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood

225
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,480
has destroyed many of our bases,

226
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,510
and even you were toyed with by him.

227
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,600
Someone like Xiao Qiushui

228
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:17,450
should be killed as soon as possible.

229
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,360
Every day he lives is trouble for us.

230
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,360
Suifeng.

231
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:29,620
You've been sparring with him for quite a while,

232
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,330
but you never realized.

233
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,440
Xiao Qiushui must have other means.

234
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,670
He's not part of our game either.

235
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,970
A person like him...

236
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
I've never encountered one before.

237
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,200
Keep him alive.

238
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,320
He might be useful.

239
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,600
Chief, you haven't even met him yet,

240
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,330
yet you speak so highly of him.

241
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:00,880
Mount Emei's Golden Summit...

242
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:03,230
He will definitely go there.

243
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,550
I was just worrying about

244
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:15,030
how to gather all those martial artists together.

245
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:16,960
Now, it seems

246
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,670
this works perfectly in our favor.

247
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,270
But many sects have received secret messages

248
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,000
claiming that the Hero Command Token

249
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,330
and the Voidheart Codex

250
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,630
are both in your possession, Chief.

251
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,290
Now that we've lost the Death Beetle King,

252
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,550
if all the major martial arts sects join forces...

253
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,320
You may go.

254
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,090
I have my own plans.

255
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:44,260
Yes, Chief.

256
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:59,790
You look all serious and lost in thought.

257
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,030
Qiushui,

258
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,370
are you not confident about the battle

259
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:05,119
at Mount Emei's Golden Summit?

260
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:06,869
I don't know which direction

261
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,069
things will take at Mount Emei's Golden Summit.

262
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:12,030
Then what do you plan to do?

263
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,720
I remember in the original story,

264
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,720
the Eight Masters would pass their internal energy to me there.

265
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:19,109
I don't know if that plot has been changed.

266
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,280
If things develop that way,

267
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,550
we'll have some chance of victory.

268
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,349
We must fight.

269
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,069
We have to give it a try, no matter what!

270
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:28,920
If things go according to your outline,

271
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,310
you'll capture Li Chenzhou alive,

272
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,960
win his loyalty,

273
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,040
take over the entire Power Gang,

274
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:36,640
and become the Martial Arts Alliance Leader!

275
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,460
Just thinking about it makes me so happy!

276
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,610
But if that happens,

277
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,390
wouldn't that be the grand finale of the story?

278
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,350
Does that mean you'll go back?

279
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,880
Go back?

280
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,260
But my tasks aren't finished yet.

281
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,280
I haven't uncovered who I suspect.

282
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,340
Right now, they are all...

283
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:15,640
still in danger.

284
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,500
I've made promises to my brothers...

285
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,960
and my friends.

286
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,820
And I haven't fulfilled them yet.

287
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,720
So I can't go back.

288
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,400
Then... then what are you going to do

289
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
with Li Chenzhou?

290
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,270
Li Chenzhou...

291
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,620
He is the one who destroyed our Huanhua Sect.

292
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,040
He's also an enemy of the righteous martial world.

293
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,110
Therefore...

294
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,480
I'm going to kill him.

295
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,880
Kill him, kill him! He deserves to die!

296
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,600
But I can't predict how the future story

297
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,000
will develop.

298
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,590
Even though I can't predict or guess,

299
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:15,250
I've still got you, haven't I?

300
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,480
I'll help you, of course I'll help you.

301
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:31,410
Then we'll face whatever comes...

302
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,570
and deal with each challenge as it arises.

303
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:38,350
Qiushui,

304
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,590
shouldn't we prepare to go to Mount Emei's Golden Summit

305
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,920
to discuss fighting against the Power Gang with others?

306
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,720
Yes, Qiushui,

307
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,750
let's set out together

308
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,480
and go to Mount Emei's Golden Summit.

309
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,200
We've finally waited for this day.

310
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,110
Take us with you too.

311
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:49,570
We must avenge our father.

312
00:19:50,270 --> 00:19:52,920
This gathering at Mount Emei's Golden Summit is a grand affair,

313
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:55,980
so the Power Gang will surely mobilize all their forces

314
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,240
to counter the attack from the entire martial world.

315
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,550
So what does that mean?

316
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:03,720
It means all the Power Gang's bases across the martial world

317
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,180
will be left undermanned.

318
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:09,000
This is the perfect time for us to press our advantage

319
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,310
and continue to crush the Power Gang's

320
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,160
bases planted throughout the martial world

321
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,960
and wipe them out completely!

322
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,100
Therefore,

323
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,490
we'll split into two teams.

324
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,010
Tie Xingyue, Qiu Nangu,

325
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,200
you two will handle the Power Gang's bases.

326
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,400
-Yes, Qiushui.
-Yes, Qiushui.

327
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,790
Minmiao, Mushuang,

328
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,960
you two stay here to help them too.

329
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:28,240
Understood.

330
00:20:28,590 --> 00:20:31,440
If we can catch the Power Gang off guard

331
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,400
and cut off their resources,

332
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,800
that's also a way to defeat these villains.

333
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,160
By the way, Xueyu,

334
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,240
they've already set off.

335
00:20:46,590 --> 00:20:48,270
I need to catch up with them immediately.

336
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:49,510
My journey to Emei Sect

337
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,240
will take at least 10 to 15 days.

338
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:54,310
If you encounter any trouble, go find Mr. Liang.

339
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:56,470
Don't worry about me.

340
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,030
Qiushui,

341
00:20:58,640 --> 00:20:59,700
you must promise me

342
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,800
that you'll put your own safety first at all times.

343
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,240
Don't always think about revenge

344
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,770
and put yourself in danger.

345
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,880
Don't worry, Xueyu.

346
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,310
I know what I'm doing.

347
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:12,750
Qiushui,

348
00:21:13,550 --> 00:21:14,610
you've grown up now

349
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:16,590
and found your own path.

350
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,800
I need to find my own path too.

351
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,350
Ever since I was little, I thought

352
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:25,410
I could follow our father and brothers to roam the world and right wrongs.

353
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,550
But I overlooked

354
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,750
that punishing evildoers and saving people

355
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,640
are equally important.

356
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,830
In my heart,

357
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
you've always been the best sister.

358
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,720
The Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood has a clinic in town.

359
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,640
The town recently had a plague outbreak.

360
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:44,960
Though it's under control now,

361
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,240
they're still short-handed.

362
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:48,000
Would you be willing to go help?

363
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,550
Don't worry, I'll do my best.

364
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:04,440
Yiren,

365
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,790
for this trip to Mount Emei's Golden Summit,

366
00:22:06,790 --> 00:22:09,070
perhaps we should travel with Qiushui.

367
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,240
It's all for our family after all.

368
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,960
Before Father and Mother's incident,

369
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,890
I was the acting leader of our sect.

370
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,440
No matter what tricks Qiushui uses now

371
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,440
to gain power,

372
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,820
our family should still be under my leadership.

373
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:22,830
Yiren,

374
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,440
Qiushui even managed to made it through the Nangong family's

375
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,400
killing banquet.

376
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,640
He must've had some adventures

377
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:30,160
these past few months that he hasn't told us about.

378
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,830
He just loves his tricks—

379
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,410
don't you understand that?

380
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,240
You stay here and hold the house.

381
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:38,680
When I return from defeating the villains at Mount Emei's Golden Summit,

382
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,720
I'll restore honor to our family.

383
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,690
Take care on your journey, Yiren.

384
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,310
You received the letter too?

385
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,000
Yeah.

386
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,790
The letter says

387
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,310
the Hero Command Token and the Voidheart Codex

388
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:02,200
have fallen into the hands of Li Chenzhou from the Power Gang.

389
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,240
This time at Emei Sect,

390
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,700
we must devise a strategy.

391
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,930
Quite a crowd has gathered.

392
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:10,030
Who would have thought the martial world could be so united now?

393
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,200
Everyone actually responded to the Emei Sect's call,

394
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,000
coming here to discuss taking down the Power Gang.

395
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,920
I wouldn't be so sure.

396
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:20,350
I heard Huanhua Sect's third son killed the Sword King.

397
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,150
That's right.

398
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,510
I always said the Power Gang was all bark, no bite.

399
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,840
After we destroy the Power Gang together,

400
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,790
we can also get a glimpse of that Hero Command Token

401
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,270
and the Voidheart Codex.

402
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,590
It seems not everyone

403
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,250
is here to fight the Power Gang

404
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,030
but rather to think about what benefits they can gain for themselves.

405
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:39,350
This martial world is rotten to the core.

406
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,030
Perhaps that's exactly why

407
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,890
the Power Gang has been thriving.

408
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:44,750
Whatever their motives,

409
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:47,680
at least our goals are aligned for now.

410
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,400
But...

411
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,090
something seems fishy about all this.

412
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,200
I hope Qiushui can

413
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,200
meet with Abbess Zhichen smoothly.

414
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:07,790
Master,

415
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,270
Xiao Qiushui of the Xiao family from Huanhua Sect requests an audience.

416
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,110
Let him in.

417
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,260
Please enter the hall.

418
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,350
I, Xiao Qiushui,

419
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,640
pay my respects to Sect Leader Zhichen.

420
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,840
Please come forward.

421
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:39,480
How could there be someone so alike?

422
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,130
Sect Leader?

423
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,550
So you are Xiao Qiushui?

424
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,030
I am indeed.

425
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,920
My sect

426
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,880
has very few disciples left now.

427
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:58,830
I often lament how weak my sect has become.

428
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,550
Yet you,

429
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:02,200
with just a few young heroes,

430
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:05,200
dealt a heavy blow to the Power Gang

431
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,790
and avenged our righteous sects.

432
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,080
You flatter me, Sect Leader.

433
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,240
I don't deserve such praise.

434
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,590
Seeing young heroes like you fighting evil,

435
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:20,200
I truly hate how my broken body fails me.

436
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:25,000
Otherwise, how could I let the Power Gang be so arrogant?

437
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,370
Tianzheng and Taichan are both gone now.

438
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,270
Even if it costs my life,

439
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,400
I must gather all martial arts allies.

440
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,750
I want to see who in this martial world is

441
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:38,780
still willing to fight the Power Gang alongside us.

442
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:42,400
Oh,

443
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,310
what brings you to me?

444
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,400
I came here

445
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,640
because of this item.

446
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,080
The Hero Command Token?

447
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:09,070
Old Madam Wu entrusted it to you?

448
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,510
Yes.

449
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,510
I had a friend

450
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,110
whose father

451
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:19,070
was injured by the techniques from the Voidheart Codex.

452
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:20,530
And this friend of mine...

453
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,680
died saving me back then.

454
00:26:28,750 --> 00:26:29,750
But now...

455
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,750
I want to save his family.

456
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,270
So...

457
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,750
you heard that the Voidheart Codex is

458
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,790
hidden within this Hero Command Token,

459
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,880
and you came to ask me about it?

460
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,270
Yes.

461
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:49,710
Please tell me, Sect Leader.

462
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,480
It's not that I don't want to help.

463
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,200
It's just

464
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,350
that the connection between the Voidheart Codex

465
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,590
and the Hero Command Token

466
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,530
is beyond my knowledge.

467
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,880
Back then, when we forged the Hero Command Token...

468
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,330
it was to resist the Northern Wasteland.

469
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,400
Crazy Yan

470
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:14,590
probably wouldn't have

471
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,520
put the Voidheart Codex inside it.

472
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,330
Though he's eccentric,

473
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:21,070
he wouldn't want the martial world

474
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:22,880
to fall into great chaos

475
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:25,210
over competing for this item.

476
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,070
The Hero Command Token was in Crazy Yan's possession,

477
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,150
yet it suddenly appeared in the martial world.

478
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:34,880
Perhaps he did this himself.

479
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,400
But, Sect Leader,

480
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:38,530
what would be his purpose?

481
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,990
If you want to find the Voidheart Codex,

482
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,880
the most direct way is to find Crazy Yan

483
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,070
and ask him directly.

484
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:51,000
But that's like finding a needle in a haystack.

485
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,330
I also have this.

486
00:27:59,310 --> 00:28:00,440
The Golden Swallow?

487
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,580
Old Madam Wu entrusted this to me.

488
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,400
She said it could help find Crazy Yan's sister.

489
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,270
I know something about this matter.

490
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:14,790
Years ago,

491
00:28:15,550 --> 00:28:18,410
Crazy Yan's fellow disciples, the Jiang brothers,

492
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,070
kidnapped Crazy Yan's young sister,

493
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,640
hoping to use her to exchange for the Voidheart Codex.

494
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,240
But the Jiang brothers didn't keep their promise

495
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,160
and fled with the girl overnight.

496
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:34,360
Later, the girl fell seriously ill

497
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,880
and nearly died.

498
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,550
I happened to pass by

499
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:39,310
and saved her.

500
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,240
After that, I don't know what happened.

501
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,910
Where is Abbess Zhichen?

502
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,210
I'm in a hurry to find Li Chenzhou!

503
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:53,750
If word gets out,

504
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:55,640
he'll hide like a coward!

505
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,510
Such offensive words

506
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,970
are better left unspoken.

507
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,800
Zhao Shirong?

508
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,350
Deputy Chief Liu?

509
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,000
Yiren?

510
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,590
The Power Gang actually dares to come here.

511
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:42,400
Mount Emei's Golden Summit is picturesque.

512
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,480
If you all can come,

513
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,880
why can't we?

514
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:45,960
You know why!

515
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,030
Mount Emei's Golden Summit has long been a righteous sanctuary.

516
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:51,720
Now you people from the Power Gang

517
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,550
have slaughtered the leaders of the Shaolin and Wudang Sects

518
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,210
and massacred my Xiao family.

519
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:59,750
You certainly shouldn't be here!

520
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,460
That's what you think,

521
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:04,270
but some people actually want us here.

522
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,280
Why waste words with her?

523
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,510
Where is Li Chenzhou?

524
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,200
Hand over both

525
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,440
the Hero Command Token

526
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,550
and the Voidheart Codex!

527
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:16,750
-Hand them over!
-Hand them over!

528
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:23,590
This cloak was worn by that girl back then.

529
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:25,370
Then, Sect Leader,

530
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,070
do you remember

531
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,920
if she

532
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,470
had any special birthmarks?

533
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,790
I recall

534
00:30:36,790 --> 00:30:40,680
she had an apricot blossom birthmark on the back of her neck.

535
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,400
When you find her,

536
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:47,550
return this to her.

537
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,920
It would be returning it to its rightful owner.

538
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:51,680
Master!

539
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,160
What's wrong?

540
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,310
At Golden Summit Square,

541
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,510
the Power Gang came!

542
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,310
Qiushui!

543
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:04,350
It seems the Power Gang wants to disrupt this gathering.

544
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:06,790
I need to prepare

545
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:09,400
to properly welcome them.

546
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,930
In this vast martial world,

547
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,720
only a few young people have shown some courage,

548
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,000
but they can't accomplish much on their own, after all.

549
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,880
Can't accomplish much on their own?

550
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:27,790
I don't think so.

551
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,510
Zhu the Great King?

552
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,920
He even dropped his waterway business

553
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,590
and rushed here to join the commotion.

554
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:37,120
He's probably after the Voidheart Codex too.

555
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:51,160
I know that you all think

556
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,720
that I, Zhu the Great King, am just a good-for-nothing,

557
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,790
a bandit with no heroic spirit.

558
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,030
However,

559
00:31:59,030 --> 00:32:02,680
even bandits respect some code.

560
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,240
But the Power Gang's many evil deeds

561
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,640
even make me, from the Long River waterways,

562
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,840
want to seek justice.

563
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:13,160
So who's really standing alone today?

564
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,600
-That's right!
-Right!

565
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:22,110
Those words sound so righteous.

566
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,790
Too bad each of you has your own hidden agenda.

567
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:28,880
Even if you all shout about heroic spirit today,

568
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,880
tomorrow you'll be scattered like sand.

569
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,920
Don't waste your energy here.

570
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:34,830
We of the Power Gang

571
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,070
act on mutual benefit.

572
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,240
If anyone here has a wish,

573
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,150
as long as you cooperate,

574
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,920
we will do our best to help.

575
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,830
This is much more worthwhile than crying and killing

576
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,960
for empty fame.

577
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,640
What do you all think?

578
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,550
Stop this nonsense!

579
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:57,840
Everyone,

580
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,500
the Power Gang seeks to rule us with both favor and fear,

581
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,530
to temporarily suppress us

582
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,880
before making their next move.

583
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,400
Everyone, you came here today

584
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,200
and must have heard that not long ago,

585
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,680
my third brother, Xiao Qiushui, killed the Sword King

586
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,490
and severely wounded Liu Suifeng, right?

587
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:20,640
Xiao Qiushui's fame spread far because of that!

588
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:22,310
If his third brother is such a hero,

589
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,710
then he must be a hero too!

590
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:26,160
According to what the Power Gang says,

591
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,920
my family has been massacred,

592
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,460
with no prestige left.

593
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,270
If the rest of us obediently submitted,

594
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,880
we could still live quietly in a corner of Jindu.

595
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,680
But I still choose to fight them to the death!

596
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,510
I, Xiao Yiren, can let other things go,

597
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:42,160
but on this matter, I must fight.

598
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:43,590
Fight

599
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,680
against you treacherous people

600
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,680
with the unyielding heroic spirit!

601
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,750
-Well said!
-Well said!

602
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,370
Yes, that's exactly what we should do.

603
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,790
It seems you're all stubborn.

604
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:59,480
Then I must ask the two elders to step forward.

605
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:04,550
The East-West Twin Swords?

606
00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:06,400
The famous East-West Twin Swords

607
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,460
have actually joined the Power Gang?

608
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,360
So the once-mighty East-West Twin Swords,

609
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,920
who disappeared without a trace,

610
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,920
have joined your Power Gang.

611
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:20,570
What a coincidence.

612
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,030
My humble Long River waterways

613
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,260
also have two great masters hidden away.

614
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,360
East-West Twin Swords, it's been a while.

615
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:39,110
After we jointly attacked Crazy Yan back then,

616
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,840
we couldn't find you anywhere.

617
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,110
We never expected

618
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,320
that you'd cower in the Power Gang!

619
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,190
Come on!

620
00:34:45,550 --> 00:34:47,070
Let us fight again!

621
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,880
The title of the greatest fighters outside the Central Plains

622
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,400
belongs to us.

623
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,400
Zhang Canjin, Wan Suiyu,

624
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:55,070
after all these years, you're still lost in foolish dreams.

625
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,590
What a pair of persistent pests!

626
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:57,650
You cowardly rats,

627
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,930
how dare you speak such nonsense here?

628
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:06,480
Greetings to the two venerable monks

629
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,880
and the two Taoist masters.

630
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,320
The heads of the Shaolin Sect's Discipline Hall

631
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,150
and the masters of the Wudang Sect's Zixiao Palace have all come.

632
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:13,630
The Power Gang won't get off lightly today.

633
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,880
It's quite lively here,

634
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,480
with so many distinguished masters gathered.

635
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,630
Where is

636
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,110
Liu Suifeng

637
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:24,590
of the Power Gang?

638
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,070
That would be me.

639
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,320
Mr. Liu,

640
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:33,040
you killed our sect leader in the Huanhua Sect.

641
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,440
Today, we must take you back to the sect to answer for your crimes!

642
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,070
Muye,

643
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,080
don't reason with an animal.

644
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,340
We'll take his head

645
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,950
to honor our Wudang Sect!

646
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,000
This is...

647
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,530
My father's...

648
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:32,090
My father's sword sheath.

649
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:54,930
Where are they?

650
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,630
- Let's go.
- Let's go look.

651
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:03,490
Let's go check.

652
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,550
Shirong.

653
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,190
Suifeng,

654
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:08,480
leave this to me.

655
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,800
Liu Suifeng is gone,

656
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,840
and without the East-West Swords,

657
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:34,360
the Power Gang only has you left, Zhao Shirong!

658
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,840
You're all alone with no backup now.

659
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:38,320
Zhao Shirong,

660
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:41,080
do you still dare to be arrogant at this point?

661
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,790
Quickly, seize Zhao Shirong

662
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,920
and use her to exchange for the Voidheart Codex

663
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,920
from Li Chenzhou!

664
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,110
Wait.

665
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,590
You all came to the Golden Summit,

666
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,760
claiming to uphold justice and heroic spirit.

667
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,220
Now that you see I'm alone,

668
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,760
are you planning to gang up on me?

669
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,310
I understand what you're all thinking.

670
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,280
You want to use your numbers against me,

671
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,400
but still have to keep up appearances.

672
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,070
Since all you heroes

673
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,200
have gathered here,

674
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,760
let me offer you a way out.

675
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,840
I, of the Power Gang,

676
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,200
will fight each of you masters in turn.

677
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,880
If you win,

678
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:23,030
I will surrender without resistance.

679
00:38:23,030 --> 00:38:24,550
But if I win,

680
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:28,150
I ask that you grant us one request.

681
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,800
Agreed?

682
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,320
Everyone here is a renowned hero.

683
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:43,250
Surely you're not afraid to fight me, a woman, in turns?

684
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,310
What is there to fear?

685
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:47,890
I, Xiao Yiren of the Huanhua Sect,

686
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,800
accept your challenge!

687
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:50,800
Good.

688
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,000
Another "R" signature.

689
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:19,880
Could it be him?

690
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,380
Respected elders,

691
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,130
are you all alright?

692
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:15,630
Who are you, young hero?

693
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,860
I'm Xiao Qiushui of the Huanhua Sect.

694
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:25,320
So you're the son of our old friend.

695
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,410
We've all heard about what happened to your family.

696
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,230
Now,

697
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:36,090
the eight of us have fought to exhaustion.

698
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:38,080
We're all at the end of our strength

699
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:41,360
and unlikely to survive today.

700
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,380
I'm willing to pass all my lifelong martial arts skills

701
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,550
and secret techniques to you.

702
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:47,150
Elder.

703
00:40:47,710 --> 00:40:49,970
To prove to those four old scoundrels...

704
00:40:50,590 --> 00:40:51,280
No,

705
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,670
to prove to the entire world

706
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:56,320
who practices orthodox martial arts!

707
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,720
To rid the martial world of evil!

708
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:02,280
Our meridians are damaged,

709
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,030
but we must avenge our grievances!

710
00:41:06,590 --> 00:41:08,440
Kill those scoundrels for me!

711
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,310
Elder, please don't do that.

712
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,190
I am not a disciple of your sect,

713
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:13,920
so how could I learn your orthodox techniques?

714
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,400
Passing on skills is a matter of fate,

715
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:19,440
not necessarily requiring the same sect or lineage.

716
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,030
If you have the talent,

717
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:24,590
then accept our legacies.

718
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,800
Amitabha.

719
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:30,440
Young man,

720
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,430
you have no choice!

721
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,280
El...

722
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,000
Elders. Elders!

723
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:50,360
Elders!

724
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,110
Watch out!

725
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:14,800
Young hero,

726
00:42:15,510 --> 00:42:17,110
I'm passing all my lifelong internal energy and secret techniques

727
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,230
to you completely!

728
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,480
Kill him for me!

729
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,480
Boy.

730
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,480
I'm also transferring my internal energy to you.

731
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,960
Let's see whose skills are more powerful!

732
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,840
-We're giving you our energy too!
-We're giving you our energy too!
