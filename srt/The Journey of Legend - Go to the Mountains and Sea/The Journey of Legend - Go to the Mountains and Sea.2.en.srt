[The Journey of Legend]

00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,830
[Episode 2]

3
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,280
Do you know

4
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:54,120
who's behind the Gold and Silver Bank?

5
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:56,880
Who is it?

6
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:00,280
Fu Tianyi, the demon of the Power Gang.

7
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,460
So what if it's him?

8
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:06,400
Big Brother, you always say
we should uphold justice.

9
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,000
You're the bravest of us all.

10
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,030
Why do I feel like

11
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,610
you're a different person today?

12
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,490
It's actually because...

13
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,800
Because...

14
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:22,960
I got it!

15
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,520
It's because the Power Gang
has never meddled in Jinzhong.

16
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,680
Big Brother is worried

17
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,140
that if we're discovered,

18
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,079
they'll have

19
00:02:31,079 --> 00:02:33,360
a reason to attack
the martial world of Jinzhong, right?

20
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,000
That's why
you want us to launch a sneak attack,

21
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:36,750
right?

22
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,030
I guess I'm a bit lucky.

23
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,470
Yes.

24
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,800
It seems Rou

25
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,160
understands me best.

26
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,960
That's exactly it.

27
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,400
As expected of Big Brother.

28
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,590
You think on such a grand scale.

29
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,960
I agree.

30
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,860
Big Brother, don't worry.

31
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,120
Before we met you,

32
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,400
we were just

33
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,840
three young punks
who practiced martial arts all day.

34
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,240
You guided us to start upholding justice.

35
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,910
Whatever you want to do,

36
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:10,030
just make the decision.

37
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,360
We'll follow your lead.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,530
Alright.

39
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,020
Then let's do this.

40
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,720
Tomorrow,

41
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,480
we'll set out for Zihui.

42
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,280
Okay!

43
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:20,840
Okay!

44
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:29,079
Oh, no. I just remembered.

45
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,220
In the original story,

46
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,370
that was where Tang Rou
suffered a sneak attack.

47
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,210
Oh right, Tang Rou.

48
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,360
I don't think you should participate

49
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,560
in this mission.

50
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,630
Why?

51
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
It's because...

52
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,400
I met a fortune teller
a couple of days ago

53
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,350
who did a divination for you.

54
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:59,680
It showed that this trip
would bring more harm than good to you.

55
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,810
It'll be dangerous.

56
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:06,400
Hey.

57
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:08,630
Why are you laughing?

58
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,970
I'm telling the truth!

59
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,630
-Big Brother.
-Big Brother.

60
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,010
Are you being serious?

61
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,010
Big Brother,

62
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,750
when have our heroic deeds
ever been without danger

63
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,120
Besides, even if I, Tang Rou, were afraid,

64
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,270
the Rainstorm Pear Blossom Needles
at my waist certainly aren't.

65
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:23,870
Hey guys,

66
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,120
can't you be a little less reckless?

67
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,650
I'm being serious with you!

68
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,950
Big Brother, why are you being so fussy?

69
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,330
Did that fortune teller
put a curse on you or something?

70
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,920
Forget it.
Let's take it one step at a time.

71
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,830
I should have read
the original story more carefully.

72
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,490
[Zihui]

73
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:55,750
Come on.

74
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,450
Take it slow.

75
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:58,310
Here.

76
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,690
Careful. Thank you.

77
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,160
Thank you. Take care, you two.

78
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,760
-We're leaving.
-Take care.

79
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,750
Don't worry, madam.

80
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,600
-We'll be there soon.
-Alright.

81
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,240
One basket of steamed buns
and four bowls of beef noodles.

82
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,700
Certainly. Just a moment.

83
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,240
Have a seat, Big Brother.

84
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:11,600
This way.

85
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,160
Big Brother.

86
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,600
Here, have some tea first.

87
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,750
Bravo!

88
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,390
Here.

89
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:20,800
These steamed buns look quite good.

90
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,360
Bravo!

91
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,120
Drink some water.

92
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,830
-Move, move!
-!t's too hot today.

93
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,920
What are you looking at?

94
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,510
Move aside.

95
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,070
Move!

96
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,360
Move, move!

97
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,290
Everyone, move!

98
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:30,840
Hurry up.

99
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,000
This... this...

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,870
What's going on? What are you doing?

101
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:35,430
Behave yourself.

102
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,240
Let me go!

103
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,530
-Move!
-What are you doing?

104
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,430
Please spare me, sir!

105
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:41,510
Please have mercy, sir!

106
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,970
I'll give you one more day.

107
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,240
Tomorrow at noon,

108
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,390
if you don't deliver the money
to the Gold and Silver Bank,

109
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,750
I'll burn this shabby boat of yours
to the ground.

110
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,310
Stop!

111
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,300
What are you doing?

112
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:58,430
What's the matter? Want to be a hero?

113
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,240
So what if I do?

114
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,400
Sir, please don't fight!

115
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,430
Please don't fight!

116
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,270
If a fight breaks out here,

117
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,750
my business will be ruined.

118
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,600
That's right.

119
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,550
Did you hear that, young man?

120
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,270
They're going to save them?

121
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,000
One day.

122
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,600
-Yes, yes, yes, sir.
-Just one day.

123
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,130
Let's go.

124
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,720
Let's go.

125
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:17,000
Are you two alright, gentlemen?

126
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
-Thank you, sirs.
-Thank you, sirs.

127
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,720
Tang Rou, why don't you go ask

128
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,180
and see what's going on
with that boat captains over there?

129
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,720
Captain, what's wrong?

130
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,680
Don't mention it.
We scraped together all our savings

131
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,360
and finally managed to buy a boat

132
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,560
just to make a living.

133
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,340
In the past,

134
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,950
we used to pay tribute
to Zhu the Great King of the waterway.

135
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,430
Now, we're using
the river's branch routes,

136
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,750
and we're being extorted
by the Gold and Silver Bank.

137
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,430
The war has just eased for a few years.

138
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,890
How can we make any profit?

139
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,510
We can't keep this business going
like this.

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,400
The Gold and Silver Bank?

141
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,120
Them again?

142
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,430
Why is this Gold and Silver Bank
so tyrannical?

143
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,690
No one in the Wubei area

144
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,800
dares to offend the Gold and Silver Bank.

145
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,390
They can make life

146
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:06,480
more miserable than death.

147
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,480
Indeed.

148
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,430
Here it is.

149
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,280
The NPCs are here
to push the plot forward.

150
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,510
Let's not talk about it anymore.

151
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:14,680
Let's go, let's go.

152
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,770
Let's go.

153
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,360
Big Brother, it seems your lead
was right.

154
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,160
They're such bullies.

155
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,420
Big Brother, we must pay a visit
to the Gold and Silver Bank.

156
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:28,800
Yes.

157
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,830
Is there such a rush?

158
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,490
We need to plan this out.

159
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,750
Besides, the noodles
haven't even been served yet.

160
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,680
Come on, sit down and eat.

161
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,920
What's there to plan? Let's go, let's go!

162
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,630
-What plan?
-It's too late.

163
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,390
Let's go, Big Brother.

164
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:41,950
Let's go.

165
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,360
But I'm hungry.

166
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:43,950
Let's go.

167
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:44,630
Your sword!

168
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,800
Big Brother, this way please.

169
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,190
Sir,

170
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,600
-your beef noodles...
-No need anymore!

171
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,530
What's going on?

172
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:55,940
[Gold and Silver Bank]

173
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,440
It's right here.

174
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,360
Come on.

175
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,630
Brothers, come on, take these.

176
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,010
Once we're inside,

177
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,430
remember, don't reveal your identities
no matter what.

178
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:13,690
Put these on properly.

179
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,240
Big Brother, we're here to uphold justice.

180
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,160
No need.

181
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,600
That's right, let's go.

182
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:22,310
You won't wear them for night operations?
Put them on!

183
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:22,830
Take it.

184
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,430
Um,

185
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,470
those buns aren't sitting well with me.

186
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,560
I need to use the toilet.

187
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,070
You all need to be extra careful.

188
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,570
Don't go, don't go.

189
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,730
You're pulling this trick again,
aren't you?

190
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,080
I know what you're doing.

191
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,390
You're doing the same thing as last time,

192
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,150
trying to send us away

193
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:45,360
so you can face
the strong enemy alone, right?

194
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,960
Big Brother, let me tell you,

195
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,870
it's absolutely not happening this time.

196
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:49,670
That's right.

197
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,560
I'm not joking with you guys.

198
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,430
Anyway, I'm telling you,

199
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,290
it's very dangerous in there.

200
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,360
You must be extremely careful.

201
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,240
Do you understand?

202
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,040
Please, please be very careful.

203
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:04,080
There's nothing we can do about him.
Let's go.

204
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,510
What do you mean?

205
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:07,440
I'm talking to you guys.

206
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,570
Where are you going?

207
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,350
Isn't the entrance right there?

208
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
Big Brother, make way.

209
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:16,840
W-What are you doing?

210
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,480
Move aside.

211
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,780
What are you doing?

212
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:32,940
Oh my goodness!

213
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,250
They really can fly.

214
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,600
How about

215
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,910
I give it a try?

216
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,080
No way,

217
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,500
I don't have any lightness skills at all.

218
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,440
This is today's rent from Hehan Street.

219
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:04,150
This is the tribute from the 18 shops
at the street corner today.

220
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,150
Good, good, good.

221
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:07,510
That woman from the gold shop
said business was bad.

222
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:09,440
She was crying and refusing to pay.

223
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,910
I dragged her back here.

224
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,550
Boss,

225
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,120
what do you want to do with her?

226
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,320
Blind her

227
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,910
and throw her in the marketplace

228
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,640
to set an example for everyone.

229
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,630
Who dares

230
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,250
to cause trouble
at the Gold and Silver Bank?

231
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,220
Do you know who the owner
of this place is?

232
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,880
Isn't it Fu Tianyi, the Iron-Fisted Demon
of the Power Gang?

233
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,600
Since you know,

234
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,030
why are you still here?

235
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,610
Not only are we not leaving,

236
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,530
but we're also going to

237
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,200
eliminate

238
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,270
you

239
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:55,940
trouble

240
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,630
makers.

241
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,960
That's quite a bold statement.

242
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,000
Chop them into pieces

243
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,530
and throw them into the river
to feed the fish!

244
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,360
Are we really doing this?

245
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,030
Zuoqiu's silk-binding
grappling technique is impressive.

246
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:47,160
Clean and powerful.

247
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,200
As fellow swordsmen,

248
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,630
Yuhan's Hailin Sword Sect's technique
is known for its intricacy.

249
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:55,030
His lethality is not to be underestimated.

250
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:57,770
Flying daggers.

251
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,480
The Tang Sect's hidden weapons
are indeed formidable.

252
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,670
No wonder the Tang Sect
has stood strong for a century.

253
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,440
My underlings are quite impressive.

254
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,840
Blood... It really is blood.

255
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,060
Where is Fu Tianyi?

256
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:40,930
I don't know.

257
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:06,870
Escaping is the best strategy of all.

258
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,600
Staying alive is the priority.

259
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,030
Be careful.

260
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:14,970
Alright.

261
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:21,270
Hey.

262
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:24,670
Captain,

263
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,170
where are you heading?

264
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,550
Sir, you are...

265
00:13:29,790 --> 00:13:31,080
Don't you remember?

266
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:34,790
Yesterday at the dock,
when you were being bullied,

267
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:37,080
my brothers and I came to your rescue.

268
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,750
-Oh, it's you, young hero.
-Yes, yes.

269
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,870
It's the young hero.

270
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,470
Young hero, you may not know,

271
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,440
but we've gathered some silver

272
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:46,240
and are about to deliver it
to the Gold and Silver Bank.

273
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,750
Yes, we hope they'll show mercy

274
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,720
and forgive us.

275
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,520
That's right.

276
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,840
You don't need to go anymore.

277
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,390
Someone has already
eliminated the threat for you.

278
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,440
How is that possible?

279
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,910
That's the Power Gang's
Gold and Silver Bank!

280
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,870
Indeed.

281
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,630
Don't worry.

282
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,670
No one will bully you anymore.

283
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:12,390
Ah...

284
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,150
-Thank you, young hero.
-Thank you, young hero.

285
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:15,910
Hurry and go.

286
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:16,630
Lad.

287
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,910
You hired people to wipe out
the Gold and Silver Bank?

288
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,320
Well done!

289
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,750
That Gold and Silver Bank
was utterly heartless,

290
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,440
committing numerous crimes.
It should've been destroyed long ago.

291
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,240
Stop talking!

292
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,090
Young hero!

293
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,360
You talk too much.

294
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,190
A man fishing in the wind and rain

295
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,360
on the huge rock at the riverside dock...

296
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,120
He's the Iron-Fisted Demon, Fu Tianyi?

297
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,340
[Iron-Fisted Demon of the Power Gang]
[Fu Tianyi]

298
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,560
I've already run so far away.

299
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,490
How can I still run into him?

300
00:15:07,870 --> 00:15:09,910
This plot twist feels too forced.

301
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,050
You go first.

302
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
Okay, okay, okay.

303
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,900
Don't move.

304
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,170
Kneel down, kneel down.

305
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:27,510
Behave yourself.

306
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:28,510
Kneel!

307
00:15:31,990 --> 00:15:33,510
[Northern Wasteland Seal]

308
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:33,390
I never expected

309
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,360
the Gold and Silver Bank would
conspire with Northern Wastelanders.

310
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,000
But these people are too tight-lipped.

311
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,910
We can't get them to reveal
the mastermind's whereabouts.

312
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,170
We've fought all night

313
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,670
but still can't find
the Iron-Fisted Demon's whereabouts.

314
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,000
These three young heroes
are incredibly skilled.

315
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,840
Did you see?

316
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,740
They destroyed
the entire Gold and Silver Bank.

317
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,390
Tang Rou.

318
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:01,270
There's something I must tell you.

319
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,150
What is it?

320
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,530
Be careful of...

321
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,070
What's wrong?

322
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,600
It's nothing.

323
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,410
Remember this.

324
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,530
You must be wary
of someone holding an umbrella.

325
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:21,810
Someone holding an umbrella.

326
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:24,740
Come on, you're really
being superstitious now.

327
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:25,600
Well...

328
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,120
Besides,

329
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:30,970
it doesn't even look like
it's going to rain.

330
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,360
Can you be more serious?

331
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,690
I'm not joking with you.

332
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,440
Remember what I said. The key point is,

333
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,750
be careful of someone holding an umbrella.

334
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:37,810
Do you understand?

335
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,970
Everyone has an umbrella.

336
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:42,210
Who am I supposed to be wary of?

337
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,270
Exactly.

338
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,840
These villains deserve to be
dealt with properly.

339
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,500
The rain stopped so suddenly.

340
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,440
The rain has stopped.

341
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,700
The rain has stopped.
Who would still be using an umbrella?

342
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,030
Make way!

343
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:53,230
Heaven is on our side.

344
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,480
The constables are here!
The constables are here!

345
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,670
They should all be arrested.

346
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,240
Take them all away.

347
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:57,840
These are the villains.

348
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,270
Yes, arrest them all.

349
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,270
Arrest these beasts!

350
00:17:02,270 --> 00:17:02,630
Don't move!

351
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,430
That's right.

352
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,220
Who are you people?

353
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,030
We're here to rid the people of harm.

354
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,720
You government-paid officials
finally show up now.

355
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,920
May I ask the names
of you righteous heroes?

356
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,680
We are...

357
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,589
There's no need to know our names.

358
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:18,480
Those scoundrels
are locked up in the back.

359
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,010
You can just take them away.

360
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:23,720
The Gold and Silver Bank has been
exploiting the people for a long time.

361
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,240
As a mere constable,

362
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,410
I've never dared to take action.
I'm truly ashamed.

363
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:29,880
But I'm afraid

364
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,310
you've only caught some small fry.

365
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,100
The real boss, however...

366
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,400
Do you know where their real boss is?

367
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,160
You need to understand.
If you don't tell us now,

368
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
you'll be the ones

369
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,700
in trouble after we leave.

370
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,510
Alright, I'll take you there.

371
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:08,690
Oh my goodness!

372
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:48,840
Isn't that our Big Brother?

373
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,960
-Big Brother!
-So Big Brother found Fu Tianyi already.

374
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,020
What did I tell you?

375
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,620
He ran off on his own again.

376
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,920
Don't come over! It's dangerous!

377
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,660
Big Brother, don't worry!

378
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,240
We won't interfere.

379
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:05,210
We'll leave
the toughest Iron-Fisted Demon to you.

380
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,350
Big Brother, you've got this!

381
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,270
Beat him up!

382
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,030
Come on, Big Brother!

383
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,200
You pig-headed fools!

384
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,880
What kind of encouragement is this?

385
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,080
Come on, Big Brother!

386
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,280
-Come on!
-Come on, Big Brother!

387
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:49,280
Huanhua Sword Technique, Second Form:
Soaring to the Heavens!

388
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,180
Third Form: Plucking Petals and Leaves!

389
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,960
Fourth Form: Starry Sky!

390
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,070
Big Brother! Big Brother!

391
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,030
Are you hurt? Are you okay?

392
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:09,960
Are you alright?

393
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:11,960
I'm fine.

394
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,310
So my subconscious mind

395
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,640
remembers the martial arts
this body practiced before.

396
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,000
Huanhua Sword Technique.

397
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,350
Since when did Xiao Xilou's people

398
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,000
dare to oppose the Power Gang?

399
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,200
I heard you killed my men.

400
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,830
Then stay and fill the vacancies.

401
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,480
Work for me.

402
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,170
You won't refuse, will you?

403
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:50,590
What do you think?

404
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,270
Of course we're not willing.

405
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,130
You think you can order us around?

406
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,070
How could you all be a match for me?

407
00:21:02,110 --> 00:21:04,240
One-on-one, of course we're not.

408
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,960
But four against one is a different story.

409
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,590
You think you have four people?

410
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,000
It's not a guess. It's a fact.

411
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,920
What if I make you lose one person?

412
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,160
One less... Tang Rou!

413
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,270
It's you!

414
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,530
Are you alright?

415
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,960
Tang Rou.

416
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,940
Good thing I have this.

417
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,960
Here, take this.

418
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,170
For self-defense.

419
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,480
Underwear?

420
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:55,830
This isn't my size.

421
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,680
Tie it around you.

422
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:05,640
No one can ambush
a member of the Tang Sect.

423
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:07,920
Remember that.

424
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:11,640
Not one of us four will be missing.

425
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,310
Then you four...

426
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:17,830
can prepare to die!

427
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,810
-Big Brother!
-Big Brother!

428
00:23:09,550 --> 00:23:10,160
Charge!

429
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,960
Kill!

430
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,170
Is everyone alright?

431
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,790
We're fine.

432
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,720
The Iron-Fisted Demon
lives up to his name.

433
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,810
He's truly impervious to weapons.

434
00:23:54,110 --> 00:23:56,480
Fu Tianyi's hands are impenetrable.

435
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,000
Tang Rou, Yuhan,

436
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,030
restrain his arms!

437
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:02,760
Zuoqiu, attack his lower body!

438
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,400
Go!

439
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,740
This move, the Flower Rain Sword,

440
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,550
uses the blade as a hidden weapon,

441
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:17,400
and the scabbard as the killing blow.

442
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,530
It's truly amazing.

443
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,350
He's dead.

444
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,550
Big Brother, he's dead!

445
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:29,890
Big Brother!

446
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,310
We... We won!

447
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,000
We won!

448
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:41,920
Tang Rou,

449
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,850
thank goodness you're still here.

450
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:47,330
Of course I'm here.

451
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,680
I... I actually used
the Xiao family's martial arts

452
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,110
to kill Fu Tianyi?

453
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,790
Of course you used martial arts.

454
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,450
What else could you have used?

455
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:04,720
It seems

456
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,980
this Power Gang isn't all that great.

457
00:26:07,070 --> 00:26:09,200
Today, we killed the Iron-Fisted Demon.

458
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,140
Tomorrow, we can kill
the Eight Heavenly Kings

459
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:12,620
and the Nineteen Demons.

460
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:15,160
That's right, let's kill them all!

461
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,160
Eight Heavenly Kings, Nineteen Demons...

462
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,240
Oh right, in the original story,
the Power Gang

463
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,300
discovered that we killed Fu Tianyi,

464
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:24,000
so they besieged the Xiao family.

465
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:24,660
This is bad.

466
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:27,960
Yuhan, Chaoran,

467
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,480
go get some money

468
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:31,430
to silence that boatman.

469
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,390
Tang Rou, go buy a small boat

470
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:35,990
and get some lamp oil.

471
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,790
Why?

472
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,400
What do you mean "why?" Just go quickly!

473
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,030
Don't ask so many useless questions!

474
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,830
Go!

475
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:41,590
Let's go.

476
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:48,810
Someone really died.

477
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:51,680
I...

478
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:55,200
What... What have I done?

479
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,720
Are we destroying evidence?

480
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,440
Brothers,

481
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,400
don't think too much now.

482
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,270
It's perfect timing to leave Zihui

483
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:13,640
before it gets dark.

484
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,030
Let's go, let's go.

485
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:15,560
Let's go.

486
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,890
Sirs, your dishes are all here.

487
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:25,880
Alright.

488
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,000
Waiter.

489
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,830
Sir, please enjoy your meal.

490
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:29,480
Thank you for your hard work.

491
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,480
[Everlasting Prosperity]

492
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:31,830
Come on.

493
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,270
We should have run far enough by now.

494
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,870
Finally, we can eat in peace.

495
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,440
Chopsticks.

496
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,400
Let's eat.

497
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:38,210
Come on.

498
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,200
By the way,

499
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:44,750
we clearly did the martial world a favor
by eliminating evil.

500
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,400
Why are we acting like criminals?

501
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,930
That's right, Big Brother.

502
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,310
Come here, come here.

503
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,030
Why else could it be?

504
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,290
I'm afraid of dying.

505
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:57,680
Afraid of dying?

506
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:00,030
W-When have we ever been afraid of death?

507
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,550
Yeah.

508
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:05,030
I've known you for so many years.

509
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:08,430
It's the first time I've heard you say
you're afraid of dying.

510
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,900
Are you sick or something?

511
00:29:22,790 --> 00:29:23,850
Come on, everyone.

512
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:29,830
Let me ask you,

513
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:34,400
Is it more worthwhile
to kill one or 10 villains?

514
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,830
Killing 10, of course.

515
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:36,630
That's right.

516
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,750
As the saying goes,

517
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:44,000
"Keep a low profile, be humble,
don't get cocky."

518
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,160
That's true.

519
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:47,880
Look,

520
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,070
the four of us

521
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:53,070
barely managed
to defeat one villain today.

522
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,300
What if the remaining evil members
of the Power Gang

523
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,070
came after us together?

524
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:03,440
We'd be finished for sure.

525
00:30:04,790 --> 00:30:05,590
So...

526
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,000
We must prepare secretly,

527
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,680
quietly build up our strength,

528
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:16,950
and then gradually eliminate evil
and protect the innocent.

529
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,250
When we have enough strength,

530
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:21,550
we can challenge the Power Gang.

531
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,830
Then we'll kill them all.

532
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,480
Come on,

533
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,620
eat up. It's on me today!

534
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,640
That makes sense.

535
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,680
I'm starving.

536
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,510
I understand now.

537
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,960
Big Brother is thinking about
building up our strength

538
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,420
to face the Power Gang head-on
in the future.

539
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:46,510
Truly a role model for our generation.
I'm impressed.

540
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,290
Well... That's not exactly what I meant.

541
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,790
I got it!

542
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,830
Big Brother, remember that thing
we talked about before?

543
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:04,290
Today is the perfect time.

544
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,310
Yes, Big Brother,

545
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:08,830
now is the right time.

546
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:09,400
Right.

547
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,200
Let's forget about this cliché plot.

548
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,240
How can we forget about it, Big Brother?

549
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,440
Three months ago, you said it yourself.

550
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,510
After we've done a truly righteous deed,

551
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:36,290
we'll officially establish
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

552
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:40,750
Tang Rou.

553
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:47,930
Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood?

554
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:51,880
Wasn't it the Four Brothers of Jinjiang?

555
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,340
Big Brother, what's wrong
with your memory?

556
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,530
You said it yourself

557
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,070
that we shouldn't limit it
to just Jinzhong.

558
00:31:58,070 --> 00:32:00,070
We should gather righteous men
from all over the world.

559
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:02,590
That's why we formed
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

560
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:05,590
Today is the birth
of the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

561
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,270
The original Xiao Qiushui
was quite rebellious, huh?

562
00:32:11,270 --> 00:32:12,830
Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood?

563
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:14,000
This name

564
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,130
is quite ambitious.

565
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:16,550
Big Brother.

566
00:32:16,550 --> 00:32:17,510
This knife...

567
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,450
-Has this knife been disinfected?
-Big Brother?

568
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:33,640
Do you have a needle?

569
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:35,450
A needle?

570
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,200
This... This knife isn't rusty, is it?

571
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,510
W-Why is everyone so intense?

572
00:32:53,310 --> 00:32:56,000
Heaven above, with the moon as witness,

573
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,530
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood
will live and die together.

574
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,310
Are they for real?

575
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,840
What's wrong, Big Brother?

576
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,410
Drink up!

577
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,000
Yes!

578
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,070
Cheers!

579
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,240
Cheers!

580
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,070
From today on,

581
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:26,600
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood
will live and die together.

582
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,640
Live and die together.

583
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,640
Yes, Big Brother!

584
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,710
Living together is fine,

585
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,140
but dying together...
that might not be necessary, right?

586
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,440
That's true.

587
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:43,270
If we ever face a life-or-death crisis,

588
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,030
I'm willing to give my chance of survival
to Big Brother.

589
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:46,680
Me too.

590
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,400
Agreed.

591
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:56,160
Why are you all
talking such nonsense so seriously?

592
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,880
Come on, stand up and talk.

593
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,280
Stand up to talk. Stop kneeling.

594
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,030
We are serious.

595
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,200
Is Xiao Qiushui...

596
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,110
really worth all this loyalty?

597
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:15,320
That year when I first left Tang Sect
and fell into a villain's trap,

598
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:17,760
it was you who risked your life
to lure away the villains,

599
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,190
allowing me to escape.

600
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,730
And at that time,

601
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,020
we were just strangers who met by chance.

602
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:27,400
Big Brother, when Chaoran and I
went out to gain experience,

603
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,400
we recklessly fought
and injured our internal energy.

604
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,460
You were just passing by at that time,

605
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:34,070
but you stayed with us in that temple
for three days and nights.

606
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,030
From that moment on,

607
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:35,840
I knew

608
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:38,840
you were the big brother
I'd follow through life and death.

609
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:42,110
The Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood
was born out of chivalry.

610
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:43,780
As long as you're here,

611
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,780
chivalry exists.

612
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:45,360
Yes.

613
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,070
Yes!

614
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:58,670
This talk is getting
more and more inauspicious.

615
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,930
What nonsense are you all talking about?

616
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:04,720
Since you all call me Big Brother,

617
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,480
it means you trust me.

618
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,750
Then as the Big Brother,

619
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,500
I have the responsibility
to take good care of you all.

620
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:18,400
So, we all need to live well.

621
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:20,630
That's right, live well.

622
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,110
Live well.

623
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:23,590
Live well.

624
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,150
Let me pour you some wine.

625
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:28,010
-Let me pour Big Brother a drink.
-Fill it up for him.

626
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:33,710
Xiao Qiushui was such a noble
and righteous young man.

627
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,810
I'm using his identity,

628
00:35:36,230 --> 00:35:37,630
so I can't let them down.

629
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,760
Okay, as long as I can
complete the mission, I can go back.

630
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:46,880
Before that, I'll protect them well.

631
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,160
You spoiled key plot points to Tang Rou,

632
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,190
affecting the direction of the story.

633
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,400
The Boiling Blood Cocoon
warning punishment begins.

634
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,150
Countdown.

635
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,760
Three, two, one.

636
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,000
The Boiling Blood Cocoon
warning punishment ends.

637
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,360
The next activation

638
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,030
will officially deplete
the user's health points.

639
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:56,810
And from now on,
the plot difficulty increases.

640
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,560
Difficulty increased?

641
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:06,310
How much more do you want to increase it?

642
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:08,590
You might as well kill me.

643
00:38:04,590 --> 00:38:06,960
I spoiled the plot to Tang Rou
and saved him,

644
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,230
which activated the Boiling Blood Cocoon.

645
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,710
If it happens again, I'll really be dead.

646
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,190
But strangely,

647
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,460
the Power Gang used Fu Tianyi's death

648
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,830
to besiege the Xiao family for revenge.

649
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:22,240
But I've already disposed of the body.

650
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:25,880
Why am I still dreaming about
the Xiao family being massacred?

651
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,680
Could it be that this isn't over?

652
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,480
Regardless, I need to be fully prepared.

653
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,220
I can't let the original story's tragedy
happen again.

654
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,540
If you can become the leader
of Huanhua Sect,

655
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,830
you can enter your own outline mode.

656
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:41,400
The Magic Codex will no longer interfere.

657
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,200
So if I become
the leader of Huanhua Sect

658
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:46,770
and eliminate the Boiling Blood Cocoon,

659
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,900
I can lead the direction of the story?

660
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,480
That would be perfect.

661
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:02,160
How exactly do I become the sect leader

662
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,000
and change the story's direction?

663
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,920
Xueyu being an adopted daughter

664
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,180
was content I created.

665
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,020
It means the Magic Codex
kept some of my characterization.

666
00:39:23,190 --> 00:39:26,150
What about the cheat mode I set up before?

667
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,030
If I remember correctly,

668
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,900
at the bottom of this river

669
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,120
is an invincible treasure sword.

670
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,890
And in the cave here,

671
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,970
there's a white wolf
skilled in martial arts.

672
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,880
In these ruins, there's a Gatling gun.

673
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,540
And most importantly,

674
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,330
I created a lucky bag NPC named Feng Lang.

675
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,070
He's highly skilled in martial arts

676
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,800
and completely obedient to me.

677
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,400
As long as
one of these cheats is still here,

678
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,800
changing the story's direction

679
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,840
will be much easier.

680
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:11,500
Tang Rou!

681
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,440
Yuhan!

682
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:14,800
Zuoqiu!

683
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,280
Wake up, wake up!

684
00:40:17,590 --> 00:40:20,390
Big Brother, aren't you
getting up a bit too early?

685
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:22,320
I'm so sleepy.

686
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:25,190
What do you mean early?
The sun's already shining on your butts.

687
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,250
Still sleeping in?

688
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,320
Big Brother, it's raining.
Do we still have to go out?

689
00:40:32,910 --> 00:40:34,760
Let me tell you,
this is called a sun shower.

690
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,160
It'll stop raining soon.

691
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,670
Come on, let's go.

692
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:44,190
♪ Ha ♪

693
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:48,330
♪ Why don't we just
live freely in the world? ♪

694
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:52,460
♪ We meet again
after crossing mountains and seas ♪

695
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,800
Big Brother, take a look at this.

696
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:57,050
♪ Heaven and earth between us,
yet never truly apart ♪

697
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:54,920
Catch!

698
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,040
The invincible magic sword?

699
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,590
Isn't this just a foot filer?

700
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,750
And that Gatling-something

701
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,030
is obviously just a chamber pot.

702
00:41:14,510 --> 00:41:16,000
And the most ridiculous thing?

703
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,000
It's this big gray wolf
that's supposed to teach martial arts.

704
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,110
Go away!

705
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,150
Why is this white wolf yellow?

706
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:30,230
The system said last night
it would increase the difficulty.

707
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:31,150
Does that mean

708
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,930
it's going to take away
all the cheats I wrote?

709
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,110
Then Feng Lang, the powerful

710
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,110
lucky bag NPC,

711
00:41:36,630 --> 00:41:38,430
definitely won't be here for me.

712
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,090
Big Brother,

713
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,380
you woke us up so early in the morning,

714
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:45,360
but you haven't told us
what we're supposed to do.

715
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:56,920
Actually, I did all this because

716
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,580
I just want to be the sect leader
of Huanhua Sect.

717
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:01,800
Sect leader?

718
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,710
Big Brother, you're not
joking with us, are you?
