[The Journey of Legend]

2
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,870
[Episode 11]

3
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,310
Miss Qing,

4
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,360
we've searched Xiao Qiushui thoroughly

5
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,890
and found nothing unusual.

6
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,590
[The Power Gang has never]

7
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,190
[replied to Song until now,]

8
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,960
[just to trap Xiao Qiushui]

9
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,140
[and obtain the Hero Command Token.]

10
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,750
[I'll definitely make him]

11
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,079
[reveal where the Hero Command Token is.]

12
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,000
Who are you?

13
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,090
Didn't Tang Fang tell you?

14
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,150
I'm her close friend in the Tang Sect,

15
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,550
and together we're known
as the beauty duo.

16
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,360
She sent me to take good care of you.

17
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,030
What did you make me take?

18
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:18,950
Even a master of peerless martial arts,

19
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,480
after taking that special pill,

20
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,000
has to do whatever I say.

21
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,470
The Hero Command Token

22
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:46,590
and all your secrets—

23
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,000
tell me everything.

24
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,280
Who are you?

25
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Xiao Qiushui…

26
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,080
Xiao Qiushui from Huanhua Sect.

27
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,959
Between Tang Fang and me,

28
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,649
who is more beautiful?

29
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,870
You…

30
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:34,990
You're a bit uglier than her.

31
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,120
What?

32
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,750
Your hand is rotting
from using too much poison.

33
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,610
-You...
-Qing!

34
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,040
Stop.

35
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:57,640
Did he say
where the Hero Command Token is?

36
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,430
Xiao Qiushui, tell me,

37
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:03,070
where is the Hero Command Token now?

38
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,680
In the Tang Sect.

39
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,800
Song, that's impossible.

40
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:15,450
I've searched both him and Tang Fang.

41
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,620
They don't have the token.

42
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:21,000
Xiao Qiushui.

43
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:23,630
Xiao Qiushui!

44
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:26,750
Tell me,

45
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,630
where in the Tang Sect
did you hide the Hero Command Token?

46
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,190
Didn't I just tell you?

47
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,560
The Hero Command Token

48
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,480
is buried in the Tang Sect.

49
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:46,270
I only remember it's in the bamboo grove.

50
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,780
Looks like this brat had a backup plan

51
00:05:52,159 --> 00:05:53,890
before entering the Tang Sect.

52
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,010
Let's go.

53
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,190
Two idiots.

54
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,330
Good thing I came prepared.

55
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:13,870
Miss Tang.

56
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,190
If I accidentally take
the Tang Sect's poison,

57
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,190
is there a cure?

58
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,000
It's not that I don't trust you.

59
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,150
Here is the antidote.

60
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:33,070
It's a treasure of the Tang Sect.

61
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,790
It's a cure for most poisons.

62
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,600
But it only lasts for 4 hours.

63
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,360
[Tang Fang never mentioned]

64
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:43,510
[there were such despicable people
in the Tang Sect.]

65
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:45,240
[I wonder how she's doing now.]

66
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:48,720
Miss!

67
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:50,510
Miss,

68
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,120
are you alright?

69
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,750
He said it was half a mile away.

70
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:15,070
We've dug around
almost every tree in this area

71
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,000
and still haven't found the token.

72
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,240
Could that Xiao boy have lied to me?

73
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,430
Impossible.

74
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,230
No one can resist
the effects of that special pill.

75
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,980
He couldn't have lied.

76
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:50,890
Xiao Qiushui, are you alright?

77
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,070
I'm fine.

78
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,790
Thankfully,
I had the antidote you gave me.

79
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,680
Let's get out of here.

80
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,480
Xiao Qiushui!

81
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:02,680
Xiao Qiushui, how dare you lie to us?

82
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,600
I didn't.

83
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,210
Did you find anything?

84
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:09,120
Fang,

85
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,870
you don't have to die

86
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,930
with this Xiao boy.

87
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,480
Beg me now.

88
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,950
If you beg me,
I'll always soften toward you.

89
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:18,920
Song!

90
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,120
Is there something wrong with him?

91
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,480
Young Master Xiao, if we've offended you,

92
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,540
please forgive us.

93
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:28,190
Actually, now that you have
the Hero Command Token,

94
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,800
what danger can really threaten you?

95
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,150
I can introduce you to my grandmother.

96
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,200
With her experience in the martial world,

97
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,750
she can help you
use the Hero Command Token wisely,

98
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,409
lift the siege on the Xiao family,
and ruin the villains' schemes.

99
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,630
Let me tell you the truth.

100
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,650
The Hero Command Token

101
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:52,930
has already been taken by the Power Gang.

102
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,120
Young Master Xiao,
you're still not being honest.

103
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,910
How do you know I'm lying?

104
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,470
Let me ask you.

105
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,370
Did the Power Gang tell you

106
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:06,720
they never got the token?

107
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:09,690
Do you really have dealings
with the Power Gang?

108
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,510
Fang, who are you to question me?

109
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:14,630
You went to the Xiao Residence

110
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,560
just to get the Hero Command Token.

111
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,020
Young Master Xiao,

112
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,030
that's the only reason
she went to the Xiao Residence.

113
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,830
You've noticed it, haven't you?

114
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,600
And, Fang,

115
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,910
I've already reported
that you brought an outsider

116
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:30,970
into the Tang Sect.

117
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,870
Why hasn't your father come to see you?

118
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:35,150
Could the rumors be true—
that he's gravely injured

119
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,410
and hasn't recovered?

120
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,630
If so, your branch of the family
will hardly hold out.

121
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:43,030
You should beg me nicely

122
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:44,510
to marry you.

123
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:49,850
Then I'll spare
your branch of the family in the future.

124
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,630
My father's internal energy
is on the verge of a breakthrough.

125
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,750
He's cultivating in seclusion.

126
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,270
What's so strange about that?

127
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,400
If you have the guts,

128
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,030
go force your way
into the sect leader's quarters!

129
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:02,030
Let's see

130
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,180
if my father would let you leave
in one piece.

131
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,960
If you don't have the guts,

132
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,600
shut up and get out of my way!

133
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:09,840
You…

134
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,200
Sorry to interrupt,

135
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,440
but is the Tang Sect

136
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,840
always so full of schemes

137
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,240
and infighting?

138
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:21,670
Yes, it is.

139
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,040
How else would one survive here?

140
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,720
Wait!

141
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:34,250
Since we've come to the Tang Sect,

142
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,390
let's follow the Tang Sect's rules.

143
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,130
Look behind you!

144
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:43,960
Run!

145
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,440
That way.

146
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:07,590
Xiao Qiushui.

147
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,750
What's wrong, Tang Fang?

148
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:12,440
I'm sorry.

149
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,720
Since we were in the Sword Manor,

150
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,910
I've been plotting to stay close to you,

151
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,910
just to find the "Voidheart Codex."

152
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,510
But you trusted me so much

153
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,840
and treated me as a friend.

154
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,500
I brought you to the Tang Sect,

155
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:26,510
hoping I'd help you save the Xiao family
so I could ask you

156
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,510
to repay my favor.

157
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,240
It was all just
for my own selfish desires.

158
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:37,800
Tang Fang,

159
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,150
I don't know
where the "Voidheart Codex" is.

160
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,510
But if we find Crazy Yan,

161
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,550
maybe we can learn

162
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,870
its whereabouts.

163
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,570
After saving my family,

164
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:48,910
if one day

165
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,000
I do find the "Voidheart Codex,"

166
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,720
I'll tell you where it is.

167
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,440
Thank you.

168
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,240
Over there!

169
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:03,650
Let's go!

170
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:10,800
No time to hesitate.

171
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,600
Jump!

172
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,440
Move aside!

173
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,250
Careful! You overshot it.

174
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,090
Your sleeve is torn.

175
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:46,630
It's torn.

176
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,440
All of you stay inside! Don't look!

177
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,480
You want to fight again?

178
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,320
I once made a vow—

179
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,270
if any man saw my body,

180
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,390
I'd kill him.

181
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:11,790
And of all people…

182
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,710
That's quite a rash vow you made.

183
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:20,840
If I hadn't pulled you just now,

184
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,700
you'd have fallen into the river.

185
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,750
Before my father became
the head of the family,

186
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,240
scoundrels from other factions
always bullied us.

187
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,510
One day, while I was bathing,

188
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,880
they barged in and harassed me.

189
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,540
My mother killed them all.

190
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,000
That day,

191
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,600
I made a vow—

192
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,630
I'd train hard,

193
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,240
and if any man saw my body again,

194
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:47,640
I'd have to kill him.

195
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,630
You should consider the circumstances
with such a deadly vow.

196
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:55,150
If it's a wicked man doing it on purpose,
you should kill him,

197
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,670
but I just saved you.

198
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,700
My mother said,

199
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,720
unless the man is my husband,

200
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,120
there are no exceptions.

201
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:15,810
Are you kidding me?

202
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,170
Anyway, that's the vow I swore.

203
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:20,610
Don't overthink it.

204
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,810
Then let me ask you something.

205
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,300
This vow you made as a child

206
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:28,630
actually has many loopholes.

207
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:31,560
If someone accidentally
glanced at your body

208
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,370
without seeing it clearly,

209
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,840
would you have to kill him too?

210
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,360
Who knows if he meant it or not?

211
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,270
I made this vow in my late mother's name.

212
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,400
I'll never break it.

213
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,050
You're insane. What kind of logic is that?

214
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:50,280
I'm not going to argue with you.

215
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,550
Then tell me this:

216
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:52,720
don't you consider me a friend?

217
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,120
You'd even kill a friend?

218
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,660
I already told you,

219
00:14:56,150 --> 00:14:57,360
no exceptions.

220
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,620
I don't want to fight with you.

221
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,480
You'd better step aside.

222
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:14,670
No way.

223
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,360
Excuse me, you two.

224
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:29,000
I've been listening to you for a while

225
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,460
and can't take it anymore.

226
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,320
You don't want to die, do you?

227
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,360
You don't want to kill him, do you?

228
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,810
Isn't there another solution?

229
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,580
You just need to marry her.

230
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:46,750
Miss,

231
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,960
I can see

232
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,600
you can't bring yourself to do it.

233
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,030
But you can't stay on my boat

234
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,030
forever, can you?

235
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,150
M-Me? Marry her?

236
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,240
She's right.

237
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,770
If you want to live, there's only one way.

238
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,150
Marry me.

239
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,320
Stop fooling around.

240
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,980
Marriage isn't child's play.

241
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,480
How can you just ask me

242
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,480
to marry you?

243
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,400
I can't break my vow anyway.

244
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:17,330
I still have many things to do.

245
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,150
I can't kill you for now.

246
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,440
But as it happens,

247
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:24,440
I need someone to help me

248
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,080
break into the Snare Formation
of the Tang Sect.

249
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,510
Only then can I get Tang Song off my back.

250
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,970
Otherwise, I'll have to...

251
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,360
I can help you with that.

252
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,360
But you're right.

253
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,910
I gave Rou my word.

254
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:52,150
Is the Snare Formation difficult
to break through?

255
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:58,550
It's basically a death trap.

256
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,890
If you can make it out alive,

257
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,910
we'll hold a wedding ceremony.

258
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,369
Afterward, I'll just divorce you.

259
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:10,810
Just don't make decisions on your own.

260
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,890
It's settled then.

261
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:16,589
Sorry for holding up
your wedding procession.

262
00:17:16,589 --> 00:17:19,450
This money is both compensation
and a wedding gift.

263
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:21,720
Congratulations on your wedding.

264
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,510
I wish you a long and happy marriage.

265
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,640
May you be blessed with children soon!

266
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,000
Stop looking.
It has nothing to do with you.

267
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,660
We need to hurry to Guangling.

268
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,640
How are you going?

269
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,570
Do you have a map?

270
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,030
A map of Jinzhong?

271
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,880
These red dots must be
the hidden lookout posts.

272
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,340
I went to Tang Song's place

273
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,240
to see you but couldn't find you.

274
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,510
I saw him locking this in a drawer.

275
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,640
He said

276
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,440
he spent a lot of effort and time

277
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,440
marking all the strongholds

278
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,680
of the Power Gang.

279
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,870
I guess these sects marked in red

280
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,170
have all aligned themselves
with the Power Gang.

281
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,590
Look, these strongholds

282
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,160
are all on the main routes to Guangling.

283
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,640
I can't believe
the Wuhupeng Sect, the Tanglang Sect,

284
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,370
and the Wuyi Gang

285
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,700
have all submitted to the Power Gang.

286
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,680
With these sects in the way,

287
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:52,310
Yiren's reinforcements
from Guangling to the Sword Manor

288
00:18:52,310 --> 00:18:53,590
will be hindered.

289
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,880
He'll have to take a detour.

290
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,680
If that's not possible,

291
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,610
we'll need to find a way

292
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,180
to clear these obstacles.

293
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:04,890
It's decided then.

294
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,030
And don't forget—

295
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,920
once the Sword Manor is safe,

296
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,270
you must go challenge the formation,

297
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:11,030
or I'll have to take your life.

298
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,920
As for that,

299
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,680
we need to think about it carefully.

300
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,590
Don't overthink it.

301
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,850
Let fate decide.

302
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:23,560
Let's go.

303
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,030
Spread the word

304
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,000
that Xiao Qiushui and Tang Fang

305
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,200
have taken
the Hero Command Token to Guangling.

306
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,260
You want everyone to know about that?

307
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,350
They think they can escape my grasp.

308
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:43,750
It won't be that easy.

309
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,480
Once the news spreads,

310
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:49,220
people from the martial world
will go after Xiao Qiushui.

311
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,000
I'd like to see how long he can last.

312
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,260
[Xiao Residence]

313
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,350
Kaiyan.

314
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,440
Xueyu?

315
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,790
You may leave now.

316
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,030
Any messages
from the Sword Manor in Jindu?

317
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,160
What did Father say?

318
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,070
These are all messages from our men

319
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,530
at the ferry stops
confirming their safety.

320
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,030
Father hasn't replied.

321
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:19,160
I'm afraid that as time passes,

322
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,680
all the clues and evidence in the village

323
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,680
will be wiped out.

324
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:24,310
Let's go to that village again.

325
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,680
We should examine everything carefully

326
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,210
and preserve the evidence.

327
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:28,840
Alright.

328
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,610
These herbs are used for pill-making.

329
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,240
Perhaps we can develop

330
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,370
an antidote for the villagers.

331
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,900
Xueyu!

332
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,180
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

333
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,940
Let's check on Kaiyan.

334
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,440
Kaiyan.

335
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,620
His internal energy
is temporarily blocked.

336
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:47,880
It's nothing serious.

337
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,520
Kaiyan.

338
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,070
Kaiyan.

339
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,580
What happened?

340
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:52,480
Are you okay?

341
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,270
What happened to me?

342
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,800
If I hadn't arrived in time,

343
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,510
you two would've been dead by now.

344
00:21:56,510 --> 00:21:58,000
How many times have I told you

345
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,200
not to act on your own?

346
00:21:59,350 --> 00:22:00,720
That person in black just now

347
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,540
must have come to destroy evidence.

348
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:04,000
We couldn't just stand by.

349
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,230
I've told you before—

350
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,110
we must look at the bigger picture
and prioritize the Xiao family.

351
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,440
Even if you find
the evidence now, so what?

352
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,160
Will the Power Gang actually
reason with us?

353
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,030
In the end, it'll just put

354
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:19,440
the Xiao family in open conflict
with the Power Gang.

355
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,310
Yiren.

356
00:22:33,790 --> 00:22:34,960
I just found this.

357
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,880
This snake-needle grass

358
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,210
looks very similar to the diamond flower.

359
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,270
The villagers' poisoning and madness

360
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,670
might be related to this.

361
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,750
Yiren, Xueyu has a healer's compassion

362
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,510
and is eager to save lives.

363
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,040
But that was close just now.

364
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:51,400
That man's internal energy
was overwhelming.

365
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,880
He almost killed the two of us.

366
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,400
We should just wait for Father's message

367
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,820
and follow his instructions.

368
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,200
I know you mean well,

369
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:02,070
but from now on,
whenever you make decisions

370
00:23:02,070 --> 00:23:03,330
or something happens,

371
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,690
talk with me first.

372
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,960
I'm not just your elder brother.

373
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,040
I'm also the acting leader
of the Huanhua Sect.

374
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,680
Your strategy actually

375
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,760
eliminated 2 Power Gang strongholds

376
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,380
and cleared a path for us.

377
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,750
The reinforcements
can go to Jinzhong without hindrance now.

378
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:30,550
Judging by when Old Madam Wu
sent the message,

379
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,200
Yiren should have

380
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,380
returned to Jinzhong
from Guangling by now.

381
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,270
Unfortunately, on our way here,

382
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,000
we haven't seen any sign of him.

383
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,510
I'm afraid
something might have gone wrong.

384
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,310
Let's do this.

385
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,690
We'll go buy a fast horse now

386
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,490
and head straight for Guangling to check.

387
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,720
These are all mules and donkeys.

388
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,750
They're not fast.

389
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,580
Sir, what do you want?

390
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,310
A donkey or a horse?

391
00:24:03,550 --> 00:24:05,350
There's a good horse over there.

392
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,640
You have a good eye, sir.

393
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,030
That's a great horse that can run

394
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:09,880
incredibly far in a day.

395
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,440
But it's a bit expensive.

396
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,590
How did you get such a fine horse?

397
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,880
I bought it, of course.

398
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:26,600
There's still a military seal
on the stirrup.

399
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
Tell me the truth.

400
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,730
Where did that horse come from?

401
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:39,130
It's fine if you don't want to tell us.

402
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:41,950
We'll have to
report it to the authorities.

403
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,280
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

404
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,980
That horse dealer said

405
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,070
he was passing by here yesterday

406
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:09,810
and saw this soldier lying dead here.

407
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,320
That's why he took the horse.

408
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,310
Sorry.

409
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,550
This is the messenger sent by Old Madam Wu

410
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,550
to Guangling to ask Yiren for help.

411
00:26:57,070 --> 00:26:58,270
With such a blockade,

412
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,240
Yiren and the others

413
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,880
probably have no idea

414
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,540
about our current situation.

415
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,030
So I need to hurry back
to meet up with Yiren.

416
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:15,550
The checkpoint ahead

417
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:18,200
is where Chuanjin and Guangling meet.

418
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:21,720
Looks like it's already
under the Power Gang's control.

419
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,480
The terrain here makes this place
hard to breach.

420
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,650
There's another ferry stop ahead.

421
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,530
It's not under the Power Gang's control.

422
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,880
Let's go there first.

423
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:37,090
The rain is heavy this season,
and the river has risen a lot.

424
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,600
It may be hard to find a ferry.

425
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,010
We still have to figure something out.

426
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:14,110
[Here lies a brave
and loyal soldier of the Wu Army]

427
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,480
Tang Song is so useless.

428
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,440
Xiao Qiushui had entered the Tang Sect,

429
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,170
but he still couldn't keep him.

430
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,160
Tang Song is spreading rumors

431
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,690
that Xiao Qiushui
has the Hero Command Token.

432
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,550
I'm afraid

433
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:32,830
many people are already planning

434
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:34,230
to go after Xiao Qiushui.

435
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,790
Master, should I

436
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,050
go kill this good-for-nothing Tang Song

437
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,880
for you?

438
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:43,100
There's something more important
for you to do.

439
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:46,110
Before Xiao Qiushui
parted ways with Old Madam Wu,

440
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,080
she dismissed everyone else

441
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:49,750
and spoke with him alone.

442
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:51,200
So the Hero Command Token

443
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,060
is very likely in his possession.

444
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,090
Starting today,

445
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:57,880
whoever brings Xiao Qiushui
to the Power Gang

446
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,200
will be rewarded with the Wind Token.

447
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,400
But the Wind Token is your personal token.

448
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,720
It allows its holder
to make a request of you.

449
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,750
Chief once said

450
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,680
this token would give people
leverage over you.

451
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,110
He forbade you from using it again.

452
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:10,840
Don't worry.

453
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,110
At worst, I'll just kill the holder

454
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,770
before they make any request.

455
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:22,000
Xiao Qiushui failed
to get help in Jinzhong,

456
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,440
so he must be rushing to Guangling now.

457
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:26,970
Go after him immediately.

458
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,640
Yes.

459
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:29,880
Tang Fang…

460
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,370
Is she still with Xiao Qiushui?

461
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:34,230
Yes.

462
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,590
Feng.

463
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,350
I stole some rice cakes
from the kitchen for you.

464
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:16,150
Hurry and eat.

465
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:18,000
Don't let them find out.

466
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,210
[Guangling is the Sword King's territory.]

467
00:30:39,590 --> 00:30:41,450
[Tang Fang is also in Guangling.]

468
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,200
Fang.

469
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,310
Sir.

470
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:55,910
Take care.
Come back for more if you like it.

471
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:58,750
Here. Eat something.

472
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,590
This situation is urgent,
and time is tight.

473
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:03,510
Go check if there are any inns nearby.

474
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:04,440
I'll look over there

475
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,680
for other boatmen

476
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:09,290
and see if I can book a boat
that leaves early tomorrow morning.

477
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:10,510
Be careful.

478
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,350
[Father, Mother.]

479
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:34,290
[Are you both alright?]

480
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
[Wait for me.]

481
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,450
[I'll hurry back as soon as I can.]

482
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:46,790
Sir.

483
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,680
Are there any other

484
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,680
ferry stops or boatmen around here?

485
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:51,480
No.

486
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,680
Thanks.

487
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:56,570
Sir.

488
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,500
I heard you're looking for an inn.

489
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:01,480
There's an inn called Ferry Inn nearby.

490
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,540
There are two guys there up to no good.

491
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,750
I'm afraid your friend might get tricked.

492
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:06,480
Be careful.

493
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:16,150
[Ferry Inn]

494
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,880
Anyone here?

495
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,010
[Tie Xingyue, the Fart King]

496
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,720
Hello? Is the owner here?

497
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,670
Yes, yes.

498
00:32:29,790 --> 00:32:32,000
Are you alone, sir?

499
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,610
[Qiu Nangu, Iron Mouth]

500
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
You're the owner?

501
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:35,510
Yes, I'm the owner.

502
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,420
Is this inn converted from a cattle shed?

503
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,510
It's dirty and stinks of cow dung.

504
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,990
Can anyone stay here?

505
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,030
Sir, sir,

506
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,750
I rarely get customers,

507
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,200
so I don't clean often.

508
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,480
My apologies.

509
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,830
I'll clean it up for you right away.

510
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,560
Don't bother. I'm not staying.

511
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,680
Now that you've come in,

512
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,880
you can't leave so easily.

513
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,510
You…

514
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,790
Tie, that was some convincing acting!

515
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,000
Of course.

516
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:18,080
That girl from the Tang Sect

517
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:19,770
has powerful hidden weapons,

518
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,350
but they're no match
for your knockout powder.

519
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,810
She passed out instantly.

520
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,000
There's no one I can't knock out.

521
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,290
But speaking of which,

522
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,640
wasn't Xiao Qiushui

523
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,700
supposed to come with this Tang girl?

524
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,340
Why hasn't he shown up yet?

525
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,550
Don't worry.

526
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,720
Xiao Qiushui

527
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:42,590
will definitely come
to save this Tang girl.

528
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,190
We'll just wait here for him.

529
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,350
Exactly. Let's wait for him

530
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,530
to walk right into our trap.

531
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,960
Speak of the devil.

532
00:33:59,400 --> 00:33:59,950
Let's go.

533
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,660
Hurry!

534
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,230
Quick! Give me the antidote.

535
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:08,260
The antidote! Now.

536
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:10,760
Here.

537
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,110
Tell me,

538
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,170
who are you people?

539
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,400
I'm Tie Xingyue, the Fart King.

540
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,650
I'm Qiu Nangu, Iron Mouth.

541
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,380
You've heard of me, right?

542
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,630
Where is that girl now?

543
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,140
You're here to save that girl.

544
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,620
You're Xiao Qiushui, aren't you?

545
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,840
So you're after Xiao Qiushui.

546
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:50,480
It's not us who want him.

547
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:52,590
The Power Gang wants him.

548
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,820
Liu Suifeng from the Power Gang
has spread the word:

549
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,270
whoever brings Xiao Qiushui to him

550
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,920
will get a token in exchange.

551
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,160
That token is extremely valuable.

552
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,360
If the two of us want
to join the Power Gang,

553
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,330
he wouldn't dare refuse us.

554
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,030
So you want to side with Liu Suifeng

555
00:36:18,030 --> 00:36:19,360
and join the Power Gang?

556
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,190
Liu Suifeng's offer

557
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,800
is tempting.

558
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:24,800
But

559
00:36:25,630 --> 00:36:27,480
we've already made contact
with the Sword King

560
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,480
of the Power Gang.

561
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:30,360
Although we haven't met in person,

562
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,070
we can't switch sides so easily.

563
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:33,070
We value loyalty.

564
00:36:33,110 --> 00:36:34,480
Right. Loyalty!

565
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,350
If we hand over the person Liu Suifeng
has been looking for

566
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,320
to the Sword King,

567
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,920
the Sword King will surely be pleased.

568
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:40,630
I was questioning him.

569
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:41,920
Why did you spill everything?

570
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,510
You fool.

571
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:43,980
You started first.

572
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,450
Are you Xiao Qiushui or not?

573
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:49,110
Come on, get up and talk.

574
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,880
I was a bit rough just now.

575
00:36:58,670 --> 00:36:59,880
I apologize for that.

576
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,320
But

577
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:03,960
you're mistaken.

578
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,670
I'm not Xiao Qiushui.

579
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,070
And we're supposed to believe that?

580
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,190
What proof do you have?

581
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,520
I've got a name of my own.

582
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,030
I'm Xiao Donghuo.

583
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:16,440
Wait.

584
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,510
Xiao Donghuo?

585
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,100
That name...

586
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,950
Sounds familiar, right?

587
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,350
I am indeed very familiar with him.

588
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,680
He's a distant relative of mine.

589
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,070
Only I and that girl you captured

590
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:46,330
know where Xiao Qiushui is hiding.

591
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:49,840
If she wasn't with Xiao Qiushui,

592
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,270
why would she be with you?

593
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:52,590
Truth is,

594
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,530
the two of them had a falling-out.

595
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,320
So she asked me

596
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,590
to help teach Xiao Qiushui a lesson.

597
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:02,190
Which means

598
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:03,960
if you want to find Xiao Qiushui,

599
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,230
you must ask her.

600
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,640
But the word from the martial world

601
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,590
is that Xiao Qiushui is
headed to Guangling

602
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,560
with the Hero Command Token.

603
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,110
We didn't catch Xiao Qiushui

604
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,230
but got Xiao Donghuo?

605
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,800
No. He's playing us.

606
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,790
You…

607
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,360
The Hero Command Token is priceless.

608
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:33,000
If Xiao Qiushui knew

609
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,020
the Power Gang was
pursuing him so relentlessly,

610
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:37,940
he'd have hidden far away by now.

611
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:41,070
You seem wise, sir.

612
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:43,960
Why don't you tell me what you think?

613
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,730
You have a good eye.

614
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,800
I've poisoned that wine. Don't drink it.

615
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,550
But you're right.

616
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,090
That girl's no longer with us.

617
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,070
If you don't start telling the truth,

618
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:04,400
I'll have to beat you up.

619
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:05,640
Hold on. Hold on.

620
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,160
That won't be necessary.

621
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,510
I'll just tell you.

622
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
We've already handed that girl over

623
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,670
to the person who connected us
with the Sword King—

624
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:16,920
Zuo Changsheng,
the Burrow Demon of the Power Gang.

625
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:20,310
He plans to present that girl
to the Sword King.

626
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,920
Tell me the truth.

627
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,590
It is the truth.

628
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,330
If you don't believe me,

629
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:26,880
stab me with that sword.

630
00:39:27,190 --> 00:39:28,390
Don't stab my friend!

631
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,920
Tie, don't play the hero!

632
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,670
Sir, stab me instead.

633
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:33,590
Once you do,

634
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,760
you'll know he's telling the truth.

635
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,630
Let him stab me.

636
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:36,230
Stab me!

637
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,660
My buddy is weak. Don't stab him. Stab me.

638
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,400
Alright, stop arguing.

639
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,030
You've done something stupid.

640
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,730
What do you mean?

641
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:50,510
If the Burrow Demon learns from Tang Fang

642
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,920
about Xiao Qiushui's whereabouts,

643
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,440
he'll definitely bring Xiao Qiushui

644
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,510
to the Sword King.

645
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:55,840
If that happens,

646
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:59,190
won't he steal all your credit?

647
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,800
He's right.

648
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,350
The urgent matter now

649
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,710
is to find the Burrow Demon

650
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:11,670
and then secretly get Tang Fang

651
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,910
back.

652
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:17,400
Qiu, he didn't stab either of us,

653
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:19,420
and he's even giving us advice.

654
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,180
I kind of like this guy.

655
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:23,030
We could be friends with him.

656
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,480
Since we're friends,

657
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:27,110
and that girl is so important to him,

658
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:28,710
we must help him get her back.

659
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,440
Alright.

660
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,960
Hey, Donghuo,

661
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,000
we'll take care of it for you.

662
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,750
We'll take you there.

663
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:53,190
Master.

664
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:55,640
I've received news.

665
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,030
The Sword King's men have taken Tang Fang.

666
00:40:58,030 --> 00:41:00,440
What about Xiao Qiushui? Where is he?

667
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,590
Guangling is
under the Sword King's control.

668
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,110
Our spies have been rooted out by him.

669
00:41:04,110 --> 00:41:06,040
We haven't found Xiao Qiushui yet.

670
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,640
But he'll definitely seek help.

671
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,410
That would naturally mean Qu Hanshan,

672
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,110
He Who Shakes Guangling,

673
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:16,350
one of Guangling's Three Peaks.

674
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,670
I've already sent people

675
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,760
to investigate Tang Fang's situation.

676
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,760
Tang Fang and the Hero Command Token

677
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,480
must not slip through my fingers again.

678
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:26,920
Understood.

679
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,190
You don't allow anyone
to hurt Miss Tang Fang.

680
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,850
That makes her your weakness.

681
00:41:35,110 --> 00:41:36,170
I spoke out of turn.

682
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,370
Go do your work.

683
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:43,190
Yes.
