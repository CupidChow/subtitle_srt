[Episode 35]

3
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,680
Then raise your heads and see clearly

4
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,720
who your true Heavenly King really is.

5
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,190

[Cai Qishen, Flame Lord]

8
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,340
I pledge to follow you, Heavenly King,
to the death.

9
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,000
The Twelve Serial Docks

10
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,590
were originally as close as a family.

11
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:11,320
Heavenly King,
you've looked after our families

12
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,390
and allowed us to enjoy the pinnacle
of the martial world,

13
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,750
gaining both fame and wealth.

14
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,280
This is truly our blessing.

15
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,430
We pledge to follow the Heavenly King
to the death!

16
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,230
We pledge to follow the Heavenly King
to the death!

17
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,079
If this plan succeeds,

18
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,870
your future identity

19
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,020
could be Constable Tieyi,

Xiao Kaiyan,

21
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:50,470
or perhaps

22
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,360
even the Imperial Advisor.

23
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,960
Thank you, Your Majesty.

24
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,070
Wu Jie is determined to
fight against the Northern Wasteland.

25
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:03,100
The pro-war faction in the court

26
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,760
all look to him as their model.

27
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:07,420
I've summoned him back to the capital
many times to defend the state.

28
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,360
What I seek is peace
and an end to the war.

29
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,160
This is all for the sake of
Daxi's state and people.

30
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,660
I believe

31
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:17,730
the people will surely understand
my good intentions.

32
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,720
It's a great blessing
for the people of Daxi

33
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:24,320
to have a sovereign
as benevolent as Your Majesty.

34
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,960
Your Majesty need only continue
sending edicts to the Immortal Pass,

35
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,380
commanding Wu Jie to return to
the capital without delay.

36
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,670
I've already stationed a sizable force

37
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:32,480
in ambush along his route back.

38
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,329
We'll surely capture him.

39
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,329
You mean

40
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,530
if Wu Jie falls into your hands,

41
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,680
the soldiers at the Immortal Pass
will surely

42
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,560
fear the Northern Wasteland Army
breaking through

43
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,540
and won't dare speak out.

44
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,540
Then Wu Jie will appear to be
ignoring imperial orders

45
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:50,440
and openly defying the throne.

46
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:51,680
Am I right?

47
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,540
The determination of our soldiers and
the people to resist

48
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,520
the Northern Wasteland
is Your Majesty's greatest obstacle now.

49
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,470
Using this matter

50
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,410
to discourage the soldiers
and court officials

51
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,540
from their resolve to resist the north

52
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,520
will not only appease
the Northern Wasteland,

53
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,960
but can also ultimately
pave the way for peace.

54
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,420
It'll be killing three birds
with one stone.

55
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,360
Good.

56
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,590
Brilliant.

57
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,339
Excellent.

58
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,440
What a brilliant
three-birds-with-one-stone plan.

59
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,270
At this moment,
I truly wish to honor you as

60
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,420
the Imperial Advisor.

61
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,850
I wouldn't dare, Your Majesty.

62
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:30,920
Alright.

63
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,409
Wu Jie has served with merit.

64
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,210
If one day he truly falls into your hands,

65
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,190
there's no need for punishment.

66
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,560
Just let him return to his hometown
with honor.

67
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,560
Yes.

68
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,430
So what do you think, Senior?

69
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,120
As long as you help our Northern Wasteland

70
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,650
seize the fertile lands
of the Central Plains

71
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,159
and fulfill your promise

72
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,640
to give the three of us
the Voidheart Codex once this is done,

73
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:06,280
we couldn't care less about
who the Heavenly King is.

74
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,630
Everything's falling into place.

75
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,560
You've all earned your share of
the credit,

76
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,360
so of course,

77
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,630
the perks won't be missing.

78
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,310
Qiushui,

79
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,460
I'll make you kneel before me

80
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,350
and admit you were wrong.

81
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:25,430
When all's said and done,
victory will be mine.

82
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:38,610
Show yourself.

83
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,180
Big Brother,

84
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,310
are you awake?

85
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:45,920
Many martial sects have arrived outside,

86
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:49,180
all waiting to discuss matters with you,
Alliance Leader.

87
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,310
He should be awake by now.

88
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,000
Didn't Xueyu say

89
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,580
Big Brother's injuries
were no longer serious?

90
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,409
Yes, she did.

91
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:01,920
Big Brother?

92
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,310
Crazy Yan.

93
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,450
What's this about?

94
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,240
Need to pee?

95
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,430
Hold on. We'll be there soon.

96
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,320
Where exactly are you taking me?

97
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:34,780
Let me go first.

98
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,560
If you have something to say,

99
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,760
we can talk properly.

100
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,060
I've already subdued you.

101
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,159
Do you think I still need to
talk properly with you?

102
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:47,950
When the 16 major sects
besieged me back then,

103
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,350
they didn't talk properly with me, either.

104
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,000
Besides, you're as stubborn as a mule.

105
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,240
Good thing I'm in a hurry.

106
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,920
Isn't this more efficient?

107
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,690
Senior, you've been in seclusion for years
since the Wuxing Mountain battle.

108
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,560
Your return to the martial world this time

109
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,330
must be for some unfinished business.

110
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,790
As long as you're not up to
anything immoral,

111
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,320
I agree to go with you.

112
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,630
As expected, I wasn't wrong about you.

113
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,230
Worthy of being my disciple.

114
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,690
You do have courage.

115
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:32,470
It's not in vain
that I brought you here specially.

116
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:35,909
So, Senior,

117
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,130
where are we going?

118
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,190
Wudang,

119
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,340
just ahead.

120
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,430
I wonder

121
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,310
why you want to go to Wudang, Senior.

122
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:54,480
To persuade Wudang and Shaolin
to merge their martial skills.

123
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:01,160
The Northern Wasteland
is now eyeing us covetously.

124
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,490
Each sect in the Daxi martial world
harbors its own schemes,

125
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,070
and on top of that, some villains
even colluded with the Northern Wasteland,

126
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:10,070
resulting in heavy casualties
among the major sects.

127
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,600
If we want to restore glory

128
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,680
to the martial world within 10 years,

129
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,880
there's only one way:

130
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,800
persuade Wudang and Shaolin

131
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:23,000
to set aside their differences

132
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:27,270
and combine the martial skills
of the two sects together.

133
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,880
Only then can mastery be achieved.

134
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,430
Then, those skills
should be spread widely,

135
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,760
so all righteous warriors can learn them.

136
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:36,950
There will be no more barriers
among sects.

137
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,200
With unity in the martial world,

138
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,659
we can surely stand against
the Northern Wasteland together.

139
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:46,880
Your intentions are truly noble, Senior.

140
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,550
This concerns the fate
of the entire martial world.

141
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:52,410
It's just that Shaolin and Wudang

142
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,150
won't be easily persuaded.

143
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:58,790
At this moment, Shaolin's new abbot
is visiting Wudang.

144
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,900
We must not miss this opportunity.

145
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,970
At the Heroes' Gathering,

146
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,400
you exposed Ji Wupeng's true identity,

147
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,780
[New Leader of Wudang Sect, Dafeng]
[New Abbot of Shaolin Sect, Tianxiang]

148
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,430
rid the martial world of evil,

149
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:26,870
and prevented us from being deceived

150
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,320
by that unforgivable criminal
of the martial world.

151
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,360
We're grateful for that, Senior.

152
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,480
But may I ask what brings you

153
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,390
here today, Senior?

154
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,860
Back then, Tianzheng and Taichan

155
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,930
possessed such courage and majesty.

156
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,320
But since those two,

157
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,600
none of you have shown any real ability
to make a mark.

158
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,410
If you don't unite soon,

159
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:57,370
disaster will surely befall you.

160
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,800
Today, I've come

161
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,710
to deliver a message,

162
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,490
to convey
what Tianzheng and Taichan wished

163
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,030
to you younger generations.

164
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,090
From now on, Wudang's martial skills

165
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,190
must be shared with Shaolin,

166
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:16,790
and Shaolin's martial skills

167
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:18,590
must also be shared with Wudang.

168
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:22,480
Only by doing so
can this great calamity be averted.

169
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:24,200
This...

170
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,550
Shaolin's martial skills
are profound and extensive.

171
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:30,320
I often seek guidance
from Master Tianxiang

172
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,980
on Shaolin's
external martial arts techniques

173
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,510
and have benefited greatly.

174
00:10:34,510 --> 00:10:37,910
However, combining
different martial arts styles together

175
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,320
is a major taboo for martial artists.

176
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:42,910
Shaolin is Shaolin,

177
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,480
and Wudang is Wudang.

178
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:47,630
The two sects can join forces
against enemies,

179
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:49,480
but no matter how friendly we are,

180
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,320
we would never exchange martial skills.

181
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,030
Nonsense!

182
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,080
The true taboo in martial cultivation

183
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:58,580
is working in isolation, refusing to adapt
and narrow-mindedness.

184
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,840
Wudang's martial arts

185
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,150
value internal cultivation,

186
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,570
while Shaolin focuses on
external techniques.

187
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,200
Together, you two sects

188
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,720
can learn from each other

189
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,720
and become each other's greatest aid.

190
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,630
You want Shaolin to learn techniques
from Wudang?

191
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,660
No.

192
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,070
Never!

193
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:17,480
Never?

194
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,250
Then make your move.

195
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,000
Senior Yan.

196
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,770
We're here to mediate,

197
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:27,650
not to fight.

198
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,730
Watch carefully from the side.

199
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,210
This is what
true martial arts fusion looks like.

200
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,700
Watch my move!

201
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,480
Shaolin's ultimate technique,
the Great Hand Seal.

202
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:17,070
This is our Wudang Sect's skill,

203
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:19,150
the Canhe Finger Technique.

204
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,450
How about that?

205
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,350
Wudang plus Shaolin

206
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,840
is much stronger than
either one alone, isn't it?

207
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,720
Amitabha.

208
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,650
There are always greater people
and higher powers beyond.

209
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,130
Senior,

210
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:34,080
I'm enlightened.

211
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,760
I'd also like to request
some guidance from you, Senior.

212
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,780
You're not convinced either?

213
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,760
Come on then.

214
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,250
Draw your sword.

215
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:55,920
I can conserve my energy

216
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,380
and still converse with you effortlessly.

217
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:05,840
Being a hero is about righteousness.

218
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,350
It means even though you know
you shouldn't do something,

219
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,750
you still do it out of righteousness.

220
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,320
Helping the weak

221
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,510
with one's own strength

222
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:11,440
makes one a hero.

223
00:13:11,870 --> 00:13:14,870
And one who inspires
thousands of heroes to uphold justice

224
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,800
deserves to be called a great hero.

225
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,240
Can your Wudang's internal energy

226
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,370
achieve this level?

227
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,240
Only by learning from others' strengths
to make up for your own weaknesses

228
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,040
can you escape the limits of
a narrow perspective.

229
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,610
Which technique did I employ just now

230
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,370
when I struck your acupoint?

231
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,720
It's Wudang's 39 Bridges
with Unified Nod technique.

232
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:00,410
With elements borrowed from
Shaolin's staff techniques.

233
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,860
I admit defeat.

234
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,320
Even if I drew my sword,

235
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:11,440
I would be no match for you, Senior.

236
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,570
Please rise.

237
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,570
Thank you, Senior.

238
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:20,330
Given your current position,

239
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:22,530
you accept defeat gracefully

240
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:24,670
without a single word of complaint.

241
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,910
The Wudang and Shaolin Sects
truly produce exceptional talents.

242
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,870
Given time,

243
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:32,890
you'll surely be on par with
Tianzheng and Taichan.

244
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:35,910
We juniors have yet to train enough.

245
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:39,370
If the leaders of Shaolin
and our sect were still around today,

246
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,930
I believe
they wouldn't disappoint you, Senior.

247
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,810
If those two were still around,

248
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,840
they surely wouldn't be
as stubborn as you are.

249
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:51,040
What exactly are you thinking?

250
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,240
Do you really want others

251
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,870
to master and combine
your two sects' techniques first

252
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,070
before you finally come to your senses?

253
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:01,790
Shaolin and Wudang Sects' martial skills
are profound and extensive.

254
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:02,830
In this world,

255
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,880
besides you, Senior,

256
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,260
who else could possibly master them all?

257
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:10,320
Senior,

258
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,380
aren't you worrying unnecessarily?

259
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,360
It's beyond unnecessary worry.

260
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:17,870
It's complete nonsense.

261
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,630
It's beyond nonsense.

262
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,510
It's completely delusional.

263
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,150
It's beyond delusion.

264
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,030
It's absolute rubbish.

265
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,650
Who would have thought that

266
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,670
the three masters of Wudang Sect,

267
00:15:44,670 --> 00:15:46,480
Jiusheng, Jiusi, and Jiuyi,

268
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,080
actually survived?

269
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,780
And you're even living a leisurely life
here in the mountains.

270
00:15:53,870 --> 00:15:55,320
Not just the three of us.

271
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,890
Shaolin's five monks: Feng, Hua, Xue,
Yue, and Can.

272
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,890
They also survived, didn't they?

273
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,580
It seems quite a few masters
from both sects have survived.

274
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,510
It's just that I wonder
if you three still remember

275
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,030
our battle from years ago.

276
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,990
Of course we still remember.

277
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:13,320
Back then, the three of us

278
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,790
were indeed defeated by you.

279
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:20,310
But when it comes to the martial skills
of Shaolin and Wudang,

280
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,790
you, Mr. Yan, may not necessarily

281
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,600
be a match for the three of us.

282
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,610
Words alone prove nothing.

283
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:28,430
Why not put it to the test?

284
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:31,790
It's been a long time since we've fought.

285
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,080
I'm afraid that in the days to come,

286
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,300
there will be no opponent
worthy of us making a move.

287
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:54,320
Senior Yan!

288
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:15,720
Senior.

289
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,000
You once said

290
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,960
if everyone in the martial world
only strives to be the best

291
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,290
and cannot unite as one,

292
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,480
how will Daxi ever have a future?

293
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:26,829
The martial world of Daxi
will also cease to exist.

294
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,440
Fine.

295
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:29,770
I'll listen to you on this.

296
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,730
After all, I've said
all I came here to say today.

297
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,550
It wasn't in vain that I shared a bond
with Tianzheng and Taichan

298
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,720
all these years.

299
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,480
As the top fighter in the martial world,

300
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,310
you're truly deserving of the title.

301
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:45,240
Even if we only use
Shaolin and Wudang techniques,

302
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,400
we might not be able to win.

303
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,720
You must be Xiao Qiushui.

304
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:56,120
I've heard that Mr. Xiao's martial skills
and character are both exceptional.

305
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,210
You flatter me, Senior.

306
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,240
The Northern Wasteland
has planted spies in Daxi,

307
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,510
who are causing tragedies

308
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,710
and inciting conflicts between sects.

309
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,070
The Fei family's
Thousand-Faces Mask has been exploited,

310
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:10,350
and many sects have been implicated.

311
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:14,920
What Senior Yan said today

312
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,510
is exactly what I've been thinking.

313
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:21,550
I ask that Wudang and Shaolin
join forces against our enemies.

314
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,720
So you also believe that
Wudang can defeat Shaolin,

315
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,570
and Shaolin can defeat Wudang as well?

316
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,160
Only by mastering the strengths
of the two sects,

317
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,550
using diverse fighting techniques

318
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,790
and knowing the enemy's
advantages and flaws,

319
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:35,120
can one hope to prevail.

320
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,310
Mr. Xiao,

321
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,550
you're the unanimously chosen
Alliance Leader at the Heroes' Gathering.

322
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,110
You bear the responsibility of
leading the martial world

323
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,960
in rescuing General Wu.

324
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,510
However,

325
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,000
this is not enough to prove

326
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:48,970
that Shaolin and Wudang
must exchange techniques.

327
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:53,200
Only if you can use
Shaolin and Wudang Sects' techniques

328
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,240
to take three strikes from us

329
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,550
will Wudang consider your suggestion,
Alliance Leader.

330
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,960
Amitabha.

331
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:02,000
Shaolin agrees as well.

332
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,720
Qiushui.

333
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,170
If you truly mean what you say,

334
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,520
then show them

335
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:15,200
that your words are genuine.

336
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,480
Senior Yan.

337
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:24,110
Must the truth

338
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:26,070
be proven this way?

339
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,640
Don't you know

340
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,170
that many truths in this world

341
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,720
are established with fists?

342
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,740
Senior Ya...

343
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,880
Please go easy on me, respected seniors.

344
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,830
Young man,
your martial skills are exceptional.

345
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,230
No need for formalities.

346
00:20:10,030 --> 00:20:11,160
These three moves

347
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,690
seem ordinary on their own,

348
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,220
but together
they form a powerful formation.

349
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,110
Xiao Qiushui,

350
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,180
how will you counter this?

351
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,370
The second move now.

352
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:59,200
Using Wudang's
Nine-Cycle Internal Technique

353
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,110
against Wudang's Celestial Palm,

354
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:03,070
using softness to overcome hardness.

355
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:03,730
Brilliant!

356
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,540
The final move now.

357
00:21:06,510 --> 00:21:08,370
If you can't defeat Xiao Qiushui,

358
00:21:09,070 --> 00:21:10,870
you'll be considered defeated.

359
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:41,710
Five-Finger Heart Connection.
Five petals forming a lotus!

360
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,370
Isn't this just
Shaolin combined with Wudang?

361
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:04,510
I've lost.

362
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,510
I can't figure out
how to counter this move.

363
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,880
You haven't lost.

364
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:14,040
We used
the Five-Finger Heart Connection.

365
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,310
This technique
belongs not to Shaolin alone,

366
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,480
nor to Wudang alone.

367
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:22,840
It's precisely a technique
jointly created by Shaolin and Wudang.

368
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,110
We realized we couldn't defeat you,

369
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,550
so we were forced to use it.

370
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,750
You actually won.

371
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,610
Respected seniors,

372
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:34,790
your insight is truly remarkable.

373
00:22:34,790 --> 00:22:38,350
Young man, you have a noble heart
and care for the world.

374
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,490
Heroes emerge from the young.

375
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:42,600
This saying is true indeed.

376
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,350
In today's martial world,

377
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:46,480
it's you young people who matter most.

378
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,440
We're just a bunch of old bones now.

379
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:51,300
There's indeed no need for us
to continue fighting.

380
00:22:55,070 --> 00:22:57,880
Seniors, you're being too modest.

381
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,610
What have you learned?

382
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,640
I told you

383
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,280
this journey would benefit you.

384
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,110
I've taken the Herbal King's poison

385
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:36,720
and will transfer it to Father
using my internal energy.

386
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,720
I wonder if this poison transfer method

387
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,200
will work.

388
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,480
Father!

389
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:57,830
Father!

390
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,110
Fang.

391
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,070
I'm alright.

392
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,320
Then have some rest, Father.

393
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:38,990
[Heroes of Our Era]

394
00:24:39,110 --> 00:24:42,000
Back then, Tianzheng, Taichan, and Zhichen

395
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,920
established this stele right here

396
00:24:46,270 --> 00:24:48,270
and created the Hero Command Token.

397
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,110
So this is where

398
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,070
you defeated all those heroes

399
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:55,840
and obtained the Hero Command Token,
Senior.

400
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,840
With this journey to Wudang,

401
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,730
my wish has been fulfilled.

402
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,460
After I get one more thing done,

403
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:04,790
I'll return the Hero Command Token to you.

404
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,720
Do you see that thing?

405
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,530
Back when the martial world was in chaos,

406
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,350
I came here specifically

407
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,400
to draw a turtle,

408
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,940
which nearly drove that old man Taichan
to death with anger.

409
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,680
I never thought

410
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,770
you had such a playful spirit, Senior.

411
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,000
Rather than erecting this stele in vain,

412
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,640
it'd be better to show
the so-called heroes of the world

413
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,030
what a bunch of cowards they really are.

414
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:44,960
By the way,

415
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,540
I heard you formed something called
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

416
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,720
I hope that in the martial world,

417
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,030
someone like you will make a difference.

418
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,270
Perhaps your name

419
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,100
will one day be carved on this stele,

420
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,630
as a true hero.

421
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,640
What I do

422
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,720
is not to make a name for myself

423
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,230
in the martial world.

424
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,010
Just like you did in your time, Senior.

425
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,640
Good lad.

426
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,880
I like that.

427
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:20,880
The journey in this martial world

428
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,550
is not only about
flamboyant spree and jubilation.

429
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:25,550
You should live up to justice,

430
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,550
look down without shame to earth,

431
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,200
move in line with righteousness,

432
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,730
and stay true to your heart.

433
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,430
If I can achieve that,

434
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,710
then my journey in this world
will not be in vain.

435
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:38,510
Well said.

436
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,310
I can say my life hasn't been wasted.

437
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:48,150
Thank you for your help, Senior.

438
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:53,710
Now, two streams of internal energy
are colliding within me.

439
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,550
Shaolin and Wudang's martial arts styles

440
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:58,240
embody opposing principles—
one is hard, the other gentle.

441
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,750
Did you bring me here today

442
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:02,830
to give me some kind of hint, Senior?

443
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,520
You're smart.

444
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:08,150
Now that you've realized it,

445
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,440

Father.

479
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:20,960
Father!

480
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,660
Tang Song.

481
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,440
Shouldn't you be...

482
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,420
Fang.

483
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:49,000
I heard you worked really hard
to treat your father,

484
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,780
so I came specially to check on him.

485
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,910
Why are you so cold?

486
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,940
What do you want to do to my father?

487
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,580
Let him go!

488
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:58,660
Fang, don't get worked up.

489
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,840
The poison is already clouding your mind.

490
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,160
If your anger flares again,

491
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:04,090
I fear you may spiral into madness.

492
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,550
Fang.

493
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:10,030
Don't worry about me!

494
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,640

495
00:30:12,390 --> 00:30:13,790
How dare you hurt Master?

496
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,850
Aren't you worried
Old Madam Tang will punish you?

497
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:18,680
You don't actually think

498
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,010
I'm afraid of that dying old woman,
do you?

499
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,520
Rest assured.

500
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:26,110

00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,000

542
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,440
I'll kill you!

543
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:52,090
Fang.

544
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:54,790
Fang.

545
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:57,600
I'm here.

546
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,280
Be good, Fang.

547
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,940
From today on,

548
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,680
you must listen to your cousin.

549
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,310
Understand?

550
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,400
Now, kill him for me.

551
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,310
How dare you!

552
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:37,720
I'm still alive.

553
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,260
What are you trying to do, you scoundrel?

554
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:50,960
I'll eliminate you menace today!

555
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,590
You...

556
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,440
What trickery is this?

557
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,830
Old hag.

558
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:11,030
I already poisoned you with
the Bone-Softening Incense.

559
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:15,670
The poison activates as soon as
you use your martial skills.

560
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,650
You wretched creature!

561
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,590
How dare you betray your master
and defy your lineage!

562
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,590
Elder Chijie.

563
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,070
Yes.

564
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,710
Seize him for me!

565
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,360
Yes!

566
00:34:38,290 --> 00:34:39,290
You old fossil.

567
00:34:40,610 --> 00:34:43,070
You've controlled
the Tang Sect for decades.

568
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,730
Stuck in your old ways all day.

569
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,370
Since you lack the ability to lead,

570
00:34:47,389 --> 00:34:50,250
you might as well hand over
the Tang Sect Token to me.

571
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,560
I'll make the Tang Sect prosper.

572
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,680
Get the Tang Sect Token now.

573
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,190
Mere Bone-Softening Incense.

574
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,600
Don't think you can take me down
just like that.

575
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,630
No way.

576
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,090
How can this be?

577
00:35:41,270 --> 00:35:42,150
Seize her now!

578
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,530
Don't worry.

579
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,670
Where am I?

580
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,190
Mr. Yan, please don't move.

581
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,230
You suddenly collapsed at Wudang Square.

582
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:06,130
I guess your old illness flared up,

583
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:08,030
so I brought you back for treatment.

584
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,630
How are you feeling now?

585
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:12,230
Who is she?

586
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,030
This is my older sister, Xiao Xueyu.

587
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:20,370
Xueyu.

588
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,160
How's Senior Yan's condition now?

589
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,800
A nail was thrust into
the back of Mr. Yan's neck,

590
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,800
driven with profound internal energy,

591
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,200
reaching his meridians.

592
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,960
Normally he only feels pain,

593
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,900
but now it has affected
multiple meridians.

594
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:36,800
Ordinary treatment can only address
the symptoms, not the root of the problem.

595
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,200
Only by removing the nail

596
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:40,810
can we completely eliminate the danger.

597
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:46,600
This is all the doing of
that venomous scoundrel from Tang Sect.

598
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:48,800
Senior.

599
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,170
I've roamed the martial world,

600
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,030
unrivaled under heaven,

601
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,230
and few could ever harm me.

602
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:03,760
Yet in that battle at Wuxing Mountain,

603
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,500
Tang Yaoshun ambushed me
with the Soul-Piercing Nail.

604
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:11,230
His skills are formidable.

605
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,550
Senior,

606
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,640
I'm willing to help you remove this nail.

607
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:21,490
I've already given you

608
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:23,760
the Agarwood Energy-Harmonizing Pill.

609
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,490
The medicine has taken effect.

610
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,760
Your vital energy should be balanced now.

611
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:28,360
Senior,

612
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,730
you might as well give it a try.

613
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,230
Senior.

614
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,330
Qiushui.

615
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,960
Then I'll trouble you with this.

616
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,550
Alright.

617
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,520
Senior, pardon me.

618
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,120
It's fine. Continue.

619
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,690
Pardon me, Senior.

620
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,630
Senior.

621
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:51,630
This Soul-Piercing Nail actually fused
our internal energies together,

622
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,560
and the nail only goes deeper
when I try to pull it out.

623
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,030
Let it be.

624
00:39:59,150 --> 00:40:01,150
This nail has been with me for years.

625
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,360
It has already grown into my marrow.

626
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:04,290
If we leave it in,

627
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,580
I'll just feel dizzy and weak.

628
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,250
Some rest will take care of it.

629
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,040
If we really try to remove it,

630
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,710
it might cost me my life.

631
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,520
Senior, don't worry.

632
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,920
I'm sure I can find a solution.

633
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,480
Whatever you do,
don't go to the Tang Sect.

634
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,610
I'd rather die than accept their help.

635
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,400
Qiushui,

636
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,860
let's step outside

637
00:40:23,070 --> 00:40:24,530
so that Senior could rest.

638
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:27,800
Okay.

639
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,550
Tang Fang.

640
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,000
Pour me some tea.

641
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,880
This puppet-control needle

642
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:43,760
works so well.

643
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,110
Tang Fang.

644
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,660
Those precious hidden weapons
and poisons of yours

645
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:02,480
and all those things
Old Madam Tang gave you

646
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
are of no use to you now.

647
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,220
Why don't you hand them over to me?

648
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:16,710
You've always had all the good stuff
since childhood.

649
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,490
Didn't expect this,

650
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,710
did you?

651
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,110
Stop fooling around.
