who colluded with the Power Gang

take good care of yourself

373

and keep well.

If anything happens...

375
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,160
Now that I'm joining another family,

376
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,490
I'd hate to trouble the Xiao family again.

377
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,910
Don't worry, Yiren.

378
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,480
Who are you?

379
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,610
What are you doing?

380
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:22,160
Who am I?

381
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:24,340
I'm your husband.

382
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,240
I'm here to consummate our marriage,
of course.

383
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,480
Come on, a drink for our union.

384
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,440
Get away from me!

385
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,540
The one I'm supposed to marry

386
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,270
has always been Nangong Wushang.

387
00:27:35,270 --> 00:27:36,590
Who do you think you are?

388
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,850
Don't you mess with me!

389
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,440
Xiao Xueyu, listen up.

390
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:42,390
I knew you wouldn't be submissive,

391
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,470
so, earlier,
I lit incense to knock you out.

392
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,860
Since you brother Xiao Yiren

393
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,380
first came to discuss this marriage

394
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:49,100
and signed an agreement with us,

395
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,540
it has always been me, Nangong Han,

396
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,350
who would marry you.

397
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,310
[Marriage Agreement]

398
00:27:53,850 --> 00:27:55,450
Yiren wouldn't do this to me.

399
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,910
He must've been deceived by you.

400
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,810
Though the Xiao family has fallen,

401
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,700
it still has been friends

402
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:05,780
with the Nangong family for generations.

403
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,650
How could you ambush us like that?

404
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,780
Xueyu,

405
00:28:09,070 --> 00:28:10,870
come on, take a good look at this.

406
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:13,330
Isn't it
Xiao Yiren's handwriting and seal?

407
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,470
He wrote this with his own hand.

408
00:28:15,470 --> 00:28:17,200
You do recognize it, don't you?

409
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,610
Try to come around to it.

410
00:28:20,810 --> 00:28:21,470
Stop acting

411
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,270
like a paragon of chastity here.

412
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,680
Think about the current condition

413
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,070
the Xiao family is in.

414
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:30,510
Your brother Xiao Yiren
doesn't even have the master's sword.

415
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,940
It is actually an honor

416
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,200
for you to marry me.

417
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:35,930
I'd rather die

418
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:38,510
than be your bride.

419
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:39,830
Really?

420
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,760
I'd like to see how this goes.

421
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,720
Xueyu, let's leave.

422
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:04,160
Nobody can force you to do anything.

423
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,590
Remember this:

424
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:10,830
I, Xiao Xueyu,
have nothing to do with you whatsoever.

425
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,080
Changge Sword?

426
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,500
From today on,

427
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,750
if the Nangong family
dares to offend the Xiaos again,

428
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,850
I'll show you no mercy
with Changge Sword in my hands.

429
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,310
Let's go.

430
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,550
Xiao Qiushui!

431
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,110
[Liang Residence]

432
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,130
Xueyu, don't worry.

433
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,310
You're safe here.

434
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,480
The Nangong family
wouldn't dare to mess with this place.

435
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,400
As for Yiren,

436
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,640
I'll try to talk some sense into him.

437
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,920
I did agree to this marriage.

438
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,660
I should repay Father and Mother
for raising me.

439
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,720
I'd also like to contribute
as much as I can

440
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,580
to revitalizing the Xiao family.

441
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,560
It just didn't occur to me

442
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,330
that Yiren would choose

443
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,990
not to trust me in the end,

444
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:48,080
despite our years' bond
as brother and sister.

445
00:30:49,270 --> 00:30:51,400
This whole thing was absurd in nature.

446
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:52,640
Xueyu,

447
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:57,090
you shouldn't have
forsaken your lifelong happiness,

448
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,070
or put yourself in peril.

449
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,440
Yiren's choice was even more ridiculous.

450
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,020
How could he trade
a family member's well-being

451
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,950
for the family's dignity and pride

452
00:31:06,110 --> 00:31:09,510
that Father and Mother
devoted their lives to safeguarding?

453
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,130
On my way to the Nangong Residence,

454
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,450
memories came flooding back.

455
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:24,430
I recalled the first time

456
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:27,550
that Father and Mother brought me home.

457
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,400
The first thing you said

458
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:33,000
already drove my worries away,

459
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:37,000
and made me start thinking of myself
as part of the Xiao family.

460
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:37,590
Qiushui,

461
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:42,080
the family time we spent together
back then

462
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,160
was truly wonderful.

463
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,000
Xueyu,

464
00:31:51,110 --> 00:31:52,270
family members

465
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,680
should never be bound
by the moral shackles

466
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,160
of fulling filial duties.

467
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,110
We should respect and understand
each other instead.

468
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:02,510
Nobody in this world can,

469
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,960
or has the right

470
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:07,750
to make you do what you are reluctant to.

471
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:12,170
And you, among all people,
should never think of self-sacrifice.

472
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,140
You must cherish yourself

473
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:17,000
and pursue what you truly want.

474
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,400
Only that is the wish

475
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,360
of all the family members

476
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,050
who genuinely love you and care about you.

477
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,200
I got it.

478
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:27,970
Don't worry.

479
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,270
Now that

480
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:32,050
I've rescued you
from the Nangong family,

481
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,200
I'll make sure
nobody ever hurts your feelings

482
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,000
or forces you to do anything
against your will.

483
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,350
If such a person does appear,

484
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,510
I'll smash his head and break his legs.

485
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,680
Qiushui,

486
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:49,240
thank you.

487
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:51,960
We're family.

488
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,270
Save that sort of parlance for strangers.

489
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,310
Xueyu,

490
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,480
the Qu sisters reside here.

491
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,480
You should talk with them

492
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,350
and recuperate.

493
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:11,030
I guess they're making soup for you now.

494
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,640
I'll go see them.

495
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,160
Qiushui.

496
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,640
I'm not only

497
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,210
thanking you for today's help,

498
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:22,960
but also

499
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,440
for saving my life when I fell off a cliff
during a trip

500
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,640
of collecting herbs.

501
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
It was you who kept bringing back
precious herbs for me.

502
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,930
I'm truly grateful to you for that.

503
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,240
We are family.

504
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,680
No matter what danger
you may face in the future,

505
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,180
I'll always be the first one
to come help you.

506
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:44,590
Alright.

507
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,480
Let's leave it there.

508
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,680
Or you may hate me for being a nag.

509
00:33:49,510 --> 00:33:50,310
In my opinion,

510
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,120
our eyes should always be
on the road ahead.

511
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,000
We should stick together
as siblings forever.

512
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,400
I was always the one
nagging at you in the past.

513
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,960
Today, it is you
who is trying to enlighten me.

514
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,270
Alright.

515
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,000
Xueyu, I see you've lost a lot of weight.

516
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,400
Let me go get soup for you.

517
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:55,800
Tang Fang.

518
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,510
Seeing how busy you were,

519
00:35:02,670 --> 00:35:04,530
I decided to wait for you outside.

520
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:14,470
You're going somewhere?

521
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,840
All women have similar struggles.

522
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:32,970
You saved Xueyu from doom.

523
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,480
I'm happy about that.

524
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,480
When Xueyu was trapped
in the Nangong Residence,

525
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:44,550
her situation was identical to mine

526
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:45,670
back in Tang Sect.

527
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,750
So, I'm glad that you went to her rescue.

528
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:54,710
That's why she's safe and sound now.

529
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:01,920
Thank you.

530
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,730
I received a letter from my father,

531
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:15,440
saying that they are in trouble

532
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,700
and expecting my help.

533
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,280
Since your wounds have healed,

534
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,320
I think it's time I went home.

535
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,460
Are the problems serious?

536
00:36:29,230 --> 00:36:30,690
No, just trivial matters.

537
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,070
Once I solve them,

538
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:33,800
I'll come back here.

539
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:42,710
Okay.

540
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,830
Then we'll all go to Emei Sect together.

541
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,030
If we can figure out

542
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,920
the secrets of the Voidheart Codex,

543
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,400
there will be a cure for your father.

544
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,650
Big Brother!

545
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:39,750
Just as you expected,

546
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,620
Nangong Wushang and his brothers

547
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:43,620
are making a scene in the Xiao Villa.

548
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,960
The Xiao family is obviously disrespectful

549
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,220
to the Nangong family.

550
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:49,280
Mr. Nangong,

551
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,130
what are you doing?

552
00:37:51,510 --> 00:37:52,570
Stop playing dumb!

553
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,630
Xiao Yiren,

554
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,030
our family treated you
with absolute decency.

555
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,150
We arranged the betrothal gifts
and the wedding as you asked.

556
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,230
Before the reception was over,

557
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:03,390
my brother's bride
was taken away by Xiao Qiushui.

558
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,080
Did you mean to humiliate us?

559
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,760
Wasn't Xueyu supposed to
marry you, Nangong Wushang?

560
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,480
What exactly happened?

561
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,150
Xiao Qiushui wasn't able to do
what you said.

562
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,810
Besides,
he's no longer part of the Xiao family.

563
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,710
He's not?

564
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:20,060
Xiao Qiushui was holding Changge Sword,

565
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:22,660
which belongs to
the master of the Xiao family.

566
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,760
What?

567
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,300
Qiushui has Changge Sword?

568
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,280
Yiren,

569
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,340
what is that about?

570
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,150
Xiao Yiren, since you can't
make decisions,

571
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,800
why pretend to be the head of the family?

572
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,610
I'd like to cancel this marriage now.

573
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:37,830
As long as the Xiao family
returns all the betrothal gifts

574
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:41,160
and compensates us for our losses
that amount to 5,000 taels,

575
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:42,760
we'll call it even.

576
00:38:42,950 --> 00:38:43,910
Nangongs,

577
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:45,870
how shameless of you.

578
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,000
How are we supposed to
get you 5,000 taels?

579
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,800
If necessary,
we'll even pull down your villa

580
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,580
and take the pieces away!

581
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,310
How dare you!

582
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,270
Your aggression is not to be tolerated!

583
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,000
Fight those who resist,

584
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:57,920
with no regard for casualties!

585
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:11,030
Qiushui?

586
00:39:14,710 --> 00:39:15,670
Xiao Qiushui?

587
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:18,340
For taking advantage of the vulnerable,

588
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,870
the Nangong family
doesn't deserve respect.

589
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,280
How dare you mess with us
in our own place?

590
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,610
Now I announce, the marriage is canceled.

591
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:29,610
The betrothal gifts will be returned
to you tomorrow morning.

592
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:31,590
Let's go!

593
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,480
Qiushui.

594
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,510
You've got your martial strength back?

595
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,570
Look how impressive your skills are.

596
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:50,310
You're a better fighter now.

597
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:51,960
A worse troublemaker, too!

598
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,360
If you're talking about

599
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,400
me taking Xueyu away
from the Nangong Residence,

600
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,840
then I did nothing wrong.

601
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:07,800
Yiren,

602
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:10,310
you're the one who did wrong.

603
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,120
Let me ask you.

604
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,710
Do you really have Changge Sword?

605
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,510
When I got hold of it,

606
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,230
I meant to bring it back to you.

607
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,630
But now, as I see it,
it's completely unnecessary.

608
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,010
Every member of the Xiao family

609
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:34,360
has the duty to revitalize the clan.

610
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,360
But I disagree

611
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,110
with your approach, Yiren.

612
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:45,630
Xiao Qiushui!

613
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,960
Qiushui!

614
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,440
Qiushui...

615
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,590
It really hurts.

616
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,000
How are you?

617
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:35,360
I'm in pain.

618
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,800
You reckless fool

619
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,320
with terrible lightness skills.

620
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,230
How silly.

621
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:41,480
Next time, I...

622
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,390
Qiushui, look!

623
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,110
I found this falconry whistle

624
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,360
in a hidden compartment
in the Sword King's bedroom.
