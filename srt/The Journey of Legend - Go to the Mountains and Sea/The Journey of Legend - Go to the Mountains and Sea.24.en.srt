1
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,640
That day, Old Madam Wu gave me a dagger.

2
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:51,229
She said it was a gift from Mr. Zhang.

3
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:52,710
But I accidentally discovered

4
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:54,509
this crystal inside the dagger.

5
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,039
This crystal is the Hero Command Token.

6
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,000
But I've been unable

7
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,440
to figure out
the mystery of the Voidheart Codex.

8
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,940
We've finally found
the Hero Command Token,

9
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,009
but it turns out the token actually
doesn't contain the Voidheart Codex.

10
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:14,910
These 3 fingerprints

11
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:17,750
belong to Tianzheng from Shaolin Sect,

12
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,710
Taichan from Wudang Sect,

13
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,240
and Zhichen from Emei Sect.

14
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,590
The only one still alive

15
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,740
is Zhichen from Emei Sect.

16
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,870
If we go to Emei Sect,

17
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,870
even if we don't find

18
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,930
the Voidheart Codex's whereabouts,

19
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:34,190
we might find clues about Crazy Yan.

20
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:39,840
I've always felt that Crazy Yan

21
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,730
might be able to cure your father.

22
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:44,870
Besides,

23
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,050
I once promised Old Madam Wu

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,620
that I would find Crazy Yan's sister.

25
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,800
What's wrong?

26
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:10,490
It's Tang Song.

27
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:12,990
When I fell into the trap,

28
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,960
I sent a bee to follow him.

29
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:18,050
He's heading to Insect Valley now.

30
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,750
Is there something unusual about that?

31
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:23,360
The once-every-five-years Night of Yin-Hai

32
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,430
is about to begin.

33
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:26,270
It's exactly at this time

34
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,010
that other branch families
can challenge the first branch—

35
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,110
regardless of life or death.

36
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,910
The winner will become
the new leader of Tang Sect.

37
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,250
But this time, the place
chosen for the Night of Yin-Hai

38
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,370
is actually Insect Valley.

39
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,750
That's what I find suspicious.

40
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,950
That is the forbidden area of Tang Sect.

41
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,060
It's been a few years since it opened.

42
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,850
The Death Beetle King.

43
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:53,079
The rejuvenation place for it
is Insect Valley.

44
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:57,430
So he wants to use the Night of Yin-Hai
to open Insect Valley.

45
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,440
Big Brother,

46
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:04,400
I heard you're going to see Sword King.

47
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,130
Big Brother,

48
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:07,280
we still haven't found that whatever king.

49
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,150
The Failure King.

50
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,960
-Right, the Failure King.
-Although we haven't found it,

51
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,630
I will get

52
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,360
some evidence from Sword King.

53
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,190
What do you need us to do?

54
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:15,960
Don't worry.

55
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,990
I'll get Sword King
to leak some information to me.

56
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:22,130
You, under the pretext
of suppressing Liu Suifeng,

57
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,200
will actually weaken
the Power Gang's strongholds.

58
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,080
Count us sisters in.

59
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,270
The Power Gang harmed our father.
They're the Qu family's sworn enemies.

60
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,510
Now we are

61
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:33,040
also members
of the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood.

62
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,920
Big Brother,
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood

63
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,850
is growing stronger and stronger.

64
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,200
That's because of all of you.

65
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,190
In the future,
the Shenzhou Sworn Brotherhood

66
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:44,450
must restore peace to the martial world.

67
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,630
But everyone must remain vigilant.

68
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,560
So we must strengthen our martial skills.

69
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,390
-Okay.
-Okay.

70
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,980
Guys, please open Insect Valley's gate.

71
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,000
Tonight is the Night of Yin-Hai.

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,330
We'll guard this place.

73
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,190
Insect Valley has always been
under my supervision.

74
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,680
Why the change of personnel?

75
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,810
You should ask the 5 elders about that.

76
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,180
Greetings, Elder Chijie.

77
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,680
Greetings to the 4 elders
of Success, Failure, Gain, Loss.

78
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,140
This time's Night of Yin-Hai
will take place in Insect Valley.

79
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,000
We will replace
all the guards of Insect Valley

80
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,800
with convicts sentenced to penal servitude
in the Avici Tower.

81
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,260
This ensures impartiality and fairness
toward all branches.

82
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,230
Open the gate.

83
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,750
Take your men and leave.

84
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:53,800
Yes.

85
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,120
Thank you, elders.

86
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,780
Please go and rest.

87
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:22,800
Master.

88
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:24,750
The guards here

89
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,830
have all been replaced with our men.

90
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,510
Now you can
go to the back valley without worry

91
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:29,630
to attend to your matters.

92
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:30,120
No rush.

93
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,860
Is there something still troubling you?

94
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,310
If I were Xiao Qiushui,

95
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:39,050
I would definitely
come to Insect Valley today.

96
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,640
Guard this place carefully.

97
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:43,800
Yes.

98
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,600
Mr. Xiao,
have you found the Death Beetle King?

99
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,160
No.

100
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,220
Why come to me
without bringing what I asked for?

101
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,530
I'm here...

102
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,920
to save you.

103
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,160
The molted shell of the Death Beetle King?

104
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,320
Its 8 patterns are about to reduce to 7.

105
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,360
Correct.

106
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,470
Now,

107
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,870
the Power Gang
uses Death Beetles in the Misery Pills

108
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,929
to control others.

109
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,700
This Death Beetle King

110
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:40,770
is about to molt

111
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,409
and urgently needs to rejuvenate.

112
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,120
What does this have to do with me?

113
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,640
Such an important thing—

114
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,630
Chief Li didn't entrust it to you.

115
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,750
Instead, he gave this most trusted object

116
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,360
to someone else.

117
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,550
Think about it.

118
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,270
If Liu Suifeng really succeeds
in rejuvenating the Death Beetle King,

119
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,270
he will become the new Blood Master.

120
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,360
The Misery Pills control so many people,

121
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,010
including you, Sword King, right?

122
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,800
You know everything?

123
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,070
Above the Eight Kings of the Power Gang,

124
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,750
all are controlled by the Misery Pills.

125
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,790
The purpose

126
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,140
is to prevent everyone
from killing each other.

127
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,720
If someone
truly becomes the new Blood Master

128
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,060
and breaks free
from the control of the Misery Pill,

129
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:38,870
guess

130
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:41,390
what would happen to those

131
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,540
he bears a grudge against.

132
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,200
What do you intend to do?

133
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,840
If Liu Suifeng

134
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:01,200
accidentally kills one of the Eight Kings,

135
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,870
the Misery Pill inside him
will be activated.

136
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,600
Then he'll be severely weakened.

137
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,550
At that time,

138
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,030
both you and I can kill him.

139
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,620
Since we are to work together,

140
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:22,630
you must tell me

141
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,290
where his forces are located,

142
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,960
so I can arrange

143
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,270
to have them destroyed.

144
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,630
Then,

145
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,200
you and I...

146
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,240
Nice tea.

147
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,270
The entrance is right here.

148
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:56,720
Okay.

149
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,080
Wait.

150
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,450
Who authorized you
to guard the forbidden area?

151
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:11,070
It was the elders' decision, of course.

152
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,330
On the Night of Yin-Hai,

153
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,700
the current Master hasn't even shown up.

154
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,080
There's no need

155
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,670
for my father to deal with you personally.

156
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:24,730
Let us through now!

157
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,760
Who gave you the nerve
to act so recklessly?

158
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,240
If you're not convinced,

159
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,150
why don't we have a match right now?

160
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,450
Bring it on.

161
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,030
Old Madam Tang has arrived!

162
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,520
-Greetings, Old Madam Tang.
-Greetings, Old Madam Tang.

163
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,010
Coming this far
is already annoying enough.

164
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,720
Success, Failure, Gain, Loss, and Chijie,

165
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,840
The location for this Night of Yin-Hai—

166
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,270
was it your idea?

167
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,380
-Yes.
-Yes.

168
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,870
Never mind. Then let it begin quickly.

169
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,550
What's going on?

170
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,610
Set the sedan down.

171
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,080
What's going on?

172
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:22,240
A stone came out of nowhere

173
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,320
and injured my foot.

174
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,320
I startled Old Madam Tang.

175
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,000
Please forgive me!

176
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,330
Enough. Have someone else take his place.

177
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:27,910
Yes.

178
00:13:32,030 --> 00:13:32,510
You.

179
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:34,980
Take his place.

180
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,000
Lift the sedan!

181
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:57,630
Set it down!

182
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,360
The night is deep and the dew is heavy.

183
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:16,030
This Night of Yin-Hai

184
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,950
will likely be a long one.

185
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,400
-Greetings, Old Madam Tang.
-Greetings, Old Madam Tang.

186
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:41,730
Xiao Qiushui has entered.

187
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,950
Don't let anyone enter the back valley.

188
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:48,910
-Yes.
-Yes.

189
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,150
Tang Song

190
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,580
played so many tricks.

191
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,550
I suspect
there's a greater plot behind him.

192
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:26,670
You'll go to the Scorpion Platform.

193
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,960
Be careful with everything.

194
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,910
The Night of Yin-Hai
comes once every 5 years.

195
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:34,970
After all these years, I'm used to it.

196
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,520
If I can't even handle such a situation,

197
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,120
how can I call myself
a member of the first branch?

198
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,870
Find a way to get to the back valley.

199
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:43,000
Leave the rest to me.

200
00:15:59,000 --> 00:15:59,670
Tang Song,

201
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,040
it seems
the other branches won't be coming up.

202
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,240
It'll just be our first branch
against your third branch.

203
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,570
Let's have a good fight.

204
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,360
Tang Qing,

205
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:14,720
aren't those two
experts from the third branch?

206
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:18,370
Why aren't they coming up
to the Scorpion Platform?

207
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,030
Tang Song,

208
00:16:26,390 --> 00:16:29,150
you guys still won't come up
to the Scorpion Platform.

209
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,480
What tricks are you trying to play
in front of Old Madam Tang?

210
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,750
Stop wasting time.

211
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,270
Tang Qing, you go first.

212
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,070
Let's finish early
so we can go back to rest.

213
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,080
Yes.

214
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:49,480
Fang, you're really eager to fight me.

215
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:50,750
Aren't you eager?

216
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,180
Make your move.

217
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,440
Deputy Chief Liu.

218
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:13,270
This is the perfect place
to nurture the Death Beetle King.

219
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,200
The miasma is thick,
and fungi and grass grow abundantly.

220
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,270
Excellent.

221
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:21,670
The moonlight has appeared.

222
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
I shall begin now.

223
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,170
Guard the Beetle King well.

224
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,440
I'll eliminate any potential threats!

225
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,250
Ghost King.

226
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,310
Qu Hanshan, you...

227
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,490
That's Chief's treasure.

228
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:29,550
Does Liu Suifeng want
to keep it all for himself?

229
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,480
Qu Hanshan, this is Chief's order!

230
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,640
What if Liu Suifeng lied?

231
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:36,440
I think you'd better hand it over to me.

232
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,720
I'll go ask Chief.

233
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:41,470
If you interrupt its feeding,
all our efforts will be wasted!

234
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,910
If you won't hand it over,

235
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,620
I'll have to borrow your body.

236
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,270
Xiao Qiushui,

237
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,680
you think your 60 years of internal energy

238
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,920
is enough to ambush me?

239
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,920
As expected, we both came prepared.

240
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,720
The disguise
on our way into the valley just now

241
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,680
was merely a show.

242
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,280
Hiding from me

243
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,070
isn't your style.

244
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:30,230
Why don't you come out

245
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,400
so we can talk properly?

246
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,640
Don't you want to know

247
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:37,630
where your parents' bodies are?

248
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,250
I've treated them quite well.

249
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:42,550
To preserve their bodies from decay,

250
00:19:42,550 --> 00:19:44,210
I've put in quite some effort.

251
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,200
But rest assured.

252
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,150
They're frozen quite solid.

253
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:51,570
Even striking them with a sword sheath
couldn't bend them.

254
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,960
Though the sound was rather grating.

255
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:08,830
Ghost King?

256
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:26,840
Tang Song,

257
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,110
you can't defeat me.

258
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,310
Qu Hanshan,

259
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,200
it's you.

260
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,900
You're clever indeed.
You guessed it in one try.

261
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:54,480
I captured Ghost King, disguised him,
and placed him here,

262
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,410
so you could kill the wrong person.

263
00:20:56,830 --> 00:21:00,030
You... actually worked with Xiao Qiushui.

264
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,350
Why not?

265
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:03,030
By killing you,

266
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:04,790
I can monopolize the gang's authority,

267
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,480
inherit the Death Beetle King,

268
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,310
and control the entire martial world.

269
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:11,000
This partnership suits me just fine.

270
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:06,830
Song,

271
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:10,200
this Death Bringer is forbidden
in Tang Sect's internal conflicts.

272
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,130
You can't use it.

273
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,350
Look!

274
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:25,870
This is...

275
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,000
Since the Night of Yin-Hai has begun,
it must proceed.

276
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,310
Tang Fang has won 4 matches in a row.

277
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,480
One more victory,
and she'll remain the first branch.

278
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,000
Qu Hanshan,

279
00:22:47,550 --> 00:22:49,150
you've been deceived by him!

280
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:35,960
Tang Song,

281
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:37,310
you've lost.

282
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,740
Old Madam Tang,

283
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,750
Tang Song used evil techniques
to coerce the fifth branch.

284
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:42,830
Please be clear!

285
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:53,550
-Punish Tang Song severely!
-Punish Tang Song severely!

286
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,110
He must be punished severely!

287
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:57,970
Old Madam Tang,
Tang Song used gu insects to force us

288
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:00,070
to make Insect Valley
the location for the Night of Yin-Hai.

289
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,510
Then, using the 5 elders' authority
over the Avici Tower,

290
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,640
he replaced the guards here

291
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,350
with masked convicts.

292
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,440
Come here.

293
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,270
I'm Xiao Qiushui from Huanhua.

294
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,800
Greetings, Old Madam Tang.

295
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:28,830
So you're Xiao Qiushui.

296
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,270
But any outsider who disrupts
Tang Sect's arena fight

297
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:33,680
must pay with his life.

298
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,960
Old Madam Tang, please be clear.

299
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,720
When Tang Song used the forbidden weapon,

300
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,160
the duel had already ended.

301
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,480
Xiao Qiushui stepped in
to aid me at that moment,

302
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:46,160
so no rules were broken.

303
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,640
Then how did he enter Insect Valley?

304
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,400
Fang, surely you weren't unaware, right?

305
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,260
Old Madam Tang,

306
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,330
entering Tang Sect's forbidden area
is indeed my fault.

307
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,460
But Tang Sect's Tang Song
conspired with the Power Gang

308
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,830
to use Insect Valley
to rejuvenate the gu insect.

309
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:08,110
I only came to stop it.

310
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,220
Now the Beetle King has been killed by me,

311
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:14,210
and all infected Tang Sect members
have recovered.

312
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,160
I came to help Tang Sect

313
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:18,950
eliminate the traitors.

314
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,510
Tang Song!

315
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:31,830
Is that so?

316
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:36,230
Since we're not dead, we're the witnesses.

317
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,350
You'd better confess everything.

318
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,350
I was foolish,

319
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,240
manipulated by the Power Gang.

320
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,640
Old Madam Tang, spare me!
Old Madam Tang, spare me!

321
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,040
Old Madam Tang, spare me!

322
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,440
Rare to see such a ruthless junior.

323
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,030
What a pity.

324
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,240
Send Tang Song
and all members of the third branch

325
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,510
to the Avici Tower!

326
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,830
Old Madam Tang, spare me! No!

327
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,560
-Old Madam Tang, spare me!
-No!

328
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,310
-Let me go!
-Old Madam Tang, spare me!

329
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:04,160
Old Madam Tang! Old Madam Tang, spare me!

330
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,440
-Old Madam Tang, please have mercy!
-Old Madam Tang!

331
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:08,960
Old Madam Tang, I knew nothing about this.

332
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,730
I was deceived by Tang Song.

333
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:13,400
Please believe me. Please believe me!

334
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,920
Please believe me! Please believe me!

335
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:38,440
The Avici Tower is harsh,

336
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
but you don't have to kill yourself.

337
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,000
I'm innocent.

338
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,060
I'd rather die to prove my innocence.

339
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,510
If the third branch is completely gone,
things will be less lively.

340
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:55,830
Send her to my courtyard to do chores.

341
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,640
Thank you, Old Madam Tang. Thank you!

342
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,450
The third son from Huanhua,

343
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,030
Xiao Qiushui, right?

344
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:19,790
Yes.

345
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,440
You came to my place and caused chaos.

346
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,110
If I just let this go,

347
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,790
wouldn't Tang Sect

348
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,270
lose a great deal of face?

349
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:30,610
Old Madam Tang,

350
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:31,480
-he...
-Fang.

351
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,510
Bringing an outsider into Tang Sect
without permission is a grave offense too.

352
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:36,110
Guards,

353
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,420
send Tang Fang to the Avici Tower as well!

354
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:39,960
Yes.

355
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:40,970
Old Madam Tang,

356
00:28:41,790 --> 00:28:42,920
why must you do this?

357
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:46,310
Earlier, when the Power Gang's demon
recognized me,

358
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,450
you sent someone
to help me out of that situation.

359
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,510
With Insect Valley being the location
for the Night of Yin-Hai,

360
00:28:53,510 --> 00:28:55,440
you knew something would go wrong,

361
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,410
yet you didn't stop Tang Song.

362
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,540
Those contradictory actions

363
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,250
were deliberately planned by you, right?

364
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:03,680
Why would I do that?

365
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,540
Because you wanted to clean house

366
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,810
without offending the Power Gang.

367
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:10,920
So you used me

368
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,110
to eliminate the wolves
that invaded your home

369
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,480
and incidentally exposed Tang Song.

370
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,370
If that's the case,

371
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,480
Tang Fang didn't violate sect rules

372
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,640
by secretly bringing me into Tang Sect.

373
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,900
Rather, she understood your intentions

374
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,050
and acted in advance

375
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,030
to ease your burdens.

376
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,750
I don't understand

377
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:40,200
what you're saying.

378
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,720
Xiao Qiushui,
you entered Tang Sect without permission.

379
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,000
If I simply let you leave Tang Sect,

380
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:50,350
I'm afraid it would break our rules.

381
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,480
Xiao Qiushui,

382
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:11,400
since you have
Tang Sect's invitation token,

383
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,590
I will overlook today's offenses

384
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,770
by you and Tang Fang.

385
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,280
Since Tang Fang is innocent,

386
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,800
the first branch remains the first branch!

387
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,440
After such a long night,

388
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:24,350
go back and rest early!

389
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,800
Why didn't you dodge
Old Madam Tang's strike?

390
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,110
That strike

391
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,890
was a show for Tang Sect's members.

392
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,660
And it was meant to establish authority.

393
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,340
Of course I couldn't dodge it.

394
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,480
Are you alright?

395
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,590
I'm fine.

396
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,680
There's no time to waste.

397
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,880
Let's leave quickly.

398
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,570
I painstakingly planted Sword King,

399
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:11,710
and he was actually removed
just like that.

400
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
I underestimated you.

401
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,640
Master!

402
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:44,720
Master, your injuries are severe.
You need rest.

403
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,110
Don't force yourself
to use your energy again.

404
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,910
Destroying my Death Beetle King

405
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,730
and killing 2 kings in a row—

406
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,830
Xiao Qiushui killed 3 birds with 1 stone.

407
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:55,960
What a vicious plot.

408
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:57,200
Master,

409
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:00,680
should we tell Chief about this?

410
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,650
Liu Suifeng!

411
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,830
Liu Suifeng,

412
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,000
don't you think you owe us

413
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,260
an explanation today?

414
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:12,450
Blade King,

415
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:15,720
who gave you the nerve
to disrespect the Deputy Chief?

416
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,680
What are you all doing here uninvited?

417
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,740
Are you rebelling?

418
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,600
I don't need to explain anything to you.

419
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,830
Liu Suifeng,

420
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:26,350
spare us your smooth talk.

421
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,790
The Eight Kings were established

422
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,480
to check your authority.

423
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,180
The gang has its rules.

424
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,310
Even if Chief lets you off today,

425
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:37,110
we will not let this go.

426
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,880
With the Misery Pills gone,

427
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,240
you came to surround me
without Chief's order.

428
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,400
Are you respecting the gang's rules?

429
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,440
They say you never miss a step,

430
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:56,760
yet you've failed repeatedly
due to Xiao Qiushui.

431
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,240
Is your reputation

432
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,720
undeserved?

433
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,980
Or was it intentional?

434
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,790
Why waste words on him?

435
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:04,270
Let's just finish him

436
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,790
before his schemes cause more trouble.

437
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,640
Everyone, wait.

438
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,750
I am at fault.

439
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,090
I will accept Chief's punishment.

440
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,920
But if anyone seeks to overstep his rank
and plot a rebellion,

441
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:38,160
I still have the strength
to clean house for Chief.

442
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,350
Who's rebelling?

443
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:41,550
We are unwaveringly loyal to Chief,

444
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,270
but toward you, it's a different matter.

445
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:45,440
You overstepped boundaries,
and you're arrogant.

446
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,830
Today, even if I die, I will punish you.

447
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,830
This blade was made for you.

448
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,850
-Greetings, Chief.
-Greetings, Chief.

449
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,060
Suifeng's failure

450
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,320
was due to Sword King's hidden disloyalty.

451
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,760
If anyone is to blame,

452
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:16,190
I should be blamed
for focusing only on my own plans.

453
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,480
Over the past few years,

454
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:21,840
I've neglected the private grudges
brewing within our gang.

455
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,770
That has allowed others to exploit

456
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,400
our internal conflicts to cause trouble.

457
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:36,280
The Misery Pills

458
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:39,870
were meant to prevent you
from killing each other.

459
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,940
But if they breed resentment,

460
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,920
I won't use them again.

461
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,080
Today, regarding what I'm really up to,

462
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:53,230
I do owe you all an explanation.

463
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:27,400
Father,

464
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,070
Mother,

465
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:31,810
I've failed you.

466
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:36,040
I still haven't been able
to rebuild Huanhua.

467
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,730
I can't even protect the sword manual now.

468
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,000
How can I ever rebuild Huanhua?

469
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,960
I'm useless.

470
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,000
Yiren.

471
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,440
Don't blame yourself too much.

472
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:53,960
Xueyu,

473
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,680
the Nangong family came to provoke us.

474
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,560
Although with a sword in my hand,

475
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,400
I can do nothing.

476
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,150
I'm so useless.

477
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,590
Now everyone is kicking us
while we're down.

478
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:15,040
I'm afraid
we can't even stay in Jindu anymore.

479
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,190
But don't worry.

480
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:20,610
Even if it costs me my life,

481
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,920
I will protect you.

482
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,550
Yiren,

483
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,230
you've borne so much for the Xiao family.

484
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:38,840
I

485
00:36:40,550 --> 00:36:42,710
also wish to rebuild Huanhua

486
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,330
to comfort our parents' souls in heaven.

487
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,440
I am...

488
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:00,560
willing to marry Nangong Wushang.

489
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,030
No, Xueyu.

490
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:11,010
You can't marry him
for the sake of the sword manual.

491
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,320
This is the only thing

492
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,510
I can do now.

493
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,030
I can never repay Father and Mother
for raising me.

494
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,060
I am willing to marry Nangong Wushang

495
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,870
to repay the Xiao family and our parents

496
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,840
with my life.

497
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:45,190
After all, you did take a palm strike.

498
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,120
Don't ignore it.

499
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,230
This medicine can help you recover.

500
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,150
Thank you.

501
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,000
Why aren't you sitting?

502
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,030
Here.

503
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:10,840
I already told you

504
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
to rest properly,

505
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,440
yet you insisted
on coming all the way out here.

506
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,120
I won't go far.

507
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,260
Don't worry, Doctor Tang.

508
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:28,920
Can you stop pulling a long face
like an eggplant?

509
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,050
I can't believe you.

510
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,070
Big Brother.

511
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,800
Big Brother.

512
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,650
Seems like we came at a bad time.

513
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,030
I'm parched.

514
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,040
Did you put sugar in this tea?

515
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,520
And you put a lot in it.

516
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:54,090
It's making my teeth ache.

517
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:01,710
Qiu,

518
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,050
your zither looks pretty nice.

519
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:06,880
How about we brothers
play a piece together?

520
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,110
What's wrong with you?

521
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,150
Him?

522
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:19,960
Our famously charming Mr. Zuoqiu

523
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,710
might soon be saying goodbye
to his carefree playboy days.

524
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,170
You're reluctant, right?

525
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,560
I thought I could outdrink Qu Mushuang.

526
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,590
I planned to tell her after winning

527
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,510
that it's not her younger sister I like.

528
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:32,710
The one I like is her.

529
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,160
This is too complicated.

530
00:40:40,590 --> 00:40:42,000
Although I practice the Joint Lock,

531
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,230
my master once told me

532
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,230
that the Qu family's best technique,
Spring Night,

533
00:40:45,230 --> 00:40:46,960
resembles the thread-twining joint lock,

534
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,320
soft as a spring breeze entering dreams.

535
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,480
It breaks moves quietly,

536
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,710
and its grace is unmatched in this world.

537
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,770
I didn't believe it

538
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,480
until that day Qu Mushuang
drew her sword to save me.

539
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,710
Only then did I realize

540
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,280
that all the sword techniques
I've ever seen

541
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,030
can't compare to those
Qu Mushuang displayed

542
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:00,840
to save me.

543
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:06,000
If that's the case, why don't you

544
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,980
just tell Mushuang directly?

545
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,670
Qu Mushuang is stubborn
and protective of those close to her.

546
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:17,110
Now Qu Minmiao likes Chaoran.

547
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,230
If Chaoran tells Qu Mushuang

548
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:20,760
that she's the one he likes,

549
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,840
I'm worried that Qu Mushuang

550
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,100
might cut ties with Chaoran completely.

551
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,730
Miss Tang is right.

552
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,030
Qiu,

553
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,760
you should

554
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,190
say it clearly to them in the first place.

555
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:39,250
Do you understand?

556
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:42,030
Qiushui, I'm back!
