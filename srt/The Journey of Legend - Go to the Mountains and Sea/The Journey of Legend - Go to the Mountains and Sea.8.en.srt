[Qunfang House]

4
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,350
Miss Hongxiu.

5
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,240
Someone is causing us trouble.

6
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,370
I wonder if we could

7
00:01:53,509 --> 00:01:54,710
hide here for a while.

8
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,509
Third Young Master, what are you saying?

9
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,840
Everyone knows that the Xiao Residence

10
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,700
is under siege.

11
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,410
I heard your family

12
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,560
is doing something important
for the country and its people.

13
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,950
As a mere courtesan,

14
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,210
I'm happy to offer what little help I can.

15
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,210
Thank you.

16
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,240
No need to thank me.

17
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
Besides,

18
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,920
aren't you a regular here?

19
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,920
It's only right that I help you.

20
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,430
I'm... not.

21
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,400
Mister, please don't misunderstand.

22
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,760
Third Young Master used to come here

23
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,990
to help these girls.

24
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,680
When thugs bullied them,

25
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,680
only he treated us like human beings

26
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,770
and stood up for us.

27
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,900
We're all grateful for his kindness.

28
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:42,280
It was the right thing to do.

29
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:44,350
By the way,

30
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,710
this place is too conspicuous

31
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:46,680
and not very safe.

32
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,740
I'll take you to another place later.

33
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:52,590
How can we leave town now?

34
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,280
Leave town?

35
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:57,760
All roads out of town
are blocked by those men.

36
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,830
We need to find a way out.

37
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,910
Oh right, there's a party
outside out of town today.

38
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:07,070
They requested some girls
for entertainment.

39
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:07,950
Unless...

40
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,040
Unless what?

41
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:13,730
Unless you disguise yourselves
as girls from here.

42
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,070
No way.

43
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,680
Absolutely not.

44
00:03:19,910 --> 00:03:21,280
That makes things difficult.

45
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,010
What about the night soil cart?

46
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,910
The night soil cart smells terrible.

47
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,680
They probably won't check it carefully.

48
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,560
If you go with the cart,

49
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,020
you might slip out of town.

50
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,079
I'll go look into it now.

51
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,120
What if...

52
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,760
Don't you usually have many clever ideas?

53
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:38,520
Are we really going to
hide in that stinking cart?

54
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,490
There's no time.

55
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,600
The meeting point has changed.

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,329
Old Madam Wu and the others
don't know yet.

57
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,190
I must leave town quickly

58
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,430
and find Old Madam Wu.

59
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,430
Master.

60
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,800
I've searched all the main roads
from the Xiao Residence,

61
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,730
but there's no sign of Old Madam Wu.

62
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,870
I don't know where she is now.

63
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,490
No need to search anymore.

64
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,140
This Xiao Qiushui
always has unusual ideas.

65
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,040
Even I was deceived about
Old Madam Wu's whereabouts.

66
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,500
You won't find her either.

67
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,829
It's my fault for being so slow-witted.

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,390
What should we do next?

69
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,310
The Sword King's men
are all over the streets.

70
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,310
I wondered why he

71
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,520
didn't confront me at Huanhua Sect.

72
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,470
Turns out he was
setting an ambush out here.

73
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,670
He wants to reap the benefits in the end.

74
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,409
But Xiao Qiushui
hasn't met with Old Madam Wu yet.

75
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,680
Why is the Sword King so confident?

76
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,510
He's able to hold back his forces

77
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:41,310
yet specifically set up checkpoints here.

78
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,770
This proves Xiao Qiushui's guess
was right.

79
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,580
There must be another spy
close to Old Madam Wu.

80
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,370
All our spies have taken Misery Pills

81
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,330
and are registered in our records.

82
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,180
Mr. Qiu is our only spy
in the Xiao Residence.

83
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,690
That nameless person?

84
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,070
The Nameless Demon?

85
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:01,360
All these years,

86
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,800
among all the Sword King's people,

87
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,000
only this Nameless Demon

88
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,330
remains unidentified.

89
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,960
You follow me in secret.

90
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:10,850
Xiao Qiushui

91
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,560
will lead us to Old Madam Wu himself.

92
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,160
By then,

93
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,080
the Nameless Demon will surely appear.

94
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:22,000
I want to see who this person really is.

95
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,000
What's going on?

96
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,220
You took so long just to get some food.

97
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:26,200
People are searching everywhere outside.

98
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,760
I had to be extra cautious.

99
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,450
What's the point of writing down
these sects?

100
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:45,240
My mother said

101
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,650
these sects have good relations
with the Xiao family.

102
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,260
After we send off Old Madam Wu,

103
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,820
I'll ask them for help.

104
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,730
Righteousness always comes first
in the martial world.

105
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,040
I believe

106
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,360
they will help us.

107
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,200
Don't be too optimistic, Mr. Xiao.

108
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,800
Throughout history,

109
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,000
people only pursue two things:

110
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,800
power and profit.

111
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,240
Those with aligned interests
become friends.

112
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,700
Currently, the Power Gang

113
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,610
can offer substantial benefits.

114
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,140
So Huanhua Sect's friends

115
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,170
became the Power Gang's friends.

116
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,750
You're saying they'll stand by
and do nothing?

117
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,190
Everyone acts for their own interests.

118
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,220
This martial world gathers for gain.

119
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:41,210
It's always been this way.

120
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,070
No.

121
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,830
I used to read stories
about the martial world.

122
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:56,360
They had flashing blades,
revenge and honor.

123
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,750
But stories are just stories.

124
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,600
Now that I'm in this world,

125
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,510
this is exactly where I wanted to be.

126
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:12,630
There will always be some people
who fear nothing.

127
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,260
They stand up for what's right

128
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,740
and fight for the weak.

129
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,860
But how many people

130
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,350
are like that?

131
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,030
I don't know.

132
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,870
But my father told me

133
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:55,320
even a tiny spark can start a blaze.

134
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,080
Those with righteous hearts

135
00:08:58,270 --> 00:09:01,080
will always find each other.

136
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,440
So that's why...

137
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,240
Chivalry is the foundation
of the martial world.

138
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,600
Let's make a bet

139
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:18,600
to see if this martial world
gathers for gain

140
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,270
or chivalry.

141
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,360
Fine.

142
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:28,960
I'll bet with you.

143
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,810
What are you wagering?

144
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:32,360
The winner

145
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,030
can take one treasured item
from the loser.

146
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:36,030
A treasured item?

147
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,730
Just a suggestion.

148
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:43,120
I'm only trying to
use something intimidating

149
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,120
to wake you up.

150
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,430
If you don't like it,
we can choose something else.

151
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,480
No problem.

152
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,840
I'll take that bet,

153
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,950
but you're going to lose.

154
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,080
I hope so.

155
00:09:58,750 --> 00:09:59,880
Third Young Master!

156
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,720
There's a problem.

157
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,550
Zhang Si just told me the cart broke down.

158
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:11,080
He can't go out to dump
the night soil tonight.

159
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,970
But we must leave town tonight.

160
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,480
Hongxiu, how about this?

161
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,240
Go find me a black cloak

162
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,660
and get a carriage.

163
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:23,510
How do you plan to leave town?

164
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:24,870
Fight fire with fire.

165
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,250
Since the Power Gang is looking for us,

166
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,840
why don't we pretend to be their members?

167
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:32,030
This...

168
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,120
Don't worry.

169
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,270
What's your plan?

170
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,510
Tang Rou and the others
helped me write about

171
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,630
many famous figures in the martial world.

172
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,360
I've discovered that this Power Gang

173
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,870
not only has many members,

174
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,050
but also has spies everywhere.

175
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,840
They're not even united.

176
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:04,960
So,

177
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,200
according to my deduction,

178
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,480
very few people know

179
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:12,320
how Li Chenzhou, Zhao Shirong,
and Liu Suifeng

180
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,450
actually look like.

181
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,390
What?

182
00:11:16,270 --> 00:11:17,730
You want to be Li Chenzhou?

183
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:19,030
Wrong.

184
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,510
Li Chenzhou is too high and mighty.

185
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:23,310
How could he possibly come here?

186
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,840
I want to be Liu Suifeng.

187
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,930
Hand it over.

188
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,150
If I remember correctly,

189
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,910
this Liu Suifeng also has a white fan.

190
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,260
Let me borrow this.

191
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:10,840
But Liu Suifeng's subordinate,
Song Mingzhu,

192
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,900
just arrived here.

193
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,500
Aren't you afraid she'll notice you?

194
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,790
I can tell your observation skills
are poor.

195
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:19,550
Who was chasing us

196
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,200
all along this journey?

197
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,790
Have you thought carefully about it?

198
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:24,000
The people hunting us

199
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,720
were wearing different colored clothing.

200
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,090
Then who do you want me to impersonate?

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:32,910
Zhao Shirong.

202
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:33,840
No way.

203
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,090
You're being difficult again.

204
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,270
Why don't you pretend to be Zhao Shirong

205
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,000
and I pretend to be Liu Suifeng?

206
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,240
What's wrong with your memory?

207
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,960
You have a grudge with the Power Gang.

208
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,440
You shouldn't show your face in public.

209
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,900
Just stay in the carriage
and don't come out.

210
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,850
Don't worry.

211
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:51,840
I absolutely won't make you
dress as a woman.

212
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,750
I won't make you
wear women's clothes either.

213
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,600
You've been in the martial world
for so many years.

214
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,840
You must know something about them.

215
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,610
Just don't mess things up
when the time comes.

216
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,870
Use the fan well.

217
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:20,590
[Lingliang Town]

218
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:22,750
[Annihilation Demon, Xinhu Hill]

219
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,150
Stop right there!

220
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,570
Didn't you hear me?

221
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:31,750
No one is allowed to leave town.

222
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,940
You bunch of dogs,

223
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,360
how dare you stop this carriage?

224
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,580
Who is speaking so boldly?

225
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,840
A plain fan with a five-petal orchid.

226
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,750
Could it be Deputy Chief Liu?

227
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,700
Is that the Chief's wife in the carriage?

228
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,840
Is that any of your business?

229
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,550
It's not that I don't believe you.

230
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:26,340
I just have orders
to guard this place.

231
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,600
I cannot be negligent.

232
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,120
Few in our gang have ever seen

233
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,720
the Chief's wife and Deputy Chief Liu.

234
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,480
Could you show me
the Deputy Chief's token?

235
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:38,070
You must be tired of living.

236
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:48,790
Years ago,

237
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,880
I once accidentally glimpsed

238
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,560
the back of the Madam in the gang.

239
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:03,850
How dare you

240
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,480
offend the Madam?

241
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,980
I humbly dare.

242
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,840
That was the Flowing Cloud Sleeve?

243
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,840
It really is the Chief's wife.

244
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,770
Get out of my way.

245
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,250
I deserve to die.

246
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,380
Everyone, step aside!

247
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,960
Bow.

248
00:15:43,230 --> 00:15:43,990
Thank you.

249
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:47,200
If you meet Miss Hongxiu again,

250
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,680
please return this garment to her.

251
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,270
Alright.

252
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,600
We must first thank you, sir.

253
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,200
Otherwise, who knows

254
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,600
how long we'd be trapped

255
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,860
in Lingliang Town for?

256
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,390
Sir, we'll take our leave now.

257
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:00,510
Farewell.

258
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,550
Mr. Xiao, let's get going too.

259
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:14,740
I just saw you seem to have used

260
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:17,600
Zhao Shirong's
Flowing Cloud Sleeve technique.

261
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,550
You know how to do it too?

262
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,730
It's just some tricks to scare people.

263
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,720
Haven't you always called me Lucky Bag?

264
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,920
I ought to know some rare tricks, right?

265
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,600
It's getting late. Let's go.

266
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:35,930
Does Feng Lang know this much?

267
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,330
Never mind.

268
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,150
Meeting with Old Madam Wu is more urgent.

269
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,410
I wonder if Yiren has reached Guangling.

270
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,360
Once this matter is settled,

271
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,490
I'll tell Yiren to bring Shinian back.

272
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,530
He can also help Huanhua Sect.

273
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,650
You're so slow.

274
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,470
I thought you'd been caught.

275
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,120
We had to use
quite some tricks to get out.

276
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,180
How did it go? Did you see Old Madam Wu?

277
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,270
I've been watching all day.

278
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,470
People came and went.

279
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:03,560
I only found Power Gang's minions.

280
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,000
Did you find our contact?

281
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,510
He left a letter

282
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,640
and changed the meeting place.

283
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,170
He told me to bring Old Madam Wu
to the meeting.

284
00:17:11,109 --> 00:17:12,880
Where should we go now?

285
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,069
They must have left markers along the way.

286
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,829
If we find the marker,

287
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,829
we might be able to find Old Madam Wu.

288
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,079
Let's go.

289
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,130
Don't be afraid.

290
00:18:05,270 --> 00:18:07,680
He passed out
because the poison reached his heart.

291
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:10,410
Fortunately,
he's regained consciousness now.

292
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,920
Thank you for your help.

293
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,810
Don't be afraid.

294
00:18:15,310 --> 00:18:16,910
We're from the Huanhua Sect.

295
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:20,270
What exactly happened here?

296
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:23,200
They were making medicinal pills here.

297
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,170
They forced us to test them.

298
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,690
If we refused, they would kill us.

299
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,960
If we obeyed and took their pills,

300
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,310
most of us

301
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,270
went mad

302
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,670
and died from poisoning.

303
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,630
What kind of pills were they?

304
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,750
I only know that after taking their pills,

305
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,920
we felt neither tired nor hungry,

306
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,180
but we became violent.

307
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,520
It's indeed the Marching Pill.

308
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,750
Who were the people
that forced you to make these pills?

309
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:57,680
Could they be Northern Wastelanders?

310
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,160
No.

311
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:01,200
They're from the martial world.

312
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,440
I saw their tokens had a cauldron symbol
carved on them.

313
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,740
A cauldron symbol?

314
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:08,790
Yiren,

315
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:11,050
could it be the Power Gang?

316
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,070
Are there any other survivors?

317
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:15,640
Well...

318
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,170
Don't worry.

319
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:20,070
My sister is a skilled physician.

320
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,790
She can definitely heal you all.

321
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,200
Miss, please save us.

322
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:26,590
Rest assured.

323
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,000
We should arrive
after walking a bit further.

324
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,530
Let's go.

[Huanhua Sect Guangling Villa]

Yiren, Kaiyan, Xueyu!

328
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,310
Xiaoyi?

329
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,450
Xiaoyi, what brings you here?

330
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,240
I knew you all came to Guangling,

331
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,590
so I had to come see you.

332
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,970
It's been over three years
since we last parted.

333
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,680
How are all the elders and siblings

334
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,280
in the Nangong family doing?

335
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,920
They're all doing well.

336
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,480
Yiren, you must be tired
from your journey.

337
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,750
If we can get to the bottom
of this Marching Pill matter,

338
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,610
this little hardship is nothing.

339
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,360
However, this case is indeed quite tricky.

340
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,400
Let's go inside and talk.

341
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,400
Yiren.

342
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,110
I think we should just drop it.

343
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,350
In today's martial world,

344
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,280
who dares to offend the Power Gang?

345
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,180
If we keep pursuing this,
we'll bring trouble upon ourselves.

346
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:17,290
But Yiren came here

347
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,200
precisely because our family
has a responsibility to uncover the truth.

348
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,000
How can we back down from trouble?

349
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,680
Yes.

350
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,880
But knowing our limits isn't wrong either.

351
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:31,710
We should certainly view
the martial world's affairs as our own.

352
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,590
But this is the Power Gang
we're talking about.

353
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,000
Yiren,

354
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,340
why don't we ask Father first?

355
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,480
The Marching Pill matter
is of great importance.

356
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,540
Making enemies rashly
will only harm the Huanhua Sect.

357
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,960
Then send a message by carrier pigeon
to Huanhua Sect immediately.

358
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:56,590
We'll make a decision
after consulting with Father.

359
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,190
All right.

360
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,350
-Third Young Master.
-Third Young Master.

361
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,240
How is everyone doing?

-Big Brother.
-Big Brother.

363
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,220
You're finally here.

364
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:16,640
We found that Lingliang Town
has been taken over by the Power Gang.

365
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,310
We had to settle in this rundown place.

366
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:20,160
We were worried you wouldn't find us.

367
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:20,920
I told you

368
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,880
Qiushui would never overlook my signal.

369
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,680
Why do you do whatever this person says?

370
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,740
You didn't even tell your sister.

371
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,920
Fang, I mean...

372
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,150
I trust your martial arts skills

373
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:33,880
and Big Brother's strategies.

374
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,310
Didn't everything work out fine?

375
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:36,370
Enough, all of you.

376
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,450
I got a letter from Tongfu Inn.

377
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,590
I need to see Old Madam Wu immediately.

378
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,400
Let's go now.

379
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,350
Qiushui.

380
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:47,200
Jiesheng and I just found this place.

381
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,330
Sorry for the delay.

382
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,690
Uncle Kang.

383
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,490
Fortunately, Qiushui brought a message
from Lingliang Town.

384
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:03,070
Otherwise, we might've missed the news
about this meeting.

385
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,200
How is the Xiao family doing now?

386
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,430
Once General Wu's troops arrive tomorrow,

387
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:12,160
I'll seek help
from allies in the martial world

388
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:13,620
to rescue the Xiao family.

389
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,130
Please rest assured, Old Madam Wu.

390
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,320
I'll keep track of the time.

391
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,640
That's good then.

392
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:23,160
Good.

393
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,500
Everyone who escaped from
the Xiao Residence has finally gathered.

394
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,000
Old Madam Wu.

395
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,110
The letter says the meeting place
is not far from here.

396
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,400
It's already quite late.

397
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,200
Why don't we head there now?

398
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:39,070
Since it's not far
and everyone is exhausted from traveling,

399
00:23:39,070 --> 00:23:41,000
we'd better rest for a while first.

400
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:42,960
All right.

401
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,160
Qiushui.

402
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,810
After tomorrow's matter is settled,

403
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,120
I will personally take you to seek help.

404
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,610
Thank you, Uncle Kang.

405
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,270
Mr. Kang, Third Young Master,
the porridge is ready.

406
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,200
Take it to the people inside first.

407
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,140
How's this blade? Take a look.

408
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,880
Old Madam Wu, Mr. Zhang,

409
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,490
please have some porridge.

410
00:24:27,110 --> 00:24:31,720
Mr. Zhang, thank you for escorting me
all the way. You've worked hard.

411
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,970
Thank you, Old Madam Wu.

412
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,680
Something's wrong with this porridge!

413
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:08,440
Mr. Zhang!

414
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,410
Old Madam Wu.

415
00:25:10,030 --> 00:25:10,590
Are you all right?

416
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,310
I'm fine.

417
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,240
You've all been poisoned
with a muscle relaxant.

418
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,170
Let's see how long you can hold out.

419
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,440
Uncle Kang, you...

420
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:35,900
This is hardly the time

421
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,360
to still call him "Uncle."

422
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,460
You're quite the actor.

423
00:25:43,030 --> 00:25:44,560
You're from the Power Gang.

424
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:48,810
[Kang Chuyu]
[The Power Gang's Nameless Demon]

425
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,830
All these years,
to solve problems for the gang,

426
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,830
I had to protect my reputation.

427
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:58,480
I was treading on thin ice every day.

428
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,810
Otherwise, how could I have
let you take advantage of things

429
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,680
and even nominated you
as the young leader?

430
00:26:08,310 --> 00:26:10,920
Xiao Qiushui, I must kill you today

431
00:26:11,350 --> 00:26:13,550
to vent the hatred I've been harboring.

432
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,170
Do you really think that the two of you

433
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,400
can kill all of us?

434
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:23,380
Who said there are only two of us?

435
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:29,600
Watch out!

436
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:40,920
Take Old Madam Wu away first.
I'll hold them off.

437
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,450
Alright.

438
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,640
What's that?

439
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,580
Who is that demon on horseback?

440
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:09,110
[Yan Guigui]
[The Power Gang's Iron Cavalry Demon]

441
00:27:07,510 --> 00:27:09,550
That's Yan Guigui, the Iron Cavalry Demon.

442
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,680
He's nothing but a beast.

443
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,880
He shows no humanity.

444
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:15,620
Protect Old Madam Wu well.

445
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,500
Zuoqiu, Yuhan!

446
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,890
Old Madam Wu.

447
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,420
It's Song Mingzhu.

448
00:28:57,420 --> 00:28:58,810
She stole Old Madam Wu's bundle.

449
00:28:58,810 --> 00:28:59,720
I'll go after her.

450
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,320
Feng Lang!

451
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:02,350
Young hero, don't chase her!

452
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:06,390
The Hero Command Token is actually kept in
the Nirvana Case.

453
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:07,880
She won't be able to open it.

454
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,880
Once opened,

455
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,960
the gold-melting water inside
will dissolve the Hero Command Token.

456
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,960
There has been too much bloodshed
along this journey.

457
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,490
The Hero Command Token...

458
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,220
Let it dissolve.

459
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:28,230
Old Madam Wu,
your safety is what matters most.

460
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,930
Big Brother, I'll go after them.

461
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:33,490
Be careful.

462
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,360
Shorty?

463
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:44,010
There are actually two people
inside Yan Guigui's armor?

464
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,170
I've been the legs for 10 years.

465
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,030
Thank you for killing my brother!

466
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,630
I can finally be the head now!

467
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,030
Brothers, protect Old Madam Wu well.

468
00:29:58,360 --> 00:29:59,890
Are you two going to kill me?

469
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:01,400
Are you looking down on me?

470
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,000
Yep.

471
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,530
You seem far weaker than your brother.

472
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:42,840
Let's go.

473
00:31:07,610 --> 00:31:09,740
Old Madam Wu is our priority. Let's go.

474
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:15,880
Master.

475
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,070
It is indeed the Nirvana Case.

476
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:29,960
Just as I glimpsed earlier,

477
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,890
this is exactly what it looks like.

478
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,560
Forcing this box open

479
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,110
will destroy the Hero Command Token.

480
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,720
Old Madam Wu is
the mother of a great general.

481
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,780
If we threaten her,

482
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:40,050
she will never tell us
how to open the box.

483
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,270
So you're planning

484
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,800
to trick Old Madam Wu
into opening it herself?

485
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:48,480
Master!

486
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,050
I injured myself.
It has nothing to do with you.

487
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:56,710
No matter what happens later,

488
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,530
you must not show yourself.

489
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,120
Don't move!

490
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,890
Old Madam Wu!

491
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:13,770
Zuoqiu!

492
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,240
Old Madam Wu,

493
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:23,070
my son and I
finally managed to lose Zhang Linyi

494
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:24,030
and came here.

495
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:27,320
And now you tell me
the Hero Command Token is gone?

496
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,200
Should I...

497
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,680
Kill another person

498
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,510
to help you think carefully?

499
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:35,720
You!

500
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,160
Kang Chuyu, stop!

501
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,200
-Big Brother!
-Fang!

502
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,000
Kang Chuyu,

503
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,050
you're truly despicable.

504
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,860
My father has known you for years,

505
00:32:57,830 --> 00:32:59,110
yet he misjudged you.

506
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,240
Tell me,

507
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:03,110
what did the Power Gang offer you?

508
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,790
I was already the Power Gang's demon
long before I became famous.

509
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,310
I've just been hiding my identity.

510
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,790
No one bribed me.

511
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,820
So you're the Nameless Demon!

512
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,720
Nameless yet famous.

513
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,170
Whoever the gang needs me to be,

514
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,640
that's who I am.

515
00:33:22,350 --> 00:33:23,750
Too afraid to have a name,

516
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,830
yet pretending to be a hero for years.

517
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:26,830
How pathetic.

518
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,480
Say what you want.

519
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,930
I only want the Hero Command Token.

520
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,680
Where is it?

521
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,640
Where is it?

522
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,550
Tell me where it is now!

523
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:41,410
Stop shouting.

524
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,480
Song Mingzhu took the Hero Command Token.

525
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,590
She abandoned you
to claim the credit herself.

526
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,390
The Nameless Demon, Kang Chuyu,

527
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:50,210
will be known
throughout Jiangnan by tomorrow.

528
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:51,340
Not necessarily.

529
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:54,240
If you all die here today,

530
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,750
I'll remain nameless.

531
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,620
Kang Chuyu,

532
00:34:01,350 --> 00:34:03,280
still defiant in the face of death?

533
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:08,480
Then I'll kill your friend first.

534
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,110
No!

535
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:11,670
Wait!

536
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:17,050
Here's the Hero Command Token.
Don't hurt anyone.

537
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,989
You're wounded?

538
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:24,040
It's nothing.

539
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,219
Feng Lang!

540
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,159
Catch!

541
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,030
Fang!

542
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,070
Big Brother!

543
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:21,930
Tang Rou!

544
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:22,730
Fall in line!

545
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,930
-Old Madam Wu, I’m late.
-Old Madam Wu.

546
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:25,600
Tang Rou.

547
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:29,320
Tang Rou!

548
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:29,930
Tang Rou!

549
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:33,150
Tang Rou.

550
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,030
