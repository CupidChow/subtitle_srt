00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,950
[Episode 7]

3
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,110
I knew it.

4
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:47,000
Yes.

5
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,340
Bad news! Bad news!

6
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,130
The woodshed is on fire!

7
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,680
The woodshed is on fire?

8
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,350
Go, go, go!

9
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:53,870
Hurry!

10
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,479
Move!

11
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,310
Hurry!

12
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,400
Wait.

13
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,840
It's a diversion.

14
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:02,710
Let's go to Zhenmei Pavilion.

15
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,240
Alright.

16
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:09,070
[Zhenmei Pavilion]

17
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,560
Come on.

18
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:06,920
What...

19
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,419
What's happening?

20
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,430
I have no idea.

21
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:43,079
Stop!

22
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,420
Why did he suddenly kill himself?

23
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,800
What are you guys doing here?

24
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,280
I came to Miss Tang
to get my jade pendant back.

25
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,070
I didn't expect to run into this.

26
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,800
I saw him sneaking over here,

27
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,079
so I followed him.

28
00:03:19,079 --> 00:03:21,010
Unexpectedly, as soon as he saw me,

29
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,340
he tried to kill me.

30
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,640
Xilou, they must have been knocked out
by some kind of powder.

31
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,860
Mr. Qiu has served the Xiao family
for so many years.

32
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,430
I never thought he'd be a spy
for the Power Gang.

33
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:42,880
Let me ask you.

34
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,290
What else did Mr. Qiu do today?

35
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,710
He usually cleaned the Sword Manor.

36
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,770
Today, he just went to the woodshed

37
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,800
and helped Ms. Zhang water the flowers.

38
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,190
The woodshed caught on fire just now.

39
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,790
It was meant to lure us there.

40
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,310
Father, Mother,
when he watered the flowers,

41
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,270
he actually went to administer poison.

42
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,330
Pass down my order:

43
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:27,360
no one in the Xiao Residence
is to draw water from the well.

44
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,240
Go check

45
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,800
if the well has been poisoned.

46
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:31,870
Yes.

47
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,300
There's only one well in the Sword Manor.

48
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,480
Now that it's poisoned,

49
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,870
they mean to wipe us all out.

50
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,390
Oh no! I just had the servants draw water

51
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,190
to make soup

52
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,310
and deliver it to Zhenmei Pavilion.

53
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,800
You…

54
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:51,480
Let's go.

55
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,800
Mr. Zhang.

56
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:01,830
Mr. Xiao.

57
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,870
What has happened?

58
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,360
Someone poisoned the well.

59
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,310
The soup that was just
brought here is poisonous.

60
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,240
Mr. Xiao.

61
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,560
Don't worry.

62
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,270
I haven't touched that soup yet.

63
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,560
In this case,

64
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,000
there's no need to keep it a secret.

65
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,680
Go call everyone here.

66
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,740
Everyone, this is Old Madam Wu.

67
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,760
Greetings, Old Madam Wu.

68
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,750
Greetings.

69
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,310
Please be seated.

70
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,050
Thank you, Old Madam Wu.

71
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:57,870
Old Madam Wu,

72
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,560
these are all heroes
who have stood with the Xiao family

73
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,680
against the Power Gang.

74
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,270
When I learned you were
all fighting the Power Gang out there,

75
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,750
I couldn't eat or sleep in peace.

76
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,360
I had no appetite for that soup,

77
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,780
so I luckily escaped being poisoned.

78
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:23,920
Old Madam Wu, why have you
come to the Sword Manor?

79
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,890
I was going to the Immortal Pass
to look for my son,

80
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:29,480
but while passing through Jinzhong,

81
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,190
I was stopped by a group of people
from the martial world.

82
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,190
They demanded that I hand over
the Hero Command Token.

83
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,610
Thankfully, Mr. Xiao came to my rescue

84
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,740
and let me hide here.

85
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,740
Old Madam Wu,

86
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,240
there's something I don't understand,

87
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,440
and I'd like to ask you about it,
if I may.

88
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Please, go ahead.

89
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,610
Old Madam Wu,
you're not from the martial world.

90
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,720
Why do those people believe
the Hero Command Token

91
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,680
is in your hands?

92
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,600
Thirteen years ago,

93
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,570
the Beihuang Army rampaged

94
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,800
and seized our lands by force.

95
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,120
They marched into Daxi

96
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,390
and committed atrocities on our lands,

97
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,380
doing whatever they pleased.

98
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,190
People became homeless refugees.

99
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:19,390
Protect His Majesty!

100
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,270
The emperor was forced
to flee the capital.

101
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,630
Daxi was on the brink of ruin.

102
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,120
At that time,

103
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,000
the leaders of Shaolin,
Wudang, and Emei Sects

104
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,340
gathered heroes from across the country

105
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,270
and forged the Hero Command Token

106
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,630
with a crystal from the stars.

107
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,480
They also swore a blood oath:

108
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,270
whoever could save Daxi from destruction

109
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,950
would be awarded that token.

110
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,070
And in the end,

111
00:07:54,409 --> 00:07:56,650
someone truly did.

112
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,920
Crazy Yan?

113
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:01,230
That's right.

114
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,560
Crazy Yan broke into
the Beihuang Army's camp,

115
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,120
killed 37 elite guards,

116
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,290
and nearly took
the enemy commander's life.

117
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,320
So Crazy Yan got the Hero Command Token.

118
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,909
But he was too arrogant,

119
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,809
shunned by the martial world.

120
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,960
After being besieged at Wuxing Mountain,

121
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,510
he vanished without a trace—

122
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,390
until recently,

123
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:51,120
when he sent the token to me via a falcon.

124
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:55,910
So the Hero Command Token

125
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:57,840
was entrusted to you

126
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,360
by Crazy Yan on purpose.

127
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:01,630
Exactly.

128
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,510
The Power Gang

129
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:09,670
somehow learned that I had the token

130
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,440
and began hunting me down,

131
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,840
hurting innocents along the way
and causing needless bloodshed.

132
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,600
Mr. Xiao.

133
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,960
What's the situation outside now?

134
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:28,670
The Power Gang has indeed
sent many men this time,

135
00:09:29,030 --> 00:09:31,960
but the Sword Manor is well defended.

136
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,050
They won't be able to break in.

137
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,000
However...

138
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,290
Please, speak freely.

139
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,000
They've poisoned the only well

140
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,790
in the Sword Manor.

141
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:53,720
We'll run out of the remaining water soon.

142
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,000
Once again, I've put everyone in danger.

143
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,670
I feel terrible about this.

144
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:04,390
Old Madam Wu, you mustn't say that.

145
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:07,600
General Wu has served the country
with absolute loyalty.

146
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,440
He is a hero to us all.

147
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,600
Throughout all of Daxi,

148
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,630
only General Wu is
worthy of the Hero Command Token.

149
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,000
This time,

150
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,960
it's truly

151
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,720
the Xiao family's honor

152
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,530
to escort you, Old Madam Wu.

153
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,270
If those villains were to kidnap you

154
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,960
and distract General Wu,

155
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,120
causing him to miss opportunities
on the front lines,

156
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,150
the Northern Wastelanders

157
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,480
would take advantage of it
and attack again.

158
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,670
Then we'd become sinners of the country.

159
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,550
Mr. Xiao,

160
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,080
what's your plan now? Just tell me.

161
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,480
I trust the Xiao family completely.

162
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,360
The Power Gang poisoned the well.

163
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:59,790
Their goal is to force us out.

164
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,910
Outside the Sword Manor,

165
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,750
there must be countless traps
waiting for us.

166
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,320
But by agreement,

167
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,480
in 2 days,

168
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,790
we must escort Old Madam Wu

169
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,840
to meet with General Wu.

170
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,480
This cannot be delayed,

171
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,870
nor can we sit here waiting for death.

172
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,150
Father,

173
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,100
if some of us leave the Sword Manor first,

174
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:41,080
how long will the remaining water last?

175
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,720
If some of us can get out,

176
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,280
the remaining water

177
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,480
is enough for 20 days.

178
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,720
Twenty days…

179
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,010
Alright,

180
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,000
I understand.

181
00:11:58,550 --> 00:11:59,150
Everyone,

182
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:01,510
we still need to escort Old Madam Wu

183
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:03,480
to meet General Wu on time.

184
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:04,790
Only by doing this

185
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,390
can we break this deadlock

186
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,080
and gain time

187
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,480
for help from the other sects.

188
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,150
Only by working together

189
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:14,680
can we defeat the Power Gang

190
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,030
and lift the siege on the Xiao family.

191
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,300
But weapons show no mercy,

192
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:21,240
and the Power Gang is ruthless.

193
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,490
If we send Old Madam Wu out rashly,

194
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,150
wouldn't that risk her life?

195
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,810
Besides, in the martial world today,

196
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:31,890
how many people dare
to stand against the Power Gang?

197
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,450
Your plan is nothing

198
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,240
but wishful thinking.

199
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,720
We just fought
the Power Gang in the Sword Manor.

200
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,240
Have you already forgotten?

201
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,960
No matter how powerful the Power Gang is,

202
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,080
can they overpower
the entire martial world?

203
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,210
Moreover, everyone here
stands against the Power Gang.

204
00:12:48,390 --> 00:12:49,120
Old Madam Wu,

205
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,400
please rest assured. I will do my utmost

206
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,410
to ensure your safety.

207
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,630
I've heard Huishan
speak of this boy before.

208
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:01,750
He truly takes after
you and your wife the most.

209
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,510
Qiushui is right.

210
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:05,840
It's time for us

211
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,370
to discuss how to break out.

212
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,160
But the Power Gang
has surrounded the Sword Manor.

213
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,550
They'll surely be watching closely.

214
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:16,080
We cannot guarantee
everyone's safe escape.

215
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,730
Indeed. Forcing our way out
would only result in heavy casualties.

216
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,360
Besides, our only advantage now

217
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:25,390
is knowing their target

218
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,390
is Old Madam Wu.

219
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:31,120
Why don't we come up with a clever plan

220
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,200
to trick them?

221
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,550
We can have someone

222
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,950
impersonate Old Madam Wu

223
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,030
as a decoy

224
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,290
to distract the enemy.

225
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,670
To ensure Old Madam Wu's safe escape,

226
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,550
some of us must

227
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,600
divert the enemy's attention.

228
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,610
Then it's settled.

229
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,960
The rest of us will do everything possible

230
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:59,670
to ensure Old Madam Wu gets out safely.

231
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:03,790
But if someone must serve as a decoy

232
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,120
just so I can leave,

233
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,150
I'd feel terrible about it.

234
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,910
Old Madam Wu, don't worry.

235
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,310
I'll draw them away.

236
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Qiushui.

237
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,160
Mother, don't worry.

238
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,440
Yiren and the others are not around,

239
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,840
and I'm grown now.

240
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,270
It's time I do my part
for the Huanhua Sect.

241
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:15,600
Everyone, the Power Gang
has committed countless crimes.

242
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,670
Rather than waiting for death,

243
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,620
we might as well take the risk,

244
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,080
fight our way out,

245
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,190
get help from the martial world,

246
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,840
and destroy the gang!

247
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,120
Yes!

248
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,240
Xilou, you're injured,

249
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,250
so just stay here
in the Sword Manor this time.

250
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,090
The rest of us

251
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,790
will help Old Madam Wu,

252
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,890
Qiushui, and the others break out.

253
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:45,630
Everyone,
this journey is fraught with danger.

254
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,150
Please take care of yourselves.

255
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,520
I'll be waiting for your return

256
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,790
to share wine and tea with you.

257
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:56,310
-Rest assured, Xilou.
-Rest assured, Mr. Xiao.

258
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:11,790
Qiushui.

259
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,170
Mother.

260
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:19,440
There are many skilled fighters
outside the Sword Manor.

261
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,970
You must protect yourself.

262
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,320
Shan, don't worry.

263
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,600
Our son has grown up.

264
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,870
Since he has chosen
to take on this responsibility,

265
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,240
he must have thought it through.

266
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,910
Trust his judgment.

267
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,270
Children of the Xiao family

268
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:41,870
don't make empty promises
without confidence.

269
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,270
Father, Mother.

270
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:48,550
I haven't spent much time with you
since I came back this time.

271
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,280
Don't worry.

272
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,260
I'll take good care of myself.

273
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,910
Besides, Mother,

274
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,080
I haven't had enough of your noodles yet.

275
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,510
Take this.

276
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:07,440
Besides the Three Styles of Boldness,

277
00:17:07,550 --> 00:17:09,200
I also have this treasure bag.

278
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,859
It contains many mechanisms.

279
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
You must keep in mind how to use them.

280
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,640
Use them in the most devious way possible.

281
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:22,030
Yes, your mother is right.

282
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:25,310
Even I once…

283
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,569
fell for her tricks.

284
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:32,150
Neat trick. Neat trick.

285
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:34,680
Qiushui.

286
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,450
Earlier when we were drinking,

287
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,070
you said you've always
admired those swordsmen

288
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,480
who punish evil
and defend the weak with their swords.

289
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,070
But, son,

290
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,600
have you thought about this?

291
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,240
Everyone is made of flesh and blood,

292
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,490
naturally afraid of death.

293
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:58,270
So why, when it's about justice,

294
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,790
do those people no longer fear death?

295
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:07,480
It's because in this world,

296
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:11,830
there are things
more important than life itself.

297
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,640
Today,

298
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,920
so many friends are willing
to fight for our Xiao family,

299
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,440
risking injury or death.

300
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,480
Never forget their kindness.

301
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,480
Father, Mother,

302
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,610
I'll keep it in mind.

303
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,550
Once Old Madam Wu is safe,

304
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,310
I will seek help
from all sects in Jinzhong.

305
00:18:37,310 --> 00:18:40,030
Together we'll defeat the Power Gang.

306
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:46,830
Go now.

307
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:55,640
Take care. Take care of yourself.

308
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,400
Father, Mother.

309
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:06,510
Within 20 days,

310
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,490
I will seek help from all sects

311
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,960
and return to save the Sword Manor.

312
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,600

After breaking out of the Sword Manor,

349
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,910
we'll split into 4 teams.

350
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,900
Uncle Qu, Uncle Meng, and Uncle Tieyi

351
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,640
will lead the Dragon Team
to draw their fire,

352
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,040
giving the other 3 teams
a chance to escape.

353
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,930
Old Madam Wu will hide her identity
with a black veil.

354
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,790
Others will wear black robes

355
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,750
and split into 3 groups to escort her,

356
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,790
confusing the enemy

357
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,320
and dividing their forces.

358
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:52,790
Let's go!

359
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:11,150
[Let them go.]

360
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,770
[Take them down one by one.]

361
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,840
Buy as much time as possible.

362
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,900
Don't get exposed.

363
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:32,200
Give Old Madam Wu's team more time.

364
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,140
This way.

365
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,680
Tang Fang, Feng Lang,

366
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,830
you'll protect Old Madam Wu
with the Phoenix Team

367
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,260
and break through from the eastern woods.

368
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:00,910
Remember,

369
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,380
keep your gas masks on.

370
00:23:02,470 --> 00:23:04,180
You'll pass through
a forest with toxic miasma,

371
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,180
which will slow down the Power Gang.

372
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:06,800
Besides,

373
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:08,450
they're likely to believe Old Madam Wu

374
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:09,930
would stay with Mr. Zhang.

375
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,600
You'll be safer this way.

376
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,370
The miasma forest is ahead.

377
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,300
Put on the masks.

378
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,280
Let's go.

379
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:43,770
Uncle Kang and I will lure

380
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:46,190
the Power Gang deeper into the forest.

381
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,510
They're catching up!

382
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,550
Go ahead with Old Madam Wu.

383
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,240
-Yes.
-Yes.

384
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,030
[In this case,]

385
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,510
[I'll lure all of you here.]

386
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:39,980
Go!

387
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,210
Tang Rou, Yuhan, Zuoqiu,

388
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,280
proceed with caution

389
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,960
and find a chance to head up the mountain.

390
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,510
The Power Gang won't expect anyone

391
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,310
to go in the opposite direction.

392
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,590
Go.

393
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:16,970
Leave Old Madam Wu behind,

394
00:25:17,270 --> 00:25:18,730
and I'll spare your lives.

395
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:25,440
It's you.

396
00:25:26,590 --> 00:25:27,520
One word for you:

397
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,880
stupid.

398
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:32,030
How dare you fool me? I'll kill you.

399
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,510
I doubt it.

400
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:35,320
Attack!

401
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:25,750
No!

402
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,220
G-Go.

403
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,960
Go!

404
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,640
Go.

405
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,680
Go!

406
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,030
Brothers,

407
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,350
stop fighting!

408
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:51,680
Let's go!

409
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,510
Let's go.

410
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:54,830
Let's go.

411
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,480
Third Young Master, go!

412
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,940
Let's go together!

413
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,590
Come on, get up!

414
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:06,640
The Xiao family once protected me.

415
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,920
Today, I'm repaying that debt.

416
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,310
Stop talking and go!

417
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,960
Go!

418
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:19,200
Third Young Master, go!

419
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,200
Kong Yangqin!

420
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:42,600
You're nothing compared to Fu Tianyi.

421
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,030
You can't kill me.

422
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,920
You can't kill me!

423
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:25,320
This thing from Xiao Qiushui
is quite useful.

424
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,860
What are these?

425
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:30,690
They protect you from the miasma.
Take them.

426
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:32,940
One each. Safety first. Put them on.

427
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:45,790
Protect Old Madam Wu.

428
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,450
-Yes!
-Yes!

429
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,500
The target isn't here. Retreat.

430
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:51,890
What's going on?

431
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:52,790
Where is Old Madam Wu?

432
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,790
I don't know either.

433
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,390
Third Young Master asked me
to dress like this.

434
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:57,370
Father, Mother,

435
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:59,230
although Mr. Qiu is dead,

436
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,440
the Power Gang has always been cunning,

437
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,550
with spies everywhere
and endless schemes.

438
00:30:03,550 --> 00:30:05,210
To ensure nothing goes wrong,

439
00:30:05,830 --> 00:30:07,350
I have to change the plan
at the last minute

440
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,350
to throw them off.

441
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:13,830
You'll disguise yourself as Old Madam Wu
and leave with Feng Lang.

442
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:15,230
Should I inform Mr. Feng?

443
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,230
No need.

444
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,130
Understood.

445
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:20,570
Then what about the real Old Madam Wu?

446
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,850
Mother, I have another plan for her.

447
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:27,710
Why did Xiao Qiushui
suddenly change the plan?

448
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,200
Where is Old Madam Wu?

449
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,780
Find Xiao Qiushui, and we'll know.

450
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,140
Hurry back to the Sword Manor.

451
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:52,420
Why on earth did you come
to the Xiao Residence?

452
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,910
Xiao Qiushui once helped me.

453
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,030
It's only right that I help him

454
00:30:57,030 --> 00:30:58,090
fight his enemies.

455
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,640
But since you came out,

456
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,750
you don't seem
all that concerned about his safety.

457
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,680
Compared to him,

458
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:07,720
you care more
about Madam Wu's whereabouts.

459
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,800
That doesn't seem right.

460
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:12,750
Miss Tang,

461
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,310
are you making such assumptions

462
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:17,570
because you came with ulterior motives?

463
00:31:23,070 --> 00:31:25,070
Then why did you save me just now?

464
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:28,050
It was nothing. No particular reason.

465
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,680
Keep running.

466
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,950
Why did you stop running?

467
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,660
I'll break your bones

468
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,280
and make them into plectrums for my qin.
What do you think?

469
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,590
Fine.

470
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:09,440
I won't run anymore.

471
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,210
You're afraid to die, aren't you?

472
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:15,880
Not really.

473
00:32:18,490 --> 00:32:20,020
I'll send you to your death.

474
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,640
Kill him.

475
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,720
-Yes!
-Yes!

476
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,040
You slaughtered disciples
of the Xiao family.

477
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,230
Take your qin

478
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,710
and play it on your way to hell.

479
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,350
This little trick of yours

480
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:43,310
will only cost you your life.

481
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,640
It's just the appetizer.

482
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,870
Tell me where Old Madam Wu is.

483
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:49,920
Or else

484
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:52,400
I'll feed you to my venomous bugs.

485
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:56,260
[Hua Gufen, the Poison Demon,]

486
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,740
[this place will be where you die.]

487
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:37,710
Tang Rou,

488
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,520
you're skilled
with hidden weapons and mechanisms.

489
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,909
This time, I need you to do me a favor.

490
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:47,199
Fine. What do you want me to do?

491
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,400
Big Brother, your recent actions

492
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,730
have been rather hard to understand.

493
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:56,090
Am I right?

494
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,190
[Fu Tianyi is dead,
and the Xiao family is besieged.]

495
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,260
[Who knows where the story will go next?]

496
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:07,030
[I'd better take precautions.]

497
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:18,690
Are you alright?

498
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:23,630
I'm fine.

499
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,440
What about the other guards?

500
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,460
Y-You've been poisoned
by Hua Gufen's bugs.

501
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,650
Let me treat you.

502
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:05,880
No need.

503
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:11,150
Xueyu gave me some detoxifying pills.

504
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,490
I'll just take one later.

505
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,550
What about Old Madam Wu and Tang Rou?

506
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:21,490
Old Madam Wu and the others

507
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,590
should be safe now.

508
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:24,590
Tang Rou,

509
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,590
take Old Madam Wu and Mr. Zhang

510
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,960
to the cliff at the back of the mountain

511
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:29,160
and leave from there.

512
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,880
How are we supposed to cross that cliff?

513
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,360
Don't worry. I have a way.

514
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,340
This device from Qiushui is amazing.

515
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,470
It can actually fly.

516
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,050
Old Madam Wu.

517
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,570
Old Madam Wu,

518
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,520
are you alright?

519
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,320
I am fine.

520
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,900
Mr. Xiao's plan is brilliant.

521
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:01,160
Let's take Old Madam Wu
to take a rest now.

522
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:02,920
Okay.

523
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,030
I'm glad Old Madam Wu is safe.

524
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,210
But Mr. Xiao,

525
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,760
why did you change the plan
at the last minute?

526
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,680
In the martial world,

527
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:19,830
the Power Gang's spies are everywhere.

528
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:22,020
Their identities are hidden,

529
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,770
and they're too cunning to guard against.

530
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,590
I couldn't risk Old Madam Wu's life,

531
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:32,430
so I changed the plan at the last moment.

532
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,480
It seems my parents

533
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:46,960
and uncles

534
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,290
have safely retreated to the Sword Manor.

535
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,020
It's getting late.

536
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,000
We need to join General Wu's troops

537
00:37:56,510 --> 00:37:57,640
as soon as possible.

538
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,450
Let's go.

539
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,430
Greetings, Red Phoenix.

540
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,510
You work for the Sword King?

541
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,110
Yes.

542
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:22,670
Who allowed you
to meddle in Master's affairs?

543
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,630
Have you seen where Old Madam Wu went?

544
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,760
My master only ordered us
to watch the Xiao family.

545
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,880
We never went inside.

546
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,140
How would we know
where Old Madam Wu went?

547
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,280
I see.

548
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:54,370
[The Sword King's men are
also looking for Old Madam Wu.]

549
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,100
[I must report this to Master.]

550
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,150
These places

551
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,590
have all been infiltrated
by the Power Gang.

552
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,940
After Old Madam Wu arrives,

553
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,070
she'll need to rest.

554
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:40,760
Tang Fang, go wait outside town.

555
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,670
If you meet Old Madam Wu,

556
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,340
give her a heads-up first.

557
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:46,910
I'll go to Tongfu Inn

558
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:48,940
to check out the situation there.

559
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,900
Alright, be careful.

560
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:05,230
[Tongfu Inn]

561
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,790
Sirs, will you be dining or staying?

562
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,700
Have the people from the west arrived?

563
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,650
You are…

564
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,760
No one has come,

565
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,090
but there's a letter
I was told to deliver.

566
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,870
[To Xiao Xilou]

567
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:35,210
[Lingliang Town is
crawling with the Power Gang's men.]

568
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:35,490
[Old Madam Wu is unsafe there.]

569
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:35,770
[Wait for our smoke signal
in the Shili Forest in the southwest.]

570
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,480
[We'll pick Old Madam Wu up.
—The Wu family's guards.]

571
00:40:45,190 --> 00:40:45,880
Thanks.

572
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,160
Tomorrow afternoon,

573
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:56,280
we'll meet at a different location.

574
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:59,800
Do Old Madam Wu and the others
know the new place?

575
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,730
They should have

576
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,660
another way to pass the message along.

577
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:07,560
No time to waste.

578
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,080
Let's go.

579
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,880
Make way! Make way! Make way!

580
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:15,910
Any findings?

581
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:16,670
No.

582
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,320
Guard every exit of the town.

583
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,780
No one is allowed to leave.

584
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,470
Yes!

585
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:28,280
What do you plan to do next?

586
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,280
Let's go.
