1
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,789
Look.

2
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,870
This paper was torn in half.

3
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,680
I suspect

4
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,490
Uncle Deng wanted
to leave you a message.

5
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:57,479
Could it be

6
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,050
Father was trying to write something?

7
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,880
I discovered earlier

8
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:06,590
that Father was hiding something
about Baicao Valley.

9
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:08,320
But no matter how I pressed him,

10
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,150
he never told me.

11
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,310
Maybe

12
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,000
Father finally came around

13
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,200
and wanted to tell us the truth.

14
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,430
Liu Suifeng!

15
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,870
If he killed Uncle Deng,

16
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,710
no matter where he hides,

17
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,280
I'll avenge your father.

18
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,090
Big Brother,

19
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:41,710
are you saying

20
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,520
we can't be sure it was him?

21
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,320
My father had no other enemies.

22
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,170
Aside from the Power Gang,

23
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,360
aside from Liu Suifeng,

24
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,150
who else would have been so ruthless?

25
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,800
Yulan.

26
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,470
Think carefully.

27
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,810
Is there anything else that feels off?

28
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:39,400
Ten o'clock in the evening.

29
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,840
Liu Suifeng.

30
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,610
Last night I came to the study
to see Father

31
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,840
and saw Liu Suifeng coming out.

32
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,310
No,

33
00:03:48,590 --> 00:03:49,590
that's not right.

34
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,000
I came to see Father at midnight.

35
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,120
Yulan, are you mistaken?

36
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,190
No.

37
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,240
It was 10 PM.

38
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,240
That means…

39
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,640
someone else must've been here.

40
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,920
How long has your father been unconscious?

41
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:34,960
Until recently,
he could stay lucid for about two hours.

42
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:38,680
But the past two days,
he's been in a deep sleep.

43
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,720
Given his condition,
he won't last half a month.

44
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:44,800
I know a special treatment,

45
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,070
but it has a 50% chance of failure.

46
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,120
If it fails,

47
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,120
your father won't last seven days.

48
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,050
Whether to try it or not,

49
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,870
consider carefully.

50
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,430
Move aside. Let me in.

51
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:07,040
Go away!

52
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,360
What is it?

53
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,120
Old Madam Tang heard
the Herbal King is here

54
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,160
and specially sent me
to deliver the Nourishment Soup

55
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,360
to aid his treatment.

56
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,130
Please let me through.

57
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,270
That's thoughtful of Old Madam Tang.

58
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,530
But the Herbal King is
only here as a guest

59
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:30,160
to discuss poison techniques
with my father.

60
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:33,510
He doesn't need this soup for now.

61
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,980
Who would dare poison the soup
in the Old Madam Tang's name?

62
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,870
You don't need to be so wary.

63
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,270
Miss,

64
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:46,970
it's a misunderstanding.

65
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:48,510
Miss,

66
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,310
Master is indeed in good health.

67
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
If it were a common tonic,

68
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,040
I'd just accept it.

69
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,120
But such a potent life-saving medicine

70
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:01,440
isn't appropriate.

71
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,830
Fine.

72
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,870
Master rarely appears in public,

73
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:10,070
so Old Madam Tang thought he was ill.

74
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:13,270
She said
if he can't manage the Tang Sect anymore,

75
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:15,200
he should make arrangements soon.

76
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:18,600
But I reassured her

77
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,880
that Master is only busy.

78
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,020
He'll certainly attend
the mid-month meeting,

79
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:25,920
won't he?

80
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,630
Of course he will.

81
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,240
You may go.

82
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,380
There's no escape either way.

83
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,870
Herbal King,

84
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,909
please do whatever is needed
to save my father.

85
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:02,470
All right.

86
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,350
I'll make preparations.

87
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:24,920
Yuhan.

88
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,080
There's something in Uncle Deng's mouth.

89
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,480
Tieyi?

90
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,120
Could it be the Constable Tieyi?

91
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,710
Uncle Tieyi was a righteous man.

92
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:52,320
He was my father's dearest friend.

93
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,730
When the Sword Manor was under siege,

94
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,130
he sacrificed his life to help us.

95
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:00,200
Could he still be alive?

96
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,520
Let's find him and get answers.

97
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,530
After the fall of the Sword Manor,

98
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,190
his body was never found.

99
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,960
Several corpses were burned
beyond recognition.

100
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,900
We can't be sure if one was his.

101
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,750
Everyone assumes he died in battle
at the Sword Manor.

102
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:22,170
But with so many people there,

103
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:23,960
why was his body

104
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,510
the only body missing?

105
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:29,790
My father did hide something

106
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,960
about what happened in Baicao Valley.

107
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,470
But

108
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,990
what does that have to do
with Constable Tieyi?

109
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,720
I'm not sure yet.

110
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,200
But I'm certain

111
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,050
that someone is trying

112
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,750
to stop us
from digging further into the person

113
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,810
with the Marrow-Disrupting Finger.

114
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:53,200
Yuhan,

115
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
if it weren't for my investigation,

116
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,270
Uncle Deng

117
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,490
might not have ended up like this.

118
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,320
I'm sorry.

119
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,120
Big Brother,

120
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,650
this isn't your fault.

121
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,010
We have to avenge

122
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,960
the Huanhua Sect

123
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,640
and the Hailin Sect.

124
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,980
This villain is utterly vicious.

125
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,280
If we can't catch him,

126
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,960
I fear our families

127
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,750
won't be his last victims.

128
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:43,360
Big Brother,

129
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,360
don't worry.

130
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,390
I'll never let this break me

131
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:52,080
or bow to that murderer.

132
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:56,110
We must find that scourge
of the martial world.

133
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,850
Once I've buried my father
and fellow disciples,

134
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,360
I'll come to help you
hunt down the killer.

135
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:09,630
Yuhan,

136
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:11,730
can you handle this alone?

137
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:14,150
All I want now

138
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:19,320
is to make the killer pay with his life.

139
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,630
Good.

140
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,910
I'll definitely find him.

141
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,640
Big Brother,

142
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,600
be careful.

143
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:20,730
Father.

144
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,010
Father!

145
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:25,610
Father!

146
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,510
Father.

147
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,790
I've done everything I could.

148
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:38,390
Miss,

149
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,890
my condolences.

150
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,840
I know you have great skills,

151
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:54,070
unmatched in both medicine and poison.

152
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,950
You treat illness and save lives

153
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,210
with unconventional methods.

154
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:00,970
Herbal King,

155
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,010
please think of another way

156
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,240
to save my father.

157
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:06,590
Please get up.

158
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,550
Please get up.

159
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,200
Please don't do this.

160
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,030
There is

161
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,800
another method.

162
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,390
But for you,

163
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,550
it's far too dangerous.

164
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,390
For me?

165
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,540
Whatever it takes,

166
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,240
as long as it can save my father,

167
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,300
I'm willing to try.

168
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:34,000
It's a method
of fighting poison with poison.

169
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,910
Someone must first
take my specially prepared poison

170
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,960
and then transfer
internal energy to the patient.

171
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,630
Two poisons will clash
until one fades.

172
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,870
It might bring your father
back from the brink.

173
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,310
But with the slightest mistake,

174
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,570
not only will your father die,

175
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:57,600
but your own life may be lost too.

176
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,690
Please, teach me this method.

177
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,580
No matter what,

178
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,440
I must save my father.

179
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,790
Then I'll grant your filial wish.

180
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:49,440
Miss,

181
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:52,730
let's stop here for today.

182
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,270
We mustn't rush things.

183
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,150
We'll raise the dosage
when treatment begins.

184
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:35,600
Father.

185
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:47,080
Fang.

186
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:50,910
I…

187
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:55,800
have become a burden to you.

188
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:58,090
As long as you're safe, Father,

189
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,480
I'll do anything.

190
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,680
Who would go so far
as to slaughter the Deng family?

191
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,510
We don't know yet.

192
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:15,720
But Big Brother is looking into it.

193
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,510
I believe he'll uncover the truth.

194
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,680
Once we find the killer,

195
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,680
we'll help Yuhan avenge his family.

196
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,740
Where is Yuhan now?

197
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,839
He's in mourning at home.

198
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,680
But I've already written to him.

199
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,920
If he needs us,

200
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,630
we'll go to him immediately.

201
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:30,680
Then let's ask around the martial world

202
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,680
to see if there are any clues.

203
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,280
All right.

204
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:32,960
Let's go.

205
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,480
They say a heroine came to town,
going everywhere

206
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,920
to treat the disaster victims.

207
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,070
That must be you.

208
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,030
I just did what I could.

209
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:48,920
Kaiyan,

210
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:51,170
why have you come so late to see me?

211
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,540
There's been no word of Yiren lately.

212
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,880
I wonder how he's doing.

213
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:03,270
How's it possible that he's colluded
with the Northern Wastelanders

214
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:05,130
and openly betrayed the country?

215
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,150
I've also sent men to ask around,

216
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:11,070
but there is still no word of him.

217
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,560
I thought of going to find him

218
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:18,550
and bring him back to explain himself.

219
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,920
But I couldn't stop worrying about you.

220
00:18:28,110 --> 00:18:29,640
Kaiyan, you worry too much.

221
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,510
I'm fine here.

222
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,680
How could I not worry?

223
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,920
If anything happened to you,

224
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:41,720
how would I face

225
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:43,550
Father and Mother in heaven?

226
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:47,110
When our parents took you in,

227
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:50,070
I saw you as my own sister.

228
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,350
Of course…

229
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,720
sometimes not just as a sister.

230
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:02,830
Kaiyan,

231
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,840
why say this all of a sudden?

232
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,000
I know

233
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,200
you once

234
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:17,440
admired Yiren.

235
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:22,960
I only see him as my elder brother.

236
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,310
And I see you

237
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,070
the same way.

238
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:28,590
I also know

239
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,200
Yiren put you through a lot that day.

240
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,200
There's no need to bring up the past.

241
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,600
I'm part of the Xiao family.

242
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,310
When the family was in trouble,

243
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,710
it was my duty to stand up.

244
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,680
Now,

245
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:47,510
we're the only Xiaos left.

246
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,680
So no matter what,

247
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,280
you'll always be my brother.

248
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,310
I heard that the traitor escaped here.

249
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:06,240
We must catch him if we run into him.

250
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,480
The eldest son of the Xiao family colluded
with the Northern Wastelanders.

251
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,400
Who is this person in black?

252
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:14,030
He made me end up like this.

253
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,590
I have to find out who he is

254
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,960
to clear my name.

255
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,310
Xiaoyi?

256
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,350
Yiren.

257
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,310
Why are you here?

258
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,750
I searched every town along the way.

259
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,000
I finally found you.

260
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:39,790
Yiren,

261
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,250
come back with me, will you?

262
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,680
Let's go back
and explain everything to everyone.

263
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,160
No.

264
00:20:46,350 --> 00:20:48,070
Until I find the one who framed me,

265
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,070
I won't return.

266
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,510
Please don't leave.

267
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:56,200
It took me so long to find you.

268
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,270
If you go now, I don't know

269
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,670
when I can find you again.

270
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,280
Why are you still looking for me?

271
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,030
I'm not who I used to be.

272
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,270
Everyone thinks I've colluded
with the Northern Wastelanders

273
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,270
and that I'm a disgrace
to the martial world.

274
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,920
I'm like a rat in the street now—

275
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,030
everyone despises me.

276
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,920
I don't care.

277
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,570
I don't care what happened

278
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,510
or what anyone says.

279
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,640
I only believe in you.

280
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:31,530
Come on.

281
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,340
What if we really run into him?

282
00:21:34,070 --> 00:21:35,870
This martial world is a mess now.

283
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,680
Even the Deng family,
who always kept to themselves,

284
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,510
was wiped out by the Power Gang

285
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,550
for some unknown reason.

286
00:21:42,310 --> 00:21:43,270
All the dishes are here.

287
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,030
Did you hear?

288
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,510
The Fei family,
one of the Three Mystical Families—

289
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:47,920
its family leader, Mr. Fei,

290
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,880
suddenly announced he'd withdraw
from the martial world in three days.

291
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,750
Withdraw?

292
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:53,400
Yes.

293
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:56,750
By the rules of the martial world,

294
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:58,010
after the withdrawal,

295
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:01,070
one will no longer be involved
in martial world affairs.

296
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,680
All their secrets
will be taken to the grave.

297
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,600
I need to get there quickly.

298
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,610
Take your medicine.

299
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,320
The treasures brought back
from Nantian Abyss

300
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:01,940
have all been tallied.

301
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,740
As you instructed,

302
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,240
90% has been exchanged
for food and warm clothing.

303
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:10,340
The remaining 10% has been sent
to various sects

304
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,480
and the families of those
who died in battle.

305
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,110
Everything's already
loaded onto the boats.

306
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,140
They can set out tomorrow.

307
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:22,750
Good.

308
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,000
I'll head to the capital tomorrow.

309
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,120
I don't want you to go.

310
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:40,960
Shirong,

311
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,540
you're being childish again.

312
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,240
Every time…

313
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,960
every time you return from the palace,

314
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,400
your health gets worse.

315
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,710
Don't think I don't know what's happening.

316
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,560
He just wants to control you

317
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,310
and torture you slowly.

318
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,650
But for what we want to achieve…

319
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,960
I can endure it.

320
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,350
How long do you have to
keep enduring like this?

321
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:31,240
Since you know,

322
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,440
Shirong,

323
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:35,920
why don't you

324
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,680
let me finish what I need to do?

325
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,270
Once he gets what he wants,

326
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,690
he won't be restless every day.

327
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,590
Suspicion has no end.

328
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,240
Even if you think for him in everything,

329
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,110
he still distrusts you.

330
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,830
He does.

331
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,210
But what does it matter?

332
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:09,480
I do what I do only for what I believe in.

333
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,880
As long as the country prospers
and the people live in peace,

334
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,720
nothing else matters.

335
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,590
So you don't even

336
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:28,990
care about your own life?

337
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,250
This trip to the capital

338
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,920
may be very dangerous.

339
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,200
Let me go with you.

340
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,410
Don't worry.

341
00:25:58,590 --> 00:26:02,200
As long as the court needs me,

342
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,790
they have to keep me alive.

343
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:08,550
Shirong,

344
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,070
don't worry.

345
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,440
I'll return safely this time.

346
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,140
Take your medicine first.

347
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,920
Are you here for the young master's
coming-of-age ceremony?

348
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,380
Do you have an invitation?

349
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:57,790
I'm here on behalf of Prince Liang Dou,
the Glow Achiever,

350
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:00,030
to deliver a letter
to the master of the Fei family.

351
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:01,160
Please announce me.

352
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,520
One moment, sir.

353
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,480
Sir,

354
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:11,710
you can't enter without an invitation.

355
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,310
I'd like to see

356
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,920
what scheme you're plotting this time.

357
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:33,400
Thank you, Mr. Xiao.

358
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,640
I'm aware of Prince Liang's investigation.

359
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,160
Since you've come so far with this letter,

360
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,480
please stay and rest for a few days.

361
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,410
Thank you, Mr. Fei.

362
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,200
I came here

363
00:27:45,310 --> 00:27:46,570
with another request.

364
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:47,750
What is it?

365
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,510
As long as I can help,

366
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,270
and it doesn't go against martial honor,

367
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,350
I will certainly assist you.

368
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,350
Mr. Fei,

369
00:27:57,590 --> 00:28:01,070
have you ever practiced a technique
called the Marrow-Disrupting Finger?

370
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:04,590
So you came for that too.

371
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:07,200
That technique causes great harm.

372
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,940
It should have been eradicated long ago.

373
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:13,000
Forgive me, but I cannot teach it to you.

374
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:14,630
Mr. Fei, you misunderstood.

375
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,310
I don't wish to learn it.

376
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,110
I just want you to use it

377
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,200
to confirm my parents' cause of death.

378
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,000
Your parents?

379
00:28:26,110 --> 00:28:27,160
Xiao Xilou

380
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,960
and Sun Huishan.

381
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,030
I am Xiao Qiushui.

382
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:37,440
I heard

383
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:41,310
you're friends
with Deng Qingfeng's son, Deng Yuhan.

384
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,070
Did you slaughter the Deng family

385
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:47,480
to investigate
the Marrow-Disrupting Finger?

386
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,880
I'd never have done that.

387
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:52,040
Deng Yuhan is my sworn brother.

388
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,880
How could I have harmed his family?

389
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:58,310
Someone must have framed me.

390
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,680
If you doubt me because of this,

391
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,800
you've fallen into their trap.

392
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,310
How am I supposed to believe you?

393
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,720
Mr. Fei, you don't have to believe me.

394
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,980
But if I were sinister,

395
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:12,330
why would Mr. Liang Dou

396
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:15,750
have entrusted me with this letter?

397
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,920
You have a point.

398
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:21,380
Mr. Liang's martial skills are formidable.

399
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:23,920
You couldn't have stolen it from him.

400
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:24,920
Forget it.

401
00:29:25,510 --> 00:29:28,480
Tomorrow, my eldest grandson
will have his coming-of-age ceremony,

402
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,920
and I'll withdraw from the martial world.

403
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,680
I don't want any trouble before then.

404
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,070
After tomorrow,

405
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,110
once I've laid down my burden,

406
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:39,920
I'll try it for you.

407
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,330
Thank you, Mr. Fei.

408
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,240
While everyone is gathered
in the ancestral hall,

409
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,110
search the place in secret.

410
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,310
I don't believe
the Thousand-Faces Mask was destroyed.

411
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:52,970
-Yes.
-Yes.

412
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,830
Mr. Fei.

413
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:41,070
Today is the day
for my grandson's coming-of-age ceremony

414
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:44,590
and the day the Fei family withdraws

415
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,960
from the martial world.

416
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,960
From this day on,

417
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:52,960
my descendants will only engage
in business and scholarly pursuits

418
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,820
and stay out of the martial world.

419
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,510
Stay out of martial world affairs?

420
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,160
Are they withdrawing
from the martial world?

421
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,310
Chengqing

422
00:30:59,510 --> 00:31:02,070
has always disliked
martial arts since childhood.

423
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,640
He only loves practical learning.

424
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:07,570
He's most suitable to be the family head.

425
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,000
But

426
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,310
all of you here
have close ties with my family—

427
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:17,070
some are friends, some are foes.

428
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:20,270
I've invited you here today

429
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,960
to wipe the slate clean.

430
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,270
It's not that easy.

431
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:26,840
Dream on!

432
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,000
To wipe the slate clean?

433
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,960
Withdrawing from the martial world?

434
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,720
Yes.

435
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,880
What a shame.

436
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,680
The giant is falling,

437
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,310
and the vultures can't wait
to drink its blood.

438
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,270
Mr. Fei,

439
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,070
your son Fei Danfeng

440
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,110
once severed my brother's arm.

441
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:49,040
If you want to wipe the slate clean,

442
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:52,310
you should offer some unique techniques
as compensation.

443
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,640
Yes, that's right.

444
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,590
Mr. Fei,

445
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,480
hand over the Thousand-Faces Mask now!

446
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:56,680
Yes!

447
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,830
-Yes, hand it over!
-Hand it over!

448
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,070
-Hand it over!
-Hand it over!

449
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:02,870
Grandfather.

450
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,960
What should we do?

451
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:11,160
So you're all
after the Thousand-Faces Mask.

452
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:14,310
Then I'll tell you its whereabouts.

453
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,830
Five years ago,

454
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,510
my eldest son, Danfeng,
took it to carry out imperial orders

455
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,280
but was brutally assassinated.

456
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,240
His body was never found.

457
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,290
That item was destroyed that very night.

458
00:32:30,550 --> 00:32:33,070
Only a scrap of charred skin remained.

459
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:35,960
I buried it in the ancestral tomb.

460
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:36,750
You...

461
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,310
How is that possible?

462
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,510
That's nonsense.

463
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,510
Yeah.

464
00:32:42,070 --> 00:32:43,270
You must hand it over.

465
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:44,970
How could it have been burned?

466
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:48,680
To keep the Fei family
from sinking deeper into misery,

467
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:52,310
I swore an oath that day:

468
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,000
anyone in the Fei family

469
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:58,790
who dares to secretly use
the Thousand-Faces Mask

470
00:32:59,270 --> 00:33:01,070
will have their martial arts crippled

471
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,870
and be banished from the family.

472
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:06,000
No way.

473
00:33:06,030 --> 00:33:07,360
He really destroyed it?

474
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,670
With so many people here,

475
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,110
you still dare

476
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,840
to tell such an outrageous lie!

477
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,720
Hand over the Thousand-Faces Mask.

478
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,920
We won't make things difficult for you.

479
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:25,030
You two family traitors!

480
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:27,040
You broke the family rules,

481
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,550
secretly using the Thousand-Faces Mask

482
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:29,680
without scruple.

483
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,310
I already cast you out.

484
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,070
How dare you show up here today?

485
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,370
If you had taught us
this secret technique earlier,

486
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,720
we wouldn't have had to
kill so many people.

487
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,440
How many times have I told you?

488
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,890
That thing is not in my possession!

489
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,720
You two, get out of here now!

490
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:50,790
I didn't expect this.

491
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:53,210
Keeping it to yourself—

492
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:55,150
what kind of withdrawal is this?

493
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,960
Better to destroy it here and now,

494
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,030
with everyone as witness.

495
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,430
-That's right. Hand it over!
-Hand it over!

496
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,550
-Hand it over!
-Hand it over!

497
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:04,510
-Hand it over!
-Hand it over!

498
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,570
You must have it hidden. Hand it over!

499
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,590
Enough!

500
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:16,110
I've already withdrawn
from the martial world,

501
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,230
yet you still push me so hard.

502
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:19,960
Fine.

503
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:23,320
Even if it breaks the rules
of withdrawal today,

504
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,760
I'll fight you to the end.

505
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,010
Come on then.

506
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,820
Who will be the first challenger?

507
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,110
Grandfather!

508
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:29,800
He's already struggling
against two juniors.

509
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:30,770
It seems...

510
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:49,710
Is it him?
Xiao Qiushui from the Xiao family?

511
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,840
-Yes.
-Why is he here?

512
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:51,320
Why is he here?

513
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,250
What's going on?

514
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,490
You're an outsider. Why are you
meddling in our family affairs?

515
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,070
What I can't stand most

516
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:25,930
is bullying the old and the young.

517
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,550
So today, I must interfere.

518
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:32,800
Xiao Qiushui.

519
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:36,800
Better mind your own family affairs.

520
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:39,920
Your eldest brother colluded
with the Northern Wastelanders.

521
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,190
As his brother,

522
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,510
how dare you interfere
in the matters of Daxi's martial world?

523
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,360
What nonsense are you talking about?

524
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,840
You just slaughtered the Deng family,

525
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,320
and now you're here
to cause trouble again.

526
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,320
We outnumber you.

527
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,810
If you dare make a move,

528
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,840
you won't walk away unscathed!

529
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,880
-That's right!
-Yes, that's right.

530
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,030
You'll regret it!

531
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:56,870
That's right.

532
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:57,480
Exactly!

533
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,920
Mind your own business!

534
00:36:58,920 --> 00:36:59,670
Step aside!

535
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,510
-Move away!
-Yes, move!

536
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,840
-Move!
-Step aside now!

537
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,480
I have questions for Mr. Fei.

538
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,320
So I must protect him.

539
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:11,050
How about this, everyone?

540
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:12,670
Let's make a bet.

541
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,280
If you win,

542
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:19,510
I'll no longer interfere in this matter.

543
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:24,920
And if we refuse?

544
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,920
Then your lives are at stake.

545
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,300
What's the bet?

546
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,710
If anyone here

547
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,670
can pull the sword

548
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:01,280
completely out of the stone,

549
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,630
I'll never meddle in this again.

550
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:06,150
But if you can't,

551
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,680
you'll have to

552
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,030
leave the Fei family alone.

553
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,480
And you two must also
give Mr. Fei the antidote.

554
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:14,680
Brother,

555
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,570
don't agree to this.

556
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,510
This guy's internal energy is immense.

557
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:20,570
It might be a trick.

558
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,920
It's just a sword.

559
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,210
Let's give it a try.

560
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,510
Fine.

561
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:26,840
We accept.

562
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,120
If anyone goes back on this bet,
the martial world will be after them!

563
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,360
My two rebellious children—

564
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,840
one has mastered
the Sky-Supporting Technique,

565
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,110
with limitless palm strength;

566
00:38:44,110 --> 00:38:45,550
the other has mastered
the Transformation Technique,

567
00:38:45,550 --> 00:38:46,840
making heavy objects feel light.

568
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,880
What if they actually win?

569
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,150
They won't.

570
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:22,480
Xiao Qiushui, you never said

571
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:24,960
we couldn't pull it out together.

572
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:28,320
I said you need
to pull the sword out of the stone.

573
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,190
But there's still stone on the sword.

574
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:33,320
Yes, the stone's still clinging to it.

575
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:07,720
The smaller the stone,
the harder it is to shatter.

576
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:10,120
With your internal energy,

577
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,690
you'll never get it out.

578
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,110
So, do you admit defeat now?

579
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,330
We admit it.

580
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,310
The antidote.

581
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,510
Grandfather.

582
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:44,500
The bet is settled.

583
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,840
From now on, the Fei family is
not to be messed with again.

584
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:52,190
Guys, please see yourselves out.

585
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:54,670
We came for nothing. Let's go.

586
00:40:54,670 --> 00:40:57,070
What a pity about the Thousand-Faces Mask.

587
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,850
We pressured him this much,

588
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,510
yet he still says he doesn't have it.

589
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:02,770
It must really be gone.

590
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:03,810
Let's go.

591
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,190
Master.

592
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,320
Master.

593
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:09,190
Master.

594
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,320
The ancestral tomb has been dug up!
