1
00:01:44,789 --> 00:01:46,320
The situation is critical.

2
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,440
I'll get straight to the point.

3
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:49,450
Third Brother,

4
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,220
did you secretly practice
the Voidheart Codex?

5
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,000
So that's what

6
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,110
you're here to ask.

7
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,400
Rumor has it that

8
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,550
you have the Hero Command Token.

9
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:15,280
That day at the Golden Summit,

10
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,000
the Hero Command Token you gave Zhichen

11
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,750
is only a map,

12
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,470
and not the Voidheart Codex.

13
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,430
Could it be...

14
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,240
you took it away?

15
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,310
You lost all your martial skills,

16
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,440
but suddenly you have internal energy.

17
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,960
I thought it was strange.

18
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,120
And that day on the Golden Summit,
Zhao Shirong said

19
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,650
you took the Infinite Pill.

20
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,750
Is that true?

21
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:38,880
That's right.

22
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,290
I accidentally got
the elixir from Shao Liulei.

23
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,360
As for the Hero Command Token,

24
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,680
I didn't know

25
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,750
it was hidden in Mr. Zhang's dagger.

26
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,630
You heard it.

27
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,680
Li Chenzhou also once mentioned the origin
of the Hero Command Token.

28
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,360
There was

29
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,280
no Voidheart Codex.

30
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,520
But Qiushui,

31
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,120
you know what kind of person
Li Chenzhou is.

32
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,680
That man is extremely cunning.

33
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,140
Can we believe what he say?

34
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:08,750
What Yiren means is

35
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,590
if you practiced the Voidheart Codex,

36
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:13,360
just tell us.

37
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,900
This will give us hope to revive
the Xiao family.

38
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:17,960
Wushang,

39
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,470
you trust me too?

40
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,680
If I really practiced the Voidheart Codex,

41
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,880
how could Li Chenzhou

42
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:28,890
have suppressed me at the Golden Summit?

43
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,280
How could I have watched

44
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,030
Zhu the Great King

45
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,120
use fake elixirs to deceive
the whole martial world.

46
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,190
What do you mean?

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,910
Are you blaming me?

48
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,680
What did I steal the pill for?

49
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,970
It was to end off the Power Gang

50
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,560
and revive the Xiao family.

51
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:54,590
Yiren,

52
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,130
I'm not blaming you.

53
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,710
The three of us

54
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,840
haven't had a meal together
like this for a long time.

55
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,590
We should really

56
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:07,470
stop doubting each other

57
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,680
for unnecessary things like this.

58
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm really tired.

59
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,310
I'm mentally exhausted.

60
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,520
Yiren.

61
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,400
Qiushui.

62
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,800
The dishes are getting cold.

63
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,130
We haven't eaten at all.

64
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,390
Let's eat some first.

65
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,430
Fine.

66
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,300
Tell me honestly then.

67
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,820
Is the Voidheart Codex

68
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,310
in your hands?

69
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,720
Yiren.

70
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,050
I really didn't take the Voidheart Codex.

71
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,390
I don't have it.

72
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,800
Looks like you're determined
to keep it for yourself.

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,750
You've taken the Infinite Pill

74
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:50,190
and learned other sects' martial arts,

75
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:52,790
instead of promoting
Huanhua's martial arts.

76
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:53,950
So,

77
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,580
you are not qualified to be the sect's
young leader.

78
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,630
In that case,

79
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,500
give me the Changge Sword.

80
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:09,360
Brother,

81
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:11,600
the codex you've been looking for

82
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,530
is also other sects' martial arts.

83
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:14,810
The Xiao family

84
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,480
can't be revived

85
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,810
by one's stubbornness.

86
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,680
Since I have the Changge Sword,

87
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,270
I won't give it up.

88
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,390
If you want it,

89
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,680
come and get it.

90
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,430
Yiren,
you have no respect for your brother!

91
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:30,360
What do you mean?

92
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,000
Qiushui...

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,730
Are you forcing me to fight you?

94
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,000
I don't mean that.

95
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,430
You're being extremely biased right now,

96
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:41,120
and you get to decide
what's good and what's not

97
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,870
for Huanhua
all based on your personal views.

98
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:45,680
So I can't give you the Changge Sword.

99
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:49,240
I, Xiao Yiren,
no longer have you as a brother!

100
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:03,160
Why are you getting more and more anxious?

101
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:09,870
Yiren.

102
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:13,510
You keep saying
that you want to revive the Xiao family.

103
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,800
What are we reviving?

104
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,770
It wouldn't be too late

105
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,120
for us to drink this wine

106
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,960
after we avenge our family.

107
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,600
This is the recommendation letter
from Uncle Kang.

108
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,400
I wish to compete fairly
for the Young Leadership.

109
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:56,960
Xiao Qiushui.

110
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,980
Why does he know
Shaolin and Wudang's martial arts?

111
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,900
The Xiao family

112
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,480
can't be revived

113
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,810
by one's stubbornness.

114
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,850
Since I have the Changge Sword,

115
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,390
I won't give it up.

116
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,560
If you want it,

117
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,810
come take it from me.

118
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,390
Who are you?

119
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,630
How dare you break into
my mansion at night?

120
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,000
Don't worry, Mr. Xiao.

121
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,310
Let me guess

122
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,560
why you are drinking alone here.

123
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:39,430
Is it cause your brother showed off
at the Golden Summit

124
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:42,310
and his martial arts and reputation
have surpassed yours.

125
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:43,770
This is our family affair.

126
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,800
It's none of your business.

127
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,600
With your current strength,

128
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,510
it's really hard for you
to outshine your younger brother

129
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:52,040
and restore your family's honor.

130
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,210
Why not borrow the power
from some dignitary?

131
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,170
What dignitary?

132
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,360
Think about it.

133
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,190
Who is the most powerful person
in the world?

134
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,160
It's easy for you to say.

135
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:06,640
Why would he help me?

136
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,160
As long as you help me get something
from the Nantian Abyss,

137
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,390
I can help you connect with him.

138
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,510
How do I know you're not lying?

139
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,870
As long as you help me get it,

140
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:21,390
you will believe everything I say.

141
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,720
I found these five masters.

142
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,830
From now on,
they will follow you secretly.

143
00:08:33,270 --> 00:08:34,270
They will help you

144
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,789
when you need help.

145
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,480
You used the Misery Pill
to torture us back then.

146
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,320
It's now your turn to enjoy

147
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,390
this pain so bad
that you wish you were dead.

148
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,790
Beg me, and I will give you some food.

149
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,440
Who do you think you are?

150
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,670
You're but a lowly prisoner,

151
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:08,110
yet you're saying such ridiculous things.

152
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:09,440
I'll teach you a lesson–

153
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,510
You're two days later than I expected.

154
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:27,950
Old Madam Tang just ordered to let me go.

155
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,790
Your expectations weren't wrong.

156
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,840
In order not to irritate Old Madam Tang,

157
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,200
Power Gang claimed
they had nothing to do with us.

158
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,120
Fortunately, you told me
to contact both sides.

159
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,650
This is from the other side.

160
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,530
The Falconry Whistle.

161
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,240
They want us to help

162
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,670
play a bigger game.

163
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,000
Northern Wasteland's
Intoxicating Bone Mist...

164
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,360
You are not from Daxi.

165
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,510
You have some knowledge of that place.

166
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,870
So what is

167
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:38,930
your real purpose?

168
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,550
I should be asking you this.

169
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,410
Didn't you always want to find me?

170
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:47,670
So,

171
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,630
I'm here.

172
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,030
You're R.

173
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:04,790
You're quite smart.

174
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:08,240
To be able to find me

175
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,450
through the Sword King.

176
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:16,600
Since you are determined to get it,

177
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,680
why don't you meet me
with your mask off?

178
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,000
Don't worry.

179
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,840
Before you die,

180
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,270
I will let you see my face.

181
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:31,510
But...

182
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,840
you are still of some other use.

183
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,790
This is...

184
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,280
With your internal energy,

185
00:14:09,670 --> 00:14:11,130
no one in the martial world

186
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:12,950
will be able to stand against me.

187
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,300
It's about time

188
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,600
for me to teach
the martial world a lesson.

189
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,000
The Voidheart Codex

190
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:20,320
is really him.

191
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,480
Such strong internal force.

192
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,360
I like it.

193
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:51,030
You've been following me for so long.

194
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,160
How can I lure you out

195
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,140
if I don't put up a more realistic act?

196
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,880
This man in black's martial arts are evil.

197
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,970
Why did he absorb my internal energy?

198
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:13,630
Who is he?

199
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:15,870
Qiushui.

200
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,200
You're back so late.

201
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:17,750
You must be hungry.

202
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,150
I saved some food for you.

203
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,670
I'm not eating.

204
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:28,970
I have no appetite.

205
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,270
I just... saw R.

206
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,320
R?

207
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,240
Is he Liu Suifeng?

208
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,270
No.

209
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,550
Who do you think he is?

210
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,170
Don't play dumb with me.

211
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,430
Let me ask you.

212
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,810
Do you know what secret

213
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,530
Li Chenzhou has?

214
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,630
Li Chenzhou

215
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,720
has an unknown identity.

216
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,720
He is the royal family of Daxi,

217
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,320
the brother of the emperor,

218
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:13,840
and the legitimate son
of the late emperor.

219
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,630
What legitimate?

220
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,750
That is, he's the son of the empress.

221
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,320
What in the soap opera...

222
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,480
Of course.

223
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,270
Given what you said,

224
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,630
the man in black used
the Northern Wasteland Drunken Bone Smoke.

225
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:36,560
It's a rare item.

226
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:40,510
Only those highly skilled
in the Northern Wasteland can get it.

227
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,840
If Li Chenzhou
is the royal family of Daxi,

228
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:45,040
he wouldn't have such close ties

229
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,540
with Northern Wasteland.

230
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:47,630
Exactly.

231
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,840
I also think it's not Li Chenzhou.

232
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:50,630
Look.

233
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,480
With the deep hatred between Daxi
and the Northern Wasteland,

234
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:56,680
it's impossible
for the Northern Wasteland to trust him.

235
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,120
This matter

236
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,000
is just our speculation.

237
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,520
At the Golden Summit,

238
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,000
I only met Li Chenzhou

239
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,829
briefly.

240
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:09,000
I didn't get to know more about him.

241
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:13,069
We can only investigate secretly

242
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:14,920
and see what he's up to.

243
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,070
Looks like there are more people here

244
00:17:40,070 --> 00:17:41,480
than we expected.

245
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,400
Other than those prominent sects
who were hit by the Tribulation Finger,

246
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:46,640
seems like there are also some people
who are not afraid of death

247
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,240
who heard that through the treasure hunt,
they could

248
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,970
get a share of the benefits too.

249
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,000
Let's go.

250
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,200
Yiren, Kaiyan,

251
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:07,790
Xiaoyi.

252
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:12,480
This trip will be dangerous.

253
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,510
Be careful.

254
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:20,830
Yiren,

255
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,450
don't be angry with him for now.

256
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,500
Let's do what's important first.

257
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:27,590
Let's go.

258
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:41,880
I see you guys have come.

259
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,750
But where is Chief Li?

260
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,680
Our Chief is delayed by something.

261
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,010
He is already on his way.

262
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,640
We can go first.

263
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,030
Chief Li launched this treasure hunt,

264
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,290
yet he hasn't shown up.

265
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,640
Is there something more to this?

266
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,110
Don't worry.

267
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,960
Looking at the time,

268
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,370
our Chief should not be far from here.

269
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,810
It's just a treasure hunt.

270
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,460
Do you need so many people?

271
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,830
As long as us Guidao Sect are here,

272
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,480
it is more than enough.

273
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,030
With your skills,

274
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:19,160
you would be poisoned to death
by the miasma

275
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,020
even before seeing the treasure.

276
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,830
The Nantian Abyss's terrain is dangerous.

277
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:30,750
It's covered by a miasma
throughout the year.

278
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,480
This fog is not made out of
ordinary water vapour.

279
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:34,510
It contains various

280
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,750
poisonous herbs' poison.

281
00:19:38,350 --> 00:19:39,790
This is just the beginning.

282
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,050
We don't know what other dangers it hides

283
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,350
deeper in there.

284
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,750
Everyone, be careful.

285
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,260
Since you're here,

286
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,640
how could you go back?

287
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,030
Set off according to the map.

288
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,160
The person who finds the treasure first

289
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,620
will be greatly rewarded.

290
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,510
Even if some of you die here,

291
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,790
the Power Gang will give you a reward

292
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:05,680
to comfort your family.

293
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,550
Let's go.

294
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,920
It seems that

295
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:17,680
Nantian Abyss is not that simple.

296
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,200
Be careful when you go in.

297
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:21,790
-Don't worry, Wugun.
-Don't worry.

298
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:22,520
Don't worry.

299
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,400
This journey to the Nantian Abyss
was initiated by the Chief.

300
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,880
But why are Shirong and Blade King

301
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,880
heading this now?

302
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,400
They asked us to follow behind them too.

303
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:47,870
Could it be...

304
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,940
The Chief has his own plan.

305
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,480
Just execute accordingly.

306
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,720
No need to say more things.

307
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,160
Yes.

308
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,240
After this miasma forest,

309
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,370
we'll be completely
in Nantian Abyss.

310
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,270
This place is full of poisonous miasma.

311
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,510
It's really dangerous to break in.

312
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:28,070
Yes.

313
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:28,880
Kaiyan,

314
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,760
how is your lightness skill?

315
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:31,830
Yiren,

316
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:34,110
although my swordsmanship is not advanced,

317
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,440
but my legs are not bad.

318
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,440
In my opinion,

319
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,480
the air above is thin.

320
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,620
You won't get poisoned there.

321
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:44,990
Just move over it with lightness skill.

322
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:45,920
Wait.

323
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,550
Look.

324
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,520
He's dead!

325
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,440
How high up do you have to go
with the lightness skill?

326
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,440
It's useless no matter how high you go.

327
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,790
It's useless no matter how high you go!

328
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:01,720
How can we pass?

329
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,750
Th-That's right.

330
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,050
We can't get over it.

331
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:10,160
Abundance of wealth
is right in front of us.

332
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,000
It's good
that people want to give up now.

333
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,130
We have lesser people to split it with.

334
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,650
I won't give up.

335
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,590
Let's go.

336
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,880
Those who are afraid of death can go back!

337
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,310
Come with me!

338
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,030
Who's afraid of death?

339
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,000
Everyone, follow me.

340
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,730
Hold your breath after we go in.

341
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,480
-Okay.
-Okay.

342
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:28,510
Follow me.

343
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,880
Be careful.

344
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,310
Don't die here.

345
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,000
Yes.

346
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,000
The Guidao Sect!

347
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,600
You despicable people!

348
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:56,920
How dare you

349
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,920
secretly make a move in the forest,

350
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,920
trying to harm me?

351
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,920
Everyone is looking for the treasure
with their skills.

352
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:03,920
If you're not as skilled last the others,

353
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:04,680
it doesn't matter if you're poisoned

354
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:05,750
or you fell to your death.

355
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,350
Your life is not up to you.

356
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:07,830
You...

357
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:08,790
Enough!

358
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:12,200
The road ahead is even more treacherous,

359
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,790
and it will require our united efforts.

360
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,680
If any of you seek
personal vengeance or gains

361
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,270
and stir up internal conflict,

362
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,160
I tell you this: when the Chief arrives,

363
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:22,620
the poison of your Tribulation Finger
will not be detoxified.

364
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,200
The same goes for everyone else.

365
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,030
It was foolish of me.

366
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,760
I dare not repeat this offense.

367
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:35,160
Qiushui,

368
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,880
look at this map.

369
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,110
it doesn’t mark
where the treasure is hidden.

370
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:40,770
How are we supposed to find it?

371
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:44,960
All right, look,

372
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,640
it's getting late,

373
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,830
and everyone's been searching
for a long time.

374
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,680
Why not hand over the maps you have?

375
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:51,810
Let's pool our ideas

376
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,740
and figure out where it really is.

377
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,150
What kind of mess is this?

378
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,140
Check here, everyone.

379
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,030
Don’t you think

380
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,740
this black pattern

381
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:10,240
on the map

382
00:24:10,830 --> 00:24:12,350
looks especially like a dragon?

383
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,200
Yeah, you’re right!

384
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,960
See this part: doesn’t it
resemble the dragon’s body?

385
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,000
And that—that’s a dragon claw!

386
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,460
Exactly, that’s the claw!

387
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,510
Wugun,

388
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,400
look over here.

389
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,750
Doesn’t this look like the dragon’s head
and a small claw?

390
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,440
Yes.

391
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,440
Could it be...

392
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,550
That's right.

393
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,920
Absolutely.
It really does look like a dragon,

394
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,440
and this is clearly the head.

395
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:29,110
The head...

396
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,110
Golden Dragon Lifts Its Head...

397
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,200
Golden Dragon Lifts Its Head?

398
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,000
G—Golden Dragon Lifts Its Head!

399
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:37,720
Let me see.

400
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,550
Alright then.

401
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,640
Since the "Golden Dragon Lifts Its Head"
should be found at the summit,

402
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,790
that's where we need to go.

403
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,450
Everyone, fan out from here

404
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,750
and follow the map to search for the site
of the "Golden Dragon Lifts Its Head."

405
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:53,680
Whoever finds it

406
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,460
send up a signal firework.

407
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:56,790
-Let's go.
-Let's go!

408
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:57,200
Go.

409
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,040
Let's go.

410
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,200
Everyone, this way.

411
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:00,860
Be careful!

412
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:01,560
Let's go.

413
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,440
Let's go.

414
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:04,120
Let's go!

415
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,750
We've been searching
for an entire day now,

416
00:25:24,750 --> 00:25:26,550
and still haven't found a thing.

417
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,030
Take this—it will temporarily
boost your power twofold

418
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,680
and suppress the effects
of the Tribulation Finger.

419
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,140
Come on.

420
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,750
Tonight, we only need to rest well.

421
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,610
Once we retrieve the treasure tomorrow,

422
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:12,550
we'll strike them by surprise.

423
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,590
Once this is done,

424
00:26:16,590 --> 00:26:19,110
Zhu the Great King
will surely reward us well.

425
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:19,750
Come on!

426
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,510
This place is vast.

427
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,030
Pass it to me.

428
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,070
No wonder the Power Gang

429
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:26,330
has gathered so many people to come here.

430
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:29,170
Traveling by night
is actually more dangerous.

431
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:30,370
I think it's better

432
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,830
to stay and rest for now,

433
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:35,510
and we can all continue the journey
first thing in the morning.

434
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,550
-Right!
-That's right.

435
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,010
Let's rest first.
Let them do the searching.

436
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,200
It's you...

437
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,680
Mr. Xiao,

438
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,110
I am aware that you hold little trust
in the Power Gang.

439
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:22,440
It is true that our sect is often
accused of ruthless actions

440
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,720
and indiscriminate killing
within the martial world.

441
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:28,380
However, the Power Gang
rarely kill anyone who's truly innocent.

442
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:33,550
Years ago, when the Northern Wasteland
invaded our Daxi,

443
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:35,920
a group known as
the Falconry Whistle emerged.

444
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,640
They conspired
with the Northern Wasteland,

445
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,640
providing them with detailed maps

446
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,640
of the Central Plains
to aid their military campaigns.

447
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,830
Many of those

448
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,410
we have recently eliminated were,

449
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,200
in fact, accomplices and followers
of the Falconry Whistle.

450
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,030
That rhetoric of yours certainly

451
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:50,640
absolves the Power Gang

452
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,590
of all blame.

453
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,480
So, by your logic,

454
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,920
even a renowned orthodox sect
like the Diancang Sect

455
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,120
was a lackey of the Northern Wasteland?

456
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,310
The Diancang Sect was indeed
part of the Falconry Whistle,

457
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:08,510
just like the Blood Talisman Sect,
which was wiped out by the White Phoenix.

458
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,920
You've said plenty,

459
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:13,130
but answer me this:

460
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,570
what about my Xiao family?

461
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,390
What about all those
innocent people who died?

462
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,650
I had actually given orders early

463
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,310
to only surround
the Xiao residence, not to kill.

464
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:31,000
But by the time the second group
of Power Gang forces arrived,

465
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,660
the Xiao family's Sword Manor

466
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:34,840
had already been breached.

467
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,680
What did you just say?

468
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:42,530
The one
who slaughtered your Xiao Family...

469
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,300
must have come from
within your own Sword Manor.

470
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:48,830
Impossible!

471
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,030
Li Chenzhou!

472
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,600
I saw it with my own eyes.

473
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,740
Senior Tianzheng and Senior Taichan

474
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:59,440
were killed by your Power Gang!

475
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:01,350
The Power Gang

476
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,880
does bear responsibility in this matter,

477
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:08,940
but only because someone used
the Thousand-Faces Mask to impersonate me

478
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,520
and order
the deaths of Tianzheng and Taichan,

479
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,370
leading to this grave mistake.

480
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,970
That is also
why I took your parents' remains.

481
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,880
My true intention

482
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,010
was to investigate
the cause of their deaths.

483
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,070
This was found

484
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,550
near their bodies,

485
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:35,550
though I do not know its meaning.

486
00:29:40,750 --> 00:29:41,680
Mr. Xiao,

487
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,440
it seems we share

488
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,790
the same enemy.

489
00:29:48,750 --> 00:29:50,640
After examination by the Herbal King,

490
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,110
it was confirmed that your parents
were killed by a finger technique

491
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:56,110
so rare that almost no one
in this world recognized it.

492
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:59,000
Could it be
that Li Chenzhou truly isn't the R?

493
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,260
With all that said,

494
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:09,280
which sect
does this finger technique belong to?

495
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,510
After we return from the Nantian Abyss,

496
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,200
I will see to it
that your parents' remains

497
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,060
are returned to the Huanhua Sect.

498
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,960
As for the origins and details
of this finger technique,

499
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,360
I will share all
that I know with you as well.

500
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,550
Li Chenzhou,

501
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:27,880
stop being so cryptic.

502
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,400
This expedition to the Nantian Abyss
is highly suspicious.

503
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,550
Could the Power Gang

504
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,930
truly not have found the treasure

505
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:39,110
without the help of these sects?

506
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,200
Or did you gather all these people here

507
00:30:44,030 --> 00:30:45,760
with some other agenda in mind?

508
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,960
Why?

509
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,390
Who is really pulling the strings
behind all this?

510
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,900
Golden Dragon Lifts Its Head.

511
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,330
The door is open!

512
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,720
Thanks to Mr. Xiao's sharp eyes.

513
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:29,450
How about you take the lead and

514
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,540
go check the path ahead for us?

515
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,720
-Qiushui.
-Why don't you go in? You go!

516
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,240
Go!

517
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,510
The situation inside is unclear.

518
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,440
Everyone, wait here—

519
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:42,790
that way, when I come out,
there will be someone to provide backup.

520
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:43,400
Qiushui,

521
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:45,560
you must be extremely careful.

522
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,120
Don't worry, Kaiyan.

523
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,030
-Wugun, be careful.
-Be careful!

524
00:32:57,030 --> 00:32:58,430
He went in just like that?

525
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,030
Let's go in too.

526
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,230
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

527
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,770
Why won't you let us in?

528
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,610
We're already here!

529
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,960
What gives you the right to stop us?

530
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,440
That's right. We want to go in too.

531
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,030
Let us in!

532
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:15,760
What kind of scheme
is the Power Gang pulling now?

533
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,400
Did you plan to use us

534
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,880
and then keep all the treasure
for yourselves?

535
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,590
T—That's right! Yeah!

536
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:22,120
Why won’t you let us in? Why?

537
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:23,000
Everyone,

538
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,720
as you all witnessed
atop the Golden Summit,

539
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,350
the Third Young Master of the Xiao family
possesses remarkable skill.

540
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:29,950
If even he cannot make it out,

541
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,770
any attempt of yours
would be equally futile.

542
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,000
Moreover,

543
00:33:34,350 --> 00:33:36,750
Mr. Xiao has always
regarded us as enemies.

544
00:33:37,070 --> 00:33:38,270
With him also inside,

545
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:40,240
how can anyone claim the Power Gang
seeks to monopolize the treasure?

546
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,350
I don't believe you.

547
00:33:41,350 --> 00:33:42,590
Your words sound fair,

548
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,850
but I insist on going in
to see for myself.

549
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:45,590
I...

550
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,720
Everyone, please remain calm.

551
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:51,240
The treasure is right here—

552
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,510
it isn’t going anywhere.

553
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,880
I believe Mr. Xiao ventured ahead

554
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,870
with everyone’s safety in mind,

555
00:33:57,110 --> 00:33:59,570
hoping to prevent unnecessary casualties.

556
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,400
-What's going on?
-What happened inside?

557
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,800
Oh no, Qiushui is in trouble!

558
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,330
Save him!

559
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:41,440
Wait.

560
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,280
The situation is unclear right now.

561
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,440
It’d be better for us
to split up and move separately.

562
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,110
Fuhu Sect,

563
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:46,800
Wuyi Gang,

564
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:47,960
and Guidao Sect:

565
00:34:48,150 --> 00:34:49,550
follow the Power Gang

566
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,590
to the south to find a suitable spot

567
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,360
to place explosives,

568
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,280
breach the rock face,

569
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,320
and rescue Mr. Xiao.

570
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,250
The rest of you, stay here and wait.

571
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:58,320
Is that acceptable?

572
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:02,310
This is leaving all of us
just waiting around here?

573
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,180
-Fine.
-What exactly is going on inside?

574
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,190
Why should we even listen to her?

575
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,230
-Y—yeah, exactly!
-I'll listen to you. Let's go!

576
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,510
-Go.
-Go!

577
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,710
-Wugun!
-Wugun!

578
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:18,000
Wugun!

579
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,130
Let's think of a way.

580
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,030
See if there's anywhere else

581
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,280
we can get in.

582
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,210
By tomorrow, every sect

583
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:41,070
will have been affected
by the Tribulation Finger.

584
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:42,510
Those affected will

585
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,920
inevitably suffer heart-scorching agony.

586
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
In his bid to seize the treasure,

587
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,190
Zhu the Great King
has forced all his followers

588
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:52,450
to take a pill that drastically
enhances internal energy—

589
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,010
one that also temporarily
suppresses the Tribulation Finger.

590
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:58,110
So tomorrow, whoever shows
no sign of being affected

591
00:35:58,110 --> 00:36:00,570
will surely be an agent
of Zhu the Great King.

592
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:03,960
I will give you the signal tomorrow.

593
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:08,320
Esteemed Sect Leaders:
we'll leave this cave entrance to you

594
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,980
I will lead the gang members
forward to continue the exploration.

595
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,030
Let's go!

596
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:20,110
Stop wasting time.

597
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,040
Open up the cave.

598
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,090
Finding the gold is what matters.

599
00:36:23,670 --> 00:36:24,230
Let's go.

600
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,560
The treasure lies
right behind the mountain.

601
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:48,920
This is the Chief's order:

602
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:51,580
the true location of the treasure
is right here.

603
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:52,320
Go!

604
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,760
Find the weakest point on the rock face.

605
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,110
Blast through it and breach inside!

606
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:56,770
-Yes!
-Yes!

607
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:11,850
Let's go.

608
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,510
Once inside,
we will split up and act separately.

609
00:37:13,510 --> 00:37:14,000
Good.

610
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:20,970
Move it.

611
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:21,710
Yes.

612
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,600
There really is treasure! Gold!

613
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,530
We're rich now!

614
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,280
Mine, mine, mine!

615
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:49,730
Everyone, stay sharp
and proceed with caution.

616
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:02,200
Zhao Shirong!

617
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,030
All of this was deliberately arranged
by your Power Gang!

618
00:38:06,030 --> 00:38:08,670
Your Guidao Sect, along with Wuyi Gang
and Fuhu Sect,

619
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:10,710
pledged allegiance to Zhu the Great King

620
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:13,110
and secretly destroyed countless
Power Gang strongholds.

621
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:15,920
It's time we settled this account.

622
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:18,000
What a pity—

623
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:19,320
for all your loyalty,

624
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,510
Zhu the Great King

625
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:23,040
remains hidden in the shadows
until this day,

626
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,100
too cowardly to show his face.

627
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,920
So you knew all along.

628
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,800
This entire affair at Nantian Abyss

629
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,530
was all a scheme orchestrated
by your Power Gang.

630
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,930
If you hadn't been scheming yourselves,

631
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,670
how could you
have taken the bait so easily?

632
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,000
We were all coerced here

633
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,760
by your Power Gang.

634
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:40,840
If anything happens to us here,

635
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,140
how will you answer
to the entire martial world?

636
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:55,190
That need not concern you.

637
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,340
Show yourself.

638
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,810
Though the Nantian Abyss is treacherous,

639
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,460
it could hardly hold
the Power Gang captive.

640
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:16,560
If you desired these treasures,

641
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,200
you need not have resorted
to such schemes—

642
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,710
luring us all here.

643
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,990
What is it you truly seek?

644
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,800
Qiushui, are you hurt?

645
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,230
Qiushui!

646
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:33,400
I'm fine. All good.

647
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,610
Wugun, are you okay?

648
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,360
Guys!

649
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,360
We're rich! Haul it all away!

650
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,030
Wait!

651
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,190
Be careful—the hidden arrows
might be poisoned.

652
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,120
Try not to make contact
while handling the treasure.

653
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:05,760
-Move it!
-Let's go!

654
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,890
-Move it!
-Let's go!

655
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,160
-Hurry up.
-Move it.

656
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,560
Real gold! Pure gold!

657
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,440
Give me a hand here!

658
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,230
Mr. Xiao.

659
00:40:24,150 --> 00:40:24,950
Zhao Shirong,

660
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,960
back at Mount Emei's Golden Summit,

661
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,480
your Power Gang promised everyone

662
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,440
that this expedition to Nantian Abyss

663
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,440
wasn't for selfish gain.

664
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:35,840
Now the treasure is found.

665
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,230
How you handle it—

666
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,320
you owe us all an explanation.

667
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,920
-Yeah, exactly!
-That's right!

668
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,050
That's right. Give us an explanation.

669
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:45,910
Mr. Xiao, why ask
when you already know the answer?

670
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:48,230
The affairs of the border
are no secret to us.

671
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:51,710
The Northern Wasteland army has now
massed heavy forcesat Immortal Pass.

672
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:53,630
The Wu Army, which had been
winning successive victories,

673
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,890
has now shifted from offense to defense.

674
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,590
With your Power Gang's reputation
within the Daxi martial world,

675
00:40:59,590 --> 00:41:01,400
how could you ever earn everyone's trust?

676
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,330
And now this sudden display
of patriotic concern...

677
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,760
Mr. Xiao,

678
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,150
let's put the right and wrong aside,

679
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:11,000
But the Power Gang has never

680
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,060
acted against the interests of Daxi.

681
00:41:17,710 --> 00:41:20,570
Where are the members
of the Wuyi Gang and Fuhu Sect?

682
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,400
-Right.
-Where are they?

683
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,550
-And what about the Guidao Sect?
-Yeah! Where are they?

684
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:26,360
-Why aren't them here?
-How has no one noticed until now?

685
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,160
Zhao Shirong!

686
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:28,960
Did they set out together

687
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,800
with your Power Gang?

688
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,670
So why is there now
no trace of any of them?

689
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:32,470
Zhao Shirong,

690
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,760
you made this plan.

691
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,400
They followed you.

692
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,960
Where are they now?

693
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,590
Your Power Gang
must have schemed in secret

694
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:40,450
to murder them!

695
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:43,030
Yes, it's you.

696
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:44,190
-Right.
-That's right.

697
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,670
-Exactly!
-That's right.

698
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,760
-It was you!
-It was all your doing!

699
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:47,960
Everyone, hear this:

700
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,440
the Power Gang only executes
those who deserve to die.

701
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,360
Arguing about it here will

702
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,880
only delay what truly matters.

703
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:06,340
Right now, our priority is
to retrieve the treasure—quickly.

704
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,320
The Power Gang pledges this:

705
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:11,520
one-tenth will be divided
among those who aided us today.

706
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:13,000
As for the remainder...

707
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,940
all of it shall belong to Daxi,

708
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:16,550
to support the frontier.

709
00:42:22,150 --> 00:42:23,000
Which 10% ?

710
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,000
There is so much here.

711
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:33,590
Yiren!
