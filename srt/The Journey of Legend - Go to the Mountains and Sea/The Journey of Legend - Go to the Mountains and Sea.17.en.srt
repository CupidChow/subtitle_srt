[The Journey of Legend]

00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,920
[Episode 17]

3
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,000
Where did you get this token?

4
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,680
What did you do to my family?

5
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:10,310
It doesn't matter what I did.

6
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,190
Just think about what you should do.

7
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,240
Now, only you can save

8
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,030
the Xiao family.

9
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,960
Young Master Xiao,

10
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,760
why not give him the token now?

11
00:02:27,079 --> 00:02:28,810
-Give it to him. Please.
-Yeah.

12
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,050
-Let him have it.
-Right.

13
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:32,710
-Do it.
-Give it to him, will you?
-Give it to him.

14
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:38,940
I really don't know
where the Hero Command Token is.

15
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,450
It's not here, he said.

16
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,200
Then think harder.

17
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:45,710
Try to recall what happened
after you met Old Madam Wu.

18
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,780
If you are not to die with them,

19
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,790
then try to think of something.

20
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:22,010
It's the Seven-Step Deadly Formation
of Tang Sect...

21
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,930
Was Xiao Qiushui taken away by Tang Sect?

22
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,030
I told you to leave this lad alone.

23
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,590
Exactly.

24
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:00,990
But none of you listened.

25
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,320
If you ask me,

26
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,960
I'd say let's have his limbs broken
like ours

27
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,000
to make him spill the truth.

28
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,840
I agree!

29
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,000
My legs...

30
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,430
Dear friends,

31
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,770
even if you take all my limbs apart,

32
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,910
your injuries simply won't heal.

33
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,650
This is all your fault.

34
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,720
Right now,

35
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,040
our only option is to work as a team

36
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:29,070
to find a way out of this place.

37
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,920
My sister Xiao Xueyu

38
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,710
is an amazing doctor.

39
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:37,159
I believe she will cure all of you.

40
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,600
Xiao Xueyu?

41
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,159
That's great.

42
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,600
No, no, no.

43
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,400
Are you really that kind?

44
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,070
Well,

45
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,650
I'm actually not that kind.

46
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:52,680
But think about this.

47
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,510
Liu Suifeng

48
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,480
is a ruthless man.

49
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,360
Do you think he'll set you guys free?

50
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,420
-No, he won't.
-No way.

51
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:03,610
So,

52
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,190
we are

53
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,070
in the same boat now.

54
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:09,800
That means we need to

55
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,640
stand in solidarity, make joint efforts,

56
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,390
and figure out
how to get out of this place.

57
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,640
We're in the same boat...

58
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,680
T-That makes us a team of five now, right?

59
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,860
A team of five?

60
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,070
A team of five?

61
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,920
F-Five...

62
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:28,870
Correct.

63
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,820
We are a team of five now.

64
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:33,870
W-Well, if we really make it out of here,

65
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:34,730
but your sister

66
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,680
refuses to treat our broken legs,

67
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,740
then what can we do?

68
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,990
-That's a possibility.
-Right!
-Yeah.

69
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,200
That won't happen.

70
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,310
My sister

71
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,680
has a good heart.

72
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,090
If you save my life,

73
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:46,680
then I'll be indebted to you.

74
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,140
Since I'm indebted to you,

75
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,370
my family will definitely help you.

76
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,890
I don't believe it.

77
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:53,720
You're lying.

78
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,620
Fine. You may not have trust in my sister.

79
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,750
But you do know about Tang Sect, right?

80
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:01,510
Tang Sect

81
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,400
has a remarkable therapy for broken bones.

82
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,430
I have a friend

83
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,610
named Tang Fang.

84
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,590
Although she's a bit
hot-tempered, bossy,

85
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,800
and perhaps unreasonable,

86
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,830
I have firm belief

87
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,890
that if you help me out of here,

88
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,650
she'll definitely cure all of you.

89
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:23,270
-Sounds nice.
-Good.

90
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,190
Good idea.

91
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,490
Donglin, you do it.

92
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:26,950
Me?

93
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:27,560
I...

94
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,560
Donglin, you're huge.

95
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,490
Go break it open.

96
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,950
Just do it. I don't have any tools.

97
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,750
-Okay.
-Hurry. I can't move my legs.

98
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:33,560
Hurry!

99
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,670
Here comes Liu Suifeng!

100
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,750
Xiao Qiushui,

101
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,250
what on earth happened?

102
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,980
Didn't you already...

103
00:06:58,310 --> 00:07:00,640
I had to make a snap judgement
at that time.

104
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,830
This is quite a complicated matter.

105
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:08,270
I'll explain everything to you
in due time.

106
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,280
How dare you lie to me again?

107
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,050
Nobody in the martial world
has the guts to lie to me.

108
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,870
You even locked me up in an iron cage.
How could you?

109
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:21,430
You must be

110
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:24,360
the kind-hearted sister
he told us about, right?

111
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,270
She must be!

112
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,330
She's obviously the bossy Miss Tang!

113
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:28,160
Shut up!

114
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,070
M-Miss Tang?

115
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,180
I'll give you a chance.

116
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,610
Explain now.

117
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:47,520
I can't put my friends in danger again.

118
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,550
If something bad happens to you,

119
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,480
I'll be utterly guilty about Rou
till the day I die.

120
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,730
You can talk when we're out of here.

121
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:05,430
T-That's right.

122
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,960
When Liu Suifeng comes here again,

123
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,560
Miss Tang,

124
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,110
you'll suffer like us.

125
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,310
Exactly.

126
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:17,390
Liu Suifeng? You met Liu Suifeng?

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,560
Yes, we did.

128
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,510
Look at my leg.

129
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,970
-And my arm.
-He maimed us.

130
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:23,860
That's right.

131
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,520
Feng Lang is Liu Suifeng.

132
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:34,890
The target isn't here. Retreat.

133
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:41,650
When we were fighting the enemy,

134
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,890
I was indeed confused.

135
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,150
Song Mingzhu has great martial skills.

136
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,280
She shouldn't have feared him so much.

137
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,840
But if he really is Liu Suifeng,

138
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,850
then that would make sense.

139
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,590
Besides, the setting here...

140
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,200
How is he related to Tang Sect?

141
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,000
We're pressed for time now.

142
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,200
Let's resume the conversation
after we escape.

143
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,960
-Right.
-Yeah. Get out of here first.

144
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,160
Let's get out of here.

145
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:11,810
Half of the traps here have been disabled.

146
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:14,480
The four of you, protect him.

147
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:15,960
If you help Mr. Xiao out,

148
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,460
I'll treat you
with the medicine exclusive to Tang Sect.

149
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,100
Terrific!

150
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:19,510
Miss Tang...

151
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:21,720
-Deal!
-It's a pact now, Miss Tang.

152
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:38,840
Master.

153
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,160
Your formation has been broken.

154
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,820
Someone rescued Xiao Qiushui.

155
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,140
This person not only solved
this intricate formation of Tang Sect,

156
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,740
but also saved Xiao Qiushui.

157
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,630
Could it be her?

158
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,240
Fang,

159
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,320
is he

160
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,290
really that important to you?

161
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,600
Go!

162
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,060
Donglin!

163
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,040
Step aside.

164
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,510
The poison has been eroding
your meridians for too long.

165
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:28,460
I'm afraid even its antidote can't help.

166
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,070
Eat this.

167
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:32,800
Thank you.

168
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,630
For that potent poison,

169
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,830
I gave a pill that absorbs ants' toxins.

170
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,270

192
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:08,750
Thank you.

193
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:11,120
Miss Tang,

194
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,870
I've noticed you're just

195
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,750
as an incredible healer

196
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,810
as that gentle and caring Xiao Xueyu.

197
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,510
Right!

198
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,270
You also know Xiao Xueyu?

199
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:22,120
Not really.

200
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,840
We heard about her from him.

201
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:24,600
He told us about her.

202
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,930
Yes, exactly.

203
00:12:26,550 --> 00:12:28,750
He said you're difficult, bossy,

204
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,720
-and unreasonable.
-That's right.

205
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,550
Will you treat us

206
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:35,440
without us begging you?

207
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,320
Will you?

208
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,210
Is that what you told them?

209
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,600
Stop talking nonsense,

210
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,590
or I'll break all your limbs.

211
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,430
I didn't mean any of that.

212
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,250
Boring.

213
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,750
Have it back. You're its owner.

214
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:05,610
Keep your own stuff for yourself.

215
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:24,360
Qiushui,

216
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,530
I have one more favor to ask.

217
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,080
This is called the Golden Swallow.

218
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,060
An old friend of mine left it to me.

219
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,630
He was known as the best

220
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,500
and the most feared fighter
in the martial world years ago—

221
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:54,050
Crazy Yan.

222
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,720
He was once a disciple of Elder Wubei's,

223
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,080
and the sole inheritor
of the Voidheart Codex.

224
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,800
Out of jealousy, his fellow disciples

225
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,250
kidnapped his younger brother and sister

226
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:11,960
to coerce him
into surrendering the Voidheart Codex.

227
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,790
But after Mr. Yan gave them the book,

228
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:15,630
those people ate their words.

229
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,080
As a result, Mr. Yan spent 10 years

230
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:21,390
searching desperately for his siblings.

231
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,960
Just when he found a lead,

232
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,550
the Northern Wastelanders happened to

233
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:30,150
have sent masters from beyond the borders
to assassinate my son.

234
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,870
Mr. Yan put his frantic search on hold

235
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:35,360
and rushed to save my son's life.

236
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:41,960
Again, he lost the trail
of his brother and sister.

237
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:49,120
People all say Crazy Yan looked down on
everyone in the martial world

238
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,160
with utter impudence.

239
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:53,320
But surprisingly,

240
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,280
he actually had a chivalrous nature.

241
00:14:57,270 --> 00:14:58,080
Later on,

242
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:00,600
Mr. Yan continued his search
at his maximum capacity,

243
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,730
only to find his younger brother dead.

244
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:07,000
He slaughtered many a sect
when he hunted for the killer.

245
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,240
Being one step away from total madness,

246
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,200
he became Crazy Yan,
who was dreaded by everyone.

247
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,750
His obsession
with finding his younger sister

248
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,200
drove him to turn the martial world
into a complete chaos.

249
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,780
That was why he was finally besieged
on Wuxing Mountain

250
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,690
and knocked off Nantian Abyss.

251
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,000
Despite all that,

252
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:35,440
Mr. Yan did do my family a big favor
and show great dedication to the country.

253
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,550
The Wu family is indebted to him.

254
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,360
In the end,

255
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,270
he left nothing
but this Gold Swallow in haste.

256
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,460
What about his sister?

257
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,320
Over these years,

258
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,770
I've been looking everywhere
for Mr. Yan's sister.

259
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,120
But I'm afraid

260
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,190
it'll take a long time to find her

261
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,970
in this vast martial world.

262
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,750
I'm already old.

263
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:11,030
So, I'd like to entrust you
with this Golden Swallow as a keepsake,

264
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,120
and the task of finding

265
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:16,790
Mr. Yan's only surviving family member.

266
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,030
Old Madam Wu,

267
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,910
I will do my utmost to find her.

268
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,960
Miss Tang...

269
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,790
Miss Tang, sorry to interrupt you.

270
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:52,360
Miss Tang!

271
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:56,070
Miss Tang... Miss Tang...

272
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:57,790
Miss Tang!

273
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:05,480
This is the Bone Repairing Salve.

274
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,130
Apply it evenly on the joints.

275
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:10,260
Then your broken limbs
will be able to move temporarily.

276
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:11,920
However,

277
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,480
you still need a skilled physician

278
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:16,250
to fix your injuries for good.

279
00:17:16,770 --> 00:17:17,329
Besides,

280
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,270
this is the Jade Recovery Powder.

281
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,640
Take it,

282
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:25,089
and the seal on your internal energy
will be lifted in time.

283
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,310
Stop fighting for them!

284
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:30,400
-My leg!
-Give me a bottle!
-You're on my leg!

285
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,800
-Stop fighting.
-Get up!

286
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,790
Give me a bottle.

287
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:35,550
Qiushui,

288
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:38,160
what exactly happened?

289
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:39,870
How did you...

290
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,010
come back from the dead?

291
00:17:45,590 --> 00:17:47,270
G-Give it to m-me...

292
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:49,830
Perhaps that hit from Qu Hanshan

293
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,290
put me in a state of suspended animation.

294
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,350
It hurts!

295
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,040
That made me look dead.

296
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,750
Here, here.

297
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,490
-It's too much.
-This will do.

298
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:05,240
Give it to me.

299
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,010
I'm just glad you're fine.

300
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:08,890
No grabbing!

301
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:13,350
What will you do next?

302
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,750
Let me do it.

303
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,590
Yes, right here.

304
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:20,680
-Let me do it. You don't know how.
-Not so hard!

305
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,110
About the Sword King and Liu Suifeng...

306
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:23,770
Let me help.

307
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,420
I did my best to hold them off previously.

308
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,970
Now, I must head back to Huanhua Sect
as soon as possible.

309
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,880
I hope Yiren has arrived.

310
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:34,770
-Give it to me!
-Let me have it!
-Look at that!

311
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,820
We'll set out
when they're done applying the salve.

312
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,960
Okay.

313
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,790
Xueyu!

314
00:18:59,070 --> 00:18:59,590
Xueyu!

315
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:00,270
What's wrong?

316
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,000
Are you okay?

317
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,680
I'm fine. It's an urgent trip.

318
00:19:04,070 --> 00:19:04,920
Let's keep going.

319
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:05,720
Young Master!

320
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:07,830
Young Master,

321
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,030
Second Young Master and Mr. Zuoqiu

322
00:19:09,030 --> 00:19:10,350
are still nowhere to be found.

323
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,150
Young Master!

324
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,790
Young Master,

325
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:13,720
good news.

326
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,550
Third Young Master is still alive.

327
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,750
What did you just say?

328
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,030
Did someone tell you that,

329
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,090
or did you see it yourself?

330
00:19:19,090 --> 00:19:21,310
I was told that Third Young Master
had been seen alive.

331
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:23,270
So, I carefully inquired about him
along the way.

332
00:19:23,270 --> 00:19:25,270
Someone did see Third Young Master.

333
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,610
What a blessing!

334
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,080
Qiushui is still alive.

335
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,350
Great.

336
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,450
Qiushui...

337
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,610
would probably rush back
to the Sword Manor right away.

338
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,650
-Xueyu.
-Yiren...

339
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,010
-Xueyu!
-Xueyue!

340
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:45,500
Xueyu!

341
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,510
It's snake venom.

342
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,640
How did this happen?

343
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:55,790
Xueyu was so eager
to return to the Sword Manor

344
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,480
that she chose to keep her injury secret.

345
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,640
If she hurries on with the journey,

346
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,590
she might die.

347
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:01,760
But now, the Sword Manor...

348
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,650
I'll stay and try to help Xueyu.

349
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,510
Yiren,

350
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,160
your priority is to go back
to the Sword Manor

351
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,360
to save your parents.

352
00:20:10,110 --> 00:20:11,040
You two stay put.

353
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:12,510
The rest will leave with me.

354
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,170
-Yes!
-Yes!

355
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,400
My leg is healed!

356
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:31,590
My arm is healed!

357
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,830
My leg is fine now!

358
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,130
A full recovery!

359
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,200
-How wonderful.
-All is fine now.
-My leg is fixed!

360
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,110
Thank you, Miss Tang.

361
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:43,270
-Thank you, Miss Tang.
-Many thanks, Miss Tang.

362
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:43,960
Thank you.

363
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:45,940
Why did you hit me?

364
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,270
I lost control of my arm!

365
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,480
You guys were in a mess just now.

366
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,110
Did you not the apply the salve evenly,

367
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,400
so your meridians went out of order?

368
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,470
-Donglin!
-I...

369
00:20:55,550 --> 00:20:56,790
I told you not to rush!

370
00:20:56,790 --> 00:20:57,720
Why did you have to fight over the salve?

371
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,450
What did that have to do with me?

372
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,510
Liu Suifeng,

373
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,070
you just can't stop hounding me.

374
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,730
Liu Suifeng,

375
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,680
you know about
the formations of Tang Sect.

376
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,920
How are you related to Tang Sect?

377
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:39,880
Back off, Fang.

378
00:21:44,550 --> 00:21:45,640
You can't stop me.

379
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,580
You called me Fang?

380
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,690
I'm Feng, your childhood friend.

381
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,720
Feng, run!

382
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,480
Little brat,

383
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,540
how dare you set free the boy I picked!

384
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,310
-Fang!
-Feng!

385
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:33,680
You really are Feng?

386
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,510
I meant to reunite with you
in a better way.

387
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:42,190
So you're from Tang Sect.

388
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,430
As my bosom friend, Feng,

389
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,000
why would you help the Power Gang do evil,

390
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:52,480
and constantly fight against
the Xiao family?

391
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,600
Do you remember how I was

392
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,790
taken in by Tang Sect years ago?

393
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:04,130
Tang Yaoshun impregnated my mother.
Then, they had me.

394
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:08,030
Afterwards, he went back to Tang Sect
as its master,

395
00:23:08,030 --> 00:23:09,200
while my mother and I

396
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,130
stayed alone in Baicao Valley.

397
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,760
However, that vile creature

398
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,770
Xiao Xilou led many from the martial world

399
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:19,520
to raid and butcher Baicao Valley.

400
00:23:27,550 --> 00:23:29,270
I had a narrow escape from that disaster.

401
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:31,680
I meant to ask Old Madam Tang
to help me seek revenge,

402
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,110
but she just ignored me.

403
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,510
From my perspective,

404
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:37,450
back then, Baicao Valley made...

405
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,960
B-Baicao Valley made the Marching Pills

406
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,810
for those invaders

407
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:42,270
from the Northern Wasteland.

408
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,070
Thanks to Mr. Xiao Qiushui's father

409
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:46,630
and other righteous martial practitioners,
that place was finally flattened.

410
00:23:46,630 --> 00:23:48,460
The people there deserved it!

411
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,970
-Yes. They deserved it!
-They did!
-Yeah!

412
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:54,790
-They got their just deserts!
-They did!
-Right!

413
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,570
Nonsense!

414
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:03,030
Baicao Valley always
stood aloof from worldly affairs.

415
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,170
How could we have possibly
colluded with the enemy?

416
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,880
It was that schemer Xiao Xilou's fault.

417
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,510
His greed for our pills and elixirs

418
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,750
compelled him

419
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:16,350
to frame Baicao Valley
and commit atrocities.

420
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,260
My father would never harm the innocent.

421
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,010
You're talking gibberish.

422
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,380
I witnessed

423
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,390
their brutality and violence.

424
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,510
Fang,

425
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,950
now that you've learned the truth,

426
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,550
you shouldn't try to stop me.

427
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:35,850
Don't call me Fang.

428
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:38,350
You're no longer

429
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:40,070
the Feng I knew in childhood.

430
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,570
Now, in my eyes,

431
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,550
you're just the overbearing

432
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,280
deputy chief of the Power Gang,

433
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,790
Liu Suifeng.

434
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,590
I joined the Power Gang
by a strange quirk of fate.

435
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,590
I'll tell you the details later.

436
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:53,390
But right now,

437
00:24:54,030 --> 00:24:55,830
I must get the Hero Command Token

438
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,540
and find the Voidheart Codex.

439
00:24:59,160 --> 00:24:59,750
Fang,

440
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,720
I know you have your missions too.

441
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:02,850
When I get the codex,

442
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,970
I'll definitely lend it to you.

443
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:07,030
Why do you have to stick with this man

444
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,840
and put yourself in danger?

445
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,140
I don't need your help.

446
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:15,760
I did come here for the codex,

447
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,210
but I care about other things too.

448
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,480
I'm deeply aware of what can be done

449
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,960
and what cannot be done

450
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,110
in the martial world.

451
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,950
I quest for what I want

452
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,680
in an honest and fair way.

453
00:25:29,590 --> 00:25:31,950
I didn't rescue you from hell years ago

454
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,430
only to let you

455
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,190
drag others into hell.

456
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,720
Fang,

457
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,620
you can't make me stop.

458
00:25:58,270 --> 00:25:59,270
Deputy Chief Liu,

459
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:02,230
isn't it against
the ethics of the martial world

460
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:05,360
to attack someone
who has lost all his martial strength?

461
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,100
Well said!

462
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,020
[Prince Liang of Daxi, Glow Achiever]
[Liang Dou]

463
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,670
I've led a troop to this very place.

464
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,230
Liu Suifeng, you'd better tread lightly.

465
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,170
Your Highness,

466
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:39,030
why not go be a carefree prince

467
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,850
and stay out of this mess
involving the Xiao family?

468
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,460
Xilou and his wife are my close friends.

469
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,640
Even catastrophes

470
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,860
can't deter me from helping them,

471
00:26:50,860 --> 00:26:52,390
let alone this little mess.

472
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:56,590
What now?

473
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:59,190
Why don't you leave already?

474
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,240
Do you fancy a fight with us?

475
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:05,110
May our paths never cross again

476
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,640
in this vast martial world.

477
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,970
Oh, right. Qiushui,

478
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,330
how are your injuries?

479
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,830
I'm much better now.

480
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,290
Your Highness,
thank you for saving my life.

481
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,830
Now, I'm afraid

482
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,970
Xiao's Sword Manor won't hold up
for much longer.

483
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:33,830
Your Highness, please lend me some horses,

484
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,690
so I can go back soon.

485
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,980
Consider it done.

486
00:27:37,550 --> 00:27:39,510
I've prepared several fast horses for you.

487
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,710
They can be your ride.

488
00:27:40,750 --> 00:27:41,750
I heard the sect leaders

489
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,270
of Shaolin and Wudang had set out.

490
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:44,590
You're severely injured now.

491
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,990
Let me go meet them first.

492
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,840
Your Highness, I promise

493
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,490
to repay the generous help
you offered today.

494
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:11,360
Chief.

495
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,360
Suifeng,

496
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,240
where is the Hero Command Token?

497
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,420
Forgive my incompetence.

498
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,120
I failed to get the token.

499
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,800
You've always been meticulous.

500
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,500
Why did you keep failing the tasks

501
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,730
involving the Xiao family?

502
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,610
I tried my best, Chief.

503
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,490
You've shown absolute loyalty
to the gang over these years.

504
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,200
But now,
you've had several failures in a row.

505
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:44,010
Even if I keep silent about it,

506
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,770
how will you command respect from others?

507
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,670
I swear I will bring back
the Hero Command Token

508
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:52,650
to convince everyone in the gang.

509
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,640
Tang Sect, Shaolin Sect and Wudang Sect

510
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,610
have stayed cleared of the affairs
of the martial world for a long time,

511
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,840
yet they're now unanimously intervening
with these matters about the Xiao family.

512
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,500
Shaolin Sect and Wudang Sect?

513
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,510
The intelligence I just received says

514
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:12,070
the sect leaders of Shaolin and Wudang
have rushed to the Xiao Residence.

515
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,240
Go stop them.

516
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,460
Get them out of the way.

517
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:19,480
Got it.

518
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:29,380
[Wave-Listening Pavilion]

519
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:31,830
Master,

520
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,290
if we fight Shaolin Sect and Wudang Sect
at the same time,

521
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,290
there might be...

522
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:43,030
Might be what?

523
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,290
Deputy Chief,

524
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:47,880
Tianzheng has mighty strength.

525
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,310
His internal energy alone
can penetrate everything.

526
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,310
On the other hand, Taichan's sword skills

527
00:29:52,310 --> 00:29:53,350
are flexible, variable,

528
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,640
and unfathomable.

529
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,230
[Fist Demon, Sheng Jiangbei]
[Flying-Dagger Demon, Sun Rentu]

530
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,430
If those two join forces,

531
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,500
they can make a perfect duo in combat.

532
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:07,910
I'm afraid
we'll have a slim chance of victory.

533
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,070
It's the chief's order.

534
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,720
Even if we have to die,

535
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:15,040
what's there to regret?

536
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:17,070
Yes.

537
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,070
Yes.

538
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:24,710
That said,

539
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:29,150
it's no doubt
that confronting these two major sects

540
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:31,390
will put ourselves in peril.

541
00:30:32,270 --> 00:30:34,530
I won't let your lives be ended so easily.

542
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:40,750
When fighting those martial sects
of the Central Plain,

543
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,480
I'll make the best use of my wit.

544
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:45,340
Master, you're a marvelous strategist.

545
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,880
We await your instructions.

546
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,940
The spies planted in the martial sects

547
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,540
of the Central Plain
by the Power Gang years ago

548
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,600
are finally coming in handy.

549
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,820
Junior, calm down.

550
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,100
[Leader of Hengshan Sect, White Guanyin]
[Mo Yanxia]

551
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:39,860
It's Mo Yanxia, White Guanyin?

552
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,980
Many thanks for your help, Leader Mo.

553
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:45,400
Hengshan Sect sees it as its duty

554
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,530
to purge the martial world of the evil.

555
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:48,880
Good!

556
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,720
Now that you're inviting trouble
and having a death wish,

557
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:53,630
don't blame us for showing you no mercy.

558
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:54,880
The sea of suffering is boundless.

559
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,940
Where is the shore?

560
00:31:56,090 --> 00:31:57,690
It's better to avoid killing

561
00:31:58,030 --> 00:31:59,720
wherever conditions permit.

562
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:24,920
[Leader of Shaolin Sect]
[Tianzheng]

563
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:24,320
Amitabha.

564
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,990
Master.

565
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,310
Master Tianzheng's Finger of Vicissitudes

566
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,170
truly lives up to its reputation.

567
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,710
You have committed grave sins

568
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,510
by taking so many lives.

569
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,840
Put down your weapons already

570
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:50,240
and repent for your evil deeds.

571
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,400
Old monk,

572
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,210
why don't you just mind your own business?

573
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,920
Will Shaolin Sect stay out of this matter

574
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,720
if I give you this?

575
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,280
[Shaolin Sect, Baoxiang]
[Shaolin Sect, Longhu]

576
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:02,880
It's the Mind Sutra.

577
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,040
That's right.

578
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:07,830
This is the Mind Sutra
written by Damo himself—

579
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,750
a priceless treasure in Buddhism.

580
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,920
We'd like to gift it to Shaolin Sect.

581
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,400
It would be a huge shame for all Buddhists

582
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:17,030
if such a precious item
went missing again.

583
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,780
This sutra is indeed highly valuable
for Buddhism.

584
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:26,160
But upholding justice for the Xiao family
takes precedence over it.

585
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:28,920
In that case,

586
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,400
I'll destroy it then.

587
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,960
Still intact.

588
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,950
You obviously can't bring yourself
to see it get ruined.

589
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:03,250
This is the authentic Mind Sutra.

590
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,240
Though to plot against me,

591
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:08,190
you hid poisonous bugs in it,

592
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,040
it'd still be a pity
to let it go to rack and ruin.

593
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,830
So you did figure out its secret.

594
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,920
[Mind Sutra]

595
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,489
What powerful poisonous bugs.

596
00:34:20,590 --> 00:34:21,840
It takes some energy

597
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:23,550
to kill them.

598
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:44,920
Red Phoenix.

599
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:45,920
Master!

600
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:49,830
-Master!
-Master Tianzheng!
-Master Tianzheng!

601
00:34:54,989 --> 00:34:56,790
It seems I'm still one step late.

602
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,360
Your Finger of Vicissitudes
is impressive, old monk.

603
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,560
But I've finally managed to injure you.

604
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:05,720
I put all my strength

605
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,470
into that strike I threw at you.

606
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,290
Old monk, that was too much

607
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,700
even for you, right?

608
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,190
Amitabha.

609
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:17,840
Master,

610
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:19,670
I'm going to kill all of them!

611
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,600
-Junior!
-Baoxiang.

612
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:23,880
The qi in you is overwhelming.

613
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,590
To avoid going to the extreme,

614
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,400
you must not fight again.

615
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,710
Yes, Master.

616
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,800
Master Tianzheng is highly revered
in the martial world.

617
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,710
You're trying to kill him
in broad daylight.

618
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:37,840
Don't you fear Shaolin Sect

619
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,000
will see the Power Gang
as its mortal enemy?

620
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,600
Fear?

621
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,070
I think it will be Shaolin, Wudang, and Emei Sects

622
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:46,070
that fear making an enemy
of the Power Gang.

623
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:47,130
Are you attempting

624
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,570
to plunge the entire Daxi martial world
into chaos?

625
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,890
Then let's have a match

626
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:55,050
and find out who has the reign
of the martial world.

627
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,340
You think we're intimidated by you lot?

628
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:03,880
Kill them!

629
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,860
[Master Taichan]
[Leader of Wudang Sect]

630
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,550
Taichan, there you are.

631
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,880
How very nice.

632
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,360
Tianzheng,

633
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,920
look at you, being reduced to such a state

634
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,450
by these younger fighters.

635
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,170
You don't seem to have made much progress.

636
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:46,990
Tianzheng,

637
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,330
you're injured.

638
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,460
I'll help you heal.

639
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:51,030
When your condition gets better,

640
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,110
we'll join forces.

641
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:56,000
This young crowd from the Power Gang
can't be a threat to us.

642
00:36:57,630 --> 00:36:59,230
Amitabha.

643
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:02,110
Master Tianzheng's internal injuries
seem severe.

644
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,070
How can he stabilize his condition
right here?

645
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:04,880
Tianzheng is able to do it,

646
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,140
though others may not.

647
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:08,630
His Finger of Vicissitudes not only kills

648
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,590
those who touch it,

649
00:37:09,590 --> 00:37:10,920
but also heals injuries

650
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,550
and revives the dead if used properly.

651
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:14,360
Tianzheng, I'll help you heal.

652
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,880
Then, let's team up

653
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,340
and have an awesome fight.

654
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,550
What a good idea.

655
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,220
Sect Leader Mo,

656
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,260
I'll leave these guys to you.

657
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,320
Come on.

658
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:50,560
Young lady, you're not half bad.

659
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,680
You actually managed to survive

660
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,290
my Waterfall Sword Strike.

661
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,320
But I still advise you

662
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,440
to simply retreat.

663
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,360
Wudang Sect
is known for its defensive skills.

664
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,590
If I am to leave Tianzheng unattended

665
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:02,800
and to end your lives one by one,

666
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,660
it won't be quite easy indeed.

667
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:06,480
But I suggest you never think of

668
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,890
breaking in and attacking us,

669
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,860
if you aren't as good as Crazy Yan.

670
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,930
We are certainly no match for you.

671
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,630
Nonetheless,

672
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,840
you two have both been poisoned.

673
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:28,000
It's the Energy Suppressing Powder?

674
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,800
That's right.

675
00:40:29,070 --> 00:40:31,150
It's exactly
Wu Kuyu's Energy Suppressing Powder.

676
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:35,350
I'm afraid you'll find it difficult
to pool the internal energy inside you.

677
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,200
This devious little trick

678
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,700
can hardly harm me and...

679
00:40:46,510 --> 00:40:47,030
Master!

680
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:47,850
Tianzheng!

681
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,590
What is going on?

682
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:58,590
It's the sutra.

683
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,110
Master Tianzheng,
when you grabbed the Mind Sutra,

684
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:09,630
you killed the poisonous bugs
with your Finger of Vicissitudes, right?

685
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:12,150
Those were Radiant Algae Bugs.

686
00:41:12,710 --> 00:41:14,880
When you killed them
with your Finger of Vicissitudes,

687
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,540
they became algae powder
attaching to the book,

688
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:20,150
and was later transferred to your hand,
Master.

689
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,230
When you used your Finger of Vicissitudes
to heal your wounds,

690
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,370
they were revived
by the miraculous power in it,

691
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:27,570
transformed back into bugs,
and then went into your body.

692
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,000
As Master Taichan helped you heal,

693
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,670
the bugs naturally moved

694
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:33,270
into Master Taichan's body.

695
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:36,150
We sacrificed so many lives
in the previous attacks

696
00:41:36,150 --> 00:41:37,880
just to make you two
use your inner energy,

697
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:39,760
so that the bugs could be activated.

698
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:43,090
If it hadn't been for
the old monk's Finger of Vicissitudes,

699
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:47,040
these bugs wouldn't have
kicked into effect.

700
00:41:49,630 --> 00:41:50,960
You despicable people!

701
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,760
It turns out you knew
I'd come here in the first place.

702
00:41:55,150 --> 00:41:57,710
You did all that stuff just to trap me.

703
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,550
Amitabha.

704
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:03,330
Father, Mother!

705
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,150
The Power Gang?

706
00:42:20,090 --> 00:42:20,740
Qiushui!

707
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:28,590
Qiushui!
