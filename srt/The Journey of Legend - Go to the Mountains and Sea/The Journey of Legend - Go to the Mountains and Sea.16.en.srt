[The Journey of Legend]

2
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,910
[Episode 16]

3
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,880
You're really calculating.

4
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:51,000
Have you ever calculated

5
00:01:52,509 --> 00:01:53,820
when you'll die?

6
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,790
I'm not interested in arguing with you.

7
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,520
If you want a quick death,

8
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:13,150
tell me what I want to know.

9
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,079
I don't have time for this.

10
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:21,240
You're a dying man.

11
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,190
Be smart

12
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,560
and give me the Hero Command Token.

13
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,040
I'll consider giving you a quick death.

14
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,630
Do you dare to kill me?

15
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:01,080
Xueyu.

16
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,360
Yiren.

17
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,860
Where are Mr. Qu and the others?

18
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:07,360
Xueyu.

19
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,980
Qu Hanshan really is the Sword King.

20
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,010
Qiushui was…

21
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,600
Xiaoyi.

22
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,400
Qiushui…

23
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,450
What exactly happened?

24
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,030
Qiushui risked his life

25
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:30,770
to prevent us from being deceived

26
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,400
by Qu Hanshan

27
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,910
and was struck down.

28
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,290
How could this happen?

29
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,870
Where is Qiushui?

30
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:44,940
Where is he now?

31
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,630
Xueyu.

32
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,910
I must find him.

33
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,000
I can surely heal him.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,460
Xueyu, don't be reckless.

35
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,000
Qiushui kept telling us

36
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,920
to return to the Sword Manor
as soon as possible.

37
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,920
We cannot let his efforts be in vain.

38
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,390
That's right.

39
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,680
Now is not the time for grief.

40
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:08,240
Kaiyan has gone ahead to scout

41
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,240
according to Qiushui's tactical map.

42
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,280
Once he returns,

43
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,020
we'll leave immediately.

44
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:14,470
Yiren is right.

45
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:15,720
We'll leave very soon.

46
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,649
We can't delay any longer.

47
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,850
What about Qiushui?

48
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:25,870
Is Kaiyan back?

49
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,380
No,

50
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,130
it's a group of people.

51
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,120
Qu Hanshan's men are coming after us!

52
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,380
Everyone, be careful!

53
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,930
Still trying to play the hero.

54
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:03,570
The Hero Command Token

55
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,300
has nothing to do with you, Xiao Qiushui.

56
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,110
Why cling to it?

57
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,730
The token has nothing to do with me,

58
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,770
but you won't get it either.

59
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,870
Quite stubborn, aren't you?

60
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,320
Seems you haven't starved enough yet.

61
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,770
I already accepted death
in Top Fairness Forest.

62
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:23,920
Why am I…

63
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:26,880
Now I need to stall him

64
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,160
to buy Yiren time
to return to the Huanhua Sect,

65
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,290
which might change how the story ends.

66
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:43,320
If you're afraid I'll starve to death,

67
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,930
you should unseal my acupoints first.

68
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,720
Giving in so quickly?

69
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,520
I doubt you're sincere.

70
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,980
Don't believe me then.

71
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,600
The Hero Command Token
is useless to me anyway.

72
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,880
Is everyone alright? Anyone hurt?

73
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,270
Xiaoyi.

74
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,580
How are you?

75
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,850
Are you okay?

76
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:31,920
How are you?

77
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,240
I'm fine, Xueyu.

78
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,970
My meridians aren't damaged.

79
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:35,560
Good.

80
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:39,040
Qu Hanshan actually set up an ambush here.

81
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,440
There must be more pursuers.

82
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,480
We shouldn't stay here long.

83
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,070
Yiren, Xueyu,

84
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,630
bad news.

85
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:57,909
What is it?

86
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,190
The Power Gang discovered
that Qiushui stole the map,

87
00:07:02,190 --> 00:07:03,920
and they changed the ambush location.

88
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,750
The shortest route for reinforcements

89
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,480
is now blocked by fallen rocks.

90
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,640
Several of our men were killed by them.

91
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,750
Blockade ahead, pursuers behind.

92
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:12,750
What should we do?

93
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,480
In that case,

94
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,950
we have to make a detour

95
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:17,150
to the Diancang Sect.

96
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,930
Father has long-standing ties
with the Diancang Sect.

97
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:21,930
Besides, if we head northwest,

98
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,430
we can evade the pursuers
sent by Qu Hanshan.

99
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:25,890
I'm sorry for the trouble,

100
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,480
but we'll head northwest immediately

101
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,680
to the Diancang Sect.

102
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,680
-Yes!
-Okay.

103
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,800
Are you ever going to stop eating?

104
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,310
Where is the Hero Command Token?

105
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:56,560
What's the rush?

106
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,360
I have to say,

107
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,960
your cooking is really good.

108
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,700
Why aren't you eating?

109
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,770
I thought you were clever,

110
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,180
that there was
something special about you.

111
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:17,290
But you can't even figure out
why I'm not eating.

112
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:19,480
You're nothing but a useless fool.

113
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,470
I know—

114
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,640
you poisoned the meat.

115
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,720
When I set Qu Hanshan up,

116
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,270
I never expected to live in this world.

117
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:37,000
I don't know what you were thinking.

118
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,440
Maybe you hit your head?

119
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,390
You brought me back here against my will.

120
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,150
Listen,

121
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,560
this poison means nothing to me.

122
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:49,910
Do you know this poison
is called the Seven Perils Poison?

123
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,960
If you try any tricks,

124
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,040
I'll activate this poison,

125
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:56,150
and you'll be in excruciating pain,

126
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,750
as if countless ants are
gnawing at your veins.

127
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,030
Actually, Old Madam Wu

128
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:16,720
never told me

129
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:18,550
where the Hero Command Token is.

130
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,940
Before I parted with Old Madam Wu,

131
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,210
she asked me to find Crazy Yan's family

132
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,390
to fulfill her wish.

133
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,840
That's all.

134
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,840
That's all I know.

135
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,170
You have to play it the hard way.

136
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,920
Thank you for the meal.

137
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,160
You summoned me, Master?

138
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,260
Where is the Snake Duo?

139
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,000
They've already gone to the Diancang Sect.

140
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,840
Follow them.

141
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,120
You want me to assist them

142
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,920
in investigating the Marching…

143
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,090
I want you to follow them

144
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:51,310
so the Snake Duo
won't become Qu Hanshan's lackeys

145
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,950
like Purple Phoenix did.

146
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:54,360
Yes.

147
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:57,660
I ordered them
to secretly look into the Marching Pill.

148
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,060
If they step out of line,

149
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,790
consider them traitors.

150
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,540
You've been tortured
by ant venom for 12 hours.

151
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,900
You're tougher than I expected.

152
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,600
Liu Suifeng.

153
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:04,270
If I ever get the chance,

154
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:08,840
I will definitely kill you.

155
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,580
You think you're capable of that?

156
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,410
You've lost all your martial arts skills,

157
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:17,120
and you're poisoned with ant venom.

158
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,360
No one can save you now.

159
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,660
Rest assured.

160
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:25,150
I certainly will.

161
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,220
Delusional.

162
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,910
Liu Suifeng,

163
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,030
come out here!

164
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,670
I thought someone came to save that loser.

165
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,770
Turns out it's the Sword King.

166
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,840
Liu Suifeng.

167
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,270
I know he's in your hands.

168
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:20,630
So what if you know?

169
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,020
Hand him over to me,

170
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,320
and I'll let this go.

171
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,360
Let this go?

172
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,970
You mean the spies you sent?

173
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:32,840
You turned Purple Phoenix
and Kang Chuyu against me.

174
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,680
I haven't settled that score with you yet.

175
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,910
Seems like you and I

176
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:42,600
still can't see eye to eye.

177
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,690
If that's the case,

178
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,720
don't blame me for taking him by force.

179
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,750
Qu Hanshan,

180
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,320
Xiao Qiushui has what Chief wants.

181
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:27,580
Are you trying to let him escape?

182
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:29,360
Liu Suifeng,

183
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,000
do you really think Xiao Qiushui

184
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,400
would just sit in that room
waiting for you?

185
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,050
Xilou, have some water.

186
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,770
Any news from Qiushui?

187
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,490
I'm not drinking it.

188
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:33,440
You drink it.

189
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,750
You haven't had a drop of water
for a full day and night.

190
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,960
You can't survive on meditation alone.

191
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:43,750
We're in our darkest hour now.

192
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,840
Despite all the people fighting with us,

193
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,680
we still ended up in this predicament.

194
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,330
If reinforcements still don't come,

195
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,870
I, Xiao Xilou,

196
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,550
will risk my life

197
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,790
to lead our disciples
out through the siege

198
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:08,050
and fight to the death.

199
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,150
Shan,

200
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:19,430
I leave Junior Meng and the others to you.

201
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,390
Don't talk like that.

202
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,440
Qiushui has gone for help.

203
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:29,390
He's so clever.

204
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,370
He'll surely come back.

205
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,550
Qiushui, our Qiushui,

206
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,240
among all your siblings,

207
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,000
you're the smartest.

208
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:50,720
I know

209
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
you won't let me down.

210
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,270
You won't.

211
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,730
Why didn't you praise him to his face?

212
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,820
You were always scolding him.

213
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,440
The children of the Xiao family—

214
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:16,510
not just our 3 children,

215
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,160
but all our disciples—

216
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:22,069
they are the hope of the Xiao family.

217
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:26,000
If we can keep them safe this time,

218
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:31,880
the future of our Huanhua Sect is secure.

219
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,880
Here, drink some water first.

220
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,400
You drink it. Be good.

221
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,920
It's so sweet.

222
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:06,640
Here.

223
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,060
Alright, alright.

224
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:10,500
Drink.

225
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,140
[Diancang Sect]

226
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,850
Now that the Diancang Sect is dealt with,

227
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,310
Liu Suifeng
will never be able to explain himself.

228
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,020
I deliberately left a few survivors.

229
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,370
Deputy Chief Liu's crime

230
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,440
of slaughtering martial sects at will

231
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,440
is now undeniable.

232
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,400
Since ancient times,
humans have always been…

233
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,480
the most vicious creatures.

234
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,240
Snake.

235
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,110
Snake.

236
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:32,960
Snake.

237
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:34,160
Snake.

238
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,000
It was Liu Suifeng.

239
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:37,750
The Diancang Sect…

240
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,090
He's from the Diancang Sect.

241
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:54,790
Yiren,

242
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,310
this snake venom is extremely rare.

243
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,770
It belongs to the Snake Duo
of the Power Gang.

244
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:02,640
Looks like something's happened
to the Diancang Sect.

245
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,840
Mr. Zuoqiu, Mr. Deng,

246
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:07,000
the Diancang Sect is
about 10 li up the mountain.

247
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,240
Please take the shortcut
to check things out.

248
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,720
If there are any survivors,

249
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,720
please help them.

250
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,200
Alright, Mr. Xiao.

251
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,400
You be careful too.

252
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,000
Farewell.

253
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:15,880
Let's join them.

254
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,360
Okay.

255
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,590
[Diancang Sect]

256
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,930
It really was the Snake Duo.

257
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,110
Watch out!

258
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,350
Let me see.

259
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:18,240
Everyone, be careful.

260
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,900
The snake blood is poisonous.

261
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,810
How dare you kill my snake?

262
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,570
You really have a death wish.

263
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,640
Power Gang?

264
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,550
Since we've met here,

265
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,700
I won't let you off easily!

266
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,400
Shinian!

267
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,270
Interesting.

268
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:12,790
You actually think you can trap me
with a deceptive formation.

269
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,720
Let's see

270
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:15,490
if your formation can kill

271
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,250
every last one of my snakes.

272
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,070
Yiren,

273
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,250
someone else is coming.

274
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,820
[Zu Jindian, Fire King of the Power Gang]

275
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,330
That's it for today.

276
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,920
Who'd be out here
in the middle of nowhere?

277
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:29,570
Don't give up yet.

278
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,880
Didn't we find 4 yesterday?

279
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:33,090
[The Four Thugs: Yuwen Dong,
Chang Wuqi, Meng Donglin, Jin Beiwang]

280
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,140
T-That was yesterday.

281
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:34,260
That thing.

282
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,310
That white thing.

283
00:23:37,510 --> 00:23:38,310
It's a person.

284
00:23:38,510 --> 00:23:39,310
It's a person.

285
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,720
Hurry! Let's go! We hit the jackpot!

286
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,540
We hit the jackpot.

287
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,260
He's dead. We'll get paid.

288
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,540
Put him in the bag.

289
00:23:50,590 --> 00:23:52,190
Hurry! We're gonna get paid.

290
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,270
He's alive, Beiwang.

291
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:55,000
What did you do?

292
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:55,640
He's alive.

293
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,650
That's against our rule.

294
00:23:56,650 --> 00:23:58,380
We only make money off the dead.

295
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,180
How did you touch him
and bring him back to life?

296
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,110
If he's alive, we won't earn any coins.

297
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:05,640
Exactly!

298
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,300
I... I...

299
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,390
Let's throw him back in the river
to feed the fish!

300
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:10,250
Throw him back!

301
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:14,050
Let go of me.

302
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,940
My foot hurts too much.

303
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,480
Misters,

304
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,350
you went through all that trouble
to save me.

305
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:24,630
Why are you trying to kill me again?

306
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,440
-You…
-Cut the crap.

307
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,200
We, the Four Thugs,
have only fished out dead bodies,

308
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,160
never living people.

309
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,920
That's right.

310
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,320
We make a living
by retrieving dead bodies.

311
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,200
You were dead
and suddenly came back to life.

312
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,110
That's bad luck.

313
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,170
Bad luck, bad luck!

314
00:24:41,110 --> 00:24:42,640
Stop wasting time with him.

315
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,080
Before anyone finds out,

316
00:24:44,190 --> 00:24:46,450
throw him back in the river and drown him.

317
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,820
He'll be dead in an hour.

318
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,790
Then we'll fish him out and haul him back.

319
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:54,070
Good idea!

320
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,550
It hurts.

321
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,590
Misters,

322
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,510
can I say something?

323
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:00,510
Just a quick word.

324
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,960
Here's the thing.

325
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,230
Think about it—

326
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,250
making money off the living

327
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,750
is faster than making money off the dead,

328
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,000
right?

329
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,510
Impossible.

330
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,730
Impossible.

331
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,840
The authorities told us

332
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,280
that we get 500 coins for each body.

333
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:25,400
N-No. Isn't it 100…

334
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,160
If he's alive, we won't get a reward.

335
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,960
Right. No reward.

336
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:36,970
How about this?

337
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,000
I'll give you

338
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:39,690
the reward.

339
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:40,960
Who do you think you are?

340
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,510
Exactly!

341
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,440
Why should we trust you?

342
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,480
Yeah. Why should we believe you?

343
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:43,790
Yes.

344
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:45,690
Exactly. Why should we trust you?

345
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:50,920
I think the Huanhua Sect's villa
isn't far from here.

346
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:52,270
Misters,

347
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:55,510
just come with me and you'll see.

348
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,400
Huan... Huan...

349
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:58,680
Huanhua Sect?

350
00:25:59,270 --> 00:26:00,930
The Huanhua Sect of Jinzhong?

351
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,720
Judging by his age,

352
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:08,630
could he be the third son
of the Xiao family, Xiao Qiushui?

353
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:10,990
Xiao Qiushui?

354
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:14,530
Xiao Qiushui!

355
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:15,830
I…

356
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,200
Xiao Qiushui?

357
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,520
You've got the wrong person.

358
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:24,790
I'm not Xiao Qiushui.

359
00:26:25,070 --> 00:26:27,920
Xiao Qiushui's men
killed the Three Heroes.

360
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,350
Right.

361
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,550
He is Xiao Qiushui.

362
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:30,270
Yes, that's him.

363
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:30,920
That's him.

364
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,550
-It's him!
-His men killed the Three Heroes.

365
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,920
We're their good friends.

366
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:34,830
The one who killed them

367
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,960
is our enemy.

368
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,240
-Right.
-Kill him!

369
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:37,830
Kill him!

370
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,830
Wait, wait.

371
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,550
Misters,

372
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,510
what are you talking about?

373
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,110
I'm really not Xiao Qiushui.

374
00:26:44,310 --> 00:26:45,550
How could I possibly have killed

375
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:46,480
your friends?

376
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,280
I don't even know martial arts.

377
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,960
He said he didn't kill them.

378
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,550
Then he's not Xiao Qiushui.

379
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,810
Hold on.

380
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,720
Then why is he taking us
to the Huanhua Sect?

381
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,240
He's also offered us a reward.

382
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,030
Y-Yeah.

383
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,110
It's him!

384
00:26:59,310 --> 00:26:59,960
Oh no.

385
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,030
The Three Heroes of Long River are
characters in the original novel.

386
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,270
At the beginning of the story,

387
00:27:03,270 --> 00:27:04,640
they were killed by Xiao Qiushui.

388
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,170
According to the timeline,

389
00:27:07,030 --> 00:27:08,750
I hadn't come into this world

390
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,070
to become Xiao Qiushui then.

391
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,200
-It's him!
-Kill him!

392
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,920
Kill him first!

393
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,240
Right, kill him first!

394
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,720
If we kill him

395
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:16,720
after saving him,

396
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,620
are we saving him or killing him?

397
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,140
Cut the crap, Donglin.

398
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,840
I remember now! I remember!

399
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:25,250
W-What did you just say?

400
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:26,510
The Three…

401
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,790
Three Heroes!

402
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,450
Yes, right, the Three Heroes.

403
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:31,480
The Three Heroes

404
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,760
were all great at martial arts.

405
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,680
My martial arts skills are ordinary.

406
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,310
So tell me,

407
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:38,440
how could I possibly have killed them?

408
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,290
I-I don't believe you.

409
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,790
-Me neither.
-We don't believe you.

410
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:43,650
Think about it,

411
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,070
how many people are the Three Heroes?

412
00:27:45,070 --> 00:27:46,200
T-Three.

413
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:47,440
Three against 1—

414
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,510
how could they possibly have lost to me?

415
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,240
Besides,

416
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,440
how many of you are there?

417
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,310
Four.

418
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,350
More people means more strength.

419
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,350
If you don't stick together,

420
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,920
how can you make a living as a team?

421
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,640
Am I right?

422
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,070
-That makes sense.
-That makes sense.

423
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:00,880
No, it doesn't!

424
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,590
Why not?

425
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,940
Could the 4 of us
defeat the Three Heroes?

426
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
If we couldn't defeat the Three Heroes,

427
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,440
then we definitely can't defeat him.

428
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,790
So which is better,

429
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:09,510
more people or fewer people?

430
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,840
More people, of course!

431
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,550
Donglin…

432
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,960
Kill him first!

433
00:28:18,590 --> 00:28:19,680
I'm done talking to you.

434
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,830
This matter is really too complicated.

435
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,090
Let me explain slowly.

436
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,310
When the Three Heroes died,

437
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,960
I wasn't even in this world,

438
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,640
and I wasn't Xiao Qiushui at all.

439
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,440
Why do you have to kill me?

440
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,680
I just don't understand

441
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,010
why you're so stubborn.

442
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:32,880
No.

443
00:28:33,270 --> 00:28:34,160
It was a year ago.

444
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:35,880
The Three Heroes died 1 year ago.

445
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,880
He said he wasn't in this world then.

446
00:28:38,030 --> 00:28:39,830
Does he look like he's 1 year old?

447
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,080
Am I cursed or something?

448
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,780
Stop wasting time with him.

449
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,150
If we keep listening to him,

450
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:49,160
we'll all be fooled.

451
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,420
Yes! He'll fool us all!

452
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,810
-Beiwang.
-Beiwang.

453
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:53,350
-Kill him first.
-Kill him first.

454
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:53,750
Do it.

455
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,710
What are you going to do?

456
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:56,350
Stay back.

457
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,270
-Kill him!
-Wait.

458
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:06,400
The Three Heroes were killed
by Xiao Qiushui's men:

459
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,070
one by saber, one by sword,
and one by hidden weapons.

460
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,440
How should we kill him

461
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,320
to avenge the Three Heroes?

462
00:29:13,110 --> 00:29:14,000
Y-You're so annoying.

463
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,260
How should we kill him?

464
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,920
He has 2 hands and 2 feet.

465
00:29:18,270 --> 00:29:19,270
Chop them all off.

466
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,550
We each get one

467
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,200
for revenge.

468
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:23,000
Chop them off.

469
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,810
Don't touch him.

470
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,200
Yiren!

471
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,400
Xueyu, watch out!

472
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,240
Master really foresaw this.

473
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,050
The Snake Duo not only betrayed him

474
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:39,200
but also colluded with Zu Jindian,
the Fire King.

475
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,260
Looks like they're determined
to side with Qu Hanshan.

476
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:48,510
Xueyu!

477
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,400
Yiren!

478
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,350
Retreat!

479
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,410
I'll cover you.

480
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,550
Shinian!

481
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:02,920
Protect Yiren!

482
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:04,000
Young Master Yiren,

483
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,960
go!

484
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:05,840
Shinian!

485
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,590
Go, Yiren!

486
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,440
Young Master Yiren, go!

487
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:23,920
Go!

488
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,030
Come at me if you dare!

489
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,650
Red Phoenix,

490
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,550
why are you
turning against your own people?

491
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:52,070
Master sent you
to investigate the Diancang Sect,

492
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:54,160
yet you wiped it out on your own.

493
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,160
You've even colluded with the Sword King.

494
00:31:57,160 --> 00:31:58,680
Of course I have to kill you.

495
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,960
If that's the case,

496
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,270
I won't hold back anymore!

497
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:14,110
Xiao Qiushui… He's still alive.

498
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,600
Young Master Yiren,
we should be safe here.

499
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,030
I spent years training Shinian.

500
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:33,850
They've sacrificed themselves
for the Xiao family,

501
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,530
and I couldn't even protect their bodies.

502
00:32:37,550 --> 00:32:40,200
The Xiao family helped a lot of people,

503
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:42,150
but now we've landed in hot water

504
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,440
and ended up like this.

505
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:47,640
Why?

506
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,880
Why?

507
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,880
We've already lost Qiushui.

508
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:58,480
Is the Xiao family destined to fall?

509
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:04,790
Yiren.

00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,550

Qiushui is dead?

512
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,280

♪ Gazing at the moon
at the end of the world ♪

558
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:03,360
It was his last wish.

559
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:09,990
♪ Tears fall unrestrained;
the leaves are unswayed ♪

560
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:06,920
Yiren,

561
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,320
we can't let Qiushui die in vain.

562
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:18,530
♪ As the flowers fall,
my heart falls with them ♪

563
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:11,880
Now,

564
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,280
our parents' lives are
hanging by a thread.

565
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,450
Kaiyan got separated from us.

566
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,760
It's up to us now

567
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,090
to save the Xiao family.

568
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,410
You must pull yourself together.

569
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:19,710
It hurts.

570
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,480
-Are you okay?
-It hurts.

571
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,030
Liu Suifeng!

572
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,440
Damn you, Liu Suifeng.

573
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:25,030
Listen,

574
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,890
we work for Zhu the Great King.

575
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,710
Yeah.

576
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,110
Hurt us again, and we'll…

577
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,770
Stop playing dead.

578
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:46,250
My poison only attacks your meridians.

579
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,190
You can still talk.

580
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,470
You beast!

581
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:00,990
You might as well kill me.

582
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,560
That's right.

583
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,510
Fine.

584
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:08,970
I'll give you
until 3 incense sticks burn out.

585
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,360
Once they do,

586
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,190
I'll break their arms and legs.

587
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:15,410
Wait, wait!

588
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,800
There are 4 of us.

589
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,880
If you light 3 incense sticks,

590
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,480
that will leave 1 person out.

591
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,480
Right, exactly.

592
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:27,510
Donglin.

593
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,760
Donglin, Donglin.

594
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,630
It hurts!

595
00:37:29,630 --> 00:37:30,150
You...

596
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:30,920
I...

597
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,090
Liu Suifeng!

598
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,160
Now the numbers match up.

599
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,840
Why don't you just break his limbs

600
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,070
and force him to talk?

601
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:42,280
Yeah, break his limbs.

602
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,080
That's right.

603
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,680
These 4 people
have nothing to do with this.

604
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,130
It's so despicable

605
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,670
of you to do this.

606
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,230
Mr. Xiao,

607
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,460
if you can't bear
to see these people suffer,

608
00:38:00,590 --> 00:38:01,790
then think carefully

609
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,840
about where the Hero Command Token is.

610
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,240
My kneecap!

611
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,130
Stop it.

612
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,960
-Stop it!
-Just tell him!

613
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,480
Yeah, tell him.

614
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,630
My leg!

615
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:01,160
Just tell him!

616
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,670
-My leg!
-Hurry up!

617
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:04,710
Master.

618
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:19,500
You guessed right, Master.

619
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,150
The Snake Duo wiped out the Diancang Sect

620
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,350
and framed you for it.

621
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,030
They also conspired with the Fire King,
who works for the Sword King.

622
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,320
Xiao Yiren, the eldest son
of the Xiao family,

623
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,840
was rushing back to the Sword Manor
with Shinian

624
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,760
and encountered
the Snake Duo and Fire King.

625
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:31,760
During the fight,

626
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,480
2 of their prized Shinian

627
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,960
were killed.

628
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,030
What about those traitors, the Snake Duo?

629
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,190
I fought 3 of them alone

630
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:39,450
and killed 1 of the duo.

631
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:42,290
But I didn't let them get away easily.

632
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,680
I took Shinian's tokens.

633
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,400
They can help you force Xiao Qiushui

634
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,270
to reveal where the Hero Command Token is.

635
00:39:49,270 --> 00:39:50,800
That's an unexpected gain.

636
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:52,920
You may go.

637
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,360
Yes.

638
00:40:04,070 --> 00:40:07,000
-Damn you, Liu Suifeng!
-Xiao Qiushui, you bastard!

639
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,420
Xiao Qiushui!

640
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,150
Xiao Qiushui!

641
00:40:13,190 --> 00:40:14,280
What should we do now?

642
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,680
Look at our broken limbs.

643
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:19,150
We Four Thugs

644
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,280
are each hobbling on one leg now.

645
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,780
It's all your fault!

646
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,320
Yes! It's all your fault.

647
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,440
Bro,

648
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,960
could you get your hand off my thigh?

649
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:34,300
You've got a mouth
harder to crack than a stone.

650
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,230
-So tight-lipped.
-Yeah.

651
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:35,960
E-Exactly!

652
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,440
Just say it.

653
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,000
Tell me where the token is.

654
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,550
Otherwise, when Liu Suifeng lights
3 more incense sticks,

655
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:43,750
it'll be our heads that get chopped off.

656
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,510
Hurry up and tell me where it is.

657
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,440
Where's the token?

658
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,070
Where's the token?

659
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:47,590
Wait.

660
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:48,880
Wait.

661
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,980
Guys, I'll talk. I'll talk.

662
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,110
Guys,

663
00:40:52,110 --> 00:40:54,640
I'm truly sorry
for getting you all involved.

664
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,590
Guys,

665
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,290
actually,

666
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,000
I really don't know
where the Hero Command Token is.

667
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,330
He says he doesn't know.

668
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,440
He says
he doesn't have the Hero Command Token.

669
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,170
If you ask me,

670
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:05,210
we should break his limbs too.

671
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,360
Even if he doesn't confess,

672
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:07,610
at least it'll feel fair.

673
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,440
Make it fair.

674
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:09,040
Right.

675
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:11,070
-I'll hit him here.
-Right, right.

676
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:11,920
I'll hit him here.

677
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,580
Wait, wait.

678
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:13,470
I'll tell you!

679
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,150
What is there to tell?

680
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,440
Just listen to me for a second.

681
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,920
You're driving me crazy with your noise!

682
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,880
Let me ask you this:

683
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,410
what does Liu Suifeng want?

684
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:22,110
He wants the Hero Command Token.

685
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:23,150
I've told you 10,000 times

686
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,440
I don't have the Hero Command Token!

687
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:24,960
No way!

688
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,440
So what does he want?

689
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,280
I don't have the token!

690
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,840
Without it, he'll kill us all.

691
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,800
So I'm asking you:

692
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,710
what should we do now?

693
00:41:30,710 --> 00:41:31,610
Stick together.

694
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,780
Figure out a way to break free

695
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:34,840
and kill him.

696
00:41:37,030 --> 00:41:37,630
Right!

697
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:38,710
Wuqi, he's right!

698
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,920
Not at all.

699
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,440
-Right my ass!
-Wrong!

700
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:41,920
Wrong!

701
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:43,110
Wrong!

702
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,480
We'll die anyway.

703
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,400
I might as well die alongside you!

704
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,860
Stop pulling me, will you?

705
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:51,260
I've had enough of this.

706
00:41:58,120 --> 00:41:58,920
Liu Suifeng!

707
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:01,730
Be careful.

708
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,630
His life is worth more than all of yours.

709
00:42:09,950 --> 00:42:11,150
You may not care about

710
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:12,980
these 4 men's lives.

711
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:16,270
But what about these people?

712
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:48,480
Where did you get these tokens?

713
00:42:50,590 --> 00:42:52,320
What have you done to my family?

714
00:42:54,190 --> 00:42:55,920
What I've done doesn't matter.

715
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:58,070
Think about what you should do.
