[The Journey of Legend]

2
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,940
[Episode 1]

3
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,500
In the early years of Daxi,

4
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,880
chaos spread across the martial world.

5
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,680
The righteous sects declined,

6
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:53,280
while the Power Gang,
the biggest sect in the martial world,

7
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,590
dominated the scene.

8
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,710
And Zhu the Great King of the Water Sect

9
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,710
held unchallenged control
over the waterways.

10
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:03,240
The two sects
were locked in fierce conflict.

11
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,150
The Beihuang Army was wreaking havoc.

12
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,840
The shadow of the southern migration
still lingers.

13
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,240
The emperor was forced
to flee the capital.

14
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,360
[Jinzhong]

15
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,240
Meanwhile,

16
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,800
the Hero Command Token, long lost

17
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,190
to the martial world, resurfaced.

18
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,590
It was said to contain
the ultimate treasure

19
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,870
in the martial world.

20
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,000
And it was in the hands
of the mother of Wu Jie,

21
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,030
the famous general of Daxi.

22
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,960
Martial artists everywhere
heard the news and sprang into action.

23
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,400
They set up ambushes along the way,

24
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,120
chasing Old Madam Wu
all the way to Jinzhong,

25
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,400
cornering her with no way out.

26
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:40,360
At this critical moment,

27
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,630
a young hero appeared.

28
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:44,520
He saved Old Madam Wu from the Water King

29
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,560
of the Power Gang.

30
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,560
He's Xiao Qiushui, Third Young Master

31
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,750
of Huanhua Sect.

32
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:52,750
Huanhua Sword Technique,
renowned for its agility,

33
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,000
had been mastered
by Xiao Qiushui to perfection.

34
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,630
With his immense internal energy

35
00:02:57,630 --> 00:02:59,360
and unmatched flying skill,

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,870
his sword strikes were swift like meteors

37
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:03,270
and powerful as thunder.

38
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,560
Wielding Changge Sword,

39
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,710
he singlehandedly defeated

40
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,520
the forces of the Power Gang.

41
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,590
That battle made him a legend.

42
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,310
I am Xiao Qiushui.

43
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:25,990
Greetings, Old Madam Wu.

44
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,200
Goog boy!

45
00:03:29,329 --> 00:03:32,180
[Xiao Qiushui, Huanhua Sectt]

46
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:42,680
Mingming.

47
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,079
Get up quickly.

48
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
How's "The Marvelous Heroes of Shenzhou"

49
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,540
you adapted with the Magic Codex?

50
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,240
I got you into a closed beta

51
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,240
to fulfill your martial arts fantasy.

52
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,120
With this Magic Codex,

53
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,280
you just need to set up
the key story points

54
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,560
and character profiles,

55
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,800
and the AI in its system

56
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,120
will finish

57
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,150
the story for you.

58
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:09,620
Welcome to the
Magic Codex Interactive Writing System.

59
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,560
Since we're adapting the setting,

60
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,160
the enhancements aren't enough.

61
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,750
The male lead has to be a top-tier master
from the very start.

62
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,600
His lightness skill,

63
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,600
internal energy,

64
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,600
and sword skill must all be the best.

65
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,000
He should not only be graceful
and handsome,

66
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,720
but also possess extraordinary talent,

67
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,980
making him a once-in-a-generation
martial arts prodigy.

68
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,020
By the age of 12,

69
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,040
he had already mastered the Xiao family's
Huanhua Sword Technique.

70
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,630
At 18,
he was personally taught by Crazy Yan,

71
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:42,920
who implanted
the Boiling Blood Cocoon in him—

72
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,159
which could unleash 600 years of power

73
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,600
at a critical moment.

74
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,800
At 20,

75
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,600
he accidentally discovered
the world's greatest martial arts manual,

76
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,800
the Voidheart Codex,

77
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,020
and mastered
an unparalleled sword technique.

78
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,530
He defeated the Power Gang

79
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,990
and Zhu the Great King,

80
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,080
and at just 20 years old,
became the leader

81
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,630
of the Martial Arts Alliance Leader,

82
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:03,430
leading his sworn brothers

83
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,920
and fellow martial artists
to march south and fight against

84
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,980
the Beihuang Army.

85
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,000
General Wu, moved by his righteousness,

86
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,910
presented him with the Hero Command Token.

87
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,160
From then on,
Xiao Qiushui ruled the martial world.

88
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,020
May you rule the martial world

89
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,770
for thousands of years!

90
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,730
May you rule the martial world

91
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:32,630
for thousands of years!

92
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,050
Standing at the pinnacle of life,

93
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,220
Xiao Qiushui felt great
being the protagonist.

94
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,430
He turned around, looking at the world,

95
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,830
and said six words—

96
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:43,960
No, wait—

97
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,960
it should be eight words:

98
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,250
I'm invincible in Shenzhou

99
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,330
yet lonely as snow.

100
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,510
User Xiao Mingming,

101
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,600
thank you for using the Magic Codex System

102
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,000
to adapt the novel
"the Marvelous Heroes of Shenzhou."

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,120
Would you like to integrate this project
into the system?

104
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,180
[This Magic Codex
that Li Cai gave me is pretty useful.]

105
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:05,680
Not bad, not bad.

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,870
System bug.

107
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,480
System bug.

108
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:20,830
Warning, the character's setting
is out of character.

109
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,720
Warning, the character's setting
is out of character.

110
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,050
Are you messing with me?

111
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,370

-Bravo!

This way, sir.

119
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,270
A table upstairs for one!

120
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,830
Yes, so beautiful.

-Bravo!
-Bravo!

00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,750
Come on, sir, this way.

126

Bravo!

127
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:32,510
-Thank you.
-That was excellent dancing.

128
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,909
You have good taste, sir.

129
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,789
Bravo!

130
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,120

131
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,000
-Third Young Master.
-Third Young Master.

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,600
Third Young Master, wake up.

133
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,220
Why isn't he waking up?

134
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,390
Why has he slept so long today?

135
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:49,910
Yes.

136
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,200
It's been so long,
and he's still not awake.

137

150
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,080
Thank goodness.

151
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,270
He's finally awakened.

152
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,510
Yes, finally.

153
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:14,790
Third Young Master,

154
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:15,920
does your head hurt?

155
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,820
How do you feel?

156
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,450
Third Young Master,

157
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:22,720
are you alright?

158
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,390
[What's going on here?]

159
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,480
[Where am I?]

160
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:35,620
Please have some water first.

161
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,200
Who are you guys? Where's Li Cai?

162
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,510
I got it.

163
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,370
You're the actresses he hired, right?

164
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,320
"Actress?" What are "actress?"

165
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:50,960
Yesterday,

166
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,790
you and your friends

167
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:53,450
picked this illegal gambling den

168
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,510
on this street to celebrate,

169
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,390
got drunk,

170
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,960
and you ended up resting here.

171
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,530
[Third Young Master?]

172
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,750
Could it be…

173
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,840
that because I watched
The Sword of the Third Young Master

174
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,300
the day before yesterday,

175
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,800
I'm having a dream about Xie Xiaofeng?

176
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,390
Why is this dream so weird?

177
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,870
Third Young Master, what's wrong?

178
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,130
Even the props look so real.

179
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,080
Is there a problem?

180
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,000
Oh my... It's so weird.

181
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:32,710
Third Young Master, what's the matter?

182
00:10:35,390 --> 00:10:37,600
This isn't right. Something's off.

183
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,070
[Xiao Qiushui]

184
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:00,840
Young Master Xiao...

185
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:01,670
Be careful.

186
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,800
What did you just say?

187
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:13,730
Young Master Xiao?

188
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,120
Stop teasing me.

189
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,510
Aren't you Xiao Qiushui,
the Third Young Master

190
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:19,440
of Huanhua Sect?

191
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,890
Xiao Qiushui of Huanhua Sect?

192
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,900
Xiao Qiushui of Huanhua Sect?

193
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:39,440
Yeas.

194
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,690
Wait, am I not dreaming?

195
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,750
I've... I've...
transmigrated into a novel?

196
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,370
Wait...

197
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,910
Is this the Daxi era now?

198
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:52,690
Yes, it is.

199
00:12:02,550 --> 00:12:05,440
Upstream along the Huanhua Creek
in the western suburbs of Jindu,

200
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,240
there is a Huanhua Sect.

201
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,750
The patriarch of the family, Xiao Xilou,
is highly respected in Jinzhong.

202
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,920
The Xiao family is prestigious locally.

203
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Xiao Xilou has 3 sons and a daughter.

204
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:18,080
The youngest son is

205
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,390
the recently famous Xiao Qiushui
in the martial world.

206
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,600
[Could it be that I've ended up inside]

207
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,430
[the martial arts novel]

208
00:12:25,430 --> 00:12:26,840
[Marvelous Heroes of Shenzhou that I rewrote?]

209
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,550
Now I've become Xiao Qiushui,

210
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,850
not Xiao Mingming anymore?

211
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:34,910
Let's go over there and take a look.

212
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,370
It's really lively today.

213
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,790
The private room
has been prepared for you.

214
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,750
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

215
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,090
In my version of the story,

216
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,840
the 20-year-old Xiao Qiushui

217
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,870
has already mastered
unparalleled martial arts skills

218
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:51,440
and has the Boiling Blood Cocoon
that can enhance his power at any time.

219
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,510
He is a top expert in the martial world,

220
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:56,150
the best in lightness skills,
internal energy, and sword skill.

221
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,030
[Looks like my luck]

222
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,360
[is not that bad at all.]

223
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,600
Not only did I transmigrate into
the main character,

224
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,800
but I also arrived at
the most glorious moment of his life.

225
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,830
Even if it's not real,

226
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,360
it's nice to dream in this novel.

227
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,120
Get out of the way!

228
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:14,570
Move aside!

229
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,240
Stop looking!

230
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,440
The thugs from the illegal gambling den
are here to kill you!

231
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,440
What should we do?

232
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,200
Get out of the way!

233
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,260
Hurry! Move aside!

234
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,890
No need to panic.

235
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,200
I have a plan.

236
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:30,720
Excuse me.

237
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:35,720
Let me show you

238
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,320
the supreme lightness skill I created.

239
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:39,710
Swift as a flying bird

240
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,400
and moving like a gentle breeze!

241
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,170
Something doesn't feel right.

242
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,260
Where's my supreme lightness skill?

243
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,550
Xiao Qiushui, stop right there!

244
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,770
Be careful!

245
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,180
Young Master Xiao?

246
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,460
His sister is here too?

247
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,960
My sister?

248
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:30,880
[Xiao Xueyu, Huanhua Sect]

249
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,600
Qiushui, you got into trouble again, huh?

250
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,840
Come home with me.

251
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:42,200
Let's see how Father punishes you
this time.

252
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:42,730
Let's go.

253
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,590
[Huanhua Sect]

254
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,880
[Xiao Xilou, Leader of Huanhua Sect]

255
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:11,080
[Xiao Kaiyan, Huanhua Sect]
[Xiao Xing, Huanhua Sect]

256
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,840
So you've finally come back.

257
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:29,150
How many times has this been?

258
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,720
Raise your head!

259
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,240
Look at me!

260
00:15:39,030 --> 00:15:40,030
Tell me honestly,

261
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,230
and you might avoid a beating today.

262
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,560
So you've learned
to hang around brothels now?

263
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,550
Do you even remember who you are?

264
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,960
Still drunk, huh?

265
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,550
Chasing courtesans

266
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:02,790
and staying out all night.

267
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,200
This time, Father is going to punish you,

268
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,460
and don't expect anyone to plead for you.

269
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,600
Father?

270
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:12,670
This is...

271
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,320
my father?

272
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,440
[In the original story,
Xiao Xilou seemed to]

273
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:27,960
[dislike Xiao Qiushui the most.]

274
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,560
[He thinks he's too unruly.]

275
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,600
[A wise man knows when to back down.]

276
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,650
Kneel properly!

277
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,240
Unfilial son.

278
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,240
Unfilial son.

279
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,910
Qiushui.

280
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,390
Qiushui.

281
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,450
Father, Father.

282
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,450
I was wrong.

283
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,480
It's weird.

284
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:05,000
You're usually so stubborn.

285
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,790
Why did you admit
you were wrong so quickly today?

286
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:12,069
Father, Qiushui is just young and playful.

287
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,680
But he's been investigating

288
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:15,960
the Beihuang Army spies in Jinzhong,

289
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,640
just as you instructed.

290
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,200
I see.

291
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:29,090
If that's the case,

292
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:29,880
then…

293
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,240
Father, we should ask Qiushui

294
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,200
what he has found out.

295
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:43,980
Well then, tell us.

296
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,010
Qiushui,

297
00:17:46,790 --> 00:17:48,420
these past few days, Kaiyan and I

298
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,880
have been running around.

299
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,980
I didn't expect you

300
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,010
to be so lazy and unmotivated.

301
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,570
[You're the only one
with a mouth here, huh?]

302
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,900
Let's think this through.

303
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,430
Father,

304
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:04,110
Qiushui's mistake
is quite serious this time.

305
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,680
He should be punished properly.

306
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,340
[You're twisting the knife?]

307
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:10,110
[My second brother
is actually making it worse?]

308
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:11,370
This is backstabbing.

309
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,390
Aren't you two my real brothers?

310
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:17,310
Is it necessary to pour fuel on the fire?

311
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,550
Since Father asked me to teach you
martial arts on his behalf,

312
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,270
I have the right to discipline you.

313
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,680
Father, a tree won't grow straight
without pruning,

314
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,240
and a person won't succeed
without teaching.

315
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:25,640
Right.

316
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,880
Alright.
Let's resort to the punishing rod.

317
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,980
Xilou.

318
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,330
A child's misbehavior
is also the mother's fault.

319
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:43,970
Why don't you let me, his mother,

320
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:44,670
[Sun Huishan, Huanhua Sect]

321
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,500
give this mischievous brat a lesson?

322
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:50,070
Mingming, here, the noodles are ready.

323
00:18:52,110 --> 00:18:52,790
Mom?

324
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,200
Yiren!

325
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,250
Bring the cane.

326
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,640
Mother, maybe we should let Yiren...

327
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,110
Yes.

328
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:02,410
Step aside!

329
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,480
[Mom,]

330
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,350
[how did you come back to life here too?]

331
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:12,550
But why isn't my dad my real dad anymore?

332
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,310
Why are you laughing?

333
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,550
You little brat.

334
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,560
You cause trouble everywhere.

335
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:22,750
I'm going to teach you a lesson today!

336
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,700
Let's see if you dare make trouble again.

337
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,510
[Mom, you're really hitting me?]

338
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,510
You're not wearing that underwear?

339
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,680
One whip, and you run.

340
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Stop right there!

341
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:41,550
Mom!

342
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,270
-Where are you going, you brat?
-Be gentle.

343
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,640
-Stop right there!
-Don't hit me for real!

344
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,720
Let's see where you can run to!

345
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,350
Stop!

346
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,480
-Stop!
-It hurts!

347
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,680
I'll beat you to death today!

348
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,140
She's really hitting him?

349
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,650
Have a cup of tea.

350
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:12,110
Mother, so this is what you meant?

351
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,680
Of course.

352
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,280
You always your father angry.

353
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:18,440
I especially made
these leather shorts for you.

354
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,100
This isn't ordinary leather.

355
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,870
It's from a Diamond Python.

356
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Normal swords can't even pierce it.

357
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:27,030
Mother.

358
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:30,060
I thought...

359
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,070
I would never see you again.

360
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:35,760
You silly child.

361
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,870
What are you doing?
Are you cursing your mother?

362
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,730
Mother, it's so good to see you.

363
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,940
You actually have tears in your eyes.

364
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:55,920
Mom, where does

365
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,000
my martial skill stand now?

366
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,070
What?

367
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,400
I mean level.

368
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:12,110
Isn't there always some ranking
in the martial world?

369
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,930
I know I'm definitely not first,

370
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:17,790
but I should
at least be on the list, right?

371
00:21:30,070 --> 00:21:31,400
Are you running a fever?

372
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:32,430
No.

373
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,320
Your rank in the martial world?

374
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:36,820
Let me tell you—

375
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,570
here in this household,

376
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,720
you're ranked fifth.

377
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:41,290
Your father, your mother,

378
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,480
your big brother, your second brother,

379
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,280
and then you.

380
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,080
But I...

381
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,640
aren't I supposed to have
extraordinary talent

382
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,070
and remarkable potential?

383
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:55,310
Yes, you do have good fundamentals.

384
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,200
But you were such a wild child
while growing up.

385
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,130
Your father and I didn't force you.

386
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:02,000
You didn't properly practice
the Xiao's Sword Technique

387
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,600
and created
your own Qiushui Sword Technique.

388
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,880
You didn't lose a fight with someone

389
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,940
this time, did you?

390
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,160
No.

391
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,240
Mom, how's my lightness skill?

392
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,920
It's always been your weak spot.

393
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,920
What about my internal energy?

394
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,150
It's average.

395
00:22:27,270 --> 00:22:29,790
Why are you being so weird?

396
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:30,590
Did you lose your memory?

397
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,990
Why are you asking
so many questions today?

398
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,310
This isn't quite what I imagined.

399
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:41,200
Mother, how big is the gap between me
and that Li Chenzhou

400
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,330
from the Power Gang?

401
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:54,110
Qiushui, you can joke about other things,

402
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,810
but on this matter,

403
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:58,370
you must remember what your father said:

404
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,810
never provoke anyone from the Power Gang.

405
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:05,000
The Power Gang rules the martial world

406
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
and kills as will.

407
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:07,920
Countless heroes

408
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,960
have mysteriously died under their blades.

409
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,920
Every one
of the 19 Demons of Heaven and Earth

410
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,920
is a top-tier master

411
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,000
in the martial world.

412
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,940
And their chief you mentioned,
Li Chenzhou,

413
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,790
is even more unfathomable.

414
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:27,160
Stop spending every day
dreaming unrealistic dreams

415
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,170
of becoming famous overnight.

416
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,080
Without martial arts skill,

417
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,750
how dare I challenge the Power Gang?

418
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,970
Wait, that Crazy Yan...

419
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:40,830
Didn't Crazy Yan

420
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,510
unblock my Ren and Du meridians?

421
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:44,300
When Crazy Yan disappeared,

422
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,830
you were just a little kid.

423
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,330
And he hasn't shown up
in the martial world for years.

424
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:51,480
If he really shows up,

425
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:54,790
there'd probably be blood and chaos
all over again.

426
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,550
Mom, let me do it.

427
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,310
Mom, do we have

428
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:08,530
any super powerful martial arts manual?

429
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,790
You know, the kind that

430
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,160
can make you improve rapidly
once you practice it.

431
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,680
Don't you dare say that
in front of your father.

432
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,510
You haven't even mastered
Huanhua Sword Technique yet,

433
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:17,640
and you're already thinking about
learning other skills.

434
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,170
Alright.

435
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,550
Mom, let me ask you one last question.

436
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:22,960
Why do you have so many questions today?
Mother, one last question.

437
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,240
Is Xueyu really my sister?

438
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,720
Xueyu is our Xiao family's
adopted daughter.

439
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,270
She's had a tough life.

440
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,590
You should take good care of your sister,
understand?

441
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:35,900
Okay.

442
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:38,070
Now stop overthinking.

443
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,560
I'm going to see your father.

444
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,240
Remember,

445
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,970
don't make him angry, okay?

446
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:43,830
Alright, Mom.

447
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,170
Eat the orange.

448
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:46,680
Okay.

449
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,110
Xiao Qiushui's character setting
is from the original novel,

450
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:02,770
but somehow the changes I made to Xueyu
got kept.

451
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,440
Could this be…

452
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:07,650
interactive storytelling
powered by the Magic Codex?

453
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,000
Maybe if I raise my combat level,

454
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:12,110
I'll return to the story I wrote.

455
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:13,890
Whatever.

456
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,900
Let me gather some gear first.

457
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:23,340
[Xiao's Sword Tomb]

458
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,680
So many swords.

459
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:38,160
I read it in a hurry back then.

460
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,720
I only skimmed the novel.

461
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,000
I barely remember anything.

462
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,750
But I do remember

463
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,610
the protagonist's golden cheat.

464
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:47,960
I remember
the legendary martial arts manual,

465
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,000
The Voidheart Codex,

466
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:52,510
was hidden right here
in the Xiao's Sword Tomb.

467
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,370
I'd better look for it carefully.

468
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,400
But where is it?

469
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,110
I can't see it. I can't see it.

470
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,040
Such an extraordinary martial arts manual

471
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,600
must be hidden in a very mysterious place.

472
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,440
In lots of martial arts novels,

473
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,640
top-tier manuals

474
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,770
are hidden in stone coffins like this.

475
00:27:49,270 --> 00:27:49,930
Never mind.

476
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,750
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

477
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,770
Why are there only swords?

478
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,530
No Voidheart Codex?

479
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,200
Welcome to the
Magic Codex Interactive Writing System.

480
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,120
Hello, User.

481
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:40,480
You deviated
from the original character settings

482
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,590
while using the Magic Codex.

483
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,240
Please restart
The New Marvelous Heroes of Shenzhou.

484
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,020
You're the Magic Codex, huh?

485
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,400
Come on, show yourself.

486
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:53,210
Stop being so mysterious.

487
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:55,110
Fine.

488
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,300
How about this?

489
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,880
Let's talk about it.

490
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,460
Let me ask you something.

491
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:02,660
Why can't I take some creative liberty?

492
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,270
The Marvelous Heroes of Shenzhou

493
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,400
is a classic 1980s martial arts novel.

494
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:08,920
It's not like the overpowered
wish-fulfillment stories

495
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,110
popular these days.

496
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:12,680
It follows
the traditional martial arts novel setting

497
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,390
where the male protagonist starts
as an ordinary person,

498
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:15,590
needing to endure hardship

499
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,510
and train his body and mind

500
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:19,370
before ultimately becoming
a martial arts master.

501
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,550
The Magic Codex
will preserve the essence of the original

502
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:25,880
and make reasonable adaptations
based on this foundation.

503
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,480
To hell with your adaptations.

504
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,720
Classic martial arts novels
also need a fresh take.

505
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,830
What fun is a story if the protagonist
doesn't have any golden cheats?

506
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:32,790
Besides,

507
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,400
real life is frustrating enough.

508
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,950
Do I really have to suffer in a novel too?

509
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:42,130
Cat got your tongue?

510
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,550
I'm asking you a question.

511
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,830
Not going to answer, huh?

512
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,310
Fine. I'm out.

513
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,680
I'm going back to work.

514
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:51,790
You can't leave. You can't quit

515
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:54,110
until the main mission is complete.

516
00:29:56,750 --> 00:29:58,550
Playing this trick with me, huh?

517
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:01,830
Start your story
with Xiao Qiushui going to Zihui

518
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:04,550
and end it with him becoming

519
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,130
the Martial Arts Alliance Leader.

520
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:10,510
Wait.

521
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,840
Let me ask you something.

522
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,260
In this chaotic world,

523
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,000
there's the Power Gang,

524
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,090
Zhu the Great King,

525
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,640
and the Northern Wastelander.

526
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,440
If you don't let me have a golden cheat,

527
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,550
how could I survive until next year's
Martial Arts Tournament?

528
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:24,610
Are you kidding me?

529
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:27,350
If you can become the sect leader
of Huanhua Sect,

530
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:30,000
you'll enter your own plot outline,

531
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,740
and the Magic Codex
won't interfere with your creation.

532
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,890
Before that,

533
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,650
pay attention
to the following creative taboos:

534
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,410
You are forbidden
from spoiling key plot points.

535
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:44,800
The pouch will constantly
remind you of your progress.

536
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,030
What if I just refuse?

537
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:53,240
Remember the buff you gave yourself,

538
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,700
the Boiling Blood Cocoon?

539
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,310
It's been changed into

540
00:30:56,330 --> 00:30:58,650
a gu poison lying dormant in your hand.

541
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,960
If you break a taboo,

542
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,510
the Boiling Blood Cocoon will activate.

543
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,310
The first time will be a warning,

544
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,480
and the second time will kill you.

545
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,790
How nasty.

546
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,480
Remember,

547
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,550
this is

548
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,350
a simple growth-oriented story
of the male protagonist's hardships.

549
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:18,350
Uphold justice with your martial arts,
gather allies with chivalry,

550
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,550
and write your own chronicle

551
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:22,480
of a hero in the martial world.

552
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:26,750
What's wrong with you?
I won't accept this!

553
00:31:50,130 --> 00:31:51,290
What the hell?

554
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:56,830
I'm sorry.

555
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:03,960
In a martial world
where the strong devour the weak,

556
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,070
being a swordsman

557
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:06,330
without a golden cheat

558
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:08,200
is a high-risk profession.

559
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:09,960
With my martial arts skills,

560
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,030
not to mention surviving until next year's
Martial Arts Tournament,

561
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,690
just living until the siege
of the Xiao family would be a blessing.

562
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,110
Looks like

563
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,340
I only have one option now:

564
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:23,910
lay low.

565
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,880
I'll keep a low profile

566
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:29,580
and just survive until the end.

567
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,590
Challenge the Gold and Silver Bank?

568
00:32:54,790 --> 00:32:57,880
The Gold and Silver Bank in Zihui
is the territory of the Power Gang.

569
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,480
In the original novel,
Xiao Qiushui triggered

570
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:03,030
the massacre of his entire family
because of this.

571
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,920
No way I'll challenge
the Gold and Silver Bank.

572
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,850
I'm not going to get myself killed.

573
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,170
I'll just hide up in the mountains.

574
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:12,470
As long as I stay far away
from those tough plot points,

575
00:33:12,470 --> 00:33:13,680
no villains

576
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
will ever find me.

577
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,720
[Xiao Residence]

578
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:37,030
[Huanhua Sect]

579
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:05,150
I'm still here?

580
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,080
What's going on?

581
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:17,800
This stupid system.

582
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:19,770
I can't get rid of this.

583
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:35,670
This look?

584
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,190
This braid?

585
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,280
No way.

586
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:51,590
It's been reset?

587
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:46,360
Young Master, you are here.

588
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:47,190
Good day, Young Master.

589
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,990
-Good day, Young Master.
-Morning, Young Master.

590
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,070
So this is what the martial world
looks like?

591
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:22,360
Big Brother.

592
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,360
Tang Xu, Deng Zhe, and Li Chaofan?

593
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,280
Those three also transmigrated?

594
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:37,960
Come here.

595
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:39,800
Big Brother!

596
00:37:42,490 --> 00:37:45,110
Big Brother,

597
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,920
you said we're... "university roommates"

598
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,330
and all in the Qin Club.

599
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,280
Are people in the Qin Club
skilled in martial arts?

600
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,710
Qiushui, are you still drunk?

601
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,920
Big Brother, we're just going to watch
a dragon boat race.

602
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,110
You don't have to be so excited.

603
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:03,440
Are you messing with me?

604
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,730
Can two people look so similar?

605
00:38:08,710 --> 00:38:11,000
Xiao Qiushui may not be
a top-tier martial artist,

606
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,460
but he has a lot of friends.

607
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,230
These three must be

608
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,330
the three best friends
of the male protagonist

609
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,590
in the original novel.

610
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,590
How can they look exactly

611
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,280
like my real-life friends?

612
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:23,440
What kind of bug is this?

613
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,680
[Zuoqiu Chaoran,
Bone-Dismantling Immortal]

614
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:31,380
[Good at Joint Lock]

615
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,970
[Tang Rou, heir of Tang Sect,
good at hidden weapons]

616
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:34,440
[Deng Yuhan, son of the sect leader
of Hailin Sword Sect]

617
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,570
I can't keep a low profile,

618
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,030
and I can't run away.

619
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:42,110
Since I must follow the original plot,

620
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,960
it looks like the only way to survive

621
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,820
is to hide behind these brothers.

622
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,150
Honestly, I don't know what should I say
about Big Brother.

623
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:51,190
He passed out drunk at the door at night

624
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:53,000
and couldn't even find his own room.

625
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,670
You two shouldn't let him
drink anymore in the future.

626
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,230
I...

627
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,000
We wouldn't dare.

628
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:57,710
I didn't.

629
00:38:58,590 --> 00:39:00,450
Alright, alright, stop talking.

630
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,840
I'll have some water. I am a bit thirsty.

631
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,070
Zuoqiu,

632
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:25,710
how's your Joint Lock coming along?

633
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:32,450
Big Brother, why are you looking at him
when talking to me?

634
00:39:28,590 --> 00:39:30,650
[Zuoqiu Chaoran,
Bone-Dismantling Immortal]

635
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:42,880
Tang Rou.

636
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,710
Cheers.

637
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,970
[Tang Rou, heir of Tang Sect]

638
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,060
[Deng Yuhan, son of the sect leader
of Hailin Sect]

639
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,320
Big Brother,

640
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,600
I heard you got scolded by Mr. Xiao again.

641
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,050
Does that mean we have to postpone
our trip to Zihui?

642
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,280
I came here this time

643
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:18,850
to discuss this matter with you.

644
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,180
This Dragon Boat Festival trip to Zihui,

645
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,740
we're not going to watch
the dragon boat race.

646
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:25,470
There,

647
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:28,970
we'll to meet a gang that bullies people.

648
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:31,250
It's called the Gold and Silver Bank.

649
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,110
I knew there had to be another reason

650
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:35,370
Big Brother called us.

651
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,070
There's another fight coming up.

652
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,480
All you know is fighting.

653
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,480
Over the years,
the four of us have specialized in

654
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,920
taking down these unscrupulous rich gangs.

655
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,650
Big Brother,

656
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,800
just tell us—

657
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,260
what's the plan this time?

658
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,920
We're not going to fight this time.

659
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,010
We're going to ambush them.

660
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:55,880
Ambush them?

661
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,030
Big Brother,
you're acting a bit off today.

662
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:02,480
Big Brother always has a plan.

663
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,320
Let's hear him out first.

664
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,840
Do you know

665
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,770
who's behind the Gold and Silver Bank?

666
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:21,590
Who is it?

667
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:24,840
Fu Tianyi, a demon from the Power Gang.
