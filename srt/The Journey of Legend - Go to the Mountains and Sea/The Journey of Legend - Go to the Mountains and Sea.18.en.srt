[The Journey of Legend]

00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:43,920
[Episode 18]

3
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:45,930
Qiushui!

4
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:53,680
Qiushui!

5
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,430
Xiao Qiushui!

6
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:13,910
Aren't you afraid of death?

7
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,079
The Power Gang destroyed our Xiao family.

8
00:02:18,170 --> 00:02:20,100
So what does death matter to me now?

9
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,160
Xiao Qiushui.

10
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,130
I know you're desperate for revenge,

11
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,820
but in your current condition,

12
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,470
you're no match for them.

13
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,120
Even if it costs me my life,

14
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,340
I won't let them get away with it.

15
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,000
If we lend you our power,

16
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,590
you might stand a chance against them.

17
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,540
Unfortunately, we've been infected with
worm poison.

18
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,950
If we transfer our power to you,

19
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,260
I'm afraid it would harm you.

20
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,140
Indeed,

21
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,540
and you'd be infected with
worm poison too.

22
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,070
Seniors.

23
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,420
I'm already a worthless person.

24
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,230
Even if I'm poisoned,

25
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,790
what difference does it make to me?

26
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,140
But Qiushui,

27
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,880
once our power's unleashed upon you,

28
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,980
the agony will be as if your bones
are crushed and your tendons torn.

29
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,710
As long as I can have my revenge,

30
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,190
I fear not death!

31
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,690
I beg you, Seniors,

32
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,310
please impart your internal energy to me!

33
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,579

00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,880
Borrowing someone else's internal energy.

54
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,960
Interesting.

55
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,920
Father's jade pendant?

56
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,310
Father once said that while
the jade pendant exists, the person lives;

57
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:45,770
if the pendant is lost,
the person perishes.

58
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,990
Could Father and Mother have...

59
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,190
Liu Suifeng.

60
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:01,270
Where are my parents?

61
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,350
Where are my parents!

62
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,090
Liu Suifeng.

63
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:20,360
Today is your day to die!

64
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,840
This kid has incredible resilience.

65
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,550
Our utterly different types of
internal energy

66
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,080
actually flowed through his meridians

67
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,450
with barely a hitch.

68
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,530
If he survives today,

69
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,850
his potential will be limitless.

70
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:36,510
Indeed.

71
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:46,550
Tianzheng.

72
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:50,080
This kid doesn't seem to be affected
by the worm poison.

73
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,890
Xiao Qiushui originally had
no internal energy.

74
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:57,780
Where would the poison worms
attach themselves?

75
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:22,970
Liu Suifeng endangers the martial world
and causes endless trouble.

76
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,900
We absolutely cannot let him live.

77
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,110
Master!

78
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,340
Master! Master!

79
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,630
Longhu.

80
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,260
Why did you...

81
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,670
Master.

82
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:14,780
I can never repay

83
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,880
your years of guidance.

84
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,510
But the Power Gang saved my life,

85
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,140
and I must repay that debt.

86
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,460
Longhu!

87
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:25,220
I'll kill you!

88
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:25,950
Baoxiang.

89
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:27,550
Forget it.

90
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:28,900
Master.

91
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,550
He was your senior for many years
after all.

92
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,059
It's not your place to punish him.

93
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,429
Master...

94
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:38,390
Longhu.

95
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,789
After today, do you consider
that life-saving debt repaid?

96
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:46,460
Yes.

97
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,740
That's good then.

98
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,820
Life and death aside,

99
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,720
with all debts and grudges resolved,

100
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:58,340
your inner demon can finally
be laid to rest.

101
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:15,580
Today,

102
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:18,670
I've repaid all my debts.

103
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,150
And now,

104
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:22,580
I'll repay what I owe you, Master!

105
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,720
Such a tragic fate.

106
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,860
Amitabha.

107
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,690
-Master!
-Master!

108
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:03,700
Senior!

109
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:23,910
Master!

110
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,540
[Calm and Composed]

111
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,390
S-Senior.

112
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,550
How could this be?

113
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:19,100
Who would have thought that
even Leader Mo of Hengshan Sect

114
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:22,790
is also a member of the Power Gang?

115
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,430
How has Daxi's martial world

116
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,100
come to this?

117
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,600
Tianzheng.

118
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,150
All our lives, we've rivaled each other
in secret over martial arts.

119
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,120
Who would have thought

120
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,670
we'd leave this world together?

121
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,030
Ascending to immortality.

122
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,310
Reaching the Western paradise.

123
00:11:57,140 --> 00:12:03,570
Each following the Zen path
to our own destiny.

124
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,480
Master. Master!

125
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:06,980
Following the Zen path...

126
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:07,910
Senior...

127
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,700
To our own destiny.

128
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:24,060
Amitabha.

129
00:12:40,340 --> 00:12:41,150
Master!

130
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,950
Amitabha.

131
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,620
Namo Amitabha. Namo Amitabha.

132
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,910
Namo Amitabha. Namo Amitabha.

133
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,310
What's exactly going on?

134
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,840
It was Liu Suifeng of the Power Gang

135
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,880
who schemed to kill
Masters Tianzheng and Taichan.

136
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,410
Qiushui.

137
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,210
Qiushui.

138
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,280
Where are our parents?

139
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,310
Tell me! What exactly happened?

140
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,570
Where are our parents!

141
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,670
Yiren.

142
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,980
Feng Lang is Liu Suifeng.

143
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,340
It's all my fault.

144
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,910
I trusted him wrongly.

145
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:17,000
I'm the one who harmed our parents

146
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:19,790
and the Huanhua Sect!

147
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,580
What?

148
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,550
Isn't Feng Lang your friend?

149
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,150
How could he be Liu Suifeng?

150
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,820
I was blind.

151
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,270
I was blind
and foolishly took a villain for a friend.

152
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,470
I foolishly took a villain for a friend!

153
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,460
What? What did you say!

154
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:04,870
Enough!

155
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:08,060
This is not what Qiushui wanted either.

156
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:08,880
Get out of my way!

157
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,510
Yiren!

158
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,240
The affairs of the Xiao family

159
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,500
are none of your business as an outsider!

160
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:17,680
Big Brother!

161
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:19,950
Big Brother!

162
00:15:21,390 --> 00:15:22,120
Big Brother!

163
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,310
Big Brother!

164
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:24,070
Qiushui.

165
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:26,370
Why did you do that?

166
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,120
Kaiyan.

167
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:33,390
Ask him!

168
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,390
Ask him why he invited the wolf
into our house

169
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,820
and gave that villain Liu Suifeng a chance
to strike!

170
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,150
He even befriended him,

171
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,120
caused our parents' deaths,

172
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:46,120
and brought our Xiao family to this state!

173
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,030
What?

174
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,470
Our parents' deaths...

175
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,300
Our parents are dead?

176
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:04,220
Qiushui.

177
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:06,670
What exactly happened?

178
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,740
Kaiyan.

179
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,740
It's all my fault.

180
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,670
It's all my fault.

181
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,700
Tell me about it.

182
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,170
Tell everyone!

183
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:20,790

00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,310

The last time
the three of us brothers gathered

421
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,260
was several months ago.

422
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,660
-Yes.
-We shall not part until drunk today.

423
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,100
You should thank Kaiyan.

424
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,720
He specially prepared this

425
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,700
so we brothers could have
a proper gathering today.

426
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,390
Let's drink to our heart's content.

427
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,430
Qiushui, why aren't you drinking?

428
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,430
I'm about to.

429
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,630
Aren't you always out

430
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:46,780
drinking and womanizing?

431
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,890
How come you're not
drinking with us today?

432
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:51,220
How do you usually drink
at Qunfang House?

433
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,400
Well, my b... My butt...

434
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,190
Your butt.

435
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,720
You think I didn't hear?

436
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:58,200
Mother prepared leather underwear for you.

437
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,760
Well... I didn't wear them anyway.

438
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,780
Come on, have a drink and you'll be fine.

439
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,980
Alcohol disinfects.

440
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,640
Bottoms up!

441
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:07,980
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

442
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:10,950
Xiao Yiren, the dignified

443
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,000
and ambitious eldest son
of the Xiao family.

444
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,150
Xiao Kaiyan, steady and silent,

445
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,220
the solid pillar of Huanhua Sect.

446
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:18,870
Drink up.

447
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,540
Yiren, Qiushui, try this.

448
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:29,360
I hunted this wild boar in Guangling.

449
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:32,150
These boars roam all over the mountains,

450
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,210
and their meat is excellent. Come on.

451
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:35,630
Here.

452
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,720
Qiushui, try this.

453
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,980
This was specially caught
from the open sea by Kaiyan.

454
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,350
Thank you, Yiren, Kaiyan.

455
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:45,700
Here.

456
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,060
Here.

457
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,780
By the way, Yiren, Kaiyan.

458
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,700
I spoke recklessly before

459
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,540
and offended you both more than once.

460
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:57,830
Let me offer you this cup of wine
as an apology.

461
00:31:59,630 --> 00:32:03,060
Yiren, Qiushui's acting
so differently today.

462
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,460
It feels quite strange.

463
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,630
Well, he's willing to take the punishment.

464
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,390
Come on, cheers. Bottoms up.

465
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,590
That's the spirit! Come on.

466
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,220
Cheers!

467
00:32:18,430 --> 00:32:18,960
Alright!

468
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:22,010
Come on! Cheers!

469
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,760
Come on, bottoms up!

470
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,910
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

471
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,220
Qiushui, why are you cheating again?

472
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,080
Yiren, Kaiyan.

473
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:29,740
Yiren...

474
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:36,150
Kaiyan...

475
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:09,910
Qiushui.

476
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:33,210
Xueyu.

477
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:45,440
All the way here,
I've been praying to heaven

478
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,240
to protect our Xiao family.

479
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,220
But I still came too late.

480
00:36:03,970 --> 00:36:05,660
I've failed our parents.

481
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:07,910
Xueyu.

482
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:10,980
Don't say that.

483
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,550
It's all my fault.

484
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:26,310
Qiushui.

485
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:31,420
Since your martial arts
were crippled earlier,

486
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:33,180
I imagine

487
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,140
the meridians in your body

488
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,940
must now be in complete chaos.

489
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,180
You should be extra careful.

490
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:45,290
I will.

491
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,870
The bodies of

492
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,890
Masters Tianzheng and Taichan...

493
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:58,030
The bodies of the two masters

494
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:00,090
were taken back to the Central Plains

495
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,750
by their disciples yesterday.

496
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:02,950
What about Uncle Qu?

497
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:05,910
The Qu sisters were too grief-stricken.

498
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,660
They're now resting at the inn

499
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,860
with Uncle Qu's body.

500
00:37:17,590 --> 00:37:20,050
They all died trying to help
our Xiao family.

501
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,530
I should have been the one
to send them off.

502
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:25,620
Big Brother.

503
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,080
Don't worry.

504
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,660
Leave the Qu family's matters to me.

505
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,910
Qiu.

506
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,450
Then I'll trouble you to make the trip.

507
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,750
Big Brother.

508
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:46,580
After Yiren left,

509
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,390
he arranged for the mortuary downhill
to come and collect the bodies.

510
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:51,350
But the mortuary

511
00:37:51,750 --> 00:37:53,680
fears the Power Gang might return,

512
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:57,460
so they won't come up to collect
the bodies until two days later.

513
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,990
The weather is so hot.

514
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,750
We absolutely cannot delay
for another two days.

515
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,950
They died fighting for the Xiao family.

516
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:08,810
If I can't see to their proper burial,

517
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:12,870
how could I possibly sleep at night?

518
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:16,830
Qiushui.

519
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,880
We'll be with you.

Father, Mother.

521
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,060
I don't know

522
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:29,710
if I still deserve to call you that now.

[In Memory of Late Father, Xiao Xilou]

525
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:34,040
Because

526
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,460
I'm not really Xiao Qiushui.

527
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,390
Your son Xiao Qiushui

528
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:49,540
was a true hero in the martial world.

529
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:53,580
I've fantasized countless times

530
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,940
about becoming the protagonist
in martial arts novels.

531
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:01,970
But when the time really came,

532
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,950
I realized that I'm not worthy at all.

533
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:10,180
Mother,

534
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,460
you know what?

535
00:40:13,230 --> 00:40:15,540
When I suddenly entered this world,

536
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:21,700
I thought I could save the entire world.

537
00:40:27,910 --> 00:40:29,790
I thought I was so clever.

538
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,380
With my foreknowledge of

539
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,460
all those plots from the novel,

540
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,830
I thought I could change everyone's fate.

541
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,790
But in the end,

542
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:46,620
I realized I couldn't change anything.

543
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,500
It was all my own arrogance.

544
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,230
I was truly too proud

545
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,870
and too conceited.

546
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,430
Now,

547
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:08,020
I've made everything turn out
even worse than it would have.

548
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:09,390

549
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,430
wouldn't have had
his martial skills crippled

550
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:15,230
and his tendons severed.

551
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,180
If he were here,

552
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:19,910
he might even have gotten revenge.

553
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,060
But now,

554
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,110
I've dragged Xiao Qiushui down with me

555
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,560
and lost completely and utterly.
