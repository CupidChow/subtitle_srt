1
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,840
You're going to end up
in a living hell

2
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,759
because of your secrets.

3
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm going to divorce you.

4
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,479
How come you're suddenly
willing to do so?

5
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:41,960
You should be starting your own life

6
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:43,240
and building your own future.

7
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,120
You shouldn't waste your time
trying to win.

8
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,560
So are you divorcing him or not?

9
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:48,199
There's nothing else
to lie to your dad about.

10
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,879
- What is it?
- It's Nai.

11
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,400
Are you and her...

12
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:52,520
In my heart,

13
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,199
there's only room for Pa.

14
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,039
You shouldn't go around saying
you have feelings for her.

15
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,400
You were seducing
someone else's boyfriend.

16
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:00,039
Stop!

17
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,000
You were seducing my boyfriend.

18
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,599
You can talk it out with her, Trai.

19
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Trai.

20
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,560
Why are you mad at me?

21
00:03:10,639 --> 00:03:12,560
Am I not allowed to get jealous?

22
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
I'm sorry

23
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:17,000
for letting things escalate.

24
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,240
What do you mean?

25
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,479
All this time,

26
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,919
I've known that you thought

27
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,120
I had a crush on you,

28
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,680
but I didn't say anything

29
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,759
because

30
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,560
I wanted to use you.

31
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,759
She can't slap people
just because she's rich.

32
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,039
Let it go, Mother.

33
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,719
I've already slapped her back.

34
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,840
It's fine now.

35
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,039
It's not fine.

36
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,800
I agree. How do you expect us
to be fine with this?

37
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,560
If I had known

38
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:59,080
that you would turn

39
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:01,520
into this kind of person,

40
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,159
I wouldn't have done it.

41
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,800
I'm sorry.

42
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,439
It's all right.

43
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,050
You don't need to apologize.

44
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,680
I'm used to being fooled by men.

45
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:39,199
But so far, you are the only one
who chose to be honest with me.

46
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,170
Please keep deceiving me.

47
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,439
I really don't mind.

48
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,360
Ms. Nade.

49
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,050
Have some respect for yourself.

50
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,680
But I love you.

51
00:05:03,319 --> 00:05:04,759
If I see her...

52
00:05:04,839 --> 00:05:05,959
Oh my dear.

53
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,759
Nade!

54
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:22,519
Both of you, meet me in my office!

55
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:24,050
Mom.

56
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:34,439
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

57
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,959
Let's go home.

58
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:52,720
Aren't you going to avenge Joy?

59
00:05:53,399 --> 00:05:55,920
Madame Nuan's going to take care
of that for me. Come on.

60
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,439
- Seriously?
- Come quick, Nit.

61
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,040
That's the guy

62
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,240
who opened the gate for us.

63
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,240
Did Ms. Nadedao kiss a servant?

64
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,600
I think so. Let me see.

65
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:30,040
Forward it to me.

66
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,279
- Okay.
- I'm dying to know.

67
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,120
All done.

68
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Where is it?

69
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,040
Oh no. I made a mistake.
What do I do?

70
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,759
I forwarded it to a group chat.

71
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:45,439
Really? Unsend now.

72
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,279
I have a message from Madame.

73
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,879
She only wants you to fix
the outfits she mentioned.

74
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,040
All right, we should get going then.

75
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,920
Sure.

76
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,639
By the way, after Madame receives
the Strong Woman Award,

77
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,279
she's going to Italy
for an important meeting.

78
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,839
She's going to need
many new dresses.

79
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,600
But since it's an important event,

80
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,480
Madame only wishes to work

81
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,959
with someone she can trust.

82
00:07:17,279 --> 00:07:20,800
I hope that person is you,
Ms. Srisuphang.

83
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Yes.

84
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,160
Did you manage to unsend it?

85
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,839
No.

86
00:07:43,839 --> 00:07:45,160
I knew it.

87
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,519
Hello, Pa.

88
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,199
Nai, come home now.

89
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:58,720
Why, Pa? Are you all right?

90
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,399
I'm fine.

91
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,040
But the ones in trouble...

92
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,759
No.

93
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,920
The ones who are about to be killed
are your sister and Trai.

94
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:18,839
I'm sorry I couldn't stop them.

95
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,040
Don't apologize.
You didn't do anything wrong.

96
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:29,560
Have you slept together?

97
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,120
I took a nap earlier today.

98
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,840
But I'm still sleepy,

99
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,450
so I'm planning
to take another nap.

100
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,360
I didn't take a nap.

101
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:41,039
I want to be tired tonight.

102
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,090
I meant, have you had sex?

103
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:54,639
I shouldn't even ask.

104
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,720
You kissed in front of everyone.

105
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,450
Imagine what you do in private.

106
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,519
We haven't.

107
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:05,480
Ms. Nade and I haven't had sex.

108
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,799
And we didn't mean to kiss

109
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:11,039
in front of everyone.

110
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:14,090
We were having a misunderstanding.

111
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,240
About what?

112
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,039
I knew she thought
I had a crush on her,

113
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,240
and I intentionally led her on.

114
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,519
All I wanted was some cash,

115
00:09:34,799 --> 00:09:36,240
not her body.

116
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,720
- Tom.
- Yes.

117
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,399
Call Inspector Aek.

118
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,960
And tell him

119
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,519
I have a prisoner for him
to lock up.

120
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,360
Mom.

121
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,399
And tell Erb and Phol

122
00:09:52,519 --> 00:09:54,600
to pack up their stuff
and leave my house.

123
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,120
They are fired.

124
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,639
Just punish me.

125
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,159
Uncle Phol and Auntie Erb
have nothing to do with this.

126
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,879
I have to punish them

127
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:05,879
for raising a bad nephew.

128
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,639
He can't tell right from wrong.

129
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:15,279
Then you must punish yourself

130
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,840
for raising
a stupid daughter like me.

131
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:26,159
It's true Trai was deceiving me,
but he never hurt me.

132
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,639
I was fooling myself,
and I seduced...

133
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,960
Ms. Nade.

134
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,799
You should know

135
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:37,679
that I hate it the most

136
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:40,450
when my children
side with other people.

137
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,960
I'm not siding with Trai.

138
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,399
It's the truth.

139
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,799
I don't want to cause Trai trouble.

140
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,879
He's a good man.

141
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,759
He's better than any man I've met.

142
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:03,399
Do you truly love Trai?

143
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,240
Nade.

144
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,240
Walk forward.

145
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,159
Cut yourself in the wrist.

146
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,519
Prove to me

147
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,559
that you love Trai enough

148
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,799
to overcome your fear of blood.

149
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,720
Don't do it, Ms. Nade.

150
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,039
Ms. Nade, don't do it.

151
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,440
Hold him, Tom.

152
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,960
Tom, let me go.

153
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:42,600
Go stop Ms. Nade. Don't let her
hurt herself because of me.

154
00:12:43,159 --> 00:12:44,440
- Be quiet.
- Tom.

155
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:45,639
Listen to me.

156
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,799
- Ms. Nade.
- Calm down.

157
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:48,799
Madame is only testing Ms. Nade.

158
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:51,919
Do it.

159
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:56,039
Do it now.

160
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,240
Go ahead.

161
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:05,399
Prove to me

162
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,039
that you love him.

163
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,960
Ms. Nade, don't do it.

164
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,159
Ms. Nade, don't do it!

165
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,960
Stop!

166
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:36,759
Ms. Nade.

167
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,759
Do you really love Trai?

168
00:13:57,879 --> 00:13:58,919
Thank you

169
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,799
for protecting me.

170
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,240
You should keep some distance,

171
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,720
- or Madame might...
- Tom.

172
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,879
They are in love.

173
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,440
Why get in between them?

174
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,799
You are not against us

175
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,279
being together anymore?

176
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,039
Why should I be?

177
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,120
My daughter has found
herself a good man.

178
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,440
I was just testing you.

179
00:14:29,679 --> 00:14:32,120
Now, I know

180
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,840
that you truly love him.

181
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:36,799
What about you, Trai?

182
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,759
How do you feel about Nade?

183
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,080
I feel nothing.

184
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:50,080
Nothing's going to be the same.

185
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,559
If you wish to date,

186
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,639
make sure to take things slow.

187
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,919
Be cautious of your actions.

188
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
Trai, leave us.

189
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,480
I want to speak with Nade.

190
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,159
Yes.

191
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,200
Hey.

192
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:40,799
Trai, what did Madame Nuan say?

193
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,799
She didn't say anything.

194
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,639
Thank you, Mom.

195
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:03,159
I love you.

196
00:16:08,559 --> 00:16:10,679
- Tom.
- Yes.

197
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:12,159
Leave us.

198
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,120
Yes.

199
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,000
Did you really think

200
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,320
that I would let you date Trai?

201
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,519
Mom...

202
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,440
If I got in between you and Trai,

203
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,559
Trai would tell everyone,

204
00:16:41,879 --> 00:16:43,840
including Pawinee.

205
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,600
Then Pawinee would say

206
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,919
that I meddled in my children's
relationships once again.

207
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,480
I refuse to have another flaw
for Pawinee to use against me.

208
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,240
You only care about winning.

209
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,639
That's because

210
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:05,119
this world is too cruel
for losers to survive in.

211
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,890
You have no idea

212
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,680
what I had to sacrifice

213
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,410
for you and Nai

214
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,680
to stand in this world as winners.

215
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:21,079
Therefore,

216
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,279
you cannot ruin my hard work

217
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,279
by falling in love
with the servant's nephew.

218
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,200
From now on,

219
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,960
it's your job

220
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,680
to get Trai out of your life.

221
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,240
If you don't do it,

222
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:45,799
don't expect

223
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,440
to see his face again.

224
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Nade.

225
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:05,650
How did it go?

226
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,839
Tell Nai

227
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,480
that you have found him
a brother-in-law.

228
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,960
Nade.

229
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,039
Nai.

230
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:55,559
Why did you follow me?

231
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,650
Are you here to mock me?

232
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,480
Why would I mock you?

233
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,319
Because I've always stood
in the way of your love.

234
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,079
But...

235
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:08,650
now I'm the one
with a forbidden love.

236
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:11,480
Then I should side with you

237
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:13,920
because we are a team now.

238
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,119
Mom won't let you
date Trai, will she?

239
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,920
No.

240
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,240
I'll talk to Mom for you.

241
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:36,680
No.

242
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:38,920
Don't do that.
Trai will get in trouble.

243
00:19:42,599 --> 00:19:44,890
- Hey, get up.
- What?

244
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,559
What do you want?

245
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,200
Answer me this.

246
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,039
Why do you love him?

247
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,599
I feel at ease
whenever I'm with him.

248
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
I don't have to wonder

249
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,960
whether I'm smart enough

250
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:07,960
or good enough for him.

251
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,890
Like the way I feel

252
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,680
with other men,

253
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,410
especially men Mom finds me.

254
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,599
I finally understand
what it feels like to find the one.

255
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:23,650
However...

256
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,119
Trai

257
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,200
is just not good enough for Mom.

258
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,960
Stay with me, will you?

259
00:20:41,519 --> 00:20:42,519
Sure.

260
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,960
What? Madame didn't say anything?

261
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,119
That's right.

262
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,839
She even told Ms. Nadedao
and Trai to follow their hearts.

263
00:20:59,319 --> 00:21:01,079
- Seriously?
- Yes.

264
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,240
She was so protective of Nai
when Da was around.

265
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,599
Maybe she's more protective
of her son.

266
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,410
That's strange.

267
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:15,650
People are usually more protective
of their daughters.

268
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,559
Or there wouldn't be a saying,

269
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,920
"Having a daughter is like having
a toilet in front of the house."

270
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,240
I've raised two girls.
I know what I'm talking about.

271
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,599
It's true.

272
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:29,319
We are a family of commoners,

273
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:31,920
but Uncle practically went nuts

274
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:33,650
when Da got knocked up.

275
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,720
Uncle.

276
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,359
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

277
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,720
It's fine.
I don't think about it anymore.

278
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,359
It's time for my medicine.

279
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,599
Gosh.

280
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,799
You are unbelievable.

281
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,680
Mother.

282
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:12,920
I wasn't thinking.

283
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,839
Plus, a lot of time has passed.

284
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,279
I thought he had forgotten about it.

285
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:22,240
It was a big deal. No parent could
easily forget about it.

286
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,480
Come, Mother.

287
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:01,759
Thank you for trying to avenge me.

288
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,559
No one is allowed to hurt
my daughter-in-law.

289
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:07,799
Hey.

290
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,839
Are you going to find someone new?

291
00:23:11,359 --> 00:23:17,480
Gosh, I told you that I wouldn't
date anyone unless his mother

292
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,519
was as kind as you.

293
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:23,079
You are being selfish right now.

294
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:25,880
Why are you insulting me?

295
00:23:26,079 --> 00:23:27,559
It's true.

296
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,160
I used to be a mother-in-law.

297
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,960
I know what it's like.

298
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:33,799
A girl needs to

299
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,480
approach her mother-in-law,

300
00:23:35,559 --> 00:23:37,759
not the other way around.

301
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:39,160
It's not easy

302
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,680
for a mother to raise a child.

303
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,839
It's so difficult
that one could cry blood.

304
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,039
Mothers sacrifice their own
happiness for their children.

305
00:23:50,119 --> 00:23:54,279
Therefore, we want our children
to meet good life partners.

306
00:23:54,839 --> 00:23:55,960
I understand.

307
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:59,119
What about a mother-in-law
like Madame Nuan?

308
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:05,640
Well, Madame Nuan must have made
great sacrifices for her family.

309
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,559
So she created this wall
that is incredibly hard to take down

310
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,519
to protect her children

311
00:24:12,599 --> 00:24:14,680
You might be right.

312
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:17,599
Yes.

313
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:25,359
Mr. Nai.

314
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,440
How is Ms. Nade doing?

315
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,480
She fell asleep.

316
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:33,640
Really? But she hasn't had dinner.

317
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,359
She's going to wake up hungry.

318
00:25:35,839 --> 00:25:38,559
Why don't we wake her up
to eat dinner first?

319
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,759
I'll ask Auntie Erb to cook
Ms. Nade's favorite food.

320
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:46,200
Do you happen to know

321
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,559
what she likes to eat?

322
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,680
You are annoying, you know that?

323
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
Well.

324
00:25:55,119 --> 00:25:57,400
I'm only following my heart.

325
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,160
Okay.

326
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,839
Pa.

327
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,000
Where are you going?

328
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:26,279
You look cute in that dress.
Don't you agree, Mr. Nai?

329
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,960
- Mr. Nai.
- Yes.

330
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,960
Where are you going?

331
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:43,839
Well.

332
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,599
I'm having dinner with Mr. Singkorn.

333
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,640
Why?

334
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,720
Is there no food here?

335
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,079
Or do you want something
in particular?

336
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,079
Tell me. I'll take you there.

337
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:59,240
You are annoying, you know that?

338
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:06,240
Here's the thing.

339
00:27:06,839 --> 00:27:09,000
I still owe Mr. Singkorn a favor.

340
00:27:09,079 --> 00:27:10,680
I want to thank him

341
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,480
for choosing Thom's company
to work on the Health Plus project.

342
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,759
I'm coming with you.

343
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,119
Why?

344
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,599
To keep an eye on him.

345
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:21,799
You know what a player he is.

346
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,240
Don't worry.

347
00:27:23,759 --> 00:27:25,559
Someone will be doing that for you.

348
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:26,920
Who?

349
00:27:28,119 --> 00:27:29,400
Me.

350
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,559
Today, I'm going to be
my beautiful daughter's bodyguard.

351
00:27:47,759 --> 00:27:49,400
I'm not doing it for you.

352
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:50,960
I'm doing it for Thom,

353
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,920
my future son-in-law.

354
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:59,960
Let's go, my beautiful daughter.

355
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:01,759
Make way please.

356
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:13,079
How could you let him call Thom
his future son-in-law?

357
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,079
I would do something about it.

358
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,119
Because I'm divorcing Pa.

359
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:24,960
Divorce?

360
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:32,200
- Dad.
- Yes.

361
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,039
Do you know why
I'm making you come with me?

362
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,119
I'm guessing you want to
take me out to try something new.

363
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,920
That's part of it.

364
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,720
But most importantly,

365
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:47,559
it would hurt your feelings
if people said

366
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,319
they saw me alone with Mr. Singkorn.

367
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,039
I see.

368
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:53,799
I love you.

369
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,599
I know.

370
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,920
Look at you.

371
00:28:57,599 --> 00:28:58,680
Are you embarrassed?

372
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:00,200
Your ride is here.

373
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:02,680
- Thank you, Jai.
- No problem.

374
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:03,759
Let's go, Dad.

375
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,440
Good luck.

376
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,960
If you divorce her,

377
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:13,720
many guys will surely hit on her.

378
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,200
Then it will be harder

379
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:17,559
for you to get her back.

380
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,599
If Pa meets the one,

381
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:21,799
I'll be happy for her.

382
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:25,519
Don't talk like
you don't like feelings for her.

383
00:29:26,359 --> 00:29:28,079
What makes you think I like her?

384
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,039
Nai.

385
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,799
I could sense your love from space.

386
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:35,839
I admit

387
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:39,200
that if I had to start over
with someone,

388
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,079
I'd want that person to be Pa.

389
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:46,279
But Pa doesn't like me.

390
00:29:46,839 --> 00:29:47,880
She might not like you now,

391
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,000
but her feelings might change.

392
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,720
You must use the time you have
until the divorce to go for her

393
00:29:53,799 --> 00:29:55,319
with everything you've got

394
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,200
and use your status
as her legal husband

395
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,799
to drive away other men.

396
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:03,279
Then do whatever it takes
to win her over.

397
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,240
What if I go for her,

398
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:08,640
but she turns me down?

399
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,319
Won't that make me lose her?

400
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,319
But if you don't do anything,

401
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,599
not only will you lose Pa,

402
00:30:15,839 --> 00:30:18,160
you will also be heartbroken,

403
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,599
regret your effort and time,

404
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,720
and go crazy when you see her
with another man.

405
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,279
Won't that be worse?

406
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,359
I'll think about it.

407
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,359
I'd like the pan-seared foie gras.

408
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,920
(Dao)

409
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,000
Please excuse me.

410
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,440
Dad, order food for me.

411
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:11,839
I need to answer Dao's call.

412
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:17,480
I'll be right back.

413
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,720
What would you like to order?

414
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:27,920
Well.

415
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,359
Why don't I recommend you something?

416
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,880
That's all right. I got it.

417
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,880
Or you can just point
at one of the photos.

418
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,799
I'll take

419
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,599
the green asparagus velouté,

420
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:56,839
Scottish smoked salmon rillettes,

421
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,680
and... What's it called again?
I've been craving it.

422
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,279
Hold on.

423
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:05,799
Give me the wild mushroom
and tarragon risotto

424
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,960
and an order of
moules marinière too.

425
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:12,000
Oh, right. The meal is not complete
without this dish.

426
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:14,279
- Do you have grilled bread?
- Yes.

427
00:32:14,359 --> 00:32:16,599
Great. Serve that one first.

428
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,440
I love garlic bread.

429
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:21,880
It's salty and perfectly balanced
when dipped in soup.

430
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:25,519
- Give me two. One for my daughter.
- Yes.

431
00:32:26,079 --> 00:32:29,519
I didn't expect you
to have a taste for French food.

432
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:30,599
Is that so?

433
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,279
Well.

434
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,440
I used to work
at the French embassy.

435
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,160
Were you a diplomat?

436
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,680
No, I was their gardener.

437
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:43,759
I used to pay for my tuition

438
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:47,759
by doing part-time
gardening jobs at many embassies,

439
00:32:47,839 --> 00:32:51,799
such as French, Belgian, German,
English, and S...

440
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:54,200
- The Swiss embassy?
- Sa Kaeo Province.

441
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:58,279
It was back when
I was living out of town.

442
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,880
Did you really do all that?
Or was it just a joke?

443
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:11,519
Do you think I'm the type
of person to speak nonsense?

444
00:33:14,319 --> 00:33:15,319
That's right.

445
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:16,960
It was just a joke.

446
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:23,400
The truth is I love cooking shows

447
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,599
both on TV and online.

448
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:28,559
I got a chance to watch

449
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,720
the news

450
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:36,200
about you often getting involved
with young celebrities.

451
00:33:38,319 --> 00:33:41,079
Let me ask you something,
man to man.

452
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,359
Are you interested in my daughter?

453
00:33:47,079 --> 00:33:48,519
What if I was?

454
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,319
Would you give me your blessings?

455
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,079
No.

456
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,480
Because of the news?

457
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:56,440
No, because you are immoral.

458
00:33:56,519 --> 00:33:57,920
You know

459
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,640
that Pa is legally married,

460
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,519
yet here you are
trying to hit on her.

461
00:34:03,599 --> 00:34:05,400
Who does that?

462
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,769
Pa might have a thing
for someone like me.

463
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,440
That's why she asked me out
for dinner tonight.

464
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:15,119
Is that so?
Someone's obviously got a big head.

465
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,039
Pa only asked you out today

466
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:20,119
because she wants
to find out Madame's secret.

467
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:22,079
Did you say Madame's secret?

468
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:32,679
Call me back asap, Dad.

469
00:34:35,559 --> 00:34:36,880
Please excuse me.

470
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,679
Okay.

471
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,679
Darn it!

472
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,329
Gosh.

473
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,400
Dao called to ask

474
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:57,519
when we're going home.
She has a stomachache.

475
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:02,769
Where's Mr. Singkorn?

476
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,119
What is it, Lita?

477
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:08,289
Dad, the social media influencers
from America

478
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,840
that we are supposed
to meet in two days

479
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,559
suddenly canceled the meeting.

480
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:14,809
What? Why?

481
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,239
They didn't say why.

482
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,719
But I heard they went to talk
business with Noppadol's company,

483
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:21,880
our competitor.

484
00:35:27,679 --> 00:35:28,960
(Singkorn)

485
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:34,559
(Singkorn)

486
00:35:38,329 --> 00:35:39,329
Hello.

487
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,239
How much did Noppadol bribe you

488
00:35:41,329 --> 00:35:45,360
to get the influencers from America
to go to his company instead?

489
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:50,360
Why are you making a fuss
over such a tiny problem?

490
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,360
How can I not?

491
00:35:52,519 --> 00:35:55,039
I've prepared a party
to welcome them.

492
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:58,880
Why don't you hire
Thai influencers instead?

493
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,769
They can promote your company

494
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:06,440
as well as influencers
from America can.

495
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:09,679
Forget it. I'm not in the mood
to welcome anyone.

496
00:36:10,159 --> 00:36:12,599
I want to know
why you are betraying me.

497
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,559
It happens

498
00:36:14,639 --> 00:36:17,809
to be my first time
working with Noppadol.

499
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:21,000
I want to make
a good first impression.

500
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,880
By betraying me?

501
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:26,239
It's normal for us

502
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:28,920
to betray each other, isn't it?

503
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,360
Why did you do that, Dad?

504
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:50,159
Why did you tell Mr. Singkorn

505
00:36:50,159 --> 00:36:52,809
that I'm here to get him
to spill her secret?

506
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,679
He said you had a thing for him,

507
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:58,119
- and I lost it.
- Come on, Dad.

508
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:00,199
Let him say whatever he wants.

509
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,289
Now that he knows the truth,

510
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:05,719
not only will it be difficult
to get the secret out of him,

511
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:10,000
but he might also
tell Madame about it.

512
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,440
Don't worry about it.

513
00:37:15,809 --> 00:37:17,329
I'll shut him up.

514
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:18,639
Sure, you will.

515
00:37:19,199 --> 00:37:21,840
I'm good at forcing people
to do stuff for me.

516
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,199
- I will...
- Put it down.

517
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,679
You are going to make it worse.

518
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,639
Stop.

519
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,840
Put it down.

520
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,519
He might see you. Put it down.

521
00:37:48,519 --> 00:37:51,039
You want to know
Madame Nuan's secret, don't you?

522
00:37:58,159 --> 00:37:59,960
- Madame had an affair?
- Madame had an affair?

523
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:02,719
Yes.

524
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:06,809
It happened a long time ago.

525
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,360
I was close with Krit,
Madame's husband.

526
00:38:11,809 --> 00:38:14,920
Krit suspected
Madame was having an affair.

527
00:38:15,079 --> 00:38:17,329
He decided to follow her to a hotel.

528
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,440
Keep the change.

529
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,480
Adisorn...

530
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,000
Krit.

531
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,480
Krit.

532
00:38:56,719 --> 00:38:58,679
Krit, hear me out.

533
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,960
Krit, hear me out.

534
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:04,639
I should have listened to my mother.

535
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:06,480
She told me not to trust you.

536
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:08,639
I shouldn't believe
anything you say.

537
00:39:09,199 --> 00:39:10,480
You can't be trusted at all.

538
00:39:11,039 --> 00:39:12,199
Why?

539
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,960
Is it because I'm going bankrupt?

540
00:39:15,769 --> 00:39:18,000
No. Not at all.

541
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:23,400
Krit!

542
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,039
Krit!

543
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:30,360
Hear me out first!

544
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,289
Soon after that,
Krit died of a broken heart

545
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:42,769
and Madame Nuan
took over his business.

546
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:48,039
Since Krit never told a soul that
Madame Nuan was cheating on him,

547
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:52,880
his death led to the rumor that
Madame Nuan killed him for money.

548
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:56,880
Why are you telling us about this?

549
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:02,159
Because Nadedao told Lita,
my daughter,

550
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:07,360
about how Madame stole your phone
to discover your secrets.

551
00:40:08,519 --> 00:40:10,199
I think she crossed the line.

552
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,119
You deserve

553
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,039
to know some of her secrets
to get back at her.

554
00:40:18,159 --> 00:40:21,519
What Madame Nuan
is doing to you is nothing...

555
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:27,039
compared to what she did
to Srikanda.

556
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,480
What did she do to Da?

557
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:33,199
Tell me.

558
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:35,239
It's best that I don't say.

559
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:43,159
Madame Nuan is receiving
the Strong Woman Award tomorrow.

560
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:48,840
No one knows that Madame Nuan
got her title as a strong woman

561
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:52,769
at the expense
of Srikanda's tearful face.

562
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,719
Dad, you told Pa
Madame Nuan's secret.

563
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,239
Aren't you afraid it's going to
affect the Health Plus project?

564
00:41:31,769 --> 00:41:33,400
It's worth losing one project

565
00:41:33,769 --> 00:41:35,880
in exchange for the chance
to teach Madame Nuan

566
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:37,599
a lesson.

567
00:41:38,679 --> 00:41:41,329
By the way, what is the secret?

568
00:41:44,719 --> 00:41:48,920
You can find out when Pa exposes
her secret at the ceremony tomorrow.

569
00:41:49,769 --> 00:41:50,960
It's more fun that way.

570
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,289
Ms. Pa, you are back.

571
00:42:09,079 --> 00:42:10,329
Where's your father?

572
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,440
He's in the kitchen cleansing
his palate from the greasy food.

573
00:42:13,809 --> 00:42:16,480
How's your stomachache?
Do you feel better now?

574
00:42:16,559 --> 00:42:18,960
No, I still feel sick.

575
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:20,880
I ate some bad mangoes earlier.

576
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,159
Mr. Nai's been taking care of Nick.

577
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:26,639
They were both asleep
when I checked on them just now.

578
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,519
Keep your secrets safe, Pawinee.

579
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,559
Because once I find out about them,

580
00:43:05,639 --> 00:43:07,559
the world will also find out,

581
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,159
including your dad.

582
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,440
You're going to end up

583
00:43:13,769 --> 00:43:15,679
in a living hell because of them.

584
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:31,360
Yes, Pa.

585
00:43:31,559 --> 00:43:34,519
Do you know the organizer
of the Strong Woman Award ceremony?

586
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:36,360
Yes.

587
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:39,000
I've worked with her a few times.

588
00:43:39,809 --> 00:43:42,280
Is everything all right?
I can talk to her if you want.

589
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,639
Madame Nuan will be receiving
her award tomorrow.

590
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:49,920
Why don't we go there
to congratulate her?

591
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:05,800
Hello.

592
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,239
Sure.

593
00:44:13,679 --> 00:44:15,480
Today is an important day for me.

594
00:44:15,679 --> 00:44:17,239
So I won't ask much from you.

595
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,840
I only need both of you

596
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:21,079
to behave.

597
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,679
Don't humiliate me.

598
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,079
Nade.

599
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:28,800
Have you memorized your interview?

600
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,000
Me?

601
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,840
It's all a misunderstanding.

602
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:36,960
The angle...

603
00:44:37,199 --> 00:44:41,199
The angle makes it look like
Trai and I were kissing,

604
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,000
but something got into his eye.

605
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:49,760
His eye was hurting,
so I tried to help him get it out.

606
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,679
Good job.

607
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:58,960
Mom, what if the reporters
ask me more questions?

608
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:02,599
The media loves writing
scoops on relationships.

609
00:45:05,239 --> 00:45:06,920
Find a way to avoid those questions.

610
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:10,000
How?

611
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,320
Sing them a song instead.

612
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,440
Please excuse me.

613
00:45:28,159 --> 00:45:30,920
- Hello, Madame.
- Hello.

614
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,679
I'm Am, the founder
of the Strong Woman page.

615
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,400
Am.

616
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:39,199
Thank you very much for choosing me.

617
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:43,559
You owe your gratitude
to the judges.

618
00:45:43,639 --> 00:45:46,119
They voted for you unanimously.

619
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,840
Singkorn.

620
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,599
You are here too.

621
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:58,000
Of course.

622
00:45:58,559 --> 00:46:00,920
I had to come and congratulate you.

623
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:07,199
Singkorn is the main sponsor
of this event, Madame.

624
00:46:08,039 --> 00:46:12,519
May I invite both of you to take
a photo in front of the backdrop?

625
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,400
This way please.

626
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,000
This way.

627
00:46:29,159 --> 00:46:32,480
Nai, I need to talk to you
about something.

628
00:46:33,559 --> 00:46:35,159
Sure.

629
00:46:37,360 --> 00:46:39,440
Let's head inside.

630
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:41,039
Please excuse us.

631
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:42,840
This way please.

632
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,679
Nadedao, can we interview you?

633
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:51,280
- Of course, let's go.
- Follow me.

634
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,079
- This way.
- Thank you.

635
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:00,599
Nadedao, please explain
the leaked clip.

636
00:47:04,519 --> 00:47:05,760
Sure.

637
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:08,280
It's all a misunderstanding.

638
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,199
The angle makes it look like
Trai and I were kissing,

639
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,800
but something got into his eye.

640
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:17,800
His eye was hurting,
so I tried to help him get it out.

641
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,360
I see.

642
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:23,559
Did it have to do with your catfight
with Nai's wife's friend?

643
00:47:23,639 --> 00:47:25,760
- That's right.
- Please answer us.

644
00:47:28,119 --> 00:47:29,800
- So?
- Please answer.

645
00:47:30,519 --> 00:47:31,639
Well...

646
00:47:32,239 --> 00:47:33,239
Did it have to do with that?

647
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:35,559
Please tell us.

648
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:39,960
If you don't know what to say,
sing them a song instead.

649
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:46,079
Stems and leaves,
oh, yeah, leaves and stems.

650
00:47:46,559 --> 00:47:50,360
Stems and leaves,
oh, yeah, leaves and stems.

651
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:53,960
It's really raining.

652
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:56,679
Oh, yeah, stems and leaves.

653
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:01,400
Are you aware that Pa had dinner
with my father yesterday?

654
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:02,840
Yes, I am.

655
00:48:04,039 --> 00:48:07,119
Did Pa tell you anything?

656
00:48:10,199 --> 00:48:11,960
Is there anything
you wish to tell me?

657
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,320
My father and Pa were talking
about your mother.

658
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,079
I want you to know that...

659
00:48:17,159 --> 00:48:20,440
Madame might try
to sabotage Pa's project.

660
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,760
Lita is a little worried, Nai.

661
00:48:28,519 --> 00:48:31,280
Pa's working
for my company after all.

662
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,639
I told you that
I know Madame Nuan well.

663
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:41,719
She's professional enough

664
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,360
not to let her personal issues
affect her work.

665
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:48,440
Am I right, Nai?

666
00:48:49,239 --> 00:48:50,239
Yes.

667
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:54,199
Come on, let's go inside.

668
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:08,559
Lita.

669
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,599
Why did you try to warn Nai?

670
00:49:11,079 --> 00:49:14,159
Because I know what it feels like
to keep a secret.

671
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,360
No one wants their secret
to be exposed in public.

672
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,840
Be patient.

673
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,960
Don't try to get in my way again.

674
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:25,880
I'm not only doing this
to get back at Madame Nuan.

675
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:27,559
I'm also doing this for you.

676
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:31,239
After Pa exposes
Madame Nuan's secret,

677
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,360
Nai's going to be furious with Pa.

678
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:35,679
There's going to be hope
for you and Nai again.

679
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:54,480
Yes, Thom.
I'm walking up the stairs.

680
00:49:55,360 --> 00:49:56,960
I'm going inside first.

681
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:14,760
I'll share the restaurant
location with you.

682
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,719
See you at 8 p.m. tonight.

683
00:50:17,039 --> 00:50:20,079
I can't wait to eat
stir-fried chives with you.

684
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:24,920
You can't go.

685
00:50:26,519 --> 00:50:30,000
Tom, how rude of you
to be spying on me.

686
00:50:30,639 --> 00:50:32,159
I don't mind getting insulted

687
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:35,599
if it will save Trai
from getting killed by your mother.

688
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,360
If you want what's best for Trai,

689
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,000
you must get over him.

690
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,480
I know.

691
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:45,320
After you.

692
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,559
The event has begun.

693
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,880
- Thom, hello.
- Hello, Am.

694
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:07,880
Pa is already here.
She's inside talking to the staff.

695
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:11,119
Thank you very much
for your cooperation.

696
00:51:11,199 --> 00:51:12,559
You are welcome.

697
00:51:13,079 --> 00:51:14,920
I should go inside.

698
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,400
Yes, please head this way.

699
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:17,840
- Thank you very much.
- No problem.

700
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,880
- Am.
- Yes, Singkorn.

701
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:29,400
Do you know Thomtawee?

702
00:51:29,719 --> 00:51:31,199
Yes, I do.

703
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:34,599
He asked me for a small favor.

704
00:51:34,679 --> 00:51:37,880
I agreed to help him
since it's going to get our event

705
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:39,480
widely known.

706
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:44,400
Would you mind sharing the details

707
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:45,639
with your sponsor?

708
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:47,880
Of course not.

709
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,920
Pawinee,
Madame Nuan's daughter-in-law,

710
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:53,039
will be presenting Madame Nuan
with a surprise.

711
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,559
It's almost time.

712
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:57,800
I'm going to spread
the word to the reporters.

713
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,599
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

714
00:53:17,639 --> 00:53:20,320
Madame Nuan's surely going to be
the star of tonight's event.

715
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:26,800
I think I'm going to go home.

716
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:29,360
You should stay.

717
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:33,880
I hear Pawinee is about
to make her move.

718
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,039
I should go.

719
00:53:36,519 --> 00:53:40,199
I still want to be able to look at
Madame, Nade, and Nai in the eye.

720
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,119
I can't watch this.

721
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:32,320
Lita.

722
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,039
Why are you running from me?

723
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,800
I'm not running from you.

724
00:54:49,079 --> 00:54:51,440
I didn't know you were following me.

725
00:54:52,719 --> 00:54:55,960
Do you know that
you are a really bad liar?

726
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:03,920
What do you want from me?

727
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,760
About our conversation earlier,

728
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:08,280
you are not just worried

729
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,079
about my mother sabotaging
the Health Plus project, are you?

730
00:55:13,199 --> 00:55:14,760
I think there's more to it.

731
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,440
And I'm certain
that it's very important.

732
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:24,440
No, there's nothing more.

733
00:55:24,639 --> 00:55:27,320
My dad has already
told you everything.

734
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:30,000
I don't believe you.

735
00:55:45,159 --> 00:55:47,239
And this show is called

736
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:49,840
"I Am Stronger".

737
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,960
Wasn't that impressive?

738
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:58,199
However, our surprises today
don't end here.

739
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:01,440
We are going to introduce to you

740
00:56:01,519 --> 00:56:06,840
the first woman to win our award.

741
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,800
Today, we have a special guest

742
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:14,280
who will be delivering
Madame Nuan a gift.

743
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,480
Most importantly,

744
00:56:15,519 --> 00:56:21,559
she's going to attest to
Madame Nuan's true personality.

745
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:24,519
Do you remember when this happened?

746
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:29,920
You are one lucky girl.

747
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,400
My mom always gives people
a second chance.

748
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,480
A second chance?

749
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:38,639
Don't give it to me.
I don't want it.

750
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,400
You don't want a second chance?
What do you want then?

751
00:56:44,840 --> 00:56:46,920
I want your love.

752
00:56:48,159 --> 00:56:49,800
I hope

753
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,960
you love

754
00:56:53,199 --> 00:56:54,639
and adore me.

755
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:00,239
- Please take pictures.
- Please let us take some photos.

756
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,840
Good.

757
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,840
Because I'm your new
daughter-in-law.

758
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:07,280
What?

759
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:09,119
- Her new daughter-in-law?
- Daughter-in-law?

760
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:14,079
Please give a warm welcome
to our special guest,

761
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:16,360
Ms. Pawinee,

762
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,360
Madame Nuan's
beautiful daughter-in-law.

763
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:54,920
Congratulations, Mother.

764
00:57:56,639 --> 00:57:59,360
May I ask what you brought with you?

765
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:00,920
Oh.

766
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:02,639
It's a special gift

767
00:58:02,800 --> 00:58:05,679
I prepared specifically for you.

768
00:58:10,039 --> 00:58:11,039
That's fine.

769
00:58:12,519 --> 00:58:14,280
You don't need to tell me.

770
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:18,559
If you are certain
it's not going to bother you later,

771
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,320
I will respect your decision.

772
00:58:25,679 --> 00:58:28,039
Pa's going to expose
your mother's secret.

773
00:58:33,360 --> 00:58:34,559
What secret?

774
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:38,719
I don't know what the secret is.
My dad wouldn't tell me.

775
00:58:38,840 --> 00:58:40,679
But he told the secret to Pa,

776
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,480
and Pa is now inside the hall.

777
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:47,960
Let's find out together

778
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:52,440
what this special gift is.

779
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,119
Don't do it, Pa.

780
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:26,519
Wow.

781
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:30,880
I bought you a diamond necklace.

782
00:59:36,199 --> 00:59:38,320
That's amazing.
Please give a round of applause.

783
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:40,960
The diamond is gigantic.

784
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:42,920
May I ask

785
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,559
the value of the necklace?

786
00:59:45,639 --> 00:59:47,320
Gosh.

787
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,360
I would rather not say.

788
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:53,119
However, this necklace

789
00:59:53,199 --> 00:59:56,079
is perfect for my mother-in-law.

790
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:59,199
Can I put it on her now?

791
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,280
Sure.

792
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:05,880
It's beautiful.

793
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:10,960
Excuse me, Mother.

794
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:16,159
Look at the size of the diamond.

795
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,280
Isn't it beautiful?

796
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:24,239
This necklace

797
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:27,840
is perfect for you
because it's fake.

798
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:34,039
It's fake but looks genuine.

799
01:00:35,079 --> 01:00:37,679
You can't tell by the naked eye
that it's fake.

800
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,840
Keep smiling.

801
01:00:41,239 --> 01:00:46,280
If anyone finds out I bought you
a fake necklace,

802
01:00:47,719 --> 01:00:49,920
you will be extremely humiliated.

803
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:55,079
Wow, it's beautiful, Mother.

804
01:00:55,159 --> 01:00:56,599
It's really beautiful.

805
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:58,760
It's beautiful and touching
at the same time.

806
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:00,599
May I invite

807
01:01:00,679 --> 01:01:05,000
Ms. Nadedao and Mr. Noppanai,

808
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:08,639
Madame Nuan's children,
on stage for some pictures?

809
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,079
Please come up on stage.

810
01:01:21,719 --> 01:01:23,039
Smile... Good.

811
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:28,079
They look like a happy family.

812
01:01:28,719 --> 01:01:31,320
The love and strong bond

813
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,679
within Madame Nuan's family must be
the factors behind her success.

814
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,119
It's really touching.

815
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:38,840
Please clap for them again.

816
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:45,159
- Can we do our favorite pose?
- Sure.

817
01:01:47,199 --> 01:01:49,880
Her family is adorable.

818
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,239
Love and a strong bond within
a family are very important.

819
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:56,159
These factors must have pushed
Madame Nuan

820
01:01:56,239 --> 01:02:00,000
to win this year's
Strong Woman Award.

821
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,559
Wow.

822
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:32,760
I bought you a diamond necklace.

823
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:40,039
Pa didn't expose
Madame Nuan's secret.

824
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:47,719
Dad must be disappointed.

825
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:58,280
Pa.

826
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:01,119
Why did you try to please my mother?

827
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:02,840
What are you trying to do?

828
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:09,039
I want to give Madame Nuan
a good reputation.

829
01:03:09,519 --> 01:03:13,159
She's one of Thom's Health Plus
presenters after all.

830
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:16,639
By putting Madame Nuan's
good name on social media,

831
01:03:16,719 --> 01:03:19,320
it will help promote
Health Plus's launch event.

832
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:32,679
What else?

833
01:03:33,639 --> 01:03:34,920
What do you mean?

834
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,559
I don't believe you.

835
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:41,159
You know my mother's secret.

836
01:03:43,400 --> 01:03:44,840
Who told you that?

837
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:46,320
You don't need to know.

838
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,960
Tell me now

839
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:51,920
what you are planning to do
with her secret.

840
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:54,159
What kind of person

841
01:03:54,679 --> 01:03:56,159
do you take me for?

842
01:03:56,639 --> 01:03:59,760
My mother tried to use
your secret to take you down.

843
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:03,239
You definitely have a plan for hers.

844
01:04:05,920 --> 01:04:07,480
I admit

845
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,880
I had a plan to get back at her.

846
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,440
I knew it. Why...

847
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,320
Let me finish.

848
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:18,239
But I chose not to do it

849
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:20,880
because of you.

850
01:04:24,559 --> 01:04:25,800
Because of me?

851
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:27,960
Yes.

852
01:04:29,159 --> 01:04:31,199
You agreed to divorce me

853
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,360
and give me what I want
for Nick's sake.

854
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,599
I'm doing this for Nick's sake too.

855
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:43,440
If I exposed Madame Nuan's
secret to the public

856
01:04:43,559 --> 01:04:45,760
and it ended up on social media,

857
01:04:46,360 --> 01:04:49,960
it would stay on the internet
forever for Nick to see.

858
01:04:50,199 --> 01:04:52,400
And Nick would think badly
of his aunt

859
01:04:52,519 --> 01:04:55,519
for exposing his grandmother's
secret to the world.

860
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:01,079
My dad and I have agreed

861
01:05:01,639 --> 01:05:03,639
to forget what we were told.

862
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:07,360
We might want to see
Madame Nuan suffer

863
01:05:07,800 --> 01:05:10,360
the same way
she made us suffer with Da,

864
01:05:11,440 --> 01:05:13,280
but I'm a woman

865
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,599
and my dad has daughters.

866
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:18,519
If it was the other way around,

867
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:20,440
we wouldn't want anyone

868
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:23,679
to expose our secret either, Nai.

869
01:05:31,559 --> 01:05:32,960
Thank you very much

870
01:05:33,559 --> 01:05:35,320
for not destroying my family.

871
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,960
Thank you for reminding me

872
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:42,199
to do the right thing.

873
01:06:05,239 --> 01:06:06,400
I admit

874
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:10,280
that if I had to start over
with someone,

875
01:06:11,719 --> 01:06:13,119
I'd want that person to be Pa.

876
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,599
But Pa doesn't like me.

877
01:06:19,239 --> 01:06:20,880
But if you don't do anything,

878
01:06:21,519 --> 01:06:23,239
not only will you lose Ms. Pa,

879
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:26,920
you will also be heartbroken,
regret your effort and time,

880
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:29,199
and go crazy when you see her
with another man.

881
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,320
Won't that be worse?

882
01:06:36,239 --> 01:06:37,239
Pa.

883
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:45,599
I don't doubt you anymore.

884
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,199
Now, I'm questioning myself.

885
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,280
Why I'm scared?

886
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,599
I must not fear anything.
I can do this.

887
01:06:58,679 --> 01:06:59,920
I'm going to go for you.

888
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,039
I'm going to go for you

889
01:07:15,079 --> 01:07:18,159
and make you fall in love with me.
Just wait and see.

890
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,320
Nai...

891
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:32,239
Come with me.

892
01:07:40,559 --> 01:07:42,559
Gosh, Nai.

893
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:45,400
What kind of married couple
announces that?

894
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:46,960
- Well.
- What?

895
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:50,039
The kind of couple that got married
for reasons other than love.

896
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:55,280
You said you would be going for me.

897
01:07:55,960 --> 01:07:57,239
But what about Da?

898
01:07:57,639 --> 01:07:59,119
Have you forgotten about her?

899
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,239
No.

900
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:06,480
I will never forget her.

901
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,159
She will always be in my heart.

902
01:08:11,239 --> 01:08:13,679
But Nick and I
must keep going forward.

903
01:08:14,639 --> 01:08:16,920
I want to choose what's best

904
01:08:17,039 --> 01:08:19,479
for me and my son.

905
01:08:22,159 --> 01:08:23,680
And that's you.

906
01:08:30,439 --> 01:08:34,159
In ten seconds,
it will be 05:10 p.m.

907
01:08:35,239 --> 01:08:36,680
That's a good number.

908
01:08:37,569 --> 01:08:40,039
It's the perfect time to win
a beautiful girl's heart.

909
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:41,720
Wow.

910
01:08:41,840 --> 01:08:44,159
Who taught you that?

911
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:45,399
I taught myself.

912
01:08:45,569 --> 01:08:47,680
- Really?
- I came up with it,

913
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,880
and I'm loving it.

914
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:54,649
Four, three, two, one.

915
01:08:55,279 --> 01:08:56,319
Oh my gosh.

916
01:08:56,399 --> 01:08:59,199
Everyone, I'm going
to hit on this woman.

917
01:08:59,279 --> 01:09:02,609
- Put me down, Nai.
- Everyone, I'm going to hit on her.

918
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,479
- Nai, put me down.
- Everyone.

919
01:09:04,569 --> 01:09:07,319
I know a lot of people here.
Put me down.

920
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:08,720
Put me down.

921
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:14,119
- Do you know a lot of people here?
- Yes.

922
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:15,760
But I want them to know.

923
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:18,569
No, you don't need to tell them.

924
01:09:19,319 --> 01:09:20,319
Fine.

925
01:09:21,159 --> 01:09:22,399
So can I go for you?

926
01:09:58,159 --> 01:09:59,960
- Where are you taking her?
- Stay out of this!

927
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,079
I'm going to move forward
and try to win Pa's heart.

928
01:10:03,079 --> 01:10:04,199
You don't have my permission!

929
01:10:04,279 --> 01:10:05,609
I'm not here to ask
for your permission.

930
01:10:05,680 --> 01:10:07,359
You need to defeat Nai!

931
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:10,159
Hey, what are you doing?

932
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:11,680
You have to trust me.

933
01:10:12,279 --> 01:10:14,569
- What is this money for?
- Break up with my son.

934
01:10:14,649 --> 01:10:16,479
Don't stay here
and let me hate your guts.

935
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:17,840
I'd like you to be prepared

936
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:20,960
because I'm going to convince
everyone to leave you soon.

937
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:23,609
That's great.
So other people will find out

938
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:26,720
the lovely mother-in-law image
you've created

939
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,039
was all a lie.
