1
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,280
Let's go visit that guy's family.

2
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:36,879
The one I hit with my car?

3
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,400
They might be lovers.

4
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,090
These are toilet cleaning supplies.

5
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:43,280
They're for anyone accusing
my daughter of having an affair.

6
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,400
Use them to clean your mouth.

7
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:47,039
I'm going to call for dad.
You'll lose your head for sure.

8
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,080
You might lose your mind first.

9
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,400
Get inside Pa's bedroom

10
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:51,639
and search the whole place.

11
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,719
I'm sure there must be some kind
of secret about her and Thomtawee.

12
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,319
The only person I'll give permission
to follow me around

13
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,199
is my daughter-in-law.

14
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,919
You have to accept the job
and follow my mom around.

15
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,560
I think we'd kill each other

16
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:04,400
if we were in close proximity.

17
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:12,199
Ms. Nade.

18
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,439
Why didn't you knock?

19
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:20,560
I figured you couldn't open the door
due to your injured leg.

20
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,960
How's your leg doing?

21
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:24,879
Listen.

22
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,639
Ms. Nade.

23
00:03:28,199 --> 00:03:30,319
I'm glad you are here.
I've been meaning to talk to you.

24
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:33,199
We need to talk.

25
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,639
No, ladies first.

26
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,199
Let me do what I came to do first.

27
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,680
Jai.

28
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,319
Coming.

29
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,560
Take a seat.

30
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:53,879
Come on.

31
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,360
Your leg might be getting better,
but you shouldn't overuse it.

32
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:58,599
Follow me.

33
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:00,159
Yes.

34
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:01,960
Hurry up, Jai.

35
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,800
Yes, I'm right behind you.

36
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,639
- Quickly.
- Coming.

37
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,680
Quickly.

38
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,479
Jai.

39
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,199
- What's she planning to do?
- I don't know.

40
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
She ordered me
to put you in a wheelchair.

41
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,920
- Jai.
- Yes.

42
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,560
- Hurry up.
- Coming.

43
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,920
Are you okay?

44
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes.

45
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:23,240
I can do this!

46
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,730
I'm about to fall off.

47
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,170
Can you really do this?

48
00:04:35,399 --> 00:04:37,680
Gosh, Jai, you took forever.

49
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:39,610
Are you okay, Trai?

50
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:40,879
Yes.

51
00:04:41,279 --> 00:04:42,360
Follow me.

52
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,879
- Faster, Jai.
- Yes.

53
00:05:04,439 --> 00:05:05,800
Are you not done yet?

54
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,959
I'm finishing up.

55
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,480
Get ready.

56
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,639
Ta-da.

57
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:18,920
The dressing room is huge.

58
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,050
There's an en suite bathroom.

59
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,879
And a wall-mounted TV.

60
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,439
A touch lamp,
but you need to plug it in first.

61
00:05:26,519 --> 00:05:28,759
And a bed with silk sheets.

62
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,120
You got injured

63
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,600
from trying to save my life.

64
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,199
I asked my mother,

65
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:43,920
and she agreed to let you stay here
until you fully recover.

66
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,519
I can stay here?

67
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,120
Yes.

68
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,319
The food you ordered
has been delivered.

69
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,560
I know sick people
don't usually have an appetite.

70
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,800
So I ordered you food from
a Michelin-starred restaurant.

71
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,240
Put the food on a plate
and serve it to Trai.

72
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,279
Go, Tang.

73
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,920
Yes.

74
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,920
- Jai, Sompit,
- Yes.

75
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,519
bring Trai's belongings and clothes

76
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,800
up to the room.

77
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,519
- Yes.
- Yes.

78
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:42,600
Move it.

79
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,120
- Jai.
- What?

80
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,199
Hey.

81
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,920
Has Trai got Ms. Nate
under a spell or something?

82
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,519
How would I know?

83
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:54,519
Hey.

84
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,439
How long are you going
to stand there?

85
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:58,600
Ms. Nadedao is going
to throw a tantrum. Come on!

86
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,920
I've got a reward for you,

87
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,000
my hero.

88
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,800
Ta-da.

89
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,399
It's 50,000 baht.

90
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,920
Did you say 50,000 baht?

91
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,720
Well, I've given you
everything I prepared for you.

92
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,959
You were going to tell me
something earlier. What was it?

93
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,600
Well.

94
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,439
I was going to tell you that...

95
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,040
That?

96
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,079
I feel extremely guilty

97
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,879
for failing to lead you to Pa.

98
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,040
Listen to you.

99
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:47,199
You deserve

100
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,120
another reward.

101
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,720
Is it an additional 10,000 baht?

102
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,800
It's a kiss.

103
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Yes!

104
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:16,120
I'm going to enjoy
the moment while it lasts.

105
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,759
Who are you meeting today?

106
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,160
The owner of the advertising
company we hired.

107
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:33,720
Why did you ask me
to come with you then?

108
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:37,279
Because we are going
to talk about you.

109
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,519
Hello.

110
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,360
Thom?

111
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:20,480
How's the Health Plus
advertisement going?

112
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:24,279
Our team is selecting
the three female presenters.

113
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,159
One of them is Madame Nuan.

114
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,639
But we still need two more.

115
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:30,759
We are going to select two women.

116
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,240
Then you can make
the final decision.

117
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,720
Will you take Lita
under your consideration?

118
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Dad.

119
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:41,559
What?

120
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:43,559
Why do you look so surprised?

121
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,240
My daughter has got
the looks and the brain.

122
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,090
She has the qualifications
to be considered a strong woman.

123
00:09:49,559 --> 00:09:50,679
But I don't want...

124
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:51,960
If you

125
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,720
take my daughter
under your consideration,

126
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:58,639
I will offer you
all the support you need.

127
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:01,919
Dad.

128
00:10:11,919 --> 00:10:14,639
I'm sorry.
This call is quite important.

129
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,450
I have to get it.

130
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:29,450
Why are you doing this?

131
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,840
If you become famous
and your name is in the news,

132
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:36,679
Madame Nuan will want you
as her daughter-in-law more.

133
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,679
I know Madame Nuan.

134
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,519
She doesn't give a darn
about a nobody

135
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,879
who can't help her business.

136
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:47,919
Take Srikanda for an example.

137
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,480
What if people start digging

138
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,159
about me and Peter
after I become famous?

139
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,639
Does anyone else know

140
00:10:56,759 --> 00:10:58,960
about you and Peter besides me?

141
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,320
I don't know.

142
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:03,840
But there are no secrets
in the world.

143
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,200
Exactly.

144
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:07,519
That's why I'm practically
offering you

145
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,679
to Madame Nuan
before your secret is revealed.

146
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,360
Lita.

147
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,000
Don't cry.

148
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,399
Crying won't solve anything.

149
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,799
Stay strong like I did.

150
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,120
Do as I say,
and you will live a good life.

151
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,159
Approach Thom

152
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,720
and show him

153
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,840
that you've got what it takes
to be a strong woman.

154
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,879
That way, I won't have to use
my connections to get you picked.

155
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,759
I have to go.

156
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,919
Stay and talk to Thom.

157
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:34,879
I know you hate
what your father is trying to do.

158
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,639
I get it.

159
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm against people
who use connections too.

160
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:44,080
I was pregnant once.

161
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,080
I accidentally got pregnant

162
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,679
while I was studying abroad.

163
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,480
But my boyfriend
didn't want the baby.

164
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,960
We had a fight,

165
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,879
and he caused me
to have a miscarriage.

166
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,240
It's okay.

167
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,559
My father is doing everything
to hide my past

168
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,879
and get Madame Nuan

169
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:25,039
to take me in
as her daughter-in-law.

170
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,960
I obey his orders...

171
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:37,080
because I don't want
to let him down anymore.

172
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,480
Why did you decide

173
00:13:41,799 --> 00:13:44,639
to tell me about this?

174
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,720
My father wanted me to show you

175
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:52,000
what a strong woman I am.

176
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,279
So I thought

177
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,600
it would be best

178
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,399
to tell you the truth.

179
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,960
Anyway,

180
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:04,200
please take me
under your consideration.

181
00:14:06,559 --> 00:14:08,519
You get to benefit

182
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,720
from my father's support,

183
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,279
and I get to not let him down.

184
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,799
Check if I got everything.

185
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,840
Let me see. Milk,

186
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,159
diapers,

187
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,440
vegetables, and fish.

188
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,120
Yes, you got everything.

189
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,159
Thank you for buying these for me.

190
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,799
Thom.

191
00:14:54,799 --> 00:14:57,120
- Thom.
- Yes, Pa.

192
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,600
What's on your mind?

193
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:00,840
I was thinking about work.

194
00:15:01,399 --> 00:15:02,799
You can talk to me.

195
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,759
You are paying me after all.

196
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:07,039
I know.

197
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,039
Thom, you stay here

198
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,360
while I put this stuff away.
My dad will come down soon.

199
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,679
Okay.

200
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,679
Thom.

201
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:25,480
Good morning, sir.

202
00:15:25,559 --> 00:15:27,080
Good morning. Where's Pa?

203
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,039
- Pa's in the kitchen.
- I see.

204
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,519
I bought a lot of stuff for Nick.

205
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,600
Good.

206
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,960
Where's Nick?

207
00:15:36,879 --> 00:15:38,240
Upstairs with his father.

208
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,399
- Which one?
- What are you doing?

209
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:45,159
I'm choosing an amulet
for Pa to keep on her.

210
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,840
I hear her job with
that sick hag starts tomorrow.

211
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,440
She needs an amulet for protection.

212
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:51,799
What about this one?

213
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,960
Sir, can I ask you something?

214
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:01,519
Sure.

215
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,320
How did you feel when you found out

216
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,600
Da got pregnant before marriage?

217
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,679
Well...

218
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,679
The news

219
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:17,600
put me

220
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,879
under a lot of stress.

221
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,960
I felt completely lost.

222
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,879
But luckily,

223
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,440
it was Da's summer vacation.

224
00:16:25,879 --> 00:16:27,639
So she came home to be with me.

225
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,320
It gave me the strength
to pull myself together.

226
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,440
Or I'd have gone down a dark path.

227
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:37,919
Did you ever try
to control Da's life?

228
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:39,799
What do you mean?

229
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,120
Did you ever force Da

230
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,879
to do something
you thought was best for her

231
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,759
instead of letting her choose
her own path?

232
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,440
For instance,

233
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,960
finding Da a good guy
to cover up her past.

234
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:55,639
Never.

235
00:16:57,039 --> 00:17:00,600
No matter how many times
a child screws up,

236
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,600
it's still their life.

237
00:17:02,919 --> 00:17:04,170
They must learn from their mistakes.

238
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,839
Parents who think they get to decide
everything for their kids are crazy.

239
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,039
Did your baby beg you

240
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:17,410
to sleep with your lover
so it would be born?

241
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,519
No.

242
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,200
You created a life,

243
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:23,920
so then you want to control
the baby's life too?

244
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,319
Parents who do that
are very selfish.

245
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,000
I wish Lita's father was like you.

246
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,410
What did you say?

247
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,240
I mean Da and Pa
are so lucky to have you

248
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:37,799
as their father.

249
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,279
You can be lucky too

250
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,920
by making me your father-in-law.

251
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:50,480
All right?

252
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:53,079
Auntie Erb.

253
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,079
It's such a good show.

254
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,890
My father loved...

255
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:03,960
This is so sour.

256
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,650
My father loved your cooking,

257
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,680
so he bought you
a fish and other stuff.

258
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,799
You can cook something for yourself.

259
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,079
Thank you.

260
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,759
Jai, he bought it for you too.

261
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:21,599
Thank you.

262
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,200
Thank you.

263
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,720
Unbelievable.

264
00:18:28,119 --> 00:18:29,920
She's only a tenant

265
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,920
but is using us to do stuff for her.

266
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,119
How shameless.

267
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,079
How is she shameless?

268
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,240
She is Madame's daughter-in-law.

269
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:39,759
We serve both Madame and Ms. Pa.

270
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:40,839
No.

271
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,039
Madame's the one
who pays our salary.

272
00:18:44,119 --> 00:18:48,759
If anyone wishes to quit
and go work for Ms. Pa,

273
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,650
I will tell Madame for you.

274
00:18:51,119 --> 00:18:52,839
That's a good idea.

275
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,240
I hope they all quit.

276
00:18:54,359 --> 00:18:56,039
That way, we will get a raise.

277
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,200
Wait.

278
00:18:58,279 --> 00:19:01,170
Madame wouldn't give you a raise

279
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,279
even if you two were
the only maids left in the house.

280
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,650
- Are you calling Madame cheap?
- Yes.

281
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:09,039
You two are extremely lazy.
That's what I'm trying to say.

282
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:10,359
I don't care.

283
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,720
I'm going to tell Madame.
I could use some money right now.

284
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,839
- Let's go.
- Yes.

285
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,079
I'm going to tell her.

286
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:19,079
Hey, do you think
they are really going to tell her?

287
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:21,960
I'll teach them a lesson.

288
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,200
Hey.

289
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,720
- Don't give me trouble. Come back.
- My goodness.

290
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,359
Sompit.

291
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,240
You are not going anywhere.

292
00:19:30,319 --> 00:19:31,720
Don't touch me.

293
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,079
What was that sound?

294
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:49,119
It's your new vase.

295
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,000
Who broke it?

296
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,079
Her.

297
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,039
But Sompit pushed me.

298
00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:01,000
Well, she tried to stop me

299
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:04,119
from telling you that she would
prefer to serve Ms. Pa.

300
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,359
She also called you cheap.

301
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,079
- It's not true, Madame.
- It's true.

302
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:09,200
Auntie Erb.

303
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,650
She was there.

304
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,920
Tell Madame what you heard.

305
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,039
Auntie Erb, is it true?

306
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,759
Auntie Erb, say it.

307
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:23,480
By staying quiet, it means
you prefer to serve Ms. Pa too.

308
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,119
No, I don't.

309
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:28,440
See? She agrees with us.

310
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:29,839
Tom.

311
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,119
Yes.

312
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,359
Keep deducting
30 percent from Jai's pay...

313
00:20:35,079 --> 00:20:36,960
until the vase is paid for.

314
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,200
How much was the vase?

315
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:40,960
It was 700,000 baht.

316
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,960
Did you say 700,000 baht?

317
00:20:45,519 --> 00:20:47,359
The vase was 700,000 baht.

318
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:49,890
My life is over.

319
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,599
The vase was 700,000 baht.

320
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:01,519
- It's 700,000 baht.
- It's okay.

321
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:05,200
- It's okay.
- How am I supposed to pay for it?

322
00:21:05,319 --> 00:21:07,960
What's wrong, Jai?
Why are you crying?

323
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:10,839
Ms. Pa, take a seat.

324
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,359
Jai was treated unfairly by Madame.

325
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,680
What happened?

326
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,650
Do you want me to talk to Madame?

327
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,650
No, it's all right.

328
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,920
It will only upset her even more.
She'll punish me even more for it.

329
00:21:30,839 --> 00:21:32,410
It's okay, Jai.

330
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:35,599
Can you tell me what happened?

331
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,759
I will get you justice.

332
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,279
All right?

333
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:44,170
Tell her.

334
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,000
- Tell her.
- Yes.

335
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,960
It's you, Sompit.

336
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:49,359
Is my mother still up?

337
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,960
Yes, I think she's in her room.

338
00:21:56,359 --> 00:21:57,359
Mom.

339
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,279
Mom.

340
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,200
Mom.

341
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,079
I want to talk about tomorrow.

342
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,839
What took you so long
to answer my call?

343
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,319
I have a job for you.

344
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,519
I need you

345
00:22:34,599 --> 00:22:37,160
to teach my daughter-in-law
a lesson.

346
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:59,920
Sathu.

347
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,599
Sit down, Pa.

348
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,240
What is that?

349
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:07,279
Keep this on you.

350
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:10,039
I hear your job with
Madame Nuan starts tomorrow.

351
00:23:10,119 --> 00:23:11,279
Keep it on you.

352
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:12,759
What?

353
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,599
What is this, Dad?

354
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:23,079
It will ward off any evil
that comes your way tomorrow.

355
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,559
Dad, are you jinxing me?

356
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,359
I'm not. It's sacred.

357
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,079
Sathu.

358
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:36,359
You can't let Pa
go with your mother then.

359
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,680
Do you think I can stop them?

360
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,359
But Madame is planning
to do something to Pa.

361
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,079
My mother isn't that cruel
of a person to kill anyone.

362
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,519
I'm going to let them work together

363
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:49,519
as I'm also curious

364
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:51,359
what my mother is up to.

365
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:11,000
Why did you pick me
to be the observer?

366
00:24:11,559 --> 00:24:12,880
Someone like you

367
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:15,839
must have a hidden intention.

368
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:17,759
Why did you agree to do it

369
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,559
if you don't trust me?

370
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,279
I only agreed

371
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,759
because my beloved husband

372
00:24:24,319 --> 00:24:26,400
begged me to take the job.

373
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,920
My beloved son

374
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,839
begged me as well.

375
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,519
He wants us

376
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:36,640
to get to know each other better.

377
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:40,160
I actually want to know

378
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,200
what my son sees in you.

379
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,359
You managed to land your own
brother-in-law in such a short time.

380
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:49,400
And I want to know

381
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,880
how you manage

382
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,440
to hide your true colors

383
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,519
from the world.

384
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,119
Listen, Ms. Pa.

385
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,480
I think we should go
before the traffic gets worse.

386
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,720
After you.

387
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:25,079
Please scoot to the inner seat.

388
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,359
I'll sit in the back.

389
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,319
This way, you won't get carsick.

390
00:25:52,119 --> 00:25:53,440
You can go.

391
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,359
Joy.

392
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,079
Where are you now?

393
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,519
What? You're not here yet?

394
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,920
What do I do...

395
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I have to go.

396
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,519
Hey.

397
00:26:14,759 --> 00:26:15,839
Yes, sir.

398
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,440
Are you going somewhere?

399
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,599
I have errands to run.
I'll see you later.

400
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:20,880
Hey, wait.

401
00:26:24,839 --> 00:26:26,319
No, I can't climb down.

402
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:37,279
Stop.

403
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,160
Where are you going?

404
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,359
What's wrong, Father?

405
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,160
Are you following Pa
and your mother?

406
00:26:43,319 --> 00:26:45,240
- Are you?
- Yes.

407
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,440
I'm coming with you.

408
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,759
Unlock the door. Hurry.

409
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,519
Like father, like daughter.

410
00:26:58,599 --> 00:26:59,720
What did you say?

411
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:01,559
Go after them.

412
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:23,839
(Enter Passcode)

413
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:26,240
...0423.

414
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,160
Madame.

415
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:43,640
We are visiting Madame Sopa
at the hospital first.

416
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,119
What's wrong with her this time?

417
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,839
She's got a herniated disc.

418
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,319
Hello, who is this?

419
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,119
It's me.

420
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,279
Thom?

421
00:28:03,359 --> 00:28:05,759
I'm just calling to tell you

422
00:28:05,839 --> 00:28:08,880
that I won't tell anyone
what you told me.

423
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,880
I promise to keep it a secret.

424
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,640
I wasn't worried at all.

425
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:20,119
Save your acting
for your father and other people.

426
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,599
Don't use it on me.

427
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,240
It will be less tiring for you.

428
00:28:23,319 --> 00:28:26,680
- Hey.
- If you wish to be with Nai

429
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:29,160
because you truly love him,

430
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,920
then I'll be happy to help you.

431
00:28:31,359 --> 00:28:34,720
But if you are doing this
solely for your father,

432
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:36,160
then I don't think you should.

433
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,960
How about this? Ask yourself first,

434
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:42,440
what you want to do.
Then you can tell me later.

435
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,839
Okay? I'm hanging up now. Bye.

436
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:48,359
Wait, Thom. Thom.

437
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:50,119
What?

438
00:28:51,319 --> 00:28:52,960
That wasn't even a conversation.

439
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,960
Thank you.

440
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:21,880
Ms. Pa, you can wait here.

441
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,039
That's all right.
I think I should go with Madame

442
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:28,480
to observe every part of her life.

443
00:29:38,599 --> 00:29:39,759
Where are you going?

444
00:29:40,319 --> 00:29:41,799
I'm going after Pa.

445
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,200
Your mother might be planning to
murder my daughter at the hospital.

446
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:46,880
Don't go.

447
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,480
Tom told me my mother would be
visiting her friend here.

448
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,599
Let's find somewhere
to wait for them.

449
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,279
Madame.

450
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,559
What now, Tom?

451
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:04,559
You are wasting my time.

452
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,559
I should be teaching her a lesson.

453
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,039
Be patient, Madame.

454
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:11,240
Don't blow your cover.

455
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:14,839
Ms. Pa is observing
your daily life right now.

456
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,880
Your revenge can wait.

457
00:30:18,839 --> 00:30:20,559
What were you going to say?

458
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,640
Well.

459
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,599
Madame Sopa's assistant
just informed me

460
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,680
that Madame Sopa's in the middle
of a physical therapy session.

461
00:30:27,759 --> 00:30:30,680
She can't see you right now.
She needs 15 more minutes.

462
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:32,720
Gosh, I'm not going to
wait that long.

463
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:33,880
Which floor is she on?

464
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,960
Second floor.

465
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,759
Wait, Madame.

466
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,319
Good morning.

467
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,480
Oh my gosh.

468
00:30:48,839 --> 00:30:50,359
Madame.

469
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,240
Hey.

470
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,079
You haven't told me
why you are doing this.

471
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,599
Doing what?

472
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,000
Following your mother
and my daughter around.

473
00:31:14,759 --> 00:31:19,079
Don't tell me you know
what your mother is up to.

474
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,240
I'm following them
because I'm worried

475
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,880
that they might not get along.

476
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,599
Let's find somewhere to sit.

477
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,799
You are not well.

478
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:34,240
Pa will be furious with me
if she finds out

479
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,799
I'm making you
stand around in the sun.

480
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:39,200
Da once told me
that you love massages.

481
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,680
Let's get a relaxing massage
to cool down while we wait.

482
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,160
- Hello.
- Hello.

483
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,839
What type of massage would you like?

484
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:59,119
Please give my father-in-law

485
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,079
the most relaxing
massage you've got.

486
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,279
You got it.
Is it for the both of you?

487
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,960
Just my father-in-law.

488
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,160
Aren't you getting one too?

489
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,680
No, I'm not.

490
00:32:10,079 --> 00:32:11,480
But don't worry.

491
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,119
I'll keep an eye on them.

492
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:15,480
The moment I see them
leaving the hospital,

493
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,559
I'll come get you.

494
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:20,319
Please take care of him.

495
00:32:20,519 --> 00:32:22,920
I will. Please follow me inside.

496
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,839
Welcome.

497
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,519
This way please.

498
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,960
Something doesn't feel right.

499
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,359
Come this way please.

500
00:32:45,599 --> 00:32:47,480
Would you like anything else?

501
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,799
We have many options
for you to choose from.

502
00:32:50,359 --> 00:32:51,359
I don't know.

503
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:56,079
I haven't been to this type
of massage parlor before.

504
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,160
Surprise me then.

505
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,920
I will give you
an unforgettable experience.

506
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:03,200
Please wait a moment.

507
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,279
Okay.

508
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,680
I'm back.

509
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,880
This is Khanomping,
and this is Alua.

510
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,440
Oh my.

511
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,000
Mister.

512
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:30,440
Are you sure you don't want
to use our service?

513
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,880
Feel free to look through
our catalog first.

514
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:39,960
I'm sorry to ask you this.

515
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,200
But is this place

516
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,240
not a traditional massage parlor?

517
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,799
We do offer traditional massages.

518
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:51,960
But most of the time,
people come here for something else.

519
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,319
I see.

520
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:03,319
Father?

521
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,400
Father?

522
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,239
This tiny house is so cozy.

523
00:34:17,329 --> 00:34:19,159
Everything is in the way I want it.

524
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,360
The blue wall is beautiful.

525
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,639
The windows, the doors,
and the curtains look very fancy.

526
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,679
I get to peek at you

527
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:29,119
- through the curtains.
- This is surely relaxing.

528
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,809
This tiny house is darn cozy.

529
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,199
I've been looking at you through
the window all morning.

530
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,239
This is entertaining.

531
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,329
- Are you enjoying it?
- Every second of it.

532
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,000
Da?

533
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:57,400
Oh my gosh.

534
00:34:57,809 --> 00:34:59,599
Pa? What are you doing here?

535
00:34:59,679 --> 00:35:01,239
Oh no.

536
00:35:01,329 --> 00:35:03,679
- Get up.
- Keep singing.

537
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:05,119
Isn't it your favorite song?

538
00:35:06,329 --> 00:35:08,199
- Sing.
- Sing.

539
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,039
I'm done.

540
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:12,159
I'm out of here.

541
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:14,000
Where are you going?

542
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,920
My children are haunting me

543
00:35:22,199 --> 00:35:23,809
for trying to hit on young girls.

544
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,480
Oh my.

545
00:35:26,329 --> 00:35:29,400
Are you sure? It's really relaxing.

546
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:31,960
I don't want to.

547
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:34,400
I'm married with a kid.

548
00:35:34,519 --> 00:35:37,199
Your wife is not going to find out.

549
00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:45,809
I'm a bad liar.

550
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,679
My wife would catch me
if I did anything bad.

551
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,960
Please tell my father-in-law
that I'll be in the car.

552
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,239
Excuse me.

553
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,880
Good. A true man
must not cave easily.

554
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:14,199
- I'm leaving right now.
- Yes, Madame.

555
00:36:21,289 --> 00:36:22,840
Madame.

556
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:26,289
Since it's noon,
we should grab some lunch.

557
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,239
The restaurant next door
sells clean food.

558
00:36:28,329 --> 00:36:31,000
I'll call Phol to pick you up.

559
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,199
That's all right. I'll walk there.

560
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:34,719
That way,

561
00:36:34,809 --> 00:36:37,159
I get to exercise
and save time and fuel

562
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:38,599
All right then.

563
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,079
Hey.

564
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,000
You...

565
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:54,679
Madame, the restaurant
is on the other side.

566
00:36:54,769 --> 00:36:55,880
Let's cross the road.

567
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,679
Ms. Pa!

568
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:35,559
Pa!

569
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:45,599
Why did you do that?

570
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:46,769
- Get off me.
- Stay still.

571
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,239
Pa.

572
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,289
How did you get here?

573
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,480
I...

574
00:37:53,559 --> 00:37:55,840
Dad, call the police now.

575
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,639
You.

576
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,400
Pa.

577
00:38:04,769 --> 00:38:05,960
You.

578
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:07,480
How dare you hurt my daughter!

579
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:10,199
Who are you? Let me take
a photo of your face.

580
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,480
Do you want more of that?

581
00:38:15,559 --> 00:38:17,119
Tom, call the police.

582
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,480
Yes.

583
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:50,480
I'll need you to come to the station
to give your statement.

584
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:51,639
- Yes.
- Yes.

585
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:53,599
- Please excuse me.
- Thank you.

586
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,239
Let's go, Pa.

587
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,960
Nai, let's wait for my father first.
He's getting my stuff.

588
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:05,440
Nai.

589
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,519
I'm going to go.
I have a busy schedule.

590
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:09,599
Yes, Mom.

591
00:39:09,719 --> 00:39:11,000
I'll take Pa to the station.

592
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,000
Here.

593
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:28,239
I got your stuff back.

594
00:39:28,679 --> 00:39:31,679
Luckily I gave you the amulet,
or you'd be in worse shape.

595
00:39:32,559 --> 00:39:33,769
Gosh, Dad.

596
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:36,159
- Thank you anyway.
- Sure.

597
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,440
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

598
00:39:42,639 --> 00:39:45,679
Are you sure those thieves
won't mention your name?

599
00:39:46,769 --> 00:39:48,840
Don't worry about it, Tom.

600
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:50,289
It's a shame

601
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:52,769
we couldn't get Ms. Pa's phone
as we had planned.

602
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,159
What are you doing here?

603
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:00,199
Enough with your questions.
Open the door.

604
00:40:00,289 --> 00:40:01,440
Open the door.

605
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,960
Tom.

606
00:40:12,639 --> 00:40:13,639
It's her phone.

607
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,960
Madame, would you like
some orange juice?

608
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:29,039
Don't let anyone inside
without my permission.

609
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,599
- Yes, Madame.
- Yes, Madame.

610
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,119
How does it feel
to get some fresh air?

611
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:51,400
The air is always fresh

612
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:53,769
whenever you're around.

613
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,960
Gosh, Trai.

614
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,719
Nade.

615
00:41:12,559 --> 00:41:13,559
Yes?

616
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:15,880
What are you doing?

617
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:21,920
I'm taking Trai out
for some fresh air, Mom.

618
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:28,679
You gave me your permission

619
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:31,480
to let my hero, Trai,
stay in our guest room

620
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,559
until he recovers.

621
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,079
Do you not remember?

622
00:41:37,639 --> 00:41:39,809
Go back to where you belong.

623
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,360
As for you, Nade,

624
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,079
once I'm done with everything,

625
00:41:44,159 --> 00:41:45,239
we need to talk.

626
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:55,119
- Get out of my way, Tom.
- Yes.

627
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:15,329
- Tom.
- Yes.

628
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,480
Give me Pa's passcode.

629
00:42:17,559 --> 00:42:21,000
It's 200423.

630
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,679
I'm in.

631
00:42:26,199 --> 00:42:27,840
Have you found anything?

632
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,769
Not yet.

633
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:33,039
But I know I will.

634
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:37,480
What are we looking for?

635
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,559
What secret are we trying to dig up?

636
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:53,199
What are you up to?

637
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,289
I'm working.

638
00:42:58,769 --> 00:43:00,440
How is it going with Madame Nuan?

639
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:02,960
It's going well.

640
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,400
I have some questions
regarding that matter.

641
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:10,880
What matter?

642
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:15,289
The incident that happened
while I was a student.

643
00:43:15,769 --> 00:43:18,809
Oh, that matter.

644
00:43:19,809 --> 00:43:21,360
Checkmate, Pa.

645
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,360
Don't call me.
I can't pick up right now.

646
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:49,119
Okay, what questions
do you have for me?

647
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,639
Dad, wait.

648
00:44:00,519 --> 00:44:02,079
My phone is missing.

649
00:44:02,159 --> 00:44:03,639
Did you pick it up for me?

650
00:44:04,719 --> 00:44:05,840
I'm not sure.

651
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:08,920
I grabbed everything
that was on the floor though.

652
00:44:21,679 --> 00:44:23,639
No one's answering.

653
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:25,800
Seriously?

654
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:27,840
Maybe you dropped it nearby.

655
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,159
Should we go take a look?

656
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,280
Wait, Nai.

657
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,800
Can I borrow your phone?

658
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:37,039
My phone is set up
so that your phone can find it.

659
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,360
We don't have to go back there.

660
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,360
Thank you.

661
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,840
Hey.

662
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:51,159
Why don't we sit over there?
Come on.

663
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,880
Let's go.
Do you want something to eat?

664
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:55,760
No, thanks.

665
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,559
No, thank you.

666
00:44:58,039 --> 00:45:00,320
One cream soda please.

667
00:45:07,840 --> 00:45:10,079
I would like some advice from you

668
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:12,960
on how to forget

669
00:45:13,199 --> 00:45:14,920
the incident.

670
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,400
You have to forgive yourself.

671
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:22,679
Forgive myself for what?

672
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,920
Hold on.

673
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,639
Nai, why was
my phone signal detected

674
00:45:30,679 --> 00:45:31,960
near your house?

675
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,800
Could you have dropped it
in my mother's car?

676
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:39,559
Let's do this.
I'll call my mother for you.

677
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:41,960
Okay.

678
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:48,679
- Yes?
- Check your bag again.

679
00:45:49,519 --> 00:45:53,760
Dad, the signal was detected
near Nai's house. It can't be here.

680
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:55,519
- What's the harm in making sure?
- See?

681
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,119
Take a look for yourself.

682
00:46:03,199 --> 00:46:04,199
It's Thom.

683
00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:06,199
What is it, Thom?

684
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,719
(Nai)

685
00:46:11,559 --> 00:46:14,039
Hello, Nai.

686
00:46:14,239 --> 00:46:15,719
Are you home, Mom?

687
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,320
Yes.

688
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:19,920
How do you know?

689
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,079
Pa's phone is missing.

690
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:25,280
Someone's using
your phone to text me.

691
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,280
And this person is asking

692
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,360
about the incident.

693
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:31,199
The incident?

694
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,480
Are you talking about...

695
00:46:34,119 --> 00:46:38,920
The night you drove...

696
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,519
Dad, I'll be right back.

697
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:43,599
Hold on.

698
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:47,760
Who is it, Thom?

699
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,719
How does this person know?

700
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,440
This person doesn't know

701
00:46:51,519 --> 00:46:53,920
what happened, but this person
definitely knows you have a secret.

702
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,760
This person is trying to trick me
into revealing your secret.

703
00:46:56,840 --> 00:47:00,079
But I know you would
never text me about it.

704
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:02,440
That's why I am certain
it wasn't you.

705
00:47:02,639 --> 00:47:06,199
Did you tell anyone else about it?

706
00:47:06,559 --> 00:47:07,920
No.

707
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,400
Only you and Nai know about it.

708
00:47:13,519 --> 00:47:16,239
Nai, why was
my phone signal detected

709
00:47:17,519 --> 00:47:18,880
near your house?

710
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:21,960
The only person I'll give permission
to follow me around

711
00:47:22,519 --> 00:47:24,519
is my daughter-in-law.

712
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:27,360
It's obvious
what she's planning to do.

713
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,559
It's Madame Nuan.

714
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,320
Pa...

715
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:33,960
What are you doing?

716
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
Nai?

717
00:47:39,639 --> 00:47:40,719
Nai?

718
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:44,079
My mother took your phone?

719
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:45,559
Yes.

720
00:47:45,719 --> 00:47:48,800
My father and I are going
to catch her red-handed.

721
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,559
I'll keep your phone with me for now

722
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:53,559
so you can't call your mother.

723
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:55,039
Wait, Pa.

724
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,679
Calm down.

725
00:47:56,880 --> 00:47:58,480
You might be wrong about this.

726
00:47:58,679 --> 00:48:01,920
Are you going to give me custody
of Nick if I'm right about this?

727
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:07,280
Don't stop me unless you can
answer me confidently.

728
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,199
No, I won't let you go alone.

729
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,760
I'm coming with you.

730
00:48:15,079 --> 00:48:17,199
I told you not to stop me.

731
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,000
It's not easy to attack me
on my weak spot.

732
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,320
It's not difficult either.

733
00:48:30,119 --> 00:48:32,159
I suggest you use this time
to prepare the divorce papers.

734
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:35,159
Today, I'm going to prove
to you that I'm right.

735
00:48:35,239 --> 00:48:38,679
Your mother is capable of doing
anything to get what she wants.

736
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,599
- Pa!
- Dad.

737
00:48:41,679 --> 00:48:42,719
Pa.

738
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:48,800
Take this one. This one is faster.

739
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,559
Listen, if you can get me home
within ten minutes,

740
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:53,760
I'll give you 1,000 baht each

741
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,760
- You got it.
- plus the fare.

742
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:55,800
Here, Dad.

743
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:59,360
- What happened to you?
- Let's go.

744
00:49:01,199 --> 00:49:02,239
Let's go.

745
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,719
Pa.

746
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:05,559
Drive carefully.

747
00:49:05,639 --> 00:49:08,079
If anything happens to her,
I'm going to kill you.

748
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,000
I have a job for you.

749
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:15,719
I need you

750
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,360
to teach my daughter-in-law
a lesson.

751
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,920
I'm sorry

752
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,480
for being the reason
you have to move back to your room.

753
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,840
It's a good idea
for me to move back.

754
00:49:40,199 --> 00:49:41,920
Sleeping on a fancy bed

755
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,199
is relaxing but worrisome.

756
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,639
I'm always paranoid that I might be
drooling or wetting the bed.

757
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,639
Thank you.

758
00:50:03,559 --> 00:50:07,199
Thank you for trying
to make me feel better.

759
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,599
I'm not trying to make you
feel better. It's the truth.

760
00:50:12,199 --> 00:50:13,760
Stop lying.

761
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,079
You always mean me well.

762
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,760
I need to do something nice
for you in return.

763
00:50:24,239 --> 00:50:28,559
How about this? I'm going to talk
my mother into letting you stay.

764
00:50:29,199 --> 00:50:30,480
Don't do that, Ms. Nade.

765
00:50:46,599 --> 00:50:48,000
Don't do that.

766
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:51,559
If Madame gets upset,
we will all be in trouble.

767
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:53,840
I'm all better now.

768
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,400
I can even dance for you.

769
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,440
My right leg was injured, right?
Look, I can dance.

770
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:03,480
You're so cute.
I don't buy it though.

771
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:04,880
Ms. Nade!

772
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,360
Don't do it, Ms. Nade!

773
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:08,119
Ms. Nade!

774
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,199
Ms. Nade, no!

775
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:14,639
Ms. Nade, don't do it. I'm fine now.

776
00:51:15,199 --> 00:51:16,280
Darn it.

777
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,800
Hello, Madame Nuan's residence.

778
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,079
Trai, it's me.

779
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:26,000
Nai, why are you calling
the landline?

780
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,400
Pa took my phone.

781
00:51:27,679 --> 00:51:29,760
I can't remember anyone's number
except for the landline.

782
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,920
I'm using an officer's phone
to call you.

783
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,079
An officer?

784
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:35,159
Is everything all right?

785
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:36,760
I'll tell you about it later.

786
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,199
Right now, I need your help.

787
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,679
I want to find out
if my mother has Pa's phone.

788
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,639
Mom.

789
00:51:49,559 --> 00:51:51,039
Mom.

790
00:51:53,159 --> 00:51:54,480
Ms. Nade.

791
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:56,320
Didn't your mother tell you

792
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:58,480
not to bother her since she's busy
with something important?

793
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,360
But I need to talk to her
about something even more important.

794
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:05,320
No, you can't go inside.

795
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,199
What was all that noise?

796
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,639
I told you I was busy.

797
00:52:32,239 --> 00:52:34,760
Busy with what?
You are not doing anything.

798
00:53:01,039 --> 00:53:03,119
Whose phone is this?

799
00:53:16,639 --> 00:53:18,079
What do I do?

800
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,480
I came to check on you.

801
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,000
My mother has agreed
to let you stay.

802
00:53:40,679 --> 00:53:45,440
I caught her going through
Pawinee's phone,

803
00:53:45,519 --> 00:53:47,800
so I used it as leverage.

804
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:50,880
That was unbelievably easy.

805
00:53:52,599 --> 00:53:53,679
Yes.

806
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:56,159
It was.

807
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:00,239
Luck

808
00:54:01,559 --> 00:54:03,719
is on our side, Trai.

809
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:10,800
That's all I came to say.

810
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,239
I'm going to help my mother
snoop through Pa's phone.

811
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,519
Okay.

812
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:24,239
Thank you for your help, Trai.

813
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,199
Should I warn Madame Nuan

814
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:27,760
that Pa is on her way here?

815
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,320
No.

816
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,000
My mother crossed the line
this time.

817
00:54:31,519 --> 00:54:33,599
I need to play fairly.

818
00:54:34,039 --> 00:54:36,320
I have to go.
I need to take care of something.

819
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:43,920
- Trai, I need your help.
- Yes.

820
00:54:44,559 --> 00:54:46,039
- With what, Uncle?
- Just follow me.

821
00:54:57,239 --> 00:54:59,920
Thank you.
Give me a minute with him.

822
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,000
All right.

823
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:09,519
What now? I've already confessed.

824
00:55:09,719 --> 00:55:12,800
I stole that lady's purse
because I needed money.

825
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:15,960
Your wife was just
an unlucky victim.

826
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:18,480
Hang in there for a while longer.

827
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,840
Madame Nuan is coming
to bail you out.

828
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,480
Thom, I'm almost home.
You may begin.

829
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:30,960
Let's do this.

830
00:55:33,679 --> 00:55:35,920
You've already moved past it.

831
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:38,440
Why are you suddenly bringing it up?

832
00:55:39,199 --> 00:55:40,320
Say she had a nightmare.

833
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,519
That's a bad reason.

834
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:47,159
Say

835
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:49,280
she had her future read.

836
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,360
Her reason is just as bad.

837
00:55:54,719 --> 00:55:56,119
Enough, both of you.

838
00:55:56,719 --> 00:55:59,199
Are you looking at that thing again?

839
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,480
We no longer need to come up
with an answer. He gave it away.

840
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,760
What is that thing?

841
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,400
That thing?

842
00:56:11,039 --> 00:56:13,480
Put it away safely
once you are done.

843
00:56:13,559 --> 00:56:15,559
You will be in big trouble

844
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,800
if Madame finds it.

845
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,400
It's really suspicious, Mom.

846
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:26,119
If we figure out what that thing is,
we'll find out her secret.

847
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:33,159
That thing?

848
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:38,079
It must be in Nai's room.

849
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,679
Clear the way. Madame is coming.

850
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:51,679
Madame is going to Mr. Nai's house?

851
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:53,639
Why?

852
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,280
She never goes there.

853
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,320
Is everything all right, Tom?

854
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:07,159
Hello.

855
00:57:07,239 --> 00:57:13,159
Nick, let's go outside
and get some vitamin D.

856
00:57:13,239 --> 00:57:14,960
I'm not done feeding him yet.

857
00:57:15,079 --> 00:57:16,360
Let's go.

858
00:57:16,440 --> 00:57:17,679
One, two, three.

859
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,960
Come on.

860
00:57:19,039 --> 00:57:20,960
Hold on. Wait for me.

861
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,920
Where are you taking him?

862
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:34,280
Nade.

863
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:37,000
Stay on the lookout. Stay here.

864
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:38,920
Okay.

865
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:00,320
Ms. Pa.

866
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:04,239
- Jai.
- Yes.

867
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,880
- Have you seen Madame?
- Yes.

868
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:07,599
She was heading to Mr. Nai's house.

869
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:09,159
I see.

870
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:11,159
You got me here super fast.
This is yours.

871
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:12,239
Wait.

872
00:58:12,239 --> 00:58:13,639
- Yes?
- What about the fare?

873
00:58:13,719 --> 00:58:15,519
You said the fare wasn't included.

874
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:18,360
Oh, right. How much is the fare?

875
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,119
- It's 140 baht.
- 140 baht.

876
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:22,920
- I... Jai.
- Yes.

877
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,679
Can you pay the fare for me?
I'll pay you back later.

878
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,360
- Thank you.
- I...

879
00:58:28,519 --> 00:58:29,840
I'll...

880
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:34,159
Oh my... I have a thing
for men with squinty eyes.

881
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:35,920
- I'll go get the money then.
- Okay.

882
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:37,280
- Wait for me.
- Okay.

883
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:41,280
You should have waited
until I finished feeding him first.

884
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:43,719
You can feed him here
while he enjoys the fresh air.

885
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:47,039
- Isn't it delicious, handsome?
- Guys.

886
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:49,920
Does anyone have 140 baht?

887
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:51,880
I have to pay for Ms. Pa's fare.

888
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,559
- I do. Hold him.
- Great.

889
00:58:56,880 --> 00:58:59,000
- Whose fare is the money for again?
- Ms. Pa's.

890
00:58:59,079 --> 00:59:00,360
She probably had a stomachache.

891
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:02,239
She ran inside right away.

892
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:04,159
- Did you say Ms. Pa?
- Yes.

893
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:09,239
Wait, Tom.
You haven't given me the money...

894
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,360
Ms. Pa!

895
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:24,480
I'm sorry. I have trouble
controlling my voice when surprised.

896
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:26,199
You may not know this,

897
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:29,360
but I can be even louder
when I'm really surprised.

898
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,079
For instance, Ms. Pa!
Ms. Pa is back!

899
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,920
Take that as an example.

900
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:42,039
Nai's windows and door
are completely shut.

901
00:59:42,320 --> 00:59:43,880
You can scream
as loudly as you want,

902
00:59:44,159 --> 00:59:47,320
but no one inside that room
is going to hear you.

903
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:53,119
Shoot.

904
00:59:53,559 --> 00:59:54,599
What do I do?

905
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,559
I should call Madame.

906
00:59:58,039 --> 00:59:59,679
I forgot to bring my phone.

907
01:00:10,599 --> 01:00:12,039
- Mom!
- Be quiet.

908
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,079
- Stop.
- What's your problem?

909
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:16,280
- Come back.
- No!

910
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,559
What's your problem?

911
01:00:17,639 --> 01:00:19,519
Hey!

912
01:00:19,599 --> 01:00:20,920
No! Hey!

913
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,840
- Mom, Pa's back!
- Shut it.

914
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:28,519
Quiet.

915
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:30,480
Mom! No!

916
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:33,119
Is there a drama
where two men fall in love?

917
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:35,400
Move!

918
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,079
Tom!

919
01:00:37,159 --> 01:00:39,199
- What's going on?
- Let's find out.

920
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,360
Hey!

921
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,599
Tom, where are you? Tom!

922
01:00:44,679 --> 01:00:45,920
Come here.

923
01:00:46,039 --> 01:00:47,039
What do you want?

924
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:49,840
No!

925
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:59,440
Tom, wait.
Where are you taking the ladder?

926
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,679
Don't ask questions now.
Help me first.

927
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,079
- Okay.
- Come on.

928
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,199
It's heavy.

929
01:01:04,280 --> 01:01:06,480
- Pivot.
- Pivot.

930
01:01:06,599 --> 01:01:08,800
Mom!

931
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:10,320
You won't shut up, will you?

932
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:11,559
Mom...

933
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:15,159
Mom, Pa tied me up!

934
01:01:15,320 --> 01:01:16,440
Mom!

935
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,639
Be quiet!

936
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:30,519
Let me take a photo as proof
that you are an accomplice.

937
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:34,880
Stay here.

938
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:36,239
Hey, where are you going?

939
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:37,400
Come back.

940
01:01:48,679 --> 01:01:50,000
Pawinee's back.

941
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,119
Madame, I know you are in there.

942
01:02:03,880 --> 01:02:05,400
Open the door, Madame.

943
01:02:09,639 --> 01:02:11,000
Tom.

944
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:18,880
How did Pawinee get here?

945
01:02:18,960 --> 01:02:22,039
I don't know.
But you must leave now.

946
01:02:22,119 --> 01:02:23,360
Come with me.

947
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:34,039
Are you kidding me, Tom?

948
01:02:36,239 --> 01:02:37,239
Oh no.

949
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:38,679
You won't open the door, will you?

950
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:59,119
Where do you think you are going?

951
01:03:00,159 --> 01:03:01,679
Let's take you back.

952
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,280
Be careful.

953
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:13,800
Madame, climb down now. Come on.

954
01:03:14,239 --> 01:03:15,480
Climb down the ladder.

955
01:03:17,639 --> 01:03:19,199
I can't do it, Tom.

956
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,960
Fine.

957
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:41,079
Come on. Quickly.

958
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:42,920
I'm back. 140 baht, right?

959
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:44,320
- Yes.
- Here you go.

960
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:45,800
- Do you want my number too?
- No, thanks.

961
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,559
- No? It's 091-91256...
- No, I don't want it.

962
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,000
I don't mind giving it to you.

963
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:54,280
You look cute when you smile.

964
01:03:54,519 --> 01:03:55,559
Come again.

965
01:04:04,199 --> 01:04:06,599
- Here. Jai, pay the fare for me.
- Yes?

966
01:04:08,119 --> 01:04:09,760
What's with these two?

967
01:04:09,920 --> 01:04:11,119
I have to go get the money again.

968
01:04:11,199 --> 01:04:12,199
Wait... My goodness.

969
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:19,000
Did you see the biker
who drove past you just now?

970
01:04:19,559 --> 01:04:20,719
You look just like him.

971
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:22,480
Are you brothers?

972
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:23,559
No.

973
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:24,760
- No?
- No.

974
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:27,719
Can humans really
make copies of themselves?

975
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,719
- How much is the fare?
- It's 140 baht.

976
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:32,320
Let me go get you that 140 baht.

977
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,599
- Don't be scared. Hurry.
- Come down. Take another step.

978
01:04:38,719 --> 01:04:40,360
- Oh my gosh.
- Madame, hurry up.

979
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:42,719
Sompit, hold the ladder firmly.

980
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:44,000
I am.

981
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:46,599
- Come on down.
- Hold it firmly.

982
01:04:46,679 --> 01:04:47,880
Don't shake it.

983
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,239
- Come down.
- Hold it properly. It's shaking.

984
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:00,920
Did you think you could
get away with this, Thief?

985
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,960
- Phol.
- Yes.

986
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,280
- What's in the bag?
- A snake.

987
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,519
Is it a cobra?

988
01:05:11,599 --> 01:05:13,480
No, just a harmless snake.

989
01:05:14,960 --> 01:05:16,239
Give it to me.

990
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,400
- A harmless snake, you say?
- Yes.

991
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,519
Oh my.

992
01:05:20,599 --> 01:05:22,159
Be careful.

993
01:05:25,039 --> 01:05:26,280
- You...
- Sir.

994
01:05:28,239 --> 01:05:29,440
Hey.

995
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:31,320
I have a gift for you!

996
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:44,840
Oh my goodness.

997
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:48,519
A snake!

998
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:54,440
A snake!

999
01:05:57,320 --> 01:06:00,559
- Sompit, get it off me.
- I can't.

1000
01:06:00,639 --> 01:06:03,119
- Get it off me.
- I really can't.

1001
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:05,679
- How's that?
- Get it off.

1002
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,280
Get it off me.

1003
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:18,079
Put me down.

1004
01:06:18,639 --> 01:06:19,760
Dad?

1005
01:06:19,840 --> 01:06:20,960
Pa.

1006
01:06:21,039 --> 01:06:22,480
I've caught the thief.

1007
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:23,960
Hey.

1008
01:06:24,039 --> 01:06:27,000
Put me down. Put me down now.

1009
01:06:27,119 --> 01:06:28,119
You've got quite the strength.

1010
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,320
- Phol, get it off me.
- Come here.

1011
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:32,480
Hold this.

1012
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:34,320
Phol.

1013
01:06:36,840 --> 01:06:38,400
- Open the bag.
- Hold on.

1014
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:40,119
I'll set you free.

1015
01:06:40,280 --> 01:06:44,400
- Go in the bag. I'm sorry.
- Go in there.

1016
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:46,480
- Okay.
- Close the bag.

1017
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:47,760
See you later.

1018
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,639
Who did you call a thief?

1019
01:06:56,280 --> 01:07:00,400
There's proof. Are you going to keep
lying that you didn't steal it?

1020
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:02,559
Don't play dumb.

1021
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:04,519
Give me back Pa's phone.

1022
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:06,159
Look at you.

1023
01:07:06,719 --> 01:07:08,679
- I'll get it myself then.
- Stop.

1024
01:07:08,760 --> 01:07:09,880
Don't touch me.

1025
01:07:20,239 --> 01:07:22,840
You got caught red-handed.
I'm going to punish you.

1026
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,440
- No.
- Come here.

1027
01:07:24,519 --> 01:07:25,760
Don't follow me.

1028
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,679
- Put me down.
- Don't follow me.

1029
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:29,280
- Put me down.
- Don't you dare.

1030
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:30,840
- You, jerk.
- Or you'll become her accomplice.

1031
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:33,239
- You, jerk. Put me down.
- Come with me, Madame.

1032
01:07:38,920 --> 01:07:40,880
Put me down. What did I do?

1033
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,280
- A horrible person like you
- Put me down.

1034
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:45,519
- needs to wash away your sins.
- Look.

1035
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:47,639
- Get in there.
- No.

1036
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:50,719
How does it feel, Madame?

1037
01:07:50,880 --> 01:07:52,760
Do you need shampoo and soap

1038
01:07:52,880 --> 01:07:55,320
to wash away your sins?

1039
01:07:55,400 --> 01:07:56,760
You, jerk!

1040
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,760
He just threw her

1041
01:07:58,840 --> 01:08:00,119
in the pool.

1042
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,519
Madame.

1043
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:07,559
Dao, why did you bring Nick here?

1044
01:08:09,079 --> 01:08:11,159
- Madame.
- Madame.

1045
01:08:11,239 --> 01:08:12,480
Pa, come here.

1046
01:08:13,360 --> 01:08:14,480
I'll be right back.

1047
01:08:16,609 --> 01:08:17,960
Take your phone back.

1048
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:22,800
Wait. We need to talk.

1049
01:08:23,359 --> 01:08:24,479
Let me ask you something.

1050
01:08:24,720 --> 01:08:27,720
What were you trying
to do with Pa's phone?

1051
01:08:28,239 --> 01:08:31,279
I wanted to find out

1052
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:34,159
my daughter-in-law's
deep dark secrets.

1053
01:08:46,649 --> 01:08:48,239
They caused me anguish.

1054
01:08:48,439 --> 01:08:50,279
Madame Nuan threatened me.

1055
01:08:50,279 --> 01:08:51,800
If her secret can kill them,

1056
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:52,960
then I'm going to reveal it!

1057
01:08:53,039 --> 01:08:54,760
- What is it?
- Nai.

1058
01:08:54,840 --> 01:08:56,159
You and Lita...

1059
01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:58,479
Do you think we're secretly dating?

1060
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:00,529
This slap was for your boldness!

1061
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:02,439
Stop! I'm begging you!

1062
01:09:02,529 --> 01:09:03,880
Once Pa gets divorced,

1063
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,960
can I go all in
and make a move on her?

1064
01:09:07,039 --> 01:09:08,119
Divorce it is then.

1065
01:09:08,199 --> 01:09:09,680
You're still my wife.

1066
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:11,569
And I still have the right
to take care of you.

1067
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:13,000
Are you going to divorce him or not?

1068
01:09:13,079 --> 01:09:15,000
We don't need to lie
to your father anymore.

1069
01:09:15,000 --> 01:09:16,199
- Nit!
- Dad!

1070
01:09:16,199 --> 01:09:17,569
Nit! Nit!
