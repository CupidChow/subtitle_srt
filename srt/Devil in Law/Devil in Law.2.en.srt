1
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,840
Take Srikanda away.

2
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:37,479
Don't let her near my party.

3
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,400
Protect my baby...

4
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:40,840
I promise.

5
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,879
We are officially enemies,

6
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,240
Madame Nuan.

7
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,159
You recklessly let
your mother kill her.

8
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,199
When that time comes,

9
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,280
Nick will be pushed aside.

10
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,400
What must I do for you to trust me?

11
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,280
Marry me.

12
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,199
Pa and I are married.

13
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,120
I'm your new daughter-in-law.

14
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,560
If I manage to prove

15
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,719
that your mother is not
a good person like you think,

16
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,800
you must give me
full custody of Nick.

17
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,080
Those two

18
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,120
are hiding something from us.

19
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,599
Can you stop Nai from visiting me?

20
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,159
Why not?

21
00:03:11,919 --> 00:03:15,240
Nai actually said it himself
he wants to visit you here.

22
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,240
He wouldn't waste his time doing so
if you weren't important to him.

23
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,439
I'm embarrassed, Dad.

24
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,199
I don't want to be someone who hopes
to steal a married man like before.

25
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:30,280
But Madame Nuan only wants you
to be her daughter-in-law.

26
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:33,319
But Nai doesn't want that, Dad.

27
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,719
And now he's legally married
to Da's sister,

28
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:38,319
It's an obvious sign

29
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,840
that he's not interested.

30
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,319
If you want someone
to be there to help me,

31
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,680
can it be someone else instead?

32
00:03:58,719 --> 00:04:01,360
I thought we'd already come to
a mutual understanding about this.

33
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,120
About why that person has to be,
Noppanai, Madame Nuan's son only.

34
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,560
Why do you insist on being stubborn?

35
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,800
Why?

36
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,919
Dad, you're hurting me.

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,280
It's incomparable to
the pain you've caused me.

38
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,079
Remember.

39
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,399
I'm trying to help you.

40
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,610
So you have to help me too.

41
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:23,920
Seduce Madame Nuan's son
and make him your husband.

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,879
So both of us can finally be happy.

43
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:48,920
Mrs. Da probably told her sister
to claim her husband

44
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,399
before Ms. Lalita whisks her away.

45
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,800
Little did she know

46
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,730
there's no way anyone can

47
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:02,079
take Mr. Nai away
from Ms. Lita anymore.

48
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:05,120
- Why not?
- Because Madame has chosen

49
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,639
that her daughter-in-law

50
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:11,639
can only be
someone perfect like Ms. Lalita.

51
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,170
But Mr. Nai is legally married to
Mrs. Da's sister now.

52
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,279
If he can get married,
he can get a divorce as well.

53
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,920
- Who cares?
- Who cares?

54
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,360
You're still alive, aren't you?

55
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,519
You're still with me.

56
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:14,360
I've missed you

57
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,920
and our son.

58
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,040
Please take good care of him.

59
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,639
Come on, Nai.

60
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,879
You startled me.

61
00:08:23,959 --> 00:08:25,600
You crept up so quietly.

62
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,839
I should be the one who's shocked.

63
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,079
Why did you have
to sneak in this late?

64
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,879
And what were you doing in there?

65
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:35,330
I miss dear Auntie Erb, so I thought
I'd come and stay over.

66
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,759
I just jumped over the wall,

67
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,210
and my charger fell out

68
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,639
because my bag was open.

69
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:45,120
- I've been looking for it for ages.
- Okay, stop.

70
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:47,240
It's over there.

71
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,399
Oh?

72
00:08:50,679 --> 00:08:52,559
Seriously.

73
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,840
Don't you have to go
to work tomorrow?

74
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:06,399
I've been out of a job
for three months now.

75
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,639
You're out of a job?

76
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:11,360
I clashed with the top architect
in the company,

77
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,120
so I got fired.

78
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:15,279
I still can't find a new job,

79
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,240
and I don't have
any money to pay rent.

80
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,679
So I decided to come
and stay here for a while.

81
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,480
But do you mind

82
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,559
zipping up your mouth for a bit?
Don't tell anyone yet.

83
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,639
You can stay in my room tonight.

84
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,159
I sleep alone.

85
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,720
With pleasure, Nai.

86
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,210
Oh, that's right.

87
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,399
I haven't seen you
since Da's passing.

88
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,360
My condolences.

89
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:40,960
But trust me.

90
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:42,799
She's still right beside you

91
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,240
and always rooting for you.

92
00:09:46,279 --> 00:09:48,279
I believe she's still here as well.

93
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:55,240
What makes you think that?

94
00:09:57,919 --> 00:10:00,000
It's nothing. Let's head inside.

95
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,210
Come on.

96
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,279
Did he get spooked or something?

97
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,399
Ah, don't.

98
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,679
Don't you dare.

99
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:12,840
Nai.

100
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,360
Was that ticklish?

101
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Was that ticklish?

102
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,360
I'm going to eat your guts now.

103
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:24,720
I'll give Nick a bath
and get changed.

104
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,799
I'm going to eat your liver.

105
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,399
Was that ticklish?

106
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,450
Grandpa,

107
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,120
do you mind if I give Nick a bath?

108
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,360
We'll play together again, okay?

109
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,240
Come on now.

110
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:45,480
Let's go, go, go.

111
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,159
Dad,

112
00:10:54,450 --> 00:10:56,399
why are you looking at me like that?

113
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:11,000
You don't want me to go?

114
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,279
Can I even stop you from going?

115
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,200
If you ask me,

116
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:16,840
then I won't go.

117
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,759
I want you to be okay.

118
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,519
No.

119
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,519
I don't want to
force anyone anymore.

120
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,559
- Right.
- Hm?

121
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,960
But you have to promise me

122
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,799
if that family
causes you any anguish,

123
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:34,480
you have to hurry back to me.

124
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:38,279
And don't think I'm going
to scold you or rub it in

125
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,399
until you feel repressed
and die like your sister.

126
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,120
Okay, Dad. I promise.

127
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,600
Good.

128
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,240
And don't forget

129
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,480
I let you legally marry Nai

130
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,159
because you promised me

131
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,799
you wouldn't fall in love with him.

132
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:07,519
I won't be able to accept the fact
my two daughters share a husband.

133
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,879
Don't worry about that.

134
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:12,399
There's no way
I'm going to fall for him.

135
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:14,279
Seeing him

136
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:17,559
and being reminded of how Da had
to suffer while living there

137
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:19,159
makes me want to puke.

138
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,960
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

139
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,159
- Hey.
- Hm?

140
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,120
But Madame's son is quite handsome.

141
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,639
I wouldn't bat an eye even if he
were a million times more handsome.

142
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,960
You know

143
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,120
my heart

144
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:39,720
doesn't want to love anyone anymore.

145
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,799
Oh?

146
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,159
You still haven't
forgotten about him?

147
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,240
Oh.

148
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:11,799
(So happy)

149
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,720
I'm on my way.

150
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,240
Wow,

151
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,480
you definitely
are the hottest guy in school.

152
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,240
You got even more hearts
than last year's Valentine's.

153
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,399
Uh...

154
00:13:48,759 --> 00:13:50,000
Hasn't Uncle Nit arrived?

155
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,840
No, not yet.

156
00:13:52,799 --> 00:13:53,840
Is something the matter?

157
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,279
Thom.

158
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:12,399
I...

159
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,639
I'd like you to give this to Da.

160
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,399
Why don't you do it?
Da's inside the house.

161
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:25,279
Uh...

162
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,000
I'm too embarrassed.

163
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,559
Who's here, Pa?

164
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:30,759
Uh... Pa,

165
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:33,120
give this to Da, won't you?
I'm going now.

166
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,440
Oh?

167
00:14:37,799 --> 00:14:39,559
Hm?

168
00:14:45,679 --> 00:14:47,080
This one's for you.

169
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,399
Bye.

170
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:14,559
I'm almost there, Pa. Get ready.

171
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,759
Ma'am, are you okay? Ma'am?

172
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,720
Oh, Joy.

173
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:29,960
Thom.

174
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:31,799
Roll it down.

175
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,120
Joy, I'm sorry.
I wasn't paying attention.

176
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,320
Are you okay?

177
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,840
I'm fine.

178
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,240
Joy, let's pull over there and talk.

179
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,600
Sure, sure.

180
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:45,879
Joy.

181
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,519
Thank you.

182
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,440
Where were you just now?

183
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,320
I went to my old house.

184
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,480
Uh...

185
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:59,159
I just heard about Da.

186
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,799
So I thought
I should visit Uncle Nit.

187
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,120
You'll run into Pa
if you go there now though.

188
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,759
That's good. I want to see her too.

189
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,200
I don't think you should right now,

190
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,200
or she won't be able to cope.

191
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,440
Cope with what?

192
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,240
With Da, obviously.

193
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,240
You were her friend.

194
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,240
If Pa sees you,

195
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,840
she'll be reminded
even more of her sister.

196
00:16:21,799 --> 00:16:24,799
And how come you're alone?

197
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,840
Why didn't you bring
your wife along?

198
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:28,879
What? I don't have one.

199
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,159
Oh?

200
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,240
Well,

201
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:34,200
I used to think
about getting married.

202
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,960
But it's a big deal.

203
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:40,559
I thought a lot about it
and ended up not getting married.

204
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,200
If you're still single,

205
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,600
then you really
shouldn't be seeing Pa.

206
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:48,000
Let's visit Uncle Nit together
another time.

207
00:16:48,159 --> 00:16:49,679
I feel sorry for Pa.

208
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:51,559
Ever since Da's death,

209
00:16:51,679 --> 00:16:53,679
she's cried far too much.

210
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,519
You ran into Thom?

211
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,000
Ms. Pa, Ms. Joy,

212
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,559
Nick's asleep. Do you mind
keeping it down, please?

213
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,480
Oh, I'm sorry.

214
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:11,319
You're so noisy.

215
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:13,680
Didn't you scream just now as well?

216
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:17,240
By the way, I told him
not to come and see you.

217
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:18,480
You might get hopeful.

218
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:21,920
Isn't he married anyway?

219
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,559
Not yet.

220
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:25,410
Not yet?

221
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,839
That's right.

222
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,720
He admitted it himself
he's not married.

223
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,960
But you are.

224
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,960
Do you understand now

225
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,519
why I had to stop him
from seeing you?

226
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:40,480
Okay, I get it now.

227
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,960
That's good, actually.
So I'll be able to forget.

228
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,170
I can't fall for anyone for a while.

229
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:02,000
Here. Pa's number.

230
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Oh.

231
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,650
Thank you so much, Uncle.

232
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,650
Initially, I thought I was going
to visit you later.

233
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,200
But I came to see a friend.
He lives at the end of the street.

234
00:18:12,279 --> 00:18:14,079
So I thought I'd just
drop by anyway.

235
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:17,890
Call Pa sometimes.

236
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,920
She mentioned she misses you.

237
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
I will.

238
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:36,599
Good thing Pa's here to help
take care of Nick.

239
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,960
So Da can finally rest in peace.

240
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,650
Why do you think so?

241
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,890
Da once told me

242
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,440
that if anything happened to her,

243
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,440
she'd like Nick to be in Pa's care.

244
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,480
Why did you say that?

245
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,759
Oh, I suspect she said so

246
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:57,200
because she was worried
you might be working hard

247
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:59,279
and might not have time for Nick.

248
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,720
Yes, that's right.

249
00:19:05,359 --> 00:19:06,440
You and your big mouth.

250
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,039
Come on.

251
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,000
Let's go.

252
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,759
Oh? You're here too, Trai?

253
00:19:23,319 --> 00:19:25,680
Oh, I'm on leave from work.

254
00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:28,000
Pa, Joy, this is Trai and Jai.

255
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,680
- Hello.
- Hi.

256
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,170
Trai, Jai, this is Joy.
She's a friend of Pa's.

257
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,650
- Hi.
- Hi.

258
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,759
Should I bring the luggage
to the other house?

259
00:19:35,839 --> 00:19:37,039
Sure.

260
00:19:37,119 --> 00:19:38,170
After you, ma'am.

261
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:42,359
Wait.

262
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:49,839
You should get disinfected
before you come inside.

263
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,000
Turn around.

264
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,279
There are a lot of germs out there.

265
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,599
Pit, Tang, that's enough.

266
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,799
Nade, Nick could get sprayed.

267
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:09,680
People in this family

268
00:20:10,170 --> 00:20:11,650
seem to be clean freaks.

269
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,890
So how come
their hearts are so filthy?

270
00:20:15,079 --> 00:20:16,480
Oh, I forgot.

271
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:20,079
You can't clean
a filthy heart with alcohol.

272
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,359
You have to use morality.

273
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,170
But I guess people here
don't know what that is either.

274
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,200
Nade.

275
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,279
Pa, that's enough.

276
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,650
- Can you escort Pa to the house?
- Of course.

277
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,480
Let's go, Ms. Pa.

278
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,410
Nade, I'm begging you...

279
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,759
You should tell your new wife
to stay in line, Nai.

280
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,410
Then don't pick a fight with her.

281
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,440
I'm telling Mom you sided with her.

282
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:04,839
- Thanks, Trai.
- No worries.

283
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,680
- Jai.
- Yes?

284
00:21:06,759 --> 00:21:08,559
I can take them upstairs.

285
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:11,650
It's not a bother at all.
It's part of my job anyway.

286
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,960
- Thank you.
- Oh, you don't have to.

287
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,890
How many people
are there in this house?

288
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,519
Before it was just Da and Nick.

289
00:21:22,079 --> 00:21:23,720
Nai would be away at work

290
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:26,000
for months at a time.

291
00:21:26,079 --> 00:21:28,200
I guess she must have been lonely.

292
00:21:28,279 --> 00:21:29,680
Oh, I don't think so.

293
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,170
There's always something to have
a headache about here.

294
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:34,839
About what?

295
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,650
Joy, enough.

296
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,920
You'll find it out yourself
from Pa later.

297
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:45,410
Here you are, Nick.

298
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,759
Are you tired?

299
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,359
Pa,

300
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,759
can I have a word with you?

301
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,519
If you're going to stay here,

302
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,559
then you should ignore
what Nade said to you.

303
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:19,240
Instead of telling your sister off
for being rude,

304
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,720
you tell other people
to just ignore her?

305
00:22:22,279 --> 00:22:23,799
You're such a good brother.

306
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,480
I have my reasons.

307
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,200
And what are those?

308
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,240
Does Nade have a mental disorder

309
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,920
and the only way to stay alive
is to insult people?

310
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,799
Anyway, I'm begging you.

311
00:22:36,599 --> 00:22:37,920
Put in the effort.

312
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,720
I'll have to go back to work soon.

313
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:44,160
You'll manage, won't you?

314
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:45,799
For sure.

315
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:47,279
You go ahead.

316
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,839
You can go now, actually.
I hate your guts.

317
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:23,880
Pa's taking care of Nick
like you wanted now.

318
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,200
There's nothing for you
to worry about anymore, Da.

319
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:39,640
Nick.

320
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,240
Nick, Daddy has to go to work now.

321
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,880
Okay?

322
00:23:48,279 --> 00:23:49,359
Are you okay?

323
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:57,880
Daddy's going to work now.

324
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:02,160
- Here. I'll carry that.
- Okay.

325
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,160
You'll be gone for days.
Don't you want me to drive you?

326
00:24:06,599 --> 00:24:09,519
It's okay. It's more convenient
if I leave the car at the company.

327
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:12,680
Trai,

328
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:15,960
look after Pa and Nick for me, okay?

329
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,960
You can always call me
if there's anything.

330
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,599
Nai's gone.

331
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:31,720
Do you want to deal
with her now, Mom?

332
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,279
There's no use in prolonging it.

333
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,400
I'm here to introduce myself.

334
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,119
And I have some gifts
for everyone too.

335
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:47,759
Here you are.

336
00:24:47,839 --> 00:24:49,720
Hand cream.
It's for you, Auntie Erb.

337
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:52,599
Da told me your hands get dry
after spending time in the kitchen.

338
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:54,200
Here you are. Please use it.

339
00:24:54,279 --> 00:24:55,519
Thank you.

340
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,839
- You're welcome.
- The brand's name is in English.

341
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,559
And these are yours, Uncle Phol.

342
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,599
Sunglasses. You can wear them
while driving.

343
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,640
And there's also a nice hat.

344
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,160
- Thank you.
- You've got sunglasses.

345
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
You'll look cool in that.

346
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,079
See?

347
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,079
This one's yours, Jai.

348
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,240
A pheromone perfume.

349
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:18,359
The suitors will be lining up.
I guarantee it.

350
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,160
I love it. Thank you.

351
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,079
And this is yours, Dao.

352
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:28,839
Lotion with a hint of fragrance
so Nick won't be allergic to it.

353
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:32,119
Oh, thank you.

354
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,200
I don't have anything for you, Trai.

355
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:38,400
Because I didn't know you'd be here.

356
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,799
Oh, it's okay.

357
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:42,839
You can take mine.

358
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,039
There.

359
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:45,119
You look handsome in that.

360
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,839
- Trust me.
- Wear it.

361
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,519
- You should keep it.
- I want you to have it.

362
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:52,640
Uncle Phol.

363
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,880
Uncle Phol,

364
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:56,119
let's run some water on that.

365
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,160
- I'm so sorry.
- See?

366
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,559
I'm sorry.

367
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,640
It's hot.

368
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,079
Dao, I spotted some aloe vera

369
00:26:02,079 --> 00:26:03,640
- on the way here.
- Grab me some paper towels.

370
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,839
Can you get some?
I'll give him first aid.

371
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:06,880
Of course.

372
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:08,839
- That's enough now.
- Do you feel better?

373
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,160
It'll be okay.

374
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,839
Wipe it gently, Trai.

375
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,319
You're here.

376
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,920
Madame would like to see you now.

377
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,480
Is it urgent?

378
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,799
Urgent or not, you have to go now.

379
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,200
Tell her I need five minutes.
I have to give Uncle Phol first aid.

380
00:26:29,119 --> 00:26:31,839
- I'll rub aloe vera on the burn.
- Okay.

381
00:26:35,599 --> 00:26:37,440
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

382
00:26:37,599 --> 00:26:39,240
- Jai, can you get me a knife?
- Yes?

383
00:26:39,319 --> 00:26:41,359
- Oh, sure.
- It's so hot.

384
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,599
Thank you.

385
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,599
We have a rule here.

386
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:48,480
If Madame wants to see you,
you have to go there right away.

387
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,319
Ms. Pa, you should go.

388
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,039
I'll take it from you here.
Let's not make Madame angry.

389
00:26:55,079 --> 00:26:56,079
Yes, you should.

390
00:26:56,079 --> 00:26:57,599
What would she be angry about?

391
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:59,839
About you wasting her time.

392
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,279
I guess you're new here.

393
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:06,440
That's why you don't know
how much her time is worth.

394
00:27:06,519 --> 00:27:08,920
And is our time worthless?

395
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,559
Ms. Pa also said

396
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,160
not to use your position as the boss
to take advantage of other people.

397
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:28,200
Because every human
has equal rights.

398
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,400
And they should respect each other.

399
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,480
She probably wanted to show
the kitchen staff how tough she is.

400
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:35,920
Should I go there and drag her over?

401
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,519
No.

402
00:27:40,119 --> 00:27:42,079
If you don't go to see Madame now,

403
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,839
she's going to tell Nai.

404
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,359
Good.

405
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,400
So he'll know his family
is full of themselves...

406
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,720
Manipulative,

407
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:57,359
selfish,

408
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,160
and self-centered.

409
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,200
Ms. Pa's words, not mine.

410
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,480
How dare she?

411
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:14,200
Pit, go back and tell her...

412
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,440
If you don't go and see her now,

413
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:18,200
she's going to call the police
to arrest you

414
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,960
for slander.

415
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,119
Ms. Pa said

416
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,000
she's happy
for you to have her arrested

417
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,359
if you're happy for the public

418
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,559
to keep gossiping about your family.

419
00:28:31,759 --> 00:28:33,000
Pawinee.

420
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,599
She's not scared of Nai

421
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:36,240
or the police.

422
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,160
What should we use
to threaten her, Mom?

423
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,119
I think I know.

424
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,599
I've lived here for 30 years or so.

425
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:49,200
I've never seen anyone dare to
speak to Madame like that before.

426
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,559
Do you think
I'm being disrespectful?

427
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,039
Not at all.

428
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,559
It's good, actually.

429
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:00,039
So this family can finally
understand how we feel.

430
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:02,799
They can't just treat us
however they want.

431
00:29:10,079 --> 00:29:11,160
Here she comes again.

432
00:29:17,599 --> 00:29:19,119
Madame said

433
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,160
that if you don't
go over to see her,

434
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,759
she's going to call your father
and tell him about Mrs. Srikanda's

435
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:28,920
lowly behavior due to
her jealousy over her husband.

436
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:32,799
I can assure you.
He's going to die of shock.

437
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:39,319
Madame's words, not mine.

438
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:47,839
Madame.

439
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:51,400
She's here.

440
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,000
It worked.

441
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,960
She's on the way now.

442
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,759
Stop.

443
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:01,880
Stop right there.

444
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,240
- Wait...
- Shush.

445
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,680
You have to approach me

446
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:08,519
by crawling on all fours.

447
00:30:10,599 --> 00:30:12,119
- Crawling?
- On all fours?

448
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:16,000
I don't like people
to just walk over to me,

449
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,359
especially

450
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,799
someone who's supposed
to be my daughter-in-law.

451
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:22,039
If you don't do it,

452
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,799
I'll call and complain
to your father

453
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,680
about how your upbringing

454
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,720
is the reason you're so rude
to your mother-in-law.

455
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,279
Well, hurry up.
What are you waiting for?

456
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:36,519
Alternatively,

457
00:30:36,599 --> 00:30:39,279
you can cartwheel over as well.

458
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,440
So,

459
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,799
what would you like
to talk to me about,

460
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,839
Mother-in-Law?

461
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,079
Pa is so awesome.

462
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,640
Don't you have work to do?

463
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,319
- Go on. Go.
- Come on.

464
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,200
- Let's go.
- Hurry up.

465
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:27,559
Good.

466
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,480
I always have a soft spot

467
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:32,519
for defiant ones like you.

468
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,319
See? I told you
Ms. Pa won't disappoint us.

469
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:43,720
- You're right.
- Tell me about it.

470
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,720
But I'm worried

471
00:31:45,799 --> 00:31:48,440
she might bail once she has to face

472
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,680
Madame and Ms. Nade's wrath.

473
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:54,200
So what would you like
to talk to me about?

474
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:58,440
I initially intended to reach
a mutual understanding

475
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,160
that if you want to stay,

476
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,759
you must obey the rules here.

477
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,279
But it seems

478
00:32:07,839 --> 00:32:09,839
I'll be wasting my breath

479
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,880
because you're always
ready to break them.

480
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,279
I'll only obey the ones

481
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,759
that deserve to be obeyed,

482
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:22,720
not the ones that stem from
a single person's wishes.

483
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:25,079
But this is my house.

484
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,799
And?

485
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,240
Does that mean the inhabitants here

486
00:32:29,319 --> 00:32:32,759
can't live their own life
or have their own opinions?

487
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:36,960
That explains why the people
here seem abnormal,

488
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,880
such as...

489
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,559
Are you actually insulting me?

490
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,000
No, I'm not.

491
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,400
I'm just giving an example

492
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,519
of a pitiful living being.

493
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,119
You don't have to pity me.

494
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,000
I'm perfectly happy.

495
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:54,039
Oh, are you really?

496
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:57,519
If there's nothing else,

497
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,039
I'd like to excuse myself.

498
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,519
Mom,

499
00:33:13,759 --> 00:33:14,960
I can't stand it anymore.

500
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:16,799
Can I deal with her?

501
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,519
Go get a water bucket.

502
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,200
Sure.

503
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:31,920
- Oh?
- What?

504
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,079
I don't need the mop.

505
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,440
- Oh?
- I'll borrow this one.

506
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,279
Where are you taking that, Tang?

507
00:33:38,359 --> 00:33:39,359
Wait.

508
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:47,480
I want to have a word with you.

509
00:33:48,119 --> 00:33:49,200
About what?

510
00:33:54,319 --> 00:33:57,400
Save it for another day
if you can't remember.

511
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,160
Hold on.

512
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,000
I'm going to tell you

513
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:04,759
I don't accept you
as my sister-in-law,

514
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:07,200
just like how I didn't
accept Srikanda.

515
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:10,159
There's no need to tell me that.
I already know.

516
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,079
Then why do you insist on staying?

517
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:15,000
So you people will realize

518
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:17,519
how lucky you were

519
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,519
when Da was your in-law.

520
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:34,119
- Oops. Bull's eye.
- Oh dear.

521
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:35,400
I'm so sorry.

522
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,809
I didn't see your head...

523
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,519
I mean, I didn't see
you standing there.

524
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:47,199
This is just a small lesson
for defying me and Mom.

525
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:56,639
- Smile.
- I am now.

526
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,639
Wait for me too.

527
00:35:02,239 --> 00:35:04,960
- That's a good camera.
- Thank you for the evidence.

528
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,440
What evidence?

529
00:35:08,289 --> 00:35:11,000
Pa! I asked you what evidence.

530
00:35:12,329 --> 00:35:13,880
- Ms. Nade.
- Ms. Nade.

531
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,559
I'm coming.

532
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,289
You're going around.

533
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,440
- Hurry up, okay?
- Just a second.

534
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:20,769
Ms. Nade.

535
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,159
- It hurts.
- Ms. Nade.

536
00:35:23,239 --> 00:35:24,840
Can you get up?

537
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,000
You had it coming.

538
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,159
Why weren't you careful?

539
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:30,519
Mom,

540
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,769
you're rubbing salt
into my wound again.

541
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:35,329
Just you wait.

542
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,960
I'm going to find a way to kick her
out of the house as soon as I can.

543
00:35:39,289 --> 00:35:40,480
Just you wait.

544
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:49,679
Who's texting you?

545
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,079
A friend.

546
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:57,920
I hope it's not
that stupid foreign fling of yours.

547
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,440
I stopped talking to him
ever since you told me to.

548
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,400
Thank you.

549
00:36:18,289 --> 00:36:19,519
Hello, Nai.

550
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,079
Please have a seat.

551
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,960
I'm about to go back to work.

552
00:36:26,039 --> 00:36:27,360
It will be several days
before I return.

553
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,000
So I came by to visit you.

554
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:31,769
Here. I bought you desserts.

555
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,400
Thank you.

556
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,960
How have you been?

557
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:41,000
I'm feeling better now.

558
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:45,559
I know about you and Da's sister.

559
00:36:46,159 --> 00:36:47,679
Congratulations.

560
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,440
Thanks very much.

561
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:53,079
But I'm still worried.

562
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:56,360
I don't know how well Pa is
going to get along with my mom.

563
00:36:57,199 --> 00:36:58,920
There's no need to worry.

564
00:36:59,329 --> 00:37:00,920
Ma'am is a lovely person.

565
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:04,159
She'll take good care
of your new wife.

566
00:37:06,639 --> 00:37:10,039
You really think
my mom's a lovely person?

567
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:11,920
And what about Da?

568
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:14,159
Did you ever see

569
00:37:14,239 --> 00:37:16,199
how my mom treated her?

570
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,400
Don't tarnish this place
with your filthy thoughts.

571
00:37:27,289 --> 00:37:28,519
So?

572
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,809
Was she lovely with Da?

573
00:37:32,679 --> 00:37:34,360
Why are you asking me that?

574
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:39,440
If she doesn't like having an in-law
she didn't choose like people say,

575
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,769
I'll try to help her
and Pa get along.

576
00:37:46,119 --> 00:37:47,679
Dad, you're hurting me.

577
00:37:47,769 --> 00:37:49,639
It's incomparable to
the pain you've caused me.

578
00:37:49,719 --> 00:37:51,039
Remember,

579
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,199
I'm trying to help you.

580
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:55,400
So you have to help me too.

581
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,079
Seduce Madame Nuan's son
and make him your husband.

582
00:37:59,159 --> 00:38:01,719
So both of us can finally be happy.

583
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,920
Ma'am was very lovely to Da

584
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:12,159
to the point that I got jealous.

585
00:38:12,239 --> 00:38:14,360
I wish I had
a mother-in-law like her.

586
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,119
What photos did you send me?

587
00:38:33,199 --> 00:38:34,679
Evidence to prove

588
00:38:34,769 --> 00:38:37,559
that your sister isn't
as innocent as you think.

589
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:39,329
It's my first day here,

590
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,769
and she already
dumped mop water on me.

591
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:45,639
Da lived there for a while. You can
figure out how harsh it was.

592
00:38:45,719 --> 00:38:47,960
Did you provoke her though?

593
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:50,159
I gave you solid evidence,

594
00:38:50,239 --> 00:38:52,239
yet you're still siding
with your sister?

595
00:38:52,809 --> 00:38:53,840
I'm not.

596
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,599
But didn't you marry me

597
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:00,719
to prove that Mom and Nade
aren't good people?

598
00:39:01,289 --> 00:39:03,159
So it's possible

599
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:05,639
you'd make something up
to convince me.

600
00:39:05,719 --> 00:39:06,920
I guess that's all for now?

601
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,559
I have to go.

602
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,400
What?

603
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:22,039
I'm calling to warn you

604
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:24,920
not to cause a scene
just to get evidence.

605
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,480
Why?

606
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,920
Are you worried
you can't accept the truth?

607
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,960
I'm worried I'll get angry with you

608
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:34,599
and accidentally do something
that might upset you.

609
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,599
What are you thinking of doing?

610
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:38,480
I can't give you an answer just yet.

611
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:40,599
You can hold that thought.

612
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,960
But if you're not afraid of death,

613
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,639
then try me.

614
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,400
Don't challenge me, Pa.

615
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,960
Do you think using that tone
with me will scare me?

616
00:40:05,239 --> 00:40:06,880
Dream on. I won't give in.

617
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,289
Pa, it's Thom.

618
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,400
Thom.

619
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,360
Uh...

620
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,559
Hey, Thom. What's the matter?

621
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:22,239
What did you say just now?

622
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,719
Uh...

623
00:40:24,809 --> 00:40:26,599
What did I say?

624
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:27,679
I didn't say anything.

625
00:40:27,769 --> 00:40:30,769
Anyway, how did you get my number?

626
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,920
Oh, Uncle Nit gave it to me.

627
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,119
- Dad gave it to you?
- Yes.

628
00:40:35,199 --> 00:40:36,880
I just dropped by your house

629
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,159
and saw Uncle Nit.
So he gave me your number.

630
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,809
How have you been?
Are you doing all right?

631
00:40:43,679 --> 00:40:44,880
I am.

632
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,719
What about you?

633
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,880
You're married now, aren't you?

634
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,840
Yes.

635
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,079
Congratulations.

636
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,199
Thank you.

637
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:58,480
It feels as if we were playing
outside together just yesterday.

638
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:00,480
And now you're already married.

639
00:41:01,769 --> 00:41:04,599
I don't even have a girlfriend.

640
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:08,119
You still don't have a girlfriend?

641
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,199
That's right.

642
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,329
There's an old saying.

643
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,289
"Finding a nice piece of wood
when the axe is blunt."

644
00:41:35,719 --> 00:41:37,769
Don't rub it in, Dad.

645
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:40,840
Since I've decided to
do this for Da,

646
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,039
I'll have to come to terms
about Thom.

647
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,480
Why would you have to?

648
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:50,400
You're breaking up with Nai
in a few months anyway.

649
00:41:51,239 --> 00:41:52,239
Yes.

650
00:41:52,329 --> 00:41:55,360
But is he still going
to be single by then?

651
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,289
Can I ask you a favor?

652
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:03,119
Protect yourself from Nai.
Both physically and mentally.

653
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:05,360
Don't fall for him, okay?

654
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:06,599
And don't...

655
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:10,159
And don't... don't sleep with him.

656
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:12,199
As for Thom,

657
00:42:12,289 --> 00:42:14,119
I can help you with that.

658
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,679
What are you going to do?

659
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:18,809
Whatever.

660
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:22,119
Anyway, are you ready? Don't you
have an interview tomorrow?

661
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:23,679
Yes, I do.

662
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:25,809
Can I have your blessing?

663
00:42:27,289 --> 00:42:28,769
Why should I?

664
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:32,000
Since that guy...
Mr. what's-his-name called you.

665
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:35,440
It's Mr. Prapas.

666
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:37,679
His name is Prapas.

667
00:42:37,769 --> 00:42:39,329
Yes, Mr. Prapas.

668
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,159
He scouted you
when you were still at uni.

669
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:44,289
You'll get the job for sure.

670
00:42:45,239 --> 00:42:46,360
Thank you.

671
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,920
- Tom.
- Yes, Madame?

672
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,199
Find out why she's here.

673
00:43:16,039 --> 00:43:17,079
Yes, Madame.

674
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,039
Hello, Madame.

675
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,440
My apologies for the wait.
Please have a seat.

676
00:43:28,239 --> 00:43:29,239
Here's your coffee, sir.

677
00:43:29,329 --> 00:43:31,159
Before we discuss
our business today,

678
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:34,289
I'd like to ask you
about something, Assava.

679
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:44,159
Are you Pawinee?

680
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:45,920
Yes, I am.

681
00:43:46,119 --> 00:43:48,079
Please come in. Prapas is ready.

682
00:43:49,239 --> 00:43:50,679
You've already hired someone?

683
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:56,360
But yesterday, you just called
to confirm with me.

684
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,599
I actually wanted you
as a colleague.

685
00:43:59,159 --> 00:44:01,159
But the company's consultant

686
00:44:01,239 --> 00:44:02,800
recommended someone.

687
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,519
And the owner
of the company, Assava,

688
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:08,719
thought that person was
more qualified than you.

689
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,079
I'm really sorry
for wasting your time.

690
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:22,599
Have you already finished
your business here?

691
00:44:26,519 --> 00:44:28,079
This is only the beginning.

692
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:32,119
So the company's consultant

693
00:44:32,239 --> 00:44:35,480
who recommended someone else
for my job is you.

694
00:44:38,639 --> 00:44:42,440
Madame, let's not start
an argument here.

695
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:44,679
Don't worry, Tom.

696
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:48,559
I just want to give my genius
daughter-in-law a reminder.

697
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:52,000
I feel sorry for your father.

698
00:44:52,639 --> 00:44:55,880
His daughter graduated
with a degree from overseas

699
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,920
but won't have the chance
to work at a decent company.

700
00:45:00,639 --> 00:45:02,159
You're a strange one, Madame.

701
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,639
You didn't like Da
being a stay-at-home mom.

702
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,559
But when I didn't want to leech off
your son and start working,

703
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,199
you got in the way.

704
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,199
So what do you actually want,
Mother-in-Law?

705
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:16,880
It's because I don't want you two
to be my in-laws.

706
00:45:18,159 --> 00:45:20,760
Whatever you do or don't do,

707
00:45:21,159 --> 00:45:22,559
you'll always be wrong.

708
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:25,280
How narrow-minded.

709
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:29,920
My mind can get even narrower

710
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,559
for someone who dared to declare
herself my enemy like you.

711
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:36,960
If you think
you're so clever and talented,

712
00:45:38,039 --> 00:45:40,360
I hope you can save yourself.

713
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:58,119
(Nai)

714
00:46:00,039 --> 00:46:01,039
Yes?

715
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:02,639
I called home.

716
00:46:02,719 --> 00:46:04,400
Dao said you went
for a job interview.

717
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:05,800
How did it go?

718
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,840
If your mother didn't use
her connections to wreak havoc,

719
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:10,679
I would've gotten the job.

720
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:13,840
Do you have evidence
my mom did that?

721
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:15,960
I'm hanging up.

722
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:18,840
I don't want to talk to someone
who blindly sides with their allies.

723
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:20,840
- Wait, Pa.
- What now?

724
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:22,920
If you still can't come to terms
with Da's death

725
00:46:23,039 --> 00:46:25,360
and aren't ready to work,
you don't have to right now.

726
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:28,599
Stay home with Nick and take a break
until you feel better.

727
00:46:28,679 --> 00:46:30,079
I can take care of you and your dad.

728
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:31,840
No.

729
00:46:32,239 --> 00:46:33,679
I'm not going to rely on anyone.

730
00:46:34,039 --> 00:46:36,599
But thank you very much
for your good intentions.

731
00:46:36,679 --> 00:46:38,159
But before you said that,

732
00:46:38,239 --> 00:46:40,239
shouldn't you have discussed it
with Madame Nuan first?

733
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,400
I don't think
she'll be okay with that.

734
00:46:49,039 --> 00:46:50,320
Nai.

735
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,760
Oh, Kee?

736
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:53,679
I knew I'd run into you here.

737
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:55,239
Hello.

738
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:58,360
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

739
00:47:02,679 --> 00:47:03,719
Oh, right.

740
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,199
Toi is easy to talk to as always.

741
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,719
Like the project
I discussed with him,

742
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,800
he only suggested minor revisions
and told me to go ahead.

743
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:13,400
- Really?
- Yes.

744
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:16,320
By the way, how long
have you been back?

745
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:17,920
Oh.

746
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,760
Not that long.

747
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,159
But I have
another master's degree now.

748
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:23,280
Gosh.

749
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:26,800
Oh, and what about you?

750
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:28,199
How are you doing?

751
00:47:29,199 --> 00:47:30,639
Da just passed away.

752
00:47:30,719 --> 00:47:34,800
How come you made her sister
your wife all of a sudden?

753
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:38,840
It's complicated.

754
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:41,599
Is your mom okay with that?

755
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,840
You got a new wife right after.

756
00:47:45,239 --> 00:47:46,280
No, she's not.

757
00:47:46,719 --> 00:47:49,800
Pa doesn't get along
with Mom and Nade.

758
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,679
I actually want
to take a long holiday.

759
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,440
I don't want to leave them
alone together without me.

760
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:55,559
It's concerning.

761
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:00,920
Hey,

762
00:48:01,519 --> 00:48:02,760
maybe you should do it this way.

763
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,800
If you don't want to stay away
from home for too long,

764
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,599
then resign from your job

765
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,079
and work with me
as an organizer instead.

766
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,199
I have a degree in engineering.

767
00:48:13,679 --> 00:48:15,960
Would I be up for the task

768
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,159
as an organizer?

769
00:48:17,239 --> 00:48:18,360
Hey.

770
00:48:19,079 --> 00:48:22,119
It's never too late
to learn new things.

771
00:48:28,679 --> 00:48:31,960
Here's the list of companies
where Madame Nuan is a consultant.

772
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,320
Some are located in Thailand,

773
00:48:34,639 --> 00:48:36,840
and some are
in neighboring countries.

774
00:48:38,039 --> 00:48:41,639
But don't ask me in what field
she's a consultant

775
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,480
because it really varies.

776
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,760
I'm guessing in charisma and power.

777
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:49,679
Exactly.

778
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,400
She uses her charisma,

779
00:48:51,519 --> 00:48:53,679
not specialized knowledge.

780
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:00,960
"Singkorn Pokphand."

781
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:02,159
What about it?

782
00:49:03,719 --> 00:49:08,679
It's owned by Lita's father,
the woman Madame wants as an in-law.

783
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:13,719
(Nai)

784
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,400
- Hello?
- Is everything all right at home?

785
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:22,239
It is.

786
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,800
Mm. Thanks very much.

787
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,079
No problem. Bye.

788
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,480
Okay. Thank you very much.

789
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,159
How did it go, Thom?

790
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:41,320
We didn't get it.

791
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:49,840
You're not fooling us with bad news
and then surprising us later?

792
00:49:50,679 --> 00:49:51,880
Why would I do that?

793
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:55,159
Lue's company

794
00:49:55,519 --> 00:49:56,639
got the job.

795
00:49:56,719 --> 00:49:58,800
See? I knew it.

796
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,480
His company has Madame Nuan
as its consultant.

797
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:04,079
Come on. Madame Nuan again?

798
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,239
They keep snatching jobs from us.

799
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:08,960
A small company like ours
can't keep up.

800
00:50:10,239 --> 00:50:11,239
Okay.

801
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:15,119
There's no use blaming other people.

802
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,199
We should blame ourselves.

803
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,079
Maybe our work isn't good enough

804
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:20,800
to go up

805
00:50:21,159 --> 00:50:22,760
against other competitors.

806
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,719
Thom, someone's here to see you.

807
00:50:32,639 --> 00:50:33,880
Pa.

808
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,559
Thank you.

809
00:50:48,800 --> 00:50:50,159
Pa,

810
00:50:50,519 --> 00:50:52,559
I went to see our friends
in our old neighborhood.

811
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:54,519
Everyone kept saying

812
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,920
you've gotten prettier.

813
00:51:01,079 --> 00:51:03,360
- And do you think it's true?
- No.

814
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,639
- Oh?
- You haven't gotten prettier.

815
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,440
But...

816
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:11,880
you've become a lot more beautiful.

817
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,360
I want to deny it,

818
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:20,320
but the evidence is too obvious.

819
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:24,199
You're as bold as always.

820
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,360
Sassy.

821
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:31,880
- Oh.
- Hm?

822
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:33,599
You came all the way here
to visit me.

823
00:51:33,679 --> 00:51:35,719
Is something the matter?

824
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:38,719
I want to apply
for a job at your company.

825
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,559
As a consultant.

826
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:44,719
I heard that your company

827
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:48,800
has a very good work ethic
and is extremely professional.

828
00:51:50,039 --> 00:51:51,400
But you barely get to work
on big projects

829
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,840
because Madame Nuan's connections
take them from you.

830
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:58,000
So I came to help you

831
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,119
get what should've been yours.

832
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,679
Thank you so much, Pa.

833
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,719
But the problem is

834
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,199
that position has never existed
at our company before.

835
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,440
Well,

836
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,360
I can be the first then.

837
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:18,000
I don't want a salary.

838
00:52:18,159 --> 00:52:22,079
I'm only asking for commission
from the gigs I land.

839
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:24,199
But is it going to

840
00:52:25,039 --> 00:52:27,559
cause a problem
between you and your family?

841
00:52:27,639 --> 00:52:28,719
Madame Nuan

842
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:31,679
is your husband's mother after all.

843
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,360
If we're professional enough,

844
00:52:34,639 --> 00:52:37,639
we'll be able to distinguish between
professional and private matters.

845
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:38,800
Whoa.

846
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,920
Madame, I've found some information.

847
00:52:54,199 --> 00:52:58,679
Pawinee graduated from law school
with first-class honors.

848
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:01,760
She got a scholarship to undertake
a master's degree in the US.

849
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:05,079
It was a full ride
and unconditional scholarship.

850
00:53:05,159 --> 00:53:08,280
She worked many jobs
during her her time there.

851
00:53:08,360 --> 00:53:09,400
She was a babysitter,

852
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:11,119
a waitress,

853
00:53:11,199 --> 00:53:12,960
and a teaching
and research assistant.

854
00:53:13,039 --> 00:53:14,199
She never had a boyfriend

855
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,840
and was never involved in a scandal.

856
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,599
She basically has
a pristine background

857
00:53:19,679 --> 00:53:24,039
like a face that's been pampered
with premium cream from France.

858
00:53:24,639 --> 00:53:26,039
I don't believe that.

859
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:28,800
It's really good, Madame.
I'm using it as well.

860
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,000
I don't believe
that's her background.

861
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:35,800
I don't believe

862
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:39,280
that there's a person
as flawless as her.

863
00:53:40,239 --> 00:53:41,960
There must be something

864
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:44,360
I can use to get to her.

865
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:48,519
There has to be something.

866
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:53,119
I've prepared
a personal desk for you

867
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:55,840
so you can have your own space
when you come to work.

868
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,559
Thank you.

869
00:54:02,760 --> 00:54:04,400
What are you looking at?

870
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:07,000
I want to look at you
until I stop missing you.

871
00:54:08,519 --> 00:54:09,880
Do you miss me?

872
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:12,119
- No.
- Oh?

873
00:54:12,199 --> 00:54:13,559
I miss Da.

874
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,559
Again?

875
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:17,159
Again what?

876
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:18,719
Well,

877
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:22,320
people always say they miss Da
when they see me.

878
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,639
I should call a cab.

879
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,079
Pa,

880
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,400
do you feel

881
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:39,480
like you have the courage
to drive a car now?

882
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:44,360
Well...

883
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,920
Yes.

884
00:54:54,199 --> 00:54:55,480
Have you finally managed
to forget about that?

885
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:01,039
Not yet.

886
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,519
But I've gotten better.

887
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:45,920
Hello, Nai.

888
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:47,719
Is everything okay at home, Trai?

889
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:49,800
As okay as always.

890
00:55:50,519 --> 00:55:53,000
Call me right away
if there's anything.

891
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:56,159
You call me so often.

892
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,159
Be careful or you'll lose your mind.

893
00:55:58,239 --> 00:55:59,440
I'm worried.

894
00:55:59,519 --> 00:56:01,480
I have some free time,
so I thought I'd check in.

895
00:56:02,199 --> 00:56:03,280
I'm going back to work now.

896
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,519
Yes, sir.

897
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:16,159
Here. Is it cooler now? Is it?

898
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,599
What do you think?

899
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:20,199
There, there.

900
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,320
- Dao.
- Yes?

901
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,519
What's wrong with him?

902
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:29,000
He's got a temperature.
He's not very fond of it at all.

903
00:56:29,079 --> 00:56:31,000
And it's been very warm lately.

904
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:34,320
So why didn't you
turn on the AC and stay inside?

905
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,519
There's a rule here.

906
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,599
If Mr. Nai isn't home, the AC
shouldn't be turned on before noon.

907
00:56:38,679 --> 00:56:39,880
What?

908
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,360
Is there such a thing?

909
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:43,480
That's right.

910
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,239
Madame claimed that ever since
Mrs. Da started living here,

911
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,320
the electricity bills doubled

912
00:56:49,679 --> 00:56:51,280
even though it wasn't actually

913
00:56:51,639 --> 00:56:53,400
just Mrs. Da using the facilities.

914
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,239
It's worse with Ms. Nade.

915
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,599
She always stays up
talking to a man.

916
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:00,199
She's been talking to a man?

917
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:02,800
But it's not
an ordinary conversation.

918
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:04,320
How?

919
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:05,519
Well...

920
00:57:06,039 --> 00:57:08,360
Tell me, Srikanda.

921
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,360
What should I do
with these electricity bills?

922
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:26,559
But I've been trying to save
electricity as per your orders.

923
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:27,719
That's right.

924
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,840
She barely turns on the AC
for Nick nowadays.

925
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,519
And she rarely uses
the bottle sterilizer,

926
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:37,079
the wet wipe machine,
or any electrical appliances.

927
00:57:37,159 --> 00:57:40,639
Hold on. You're misunderstanding me.

928
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,079
I'm not telling you off about
the electricity bills increasing.

929
00:57:44,159 --> 00:57:46,559
I've already mentally
prepared myself for that.

930
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:49,639
But I'd like to discuss with you

931
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:51,960
something that's been bothering me.

932
00:57:52,519 --> 00:57:54,480
What's been bothering you, Mother?

933
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,760
I feel as if I'm being
taken advantage of.

934
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:02,440
Why do I have to spend money
taking care of a stranger?

935
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,800
Even though you're an in-law

936
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:07,480
and the mother of my grandson,

937
00:58:08,239 --> 00:58:10,480
I'm still not happy about it.

938
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,960
It's not surprising, Mom.

939
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:14,679
You have to work very hard
for your money.

940
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,239
If you give the money to
your children like me and Nai

941
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,480
or the maids in the house
who work for the money,

942
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:22,599
you'll probably be willing to do so.

943
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,119
But if you have to
spend your money on...

944
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:29,039
someone else

945
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:32,159
who's practically useless,

946
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:35,039
it's only natural
you'd feel unhappy.

947
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:40,360
I'll pay for the electricity bills.

948
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:41,880
Mrs. Da.

949
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:46,519
Maybe you shouldn't.
Nai might reprimand me again.

950
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,440
Nai won't find out about this.

951
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:52,400
I promise I won't tell him.

952
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,280
Really?

953
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:58,079
I can do anything

954
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:00,760
if it's going to make
both of you happy.

955
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:06,639
Mrs. Da paid for the electricity
every month after that.

956
00:59:07,599 --> 00:59:09,239
I think

957
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:13,760
Madame and Ms. Nade will make you
pay the bills like your sister did.

958
00:59:16,599 --> 00:59:19,239
I guess I should be
a step ahead of them then.

959
00:59:24,679 --> 00:59:28,599
See? It's 3 a.m.
and Ms. Nade is still up.

960
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:30,719
But she accused Mrs. Da
of wasting electricity.

961
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:33,559
Let's do it, Ms. Pa.

962
00:59:33,639 --> 00:59:34,639
Watch your step.

963
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,119
She's wasting so much electricity.

964
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,599
And yet they made Da pay the bills.

965
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:18,719
I'm here!

966
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,559
Hello.

967
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:45,679
Hi.

968
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,880
Nadedao is here! Hello!

969
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,159
This should be fun.

970
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:05,559
(Nai)

971
01:01:18,760 --> 01:01:19,760
Yes?

972
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,599
How are things, Trai?

973
01:01:22,039 --> 01:01:23,079
A-okay.

974
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:25,000
Don't forget you have to
keep the peace in my place

975
01:01:25,079 --> 01:01:27,119
should anything happen.

976
01:01:27,239 --> 01:01:28,760
And report back to me immediately.

977
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,239
Will do, Nai.

978
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,320
Good.

979
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:39,360
This is Muang Charoen.

980
01:01:39,519 --> 01:01:40,880
It's six years old.

981
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,039
The price is only 32,000 baht.

982
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:45,280
And how much is that one?

983
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,039
- Oh, this one is...
- Madame.

984
01:01:48,199 --> 01:01:49,440
Just a moment.

985
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:51,360
Prakit called.

986
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,400
He said he's about to submit his bid
for the bridge construction project.

987
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,599
He wants you to take care of it.

988
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:59,880
It seems there are
a lot of competitors.

989
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:03,440
If that's the case,

990
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:06,199
I'd like a cut of seven percent.

991
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,920
I will help if he agrees.

992
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:10,079
Yes, Madame.

993
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:12,360
All right.

994
01:02:12,719 --> 01:02:15,639
- How much is that one again?
- This one is 32 years old.

995
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:19,519
The price isn't high either.
It's only 250,000 baht.

996
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:21,239
Madame.

997
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:23,320
What now, Sompit?

998
01:02:23,400 --> 01:02:25,079
Ms. Pa would like to see you.

999
01:02:25,559 --> 01:02:26,800
Tell her to wait.

1000
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:32,159
- Just a moment.
- No problem.

1001
01:02:32,719 --> 01:02:33,719
What do you want?

1002
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:36,639
I'm here to discuss
the electricity bill.

1003
01:02:36,719 --> 01:02:38,559
I'd like to pay it myself.

1004
01:02:38,639 --> 01:02:39,880
Good.

1005
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:42,159
Since you're taking over
your sister's husband,

1006
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:44,199
you should also take over
her responsibilities.

1007
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,800
That's how things should be.

1008
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:47,599
- Sompit.
- Yes, Madame?

1009
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:49,639
- Fetch me the electricity bill.
- Yes, Madame.

1010
01:02:49,719 --> 01:02:53,199
But I'll only pay for the bills of
the house I live in with my nephew.

1011
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:56,400
As for this one, the inhabitants can
pay themselves.

1012
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:57,679
It's only fair.

1013
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,800
How should we split the bills?

1014
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:02,000
It's possible, of course.

1015
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:05,079
I'll get a separate
electricity meter.

1016
01:03:05,159 --> 01:03:09,000
And I'll need a signature to prove
the owner's consented to it.

1017
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:12,840
What if I refuse to sign?

1018
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:15,599
Please don't take
advantage of me, Madame.

1019
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:18,800
You already took advantage
of Da enough in the past.

1020
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,840
Karma is real, you know.

1021
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,880
When did I take advantage
of your sister?

1022
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,480
Didn't you make her pay the bills
for the whole house?

1023
01:03:28,039 --> 01:03:32,039
We lived together after all.
She had to share the burden.

1024
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,159
That makes sense.

1025
01:03:34,639 --> 01:03:38,480
But in this case, you deliberately
took advantage of her

1026
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:41,039
by making her feel guilty for being

1027
01:03:41,159 --> 01:03:44,199
the reason for the increase
in the electricity bills

1028
01:03:44,280 --> 01:03:47,320
so that she'd take
sole responsibility for it.

1029
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,639
This is a large house

1030
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,039
and the monthly electricity bill
is in the tens of thousands.

1031
01:03:52,519 --> 01:03:54,000
My sister didn't work

1032
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:57,000
and she spent most of her savings
to pay for it.

1033
01:03:57,519 --> 01:03:59,920
Didn't any of you
feel sorry for her at all?

1034
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,840
What about her wasting electricity?

1035
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,559
Don't you feel any sympathy for me?

1036
01:04:05,840 --> 01:04:09,000
It's Nade who's wasting electricity.

1037
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:11,280
Don't you dare accuse my daughter.

1038
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:13,679
Since we can't really
reach an agreement,

1039
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:16,159
I guess I'll have to post this clip

1040
01:04:16,239 --> 01:04:19,199
and ask for opinions on social media

1041
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:22,320
about who should be
paying the electricity bill

1042
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:24,559
between a new mom

1043
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:27,039
who tried every possible way
to save electricity

1044
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:30,679
and someone who's always
video calling with a guy

1045
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,280
and refusing to sleep
even though it's already 3-4 a.m.

1046
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:48,480
I'm here!

1047
01:04:57,079 --> 01:05:00,360
Nadedao is here! Hello!

1048
01:05:14,039 --> 01:05:16,000
- Who is it?
- Me.

1049
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:19,360
Mom.

1050
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,320
Coming.

1051
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:27,199
Just a second. I'm meditating
in the bathroom.

1052
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,719
Coming.

1053
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:33,679
I'm coming, Mom.

1054
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:39,880
Don't you have
a meeting to go to today?

1055
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:48,119
Why did you slap me?

1056
01:05:48,199 --> 01:05:49,719
Didn't I tell you

1057
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,760
not to talk to that foreigner again?

1058
01:05:55,360 --> 01:05:57,559
I've already stopped talking to him.

1059
01:05:57,639 --> 01:05:58,840
Liar.

1060
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,119
Look at the state of your bedroom.

1061
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:10,320
Pawinee secretly recorded you
chatting to him last night.

1062
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:17,280
You wore that last night.

1063
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,239
I...

1064
01:06:21,639 --> 01:06:24,360
It was warm last night.

1065
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:28,920
Didn't I tell you not to lie to me?

1066
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,880
I've tried my best to raise you.

1067
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:35,000
I didn't complain
when you refused to find a job

1068
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:36,599
after graduation.

1069
01:06:37,239 --> 01:06:39,000
But instead, you stoop so low

1070
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:41,199
as to continue to talk
to that foreigner

1071
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:44,119
and flash him your breasts.

1072
01:06:44,679 --> 01:06:46,320
Don't call me your mother.

1073
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,679
Pack your things
and get out of my house.

1074
01:06:48,760 --> 01:06:50,480
Mom, no.

1075
01:06:50,559 --> 01:06:51,840
I don't want to go.

1076
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,039
- Let go of me, Nade.
- Mom, I'm sorry.

1077
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:55,719
Let go of me.

1078
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:58,199
Mom, please.

1079
01:06:58,639 --> 01:07:01,639
Please don't
kick me out of the house.

1080
01:07:01,719 --> 01:07:04,320
I'll obey you without question.

1081
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:06,960
Let go.

1082
01:07:10,239 --> 01:07:11,920
I'm sorry.

1083
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,119
I won't talk to him anymore.

1084
01:07:15,559 --> 01:07:17,639
I'll obey you without question.

1085
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:20,760
Please don't kick me out, Mom.

1086
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:23,960
All right.

1087
01:07:24,639 --> 01:07:26,880
I'm going to give you
another chance.

1088
01:07:27,840 --> 01:07:29,639
Remember, Nadedao.

1089
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,480
If you want to live a good life,

1090
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:35,599
you have to choose
only the best things,

1091
01:07:35,960 --> 01:07:40,400
just like how I'm trying to find
the best partners for you and Nai.

1092
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:44,239
Don't make
the wrong choice like I did.

1093
01:07:45,159 --> 01:07:46,719
Do you understand?

1094
01:07:53,840 --> 01:07:57,119
Don't let me find any of you
gossiping about this somewhere else.

1095
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,960
Or I'll fire all of you.

1096
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:01,239
Yes, Madame.

1097
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:05,880
- Ms. Nade.
- Ms. Nade.

1098
01:08:06,639 --> 01:08:07,920
Ms. Nade.

1099
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:16,439
Pawinee!

1100
01:08:23,199 --> 01:08:24,199
Ms. Nade, don't.

1101
01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:25,239
I think we should end things.

1102
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:27,439
Let's keep it this way.
It's kind of fun.

1103
01:08:27,529 --> 01:08:29,399
Singkorn's company just came up
with a new product.

1104
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:33,039
He's looking for a company
to help promote it.

1105
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:34,960
She's competing
against her own husband?

1106
01:08:35,039 --> 01:08:36,569
She doesn't want
to compete against Nai.

1107
01:08:36,649 --> 01:08:38,239
She wants to compete against me.

1108
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:40,159
We call this a cunning woman.

1109
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:42,760
A talented person
who uses their powers for good

1110
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,680
is considered a clever person.

1111
01:08:46,569 --> 01:08:48,529
You're still thirsting after Nai.

1112
01:08:48,609 --> 01:08:50,800
- Did you have to be that harsh?
- So do you still want him?

1113
01:08:50,880 --> 01:08:52,800
- I'm going to file for a divorce.
- I won't let you.

1114
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,279
Nai!
