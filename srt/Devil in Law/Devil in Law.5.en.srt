1
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:36,159
Let's be romantic
like how spouses should be.

2
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,199
I think those two might
be lying to us.

3
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,199
I'll go and find out.

4
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,840
Trai's taking a video of us.

5
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:44,319
The reward for risking my life to
take a video of them.

6
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,439
Madame didn't take
Mrs. Da's necklace away.

7
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,360
You're going to meet

8
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:51,199
the same sticky end
like your sister.

9
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm a lot more brazen than her.

10
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,759
I'm going to convince Pa and Mom

11
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,840
accept each other as family.

12
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,759
You have to love me, Nai.

13
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,759
Nick.

14
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,159
Don't cry.

15
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Nick.

16
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,120
What's wrong with Nick?

17
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:39,879
He probably had a nightmare.

18
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,520
I'll take care of him.

19
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,599
Pa.

20
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,439
I got him.

21
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,520
You should go to bed.

22
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,439
It's fine. I want to stay with him.

23
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,120
It's okay, Pa. I got him.

24
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,360
I said I got him.

25
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,680
I got him.

26
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,879
I said I got him, Nai.

27
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,960
I got him.

28
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:59,599
Sorry to interrupt,
but both of you can go.

29
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,240
I'll stay with Nick.

30
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,280
Let's go.

31
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,560
There, there.

32
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:06,520
I know.

33
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,360
Sure, I'll tell my father for you.

34
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,730
Yes, goodbye.

35
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,120
Dad, Madame Nuan said

36
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,759
she's going to put our products
on display at the expo in Europe

37
00:04:31,839 --> 00:04:34,639
and that we don't even need
to talk to the embassy.

38
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:38,680
What did you do
to please Madame Nuan?

39
00:04:41,839 --> 00:04:43,199
Did it have to do with Pa?

40
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,639
Yes.

41
00:04:48,399 --> 00:04:50,639
Did you upset Pa in any way?

42
00:04:51,279 --> 00:04:52,839
Am I not allowed to upset her?

43
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,519
Of course not.

44
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,959
If you don't see
eye to eye with her,

45
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,240
she might not want to marry me.

46
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,759
You were the one who told me
to steal Nai from Pa.

47
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,079
Don't reveal your plan
by declaring yourself as her enemy.

48
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,439
Learn how to use other people

49
00:05:29,519 --> 00:05:30,920
like Madame Nuan does.

50
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:36,639
Make people believe
that Madame Nuan is the only reason

51
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:39,199
Nai dumped Pa for you.

52
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,959
Also,

53
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,240
Nai would never

54
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,959
be interested in a man-stealer.

55
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,720
What have I done?

56
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,560
It's you, Pa.

57
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:57,160
You are up.

58
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,959
Eat some congee.

59
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,519
Why did you buy me a new phone?

60
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,040
I thought it looked nice.

61
00:07:32,399 --> 00:07:33,600
I wanted you to have it.

62
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,560
- Is that all?
- Yes.

63
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,360
Are you sure

64
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:41,000
it's not because you knew
Nade threw my phone in the water?

65
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,079
She did that?

66
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,120
I had no idea.

67
00:07:44,199 --> 00:07:45,560
I know

68
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,920
you saw the bruise
on my lips last night.

69
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,800
Were you not curious about

70
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,519
what happened to me?

71
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,759
You would tell me

72
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,519
if you wanted me to know.

73
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,079
So do you want to tell me?

74
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,720
No.

75
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,040
It won't do anyone any good.

76
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:05,439
In that case,
let's eat the congee then.

77
00:08:06,959 --> 00:08:08,199
Where are you going today?

78
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:11,240
I'm free. Do you need a ride?

79
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,519
I can go there myself.

80
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,560
What about when you come home?

81
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,639
I can come home by myself.

82
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,480
Call me if you are coming home late.

83
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,639
There's no one else here.

84
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,759
You don't need to act
like a loving husband.

85
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,160
I'm not acting.

86
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,519
I'm worried about you.

87
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,240
Are you not mad at me anymore

88
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,000
for framing your mother yesterday?

89
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,450
I know it wasn't intentional.

90
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,639
Just like last night, when you...

91
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:58,159
I know that wasn't intentional too.

92
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,480
You were drunk.

93
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Yes.

94
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:06,330
I already know that your mother
didn't buy our fake marriage

95
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,330
and that you would never love me.

96
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:10,639
While I was completely wasted,

97
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,480
I came up with the silly idea

98
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:15,330
that you would fall in love with me
if I kissed you.

99
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,960
But you've never had a boyfriend.

100
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:22,210
What made you think
you could win me over with a kiss?

101
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:25,919
I told you it was a silly idea.

102
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,639
Pa.

103
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:29,919
Keep this in mind.

104
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,919
Do not be silly with other men

105
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:36,360
because they won't stop you.

106
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:49,480
Pa, aren't you adding
too much pepper into the congee?

107
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,480
I like...

108
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,639
Pa!

109
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,039
Are you burnt?

110
00:10:40,679 --> 00:10:42,240
Ms. Pa, your friend is here.

111
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,090
Hey, Thom.

112
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:47,330
Hi.

113
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,279
I'm here to pick you up for work.

114
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,519
Would you like to join us?

115
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,450
No, thanks. I already ate.

116
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,519
I'm not hungry anymore.

117
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,159
Let's go, Thom.

118
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,159
What about your hand?

119
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,440
I'm fine now.

120
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:08,600
Hold on. Wait here.

121
00:11:15,799 --> 00:11:18,440
Apply this cooling gel
on your hand during the ride.

122
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,799
It will help with the burn.

123
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,440
Let's go, Thom. Come on.

124
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,399
Nai looked really worried about you.

125
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,519
Well...

126
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,919
I'm his wife.

127
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,440
Of course he's worried about me.

128
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,679
Can you not say that you are
his wife when you are with me?

129
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,720
My ears might seriously bleed.

130
00:11:56,279 --> 00:11:57,840
What's with you?

131
00:11:57,919 --> 00:12:00,039
We've known each other
since we were kids.

132
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,600
Then suddenly,

133
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:03,840
the girl who used to
collect mangoes for me,

134
00:12:03,919 --> 00:12:06,320
who asked me to go to festivals

135
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,799
and even swam together naked,

136
00:12:08,879 --> 00:12:11,279
tells me she has a husband.

137
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,960
I can't get myself to accept it, Pa.

138
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:15,919
Okay.

139
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,879
I won't say it anymore.

140
00:12:27,399 --> 00:12:28,600
Madame.

141
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:33,000
The first email includes the receipt
and the tax invoice from yesterday.

142
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,039
The second email includes details
on the minister's birthday party.

143
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,039
Why host it at a hotel?

144
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,440
It's a waste of money.

145
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:46,440
Aren't you trying to get
the minister to support your bid?

146
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:47,759
Well, yes.

147
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,720
But he might not help us

148
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:53,440
since our competitors
are quite powerful.

149
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,000
So it's better to
tighten the budget.

150
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,559
Let's host it at our house.

151
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,240
All right, whatever you say.

152
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,840
- Tom.
- Yes.

153
00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:05,399
Have you found someone

154
00:13:05,559 --> 00:13:06,759
to teach Pa a lesson?

155
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,519
It's not hard to find someone.

156
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:10,159
But are you sure about this?

157
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,559
You will go to prison
if this goes south.

158
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,399
I'm invincible.

159
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,240
- But...
- Just take care of it.

160
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,480
Yes, Madame.

161
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,440
Mom.

162
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,399
What are you planning to do to Pa?

163
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,159
She tried to expose me.

164
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,960
So I'm going to destroy her.

165
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,120
But I won't aim my gun at her

166
00:13:37,759 --> 00:13:39,080
because that's no fun.

167
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,200
I thought I saw someone.

168
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:10,320
It's all in my head.
I must be going crazy.

169
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,480
The house is on fire!

170
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,080
Uncle Nit!

171
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:41,639
Uncle Nit, wake up!

172
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,879
Fire!

173
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:46,320
Uncle Nit, the house is on fire!

174
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,480
I hear Joy's voice.

175
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,120
No!

176
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,879
Uncle! What do we do?

177
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,159
How did this happen?

178
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,440
Go get water.

179
00:14:58,519 --> 00:14:59,639
Okay.

180
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,559
No.

181
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,519
Uncle, here I come.

182
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,360
Get more water.

183
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,440
It's hot.

184
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,360
The flames are spreading.

185
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,759
Bring more water. Quick!

186
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,840
I'm coming.

187
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,159
Did you bring your phone?

188
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,399
- Yes.
- Call the fire department!

189
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:36,039
How bad is the damage?

190
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,440
I was told the damage is minimal.

191
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:41,039
Ms. Pa's father
didn't get hurt either

192
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,320
since his neighbor
quickly noticed the flames.

193
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:44,960
What a shame.

194
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,240
Her father should have been burnt to
death so he could join Da in hell.

195
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,879
Calm down, Madame.

196
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,519
It's a big day for you.

197
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,519
Having a clear mind will make
everything go smoothly as planned.

198
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,360
The monks are here.

199
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:00,759
Go get Nade.

200
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,279
I'm going to check on
the preparations then.

201
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:11,919
Here.

202
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:15,120
Welcome.

203
00:16:21,679 --> 00:16:22,720
Take off your shoes.

204
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:29,279
Offer the rice first.

205
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,240
Bless you all.

206
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,480
That's a nice photo.

207
00:17:08,519 --> 00:17:10,839
You look beautiful in this photo.

208
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,240
(Fulfilling my duty as a Buddhist.)

209
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:22,170
(#kindnesskeepstheworldgoing)

210
00:17:22,170 --> 00:17:26,359
(Fulfilling my duty as a Buddhist.
#kindnesskeepstheworldgoing)

211
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,359
Five, four, three, two, one, ding!

212
00:17:30,359 --> 00:17:32,410
(Fulfilling my duty as a Buddhist.
#kindnesskeepstheworldgoing)

213
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,559
Hey.

214
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:41,279
Where are you going?

215
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,279
I just finished offering alms.

216
00:17:43,759 --> 00:17:45,440
I spared you some merit

217
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:50,839
as it might put out the flames
at your father's house.

218
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,720
I mean, the flames
inside of your heart.

219
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,599
Hello, Joy.

220
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:12,359
What?

221
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,119
There was a fire at Dad's house?

222
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:16,410
Why did you wait so long to tell me?

223
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,410
Uncle Nit asked me not to tell you.

224
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,839
He said you would get worried

225
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,599
and come to check on him.

226
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,799
Oh no. How's my father?

227
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,359
He's safe and well.

228
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,359
He went to the temple this morning

229
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,720
to find some inner peace

230
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,839
and figure out how he forgot
to turn off the stove.

231
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,890
He was confident
he had already turned it off.

232
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:38,480
Uncle Nit is getting old.

233
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,799
Plus, he lives alone. It's normal
for an old person to be forgetful.

234
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,519
I just finished offering alms.

235
00:18:46,839 --> 00:18:49,000
I spared you some merit

236
00:18:49,079 --> 00:18:54,039
as it might put out the flames
at your father's house.

237
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,599
I mean, the flames
inside of your heart.

238
00:18:59,839 --> 00:19:01,200
He didn't forget to turn it off.

239
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:02,359
What?

240
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,079
Pa might realize
that you gave the order

241
00:19:07,599 --> 00:19:10,079
because of what you said to her
earlier today.

242
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,440
I said it
because I wanted her to know.

243
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,650
She's going to tell Nai about it,

244
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,890
but she has no proof.

245
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:28,440
Who do you think will look like

246
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,759
the victim?

247
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,440
What's wrong, Pa?

248
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What is it, Pa?

249
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:53,890
Okay, I'll take care of it.

250
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,119
See you at the office.

251
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,359
- Thom.
- Oh, hello.

252
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:02,920
Mr. Singkorn.

253
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,799
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

254
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,000
What brings you here today?

255
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:08,119
I'm here to collect the contract.

256
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,799
This is my daughter, Lita.

257
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:16,599
Lita, this is Thomtawee, the owner
of the company Pa works at.

258
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,279
- Hello.
- Hello.

259
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,480
Did Pa not come with you?

260
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,920
No, she didn't.

261
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,319
Do you have a message for her?

262
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,000
I can pass it on to her.

263
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,039
Please send her my regards.

264
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:34,079
She knows what I want
to talk to her about.

265
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,319
All right.

266
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,279
- Good luck then.
- Goodbye.

267
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,410
That Thom guy

268
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,799
wasn't pleased

269
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,039
when you mentioned Pa.

270
00:20:57,279 --> 00:21:00,119
That's because
he's interested in Pa too.

271
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:02,839
How odd.

272
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,440
Why would anyone be interested
in a married woman?

273
00:21:05,519 --> 00:21:07,170
Because it's obvious

274
00:21:07,279 --> 00:21:10,890
that something isn't right
with Pa and Nai's marriage.

275
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,920
They got married for a reason,
but it wasn't love.

276
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:18,359
And we should separate them

277
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,890
before they actually fall in love.

278
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,960
Are they going to fall in love?

279
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,650
Closeness wins over true love.

280
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,170
That saying is still true.

281
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,720
Hey, Pa.

282
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,359
This is Sak
from Good Interior Design.

283
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,519
Sak, this is Pa, and this is Nai,

284
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:50,680
the owner's daughter
and son-in-law.

285
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,000
I see.

286
00:21:52,039 --> 00:21:53,880
- Please take a seat.
- Thank you.

287
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,000
Here it is.

288
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,160
It's the last-minute quotation
you asked for.

289
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,319
Thank you.

290
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:08,160
The price is negotiable.

291
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:09,640
That's all right.

292
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,000
I love how pricy it is.

293
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,440
It looks good.

294
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:19,279
Please pay for the renovation,
Mr. Son-in-law.

295
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,519
You said the damage was minimal.

296
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:29,240
Well, I told Sak

297
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,119
to only use
premium quality materials

298
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,119
to renovate the house.

299
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:38,279
The materials must be strong enough
to keep my father safe.

300
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,799
Also,

301
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:42,559
I offered to double the wage
for the workers

302
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,559
to speed up the renovation

303
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:46,519
as my father doesn't like

304
00:22:46,519 --> 00:22:48,599
having outsiders
going in and out of the house.

305
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:56,920
- Did you bring the contract?
- Yes.

306
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,240
You can go ahead and sign it.

307
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,240
Joy, let's go.

308
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
Please sign it.

309
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:17,920
Did you not tell Nai

310
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:20,680
that Madame Nuan
was behind the arson?

311
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,720
No.

312
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,839
Madame Nuan isn't the type

313
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,599
to accidentally
spill crucial information.

314
00:23:27,599 --> 00:23:29,519
She said it on purpose.

315
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,440
I don't know why she said it,

316
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:33,480
but I'm making her son pay

317
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:35,720
for the damage which she caused me.

318
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:40,880
A stingy woman who doesn't let her
daughter-in-law use her son's money

319
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
won't be able to sit still when
she finds out he's paying for it.

320
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:53,960
Joy.

321
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:58,039
I found Da's shortest skirts
and dresses for you.

322
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:01,440
- Hey, don't body shame me.
- I'm not.

323
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,559
I have no choice.

324
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,559
I work off-site
to get scoops these days.

325
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,119
I don't want to buy new clothes.

326
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,359
With the current economy, I should
save money as much as I can.

327
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,359
Oh my gosh!

328
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:15,920
It's Tee-tee!

329
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:20,079
I finally found it.
I've been looking for it.

330
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,599
Isn't that the T-shirt you used
to wear to sleep as a kid?

331
00:24:24,279 --> 00:24:26,799
Are you sure that's not a rag?

332
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,480
Joy, don't say that.

333
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,480
Tee-tee is really comfy
to wear and...

334
00:24:32,319 --> 00:24:33,440
it smells nice.

335
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,440
Excuse me.

336
00:24:40,319 --> 00:24:42,559
Joy, may I speak with Pa in private?

337
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,680
Sure.

338
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:44,759
Joy.

339
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:46,319
She's all yours.

340
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,000
Be honest and tell me

341
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,519
what you are planning to do.

342
00:24:53,079 --> 00:24:55,240
I just want to see you

343
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,920
take responsibility for me
as my legally wedded husband.

344
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,079
Why?

345
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,480
You had never accepted me
as your husband up until now.

346
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:06,680
I'm sure there's more to it.

347
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,759
No, there isn't.

348
00:25:11,359 --> 00:25:12,440
Tell me the truth.

349
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,559
If you don't tell me,

350
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,920
I'm going to tell your father
that we've kissed

351
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,400
and you initiated it.

352
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,319
You always use my father against me.

353
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,359
- Let go.
- Tell me.

354
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,039
Nai, stop it.

355
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:46,240
- Nai.
- Tell me what...

356
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,519
No!

357
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:52,720
Tee-tee...

358
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240
Oh no.

359
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,640
How am I supposed to wear it now?

360
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,720
Tee-tee?

361
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,960
It belonged to my mother.

362
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,920
I used to wear it as a kid.

363
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,400
Dad and Da kept telling me to
throw it away, but I never listened.

364
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:10,200
I finally found it.

365
00:26:10,279 --> 00:26:13,160
I was going to wear it tonight.

366
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,680
I'll just put it back in the closet.

367
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:04,680
You looked so cute
that I kissed you without thinking.

368
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,920
If you do it again,

369
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,400
I'm going to punch you in the face.

370
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,359
And there's no hidden agenda
behind the renovation.

371
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:16,759
Pa.

372
00:27:20,319 --> 00:27:21,680
Your father should live with us

373
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,640
while the house is under renovation.

374
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:26,279
That way, our two families
will get to bond

375
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:28,079
and learn more about each other.

376
00:27:28,759 --> 00:27:30,680
We might understand each other more.

377
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,920
My father is not going to agree.

378
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,759
What if I can convince him?

379
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:40,119
Are you willing to get to know
my mother if I convince your father?

380
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,559
How exactly?

381
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:42,960
You don't need to know.

382
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:44,559
Just tell me

383
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:47,160
if we've got ourselves a deal.

384
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,200
It's a deal.

385
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:59,119
Keep dreaming. I will never live
under that sick hag's roof.

386
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:02,799
Nit.

387
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,319
It's a good idea.

388
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,880
It's inconvenient to stay here

389
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,359
since the workers
will be walking around.

390
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,160
A happy hut is better

391
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,000
than a gloomy castle.

392
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:17,079
But you will get to be
with your grandson

393
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,759
and beloved daughter at my house.

394
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,200
It won't be as gloomy as you think.

395
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:26,400
Pa's been having trouble
with my mother too.

396
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,880
With you there,

397
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,839
she won't feel so alone.

398
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,519
I'm fine.

399
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:37,039
But you will be happier

400
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,680
with your father there.

401
00:28:40,359 --> 00:28:41,359
How about this?

402
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,319
If you agree to live with me,

403
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,440
I'll do anything you want me to.

404
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,920
- Anything at all?
- Yes.

405
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,720
Swim to the other side for me.

406
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,359
- What?
- What?

407
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,240
Over there. Go.

408
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,640
Go.

409
00:28:57,960 --> 00:28:59,200
Swim to the other side.

410
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,480
Swim to the other side
and swim back.

411
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:05,559
If you happen to come across a dead
dog floating on your way back,

412
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,960
you are allowed to hold onto it.

413
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,079
But if you get eaten
by a giant snakehead first,

414
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:14,960
there's nothing I can do.

415
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,400
- Oh my gosh!
- Is he really doing it?

416
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,559
Uncle.

417
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,559
Go pack your bag.

418
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:38,880
Did you forget that
Nai used to work in the ocean?

419
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:42,559
He's not afraid
of a tiny river, gosh.

420
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,720
Wait, Pa.

421
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,000
Darn it, Nai.
Why did you jump into the river?

422
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:56,039
He might be a good swimmer,
but it's still dangerous.

423
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,680
What's happening to him?

424
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,440
- Oh no.
- Where is he?

425
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,839
- I have a bad feeling about this.
- Hold this for me, Joy.

426
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,359
- What?
- No, Pa!

427
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,440
Help!

428
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,079
- Pa.
- Why did you jump in there?

429
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,799
- Oh no.
- Pa!

430
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,799
Nai.

431
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,559
Darn it. Why did she jump?

432
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:10,839
Oh my gosh.

433
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,279
What happened, Nai?

434
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,599
My leg got stuck on something,
but I'm all right now.

435
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,200
Why are you here?

436
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:19,799
Pa, come back. Oh no!

437
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,000
Uncle!

438
00:31:23,079 --> 00:31:24,240
- Dad!
- Father!

439
00:31:24,319 --> 00:31:25,920
Pa, come help your father.

440
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:27,759
He can't swim.

441
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:29,480
Nit!

442
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,039
Karma

443
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,920
surely gets people fast.

444
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:43,599
Here.

445
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,759
That was satisfying to watch.

446
00:31:49,759 --> 00:31:50,759
Here.

447
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:54,319
- Hey.
- It's hot.

448
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,400
Gosh.

449
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,640
Have you thanked Nai?

450
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,319
Why should I thank him?

451
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:06,039
Pa was the one who saved my life.

452
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,799
Gosh, I'd be crazy to thank him.

453
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,759
- Take this.
- Hey.

454
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:19,640
- Hey, what's your problem?
- Take this.

455
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,480
- What's your problem?
- Take this!

456
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:22,559
That hurts.

457
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,960
Oh, do you feel pain?

458
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:25,799
I thought you were a brainless man

459
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,160
with no feelings

460
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,519
who couldn't tell right from wrong.

461
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:32,440
You were the one who challenged him
but fell into the water yourself.

462
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:34,440
If Nai hadn't saved you,

463
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:36,720
you would have drowned to death.

464
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,279
I know.

465
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,440
Enough with the lecture.

466
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:43,599
Hey.

467
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,720
Come here.

468
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,519
Thanks for your help.

469
00:32:54,359 --> 00:32:55,359
You are welcome.

470
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,000
I don't owe you a favor.

471
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:00,880
It's nothing compared to the fact
that you took Da away from me.

472
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,200
Nai.

473
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,839
Please don't mind

474
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,240
your prejudiced father-in-law.

475
00:33:14,839 --> 00:33:16,079
I would never.

476
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,359
He's right.

477
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:22,839
There's nothing I can do to make up

478
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:25,039
for neglecting Da and the baby.

479
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:28,400
Give it to me. I'll wash it for you.

480
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:31,720
- No, it's fine.
- It's okay. I don't mind.

481
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:33,039
- Thank you.
- Sure.

482
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,160
Pa.

483
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,119
I lent Nai
Art's clothes to change into.

484
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:01,200
- Pa!
- What?

485
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,640
I lent Nai
Art's clothes to change into.

486
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,359
Thanks.

487
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,039
By the way, do you have a charger?

488
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:09,159
Over there.

489
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,599
Don't you mind

490
00:34:16,809 --> 00:34:18,329
people wearing Art's clothes?

491
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:21,360
My husband's been dead
for a long time.

492
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:24,400
He's probably reincarnated by now.
I don't mind.

493
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,679
Art would be happy to know

494
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,719
that you have been
by his mother's side

495
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:34,199
as if she was your own mother

496
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,920
ever since he died.

497
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:40,769
I live with my mother-in-law
because she's kind and generous,

498
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,440
unlike yours.

499
00:34:48,809 --> 00:34:52,840
By the way, is Uncle Nit moving
into Madame's house today?

500
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,039
No.

501
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,480
He's moving in tomorrow.

502
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,000
Madame is expecting
some VIP guests today.

503
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,199
She doesn't want to be disturbed.

504
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,329
Rumor has it it's Madame Kobkul.

505
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:10,639
Right now, there's a rumor

506
00:35:10,719 --> 00:35:15,329
that Madame Nuan wishes to win
the bid for the new power plant.

507
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:17,960
Madame knows people

508
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:19,480
with great connections.

509
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:21,480
They should be able to help her.

510
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,840
It's a chain of connections.

511
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,639
It's normal
in the business industry.

512
00:35:27,199 --> 00:35:31,719
Everyone is certain that
Madame is going to get the project.

513
00:35:32,289 --> 00:35:33,360
Really?

514
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:34,769
Yes.

515
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,880
Pa.

516
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:16,000
Let's take your father
and Nick out for dinner tomorrow.

517
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,480
Let's invite my mother and Nade too.

518
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,289
Tomorrow has yet to come.

519
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:23,119
Let's focus on today.

520
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,809
Why do you say that?

521
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:31,079
Well, I just thought

522
00:36:32,199 --> 00:36:34,440
some people could be
happily in love,

523
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:37,679
but the love of their life could get
locked up to death the next day.

524
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:40,360
Therefore, it's best
to focus on the present.

525
00:36:50,519 --> 00:36:51,679
Have you left the house, Dad?

526
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,840
Good.

527
00:36:57,769 --> 00:37:00,519
Once the guests are fully seated,

528
00:37:00,769 --> 00:37:01,840
serve the welcome drink.

529
00:37:06,119 --> 00:37:09,440
This is sangria,
a drink that originated in Spain.

530
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:13,519
Fruits are fermented
overnight with fine wine.

531
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,719
It's very refreshing.

532
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,960
I overheard
Madame's phone call in the car.

533
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,880
Apparently,

534
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,199
the guests today are descendants
of a royal family from the north.

535
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:32,480
You overheard
the quiet conversation,

536
00:37:32,559 --> 00:37:35,039
but your ears somehow stop working
whenever your wife complains.

537
00:37:35,159 --> 00:37:37,039
- Shut up!
- Holy moly!

538
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:40,840
Listen, do not use that expression
in front of the guests.

539
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,360
And do not gossip.

540
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,119
It's rude.

541
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,360
Get ready. The guests have arrived.

542
00:37:54,769 --> 00:37:56,079
Get in line.

543
00:38:02,679 --> 00:38:03,960
Let's go!

544
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,920
It's an honor

545
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,159
to welcome you to my house today.

546
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:48,809
I'm hosting a tiny party
to welcome you.

547
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,719
It's a small but classy party.

548
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:53,519
It's perfect for every one of you.

549
00:38:57,719 --> 00:38:58,960
What's happening?

550
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:11,920
Dad!

551
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:24,519
It is Pa's father.

552
00:39:58,769 --> 00:40:00,559
- Tom.
- Yes.

553
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,519
Take the guests inside.

554
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:03,880
Yes, Madame.

555
00:40:04,559 --> 00:40:06,599
- This way please.
- All right.

556
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,159
Dad!

557
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:27,559
Come.

558
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,039
Let's go.

559
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:30,329
Let's go.

560
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,119
Come on.

561
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,039
Oh, wow.

562
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,769
Wow.

563
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,360
What on earth is going on?

564
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,119
Who gave you permission
to disturb us?

565
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,519
Stop.

566
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,000
Stop it.

567
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:48,159
Woohoo!

568
00:40:53,199 --> 00:40:54,480
Stop it this instant!

569
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,960
Stop it!

570
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,840
Stop it!

571
00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:00,679
Stop.

572
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:07,480
Did your son not tell you
that I would be moving here?

573
00:41:07,769 --> 00:41:10,289
My neighbors heard
I was moving into a mansion,

574
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:11,679
so they came to send me off.

575
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,639
Nai.

576
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,289
Take care of it now.

577
00:41:17,519 --> 00:41:20,159
Do not let them ruin my party.

578
00:41:20,559 --> 00:41:22,400
Wait. Did you say a party?

579
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,360
Awesome!

580
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:27,440
Hey, Madame is throwing us a party.

581
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,039
Let's have fun! Continue the music!

582
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:33,840
Wow, this is awesome.

583
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,480
Let's go inside, Pa.

584
00:41:35,559 --> 00:41:36,809
You can't enter.

585
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:37,880
No.

586
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,920
No.

587
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,289
- No.
- Don't go inside.

588
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,000
- Stop!
- Come back here!

589
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:45,239
No!

590
00:41:45,329 --> 00:41:46,920
- Stop!
- Come back here!

591
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,039
Don't go inside!

592
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:49,440
Don't go inside!

593
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,079
What's happening? Nai!

594
00:41:54,519 --> 00:41:55,769
Excuse me.

595
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,840
Please stop the music.

596
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:58,960
Oh my goodness.

597
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:04,239
This is sangria,
a drink that originated in Spain.

598
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:07,880
Fruits are fermented
overnight with fine wine.

599
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:10,119
It's very refreshing.

600
00:42:10,199 --> 00:42:12,440
Everyone, the food looks delicious.

601
00:42:12,519 --> 00:42:13,920
What is that? Wow.

602
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,239
Wow, it looks delicious.

603
00:42:15,329 --> 00:42:16,599
What is happening?

604
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:19,719
Give me more of this.

605
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,840
This isn't enough.
Give me some more.

606
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,960
Yes, give me more.

607
00:42:24,039 --> 00:42:26,289
Okay.

608
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:29,119
Yes, bring more of this.

609
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:30,960
Eat anything you want.

610
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:32,119
You can eat anything.

611
00:42:32,199 --> 00:42:36,360
Madame is welcoming us
with a party. Have fun.

612
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,000
Yes!

613
00:42:38,519 --> 00:42:40,440
- It's delicious.
- Enjoy.

614
00:42:40,519 --> 00:42:42,360
- Stay for a while longer.
- Come this way.

615
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,639
Where are you rushing off to?

616
00:42:48,769 --> 00:42:50,679
What is this stick for?

617
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:51,769
- Mom.
- No...

618
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:55,039
Mom.

619
00:42:56,239 --> 00:42:58,360
Cheers.

620
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,920
Music! Play some music!

621
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,480
You want me to dance? You got it.

622
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:21,960
No...

623
00:43:29,559 --> 00:43:30,960
We should leave.

624
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:52,199
Your mother's behind the arson.

625
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,559
This morning, your mother purposely
mentioned the fire at my house

626
00:43:59,639 --> 00:44:01,639
to provoke me.

627
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:05,000
This payback is my message to her
that I'm not afraid of her.

628
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,639
You told me to focus on the present.

629
00:44:08,119 --> 00:44:09,320
But you are the one

630
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:11,760
who is buried in the past

631
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,440
and obsessed with revenge.

632
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,519
You didn't lose a family member.

633
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:20,480
She raised me since I was a baby.

634
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:25,159
She was a sister,
a mother, and a friend to me.

635
00:44:25,239 --> 00:44:26,719
You didn't lose her like I did.

636
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,840
You would never understand.

637
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:30,440
Of course I understand.

638
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,679
Da was my life partner,

639
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:37,079
the mother of my child,

640
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:42,400
and the person I wanted to spend
the rest of my life with.

641
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:46,360
But I can't bury myself in sorrow

642
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,239
because I've got a son to care for.

643
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,039
Nick might still be a baby,

644
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:54,119
but I know
he can sense our feelings.

645
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,559
Can't we move past this together?

646
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:01,639
We'll do it with love

647
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,840
and understanding,

648
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:05,840
without competing
against one another.

649
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:10,400
What kind of woman is good enough

650
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,880
to be your daughter-in-law?

651
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,679
A woman who isn't an easy lowlife

652
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,039
like you and your sister.

653
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,360
Keep the end of your deal.

654
00:45:23,519 --> 00:45:26,679
Once your mother
apologizes to Da's spirit

655
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:29,360
and you give Nick up to me,

656
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:31,840
I'll move past it.

657
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,519
You are not going to stop, are you?

658
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:38,920
You better watch out then.

659
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:42,239
My mother might find out
about your secret.

660
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:43,320
How?

661
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:46,199
Are you going to tell her?

662
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:47,840
I won't need to say a word.

663
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:50,480
My mother will find out on her own.

664
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:53,320
My mother is good at discovering
her enemy's weakness.

665
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,800
But she's better...

666
00:45:56,599 --> 00:45:58,840
at using that weakness
to destroy her enemy.

667
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,760
Think about it.

668
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:03,440
If my mother is really behind
the arson at your father's house

669
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,320
and decided to tell you about it,

670
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:08,039
she must have
something up her sleeve.

671
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,400
And if she finds out
about your secret,

672
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,119
the secret that left a scar
in your life,

673
00:46:14,639 --> 00:46:17,320
imagine what surprises
she will have waiting for you.

674
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:22,800
If you refuse to let it go

675
00:46:23,639 --> 00:46:25,840
and insist on going up
against my mother,

676
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,079
you better be prepared.

677
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:43,519
What is Pa's big secret?

678
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:45,320
It's personal.

679
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:47,360
You don't need to know.

680
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,480
Okay.

681
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,639
Fine, I won't ask about it then.

682
00:46:51,559 --> 00:46:53,400
But I have one question for you.

683
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:56,519
Why did you use her secret
to blackmail her

684
00:46:57,199 --> 00:46:59,159
if you knew
you were going to feel guilty

685
00:47:00,039 --> 00:47:01,480
about it?

686
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:04,440
I wanted Pa to stop
trying to beat my mother.

687
00:47:07,639 --> 00:47:08,760
Talking to Pa alone

688
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:11,320
is not enough.

689
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:14,400
If you wish to stop Pa,

690
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,000
you must stop your mother too.

691
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,480
You are right.

692
00:47:26,039 --> 00:47:27,199
Where are you going?

693
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,639
I'm going to talk to my mother.

694
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:32,880
Stopping Pa alone won't work.

695
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:34,960
I have to stop my mother too.

696
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:39,960
One, two, three.

697
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,639
Wow.

698
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:46,320
Let me see the photos.

699
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,760
You look amazing.

700
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,039
Oh my gosh. These are great photos.

701
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:58,039
With a beautiful model,
any photo would look good.

702
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,239
I look good in every photo.

703
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,039
Why are you still here?

704
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:06,119
Go away.

705
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:07,400
Yes.

706
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,880
Clean up the party.
What are you waiting for?

707
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:22,639
- Yes.
- Yes.

708
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:27,280
Phol, where's my mother?

709
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,719
She's probably in her office.

710
00:48:29,840 --> 00:48:31,039
I see.

711
00:48:33,320 --> 00:48:35,679
Wait. Where do you think
you are going?

712
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,239
To show Nai moral support.

713
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:39,239
He's going to talk to Madame.

714
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:41,440
You are as noisy as your aunt.

715
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:43,360
Leave Mr. Nai alone.

716
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,199
Help me clean up here.

717
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,159
You are not doing your job.

718
00:48:47,239 --> 00:48:48,880
Don't be useless.

719
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:52,039
Go.

720
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:00,920
Caviar!

721
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,400
I should take a selfie with it.

722
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:08,480
All right.

723
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:19,480
Trai.

724
00:49:20,519 --> 00:49:21,519
I'm sorry.

725
00:49:23,159 --> 00:49:25,519
You could have just said
you wanted a photo of me.

726
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:27,760
You didn't need to cover it up.

727
00:49:28,519 --> 00:49:29,679
I see.

728
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,719
Do you want a photo of me or not?

729
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,480
- How about here?
- I...

730
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:35,280
Sure, Ms. Nade.

731
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:36,400
Go ahead.

732
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:39,280
Go ahead. I don't mind.

733
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,320
One, two, three.

734
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,079
That's enough. Gosh, you spammed
the shutter button.

735
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:48,920
Let me see.

736
00:49:53,559 --> 00:49:55,599
You took a blurry photo.

737
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,360
The photos look great.

738
00:49:58,440 --> 00:49:59,440
Here.

739
00:50:00,719 --> 00:50:04,079
You are allowed to look at them
whenever you miss me

740
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,039
but don't use them sexually.

741
00:50:06,519 --> 00:50:07,880
It's disgusting.

742
00:50:08,679 --> 00:50:09,719
All right.

743
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,280
She ate it.

744
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:50,639
That was the last one.

745
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,119
She ate that out of all this food.

746
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,119
- Tom, are you going home?
- Yes.

747
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,480
Are you going inside?

748
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:02,719
- Yes.
- I don't think you should.

749
00:51:03,079 --> 00:51:04,960
The atmosphere in there
is really tense.

750
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,239
Ms. Pa has told Mr. Nai that
Madame Nuan is behind the arson.

751
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,960
Really?

752
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:13,639
What did my mother do?

753
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,599
She suddenly transformed
into a drama queen.

754
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:21,079
Ms. Nade.

755
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,199
Mom!

756
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,480
Why are you crying?

757
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,440
Who did this to you?

758
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:34,079
It's Pawinee.

759
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:36,199
She thinks

760
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:38,880
I burned her father's house down.

761
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:40,719
Oh my goodness.

762
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,960
What evidence does she have
to accuse you of such a crime?

763
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:46,519
Just my words.

764
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:48,360
The words came out wrong.

765
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,440
Oh, do you mean
what you said in the morning?

766
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:54,599
Pawinee misunderstood.

767
00:51:54,719 --> 00:51:57,039
She thinks I started the fire.

768
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:01,159
And you believe her?

769
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:03,519
This is unfair.

770
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,360
I'm not saying I believe her.

771
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:09,920
I'm asking you
if Pa's accusation is true.

772
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:11,719
The fact that you are asking me this

773
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,559
means a part of you believes her.

774
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,719
Yes, I believe you did do it.

775
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:20,079
It wasn't Pa's words
that made me believe so.

776
00:52:20,719 --> 00:52:22,000
What was it then?

777
00:52:23,719 --> 00:52:24,960
You dared to threaten me?

778
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:26,800
Don't ever think
I'll be scared of you.

779
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:28,360
I raised Nai myself.

780
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,880
Why wouldn't I know

781
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:33,079
what I should do to convince him
to obey me?

782
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:37,119
I suddenly realized

783
00:52:37,199 --> 00:52:38,880
what a smart woman you were.

784
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,280
You always find a way

785
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:42,239
to get whatever you want.

786
00:52:42,519 --> 00:52:43,880
On the other hand,

787
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:46,039
you always find a way

788
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:48,760
to get rid of whatever
you don't want.

789
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:52,039
I didn't come here

790
00:52:52,199 --> 00:52:54,559
hoping to get an answer from you.

791
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,920
I just came to tell you

792
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,159
that Pa humiliated you today

793
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,159
because she thinks
you tried to hurt her father first.

794
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,000
It's her way of getting back at you.

795
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:05,159
Do you see now

796
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,320
that revenge doesn't benefit anyone?

797
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:09,960
I'm begging you.

798
00:53:10,679 --> 00:53:12,119
Please live in harmony.

799
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:14,320
If you can't love Pa,

800
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:15,840
you can at least love Nick,

801
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:18,320
the boy who shares our blood.

802
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:20,239
It will make me very happy.

803
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:27,440
Mom...

804
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:43,400
You said Pa was going to cause
a scene if she knew you were behind

805
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,519
the arson

806
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:48,559
and you were going
to play the victim.

807
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:50,960
Who would have known?

808
00:53:51,039 --> 00:53:53,440
Pa's smarter than I thought.

809
00:54:27,159 --> 00:54:28,519
Wait, Officers.

810
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:30,039
Why are you arresting my daughter?

811
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:32,880
Pawinee committed a hit-and-run.

812
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:35,320
And she was younger
than 18 years old when it happened.

813
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:38,320
She's going to be in jail
for a really long time.

814
00:54:39,159 --> 00:54:40,639
It's not true, is it?

815
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:43,079
You have to help me. I'm sorry.

816
00:54:43,159 --> 00:54:45,800
Arrest her, Officers. Arrest her.

817
00:54:46,159 --> 00:54:47,880
She deserves to be executed.

818
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,639
You are not allowed near my son.

819
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:50,760
Nick.

820
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,599
We are going to raise
your sister's son.

821
00:54:56,199 --> 00:55:00,000
Is this the woman
who swore to avenge her sister?

822
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:01,960
Soon,

823
00:55:02,119 --> 00:55:05,840
your father will die from a broken
heart and join your sister in hell.

824
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:08,920
You didn't do it, did you?

825
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,280
Did you?

826
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,400
Dad, I'm sorry.

827
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:13,880
Pa!

828
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:37,639
Yes.

829
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,440
An insider just told me

830
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,480
that Madame Kobkul

831
00:55:41,559 --> 00:55:44,239
is furious with what happened today.

832
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:47,679
She said you disrespected her.

833
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,159
So she's not going to help you
and your client

834
00:55:50,159 --> 00:55:52,599
with the power plant project.

835
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,159
She's betraying me
over this little mishap?

836
00:55:56,239 --> 00:55:59,280
You know,
some people would rather die

837
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,920
than be humiliated.

838
00:56:02,199 --> 00:56:03,840
I'll talk to her myself.

839
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,039
It's too late for that.

840
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,480
Madame Kobkul
has already signed the contract

841
00:56:07,559 --> 00:56:10,440
with your rival company.

842
00:56:10,519 --> 00:56:12,079
Contracts can be terminated.

843
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:14,599
I'm willing to pay
the termination fee.

844
00:56:14,679 --> 00:56:17,480
Don't waste your money on somebody
who looks down on you.

845
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:18,840
What did she say?

846
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:22,239
She badmouthed you to other people.

847
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,039
Listen, she said

848
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:27,199
you threw a tacky party.

849
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,519
It was tasteless.

850
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,559
Then she called you a lowlife.

851
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:33,000
Just say it, Tom.

852
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:34,920
She also said

853
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,840
that she's known you
since your marriage to Mr. Krit,

854
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:42,079
the father of Ms. Nade and Mr. Nai.

855
00:56:42,159 --> 00:56:43,280
She said

856
00:56:43,679 --> 00:56:45,519
Mr. Krit died

857
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:48,280
because you poisoned him.

858
00:56:49,320 --> 00:56:50,639
And that's how

859
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,960
you became as rich as you are now.

860
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,360
- Hurry up.
- Wait for me. I'm doing my best.

861
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,679
Hold on. Who is the liquor for?

862
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:03,920
Madame.

863
00:57:04,119 --> 00:57:05,519
Madame?

864
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:07,039
She doesn't drink hard liquor.

865
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,440
And it's not just a casual drink.

866
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:10,760
She's getting hammered.

867
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,400
Where is everyone?

868
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,159
- Coming.
- Coming.

869
00:57:16,320 --> 00:57:17,960
Get out of the way.

870
00:57:22,239 --> 00:57:24,320
Here we come, Madame.

871
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:29,000
Get out.

872
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:31,119
- Yes.
- Yes, Madame.

873
00:57:38,199 --> 00:57:40,679
What do you think happened to her?

874
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:42,519
How would I know? Let's go.

875
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,159
Come on.

876
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:47,880
Me?

877
00:57:48,639 --> 00:57:49,920
A husband killer?

878
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:07,440
Krit.

879
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:11,360
I love you.

880
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:15,360
Please forgive me.

881
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:01,159
How long have you been up?

882
00:59:02,519 --> 00:59:03,800
What time is it now?

883
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,400
Be honest with me.

884
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:07,599
What's bothering you?

885
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,880
Nothing.

886
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:11,360
You are lying.

887
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,360
You wouldn't have hugged me like
a baby if nothing was bothering you.

888
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,079
I hugged you?

889
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:20,679
Yes, you were squeezing me so tight
that I couldn't breathe.

890
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,400
I thought I was getting possessed.

891
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:25,159
Tell me what's bothering you.

892
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,480
I...

893
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,320
hugged you on Da's behalf.

894
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:39,079
I know you used to love it
when Da hugged you.

895
00:59:39,159 --> 00:59:40,480
I did it on her behalf.

896
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:44,760
I'm going to brush my teeth.

897
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:49,199
Do you not trust me so much
that you have to lie to me?

898
00:59:51,639 --> 00:59:54,679
We've only got each other now.

899
00:59:55,239 --> 00:59:59,119
Just tell me what's bothering you.

900
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:09,199
Fine, I'll tell you.

901
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,440
But you must promise me

902
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,519
that you won't freak out

903
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:16,159
and will listen
to everything I have to say.

904
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,719
What is it? Tell me.

905
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:25,519
Well, I...

906
01:00:26,679 --> 01:00:27,840
I...

907
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:33,360
(Take your medicine)

908
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:43,840
What medicine?

909
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:45,639
It's for my blood pressure.

910
01:00:46,519 --> 01:00:47,599
Don't worry about it.

911
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:50,079
You've been taking
that medicine for years.

912
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:51,800
Why do you need a reminder?

913
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:55,239
I'm getting old.
I need to be reminded.

914
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:59,039
What were you saying?

915
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:00,599
What?

916
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,519
- Oh no.
- What?

917
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:10,559
Dad, wait for me here.
I need to use the toilet.

918
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:11,840
What's with her?

919
01:01:27,199 --> 01:01:29,000
- Dad!
- What?

920
01:01:29,079 --> 01:01:31,119
Can you fix the faucet for me?

921
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,719
What?

922
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,239
It's broken.

923
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:38,800
What's wrong with the faucet?

924
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:40,079
Fix it for me.

925
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:42,960
What's wrong with it?

926
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:46,440
It's working just fine.

927
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:52,960
Hey.

928
01:01:53,480 --> 01:01:54,719
Give it back.

929
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,199
- Give it back.
- Dad.

930
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:58,760
- Stand back. Stop.
- Give me my medicine.

931
01:01:58,840 --> 01:01:59,840
Stand back.

932
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,559
Since you won't tell me,
I'll find out myself.

933
01:02:03,639 --> 01:02:04,800
Stop.

934
01:02:04,880 --> 01:02:06,159
Don't come any closer.

935
01:02:09,440 --> 01:02:10,440
(Mr. Panit Pipitpat)

936
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:14,039
(Isosorbide dinitrate)

937
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,480
It's medicine for a heart condition.

938
01:02:29,159 --> 01:02:30,280
Is everything all right?

939
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,559
I heard loud bangs from upstairs.

940
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:36,000
How long have you had it?

941
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:38,239
Not long ago.

942
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,079
Soon after Da passed away,

943
01:02:42,559 --> 01:02:45,079
I started to feel
sharp pains in my chest.

944
01:02:45,639 --> 01:02:47,719
I asked Orn to take me
to the hospital.

945
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,880
Why didn't you tell me?

946
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,679
I didn't want you to worry about me.

947
01:02:53,960 --> 01:02:55,119
Come on.

948
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:58,239
Don't look so miserable.

949
01:02:58,440 --> 01:02:59,599
The doctor says

950
01:02:59,679 --> 01:03:03,119
my heart condition can go away with
medicine and a good amount of rest.

951
01:03:03,199 --> 01:03:06,480
Nothing is going to happen to me.

952
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:07,960
Hold on.

953
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:10,800
Don't you need the toilet anymore?

954
01:03:11,039 --> 01:03:12,480
I thought you had a stomachache.

955
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:16,079
It went away.

956
01:03:17,719 --> 01:03:18,760
In that case,

957
01:03:19,639 --> 01:03:21,239
can you finally tell me

958
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:25,440
what on earth is bothering you?

959
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,400
If you don't want
my heart to overwork

960
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,719
from worrying about you,

961
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:34,119
tell me the truth, Pa.

962
01:03:40,199 --> 01:03:42,519
Here is what's been bothering me.

963
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:46,559
I'm starting to fall for Nai.

964
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:47,960
What?

965
01:03:49,639 --> 01:03:51,159
You're starting to fall for Nai?

966
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:53,280
I...

967
01:03:54,199 --> 01:03:55,199
Well.

968
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,320
Nai is kind
and takes good care of me.

969
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:02,559
My heart's starting
to sway for him...

970
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:06,519
Just a little though.

971
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:08,800
But you promised me

972
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:11,000
that you wouldn't fall for him.

973
01:04:11,159 --> 01:04:15,159
Are you okay with sharing
a husband with your sister?

974
01:04:15,159 --> 01:04:17,679
Let me tell you now
that I'm not okay with it.

975
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,880
- Dad.
- What?

976
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,760
Calm down.

977
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,239
That's why

978
01:04:24,639 --> 01:04:26,239
I feel troubled by it.

979
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:28,400
But don't worry.

980
01:04:29,559 --> 01:04:32,920
To me, no one
is more important than you.

981
01:04:33,719 --> 01:04:36,719
If you don't want me
to love him, I won't.

982
01:04:37,679 --> 01:04:41,280
You've already lost a daughter
because of him.

983
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:43,440
I won't let him

984
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:45,559
steal me away from you too.

985
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:54,039
I'm going to get over him.

986
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,559
Is everything all right?

987
01:05:14,800 --> 01:05:16,119
Yes.

988
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:17,840
I'm going to work.

989
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,400
Nick, come to me.

990
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:26,079
- Aren't you going to drive Pa?
- No.

991
01:05:26,320 --> 01:05:27,719
She can find her own way to work.

992
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,320
I'm going to help you get over me.

993
01:05:53,079 --> 01:05:54,320
(Uncle Nit)

994
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,880
Yes, sir.

995
01:06:01,119 --> 01:06:03,280
Hey, Thom, my future son-in-law.

996
01:06:03,360 --> 01:06:06,119
You need to step up
your game with Pa.

997
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,480
Did something happen?

998
01:06:07,719 --> 01:06:09,280
It's Pa.

999
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:10,840
She confessed to me

1000
01:06:10,920 --> 01:06:13,119
that she's starting
to have feelings for Nai.

1001
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,920
She says Nai takes good care of her.

1002
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:17,960
Don't let him win.

1003
01:06:18,360 --> 01:06:20,840
Yes, sir.
I'm not going to let him win.

1004
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,000
That's good.

1005
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:31,039
Why did you lie to Uncle Nit that
you were starting to fall for Nai?

1006
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:35,360
I couldn't come up with an excuse.

1007
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,840
Are you sure you are not
really starting to fall for him?

1008
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:40,519
Are you crazy?

1009
01:06:40,599 --> 01:06:41,840
I'm not.

1010
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:48,079
Orn and I have known for a while
that you are falling for him.

1011
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:50,840
You are the only one
who can't see that.

1012
01:06:51,639 --> 01:06:52,920
Or you are just

1013
01:06:53,159 --> 01:06:55,519
too afraid to admit it.

1014
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,320
Stop it.

1015
01:06:57,679 --> 01:07:00,079
He destroyed my family.

1016
01:07:00,159 --> 01:07:02,119
How can I fall for him?

1017
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,159
Time will tell. We will see

1018
01:07:06,239 --> 01:07:09,280
if you will be able
to resist him in the end.

1019
01:07:09,840 --> 01:07:11,880
By the way,

1020
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,880
so what's the thing

1021
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:16,239
that's been bothering you?

1022
01:07:17,679 --> 01:07:18,800
It's better that you don't know.

1023
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,440
Tom.

1024
01:07:36,119 --> 01:07:37,679
What time is it?

1025
01:07:38,239 --> 01:07:40,039
What events do I have
scheduled for today?

1026
01:07:40,119 --> 01:07:41,119
None.

1027
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,719
I've canceled
all of your appointments today.

1028
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,960
I want to give you the whole day

1029
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:49,159
to recover
from last night's drinking.

1030
01:08:02,159 --> 01:08:04,280
You should clean your face.

1031
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:07,039
You will feel freshened up.

1032
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,880
Followed by a cup of hot tea
to cure last night's hangover.

1033
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,439
It will freshen you up

1034
01:08:22,529 --> 01:08:25,199
and get you ready
for a day of relaxation.

1035
01:08:26,119 --> 01:08:27,239
Enjoy, Madame.

1036
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:42,920
Orn and I have known for a while
that you are falling for him.

1037
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:45,529
You are the only one
who can't see that.

1038
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:48,680
Pa.

1039
01:08:50,529 --> 01:08:51,960
- Pa.
- Yes.

1040
01:08:52,920 --> 01:08:54,000
What is it, Thom?

1041
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,439
Do you remember

1042
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,079
how you used to ask Da and me to
suck its nectar when we were kids?

1043
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:06,079
Of course.

1044
01:09:06,569 --> 01:09:08,479
But Da wouldn't do it with me.

1045
01:09:08,720 --> 01:09:10,649
- She said it wasn't hygienic.
- That's right.

1046
01:09:10,649 --> 01:09:12,319
You were the only one
who would suck its nectar with me.

1047
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,439
You are the best.

1048
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:18,720
Shall we try it again?

1049
01:09:19,479 --> 01:09:21,479
- Sure. Okay.
- Pick one.

1050
01:09:22,039 --> 01:09:23,039
Okay.

1051
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,720
They look like secret lovers.

1052
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:43,960
These are toilet cleaning supplies.

1053
01:09:44,039 --> 01:09:45,479
Use them to clean your mouth.

1054
01:09:45,569 --> 01:09:46,960
No!

1055
01:09:48,479 --> 01:09:51,159
I'm going to call for dad.
You'll lose your head for sure.

1056
01:09:51,439 --> 01:09:52,720
Before that happens,

1057
01:09:52,760 --> 01:09:53,840
I'm worried

1058
01:09:54,079 --> 01:09:55,960
you might lose your mind first.

1059
01:09:56,039 --> 01:09:58,439
Get inside Pa's bedroom
and search the whole place.

1060
01:09:58,529 --> 01:10:00,000
Does that mean

1061
01:10:00,079 --> 01:10:02,039
you're agreeing to
work with us, Madame?

1062
01:10:02,119 --> 01:10:04,880
The only person I'll give permission
to follow me around

1063
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:06,760
is my daughter-in-law.

1064
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:08,359
You have to accept the job
and follow my mom around.

1065
01:10:08,359 --> 01:10:09,920
I think we'd kill each other

1066
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,920
if we were in close proximity.
