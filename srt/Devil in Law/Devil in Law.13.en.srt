1
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,439
Nai.

2
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:39,319
Mom!

3
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,199
You have to take care
of this for me then, Thom.

4
00:02:42,439 --> 00:02:43,680
Everything has to stop

5
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:44,840
when the clock strikes three.

6
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,719
Between the woman
who does a stupid thing,

7
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,000
marrying the husband
of her own sister

8
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,439
to take revenge on your mother,

9
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,039
and me,

10
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,439
who do you choose?

11
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,599
This is Dumkerng,

12
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,240
the person you've been
searching for.

13
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,960
You're not dead.

14
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,000
Do you want to go
for a swim together?

15
00:03:05,199 --> 00:03:06,680
I want to know what it's like.

16
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,080
Come on, Pa.

17
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,879
No, Pa!

18
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,639
Enjoy the swim, Nai.

19
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,759
I'll be waiting up here. Why were
you in such a hurry to jump in?

20
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,840
Pa!

21
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,240
- You...
- Isn't it refreshing?

22
00:03:31,319 --> 00:03:32,879
Do you understand how it feels now?

23
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,400
I do.

24
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,639
All right then.

25
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,719
Nai, that's enough.

26
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,919
I'm soaked. Stop it.

27
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,560
I won't. Here you go.

28
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,240
Are you sure about that?

29
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:46,919
- Yes.
- All right then.

30
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,719
You won't stop, will you?

31
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,000
What are you doing?

32
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,479
How about it now?

33
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,080
How does it feel?

34
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,560
Hey.

35
00:04:35,839 --> 00:04:37,079
I told you

36
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,759
that once you loved me,

37
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,399
I would do the thing
I've been wanting to do.

38
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,680
Can I do that thing today?

39
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,000
I...

40
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,199
love you.

41
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,680
Coming.

42
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,120
Who are you here for?

43
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:39,399
I'm here to see Nade.

44
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,839
Please take a seat.

45
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:50,399
I'll let Ms. Nade know
that she has a guest.

46
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,360
Would you like something to drink?

47
00:06:54,439 --> 00:06:56,920
Hot coffee will do.

48
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,120
- You got it.
- Thank you.

49
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,040
Who is this?

50
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,800
He's Mr. Tin, Ms. Nade's friend.

51
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,519
Hello, Madame.

52
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:11,879
Are you Nade's friend?

53
00:07:12,439 --> 00:07:13,600
How do you know each other?

54
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,720
We met coincidentally.

55
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,839
Are you interested in her?

56
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,519
Yes.

57
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,000
Tell me about your family.

58
00:07:22,079 --> 00:07:24,000
My family resides in America.

59
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,120
We own a logistics
and export company.

60
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:29,560
My father wants to expand
his business to Thailand,

61
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:31,199
so he sent me.

62
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:35,279
That's right.
If you agreed to be our consultant,

63
00:07:35,439 --> 00:07:39,560
it would make my father
very happy and proud of me.

64
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,600
But I'm not happy about you.

65
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:44,519
Do you think

66
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,160
I can't tell who's a fraud?

67
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,759
Save your story

68
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:54,040
and deceitful tricks
for someone else.

69
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,720
You can't fool us.

70
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,000
If you try, it'll be the end of you.

71
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,959
- Tom.
- Yes.

72
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,120
Don't let him inside my house again.

73
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,079
Yes.

74
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,879
Please leave.

75
00:08:29,839 --> 00:08:31,000
What now, Mom?

76
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,559
Tin, I'm calling to tell you

77
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,840
that you can take back
the money you gave us

78
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,919
for your dad's medicine.

79
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,240
I received a large sum of money.

80
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:45,120
From where?

81
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:48,759
I met with the driver
who hit your dad.

82
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,799
They seem really rich.

83
00:08:50,879 --> 00:08:53,279
Are you sure they are rich?

84
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:54,559
I'll ask for more money then.

85
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,090
Don't do that.

86
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,960
Ms. Pa has been feeling
extremely guilty all this time.

87
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,090
And Mr. Nai, her husband,
came looking for your dad.

88
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,559
Wait, Mom.

89
00:09:06,799 --> 00:09:09,279
What did you say
their names were again?

90
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,519
Her name is Ms. Pa.

91
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,600
Her husband is Mr. Nai.

92
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:15,559
Do you know their last name?

93
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,720
I do.

94
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:20,399
They gave me a name card.

95
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,799
Why do you ask?

96
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,879
I know people with those names.

97
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,450
His name is

98
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,330
Noppanai

99
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,519
Wongkulthanasup.

100
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,799
Wongkulthanasup?

101
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,039
It's really him.

102
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:02,090
You know,

103
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,330
I wish I could expose
Pawinee's secret to my mother.

104
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:12,120
My mother would reward me by letting
me live my life the way I want

105
00:10:13,330 --> 00:10:15,600
and love whoever I want.

106
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,360
My mother hates Pawinee's guts

107
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:24,759
because she knows
Pawinee is hiding a secret from her.

108
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,330
Could my father's hit-and-run

109
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:34,720
be the deep dark secret
of Madame's daughter-in-law?

110
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,450
Why did you come back?

111
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,679
I need to talk to Madame.

112
00:10:49,879 --> 00:10:50,960
Wait.

113
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:54,120
Madame can't talk right now.

114
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,919
Madame!

115
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,360
I told you to leave.

116
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,200
Or I'll call the police.

117
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,600
Madame, I have something important
to tell you. Madame!

118
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,600
- Madame!
- Tang!

119
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,279
- Madame!
- Stop yelling.

120
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,720
Come on. I need help.

121
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,159
- Get him out.
- Madame!

122
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,879
- I need to talk to you.
- You can't go inside.

123
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,840
- Calm down. Please leave.
- You can't go inside.

124
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,919
- You'll get us in trouble.
- Madame!

125
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,559
What now?

126
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,080
I came back to tell you
Pawinee's secret.

127
00:11:28,879 --> 00:11:30,080
Nade told me

128
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:33,600
that you were looking
into Pawinee's secret.

129
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,320
I'm certain

130
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,919
that I will be of help to you.

131
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
This way.

132
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,639
Ms. Pa's secret? What secret?

133
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,600
What is Ms. Pa's secret?

134
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:04,679
How would I know?

135
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,480
Yes, Dao.

136
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,679
Tin, Ms. Nade's friend, is here.

137
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:21,480
He told Madame that
he knew what Ms. Pa's secret was.

138
00:12:21,679 --> 00:12:24,120
But I don't know
what secret he was talking about

139
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,399
since Madame is talking
to him privately in her office.

140
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,120
Hold on.

141
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,440
He's coming out.

142
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,519
He looks happy.

143
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Dao, don't tell Pa about this yet.

144
00:12:37,399 --> 00:12:38,759
I'll take care of it.

145
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,559
Yes.

146
00:12:55,039 --> 00:12:56,039
Wait a second.

147
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,840
Hey, Trai.

148
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,720
Welcome.

149
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,639
You can leave your shoes on.

150
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Hello.

151
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,559
Ms. Nade, this is my friend, Aun.

152
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,879
Aun, this is Ms. Nade.

153
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,360
- She's my girlfriend.
- It's nice to meet you.

154
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,279
Make yourself at home.
I was just heading out.

155
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,240
This way.

156
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:26,679
Trai.

157
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:27,879
I put Joobjang's stuff

158
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,799
in the drawer.

159
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:31,559
Okay.

160
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,480
By the way,

161
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:42,960
do you want me out for the night?

162
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:44,960
Don't be a pervert.

163
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:46,799
- Go. Just leave.
- I'm kidding.

164
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,200
Wait.

165
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,919
Ms. Nade.

166
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,080
Bye bye.

167
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,759
- See you.
- Go away.

168
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
I'm leaving.

169
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,000
Ms. Nade!

170
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,759
It's kind of romantic
to be alone with you.

171
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,360
What's inside the drawer?

172
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,759
Why won't you let me look inside?

173
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:27,120
I didn't say you couldn't look.

174
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,679
Trai.

175
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:31,120
Fine.

176
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,159
Aun keeps his porn in the drawer.

177
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,960
I didn't want your soft
and clean hands to touch it.

178
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:03,960
Where's the washroom?

179
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,639
Over there, Ms. Nade.

180
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
Okay.

181
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,159
- Trai!
- What?

182
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:27,840
There are piles
of used clothes on the floor

183
00:15:27,919 --> 00:15:31,279
and dirty dishes in the toilet sink.

184
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,559
Aun always makes a huge mess
whenever he's alone.

185
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:38,320
Wait for me here. I'll clean it up.

186
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,279
- Okay.
- Wait a moment.

187
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,960
Who are you here for?

188
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,890
I'm here to see Trai.

189
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,319
Ms. Nade.

190
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:12,599
I cleaned the washroom for you.

191
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:14,920
Trai!

192
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,960
Joobjang?

193
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,170
Trai, who is this?

194
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,960
My name is Joobjang.

195
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:34,599
I'm his ex-girlfriend.
We broke up not long ago.

196
00:17:36,599 --> 00:17:37,920
And why are you here?

197
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,359
Trai.

198
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,680
I have good news.

199
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:47,039
I'm pregnant.

200
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,279
- Pregnant?
- Pregnant?

201
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,170
Come.

202
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:53,170
Come here.

203
00:17:57,170 --> 00:18:00,079
Didn't you tell me

204
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,960
that you wanted a baby with me?

205
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:05,519
I made your wish come true.

206
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:11,410
We should reach an understanding

207
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,680
and get back together.

208
00:18:16,599 --> 00:18:17,799
Oops.

209
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,559
I was busy celebrating the news.

210
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,319
So who is this woman?

211
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,119
She's a friend.

212
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:48,599
Did I say friend?

213
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,039
She's not a friend.

214
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,440
She's my new girlfriend.

215
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,039
Ms. Nade!

216
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:55,410
Ms. Nade, wait! Ms. Nade!

217
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,960
Ms. Nade, wait!

218
00:18:58,519 --> 00:18:59,519
Ms. Nade!

219
00:19:27,079 --> 00:19:29,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

220
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:31,559
You got dressed up.
Where are you heading, Lita?

221
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm having dinner with Thom.

222
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,039
I happen to know someone
who has a crush on Thom.

223
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,890
I'm setting them up.

224
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,319
I see. It's a blind date.

225
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,599
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

226
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:47,410
How would Thom feel

227
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,890
if that person was dressed

228
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,680
like me?

229
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:53,240
He would love it.

230
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:56,200
Thom always glances at women

231
00:19:56,519 --> 00:19:58,000
who dress sexily.

232
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:01,559
You are exaggerating.
It's making Thom look bad.

233
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,410
- All men look at beautiful women.
- Yes.

234
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,839
- We actually have to go.
- Okay.

235
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,319
- Bye.
- Bye.

236
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:11,119
- Get home safely.
- Thank you.

237
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:22,920
Hello.

238
00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:24,680
Hello, Lita.

239
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,119
I'm almost there.

240
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:29,680
Has that person arrived?

241
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:32,410
Yes, she's right here.

242
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:37,200
I see. Tell her I'm sorry
for keeping her waiting.

243
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,410
Sure.

244
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,000
I'll pass the message on
to your soon-to-be girlfriend.

245
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,410
Wait, Lita.

246
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,119
Which restaurant are we going to?

247
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,170
Well...

248
00:20:57,410 --> 00:20:58,410
Nade?

249
00:21:02,519 --> 00:21:03,599
Nade?

250
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:16,410
Yes?

251
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,799
I'm still at the office.

252
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:23,559
You want me to check
who Lita is with?

253
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Lita is with...

254
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:36,170
Nade, Madame Nuan's daughter.

255
00:21:36,839 --> 00:21:38,079
Are you sure

256
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,279
there's no one else there?

257
00:21:40,359 --> 00:21:42,119
I only see the two of them.

258
00:21:43,079 --> 00:21:44,680
Okay, Aon. Thanks.

259
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:45,960
I'm hanging up.

260
00:21:51,759 --> 00:21:53,519
Nade has a crush on me?

261
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,920
Seriously?

262
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,680
Trai never told me
he had a girlfriend.

263
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,599
What did you say?
I couldn't make sense of it.

264
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,000
Trai has a girlfriend.

265
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,119
He has a girlfriend,
but he never told me.

266
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,240
Okay, Nade. I understand.

267
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,079
How about this?

268
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,279
Go home and calm yourself down.

269
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,799
Or you can wait at the store.

270
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,599
Once I'm done with Thom,
I'll go see you right away.

271
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,079
You choose some guy over me?

272
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,000
What?

273
00:22:34,839 --> 00:22:39,359
I had never taken a taxi before
in my life, but I took one here.

274
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,640
Aren't you even

275
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,960
going to listen to me?

276
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,119
Listen, Nade.

277
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,000
I have feelings for Thom,

278
00:22:47,079 --> 00:22:49,359
and I'm going to tell him today.

279
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,799
Don't you see how fabulous I look?

280
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:56,920
Therefore, you can't stay
and be our third wheel.

281
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,759
Hey.

282
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,440
Excuse me.

283
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,440
Thom asked me to tell you

284
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:14,720
that he has an urgent meeting
with a client.

285
00:23:14,759 --> 00:23:15,759
He can't make it anymore.

286
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:16,799
What?

287
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:21,759
Why didn't he call me himself?

288
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,279
Well, his phone was running out of
battery when we were talking.

289
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:28,279
So he left a message
for you instead.

290
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,000
This means you have time
to comfort me now.

291
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,079
Sit down.

292
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,720
You know,
when I looked into his eyes,

293
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,559
I was ready to give him everything.

294
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:04,720
Why did it end up like this?

295
00:24:07,119 --> 00:24:08,200
Why?

296
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,279
I don't understand
why my relationship...

297
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,960
Hey.

298
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,079
Did you just hit me?

299
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,039
Tin, Ms. Nade's friend, is here.

300
00:24:35,119 --> 00:24:37,920
He told Madame that
he knew what Ms. Pa's secret was.

301
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:44,799
Mr. Nai, Madame is back.

302
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,319
Thank you, Dao.

303
00:24:55,519 --> 00:24:57,359
- Pa, I'll be right back.
- Yes.

304
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,759
Okay.

305
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:00,920
Your daddy will be right back.

306
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,200
Aw.

307
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,680
Mom.

308
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,160
What is it, Nai?

309
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:39,200
What did Tin say to you?

310
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:45,920
Do you know him?

311
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,759
I don't know him personally.

312
00:25:48,839 --> 00:25:51,599
But I know he's trying
to approach Nade

313
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,920
with bad intentions.

314
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:56,839
He even got her drunk on purpose.

315
00:26:00,519 --> 00:26:04,000
Did he get her drunk, or did she
voluntarily drink the liquor?

316
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,519
How can you ask that?

317
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:11,559
You would understand

318
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,839
if you had stayed home more.

319
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,480
You have no idea.

320
00:26:15,559 --> 00:26:19,039
While you were out
with your school friends,

321
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:20,519
studying abroad,

322
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:23,119
or spending time
with your family at that house,

323
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,519
I had to drag your sister home
countless times.

324
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,039
Even so,

325
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:34,039
it doesn't mean we can let
a dangerous man into our lives.

326
00:26:35,759 --> 00:26:36,759
You are right.

327
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:40,359
We shouldn't welcome
a dangerous person into our family.

328
00:26:41,759 --> 00:26:42,880
Do you want to know

329
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:46,519
what Tin told me
about Pawinee's secret?

330
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,240
Yes.

331
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,799
When she was a teenager,

332
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,519
she was involved in a hit-and-run.

333
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,440
I don't buy it though.

334
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,039
Why not?

335
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:02,680
I could tell without your help
that he's bad news.

336
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:06,799
Nade told him
that I don't like Pawinee.

337
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:10,039
So he must have made up this story

338
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,960
hoping to get something from me.

339
00:27:31,519 --> 00:27:32,519
Oh my.

340
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,799
Pa.

341
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,960
You scared me.

342
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,279
Since when do you take
such long showers?

343
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:43,519
My chest hurt,

344
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,960
so I was taking things slow.

345
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,599
Gosh.

346
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:50,960
Dad, you should see the doctor.
I'll take you there.

347
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:52,960
It's unnecessary. I'm fine.

348
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,400
Don't bother. Sit down.

349
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Come on.

350
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,279
- Let's talk about you.
- What?

351
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,480
You look happy.

352
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:07,039
You must have heard

353
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,839
about me and Nai.

354
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:11,319
Of course.

355
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,160
Thom called me.

356
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,079
Remember this day, Pa.

357
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,960
This is the day you broke
a man's heart into a million pieces.

358
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:20,519
Dad.

359
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,759
What do I have to do
for you to forgive me?

360
00:28:23,839 --> 00:28:25,920
Why do you want my forgiveness?
What?

361
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,799
I was talking about Thom, not me.

362
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Oh, what?

363
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,759
What about you?

364
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:36,839
How do you feel about this?

365
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:43,680
I'm happy for you.

366
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:49,119
- You are happy for me?
- Yes.

367
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,839
I thought you would be mad at me.

368
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,759
I'm going to win Pa's heart...

369
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:01,839
in two days.

370
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,359
If I can't make Pa say
that she loves me in two days,

371
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,599
I'll walk out of your lives.

372
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,880
But if I can do it,

373
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:15,400
you have to accept me
as your son-in-law.

374
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,599
Nai was able to win your heart.

375
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,839
I don't have the right to be upset.

376
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,880
What about you?

377
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,559
Did you fall on your head?

378
00:29:24,759 --> 00:29:27,559
Did you forget that Nai's mother

379
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,160
is the reason your sister's dead?

380
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:33,279
Dad.

381
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:35,839
Madame Nuan

382
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,440
might not be as terrible
as we thought.

383
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:45,200
I won't say anything
because it's you.

384
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,279
Promise me one thing though.

385
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,759
When the time comes

386
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:52,119
that you are certain

387
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,319
Madame Nuan is a wicked devil,

388
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,599
you must walk away.

389
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,079
Don't use your love for Nai

390
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,039
as an excuse to put up with her.
Do you understand?

391
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,079
I promise.

392
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,039
- Good.
- I promise.

393
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,200
You promise?

394
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:11,799
Yes, I promise.

395
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,880
- Hey!
- What?

396
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,119
What is it?

397
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,400
Tell me what Nai did

398
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,559
to win you over.

399
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,200
- Dad.
- What?

400
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,759
I have something to tell you.

401
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,599
It's something

402
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,519
I have kept...

403
00:30:41,519 --> 00:30:43,000
Dad?

404
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,599
Dad, what's wrong?

405
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,880
I...

406
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,559
My chest hurts.

407
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,759
- What's wrong?
- It hurts.

408
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:51,839
My chest hurts, Pa.

409
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,200
Dad!

410
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,200
Dad!

411
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,200
Dad!

412
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,640
Dad!

413
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:10,279
The chest pain he felt yesterday

414
00:31:10,359 --> 00:31:12,440
was a sign of a heart attack.

415
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,559
You did a great job bringing
the patient here so quickly.

416
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:18,079
There would have been a high chance
of the patient not making it

417
00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:20,759
if he had been left untreated
for a long period of time.

418
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,960
What can we do

419
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:29,839
to make him well again?

420
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:35,319
I have to run blood tests,
do an EKG, and examine him closely.

421
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,400
Only then can I decide what
treatment is best suited for him.

422
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:40,359
Okay.

423
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,960
Please excuse me.

424
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:44,400
Thank you.

425
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,480
Don't worry, Dad.

426
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:55,440
I will do everything
to make you better.

427
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,200
Everything?

428
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,319
Yes.

429
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:07,440
Here's the first thing you can do.

430
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,440
Get this punk

431
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,759
away from me.

432
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,079
Dad, you said you would accept him.

433
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,319
I agreed to let you two be together,

434
00:32:28,759 --> 00:32:31,200
but it doesn't make me
hate him less.

435
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,920
Gosh.

436
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,720
What?

437
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:41,279
Look at him.

438
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,519
He's still standing here
with his stupid face.

439
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:45,799
- Darn it.
- Calm down.

440
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:59,079
Please forward the briefing to me.

441
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,480
Yes.

442
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,319
Thom.

443
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,519
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

444
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:23,279
Hello, Nade.

445
00:33:24,079 --> 00:33:25,839
What brings you here?

446
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:27,880
I lost my wallet.

447
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,440
I think I dropped it near the pool.

448
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:31,599
So I came to look for it.

449
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,920
I'll go look for it.

450
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,000
Good.

451
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,119
So...

452
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,799
Why don't you take a seat?
I'll fetch you a drink.

453
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:45,960
It's okay. I'm in a hurry.

454
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:47,599
I see.

455
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,640
Listen.

456
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,680
I know it's rude to keep
my sunglasses on inside. I'm sorry.

457
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,519
It's just that my eyes are swollen

458
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,960
from crying all night.

459
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,000
I'm...

460
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,480
I'm sorry.

461
00:34:08,039 --> 00:34:09,360
Why are you sorry?

462
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,289
Well, I'm sorry

463
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,599
for making you cry.

464
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,289
I hope you find yourself
a good man one day.

465
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,809
You knew that
I fell for the wrong guy?

466
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,920
Well.

467
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:24,840
I've known for a while.

468
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,840
What? Why didn't you warn me then?

469
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,199
- Well, I...
- I see.

470
00:34:30,289 --> 00:34:31,960
You have been working with Pawinee.

471
00:34:32,039 --> 00:34:33,960
- I...
- You wanted to break my heart

472
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:35,679
to avenge Srikanda.

473
00:34:35,769 --> 00:34:37,559
No, it's not what you think.

474
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:40,639
You jerk!

475
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,599
- Jerk!
- I found it!

476
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:46,199
What?

477
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,679
Hey...

478
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:58,769
Don't look at me like that.

479
00:34:59,289 --> 00:35:01,880
I really had no idea

480
00:35:02,289 --> 00:35:03,599
she had a crush on me.

481
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,719
- Thom.
- What?

482
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:17,400
Does she really have a crush on you?

483
00:35:21,769 --> 00:35:22,769
Yes.

484
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,480
Sompit. Tang.

485
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,400
Where is everyone?

486
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:34,719
Bring my shopping bags inside.

487
00:35:35,679 --> 00:35:36,679
Ms. Nade.

488
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,519
You wouldn't answer my calls.

489
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,809
I don't talk to taken men.

490
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,559
I'm only taking custody of the baby.

491
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:48,400
Jang and I

492
00:35:48,809 --> 00:35:50,440
had already broken up.

493
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,119
We will only share custody.

494
00:35:54,159 --> 00:35:56,000
Let's get back together.

495
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,960
I would rather stay
fabulously single

496
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,239
than be with
an insincere guy like you.

497
00:36:09,329 --> 00:36:10,679
I'm a sincere man.

498
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:11,769
Is that so?

499
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,599
Ms. Nade, I...

500
00:36:22,559 --> 00:36:24,079
You can ask me

501
00:36:24,159 --> 00:36:26,960
to do anything to prove
my sincerity to you.

502
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:28,639
I'm willing to do anything.

503
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:39,400
Ms. Nade, where are you going?

504
00:36:40,199 --> 00:36:42,159
- Make it clean.
- What is that?

505
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:43,289
Why is it like that?

506
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,400
Auntie Erb.

507
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:46,920
Yes, Ms. Nade.

508
00:36:47,679 --> 00:36:51,559
Did you know your nephew got fired
from his company a long time ago

509
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:55,519
because he was always late to work
from watching soccer all night?

510
00:36:55,769 --> 00:36:56,769
Ms. Nade.

511
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,329
And he didn't just watch soccer.

512
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,199
He bet on soccer matches too.

513
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:01,199
My goodness.

514
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,119
Also, congratulations.

515
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,880
You're going to be a grandma.

516
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,239
Your aunt doesn't even know
a thing about you.

517
00:37:16,559 --> 00:37:18,679
So don't say you are a sincere man.

518
00:37:33,809 --> 00:37:35,199
Auntie, I...

519
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:39,199
- You ungrateful child. You liar.
- Auntie.

520
00:37:39,329 --> 00:37:40,559
How could you do this to me?

521
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:42,119
- He's your nephew.
- How could you do this to me?

522
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:43,440
- Calm down.
- How could you do this to me?

523
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,079
He's your nephew.

524
00:37:55,519 --> 00:37:56,519
We are here.

525
00:37:58,289 --> 00:37:59,639
Wait.

526
00:38:00,289 --> 00:38:02,679
What are we doing here?

527
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,480
We are having a romantic dinner.

528
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,159
What?

529
00:38:14,719 --> 00:38:15,719
I see.

530
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,289
Are you disappointed
I brought you to this restaurant?

531
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:26,119
No.

532
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:30,960
I'm just curious why you said
it was going to be a romantic dinner

533
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:34,039
when it's just
an ordinary noodle shop.

534
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,159
You will realize

535
00:38:36,289 --> 00:38:38,920
why I called it
a romantic dinner soon.

536
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,119
Here you go.

537
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,199
Two bowls of noodles.

538
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,440
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

539
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:47,679
It smells nice.

540
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Thank you.

541
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,559
Let's dig in.

542
00:39:13,039 --> 00:39:16,360
Nai, this is
my favorite noodle shop.

543
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,679
- That's right.
- Oh my gosh.

544
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:23,360
Joy told me you loved this noodle
shop when you were in college.

545
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:25,079
But then the shop changed locations.

546
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:28,079
I did some research
and found their new location.

547
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,960
His children run
the shop now though.

548
00:39:31,289 --> 00:39:33,360
Brother,
food for table one is ready.

549
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,000
All right, sister.

550
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:39,329
You know, I used to dream
about this noodle every night

551
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,920
while I was studying abroad.

552
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,920
See? I'm not just good
at coming up with pickup lines.

553
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:49,239
I'm also good at pleasing
the woman I love.

554
00:39:53,519 --> 00:39:56,809
This is the most romantic dinner
I've ever had.

555
00:39:58,679 --> 00:39:59,840
Let's eat then.

556
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:04,289
Here I go.

557
00:40:48,039 --> 00:40:56,039
(Pork Noodle Shop)

558
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:10,769
Ms. Pa.

559
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,289
Can you sleep with Nick tonight?

560
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:17,079
I don't feel well. I don't want Nick
to catch what I've got.

561
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:19,679
Sure.

562
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,039
Get some rest.

563
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,239
Thank you.

564
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,079
I did what you asked, Mr. Nai.

565
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:42,440
Nai.

566
00:42:43,289 --> 00:42:44,519
What are you doing?

567
00:42:45,329 --> 00:42:46,599
I'm sleepy.

568
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,239
Let me sleep here with you.

569
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:09,840
- Pa.
- Yes?

570
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:12,329
Let's get married

571
00:43:13,679 --> 00:43:14,840
after your father's surgery.

572
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:20,239
I'll talk to my mother about us.

573
00:43:25,719 --> 00:43:27,400
I want Madame Nuan

574
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,289
to accept me

575
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,960
as her daughter-in-law
with open arms

576
00:43:34,159 --> 00:43:36,289
and not because you begged her.

577
00:43:38,519 --> 00:43:40,199
That day will come.

578
00:43:41,639 --> 00:43:43,920
The day my mother is fully confident

579
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,760
that there's no one better
to be her daughter-in-law

580
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:49,519
than you.

581
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,800
What?

582
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,239
All done.

583
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:24,880
That was fast.

584
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,079
Call Joy and ask her if she can hear
the bell at her house.

585
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,159
Okay.

586
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:37,320
Hello, Joy.

587
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,920
Hey, Pa.

588
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,559
I'm about to ring the bell.

589
00:45:40,679 --> 00:45:42,559
See if you can hear the sound.

590
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,159
Sure, ring it.

591
00:45:49,679 --> 00:45:52,440
I heard the bell loud and clear.

592
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,320
It works.

593
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:56,679
Great. Thank you.

594
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:06,639
Are you playing a game?

595
00:46:08,599 --> 00:46:10,079
We are not playing a game.

596
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:13,239
Come. If you experience chest pain

597
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,000
when you are alone,

598
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:18,159
please ring this bell.

599
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:20,920
It will send an alarm
to Auntie Orn's house.

600
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,639
Then she will rush here to help you.

601
00:46:26,719 --> 00:46:28,239
It's Nai's idea.

602
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:31,079
Nit.

603
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:33,719
You are lucky to have
such a smart son-in-law.

604
00:46:34,840 --> 00:46:36,679
He's not my son-in-law yet.

605
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:39,159
They may have
registered their marriage,

606
00:46:39,239 --> 00:46:41,360
but there hasn't been an official
ceremony, so it doesn't count.

607
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:45,679
Excuse me, sir.

608
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,480
What are you doing?

609
00:46:49,559 --> 00:46:50,559
Hey.

610
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,480
After you recover from your surgery,

611
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:58,400
Pa and I are hosting
a wedding right away.

612
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,280
Nai.

613
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,320
Do we have a deal, Pa?

614
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,159
Oh my. Did I miss something?

615
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:19,480
They are having a wedding.

616
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,280
Really, Pa?

617
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:24,079
- Yes!
- Yes!

618
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,639
Joy! I...

619
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:28,480
I need my father's permission first
before I can host a wedding.

620
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,039
You have my permission.

621
00:47:30,039 --> 00:47:33,199
This is great.

622
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,480
But...

623
00:47:39,039 --> 00:47:40,960
Madame Nuan

624
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:44,360
must follow the tradition
and ask for Pa's hand.

625
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:45,960
We are not doing it here either.

626
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:47,239
She has to go to the temple

627
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:50,840
and ask for Pa's hand
in front of Srikanda's ashes.

628
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,960
If Madame Nuan can do what I ask,

629
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,719
I will give you my daughter
and my blessing.

630
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,920
How does that sound?

631
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:00,920
How does that sound?

632
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:03,000
How does that sound?

633
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,960
If Kee hadn't called
about the urgent project,

634
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,639
I would stay with you.

635
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:30,159
Don't be a baby.

636
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,360
Go to work. I'll see you later.

637
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,119
- All right?
- Okay.

638
00:48:38,519 --> 00:48:39,519
Bye.

639
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:46,960
(Toi)

640
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:55,840
Hello?

641
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:03,719
Okay, I'll be there soon.

642
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,199
Who was that?

643
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,679
It was Toi, Dum's wife.

644
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,360
The hit-and-run victim.

645
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,360
She wants me to go see her now.

646
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:29,599
Is this her house?

647
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:31,440
Yes.

648
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,360
Do you come here often?

649
00:49:34,119 --> 00:49:35,199
This is my first time.

650
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:42,199
Let's go. They're waiting for me.

651
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:43,599
Okay.

652
00:49:55,679 --> 00:49:57,199
- Hello.
- Hey.

653
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:00,199
I heard an engine.
I wondered who it was.

654
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:03,039
- Come this way.
- Okay.

655
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:06,920
Mister.

656
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:08,559
Hello.

657
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:14,400
The other day, I was showing him

658
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,760
some photos.

659
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,760
We came across a photo of you,
and he started crying.

660
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:24,559
I tried to tell him who you were

661
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,039
and what you did,

662
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:27,960
but he wouldn't listen.

663
00:50:28,039 --> 00:50:29,880
It's like he's forgotten

664
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:33,400
that you apologized to him
the other day.

665
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:36,280
Since that day,
he's been staring into space.

666
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:38,519
He won't eat anything either.

667
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,639
He's been biting his nails

668
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:44,400
and thinking about
who knows what for days.

669
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:47,039
That's why I called you.

670
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,280
You can call me anytime.

671
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,039
Mister.

672
00:50:56,599 --> 00:50:58,920
Do you remember me? It's me, Pa.

673
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:03,639
Dum.

674
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:06,440
This is Pawinee.

675
00:51:07,239 --> 00:51:09,159
It's Pawinee.

676
00:51:09,719 --> 00:51:12,159
Mister, do you remember me?

677
00:51:12,239 --> 00:51:16,800
I apologized to you the other day
for what I did eight years ago.

678
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:19,199
I hit you with my car

679
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,800
and drove away
thinking you were dead.

680
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:31,480
I had been looking for you
as I wanted to apologize.

681
00:51:32,719 --> 00:51:34,079
Do you remember?

682
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,800
You did a great job today,
Mom and Dad.

683
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,440
I'll buy you some good food later.

684
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,159
Tin.

685
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:03,519
You haven't told me

686
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,599
why you asked us

687
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:09,000
to trick Ms. Pawinee.

688
00:52:09,079 --> 00:52:11,239
Are you planning something bad?

689
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,360
I'm not going to hurt her.

690
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:16,239
But someone else might.

691
00:52:16,719 --> 00:52:17,880
Someone else?

692
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,480
I have to go, Mom.

693
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:34,119
Do you remember me?

694
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:38,920
I apologized to you the other day
for what I did eight years ago.

695
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:51,400
So tell me.

696
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,960
What is Pawinee's secret?

697
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,599
When Pa was a high schooler,

698
00:52:57,239 --> 00:52:59,119
she hit...

699
00:53:00,199 --> 00:53:01,320
my relative with a car.

700
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,280
She thought she had killed him.

701
00:53:03,840 --> 00:53:06,440
She was afraid of the punishment,
so she drove away.

702
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,119
I'm not a gullible person.

703
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,440
If you want me to buy your story,

704
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:13,599
give me proof.

705
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:15,400
What will you give me

706
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:17,920
in exchange for proof?

707
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,920
I will give you one million baht.

708
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:24,079
Pa.

709
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,360
Why are you up so early?

710
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,079
What are you doing?

711
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:57,480
I'm cooking breakfast
for your mother.

712
00:54:58,599 --> 00:54:59,840
What's gotten into you?

713
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:02,920
Well.

714
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:07,159
I've decided to take a step back.

715
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:13,039
It might make things better
between me and your mother.

716
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,920
I'm only doing this

717
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:18,840
because I love her son
with all my heart.

718
00:55:32,719 --> 00:55:33,920
Thank you, Pa.

719
00:55:36,679 --> 00:55:38,480
I'll help you.

720
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:42,480
This will be the first meal made by
her future daughter-in-law

721
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:44,840
and her son.

722
00:55:47,400 --> 00:55:48,400
Okay.

723
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:00,239
Come in.

724
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,320
Madame, breakfast is ready.

725
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,519
But...

726
00:57:09,719 --> 00:57:11,800
I didn't cook breakfast today.

727
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,880
Someone else did.

728
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:20,440
You are both a working woman
and a housewife.

729
00:57:20,519 --> 00:57:23,400
Mothers-in-law dig that.

730
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:25,760
- Right?
- Yes.

731
00:57:26,199 --> 00:57:27,480
- Pit.
- It looks tasty.

732
00:57:28,159 --> 00:57:29,559
Where's my mother?

733
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:32,119
She said she won't be joining

734
00:57:32,199 --> 00:57:34,280
because she feels sick

735
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:38,039
from a dish she ate yesterday
called "a lying tramp."

736
00:57:38,599 --> 00:57:41,559
It's her words, not mine.

737
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,800
Dao.

738
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,159
Please watch Nick
while I go get my mother.

739
00:57:52,239 --> 00:57:53,559
That's all right.

740
00:57:54,159 --> 00:57:55,960
It's okay
if she doesn't want to eat it.

741
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:03,079
We don't need her then.

742
00:58:03,159 --> 00:58:04,599
We can eat it by ourselves.

743
00:58:04,679 --> 00:58:05,960
But not here though.

744
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:14,119
All right.

745
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:15,840
Here you go.

746
00:58:16,880 --> 00:58:18,760
- Thank you, everyone.
- Sure.

747
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:21,320
Nick's taking a nap.
Let me take him.

748
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:22,440
Thank you.

749
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:24,639
He's taking a nap in the morning.

750
00:58:24,719 --> 00:58:26,960
Look at him.

751
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,960
He's deep asleep.

752
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:31,639
- You take the towel.
- Thank you.

753
00:58:31,719 --> 00:58:32,880
Thank you.

754
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,639
He's adorable.

755
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:38,199
Let's eat, Pa.

756
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:46,599
What are you

757
00:58:47,239 --> 00:58:48,760
trying to do?

758
00:58:49,239 --> 00:58:50,239
Tell me.

759
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:52,719
I'm showing my mother

760
00:58:53,559 --> 00:58:56,239
that I don't care
if she doesn't want to be included

761
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,320
in our family.

762
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:00,199
I can have a great time
with my family without her.

763
00:59:02,719 --> 00:59:04,039
Let's eat, Pa.

764
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:07,360
Okay.

765
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:13,239
Hey.

766
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:15,559
Can you feed me a tomato?

767
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:20,280
- Do you eat tomatoes?
- Yes.

768
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:23,039
You are a healthy man.

769
00:59:24,199 --> 00:59:25,719
Wow.

770
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:27,480
- It's delicious.
- Really?

771
00:59:27,559 --> 00:59:28,559
It's really good.

772
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:32,639
- What else do you want?
- Anything is fine.

773
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:37,159
Enjoy the moment

774
00:59:37,719 --> 00:59:39,039
while it lasts.

775
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,159
Here.

776
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:53,920
Press your hands on your chest bones
and apply some pressure.

777
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,039
After that, inhale slowly

778
00:59:57,199 --> 00:59:59,920
and expand your rib cage.

779
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:02,000
With maximum rib cage expansion,

780
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:04,159
your hands will be pushed forward.

781
01:00:04,239 --> 01:00:07,199
Hold your breath for three seconds.

782
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:10,559
Count, one, two, three.

783
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:12,639
Relax your muscles

784
01:00:12,719 --> 01:00:14,920
and exhale normally.

785
01:00:17,039 --> 01:00:18,559
Who's here?

786
01:00:18,639 --> 01:00:21,960
Your chest will return
to its original position.

787
01:00:39,199 --> 01:00:40,199
It's her.

788
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,880
I thought I prayed to god
this morning to keep devils away.

789
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,559
Why do I still see a devil here?

790
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:50,599
I'm here to talk about Pawinee.

791
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:58,480
Mister, do you remember me?

792
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:03,320
I apologized to you the other day
for what I did eight years ago.

793
01:01:03,639 --> 01:01:05,599
I hit you with my car

794
01:01:05,719 --> 01:01:09,079
and drove away
thinking you were dead.

795
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:17,039
I feel bad for you.

796
01:01:17,639 --> 01:01:19,519
Your two daughters

797
01:01:19,639 --> 01:01:21,800
bring you nothing but trouble.

798
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:24,559
One got knocked up,

799
01:01:25,199 --> 01:01:27,639
while the other one

800
01:01:28,239 --> 01:01:30,480
almost killed someone with a car.

801
01:01:42,119 --> 01:01:43,239
What do you want?

802
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:49,039
If you don't want this file
to end up with the police,

803
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:53,400
get Pawinee to divorce my son.

804
01:01:55,719 --> 01:01:57,480
I'm not sure

805
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,960
what her sentence would be

806
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:01,960
if she was arrested as an adult

807
01:02:02,280 --> 01:02:04,199
for a crime she committed
as a teenager.

808
01:02:05,199 --> 01:02:06,599
But I happen

809
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:09,079
to have enough money

810
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:10,840
to hire a good lawyer

811
01:02:11,239 --> 01:02:12,920
who can turn this case

812
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,039
into the talk of the town

813
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,480
and get Pawinee in a lot of trouble.

814
01:02:22,519 --> 01:02:24,920
How dare you come here
and threaten me...

815
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:31,599
What's going on?

816
01:02:35,639 --> 01:02:36,719
What are you doing?

817
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,719
Darn it.
Does he have to call me now?

818
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:08,320
Hold on.

819
01:03:17,440 --> 01:03:20,280
Hello. Tid, get the car ready.

820
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:22,519
Why else? Pa asked us

821
01:03:22,599 --> 01:03:24,880
to take her father to the hospital
if he rings the bell.

822
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:27,039
What? You went to the market?

823
01:03:28,519 --> 01:03:32,280
Phol, make a U-turn
and leave the engine on.

824
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,360
All right?

825
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:35,880
Make a U-turn
and get ready to leave.

826
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,920
- Make a U-turn and get ready.
- Okay.

827
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,760
Tid, I got a ride.
You don't need to come back. Okay.

828
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:43,679
What are you doing?

829
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:46,280
I asked, what are you doing?

830
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:47,800
I'm here.

831
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:49,119
Orn.

832
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,360
You...

833
01:03:50,719 --> 01:03:52,960
Are you okay? Let's go.

834
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:54,360
Come on.

835
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:55,920
- Get up.
- Where are you going?

836
01:03:56,519 --> 01:03:58,960
Nit's having a cardiac episode.
He needs to go to the hospital.

837
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:00,519
- What a nice story.
- Let's go.

838
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:02,480
Are you trying to run
from our conversation?

839
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,800
Madame, do you think he's acting?

840
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,159
I have seen

841
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,920
a lot of people using strange
methods to escape from situations.

842
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,400
Faking a heart attack is new though.

843
01:04:13,480 --> 01:04:17,039
I admit that it's a creative idea.

844
01:04:17,599 --> 01:04:19,199
Ignore her. Let's go.

845
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:20,880
Slowly.

846
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:21,960
Where do you think you are going?

847
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:24,000
- Come on.
- Where do you think you are going?

848
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,159
You are not going anywhere.

849
01:04:26,320 --> 01:04:28,039
We need to talk first.

850
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:31,280
Tell Pawinee to divorce my son.

851
01:04:31,360 --> 01:04:33,119
What on earth is your problem?

852
01:04:33,199 --> 01:04:34,800
Don't you see that he's dying?

853
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:35,880
I hope he dies.

854
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,519
He should join Srikanda in hell.

855
01:04:37,639 --> 01:04:39,280
That way, Pawinee will be all alone.

856
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,800
Get out of the way!

857
01:04:41,360 --> 01:04:42,440
No!

858
01:04:42,519 --> 01:04:43,639
Move!

859
01:04:43,719 --> 01:04:44,719
No!

860
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,840
I never back out from anything.

861
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,440
Nit, hold on. Hang in there.

862
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,039
I said, get out of the freaking way!

863
01:04:58,360 --> 01:04:59,760
Let's go.

864
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,800
Are you okay? Walk slowly.

865
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:12,360
Slowly.

866
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,800
Phol, help me!

867
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:17,360
Let's go.

868
01:05:17,440 --> 01:05:19,800
We are steps away from the car.

869
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:21,440
Everything will be okay.

870
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:25,320
Phol, I'll tell the shortcut
to the hospital.

871
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:26,400
Okay.

872
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:28,159
Where's Madame?

873
01:05:28,639 --> 01:05:29,880
She won't wake up anytime soon.

874
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,800
- He's in critical condition. Hurry.
- All right.

875
01:05:33,960 --> 01:05:35,639
Hang in there.

876
01:05:43,079 --> 01:05:44,679
How's my father doing?

877
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,880
Okay, I'll see you there.

878
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:48,440
Pa, what happened?

879
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:49,920
My father is having a heart attack.

880
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,519
Auntie Orn's taking him
to the hospital.

881
01:05:51,559 --> 01:05:52,599
I'll come with you.

882
01:05:52,679 --> 01:05:55,519
You can meet me there.
Taking a car would take too long.

883
01:05:55,599 --> 01:05:57,000
How are you getting there then?

884
01:05:57,079 --> 01:05:58,599
I got a ride.

885
01:05:58,679 --> 01:05:59,800
Aon.

886
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:01,559
Yes.

887
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:04,159
- Let's go, Aon.
- Yes.

888
01:06:05,840 --> 01:06:07,079
Drive safely, Aon.

889
01:06:07,159 --> 01:06:08,159
I will.

890
01:06:14,599 --> 01:06:18,000
Nit, hang in there.
We'll be at the hospital soon.

891
01:06:21,360 --> 01:06:22,559
Orn.

892
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:28,559
Did you know that Pa took my car
and hit somebody with it?

893
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:31,800
How do you know about this?

894
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,039
I see.

895
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:36,519
Did Madame use the accident

896
01:06:36,599 --> 01:06:39,519
to threaten you
into forcing Pa to divorce Nai?

897
01:06:40,519 --> 01:06:41,519
Orn.

898
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:44,559
If I don't make it,

899
01:06:46,519 --> 01:06:48,239
tell Pa

900
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,480
that I'm not mad at her.

901
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,360
Nit.

902
01:06:54,440 --> 01:06:55,519
Hang in there, Nit.

903
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:58,360
Phol, drive faster.

904
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,719
Step on it.
He's not doing well. Go faster.

905
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:04,400
You have to stay strong.

906
01:07:04,880 --> 01:07:08,000
Nit, hang in there.

907
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:09,079
Nit.

908
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:10,800
Drive faster.

909
01:07:35,519 --> 01:07:36,840
How's my dad doing?

910
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,360
He's still inside.

911
01:07:43,480 --> 01:07:45,599
Pa! You are here!

912
01:07:45,679 --> 01:07:47,960
You have to keep it together.

913
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:49,800
Don't worry.

914
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,039
I know that he will be just fine.

915
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,480
Joy.

916
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,800
It's you who needs to
keep it together.

917
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,199
And lower your voice.

918
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:06,760
Doctor.

919
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:10,039
Doctor, how is Nit doing?

920
01:08:10,119 --> 01:08:11,679
The patient is safe now.

921
01:08:12,599 --> 01:08:15,280
However, he needs
to stay overnight here.

922
01:08:15,360 --> 01:08:17,479
Thank you, Doctor.

923
01:08:17,479 --> 01:08:19,479
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

924
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:21,119
Thank you.

925
01:08:22,609 --> 01:08:23,960
Excuse me, Orn.

926
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:27,920
Since you have people
to keep you company now,

927
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:30,079
I'm going to leave.

928
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:32,319
Sure.

929
01:08:35,079 --> 01:08:36,399
Auntie Orn.

930
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,119
Why was Phol here?

931
01:08:41,079 --> 01:08:43,680
Come and take a seat.

932
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:46,840
Sit.

933
01:08:49,609 --> 01:08:52,840
Madame went to see
your father at home.

934
01:08:58,119 --> 01:08:59,479
Don't tell me

935
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,840
Dad had a heart attack because...

936
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,840
She told your father
about your hit-and-run.

937
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,529
How does she know about that?

938
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:14,359
I'm not surprised that she knows.

939
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:18,840
Madame Nuan always gets everything
she wants, including information.

940
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:24,920
And when your father
was having a heart attack,

941
01:09:25,159 --> 01:09:27,920
she wouldn't let me
take him to the hospital.

942
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:32,649
She kept forcing Nit to assure her
that he would make you divorce Nai.

943
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:37,439
She threatened to expose
your hit-and-run if he didn't agree.

944
01:09:38,039 --> 01:09:40,399
She crossed the line.

945
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:45,359
Calm down.

946
01:09:52,529 --> 01:09:53,529
Phol.

947
01:09:53,720 --> 01:09:54,720
Yes?

948
01:09:55,159 --> 01:09:56,199
Wait.

949
01:10:17,439 --> 01:10:19,359
Why did you tell Pawinee about me?

950
01:10:22,399 --> 01:10:23,680
There you are.

951
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:25,680
That's her, Officer.

952
01:10:26,760 --> 01:10:27,880
Please come with us.

953
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:34,680
I can get back at you
without involving others.

954
01:10:34,760 --> 01:10:37,319
How long do you intend
to keep me here?

955
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:39,319
As long as possible.

956
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:40,960
Pa.

957
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:42,239
Is this even necessary?

958
01:10:42,319 --> 01:10:43,439
Isn't it a little too far?

959
01:10:45,039 --> 01:10:46,039
Hey.
