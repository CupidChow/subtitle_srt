1
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,719
We are looking for a company
to help promote our product.

2
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,560
Nai just quit his job
at the oil platform.

3
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:41,960
He's founding an advertising
company with a friend.

4
00:02:42,039 --> 00:02:44,560
He's looking for a company
to promote the product...

5
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:46,360
She's competing
against her own husband?

6
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:48,120
She's not going against him.

7
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,919
She's going against me.

8
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,039
I'm going to tell your father
why you are afraid to drive.

9
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,520
You killed a person with a car.

10
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,680
You were still in high school

11
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,400
and didn't even have
a driver's license.

12
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,319
Nai, you cannot tell
my father about this.

13
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,319
Nai! Nai!

14
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,360
Auntie Orn?

15
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:10,719
Huh?

16
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,360
Ah! Did I forget my phone?

17
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,759
- Can you go a bit faster?
- Sure.

18
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,199
Thank you.

19
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,680
Father?

20
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:32,240
Father?

21
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:40,240
- Oh, Pa?
- Hi, Auntie Orn.

22
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,960
Do you mind paying the cab fare?

23
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:43,840
Oh?

24
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,360
Dad.

25
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,360
Pa,

26
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,000
how could you?

27
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,800
Dad, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

28
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:05,319
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

29
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,759
I'm sorry.
Please don't be mad at me.

30
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,919
Hang on.

31
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,170
Why do you feel guilty about your
sister secretly buying me a present?

32
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,279
Pa really loves you, Father.

33
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,000
That's why she was worried
you might be angry.

34
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,639
What's going on here?

35
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:26,170
I told him

36
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,839
about finding a present
Da meant to give to him.

37
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:34,839
There. A wristwatch worths
hundreds of thousands.

38
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:37,319
Why would she buy it for me?
It's a waste of money.

39
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,800
She probably knew you'd wanted it
for a long time.

40
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,519
Who's asking?

41
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,000
You've done your job bringing it
to me. You can leave now.

42
00:04:46,279 --> 00:04:47,279
Really.

43
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:50,000
What are you standing there for?

44
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,399
And lock the door on your way out.

45
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,050
I'm going to take
a shower. It reeks.

46
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
It reeks of scum.

47
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,120
Hmpf.

48
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,800
How dare you do that to me!

49
00:05:09,839 --> 00:05:12,360
How dare you!

50
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:14,759
- Pa!
- How could you?

51
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:16,319
I did it

52
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,610
because I want you to know fear.

53
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:20,519
So at least you'd realize

54
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:23,319
I'm also a human being with a heart.

55
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,120
You can't treat me however you want
just because you want revenge.

56
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,680
And I want you to keep in mind

57
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,279
that I let you have your way

58
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,560
not because I'm incapable
of doing anything to you.

59
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,240
I refuse to do anything

60
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,560
because you're Da's sister.

61
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,279
Your dad is like my own.

62
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,600
I won't do anything

63
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,240
that will upset him.

64
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,680
I'm sorry.

65
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,959
You can punish me however you want.

66
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,480
But I'm only asking you
for one thing

67
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,759
and that is we have to
keep fulfilling our promise.

68
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,360
Don't worry.

69
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,120
I won't divorce you that easily.

70
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,759
Why not?

71
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,519
Because divorce
isn't the right solution.

72
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,279
The problem will be solved

73
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,839
if you're willing to believe my mom
isn't as bad as you think.

74
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,720
And I'd like that to happen
as soon as possible

75
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,199
so we can finally live peacefully.

76
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,000
But if you are certain

77
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,800
about my mom
hating her daughter-in-law

78
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:25,480
because of her possessiveness
over her son,

79
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:29,040
then I'll help fan the flames

80
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,839
of her possessiveness even more

81
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,879
so she can finally
show her true colors.

82
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,439
Good.

83
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:39,839
So you'll realize sooner
that I was right.

84
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,040
If you're sure you'll let me
follow through with my plan,

85
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,800
you have to accept the fact

86
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,959
that you might have to give
something in exchange.

87
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,199
What?

88
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,560
Your body.

89
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,600
Oh.

90
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,439
That's enough, Pa.

91
00:07:10,519 --> 00:07:11,519
Hey,

92
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,759
I just used the wrong word.

93
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:15,000
I was trying to say

94
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,279
that you have
to let me hold your hand

95
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,560
and embrace you
like people who are in love.

96
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,839
So Mom will be convinced
I love you very much.

97
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,839
Enough. No need to say more.

98
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,199
I understand now.

99
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,120
Oh, right.

100
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:35,040
Pa asked me to give you this.
It's for the cab fare.

101
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
Mm.

102
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,079
Why were they
in such a rush to leave?

103
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:42,360
I was thinking
of cooking them something.

104
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:45,040
I bought fresh oysters
from the market.

105
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,160
They say oysters are an aphrodisiac.

106
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,319
So Nick can have a little sister
or brother to play with.

107
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:52,879
Dream on.

108
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,959
Why?

109
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:56,480
Did you tell Pa not to sleep
with her husband?

110
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,920
You're acting
as if you don't know her at all.

111
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,560
Who on earth can stop her
from doing something?

112
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,959
So what's going on?

113
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,360
You don't have to know.

114
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:05,920
If you don't tell me,

115
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,720
I'm going to tell Pa
you've been drinking every day.

116
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,160
You noticed?

117
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,560
Don't drink in the middle of
the yard if you don't want me to.

118
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,439
Where's my phone?
I think I have it here somewhere.

119
00:08:19,519 --> 00:08:20,759
Wait!

120
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,120
All right. I'll tell you.

121
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:24,639
What?

122
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,639
Pa's legally married to Nai
so that she can avenge Da?

123
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:32,360
Gosh. Why don't you shout out front?
Then the neighbors can hear.

124
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,039
How could you let her do that?
Why didn't you stop her?

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,279
I didn't want to stop her.

126
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,279
I'm scared she might end up like Da.

127
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,480
I forbade Da
from going out with Nai.

128
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,039
So when something was bothering her,

129
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,919
she was too scared
to tell me anything.

130
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,600
But if Nai becomes
your son-in-law again,

131
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,720
you have to come to terms with that.

132
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,279
No way.

133
00:08:56,919 --> 00:08:59,480
Because Pa promised me

134
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,840
she'd never fall in love with him.

135
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,600
But you can't underestimate her.

136
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,519
He's handsome, nice,
polite, and lovely.

137
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:13,879
I'm already at this age
and still find him charming.

138
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,450
Let alone Pa.
She sees him every day.

139
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:25,450
Ms. Pa shouted and begged Mr. Nai.

140
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,480
Tears were streaming down her face.

141
00:09:27,559 --> 00:09:29,360
But Mr. Nai didn't
pay her any attention.

142
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:31,090
Instead, he revved his car

143
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:33,039
and drove right at her.

144
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,330
Good thing Trai was
able to grab her,

145
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:39,799
or she'd already be
in heaven with Mrs. Da.

146
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:42,519
I've never seen Nai
this angry with anyone

147
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:44,480
ever since I was born.

148
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,360
For men,

149
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,279
it's better to be dead
than to be humiliated.

150
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,279
And it's even worse
when the one humiliating him

151
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:53,919
is his own wife.

152
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,399
Mr. Nai and Ms. Pa are back.

153
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,600
Where are you going, Mom?

154
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:05,240
To witness Pa's stupidity.

155
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:14,519
Why are there
so many people outside?

156
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:16,360
We had an argument before we left.

157
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,480
Mom is probably worried.

158
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,559
Worried?

159
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,000
You're thinking of her
in a negative light again.

160
00:10:22,679 --> 00:10:25,210
All right. Let's get started
with our plan

161
00:10:25,679 --> 00:10:27,840
so that you'll realize

162
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:29,639
I don't see your mom
in a negative light.

163
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,039
She's just actually evil.

164
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:34,279
Sure. Let's get started.

165
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,840
What are you doing?

166
00:10:55,919 --> 00:10:58,679
Being romantic
like how spouses should be.

167
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:00,320
You silly girl.

168
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,960
People who have
settled down together

169
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,320
don't just kiss
each other at random.

170
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,720
Since we've already started,

171
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,039
let's just finish it.

172
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:16,399
Ah!

173
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:18,399
Mom, Nai is...

174
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:29,679
What was that?

175
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,759
Well, you kissed me!

176
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,399
I didn't!

177
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,720
I just used my thumb to...

178
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:39,679
I was wondering

179
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,360
why it felt so soft.

180
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,320
- There!
- Ow!

181
00:11:43,879 --> 00:11:44,879
Pa!

182
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,639
Is there something going on?

183
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,320
Pa's just annoyed that I kept trying
to make it up to her.

184
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,120
Why wouldn't I be annoyed?

185
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,159
My lips are all clammy.

186
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,399
Is something the matter, Mom?

187
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,720
I heard you and Pa
had a fight this afternoon.

188
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,960
It was a bit of a misunderstanding.

189
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:16,639
But we've reached

190
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,600
a mutual understanding now.

191
00:12:18,799 --> 00:12:19,919
I think

192
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,759
we might have to ask Dao
to take care of Nick tonight.

193
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,480
I need some private time

194
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,360
to cheer my wife up.

195
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:30,320
I'm warning you now.

196
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,720
I might be a bit hard to please.

197
00:12:33,799 --> 00:12:35,039
Then remember

198
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,240
that I prefer someone
who's hard to please.

199
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,440
It's challenging.

200
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:42,159
Excuse me.

201
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:49,879
That was the first time
you were wrong.

202
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,080
I think those two might
be lying to us.

203
00:12:54,919 --> 00:12:58,000
Nai has never engaged in any
public displays of affection.

204
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,679
But why would they lie to us?

205
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:05,879
They probably didn't want us to ask
what they were arguing about.

206
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,679
You've got a point.

207
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,039
I'll go and find out.

208
00:13:22,799 --> 00:13:23,799
Ah!

209
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,480
Hey!

210
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,759
Get up!

211
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,799
Come on!

212
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,080
Climb up! Climb up!

213
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,399
Nai?

214
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,159
Nai?

215
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,440
Nai, is it possible to look through

216
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:54,240
the curtains from the outside
into this room?

217
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:57,320
It'll be blurry.

218
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,120
What's the matter?
I'm about to head into the shower.

219
00:14:00,759 --> 00:14:01,840
Well...

220
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,480
Trai is about to climb the ladder
and look into your room.

221
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:13,600
Madame and your sister probably
ordered them to spy on us.

222
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
There?

223
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,960
No, that way!

224
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:31,879
That way!

225
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:57,919
Hm.

226
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,879
The weather is nice tonight.

227
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,159
I think I might go to bed
without turning on the AC tonight.

228
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:05,840
Nai!

229
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,639
What are you doing?
Shut it! Why did you open it?

230
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,039
Shut the window!

231
00:15:15,879 --> 00:15:16,960
What are you thinking of doing?

232
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:24,240
If Mom really ordered them
to spy on us,

233
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,200
then we'll have
to make it convincing.

234
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,679
Don't remove the pillow.

235
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,080
Are you nervous?

236
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,559
No.

237
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:47,200
Your heart is racing.

238
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Well,

239
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,279
I'm just nervous

240
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,600
they might find out
we're not really in love.

241
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,840
Then stay still.

242
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:57,919
Let me handle this.

243
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,240
Trai's here.

244
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:16,679
Go to sleep, okay?

245
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,919
You've had a long day today.

246
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,159
Hm.

247
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,240
Maybe you want me to help you
sleep even more soundly?

248
00:16:27,039 --> 00:16:29,000
Ow. Pa!

249
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,759
You always hurt me
when you're embarrassed.

250
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,879
Trai's taking a video of us.

251
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,519
Hmph.

252
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,600
This is a violation of privacy.

253
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,879
This is inappropriate
even if they're family.

254
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:04,680
That's true.

255
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,079
I'll shoo him away then.

256
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,200
Hey!

257
00:17:09,759 --> 00:17:11,039
Hang on.

258
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:13,839
Since it's already come to this.

259
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,200
Nai,

260
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:19,079
I don't think

261
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,519
your mom

262
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,170
and your sister

263
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,799
are very fond of me.

264
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,960
I don't think so.

265
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,039
You're overthinking it.

266
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,720
Let's do it this way.

267
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:39,240
If you were to choose

268
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:41,279
between

269
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,599
me

270
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,359
and your mom,

271
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,279
who would you choose?

272
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,839
What do you say?

273
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:54,599
Which of us?

274
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,240
Let's not talk about other things.

275
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,759
We should talk about us.

276
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:12,960
Nai.

277
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,119
I think he's gone.

278
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,680
Trai's gone.

279
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:14,960
Hey, watch your step.

280
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,440
How did it go? How did it go?

281
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:19,279
I got it.

282
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:22,960
Whoa.

283
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:25,359
Can you send it to me now?

284
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,039
- Oh?
- Come on.

285
00:19:27,119 --> 00:19:28,279
- Now?
- Sure.

286
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,410
Hang on.

287
00:19:29,519 --> 00:19:31,720
- Let's show it to Ms. Nade first!
- That's right!

288
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,680
Oh? Where are you going?

289
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,890
Oh?

290
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,079
What about the ladder?

291
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:40,480
Give me back my phone!

292
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,799
Let's do it this way.

293
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,720
If you were to choose

294
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,720
between

295
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:49,920
me

296
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:52,839
and your mom,

297
00:19:56,440 --> 00:19:58,279
who would you choose?

298
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:08,319
I think you're wrong, Mom.

299
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:11,200
She's really sucking up to him.

300
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:15,890
How could he have fallen for her?

301
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:19,599
She's going to brainwash him
into leaving us next.

302
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:23,279
He's obviously going
to listen to his wife.

303
00:20:24,079 --> 00:20:25,170
No way.

304
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:27,079
I'm his mother.

305
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,599
I carried him for nine months.

306
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,559
I raised him.

307
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:35,279
He can't see anyone else
better than me.

308
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,480
Why did you slam my phone?

309
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,079
The lens is cracked!

310
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,519
Argh!

311
00:20:51,319 --> 00:20:52,319
Oh!

312
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:54,599
- Boo!
- Ah!

313
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,839
Jerk!

314
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,480
You startled me!

315
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,759
What?

316
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:05,720
The reward for risking my life to
take a video of them.

317
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:09,000
You also told me you're going to
give me a special reward.

318
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,559
If you really want one,

319
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,240
I'll let you have it.

320
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,079
But you can't tell anyone else.
I'll kill you.

321
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:21,920
My lips are sealed.

322
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,960
Close your eyes.

323
00:21:27,079 --> 00:21:29,079
Close your eyes.
Do you want it or not?

324
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:30,650
Of course.

325
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,519
But if it's inconvenient for you,

326
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:36,650
you can use the scan feature.
I'll open the app.

327
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:46,559
Because you're Auntie Erb's Nephew,

328
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,170
that's all I can give you.

329
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,359
What?

330
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,759
I was asking for money.

331
00:22:04,079 --> 00:22:05,400
Why did she kiss me?

332
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:48,400
Nai, you can't
have feelings for her.

333
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,160
She's your wife's sister.

334
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,079
Why are you so giddy, Pa?

335
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,279
He's the reason your sister died!

336
00:24:12,279 --> 00:24:13,359
Uncle Nit?

337
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,480
Uncle Nit?

338
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,200
- Hi...
- Stop right there!

339
00:24:16,759 --> 00:24:18,079
- What's wrong?
- Don't come in yet.

340
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,880
I hope you didn't tell Pa
I called you over.

341
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,839
You told me not to. So I didn't.

342
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:25,960
Excellent.

343
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,519
- I have some questions to ask you.
- Okay.

344
00:24:30,079 --> 00:24:32,640
But you have to answer them
in front of a Buddhist amulet,

345
00:24:33,359 --> 00:24:34,680
so you won't lie to me.

346
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,200
Okay.

347
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:38,559
- Do you prefer men or women?
- Women.

348
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,319
Are you hiding any secret
wives or children?

349
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,680
If there were any, I wouldn't
have hidden them.

350
00:24:41,759 --> 00:24:43,599
- What about a girlfriend?
- She hasn't been born yet.

351
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:45,799
- Does that mean you're single?
- Completely.

352
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,000
Why didn't you find someone?

353
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,799
I used to be into someone,
but not anymore.

354
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,079
- How come?
- She's already taken.

355
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,839
Whoa, he's got morals.

356
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,240
You've passed the test.

357
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,039
Are you ready?

358
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,240
For what?

359
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:03,839
To discover Pa's secret!

360
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,200
Here.

361
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,119
You can read it yourself.

362
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:14,119
Not that one. Keep going.

363
00:25:18,119 --> 00:25:20,440
(It's Valentine's. I'm actually hot.
Lots of roses and chocolate)

364
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:22,599
(But the most exciting was Thom.
He visited me at home. Ah!!)

365
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,759
(He brought flowers but not for me.
They're for Da.)

366
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:27,599
(So happy!)

367
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,759
Pa's had a crush on you
for a long time.

368
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,240
And she still does.

369
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:45,160
But isn't she married to Nai?

370
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,640
Come on.

371
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,680
There was a reason
she had to marry him.

372
00:25:49,759 --> 00:25:50,960
It wasn't because of love.

373
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,319
Mr. Nai,

374
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,279
Madame would like
to see you right away.

375
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,440
Pa wanted to be Madame Nuan's
daughter-in-law

376
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:23,759
because she wants Nai to find out
how evil his mother is.

377
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:27,079
So he'll agree to let Pa
and me raise Nick.

378
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:31,200
I knew it. I was wondering
about her weird behavior.

379
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:32,599
Hey,

380
00:26:33,079 --> 00:26:36,359
you can't let Pa know
I told you about this, okay?

381
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,799
I won't. I promise.

382
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,920
But you have to tell me first

383
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,759
why you decided to tell me
Pa's secret all of a sudden.

384
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,400
Do you mind

385
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:50,880
if I ask you

386
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,720
to consider Pa

387
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:55,440
as your future wife?

388
00:26:55,519 --> 00:26:56,599
Agreed!

389
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,400
Aren't you going to
give it a bit of thought?

390
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,599
I don't have to.

391
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:01,519
Guess what?

392
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,160
I've had a crush on Pa
for a long time.

393
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,160
- Really?
- Really.

394
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,200
- Since when?
- Well...

395
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,599
Right from the start.

396
00:27:16,519 --> 00:27:19,119
But we were playmates
when we were kids.

397
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:21,240
So I had to try and stop myself

398
00:27:21,319 --> 00:27:24,880
from thinking of her
as more than a friend.

399
00:27:25,359 --> 00:27:26,720
But do you know

400
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,799
how painful it was
for me to do that?

401
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,000
But from now on,

402
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,680
you have to pick up the pace
and win her over.

403
00:27:36,759 --> 00:27:39,200
Don't let anyone
take her away from you.

404
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,759
Promise, Son-in-Law?

405
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,880
I promise, Father-in-Law!

406
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,160
Attaboy!

407
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,599
Excellent!

408
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:54,079
(Thom)

409
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,920
Yes, Thom?

410
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,920
Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!

411
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,160
Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!

412
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,440
Pa! Pa!

413
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,880
What's wrong? Why are you shouting?

414
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:13,119
I'm feeling super happy today.

415
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,880
So I felt like shouting out
my dear friend's name repeatedly.

416
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,839
Anyway, what are you up to today?

417
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,200
Should we go out for dinner?

418
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:23,559
And we'll talk about the plan
for Mr. Singkorn's job.

419
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,759
Oh, Thom.

420
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,519
Can we save it for another day?

421
00:28:27,599 --> 00:28:28,599
I'm feeling a little exhausted.

422
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,319
I might've overexerted
myself yesterday.

423
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,640
Oh, okay.

424
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,920
Do you feel like eating something?
I'll buy it and drop it off for you.

425
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,720
It's okay. I'll feel better soon.

426
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:41,519
Get a lot of rest then.

427
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,880
I will.

428
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,599
Oh, hang on a second!

429
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,920
Yes?

430
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,160
Hello?

431
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,400
Oh, it's nothing.

432
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:56,279
I'll see you later, okay?

433
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:57,599
Mm.

434
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,559
Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa!

435
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,359
I'm hanging up now.

436
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,640
Bye!

437
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,599
- Jai.
- Yes?

438
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,680
Where's Nick?

439
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,759
He's playing outside with Dao.

440
00:29:27,839 --> 00:29:30,319
Mr. Nai's gone out
to Mr. Singkorn's company

441
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,599
with Madame Nuan.

442
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,240
I guess you're going to eat now.

443
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:36,200
- I'll warm this up for...
- Oh, no need. It's just fine.

444
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:37,599
Oh, okay.

445
00:29:39,079 --> 00:29:40,359
Whoa.

446
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,440
Is it necessary to cook
this much food?

447
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,079
Only when Mr. Nai's around.

448
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,880
Madame usually restricts us
to only one or two dishes

449
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,160
when he's away.

450
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:53,880
One or two dishes?

451
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:57,440
Huh? Is she that stingy?

452
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,160
Only about some things.

453
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,039
But one thing's for sure.

454
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:04,960
She won't let anyone
take advantage of her.

455
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,160
If she feels like someone

456
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,920
is looking to use her,

457
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:11,839
Mr. Nai, or Ms. Nade
for their benefit,

458
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,079
she'll never let them.

459
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,839
Even Mrs. Da was mistreated.

460
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:20,240
Jai!

461
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,240
Stop!

462
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:28,200
What did she do to Da?

463
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,759
Well...

464
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,079
She...

465
00:30:35,839 --> 00:30:37,799
Ugh, this is difficult!

466
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,039
Please keep it down,
my dear Ms. Nade.

467
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:44,319
Madame is on the phone.
You might get scolded.

468
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:50,200
These are just simple
household expenses.

469
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,720
It's still difficult.

470
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,279
What's the matter, Madame?

471
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,160
Ms. Pensri just called!

472
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,960
Nai bought a necklace
at her shop for his wife

473
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:05,599
to celebrate having a baby boy.

474
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:08,599
How many hundreds of thousands?

475
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:09,799
Thirty thousand!

476
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,440
Mom, it's only 30,000!

477
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,119
You're acting as if it's 300,000
or in the millions.

478
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,880
- Nadedao!
- Calm down, Madame.

479
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,480
I'm sorry.

480
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,759
Don't ever look down
on small amounts of money.

481
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:25,599
You never had to earn money.

482
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:26,839
You don't even know

483
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:30,279
how difficult it is to earn
just a single baht!

484
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:31,920
- Sompit.
- Yes?

485
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:33,279
Has Nai left?

486
00:31:33,359 --> 00:31:35,359
Just now, Madame.

487
00:31:45,599 --> 00:31:46,799
Mother,

488
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,519
is something the matter?

489
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:51,799
- Sompit, take it off.
- Yes, Madame.

490
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,880
- Give it to me!
- Let me go!

491
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,880
- Be gentle. She's pregnant.
- Tom!

492
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,160
Tell me the reason

493
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,240
why you deserve this necklace!

494
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,400
It was a present from Nick, Mother.

495
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,880
A present?

496
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,599
So that everyone knows

497
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,079
you're an easy woman who slept with
my son and got pregnant?

498
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,599
Now you let him work

499
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,920
so that he can buy you gifts.

500
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,119
Once your son is born and learns

501
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,799
about his mom's behavior,

502
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:30,839
he will be very proud.

503
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,400
For the sake of my assurance

504
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:37,920
that you're not here
to leech off of my son,

505
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,480
I'd like to keep this necklace.

506
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:44,720
You have to tell Nai

507
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,599
you lost it!

508
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,920
Understand that, Srikanda?

509
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,359
Do you understand?

510
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:58,279
Yes, Mother.

511
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,559
How could Da let her do that?

512
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,400
Madame Nuan might've
killed her if she didn't.

513
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,640
You still haven't told me

514
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,720
why you asked me
to come here with you.

515
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,880
To sign a contract for your new job.

516
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:16,920
My new job?

517
00:33:19,319 --> 00:33:20,319
What job?

518
00:33:21,079 --> 00:33:22,559
The pitch fell through yesterday.

519
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,640
I still don't have a job
with this company.

520
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,920
Mr. Singkorn would like you
to work on a project.

521
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,920
Didn't I tell you

522
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,440
I want to find a job on my own?

523
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:36,480
I don't want to get one
because I'm your son.

524
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,519
I already let you prove yourself.

525
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,160
In the end,

526
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,720
you were defeated by your own wife.

527
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:51,200
Thai society and connections
go hand-in-hand.

528
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:53,000
People who criticize you

529
00:33:53,079 --> 00:33:54,400
are jealous of you

530
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:57,079
because they weren't born
to be my son like you.

531
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,960
Trust me.

532
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,079
Nepotism has its advantages.

533
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,440
It isn't always a bad thing.

534
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:07,240
How can I teach my son to be honest

535
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:10,159
if I can't even be honest myself?

536
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,289
I've already arranged
an appointment with Mr. Singkorn.

537
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:18,840
You humiliated me yesterday.

538
00:34:19,289 --> 00:34:20,289
And are you going to make me

539
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,719
break my promise today as well?

540
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:31,880
Do my words not mean anything
to you nowadays?

541
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,599
Calm down, Madame.

542
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,400
I think you should wait upstairs.

543
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,920
I'll go and talk to Mr. Nai.

544
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:41,329
Mr. Nai!

545
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:43,599
Please show your mother
some sympathy.

546
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,639
She loves you very much.

547
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,239
If Mom loves me,

548
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,440
then she should
let me live my own life.

549
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,679
Please don't call me nosy.

550
00:34:52,769 --> 00:34:55,039
But you shouldn't be
too egotistical.

551
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:56,960
Think about her feelings sometimes.

552
00:34:57,519 --> 00:34:59,400
She went through a lot

553
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,639
before she could be
where she is today.

554
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,400
Is it wrong

555
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,039
that she doesn't want to see

556
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:09,329
her own children
go through hardships?

557
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:15,639
I think you should try
talking to Mr. Singkorn first

558
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,000
and listen to his ideas.

559
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:18,400
If it doesn't resonate with you,

560
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,639
you don't have to accept the job.

561
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,960
Mr. Nai's here.

562
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:36,079
Hello.

563
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:39,039
Have a seat, Nai.

564
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:44,239
I told you he'd come.

565
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,480
He wouldn't want to be mean
to his dear mom.

566
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:50,599
I heard you don't want
to accept a job from me

567
00:35:50,639 --> 00:35:53,960
because you're worried people
might accuse you of nepotism?

568
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,079
I'm telling you.
There's no need to worry about it.

569
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:01,199
I offered you the job
because you have potential.

570
00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:04,719
It has nothing to do with you
being Madame Nuan's son.

571
00:36:10,809 --> 00:36:13,920
I've never heard anything
about Mrs. Da's necklace.

572
00:36:14,119 --> 00:36:17,519
Why was Madame so cruel to her?
Mrs. Da was such an angel.

573
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,159
Dao,

574
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:30,519
let's not speak ill of the people
in the big house in front of Nick.

575
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:33,639
Even though he doesn't
understand anything now,

576
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,960
it's strictly the adults' business.

577
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,239
I don't want him to grow up
hating his dad's family.

578
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:43,440
They're still related
by blood after all.

579
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,920
Now that you know about how badly
Mrs. Da was treated,

580
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,809
you're not going to
let it slide, are you?

581
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,559
Of course not.

582
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:58,400
(Mr. Singkorn)

583
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,239
Yes, Mr. Singkorn?

584
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,840
You asked to go out
for a meal with me

585
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,039
so that I can give feedback
on your presentation.

586
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,440
When should that be?

587
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,519
And when are you
going to be available?

588
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,079
I'm always
available for you, Ms. Pa.

589
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:19,480
We can go out today if you'd like.

590
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:23,360
Since your husband is out
for lunch with my daughter,

591
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,639
it'll be a while
before he comes home.

592
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:28,719
Come and eat with me
so you won't feel lonely.

593
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,960
So,

594
00:37:30,639 --> 00:37:32,809
Nai is having lunch with Lita?

595
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,880
That's right.

596
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:36,960
Madame Nuan was planning
to be there as well.

597
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:38,920
But then she said
something urgent came up.

598
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,519
I hope you don't have a problem

599
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,880
with your husband going out
with my daughter on his own.

600
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,559
Oh, it's not a problem at all.

601
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:49,639
I'm not that narrow-minded.

602
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:54,119
But I already have
an appointment today.

603
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:55,639
Let's do it another time.

604
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,599
Okay. Bye.

605
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,639
Dao,

606
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:09,039
I know what to do now.

607
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,559
What is it?

608
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,159
Are you still hung up
about accepting Dad's job?

609
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,769
A little bit.

610
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,840
It's only fun
when a desperate woman like you

611
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:35,840
goes up against

612
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:37,360
someone like me.

613
00:38:48,519 --> 00:38:50,679
I'm rooting for you, Nai.

614
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,159
With time, you'll be able to prove
how talented you are

615
00:38:54,289 --> 00:38:55,599
to everyone.

616
00:38:56,239 --> 00:38:57,400
Thank you.

617
00:38:59,329 --> 00:39:00,519
(Pa)

618
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:08,639
Yes, Pa?

619
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,289
I'm out for lunch with Lita.

620
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,480
That's right. Just the two of us.

621
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,960
Where are you at?

622
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:19,360
Audrey Cafe at Zpell.

623
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,329
Why are you asking?

624
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,000
Nothing. Bye.

625
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,039
Are you going out?

626
00:39:28,329 --> 00:39:29,719
- Yes.
- Do you need the car?

627
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:31,809
Trai can drive you.
He's free right now.

628
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,119
It's okay. I already called a ride.

629
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:35,480
- It's not a bother at all...
- It's okay.

630
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,960
The ride's here.

631
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,840
- Are you here to pick me up?
- That's right.

632
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:43,559
Okay, let's go.

633
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:44,679
Put this on, please.

634
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,199
Just a second.

635
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,719
Thank you.

636
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,239
Nai!

637
00:40:04,809 --> 00:40:05,880
Pa?

638
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:08,329
Surprise!

639
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,840
I was in the area when we talked
on the phone just now.

640
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:13,329
So I...

641
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,079
dropped by to see my dear husband.

642
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:18,920
Why are you out of breath?

643
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
Hm?

644
00:40:20,639 --> 00:40:21,809
I don't think so.

645
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,679
By the way,

646
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:25,769
are you done with lunch?

647
00:40:26,329 --> 00:40:27,559
We are.

648
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,840
Oh, what a shame.

649
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,719
I thought I was going to join you.

650
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,519
Nam phrik long ruea
at this place is really good.

651
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,400
They even add eggplants for phonies!

652
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:41,119
Have you ever had it, Lita?

653
00:40:42,199 --> 00:40:43,519
No, I haven't.

654
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,719
I thought you had it often.
That's why...

655
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:53,329
your skin is so smooth
because of the eggplants.

656
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:57,920
If you want to eat something,
I can keep you company.

657
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,719
It's okay.

658
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:02,880
I want you to come with me
to check out some cars.

659
00:41:04,329 --> 00:41:06,039
Can you buy one for me?

660
00:41:07,519 --> 00:41:08,809
You're not scared anymore?

661
00:41:14,719 --> 00:41:17,400
Well, of course I won't be

662
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:19,440
if you're the one who buys it.

663
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:22,289
Please, Nai?

664
00:41:22,519 --> 00:41:24,440
Please take me to buy a car.

665
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:30,679
Oh, come with us, Lita.

666
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,039
I'd rather not.

667
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:36,360
Please don't turn me down.

668
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:40,000
You had lunch with my husband alone.

669
00:41:40,559 --> 00:41:42,440
People might gossip, you know.

670
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:45,289
But if you come with us
to look at cars,

671
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,559
we'll have photographic proof

672
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:49,920
that you're not trying
to steal my husband.

673
00:41:52,559 --> 00:41:53,840
Please?

674
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:58,599
All right.

675
00:42:00,199 --> 00:42:01,840
I'll give you
a lift back here later.

676
00:42:02,329 --> 00:42:04,440
It's more convenient
if I drive myself there.

677
00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:06,440
Don't bail on us, okay?

678
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:09,519
I won't. I always keep my word.

679
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,480
Great.

680
00:42:11,559 --> 00:42:12,920
I'll see you at the showroom.

681
00:42:22,289 --> 00:42:23,769
What are you trying to do?

682
00:42:24,329 --> 00:42:25,769
I'm about to get in the car.

683
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:29,239
If you don't tell me
what you're about to do,

684
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,920
I won't come with you.

685
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,289
And I'm going to head home

686
00:42:34,639 --> 00:42:38,360
to convince Mom and Nade to send
Trai over to spy on us again.

687
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,769
You don't need to threaten me.

688
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:47,239
I'm going to tell you
the truth anyway

689
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:50,440
because you have to cooperate.

690
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:54,639
Do you remember the diamond necklace

691
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:56,840
you bought for Da?

692
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,329
Yes.

693
00:42:59,329 --> 00:43:00,920
She lost it, didn't she?

694
00:43:01,159 --> 00:43:02,840
She didn't.

695
00:43:03,519 --> 00:43:05,480
Madame Nuan took it.

696
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:07,519
To her,

697
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:11,000
Da wasn't worthy enough
to receive any valuables from you.

698
00:43:11,559 --> 00:43:13,199
So she took it

699
00:43:13,289 --> 00:43:16,079
and ordered Da to lie to you
and say she lost it.

700
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:17,920
Who told you this?

701
00:43:18,639 --> 00:43:20,039
You don't have to know.

702
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,199
And you don't have to believe me now

703
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:25,719
because tonight,
I'm going to make her

704
00:43:25,809 --> 00:43:28,079
reveal her true colors to you.

705
00:43:28,559 --> 00:43:29,840
By purchasing a car?

706
00:43:30,199 --> 00:43:31,199
Exactly.

707
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,719
Because to her,

708
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,559
I'm as worthless as Da was.

709
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,559
And how does Lita
have anything to do with this?

710
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,639
I need a spy.

711
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:45,800
So she can report back to Madame.

712
00:43:56,119 --> 00:43:58,239
Lita, what's wrong with your car?

713
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,960
I couldn't get it to start.

714
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:02,119
- I'll have a look at it.
- It's okay.

715
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:04,000
I'll call someone from home
to check it out.

716
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,159
Do you mind if I carpool with you?

717
00:44:06,239 --> 00:44:07,320
Not at all.

718
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:17,960
This model looks interesting too.
It's convenient for city driving.

719
00:44:18,519 --> 00:44:19,599
What do you think, Pa?

720
00:44:20,159 --> 00:44:21,199
I don't think

721
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:23,800
you should be asking me.

722
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:25,960
You should ask my sponsor instead.

723
00:44:28,159 --> 00:44:29,440
What do you think?

724
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,400
Do you think
this one's suitable for me?

725
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,519
It's up to you.

726
00:44:44,039 --> 00:44:47,199
If that's the case, I'm going
to pick an expensive one.

727
00:44:48,320 --> 00:44:49,320
Whichever you like.

728
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:51,440
You're the best.

729
00:44:53,159 --> 00:44:54,679
Let's go with this one.

730
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,800
Nai, if you buy this one,

731
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:04,239
you'll have to take me
out driving often.

732
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,599
Sit inside.

733
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,440
- I'll get that for you.
- Go on. Get in.

734
00:45:11,199 --> 00:45:12,559
Have a seat.

735
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,800
So, what do you think?

736
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,480
Is it comfortable?

737
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:24,239
Hm?

738
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,880
Excuse me.

739
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,880
I have to go to the bathroom.

740
00:45:28,199 --> 00:45:29,280
Go ahead.

741
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,079
Hello?

742
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:45,639
Auntie, are you free to talk?

743
00:45:45,719 --> 00:45:50,480
I need to tell you something
unpleasant about your in-law.

744
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,079
It's your turn now.

745
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:06,159
What else do you want me to do?

746
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:09,159
Call Madame Nuan

747
00:46:09,239 --> 00:46:10,880
and tell her you're not
coming home tonight.

748
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,840
Joy can give me a lift there.

749
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,639
Do it.

750
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,719
I thought you said you were ready
for Madame to show her true colors?

751
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,519
Make it convincing.

752
00:46:32,679 --> 00:46:33,800
(Nai)

753
00:46:36,199 --> 00:46:37,559
Nai's calling.

754
00:46:37,639 --> 00:46:39,719
I have to hang up now, Lita.

755
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:45,079
Hello?

756
00:46:45,159 --> 00:46:46,159
Mom,

757
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:49,440
I just remembered
it's Sit's birthday today.

758
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,920
That's right. His dad's a minister.

759
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,960
I'm thinking of visiting him
and staying for the party.

760
00:46:57,039 --> 00:46:58,840
I might stay the night
at his place as well.

761
00:47:02,599 --> 00:47:03,639
Bye.

762
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:14,960
Madame told me

763
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:17,320
not to let anyone go near the pond

764
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,800
without her permission.

765
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:20,960
What's going on?

766
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:25,159
Servants aren't privy to
their master's business.

767
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,480
Madame told me

768
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:33,119
not to let anyone go near the pond

769
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:35,440
without her permission.

770
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,880
Why not?

771
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,639
Servants aren't privy to
their master's business.

772
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:47,159
The debut model is blue
with a silver roof.

773
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,519
- And...
- Excuse me.

774
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,360
- Yes?
- You can keep talking to him.

775
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:51,719
Yes, of course.

776
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,880
For the car we just looked at, the
body can be red with a black roof.

777
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,880
There are some weird
movements at home.

778
00:47:57,960 --> 00:48:00,639
And these. Pearly white body
with a black roof

779
00:48:00,719 --> 00:48:03,280
or a black body with a silver roof.

780
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,039
If you're interested
in purchasing one today,

781
00:48:06,119 --> 00:48:08,199
I'll give you a special discount.

782
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,119
Thank you so much
for accompanying us, Lita.

783
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,559
But I think I should go
and think about it first.

784
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:18,000
How are you getting home, Lita?

785
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:20,599
I already called a driver
from home to pick me up.

786
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:24,760
Ah. There he is.

787
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,239
Well then. I'll be going now.

788
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,079
Bye.

789
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,840
What about us?
What are we going to do next?

790
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:52,400
Well...

791
00:48:56,639 --> 00:48:57,960
Joy's calling.

792
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,920
Hello, Joy.

793
00:49:01,719 --> 00:49:03,400
Wait out front. I'll walk over.

794
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,960
I have to go.

795
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,000
Okay.

796
00:49:20,199 --> 00:49:22,880
Are you sure you don't want me
to stay with you?

797
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,360
Extremely.

798
00:49:25,639 --> 00:49:27,119
Because if you come along,

799
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:30,000
Madame won't go all out
when she has a go at me.

800
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:33,440
But what if she ends up killing you?

801
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,840
I can't be killed that easily.

802
00:49:36,159 --> 00:49:39,840
I have to stay alive
and avenge Da first.

803
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,800
Look after yourself, okay?

804
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:44,280
Call me once you're done.

805
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,000
Okay.

806
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,960
- Have a safe trip home.
- Sure.

807
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:58,599
Ms. Pa's here.

808
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,280
I really hate her guts, Mom.

809
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:02,840
I just want to slap her silly.

810
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:04,559
Then rip off her clothes

811
00:50:04,639 --> 00:50:07,199
and leave her out front to shame
her publicly for our satisfaction.

812
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:09,599
Don't worry.

813
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,360
You'll certainly
get to be satisfied.

814
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:21,760
Nai,

815
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,920
Pa is my only best friend.

816
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:25,519
Please take care of her for me.

817
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,519
Don't let anything happen to her.

818
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:53,239
What do you want?

819
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,800
Mom wants to see you.

820
00:50:55,239 --> 00:50:56,880
I'd like to go inside
and see Nick's first.

821
00:50:57,039 --> 00:51:00,719
She can come over
if she really wants to see me.

822
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:02,239
Hey!

823
00:51:02,840 --> 00:51:04,599
- Huh?
- Come here!

824
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:05,679
What are you doing?

825
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,199
You won't come in peace,

826
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,880
so I have to resort to violence.

827
00:51:09,079 --> 00:51:11,840
It's payback for what you did.

828
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:13,760
Hey, what are you doing?

829
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:16,440
- Let go of me!
- Bring her along!

830
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:19,000
- Let go!
- Hey!

831
00:51:19,079 --> 00:51:21,639
- What are you doing?
- Walk, now!

832
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,400
Restrain her!

833
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:24,679
- Walk!
- Let me go!

834
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:27,199
- Restrain her!
- Hey!

835
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:31,679
Come on! Hurry up!

836
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:32,800
Keep walking!

837
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,400
Hurry up!

838
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,920
- Ow!
- Ms. Nade!

839
00:51:38,039 --> 00:51:40,119
Get a hold of her!

840
00:51:41,519 --> 00:51:43,119
Where do you think you're going?

841
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:49,360
Do you think you're so tough? Drag
her inside for Mom to deal with.

842
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,039
I can't see!

843
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,119
- Ah!
- Get up the steps!

844
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,039
Move! Go!

845
00:52:02,119 --> 00:52:03,159
Stop squirming!

846
00:52:03,239 --> 00:52:05,119
I can't follow them
in there, Mr. Nai.

847
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:06,760
Or it might look suspicious.

848
00:52:10,199 --> 00:52:12,079
- What's wrong?
- Something shattered,

849
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:13,960
but I don't know what's happening

850
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,800
Ah!

851
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:20,039
Ms. Nade!

852
00:52:20,119 --> 00:52:22,760
Stop squirming! Ms. Nade almost
stepped on the broken lamp!

853
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:26,159
Well, I can't see!
You have me blindfolded!

854
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,400
- Drag her away!
- Yes, ma'am!

855
00:52:28,639 --> 00:52:31,440
- You can just uncover my eyes!
- We can't do that!

856
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:33,159
- Come on!
- Keep moving!

857
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:34,559
- Dao!
- Mr. Nai!

858
00:52:37,719 --> 00:52:39,360
Ugh!

859
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,960
Surprise!

860
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:55,760
Congratulations,
my dear daughter-in-law.

861
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:02,440
Oh, Nai?

862
00:53:02,519 --> 00:53:04,119
I didn't know you'd be here.

863
00:53:04,199 --> 00:53:06,880
I thought you said you were
staying over at your friend's.

864
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,760
I changed my mind.

865
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:10,239
Anyway, join us.

866
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,360
I'm throwing a small party for Pa

867
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,239
to congratulate her for getting
a job with Mr. Singkorn.

868
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:20,159
You've lived up to the reputation
as Madame Nuans's daughter-in-law.

869
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,599
Well done, my dear Pa.

870
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:24,320
Mwah.

871
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:33,880
I'll see you at the showroom.

872
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,199
Things were going so smoothly.

873
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:41,880
Why did she have to show up?

874
00:53:48,599 --> 00:53:49,599
Oh?

875
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:52,719
Oh? What's happening?

876
00:53:56,679 --> 00:53:58,840
Do you remember the diamond
necklace you bought for Da?

877
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,000
Yes.

878
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,480
She lost it, didn't she?

879
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:07,079
She didn't.

880
00:54:07,679 --> 00:54:09,679
Madame Nuan took it.

881
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:14,920
For her, Da wasn't worthy enough
to receive any valuables from you.

882
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:16,639
So she took it

883
00:54:16,719 --> 00:54:19,000
and ordered Da to lie to you
and say she lost it.

884
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:21,719
Who told you this?

885
00:54:22,639 --> 00:54:24,039
You don't have to know.

886
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,760
And you don't have to believe me now

887
00:54:27,320 --> 00:54:28,519
because tonight,

888
00:54:28,679 --> 00:54:32,000
I'm going to make her
reveal her true colors to you.

889
00:54:32,159 --> 00:54:33,480
By purchasing a car?

890
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:34,639
Exactly.

891
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,360
Yes, Lita?

892
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,159
I have something to tell you.

893
00:54:40,239 --> 00:54:42,119
I overheard Pa talking

894
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:46,679
about you taking away
the necklace Nai bought for Da.

895
00:54:47,239 --> 00:54:51,119
That explains why she wanted me
to go and look at cars with them.

896
00:54:51,199 --> 00:54:53,559
She's trying to use me.

897
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:56,760
That's quite evil.

898
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:58,119
You have to repay evil

899
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,199
with evilness.

900
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,039
It'll make you even.

901
00:55:02,519 --> 00:55:04,559
What do you mean?

902
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:08,360
Play along with Pawinee.

903
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,599
Lita, what's wrong with your car?

904
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,480
I couldn't get it to start.

905
00:55:13,559 --> 00:55:14,679
Do you mind if I carpool with you?

906
00:55:15,039 --> 00:55:16,320
Excuse me.

907
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:18,360
I have to go to the bathroom.

908
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:21,079
Auntie, are you free to talk?

909
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:26,360
I need to tell you something
unpleasant about your in-law.

910
00:55:35,079 --> 00:55:36,960
She just fell it.

911
00:55:39,559 --> 00:55:41,360
Nai, come and take a photo together.

912
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,519
Tom, can you take a photo for us?

913
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:50,239
Smile. Smile.

914
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,639
Where are you taking me?

915
00:55:56,719 --> 00:55:58,559
To see a witness.

916
00:55:58,639 --> 00:55:59,800
Mr. Nai.

917
00:56:03,639 --> 00:56:05,079
- Jai.
- Yes?

918
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:10,360
Can you tell him about Madame taking
away the necklace he bought for Da

919
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,039
and how she ordered Da to lie to him
and say she lost it?

920
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,400
You don't have to be afraid.

921
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:24,079
If you get in trouble
for telling the truth,

922
00:56:24,159 --> 00:56:26,039
I'll protect you.

923
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:29,239
Tell him

924
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:31,199
what Madame has done
to Da in the past.

925
00:56:32,519 --> 00:56:33,880
You can speak freely.

926
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:37,760
Madame didn't take
Mrs. Da's necklace away.

927
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:41,800
After I told you about it,

928
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,960
I realized I might've
misunderstood the situation.

929
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,480
Well,

930
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:50,519
Madame went to Mrs. Da
after you gave her the necklace.

931
00:56:50,599 --> 00:56:53,480
She was worried
Mrs. Da might lose it,

932
00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:56,480
so she reminded her to keep it safe.

933
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:58,440
What happened?

934
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,159
Someone forced you
to say that, didn't they?

935
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:04,000
You can just tell me the truth.

936
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:05,760
Oh, it's nothing like that.

937
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,719
I'm telling the truth, Ms. Pa.

938
00:57:08,079 --> 00:57:13,159
Uh, I'm sorry
for the misunderstanding as well.

939
00:57:13,719 --> 00:57:18,360
After living here for a while,
you'll find out I'm forgetful.

940
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:21,000
Please don't mind what I said.

941
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:24,199
I have to go back to work now.

942
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,840
I'm sorry, Ms. Pa.

943
00:57:45,199 --> 00:57:47,760
I heard your father
has coronary artery disease?

944
00:57:49,679 --> 00:57:51,360
I guess that must've cost a fortune.

945
00:57:52,519 --> 00:57:55,840
It does. I have to send over
my entire salary every month.

946
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,360
No harm will come

947
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:01,039
to a grateful person like you.

948
00:58:01,639 --> 00:58:04,719
I heard someone told Pawinee

949
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:08,519
about Srikanda's necklace
being in my possession.

950
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,679
Why are you making that face?

951
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,199
I don't think it's you.

952
00:58:17,960 --> 00:58:20,840
Because someone who's having
financial problems like you

953
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:24,679
wouldn't try to get herself fired.

954
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:28,920
If you know who that person is,

955
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:33,239
tell them

956
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:37,039
to keep their mouth shut
about my business.

957
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,880
And they shouldn't come to me
just to make an excuse

958
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:41,320
but instead think about

959
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:45,920
what they're going to do
to fix this problem.

960
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:55,400
Madame Nuan threw you
a surprise party?

961
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:57,320
I refuse to believe it.

962
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,599
If you'd seen the state
of the party today,

963
00:58:59,679 --> 00:59:01,320
you'd be in even more disbelief.

964
00:59:01,519 --> 00:59:03,599
Jai also told me

965
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,599
everything she said
was a misunderstanding.

966
00:59:06,719 --> 00:59:08,519
She wouldn't discuss
the necklace at all.

967
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:10,079
Pa,

968
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:12,920
can Jai be trusted?

969
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,039
I think so.

970
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:18,199
But I think there must be something.

971
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:20,960
It's like Madame knows
what I'm up to.

972
00:59:21,039 --> 00:59:23,039
But how?

973
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:25,800
I know, right? I don't know either.

974
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:27,840
This sucks, Joy.

975
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,760
I thought Nai was going to see
who she truly is today.

976
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:35,639
Come on. Lady Luck isn't always
on the villain's side.

977
00:59:36,079 --> 00:59:38,960
Pa, I have to go.
Something at work came up.

978
00:59:39,519 --> 00:59:40,519
Okay.

979
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,400
Do you think a brat like you

980
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,960
can do anything to me?

981
00:59:47,320 --> 00:59:49,000
It's not that easy.

982
00:59:50,039 --> 00:59:52,079
Madame,

983
00:59:52,159 --> 00:59:54,960
Mr. Nai is playing with Nick.

984
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:57,360
I told Tang to keep an eye on them.

985
00:59:58,960 --> 01:00:00,840
You're scared he might see us.

986
01:00:01,679 --> 01:00:03,480
Does that mean you're planning
to do something to me?

987
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,119
- Huh?
- Oh!

988
01:00:08,719 --> 01:00:10,599
It's just as you thought, Mom!

989
01:00:10,679 --> 01:00:13,320
She's recording us
so she can show it to Nai later.

990
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,440
Give that back.

991
01:00:14,519 --> 01:00:17,519
I'll give it back
once Mom's finished.

992
01:00:24,239 --> 01:00:26,159
This is Srikanda's necklace.

993
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:31,239
I've been keeping it
with other things

994
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:34,639
your sister leeched off of my son.

995
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:38,679
I'm thinking of selling them

996
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:40,239
and spending the money

997
01:00:40,519 --> 01:00:43,079
on a new toilet here.

998
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:47,800
Oh?

999
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,000
Why are you making that face?

1000
01:00:50,679 --> 01:00:51,960
Are you going to tell Nai?

1001
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,880
Make sure your evidence is solid.

1002
01:00:55,159 --> 01:00:57,519
Otherwise, you'll make a fool of
yourself again like earlier today.

1003
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,039
You all know what I'm about to do.

1004
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:02,800
It confirms my suspicion

1005
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,079
that your congratulating me
was just a lie.

1006
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:09,960
You've finally smartened up.

1007
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,199
You've got the gall

1008
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:15,280
to try and brainwash
my son into hating me.

1009
01:01:17,239 --> 01:01:19,360
I've got the gall to do
even more than that.

1010
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:21,800
You should watch your back.

1011
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:24,079
Go on!

1012
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,960
So I'll have something to show Nai.

1013
01:01:27,719 --> 01:01:28,719
Go ahead and slap me.

1014
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,800
Ooh!

1015
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:35,599
You dared to threaten me?

1016
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:37,320
Don't ever think
I'll be scared of you.

1017
01:01:37,880 --> 01:01:39,119
I raised Nai myself.

1018
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:40,400
Why wouldn't I know

1019
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:43,199
what I should do to convince him
to obey me?

1020
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:44,960
Is that so?

1021
01:01:45,679 --> 01:01:48,480
What about him marrying Da

1022
01:01:48,800 --> 01:01:50,079
and then me?

1023
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:52,880
Apparently, he didn't obey you.

1024
01:01:53,880 --> 01:01:56,039
I actually didn't
want to get in his way

1025
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,960
because I knew Srikanda

1026
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,280
wouldn't be his wife for long.

1027
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:04,360
It's the same as how I know
you're going to meet

1028
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:06,519
the same sticky end
like your sister.

1029
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:09,320
Excuse me,

1030
01:02:09,719 --> 01:02:11,440
but I'm a lot more brazen than her.

1031
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:13,639
Nai and I

1032
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:16,199
are also very much in love.

1033
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:21,800
- Liar!
- You!

1034
01:02:22,760 --> 01:02:23,800
Hey!

1035
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:24,960
Agh!

1036
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:27,239
I think I'm starting to get
to know you more, Pawinee.

1037
01:02:27,400 --> 01:02:28,960
You're a scheming one.

1038
01:02:29,039 --> 01:02:32,119
I know there's something
going on between you and Nai.

1039
01:02:32,599 --> 01:02:34,000
He's not in love with you,

1040
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:36,719
unlike how you and he
are trying to pretend to be.

1041
01:02:36,800 --> 01:02:40,119
And if I find out I'm right,

1042
01:02:40,199 --> 01:02:43,239
I'm going to make him choose
between me, who's his mother,

1043
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:44,440
and you.

1044
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:48,000
I don't think it'd be
a difficult choice for him

1045
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:51,280
because he'd never fall in love
with someone like you.

1046
01:02:51,360 --> 01:02:53,280
He'll never try to defend you.

1047
01:03:09,199 --> 01:03:10,880
Let go!

1048
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:13,199
Here's your phone.

1049
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:22,519
It skipped a bit!

1050
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,400
Splash!

1051
01:03:30,159 --> 01:03:32,320
Ah! Ah!

1052
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:08,679
Where's Mr. Nai?

1053
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,719
You startled me!

1054
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,719
He's upstairs, taking a shower.
He hasn't come down yet.

1055
01:04:14,239 --> 01:04:15,360
Don't worry.

1056
01:04:15,519 --> 01:04:19,960
I won't let him out of my sight,
not even for a second.

1057
01:04:20,239 --> 01:04:21,239
Good job.

1058
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,719
Hi there, Nick.

1059
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,320
Nai,

1060
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:33,000
uh...

1061
01:04:33,559 --> 01:04:35,840
Well, I'd like to...

1062
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:39,119
If you want to apologize
for last night, then it's okay.

1063
01:04:39,360 --> 01:04:40,519
I understand.

1064
01:04:41,079 --> 01:04:43,159
And where are you going?

1065
01:04:43,800 --> 01:04:45,719
Out. I'd like something to drink.

1066
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:48,280
Do you want to come along?

1067
01:04:48,360 --> 01:04:49,360
Of course.

1068
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,360
I'm quite exhausted tonight.

1069
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,440
It'd be so much fun
to drink something cold

1070
01:04:55,519 --> 01:04:57,119
and listen to some nice music.

1071
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,679
I'm sorry I didn't
take you to a bar.

1072
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,119
I was working in the middle
of the sea for so long.

1073
01:05:36,239 --> 01:05:39,000
I've gotten used to looking at
a vast body of water when I'm upset.

1074
01:05:39,079 --> 01:05:41,400
And what are you upset about?

1075
01:05:42,199 --> 01:05:44,480
Pa and I didn't get married
because we were in love.

1076
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:47,079
I knew it.

1077
01:05:47,639 --> 01:05:49,199
We just registered our marriage

1078
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,159
because Pa is angry

1079
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,760
about Mom being the reason
behind Da's death.

1080
01:05:57,239 --> 01:05:58,559
She wants to show me

1081
01:05:59,159 --> 01:06:01,559
how cruel Mom and Nade are
to their daughter-in-law.

1082
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:05,599
And you've witnessed that.

1083
01:06:05,679 --> 01:06:08,159
I didn't expect
Mom would be this bad.

1084
01:06:08,639 --> 01:06:09,960
I feel sorry for Da,

1085
01:06:11,079 --> 01:06:12,119
and I feel bad for Pa as well.

1086
01:06:14,199 --> 01:06:16,320
Pa probably knows
every detail of Da's suffering.

1087
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:19,920
So she sacrificed herself
to be here.

1088
01:06:20,519 --> 01:06:23,280
And when are you
going to tell Ms. Pa

1089
01:06:23,719 --> 01:06:26,079
you know the truth?

1090
01:06:26,639 --> 01:06:28,800
Not now. I can't tell her yet.

1091
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:32,599
We have an agreement

1092
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:36,079
that if I'm sure Mom is
as she's told me,

1093
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:39,280
I'll have to let her have Nick.

1094
01:06:39,360 --> 01:06:40,719
So what are you going to do?

1095
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,800
I'm going to convince Pa and Mom

1096
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,039
accept each other as family.

1097
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:49,559
Let me know

1098
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,280
if you need my help.

1099
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:52,880
But first of all,

1100
01:06:53,559 --> 01:06:55,880
I'd like to make a toast
to wish you luck.

1101
01:07:05,199 --> 01:07:06,519
He's not in love with you,

1102
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:09,199
unlike how you and he
are trying to pretend to be.

1103
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,400
And if I find out I'm right,

1104
01:07:12,840 --> 01:07:15,719
I'm going to make him choose
between me, who's his mother,

1105
01:07:15,960 --> 01:07:16,960
and you.

1106
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:20,519
I don't think it'd be
a difficult choice for him

1107
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,719
because he'd never fall in love
with someone like you.

1108
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:25,599
He'll never try to defend you.

1109
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,039
You have to love me, Nai.

1110
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:56,760
Pa, I bought you a phone.

1111
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:06,280
Pa?

1112
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:07,880
Why did you drink so much?

1113
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,760
I'm going to crush her.

1114
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:44,920
What should we do?

1115
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,000
The son can take responsibility
for his mom's action.

1116
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:48,399
Let your dad stay at my house, Pa.

1117
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,880
Then swim over to the other side.

1118
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,960
Pa, things don't look good.

1119
01:08:55,609 --> 01:08:57,199
I'm going to forget him.

1120
01:08:57,439 --> 01:08:59,569
I'm going to help you forget me.

1121
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:02,880
Woo-hoo!

1122
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:06,119
Prepare yourself
for the consequences

1123
01:09:06,199 --> 01:09:07,529
if you insist on waging a war
against my mom.

1124
01:09:07,609 --> 01:09:09,159
Me?

1125
01:09:09,239 --> 01:09:10,399
Killing my own husband?
