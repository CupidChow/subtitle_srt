1
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,240
I'm going to win Pa's heart...

2
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:40,840
in two days.

3
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,479
All right then.

4
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:43,879
Sign it.

5
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,120
If you can't get Pa to admit
that she loves you

6
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:49,400
by 3 p.m. tomorrow,

7
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,639
you have to divorce her immediately.

8
00:02:57,759 --> 00:02:59,879
Goodnight, Father.

9
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,120
Enjoy your sleep, Nai.

10
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
Goodnight.

11
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,560
Oh? Where's Nai?

12
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,199
I haven't seen him come down.

13
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:34,719
Maybe he's still asleep.

14
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Uncle,

15
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,319
hey.

16
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,759
Hey, Thom.

17
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,719
What brings you here so early?

18
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,639
You told me to come and pick Pa up.

19
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,120
Shush!

20
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,800
Yes, that's right.

21
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,240
I called Thom and asked him
to pick you up for work.

22
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,840
Nai went to bed late,
so he'll probably sleep in today.

23
00:04:07,919 --> 00:04:09,240
Let Thom give you a lift to work

24
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:11,719
so you won't have to wait for Nai.

25
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,400
Breakfast?

26
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:18,610
You two are acting weird.

27
00:04:19,879 --> 00:04:21,279
Is there something going on?

28
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,800
Oh, Thom's probably in a bad mood

29
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,759
because today is the day
that will decide

30
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,800
if he'll have a chance
to be with you.

31
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:31,839
Oh?

32
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,120
Is that true, Thom?

33
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:39,170
Whatever he says.

34
00:04:40,399 --> 00:04:41,519
Oh.

35
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,240
Hey, let's get you to work. Go on.

36
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,480
Or the traffic's
going to be horrible.

37
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,170
I'll tell Nai you've already gone
to work once he's come down.

38
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,480
Go on now.

39
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,120
Oh.

40
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,560
If you're a wimpy guy

41
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,639
who can stand seeing the woman
you love with another guy,

42
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,800
then have it your way.

43
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:17,240
But don't slip up and tell Pa
what I'm up to.

44
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,730
Okay, okay.

45
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,920
I'm fighting back in my own way.

46
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:24,480
Go. Keep an eye out. Go.

47
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,040
- Keep an eye out.
- Got it.

48
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,680
Isn't the ring beautiful?

49
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,120
It is.

50
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:55,720
Whose ring is it?

51
00:05:58,759 --> 00:05:59,759
Yours, of course.

52
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:01,680
Mine?

53
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
Right.

54
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,199
If Nai can't keep his word
to win your heart today,

55
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,839
I'm going to propose to you.

56
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,279
Propose?

57
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,639
Isn't it a little too soon?

58
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,800
How is it too soon?

59
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,160
We've known each other
since our earliest memories.

60
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,199
Let's do it this way.

61
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:31,240
You don't have to
give me an answer yet.

62
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,800
I'm only asking you

63
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,399
to give me a chance

64
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,839
to be your boyfriend.

65
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,399
Madame?

66
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,079
Excuse me, Madame.

67
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,279
Sompit and Tang told me
you refused to get out of bed

68
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,839
or eat anything.

69
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,759
It's already after 11:00 a.m.

70
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,040
I don't have an appetite.

71
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:18,759
Are you sad about Mr. Nai
and Ms. Pawinee?

72
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:32,360
I wasn't going to
let myself be at first,

73
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,639
but I couldn't help it.

74
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:40,199
I raised him so well.

75
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,959
But he ended up belonging
to someone else

76
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,600
who he prefers over his own mother.

77
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,720
So why bother having kids?

78
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:53,519
So your life can have meaning.

79
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,120
I know

80
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,920
you're taking good care of yourself
and your own health

81
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,439
not for your own sake.

82
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,240
You're staying strong
so you can work hard,

83
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,519
earn money, and provide stability
to your children.

84
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:16,079
Are you just going to
give up easily?

85
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,090
That's right.

86
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,840
I have to fight.

87
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,799
I won't give up

88
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,240
to someone who's going to
ruin my son's life.

89
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:56,720
My children have to
spend their lives

90
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,720
only with someone
I deem appropriate.

91
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,480
I can't lose to Pawinee.

92
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,120
Whoa. He's in the exact
same position.

93
00:09:41,759 --> 00:09:42,759
Nai?

94
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,960
Nai?

95
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,210
- Oh, sir?
- Oh.

96
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,279
You're here.

97
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,840
Do you mind keeping an eye
on Nick for a bit?

98
00:10:10,919 --> 00:10:12,240
I'm going downstairs
to clean his bottles.

99
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,720
Oh, of course.

100
00:10:13,799 --> 00:10:15,279
- Thank you.
- Go on.

101
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,000
Oh, is Mr. Nai up?
If he is, I'll heat up his congee.

102
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,159
Not yet.

103
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,000
He's still asleep.

104
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,879
Really?

105
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,519
But he usually doesn't
get up this late.

106
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,679
- Should we check on him?
- There's no need.

107
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:34,159
I heard him working
around 04:00 a.m.

108
00:10:34,330 --> 00:10:36,679
Just let him sleep.

109
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:38,090
Don't disturb a sleeping person.

110
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:40,279
It's a grave sin, you know.

111
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:41,759
All right?

112
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:44,600
- But...
- Hey, it's okay. Trust me.

113
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:52,330
You should see a doctor, sir.

114
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,559
I've been thinking about it.

115
00:10:58,039 --> 00:10:59,720
It's getting more frequent.

116
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,399
You can get back to work.

117
00:11:04,879 --> 00:11:06,000
Okay.

118
00:11:26,159 --> 00:11:27,879
Sleep until this evening.

119
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:35,600
Boo!

120
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,759
Let's get back to our home, okay?

121
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,639
Mr. Nai?

122
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:29,679
Mr. Nai?

123
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:33,840
I'm coming in.

124
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,600
He didn't shower
before going to bed?

125
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:56,919
Grandpa's definitely
up to something.

126
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:01,919
Mr. Nai?

127
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:06,279
Mr. Nai?

128
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:09,159
Mr. Nai?

129
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,519
Is something wrong?

130
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:19,240
No, I'm fine.

131
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,000
When did I fall asleep?

132
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,000
What time is it now?

133
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,840
It's one in the afternoon.

134
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,480
One in the afternoon?

135
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,200
What about Pa? Where is she?

136
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,360
She's been out since morning.

137
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,879
There are only two hours left.

138
00:13:52,279 --> 00:13:53,360
Yes?

139
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,759
Where on earth are you?

140
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I called you hundreds of times.
You didn't pick up.

141
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,799
- I'm sorry. I was asleep.
- Well,

142
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:01,559
aren't you bringing Pa
to that place anymore?

143
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,720
I'm looking forward
to some good news.

144
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,840
Of course I'm going.

145
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:08,240
Huh? But it's already one o'clock.

146
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,679
Are you going to make it in time?

147
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:11,679
Of course. I have to.

148
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,440
My battery's running out.
Can you do me a favor?

149
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,879
Dao, can you help me with something?

150
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:38,960
Yes?

151
00:14:39,039 --> 00:14:40,279
Can you call Pa for me?

152
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
Tell her I'd like her to meet me
at her dad's house.

153
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,440
- I'll catch up with her there.
- Yes, sir.

154
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,799
Please tell Trai and Uncle Phol
to get the car ready for me too.

155
00:14:47,879 --> 00:14:51,519
Of course. But what's going on?
What's with the rush?

156
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
Yes, Dao?

157
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,720
I'll head over now.

158
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:04,360
- Pa.
- Yes?

159
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,120
I've bought you lunch.

160
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,080
Eat up so you'll have
the strength to wait for Nai.

161
00:15:10,559 --> 00:15:12,600
He asked me to go and wait at Dad's.

162
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:14,200
But why?

163
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:16,759
I don't know. He didn't tell me.

164
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,120
I'll give you a lift then.

165
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,519
Okay.

166
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,840
Hang on. Make it straight first.

167
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,039
- Okay. All done.
- Is it tight?

168
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,320
- It is, isn't it?
- You're here.

169
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:28,960
Hey, hey.

170
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:32,320
Get Mr. Nai's car ready now.

171
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,639
He's going over to see Ms. Pa.

172
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,080
What's the matter?

173
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:37,120
He struck a deal with Grandpa.

174
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,919
He has to make her admit
her love for him by 3 p.m.

175
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,080
If not, they have to get a divorce.

176
00:15:42,159 --> 00:15:43,840
- Huh?
- I don't know why of all days,

177
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,240
he chose today to sleep in!

178
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,720
Maybe he overslept
because of Grandpa.

179
00:15:48,799 --> 00:15:51,360
Whatever. Go and get the car ready.

180
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,320
- Do it now.
- Get the car, Uncle.

181
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,240
Hey, Dao. Hold up.

182
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:01,879
What's going on?

183
00:16:13,879 --> 00:16:16,960
Sathu. I hope Mr. Nai can
keep his side of the promise.

184
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,159
I've been shipping them for ages.
I hope they can be together.

185
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,519
What is Nai about to do?

186
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,759
I asked you what Nai is about to do.

187
00:16:36,279 --> 00:16:37,720
- Dao.
- Yes?

188
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,879
He promised Mr. Pinit

189
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,399
he'll get Ms. Pa
to say she loves him

190
00:16:43,799 --> 00:16:45,840
by 03:00 p.m. today.

191
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:48,440
If not, he'll have to
divorce her immediately.

192
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:53,879
It's Mr. Nai.

193
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:02,080
Dao, why did you tell her?

194
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,759
Well, why did you mention him?

195
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,680
I just said his name.

196
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,200
But you spilled all the beans.

197
00:17:07,279 --> 00:17:08,519
Ah.

198
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,039
Hey, let's go and find out
what's going to happen.

199
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,000
Please convince Ms. Pa
to stay with us.

200
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,519
You knew?

201
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:22,170
- Dao told us.
- Good luck, Mr. Nai.

202
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,079
Thank you.

203
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:26,200
Nai.

204
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,480
Mom!

205
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,170
- Madame?
- Madame!

206
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,720
It hurts.

207
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:45,920
What happened, Madame?

208
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,799
She slipped and fell over.

209
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,799
Tom, please call an ambulance.

210
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:53,480
Don't, Nai. I don't want to wait.

211
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:56,319
You drive me to the hospital, okay?

212
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,279
But you shouldn't move

213
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,720
in case there are broken bones.

214
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:00,920
I don't think so.

215
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:02,759
Only my ankle's hurting.

216
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,200
Which one?

217
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:06,890
Just the right one. Please?

218
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:09,039
Can you get up?

219
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,039
Be careful, Mom.

220
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:17,200
Take it slow.

221
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,200
Trai, open the car door.
I'm taking Mom to the hospital.

222
00:18:20,279 --> 00:18:21,799
- Yes, sir.
- I'll get it.

223
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:24,039
Mr. Nai,

224
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:25,440
I can drive Madame for you.

225
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:30,200
- Mom.
- Step down.

226
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,119
It hurts.

227
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,519
I should take her.

228
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,000
I'll drive you then.

229
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,920
Mr. Nai, can I come along as well?

230
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,119
Take it slow.

231
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,799
Take it slow, Mom.

232
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,000
Take it easy, Madame.

233
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:51,170
I guess it must be very painful.

234
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:52,799
Watch your step.

235
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:55,319
Be careful.

236
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:03,839
Trai, drive.

237
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,839
- Dao.
- Yes?

238
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:16,039
Do you reckon Madame's faking it?

239
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:18,279
Obviously.

240
00:19:18,359 --> 00:19:21,650
She wants Mr. Nai to be late
so that they break up.

241
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:22,720
I know, right?

242
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:25,559
Hey.

243
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:27,440
- Wait.
- What?

244
00:19:27,519 --> 00:19:28,559
- Break up?
- Break up?

245
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,680
Why do they have to break up?

246
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:34,319
Right? And where's Ms. Pa?
Why does he have to go and meet her?

247
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,559
Busybodies!

248
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,000
Tell us now.

249
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,200
If you don't,

250
00:19:40,519 --> 00:19:42,319
I'm going to tell Madame

251
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,079
you accused her of being a liar,

252
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:48,480
pretending to fall down the stairs
to get Mr. Nai's attention.

253
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,170
- Are you crazy? I didn't say that.
- You did.

254
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,720
- Did not.
- Did too.

255
00:19:53,799 --> 00:19:55,170
What good hears you have.

256
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,170
- I said I didn't.
- You did.

257
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,559
Tell us now if you don't
want to get in trouble.

258
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:03,240
Not a chance!

259
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,410
- Tell us now.
- I said I won't.

260
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,119
Out of the way.

261
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,240
- Hey.
- What?

262
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:12,079
- You dared to push me?
- So what if I did?

263
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:15,170
Ah, you slapped each other.

264
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,240
- Come here.
- What?

265
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,410
- Ow.
- Come here.

266
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,440
What's going on?

267
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:29,480
Oh, dear. What are you doing?

268
00:20:29,599 --> 00:20:31,119
Stop!

269
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,279
That's enough.

270
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,720
Stop.

271
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:35,200
You live under the same roof.

272
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,200
What? You want a piece of me?

273
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,279
Mom had an accident.

274
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,559
I'm taking her to the hospital.

275
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:47,119
I'll meet you at the agreed time
as soon as we're done.

276
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:50,599
Thom,

277
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,039
Nai just texted me.

278
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,480
He said Madame had an accident.

279
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:58,759
What a coincidence.

280
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,759
Do you think she's faking it?

281
00:21:04,839 --> 00:21:05,960
Forget it, Thom.

282
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,839
I don't have evidence,
and I don't want to frame anyone.

283
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,650
- Pa.
- Yes?

284
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,759
If you marry me,

285
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:17,960
you won't have to worry
about your in-laws.

286
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,410
Ow...

287
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,200
- There!
- Stop.

288
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:47,410
Stop this instance!

289
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:51,160
Get up.

290
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,160
Get up from there.

291
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
What's all the racket?

292
00:22:01,079 --> 00:22:02,400
Hey!

293
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,559
Ms. Nade.

294
00:22:13,119 --> 00:22:14,200
Just you wait.

295
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,640
If I don't get my 12 hours of sleep
and get wrinkles on my face,

296
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,160
I'm going to dock
all of your salaries.

297
00:22:21,519 --> 00:22:22,759
Madame fell off the stairs.

298
00:22:22,839 --> 00:22:25,599
Mr. Nai's driving her to
the hospital right now.

299
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:29,319
Is Mom all right?

300
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,240
I heard she injured her ankle.

301
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,680
Why didn't anyone wake me up?

302
00:22:35,759 --> 00:22:37,359
We're about to

303
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,079
but were too busy dealing
with these jackals.

304
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,480
Exactly. They accused Madame of
pretending to fall off the stairs

305
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,839
to stall Mr. Nai
from meeting Ms. Pa.

306
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:46,880
That's right!

307
00:22:48,839 --> 00:22:50,559
Tell me what happened.

308
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,559
When Madame fell off the stairs...

309
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,519
I'm asking Dao and Jai.

310
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,799
So?

311
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:10,880
Mom knows about you
going to meet Pawinee.

312
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,759
I'm sure she pretended to fall off
the stairs to prevent you

313
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:17,599
from meeting her in time.

314
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,039
But I saw her fall with my own eyes.

315
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:30,440
She's done worse
than falling down the stairs before.

316
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,680
Do you remember when
Srikanda went into labor

317
00:23:32,759 --> 00:23:34,720
and Mom fell from
the second-floor balcony?

318
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:37,480
You didn't get to be with
Srikanda when she gave birth.

319
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,200
- Take it slow.
- Mrs. Da.

320
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,519
I'll help you carry that.

321
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,799
Dao, Jai, I'm about to get
to see my baby's face.

322
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,200
You must be excited.

323
00:23:50,319 --> 00:23:51,720
I really am. Let's go.

324
00:23:54,519 --> 00:23:55,559
Mom!

325
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:05,480
She'd been growing the bush
at that spot for months

326
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,640
so it would soften her fall.

327
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:10,319
And that wasn't a one-time thing.

328
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,640
Where are you taking me?

329
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:18,319
You can't take off the blindfold
unless I tell you to.

330
00:24:19,119 --> 00:24:20,480
Oops, we're here.

331
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:23,119
Okay. Are you ready?

332
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,640
Yes.

333
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,240
One, two...

334
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,599
Nai, what are you playing at?

335
00:24:31,359 --> 00:24:33,119
Okay, okay.
I'll be serious this time.

336
00:24:34,519 --> 00:24:38,440
One, two, three.

337
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,559
That's Mother's voice.

338
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,799
Nai!

339
00:24:45,799 --> 00:24:47,319
Mom fell into the water!

340
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,240
Mom slipped and fell into the water!

341
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,240
What are you saying?

342
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,000
Nai!

343
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,440
Mom slipped and fell into the pool!

344
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:58,720
- Come on. Go and help her.
- I'll be back, Da.

345
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:12,319
Are you going for dinner
to celebrate Valentine's?

346
00:25:13,319 --> 00:25:14,319
Yes, Mom.

347
00:25:14,599 --> 00:25:16,319
I'm taking Da out to relax

348
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,720
in case we can give Nick
a younger sibling tonight.

349
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:23,640
We have to go now.

350
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,359
Bye.

351
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,480
Where should we go?

352
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,880
- Hey!
- What?

353
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,279
- Mom!
- What is this? Let go of me!

354
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,799
Let me go!

355
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,839
Mom!

356
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:57,880
Mom.

357
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
Nai.

358
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:04,200
They said they kidnapped
the wrong person,

359
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,960
so they pushed me out of the car.

360
00:26:06,519 --> 00:26:08,519
I'm scared, Nai. I'm scared.

361
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,640
She was willing to do anything

362
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,880
to stop you from spending
quality time with Srikanda.

363
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,279
So Srikanda would feel lonely

364
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,759
to the point she'd reach her limit

365
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,400
and break up with you.

366
00:26:31,519 --> 00:26:32,960
Who are you chatting to?

367
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:36,440
Oh, it's Nade.

368
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:38,680
She asked me to
take good care of you.

369
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,839
Does your left ankle still hurt?

370
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,279
Yes, of course.

371
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:57,759
See?

372
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,160
It's so painful.

373
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,799
Which one?

374
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,279
Just the right one. Please?

375
00:27:07,519 --> 00:27:08,680
But back home,

376
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,960
you said only the right one
was hurting.

377
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:14,559
But you're holding on to your left.

378
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:18,960
The left one's starting to hurt too.

379
00:27:19,319 --> 00:27:21,799
Both of them are hurting right now.

380
00:27:24,839 --> 00:27:25,839
I see.

381
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:39,480
I'm sure now she's lying.

382
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,880
Trai,

383
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:45,559
drive faster.

384
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,079
I want Mom to reach the hospital
as soon as possible.

385
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,480
Right on.

386
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,359
Thom, pull over to the right here.

387
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,160
They're here.

388
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,640
- Hello, Auntie Orn.
- Hello.

389
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,319
I was just checking on the rest
of the kitchen repair work.

390
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,079
Then Joy called and told me

391
00:28:30,319 --> 00:28:32,119
you'd be waiting for Nai here.

392
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:34,000
So I told the workers
to finish for the day.

393
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:37,160
So, you know Nai's going to...

394
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,880
Of course.

395
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,720
Joy told me everything.

396
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,440
Have you had anything yet?

397
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:45,640
I made soup
with banana flowers today.

398
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:49,200
- Oh.
- I don't think Pa has an appetite.

399
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:51,839
Pa,

400
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,359
you still have to eat
something regardless.

401
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,559
Because once Nai arrives,

402
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:58,920
your heart will race.

403
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,400
You might even faint.

404
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:03,960
Or if you're disappointed, you'll
have the strength to keep going.

405
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,359
Oh, you.

406
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,039
Let's go inside and wait.

407
00:29:08,119 --> 00:29:10,400
I'll bring out the soup,
and we can eat together.

408
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,720
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

409
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,720
You're welcome.

410
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,759
- I'll escort her myself.
- Okay.

411
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:38,359
Excuse me.

412
00:29:49,839 --> 00:29:51,039
Hello, Madame.

413
00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:52,720
Let's discuss
the details over there.

414
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:00,759
Nai, what's wrong?

415
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:02,400
Is something bothering you?

416
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,440
Did I waste your time?

417
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,599
Well then.

418
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,279
You can go.

419
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,119
I can stay with Tom.

420
00:30:10,759 --> 00:30:11,960
I won't abandon you, Mom.

421
00:30:12,759 --> 00:30:14,039
Please wheel her in.

422
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,680
The doctor will be
seeing you in a bit.

423
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,160
Nai,

424
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,599
can I borrow your phone?
I'd like to talk to a client.

425
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,640
You can use mine, Madame.

426
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,240
Oh.

427
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,440
Oh, dear. The battery ran out.

428
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,480
Here.

429
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,039
Nai, can you confirm with the nurse?

430
00:30:52,079 --> 00:30:56,519
I'll only see
my personal doctor, Dr. Tawee.

431
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,680
Sure. I'll let them know.

432
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:10,119
Madame, what are you thinking?

433
00:31:11,839 --> 00:31:13,759
Since Nai's been texting with Nade,

434
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,759
he seems to have changed.

435
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,319
I want to know
what they were talking about.

436
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:26,440
(Nade)

437
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,000
Oh? Why aren't there any messages?

438
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,839
How is that possible?

439
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:40,240
I'm sure now she's lying.

440
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,160
Don't text me anything else.

441
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:45,079
I'm deleting the messages

442
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,720
in case Mom tries to read them.

443
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,759
(Delete)

444
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,480
The doctor's on the way.

445
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,359
How did it go? Have you finished
talking to your client?

446
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,880
All done.

447
00:32:13,359 --> 00:32:15,559
Tom, please take care of her.

448
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,160
Please call me right away
if there's anything.

449
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,519
Where are you going, Nai?

450
00:32:20,359 --> 00:32:21,440
I'm going to meet Pa.

451
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,279
I thought you said you weren't
going to abandon me.

452
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,039
I didn't.

453
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,880
I took you to the hospital.

454
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,720
You're with the doctor now.

455
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:34,079
But can you keep me company?

456
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,400
I don't know
how my ankles are doing.

457
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,519
My head also hit the floor

458
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,799
when I fell over.

459
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:45,119
The doctor might tell me
to get a CT scan.

460
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,319
You know I'm claustrophobic.

461
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,519
If I have to be inside
the scanner alone,

462
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:54,519
I need your moral support.

463
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,720
Stay with me okay?

464
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,359
I need my son's support.

465
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:14,920
I'm here.

466
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,000
I'll provide you support, Mom.

467
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,920
Because I have tons of it.

468
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,319
It's not the same.

469
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,240
How? I'm your kid too.

470
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,599
Why are you so early?

471
00:33:34,319 --> 00:33:36,240
I rushed over
as soon as I heard the news.

472
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:37,759
You should go.

473
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,720
I'll take care of Mom.

474
00:33:40,039 --> 00:33:41,240
Thanks.

475
00:33:43,079 --> 00:33:44,480
Nai...

476
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,759
- Nai. Nai...
- Mom,

477
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,799
please don't try and stop him.

478
00:33:49,599 --> 00:33:52,599
The more you try, the worse
he'll think of you.

479
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,519
What did you tell him?

480
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,759
I told him what I should have.

481
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,279
I feel sorry for him.

482
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,039
I want him to be happy
with the person he loves.

483
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:15,840
Are you okay, Ms. Nade?

484
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,289
Nai?

485
00:34:26,769 --> 00:34:28,159
Nai?

486
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:32,809
That's right.

487
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:36,119
I want you to break up with Pawinee.

488
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,239
That woman

489
00:34:38,329 --> 00:34:40,599
isn't suitable
to be your life partner.

490
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,920
She tricked you into loving her.

491
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,960
And one day,

492
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,519
she's going to leave you

493
00:34:52,039 --> 00:34:55,519
and take all of your inheritance
with her

494
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:58,639
to avenge her sister
and get back at me.

495
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,840
You don't know her.

496
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,289
And do you really think
you know her well enough?

497
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,679
You haven't known
each other for that long.

498
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,960
How can you be sure

499
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:13,559
she truly loves you?

500
00:35:17,199 --> 00:35:18,239
For certain things,

501
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:21,360
time isn't important.

502
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,119
I've spent my whole life with you,

503
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,920
and I don't even know the real you.

504
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,519
Nai.

505
00:35:38,159 --> 00:35:39,960
Nai.

506
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:43,809
If you leave,

507
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,840
then we're not
mother and son anymore.

508
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,599
Between the woman
who does a stupid thing,

509
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:06,599
marrying the husband
of her own sister

510
00:36:06,719 --> 00:36:08,039
to take revenge on your mother,

511
00:36:09,159 --> 00:36:10,199
and me,

512
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,920
who willingly sacrificed so much

513
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,440
so you can live a good life,

514
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,769
who do you choose?

515
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,289
If you choose her,

516
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:31,289
then go.

517
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:35,400
And don't call me

518
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,599
your mother again.

519
00:37:21,809 --> 00:37:22,809
Nai.

520
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,639
Nai.

521
00:37:51,159 --> 00:37:53,159
Do you know what your mistake was?

522
00:37:56,809 --> 00:37:58,239
When you demanded

523
00:37:59,239 --> 00:38:00,880
that he choose.

524
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,679
He didn't want to choose anyone.

525
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:08,289
He just wants the people
he loves to be together.

526
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:11,440
But since you forced him,

527
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,360
he had to choose the person
he's happy with

528
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,159
and that person's not you.

529
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:25,329
Please stop forcing us
to do things we don't want to.

530
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,880
All of us can read you
like a book now.

531
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:42,400
(Mr. Frank)

532
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,920
Is it Mr. Frank?

533
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,599
Yes, it's him.

534
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,199
Madame Nuan speaking.

535
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,960
You've found him?

536
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,639
I'll be there now.

537
00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:05,400
Mom?

538
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,880
Where are you
taking my car key? Mom.

539
00:39:17,809 --> 00:39:18,920
Hello.

540
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,239
Coming.

541
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,480
- Hello.
- Oh, it's you two again.

542
00:39:24,559 --> 00:39:27,199
We're here to pick
your husband up to meet someone.

543
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,239
Mr. Nai, I've looked it up
on the map.

544
00:39:39,329 --> 00:39:42,840
There was an accident on the tollway
to Ms. Pa's house.

545
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:44,599
It's faster if you
use the main road,

546
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:46,880
then merge onto Rama 8.

547
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,239
Thanks very much.

548
00:39:49,519 --> 00:39:50,519
Wait.

549
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:54,679
I'm speaking on behalf of
the workers at Madame's house.

550
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,679
The others would like to ask you
not to break up with Ms. Pa.

551
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,519
That will never happen.

552
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,840
Hang in there, Mr. Nai.

553
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,840
Good luck.

554
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,880
Here. Try this.

555
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,809
Go on. Eat up, Thom.

556
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,920
- Eat up.
- This is my favorite.

557
00:40:31,559 --> 00:40:32,880
What do you think? Is it good?

558
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,360
Then eat your fill, all right?

559
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:40,840
Try that one.

560
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,360
A car will be here
in a bit, Ms. Nade.

561
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:02,679
Hello, Trai.

562
00:41:02,769 --> 00:41:04,000
Hello, Ms. Nade.

563
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:06,239
I took Madame
and Mr. Nai to the hospital.

564
00:41:07,809 --> 00:41:09,329
I'm also at the hospital.

565
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,920
Where are you now?

566
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,769
I'm outside.

567
00:41:13,519 --> 00:41:15,440
I'll go out and meet you there.

568
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:17,289
Okay.

569
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,289
Tom, you can keep waiting
for Uncle Phol.

570
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,039
I'm going with Trai.

571
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:27,360
Oh?

572
00:41:27,769 --> 00:41:29,199
And where are you going?

573
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,079
I can't tell you.

574
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,000
It's up to where
our hearts bring us.

575
00:41:39,239 --> 00:41:40,440
She's a lost cause.

576
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:59,960
You're sleeping so soundly.

577
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:02,920
Everything seems
to be going fine for you.

578
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,639
There's only one downside.
You resemble your dad too much.

579
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,440
Dad?

580
00:42:19,199 --> 00:42:21,400
Dao, over here.

581
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,480
Come on.

582
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,920
Uncle, Nai asked Pa
to meet at your house.

583
00:42:42,289 --> 00:42:44,119
And he's on the way now.

584
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:46,119
Why does it have to be at my place?

585
00:42:46,809 --> 00:42:48,329
Did he tell you
what he's planning to do?

586
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,769
No, he didn't.

587
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:51,039
I should head over there too.

588
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:52,880
There's no need, Uncle.

589
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,809
It's almost three o'clock.

590
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:58,289
I think you should wait there
for the good news.

591
00:42:58,599 --> 00:42:59,809
All right.

592
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,239
You have to take care
of this for me then, Thom.

593
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:05,880
Everything has to stop
when the clock strikes three.

594
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,079
Understood?

595
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,719
Okay, Uncle. I have to go now.

596
00:43:33,769 --> 00:43:34,960
Da.

597
00:43:36,329 --> 00:43:40,199
Please help to stop Nai
from winning your sister's heart.

598
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,400
Kee, I have three kilos to go
before I reach Pa's dad's.

599
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:06,039
Okay.

600
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:14,840
Hello, Madame Nuan. I'm Poom.

601
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,320
I oversee the Thai branch of Spy 33.

602
00:46:17,519 --> 00:46:20,800
So where's the person who claimed
to know my daughter-in-law's secret?

603
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,679
Please have a seat
and wait for a moment.

604
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:54,719
Pa.

605
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,519
Pa.

606
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,920
Huh?

607
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:05,199
What happened, Nai?

608
00:47:06,519 --> 00:47:08,880
Don't say running over is
your attempt to win Pa's heart.

609
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,079
No,

610
00:47:12,039 --> 00:47:13,840
but I want you to meet someone.

611
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,400
Who?

612
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,400
Excuse me, sir.

613
00:47:47,679 --> 00:47:48,760
Hello.

614
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:54,440
She has a lead
on Ms. Pawinee's secret.

615
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,280
I'm sorry for making
you come out here.

616
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:09,239
It's not a problem at all.

617
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,880
It's good for Dum
to get out sometimes.

618
00:48:13,639 --> 00:48:15,760
He's been stuck at home
for many years.

619
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:17,039
It's a bit uncomfortable.

620
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:22,599
Who are they?

621
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,159
This is Dumkerng,

622
00:48:30,039 --> 00:48:31,639
the person you've been
searching for.

623
00:48:58,320 --> 00:48:59,559
Dumkerng?

624
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:03,760
You're not dead.

625
00:49:05,559 --> 00:49:07,880
You're not dead. You're still alive.

626
00:49:10,159 --> 00:49:12,119
The guy Pa's been looking for?

627
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,599
Dumkerng.

628
00:49:34,519 --> 00:49:35,599
Dumkerng.

629
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,320
His wife said the night
he was hit by your car,

630
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:46,800
he only sustained minor injuries.

631
00:49:49,519 --> 00:49:50,519
And...

632
00:49:51,039 --> 00:49:53,320
And what about the blood
on the road?

633
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,199
Oh, that was chicken blood.

634
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,599
- Sorry?
- It was chicken blood.

635
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,880
Chicken blood?

636
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,880
Oh?

637
00:50:14,239 --> 00:50:16,000
Whenever Dum was drunk,

638
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,000
he always stole things.

639
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:22,280
That day, he grabbed a bag of
chicken blood from the market.

640
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,000
After he managed to steal it,

641
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:26,559
he recklessly ran away

642
00:50:26,639 --> 00:50:28,159
and got hit by your car.

643
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:30,119
But he wasn't really hurt.

644
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,400
He was only scared

645
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,599
he'd get caught stealing

646
00:50:35,559 --> 00:50:38,039
so he ran away.

647
00:50:40,199 --> 00:50:41,199
Excuse me,

648
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:44,639
but how come he's unwell now?

649
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,840
He drank a lot

650
00:50:47,239 --> 00:50:49,119
and suffered a stroke.

651
00:50:49,519 --> 00:50:51,239
It has nothing to do
with the accident.

652
00:50:53,159 --> 00:50:55,639
And where did you find him?

653
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:58,280
I have a friend who owns
a hospital in this area.

654
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,320
So I asked him to look up
a list of patients

655
00:51:02,719 --> 00:51:04,960
in an accident that day.

656
00:51:05,519 --> 00:51:07,679
We're lucky
he went to that hospital.

657
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:19,119
I'm sorry

658
00:51:20,719 --> 00:51:23,800
for being reckless that day.
I hit you

659
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,960
and drove away.

660
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,079
I'm sorry.

661
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,760
There's no need to
overthink it anymore, dear.

662
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,519
Excuse me.

663
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:42,119
Come here, you.

664
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:47,639
Tell me what happened.

665
00:52:47,639 --> 00:52:49,440
When did Pa hit him?

666
00:52:49,519 --> 00:52:51,519
Ages ago.

667
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:54,440
It was when she was in high school.

668
00:52:55,039 --> 00:52:56,440
Does Nit know about this?

669
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,559
No, he doesn't.

670
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,280
Pa meant to tell him,

671
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,639
but then she decided not to

672
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:06,960
since he has heart problems.

673
00:53:07,039 --> 00:53:08,599
Good thing she didn't.

674
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,119
Nit's always so dramatic
and over the top.

675
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:21,559
Oh.

676
00:53:22,119 --> 00:53:23,519
Speak of the devil.

677
00:53:24,119 --> 00:53:27,239
I guess he's calling
to ask about Nai.

678
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,679
Talk to him.
I need to get something.

679
00:53:29,719 --> 00:53:30,719
Okay.

680
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,000
Yes, Uncle?

681
00:53:37,079 --> 00:53:40,239
I called you many times.
Why didn't you pick up?

682
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,800
Things were a little bit hectic.

683
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:46,599
So,

684
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,639
between us and Nai,

685
00:53:50,159 --> 00:53:51,159
who won?

686
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:57,760
We lost, Uncle.

687
00:53:58,320 --> 00:53:59,320
Lost?

688
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,239
How come?

689
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,199
What did he do to win Pa's heart?

690
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:07,480
- Mr. Nai did it.
- Thom?

691
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:12,039
- Continue the conversation at home.
- Okay.

692
00:54:14,119 --> 00:54:15,159
Can you hear me?

693
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:17,119
Hey.

694
00:54:17,199 --> 00:54:18,559
Come on, Uncle.

695
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,360
If two people are going
to fall in love,

696
00:54:20,519 --> 00:54:22,679
it's going to happen
even they just blink.

697
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,679
What are you on about?

698
00:54:25,239 --> 00:54:28,000
It's not surprising
we don't understand.

699
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,880
No one can understand
the love between two people

700
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:33,400
except for those people themselves.

701
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,159
What are you talking about?

702
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:37,280
Uncle,

703
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:41,639
it's time for us to accept reality
and move on.

704
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:45,320
I'm sorry, but I only
know roll-on, the deodorant.

705
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,039
I don't know anything
about moving on.

706
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,880
Sir!

707
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:00,599
What's wrong? Sir!

708
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,440
Does it hurt?

709
00:55:05,159 --> 00:55:07,280
Are you okay? Let's get you a seat.

710
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:08,719
I'll help you.

711
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:42,119
How did it go, Madame? Have you
found out Ms. Pa's secret?

712
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,039
Did you find out anything?

713
00:55:50,119 --> 00:55:51,280
Nothing.

714
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,559
The person Mr. Poom brought over

715
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:56,079
was Pawinee's roommate
when she was studying in the UK.

716
00:55:56,519 --> 00:56:00,639
She said Pawinee always talked
in her sleep about killing someone.

717
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:01,760
Killing someone?

718
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,079
I guess that's a good lead then.

719
00:56:05,639 --> 00:56:07,039
She was just talking in her sleep.

720
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:08,880
How could I have
her arrested for that?

721
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:13,800
Did you ask them to keep looking?
Or have you given up?

722
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:16,039
The former, of course.

723
00:56:16,679 --> 00:56:18,599
She dared to manipulate Nai

724
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,199
into severing ties with me.

725
00:56:21,719 --> 00:56:24,840
I have to find a way to
get back at her.

726
00:56:42,639 --> 00:56:44,320
You still don't look too well.

727
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:45,760
Would you like to see a doctor?

728
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,119
No.

729
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:49,440
I'll just rest for a bit.

730
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:52,199
But if I don't feel
any better afterward, I'll go.

731
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,800
Then please get some rest.

732
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,800
Clear your mind,

733
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:05,199
and don't overthink
about Ms. Pa, okay?

734
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,760
Okay.

735
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:16,719
I don't want to gossip
about my boss or anything.

736
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,719
But I don't want you
to turn out to be like Madame Nuan.

737
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,280
How?

738
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,639
Well,

739
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:30,320
being in control
of your children's lives.

740
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,840
Mr. Tom just came back and told me

741
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,079
Mr. Nai was going over
to meet Ms. Pa.

742
00:57:36,159 --> 00:57:40,039
Madame got angry and declared
to sever ties with him,

743
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,280
and he let her.

744
00:57:43,199 --> 00:57:44,239
Whoa.

745
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:46,800
Nai did?

746
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:49,719
He dared to defy his mother?

747
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,480
There are limits
to people's patience.

748
00:57:54,639 --> 00:57:57,000
I don't want you to do something

749
00:57:57,239 --> 00:58:00,119
to wear out Ms. Pa's patience.

750
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,280
It's better to
understand each other,

751
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,519
accept each other's decisions,

752
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:07,039
and live in harmony.

753
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,480
You've got a way with your words.

754
00:58:19,039 --> 00:58:22,400
Why do you think I was chosen
to look after Nick?

755
00:58:25,039 --> 00:58:26,119
Get some rest.

756
00:58:45,079 --> 00:58:47,119
Do I really have to accept it?

757
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,159
- And then...
- Everyone.

758
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,400
What? What?

759
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:57,440
- I have good news.
- What is it?

760
00:58:57,559 --> 00:58:59,840
Mr. Nai succeeded.

761
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:05,840
- Oh.
- I can't believe it.

762
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:09,039
I'm so happy.

763
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:23,599
What was it, Ms. Nade?

764
00:59:24,639 --> 00:59:26,280
Jai called and told me

765
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,599
Nai did it.

766
00:59:28,679 --> 00:59:29,920
Really?

767
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,599
Finally, Mr. Nai.

768
00:59:32,679 --> 00:59:34,719
I can't believe I'm happy

769
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:37,559
Pawinee's still my sister-in-law.

770
00:59:38,039 --> 00:59:40,239
It's because you know her more now.

771
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:42,320
And you realize
she's a lovely person.

772
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,719
Let's keep eating.

773
00:59:48,679 --> 00:59:50,880
What do you want? Pork?

774
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:52,280
Oh, it's okay.

775
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:54,039
- No touching.
- Why not?

776
00:59:54,119 --> 00:59:55,440
Because I'm going to serve you.

777
00:59:58,400 --> 00:59:59,480
Sticky rice?

778
00:59:59,559 --> 01:00:02,519
This is so like "Kimi No Toriko."

779
01:00:06,280 --> 01:00:07,360
Goodbye.

780
01:00:12,119 --> 01:00:14,599
Are you sure you don't want me
to come back and pick you up?

781
01:00:14,679 --> 01:00:17,360
Oh, I already called the shop
to pick up the car.

782
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,639
- All right. See you later.
- Bye.

783
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:20,719
- Bye.
- Bye.

784
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:35,599
Is Nai's friend gone?

785
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,400
Yes, Auntie Orn.

786
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,400
And he'll drop those two
at their house.

787
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:41,679
That's good.

788
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:44,000
Visit them sometimes
if you have time.

789
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,280
Okay, Auntie.

790
01:00:45,719 --> 01:00:48,039
And where's Thom?

791
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:49,920
He left.

792
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,440
Huh? He left?

793
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,719
Why didn't he wait for me?

794
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:57,760
It's because he knows

795
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,840
you're in love with Nai.

796
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:17,960
Thank you.

797
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,559
Thank you for the meal.

798
01:01:22,199 --> 01:01:23,519
It's no problem at all, Ms. Nade.

799
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,280
Should we head home now?

800
01:01:26,519 --> 01:01:29,679
No, I don't want to see Mom yet.

801
01:01:30,639 --> 01:01:32,320
So where would you like to go?

802
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:34,199
Just let me know.

803
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:36,840
I'm happy to take you anywhere.

804
01:01:37,039 --> 01:01:40,840
You're renting a place
with a roommate, aren't you?

805
01:01:41,559 --> 01:01:45,039
Yes, Aun and I have been roommates
since we were at uni.

806
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:51,800
Well then.
Can you take me to your place?

807
01:01:54,079 --> 01:01:55,639
Oops, Ms. Nade.

808
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:58,920
Oh no. I'm sorry.

809
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:01,800
I'm sorry.

810
01:02:08,719 --> 01:02:09,719
Hold on.

811
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,760
Why did you have to be that shocked
when I asked you to take me there?

812
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:17,079
Are you keeping secrets in there?

813
01:02:17,199 --> 01:02:18,360
Tell me now.

814
01:02:18,920 --> 01:02:20,239
There aren't any secrets, Ms. Nade.

815
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:24,480
I was shocked Ms. Nadedao would
want to visit my rundown place.

816
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,039
I just want to know you better.

817
01:02:28,679 --> 01:02:30,280
So can I go there or not?

818
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:31,960
Of course.

819
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,719
But should you wash your face first?

820
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,320
I'm worried my acidic saliva

821
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:40,039
might ruin your pretty face.

822
01:02:41,719 --> 01:02:42,719
I'll be right back.

823
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:59,679
(Trai)

824
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:01,480
Trai?

825
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:05,079
Hello, Trai? Where have you been?

826
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:06,559
Don't ask me any questions yet.

827
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,440
Aun, can you check if
evidence of Joobjang's still around?

828
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,159
How come?

829
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:17,239
Oh, are you bringing over a girl?

830
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:20,400
Of course.
But I plan to come tomorrow.

831
01:03:21,159 --> 01:03:23,280
Can you help me? Please?

832
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:30,519
All right. Shall we go?

833
01:03:31,519 --> 01:03:32,519
Uh...

834
01:03:34,039 --> 01:03:37,079
Ms. Nade, I just called Aun.
He's not home.

835
01:03:37,159 --> 01:03:38,880
And I don't have the key right now.

836
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:40,400
Should we go there tomorrow instead?

837
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:45,639
But I'm still going to take you out.

838
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,880
Okay.

839
01:04:06,599 --> 01:04:07,880
Yes, Pa?

840
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,039
Thanks, Thom.

841
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:11,760
For what?

842
01:04:12,519 --> 01:04:15,639
For not telling Dad

843
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:18,079
Nai arrived later
than the agreed time.

844
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:23,400
Well, I knew

845
01:04:24,079 --> 01:04:28,360
you were going to admit you love him

846
01:04:28,639 --> 01:04:30,920
whether he was on time or not.

847
01:04:34,119 --> 01:04:37,440
I know you've been in love
with him for a while now.

848
01:04:39,719 --> 01:04:40,960
I'm sorry

849
01:04:41,719 --> 01:04:43,360
for disappointing you.

850
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:46,639
It's okay.

851
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:48,880
It's my fault

852
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:54,119
for admitting my feelings
to you too late.

853
01:04:55,400 --> 01:04:56,719
If I'd done it sooner,

854
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,840
I guarantee no guy
could get close to you.

855
01:05:00,039 --> 01:05:01,079
Trust me on that.

856
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,960
Lita, why are you willing
to tell us this?

857
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:09,360
Because

858
01:05:10,039 --> 01:05:11,320
I have feelings for Thom.

859
01:05:12,079 --> 01:05:14,360
I don't want you
and Nai to break up.

860
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,960
It might give him hope with you.

861
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,480
But please don't tell him just yet.

862
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:21,840
I'm embarrassed.

863
01:05:24,519 --> 01:05:25,519
Right, Thom.

864
01:05:26,639 --> 01:05:29,480
To thank you for helping me and Nai,

865
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,239
I have something to tell you.

866
01:05:31,920 --> 01:05:32,960
What is it?

867
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,880
Someone has a crush on you.

868
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:38,920
Huh? For real?

869
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:42,079
Who is it?

870
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:44,840
You have to find
the answer yourself.

871
01:05:45,480 --> 01:05:47,239
And don't stay in the dark,

872
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:49,039
or someone might whisk them away.

873
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,400
Toodles.

874
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:51,960
Okay.

875
01:06:01,719 --> 01:06:03,039
Who has a crush on me?

876
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:16,800
Yes, Lita?

877
01:06:17,719 --> 01:06:20,440
I came to see you at work,
but you're not here.

878
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:22,480
How can I help you?

879
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:24,119
When are you going to be back?

880
01:06:24,199 --> 01:06:25,360
Is something the matter?

881
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:28,719
Well, I'd like to
treat you to a meal

882
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:32,239
since Nade and I
hurt your feelings that day.

883
01:06:34,920 --> 01:06:39,679
Oh, can I swap the meal
for something else?

884
01:06:40,639 --> 01:06:42,360
Of course. What is it?

885
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:45,360
Well, Pa told me

886
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:48,199
someone has a crush on me.

887
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:51,760
Huh?

888
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:57,000
And I'm not a very observant person.

889
01:06:57,440 --> 01:07:00,400
So I want to find out
who that person is.

890
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:02,079
And...

891
01:07:03,079 --> 01:07:04,760
why do you want to find out?

892
01:07:04,840 --> 01:07:05,840
Well,

893
01:07:07,039 --> 01:07:08,760
I'm heartbroken right now.

894
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:13,280
In case that someone
is the right person,

895
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:17,079
they might be able to mend my heart.

896
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:18,760
Huh?

897
01:07:19,519 --> 01:07:20,639
Really?

898
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:22,400
Why is your voice like that?

899
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,719
Well, I know who has a crush on you.

900
01:07:27,199 --> 01:07:31,360
All right. I'll arrange for them
to meet you, okay?

901
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,960
Good. All right.

902
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:40,559
Okay. See you then.

903
01:07:40,639 --> 01:07:42,119
Okay. Bye.

904
01:07:46,719 --> 01:07:47,840
I'm sorry.

905
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:06,480
Uncle Phol's coming to pick us up.

906
01:08:07,480 --> 01:08:09,199
But it's going to be a while.

907
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:14,559
So? Are you happy about Dum now?

908
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,649
Yes. I'm super happy.

909
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,279
I think

910
01:08:26,479 --> 01:08:29,079
I'm going to have
a heart-to-heart talk with Madame.

911
01:08:32,039 --> 01:08:33,479
A heart-to-heart talk?

912
01:08:33,680 --> 01:08:34,840
Right.

913
01:08:36,609 --> 01:08:38,880
Well, I think

914
01:08:39,439 --> 01:08:42,239
if I didn't drive away that night

915
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:44,159
and got out to help Dum,

916
01:08:44,720 --> 01:08:46,609
I would've found out sooner

917
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:49,039
that the pile of blood wasn't his,

918
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:50,569
but it was chicken blood.

919
01:08:54,760 --> 01:08:57,199
I let my misunderstanding

920
01:08:57,649 --> 01:09:00,159
keep me down for a decade

921
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:05,079
only because I let
my emotions take control.

922
01:09:05,279 --> 01:09:08,479
I panicked and was in shock.

923
01:09:12,239 --> 01:09:13,439
So I think

924
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:15,609
I'll go and talk to Madame.

925
01:09:16,079 --> 01:09:17,920
I'm going to ask her again

926
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:20,399
what happened the night Da died.

927
01:09:21,569 --> 01:09:22,680
Maybe

928
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:26,039
she didn't mean to kill her.

929
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:30,720
But because of my own anger,

930
01:09:31,279 --> 01:09:34,920
I fixated on believing
it was Madame who did it.

931
01:09:43,840 --> 01:09:45,239
Would you believe it if I said

932
01:09:46,649 --> 01:09:48,880
I could tell you
I love you every day?

933
01:09:52,569 --> 01:09:53,760
I'll wait and see.

934
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:00,920
Oh, right.

935
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:05,439
Da used to tell me

936
01:10:05,920 --> 01:10:07,649
whenever you were very happy,

937
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:10,119
you'd go for a swim
in the river out back.

938
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:15,359
Do you want to go
for a swim together?

939
01:10:18,529 --> 01:10:19,529
Seriously?

940
01:10:19,609 --> 01:10:22,239
Of course.
I want to know what it's like.

941
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,359
I have Pawinee's secret to tell you.

942
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:45,609
What is it?

943
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:48,359
Are you looking for someone?

944
01:10:48,439 --> 01:10:49,529
I'm here to see Trai.

945
01:10:49,609 --> 01:10:51,039
- Ms. Nade.
- Trai.

946
01:10:52,119 --> 01:10:53,760
Are you trying to avenge Srikanda?

947
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,079
It's not what you think...

948
01:10:55,439 --> 01:10:56,880
Scumbag!

949
01:11:01,159 --> 01:11:02,760
Enjoy your happiness.

950
01:11:03,399 --> 01:11:04,720
Soon...

951
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:06,960
Do you remember me, sir?

952
01:11:07,880 --> 01:11:10,000
If you don't want
this to reach the police,

953
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,479
do whatever it takes to make
Pawinee divorce my son.

954
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,199
You dared to
threaten me, you evil...

955
01:11:17,609 --> 01:11:18,720
Dad.

956
01:11:19,239 --> 01:11:20,239
Dad.
