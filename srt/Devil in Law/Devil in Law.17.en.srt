1
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,530
Can you wash Nick's bottom?

2
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,840
Wash his bottom?

3
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,370
Ah!

4
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,159
You were going to strengthen the
relationship between our families.

5
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,599
How did Nai find out?

6
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,759
- About what?
- About me and Tin.

7
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,879
What clip are you talking about?

8
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,879
The one where she tried
to silence the kidnapper.

9
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,800
- Was that you?
- Madame.

10
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,400
Are you two

11
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,960
thinking of disowning me?

12
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,280
I'd like to know as well

13
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:01,840
if you two will survive

14
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:03,759
without me.

15
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,120
I'm right here.

16
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,759
And I will do whatever it takes

17
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,960
to prevent anything horrible
from happening to you,

18
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,759
okay?

19
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,840
Are you two

20
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:39,919
thinking of disowning me?

21
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,080
No, Mom.

22
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,360
We just want to be in control
of our own lives.

23
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,879
We want you to stop
meaning well toward us

24
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:50,759
because your good intentions

25
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,439
always cause us problems.

26
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,360
- Here you go.
- It's cooked now.

27
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,439
It's ready to eat.

28
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:49,000
- It's delicious.
- Dip in the sauce.

29
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,050
- How is it?
- How is it, Uncle?

30
00:04:54,439 --> 00:04:55,920
The sauce is really tasty.

31
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I agree.

32
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,199
I love the sauce.

33
00:04:58,319 --> 00:04:59,759
- Me too.
- I made it.

34
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,319
Wow.

35
00:05:01,399 --> 00:05:03,610
- It's delicious.
- How tasty.

36
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,879
- It's tasty.
- Guys.

37
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:05,959
Excuse me.

38
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,240
Sorry to interrupt
your Moo Krata time.

39
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,759
I'd like someone

40
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,839
to give a speech

41
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,399
to congratulate
Ms. Nade and Grandpa's success.

42
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,240
Yes.

43
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:21,879
Yes.

44
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,120
Mr. Nai, say something.

45
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,160
Nade and I only got to eat delicious
food as kids because of you two.

46
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,600
Dang.

47
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,560
Without you, we wouldn't have
had a good ride to school.

48
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,480
That's right.

49
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,279
It's getting emotional.
Show us some tears.

50
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,360
Your turn.

51
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:42,279
Ms. Nade, we should be
the ones thanking you

52
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:45,519
for tying the knot with Trai.

53
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,600
- Auntie.
- Mind your words.

54
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm not done.
If Trai upsets you in any way,

55
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,160
come to me.

56
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,759
I'll take care of him.

57
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:58,360
We'll teach him a lesson for you.

58
00:05:58,439 --> 00:05:59,600
I'll probably have killed him myself

59
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,399
before you get to him, Auntie Erb.

60
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:03,720
Calm down.

61
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,519
- Please don't kill him.
- I think we have said enough.

62
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,720
Let's just eat.

63
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,519
Don't try to get out of it.

64
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,240
What did you say?

65
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:12,720
I said, let's just eat.

66
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,360
Gosh.

67
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,800
The sauce is delicious.

68
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,720
- I agree.
- It's not even hot yet.

69
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,600
- Trai loves meat.
- It's fine.

70
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,480
You can feed Mr. Nai instead.

71
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,040
Eat it.

72
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,160
Eat it.

73
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,639
- Mr. Nai, it's good. I've tried it.
- This won't do.

74
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,120
- Can I try a small bite?
- Nai.

75
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
Let me try it first.

76
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,480
I'd like to know as well

77
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,199
if you two will survive

78
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,560
without me.

79
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:55,279
Nai.

80
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,959
I need to answer Thom's call.

81
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:02,560
Ms. Pa and Mr. Nai,
I should put Nick down for a nap.

82
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,040
He seems sleepy. Bye.

83
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,199
Bye.

84
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:08,000
- He can't eat it.
- I'll be right back.

85
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,600
Do you want some?

86
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,720
Grandpa, Nick can't eat that.

87
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,240
I'll eat it for him then.

88
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,319
All right.

89
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:22,399
Please forward the contract
to me so I can go over it first.

90
00:07:23,959 --> 00:07:26,199
Are you done with work?
Come and join our Moo Krata party.

91
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,759
Thom, I have to go.

92
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,399
Madame?

93
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,480
Madame?

94
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,480
Let's talk.

95
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,439
- Oh my gosh.
- Oh my gosh.

96
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,519
Let's go.

97
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,199
Pawinee.

98
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,879
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

99
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,959
It's all right.

100
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,839
Pa.

101
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,839
Come here.

102
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,480
Madame.

103
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,879
How dare you
try to hurt Pa on our turf?

104
00:08:24,959 --> 00:08:27,720
No, Dad. It was an accident.

105
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,160
What are you talking about?

106
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,959
What are you doing here?

107
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,480
I came to check on you two.

108
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,360
Since you look happy here,

109
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,360
I will have your houses demolished.

110
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,639
Do whatever you want with it.

111
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,720
We are not going back there anyway.

112
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,799
Nade.

113
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,240
If that's what you want to do,
go ahead.

114
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,559
But if you ask me,
I don't want you to do it.

115
00:08:55,639 --> 00:08:57,519
That place is my home.

116
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,559
I was planning

117
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,240
to live there with Nick and Pa
after the wedding.

118
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Wait.

119
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:08,519
There's not going to be a wedding.

120
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,799
Dad.

121
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,399
Break up with him now.

122
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,120
Don't lead him on.

123
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,090
Do it.

124
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,000
Are you breaking up with me?

125
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,559
Yes, she is.

126
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:28,600
My daughter isn't stupid enough to
be that witch's daughter-in-law.

127
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,639
She hired hit men
to kill my daughter.

128
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,879
Nit.

129
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:38,519
Madame said she didn't do it.

130
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,330
I don't believe her.

131
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,519
I don't believe her either.

132
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,000
She would do anything
to get what she wanted.

133
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,480
Ms. Nade.

134
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,360
What about you, Nai?

135
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:00,240
Do you think I did it?

136
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,759
You don't believe me either, do you?

137
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:11,279
Nai.

138
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,559
It really wasn't Madame.

139
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,039
- Hey, don't side with her.
- What?

140
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,000
I'm not siding with her.

141
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:22,000
It really wasn't her doing.

142
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:29,360
Tell everyone that it wasn't you.

143
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,210
Set them straight.

144
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,799
It was me.

145
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,120
I did it because I hate you.

146
00:10:50,879 --> 00:10:52,840
I don't want you
as my daughter-in-law.

147
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,840
Come here, Pa. Come.

148
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,600
I told you.

149
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,159
It was her doing.

150
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,320
What a shame, Nai.

151
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,240
You didn't believe me.

152
00:11:38,039 --> 00:11:40,519
Go away. Get out of here.

153
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,440
Don't come back again,

154
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,039
you heartless monster.

155
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,559
Is this the bad thing

156
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:58,159
that you were afraid
would happen to me?

157
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,679
I have to do everything
now that everyone is gone.

158
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:25,080
There's no one to complain to.

159
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,519
Gosh.

160
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,879
There's no one for me to tease.

161
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,759
It sucks.

162
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,440
Let me go.

163
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,440
Let me go.

164
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,080
Did you find anyone else?

165
00:13:14,159 --> 00:13:15,159
No, Boss.

166
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,919
These two are the only people here.

167
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,559
Good. Search the place.

168
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:22,080
Take any valuables you find.

169
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,399
Yes, Boss.

170
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,080
I heard everyone
turned their back on you.

171
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,039
I didn't believe it at first.

172
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:05,600
What do you want?

173
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,960
I came to collect the payment

174
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,200
you promised me.

175
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:14,200
Did you take the sachet
I put over there?

176
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,000
You mean this?

177
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,080
You can take any valuables
in the house.

178
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,519
Just give me back the sachet.

179
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,320
The item inside

180
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,159
must be extremely valuable then.

181
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,320
It's worthless to you.

182
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,399
Give it to me.

183
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,240
Don't move.

184
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,840
Show me where the valuables are.

185
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,440
Go.

186
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,519
Give it to me.

187
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,840
Don't move.

188
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,759
I have the right to kill you.

189
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,960
You're trespassing.

190
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:01,360
Give me back my stuff.

191
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,240
Give it back.

192
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,359
- Boss!
- Boss!

193
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:15,680
No way.

194
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,650
Take this.

195
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,000
You think you are so tough?

196
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:27,410
Boss, are you all right?

197
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:28,559
I'm fine.

198
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
Grab the valuables.

199
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
Check the safe.

200
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:44,559
(Tin sent you a photo)

201
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:58,119
What have you done to Madame?

202
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,410
Nothing, I haven't touched her yet.

203
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,890
But if you don't bring me
20 million baht in cash,

204
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:06,410
I will hurt her badly

205
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,200
to make up
for both of your betrayals.

206
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,680
How do I know that the photo
you sent me isn't photoshopped?

207
00:18:16,839 --> 00:18:17,839
Hey.

208
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,000
Greet your frenemy.
Remove the cloth.

209
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,240
Singkorn.

210
00:18:28,319 --> 00:18:31,039
Madame, what have they done to you?

211
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:33,119
Get him the cash.

212
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,240
Give him whatever he wants.

213
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,410
Just don't tell my children.

214
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,599
Why not?

215
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:41,680
I don't want them involved
in this mess.

216
00:18:46,119 --> 00:18:47,119
Did you hear her?

217
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:49,359
Prepare the cash for me.

218
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,799
I'll inform you
of the meeting place later.

219
00:18:52,839 --> 00:18:54,890
If you tell the police about this,

220
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,480
be prepared to collect
your best friend's lifeless body.

221
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,200
Hey.

222
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Take this too.

223
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:44,960
Let's go.

224
00:19:52,079 --> 00:19:53,410
Take her back to the warehouse.

225
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:55,920
We will kill her
once we get the money.

226
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,799
Let's go.

227
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,680
Ouch.

228
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:23,200
(Mom's House)

229
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,650
If you don't want it to scar,
you must apply ointment daily.

230
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:30,759
Do it for me then.

231
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:40,839
Welcome to the voicemail...

232
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
Ms. Nade.

233
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:58,559
Ms. Nade,
are you done in the bathroom?

234
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:00,799
- Yes.
- I'll take a shower then.

235
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,599
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

236
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,359
(Home)

237
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,200
Hello.

238
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,680
Ms. Nade!

239
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:18,650
Tin broke into the house
and robbed us.

240
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,170
He took Madame with him.

241
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:24,720
He said he was going to kill her.

242
00:21:25,279 --> 00:21:26,319
What?

243
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,359
What do you want me to do?
Should I call the police?

244
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,200
What do I want you to do?

245
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,890
Go live about it on the internet.

246
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,890
It should get my mother
some sympathy from netizens.

247
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:40,440
What are you talking about?

248
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,839
Do you think I don't know

249
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,440
that my mother ordered you
to call me

250
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:48,720
and lie about her being kidnapped

251
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:51,400
so we would feel sorry for her?

252
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,920
Please tell my mother

253
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:56,599
that she can't fool me anymore.

254
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:58,079
I have to go.

255
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,200
Ms. Nade.

256
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,559
What's the matter, Nade?

257
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,319
Mom's seeking attention.

258
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,839
She ordered Pit to call me

259
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,759
and say Tin has kidnapped her.

260
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:22,559
Our mother would never let anything
like that happen to her.

261
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:24,119
Just ignore her.

262
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,200
You don't think it's a lie, do you?

263
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,519
No.

264
00:22:36,279 --> 00:22:38,200
My mother would find a different way

265
00:22:38,839 --> 00:22:40,079
to seek attention.

266
00:22:59,759 --> 00:23:00,839
Joy.

267
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:03,759
Can we borrow your car?
We're going to Madam Nuan's house.

268
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,319
Sure.

269
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,279
Can you drive?

270
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,359
Yes.

271
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:12,400
- Thank you, Joy.
- Thank you.

272
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,680
Where are you going?

273
00:23:16,079 --> 00:23:18,319
I'm going to Madame Nuan's house
to check on her.

274
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:21,200
Do you think
what Nadedao told you is true?

275
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:22,680
That Madame has been kidnapped?

276
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,279
I agree with Nadedao.

277
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:27,319
I'm sure Madame Nuan is lying.

278
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,200
I don't know if it's true or not

279
00:23:29,599 --> 00:23:31,079
but I have to check on her.

280
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,559
She's my mother after all.

281
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,279
Here.

282
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:41,160
I don't know what's going on,

283
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,519
but take this with you.

284
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,599
Only use it when it's necessary.

285
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
Here.

286
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,079
Thank you.

287
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:54,599
Take care of my daughter.

288
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
I will.

289
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:03,480
- Pa.
- I'll be back soon.

290
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,839
- Call me.
- I will.

291
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,799
- Let's go.
- Take care of yourself.

292
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,240
Hello, it's me, Pa.

293
00:24:41,319 --> 00:24:43,799
Ms. Pa...

294
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,079
Tin took Madame with him.

295
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,279
He said he was taking her
to his warehouse.

296
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,720
But I don't think where that is.

297
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:56,039
Hey, get her.

298
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,480
Hey, stop.

299
00:24:59,359 --> 00:25:00,400
Stop!

300
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,599
I know where it is.

301
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,559
(Singkorn)

302
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,359
Yes, Singkorn.

303
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,920
Madame has been kidnapped by Tin.

304
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,359
He told me to prepare cash for him.

305
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,279
Nai.

306
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,480
Madame asked me not to tell you,

307
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,160
but I had to.

308
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:26,359
I'm on my way to rescue her.

309
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,720
Please prepare the cash
and call the police.

310
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,440
I'll keep you updated.
Thank you very much.

311
00:25:31,519 --> 00:25:32,519
Sure.

312
00:26:11,839 --> 00:26:12,920
Hello, Boss.

313
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,839
Nueng is switching cars.

314
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,359
Yes, I know.

315
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,640
Boss.

316
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,839
I'll go buy a first aid kit for you.

317
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,839
- Come back quickly.
- I will.

318
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,440
Dang.

319
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,000
You stole a lot of stuff.

320
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,200
Hey.

321
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,680
Charn?

322
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,440
You took forever to call me back.

323
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,119
I need your help.

324
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:17,599
It's urgent.

325
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,279
It's this place, Nai.

326
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,480
Mom.

327
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
See you.

328
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:42,559
Stay calm.

329
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,640
Boss!

330
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:47,359
What's going on?

331
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,039
Boy, go see what's going on.

332
00:29:00,119 --> 00:29:01,119
Yes, Boss.

333
00:29:15,119 --> 00:29:16,119
Top!

334
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,880
Top, what happened?

335
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:19,279
Top!

336
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,599
Hey!

337
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,240
Top...

338
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,160
Who are you?

339
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,559
Let me go.

340
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,319
Boy, what's happening?

341
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,920
- Madame!
- Mom!

342
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,119
Die!

343
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:08,960
Darn it!

344
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,039
Mom.

345
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,160
Madame.

346
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,519
Madame.

347
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,519
I'm fine, Nai. I'm fine.

348
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:41,480
Nai, go after Tin.

349
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:42,960
I'll stay with her.

350
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:45,759
- Please take care of her.
- I will.

351
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,079
Madame, hang in there.

352
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,160
Madame.

353
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,559
Madame.

354
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,279
Hang in there, Madame.

355
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,400
Let's get out of here.

356
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,160
Madame.

357
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:22,720
Madame.

358
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:28,799
Madame.

359
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,079
What is it, Madame?

360
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,200
What is it?

361
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,799
They are pictures of Nai and Nade

362
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,119
when their father

363
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,599
had recently passed away.

364
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:07,039
Now that I look back,

365
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,599
the toughest time in my life

366
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:16,319
was also the most heartwarming time

367
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,519
because my children
were there for me.

368
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,960
And I knew...

369
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,799
that they didn't need

370
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,240
anyone else

371
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,440
but me.

372
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,160
Now,

373
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:44,200
I have everything
I could ever ask for...

374
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,920
but I don't have anyone left.

375
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:55,240
My children don't need me anymore.

376
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,440
No.

377
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,640
It's not true, Madame.

378
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,160
Nai and Nade...

379
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,559
will always need you.

380
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:14,480
You have to keep it.

381
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,440
If I die today,

382
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:27,759
I know I'll die in peace.

383
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,759
Pawinee.

384
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:36,200
If anything happens to me,

385
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,240
please take care

386
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:44,880
of Nai and Nade for me, Pawinee.

387
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,039
No.

388
00:33:47,119 --> 00:33:49,200
Madame.

389
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:52,960
You will be all right.
Hang in there.

390
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,200
Madame.

391
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,039
Hang in there.

392
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,000
All right, Madame? All right?

393
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,480
Let's go.

394
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,639
Don't bother crawling away.

395
00:35:33,769 --> 00:35:35,000
Hang in there, Madame.

396
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,079
Pawinee.

397
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:51,719
I'm leaving Nai

398
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,679
and Nade in your care.

399
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:03,400
Take care of them.

400
00:37:07,519 --> 00:37:08,599
Madame.

401
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,239
Madame, hang in there.

402
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:14,239
We will be at the hospital soon.
Hang in there.

403
00:37:16,289 --> 00:37:17,519
Madame.

404
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,769
I'd like you to be prepared

405
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:58,400
because I'm going to convince
everyone to leave you soon

406
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,840
so you can finally understand
that your money

407
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,559
can hire them for work,

408
00:38:02,639 --> 00:38:06,559
but you can't hire their heart
to love you like they always do.

409
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:34,039
Nade? Nai?

410
00:38:42,769 --> 00:38:43,960
You are awake.

411
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,599
I'll go get a nurse.

412
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:19,960
(One Week Later)

413
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:24,769
You're ready to leave.

414
00:39:52,679 --> 00:39:53,920
Madame.

415
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,809
Tin's been arrested.

416
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,199
He won't see the light of day
for a very long time.

417
00:40:08,159 --> 00:40:09,769
Madame, I forgot

418
00:40:10,329 --> 00:40:12,000
to give you this.

419
00:40:26,769 --> 00:40:27,769
Mom.

420
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:31,400
Madame.

421
00:40:34,559 --> 00:40:37,400
I'm fine, Nai. I'm fine.

422
00:40:38,519 --> 00:40:41,329
Nai, go after Tin.

423
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,840
I'll stay with her.

424
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:45,559
- Please take care of her.
- I will.

425
00:41:06,769 --> 00:41:09,329
- Welcome home, Madame.
- Welcome home, Madame.

426
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,329
Thank you, Pit and Tang.

427
00:41:12,329 --> 00:41:13,360
What is Nade...

428
00:41:18,329 --> 00:41:19,809
You should go upstairs and rest.

429
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,920
Madame.

430
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,719
Hello.

431
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:35,329
I went to visit you at the hospital,

432
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,360
but the doctor had already
discharged you.

433
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:38,599
How are you feeling?

434
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:40,809
I'm better now.

435
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:43,000
Thank you for visiting me.

436
00:41:44,809 --> 00:41:47,519
When did you come back, Lita?

437
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,360
A few days ago.

438
00:41:50,679 --> 00:41:51,679
I...

439
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,400
went there and begged her
to come back.

440
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:56,769
My life got lonely

441
00:41:57,119 --> 00:41:58,119
without her.

442
00:41:59,289 --> 00:42:01,719
If you don't want me
to run away again,

443
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:04,079
be mindful of your hurtful words.

444
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:05,719
I know.

445
00:42:12,719 --> 00:42:14,000
Lita.

446
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:15,840
I know

447
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:19,360
how unpleasant your father can be.

448
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,079
But please talk things out

449
00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:23,289
whenever you disagree on something.

450
00:42:23,809 --> 00:42:25,679
Don't stop loving him no matter what

451
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:27,329
because

452
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,599
he loves you with all of his heart.

453
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,440
I know.

454
00:42:34,769 --> 00:42:36,880
That's why I can never
stay mad at him for long.

455
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:45,599
If you are not in a rush,

456
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,440
stay for lunch.

457
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:50,159
It's lonely eating by myself.

458
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:53,360
My father and I came
to have lunch with you anyway.

459
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,000
However, you should get some rest
first. I'll walk you to your room.

460
00:42:58,329 --> 00:42:59,329
Let's go.

461
00:43:02,769 --> 00:43:03,769
This way.

462
00:43:08,769 --> 00:43:10,239
Wait a moment, Mr. Singkorn.

463
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:14,239
Have you heard?

464
00:43:15,239 --> 00:43:16,400
About what?

465
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,809
So you haven't heard.

466
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:20,840
Is there anything I should know?

467
00:43:21,039 --> 00:43:23,079
You'll find out soon. After you.

468
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:31,039
Surprise!

469
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:33,440
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

470
00:43:35,769 --> 00:43:37,440
Yes!

471
00:43:39,769 --> 00:43:42,239
Welcome home, Mom!

472
00:43:55,679 --> 00:43:56,679
Mom.

473
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,480
I thought no one cared
about me anymore.

474
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,559
I was hospitalized for days.

475
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,320
Why didn't anyone visit me?

476
00:44:08,519 --> 00:44:10,320
We visited you every day

477
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:12,320
when you were sleeping.

478
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:17,159
- Tom.
- Yes.

479
00:44:17,239 --> 00:44:18,599
Why didn't you tell me?

480
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,079
It wouldn't have been a surprise
if I had told you.

481
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:24,880
How mean.

482
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,519
- All of you are mean.
- I know.

483
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:29,719
Don't blame them.

484
00:44:30,719 --> 00:44:32,199
It was my plan.

485
00:44:33,519 --> 00:44:36,599
I wanted you to know

486
00:44:37,239 --> 00:44:39,119
how it would feel

487
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,039
if you had no one left.

488
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:46,360
Madame.

489
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,800
Thank you very much
for protecting me.

490
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,599
Thanks to you,

491
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:58,000
I didn't get hurt at all.

492
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:03,199
If it hadn't been for you,

493
00:45:05,199 --> 00:45:06,760
Pa could have gotten hurt.

494
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,119
Thank you.

495
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,719
And I'm sorry

496
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,679
for not believing you

497
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:18,360
when you said
you never meant Pa harm.

498
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:27,119
Let's start anew, Mom.

499
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,679
Your father and grandma
are back on good terms now, Nick.

500
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:27,960
- Yes.
- Yes.

501
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,079
Nick...

502
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,840
Everyone, please ask the freelancers

503
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:59,119
who were working on the Health Plus
project to resume their work.

504
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:00,960
Ple,

505
00:47:01,039 --> 00:47:04,880
once Singkorn compensates us
for putting the project on hold,

506
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:06,800
- please give everyone their share.
- Yes.

507
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:07,880
Okay.

508
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:11,159
(Nai)

509
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:15,960
Please excuse me.

510
00:47:16,119 --> 00:47:17,119
Yes.

511
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,440
Yes, Nai.

512
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,679
Lita is at my house right now.

513
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,320
Did you say Lita?

514
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,480
Lita is there?

515
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,480
Wait. Seriously speaking,
which Lita are you referring to?

516
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:37,159
How many Litas do you know?

517
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,559
Well, I know
a few people named Lita.

518
00:47:40,639 --> 00:47:41,880
This Lita is the person

519
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,559
you have been looking for.

520
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:48,039
Nai, be honest with me.

521
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,519
I don't want to be
disappointed later again.

522
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:52,239
Are you talking about Lita,
Singkorn's daughter?

523
00:47:57,920 --> 00:47:59,519
Everyone, let's take a photo.

524
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:00,920
I should get out of the frame.

525
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,360
- It's fine, Dao. Stay in the photo.
- Okay.

526
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:06,719
Ready, one, two...

527
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:10,920
Lita, can you hold Nick?

528
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:12,679
It's okay.

529
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,960
- Hold him.
- Go ahead.

530
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,039
Come here.

531
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:22,679
- Turn this way.
- Nick.

532
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,960
- Okay.
- Look here.

533
00:48:24,519 --> 00:48:25,519
One, two...

534
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,199
Okay.

535
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:30,920
Please send me the photos.

536
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,000
Sure.

537
00:48:49,679 --> 00:48:50,880
Lita!

538
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:55,880
I'm sorry I'm late.

539
00:48:55,960 --> 00:48:57,440
No, you arrived at the perfect time.

540
00:48:57,679 --> 00:48:59,559
- Lend me your bike.
- Okay.

541
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,960
- I'm sorry.
- Don't worry about it.

542
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,480
Take the helmet, Thom.

543
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,000
- Aon, how do I start the engine?
- Yes?

544
00:49:09,199 --> 00:49:11,840
Press the right button
while you grab onto the left brake.

545
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:12,840
Okay.

546
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:14,639
- Hold the brake, press the button.
- Okay.

547
00:49:14,719 --> 00:49:16,719
- There you go.
- Okay, see you later.

548
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:21,559
Ride safely.

549
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:27,280
He's probably going to see Lita.

550
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,800
- Get back to work.
- Fine.

551
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:32,960
Our boss is in love.

552
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,519
Thom.

553
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,199
I like you.

554
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,599
Were you talking to Lita?

555
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,079
Yes.

556
00:50:04,199 --> 00:50:07,320
Lita, I'm sorry I didn't answer you

557
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,280
when you asked me

558
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,239
how I felt about you.

559
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:14,800
The person who has a crush on you

560
00:50:17,360 --> 00:50:18,440
is me.

561
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:22,480
Do you think it's possible

562
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:26,599
or impossible

563
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:28,639
between us?

564
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,920
I wasn't sure

565
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:34,880
how I felt about you.

566
00:50:36,719 --> 00:50:37,960
But now,

567
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:39,880
I'm sure

568
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:42,239
that I like you.

569
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:52,480
I have a question for you.

570
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:55,519
Will you...

571
00:50:57,679 --> 00:50:59,239
be my girlfriend?

572
00:51:09,159 --> 00:51:10,239
I think...

573
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,239
I should go.

574
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:16,519
I'm starting to feel
like a third wheel.

575
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:20,679
- Take all the time you need.
- Thanks.

576
00:51:25,519 --> 00:51:26,519
Goodbye.

577
00:51:32,639 --> 00:51:33,639
Well...

578
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:45,880
I'm really sorry.

579
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,039
I couldn't help it.
I just miss you so much.

580
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:51,960
I really do.

581
00:51:55,239 --> 00:51:56,239
So...

582
00:51:56,400 --> 00:51:59,719
you haven't answered my question.

583
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:01,480
Will you...

584
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:03,880
be

585
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,880
my girlfriend?

586
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,440
There's your answer.

587
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:13,239
Mom.

588
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:17,159
- Sit down.
- Sit.

589
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:26,000
Nade and I would like
to apologize to you.

590
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,480
We are sorry for misjudging you.

591
00:53:44,119 --> 00:53:45,159
Come here.

592
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:01,920
I'm sorry

593
00:54:03,159 --> 00:54:06,679
for making you feel uncomfortable.

594
00:54:08,039 --> 00:54:10,719
Back then, I was worried

595
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:14,599
that you two wouldn't survive
in this world.

596
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:17,800
But now I know

597
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,400
that both of you

598
00:54:21,519 --> 00:54:23,360
are much stronger than I thought.

599
00:54:26,239 --> 00:54:27,599
Especially Nade.

600
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,400
Who would have thought that she
would be able to make a living?

601
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:35,360
I can do it
because I'm your daughter.

602
00:54:36,519 --> 00:54:38,079
You always taught me

603
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:40,679
to never let go of something
until it's mine.

604
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,000
Thank you for teaching me, Mom.

605
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:49,360
By the way, please be patient

606
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:51,599
with Trai.

607
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:54,679
Trai and I are working hard
to save money

608
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:59,440
for the dowry when he asks you
for my hand in marriage.

609
00:54:59,519 --> 00:55:00,760
No need.

610
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,639
Save the money for your future.

611
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:05,880
All I want

612
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:09,679
is for Trai to be a good person

613
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,639
who loves you sincerely.

614
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:34,079
This necklace...

615
00:55:36,719 --> 00:55:38,840
It's the necklace you gave Srikanda.

616
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,559
I was wrong about her back then.

617
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:44,639
I thought she was with you
for your money.

618
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,920
I'm sorry, Nai.

619
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,039
It's okay, Mom.

620
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,760
Do you believe now

621
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:22,800
that Da and her family
are good people?

622
00:56:24,599 --> 00:56:25,920
Now,

623
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,199
I realize

624
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:32,480
that there's no better family
than Srikanda's family.

625
00:56:35,519 --> 00:56:37,159
We are lucky

626
00:56:37,239 --> 00:56:40,800
they didn't lose their patience
and leave us.

627
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,000
Keep this necklace.

628
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:48,519
Nick can give it
to the woman he loves.

629
00:56:49,199 --> 00:56:50,280
Yes, Mom.

630
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:55,519
Mom.

631
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:59,119
I need your opinion on something.

632
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:01,159
It's actually about Pa.

633
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,079
What is it?

634
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,519
Everyone, come here.

635
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:21,079
Mr. Nai's about
to propose to Ms. Pa.

636
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,719
Keep it down.

637
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,800
Let me see.

638
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:28,599
Keep it down.

639
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,000
Let's go to the other side.

640
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:31,280
The other side.

641
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:33,719
I'm coming too.

642
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,239
I actually

643
00:57:37,559 --> 00:57:40,039
bought this ring for Pa
a long time ago.

644
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:41,599
I've been waiting
for the right time.

645
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:47,280
Do you think it's time
I give her the ring?

646
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:49,840
If you ask me,

647
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,079
there's no better time than this.

648
00:57:57,320 --> 00:57:58,800
I've passed the first obstacle.

649
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,599
Here comes the second obstacle.

650
00:58:04,599 --> 00:58:05,639
Nai.

651
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,599
Let me do my job as your mother.

652
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:19,519
Panit.

653
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:23,320
I'm sorry I mistreated you

654
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:25,119
and your daughters.

655
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:27,440
But

656
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:29,599
I'm a better person now.

657
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,519
Will you give me a chance

658
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:36,639
to be Pawinee's mother-in-law?

659
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:38,480
Oh my gosh.

660
00:58:49,719 --> 00:58:51,639
You're asking for her hand yourself.

661
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:55,280
How can I turn you down?

662
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,800
All right then.

663
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:02,199
I'll let my daughter marry your son.

664
00:59:03,559 --> 00:59:07,960
- Yes!
- Yes!

665
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:31,719
Pa.

666
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:35,320
Will you marry me?

667
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,519
Yes.

668
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:11,599
- Kiss her.
- Kiss her.

669
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:13,519
- Kiss her.
- Kiss her.

670
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:15,960
- Kiss her.
- Kiss her.

671
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:18,760
- Kiss her.
- Kiss her.

672
01:00:28,599 --> 01:00:29,760
This sucks.

673
01:00:29,840 --> 01:00:31,519
Let's watch them kiss at night.

674
01:00:33,239 --> 01:00:34,880
You are such a pervert.

675
01:00:54,639 --> 01:00:56,760
Everyone, let's take a photo.

676
01:00:57,679 --> 01:00:58,840
Yes.

677
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:00,639
I'll take the photo for you.

678
01:01:01,719 --> 01:01:03,519
Do you want to carry Nick?

679
01:01:03,599 --> 01:01:05,000
Give him to me.

680
01:01:05,079 --> 01:01:07,639
Here you go.

681
01:01:07,719 --> 01:01:09,440
Wait.

682
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:11,000
- Trai.
- Oh?

683
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:15,159
What about me?

684
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:16,559
Go sit.

685
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:17,760
Sit down.

686
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,519
(Wait!)

687
01:01:34,639 --> 01:01:40,400
(It’s Not Over Yet)

688
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:45,559
(Six Years Later)

689
01:01:57,239 --> 01:01:58,440
Madame.

690
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:01,440
You said you weren't interested
in their business deal.

691
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:03,079
Explain this meeting then.

692
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:05,599
You are betraying me again,
Singkorn.

693
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:10,679
According to section 15 of
the contract you had Mother sign

694
01:02:10,880 --> 01:02:13,719
when you hired her
as your consultant,

695
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:18,280
if you meet a person referred
by Mother behind her back,

696
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:22,840
she has the right to demand
any compensation from you.

697
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:24,440
This time,

698
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,920
I want 15 million baht.

699
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,000
What?

700
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:39,800
Sign it whenever you are ready.

701
01:02:40,280 --> 01:02:42,519
Otherwise, you can meet us in court.

702
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:45,639
As her personal lawyer,

703
01:02:46,199 --> 01:02:50,239
I will teach you
an unforgettable lesson.

704
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,559
Thank you for your cooperation.

705
01:03:19,320 --> 01:03:20,800
I will donate

706
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,159
some of the money
to the anti-corruption foundation

707
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:25,719
and save some

708
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:28,760
to celebrate the arrival
of my grandchild.

709
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,719
Walk slowly.

710
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,920
You are walking too fast
for a pregnant lady.

711
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:42,280
Take it slow.

712
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:45,559
- Hello.
- Hello.

713
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:50,519
What happened?

714
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:54,639
Don't be alarmed. It's nothing new.

715
01:03:57,039 --> 01:03:59,599
See you when the baby arrives, Lita.

716
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:01,440
See you.

717
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:13,000
Did you betray her again?

718
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:15,400
When are you going to learn?

719
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,199
Never.

720
01:04:17,679 --> 01:04:19,880
Ever since Pawinee
became her assistant,

721
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,239
everyone's been afraid
of Madame Nuan.

722
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,639
But not me.

723
01:04:24,039 --> 01:04:28,519
Just you wait.
I'll beat those two one day.

724
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:35,599
Don't stress out, honey.

725
01:04:36,119 --> 01:04:37,159
Calm down.

726
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:53,320
Madame, Mr. Lee's secretary
sent you a message.

727
01:04:53,400 --> 01:04:55,199
He wants to see you right now.

728
01:04:56,679 --> 01:04:58,360
Tell him I'm busy.

729
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,800
I've got something more important
than his project to tend to.

730
01:05:00,880 --> 01:05:02,039
We should go.

731
01:05:02,119 --> 01:05:04,639
We can't be even a second late
to this event.

732
01:05:15,559 --> 01:05:18,039
- Hello.
- Hello, Madame.

733
01:05:18,599 --> 01:05:19,719
Did everything go well?

734
01:05:19,800 --> 01:05:21,159
Yes.

735
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:24,199
My daughter-in-law
is an amazing lawyer after all.

736
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,400
Why are you just arriving now?

737
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,159
He took forever to pick a gift
for his grandson.

738
01:05:32,239 --> 01:05:33,320
Seriously.

739
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:39,480
To be honest,
I was a little worried.

740
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:40,960
I wasn't sure

741
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:42,800
whether my beloved grandson

742
01:05:44,199 --> 01:05:46,559
would be able to take
this giant present home.

743
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:51,400
Guess what's inside.

744
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:56,440
Here I come.

745
01:06:02,840 --> 01:06:04,280
Here they go again.

746
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,800
Let's go inside.

747
01:06:09,159 --> 01:06:10,320
He's probably waiting for us.

748
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:11,639
Let's go.

749
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:14,920
My goodness, Panit.

750
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:16,280
- What?
- Let me go in first.

751
01:06:16,360 --> 01:06:17,400
Where's Auntie Orn?

752
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:19,000
She will probably be late.

753
01:06:20,800 --> 01:06:22,719
Okay, great job.

754
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:24,280
Nick!

755
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:27,519
Yes! Grandpa and Grandma are here!

756
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,639
- Hello.
- Hello.

757
01:06:29,719 --> 01:06:33,159
I've got a present for you.

758
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:34,840
Me too.

759
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:40,039
I'll go get the cake then.

760
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:45,400
- Tom, you can put that down.
- Yes?

761
01:06:48,400 --> 01:06:49,559
Thank you.

762
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:52,360
Come to me.

763
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:54,199
- Come to Grandma.
- Come to Grandpa.

764
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:56,760
- Let's hug. Give me a kiss.
- Come to me.

765
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,400
Come to me first.

766
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,239
- Come to me.
- Come to me.

767
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,960
- Come on.
- Come.

768
01:07:02,039 --> 01:07:04,239
- Come on.
- Come on.

769
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,880
- Come on.
- Come to me.

770
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,119
Come on.

771
01:07:08,239 --> 01:07:10,639
Yes.

772
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:14,159
Dad said there's a baby
inside your belly.

773
01:07:14,639 --> 01:07:16,639
Nick!

774
01:07:24,920 --> 01:07:29,199
Nick, I told you to keep it a secret
until we got home.

775
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:31,000
Uh-oh.

776
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:36,320
- Pa.
- What?

777
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:37,519
Are you pregnant?

778
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:40,880
Yes, I'm three months pregnant.

779
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:44,159
That's great.

780
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:46,760
You should come and live with me.

781
01:07:46,840 --> 01:07:48,559
I'll find someone to look after you.

782
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:51,239
No, she's my daughter.

783
01:07:51,320 --> 01:07:52,400
She has to live with me.

784
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:55,000
It's my job to take care
of my daughter and grandchild.

785
01:07:55,079 --> 01:07:57,280
She's my daughter-in-law.

786
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:59,960
And Nai is my son.
I gave birth to him.

787
01:08:00,039 --> 01:08:01,360
Pawinee is my daughter-in-law.

788
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:02,599
It's not the same.

789
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:03,760
How?

790
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,760
How is it the same?
She's my daughter.

791
01:08:05,840 --> 01:08:07,440
It's my grandbaby too.

792
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:09,679
- But she's my daughter.
- That's enough.

793
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:11,599
Pa can live with Nai.

794
01:08:11,719 --> 01:08:13,519
Nai and Nick can take care of Pa.

795
01:08:13,599 --> 01:08:16,720
Isn't that right, my beloved nephew?

796
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,279
Yes, my beautiful aunt.

797
01:08:21,079 --> 01:08:22,920
- How is it the same?
- Dad.

798
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:25,649
- It's time for the cake.
- Yes.

799
01:08:25,720 --> 01:08:27,439
- Let's go.
- Come on.

800
01:08:28,720 --> 01:08:29,760
Let's go.

801
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,399
- She's my daughter.
- It's my grandbaby.

802
01:08:31,479 --> 01:08:32,479
She's my daughter.

803
01:08:32,569 --> 01:08:34,439
- Nick.
- Nick.

804
01:08:34,569 --> 01:08:36,359
Come.

805
01:08:36,439 --> 01:08:38,529
Whose cake is this?

806
01:08:38,609 --> 01:08:40,680
Look.

807
01:08:40,840 --> 01:08:41,960
Do you like it?

808
01:08:42,039 --> 01:08:45,079
- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to you.

809
01:08:45,199 --> 01:08:47,800
- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to you.

810
01:08:47,880 --> 01:08:50,960
- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to you.

811
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:53,920
You annoyed everyone.

812
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,529
What a rotten mouth.

813
01:08:55,609 --> 01:08:57,960
- But my face is beautiful.
- Is that so?

814
01:08:58,039 --> 01:08:59,680
What's your problem?

815
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,800
Why are you such a violent person?

816
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,039
- It's your fault.
- What?

817
01:09:03,119 --> 01:09:06,649
- Happy birthday, happy birthday.
- Happy birthday, happy birthday.

818
01:09:06,720 --> 01:09:09,920
- Happy birthday to you.
- Happy birthday to you.

819
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,880
Wow.

820
01:09:13,760 --> 01:09:15,479
Great job.

821
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:19,800
You...

822
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,479
Dad, why are Grandpa
and Grandma always fighting?

823
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,439
Because they love you very much.

824
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,000
You are not tired of them
fighting, are you?

825
01:09:30,079 --> 01:09:32,359
No, I'm a "strong" boy.

826
01:09:32,439 --> 01:09:35,079
Who taught you to say that?

827
01:09:36,199 --> 01:09:37,319
I did.

828
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:40,609
Strong people
have a lot of strength.

829
01:09:40,680 --> 01:09:42,039
And we are

830
01:09:42,119 --> 01:09:44,529
- a strong family.
- A strong family.

831
01:09:44,609 --> 01:09:46,840
Wow.

832
01:09:54,319 --> 01:09:55,479
Kiss your dad back.

833
01:09:56,399 --> 01:10:02,039
(The end)
