1
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,159
Have you found someone
to teach Pa a lesson?

2
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,719
Uncle! What do we do?

3
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,039
I'm making her son pay
for the damage which she caused me.

4
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,159
Your father should live with us

5
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,159
while the house is under renovation.

6
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,360
Swim to the other side for me.

7
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,960
What happened, Nai?

8
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,439
Pa, come back. Oh no!

9
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,879
Pa humiliated you today

10
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,879
because she thinks
you tried to hurt her father first.

11
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,439
It's her way of getting back at you.

12
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,199
Are you okay with sharing
a husband with your sister?

13
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,919
I'm going to get over him.

14
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,039
There, there. There, there.

15
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,280
- Hm?
- Sir,

16
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,639
- let's head inside.
- What's the matter?

17
00:03:09,719 --> 00:03:11,879
Madame is about
to come down for a swim.

18
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,039
There's a rule here.

19
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,360
If she's going for a swim,

20
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,080
everyone has to stay inside
and not wander about

21
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,919
because she wants privacy.

22
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,800
We were just eating noodles
and had to skedaddle. Let's go.

23
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:21,879
- Let's go.
- Hang on.

24
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,280
Is the pool deep?

25
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,520
Not really.

26
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,199
I saw Uncle Phol cleaning it,
and he was able to stand in there.

27
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,240
I see.

28
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,639
- Let's go.
- Wait.

29
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,599
Let me go and have a look
as to why she needs so much privacy.

30
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,719
Sir, no!

31
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,439
- Let's go and take a gander, Nick.
- Sir!

32
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,479
Sir, wait!

33
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,680
We should leave,
or we might get a telling-off.

34
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,000
Hold onto Nick for me.

35
00:03:55,479 --> 00:03:56,879
I'd like to find something to do.

36
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:02,080
Oh? Where are you going?

37
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,120
Woohoo!

38
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,680
The water is cool
and refreshing in this pool.

39
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:14,919
But I don't think
it's suitable for you, Madame.

40
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,360
I think you should be swimming

41
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:18,519
in the River Styx in the Underworld.

42
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:20,759
- Tom!
- Yes?

43
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,050
I've lost interest!

44
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,120
We're leaving!

45
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,319
What's the hurry?
Come and swim with me.

46
00:04:26,399 --> 00:04:28,800
Stay away from me, ringworm!

47
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,120
Don't worry. I don't have ringworm.

48
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,639
I only have a jock itch.

49
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,319
Have you heard of it?

50
00:04:36,399 --> 00:04:38,079
Whoa, I think it's playing up.

51
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,879
- Get someone to clean the pool!
- Yes, Madame.

52
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:43,959
Disgusting!

53
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,439
Ew!

54
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,120
We won't have to discuss work
at a cafe or shopping mall anymore.

55
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:57,120
Oh, Nai.

56
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,920
Why don't you ask Pa
to come and work for us?

57
00:05:00,279 --> 00:05:02,730
Didn't she graduate from overseas?

58
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,959
Her English must be excellent.

59
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,959
And for Mr. Singkorn's
Pop Rock Work Concert,

60
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,170
we'll have to deal with foreigners
and international music bands.

61
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,639
I think that might be a good idea.

62
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,879
Maybe not.

63
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:22,519
If we're colleagues,

64
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,920
we'll have to be around
each other for the whole day.

65
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,000
We'll be sick of each other.

66
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,759
You're a weirdo, you know.

67
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,240
You have a beautiful wife.

68
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:31,120
But instead of keeping her close,

69
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:35,480
you let another guy see her
for the whole day, every day.

70
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:37,560
Another guy?

71
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,879
Thomtawee, of course.

72
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,199
Don't say I didn't warn you.

73
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,040
He's good-looking

74
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:47,680
and still single.

75
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,000
Those two seem pretty close as well.

76
00:05:51,079 --> 00:05:53,439
What if their chemistry ends up
having a reaction?

77
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,079
Whoa.

78
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,879
Keep that in mind,

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,920
and don't say I didn't warn you.

80
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,920
For one of three women
we're going to interview

81
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,759
for the Health Plus commercial,

82
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,399
I'd like to propose

83
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,199
Madame Nuan.

84
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,560
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

85
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,079
What do you think, Pa?

86
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,360
Pa?

87
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,800
Pa?

88
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:31,319
I said

89
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:34,680
I'd like to propose Madame Nuan.
What do you think?

90
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,920
Then I'll have to ask you first.

91
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,879
Why do you think Madame Nuan

92
00:06:41,279 --> 00:06:44,240
is suitable to go onstage
to talk about dog food?

93
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,040
- Huh?
- What?

94
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,639
- Pa.
- Yes?

95
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,839
We're having a meeting
about the Health Plus drink.

96
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:55,680
The dog food discussion

97
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,279
ended yesterday.

98
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,079
I'm sorry.

99
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,920
I was a little bit
too deep in thought.

100
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,720
- Pa!
- Hm?

101
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,879
That's my cup.

102
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,720
Yours is over there.

103
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,120
- Sorry.
- Mm.

104
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,480
What's the matter, Pa?

105
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,959
Why do you seem distracted today?

106
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,319
I just found out

107
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:36,040
My dad has a heart condition.

108
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,480
I'm worried

109
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,240
he'll find out about what happened.

110
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:44,839
Madame Nuan hates me.

111
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,199
And if she finds out about this,
she won't let it slide.

112
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,199
And if my dad finds out,

113
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,519
he's going to be
disappointed in me as well.

114
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,720
He might even have a heart attack.

115
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,079
I don't want to imagine that!

116
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,160
Pa,

117
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,519
calm down.

118
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't be stressed, okay?

119
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:07,000
Pa, listen to me.

120
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,120
Don't worry.

121
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:12,040
I already gave you a promise

122
00:08:12,399 --> 00:08:14,279
that this will stay
between the two of us.

123
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,720
But it's not just the two
of us anymore, Thom.

124
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:21,759
Nai knows about it too

125
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,959
because Da told him.

126
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,920
He and Da knew as well?

127
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,720
I'm feeling both scared and guilty.

128
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:39,960
What should I do? Is this karma?
Is that why I have to feel this way?

129
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,279
What am I going to do about this?

130
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,919
I'll call off the meeting today.

131
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,240
Let's go out.

132
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:57,279
- Thom.
- Hm?

133
00:08:57,399 --> 00:08:59,330
There's a document
for Pa to look at.

134
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,720
- Is it urgent?
- Not really.

135
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:03,039
Then put it on Pa's desk.

136
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,480
She'll look at it tomorrow.

137
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,279
We'll be going out for a bit

138
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,330
- and won't be back.
- Okay.

139
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,039
Trai, are we nearly there yet?

140
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,879
It's just up ahead.

141
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,960
You still haven't told me

142
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,559
why you asked me to
come along and see Pawinee.

143
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:25,759
She caused a rift
between Mom and Nai.

144
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,720
So I have to come
and sort it out with her.

145
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,399
Wait, Thom.

146
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,679
Trai, pull over.

147
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,240
Where are you taking me?

148
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,600
To visit that guy's family.

149
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,279
That guy?

150
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:50,840
The one I hit with my car.

151
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,039
That's right.

152
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,450
It's time for you to
do the right thing, Pa.

153
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:59,159
So it won't be
eating you up inside anymore.

154
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,240
No matter what happens,

155
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,159
I'll be there for you

156
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,519
like how I've always been.

157
00:10:12,639 --> 00:10:13,759
We're in this together,

158
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
my dear girl.

159
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,330
Come here.

160
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,120
Did Pa not come with you?

161
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,799
Do you have a message for her?

162
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,600
I can pass it on to her.

163
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,090
Please send her

164
00:10:36,279 --> 00:10:37,679
my regards.

165
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:40,600
She knows what I want
to talk to her about.

166
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:42,879
That explains it.

167
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,330
What is it?

168
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:49,480
Thom showed his jealousy
over Pawinee with my dad.

169
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,330
At first, I thought his feelings
were unreciprocated.

170
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,799
But here we are.

171
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,519
It always takes two to tango.

172
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,080
Pa.

173
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,840
Trai, drive.

174
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,480
To where?

175
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:19,600
Where do you think? Follow them.

176
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,080
- But I think...
- Go!

177
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,679
Yes, Ms. Nade.

178
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,399
I wonder where they're going.

179
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,080
We'll have to follow them
to find out.

180
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,360
Turn the car around, Trai.

181
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,240
Yes, yes.

182
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,200
Pa's having an affair?

183
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:58,759
I'm one million percent sure of it.

184
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,320
Do you remember the argument
between Pa and Nai

185
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:04,039
that Tang overheard?

186
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,120
Are you going to Dad's house?

187
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,600
You can't tell him about that!

188
00:12:11,559 --> 00:12:13,120
We've reached
a mutual understanding now.

189
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,399
I think those two might
be lying to us.

190
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,360
Nai has never engaged in any
public displays of affection.

191
00:12:22,039 --> 00:12:23,919
But why would they lie to us?

192
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,919
They probably didn't want us to ask

193
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,759
what they were arguing about.

194
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,840
I think the secret has
something to do with this.

195
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,799
Otherwise, Pa wouldn't be
so uptight about her dad knowing.

196
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,639
That might be possible.

197
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,000
For us women,

198
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,639
no matter how strong we are,

199
00:12:45,879 --> 00:12:47,759
we wouldn't want the people we love

200
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,679
to find out about
our despicable behavior.

201
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,519
And where are you right now?

202
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,399
I'm on her tail.

203
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,559
I'm going to open Nai's eyes
with proof of her promiscuity.

204
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,840
Good. Get it done.

205
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:07,960
I will, Mom.

206
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Madame.

207
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,399
I'm going to get some rest.
Don't let anyone disturb me.

208
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:23,960
Yes, Madame.

209
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,679
It was such a long time ago,
yet you haven't forgotten about it?

210
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,639
For us women,

211
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,279
no matter how strong we are,

212
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:50,360
we wouldn't want the people we love

213
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,320
to find out about
our despicable behavior.

214
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:10,120
- Pa.
- Hm?

215
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,399
Are you okay?

216
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
Yes.

217
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,440
They're heading
toward her dad's house.

218
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,399
Oh, it's getting renovated.

219
00:14:36,759 --> 00:14:40,200
Maybe Mr. Thom is taking Ms. Pa
to check on the renovations.

220
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,759
Who asked for your opinion?

221
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:45,799
Keep going after them. Step on it.

222
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,600
They're pulling over.

223
00:14:57,039 --> 00:14:58,480
Stop, Trai!

224
00:15:00,679 --> 00:15:02,200
Why did they pull over?

225
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,799
It's deserted around here.

226
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,519
And there aren't that many houses.

227
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,399
There's barely any traffic either.

228
00:15:13,799 --> 00:15:16,399
Are they into doing it
in public or something?

229
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:17,960
How could she even think that?

230
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,519
And what's your problem?

231
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,639
Because it's such
a great thought process.

232
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,440
Ordinary people wouldn't be
able to come up with that.

233
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,320
It has to be someone who's beautiful

234
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:30,480
and imaginative like you only.

235
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,159
You remember
that man's face, don't you?

236
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,120
Yes.

237
00:15:45,159 --> 00:15:47,039
I recall seeing many broken eggs
on the ground

238
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,559
when we came back to check on him.

239
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:53,080
Oh, there was also
a bottle of fish sauce.

240
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,519
It was like he just came back
from buying groceries.

241
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,320
Should we do it this way?

242
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,480
Maybe we should drive around.

243
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:04,480
We might be able to find a grocer.

244
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,440
Okay.

245
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:12,679
They're leaving! Drive!

246
00:16:12,759 --> 00:16:14,480
Nade, I think...

247
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,879
Oh.

248
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
Huh?

249
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,039
- Oh?
- Oh?

250
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,399
What's wrong with the car?

251
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,440
I don't know.
It just turned itself off.

252
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,519
Oh?

253
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,960
I don't think we'll be able
to catch up with them.

254
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:39,480
They're so lucky.

255
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:44,600
I won't let Lady Luck
be on their side, Lita.

256
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,919
Oh? Nade?

257
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,840
Nade?

258
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,840
Nade?

259
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,600
Nade?

260
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:59,159
What are you doing?

261
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:01,480
I'm hitching
a ride to go after them.

262
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,599
I need to get my hands on something
to get back at her today.

263
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,920
Hey, stop!

264
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,680
- Hey!
- Nade!

265
00:17:10,759 --> 00:17:12,279
- Stop right now!
- Nade!

266
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:13,559
- Nade, watch out!
- I'm coming with you!

267
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,410
- Watch out!
- Ms. Nade!

268
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,279
Trai,

269
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,890
you saved my life!

270
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,650
Nade, are you okay?

271
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,559
- I'm okay.
- Be careful.

272
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:41,119
Thank you, Lita.

273
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,039
Thank you.

274
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,279
I'm okay.

275
00:17:44,359 --> 00:17:45,440
Are you hurt, Ms. Nade?

276
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,680
I'm fine.

277
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:50,119
- Ms. Nade...
- Hey!

278
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,359
Are you blind?

279
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,519
Did you see me waving?
Why didn't you pull over?

280
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,319
- Did you buy your...
- Nade!

281
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,680
Don't touch me.

282
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:10,960
I'm sorry.

283
00:18:11,519 --> 00:18:12,720
I wasn't being careful enough.

284
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,039
If I can do anything as an apology,

285
00:18:16,359 --> 00:18:17,410
let me know.

286
00:18:18,119 --> 00:18:21,559
Hm... then can you drive us?
We have to tail someone.

287
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,839
No, Nade. We don't know him.

288
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,759
There are three of us.
What are you scared about, Lita?

289
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:29,000
Come on or we'll lose them.

290
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:30,650
Ow, ow, ow!

291
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,039
What's wrong, Trai?

292
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,960
My ankle hurts.

293
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,650
I might've twisted it
when we fell over just now.

294
00:18:38,279 --> 00:18:40,599
Maybe we shouldn't go now.

295
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,799
Let's figure out a plan
and try again later, okay?

296
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,000
All right.

297
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,119
- I'm not going then. Thanks anyway.
- No problem.

298
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,799
My apologies again
for almost hitting you.

299
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,410
It's okay.

300
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:56,960
All right.

301
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,039
- Where does it hurt, Trai?
- I'm okay, Nade.

302
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,410
Did he buy his license?

303
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,039
How rude.

304
00:19:10,119 --> 00:19:11,119
Nade.

305
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,839
Are you going to be okay?

306
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:19,170
Can both of you wait
for me here for a bit?

307
00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:22,440
I saw a shop over there
when we drove past.

308
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,279
I'll buy you some drinks

309
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,119
and call a mechanic.

310
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,720
But your leg is hurting.

311
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,319
I can put up with it, for your sake.

312
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,890
I'll get going. I won't be long.

313
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,319
Lita,

314
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:52,599
I already know
Trai has a crush on me.

315
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,890
But I didn't expect him
to be this crazy about me.

316
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,559
Oh?

317
00:19:59,119 --> 00:20:00,519
He has a crush on you.

318
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:02,890
Has he ever told you that?

319
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:09,960
His actions speak
louder than his words, Lita.

320
00:20:40,839 --> 00:20:41,920
Come on.

321
00:20:48,519 --> 00:20:49,839
Hello, ma'am.

322
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

323
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,039
We're looking for a good friend
we haven't seen in a while.

324
00:20:56,319 --> 00:20:59,759
Their relative was hit by a car

325
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,200
at the intersection over there

326
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:03,119
eight years ago.

327
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:06,519
Did you hear about it?

328
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,170
I just moved here
less than a year ago.

329
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,319
I'm afraid I don't know anyone.

330
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,410
What's up, Trai?

331
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,559
Hello, Mr. Nai. Call Ms. Pa
and warn her immediately.

332
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:31,079
What's going on?

333
00:21:31,170 --> 00:21:33,319
Ms. Nade is following her.
She suspects there's something

334
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,170
going on between her and Mr. Thom.

335
00:21:40,519 --> 00:21:43,119
I don't know what the nature
of their relationship is.

336
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,200
They might be dating.

337
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,410
Or they might be

338
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:50,680
trying to get it on
like Ms. Nade suspects.

339
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,960
Things might get out of hand.

340
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,799
So I stepped in

341
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,279
and pretended the car broke down.

342
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,960
So she couldn't catch up with them.

343
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:04,559
I don't know what else
those two are planning to do next.

344
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:08,599
I guess the best thing to do
is to call and warn Ms. Pa.

345
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:17,880
And do you know any grocers
who've been here for a long time?

346
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,400
I don't think so.

347
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:22,279
Uh, Thom? Excuse me for a minute.

348
00:22:27,319 --> 00:22:28,400
Hello?

349
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:29,599
Pa,

350
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,640
Trai called. He said
Nade and Lita are tailing you.

351
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:44,359
I don't see anyone.

352
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,240
He pretended
the car broke down to help you.

353
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,279
Where are you heading to with Thom?

354
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,400
Uh, well...

355
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,079
You don't have to answer me.

356
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,720
It's none of my business.

357
00:22:56,279 --> 00:22:58,240
I just called to warn you.
That's all.

358
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,519
Be careful with what you're doing
or where you're going with Thom.

359
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,319
I'm not worried about you.

360
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:06,519
I just don't want to
get roped into trouble.

361
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:19,680
- Pa.
- Yes?

362
00:23:19,759 --> 00:23:20,960
What's wrong?

363
00:23:22,119 --> 00:23:24,160
I'll tell you later.

364
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:25,920
We have to hurry back now.

365
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,359
But let's use a different route.

366
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,519
The way we came seems to be unsafe.

367
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,279
Okay.

368
00:24:09,079 --> 00:24:11,400
- Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.
- Oh, hi.

369
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:16,400
Mom,

370
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,519
so is the owner of the market
going to buy our house?

371
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,920
There's no road access
to our property.

372
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,039
And the land is tiny.
No one would want to buy it.

373
00:24:26,759 --> 00:24:27,880
Darn it.

374
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,880
I feel like spending money.

375
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:31,599
Tin,

376
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:35,000
I have to take your father to
his doctor's appointment tomorrow.

377
00:24:35,559 --> 00:24:37,480
Can you give me something
for the trip?

378
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,920
All right, all right.

379
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,440
That's all I have.

380
00:25:05,119 --> 00:25:06,240
Can I order some drinks, please?

381
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,640
What can I get you?

382
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:14,799
Can I have your chat ID
and phone number?

383
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,359
This one is honey and lemon tea.

384
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:23,400
The other one
with the heart is pink milk.

385
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,599
It's as cute as the artist
who drew it.

386
00:25:29,079 --> 00:25:30,799
Thank you.

387
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:36,200
Where can I get
the money to pay them?

388
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:04,599
I knew it.

389
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:09,319
Nadedao, Madame Nuan's daughter.

390
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:11,480
An entrepreneur and billionaire.

391
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,440
Marital status, single.

392
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,400
See you then,

393
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,160
Nadedao.

394
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,880
Trai's here.

395
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:44,359
What took you so long?

396
00:26:44,359 --> 00:26:45,680
My ankle still hurts,

397
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,319
so it took me a bit.

398
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,559
This one's yours,
honey and lemon tea.

399
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,960
Thanks.

400
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:55,079
And this one's for you, pink milk.

401
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:57,200
I remember it's your favorite drink.

402
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,960
There's a heart on it.

403
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:14,119
Oh,

404
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,440
I asked the vendor to draw it.

405
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,759
Because this one's yours.

406
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,279
What's taking the mechanic so long?

407
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,200
I'll try starting the car again.

408
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:46,000
See, Lita?

409
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:49,759
Do you see how crazy he is about me?

410
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,519
Oh?

411
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:57,440
It's just started all of a sudden.

412
00:27:58,039 --> 00:27:59,480
Should we head home then?

413
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:00,759
Great. Let's go.

414
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,400
Wait.

415
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:08,319
I can be the driver again, Ms. Lita.

416
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,559
It's okay. It's good she's driving.

417
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,680
Isn't your ankle hurting?
How are you going to drive?

418
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,160
But it's my job.

419
00:28:22,759 --> 00:28:23,960
I don't want to be a bother.

420
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,480
You're not.

421
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,759
Lita's happy to help.

422
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,640
Isn't that right, Lita?

423
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,440
Yes.

424
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,160
We're lucky Trai came to our rescue.

425
00:28:41,599 --> 00:28:45,400
I don't know what would've happened
if Nade and Lita caught up to us.

426
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,759
You're going to have
a brain aneurysm

427
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,119
before you get to divorce Nai.

428
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,240
Huh?

429
00:28:53,079 --> 00:28:55,440
You know the deal
between me and Nai?

430
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,759
My dad told you, didn't he?

431
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,279
Mm.

432
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,559
Darn it, Dad.

433
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,480
But don't worry.

434
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,279
I won't tell anyone

435
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:14,359
you decided to marry Nai

436
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:15,960
to take revenge on Madame Nuan.

437
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,720
- Mm.
- And not because of love.

438
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,200
Okay.

439
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,640
I trust you anyway.

440
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,839
But I think

441
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,720
Madame's already found out about us.

442
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,240
And she's probably trying to
get us into trouble.

443
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:36,680
I'd like to pretend to be
all over you just to mess with her.

444
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,720
So she'd think

445
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,759
I'm making a fool of her son.

446
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:52,759
Hello?

447
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,160
I'm about to go home.

448
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,680
Thom's giving you a lift, isn't he?

449
00:29:58,599 --> 00:29:59,960
I'm almost home now.

450
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,720
I'll stop at the front.
We'll head inside together.

451
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:03,960
That's not necessary.

452
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,759
It'll be a while until I'm home.

453
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,000
Why?

454
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:11,319
Are you worried your mom might
try to catch me and Thom?

455
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,640
I'm worried you might pull a prank
just to mess with everyone.

456
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,640
That's one thing you can be sure of.

457
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,599
So your mom can be reminded of how
good of daughter-in-law Da was.

458
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,240
You're saying all this
in Thom's presence.

459
00:30:23,599 --> 00:30:25,359
Does that mean
he's found out about us?

460
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:27,440
That's right.

461
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,279
He knows everything.

462
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,799
Can I talk to him?

463
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,000
Why?

464
00:30:32,079 --> 00:30:33,680
It's none of your business.

465
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,400
Thom, Nai wants a word.

466
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:47,000
Yes, Nai? What's the matter?

467
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:49,880
About my sister
following you and Pa,

468
00:30:50,519 --> 00:30:52,240
I'm worried Pa won't let it go.

469
00:30:53,359 --> 00:30:56,079
Even if I try to stop her,
I don't think she'll listen.

470
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,799
So I'd like to ask
a favor of you instead.

471
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,720
If she asks you to cooperate,

472
00:31:02,079 --> 00:31:03,920
please don't help her.

473
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:06,559
I don't want anyone
to think of her negatively.

474
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,599
I feel sorry for her.

475
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:12,119
She's been through enough already.

476
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:15,359
Let's not make
her feel worse than this.

477
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:17,920
Don't worry, Nai.

478
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,559
I love and mean well for Pa
even more than you.

479
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:24,400
And I'll look after her
and defend her reputation.

480
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,720
How come you're driving, Ms. Lita?

481
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,279
- Jai.
- Yes?

482
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:55,200
Stop paying attention to Lita.

483
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,960
Come and help bring Trai inside.

484
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,400
- What's the matter with him?
- He hurt his ankle.

485
00:31:59,839 --> 00:32:01,400
- Ah!
- Ouch!

486
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:04,000
Hey, be careful!

487
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,599
Are you okay, Trai?
Here. I'll give you a hand.

488
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,039
Take it slow.

489
00:32:08,319 --> 00:32:09,640
All right.

490
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,839
Help him!

491
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,119
Does your leg hurt?

492
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,240
Do we have a wheelchair here?

493
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,079
- Can you go and get it?
- Okay, I will.

494
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:17,359
I can walk, Ms. Nade.

495
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,640
Oh, hang on.

496
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,440
- Uncle Phol.
- Yes?

497
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,559
- Take over from me.
- Of course.

498
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,519
Actually,

499
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:32,799
I want to escort you
to your room myself.

500
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,319
But it might be inappropriate.

501
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:39,440
Very inappropriate.

502
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,680
I'll let Jai and Uncle Phol
take me there.

503
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:43,880
All right. Let's get going.

504
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:45,799
What have you been up to?

505
00:32:46,359 --> 00:32:48,799
Be careful next time, okay?

506
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,599
Cute.

507
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:55,279
That's enough for today.
I need to go and see Mom.

508
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:57,160
Thanks.

509
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,640
How did it go?
Did you find anything?

510
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:04,839
Luck was on her side today.

511
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:06,880
The car broke down,
so we couldn't catch up.

512
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,680
But we have

513
00:33:09,839 --> 00:33:13,160
evidence of her promiscuity.

514
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:15,519
What evidence?

515
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,039
Should I have it printed
and distribute it to the public?

516
00:33:56,599 --> 00:33:58,079
Not just yet.

517
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,799
Don't you think there's something
going on between them?

518
00:34:03,119 --> 00:34:04,799
It's not that I don't think so.

519
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:09,719
But the evidence isn't tight enough
to do something to Pawinee.

520
00:34:10,289 --> 00:34:13,519
Ms. Pa might sue you
for slander as well.

521
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:14,719
That's right.

522
00:34:14,769 --> 00:34:17,559
Pa is eviler than we think.

523
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,559
If we want to cause her trouble,

524
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,769
we have to find stronger evidence.

525
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,440
Let me know
if I can be of help, Auntie.

526
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,039
Thanks so much, Lita.

527
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:30,960
Come on, Mom!

528
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:34,679
I got a video!
Aren't you even going to use it?

529
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:39,440
Who says I'm not going to?

530
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:43,079
Mr. Nai.

531
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:47,769
Madame asked to see you
as soon as you got home.

532
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,679
- Hey!
- Huh?

533
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,199
- Auntie Erb didn't cook any food!
- Oh?

534
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,039
What am I going to eat?

535
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,039
Fish sauce, it is.

536
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,360
- Wait, wait, wait!
- What?

537
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,719
I'm starving. Let me eat first.

538
00:35:04,809 --> 00:35:06,809
Sompit! Tang!

539
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,159
Madame said to bring
the fruit upstairs now.

540
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:11,769
What?

541
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,809
I just brought refreshments over.
Aren't they enough already?

542
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,559
Oh, is that the issue at hand?

543
00:35:16,639 --> 00:35:18,329
No worries. I'll go and ask.

544
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,840
Hang on, Jai! Don't do that.

545
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,519
- We'll be out of jobs!
- Right!

546
00:35:22,519 --> 00:35:23,599
- Let's go!
- Indeed.

547
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,400
Hi, Nai.

548
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:31,809
Hey.

549
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:34,079
Have a seat, Nai.

550
00:35:34,159 --> 00:35:35,159
It's okay.

551
00:35:36,199 --> 00:35:38,079
Did you want to see me?

552
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,159
Where are Sompit and Tang
and the fruit?

553
00:35:42,639 --> 00:35:44,119
It's okay, Mom.

554
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,719
I don't feel like any just yet.

555
00:35:46,809 --> 00:35:48,599
I'd rather talk to you.

556
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,360
Excuse me, Madame.

557
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,119
Right on time.

558
00:35:55,519 --> 00:35:57,159
Pick up the pace.

559
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,769
My son's hungry.

560
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,719
He had a long day at work.

561
00:36:01,679 --> 00:36:04,360
All right, Nade.
What did you find today?

562
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,039
Tell him.

563
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,119
Oh, okay.

564
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:12,880
Lita and I went out for lunch today.

565
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,000
And we remembered Pawinee's
company is also close by.

566
00:36:17,079 --> 00:36:19,239
So we thought we'd buy
her some snacks.

567
00:36:20,199 --> 00:36:21,289
And I saw

568
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,519
something awful.

569
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:25,960
I don't want to say it.
You can see it for yourself.

570
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:42,119
Whoa!

571
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,239
And they got into a car
and drove away.

572
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,960
They seemed

573
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:53,769
very sweet with each other

574
00:36:53,809 --> 00:36:55,679
too much to the point that...

575
00:36:56,599 --> 00:36:57,639
they might be lovers.

576
00:36:58,679 --> 00:36:59,719
- Lovers?
- Lovers?

577
00:36:59,809 --> 00:37:01,199
You two,

578
00:37:01,769 --> 00:37:03,239
watch your mouth.

579
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:07,559
Pawinee is my daughter-in-law
no matter what.

580
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:11,079
- I'm sorry, Madame.
- I'm sorry, Madame.

581
00:37:11,289 --> 00:37:12,480
Leave us.

582
00:37:13,639 --> 00:37:15,329
And remember,

583
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,599
whatever you've heard in this room,

584
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:19,360
keep this to yourself.

585
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,559
Don't tell anyone else.

586
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,769
- Yes, Madame.
- Yes, Madame.

587
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:48,329
Tang, did you see Ms. Pa
kissing someone else?

588
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,809
Of course!

589
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:53,000
It's unbelievable.
She's actually got some moves.

590
00:37:53,719 --> 00:37:54,960
Who's got some moves?

591
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,719
So we tailed them

592
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,289
because I wanted to know
if what I saw was for real.

593
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,809
But we were unlucky
because the car broke down.

594
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:14,480
So we couldn't keep going.

595
00:38:15,639 --> 00:38:16,960
Pa called me.

596
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,920
She said they were going to talk to
the contractor at her dad's house.

597
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:22,719
And did she tell you why

598
00:38:22,809 --> 00:38:25,679
she was being all mopey
and needed this guy to comfort her?

599
00:38:25,769 --> 00:38:28,000
Please don't misunderstand this.

600
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:30,289
There's nothing between them.

601
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,840
They're close

602
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,679
because they've known each other
since they were young.

603
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,119
I didn't misjudge them as lovers.

604
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,360
But the major problem
at hand is her behavior.

605
00:38:42,199 --> 00:38:46,289
She should remember
she's already married.

606
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:50,400
She shouldn't act too friendly
with another man in public.

607
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:54,400
Maybe she spent
too much time overseas

608
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:58,769
and forgot how much
Thai people love to gossip?

609
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,199
Especially when it comes to spouses.

610
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,440
Huh?

611
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:07,480
Could Ms. Pa actually be unfaithful?

612
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:09,809
A million percent possibility.

613
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,400
There's evidence.

614
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:13,679
But don't tell anyone else, okay?

615
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:17,639
- Now that you know it, zip it.
- Zip it?

616
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,289
Zip it?

617
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,960
Zip it.

618
00:39:21,769 --> 00:39:23,159
Erb! Erb!

619
00:39:23,329 --> 00:39:24,920
I have something to tell you.

620
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,559
But zip it once I've told you, okay?

621
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:32,960
Zip it once I've told you, okay?

622
00:39:34,769 --> 00:39:35,809
- Dao!
- Huh?

623
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,809
- I need to tell you something.
- What?

624
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,159
Zip it once I've told you, okay?

625
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:40,329
What?

626
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,199
Step on what?

627
00:39:42,289 --> 00:39:43,639
What's going on?

628
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:47,119
How are you going to fix
Pawinee's behavior?

629
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,880
I'll remind her.

630
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,079
Not just that.

631
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:53,039
You need to have
a serious talk with your wife

632
00:39:53,239 --> 00:39:55,769
and remind her
we're not a regular family.

633
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:58,239
Public image and reputation
are important to us.

634
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,679
She can't just do
whatever she wants.

635
00:40:00,769 --> 00:40:02,440
Where is everyone?

636
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:03,599
That's Ms. Pa's father's voice.

637
00:40:04,159 --> 00:40:05,199
Where are you?

638
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,079
What?

639
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,289
Huh? Where are you?

640
00:40:12,679 --> 00:40:14,199
Oh, you're here.

641
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,119
What is going on here?

642
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:22,079
These are toilet cleaning supplies.

643
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:25,809
They're for anyone accusing
my daughter of having an affair.

644
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,840
Use them to clean your mouth.

645
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:31,079
Otherwise, spend your money
on expensive furniture

646
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:33,519
or dog food

647
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,440
so the dogs will
stay out of your mouth!

648
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,559
Rude.

649
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:40,599
Rude.

650
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:42,719
At least I'm better than those
with filthy minds

651
00:40:42,809 --> 00:40:45,719
who make empty accusations
of other people.

652
00:40:45,809 --> 00:40:46,880
I never make
empty accusations of anyone.

653
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,239
- Right!
- Nade, please.

654
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:53,769
Father, there was
a misunderstanding.

655
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,920
No one thinks that
Pa is having an affair.

656
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,960
Don't try to defend your sister.

657
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:01,769
Everyone here knows
what she talks about my daughter.

658
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:05,000
I'd love to give you a smack
on behalf of your mother.

659
00:41:05,079 --> 00:41:06,440
Do you think you have the guts?

660
00:41:06,519 --> 00:41:08,329
Oh, are you challenging me?

661
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,769
Do you think I don't have the guts?

662
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,199
If you do, then bring it on.

663
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:13,719
- Bring it on!
- All right!

664
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,440
- Do you think I don't?
- Bring it on!

665
00:41:15,519 --> 00:41:17,199
Come over here then!

666
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:21,960
Come here! You should
learn to keep your mouth shut!

667
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,599
Watch your mouth!
Why are you running away?

668
00:41:25,679 --> 00:41:26,679
Stop right there!

669
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:28,079
Stay still.

670
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:30,079
Where do you think you're going?

671
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,000
Where are you going? Stop!

672
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:33,119
Don't think you can get away!

673
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,159
What is this?

674
00:41:35,239 --> 00:41:37,519
What are you doing?

675
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:40,289
Do you understand
what I told you now?

676
00:41:47,039 --> 00:41:50,480
You meant for Pa's dad
to cause a scene?

677
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,360
That's right.

678
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:54,769
So Nai realizes

679
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:57,559
how disruptive Pawineee
and her father's actions are

680
00:41:57,679 --> 00:41:59,679
to our family.

681
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,920
And why didn't you
tell me in advance?

682
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:08,719
I could help egg him on
and show more of his true colors.

683
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,440
It's okay.

684
00:42:10,519 --> 00:42:13,199
This is already more than enough.

685
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,719
Oh, Nick?

686
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,239
Coming! Coming!

687
00:42:33,769 --> 00:42:35,769
Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

688
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:39,119
Here I am. Oh, what's
with the waterworks?

689
00:42:39,199 --> 00:42:43,199
There, there. It's okay. Calm down.

690
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,559
I'm here now.

691
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:56,400
I'm worried you might pull a prank
just to mess with everyone.

692
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,519
Don't worry, Nai.

693
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:00,480
That's one thing you can be sure of.

694
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,289
Not just that.

695
00:43:02,519 --> 00:43:05,159
You need to have
a serious talk with your wife

696
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,920
and remind her
we're not a regular family.

697
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:10,480
Public image and reputation
are important to us.

698
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,809
These are toilet cleaning supplies.

699
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,480
They're for anyone accusing
my daughter of having an affair.

700
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:18,400
Use them to clean your mouth.

701
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,119
Come on. Let's go outside.

702
00:43:39,639 --> 00:43:42,639
Nick saw you walk by
and started crying.

703
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

704
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,639
Come here. Come to Daddy.

705
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:54,559
- I'll take it over from here.
- Oh, okay.

706
00:43:54,639 --> 00:43:55,840
Here's a cloth.

707
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:01,840
There, there.

708
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,880
They're your family.

709
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:28,159
I have to be patient

710
00:44:29,719 --> 00:44:31,119
and make them love each other

711
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:36,880
so you can have a loving family.

712
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,199
And Mommy won't have to worry.

713
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:56,159
Yeesh!

714
00:44:56,599 --> 00:44:57,880
These people...

715
00:45:01,159 --> 00:45:02,159
Dad,

716
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:04,880
Jai said you got into a fight
with Ms. Nade.

717
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,960
How are you doing?

718
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,719
I'm physically fine.

719
00:45:08,199 --> 00:45:09,760
But mentally, I'm worked up.

720
00:45:10,039 --> 00:45:11,800
Was she born without a filter?

721
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,000
She accused you of having
an affair with Thom.

722
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,920
Yeesh.

723
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,320
Forget it, Dad.

724
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,199
Calm down.
She's just blabbing as usual.

725
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:26,679
Where's Nick?

726
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:28,199
He's with Mr. Nai.

727
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:32,679
But I wonder what's gotten into him.
He seems very sad.

728
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:38,400
Pa,

729
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,280
I thought you said you were
going to forget about him.

730
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:41,760
So why would you give him attention?

731
00:45:43,159 --> 00:45:44,280
Forget him?

732
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,159
Why would you forget him?

733
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:51,679
Uh, well...

734
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,639
Don't tell me

735
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,159
you've actually
fallen in love with him.

736
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,960
No, she hasn't!
It's just a small crush.

737
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:06,800
This tiny.

738
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:09,079
It'll go away eventually.

739
00:46:09,159 --> 00:46:10,239
Is that right, Pa?

740
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:13,679
- Oh, yes. You're right, Dad.
- Right.

741
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,599
I don't even know
why I have a crush on him.

742
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,760
I was going to tell my dad
about that this morning.

743
00:46:24,039 --> 00:46:27,239
But then I found out
about his heart condition,

744
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,000
so I lied to him

745
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,320
and said that

746
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:35,679
I was starting to
have feelings for Nai.

747
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:40,360
So you're saying

748
00:46:41,079 --> 00:46:43,159
you don't have feelings for him?

749
00:46:44,159 --> 00:46:46,039
Of course not!

750
00:46:46,599 --> 00:46:48,960
He's the son of the woman
who basically killed my sister!

751
00:46:49,239 --> 00:46:50,800
How can I fall for him?

752
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:55,320
I don't want anyone
to think of her negatively.

753
00:46:56,199 --> 00:46:57,480
I feel sorry for her.

754
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:01,000
She's been through enough already.

755
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:04,239
Let's not make
her feel worse than this.

756
00:47:07,559 --> 00:47:12,119
You don't have feelings for him,
or you don't know how you feel?

757
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:15,800
Why are you asking me that?

758
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:20,079
Nothing. I was just asking.

759
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:22,400
Ms. Pa.

760
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:24,199
Yes?

761
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:25,880
Excuse me, Mr. Thom.

762
00:47:26,239 --> 00:47:27,440
Mr. Nai would like to see you.

763
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:30,039
Did he say why?

764
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:31,599
No, he didn't.

765
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:34,679
But his mood doesn't seem
to have improved much.

766
00:47:35,239 --> 00:47:37,079
Uh... well then.

767
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:40,119
I'll see you off here, Thom.

768
00:47:40,719 --> 00:47:42,320
- I have to go.
- Okay.

769
00:47:44,599 --> 00:47:45,679
Bye.

770
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,519
Is that someone without feelings?

771
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,079
Hey.

772
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,159
What are you waiting for?

773
00:48:11,679 --> 00:48:13,280
I'm waiting for my driver.

774
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,679
How long will that be?

775
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,400
I can give you a lift
if it's going to be a while.

776
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,679
Has Thom left?

777
00:48:35,039 --> 00:48:36,039
Yes.

778
00:48:37,079 --> 00:48:39,079
Why did you want to see me?
What's the matter?

779
00:48:39,639 --> 00:48:41,280
I'm sorry on behalf of my family

780
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:43,599
for the misunderstanding

781
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,440
about you having an affair.

782
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,960
Okay.

783
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:54,199
Dao's already told me

784
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:56,119
no one believes a word of that

785
00:48:56,280 --> 00:49:00,280
because everyone knows your sister
has an imaginative mind.

786
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,159
So why did you let Thom kiss
your protruding forehead?

787
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,679
Did you just say I have
a protruding forehead?

788
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:09,639
Don't try and change the topic.

789
00:49:11,639 --> 00:49:12,639
Well...

790
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:15,239
Um...

791
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,960
I was upset about that.

792
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,639
So Thom tried to cheer me up

793
00:49:23,239 --> 00:49:26,719
like when we were younger.

794
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,880
Don't forget
that you're not a kid anymore.

795
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:31,039
You're a grown-up now

796
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:33,159
and already have a husband.

797
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:35,639
I know.

798
00:49:37,159 --> 00:49:39,000
I'll be more careful next time.

799
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,199
Now that's a good girl.

800
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:55,960
If there's nothing else,
I'll be going now.

801
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,679
Pa,

802
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:02,840
should we get a divorce?

803
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,920
So things don't
get too out of control.

804
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,840
What do you mean by "things"?

805
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,960
Well,

806
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,519
everything.

807
00:50:15,079 --> 00:50:16,440
I told you

808
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,360
I won't get a divorce

809
00:50:18,679 --> 00:50:21,039
until I get what I want.

810
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:23,639
And are you sure

811
00:50:24,119 --> 00:50:27,119
you won't end up in agony
if you stay with me?

812
00:50:27,679 --> 00:50:28,679
Agony?

813
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,519
Why would I end up in agony?

814
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,760
Thom?

815
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:38,280
Just forget it.

816
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,840
Tell me what you mean now.

817
00:50:49,239 --> 00:50:50,800
If you don't tell me,

818
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,119
I'm going to

819
00:50:53,199 --> 00:50:57,199
let Thom hug and kiss me publicly

820
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,880
so your mom can die of shock.

821
00:50:59,039 --> 00:51:01,119
If you're not afraid of being
involved a scandalous affair

822
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:03,920
until your neighbors gossip
about you and humiliate your dad,

823
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:06,119
then go ahead.

824
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:11,800
Tell me now!

825
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,840
Are you a cop?

826
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,079
It's not the time to joke around!

827
00:51:17,159 --> 00:51:19,039
- You want to play rough?
- Mm!

828
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:20,239
All right.

829
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,000
Do you think you're the only one
who knows how to do this?

830
00:51:36,239 --> 00:51:37,559
- Hey!
- Do you think you're so tough?

831
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,000
I could deplete you of
all your strength, you know?

832
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:40,880
What are you going to do?

833
00:51:42,159 --> 00:51:44,079
Nai!

834
00:51:44,199 --> 00:51:45,920
Nai!

835
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:47,519
What should I do?

836
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,280
I'm not afraid of whatever
you're going to do.

837
00:51:50,840 --> 00:51:52,320
Why are you so boastful?

838
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,760
Try me if you don't believe me.

839
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,920
I'm going to call for dad.
You'll lose your head for sure.

840
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,480
Before that happens,

841
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:01,960
I'm worried you might
lose your mind first.

842
00:52:02,679 --> 00:52:05,480
Ew, you narcissist!

843
00:52:08,639 --> 00:52:10,119
Don't, Nai!

844
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:18,920
You don't have to ask me

845
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:21,800
what I meant.

846
00:52:23,559 --> 00:52:25,159
Just ask your own heart.

847
00:52:39,639 --> 00:52:41,519
That's an accusation.

848
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,400
Why would I tell him
you have a crush on him?

849
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:54,960
If you didn't say it,

850
00:52:57,960 --> 00:52:59,760
then what was he talking about?

851
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:02,239
Pa,

852
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,079
should we do it this way?

853
00:53:04,679 --> 00:53:06,880
I'll ask Orn to bring
over the shotgun tomorrow.

854
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,519
Then I'll try and squeeze out
the truth from him.

855
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:10,639
- Okay?
- Hey!

856
00:53:10,719 --> 00:53:12,639
Dad, there's no need!

857
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:14,199
Then don't overthink it.

858
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,199
He might just be saying things.

859
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,679
Spend your time thinking
about Thom instead

860
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,719
so you can forget about Nai.

861
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:43,480
(Have you started trying to get
information from him, Lita?)

862
00:53:43,519 --> 00:53:46,480
Have you started trying to get
information from him, Lita?

863
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,599
I'd like to ask you something.

864
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:58,800
Of course.

865
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:01,519
You and Pa

866
00:54:02,039 --> 00:54:03,960
seem very close.

867
00:54:05,199 --> 00:54:06,599
Have you known each other long?

868
00:54:06,679 --> 00:54:09,199
Da and Pa were my playmates

869
00:54:09,639 --> 00:54:11,519
ever since I was little.

870
00:54:11,639 --> 00:54:13,239
Oh.

871
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,639
That's nice.

872
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,480
Since you're this close,

873
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:21,440
aren't you keen
on dating each other?

874
00:54:23,719 --> 00:54:26,760
You're trying to find out
about me and Pa, aren't you?

875
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,480
No!

876
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:30,639
That's a lie.

877
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:33,800
I know

878
00:54:34,199 --> 00:54:37,599
you're the woman Madame wants as
her in-law rather than Da and Pa.

879
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,599
And I also know you want her to be
your mother-in-law as well.

880
00:54:44,199 --> 00:54:49,159
That's why you helped Nade
tail me and Pa earlier today.

881
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:53,760
You knew

882
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:55,960
Nade and I were...

883
00:54:56,039 --> 00:54:58,239
Mm. Of course.

884
00:54:58,679 --> 00:55:01,360
And I know you tailed us

885
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,920
to the intersection
near Pa's Dad's house.

886
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,760
But unfortunately,
the car broke down.

887
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:08,400
So you couldn't keep following us.

888
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:15,119
Lita,

889
00:55:16,159 --> 00:55:19,559
I'm not going to criticize you
for trying to take Nai away from Pa.

890
00:55:19,639 --> 00:55:20,920
But I'm only asking for one thing.

891
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,480
Don't you ever hurt Pa.

892
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,119
You seem to care a lot about her.

893
00:55:32,239 --> 00:55:34,320
Huh? Maybe

894
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,840
you want to steal
someone else's wife as well?

895
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,079
Don't assume
that I'm the same as you.

896
00:55:41,159 --> 00:55:43,760
- Oh? Wasn't I right?
- Absolutely not.

897
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:47,639
The connection
I have with Pa is innocent.

898
00:55:48,159 --> 00:55:50,360
It's not a match made based on

899
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:54,599
money and fake social status
like between you and Nai.

900
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:02,480
I'm getting out.
Can you please unlock the door?

901
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:05,480
It's difficult
to find a ride around here.

902
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:10,480
The light's about
to go green as well.

903
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:12,159
Unlock the door.

904
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:14,920
Come on. Since we're
carpooling together,

905
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,079
you can put up with me
for a little bit longer.

906
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:22,559
If Mr. Singkorn finds out I dropped
off his daughter at an intersection,

907
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,440
he might get angry

908
00:56:25,079 --> 00:56:26,360
and cancel my work contract.

909
00:56:45,719 --> 00:56:46,760
Lita,

910
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:51,800
I gave you a lift home.
Aren't you going to thank me?

911
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,119
Mom,

912
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,639
Lita just called.

913
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,880
She said Thom admitted he knows

914
00:57:13,039 --> 00:57:15,639
Nade and I were following them.

915
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,079
So that meant even if
the car hadn't broken down,

916
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:22,360
they were trying to lure me away
so I couldn't follow them.

917
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:25,960
That might be the case.

918
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:27,440
Should we

919
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:30,599
hire someone to spy on them?

920
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:33,800
I believe we'll find
some good evidence.

921
00:57:34,360 --> 00:57:37,280
You're always one step behind me.

922
00:57:37,840 --> 00:57:39,320
What do you mean?

923
00:57:40,599 --> 00:57:41,599
Just forget it.

924
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,000
You can go now.

925
00:57:53,079 --> 00:57:54,639
Mom,

926
00:57:55,039 --> 00:57:56,840
I'm here for a reward.

927
00:57:57,800 --> 00:58:00,440
What do you want? Just tell Tom
to handle it for you.

928
00:58:00,519 --> 00:58:03,440
But I need your permission
for this one.

929
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:04,559
What is it?

930
00:58:04,639 --> 00:58:07,159
Trai saved my life today,

931
00:58:07,239 --> 00:58:09,079
so I'd like to thank him.

932
00:58:10,119 --> 00:58:13,000
You can do whatever you want.
Just leave already.

933
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:33,639
What?

934
00:58:33,719 --> 00:58:35,199
I'm inside, Madame.

935
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,840
Get inside Pa's bedroom

936
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,360
and search the whole place.

937
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:40,599
I'm sure there must be

938
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:43,920
some kind of secret
about her and Thomtawee

939
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:46,079
I can use against her.

940
00:58:46,639 --> 00:58:47,639
Yes, Madame.

941
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,920
Please be on my side, Lady Luck.

942
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:11,280
(CKV Photo Digital)

943
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:37,039
(I'm sorry.)

944
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,400
(I'm sorry.)

945
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:41,719
(I'm sorry.)

(I'm sorry.
Thom, without you today,)

947
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,760
(I might've gotten so depressed)

948
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,519
(that I killed myself.)

949
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,199
(Thom, without you today,)

950

that I killed myself.)

(I might've gotten so depressed
that I killed myself.)

954
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:35,480
These two are definitely
hiding something.

955
01:00:46,239 --> 01:00:48,280
This one's too sexy.

956
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,480
I don't think Trai would like it.

957
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:10,719
Hello?

958
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:12,000
Who's that?

959
01:01:12,159 --> 01:01:13,239
I'm Tin,

960
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,360
the guy who almost
hit you with a car.

961
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:18,039
Oh, I remember you!

962
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:21,239
Where did you get my number?

963
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,119
It's so serendipitous.

964
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:26,559
I know someone who has your number.

965
01:01:26,719 --> 01:01:28,159
I'm calling you

966
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,360
because I'd like to
apologize to you.

967
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:31,960
I was reckless

968
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:34,039
and almost seriously hurt you.

969
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:36,679
Okay. Anyway, I have to go.

970
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:38,880
Wait.

971
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:41,599
What now?

972
01:01:41,679 --> 01:01:42,840
As an apology,

973
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:46,519
can I treat you to dinner?

974
01:01:46,639 --> 01:01:48,920
Are you calling to
make a move on me?

975
01:01:50,320 --> 01:01:51,760
I'm sorry,

976
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:53,920
but I'm not single anymore.

977
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,840
And I'm not ready for a side piece

978
01:01:56,920 --> 01:02:00,239
because the guy I've got
is very lovely.

979
01:02:01,639 --> 01:02:03,239
Don't call me again.

980
01:02:08,559 --> 01:02:09,599
Good.

981
01:02:10,559 --> 01:02:12,079
I enjoy women

982
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:14,079
who play hard-to-get.

Thom,

984
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:25,079
Kookkai and Jackie have agreed to
do the commercial with us.

As for Madame Nuan,

986
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:31,800
she turned us down like Pa expected.

987
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,119
Does Pa know about this?

988
01:02:33,199 --> 01:02:34,559
She hasn't arrived yet.

989
01:02:34,639 --> 01:02:36,679
She said she's taking her dad
to see the doctor.

990
01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:40,639
Thom,

991
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:42,840
- you have a guest.
- Who is it?

992
01:02:44,079 --> 01:02:45,079
Whoa!

993
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:48,079
- Hello.
- Hello.

994
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,320
My apologies

995
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,079
for showing up unannounced.

996
01:02:55,159 --> 01:02:56,920
Oh, it's not a problem at all.

997
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:59,000
I was a bit impatient.

998
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:02,920
I wanted Tom to come
and apologize to you in person.

999
01:03:03,519 --> 01:03:05,039
For what, Madame?

1000
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,320
Well,

1001
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,559
I'd like to apologize

1002
01:03:08,679 --> 01:03:12,519
for turning down your proposal
when your team contacted us.

1003
01:03:13,079 --> 01:03:15,119
I assumed

1004
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:18,199
Madame would say no.

1005
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:20,199
But as soon as she found out,

1006
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,960
she said yes.

1007
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,440
Does that mean

1008
01:03:24,679 --> 01:03:26,719
you're agreeing to
work with us, Madame?

1009
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:30,679
Well, it's a commercial
that empowers women.

1010
01:03:31,159 --> 01:03:32,840
Why would I turn it down?

1011
01:03:34,159 --> 01:03:35,599
Thank you very much, Madame.

1012
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,679
But there's one condition.

1013
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:39,880
Yes?

1014
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,880
According to the details
your team sent us,

1015
01:03:41,960 --> 01:03:45,440
it seems you'd like to film her life
up close and personal.

1016
01:03:45,880 --> 01:03:48,400
I'm afraid we can't facilitate that.

1017
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:53,880
We're only requesting to do so
for three days.

1018
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:55,000
I'm afraid that's not possible.

1019
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,199
Madame has a very tight schedule.

1020
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:02,119
She has her job
and has to go to various places.

1021
01:04:02,199 --> 01:04:04,159
And it might be
uncomfortable for her

1022
01:04:04,239 --> 01:04:06,400
to be around strangers.

1023
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,679
But...

1024
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:10,880
It'd be great if
we could have someone

1025
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:14,960
who's close to her like Ms. Pawinee.

1026
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:18,360
Pa?

1027
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,599
That's right.

1028
01:04:20,039 --> 01:04:22,639
The only person I'll give permission
to follow me around

1029
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:25,239
is my daughter-in-law.

1030
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:33,960
Madame,

1031
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:36,320
you only want Ms. Pa
to be in your vicinity

1032
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,719
so you can find out more
about both of them?

1033
01:04:46,800 --> 01:04:49,400
No, I'm not doing it.

1034
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,280
It's obvious
what she's planning to do.

1035
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:59,280
Pa, but if we get to collaborate
with Madame Nuan,

1036
01:04:59,360 --> 01:05:01,599
it'll add a lot of value to our job.

1037
01:05:01,679 --> 01:05:04,280
But she doesn't intend
to collaborate.

1038
01:05:04,360 --> 01:05:07,880
She might actually bail on us
all of a sudden.

1039
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:09,840
Then we'd all be in trouble.

1040
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:13,840
Well then.

1041
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:15,800
It's up to you to decide.

1042
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:35,599
Mr. Nai?

1043
01:05:36,480 --> 01:05:37,719
- Hello.
- Hello.

1044
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:39,519
- Are you here to see Pa?
- Yes.

1045
01:05:39,679 --> 01:05:40,679
Come on in.

1046
01:05:42,119 --> 01:05:43,320
It's a shame, Pern.

1047
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:46,000
Our job would be awesome
if we got Madame Nuan with us.

1048
01:05:46,199 --> 01:05:48,000
Should we ask Thom

1049
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:51,039
to negotiate with her and have
someone else instead of Pa?

1050
01:05:51,360 --> 01:05:54,599
But Madame insisted
it has to be her.

1051
01:05:54,679 --> 01:05:56,039
Hey!

1052
01:05:59,239 --> 01:06:00,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

1053
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:01,519
Hello.

1054
01:06:01,519 --> 01:06:02,800
Are you here for Pa?

1055
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:05,719
- Yes, I'm driving her home.
- I see.

1056
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:08,880
Can you please tell her?
I'll wait out front.

1057
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:10,760
Of course.

1058
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:16,760
Do you reckon he heard us
gossiping about his mom?

1059
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,400
It doesn't matter if he did.

1060
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,000
We didn't say anything awful.

1061
01:06:22,639 --> 01:06:24,119
Yes, Nai?

1062
01:06:24,320 --> 01:06:26,960
About you wanting Pa to tag along
to collect information,

1063
01:06:27,840 --> 01:06:29,400
you're not planning
something, are you?

1064
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,840
Why are you asking me that?

1065
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,480
I can't come up with any reason

1066
01:06:33,639 --> 01:06:35,920
why you'd want her
to be close to you.

1067
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,639
It's all about work.

1068
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:40,320
But you're not fond of her.

1069
01:06:40,679 --> 01:06:43,840
I'm professional enough. I can keep
private matters separate.

1070
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:45,360
And I hope

1071
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:49,039
Pawinee can be professional too.

1072
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:50,599
Okay.

1073
01:06:53,119 --> 01:06:54,519
Nai,

1074
01:06:55,320 --> 01:06:56,599
why would you come and pick me up?

1075
01:06:57,199 --> 01:06:59,480
People are still gossiping
about that affair,

1076
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:02,559
so I have to act
like a good husband.

1077
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:05,119
- Really?
- Mm.

1078
01:07:08,639 --> 01:07:10,599
You have to accept the job
and follow my mom around.

1079
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,519
News sure gets around fast.

1080
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:15,039
Then I'd like to ask you

1081
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:17,159
why you want me to accept this job.

1082
01:07:18,960 --> 01:07:21,760
Because I want you and Mom
to be in close proximity

1083
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,840
so you can get to
know each other better

1084
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:26,840
and all the prejudices
in your heart can go away.

1085
01:07:28,440 --> 01:07:30,719
I think we'd kill each other

1086
01:07:30,800 --> 01:07:33,000
if we were in close proximity.

1087
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:36,199
You have to accept the job.

1088
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:38,239
And you have no right
to order me around.

1089
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:41,320
Have you forgotten about our deal?

1090
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:44,159
You gave me a promise

1091
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:48,039
that if I can convince your dad
to come and live at my house,

1092
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,079
you're going to let me do anything.

1093
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:51,960
Let your dad stay at my house

1094
01:07:52,519 --> 01:07:53,960
while the house
is being rebuilt, Pa.

1095
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:55,519
You're saying as if my dad's
going to agree on that.

1096
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:56,840
What if I can convince him?

1097
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:00,880
Are you willing to get to know
my mother if I convince your father?

1098
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,559
- How exactly?
- Do we have ourselves a deal?

1099
01:08:03,760 --> 01:08:04,800
It's a deal.

1100
01:08:15,159 --> 01:08:17,239
Honorable people
never break their promises.

1101
01:08:19,159 --> 01:08:20,159
All right.

1102
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,359
I'll accept the job.

1103
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,609
But first, you have to tell me

1104
01:08:28,039 --> 01:08:29,920
what you meant last night

1105
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:32,840
about me being in agony

1106
01:08:33,649 --> 01:08:34,680
if I don't divorce you.

1107
01:08:35,569 --> 01:08:36,880
Should we divorce?

1108
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:38,159
I'm not going to

1109
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:40,720
until I get what I want.

1110
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:43,399
And are you sure

1111
01:08:43,840 --> 01:08:45,359
you won't end up in agony

1112
01:08:45,529 --> 01:08:47,039
if you stay with me?

1113
01:08:49,039 --> 01:08:50,920
I'll tell you

1114
01:08:51,529 --> 01:08:52,680
once your job with my mom is over.

1115
01:09:10,359 --> 01:09:11,960
I was pregnant.

1116
01:09:12,529 --> 01:09:13,840
I need you

1117
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:16,239
to teach my daughter-in-law
a lesson.

1118
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:23,720
My mother took your phone?

1119
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,720
My father and I are going
to catch her red-handed.

1120
01:09:26,920 --> 01:09:29,569
Hey, I have a gift for you!

1121
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,079
No!

1122
01:09:33,159 --> 01:09:35,239
What were you trying
to do with Pa's phone?

1123
01:09:35,319 --> 01:09:36,569
I wanted to find out

1124
01:09:36,569 --> 01:09:40,880
my daughter-in-law's
deep dark secrets.
