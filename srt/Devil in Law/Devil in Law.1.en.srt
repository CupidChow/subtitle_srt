1
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,280
Da.

2
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,119
Da.

3
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,879
Da, can you hear me?

4
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,280
Da.

5
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:10,560
Please wait outside.

6
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,719
Da.

7
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,840
- My baby...
- What did you say?

8
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,319
Take care of my baby.

9
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,959
Why are you asking me
to take care of your baby?

10
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,120
You will be fine,
and we will be together again.

11
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,560
Don't leave my baby

12
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,359
with Madame.

13
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,599
Promise me, Pa.

14
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,239
Promise me that
you will protect my baby.

15
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,040
I promise.

16
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,400
I promise, Da.

17
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,640
You will be all right.

18
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,799
You need to wait outside.

19
00:02:33,039 --> 00:02:34,400
How is she doing?

20
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,960
She has lost a lot of blood

21
00:02:36,039 --> 00:02:38,199
and has a major concussion,

22
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,919
sending her body into shock.

23
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:19,199
Madame Nuan.

24
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,120
I'm chipping in to help
host Srikanda's funeral.

25
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,400
I suggest you save the money

26
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,039
and use it to make merit
for yourself instead.

27
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,840
What a good mouth you've got.

28
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,240
Why didn't you teach your sister
to be more like you?

29
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,719
What did Da ever do to you?

30
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,680
Why do you hate her so much?

31
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,839
Your sister

32
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,170
wasn't good enough
to be my daughter-in-law.

33
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,199
But she loved your son.

34
00:04:25,279 --> 00:04:28,240
There's a difference
between love and lust.

35
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:31,610
What's wrong? Did your years
abroad make it difficult for you

36
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,920
to tell the difference?

37
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,560
What about you?

38
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:38,240
Can you tell the difference
between right and wrong?

39
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:42,240
You shouldn't have a problem unless
you're beneath contempt.

40
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,959
It's not a good idea
for a kid like you

41
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,170
to declare yourself as my enemy.

42
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:50,360
From today onwards,

43
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,730
we are officially enemies,

44
00:04:54,519 --> 00:04:55,839
Madame Nuan.

45
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:16,000
(Oil platform)

46
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:18,480
Nai.

47
00:05:27,399 --> 00:05:28,800
Why don't we spend a night

48
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:32,480
with some girls on our way home
to Bangkok tomorrow?

49
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
No, thanks.

50
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,600
I would rather head straight home.

51
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,199
Why? Are you afraid
your wife might find out?

52
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:40,519
How about this?
I'll keep it a secret.

53
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,519
I'll pass.

54
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,360
But not because I'm scared of her.

55
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,959
It's just I'd never do that to her.

56
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,680
I'd rather much spend time
with my wife and kid.

57
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,560
Dang. Fine.

58
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,279
Mr. Best Husband.

59
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,959
Let's go then.

60
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,240
Nai.

61
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,759
(Shocking! Madame Nuansamorn
Kept Her Daughter-in-law Captive)

62
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:13,160
(and Abused Her to Death
at Their Residence)

63
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,279
It was an accident.

64
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,079
What do you mean?

65
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,000
How did she end up in
the storage room?

66
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,040
Let's just talk at home.

67
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,680
I want to know the truth now.

68
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,079
Trust me, Nai.

69
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,279
It's no use for us
to talk about this right now.

70
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,279
I want you to know

71
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,079
that I'm deeply saddened

72
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,160
by what happened to Srikanda.

73
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,079
Where are you right now?

74
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,079
Do you want me to pick you up?

75
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,720
No, I'm on my way home.

76
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,120
But I'm stopping by to see Da first.

77
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,439
How mad did Nai sound, Mom?

78
00:07:56,439 --> 00:07:59,040
I'm glad to know
you love your younger brother.

79
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,800
We've only got each other.

80
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,759
I can't bear seeing him
marry someone I hate.

81
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,120
I can't let either one of you

82
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:12,480
be with a good-for-nothing
like Srikanda.

83
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,480
I'm glad she's dead now.

84
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
Madame.

85
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,079
The car is ready for you.

86
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,319
(Police)

87
00:08:28,399 --> 00:08:30,120
Is this her car?

88
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,680
- Is it Madame?
- I think so.

89
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,519
It's really her.

90
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,799
- Madame, give us an interview.
- Back off.

91
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:38,159
- Madame.
- Follow me.

92
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,840
- Did you kill your daughter-in-law?
- Madame.

93
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,639
- Give us an interview.
- Madame, don't go yet.

94
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,960
Make way, please.

95
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,450
- Make way.
- Madame.

96
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:47,090
Give us the details of the case.

97
00:08:47,159 --> 00:08:49,240
Please let Madame
give her statement first.

98
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,799
Da...

99
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,759
Da...

100
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,120
Da...

101
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,120
Da...

102
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:12,679
Stay away from my daughter. Go away!

103
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,399
- Dad.
- Uncle Nit, no.

104
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,840
- Dad.
- Nit.

105
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:22,799
You are not allowed to touch
my daughter, irresponsible scumbag.

106
00:10:23,799 --> 00:10:26,159
- Let go of me.
- Let's talk it out at home later.

107
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,759
Please do this for Da. Please, Dad.

108
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,720
What did you promise me?

109
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:35,240
You promised to take
the best care of my daughter

110
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:38,840
to make up for the fact
that she chose you over her own dad.

111
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,720
But you never took care of her.

112
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,039
Then you recklessly
let your mother kill her.

113
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,720
- I'm going to kill him.
- Dad, calm down.

114
00:10:46,799 --> 00:10:49,000
- Calm down, Dad.
- Let go of me.

115
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,720
- Dad, calm down.
- Nit.

116
00:10:50,799 --> 00:10:52,600
Auntie, please stay with Dad.

117
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:54,519
Nit, calm down.

118
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,720
Come with me.

119
00:10:55,799 --> 00:10:59,360
I curse your family
to meet eternal doom.

120
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,840
Your hearts will break into
a million pieces like mine is.

121
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:02,960
Nit.

122
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,120
Let go.

123
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,039
You should leave.

124
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,799
I want to stay by Da's side.

125
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,679
What's the point now?

126
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,120
Why weren't you there to protect her
when she was still alive?

127
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,080
You let your family

128
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,360
abuse my sister to death.

129
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,480
My mother said it was an accident.

130
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,759
And you believe her?

131
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:32,440
You know that your mother
didn't approve of Da.

132
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,440
I know.

133
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:38,000
But I thought
they were starting to get along.

134
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:41,960
Every time I came home,

135
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:44,799
Da never complained about anything.

136
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,559
That's because Da loved you.

137
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:50,519
She didn't want to cause trouble
between you and Madame Nuan.

138
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:54,440
If you had paid attention, you would
have realized something was up.

139
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,679
It's my fault.

140
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,080
Pa.

141
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:02,720
Yes, it's your fault.

142
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,039
Everything's your fault.

143
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,960
Why did Da have to fall
for a man like you?

144
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,600
You should go.

145
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,879
I'll talk to my father
once he calms down.

146
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,759
My mother said
you took Nick with you.

147
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:31,279
Where's my son?

148
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,120
Get some sleep.

149
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,919
I know.

150
00:12:42,679 --> 00:12:43,799
Dao.

151
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,919
Mr. Nai, hello.

152
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,320
Go to your father.

153
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,840
Now that your mother's gone,

154
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,720
I'll take care of you.

155
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,360
Madame Nuan,
did you kill your daughter-in-law?

156
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,840
How's the case going?

157
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,840
I'm going to explain it to you all.

158
00:13:32,919 --> 00:13:35,759
Today, Madame Nuan
has given her statement

159
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,840
to prove her innocence.

160
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,440
She's still having a hard time
dealing with what happened.

161
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,360
Once she feels better,

162
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,759
she will host a press conference.

163
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,399
We have to go.

164
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,240
- When's the press conference?
- Give us a date.

165
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,799
- When is it?
- When?

166
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,480
- Don't go yet.
- When's the press conference?

167
00:13:54,679 --> 00:13:58,559
Our lawyer has confirmed that,
legally, you are off the hook,

168
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,600
but socially,
you are still being condemned.

169
00:14:01,679 --> 00:14:04,799
Especially since people see you

170
00:14:04,879 --> 00:14:07,639
as a cruel daughter-in-law-killing
kind of woman,

171
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,240
it could affect
your billion-dollar business.

172
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,639
What does it have to do with that?

173
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,919
It's all related.

174
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:17,559
Madame Nuan is
the best lobbyist in the industry.

175
00:14:17,919 --> 00:14:21,279
Her career requires a good
reputation and credibility.

176
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:25,279
It wasn't easy
to get where I am today.

177
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,960
I won't allow anyone

178
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:30,600
to ruin the reputation I've built.

179
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,840
Madame, Nai's back.

180
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,919
- Did Nai ask you any questions?
- Yes.

181
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,879
But I followed Madame's order
and told him

182
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,639
to wait for the truth from her.

183
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,799
Should I talk to Nai?

184
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,720
He might understand why we did
what we did to Srikanda.

185
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,759
No.

186
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:01,639
Do not let anyone inside

187
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,480
unless I call for you.

188
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,120
Nai.

189
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,320
Hello, Mom.

190
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,960
Stay strong.

191
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:36,919
Time will heal all the pain
you are feeling.

192
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,600
Mom.

193
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:41,080
I want to know what happened to Da.

194
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,840
(Day of the incident)

195
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,000
Congratulations again on winning
the Woman of the Year Award.

196
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,159
You are very popular right now.

197
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,399
Every company wants to hire you
to be their consultant.

198
00:16:14,919 --> 00:16:16,879
Don't forget to consider my company.

199
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,879
I will always

200
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,519
choose you first, Singkorn.

201
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,559
And you will have even fewer things
to worry about

202
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,039
after our two families

203
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,399
become one.

204
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,600
Nai.

205
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,840
I'm not overly dressed up, am I?

206
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,559
Do you think your mom will like it?

207
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:39,279
Can you come closer?

208
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,360
Yes?

209
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,519
You look beautiful. So beautiful.

210
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,879
Please wear this dress for me
when I go back.

211
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,519
Nick might get a younger sibling.

212
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,279
Nai.

213
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,720
Dao and Nick are right here.

214
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:03,919
I have to go.

215
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,170
I need to help your mom
welcome the guests.

216
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:08,200
The guests are starting to arrive.

217
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:11,519
Okay, I have
to get back to work too.

218
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,890
Oh, wait.
Pa is coming back today, right?

219
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,119
Yes.

220
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,799
I was going to pick her up,

221
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,079
but she wouldn't let me.

222
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:21,920
She told me to stay home
and be a good daughter-in-law.

223
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,200
Nai.

224
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,559
Take care of yourself.

225
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,650
I will. Bye.

226
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:30,650
Bye.

227
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:39,359
Mrs. Da is here.

228
00:17:40,119 --> 00:17:41,680
Mrs. Da is here.

229
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,000
Hello, Singkorn.

230
00:17:47,079 --> 00:17:48,279
It's been a while.

231
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,720
You are still a beauty.

232
00:17:50,279 --> 00:17:51,410
Thank you.

233
00:17:52,519 --> 00:17:53,799
Why are you here?

234
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:56,799
I want to help you
welcome the guests.

235
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,240
Are you sure you want to help
and not cause a scene?

236
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,720
I'm glad you are here.

237
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:10,240
I've been wanting to play with Nick.

238
00:18:11,359 --> 00:18:14,480
Let's take a group photo
and send it to Nai.

239
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,519
We should take it
before the guests arrive.

240
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,079
Come on, Da.

241
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,559
Let's take a photo.

242
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,170
Please stand closer.

243
00:18:25,279 --> 00:18:26,410
One more.

244
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,359
One, two, three.

245
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,440
One more.

246
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:31,559
One, two, three.

247
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,559
Nick, good boys don't cry.

248
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:39,170
Enough with the photos.

249
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:45,200
It's okay.

250
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:50,170
Lita, let's go inside together.

251
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,890
I have a German guest
joining us today.

252
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,240
- Teach me how to speak German.
- Okay.

253
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:58,960
- Please excuse us. Enjoy the party.
- Go ahead.

254
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,039
Let's go.

255
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,799
Go away.
Take your baby and disappear.

256
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,650
Let me take him.

257
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,440
Come here.

258
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,650
Why don't we go home first

259
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:17,410
and then figure out what to do next?

260
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,440
Please take Nick home.
I'll meet you there.

261
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,559
- Thanks.
- Okay.

262
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,410
Here, ma'am. I wrote
how you should pronounce it in Thai.

263
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,519
I think it's the perfect length.

264
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:37,119
It's enough for the person to sense
that you care about them.

265
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,170
- This is perfect.
- Yes.

266
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,519
- Let's try the first word.
- Okay.

267
00:19:40,599 --> 00:19:41,839
"Hello."

268
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,039
Good job.

269
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,119
Mother.

270
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:48,559
I asked Dao to take Nick home

271
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,720
in case you need
my help with something.

272
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,680
You can help

273
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,559
by making Lita some orange juice.

274
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
Go.

275
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,039
Okay.

276
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,440
Mrs. Da, are you making
orange juice? Do you need a hand?

277
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,170
No, it's fine. I'm almost done.

278
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,960
I see. Okay then.

279
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,839
Have you eaten anything?

280
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,240
Auntie Erb made sour soup.

281
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:22,650
Do you want some?
I'll put it in a bowl for you.

282
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,039
No, thanks.

283
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:26,799
You enjoy. I'll get it myself later.

284
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:28,720
The sour soup looks delicious.

285
00:20:31,759 --> 00:20:35,079
- Let me know if you need a hand.
- All right.

286
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:51,799
What are you doing?

287
00:20:55,839 --> 00:20:58,920
Were you going to add sour soup
to Lita's orange juice?

288
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,650
No, I wasn't.

289
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,319
I'm going to tell Mom.

290
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,480
Nade, I wasn't going to do that.

291
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:08,359
Nade, wait. Hear me out.

292
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,920
It's not what you think.

293
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,319
I don't need your excuses.

294
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,240
Save them for my mom.

295
00:21:13,319 --> 00:21:14,799
Nade.

296
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,960
- What?
- Hear me out.

297
00:21:16,079 --> 00:21:17,410
- Get off me.
- Nade.

298
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,240
- Ms. Nade!
- Why did you push me?

299
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:23,480
- Ms. Nade!
- Ms. Nade!

300
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:24,680
My dear.

301
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:25,839
Are you hurt?

302
00:21:30,079 --> 00:21:31,480
Why did you push me?

303
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:32,920
What happened here?

304
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,240
Srikanda tried to add sour soup
to Lita's orange juice.

305
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:39,920
But I didn't do it.

306
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:44,119
My guests are arriving.

307
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,410
Go away.

308
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,799
Get lost.

309
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:49,480
Don't tarnish this place
with your filthy thoughts.

310
00:21:52,599 --> 00:21:54,440
- Mother, I'm sorry.
- Let go.

311
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,640
- Let go.
- I'm sorry.

312
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,359
- Don't touch me.
- Mother.

313
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,799
- Hear me out, Mother.
- No.

314
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:01,480
Stay away from her.

315
00:22:01,599 --> 00:22:02,799
Da, please calm down.

316
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,240
Get off me!

317
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,480
Lita!

318
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,440
Lita...

319
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,920
- Lita!
- Ms. Lita!

320
00:22:24,319 --> 00:22:26,039
Take Srikanda away.

321
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,319
Don't let her near my party.

322
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,599
- Come here.
- Go inside.

323
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,079
- Come here.
- Leave her here.

324
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,599
Close the door.

325
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,880
No, let me out.

326
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:43,759
Let me out.

327
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:45,319
Let me out.

328
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,599
I said let me out.

329
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:51,640
Let me out.

330
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,200
Let me out.

331
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:55,160
I said let me out.

332
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,920
Everyone.

333
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,400
May I present you

334
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:17,160
the winner of this year's
Woman of the Year Award.

335
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,599
Please give her a warm welcome.

336
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,319
- What do you say, Pa?
- What?

337
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,000
Shall we stop for some barbecue
before I send you home?

338
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,559
Consider it a welcome back dinner.
What do you say?

339
00:24:12,039 --> 00:24:14,000
Can I go see my dad first?

340
00:24:14,599 --> 00:24:16,400
Of course. It's up to you.

341
00:24:19,079 --> 00:24:20,319
Let me lower the volume a bit.

342
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,200
I'm going to call Da and tell her
that I'm in your car now.

343
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:24,599
Okay.

344
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,200
(Pa)

345
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,839
Da.

346
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,960
Hello, Ms. Pa.

347
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,559
It's Dao.

348
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,759
Please help Da.

349
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:41,440
What happened?

350
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:44,000
Madame locked Da up in the storage.

351
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,400
Okay, I'll be right there.

352
00:24:47,599 --> 00:24:49,960
- Joy, we need to go to Da's house.
- What?

353
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,799
- Step on it, Joy.
- Okay.

354
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,759
Hey, what was that sound?

355
00:25:39,839 --> 00:25:40,839
Mrs. Da.

356
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,039
Hurry up.

357
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:50,119
Mrs. Da.

358
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:51,839
Mrs. Da.

359
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,960
Mrs. Da.

360
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,240
- She's not answering.
- What happened?

361
00:25:57,359 --> 00:25:58,799
I'm going to ask Madame what to do.

362
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,000
You are a great role model.

363
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,559
She is.

364
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,319
You look beautiful today.

365
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,480
Madame.

366
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,039
Is it just the two of you today?

367
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,640
I tried knocking on the door,
but Mrs. Da isn't answering.

368
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,799
Do you want me to open the door?

369
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,519
Madame said,

370
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,920
"Ignore her."

371
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,200
Okay.

372
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,279
Hey.

373
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,880
Where are your son
and daughter-in-law?

374
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,160
Nai has work to do.

375
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,079
And Srikanda doesn't
enjoy social events.

376
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,920
But she should at least
help out with the event.

377
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,680
It's fine.

378
00:26:47,799 --> 00:26:53,960
I don't mind as long as
she's a good wife and mother.

379
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,200
A kind mother-in-law like you
is hard to come by.

380
00:27:08,319 --> 00:27:10,799
Pa, wait.

381
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,599
- What is it, Joy?
- Wait for the police first.

382
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,799
Let's go.

383
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,920
Pa.

384
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,640
Is something wrong, Officers?

385
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,440
This lady reported

386
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:28,880
that Madame Nuan

387
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,000
abused Srikanda
and is holding her captive.

388
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,519
Officers, I'd like to report them
for trespassing.

389
00:27:35,599 --> 00:27:36,759
Go ahead.

390
00:27:36,839 --> 00:27:39,079
Ms. Pa, this way.

391
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,359
- This way.
- You can't enter.

392
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,640
Get out of my house.

393
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,920
Please excuse us.

394
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:50,519
This way, Ms. Pa.
This way, Officers.

395
00:27:50,599 --> 00:27:51,920
Ms. Pa.

396
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,039
This way.

397
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:55,319
What is it?

398
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,240
Open the door.

399
00:27:57,319 --> 00:27:58,440
No.

400
00:27:58,599 --> 00:28:00,759
We need Madame's permission first.

401
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,319
The police are here.

402
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,000
If you don't want trouble,

403
00:28:04,079 --> 00:28:05,319
open the door.

404
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,480
Open the door.

405
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:21,400
Da!

406
00:28:24,599 --> 00:28:25,920
Help me.

407
00:28:32,119 --> 00:28:33,480
Da!

408
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:34,559
Pa!

409
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,160
Pa, wait.

410
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,519
- Be patient.
- Why?

411
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,039
Pull yourself together.

412
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,559
Let the police check on her first.

413
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,519
I'm requesting an ambulance.

414
00:29:06,839 --> 00:29:08,960
You had no right
to lock her up like that.

415
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:12,559
Weren't you afraid that something
could happen to her?

416
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,880
What was I supposed to do?

417
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,119
Was I supposed to
let her ruin my party?

418
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,759
And right now,

419
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:24,079
Lita's at the hospital
with a broken arm.

420
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,920
You could have talked to her.

421
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,519
You are good at persuading people

422
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:31,640
with your words.

423
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:34,000
Why didn't you try that with Da?

424
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,680
If you think this is my fault,

425
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,680
- then I'm sorry.
- Mom.

426
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:43,400
Don't do this.

427
00:29:44,359 --> 00:29:45,440
Nai.

428
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:47,359
What must I do

429
00:29:48,039 --> 00:29:50,079
for you to sympathize with me?

430
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,599
It's all right.

431
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:56,160
It's in the past now.

432
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:59,240
We can't undo what has happened.

433
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:16,000
So tell me.

434
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:17,200
Tell you what?

435
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:21,039
Tell me what's bothering you so much
that you asked us out for a drink.

436
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,839
Is it about your mother
and sister-in-law?

437
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,359
It's nothing.

438
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:31,319
Tell us everything.
Friends don't keep secrets.

439
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,759
Fine, I'll tell you.

440
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,799
But you cannot tell anyone about it.

441
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,000
- Okay.
- Okay.

442
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,359
Was that so hard?

443
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,680
Hello.

444
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:54,319
I've taken care of it.

445
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,480
What are you talking about?

446
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:58,480
I squashed that rumor about
your bad relationship with Srikanda.

447
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,720
I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

448
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:21,039
Gosh.

449
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,839
- Pa, I'm going to use the toilet.
- Okay.

450
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,200
Hey.

451
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:31,000
Have you seen the news about Da?

452
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:33,680
The news says
Da was a horrible daughter-in-law

453
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,559
and her mother-in-law hated her.

454
00:31:36,119 --> 00:31:38,960
My niece read the news for me
from her phone.

455
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,759
It's big news.

456
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,200
What?

457
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,039
What's wrong?

458
00:31:49,119 --> 00:31:50,480
Shush. Come here.

459
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,960
- What?
- Let's go.

460
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:57,519
- What is it?
- What?

461
00:31:58,400 --> 00:31:59,920
People are gossiping about Da.

462
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,359
What?

463
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,000
It's about Da and Nai's family.

464
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,799
What? Let me see.

465
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,359
Hey, what are you guys doing?

466
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,279
- Shush.
- Shush.

467
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:11,519
Come here.

468
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:12,920
What's wrong?

469
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,119
- We need help with the funeral.
- Be quiet, Dad.

470
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,759
It's the news about Da
and Nai's family, Uncle.

471
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:26,119
"A little bird tells me"

472
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,960
"Madame Nuan disliked
her daughter-in-law"

473
00:32:29,079 --> 00:32:31,079
"because she was lazy"

474
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,839
"and spent too much money."

475
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:36,119
"The former daughter-in-law
was locked up on that day"

476
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,720
"because she caused
an unforgivable incident"

477
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,119
"due to jealousy."

478
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,279
I bet the rumor is true.

479
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,279
Da was

480
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:47,720
a weak and sickly child.

481
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,599
Her father pampered her
as if she were a rich girl.

482
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,119
Pa, her sister,
used to do everything for her.

483
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,279
Da must have married a rich guy
so she wouldn't have

484
00:32:57,359 --> 00:32:58,720
to move a finger.

485
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,480
I hear

486
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:03,039
her mother-in-law locked her up

487
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,200
because she threw a tantrum
due to jealousy.

488
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:10,720
I would never accept that kind of
woman as my daughter-in-law.

489
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:11,920
Darn it!

490
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,160
Wait.

491
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,680
Ignore them.

492
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,039
Those people are badmouthing
the deceased at the temple.

493
00:33:19,119 --> 00:33:20,319
Ignore them. All right?

494
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,960
- Just ignore them.
- I can't, Auntie Orn.

495
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:23,839
Pa.

496
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,039
- Pa.
- She's right, Mother.

497
00:33:25,119 --> 00:33:27,880
We can't let those sharp-tongued
people say whatever they want.

498
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,759
Wait, Joy.

499
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,559
It's a shame she misbehaved

500
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,839
after managing to land a rich guy...

501
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,440
Why did you stop?

502
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,400
Finish your sentence.

503
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,440
Do you not want to hurt my feelings?

504
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,400
You have nothing to fear
if you are certain

505
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:51,039
what you are saying is true.

506
00:33:51,119 --> 00:33:52,680
We don't know if it's true.

507
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,359
Then why did you say that about Da?

508
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:58,079
Imagine if other people heard you

509
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,359
and spread
those bad rumors about Da.

510
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,920
I won't stop you

511
00:34:02,319 --> 00:34:04,079
from gossiping,

512
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,319
but please know the time
and the place.

513
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:08,840
We are inside a temple,

514
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,000
and Da's body is lying right there.

515
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:14,840
At least, be considerate of
fellow beings like me and my father.

516
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,440
We just lost someone we love dearly.

517
00:34:18,519 --> 00:34:19,920
Yet, here you are

518
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,440
spreading rumors which
you don't even know are true.

519
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,119
What good would it do?

520
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,039
Don't just sit there.

521
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,769
Apologize to her.

522
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,199
I'm sorry.

523
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,159
I'm sorry too.

524
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:39,039
Hey.

525
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,519
Oh my goodness.

526
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:42,880
You are lucky

527
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,289
I didn't splash
boiling water on you.

528
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,480
I better not hear you badmouthing
my daughter again.

529
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,039
I won't be this kind next time.

530
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,159
Let's go.

531
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:01,239
Forget about them.

532
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:07,039
Nit.

533
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,519
Drink some water to cool down.

534
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:10,599
Thank you so much.

535
00:35:10,679 --> 00:35:11,679
Take one, Pa.

536
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,440
Thank you.

537
00:35:22,039 --> 00:35:23,719
My friend did some digging.

538
00:35:23,809 --> 00:35:25,039
The reporter

539
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,039
got the information
from Nadedao's friend.

540
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,039
Nadedao? Who's that?

541
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:33,079
She is Nai's sister, Mother.

542
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:37,239
They are purposely
giving Da a bad name

543
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:39,599
so the public thinks
they are good people.

544
00:35:40,809 --> 00:35:44,079
I bet they are telling everyone
that Da was a bad person.

545
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,119
Da, my dear.

546
00:35:48,769 --> 00:35:50,719
How unfortunate of you.

547
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,480
People are even framing you
after you are gone.

548
00:35:56,199 --> 00:35:59,239
Pa, call Nai's family for me.

549
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:01,769
I'm going to tell them
to fix the news.

550
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,159
Gosh, it's pointless, Dad.

551
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:07,639
They will never admit
that they are framing Da.

552
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:11,329
Joy's friend can be our witness.

553
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,920
Then trouble will come her way.

554
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:16,639
Madame Nuan is very powerful.

555
00:36:17,199 --> 00:36:20,159
Are we going to let people
misunderstand Da

556
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:23,519
and think of Madame Nuan
as an angel?

557
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,119
No, Dad.

558
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:27,400
I won't let things be like this.

559
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:31,769
I'm going to show everyone what kind
of person Madame Nuan really is.

560
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,400
- Auntie Orn, hello.
- Hey.

561
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:47,239
Auntie Orn, what happened?

562
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:03,289
Did you like me
when I first married your son?

563
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,159
You were ill-mannered

564
00:37:07,239 --> 00:37:09,119
and sucked at doing chores.

565
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,440
Who would have liked you?

566
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,079
Hey... Oops.

567
00:37:12,559 --> 00:37:15,119
There. See?

568
00:37:15,679 --> 00:37:17,000
Just give it to me.

569
00:37:17,079 --> 00:37:18,769
I want to help you.

570
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,360
Consider it practice for me.

571
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,119
Are you sure you can do it?

572
00:37:22,809 --> 00:37:25,480
You can practice on that flower.
It's all yours.

573
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:31,769
Why didn't you tell your son
to dump me then?

574
00:37:33,199 --> 00:37:35,199
I gave birth to him,

575
00:37:35,289 --> 00:37:36,960
but I don't own him.

576
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:39,809
I have to support

577
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,769
the woman he chooses.

578
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:45,920
I'm lucky to have such
an understanding mother-in-law.

579
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:49,480
If I had Madame Nuan
as my mother-in-law...

580
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,599
What you did was wrong.

581
00:37:53,159 --> 00:37:56,559
I hear you spread the rumor
about Da and Mom.

582
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:58,360
That's not true.

583
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:01,239
I never badmouthed Srikanda.

584
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:04,039
I only told my friends
what happened on that night.

585
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:06,809
They added the details themselves.

586
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:10,199
But people wouldn't
think badly of my wife

587
00:38:10,769 --> 00:38:12,039
if you didn't ignite the rumor.

588
00:38:12,809 --> 00:38:14,360
Would it make you happier

589
00:38:14,809 --> 00:38:17,400
if it was the other way around

590
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:19,199
and I was the one being badmouthed?

591
00:38:24,559 --> 00:38:26,119
If that's what you want,

592
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:28,400
I'll call the reporters

593
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,769
and ask them to fix the news

594
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,880
by publishing that
Srikanda died because of me.

595
00:38:40,639 --> 00:38:41,920
Please hang up, Mom.

596
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,000
I'm not blaming anyone.

597
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,559
Consider it a gentle warning.

598
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,360
Don't let it happen again.

599
00:38:51,199 --> 00:38:52,960
I feel sorry for Da's family.

600
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,239
They have suffered enough.

601
00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:58,289
I'm begging you.

602
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,000
Do you realize how much
of an idiot you are?

603
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:10,480
When you plan to frame someone,

604
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,480
make sure it cannot
be traced back to you.

605
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:44,880
Da...

606
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,239
Do you know

607
00:40:20,809 --> 00:40:23,329
how much I miss you?

608
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,119
If I had returned sooner,

609
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:28,159
you wouldn't...

610
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,079
I'm sorry, Da.

611
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,360
I'm sorry.

612
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:39,239
I'm sorry.

613
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,289
Please don't leave me, Da.

614
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,960
I promise

615
00:41:25,639 --> 00:41:28,519
to take better care
of you and our son.

616
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,679
You won't ever be alone again.

617
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,519
Please come back and stay with me.

618
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:08,719
Da.

619
00:42:08,809 --> 00:42:11,000
I'll take better care of you, Da.

620
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,960
I promise, Da.

621
00:42:14,719 --> 00:42:16,440
I have to go, Nai.

622
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,119
My time with you has come to an end.

623
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,159
Thank you for coming.

624
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,039
Thank you for coming.

625
00:43:48,039 --> 00:43:49,039
Thank you.

626
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,360
Dad.

627
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:15,119
Put aside your anger for Da.

628
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,320
I'm sorry for your loss.

629
00:44:44,679 --> 00:44:46,440
Da's mother-in-law is kind enough...

630
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:48,760
- to show up.
- I know.

631
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:13,920
My dear.

632
00:45:15,639 --> 00:45:17,400
I hope you are born

633
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,199
as my daughter again
in the next life.

634
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:45,880
Promise me, Pa.

635
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,559
Promise me that
you will protect my baby.

636
00:45:51,159 --> 00:45:53,159
Don't leave my baby

637
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,960
with Madame.

638
00:45:56,039 --> 00:45:57,960
Promise me, Pa.

639
00:45:58,039 --> 00:45:59,800
I promise.

640
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:03,119
I promise, Da.

641
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:04,840
I...

642
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:09,199
will never forget
the promise I gave you.

643
00:46:40,039 --> 00:46:42,039
Joy said you wanted to talk to me.

644
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,840
My dad and I

645
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:53,320
will raise Nick ourselves.

646
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,639
No.

647
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,480
He's my son.

648
00:46:58,639 --> 00:46:59,880
He needs to stay with me.

649
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:02,119
I'm worried about my nephew.

650
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,039
One day, Madame Nuan will force you
to marry someone she approves of.

651
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:09,800
When that time comes,

652
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,400
Nick will be pushed aside.

653
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,159
That will never happen.

654
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,360
What are you referring to?

655
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,559
You getting remarried?

656
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:21,679
Or my nephew getting pushed aside?

657
00:47:22,239 --> 00:47:23,559
Both.

658
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:25,440
I don't believe you.

659
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:29,519
You promised

660
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:32,239
to take care of my sister,

661
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:34,800
but you couldn't even do that.

662
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,360
What must I do for you to trust me?

663
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,360
There's something you can do.

664
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,760
But you will need to work with me.

665
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:46,480
What is it?

666
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:48,960
Marry me.

667
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,679
Mr. Nai.

668
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:01,760
Madame Nuan wants you inside.

669
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,719
Hey, Nai.

670
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,239
Here you are.

671
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:14,000
Join us for dinner.

672
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:16,880
Good evening, sir.

673
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,440
Good evening.

674
00:48:18,719 --> 00:48:20,440
Long time no see.

675
00:48:20,519 --> 00:48:24,320
Yes, I've been busy with work,
so I couldn't come home often.

676
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:27,159
Come sit.

677
00:48:27,239 --> 00:48:28,840
Sit next to Lita.

678
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,800
Hi, Lita.

679
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,519
Hi, Nai.

680
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,320
I was planning to visit your home
after the funeral.

681
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:44,960
I invited Lita over

682
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:47,599
to apologize for the incident.

683
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,280
It was an accident.

684
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,960
No one wanted it to happen.

685
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,159
How nice of you to say that, Lita.

686
00:48:55,840 --> 00:48:59,920
I wonder who will be the lucky guy
that gets to marry you.

687
00:49:01,239 --> 00:49:04,039
To be honest, I'm actually
protective of my daughter.

688
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:06,480
But on the other hand,

689
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,400
I hope she finds a good man

690
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,719
so I know she has someone

691
00:49:10,199 --> 00:49:11,480
to take care of her.

692
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,760
You don't have to answer me now.

693
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,880
But I hear your mother
is ordering your maids

694
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:28,800
to prepare dinner
for her new future daughter-in-law.

695
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,199
Unless you occupy yourself

696
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:34,079
by marrying me,

697
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,000
there's no way you will get
to live your life in peace.

698
00:50:00,199 --> 00:50:02,239
(Your Signature)

699
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:07,519
Da!

700
00:50:07,519 --> 00:50:09,480
Promise me, Pa.

701
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,440
Promise me that
you will protect my baby.

702
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:13,079
What kind of woman

703
00:50:13,159 --> 00:50:15,559
is good enough
to be your daughter-in-law?

704
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:19,840
A woman who isn't a weakly lowlife
like you and your sister.

705
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,079
From today onwards,

706
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:24,199
we are officially enemies,

707
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:25,960
Madame Nuan.

708
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,800
(Your Signature)

709
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:42,480
All done.

710
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:47,519
Don't forget about our deal.

711
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:50,079
You will let me break the news
to my mother myself.

712
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:51,639
I won't.

713
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:53,440
When are you going to tell her?

714
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,079
Tonight.

715
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,000
So you can bring Nick back
to my house tomorrow.

716
00:51:00,159 --> 00:51:01,440
Okay.

717
00:51:01,519 --> 00:51:03,920
Where are you heading now?
I will give you a ride.

718
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:05,559
It's fine.

719
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,679
I have something to take care of.

720
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,119
Where are you going?

721
00:51:09,199 --> 00:51:10,480
I'm going to my office

722
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,039
to request a vacation.

723
00:51:13,159 --> 00:51:15,280
- See you tomorrow then.
- See you.

724
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:33,440
Hello, Madame Nuan's Residence.

725
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,079
Who is it again?

726
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,400
Pa?

727
00:51:39,239 --> 00:51:41,000
Is it Pawinee, Srikanda's sister?

728
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:42,559
Yes.

729
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:53,960
What business do you have with us?

730
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:58,559
Pawinee wants to apologize to me?

731
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:03,000
Yes, she called saying she wants
to come and apologize in person.

732
00:52:03,559 --> 00:52:05,199
What else could she apologize for

733
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,840
if not for ruining your reputation?

734
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:10,199
It's strange.

735
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,039
Why did she suddenly give up?

736
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:19,079
Pawinee recently got
her master's degree in America.

737
00:52:19,159 --> 00:52:20,519
She must be looking for a job.

738
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:24,360
If Pawinee keeps up
with current news

739
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,639
and wishes to work for
a big company,

740
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:31,320
she should know that it's not
a good idea to go up against you.

741
00:52:33,239 --> 00:52:34,559
You are probably right.

742
00:52:35,079 --> 00:52:36,079
Luckily,

743
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,920
she still has some brains left.

744
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,239
Mom.

745
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:45,119
As soon as she hung up,
I called reporters to make sure

746
00:52:45,199 --> 00:52:48,320
they will be here to capture
the moment she apologizes to you.

747
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,280
It will help with the rumors
about Srikanda.

748
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:55,639
- Pa's coming to apologize to Mom?
- Yes.

749
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:58,880
Mom wants you home
as soon as possible

750
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:01,920
because reporters are coming today.

751
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,039
With everybody present,

752
00:53:04,119 --> 00:53:07,920
the rumor about Mom killing
Srikanda will finally be squashed.

753
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,519
But I was with Pa just now.

754
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:12,239
She didn't mention anything...

755
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,199
Could she be...

756
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:17,519
Could she what?

757
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:18,920
I have to go, Nade.

758
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,199
What's with him?

759
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,559
(Recents)

760
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:29,840
(Pa)

761
00:53:35,159 --> 00:53:36,440
(Pa)

762
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,440
She's not answering.

763
00:53:42,199 --> 00:53:43,760
What is she planning to do?

764
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:53,920
Here you go. Keep the change.

765
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:29,960
She invited reporters?

766
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:31,920
That's good.

767
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:38,039
Mrs. Da's sister is here.
What do we do?

768
00:54:38,599 --> 00:54:39,679
Go get Madame.

769
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,639
- Go now.
- Okay.

770
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,159
- Hello.
- Hello.

771
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,320
Madame is here.

772
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,559
Hello again.

773
00:55:15,639 --> 00:55:17,599
It's an auspicious day today

774
00:55:17,679 --> 00:55:20,920
because Pawinee is here
to make peace with Madame Nuan.

775
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,800
Everyone, please rest assured

776
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:27,800
that Srikanda's family
is still in good terms

777
00:55:28,039 --> 00:55:30,000
with Madame Nuan.

778
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,760
None of them believes

779
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:34,400
Madame Nuan killed Srikanda.

780
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,039
Isn't that right, Pawinee?

781
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:43,639
Let's not

782
00:55:43,719 --> 00:55:45,800
talk about the past.

783
00:55:46,280 --> 00:55:48,280
It's better to discuss the present.

784
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,800
You are one lucky girl.

785
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,400
My mom always gives people
a second chance.

786
00:55:55,159 --> 00:55:56,280
A second chance?

787
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,360
Don't give it to me.

788
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:00,599
I don't want it.

789
00:56:01,159 --> 00:56:02,320
You don't want a second chance?

790
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,239
What do you want then?

791
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:08,480
I want your love.

792
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,440
I hope you love

793
00:56:17,719 --> 00:56:19,400
and adore me.

794
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,960
Please take pictures.

795
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:31,119
Please let us take some photos.

796
00:56:31,199 --> 00:56:32,320
Good. Smile.

797
00:56:38,199 --> 00:56:41,000
Because I'm your new
daughter-in-law.

798
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:47,400
Her new daughter-in-law?

799
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,119
- Her new daughter-in-law?
- Daughter-in-law?

800
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,679
What are you talking about?

801
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,880
Don't get mad just yet.

802
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:56,079
Don't call me a liar
and get mad at me.

803
00:56:56,159 --> 00:56:58,599
Let me finish
what I have to say first.

804
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,800
Take a look.

805
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:08,440
(Marriage Certificate)

806
00:57:08,519 --> 00:57:09,800
(Mr. Noppanai Wongkulthanasup
and Ms. Pawinee Wongkulthanasup)

807
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:14,159
Nai and I registered
our marriage earlier today.

808
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:18,239
I wanted to show you
our marriage certificate.

809
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:21,880
Nade, thank you very much

810
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:25,079
for inviting all these reporters.

811
00:57:25,159 --> 00:57:27,400
Now, everybody knows

812
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,199
Madame Nuan's son,
a charming widower,

813
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,039
is officially taken.

814
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:35,320
If you are curious

815
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:38,039
how I became the lucky girl,

816
00:57:38,239 --> 00:57:41,599
I will have to save the story
for family members only.

817
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,079
Or should I just tell you now?

818
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:47,239
This story can be
the new talk of the town,

819
00:57:47,320 --> 00:57:49,760
instead of Madame Nuan's
daughter-in-law-killing story.

820
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,679
What do you say?

821
00:57:58,599 --> 00:57:59,639
Let's get started.

822
00:58:01,239 --> 00:58:02,400
My goodness.

823
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,639
- Nade.
- Stop framing my mom.

824
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:06,599
If she had wanted
to kill your sister,

825
00:58:06,679 --> 00:58:09,960
your sister would
have been gone long ago.

826
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:11,679
Nade.

827
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,800
I got this, Mom.

828
00:58:14,320 --> 00:58:15,320
My goodness.

829
00:58:16,320 --> 00:58:17,480
- Oh no.
- Go away.

830
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:18,920
Do you think I believe you?

831
00:58:19,719 --> 00:58:22,760
Nai would never marry you.

832
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,079
He's not that reckless.

833
00:58:25,159 --> 00:58:28,239
No matter how wide you have your
legs open, he will never choose you.

834
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:30,119
Now leave.

835
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:34,440
Get out. Get out of my house.

836
00:58:34,519 --> 00:58:36,480
Nade, no.

837
00:58:37,559 --> 00:58:38,679
I'm glad you are here.

838
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,960
Tell the reporters

839
00:58:40,039 --> 00:58:42,760
that the marriage certificate
she brought is fake.

840
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:51,440
Tell them.

841
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,880
Pa and I are married.

842
00:58:57,480 --> 00:58:58,559
It's real.

843
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,960
How could you do this?

844
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,639
How could you?

845
00:59:08,639 --> 00:59:10,440
How could you, Nai?

846
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:15,199
- Is it true?
- Is it true?

847
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,280
Is the marriage certificate real?

848
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:18,719
Is the marriage certificate real?

849
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,360
I have to ask for your cooperation.

850
00:59:22,719 --> 00:59:26,000
Please keep
this family matter a secret.

851
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:29,320
If anything gets leaked
to the public

852
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:32,400
and it causes problems
for our family,

853
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,679
I won't let it pass.

854
00:59:37,119 --> 00:59:38,800
- Tom.
- Yes.

855
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:40,199
Please take care of it.

856
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:43,320
- Madame.
- Madame.

857
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,400
- Please make way.
- Is it true?

858
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,800
- Madame.
- Madame.

859
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:49,880
Why are you doing this?

860
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:53,079
Didn't we agree that I'd break
the news to my mother myself?

861
00:59:53,159 --> 00:59:55,679
I made things easier for you.

862
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:58,960
It would have been a waste of time

863
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:01,920
if you had been too afraid
to tell her the truth.

864
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:03,920
Why exactly did you want

865
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,679
to marry me?

866
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:08,639
I told you.

867
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:12,159
I'm using myself as a shield to ward
off the girls your mother finds you

868
01:00:12,639 --> 01:00:16,400
so that my nephew doesn't end up
with a mean stepmother.

869
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,599
Are you sure that's all?

870
01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:24,760
Pa.

871
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:26,400
Tell me.

872
01:00:26,920 --> 01:00:28,519
What is your agenda?

873
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:32,079
I'll make everyone come
to a realization

874
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:35,000
how awful Madame Nuan,

875
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:37,079
your older sister,

876
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:39,559
and your family are.

877
01:00:40,360 --> 01:00:42,920
Everyone deserves to know
what Da had to go through.

878
01:00:43,880 --> 01:00:45,760
And I'm going to make
Madame Nuan realize

879
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,239
that she was much luckier
to have Da as her daughter-in-law,

880
01:00:48,320 --> 01:00:50,400
compared to me.

881
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,639
Don't try to stop me.

882
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:57,199
I won't agree to a divorce anyway.

883
01:00:58,639 --> 01:01:00,039
Do you think I don't know

884
01:01:00,559 --> 01:01:01,960
what you are up to?

885
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:06,599
It's obvious.

886
01:01:06,679 --> 01:01:09,119
I know how much you hate my mother.

887
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:13,000
You warding off the girls
my mother finds me

888
01:01:13,559 --> 01:01:14,679
is only an excuse.

889
01:01:15,159 --> 01:01:18,079
Why did you marry me
if you already knew then?

890
01:01:18,159 --> 01:01:20,199
I wanted to hear the truth
from your mouth.

891
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:24,840
It might be good
for you to live here.

892
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,480
This way, you will get to know

893
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:28,480
my mother better.

894
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:33,159
I've lived with her my whole life.
I know her well.

895
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,280
She's not a bad person,
despite how she seems.

896
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:38,280
Also,

897
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:42,079
I'm certain that you truly
love and worry about Nick.

898
01:01:42,639 --> 01:01:44,079
You will be able to take care of him

899
01:01:44,559 --> 01:01:47,440
and protect him from harm.

900
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,280
Give me six months.

901
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,880
If I manage to prove

902
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,400
that your mother is not
a good person like you think,

903
01:02:00,599 --> 01:02:04,159
you must give me
full custody of Nick.

904
01:02:05,119 --> 01:02:06,679
But if I fail to prove it,

905
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:09,639
I will apologize to Madame Nuan

906
01:02:10,039 --> 01:02:12,679
for misjudging her.
Do we have a deal?

907
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:16,000
It's a deal.

908
01:02:17,760 --> 01:02:19,480
I will show you

909
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:22,719
how blind you've been.

910
01:02:33,079 --> 01:02:34,840
Mr. Nai.

911
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:37,840
Madame wants to see you.

912
01:02:39,639 --> 01:02:40,920
I'll send you off here then, Pa.

913
01:02:45,679 --> 01:02:46,800
Not you.

914
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:49,800
Only Mr. Nai can go inside.

915
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,800
No strangers are allowed.

916
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,360
But I'm not a stranger.

917
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:10,880
How many times have I told you

918
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:13,880
to be patient and control yourself

919
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:15,320
when you are in public,

920
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:18,480
especially when you are
in front of reporters?

921
01:03:18,559 --> 01:03:21,000
As long as you are impatient,

922
01:03:21,199 --> 01:03:23,199
you will never be above anyone else.

923
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:27,679
Don't waste your time on me.

924
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,880
Go lecture your beloved son.

925
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,119
Nai.

926
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:36,639
I need an explanation.

927
01:03:38,159 --> 01:03:40,320
Da left a dying request.

928
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:42,400
She wanted Pa to raise Nick.

929
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,880
So what?
She can raise Nick all she wants.

930
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,679
Why did she have to marry you?

931
01:03:49,239 --> 01:03:52,519
Because Da wanted to pass
her husband onto her sister.

932
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,039
Nai, you are...

933
01:03:55,639 --> 01:03:56,800
so stupid.

934
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:58,719
You are being used.

935
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:01,239
Please rest assured

936
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:03,039
that I'm not being used.

937
01:04:04,039 --> 01:04:06,039
I voluntarily agreed
to every step of it.

938
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:11,320
Nai.

939
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:13,480
You know that I love you.

940
01:04:13,559 --> 01:04:15,880
I'm ready to help you with anything.

941
01:04:15,960 --> 01:04:18,079
Just tell me the truth.

942
01:04:19,719 --> 01:04:21,760
Tell them.

943
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:27,920
That we love each other.

944
01:04:31,639 --> 01:04:33,360
Love?

945
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,960
Since when?

946
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,840
Well.

947
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:39,760
Since Da's funeral.

948
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:45,440
We got to spend time together

949
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:48,119
and comforted each other
during a hard time.

950
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:52,320
We started to have feelings
for one another.

951
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:56,079
Srikanda has been dead
for less than a month.

952
01:04:57,280 --> 01:04:58,400
Nade.

953
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:04,199
Sometimes it only takes seconds
to fall in love with somebody.

954
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:10,039
Listen.

955
01:05:10,119 --> 01:05:14,559
Do you have
any more questions for us?

956
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:18,800
If not,

957
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:21,159
we are going to go.

958
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,639
Let's go, Nai.

959
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,440
Come on.

960
01:05:33,199 --> 01:05:37,199
Madame, that woman is definitely
using black magic on him.

961
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:41,039
Is Sompit right, Mom?

962
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:43,440
Nai is not under a spell.

963
01:05:44,280 --> 01:05:46,159
Pawinee is lying to us.

964
01:05:47,599 --> 01:05:50,639
Nai isn't the type to fall in love
with a woman easily.

965
01:05:51,559 --> 01:05:52,840
Those two

966
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,719
are hiding something from us.

967
01:05:57,239 --> 01:05:58,760
You are a good actor.

968
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,519
I did it to save your butt.

969
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:05,679
Then you should know

970
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,239
that you are looking for trouble.

971
01:06:10,119 --> 01:06:13,760
My mother didn't buy
the story of our true love.

972
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:18,360
You will have to pretend
to be my wife for a long time.

973
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:49,679
Seduce Madame Nuan's son
and make him your husband.

974
01:06:49,760 --> 01:06:51,119
I won't be able to accept the fact

975
01:06:51,199 --> 01:06:53,719
my two daughters share a husband.

976
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:55,639
What would you like
to talk to me about,

977
01:06:55,719 --> 01:06:57,079
Mother-in-Law?

978
01:06:57,159 --> 01:06:58,920
I always have a soft spot

979
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,280
for defiant ones like you.

980
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:01,880
You should ignore
what Nade said to you.

981
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,400
I hate your guts.

982
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:06,880
It's because I don't want you two
to be my in-laws.

983
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:11,599
Nadedao is here! Hello!

984
01:07:12,119 --> 01:07:14,159
You flashed him your breasts.

985
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:16,159
Please don't
kick me out of the house.

986
01:07:16,239 --> 01:07:17,239
Pawinee!
