1
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,280
I'm sorry, son.

2
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:45,360
Madame.

3
00:02:45,439 --> 00:02:46,479
The doctor said
Nai is losing a lot of blood.

4
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,479
He needs a blood transfusion.

5
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
Nai...

6
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,159
- Ms. Pawinee.
- Yes?

7
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,639
Mr. Panit has gone into shock.

8
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,039
His heart may stop beating.

9
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,199
The doctor is trying to save him.

10
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,759
I'm about to have no one left.

11
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:01,080
You have hurt everyone I love.

12
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,879
Nai.

13
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,879
You sacrificed yourself
to save Pa's life after all.

14
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,919
You are my son-in-law now.

15
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,039
Ms. Pa.

16
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,840
How are you doing?

17
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,360
I'm fine.

18
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,240
Nai's also safe as well.

19
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,560
What about your dad?

20
00:03:35,639 --> 00:03:38,800
He's even healthier and safer too.

21
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,039
Thank you so much
for worrying about us, Jai.

22
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,439
- You're welcome.
- How's Nick?

23
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,319
He's inside with Dao.

24
00:03:45,639 --> 00:03:49,560
Oh, Madame said to go
and see her once you're back.

25
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:57,639
Come in.

26
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,360
I've been told you wanted to see me.

27
00:04:05,919 --> 00:04:07,479
Is there something
you'd like to talk to me about?

28
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:11,400
Tin and his men
are going to turn themselves in.

29
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:14,120
But what about you?

30
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,839
I've made an agreement with them.

31
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:18,839
They won't mention me.

32
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,839
They'll say they needed money,

33
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,730
so they kidnapped you for ransom.

34
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,050
I'm telling you this now

35
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:29,610
because I don't want you
to panic and make Nai suspect.

36
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:34,050
But I disagree
with what you're doing.

37
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:38,639
So what do you want me to do?

38
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:42,480
If Nai finds out I worked
with the kidnappers,

39
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:43,879
he's going to get angry

40
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:46,480
and snarky with me like Nade did.

41
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,360
You have to tell him the truth.

42
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:53,079
And I'll assure him
you didn't mean it.

43
00:04:53,279 --> 00:04:55,920
You? You're going to help me?

44
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,360
I'm not helping you.

45
00:04:58,879 --> 00:05:00,480
I'm helping Nai.

46
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,959
Your actions have caused him
enough pain as it is.

47
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,800
Please tell him the truth.

48
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:14,879
And let the law deal
with Tin and his men.

49
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:19,279
As for you, you didn't do anything.
You're not guilty anyway.

50
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,920
There's nothing to be afraid of.

51
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,170
Are you sure

52
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,480
Nai isn't going to get angry
and hate me?

53
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,439
You have my word.

54
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,560
All right.

55
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,439
I will tell him the truth.

56
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:39,800
But I don't like
receiving help for free

57
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,360
because I'll be indebted to you.

58
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,480
Tell me what you want

59
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,480
in exchange for helping me.

60
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,199
- Dao.
- Yes?

61
00:06:04,279 --> 00:06:07,600
Well then. I'll change
Nick's diaper upstairs.

62
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,879
Oh, there's no need.

63
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,439
Can you wash Nick's bottom?

64
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,480
Wash his bottom?

65
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,600
That's right.

66
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,800
You said you wanted
to return the favor.

67
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,120
This is what I want you to do.

68
00:06:32,279 --> 00:06:34,759
Where are you going? Stay still.

69
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:39,199
The last time I changed
someone's diaper

70
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:41,519
was when your daddy was born.

71
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,040
It's been 20 years or so, Nick.

72
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,920
Stay still,

73
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,399
or poo-poo might fly at Granny.

74
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,839
Stay still.

75
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,480
Ah! Hold on.

76
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,680
There you are. Stay still, okay?

77
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,879
You're so tiny,
but your poo-poo really stinks.

78
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:10,759
Where are you going? Come on.

79
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,879
Do you mind if I take a video?

80
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,360
Jai told me this morning

81
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:25,959
Madame asked about Nick.

82
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:33,480
I understand now why Da told me
to let you look after Nick.

83
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,799
She knew you were going to

84
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:40,120
strengthen the relationship
between our families.

85
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,519
I wouldn't have been
able to pull it off

86
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,210
without your help.

87
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,330
What's on your mind, Pa?

88
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,600
I'm just thinking

89
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:11,519
if Da told you the truth

90
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,639
about what had happened to her
so you could help,

91
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,960
things wouldn't have

92
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,279
turned out this way.

93
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,279
Don't overthink it, Pa.

94
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:33,960
Anyway, I have to thank you

95
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,799
for believing in me.

96
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:02,879
I believe in you with all my heart.

97
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,159
I believe you're going
to do whatever it takes

98
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,240
so that both of our families
can be happy.

99
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,279
(Thom)

100
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,000
(Thom)

101
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:56,759
Even a good-for-nothing like
Thomtawee isn't interested in you.

102
00:10:58,279 --> 00:10:59,279
Dad...

103
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,519
Do you think I'm stupid?

104
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,720
You keep spending time with him

105
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:05,720
because you like him.

106
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,279
And how is it going?

107
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,240
Is he interested in you?

108
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:10,600
No.

109
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:19,919
(Thom)

110
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,360
Hello?

111
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,480
The police called. They said
they've caught the culprits

112
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,799
and they wanted us to identify them.

113
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,440
Would you be available
if I ask you to come along?

114
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,279
I'm afraid not.

115
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,519
You can handle everything
on my behalf.

116
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,840
Okay. Uh...

117
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:39,000
I have to go.
I'm in the middle of something.

118
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
Lita...

119
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,039
Thom, can you sign these, please?

120
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,799
Okay.

121
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,440
Uh...

122
00:11:58,919 --> 00:11:59,919
Ple,

123
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,360
can I ask you something?

124
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,679
Sure.

125
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,320
This is hypothetical, okay?

126
00:12:05,159 --> 00:12:08,279
What if you told a guy
you liked him?

127
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:11,240
And you asked him

128
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,080
how he feels toward you.

129
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,080
But he didn't

130
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:17,360
respond to the question at all.

131
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,360
How would you feel?

132
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:20,759
Why didn't he respond?

133
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,919
He might be in shock

134
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,879
or unsure
about his feelings toward you.

135
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,879
Then he should
at least say something

136
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,879
like asking her
to give him some time.

137
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,399
What if he said nothing?
Would you be angry?

138
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,159
I'd kick him right in the face.

139
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,200
Sign, please.

140
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,759
Okay.

141
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,120
I'll bring them to you
once I'm done.

142
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,320
Don't forget.

143
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,399
I won't.

144
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,159
- Mom.
- Yes?

145
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,799
Pa sent me this.

146
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,639
Was Madame drugged? Why is she
playing with her grandson?

147
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,279
Pa told her to wash Nick's bottom

148
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,559
in exchange for Pa's testimony.

149
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:32,799
Against that Tin?

150
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,000
That's right.

151
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,519
Can Pa be sure that

152
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,879
Madame has nothing to do with it

153
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,240
and wasn't the one
who ordered them to hurt her?

154
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:42,519
She is.

155
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,000
But she's keeping an eye on Madame

156
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,240
and how she's dealing with Tin.

157
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:58,759
- Auntie Orn. Hello
- Oh?

158
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:00,120
- Hello, there.
- Hello.

159
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:02,120
Are you about to leave?

160
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,240
Yes, I don't want to get home late.

161
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,840
Are you going to visit Nai?

162
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,519
I plan to.

163
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,039
If you run into Lita,

164
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,639
can you tell her my social media
page wants to interview her?

165
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,080
- Is she here too?
- Yes.

166
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:21,000
I ran into her just now.
She said she's visiting Nai.

167
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,799
All right. I'll tell her right away.

168
00:14:22,879 --> 00:14:24,240
Anyway, I have to go now.

169
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,519
- Bye, Auntie Orn.
- Bye.

170
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,360
- Bye.
- Bye.

171
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,960
Where's Lita?

172
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,120
She already left.

173
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,200
Thank you.

174
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,320
Oh.

175
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,120
I bought these for Uncle Panit.

176
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,399
Sorry.

177
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,039
And has she been gone long?

178
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,240
For a while now.

179
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:08,759
She just dropped by
for a visit and left

180
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,440
because she had to catch a flight.

181
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Catch a flight?

182
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,279
To where?

183
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,720
I don't know. I didn't ask.

184
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,919
But she seemed sad.

185
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:20,960
Excuse me.

186
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,320
Oh?

187
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,399
Just right here.

188
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,559
- Okay.
- Thank you very much.

189
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,679
You didn't have
to come all this way, Father.

190
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,080
Shut your mouth.

191
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,480
I'm not here to visit you.
We need to talk.

192
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:47,440
Do you know your mother
knows Tin, Pa's kidnapper?

193
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,759
How did you know about this, Uncle?

194
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,879
So this means you knew, Thom?

195
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:57,919
Huh?

196
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,559
Pa told me not to tell other people.
What do you expect me to do?

197
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:03,279
Well, I'm not other people.

198
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,320
I'm her father.

199
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:08,679
I'm also
her lawfully-wedded husband.

200
00:16:11,919 --> 00:16:13,039
- Spit it out.
- Spit it out.

201
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,960
Nick really resembles Nai.

202
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,410
Please tell him the truth.

203
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,519
And let the law deal
with Tin and his men.

204
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,890
As for you, you didn't do anything.
You're not guilty anyway.

205
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,440
There's nothing to be afraid of.

206
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,890
Are you sure

207
00:17:21,519 --> 00:17:24,079
Nai isn't going to get angry
and hate me?

208
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:26,960
You have my word.

209
00:17:52,039 --> 00:17:53,839
Pa told me

210
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,759
Madame's asked her

211
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,720
not to tell you

212
00:17:57,799 --> 00:17:59,599
because she's worried
you might be angry with her.

213
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:01,720
And did Pa agree to do that?

214
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,599
She did

215
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:08,119
in exchange
for her telling the truth

216
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,359
about that night.

217
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,920
As to whether Madame deliberately

218
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,170
left Da to die or not.

219
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:18,200
And what did Madame say?

220
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,240
She said she didn't.

221
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:24,890
That wasn't deliberate?

222
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,960
My oldest daughter died,
and the other one nearly died.

223
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,599
I won't let her unintentionally
do something

224
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,599
out of her love
for her dearest son anymore.

225
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,000
What are you going to do then?

226
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,279
Break them up.

227
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,039
You have to break up with Pa.

228
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,000
Pa won't do that, Uncle.

229
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,359
I won't either.

230
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,960
You don't have to
come up with a plan, Father.

231
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,519
Please let me deal
with my mom on my own.

232
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Nade,

233
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,039
I want to talk to you.

234
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:24,039
(Nai)

235
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:27,960
(Nai)

236
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,599
Hello, Nai?

237
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:34,200
I'm about to arrive at the hospital.
Is something the matter?

238
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:36,559
I need to talk to you

239
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:40,650
about you being the reason
behind Pa's assault.

240
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,480
How did you know?

241
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,960
Let's talk in person later.

242
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,000
You're very punctual.

243
00:19:59,079 --> 00:20:00,079
- Pa.
- Yes?

244
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,920
Have you listened to
Madame's voice clip?

245
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:03,680
What voice clip?

246
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,519
Here.

247
00:20:05,599 --> 00:20:07,920
One of your idiotic men
let Nai see his face.

248
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,240
Nai has told the police.

249
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,519
Turn yourself and your men in

250
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:14,200
and confess that
you kidnapped Pawinee

251
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:16,119
for ransom.

252
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,279
Do not mention my name.

253
00:20:17,359 --> 00:20:20,559
Don't let anyone know
that I was involved.

254
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:24,359
Where did this come from?

255
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,200
I don't know.
Someone leaked it just now.

256
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:30,119
It's going viral now.

257
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,119
(Pawinee)

258
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:48,170
(Pawinee)

259
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:51,319
I was thinking of calling you.

260
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,410
How did Nai find out?

261
00:20:54,599 --> 00:20:55,920
About what?

262
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,799
About me and Tin.

263
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,799
I think he might've
found out from the clip.

264
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,559
What clip?

265
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:05,119
A voice clip
from your conversation with Tin

266
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,559
where you offer him ten million baht
for turning himself in.

267
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,410
I called you to tell you about this.

268
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,559
Anyway, please be careful.

269
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,559
The clip's going viral.

270
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,720
Madame. Was that
your voice in the clip?

271
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,599
Can you tell us?

272
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
What clip are you talking about?

273
00:21:39,759 --> 00:21:41,559
The one where she tried
to silence the kidnapper.

274
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,519
- Was that you?
- Madame.

275
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:44,839
Don't let anyone in.

276
00:21:45,519 --> 00:21:46,519
Block the door.

Don't let anyone know

Tin's betrayed me.

286
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,519
He's probably angry

287
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:22,559
and thinks you're not
going to help him.

288

I still haven't talked to him.

How did he find out
I changed my mind?

290
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:34,160
Someone must've given him
a better offer.

291
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:38,720
Or maybe not.

292

Someone must've gotten Tin
to give them evidence against me.

Who are you referring to, Madame?

Nai.

how could you do this to me?

00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:34,279
You should've talked to me first.

I know I'm in the wrong.

I didn't expect you

Mom,

317

what if I actually
got a hold of the voice clip,

318
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,920
do you really think
I'd hurt you this way?

Do you really think
I'm that kind of person?

If you didn't leak it,

Thank you.

You were right
not to believe Madame.

She can't be trusted.

Plus, she's stingy.

326

There's no way she'd pay you
ten million baht.

00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,480
don't act
like a self-centered child.

334
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,039
We can discuss your matters later.

335
00:25:42,839 --> 00:25:44,240
It made me realize

336
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,960
who I should come and see

337
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,599
when I need help.

338
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Thank you.

339
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,880
The police said they'll tell us
once they know who leaked it.

340
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:06,160
And they've asked you
to come in for questioning.

341
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,160
We can go there now.

342
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,079
I'm ready to do so.

343
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,000
Mom, wait.

344
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,200
I want to talk to you
about us first.

345
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,680
If you're going to
tell me off about Tin,

346
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:27,119
then I'll tell you now

347
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:28,960
I didn't mean it.

348
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,160
Tin misunderstood the situation.

349
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,799
If you didn't mean it,

350
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:37,759
then why were you willing
to silence them with money?

351
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,240
I was scared.

352
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,720
I was scared you'd be angry with me

353
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,799
if you found out

354
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,279
and do something crazy
like your sister.

355
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,680
You don't know me at all.

356
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:59,440
I do. But it's because I love you.

357
00:27:00,839 --> 00:27:02,160
You're my son.

358
00:27:05,079 --> 00:27:07,039
But being your children

359
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:14,720
has caused Nade and me
more suffering

360
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,319
than happiness.

361
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,759
You seem to be also suffering

362
00:27:33,759 --> 00:27:36,359
since your children's lives aren't
going how you want them to be.

363
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,880
Maybe

364
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,799
we should try severing ties
with each other?

365
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,359
In case it might

366
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,200
help each of us be happier.

367
00:28:08,839 --> 00:28:10,319
What do you mean by that?

368
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,359
I'm sorry I'm late.
It took me a while to duck...

369
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,799
I didn't know
you were here too, Mom.

370
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,960
I guess she knows
what we're about to do.

371
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,799
Since everyone's here,

372
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:38,839
let's discuss things
and come to an agreement

373
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,839
so that the matter doesn't
have to be taken to court.

374
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,319
Taken to court?

375
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,960
What are you two thinking of doing?

376
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,119
And who is this man?

377
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:59,400
That's Sittichok. He's a lawyer.

378
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,119
We'd like to talk to him

379
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:07,960
about getting
a restraining order against you.

380
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,440
Are...

381
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,200
Are you two

382
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:27,319
thinking of disowning me?

383
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,319
No, Mom.

384
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,559
We just want to be in control
of our own lives.

385
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:41,440
We want you to stop
meaning well toward us

386
00:29:43,839 --> 00:29:46,839
because your good intentions

387
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,480
always cause us problems.

388
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:57,880
What did I ever do to you both?

389
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,799
Do we even have to tell you?

390
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,119
Just say it.

391
00:30:05,359 --> 00:30:06,599
So I'll know

392
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:08,480
and can tell you

393
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:10,240
why I had to.

394
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,960
Nade and I know
you have your reasons.

395
00:30:16,839 --> 00:30:18,559
But it's not something we want.

396
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:28,519
Please cooperate with us

397
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:31,319
so that things can end here.

398
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,200
All right.

399
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:45,240
From now on,

400
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:47,640
I won't consider

401
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,119
either of you

402
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,759
as my children.

403
00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:54,440
I'm going to take back

404
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
everything that's mine.

405
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,960
I'd like to know as well

406
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,920
if you two will survive

407
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,160
without me.

408
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:15,720
Tom.

409
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,839
- Yes?
- Please look after her.

410
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,960
I will.

411
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:03,160
- Madame, what's with the clip?
- Can you give us an answer?

412
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,880
- What was that all about?
- What's with the clip?

413
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,720
I admit

414
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,880
that it was my voice in that clip.

415
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,240
But it's not what you think.

416
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,400
Once the person
who leaked it has been caught,

417
00:32:15,599 --> 00:32:17,079
the truth will be revealed.

418
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,519
Excuse me.

419
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:21,240
Well, have you found them, Madame?

420
00:32:21,319 --> 00:32:23,680
- Madame.
- That's all for today.

421
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,720
So? Did you see any reporters?

422
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,400
I didn't. Joy brought me in
through the back.

423
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,240
Oh? And where is she?

424
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,240
She went to see my dad.

425
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:56,400
I dropped by to see you first
because I want to know

426
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,160
how you found out
about Tin and Madame.

427
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,319
Thom told me.

428
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,880
Thom?

429
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,599
It's such a big deal.
Why didn't you tell me?

430
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,519
I didn't want you to be upset.

431
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,880
And where's Madame?

432
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,480
She's probably gone
to cause a scene somewhere.

433
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:18,000
What's happened?

434
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:40,920
We want you to stop
meaning well toward us

435
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,119
because your good intentions

436
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:47,960
always cause us problems.

437
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,640
We know you have your reasons.

438
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:54,000
But it's not something we want.

439
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,599
Follow me.

440
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:01,960
- Yes, Madame.
- Yes, Madame.

441
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,559
Move everything out.

442
00:34:09,289 --> 00:34:11,119
I'm going to demolish this house.

443
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,000
How come?

444
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:14,809
This house is on my property.

445
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:17,599
I'm going to build
a chic party room.

446
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,480
Shouldn't you discuss it
with your son first?

447
00:34:21,039 --> 00:34:23,159
He and I have nothing
to do with each other anymore.

448
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:25,519
There's no need for me to care
about anyone's feelings.

449
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:28,840
If Nai's going to sue me
over the cost of his house,

450
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,440
then let him.

451
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:32,719
Yes, Madame.

452
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:34,000
Get moving!

453
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,880
- Get everything out!
- Yes.

454
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,159
- Yes, Madame.
- Yes, Madame.

455
00:34:38,809 --> 00:34:40,119
- And be quick about it.
- Yes.

456
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,329
Move everything out.

457
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:48,360
Don't try to be a smart aleck
and move only small things.

458
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,920
Move all of the furniture as well!

459
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,769
- Yes, Madame.
- Yes, Madame.

460
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
There, there.

461
00:34:56,329 --> 00:34:57,559
There, there.

462
00:34:57,639 --> 00:35:00,119
- Pick up the pace!
- Yes, Madame.

463
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:03,239
- Pit, hurry up!
- Yes!

464
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:05,639
Let's go downstairs

465
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,039
and see what's going on.

466
00:35:07,289 --> 00:35:08,559
Let's go and have a look.

467
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,719
- I said, pick up the pace.
- Yes, Madame.

468
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:15,239
Move everything out

469
00:35:15,329 --> 00:35:16,960
and throw them away.

470
00:35:17,079 --> 00:35:19,480
I don't care if you burn them
or throw them in the bin.

471
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,079
What's going on, Madame?

472
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,199
Dao,

473
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:26,079
pack your things
and leave this place.

474
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:27,960
No one's allowed to live here.

475
00:35:28,039 --> 00:35:29,329
Madame.

476
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:30,840
Please don't cry.

477
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:34,289
Why are you still standing there?
Go pack your things!

478
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,519
Madame, you're scaring Nick.

479
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:38,519
I said go and pack your things.

480
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,920
Dao.

481
00:35:40,559 --> 00:35:41,809
Hand Nick over.

482
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,440
He's scared. You have to calm down.

483
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,289
He's my grandson.

484
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,119
I'm his grandmother.
I can do anything.

485
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:49,239
Hand him over.

486
00:35:49,329 --> 00:35:51,119
Madame, please calm down.

487
00:35:51,639 --> 00:35:53,559
Jai, let me go.

488
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:54,920
- No, I can't.
- Jai.

489
00:35:55,039 --> 00:35:56,289
Madame.

490
00:35:56,289 --> 00:35:57,400
- Please calm down.
- I said let go of me.

491
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,880
- I can't, Madame.
- Please calm down.

492
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,440
Let's just talk this out.

493
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,840
- Let go of me.
- Oh.

494
00:36:03,719 --> 00:36:04,880
Erb, Phol,

495
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,000
pack your things
and leave this place.

496
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:08,159
You're fired.

497
00:36:08,559 --> 00:36:10,639
Your nephew, Trai,

498
00:36:10,719 --> 00:36:12,199
led my daughter astray.

499
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,119
Get out now.

500
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,480
Get out, all of you.

501
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:18,159
You too, Jai.

502
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,289
I'm fired too?

503
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:21,440
Get out.

504
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,679
Madame's fired everyone?

505
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:30,809
All right.

506
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:32,719
Let's do it this way, Dao.

507
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,920
Tell everyone to pack their things
and go to my dad's house.

508
00:36:36,159 --> 00:36:38,199
I'll meet you there right away.

509
00:36:39,289 --> 00:36:40,289
Okay.

510
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,880
What happened, Pa?

511
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:52,960
Madame's probably angry
with you and Nade,

512
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:56,719
so she had everything
thrown out of your house.

513
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:59,000
She fired everyone,

514
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,920
and Nick's been kicked out as well.

515
00:37:16,199 --> 00:37:17,880
Consider this a vacation, okay?

516
00:37:18,159 --> 00:37:19,400
I'll try

517
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,480
and talk to Madame.

518
00:37:21,679 --> 00:37:23,039
But how?

519
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:26,440
Well, I'll try...

520
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:29,000
- Madame's very stubborn.
- Don't cry, or I might cry too.

521
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,079
Please help us, Tom.

522
00:37:32,769 --> 00:37:34,769
Ms. Pa. You're here.

523
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,769
Ms. Pa.

524
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,599
Ms. Pa.

525
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:43,400
Please help me.

526
00:37:43,809 --> 00:37:47,159
I'm old. I don't have
anywhere else to go.

527
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,440
Maybe it's time

528
00:37:58,289 --> 00:38:01,809
Madame experienced
a life without anyone.

529
00:38:03,639 --> 00:38:04,920
It's okay, Auntie Erb.

530
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,599
Okay.

531
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:42,559
Madame,

532
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:45,400
is there anything else you want?

533
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:48,119
No,

534
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:49,639
you two can go to bed.

535
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,440
Yes, Madame.

536
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,809
I've learned more about you.

537
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:22,079
It's not that you judge
others' worth based on their wealth.

538
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:25,000
You just never see
anyone else's worth,

539
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:26,809
especially not the people
in your house.

540
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:29,400
That also includes
your children, Tom,

541
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,920
and the other employees.

542
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,960
You never see their worth either.

543
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,000
You're too talented

544
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:37,559
and too successful

545
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,329
to the point
that you see everyone weak.

546
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,199
No one's ever good
enough in your eyes.

547
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,599
You're drowning in your success

548
00:40:44,679 --> 00:40:47,289
and are unable to see
how lucky you are

549
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,519
to be surrounded by people
who are loyal to you.

550
00:40:52,329 --> 00:40:53,809
I'd like you to be prepared

551
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:57,440
because I'm going to convince
everyone to leave you soon

552
00:40:57,519 --> 00:40:59,880
so you can finally understand
that your money

553
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,599
can hire them for work,

554
00:41:01,679 --> 00:41:05,559
but you can't hire their heart
to love you like they always do.

555
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:43,880
Yes, sir?

556
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:50,079
You've found the person
who leaked the voice clip?

557
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,920
- Of course...
- Singkorn.

558
00:41:59,809 --> 00:42:00,809
Madame.

559
00:42:02,769 --> 00:42:04,329
Didn't I tell you

560
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:07,920
that I wouldn't miss the next shot?

561
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,440
What are you angry
with me about now?

562
00:42:16,599 --> 00:42:17,599
Okay.

563
00:42:17,679 --> 00:42:19,559
I give up.

564
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,329
How did you find Tin?

565
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:28,239
He came to me of his own accord.

566
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:30,840
He gave me the voice clip.

567
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:34,000
And you just helped him?

568
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,880
Well, I had no choice.

569
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:40,639
You told the others about me
taking over the company first.

570
00:42:44,159 --> 00:42:46,119
What does that even mean

571
00:42:46,199 --> 00:42:48,289
when you've already
accomplished everything anyway?

572
00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:50,440
How many times

573
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,679
have you betrayed me?

574
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:55,119
Haven't you gotten
used to it by now?

575
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,079
Had I known

576
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,329
you were going to be horrible to me,

577
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,920
I wouldn't have
let you live that day.

578
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,480
Keep the change.

579
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,440
Adisorn...

580
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,360
Krit.

581
00:43:30,719 --> 00:43:32,840
Krit.

582
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:36,119
Krit, hear me out.

583
00:43:39,039 --> 00:43:40,599
I should have listened to my mother.

584
00:43:41,159 --> 00:43:42,440
She told me not to trust you.

585
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,519
I shouldn't believe
anything you say.

586
00:43:44,840 --> 00:43:46,559
You can't be trusted at all.

587
00:43:46,639 --> 00:43:47,719
Why?

588
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,320
Is it because I'm going bankrupt?

589
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,719
That's why you have to hurry up
and find a new man for yourself.

590
00:43:54,519 --> 00:43:56,400
No, it's not true.

591
00:44:03,239 --> 00:44:04,599
Krit!

592
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:06,679
Krit!

593
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:09,000
Please listen to me.

594
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:11,360
Krit.

595
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,199
I didn't do such a thing.

596
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,920
Sunisa, put away the contracts.

597
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:27,440
I don't think we'll be
signing them anymore.

598
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:28,719
Yes, sir.

599
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:35,880
Adisorn.

600
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:39,119
I've only heard rumors about him
messing around with people's wives.

601
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:42,280
I didn't expect it would
happen to me as well.

602
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,880
But please don't be angry
with your wife.

603
00:44:46,239 --> 00:44:51,039
She did it because she wanted you
to land large projects with Adisorn.

604
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,360
Giving up my wife

605
00:44:54,239 --> 00:44:56,119
in exchange for work?

606
00:44:56,719 --> 00:44:58,199
I'd rather be in debt

607
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:59,960
than accept work from her lover.

608
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:03,599
I know

609
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,480
you didn't want me to
help Krit get the project.

610
00:45:07,519 --> 00:45:09,519
You wanted Adisorn's
project for yourself

611
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:13,280
because instead of being
my husband's assistant,

612
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,920
it helped you
become who you are today.

613
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,440
You're only successful

614
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:21,559
because of the rumor
that I committed adultery.

615
00:45:23,159 --> 00:45:24,320
Well, wasn't it true?

616
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,440
No!

617
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,480
I never slept with Adisorn.

618
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,960
You didn't?

619
00:45:32,559 --> 00:45:34,320
I made an offer,

620
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,800
and he accepted it

621
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,639
because he's a greedy pig.

622
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:40,440
I never cheated on Krit.

623
00:45:41,039 --> 00:45:42,079
Do you know why?

624
00:45:42,519 --> 00:45:44,000
Because I loved him.

625
00:45:46,639 --> 00:45:48,599
And did you tell Krit that?

626
00:45:48,679 --> 00:45:50,440
I did but he refused
to listen to me.

627
00:45:50,599 --> 00:45:52,480
He refused to trust me ever again.

628
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:54,760
Then he fell ill.

629
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,960
So I never got
the chance to tell him.

630
00:45:59,639 --> 00:46:02,000
You're the reason
why I have to bear this sin

631
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,360
and why my husband thought
I cheated on him.

632
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:08,960
After Krit's passing,

633
00:46:09,519 --> 00:46:12,440
I was the perfect assistant
to Nuansamorn,

634
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:14,480
the widow with two children
who was deep in debt.

635
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:16,760
I helped her to become
the Madame she is today.

636
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,719
Let's not do this out
of the gratitude you owe me.

637
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:25,280
Just forget whatever's in the past.

638
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,119
All right.

639
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,960
I can forget the past.

640
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:35,599
Please wait here for a moment.

641
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:36,880
Thank you.

642
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:41,639
But I can't forget about you
working with Tin

643
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:43,400
to harm me.

644
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:53,159
Anyway, I'll drag him over
as you want.

645
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:54,760
And be quick.

646
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,599
I'm dying to get back at him.

647
00:46:58,519 --> 00:46:59,519
No problem.

648
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:03,199
And I'm sorry

649
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:05,559
if I went too far.

650
00:47:28,239 --> 00:47:29,480
Scumbags.

651
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:30,920
They were at each other's throats.

652
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:32,599
Now they're shaking hands.

653
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,239
Who's here? Let's see.

654
00:47:37,519 --> 00:47:39,679
Who do you think is here?

655
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,199
They're here.

656
00:47:43,039 --> 00:47:46,360
- Look who's here.
- They've arrived.

657
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,039
There they are.

658
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:52,079
We'll go and get your car
after we've eaten, okay?

659
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,840
- Hello.
- Hello.

660
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,360
Welcome home, Sir, Mr. Nai.

661
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,760
Thank you.

662
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,840
Has the place
been treating you well?

663
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,039
Of course. It's very nice here.

664
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:07,039
Sir, the car wouldn't start,
so I brought it to the shop.

665
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:08,239
- Oh.
- That's right.

666
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:10,000
- Thank you, Phol.
- You're welcome. And hello again.

667
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,079
Look, it's Nick.

668
00:48:14,159 --> 00:48:15,199
Hey, there.

669
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,480
- Hello.
- Hi, Nick.

670
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:19,760
- How has he been doing?
- He's eating so well.

671
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,840
That's right.

672
00:48:22,840 --> 00:48:24,960
Nibbles?

673
00:48:25,519 --> 00:48:27,280
Let Daddy nibble you?

674
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,119
And what about Nade and Trai?
Where are they?

675
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,480
- Orange juice.
- Would you like some orange juice?

676
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:44,119
Sweet and refreshing orange juice.
Three bottles for 100.

677
00:48:44,679 --> 00:48:46,079
Only 35 baht a bottle.

678
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:48,719
Hey, there. Interested
in some orange juice?

679
00:48:50,119 --> 00:48:51,679
- Three bottles for 100.
- Three bottles for 100.

680
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,320
Come on in. It's really nice.

681
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,480
Nice and refreshing orange juice.

682
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,760
Oh, Mr. Nai? You're back.

683
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,400
How's business, Trai?

684
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,199
It's going relatively smoothly.

685
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,559
It's good you're here.

686
00:49:07,559 --> 00:49:09,519
Can you help me out?
I have to go and sit down for a bit.

687
00:49:26,719 --> 00:49:27,719
Trai,

688
00:49:28,719 --> 00:49:31,360
can you tell me now why you brought
my sister here, slaving away?

689
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:35,039
I want her to realize

690
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:36,960
that if she wants to be with me,

691
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:41,119
I can't give her the comfortable
lifestyle she's used to.

692
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:45,039
I'm okay if she ends up
not being able to put up with it

693
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:47,199
and wants to break up.

694
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:56,840
I'll help.

695
00:49:57,079 --> 00:49:58,079
Thank you.

696
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,719
It's so sunny.

697
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:10,400
I'll need premium-grade sunscreen.

698
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,239
But it's expensive.

699
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,360
I can't afford it.

700
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:26,920
If you'd known you'd have to
go through this in advance,

701
00:50:28,639 --> 00:50:29,840
would you have
still fallen in love with Trai?

702
00:50:32,239 --> 00:50:33,840
I'm not an angel, Nai.

703
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:36,880
It's impossible for me to think
I can handle all the hardships

704
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:38,719
as long as I'm with
the person I love.

705
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:44,800
But I can't turn back time,

706
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:47,639
and I really am in love with him.

707
00:50:51,239 --> 00:50:53,360
I have to keep moving forward.

708
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:12,239
I'll let you take five, Ms. Nade.

709
00:51:13,119 --> 00:51:14,119
Okay.

710
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,440
All right.

711
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,719
Orange juice. Fresh orange juice.

712
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,920
Sweet and refreshing.

713
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:31,320
Three bottles for 100.

714
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:34,440
- Can I buy some, please?
- We've got a customer!

715
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,000
- Here's a customer, Nade.
- How many bottles would you like?

716
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:38,920
- Six, please.
- Six. Wow.

717
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,039
- Six bottles?
- Yes.

718
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,679
- It's 200 baht, please.
- Nade.

719
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,039
Would you like seven instead?

720
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:49,679
All right. I'll take seven.
How much is it?

721
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,760
Can I transfer the money to you?

722
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,000
Oh, of course.

723
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,000
- The QR code!
- I'll find it. Seven bottles.

724
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,440
Dad.

725
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,639
Calm down. I'm sorry.

726
00:52:26,719 --> 00:52:29,400
It's okay. I'm fine now.

727
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,920
Jai told me

728
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:35,960
there's something
you want to talk to me about.

729
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:38,000
So when are you going
to break up with Nai?

730
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,480
- Break up?
- Yes.

731
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:44,559
Thom told me you were going
to break up with him.

732
00:52:48,679 --> 00:52:49,679
Pa.

733
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,760
Why the long face?

734
00:52:52,519 --> 00:52:53,639
Did something happen?

735
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:57,480
I'm caught in a dilemma.

736
00:52:58,519 --> 00:53:01,639
Should I keep trying
to win Madame Nuan over?

737
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:07,360
Or should I just
break up with Nai, Thom?

738
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:10,800
What happened, Pa?

739
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,320
Yes, I thought about it.

740
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:18,400
You were right, Pa.

741
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,679
Your life can still
go a lot further.

742
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,280
Don't stay close to someone who
won't open up their heart to you.

743
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:25,599
It's a waste of time.

744
00:53:26,840 --> 00:53:30,320
Dad, I thought you said you wanted
Nai as your son-in-law.

745
00:53:30,639 --> 00:53:31,880
Hey.

746
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:37,679
That was before I learned
that Madame ordered Tin to hurt you.

747
00:53:39,519 --> 00:53:40,519
Dad,

748
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,920
she didn't mean it.

749
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:47,800
You can believe her
all you want, but I don't.

750
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:49,679
Madame's a treacherous snake.

751
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,960
She probably set something up
to convince you she didn't mean it.

752
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,800
When I heard that from Thom,

753
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,920
I was very happy.

754
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,760
I'm happy you've finally realized

755
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:05,440
you shouldn't be her in-law.

756
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:09,960
I guess you're waiting for Nai
to recover before you tell him.

757
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,840
That's good. Let him experience
one type of pain at a time.

758
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,599
If you tell him now,

759
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:16,519
he'd have to go through both
physical and emotional pain.

760
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:17,639
He might die from that.

761
00:54:23,079 --> 00:54:24,719
Thanks so much, Pa.

762
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,880
Thanks so much.
Now I can finally rest in peace.

763
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,199
Right. Pull up a chair.

764
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:35,920
Sit down and watch
the scenery with me.

765
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:38,679
Have a seat.

766
00:54:39,559 --> 00:54:40,559
There you go.

767
00:54:40,920 --> 00:54:42,360
Look at the water level rising.

768
00:54:49,039 --> 00:54:52,039
Why didn't you tell Uncle Nit
you've changed your mind

769
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:54,000
and aren't going to break up
with Nai anymore?

770
00:54:54,960 --> 00:54:56,000
Come on, Joy.

771
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:58,559
If you saw the look on Dad's face,

772
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:01,599
you'd understand
why I was at a loss for words.

773
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,760
The last time I saw him that happy

774
00:55:05,199 --> 00:55:08,239
was when Da won a national award
for her manners and etiquette.

775
00:55:10,599 --> 00:55:12,360
But I understand him.

776
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,679
Madame was the reason
his oldest daughter died.

777
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:19,119
And his other daughter
nearly died as well.

778
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:21,719
Joy,

779
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:26,239
you don't believe Madame didn't
order Tin to hurt me either?

780
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,880
Honestly, I'm on the same
wavelength as Uncle Nit.

781
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,199
It's difficult for me to believe
Madame didn't mean it.

782
00:55:56,679 --> 00:55:57,679
Yes, Father?

783
00:56:02,159 --> 00:56:04,119
These are from my collection.

784
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,400
And I'd like you to have them.

785
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:14,760
Books on Buddhism.

786
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,079
- The CD too?
- Yes.

787
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,599
I enjoy studying
the Buddha's teachings.

788
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:23,559
It gave me peace of mind.

789
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:27,119
And it helped me learn the phrase

790
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:30,639
"letting go."

791
00:56:34,239 --> 00:56:36,000
Is there anything
I should be letting go?

792
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:41,599
We can't possibly know what's
going to happen in the future.

793
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:45,760
We can only be prepared
and remain vigilant

794
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,039
for the suffering that will
eventually come into our lives.

795
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,440
Let it go, all right?

796
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,639
All done.

797
00:57:17,719 --> 00:57:19,599
Your wound's dried up now.

798
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:26,119
Pa,

799
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,320
your dad said
some strange things to me.

800
00:57:31,679 --> 00:57:33,039
What did he say?

801
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,920
He told me

802
00:57:35,639 --> 00:57:36,920
he wants me to
come to terms with it,

803
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:38,719
accept reality, and let it go.

804
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:41,079
See?

805
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,079
He brought me heaps of
books and CDs on Buddhism.

806
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:47,039
Uh...

807
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:51,079
I guess he feels

808
00:57:51,519 --> 00:57:53,679
like he just went through
a matter of life and death

809
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:55,719
and has accepted
the impermanence of life.

810
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:58,360
So maybe he wants to
to share it with others too?

811
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:02,079
But it sounded as if he knew
something bad was going to happen.

812
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,880
Nai,

813
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:14,679
I'm right here

814
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,119
with you now.

815
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:20,519
And I will do whatever it takes

816
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,639
to prevent anything horrible
from happening to you,

817
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:25,360
okay?

818
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,199
Hearing you say that,

819
00:58:29,159 --> 00:58:31,280
I'm even more sure
there's something going on.

820
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:36,199
But I'll believe you
for your own peace of mind.

821
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,559
And I really like it when
you're cute with me like this.

822
00:59:08,039 --> 00:59:09,400
I'm not doing it anymore!

823
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:11,079
Please calm down.

824
00:59:19,480 --> 00:59:21,280
Just take it slow, okay?

825
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,000
What happened?

826
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,800
Ms. Nade tried to sell her clothes
on a live stream.

827
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,840
But there were only five viewers.

828
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:35,280
Three of the five were Auntie Orn,
Auntie Erb, and Uncle Phol.

829
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:36,599
So she ended the live stream.
Just like that.

830
00:59:39,239 --> 00:59:40,760
Well, Mr. Nai was asking a question.

831
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:47,280
Nade,

832
00:59:48,519 --> 00:59:50,480
you have to take it easy
and be patient.

833
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:53,079
No one is successful
on their first day.

834
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:06,599
Excuse me, Nai.

835
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,440
I think

836
01:00:16,599 --> 01:00:18,440
you might want to try
changing the page name.

837
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:22,639
A page called "Nadedao" might not
attract that much interest.

838
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,159
I should change the page name?

839
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,840
You are now watching

840
01:00:34,840 --> 01:00:37,480
Nadedao Haosamhon the Newbie Pauper

841
01:00:37,519 --> 01:00:40,159
With Great Attention to Detail
and Fashion Look,

842
01:00:40,159 --> 01:00:43,719
- Wearable for the Whole Family...
- That's enough!

843
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:49,599
All right. There's going to be
a massive discount today

844
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:52,559
since this is our page's first day.

845
01:00:52,639 --> 01:00:54,400
All right. Let's start
with the smaller items!

846
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,559
Glittering grandiose gold,
here we go!

847
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:01,280
I'm already happy to see
Nade doing something by herself.

848
01:01:02,679 --> 01:01:05,880
I'm sure she'll be successful too.

849
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,880
What do you think of the page name?

850
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:10,440
Cool.

851
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,280
You'll catch people's eyes
from across the street.

852
01:01:16,360 --> 01:01:19,360
This only costs a few hundred,

853
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:22,360
but it'll feel like you're wearing
something that costs ten thousand.

854
01:01:23,159 --> 01:01:25,519
Don't you think?
You can't find such a deal anywhere.

855
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:27,960
If you're still not happy,
try adding some flowers.

856
01:01:28,039 --> 01:01:30,119
- Is that a good idea?
- It'll stand out even more.

857
01:01:30,199 --> 01:01:31,280
Are you sure?
This already stands out.

858
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,239
Pa. Can you join and buy
something from her?

859
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:35,400
I'm selling them cheap

860
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,880
even though they're
practically expensive.

861
01:01:38,719 --> 01:01:41,280
Oh, we have a potential buyer.

862
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:42,360
That's very quick.

863
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:43,920
Tha-ngan.

864
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:46,719
- Tha-ngan?
- Where are you from, Tha-ngan?

865
01:01:47,159 --> 01:01:49,920
She's confirmed the order.

866
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:51,000
Thank you.

867
01:01:51,079 --> 01:01:52,519
Thank you, Tha-ngan.

868
01:01:52,599 --> 01:01:53,800
Next item, please.

869
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,719
We've got 150 viewers today.
So, as promised,

870
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,280
- here's the first item.
- Come on!

871
01:01:59,320 --> 01:02:00,519
A dress with a sexy Santa vibe.

872
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:01,880
Nice and bright.

873
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:04,519
Brightly colored and pretty.

874
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:08,559
The retail price when I bought it
was 4,500 baht.

875
01:02:08,679 --> 01:02:10,440
- Whoa.
- But if anyone wants it,

876
01:02:10,519 --> 01:02:14,360
I'm only selling it for 2,500 today.

877
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:16,280
- Wow.
- That's so cheap.

878
01:02:16,480 --> 01:02:19,000
Yes, another order confirmed.

879
01:02:19,119 --> 01:02:20,119
Mind.

880
01:02:20,239 --> 01:02:22,119
Is it Mindski?

881
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:25,360
- There it is.
- There it is.

882
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,679
What do you think? A luxury bag.

883
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,960
A bit like a socialite's daughter
who's fallen from grace.

884
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:34,440
You can hang it off your arms
or shoulders. Very chic.

885
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,039
See? A long-sleeved,
knee-high dress.

886
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:41,039
The cut is super posh.

887
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,960
We're selling it for...

888
01:02:44,239 --> 01:02:47,000
- eight-hundred baht.
- That's so cheap.

889
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:49,599
- Yay.
- Wow.

890
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:54,639
There are 500 of you. So we've got
a special promotion as promised.

891
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:56,440
Send it in.

892
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:58,800
Ta-da.

893
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,400
Extra special.

894
01:03:01,519 --> 01:03:03,840
You're offering 1,010 baht?
No, that's cheating.

895
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:06,079
Is that 1,500 I'm seeing?

896
01:03:06,159 --> 01:03:07,159
Huh? 2,000?

897
01:03:08,679 --> 01:03:09,840
Mr. Panit.

898
01:03:10,239 --> 01:03:12,639
You've been watching every day.
Would you like to help?

899
01:03:15,239 --> 01:03:18,880
There's a special promotion today!

900
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,559
Pomelo.

901
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:22,480
Perfectly ripe pomelo.

902
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:25,639
Pesticide-free with smooth skin
because I grew them myself.

903
01:03:25,639 --> 01:03:28,480
Sweet and refreshing pomelo.

904
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:31,920
With the purchase
of an outfit and a bag,

905
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:36,519
you can get three pomelos for free.

906
01:03:39,239 --> 01:03:41,920
- Bring on the music.
- Clap your hands.

907
01:03:42,039 --> 01:03:45,159
Here it is.

908
01:04:18,519 --> 01:04:22,280
Thom, Dad asked me to invite you
to a party to celebrate the sales.

909
01:04:22,360 --> 01:04:23,519
Let's have Moo Krata.

910
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:25,519
What sales?

911
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:28,679
The sales from Nade's clothing
and Dad's fruit.

912
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:31,159
- Oh.
- He asked me to invite you.

913
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:36,039
Uh, I have a meeting
with a client tomorrow.

914
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:38,239
But I'll catch up with you
if I finish early.

915
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,000
Okay.

916
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:41,960
Thom,

917
01:04:42,199 --> 01:04:43,599
Ta's here to see you.

918
01:04:44,159 --> 01:04:45,199
Lita?

919
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:49,000
- Thanks so much.
- Wait...

920
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,119
Wait, Thom.

921
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,079
Lita.

922
01:05:09,079 --> 01:05:10,199
- Hello.
- Hello.

923
01:05:11,199 --> 01:05:12,199
Tawarn.

924
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:16,440
- Uh, Aon.
- Yes?

925
01:05:16,519 --> 01:05:18,639
She's a new recruit at our company.

926
01:05:19,199 --> 01:05:21,280
Can you show her to her desk?

927
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:22,360
Of course.

928
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:24,360
- This way, please.
- Please.

929
01:05:24,440 --> 01:05:25,440
Thank you.

930
01:05:30,239 --> 01:05:32,840
Are you expecting Lita?

931
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,000
Yes.

932
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:41,639
Well, I wasn't behaving
very nicely to her.

933
01:05:41,719 --> 01:05:42,960
So she...

934
01:05:43,559 --> 01:05:44,639
got angry with me.

935
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,280
And now she's
refusing to talk to me.

936
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:50,000
And what did you do to her?

937
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:51,559
Well,

938
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:54,920
she told me

939
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:57,320
she...

940
01:05:59,280 --> 01:06:00,360
She has feelings for me.

941
01:06:02,719 --> 01:06:03,719
And?

942
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:08,639
And she asked me
how I felt toward her.

943
01:06:09,239 --> 01:06:12,119
But I didn't get the chance
to answer her.

944
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:15,400
Something happened,
so I walked away.

945
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,840
And why did you do that to her?

946
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:19,239
Well, I wasn't sure

947
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:22,840
how I felt toward her at the time.

948
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,960
Does that mean you are now?
Is that why you want to see her?

949
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:36,440
Hurry up and find her now.

950
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:39,400
I'm dying to have a sister-in-law,

951
01:06:39,559 --> 01:06:40,559
okay?

952
01:06:41,119 --> 01:06:42,159
Okay.

953
01:07:06,199 --> 01:07:07,639
What are you up to?

954
01:07:35,199 --> 01:07:36,480
They're probably gone now.

955
01:07:37,519 --> 01:07:38,519
I think we should...

956
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:47,000
I'm going to do everything
to get us out safely.

957
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,840
You thought

958
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,519
Nade has a crush on you.

959
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,519
You were wrong.

960
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:09,199
In fact,

961
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:11,800
the person who has a crush on you

962
01:08:14,320 --> 01:08:15,400
is me.

963
01:08:24,680 --> 01:08:26,399
Do you think it's possible

964
01:08:29,159 --> 01:08:30,479
or impossible

965
01:08:31,239 --> 01:08:32,649
between us?

966
01:09:03,529 --> 01:09:04,529
Madame?

967
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,039
- Oh my gosh.
- Oh my gosh.

968
01:09:09,399 --> 01:09:10,529
Madame.

969
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,720
How dare you
try to hurt Pa on our turf?

970
01:09:12,800 --> 01:09:13,960
Are you breaking up with me?

971
01:09:14,039 --> 01:09:15,039
Yes, she is.

972
01:09:15,039 --> 01:09:17,529
My daughter isn't stupid enough to
be that witch's daughter-in-law.

973
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:19,319
I don't want you
as my daughter-in-law.

974
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:22,119
I heard everyone
turned their back on you.

975
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:23,199
What do you want?

976
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,159
What have you done to Madame?

977
01:09:25,159 --> 01:09:26,880
Bring me 20 million baht in cash.

978
01:09:27,239 --> 01:09:28,920
I'm sure Madame Nuan is lying.

979
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,760
I don't know if it's true or not

980
01:09:31,199 --> 01:09:32,609
but I have to check on her.

981
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:35,609
Mom.
