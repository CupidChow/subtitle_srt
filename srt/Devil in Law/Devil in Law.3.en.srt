1
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,159
Don't fall in love with him.

2
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:37,319
There's no way
I'm going to fall for him.

3
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,759
I always have a soft spot
for defiant ones like you.

4
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,000
It's my first day here,

5
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,400
and she already
dumped mop water on me.

6
00:02:44,479 --> 00:02:46,400
Da lived there for a while. You can
figure out how harsh it was.

7
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,960
This is only the beginning.

8
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:50,120
I want to apply
for a job at your company.

9
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:52,439
Have you finally managed
to forget about that?

10
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,840
It's Nade who's wasting electricity.

11
00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,520
You continue to talk
to that foreigner

12
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:00,919
and flash him your breasts.

13
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,639
Pawinee!

14
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,280
Do you miss your dad, Nick?

15
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,560
He wants to know if you miss him.

16
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:11,639
"I miss you. I miss you very much."

17
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:15,639
Good job.
You just answered your dad.

18
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:18,680
By the way, what is Pa doing?

19
00:03:18,759 --> 00:03:22,719
Ms. Pa is meeting Madame
at the main house.

20
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
I believe they are talking
about some electricity bills.

21
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,879
What electricity bills?

22
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,000
I'm not sure.

23
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,639
It's fortunate that
Nick is a calm and obedient boy.

24
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,879
Otherwise, I'd be running around
right now. Am I right?

25
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,680
Look at how handsome you are, Nick.

26
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,240
You will be handsome like your dad.

27
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,120
Pawinee!

28
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,960
Wasn't that Nade's voice?

29
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,199
It's coming from outside.

30
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,479
Hold on.

31
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,960
- What a tattletale.
- Ms. Nade, don't do this.

32
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,919
- You are a tattletale.
- Hey.

33
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,520
Ms. Nade, no.

34
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,599
Ms. Nade!

35
00:03:57,639 --> 00:03:58,639
Have you gone crazy?

36
00:03:58,759 --> 00:04:00,360
Mom slapped me because of you.

37
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,840
Ms. Pa! Stop it!

38
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:03,919
Ms. Pa!

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,199
Get off me. What's your problem?

40
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,439
Don't hang up yet.

41
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,039
Show me what's happening.

42
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,479
Nick, I'll be right back.

43
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:16,639
Nick.

44
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,730
Nick, hey there.

45
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,199
Come to me.

46
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,680
Ms. Nade!

47
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,879
Ms. Nade!

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,730
Where do you think you are going?

49
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,759
Stop right there.

50
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:39,800
You.

51
00:04:40,959 --> 00:04:41,959
Stop it.

52
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
Ms. Nade!

53
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,519
Ms. Nade!

54
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,439
Stop it!

55
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Stop it!

56
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,680
Why did you push me?

57
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,730
What on earth are you doing?

58
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,439
Stop it.

59
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:11,050
Stop.

60
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,759
I'm not going to slap you back

61
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,399
because I pity you
for getting slapped by your mother.

62
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,959
But if you slapped me because
I was the reason you got hurt,

63
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,480
then I'm telling you now
that I'm also getting back at you

64
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,199
for abusing my sister.

65
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:24,839
Keep that in mind,

66
00:05:25,079 --> 00:05:26,199
Ms. Sister-in-law.

67
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:28,639
I'm still not done with you.

68
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,680
Ms. Nade is picking a fight
with Ms. Pawinee.

69
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,160
Madame, they are going at it
like there's no tomorrow.

70
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,800
Aren't you going to stop them?

71
00:05:44,079 --> 00:05:45,079
Let them be.

72
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,879
It will make Nai realize

73
00:05:48,079 --> 00:05:50,079
that Pawinee is causing problems
for our family.

74
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,879
I'm not trying
to be a hero or anything,

75
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,959
but I can't stand it
when people fight or use violence.

76
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,600
I'm going to stop them.

77
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,600
You.

78
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,600
Let go of me.

79
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,439
Stop it. Stop it this instant.

80
00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:15,519
Stop!

81
00:06:15,839 --> 00:06:16,959
I said stop!

82
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,120
But if you slapped me because
I was the reason you got hurt,

83
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,240
then I'm telling you now
that I'm also getting back at you

84
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,920
for abusing my sister.

85
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:35,120
Keep that in mind,
Ms. Sister-in-law.

86
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm still not done with you.

87
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:42,439
Ms. Pa and Ms. Nade had a catfight?

88
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:43,759
Yes.

89
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,959
Instead of helping us separate them,

90
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,040
you were peacefully sleeping.

91
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,680
Hey, leave my nephew alone.

92
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,480
What? It's true.

93
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,279
All we had were women and elders.

94
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,720
Anyway, how were we supposed
to stop them by ourselves?

95
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
Mr. Nai would have jumped out
from the video call if he could.

96
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,120
What's wrong?

97
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:11,199
- Drink this.
- Nai saw the whole thing?

98
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,879
Yes, we were on a video call.

99
00:07:14,439 --> 00:07:15,800
Oh dear.

100
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:19,120
Deer? There were no deer.
Only a few people got hurt.

101
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,560
I know there were no deer.
But I'm so dead.

102
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:23,120
What?

103
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,399
The fight is over.
It's no use going there now.

104
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,439
(Trai)

105
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:39,439
- Hello.
- Hello, Nai.

106
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,360
I was really sleepy last night.

107
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:43,439
I took a nap and fell deeply asleep.

108
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,920
I passed out.

109
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,279
Not another word, Trai.

110
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,759
I'm going home.

111
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,160
You are coming home?

112
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,360
Yes, I've decided.

113
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,920
I can't leave Pa alone
with my mother and Nade.

114
00:07:58,199 --> 00:07:59,240
I'm quitting my job.

115
00:08:21,279 --> 00:08:22,800
Dao.

116
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:28,120
Can you turn on the air-con?
It's really hot.

117
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:31,600
I set the timer to turn off
the air-con hours ago.

118
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,159
Nai?

119
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:49,879
How did you get inside?

120
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,120
This is my private space.

121
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:55,159
I told you that you weren't allowed
to enter without my permission.

122
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,679
Dao, Trai, and Jai are downstairs.

123
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,879
They wanted me to check on you.

124
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:03,120
What was I supposed to say?

125
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,039
"Oh, I can't enter the room."

126
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,960
"Her husband is not allowed
in the bedroom."

127
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,480
Like that?

128
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,679
Dao said you had a fever.

129
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,480
How are you feeling?

130
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,240
Stop.

131
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,330
Go sit over there.

132
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:27,360
Stop.

133
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,840
All the way there.

134
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,519
Sit.

135
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:40,639
I'm fine now.

136
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:44,210
Why are you back so soon?

137
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:45,879
I thought you'd be gone for a while.

138
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,240
I've decided not to leave you
alone with my mother

139
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,000
and Nade.

140
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:52,759
I'm not going to kill them.

141
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,330
I'm not so certain.

142
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,879
People do things
in the heat of the moment.

143
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,240
I've talked to my mother

144
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,000
about making Da pay the bills.

145
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,159
Stop.

146
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,450
What are you doing?

147
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,450
Put it down.

148
00:10:18,919 --> 00:10:20,279
What is it?

149
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,159
It's proof why my mother
made Da pay the electricity bills.

150
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:31,919
I didn't want Srikanda
to feel like an outsider.

151
00:10:32,639 --> 00:10:35,450
Helping out with utility bills

152
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:39,240
was a good way
to make her feel worthy of herself.

153
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:44,360
When I married into
your father's family,

154
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,090
I didn't have to pay for anything.

155
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,759
And because of that, it didn't feel
like I belonged in the house.

156
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,799
I had to walk on eggshells
around people.

157
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,000
However, I never actually
used Srikanda's money

158
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,279
to pay the bills.

159
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,879
I put her money in the bank

160
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,000
for Nick's education.

161
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,440
The envelope contains
previous electricity bills,

162
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:12,360
dating from the month
Da started paying.

163
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,000
The numbers match the transactions
deposited into the saving account

164
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,720
each month.

165
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,240
I didn't know you had been
putting Da's money

166
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,200
in the bank.

167
00:11:39,559 --> 00:11:40,960
The weapon

168
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:43,519
that makes you win

169
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:44,960
in a war

170
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:47,360
is discretion.

171
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,960
Do you really believe

172
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,480
that Madame Nuan
was looking out for Da?

173
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,240
Why shouldn't I believe her?

174
00:12:04,799 --> 00:12:07,159
Because anyone could see
a big fat liar like your mother

175
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,240
from outer space.

176
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:13,039
Pa.

177
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,360
If Madame Nuan
was in fact looking out for Da

178
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:25,639
and wanted Da
to feel included in the family,

179
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,519
why not just be honest
with each other?

180
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:29,559
She could have talked to Da.

181
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,799
Why use her words to abuse Da

182
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:35,000
and tie Da's hands
into paying the bills?

183
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,159
Were you there

184
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,519
when my mother insulted her?

185
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,480
No.

186
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,200
But Dao told me what happened.

187
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:48,120
Why should we believe people's words

188
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:51,440
when neither of us was there?

189
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,639
But you believe Madame Nuan

190
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,919
who sent Da to die
by locking her up?

191
00:12:57,039 --> 00:13:00,279
You believe your mother more than
Dao who actually meant Da well?

192
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,000
I'm not saying I believe anyone.

193
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,320
But it's in the past.

194
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,600
We should let it go.

195
00:13:07,159 --> 00:13:08,320
I'll let it go

196
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:11,399
when you admit

197
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:15,519
that your mother and sister
are terrible people.

198
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:21,759
And you must make them
apologize to Da's spirit.

199
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,360
Unless you do that,

200
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,879
we'll continue to live this way.

201
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,159
It's fun.

202
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:49,879
Joy.

203
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,000
Why's Pa so upset?

204
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:58,960
She's having problems
with Madame Nuan.

205
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,799
She just got married but already
has problems with her mother-in-law?

206
00:14:02,879 --> 00:14:04,679
Pa's mother-in-law

207
00:14:04,759 --> 00:14:07,240
is nowhere near as kind as you are.

208
00:14:07,799 --> 00:14:09,480
Mother.

209
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,000
Am I right, Mother?

210
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,919
I told you not to call me
your mother-in-law.

211
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
If people hear you,
they might think you are a widow.

212
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,039
No one wants to marry a widow.

213
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,039
Plus, Art died before
he legally married you.

214
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:33,480
But I treat and love you
like a mother-in-law.

215
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,799
Otherwise, I wouldn't be living
with you on behalf of Art.

216
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,960
Gosh, listen to you.

217
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:45,480
Here.

218
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,840
Take it to that house.

219
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:49,879
It tastes best when hot.

220
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,840
Okay.

221
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,639
- Take it.
- Wow.

222
00:15:05,159 --> 00:15:06,639
Pa.

223
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:11,320
You won't stop until Uncle Nit comes
out to check on you, will you?

224
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,600
What are you going to do next?

225
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:21,799
I'll keep trying to make Nai see
who his mother really is.

226
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:26,039
But I can't use what Madame Nuan did
to Da against her anymore

227
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,039
since she probably made sure things
could not be traced back to her.

228
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,639
How are you going to do that?

229
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,080
I don't know, Joy.
I don't have an idea yet.

230
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,000
But I'm sure there's a way.

231
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:41,600
Yes.

232
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,080
Nai.

233
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:50,759
Why didn't you talk to me
before quitting your job?

234
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,279
I thought it through.

235
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:56,440
I want to be here for Nick
as he grows up.

236
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:01,360
What kind of work are you going to
do? Do you need my connections?

237
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,120
No, thank you.

238
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,000
I'd prefer to do this on my own.

239
00:16:05,559 --> 00:16:10,080
It took me years to get everyone's
approval at the last job

240
00:16:10,159 --> 00:16:12,039
that you got me.

241
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,600
By the way, do you remember

242
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:19,039
my senior named Kee?

243
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:20,960
Yes.

244
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,960
He went abroad to study advertising.

245
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:25,519
That's right.

246
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:28,120
He asked if I want to set up
an organizing company with him.

247
00:16:29,919 --> 00:16:31,720
But you didn't study in this field.

248
00:16:32,679 --> 00:16:34,600
It's not too late to start learning.

249
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:36,799
I like advertising.

250
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:39,679
I always participated in activities
involved with advertising at school.

251
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,480
Up to you then.

252
00:16:42,559 --> 00:16:44,080
Let me know if you need my help.

253
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:46,960
Moral support
is all I need from you.

254
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,240
Come inside for some snacks.

255
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,159
Sure, let's go.

256
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:03,320
Pa. Joy.

257
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,559
Nai, hello.

258
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,519
- Thank you for driving Pa home.
- No problem.

259
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,359
Pa.

260
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,279
When are you going to buy a car?

261
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,359
Stop bothering Joy already.

262
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,240
It's fine, Nai.

263
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,200
How about I buy you a car?

264
00:17:29,319 --> 00:17:30,319
That sounds great.

265
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,599
But I don't want one now.

266
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,799
I thought you'd turn me down.

267
00:17:35,759 --> 00:17:37,920
Why bother?

268
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,200
It will drive your mother

269
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,559
and sister insane
if you buy me a car.

270
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,319
You can think again

271
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,599
whether or not you still want
to buy me a car.

272
00:17:49,759 --> 00:17:50,890
It's not a problem.

273
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,279
Just don't pick an expensive car.
I just lost my job.

274
00:18:00,359 --> 00:18:02,039
- He lost his job?
- Yes.

275
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,960
Go talk to him.

276
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,170
Okay.

277
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
Nai.

278
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:14,359
Nai.

279
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:18,319
Did you quit your job?

280
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,559
Yes.

281
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,240
Does this mean you are going
to sleep at home every day?

282
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,039
What's wrong?

283
00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:26,839
Are you scared of me?

284
00:18:27,839 --> 00:18:28,839
No.

285
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,039
I just don't want to see
your face every day.

286
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:35,650
Oh my!

287
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,119
Let go.

288
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,170
Don't touch me.

289
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:57,240
You told me not to touch you.

290
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,319
- Dao.
- What?

291
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,410
Don't you think

292
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,519
that something seems off
with Nai and Pa?

293
00:19:18,599 --> 00:19:20,079
Sit properly.

294
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,960
Okay.

295
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,440
What do you mean?

296
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,170
To me,

297
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:28,170
Nai and Pa don't act
like a married couple.

298
00:19:28,839 --> 00:19:30,720
It's nothing like
when Da was around.

299
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:34,720
Nai and Da were madly in love.

300
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,000
Maybe Ms. Pa doesn't feel
comfortable expressing her love.

301
00:19:39,599 --> 00:19:40,839
I don't think it's that.

302
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,759
Something doesn't seem right, Dao.

303
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,519
What do you think about this?

304
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,410
What makes them suspect

305
00:19:50,599 --> 00:19:53,359
that Nai and Pa aren't
really married?

306
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:55,000
Well.

307
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:56,839
Trai didn't mention it,

308
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,170
but I'm guessing he saw something.

309
00:19:59,759 --> 00:20:01,599
Do you want me to ask him?

310
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,799
No.

311
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,480
You will mess it up again.

312
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,000
Bring Trai here.
I'll question him myself.

313
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:10,920
Yes.

314
00:20:13,359 --> 00:20:14,680
The weapon

315
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:17,279
that makes you win

316
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:18,720
in a war

317
00:20:19,759 --> 00:20:21,079
is discretion.

318
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,720
- Wait.
- Yes.

319
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,559
Don't bring him here.

320
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,960
One of Pawinee's rats might
overhear the conversation.

321
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,410
Where should I bring Trai then?

322
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:47,410
Come here quickly.

323
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,890
What business do you have with me?

324
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:54,359
I hear you're suspicious of

325
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:59,519
Nai and Pawinee's relationship.

326
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,960
You think they are hiding something.

327
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,839
What makes you think that?

328
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:08,359
I'm naturally a doubtful person.

329
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
Don't worry about it.

330
00:21:09,519 --> 00:21:10,890
I don't believe you.

331
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,079
How about this?

332
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:17,170
If you manage to fetch me evidence

333
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,119
proving that Pawinee and Nai
aren't actually in love,

334
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,240
I will reward you with money.

335
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,039
The price is based
on the quality of evidence.

336
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:32,319
I usually pay generously.

337
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,119
There's one condition though.

338
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,650
You cannot tell anyone about this.
Do we have a deal?

339
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,200
It's a deal.

340
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,890
Money happens to be tight now.

341
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:46,319
- Score!
- Score!

342
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:49,170
We won!

343
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,359
Darn it.

344
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,559
What's wrong?

345
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,279
I bet for the other team.

346
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,960
- What did you say?
- Oh.

347
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,160
It's hot out here, Ms. Nade.

348
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,920
Why do we have to talk here?

349
00:22:05,319 --> 00:22:06,359
We could have talked inside.

350
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:13,039
The weapon

351
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,079
that makes you win in a war

352
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,920
is discretion.

353
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:22,720
Pawinee's rats might eavesdrop
on us if we talk at home.

354
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,680
Or if we talked in the car,

355
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,160
Pawinee might bug it.

356
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,720
Oh, I see.

357
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,160
This is the safest place

358
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,480
to question you.

359
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,200
Hey, you thief!

360
00:22:37,839 --> 00:22:39,880
- Are you okay?
- I just bought that phone.

361
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:41,359
- I'll get it back.
- They stole it.

362
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,279
- Mister, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

363
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:03,440
These men are thieves.

364
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,480
How much money should I ask
as a reward from Ms. Nade?

365
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:13,680
What? Mister.

366
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,640
It's her phone. Let go of me.

367
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,279
Are you okay?

368
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,319
I'm sorry about that.

369
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,279
I got it back.

370
00:23:36,079 --> 00:23:37,240
Should I call the police?

371
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,799
No, let them go.

372
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,440
Thank you.

373
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:45,720
I didn't know

374
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,960
you were this much of a man.

375
00:23:48,519 --> 00:23:49,720
I did everything I could

376
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,079
to get your phone back.

377
00:24:02,759 --> 00:24:04,000
What?

378
00:24:05,759 --> 00:24:08,039
Don't tell me you want a reward
for getting my phone back.

379
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,160
Fine.

380
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,960
I'll tell Auntie Erb
that her super cool nephew

381
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:17,200
helped her boss's daughter
only to get something in return.

382
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,519
I was actually asking for your hand

383
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,400
so I could walk you back to the car.

384
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,240
- Really?
- Yes.

385
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,880
Trai's in love with you?

386
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,079
Shush.

387
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,440
Mom might hear you.

388
00:24:47,519 --> 00:24:48,720
No, she won't.

389
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:50,720
She went up to her room hours ago.

390
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,359
Are you sure
it's not all in your head?

391
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:59,000
I'm not a self-loving bighead.

392
00:24:59,079 --> 00:25:03,000
Gosh, that's not what I'm saying.

393
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:05,279
But what makes you certain

394
00:25:05,359 --> 00:25:07,039
that he's in love with you?

395
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:09,839
Did Trai confess his feelings?

396
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,400
It was so obvious
that he didn't need to say a word.

397
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:17,759
Trai wouldn't have risked
his life for a phone

398
00:25:17,839 --> 00:25:19,759
unless

399
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,440
the phone

400
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,960
belonged to his secret lover.

401
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:28,000
No wonder Trai refused
to go back to work.

402
00:25:28,079 --> 00:25:32,519
He wants to stay here with you.

403
00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:34,720
Are you going to accept his love?

404
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,960
- Ew.
- Ew.

405
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,000
I should tell Trai to get over you.

406
00:25:40,079 --> 00:25:41,359
No, don't do that.

407
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,839
Let Trai fall head over heels

408
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
for me.

409
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,720
I'm going to use my charm

410
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:54,039
to get Trai to spy on Pa and Nai.

411
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:56,680
My mother will be proud of me

412
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:59,440
when I show her proof

413
00:25:59,799 --> 00:26:02,039
that Nai and Pa are not in love.

414
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,039
There you are.

415
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,559
It's an old trick.

416
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,319
What are you talking about?

417
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,440
You want to hit the jackpot,
don't you?

418
00:26:17,799 --> 00:26:19,039
He's so annoying.

419
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,359
What was that?

420
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,440
Grab it.

421
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:34,680
Madame wants you to visit
Mr. Singkorn with her.

422
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,960
Nai, you are here.

423
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:45,559
Come with me to Singkorn's house.

424
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,000
For what?

425
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,920
Singkorn invited us over for dinner.

426
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,759
Are you sure

427
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,599
there's no hidden agenda,

428
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,400
such as finding me a new job?

429
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:59,680
Gosh, Nai. You think too much.

430
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:01,279
Let's go.

431
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:02,839
Come on.

432
00:27:09,559 --> 00:27:10,640
Wait.

433
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:16,720
Let me come with you.

434
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,119
What's your pro...

435
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:19,839
Excuse me.

436
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,160
You can go, Phol.

437
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:46,839
Hello.

438
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,240
Hello.

439
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,279
Hello.

440
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:04,920
Pa.

441
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,119
This is Singkorn, and this is Lita.

442
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:12,200
Hello.

443
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:18,160
This is Pawinee, Da's sister.

444
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:22,799
Da often talked about you, Lita.

445
00:28:23,599 --> 00:28:25,440
We finally get to meet.

446
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:38,720
Toey, can you hand me a plate?

447
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,839
Pa, what are you doing?

448
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,960
Well, you asked for a plate.

449
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,119
Oh no.

450
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:00,960
I'm sorry.

451
00:29:01,359 --> 00:29:03,759
I mistook the knife for a plate.

452
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:07,720
You would have gotten cut
if you had grabbed it from me.

453
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,039
Some people mistake evil

454
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:13,079
for good

455
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:16,160
by trying to get involved
with other people's husbands

456
00:29:16,519 --> 00:29:18,599
and causing pain to their family.

457
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:21,559
Do you hate me because of Da?

458
00:29:22,119 --> 00:29:26,160
I never intended
to steal Nai from her.

459
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,240
Is that so?

460
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,119
Are you aware that
people who do one thing

461
00:29:30,599 --> 00:29:34,640
but say another are called liars?

462
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,200
You are

463
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:38,599
one beautiful woman.

464
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:42,599
You shouldn't have trouble
looking for a single man.

465
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,759
Why would you want to date Nai

466
00:29:45,839 --> 00:29:48,519
when he's married with a kid?

467
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:50,119
Madame Nuan's the one

468
00:29:50,599 --> 00:29:52,839
who wants to set us up.

469
00:29:53,319 --> 00:29:56,559
It takes two to tango.

470
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,960
We wouldn't be in this situation
if you made it clear

471
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:03,319
that you didn't want to be
a mistress despite how much

472
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,079
Madame Nuan adored you.

473
00:30:06,599 --> 00:30:09,119
But here you are
disrespecting my sister

474
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,759
by shamelessly seeking attention
from Madame Nuan.

475
00:30:13,319 --> 00:30:14,359
It's as clear as day

476
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,599
that your lustful mind

477
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:19,279
still yearns for Nai.

478
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,799
- You are going too far.
- Do you still want Nai?

479
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:23,799
Why do you ask?

480
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,759
If you are giving up

481
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,799
on seducing Nai,

482
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,960
I beg you,

483
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,119
don't give up just yet.

484
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,759
Bring back the will to steal Nai
from his wife and steal him from me.

485
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,960
It's only fun
when a desperate woman like you

486
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:42,079
goes up against

487
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,559
someone like me.

488
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:49,119
Good luck.

489
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:02,160
Let's drink to welcome Pawinee,
Nai's beautiful wife.

490
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,279
Thank you.

491
00:31:12,319 --> 00:31:13,640
Let's dig in.

492
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,119
Are you going
to have a baby right away?

493
00:31:24,079 --> 00:31:26,920
I'll need to ask
the future grandma first.

494
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,319
Now isn't a good time.

495
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:35,039
Many people these days
are not in their right mind.

496
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,119
It's a tough world.

497
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,799
Yes, I agree.

498
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,759
I'm not ready to be a mother either,
as I still wish to work.

499
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,319
If you have a baby

500
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,480
but don't have enough time

501
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:54,319
to love and care for them,

502
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,319
the baby will grow up
to be an unloved adult

503
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,720
who seeks love and attention
from people on social media.

504
00:32:02,759 --> 00:32:04,640
Are you talking about me?

505
00:32:07,319 --> 00:32:10,279
I haven't mentioned you at all.

506
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:12,000
Why are you...

507
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:32,519
Enjoy.

508
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:38,240
I hear you are
launching a new product.

509
00:32:38,319 --> 00:32:39,960
That's right.

510
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:41,119
Go get it for me.

511
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,160
Here it is.

512
00:32:50,759 --> 00:32:52,240
Drinks called "Health Plus".

513
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,759
We just got the approval
from the FDA.

514
00:32:55,319 --> 00:32:57,920
We are looking for a company
to help promote it.

515
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,920
I'd like the slogan

516
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,640
to be "strong women".
It speaks to me.

517
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,720
What a nice opportunity. Nai just
quit his job at the oil platform.

518
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:09,240
He's founding an advertising
company with a friend.

519
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:11,400
Give this project a shot, Nai.

520
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,799
All right then.

521
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:17,000
I'll call your company tomorrow
for more details.

522
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,480
You don't need to call his company.

523
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,799
Just talk to Singkorn directly.

524
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,920
- Please treat him nicely.
- Of course.

525
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,000
You have nothing to worry about.

526
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,880
We're not strangers.

527
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Mom.

528
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,400
Didn't I tell you

529
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,119
that I didn't need your help?

530
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,279
You are new in this field.

531
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,799
Let me help you.

532
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,079
No.

533
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:03,400
I want to get hired
because of my skills.

534
00:34:03,759 --> 00:34:06,359
Not because of your connections.

535
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:08,360
But I will be humiliated

536
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,639
if you can't find a job.

537
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:12,920
But if I manage to find one,

538
00:34:13,559 --> 00:34:15,289
you will be very proud of me.

539
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,440
Believe in me.

540
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,840
I'm not going to embarrass you.

541
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:27,559
Fine.

542
00:34:28,559 --> 00:34:29,809
I believe in you.

543
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,000
I still don't see

544
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:49,119
how your plan is going to reveal
Madame Nuan's true personality.

545
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,920
Joy, picture this.

546
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,519
Who is going to lose face
when Nai isn't hired by the company

547
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,960
Madame Nuan works at?

548
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,329
Madame Nuan.

549
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,639
Exactly.

550
00:35:00,239 --> 00:35:01,679
Once Nai screws up,

551
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:04,079
Madame Nuan won't let him
screw up again.

552
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,329
She's going to use her connections

553
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,400
and do whatever it takes

554
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:10,360
to get Nai a job.

555
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,329
She's going to step in

556
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:13,920
despite what Nai told her.

557
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,519
Then Nai's going to realize

558
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:19,719
how competitive
his mother really is.

559
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,400
That's right.

560
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:24,719
Therefore, the first thing I must do

561
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,559
is make sure
Nai ends up as a failure.

562
00:35:29,039 --> 00:35:30,239
I get it now.

563
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,809
Hey, Pa.

564
00:35:42,199 --> 00:35:44,679
- Mon, someone delivered these.
- Thank you.

565
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,880
- Listen, Thom.
- What?

566
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,000
Singkorn's company
is launching a new product.

567
00:35:50,840 --> 00:35:53,519
He's looking for a company
to promote the product

568
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,920
and host a launch event for him.

569
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:01,079
When it comes
to Singkorn's products,

570
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:03,440
we can't beat
Madame Nuan's connections.

571
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,599
With a good plan,

572
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,519
we can.

573
00:36:09,769 --> 00:36:12,199
Joy and I did some research.

574
00:36:13,199 --> 00:36:16,679
There are five members
on the committee

575
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:20,119
that decide which
advertising company gets the job.

576
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:23,679
The decision is based on
the majority of the votes.

577
00:36:23,769 --> 00:36:27,400
We need three
out of five members to pick us.

578
00:36:28,559 --> 00:36:30,440
Who are those five members?

579
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,400
The first member is Mr. Singkorn.

580
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,559
His relationship with Madame Nuan

581
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:40,840
is so tight that he wishes
their two families to become one.

582
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:43,400
Even though Nai's married,

583
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,440
his intention remains unchanged.

584
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:48,039
Therefore,

585
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:51,079
it's pretty much impossible
to get his vote.

586
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,199
The second member

587
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,239
is also hard to win over.

588
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,440
Madame Nuan
once helped him pay his debt.

589
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,199
He owes her a favor.

590
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:12,199
Thank you, Madame.

591
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:18,000
I will never forget your kindness.

592
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,599
It's impossible to get his vote too.

593
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,039
Mrs. Chat.

594
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:28,960
My friend, Pop,
works as her secretary.

595
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:31,079
She knows everything about Mrs.
Chat.

596
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,079
Mrs. Chat's weakness
is her love for her cheating husband

597
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:37,809
who has a new mistress every month.

598
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,360
Mrs. Chat,
it's time for your meeting.

599
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,000
She believes it's only natural

600
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:44,519
for men

601
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:46,480
to cheat on their lovers.

602
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,480
The ones to blame are the women

603
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:50,679
who can be bought with money.

604
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:54,079
Therefore, to win Mrs. Chat over,

605
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:57,440
we should focus on encouraging women

606
00:37:57,519 --> 00:37:59,079
to value themselves.

607
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:01,360
The fourth and the fifth member

608
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,159
are Mr. Joe and Mr. Warin.

609
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:06,000
These two men are upright.

610
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:07,920
They don't side with anyone.

611
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:09,960
As long as we do a good job,

612
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,400
they will be ready to support us.

613
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:15,329
Okay.

614
00:38:15,769 --> 00:38:17,199
Let's do this.

615
00:39:01,159 --> 00:39:02,679
Where's Nick?

616
00:39:02,769 --> 00:39:04,119
He's sleeping with Dao.

617
00:39:05,289 --> 00:39:07,079
Why are you home late these days?

618
00:39:07,639 --> 00:39:08,769
I have a lot of work.

619
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:10,480
Pa.

620
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:13,519
I still don't know
what you do for a living.

621
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,719
You'll find out soon enough.

622
00:39:15,809 --> 00:39:17,809
How's your new job going?

623
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,079
Is your presentation tomorrow?

624
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:22,559
Yes, I'm practicing my presentation.

625
00:39:23,719 --> 00:39:25,480
I haven't done a presentation

626
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:27,159
ever since I graduated.

627
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:28,920
But it's fun.

628
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,719
My life needs some excitement.

629
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:34,119
I have a feeling
there is a lot of excitement

630
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:36,960
waiting for you tomorrow.

631
00:39:55,719 --> 00:39:57,039
Pa.

632
00:39:57,329 --> 00:39:58,809
I brought you a sandwich.

633
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:05,039
Da told me

634
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,719
you usually forget to eat
whenever you put your mind

635
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:09,400
to something

636
00:40:10,239 --> 00:40:11,639
and complain about it later.

637
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,159
Here.

638
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,400
Eat this.

639
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,519
I don't want to hear you complain.

640
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,039
You are aware

641
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:20,639
that treating me nicely

642
00:40:21,199 --> 00:40:22,599
won't make up

643
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:26,289
for what your mother
and sister did to us,

644
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,719
aren't you?

645
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:28,960
I know.

646
00:40:29,719 --> 00:40:30,920
I'm doing this

647
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:33,000
because you are Da's sister.

648
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,400
Finish the sandwich.

649
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,360
If you don't,

650
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,519
I'll tell your father
that you wasted food.

651
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:53,440
Wait.

652
00:40:55,809 --> 00:40:56,960
Thank you.

653
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,000
- Yes!
- That's perfect.

654
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,079
Good.

655
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,880
- Did you get a good one?
- Yes.

656
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:41,960
Thank you.

657
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Here you go.

658
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,639
Thank you.

659
00:41:53,039 --> 00:41:54,289
That was refreshing.

660
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,119
- Da took our father to the toilet.
- I see.

661
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,679
May I call you by your name?

662
00:42:03,239 --> 00:42:04,440
Of course.

663
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,079
Nai.

664
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,440
Please don't mind my father.

665
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,159
Da has never had a boyfriend before,

666
00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:13,920
so my father's having
a hard time accepting it.

667
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:18,920
What do I have to do
to get your father's approval?

668
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,480
Well.

669
00:42:21,719 --> 00:42:25,559
On your end, you just need to love
and be sincere with Da.

670
00:42:25,639 --> 00:42:28,239
Everything else
will get better with time.

671
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,329
My father and I love Da very much.

672
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,000
Why wouldn't we want a good man

673
00:42:35,079 --> 00:42:37,679
to stand by her side?

674
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:40,159
I'm going to

675
00:42:40,329 --> 00:42:44,679
talk you up to my father
three times a day.

676
00:42:44,769 --> 00:42:47,239
Eventually, he will give in.

677
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:49,199
It feels much better

678
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:50,769
to have your support.

679
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:53,679
Hey, why don't we
take a photo together?

680
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,360
Sure.

681
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,440
Please take a photo for us.

682
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,039
All right.

683
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:03,119
Let's work together to get
my father's approval for Da's sake.

684
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:05,119
Can we do this?

685
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,639
- We can!
- Yes!

686
00:43:06,809 --> 00:43:09,769
Here we go, one, two, three.

687
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:11,159
- We can do this!
- We can do this!

688
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,329
I know you are not a bad person.

689
00:43:16,809 --> 00:43:18,289
You are just upset.

690
00:43:19,239 --> 00:43:21,289
One day, you will go back

691
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,000
to being the same old Pa.

692
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,599
How's my boy doing?

693
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,320
Where's Pa?

694
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:47,719
She left early in the morning.

695
00:43:53,679 --> 00:43:57,039
Sasi, please take care
of my son, Nai.

696
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,679
You got it, Madame.

697
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:03,119
I got this job as Mr. Singkorn's
secretary, thanks to you.

698
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,039
Taking care of Mr. Nai

699
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:07,239
is the least I can do.

700
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,920
Are there many competitors?

701
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,639
There is one.

702
00:44:10,719 --> 00:44:13,280
But they are
a small advertising company.

703
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:17,920
Please kindly keep me updated.

704
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:21,119
I will, Madame. Goodbye.

705
00:44:24,519 --> 00:44:26,840
- Hello, Mr. Kee.
- Hello.

706
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,280
- Hello, Mr. Noppanai.
- Hello.

707
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:30,880
Hello.

708
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,559
Please follow me upstairs.

709
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:34,559
- The committee is ready for you.
- All right.

710
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,480
Excuse me, everybody.

711
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:41,440
The first company has arrived.

712
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:43,599
- Hello.
- Hello.

713
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:47,519
You may start your presentation.

714
00:44:47,679 --> 00:44:48,920
Okay, thank you.

715
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:51,639
- Set it up please. Let's do this.
- Yes.

716
00:45:04,679 --> 00:45:05,679
Hello.

717
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:08,800
I'm Noppanai from NJ Company.

718
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,360
Everyone.

719
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,480
This is Noppanai,

720
00:45:12,679 --> 00:45:14,199
Madame Nuan's son.

721
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:20,960
I'm sorry.

722
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,679
I'd prefer to be remembered
as a representative from NJ Company.

723
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,519
Thank you for the update, Sasi.

724
00:45:38,679 --> 00:45:40,440
How did Nai do, Mom?

725
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,599
Sasi said Nai did a great job.

726
00:45:44,159 --> 00:45:47,519
No wonder he's my son.

727
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,559
I will call you
once we have the result.

728
00:45:53,639 --> 00:45:56,440
Then we will set up a date
to sign the contract.

729
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:57,840
I see. Okay.

730
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:00,760
I have to take this call.

731
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:02,519
The next team is probably here.

732
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:05,320
I see. We should get going then.

733
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,239
- Okay, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

734
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:09,760
Let's go.

735
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:26,199
Pa?

736
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:30,400
I still don't know
what you do for a living.

737
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:32,599
You'll find out soon enough.

738
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:36,480
Nai.

739
00:46:37,159 --> 00:46:40,079
This is my boss, Thom.

740
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:42,960
Did you say boss?

741
00:46:43,559 --> 00:46:45,880
Does this mean it's a competition

742
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:49,400
between husband and wife?

743
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,199
You have nothing to worry about.

744
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,679
We might be married,

745
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:58,320
but we can put that aside
when it comes to work, right, Nai?

746
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:02,880
Hello, I'm Thomtawee.

747
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,960
Hello, I'm Kee.

748
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,719
Hello, Noppanai.

749
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:09,800
Hello.

750
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,239
It's nice to meet you.

751
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,400
Likewise. We finally meet.

752
00:47:17,159 --> 00:47:19,119
Da used to talk about you a lot.

753
00:47:19,679 --> 00:47:22,079
I wonder what she said about me.

754
00:47:22,159 --> 00:47:24,280
Mostly, it was about Pa.

755
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:27,559
Da said you were Pa's hero.
Always looking out for her

756
00:47:28,519 --> 00:47:30,360
as she would often do something

757
00:47:31,639 --> 00:47:33,280
unexpected.

758
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,719
We should go.

759
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:41,639
- Yes, please excuse us.
- Yes.

760
00:48:01,639 --> 00:48:05,079
Please follow me inside.

761
00:48:05,159 --> 00:48:06,679
The committee is waiting.

762
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:07,800
This way.

763
00:48:14,599 --> 00:48:16,000
Pa.

764
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:18,800
Are you okay?

765
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,320
Let's just go.
A big project awaits us.

766
00:48:32,480 --> 00:48:33,679
What did you say?

767
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,920
Pawinee is there?

768
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:42,159
Yes, Ms. Pawinee is here
as Mr. Thomtawee's consultant.

769
00:48:44,199 --> 00:48:46,000
Is something wrong, Madame?

770
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,119
Pawinee is competing
against Nai for the project.

771
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:53,159
Against her own husband?

772
00:48:56,119 --> 00:48:57,920
She's not going against him.

773
00:48:58,239 --> 00:49:00,119
She's going against me.

774
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:07,719
The word "strong" represents
strength in English.

775
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,239
But for Thai people,
the word "strong"

776
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:15,559
has a deep and positive meaning.

777
00:49:15,639 --> 00:49:18,519
When we use the word "strong"
to describe women,

778
00:49:19,239 --> 00:49:23,679
we are talking about both
their physical and mental strength.

779
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,239
Having physical and mental strength

780
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:29,639
is not enough to be considered
a strong woman.

781
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,719
Strong women

782
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,159
should also know
what to do and what not to do.

783
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:37,320
Confidence is key.

784
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:39,000
Be yourself.

785
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,159
Be bold to take action.

786
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:44,039
You don't need
to be brave all the time.

787
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:45,960
Being weak is acceptable at times

788
00:49:46,039 --> 00:49:49,119
if it gives you
a greater result in return.

789
00:49:49,679 --> 00:49:51,559
That sounds like a sly woman to me.

790
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:54,360
Sly women

791
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:56,760
misuse their talents
to do bad deeds.

792
00:49:56,840 --> 00:49:59,920
But women who use their talents
to do good deeds

793
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:01,639
are called smart.

794
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,119
We will create an advertisement

795
00:50:05,559 --> 00:50:09,280
and billboard signs with the slogan

796
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,480
"Stay strong every day
with Health Plus".

797
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,840
We will interview

798
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:17,760
socially accepted
and successful women

799
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,519
and post it on social media.

800
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,920
We will present
their perspectives and lifestyles

801
00:50:23,039 --> 00:50:25,320
to encourage our customers

802
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,559
to desire
their good quality of life.

803
00:50:28,679 --> 00:50:32,480
After that,
we will tie the product in

804
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:34,840
to send a message to the customers

805
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:38,920
that strong women
should love themselves

806
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:43,840
and that they can do that
by drinking Health Plus,

807
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:47,320
a healthy drink, every day.

808
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,519
(HEALTH PLUS, The choice
for smart and strong women.)

809
00:51:03,719 --> 00:51:06,039
Have you decided who to vote for?

810
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:14,599
Okay, thank you so much
for the information, Pop.

811
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:16,400
I'll talk to you later.

812
00:51:20,679 --> 00:51:22,360
Hey, Joy. When did you arrive?

813
00:51:22,519 --> 00:51:24,199
Not long ago.

814
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,119
I was just on the phone with Pop.

815
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:29,360
Oh, Pop?

816
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,960
Isn't she Mrs. Chat's secretary?

817
00:51:31,039 --> 00:51:32,519
Yes.

818
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:35,800
Pop called with some information.

819
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,599
What did she say?

820
00:51:40,679 --> 00:51:41,760
She said...

821
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,039
Mrs. Chat voted for us.

822
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:48,119
- Yes!
- Yes!

823
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:57,079
Who's calling you, Pa?

824
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,039
(Madame Nuan)

825
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,559
I'm going to answer it.

826
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,679
I'll be right back.

827
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:15,920
- Joy.
- Yes.

828
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:20,079
Don't you think
that Pa, Nai, and Nai's family

829
00:52:20,159 --> 00:52:21,320
don't act the way

830
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:23,880
typical families do?

831
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,320
It seems to me like

832
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,800
Pa was forced to marry him.

833
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:30,960
Come on, Thom.

834
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:32,480
You know

835
00:52:32,599 --> 00:52:35,199
that no one can force Pa
to do anything.

836
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:37,840
You are right.

837
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:42,280
Oh my. You are sacrificing
your precious time to call me.

838
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,000
It must be my lucky day.

839
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:47,880
I thought your sister was stupid,

840
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,320
but you are even more
of an idiot than her.

841
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,440
Who do you think you are

842
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,119
to challenge me?

843
00:52:57,199 --> 00:53:01,559
And who do you think you are?
Why would anyone challenge you?

844
00:53:02,119 --> 00:53:04,079
You should be proud

845
00:53:04,159 --> 00:53:07,159
that your daughter-in-law is working
hard to make a living,

846
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:11,639
unlike your daughter who is waiting
for a sugar daddy to support her.

847
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:22,360
How can I be proud of you

848
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:25,920
when you are about to humiliate me?

849
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,280
What makes you so certain
that I'm going to lose?

850
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:31,639
Even a baby can tell.

851
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:35,599
Don't be so sure.
Anything can happen.

852
00:53:36,159 --> 00:53:37,719
If you lose to me,

853
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,719
you will be humiliated
like you've never been before.

854
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,239
Why don't we place a bet?

855
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,960
If I win,

856
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,960
I get to order you to do one thing.

857
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:49,199
And what if you lose?

858
00:53:49,679 --> 00:53:51,079
You get three wishes.

859
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:52,960
It's a deal.

860
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,840
I did a thorough background check
on the committee members.

861
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:03,760
Besides Mr. Kongsak
and Mr. Singkorn,

862
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,519
there's another member
that might be of great help to us.

863
00:54:07,599 --> 00:54:09,239
And this person is...

864
00:54:16,639 --> 00:54:17,760
Mrs. Chat.

865
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:22,519
She has a weakness right here.

866
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,000
Her boobs?

867
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,639
She got a boob job,
and it got infected?

868
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:28,280
Not her boobs.

869
00:54:28,599 --> 00:54:29,599
Her heart.

870
00:54:29,679 --> 00:54:34,639
She loves her husband
with all of her heart.

871
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:40,559
Let's vote to decide

872
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:44,239
which company is going
to promote our new product.

873
00:54:44,320 --> 00:54:46,559
I vote for Madame Nuan's son.

874
00:54:46,639 --> 00:54:47,960
I vote for Pawinee.

875
00:54:48,039 --> 00:54:49,360
I vote for Pawinee.

876
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:52,280
Ms. Pawinee is in the lead.

877
00:54:57,639 --> 00:55:01,800
I hear your husband
wants to be involved in politics.

878
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,559
How does he feel
about being a minister?

879
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,880
I'll give him my full support.

880
00:55:11,039 --> 00:55:13,320
Which company are you
voting for, Mrs. Chat?

881
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,719
Mrs. Chat changed her mind
and voted for Nai's company.

882
00:55:27,719 --> 00:55:30,360
I thought your friend said
she was going to vote for us.

883
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,039
I'm guessing Madame Nuan
gave Mrs. Chat an undeniable offer

884
00:55:34,119 --> 00:55:35,960
and that changed her mind.

885
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:37,800
I knew it.

886
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:40,760
How can we go up against someone
who plays dirty like that?

887
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:44,679
This means it's tied

888
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:47,440
- at 2-2 right now.
- Yes.

889
00:55:47,519 --> 00:55:50,679
Therefore, the outcome depends

890
00:55:50,760 --> 00:55:52,760
on Mr. Singkorn's vote.

891
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:55,920
Mr. Singkorn is going to
undoubtedly side with Madame Nuan.

892
00:55:57,039 --> 00:55:58,519
You don't know that.

893
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,480
What do you mean?

894
00:56:11,119 --> 00:56:16,800
I'd love to hear your feedback
on the presentation today.

895
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,880
Can we talk about it over a meal?

896
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,880
It's a tie right now.

897
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,880
Mr. Singkorn will be
making the last vote.

898
00:56:30,599 --> 00:56:32,320
He doesn't even need to vote.

899
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:35,679
Everyone knows
that he doesn't trust anyone

900
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,320
but Madame Nuan.

901
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:41,320
Who do you vote for, Mr. Singkorn?

902
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,320
We won!

903
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:12,880
Yes!

904
00:57:17,280 --> 00:57:19,840
How is this possible?
How did we lose?

905
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,239
Did Chat not believe

906
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:26,360
that my mother had enough power
to help her husband?

907
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:28,960
Was there a mistake
with the counting?

908
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:31,400
Even the government makes mistakes
when they announce the lottery.

909
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,360
The balls are in
this lucky draw box,

910
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,840
and sometimes the balls pop open

911
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,079
- then...
- Shut up!

912
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:39,280
Enough with the nonsense.

913
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,840
Tom, get the car ready.

914
00:57:42,679 --> 00:57:43,920
Yes, Madame.

915
00:57:58,519 --> 00:58:00,360
I want to know what happened.

916
00:58:03,519 --> 00:58:04,800
Hello, Madame.

917
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:09,639
Calm down, Madame.

918
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:14,000
I knew you were coming so I prepared
a bottle of French wine for you.

919
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,920
I don't want it.
I don't drink with traitors.

920
00:58:21,559 --> 00:58:24,119
I didn't pick your son's company
to work on this project

921
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:26,800
because I have something better,

922
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:28,119
bigger,

923
00:58:28,239 --> 00:58:30,320
and more international
for him to work on.

924
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:48,920
Hey, you.

925
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:50,280
Hey.

926
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,599
Where are you taking Nick?

927
00:58:53,679 --> 00:58:56,159
Mr. Nai ordered us to take Nick
to the other house for a bit.

928
00:58:56,719 --> 00:58:58,880
Apparently, he has a serious matter
to talk to you about.

929
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,480
Dao said you want to talk to me.

930
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:25,320
Are you going to congratulate me?

931
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:29,920
I want a divorce.

932
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:34,760
Give me a reason.

933
00:59:37,199 --> 00:59:39,639
You are more dangerous
than I thought you were.

934
00:59:41,159 --> 00:59:45,239
Up until now, I was patient with you
and always let you have your way

935
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:48,840
because I still saw you
as Da's innocent sister.

936
00:59:49,519 --> 00:59:50,519
But now I know

937
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:52,320
that I was wrong.

938
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,639
You are vengeful

939
00:59:55,719 --> 00:59:57,000
and unreasonable.

940
00:59:57,559 --> 00:59:59,559
You would do anything
to get what you want.

941
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:02,800
It's not my family
who Nick should stay away from.

942
01:00:03,480 --> 01:00:04,679
It's you.

943
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:10,679
We are going to the district office
at 10 a.m. tomorrow.

944
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:13,239
No.

945
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,119
I'm not divorcing you.

946
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:18,639
Don't make me do something
I really don't want to do.

947
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:22,079
Why? What are you going to do to me?

948
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,599
Take advantage of me?

949
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,199
We are not in biblical times.

950
01:00:26,159 --> 01:00:28,840
Don't worry. I'm not going
to take advantage of you.

951
01:00:28,920 --> 01:00:30,559
I only sleep with women I love.

952
01:00:30,639 --> 01:00:33,239
But I'm going to tell your father
why you are afraid to drive.

953
01:00:38,519 --> 01:00:40,920
You killed a person with a car.

954
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:43,079
You were still in high school

955
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:45,079
and didn't even have
a driver's license.

956
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:50,760
What? Dad's on his way home?

957
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:52,440
Wait.

958
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:55,519
Isn't he supposed to come back
tomorrow? Why the sudden change, Da?

959
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:57,320
A student had an allergic reaction,

960
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:00,320
so Dad took him to the hospital.

961
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,039
His parents just arrived,

962
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:03,719
and it's getting late too,

963
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:05,480
so Dad decided to come home.

964
01:01:05,639 --> 01:01:07,039
Where are you?

965
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,079
I'm almost home.

966
01:01:09,159 --> 01:01:10,440
Hurry home.

967
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:12,679
If Dad comes back and finds out

968
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,320
that I let you take his car
to a birthday party,

969
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,000
he's going to be furious.

970
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:18,599
Yes, I know.

971
01:01:18,679 --> 01:01:20,440
I'll step on it. I have to go.

972
01:02:09,159 --> 01:02:10,199
Pa.

973
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:11,360
Pa.

974
01:02:14,119 --> 01:02:16,519
- What's wrong?
- Thom.

975
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:18,679
I...

976
01:02:19,199 --> 01:02:21,559
I hit a person, Thom.

977
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:25,920
He came from out of nowhere.
I didn't see him, Thom.

978
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,199
How is he doing?

979
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,440
I don't know.

980
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:31,159
I was too scared to check on him.

981
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:35,519
Thom, can you go with me
to check on him?

982
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:36,920
Okay.

983
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,159
Thom.

984
01:02:38,239 --> 01:02:40,800
Can you drive? I'm scared.

985
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:42,079
Of course.

986
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,400
There's no one here, Pa.

987
01:02:51,880 --> 01:02:53,880
How can that be, Thom?

988
01:02:54,239 --> 01:02:56,400
He was lying on the ground just now.

989
01:02:56,960 --> 01:02:57,960
How about we go down together?

990
01:03:00,039 --> 01:03:01,039
Okay.

991
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:23,159
Where did he go, Thom?

992
01:03:23,639 --> 01:03:25,760
He was lying right there.

993
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:42,119
How do you know about that?

994
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:44,519
Da told me.

995
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:45,800
No way.

996
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:47,639
Da didn't know about that.

997
01:03:47,719 --> 01:03:50,400
She did.
She knew about it all along.

998
01:03:55,239 --> 01:03:57,519
She was supposed to arrive
a long time ago.

999
01:04:05,199 --> 01:04:06,360
Pa.

1000
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,519
Are you sure
about not going to the police?

1001
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,480
Yes.

1002
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,760
I don't want to get Dad in trouble.

1003
01:04:19,840 --> 01:04:21,039
There's a chance

1004
01:04:21,519 --> 01:04:22,960
the old man

1005
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,320
is safe.

1006
01:04:25,400 --> 01:04:27,800
Yes, I think he is.

1007
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:30,559
Look at the car.
There's not a scratch on it.

1008
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,840
What if he's dead, Thom?

1009
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,920
His wife and kids

1010
01:04:37,159 --> 01:04:39,440
are probably waiting
for him at home, Thom.

1011
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,679
What if he's the head of the family

1012
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,880
and got injured or became disabled?

1013
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:48,079
Who's going to support
his family, Thom?

1014
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:50,440
How is his family going to live
without him?

1015
01:04:50,440 --> 01:04:52,440
- I killed him.
- Pa.

1016
01:04:52,519 --> 01:04:53,800
It's okay.

1017
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,039
Calm down.

1018
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:56,519
Pa.

1019
01:04:56,599 --> 01:04:58,440
Pa, listen to me.

1020
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:00,360
He is safe.

1021
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:01,800
Stop crying.

1022
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:03,440
All right, Pa?

1023
01:05:03,519 --> 01:05:07,480
If we find out who he is,
I'm going to take you to see him.

1024
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:11,440
Consider this a lesson, Pa.

1025
01:05:11,639 --> 01:05:13,559
Okay? Don't drive carelessly again.

1026
01:05:13,639 --> 01:05:15,760
I've learned my lesson, Thom.

1027
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:18,199
Are you going to tell Da

1028
01:05:18,840 --> 01:05:19,960
what happened?

1029
01:05:24,039 --> 01:05:25,039
No.

1030
01:05:26,119 --> 01:05:27,199
I...

1031
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,719
I don't want Da to know.

1032
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:35,440
I don't want my mistake
to cause her pain.

1033
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:41,760
I'm sorry.

1034
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:44,639
I didn't mean to.

1035
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,840
I'm sorry.

1036
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:10,360
She knew how devastated you were,

1037
01:06:11,519 --> 01:06:13,280
so she pretended to be clueless.

1038
01:06:13,960 --> 01:06:15,960
She thought
it would help you get over it.

1039
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,599
Da would be furious at you

1040
01:06:19,159 --> 01:06:21,119
if she knew

1041
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:23,880
you were using the accident
to blackmail me.

1042
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,159
Da would understand

1043
01:06:26,239 --> 01:06:28,480
that I wouldn't use it against you
if I wasn't desperate.

1044
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:32,079
So what will it be?

1045
01:06:32,840 --> 01:06:34,519
Are you going to divorce me?

1046
01:06:35,719 --> 01:06:37,599
Or do I tell your father
what happened?

1047
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:47,280
So what will it be?

1048
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:49,760
Are you going to divorce me?

1049
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,840
Or do I tell your father
what happened?

1050
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,440
You left me no choice.

1051
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,119
Nai, where are you going?

1052
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:05,280
Fine.

1053
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,079
Let's get a divorce.

1054
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,239
I'll meet you
at the district office.

1055
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,159
I'm busy tomorrow morning.

1056
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,400
You can't fool me anymore.

1057
01:07:17,840 --> 01:07:19,000
Nai.

1058
01:07:19,519 --> 01:07:21,119
Nai, talk to me.

1059
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,320
Nai.

1060
01:07:25,119 --> 01:07:26,440
Nai.

1061
01:07:26,519 --> 01:07:27,559
Where are you going?

1062
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,679
Nai, wait!

1063
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:37,840
Nai, talk to me first.

1064
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:39,639
Are you going to my father's house?

1065
01:07:40,599 --> 01:07:43,039
Nai, you cannot tell
my father about this.

1066
01:07:44,599 --> 01:07:46,880
Nai, get out of the car
and talk to me. I'm begging you.

1067
01:07:48,039 --> 01:07:49,239
Nai!

1068
01:07:57,639 --> 01:07:58,920
Nai!

1069
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,960
You either get out of the car
or run me over.

1070
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,880
Get out, Nai.

1071
01:08:05,960 --> 01:08:07,119
Get out of the car!

1072
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,279
Nai! No!

1073
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:23,199
- Go, Mr. Nai.
- Nai, hear me out.

1074
01:08:23,529 --> 01:08:25,279
I'm begging you. Come back.

1075
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:27,880
I'm sorry, Pa. I don't know
what you guys are fighting about,

1076
01:08:27,960 --> 01:08:31,239
but he doesn't want you to
follow him, so I can't let you go.

1077
01:08:31,319 --> 01:08:32,960
- Let go!
- No.

1078
01:08:33,569 --> 01:08:34,880
Nai!

1079
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:43,920
Nai!

1080
01:08:57,649 --> 01:08:59,399
- To Phutthamonthon District.
- Okay.

1081
01:09:00,039 --> 01:09:03,680
You either get out of the car
or run me over.

1082
01:09:05,039 --> 01:09:08,119
They must be fighting
about the advertising gig.

1083
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:11,119
Good. I hope they break up.

1084
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:15,529
Ms. Nade, Tang has
even juicier news to tell you.

1085
01:09:15,609 --> 01:09:17,439
- Really? What is it?
- Well, Pa...

1086
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:19,039
Pit.

1087
01:09:19,119 --> 01:09:20,239
Tang saw it.

1088
01:09:20,569 --> 01:09:21,760
Let her tell the story.

1089
01:09:25,079 --> 01:09:28,039
Before I grabbed my phone
to record what happened,

1090
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:31,529
I overheard Ms. Pa saying...

1091
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,720
Are you going to my father's house?

1092
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,199
Nai, you cannot tell
my father about this.

1093
01:09:37,569 --> 01:09:38,720
Tell her father about what?

1094
01:09:39,649 --> 01:09:41,840
What is this big secret?

1095
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:53,439
How can you do this to me?

1096
01:09:53,529 --> 01:09:54,880
You have to be mine.

1097
01:09:56,529 --> 01:09:57,880
Trai is filming us.

1098
01:09:58,609 --> 01:10:00,279
Do you have a secret family?

1099
01:10:00,359 --> 01:10:01,609
I wouldn't keep them a secret.

1100
01:10:01,680 --> 01:10:07,399
Madame, I have unpleasant news about
your daughter-in-law to tell you.

1101
01:10:07,479 --> 01:10:10,159
An eye for an eye.

1102
01:10:11,439 --> 01:10:12,920
You are going to end up

1103
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,800
like your sister.

1104
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:17,279
I'm much more shameless
than my sister.

1105
01:10:17,359 --> 01:10:19,319
You will love me.

1106
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:22,279
It will be satisfying.
