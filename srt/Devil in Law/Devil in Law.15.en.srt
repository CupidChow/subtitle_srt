1
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,479
Why did you tell Pawinee about me?

2
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,960
There you are.

3
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,599
That's her, Officer.

4
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,719
Please come with us.

5
00:02:50,599 --> 00:02:53,400
How long do you intend
to keep me here?

6
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:55,199
As long as possible.

7
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,479
Pa.

8
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,960
Is this even necessary?

9
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,360
- Nai!
- Come here!

10
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,199
Come here!

11
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,840
When did you find out

12
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,159
about Singkorn's plan
to take over our business?

13
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,479
I knew from the start.

14
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,719
He came to me for advice.

15
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,080
- What?
- What?

16
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:35,759
This means you have been
working with him to betray us.

17
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,080
Don't give me that face.

18
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,400
All of us know

19
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:45,120
that we have no eternal allies
and no perpetual enemies.

20
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,080
Or should I say

21
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,000
which of you came to me for advice

22
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,680
hoping to stab
a close friend in the back?

23
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:03,639
I think

24
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,840
we should listen to her

25
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,120
and go through the documents.

26
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
I agree.

27
00:04:11,759 --> 00:04:13,759
If Singkorn really betrays us,

28
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,439
we won't allow it.

29
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,480
(Tin)

30
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,759
Don't let me down.

31
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,120
You had a lot to drink.
Are you all right?

32
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:14,639
Hello.

33
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:17,439
Mom, where are you?

34
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:21,079
The hospital called you many times,
but you didn't pick up.

35
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,680
So they called me instead.

36
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,839
What's the matter?

37
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,199
Nai got stabbed, Mom.

38
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,720
Nai got stabbed?

39
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,920
What happened?

40
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:31,319
The hospital said

41
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:33,639
Nai got stabbed
while trying to save Pawinee

42
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,439
from getting kidnapped.

43
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:39,480
The kidnappers have got
Pawinee, Mom.

44
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,920
Have you called the police?

45
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,879
No, I'm in shock.

46
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,839
Mom?

47
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Mom?

48
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,079
Hello, sir.

49
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,839
I'm sorry
for calling you at this hour.

50
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,120
Sir, please give a direct order

51
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,959
so we can arrest those men.

52
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:12,639
And once you arrest them,

53
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,800
give them the worst
punishment possible.

54
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,319
Thank you.

55
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,040
What's it?

56
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,199
Madame.

57
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,279
My men have got Pawinee.

58
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,800
It was you who kidnapped Pawinee?

59
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:36,120
I followed your order.

60
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,160
When did I order you to do that?

61
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,800
Don't deny it.

62
00:06:42,399 --> 00:06:44,759
I got your message loud and clear.

63
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,639
What message?

64
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:52,360
I'm scared Pa and your son might
get the police involved.

65
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:53,600
If you're so scared,

66
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:55,800
why don't you find a way
to deal with it yourself?

67
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,959
You said you're quite
capable after all.

68
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,399
Yes, I said that.

69
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,879
But I didn't mean

70
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:06,959
for you to commit a crime.

71
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:09,319
Just get to the point.

72
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:12,839
If I wanted to take Pawinee down
by this extreme measure,

73
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:16,199
I would never hire
amateurs like you.

74
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:19,120
Wait. Don't tell me...

75
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:21,040
Are you behind my son's attack?

76
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,360
What attack?

77
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,519
One of your men stabbed my son.

78
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,079
Just you wait.

79
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,920
If anything happens to him,

80
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,240
I will make all of you pay for it.

81
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:34,360
Then I'll tell the world

82
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,439
that I only did it
to follow your order

83
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:39,279
and that you ordered me to kill her.

84
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,759
Do you have proof?

85
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,240
Your staff transferred me money.

86
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,920
Even though the money
was for something else,

87
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,199
it's proof

88
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,639
that you had hired me before.

89
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,600
Tin!

90
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,879
Let's make a deal.

91
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:56,839
Protect me and my men.

92
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,839
If I get arrested,

93
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,959
I will tell everyone

94
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,680
that you are in on it too.

95
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:18,839
Hello, sir.

96
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,959
After I thought about it,

97
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:24,879
it'd be best to let the local police
handle the case.

98
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,639
I don't want people to think badly
of me for using connections.

99
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,399
Thank you, sir.

100
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,090
Some pretty thing we got here.

101
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,480
She's beautiful.

102
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:14,210
Boss is here. I'll go get him.

103
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,279
Okay.

104
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:20,960
You are starring at her
without blinking.

105
00:09:25,159 --> 00:09:26,960
Boss, you are back.

106
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,210
I'll lock the gate.

107
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,799
It's fine. I got it.

108
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,120
Why did you stab Madame's son?

109
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,330
He got in our way.

110
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,840
It's getting me in trouble.

111
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,919
Did Madame Nuan tell you
what to do with the girl?

112
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,330
She said it was a misunderstanding.

113
00:09:44,879 --> 00:09:47,399
She said she never told me
to kidnap Pawinee.

114
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,679
Oh, what?

115
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,720
Madame ordered us

116
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,679
to leave her on the street.

117
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,879
Then lie low

118
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,210
while she sorts things out
with the police.

119
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,799
Boss is here.

120
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,039
Let's let her go then.

121
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,799
We'd be stupid to do that.

122
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,210
Look who we have.

123
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,879
How can we let her go?

124
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,720
What are you planning to do?

125
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,519
We are going to film her naked

126
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,240
and use the tape

127
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,879
to blackmail her later.

128
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:56,200
Keep an eye on her.

129
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,039
- You two, come to get some stuff.
- Yes, Boss.

130
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,240
Boss was right. She's gorgeous.

131
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,440
Hey, go see what's going on.

132
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,360
What's he doing up there?

133
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
No...

134
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,840
You...

135
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,200
Hey! Where do you think
you are going?

136
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,639
What's going on up here?

137
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,399
Hey, get her.

138
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,960
Hey, stop.

139
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,440
I said stop!

140
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,279
Stop!

141
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:23,799
Darn it!

142
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,360
Where are you going?

143
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,720
Boss.

144
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:37,799
Leave me.

145
00:12:38,039 --> 00:12:39,720
Go get her. Hurry!

146
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,279
Hey, stop!

147
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,679
Go after her.

148
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:03,120
Excuse me. Stop the car.

149
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,720
Stop the car. Help me.

150
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:07,120
Help me! Help!

151
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,440
Wait! Help me!

152
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,159
Go find her.

153
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,320
Mister.

154
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:18,720
Mister, help me.

155
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,679
Stop the car.

156
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Get in.

157
00:13:23,039 --> 00:13:24,120
Hurry!

158
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,960
Stop! Get back here.

159
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,679
Go!

160
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:29,440
- Get back here.
- Go!

161
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,639
Stop right there!

162
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,519
Darn it!

163
00:13:47,559 --> 00:13:50,879
(Operating Room)

164
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,000
Nade!

165
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:38,200
Trai drove me here, Mom.

166
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,480
How's Nai doing?

167
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,720
No one has come out.

168
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,360
Madame.

169
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,720
I've talked to the police.

170
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,240
They checked the security footage.

171
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,679
But the van that kidnapped
Ms. Pawinee

172
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:02,440
had no license plate.

173
00:15:02,519 --> 00:15:05,559
They were also able to dodge
other security cameras.

174
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,759
It's like they had it
all planned out.

175
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:11,639
However, the police are looking
for them as we speak.

176
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,440
What about the reporters?

177
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,600
They are waiting to interview you.

178
00:15:20,679 --> 00:15:22,080
There's not going to be
an interview.

179
00:15:22,159 --> 00:15:24,320
And tell everyone involved

180
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,799
not to say a thing to the media.

181
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,120
Yes.

182
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:34,799
(Tin)

183
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,320
How's it going?

184
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,759
I was going to leave her
on the street like you said.

185
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,799
But she suddenly woke up

186
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,559
and got away.

187
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:03,799
She got away?

188
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,639
How did this happen?

189
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:06,879
This means

190
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,840
she saw your faces.

191
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:10,799
She did.

192
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
Does she...

193
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,679
know about me?

194
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,600
I'm not sure. I'm calling
to give you a heads up.

195
00:16:19,679 --> 00:16:21,919
Keep her mouth shut.

196
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,960
If I go down,

197
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,200
I'm taking you down with me.

198
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,879
- Thank you.
- I hope your boyfriend's all right.

199
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,279
Thank you so much.

200
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,839
Excuse me, is there a patient
named Noppanai Wongkulthanasup?

201
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:16,240
Yes, he's in the operating room.

202
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:17,920
Thank you.

203
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,119
Hello, Madame.

204
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:12,960
(Operating Room)

205
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,680
Are you Noppanai's relative?

206
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:15,839
Yes.

207
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:17,650
What happened?

208
00:18:24,599 --> 00:18:25,759
Where were you?

209
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:29,170
You know where I was.

210
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:31,119
Wait.

211
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:33,359
I need to talk to you.

212
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,279
I'm going to see Nai.

213
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:36,759
Wait.

214
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,119
We need to talk

215
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,039
before you end up
spreading false rumors.

216
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,559
I'm going to see Nai.

217
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,650
Madame!

218
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,519
Hey, let me go.

219
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:50,839
- Madame.
- Let me go.

220
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,039
- Let me go.
- Madame!

221
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,480
The doctor said
Nai is losing a lot of blood.

222
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:55,519
He needs a blood transfusion.

223
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:57,359
Nai...

224
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:00,650
This way.

225
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,200
Ms. Pawinee.

226
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,440
- Yes?
- Mr. Panit has gone into shock.

227
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:05,839
His heart may stop beating.

228
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,720
The doctor is trying to save him.

229
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,559
Nai is losing a lot of blood.
He needs a blood transfusion.

230
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,200
Mr. Panit has gone into shock.

231
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:19,519
His heart may stop beating.

232
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:21,559
The doctor is trying to save him.

233
00:19:23,359 --> 00:19:25,240
Dad had a heart attack because...

234
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:29,079
She told your father
about your hit-and-run.

235
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,839
You have no right to kill my dad!

236
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,960
Did Madame Nuan tell you
what to do with the girl?

237
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:39,079
She said she never told me
to kidnap Pawinee.

238
00:19:39,759 --> 00:19:41,599
We are going to film her naked

239
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,960
and use the tape

240
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,720
to blackmail her later.

241
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:48,759
I need you to finally realize

242
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:50,920
why I had to warn you

243
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,720
not to be enemies with me.

244
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,839
I'm about to have no one left.

245
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:13,680
You have hurt everyone I love.

246
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:18,000
Everyone I love is dying.

247
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:19,119
All of them.

248
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,720
Is this what you have always wanted?

249
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,079
Is this what you have wanted?

250
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,759
You did everything

251
00:20:25,839 --> 00:20:28,680
because you wanted it
to be like this.

252
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:30,410
Is this what...

253
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,279
- Ms. Pa!
- Ms. Pa!

254
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:37,410
- Ms. Pa!
- Ms. Pa!

255
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,519
Da...

256
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,599
Where have you been all this time?

257
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:54,279
We miss you so much.

258
00:21:57,839 --> 00:22:00,079
I came to attend Dad's funeral.

259
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,119
Dad's funeral?

260
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:12,039
What happened?

261
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:15,279
Is our father dead?

262
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,720
It's your fault.

263
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,160
If you hadn't tried
to win Madame over,

264
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,359
he wouldn't be dead.

265
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
Pa.

266
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,000
It's time to stop.

267
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:44,359
End it before Madame makes
everything worse.

268
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:53,279
Promise me.

269
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,000
Promise that you will stop
before it's too late.

270
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,359
Stop trying to win Madame over.

271
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,599
She will never accept you
as her daughter-in-law.

272
00:23:10,839 --> 00:23:11,960
You have to stop

273
00:23:12,839 --> 00:23:15,240
before everything gets worse.

274
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,799
Promise me, Pa.

275
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,279
How are they?

276
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:48,319
Both of them are safe.

277
00:24:23,559 --> 00:24:24,839
All done.

278
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,039
Thank you very much.

279
00:24:53,119 --> 00:24:54,759
He's safe now.

280
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,400
You should go home
and get some rest.

281
00:24:58,759 --> 00:24:59,759
No.

282
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,160
I'm staying here with him.

283
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,359
Ms. Nade, you should go home then.

284
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,119
You can switch with Madame tomorrow.

285
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,400
I'm going home.

286
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,759
Mom's staying here with you, Nai.

287
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,720
Trai, let's go home.

288
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,000
- Trai.
- Yes?

289
00:26:36,039 --> 00:26:37,200
Let's go home.

290
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:41,759
Ms. Nade.

291
00:26:41,839 --> 00:26:43,599
Before Pa fainted,

292
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,960
she said

293
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,119
Madame was taking away

294
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,079
her loved ones.

295
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:53,039
It makes me think about us.

296
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,920
Madame.

297
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:14,839
Were you really not involved
in this incident?

298
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,640
I didn't mean for this to happen.

299
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,640
I'm sorry, son.

300
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:45,839
I'm sorry.

301
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,759
A maid said you asked to be picked
up last night. Where were you?

302
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,960
I was out with Thom.

303
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,680
Then there was an emergency,
and Thom couldn't drive me home.

304
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,720
Are you going to visit Nai?

305
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,640
No.

306
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,240
From now on,

307
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:49,160
I'm ordering you to stay away
from Madame's family.

308
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,839
Why?

309
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,519
Madame knows about your abortion.

310
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,720
She wanted you
as her daughter-in-law for my sake.

311
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,920
But she betrayed me last night.

312
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:07,440
I won't let her get away with it.

313
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,039
As for you,

314
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,480
I will set you up
with a rich old widower.

315
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,119
Should be easy to find one.

316
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,200
Why do you care so much
about my love life?

317
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,480
Because I don't want you
to die alone.

318
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:27,119
Don't worry about me.

319
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,799
I'm capable of finding myself a man.

320
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,799
Of cause you are.

321
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,640
But you always find unqualified men.

322
00:29:35,119 --> 00:29:38,480
Even a good-for-nothing like
Thomtawee isn't interested in you.

323
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,039
Dad...

324
00:29:41,559 --> 00:29:43,240
Do you think I'm stupid?

325
00:29:43,319 --> 00:29:45,440
You keep spending time with him

326
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:47,440
because you like him.

327
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,920
And how is it going?

328
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,920
Is he interested in you?

329
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,359
No.

330
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:55,160
Let me warn you now.

331
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:59,480
Don't be easy and try to win
his heart by sleeping with him.

332
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:04,720
Stop looking down on me!

333
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,799
You call me a bad woman

334
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,599
and damaged goods.

335
00:30:10,039 --> 00:30:13,759
No parents hurt their children
with those words.

336
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:18,200
Parents who want their children
to face reality say them.

337
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:19,640
Reality?

338
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,920
Let me tell you the truth.

339
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,720
I acted disobediently

340
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,519
and got myself knocked up

341
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,720
because I hated you.

342
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,960
I needed someone to protect me

343
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,839
and start a family with me.

344
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:37,799
A family that
you wouldn't be a part of.

345
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,160
Lita!

346
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,400
Lita, how could you say that to me?

347
00:30:44,599 --> 00:30:46,119
Come back and talk to me!

348
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,680
Lita!

349
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
Pa.

350
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:14,480
How are you feeling?

351
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,079
Thom.

352
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,559
How did I get here?

353
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:23,799
Well, you fainted last night.

354
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,839
Auntie Orn and Joy
stayed with you all night.

355
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,319
They just went home.

356
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,519
How are...

357
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:41,519
How are my father
and Nai doing, Thom?

358
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
They are safe now.

359
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,960
But the doctor isn't allowing

360
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,359
visitors to see your father.

361
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:56,000
Pa.

362
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,640
- Yes?
- A nurse asked me to give you this.

363
00:32:05,319 --> 00:32:07,160
- Thom.
- What?

364
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:10,599
I want to see Nai.

365
00:32:38,759 --> 00:32:40,240
How's he doing?

366
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,279
He's still unconscious.

367
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:45,440
A doctor just came to check on him.
There's nothing worrisome.

368
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:54,319
Doesn't he have anyone
to take care of him?

369
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:58,039
Madame Nuan and Mr. Tom
just went home this morning.

370
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,039
- Please excuse me.
- Thank you.

371
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,440
Thank you.

372
00:34:14,809 --> 00:34:15,880
Nai.

373
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,079
Nai...

374
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,599
Pa...

375
00:34:34,769 --> 00:34:36,329
Don't get up.

376
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,960
Pa, I'll get a nurse
to check on him.

377
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:41,559
Thank you.

378
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,480
Did those men hurt you last night?

379
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,039
No.

380
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:02,400
How did you escape from them?

381
00:35:03,519 --> 00:35:05,329
Come on, Nai.

382
00:35:06,769 --> 00:35:08,199
It's me you are talking to.

383
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:11,159
I'm invincible.

384
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,039
Don't worry about me.

385
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,880
Get some rest.
It will speed up the recovery.

386
00:35:43,769 --> 00:35:44,769
Come on!

387
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,239
Hurry!

388
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,329
Last night,

389
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,000
I thought I was dying.

390
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,809
But I told myself
that I couldn't die just yet...

391
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,880
as there is still
an unresolved issue.

392
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,769
What is it?

393
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,119
You and my mother.

394
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:32,440
I don't want to leave this world

395
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,199
knowing that my mother
hasn't accepted you

396
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:39,329
and the family

397
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:42,239
of my son's mother.

398
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:02,960
Nai.

399
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:09,639
Maybe we have to accept...

400
00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:15,679
that it will never happen.

401
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,119
Why does it sound like
you are giving up?

402
00:37:24,329 --> 00:37:25,599
I'm scared.

403
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:27,880
I'm scared

404
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,719
that bad stuff might happen again...

405
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,719
like it did to my father.

406
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,559
Nai, don't get up.

407
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,920
Nai.

408
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,199
I'm fine, Pa.

409
00:38:08,519 --> 00:38:09,880
It might

410
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,440
sound selfish, Pa.

411
00:38:17,719 --> 00:38:20,360
But I want you to be patient.

412
00:38:27,079 --> 00:38:29,519
I'll try to make everything better.

413
00:39:52,239 --> 00:39:54,880
Why on earth
is this bag so expensive?

414
00:39:56,679 --> 00:39:58,239
But who cares?

415
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,239
Let's order it.

416
00:40:04,239 --> 00:40:05,480
Jang, it's me.

417
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,360
Jang.

418
00:40:18,199 --> 00:40:19,289
Trai.

419
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,199
I thought you wanted to talk.

420
00:40:39,289 --> 00:40:40,840
Why is this hag here?

421
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,440
Did my mother hire you?

422
00:40:44,519 --> 00:40:45,880
What are you talking about?

423
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,159
If you tell us the truth...

424
00:40:50,679 --> 00:40:52,400
I will give you three million baht.

425
00:41:14,329 --> 00:41:16,880
I don't know how much money
my mother offered you.

426
00:41:17,159 --> 00:41:18,289
But let me warn you now.

427
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,809
My mother never gives money
to anyone easily.

428
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,039
She might not even pay you at all.

429
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:26,679
Isn't it better to grab
what's in front of you?

430
00:41:36,559 --> 00:41:38,599
Fine, I admit it.

431
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,199
Madame Nuan hired me

432
00:41:40,679 --> 00:41:45,360
to break you and Trai up.

433
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:12,360
Why...

434
00:42:13,329 --> 00:42:16,400
can't I trust my own mother?

435
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,769
What's the meaning of this?

436
00:43:03,159 --> 00:43:04,769
- It's fake money.
- Exactly.

437
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,079
It's in your best interest

438
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:07,769
to keep this from Madame Nuan.

439
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:10,329
If she finds out
that you betrayed her

440
00:43:10,639 --> 00:43:11,920
by taking cash from Ms. Nade,

441
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:14,329
she will make you pay twice for it.

442
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,159
Promise me, Pa.

443
00:45:00,559 --> 00:45:03,000
Stop trying to win Madame over.

444
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,719
She will never accept you
as her daughter-in-law.

445
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,079
Pa.

446
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,559
It's time to stop.

447
00:45:13,639 --> 00:45:16,639
End it before Madame makes
everything worse.

448
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:46,239
(Noppanai Wongkulthanasup)

449
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:53,679
I got you some food.

450
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,360
How's Nai doing?

451
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:02,000
Oh, he's sleeping.

452
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:05,480
Pa.

453
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:07,760
Why the long face?

454
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,599
Did something happen?

455
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,880
Well...

456
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,360
I'm caught in a dilemma.

457
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,559
Should I keep trying
to win Madame Nuan over?

458
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,320
Or should I just
break up with Nai, Thom?

459
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:31,760
What happened, Pa?

460
00:46:41,639 --> 00:46:44,280
Tin mistakenly thought Madame had
ordered him to hurt you?

461
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:47,000
Yes.

462
00:46:47,079 --> 00:46:49,760
How do you know
it was a misunderstanding?

463
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:53,880
I overheard Madame
telling them to let me go.

464
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,039
But they didn't listen to her.

465
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:01,159
I guess Madame still has
some good left in her.

466
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,599
If she was completely evil,

467
00:47:03,719 --> 00:47:05,920
she would not have shown any mercy.

468
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:17,159
Pa.

469
00:47:17,559 --> 00:47:18,800
Answer me something.

470
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:21,960
Why do you want
to break up with Nai?

471
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:25,719
Well.

472
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:28,639
Madame may not have
given them the order,

473
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,199
but those men thought she did
because she hates my guts.

474
00:47:34,239 --> 00:47:35,960
And if I don't walk out of here,

475
00:47:36,519 --> 00:47:38,519
something bad might happen again.

476
00:47:39,679 --> 00:47:41,800
My life is full
of uncertainties right now.

477
00:47:42,239 --> 00:47:46,400
It's hard enough for me that
Dad and Nai are in the hospital.

478
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,719
Pa.

479
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,239
I need you to calm down.

480
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,840
Think about it carefully.

481
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,920
You can talk to Nai once he recovers

482
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,000
and find a solution together.

483
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:04,440
You've finally found a man you love.

484
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,280
I don't want you to lose him
because of other people.

485
00:48:25,079 --> 00:48:26,079
Pa.

486
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:28,760
I think you should go home and rest.

487
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:31,639
I'll drop you off
on the way to work.

488
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:34,440
No, thank you.

489
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,199
I want to stay with Dad.

490
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:39,000
Even if I won't be allowed in,
I can wait in front of his room.

491
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:40,599
I'll take a taxi home later.

492
00:48:41,559 --> 00:48:44,440
What are you doing to do about Tin

493
00:48:44,519 --> 00:48:46,079
and Madame Nuan?

494
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:49,519
I refuse...

495
00:48:51,039 --> 00:48:53,079
to be assaulted for nothing.

496
00:48:53,719 --> 00:48:56,079
I'll use it as leverage
against Madame Nuan

497
00:48:56,159 --> 00:48:58,079
and get the information I want.

498
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:02,320
What information?

499
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:16,280
Here you are.

500
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:18,519
We need to talk.

501
00:49:24,679 --> 00:49:26,159
Tin mistook my message.

502
00:49:26,239 --> 00:49:28,360
I didn't order him to hurt you.

503
00:49:29,320 --> 00:49:31,320
I know you didn't mean to.

504
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,400
But do you have any idea

505
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,880
what I had to face last night

506
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:39,199
because of your little
misunderstanding?

507
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:45,840
They were going to film me naked
and use it to blackmail me.

508
00:49:53,519 --> 00:49:55,639
I'm sure Nai won't let it slide

509
00:49:56,360 --> 00:49:58,400
if he finds out about this.

510
00:50:03,519 --> 00:50:04,760
What do you want?

511
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:09,320
Are you trying to silence me?

512
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,400
You want something from me,
don't you?

513
00:50:14,159 --> 00:50:15,679
Tell me the truth.

514
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,840
What do you want from me?

515
00:50:19,159 --> 00:50:20,840
I want to know

516
00:50:21,679 --> 00:50:23,480
what really happened that night.

517
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,800
Lock her up in the storage room.

518
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,239
I'll deal with her later.

519
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,320
- Yes, Madame.
- Yes, Madame.

520
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:38,519
- No, Mother. Mother.
- Don't follow her.

521
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,079
Let go.

522
00:50:41,199 --> 00:50:42,280
So?

523
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:45,760
Did you intentionally
leave my sister to die alone

524
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:47,559
in the storage room?

525
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,119
No.

526
00:50:50,639 --> 00:50:51,960
It wasn't intentional.

527
00:50:53,559 --> 00:50:54,880
I admit

528
00:50:55,119 --> 00:50:58,760
that I didn't want Srikanda
as my daughter-in-law.

529
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:00,840
I mistreated her,

530
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:04,079
hoping she would find me
too unbearable

531
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,000
and divorce Nai.

532
00:51:06,559 --> 00:51:08,199
But I assure you

533
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:10,800
that I never wanted Srikanda to die.

534
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:13,360
What did Da ever do to you?

535
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:15,760
Why did you hate her so much?

536
00:51:17,039 --> 00:51:19,079
I didn't have anything
against your sister,

537
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,840
and I don't have anything
against you.

538
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:25,239
You two didn't do anything wrong.

539
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:29,039
The reason is actually my children.

540
00:51:30,639 --> 00:51:32,119
What do you mean?

541
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:39,840
Nai and Nade are too weak.

542
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:42,519
Both of them fail

543
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:45,280
to make me believe

544
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,159
that they will be able
to take care of themselves

545
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:50,599
after I'm gone.

546
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,880
That's why I want them
to marry someone

547
00:51:55,639 --> 00:51:58,079
who won't give them a hard life.

548
00:51:59,239 --> 00:52:00,960
Only then can I die in peace.

549
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:10,280
The truth is I thought

550
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,440
about breaking up with Nai.

551
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:17,800
Really?

552
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,360
I'm tired of our little war.

553
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:25,519
But after hearing the real reason

554
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:28,920
why you have been chasing
Da and me away from Nai,

555
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:33,679
I've changed my mind.

556
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,239
I'm not going to break up with him.

557
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,280
The problem

558
00:52:41,639 --> 00:52:43,639
isn't your children.

559
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:46,079
It's you.

560
00:52:46,239 --> 00:52:49,440
You judge your children
by your own standard

561
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,119
and assume they can't
take care of themselves.

562
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,320
But you are wrong about them.

563
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,360
Especially Nai.

564
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:58,360
He's a very strong man.

565
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,039
If I leave him

566
00:53:01,239 --> 00:53:03,800
to marry a woman you find him,

567
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,559
you might die in peace.

568
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:09,400
But you will put Nai in a living
hell for the rest of his life.

569
00:53:10,639 --> 00:53:13,159
I can't let that happen

570
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,480
because I love him.

571
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,760
Pawinee.

572
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,440
Come back and talk to me, Pawinee.

573
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,760
You have to break up
with Nai, Pawinee.

574
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,119
Is Dum home?

575
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,840
No, his son took him somewhere.

576
00:54:15,639 --> 00:54:16,639
His son?

577
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:18,519
Do you mean Tin?

578
00:54:19,039 --> 00:54:20,039
Yes.

579
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,480
In that case,

580
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,920
please tell him to call me
when he's back.

581
00:54:42,199 --> 00:54:43,519
How are you feeling, Mr. Nai?

582
00:54:44,719 --> 00:54:45,719
Tom.

583
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,000
Who's in charge of the case?

584
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,760
I'd like to talk to the officer.

585
00:54:51,159 --> 00:54:52,280
Why?

586
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:55,280
I remember one of the culprits.

587
00:54:57,960 --> 00:54:59,960
I saw him in front of Tin's house.

588
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:01,960
I'm certain

589
00:55:02,639 --> 00:55:04,719
Tin has something to do with it.

590
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:09,599
Can you please contact the officer
in charge of the case for me?

591
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:11,480
How about this?

592
00:55:11,719 --> 00:55:14,159
You should talk
to your mother first.

593
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:18,039
She can ask a superior officer
to help us with the case.

594
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:20,039
Get some rest.

595
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:21,719
I'll go get your mother.

596
00:55:41,519 --> 00:55:42,840
Excuse me.

597
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,800
Please don't move, Mr. Noppanai.

598
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,159
The doctor is on his way here.

599
00:55:58,239 --> 00:55:59,360
I see.

600
00:56:00,559 --> 00:56:02,400
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

601
00:56:09,039 --> 00:56:10,079
Madame.

602
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:12,559
Listen.

603
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:15,639
Mr. Nai found out that
those kidnappers work for Tin.

604
00:56:24,519 --> 00:56:27,039
Nai, are you awake?
How are you feeling?

605
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,840
Thank you for lending me your phone.

606
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,119
You are welcome.

607
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,920
The patient is recovering quickly.

608
00:56:45,159 --> 00:56:46,159
Nai.

609
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:48,159
Who did you call?

610
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,920
The police.

611
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:51,400
I saw one of the culprits' faces.

612
00:57:10,280 --> 00:57:12,239
Focus on your recovery.

613
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,599
I'll take care of the case.

614
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:16,519
It's fine, Mom.

615
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:18,559
Let me handle it.

616
00:57:19,239 --> 00:57:20,760
What are you going to do?

617
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:29,400
I think the kidnappers work for Tin.

618
00:57:30,360 --> 00:57:32,800
I have to find out
what they want from Pa

619
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,119
and use evidence to take them down.

620
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,800
Mom.

621
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,480
Take it easy, son.

622
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:46,119
Oh no.

623
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:48,039
Get some rest, Mr. Nai.

624
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:49,599
Madame.

625
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:52,239
You have an urgent call.
Let's go over there.

626
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,760
Madame, I think you should tell
Mr. Nai the truth.

627
00:58:05,079 --> 00:58:08,719
If he discovers
the truth on his own,

628
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:10,639
things will be worse for you.

629
00:58:16,639 --> 00:58:17,960
Is everything all right?

630
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:34,840
Nai.

631
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:37,880
Listen.

632
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:40,199
I have something to tell you.

633
00:58:45,239 --> 00:58:46,679
About last night...

634
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:55,639
Hey, it's a full house.

635
00:58:55,719 --> 00:58:59,199
Perfect, I have good news.

636
00:59:01,039 --> 00:59:02,079
Trai.

637
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:04,719
Don't be shy. Come here.

638
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:19,599
Trai and I are legally married now.

639
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:21,880
Ta-da.

640
00:59:28,159 --> 00:59:30,199
(Marriage Certificate)

641
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:33,880
(between Mr. Trai Haosamhon
and Ms. Nade Haosamhon)

642
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:38,039
Are you crazy, Nade?

643
00:59:38,239 --> 00:59:40,039
Trai has a wife and a baby.

644
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:41,960
How could you marry him?

645
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:49,880
Joobjang told me everything.

646
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:51,880
About what you had her do.

647
00:59:55,719 --> 00:59:56,719
Nade.

648
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,519
What's going on?

649
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:04,800
Mom hired Trai's ex-girlfriend

650
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,639
to lie to me

651
01:00:06,719 --> 01:00:09,639
that she was pregnant with
Trai's baby to break us up.

652
01:00:11,519 --> 01:00:13,000
Why did you do that, Mom?

653
01:00:15,559 --> 01:00:18,760
One day, both of you will thank me

654
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:23,199
for trying to stop you
from marrying a good-for-nothing.

655
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:27,920
Then let me thank you today
for making me realize

656
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,800
that you've never loved
or meant me well.

657
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:33,320
You do everything

658
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,079
to deceive me

659
01:00:35,559 --> 01:00:37,000
and make me think

660
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:38,599
that I will always have you

661
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:40,800
whenever I feel alone in this world.

662
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,719
But it's all a lie.

663
01:00:43,679 --> 01:00:46,119
I won't believe anything
you say from now on.

664
01:00:46,360 --> 01:00:48,639
I'm going to follow my heart.

665
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:54,840
Come on, Trai.

666
01:00:54,920 --> 01:00:58,719
Let's go back to your place
and consummate our marriage.

667
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:03,960
Nade!

668
01:01:04,519 --> 01:01:05,679
Nade!

669
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:06,760
Madame.

670
01:01:10,519 --> 01:01:12,559
Did you marry me

671
01:01:13,000 --> 01:01:14,639
just to get back at your mother?

672
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:16,199
No, I did not.

673
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,559
Nade.

674
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,320
Mom.

675
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,519
Pensri, hello.

676
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:28,599
Hey, Nade.

677
01:01:28,679 --> 01:01:31,719
Hello. Madame, hello.

678
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:32,800
Hello.

679
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,559
What are you doing here?

680
01:01:35,639 --> 01:01:39,280
I'm visiting Oak.
He underwent back surgery.

681
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:41,360
Who is this?

682
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:45,440
Well, this is Trai,

683
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:47,920
my husband.

684
01:01:49,239 --> 01:01:50,519
Husband?

685
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:53,559
When did you get married?

686
01:01:53,639 --> 01:01:55,320
We aren't married yet, actually.

687
01:01:55,400 --> 01:01:58,119
I'm planning to get married
after he knocks me up.

688
01:01:58,679 --> 01:02:03,199
Oh, right. I remember how much you
loved the chili paste at my house.

689
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:06,719
The chef who made
that chili paste is Trai's aunt.

690
01:02:08,920 --> 01:02:10,639
Please excuse us.

691
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:12,559
Goodbye.

692
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:14,440
Let's go, honey.

693
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:20,039
What's going on, Madame?

694
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,880
Within an hour, gossip about us
will be released to the public.

695
01:02:31,519 --> 01:02:33,360
This will teach my mother a lesson.

696
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:34,960
Nade!

697
01:02:36,679 --> 01:02:37,920
Give it to me.

698
01:02:41,239 --> 01:02:42,719
Give me back

699
01:02:43,719 --> 01:02:46,079
the car I bought you
and the credit cards I'm paying for.

700
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:51,400
Since you have a husband now,
I'm cutting you off.

701
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,639
Fine, you can take them.

702
01:02:59,239 --> 01:03:03,199
From now on,
I won't touch a penny of yours.

703
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,360
Let's go.

704
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:10,039
One day, you will regret
not listening to me.

705
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,360
Hello, Madame.

706
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:22,960
Turn yourself in.

707
01:03:23,719 --> 01:03:25,000
What are you talking about?

708
01:03:25,079 --> 01:03:27,280
One of your idiotic men
let Nai see his face.

709
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,559
Nai has told the police.

710
01:03:29,800 --> 01:03:31,360
You have to help us.

711
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:33,480
That's what I'm doing.

712
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,159
Turn yourself and your men in

713
01:03:36,239 --> 01:03:38,800
and confess that
you kidnapped Pawinee

714
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:40,840
for ransom.

715
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:42,840
Do not mention my name.

716
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,559
Don't let anyone know
that I was involved.

717
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:48,360
And I'll give you ten million baht.

718
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:50,440
The money will be useless

719
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,400
if I'm stuck in jail.

720
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:56,719
I'll hire a good lawyer to
get you out as soon as possible.

721
01:04:06,679 --> 01:04:07,880
Madame.

722
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,199
I don't think that's a good idea.

723
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,239
You saw what Nade did.

724
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:15,239
If Nai finds out, he will be furious

725
01:04:15,800 --> 01:04:18,239
and do something stupid
to get back at me

726
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:19,559
like Nade did.

727
01:04:19,639 --> 01:04:23,679
Would Ms. Pa be all right with it

728
01:04:24,159 --> 01:04:26,239
if Tin listened to you
and lied to the police?

729
01:04:27,639 --> 01:04:29,119
I'll talk to Pawinee about it.

730
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:31,880
Okay.

731
01:04:49,559 --> 01:04:50,679
How did it go?

732
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:52,480
Well.

733
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,480
The fight is currently put on hold.

734
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:57,239
Ms. Nade, Trai, and Madame
have left the hospital.

735
01:04:58,519 --> 01:04:59,519
By the way,

736
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:03,639
what did my mother want to say to me
before Nade walked in?

737
01:05:04,679 --> 01:05:06,639
Oh, it's nothing.

738
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:07,960
Madame

739
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:12,679
wants you to be mindful when you
speak to the police or other people.

740
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:14,960
Please don't mention
that Tin was ever at your house.

741
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:17,719
She's afraid
of getting dragged into the case.

742
01:05:17,840 --> 01:05:20,039
People nowadays
connect the wrong dots

743
01:05:20,119 --> 01:05:23,239
and gossip about it
without knowing the truth.

744
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:32,920
Dad.

745
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:36,840
I went downstairs, and the doctor
said you had been transferred here.

746
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:40,320
Call me if you need anything at all.

747
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:42,360
Thank you.

748
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,039
How are you feeling?
Are you in a lot of pain?

749
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,360
I'm in a bit of pain,

750
01:05:51,519 --> 01:05:53,559
but it's bearable. Don't worry.

751
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,480
By the way,

752
01:05:57,039 --> 01:05:58,119
what happened to you?

753
01:05:59,119 --> 01:06:01,159
I overheard the nurses saying

754
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:03,400
Nai was admitted here too.

755
01:06:07,199 --> 01:06:08,199
So?

756
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:13,360
Keep me updated, Captain.

757
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:16,119
Thank you.

758
01:06:22,039 --> 01:06:23,880
- Nai.
- Hey, Pa.

759
01:06:43,559 --> 01:06:44,880
Nai.

760
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:46,400
Take it easy.

761
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,159
You didn't have to visit me.

762
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:53,119
You don't need to get up
to greet your father-in-law.

763
01:06:53,199 --> 01:06:54,400
I don't mind.

764
01:06:58,119 --> 01:06:59,519
- Dad.
- What?

765
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:05,039
Do you realize that you just
called yourself his father-in-law?

766
01:07:07,719 --> 01:07:10,679
And do you realize that you totally
left me to be by his side?

767
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:12,280
Oh, right.

768
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,239
I'm sorry.

769
01:07:14,320 --> 01:07:16,800
- Unbelievable.
- What?

770
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,960
Gosh, this girl.

771
01:07:23,719 --> 01:07:25,400
It wasn't a mistake.

772
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,039
It was intentional.

773
01:07:28,280 --> 01:07:31,440
You sacrificed yourself
to save Pa's life after all.

774
01:07:33,239 --> 01:07:35,199
You are my son-in-law now.

775
01:07:39,199 --> 01:07:40,519
Your father knows?

776
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:43,840
Yes, I told him.

777
01:07:45,719 --> 01:07:49,000
Listen, once I get discharged,

778
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,159
I'll contact an organizer
and book a band.

779
01:07:52,719 --> 01:07:56,559
That way, we can host the wedding
when you recover.

780
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:58,599
What? Dad.

781
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,679
But you said you wanted my mother

782
01:08:02,760 --> 01:08:04,599
to ask for Pa's hand.

783
01:08:04,679 --> 01:08:06,239
Forget it.

784
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:09,159
If we wait for
Madame Nuan to do that,

785
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,800
your wedding may never happen.

786
01:08:12,119 --> 01:08:13,199
No.

787
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:16,960
I'll get my mother
to ask for Pa's hand.

788
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:20,760
A perfect wedding

789
01:08:21,159 --> 01:08:23,199
requires all family members

790
01:08:24,079 --> 01:08:25,840
to be present.

791
01:08:27,569 --> 01:08:28,609
Isn't that right, Pa?

792
01:08:36,199 --> 01:08:37,399
You are smiling from ear to ear.

793
01:08:38,649 --> 01:08:41,279
- Do you need that big of a smile?
- Dad!

794
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:07,399
Can you wash Nick's bottom?

795
01:09:07,479 --> 01:09:08,720
Wash his bottom?

796
01:09:10,199 --> 01:09:11,199
Ah!

797
01:09:11,279 --> 01:09:15,000
You were going to strengthen the
relationship between our families.

798
01:09:15,079 --> 01:09:17,279
- How did Nai find out?
- About what?

799
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:18,649
About me and Tin.

800
01:09:18,720 --> 01:09:19,880
What clip are you talking about?

801
01:09:19,960 --> 01:09:21,800
The one where she tried
to silence the kidnapper!

802
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:23,680
- Was that you?
- Madame.

803
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,079
Are you two

804
01:09:25,649 --> 01:09:28,279
thinking of disowning me?

805
01:09:28,439 --> 01:09:30,760
Nade and I know
you have your reasons,

806
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:32,609
But it's not something we want.

807
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,000
If you two will survive

808
01:09:34,569 --> 01:09:36,239
without me!

809
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:38,439
Madame.

810
01:09:38,439 --> 01:09:40,039
Didn't I tell you

811
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:43,159
that I wouldn't miss the next shot?
