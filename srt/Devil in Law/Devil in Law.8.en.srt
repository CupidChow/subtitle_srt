1
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,120
I'm leaving right now.

2
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,639
My phone is missing.

3
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:44,199
My mother took your phone?

4
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,439
Stay on the lookout.

5
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,039
Ah!

6
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,759
Madame, I know you are in there.

7
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,840
Hey. I have a gift for you!

8
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:52,400
Oh my goodness.

9
00:02:53,199 --> 00:02:54,599
Give me back Pa's phone.

10
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,719
No.

11
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,560
What were you trying
to do with Pa's phone?

12
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:02,719
I wanted to find out

13
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:05,639
my daughter-in-law's
deep dark secrets.

14
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,039
Nothing.

15
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,719
My daughter's a good person.
She wouldn't do such a thing.

16
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,599
Are you sure?

17
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,599
Are you looking
for a fight or something?

18
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,159
Dad.

19
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:17,599
Let's bring Nick inside.
He'll catch a cold out here.

20
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,800
Come on.

21
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,719
What's with that smirk?
Maybe another splash will do?

22
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,319
- Calm down, sir.
- Dad!

23
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,159
- Let's go, sir.
- Nick might get caught in it.

24
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,319
Go on, Dad.

25
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,560
Come on, sir.

26
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,840
I'd like to talk to
Madame in private.

27
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:40,400
I think you should
wait in her study.

28
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,879
She'll swing by
after she's gotten changed.

29
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,000
We can talk now.

30
00:03:44,479 --> 00:03:47,639
Or someone might die of agitation
at my house.

31
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:51,800
- Tom, leave us.
- Yes, Madame.

32
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,680
You asked Thom about my secret.

33
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:08,000
What secret do you think I'm hiding?

34
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,199
I was just asking

35
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,479
at random

36
00:04:13,759 --> 00:04:19,050
in case I might find something to
remove you as my daughter-in-law.

37
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:23,959
And it seems

38
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,519
I was onto something.

39
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,199
You're hiding some kind
of secret, aren't you?

40
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:38,079
It seems to be something
horrible for you as well.

41
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,839
That's why you don't want
your father to find out.

42
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,170
Maybe you still haven't realized

43
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:51,120
that I'm very good at finding out
other people's secrets.

44
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:57,959
Keep your secrets safe, Pawinee.

45
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,399
Because once I find out about them,

46
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,759
the world will also find out,

47
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,480
including your dad.

48
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:12,560
You're going to end up
in a living hell because of them.

49
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,399
How did it go, Madame?

50
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,439
I won't tolerate
any disrespect from Pa.

51
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:39,360
Once I'm done getting changed,

52
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,319
I'm going to tell her father
she's keeping secrets.

53
00:05:43,439 --> 00:05:44,839
And that'll cause a rift among them.

54
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,920
Mr. Tom,

55
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,040
what secret is she talking about?

56
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,639
Use the time you're wasting on being
curious to focus on work instead.

57
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,199
I was only asking.
Why the telling off?

58
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,439
You're right.

59
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,279
Mr. Tom refused to tell us.

60
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,839
Do you reckon Ms. Nade knows?

61
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,560
How should I know?

62
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:06,600
She wasn't there
at the pool, was she?

63
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:10,959
- Huh? Where is she?
- Huh? Where is she?

64
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,439
Sir, can I tend to Nick?
I need to wipe his face.

65
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:22,800
- Sure.
- It was a little too sunny.

66
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:25,279
- Aw.
- Huh?

67
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,360
What is that thing?

68
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,240
Oh? Ms. Nadedao?

69
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:31,800
What happened to you?

70
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,199
Hang on.

71
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,600
Just look at that.

72
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,800
That was tight.

73
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,040
Hurry up and untie me!

74
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,079
I'm telling Mom!

75
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,319
So how did the talk go?

76
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:13,839
Well,

77
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:17,639
I told her not to do that again.

78
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,959
Huh?

79
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:22,800
How could you let
such a serious thing slide?

80
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:25,439
Oh, I'm not going to.

81
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:29,920
But I'll have to think about how
I'm going to deal with her first.

82
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,199
- I'm going to take a shower.
- Sure.

83
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,040
This house is full of nutters.

84
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,879
Let's go back to Grandpa's
house instead, okay?

85
00:07:41,959 --> 00:07:44,319
It's a lot more fun there.
We get to play.

86
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:46,720
Does that feel
ticklish to the tummy?

87
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:07,639
Keep your secrets safe, Pawinee.

88
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,160
Because once I find out about them,

89
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,600
the world will also find out,

90
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:15,319
including your dad.

91
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,879
You're going to end up

92
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:22,120
in a living hell because of them.

93
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,090
How did it go, Pa?

94
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,600
She was caught in the act.

95
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,639
But don't worry that she'll be
angry and bail on us.

96
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:50,480
I've come up with a countermeasure.

97
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,090
Anyway, are you free right now?

98
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,840
Of course. Why?

99
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,639
Can you come with me to help
try and find that guy again?

100
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,159
I'd like to deal
with the trouble in my heart.

101
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,879
So Madame won't be able to use it
against me again.

102
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,120
All right. I'll drive over
and pick you up.

103
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,639
Okay. Thanks, Thom.

104
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:28,720
Ms. Nade? Where have you been?

105
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:31,450
Pa tied me up!

106
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:34,240
I'm telling Mom.

107
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:37,639
I'll tell her to call the cops
and get Pa charged with assault.

108
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:40,879
But I don't think she'll be happy

109
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,330
to hear you were cornered by Ms. Pa.

110
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:45,159
And there's a lot
on her mind right now.

111
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,759
You might get in trouble
if you tell her about it.

112
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,480
Mm! This is good!

113
00:10:02,679 --> 00:10:05,840
What's the rush, you two?
You could choke to death.

114
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:06,919
- Mm!
- Mm.

115
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,279
Oh?

116
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,559
Oh?

117
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,759
- Drink some water.
- Whoa.

118
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,519
Auntie Erb,
you have a golden tongue.

119
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,090
You can dictate destiny
with your words.

120
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:17,159
Well then.

121
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,120
Can you say something so Madame
forgets about my problem?

122
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,879
That way I'll be able
to pay off my debt.

123
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,960
I wish Madame forgets everything.

124
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:28,279
I wish you can pay off your debt.

125
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,000
Sathu.

126
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,840
We're eating quickly

127
00:10:31,919 --> 00:10:34,960
because we have to go
and keep ourselves up to date.

128
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:37,120
- That's right.
- Date? Who bought dates?

129
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:39,519
Weren't the ones Ms. Pa bought
good enough?

130
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,600
Hey, hey.

131
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,120
Up to date.

132
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,480
- Oh.
- Mm!

133
00:10:44,559 --> 00:10:47,919
So what are you two
keeping up to date about?

134
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:50,480
Madame's going to get back at Ms. Pa

135
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:52,679
by telling her dad

136
00:10:52,759 --> 00:10:55,240
that she's keeping a secret!

137
00:10:56,919 --> 00:11:01,000
You're wondering
what it is, aren't you?

138
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:09,519
We don't know either.
Tell us if you do.

139
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:13,480
Do you, Auntie?

140
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:14,639
No.

141
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,200
Uncle?

142
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,600
Do you?

143
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,679
No.

144
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,080
Do you?

145
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,519
I don't.

146
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,559
Let's hurry up.

147
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:34,120
Trai? Are you full already?

148
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,720
What's the hurry?

149
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,360
Madame's going to tell Uncle Nit
about Ms. Pa's secret.

150
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,039
Should I warn her?

151
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,679
No, I can't.
A fight might break out again.

152
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:50,159
Ah!

153
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,840
What should I do?

154
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,159
- Yes?
- Where are you now, Mr. Nai?

155
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,080
I just arrived. I'm about to park.

156
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:07,519
Okay.

157
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,279
What's going on?
Why were you waiting out here?

158
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,000
I need to talk to you.

159
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,240
Tom,

160
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,639
get Pawinee's father.

161
00:12:32,799 --> 00:12:34,039
And tell him

162
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:37,080
I want to discuss an important
matter about his daughter with him.

163
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:38,960
Yes, Madame.

164
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,519
There's no need to do that, Mom.

165
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,759
You should talk to me instead.

166
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,240
There's a lot we have to discuss.

167
00:13:04,679 --> 00:13:05,679
Nai,

168
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,320
before you chastise me,

169
00:13:08,919 --> 00:13:10,720
I want you to know

170
00:13:10,799 --> 00:13:13,919
I didn't mean to take
Pawinee's phone away.

171
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,639
I saw it on the ground,

172
00:13:15,799 --> 00:13:17,879
so I picked it up

173
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,000
because I wanted to know

174
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:24,840
if Pawinee and Thomtawee were
having an affair like they say.

175
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,320
But Chak and his friends
already confessed to me.

176
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:30,279
Chak? Who's Chak?

177
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,240
Chak,

178
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:35,320
the guy you hired to steal Pa's bag.

179
00:13:38,879 --> 00:13:40,879
He also told me

180
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,440
the reason the stove got left on

181
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:45,399
and Mr. Pinit's house
almost burned down

182
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,080
was also your order.

183
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,879
And the other night

184
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,440
you ordered him
to search Pa's bedroom

185
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,080
and found her diary.

186
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:07,519
All right.

187
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,519
I'll admit

188
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,480
I ordered those things.

189
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,399
But I did it

190
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,679
because I meant well for you, Nai.

191
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,279
I don't trust Pawinee.

192
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,720
I'm scared she might try to
take advantage of you.

193
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,159
Pa is a good person, Mom.

194
00:14:24,879 --> 00:14:28,840
What kind of good person marries
her own brother-in-law

195
00:14:28,919 --> 00:14:32,440
less than a month
after her sister passed away?

196
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,200
And what kind of good person

197
00:14:34,559 --> 00:14:36,320
marries his own sister-in-law

198
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,159
less than a month
after his wife passed away?

199
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,559
Nai,

200
00:14:39,639 --> 00:14:42,360
you've become more defiant
ever since you remarried.

201
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,840
I just wanted to remind you

202
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,320
that both Pa and I basically
did the same thing.

203
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,279
If you still see me
as a good person,

204
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,799
then Pa is one too.

205
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,000
And it doesn't mean
she's a bad person

206
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,000
for keeping secrets.

207
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,639
Does that mean

208
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,279
you know what her secret is?

209
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:17,879
I do.

210
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,000
Nai,

211
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,720
can you tell me about it?

212
00:15:23,799 --> 00:15:28,399
I promise to keep it between us.

213
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,000
Nai, just tell me.

214
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,159
I don't believe you.

215
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,200
Just know that Pa's secret

216
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:46,000
is about carelessness.

217
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,799
Just like your secret.

218
00:15:54,679 --> 00:15:55,799
What do you know about it?

219
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,720
That night

220
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:06,440
when you and Dad had a fight

221
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:08,919
before Dad fell ill,

222
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,639
I saw everything.

223
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:16,399
But don't worry, Mom.

224
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:19,840
I've never thought of you
as a bad person.

225
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:24,519
I understand you did it
because you love me and Nade.

226
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,600
But if you insist on finding out

227
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,679
about Pa's secret

228
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,480
to use it against her,

229
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,240
I'm going to tell Pa

230
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:38,159
your secret in return.

231
00:16:53,039 --> 00:16:54,440
Hello, Pa?

232
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,399
I'm about to arrive
at Madame Nuan's house.

233
00:16:58,159 --> 00:17:01,360
Okay. Wait downstairs for a bit.

234
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,240
It's already late. I don't want Dad
to know I left with you.

235
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,920
Oh, sure.

236
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,720
See you in a bit.

237
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,440
I'll be downstairs soon.

238
00:17:22,759 --> 00:17:23,960
Where are you going?

239
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,200
Pa,

240
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:31,170
you're mad because Mom's trying to
find out your secret, aren't you?

241
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,279
I didn't tell her.

242
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,559
There are only
three people who know.

243
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,279
If you didn't, then who did?

244
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:43,240
Let's go outside and talk.

245
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:44,650
I'm not going.

246
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,650
I'm going to find that guy's house

247
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,960
before Madame finds it

248
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,799
and ruins everything.

249
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,839
What did she do to you?

250
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,039
Why do you have to be this scared?

251
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,680
Trust me.

252
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,960
Trust that I'll be on your side

253
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,000
and protect you.

254
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,920
Madame threatened me.

255
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,319
She said

256
00:18:34,359 --> 00:18:38,000
she's going to find out my secret
and tell my dad about it.

257
00:18:40,359 --> 00:18:42,480
I'm not scared of her.

258
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:45,890
But I'm scared...

259
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,519
I'm scared

260
00:18:53,079 --> 00:18:56,000
My dad might hate me.

261
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:01,119
Someone like Madame

262
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,890
is capable of doing anything.

263
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,839
She even scared Da so much

264
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,680
that she kept her suffering

265
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:13,519
a secret until she died.

266
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,799
So why wouldn't she be capable
of doing this too?

267
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,440
Oh, Pa?

268
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,319
What are you doing here?

269
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:37,240
Can you not let him see me crying?
Things could get worse.

270
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,960
Oh? Hey!

271
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:45,359
Why are you two embracing
in the middle of the day?

272
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,559
Don't...

273
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:48,319
Aren't you at least embarrassed
the ghosts and spirits will see you?

274
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,440
We were just talking something out.

275
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,440
Things got carried away,

276
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,480
so we kissed a bit.

277
00:19:55,839 --> 00:19:56,960
Huh?

278
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,410
Well, not a bit.

279
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:01,680
Her lips are all bruised.

280
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:06,200
- Ouch!
- Pa!

281
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,079
Nai,

282
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:10,599
what are you saying?
I'm embarrassed.

283
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,799
Don't say anything else!
I don't want to hear it!

284
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:19,599
How could they do it
in the middle of the day?

285
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:27,079
He's probably so mad at me.

286
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:30,440
Why do these things keep happening?

287
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:32,410
Pa,

288
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:35,000
let's go outside and talk.

289
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:36,920
About what now?

290
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,319
I think it's time

291
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:41,599
we got a divorce.

292
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:58,720
Ms. Pa said if you can accept
her proposals,

293
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:01,720
she won't press charges
for stealing her phone.

294
00:21:06,079 --> 00:21:08,119
Excuse me while I read them out.

295
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,650
First, you must not
be bothered by Thomtawee

296
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,559
and continue to work with him
enthusiastically and willingly.

297
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,839
Second,

298
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,839
you must pay the full amount
of the bonus you still owe

299
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,559
the employees at the house.

300
00:21:33,559 --> 00:21:37,759
And you mustn't
charge Jai for the vase.

301
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:44,240
Third, you must post on social media
praising Mrs. Srikanda's goodness

302
00:21:44,319 --> 00:21:46,599
every day for one week.

303
00:21:53,839 --> 00:21:56,839
Ms. Pa also asked you to sign it.

304
00:21:57,319 --> 00:22:00,200
But if you're not okay with it,
I'll go and talk to her again.

305
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,640
There's no need.

306
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,759
Leave. I want to be alone.

307
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,160
I won't give in to you, Nai.

308
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,200
Thom,

309
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:53,039
I can't go with you anymore.

310
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:57,279
Nai's taking me out to talk
about an important matter.

311
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:05,799
What important matter? Why do you
have to go out and talk about it?

312
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,799
He could've just waited
until you came back.

313
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,119
I think he's trying to stop you
from going with me.

314
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:18,000
He wants to discuss divorce.

315
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,759
Divorce?

316
00:23:20,319 --> 00:23:21,640
- Mm.
- Really?

317
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,000
Yes.

318
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,559
He said it himself.
He wants a divorce.

319
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:30,039
But I feel bad.

320
00:23:30,119 --> 00:23:32,799
You came all the way here
to pick me up.

321
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,799
Just let me know
if you're not okay with it.

322
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,559
I don't have to go and talk.
I'll come with you instead.

323
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,440
Pa, I'm okay. Very, actually.

324
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,319
I think you should just hurry up
and settle the matter with him.

325
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,920
There's no need to feel bad.

326
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:47,799
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.
Then we can go looking for that guy.

327
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,119
That way we'll have the whole day
to look for him.

328
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,319
- Isn't that better?
- Thank you.

329
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,440
Go on.

330
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,200
- A divorce?
- Mm.

331
00:24:10,279 --> 00:24:12,160
But they just kissed.

332
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Kissed?

333
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,079
Who kissed whom?

334
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,720
Huh? What?

335
00:24:17,799 --> 00:24:18,799
Who said anything about kissing?

336
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,119
I asked

337
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,000
if things are really
going to be over.

338
00:24:23,079 --> 00:24:24,160
Of course.

339
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,359
Pa said Nai asked
for the divorce himself.

340
00:24:27,319 --> 00:24:29,680
I guess he's feeling guilty
for what his mom did today.

341
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:33,200
- Uncle.
- Hm?

342
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,680
Once Pa gets divorced,

343
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,680
can I go all in
and make a move on her?

344
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,039
Or I can just cut to the chase

345
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:45,079
and propose to her.

346
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,160
Name your price for the dowry.

347
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,079
If I can't afford it,
I'll pay in installments.

348
00:24:50,079 --> 00:24:52,759
Okay. Hold your horses.

349
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,279
Let's wait until
they're actually divorced.

350
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,880
Why did you say that?

351
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,079
Pa has feelings for him.

352
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,119
And I have to admit

353
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,920
Nai is one of the good guys.

354
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,359
It's a shame he's got a downside.

355
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,240
Madame Nuan is his mother,

356
00:25:14,319 --> 00:25:15,559
and he used to be

357
00:25:15,759 --> 00:25:17,599
Da's husband.

358
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,559
I'm worried

359
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,880
Pa might not want to divorce him.

360
00:25:35,759 --> 00:25:38,839
Do you come here often?

361
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,640
Yes, with Trai.

362
00:25:41,799 --> 00:25:43,359
We discuss our life problems.

363
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,720
Wait for me by the river bank.

364
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,160
I'll buy us some corn.

365
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,160
You don't have to. I'm not hungry.

366
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,039
It's for the birds.

367
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:19,960
Pa, can you give me a hand?

368
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,279
Where is the corn?

369
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:31,119
Oh, I asked them. They said
the birds aren't here today.

370
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,880
Open wide.

371
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:44,559
I'm not eating that.

372
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,920
Come on.

373
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:53,079
- Nai.
- Mm!

374
00:26:56,759 --> 00:26:58,480
So? Is it good?

375
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:05,160
I want to talk about
getting divorced.

376
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:08,200
We will. But you have to eat first.

377
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,319
You haven't had anything today.

378
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,839
If you're not going to eat,
then we're not going to talk.

379
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,599
Here.

380
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,359
Open up.

381
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:04,279
So are you really
going to divorce me?

382
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,880
You're so impatient.

383
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,359
Yes, I'm going to divorce you.

384
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,160
How come you're suddenly
willing to do so?

385
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:17,160
Is it because you realized
what kind of person Madame is?

386
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,079
It's actually because I'm feeling
sympathetic towards you.

387
00:28:20,839 --> 00:28:22,119
You've only just graduated.

388
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,880
You should be starting your own life

389
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,680
and building your own future.

390
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,839
You shouldn't waste your time
trying to win.

391
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:30,640
I'm doing it for Da.

392
00:28:31,119 --> 00:28:32,359
I believe

393
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,240
Da would agree with me

394
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:36,519
if she could see you now.

395
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,640
And what about Nick?

396
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,519
Nick?

397
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:53,039
Nick's happiness
is the top priority.

398
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,240
We'll help raise him together.

399
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:58,519
You and Father can bring him
to your house as often as you like.

400
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,319
He needs love from the woman
who loves him the most.

401
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,799
So he won't feel like he doesn't
have a mother in his life.

402
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,480
And that woman is you, Pa.

403
00:29:10,599 --> 00:29:11,880
Once he's grown up,

404
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,519
we'll let him decide
whom he wants to be with.

405
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:18,000
He might not choose either of us.

406
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Deal.

407
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,160
Divorce it is then.

408
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,480
I'm happy to take a step back

409
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,279
because I'm worried

410
00:29:38,839 --> 00:29:41,880
Madame might eventually
find out my secret,

411
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:43,640
and then my dad will know.

412
00:29:44,319 --> 00:29:46,119
I've already lost Da.

413
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,039
I don't want to lose him too.

414
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,640
But let's wait until Thom's
Health Plus project is over.

415
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,240
Then we can make it official.

416
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,200
That's a good idea.

417
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,079
Because if we get a divorce now,

418
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,359
his client might not want

419
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,960
Madame as his presenter.

420
00:30:10,359 --> 00:30:12,640
As for your feelings for me,

421
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,720
you don't have to forget them.

422
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,960
Even if we're divorced,

423
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,359
I'll still be single.

424
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,880
It's not wrong for you
to feel good about me.

425
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,160
What are you on about?

426
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,880
Do you remember when I told you
if you agree to work with Mom,

427
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,559
I'm going to tell you what I know?

428
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:35,240
Yes.

429
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:39,279
I heard your confession
to your father.

430
00:30:41,319 --> 00:30:43,440
Here is what's been bothering me.

431
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,720
I'm starting to fall for Nai.

432
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,079
What?

433
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,599
You were outside the door?

434
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,559
Mm.

435
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,880
Oh!

436
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:59,519
Nai, listen to me carefully.

437
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:03,400
You're misunderstanding everything.

438
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,119
It's already come to this,
and you're still being tight-lipped?

439
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,000
I'm not!

440
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:12,039
No, I don't believe you.

441
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:15,200
Nai, I really did lie
to my dad that day.

442
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:16,960
Did you lie to your dad

443
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,519
or your own heart?

444
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,440
What are you doing?

445
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,759
Making you say what's in your heart.

446
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,000
Huh?

447
00:31:40,079 --> 00:31:42,640
Where did you learn that from?

448
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,920
- Nai.
- Hm?

449
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,720
Listen to me carefully.

450
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:53,359
Get a grip and calm down.

451
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,039
That day,

452
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,680
I meant to tell my dad
about my secret.

453
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:02,240
But then I found out
he's got heart disease.

454
00:32:02,319 --> 00:32:05,680
So I had to lie and tell him
I have feelings for you.

455
00:32:10,839 --> 00:32:11,839
In conclusion,

456
00:32:12,759 --> 00:32:14,200
I was assuming things?

457
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:16,359
Yes,

458
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,039
you've assumed a lot.

459
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,079
It's okay, Nai.

460
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,279
You silly girl,

461
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:38,720
I'd love to give you an award
for being oh-so innocent.

462
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,960
Why are you saying that to me?

463
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:44,119
Anyway, is Nai around?

464
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,799
No,

465
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,519
he went to the bathroom.

466
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,839
I want to tell you

467
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,759
why don't you use this opportunity

468
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:56,240
to make the most out of
his misunderstanding?

469
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:01,000
Actually, when I found out
he thought I had feelings for him,

470
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:06,359
I thought that I should use it
to trick him into falling for me.

471
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:10,640
Then I'd make him head over heels
for me until Madame's heart breaks.

472
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,599
Attagirl.

473
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,039
So why don't you do it?

474
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:16,920
He's truly sincere

475
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,880
and cares about me, Joy.

476
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,720
How could I be that mean to him?

477
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:32,640
Besides,

478
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,359
if I break his heart,

479
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,960
the one who's going to
be affected the most is Nick.

480
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:39,519
If his dad and aunt hate each other,

481
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,519
he'll grow up having
mental health problems.

482
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,039
Just like Nai said,

483
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,599
Nick's happiness
takes the top priority.

484
00:33:50,079 --> 00:33:51,079
Mm.

485
00:33:52,319 --> 00:33:53,400
He's got a point.

486
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,559
I have to go. He's back.

487
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,160
Talk to you later.

488
00:34:11,559 --> 00:34:13,039
I decided to give her some support.

489
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,079
Thank you!

490
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,119
Thank you.

491
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,809
Should we go home?

492
00:34:32,329 --> 00:34:33,639
All right.

493
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,960
We haven't gotten divorced yet.

494
00:34:49,519 --> 00:34:50,809
You're still my wife.

495
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,329
And I still have the right
to take care of you.

496
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,360
Come on.

497
00:35:30,159 --> 00:35:31,400
Um...

498
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:35,559
I'm going to bed. I'm tired.

499
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:37,639
Okay. Goodnight, Pa.

500
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,239
After you.

501
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:47,329
Mm.

502
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:58,360
As for your feelings for me,

503
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,199
you don't have to forget them.

504
00:37:03,719 --> 00:37:04,809
Thank you.

505
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,559
We haven't gotten divorced yet.

506
00:37:08,119 --> 00:37:09,400
You're still my wife.

507
00:37:10,039 --> 00:37:12,039
And I still have the right
to take care of you.

508
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,639
I thought you said you were tired
and wanted to go to bed.

509
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,239
Uh, well...

510
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:40,289
I'm hungry.

511
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,199
So I came downstairs for a snack.

512
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,119
Don't lie to me.

513
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:53,199
I'm tired.

514
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,239
I'm going to hit the sack now.

515
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,599
I said don't lie to me.

516
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,519
So?

517
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,159
Hm?

518
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:10,039
Nai!

519
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,000
I'll tell you the truth then.

520
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,289
The thing is

521
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:17,880
I was waiting to make sure
my dad was asleep.

522
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,079
Otherwise, he might ask
about this evening again.

523
00:38:21,159 --> 00:38:23,809
And I'm exhausted.

524
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,400
I don't want to lie to him anymore.

525
00:38:51,809 --> 00:38:53,599
There's nothing else
to lie to him about.

526
00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:58,559
Go upstairs and get some rest.

527
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:44,119
Are you divorcing him?

528
00:39:44,769 --> 00:39:47,559
You startled me!

529
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:49,440
Why did you wake up?

530
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:51,559
I heard noises.

531
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,289
Anyway, forget it.

532
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:55,289
So are you divorcing him or not?

533
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,639
Huh? So what is it?

534
00:40:00,719 --> 00:40:02,329
- Calm down!
- What?

535
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,599
- Come here!
- Hm?

536
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,880
I am.

537
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,199
Hey!

538
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,329
Yes! Yes! Yes!

539
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,679
Woohoo! She's divorcing him!

540
00:40:17,769 --> 00:40:18,960
She's divorcing him!

541
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:20,769
- Dad!
- Woohoo!

542
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,679
Dad! Dad!

543
00:40:22,769 --> 00:40:28,039
But we'll have to wait until Thom's
collaboration with Madame is done.

544
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:31,289
Because if there is any bad news,
it's going to affect the job.

545
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:34,840
Is that going to take long?

546
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,480
One month,

547
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:37,880
tops.

548
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,719
Well then. Get the divorce papers
signed and ready.

549
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:42,679
Come on, Dad.

550
00:40:42,769 --> 00:40:44,199
There's no need for that.

551
00:40:44,289 --> 00:40:45,480
There it is.

552
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,639
You don't want
to divorce him, do you?

553
00:40:48,199 --> 00:40:49,519
It's not like that!

554
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:52,559
I just feel

555
00:40:52,809 --> 00:40:57,289
there's no difference
if I sign it now or in a month.

556
00:40:58,679 --> 00:41:00,239
I'm going to take a shower.

557
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,599
She's divorcing him!

558
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:14,840
All right, Thom.

559
00:41:15,289 --> 00:41:16,880
She's divorcing him!

560
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,159
Divorce!

561
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:30,960
Dao,

562
00:41:31,719 --> 00:41:33,400
I'll stay with him tonight.

563
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,769
Oh, of course.

564
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,519
Nick,

565
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,719
don't tell anyone

566
00:42:01,159 --> 00:42:03,039
I don't want to divorce
your aunt at all.

567
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,199
Good morning.

568
00:42:24,329 --> 00:42:25,519
Thank you.

569
00:42:26,809 --> 00:42:28,960
I've made an appointment
with a company

570
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,769
that specializes in building
a good public image for you.

571
00:42:30,809 --> 00:42:33,400
We need them to help us
come up with a good story.

572
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:36,920
So your profile can be
as interesting as other people's.

573
00:42:38,769 --> 00:42:40,480
What do you mean by that?

574
00:42:46,769 --> 00:42:48,679
Thom just sent me this morning.

575
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:53,159
His company's picked you as one of
the three strong women

576
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:54,639
for Health Plus.

577
00:43:01,769 --> 00:43:05,559
(Ms. Lalita)

578
00:43:07,809 --> 00:43:11,239
Here are your bonuses from
three years ago from Madame.

579
00:43:11,329 --> 00:43:12,559
Three years!

580
00:43:12,639 --> 00:43:13,769
Auntie Erb.

581
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,239
- Uncle Phol.
- Thank you.

582
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:18,000
- Dao.
- Thank you.

583
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,400
- Jai.
- Thank you!

584
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,440
As for the vase,

585
00:43:29,519 --> 00:43:31,440
Madame doesn't mind.

586
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:33,559
Really, Mr. Tom?

587
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:37,079
Yes, but be more careful
in the future.

588
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:38,159
- I will!
- Okay!

589
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:40,559
Mr. Tom,

590
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:41,960
I have a question.

591
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,480
Fire away.

592
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,360
What about ours?

593
00:43:46,599 --> 00:43:49,880
Madame said you've
received too much.

594
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:56,119
Oh? What are you waiting for?

595
00:43:56,199 --> 00:43:57,519
One, two, three!

596
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,800
- Yay!
- Yes!

597
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:02,960
Three years!

598
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,199
- Let's have a look!
- Ah!

599
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,559
This is awesome!

600
00:44:09,639 --> 00:44:12,239
Oh? Why are you two standing there?

601
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,159
Why don't you bring Madame more tea?

602
00:44:14,239 --> 00:44:18,159
No bonus, no motivation.

603
00:44:18,239 --> 00:44:19,920
If anyone's motivated,

604
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,960
you can do it for me. Go on.

605
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:25,800
Listen to her.
She just wants to slack off.

606
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:36,000
Sompit!

607
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:37,440
Tang!

608
00:44:39,639 --> 00:44:40,719
Oh, Ms. Nade?

609
00:44:42,039 --> 00:44:44,119
Where are Sompit and Tang?
Where is everyone?

610
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:45,960
They're in the kitchen.

611
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:47,800
Would you like me
to go and get them?

612
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,480
Is Trai there as well?

613
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:51,239
He is.

614
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:54,119
Well then. Get him for me instead.

615
00:44:54,199 --> 00:44:56,280
I was going to ask Sompit
and Tang to go and get him.

616
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:00,239
Tell him I'll be waiting
in my bedroom.

617
00:45:00,519 --> 00:45:01,519
Okay?

618
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:09,559
Ms. Nade.

619
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:12,000
Ms. Nade.

620
00:45:13,159 --> 00:45:14,840
Can I ask you something?

621
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:17,320
Have you and Trai already
slept with each other?

622
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:20,039
That's an appalling question!

623
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,119
Not yet.

624
00:45:23,079 --> 00:45:24,880
So the opposite might be true
in the future.

625
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:28,280
And most likely
the near future, correct?

626
00:45:29,639 --> 00:45:30,800
Are you crazy?

627
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,400
I wanted to see him
because I wanted to ask him

628
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:37,519
why he didn't sleep
in the guest bedroom last night.

629
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:39,480
You do know

630
00:45:39,679 --> 00:45:43,320
how angry Madame will be
if she finds out there's something

631
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,599
between you and the nephew
of a servant in the house.

632
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,239
Then don't tell her.

633
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:50,559
I won't.

634
00:45:50,840 --> 00:45:53,000
Because I love and care about her.

635
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,519
You're her daughter.

636
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,519
Please don't upset her.

637
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:00,440
Mr. Nai and Ms. Pawinee

638
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:03,719
are giving her
enough headaches as it is.

639
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:09,159
I hope you don't cause her
any more grievances.

640
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,519
Mm!

641
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:18,679
Don't disappoint me.

642
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,320
Where have you been, Tom?

643
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,039
Ms. Nade would like the list
of the companies and clients

644
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:37,519
you're a consultant for.

645
00:46:37,679 --> 00:46:42,360
She'd like to seriously
learn the ropes from you.

646
00:46:43,159 --> 00:46:45,880
Nade wants to learn the ropes?

647
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,400
How is that even possible?

648
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,079
Time changes, people change.

649
00:46:53,159 --> 00:46:55,519
Who were you calling just now?

650
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:58,159
A private eye in the US.

651
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:01,199
I asked him to look
into Pawinee's secret.

652
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,559
Do you have to do that much?

653
00:47:04,199 --> 00:47:07,599
She and her father
have caused me anguish,

654
00:47:08,039 --> 00:47:10,320
humiliated me,

655
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:13,719
and brainwashed my son
into siding with them.

656
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:17,480
If her secret can kill them,

657
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:19,159
then I'm going to reveal it!

658
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,480
Thanks, Thom.

659
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:38,119
Bye.

660
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:43,719
- Auntie Orn! Joy!
- Here I am!

661
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,519
- Hello!
- Hello!

662
00:47:45,639 --> 00:47:47,519
- Hello, Auntie Orn.
- Hello.

663
00:47:48,239 --> 00:47:49,679
Where did you both go?

664
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:52,239
For my annual check-up.

665
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,880
I've missed Nick,
so I asked Joy to give me a lift.

666
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,639
That's right.
And where were you two?

667
00:47:57,719 --> 00:47:59,440
Oh, we had a meeting with a client.

668
00:47:59,519 --> 00:48:02,599
It was in the area,
so I decided to drop Pa off.

669
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:05,599
Anyway, I have to go now.

670
00:48:06,159 --> 00:48:07,920
How come? Won't you stay for a chat?

671
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,960
Oh, I have a meeting with a friend.

672
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:11,400
I didn't know you were coming.

673
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:13,239
- It's okay.
- Maybe next time.

674
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:14,920
- Sure, sure.
- Bye, Auntie Orn.

675
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,599
- Bye.
- Bye.

676
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,440
- Shall we?
- Of course. I miss my nephew.

677
00:48:25,559 --> 00:48:26,559
Let's head inside.

678
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:28,440
Here.

679
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:31,199
Dad!

680
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:33,559
- Nit! Nit!
- Dad!

681
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:35,800
- Nit! Nit!
- Dad!

682
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,239
- Nit, how are you feeling?
- Dad!

683
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:38,400
There's no one else here?

684
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,880
- Nit!
- Dad!

685
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,199
Isn't there anyone here? Nit!

686
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,760
What's wrong with you, Dad?

687
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:44,320
Is anyone around?

688
00:48:48,519 --> 00:48:49,840
Boo!

689
00:48:49,920 --> 00:48:52,760
- Yay!
- Surprise!

690
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:56,280
Woohoo!

691
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:57,679
Whoo!

692
00:49:03,159 --> 00:49:05,920
What's going on, Dad?

693
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,480
We'd like to throw you a party
for helping us get our bonuses!

694
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:11,559
Hang on!

695
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,760
Why did you have to go that far?
You almost gave me a heart attack!

696
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,679
It was my idea.

697
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,480
I'm super happy right now!
It's like being reborn!

698
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:23,800
Really!

699
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,440
I'll go and get the food
from the kitchen.

700
00:49:25,559 --> 00:49:27,199
Auntie Erb's cooked up a storm.

701
00:49:28,199 --> 00:49:29,960
I'll go and check on Nick.

702
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:32,199
If he's up, I'll bring him down
to join the party.

703
00:49:32,280 --> 00:49:35,719
Hurry up, won't you? I'm dying
to play with my nephew!

704
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:37,800
- Oh dear!
- It's such a mess!

705
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,679
Let me ask something.
Who's going to clean it up?

706
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,440
Ms. Pa, I need to tell you
something important.

707
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:43,840
This way, please.

708
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,679
Madame hired a detective
to look into my past.

709
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,960
That's right.
A very good one from the US.

710
00:49:50,519 --> 00:49:51,880
Ugh!

711
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:54,719
She said she's going
to use your secret

712
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:57,480
against you and your dad.

713
00:49:57,559 --> 00:50:00,519
She's going all out.

714
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:02,760
She still isn't backing down?

715
00:50:04,559 --> 00:50:08,519
I actually would like to know
what your secret is.

716
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:10,559
But I'm polite enough.

717
00:50:10,679 --> 00:50:12,039
I shouldn't be asking.

718
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:15,920
If you want to tell me,
you'll do it on your own.

719
00:50:19,079 --> 00:50:20,599
I'd rather not say.

720
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,880
Not a problem.

721
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:26,840
I still love you no matter what.

722
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,000
Okay.

723
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,159
Anyway, do you know how you're
going to deal with Madame?

724
00:50:33,679 --> 00:50:35,440
Give me some time to think about it.

725
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,519
You have to fight fire with fire.

726
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,800
Since Madame's going to use
your secret against you,

727
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:48,960
then you should do the same.

728
00:50:52,320 --> 00:50:54,760
But I don't know any of her secrets.

729
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:02,519
You do?

730
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:06,519
Indeed.

731
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:11,639
I know who you can
extract them from.

732
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:19,280
Mr. Singkorn!

733
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:25,159
If there's a problem,
we should talk about it!

734
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,639
I don't like it when someone
walks away from me!

735
00:51:27,719 --> 00:51:29,679
I've already told you
what my expectations are.

736
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,960
The concession for this project
has to be mine only.

737
00:51:33,159 --> 00:51:36,719
But I have an agreement in place
with Mr. Pichit that I'd help.

738
00:51:37,159 --> 00:51:39,239
Don't overlook me
in favor of someone else.

739
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:40,920
I think you know

740
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:43,199
I know everything about you.

741
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,320
Are you threatening me?

742
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:51,039
Don't think so
negatively of me, Madame.

743
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,880
I'm just reminding you

744
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,719
I'm the true friend you should keep.

745
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:01,400
Someone like me
who's kept your secret for years

746
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,360
won't be easy to replace.

747
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,320
Mr. Singkorn?

748
00:52:11,639 --> 00:52:12,800
That's right.

749
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,199
I haven't told anyone about this.

750
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,280
But I'm telling you now

751
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,320
because I want to arm you with
something to go up against Madame.

752
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,679
So you can stay here forever
for our sake.

753
00:52:26,679 --> 00:52:27,880
Thank you, Jai.

754
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:31,320
I won't disappoint you.

755
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:33,719
Good luck.

756
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:39,840
You asked to see me today

757
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:43,360
because you found out I picked
you as one of the presenters?

758
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:47,280
I have many friends
who are product owners.

759
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:50,559
- Mm.
- I can reach out if you need work

760
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:53,599
so that you won't have to pick me
just to schmooze my dad.

761
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:55,960
I think you're
misunderstanding something.

762
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:57,800
I picked you

763
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,400
not to impress your dad.

764
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,239
But I picked you because you
really are a strong woman.

765
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:10,800
You had the courage to tell me
about your past mistakes

766
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,599
because you didn't want your dad
to use his connections

767
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:14,039
to get you picked.

768
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:18,599
I think that is very brave.

769
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,480
And you've gone through

770
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,840
very horrible things in the past.

771
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,800
But you didn't hurt yourself

772
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:31,440
and kept moving forward.

773
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:34,920
How isn't that strong?

774
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:41,960
Mm!

775
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,880
I'm sorry. I didn't notice
it ran out.

776
00:53:45,679 --> 00:53:48,840
Excuse me? Can I have
another iced latte, please?

777
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,039
- Hey.
- Hm?

778
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:55,440
Can I discuss something with you?

779
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,159
Mm.

780
00:53:57,239 --> 00:54:01,079
What's good about Nai?
Why is everyone so fond of him?

781
00:54:02,599 --> 00:54:03,719
Why are you asking?

782
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:09,159
I'd like girls to be fond of me too.

783
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:13,679
That might be a bit of a stretch.

784
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:14,760
Come on!

785
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:20,320
Nai's a gentleman.

786
00:54:20,719 --> 00:54:21,920
He's sincere,

787
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,800
kind,

788
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,039
and generous,

789
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,320
especially with women.

790
00:54:28,719 --> 00:54:30,079
But it's probably because

791
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:32,199
there are a lot of
women at his house.

792
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:34,679
That's why he understands them well.

793
00:54:35,199 --> 00:54:36,199
I think that's it.

794
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:37,360
I see.

795
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:45,840
Oh? Lalita,

796
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,719
why didn't you wait for me inside?

797
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:50,840
It's okay.

798
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,079
I was going to ask

799
00:54:55,159 --> 00:54:57,960
why you bought so much.

800
00:54:58,039 --> 00:55:00,800
You were late,
so I went shopping to kill time.

801
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,320
I'm sorry.

802
00:55:02,599 --> 00:55:03,639
Here. I'll give you a hand.

803
00:55:03,719 --> 00:55:05,559
Oh, it's okay!

804
00:55:05,639 --> 00:55:06,960
Why not?

805
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:09,800
I just want to try to be like Nai.

806
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:11,920
Gentle and kind, that kind of thing.

807
00:55:12,039 --> 00:55:13,400
Here.

808
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:14,840
All right.

809
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:19,039
- It was a joke.
- Really.

810
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,159
Don't be like Nai.

811
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,639
Why not?

812
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:25,320
It's impossible.

813
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:27,719
How could you say that?

814
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:34,639
- What is it?
- It's Nai.

815
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,840
Speak of the devil.

816
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,760
Come on. Let's go and say hi to him.

817
00:55:42,719 --> 00:55:45,239
You look rather beautiful
today as well.

818
00:55:46,679 --> 00:55:48,360
- Come on.
- Uh, Thom.

819
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,519
We can't let him see us together.

820
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:52,840
- Let's go!
- Why not?

821
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,159
Just come!

822
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:55,480
- See you later.
- Bye.

823
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:02,639
Hurry up!

824
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:09,920
We can stop now.
He's not following us.

825
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:11,920
- Really?
- Mm.

826
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:18,679
That's a relief.

827
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:21,760
Lalita,

828
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,400
seriously.

829
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:26,880
Is it so appalling
to be seen with me?

830
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:28,639
It's not.

831
00:56:28,719 --> 00:56:34,000
I just don't want Nai to wonder
why we're hanging out together.

832
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,559
You could just tell him
we had a meeting about work.

833
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,719
Do you think I'm a good liar?

834
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:41,320
Uh, you've got a point.

835
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,400
Thank you very much.

836
00:56:55,159 --> 00:56:57,800
I'll let one of my staff
do an interview with you.

837
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,400
Mm.

838
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,679
Here.

839
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:01,760
Hang on.

840
00:57:02,039 --> 00:57:03,519
You still haven't answered me.

841
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:07,320
Why can't a guy like me be like Nai?

842
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,960
And why would you want to be
like someone else?

843
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:15,199
Let people like you for being you.

844
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:20,639
Come on.

845
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,639
- Bye.
- Bye.

846
00:57:37,679 --> 00:57:40,440
Well, that's true.

847
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,400
A guy like me

848
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,400
has way more charm than he does.

849
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,760
Are you talking to me?

850
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:50,440
Nope.

851
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,840
- My apologies.
- No problem.

852
00:57:58,199 --> 00:57:59,199
Thom?

853
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:03,159
Oh? Nai.

854
00:58:04,719 --> 00:58:06,960
Why did you and Lita
run away from me?

855
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:10,960
Shouldn't you go
and ask her yourself?

856
00:58:12,039 --> 00:58:14,800
Are you and her...

857
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:19,039
Do you think we're secretly dating?

858
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:21,960
You can forget about that.

859
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,280
Because in my heart,

860
00:58:24,519 --> 00:58:26,199
there's only room for Pa.

861
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:30,159
And I'm rushing to finish
the Health Plus project

862
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:32,159
because I want it to be over soon.

863
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:34,480
And I hope

864
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:36,400
you're going to be a gentleman

865
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:40,039
and keep your word to divorce Pa

866
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,920
as soon as the project's over.

867
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:03,519
Is there anything else?

868
00:59:04,519 --> 00:59:05,719
That's my car.

869
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,039
Okay.

870
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,480
I'll keep my word.

871
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,559
But you have to respect Pa too.

872
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:22,559
Actually, no.

873
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:26,599
I should say please respect
my lawfully-wedded wife.

874
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,719
We're not divorced yet.

875
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:30,960
You shouldn't go around saying
you have feelings for her.

876
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,039
Because if anyone hears you,

877
00:59:33,519 --> 00:59:35,440
Pa might be seen
in a negative light.

878
00:59:35,519 --> 00:59:39,119
I think you should
go home and ask Pa

879
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,199
if she even cares about
tarnishing her reputation

880
00:59:41,199 --> 00:59:44,159
as your lawfully-wedded wife.

881
00:59:46,639 --> 00:59:47,760
Excuse me.

882
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,960
I'll see you tonight, Mr. Singkorn.

883
01:00:03,760 --> 01:00:05,920
- Tonight?
- Mm.

884
01:00:06,039 --> 01:00:07,360
That's very soon.

885
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,119
His company will be welcoming

886
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:13,920
some social media influencers
from the US.

887
01:00:14,599 --> 01:00:16,599
Social media influencers?

888
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:20,519
They're someone influential
on social media.

889
01:00:20,599 --> 01:00:23,119
They flew in to discuss work
at Mr. Singkorn's company.

890
01:00:23,320 --> 01:00:25,760
Once they've posted a photo
on social media,

891
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:28,559
he gets to promote
his company internationally

892
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:30,119
without having to invest anything.

893
01:00:31,559 --> 01:00:34,159
And how are you going to get him
to tell you about the secret?

894
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:36,119
Hm.

895
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:38,559
I don't know yet.

896
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,519
But I'll find a way.

897
01:00:41,960 --> 01:00:44,679
Nai should know
his mother's secret too.

898
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,840
Wouldn't it be easier
to find out from him?

899
01:00:47,679 --> 01:00:52,239
Joy, he knows I intend
to get back at his mom.

900
01:00:52,599 --> 01:00:54,360
He wouldn't tell me.

901
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:09,199
Do you come here often?

902
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:11,920
Yes, with Trai.

903
01:01:12,119 --> 01:01:13,679
We discuss our life problems.

904
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:24,119
Why are you looking at Trai?

905
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:29,519
Nai told me he discusses
his life problems with Trai.

906
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:32,400
And if he does that often,

907
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:35,679
Trai might know
about Madame's secret.

908
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:38,360
I should find out from him.

909
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,639
Hey, Pa!

910
01:01:39,719 --> 01:01:40,920
- What?
- Wait, wait!

911
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,280
Keep it down!

912
01:01:42,519 --> 01:01:46,119
People here know you don't
get along with Madame.

913
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:48,159
I don't think anyone's
going to tell you.

914
01:01:49,719 --> 01:01:51,320
Let me handle this.

915
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:54,519
I know what's going to
convince him to fess up.

916
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,400
What is he doing?

917
01:02:48,719 --> 01:02:51,559
Gee, I didn't realize you got
all that going on underneath.

918
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,199
I have to. I don't want
to miss out on the trend.

919
01:02:57,159 --> 01:02:59,800
It's okay. I'm just going
to chat for a bit.

920
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,000
Oh, sure.

921
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,840
When are you going back to work?

922
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:09,800
My annual leave is about to be over.

923
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,960
Did you take annual leave?

924
01:03:13,519 --> 01:03:14,920
Or were you fired?

925
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,519
My friend works
at the same company as you.

926
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:24,960
Please don't tell anyone,

927
01:03:25,519 --> 01:03:28,079
especially not Auntie Erb.
She expects a lot from me.

928
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,280
Let's go and talk over there.

929
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:38,519
I'm sorry!

930
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,400
Not yet!

931
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:44,599
Not yet what?

932
01:03:44,679 --> 01:03:46,599
Don't let me go just yet.

933
01:03:46,679 --> 01:03:49,800
I don't know if I sprained
my ankle or not.

934
01:03:58,039 --> 01:03:59,320
I'll have a look.

935
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:06,199
Take it slow.

936
01:04:10,320 --> 01:04:12,760
- Which one?
- The right one.

937
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:15,079
What are you two doing? Come here!

938
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,360
Ms. Nade!

939
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:19,599
- Get up! Come here!
- Ms. Nade!

940
01:04:19,679 --> 01:04:21,480
Don't, Ms. Nade! That's enough!

941
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,440
- That's enough, Ms. Nade
- That slap

942
01:04:25,519 --> 01:04:27,000
was for your boldness!

943
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:29,360
But this one's for my anger!

944
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:32,719
Ms. Nade! Ms. Nade!

945
01:04:34,679 --> 01:04:35,679
Ms. Nade!

946
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:40,039
- Joy!
- Ms. Nade, that's enough!

947
01:04:40,119 --> 01:04:42,239
- That's enough!
- Joy! Joy!

948
01:04:43,039 --> 01:04:44,440
What's wrong with you?

949
01:04:46,119 --> 01:04:47,280
Where are you going?

950
01:04:50,199 --> 01:04:51,639
- Joy!
- Ms. Nade!

951
01:04:52,239 --> 01:04:53,760
Joy!

952
01:04:56,239 --> 01:04:57,960
You were seducing
someone else's boyfriend,

953
01:04:58,039 --> 01:04:59,719
yet you dared to slap me?

954
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:01,360
- Boyfriend?
- Boyfriend?

955
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:03,360
- Ms. Nade, enough!
- Enough! Stop!

956
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:04,760
- Joy!
- That's enough!

957
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:06,440
Enough, Ms. Nade!

958
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,719
- Hey!
- Ms. Nade!

959
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,559
Aren't you going to stop them?

960
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:17,000
Come on!

961
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,360
Please calm down!

962
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,760
Stop! I'm begging you!

963
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:23,239
Don't hurt my Ms. Nade!

964
01:05:23,239 --> 01:05:25,039
Let's talk it out nicely!

965
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:31,320
Do you want a piece of me?

966
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:33,519
Don't hurt my Ms. Nade!

967
01:05:34,880 --> 01:05:37,719
Shorten the dress for the event.

968
01:05:37,800 --> 01:05:40,920
There are steps
leading up to the stage.

969
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:43,800
It would look bad if I had
to keep looking down.

970
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:45,400
Of course, Madame.

971
01:05:47,039 --> 01:05:48,599
Madame! Madame!

972
01:05:49,199 --> 01:05:51,559
Ms. Nade's in a catfight
with Ms. Pa's friend!

973
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:56,519
Excuse me.

974
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:04,440
You should go inside
and look at the catalog.

975
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,159
There are many more dresses.

976
01:06:09,880 --> 01:06:11,159
- Here you are.
- Let me have a look.

977
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,079
- Pit, hold on to her.
- Okay.

978
01:06:24,360 --> 01:06:25,440
Let's not do this.

979
01:06:25,679 --> 01:06:27,079
Come on, Joy.

980
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:29,000
Where are you going,
you brazen wench?

981
01:06:29,079 --> 01:06:30,559
Just stop already!

982
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:38,159
Tell me. How long has she
been trying to seduce you?

983
01:06:38,239 --> 01:06:39,320
Has it been a while?

984
01:06:39,400 --> 01:06:40,760
Are you crazy?

985
01:06:41,239 --> 01:06:42,440
I never seduced him!

986
01:06:42,519 --> 01:06:43,639
Liar!

987
01:06:44,199 --> 01:06:46,039
It's so obvious

988
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:48,480
you were seducing my boyfriend.

989
01:06:48,679 --> 01:06:49,840
- Boyfriend?
- Boyfriend?

990
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:54,519
Ms. Nade, please stop saying
you're my girlfriend.

991
01:06:55,119 --> 01:06:57,280
It's going to be you
who gets in trouble.

992
01:07:01,599 --> 01:07:04,079
I'm sorry
for the misunderstanding then.

993
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:07,480
But I can confirm
Joy has never seduced him.

994
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:10,280
Double liars.

995
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:13,800
Ugh, if she's not going to listen,
you can talk it out with her, Trai.

996
01:07:14,519 --> 01:07:16,199
Let's go, Joy. This is annoying.

997
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:17,920
- Ms. Nade!
- Please stop!

998
01:07:20,199 --> 01:07:21,760
Let's wait until you've calmed down.

999
01:07:22,159 --> 01:07:23,360
Then we can talk.

1000
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:35,440
Trai? Trai?

1001
01:07:36,639 --> 01:07:38,360
- Hey.
- What?

1002
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,519
Since when was he her boyfriend?

1003
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,400
Right?

1004
01:07:42,880 --> 01:07:45,480
That explains why
she's pampering him so much.

1005
01:07:45,559 --> 01:07:47,320
Pampering?

1006
01:07:47,559 --> 01:07:48,760
Do you mind telling me?

1007
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:52,280
Well,

1008
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,239
busybody!

1009
01:07:59,639 --> 01:08:02,199
What's all the ruckus?
What happened?

1010
01:08:07,360 --> 01:08:10,039
Whoa. Oh!

1011
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,400
What happened to your face?

1012
01:08:32,479 --> 01:08:34,880
- Well, I love you.
- Nade!

1013
01:08:34,960 --> 01:08:37,239
Prove to me.
Cut yourself in the wrist!

1014
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:38,529
Ms. Nade, don't do it.

1015
01:08:38,609 --> 01:08:40,760
You cannot ruin my hard work

1016
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:44,279
by falling in love
with the servant's nephew.

1017
01:08:44,319 --> 01:08:46,960
Everyone, I'm going
to hit on this woman.

1018
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:48,569
Put me down!

1019
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:51,239
You want to know
Madame Nuan's secret, don't you?

1020
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,720
It's a special gift
I prepared specifically for you.

1021
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,760
Pa's going to expose
your mother's secret.

1022
01:08:56,800 --> 01:08:57,840
What secret?

1023
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,119
Let's find out together

1024
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:02,479
what this special gift

1025
01:09:02,569 --> 01:09:03,649
is.
