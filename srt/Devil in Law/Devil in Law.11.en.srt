1
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:38,000
I'm going to move forward
and try to win Pa's heart.

2
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,240
You don't have my permission!

3
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:40,719
You will defeat Nai!

4
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,319
- What's this for?
- Break up with my son.

5
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,280
Don't stay here
and let me hate your guts.

6
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,599
I'd like you to be prepared

7
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,719
because I'm going to convince
everyone to leave you soon.

8
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Then that's great.

9
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,439
Today, I've just received assurance

10
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:58,560
that Madame never sees
anyone's worth,

11
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,120
whether Nai or you.

12
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:03,560
But if I tell Mom about you,

13
00:03:03,639 --> 00:03:05,840
she's going to see more of my worth.

14
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:07,159
Go and get Nade.

15
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,199
- Yes, Madame.
- Yes, Madame.

16
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,599
Mom, I have something to tell you.

17
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:22,439
Mom, what happened to your face?

18
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:31,039
Why did you slap me?

19
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,599
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from Trai?

20
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:37,360
Why were you with him all night?

21
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,039
It's not what you think.

22
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,439
It's a misunderstanding.

23
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,560
I wasn't with him last night.

24
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:44,840
How stupid do you think I am?

25
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,960
How dare you lie to me!

26
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:51,759
Do you know

27
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,719
that your grandmother

28
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,280
started to hate me
after you were born?

29
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,319
I couldn't give her a grandson
as she wished.

30
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,159
I thought about getting an abortion,

31
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,840
but I couldn't go through with it

32
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:07,560
because you were still my baby.

33
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:11,520
If I had known you were
going to be so stubborn,

34
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,360
I would have gotten rid of you.

35
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,839
Let me tell you right now.

36
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,800
If Trai knocks you up,

37
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,879
there's no way
I'm letting you keep the baby.

38
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,519
But you wouldn't mind

39
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,240
if one of the rich men
you found me knocked me up,

40
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,480
would you?

41
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,680
I never thought

42
00:04:43,439 --> 00:04:45,959
you would be like this.

43
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:48,839
Never.

44
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,519
Wait.

45
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,560
You said you had
something to tell me.

46
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,560
Never mind.

47
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,050
I forgot what I was going to say.

48
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,839
Are you crazy?

49
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,439
I wasn't with Ms. Nade last night.

50
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,560
Both of you didn't
come home last night.

51
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,319
Then you came home together.

52
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:18,199
I stayed over at my friend's place.

53
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,959
Then I came home at dawn.

54
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,839
Ms. Nade called Uncle Phol and asked
him to get her car from the bar

55
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,680
and pick her up
from Mr. Thom's house.

56
00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:26,160
I volunteered to go instead.

57
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,120
Yes, he's telling the truth.

58
00:06:28,439 --> 00:06:30,120
I'm his alibi.

59
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,959
I saw him this morning.

60
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,959
Both of you always wake up late.

61
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,160
- You never know who comes and goes.
- She's right.

62
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:43,199
Tom, what should we do? Madame Nuan
is probably punishing Ms. Nade.

63
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,319
What can you do?

64
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:47,519
You should tell
Madame Nuan the truth.

65
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,279
- What do we do?
- No, I'm scared.

66
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:53,120
I'm going to help Ms. Nade.

67
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,480
- Wait.
- Stop.

68
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,639
Those who are not involved
in this matter, stay here.

69
00:06:57,839 --> 00:06:59,079
Don't follow him.

70
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,600
You will only make things worse.

71
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
Madame is in a bad mood today.

72
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,199
You will get all of us in trouble.

73
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,720
Let's go.

74
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
What about us?

75
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,639
Madame, Ms. Nade is innocent.

76
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,360
Where's Ms. Nade?

77
00:07:22,839 --> 00:07:25,480
You barged in without knocking.
How rude of you.

78
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,279
Oops, I'm sorry. I forgot to knock.

79
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,279
May I come in, Madame?

80
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,079
I would never accept this kind
of person as my son-in-law.

81
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,199
Come in.

82
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,120
Madame, I want you to know

83
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,800
that it's a misunderstanding.

84
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,959
Ms. Nade and I
weren't together last night.

85
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,439
I went to get her car
in the morning.

86
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,360
Then picked her up from...

87
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,199
a friend's house.

88
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,519
What's the name of this friend?

89
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,560
It's Ms. Waen,

90
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:10,560
Madame Soithong's daughter.

91
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,360
Ms. Nade already told me in advance,
but I forgot to notify you

92
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:17,720
since you were busy at
the Strong Woman Award ceremony.

93
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:19,160
I forgot to mention it.

94
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,079
Is that so?

95
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,600
It's true.

96
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,680
Ms. Nade and I
didn't spend the night together.

97
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,240
Get out.

98
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,799
Yes.

99
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,039
Madame.

100
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,759
You've already punished
Ms. Nade for it, haven't you?

101
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:50,759
Why don't I go get Ms. Nade
so you can apologize to her?

102
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,519
She must be really confused.

103
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,960
No.

104
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,090
An idiot like her is going to forget
about it in no time.

105
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
Yes, Madame.

106
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,559
What is it?

107
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,720
Ms. Nade.

108
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,759
I'm sorry for thinking
that you were with Trai

109
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,519
last night.

110
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,360
Trai has already told
Madame the truth.

111
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,720
Really?

112
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,759
What did my mother say?

113
00:10:05,879 --> 00:10:09,519
Well, Tom asked Madame
to apologize to you.

114
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,240
But Madame said

115
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,480
to leave you be

116
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,090
since an idiot like you is going
to forget about it in no time.

117
00:10:16,279 --> 00:10:19,039
Madame said those words, not me.

118
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,960
I see. You can leave now.

119
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,330
What?

120
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,720
Why did you tell her that?

121
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,090
Well, she asked.

122
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,879
I think the best thing for you
is to work with us.

123
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,679
Help us change her mindset

124
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,159
because if she sees
other people's worth more,

125
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,159
your life is going to
be happier as well.

126
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,480
Hello.

127
00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:24,679
May I speak to Pawinee?

128
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:26,480
She's listening.

129
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,240
Hello.

130
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,159
You promised to change
my mother's mindset, didn't you?

131
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,919
Yes.

132
00:11:34,159 --> 00:11:36,759
I promise to change
your mother's mindset

133
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,759
and help you and Trai be together.

134
00:11:45,039 --> 00:11:46,039
All right then.

135
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,799
Let's work together.

136
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:51,879
Thank you for trusting me.

137
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,960
I told you

138
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,200
that your sister was going
to be on our side.

139
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:13,919
What made you so sure that
Nade was going to change her mind?

140
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:18,759
Well, Nade came home with Trai
after being away all night.

141
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,720
Did you think
your mother would let it go?

142
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:30,039
You have to help me turn your mother
into a better person too.

143
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:34,080
Do it for Nick's mental health.

144
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Sure.

145
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,120
By the way,
where do you want me to take you?

146
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,679
First of all,
I have to punish a traitor.

147
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,559
Pa, don't do this.

148
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,840
No, stop it.

149
00:12:57,919 --> 00:13:01,240
Tell me why you betrayed me.

150
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,480
No.

151
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:04,440
You won't say it, will you?

152
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,519
Don't do this.

153
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:10,600
Stop it.

154
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,759
Thom, help me.

155
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,440
You crazy kid.

156
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,720
Stop!

157
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,919
Don't help him, Thom.

158
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,320
You are partly at fault too

159
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:25,039
for working with my father
to betray me.

160
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,399
Don't move.

161
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,399
Tell me what you want me to do.

162
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,919
I'm always on your side.

163
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,440
Are you going to tell me?

164
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,480
- No.
- Are you going to tell me?

165
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,919
No, don't do this.

166
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,519
- You won't say it, will you?
- Stop.

167
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,840
- Pa.
- Are you going to tell me?

168
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:54,000
Are you sure you won't say it?

169
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,519
Pa, that's enough.

170
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,159
Enough. I'll tell you.

171
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,320
I'll tell you.

172
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,559
Are you sure?

173
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:02,960
I'll tell you.

174
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,960
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

175
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,679
Thom, help me.

176
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:11,799
I'll tell you.

177
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,919
Nai, I need a hand.

178
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,399
I'm exhausted.

179
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,240
Pa, stop joking around.

180
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,240
- Don't do anything funny.
- I won't.

181
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,519
I did what I did

182
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,840
because Nai said he was going
to make you fall for him

183
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:46,360
and voluntarily stay married to him.

184
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,759
That's why I wanted
to break you two up.

185
00:14:49,919 --> 00:14:51,200
Come on, Dad.

186
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:54,120
Nai might not be able
to win my heart.

187
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:56,679
Who are you kidding?

188
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:59,679
He hasn't started hitting on you,
and you are already falling for him.

189
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:01,639
Once he hits on you,

190
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:02,919
you are going to fall for him.

191
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,879
Do you dare to swear again
that you won't fall for him?

192
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,320
Swear to Da's picture.

193
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,559
I'll take out a picture of
your mother too. What do you say?

194
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:12,360
Dad, is all of this
really necessary?

195
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,480
I knew it.

196
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,480
See? You are afraid to swear it.

197
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,320
You know you are going
to fall for him.

198
00:15:19,399 --> 00:15:21,120
I told you

199
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,279
that I don't want my girls to share
a husband, but you wouldn't listen.

200
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:26,919
You are just like your sister.

201
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,759
You choose men over me.

202
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,159
Fine.

203
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,519
If that will make you happy,
then I swear...

204
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,639
Wait. Listen.

205
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:42,799
Don't say things you don't mean.

206
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,159
Pa might really feel that way.

207
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,200
You know that I'm right.

208
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:54,799
Father.

209
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,919
You know how much Pa loves you.

210
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,120
Even if she already
had feelings for me,

211
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,399
she would still choose you over me.

212
00:16:06,279 --> 00:16:07,679
Back off then.

213
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,879
I can't do that.
I don't want to lose her either.

214
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
How about this?

215
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,080
I'm going to win Pa's heart...

216
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,279
And?

217
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:27,960
in two days.

218
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,279
What can you do in two days?

219
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,919
If I can't make Pa say

220
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:37,879
she loves me in two days,

221
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,080
I'll walk out of your lives.

222
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,360
But if I can do it,

223
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,960
you have to accept me
as your son-in-law.

224
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,759
All right then.

225
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:55,080
I'm a man of my word.

226
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,720
It's a deal.

227
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,639
It's a deal.

228
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:29,119
Have you got any updates on her yet?

229
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,240
Really?

230
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:45,890
Why won't Nade pick up?

231
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,920
Nade, please answer my call.

232
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,720
We need to sort things out.

233
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Hello.

234
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,599
Tin, I have to take your father
to the doctor in two days.

235
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,960
Don't forget to transfer me money.

236
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,200
I won't, Mom.

237
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,279
Hello.

238
00:18:31,599 --> 00:18:33,839
Please wait a second.

239
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,839
- Ma'am, hello.
- Hello.

240
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,519
Are you Mr. Dumkerng's relative?

241
00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,170
Dum is my husband.

242
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:43,839
He's over there.

243
00:18:46,039 --> 00:18:48,759
I'm looking for a hit-and-run victim
from eight years ago.

244
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:50,680
The driver was a woman.

245
00:18:50,759 --> 00:18:54,279
The clues we have make us believe
the victim was Mr. Dumkerng.

246
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:02,359
Nai.

247
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:06,960
What are you planning to do?

248
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:12,000
What makes you so sure that
you can win my heart in two days?

249
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,039
Let's keep it a surprise.

250
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:17,319
No matter what you do,
it's not going to work.

251
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,519
I have no choice
but to choose my father.

252
00:19:20,079 --> 00:19:21,599
You don't need to choose anyone.

253
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,119
You and I can work together

254
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,920
to make your father
and my mother accept our love.

255
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:30,119
But before we can do that,

256
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,410
I have to make you fall
head over heels for me first.

257
00:19:34,039 --> 00:19:36,279
That way, we can both
fight for our love.

258
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:41,000
But you only have two days.

259
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:44,359
How are you going to make me forget

260
00:19:44,759 --> 00:19:46,720
that you were my sister's husband

261
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,839
and the son of the woman
who left her to die?

262
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:55,319
You'll find out when the time comes.

263
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:02,650
Can you do it?

264
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:04,920
- All done.
- Good.

265
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,680
Ms. Nade.

266
00:20:32,319 --> 00:20:35,680
Hey, it's a bad omen
to knock on your plate.

267
00:20:38,359 --> 00:20:40,359
- You have no manners.
- I'm back.

268
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,480
I'm back.

269
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:44,000
- Join us for dinner.
- What do we have here?

270
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,359
We have a lot of food.

271
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,920
- Everything looks delicious.
- Yes.

272
00:20:49,079 --> 00:20:51,319
- Do both of you want to eat now?
- Yes.

273
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,759
- Take this then.
- Thank you.

274
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,920
- Let me get you some rice.
- The omelet looks amazing.

275
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:02,960
What's wrong?

276
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,319
You look heartbroken.

277
00:21:05,119 --> 00:21:06,200
Being heartbroken

278
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:09,480
is better than being
in an ambiguous relationship.

279
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,519
Get your own rice then.

280
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:17,839
What is this?

281
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:20,650
Don't act like a child.

282
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,559
What's going on?

283
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,559
I'm confused too.

284
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:25,960
Let's dig in.

285
00:21:26,519 --> 00:21:27,960
Hold on.

286
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:30,920
- Wait for Trai first.
- He's not eating.

287
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,519
I'm starting now.

288
00:21:33,839 --> 00:21:36,119
You should eat a lot of this.
It makes you smarter.

289
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,440
You should eat a lot too.
You look like a stick.

290
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,440
- Oh.
- Listen to you all.

291
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,319
The stir-fried garlic chives dish
is so good.

292
00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:45,559
Ms. Nade cooked it, not me.

293
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,440
- Really?
- What did you say?

294
00:21:48,519 --> 00:21:49,559
Who did you say cooked it again?

295
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,480
It was Ms. Nade's first time
in the kitchen,

296
00:21:53,559 --> 00:21:55,480
but she tried really hard.

297
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,319
The food turned out really well.

298
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,160
- Is it that delicious? Let me try.
- Yes.

299
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,559
Wait.

300
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,599
He's taking photos of it.

301
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,359
He said

302
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,440
he wasn't hungry.

303
00:22:11,519 --> 00:22:15,039
He looked really down just now.

304
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:16,640
What's going on with him?

305
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,079
I don't know.

306
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:22,799
- What? He's taking selfies with it.
- What?

307
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,559
Are you an influencer?

308
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,799
He's keeping it all for himself.

309
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:36,680
- Oh my...
- Oh my...

310
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,640
Is it that delicious?

311
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:43,440
Look at him.

312
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,279
Eat slowly.

313
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,640
It's the tastiest stir-fried
garlic chives in the world.

314
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,960
I ate every bit of it, Ms. Nade.

315
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:22,519
I cooked it just for you.

316
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,240
I wanted to thank you
for telling my mother the truth

317
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:28,240
that we didn't spend
last night together.

318
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,039
Thank you.

319
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,599
You've been giving me
the cold shoulder

320
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:43,200
because your mother
doesn't approve of our love, right?

321
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,160
Yes.

322
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,599
We can't be more than friends.

323
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,720
No.

324
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:07,920
I'm going to prove to your mother

325
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:10,039
that my last name

326
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:11,759
suits you very well.

327
00:24:15,079 --> 00:24:18,480
It won't be easy
to get my mother's approval.

328
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:23,799
I don't care how difficult it is.

329
00:24:24,519 --> 00:24:27,279
I'm going to fight for you, the
woman who will share my last name.

330
00:24:30,599 --> 00:24:31,960
Gosh, Trai.

331
00:24:47,079 --> 00:24:49,519
Now that I think about it,

332
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:53,200
you haven't told me
your last name before.

333
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:00,480
It's Haosamhon.

334
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,200
Seriously?

335
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,839
Nadedao Haosamhon.

336
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,279
You were right.
It suits me really well.

337
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:57,680
Has Nai done anything
to win your heart?

338
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,160
Not yet.

339
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,640
It doesn't seem like
he's going to do anything.

340
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:07,440
He's been working really hard
and going to bed late at night.

341
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,599
I hear his company
is working on a new project.

342
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:12,839
He left for work
early this morning too.

343
00:26:13,839 --> 00:26:14,880
I see.

344
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,440
You will probably

345
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,839
have to help me

346
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:22,319
pack up my stuff in a day or two.

347
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,200
You don't think he's going
to make you fall for him in time?

348
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,240
No.

349
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,759
I can't think of anything

350
00:26:30,279 --> 00:26:34,440
that will make me fall
head over heels for him.

351
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,400
He only has one day left.

352
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,559
I think he can do it

353
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,720
if no one gets in his way.

354
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,079
Who's going to get in his way?

355
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,039
Your father.

356
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:49,799
Uncle Nit has been making it clear

357
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,440
that he won't let his girls
share a husband.

358
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,759
Do you think he's going to sit by

359
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,839
and let Nai win your heart?

360
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:06,839
Yes, that's good.

361
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,000
Wait by the fence.

362
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,759
Don't leave the item with anyone.

363
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,720
I'm on my way. See you.

364
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:15,680
- Where are you going?
- I need to get something.

365
00:27:28,599 --> 00:27:30,119
- Is it what I asked for?
- Yes.

366
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,880
But be careful with it
as it's life-threatening.

367
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,599
Yes, I know. You can leave now.

368
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,680
Yes, sir.

369
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,920
Holy...

370
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:41,839
Darn it, Pa.

371
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,079
Why are you standing there?
You scared me to death.

372
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,559
Gosh.

373
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,200
- What?
- What is that, Dad?

374
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,039
It's food.

375
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:52,160
What kind of food?

376
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,599
Why do you ask?

377
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:58,480
Well, I want to know what's inside.
He said it was life-threatening.

378
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,680
You heard that from over there?

379
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,880
Give it to me.

380
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,480
Dad!

381
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:13,519
It's a chicken.

382
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,200
And fish sauce.

383
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,599
Braised chicken in fish sauce?

384
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,240
Well, yes.

385
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:29,160
I didn't want you to know that
I ordered it from a friend's shop

386
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,599
because you want me to avoid sodium.

387
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,279
But I told my friend, Wang,
to cook me a low-sodium version.

388
00:28:35,359 --> 00:28:36,599
So he did.

389
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:38,920
I see.

390
00:28:40,119 --> 00:28:41,240
That's a relief.

391
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,480
What did you think it was?

392
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,440
Tell me.

393
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,839
Nothing, I don't know
what you are talking about.

394
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,160
- Pa, stop right there.
- What?

395
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:02,440
Tell me.

396
00:29:02,759 --> 00:29:05,240
What did you think
I was going to do?

397
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:08,359
I...

398
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,920
Lying to your parent is a big sin.

399
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,759
Your life won't prosper,
and you will end up as a failure.

400
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,160
That's enough, Dad.

401
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,839
Fine, I'll say it.

402
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,279
I was just afraid

403
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,640
you were going to prevent Nai

404
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,039
from fulfilling his deal with you.

405
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,440
Why would I waste my precious
chicking-eating time to do that?

406
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,480
He can't possibly convince you

407
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:38,000
to choose the man
responsible for Da's death

408
00:29:38,079 --> 00:29:42,720
over your father who practically
raised you. Am I right?

409
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:43,960
Am I right?

410
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,240
Well...

411
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,960
I can't answer you yet

412
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,279
since I don't even know
what he's planning to do.

413
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,359
Listen to me.

414
00:29:59,599 --> 00:30:01,759
No matter what Nai does,

415
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,559
you have to remember
the promise you gave me.

416
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,799
You only married Nai

417
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,880
to avenge Srikanda.

418
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,960
You said you would
never fall for him.

419
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:17,279
I hope you think about

420
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,720
your promise and my face

421
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:22,440
before you decide to do anything.
Do you understand?

422
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:27,880
Yes, Dad.

423
00:30:28,079 --> 00:30:30,720
All right. That's my girl.

424
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,640
Let's celebrate your upcoming
divorce with this braised chicken.

425
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,960
- Let's go.
- Dad, people might hear you.

426
00:30:39,079 --> 00:30:40,640
No one's around.

427
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,000
You are so paranoid.

428
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,359
It's better safe than sorry.

429
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,599
Where? I don't see anyone.

430
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,119
If anyone shows up,
I'll kick them in the face.

431
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,480
There's a lot of coconut meat.

432
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,599
- It's delicious.
- Right?

433
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:04,079
There was leftover jackfruit and
coconut milk from Madame's dessert.

434
00:31:04,319 --> 00:31:06,319
I used them
to make this dessert for you.

435
00:31:08,079 --> 00:31:09,720
Your desserts

436
00:31:09,839 --> 00:31:12,000
are the best.

437
00:31:12,759 --> 00:31:14,799
- My nephew's such a sweet talker.
- He's a sweet talker.

438
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,960
- My wife makes tasty desserts.
- I know what to say.

439
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:17,559
Yes. It's delicious.

440
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,119
- Really?
- Everyone,

441
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,680
- listen up.
- What?

442
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:22,240
I have news.

443
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:24,640
Ms. Pa only married Mr. Nai

444
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,799
to avenge Mrs. Da.

445
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,279
What?

446
00:31:35,599 --> 00:31:36,680
Look me in the eyes.

447
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:39,680
Both of you already knew about it,
didn't you?

448
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,880
And how do you know about this?

449
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,640
I was climbing the tree
to check on the bird's nest

450
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:48,880
when Grandpa and Ms. Pa
started talking under the tree.

451
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,160
This means

452
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:55,680
Ms. Pa and Mr. Nai
aren't really in love.

453
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,920
Auntie.

454
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,720
They are getting a divorce.

455
00:32:01,799 --> 00:32:02,960
- What?
- What?

456
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,319
Are you surprised or deaf?

457
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,559
I'm deaf.

458
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,799
They are getting a divorce.

459
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,240
Really?

460
00:32:09,319 --> 00:32:12,599
Without Ms. Pa, everything
in this house would be a mess.

461
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,200
- Exactly.
- Gosh.

462
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,160
Dao.

463
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,160
Tell us everything you know.

464
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,039
- Fine, here's the truth.
- Dao.

465
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:24,319
- What?
- Don't say it.

466
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,279
You are unbelievable.

467
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,079
Since Jai has already brought it up,

468
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,359
let me get it out of my chest.
It's killing me to keep it a secret.

469
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,440
Say it.

470
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:34,079
You can't tell anyone.

471
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,440
- I know.
- I know.

472
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,319
Here's the thing...

473
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,680
What is it, Trai?

474
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,319
I have news, Mr. Nai.

475
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,319
Jai and the others know
about your fake marriage.

476
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,680
Did Nade tell them?

477
00:32:55,759 --> 00:32:56,759
No.

478
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,599
Jai overheard
Pa's conversation with Grandpa.

479
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,680
I see.

480
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:02,559
Thank you for letting me know.

481
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,480
I have an important matter
to take care of first.

482
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:07,440
What is it?

483
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,640
Excuse me.

484
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,960
Mr. Noppanai is here to see you.

485
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:26,920
Hello, sir.

486
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,400
You could have called me.

487
00:33:32,759 --> 00:33:34,960
You didn't need to come in person.

488
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,880
This matter can't be discussed
over the phone.

489
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,480
- Take a seat.
- It's all right. I won't stay long.

490
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:43,799
I just have a question for you.

491
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,880
Why did you tell Pa
about my mother's secret?

492
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,240
Secret?

493
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:52,440
What secret?

494
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,960
- Madame had an affair?
- Madame had an affair?

495
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,319
Yes.

496
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:00,000
It happened a long time ago.

497
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,680
I was close with Krit,
Madame's husband.

498
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,960
Krit suspected
Madame was having an affair.

499
00:34:09,559 --> 00:34:11,360
He decided to follow her to a hotel.

500
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,079
Oh.

501
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:17,960
Her secret affair.

502
00:34:19,519 --> 00:34:21,480
Did you know about this?

503
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,119
Yes.

504
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,809
I've known for a long time.

505
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,559
But I never told anyone

506
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,719
because I didn't want
to hurt my mother.

507
00:34:31,289 --> 00:34:34,239
Wait, don't take it the wrong way.

508
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,599
I didn't mean your mother harm.

509
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,480
I was trying to help her.

510
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,289
Help her?

511
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,480
Yes.

512
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,519
Pa was asking me
about Madame's secret.

513
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,289
I had to tell her.
I don't know how to lie.

514
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
But I didn't tell her everything.

515
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,559
I only told her
about the secret affair.

516
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,000
It was a personal problem
that happened a long time ago.

517
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:05,440
If Pa had used it to expose Madame,

518
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,840
Madame would have been able
to talk herself out of it.

519
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,809
But if I hadn't said anything

520
00:35:10,289 --> 00:35:12,679
and Pa had found the whole truth

521
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,599
by herself,

522
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,079
Madame's life
would have been ruined.

523
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,159
The whole truth?

524
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,840
What do you mean by that?

525
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,079
I guess you don't know
the whole story.

526
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,880
Here's the truth.

527
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:35,679
Madame used to
trade her body for work.

528
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,599
If people find out about this,

529
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,719
Madame will be the talk of the town.

530
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,400
People were questioning

531
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,769
why companies that hired her
as a consultant

532
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,039
always landed big projects.

533
00:35:47,639 --> 00:35:49,960
Do you have proof
to support your accusation?

534
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,159
Your father's death is proof.

535
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,000
Krit, your father, wasn't the type

536
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:07,159
to die of a broken heart after being
cheated on once by his wife.

537
00:36:07,719 --> 00:36:09,440
He died because he knew

538
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,400
that his company
only landed big projects

539
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,679
due to...

540
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,599
his wife's expertise.

541
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:26,289
Do you understand
why I did what I did now?

542
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:30,440
Why don't we grab some lunch?

543
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:32,599
I'll ask Lita to come with us.

544
00:36:34,199 --> 00:36:36,769
Don't bother trying
to set me and Lita up.

545
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,719
I would never start
a family with Lita.

546
00:36:42,719 --> 00:36:44,159
What do you have against her?

547
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,719
It's not her.

548
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,769
It's you.

549
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,289
What kind of father

550
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,329
encourages his daughter
to throw herself at a married man?

551
00:36:56,809 --> 00:36:58,239
Don't cross the line, Nai.

552
00:36:58,329 --> 00:37:00,400
What you did to my mother

553
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,289
is much worse.

554
00:37:03,809 --> 00:37:07,559
Think about the damage you would
have caused my family

555
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:10,400
if Pa hadn't come to her senses.

556
00:37:11,159 --> 00:37:13,079
And don't say you did it

557
00:37:13,559 --> 00:37:15,239
to help my mother.

558
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,920
I'm not an idiot.

559
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,039
As for my mother's past,

560
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,809
I don't care
whether it's true or not.

561
00:37:28,159 --> 00:37:29,920
The past is behind us.

562
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:33,039
I live in the present.

563
00:37:34,199 --> 00:37:36,119
And now I realize

564
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:40,039
who's always out to get my family.

565
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:47,239
Don't use my wife
to hurt my mother again.

566
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,039
What are you going to do about it?

567
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,840
I will do whatever it takes

568
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:55,840
to protect my family.

569
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:16,920
Hey, I took you shopping

570
00:38:17,039 --> 00:38:20,719
to get your mind off Nai's plan.

571
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,519
Please work with me here, girl.

572
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,360
Fine.

573
00:38:26,719 --> 00:38:29,079
I'll leave my phone with you

574
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:32,559
so we can enjoy our time together.

575
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,840
It's Nai.

576
00:38:42,809 --> 00:38:44,199
Hello.

577
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:46,239
Let's have dinner together, Pa.

578
00:38:46,719 --> 00:38:47,719
Hold on.

579
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:51,639
Why are you suddenly asking me out?

580
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:53,840
I want to spend time
with the person I love.

581
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:59,000
This isn't part of the plan
to win my heart, is it?

582
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:00,079
No.

583
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,960
It's still too soon for that.

584
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,119
I'll pick you up at 6 p.m.

585
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:09,329
No, it's fine, Nai.

586
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,400
I'm outside with Joy right now.

587
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,360
She can drop me off.

588
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:18,039
Please send me the location
of the restaurant.

589
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:19,809
- Wait, Pa.
- Yes?

590
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,679
Do you know what I wish
I was doing right now?

591
00:39:23,639 --> 00:39:24,880
I wish I was hugging you.

592
00:39:32,599 --> 00:39:34,000
Keep it down.

593
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,840
My mind is troubled right now.

594
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,480
Hugging you would make it go away.

595
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:46,039
What's bothering you?

596
00:39:46,119 --> 00:39:48,119
We can talk about it later tonight.

597
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:49,960
Okay.

598
00:39:59,519 --> 00:40:01,039
What's with you?

599
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:06,039
I bet he's going
to surprise you tonight

600
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:08,840
and ask you to accept his love.

601
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,809
He said this isn't part of the plan.
He doesn't lie.

602
00:40:13,639 --> 00:40:16,159
Listen, we don't know
what's going to happen,

603
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,199
but we have to be prepared.

604
00:40:19,199 --> 00:40:20,769
Look, there's still time.

605
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,920
Let's do this.

606
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,119
Wait. Hey.

607
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:25,199
Where are you taking me?

608
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:27,559
Well, you need a makeover.

609
00:40:27,809 --> 00:40:30,329
- Let's go. Come on. I'm serious.
- I don't need a makeover.

610
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:07,719
Pa.

611
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:12,809
- Where's Joy?
- She left.

612
00:41:19,159 --> 00:41:20,440
You look beautiful today.

613
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:25,880
- Wait, Pa.
- What?

614
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,079
Come sit here.

615
00:41:30,519 --> 00:41:32,719
Why are there three seats?

616
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,599
Who else did you invite?

617
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,440
Listen.

618
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:44,679
I invited...

619
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,840
Sorry, I'm late.

620
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,480
Pawinee?

621
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:58,639
You should have told me

622
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,679
that a certain person would be here.

623
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,769
I need time to make peace with it.

624
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,159
I agree.

625
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:05,679
You should have told me.

626
00:42:05,769 --> 00:42:07,400
You didn't know either?

627
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,559
I wouldn't have come if I did.

628
00:42:09,639 --> 00:42:10,880
Nai.

629
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,199
Why are you doing this?

630
00:42:12,769 --> 00:42:13,769
Calm down.

631
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:17,769
Let's eat first. Then we can talk.

632
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,880
- No.
- No.

633
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:21,769
Unless I know why we are here,

634
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,000
I won't have an appetite
to eat anything.

635
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,559
Tell me why we are here.

636
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:28,400
Otherwise, I'm leaving.

637
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:29,480
Okay.

638
00:42:30,199 --> 00:42:31,360
Fine.

639
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:50,289
I invited you and Pa out today

640
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,880
because I want to tell you...

641
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,639
the reason Pa and I got married
right after Da passed away.

642
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:08,599
I wanted to prove to Pa

643
00:43:09,239 --> 00:43:11,639
that you didn't leave Da
to die on purpose.

644
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,880
Nai.

645
00:43:20,519 --> 00:43:23,199
I'm sorry
I didn't tell you about this.

646
00:43:24,159 --> 00:43:25,679
I was afraid you'd stop me.

647
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:30,719
I decided it was better to tell
my mother the truth

648
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:33,239
than let her hear it from elsewhere.

649
00:43:33,329 --> 00:43:34,809
Things would get out of hand.

650
00:43:40,559 --> 00:43:41,880
I knew

651
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,760
something was up

652
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,119
with your marriage.

653
00:43:48,679 --> 00:43:49,880
So?

654
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,400
Does this answer your question

655
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,840
of whether or not
I killed your sister?

656
00:43:56,239 --> 00:43:57,239
No.

657
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,760
It doesn't.

658
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,960
Then what must I do
for you to believe me

659
00:44:04,639 --> 00:44:06,719
and divorce my son?

660
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,079
I'm not divorcing her.

661
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,719
It's true Pa and I
didn't get married out of love.

662
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:20,880
But time

663
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,599
has made me love her more and more.

664
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,800
Even if Pa believes that you didn't
kill Da on purpose,

665
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,840
she's still going to stay with me

666
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:40,119
as my wife for the rest of her life.

667
00:44:49,679 --> 00:44:50,719
Mom.

668
00:45:00,039 --> 00:45:01,039
Pa.

669
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:02,920
I need to talk to my mother.

670
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,760
Sure.

671
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:37,480
Stop the car.

672
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:39,960
What? You want me
to stop the car here?

673
00:45:40,039 --> 00:45:41,800
I said stop the car!

674
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:43,800
Yes.

675
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,519
- Madame...
- Get out.

676
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:52,719
What?

677
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,239
I said get out.

678
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,840
Yes.

679
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:38,280
Here's the quote
we are posting tomorrow.

680
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:39,840
"Problems don't lead you
to a dead end"

681
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:42,400
"but push you to find a new route."

682
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:45,039
"Written by Madame Nuan."

683
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,960
Are you dying to be
my daughter-in-law, Pawinee?

684
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,199
How did it go?

685
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:02,679
She's gone.

686
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:06,320
I'll talk to her at home.

687
00:47:13,639 --> 00:47:15,280
That's a good idea.

688
00:47:16,239 --> 00:47:17,920
I think she's really upset.

689
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,480
It's a good idea
to give her some time.

690
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,519
Are you saying I need time to accept
my talented daughter-in-law?

691
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:31,960
I don't need time.

692
00:47:40,519 --> 00:47:41,559
Excuse me.

693
00:47:42,039 --> 00:47:43,400
Can I have the menu?

694
00:47:48,519 --> 00:47:50,400
I told Phol to go home first.

695
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:52,440
I'm going home with you

696
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:56,480
and my new daughter-in-law.

697
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,079
What's with the faces?

698
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,280
Don't you trust me?

699
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,960
You were upset just now.

700
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,519
Yes, I was upset.

701
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,199
However,

702
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,880
I've realized

703
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:35,039
that I love you

704
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,440
and want you to be happy.

705
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:42,239
And if you want me to accept Pawinee
as my daughter-in-law,

706
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:45,880
I'll open up my heart for her

707
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:49,159
since I want you to be happy.

708
00:48:56,519 --> 00:48:58,280
I can do anything for you.

709
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:01,599
I can reach
for the moon and the stars,

710
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:03,559
or even dance for you right now

711
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:05,239
if that's what you want.

712
00:49:09,039 --> 00:49:10,320
That's a good idea.

713
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,239
I kind of want to see you dance.

714
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:24,840
Let's do that, Mom.

715
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,639
I want to see you dance too.

716
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,320
I'll turn on some music for you.

717
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,719
That's enough, Mom.

718
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:27,840
I believe you now
that you would do anything for me.

719
00:50:30,119 --> 00:50:31,360
I love you.

720
00:50:35,159 --> 00:50:36,599
I love you too.

721
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:38,440
From now on,

722
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,760
we are not going to lie
to each other.

723
00:50:43,239 --> 00:50:44,239
Yes, Mom.

724
00:51:16,679 --> 00:51:17,840
Go sit in the back.

725
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:19,559
I want to sit with my son.

726
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,480
You sit in the back.

727
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,440
I want to sit with my husband.

728
00:51:28,599 --> 00:51:31,679
I have long legs. It's uncomfortable
to sit in the backseat.

729
00:51:32,239 --> 00:51:33,559
I'll adjust my seat for you.

730
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:40,920
Nai.

731
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:42,559
Nai.

732
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,159
Hey.

733
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:51,280
- What's your problem?
- What's yours?

734
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,360
That's enough.

735
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,719
- Why are you smiling?
- Why are you smiling?

736
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,840
Da.

737
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,840
Why are you crying?

738
00:53:03,159 --> 00:53:04,440
Don't cry.

739
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,920
I promise

740
00:53:09,639 --> 00:53:11,280
that I will do everything

741
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,039
to get between Pa and Nai.

742
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:16,800
Don't cry.

743
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,639
Don't cry.

744
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:28,239
I promise you.

745
00:53:41,880 --> 00:53:43,239
I promise.

746
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,960
I promise, Da.

747
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:49,199
I promise.

748
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:50,960
Sir.

749
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:52,719
Sir.

750
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,119
Sir!

751
00:53:57,519 --> 00:53:58,519
Sir.

752
00:54:09,519 --> 00:54:10,960
What are you doing here?

753
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,960
You asked me to wake you up
when Mr. Nai and Ms. Pa return.

754
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:15,760
They are back.

755
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,920
Did you have a nightmare?

756
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,400
Grandpa.

757
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,320
What's wrong?

758
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:30,920
Wait...

759
00:54:33,719 --> 00:54:35,239
I guess I got up too quickly.

760
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:36,920
Calm down.

761
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,400
Okay.

762
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:42,679
Calm down.

763
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,880
Madame Nuan only pretended
to accept me.

764
00:54:57,519 --> 00:54:58,519
I know.

765
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,400
Then why did you let her
put on an act?

766
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:08,159
Isn't this better than her being mad
and staying away from us?

767
00:55:08,719 --> 00:55:09,800
Spending time together

768
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,400
will give you two a chance to
get to know and love each other.

769
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,960
Like what happened to us.

770
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,320
Be prepared to say
that you love me tomorrow.

771
00:55:23,599 --> 00:55:25,519
And I'll finally get to do
what I want to do.

772
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:31,159
Or do I have your permission
to do it right here right now?

773
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:44,880
Son of a biscuit.

774
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,199
Did you just insult me?

775
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,280
I...

776
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,559
I didn't.

777
00:55:49,639 --> 00:55:52,000
But my father
is standing right there.

778
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:53,480
- Your father?
- Yes.

779
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,480
Look.

780
00:56:08,199 --> 00:56:09,480
Go to bed.

781
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:11,880
I need to talk to Nai.

782
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:14,400
About what?

783
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,159
Stay out of it.

784
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:19,199
We have to talk man-to-man.

785
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:24,599
Go.

786
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,639
Go.

787
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:47,639
Here.

788
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,440
Sign it.

789
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,199
What is it?

790
00:56:54,360 --> 00:56:56,400
A contract between true men.

791
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,360
If you can't get Pa to admit
that she loves you

792
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:02,800
by 3 p.m. tomorrow,

793
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,199
you have to divorce her immediately.

794
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,320
Otherwise, you will be
violating the contract

795
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:12,079
and will have to
make up for it by...

796
00:57:12,159 --> 00:57:14,360
Wow, that was fast.

797
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,960
Aren't you going to read
the conditions if you fail?

798
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:19,519
No.

799
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:21,440
I'm sure I can do it.

800
00:57:22,519 --> 00:57:24,119
Dang, that confidence.

801
00:57:24,199 --> 00:57:26,000
Are we done here?

802
00:57:26,119 --> 00:57:27,480
Excuse me then.

803
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:03,599
If I can't make Pa say

804
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,519
that she loves me in two days,

805
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,760
I'll walk out of your lives.

806
00:58:11,719 --> 00:58:13,039
But if I can do it,

807
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:16,599
you have to accept me
as your son-in-law.

808
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:19,239
But before we can do that,

809
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,519
I have to make you fall
head over heels for me first.

810
00:58:23,159 --> 00:58:25,960
That way, we can both
fight for our love.

811
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:30,920
Uncle.

812
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,639
What do you think Nai's going to do?

813
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:35,840
Why is he so sure that he can win
Pa's heart in two days?

814
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,480
I don't care what he's going to do.

815
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,719
I'm going to stop him anyway.

816
00:58:45,039 --> 00:58:46,199
What are you going to do?

817
00:58:48,039 --> 00:58:49,039
Come here.

818
00:58:52,559 --> 00:58:54,280
I'm going to drug him.

819
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:56,039
- No!
- What? Keep it down.

820
00:58:56,119 --> 00:58:57,480
You can't do that.

821
00:58:57,599 --> 00:58:59,400
That's cheating.

822
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,639
We have to play fair and square.

823
00:59:02,679 --> 00:59:04,000
I wouldn't mind

824
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:07,159
getting blood on my hands
if it would save Pa...

825
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:11,519
from being Madame's daughter-in-law
for the rest of her life.

826
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,960
Give it to me.

827
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:16,519
Dad!

828
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:23,519
And fish sauce.

829
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:25,760
Braised chicken in fish sauce?

830
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,159
Well, yes.

831
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:30,480
I didn't want you to know that
I ordered it from a friend's shop.

832
00:59:46,239 --> 00:59:47,880
Thank goodness Pa didn't find it.

833
01:00:10,719 --> 01:00:12,039
How's it going, Father?

834
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,000
Will you be able to sleep

835
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:16,800
if you drink coffee before bed?

836
01:00:17,559 --> 01:00:21,119
I only drink coffee when I have
to stay up late for work.

837
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:37,920
Don't you usually add syrup
in your coffee?

838
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:39,440
Pour it in.

839
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,599
I've changed my mind.

840
01:00:43,599 --> 01:00:45,719
I'll finish my work tomorrow.
I'll head straight to bed tonight.

841
01:00:46,280 --> 01:00:48,480
But you should drink it first.

842
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:51,000
- Don't waste it.
- It's fine.

843
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:53,320
What a waste. Drink it.

844
01:00:56,239 --> 01:00:57,239
Wait.

845
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,320
You already made the coffee.
Drink it.

846
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:31,599
Goodnight, Father.

847
01:01:40,360 --> 01:01:43,119
Did you think you were a step
ahead of me, Nai?

848
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,599
You should have drunk the coffee,

849
01:02:18,079 --> 01:02:19,920
but you chose to drink the water.

850
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:24,480
Wow.

851
01:02:49,719 --> 01:02:52,400
- Ma'am, I'm glad to run into you.
- Hello.

852
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:53,639
Here.

853
01:02:54,119 --> 01:02:56,199
It's your pay
for last week's cleaning service.

854
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,239
- Thank you.
- You are welcome.

855
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:00,440
By the way, Thom,

856
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:03,920
I found this necklace in your
bedroom while I was cleaning.

857
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:05,440
Here it is.

858
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:09,920
- I'll get going then.
- Okay.

859
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:11,000
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

860
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:37,079
Thank you.

861
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:44,320
Where's my father?

862
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:46,679
He went out for dinner
with his friends.

863
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:49,440
Would you like anything else?

864
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:53,639
Please give me one more glass
of orange juice then.

865
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:56,360
I'm exhausted from meeting
with clients all day.

866
01:03:57,199 --> 01:03:58,199
You got it.

867
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:18,960
Give me your address.

868
01:04:19,039 --> 01:04:21,159
I'll stop by
to return your necklace.

869
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:26,280
I left it there yesterday.
You took forever to find it.

870
01:04:36,039 --> 01:04:37,599
I'm going outside.

871
01:04:37,719 --> 01:04:39,400
What? I thought you were tired.

872
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:40,840
Not anymore.

873
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:52,119
Hey.

874
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:57,039
I was nearby when you texted me,

875
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:58,800
so I came to get it myself.

876
01:06:05,039 --> 01:06:06,039
Hey!

877
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,159
I drove all the way here.

878
01:06:08,239 --> 01:06:10,400
Aren't you going to say something?

879
01:06:12,199 --> 01:06:14,519
Well, I don't know what to say.

880
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:18,159
I'm sleepy.

881
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,920
I should head to bed.

882
01:06:20,119 --> 01:06:21,159
Wait.

883
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,519
I know you are mad at me

884
01:06:24,519 --> 01:06:26,920
for causing a misunderstanding
about a crook.

885
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,239
Please forget about it.

886
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,519
What you did yesterday

887
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:37,039
was really sweet. Do you know that?

888
01:06:39,679 --> 01:06:41,079
I'm serious.

889
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:48,000
Just stop talking.

890
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:50,599
You look so innocent,

891
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:52,880
but you can't be trusted at all.

892
01:06:54,519 --> 01:06:55,559
I'm sorry.

893
01:06:56,039 --> 01:06:59,360
But I can't believe anything
you say anymore.

894
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:04,320
Wait, Thom.

895
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:06,280
Thom.

896
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:18,320
I won't give up.

897
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:29,559
Nai.

898
01:07:51,760 --> 01:07:52,760
Nai.

899
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:11,960
Nai.

900
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:14,039
Nai.

901
01:08:17,439 --> 01:08:19,239
Enjoy your sleep, Nai.

902
01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:25,239
Goodnight.

903
01:08:50,479 --> 01:08:51,479
Nai.

904
01:08:52,760 --> 01:08:53,760
Mom!

905
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,239
Is Mom all right?

906
01:08:58,279 --> 01:09:00,359
I want to know
what they were talking about.

907
01:09:00,439 --> 01:09:03,680
Uncle, Nai asked Pa
to meet at your house.

908
01:09:03,760 --> 01:09:06,609
You have to take care
of this for me then, Thom.

909
01:09:06,680 --> 01:09:09,199
Everything has to stop
when the clock strikes three.

910
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:10,760
Understood?

911
01:09:12,609 --> 01:09:14,399
Between the woman
who does a stupid thing,

912
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:17,649
marrying the husband
of her own sister

913
01:09:17,649 --> 01:09:19,529
to take revenge on your mother,

914
01:09:19,529 --> 01:09:20,569
and me,

915
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:23,119
who willingly sacrificed so much,

916
01:09:24,079 --> 01:09:25,359
who do you choose?
