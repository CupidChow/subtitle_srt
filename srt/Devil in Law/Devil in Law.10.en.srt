1
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,000
But I love you.

2
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,159
You cannot ruin my hard work

3
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:42,479
by falling in love
with the servant's nephew.

4
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,080
You want to know
Madame's secret, don't you?

5
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,319
Pa's going to expose
your mother's secret.

6
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,439
Let's find out together

7
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:53,280
what this special gift is.

8
00:02:53,919 --> 00:02:57,439
I bought you a diamond necklace.

9
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,120
It's really touching.

10
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,199
Thank you very much
for not destroying my family.

11
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,159
I'm going to hit on this woman.

12
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:38,120
Are you going
somewhere else afterward?

13
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,730
I've arrived.

14
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:32,730
(I've arrived.)

15
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:34,000
Where are you, Ms. Nade?

16
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,560
(Where are you, Ms. Nade?)

17
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,170
Hello?

18
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,399
(Hello?)

19
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,730
(Trai)

20
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,079
From now on, it's your job

21
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,170
to get Trai out of your life.

22
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,680
If you don't do it,

23
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,120
don't expect to see his face again.

24
00:05:29,439 --> 00:05:31,920
(Trai)

25
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,000
You have reached the voicemail...

26
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,639
(Big Surprise
from Madame Nuan's Daughter-In-Law)

27
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,759
(The News to End All News
About the Rift Between the In-Laws)

28
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:31,839
Madame Nuan's
daughter-in-law looks familiar.

29
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,079
Where have I seen her?

30
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,639
It'd be so nice

31
00:06:47,079 --> 00:06:49,480
if I got to stand there

32
00:06:50,399 --> 00:06:51,639
as Madame Nuan's son-in-law.

33
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,720
Hello,

34
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,519
Nadedao.

35
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:29,399
(Hello, Nadedao. I am Tin.)

36
00:07:31,879 --> 00:07:32,879
(Hello, Nadedao. I am Tin.)

37
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,000
(Tin)

38
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:03,120
From now on,
I'll drive you around, Pa.

39
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:31,519
Yes?

40
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:33,919
I came to see if you're okay.

41
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,360
Why didn't you read my text?

42
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,330
I just got out of the shower.

43
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,879
So are you going to
let me be your driver?

44
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,450
Can I even stop you?

45
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,759
I won't disturb you anymore.

46
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,210
What are you doing?

47
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,519
Giving you a goodnight kiss.

48
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,519
Dad might wake up.

49
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,279
I don't think he's going to.

50
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,480
That was nice.

51
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,159
You can let me go now.

52
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:05,000
Once you've fallen in love with me,
tell me right away.

53
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:08,159
So I can do what I want to do.

54
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Pa?

55
00:12:20,919 --> 00:12:22,080
Pa!

56
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:25,039
Pa!

57
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,879
Ah, Dad!

58
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
What?

59
00:12:31,639 --> 00:12:33,440
Why were you lying there?

60
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,360
Oh, I was just thinking about things

61
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,440
and dozed off right there.

62
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:43,480
You're not saying you were thinking
about Nai, are you?

63
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,320
Huh?

64
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,320
How did you know?

65
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,399
Oh?

66
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,679
Huh? Oh! Well...

67
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:54,480
The thing is,

68
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,440
I just thought about today
when Nai thanked me

69
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,039
for not revealing Madame's secret.

70
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,120
Really?

71
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,480
Yes!

72
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,639
That's all there is to it.

73
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:10,519
Let's turn in.

74
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,679
Come on.

75
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,600
Hello, Nade.

76
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,399
I'm sorry I was late.

77
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:00,320
I've wanted to come to see you

78
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,360
ever since we chatted online.

79
00:14:03,159 --> 00:14:04,399
But I was stuck
in an urgent meeting.

80
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:07,320
This project's worth a lot too,

81
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,840
so I couldn't let my subordinate
handle it in my place.

82
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,639
You don't have to brag
about your wealth.

83
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,799
I know you're not really rich.

84
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,799
I just need someone to drink with me

85
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,960
and listen to my stories.

86
00:14:23,559 --> 00:14:26,559
I thought of calling my friends,
but they're annoying.

87
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,440
They always blab about themselves.

88
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,960
So you were the chosen one.

89
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,559
I'm very honored.

90
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:40,000
So tonight,

91
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,200
I'm going to do my best
to fulfill my duty.

92
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,159
What are you drinking?

93
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,840
Excuse me, can we
have the same for the lady?

94
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:59,279
And on the rocks for me, please.

95
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,480
Excuse me?

96
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,279
Yes?

97
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,519
Can I get another
strawberry smoothie, please?

98
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,559
Of course.

99
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:24,159
You invited me out for a drink,

100
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,919
but I didn't expect
you'd be drinking...

101
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,320
Heartbreak is hard enough
on the heart.

102
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:37,840
Why would I drink alcohol and cause
myself physical harm too?

103
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,960
- Lita.
- Yes?

104
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,759
When Nai announced he's going
to make a move on Pa,

105
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:52,080
didn't you feel anything?

106
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,440
No.

107
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,879
I guess I don't have
any feelings for him.

108
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,080
Oh? Then am I alone on this boat?

109
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:05,159
Oh?

110
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,759
If Pa really has feelings for Nai,

111
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,159
then you should move on to
another woman.

112
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,360
- I should move on to another woman?
- Right.

113
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,480
Then who would that be?

114
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:14,639
Me.

115
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:16,840
Huh?

116
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,960
Well...

117
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,600
I mean...

118
00:16:22,039 --> 00:16:24,519
A single woman like me.

119
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,519
I have to go to the bathroom.

120
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,840
Then we'll leave.

121
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:33,840
You have to give me a lift though.
I didn't drive over today.

122
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,759
Oh? Lita?

123
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,320
Excuse me?

124
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,000
Can I have the receipt, please?
And I'll take the last one to go.

125
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,720
- Of course.
- Thank you.

126
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,759
What did I just say?

127
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:56,399
He's going to mock me if he knows
I have feelings for him.

128
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,039
- Come on, Nade.
- I need some cheering up!

129
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,599
That's Nade.

130
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,440
Who's she with?

131
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:14,410
- Hey!
- Agh, it's hot!

132
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,799
I tried to flag you down.
Why didn't you pull over?

133
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,440
- Did you buy your...
- Nade!

134
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,119
It's that guy.

135
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:38,319
I want caviar!

136
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:41,410
- Are you okay?
- Sure.

137
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,680
- We're almost at the car.
- I'm hungry.

138
00:17:43,839 --> 00:17:45,680
- Are you hungry?
- I want more...

139
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,170
- Really.
- Excuse me?

140
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,000
Excuse me?

141
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:52,799
Hey,

142
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:54,440
Lalita!

143
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:57,000
Where are you going?

144
00:17:57,079 --> 00:17:58,599
Where are you taking her?

145
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,079
It's you.

146
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,039
Nade told me

147
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,170
to drive her home
if she gets really drunk.

148
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:07,920
Home?

149
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,000
Is that what she really said?

150
00:18:11,079 --> 00:18:12,960
That's right. Excuse me.

151
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,279
Let's go, Nade.

152
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,170
- Come on.
- Wait.

153
00:18:18,039 --> 00:18:19,839
People who know her

154
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,200
know she'd never let anyone
drive her home in that state

155
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,170
because her mother would be furious.

156
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,200
I don't see her car.

157
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:34,960
You're lying.

158
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:37,240
- Let's go, Nade.
- Hey!

159
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:38,720
- Come on.
- Where are you taking her?

160
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,890
Stay out of this!

161
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,119
- Let her go!
- I said stay out of this!

162
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,359
Lita, are you okay?

163
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,519
I am.

164
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:46,170
- Be careful.
- You should help Nade.

165
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:47,279
- Come on.
- I don't know

166
00:18:47,279 --> 00:18:48,519
where he's taking her.

167
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:49,759
Hold this.

168
00:18:49,839 --> 00:18:51,890
Hey, wait.

169
00:18:55,079 --> 00:18:57,759
You look familiar.
Have we met before?

170
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:01,839
You've probably seen me

171
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,680
in the news for social events.

172
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:05,240
I'm not a nobody.

173
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:07,000
So you don't have to worry

174
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:10,890
if I'm going to hurt her,
unlike that woman's accusation.

175
00:19:11,279 --> 00:19:12,839
I'm just going to drive her home.

176
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,759
Lalita is her friend.

177
00:19:16,650 --> 00:19:18,410
We'll drive her home.

178
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,170
I've been to her house often.

179
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:23,119
I think you should
just stay out of this.

180
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,480
Excuse me, Nade.

181
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,279
What are you doing?

182
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:34,799
What?

183
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:39,079
Come on, Nade.

184
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:40,240
Nade!

185
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,890
How dare you hurt him?

186
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:52,519
Darn it!

187
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,359
Wait! Not there!

188
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,650
Is that painful enough?

189
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,039
- Is that painful enough?
- You'll regret this!

190
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,359
- Regret what?
- You'll regret it!

191
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,559
Come back!

192
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,720
I haven't had enough yet!

193
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,599
Come back if you dare!

194
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,119
You liar!

195
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,440
Would you like another go?

196
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,359
You're just acting tough,

197
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:34,200
but you're actually a loser.

198
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,410
Liar! That's not enough
for someone like you!

199
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:45,839
Calm down, Lita.

200
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,920
- Calm down.
- Thom.

201
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,240
Give me that now.

202
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,319
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

203
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,680
I'm okay.

204
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,440
Hold on.

205
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,410
You're bleeding.

206
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
Does it hurt?

207
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:57,119
We're going up.

208
00:21:58,279 --> 00:21:59,680
- I can walk.
- This way.

209
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,839
- This way?
- Yes.

210
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:08,759
Over here.

211
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,559
- Come on, Nade. To the left.
- No fingerprint scanner?

212
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,279
This isn't like home at all.

213
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,680
Oh, Nade.

214
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:21,759
I'll go to bed.

215
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:23,599
Be careful!

216
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,160
We'll take her to pick up the car
tomorrow morning from the bar.

217
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,839
I think you should keep
her company tonight.

218
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,880
Because if we let her
stay here alone,

219
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,359
she might freak out

220
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:49,960
once she wakes up.

221
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,039
All right.

222
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,440
Thanks for letting her
stay the night.

223
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,319
She won't be able to go home
in this state.

224
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,480
But if we let
her stay at my place...

225
00:23:07,079 --> 00:23:08,640
Well, Dad doesn't like it
when she's drunk.

226
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,279
Why?

227
00:23:12,079 --> 00:23:13,680
I'm an angel!

228
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:18,119
Trai must be reborn as
a millionaire right this instant!

229
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:27,920
Oh, Trai! You're not
the nephew of a servant!

230
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,039
Not anymore!

231
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:34,839
- Trai!
- Ah!

232
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,680
This is just the beginning.

233
00:23:38,759 --> 00:23:40,720
We're in for a rough night.

234
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,519
- Just... the beginning?
- Yes.

235
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,480
You don't understand me, Mom!

236
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,279
I love Trai!
I want him as my husband!

237
00:23:52,359 --> 00:23:55,160
Why do you have to get in our way?

238
00:24:14,079 --> 00:24:16,640
Dao said you'd like to talk to me.

239
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,640
I'd like to talk to you as well.

240
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,039
Let's start with you.

241
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,039
What did you do to Pa yesterday?

242
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:31,480
Why was she smiling in her sleep
like she was possessed?

243
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,039
Really?

244
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,599
So that means I have a chance.

245
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:37,319
What chance?

246
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,400
And that's what I'd like
to discuss with you.

247
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,039
I'd like to tell you
that from now on,

248
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,279
I'm going to move forward
and try to win Pa's heart.

249
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:48,480
I will change her mind
so she doesn't divorce me.

250
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,480
You don't have my permission!

251
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,000
I'm not here to ask
for your permission.

252
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,400
I just wanted to let you know

253
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,799
so you won't be shocked
in case you spot me...

254
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:59,079
doing something romantic with Pa.

255
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,000
You want to be romantic with Pa?

256
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,880
Over my dead body.

257
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,160
Why, Father?

258
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,720
Don't you want to see her
happy with a good man like me?

259
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,240
I can't stand seeing my two
daughters sharing the same husband.

260
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,480
But Da's not here anymore.

261
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,160
She is!

262
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,279
She's always in my heart.

263
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:24,559
She's always in my heart as well.

264
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,759
Don't try to sound like a hero.

265
00:25:26,839 --> 00:25:29,599
If she were still in her heart, you
wouldn't have found a new wife

266
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,079
like how I've never been interested
in any other woman.

267
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,319
It's because you still haven't
found the right woman yet,

268
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,039
unlike how I've found Pa.

269
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:45,599
I didn't want to be remarried
just after my wife's passing either.

270
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,920
If I could choose,

271
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,960
I'd choose for Da to still be alive.

272
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,640
But since this is
how things were destined to be,

273
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:55,559
I have to choose

274
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:58,200
between being stuck in the past

275
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,119
or happy with the present.

276
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,960
Pa's present and future

277
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,160
is Thomtawee.

278
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,839
Do you know him? Thomtawee?

279
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,119
Let's wait for Pa
to make her own decision.

280
00:27:43,359 --> 00:27:44,359
Thom.

281
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,319
Oh, you're up.

282
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:47,880
Right.

283
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:54,319
- Does your cut still hurt?
- Not anymore.

284
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,480
But it's still visible.

285
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,799
It'll get better soon.

286
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,559
What do you think of Nade's
sleeptalking last night?

287
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,839
She was so loud.

288
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,119
Good thing my neighbor
is hard of hearing.

289
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:09,759
Otherwise, she'd come out
and curse at her.

290
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:15,920
I'll go and get Nade
so she can try your cooking.

291
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,079
Okay.

292
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:19,920
Hang on.

293
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,519
I bought some clothes for you
and Nade to change into.

294
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,839
They're over there.

295
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:29,119
Okay.

296
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,039
Do they fit?

297
00:28:49,119 --> 00:28:51,640
Thom just bought them
for us this morning.

298
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,440
Of course. But...

299
00:28:54,599 --> 00:28:57,519
The style and color
don't really work.

300
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,880
Anyway, let's go
and have some congee.

301
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,200
Thom's cooking. Come on.

302
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,440
Okay.

303
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:14,240
Pull over here.

304
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,599
- How much is it?
- Two hundred, please.

305
00:29:18,279 --> 00:29:19,359
Thank you very much.

306
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,480
Thom!

307
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,119
Oh, Uncle?

308
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,119
Thom, something horrible happened!

309
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,839
What's up, Uncle?
Why didn't you call ahead?

310
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,000
No, I couldn't.

311
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:39,359
I need to look you in the face

312
00:29:39,359 --> 00:29:41,920
when you promise me
you will defeat Nai!

313
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,680
What happened?

314
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,640
It's Nai. He came to tell me

315
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,200
he's going to try and win Pa's heart

316
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,160
within a month before their divorce.

317
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:53,200
He's going to make her
fall in love with him

318
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,480
so she won't divorce him.

319
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,400
Don't worry.

320
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,519
I'm on your side.

321
00:30:03,599 --> 00:30:07,039
I've raised Pa since her feet were
as small as a clamshell.

322
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:08,519
And how big are they now?

323
00:30:08,599 --> 00:30:09,799
- What do you think?
- This big.

324
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,839
Is this really the time for jokes?

325
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,119
I was only kidding. I'm sorry.

326
00:30:15,079 --> 00:30:18,160
She promised me
the day she married Nai

327
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:19,920
that she wouldn't fall for him.

328
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,839
She became Madame's
daughter-in-law just to avenge Da!

329
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,640
But if she's going
to break her promise,

330
00:30:30,759 --> 00:30:31,759
then bring it on.

331
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,240
Uncle? Uncle?

332
00:30:36,319 --> 00:30:37,359
What's wrong?

333
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,400
Are you okay?

334
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,680
I'm okay.

335
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,880
Well, actually,

336
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:51,680
I have known since yesterday

337
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,599
about Nai wanting to win Pa's heart.

338
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:58,880
I guess you've already come up
with a plan to get rid of him then?

339
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,519
Tell me. What is it?

340
00:31:06,039 --> 00:31:07,200
Well,

341
00:31:09,079 --> 00:31:10,079
if...

342
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,880
Pa's found the right person,

343
00:31:13,759 --> 00:31:15,039
I guess

344
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,000
I'll have to give up.

345
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,079
Hey! Thom!

346
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:24,599
You promised me
you were going to fight.

347
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,839
How come you got weak
all of a sudden?

348
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,200
Hey!

349
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:31,599
Let's head back to the bedroom.

350
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,720
I'm dying to call Mom
and tell her about this.

351
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:39,160
What was that?

352
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,359
Lita! Nade!

353
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:44,319
Are you okay?

354
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,160
Why are those two here?

355
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:52,079
Oh. Well...

356
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:54,319
There was a bit
of trouble last night.

357
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,880
Nade couldn't go home,

358
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,000
so I asked Lita to stay the night
to keep her company.

359
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:05,640
I'll have to go
and check on them. I'll be back.

360
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Sit down and rest, okay?

361
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,240
Don't call her yet, Nade.

362
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:18,799
I'm sorry.

363
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,079
I think Thom probably heard me
with all the clatter.

364
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,680
I think you should go
and talk to him.

365
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,200
Please don't make me go.
I'm a bad liar.

366
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,400
Lita?

367
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,960
- Go on, Nade! Go!
- I don't want to!

368
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,359
Nade?

369
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,759
Nade!

370
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,680
So he'll think we haven't
come out of the room yet.

371
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,599
Lita?

372
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,720
Lita?

373
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:10,119
Is something the matter?

374
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,920
What happened to your top?

375
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,799
Oh, Nade threw up on me.

376
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,240
She's got a hangover

377
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:20,319
and has been throwing up on me
since last night.

378
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,119
Is something the matter?

379
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,279
Did you come out
of the room just now?

380
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,880
Remember, Lita.

381
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,240
If you don't want him
to catch you lying,

382
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,079
look him in the eyes.

383
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,559
Because the eyes are
the window to the soul.

384
00:33:53,119 --> 00:33:54,480
Stare into his eyes.

385
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,839
Stare into his eyes.

386
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:05,799
No, I didn't.

387
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,679
I haven't gone anywhere else
since I went in.

388
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,039
And what's wrong with you?

389
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,000
Nothing. I'm fine.

390
00:34:18,329 --> 00:34:19,329
Oh,

391
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,329
Uncle Nit came by to visit me.

392
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,159
Are you hungry?
We can go out and eat...

393
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,519
Pa's dad is here?

394
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,679
Yes.

395
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:30,039
Since when? I didn't know.

396
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,809
Why do you have to be this shocked?

397
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:36,289
Well...

398
00:34:37,519 --> 00:34:38,599
Well,

399
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,960
He and Nade don't get along.

400
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:43,079
I'm worried he might tell Madame

401
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:47,289
about Nade staying the night here.

402
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,809
Oh.

403
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,239
It's okay.
If it's not about Pa, he won't talk.

404
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:53,400
Don't worry about it.

405
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,480
Oh.

406
00:34:54,769 --> 00:34:55,960
How nice of him.

407
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:59,329
Once Nade's feeling better,
we'll come join you.

408
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,559
Excuse me.

409
00:35:01,159 --> 00:35:03,079
Uh... Lita?

410
00:35:09,559 --> 00:35:10,559
Lita?

411
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,239
Lita?

412
00:35:13,809 --> 00:35:14,880
Hey.

413
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:16,960
Lita?

414
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,199
What? Thom!

415
00:35:28,329 --> 00:35:30,119
Lita, excuse me.

416
00:35:30,679 --> 00:35:33,039
Hey, what are you doing?

417
00:35:34,809 --> 00:35:36,000
There's no smell.

418
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,400
It's obviously just water.

419
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:42,039
I cleaned it all off.
That's why there's no smell.

420
00:35:43,199 --> 00:35:45,329
Someone forced you
to lie to me, didn't they?

421
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:48,039
- No.
- Yes.

422
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:50,360
There's a crook
in the bedroom, isn't there?

423
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:52,239
A crook?

424
00:35:53,329 --> 00:35:55,159
That guy, Tin.

425
00:35:55,239 --> 00:35:57,159
He might've followed us for revenge.

426
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:58,880
And I heard you screaming just now.

427
00:35:59,039 --> 00:36:01,519
It was very loud,
and I recognized your voice.

428
00:36:02,599 --> 00:36:05,519
And you acted weird just now

429
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,480
as if you had something to hide.

430
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:09,119
Lita,

431
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:11,480
seriously.

432
00:36:11,719 --> 00:36:14,039
There's a crook
in the bedroom, isn't there?

433
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,239
You're misunderstanding things.

434
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,679
There's no crook in the bedroom.

435
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:20,329
Okay, listen to me.

436
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,920
You have to stay calm right now.

437
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,400
Don't be so nervous
that you don't know what to do.

438
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,199
If they threaten you,

439
00:36:29,679 --> 00:36:32,400
don't be scared
or believe what they say.

440
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:34,679
The only thing
you should do right now...

441
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,559
is trust me.

442
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,239
I'll protect you.

443
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:46,239
No one's going to hurt you.

444
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:51,440
You're capable of
going that far for me?

445
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:53,769
Of course. You're in my house.

446
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:57,360
Your safety is my responsibility.

447
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:04,639
Okay. Find a place to hide.

448
00:37:04,719 --> 00:37:07,599
If something happens,
don't come out.

449
00:37:08,039 --> 00:37:09,639
I'll go in there and rescue Nade.

450
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,519
Thom!

451
00:37:14,329 --> 00:37:15,679
Calm down.

452
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,960
There really isn't a crook in there.

453
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:20,199
I was acting weird

454
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,480
because something's
stressing me out.

455
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:26,079
So I had to lie to you
because I didn't want you to know.

456
00:37:26,159 --> 00:37:28,519
I'll tell you later what it's about.

457
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:31,519
Really?

458
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,440
Really.

459
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,000
What's going on?

460
00:37:47,079 --> 00:37:50,880
Thom thought there was
a crook in the bedroom.

461
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,289
A crook?

462
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,199
There isn't one.

463
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:56,840
There are only lovely people here.

464
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,769
Isn't that right, Lita?

465
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,769
Yes, that's right.

466
00:38:04,519 --> 00:38:05,719
Come on, Lita.

467
00:38:05,809 --> 00:38:08,119
Let's go pack our stuff
so we can go home.

468
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:30,289
Good thing I'm quick-witted

469
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:33,000
and was able to
resolve the situation.

470
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:35,559
Otherwise, Thom would've
caught wind of what's going on.

471
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,559
I'll call Mom and tell her the news.

472
00:38:39,639 --> 00:38:40,639
Uh...

473
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,519
Let's not tell her on the phone.

474
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,360
You should go home
and tell her in person.

475
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,719
She might summon Pawinee
and deal with her.

476
00:38:48,809 --> 00:38:49,880
That's a lot more fun.

477
00:39:30,329 --> 00:39:31,480
Pa, my dearest daughter,

478
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,329
can you look at the tissue I used to
cover my mouth when I coughed

479
00:39:35,719 --> 00:39:38,920
and find out what the red stuff is?

480
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:46,199
Whoa.

481
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:50,809
It's the ketchup behind you.

482
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:59,360
Darn it! Why wasn't I more careful?

483
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,559
What's wrong, Thom?

484
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,289
I'm checking the CCTV footage.

485
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,599
I think there's a crook
in the bedroom with Lita and Nade.

486
00:40:09,679 --> 00:40:10,719
What?

487
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:11,809
Let me have a look.

488
00:40:13,519 --> 00:40:14,519
It's true.

489
00:40:19,519 --> 00:40:21,400
Let's head back to the bedroom.

490
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,559
I'm dying to call Mom
and tell her about this.

491
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,599
So the weird behavior

492
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:40,480
was because they
overheard us talking.

493
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:43,159
And I was worried sick.

494
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,960
Worried?

495
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,769
Who are you worried about?

496
00:40:47,329 --> 00:40:48,719
Both of them, of course.

497
00:40:48,809 --> 00:40:49,880
Huh?

498
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,289
Are you saying

499
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:54,480
you have feelings for those two

500
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:56,440
and are just going to forget
about my daughter?

501
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,840
No, I still have feelings for Pa.

502
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,769
But let's not talk about me.

503
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,289
Let's deal with this first.

504
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,079
Lita and Nade overheard
what we were talking about.

505
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:09,039
And if they tell Madame,

506
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:10,559
we're dead.

507
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,000
I'll go and stop them.

508
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,519
Hey, wait!

509
00:41:14,639 --> 00:41:16,440
- What, Uncle?
- There's no need.

510
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:19,199
Maybe it's good if she knows.

511
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,920
Then those two can finally
get a divorce.

512
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,559
- But if Madame knows...
- No buts.

513
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:25,440
We have to nip this in the bud.

514
00:41:25,519 --> 00:41:29,199
And the best person to do that is...

515
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:31,840
is...

516
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,239
Madame Nuan!

517
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,559
Is it yummy?

518
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:40,360
Nom, nom, nom.

519
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,400
- Dao.
- Yes?

520
00:41:43,519 --> 00:41:44,519
Where are the cockroach traps?

521
00:41:44,599 --> 00:41:46,400
There's a huge cockroach
in the big house.

522
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,769
- Oh, really?
- Yes, hurry up.

523
00:41:47,809 --> 00:41:49,239
Just a second. I'll find it.

524
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:50,769
- I won't be long.
- Come on.

525
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:54,719
It's Madame.
Cockroaches scare her witless.

526
00:41:54,809 --> 00:41:56,559
She loses her head
every time she sees one.

527
00:41:56,679 --> 00:41:57,960
I feel so sorry for her.

528
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:00,769
- Have you found it, Dao?
- Got it.

529
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,840
Here. Trap them all,

530
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,329
or Madame won't be able to sleep
if she spots one.

531
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,039
I know. I'm going now.

532
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:15,639
- Dao.
- Yes?

533
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:18,840
Why does everyone seem
so worried about Madame?

534
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,880
Well, we owe her gratitude.

535
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,039
But

536
00:42:25,679 --> 00:42:27,239
you work for her,

537
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,119
and she pays you a salary in return.

538
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:33,639
It's work, not gratitude.

539
00:42:34,199 --> 00:42:37,440
But for us, it's more than that.

540
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,920
We've been together for so long
that it became some sort of bond.

541
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,159
Even though she can be
a bit horrible,

542
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:46,519
she's okay in general.

543
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,289
She'll help us
when we're in trouble.

544
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,559
Even though
it comes out of our salary,

545
00:42:51,559 --> 00:42:53,519
it's still considered help.

546
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,960
- Oh, be careful.
- That's a no-no.

547
00:42:58,119 --> 00:42:59,519
Do you want some more?

548
00:43:00,639 --> 00:43:02,159
Madame's calling!

549
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,400
For whom?

550
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:06,199
Ms. Pa, of course.

551
00:43:06,289 --> 00:43:07,840
Would she be calling
for a dog or something?

552
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,329
Can you be polite
with Ms. Pa for once?

553
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,239
You should be thanking me
for wasting my breath

554
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:17,079
talking to Madame Nuan's enemy.

555
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:18,360
Exactly.

556
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:19,840
If we actually had no shred
of respect for you,

557
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,440
we would've wiggled...

558
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:30,039
We could wiggle our fingers to
call the fleas on a dog's back

559
00:43:30,039 --> 00:43:36,119
because some people always act
like fleas leeching off a dog.

560
00:43:38,809 --> 00:43:40,159
You two!

561
00:43:41,679 --> 00:43:42,679
It's okay.

562
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:46,880
Dao, can you give Nick a bath?

563
00:43:47,239 --> 00:43:50,519
If Nai comes back, tell him
I'll wait at the other house.

564
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:51,559
Okay.

565
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,239
All right, Nick.

566
00:43:54,199 --> 00:43:55,199
I have to go.

567
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,920
- Here.
- Thank you.

568
00:43:57,559 --> 00:43:59,199
You should go.

569
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:00,760
Don't listen to those two.

570
00:44:06,920 --> 00:44:08,199
- This way!
- This way!

571
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,840
- Tang!
- What?

572
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:23,440
That wasn't too harsh, was it?

573
00:44:23,519 --> 00:44:26,639
Not at all. That's how
they do it in a TV series.

574
00:44:26,719 --> 00:44:27,960
- Really?
- Of course.

575
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:30,599
- Wasn't that satisfying?
- Quite, yes.

576
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,599
We're thespians!

577
00:44:32,679 --> 00:44:33,760
Wait.

578
00:44:50,719 --> 00:44:53,039
I don't mind you being rude to me.

579
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:57,119
But don't act lowly
in front of my nephew.

580
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:59,559
If I witness you doing it again,

581
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:03,440
my knife isn't
going to miss its targets.

582
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,639
- Tom.
- Yes?

583
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:18,159
Are you here to see Madame?

584
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,760
Yes.

585
00:45:20,519 --> 00:45:21,719
Doesn't it look tasty?

586
00:45:22,199 --> 00:45:24,239
It does. What's the juice?

587
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:26,280
Freshly-squeezed juice.

588
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:27,639
I enrolled in a course

589
00:45:27,719 --> 00:45:29,199
so Madame can
drink something healthy

590
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:32,280
when she's stressed.

591
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,239
Do you mind?

592
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,960
Oh, not at all.

593
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,639
After you.

594
00:45:42,119 --> 00:45:43,159
Thank you very much.

595
00:45:50,239 --> 00:45:52,480
Madame, Ms. Pawinee is here.

596
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:58,960
By the way,
I'd like you to try this.

597
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,719
Freshly-squeezed juice.

598
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,000
I used celery, cucumbers,
green apples,

599
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:08,559
ginger, and lime.

600
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,679
It's a healthy recipe that can help
reduce your blood pressure.

601
00:46:23,679 --> 00:46:25,519
What do you think, Madame?
Is it good?

602
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,320
The ginger is too strong.

603
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:28,719
And the taste is a bit too sweet.

604
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:33,960
If you have a particular taste,

605
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,159
please let me know.
I can make it for you.

606
00:46:37,719 --> 00:46:40,159
I'll tell you if I want any.

607
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:43,480
Yes, Madame.

608
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,880
You can go.

609
00:46:48,639 --> 00:46:50,679
I'm going to talk to my in-law.

610
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,519
I know you're acting like
a good daughter-in-law.

611
00:47:15,679 --> 00:47:18,320
You congratulated me at the event

612
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:20,920
for the sake of Thomtawee's career.

613
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,679
That's right.

614
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,440
You're talented.

615
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,960
You did very well.

616
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,400
Because it helped cover up
the news about Nade and Trai.

617
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:44,800
This is for you.

618
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,280
(Pawinee Wongkulthanasup,
Fifty Million Baht in Total)

619
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,639
What's it for?

620
00:48:01,199 --> 00:48:03,079
Break up with my son.

621
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:04,920
You're a talented person.

622
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,480
This amount of money

623
00:48:07,039 --> 00:48:09,360
will help you stand on your feet.

624
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,639
Don't stay here
and let me hate your guts.

625
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:14,559
Or if you're not planning
on doing anything,

626
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,800
you and your father will
be able to live comfortably

627
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,320
for the rest of your lives.

628
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,920
Don't you want
a talented daughter-in-law

629
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,639
like me?

630
00:48:25,199 --> 00:48:28,840
I don't want my in-laws
to just be talented.

631
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,800
But they also have
to be rich like Lita.

632
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,119
Indeed.

633
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:40,159
You seem like a modern woman.

634
00:48:40,519 --> 00:48:42,159
But your mindset
is so old-fashioned.

635
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:44,039
People nowadays

636
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,599
are calling for equality.

637
00:48:46,679 --> 00:48:49,239
But you still judge someone's worth

638
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:51,559
based on their wealth.

639
00:48:51,639 --> 00:48:54,719
It's because I know equality
doesn't exist.

640
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,280
I was able to remain superior to
others because of money.

641
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,519
I know you and your sister

642
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:02,519
share the same belief as me.

643
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,880
Otherwise,

644
00:49:04,199 --> 00:49:06,239
why would you both
become my in-laws?

645
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,920
Do you think we married Nai

646
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,239
because of money?

647
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,760
I can't really think
of any other reasons.

648
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,199
If you think that we think that way,

649
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:26,000
then why did Nai marry us?

650
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,519
Because my son is too weak-minded.

651
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:34,880
Nai? Weak-minded?

652
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,400
That's not true.

653
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:41,480
He's not here.

654
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:44,280
You don't have to defend him
and win his favor.

655
00:49:48,199 --> 00:49:49,239
I think

656
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,000
I'm starting to get to know you
even better now.

657
00:49:57,559 --> 00:49:59,000
I refuse to accept the money.

658
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,480
I'm still Nai's wife,

659
00:50:01,559 --> 00:50:03,360
and Dad and I can also

660
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,719
live comfortably forever
because of that as well.

661
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:23,840
Pawinee!

662
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,960
What do you mean by

663
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:32,239
you're starting to know me better?

664
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,440
Why do you want to know?

665
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:38,159
In case a naive girl like you

666
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,679
might misunderstand me,

667
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:43,039
then gossip about me
and tarnish my reputation.

668
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,320
I don't think I misunderstood you.

669
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:48,400
I've learned more about you.

670
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:52,679
It's not that you judge
others' worth based on their wealth.

671
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,000
You just never see
anyone else's worth,

672
00:50:59,079 --> 00:51:00,880
especially not the people
in your house.

673
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:03,440
That also includes
your children, Tom,

674
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:04,840
and the other employees.

675
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,960
You never see their worth either.

676
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:09,039
You're too talented

677
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,559
and too successful

678
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:13,360
to the point
that you see everyone weak.

679
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:16,280
No one's ever good
enough in your eyes.

680
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:18,639
You're drowning in your success

681
00:51:18,719 --> 00:51:21,199
and are unable to see
how lucky you are

682
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,760
to be surrounded by people
who are loyal to you.

683
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:29,400
I'd like you to be prepared

684
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:33,000
because I'm going to convince
everyone to leave you soon

685
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:35,440
so you can finally understand
that your money

686
00:51:35,519 --> 00:51:37,159
can hire them for work,

687
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:38,960
but you can't hire their heart

688
00:51:39,039 --> 00:51:41,159
to love you like they always do.

689
00:51:41,639 --> 00:51:42,679
Pawinee!

690
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,320
What do you think you're doing?

691
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:50,920
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

692
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:52,880
Don't think you're so tough.

693
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:56,480
I can destroy everything you want.

694
00:51:56,559 --> 00:51:58,280
And if your father finds out

695
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,679
you were assaulted
by your mother-in-law,

696
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:03,280
he won't be able to stand it.

697
00:52:03,639 --> 00:52:06,039
And if he goes to the police
to have me arrested,

698
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:07,119
then that's great.

699
00:52:07,639 --> 00:52:09,239
So other people will find out

700
00:52:10,119 --> 00:52:13,360
the lovely mother-in-law image
you've created

701
00:52:13,679 --> 00:52:15,199
was all a lie.

702
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,559
And your fling's career

703
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:19,480
will be ruined.

704
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,239
That's what you managed
to come up with?

705
00:52:34,159 --> 00:52:35,480
You should surrender, Madame.

706
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:37,239
You can't do anything to me.

707
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,760
Your sister wouldn't have died

708
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:40,960
if she was as good
at dodging as you!

709
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,119
Madame's trying to provoke
Ms. Pa into slapping her.

710
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:52,760
- But why?
- Not a clue.

711
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,960
You should've taught your sister

712
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,079
that using her tears
to beg for her own life

713
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,800
isn't as effective
as using her head.

714
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:05,519
Oh, she didn't just cry
and beg for her life.

715
00:53:05,840 --> 00:53:08,559
She also prostrated at my feet too.

716
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,960
But I didn't give in

717
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:14,639
because I hated her!

718
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:17,920
It's a shame she died too early.

719
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:19,760
She should've stayed alive
so I could torment her.

720
00:53:27,519 --> 00:53:28,679
- Will she slap her?
- She will.

721
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:30,239
- She won't.
- How much do you want to bet?

722
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,920
- One hundred.
- Two hundred. She won't.

723
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,320
Three hundred. She will.

724
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,719
- One thousand.
- Huh?

725
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:35,920
She won't.

726
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:37,480
Do you have the guts, Pawinee?

727
00:53:37,559 --> 00:53:38,639
Go on then.

728
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,559
Do you have the guts
to slap your mother-in-law? Do it!

729
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,920
Are you trying to provoke me
into slapping you

730
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:54,719
so you can ruin the loving family
image I created yesterday?

731
00:53:55,199 --> 00:53:57,159
I won't fall for your trick, Madame.

732
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,599
I think I'm going
to let this little guy

733
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,840
help me deal with you instead.

734
00:55:09,519 --> 00:55:11,679
Your sister wouldn't have died

735
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,239
if she was as good
at dodging as you!

736
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,880
Pa, I heard Mom's scream.

737
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,000
What happened?

738
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:21,320
It's all your fault.
You didn't take good care of Da.

739
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:24,159
Why did you let your mom hurt her?

740
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:26,239
Pa, calm down.

741
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:28,519
Tell me what happened.

742
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:31,960
Forget it.

743
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,199
If you don't tell me,
then I won't let you go.

744
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,119
Just let me go, Nai.

745
00:55:38,199 --> 00:55:39,960
- Then tell me first...
- Ms. Pa!

746
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:41,960
Ms. Pa.

747
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:48,920
Yes?

748
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:56,639
Thank you for saying that
and sticking up for all of us.

749
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,159
I really appreciate it.

750
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,320
Oh.

751
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:02,320
It's not a problem at all.

752
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:05,239
I just spoke the truth
based on what I've seen.

753
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:08,440
Thank you.

754
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,960
Tom, what's the matter with Mom?

755
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,239
She's fine.
You can rest assured, sir.

756
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:19,880
Mr. Nai,

757
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:22,360
please cherish this woman.

758
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,639
If you break up with her,

759
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:27,159
I'm going to quit working
for your mother.

760
00:56:34,719 --> 00:56:35,719
Pa,

761
00:56:40,760 --> 00:56:42,239
so what's going on here?

762
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,079
I'll tell you later.

763
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,599
It's a long story.

764
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,800
Right now, I should get out of here
before I explode again.

765
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,079
Madame.

766
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:04,639
Did anyone take a video of me?

767
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:05,719
No, Madamae.

768
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,519
- Sompit, Tang!
- Yes?

769
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:11,320
Tell the workers in the kitchen

770
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:13,760
if there are any recordings of me
leaked to the public,

771
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:17,000
I'm going to take revenge
on all of their families!

772
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:18,559
- Yes, Madame!
- Yes, Madame!

773
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,800
Well, I'll bring your meal
here for you then.

774
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:26,599
I'm not having anything!
I don't have an appetite!

775
00:57:27,639 --> 00:57:29,079
Leave! Get out of here!

776
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,760
Pawinee, just you wait.

777
00:57:36,039 --> 00:57:38,079
I'm going to stomp on you
and bury you into the ground!

778
00:57:47,239 --> 00:57:48,559
Who's here?

779
00:57:49,239 --> 00:57:50,239
I'll go and have a look.

780
00:57:52,159 --> 00:57:53,840
Oh, that was my car.

781
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:59,159
I asked my driver to use a spare key
to pick my car up from the bar.

782
00:58:00,159 --> 00:58:02,760
Oh, sir! Hello!

783
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:04,159
There's no need for formality.

784
00:58:05,159 --> 00:58:07,360
Hello. Are you about to leave?

785
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:10,199
What a shame. Why don't you
stay for some congee?

786
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:11,840
Thom's congee is really good.

787
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:13,360
Oh...

788
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,280
Maybe next time.

789
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,960
I'll see you again.

790
00:58:17,039 --> 00:58:18,719
- Oh.
- Excuse me.

791
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:20,599
Bye.

792
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:23,039
- Lita.
- Goodbye, sir.

793
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:28,039
Come here, Thom.

794
00:58:32,239 --> 00:58:33,519
Nade.

795
00:58:34,239 --> 00:58:36,559
I've changed my mind.
I'm not coming with you.

796
00:58:36,639 --> 00:58:38,800
Oh? How come?

797
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:41,000
I don't think
there are enough seats.

798
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:42,920
And it's a very important matter.

799
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:45,239
You should only discuss it
with your family.

800
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:46,840
Besides,

801
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,840
if you're the only person
to tell your mother,

802
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,840
you'll get all the points.

803
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,480
Aren't you trying to convince her
to let you go out with Trai?

804
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:58,960
How did you know that, Lita?

805
00:58:59,800 --> 00:59:01,559
You were sleeptalking last night.

806
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,639
It's not just me who knows.

807
00:59:03,719 --> 00:59:05,400
Thom also knows.

808
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,079
If he tells Pa,

809
00:59:07,159 --> 00:59:08,800
you're going to be in trouble.

810
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:12,480
What you should do is
win points from your mother first.

811
00:59:14,119 --> 00:59:16,400
You're right. I'll be going then.

812
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:17,719
Nade.

813
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:19,320
Yes?

814
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:21,840
Don't call your mother
and tell her about it.

815
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,719
You'll win more points
if you talk to her face-to-face.

816
00:59:27,519 --> 00:59:29,440
- It's on.
- Good.

817
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:49,960
Drive home as fast as you can, Phol.

818
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:56,800
Trai.

819
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,960
I asked Uncle Phol to let me
pick up your car instead of him.

820
01:00:07,199 --> 01:00:08,760
If you were planning to
stand me up last night,

821
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:10,519
you should've just told me.

822
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:12,679
Do you know

823
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:14,760
I ordered your favorite
stir-fried garlic chives

824
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,880
with tofu and minced pork for you?

825
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:19,320
I was hoping that you could have it
as soon as you arrived.

826
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:22,280
But once it got cold,

827
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:24,880
I ate it all up.

828
01:00:25,519 --> 01:00:26,559
And then I ordered it again

829
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:28,880
so that you can have the best.

830
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,039
I spent the whole night eating
and waiting for you.

831
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:32,880
I ate dozens of servings.

832
01:00:34,119 --> 01:00:36,039
I ate all the garlic chives
the restaurant had.

833
01:00:36,519 --> 01:00:39,920
I'm about to cry
garlic chives right now.

834
01:00:48,159 --> 01:00:50,280
Enough. Stop talking.

835
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:52,960
Just hurry up and drive me home.

836
01:00:54,159 --> 01:00:56,280
I have something
important to do there.

837
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:00,559
Drive!

838
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,159
Thom.

839
01:01:46,360 --> 01:01:47,679
Yes?

840
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,119
Are you still thinking about that?

841
01:01:49,679 --> 01:01:51,559
Oh, about that.

842
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:53,000
Not anymore.

843
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:55,960
I was just thinking about work.
I'm about to call a client.

844
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:57,440
I see.

845
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,480
(Pa)

846
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,280
Oh.

847
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,719
You're going to call a client?

848
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:29,679
- Yes.
- Go on then.

849
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,440
Do it.

850
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:36,039
I won't tell anyone the secret
you'll be discussing with them.

851
01:02:39,159 --> 01:02:40,880
Are you thinking of calling Pa
and telling on me?

852
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:42,480
Dream on.

853
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:54,679
- Hello?
- Nai,

854
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,960
are you home?
Where are you right now?

855
01:02:57,519 --> 01:02:59,519
No, I just left home.

856
01:02:59,599 --> 01:03:01,360
I need to go somewhere with Pa.

857
01:03:02,239 --> 01:03:03,920
You have to hurry home now.

858
01:03:04,039 --> 01:03:07,679
Nade and I know now
you and Pa aren't really in love.

859
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,800
And Pa married you

860
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,559
because she wants
to take revenge on Madame.

861
01:03:12,679 --> 01:03:14,119
How did you guys find out?

862
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:15,559
From Pa's father.

863
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:18,159
Don't ask me anything now.

864
01:03:18,159 --> 01:03:19,920
You should hurry home and stop Nade.

865
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:22,239
Okay. Thank you very much, Lita.

866
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:23,719
Wait.

867
01:03:24,599 --> 01:03:25,599
Lita,

868
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,039
why are you willing to tell us this?

869
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,480
Because

870
01:03:33,199 --> 01:03:34,559
I have feelings for Thom.

871
01:03:35,199 --> 01:03:37,519
I don't want you
and Nai to break up.

872
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:39,199
It might give him hope with you.

873
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:42,719
But please don't tell him just yet.

874
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:45,079
I'm embarrassed.

875
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:47,559
Okay.

876
01:03:49,519 --> 01:03:50,920
Don't worry, Lita.

877
01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:54,719
I won't let Pa be
the enemy of your heart.

878
01:03:57,320 --> 01:03:58,960
Thanks so much for the heads up.

879
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:00,559
You're welcome.

880
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,679
Why did you pull over?

881
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:33,880
Nai?

882
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:46,920
How come you're here?

883
01:04:47,800 --> 01:04:50,599
I know you're about to go tell Mom
about me and Pa.

884
01:04:53,599 --> 01:04:55,039
How did you know?

885
01:04:55,719 --> 01:04:56,719
Nade.

886
01:04:58,119 --> 01:05:00,079
I've changed my mind.
I'm not coming with you.

887
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:02,320
Oh? How come?

888
01:05:02,880 --> 01:05:04,519
I don't think
there are enough seats.

889
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:06,440
And it's a very important matter.

890
01:05:06,519 --> 01:05:08,760
You should only discuss it
with your family.

891
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,360
Besides,

892
01:05:10,800 --> 01:05:13,360
if you're the only person
to tell your mother,

893
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,320
you'll get all the points.

894
01:05:16,039 --> 01:05:17,480
Lita.

895
01:05:18,119 --> 01:05:19,239
We need to talk.

896
01:05:19,760 --> 01:05:20,880
No.

897
01:05:21,239 --> 01:05:24,519
Don't try to stop me.
I'm going to tell Mom

898
01:05:24,639 --> 01:05:28,480
about you letting Pawinee marry you
to take revenge on her.

899
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,440
How did you find out?

900
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:32,559
- You knew?
- You knew?

901
01:05:33,599 --> 01:05:35,960
Yes. But just a bit.

902
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:37,960
Nai told me.

903
01:05:40,360 --> 01:05:41,360
You're misunderstanding us.

904
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,519
I agreed to marry Pa

905
01:05:44,119 --> 01:05:46,559
not because I willingly let her in
to take revenge on Mom.

906
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:49,599
But I wanted her to
get to know Mom better.

907
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:52,920
And it's working.

908
01:05:53,679 --> 01:05:55,480
Today, I've just received assurance

909
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:57,400
that Madame never sees
anyone's worth,

910
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:01,079
whether Nai or you.

911
01:06:02,039 --> 01:06:04,239
But if I tell Mom about you,

912
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,480
she's going to see more of my worth.

913
01:06:06,559 --> 01:06:07,559
Oh.

914
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:09,079
Really?

915
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:12,199
Don't forget this isn't
the first time

916
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:15,920
you tried to harass Da or me
to win points from your mother.

917
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:17,519
And how did it turn out in the end?

918
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:19,159
Have you ever won her heart?

919
01:06:19,239 --> 01:06:21,679
You still have to prove
yourself repeatedly

920
01:06:21,760 --> 01:06:23,400
so that she can be impressed.

921
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,480
But it never works in the end.

922
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,800
I think the best thing for you

923
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:30,920
is to work with us.

924
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:33,440
Help us change her mindset

925
01:06:34,079 --> 01:06:36,960
because if she sees
other people's worth more,

926
01:06:37,079 --> 01:06:39,920
your life is going to
be happier as well.

927
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:47,960
Don't try and brainwash me.

928
01:06:48,199 --> 01:06:50,519
I'm going to tell Mom anyway.

929
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:52,079
Get in the car, Trai.

930
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,320
- Nade...
- No, Nai.

931
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:18,519
There's no need to go after her.

932
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:22,320
Your sister will choose to be
on our side eventually.

933
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,360
I refuse to accept the money.

934
01:07:39,599 --> 01:07:41,760
I'm still Nai's wife,

935
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:43,320
and Dad and I can also

936
01:07:43,519 --> 01:07:45,639
live comfortably forever
because of that as well.

937
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:56,360
It's unbelievable someone would dare
to turn down fifty million.

938
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,559
Ms. Pa is one tough cookie.

939
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:02,360
If you really admire her,
then you can work for her instead.

940
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:03,920
I'm also curious to know

941
01:08:04,320 --> 01:08:07,960
if she's able to pay you
as much as I am now.

942
01:08:13,719 --> 01:08:15,079
What can I do

943
01:08:15,400 --> 01:08:17,649
to get her out of my life?

944
01:08:19,239 --> 01:08:21,199
Refreshments, Madame.

945
01:08:22,609 --> 01:08:23,880
Pit,

946
01:08:25,079 --> 01:08:26,319
is my daughter back?

947
01:08:27,439 --> 01:08:29,279
Well...

948
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:31,529
There's another one.

949
01:08:32,199 --> 01:08:33,800
She's been gone for the whole night.

950
01:08:34,760 --> 01:08:37,279
So? Is she home?

951
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:39,199
She just got back.

952
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:40,880
How?

953
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:42,359
Uh...

954
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,039
She came home with Trai.

955
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,680
Did he come home last night?

956
01:08:48,760 --> 01:08:49,960
He didn't.

957
01:08:50,399 --> 01:08:53,359
He told Auntie Erb he was
staying the night at a friend's.

958
01:08:55,159 --> 01:08:56,609
Go and get Nade.

959
01:08:56,920 --> 01:08:59,569
And don't let anyone in
unless I ask.

960
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:01,359
I want to talk to my daughter.

961
01:09:01,439 --> 01:09:03,279
- Yes, Madame.
- Yes, Madame.

962
01:09:21,159 --> 01:09:22,880
If Trai knocks you up,

963
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,609
there's no way
I'm letting you keep the baby.

964
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:29,569
Stop! You worked with my father
to betray me.

965
01:09:29,649 --> 01:09:31,039
Enough. I'll tell you.

966
01:09:31,119 --> 01:09:33,479
I'm going to win Pa's heart

967
01:09:34,649 --> 01:09:35,920
in two days.

968
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,479
All right then.
I'm a man of my word.

969
01:09:40,840 --> 01:09:41,840
It's a deal.

970
01:09:42,479 --> 01:09:44,439
How are you going to make me forget

971
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:47,079
that you're the son of the woman
who left Da to die?

972
01:09:47,680 --> 01:09:49,319
You'll find out when the time comes.

973
01:09:50,159 --> 01:09:53,079
You only married Nai

974
01:09:53,159 --> 01:09:54,680
to avenge Srikanda.

975
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:55,840
Yes, Dad.

976
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,760
Don't use my wife
to hurt my mother again.

977
01:10:00,359 --> 01:10:01,760
Mom.
