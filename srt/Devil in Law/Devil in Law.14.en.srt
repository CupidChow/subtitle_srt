1
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,560
Enjoy the moment

2
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,199
while it lasts.

3
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:42,090
Mister.

4
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:44,479
Do you remember me? It's me, Pa.

5
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,319
If you don't want this file
to end up with the police,

6
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,120
get Pawinee

7
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,439
to divorce my son.

8
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,919
How dare you come here
and threaten me...

9
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,360
What on earth is your problem?

10
00:02:57,439 --> 00:02:59,080
Don't you see that he's dying?

11
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,759
I said, get out of the freaking way!

12
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,840
My father is having a heart attack.

13
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,520
Auntie Orn's taking him
to the hospital.

14
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,599
I'll come with you.

15
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,319
Dad had a heart attack because...

16
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,199
She told your father
about your hit-and-run.

17
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,319
It's five o'clock already?

18
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,360
Where's he off to?

19
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,839
I was in there for hours. Didn't it
occur to you to come and find me?

20
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,920
What if I had died?

21
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,730
Don't go just yet.

22
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:29,839
I'd feel sorry for Hell.

23
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:31,959
Pawinee?

24
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,399
Where's Phol?

25
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:35,279
How did you get
your hands on my car?

26
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,480
Pull over!

27
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:41,079
Pull over now!

28
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,279
This is not the way home.

29
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,920
Where are you taking me?

30
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:00,610
Hand over your phone.

31
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,360
I said hand it over!

32
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:14,680
What are you thinking of doing?

33
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,439
Where are you taking me?

34
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
Get out.

35
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,160
I said get out!

36
00:06:00,279 --> 00:06:01,279
Now!

37
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,959
Keep moving.

38
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,439
I said keep moving.

39
00:06:25,959 --> 00:06:27,399
I know you're just faking it.

40
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,560
Get up.

41
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Madame!

42
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,480
You're thinking
of getting back at me?

43
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,319
It's not as easy as you might think.

44
00:06:56,519 --> 00:06:57,680
This is a fake gun.

45
00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:02,519
Can you grab the gun
in the glove box?

46
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,040
You carry one around?

47
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,680
Take a look.

48
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,959
It's fake.

49
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:15,959
It's only for self-defense.

50
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:21,480
You dared to trick me?

51
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,879
Would you have agreed
to come with me

52
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,839
if I hadn't?

53
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,279
Let go of me!

54
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,439
Get up!

55
00:07:46,959 --> 00:07:48,079
What is this?

56
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:50,199
Look around!

57
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:51,879
Look!

58
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,360
I didn't bring you here to kill you
like what you're thinking.

59
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,000
But look at this.

60
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,519
The whole field

61
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,680
belongs to my dad.

62
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,480
Someone would come by and ask
if he'd like to sell it every year.

63
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,519
He never gets offered
less than a hundred million.

64
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,480
But he refuses to sell it.

65
00:08:10,839 --> 00:08:12,839
He chooses to keep it

66
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,319
so other people can
rent a cheap spot for farming.

67
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,839
If he sold it, they wouldn't
have any income.

68
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,240
Let me ask you something.

69
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:25,920
If you were him,

70
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:28,959
would you do what he's doing?

71
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:32,120
I'm not stupid.

72
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,480
If I were him,

73
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:36,450
I'd sell it and spend the money
on something else.

74
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,039
That proves it.

75
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,679
My dad's a lot nobler

76
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,450
and a better person
than you'll ever be.

77
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,159
So you have no right to kill him!

78
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,039
Is he dead?

79
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,330
If he dies,

80
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:57,519
it wouldn't be just a fake gun.

81
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,519
You crazy!

82
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,840
How could you be this cruel?

83
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,799
I don't care if we're
enemies forever.

84
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,519
You can do whatever to me

85
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:16,679
but don't involve Dad and Nai.

86
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,279
And if you can't manage to hurt me

87
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,960
without involving other people,

88
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,210
then keep this in mind.

89
00:09:26,759 --> 00:09:28,240
You little...

90
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:33,639
Pawinee!

91
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:46,519
Pawinee! Don't leave me here!

92
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,639
You left Madame
in the middle of the field?

93
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,799
It's very far from the main road.

94
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,879
How will she find her way out?

95
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,840
Don't worry.

96
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,919
I've already asked
someone to pick her up.

97
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:19,519
Can you pull over?

98
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,330
Mister?

99
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,639
Mister,

100
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,559
do you mind if I hitch a ride?

101
00:11:29,679 --> 00:11:30,679
Pa.

102
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:35,960
Where have you been?

103
00:11:36,159 --> 00:11:38,320
I was worried sick.
I couldn't reach you either.

104
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,759
My phone ran out of battery.

105
00:11:41,799 --> 00:11:44,399
I brought Madame over
and showed her my dad's land

106
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,919
so she'd stop looking down
on my family.

107
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,600
I'll stay the night
with Dad at the hospital.

108
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:53,440
I have to go and pack my things.

109
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,200
I'll give you a lift.

110
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:58,080
It's okay.

111
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,159
I already called Joy
to come and pick me up.

112
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:01,879
You should go home
and stay with Nick.

113
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,480
Wait, Pa.

114
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,679
What's wrong?

115
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,759
Are you mad at me?

116
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,440
No.

117
00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,200
Don't lie.

118
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,399
Tell me the truth.

119
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,480
We're a family now.

120
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,480
Let's be straightforward
with each other.

121
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:37,720
I'm starting to feel
unsure about us.

122
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:42,559
I don't know if I can stand
being the daughter-in-law

123
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:44,840
of someone who almost killed my dad.

124
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,759
We can't give up, Pa.

125
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,600
We're in this together.

126
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,000
Our parents will see

127
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,480
how good our love is.

128
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,039
Madame?

129
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,559
Madame.

130
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,440
Where were you?
Why are you so dirty?

131
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,279
I was so worried about you.

132
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,240
Here. Please climb down.

133
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,240
Can you climb down?

134
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,960
Ooh.

135
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,480
- Gosh.
- Tom,

136
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,440
pay him for the trouble.

137
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:47,879
Yes, Madame.

138
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,559
Sir?

139
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,440
Pawinee!

140
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,799
Madame did this to you.

141
00:15:59,919 --> 00:16:02,120
How long will I be
able to endure this?

142
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,519
- Jai.
- Trai!

143
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,879
Is Ms. Nade in her bedroom?

144
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,679
Why are you wandering around here?

145
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,279
Madame might see you.

146
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,679
Has she found out
about me and Ms. Nade?

147
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,120
Why wouldn't she?

148
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,320
Ms. Nade was wailing
the whole night.

149
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Ms. Nade.

150
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,320
Trai,

151
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,639
you have to go now.

152
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,240
Go!

153
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,759
Oh, love.

154
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,920
Ms. Nade?

155
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:18,720
Ms. Nade!

156
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:26,319
Ms. Nade!

157
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,680
- Ms. Nade!
- Trai!

158
00:17:27,759 --> 00:17:29,319
- Ms. Nade!
- Trai!

159
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:31,240
How could you?

160
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,599
You can't die!

161
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:34,920
How could you do this?

162
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,559
- Ms. Nade!
- Hey.

163
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:40,410
- Hey.
- Ms. Nade.

164
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,279
There!

165
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:44,359
I'm going to die
because you strangled me!

166
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,319
What's wrong with you?

167
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,890
Didn't you just
try to kill yourself?

168
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:52,200
Are you crazy?
I was just doing a starfish float.

169
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,000
- A starfish?
- That's right.

170
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:57,599
I want to transform into a starfish
so I wouldn't have a brain

171
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,319
to think about horrible things.

172
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:04,650
Ms. Nade...

173
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,279
I've made my decision.

174
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,440
I don't love Jang.

175
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,319
I'm only going to look after my kid.

176
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:16,200
I'm going to be a single-dad

177
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,680
whose heart beats only for you.

178
00:18:20,759 --> 00:18:23,170
I'm beautiful, rich, and clever.

179
00:18:23,319 --> 00:18:26,240
I have to choose what's best for me.

180
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,519
And that's not you.

181
00:18:27,759 --> 00:18:28,759
Ms. Nade.

182
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,000
What now?

183
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,480
- Darn it.
- Ms. Nade, wait.

184
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:35,799
- Hey!
- Listen to me.

185
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,000
Even though I'm not
the best guy for you,

186
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,279
I'm still the guy you love.

187
00:18:40,839 --> 00:18:42,410
Don't you think
you're flattering yourself?

188
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:44,920
Are you going to look me in the eyes

189
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:46,559
and tell me you don’t love me?

190
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:52,410
That's right. I don't love you.

191
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,839
What now?

192
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,000
If you dare, then let's prove

193
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,680
you don't actually love me.

194
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,480
You really want to prove it?

195
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,559
All right. Bring it on.

196
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:29,240
Nade!

197
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,799
Trai!

198
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:45,890
Well,

199
00:19:46,279 --> 00:19:50,319
Trai was teaching me how to dive.
We didn't kiss, Mom.

200
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:54,240
Nade, how dare you lie to me.

201
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,650
Trai tricked you
into falling for him

202
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,599
even though he already
has a wife and kid.

203
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:00,650
Are you still going to love him?

204
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,410
You're misunderstanding me, Madame.

205
00:20:03,319 --> 00:20:04,890
I didn't trick Ms. Nade
into loving me.

206
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,960
But I'm really in love with her.

207
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:10,559
What?

208
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:16,079
You don't know how to love yourself

209
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,279
and live a good life.

210
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:21,359
You're just wasting
your breath each day.

211
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,720
And you had the gall
to love my daughter.

212
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,000
Get out of my house

213
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,119
and don't ever
set foot in here again.

214
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:32,559
If you try to reconcile with her,

215
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:35,170
your aunt and uncle
are going to lose their jobs.

216
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,799
Trai!

217
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,240
Stop. Stop right there.

218
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:08,039
- Stop! Stop!
- Auntie!

219
00:21:08,119 --> 00:21:09,440
- Auntie!
- Erb!

220
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,480
Calm down. He's your nephew.

221
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:13,039
Hey! Let go of me!

222
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,799
That's for letting someone
call you a good-for-nothing.

223
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,759
So what are you going to do

224
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:22,960
about your relationship
with Ms. Nade?

225
00:21:24,119 --> 00:21:25,480
You're not going to stop me?

226
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,720
If you really are in love with her,

227
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:29,240
why would I stop you?

228
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,200
Should we just kidnap her?

229
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,440
What did you just say?

230
00:21:33,519 --> 00:21:35,680
- Auntie.
- Watch your mouth.

231
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:38,119
Hey!

232
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:41,440
So you're not mad at me?

233
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:42,650
I am.

234
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,960
You have to repent
by improving yourself.

235
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:13,440
It's locked.

236
00:22:13,599 --> 00:22:15,279
I guess no one's home?

237
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:17,839
They're probably out.

238
00:22:24,759 --> 00:22:27,960
No one's home. They moved out.

239
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,640
- Hello.
- Hello.

240
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,440
Do you know where they moved to?

241
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:41,039
I don't know. Tin picked them up
this morning.

242
00:22:41,119 --> 00:22:42,200
Tin?

243
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:45,799
Oh, he's Dum and Toi's son.

244
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:48,960
Do you want to know

245
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,200
what Tin told me
about Pawinee's secret?

246
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:54,319
Yes.

247
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,880
When she was a teenager,

248
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,720
she was involved in a hit-and-run.

249
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,160
I don't buy it though.

250
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,599
Tin? Is this him?

251
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,000
Yes, that's him.

252
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:21,079
Thank you very much.

253
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,799
Is something wrong?

254
00:23:30,599 --> 00:23:32,960
I think I know where
Mom got a clip of you now.

255
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:42,440
So he's the same guy that hurt Nade?

256
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,000
Yes.

257
00:23:44,759 --> 00:23:47,279
And he tried to befriend Mom

258
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:48,839
by telling her your secret.

259
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,359
So I took a screenshot of him
from the CCTV footage at home.

260
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:53,000
I might be able
to find out who he is.

261
00:23:53,319 --> 00:23:55,319
No one's ever told me about this.

262
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:58,680
I ask Dao not to

263
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,599
because I didn't want you
to be upset.

264
00:24:03,079 --> 00:24:06,000
I thought everything would end
if I talked to Mom.

265
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:08,759
But that's not the case.

266
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,359
I'm starting to feel uncertain
about Da's death

267
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:17,319
and what actually happened.

268
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,319
You're starting to believe

269
00:24:21,319 --> 00:24:25,519
Madame is capable of doing anything
to get what she wants, aren't you?

270
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,160
Why did you ask Pit to call me over?

271
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,480
Are you going to scold me
or rub it in again?

272
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:52,759
Here. Go on a shopping spree.

273
00:24:57,559 --> 00:24:58,960
Why?

274
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,960
Because I know

275
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,599
your broken heart

276
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,200
can be mended by shopping.

277
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:10,920
Here.

278
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,680
Spend it on whatever you want.

279
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:17,440
Forget about Trai.
He's got a wife and child.

280
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,960
I didn't think
you'd be this nice to me.

281
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,359
Remember this, Nade.

282
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:38,720
Even though
I've treated you horribly,

283
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:40,319
I'm the person

284
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,480
who wants the best for you
and loves you the most.

285
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,160
Jang,

286
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:04,519
can we meet?

287
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,039
We need to talk.

288
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:07,960
I'm busy today.

289
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,279
Can we meet tomorrow instead?

290
00:26:10,599 --> 00:26:11,720
Let's do tomorrow, okay?

291
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:13,839
See you then.

292
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,799
See you tomorrow.

293
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,960
Let's keep discussing business.

294
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,440
Here. This is your first payment.

295
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:33,319
Once the job's done,
Madame will pay you more.

296
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,000
So, how long do I have
to keep lying to Trai?

297
00:26:41,079 --> 00:26:44,519
Until Madame's sure
Ms. Nade has forgotten about Trai.

298
00:26:44,599 --> 00:26:49,000
What if her daughter remains
in love with him for years?

299
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:50,640
Then,

300
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,000
won't I be in trouble?

301
00:26:59,079 --> 00:27:02,240
Maybe if she were someone else.

302
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:04,960
But this is my daughter.
I know her well.

303
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:09,440
She's not going to fixate
on anything anyway.

304
00:27:10,119 --> 00:27:13,839
She'll probably forget tonight
when she's done shopping.

305
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,039
But you can't be
too certain, Madame.

306
00:27:19,599 --> 00:27:22,039
I have to hang up, Tom.
Someone's calling.

307
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:27,279
Hello?

308
00:27:27,839 --> 00:27:30,079
Hello. I'm Tin.

309
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,640
How did you get my number?

310
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,559
It's not beyond my capabilities.

311
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,279
I'm calling to thank you.

312
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,960
I've received the money.

313
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:43,759
Thank you very much, Madame.

314
00:27:43,839 --> 00:27:45,640
Is that all you wanted to discuss?

315
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,000
Not just yet.

316
00:27:47,079 --> 00:27:49,039
I just dropped
by my relative's house.

317
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:51,000
The lady next door told me

318
00:27:51,559 --> 00:27:53,279
Pa and Nai came by not long ago.

319
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,720
They've probably realized by now

320
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,119
I had a hand in filming the clip
that you now have.

321
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,640
Are you sure I'm not
going to be in trouble?

322
00:28:02,319 --> 00:28:03,680
Why are you so scared?

323
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:06,880
Pa and your son might
get the police involved.

324
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,279
If you're so scared,

325
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,319
why don't you find a way
to deal with it yourself?

326
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,720
You said you're quite
capable after all.

327
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,119
Deal with it myself?

328
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,079
I know you tried to use me.

329
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,200
Take it slow.

330
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:33,519
That's enough, now.

331
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,359
That's enough. The doctor said
you can only have a little bit.

332
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,759
- You're so stubborn.
- I have to drink a lot for now.

333
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,640
There, there. Calm down.

334
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,480
You'll get to eat heaps
after the surgery.

335
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,599
Oh, Pa?

336
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:00,839
- Hi.
- Hello, there.

337
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,960
Where's Nai?

338
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:06,200
Oh, he's gone to Chonburi.

339
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:10,119
A client asked him to go for
a meeting about some new work.

340
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:12,920
Pa,

341
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:15,519
he has to start fasting now.

342
00:29:15,599 --> 00:29:17,160
The surgery's scheduled for tonight.

343
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,279
Dad, hang in there.

344
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,920
You'll be healthy again
and feel a lot better

345
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,680
after the surgery.

346
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,319
- What?
- How did it happen?

347
00:29:35,319 --> 00:29:37,839
What about this hit-and-run?

348
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,640
Dad,

349
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,480
the doctor told you
not to stress out.

350
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:50,039
I'll stress out

351
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:51,440
if you don't say anything.

352
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:52,960
Tell me.

353
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
Well,

354
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,640
it's what you heard in the clip.

355
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:06,960
In 12th grade,

356
00:30:07,319 --> 00:30:09,480
when you were away at a scout camp,

357
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,720
I took your car out
to a friend's birthday party.

358
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,119
It was very dark

359
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,279
on the way back.

360
00:30:20,759 --> 00:30:22,480
The visibility was terrible.

361
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,440
And I didn't see the man
running out onto the road...

362
00:30:36,359 --> 00:30:37,759
- There!
- Ow!

363
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,759
You're lucky he's alive.
Otherwise, you'd...

364
00:30:43,839 --> 00:30:46,440
Dad, that hurt!

365
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:47,559
And did you learn your lesson?

366
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,200
Yes!

367
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,039
I learned the hard way.

368
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,599
Let's talk about something else.

369
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,079
Maybe we should

370
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:01,000
go on a trip after your surgery?

371
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,279
No.

372
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,079
Why?

373
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:09,119
I don't want to talk about
taking a trip.

374
00:31:10,079 --> 00:31:11,680
I miss Nick.

375
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,880
Can you bring my grandson over?

376
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,079
I want to see

377
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:17,200
both of your faces.

378
00:31:18,359 --> 00:31:19,640
In case, one day,

379
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,160
we don't get to see
each other anymore.

380
00:31:25,359 --> 00:31:26,400
Dad,

381
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,359
why are you saying that?

382
00:31:30,359 --> 00:31:32,160
Anything can happen.

383
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:34,839
It's better to say goodbye
in advance

384
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,519
than to part suddenly
like your mother and sister.

385
00:31:41,599 --> 00:31:42,720
Dad.

386
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,240
Oh?

387
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,079
Why are you crying?

388
00:31:50,079 --> 00:31:51,559
Come and sit here.

389
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,640
Come now.

390
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:55,720
Oh.

391
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:00,039
Don't cry.

392
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,039
Listen to me.

393
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:04,599
Come to terms with it.

394
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:10,480
Dying is a part of life.
It's inevitable.

395
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,160
We'll only be parted
for a short while.

396
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,960
We'll meet again in another life,
you, me, your mom, and your sister.

397
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:19,640
Stop saying that, Dad!

398
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:21,880
Oh?

399
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,960
Come here, you.

400
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,400
Really.

401
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,440
Who am I going to spend my life with
if something happens to you?

402
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,680
Oh.

403
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,920
I was just making a statement
and saying goodbye

404
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,480
- just in case.
- No,

405
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:41,119
- don't say that!
- There, there.

406
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,680
You have to recover
and stay with me.

407
00:32:45,839 --> 00:32:48,039
- Dad...
- There, there.

408
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:12,319
I've arrived
at the client's house, Pa.

409
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,400
Okay.

410
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,599
Dad's having surgery tonight.

411
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,079
Oh? What time?

412
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,279
Eight o'clock,
according to the doctor.

413
00:33:26,319 --> 00:33:28,640
But Dad wants to see Nick first.

414
00:33:28,839 --> 00:33:31,640
So he's asked Auntie Orn
and Joy to pick him up.

415
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:35,480
Okay. Once I'm done, I'll hurry
back to keep you company.

416
00:33:35,559 --> 00:33:37,519
- Thank you.
- Okay.

417
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,680
Hi.

418
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,039
Hey,

419
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:43,599
Nai.

420
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,920
Decha brought out some new devices
for us to try out.

421
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,799
Do we really have to?

422
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:51,039
Of course. He wants us to.

423
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,880
Come on. Do it for work.

424
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,720
- Hello.
- Hello.

425
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:00,039
Please, come in.

426
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,599
- What's Madame doing here, Mother?
- Right?

427
00:34:43,519 --> 00:34:44,880
Madame.

428
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,599
I won't press charges against you

429
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,239
for assaulting me the other day.

430
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:52,769
But I'll take it out on Pawinee.

431
00:34:53,329 --> 00:34:54,480
Madame!

432
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,289
What are you doing, Madame?

433
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,809
- Oh, my!
- Mother!

434
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,809
- Wait!
- Here's the phone!

435
00:35:09,159 --> 00:35:10,519
Hello, Joy?

436
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:14,289
Pa, Madame's here!
She brought the police too.

437
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:18,440
I think it has to do with you
leaving her out in the field.

438
00:35:19,159 --> 00:35:21,159
Okay. I'll go out now.

439
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:32,000
There you are.

440
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,920
That's her, Officer.

441
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,719
Are you Pawinee?

442
00:35:39,199 --> 00:35:40,199
Yes.

443
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:43,199
Madame Nuan is pressing charges
against you for assault,

444
00:35:43,289 --> 00:35:46,519
kidnapping, and inciting fear.

445
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:49,719
Please come with us
to the station for questioning.

446
00:36:06,199 --> 00:36:07,519
Where is everyone?

447
00:36:15,039 --> 00:36:16,679
Take her, Officer.

448
00:36:16,769 --> 00:36:17,769
Please come with us.

449
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:23,679
Who are those police?

450
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,840
Pa!

451
00:36:27,679 --> 00:36:30,719
I'll go with her, Mother.

452
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:32,360
Okay. I'll look after Nit.

453
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,400
Nit?

454
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:39,480
Where are you going?

455
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,079
Why are the police talking to Pa?

456
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,199
Police?

457
00:36:44,559 --> 00:36:47,329
Oh, one of them
was visiting a relative

458
00:36:47,329 --> 00:36:49,239
but couldn't find the room.
So they asked for directions.

459
00:36:54,289 --> 00:36:56,079
Where are you going? Nit?

460
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,880
Where are you going?

461
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,809
Hey! Where are you going?

462
00:37:00,289 --> 00:37:01,599
Let me have a look.

463
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,599
Nit!

464
00:37:17,289 --> 00:37:18,719
Do you think I was lying?

465
00:37:22,769 --> 00:37:24,199
And where's Pa?

466
00:37:24,769 --> 00:37:26,519
She went to pick Nick up, of course.

467
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,239
Go on. Get back inside.

468
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:34,289
- Move. Move.
- To where?

469
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,239
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- Oh. Here.

470
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,960
- Be careful. Watch your step.
- Okay.

471
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,809
- Oh? Here. I'll help you.
- Thank you.

472
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:53,679
Wow, you've brought a lot.

473
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:56,639
I was in the area,
so I bought you some desserts.

474
00:37:56,719 --> 00:37:57,719
That's so nice.

475
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,519
Thom isn't busy right now, is he?

476
00:37:59,809 --> 00:38:00,920
Well,

477
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,440
not with work.
His heart's busy though.

478
00:38:05,519 --> 00:38:06,519
Why?

479
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,119
Well, Thom doesn't
like disappointing a woman.

480
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:13,599
But Nadedao, Madame Nuan's
daughter, is very heartbroken

481
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,920
because he turned her down.

482
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Turned her down?

483
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,159
Why would he turn her down?

484
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:22,480
Please don't say
I'm gossiping about him.

485
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,920
He knows Nadedao has a crush on him.

486
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,440
That's why he's stressed.

487
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:29,480
Huh?

488
00:38:30,159 --> 00:38:31,960
Nade has a crush on Thom?

489
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:33,329
That's right.

490
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,880
Okay.

491
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,079
Huh?

492
00:38:39,159 --> 00:38:40,289
Thom!

493
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:42,289
Thom, I need to talk to you.

494
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,159
Okay, Joy. I'll hurry over now. Bye.

495
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,960
What did you say just now?

496
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:52,719
Nothing.

497
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,039
Is something wrong?

498
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,440
I know you're just faking it.

499
00:39:04,239 --> 00:39:05,329
Get up.

500
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,880
Madame!

501
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,719
You're thinking
of getting back at me?

502
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,639
It's not as easy as you might think.

503
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:33,480
This is a fake gun.

504
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:40,440
Even though it's a fake gun,

505
00:39:40,679 --> 00:39:42,639
she's still guilty,
isn't she, Officer?

506
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:43,719
That's right.

507
00:39:44,039 --> 00:39:46,329
She's guilty of threatening another

508
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:48,440
and inciting fear.

509
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:56,480
Threatening another
and inciting fear.

510
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:59,639
According to Section 392
of the Criminal Law,

511
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:04,599
whoever incites
fear or panic in others

512
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:06,159
through threats

513
00:40:06,289 --> 00:40:09,559
shall be imprisoned
for up to a month

514
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:11,920
or fined up to 10,000 baht

515
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:13,639
or both.

516
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,239
Isn't that right, Officer?

517
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:18,159
Yes, Madame.

518
00:40:21,639 --> 00:40:23,840
I'm going to admit to what I did.

519
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,920
But I'd like to request bail.

520
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:28,920
She can't request bail?

521
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:31,159
Isn't that a little too far,
Officer?

522
00:40:31,289 --> 00:40:34,039
My friend won't flee the country

523
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:36,000
just because she slapped
her mother-in-law.

524
00:40:36,289 --> 00:40:40,329
We have to detain her
for further interrogations.

525
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:42,360
Further interrogations?

526
00:40:42,719 --> 00:40:45,079
Or are you following
someone's order?

527
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:48,599
Be careful what you say. You could
be charged with slander.

528
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,960
Go ahead!
I'm going to tell the world...

529
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:52,480
Joy, that's enough.

530
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,809
That's enough. I made a mistake.

531
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,480
Thank you.

532
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:06,289
Excuse me.

533
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,559
No problem, Madame.

534
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,329
So,

535
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,559
I guess I've shown you

536
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:18,329
I can get back at you

537
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,840
without involving others.

538
00:41:22,329 --> 00:41:24,880
How long do you intend
to keep me here?

539
00:41:26,039 --> 00:41:27,039
Well,

540
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:29,769
as long as possible.

541
00:41:31,039 --> 00:41:34,289
But she has to see Uncle Nit
before he gets surgery tonight.

542
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,599
Oh dear.

543
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,840
What should we do then?

544
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:42,840
Let me out so I can go and see Dad.

545
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,480
Then you can do
whatever you want with me.

546
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,880
I'm really sorry.

547
00:41:49,239 --> 00:41:50,519
But it's necessary.

548
00:41:50,719 --> 00:41:53,289
I need you to finally realize

549
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,440
why I had to warn you

550
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:58,239
not to be enemies with me.

551
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:17,769
(Emergency Call 191)

552
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:18,880
Oh, ma'am?

553
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,329
- Hello.
- Hello.

554
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,199
I was visiting Thom at his office,
so I tagged along.

555
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,719
What happened?

556
00:42:26,289 --> 00:42:28,840
You can ask Pawinee yourself.

557
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,920
I have a meeting
with a client today.

558
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:33,159
It's good you're here, Thomtawee.

559
00:42:33,719 --> 00:42:36,960
I'd like to resign as the presenter
of Health Plus.

560
00:42:37,039 --> 00:42:40,840
You can demand compensation
for any damages. I'm happy to pay.

561
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:53,039
- Let's go.
- Okay.

562
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,639
- Joy?
- Thom!

563
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:04,880
Please.

564
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,519
Pa!

565
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:09,769
Thom?

566
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,000
Uh...

567
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:14,039
Do you mind?

568
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:15,329
Over there, please.

569
00:43:20,360 --> 00:43:21,360
Pa.

570
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:26,360
Is this even necessary?
Isn't it a little too far?

571
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,079
No, it's way too far.

572
00:43:29,289 --> 00:43:32,809
Pa has to see Uncle Nit
before he gets surgery tonight.

573
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:38,719
I think Nai can help me.

574
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,639
(Joy, Pa's Friend)

575
00:44:06,719 --> 00:44:08,000
It's a nice device.

576
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,519
It heats up quickly

577
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,920
and effectively burns calories.

578
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,360
Please relax.

579
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,559
Sure.

580
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,800
Ann, have you shown them
the brochure?

581
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:21,840
Not yet, sir.

582
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,639
- Hand them one.
- Yes, sir.

583
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:27,400
I can pick it up myself.

584
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,039
Thank you.

585
00:44:39,159 --> 00:44:40,800
Nai's not picking up.

586
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:44,679
We can't have any more delays.

587
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:47,159
He's gone to meet a client
in Chonburi, hasn't he?

588
00:44:47,239 --> 00:44:48,320
That's right.

589
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:51,079
It'll probably take
around an hour to drive there.

590
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:53,639
I'll go to him.

591
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,199
Thanks, Thom.

592
00:44:55,719 --> 00:44:58,280
Do you know
where his client's house is?

593
00:44:59,039 --> 00:45:01,719
I'll come with you.
I know the guys on Nai's team.

594
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:05,800
I'll call them and ask on the way.

595
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,400
Thank you so much, Lita.

596
00:45:23,039 --> 00:45:24,480
Yes, Lita?

597
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:28,360
Have you heard about your mother
putting Pa in jail?

598
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:31,119
She did?

599
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:34,559
I haven't heard anything about it.
What happened?

600
00:45:34,760 --> 00:45:37,559
She almost killed Pa's father
from a heart attack.

601
00:45:37,679 --> 00:45:41,000
Pa was very angry, so she left her
in the middle of a field.

602
00:45:41,559 --> 00:45:43,880
Then your mother called the police
to have her arrested.

603
00:45:44,599 --> 00:45:47,239
Can you call and convince her
to have Pa released?

604
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,599
I'm sorry.

605
00:45:52,679 --> 00:45:54,239
I hope you find yourself

606
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:56,559
a good man one day.

607
00:45:56,639 --> 00:45:58,920
You knew that
I fell for the wrong guy?

608
00:45:59,559 --> 00:46:00,679
I've known for a while.

609
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,679
What? Why didn't you warn me then?

610
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,039
- Well, I...
- I see.

611
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,800
You have been working with Pawinee.

612
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,800
- I...
- You wanted to break my heart

613
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,519
to avenge Srikanda.

614
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:13,320
No, it's not what you think.

615
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:17,880
No.

616
00:46:18,639 --> 00:46:20,800
Pawinee worked with Thom

617
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,960
and let Trai trick me

618
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:25,519
even though they knew
he had someone else.

619
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:29,079
What are you talking about?
I don't understand.

620
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:30,719
You don't have to understand.

621
00:46:31,039 --> 00:46:32,800
Just know that I'm not helping you.

622
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,719
Don't call me again.
You're wasting my time.

623
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:40,079
Nade?

624
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:41,159
Nade?

625
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:42,559
Oh?

626
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,320
Oh, Nade.

627
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:53,079
How much further?

628
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,519
We'll be there soon.

629
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,039
- Please give this to her.
- Sure.

630
00:47:00,159 --> 00:47:01,159
Thank you.

631
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,760
Pa,

632
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,840
I brought you some food
in case you're hungry.

633
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,159
Mother Orn just called.

634
00:47:09,239 --> 00:47:12,800
She said Uncle Nit thinks we
went to pick Nick up.

635
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:14,360
He doesn't suspect anything.

636
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,760
And he's already fallen asleep.

637
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:20,440
Do you mind picking Nick up
and bringing him to Dad then?

638
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:22,320
What about you though?

639
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:23,719
I'll manage.

640
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:27,880
I believe Nai will be
able to get me out.

641
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:37,639
(Recents: Joy, Pa's Friend,
Lita)

642
00:47:37,719 --> 00:47:39,039
How come there are
so many missed calls?

643
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,800
Did something happen?

644
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,639
Hey, Nai.

645
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,760
There are people here to see you.

646
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:51,079
Lita?

647
00:47:51,679 --> 00:47:52,920
Thom?

648
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:55,079
- Hi.
- Hi.

649
00:47:56,639 --> 00:47:57,760
What are you doing here?

650
00:48:10,039 --> 00:48:13,199
Thank you very much
for all your help, sir.

651
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:16,559
Please let me know if there's
anything I can do to help you.

652
00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:19,440
Goodbye.

653
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:25,840
(Nai)

654
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,679
(Nai)

655
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,159
Before telling me off,

656
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:37,320
you should know
what your wife's done to me.

657
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,159
Before getting back at her,

658
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,199
you should know Pa's
helped you before.

659
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:43,719
With what?

660
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:49,559
Pa was asking me
about Madame's secret.

661
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:52,320
I had to tell her.
I don't know how to lie.

662
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,960
I only told her
about the secret affair.

663
00:48:58,440 --> 00:49:01,440
It was a personal problem
that happened a long time ago.

664
00:49:01,519 --> 00:49:04,000
If Pa had used it to expose Madame,

665
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:05,960
Madame would have been able
to talk herself out of it.

666
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,519
Singkorn told Pa and her dad

667
00:49:10,039 --> 00:49:11,280
you had an affair

668
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:14,079
because he wanted the two of them
to get back at you.

669
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,199
But they didn't do it.

670
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,400
Do you know why?

671
00:49:21,199 --> 00:49:23,199
Because they wanted
to win your heart.

672
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:26,960
Because they can
sympathize with you.

673
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:31,960
We might want to see
Madame Nuan suffer

674
00:49:32,519 --> 00:49:35,079
the same way
she made us suffer with Da,

675
00:49:36,199 --> 00:49:37,960
but I'm a woman

676
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,280
and my dad has daughters.

677
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,280
If it was the other way around,

678
00:49:43,519 --> 00:49:45,199
we wouldn't want anyone

679
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,400
to expose our secret either, Nai.

680
00:49:50,719 --> 00:49:53,760
If Pa had chosen satisfaction
over righteousness that day,

681
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:56,639
I can't even imagine

682
00:49:57,159 --> 00:49:59,079
what your life
would be like right now.

683
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:06,840
(Women Detention Room)

684
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:43,039
I miss Nick.

685
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:45,239
Can you bring my grandson over?

686
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,440
I want to see

687
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,559
both of your faces.

688
00:50:49,599 --> 00:50:50,840
In case, one day,

689
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,519
we don't get to see
each other anymore.

690
00:50:55,079 --> 00:50:56,159
Dad,

691
00:50:57,079 --> 00:50:59,119
why are you saying that?

692
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:01,960
Anything can happen.

693
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,599
It's better to say goodbye
in advance

694
00:51:04,679 --> 00:51:08,199
than to part suddenly
like your mother and sister.

695
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:22,559
You can come out now.
Someone's here to bail you out.

696
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,079
Oh?

697
00:51:34,159 --> 00:51:36,760
- Is Dad gone?
- Yes.

698
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,000
The nurses took him to get ready
for surgery a while ago.

699
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:42,119
What about Nick?

700
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:43,760
I asked Joy to take him home

701
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:46,079
after he saw your father.

702
00:51:46,159 --> 00:51:48,079
I didn't want him to
stay here for too long.

703
00:51:48,159 --> 00:51:49,360
Oh.

704
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,800
- Pa.
- Yes?

705
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:52,239
Are you going to manage?

706
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,599
Should I stay with you?

707
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,880
It's okay, Auntie.

708
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:59,519
Dad's surgery is going to
take several hours.

709
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:00,840
You should go and get some rest.

710
00:52:01,679 --> 00:52:04,679
You can always call me
if anything comes up.

711
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,079
I will.

712
00:52:06,639 --> 00:52:11,079
Pa, did you find out what Nai said

713
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:13,440
to convince Madame to
drop the charges?

714
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,360
I haven't. I'll have to ask him.

715
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:27,039
Madame.

716
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,920
I have a private matter
to discuss with Singkorn.

717
00:52:30,639 --> 00:52:32,079
Please leave if you have
nothing to do with it.

718
00:52:32,679 --> 00:52:34,920
Wait. It's okay. You don't have to.

719
00:52:37,400 --> 00:52:38,519
Madame,

720
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:41,199
don't act
like a self-centered child.

721
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,840
We can discuss your matters later.

722
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:50,480
- Ah!
- Hey!

723
00:52:56,239 --> 00:52:58,480
Why did you tell Pawinee about me?

724
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:00,039
Well,

725
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:03,079
I just wanted to help prove

726
00:53:03,199 --> 00:53:06,599
whether or not Pawinee
is a suitable daughter-in-law.

727
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,960
If you don't tell me the truth,

728
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:24,920
the bullet won't miss this time.

729
00:53:25,480 --> 00:53:28,079
You betrayed me and offered
the job to someone else.

730
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,280
I help whoever gives me
a higher cut.

731
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,960
You were never sincere with me!

732
00:53:35,519 --> 00:53:36,599
I didn't know

733
00:53:37,199 --> 00:53:39,119
our relationship

734
00:53:39,239 --> 00:53:41,119
was based on sincerity.

735
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:42,960
And if I wasn't sincere to you,

736
00:53:43,079 --> 00:53:45,679
why would I want my daughter
to marry your son?

737
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,119
Because you're scared.

738
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,079
You're scared no one would want
to marry your daughter.

739
00:53:50,280 --> 00:53:51,599
I know

740
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,760
what Lita did overseas.

741
00:53:55,239 --> 00:53:57,440
She's just a promiscuous girl.

742
00:53:58,119 --> 00:53:59,119
She was pregnant,

743
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,719
and the man refused
to take responsibility.

744
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:03,559
Then he hit her
and caused her to miscarry.

745
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,199
How did you know that?

746
00:54:06,519 --> 00:54:07,519
I know.

747
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,559
I know everything you've done.

748
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:12,920
It depends on whether I talk
about it or not.

749
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:15,599
I didn't tell anyone about Lita

750
00:54:15,880 --> 00:54:18,039
because I'm greedy
and because of your company.

751
00:54:18,599 --> 00:54:21,519
It's the same as you wanting
my son as your in-law.

752
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:24,800
It's for the sake of money
and the profit you gain from me.

753
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:28,039
Don't you see? Our relationship

754
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,159
is based on profit.

755
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,840
It was never about sincerity.

756
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:36,800
If you betray me again

757
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,920
and blab about
when I was at my lowest,

758
00:54:40,519 --> 00:54:42,760
I will share your daughter's
secret to the public.

759
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,599
And you'll see

760
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,199
who's actually more rotten.

761
00:54:50,159 --> 00:54:51,400
Madame.

762
00:55:11,239 --> 00:55:14,039
Tom, deal with the damages with me.

763
00:55:14,159 --> 00:55:15,800
Pay as much as he asks.

764
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:18,920
And call the hospital and ask

765
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:21,679
how my son's father-in-law is doing.

766
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:25,000
Shouldn't I just call Ms. Pa?

767
00:55:25,559 --> 00:55:27,800
So she'll know you're worried.

768
00:55:28,639 --> 00:55:29,880
I'm not.

769
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:31,679
I just want to know

770
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,800
in case something
happens to her father

771
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:36,239
so I'll be ready to handle my son.

772
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:39,639
Yes, Madame. I'll do that.

773
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:45,079
Singkorn told Pa and her dad

774
00:55:45,519 --> 00:55:46,800
you used to be in an affair

775
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:49,599
because he wanted the two of them
to get back at you.

776
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:52,400
But they didn't do it.
Do you know why?

777
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,719
Because they wanted
to win your heart.

778
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,760
Because they can
sympathize with you.

779
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:00,159
If Pa had chosen satisfaction
over righteousness that day,

780
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:01,880
I can't even imagine

781
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,119
what your life
would be like right now.

782
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:07,760
Nit,

783
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:09,480
you have to be okay.

784
00:56:13,639 --> 00:56:15,079
Why are you slowing down?

785
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,480
I'm not.

786
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:19,519
But there's something wrong
with the car.

787
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,480
I have to pull over.

788
00:56:32,119 --> 00:56:34,679
Wait here.
I'll have a look at the car.

789
00:56:34,679 --> 00:56:35,679
Okay.

790
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,679
What's wrong with it?

791
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:53,559
I think the alternator's busted.

792
00:56:54,199 --> 00:56:55,360
A warning had been
popping up for ages now.

793
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,400
But I was too busy
to take it to the shop.

794
00:56:57,639 --> 00:56:58,639
Oh.

795
00:56:59,239 --> 00:57:02,000
It's very late. I don't think
anywhere will be open.

796
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:03,360
Uh...

797
00:57:03,639 --> 00:57:05,760
Let's wait here.

798
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,280
I'll have the car towed.

799
00:57:11,039 --> 00:57:12,039
Oh.

800
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:25,840
Just a moment, please.

801
00:57:32,679 --> 00:57:33,960
Okay. I found it.

802
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:35,400
I'll call you back.

803
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:36,920
Okay.

804
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,280
Okay. Bye.

805
00:57:43,519 --> 00:57:46,440
- Thom? Thom?
- Huh?

806
00:57:46,519 --> 00:57:48,920
Pa said her dad's still
in the operating room.

807
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,320
I'll call the towing company now.

808
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,000
Wait in car, okay?

809
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,960
I'll just wait at the back.

810
00:58:23,239 --> 00:58:24,400
Hey!

811
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,599
Hand over your money!

812
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,000
Now!

813
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:28,480
Do you have any? Give us your money!

814
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:29,960
Come on!

815
00:58:30,360 --> 00:58:32,239
Hand it over! Now!

816
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,519
Take it easy.

817
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,880
Uh, Thom...

818
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,599
Hey, stretch.

819
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:38,559
Where are your wallet and phone?

820
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,360
So where are they?

821
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,320
Come on!

822
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:45,639
The front door on the left.

823
00:58:45,719 --> 00:58:47,199
- Check it out!
- Quit the drama already.

824
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:52,760
There's a phone.

825
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:53,960
Whose is this?

826
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:56,960
It's my friend's.

827
00:58:57,679 --> 00:58:59,119
Good. What about yours?

828
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,719
Yours, now!

829
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,559
- The back door on the right.
- Have a look!

830
00:59:07,519 --> 00:59:09,079
Back away. Now!

831
00:59:09,519 --> 00:59:10,559
Back away!

832
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,880
Come on!

833
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:15,599
I can't find it!

834
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,119
Stop playing games with us,

835
00:59:18,199 --> 00:59:20,039
- stretch.
- Where is it?

836
00:59:20,719 --> 00:59:21,719
Thom.

837
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:23,000
- Help me find it!
- Okay!

838
00:59:26,039 --> 00:59:27,079
Thom!

839
00:59:27,159 --> 00:59:28,920
- You!
- Let's go!

840
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,000
Watch your step!

841
00:59:30,719 --> 00:59:32,039
Hey, Tack!

842
00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:33,119
Hurry!

843
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,360
Watch your step.

844
00:59:45,119 --> 00:59:46,599
Over here.

845
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,559
Hey, wait! Stop!

846
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,840
Are we really going
to go in there? It's dark.

847
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,119
Of course. We followed them
all the way here.

848
00:59:57,679 --> 00:59:58,760
- Come on.
- But it's dark.

849
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,480
I didn't know you carry
a flashlight around.

850
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:02,599
Come on.

851
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:04,119
Okay.

852
01:00:27,679 --> 01:00:28,679
This way.

853
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:31,159
Get in!

854
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,920
Joy, tell Auntie Orn not to worry.

855
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:50,119
I'll call right away
if there's anything,

856
01:00:50,599 --> 01:00:51,599
okay?

857
01:00:51,679 --> 01:00:53,079
(Operating Room)

858
01:00:53,159 --> 01:00:54,159
Sure.

859
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:56,599
Pa.

860
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,239
Nai.

861
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:46,719
They're probably gone now.

862
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:48,719
I think we should...

863
01:02:05,079 --> 01:02:06,079
Let's go.

864
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,400
Hey, where are you going?

865
01:02:22,199 --> 01:02:23,239
Hide here.

866
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,039
Can I borrow your phone?

867
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:30,440
Here.

868
01:02:30,519 --> 01:02:31,679
I'm going to call the police.

869
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:34,320
Let's wait here until they arrive

870
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:36,159
in case they're waiting
to ambush us outside.

871
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,360
What did you say to Madame?

872
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:53,159
Why was she willing to let me out?

873
01:02:55,679 --> 01:02:57,599
I just told her

874
01:02:57,800 --> 01:03:01,000
about you not telling anyone
about what she did to my dad.

875
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,679
You might be on the way
to winning her heart.

876
01:03:25,719 --> 01:03:27,199
How was the surgery?

877
01:03:27,519 --> 01:03:28,800
Everything went well.

878
01:03:34,679 --> 01:03:36,599
How come the police aren't here yet?

879
01:03:42,280 --> 01:03:43,960
- Lita.
- Hm?

880
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:46,000
Lita, are you okay?

881
01:03:46,559 --> 01:03:48,400
I'm scared they'll
come back to hurt us again.

882
01:03:48,639 --> 01:03:50,239
I don't want to die just yet.

883
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:54,960
Lita,

884
01:03:56,119 --> 01:03:57,599
I don't want to either.

885
01:03:58,119 --> 01:03:59,920
There are so many things
I still want to do.

886
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:07,119
Lita,

887
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,079
listen to me.

888
01:04:09,639 --> 01:04:10,920
I promise

889
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:14,039
I'm going to do everything
to get us out of here safely.

890
01:04:15,639 --> 01:04:16,760
You have to trust me.

891
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,840
Don't be scared, okay?

892
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,719
You thought

893
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,480
Nade has a crush on you.

894
01:04:49,239 --> 01:04:50,440
You were wrong.

895
01:04:52,039 --> 01:04:53,119
In fact,

896
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:55,719
the person who has a crush on you

897
01:04:58,199 --> 01:04:59,320
is me.

898
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:11,719
I was too scared to tell you
after all this time

899
01:05:12,639 --> 01:05:13,880
because I knew

900
01:05:14,159 --> 01:05:15,800
you had feelings for Pa.

901
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:19,159
But now that you've lost
all hope with her,

902
01:05:20,360 --> 01:05:22,440
I feel hopeful.

903
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,079
Do you think it's possible

904
01:05:41,840 --> 01:05:43,079
or impossible

905
01:05:43,920 --> 01:05:45,400
between us?

906
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,239
So?

907
01:05:58,519 --> 01:05:59,519
Huh?

908
01:06:01,320 --> 01:06:02,320
The police are here.

909
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:07,119
Let's go.

910
01:06:28,159 --> 01:06:30,400
How long before he wakes up?

911
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,000
It's going to be a while.

912
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,679
You can go home
and get some rest for now.

913
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:36,599
We'll give you a call

914
01:06:36,679 --> 01:06:38,239
once he's regained consciousness.

915
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:40,000
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

916
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:48,039
Pa,

917
01:06:49,199 --> 01:06:51,159
let's go home, take a shower,
and get changed.

918
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:53,519
We can come back to see him later.

919
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:01,599
Come on.

920
01:07:02,639 --> 01:07:03,679
Thank you.

921
01:07:16,679 --> 01:07:18,559
Officer, hello.

922
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:20,360
- Hello.
- I was the one who made the call.

923
01:07:20,440 --> 01:07:21,559
Oh, I see.

924
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,840
Are you both safe now?

925
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:24,920
We are.

926
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,599
Well then. Please come with me
and file a report at the station.

927
01:07:28,159 --> 01:07:31,039
- No problem. Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

928
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,119
And how's work?

929
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:52,280
The client asked me to work on
a product reveal for their sauna.

930
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:54,960
Did you accept it?

931
01:07:55,280 --> 01:07:56,280
Of course.

932
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:58,239
I don't mind
whether the job's big or small

933
01:07:58,400 --> 01:07:59,639
as long as someone's hiring me.

934
01:08:00,119 --> 01:08:01,719
I want the company to grow

935
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:03,360
so I can take care of my family.

936
01:08:11,519 --> 01:08:13,199
Come here!

937
01:08:18,239 --> 01:08:19,569
- Nai!
- Pa!

938
01:08:20,479 --> 01:08:22,279
Hey! Come on!

939
01:08:22,359 --> 01:08:23,649
Pa!

940
01:08:24,569 --> 01:08:25,649
Get in!

941
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:28,399
Get in the car!

942
01:08:29,479 --> 01:08:31,319
Get in!

943
01:08:39,479 --> 01:08:40,720
Pa!

944
01:08:41,319 --> 01:08:42,529
Pa!

945
01:09:00,399 --> 01:09:01,399
Come and give me a hand!

946
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,569
Come on! Hurry!

947
01:09:04,609 --> 01:09:05,609
Heave!

948
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:14,840
Hurry!

949
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:16,960
Go!

950
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:43,840
Nai got stabbed, Mom.

951
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:44,960
Nai got stabbed?

952
01:09:45,960 --> 01:09:46,960
What happened?

953
01:09:47,609 --> 01:09:49,239
I'm sorry, Nai.

954
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,399
We are going to film her naked.

955
01:09:56,569 --> 01:09:57,720
Madame!

956
01:09:57,720 --> 01:09:58,920
The doctor said
Nai is losing a lot of blood.

957
01:09:58,920 --> 01:09:59,920
He needs a blood transfusion.

958
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:01,920
- Nai...
- Ms. Pawinee?

959
01:10:02,159 --> 01:10:04,039
- Yes?
- Mr. Panit has gone into shock.

960
01:10:04,119 --> 01:10:05,439
His heart may stop beating.

961
01:10:05,529 --> 01:10:07,279
The doctor is trying to save him.

962
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,800
I'm about to have no one left.

963
01:10:13,479 --> 01:10:15,359
You have hurt everyone I love.

964
01:10:15,439 --> 01:10:18,439
Everyone I love is dying.
All of them.
