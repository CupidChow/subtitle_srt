A mother’s love!

14
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,583
Go! Go! Go!

15
00:01:58,666 --> 00:02:00,125
For education!

16
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,708
Hidalgo, go go!

17
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,333
For progress!

18
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:04,875
Hidalgo, go go!

19
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,708
For urbanization!

20
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:07,833
Hidalgo, go go!

21
00:02:07,916 --> 00:02:09,916
For whatever you want!

22
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,416
Hidalgo, go go!

23
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,333
A mother's love!

24
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:15,791
Hidalgo!

25
00:02:15,875 --> 00:02:17,541
Your momma too!

26
00:02:17,625 --> 00:02:18,875
Hidalgo!

27
00:02:18,958 --> 00:02:20,416
Go! Go! Go!

28
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,500
Your momma too!

29
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,000
Is my momma too!

30
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,125
What a trash!

31
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:24,291
Clean streets!

32
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,125
Good economy!

33
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:29,250
Hidalgo, go go!

34
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,083
Homes for everyone!

35
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,833
Food on every table!

36
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:35,541
Hidalgo, go go!

37
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,833
A mother's love!

38
00:03:38,916 --> 00:03:41,541
Hidalgo, go go!

39
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,833
For education!

40
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,416
Hidalgo, go go!

41
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,125
For progress!

42
00:04:21,416 --> 00:04:22,416
Sir.

43
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,500
- Sir.
- I caught you.

44
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:31,416
You only started working when you saw me.

45
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
- You, Marinette?
- I’ve been working.

46
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:34,750
Really?

47
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,458
Maybe you’re just flirting with these two?

48
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:38,708
Clean this up!

49
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:40,000
Yes, sir!

50
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,541
Handle it well, okay?

51
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:45,583
That's from Mr. Mayor.

52
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:47,375
- That's important.
- Good morning, sir.

53
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,125
Were those accounted for already?

54
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,416
Yes, sir.

55
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:53,125
Those are important.
We'll give those to our coordinators.

56
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:57,166
If it’s short, I’ll take it from your pay.

57
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,250
Yes, sir.

58
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,208
- Hey, Diego!
- Boss?

59
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:02,416
What’s this?

60
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:05,000
Why is there blood?

61
00:05:05,083 --> 00:05:06,458
We’ll get caught!

62
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:07,916
Clean it up! Wash it!

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yes, sir!

64
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,125
How are we doing?

65
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:14,500
- Do you have enough bullets?
- Yes, sir.

66
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,208
- Complete?
- Yes, sir.

67
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,375
If we run into a fight, we need that.

68
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:25,875
Boss, we'll go ahead.

69
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,083
Wait!

70
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:30,166
We haven’t even prayed yet!

71
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,458
Oh, right!

72
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,291
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

73
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,958
Bless our operation, oh Lord…

74
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,000
Hey!

75
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:45,916
I’m not done yet.

76
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,541
Bless our operation, oh Lord,

77
00:05:56,625 --> 00:06:00,541
and we hope our Mayor wins.

78
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,875
Our candidate is the only one
who deserves to win this election.

79
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,750
And not the piece of shit opposition.

80
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,500
Help us and guide us

81
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:09,250
to defend our candidate

82
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,208
for the betterment of our town

83
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:15,750
and for the good of those
who have faith in our candidate.

84
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:20,875
We ask this
in the name of your son Jesus. Amen!

85
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:22,500
- Amen!
- There you go.

86
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,500
Let’s go.

87
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,750
It's boss.

88
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,916
Hello, boss.

89
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,833
Everything’s just fine, boss.

90
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,041
Our coordinators are ready.

91
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:41,500
No worries. I’ll handle it, boss.

92
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,791
Ah, boss, not all.

93
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,041
There are three policemen
who refused to go on board.

94
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,708
Mrs. Maritess?

95
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,416
Onions, garlic, lemongrass.

96
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:59,291
Anyone home?

97
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,375
Grandma Lisa?

98
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:03,958
Hey, son!

99
00:08:04,041 --> 00:08:05,166
Delivery!

100
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,833
I’ve been waiting for you.

101
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,291
Where’s the money?

102
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:11,291
Grandma, use the code words.

103
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:12,833
You’re too obvious.

104
00:08:12,916 --> 00:08:14,250
So what?

105
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,125
We’ll get caught.

106
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,416
Who will tell on us?

107
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,916
Everyone here is doing the same thing!

108
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,791
Just sign here.

109
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,083
Let me have it.

110
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:27,708
Here.

111
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,541
Berting!

112
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,250
Grandma?

113
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:40,000
Come here.

114
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:41,625
Go on.

115
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,791
This early?

116
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:46,916
At least we’re sure they’re still at home.

117
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:48,916
Go on.

118
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,375
Hey, you forgot something.

119
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,791
What’s this for?

120
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,875
If they’ll vote for the opponent,

121
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,916
raise your offer to PHP800.

122
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,500
If they’re stubborn, give them PHP1,000.

123
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,750
Then mark them
with "incredible" ink, okay?

124
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,041
But they won’t be able to vote anymore.

125
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,500
For the opponent?

126
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,916
Hey, it's about to rain!

127
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,125
Yeah, right.

128
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:23,916
Brother Will!

129
00:09:24,916 --> 00:09:26,583
Here it is.

130
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:28,916
Blessings.

131
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,083
Wait, wait, they said to give you
the "incredible" ink.

132
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:36,458
You can’t vote anymore.

133
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,583
Mother!

134
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,333
Mother!

135
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,666
Blessing!

136
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,000
- What do you say?
- Thank you.

137
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,250
Welcome.

138
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,083
- You know what to do, okay?
- Yes! I get it.

139
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,708
Hey, too early for gossip, huh?

140
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:59,791
Hey, JC! You’re so snobbish now!

141
00:10:01,583 --> 00:10:02,833
Vangie!

142
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,625
Vangie!

143
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:06,625
- Want some money?
- Who doesn’t?

144
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:09,416
Buy milk with that.

145
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:11,500
Do you also need milk money?

146
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,583
- I also need vitamins.
- Here, Mother.

147
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,125
We need money for milk.

148
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,541
Here you go. You know what to do, huh?

149
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,208
- Are you sure?
- Yes! I’m sure.

150
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,500
Teacher Emmy!

151
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,500
Teacher Emmy! Good morning.

152
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,708
Son of a bitch!

153
00:10:36,791 --> 00:10:38,333
What’s good about the morning?

154
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:42,416
I know what you’re going to say,
so don’t even try.

155
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,125
Someone that beautiful
shouldn’t be so crass.

156
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:51,958
You know, I can’t recall
when I asked for your opinion.

157
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,916
I’m just joking, Teacher Emmy.

158
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:57,041
Can't you take a joke?

159
00:10:57,125 --> 00:11:00,833
Joke with me when we’re close.

160
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,291
And when you’re no longer buying votes.

161
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:05,041
You don’t want money?

162
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,125
Sorry, Teacher used curse words.
Please don’t do that.

163
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,333
Okay, going back.

164
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,250
Look.

165
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:34,000
The texture of the egg changes
when soaked in vinegar.

166
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,833
Because vinegar is an acid!

167
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:45,583
So, the calcium carbonate
in the eggshell is what?

168
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:46,750
What?

169
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,583
Andrea?

170
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:54,625
Delicious?

171
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,416
Base…

172
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:04,541
acid.

173
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,708
Andrea? Base!

174
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,166
Andrea,

175
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:18,250
your mom in Dubai

176
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,625
is working her behind off for you.

177
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:25,083
Maybe repay her with some effort, okay?

178
00:12:25,791 --> 00:12:27,083
Just a little effort.

179
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,666
Gone!

180
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,750
Enzo, Jimbo.

181
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,500
Stop that.

182
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:35,625
Almost done.

183
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,708
Wait, Ma. I’m winning.

184
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,583
I’m teaching here!

185
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,250
I’m winning!

186
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,250
- Like that?
- Yeah!

187
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,416
Come on, Mom.

188
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:55,125
Five minute extension, please?

189
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:57,208
What five? I still need to catch up.

190
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:13,750
All right.

191
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,375
- Nice one.
- Come on.

192
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:22,500
Bro, you know your problem?
You think you’re smart.

193
00:13:22,583 --> 00:13:23,666
You know that?

194
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:26,000
But I am smart. Right, Ma?

195
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,958
I don’t want to get involved.

196
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,041
What if we bet on it, huh?

197
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,958
- All right! How much?
- Bet.

198
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:37,166
PHP50! This is yours too, if you win.

199
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,250
- Game!
- Game?

200
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,583
Your candidate, Hidalgo, won’t win.
Get it?

201
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,500
The people hate her.
That’s why there’s a protest, right?

202
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:45,583
Dumbass.

203
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:48,750
She’s going to win over Edraline,
a former bold star.

204
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:50,791
Why? It’s his body.

205
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:53,958
His body, his rules. You know that?

206
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,708
He’s no longer a bold star now.

207
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,833
Why? Is he naked on his posters?

208
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:01,125
Basketball players and comedians
become senators.

209
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,791
Why not a bold star as mayor?

210
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,916
Speaking in English
won’t prove your point.

211
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,333
Okay, fine, it’s his body.

212
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:10,125
But that’s not how voters think.

213
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,166
How do you know? Are you a voter?

214
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,166
Yes!

215
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:16,375
That’s why his picture
spread on Friendster.

216
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,833
I saw them. On the beach.

217
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,791
You can almost see
his pecker bulging in his briefs.

218
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:23,708
Put your feet down.

219
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,333
Why did you search for his pecker?

220
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:26,625
Why not?

221
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:27,916
Of course, research!

222
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,375
Voter’s education!

223
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:30,958
Wait!

224
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:35,041
Did you email your dad?

225
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,375
Did you reply?

226
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:37,791
Not yet.

227
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,583
Why not? The dollar exchange rate is high!

228
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:41,250
It’s not likely to go down!

229
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:44,708
What if the election results
are good and the peso strengthens?

230
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,375
Go reply. Don’t be lazy.

231
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:48,083
And what are you two talking about, huh?

232
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,541
What are you talking about?

233
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:50,916
- He said peckers.
- What?

234
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,250
Eat some more.

235
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,458
Still hungry?

236
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,791
- Thanks.
- Talking about nonsense…

237
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,583
Hey, Emmy! Cousin! What’s the latest?

238
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,708
They’re talking about peckers.

239
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:08,500
Hey, you! You didn’t even
tell me you were coming here.

240
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,125
Come on. Eat!

241
00:15:11,208 --> 00:15:12,500
No, I’m done.

242
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:13,875
Maybe dessert.

243
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,708
Are you going to the picket line?

244
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:23,458
I can. But I can’t stay long.
It might raise some eyebrows.

245
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,833
We’re going to play basketball.

246
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:31,125
Can we?

247
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,458
And now you ask for permission.

248
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,541
All right. Be careful.

249
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:40,666
- Thank you.
- That's not you.

250
00:15:46,375 --> 00:15:48,125
What’s the issue?

251
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,625
Of course, it doesn’t look good
with the election right around the corner.

252
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,875
And a poll watcher is there
protesting against the Mayor.

253
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:02,125
Wait. Let me show you something.

254
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:04,958
Look.

255
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:07,833
What do you think?

256
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,375
HIDALGO, MURDERER!

257
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,500
‪Open!

258
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:33,083
Defense! Defense!

259
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,000
Defense! Defense!

260
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,833
Sis, I'm excited about these guys!

261
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:49,666
You tend to the bitches.

262
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:53,125
Hey, sis, you handle them!

263
00:16:53,208 --> 00:16:55,250
Your balls are peeking under your skirt.

264
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:57,291
Pay up already!

265
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:02,125
Are you busy tonight?

266
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:04,916
- Not really.
- Why?

267
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,041
What's that?

268
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:09,375
Join me and Erhmengard later!

269
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:14,541
In the picket line.

270
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,666
There’s a vigil for Arnold Hernandez.

271
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:19,458
Your moms will be there. Join us.

272
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,750
Anything for you.

273
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,125
- Oh my…
- Justice for Arnold.

274
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:29,958
And justice for me.
Why do I get the girls?

275
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,208
Hey, tell him to go, okay?

276
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,625
I'll take care of it.

277
00:17:34,708 --> 00:17:37,166
Thank you. Thanks, cutie pie.

278
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,958
- Go there, okay?
- We’ll be there! Take care.

279
00:17:40,041 --> 00:17:42,125
- Hey, join us, okay?
- I already said yes!

280
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,250
Hey.

281
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,500
- Are you really going there?
- Yeah, let’s go.

282
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,208
She's such a killjoy.

283
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:52,000
We used to play basketball with her.

284
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,625
Since she joined the strike,
she’s changed.

285
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:59,000
Just let her be.
She seems to enjoy what she’s doing.

286
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:00,333
Being proud and loud.

287
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,125
Norberto dela Cruz.

288
00:18:05,958 --> 00:18:07,125
Come with us.

289
00:18:16,125 --> 00:18:17,083
Let’s go!

290
00:18:17,166 --> 00:18:18,208
Boss, what for?

291
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:20,500
Someone reported you to us.

292
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,291
Violation of the firearms ban.

293
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:24,833
- Firearms? Guns?
- I don't have any guns!

294
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,291
Grandma!

295
00:18:26,375 --> 00:18:28,875
I don't have any guns!

296
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:32,375
Sir, my grandson did nothing wrong.

297
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:33,708
Grandma, they found a gun on him.

298
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:34,708
Grandma, they say I have a gun.

299
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:36,125
I don't have a gun!

300
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,541
Ask anyone, I don't have a gun!

301
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,125
We didn’t just make this up. Let’s go!

302
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:43,625
- No. Just come with us.
- Boss! Boss, I don't have a gun!

303
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:44,708
- Stand up!
- Please, boss!

304
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,666
He will be released
after the election anyway.

305
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,666
- Shut up.
- Sorry.

306
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,791
Go. Come along!

307
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,458
Just come along. You talk too much.

308
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:53,708
Please, have mercy.

309
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,458
Come on. Move along!

310
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,791
Stop resisting!

311
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:05,833
Any criticism,
any little action, a little organizing,

312
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:09,208
and they give death
and violence in return!

313
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:16,166
Well, I’m not afraid!

314
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,208
Are you afraid?!

315
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:21,000
- No!
- No!

316
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:23,750
Yeah, a little!

317
00:19:23,833 --> 00:19:25,333
No! No!

318
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:31,458
Brothers and sisters,
a few words from Anita Hernandez.

319
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:40,333
Brethren! It's been three months!

320
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:42,833
Three months without justice!

321
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:47,666
We haven't received any answers
about the salary increase.

322
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,708
Even though 15,

323
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,583
15 large companies
are named under Mayor Hidalgo!

324
00:19:57,291 --> 00:20:04,041
Let's start with law firms,
call centers, security agencies!

325
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:07,833
Even this steel plant is under her name!

326
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,916
There are a lot of killings.

327
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,583
But she still refuses

328
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:18,791
to give her workers fair wages!

329
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,416
They are so shameless!

330
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,583
Lying Hidalgo!

331
00:20:22,666 --> 00:20:25,791
- Lying Hidalgo!
- Lying Hidalgo!

332
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,250
A year has passed…

333
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:36,291
but I still don’t have justice
for the death of my husband, Arnold.

334
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:42,625
Exactly a year ago, on this day,

335
00:20:45,125 --> 00:20:46,916
my husband was killed.

336
00:20:48,208 --> 00:20:50,916
Along with 12 of his fellow workers.

337
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,958
On the first night of the wake,

338
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,375
Mayor Hidalgo came to our home.

339
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:06,875
To offer two million pesos as condolences.

340
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:10,291
She called it charity.

341
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,916
LIAR
JUSTICE FOR ARNOLD

342
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,166
I can't blame the families
who accepted the two million!

343
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,875
But I did not take it.

344
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,291
And she said to me,

345
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:35,166
"If you don't take my goodwill,

346
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,083
I'll just give it to the judge

347
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,041
who will handle your husband's case."

348
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,416
Brothers and sisters…

349
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:55,666
the case is dismissed.

350
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,666
Where does power in the world come from?!

351
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,500
Isn't it from the body and mind
of each one of us?

352
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:17,291
But it is wrenched from our hands
by the powerful and the elites.

353
00:22:19,041 --> 00:22:22,000
But the true power is with us!

354
00:22:22,833 --> 00:22:25,458
Let's use it to shout,

355
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,791
Justice for Arnold!

356
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:34,833
- Justice!
- Justice!

357
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,708
Emmy, thank you so much.
This is such a great help.

358
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:41,750
No problem.

359
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:45,875
But I won't be long. It's risky.
Someone might see me here.

360
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:49,666
Sure. And please let me know
who will win in your precinct.

361
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:50,625
Of course.

362
00:22:50,708 --> 00:22:53,291
Then we'll see. Hidalgo might throw a fit.

363
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:55,583
I hope so.

364
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:58,541
Take care, okay?

365
00:23:00,458 --> 00:23:02,166
Let's give them this.

366
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,083
- Son, take this.
- Do you guys have soup already?

367
00:23:06,708 --> 00:23:07,791
- We have lime here.
- You all good, yeah?

368
00:23:07,875 --> 00:23:09,708
We have lime here. Take them if you want.

369
00:23:09,791 --> 00:23:10,708
Delicious!

370
00:23:24,708 --> 00:23:28,041
Son.

371
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,041
Why are you sleeping here?

372
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,583
I was waiting for you, Mom.
I know you didn't have the keys.

373
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:41,458
Wow, you fixed my clothes?

374
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,875
It's just the two of us here, right?

375
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:48,625
I'm serious. I'm just asking you.

376
00:23:50,458 --> 00:23:51,666
But thank you.

377
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:56,291
Go to bed now, Mom.
You'll be up early tomorrow.

378
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,000
Aren't you going to sleep in your room?

379
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:01,083
Nope. I'll sleep here.

380
00:24:02,416 --> 00:24:03,291
All right.

381
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,500
That’s good. What barangay is this again?

382
00:24:22,125 --> 00:24:23,208
Candoni.

383
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:25,208
Prepare everything.

384
00:24:25,291 --> 00:24:27,541
If there's an emergency,
you know what to do.

385
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:36,041
LAND NOT BULLET

386
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:56,625
Did someone spill perfume?

387
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,250
Wow, huh!

388
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,333
Really, Mom?

389
00:25:02,416 --> 00:25:04,416
Do you really need to wear perfume
to be a poll watcher?

390
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,833
Oh, of course!

391
00:25:05,916 --> 00:25:07,291
I'm a Girl Scout.

392
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:08,375
Always prepared!

393
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,541
Prepared for who?

394
00:25:11,625 --> 00:25:14,041
My PE teacher? Teacher Waks?

395
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,958
I'm not naming names.

396
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:17,791
The asthmatic karate teacher.

397
00:25:19,583 --> 00:25:20,708
Are you perfect?

398
00:25:20,791 --> 00:25:21,833
No.

399
00:25:21,916 --> 00:25:23,958
But you have more energy
than him, to be honest.

400
00:25:25,916 --> 00:25:27,750
- Really?
- Yes!

401
00:25:27,833 --> 00:25:29,166
You're flattering me again.

402
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:30,666
Okay, I'm leaving.

403
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:32,500
Take care, Ma.

404
00:26:16,875 --> 00:26:18,041
- Good morning.
- Emmy!

405
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:20,291
I have juicy gossip! You’ll love this!

406
00:26:20,375 --> 00:26:21,500
Mommy, later!

407
00:26:21,583 --> 00:26:23,875
- I have to go.
- I’ll wait for you later.

408
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,375
Ma'am, how is my child?

409
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,333
He's always a good boy!

410
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:35,208
Thank you!

411
00:27:04,041 --> 00:27:06,625
Okay, just some reminders for later.

412
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:10,833
Make sure the ones getting
the election results is verified!

413
00:27:10,916 --> 00:27:11,791
We have eight.

414
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:16,333
We'll give copies to the poll watchers,
volunteer groups,

415
00:27:16,416 --> 00:27:18,125
and the political parties.

416
00:27:25,291 --> 00:27:26,250
Thanks, ma'am.

417
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:32,125
Your thumb there, please.

418
00:27:58,625 --> 00:28:01,208
Here, you can share this. Thanks!

419
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,875
Waks, can you sub for me?

420
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:08,416
Of course, anything for you.

421
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,541
Name, please?

422
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:15,250
Ma'am.

423
00:28:21,125 --> 00:28:22,000
What are you doing?

424
00:28:22,083 --> 00:28:24,250
Ma'am, just distributing sample ballots.

425
00:28:24,333 --> 00:28:25,791
You know that's illegal, right?

426
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:28,000
Ma'am, sorry, I didn't know!

427
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,291
Didn’t you learn anything from our class?

428
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,041
Ma'am Emmy, sorry!

429
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,250
Are you going to have me arrested?

430
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:36,666
No, but I'll tell your mother.

431
00:28:36,750 --> 00:28:39,125
So you'll get spanked!

432
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:41,125
Can’t you see we’ve got work to do?

433
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:44,125
Okay, I will stop. I'm going home.

434
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:46,333
Sorry, ma'am.

435
00:28:56,625 --> 00:29:01,375
OFFICIAL BALLOT

436
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,541
Your thumb mark here, sorry.

437
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,708
Oh, let me do it.

438
00:29:53,833 --> 00:29:55,375
What's happening now?

439
00:29:57,125 --> 00:29:59,125
I don't know what's going on.

440
00:29:59,208 --> 00:30:00,458
I have no news.

441
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:02,916
Are we going to be here
till morning again?

442
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,416
Oh no, I hope not!

443
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,041
Every election, it's always like this!

444
00:30:07,125 --> 00:30:10,875
But, Loida, is there news
from other precincts about who won?

445
00:30:10,958 --> 00:30:13,166
I'm saving my battery. It’s low.

446
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,416
They say it's very close.

447
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:18,833
The Mayor might lose.

448
00:30:18,916 --> 00:30:20,583
They're just waiting for us.

449
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,125
- Loida.
- What?

450
00:30:27,708 --> 00:30:29,416
Can I borrow your pen?

451
00:30:31,875 --> 00:30:33,208
Return it, okay?

452
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,750
You always steal people’s pens.

453
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,208
I'll return it. Use this for now.

454
00:30:37,291 --> 00:30:39,708
Huh? What will I do with this?
There’s no ink.

455
00:30:39,791 --> 00:30:40,875
Try shaking it.

456
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:43,000
Unbelievable.

457
00:30:52,541 --> 00:30:53,625
Here.

458
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:03,208
- I am Commissioner Rodrigo.
- Yes, Commissioner.

459
00:31:03,291 --> 00:31:08,458
I need a volunteer to help us transport
the ballots to the Governor's Hall.

460
00:31:08,541 --> 00:31:10,166
There will be a security convoy.

461
00:31:10,250 --> 00:31:13,083
I'll go. I did it last election.

462
00:31:14,375 --> 00:31:16,083
How about someone else?
Give others a chance.

463
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,291
Sir, I can go instead.

464
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,250
I also have something to ask the Governor.

465
00:31:22,375 --> 00:31:23,541
Okay.

466
00:31:24,375 --> 00:31:25,500
Can I accompany her?

467
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:26,458
Why?

468
00:31:27,125 --> 00:31:28,833
Just to be safe.

469
00:31:30,291 --> 00:31:31,416
Is this okay with you?

470
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:44,166
We have a tradition
here in Salvador Benedicto,

471
00:31:45,291 --> 00:31:47,333
which is also done in other provinces.

472
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:01,458
The Governor has the key.

473
00:32:01,541 --> 00:32:03,250
Anyway, it's just symbolic.

474
00:32:05,625 --> 00:32:08,000
To prevent vote switching.

475
00:32:08,083 --> 00:32:09,083
- Let's go!
- Okay!

476
00:32:09,166 --> 00:32:10,041
All right.

477
00:32:10,125 --> 00:32:11,208
- Loida.
- Take care.

478
00:32:29,166 --> 00:32:30,250
You go first.

479
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:33,291
Got it.

480
00:33:10,708 --> 00:33:11,916
Nice view.

481
00:33:16,333 --> 00:33:17,458
Yeah.

482
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,250
Any plans tomorrow?

483
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:31,416
I mean, where will you spend
your Inspector bonus?

484
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,166
I haven't thought about it yet.

485
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:39,708
Let's go out. My treat.

486
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:45,000
Really?

487
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,333
That's something!

488
00:33:48,083 --> 00:33:50,000
Just food! No malice!

489
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,083
Why no malice?

490
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:10,541
Yes. Ah, okay.

491
00:34:16,625 --> 00:34:17,666
All good.

492
00:34:18,541 --> 00:34:19,791
Let's go.

493
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:24,458
Then he said to me,

494
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:28,041
"Sir, why is my grade 74?

495
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:32,083
Since it’s 74.3, round it off to 75!"

496
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:33,583
What's that?

497
00:34:33,666 --> 00:34:35,166
He doesn’t understand
how rounding off works.

498
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:40,083
One of my students too.
An honor student mind you.

499
00:34:40,166 --> 00:34:41,916
Her grade was already 94!

500
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,833
And she was still whining about it.

501
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,958
- That’s why--
- You know, I admire teachers.

502
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:51,166
What did you say?

503
00:34:52,791 --> 00:34:54,625
I said, I admire teachers.

504
00:34:58,291 --> 00:34:59,500
Just, wow.

505
00:35:00,666 --> 00:35:02,791
You mold young minds.

506
00:35:02,875 --> 00:35:04,916
You're also real-life heroes.

507
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,333
Because you guard the ballots.

508
00:35:08,791 --> 00:35:10,125
Thank you.

509
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:14,083
- And so--
- The problem with Filipinos,

510
00:35:14,875 --> 00:35:20,250
just because life is hard,
we sell our votes.

511
00:35:21,125 --> 00:35:23,791
We don't understand its true value.

512
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,041
You're right, brother.

513
00:35:30,208 --> 00:35:33,791
Anyway, Emmy, what did your student say?

514
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:36,916
So, I said we have an exam--

515
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,958
What about you? What would you do?

516
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,458
What do you mean?

517
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:48,708
For example…

518
00:35:50,208 --> 00:35:53,583
if you were offered
PHP10,000 for that box,

519
00:35:53,666 --> 00:35:55,250
would you accept?

520
00:35:56,541 --> 00:35:58,750
What's that? Of course not.

521
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,333
What if it's PHP20,000?

522
00:36:21,875 --> 00:36:25,166
BOARD OF ELECTION INSPECTORS
COMMISIONER

523
00:37:13,166 --> 00:37:14,500
B.

524
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:16,541
A.

525
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:18,416
B.

526
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,750
A.

527
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:21,333
Go down.

528
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,250
Emmy, sorry, I don't understand
sign language.

529
00:37:54,333 --> 00:37:57,708
Leave now! Go!

530
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:03,083
Leave!

531
00:38:03,166 --> 00:38:05,250
Just go!

532
00:38:10,041 --> 00:38:12,375
No! No! No!

533
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:16,500
You have to go now.

534
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,208
You have to go now.

535
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:43,708
Boss, it’s done. It’s okay now.

536
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:47,375
We have all the election returns.

537
00:41:16,375 --> 00:41:17,791
Good day, sir.

538
00:41:20,041 --> 00:41:21,833
Did you make the report about the bodies?

539
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,291
Yes, sir

540
00:41:27,458 --> 00:41:28,875
Okay. Bro…

541
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:32,458
you can’t tell anyone else, okay?

542
00:41:33,750 --> 00:41:34,916
Why?

543
00:41:35,916 --> 00:41:37,166
We will handle it.

544
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,208
Sir?

545
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:40,916
Don’t be stubborn. Just obey.

546
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:47,916
SLOW DOWN

547
00:42:35,583 --> 00:42:38,291
Boss, we're here now.

548
00:42:59,791 --> 00:43:00,833
Let me fix it, bro.

549
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,833
It's hard to fix a battery.

550
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,791
Does it still have battery?
Maybe it’s not charged.

551
00:43:57,875 --> 00:43:58,875
It is.

552
00:44:00,375 --> 00:44:01,333
There.

553
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:11,041
Enzo.

554
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:13,250
Mom, where are you?

555
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:16,750
I don't know.

556
00:44:17,333 --> 00:44:19,208
Forest. In the forest.

557
00:44:19,291 --> 00:44:20,250
Where are you?

558
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,041
Ma, are you safe?

559
00:44:23,208 --> 00:44:24,833
I’m okay. Where are you?

560
00:44:26,041 --> 00:44:27,625
At Aunt Melissa's house.

561
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,000
Where is Teacher Waks?

562
00:44:31,208 --> 00:44:32,166
He's gone.

563
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:34,083
Killed!

564
00:44:36,541 --> 00:44:37,500
How?

565
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:38,875
Shot.

566
00:44:44,500 --> 00:44:45,958
Who did this?

567
00:44:49,041 --> 00:44:50,833
I don't know. I don't know.

568
00:44:53,916 --> 00:44:56,625
Mom, who won in your precinct?

569
00:44:57,541 --> 00:44:58,500
Edraline.

570
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:01,416
It's likely Hidalgo is behind this.

571
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:03,708
Wait, Enzo.

572
00:45:04,583 --> 00:45:07,291
What happened in town?

573
00:45:07,375 --> 00:45:09,291
Yes, Mom, it's a mess.

574
00:45:09,375 --> 00:45:10,500
It's chaotic! It's chaotic here!

575
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:15,125
They say the counting is closed
and all the election results were taken.

576
00:45:15,208 --> 00:45:16,833
They say they’ll declare
a failure of elections.

577
00:45:18,791 --> 00:45:21,625
I have a ballot box.

578
00:45:24,291 --> 00:45:26,166
Mom, how can I help you?

579
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,416
Do you want me to go to the police?

580
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,041
No, no, no, Enzo.

581
00:45:31,125 --> 00:45:33,125
You won't go to the police.

582
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,875
We can't trust them.

583
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:36,916
Do you understand me?

584
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,291
Listen to me.

585
00:45:38,375 --> 00:45:40,750
We can't trust the police.

586
00:45:40,833 --> 00:45:42,166
All right.

587
00:45:42,875 --> 00:45:45,583
Who can help us?
The governor’s place is too far.

588
00:45:48,375 --> 00:45:49,750
What if it's Edraline?

589
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:53,958
I don't know.

590
00:45:55,458 --> 00:45:58,916
Mom, Edraline has men and guns.

591
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,416
Maybe he can help you.

592
00:46:01,166 --> 00:46:04,333
Right. Maybe, maybe, maybe.

593
00:46:06,958 --> 00:46:08,375
But, Enzo, listen to me.

594
00:46:09,083 --> 00:46:11,416
You can't go to the police.

595
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:13,750
Enzo! The police are here!

596
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:14,791
Enzo?

597
00:46:15,541 --> 00:46:17,250
What?

598
00:46:17,333 --> 00:46:18,791
- Wait! Why are you here?
- Sir, good evening.

599
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:21,125
Can I help you, sir?

600
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:22,500
Come on. Come with us.

601
00:46:22,583 --> 00:46:24,291
Wait a minute. Do you have a warrant?

602
00:46:24,375 --> 00:46:25,375
Why, sir?!

603
00:46:25,458 --> 00:46:27,625
We're not arresting you.
We just have some questions for you.

604
00:46:27,708 --> 00:46:29,250
- Sir, wait a minute!
- What is it?

605
00:46:29,333 --> 00:46:30,958
Let go of me!

606
00:46:33,375 --> 00:46:36,250
Do that again, I’ll blow your brains out.

607
00:46:36,333 --> 00:46:38,166
- Sir, that's enough!
- Pastor, let’s go.

608
00:46:56,333 --> 00:46:57,791
Answer me!

609
00:47:04,041 --> 00:47:05,291
Act normal.

610
00:47:05,833 --> 00:47:06,750
Yes, sir.

611
00:47:06,833 --> 00:47:07,916
Go on.

612
00:47:12,250 --> 00:47:18,916
- Go, go, go! Hidalgo!
- Edraline! Edraline!

613
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:26,875
We voted for Hidalgo!

614
00:47:26,958 --> 00:47:28,958
Hey, you parasitic bitch!

615
00:47:29,541 --> 00:47:31,833
What are you doing there?

616
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:35,458
Sis, this is just a gig. Get off my case.

617
00:47:35,541 --> 00:47:37,875
A gig? Bitch, you're part of the strike.

618
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:39,291
Have you no shame?

619
00:47:39,375 --> 00:47:41,416
Is this a factory or a farm?

620
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:46,083
Being a professional entertainer
is not part of the strike!

621
00:47:49,583 --> 00:47:51,375
Professional entertainer, you?

622
00:47:51,458 --> 00:47:54,250
You don’t even take baths! You stink.

623
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:59,500
Wow! You’re covered in so much foundation,
your face looks like a dirt road.

624
00:47:59,583 --> 00:48:01,416
Is every day foundation day?

625
00:48:10,375 --> 00:48:11,708
Hidalgo!

626
00:48:13,041 --> 00:48:14,250
I'm a natural beauty!

627
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:16,875
Who’s got my back?

628
00:48:16,958 --> 00:48:18,250
Hidalgo!

629
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,708
Enzo. Enzo!

630
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:37,333
Are you okay?

631
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,708
Hey!

632
00:48:47,333 --> 00:48:50,791
- Edraline!
- Edraline!

633
00:48:57,375 --> 00:48:59,458
Edraline!

634
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:02,958
Hidalgo!

635
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:05,250
Edraline!

636
00:49:18,333 --> 00:49:20,166
Get in.

637
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:12,208
Dammit. Where is Enzo?

638
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:21,375
Hey!

639
00:50:22,458 --> 00:50:23,833
How do you know Enzo?

640
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:34,875
Eat.

641
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:40,125
Thanks.

642
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:43,083
Enzo, right?

643
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:45,750
Yes.

644
00:50:47,083 --> 00:50:48,625
Jeremy Morales.

645
00:50:48,708 --> 00:50:50,083
I don’t know if you still remember me.

646
00:50:51,708 --> 00:50:53,541
Yeah. I know you.

647
00:50:54,083 --> 00:50:56,458
You were always at our house.
My mom was your tutor.

648
00:50:58,083 --> 00:50:59,125
Right.

649
00:50:59,750 --> 00:51:03,500
She was my teacher in fourth year,
then tutor in third.

650
00:51:05,375 --> 00:51:07,125
Don’t be too nervous, okay?

651
00:51:07,208 --> 00:51:08,666
We’re not arresting you.

652
00:51:09,291 --> 00:51:10,708
- Okay.
- Hey!

653
00:51:11,541 --> 00:51:13,458
We want to know the truth!

654
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:16,125
Have you talked to your mom?

655
00:51:17,125 --> 00:51:18,041
No.

656
00:51:18,958 --> 00:51:20,208
Do you know where she is?

657
00:51:21,291 --> 00:51:22,458
No, I don’t.

658
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:24,208
Are you sure?

659
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:26,541
Yes.

660
00:51:27,416 --> 00:51:28,833
MORALES

661
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:32,916
Do you know she’s a suspect
in a double murder case?

662
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,458
What?

663
00:51:34,541 --> 00:51:35,708
Double murder!

664
00:51:36,583 --> 00:51:40,125
The Commission on Elections
representative and her co-teacher died.

665
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,041
Waks?

666
00:51:43,125 --> 00:51:44,458
Hey.

667
00:51:44,541 --> 00:51:47,458
How did you know who I was referring to?

668
00:51:48,416 --> 00:51:51,250
The news has spread
that they’re both missing.

669
00:51:51,333 --> 00:51:53,958
The teachers
gossiped about it to me earlier.

670
00:51:55,958 --> 00:51:56,958
Okay.

671
00:51:58,875 --> 00:52:00,583
My mom would never do that.

672
00:52:00,666 --> 00:52:01,666
Idiot!

673
00:52:01,750 --> 00:52:03,166
She’s just a suspect.

674
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,041
The only suspect.

675
00:52:43,958 --> 00:52:45,208
Damn flashlight.

676
00:53:07,583 --> 00:53:10,041
Why are you here, Berting?

677
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:12,625
I don’t know either.

678
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:16,125
Two scoundrels planted a gun on me.

679
00:53:16,208 --> 00:53:17,166
Why?

680
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:20,083
Maybe they thought I switched sides!

681
00:53:21,625 --> 00:53:22,916
Don't trust those two.

682
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,458
They’re greedy bastards.

683
00:53:57,625 --> 00:53:58,750
Grandchild?

684
00:53:59,541 --> 00:54:00,666
Grandchild?

685
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:03,416
Grandma, why are you here?

686
00:54:04,208 --> 00:54:06,666
I brought your favorite noodles.

687
00:54:08,291 --> 00:54:10,000
Finish it all, okay?

688
00:54:10,083 --> 00:54:12,375
You really went through all this trouble.

689
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:13,791
You shouldn't be walking this far.

690
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,708
And here you are
going up and down the stairs.

691
00:54:15,791 --> 00:54:17,166
You'll be exhausted.

692
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:18,958
I'm fine.

693
00:54:19,916 --> 00:54:24,083
I know it's election season.
I'm sure you're tired.

694
00:54:28,750 --> 00:54:32,291
Isn't that Emmy's child?

695
00:54:32,958 --> 00:54:35,125
Why is he in jail? He’s a good kid.

696
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:38,583
It's just a ruse.

697
00:54:38,666 --> 00:54:40,958
He will be released after the election.

698
00:54:42,041 --> 00:54:44,208
What are you talking about?

699
00:54:44,291 --> 00:54:45,458
Stop this.

700
00:54:46,166 --> 00:54:48,041
That's not what I taught you.

701
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:52,833
You know I fully accept your identity.

702
00:54:53,833 --> 00:54:56,375
But I can’t get behind this.

703
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:57,875
This is vile.

704
00:55:05,791 --> 00:55:09,916
I'M OKAY, DON'T CALL

705
00:55:30,041 --> 00:55:33,166
A word from Mayor Elena Hidalgo.

706
00:55:33,250 --> 00:55:36,125
We're pleading for everyone to calm down.

707
00:55:36,208 --> 00:55:39,666
It's crucial
that we find the last ballot box

708
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:42,333
to avoid a failure of elections

709
00:55:42,416 --> 00:55:46,666
and know who the true winner is,

710
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,500
which is me.

711
00:56:33,250 --> 00:56:34,583
Call her.

712
00:56:37,625 --> 00:56:38,750
Call her.

713
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:05,791
Where are you?

714
00:57:07,125 --> 00:57:07,958
Who's this?

715
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:10,208
Talk to her.

716
00:57:14,208 --> 00:57:16,750
Sorry, Auntie, sorry. Sorry, Auntie.

717
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:18,375
Jimbo! Wait!

718
00:57:19,708 --> 00:57:21,166
I'm in the forest,

719
00:57:21,250 --> 00:57:24,125
near the old resthouse,
the one where Mayor's boytoy lived.

720
00:57:25,166 --> 00:57:26,375
Which one?

721
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:30,541
I don’t remember the name.

722
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:32,000
The one in the forest.

723
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:37,958
The one she poisoned!

724
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,333
Jimbo? Jimbo?!

725
00:57:49,083 --> 00:57:50,125
Jimbo?!

726
00:57:55,208 --> 00:57:56,125
Hello!?

727
00:57:56,208 --> 00:57:58,958
Make sure you're there
or your son is next.

728
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:02,583
Wait! Wait! No.

729
00:58:04,541 --> 00:58:06,875
Wait! Wait, please! Please!

730
00:58:07,666 --> 00:58:09,833
Hello?!

731
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:14,125
Hello?! Wait!

732
00:58:14,208 --> 00:58:18,166
Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch!

733
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:39,875
This is your fault! This is your fault!

734
00:58:42,666 --> 00:58:45,458
This is your fault!

735
00:58:53,666 --> 00:58:56,416
Enzo, wake up. Let's go.

736
00:58:57,708 --> 00:58:58,666
Let's go!

737
00:58:59,333 --> 00:59:00,458
Boss, what about us?

738
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:01,666
You’re out soon.

739
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:02,875
He’s out in 40 days.

740
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,083
Let’s go.

741
00:59:39,541 --> 00:59:42,583
How do we get
to the Mayor's dead boyfriend's house?

742
00:59:43,583 --> 00:59:44,875
The one she poisoned?

743
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:46,625
It's near.

744
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:50,875
Just turn left and go straight.

745
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:53,666
But, boss, the forest is dense there.

746
00:59:54,916 --> 00:59:57,125
So, just straight, I won't get lost?

747
00:59:57,708 --> 00:59:58,875
No, boss.

748
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:00,666
Boss,

749
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:04,500
is it true there's a reward of PHP250,000
for anyone who catches the teacher?

750
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:05,625
Yes.

751
01:00:06,541 --> 01:00:09,041
How much is that
if split among three people?!

752
01:00:09,125 --> 01:00:10,500
I'm not good at math.

753
01:00:10,583 --> 01:00:12,708
I'm sure it's a lot more
if it’s not divided.

754
01:00:22,750 --> 01:00:23,791
What is it?

755
01:00:36,708 --> 01:00:38,291
Hey, are you okay?

756
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:53,041
Ma’am Emmy?

757
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:56,333
Come out, Ma’am Emmy!

758
01:00:56,416 --> 01:00:58,875
You know what will happen
to your kid if you don’t.

759
01:01:00,166 --> 01:01:01,916
Ma’am Emmy!

760
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,375
So, the rumor is true.
Ma’am Emmy is quite a sight.

761
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,375
Too bad.

762
01:01:13,208 --> 01:01:16,125
Oh, don’t flatter me like that.

763
01:01:16,208 --> 01:01:20,166
A macho daddy like you
shouldn’t be lying to girls like me.

764
01:01:23,666 --> 01:01:27,041
You know, ma’am,
my top fetish is teachers.

765
01:01:27,958 --> 01:01:30,625
Well, number one is nuns, then teachers.

766
01:01:30,708 --> 01:01:32,458
Especially the older ones.

767
01:01:33,041 --> 01:01:35,791
Oh, don’t talk dirty to me like that.

768
01:01:36,375 --> 01:01:38,916
It's been so long
since I've been a with real man.

769
01:01:39,416 --> 01:01:40,791
And you know my type?

770
01:01:43,291 --> 01:01:45,791
Just like that, bad boys.

771
01:01:46,791 --> 01:01:51,083
The boss did say dead or alive.

772
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,625
Are you in a hurry?

773
01:01:54,208 --> 01:01:55,166
No.

774
01:01:56,083 --> 01:01:57,458
Then…

775
01:02:00,166 --> 01:02:04,833
maybe you can stay with me for a while.

776
01:02:10,625 --> 01:02:14,250
Your voice sounds familiar to me.

777
01:02:32,833 --> 01:02:34,875
You cunt! I’ll kill you!

778
01:02:55,083 --> 01:02:56,375
Where's my son?

779
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:00,166
Where?!

780
01:03:01,583 --> 01:03:02,791
Good luck finding him.

781
01:03:04,916 --> 01:03:06,041
You son of a bitch!

782
01:03:21,666 --> 01:03:25,500
Yes, boss? Yes, I'm with them.

783
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:29,208
I will deliver it to you, boss!
Just leave it to me!

784
01:03:29,708 --> 01:03:32,750
You have nothing to worry about.
I'll handle it!

785
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:34,541
What the--

786
01:03:35,208 --> 01:03:36,333
What the hell is this?!

787
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:42,416
Smells like piss!

788
01:03:43,333 --> 01:03:47,958
Son, can you hear me?
I'm almost out of battery.

789
01:03:50,541 --> 01:03:53,000
You said you didn’t
talk to your mom, right?

790
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:59,166
Don't you know that lying
to the police is a crime, huh?!

791
01:04:03,416 --> 01:04:07,375
Sir, sir, please help me.

792
01:04:07,458 --> 01:04:10,625
Get out! Get out!

793
01:04:10,708 --> 01:04:14,666
- Can we please talk, please, sir?
- Yes! Let's talk out here! Get off!

794
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,083
- Get out!
- I don’t want to!

795
01:04:16,166 --> 01:04:17,166
Get out!

796
01:04:33,291 --> 01:04:34,333
Kneel!

797
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:38,041
Kneel!

798
01:04:42,708 --> 01:04:43,708
Son!

799
01:04:44,666 --> 01:04:45,666
Son! Tell them…

800
01:04:48,791 --> 01:04:50,083
Give him the phone.

801
01:04:52,416 --> 01:04:54,541
Ask your mother where she is.

802
01:05:00,541 --> 01:05:02,500
Mom, where are you?

803
01:05:02,583 --> 01:05:06,083
Son, tell them, I'm… I'm…

804
01:05:09,541 --> 01:05:11,083
Tell them I'm at the house
of the Mayor's ex-lover.

805
01:05:11,166 --> 01:05:12,250
Mom, where are you?

806
01:05:16,916 --> 01:05:19,083
At the Mayor's ex-lover’s place.

807
01:05:21,291 --> 01:05:24,291
Ah, okay. All right.

808
01:05:24,375 --> 01:05:25,500
Say your goodbyes.

809
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:28,541
What?

810
01:05:29,333 --> 01:05:31,125
I said,

811
01:05:31,208 --> 01:05:33,041
say your goodbyes.

812
01:05:34,833 --> 01:05:38,125
Son, tell them not to hurt you.

813
01:05:38,208 --> 01:05:39,666
I'm right here.

814
01:05:39,750 --> 01:05:41,333
Mom, they said I should say goodbye.

815
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:43,541
I'm right here!

816
01:05:45,291 --> 01:05:46,208
Ma.

817
01:05:46,291 --> 01:05:47,875
Son?

818
01:05:47,958 --> 01:05:49,208
I love you so much.

819
01:05:49,291 --> 01:05:54,250
I'm sorry if I wasn't a good son.

820
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,500
Enzo?

821
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:16,666
Son?

822
01:06:29,416 --> 01:06:30,541
Son?

823
01:07:02,666 --> 01:07:03,708
Weak shit!

824
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:05,208
Got you good, huh?

825
01:07:05,875 --> 01:07:07,041
Get the keys.

826
01:07:14,791 --> 01:07:16,291
I think that’s enough.

827
01:07:16,375 --> 01:07:17,666
He’s not going to spill the beans.

828
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:18,958
Look how terrified he is.

829
01:07:19,041 --> 01:07:20,333
Let's go to Emmy.

830
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:23,375
Let the boy go.

831
01:07:23,458 --> 01:07:24,500
Wait a minute.

832
01:07:28,291 --> 01:07:29,541
This, too.

833
01:07:29,625 --> 01:07:30,541
What's that?

834
01:07:32,583 --> 01:07:35,375
- You know…
- We didn't agree to that.

835
01:07:35,958 --> 01:07:37,416
Do we have to discuss everything?

836
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:40,000
Don’t be like that, man.
We're not killing anyone.

837
01:07:40,083 --> 01:07:42,041
Morales, this is how I roll. Step aside.

838
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:43,208
Pastor!

839
01:07:44,333 --> 01:07:45,750
I'm in a hurry.

840
01:07:48,750 --> 01:07:50,000
SAD 909
PERLAS NG SILANGAN

841
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:33,333
Come on.

842
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:37,291
Enzo, come on.

843
01:08:41,375 --> 01:08:42,333
Let's go.

844
01:08:43,791 --> 01:08:44,833
Let's go.

845
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:56,625
POLICE

846
01:09:07,250 --> 01:09:08,416
Hello?

847
01:09:09,458 --> 01:09:10,625
Son?

848
01:09:10,708 --> 01:09:11,791
Mom?

849
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:15,166
Enzo?

850
01:09:17,583 --> 01:09:19,708
My son, listen to me.

851
01:09:20,666 --> 01:09:24,458
Tell them I'll do everything they want,

852
01:09:25,583 --> 01:09:27,625
as long as they don't hurt you.

853
01:09:28,291 --> 01:09:30,250
Tell them that. Tell them.

854
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,750
Morales saved me.

855
01:09:33,625 --> 01:09:35,083
Mom.

856
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:37,166
What are we going to do?

857
01:09:40,583 --> 01:09:42,333
Who’s giving you orders?

858
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,125
I don't know.

859
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:52,375
Mom, let's meet at Edraline's place.

860
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:34,958
Ladies…

861
01:10:36,291 --> 01:10:38,375
which way is Edraline's house?

862
01:10:39,416 --> 01:10:40,916
Just go straight ahead.

863
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:43,750
Go up the slope there.

864
01:10:53,958 --> 01:10:54,958
I can't.

865
01:10:59,250 --> 01:11:00,416
I can't do that to your mom.

866
01:11:06,833 --> 01:11:08,291
I owe her so much.

867
01:11:11,625 --> 01:11:13,416
On the outside, she seems strict.

868
01:11:16,500 --> 01:11:17,416
But…

869
01:11:19,958 --> 01:11:21,500
But her support for me is immense.

870
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,791
Especially when…

871
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:30,125
What?

872
01:11:30,208 --> 01:11:31,041
When…

873
01:11:33,791 --> 01:11:35,291
When I told her that…

874
01:11:44,291 --> 01:11:45,750
that I’m not into women.

875
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:48,916
Ah.

876
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:55,333
She's the only one who knows.

877
01:12:01,208 --> 01:12:02,875
At work…

878
01:12:06,208 --> 01:12:07,500
they will never understand me.

879
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,916
Since I was a kid,
this has been my dream job.

880
01:12:21,916 --> 01:12:23,375
I feel that support too.

881
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:26,916
When people find out my dad is American,

882
01:12:30,291 --> 01:12:32,625
only Mom gives me strength.

883
01:12:37,541 --> 01:12:38,875
When I told your mom,

884
01:12:41,541 --> 01:12:42,916
you know what she said to me?

885
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:48,375
Nothing.

886
01:12:50,875 --> 01:12:52,166
She just hugged me quietly.

887
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:01,708
Enzo, I love your mom so much.

888
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:08,125
I'll out you to everyone.

889
01:13:11,958 --> 01:13:13,333
You dumb ass.

890
01:13:15,583 --> 01:13:17,000
Want me to really shoot you?

891
01:13:17,083 --> 01:13:18,416
Hey!

892
01:13:18,500 --> 01:13:19,958
Chill. I’m just kidding!

893
01:13:31,958 --> 01:13:33,125
Open the gate.

894
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:35,416
Get the vans ready.

895
01:13:39,416 --> 01:13:40,291
That's good to go.

896
01:13:47,041 --> 01:13:48,208
Sir, there's someone here.

897
01:13:54,375 --> 01:13:55,375
Teacher Emmy.

898
01:14:01,333 --> 01:14:04,375
I'm not here to cause trouble.
I need your help.

899
01:14:06,041 --> 01:14:07,750
I know you, Teacher Emmy.

900
01:14:07,833 --> 01:14:09,291
You know me?

901
01:14:10,833 --> 01:14:12,916
In fact, I'm so worried about you.

902
01:14:14,166 --> 01:14:17,291
I heard Hidalgo's forces attacked.

903
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:20,041
That mayor is a monster.

904
01:14:22,333 --> 01:14:24,541
Come in. Come in.

905
01:14:33,666 --> 01:14:37,375
Do you want us
to remove those handcuffs on you?

906
01:14:38,166 --> 01:14:40,500
I'll find someone
who knows how to unlock them.

907
01:14:42,333 --> 01:14:43,541
Or get a saw.

908
01:14:53,541 --> 01:14:55,541
Oops! Be careful.

909
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:57,541
That's expensive!
It costs two million pesos!

910
01:14:58,416 --> 01:14:59,333
What?

911
01:15:00,375 --> 01:15:01,750
Two million?

912
01:15:04,125 --> 01:15:06,166
That's 16 years of my salary.

913
01:15:09,125 --> 01:15:10,125
Wow.

914
01:15:17,791 --> 01:15:20,000
It's good you came straight here.

915
01:15:21,125 --> 01:15:23,500
Did you go anywhere else
before this place?

916
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:26,208
No, sir.

917
01:15:34,750 --> 01:15:36,500
Do you like the artwork?

918
01:15:39,250 --> 01:15:40,583
I'm an art collector.

919
01:15:44,666 --> 01:15:45,750
Come in.

920
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:54,000
Come in, Teacher Emmy.

921
01:16:13,708 --> 01:16:14,666
Please, sit down.

922
01:16:24,583 --> 01:16:25,666
Have a drink.

923
01:16:29,708 --> 01:16:31,750
Your bruises are quite bad, aren't they?

924
01:16:32,416 --> 01:16:34,250
Do you want us to clean them?

925
01:16:36,416 --> 01:16:39,083
No need, sir, I'll do it myself.

926
01:16:39,166 --> 01:16:40,833
Do you have any alcohol?

927
01:16:41,375 --> 01:16:42,500
Sure, just a moment.

928
01:16:49,458 --> 01:16:50,375
Here.

929
01:16:55,833 --> 01:16:59,083
It's good you came straight here.

930
01:17:00,041 --> 01:17:01,958
You didn't ask for help from anyone else?

931
01:17:03,875 --> 01:17:05,083
No, sir.

932
01:17:08,041 --> 01:17:10,666
Glad you survived.

933
01:17:12,541 --> 01:17:15,000
You know, that mayor is really something.

934
01:17:19,708 --> 01:17:23,833
You know, Teacher Emmy,
this is why we really need change.

935
01:17:24,666 --> 01:17:28,166
For the betterment of most people's lives,

936
01:17:28,250 --> 01:17:33,041
we need leaders
with political will and vision,

937
01:17:33,125 --> 01:17:35,125
especially for the poor.

938
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:43,958
I really admire
your courage, Teacher Emmy.

939
01:17:47,541 --> 01:17:49,875
I'm just doing my job.

940
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:52,625
It's not just that. You know…

941
01:18:07,375 --> 01:18:09,416
for bringing that box?

942
01:18:10,916 --> 01:18:12,833
Ah, no, sir.

943
01:18:12,916 --> 01:18:16,250
Maybe we should just surrender this
to the governor's office.

944
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:17,208
No.

945
01:18:21,333 --> 01:18:22,333
Sir?

946
01:18:25,375 --> 01:18:27,333
We'll take care of that box.

947
01:18:28,958 --> 01:18:31,500
Once the counting is done and I win.

948
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:37,458
All I need you to do is to certify
that the box hasn't been tampered with.

949
01:18:38,083 --> 01:18:39,625
We'll take care of it.

950
01:18:46,916 --> 01:18:48,458
You know, Teacher Emmy.

951
01:18:52,333 --> 01:18:55,041
People like you should be rewarded.

952
01:18:57,916 --> 01:18:59,125
How much?

953
01:19:02,333 --> 01:19:04,375
PHP50,000?

954
01:19:08,041 --> 01:19:09,000
Sir…

955
01:19:09,708 --> 01:19:10,750
that's too little.

956
01:19:12,791 --> 01:19:17,250
Well then, let’s make it PHP75,000.

957
01:19:20,041 --> 01:19:21,791
PHP75,000?

958
01:19:23,166 --> 01:19:24,375
Wow. That’s generous, sir.

959
01:19:24,958 --> 01:19:26,333
I understand what you mean,

960
01:19:27,666 --> 01:19:30,250
and I really idolize you.

961
01:19:31,250 --> 01:19:37,541
I'll just tell people
that someone took this box,

962
01:19:37,625 --> 01:19:40,541
then it got lost.

963
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:41,625
Something like that.

964
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:45,458
And it will be our secret.

965
01:19:49,541 --> 01:19:52,625
You know, Teacher Emmy, you're smart.

966
01:19:54,958 --> 01:19:59,083
You know, my reputation is important
to me and that would be a big help.

967
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,125
Why don't you work for me?

968
01:20:06,458 --> 01:20:07,666
For you?

969
01:20:09,291 --> 01:20:11,416
Oh, sir, I'd love that.

970
01:20:12,416 --> 01:20:13,666
I really idolize you!

971
01:20:13,750 --> 01:20:15,458
I voted for you.

972
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:19,041
Sir, I'm starving.

973
01:20:19,125 --> 01:20:20,125
Sir…

974
01:20:20,208 --> 01:20:21,666
I'm really, really hungry.

975
01:20:22,500 --> 01:20:23,916
Maybe there's…

976
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:26,708
I'm sorry. I forgot, yeah.

977
01:20:26,791 --> 01:20:28,750
Okay, I'll have something
prepared. Excuse me.

978
01:20:30,958 --> 01:20:32,166
Berto!

979
01:20:52,333 --> 01:20:54,000
POLICE

980
01:20:57,541 --> 01:20:59,166
DON'T GO TO EDRALINE. ENEMY

981
01:21:00,083 --> 01:21:01,791
Sir, what's your business here?

982
01:21:01,875 --> 01:21:04,166
Ah, were looking for…

983
01:21:04,250 --> 01:21:05,375
Ceryaka, sir!

984
01:21:05,458 --> 01:21:06,625
Who?

985
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:11,708
Ah, is this the house
of Ceryaka Rimpampanita?

986
01:21:12,458 --> 01:21:13,750
Brother, they're asking for a Ceryaka?

987
01:21:13,833 --> 01:21:15,208
She's not here, sir.

988
01:21:15,291 --> 01:21:16,666
There's no Ceryaka here.

989
01:21:16,750 --> 01:21:19,000
Oh, sorry, sir, we might have
the wrong address.

990
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,291
All right, we'll be leaving.

991
01:21:20,958 --> 01:21:21,791
Sorry about that.

992
01:21:21,875 --> 01:21:23,041
- Okay, okay.
- Have a good day, sir.

993
01:21:23,125 --> 01:21:24,041
We’re leaving?

994
01:21:24,125 --> 01:21:25,541
Just turn around.

995
01:21:25,625 --> 01:21:26,708
Okay, okay, all right.

996
01:21:29,250 --> 01:21:30,625
Who is Ceryaka?

997
01:21:43,291 --> 01:21:45,000
Sir, what food did you get?

998
01:21:45,083 --> 01:21:47,541
I ordered something special for you.

999
01:21:49,208 --> 01:21:50,625
Sir, can I have more water?

1000
01:21:58,416 --> 01:22:01,208
Hey, is that going to take long?

1001
01:22:02,291 --> 01:22:05,333
Sorry, boss. It overheated.

1002
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:09,625
So, what now? Who can help us?

1003
01:22:10,375 --> 01:22:12,250
Honestly, I don't know.

1004
01:22:14,666 --> 01:22:15,625
How about Hidalgo?

1005
01:22:17,208 --> 01:22:19,083
But she's a murderer too, right?

1006
01:22:19,666 --> 01:22:21,458
She had Arnold killed…

1007
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:25,833
How's your steak?

1008
01:22:26,458 --> 01:22:27,458
Yummy.

1009
01:22:28,041 --> 01:22:29,708
The exquisite flavor of privilege.

1010
01:22:32,791 --> 01:22:36,666
Sorry for the wait.
I'm still looking for a bastard saw.

1011
01:22:37,666 --> 01:22:40,583
The saws here can't cut through metal.

1012
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:47,250
Oh, Mayor, since I'll be working for you,

1013
01:22:47,333 --> 01:22:51,250
maybe you could fill me in
on your plans for your first year.

1014
01:22:53,250 --> 01:22:56,708
You know, don't call me mayor yet.
It's not official.

1015
01:22:57,458 --> 01:22:58,666
Just call me Ed.

1016
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:00,833
They're on their way, Mayor.

1017
01:23:02,291 --> 01:23:03,333
Thank you.

1018
01:23:08,125 --> 01:23:09,916
I have many plans.

1019
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:15,583
First of all,
I want to clean up the city hall.

1020
01:23:15,666 --> 01:23:16,666
Yes!

1021
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:18,958
You really should clean that up.

1022
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:21,875
The Hidalgo’s regime
is so dirty and corrupt!

1023
01:23:21,958 --> 01:23:23,333
She’s so shameless.

1024
01:23:23,958 --> 01:23:25,583
Yeah, sure.

1025
01:23:26,208 --> 01:23:29,500
But have you seen
the restroom in the mayor's office?

1026
01:23:30,708 --> 01:23:31,958
Yuck!

1027
01:23:34,375 --> 01:23:36,166
It's really good
that you won as mayor, right?

1028
01:23:36,250 --> 01:23:39,750
Even if the election was so chaotic.

1029
01:23:43,916 --> 01:23:46,500
That's really how elections are here.

1030
01:23:55,666 --> 01:23:59,666
If it's broken, why do we still do it?

1031
01:24:01,916 --> 01:24:04,333
Actually, that's an old formula.

1032
01:24:05,833 --> 01:24:09,791
Even the kings in ancient times knew this.

1033
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:17,500
Oh, wow! This already exists?

1034
01:24:20,958 --> 01:24:23,791
Sis. Hey, sis? Are you still mad?

1035
01:24:24,750 --> 01:24:26,041
How much is this?

1036
01:24:26,125 --> 01:24:27,333
Hunty, you know I’m broke, right?

1037
01:24:27,416 --> 01:24:28,791
- Hunty, you know I’m broke, right?
- I’ll buy one.

1038
01:24:29,541 --> 01:24:32,041
And it's not a big deal, sis.
It's just a victory party.

1039
01:24:32,125 --> 01:24:35,458
The voting is over.
Nothing can change the results.

1040
01:24:35,541 --> 01:24:37,541
This looks nice, doesn't it?

1041
01:24:37,625 --> 01:24:39,791
Hunty, you don't understand me.

1042
01:24:40,416 --> 01:24:42,333
Sis, I need the money.

1043
01:24:43,125 --> 01:24:46,333
Bravo! Bravo.

1044
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:50,125
If I was not, you know…

1045
01:24:50,208 --> 01:24:53,708
If I were rich, of course,
I wouldn't have taken that gig, right?

1046
01:24:53,791 --> 01:24:57,208
And then what? You'll complain
about the stinky sewer in this town?

1047
01:24:58,583 --> 01:25:02,041
Shouldn’t they use our taxes
for cleaning that up?

1048
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:06,666
Girl! We’re filthy queens…

1049
01:25:08,416 --> 01:25:10,583
but we shouldn't be living
in a pigsty nation.

1050
01:25:10,666 --> 01:25:12,375
Babe, Joselito.

1051
01:25:12,458 --> 01:25:14,041
Erhmengard, dear.

1052
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:15,125
Help us.

1053
01:25:15,208 --> 01:25:16,333
Wait!

1054
01:25:18,541 --> 01:25:21,208
Just give the people their basic needs.

1055
01:25:24,208 --> 01:25:27,208
phone load, a little cash.

1056
01:25:28,333 --> 01:25:30,375
Give them something to enjoy.

1057
01:25:41,458 --> 01:25:44,166
Jimbo, Aunt Melissa?!

1058
01:25:48,458 --> 01:25:49,500
Jimbo?

1059
01:26:43,291 --> 01:26:44,416
Enzo, let's go.

1060
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:47,000
Your mom needs you.

1061
01:27:06,583 --> 01:27:08,708
Mayor, that's you!

1062
01:27:18,166 --> 01:27:19,333
You’re right.

1063
01:27:21,083 --> 01:27:24,375
You’re right. That’s me, no one else.

1064
01:27:24,958 --> 01:27:27,541
No one else, just you.

1065
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:36,125
Mayor, someone's coming.

1066
01:27:37,375 --> 01:27:38,291
Thank you.

1067
01:27:40,583 --> 01:27:42,125
Let's open that box up.

1068
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:47,083
I want to see your ballot.
Your vote for me.

1069
01:27:49,541 --> 01:27:50,541
Enzo.

1070
01:27:51,041 --> 01:27:53,625
What you're asking isn't easy for me.

1071
01:27:57,250 --> 01:27:58,583
I know those people.

1072
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:04,958
They'll kill Emmy.

1073
01:28:07,458 --> 01:28:08,833
Next year,

1074
01:28:10,416 --> 01:28:12,125
you might be mourning two people.

1075
01:28:17,166 --> 01:28:18,541
Comrades!

1076
01:28:19,375 --> 01:28:21,166
Let's call all the townspeople!

1077
01:28:22,000 --> 01:28:25,625
Call the workers,
laborers, farmers, teachers!

1078
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:28,208
Call your families and relatives!

1079
01:28:29,833 --> 01:28:30,916
And most of all,

1080
01:28:31,625 --> 01:28:34,041
call all the gays!

1081
01:28:36,041 --> 01:28:37,708
Ouch! Sir, it's getting hot.

1082
01:28:37,791 --> 01:28:39,791
Sorry.

1083
01:28:39,875 --> 01:28:41,125
Do it properly.

1084
01:28:42,166 --> 01:28:43,375
Hurry up!

1085
01:28:51,625 --> 01:28:54,541
Ouch, ouch, ouch! Sir, it really burns.

1086
01:28:54,625 --> 01:28:56,208
I'll do it! Go away!

1087
01:28:57,333 --> 01:29:00,750
Ah, Mayor. What are your plans again?

1088
01:29:02,541 --> 01:29:04,625
What plans? Didn't we talk about that?

1089
01:29:05,125 --> 01:29:07,125
Huh? You're just repeating it.

1090
01:29:07,208 --> 01:29:09,208
Are you just pulling my leg?

1091
01:29:09,291 --> 01:29:11,958
Bring Teacher Emmy out!

1092
01:29:12,041 --> 01:29:14,458
Bring Teacher Emmy out!

1093
01:29:14,541 --> 01:29:17,083
Bring Teacher Emmy out!

1094
01:29:17,166 --> 01:29:19,708
Bring Teacher Emmy out!

1095
01:29:19,791 --> 01:29:21,291
- What did you do?
- Ouch!

1096
01:29:25,083 --> 01:29:28,625
Man-whore! Bring Teacher Emmy out!

1097
01:29:28,708 --> 01:29:30,875
Bring Teacher Emmy out!

1098
01:29:30,958 --> 01:29:32,916
Ex-man whore, sis.

1099
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:38,125
Candidate, formerly known
as a man-whore, release Ma’am Emmy!

1100
01:29:38,208 --> 01:29:40,958
Mayor, we can't kill them all.
We are overrun.

1101
01:29:41,875 --> 01:29:43,166
Too many of them.

1102
01:29:43,250 --> 01:29:44,750
Too many witnesses.

1103
01:29:47,291 --> 01:29:50,208
- Why are you touching me?
- Let me go!

1104
01:29:54,625 --> 01:29:56,750
Sis, help!

1105
01:29:58,250 --> 01:29:59,500
You know, Ed,

1106
01:30:01,416 --> 01:30:04,958
you can deny killing my nephew and cousin.

1107
01:30:07,291 --> 01:30:10,333
You can deny that and be acquitted.

1108
01:30:10,958 --> 01:30:12,500
If your lawyer is good.

1109
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:16,375
Far too many people
know I'm here with you.

1110
01:30:17,666 --> 01:30:21,375
That's why I'm telling you,
if you do anything to me,

1111
01:30:22,083 --> 01:30:24,208
you'll go to prison for life.

1112
01:30:27,625 --> 01:30:29,125
I'll kill you then.

1113
01:30:36,208 --> 01:30:38,416
How many of these
would-be kings you talk about

1114
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:40,458
have been ousted or beheaded?

1115
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:44,541
Wake up, Emmy. This is the Philippines.

1116
01:30:45,666 --> 01:30:51,208
There won't be any ousting
or beheadings unless people starve.

1117
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:54,083
Thank God, we don't have that.

1118
01:30:55,375 --> 01:30:59,000
As long as there are people
sending dollars from abroad…

1119
01:30:59,083 --> 01:31:02,625
As long as there are generous people
like me during elections…

1120
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:07,666
No one will go hungry,
no one will run out of load,

1121
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:09,041
and nothing will change.

1122
01:31:09,583 --> 01:31:13,166
Sir, far too many are hungry.
You just don't know it.

1123
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:14,916
They just don't know it yet.

1124
01:31:16,125 --> 01:31:18,125
Don't be a hypocrite, Emmy.

1125
01:31:19,916 --> 01:31:21,666
The only reason you can refuse money

1126
01:31:22,583 --> 01:31:26,166
is because your kid gets dollars
from his American daddy.

1127
01:31:26,833 --> 01:31:27,833
Isn't that right?

1128
01:31:28,416 --> 01:31:31,541
You talk like you have principles.

1129
01:31:33,125 --> 01:31:36,458
You think that because you're a teacher,
you know everything.

1130
01:31:37,458 --> 01:31:38,500
You're just a teacher.

1131
01:31:41,541 --> 01:31:43,916
Oh, well, fine. We lost the fight.

1132
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:46,791
But we’re not fighting the same battle.

1133
01:31:47,708 --> 01:31:50,750
Congrats. You guys have won.
Fine! Take it all!

1134
01:31:50,833 --> 01:31:53,916
All that you've stolen
and will continue to steal shamelessly.

1135
01:31:54,666 --> 01:31:56,916
Go buy justice for all I care.

1136
01:31:57,541 --> 01:31:59,291
But I know one day, all of you will pay.

1137
01:31:59,791 --> 01:32:02,541
Maybe not now or in the next election.

1138
01:32:03,708 --> 01:32:04,916
That day will come.

1139
01:32:05,625 --> 01:32:07,625
I will not lose hope.

1140
01:32:10,250 --> 01:32:11,750
That's why I'm a teacher.

1141
01:32:12,708 --> 01:32:13,875
Not "just" a teacher.

1142
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:16,125
And you know what, Edraline?

1143
01:32:16,208 --> 01:32:18,125
My hope doesn’t come from you.

1144
01:32:20,166 --> 01:32:21,375
It’s from them.

1145
01:32:58,958 --> 01:33:00,791
Edraline, get up!

1146
01:33:00,875 --> 01:33:02,208
Stop with your wheelchair nonsense!

1147
01:33:02,291 --> 01:33:03,791
Stand up!

1148
01:33:03,875 --> 01:33:07,541
You can’t fool me. Stand up! There you go.

1149
01:33:12,166 --> 01:33:16,250
Oh, wait, Edraline. I forgot to tell you.

1150
01:33:16,333 --> 01:33:18,041
- What is it?
- I’ll be a witness against you.

1151
01:33:18,125 --> 01:33:20,833
My son and Officer SPO1 will testify

1152
01:33:20,916 --> 01:33:22,125
against you.

1153
01:33:22,208 --> 01:33:23,666
Oh, no. What now?

1154
01:33:23,750 --> 01:33:26,958
That's multiple murder charges,
a life sentence.

1155
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,208
Ha!

1156
01:33:43,875 --> 01:33:46,375
Astounding! Perfect timing, madam.

1157
01:33:46,458 --> 01:33:49,500
Props to you.
You’re like the police in soap operas!

1158
01:33:49,583 --> 01:33:52,458
You all show up after the scene is over.

1159
01:33:56,083 --> 01:33:57,750
Watch. She'll try to make a scene.

1160
01:33:58,291 --> 01:34:02,333
Mayor! A rich person
already owns this land.

1161
01:34:02,416 --> 01:34:04,500
You can’t turn it
into a subdivision anymore.

1162
01:34:06,541 --> 01:34:07,375
I came here to--

1163
01:34:07,458 --> 01:34:08,708
Wait, Mayor.

1164
01:34:09,250 --> 01:34:10,541
Did you win?

1165
01:34:10,625 --> 01:34:12,958
Oh, yes!

1166
01:34:13,041 --> 01:34:18,416
Even if you add
those 15 votes, I'm still ahead.

1167
01:34:18,500 --> 01:34:23,500
Thank you so much
for protecting your vote for me.

1168
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:25,791
I didn't vote for you.

1169
01:34:27,291 --> 01:34:31,500
Ah, no wonder you went to Edraline.

1170
01:34:32,916 --> 01:34:34,708
I didn't vote for him either.

1171
01:34:35,291 --> 01:34:36,125
I abstained.

1172
01:34:38,166 --> 01:34:41,708
You did all this, but you voted abstain?

1173
01:34:43,666 --> 01:34:48,625
In the three years
between elections, we had no voice.

1174
01:34:48,708 --> 01:34:52,250
But today, my voice is as loud as yours.

1175
01:34:52,333 --> 01:34:55,083
That's why I'll fight
for my right to speak.

1176
01:34:55,166 --> 01:34:57,583
Even if what I want to say is you and him,

1177
01:34:58,166 --> 01:34:59,916
neither of you are worthy to lead.

1178
01:35:00,541 --> 01:35:02,166
She’s right.

1179
01:35:03,291 --> 01:35:04,583
Don’t I know you?

1180
01:35:07,750 --> 01:35:08,916
You know my husband.

1181
01:35:12,416 --> 01:35:16,833
Ah, Emmy. I need to ask you for a favor.

1182
01:35:22,541 --> 01:35:25,583
What will I get
if I give you what you want?

1183
01:35:26,750 --> 01:35:28,291
Whatever you want.

1184
01:35:32,083 --> 01:35:33,916
Well, if you say so.

1185
01:35:35,208 --> 01:35:36,666
A good day to everyone!

1186
01:35:37,916 --> 01:35:42,500
Our town has been declared an election
hotspot due to the events of 2007.

1187
01:35:42,583 --> 01:35:43,958
Workers are celebrating

1188
01:35:45,041 --> 01:35:48,250
the third year anniversary
of the collective bargaining agreement

1189
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:52,208
generously signed by Mayor Hidalgo,
raising the wages of her workers.

1190
01:35:53,083 --> 01:35:57,041
This and many other stories when we return
after a few words from our sponsors…

1191
01:35:58,375 --> 01:36:02,333
As God is my witness,
I didn't steal anything.

1192
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:05,916
I deny all the allegations.

1193
01:36:07,750 --> 01:36:09,500
God knows I am innocent.

1194
01:36:15,083 --> 01:36:17,750
I am a victim of dirty politics.

1195
01:36:38,916 --> 01:36:41,083
Even though he’s in prison

1196
01:36:41,166 --> 01:36:43,083
He’s running in this election

1197
01:36:43,166 --> 01:36:47,875
Edraline, Edraline, will keep on fighting

1198
01:36:47,958 --> 01:36:50,166
Gentlemanly, brave, and will keep fighting

1199
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:52,250
True heroes lose at the start

1200
01:36:52,333 --> 01:36:54,875
Ripe fruits get stoned

1201
01:36:54,958 --> 01:36:58,375
2010, let's shade Edraline

1202
01:37:00,708 --> 01:37:01,833
How are you?

1203
01:37:07,583 --> 01:37:10,041
Edraline really has a thick face, huh?

1204
01:37:10,125 --> 01:37:12,333
Can you believe he’s running
a campaign from prison?

1205
01:37:13,250 --> 01:37:15,375
Good thing we have one decent candidate.

1206
01:37:16,041 --> 01:37:17,125
Congrats to them.

1207
01:37:18,458 --> 01:37:20,750
I heard they’re second in the survey.

1208
01:37:20,833 --> 01:37:23,333
Might even get first place out of eight.

1209
01:37:23,416 --> 01:37:25,416
Clearly, they know how to organize.

1210
01:37:26,291 --> 01:37:27,708
Which voting precinct are you?

1211
01:37:28,458 --> 01:37:29,666
San Isidro.

1212
01:37:30,875 --> 01:37:32,791
Emmy, you already know,

1213
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:36,250
I don't really believe
in real change during elections.

1214
01:37:36,875 --> 01:37:38,958
It doesn’t happen in the polling booth.

1215
01:37:39,625 --> 01:37:41,250
It happens on the streets.

1216
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,791
The only reason I'm voting now
is because of her.

1217
01:37:48,125 --> 01:37:51,041
#3 IN THE BALLOT

1218
01:37:51,125 --> 01:37:53,666
Excuse me! Excuse me.
Future councilor passing through!

1219
01:37:57,083 --> 01:37:58,791
Are you on the way to vote?

1220
01:37:58,875 --> 01:38:00,250
Oh, no.

1221
01:38:00,333 --> 01:38:02,625
I just got lost while buying vinegar.

1222
01:38:03,458 --> 01:38:05,458
Of course, obviously, yes,
I'm going to vote. What do you think?!

1223
01:38:05,541 --> 01:38:06,625
There's a camera.

1224
01:38:06,708 --> 01:38:08,500
There's a camera?!

1225
01:38:10,041 --> 01:38:14,375
Hello! Yes, my Mom, my Dad, yes.

1226
01:38:14,458 --> 01:38:19,125
Hello, my lovers. Yes,
I can't name you all, but I'm here now.

1227
01:38:19,208 --> 01:38:21,708
Yes, I will vote.

1228
01:38:21,791 --> 01:38:24,958
Why is it important to vote today?

1229
01:38:34,208 --> 01:38:40,833
I do believe,
until the people win the struggle,

1230
01:38:41,583 --> 01:38:43,250
we should vote.

1231
01:38:43,333 --> 01:38:46,666
Vote for pro-people candidates.

1232
01:38:47,250 --> 01:38:50,208
That’s what we need to do.

1233
01:39:01,041 --> 01:39:02,041
Good morning, Principal.

1234
01:39:05,666 --> 01:39:07,708
Good morning.

1235
01:39:35,791 --> 01:39:37,250
Bro, how are you?

1236
01:39:38,541 --> 01:39:39,708
How are you, Attorney?

1237
01:39:40,333 --> 01:39:44,000
Wow, I just passed the law entrance exam,
and you’re calling me "attorney"?

1238
01:39:45,041 --> 01:39:46,958
SPO1 is really something!

1239
01:39:47,041 --> 01:39:48,458
SPO1?! I'm not a cop anymore!

1240
01:39:48,541 --> 01:39:50,041
Isn’t it obvious?

1241
01:39:50,125 --> 01:39:52,666
I know. I just want to annoy you.

1242
01:39:53,250 --> 01:39:54,958
Hey, are you busy later?

1243
01:39:55,041 --> 01:39:56,625
Not really, why?

1244
01:39:57,166 --> 01:40:00,416
I want to watch an indie movie.

1245
01:40:00,500 --> 01:40:03,625
They say it's fun,
and there are many cute guys.

1246
01:40:03,708 --> 01:40:05,291
- I know you like that.
- So what?

1247
01:40:05,833 --> 01:40:07,291
You're really crazy.

1248
01:40:10,000 --> 01:40:11,958
Hey! That's illegal!

1249
01:40:15,916 --> 01:40:18,708
Sir! Sir! Please arrest him.

1250
01:40:52,541 --> 01:40:55,625
Commission on Elections, what do we do?
Your machine isn’t working?

1251
01:40:56,791 --> 01:40:59,041
We need to go back to manual.

1252
01:41:03,125 --> 01:41:07,041
You all witnessed
that even I once fell from grace.

1253
01:41:19,291 --> 01:41:21,166
Our cry during the campaign.

1254
01:41:21,250 --> 01:41:23,375
If there's no corruption,
there's no poverty!

1255
01:41:26,583 --> 01:41:30,291
I am really the strongest candidate
because they all bash me.

1256
01:41:30,375 --> 01:41:33,291
My God. I hate drugs.

1257
01:41:33,375 --> 01:41:35,041
I have full confidence.

1258
01:41:38,125 --> 01:41:39,625
It never ends.

1259
01:41:43,958 --> 01:41:45,708
Son of a bitch.
