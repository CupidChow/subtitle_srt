95
00:10:09,245 --> 00:10:11,361
So you're taking the job, right?

96
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:14,027
I told you, I have always wanted to do this.

97
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:18,369
We are a family now, so why don't we go out for a company meal together?

98
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:19,495
Is that all right?

99
00:10:19,495 --> 00:10:21,605
Sounds good to me.

100
00:10:21,605 --> 00:10:24,823

101
00:10:24,823 --> 00:10:26,115
Okay.

102
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:34,717
What? How could he just leave like that in the middle of a conversation?

103
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,497
You should give up now. Seung Jun is a tough nut to crack.

104
00:10:38,497 --> 00:10:41,685
Even we have never had a meal with him.

105
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:47,728
I will bring him with me! Can you make the reservation?

106
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:50,397
What?

00:10:54,604 --> 00:10:56,222

00:10:57,950 --> 00:11:01,366
Do you have an important appointment or something? It's not like that, is it?

110
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:04,223
I'm sorry.

111
00:11:10,574 --> 00:11:12,594
Are you okay?

112
00:11:12,594 --> 00:11:14,056
Yes.

113
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,787
Seung Jun, you've never been to a company dinner before, have you?

114
00:11:18,787 --> 00:11:22,027
It's basic manners to at least show up.

115
00:11:22,975 --> 00:11:25,466
Just sit with us for half an hour.

116
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:27,759
Or just ten minutes?

117
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,176
Five minutes?

118
00:11:32,771 --> 00:11:35,688

119

123
00:11:56,072 --> 00:12:00,012
This is all thanks to you, Seung Jun. You should join us more often.

124
00:12:00,012 --> 00:12:04,442
Yes, we've worked together for more than two years, and we've never even had a meal together.

125
00:12:04,442 --> 00:12:06,559
I never mentioned it, but it hurt my feelings.

126
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,461
I practically had to drag him here.

127
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:12,527
Really? I wish I could have seen it!

128

can I ask you something?

132
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:32,903
Why do you wear those sunglasses? You are so handsome.

133
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:37,650
I'm not quite comfortable with people staring,

134
00:12:40,011 --> 00:12:42,115

00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:57,136
<i>- Aren't you ashamed to see the other members?

144
00:13:12,442 --> 00:13:15,015
Did I… do something wrong?

145
00:13:15,015 --> 00:13:16,629
No…

146
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,884
He was always a bit strange, but we didn't know how serious it was.

147
00:13:20,884 --> 00:13:27,476

If you pull it backward, you go forward.

If you want to stop,

154
00:14:21,322 --> 00:14:24,329
put the paddle away here.

00:14:46,452 --> 00:14:50,724

 - I just wanted to get a little tipsy.

158
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,421
Exactly...

00:14:52,421 --> 00:14:55,391
Why did you go to the get-together when you have panic disorder?

00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:58,221
I'm in trouble.

00:14:58,221 --> 00:14:59,608
What do you mean?

162
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,971

00:29:34,858 --> 00:29:37,336
<i>You're getting much better, you know.</i>

349
00:29:37,336 --> 00:29:39,363
<i>It's okay to wait with starting a new relationship</i>

350
00:29:39,363 --> 00:29:41,972
<i>until you've gotten over it completely.</i>

351
00:29:48,356 --> 00:29:50,495
<i>Relinquish your feelings for him for now.</i>

352
00:30:06,428 --> 00:30:09,115
Why are you in my head?

353
00:30:24,241 --> 00:30:26,316
Oh! Teacher...

354
00:30:26,316 --> 00:30:28,961
I… Uh…

355
00:30:30,936 --> 00:30:33,364
- You should have just said it. 
 - Right...

356
00:30:33,364 --> 00:30:36,568
Oh... Wait, was I that obvious?

357
00:30:36,568 --> 00:30:37,753
Here.

358
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,210
What?

359
00:30:40,598 --> 00:30:42,541
Ah, I didn't mean...

360
00:30:51,727 --> 00:30:55,094
Oh my, Chan Wu Oppa.

361
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:01,545
Excuse me, where is Teacher Seung Jun's room?

362
00:31:01,545 --> 00:31:03,274
Over there.

363
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:05,696
And where is that?

364
00:31:06,383 --> 00:31:08,570
Why would you ask m─

365
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:18,357
Ch-Chan...

366
00:31:18,357 --> 00:31:21,065
Chan... Chan Wu Oppa?

367
00:31:22,216 --> 00:31:23,509
Oh, yes, I'm...

368
00:31:23,509 --> 00:31:25,460
I'm Kim Chan Wu.

369
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,344
Your face is really the size of my fist.

370
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:30,287
I'm such a huge fan, I've been a fan since your debut.

371
00:31:30,287 --> 00:31:31,681
Ah, thank you.

372
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:33,185
Where's the vocal room?

373
00:31:33,185 --> 00:31:35,007
There.

374
00:31:45,113 --> 00:31:48,134
You look familiar. But...

375
00:31:48,134 --> 00:31:49,418
Don't I?

376
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:52,898
Have you been in one of my classes?

377
00:31:52,898 --> 00:31:54,458
No.

378
00:31:54,458 --> 00:31:57,429
O-Or... a different teacher?

379
00:31:59,111 --> 00:32:01,148
I'm Kim Chan Wu.

380
00:32:01,148 --> 00:32:03,842
I see, I'm Lee Seung Jun.

381
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:06,517
No, I'm... Kim Chan Wu.

382
00:32:07,255 --> 00:32:11,070
Okay… I'm... Lee Seung Jun.

383
00:32:17,042 --> 00:32:20,262
Oh! You're... You're a bit hot, right?

384
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,410
<i>[Café Simjeong]</i>

385
00:32:40,294 --> 00:32:42,004
It's him again.

386
00:32:42,004 --> 00:32:43,613
Again?

387
00:32:44,257 --> 00:32:45,657
Doesn't he have anything better to do?

388
00:32:45,657 --> 00:32:47,489
Who is he?

389
00:32:48,802 --> 00:32:50,837
You know, that guy who's hitting on Hyeon Ji.

390
00:32:50,837 --> 00:32:53,938
- He kept calling her up and even went to her house. 
 - What happened?

391
00:32:53,938 --> 00:32:56,775
She used to hate it so much, but they ended up dating.

392
00:32:56,775 --> 00:32:59,240
- Has it been a month now? 
 - Twenty days.

393
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,381
Boss, I have to go out for a minute.

394
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:04,786
He's here because he misses me.

395
00:33:04,786 --> 00:33:06,512
All right. Go ahead.

396
00:33:06,512 --> 00:33:08,645
I'll be right back.

397
00:33:11,033 --> 00:33:14,724
Does that actually work even when they're not interested?

398
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:18,398
I think it depends on the person.

399
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:22,403
If he seems fine, then it does paint the person in a different light.

400
00:33:22,403 --> 00:33:24,922
Hyeong, why are you so curious?

401
00:33:24,922 --> 00:33:28,262
- Are you... interested in Hyeon Ji? 
 - No!

402
00:33:28,942 --> 00:33:32,494
Don't even say that as a joke!

403
00:33:32,494 --> 00:33:33,955
Sorry!

404
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,954
Oh! I have to go!

405
00:33:39,954 --> 00:33:42,776
Hyeong. Hyeong!

406
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:47,952
I'm the only one actually working here.

407
00:33:56,672 --> 00:33:59,087
I don't know what's gotten into me lately.

408
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,865
Is something wrong?

409
00:34:06,865 --> 00:34:08,761
No, it's nothing.

410
00:34:10,494 --> 00:34:12,725
What was your group's name again?

411
00:34:12,725 --> 00:34:15,097
One Point!

412
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:16,974
I'll make sure to check out your performance clips.

413
00:34:16,974 --> 00:34:20,771
Oh! How... sweet of you.

414
00:34:20,771 --> 00:34:22,504
Remember to review what we talked about today.

415
00:34:22,504 --> 00:34:23,836
Of course.

416
00:34:23,836 --> 00:34:27,190
My singing is a bit lacking because I'm the dancer on the team.

417
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,845
But the company promised me a solo if I improved.

418
00:34:29,845 --> 00:34:32,531
You'll have to work harder then.

419
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:36,243
But won't you be lonely if you switch from a group to being a solo artist?

420
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:38,812
No... Not at all.

421
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:41,002
I can't wait for my solo debut.

422
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:44,833
Okay, good work today.

423
00:34:44,833 --> 00:34:46,562
Thank you!

424
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:48,663
What genre do you think I should do for my solo debut?

425
00:34:48,663 --> 00:34:52,090
I'm so torn between dance and ballad.

426
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,385
You need to practice first.

427
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:55,474
What song do you want to practice?

428
00:34:56,121 --> 00:34:57,757
Seung Jun!

429
00:34:59,183 --> 00:35:00,685
Who's that?

430
00:35:02,019 --> 00:35:03,449
I…

431
00:35:04,229 --> 00:35:05,561
Oh! I better get going.

432
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:08,165
No! You don't have to! Stay a little longer.

433
00:35:08,165 --> 00:35:10,302
Someone from my company is here to pick me up.

434
00:35:10,302 --> 00:35:12,388
I'll call you later.

435
00:35:19,536 --> 00:35:21,490
It's… over, isn't it?

436
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:26,834
Hello, CEO.

437
00:35:26,834 --> 00:35:28,831
Oh, here you are.

438
00:35:28,831 --> 00:35:30,932
Thank you.

439
00:35:33,175 --> 00:35:34,336
Well done.

440
00:35:34,336 --> 00:35:36,061
Thank you.

441
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:43,834
You can lean the chair back and relax.

442
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:45,126
It's all right, CEO.

443
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:46,962
It's an expensive car, so it's spacious.

444
00:35:46,962 --> 00:35:48,563
Thank you for coming to pick me up.

445
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,065
I'll pick you up every once in a while.

446
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,276
Really? Thank you!

447
00:35:52,276 --> 00:35:55,329
Oh, right! How was class today?

448
00:35:55,329 --> 00:35:57,507
Teacher Seung Jun is really sweet.

449
00:35:57,507 --> 00:35:59,165
Yes?

450
00:36:10,232 --> 00:36:11,593
Would you…

451
00:36:11,593 --> 00:36:13,240
like to sit for a moment?

452
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,545
Yes…

453
00:36:27,015 --> 00:36:31,052
I thought about you all day, Seung Jun.

454
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:36,697
How I must have made you uncomfortable by that sudden visit.

455
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:38,515
And how I'm sorry for making you go to that get-together,

456
00:36:38,515 --> 00:36:40,477
when you don't even like those things.

457
00:36:40,477 --> 00:36:42,578
And also that I asked you all those unnecessary questions.

458
00:36:42,578 --> 00:36:44,360
All those things…

459
00:36:45,519 --> 00:36:47,332
It has been...

460
00:36:47,332 --> 00:36:49,561
bothering me, too.

461
00:36:57,534 --> 00:36:59,280
Are you free tomorrow?

462
00:37:01,497 --> 00:37:05,299
I'm a bit busy nowadays.

463
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:07,178
Vocal lessons, remember?

464
00:37:07,178 --> 00:37:09,171
Don't you owe your driver something?

465
00:37:09,171 --> 00:37:10,471
What?

466
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:15,814
"I swear... I'll give you vocal lessons! Promise"

467
00:37:15,814 --> 00:37:17,885
Don't talk about that.

468
00:37:18,572 --> 00:37:21,517
All right, I'll give you the lessons.

469
00:37:21,517 --> 00:37:23,560
You promised.

470
00:37:24,386 --> 00:37:25,625
I will…

471
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,665
It's really close by car.

472
00:37:49,086 --> 00:37:51,540
You don't have to accompany me.

473
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:54,347
Do I make you uncomfortable?

474
00:37:56,257 --> 00:37:58,939
I'll just watch you get on.

475
00:38:01,817 --> 00:38:03,217
I…

476
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,896
It's here…

477
00:38:07,604 --> 00:38:09,291
How quick...

478
00:38:09,291 --> 00:38:10,897
Do you want to get the next one?

479
00:38:10,897 --> 00:38:13,748
No, I'll just get going now.

480
00:38:23,145 --> 00:38:24,930
<i>Seung Jun!</i>

481
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:26,756
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

482
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,922
I'll make sure to practice.

483
00:38:32,671 --> 00:38:34,710
<i>Bye!</i>

484
00:38:44,408 --> 00:38:47,006
<i>Relationships are not for me.</i>

485
00:38:47,827 --> 00:38:51,770
<i>But... maybe we could be friends?</i>

486
00:38:55,752 --> 00:38:58,047
<i>[Chan Wu]</i>

487
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,006
Yes, Chan Wu?

488
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:06,304
Teacher Seung Jun, I was just talking about my practice song with the CEO, but...

489
00:39:07,915 --> 00:39:09,826
Seung Jun!

490
00:39:09,826 --> 00:39:11,904
How have you been?

491
00:39:11,904 --> 00:39:14,517
It took me so long to find you.

492
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:17,940

<i>CEO, I'm really full.</i>

504
00:41:08,677 --> 00:41:10,412
<i>I think I ate at least four servings by myself.</i>

505
00:41:10,412 --> 00:41:13,560
<i>I'll get scolded by my manager if I gain weight.</i>

506
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:16,729
<i>He shouldn't tell people to lose weight when he can't even lose his own.</i>

507
00:41:16,729 --> 00:41:19,725

508
00:41:19,725 --> 00:41:22,006
<i>- Really? 
 - Yes.</i>

509
00:41:23,827 --> 00:41:25,834
<i>Seung Jun.</i>

510
00:41:25,834 --> 00:41:27,180
<i>Yes?</i>

511
00:41:27,826 --> 00:41:30,226
<i>You don't have to speak formally when we're alone.</i>

512
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:33,725
<i>I couldn't possibly...</i>

513
00:41:33,725 --> 00:41:35,713
<i>It's fine, really.</i>

514
00:41:36,813 --> 00:41:40,106
<i>I heard that you've lived at a relative's house from a very young age.</i>

515
00:41:40,106 --> 00:41:41,960
<i>You must have been lonely.</i>

516
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,504
<i>Think of me as an older brother.</i>

517
00:41:44,504 --> 00:41:45,880
<i>Okay...</i>

518
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,480
<i>Ju Won... Hyeong.</i>

519
00:41:49,889 --> 00:41:51,031
<i>Cute.</i>

520
00:41:51,031 --> 00:41:52,593
<i>I am quite cute.</i>

521
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:53,931
<i>Do you want to catch a movie after this?</i>

522
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:55,182
<i>Oh! Yes! I'd love to!</i>

523
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:59,014
<i>Let's watch that new horror movie. I heard it was terrifying.</i>

524
00:42:00,479 --> 00:42:05,272
<i>As someone without a family, the only person I trusted.</i>

525
00:42:22,872 --> 00:42:24,332
<i>Hyeong!</i>

526
00:42:46,861 --> 00:42:49,092
<i>What... was that?</i>

527
00:42:49,092 --> 00:42:50,927
<i>I thought you had gone home.</i>

528
00:42:50,927 --> 00:42:52,489
<i>I asked you what that was.</i>

529
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:54,118
<i>What?</i>

530
00:42:55,768 --> 00:42:59,209
<i>How could you do this to me?</i>

531
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:01,596
<i>It has nothing to do with you.</i>

532
00:43:04,334 --> 00:43:05,894
<i>Let's go.</i>

533
00:43:05,894 --> 00:43:07,757
<i>I'll drive you home.</i>

534
00:43:21,746 --> 00:43:23,913
<i>Well done. You've really improved.</i>

535
00:43:23,913 --> 00:43:25,662
<i>Thank you.</i>

536
00:44:08,175 --> 00:44:10,018
<i>Hey, Lee Seung Jun!</i>

537
00:44:10,018 --> 00:44:11,802
<i>Are you really not going to practice?</i>

538
00:44:11,802 --> 00:44:13,487
<i>Pardon?</i>

539
00:44:13,487 --> 00:44:15,789
<i>Do you really think you can debut like this?</i>

540
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:18,891
<i>Are you going to keep holding the other members back?</i>

541
00:44:19,474 --> 00:44:20,644
<i>I'm very sorry.</i>

542
00:44:20,644 --> 00:44:23,175
<i>Aren't you ashamed to face them?</i>

543
00:44:24,611 --> 00:44:26,476
<i>All of you, out.</i>

544
00:44:29,036 --> 00:44:31,823
<i>Get yourself together, for God's sake.</i>

545
00:44:32,798 --> 00:44:34,759
<i>Hey, you have to do better.</i>

546
00:44:34,759 --> 00:44:36,257
<i>He was just taking care of you</i>

547
00:44:36,257 --> 00:44:38,034
<i>because he felt sorry for you.</i>

548
00:44:38,034 --> 00:44:39,624
<i>Well, too bad.</i>

549
00:44:39,624 --> 00:44:41,819
<i>Looks like he abandoned you.</i>

550
00:44:52,734 --> 00:44:54,234
<i>Hyeong.</i>

551
00:44:55,179 --> 00:44:57,875
<i>Why are you doing this to me?</i>

552
00:44:57,875 --> 00:45:00,612
<i>Did I do something wrong?</i>

553
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,544
<i>Please, I'm sorry.</i>

554
00:45:10,711 --> 00:45:12,237
<i>Seung Jun.</i>

555
00:45:12,237 --> 00:45:14,821
<i>You think you're something, don't you?</i>

556
00:45:14,821 --> 00:45:17,223
<i>But you're nothing without me.</i>

557
00:45:17,223 --> 00:45:19,036
<i>Don't delude yourself.</i>

558
00:45:19,036 --> 00:45:21,835
<i>Hyeong, please don't do this to me.</i>

559
00:45:21,835 --> 00:45:23,025
<i>I'll do better.</i>

560
00:45:23,025 --> 00:45:26,217
<i>Don't you think it's a little too late</i>

561
00:45:26,217 --> 00:45:28,576
<i>for this to be a matter of doing better?</i>

562
00:45:34,175 --> 00:45:35,965
<i>Think about it.</i>

563
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:40,420
<i>Hyeong!</i>

564
00:45:42,752 --> 00:45:45,260
<i>Have you always been this kind of person?</i>

565
00:46:09,411 --> 00:46:11,007
<i>Did you get kicked out?</i>

566
00:46:14,441 --> 00:46:16,834
<i>I left.</i>

567
00:46:26,023 --> 00:46:30,031
<i>Hey, your suitcase is so heavy. Carry it yourself.</i>

568
00:46:37,117 --> 00:46:39,596
<i>Are you good at cooking ramyeon?</i>

569
00:46:39,596 --> 00:46:41,877
<i>My mother's ramyeon is terrible.</i>

570
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,354
You're a bit late today.

571
00:46:52,354 --> 00:46:56,545
You should have told me if you were going to be late. I've been waiting up for you.

572
00:46:57,593 --> 00:46:59,393
Ho Yeon.

573
00:46:59,393 --> 00:47:02,053
Sleep at your own place tonight.

574
00:47:02,053 --> 00:47:04,099
Is something wrong?

575
00:47:04,099 --> 00:47:05,595
Please.

576
00:47:22,451 --> 00:47:24,110
Good morning.

577
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:26,872
I slept at home yesterday.

578
00:47:26,872 --> 00:47:30,125
I just dropped by before work. Look! I've even gotten changed.

579
00:47:30,125 --> 00:47:32,102
Okay, have a nice day at work today.

580
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:33,553
What are you doing today?

581
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,394
Why?

582
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,434
Can I not even ask?

583
00:47:37,434 --> 00:47:40,611
You know, you should eat something nice when you're down.

584
00:47:40,611 --> 00:47:42,805
Let's have dinner together.

585
00:47:42,805 --> 00:47:44,611
All right.

586
00:47:47,951 --> 00:47:50,912
Seung Jun. Good morning.

587
00:47:50,912 --> 00:47:54,364
Hi, Seung Jun! Have you eaten?

588
00:47:55,834 --> 00:47:57,694
Seung Jun.

589
00:47:57,694 --> 00:48:00,775
I'm Song Jae Hyeon, and I'm here for the lessons.

590
00:48:14,100 --> 00:48:15,886
Did you leave something behind?

591
00:48:15,886 --> 00:48:17,486
Hello—

592
00:48:21,593 --> 00:48:23,597
<i>Are you free tomorrow?</i>

593
00:48:30,102 --> 00:48:31,334
I…

594
00:48:31,334 --> 00:48:33,519
Today is my day off.

595
00:48:33,519 --> 00:48:38,720
I see... Seung Jun, don't worry about me and take your time getting ready.

596
00:48:40,026 --> 00:48:41,296
Just a moment.

597
00:48:41,296 --> 00:48:42,811
Okay.

598
00:48:52,641 --> 00:48:56,634
Is it all right if we do this at my house?

599
00:49:02,430 --> 00:49:04,050
Not there, here…

600
00:49:04,050 --> 00:49:08,432
Try to clench up your lower stomach and breathe like you're pulling something.

601
00:49:08,432 --> 00:49:09,835
Pulling…

602
00:49:09,835 --> 00:49:12,669
I don't get what that means…

603
00:49:13,430 --> 00:49:15,061
Oh… It's like…

604
00:49:19,431 --> 00:49:21,167
Is it like this?

605
00:49:21,795 --> 00:49:23,985
Here… Here?

606
00:49:27,948 --> 00:49:29,536
Not bad, right?

607
00:49:29,536 --> 00:49:31,051
This is my first time…

608
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,505
but I think I'm catching on really quickly.

609
00:49:33,505 --> 00:49:34,680
Yes.

610
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,665
Seung Jun, is it too hot in here?

611
00:49:36,665 --> 00:49:38,854
Your face is red.

612
00:49:38,854 --> 00:49:41,688
Oh, yes… A little.

613
00:49:42,941 --> 00:49:44,743
Do you want to open the windows?

614
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:47,913
I'll... I'll do it.

615
00:50:16,975 --> 00:50:20,244
Why is the sofa here?

616
00:50:21,238 --> 00:50:24,894
Do you want to call it a day and get some beer?

617
00:50:29,755 --> 00:50:31,210
Why are you laughing?

618
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:35,138
It's a technique that students often use when they want the class to end.

619
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,791
Oh… Is it?

620
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:44,080
Then... would you like a beer at home?

621
00:50:44,742 --> 00:50:46,839
Oh... Yes, I'd love that.

622
00:50:48,450 --> 00:50:50,682
What are you doing after work?

623
00:50:50,682 --> 00:50:53,329
Me? I have plans for dinner.

624
00:50:53,329 --> 00:50:55,161
I'm sure you do.

625
00:50:55,161 --> 00:50:57,207
Are you hiding a lover at home?

626
00:50:57,207 --> 00:50:59,251
What are you talking about?

627
00:50:59,251 --> 00:51:01,327
Please take care of your poor older brother, too.

628
00:51:01,327 --> 00:51:03,152
It's not like that.

629
00:51:03,152 --> 00:51:06,817
You'd better not get caught, I'll make you regret it.

630
00:51:06,817 --> 00:51:09,261
Let's go some other time. I'll buy you something good.

631
00:51:09,261 --> 00:51:10,768
Fine.

632
00:51:19,428 --> 00:51:23,620
I really wanted to get vocal lessons, but we have a lot ahead of us, don't we?

633
00:51:24,282 --> 00:51:28,558
It will take time, but I think it's possible.

634
00:51:28,558 --> 00:51:30,724
How much time?

635
00:51:30,724 --> 00:51:35,210
I don't know. I guess it depends on how much you practice.

636
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:44,924
I want to learn from you for a really long time, Seung Jun.

637
00:51:48,842 --> 00:51:51,391
I'm just kidding.

638
00:51:52,152 --> 00:51:54,364
Should we speak comfortably?

639
00:51:54,364 --> 00:51:55,866
What?

640
00:51:55,866 --> 00:51:59,058
I think it will help us get more comfortable with each other.

641
00:51:59,870 --> 00:52:01,243
Right...

642
00:52:02,324 --> 00:52:03,724
"-yo." 
 <i>(T/N: an ending added to make a phrase more formal/polite in Korean)</i>

643
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:07,695
Take your time.

644
00:52:08,659 --> 00:52:10,430
Okay.

645
00:52:11,972 --> 00:52:15,570
Why do you want to learn to sing anyway?

646
00:52:17,229 --> 00:52:23,022
I've always wanted to sing a song for my lover at the altar.

647
00:52:23,022 --> 00:52:25,812
Not that I know who it will be.

648
00:52:25,812 --> 00:52:28,933
- I can write the song for you when the time comes. 
 - Can you write songs too?

649
00:52:28,933 --> 00:52:31,767
I was a trainee since I was in high school.

650
00:52:31,767 --> 00:52:35,725
I learned everything from singing to dancing, and composing.

651
00:52:37,385 --> 00:52:40,735
I can't imagine you dancing.

652
00:52:40,735 --> 00:52:44,978
You would have made a great idol. Why did you quit?

653
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:50,623
How could I sing with sunglasses on?

654
00:52:54,596 --> 00:52:56,213
Get up.

655
00:52:58,064 --> 00:52:59,708
Quickly.

656
00:53:06,187 --> 00:53:09,356
Imagine that this is the wedding hall.

657
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:12,822
I'm sitting at the piano as your accompanist.

658
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:14,160
Huh?

659
00:53:14,987 --> 00:53:16,734
Focus.

660
00:53:17,678 --> 00:53:21,760
A beautiful melody fills the hall.

661
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:25,652
And you meet my eyes before you start singing.

662
00:53:27,425 --> 00:53:29,025
And…

663
00:53:29,957 --> 00:53:34,682
Imagine that there's only you and me there.

664
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,180
What is that supposed to mean?

665
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:45,799
You never know. You might sing better when I'm the only one you can see.

666
00:53:46,585 --> 00:53:48,495
Now try it.

667
00:53:48,495 --> 00:53:49,855
No.

668
00:53:49,855 --> 00:53:51,423
Try it.

669
00:53:51,423 --> 00:53:53,442
I just cast a spell on you.

670
00:53:53,442 --> 00:53:55,090
I said no.

671
00:53:55,090 --> 00:53:58,004
Come on, just once.

672
00:53:58,652 --> 00:53:59,862
Just this once!

673
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:02,056
- I said no! 
 - Just this once!

674
00:54:02,056 --> 00:54:03,949
Just once. Hm?

675
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:05,359
Hey, Ho Yeon!

676
00:54:12,277 --> 00:54:13,320
Who's this?

677
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:17,166
This is Song Jae Hyeon, who will be taking classes from me starting today.

678
00:54:17,166 --> 00:54:19,627
I mean... he's Jae Hyeon Hyeong.

679
00:54:22,050 --> 00:54:25,335
Hi, I'm Song Jae Hyeon.

680
00:54:25,335 --> 00:54:28,685
- Okay. 
 - And this is my friend, Im Ho Yeon. He lives upstairs.

681
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:30,297
I see.

682
00:54:32,641 --> 00:54:35,081
I didn't realize it was so late.

683
00:54:35,081 --> 00:54:37,511
Seung Jun, I should get going.

684
00:54:37,511 --> 00:54:39,571
See you again, Ho Yeon.

685
00:54:39,571 --> 00:54:42,649
Yeah, hurry home safely.

686
00:54:42,649 --> 00:54:44,130
Yes.

687
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:57,690
You finished early.

688
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:01,053
I'm relieved to see that you look happier than you did a while ago.

689
00:55:01,053 --> 00:55:03,206
- Good night. 
 - Are you going home?

690
00:55:03,206 --> 00:55:04,872
Let's eat together!

691
00:55:04,872 --> 00:55:06,929
I already ate.

692
00:55:47,289 --> 00:55:49,711
<i>[You must be busy. When can we meet?]</i>

693
00:55:50,420 --> 00:55:54,417
<i>Why is he looking for me?</i>

694
00:55:57,191 --> 00:55:58,794
Seung Jun!

695
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:01,553
I've been calling you for a while.

696
00:56:01,553 --> 00:56:04,016
Sorry, I didn't hear you.

697
00:56:04,016 --> 00:56:05,446
Let's go in.

698
00:56:06,752 --> 00:56:09,942
- How are you feeling today? 
 - I'm good.

699
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:18,901
Next up is a song to celebrate the bright future of the bride and groom!

700
00:56:18,901 --> 00:56:22,242
Please give them a round of applause.

I almost made a mistake... Please don't do that again.

710
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,912
It's nice to see you smile.

711
00:57:58,420 --> 00:58:00,002
I shouldn't have said that.

712
00:58:00,002 --> 00:58:01,919
There's that startled expression again.

713
00:58:01,919 --> 00:58:04,610
It's just that it's really nice to see you smile!

714
00:58:06,077 --> 00:58:08,075
You don't have classes today, right?

715
00:58:08,075 --> 00:58:10,031
I'll drive you home.

716
00:58:26,256 --> 00:58:27,900
Seung Jun.

717
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:34,270
- Seung Jun! 
 - What?

718
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:35,787
Why are you staring at your phone?

719
00:58:35,787 --> 00:58:38,034
Are you waiting for a call?

720
00:58:38,034 --> 00:58:39,436
No.

721
00:58:40,812 --> 00:58:43,355
But there is someone I hope never calls.

722
00:58:48,821 --> 00:58:51,520
I have to stop by some place.

723
00:59:07,758 --> 00:59:09,529
Where is he?

724
00:59:21,086 --> 00:59:23,793
What the...

725
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:25,828
Are you up?

726
00:59:26,942 --> 00:59:28,942
Why did you come here?

727
00:59:28,942 --> 00:59:30,864
Something is troubling you, isn't it?

728
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:35,706
But you wouldn't tell me even if I asked.

729
00:59:35,706 --> 00:59:38,348
So I'm just going to stay with you.

730
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:45,071
I'll keep this with me for a while.

731
00:59:51,874 --> 00:59:53,655
Should we take a walk?

732
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,156
How is it?

733
01:00:20,691 --> 01:00:22,806
This is nice.

734
01:00:22,806 --> 01:00:25,806
No more complicated thoughts.

735
01:00:25,806 --> 01:00:28,639
I like it, too.

736
01:00:28,639 --> 01:00:30,544
Do you come here often?

737
01:00:30,544 --> 01:00:31,756
Yes.

738
01:00:31,756 --> 01:00:34,059
When I'm frustrated...

739
01:00:34,657 --> 01:00:36,756
When I want to listen...

740
01:00:36,756 --> 01:00:39,222
When I wonder what you're doing.

741
01:00:42,684 --> 01:00:44,545
When I miss you.

742
01:00:45,250 --> 01:00:48,109
That is why I come to see you.

743
01:00:50,134 --> 01:00:52,761
Why are you being like this...

744
01:00:52,761 --> 01:00:55,256
to someone like me.

745
01:00:57,199 --> 01:00:59,795
I've never done anything like this before, either.

746
01:01:01,084 --> 01:01:03,380
But I just want to stay by your side...

747
01:01:03,975 --> 01:01:05,996
and protect you.

748
01:01:10,757 --> 01:01:12,915
I can't resist anymore.

749
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:16,423

Thank you very much!

787
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:33,612
Yes, good job today.

Chan Wu.

789
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:43,746
Why don't you try taking another teacher's class?

790
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:45,646
What?

791
01:04:45,646 --> 01:04:47,079
Why?

792
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:49,619
I don't want to. I like you.

793
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:52,835
The CEO told me he likes you, too.

794
01:04:52,835 --> 01:04:55,942
Dance songs aren't really my area of expertise.

795
01:04:55,942 --> 01:04:59,057
And I was planning on getting some time off from the academy.

796
01:04:59,057 --> 01:05:02,064
Oh, I see.

797
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:03,862
That's a shame.

798
01:05:03,862 --> 01:05:05,746
I'll see you out.

799
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,019
Get back safely.

800
01:05:15,019 --> 01:05:18,164
Teacher, does that mean we won't be seeing each other?

801
01:05:18,164 --> 01:05:20,320
It's not like we will never see each other again if we don't meet here anymore.

802
01:05:20,320 --> 01:05:22,168
You can call me if something happens.

803
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:24,427
Oh! Thank you, Teacher.

804
01:05:24,427 --> 01:05:26,869
Can I call you often?

805
01:05:26,869 --> 01:05:28,536
Not too often.

806
01:05:28,536 --> 01:05:30,534
Okay.

807
01:05:32,408 --> 01:05:35,147
Oh! It's the CEO! Sir!

808
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:49,407
Chan Wu, can you wait for me in the car for a little while?

809
01:05:50,192 --> 01:05:51,439
Yes.

810
01:05:59,471 --> 01:06:01,086
How have you been?

811
01:06:01,086 --> 01:06:04,089
What are you doing?

812
01:06:04,089 --> 01:06:08,689
What does it look like? I'm just picking up my trainee.

813
01:06:09,203 --> 01:06:11,076
Did you send him here on purpose?

814
01:06:11,076 --> 01:06:12,873
Isn't Chan Wu nice?

815
01:06:12,873 --> 01:06:15,246
I thought you two would get along.

816
01:06:16,277 --> 01:06:20,017
He is a lot like you.

817
01:06:24,574 --> 01:06:28,074
You must be having a hard time. Your face looks rough.

818
01:06:33,615 --> 01:06:37,053
My little Seung Jun, you used to be so nice when you were younger.

819
01:06:37,053 --> 01:06:39,470
If you don't have anything to say, I will leave now.

820
01:06:39,470 --> 01:06:41,276
What's the rush?

821
01:06:41,276 --> 01:06:44,426
I have a proposal for you.

822
01:06:47,299 --> 01:06:49,770
Do you want to come work for my company?

823
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:51,370
What?

824
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:55,021
Your composing skills must have improved by now, right?

825
01:07:00,003 --> 01:07:02,904
You know we don't accept just anybody at our company.

826
01:07:02,904 --> 01:07:05,608
I can hire you because I'm the CEO.

827
01:07:08,570 --> 01:07:10,371
I want nothing to do with you.

828
01:07:10,371 --> 01:07:12,672
Think carefully.

829
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:19,427
No matter how much you agonize over it...

830
01:07:19,427 --> 01:07:22,733
you'll eventually come running to me.

831
01:07:29,522 --> 01:07:31,817
I'll be leaving now, since Chan Wu is waiting.

832
01:07:54,533 --> 01:07:58,367
Why... Why is he doing this to me?

833
01:07:58,367 --> 01:08:01,067
What have I done so wrong?

834
01:08:01,067 --> 01:08:02,687
Hey, Seung Jun!

835
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:04,960
You haven't done anything wrong.

836
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,029
He's just crazy. What other reason would he need?

837
01:08:10,318 --> 01:08:12,244
I just...

838
01:08:12,244 --> 01:08:15,922
I'll just stop everything and live a quiet life,

839
01:08:18,473 --> 01:08:21,771
so it would be nice if he could just leave me alone.

840
01:08:49,094 --> 01:08:50,795
Aren't you going home?

841
01:08:50,795 --> 01:08:53,947
Oh, I have to finish something. You go ahead.

842
01:08:53,947 --> 01:08:55,031

01:13:20,568 --> 01:13:23,357
Please, go...

885
01:13:24,371 --> 01:13:28,242
Boss, do you... want me to set up a blind date?

886
01:13:28,242 --> 01:13:33,284
I know someone really nice. I think this person would be perfect for you.

887
01:13:33,284 --> 01:13:34,562
I don't know...

888
01:13:34,562 --> 01:13:36,329
She's really pretty, really!

889
01:13:36,329 --> 01:13:39,459
Hyeong! Do you want to go out for dinner then?

890
01:13:39,459 --> 01:13:41,191
It's on me!

891
01:13:46,822 --> 01:13:48,282
The two of you should go.

892
01:13:48,282 --> 01:13:50,468
Come on, let's go. You know how stingy he usually is─

893
01:13:50,468 --> 01:13:53,168
It's now or never.

894
01:14:15,284 --> 01:14:17,635
It's not easy to work alone.

895
01:14:17,635 --> 01:14:19,084
You made the right choice.

896
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:21,369
I didn't come here because of that.

897
01:14:21,369 --> 01:14:23,191
I came because of Chan Wu.

898
01:14:24,156 --> 01:14:26,160
Oh, Chan Wu?

899
01:14:26,160 --> 01:14:27,755
What about him?

900
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:29,902
Chan Wu has potential.

901
01:14:29,902 --> 01:14:31,688
I'm here to ask you a favor.

902
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:37,936
And what makes you think I will grant it?

903
01:14:37,936 --> 01:14:40,114
You sent Chan Wu to me.

904
01:14:40,114 --> 01:14:42,382
Aren't you still interested in me?

905
01:14:42,382 --> 01:14:44,279
Yes...

906
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:46,525
There was no one quite like you.

907
01:14:47,374 --> 01:14:50,282
Weren't you the happiest when we were together, too?

908
01:14:50,282 --> 01:14:53,575
I don't think anyone would have been as nice to you as I was.

909
01:14:55,652 --> 01:14:57,152
No.

910
01:14:58,294 --> 01:15:00,988
I wasn't happy then.

911
01:15:00,988 --> 01:15:04,365
It all crumbled down at that moment.

912
01:15:04,365 --> 01:15:06,817
So much that I wanted to cut you out of my life.

913
01:15:07,591 --> 01:15:10,093
You never liked me.

914
01:15:10,093 --> 01:15:13,265
You just needed someone to toy with.

915
01:15:15,432 --> 01:15:17,741
What are you trying to say?

916
01:15:17,741 --> 01:15:19,586
Chan Wu.

917
01:15:19,586 --> 01:15:22,387
He may rely on you now,

918
01:15:23,056 --> 01:15:25,448
but he will realize it soon enough.

919
01:15:26,278 --> 01:15:28,062
Before that happens...

920
01:15:28,939 --> 01:15:31,931
I'm giving you a chance to be the person he thinks you are.

921
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:40,700
Having no one beside you...

922
01:15:40,700 --> 01:15:42,905
That's a lonely thing, isn't it?

923
01:15:48,281 --> 01:15:50,570
You're all grown up,

924
01:15:50,570 --> 01:15:52,988
talking to your hyeong like this.

925
01:15:52,988 --> 01:15:54,941
Please.

926
01:15:58,466 --> 01:16:00,676
Wait, Seung Jun.

927
01:16:02,688 --> 01:16:04,898
Okay, I understand.

928
01:16:04,898 --> 01:16:08,699
I will do what you say if we get back together.

929
01:16:10,583 --> 01:16:13,788
Seung Jun, I can do better.

930
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,936
Don't lie to me.

931
01:16:16,936 --> 01:16:18,734
I won't fall for it again.

932
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:23,369
Hey! Lee Seung Jun! Hey!

933
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:28,572
I'll see myself out.

934
01:16:28,572 --> 01:16:31,902
- See you tomorrow. 
 - See you tomorrow.

935
01:16:51,069 --> 01:16:53,380
You don't have to take me home.

936
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:54,932
Do I make you uncomfortable?

937
01:16:54,932 --> 01:16:58,781
No... Not uncomfortable.

938
01:16:58,781 --> 01:17:00,162
<i>Do I make you uncomfortable?</i>

939
01:17:00,162 --> 01:17:02,389
<i>I'll just watch you get on.</i>

940
01:17:02,389 --> 01:17:04,122
<i>It's here...</i>

941
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:07,764
<i>How quick...</i>

942
01:17:08,587 --> 01:17:10,381
<i>Do you want to get the next one?</i>

943
01:17:10,381 --> 01:17:13,482
<i>No, I'll just get going now.</i>

944
01:17:24,811 --> 01:17:26,624
Wait!

945
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:42,646
<i>Having no one beside you...</i>

946
01:17:42,646 --> 01:17:44,946
<i>That's a lonely thing, isn't it?</i>

947
01:17:48,703 --> 01:17:54,220
<i>The words may have been aimed at him, but they also hit me.</i>

948
01:18:15,913 --> 01:18:18,405
What on earth happened?

949
01:18:32,474 --> 01:18:35,247
- Seung Jun! 
 - Hey, Seung Jun!

950
01:18:38,555 --> 01:18:39,678
Let's go!

951
01:18:39,678 --> 01:18:41,221
Let go!

952
01:18:41,221 --> 01:18:43,182
I said let go.

953
01:18:43,182 --> 01:18:46,188
It's my turn now, and I'm not letting you go.

954
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:47,669
Seung Jun!

955
01:18:47,669 --> 01:18:48,770
Stop this.

956
01:18:48,770 --> 01:18:50,005
If you don't come with me,

957
01:18:50,005 --> 01:18:52,185
he's not going to come out of this in one piece.

958
01:18:55,419 --> 01:18:57,089
He said no.

959
01:18:57,089 --> 01:18:58,783
Who do you think you're putting your hands on?

960
01:19:00,544 --> 01:19:02,373
- Son of a... 
 - Stop it.

961
01:19:06,288 --> 01:19:08,811
I don't know what it was like before,

962
01:19:08,811 --> 01:19:10,915
but now I'm not letting him go.

963
01:19:10,915 --> 01:19:14,428
Don't ever come near Seung Jun again, or...

964
01:19:16,076 --> 01:19:18,574
I'll make you regret it.

965
01:19:24,741 --> 01:19:26,350
Hey! Lee Seung Jun!

966
01:19:26,350 --> 01:19:29,085
Do you think he's any different? Hey!

967
01:19:40,764 --> 01:19:42,474
You should go now.

968
01:19:43,569 --> 01:19:45,765
I'll leave after I see you go inside.

969
01:19:48,274 --> 01:19:52,026
- Do you know why Kim Ju Won is doing this to me? 
 - What?

970
01:19:52,026 --> 01:19:54,837
Do you know why he stayed away all this while

971
01:19:54,837 --> 01:19:57,448
and decided to appear out of the blue?

972
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:02,874
It's because you kept getting closer to me.

973
01:20:02,874 --> 01:20:05,055
I don't want to see either of you,

974
01:20:05,055 --> 01:20:07,248
so just go away.

975
01:20:08,252 --> 01:20:10,836
You shouldn't be alone right now.

976
01:20:10,836 --> 01:20:12,820
Why would you even want to be with me?

977
01:20:12,820 --> 01:20:14,274
Out of pity?

978
01:20:14,274 --> 01:20:17,617
Do you feel all grand and mighty when you're with someone like me?

979
01:20:17,617 --> 01:20:20,467
- It's not like that. 
 - Then what is the reason?

980
01:20:22,197 --> 01:20:24,703
I want to be there for you.

981
01:20:30,056 --> 01:20:34,455
That asshole and you are more or less the same.

982
01:20:35,103 --> 01:20:38,213
- You both make my life difficult. 
 - Seung Jun!

983
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:39,907
Please.

984
01:20:39,907 --> 01:20:41,709
Leave.

985
01:20:42,910 --> 01:20:45,607
Leave me alone for God's sake.

986
01:20:47,491 --> 01:20:48,991
All right.

987
01:20:50,667 --> 01:20:52,273
I'll go.

988
01:21:06,160 --> 01:21:10,064
<i>Showing him this side of me...</i>

989
01:21:10,064 --> 01:21:13,056
<i>was worse than seeing that jerk again.</i>

990
01:21:23,373 --> 01:21:27,468
<i>I tried so hard to become a different person after that.</i>

991
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:37,445
Hello. I'm Lee Seung Jun, the composer.

992
01:21:37,445 --> 01:21:40,674
I sent you an email, and I was wondering if you got it.

993
01:21:40,674 --> 01:21:41,969
Please make sure to forward it.

994
01:21:41,969 --> 01:21:43,269
Yes.

995
01:22:05,868 --> 01:22:07,069
Hello?

996
01:22:07,069 --> 01:22:09,586
<i>Are you Lee Seung Jun?</i>

997
01:22:09,586 --> 01:22:10,898
Oh, yes, that's right.

998
01:22:10,898 --> 01:22:15,402
<i>Hello, this is Grim Music. Thank you for sending us your song.</i>

999
01:22:15,402 --> 01:22:17,292
<i>Can you come for a meeting tomorrow?</i>

1000
01:22:17,292 --> 01:22:19,159
Yes, yes, I can do it.

1001
01:22:19,882 --> 01:22:21,569
Thank you.

1002
01:22:26,304 --> 01:22:29,903
<i>And I began to change.</i>

 <i>[One year later]</i>

1004

♪ I hope we can meet again outside of what exists in my memories ♪

1005
01:22:51,914 --> 01:22:55,270
Yeon Oh! I think it's done.

1006
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:57,936
- Already? 
 - Yes, we've got it.

1007
01:22:57,936 --> 01:22:59,625
You can come out.

1008
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:01,732
Thank you.

1009
01:23:01,732 --> 01:23:03,175
- Isn't it good? 
 - It really is.

1010
01:23:03,175 --> 01:23:04,577
Right?

1011
01:23:08,942 --> 01:23:10,057
Was it okay?

1012
01:23:10,057 --> 01:23:13,560
- This song is going to be a total hit. 
 - Thank you.

1013
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:16,280
No, no, it's all on you.

1014
01:23:17,643 --> 01:23:20,199
Hi, hello, hi.

1015
01:23:20,199 --> 01:23:22,372
- Chan Wu! 
 - Hyeong!

1016
01:23:22,372 --> 01:23:24,029
Congratulations.

1017
01:23:24,029 --> 01:23:26,220
Are you done recording already?

1018
01:23:26,220 --> 01:23:28,128
I knew you'd make it!

1019
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:30,035
It just ended. Thank you.

1020
01:23:30,035 --> 01:23:31,372
Are you all right?

1021
01:23:31,372 --> 01:23:33,371
I'm... good, I guess.

1022
01:23:33,371 --> 01:23:36,274
I love working at the same company as you.

1023
01:23:36,274 --> 01:23:38,785
I can breathe easier, you know.

1024
01:23:38,785 --> 01:23:41,516
I knew that asshole Kim Ju Won was going to go down.

1025
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:43,398
I mean, he shouldn't have messed with kids.

1026
01:23:43,398 --> 01:23:47,077
I know, right? This is why you shouldn't judge a person by physical appearance alone.

1027
01:23:47,077 --> 01:23:48,966
Well, it all worked out.

1028
01:23:48,966 --> 01:23:52,808
Ugh... Just thinking about him makes me lose my appetite.

1029
01:23:52,808 --> 01:23:56,509
Yeon Oh? Do you want to get some beef?

1030
01:23:56,509 --> 01:23:59,567
Sorry, I've got plans.

1031
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:00,826
Okay.

1032
01:24:04,945 --> 01:24:06,097
Im Ho Yeon,

1033
01:24:06,097 --> 01:24:07,656
I'll take care of the rest.

1034
01:24:07,656 --> 01:24:10,148
No, it's all right.

1035
01:24:10,148 --> 01:24:12,372
Your lover is here... Go see him.

1036
01:24:12,372 --> 01:24:15,070
Come on! I told you we are not dating!

1037
01:24:15,070 --> 01:24:17,929
- Get this cleaned up. 
 - Okay.

1038
01:24:21,778 --> 01:24:24,483
How is work? Is it fun?

1039
01:24:25,269 --> 01:24:27,764
I'm still getting used to it, I guess.

1040
01:24:29,090 --> 01:24:31,878
You should thank me for everything.

1041
01:24:32,928 --> 01:24:35,033
Yes.

1042
01:24:35,033 --> 01:24:37,308
I'm most grateful to you.

1043
01:24:46,268 --> 01:24:47,928
Seung Jun!

1044
01:24:56,949 --> 01:24:58,810
Buy me dinner sometime...

1045
01:25:01,710 --> 01:25:03,376
Okay.

1046
01:25:08,967 --> 01:25:11,612
I wonder what he's doing now.

1047
01:25:12,846 --> 01:25:15,636
Who? Song Jae Hyeon?

1048
01:25:16,533 --> 01:25:18,821
He's probably having dinner.

1049
01:25:20,771 --> 01:25:23,571
If you miss him so much, you should go see him.

1050
01:25:25,382 --> 01:25:28,092
Will he want to see me, too?

1051
01:25:31,921 --> 01:25:35,476
Sometimes I can't tell if you're really clueless... or just pretending.

1052
01:25:37,266 --> 01:25:39,168
Wait, no.

1053
01:25:39,168 --> 01:25:41,520
You are definitely clueless.

1054
01:25:44,686 --> 01:25:46,980
Go get him.

1055
01:25:46,980 --> 01:25:49,312
Before it's really too late.

1056
01:26:21,081 --> 01:26:23,661
Hello.

1057
01:26:23,661 --> 01:26:24,871
Would you like to order?

1058
01:26:24,871 --> 01:26:26,929
One hot Americano, please.

1059
01:26:26,929 --> 01:26:28,703
Okay.

1060
01:26:52,921 --> 01:26:54,042
Excuse me, Sir.

1061
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:56,617
We are about to close.

1062
01:26:56,617 --> 01:26:59,328
Would you like it in a to-go cup?

1063
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:02,127
No, it's okay.

1064
01:27:14,484 --> 01:27:16,778
<i>Without him,</i>

1065
01:27:16,778 --> 01:27:20,069
<i>all this would have been impossible.</i>

1066
01:27:21,266 --> 01:27:26,101
<i>I started singing again so I could be confident in front of him.</i>

1067
01:27:36,646 --> 01:27:38,677
Are you nervous?

1068
01:27:38,677 --> 01:27:40,130
You'll come with me, right?

1069
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:43,964
I dropped everything for you. Hurry up and get ready, we're going to be late.

1070
01:27:51,641 --> 01:27:54,983
<i>Now, it was terribly difficult to get this person to join us.</i>

1071
01:27:54,983 --> 01:27:58,776
<i>But you guys know us, and we finally made it possible.</i>

1072
01:27:58,776 --> 01:28:01,332
<i>It's his first time meeting the audience.</i>

1073
01:28:01,332 --> 01:28:03,251
<i>Are you excited, Guys?</i>

1074
01:28:03,251 --> 01:28:04,451
<i>Yes!</i>

1075
01:28:04,451 --> 01:28:06,970
That's nowhere near enough! Let me hear it! Are you excited?

1076
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:08,325
<i>Yes!</i>

1077
01:28:08,325 --> 01:28:11,233
Great, there are so many fans waiting here.

1078
01:28:11,233 --> 01:28:15,087
We now have around 26,000 viewers watching.

1079
01:28:15,087 --> 01:28:21,102
And we have 20 lucky fans here who have been picked to join us.

1080
01:28:21,102 --> 01:28:28,787
I think we ought to stop stalling, before we get cursed out.

1081
01:28:28,787 --> 01:28:31,998
So let's get down to it.

1082
01:28:31,998 --> 01:28:34,793
Here's the masked singer, the man from the video with 10 million views!

1083
01:28:34,793 --> 01:28:38,680
I give you Yeon Oh. A big round of applause, please.

1084
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:41,083
Oh! Hello!

1085
01:28:41,083 --> 01:28:43,783
Louder!

1086
01:28:44,667 --> 01:28:46,768
Yeon Oh, hi!

1087
01:28:46,768 --> 01:28:50,775
It's your first time meeting the audience, so please say hello.

1088
01:28:50,775 --> 01:28:53,848
Hello, I'm Yeon Oh, a singer and songwriter.

1089
01:28:55,201 --> 01:28:56,206
Yeon Oh!

1090
01:28:56,206 --> 01:28:57,529
<i>Forever!</i>

1091
01:28:57,529 --> 01:28:58,447
Yeon Oh!

1092
01:28:58,447 --> 01:28:59,857
<i>Forever!</i>

1093
01:28:59,857 --> 01:29:02,567
Your fans shouted, "Yeon Oh forever."

1094
01:29:02,567 --> 01:29:04,674
Here! Please take a seat.

1095
01:29:04,674 --> 01:29:08,785
Now, we can see your song was released at 10 a.m. today,

1096
01:29:08,785 --> 01:29:10,918
and it has shot up the charts quickly.

1097
01:29:10,918 --> 01:29:13,264
Yes, I can barely believe it myself.

1098
01:29:13,264 --> 01:29:18,426
I heard that this song was based on your own experiences.

1099
01:29:18,426 --> 01:29:19,572
Yes, that's true.

1100
01:29:19,572 --> 01:29:23,113
Now, a lot of people, myself included, must be wondering about that.

1101
01:29:23,113 --> 01:29:27,511
Could you tell us your story in more detail here?

1102
01:29:30,646 --> 01:29:33,457
When I had a severe panic disorder,

1103
01:29:33,457 --> 01:29:36,254
I met that person for the first time.

1104
01:29:47,287 --> 01:29:48,787
<i>Wait...</i>

1105
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:54,269
<i>Do you want to have dinner together?</i>

1106
01:29:54,269 --> 01:29:55,988
<i>I'll... I'll do it.</i>

1107
01:30:02,694 --> 01:30:07,067
<i>Why are you being like this... to someone like me?</i>

1108
01:30:07,067 --> 01:30:11,940
<i>I just want to stay by your side and protect you.</i>

1109
01:30:14,795 --> 01:30:16,695
<i>Please.</i>

1110
01:30:16,695 --> 01:30:18,410
<i>Leave.</i>

1111
01:30:19,502 --> 01:30:22,300
<i>Leave me alone for God's sake.</i>

1112
01:30:24,091 --> 01:30:25,655
<i>All right.</i>

1113
01:30:28,073 --> 01:30:33,870
That person must be really regretting not holding on to you right now, right?

1114
01:30:33,870 --> 01:30:37,901
Now that we have you here, we have to listen to your new song.

1115
01:30:37,901 --> 01:30:40,060
- Yeon Oh, are you ready? 
 - Yes, I am.

1116
01:30:40,060 --> 01:30:44,105
Here's Yeon Oh's new title track, "Reaching Out to You."

1117
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:48,181

This is really it.

1129
01:32:15,962 --> 01:32:17,162
Hyeong.

1130
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:20,218
Aren't you sad?

1131
01:32:20,218 --> 01:32:22,317
I am, but...

1132
01:32:22,317 --> 01:32:26,547
You've got a job, and Hyeon Ji needs to go back to school.

1133
01:32:26,547 --> 01:32:28,235
There's no point in doing this by myself.

1134
01:32:29,319 --> 01:32:31,465
What are you going to do now?

1135
01:32:31,465 --> 01:32:33,758
I don't know...

1136
01:32:33,758 --> 01:32:36,127
I suppose I'll try everything that comes to mind.

1137
01:32:36,710 --> 01:32:38,709
Learn to sing.

1138
01:32:38,709 --> 01:32:40,491
Travel more.

1139
01:32:41,788 --> 01:32:45,048
Oppa, worry about yourself.

1140
01:32:45,048 --> 01:32:47,718
He can get along just fine without having to work.

1141
01:32:47,718 --> 01:32:50,598
- Do you spend the whole day worrying over me? 
 - What?

1142
01:32:50,598 --> 01:32:52,973
Don't... You might fall for me.

1143
01:32:52,973 --> 01:32:54,694
You are ridiculous.

1144
01:32:54,694 --> 01:32:57,321
They say a strong no actually means yes. Are you interested in me?

1145
01:32:57,321 --> 01:32:58,711
Wow... No!

1146
01:32:58,711 --> 01:33:01,434
Don't you dare start. I'm going to kick you so hard.

1147
01:33:01,434 --> 01:33:04,097
Just eat some of this. It's good, right?

1148
01:33:13,410 --> 01:33:17,207
<i>Yes, thank you for the wonderful song.</i>

1149
01:33:17,207 --> 01:33:18,916
The performance was perfect.

1150
01:33:18,916 --> 01:33:20,709
It was really good.

1151
01:33:20,709 --> 01:33:23,720
Thank you. I'll be off now.

1152
01:33:33,317 --> 01:33:35,365
<i>Since the last day I saw him,</i>

1153
01:33:35,365 --> 01:33:38,672
<i>not a day has gone by that I haven't thought about him.</i>

1154
01:33:42,022 --> 01:33:45,060
<i>If I had stood by his side through it all,</i>

1155
01:33:46,402 --> 01:33:52,254
<i>would he and I be looking at the sea together now?</i>

1156
01:33:54,009 --> 01:33:56,912
I didn't think Seung Jun would be so successful...

1157
01:33:57,513 --> 01:34:00,467
If I had known, I would have treated him better.

1158
01:34:00,467 --> 01:34:03,383
It's going to be so hard to see him now.

1159
01:34:03,383 --> 01:34:05,457
It has always been hard.

1160
01:34:05,457 --> 01:34:06,880
Right?

1161
01:34:06,880 --> 01:34:09,001
Oh! Good job, Jae Hyeon!

1162
01:34:09,691 --> 01:34:12,304
Jae Hyeon, look at this. Okay?

1163
01:34:14,638 --> 01:34:17,134
<i>Are you doing well?</i>

1164
01:34:18,216 --> 01:34:21,021
<i>I wanted to sing this to you in person.</i>

1165
01:34:21,021 --> 01:34:23,042
<i>But I guess this is how I can sing it to you now.</i>

1166
01:34:24,456 --> 01:34:29,520
<i>Thanks to you, I've been able to sing like this, and I've grown a lot too. </i>

1167
01:34:31,447 --> 01:34:33,371
Hey! Song Jae Hyeon!

1168
01:34:38,011 --> 01:34:39,580
Can I go in just for a moment?

1169
01:34:39,580 --> 01:34:41,146
I'm afraid you can't.

1170
01:34:41,146 --> 01:34:43,667
It will only take a second. I know Seung Jun personally.

1171
01:34:43,667 --> 01:34:47,379
We have no way of confirming that, and it has already started, so I can't let you in.

1172
01:34:47,379 --> 01:34:50,185
Please, it will only be a moment.

1173
01:34:50,983 --> 01:34:52,580
He's an acquaintance.

1174
01:34:55,673 --> 01:34:56,914
Ho Yeon.

1175
01:34:56,914 --> 01:34:58,686
Long time no see.

1176
01:34:58,686 --> 01:35:02,098

I can breathe now.

1232
01:39:57,520 --> 01:40:04,780
♫ <i>It feels as though you are right in front of me </i>♫

1233
01:40:04,780 --> 01:40:10,780
♫ <i>But even if I reach out my hand...</i> ♫

1234
01:40:10,780 --> 01:40:13,785
I thought you didn't want to see me.

1235
01:40:15,224 --> 01:40:16,654
It's not that.

1236
01:40:17,205 --> 01:40:20,954
I was afraid you would be disappointed in me and leave.

1237
01:40:20,954 --> 01:40:23,462
I didn't want to get hurt.

1238
01:40:24,206 --> 01:40:27,284
I was also worried Kim Ju Won would hurt you.

1239
01:40:37,788 --> 01:40:40,284
Let's never part ways again.

1240
01:40:46,393 --> 01:40:48,536
Can I hold your hand?

1241
01:40:49,758 --> 01:40:51,410
You've never been in a proper relationship, have you?

1242
01:40:51,410 --> 01:40:53,359
You can do much more than that.

1243
01:41:16,115 --> 01:41:18,100
Get up.

1244
01:41:18,100 --> 01:41:20,785
If we are late, we'll get pushed back.

1245
01:41:21,874 --> 01:41:23,442
What time is it?

1246
01:41:23,442 --> 01:41:25,249
Ten o'clock.

1247
01:41:25,249 --> 01:41:27,575
I'll wash up first.

1248
01:41:29,782 --> 01:41:31,114
Shall we shower together?

1249
01:41:31,114 --> 01:41:32,720
No.

1250
01:41:33,435 --> 01:41:35,207
Come on, really?

1251
01:41:35,207 --> 01:41:37,305
Let's shower together...

1252
01:41:37,305 --> 01:41:38,619
No.

1253
01:41:38,619 --> 01:41:39,850
Why not?

1254
01:41:39,850 --> 01:41:41,262
I'm going to take a shower.

1255
01:41:41,262 --> 01:41:43,625
Oh, come on, I'll just brush my teeth then.

1256
01:41:43,625 --> 01:41:45,343
Just my teeth... Come on!

1257
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:47,204
Come in then.

1258
01:41:47,204 --> 01:41:48,904
