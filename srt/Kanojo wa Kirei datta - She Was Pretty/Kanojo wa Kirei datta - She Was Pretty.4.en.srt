1
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:09,580
Deputy editor?

2
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:12,980
It's all right.

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:15,630
Don't worry. Nothing will happen to you.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,350
It's all right. Don't worry.

5
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:19,250
It's all right.

6
00:00:19,330 --> 00:00:20,600
It'll be fine.

7
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,380
I'll be there for you from now on.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,300
I'll be your umbrella.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,530
Ai.

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,200
Deputy editor?

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,700
Are you all right?

12
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,000
Yeah.

13
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,230
Uh, this.

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,350
Thanks.

15
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,050
What, you can't come today?

16
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:28,230
Yeah, I'm not feeling well.

17
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,950
Are you all right?

18
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,680
Yeah, I'm sorry.

19
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,580
You don't have to worry about me.

20
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,600
Get some rest, okay?

21
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:41,170
Thanks.

22
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:45,630
I'll make it up to you soon. I promise.

23
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,650
Good morning.

24
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:09,150
You caught a cold?

25
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:11,130
No, I'm fine.

26
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,300
Good morning.

27
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,650
Good morning.

28
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,650
You look cool today.

29
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,670
Ai.

30
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:33,460
Good morning.

31
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,050
Miyagi.

32
00:02:35,050 --> 00:02:36,800
Can you confirm that for me?

33
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,030
What should I confirm...

34
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,780
Just confirm that.

35
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,050
Confirm... Okay.

36
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:47,780
Morning.

37
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,280
Oh, so beautiful.

38
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,730
I know.

39
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,310
Jackson.

40
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,000
Good morning.

41
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,930
A cold?

42
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,600
No, just a little coughing.

43
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,200
Really?
Yeah.

44
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,250
You're lying.

45
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,800
No. I'm fine.

46
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,440
Good luck.
Thanks.

47
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,300
Well...

48
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,730
This is Most Japan.

49
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,120
What is it?

50
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,030
No, nobody called, right?

51
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:40,260
Hey.

52
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,270
Jackson?

53
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,510
Yes?

54
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,070
Take this.
(Cold Cure)
(Cold Cure)

55
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,490
I don't have a cold.

56
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,370
You can never be too careful.

57
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,790
Thanks.

58
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,070
Oh, and this...

59
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:03,250
Okay.

60
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,280
It's said that masks are more effective
when they are worn in layers.

61
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,250
Thanks!

62
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,570
Sato!
Yes?

63
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,660
Can you bring this to the studio?

64
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,190
Okay.

65
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,230
And...

66
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,880
Take off that stupid mask and go.

67
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:42,290
She looks better with that
mask, doesn't she?

68
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:44,520
Huh?

69
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,610
I mean, what are you doing here?

70
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,750
Nothing.

71
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,320
Welcome.

72
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,550
Sorry to keep you waiting.

73
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:03,550
Okay. Thanks.

74
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,920
Sorry. Thank you!

75
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,410
I'm sorry!

76
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:08,680
Thank you. Sorry. Thank you.

77
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,640
Thank you.

78
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,040
Thanks!

79
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,720
Sir! Are you okay?

80
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,640
I'm sorry, sir! Are you hurt?

81
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,860
Sir, what are you doing?

82
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:12,030
Yeah, what am I doing...

83
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,570
I'm so tired.

84
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,190
She's still moving around?
With a cold...

85
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:43,810
-Hi.
-Hi.

86
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,060
Why the onion?

87
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,150
Excuse me.

88
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,200
(Onions are effective against colds.)

89
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:20,050
Onions can weaken the cold virus.

90
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,190
So the onion...

100
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,690
Thank you very much for your help.

101
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:34,390
Komatsu, did you send the PDF of the
feature manuscript to the home country?

102
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,600
I sent it this morning.

103
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,380
Azuma, I'm leaving this afternoon, so

104
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:39,660
please respond when you hear from
the coordinator of the New York shoot.

105
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,720
I will contact them as soon as possible.

106
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,620
Satonaka, how about the storyboard
for the solo travel feature?

107
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,180
I'm having our deputy editor check it out.

108
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,180
How's the lease going on the
cosmetics for the tie-up?

109
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,840
I just contacted the person in charge.

110
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,340
Higuchi. That's the one, isn't it?

111
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,430
What do you mean?

112
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,090
You know that.

113
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,490
Satonaka!

114
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,080
Yes?

115
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,550
Here are the materials for the solo
travel feature you asked for.

116
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:58,990
Wow, these many? Thank you so much!

117
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,730
I'll do my best for the location hunting.

118
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:01,700
I'm rooting for you.

119
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:02,890
Thanks.

120
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,490
Oh, this...
Hey, General Affairs!

121
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,230
Yes?

122
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:25,540
Did you refill the copy paper?

123
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,540
Oh, not yet. I'll get right on it.

124
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,480
What are you doing?

125
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,870
What if we need a printout in a hurry!

126
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,060
I'm so sorry.

127
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:34,760
It's because you're always so careless

128
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,700
that you can never become
a full-fledged person.

129
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,950
I can't trust you with
work if you're like that.

130
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,250
What was that? He shouldn't be so angry.

131
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,570
Don't worry about it.

132
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,310
He must be lacking calcium.

133
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,400
Satonaka.

134
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:52,800
Get some dried fish and give it to him.

135
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,940
Soybeans are good, too.

136
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:57,050
Maybe I'll make him a lunch
box for location hunting.

137
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,790
I'm sorry about the other day.

138
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,270
Yeah, I got all dressed up for that.

139
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,880
We agreed to meet today.

140
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,680
I know it's short notice,

141
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,760
but I wanted to ask you to
pretend to be my fiance again.

142
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:39,240
Why do you have to lie?

143
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,880
You like him, right?

144
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,000
That's not it.

145
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,940
It's just that I'm confused.

146
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:47,920
About what?

147
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,380
Until now,

148
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,710
I've thought that all men were the same.

149
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,750
It doesn't make a difference who I date.

150
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,820
Are you confused because
that person is not like that?

151
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,390
I wonder what I have done.

152
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:10,390
This has never happened to me before.

153
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,700
What can I say?

154
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,500
I don't want to feel like this anymore.

155
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,360
So you'd rather

156
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,630
just put an end to it yourself.

157
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,780
That's love, right?

158
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:28,930
But...

159
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,980
Because he is the one I can't fall in love with.

160
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,420
Is there anyone like that?

161
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,570
Yes, there is.

162
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,050
It's complicated.

163
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,430
You're the one complicating
things, aren't you?

164
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,010
Huh?

165
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:46,910
It's just...

166
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,070
If you like him, you can like him.

167
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,980
If you don't want to let go, don't let go.

168
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,670
If you don't want to regret it,
why don't you just go for it?

169
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:58,810
You don't have to lie.

170
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:07,550
Well, I'm just saying I think so.

171
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,710
If you want to end this
already, I'll back you up.

172
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,850
That's what I promised.

173
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,770
Guys, can I have a word?

174
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,350
It's about Satonaka...

175
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,530
Because of his wisdom tooth...

176
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,140
He can't speak in such a situation.

177
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,380
So I've decided to let him
rest today and tomorrow.

178
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,650
So what about tomorrow's location hunting
for the solo travel special?

179
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,380
I know, right?

180
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,750
Our deputy editor can't do this all alone.

181
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:53,410
Is there anyone who can go in his place?

182
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,410
I've got a lot of interviews
tomorrow, like four or five.

183
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,290
Then?
Oh, I can't.

184
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,790
I can't be alone with the
deputy editor. Right?

185
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,140
I can go tomorrow, but

186
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,080
I have to go to the tie-up place
tomorrow to deal with some problems.

187
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,550
I'm sorry.

188
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,870
I don't know if I can communicate
well with the deputy editor.

189
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:17,950
I mean that communication
can be difficult...

190
00:13:17,950 --> 00:13:18,700
It's okay.

191
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,670
I don't mind if I go.

192
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,630
Really?

193
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,260
But I have a special interview to cover.

194
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:25,280
Then you can't go.

195
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:25,910
What can we do...

196
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,960
Who's supposed to be going?

197
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,460
Deputy editor!

198
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:35,520
Have you decided who's going
on location hunting?

199
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:38,000
Yes! It's perfect!

200
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,920
What, me?

201
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,840
Yes. The next issue will feature
solo travels on the weekends.

202
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:49,680
It's a digital project that introduces
recommended spots and travel outfits.

203
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,440
You've been supporting Satonaka,

204
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,110
so you know the gist of it, right?

205
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,930
Well, yes... Um, is this
tomorrow and the day after?

206
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,370
Yes. Two days and one-night
location hunting starting tomorrow.

207
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,280
Sorry for the short notice.

208
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,850
But you're the only one who
can pinch hit for Satonaka.

209
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:08,300
Please!

210
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,140
Okay...

211
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,170
Aren't you stirring too much?

212
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,740
Natto should be stirred a hundred times.

213
00:14:37,170 --> 00:14:37,820
It's common sense.

214
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,830
A hundred times?

215
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,530
I feel your obsession with natto.

216
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,850
It's done!

217
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,660
All right. You're gonna eat, right?

218
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,980
No, I'm not.

219
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:49,610
What?

220
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,630
I borrowed this rice cooker from
the recipe book's editorial department.

221
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,420
Why don't you just eat at home?

222
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,930
Because I want to eat with you.

223
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,370
Okay? Come on!

224
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,130
Do me a favor and thank
me for the cold medicine.

225
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,910
Please, is this what you want?

226
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:04,840
Well...

227
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:06,940
Okay, I guess I'll make three requests.

228
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,980
This is the first.

229
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,660
Okay, start from seventy-eight.

230
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,510
I got it.

231
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:19,990
Seventy-eight, seventy-nine, eighty...

232
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,200
Hey, what's with the onion?

233
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,720
It's said to be good for colds.

234
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,370
Ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred!

235
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,440
Well done.

236
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,770
This is the best natto!

237
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,230
Here you go.

238
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:01,890
Bon appetite!

239
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,940
Wow, it's so good!

240
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:07,620
Right?

241
00:16:12,190 --> 00:16:13,950
You're not going to be here tomorrow?

242
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:15,150
Yeah.

243
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,810
I hope the deputy editor is in a good mood.

244
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:21,940
He was angry today.

245
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:23,600
I always piss him off.

246
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:28,070
Aren't you going to tell him the truth?

247
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,150
Huh?

248
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:32,260
Like "I'm your childhood friend."

249
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,920
Or "You're my first love!"

250
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,560
No, I won't do that.
It's too late now.

251
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,300
Why not?

252
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,840
Maybe he'll be nicer
to you if you tell him.

253
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:44,130
No, I might piss him off more.

254
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,880
I'm fine with the way it is.

255
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:48,950
The way it is...

256
00:16:49,610 --> 00:16:49,930
Huh?

257
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,380
Nothing.

258
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,260
Oh, no!

259
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,840
Huh? What?

260
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:05,120
You'll be late?

261
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,390
I'm sorry!

262
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,420
He's coming at 20:00, right?

263
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,610
I'll be there by then.

264
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,600
Okay.

265
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,920
If you don't want to regret it,
why don't you just go for it?

266
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:20,210
You don't have to lie.

267
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,620
That's impossible.

268
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,000
Today, I'll put an end to this.

269
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,340
Ai.

270
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,250
Why? It's not our appointment time yet.

271
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,980
I arrived early.

272
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:39,630
Are you hungry?

273
00:17:39,690 --> 00:17:41,510
Oh, yeah!

274
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,180
What would you like to eat?

275
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,000
What? What?

276
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,640
Ai?
Huh?

277
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:50,600
Ah.

278
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:52,840
Sosuke.

279
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,370
Now?

280
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,060
What shall we eat?

281
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,030
Maybe omelet rice.

282
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,950
So, after that...

283
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,280
Frisbee?

284
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:08,860
Huh?

285
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,620
That was fun, right?

286
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,540
Yeah.

287
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:17,420
It was fun.

288
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,920
I'm so sorry about the other day.

289
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,970
Are you feeling okay?

290
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:28,730
Yeah.

291
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:32,400
Also, sorry for the rush today.

292
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,770
I have a business trip tomorrow.

293
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,850
Business trip? To where?

294
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,510
Chiba to Kanagawa. A location hunting
for the solo travel special.

295
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,650
Oh, that sounds fun.

296
00:18:42,970 --> 00:18:45,850
Well, I don't know.

297
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:50,490
Is something bothering you?

298
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,040
No.

299
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:56,030
There is a staff with the same name as yours.

300
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,160
I'm going with that staff on this trip.

301
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,650
When I'm with her,

302
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,000
things always keep going
the way that I don't expect.

303
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:10,220
So I'm worried about tomorrow.

304
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,280
I see.

305
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:29,600
Because he now thinks my best friend
is his childhood friend, Sato Ai.

306
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:32,010
Because he is the one
I can't fall in love with.

307
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,120
No way.

308
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,450
What's wrong?

309
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,270
Nothing.

310
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,930
Take care of yourself on
the business trip.

311
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,920
Thanks.

312
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,120
Excuse me.

313
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,240
(I'll get there about half an hour earlier.)
Sorry, I can't come today.

314
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,100
Let's go.

315
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,850
Okay.

316
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,840
(Editor's Weekend Trip)

317
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,380
It's because you're always so careless

318
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:28,890
that you can never become
a full-fledged person.

319
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:32,410
I can't trust you with
work if you're like that.

320
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,330
I'm back!

321
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:42,430
Welcome back. Have you eaten?

322
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:44,110
I've already eaten. Sorry.

323
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:46,160
It's nothing to apologize for.

324
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:48,410
Yeah.

325
00:20:54,430 --> 00:20:57,350
Due to short notice,
I'm on a business trip tomorrow.

326
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,690
I see.

327
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:03,310
You're lonely, right?

328
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,430
I'm going to sleep with you today.

329
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:12,980
It's not that I'm lonely or anything...

330
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,410
I'm lonely!

331
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,150
The bed is a little crowded and
you have to put up with it.

332
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,050
Okay.

333
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:30,680
Tomorrow's business trip,
I'm going with Sosuke.

334
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,470
Oh, really?

335
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,370
Honestly, I'm a bit disturbed.

336
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,300
I'm afraid I'll piss him off again.

337
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,490
And what if he finds out who I am?

338
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:48,430
But I've decided that I'm
going to work hard at Most.

339
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:54,690
I'd like to do my best at both
proposing and location hunting.

340
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,550
I see.

341
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,380
Yeah.

342
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:02,920
Good night.

343
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,710
But still, that's the thing!

344
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,540
A solo weekend trip!
That's a great idea!

345
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,270
Yeah.

346
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:38,510
Like hotels where women can stay
alone, and courses to enjoy.

347
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,050
This kind of planning is really
like Satonaka's style.

348
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,440
Yeah.

349
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,200
Satonaka also makes his
own lunch every day!

350
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,550
That's amazing, right?

351
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,350
Hey.
Yes?

352
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,420
The signal's changing.

353
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:00,220
Oh, yes.

354
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,860
The first place is a flower garden
full of beautiful flowers.

355
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:18,100
It's easy to get to and open long hours,

356
00:23:18,210 --> 00:23:19,540
so many people come here alone.

357
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,350
It's so colorful and beautiful!

358
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,320
Yeah.

359
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,010
Right?

360
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:33,990
It is said to be a beneficial shrine for
both marriages and romantic achievements.

361
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,980
There are many kinds of good luck
charms and votive tablets,

362
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,910
and they're popular
because they're so cute.

363
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,490
All girls.

364
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,620
I think this will make it easier
for people to come alone.

365
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:47,530
Really?

366
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,290
This baumkuchen is number one in sales.

367
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:58,210
It seems that many single visitors
buy them for themselves.

368
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:02,080
What do you think? Want one?

369
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:03,800
Yeah.

370
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,800
This is too awkward.

371
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,190
I think he's still mad at me.

372
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:31,090
But he gave me the onion...

373
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,720
I'll be driving.

374
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,090
Um, thank you for this!

375
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:00,790
Fifty meters ahead, to your left.

376
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,300
The road is so narrow.
Is this the right direction?

377
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:21,460
You are good at driving.

378
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:24,490
I'm just average.

379
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,310
I thought you didn't drive
a car or a motorcycle.

380
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,790
Oh, no, I mean...

381
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,670
You looked like a bad driver.

382
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,700
What? Why?

383
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,100
Oh, you just looked like that.

384
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,390
Are you trying to pick a fight?

385
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,200
No way. This is not like you.

386
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:52,400
What happened?

387
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:07,700
This road is so bad! No one can
drive on such a narrow road.

388
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,480
Sorry, I don't look like a good driver.

389
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:20,810
Call someone to come and help.

390
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,760
There's nobody here.

391
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:25,200
Road service could be here in an hour.

392
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,040
An hour...

393
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,790
Please step on the gas to help me.

394
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:35,760
What?

395
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:36,980
I'm gonna push.

396
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,480
No, that's impossible!

397
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,670
Oh, come on!

398
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,820
You can't be serious.

399

One more time. Ready!

404
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,850
Do you need to say that?

405
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,730
What? Do you have a better shout?

406
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,290
No, that's not what I meant.

407
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,660
Well, then.

408
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:39,430
Ready!

409
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,040
Ready!

410
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:50,290
Wow!

411
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:55,580
All right. Now we can
press the gas pedal.

412

413
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,180

414
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,080
Hey.

415
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,090
It's not funny.

416
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,430
I'm sorry.

417
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:19,140
Oh, I'll get wet if I don't lift them.

418
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,350
It's so cold.

419

What are you doing, deputy editor?

420
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:41,890
What do you think? I'm working.

421
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,920
It feels good.

422
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,770
I hope it's not too sticky...

423
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:52,800
Hurry up!

424
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,000
Come on!

00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,670
It's so cold!

427
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,660
You'll get wet.

428
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,180
You tell me.

429
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,570
It's beautiful.

430
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:34,070
Don't you feel like writing a letter?

431
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:36,670
Letter?

432
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:39,260
When I travel alone and
see beautiful scenery,

433
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:43,270
I feel that it would be a waste
to keep it all to myself.

434
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:46,790
At times like that, I feel like writing a letter.

435
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,870
I can write to my family, friends,

436
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,950
my past self or my future self.

437
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,850
Emails and phone calls are fine,

438
00:30:54,850 --> 00:30:56,830
but there is something that
only letters can offer.

439
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:01,540
The feel of the paper and
the smell of the ink.

440
00:31:02,430 --> 00:31:05,430
The one who received it can also feel the
temperature of the person who wrote it.

441
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,470
That's right! Because it stays with you,

442
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,800
you can read it again and again,
and it's easy to remember.

443
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:18,590
Yeah.

444
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:24,420
I once had a letter that saved my life, too.

445
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,250
When I first moved abroad,

446
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,030
I didn't know anyone, and
I didn't speak the language.

447
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:37,990
There was a time when it
was pretty hard for me.

448
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:40,830
But...

449
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:46,390
There was one friend who
wrote to me from Japan.

450
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,720
(Sato Ai: I'll write to you again!)

451
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,220

I'm used to it here.

454
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,860
To write back to her,

455
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,770
I tried to endure and persevere.

456
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,000
I see.

That might be a good idea.

Huh?

462
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:26,410
Actually, I've been wondering if I
could make it a stronger title.

463
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:27,790
Title?

464
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,780
A digital and print project requires

465
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:34,320
ingenuity to create maximum synergy
between the two media, right?

466
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:39,270
I want an idea that will capture the
reader's attention at a glance.

467
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,650
And this title might

468
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:44,810
(A solo trip that makes you want to write a letter.)
make more sense than I thought.

469
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:48,090
By reminding people of the benefits
of paper through the item of a letter,

470
00:32:48,090 --> 00:32:50,910
we can lead digital readers to print media.

471
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:55,820
It would be nice if we could introduce
spots where people can write letters slowly.

472
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,080
Maybe a terrace seat at a cafe
overlooking this view.

00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,780
He said he liked the new title
and the addition of the cafe.

504
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:05,620
That's nice.

505
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,160
Then let him check out
the cafes on the list.

506
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,800
Okay!

507
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,190
Thanks!

508
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:13,400
Please take your time.

509
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,060
Rocket pencils! So nostalgic.

510
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,590
It still exists?

511
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,540
Everyone took this to
elementary school, right?

512
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,610
There were also roller erasers
and kneaded erasers.

513
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:33,120
What else?

514
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,620
Well...

515
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,870
Not stationery, but that...

516
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,480
What's it called?

517
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:40,500
It's like a notebook where

518
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,600
you can ask others to write their
names, hobbies, and other things.

519
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,000
Oh!

520
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,420
Profile books!

521
00:35:48,290 --> 00:35:51,200
I wasn't the type to get along
with girls and talk to them,

522
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,840
so I was a little jealous that all
the boys were asked to write.

523
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,090
But...

524
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,180
I wrote one once.

525
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,510
Ai, this.

526
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,720
(Profile)
You wrote it for me. Thank you.

527
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:20,140
(Love Talk)

528
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,800
(Is there someone you like?)

529
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:22,980
(Yes, there is.)

530
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:33,250
What did you write in that profile book?

531
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,610
What was it?

532
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:43,070
Harry Potter!

533
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,160
There was a question asking
about the favorite movie.

534
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:48,550
I see.

535
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,230
Didn't you like Harry Potter?

536
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:54,090
I like it a lot. I even read the novels.

537
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:55,570
Those books are very thick.

538
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,260
Which one is your
favorite in the series?

539
00:36:58,730 --> 00:37:01,720
The Philosopher's Stone in terms of the
excitement of reading it for the first time.

540
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,560
But I think my favorite is the Goblet of Fire.

541
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,580
We're the same! A match between
the three schools of magic!

542
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:09,450
It's the best!
You're right.

543
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,110
Hi.

544
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:30,500
Hi.

545
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,170
Did you solve that problem?

546
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:35,010
Yeah. Is the feature article ready?

547
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:35,700
Yes, it's done.

548
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,690
What time will the deputy editor
and Jackson be back?

549
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:42,810
They won't be back today.

550
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:45,380
They have a few more places to visit tomorrow,
so they have to spend the night there.

551
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:46,570
What?

552
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:48,570
No!

553
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:52,680
Okay.

554
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:54,490
This should do it.

555
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,680
Let's start eating.
Okay!

556
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:13,020
What are you doing?

557
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,680
I don't like it. It's too dry.

558
00:38:23,530 --> 00:38:25,300
I don't like it. It's too dry.

559
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:28,880
Huh?

560
00:38:29,230 --> 00:38:30,040
Nothing.

561
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:34,780
By the way, what other novels do you read?

562
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:39,380
I like Kusunose Rin's works
and read them often.

563
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,400
Oh, that mysterious masked novelist!

564
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,320
(The City of Spades)
Oh, that mysterious masked novelist!
(Kusunose Rin)
Oh, that mysterious masked novelist!

565
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:42,620
(Kusunose Rin)

566
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,980
I remember it was a hit in
New York before Japan.

567
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:46,200
It's like reimportation.

568
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,450
But Kusunose's gender, age, and face
are all undisclosed, right?

569
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,870
People don't even know
if Kusunose is Japanese.

570
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,610
Yeah, but I think Kusunose is Japanese.

571
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,860
Kusunose's novels are more appealing
when read in Japanese than in English.

572
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,310
I'm sure Kusunose thinks in Japanese
and then translates it into English.

573
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,460
Wow!

574
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,870
Every time I read Kusunose's novels,

575
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,340
they reminded me of Japan and
made me want to go home.

576
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,020
It's great that you came back.

577
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,610
Yeah.

578
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,270
I'm so glad.

579
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,530
Huh?

580
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:27,830
Oh, nothing.

581
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:03,660
(Ishizuka: Let's go get a drink.)

582
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,410
You haven't contacted me in
a while. Let's meet soon.

583
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,630
This...

584
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:36,480
I was thinking about the day
we did the puzzle together,

585
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:39,790
and I couldn't wait to see you.

586
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,550
It's not me, right?

587
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:18,930
It's a little late,

588
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:25,390
but I want to return this to you.

589
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:30,710
And...

590
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,720
I want to thank you for that day.

591
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,690
It's all right. Don't worry.

592
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:45,750
That's okay.

593
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:52,460
My mother died when I
was in elementary school.

594
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,380
Because of an accident on a rainy day.

595
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,200
Since then, when I see an
accident on a rainy day,

596
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,950
I sometimes become like that.

597
00:42:05,650 --> 00:42:07,520
You know how rotating
warning lights flicker, right?

598
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,600
I don't like it.

599
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,070
Oh, I see.

600
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:22,130
You don't know why I'm
telling you this, right?

601
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:23,170
Not at all.

602
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:42,580
It's going to be a beautiful day tomorrow.

603
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:48,510
Hey, look.

604
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:51,270
It's a beautiful day tomorrow.

605
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:57,710
In the past...

606
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:00,790
There was a girl who said
the same thing to me.

607
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,080

always smiled like this.

00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:35,420
Maybe nothing had changed at all.

Hey, Sato. A moment.

Aren't they getting along?

648
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:43,130

I quit.

649
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:45,500
(Ai will be fired?)
It was a short time, but it was fun.

I don't know why I fell in love with him.

655
00:46:01,250 --> 00:46:03,430
I hate being deceived the most.

656
00:46:03,550 --> 00:46:05,210
I can finally relax.
