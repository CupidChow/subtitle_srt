1
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:16,847
(Is it bang for the buck...)

2
00:00:16,848 --> 00:00:18,148
(or an emotional value?)

3
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,157
(Stir-fried pork...)

4
00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:21,957
(or pork cutlet?)

5
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:23,257
(After making the choice...)

6
00:00:23,258 --> 00:00:25,027
(Exultation...)

7
00:00:25,028 --> 00:00:26,997
(and regret)

8
00:00:26,998 --> 00:00:28,958
(Anguish and resolution)

9
00:00:29,298 --> 00:00:32,598
(The time of abundance)

10
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,768
(For modern people who suffer from such a dilemma)

11
00:00:35,268 --> 00:00:42,177
(The menu conflict agents, Handsome Guys)

12
00:00:42,178 --> 00:00:44,007
(It starts again today.)

13
00:00:44,008 --> 00:00:45,008
(Mount Acha Harmony Garden)

14
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:48,818
(Mount Acha)

15
00:00:49,988 --> 00:00:54,087
(One day in May that's filled with the smell of greenery)

16
00:00:54,088 --> 00:00:55,857
- The weather is so beautiful. Look. - Hello.

17
00:00:55,858 --> 00:00:58,057
How can it look so green?

18
00:00:58,058 --> 00:00:59,558
(Handsome Guys have gathered at Mount Acha.)

19
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,028
This is lovely.

20
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,668
The weather is amazing. Do you smell the grass?

21
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:05,527
Little kids are already...

22
00:01:05,528 --> 00:01:06,528
- Right. - They're on an outing.

23
00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:08,037
So many kids from kindergarten are here.

24
00:01:08,038 --> 00:01:09,667
Yes, they still keep coming right now.

25
00:01:09,668 --> 00:01:10,867
They're coming one after the other.

26
00:01:10,868 --> 00:01:12,437
You have to come out in this weather.

27
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:13,877
(A perfect sunny day for a picnic)

28
00:01:13,878 --> 00:01:14,907
- It's so lovely. - Right.

29
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,677
Are we the only ones today, or is someone else coming?

30
00:01:16,678 --> 00:01:19,347
I heard that we have a guest today.

31
00:01:19,348 --> 00:01:20,348
Really?

32
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:22,117
I've never met him before,

33
00:01:22,118 --> 00:01:23,418
- but all of you know him. - Really?

34
00:01:23,888 --> 00:01:24,888
Yes.

35
00:01:25,888 --> 00:01:27,058
- Who is it? - Come out if you think it's you.

36
00:01:27,618 --> 00:01:28,618
Okay.

37
00:01:30,128 --> 00:01:32,257
(The one who gave this powerful reply is...)

38
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,027
I think it's me. This is Dex.

39
00:01:34,028 --> 00:01:35,427
- Hello. - Salute.

40
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,597
- Hello. - Please stand in the middle.

41
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:38,498
- Come to the center. - His muscles are very...

42
00:01:38,868 --> 00:01:40,238
- He has a nice body. - Hello.

43
00:01:40,598 --> 00:01:42,267
- Goodness. - Fax... No, that's not him.

44
00:01:42,268 --> 00:01:43,437
- "Fax?" - His name isn't Fax.

45
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:44,867
- "Fax?" - Dex.

46
00:01:44,868 --> 00:01:46,907
Yes, I'm Dex, not Fax. Nice to meet you.

47
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:48,608
- It's Dex. - Dex is like our little brother.

48
00:01:50,008 --> 00:01:52,377
(Who will stir up Handsome Paradise)

49
00:01:52,378 --> 00:01:54,878
(The real heartthrob has arrived!)

50
00:01:55,678 --> 00:01:58,047
(The standard manly man...)

51
00:01:58,048 --> 00:02:01,018
(charged with powerful masculine beauty)

52
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:06,558
(Jung Ah!)

53
00:02:07,258 --> 00:02:12,068
(The sweet and charming guy who wins older women's hearts)

54
00:02:12,768 --> 00:02:15,598
(Armed with charms to win over women's hearts)

55
00:02:15,938 --> 00:02:19,737
(An enchanting man, Dex)

56
00:02:19,738 --> 00:02:21,437
Dex, how have you been?

57
00:02:21,438 --> 00:02:23,747
As an entertainer myself,

58
00:02:23,748 --> 00:02:25,077
- I've been working hard. - You've gone through a lot.

59
00:02:25,078 --> 00:02:27,078
Recently, I went to shoot "Adventure by Accident 4."

60
00:02:27,618 --> 00:02:30,048
- Please show a lot of love. - Right.

61
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:32,117
I heard a rumor about him.

62
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,457
- What about me? - Dex has big ambitions...

63
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,718
as an actor.

64
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:38,627
Since I'm not good enough, I'm just testing the waters.

65
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:40,797
To find out who will cast me.

66
00:02:40,798 --> 00:02:41,998
Were you in another drama recently?

67
00:02:42,158 --> 00:02:44,597
Thankfully, I played in a drama...

68
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,268
called "The Defects" last year.

69
00:02:46,428 --> 00:02:47,967
However, it hasn't been released yet.

70
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:49,037
- It hasn't been released yet? - No.

71
00:02:49,038 --> 00:02:50,607
- So I was right. - Hopefully, you can look forward...

72
00:02:50,608 --> 00:02:52,338
to watching it this year.

73
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:53,738
I can't wait to watch it.

74
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,138
- Thank you. - He's a total entertainer.

75
00:02:55,438 --> 00:02:56,637
- "Total entertainer?" - Is that right?

76
00:02:56,638 --> 00:02:57,647
What's the right word?

77
00:02:57,648 --> 00:02:58,808
You mean, all-around entertainer?

78
00:02:58,948 --> 00:03:01,277
"All-around entertainer." I'm sorry.

79
00:03:01,278 --> 00:03:02,578
I couldn't remember the word.

80
00:03:02,718 --> 00:03:04,117
- All-around. - "Total entertainer."

81
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,187
(That's how he got his new nickname.)

82
00:03:05,188 --> 00:03:07,287
Dex, do you like to eat?

83
00:03:07,288 --> 00:03:09,157
You have a nice physique, and you're thin.

84
00:03:09,158 --> 00:03:12,828
I'm the type who eats a lot at once.

85
00:03:13,228 --> 00:03:14,927
I'm the type who goes on binges.

86
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:15,928
That's not bad.

87
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:18,167
- You're perfect for our show. - Did you eat breakfast?

88
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:19,867
- I didn't eat breakfast. - You shouldn't.

89
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:21,597
- That's great. - For today,

90
00:03:21,598 --> 00:03:23,067
- You did the right thing. - I emptied out my stomach.

91
00:03:23,068 --> 00:03:24,068
That's good.

92
00:03:24,069 --> 00:03:27,277
Like friends, we play games to decide who pays for the food.

93
00:03:27,278 --> 00:03:29,407
That's part of what we do here.

94
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,647
Do you pay with your personal card?

95
00:03:30,648 --> 00:03:31,907
- With your personal card. - Right.

96
00:03:31,908 --> 00:03:33,677
We never tell our guests about that.

97
00:03:33,678 --> 00:03:35,877
It looks like the food expenses will be a lot.

98
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:37,917
- Don't you all eat well? - How much do you expect...

99
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,717
to pay for one meal?

100
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:40,718
- For three guys. - We split up.

101
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:42,688
For 3 guys, doesn't it cost about 200 dollars?

102
00:03:43,258 --> 00:03:44,657
That's how much it costs when it's the cheapest.

103
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:45,828
When it's the cheapest?

104
00:03:46,158 --> 00:03:48,357
When we had dried pollack soup, it cost about 270 dollars.

105
00:03:48,358 --> 00:03:49,558
You must eat good food.

106
00:03:49,828 --> 00:03:51,867
I'll try to win the game no matter what.

107
00:03:51,868 --> 00:03:54,067
- Let's see. - What kind of games will there be?

108
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:55,537
Instead of playing games, we take quizzes.

109
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:56,538
- Quizzes? -Quizzes.

110
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,708
- Are you good at quizzes? - I'm terrible at quizzes.

111
00:03:59,338 --> 00:04:00,707
- That's great. - That's good news.

112
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:01,708
Really?
- That's good news. - "Good news?"

113
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:04,848
Dex, have you been to Mount Acha before?

114
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:06,377
No, it's my first time here.

115
00:04:06,378 --> 00:04:07,378
- It's your first time? - Yes.

116
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:09,947
- Really? - What a great space in Seoul.

117
00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:10,987
It's in Seoul,

118
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:12,317
and it's not even far from Gangnam.

119
00:04:12,318 --> 00:04:13,347
Really?

120
00:04:13,348 --> 00:04:17,328
From seniors to young people,

121
00:04:17,628 --> 00:04:19,427
it's a nice place to hike.

122
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:20,757
(A great place for a light hike in the city)

123
00:04:20,758 --> 00:04:22,958
If you come early in the morning and hike just a little bit,

124
00:04:23,158 --> 00:04:25,167
you can catch the sunrise with a view of Seoul.

125
00:04:25,168 --> 00:04:26,667
(The mountain is located at the far east of Seoul.)

126
00:04:26,668 --> 00:04:28,538
(You can be the first one to see the sunrise in Seoul.)

127
00:04:28,798 --> 00:04:31,737
(I see.)

128
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:32,738
There are so many nice places.

129
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:34,778
It's a place with romance in the heart of the city.

130
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,577
Isn't there Seoul Children's Grand Park nearby?

131
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:39,607
Right, that's in Gwangjin-gu.

132
00:04:39,608 --> 00:04:42,047
There's Seoul Children's Grand Park in Gunja.

133
00:04:42,048 --> 00:04:43,517
(Seoul Children's Grand Park located in Gunja)

134
00:04:43,518 --> 00:04:45,447
There must be a food street nearby.

135
00:04:45,448 --> 00:04:46,518
There are also many universities.

136
00:04:46,888 --> 00:04:48,818
- Near this place... - They're everywhere.

137
00:04:49,618 --> 00:04:53,457
I'll introduce two restaurants today.

138
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:54,498
Okay.

139
00:04:54,558 --> 00:04:56,197
One of them is a tofu restaurant.

140
00:04:56,198 --> 00:04:57,497
- Tofu? - Oh, my.

141
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:58,627
- Tofu sounds good. - This place is...

142
00:04:58,628 --> 00:05:00,067
- full of hikers. - I like tofu.

143
00:05:00,068 --> 00:05:01,367
You're right.

144
00:05:01,368 --> 00:05:03,567
Near the entrance to the hiking trail,

145
00:05:03,568 --> 00:05:05,737
- there are many tofu restaurants. - Tofu and jeon.

146
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,637
The restaurant sells stir-fried pork with vegetables...

147
00:05:07,638 --> 00:05:09,538
- and stir-fried pork. - And tofu?

148
00:05:09,938 --> 00:05:11,777
There will be so much to eat.

149
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:13,948
(Tofu set meal with meat)

150
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:15,278
Tofu.
(Tofu is good.)

151
00:05:16,378 --> 00:05:18,988
Another famous restaurant is a duck stew restaurant.

152
00:05:19,388 --> 00:05:20,418
Duck stew?

153
00:05:20,758 --> 00:05:22,158
- That's nourishing. - It's good for restoring energy.

154
00:05:22,588 --> 00:05:23,688
Duck stew?

155
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:26,827
(With a rich, hearty broth, )

156
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:28,297
(duck stew is perfect for restoring energy.)

157
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:29,797
There was...

158
00:05:29,798 --> 00:05:31,998
- a very popular duck stew place... - On 26th?

159
00:05:32,228 --> 00:05:33,997
That appeared on "Hometown Flex."

160
00:05:33,998 --> 00:05:34,998
I know.

161
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:36,468
I wrote it down.

162
00:05:36,698 --> 00:05:39,038
"Among what I've tried so far,"

163
00:05:39,468 --> 00:05:41,437
"this restaurant is 1 of the top 3."

164
00:05:41,438 --> 00:05:42,477
The duck stew restaurant?

165
00:05:42,478 --> 00:05:43,478
It turns out...

166
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:44,948
that this is the branch of that famous restaurant.

167
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,347
- That's near Mount Acha? - In that case,

168
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:47,647
- it's worth trying. - Right?

169
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:48,717
It'd be worth checking out.

170
00:05:48,718 --> 00:05:50,718
(Today's LMR)

171
00:05:50,948 --> 00:05:52,617
Today's food is something...

172
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:54,818
you'd find at Namhansanseong.

173
00:05:54,988 --> 00:05:56,688
- Right. - It's tofu and duck stew.

174
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:58,128
I love both.

175
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:00,088
- Wait, I love both. - They're both really nice.

176
00:06:00,228 --> 00:06:02,027
By the way, can you do this on the show?

177
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,128
What do you mean by that?

178
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:04,797
- You can drink. - You can?

179
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:05,798
- You can. - Really?

180
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:07,468
If you want to have a drink, let me join you today.

181
00:06:07,898 --> 00:06:09,298
- None of them drink. - Really?

182
00:06:09,438 --> 00:06:11,467
If you join Yi Kyung, you'll definitely pay.

183
00:06:11,468 --> 00:06:12,468
Really?

184
00:06:12,738 --> 00:06:14,308
I don't want to pay.

185
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,437
He's really good.

186
00:06:16,438 --> 00:06:17,678
I'll go with Dong Hyun.

187
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:19,407
- If I go with Dong Hyun today, - No.

188
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:21,548
I'll be able to save money. I'll go with him.

189
00:06:21,878 --> 00:06:22,917
Goodness.

190
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:23,918
(Scratched)

191
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,687
He's the strongest away from the camera,

192
00:06:25,688 --> 00:06:28,587
but when he's inside the camera frame, he becomes weak.

193
00:06:28,588 --> 00:06:30,657
It's because all of them are really good.

194
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:32,757
- We aren't better than you. - We're all the same.

195
00:06:32,758 --> 00:06:34,627
- Dong Hyun, which will you choose? - Dong Hyun should choose.

196
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:36,198
Let me tell you about the duck stew.

197
00:06:36,928 --> 00:06:39,127
I had it several years ago in Jeolla Province,

198
00:06:39,128 --> 00:06:40,197
and I fell in love with it.

199
00:06:40,198 --> 00:06:41,198
- You can't find it in Seoul, - I see.

200
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,068
- so I'll pick the duck stew today. - Really?

201
00:06:43,198 --> 00:06:44,338
How about you, Sang Uk?

202
00:06:45,138 --> 00:06:46,168
I pick tofu.

203
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:47,977
I love stir-fried pork with tofu and vegetables.

204
00:06:47,978 --> 00:06:49,837
- Tofu is good. - So I must try their food.

205
00:06:49,838 --> 00:06:51,247
You want to taste it.

206
00:06:51,248 --> 00:06:52,347
Tofu is really good.

207
00:06:52,348 --> 00:06:53,577
It's 1 to 1. Hold on.

208
00:06:53,578 --> 00:06:54,847
Tofu, duck stew.

209
00:06:54,848 --> 00:06:55,977
(Currently, there's 1 member in each group.)

210
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:58,317
I'll go with the duck stew.

211
00:06:58,318 --> 00:06:59,517
Duck stew is very healthy.

212
00:06:59,518 --> 00:07:01,157
- Due to my budget on food, - Right.

213
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:02,888
I must join Dong Hyun no matter what.

214
00:07:04,188 --> 00:07:05,727
- Let's see. - As I said,

215
00:07:05,728 --> 00:07:07,857
I'd like to clink glasses...

216
00:07:07,858 --> 00:07:09,758
- with Dex. It's been a while. - We should have a drink.

217
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:11,427
I'll get duck stew as well.

218
00:07:11,428 --> 00:07:12,528
Oh, my.

219
00:07:12,668 --> 00:07:13,868
One of the aces joined us.

220
00:07:14,898 --> 00:07:16,568
I'll get tofu.

221
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:18,138
Why?

222
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:20,167
Who picked tofu so far?

223
00:07:20,168 --> 00:07:21,537
- Two picked tofu. - Sang Uk and Tae Hyun.

224
00:07:21,538 --> 00:07:22,577
Feel free to pick whatever you want.

225
00:07:22,578 --> 00:07:24,107
- Dong Hyun, Dex, and I picked... - It can be 4 to 2.

226
00:07:24,108 --> 00:07:25,307
- duck stew. - I made my choice.

227
00:07:25,308 --> 00:07:27,317
- Did you? - I'll get tofu.

228
00:07:27,318 --> 00:07:29,517
The meal will include meat anyway.

229
00:07:29,518 --> 00:07:30,588
Definitely.

230
00:07:30,918 --> 00:07:31,918
Okay.

231
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,717
I expected that our choices to lean towards one side.

232
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:34,787
They're balanced out.

233
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,688
- They turned out to be even. - Exactly.

234
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:40,157
Listen, I've never been wrong...

235
00:07:40,158 --> 00:07:41,927
about which dish we would eat first.

236
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:43,627
- Right. Which will we eat first? - Let me tell you.

237
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:45,127
Tae Hyun and Sang Uk, tofu will be first.

238
00:07:45,128 --> 00:07:46,297
Tofu will be first?

239
00:07:46,298 --> 00:07:48,037
- I feel it. - Will you be right again today?

240
00:07:48,038 --> 00:07:49,267
- Since we're at the mountain? - Yes.

241
00:07:49,268 --> 00:07:50,408
- So we'll eat first? - Exactly.

242
00:07:50,568 --> 00:07:51,607
I feel it.

243
00:07:51,608 --> 00:07:53,367
- It's an eight-minute walk... - He's right.

244
00:07:53,368 --> 00:07:54,508
To the tofu restaurant.

245
00:07:54,778 --> 00:07:55,878
That's Seung Ho.

246
00:07:56,978 --> 00:07:58,177
That's unbelievable.

247
00:07:58,178 --> 00:07:59,277
Did you pick it to eat first?

248
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:00,748
I smell the food on my way here.

249
00:08:01,748 --> 00:08:03,147
You're unbelievable.

250
00:08:03,148 --> 00:08:04,787
- That's incredible. - After the hike,

251
00:08:04,788 --> 00:08:06,947
people go down to the tofu restaurant.

252
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:08,887
- Let's get tofu first. - Let's go.

253
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,217
Let's go to the tofu restaurant.

254
00:08:10,218 --> 00:08:12,827
- I haven't eaten anything today. - Me neither.

255
00:08:12,828 --> 00:08:14,657
- After working out, - It'll be delicious.

256
00:08:14,658 --> 00:08:15,958
I'll be losing muscles.

257
00:08:16,858 --> 00:08:21,668
(Enjoying the clean air at Mount Acha)

258
00:08:22,898 --> 00:08:26,668
(Today's weather is perfect for hiking.)

259
00:08:27,308 --> 00:08:28,708
The weather is beautiful.

260
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:30,307
The tofu will be delicious.

261
00:08:30,308 --> 00:08:32,307
(Handsome Guys are also on a lunch outing.)

262
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:33,948
I'm really hungry.

263
00:08:34,218 --> 00:08:36,117
- Do I have to endure it? - Dex.

264
00:08:36,118 --> 00:08:37,487
We have two hours before we can eat.

265
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:39,787
Oh, no. I'm starving.

266
00:08:39,788 --> 00:08:41,017
- You must overcome it. - I do?

267
00:08:41,018 --> 00:08:43,017
Watching others eat is very difficult.

268
00:08:43,018 --> 00:08:45,128
There are many tofu restaurants.

269
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:46,728
It's a place for tofu restaurants.

270
00:08:46,888 --> 00:08:47,998
"Mount Acha Tofu?"

271
00:08:48,498 --> 00:08:51,567
- There are many tofu restaurants. - That's definitely the case.

272
00:08:51,568 --> 00:08:52,967
(Numerous tofu restaurants by the entrance of the trail)

273
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:54,138
This must be it.

274
00:08:54,198 --> 00:08:55,368
Hello.

275
00:08:55,898 --> 00:08:57,237
- Is this it? - Hello.

276
00:08:57,238 --> 00:08:59,138
This place has to be delicious. My goodness.

277
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:02,578
The first LMR is a rectangle.

278
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,147
(Fried, braised, )

279
00:09:06,148 --> 00:09:08,348
(deep-fried, stew)

280
00:09:09,478 --> 00:09:11,288
(Tofu's transformation is free of guilt.)

281
00:09:11,448 --> 00:09:14,288
(People of all ages enjoy it freely.)

282
00:09:14,488 --> 00:09:16,658
(A popular healthy tofu restaurant)

283
00:09:16,788 --> 00:09:18,957
The tofu is very soft,

284
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,757
and it's perfect to my taste.

285
00:09:20,758 --> 00:09:22,498
I come here often because the food is delicious.

286
00:09:23,128 --> 00:09:25,367
(The waiting line proves that it's a tasty restaurant.)

287
00:09:25,368 --> 00:09:26,867
The soft tofu is very savory.

288
00:09:26,868 --> 00:09:28,767
It's very delicious with soy sauce.

289
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:30,667
How shall I put this?

290
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:32,067
Hiking is just an excuse.

291
00:09:32,068 --> 00:09:33,308
We come here to eat this.

292
00:09:34,008 --> 00:09:36,238
(The pinnacle of taste)

293
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:39,248
(A must try at Mount Acha)

294
00:09:40,618 --> 00:09:43,448
(LMR 1, tofu)

295
00:09:43,578 --> 00:09:46,248
There's information on the benefits of soybeans.

296
00:09:46,988 --> 00:09:49,417
"It's an excellent source of natural protein."

297
00:09:49,418 --> 00:09:51,558
Yes, it's completely protein.

298
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:54,497
What's amazing is that...

299
00:09:54,498 --> 00:09:57,228
there's a medal for Korean cuisine maestro.

300
00:09:57,698 --> 00:09:58,997
"Korean cuisine maestro?"

301
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:01,197
They must make the tofu from scratch...

302
00:10:01,198 --> 00:10:02,838
with soybeans.

303
00:10:03,698 --> 00:10:05,207
- My goodness. - What?

304
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:06,868
There's Fischer's Ragwort Makgeolli.

305
00:10:07,638 --> 00:10:08,977
What's Fischer's Ragwort Makgeolli?

306
00:10:08,978 --> 00:10:10,137
(Fischer's Ragwort Makgeolli?)

307
00:10:10,138 --> 00:10:11,307
- That is... - Seriously?

308
00:10:11,308 --> 00:10:12,978
Inje Makgeolli from Gangwon Province.

309
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:14,717
(Fischer's ragwort is one of the typical wild greens of spring.)

310
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:16,278
Usually,

311
00:10:16,578 --> 00:10:18,717
there aren't so many different types of makgeolli.

312
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:20,117
- You're right. - They sell so many.

313
00:10:20,118 --> 00:10:21,917
- Usually, there aren't this many. - They must be sought after.

314
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:23,187
Are there these many types?

315
00:10:23,188 --> 00:10:25,257
I haven't seen Fischer's Ragwort Makgeolli in Seoul.

316
00:10:25,258 --> 00:10:26,727
I've never seen makgeolli per type.

317
00:10:26,728 --> 00:10:28,358
Can't we taste it?

318
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:31,097
We have to show off our charms...

319
00:10:31,098 --> 00:10:32,897
- We have to do something now? - Yes.

320
00:10:32,898 --> 00:10:34,367
You might have to do a handstand later.

321
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:35,598
(It won't be easy.)

322
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:38,467
- Hello, ma'am. - Hello.

323
00:10:38,468 --> 00:10:40,208
Hello, ma'am.

324
00:10:40,878 --> 00:10:42,877
- I'm curious about this the most. - Yes?

325
00:10:42,878 --> 00:10:45,478
Why do you sell so many types of makgeolli?

326
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,177
I'd like to add more makgeolli,

327
00:10:47,178 --> 00:10:49,277
- but there's not enough space. - You want to add more?

328
00:10:49,278 --> 00:10:50,847
- They're highly sought after. - Right?

329
00:10:50,848 --> 00:10:51,848
They're highly sought after?

330
00:10:51,849 --> 00:10:53,387
- Yes. - In that case,

331
00:10:53,388 --> 00:10:54,658
there must be many frequent customers.

332
00:10:54,858 --> 00:10:56,487
They probably get their favorite makgeolli here.

333
00:10:56,488 --> 00:10:57,727
Also,

334
00:10:57,728 --> 00:11:00,257
they come here for a drink after hiking.

335
00:11:00,258 --> 00:11:01,657
I've never seen Fischer's Ragwort Makgeolli in Seoul.

336
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:03,597
Do you make the tofu from scratch?

337
00:11:03,598 --> 00:11:04,698
Yes, we do.

338
00:11:05,168 --> 00:11:07,198
- Then it's handmade tofu. - Yes, it's handmade tofu.

339
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:10,067
- When we order, - That sounds good.

340
00:11:10,068 --> 00:11:12,967
- we get to eat freshly made tofu? - Yes, it'll be fresh and warm.

341
00:11:12,968 --> 00:11:14,037
That sounds so delicious.

342
00:11:14,038 --> 00:11:15,307
What shall we order?

343
00:11:15,308 --> 00:11:16,677
Let's get an order of fermented tofu.

344
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:17,947
Fermented tofu, seafood chive jeon,

345
00:11:17,948 --> 00:11:19,207
- and pan-fried tofu. - Pan-fried tofu.

346
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,317
- With a broth? - We can add some soy sauce.

347
00:11:21,318 --> 00:11:24,347
There are stir-fried pork with tofu and stir-fried pork.

348
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:26,347
By the way, why is there ramyeon?

349
00:11:26,348 --> 00:11:27,817
What's soft tofu ramyeon?

350
00:11:27,818 --> 00:11:31,028
It's probably on the menu for me to eat.

351
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:33,927
We'd like one soft tofu,

352
00:11:33,928 --> 00:11:35,427
seafood chive jeon,

353
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,627
pan-fried tofu,

354
00:11:36,628 --> 00:11:38,627
- stir-fried pork with tofu, - Right.

355
00:11:38,628 --> 00:11:40,797
And soft tofu ramyeon, please.

356
00:11:40,798 --> 00:11:42,667
- Okay. - We'll order those first.

357
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:44,867
- I'll bring it. - No, will. Fischer's ragwort?

358
00:11:44,868 --> 00:11:47,067
Can't you give us some makgeolli for free?

359
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:48,407
We're all thirsty.

360
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,408
(Jealous)

361
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,477
Look at the makgeolli glasses.

362
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:52,548
Oh, my.

363
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,347
Without any food accompaniment,

364
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:57,747
I'd be happy with some makgeolli. Is that not allowed?

365
00:11:57,748 --> 00:12:00,017
- You know what? - Look at these.

366
00:12:00,018 --> 00:12:03,018
- Look how worn out these are. - Why did you bring four bowls?

367
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:04,488
I'll mix it for you.

368
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:08,897
It's very wet. I should dry it.

369
00:12:08,898 --> 00:12:10,398
Tae Hyun.

370
00:12:10,728 --> 00:12:11,868
You got adjusted right away.

371
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:13,797
- Hey, Dex. - Yes?

372
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:14,997
You got adjusted right away.

373
00:12:14,998 --> 00:12:17,198
We already tried it, but it never works.

374
00:12:17,308 --> 00:12:18,937
- They won't give you any food. - No?

375
00:12:18,938 --> 00:12:19,938
No.

376
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,808
Dong Hyun even wiped our shoes for food,

377
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:24,908
- but he didn't get anything. - I really tried everything.

378
00:12:25,478 --> 00:12:26,478
It doesn't work.

379
00:12:29,778 --> 00:12:31,988
People think that it will explode when you shake it.

380
00:12:32,688 --> 00:12:33,958
Gosh, there's a method.

381
00:12:34,358 --> 00:12:36,018
- Then nothing happens. - What?

382
00:12:36,658 --> 00:12:38,387
Didn't you just shake it? It doesn't explode.

383
00:12:38,388 --> 00:12:39,458
Of course not.

384
00:12:40,028 --> 00:12:41,558
Thank you.

385
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,028
- This is great. - Thank you.

386
00:12:44,068 --> 00:12:46,928
I made another mistake today. Goodness.

387
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:53,138
(Savoring the aroma first)

388
00:12:54,108 --> 00:12:55,837
Tae Hyun, shall we drink first?

389
00:12:55,838 --> 00:12:58,878
Yes, it's wonderful to drink before the meal.

390
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:04,488
(A refreshing drink before their meal)

391
00:13:05,188 --> 00:13:07,047
On top of that, their bowls are cold.

392
00:13:07,048 --> 00:13:08,258
It must taste insanely good.

393
00:13:08,718 --> 00:13:10,388
You'll understand why I like this makgeolli.

394
00:13:10,758 --> 00:13:11,788
You'll be pleasantly surprised.

395
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:13,588
What's the difference?

396
00:13:13,858 --> 00:13:15,398
All of you are makgeolli experts.

397
00:13:16,398 --> 00:13:18,398
- Tae Hyun, isn't it new? - How is it?

398
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:20,427
- This is delicious. - Right?

399
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:22,097
- It tastes very clean. - This is...

400
00:13:22,098 --> 00:13:23,938
- The taste isn't rich either. - It's clean and light.

401
00:13:24,008 --> 00:13:27,307
When you drink alcohol at a restaurant or at home,

402
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:28,737
you crave some food accompaniment with the drink.

403
00:13:28,738 --> 00:13:30,307
You crave food that goes well with your drink.

404
00:13:30,308 --> 00:13:32,307
- I can only think about tofu now. - I agree.

405
00:13:32,308 --> 00:13:33,848
- Tofu would be perfect. - Exactly.

406
00:13:34,278 --> 00:13:36,377
I've never tried Fischer's Ragwort Makgeolli before.

407
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:37,618
- Is it good? - It's very delicious.

408
00:13:38,048 --> 00:13:40,918
Isn't this rude to treat your guest like this?

409
00:13:41,488 --> 00:13:43,717
I can ask for one drink, can't I?

410
00:13:43,718 --> 00:13:45,488
- One drink isn't too much to ask. - Dex, you should...

411
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,898
We have to drink this with food, so I can't give it to you.

412
00:13:49,028 --> 00:13:50,057
What?

413
00:13:50,058 --> 00:13:51,167
Look behind you.

414
00:13:51,168 --> 00:13:52,398
There's a lot behind you.

415
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,897
- I can't give it to you. - There's a lot behind you.

416
00:13:53,898 --> 00:13:55,137
- I can't give it to you. - We'll share it.

417
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:56,438
- There's a lot behind you. - I can't give you any.

418
00:13:56,498 --> 00:13:58,267
Can the three of us play a game for a bowl of makgeolli?

419
00:13:58,268 --> 00:13:59,268
How about the loyalty game?

420
00:13:59,269 --> 00:14:00,637
The loyalty game sounds good.

421
00:14:00,638 --> 00:14:01,708
(That sounds fun.)

422
00:14:01,838 --> 00:14:04,108
- Isn't it a good idea? - As expected, Yi Kyung is smart.

423
00:14:04,548 --> 00:14:06,107
The one who comes in last place might or might not get to taste it.

424
00:14:06,108 --> 00:14:07,917
- Right. - It's hit or miss for the second.

425
00:14:07,918 --> 00:14:09,318
Perfect. This is just enough.

426
00:14:09,578 --> 00:14:11,217
Gosh, you're so generous.

427
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:12,548
I believe in your loyalty.

428
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:15,288
What should we make them do?

429
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:17,457
- You have to pick 1, 2, and 3. - Right.

430
00:14:17,458 --> 00:14:19,758
Play Game of Wits first.

431
00:14:20,728 --> 00:14:22,328
- One. - Two.

432
00:14:22,498 --> 00:14:23,927
(Frozen)

433
00:14:23,928 --> 00:14:25,998
- It's done. - You invited me here as a guest.

434
00:14:26,268 --> 00:14:28,067
No one even said "start."

435
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,597
- Is he in last place? - It was only a practice.

436
00:14:30,598 --> 00:14:32,337
- It was a practice? - He told you to practice.

437
00:14:32,338 --> 00:14:33,967
Game of Wits starts.

438
00:14:33,968 --> 00:14:35,008
- One. - Two.

439
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:36,178
Three.

440
00:14:36,478 --> 00:14:37,578
Seriously?

441
00:14:38,008 --> 00:14:39,547
(Dong Hyun comes in last.)

442
00:14:39,548 --> 00:14:41,818
Goodness.

443
00:14:41,918 --> 00:14:43,647
You should play rock-paper-scissors.

444
00:14:43,648 --> 00:14:45,387
What if I let you be the winner? Can I trust you...

445
00:14:45,388 --> 00:14:46,388
if I'm in second place?

446
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,288
Let's give it a try.

447
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:51,858
I'll play rock. If you play paper, it'll mean that I trust you.

448
00:14:52,388 --> 00:14:53,527
Okay.

449
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:54,697
I trust you.

450
00:14:54,698 --> 00:14:56,198
- Will you trust me? - I trust you.

451
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:59,797
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

452
00:14:59,798 --> 00:15:02,298
(Yelling)

453
00:15:02,498 --> 00:15:05,638
The look on his face was genuine.

454
00:15:06,168 --> 00:15:08,237
Is this how you mistreat your guests?

455
00:15:08,238 --> 00:15:11,177
- This is how we do it. - Is this how this show runs?

456
00:15:11,178 --> 00:15:14,007
Dex didn't curse, but the look on his face...

457
00:15:14,008 --> 00:15:16,518
I see. I didn't know how things worked here.

458
00:15:17,018 --> 00:15:18,288
That completely woke me up.

459
00:15:19,188 --> 00:15:21,017
- Thank you. I won first place. - He's so naive.

460
00:15:21,018 --> 00:15:22,818
With such an innocent face...

461
00:15:23,388 --> 00:15:25,557
- Dex should get a sip. - Of course.

462
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,757
- Dex should get a sip. - I should too. I'm in third place.

463
00:15:27,758 --> 00:15:29,327
I'm not eliminated.

464
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:30,898
Don't even think about it.

465
00:15:31,028 --> 00:15:32,168
Just drink some water.

466
00:15:33,668 --> 00:15:35,797
(Gulping)

467
00:15:35,798 --> 00:15:36,938
He's drinking so much.

468
00:15:37,638 --> 00:15:39,307
That's enough.

469
00:15:39,308 --> 00:15:41,278
- You might as well... - I left you a lot.

470
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:43,007
- That's a lot. - I left you a lot.

471
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:44,038
It's enough for one sip.

472
00:15:44,448 --> 00:15:45,908
- I'll drink some. - This is...

473
00:15:46,978 --> 00:15:48,478
- Gosh. - It's very refreshing.

474
00:15:51,048 --> 00:15:52,717
- He left some. - I knew it.

475
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:53,787
I checked the remaining amount.

476
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:56,157
(Savoring)

477
00:15:56,158 --> 00:15:57,187
I knew it.

478
00:15:57,188 --> 00:15:58,727
- It's good. - He's very loyal.

479
00:15:58,728 --> 00:15:59,728
Show them how much remains.

480
00:15:59,729 --> 00:16:01,197
- Let me see. - It's enough for a taste.

481
00:16:01,198 --> 00:16:03,228
There's enough.

482
00:16:03,758 --> 00:16:04,767
It should be enough.

483
00:16:04,768 --> 00:16:06,368
(Drinking up)

484
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:10,698
(Exhaling with satisfaction)

485
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:13,667
Only I could feel the sensation of emptying the bowl.

486
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:14,678
This is it.

487
00:16:16,038 --> 00:16:17,277
There was a lot left.

488
00:16:17,278 --> 00:16:18,978
(Team Duck Stew verified their strong sense of loyalty.)

489
00:16:19,378 --> 00:16:21,078
- The food is here. - Here it comes.

490
00:16:21,148 --> 00:16:24,077
(What will be the first dish to arrive?)

491
00:16:24,078 --> 00:16:25,188
The tray is full.

492
00:16:25,248 --> 00:16:26,518
The amount is generous.

493
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:28,117
That's soft tofu ramyeon.

494
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:30,087
- It's not what I expected. - Is it ramyeon or soft tofu?

495
00:16:30,088 --> 00:16:31,127
Gosh, what's this?

496
00:16:31,128 --> 00:16:32,388
This looks amazing.

497
00:16:32,588 --> 00:16:34,528
- I'm salivating. - This is really...

498
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:36,397
It's pan-fried tofu.

499
00:16:36,398 --> 00:16:37,798
This is it.

500
00:16:37,868 --> 00:16:39,268
That looks authentic.

501
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,727
- Thank you. - What's this?

502
00:16:40,728 --> 00:16:43,197
It has the same color as shrimp toast.

503
00:16:43,198 --> 00:16:44,508
Pan-fried tofu? Goodness.

504
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,478
(Korean soybeans are ground in a grinder.)

505
00:16:49,238 --> 00:16:52,878
(Solidify the soybean water...)

506
00:16:53,348 --> 00:16:58,148
(and press it into a mold.)

507
00:16:58,748 --> 00:17:02,418
(Straight and rectangular tofu is ready.)

508
00:17:02,858 --> 00:17:06,428
(When served with complementary stir-fried pork with vegetables)

509
00:17:06,628 --> 00:17:12,628
(Delicious and healthy tofu set meal)

510
00:17:13,268 --> 00:17:15,267
Tae Hyun, which one would you like to start with?

511
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,368
- Shall I start with the soft tofu? - That looks amazing.

512
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,668
I love that.

513
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:22,778
Do I add this to the soft tofu?

514
00:17:23,638 --> 00:17:24,748
The sauce.

515
00:17:26,348 --> 00:17:28,218
(Add soy sauce as much as you want)

516
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:30,578
- Gosh, soft tofu. - I can't breathe.

517
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:36,318
(A big spoonful)

518
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,988
(Yum)

519
00:17:38,388 --> 00:17:41,797
(Seung Ho tastes it without soy sauce.)

520
00:17:41,798 --> 00:17:43,058
I can smell it.

521
00:17:43,598 --> 00:17:45,227
It's very soft as is.

522
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:46,268
It's making me...

523
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:48,968
- It's delicious as is. - It really is.

524
00:17:49,038 --> 00:17:50,537
- How is it different? - I should've picked tofu.

525
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:51,707
Is it different?

526
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:55,278
This is extremely savory.

527
00:17:56,738 --> 00:17:58,247
Like the sauce for soybean noodles?

528
00:17:58,248 --> 00:18:00,477
- I made a mistake. - I should've picked tofu.

529
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:02,848
I'm a huge fan of tofu, but today...

530
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:07,588
Instead of being mushy,

531
00:18:07,618 --> 00:18:10,018
- the soft tofu is chewy. - It's chewy?

532
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:13,827
What are we eating next?

533
00:18:13,828 --> 00:18:15,557
Try this.

534
00:18:15,558 --> 00:18:16,627
Give me a piece.

535
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,097
- That's... - What's that?

536
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:19,227
It's pan-fried tofu.

537
00:18:19,228 --> 00:18:20,228
Pan-fried tofu?

538
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:22,137
Pan-fried tofu? Okay.

539
00:18:22,138 --> 00:18:23,567
It's like tofu steak.

540
00:18:23,568 --> 00:18:25,107
- Exactly. - It looks amazing.

541
00:18:25,108 --> 00:18:27,507
- Dip it in soy sauce. - There won't be enough soy sauce.

542
00:18:27,508 --> 00:18:29,938
The outside looks very crispy.

543
00:18:30,308 --> 00:18:31,448
She pan-fried it well.

544
00:18:31,608 --> 00:18:33,548
No other restaurant makes pan-fried tofu like this.

545
00:18:34,678 --> 00:18:36,348
Dip it lightly in sauce sauce.

546
00:18:36,818 --> 00:18:38,987
(Surprised)

547
00:18:38,988 --> 00:18:41,318
(It's hot.)

548
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:43,058
Tae Hyun, it must be hot.

549
00:18:43,358 --> 00:18:44,527
Give us a quiz.

550
00:18:44,528 --> 00:18:45,688
(Give us a quiz now.)

551
00:18:45,728 --> 00:18:47,488
I have to eat it when it's hot.

552
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:49,298
Today, I...

553
00:18:49,299 --> 00:18:52,598
(Instead, I'll eat it when it's hot.)

554
00:18:54,168 --> 00:18:55,837
Dong Hyun, do you want to switch teams?

555
00:18:55,838 --> 00:18:57,468
I really want to.

556
00:18:57,968 --> 00:18:59,808
I beg you. Please.

557
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:01,478
- It's very crispy. - Yes.

558
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:05,377
Shouldn't you let us taste...

559
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:06,807
- each dish? - Right.

560
00:19:06,808 --> 00:19:08,348
- Right. - One of us three.

561
00:19:08,778 --> 00:19:10,217
(He doesn't care at all.)

562
00:19:10,218 --> 00:19:12,347
- Tae Hyun, I'll try the ramyeon. - Okay.

563
00:19:12,348 --> 00:19:14,118
I can't stand it when ramyeon noodles get soggy.

564
00:19:14,288 --> 00:19:15,357
Let me try...

565
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:16,358
(Exclaiming)

566
00:19:17,728 --> 00:19:19,558
Look at this.

567
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:21,197
Gosh, I'm hungry.

568
00:19:21,198 --> 00:19:22,358
(Stunned by the stimulating sight)

569
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:23,997
Hold on. Oh, my.

570
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:25,998
- What's this? - Goodness.

571
00:19:26,728 --> 00:19:29,868
It looks like stir-fried noodles.

572
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:32,037
- Without a lot of broth. - It's like rabokki.

573
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:33,108
(Ramyeon with little broth)

574
00:19:34,238 --> 00:19:36,778
It's not the soft tofu ramyeon that I imagined.

575
00:19:37,908 --> 00:19:39,607
You should eat before the noodles get soggy.

576
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:41,247
This ramyeon looks very rich.

577
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:42,347
The noodles are coming up with soft tofu.

578
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:43,947
It's almost like ra-porridge.

579
00:19:43,948 --> 00:19:46,988
With soft tofu in the broth...

580
00:19:49,158 --> 00:19:50,288
Like this.

581
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,128
He knows exactly how to eat.

582
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,288
(Smacking his lips)

583
00:19:54,288 --> 00:19:58,467
(Slurping)

584
00:19:58,468 --> 00:19:59,868
- This is delicious. - It's good.

585
00:20:01,098 --> 00:20:02,268
(Exclaiming)

586
00:20:06,838 --> 00:20:08,008
I feel stunned.

587
00:20:08,808 --> 00:20:10,337
Hey, it's so good.

588
00:20:10,338 --> 00:20:11,648
(It's so good!)

589
00:20:11,908 --> 00:20:16,848
(In love with soft tofu ramyeon)

590
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:21,988
(Humming)

591
00:20:22,158 --> 00:20:23,318
Try it with kimchi.

592
00:20:23,588 --> 00:20:25,727
Tae Hyun never reacts like this.

593
00:20:25,728 --> 00:20:26,927
This ramyeon is completely different.

594
00:20:26,928 --> 00:20:28,427
- Tae Hyun... - It's not regular ramyeon.

595
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,167
Tae Hyun is a gourmet. His reaction like this means...

596
00:20:31,168 --> 00:20:33,068
that it's very delicious.

597
00:20:33,368 --> 00:20:35,298
This is very painful.

598
00:20:36,238 --> 00:20:38,468
It tastes like healthy rose pasta.

599
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:40,807
- It does taste like rose sauce. - Healthy rose pasta.

600
00:20:40,808 --> 00:20:42,807
Can we order a dish and divide it into three?

601
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:44,678
- No way. - Only one of you can eat.

602
00:20:44,748 --> 00:20:46,348
- Is that too much? - No way.

603
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:48,278
He's eating tofu so well.

604
00:20:48,978 --> 00:20:52,188
You know the firm type? That must be it.

605
00:20:52,248 --> 00:20:53,847
No matter...

606
00:20:53,848 --> 00:20:55,458
how good the duck stew is, I'll regret it.

607
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,117
I'm serious.

608
00:20:57,118 --> 00:20:58,457
Even if...

609
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:01,497
the duck stew is popular and amazing,

610
00:21:01,498 --> 00:21:03,528
I'll regret not eating this.

611
00:21:04,298 --> 00:21:08,867
During the military service, Dex was in the Underwater Demolition Team.

612
00:21:08,868 --> 00:21:11,307
- There's the inferno survival week. - Right.

613
00:21:11,308 --> 00:21:12,667
Didn't you starve for days?

614
00:21:12,668 --> 00:21:14,167
- For 5 days. - You starved for 5 days.

615
00:21:14,168 --> 00:21:15,207
Five days?

616
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:16,208
(In awe)

617
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:17,307
But you look like someone...

618
00:21:17,308 --> 00:21:19,078
who can't resist even for one day.

619
00:21:19,178 --> 00:21:21,977
- You really starved for five days? - It seems like...

620
00:21:21,978 --> 00:21:24,078
Now, not eating for five hours is hard.

621
00:21:24,148 --> 00:21:26,747
You wouldn't be sitting in front of food during those five days.

622
00:21:26,748 --> 00:21:27,987
(You wouldn't be sitting in front of food during those five days.)

623
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:29,487
This happened one time during that week.

624
00:21:29,488 --> 00:21:30,857
They grilled pork belly in front of you.

625
00:21:30,858 --> 00:21:31,887
- Right. - Yes, I've seen it.

626
00:21:31,888 --> 00:21:33,488
- Who eats the pork belly? - The drill instructors.

627
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:34,998
- They do it on purpose. - They send the smell.

628
00:21:35,728 --> 00:21:38,367
(UDT Special Forces Survival Training)

629
00:21:38,368 --> 00:21:41,127
(It involves strict control over food, clothing, and shelter.)

630
00:21:41,128 --> 00:21:44,138
(A training of self-sufficiency for 5 days with only 500ml of water)

631
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,667
Which one is harder? The training or now?

632
00:21:46,668 --> 00:21:48,108
It feels a little harder now.

633
00:21:48,838 --> 00:21:50,637
My stomach is hurting because of makgeolli.

634
00:21:50,638 --> 00:21:52,708
- I need some food in my stomach. - Right.

635
00:21:53,008 --> 00:21:54,547
Plus, the smell is insane.

636
00:21:54,548 --> 00:21:56,147
(Sighing)

637
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,618
We haven't started on the main dish.

638
00:21:58,648 --> 00:22:00,347
- Right. - Yes, this is the main dish.

639
00:22:00,348 --> 00:22:01,758
Before starting the main dish...

640
00:22:01,788 --> 00:22:03,158
- It's a feast. - We set a record.

641
00:22:03,218 --> 00:22:04,487
- Fermented tofu. - That is...

642
00:22:04,488 --> 00:22:05,758
Yes, fermented tofu.

643
00:22:05,828 --> 00:22:06,928
I'll try the fermented tofu by itself.

644
00:22:07,288 --> 00:22:08,457
You can grab it like that?

645
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,927
- It's very firm. - I'll try it by itself.

646
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:10,998
Is it like cheese?

647
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:12,898
- It looks like cheese. - It doesn't fall.

648
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,637
(Humming)

649
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:18,967
It's so savory.

650
00:22:18,968 --> 00:22:20,667
People who can't eat are giving so much unsolicited advice.

651
00:22:20,668 --> 00:22:21,808
(Yes)

652
00:22:21,978 --> 00:22:24,007
- This is driving me insane. - The tofu...

653
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:25,048
(This is driving me insane.)

654
00:22:25,408 --> 00:22:26,647
The tofu looks firm.

655
00:22:26,648 --> 00:22:28,078
Look, Dong Hyun.

656
00:22:28,178 --> 00:22:29,818
The tofu is pressed well.

657
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:33,447
It reminds me of hard cheese.

658
00:22:33,448 --> 00:22:35,218
- Is it called Camembert? - Yes.

659
00:22:35,618 --> 00:22:36,717
I like to eat it like this.

660
00:22:36,718 --> 00:22:38,227
It was pressed hard to remove all the liquid.

661
00:22:38,228 --> 00:22:39,357
- I put it on top. - Even if the portion is small...

662
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:40,457
That's why it's firm.

663
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:41,557
I put some on top.

664
00:22:41,558 --> 00:22:42,728
(He also puts on some meat.)

665
00:22:43,698 --> 00:22:47,228
(Eating all in one bite)

666
00:22:49,738 --> 00:22:50,797
This is so...

667
00:22:50,798 --> 00:22:52,808
- You know the regular soft tofu? - Yes.

668
00:22:53,008 --> 00:22:54,208
It's as soft as that.

669
00:22:54,238 --> 00:22:55,807
- It's very soft. - Really?

670
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:58,007
- Then why does it look so hard? - It looks hard, but...

671
00:22:58,008 --> 00:22:59,507
When you break the hard outside,

672
00:22:59,508 --> 00:23:01,147
it's very soft inside.

673
00:23:01,148 --> 00:23:02,978
(It's firm outside and soft inside.)

674
00:23:04,378 --> 00:23:05,847
(Eating)

675
00:23:05,848 --> 00:23:06,948
Look at Tae Hyun.

676
00:23:08,558 --> 00:23:11,728
It must be hard to choose.

677
00:23:11,828 --> 00:23:13,558
They enjoy the food so much...

678
00:23:14,558 --> 00:23:16,057
This is the best.

679
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:17,357
- It's so good. - It's the main dish indeed.

680
00:23:17,358 --> 00:23:19,797
(It's definitely the main dish.)

681
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:21,868
You have to eat them together.

682
00:23:21,998 --> 00:23:23,037
Tae Hyun.

683
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:24,438
Shall we do a quiz for the freeloaders?

684
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:25,667
Give us a quiz. Only for one person?

685
00:23:25,668 --> 00:23:26,937
One person for now.

686
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:29,037
Then I'll give you another famous quote quiz.

687
00:23:29,038 --> 00:23:30,637
- I hate famous quotes the most. - Famous quotes?

688
00:23:30,638 --> 00:23:32,577
- I hate famous quotes the most. - I like them.

689
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,777
This is for Dong Hyun.

690
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:35,078
(Among the three, who will get to freeload?)

691
00:23:35,478 --> 00:23:39,288
It's a famous saying by Playwright George Bernard Shaw.

692
00:23:39,988 --> 00:23:42,318
"There is no love..."

693
00:23:42,558 --> 00:23:45,087
"more sincere than the love of this."

694
00:23:45,088 --> 00:23:46,428
("There is no love more sincere than the love of this.")

695
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:48,297
(Sincere love?)

696
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:49,428
What could it be?

697
00:23:49,758 --> 00:23:51,567
It must be something unique since it's a famous quote.

698
00:23:51,568 --> 00:23:53,098
I came up with an idea.

699
00:23:53,428 --> 00:23:54,867
- This must be it. - What?

700
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:55,967
I got it.

701
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:57,167
- Books. - "Books?"

702
00:23:57,168 --> 00:23:59,208
There's no love more sincere than the love of books.

703
00:23:59,608 --> 00:24:01,068
- Incorrect. - I apologize.

704
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,707
He sounded like an adolescent.

705
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:04,878
Please.

706
00:24:05,608 --> 00:24:07,378
(I want to eat some.)

707
00:24:07,508 --> 00:24:10,218
All I can think about now is love for tofu.

708
00:24:11,018 --> 00:24:12,747
Give it a try. You never know.

709
00:24:12,748 --> 00:24:14,718
(What could it be?)

710
00:24:15,258 --> 00:24:17,988
- I'll say quickly to move on. - The chives are good.

711
00:24:18,528 --> 00:24:19,557
(No interest)

712
00:24:19,558 --> 00:24:21,698
The chives are really savory.

713
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:23,627
Tae Hyun, please eat. I have some.

714
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:25,527
- Excuse me. We're playing a game. - They aren't interested.

715
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:27,167
- Could you focus on us? - This is what we normally do.

716
00:24:27,168 --> 00:24:28,238
You aren't interested?

717
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:30,998
- This is... - It's our own league.

718
00:24:31,468 --> 00:24:32,867
I got it. I'll just say whatever.

719
00:24:32,868 --> 00:24:34,008
- Letters. - Give me some water.

720
00:24:34,308 --> 00:24:36,208
- Incorrect. - Blurt out any answer.

721
00:24:36,338 --> 00:24:37,407
I got it. Alcohol.

722
00:24:37,408 --> 00:24:41,617
(Answer: Alcohol)

723
00:24:41,618 --> 00:24:43,347
- Incorrect. - The answer must be close.

724
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:44,377
I got it.

725
00:24:44,378 --> 00:24:45,387
Blurt out anything.

726
00:24:45,388 --> 00:24:46,917
- I got it. - Dex?

727
00:24:46,918 --> 00:24:49,487
This quote is by a foreigner.

728
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,318
- Right. - His name is George.

729
00:24:51,358 --> 00:24:53,057
- Instead of alcohol, it's wine. - I got it.

730
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:54,087
Wine? Incorrect.

731
00:24:54,088 --> 00:24:55,457
- No? - Whiskey.

732
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:56,757
Whiskey is incorrect.

733
00:24:56,758 --> 00:24:58,168
- Cognac. - Cognac is incorrect.

734
00:24:58,298 --> 00:24:59,868
- What? - "Cognac?"

735
00:25:00,368 --> 00:25:01,498
Is it a type of alcohol?

736
00:25:01,938 --> 00:25:02,968
It's not.

737
00:25:03,738 --> 00:25:05,167
- Could it be wrong? - However...

738
00:25:05,168 --> 00:25:07,068
It must be a type of food.

739
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:08,637
(A type of food?)

740
00:25:08,638 --> 00:25:11,747
Is it a type of beverage?

741
00:25:11,748 --> 00:25:12,908
I got it. Desserts?

742
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,178
Desserts? Incorrect.

743
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:15,248
I got it. Food.

744
00:25:15,578 --> 00:25:17,518
- Correct. - Yes!

745
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:19,188
No one said "food?"

746
00:25:19,488 --> 00:25:20,647
We already said that.

747
00:25:20,648 --> 00:25:22,058
(Disappointed)

748
00:25:22,318 --> 00:25:24,488
I thought that someone had said it.

749
00:25:25,528 --> 00:25:29,058
Let me build a tower

750
00:25:29,698 --> 00:25:33,228
I will build a tower

751
00:25:35,238 --> 00:25:36,767
I'll put this...

752
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,997
and this.

753
00:25:37,998 --> 00:25:39,407
- It fits perfectly. - That looks good.

754
00:25:39,408 --> 00:25:40,467
(Chive jeon, meat, pan-fried tofu, and kimchi)

755
00:25:40,468 --> 00:25:42,007
I'll put this on too.

756
00:25:42,008 --> 00:25:43,108
Can you eat all that?

757
00:25:43,138 --> 00:25:44,778
What if you can't?

758
00:25:45,008 --> 00:25:46,478
- This should be enough. - Can you eat it all at once?

759
00:25:46,508 --> 00:25:47,608
That's quite big.

760
00:25:47,778 --> 00:25:49,677
- Will you eat it vertically? - This will slide...

761
00:25:49,678 --> 00:25:50,948
down the throat.

762
00:25:51,488 --> 00:25:53,187
(A rare sight)

763
00:25:53,188 --> 00:25:54,857
- How can he eat all that? - Vertically.

764
00:25:54,858 --> 00:25:55,888
Gosh.

765
00:25:56,488 --> 00:26:00,128
(Struggling)

766
00:26:00,728 --> 00:26:02,258
- Did everything go in? - How...

767
00:26:02,898 --> 00:26:04,158
- Did everything go in? - How...

768
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:06,468
- Did everything go in? - How...

769
00:26:07,028 --> 00:26:11,198
(Cleared)

770
00:26:11,298 --> 00:26:13,238
Isn't that practically one meal?

771
00:26:14,778 --> 00:26:17,978
- One meal? - Isn't that practically a meal?

772
00:26:18,648 --> 00:26:20,677
That's insane. The sound is crazy.

773
00:26:20,678 --> 00:26:23,077
He's munching on the food...

774
00:26:23,078 --> 00:26:24,278
and struggling hard to eat.

775
00:26:24,888 --> 00:26:27,387
I agree. There's no love more sincere than the love of food.

776
00:26:27,388 --> 00:26:29,417
(I agree. There's no love more sincere than the love of food.)

777
00:26:29,418 --> 00:26:32,357
Shall we ask for the bill?

778
00:26:32,358 --> 00:26:33,558
I'm curious about the total.

779
00:26:34,998 --> 00:26:37,457
Oh, my. They ordered...

780
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:38,998
- eight dishes. - Yes?

781
00:26:39,128 --> 00:26:40,398
It's only 78 dollars.

782
00:26:41,068 --> 00:26:43,297
- That's nice. - Seriously?

783
00:26:43,298 --> 00:26:45,237
- Look at all the food. - I know.

784
00:26:45,238 --> 00:26:47,907
- That's enough for 4 to 5 people. - The food must be good here.

785
00:26:47,908 --> 00:26:50,207
The bill would be less than 100 dollars even if you drink.

786
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:51,238
Seriously.

787
00:26:51,478 --> 00:26:53,547
Shall we get started?

788
00:26:53,548 --> 00:26:55,317
- With 80 dollars at stake. - Let's do it.

789
00:26:55,318 --> 00:26:56,448
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

790
00:26:57,118 --> 00:26:58,987
Among sayings related to tofu,

791
00:26:58,988 --> 00:27:01,417
there's a saying that goes "like bountiful tofu."

792
00:27:01,418 --> 00:27:02,888
"Like bountiful tofu?"

793
00:27:03,358 --> 00:27:07,257
It's a metaphor to describe someone who looks like this.

794
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:08,328
"Someone?"

795
00:27:08,528 --> 00:27:11,097
- What kind of person is this? - "Like bountiful tofu?"

796
00:27:11,098 --> 00:27:12,828
They might figure it out.

797
00:27:13,228 --> 00:27:14,527
If it's "bountiful tofu..."

798
00:27:14,528 --> 00:27:16,437
When there's a good harvest,

799
00:27:16,438 --> 00:27:17,738
we don't usually eat tofu.

800
00:27:18,438 --> 00:27:19,868
Isn't tofu a residue?

801
00:27:21,068 --> 00:27:22,107
- Why? - A residue?

802
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:23,437
- But it tastes so good. - It's a residue.

803
00:27:23,438 --> 00:27:25,007
For something that's a residue, it tastes so good?

804
00:27:25,008 --> 00:27:26,478
For something that's a residue, it tastes so good.

805
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:28,178
A residue.

806
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,848
He must have thought of biji.

807
00:27:29,878 --> 00:27:31,447
- Biji is a residue. - When making tofu...

808
00:27:31,448 --> 00:27:33,618
This might help them guess. Wait.

809
00:27:33,688 --> 00:27:35,687
- This might help them guess. - Don't tell them.

810
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:37,118
You're acting like me right now.

811
00:27:37,618 --> 00:27:39,058
I answered a few quizzes like this.

812
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,488
I forgot about biji.

813
00:27:42,398 --> 00:27:43,827
If it's someone who looks like this,

814
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:45,268
it must be a physical appearance.

815
00:27:45,628 --> 00:27:48,098
It could be related to physical appearance.

816
00:27:48,568 --> 00:27:50,897
"Bountiful tofu" can mean...

817
00:27:50,898 --> 00:27:52,938
- Is it correct? - This is...

818
00:27:53,208 --> 00:27:55,508
"Bountiful?" Why does it describe the tofu?

819
00:27:55,538 --> 00:27:58,008
There's "like poor quality tofu," which is the opposite saying.

820
00:27:58,648 --> 00:28:00,878
(Chuckling)

821
00:28:01,048 --> 00:28:02,548
Stop giving them hints.

822
00:28:03,478 --> 00:28:05,388
"Like bountiful tofu?"

823
00:28:06,448 --> 00:28:07,618
Someone who's plump?

824
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:09,618
Does the tofu refer...

825
00:28:09,888 --> 00:28:12,727
to someone who's pudgy?

826
00:28:12,728 --> 00:28:14,998
He said "someone who looks like this."

827
00:28:15,358 --> 00:28:17,098
Someone who's like Majin Buu?

828
00:28:17,298 --> 00:28:19,528
- Look, the tofu looks white. - Seriously.

829
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:22,268
- White? - They had so many daughters...

830
00:28:23,338 --> 00:28:24,668
Someone with nice skin?

831
00:28:24,908 --> 00:28:27,008
Yes, skin that's supple.

832
00:28:27,338 --> 00:28:28,338
Someone with nice skin.

833
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:29,507
- With elasticity. - Milky skin.

834
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:31,177
- Elastic. - Skin with elasticity.

835
00:28:31,178 --> 00:28:33,448
Skin that's milky and elastic.

836
00:28:33,808 --> 00:28:35,947
It must be someone who has white skin.

837
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,577
- Let's go with that. - It sounds more reasonable.

838
00:28:37,578 --> 00:28:39,948
I think it's the skin. It's someone who looks like this.

839
00:28:40,048 --> 00:28:42,057
It must be something simple.

840
00:28:42,058 --> 00:28:43,988
- Someone with milky white skin. - Very white.

841
00:28:45,028 --> 00:28:46,427
- Go ahead and say the answer. - Go ahead, Sang Uk.

842
00:28:46,428 --> 00:28:47,428
(What will be the answer?)
What's the answer?

843
00:28:48,429 --> 00:28:51,158
Someone with the skin...

844
00:28:51,728 --> 00:28:53,998
that's supple.

845
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:56,167
- He's narrating again. - And white.

846
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:58,437
- You can only say one thing. - Milky white.

847
00:28:58,438 --> 00:28:59,767
- Of course. - Skin that's milky white.

848
00:28:59,768 --> 00:29:00,837
Can I continue?

849
00:29:00,838 --> 00:29:03,407
- Someone who's white and milky. - Someone who's white...

850
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,478
Someone like that.

851
00:29:05,048 --> 00:29:06,107
(Someone like that?)

852
00:29:06,108 --> 00:29:07,108
You can't say that.

853
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:08,518
"Someone like that" can't be an answer.

854
00:29:08,718 --> 00:29:11,147
Someone who's white and something like that?

855
00:29:11,148 --> 00:29:12,947
- No, someone who's milky white. - He is...

856
00:29:12,948 --> 00:29:14,087
- milky white. - Milky white.

857
00:29:14,088 --> 00:29:16,518
His skin is supple from time to time.

858
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:19,028
- Someone with fair skin. - Someone with fair skin?

859
00:29:21,028 --> 00:29:22,127
"Bountiful tofu" means...

860
00:29:22,128 --> 00:29:24,558
- This is difficult. - someone with fair skin.

861
00:29:25,106 --> 00:29:27,206
- Someone with fair skin. - Someone with fair skin?

862
00:29:29,316 --> 00:29:30,345
"Bountiful tofu" means...

863
00:29:30,346 --> 00:29:32,786
- This is difficult. - someone with fair skin.

864
00:29:33,546 --> 00:29:35,185
(Answer: Someone with fair skin)

865
00:29:35,186 --> 00:29:36,186
Incorrect.

866
00:29:37,516 --> 00:29:38,756
(Smiling)

867
00:29:38,856 --> 00:29:40,255
- It's an individual game now. - Shall I guess?

868
00:29:40,256 --> 00:29:41,426
Their team will be destroyed.

869
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,356
(It's an individual game now.)

870
00:29:43,556 --> 00:29:45,525
(Team Tofu starts the individual game.)

871
00:29:45,526 --> 00:29:46,626
Our previous answer was...

872
00:29:47,126 --> 00:29:48,225
someone with fair skin.

873
00:29:48,226 --> 00:29:49,336
- Go ahead first. - I got it.

874
00:29:49,866 --> 00:29:52,306
- Sang Uk? - Someone with supple skin.

875
00:29:52,566 --> 00:29:54,566
- Someone with supple skin? - With elasticity.

876
00:29:54,866 --> 00:29:57,305
(Answer: Someone with supple and elastic skin)

877
00:29:57,306 --> 00:29:58,876
- Is it correct? - Incorrect.

878
00:29:59,876 --> 00:30:01,345
Then...

879
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:02,676
- someone who's fat. - Correct.

880
00:30:02,816 --> 00:30:04,615
(Tae Hyun escapes first.)

881
00:30:04,616 --> 00:30:06,285
- It's not what we thought. - We were right.

882
00:30:06,286 --> 00:30:07,315
Someone who's fat.

883
00:30:07,316 --> 00:30:08,655
- Seriously? - I knew it already.

884
00:30:08,656 --> 00:30:09,855
(He got it right, but he feels bitter for some reason.)

885
00:30:09,856 --> 00:30:11,185
This is what happened.

886
00:30:11,186 --> 00:30:12,525
Fat is correct.

887
00:30:12,526 --> 00:30:14,256
- It was one of our choices. - We talked about it.

888
00:30:14,886 --> 00:30:16,525
It's 80 dollars, so it's simple.

889
00:30:16,526 --> 00:30:17,726
It's only 80 dollars.

890
00:30:18,496 --> 00:30:19,765
- Here's the question. - Okay.

891
00:30:19,766 --> 00:30:21,226
(The final Who'll Pay, Seung Ho versus Sang Uk)

892
00:30:21,526 --> 00:30:24,736
In Korea, there's a tofu-like face shape.

893
00:30:24,766 --> 00:30:25,935
- "Tofu-like face shape?" - Yes.

894
00:30:25,936 --> 00:30:27,106
Is it a face that's round?

895
00:30:27,306 --> 00:30:29,635
We say that someone has a tofu-like face shape.

896
00:30:29,636 --> 00:30:30,675
"Tofu-like face shape."

897
00:30:30,676 --> 00:30:34,846
Similarly in Japan, a seasoning is used as a metaphor...

898
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:37,976
to describe a man's facial features or charms.

899
00:30:38,616 --> 00:30:40,315
Salt-like face shape means...

900
00:30:40,316 --> 00:30:42,216
someone with fair skin and simple features.

901
00:30:43,586 --> 00:30:47,425
Then how do they describe a typical handsome look...

902
00:30:47,426 --> 00:30:48,996
with strong facial features?

903
00:30:49,326 --> 00:30:51,396
- I got it. - Could it be...

904
00:30:52,126 --> 00:30:53,966
- Soy sauce. - My answer overlapped with yours.

905
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:55,666
- Soy sauce? - He's correct.

906
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,636
Due to strong features? Really?

907
00:30:58,166 --> 00:30:59,166
Correct.

908
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:00,736
(Oh Sang Uk is correct.)

909
00:31:00,906 --> 00:31:01,906
We overlapped.

910
00:31:01,907 --> 00:31:03,076
Soy sauce, right?

911
00:31:04,036 --> 00:31:05,476
Soy sauce because it's strong?

912
00:31:05,576 --> 00:31:06,576
Thank you for the food.

913
00:31:06,577 --> 00:31:07,775
In Japan, a lot of food is...

914
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,015
- made with soy sauce. - Right.

915
00:31:09,016 --> 00:31:10,475
I was thinking of soy sauce from the start.

916
00:31:10,476 --> 00:31:12,116
- In Japan, soy sauce-like face... - Soy sauce.

917
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:13,946
That's right.

918
00:31:14,546 --> 00:31:15,786
Does Dex have the soy sauce-like face?

919
00:31:15,986 --> 00:31:17,315
Dex has the soy sauce-like face.

920
00:31:17,316 --> 00:31:18,316
What about me?

921
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,626
What type of seasoning would describe me?

922
00:31:20,886 --> 00:31:22,856
- How about kelp? - I'd say...

923
00:31:23,896 --> 00:31:25,165
Kelp?

924
00:31:25,166 --> 00:31:26,926
Kelp is very important in cooking.

925
00:31:27,296 --> 00:31:28,596
- Kelp. - Kelp?

926
00:31:28,736 --> 00:31:29,936
Kelp sounds good.

927
00:31:30,466 --> 00:31:31,466
How about dried bonito flakes?

928
00:31:31,467 --> 00:31:32,566
Or tot.

929
00:31:32,736 --> 00:31:33,836
Dried bonito flakes?

930
00:31:34,806 --> 00:31:36,506
That's good.

931
00:31:37,076 --> 00:31:38,545
- The tofu was delicious. - Next time...

932
00:31:38,546 --> 00:31:39,905
- Thank you, Seung Ho. - Let's get duck stew now.

933
00:31:39,906 --> 00:31:41,105
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

934
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:42,276
Let's get duck stew next.

935
00:31:42,546 --> 00:31:43,775
Let's go to the duck stew restaurant.

936
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:44,876
Please.

937
00:31:45,446 --> 00:31:46,686
I don't need the receipt.

938
00:31:47,146 --> 00:31:49,315
- Thank you. - Thank you.

939
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:50,516
(Total: 80 dollars)

940
00:31:51,686 --> 00:31:56,496
(Handsome Guys come down to the second LMR restaurant.)

941
00:31:58,396 --> 00:31:59,396
I'm starving.

942
00:31:59,666 --> 00:32:01,725
- Seriously... - It's duck stew.

943
00:32:01,726 --> 00:32:03,166
- It's right in front of us. - Here we are.

944
00:32:03,966 --> 00:32:05,965
This is the restaurant where I had duck stew...

945
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:07,105
- in Jeolla Province. - Really?

946
00:32:07,106 --> 00:32:08,335
- This is the restaurant. - This one?

947
00:32:08,336 --> 00:32:09,435
- Over there? - This is amazing.

948
00:32:09,436 --> 00:32:11,636
I bet we'll all forget about the tofu.

949
00:32:11,806 --> 00:32:13,206
Look at the signboard.

950
00:32:14,046 --> 00:32:15,115
Oh, my.

951
00:32:15,116 --> 00:32:17,516
(A wait is expected even in the middle of the day.)

952
00:32:18,486 --> 00:32:20,446
(One side of the wall is filled with stars' autographs.)

953
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,116
(A lively crowd of customers are packed inside the restaurant.)

954
00:32:24,956 --> 00:32:26,155
(Gunja Duck Stew, Gwangju Duck Stew)

955
00:32:26,156 --> 00:32:28,226
I looked up a lot of information on it.

956
00:32:28,456 --> 00:32:30,256
When I tried it, I found it savory and delicious.

957
00:32:31,126 --> 00:32:32,365
I always liked duck stew.

958
00:32:32,366 --> 00:32:33,596
The duck stew is exceptionally tasty.

959
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:36,735
It has perilla seed powder,

960
00:32:36,736 --> 00:32:39,166
so it's very rich and flavorful.

961
00:32:40,266 --> 00:32:41,766
I love this sauce.

962
00:32:42,136 --> 00:32:44,505
This sauce is very addicting.

963
00:32:44,506 --> 00:32:46,005
(The very addicting sauce you dip...)

964
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:47,445
(with water parsley is the kick.)

965
00:32:47,446 --> 00:32:48,615
He enjoys it a lot.

966
00:32:48,616 --> 00:32:50,245
He finished the sauce because it was delicious.

967
00:32:50,246 --> 00:32:51,516
(Both the adults and children recognize the taste.)

968
00:32:51,716 --> 00:32:55,986
(From the original restaurant in Gwangju)

969
00:32:56,456 --> 00:32:59,686
(The same taste that both Tae Hyun and Yoon Ho raved about)

970
00:33:01,156 --> 00:33:05,866
(LMR 2, duck stew)

971
00:33:06,166 --> 00:33:08,166
This is what I remember.

972
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:09,965
It looked extraordinary.

973
00:33:09,966 --> 00:33:10,995
- Really? - Is that so?

974
00:33:10,996 --> 00:33:12,235
How was it?

975
00:33:12,236 --> 00:33:15,006
You know when the broth is thick and rich?

976
00:33:15,506 --> 00:33:17,205
- Like ox bone broth. - Is it thick...

977
00:33:17,206 --> 00:33:18,475
- like chueotang? - Yes.

978
00:33:18,476 --> 00:33:19,476
- Yes, chueotang. - On the other hand,

979
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:22,216
it also has a lot of fresh water parsley.

980
00:33:22,346 --> 00:33:23,515
The fragrance?

981
00:33:23,516 --> 00:33:25,616
What I remember is that we asked...

982
00:33:26,086 --> 00:33:27,845
for the water parsley refill several times.

983
00:33:27,846 --> 00:33:29,115
You did?

984
00:33:29,116 --> 00:33:30,185
The water parsley is...

985
00:33:30,186 --> 00:33:32,585
From the menu, you can order extra water parsley.

986
00:33:32,586 --> 00:33:33,586
Right.

987
00:33:33,587 --> 00:33:35,225
- We asked for a lot of refills. - It's water parsley.

988
00:33:35,226 --> 00:33:37,095
(Extra water parsley: 3 dollars)

989
00:33:37,096 --> 00:33:39,726
There are more on the menu other than duck stew.

990
00:33:39,966 --> 00:33:41,526
Grilled duck, marinated grilled duck.

991
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:43,336
We have to get the duck stew here.

992
00:33:43,636 --> 00:33:45,335
Aren't you going to order grilled duck?

993
00:33:45,336 --> 00:33:46,565
(I want some.)

994
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,506
- By the way... - You said you'd control yourself.

995
00:33:49,036 --> 00:33:50,105
A moment ago...

996
00:33:50,106 --> 00:33:51,876
Before coming into the restaurant, you said,

997
00:33:52,146 --> 00:33:53,506
- "I won't have any." - My mouth is watering.

998
00:33:53,876 --> 00:33:55,516
- Your mouth is watering? - Yes.

999
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:58,115
- While talking about water parsley, - Okay.

1000
00:33:58,116 --> 00:33:59,516
I spat a little.

1001
00:33:59,886 --> 00:34:02,115
- Hello. - Hello.

1002
00:34:02,116 --> 00:34:03,815
I tried your duck stew...

1003
00:34:03,816 --> 00:34:05,555
in Gwangju.

1004
00:34:05,556 --> 00:34:07,985
My eldest aunt ran our restaurant in Gwangju.

1005
00:34:07,986 --> 00:34:09,626
It's been around for 65 years.

1006
00:34:10,196 --> 00:34:12,995
We've been running this restaurant in Seoul...

1007
00:34:12,996 --> 00:34:14,925
- for 21 years. - It's been 21 years?

1008
00:34:14,926 --> 00:34:15,995
I had no idea.

1009
00:34:15,996 --> 00:34:17,596
Which one is better? The restaurant in Gwangju or Seoul?

1010
00:34:18,396 --> 00:34:20,506
Our customers say that it's more delicious here.

1011
00:34:21,236 --> 00:34:23,475
- We came to the right place. - Okay.

1012
00:34:23,476 --> 00:34:24,536
That's right.

1013
00:34:24,676 --> 00:34:26,805
The three of us will be eating the duck stew.

1014
00:34:26,806 --> 00:34:28,815
I'm sorry, but only the three of us will eat.

1015
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,616
We will order at least one duck.

1016
00:34:30,776 --> 00:34:32,215
- What else should we order? - Can we get half grilled...

1017
00:34:32,216 --> 00:34:33,415
and half marinated?

1018
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:35,215
You can order half and half.

1019
00:34:35,216 --> 00:34:36,616
I'm sure you eat well.

1020
00:34:36,956 --> 00:34:38,356
Let's grill the duck at their table.

1021
00:34:39,086 --> 00:34:41,126
That will be harder for us.

1022
00:34:41,726 --> 00:34:43,526
That's the point.

1023
00:34:43,856 --> 00:34:45,565
We'll put the stew here.

1024
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:46,895
We'll grill the duck at that table.

1025
00:34:46,896 --> 00:34:48,396
- I'll grill and serve you. - After that...

1026
00:34:48,596 --> 00:34:49,665
That will be our order.

1027
00:34:49,666 --> 00:34:51,865
- We'll also get raspberry wine. - Okay.

1028
00:34:51,866 --> 00:34:53,336
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1029
00:34:53,866 --> 00:34:55,936
- This place is... - Are you good at grilling meat?

1030
00:34:56,436 --> 00:34:57,575
Why don't we do this?

1031
00:34:57,576 --> 00:35:00,175
I don't know what drill instructors do...

1032
00:35:00,176 --> 00:35:01,876
during the UDT training.

1033
00:35:02,076 --> 00:35:03,676
- Dex, sit here and do what they do. - Okay.

1034
00:35:04,146 --> 00:35:05,146
Dex, show me what they do.

1035
00:35:05,147 --> 00:35:06,285
- I've wanted to see it. - Okay.

1036
00:35:06,286 --> 00:35:07,615
- I've wanted to see it. - Right.

1037
00:35:07,616 --> 00:35:09,085
What the drill instructors do while grilling the meat.

1038
00:35:09,086 --> 00:35:12,155
Is there a fan? I have to make the wind blow that way.

1039
00:35:12,156 --> 00:35:13,326
I see.

1040
00:35:13,886 --> 00:35:15,755
After how many days of not eating...

1041
00:35:15,756 --> 00:35:17,155
do they make you smell pork belly?

1042
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,965
It's when it's the most painful.

1043
00:35:18,966 --> 00:35:20,826
On the 3rd or 4th day.

1044
00:35:21,626 --> 00:35:23,835
On the 3rd or 4th day of starving,

1045
00:35:23,836 --> 00:35:26,406
do they give you a bite if you answer the quiz?

1046
00:35:27,006 --> 00:35:28,365
The drill instructors test you.

1047
00:35:28,366 --> 00:35:31,105
"If one person raises his hand, I'll give you pork belly."

1048
00:35:31,106 --> 00:35:32,176
I see.

1049
00:35:32,306 --> 00:35:33,445
Does someone raise his hand?

1050
00:35:33,446 --> 00:35:34,575
(If you raise your hand during the test)

1051
00:35:34,576 --> 00:35:36,175
Then you're disqualified from the group.

1052
00:35:36,176 --> 00:35:38,476
- All of us would raise our hand. - People here...

1053
00:35:38,616 --> 00:35:39,746
We would all raise our hand.

1054
00:35:40,046 --> 00:35:41,046
Tae Hyun.

1055
00:35:41,316 --> 00:35:42,655
"I'll eat and be disqualified."

1056
00:35:42,656 --> 00:35:43,785
Doesn't anyone do that?

1057
00:35:43,786 --> 00:35:45,485
Such people were already eliminated during the document screening.

1058
00:35:45,486 --> 00:35:46,956
They can't even come to the training.

1059
00:35:47,256 --> 00:35:48,795
Tae Hyun, they can't come to the training.

1060
00:35:48,796 --> 00:35:50,426
- He's exactly right. - I see.

1061
00:35:50,596 --> 00:35:52,065
I can tell that he was in the Marines.

1062
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,125
The training camp...

1063
00:35:53,126 --> 00:35:54,226
I can read it on your face.

1064
00:35:55,226 --> 00:35:56,335
(Setting the table finally starts.)

1065
00:35:56,336 --> 00:35:58,096
This is for the duck.

1066
00:35:59,006 --> 00:36:00,805
- This is for the duck. - This is it.

1067
00:36:00,806 --> 00:36:02,476
- This is it. - This is it.

1068
00:36:03,036 --> 00:36:04,105
Yes.

1069
00:36:04,106 --> 00:36:05,345
These perilla seeds are the best.

1070
00:36:05,346 --> 00:36:08,046
They're full-bodied.

1071
00:36:08,716 --> 00:36:12,446
(And water parsley that's served next to it)

1072
00:36:12,646 --> 00:36:14,846
It's best to lightly blanch the water parsley...

1073
00:36:15,116 --> 00:36:16,315
- before eating. - Lightly?

1074
00:36:16,316 --> 00:36:18,356
If it's blanched for a long time, it becomes tough.

1075
00:36:18,486 --> 00:36:21,586
Please blanch it lightly, and mix the sauce.

1076
00:36:21,926 --> 00:36:23,355
Dip the water parsley and meat in it.

1077
00:36:23,356 --> 00:36:24,456
Thank you.

1078
00:36:25,596 --> 00:36:26,725
(Side dishes and water parsley are served.)

1079
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,995
I'll grill it.

1080
00:36:27,996 --> 00:36:29,495
(Duck for grilling arrives.)

1081
00:36:29,496 --> 00:36:30,536
Gosh.

1082
00:36:31,036 --> 00:36:32,335
- The duck... - Look at its color.

1083
00:36:32,336 --> 00:36:34,506
Yes, it's smooth and shiny.

1084
00:36:35,166 --> 00:36:36,506
I've never seen duck for grilling.

1085
00:36:36,806 --> 00:36:38,976
- Now that I look at it... - It looks delicious.

1086
00:36:39,346 --> 00:36:41,245
- Shall I put it on the grill? - Yes.

1087
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:42,515
- Please do. - I'll start.

1088
00:36:42,516 --> 00:36:43,776
You can serve it here.

1089
00:36:45,316 --> 00:36:46,785
(The sound of grilling duck passes the test.)

1090
00:36:46,786 --> 00:36:48,386
- Goodness. - It sounds nice.

1091
00:36:49,856 --> 00:36:51,515
(Gently)

1092
00:36:51,516 --> 00:36:52,985
No, grill everything all at once.

1093
00:36:52,986 --> 00:36:54,386
- All at once? - You must grill all at once.

1094
00:36:55,326 --> 00:36:57,426
(I should listen to the meat eater.)

1095
00:36:58,396 --> 00:36:59,696
You should put that on the grill.

1096
00:37:00,626 --> 00:37:01,765
- This? - No.

1097
00:37:01,766 --> 00:37:03,136
The remaining part. Right.

1098
00:37:03,236 --> 00:37:04,435
There's some onion underneath.

1099
00:37:04,436 --> 00:37:05,906
(The other team takes the grilling out seriously.)

1100
00:37:06,366 --> 00:37:08,066
(He's grilling it well.)

1101
00:37:08,776 --> 00:37:09,905
She brought it in an earthen pot.

1102
00:37:09,906 --> 00:37:10,906
(The duck stew arrives.)

1103
00:37:11,306 --> 00:37:13,476
Gosh, what's this? It looks similar to curry.

1104
00:37:14,046 --> 00:37:15,106
Look at the leg.

1105
00:37:16,516 --> 00:37:17,645
Gosh, what's this?

1106
00:37:17,646 --> 00:37:19,916
(This restaurant's duck stew is...)

1107
00:37:20,246 --> 00:37:21,785
(A large-sized duck is placed inside an earthen pot.)

1108
00:37:21,786 --> 00:37:28,226
(A secret broth made with seasonings and perilla seed powder)

1109
00:37:29,456 --> 00:37:31,325
(When boiled, )

1110
00:37:31,326 --> 00:37:33,266
(it turns into a rich and flavorful duck stew.)

1111
00:37:35,026 --> 00:37:38,806
(A lot of water parsley on top)

1112
00:37:41,536 --> 00:37:42,805
Water parsley was served,

1113
00:37:42,806 --> 00:37:44,235
- but she served more. - It comes with the dish.

1114
00:37:44,236 --> 00:37:46,505
- Can we eat it right away? - Sure. Everything has been cooked.

1115
00:37:46,506 --> 00:37:48,106
- Can we eat? - Yes, you may eat.

1116
00:37:48,646 --> 00:37:51,646
It's not the broth I was expecting.

1117
00:37:52,346 --> 00:37:54,045
How do I put it? It's really thick.

1118
00:37:54,046 --> 00:37:55,915
(The thick broth of the duck stew)

1119
00:37:55,916 --> 00:37:59,456
This broth is insane. Do you see how thick it is?

1120
00:38:00,456 --> 00:38:03,026
(Thick)

1121
00:38:03,956 --> 00:38:06,166
It feels a bit like fish porridge.

1122
00:38:07,626 --> 00:38:09,565
- Check out the leg. - You should have that.

1123
00:38:09,566 --> 00:38:11,436
This is a duck that did squats.

1124
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:12,566
Look at how plump it is.

1125
00:38:14,306 --> 00:38:15,366
Thank you.

1126
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:18,506
- Here you go. - It's always like this.

1127
00:38:18,676 --> 00:38:21,076
- Let's enjoy our shots. - Bring it in.

1128
00:38:21,676 --> 00:38:23,476
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

1129
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:28,086
No way.

1130
00:38:28,486 --> 00:38:30,516
It's not like him to empty his glass.

1131
00:38:30,856 --> 00:38:32,185
(It's not like him.)

1132
00:38:32,186 --> 00:38:33,455
That's unexpected.

1133
00:38:33,456 --> 00:38:34,886
- Let's try the soup first. - The broth?

1134
00:38:35,386 --> 00:38:37,526
(Yi Kyung quickly tries the soup first.)

1135
00:38:38,296 --> 00:38:39,366
(My gosh!)

1136
00:38:39,796 --> 00:38:41,666
- I can't wait. - Is it supposed to taste like this?

1137
00:38:42,066 --> 00:38:43,436
The aroma...

1138
00:38:43,596 --> 00:38:46,966
of perilla seeds, duck meat, and water parsley goes up your nose.

1139
00:38:47,436 --> 00:38:48,936
(He has more right away.)

1140
00:38:49,106 --> 00:38:50,275
Yes, exactly.

1141
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:51,936
(Dex has his first bite of the duck stew.)

1142
00:38:52,276 --> 00:38:54,446
(What am I tasting?)

1143
00:38:54,706 --> 00:38:56,445
(Checking the aroma first)

1144
00:38:56,446 --> 00:38:57,446
(Yummy)
(My gosh!)

1145
00:38:59,916 --> 00:39:01,486
This is a better version of the biji stew.

1146
00:39:01,986 --> 00:39:04,086
- The nuttiness is insane. - I know.

1147
00:39:04,686 --> 00:39:06,686
It's like having rose pasta.

1148
00:39:06,856 --> 00:39:08,186
The sauce is amazing.

1149
00:39:10,626 --> 00:39:11,626
Wait...

1150
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,195
(Fantastic, What on earth is this?)

1151
00:39:17,196 --> 00:39:19,165
- The soup. - Can we get more broth?

1152
00:39:19,166 --> 00:39:21,506
- Now I'm curious. - It's...

1153
00:39:22,476 --> 00:39:24,405
Some people might not like it...

1154
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:26,245
- if the soup isn't smooth. - That isn't the case.

1155
00:39:26,246 --> 00:39:28,406
It's smooth even though it's thick.

1156
00:39:28,746 --> 00:39:30,116
(Staring)

1157
00:39:30,216 --> 00:39:32,076
- What is it like? I'm curious. - That's how it feels.

1158
00:39:33,546 --> 00:39:37,016
(In the meantime, water parsley has softened.)

1159
00:39:37,156 --> 00:39:40,286
She told us to eat the water parsley.

1160
00:39:40,886 --> 00:39:42,255
Mix this first.

1161
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:45,966
(First, mixing the perilla seed powder sauce)

1162
00:39:46,596 --> 00:39:47,596
(It's time to pay attention.)

1163
00:39:47,597 --> 00:39:49,866
Take some of the meat and the water parsley.

1164
00:39:49,996 --> 00:39:52,195
- Dunk that in there. - Right.

1165
00:39:52,196 --> 00:39:53,805
- Right. - And then...

1166
00:39:53,806 --> 00:39:55,835
(A mouthful)

1167
00:39:55,836 --> 00:39:57,236
The flavors aren't strong.

1168
00:39:57,606 --> 00:40:01,476
(Dong Hyun has a huge mouthful of it too.)

1169
00:40:07,486 --> 00:40:11,556
(Obsessed with water parsley)

1170
00:40:11,886 --> 00:40:13,126
The sauce is insane.

1171
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:16,195
The sauce...

1172
00:40:16,196 --> 00:40:17,595
(That's what I'm talking about.)

1173
00:40:17,596 --> 00:40:18,856
It's sweet and nutty.

1174
00:40:20,296 --> 00:40:21,365
- Yes, sweet and nutty. - Right.

1175
00:40:21,366 --> 00:40:22,366
(My gosh!)

1176
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:25,706
The water parsley is insane.

1177
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:27,606
Also, by the looks of it,

1178
00:40:28,366 --> 00:40:30,075
if ducks also come in different sizes,

1179
00:40:30,076 --> 00:40:32,845
this would be a 13. That's how big it is.

1180
00:40:32,846 --> 00:40:33,876
Yes, it's big.

1181
00:40:35,276 --> 00:40:37,116
(Who could refuse the leg of a big duck?)

1182
00:40:37,346 --> 00:40:38,476
Help yourself to as much sauce as you like.

1183
00:40:38,846 --> 00:40:42,386
(Inhaling the duck covered in perilla seed powder sauce)

1184
00:40:42,956 --> 00:40:44,186
(One more)

1185
00:40:46,326 --> 00:40:48,586
(Yummy)

1186
00:40:49,156 --> 00:40:51,426
(Jealous)

1187
00:40:51,926 --> 00:40:54,726
- Sang Uk must be curious. - I am.

1188
00:40:55,066 --> 00:40:57,835
- Give Sang Uk a question already. - Sang Uk...

1189
00:40:57,836 --> 00:40:58,896
It hasn't been cooked yet.

1190
00:40:59,436 --> 00:41:01,235
- It needs to cook more. - That's right.

1191
00:41:01,236 --> 00:41:02,236
This...

1192
00:41:04,036 --> 00:41:05,945
Aren't you going to drink while enjoying the duck?

1193
00:41:05,946 --> 00:41:07,605
- We should. - Yes, let's drink to be healthy.

1194
00:41:07,606 --> 00:41:08,946
We'll say "health" three times.

1195
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,215
- Health, health, health. - Health, health, health.

1196
00:41:11,216 --> 00:41:13,145
(Over-consumption of alcohol is bad for your health.)

1197
00:41:13,146 --> 00:41:15,045
Dong Hyun's drinking a lot today.

1198
00:41:15,046 --> 00:41:16,216
I'm having a few sips at a time.

1199
00:41:18,156 --> 00:41:21,025
He'll fall asleep in the middle of the show at this rate.

1200
00:41:21,026 --> 00:41:23,726
(They're like old men who are back from a hiking trip.)

1201
00:41:24,296 --> 00:41:26,295
(In the meantime, )

1202
00:41:26,296 --> 00:41:28,296
(the meat on the griddle is being cooked.)

1203
00:41:29,796 --> 00:41:32,566
(Pay attention.)

1204
00:41:33,706 --> 00:41:35,165
(It's hot.)

1205
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,176
(Glancing)

1206
00:41:36,506 --> 00:41:37,705
How did it get in your mouth?

1207
00:41:37,706 --> 00:41:38,836
Hold on.

1208
00:41:39,376 --> 00:41:42,575
Is the meat shrinking, or is there now less meat on there?

1209
00:41:42,576 --> 00:41:44,276
(It feels like there's less meat on the griddle.)

1210
00:41:44,416 --> 00:41:46,485
- Haven't you had any? - We haven't.

1211
00:41:46,486 --> 00:41:47,516
Why are there fewer pieces of meat?

1212
00:41:47,946 --> 00:41:49,286
Could they have eaten that?

1213
00:41:49,656 --> 00:41:51,255
- Hey. - You seem to be a bit tipsy.

1214
00:41:51,256 --> 00:41:53,285
- Why are you suspicious of us? - But...

1215
00:41:53,286 --> 00:41:55,225
- Should I call you a driver? - The griddle was covered with meat,

1216
00:41:55,226 --> 00:41:56,696
but now there's room to grill more.

1217
00:41:57,156 --> 00:41:59,496
(I feel like I saw something.)

1218
00:42:00,266 --> 00:42:03,135
- Can you serve that over here? - Here you go.

1219
00:42:03,136 --> 00:42:04,396
(Serve them the meat before they figure it out.)

1220
00:42:05,736 --> 00:42:06,966
Do we dip this in the sauce too?

1221
00:42:07,336 --> 00:42:09,676
(Dip it in any sauce you want.)

1222
00:42:10,176 --> 00:42:12,706
(Dong Hyun dips it in the traditional oil sauce.)

1223
00:42:12,946 --> 00:42:14,146
(A piece of grilled duck)

1224
00:42:14,346 --> 00:42:15,606
(My gosh...)

1225
00:42:16,246 --> 00:42:17,516
I like how light the duck meat is.

1226
00:42:19,016 --> 00:42:21,146
(Dex enjoys the grilled duck with perilla seed powder sauce.)

1227
00:42:21,686 --> 00:42:23,185
(The shaking of the chopsticks show how good it is.)

1228
00:42:23,186 --> 00:42:24,255
Sorry about that.

1229
00:42:24,256 --> 00:42:25,516
(He goes for another one right away.)

1230
00:42:25,726 --> 00:42:28,085
Let's take this time to give them a quiz.

1231
00:42:28,086 --> 00:42:29,096
Sounds good.

1232
00:42:29,196 --> 00:42:30,196
- Time to freeload. - Sounds good.

1233
00:42:30,197 --> 00:42:31,856
- I love it. - Time to freeload.

1234
00:42:32,296 --> 00:42:34,195
Meat off bone, with water parsley,

1235
00:42:34,196 --> 00:42:35,296
- and dip in sauce. - The water parsley.

1236
00:42:35,596 --> 00:42:36,736
- That's right. - It's a big one.

1237
00:42:37,696 --> 00:42:38,735
You'll get to taste it.

1238
00:42:38,736 --> 00:42:39,806
(What game will they play this time?)

1239
00:42:39,906 --> 00:42:40,906
What will it be?

1240
00:42:40,907 --> 00:42:42,066
Add the numbers.

1241
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,075
This is tough. It isn't easy.

1242
00:42:45,076 --> 00:42:47,145
- The winner can eat. - Sure.

1243
00:42:47,146 --> 00:42:48,705
And go.

1244
00:42:48,706 --> 00:42:51,545
- Memorize your times tables. - Memorize your times tables.

1245
00:42:51,546 --> 00:42:53,315
- Nine and seven. - Sixteen.

1246
00:42:53,316 --> 00:42:55,915
- Memorize your times tables. - Memorize your times tables.

1247
00:42:55,916 --> 00:42:59,055
- Seven and six. - Fourteen.

1248
00:42:59,056 --> 00:43:00,956
- Fourteen. - Incorrect!

1249
00:43:03,096 --> 00:43:04,395
- You couldn't succeed in one round. - I know.

1250
00:43:04,396 --> 00:43:05,495
This is why the game ends early.

1251
00:43:05,496 --> 00:43:07,265
(Wait, it's 13.)

1252
00:43:07,266 --> 00:43:09,366
- Were you still adding the numbers? - Fourteen.

1253
00:43:09,896 --> 00:43:12,635
I wanted to eat this so badly.

1254
00:43:12,636 --> 00:43:14,066
I guess you can't eat it if you want it too much.

1255
00:43:16,536 --> 00:43:17,576
This is cruel.

1256
00:43:17,936 --> 00:43:19,145
Can I have some of the meat?

1257
00:43:19,146 --> 00:43:20,805
- The meat and... - And the water parsley.

1258
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:23,315
- The water parsley. - Have the water parsley.

1259
00:43:23,316 --> 00:43:25,446
- There's a lot over there. - The water parsley.

1260
00:43:25,886 --> 00:43:27,546
Here you go.

1261
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:28,685
(Big eater Seung Ho gets a huge amount.)

1262
00:43:28,686 --> 00:43:30,455
- Can I have more water parsley? - Take it.

1263
00:43:30,456 --> 00:43:31,515
You should have a lot of water parsley.

1264
00:43:31,516 --> 00:43:32,526
(Big eater Seung Ho gets a huge amount.)

1265
00:43:33,286 --> 00:43:37,656
(Sang Uk can't take his eyes off the duck stew.)

1266
00:43:37,956 --> 00:43:39,826
You can dip that in the sauce real good.

1267
00:43:40,726 --> 00:43:42,696
- Are you angry? - Of course not.

1268
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:46,936
(Like Sang Uk suggested, he dips it in the sauce again.)

1269
00:43:47,606 --> 00:43:49,375
That's the real deal.

1270
00:43:49,376 --> 00:43:51,176
(He enjoys a delicious mouthful as the freeloader.)

1271
00:43:53,606 --> 00:43:55,606
- That's the highlight of this meal. - Exactly.

1272
00:43:58,776 --> 00:44:00,945
The sound I'm hearing is just as incredible.

1273
00:44:00,946 --> 00:44:02,885
Even in your mouth,

1274
00:44:02,886 --> 00:44:04,515
the texture of every ingredient...

1275
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,286
lingers.

1276
00:44:06,586 --> 00:44:07,655
It lingers.

1277
00:44:07,656 --> 00:44:09,626
The flavors are nutty and rich.

1278
00:44:10,826 --> 00:44:12,496
I wouldn't mind paying for this meal.

1279
00:44:12,966 --> 00:44:14,296
I'm just really curious about how it tastes.

1280
00:44:14,366 --> 00:44:15,966
(Maybe I should just pay up and enjoy the meal too.)

1281
00:44:16,296 --> 00:44:17,965
(They're not interested.)

1282
00:44:17,966 --> 00:44:20,106
- Can we have more water parsley? - Water parsley.

1283
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:22,906
You can't stop having the water parsley.

1284
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:27,046
I could have it all day.

1285
00:44:27,376 --> 00:44:29,246
He's dozing off.

1286
00:44:29,946 --> 00:44:32,046
(Eyes widen.)

1287
00:44:32,076 --> 00:44:33,345
Look at him. He's dozing off.

1288
00:44:33,346 --> 00:44:35,146
Where's my duck meat?

1289
00:44:36,316 --> 00:44:38,486
You look like you're wearing special effects makeup.

1290
00:44:38,956 --> 00:44:40,556
It looks like you've dressed up for "Amazing Saturday."

1291
00:44:41,656 --> 00:44:42,656
Wait, this is bone.

1292
00:44:44,696 --> 00:44:47,196
I hope you didn't eat the bone you had set to the side.

1293
00:44:48,126 --> 00:44:50,235
He's been setting the bone to the side,

1294
00:44:50,236 --> 00:44:51,465
only to have it with the water parsley.

1295
00:44:51,466 --> 00:44:53,136
- What's his deal? - He does it all over again.

1296
00:44:53,406 --> 00:44:54,565
Keep an eye out for him.

1297
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:56,506
Yi Kyung and Dex, keep an eye out for him.

1298
00:44:56,806 --> 00:44:58,375
See if he's eating what he had set aside.

1299
00:44:58,376 --> 00:44:59,506
I only had one shot.

1300
00:44:59,576 --> 00:45:01,775
- He's sweating as well. - I know.

1301
00:45:01,776 --> 00:45:02,815
You have no idea.

1302
00:45:02,816 --> 00:45:03,915
- His t-shirt is wet. - How many times...

1303
00:45:03,916 --> 00:45:05,015
did you ask for more water parsley?

1304
00:45:05,016 --> 00:45:06,485
- I think... - I'd like some more.

1305
00:45:06,486 --> 00:45:08,815
- That's the alcohol talking. - I need more water parsley.

1306
00:45:08,816 --> 00:45:10,316
- Can we have more water parsley? - That's hot!

1307
00:45:12,056 --> 00:45:13,056
That's hot!

1308
00:45:13,057 --> 00:45:15,155
(A one-man show)

1309
00:45:15,156 --> 00:45:17,196
It's really hot. See for yourself.

1310
00:45:17,396 --> 00:45:19,465
- It's not that hot. - Grab it in the middle.

1311
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,995
- Grab it in the middle. - It's fine.

1312
00:45:20,996 --> 00:45:22,125
It's not that hot.

1313
00:45:22,126 --> 00:45:24,395
- Did it feel hot just to me? - It's not that hot.

1314
00:45:24,396 --> 00:45:25,565
- He... - Taxi!

1315
00:45:25,566 --> 00:45:27,906
- It's not that hot. - Taxi.

1316
00:45:29,036 --> 00:45:30,275
- Let's get him home. - Seriously.

1317
00:45:30,276 --> 00:45:31,935
- It's not that hot. - There's a cab.

1318
00:45:31,936 --> 00:45:34,445
- That really startled me. - It's not that hot.

1319
00:45:34,446 --> 00:45:35,475
It cooled down a bit.

1320
00:45:35,476 --> 00:45:38,145
(Watch your alcohol intake after hiking.)

1321
00:45:38,146 --> 00:45:40,846
If you don't get the question right, Dong Hyun will pay for sure.

1322
00:45:40,886 --> 00:45:42,616
He's fully intoxicated.

1323
00:45:42,956 --> 00:45:44,485
I doubt he'll even be able to hear the question.

1324
00:45:44,486 --> 00:45:47,255
Anyone who loses to a drunk has a serious problem.

1325
00:45:47,256 --> 00:45:48,756
I know I'll do better than you.

1326
00:45:51,196 --> 00:45:52,225
I can't lose to him.

1327
00:45:52,226 --> 00:45:53,425
How much is everything?

1328
00:45:53,426 --> 00:45:55,165
- Let's see the bill. - Here we go.

1329
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:56,565
(How much was the meal for Team Duck Stew?)

1330
00:45:56,566 --> 00:45:58,595
- The total is 164 dollars. - It's 164 dollars.

1331
00:45:58,596 --> 00:46:00,335
- Gosh, that's pricey. - What?

1332
00:46:00,336 --> 00:46:01,435
That's a hefty bill.

1333
00:46:01,436 --> 00:46:02,735
- Exactly. - First...

1334
00:46:02,736 --> 00:46:04,235
- Let's get it right. - Sure.

1335
00:46:04,236 --> 00:46:05,635
- Let's get it right. - Cheers.

1336
00:46:05,636 --> 00:46:06,805
(Endure the weight of water parsley.)

1337
00:46:06,806 --> 00:46:09,005
- Let's do this. - Here's your question.

1338
00:46:09,006 --> 00:46:10,875
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

1339
00:46:10,876 --> 00:46:14,485
In many cases, ducks die after walking into narrow tunnels...

1340
00:46:14,486 --> 00:46:15,915
or places with wire netting...

1341
00:46:15,916 --> 00:46:18,656
- because they can't walk back out. - Narrow tunnels?

1342
00:46:18,986 --> 00:46:22,126
That's because ducks are a certain way.

1343
00:46:22,826 --> 00:46:24,026
What's the reason?

1344
00:46:24,726 --> 00:46:26,725
- I think I know what this is. - Places with wire netting or...

1345
00:46:26,726 --> 00:46:28,325
- Do you know what it is? - I do.

1346
00:46:28,326 --> 00:46:29,836
- You go first. - Sure. I know why.

1347
00:46:30,466 --> 00:46:32,466
Because of their webbed feet. Is that not it?

1348
00:46:33,206 --> 00:46:36,136
You know how hard it is to walk with swim fins.

1349
00:46:37,176 --> 00:46:38,775
Let me see. What's the answer?

1350
00:46:38,776 --> 00:46:40,976
(Team Tofu share the answer they guessed.)

1351
00:46:42,006 --> 00:46:43,116
Exactly.

1352
00:46:43,546 --> 00:46:46,586
Isn't it because ducks can't walk backward?

1353
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:47,916
Why is that?

1354
00:46:48,216 --> 00:46:50,215
Because of their feet, they can walk forward,

1355
00:46:50,216 --> 00:46:51,516
but not backward.

1356
00:46:51,686 --> 00:46:53,456
- Isn't it that? - Ducks can't walk backward.

1357
00:46:53,556 --> 00:46:54,885
How ducks are.

1358
00:46:54,886 --> 00:46:57,495
- We're wrong. - I don't think that's right.

1359
00:46:57,496 --> 00:46:58,955
It's not because ducks can't walk backward.

1360
00:46:58,956 --> 00:47:00,126
They can't though.

1361
00:47:00,266 --> 00:47:01,626
They must be able to walk backward.

1362
00:47:02,026 --> 00:47:03,565
Then it's the feet.

1363
00:47:03,566 --> 00:47:04,766
- The webbed feet. - That's the one.

1364
00:47:05,296 --> 00:47:07,766
Ducks walk like this.

1365
00:47:08,206 --> 00:47:10,476
But not in a straight line. They waddle.

1366
00:47:10,636 --> 00:47:12,576
The legs make circular motions.

1367
00:47:12,706 --> 00:47:15,475
So even if they make in inside, they can't come back out.

1368
00:47:15,476 --> 00:47:17,215
- Let's give that a try. - Okay. Let's answer it.

1369
00:47:17,216 --> 00:47:19,075
- If not, we'll play as individuals. - Sure.

1370
00:47:19,076 --> 00:47:21,445
- We have the advantage. - There's Dong Hyun.

1371
00:47:21,446 --> 00:47:23,015
Dong Hyun, did you know you had duck meat on your face?

1372
00:47:23,016 --> 00:47:25,355
Really? Okay, got it. What's this?

1373
00:47:25,356 --> 00:47:26,525
- Okay. - Right.

1374
00:47:26,526 --> 00:47:29,155
It's because of their webbed feet...

1375
00:47:29,156 --> 00:47:31,626
and the circular motions they have to make.

1376
00:47:33,326 --> 00:47:34,526
That is incorrect.

1377
00:47:35,066 --> 00:47:36,635
- My gosh. - You startled me.

1378
00:47:36,636 --> 00:47:37,766
- What's the correct answer? - What's the correct answer?

1379
00:47:37,996 --> 00:47:40,965
It's because ducks can't walk backward.

1380
00:47:40,966 --> 00:47:43,105
What I initially said was right.

1381
00:47:43,106 --> 00:47:44,406
Didn't you say that earlier? That they can't walk backward.

1382
00:47:44,476 --> 00:47:46,546
- That was what I said initially. - Yes.

1383
00:47:46,746 --> 00:47:48,005
(They got played.)

1384
00:47:48,006 --> 00:47:49,046
But...

1385
00:47:49,176 --> 00:47:50,475
(Good job.)

1386
00:47:50,476 --> 00:47:52,576
- You made them switch answers. - It was me.

1387
00:47:52,616 --> 00:47:54,685
Why did you listen to me?

1388
00:47:54,686 --> 00:47:56,216
(Why did you listen to me?)

1389
00:47:56,256 --> 00:47:57,655
- It was unclear. - Okay.

1390
00:47:57,656 --> 00:47:59,186
- Let's play the individual match. - Let's play it individually.

1391
00:47:59,256 --> 00:48:01,685
Okay. Water parsley is a vegetable...

1392
00:48:01,686 --> 00:48:04,756
that is a vital ingredient for stews, including duck stew.

1393
00:48:04,926 --> 00:48:06,495
In "New Unparalleled Recipes of Korean Cuisine,"

1394
00:48:06,496 --> 00:48:08,696
a cookbook from the Joseon Dynasty,

1395
00:48:08,766 --> 00:48:10,835
it says when cleaning water parsley,

1396
00:48:10,836 --> 00:48:14,106
a person who can see clearly should do it.

1397
00:48:14,366 --> 00:48:17,275
Also, it should be put in brassware to remove this.

1398
00:48:17,276 --> 00:48:18,936
- I got it. - That's what the book says.

1399
00:48:19,606 --> 00:48:20,846
- I got it. - I'm not done with the question.

1400
00:48:21,376 --> 00:48:22,645
- Go for it. - Dong Hyun.

1401
00:48:22,646 --> 00:48:23,746
Try it.

1402
00:48:24,476 --> 00:48:26,616
Well, on water parsley,

1403
00:48:26,646 --> 00:48:28,086
there are many leeches.

1404
00:48:28,346 --> 00:48:29,516
Remove leeches.

1405
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,716
- Leeches on water parsley. - Why?

1406
00:48:32,616 --> 00:48:33,725
It's correct.

1407
00:48:33,726 --> 00:48:35,825
(To remove leeches)

1408
00:48:35,826 --> 00:48:36,925
You're right.

1409
00:48:36,926 --> 00:48:38,126
(Amazed)

1410
00:48:38,356 --> 00:48:40,165
Did you know that? No?

1411
00:48:40,166 --> 00:48:42,096
- I thought it was toxicity. - He's something.

1412
00:48:42,496 --> 00:48:43,795
How did he know that?

1413
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:44,935
I pretended to be drunk.

1414
00:48:44,936 --> 00:48:46,036
- Drunken Fist! - Amazing.

1415
00:48:46,536 --> 00:48:47,736
He got me.

1416
00:48:47,866 --> 00:48:49,136
The Drunken Fist got me.

1417
00:48:49,736 --> 00:48:51,576
His face has turned white again.

1418
00:48:51,736 --> 00:48:53,375
It has come back.

1419
00:48:53,376 --> 00:48:54,506
Gosh. This guy.

1420
00:48:54,906 --> 00:48:56,276
It's a 1-on-1 match now.

1421
00:48:56,446 --> 00:48:58,245
- That was crazy. - I used the Drunken Fist.

1422
00:48:58,246 --> 00:48:59,745
- I got played. - It's unbelievable.

1423
00:48:59,746 --> 00:49:01,085
- Gosh. - Shall we begin...

1424
00:49:01,086 --> 00:49:02,385
the 1-on-1 match between Dex and Yi Kyung?

1425
00:49:02,386 --> 00:49:04,585
Will the guest pay for the meal?

1426
00:49:04,586 --> 00:49:05,885
Please.

1427
00:49:05,886 --> 00:49:07,725
I don't want Dex to pay for it.

1428
00:49:07,726 --> 00:49:10,725
(Will Dex be able to avoid paying for the meal?)

1429
00:49:10,726 --> 00:49:12,056
- Let's go. - Okay.

1430
00:49:13,366 --> 00:49:15,296
- It's fun. Yes. - It's a famous quote.

1431
00:49:15,926 --> 00:49:17,236
- That's easy. - A famous quote.

1432
00:49:17,996 --> 00:49:19,195
A famous quote? Gosh.

1433
00:49:19,196 --> 00:49:20,506
Doug Larson said...

1434
00:49:20,766 --> 00:49:22,606
- Mr. Doug Larson. - Mr. Doug Larson.

1435
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:24,376
I've never heard of him before.

1436
00:49:24,536 --> 00:49:27,045
"When you look someone in the eye..."

1437
00:49:27,046 --> 00:49:29,516
"and feel no urge to start a staring contest,"

1438
00:49:30,376 --> 00:49:32,176
"It proves that you're..."

1439
00:49:32,616 --> 00:49:33,746
A proof?

1440
00:49:34,586 --> 00:49:35,716
- I got it. - Okay.

1441
00:49:36,016 --> 00:49:37,055
Dex.

1442
00:49:37,056 --> 00:49:42,086
(Dex shouts out as soon as he hears the quiz.)

1443
00:49:42,686 --> 00:49:45,256
It proves that you're okay with others beating you.

1444
00:49:45,556 --> 00:49:47,396
- Incorrect. - That's too long for a quote.

1445
00:49:47,596 --> 00:49:49,296
- It must be short. - So, it means...

1446
00:49:49,496 --> 00:49:51,396
It proves that that person and I have no connection.

1447
00:49:52,466 --> 00:49:53,866
- Incorrect. - Okay.

1448
00:49:54,106 --> 00:49:55,566
- No urge to start... - I got it.

1449
00:49:56,936 --> 00:49:58,006
Dex.

1450
00:49:58,036 --> 00:50:00,546
It proves that you want to kiss that person.

1451
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:02,546
How romantic!

1452
00:50:02,676 --> 00:50:03,816
Incorrect.

1453
00:50:04,146 --> 00:50:06,685
- Gosh. That's your move. - You want to kiss her.

1454
00:50:06,686 --> 00:50:08,886
That's how he makes his move.

1455
00:50:09,516 --> 00:50:11,456
I got it. It proves that you love her.

1456
00:50:13,386 --> 00:50:14,526
Incorrect.

1457
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:16,226
I guess it's not even close.

1458
00:50:16,426 --> 00:50:18,055
Why would you avoid a staring contest?

1459
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,355
- Your eyes are sore. - Yes. Usually,

1460
00:50:19,356 --> 00:50:21,825
a staring contest is a match of one's energy.

1461
00:50:21,826 --> 00:50:22,895
But you want to avoid it.

1462
00:50:22,896 --> 00:50:23,965
- Like this. - Yes.

1463
00:50:23,966 --> 00:50:26,966
That means your heart is open to whoever the person is.

1464
00:50:27,066 --> 00:50:29,135
You have to choose between a heart-pumping romance...

1465
00:50:29,136 --> 00:50:30,275
and a fight.

1466
00:50:30,276 --> 00:50:31,635
Yes. We have to choose.

1467
00:50:31,636 --> 00:50:33,776
The both of them make sense, so you have to choose.

1468
00:50:34,876 --> 00:50:36,276
I have no idea.

1469
00:50:37,176 --> 00:50:39,245
Dex, you're walking on a street, and our eyes meet.

1470
00:50:39,246 --> 00:50:40,515
- Avoid my eye contact. - Okay.

1471
00:50:40,516 --> 00:50:41,785
(Avoiding eye contact)

1472
00:50:41,786 --> 00:50:45,616
- Like this? - What makes you avoid it?

1473
00:50:46,056 --> 00:50:47,156
Because you're ugly?

1474
00:50:47,386 --> 00:50:48,685
You.

1475
00:50:48,686 --> 00:50:51,296
Come on. I can't believe this.

1476
00:50:51,396 --> 00:50:53,466
I'm trying to help you here.

1477
00:50:54,666 --> 00:50:56,066
- No. - Goodness.

1478
00:50:56,126 --> 00:50:58,666
That soy sauce-faced man belittled Mr. Kelp.

1479
00:50:58,796 --> 00:51:00,265
- No. - Because Mr. Soy Sauce is handsome.

1480
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:01,735
He looked down on Mr. Kelp.

1481
00:51:01,736 --> 00:51:02,806
What is it?

1482
00:51:03,136 --> 00:51:06,076
It proves that I'm more good-looking than them.

1483
00:51:06,206 --> 00:51:08,905
When we were young, when someone looked at us,

1484
00:51:08,906 --> 00:51:10,075
we started a staring contest.

1485
00:51:10,076 --> 00:51:11,745
- But at some point in life, - You don't want to do it.

1486
00:51:11,746 --> 00:51:13,016
It feels like, "What's the point?"

1487
00:51:13,046 --> 00:51:14,885
- You're scared. - It proves that you're scared.

1488
00:51:14,886 --> 00:51:16,585
"That you're scared." Incorrect.

1489
00:51:16,586 --> 00:51:18,186
That you've turned into a herbivore.

1490
00:51:19,486 --> 00:51:20,855
- Incorrect. - You're on the right track.

1491
00:51:20,856 --> 00:51:22,325
When do you turn into a herbivore...

1492
00:51:22,326 --> 00:51:23,526
from a carnivore?

1493
00:51:23,926 --> 00:51:25,025
- I got it! - I got it.

1494
00:51:25,026 --> 00:51:26,096
(Dex was faster.)

1495
00:51:26,156 --> 00:51:27,195
- I got it! - It's close.

1496
00:51:27,196 --> 00:51:28,666
(It's close.)

1497
00:51:28,766 --> 00:51:32,196
That I've matured.

1498
00:51:32,636 --> 00:51:34,806
I got it. That I've grown old.

1499
00:51:35,236 --> 00:51:41,246
(Which one is closer to the answer?)

1500
00:51:41,546 --> 00:51:42,775
That I've grown old.

1501
00:51:42,776 --> 00:51:43,915
Correct.

1502
00:51:43,916 --> 00:51:45,376
(It proves that I've grown old.)

1503
00:51:46,016 --> 00:51:48,216
You're right. It means you're old.

1504
00:51:49,346 --> 00:51:51,116
I survived again today.

1505
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:52,815
That's a sad quote.

1506
00:51:52,816 --> 00:51:54,125
(Now that he heard the answer)

1507
00:51:54,126 --> 00:51:55,325
It was a sad quote.

1508
00:51:55,326 --> 00:51:57,755
- It's sad. - You've run out of energy.

1509
00:51:57,756 --> 00:51:59,156
It means you're old.

1510
00:52:00,266 --> 00:52:01,365
- Gosh. - I'll pay.

1511
00:52:01,366 --> 00:52:02,465
Do you admit your defeat?

1512
00:52:02,466 --> 00:52:03,795
Totally.

1513
00:52:03,796 --> 00:52:04,996
I had no idea.

1514
00:52:05,596 --> 00:52:06,735
Can I politely ask...

1515
00:52:06,736 --> 00:52:08,465
to eat with Dex for dinner?

1516
00:52:08,466 --> 00:52:10,035
(Can I be on Dex's team again for dinner too?)

1517
00:52:10,036 --> 00:52:12,205
Dong Hyun is good.

1518
00:52:12,206 --> 00:52:14,075
- He's good. - Can I eat with Dex?

1519
00:52:14,076 --> 00:52:15,775
Dong Hyun pretends to be weak, but he's good.

1520
00:52:15,776 --> 00:52:17,015
- He's good. - Let's go.

1521
00:52:17,016 --> 00:52:18,016
Yes. Let's be on the same team.

1522
00:52:18,017 --> 00:52:19,246
I admit that I lost.

1523
00:52:19,376 --> 00:52:20,786
- Dex, thanks for the food. - Yes.

1524
00:52:21,316 --> 00:52:23,985
Dex treated us with a healthy meal.

1525
00:52:23,986 --> 00:52:25,455
- Thank you. - I enjoyed the water parsley.

1526
00:52:25,456 --> 00:52:27,385
- Try it. - Seriously.

1527
00:52:27,386 --> 00:52:28,725
- I want to try it. - Try it.

1528
00:52:28,726 --> 00:52:29,926
I'll use my privilege for you.

1529
00:52:30,626 --> 00:52:31,995
- Nice. - Are you giving it to him?

1530
00:52:31,996 --> 00:52:33,096
Since I'm paying for it.

1531
00:52:33,166 --> 00:52:34,496
Here. Take this.

1532
00:52:34,796 --> 00:52:35,865
There's a piece of meat.

1533
00:52:35,866 --> 00:52:36,895
Do you want it with the meat?

1534
00:52:36,896 --> 00:52:38,895
- I'll take one in that case. - Okay.

1535
00:52:38,896 --> 00:52:41,205
- Take the warm piece. - Because it's a stew...

1536
00:52:41,206 --> 00:52:43,236
They take good care of the youngest one.

1537
00:52:48,346 --> 00:52:49,376
How is it?

1538
00:52:49,676 --> 00:52:51,446
- The sauce is crazy. - Right?

1539
00:52:52,116 --> 00:52:53,316
It's perfect.

1540
00:52:53,486 --> 00:52:55,685
- It's pleasantly sour. - The sauce has a tang.

1541
00:52:55,686 --> 00:52:57,356
Gosh. The water parsley tastes amazing.

1542
00:53:02,356 --> 00:53:03,555
- Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the food.

1543
00:53:03,556 --> 00:53:04,995
- Dex, thank you for the food. - Sure.

1544
00:53:04,996 --> 00:53:06,195
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1545
00:53:06,196 --> 00:53:07,396
Dex is the best.

1546
00:53:08,326 --> 00:53:13,306
(Total: 164 dollars)

1547
00:53:16,006 --> 00:53:17,935
(Lunch recommendations in Mount Acha and Gunja)

1548
00:53:17,936 --> 00:53:19,975
(Tofu: Chewy and flavorful, amazing ramyeon, best combo)

1549
00:53:19,976 --> 00:53:21,846
"(Duck stew: Best water parsley, Nice and thick, best combo)

1550
00:53:22,006 --> 00:53:25,616
(A few hours after recommending the lunch options, )

1551
00:53:27,246 --> 00:53:30,656
(it's time for dessert with a cup of coffee.)

1552
00:53:30,956 --> 00:53:32,115
If I were a woman,

1553
00:53:32,116 --> 00:53:33,425
I could fall in love with Dong Hyun.

1554
00:53:33,426 --> 00:53:34,725
- Seriously. - He's cool.

1555
00:53:34,726 --> 00:53:35,955
He could fall in love.

1556
00:53:35,956 --> 00:53:37,526
(Laughing)

1557
00:53:37,656 --> 00:53:38,995
He's so charming.

1558
00:53:38,996 --> 00:53:40,295
- He treats her wife so well too. - That's true.

1559
00:53:40,296 --> 00:53:41,695
They've seen each other for a long time.

1560
00:53:41,696 --> 00:53:42,925
How long have you dated?

1561
00:53:42,926 --> 00:53:45,066
Before we got married? About ten years.

1562
00:53:46,066 --> 00:53:47,436
You dated her for ten years?

1563
00:53:47,736 --> 00:53:50,306
Why did you date for ten years?

1564
00:53:50,536 --> 00:53:53,945
- We broke up and got back together. - When you were dating?

1565
00:53:53,946 --> 00:53:56,516
- Did you break up with her? - For how long?

1566
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:58,316
For a few months each.

1567
00:53:58,716 --> 00:54:00,016
It was always my fault.

1568
00:54:00,316 --> 00:54:02,415
It's amazing how he said it like that.

1569
00:54:02,416 --> 00:54:03,756
(Amazed)

1570
00:54:04,656 --> 00:54:05,986
He's so manly.

1571
00:54:06,316 --> 00:54:07,525
- Since we got married, - He pulls that off too.

1572
00:54:07,526 --> 00:54:09,086
We've never fought.

1573
00:54:09,726 --> 00:54:11,355
She scolded you and gave you another chance.

1574
00:54:11,356 --> 00:54:12,825
Exactly.

1575
00:54:12,826 --> 00:54:14,295
You didn't really break up.

1576
00:54:14,296 --> 00:54:15,525
- That's true. - Yes.

1577
00:54:15,526 --> 00:54:16,965
She yelled at you, and said, "Hey."

1578
00:54:16,966 --> 00:54:19,195
- "Gosh. Come back here." - She forgave me.

1579
00:54:19,196 --> 00:54:22,135
He took ten years, but you went to school together.

1580
00:54:22,136 --> 00:54:23,175
We're not so different.

1581
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,535
- Was it over 40 years? - She yelled at me and forgave me.

1582
00:54:24,536 --> 00:54:26,176
- Did you say 40 years? - Did you say 40 years?

1583
00:54:26,546 --> 00:54:27,645
It was 40 years.

1584
00:54:27,646 --> 00:54:28,945
If it was 40 years...

1585
00:54:28,946 --> 00:54:30,315
He's turning 60 soon.

1586
00:54:30,316 --> 00:54:32,116
Wasn't it about 250 years?

1587
00:54:32,676 --> 00:54:34,116
(Laughing)

1588
00:54:35,486 --> 00:54:37,215
Dex, how do you feel...

1589
00:54:37,216 --> 00:54:38,956
after shooting with us for half a day now?

1590
00:54:39,256 --> 00:54:40,385
I'm hungry.

1591
00:54:40,386 --> 00:54:41,386
What? No way.

1592
00:54:41,387 --> 00:54:42,485
- I want to eat more. - Really?

1593
00:54:42,486 --> 00:54:43,896
Yes. I'm hungry.

1594
00:54:44,396 --> 00:54:46,356
He has a different metabolism.

1595
00:54:46,396 --> 00:54:48,626
- That's good for the show. - Yes.

1596
00:54:49,266 --> 00:54:51,535
So can you tell me what we will have for dinner...

1597
00:54:51,536 --> 00:54:52,795
that will excite me?

1598
00:54:52,796 --> 00:54:55,906
We'll go to Gunja-dong Food Street.

1599
00:54:56,006 --> 00:54:57,906
(Gunja-dong Food Street)

1600
00:54:57,936 --> 00:54:59,606
This is Gunja.

1601
00:55:02,306 --> 00:55:04,876
(From a subway, university, and Grand Park to hospital!)

1602
00:55:05,476 --> 00:55:07,585
(This neighborhood has various businesses...)

1603
00:55:07,586 --> 00:55:09,686
(and floating population.)

1604
00:55:10,216 --> 00:55:12,816
(When the sun is about to set, )

1605
00:55:13,326 --> 00:55:14,955
(the empty streets...)

1606
00:55:14,956 --> 00:55:19,056
(become full of people that have come for good food.)

1607
00:55:19,726 --> 00:55:24,736
(Here, each of them spends their dinner differently.)

1608
00:55:25,566 --> 00:55:27,435
(What is today's DMR...)

1609
00:55:27,436 --> 00:55:29,265
(among the restaurants in the Food Street?)

1610
00:55:29,266 --> 00:55:30,436
So...

1611
00:55:30,576 --> 00:55:33,345
- It's something in season. - In season?

1612
00:55:33,346 --> 00:55:34,676
- I like things in season. - What's in season?

1613
00:55:35,476 --> 00:55:36,775
- What? Webfoot octopus? - It's totally in season.

1614
00:55:36,776 --> 00:55:38,175
What's in season?

1615
00:55:38,176 --> 00:55:39,516
- Webfoot octopus. - Is it webfoot octopus?

1616
00:55:39,546 --> 00:55:41,445
- Webfoot octopus. Goodness. - Are they in season?

1617
00:55:41,446 --> 00:55:42,916
They're totally in season.

1618
00:55:46,986 --> 00:55:49,785
(It's red and spicy.)

1619
00:55:49,786 --> 00:55:53,295
(Stir-fried webfoot octopus)

1620
00:55:53,296 --> 00:55:55,525
But there's another healthy dish...

1621
00:55:55,526 --> 00:55:57,066
- that makes a good competition. - Another one?

1622
00:55:57,266 --> 00:55:58,596
It's a famous restaurant in Gunja.

1623
00:55:58,796 --> 00:56:00,035
- It's eel. - Eel.

1624
00:56:00,036 --> 00:56:01,265
Eel.

1625
00:56:01,266 --> 00:56:02,906
But this place sells...

1626
00:56:02,936 --> 00:56:04,205
- conger eel, - Okay.

1627
00:56:04,206 --> 00:56:05,435
Freshwater eel,

1628
00:56:05,436 --> 00:56:07,376
and hagfish. They sell everything.

1629
00:56:08,106 --> 00:56:09,875
- Isn't it crazy? - Is there such a place?

1630
00:56:09,876 --> 00:56:11,176
(Eel for the ultimate recovery)

1631
00:56:12,376 --> 00:56:13,786
That's a strong option.

1632
00:56:14,046 --> 00:56:16,385
(So today's DMR)

1633
00:56:16,386 --> 00:56:18,055
Webfoot octopus is supposed to be good...

1634
00:56:18,056 --> 00:56:19,715
- for your health. - That's right.

1635
00:56:19,716 --> 00:56:22,425
- But so is eel. - Eel is equally healthy.

1636
00:56:22,426 --> 00:56:24,295
- It's one's preference now. - It's one's preference.

1637
00:56:24,296 --> 00:56:26,355
They are in the same category,

1638
00:56:26,356 --> 00:56:27,365
so one's personal taste will divide it.

1639
00:56:27,366 --> 00:56:28,965
When it's time to choose,

1640
00:56:28,966 --> 00:56:30,835
I do it quickly without thinking much.

1641
00:56:30,836 --> 00:56:32,536
- Have you decided? - What is it this time?

1642
00:56:32,666 --> 00:56:34,305
- I choose the webfoot octopus. - The webfoot octopus?

1643
00:56:34,306 --> 00:56:35,435
- Why? Why not the eel? - It's because...

1644
00:56:35,436 --> 00:56:37,706
it's not easy to taste the webfoot octopus in season.

1645
00:56:37,736 --> 00:56:40,045
The webfoot octopus in season has its head filled...

1646
00:56:40,046 --> 00:56:41,846
with roe that looks like rice grains.

1647
00:56:41,906 --> 00:56:44,676
- Gosh. It's such a delicacy. - That's crazy.

1648
00:56:44,716 --> 00:56:47,346
- You cut it, and the roe pours out. - Yes.

1649
00:56:47,486 --> 00:56:50,316
But it's good to be on Dex's team.

1650
00:56:50,586 --> 00:56:52,385
- I'll choose the octopus for now. - Just to eat?

1651
00:56:52,386 --> 00:56:53,485
Yes. Just to eat.

1652
00:56:53,486 --> 00:56:54,986
- I'm glad to hear that. - What?

1653
00:56:55,356 --> 00:56:57,525
We have different tastes. I'm more of an eel person.

1654
00:56:57,526 --> 00:56:58,655
Really?

1655
00:56:58,656 --> 00:57:00,696
I love eel so much.

1656
00:57:01,296 --> 00:57:02,566
And I realized a moment ago...

1657
00:57:02,796 --> 00:57:03,936
that he's stronger than I think.

1658
00:57:04,336 --> 00:57:05,635
- I see. - Look at him.

1659
00:57:05,636 --> 00:57:07,335
He pretends to be weak.

1660
00:57:07,336 --> 00:57:09,636
He's full of energy today.

1661
00:57:10,136 --> 00:57:12,535
His opponent lets the guard down because he pretends to be weak.

1662
00:57:12,536 --> 00:57:14,645
And that's when he strikes. So I'll avoid him this time.

1663
00:57:14,646 --> 00:57:16,076
Who would you like to have on your team?

1664
00:57:16,376 --> 00:57:19,215
I found someone with a weakness today.

1665
00:57:19,216 --> 00:57:20,216
Who is it?

1666
00:57:20,217 --> 00:57:21,586
He's the top fencer in the world.

1667
00:57:22,346 --> 00:57:25,316
He's the top player in the world, but for some reason...

1668
00:57:25,356 --> 00:57:27,486
Maybe it's because he only stabs when he is fencing.

1669
00:57:27,656 --> 00:57:28,725
- Since he only knows how to stab, - Right.

1670
00:57:28,726 --> 00:57:29,826
He's not that bright.

1671
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,125
Solving a quiz might not be his thing.

1672
00:57:32,126 --> 00:57:33,255
(The world's number 1 fencer is humiliated.)

1673
00:57:33,256 --> 00:57:34,425
Me too.

1674
00:57:34,426 --> 00:57:36,695
I'll follow my partner today.

1675
00:57:36,696 --> 00:57:37,866
I'll choose the eel.

1676
00:57:38,196 --> 00:57:39,435
Why? Is there a reason?

1677
00:57:39,436 --> 00:57:41,236
- To drink. - They're drinking partners.

1678
00:57:41,636 --> 00:57:43,405
I always want to drink.

1679
00:57:43,406 --> 00:57:44,475
Good.

1680
00:57:44,476 --> 00:57:46,176
Right. I'll choose the webfoot octopus.

1681
00:57:46,236 --> 00:57:47,245
- I see. - Why?

1682
00:57:47,246 --> 00:57:49,946
The eel is of no use to me anymore.

1683
00:57:51,376 --> 00:57:52,945
- That's right. - Will the energy be useless?

1684
00:57:52,946 --> 00:57:54,685
- It's excessive energy. - You don't fight with your wife.

1685
00:57:54,686 --> 00:57:55,945
- It's excessive. - Like a staring contest.

1686
00:57:55,946 --> 00:57:57,185
- Did you choose the octopus? - I did.

1687
00:57:57,186 --> 00:57:58,216
Me too.

1688
00:57:58,656 --> 00:58:00,756
It'll be excessive energy for us.

1689
00:58:00,926 --> 00:58:02,255
- Yes. - I've made my decision.

1690
00:58:02,256 --> 00:58:03,285
Have you?

1691
00:58:03,286 --> 00:58:04,755
Actually, I want the eel.

1692
00:58:04,756 --> 00:58:05,926
- That's right. - Goodness.

1693
00:58:06,026 --> 00:58:07,195
- Seung Ho has to join us. - I'm a fan of eel.

1694
00:58:07,196 --> 00:58:08,696
It's perfect because I chose the webfoot octopus.

1695
00:58:10,366 --> 00:58:11,896
- You? - I love food in season.

1696
00:58:12,096 --> 00:58:13,865
I love going to places that sell food in season.

1697
00:58:13,866 --> 00:58:14,965
And the webfoot octopus is in season right now.

1698
00:58:14,966 --> 00:58:16,875
The energy is balanced well among us.

1699
00:58:16,876 --> 00:58:19,306
It's not common to be divided equally.

1700
00:58:19,536 --> 00:58:21,276
So, where are we going?

1701
00:58:22,746 --> 00:58:25,215
- We'll have webfoot octopus first. - I knew it.

1702
00:58:25,216 --> 00:58:27,086
- It's better to eat later. -The webfoot octopus first.

1703
00:58:27,546 --> 00:58:28,946
The webfoot octopus first, then the eel.

1704
00:58:29,086 --> 00:58:30,586
The webfoot octopus first, then the eel.

1705
00:58:30,716 --> 00:58:32,255
Let's eat the webfoot octopus first.

1706
00:58:32,256 --> 00:58:33,525
Let's get healthy.

1707
00:58:33,526 --> 00:58:35,826
(Let's go to a webfoot octopus place to get healthy!)

1708
00:58:36,426 --> 00:58:37,756
Let's go.

1709
00:58:38,356 --> 00:58:39,495
Hello. Yes.

(Let's hurry.)

1712
00:58:44,596 --> 00:58:46,665
You have to have webfoot octopus when it's in season.

1713
00:58:46,666 --> 00:58:47,666
- You're right. - Yes.

1714
00:58:48,806 --> 00:58:50,076
Gosh. What is this scent?

1715
00:58:50,336 --> 00:58:51,836

- It smells good. - Hello.

It's filled with people at this hour.
It's filled right now.

1720
00:58:58,377 --> 00:58:59,415
It's only 6:30pm.

1721
00:58:59,416 --> 00:59:00,485
Since this is the food street,

1722
00:59:00,486 --> 00:59:02,516
all restaurants serve good food.

1723
00:59:03,516 --> 00:59:05,556
Hello.

1724
00:59:06,286 --> 00:59:08,186
- Handsome Boys? - Right.

1725
00:59:08,256 --> 00:59:10,655
- Handsome Boys? - They know us.

1726
00:59:10,656 --> 00:59:12,426
Hello. They called us Handsome Boys.

1727
00:59:12,496 --> 00:59:13,695
They knew who we were.

1728
00:59:13,696 --> 00:59:14,795
But they said Handsome Boys.

1729
00:59:14,796 --> 00:59:15,995
- "Boys." - Handsome Boys.

1730
00:59:15,996 --> 00:59:17,336
- Let's change our title. - That's still something.

1731
00:59:17,696 --> 00:59:20,105
Yes. Handsome Boys is cuter than Handsome Men.

1732
00:59:20,106 --> 00:59:21,266
"Handsome Men."

1733
00:59:21,536 --> 00:59:22,966
Is that the webfoot octopus place?

1734
00:59:23,336 --> 00:59:25,576
- I can tell it's good by the sign. - Is it here?

1735
00:59:25,906 --> 00:59:26,945
It must be it.

1736
00:59:26,946 --> 00:59:28,806
I can tell that it's a good restaurant.

I came here in April, and I enjoyed it so much.

1742

- Where did you come from? - From Daegu.

that when you see the menu...

1750

- of a great restaurant, - Yes.

1751
01:00:15,956 --> 01:00:18,395
- they only have 1 or 2 main dishes. - You're right.

1752
01:00:18,396 --> 01:00:19,495
Here, they only have one.

1753
01:00:19,496 --> 01:00:21,025
- Pork belly is a topping. - They don't sell many dishes.

1754
01:00:21,026 --> 01:00:22,026
- You're right. - It's not expensive.

01:00:25,936 --> 01:00:27,565
If it's 15 dollars per serving, it's a good deal...

1758
01:00:27,566 --> 01:00:29,206
- since it's in season. - Totally.

1759
01:00:29,706 --> 01:00:31,006
The webfoot octopus is imported from Vietnam.

1760
01:00:32,076 --> 01:00:33,376
The webfoot octopus from Vietnam.

1761
01:00:33,806 --> 01:00:37,216
(Precious webfoot octopus that has crossed the sea)

1762
01:00:37,816 --> 01:00:38,816
Hello.

1763
01:00:38,817 --> 01:00:39,875
- You're here. - Yes.

1764
01:00:39,876 --> 01:00:41,146
I'm sorry,

1765
01:00:41,216 --> 01:00:42,315
but the webfoot octopus...

1766
01:00:42,316 --> 01:00:43,385
might not be the in-season ones from Korea.

1767
01:00:43,386 --> 01:00:44,656
- Really? - It's from Vietnam.

1768
01:00:44,786 --> 01:00:45,916
It's in season in Vietnam.

1769
01:00:46,456 --> 01:00:47,456
(Shocked and betrayed)

1770
01:00:47,457 --> 01:00:49,126
- It's in season in Vietnam. - What?

1771
01:00:49,426 --> 01:00:52,895
It might still have roe in its head.

1772
01:00:52,896 --> 01:00:54,326
- Hold on. - Why?

1773
01:00:54,826 --> 01:00:56,196
You said it was in season.

1774
01:00:56,596 --> 01:00:58,065
We didn't say it was local.

1775
01:00:58,066 --> 01:00:59,495
Webfoot octopus is in season right now.

1776
01:00:59,496 --> 01:01:01,166
It's in season in Vietnam.

1777
01:01:01,406 --> 01:01:02,406
Right. You chose the eel.

1778
01:01:02,407 --> 01:01:04,206
- Hello. - Hello.

1779
01:01:04,676 --> 01:01:06,375
- It only says, "webfoot octopus." - Yes.

1780
01:01:06,376 --> 01:01:07,846
How do you serve it?

1781
01:01:08,076 --> 01:01:09,875
It's a stir-fry over a grill.

1782
01:01:09,876 --> 01:01:11,215
- It's a stir-fried one. - Yes.

1783
01:01:11,216 --> 01:01:12,216
- We stir-fry it. - Yes.

1784
01:01:12,217 --> 01:01:13,815
If you want it with pork belly,

1785
01:01:13,816 --> 01:01:15,145
you can add it as a topping.

1786
01:01:15,146 --> 01:01:16,646
- You can eat it that way too. - I see.

1787
01:01:16,956 --> 01:01:18,155
Webfoot octopus with pork belly sounds good.

1788
01:01:18,156 --> 01:01:20,055
Those who only want the webfoot octopus have it as is.

1789
01:01:20,056 --> 01:01:21,325
Is this place old?

1790
01:01:21,326 --> 01:01:23,155
It's been 20 years.

1791
01:01:23,156 --> 01:01:24,156
- What? - It's been 20 years.

1792
01:01:24,256 --> 01:01:25,355
- Selling only webfoot octopus? - Yes.

1793
01:01:25,356 --> 01:01:26,895
- At this location? - Yes.

1794
01:01:26,896 --> 01:01:27,996
I trust it will be good.

1795
01:01:28,096 --> 01:01:30,895
What is the best combination for the webfoot octopus?

1796
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:33,706
Would you recommend how we should order it?

1797
01:01:33,936 --> 01:01:35,635
Usually, for three people,

1798
01:01:35,636 --> 01:01:36,875
- they order 3 webfoot octopus... - Order 3 servings.

1799
01:01:36,876 --> 01:01:37,975
With 200g of pork belly.

1800
01:01:37,976 --> 01:01:40,175
They also order steamed eggs. After finishing them...

1801
01:01:40,176 --> 01:01:41,906
- They make fried rice. - That sounds perfect.

1802
01:01:42,406 --> 01:01:44,475
- "That sounds perfect." - It's an omakase course meal.

1803
01:01:44,476 --> 01:01:47,815
Gosh. It sounds like a never-ending course.

1804
01:01:47,816 --> 01:01:49,686
(The webfoot octopus is thoroughly cleaned...)

1805
01:01:50,586 --> 01:01:53,626
(and mixed with spicy sauce.)

1806
01:01:53,886 --> 01:01:56,026
- It must be hard. - Is it ready already?

1807
01:01:56,126 --> 01:01:57,326
- It's visually amazing. - Yes.

1808
01:01:58,126 --> 01:01:59,825
(Amazed)

1809
01:01:59,826 --> 01:02:01,295
- Turn on the heat. - It will be perfect with rice.

1810
01:02:01,296 --> 01:02:02,395
(It's simple, but everyone loves it.)

1811
01:02:02,396 --> 01:02:03,466
It smells good.

1812
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:09,466
(It will become super delicious in a moment.)

1813
01:02:09,936 --> 01:02:11,806
- It's big. - He was carrying the steamed eggs.

1814
01:02:12,236 --> 01:02:13,846
- And it looked so fluffy. - Yes.

1815
01:02:14,046 --> 01:02:15,645
Is this the thing they place underneath the raw fish?

1816
01:02:15,646 --> 01:02:17,346
- The kelp noodles. - Are they really kelp noodles?

1817
01:02:17,916 --> 01:02:20,216
- It's kelp noodles. - The clear thing below raw fish?

1818
01:02:20,286 --> 01:02:22,186
It looks like it.

1819
01:02:24,416 --> 01:02:25,785
You removed the stems.

1820
01:02:25,786 --> 01:02:27,955
- Yes. We serve them without stems. - You're right.

1821
01:02:27,956 --> 01:02:29,156
Do you remove the stems yourself one by one?

1822
01:02:29,286 --> 01:02:31,256
To make it easier for the customers to eat.

1823
01:02:31,526 --> 01:02:33,665
- It generates trash too. - You're so meticulous.

1824
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:35,526
A small detail makes a big difference.

1825
01:02:36,866 --> 01:02:38,796
- It said "Yongdu-dong." - Yes.

1826
01:02:38,896 --> 01:02:40,236
How is it different?

1827
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:43,236
We learned to make the sauce in Yongdu-dong.

1828
01:02:43,306 --> 01:02:45,136
And we've changed it into our style.

1829
01:02:45,776 --> 01:02:47,145
In Yongdu-dong,

1830
01:02:47,146 --> 01:02:49,676
there's a famous restaurant ran by an old lady.

1831
01:02:50,876 --> 01:02:54,215
We learned it from there and gave it a twist.

1832
01:02:54,216 --> 01:02:55,646
(A secret sauce they learned and made for 20 years)

1833
01:02:56,016 --> 01:02:58,886
The heat is higher on the outer side.

1834
01:02:59,356 --> 01:03:02,326
Dong Hyun, I'm sorry, but you seem to regret your choice.

1835
01:03:02,826 --> 01:03:03,855
It doesn't have roe in its head.

1836
01:03:03,856 --> 01:03:06,456
He deceived me.

1837
01:03:06,996 --> 01:03:09,825
He said it was in season.

1838
01:03:09,826 --> 01:03:12,736
I thought I'd be amazed when they bring out the live ones.

1839
01:03:12,836 --> 01:03:14,636
And I thought it'd be filled with roe.

1840
01:03:15,036 --> 01:03:16,106
But it's from Vietnam.

1841
01:03:16,406 --> 01:03:17,506
The eel...

1842
01:03:17,606 --> 01:03:19,305
- The sauce looks tasty. - Gosh. The eel.

1843
01:03:19,306 --> 01:03:20,606
I should have chosen the eel.

1844
01:03:21,146 --> 01:03:22,345
Sir.

1845
01:03:22,346 --> 01:03:23,816
Can we eat it now?

1846
01:03:24,746 --> 01:03:26,616
I'll put the bean sprouts in the middle first.

1847
01:03:26,776 --> 01:03:28,445
- What? - Yes. We should learn these things.

1848
01:03:28,446 --> 01:03:30,856
- I didn't know. - We have to add the bean sprouts.

1849
01:03:31,386 --> 01:03:33,215
You have to put them in the end.

1850
01:03:33,216 --> 01:03:34,586
Otherwise, it becomes a stew.

1851
01:03:35,086 --> 01:03:36,486
- From its water. - Yes.

1852
01:03:37,596 --> 01:03:39,595
So you mix the bean sprouts with the sauce quickly...

1853
01:03:39,596 --> 01:03:40,596
and eat them right away.

1854
01:03:40,766 --> 01:03:41,995
- And? - They must be crunchy.

1855
01:03:41,996 --> 01:03:43,266
And on a perilla leaf...

1856
01:03:43,766 --> 01:03:46,035
We make the pickled radish wrap ourselves.

1857
01:03:46,036 --> 01:03:47,436
- Really? - Put a slice of pickled radish.

1858
01:03:47,836 --> 01:03:48,836
How do they make the pickled radish wrap?

1859
01:03:48,837 --> 01:03:50,375
Add the pickled radish wrap on the perilla leaf.

1860
01:03:50,376 --> 01:03:51,406
- And? - And?

1861
01:03:52,136 --> 01:03:54,675
Add a piece of the webfoot octopus and a piece of pork belly.

1862
01:03:54,676 --> 01:03:55,705
Okay.

1863
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:57,376
Should I cut it?

1864
01:03:57,646 --> 01:04:00,315
No. It will shrink into small pieces.

1865
01:04:00,316 --> 01:04:01,446
- I see. - I forgot to add the radish.

1866
01:04:02,316 --> 01:04:03,716
Add a little bit of the kelp noodles.

1867
01:04:03,856 --> 01:04:05,915
- What? Do we add the kelp noodles? - The kelp noodles?

1868
01:04:05,916 --> 01:04:07,055
Instead of flying fish roe,

1869
01:04:07,056 --> 01:04:08,525
- you put them for texture. - My goodness!

1870
01:04:08,526 --> 01:04:09,825
(They'll add texture to the wrap.)

1871
01:04:09,826 --> 01:04:11,655
Dip a piece of garlic and chili...

1872
01:04:11,656 --> 01:04:13,526
in ssamjang and add them to the wrap.

1873
01:04:13,866 --> 01:04:15,795
- Gosh. Thank you. - Thank you.

1874
01:04:15,796 --> 01:04:16,796
(This is how you should eat it.)

1875
01:04:16,797 --> 01:04:18,835
This is the Yongdu-dong style.

1876
01:04:18,836 --> 01:04:20,836
(This is how you should eat it.)

1877
01:04:21,606 --> 01:04:24,205
(How does Gunja's famous webfoot octopus taste?)

1878
01:04:24,206 --> 01:04:25,536
It has to be tasty.

1879
01:04:26,106 --> 01:04:27,275
Tae Hyun was cute.

1880
01:04:27,276 --> 01:04:30,146
(Savoring)

1881
01:04:30,546 --> 01:04:32,416
(Savoring)

1882
01:04:34,086 --> 01:04:36,216
Hey. It's so good.

1883
01:04:37,356 --> 01:04:39,056
Why did you complain about it coming from Vietnam?

1884
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:40,786
Dong Hyun, the kelp noodles are so good.

1885
01:04:41,056 --> 01:04:42,685
- Really? - I see.

1886
01:04:42,686 --> 01:04:44,095
- Do they give it a kick? - Absolutely.

1887
01:04:44,096 --> 01:04:45,125
Really?

1888
01:04:45,126 --> 01:04:46,796
- It's different. - It bursts in my mouth.

1889
01:04:47,066 --> 01:04:49,066
- It gives an unexpected taste. - What's that?

1890
01:04:49,766 --> 01:04:51,466
- It's... Gosh! - Is it better than the duck stew?

1891
01:04:51,736 --> 01:04:53,235
- Suddenly, - Yes.

1892
01:04:53,236 --> 01:04:54,806
It gives me a big appetite.

1893
01:04:54,966 --> 01:04:56,105
It stimulates my appetite.

1894
01:04:56,106 --> 01:04:58,206
- You're having bipolar disorder. - No, I'm serious.

1895
01:04:58,436 --> 01:04:59,535
- What I mean is... - Seriously.

1896
01:04:59,536 --> 01:05:01,945
Let me tell you. You expect how it will taste, right?

1897
01:05:01,946 --> 01:05:02,946
But...

1898
01:05:02,947 --> 01:05:05,175
(The gochujang sauce we all know how it tastes)

1899
01:05:05,176 --> 01:05:06,945
- This is a bit sweet. - The kelp noodles?

1900
01:05:06,946 --> 01:05:09,216
When I had it, its sweetness stimulated my appetite.

1901
01:05:09,316 --> 01:05:10,385
Yes. It must be so tasty.

1902
01:05:10,386 --> 01:05:14,055
Also, with the kelp noodles, you can eat it endlessly.

1903
01:05:14,056 --> 01:05:16,226
Yes. You can eat it nonstop.

1904
01:05:16,356 --> 01:05:17,655
Usually, I don't make a wrap.

1905
01:05:17,656 --> 01:05:19,255
- I eat it as is. - You don't make wraps.

1906
01:05:19,256 --> 01:05:21,125
- I don't make wraps. - You have to put them in.

1907
01:05:21,126 --> 01:05:22,366
- It's so good. - You have to make wraps here.

1908
01:05:22,796 --> 01:05:23,896
What is this?

1909
01:05:24,736 --> 01:05:25,796
What is this?

1910
01:05:26,466 --> 01:05:27,505
- Really? - This place...

1911
01:05:27,506 --> 01:05:29,865
There's a reason people come here.

1912
01:05:29,866 --> 01:05:31,136
(There's a reason people come here for 20 years.)

1913
01:05:32,306 --> 01:05:33,975
It doesn't matter where the webfoot octopus is from.

1914
01:05:33,976 --> 01:05:35,005
It was sold for 20 years...

1915
01:05:35,006 --> 01:05:36,046
- for a reason. - Exactly.

1916
01:05:36,376 --> 01:05:38,315
We refilled the water parsley several times before.

1917
01:05:38,316 --> 01:05:40,815
We have to refill the kelp noodles seven times.

1918
01:05:40,816 --> 01:05:41,846
It's crazy.

1919
01:05:42,616 --> 01:05:44,486
- You make one wrap for each piece. - Yes.

1920
01:05:44,586 --> 01:05:46,555
He chopped the webfoot octopus nicely...

1921
01:05:46,556 --> 01:05:47,925
so it can fit into one perilla leaf.

1922
01:05:47,926 --> 01:05:49,455
It's a skill from 20 years of experience.

1923
01:05:49,456 --> 01:05:50,655
You should put the pickled radish first.

1924
01:05:50,656 --> 01:05:53,126
- Right. The pickled radish wrap. - Are you going to miss the order?

1925
01:05:53,256 --> 01:05:54,526
I forgot to put it in the last time.

1926
01:05:54,626 --> 01:05:55,866
- Also, - It's tasty.

1927
01:05:56,096 --> 01:05:57,265
The thickness of the webfoot octopus is perfect.

1928
01:05:57,266 --> 01:05:59,536
It's nice and chewy.

1929
01:05:59,936 --> 01:06:01,766
- Your eyes are shining again. - Totally.

1930
01:06:02,136 --> 01:06:03,405
It's amazing. I can eat this all day.

1931
01:06:03,406 --> 01:06:05,376
The doubt in his eyes has completely disappeared.

1932
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:07,905
(When he makes a big wrap and eats it, )

1933
01:06:07,906 --> 01:06:08,946
Gosh. It's good.

1934
01:06:10,616 --> 01:06:13,946
(his cheekbones go up with happiness.)

1935
01:06:16,146 --> 01:06:18,615
It's the best dish I've had on the show.

1936
01:06:18,616 --> 01:06:19,686
- What? - I'm serious.

1937
01:06:19,816 --> 01:06:21,226
- Is it the best one? - Me too.

1938
01:06:21,486 --> 01:06:22,926
- Gosh. This is... - Seriously.

1939
01:06:24,096 --> 01:06:25,255
- Sir. - Yes?

1940
01:06:25,256 --> 01:06:26,495
- This is crazy. - This is...

1941
01:06:26,496 --> 01:06:27,496
(What else do you need?)

1942
01:06:27,497 --> 01:06:28,666
- Even for me... - What's going on?

1943
01:06:29,026 --> 01:06:30,426
- I mean... - What's this?

1944
01:06:30,696 --> 01:06:34,405
The ingredients are not shipped directly from the producers.

1945
01:06:34,406 --> 01:06:36,465
But they've still sold it for 20 years.

1946
01:06:36,466 --> 01:06:38,305
- I understand why. - Thank you.

1947
01:06:38,306 --> 01:06:39,575
It's addictive.

1948
01:06:39,576 --> 01:06:40,576
(If you don't need anything else...)

1949
01:06:40,577 --> 01:06:43,606
- Also... - Dong Hyun, you asked for him.

1950
01:06:43,946 --> 01:06:45,345
He's leaving because you looked only at us.

1951
01:06:45,346 --> 01:06:46,346
- Sir. - Yes.

1952
01:06:46,347 --> 01:06:50,016
(Amazed)

1953
01:06:50,216 --> 01:06:52,855
Sir, it means it's delicious.

1954
01:06:52,856 --> 01:06:54,186
- It's really... - Thank you.

1955
01:06:54,286 --> 01:06:55,785
Please give us the quiz.

1956
01:06:55,786 --> 01:06:56,855
With this momentum,

1957
01:06:56,856 --> 01:06:58,125
let's do a quiz as it's only for a bite.

1958
01:06:58,126 --> 01:06:59,825
- I really want to try it. - It's a free bite.

1959
01:06:59,826 --> 01:07:01,496
- I'm really curious about it. - This is...

1960
01:07:01,566 --> 01:07:02,595
Can we play a quiz...

1961
01:07:02,596 --> 01:07:04,136
- and have a wrap? - A wrap.

1962
01:07:04,596 --> 01:07:05,665
- Excuse me? - What?

1963
01:07:05,666 --> 01:07:06,865
Excuse me.

1964
01:07:06,866 --> 01:07:08,166
- But... - Please listen to us.

1965
01:07:08,306 --> 01:07:09,665
- Hold on. - We want to play the quiz.

1966
01:07:09,666 --> 01:07:11,576
- The quiz? - The quiz. Yes.

1967
01:07:11,636 --> 01:07:12,735
Hold on. This is...

1968
01:07:12,736 --> 01:07:13,775
- It looks so good. - Yes.

1969
01:07:13,776 --> 01:07:14,876
It's really...

1970
01:07:15,176 --> 01:07:17,346
(Hesitating)

1971
01:07:17,516 --> 01:07:18,815
He forgot what he didn't put.

1972
01:07:18,816 --> 01:07:20,745
Yes. I forgot. You have to be smart to make this wrap.

1973
01:07:20,746 --> 01:07:22,215
- Should we not talk to you? - You have to be smart.

1974
01:07:22,216 --> 01:07:24,616
You might end up adding two pieces of the webfoot octopus.

1975
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:26,215
You have to use your brain.

1976
01:07:26,216 --> 01:07:27,525
Did I put everything right?

1977
01:07:27,526 --> 01:07:29,926
- You can't miss a thing. - He's serious about it.

1978
01:07:30,556 --> 01:07:33,395
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight ingredients.

1979
01:07:33,396 --> 01:07:34,825
Let's hurry and play the quiz. I crave it.

1980
01:07:34,826 --> 01:07:36,865
- Hey. This is... - It needs eight ingredients.

1981
01:07:36,866 --> 01:07:37,896
(Done checking)

1982
01:07:38,296 --> 01:07:39,365
- This is crazy. - Tae Hyun,

1983
01:07:39,366 --> 01:07:40,436
is it okay to play the quiz?

1984
01:07:40,566 --> 01:07:44,376
(The wrap tastes even better because it was difficult to make.)

1985
01:07:44,476 --> 01:07:46,476
- There's no pork belly. - It has been seasoned perfectly.

1986
01:07:46,876 --> 01:07:48,276
You know,

1987
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:52,316
I can see why people add the pork belly topping.

1988
01:07:52,646 --> 01:07:54,285
- Pork belly. - Shall we add some pork belly?

1989
01:07:54,286 --> 01:07:56,445
Do you want to add some pork belly?

1990
01:07:56,446 --> 01:07:58,355
- Shall we do that? - Add some webfoot octopus as well.

1991
01:07:58,356 --> 01:08:00,186
No? Shall we just move on to ramyeon?

1992
01:08:00,416 --> 01:08:01,956
You should add two servings each.

1993
01:08:02,656 --> 01:08:04,096
We don't need two servings each.

1994
01:08:05,296 --> 01:08:08,166
(They're busy making a wrap.)

1995
01:08:08,296 --> 01:08:11,165
- Listen to me, okay? - They can't hear you.

1996
01:08:11,166 --> 01:08:14,435
Stop annoying me and just listen to me, okay?

1997
01:08:14,436 --> 01:08:15,436
Okay. Talk to us.

1998
01:08:15,566 --> 01:08:17,735
Hold on. Order two servings of webfoot octopus...

1999
01:08:17,736 --> 01:08:20,336
and two servings of pork belly. Order them right now.

2000
01:08:20,906 --> 01:08:22,306
Hurry up and press the bell.

2001
01:08:22,376 --> 01:08:25,046
Put down the wrap and order them! Hurry up and do it!

2002
01:08:25,076 --> 01:08:26,845
- They're just... - What are you guys doing?

2003
01:08:26,846 --> 01:08:28,845
- What do you want us to do? - Order additional toppings.

2004
01:08:28,846 --> 01:08:31,615
You know, we're busy.

2005
01:08:31,616 --> 01:08:33,885
There are eight side dishes, so we're very busy.

2006
01:08:33,886 --> 01:08:35,385
- Fine. Just press the bell. - We're too busy.

2007
01:08:35,386 --> 01:08:37,495
- I'll order the toppings. - Stop with your hands.

2008
01:08:37,496 --> 01:08:39,056
I didn't want to block the camera.

2009
01:08:40,426 --> 01:08:42,166
Eat it. It's okay.

2010
01:08:43,026 --> 01:08:45,095
Hold on. What did I miss? One, two...

2011
01:08:45,096 --> 01:08:47,235
Seriously, this is insane.

2012
01:08:47,236 --> 01:08:48,435
Please give us two servings...

2013
01:08:48,436 --> 01:08:49,436
- of webfoot octopus... - Okay.

2014
01:08:49,437 --> 01:08:51,576
And two servings of pork belly topping.

2015
01:08:51,706 --> 01:08:53,276
- To this table? - Yes.

2016
01:08:53,806 --> 01:08:56,776
I'm so shocked by their reactions.

2017
01:08:57,546 --> 01:09:00,516
- Sang Uk isn't saying anything. - He hasn't said anything.

2018
01:09:00,816 --> 01:09:01,816
(He's taciturn when he eats.)

2019
01:09:01,817 --> 01:09:03,485
- He's in a hurry. - I mean...

2020
01:09:03,486 --> 01:09:04,756
- My goodness. - It must be tasty.

2021
01:09:05,116 --> 01:09:06,555
- I don't understand. - What's this?

2022
01:09:06,556 --> 01:09:07,625
(They get the additional order of webfoot octopus.)

2023
01:09:07,626 --> 01:09:08,626
- Sir. - Stop it.

2024
01:09:08,627 --> 01:09:09,686
What's wrong with you?

2025
01:09:09,856 --> 01:09:11,355
(The new webfoot octopus gets added to the old one.)

2026
01:09:11,356 --> 01:09:13,925
The saltiness of the red seasoning is just right.

2027
01:09:13,926 --> 01:09:14,926
(The taste of the seasoning deepens.)

2028
01:09:14,927 --> 01:09:18,395
Had the webfoot octopus been thin, it wouldn't have been tasty.

2029
01:09:18,396 --> 01:09:19,865
- But it's thick. - It's thick. That's right.

2030
01:09:19,866 --> 01:09:21,405
- The texture... - These webfoot octopuses are big.

2031
01:09:21,406 --> 01:09:23,235
I know. Aren't the webfoot octopuses from Vietnam good?

2032
01:09:23,236 --> 01:09:25,605
- They're the best. Seriously. - My goodness.

2033
01:09:25,606 --> 01:09:26,736
(He spits out the wrap because it's so funny.)

2034
01:09:27,076 --> 01:09:28,375
Are they in season?

2035
01:09:28,376 --> 01:09:30,715
- They're in season all year long. - Are they in season?

2036
01:09:30,716 --> 01:09:31,775
They're the best.

2037
01:09:31,776 --> 01:09:34,085
Who cares if they're from Vietnam?

2038
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:35,545
I forgot about that because of the taste.

2039
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:36,846
He's busy eating.

2040
01:09:37,116 --> 01:09:38,386
What's this?

2041
01:09:38,916 --> 01:09:40,115
I don't understand.

2042
01:09:40,116 --> 01:09:42,226
Shall we have a quiz since you can hear us now?

2043
01:09:42,326 --> 01:09:43,985
- Let's have it now. - Okay.

2044
01:09:43,986 --> 01:09:44,995
- Shall we finally have a quiz? - For one person.

2045
01:09:44,996 --> 01:09:46,025
- One person. - One wrap?

2046
01:09:46,026 --> 01:09:47,865
- The full set. Seriously. - The full set?

2047
01:09:47,866 --> 01:09:48,966
- One person. - Okay.

2048
01:09:49,169 --> 01:09:51,008
What should be the question for the quiz?

2049
01:09:51,009 --> 01:09:53,509
- Let's do this instead of a quiz. - Like what?

2050
01:09:54,009 --> 01:09:56,908
- One. - No.

2051
01:09:56,909 --> 01:09:58,078
No?

2052
01:09:58,079 --> 01:10:01,218
- Dex doesn't disappoint. - He began right away.

2053
01:10:01,219 --> 01:10:02,419
- Take turns... - Okay.

2054
01:10:03,389 --> 01:10:04,958
To give an insect name.

2055
01:10:04,959 --> 01:10:06,389
I'll lose.

2056
01:10:06,559 --> 01:10:07,689
It should have three syllables in Korean.

2057
01:10:07,789 --> 01:10:10,689
Let's begin right away. Please do the countdown, okay?

2058
01:10:10,829 --> 01:10:11,829
- Okay. - Grasshopper.

2059
01:10:12,129 --> 01:10:13,129
Camel cricket.

2060
01:10:13,629 --> 01:10:14,669
Diving beetle.

2061
01:10:15,769 --> 01:10:17,028
I'm in trouble. I don't know.

2062
01:10:17,029 --> 01:10:21,768
- One, two, three, four... - Three syllables are hard.

2063
01:10:21,769 --> 01:10:22,938
- Time's up. - May...

2064
01:10:22,939 --> 01:10:25,079
- "May." - "May."

2065
01:10:25,239 --> 01:10:26,709
I was bound to lose.

2066
01:10:27,339 --> 01:10:28,949
- Me? - It's Seung Ho's turn.

2067
01:10:29,379 --> 01:10:31,719
- One, two... - Fruit fly.

2068
01:10:32,919 --> 01:10:34,118
Vinegar fly.

2069
01:10:34,119 --> 01:10:35,149
Botfly.

2070
01:10:35,789 --> 01:10:37,559
Flyfly. For goodness' sake.

2071
01:10:37,959 --> 01:10:39,588
(Seung Ho won.)

2072
01:10:39,589 --> 01:10:41,429
It was a hard one.

2073
01:10:43,189 --> 01:10:45,958
Spread out the perilla leaves.

2074
01:10:45,959 --> 01:10:47,258
There you go. That's good.

2075
01:10:47,259 --> 01:10:49,169
There are three!

2076
01:10:49,299 --> 01:10:50,568
(Three perilla leaves)

2077
01:10:50,569 --> 01:10:53,469
I thought there were 2. When did he add 1 more?

2078
01:10:54,099 --> 01:10:57,369
- All right. - I'll add pork belly first.

2079
01:10:57,809 --> 01:10:59,738
(One piece of pork belly)

2080
01:10:59,739 --> 01:11:00,838
(Two pieces of pork belly)

2081
01:11:00,839 --> 01:11:03,109
(Three, four pieces of pork belly)

2082
01:11:03,579 --> 01:11:04,919
(He covers them with pickled radish slices.)

2083
01:11:05,319 --> 01:11:06,319
(Then he adds another piece of pork belly.)

2084
01:11:06,579 --> 01:11:08,118
Three pieces of meat, two slices of pickled radish...

2085
01:11:08,119 --> 01:11:10,149
It's too big. It won't go into your mouth.

2086
01:11:10,849 --> 01:11:13,318
- All done. Webfoot octopus. - It won't go into your mouth.

2087
01:11:13,319 --> 01:11:15,828
- It won't go into your mouth. - It'll go in.

2088
01:11:15,829 --> 01:11:18,399
Isn't that a bowl of rice? Isn't that cheating?

2089
01:11:19,459 --> 01:11:21,128
- It's good, right? - He took a lot of food.

2090
01:11:21,129 --> 01:11:22,569
- It isn't big. - Hey, it's big.

2091
01:11:22,999 --> 01:11:25,468
Let's film it. Let's get a close-up shot.

2092
01:11:25,469 --> 01:11:26,499
I mean...

2093
01:11:27,099 --> 01:11:28,409
Gosh, it's too big.

2094
01:11:28,569 --> 01:11:29,668
It's too big.

2095
01:11:29,669 --> 01:11:31,079
It's practically a taco.

2096
01:11:31,609 --> 01:11:33,878
- It's a taco. You're right. - Seriously.

2097
01:11:33,879 --> 01:11:35,679
- It's a taco. - It's too big.

2098
01:11:35,809 --> 01:11:37,819
- I'll drip some sauce. - Okay.

2099
01:11:39,079 --> 01:11:40,379
Hey, it's like...

2100
01:11:40,649 --> 01:11:41,889
- You're like an artist. - It's a decoration.

2101
01:11:41,989 --> 01:11:43,918
- You're like a chef. - It's fine dining.

2102
01:11:43,919 --> 01:11:45,918
- A chef decorating the dish... - Fine dining.

2103
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,588
At a fine dining restaurant.

2104
01:11:47,589 --> 01:11:50,329
- The tears of a webfoot octopus. - A chef drawing something.

2105
01:11:51,399 --> 01:11:53,598
- It's complete. - Let's go.

2106
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,698
Let's go.

2107
01:11:54,699 --> 01:11:55,968
For goodness' sake.

2108
01:11:55,969 --> 01:11:57,129
(It's time to eat.)

2109
01:11:59,769 --> 01:12:00,769
It...

2110
01:12:01,609 --> 01:12:02,668
(He puts the entire thing in his mouth.)

2111
01:12:02,669 --> 01:12:04,839
- It went in. - He really did it.

2112
01:12:05,139 --> 01:12:06,239
Wipe your mouth.

2113
01:12:07,279 --> 01:12:09,449
What do the kelp noodles say in your mouth?

2114
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:11,049
Don't make him talk just yet.

2115
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:13,079
- He's getting there. - Yes.

2116
01:12:13,119 --> 01:12:16,189
A bit of food needs to go down for him to taste it. It's too soon.

2117
01:12:18,059 --> 01:12:20,288
I'm tired of watching people eat. I'm so curious about the taste.

2118
01:12:20,289 --> 01:12:22,389
(I eat when I'm tired.)

2119
01:12:22,659 --> 01:12:24,428
- The kelp noodles are sweet. - Yes, they're sweet.

2120
01:12:24,429 --> 01:12:26,398
- That's why I love the combination. - That's right.

2121
01:12:26,399 --> 01:12:28,198
- Kelp noodles do all the work. - It's the best combination.

2122
01:12:28,199 --> 01:12:29,298
- The combination. - Yes.

2123
01:12:29,299 --> 01:12:30,529
So it's sweet and salty.

2124
01:12:31,099 --> 01:12:33,738
Shall we have a quiz...

2125
01:12:33,739 --> 01:12:35,839
for a classic wrap that's made by you?

2126
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:38,778
- It's a famous quote. - You're into quotes these days.

2127
01:12:38,779 --> 01:12:39,779
(The second freeloading chance, guess the famous quote)

2128
01:12:39,780 --> 01:12:41,949
It's a famous quote by Voltaire.

2129
01:12:42,679 --> 01:12:47,249
"'Blank' is the only adventure open to the cowardly."

2130
01:12:48,119 --> 01:12:49,149
Let me answer.

2131
01:12:49,589 --> 01:12:50,889
Reading a book.

2132
01:12:50,989 --> 01:12:52,888
- Reading a book. - It's quite ingenious.

2133
01:12:52,889 --> 01:12:54,629
- Incorrect. - It was like a famous quote.

2134
01:12:54,889 --> 01:12:56,888
- Right? When you read a book, - It made sense.

2135
01:12:56,889 --> 01:12:58,228
You can have an adventure through imagination.

2136
01:12:58,229 --> 01:12:59,529
You're right.

2137
01:12:59,899 --> 01:13:01,129
A stroll?

2138
01:13:01,169 --> 01:13:02,769
- Incorrect. - Sleeping?

2139
01:13:02,829 --> 01:13:04,129
- Incorrect. - Exercising?

2140
01:13:04,299 --> 01:13:05,939
- Incorrect. - Dreaming.

2141
01:13:06,269 --> 01:13:08,209
- Incorrect. - You're good with famous quotes.

2142
01:13:09,039 --> 01:13:10,638
- Dex's famous quotes are nice. - Dex's famous quotes.

2143
01:13:10,639 --> 01:13:12,378
Famous quotes should be a bit poetic.

2144
01:13:12,379 --> 01:13:14,479
- I want to go in that direction. - Good.

2145
01:13:14,949 --> 01:13:16,779
The best adventure for the cowardly.

2146
01:13:17,209 --> 01:13:19,019
- Marriage. - Marriage?

2147
01:13:19,749 --> 01:13:21,089
It's an answer that's expected from a married man.

2148
01:13:22,349 --> 01:13:24,019
Are there more hints?

2149
01:13:24,319 --> 01:13:27,188
Fewer people go on this adventure these days.

2150
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:28,229
Circumcision?

2151
01:13:30,329 --> 01:13:31,598
You have a point.

2152
01:13:31,599 --> 01:13:32,798
It's the only adventure...

2153
01:13:32,799 --> 01:13:33,999
- Right? - open to the cowardly.

2154
01:13:34,769 --> 01:13:36,169
- Incorrect. - Okay.

2155
01:13:36,869 --> 01:13:38,039
- Marriage. - Back in the day...

2156
01:13:38,899 --> 01:13:40,339
- It must be marriage. - Seriously.

2157
01:13:41,369 --> 01:13:42,469
(What?)

2158
01:13:43,239 --> 01:13:44,269
Marriage.

2159
01:13:46,209 --> 01:13:47,508
- Marriage. - Dex is correct.

2160
01:13:47,509 --> 01:13:49,278
(Answer: Marriage)

2161
01:13:49,279 --> 01:13:50,409
- Was it really marriage? - You got it right.

2162
01:13:50,779 --> 01:13:52,778
- Tae Hyun said it first. - What was that?

2163
01:13:52,779 --> 01:13:54,178
- Tae Hyun said it first. - Really?

2164
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:55,549
- I just said it. - Was that the answer?

2165
01:13:56,189 --> 01:13:57,759
Tae Hyun, was it your best adventure?

2166
01:13:58,389 --> 01:14:00,919
(Laughing)

2167
01:14:01,589 --> 01:14:03,628
Sang Uk, make a tasty wrap for Dex.

2168
01:14:03,629 --> 01:14:04,659
- Okay. - There's food on the side.

2169
01:14:04,799 --> 01:14:06,499
Ding, dong. It's a delivery.

2170
01:14:08,529 --> 01:14:10,699
- How clean. - That's a proper wrap. How clean.

2171
01:14:11,539 --> 01:14:14,339
- It's a tasty wrap. - It was the cleanest bite.

2172
01:14:14,409 --> 01:14:16,369
Let me describe it in one sentence.

2173
01:14:16,769 --> 01:14:18,339
It's the best combination of sweetness and saltiness.

2174
01:14:18,639 --> 01:14:19,708
That's right.

2175
01:14:19,709 --> 01:14:22,609
A single wrap contained both sweetness and saltiness.

2176
01:14:22,849 --> 01:14:24,619
There was also spiciness,

2177
01:14:24,919 --> 01:14:26,219
so I could eat it endlessly.

2178
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:29,219
- Shall we ask for a receipt? - Okay.

2179
01:14:29,489 --> 01:14:31,689
Please give us the receipt.

2180
01:14:32,289 --> 01:14:33,518
- It's here. - One hundred dollars?

2181
01:14:33,519 --> 01:14:34,829
- Anyone could pay for it. - My guess is 69 dollars.

2182
01:14:35,129 --> 01:14:36,659
Gosh, the number is perfect.

2183
01:14:36,829 --> 01:14:38,728
- Is it 100 dollars? - It's exactly 100 dollars.

2184
01:14:38,729 --> 01:14:40,099
- Is it exactly 100 dollars? - It's exactly 100 dollars.

2185
01:14:40,159 --> 01:14:42,029
Tae Hyun, you've really changed.

2186
01:14:42,699 --> 01:14:43,699
He asked me earlier,

2187
01:14:43,700 --> 01:14:46,838
"Hey, didn't we eat just the right amount today?"

2188
01:14:46,839 --> 01:14:49,638
- We ate so much. - We ate so much.

2189
01:14:49,639 --> 01:14:50,808
- Here comes the quiz. - All right.

2190
01:14:50,809 --> 01:14:52,078
If they get it right and it falls to us,

2191
01:14:52,079 --> 01:14:53,108
the individual match will be insane.

2192
01:14:53,109 --> 01:14:54,239
I think they'll get it right.

2193
01:14:54,809 --> 01:14:57,878
In Korea, there are many proverbs that are related...

2194
01:14:57,879 --> 01:14:58,948
to seasonal food.

2195
01:14:58,949 --> 01:14:59,949
It's another quiz on a proverb.

2196
01:15:00,379 --> 01:15:01,789
- It'll be hard. - Among the following,

2197
01:15:02,389 --> 01:15:05,488
- which one isn't a real proverb? - It's a multiple-choice question.

2198
01:15:05,489 --> 01:15:07,828
- Okay. - It'll be easy.

2199
01:15:07,829 --> 01:15:10,928
One. Pacific sauries taste good when there's frost.

2200
01:15:10,929 --> 01:15:12,498
- It's correct. - Two.

2201
01:15:12,499 --> 01:15:15,798
If you get a boat full of Japanese seer fish in April,

2202
01:15:15,799 --> 01:15:17,768
even the Pyongyang inspector seems like a nephew.

2203
01:15:17,769 --> 01:15:22,509
Three. A sea bream in May is worse than chewing cowhide.

2204
01:15:22,569 --> 01:15:25,438
Four. The webfoot octopus in May calls the eel his brother,

2205
01:15:25,439 --> 01:15:26,909
and the eel calls him the elder.

2206
01:15:27,179 --> 01:15:29,108
These proverbs are so difficult.

2207
01:15:29,109 --> 01:15:31,519
I think number four is a bit strange.

2208
01:15:31,749 --> 01:15:33,148
Webfoot octopuses have a season,

2209
01:15:33,149 --> 01:15:36,389
but eels don't, to my knowledge.

2210
01:15:36,689 --> 01:15:38,388
They live in swamps all year long.

2211
01:15:38,389 --> 01:15:41,429
Are Pacific sauries in season when there's frost?

2212
01:15:41,689 --> 01:15:43,329
- That means it's winter. - This quiz is so hard.

2213
01:15:43,829 --> 01:15:45,558
I've only eaten canned Pacific sauries,

2214
01:15:45,559 --> 01:15:47,698
- not fresh ones. - Tae Hyun, when is there frost?

2215
01:15:47,699 --> 01:15:49,829
- Isn't there frost in winter? - May and June?

2216
01:15:50,369 --> 01:15:52,138
Frost in May and June?

2217
01:15:52,139 --> 01:15:53,738
- Isn't there frost in May and June? - Doesn't it come from a proverb?

2218
01:15:53,739 --> 01:15:55,538
- What? - When a woman gets vindictive...

2219
01:15:55,539 --> 01:15:57,338
Frost forms even in May and June. It comes from a proverb.

2220
01:15:57,339 --> 01:15:58,478
(When a woman gets vindictive, frost forms even in May and June.)

2221
01:15:58,479 --> 01:15:59,939
Frost doesn't usually form in May and June.

2222
01:16:00,539 --> 01:16:02,379
- So... - Frost in May and June?

2223
01:16:02,949 --> 01:16:05,019
That proverb means sea breams don't taste good in May.

2224
01:16:05,279 --> 01:16:08,488
Even if sea bream isn't in season,

2225
01:16:08,489 --> 01:16:10,288
it can't be as tough as cowhide.

2226
01:16:10,289 --> 01:16:11,958
- It's a cow heel. - It's cowhide.

2227
01:16:11,959 --> 01:16:13,988
- I see. - Did you think it was a cow heel?

2228
01:16:13,989 --> 01:16:15,328
- Yes, I did. - Hold on.

2229
01:16:15,329 --> 01:16:16,329
A cow heel?

2230
01:16:16,859 --> 01:16:19,029
- What are you talking about? - Seriously.

2231
01:16:19,259 --> 01:16:20,729
- A cow heel? - Imagine losing to him...

2232
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:22,728
- in an individual match. - A cow heel?

2233
01:16:22,729 --> 01:16:24,199
He has only focused on fencing.

2234
01:16:24,369 --> 01:16:25,868
What did you think it was?

2235
01:16:25,869 --> 01:16:28,339
Tae Hyun, listen.

2236
01:16:28,369 --> 01:16:30,038
We don't think...

2237
01:16:30,039 --> 01:16:32,538
it's either number 1 or number 2, right?

2238
01:16:32,539 --> 01:16:33,738
You think it's number three.

2239
01:16:33,739 --> 01:16:34,908
- I think it's number four. - It's a bit...

2240
01:16:34,909 --> 01:16:37,208
- How about you? - Let's ignore numbers 1 and 2.

2241
01:16:37,209 --> 01:16:38,379
- We're certain, right? - I think I know.

2242
01:16:38,979 --> 01:16:40,679
I don't know those proverbs,

2243
01:16:41,019 --> 01:16:42,919
but the answer is in the question.

2244
01:16:43,619 --> 01:16:45,459
Ask Dex which one it is.

2245
01:16:45,889 --> 01:16:47,358
- Dex, do you know? - Number four.

2246
01:16:47,359 --> 01:16:48,729
- Do you think it's number 4? - Number 4.

2247
01:16:49,329 --> 01:16:51,498
- Dex can pay if it's correct. - Okay.

2248
01:16:51,499 --> 01:16:52,528
We'll go with number four.

2249
01:16:52,529 --> 01:16:55,728
- We don't know the answer anyway. - Now,

2250
01:16:55,729 --> 01:16:57,468
- it needs to be correct. - If it's correct,

2251
01:16:57,469 --> 01:16:59,069
- you'll be very annoyed. - That's right.

2252
01:16:59,099 --> 01:17:02,239
Dex can pay if it's correct. There's no other way.

2253
01:17:02,309 --> 01:17:04,008
- Okay. Let's go with number 4. - Number 4.

2254
01:17:04,009 --> 01:17:05,679
- Let me answer. Number 4. - Number 4.

2255
01:17:06,009 --> 01:17:07,208
The webfoot octopus in May calls the eel his brother,

2256
01:17:07,209 --> 01:17:08,579
and the eel calls him the elder.

2257
01:17:09,179 --> 01:17:10,248
Number four.

2258
01:17:10,249 --> 01:17:13,048
(Among the following, which one isn't a real proverb?)

2259
01:17:13,049 --> 01:17:14,478
(The webfoot octopus in May calls the eel his brother, )

2260
01:17:14,479 --> 01:17:15,948
(and the eel calls him the elder.)

2261
01:17:15,949 --> 01:17:17,819
- Correct. - Is it correct?

2262
01:17:17,889 --> 01:17:19,058
It's correct!

2263
01:17:19,059 --> 01:17:20,788
(Is it correct?)

2264
01:17:20,789 --> 01:17:22,189
Hold on. In that case...

2265
01:17:22,829 --> 01:17:26,129
(He feels dizzy.)

2266
01:17:26,229 --> 01:17:27,458
The webfoot octopus in May calls the eel his brother,

2267
01:17:27,459 --> 01:17:28,668
and the eel calls him the elder.

2268
01:17:28,669 --> 01:17:31,398
We made up that proverb.

2269
01:17:31,399 --> 01:17:34,268
(They made up the proverb for the quiz.)

2270
01:17:34,269 --> 01:17:35,638
Dex is doing a lot of work today.

2271
01:17:35,639 --> 01:17:37,668
(Now, 1 of these 3 will pay.)

2272
01:17:37,669 --> 01:17:39,079
Dex gives without holding back.

2273
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:42,208
This is driving me crazy. I can't believe it's correct.

2274
01:17:42,209 --> 01:17:43,808
I don't know. If Dex gets out of paying...

2275
01:17:43,809 --> 01:17:45,779
after giving them the answer...

2276
01:17:46,719 --> 01:17:47,919
I need to get out of paying.

2277
01:17:48,449 --> 01:17:49,549
I can't pay twice.

2278
01:17:49,649 --> 01:17:51,148
- Now... - Let's begin the individual match.

2279
01:17:51,149 --> 01:17:53,688
- Let's go. - Let's decide who will pay.

2280
01:17:53,689 --> 01:17:55,228
- Here comes the question. - Okay.

2281
01:17:55,229 --> 01:17:58,059
- You'll get two blanks. - Okay.

2282
01:17:58,529 --> 01:18:02,399
In the past, our ancestors taught people how to eat food...

2283
01:18:02,429 --> 01:18:05,499
in relation to the four seasons.

2284
01:18:06,099 --> 01:18:10,139
Firstly, they told people to eat rice that was as warm as spring.

2285
01:18:10,409 --> 01:18:13,679
They told people to eat soup that was as hot as summer,

2286
01:18:13,809 --> 01:18:16,249
"blank" that's as cool as autumn,

2287
01:18:16,579 --> 01:18:19,948
and "blank" that's as cold as winter.

2288
01:18:19,949 --> 01:18:22,248
Which food items go in the blanks?

2289
01:18:22,249 --> 01:18:23,318
Let me answer.

2290
01:18:23,319 --> 01:18:24,619
The cool food item is paste.

2291
01:18:25,059 --> 01:18:26,589
Cool paste.

2292
01:18:27,189 --> 01:18:29,558
- The cool food item is paste. - Paste.

2293
01:18:29,559 --> 01:18:30,828
It must be paste.

2294
01:18:30,829 --> 01:18:34,198
Eat paste that's as cool as autumn.

2295
01:18:34,199 --> 01:18:35,199
Correct.

2296
01:18:36,329 --> 01:18:37,329
Correct.

2297
01:18:38,469 --> 01:18:41,198
Our ancestors always ate some kind of a paste...

2298
01:18:41,199 --> 01:18:42,939
as a side dish.

2299
01:18:44,309 --> 01:18:45,478
(Did he escape by himself?)

2300
01:18:45,479 --> 01:18:47,309
Dex survived after giving them the correct answer.

2301
01:18:48,109 --> 01:18:49,208
He survived.

2302
01:18:49,209 --> 01:18:51,649
Hold on. This is bad.

2303
01:18:52,619 --> 01:18:53,819
- I mean... - My goodness.

2304
01:18:53,849 --> 01:18:55,318
- The two of them... - He survived.

2305
01:18:55,319 --> 01:18:57,548
- The two of them are neck and neck. - He survived.

2306
01:18:57,549 --> 01:18:58,959
They rarely get chosen.

2307
01:18:59,519 --> 01:19:01,689
- All right. - Shall we go?

2308
01:19:01,759 --> 01:19:03,829
- What was the cold food item? - Jelly.

2309
01:19:04,029 --> 01:19:05,029
- Jelly. - Incorrect.

2310
01:19:05,030 --> 01:19:06,059
Liquor.

2311
01:19:06,599 --> 01:19:07,759
That must be it.

2312
01:19:08,399 --> 01:19:09,399
(Is it correct?)

2313
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,198
You have to specify what kind of liquor.

2314
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:12,338
Let's see.

2315
01:19:12,339 --> 01:19:13,439
- Correct. - Yes.

2316
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:16,138
I survived today as well.

2317
01:19:16,139 --> 01:19:17,968
Yi Kyung is really good.

2318
01:19:17,969 --> 01:19:19,679
I paid for two meals today.

2319
01:19:20,609 --> 01:19:22,208
I always survive in the end.

2320
01:19:22,209 --> 01:19:24,678
There's one of each. Rice, soup, paste, and liquor.

2321
01:19:24,679 --> 01:19:26,778
- One of each. - I knew that liquor should be cold.

2322
01:19:26,779 --> 01:19:28,988
- Seung Ho will pay again. - Yi Kyung is good.

2323
01:19:28,989 --> 01:19:30,849
This isn't my lucky week.

2324
01:19:32,019 --> 01:19:33,618
When we eat eels...

2325
01:19:33,619 --> 01:19:35,428
We'll eat eels by ourselves. I don't want us to fight.

2326
01:19:35,429 --> 01:19:36,928
I don't care if I pay.

2327
01:19:36,929 --> 01:19:38,758
- I'll get it right no matter what. - Eels.

2328
01:19:38,759 --> 01:19:39,858
I'll get it right no matter what.

2329
01:19:39,859 --> 01:19:41,469
(Determined)

2330
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:43,599
- It's 100 dollars. - Okay.

2331
01:19:43,929 --> 01:19:45,768
Everyone said that the food tasted amazing.

2332
01:19:45,769 --> 01:19:47,699
- Thank you. - Everyone loved it.

2333
01:19:50,169 --> 01:19:52,108
(While they were absorbed in the webfoot octopus, )

2334
01:19:52,109 --> 01:19:53,879
(the sun set completely in Gunja-dong.)

2335
01:19:55,149 --> 01:19:56,149
(The place that's always lit up)

2336
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:57,978
- It's time to eat eels. - I saved up 100 dollars.

2337
01:19:57,979 --> 01:19:59,518
- That's right. - Let's go and order a meal.

2338
01:19:59,519 --> 01:20:01,688
- All of these are restaurants. - I know.

2339
01:20:01,689 --> 01:20:02,849
(The place that's always lit up)

2340
01:20:02,949 --> 01:20:04,289
Look at these lights.

2341
01:20:04,349 --> 01:20:05,759
They're Korean style.

2342
01:20:05,989 --> 01:20:07,318
All of these are restaurants.

2343
01:20:07,319 --> 01:20:08,858
(The night in Gunja is more beautiful than the day.)

2344
01:20:08,859 --> 01:20:10,089
There's everything.

2345
01:20:10,229 --> 01:20:11,288
Tripe.

2346
01:20:11,289 --> 01:20:15,469
- I love this atmosphere. - There's a variety.

2347
01:20:15,699 --> 01:20:16,798
There's everything.

2348
01:20:16,799 --> 01:20:18,499
Only good restaurants can survive here.

2349
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:21,339
- These restaurants... - The competition is fierce.

2350
01:20:21,709 --> 01:20:23,009
- That's the place. - Really?

2351
01:20:23,539 --> 01:20:25,609
- Pungcheon eels. - Pungcheon eels.

2352
01:20:26,379 --> 01:20:27,609
How is this place so big?

2353
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:28,848
It's huge.

2354
01:20:28,849 --> 01:20:30,178
Gosh, what's this?

2355
01:20:30,179 --> 01:20:33,649
(The second DMR of Mount Acha)

2356
01:20:33,749 --> 01:20:36,419
(Eel)

2357
01:20:36,649 --> 01:20:40,919
(The perfect blend of strength and flavor)

2358
01:20:40,989 --> 01:20:43,329
(Customers fill up the big restaurant.)

2359
01:20:45,499 --> 01:20:46,758
I came from Gangnam.

2360
01:20:46,759 --> 01:20:47,899
This place deserves a thumbs-up.

2361
01:20:49,669 --> 01:20:51,169
I came from Seongnam.

2362
01:20:51,599 --> 01:20:52,999
It goes well with liquor.

2363
01:20:53,069 --> 01:20:56,309
I think eels are the more invigorating food.

2364
01:20:57,309 --> 01:20:59,408
I looked up eel restaurants since I was craving eels.

2365
01:20:59,409 --> 01:21:00,738
I came here because it looked nice.

2366
01:21:00,739 --> 01:21:02,878
It's so tasty.

2367
01:21:02,879 --> 01:21:04,648
The eels were so plump.

2368
01:21:04,649 --> 01:21:06,448
Do you recommend it for dinner?

2369
01:21:06,449 --> 01:21:07,748
Yes, I strongly recommend it.

2370
01:21:07,749 --> 01:21:09,249
It's the best stamina food in summer.

2371
01:21:10,219 --> 01:21:12,018
(DMR 2, Eel)

2372
01:21:12,019 --> 01:21:13,219
- This is incredible. - I can smell the food.

2373
01:21:13,859 --> 01:21:14,859
(The members check the price as soon as they sit down.)

2374
01:21:14,860 --> 01:21:16,029
It's cheap.

2375
01:21:16,089 --> 01:21:17,989
Isn't the price cheap since it's for two servings?

2376
01:21:18,029 --> 01:21:20,159
- Right. - It's so affordable.

2377
01:21:20,329 --> 01:21:22,199
Seung Ho, it looks like...

2378
01:21:22,369 --> 01:21:24,998
How are they alive if they're from the US?

2379
01:21:24,999 --> 01:21:26,398
- You're right. - Live hagfish.

2380
01:21:26,399 --> 01:21:28,238
- Yes. How are they alive? - It's fascinating.

2381
01:21:28,239 --> 01:21:29,838
I guess they have vitality.

2382
01:21:29,839 --> 01:21:31,309
- They have vitality. - It's fascinating.

2383
01:21:31,409 --> 01:21:33,209
- Shall we ask? - Let's ask.

2384
01:21:33,239 --> 01:21:34,309
Sir.

2385
01:21:34,409 --> 01:21:37,279
- Hello. - Hello.

2386
01:21:37,849 --> 01:21:38,918
- Sir, - Yes?

2387
01:21:38,919 --> 01:21:40,578
How is the price so affordable?

2388
01:21:40,579 --> 01:21:42,918
We run a seafood store ourselves.

2389
01:21:42,919 --> 01:21:44,249
- An outlet. - Yes.

2390
01:21:44,889 --> 01:21:46,388
Are the eels from Korea?

2391
01:21:46,389 --> 01:21:48,359
- Yes, they're from Honam. - Honam?

2392
01:21:48,689 --> 01:21:49,828
(The merits of an outlet)

2393
01:21:49,829 --> 01:21:52,828
(The price goes down since there's no margin for a broker.)

2394
01:21:52,829 --> 01:21:56,599
(The freshness goes up since they take care of quality.)

2395
01:21:56,999 --> 01:22:01,769
(That's why this eel restaurant is special!)

2396
01:22:01,869 --> 01:22:03,238
There's something we're the most curious about.

2397
01:22:03,239 --> 01:22:05,079
- You sell live hagfish. - Yes.

2398
01:22:05,109 --> 01:22:06,678
How do they stay alive if they come from the US?

2399
01:22:06,679 --> 01:22:08,779
They get anesthetized.

2400
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:10,509
- What? - Then they get shipped directly.

2401
01:22:11,109 --> 01:22:14,178
(Hagfish from Boston stay alive since they get anesthetized...)

2402
01:22:14,179 --> 01:22:15,918
(and shipped directly.)

2403
01:22:15,919 --> 01:22:18,659
They move like crazy. They move like snakes.

2404
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:20,558
Then we'll order...

2405
01:22:20,559 --> 01:22:22,789
- two servings of freshwater eels. - Okay.

2406
01:22:22,959 --> 01:22:25,228
Can we order one serving of conger eel and hagfish each?

2407
01:22:25,229 --> 01:22:26,428
- You can do that. - Can we do that?

2408
01:22:26,429 --> 01:22:28,099
- That'll be the order for now. - That'll be the order.

2409
01:22:28,469 --> 01:22:30,169
You need strong fire for eels.

2410
01:22:31,099 --> 01:22:32,269
The charcoal is nice.

2411
01:22:33,339 --> 01:22:35,969
- Here. - Is this one serving?

2412
01:22:36,039 --> 01:22:37,209
Two servings.

2413
01:22:37,239 --> 01:22:39,178
Is this 69 dollars?

2414
01:22:39,179 --> 01:22:40,778
- Yes. - It's so cheap.

2415
01:22:40,779 --> 01:22:42,578
It's from Simwon-myeon, Gochang, North Jeolla Province.

2416
01:22:42,579 --> 01:22:44,678
It's where the freshwater and seawater meet.

2417
01:22:44,679 --> 01:22:46,018
- Is that Pungcheon? - Yes.

2418
01:22:46,019 --> 01:22:47,678
Is there any truth in this?

2419
01:22:47,679 --> 01:22:50,148
People say that the tail is the best part for stamina.

2420
01:22:50,149 --> 01:22:52,018
- It's a false rumor. - It isn't true, right?

2421
01:22:52,019 --> 01:22:54,818
- The tail is harder to digest. - Really?

2422
01:22:54,819 --> 01:22:58,559
It's just something people say.

2423
01:22:58,899 --> 01:23:01,059
It's bound to be tasty, right?

2424
01:23:01,999 --> 01:23:03,669
It's not even cooked yet, but it already looks good.

2425
01:23:04,369 --> 01:23:07,039
"It's not even cooked yet, but it already looks good."

2426
01:23:07,099 --> 01:23:10,238
How could you say that about a raw eel?

2427
01:23:10,239 --> 01:23:12,108
- Today... - I'll have one glass only.

2428
01:23:12,109 --> 01:23:14,179
Don't say that. You should drink more.

2429
01:23:14,309 --> 01:23:15,708
You wanted to drink.

2430
01:23:15,709 --> 01:23:16,778
(They fill up their glasses.)

2431
01:23:16,779 --> 01:23:18,179
We'll eat eels.

2432
01:23:20,019 --> 01:23:22,018
- We'll eat eels. - We have the fighting spirit.

2433
01:23:22,019 --> 01:23:25,988
(Now, they wait solemnly.)

2434
01:23:25,989 --> 01:23:27,089
It'll be delicious.

2435
01:23:27,189 --> 01:23:28,528
They're coming up.

2436
01:23:28,529 --> 01:23:29,758
We should flip them over.

2437
01:23:29,759 --> 01:23:31,328
They became blowfish.

2438
01:23:31,329 --> 01:23:33,099
Yes. We should flip them over.

2439
01:23:33,829 --> 01:23:34,959
How nice.

2440
01:23:35,269 --> 01:23:36,469
They look delicious.

2441
01:23:36,699 --> 01:23:37,968
They became flat again.

2442
01:23:37,969 --> 01:23:39,839
- That's so funny. - They look pretty.

2443
01:23:40,199 --> 01:23:42,568
They became flat again thanks to the heat.

2444
01:23:42,569 --> 01:23:43,709
All right.

2445
01:23:43,969 --> 01:23:45,278
- They're so big. - Seriously,

2446
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:46,778
eels are better than webfoot octopuses.

2447
01:23:46,779 --> 01:23:48,038
- Eels are the best. - Eels are the best.

2448
01:23:48,039 --> 01:23:50,348
I had a bit of a regret when I saw...

2449
01:23:50,349 --> 01:23:52,818
the webfoot octopuses in a red sauce.

2450
01:23:52,819 --> 01:23:54,118
I almost regretted it too.

2451
01:23:54,119 --> 01:23:55,418
- But I was wrong. - This is it.

2452
01:23:55,419 --> 01:23:56,889
- I was wrong. - You're satisfied now.

2453
01:23:58,219 --> 01:24:00,258
It contains a lot of arginine.

2454
01:24:00,259 --> 01:24:01,558
Yes. Eels are really good for you.

2455
01:24:01,559 --> 01:24:02,858
Pungcheon eels are always expensive.

2456
01:24:02,859 --> 01:24:04,058
(Compared to the webfoot octopuses, eels are the older brothers.)

2457
01:24:04,059 --> 01:24:08,029
(These men want stamina.)

2458
01:24:08,899 --> 01:24:13,569
(A long wait for the taste of stamina)

2459
01:24:15,469 --> 01:24:17,169
I'd eat it now.

2460
01:24:17,539 --> 01:24:18,708
- Now? - I see...

2461
01:24:18,709 --> 01:24:21,109
- that he likes rare food. - You're going to get sick.

2462
01:24:21,339 --> 01:24:22,779
Is that so? I'll give you a piece.

2463
01:24:23,049 --> 01:24:25,009
Really? You should eat it when the owner tells you to.

2464
01:24:25,549 --> 01:24:27,248
He wants to eat it like that.

2465
01:24:27,249 --> 01:24:28,789
- It's his preference. - Yes.

2466
01:24:30,719 --> 01:24:32,058
It's a big piece.

2467
01:24:32,059 --> 01:24:34,419
(Mr. Rare decides to give it a go.)

2468
01:24:34,519 --> 01:24:35,828
Sir, is it okay to eat it now?

2469
01:24:35,829 --> 01:24:37,328
You should wait a bit more.

2470
01:24:37,329 --> 01:24:39,228
- He wants to eat it now. - He likes to eat it rare.

2471
01:24:39,229 --> 01:24:40,358
It should be cooked a bit more.

2472
01:24:40,359 --> 01:24:42,128
I'm okay with how it is now.

2473
01:24:42,129 --> 01:24:43,398
(I can't wait any longer.)

2474
01:24:43,399 --> 01:24:44,529
All right.

2475
01:24:45,069 --> 01:24:46,598
(Finally!)

2476
01:24:46,599 --> 01:24:49,069
- I... - Seung Ho's first piece of eel.

2477
01:24:49,509 --> 01:24:50,808
Will it stimulate his appetite?

2478
01:24:50,809 --> 01:24:51,979
(It's the end of the wait. The first piece of eel goes in!)

2479
01:24:52,079 --> 01:24:53,208
All right.

2480
01:24:53,209 --> 01:24:54,308
(He closes his eyes and feels the strength of eels.)

2481
01:24:54,309 --> 01:24:55,348
Thank you.

2482
01:24:55,349 --> 01:24:56,808
(He closes his eyes and feels the strength of eels.)

2483
01:24:56,809 --> 01:24:59,818
- Freshwater eels from Honam, Korea. - I bet it's chewy.

2484
01:24:59,819 --> 01:25:02,418
- It's a bit... - How is it still so hot?

2485
01:25:02,419 --> 01:25:03,689
(What's the price of the undercooked greed?)

2486
01:25:04,689 --> 01:25:06,818
- This is the right doneness for me. - Really?

2487
01:25:06,819 --> 01:25:09,058
I say this...

2488
01:25:09,059 --> 01:25:11,358
because it's so tasty.

2489
01:25:11,359 --> 01:25:13,698
The bones aren't tough at all.

2490
01:25:13,699 --> 01:25:14,898
(The bones aren't tough at all!)

2491
01:25:14,899 --> 01:25:16,168
- The bones. - You know,

2492
01:25:16,169 --> 01:25:18,598
there's the firm flesh you can only enjoy...

2493
01:25:18,599 --> 01:25:21,198
- when it's a bit undercooked. - Okay.

2494
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:22,509
- Let's eat. - Cut it.

2495
01:25:22,809 --> 01:25:25,338
- There's a hint of red in it. - When will they get cooked?

2496
01:25:25,339 --> 01:25:26,478
Which ones can be eaten?

2497
01:25:26,479 --> 01:25:28,208
- All of them are cooked. - All of them are cooked. Eat.

2498
01:25:28,209 --> 01:25:29,508
- Really? - They're fully cooked.

2499
01:25:29,509 --> 01:25:30,649
Eat your first piece...

2500
01:25:30,879 --> 01:25:32,479
- with ginger. - Okay.

2501
01:25:32,979 --> 01:25:35,418
Eat it as if it was sashimi.

2502
01:25:35,419 --> 01:25:37,889
- Get the natural taste of the eel. - Okay.

2503
01:25:42,029 --> 01:25:44,759
- It looks tasty. - They eat it with so much gusto.

2504
01:25:45,659 --> 01:25:47,829
- Gosh. - Seriously, eels are the best.

2505
01:25:47,899 --> 01:25:49,699
- It looks tasty. - This is it.

2506
01:25:50,599 --> 01:25:51,599
(My goodness)

2507
01:25:52,899 --> 01:25:54,398
This restaurant isn't good because it's cost-effective.

2508
01:25:54,399 --> 01:25:55,909
It's a proper eel restaurant.

2509
01:25:56,109 --> 01:25:58,238
(Blowing)

2510
01:25:58,239 --> 01:26:00,779
(Dex finally takes a bite!)

2511
01:26:02,149 --> 01:26:03,309
(Gosh!)

2512
01:26:04,949 --> 01:26:07,019
It's the taste of eels I hoped to have.

2513
01:26:07,379 --> 01:26:08,819
It isn't greasy.

2514
01:26:09,049 --> 01:26:11,719
The taste is clean, but it has the flavors of eels.

2515
01:26:11,919 --> 01:26:13,818
The delicious flavors hit you...

2516
01:26:13,819 --> 01:26:15,829
- without any fishiness. - It's so tasty.

2517
01:26:15,929 --> 01:26:17,528
Cost-effectiveness is important in good restaurants too.

2518
01:26:17,529 --> 01:26:19,099
They look so tasty and nice.

2519
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:20,258
They look nice. Yes.

2520
01:26:20,259 --> 01:26:22,068
(Seung Ho, you too. Don't stop.)

2521
01:26:22,069 --> 01:26:23,069
Thank you.

2522
01:26:23,669 --> 01:26:26,668
Shouldn't you leave behind 1 or 2 pieces of eels?

2523
01:26:26,669 --> 01:26:27,939
(Let me have some.)

2524
01:26:29,509 --> 01:26:30,539
Shouldn't you do that?

2525
01:26:30,609 --> 01:26:32,378
This is more satisfying...

2526
01:26:32,379 --> 01:26:33,609
than Korean beef.

2527
01:26:34,779 --> 01:26:37,648
- Sir, may we grill the rest? - Okay.

2528
01:26:37,649 --> 01:26:39,219
- I'll get them ready. - Okay.

2529
01:26:40,519 --> 01:26:42,018
(It's time for another glass.)

2530
01:26:42,019 --> 01:26:43,049
As we eat the eels...

2531
01:26:44,519 --> 01:26:45,959
(Sipping)

2532
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:51,089
- What are you doing, Dex? - Hold on, Yi Kyung.

2533
01:26:51,159 --> 01:26:52,529
- What's wrong? - I'm exhausted.

2534
01:26:52,799 --> 01:26:53,959
Do you have something tomorrow?

2535
01:26:54,099 --> 01:26:55,128
Yes. I do.

2536
01:26:55,129 --> 01:26:56,129
- What do I... - It seems like you're...

2537
01:26:56,130 --> 01:26:57,499
- making something up right now. - No.

2538
01:26:57,599 --> 01:26:58,639
No. I really do have something.

2539
01:26:58,839 --> 01:27:00,638
The boomer in the company.

2540
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:01,668
(Mr. Boomer)

2541
01:27:01,669 --> 01:27:02,669
The boomer.

2542
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:04,369
It's hard as you're a senior by many years.

2543
01:27:04,769 --> 01:27:06,439
You should be the senior if you find it annoying.

2544
01:27:07,039 --> 01:27:08,409
He's a total boomer.

2545
01:27:09,149 --> 01:27:10,748
- He's a TB. - No.

2546
01:27:10,749 --> 01:27:11,779
This is bad.

2547
01:27:12,419 --> 01:27:14,248
- But... - The live hagfish is ready.

2548
01:27:14,249 --> 01:27:15,319
- Oh, right. - What?

2549
01:27:15,489 --> 01:27:17,148
You have to make sure to film this well.

2550
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:18,488
- Is it from the US? - Yes.

2551
01:27:18,489 --> 01:27:20,288
- This is fascinating. - They have been knocked out.

2552
01:27:20,289 --> 01:27:21,459
- How is it done? - All of a sudden?

2553
01:27:22,029 --> 01:27:23,159
- How is it done? - All of a sudden?

2554
01:27:23,759 --> 01:27:24,988
- What? - Gosh, that surprised me.

2555
01:27:24,989 --> 01:27:26,198
(He was just adding more charcoal.)

2556
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:27,298
- Hold on! - That surprised me.

2557
01:27:27,299 --> 01:27:29,729
- Gosh. - I thought they were the hagfish.

2558
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:31,429
I thought you were putting the hagfish in here.

2559
01:27:32,299 --> 01:27:33,798
I was expecting them to be moving inside.

2560
01:27:33,799 --> 01:27:35,438
I thought it was some kind of performance.

2561
01:27:35,439 --> 01:27:37,368
- He suddenly opened this up. - I thought they were in the foil.

2562
01:27:37,369 --> 01:27:38,779
- They're here! - There they are.

2563
01:27:38,879 --> 01:27:40,308
- I see. - What's going on?

2564
01:27:40,309 --> 01:27:41,309
It's the fire.

2565
01:27:43,549 --> 01:27:45,279
- This is it. - I haven't seen them yet.

2566
01:27:46,349 --> 01:27:47,449
They're inside now.

2567
01:27:50,289 --> 01:27:52,189
- Hurry up. - Let's see them.

2568
01:27:52,219 --> 01:27:53,219
(Screaming)

2569
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:54,419
What are we supposed to do?

2570
01:27:54,759 --> 01:27:55,989
Let's see them.

2571
01:27:56,889 --> 01:27:58,058
What are we supposed to do?

2572
01:27:58,059 --> 01:27:59,598
(Everyone is panicking.)

2573
01:27:59,599 --> 01:28:00,899
One went inside.

2574
01:28:01,329 --> 01:28:03,169
My body feels itchy all of a sudden.

2575
01:28:03,429 --> 01:28:04,498
This is amazing.

2576
01:28:04,499 --> 01:28:06,569
- They're not aliens, are they? - What do we do with that one?

2577
01:28:06,799 --> 01:28:09,208
The skin was removed right after they were caught from the sea.

2578
01:28:09,209 --> 01:28:11,039
(They're being grilled nicely.)

2579
01:28:11,269 --> 01:28:13,479
- This tastes really good. - I'm curious.

2580
01:28:13,539 --> 01:28:14,578
This is really good.

2581
01:28:14,579 --> 01:28:15,579
- When you go to Jagalchi Market... - Really?

2582
01:28:15,580 --> 01:28:17,808
- It's the best. - Of course. This is the best.

2583
01:28:17,809 --> 01:28:19,448
This is the difference when something feels familiar.

2584
01:28:19,449 --> 01:28:21,648
It looks delicious now after being grilled like this.

2585
01:28:21,649 --> 01:28:23,188
It looks fine all of a sudden.

2586
01:28:23,189 --> 01:28:25,519
The first scene was something I had never witnessed.

2587
01:28:25,659 --> 01:28:26,758
I have seen this version a lot.

2588
01:28:26,759 --> 01:28:28,759
I know the taste of it.

2589
01:28:29,029 --> 01:28:30,728
- It looks delicious now. - Right.

2590
01:28:30,729 --> 01:28:31,858
A shot to cut the grease.

2591
01:28:31,859 --> 01:28:32,898
A shot!

2592
01:28:32,899 --> 01:28:34,628
- A shot to cut the grease! - A shot to cut the grease!

2593
01:28:34,629 --> 01:28:35,699
- A shot! - A shot!

2594
01:28:38,799 --> 01:28:40,969
(Spilling)

2595
01:28:44,269 --> 01:28:47,478
(Bottoms up)

2596
01:28:47,479 --> 01:28:48,609
A shot!

2597
01:28:48,879 --> 01:28:50,349
This is how it should be done.

2598
01:28:50,609 --> 01:28:52,218
A shot like a man!

2599
01:28:52,219 --> 01:28:54,779
I emptied my glass.

2600
01:28:54,979 --> 01:28:56,748
Why are your clothes wet though?

2601
01:28:56,749 --> 01:28:57,918
It's raining.

2602
01:28:57,919 --> 01:28:59,518
- Oh, I see. - The rain is dripping.

2603
01:28:59,519 --> 01:29:01,019
The rain is dripping. I need an umbrella.

2604
01:29:01,059 --> 01:29:03,188
So to beat a total boomer,

2605
01:29:03,189 --> 01:29:04,528
- that's what you have to do. - You have to be like him.

2606
01:29:04,529 --> 01:29:05,828
He just poured it on his shoulder so obviously.

2607
01:29:05,829 --> 01:29:07,258
That is what makes him so cool.

2608
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:08,528
That stops you from doing anything.

2609
01:29:08,529 --> 01:29:09,569
Was that why?

2610
01:29:09,729 --> 01:29:10,968
- Gosh. - You can have the hagfish...

2611
01:29:10,969 --> 01:29:12,199
once the redness goes away.

2612
01:29:12,239 --> 01:29:14,068
- Shall we try it now? - Yes. It's a bit like beef.

2613
01:29:14,069 --> 01:29:16,109
- Seung Ho should get the red one. - Please.

2614
01:29:16,709 --> 01:29:17,709
"Please."

2615
01:29:18,009 --> 01:29:20,278
- This looks raw. - It's fine.

2616
01:29:20,279 --> 01:29:21,878
I can't have this...

2617
01:29:21,879 --> 01:29:22,948
- Okay. - unless it's completely grilled.

2618
01:29:22,949 --> 01:29:25,008
Won't the bones be too strong with this one? Is it okay?

2619
01:29:25,009 --> 01:29:26,348
- This doesn't have any bones. - There aren't any bones.

2620
01:29:26,349 --> 01:29:27,678
- This doesn't have any bones. - This doesn't have any bones.

2621
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:29,788
But why did I hear a snap when it was cut?

2622
01:29:29,789 --> 01:29:31,888
It has something like a cartilage...

2623
01:29:31,889 --> 01:29:33,758
that's inside the body.

2624
01:29:33,759 --> 01:29:36,489
- Since I loved noodles, - Cartilage?

2625
01:29:36,659 --> 01:29:38,189
My dad would trick me that these were glass noodles.

2626
01:29:38,829 --> 01:29:40,498
I didn't want to eat this when I was younger,

2627
01:29:40,499 --> 01:29:41,899
so he told me they were glass noodles.

2628
01:29:42,599 --> 01:29:43,769
He said it was added inside.

2629
01:29:44,029 --> 01:29:46,069
That was how I started to eat hagfish.

2630
01:29:46,599 --> 01:29:48,138
This does look delicious.

2631
01:29:48,139 --> 01:29:49,139
(Taking a bite)

2632
01:29:50,269 --> 01:29:51,409
Is it good? How is it?

2633
01:29:51,639 --> 01:29:52,709
- Yi Kyung. - Yes?

2634
01:29:53,139 --> 01:29:54,878
- Hurry up and try one. - Now?

2635
01:29:54,879 --> 01:29:55,949
Okay.

2636
01:29:56,009 --> 01:29:58,478
- I'll help you. - How should I eat it?

2637
01:29:58,479 --> 01:29:59,719
- This one is fine. - It's fine?

2638
01:29:59,979 --> 01:30:01,979
- Just dip it in here. - Dip it in?

2639
01:30:02,249 --> 01:30:03,419
- Give it a try. - Just eat it?

2640
01:30:03,889 --> 01:30:06,689
(Yi Kyung takes a bite too.)

2641
01:30:07,489 --> 01:30:09,989
- Gosh! - That's the hagfish.

2642
01:30:10,429 --> 01:30:12,129
It feels crunchy inside.

2643
01:30:12,259 --> 01:30:13,329
- It's crunchy? - Really?

2644
01:30:13,659 --> 01:30:15,028
Have you never tried hagfish?

2645
01:30:15,029 --> 01:30:17,229
I never had the chance to.

2646
01:30:17,369 --> 01:30:19,169
- There aren't many places. - You've never tried this?

2647
01:30:19,499 --> 01:30:21,939
It feels like a dish that suits soju well.

2648
01:30:22,339 --> 01:30:23,968
- Really? - That's the feeling I get. Gosh!

2649
01:30:23,969 --> 01:30:25,908
(The boomer senior is summoned again.)

2650
01:30:25,909 --> 01:30:26,978
Right.

2651
01:30:26,979 --> 01:30:28,439
- Watch me drink. - Gosh.

2652
01:30:28,609 --> 01:30:30,279
- Don't drink it. - Any volunteers?

2653
01:30:31,009 --> 01:30:32,178
- Will the volunteer... - Volunteer!

2654
01:30:32,179 --> 01:30:33,579
Be able to have the hagfish right away?

2655
01:30:34,179 --> 01:30:35,718
- Will I get a piece? - The volunteer...

2656
01:30:35,719 --> 01:30:37,148
- will get a piece of the hagfish. - A piece of the hagfish?

2657
01:30:37,149 --> 01:30:38,648
(The volunteer will get a piece of the hagfish!)

2658
01:30:38,649 --> 01:30:39,788
- I'll do it then. - Volunteer!

2659
01:30:39,789 --> 01:30:41,689
- I'll do it. - Sang Uk...

2660
01:30:42,019 --> 01:30:43,628
- won a piece out of nowhere. - "Thank you!"

2661
01:30:43,629 --> 01:30:45,088
- That's a win for Sang Uk. - That's a win for Sang Uk.

2662
01:30:45,089 --> 01:30:46,098
Really?

2663
01:30:46,099 --> 01:30:49,598
He would've wanted to have the soju as well anyway.

2664
01:30:49,599 --> 01:30:51,398
- Really? - Of course.

2665
01:30:51,399 --> 01:30:52,399
Really?

2666
01:30:52,400 --> 01:30:53,639
(Getting a piece of the hagfish)

2667
01:30:55,239 --> 01:30:56,768
How can I not have a drink with this?

2668
01:30:56,769 --> 01:30:58,568
Let me have some soju too.

2669
01:30:58,569 --> 01:31:00,538
"He's really letting me have this?" This is what he's thinking.

2670
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:02,749
(He's really letting me have this?)

2671
01:31:04,179 --> 01:31:06,519
(Amazed)

2672
01:31:07,379 --> 01:31:08,818
(Eyes opening wide)

2673
01:31:08,819 --> 01:31:09,848
That's it.

2674
01:31:09,849 --> 01:31:12,019
I like this much better than the regular eel.

2675
01:31:12,489 --> 01:31:14,118
- Really? - You can't stop eating this.

2676
01:31:14,119 --> 01:31:15,359
I like this better than the regular eel.

2677
01:31:15,459 --> 01:31:17,129
You'll never get sick of this.

2678
01:31:20,029 --> 01:31:21,959
- Gosh. - It's disappointing to move on.

2679
01:31:22,629 --> 01:31:23,768
Gosh!

2680
01:31:23,769 --> 01:31:25,638
- This should've been last. - Right.

2681
01:31:25,639 --> 01:31:26,899
- Gosh. - Yi Kyung!

2682
01:31:27,539 --> 01:31:29,239
- Did you try it? - The hagfish is amazing.

2683
01:31:29,639 --> 01:31:31,039
Right? It's crunchy, right?

2684
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:34,879
The hagfish feels a bit like beef tripe.

2685
01:31:35,009 --> 01:31:36,308
- You feel something inside, right? - The texture...

2686
01:31:36,309 --> 01:31:37,609
It feels like the fillings inside the beef tripe.

2687
01:31:37,679 --> 01:31:38,979
Gosh, this is really good!

2688
01:31:39,479 --> 01:31:40,918
- I wish the two of you... - It's my first time trying this.

2689
01:31:40,919 --> 01:31:42,249
Would fall into the charms of the hagfish.

2690
01:31:42,419 --> 01:31:44,619
- This is how it tastes? - Dex's new discovery.

2691
01:31:44,789 --> 01:31:47,019
- I've never had the hagfish. - This tastes much better.

2692
01:31:49,559 --> 01:31:51,458
(It's good!)

2693
01:31:51,459 --> 01:31:53,529
(It's so good that it's giving me chills!)

2694
01:31:54,059 --> 01:31:55,128
(That means...)

2695
01:31:55,129 --> 01:31:56,129
Gosh!

2696
01:31:58,299 --> 01:32:00,439
This is just good for Sang Uk!

2697
01:32:00,569 --> 01:32:02,239
- Hold on! - Go ahead!

2698
01:32:02,269 --> 01:32:04,808
- Hey, come on! - There you go!

2699
01:32:04,809 --> 01:32:06,178
Nice one!

2700
01:32:06,179 --> 01:32:07,778
(What is going on?)

2701
01:32:07,779 --> 01:32:08,808
Then...

2702
01:32:08,809 --> 01:32:10,208
(He isn't celebrating.)

2703
01:32:10,209 --> 01:32:11,308
- Sang Uk is excited. - This is good for you.

2704
01:32:11,309 --> 01:32:12,918
- This is good for him. - Right. It's good for you too.

2705
01:32:12,919 --> 01:32:14,319
- It's good for me too. - It's a win-win situation.

2706
01:32:15,379 --> 01:32:16,418
That was hilarious.

2707
01:32:16,419 --> 01:32:17,918
Sang Uk is fishing in troubled waters.

2708
01:32:17,919 --> 01:32:20,019
Check this out! He wants more!

2709
01:32:20,319 --> 01:32:21,919
- Gosh, it's so good. - It's good, isn't it?

2710
01:32:22,119 --> 01:32:23,328
It feels like the meat is compressed.

2711
01:32:23,329 --> 01:32:24,329
- So... - Right.

2712
01:32:24,330 --> 01:32:26,398
- it feels really bouncy. - Right.

2713
01:32:26,399 --> 01:32:27,729
As soon as you take a bite, the meat juice...

2714
01:32:28,559 --> 01:32:31,269
bursts inside your mouth. Gosh.

2715
01:32:31,429 --> 01:32:33,369
This is my first experience with the charm of the hagfish.

2716
01:32:33,699 --> 01:32:35,299
Your glass is empty.

2717
01:32:35,369 --> 01:32:36,768
Is that so? Right.

2718
01:32:36,769 --> 01:32:38,138
Sang Uk.

2719
01:32:38,139 --> 01:32:39,179
(The volunteer starts setting things up.)

2720
01:32:39,279 --> 01:32:40,339
Great.

2721
01:32:41,439 --> 01:32:43,009
- Here. - Cheers!

2722
01:32:44,949 --> 01:32:46,979
- What? - Sang Uk.

2723
01:32:47,719 --> 01:32:49,588
- What? - Sang Uk.

2724
01:32:49,589 --> 01:32:50,719
Sang Uk!

2725
01:32:51,289 --> 01:32:52,889
- Sang Uk got betrayed! - Right.

2726
01:32:53,019 --> 01:32:54,118
- Sang Uk got betrayed! - You can have the hagfish...

2727
01:32:54,119 --> 01:32:55,219
if you drink this.

2728
01:32:55,359 --> 01:32:57,229
When he drank it,

2729
01:32:57,389 --> 01:32:58,998
Sang Uk looked really disappointed.

2730
01:32:58,999 --> 01:33:00,528
(The good days are over.)

2731
01:33:00,529 --> 01:33:01,999
You should come again tomorrow, Dex.

2732
01:33:02,099 --> 01:33:04,628
I just wanted to see you.

2733
01:33:04,629 --> 01:33:05,739
Same here.

2734
01:33:05,999 --> 01:33:07,138
- Gosh! - How much is it?

2735
01:33:07,139 --> 01:33:08,239
- What is it? - It's less than what I expected.

2736
01:33:08,499 --> 01:33:09,568
- How much is it? - I thought it would...

2737
01:33:09,569 --> 01:33:10,639
definitely go over that.

2738
01:33:11,339 --> 01:33:12,539
- What? - How much is it?

2739
01:33:12,779 --> 01:33:14,679
It's only 282 dollars.

2740
01:33:15,079 --> 01:33:16,579
- It's 282 dollars? - That's decent.

2741
01:33:16,709 --> 01:33:17,808
How does solving the quiz while eating sound?

2742
01:33:17,809 --> 01:33:19,278
That sounds good. Solving the quiz while eating.

2743
01:33:19,279 --> 01:33:21,449
- We'll do that. - I'm down.

2744
01:33:22,179 --> 01:33:24,148
The hagfish secretes a sticky mucus...

2745
01:33:24,149 --> 01:33:26,218
after receiving a threat.

2746
01:33:26,219 --> 01:33:27,219
Right.

2747
01:33:27,789 --> 01:33:29,329
When there's too much of the mucus,

2748
01:33:29,889 --> 01:33:32,599
the hagfish can put itself in danger of suffocation.

2749
01:33:33,829 --> 01:33:36,568
That is why it does a certain action...

2750
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:38,599
to prevent itself from suffocating.

2751
01:33:39,139 --> 01:33:40,498
What kind of action is this?

2752
01:33:40,499 --> 01:33:41,668
(The hagfish secretes a sticky mucus after receiving a threat.)

2753
01:33:41,669 --> 01:33:42,808
(What does it do to prevent itself from suffocating?)

2754
01:33:42,809 --> 01:33:43,809
This is hard.

2755
01:33:43,810 --> 01:33:47,038
I think it'll be better to think of this after turning into a hagfish.

2756
01:33:47,039 --> 01:33:48,309
Right. Okay.

2757
01:33:48,809 --> 01:33:50,378
When I get threatened,

2758
01:33:50,379 --> 01:33:52,209
- I secrete a sticky mucus. - Right.

2759
01:33:52,249 --> 01:33:53,678
There's too much of it...

2760
01:33:53,679 --> 01:33:55,319
that I might suffocate and die from it.

2761
01:33:55,889 --> 01:33:57,588
What could I do to survive?

2762
01:33:57,589 --> 01:33:59,759
Listen up. This is what I think it is.

2763
01:34:00,119 --> 01:34:01,189
It rubs against itself.

2764
01:34:01,359 --> 01:34:02,789
We saw the hagfish earlier.

2765
01:34:03,089 --> 01:34:04,158
They twisted themselves to the point that...

2766
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:05,228
they got knotted up.

2767
01:34:05,229 --> 01:34:08,029
That will remove the mucus when that happens.

2768
01:34:09,129 --> 01:34:10,669
- It twists itself? - The hagfish...

2769
01:34:10,799 --> 01:34:12,998
So it removes it while twisting its body.

2770
01:34:12,999 --> 01:34:15,069
(So it removes it while twisting its body.)

2771
01:34:15,439 --> 01:34:16,508
- Sounds right. - Just now,

2772
01:34:16,509 --> 01:34:17,738
they were twisting their bodies when they were about to die.

2773
01:34:17,739 --> 01:34:19,079
- They really twisted themselves. - Right.

2774
01:34:19,779 --> 01:34:21,639
But even a person would twist their body with that kind of heat.

2775
01:34:22,579 --> 01:34:23,909
Even a person would do that in this heat.

2776
01:34:24,449 --> 01:34:26,049
- Anyone would do that. - It's the same with Dong Hyun.

2777
01:34:26,119 --> 01:34:27,878
When we have two meals a day,

2778
01:34:27,879 --> 01:34:29,318
he twists and turns during one meal.

2779
01:34:29,319 --> 01:34:30,388
Right.

2780
01:34:30,389 --> 01:34:33,859
(Hagfish Dong Hyun)

2781
01:34:34,459 --> 01:34:37,029
But I saw the hagfish sneeze.

2782
01:34:37,929 --> 01:34:38,999
Sneeze?

2783
01:34:39,259 --> 01:34:40,458
- Right. I've seen that too. - It does that...

2784
01:34:40,459 --> 01:34:42,428
to clear out its throat. It screams too.

2785
01:34:42,429 --> 01:34:43,568
It makes noises.

2786
01:34:43,569 --> 01:34:45,068
I even pulled some tissues out of it before.

2787
01:34:45,069 --> 01:34:46,769
- He's a funny one. - I'm serious.

2788
01:34:46,839 --> 01:34:48,738
It could be heard from the container.

2789
01:34:48,739 --> 01:34:50,569
It was the sound of it blowing its nose.

2790
01:34:50,869 --> 01:34:52,168
- But... - I went to Thailand recently...

2791
01:34:52,169 --> 01:34:53,509
and the elephants flew there.

2792
01:34:53,939 --> 01:34:55,509
They can fly with their ears?

2793
01:34:55,849 --> 01:34:56,908
Hey, Dex.

2794
01:34:56,909 --> 01:34:58,709
Didn't you catch eels on "Fresh off the Sea?"

2795
01:34:59,479 --> 01:35:00,719
I did.

2796
01:35:01,549 --> 01:35:03,648
But those eels didn't have issues with breathing.

2797
01:35:03,649 --> 01:35:04,719
- I guess they were... - They were...

2798
01:35:05,619 --> 01:35:07,658
- Their noses weren't blocked. - The ones he caught...

2799
01:35:07,659 --> 01:35:09,159
- weren't hagfishes. - They were conger eels.

2800
01:35:09,489 --> 01:35:10,829
We caught conger eels.

2801
01:35:11,089 --> 01:35:12,529
As it was mentioned earlier,

2802
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:14,599
if they were to live close to the ground,

2803
01:35:14,929 --> 01:35:18,369
I think they would wipe it off while digging into the ground.

2804
01:35:19,369 --> 01:35:20,539
Like this?

2805
01:35:20,839 --> 01:35:21,968
- Right. - If they can't breathe,

2806
01:35:21,969 --> 01:35:23,209
they would try to get rid of it from around this area.

2807
01:35:23,939 --> 01:35:25,108
That makes sense.

2808
01:35:25,109 --> 01:35:26,738
I hear it's time to close up now.

2809
01:35:26,739 --> 01:35:28,278
- But... - Right.

2810
01:35:28,279 --> 01:35:29,749
Oh, okay.

2811
01:35:30,549 --> 01:35:33,079
He keeps doing this. It's time to close.

2812
01:35:34,149 --> 01:35:35,179
Well,

2813
01:35:35,949 --> 01:35:37,389
I have nothing to say if this isn't the answer.

2814
01:35:37,819 --> 01:35:39,389
But this is the only thing I can think of.

2815
01:35:39,719 --> 01:35:41,658
Seung Ho is usually right when he says that.

2816
01:35:41,659 --> 01:35:42,829
We should go with Seung Ho's answer.

2817
01:35:43,189 --> 01:35:44,459
Say it with confidence, Seung Ho.

2818
01:35:45,029 --> 01:35:46,228
- I'll say it with confidence. - Right.

2819
01:35:46,229 --> 01:35:47,259
Say it with confidence.

2820
01:35:47,359 --> 01:35:50,929
It twists itself to wipe it off.

2821
01:35:52,669 --> 01:35:54,038
It twists and rubs against itself.

2822
01:35:54,039 --> 01:35:55,568
It twists and rubs against itself to wipe it off.

2823
01:35:55,569 --> 01:35:56,639
I think I've heard about this before.

2824
01:35:58,669 --> 01:35:59,839
"When the hagfish..."

2825
01:36:00,439 --> 01:36:02,478
"finds it hard to move..."

2826
01:36:02,479 --> 01:36:04,279
"with too much mucus on its body,"

2827
01:36:04,849 --> 01:36:07,048
"it twists its body into a knot..."

2828
01:36:07,049 --> 01:36:09,888
"and pushes out the mucus from head to tail."

2829
01:36:09,889 --> 01:36:10,919
He's right!

2830
01:36:12,659 --> 01:36:13,788
- Gosh! - "And..."

2831
01:36:13,789 --> 01:36:14,818
What?

2832
01:36:14,819 --> 01:36:16,588
(And...)

2833
01:36:16,589 --> 01:36:17,828
"And..."

2834
01:36:17,829 --> 01:36:21,028
"when it is in danger of suffocation,"

2835
01:36:21,029 --> 01:36:22,698
"it sneezes..."

2836
01:36:22,699 --> 01:36:24,668
(When it is in danger of suffocation, )

2837
01:36:24,669 --> 01:36:26,199
(it sneezes to remove the mucus on the respiratory organ.)

2838
01:36:26,839 --> 01:36:30,738
(Why is this true?)

2839
01:36:30,739 --> 01:36:31,808
"to remove the mucus."

2840
01:36:31,809 --> 01:36:33,278
- Hold on. - Are there two answers?

2841
01:36:33,279 --> 01:36:34,439
So that is incorrect.

2842
01:36:35,179 --> 01:36:36,548
- Right. - Hold on.

2843
01:36:36,549 --> 01:36:38,279
- There were two parts. - Right!

2844
01:36:38,449 --> 01:36:39,778
- Are you serious? - Sneezing was the answer?

2845
01:36:39,779 --> 01:36:41,079
Did you really hear the sneezing?

2846
01:36:41,379 --> 01:36:42,749
No!

2847
01:36:43,049 --> 01:36:45,618
How would I have heard that?

2848
01:36:45,619 --> 01:36:46,918
What's up with this guy?

2849
01:36:46,919 --> 01:36:48,259
- That's amazing. - It was really sneezing?

2850
01:36:48,759 --> 01:36:50,028
It secretes mucus when under threat.

2851
01:36:50,029 --> 01:36:51,058
Right.

2852
01:36:51,059 --> 01:36:53,798
It rubs against itself...

2853
01:36:53,799 --> 01:36:54,958
because it's uncomfortable.

2854
01:36:54,959 --> 01:36:56,628
It's true that they do that,

2855
01:36:56,629 --> 01:36:58,499
but that when it's suffocating.

2856
01:36:59,239 --> 01:37:01,268
When it's suffocating because of too much mucus,

2857
01:37:01,269 --> 01:37:02,269
it sneezes.

2858
01:37:02,270 --> 01:37:04,409
I said that thinking it would never be the answer.

2859
01:37:04,809 --> 01:37:05,839
No way.

2860
01:37:06,209 --> 01:37:07,478
But that was way too hard.

2861
01:37:07,479 --> 01:37:09,608
I'll fully admit that we got it wrong.

2862
01:37:09,609 --> 01:37:10,678
Give us the quiz...

2863
01:37:10,679 --> 01:37:12,149
- for the individual round. - Right.

2864
01:37:12,209 --> 01:37:14,049
- One person will be exempted first. - Right.

2865
01:37:15,249 --> 01:37:17,688
"When eating eels with an elder in Japan,"

2866
01:37:17,689 --> 01:37:19,558
"there is something you must be careful with."

2867
01:37:19,559 --> 01:37:20,619
"What could that be?"

2868
01:37:23,159 --> 01:37:24,159
Dex.

2869
01:37:24,189 --> 01:37:26,559
You must not eat the meat from the torso first.

2870
01:37:27,199 --> 01:37:28,228
The thick pieces?

2871
01:37:28,229 --> 01:37:29,699
Not eating the meat from the torso first.

2872
01:37:29,799 --> 01:37:30,829
Incorrect.

2873
01:37:30,969 --> 01:37:33,139
I got it. You must not eat the last piece.

2874
01:37:33,639 --> 01:37:34,669
Incorrect.

2875
01:37:34,969 --> 01:37:36,008
I got it.

2876
01:37:36,009 --> 01:37:37,409
You must not eat the tail first.

2877
01:37:37,539 --> 01:37:39,609
You must not eat the tail first.

2878
01:37:41,109 --> 01:37:42,138
- Is it along those lines? - Incorrect.

2879
01:37:42,139 --> 01:37:43,848
- I got it. - Isn't it similar?

2880
01:37:43,849 --> 01:37:46,318
- It must be along those lines. - You must not offer the tail.

2881
01:37:46,319 --> 01:37:48,448
(You must not offer the tail.)

2882
01:37:48,449 --> 01:37:49,519
Correct.

2883
01:37:50,089 --> 01:37:51,918
- What does that mean? - It's unlike us.

2884
01:37:51,919 --> 01:37:54,218
In Japan, people think the meat from the torso...

2885
01:37:54,219 --> 01:37:56,088
is softer and more nutritious.

2886
01:37:56,089 --> 01:37:57,428
That is why the meat from the torso is preferred more.

2887
01:37:57,429 --> 01:37:59,258
The tail represents the "end."

2888
01:37:59,259 --> 01:38:00,328
It could mean,

2889
01:38:00,329 --> 01:38:01,998
- "You are out of luck." - It's a cultural thing.

2890
01:38:01,999 --> 01:38:03,329
This is why the tail is not offered to an elder.

2891
01:38:03,899 --> 01:38:04,899
- Nice one, Seung Ho. - Right.

2892
01:38:04,900 --> 01:38:05,968
I'm sorry.

2893
01:38:05,969 --> 01:38:07,038
- Congratulations. - Why feel sorry?

2894
01:38:07,039 --> 01:38:08,698
- You did well. - Seung Ho paid twice today.

2895
01:38:08,699 --> 01:38:10,738
- Right. - All right.

2896
01:38:10,739 --> 01:38:12,578
- I'm getting closer... - This is the last question...

2897
01:38:12,579 --> 01:38:13,579
to a loss.

2898
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:15,338
"Soybean noodles were usually eaten by commoners..."

2899
01:38:15,339 --> 01:38:17,408
"during the Joseon Dynasty."

2900
01:38:17,409 --> 01:38:18,948
"Nobles used this instead of soybeans..."

2901
01:38:18,949 --> 01:38:21,648
"to make the soup."

2902
01:38:21,649 --> 01:38:22,789
"What is this?"

2903
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:24,619
I think it'll be something similar to soybeans.

2904
01:38:24,849 --> 01:38:26,419
- Red beans! - Incorrect.

2905
01:38:26,659 --> 01:38:28,819
- Wouldn't it be along those lines? - Right. Go for it.

2906
01:38:28,889 --> 01:38:31,088
- Wouldn't it be some sort of grain? - Sorghum.

2907
01:38:31,089 --> 01:38:32,258
- Incorrect. - Foxtail millet.

2908
01:38:32,259 --> 01:38:33,259
Incorrect.

2909
01:38:33,429 --> 01:38:34,899
- Rice. - Incorrect.

2910
01:38:35,259 --> 01:38:36,898
(He uses all of his brain power!)

2911
01:38:36,899 --> 01:38:38,199
I don't have a clue.

2912
01:38:38,999 --> 01:38:40,069
I got it. Corn.

2913
01:38:40,999 --> 01:38:42,198
- Incorrect. - Shredded corn.

2914
01:38:42,199 --> 01:38:43,269
Incorrect.

2915
01:38:44,469 --> 01:38:45,609
Shredded corn?

2916
01:38:45,709 --> 01:38:46,709
For the texture.

2917
01:38:46,710 --> 01:38:48,839
It must've been ground with a millstone no matter what.

2918
01:38:49,749 --> 01:38:50,749
Acorn.

2919
01:38:51,249 --> 01:38:52,249
Incorrect.

2920
01:38:52,449 --> 01:38:54,648
- What is it? - You're so close.

2921
01:38:54,649 --> 01:38:56,018
You're almost there.

2922
01:38:56,019 --> 01:38:57,149
I got it!

2923
01:38:57,349 --> 01:38:58,349
Pine nuts!

2924
01:38:59,759 --> 01:39:00,759
Correct.

2925
01:39:01,989 --> 01:39:03,228
(Dex manages to get exempted as well.)

2926
01:39:03,229 --> 01:39:04,529
- Nice one. - You did well.

2927
01:39:05,289 --> 01:39:06,529
You did well.

2928
01:39:06,929 --> 01:39:08,158
That's what the nobles had.

2929
01:39:08,159 --> 01:39:09,699
But that sounds good.

2930
01:39:09,799 --> 01:39:11,798
- Pine nut porridge is good. - It would be really savory.

2931
01:39:11,799 --> 01:39:13,139
- Right. - Right.

2932
01:39:13,499 --> 01:39:15,568
Thank you, Yi Kyung. That was a great meal.

2933
01:39:15,569 --> 01:39:17,338
- This will make him come again. - Thank you.

2934
01:39:17,339 --> 01:39:18,939
Were you okay with having the drinks too?

2935
01:39:19,409 --> 01:39:21,839
I think the drinks helped me to eat even more.

2936
01:39:22,309 --> 01:39:23,508
- But... - I think I should be the one...

2937
01:39:23,509 --> 01:39:24,749
to talk about that.

2938
01:39:25,409 --> 01:39:27,619
- Well... - Did you enjoy the drinks?

2939
01:39:27,719 --> 01:39:30,149
- It suited well with the hagfish. - Right.

2940
01:39:30,689 --> 01:39:32,718
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2941
01:39:32,719 --> 01:39:34,258

01:40:30,157 --> 01:40:32,556
(Woo Il's wallet is under danger?)

2965
01:40:32,557 --> 01:40:33,866
(I will protect...)

2966
01:40:33,867 --> 01:40:36,396
(my wallet.)

2967
01:40:36,397 --> 01:40:38,196
(Do you think I will pay?)

2968
01:40:38,197 --> 01:40:41,607
(By the experienced attacks of the Handsome Guys, )

2969
01:40:42,007 --> 01:40:44,607
(his defence system breaks down.)

2970
01:40:44,807 --> 01:40:47,047
(Helpless)

2971
01:40:47,077 --> 01:40:48,576
You didn't think you would pay today, right?

2972
01:40:48,577 --> 01:40:50,877
(Will Woo Il be able to protect his wallet?)
