1
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,400
(Is it grilled fish...)

2
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:19,230
(or braised fish?)

3
00:00:19,231 --> 00:00:20,770
(Sweet and sour pork...)

4
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:22,470
(or cream shrimp?)

5
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:24,600
(After making that choice...)

6
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:26,910
(Exultation...)

7
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:29,341
(and regret)

8
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:31,441
(Anguish and resolution)

9
00:00:33,851 --> 00:00:35,011
This is amazing.

10
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:37,650
(For modern people who suffer from such a dilemma)

11
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:43,220
(The menu conflict agents, Handsome Guys)

12
00:00:43,221 --> 00:00:45,961
(It starts again today.)

13
00:00:46,391 --> 00:00:50,161
(Bundang, Gyeonggi Province)

14
00:00:51,101 --> 00:00:55,431
(Ordinary people's day that starts off busy)

15
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:58,601
- Hello. - Hello.

16
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:00,241
Hello.

17
00:01:00,671 --> 00:01:01,710
- Hello. - Hello.

18
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:03,340
(Is Seung Ho the first one to arrive today?)

19
00:01:03,341 --> 00:01:04,581
This is Shin Seung Ho's...

20
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:06,910
Let's not join him.

21
00:01:06,911 --> 00:01:08,151
Hello.

22
00:01:08,551 --> 00:01:09,781
"The Morning at Sunrise."

23
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:11,280
"The Morning at Sunrise."

24
00:01:11,281 --> 00:01:12,420
(Shin Seung Ho's "The Morning at Sunrise")

25
00:01:12,421 --> 00:01:13,921
- That's funny. - It's a new show.

26
00:01:14,851 --> 00:01:18,360
First, I will invite four special guests today.

27
00:01:18,361 --> 00:01:19,491
Please come in.

28
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,890
(In awe)

29
00:01:21,891 --> 00:01:23,500
We left him to improvise.

30
00:01:23,501 --> 00:01:24,660
Seung Ho, you're the best.

31
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:26,600
His new show is called "The Morning at Sunrise."

32
00:01:26,601 --> 00:01:27,870
He wasn't bothered.

33
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:29,770
- Right. - He wasn't bothered at all.

34
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:31,370
- I had to think for a moment. - Even when we tease him,

35
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:33,271
- he isn't bothered at all. - He'd survive anywhere.

36
00:01:33,371 --> 00:01:35,711
Last week, Seung Ho's absence was deeply felt.

37
00:01:36,911 --> 00:01:39,741
Whenever we went to a restaurant, no one made additional orders.

38
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:42,010
That's right.

39
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:43,151
(There was no additional order as Seung Ho wasn't there.)

40
00:01:43,721 --> 00:01:45,380
At a barbecue restaurant for dinner,

41
00:01:45,381 --> 00:01:46,920
the total was less than what we spent on lunch.

42
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:48,920
What was missing wasn't my intelligence.

43
00:01:48,921 --> 00:01:51,020
- Was it additional orders? - Yes, it was about food.

44
00:01:51,021 --> 00:01:52,720
If Seung Ho had been here, he'd have eaten three more.

45
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:53,761
That's right.

46
00:01:54,061 --> 00:01:55,330
We could really feel your absence.

47
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:57,230
Don't leave us anymore.

48
00:01:57,231 --> 00:01:58,860
- Okay, I'll do my best. - Don't leave.

49
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:00,771
(He promises to do his best today.)

50
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:02,501
We must have...

51
00:02:02,671 --> 00:02:04,170
guests again today.

52
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:06,671
We have two guests today.

53
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:08,510
- It will be packed again today. - Today...

54
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:10,010
- We have two guests today. - Okay.

55
00:02:10,011 --> 00:02:11,441
Welcome.

56
00:02:12,141 --> 00:02:13,310
- All right. - Yes.

57
00:02:13,311 --> 00:02:14,681
- Hello. - Hello.

58
00:02:14,951 --> 00:02:16,450
It's Poong.

59
00:02:16,451 --> 00:02:18,720
- Hello, Poong. - Hello.

60
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,421
It's Ryu Kyung Soo.

61
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:21,550
Hello.

62
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:22,551
(Unlimited acting skills, Ryu Kyung Soo)

63
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:24,960
(As Han Se Jin, the future business partner...)

64
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:26,190
(in "Our Unwritten Seoul")

65
00:02:26,191 --> 00:02:28,931
(A sentimental drama in 2025)

66
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:30,361
Han Se Jin?

67
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:34,371
(He showed his sly sense of humor and warmth.)

68
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:38,271
(However, an unexpected filmography)

69
00:02:39,041 --> 00:02:42,911
(He played a mysterious character Yeong Ho in "The Bequeathed.")

70
00:02:44,011 --> 00:02:45,440
(Cho Hoon, a villain at the center of authority...)

71
00:02:45,441 --> 00:02:46,910
(in "Yadang: The Snitch")

72
00:02:46,911 --> 00:02:48,580
Clean without leaving traces.

73
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:50,350
(With a broad acting spectrum across all genre)

74
00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:52,051
(Actor Ryu Kyung Soo)

75
00:02:52,651 --> 00:02:56,821
(One person who transcended the boundaries of cooking)

76
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:00,261
(They can't believe what they're seeing.)

77
00:03:01,191 --> 00:03:03,801
(Poop loach is made.)

78
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:09,331
(With outrageously shocking dishes, )

79
00:03:10,801 --> 00:03:14,741
(a dark chef threatening professional cooks, Kim Poong)

80
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,170
Hello.

81
00:03:16,171 --> 00:03:17,640
(Inhaling nervously)

82
00:03:17,641 --> 00:03:19,211
I don't know what I do.

83
00:03:19,441 --> 00:03:20,450
- Seriously. - Please...

84
00:03:20,451 --> 00:03:23,111
- define yourself. - I have no idea either.

85
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:25,150
Do you know his occupation?

86
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:26,621
Isn't he a chef?

87
00:03:27,121 --> 00:03:29,650
- I know him as a cartoonist. - That's impressive.

88
00:03:29,651 --> 00:03:30,691
I'm not sure.

89
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:32,721
I know him as a chef.

90
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,731
Could you be accurate? We know you as a chef,

91
00:03:36,931 --> 00:03:39,100
but are you actually a writer? Could you tell us exactly?

92
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:40,770
- Actually, I'm a webtoon artist. - Right.

93
00:03:40,771 --> 00:03:42,170
I'm a former webtoon artist.

94
00:03:42,171 --> 00:03:43,700
- What else? - I'm a former webtoon artist,

95
00:03:43,701 --> 00:03:45,841
and I'm also a screenwriter.

96
00:03:46,041 --> 00:03:48,040
- A screenwriter? - Yes, I wrote dramas.

97
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,170
- When did you become a chef? - And...

98
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:51,540
I've never been a chef.

99
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,610
- What? - That's true.

100
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:53,980
- Isn't he a chef? - I'm not a chef.

101
00:03:53,981 --> 00:03:55,150
- Aren't you a chef? - No.

102
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,380
He doesn't have a cooking license.

103
00:03:56,381 --> 00:03:57,780
I'm just a cook on TV shows.

104
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:58,850
(I'm a cook on TV shows.)

105
00:03:58,851 --> 00:04:00,590
- Are you really not a chef? - No.

106
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:03,690
Then what about your cooking skills?

107
00:04:03,691 --> 00:04:04,790
Were you born with them?

108
00:04:04,791 --> 00:04:08,630
Chefs usually follow certain rules.

109
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:11,100
Western food chefs follow western food rules.

110
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:12,631
Chinese cuisine chefs follow Chinese food rules.

111
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:15,230
I follow my own set of rules.

112
00:04:15,231 --> 00:04:16,231
Your set of rules?

113
00:04:16,232 --> 00:04:18,370
- I follow my own rules. - This is...

114
00:04:18,371 --> 00:04:20,541
I use MSG and everything.

115
00:04:20,971 --> 00:04:23,211
I struggle and do whatever I can.

116
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:25,210
That's impressive.

117
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:26,710
Kyung Soo, please introduce yourself.

118
00:04:26,711 --> 00:04:27,880
Hello.

119
00:04:27,881 --> 00:04:31,380
I'm Actor Ryu Kyung Soo.

120
00:04:31,381 --> 00:04:32,781
(The trendsetting actor, Ryu Kyung Soo)

121
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:34,490
(Nice to meet you.)

122
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:36,991
Recently, Kyung Soo was cast...

123
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,860
in "Our Unwritten Seoul."

124
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:41,131
- It was really amazing. - Right.

125
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:43,961
- It was really amazing. - Right.

126
00:04:44,001 --> 00:04:45,201
You played Han Se Jin.

127
00:04:45,261 --> 00:04:46,560
- Have you seen it? - Of course.

128
00:04:46,561 --> 00:04:47,901
I watched it three times.

129
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:49,200
Didn't you watch it too?

130
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,230
- I did. - Right?

131
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:51,270
- It was so much fun. - He played Han Se Jin.

132
00:04:51,271 --> 00:04:52,370
- It was a huge success. - Right.

133
00:04:52,371 --> 00:04:53,740
Exactly. He played two different roles.

134
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:55,440
- He played a double role. - Exactly.

135
00:04:55,441 --> 00:04:56,540
(What? I did?)

136
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:57,611
Kyung Soo played...

137
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:59,081
Didn't he play a triple role?

138
00:04:59,211 --> 00:05:00,911
- Or is it a double? - After you got a haircut...

139
00:05:00,981 --> 00:05:02,710
- Both Se Jin and Mi Ji. - Yes.

140
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:04,420
With Mi Ji, his acting was amazing.

141
00:05:04,421 --> 00:05:06,250
- Right. - Your role was the best.

142
00:05:06,251 --> 00:05:07,591
(Your role was the best.)

143
00:05:08,221 --> 00:05:09,251
I'm sorry.

144
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,721
- I enjoyed it very much. - "Your role was the best?"

145
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:14,961
A long time ago, Kyung Soo and I were...

146
00:05:15,031 --> 00:05:17,601
in an independent movie called "Baby Beside Me."

147
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:19,360
- It was about ten years ago. - Hold on.

148
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,900
Back then,

149
00:05:20,901 --> 00:05:23,300
was one of you the leading actor?

150
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:25,601
- He was the top leading actor. - The top leading actor?

151
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,510
And I played his friend.

152
00:05:27,511 --> 00:05:29,111
- You played his friend? - Yes.

153
00:05:29,411 --> 00:05:31,840
You met each other ten years ago...

154
00:05:31,841 --> 00:05:33,540
in that movie.

155
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,110
You see him again now that Kyung Soo became popular.

156
00:05:36,111 --> 00:05:38,020
- What if I had been... - He must feel proud.

157
00:05:38,021 --> 00:05:39,150
Full of myself back then...

158
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:41,321
for being the lead?

159
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:43,220
- You'd be in trouble now. - I don't even want to imagine it.

160
00:05:43,221 --> 00:05:44,291
(I don't even want to imagine it.)

161
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:46,461
Mr. Cook on TV shows.

162
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,231
Do you like to visit popular restaurants?

163
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:52,400
For me, there are before and after.

164
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:54,271
- In the past, I went to many. - I see.

165
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:55,971
But these days,

166
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,441
I mostly order delivery food.

167
00:05:57,671 --> 00:05:59,270
- It's because you're married. - I mostly order delivery food.

168
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:00,870
- And you have a child. - Right.

169
00:06:00,871 --> 00:06:02,511
- It's hard to cook. - As I usually order delivery food,

170
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:05,180
I have my standards...

171
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:07,711
for tasty delivery food places.

172
00:06:07,811 --> 00:06:09,980
- That's also nice. - When it comes to delivery food,

173
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:12,181
does the restaurant's name match the kind of food they serve?

174
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:13,820
- The restaurant's information? - Does the restaurant's info...

175
00:06:13,821 --> 00:06:15,120
match the kind of food they serve?

176
00:06:15,121 --> 00:06:16,950
Here's an example.

177
00:06:16,951 --> 00:06:18,660
One restaurant can sell naengmyeon,

178
00:06:18,661 --> 00:06:20,960
gimbap, and pork cutlet.

179
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:22,690
In that case, it has several restaurant names...

180
00:06:22,691 --> 00:06:24,131
and run them at the same time.

181
00:06:24,161 --> 00:06:26,600
It's possible that their food is good,

182
00:06:26,601 --> 00:06:28,201
but it loses credibility.

183
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:31,171
If it's a pork cutlet restaurant, it should sell pork cutlet.

184
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,200
- In that case, I order from there. - I see.

185
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:34,940
While keeping the same information,

186
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:37,411
I do my research online.

187
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:41,010
Is this a restaurant that runs well?

188
00:06:41,011 --> 00:06:42,711
- Even when you order it once? - Yes.

189
00:06:42,851 --> 00:06:44,080
- That sounds very tiring. - Here's why.

190
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:45,651
I order delivery food,

191
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:47,150
so such criteria are important.

192
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:48,720
Isn't it better to go to a popular restaurant instead?

193
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:50,721
(Isn't it better to go to a popular restaurant instead?)

194
00:06:50,761 --> 00:06:52,120
Then I would have to bring my child...

195
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:54,090
with a lot of things.

196
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:55,531
So those are what I look at.

197
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:57,161
- Yes. - What about you, Kyung Soo?

198
00:06:57,801 --> 00:06:58,860
Do you like to visit popular restaurants?

199
00:06:58,861 --> 00:07:00,931
Yes, I like to visit them.

200
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:03,300
I also like to drink while eating.

201
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:04,470
- You must like alcohol. - Yes.

202
00:07:04,471 --> 00:07:05,540
I like to pair food with alcohol.

203
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:06,970
On this show, it's possible...

204
00:07:06,971 --> 00:07:08,311
- to drink while eating. - It's possible.

205
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:10,780
- Secretly? - No, openly.

206
00:07:10,781 --> 00:07:12,611
- Why would you drink secretly? - Why would you?

207
00:07:12,841 --> 00:07:14,310
Then we would've told you secretly.

208
00:07:14,311 --> 00:07:15,780
Why would you drink secretly?

209
00:07:15,781 --> 00:07:16,980
(Drinking etiquette for a variety show beginner)

210
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:18,421
Do you like to go to old restaurants?

211
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:19,651
Restaurants with history?

212
00:07:19,921 --> 00:07:22,390
When a restaurant is old, it means...

213
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:24,690
- that it's been there for a while. - Right.

214
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:26,520
- So it has a strong foundation. - It's not competing anymore.

215
00:07:26,521 --> 00:07:27,830
Also, I get disappointed...

216
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:29,391
when a restaurant has a kiosk.

217
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:31,230
- Why? - I prefer...

218
00:07:31,231 --> 00:07:32,700
to ask questions to the restaurant owner.

219
00:07:32,701 --> 00:07:33,870
- For conversations? - It has no warmth.

220
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,471
I'd ask what he's confident about.

221
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:37,771
- For recommendations. - Yes, I'd ask for recommendations.

222
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:39,100
That's what I like.

223
00:07:39,101 --> 00:07:40,141
(We look forward to Kyung Soo's performance.)

224
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:42,040
Are we in Bundang today?

225
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:43,710
- Yes, we're in Bundang. - Okay.

226
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:46,140
More specifically, we're going...

227
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:47,211
to Jeongja-dong in Bundang.

228
00:07:47,511 --> 00:07:48,750
(Today's menu recommendation area, Bundang)

229
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:50,650
Bundang is...

230
00:07:50,651 --> 00:07:51,850
a planned city.

231
00:07:51,851 --> 00:07:54,420
It has various types of residential complexes...

232
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:56,290
like apartments, townhouses, and luxury homes.

233
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,691
What's good about Bundang is...

234
00:07:57,991 --> 00:08:00,191
that it's where the Naver office is located.

235
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:02,491
The green search engine company is here.

236
00:08:02,831 --> 00:08:04,461
You'll also find Doosan here.

237
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:08,370
As there's a huge floating population,

238
00:08:08,371 --> 00:08:09,531
tasty restaurants can survive...

239
00:08:09,871 --> 00:08:11,841
only when they're really delicious.

240
00:08:12,071 --> 00:08:13,840
It's full of such tasty restaurants.

241
00:08:13,841 --> 00:08:17,311
(What food will they meet in Bundang?)

242
00:08:19,111 --> 00:08:20,310
Which one of you...

243
00:08:20,311 --> 00:08:22,250
will recommend today's menu?

244
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,311
Who is it today?

245
00:08:23,511 --> 00:08:25,220
I'll be making the recommendations.

246
00:08:25,221 --> 00:08:28,490
Today's lunch in Bundang is...

247
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:31,520
- a battle of five-star chefs. - This is intense.

248
00:08:31,521 --> 00:08:32,761
"Five-star?"

249
00:08:33,021 --> 00:08:34,561
Wait, that's really intense.

250
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:36,961
It's intense especially during the day.

251
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:39,701
Prepared by chefs trained at five-star hotels.

252
00:08:39,831 --> 00:08:41,270
It's Indian cuisine...

253
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,471
and Thai cuisine.

254
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:44,940
(That sounds great.)

255
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:47,240
- Between Indian and Thai food, - That sounds good.

256
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:48,770
Won't it be a matter of personal taste?

257
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:51,111
When it comes to Indian food, we only know naan and curry.

258
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:53,010
When it comes to Thai food,

259
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:54,280
we simply know pad thai.

260
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:55,611
What's the difference between the two?

261
00:08:55,881 --> 00:08:57,821
I'm not a chef.

262
00:08:57,981 --> 00:08:59,550
Just tell us what you've heard.

263
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:01,890
As basic Indian food,

264
00:09:01,891 --> 00:09:04,220
most of us think that's curry.

265
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:05,260
Actually, it's masala.

266
00:09:05,261 --> 00:09:08,890
Masala is a mix of various spices.

267
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:11,601
- Its typical dish is curry. - Curry?

268
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:15,101
(A fantastic exotic flavor crafted with authentic spices)

269
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:19,541
(Indian cuisine, the essence of bold, rich flavors)

270
00:09:20,301 --> 00:09:21,710
(A tropical taste exploding on your palate...)

271
00:09:21,711 --> 00:09:23,111
(with a perfect balance of sweet and salty)

272
00:09:24,181 --> 00:09:27,310
(Thai cuisine, the essence of freshness and colorful diversity)

273
00:09:27,311 --> 00:09:30,881
(Today's LMR, Indian cuisine, Thai cuisine)

274
00:09:31,221 --> 00:09:33,350
What should we do today? Shall we decide?

275
00:09:33,351 --> 00:09:34,550
Where would you like to go?

276
00:09:34,551 --> 00:09:36,451
- The 2 guests should decide 1st. - Please decide 1st.

277
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:38,261
I would like...

278
00:09:39,191 --> 00:09:41,130
- Indian food. - Why?

279
00:09:41,131 --> 00:09:43,530
It's more rare than Thai food.

280
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:44,860
Aren't you...

281
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:47,001
- the pioneer type? - Yes.

282
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:48,600
- You like challenges... - I want to try something new today.

283
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:50,701
And taste new things. Indian food?

284
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:52,371
What about you, Writer Poong?

285
00:09:52,771 --> 00:09:54,370
Then I'll get Thai food.

286
00:09:54,371 --> 00:09:55,970
Why is that? Do you prefer Thai to Indian food?

287
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:57,071
I love Thai food.

288
00:09:57,271 --> 00:09:58,940
I also make Thai food...

289
00:09:58,941 --> 00:10:00,380
often at home.

290
00:10:00,381 --> 00:10:01,381
You do? What do you make?

291
00:10:01,382 --> 00:10:03,050
I make tom yum kung with ingredients...

292
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:04,420
- You make it at home? - Yes.

293
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:05,421
That's incredible.

294
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:07,151
He's a chef after all.

295
00:10:07,421 --> 00:10:09,150
I'm not a chef. How many times do I have to tell you?

296
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:10,220
That's amazing.

297
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:12,320
You can buy it as meal kits.

298
00:10:12,321 --> 00:10:13,490
If you can make tom yum kung,

299
00:10:13,491 --> 00:10:14,761
you're as good as a chef.

300
00:10:14,861 --> 00:10:16,131
There are easy ways.

301
00:10:16,231 --> 00:10:17,231
For me,

302
00:10:17,232 --> 00:10:19,200
- I'd always choose Thai food. - Right?

303
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,971
However, unless I try it today,

304
00:10:21,231 --> 00:10:22,871
I would never...

305
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:26,341
go to a Indian restaurant voluntarily.

306
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:30,110
So I'd like to try Indian food today.

307
00:10:30,111 --> 00:10:32,281
I got to see Kyung Soo today after a long time.

308
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:34,551
It'd be like traveling to India together.

309
00:10:34,951 --> 00:10:36,210
- You three for Indian food? - Them?

310
00:10:36,211 --> 00:10:37,651
- Yes. - These three for Indian food.

311
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:39,450
Then I'll get Thai food.

312
00:10:39,451 --> 00:10:41,420
(Seung Ho picks Thai food.)

313
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:43,220
- I'll also get Thai food. - Thai food?

314
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:45,161
I think there will be more options.

315
00:10:45,421 --> 00:10:46,691
The three of you pick Thai food?

316
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:48,290
- It's 3 and 3. - It's 3 and 3.

317
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,590
Pick whichever you want to join.

318
00:10:49,591 --> 00:10:51,230
I'll pick Indian food.

319
00:10:51,231 --> 00:10:53,131
- Coincidentally, my outfit color... - It's the curry color.

320
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:54,900
Shall we go in these groups?

321
00:10:54,901 --> 00:10:56,200
- Let's stand together. - I'll go this way.

322
00:10:56,201 --> 00:10:57,640
I picked Thai food.

323
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:58,740
Which place are we going first?

324
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,941
Today, between Indian and Thai food,

325
00:11:01,771 --> 00:11:02,810
- we'll get Indian first. - Yes.

326
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:03,910
(The first LMR is Indian food.)

327
00:11:03,911 --> 00:11:05,180
- Finally... - Gosh.

328
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:07,910
- This is amazing. - It's huge.

329
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:09,380
What? Unbelievable.

330
00:11:09,381 --> 00:11:11,421
(Sighing)

331
00:11:12,851 --> 00:11:17,051
(People gather in small groups for lunch.)

332
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:20,861
(With people in Jeongja-dong who are enjoying their meal)

333
00:11:21,661 --> 00:11:23,731
Gosh, what's this place?

334
00:11:24,801 --> 00:11:27,700
It must be a commercial-residential building.

335
00:11:27,701 --> 00:11:29,930
All of these are commercial-residential buildings.

336
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:30,940
I love this.

337
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:32,471
I can smell tasty restaurants already.

338
00:11:33,171 --> 00:11:34,411
Is it this much...

339
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:35,941
It must be back here.

340
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,911
What's inside here?

341
00:11:38,011 --> 00:11:39,980
When you're in Bundang,

342
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:41,581
you don't have to worry about food.

343
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:43,380
This place is full of food.

344
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:45,720
It has a food complex.

345
00:11:45,721 --> 00:11:46,880
There are so many.

346
00:11:46,881 --> 00:11:48,050
- Here we are. - Is it here?

347
00:11:48,051 --> 00:11:49,191
It's here.

348
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:56,491
(Filled with dozens of unknown spices)

349
00:11:57,631 --> 00:12:00,031
(Equipped with an Indian tandoor)

350
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,401
(Taj Mahal in Bundang?)

351
00:12:03,801 --> 00:12:09,341
(A place that serves a special meal for Bundang's office workers)

352
00:12:10,511 --> 00:12:12,710
The chefs are Indian.

353
00:12:12,711 --> 00:12:15,910
Tandoori chicken and naan are very delicious.

354
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:18,250
It's so delicious that I don't have to go...

355
00:12:18,251 --> 00:12:19,281
to India anymore.

356
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:22,651
(Where you can meet India in Bundang)

357
00:12:23,121 --> 00:12:26,561
(LMR 1, Indian cuisine)

358
00:12:27,461 --> 00:12:30,190
- Is he the restaurant owner? - I know.

359
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:31,931
Five-star hotels in India?

360
00:12:32,531 --> 00:12:33,600
Five-star and local?

361
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:35,471
The food must be authentic.

362
00:12:35,601 --> 00:12:37,570
They've worked at five-star hotels in India.

363
00:12:37,571 --> 00:12:38,740
There are several names.

364
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:40,700
- Work experiences of 10, 20 years. - Experience of 20 years?

365
00:12:40,701 --> 00:12:42,540
- There are a few. - Work experience of ten years.

366
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,811
It's true. They worked in India.

367
00:12:45,311 --> 00:12:46,810
You don't look Indian.

368
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:48,510
No, he's not Indian.

369
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,980
All the chefs in the kitchen are Indian.

370
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:53,951
I'm in charge of managing the restaurant.

371
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:56,420
Sourcing authentic ingredients...

372
00:12:56,421 --> 00:12:58,160
from India...

373
00:12:58,161 --> 00:13:00,220
- can't be very easy. - That's why...

374
00:13:00,221 --> 00:13:01,760
I go to India myself.

375
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:02,930
I buy spices from there.

376
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:04,830
There's a place called Tamil Nadu.

377
00:13:04,831 --> 00:13:06,300
- It's where we get our spices. - Tamil?

378
00:13:06,301 --> 00:13:08,571
We get our spices directly from the farms.

379
00:13:08,671 --> 00:13:11,001
- Under some kind of contract? - Yes.

380
00:13:11,241 --> 00:13:12,901
What should we order?

381
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:14,570
- Could you make recommendations? - First of all,

382
00:13:14,571 --> 00:13:16,470
we have special lunch sets.

383
00:13:16,471 --> 00:13:17,810
We have two cost-effective sets.

384
00:13:17,811 --> 00:13:19,010
We can pick a type of curry.

385
00:13:19,011 --> 00:13:20,950
Pick a type of curry, naan,

386
00:13:20,951 --> 00:13:22,581
and a beverage of your choice.

387
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:24,620
- For the curry... - Is this included?

388
00:13:24,621 --> 00:13:25,981
We can order this.

389
00:13:26,451 --> 00:13:28,220
- Palak paneer. - That's correct.

390
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:29,290
Isn't it palak paneer?

391
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:30,990
Kyung Soo, do you know what you want?

392
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:33,461
I'd like to get the most local Indian food.

393
00:13:33,591 --> 00:13:35,190
What's closest to being local?

394
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:36,330
In that case,

395
00:13:36,331 --> 00:13:38,060
makhani, tikka masala,

396
00:13:38,061 --> 00:13:40,060
butter chicken, and palak paneer.

397
00:13:40,061 --> 00:13:41,370
Shall we get these four?

398
00:13:41,371 --> 00:13:44,701
(They pick local styles of curry.)

399
00:13:45,341 --> 00:13:46,470
Please order butter naan no matter what.

400
00:13:46,471 --> 00:13:48,011
- We'll order butter naan. - Butter naan.

401
00:13:48,071 --> 00:13:49,710
Please order one garlic naan.

402
00:13:49,711 --> 00:13:50,910
Garlic naan as well.

403
00:13:50,911 --> 00:13:52,840
- And Dong Hyun. - Yes?

404
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:54,451
You know about lamb chop tandoori, right?

405
00:13:54,611 --> 00:13:55,910
- Lamb chop tandoori? - Is there lamb chop tandoori?

406
00:13:55,911 --> 00:13:57,780
It's full of protein.

407
00:13:57,781 --> 00:13:58,950
That sounds good.

408
00:13:58,951 --> 00:14:01,151
We'll get one lamb chop tandoori.

409
00:14:01,451 --> 00:14:03,420
I'll get lassi as my beverage.

410
00:14:03,421 --> 00:14:04,661
- Me too. - Plain or mango?

411
00:14:04,721 --> 00:14:06,161
It's white and delicious.

412
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:07,831
I'll get that too.

413
00:14:08,061 --> 00:14:09,160
This is good.

414
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:10,461
The menu is full of great options.

415
00:14:10,591 --> 00:14:11,731
This is wonderful.

416
00:14:14,401 --> 00:14:16,700
Have you had curry for lunch?

417
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:18,240
Yes, I mostly eat instant curry.

418
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:19,440
- Instant curry? - At home...

419
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:21,240
- Three-Minute Curry? - As a simple meal?

420
00:14:21,241 --> 00:14:23,771
At home, there's a way to make...

421
00:14:24,281 --> 00:14:26,840
- Three-Minute Curry into a curry... - What?

422
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:28,280
- with a more Indian flavor. - How?

423
00:14:28,281 --> 00:14:30,251
It's a way I invented...

424
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:32,180
- to cut corners. - I see.

425
00:14:32,181 --> 00:14:33,350
At home...

426
00:14:33,351 --> 00:14:36,551
When you order a delivery of lamb skewers, you also get cumin.

427
00:14:36,621 --> 00:14:38,590
At some point, you get a lot of leftover cumin.

428
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,160
- I have some at home. - Do you?

429
00:14:40,161 --> 00:14:42,431
Add it to Three-Minute Curry and microwave it.

430
00:14:42,731 --> 00:14:44,760
Suddenly, you'll think, "What is this?"

431
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:47,460
- Really? You should try it at home. - It will taste exotic.

432
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:49,031
- That's what will happen. - That's a useful tip.

433
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:50,870
- It's really nice. - It's a useful tip.

434
00:14:50,871 --> 00:14:52,500
It's quite delicious.

435
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:53,970
Could you give me more useful advice?

436
00:14:53,971 --> 00:14:56,370
Something simple you can make at home.

437
00:14:56,371 --> 00:14:57,640
This is popular these days.

438
00:14:57,641 --> 00:15:00,310
- There's Kim Poong-style ramyeon. - Please tell me. I love this.

439
00:15:00,311 --> 00:15:01,381
Ramyeon?

440
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:03,911
Personally,

441
00:15:04,251 --> 00:15:06,180
I like to keep ramyeon pure.

442
00:15:06,181 --> 00:15:09,821
However, I always add MSG to it...

443
00:15:10,221 --> 00:15:11,360
no matter what.

444
00:15:11,361 --> 00:15:12,860
- Additionally? - Yes.

445
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:14,060
Other than the soup powder?

446
00:15:14,061 --> 00:15:17,190
When you add about half a spoon of MSG to it,

447
00:15:17,191 --> 00:15:18,630
the taste gets much deeper.

448
00:15:18,631 --> 00:15:19,700
I want to try that.

449
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:21,500
It's like from drinking alcohol aged for 12 years...

450
00:15:21,501 --> 00:15:23,000
to 30 years.

451
00:15:23,001 --> 00:15:24,701
The broth turns into something that's aged for 30 years.

452
00:15:25,771 --> 00:15:27,100
I'm curious. I should try it.

453
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:29,871
Try it. You'll see that it tastes different.

454
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,041
It's definitely different.

455
00:15:31,111 --> 00:15:34,141
- Here's your beverage and salad. - The food is here.

456
00:15:34,651 --> 00:15:37,080
- Plain lassi. - That's for him.

457
00:15:37,081 --> 00:15:38,180
Is this it?

458
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:41,090
Is this the drink you get when you go to India?

459
00:15:41,091 --> 00:15:42,221
Many people drink it.

460
00:15:42,851 --> 00:15:44,490
- Even the Indians? - Yes.

461
00:15:44,491 --> 00:15:45,860
(Lassi, an Indian yogurt drink that's flavored)

462
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,891
- What's this? - I always get mango-flavored.

463
00:15:49,761 --> 00:15:51,901
This is plain yogurt you can find at hotel breakfast.

464
00:15:52,031 --> 00:15:54,001
(Satisfied)

465
00:15:54,301 --> 00:15:56,000
(Dong Hyun takes a sip of mango lassi.)

466
00:15:56,001 --> 00:15:57,270
(It's so sour.)

467
00:15:57,271 --> 00:15:59,000
- This is nice. - Like that.

468
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,041
It's nice.

469
00:16:00,071 --> 00:16:02,210
- It smells like Yoplait. - Now...

470
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,211
(Team Thai Food is salivating.)

471
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:06,780
Would you like to play a game to win a sip through the straw?

472
00:16:06,781 --> 00:16:08,480
- That sounds good. - What do you think?

473
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:09,651
The second place in a round of rock-paper-scissors.

474
00:16:09,781 --> 00:16:11,550
- The 2nd place? - Only the 2nd place winner.

475
00:16:11,551 --> 00:16:13,580
Only the 2nd place? The 1st and the last can't get any?

476
00:16:13,581 --> 00:16:15,651
No, only the second place gets a sip.

477
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:17,451
Shall we play rock-paper-scissors?

478
00:16:17,452 --> 00:16:19,590
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - This is it.

479
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:21,291
(Scissors, scissors, rock)

480
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:23,061
- Yes. - He's saved.

481
00:16:23,731 --> 00:16:24,731
I have a chance.

482
00:16:25,231 --> 00:16:26,301
I have a chance.

483
00:16:26,801 --> 00:16:29,771
You have to win this round.

484
00:16:30,331 --> 00:16:32,071
How about psychological rock-paper-scissors?

485
00:16:32,201 --> 00:16:33,571
You have to say what you'll play beforehand.

486
00:16:34,141 --> 00:16:36,470
- I'll play paper. - That sounds good.

487
00:16:36,471 --> 00:16:37,640
You have to win. What will you play, Poong?

488
00:16:37,641 --> 00:16:38,781
I'll play scissors.

489
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:40,610
- He'll win. - I'll play what I said.

490
00:16:40,611 --> 00:16:42,280
- All right. - Will you play paper?

491
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:43,511
- Like this. - Your hand looks stiff.

492
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:44,751
Let me see if it bends.

493
00:16:44,752 --> 00:16:47,050
- It doesn't bend. - It doesn't bend.

494
00:16:47,051 --> 00:16:48,421
- It doesn't budge. - It's hard.

495
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:49,691
- It's totally stiff. - Okay.

496
00:16:50,251 --> 00:16:52,691
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

497
00:16:52,961 --> 00:16:54,061
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

498
00:16:56,991 --> 00:16:58,931
(Both of them betrayed each other.)

499
00:16:59,131 --> 00:17:01,731
You won. What was that about?

500
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:02,970
You won.

501
00:17:02,971 --> 00:17:04,771
(Poong won a sip of lassi.)

502
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:07,741
Sang Uk thought it once, and Poong thought it twice.

503
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:09,171
Twice?

504
00:17:10,871 --> 00:17:13,110
Which flavor would you like to try?

505
00:17:13,111 --> 00:17:14,780
- Don't you like mango? - Mango.

506
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:17,110
- There's more of it. - It's refreshing in the summer.

507
00:17:17,111 --> 00:17:19,420
- You just get one sip. - Here I go.

508
00:17:19,421 --> 00:17:20,921
- I'll take only 1 sip. - Just 1 sip.

509
00:17:22,451 --> 00:17:23,790
You already took a sip.

510
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,321
- No, wait. - You only get one.

511
00:17:26,491 --> 00:17:27,961
(Inhaling)

512
00:17:27,991 --> 00:17:29,061
(Exhaling)

513
00:17:29,161 --> 00:17:31,400
- No, wait. - You only get one.

514
00:17:31,401 --> 00:17:32,930
- I didn't even swallow it. - You already got one.

515
00:17:32,931 --> 00:17:34,631
- You already took a sip. - I didn't swallow it.

516
00:17:34,701 --> 00:17:37,130
- Here you go. - I said that you only get one sip.

517
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:38,870
- It's over. - You only get one sip.

518
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:40,740
Why did you do that?

519
00:17:40,741 --> 00:17:42,140
- Why did you do that? - Next.

520
00:17:42,141 --> 00:17:43,340
He wanted to exhale first...

521
00:17:43,341 --> 00:17:46,210
- before swallowing it. - My goodness.

522
00:17:46,211 --> 00:17:47,340
We said that you only get one sip.

523
00:17:47,341 --> 00:17:48,680
Why would you breathe with something in your mouth?

524
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:50,150
You must not be familiar with our rules.

525
00:17:50,151 --> 00:17:51,480
- They're precise. - Here we go again.

526
00:17:51,481 --> 00:17:52,580
- The loser. - The loser.

527
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:53,720
- One more time. - Let's do it again.

528
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:55,491
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

529
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:57,721
- Okay. - Goodness.

530
00:17:58,421 --> 00:17:59,920
- Congratulations to me. - Sang Uk is good.

531
00:17:59,921 --> 00:18:01,861
- He's really good. - Which flavor do you want?

532
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:03,260
That's plain.

533
00:18:03,261 --> 00:18:04,261
You only get one sip.

534
00:18:04,262 --> 00:18:05,561
(One sip of plain lassi)

535
00:18:05,861 --> 00:18:07,061
He got it.

536
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,500
- One sip. - That's all.

537
00:18:08,501 --> 00:18:09,601
You already took one sip.

538
00:18:09,771 --> 00:18:10,771
(One more sip)

539
00:18:10,772 --> 00:18:13,140
- What? Look at them. - Just drink it.

540
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:15,470
- Goodness. - He's drinking a lot.

541
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:17,211
I want more.

542
00:18:18,411 --> 00:18:19,641
My goodness.

543
00:18:20,511 --> 00:18:21,610
Oh, come on.

544
00:18:21,611 --> 00:18:23,451
How could he drink like that?

545
00:18:23,751 --> 00:18:25,450
- Listen. - He can't just drink like that.

546
00:18:25,451 --> 00:18:27,050
- He's a professional athlete. - Call the police.

547
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:29,020
- We have a gangster here. - It's delicious.

548
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:30,191
(Handsome Guys are causing trouble even before the food is served.)

549
00:18:31,051 --> 00:18:34,161
(Meanwhile, in the kitchen)

550
00:18:36,831 --> 00:18:38,931
(Chef, Mr. Kulvir Singh)

551
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:43,231
(Chef, Mr. Upendra Singh)

552
00:18:45,401 --> 00:18:47,571
(Chef, Mr. Daulat Singh)

553
00:18:49,811 --> 00:18:51,981
(Chef, Mr. Sohan Singh)

554
00:18:52,841 --> 00:18:56,381
(The group of chefs that leads this restaurant)

555
00:18:57,111 --> 00:18:58,280
(Fresh onions...)

556
00:18:58,281 --> 00:18:59,780
(and their masala made with a secret recipe)

557
00:18:59,781 --> 00:19:00,981
(Tomatoes are added.)

558
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:05,191
(Cooking the curry base)

559
00:19:08,831 --> 00:19:12,301
(By shaping flour dough into elongated pieces)

560
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:16,871
(Naan being baked in a tandoor)

561
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:20,301
(The secret to preserving the authentic Indian taste)

562
00:19:22,241 --> 00:19:25,341
(Coating it with butter generously)

563
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:28,851
(A classic combination that represents Indian food)

564
00:19:29,911 --> 00:19:31,250
(Indian curry and naan, not instant curry)

565
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:33,080
(Palak paneer, butter chicken, prawn makhani, )

566
00:19:33,081 --> 00:19:34,621
(chicken tikka masala, butter naan)

567
00:19:34,751 --> 00:19:36,651
I can't wait to try it.

568
00:19:37,391 --> 00:19:38,661
A lot of food is coming.

569
00:19:38,991 --> 00:19:41,860
- What's this? - I'll serve it with your curry.

570
00:19:41,861 --> 00:19:42,861
(Starting with curry and naan)

571
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:46,060
- It's butter chicken. Tikka masala. - What?

572
00:19:46,061 --> 00:19:48,171
- Is this curry? - Is this curry?

573
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:50,431
Is this how curry is served?

574
00:19:50,601 --> 00:19:52,171
The smell is so...

575
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,810
We'll eat it all.

576
00:19:54,811 --> 00:19:57,270
Is this naan?

577
00:19:57,271 --> 00:19:59,010
Naan looks like an elephant.

578
00:19:59,011 --> 00:20:00,011
This is garlic naan.

579
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:01,041
It looks exactly like an elephant.

580
00:20:01,481 --> 00:20:04,011
- Butter naan and onion naan. - This is butter.

581
00:20:04,151 --> 00:20:06,220
- Onion naan. - The onion naan has...

582
00:20:06,221 --> 00:20:08,520
minced onion and curry.

583
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:09,521
Let's try it by itself.

584
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:10,721
Go ahead and smell it.

585
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:12,891
- My gosh. - I promise to smell it only.

586
00:20:13,021 --> 00:20:15,161
If I do anything else, the food will be on me.

587
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:16,331
It smells like...

588
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,531
It smells so good.

589
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:22,500
(Tae Hyun takes a bite first.)

590
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:24,401
If I do anything else, the food will be on me.

591
00:20:24,871 --> 00:20:26,401
(Humming)

592
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,511
Zec crackers...

593
00:20:28,941 --> 00:20:30,110
Isn't it chewy?

594
00:20:30,111 --> 00:20:31,171
This is nice.

595
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:34,341
You can tell its chewy texture just by looking at it.

596
00:20:35,051 --> 00:20:36,651
(Kyung Soo tears the butter naan.)

597
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:39,751
- It looks excellent. - Look at the layers.

598
00:20:41,421 --> 00:20:42,951
(Look at the layers.)

599
00:20:43,421 --> 00:20:44,821
This is real pastry.

600
00:20:47,021 --> 00:20:48,861
It smells strong. Is this butter flavor?

601
00:20:49,861 --> 00:20:51,060
- Butter. - It smells greasy.

602
00:20:51,061 --> 00:20:52,230
Butter naan.

603
00:20:52,231 --> 00:20:53,431
Shall I try this one this time?

604
00:20:53,501 --> 00:20:56,871
(This time, they try it with curry.)

605
00:20:57,931 --> 00:21:00,140
(Chicken tikka masala, spicy curry made with a tomato...)

606
00:21:00,141 --> 00:21:02,271
(and cream-based masala with flame-grilled chicken)

607
00:21:03,841 --> 00:21:06,341
(He puts a lot of chicken tikka masala on top of naan.)

608
00:21:07,011 --> 00:21:08,310
- Do they have to mix it? - It's spinach.

609
00:21:08,311 --> 00:21:09,780
There's shrimp in it.

610
00:21:09,781 --> 00:21:10,781
Butter.

611
00:21:11,181 --> 00:21:12,750
- There's shrimp in it. - Is it delicious?

612
00:21:12,751 --> 00:21:13,851
(Humming in approval)

613
00:21:15,091 --> 00:21:17,121
- Is this how you eat it? - Like this?

614
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:19,190
Yes, that's it.

615
00:21:19,191 --> 00:21:20,560
- Do I eat it like this? - Exactly.

616
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:22,230
Fold it slightly like this.

617
00:21:22,231 --> 00:21:23,461
- Fold it? - Fold it slightly.

618
00:21:24,561 --> 00:21:26,661
(He folds the naan and fills his mouth with it.)

619
00:21:29,331 --> 00:21:31,070
(Making a dolphin sound)

620
00:21:31,071 --> 00:21:33,000
It's so delicious.

621
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,940
(Very satisfied)

622
00:21:34,941 --> 00:21:36,011
Butter curry?

623
00:21:36,841 --> 00:21:38,011
What's this one?

624
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,440
Tae Hyun, it tastes excellent.

625
00:21:39,441 --> 00:21:41,140
- Isn't it something chicken? - Is this chicken?

626
00:21:41,141 --> 00:21:42,150
It was the fifth curry.

627
00:21:42,151 --> 00:21:43,151
(Like Kyung Soo, Tae Hyun takes some chicken tikka masala.)

628
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,750
- Really? - It's a little spicy.

629
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:47,781
What is this called?

630
00:21:51,291 --> 00:21:52,361
Isn't it delicious, Tae Hyun?

631
00:21:52,921 --> 00:21:53,921
(Nodding)

632
00:21:54,321 --> 00:21:55,331
(Exclaiming)

633
00:21:55,491 --> 00:21:58,261
(He takes another bite immediately.)

634
00:21:58,461 --> 00:21:59,561
It will be useful.

635
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:01,361
(Licking)

636
00:22:01,431 --> 00:22:03,701
All of the naan look the same, but each one tastes different.

637
00:22:05,441 --> 00:22:06,600
(They can't stop eating curry and naan.)

638
00:22:06,601 --> 00:22:08,670
- I'm glad that we ordered... - The butter naan looks good.

639
00:22:08,671 --> 00:22:09,941
Several types of naan.

640
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,341
(Nodding)

641
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:15,381
(Naan with multiple layers)

642
00:22:18,381 --> 00:22:21,381
(An explosive flavor synergy when accompanied with curry)

643
00:22:27,821 --> 00:22:29,461
(Happy)

644
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,361
(Gulping)

645
00:22:31,431 --> 00:22:33,331
(Staring)

646
00:22:34,901 --> 00:22:36,401
(Sighing)

647
00:22:37,201 --> 00:22:40,201
Watching them eat makes us look ridiculous.

648
00:22:40,371 --> 00:22:41,641
This is...

649
00:22:41,941 --> 00:22:45,341
- I agree. - We're like the Little Match Girl.

650
00:22:45,441 --> 00:22:47,840
If I had matches, I'd be the Little Match Girl.

651
00:22:47,841 --> 00:22:48,880
Oh, no.

652
00:22:48,881 --> 00:22:50,851
(Team Thai Food is hungry.)

653
00:22:51,051 --> 00:22:54,680
After eating three sets of curry that's brown or orange,

654
00:22:54,681 --> 00:22:56,191
when you eat palak paneer,

655
00:22:56,491 --> 00:22:58,391
- you'll be very surprised. - The third one?

656
00:22:58,661 --> 00:23:00,960
Kyung Soo is going for some palak paneer.

657
00:23:00,961 --> 00:23:01,990
The green one?

658
00:23:01,991 --> 00:23:03,060
Is it cheese on top?

659
00:23:03,061 --> 00:23:04,261
Yes, it's cheese.

660
00:23:04,361 --> 00:23:05,460
(What could it be?)

661
00:23:05,461 --> 00:23:07,601
- They're eating well and neatly. - It's so delicious.

662
00:23:08,871 --> 00:23:11,501
(Beyond the mysterious shades)

663
00:23:12,371 --> 00:23:14,100
(With spinach and handmade Indian cheese, )

664
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,471
(the curry boasts a deep flavor of the vegetable.)

665
00:23:17,971 --> 00:23:21,411
(Palak paneer, a meeting of spinach, cheese, and spices)

666
00:23:23,751 --> 00:23:25,481
Is this the butter one? Be careful.

667
00:23:25,851 --> 00:23:27,981
(He dropped some curry on his pants.)

668
00:23:28,151 --> 00:23:29,450
You dropped it on your pants.

669
00:23:29,451 --> 00:23:30,490
(Eating it with his finger)

670
00:23:30,491 --> 00:23:31,791
- Please use this. - Thank you.

671
00:23:32,021 --> 00:23:33,221
It's delicious.

672
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:35,391
Palak paneer is amazing.

673
00:23:35,761 --> 00:23:37,391
Did someone eat what was on his pants?

674
00:23:37,531 --> 00:23:39,561
Yes, the chef did.

675
00:23:40,031 --> 00:23:41,430
I told you that I'm not a chef.

676
00:23:41,431 --> 00:23:43,670
Don't call me a chef from now on.

677
00:23:43,671 --> 00:23:45,771
- Mr. Writer. - Just call me a writer.

678
00:23:46,101 --> 00:23:48,910
- Here's your tandoori chicken. - Tandoori.

679
00:23:48,911 --> 00:23:50,110
(Now it's time for meat.)

680
00:23:50,111 --> 00:23:52,111
Please have the thigh.

681
00:23:53,311 --> 00:23:54,380
(Glancing)

682
00:23:54,381 --> 00:23:55,610
What is it?

683
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:56,880
- What? - Gosh.

684
00:23:56,881 --> 00:24:00,180
Just take a look.

685
00:24:00,181 --> 00:24:02,691
(He got tricked.)

686
00:24:02,821 --> 00:24:03,951
We just met today.

687
00:24:04,491 --> 00:24:05,661
Aren't you being rude?

688
00:24:05,791 --> 00:24:07,120
I thought that he was giving it to you.

689
00:24:07,121 --> 00:24:10,491
Why you... You're being so harsh.

690
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:11,761
By the way...

691
00:24:12,601 --> 00:24:14,661
Here are the lamb chops you ordered.

692
00:24:14,831 --> 00:24:16,530
Please put the lamb over here.

693
00:24:16,531 --> 00:24:17,570
(The lamb chop tandoori finally appeared.)

694
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:18,901
The lamb chops look amazing.

695
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:20,701
(Upset)

696
00:24:20,841 --> 00:24:23,411
- Please have the leg. - Gosh, it's hot.

697
00:24:24,141 --> 00:24:25,940
It's hot.

698
00:24:25,941 --> 00:24:27,111
The bone is hot.

699
00:24:27,511 --> 00:24:28,651
Please have the leg.

700
00:24:32,021 --> 00:24:33,680
(Tandoori refers to anything cooked...)

701
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,490
(in a traditional Indian oven called a tandoor.)

702
00:24:35,491 --> 00:24:37,220
(Covered with spices, the lamb chops are juicy and flavorful.)

703
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:38,961
- It's perfect. - My goodness.

704
00:24:40,891 --> 00:24:42,390
(Dong Hyun dips the lamb chop...)

705
00:24:42,391 --> 00:24:43,691
(in the cilantro masala.)

706
00:24:43,991 --> 00:24:45,000
(Humming)

707
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:46,001
This is good.

708
00:24:47,501 --> 00:24:48,730
There's cilantro in it.

709
00:24:48,731 --> 00:24:50,030
- Cilantro? - I love cilantro.

710
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:51,331
I'm a huge fan of cilantro.

711
00:24:52,071 --> 00:24:53,901
- Would you like to smell it? - Yes.

712
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:55,071
It smells like cilantro.

713
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:57,111
You're good at teasing them.

714
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:58,541
It smells really good.

715
00:24:59,011 --> 00:25:00,011
Here you go.

716
00:25:00,012 --> 00:25:01,711
(They dip their fingers secretly in it.)

717
00:25:05,751 --> 00:25:06,821
Are you okay?

718
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:08,991
You're my soda pop

719
00:25:10,951 --> 00:25:12,461
You're my soda pop

720
00:25:13,321 --> 00:25:15,060
(A sudden roar of a lion echoes in the air)

721
00:25:15,061 --> 00:25:17,160
- What is it? - It just crossed my mind.

722
00:25:17,161 --> 00:25:18,161
What are you doing all of a sudden?

723
00:25:18,162 --> 00:25:20,231
I met Poong for the first time today.

724
00:25:20,461 --> 00:25:21,631
He makes me feel very uncomfortable.

725
00:25:22,131 --> 00:25:23,200
I mean,

726
00:25:23,201 --> 00:25:26,270
you licked your pinkie right in front of me.

727
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:27,371
(Rascal Seung Ho is shocked.)

728
00:25:28,141 --> 00:25:30,211
(Embarrassed)

729
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:32,280
(Laughing)

730
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,611
It's delicious.

731
00:25:34,481 --> 00:25:35,510
- All right. - Yes?

732
00:25:35,511 --> 00:25:36,781
What would you like to try?

733
00:25:37,111 --> 00:25:39,120
I'd like this...

734
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,620
with some curry.

735
00:25:40,621 --> 00:25:42,821
On top of some naan,

736
00:25:43,091 --> 00:25:44,290
we'll put the curry of your choice.

737
00:25:44,291 --> 00:25:45,761
Okay, good.

738
00:25:46,591 --> 00:25:47,720
We'll give a nonsense quiz.

739
00:25:47,721 --> 00:25:48,830
- The winner gets to eat. - Nonsense?

740
00:25:48,831 --> 00:25:50,561
- Is it a nonsense quiz? - Nonsense.

741
00:25:50,861 --> 00:25:52,801
- All right. In soccer... - Yes.

742
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,430
Lee Chung Yong...

743
00:25:54,431 --> 00:25:56,331
and Ki Sung Yueng.

744
00:25:57,401 --> 00:25:59,901
There's one Yong who connects both of them.

745
00:26:01,271 --> 00:26:02,310
Which Yong is it?

746
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:03,570
(Yong that connects Lee Chung Yong and Ki Sung Yueng)

747
00:26:03,571 --> 00:26:05,340
That's so easy. Ki Sung Yueng and who else?

748
00:26:05,341 --> 00:26:06,680
- Lee Chung Yong. - Connecting Lee Chung Yong...

749
00:26:06,681 --> 00:26:07,811
I got it.

750
00:26:09,211 --> 00:26:10,311
Lee Eul Yong.

751
00:26:10,511 --> 00:26:12,121
Why did you say the answer?

752
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:14,050
Why would you tell them the answer?

753
00:26:14,051 --> 00:26:15,350
Wasn't that the question?

754
00:26:15,351 --> 00:26:17,221
You said, "Connecting Lee Chung Yong."

755
00:26:17,351 --> 00:26:18,520
Yong who connects them.

756
00:26:18,521 --> 00:26:19,690
Lee Eul Yong?

757
00:26:19,691 --> 00:26:20,720
(Poong missed it right in front of him.)

758
00:26:20,721 --> 00:26:21,791
Isn't this funny?

759
00:26:22,091 --> 00:26:23,761
I can't think clearly because I'm starving.

760
00:26:24,191 --> 00:26:25,631
(Sad)

761
00:26:26,101 --> 00:26:27,630
Did you come up with it?

762
00:26:27,631 --> 00:26:28,631
I thought of it a long time ago.
(Lamb chop)

763
00:26:29,632 --> 00:26:30,731
You can't take that.

764
00:26:31,071 --> 00:26:32,740
- Wait a minute. - Isn't this leftover?

765
00:26:32,741 --> 00:26:33,871
You think that's lettuce?

766
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:36,270
- It's your leftover food. - Goodness.

767
00:26:36,271 --> 00:26:38,070
- You can't do that. - I thought that it was lettuce.

768
00:26:38,071 --> 00:26:39,180
I thought that he was wrapping it in lettuce.

769
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:40,240
Is that your choice?

770
00:26:40,241 --> 00:26:41,441
- Is that your pick? - Yes.

771
00:26:41,781 --> 00:26:43,651
That must be really delicious.

772
00:26:44,251 --> 00:26:45,381
It must be your favorite.

773
00:26:45,551 --> 00:26:46,720
He's liked it for a while.

774
00:26:46,721 --> 00:26:48,851
Add some red ones too. The red one is much better.

775
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,590
How many are you adding?

776
00:26:50,591 --> 00:26:52,461
- Isn't this much... - The naan is big.

777
00:26:52,591 --> 00:26:55,790
You're giving me many orders. I'll carry them out.

778
00:26:55,791 --> 00:26:56,961
That's it, Seung Ho.

779
00:26:57,031 --> 00:26:58,191
- This one? - Yes.

780
00:26:58,731 --> 00:27:01,260
(Seung Ho is making a set of 4 curry.)

781
00:27:01,261 --> 00:27:02,571
After his one-week break,

782
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:04,971
he's gotten more frightening.

783
00:27:05,171 --> 00:27:07,441
(Our Rascal Seung Ho)

784
00:27:08,771 --> 00:27:10,610
(He folds it carefully...)

785
00:27:10,611 --> 00:27:12,281
(and takes a big bite.)

786
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:17,951
(Making a face with happiness)

787
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:21,020
(Jealous)

788
00:27:21,021 --> 00:27:22,121
You know what's clear?

789
00:27:22,751 --> 00:27:24,250
The oldest ones are bad at quizzes.

790
00:27:24,251 --> 00:27:25,321
They're terrible.

791
00:27:25,761 --> 00:27:26,790
It's hard for us.

792
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:28,931
Nonsense quizzes today are different from what we're used to.

793
00:27:29,031 --> 00:27:30,930
I'll give you one that's more advantageous for you.

794
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:31,931
That sounds good.

795
00:27:31,932 --> 00:27:33,401
Here's one that's advantageous for Poong.

796
00:27:33,901 --> 00:27:35,601
This could be very easy.

797
00:27:36,131 --> 00:27:37,330
You have to know about Egypt.

798
00:27:37,331 --> 00:27:38,571
Know about Egypt?

799
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:41,300
I have no idea about this one.

800
00:27:41,301 --> 00:27:42,571
(Does it require a lot of common knowledge?)

801
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:46,511
What do they say in Egypt on their way to work?

802
00:27:46,681 --> 00:27:47,740
In Egypt.

803
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:48,810
- Egypt? - Yes.

804
00:27:48,811 --> 00:27:50,211
- What they say... - On their way to work?

805
00:27:50,811 --> 00:27:52,250
I got it. "As salamu alaykum."

806
00:27:52,251 --> 00:27:54,450
(Answer: As salamu alaykum)

807
00:27:54,451 --> 00:27:55,620
- Incorrect. - Is it wrong?

808
00:27:55,621 --> 00:27:56,750
What could be the answer?

809
00:27:56,751 --> 00:27:58,960
(This is a nonsense quiz.)

810
00:27:58,961 --> 00:28:00,790
- On their way to work? - They say it on their way to work?

811
00:28:00,791 --> 00:28:01,860
This one is very...

812
00:28:01,861 --> 00:28:02,930
- It's something you know. - I got it.

813
00:28:02,931 --> 00:28:04,231
- On their way to work. - Pharaoh.

814
00:28:04,291 --> 00:28:05,900
Pharaoh? Why is that?

815
00:28:05,901 --> 00:28:07,300
- That's similar. - On their way to work.

816
00:28:07,301 --> 00:28:08,331
On their way to work...

817
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:10,071
"Pharaoh."

818
00:28:11,171 --> 00:28:12,970
- Why? - I don't know.

819
00:28:12,971 --> 00:28:14,200
I'm sorry.

820
00:28:14,201 --> 00:28:15,670
- You're... - I have no idea.

821
00:28:15,671 --> 00:28:17,010
- on the right track. - Really?

822
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:18,011
You're on the right track.

823
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:19,411
- Really? - It's something similar.

824
00:28:19,981 --> 00:28:22,411
- It's said with an adorable tone. - Yes.

825
00:28:23,651 --> 00:28:24,781
I see.

826
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:26,550
- With an adorable tone. - With an adorable tone.

827
00:28:26,551 --> 00:28:28,021
- I don't know much about Egypt. - Egypt...

828
00:28:29,121 --> 00:28:30,151
I got it.

829
00:28:30,721 --> 00:28:31,861
"Tutankhamun."

830
00:28:33,521 --> 00:28:34,661
"Tutankhamun."

831
00:28:36,761 --> 00:28:37,890
What is it?

832
00:28:37,891 --> 00:28:38,900
Seriously.

833
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:40,400
- You're very close. - Is it something like this?

834
00:28:40,401 --> 00:28:41,460
- You're very close. - It's something like that.

835
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:42,470
- Is it? - Imagine more.

836
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:44,071
- You're on your way to work. - You're very close.

837
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:46,040
- You're on your way to work. - "Imhotep?"

838
00:28:46,041 --> 00:28:47,170
- Imhotep. - Imhotep?

839
00:28:47,171 --> 00:28:48,640
- Incorrect. - Goodness.

840
00:28:48,641 --> 00:28:49,840
- You're really close. - What?

841
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:50,870
Wait a minute.

842
00:28:50,871 --> 00:28:52,140
- Oh, my. - What is it?

843
00:28:52,141 --> 00:28:53,511
- I have no idea. - Imagine everything.

844
00:28:54,081 --> 00:28:55,380
Oscillious.

845
00:28:55,381 --> 00:28:56,680
- "Oscillious?" - Is that related to Egypt?

846
00:28:56,681 --> 00:28:57,751
What are you saying? It's incorrect.

847
00:28:57,981 --> 00:28:59,680
"I am..." That's part of the answer.

848
00:28:59,681 --> 00:29:00,851
- "I am..." - "I am..."

849
00:29:01,351 --> 00:29:02,550
I'll be back?

850
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:03,891
- I... - It's something like that.

851
00:29:04,151 --> 00:29:06,021
- I'm Cleopatra. - "I'm Cleopatra?"

852
00:29:06,961 --> 00:29:08,530
(The writer is different.)

853
00:29:08,531 --> 00:29:10,560
- That's understandable. - What is it, seriously?

854
00:29:10,561 --> 00:29:12,600
(Let's take a look at the answer by now.)

855
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:13,661
My goodness.

856
00:29:13,831 --> 00:29:15,900
(What do they say in Egypt on their way to work?)

857
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:19,071
(Answer: The Nile)

858
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:22,010
Let's say that you're going out.

859
00:29:22,011 --> 00:29:23,510
When your wife asks you where you're going, what do you say?

860
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:25,241
- Yes, that's good. - Yes.

861
00:29:25,611 --> 00:29:27,010
- On his way to work? - Where am I going?

862
00:29:27,011 --> 00:29:28,141
- Where am I going? - Yes.

863
00:29:28,181 --> 00:29:29,510
That's right. What do you tell her?

864
00:29:29,511 --> 00:29:30,511
In that case...

865
00:29:30,512 --> 00:29:31,611
- Where are you going? - Me?

866
00:29:32,751 --> 00:29:34,621
I'm going to work.

867
00:29:35,051 --> 00:29:37,090
I'm going to work...

868
00:29:37,091 --> 00:29:38,150
"I'm going to work."

869
00:29:38,151 --> 00:29:39,660
- "I'm going to work." - Iraq.

870
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:40,721
No, it can't be Iraq.

871
00:29:42,461 --> 00:29:44,660
(Right in front of the answer)

872
00:29:44,661 --> 00:29:46,600
Iraq is right next to Egypt anyway. Wait a minute.

873
00:29:46,601 --> 00:29:48,300
- I'm going to work. - It can't be Iraq.

874
00:29:48,301 --> 00:29:50,101
- I'm going to work. - Make it very short.

875
00:29:50,271 --> 00:29:52,341
I'm going to work.

876
00:29:52,941 --> 00:29:54,341
I'm going to work.

877
00:29:54,701 --> 00:29:55,940
- What is this? - Make it faster.

878
00:29:55,941 --> 00:29:57,971
I'm going to work?

879
00:29:58,111 --> 00:30:00,641
- I'm going to work? - Make it shorter.

880
00:30:00,711 --> 00:30:01,711
I don't want any food.

881
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:02,780
- I got it. - I have no idea.

882
00:30:02,781 --> 00:30:03,851
Seung Ho, what's your answer?

883
00:30:05,111 --> 00:30:06,221
Did you go to work?

884
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:07,551
The Nile?

885
00:30:08,221 --> 00:30:09,251
Correct.

886
00:30:10,091 --> 00:30:12,290
- "The Nile?" - The Nile.

887
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:13,591
(Mr. Poong's head is down again.)

888
00:30:13,691 --> 00:30:16,290
(Seung Ho gets another chance to freeload.)

889
00:30:16,291 --> 00:30:18,161
What was "I'm Cleopatra" about?

890
00:30:19,261 --> 00:30:20,560
You know many Egyptian words.

891
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:22,130
I don't know which language it is.

892
00:30:22,131 --> 00:30:24,031
(Poong failed to taste the curry until the end.)

893
00:30:26,201 --> 00:30:27,301
The bill is here.

894
00:30:27,471 --> 00:30:28,871
- I bet it's quite expensive. - Thank you.

895
00:30:30,171 --> 00:30:31,511
It's 178 dollars.

896
00:30:32,041 --> 00:30:33,041
It's much less than...

897
00:30:33,042 --> 00:30:34,940
- For all this? - We had a lot of food.

898
00:30:34,941 --> 00:30:36,181
We ate until we were stuffed.

899
00:30:36,711 --> 00:30:38,150
All right.

900
00:30:38,151 --> 00:30:39,850
- Kyung Soo is here with us. - We need to submit it.

901
00:30:39,851 --> 00:30:41,251
Let's submit our card.

902
00:30:41,921 --> 00:30:42,921
Kyung Soo.

903
00:30:42,922 --> 00:30:44,250
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

904
00:30:44,251 --> 00:30:45,391
Here's the question.

905
00:30:45,791 --> 00:30:47,260
India is known...

906
00:30:47,261 --> 00:30:48,760
for its high enthusiasm for education.

907
00:30:48,761 --> 00:30:50,060
- Enthusiasm for education? - Enthusiasm for education?

908
00:30:50,061 --> 00:30:51,061
Yes.

909
00:30:51,062 --> 00:30:53,830
This photo shows parents and relatives of students...

910
00:30:53,831 --> 00:30:56,430
climbing the wall of an exam center on the day...

911
00:30:56,431 --> 00:30:59,740
- of the high school entrance exam. - Seriously?

912
00:30:59,741 --> 00:31:01,171
That's intense. Is this necessary?

913
00:31:02,111 --> 00:31:04,370
Why are they climbing the wall?

914
00:31:04,371 --> 00:31:05,381
What?

915
00:31:06,081 --> 00:31:07,280
While the students are taking an exam,

916
00:31:07,281 --> 00:31:08,580
- they're on the wall like this? - Yes.

917
00:31:08,581 --> 00:31:10,151
- Is this outside the classrooms? - Yes.

918
00:31:10,551 --> 00:31:11,980
That's not allowed.

919
00:31:11,981 --> 00:31:14,081
Right. Usually, this isn't allowed.

920
00:31:14,281 --> 00:31:16,121
What are they doing?

921
00:31:17,151 --> 00:31:19,091
I think it's to tell them the answers.

922
00:31:19,521 --> 00:31:20,991
The hint is their enthusiasm for education.

923
00:31:22,031 --> 00:31:23,891
If they tell them the answers, everyone would hear them.

924
00:31:24,331 --> 00:31:26,030
This is ridiculous.

925
00:31:26,031 --> 00:31:28,461
The answer isn't obvious at all.

926
00:31:28,671 --> 00:31:29,831
There are ropes.

927
00:31:30,171 --> 00:31:32,170
They climb the wall by hanging onto the rope.

928
00:31:32,171 --> 00:31:33,571
(Ropes)

929
00:31:34,341 --> 00:31:35,911
Is it to put taffy on the windows?

930
00:31:37,641 --> 00:31:38,940
- I thought... - Giving them the answers...

931
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:40,241
- that they were cheering for them. - Cheering?

932
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:43,081
I also thought that they were reprimanding their children.

933
00:31:43,751 --> 00:31:44,911
To tell them to behave.

934
00:31:45,751 --> 00:31:47,681
"You're the hope of our family."

935
00:31:47,881 --> 00:31:49,621
- If they're dozing off, "wake up!" - Get up.

936
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:52,261
"Do you want to repeat another year?"

937
00:31:54,461 --> 00:31:56,190
"Come to your senses."

938
00:31:56,191 --> 00:31:57,431
(While Seung Ho is still freeloading)

939
00:31:58,331 --> 00:32:00,660
Some people in the photo are...

940
00:32:00,661 --> 00:32:02,671
- They're giving something. - doing something.

941
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:03,900
- Look. - I see.

942
00:32:03,901 --> 00:32:05,840
- They're doing something. - Or they're giving something.

943
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:08,041
Someone is doing something with his hand in his pocket.

944
00:32:08,341 --> 00:32:11,311
His arm is completely inside the window.

945
00:32:12,041 --> 00:32:13,310
They're doing something.

946
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:14,541
(It's definitely suspicious.)

947
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,411
It takes a long time to take an exam.

948
00:32:17,911 --> 00:32:19,781
Are they giving them lunch?

949
00:32:19,981 --> 00:32:22,651
- With some naan? - Yes, exactly.

950
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:23,821
Tae Hyun.

951
00:32:23,891 --> 00:32:27,020
Based on what you said, I found a hint.

952
00:32:27,021 --> 00:32:28,221
- If what you say is correct. - Okay.

953
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:31,930
- Are they giving something? - Lunch boxes are on the floor.

954
00:32:31,931 --> 00:32:33,301
(Things that look like lunch boxes are on the floor.)

955
00:32:33,761 --> 00:32:35,100
- Right? - It could be food.

956
00:32:35,101 --> 00:32:36,971
Why is this the only place with these like bricks?

957
00:32:37,301 --> 00:32:38,301
- Let's see. - Take a look.

958
00:32:38,302 --> 00:32:39,541
- That must be it. - Right?

959
00:32:39,801 --> 00:32:41,241
- Why would bricks be there only? - That must be it.

960
00:32:41,371 --> 00:32:43,440
- We can go with giving food. - Shall we?

961
00:32:43,441 --> 00:32:44,870
- Shall we go with that? - Yes.

962
00:32:44,871 --> 00:32:46,081
- Let's go with that. - That...

963
00:32:46,141 --> 00:32:47,580
- That's our only choice. - Is this correct?

964
00:32:47,581 --> 00:32:49,111
- It's the most reasonable. - Even if we get it wrong...

965
00:32:49,311 --> 00:32:50,411
- We got it. - Yes?

966
00:32:50,911 --> 00:32:52,821
To give them food.

967
00:32:54,081 --> 00:32:57,491
They climbed the wall to give them food?

968
00:32:58,051 --> 00:32:59,560
"The answer is incorrect."

969
00:32:59,561 --> 00:33:00,960
(If it's correct, Team Thai Food will pay.)

970
00:33:00,961 --> 00:33:02,131
- It's not easy. - The answer is...

971
00:33:02,291 --> 00:33:03,360
- What? - It's incorrect.

972
00:33:03,361 --> 00:33:04,361
- What? - Goodness.

973
00:33:04,661 --> 00:33:05,900
Don't do that.

974
00:33:05,901 --> 00:33:08,261
Don't try to fool us.

975
00:33:08,931 --> 00:33:09,931
It's incorrect.

976
00:33:09,932 --> 00:33:11,331
It's an open class.

977
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:12,500
Is it incorrect?

978
00:33:12,501 --> 00:33:13,501
Goodness.

979
00:33:13,801 --> 00:33:16,641
Since they're highly enthusiastic about education,

980
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:18,740
I thought that they were giving cheat sheets.

981
00:33:18,741 --> 00:33:20,240
(Answer: To give cheat sheets)

982
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:21,281
Correct.

983
00:33:22,011 --> 00:33:23,251
It's correct.

984
00:33:24,351 --> 00:33:25,450
(Dong Hyun is exempt from paying.)

985
00:33:25,451 --> 00:33:27,451
- I almost said that answer. - Seriously?

986
00:33:27,521 --> 00:33:29,490
This photo shows people climbing the five-story building...

987
00:33:29,491 --> 00:33:32,120
of an exam center on the day of the high school entrance exam.

988
00:33:32,121 --> 00:33:34,090
During the 2-day exam period, 515 students...

989
00:33:34,091 --> 00:33:37,461
were disqualified for cheating.

990
00:33:37,661 --> 00:33:39,100
Dong Hyun, take back your card.

991
00:33:39,101 --> 00:33:41,500
I will. I'm sorry about this.

992
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:42,930
- It's an individual game now. - Individual game.

993
00:33:42,931 --> 00:33:44,000
(Now, it's an individual game.)

994
00:33:44,001 --> 00:33:45,070
It's an individual game.

995
00:33:45,071 --> 00:33:46,900
(The final Who'll Pay Quiz)

996
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:48,370
Among the three of you,

997
00:33:48,371 --> 00:33:51,140
the two to guess A and B in the famous quote...

998
00:33:51,141 --> 00:33:52,880
will be exempt from paying.

999
00:33:52,881 --> 00:33:55,411
"A person begins with a smile..."

1000
00:33:55,611 --> 00:33:56,951
Begins with a smile.

1001
00:33:57,081 --> 00:34:00,250
"Grows with A."

1002
00:34:00,251 --> 00:34:02,451
"And ends with B."

1003
00:34:02,621 --> 00:34:03,750
- Can I guess one of them? - Yes.

1004
00:34:03,751 --> 00:34:05,460
I got it. Can I guess B?

1005
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:06,991
- It doesn't matter. Just answer it. - Smile.

1006
00:34:07,491 --> 00:34:08,660
It started with smile.

1007
00:34:08,661 --> 00:34:10,230
- "A person begins with a smile." - He begins with a smile...

1008
00:34:10,231 --> 00:34:11,731
and ends with a smile.

1009
00:34:12,161 --> 00:34:13,761
(Could it be correct?)

1010
00:34:13,901 --> 00:34:15,201
- That's a new approach. - Is it correct?

1011
00:34:15,701 --> 00:34:16,701
Incorrect.

1012
00:34:16,702 --> 00:34:19,640
It sounded so reasonable.

1013
00:34:19,641 --> 00:34:22,741
His low voice totally duped me.

1014
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:25,711
(Disappointed)

1015
00:34:26,081 --> 00:34:27,980
- A, tears. - A, tears?

1016
00:34:27,981 --> 00:34:29,650
(A person begins with a smile, grows with tears.)

1017
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:30,750
- Incorrect. - Oh, my.

1018
00:34:30,751 --> 00:34:32,651
- I got it. B, tears. - B, tears?

1019
00:34:34,751 --> 00:34:36,151
- That is correct. - Nice!

1020
00:34:36,221 --> 00:34:37,451
I should've said that sooner.

1021
00:34:37,751 --> 00:34:39,321
Nice. Tae Hyun, come on.

1022
00:34:39,561 --> 00:34:40,660
Of course, it ends with tears.

1023
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,390
How can love make you cry more?

1024
00:34:42,391 --> 00:34:43,830
Relationships evolve...

1025
00:34:43,831 --> 00:34:45,560
through the tears we shed.

1026
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:47,400
You know how it is.

1027
00:34:47,401 --> 00:34:48,660
Love makes you cry.

1028
00:34:48,661 --> 00:34:49,700
Figure out the rest.

1029
00:34:49,701 --> 00:34:51,501
- A, consideration. - Consideration?

1030
00:34:51,871 --> 00:34:52,900
Incorrect.

1031
00:34:52,901 --> 00:34:54,571
Love grows with love.

1032
00:34:54,671 --> 00:34:55,710
Incorrect.

1033
00:34:55,711 --> 00:34:57,741
- Another person. - Another person? Incorrect.

1034
00:34:58,341 --> 00:35:00,841
(Just then)

1035
00:35:01,281 --> 00:35:02,350
Kyung Soo.

1036
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,211
- Try, "kiss." - What?

1037
00:35:04,381 --> 00:35:06,450
(Rascal Seung Ho's sudden flirting)

1038
00:35:06,451 --> 00:35:08,080
- I'll answer. Kissing. - Kissing?

1039
00:35:08,081 --> 00:35:09,191
Correct.

1040
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:11,991
(That's correct?)

1041
00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:13,491
Kissing? Correct.

1042
00:35:13,492 --> 00:35:17,061
(Startled)

1043
00:35:18,191 --> 00:35:20,060
- Seriously? - Is that really correct?

1044
00:35:20,061 --> 00:35:21,100
That is correct.

1045
00:35:21,101 --> 00:35:23,031
(Thanks to Rascal Seung Ho, Kyung Soo is exempt from paying.)

1046
00:35:23,101 --> 00:35:25,430
- The eldest has to buy again. - Unbelievable.

1047
00:35:25,431 --> 00:35:27,770
- He's been paying a lot lately. - Even until the last day.

1048
00:35:27,771 --> 00:35:28,801
(Tae Hyun pays for the Indian food!)

1049
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:32,070
- We enjoyed the food. - Thank you.

1050
00:35:32,071 --> 00:35:33,911
- It was a great meal. - Thank you.

1051
00:35:33,941 --> 00:35:35,011
That was amazing.

1052
00:35:35,041 --> 00:35:36,681
- Thank you. - We'll get going.

1053
00:35:36,711 --> 00:35:38,251
- This way. - Let's go.

1054
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:40,381
It's summer now.

1055
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,921
- It's really hot. - Do you like the summer?

1056
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:44,551
Is it summer over winter?

1057
00:35:44,591 --> 00:35:45,691
I love winter more.

1058
00:35:46,161 --> 00:35:47,660
- I prefer summer. - Really?

1059
00:35:47,661 --> 00:35:49,391
- I can't handle the heat. - In my case,

1060
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:51,091
I can't handle the cold.

1061
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:52,960
Kyung Soo, what about you? Do you prefer summer?

1062
00:35:52,961 --> 00:35:56,700
My preference changed after going through this summer and the last.

1063
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:57,701
I prefer winter now.

1064
00:35:58,171 --> 00:35:59,240
You must've had a hard time.

1065
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,541
The weather was too humid.

1066
00:36:00,801 --> 00:36:02,640
You can bundle up in the cold,

1067
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:04,610
but you can't strip off your skin in the heat.

1068
00:36:04,611 --> 00:36:05,641
(Discussing their preferred season as they walk)

1069
00:36:06,011 --> 00:36:07,610
- Is this the place? - This must be it.

1070
00:36:07,611 --> 00:36:09,650
- Is this it? - The Thai restaurant.

1071
00:36:09,651 --> 00:36:10,910
The Thai restaurant.

1072
00:36:10,911 --> 00:36:12,421
(They soon arrive at the second restaurant for lunch.)

1073
00:36:12,681 --> 00:36:14,921
The chef here also cooked at a five-star hotel.

1074
00:36:15,051 --> 00:36:17,551
- He's a local chef too. - The food looks great.

1075
00:36:17,751 --> 00:36:19,560
- It smells like Thailand. - I can already smell it.

1076
00:36:19,561 --> 00:36:20,790
Exactly, like Thailand.

1077
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:23,761
(Welcome to Thailand.)

1078
00:36:24,531 --> 00:36:28,501
(Under the command of a chef from a 5-star hotel in Thailand)

1079
00:36:29,001 --> 00:36:34,001
(The restaurant serves authentic Thai food.)

1080
00:36:34,541 --> 00:36:36,240
(Although it's tucked away in an alley, )

1081
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:37,911
(it's always bustling with customers.)

1082
00:36:38,711 --> 00:36:43,111
(Lunch Menu Recommendation 2, Thai food)

1083
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,620
(Before ordering the food, Poong hands out cups of water.)

1084
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:46,780
We're fine.

1085
00:36:46,781 --> 00:36:48,351
Don't you want any water? It's just water.

1086
00:36:48,951 --> 00:36:51,121
- Can we get a zero-sugar beverage? - What?

1087
00:36:51,191 --> 00:36:52,321
- Zero-sugar? - Right?

1088
00:36:53,121 --> 00:36:55,861
Dong Hyun wants us to order a zero-sugar beverage.

1089
00:36:55,991 --> 00:36:57,060
- Really? - A zero-sugar beverage?

1090
00:36:57,061 --> 00:36:58,261
- Isn't that okay? - Well...

1091
00:36:58,331 --> 00:36:59,331
Zero as in the number.

1092
00:36:59,332 --> 00:37:01,300
- Get him zero beverages. - I see.

1093
00:37:01,301 --> 00:37:02,330
- So that's what he meant. - Zero as in none.

1094
00:37:02,331 --> 00:37:04,130
I didn't know and was flustered just now.

1095
00:37:04,131 --> 00:37:05,601
(It's time for revenge.)

1096
00:37:06,541 --> 00:37:07,600
Let's see.

1097
00:37:07,601 --> 00:37:08,601
(Waiting to look up the dishes)

1098
00:37:08,602 --> 00:37:09,840
(After putting a stop to Dong Hyun, they look at the menu.)

1099
00:37:09,841 --> 00:37:10,940
Let's take a look.

1100
00:37:10,941 --> 00:37:13,310
Have you tried tom yum kung?

1101
00:37:13,311 --> 00:37:15,010
Of course. Haven't you tried it?

1102
00:37:15,011 --> 00:37:16,081
- I haven't? - Really?

1103
00:37:16,211 --> 00:37:17,710
You should try it.

1104
00:37:17,711 --> 00:37:19,250
- You haven't had it before? - No.

1105
00:37:19,251 --> 00:37:20,550
You should try tom yum kung.

1106
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:22,951
I know nothing about Thai food.

1107
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:25,421
Moo sam chan tod.

1108
00:37:25,491 --> 00:37:26,920
How do you even read this?

1109
00:37:26,921 --> 00:37:29,190
Let's order one moo sam chan tod.

1110
00:37:29,191 --> 00:37:30,391
Moo sam chan tod.

1111
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,731
I'm an expert in Thai cuisine.

1112
00:37:33,461 --> 00:37:36,700
This Thai-style fried egg dish is good,

1113
00:37:36,701 --> 00:37:38,301
- but not many people know it. - Khai jiao?

1114
00:37:39,101 --> 00:37:41,170
- Okay, we'll order. - This is a challenge.

1115
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:42,870
One poo pad pong karee,

1116
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:44,541
one moo sam chan tod,

1117
00:37:44,611 --> 00:37:46,241
one khai jiao,

1118
00:37:47,141 --> 00:37:48,341
one stir-fried morning glory,

1119
00:37:48,541 --> 00:37:50,410
one tom yum kung, and...

1120
00:37:50,411 --> 00:37:51,810
- Sure. - The one with noodles, please.

1121
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,080
Tom yum kung pho and...

1122
00:37:53,081 --> 00:37:54,850
As for beverages,

1123
00:37:54,851 --> 00:37:56,251
- we'll have zero-sugar coke. - Yes, zero-sugar coke.

1124
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:58,190
- Three glasses? - Yes.

1125
00:37:58,191 --> 00:37:59,661
- Yes, three. Thank you. - Three.

1126
00:38:00,121 --> 00:38:01,290
(Shortly, the first dish is served.)

1127
00:38:01,291 --> 00:38:03,190
- Thank you. - Is this poo...

1128
00:38:03,191 --> 00:38:05,090
- Is this poo pad pong karee? - Yes, poo pad pong karee.

1129
00:38:05,091 --> 00:38:06,630
Poo pad pong karee and papaya salad.

1130
00:38:06,631 --> 00:38:08,130
(Poo pad pong karee)

1131
00:38:08,131 --> 00:38:10,870
This is like the dishes Thai families would eat at home.

1132
00:38:10,871 --> 00:38:12,131
(Poo pad pong karee and papaya salad)

1133
00:38:12,441 --> 00:38:13,841
This salad...

1134
00:38:14,771 --> 00:38:17,910
is made with shredded green papaya.

1135
00:38:17,911 --> 00:38:20,040
It's similar to Korea's...

1136
00:38:20,041 --> 00:38:21,880
white radish salad and is spicy.

1137
00:38:21,881 --> 00:38:23,151
(Shredded green papaya and chili, Similar to a white radish salad)

1138

(The harmony of zingy and spicy, Papaya salad)

1139
00:38:30,691 --> 00:38:32,890
- Is that curry? - Yes.

1140
00:38:32,891 --> 00:38:34,521
- Is this curry? - It's poo pad pong karee.

1141
00:38:35,191 --> 00:38:36,861
- It's a crab dish. - Yes, crabs.

1142
00:38:37,091 --> 00:38:38,230
It's made with softshell crabs.

1143
00:38:38,231 --> 00:38:40,301
These crabs are harvested right after shedding their exoskeleton,

1144
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,160
when their outer shell is still soft.

1145
00:38:42,161 --> 00:38:45,271

(Thailand's popular curry dish, Poo pad pong karee)

1147
00:38:51,341 --> 00:38:52,810
(The tom yum kung pho is served immediately after.)

1148
00:38:52,811 --> 00:38:54,181
- That must be spicy. - Look.

1149
00:38:54,711 --> 00:38:56,350
You should try the soup first.

1150
00:38:56,351 --> 00:38:57,650
- The tom yum kung? - It's one of the world's...

1151
00:38:57,651 --> 00:38:58,710
top three soups.

1152
00:38:58,711 --> 00:38:59,720
(UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity)

1153
00:38:59,721 --> 00:39:00,721

1154
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:06,091

1155
00:39:06,891 --> 00:39:10,461
(Eyes opening wide)

1156
00:39:10,691 --> 00:39:11,760
(No way!)

1157
00:39:11,761 --> 00:39:12,860
- Is it good? - Yes.

1158
00:39:12,861 --> 00:39:14,601
- It's delicious. - Isn't it good?

1159
00:39:15,261 --> 00:39:16,571
This...

1160
00:39:16,901 --> 00:39:19,070
This is easy for Korean people to try.

1161
00:39:19,071 --> 00:39:21,341
(Even someone new to Thai cuisine can enjoy the dish!)

1162
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:22,971
Good.

1163
00:39:24,811 --> 00:39:27,040
(How Kim Poong eats: A crab on top of the rice...)

1164
00:39:27,041 --> 00:39:29,250
(topped with cilantro!)

1165
00:39:29,251 --> 00:39:30,711
You should have this with cilantro.

1166
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:33,921
He must enjoy cilantro.

1167

1168
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:39,991
Look at them eat.

1169
00:39:40,921 --> 00:39:42,020
Are these crabs?

1170
00:39:42,021 --> 00:39:43,391
Are these blue crabs?

1171
00:39:43,561 --> 00:39:45,060
I'm loving the texture...

1172
00:39:45,061 --> 00:39:46,200
of the shell.

1173
00:39:46,201 --> 00:39:48,200
These delicious crabs are soft.

1174
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:49,631
Soft enough to eat the shells.

1175
00:39:49,701 --> 00:39:52,071
These are crabs we're familiar with.

1176
00:39:52,801 --> 00:39:57,541
(Seung Ho quickly joins in following Sang Uk's high praise.)

1177

(No way!)

1178
00:39:58,871 --> 00:40:00,340
That's really good.

(His frown says it all.)

1180
00:40:02,511 --> 00:40:03,550
This is...

1181
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:05,311
the best poo pad pong karee I've ever had.

1182
00:40:06,051 --> 00:40:07,450
It's so good, and it's just how I like it.

1185
00:40:14,091 --> 00:40:15,561
- This is also good. - Can I have this?

1186
00:40:16,631 --> 00:40:17,731
Is it authentic?

1187
00:40:17,861 --> 00:40:18,960
Yes, the flavors are authentic.

1188
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:20,401
It's as if we were in...

1189
00:40:20,561 --> 00:40:23,870
This is the benefit of hiring a chef from Thailand.

1190
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:25,371
(Authentic flavors are created over long hours by Thai chefs.)

1191

(Seung Ho slurps the soup first.)

1192
00:40:29,241 --> 00:40:30,741

Dong Hyun,

1194
00:40:32,741 --> 00:40:33,811
this is amazing.

1195
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:35,541
Tom yum kung is the best.

1196
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:40,851
(Sang Uk boldly tries the tom yum kung.)

1197
00:40:43,291 --> 00:40:47,791
(Eyes darting all over the place)

1198
00:40:48,061 --> 00:40:51,230
(He tries some again just to be sure.)

1199
00:40:51,231 --> 00:40:54,261
(What?)

1200
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:57,100
- Sang Uk's not pleased. - Why not?

1201
00:40:57,101 --> 00:40:58,301
- What's wrong? - You know,

1202
00:40:58,431 --> 00:41:00,041
it's my first time having tom yum kung.

1203
00:41:00,701 --> 00:41:03,240
- It tasted like an insecticide. - Really?

1204
00:41:03,241 --> 00:41:05,470
- It's like that at first. - That's how it is at first.

1205
00:41:05,471 --> 00:41:06,780
I couldn't eat it at first either.

1206
00:41:06,781 --> 00:41:07,810
- This... - It's addictive.

1207
00:41:07,811 --> 00:41:09,480
You'll think of this at home.

1208
00:41:09,481 --> 00:41:10,751
He's not wrong.

1209
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:13,180
Try the papaya salad.

1210
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:15,021
You must have it with rice.

1211
00:41:15,151 --> 00:41:16,250
Have it with the rice.

1212
00:41:16,251 --> 00:41:18,351
Papaya salad tastes great with rice.

1213
00:41:18,691 --> 00:41:19,961
It's basically Thai kimchi.

1214
00:41:19,991 --> 00:41:21,121
You'll be thinking about that later on.

1215
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:23,761
- With cilantro. - Sure.

1216
00:41:23,831 --> 00:41:25,461
Sang Uk, is it your first time having papaya salad?

1217
00:41:25,591 --> 00:41:26,900
Everything's a first for me.

1218
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,130
I haven't had Thai food before.

1219
00:41:28,131 --> 00:41:29,931
(His first time having papaya salad)

1220
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:32,270
(After helping Sang Uk, )

1221
00:41:32,271 --> 00:41:37,241
(he inhales the salad.)

1222
00:41:37,471 --> 00:41:38,710
Exactly.

1223
00:41:38,711 --> 00:41:40,641
Poo pad pong karee...

1224
00:41:42,611 --> 00:41:47,751
(Sang Uk tries some as well.)

1225
00:41:48,251 --> 00:41:49,550
- This is good. - Right?

1226
00:41:49,551 --> 00:41:50,590
It's good.

1227
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,351
This is insane.

1228
00:41:54,121 --> 00:41:56,260
This goes so well with cilantro.

1229
00:41:56,261 --> 00:41:58,431
(This goes so well with cilantro.)

1230
00:41:58,631 --> 00:41:59,761
- A bite? - That's right.

1231
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:05,731
(Having more since it's that good)

1232
00:42:07,671 --> 00:42:08,840
That's insane.

1233
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:10,711
(From today on, he has become a lover of Thai cuisine.)

1234
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:13,361
This is a Thai-style omelet.

1235
00:42:13,362 --> 00:42:15,131
- That's so good. - That's really good.

1236
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:16,301
This...

1237
00:42:16,302 --> 00:42:18,231
People don't order this because they don't know about it,

1238
00:42:18,232 --> 00:42:19,302
but I get it every time.

1239
00:42:19,502 --> 00:42:21,432
This is delicious. It's to die for.

1240
00:42:22,272 --> 00:42:23,971
Here's the Thai-style fried pork.

1241
00:42:23,972 --> 00:42:25,141
- No way! - Nice.

1242
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:26,641
It was covered in sesame seeds and then deep fried.

1243
00:42:26,642 --> 00:42:28,711
You'll find it savory and crispy.

1244
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:30,082
The flavors from a local restaurant.

1245
00:42:30,442 --> 00:42:34,152
(After sesame seeds are sprinkled evenly on pork belly, )

1246
00:42:35,382 --> 00:42:42,992
(it is deep fried. Moo sam chan tod)

1247
00:42:44,122 --> 00:42:48,532
(The Thai-style omelet with pork and vegetables)

1248
00:42:49,462 --> 00:42:54,301
(Cooked as if it was deep fried in oil)

1249
00:42:54,302 --> 00:42:57,772
(Crispy on the outside, moist on the inside)

1250
00:42:59,302 --> 00:43:01,771
You know what I said about this earlier.

1251
00:43:01,772 --> 00:43:03,641
- Just try it. - How do you have it?

1252
00:43:03,642 --> 00:43:04,681
Just as is.

1253
00:43:04,682 --> 00:43:06,251
Put a big chunk of it in your mouth.

1254
00:43:06,252 --> 00:43:07,452
- Just like that? - Yes.

1255
00:43:07,482 --> 00:43:08,682
- Like this? - Yes.

1256
00:43:08,912 --> 00:43:10,081
You'll be surprised.

1257
00:43:10,082 --> 00:43:12,121
(Having a big chunk of it like Dong Hyun said)

1258
00:43:12,122 --> 00:43:13,122
Look at that.

1259
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:15,321
Doesn't it have rich flavors?

1260
00:43:15,322 --> 00:43:16,662
I don't know why, though.

1261
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:18,861
It's because of the fish sauce.

1262
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:20,261
- Fish sauce? - There's fish sauce in it.

1263
00:43:20,262 --> 00:43:21,391
(Like Poong said, there's fish sauce in it.)

1264
00:43:21,392 --> 00:43:22,831
No wonder he's a chef.

1265
00:43:22,832 --> 00:43:23,932
(Of course, he knew.)

1266
00:43:24,662 --> 00:43:28,032
(Meanwhile, what did Seung Ho try?)

1267
00:43:28,302 --> 00:43:30,401
(Known as the savory king)

1268
00:43:30,402 --> 00:43:32,502
(Thai-style fried pork, moo sam chan tod)

1269
00:43:33,012 --> 00:43:36,212
(He gets ready to eat the next piece while chewing.)

1270
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:40,112
(What was the name of this again?)

1271
00:43:40,612 --> 00:43:43,082
Moo sam chan tod.

1272
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:46,951
It's a killer.

1273
00:43:46,952 --> 00:43:48,321
(It's that good.)

1274
00:43:48,322 --> 00:43:50,521
- Which one? - I'm sorry.

1275
00:43:50,522 --> 00:43:52,792
(How tasty is it really?)

1276
00:43:53,032 --> 00:43:54,092
Is that it?

1277
00:43:54,232 --> 00:43:55,962
Moo sam chan tod is really good.

1278
00:43:56,162 --> 00:43:58,632
(Both of them are amazed at the same time.)

1279
00:43:59,202 --> 00:44:01,432
As for the pork belly,

1280
00:44:01,832 --> 00:44:04,801
the fatty part of a tasty one...

1281
00:44:04,802 --> 00:44:06,812
has a crisp texture.

1282
00:44:08,642 --> 00:44:10,341
- Is that crisp? - When I chew it,

1283
00:44:10,342 --> 00:44:11,941
its juiciness comes...

1284
00:44:11,942 --> 00:44:14,581
into my mouth with a crisp texture.

1285
00:44:14,582 --> 00:44:16,622
(Its juiciness explodes with a chewy and crisp texture.)

1286
00:44:17,252 --> 00:44:18,722
I should try that one.

1287
00:44:19,152 --> 00:44:20,852
- Give us a quiz. - Give us something.

1288
00:44:21,222 --> 00:44:22,252
A quiz.

1289
00:44:22,722 --> 00:44:24,462
- Okay. - Okay. A quiz.

1290
00:44:24,622 --> 00:44:26,791
I'll give a simple quiz right away.

1291
00:44:26,792 --> 00:44:29,062
Please wait.

1292
00:44:29,292 --> 00:44:30,302
Why?

1293
00:44:31,362 --> 00:44:32,401
(I'm so nervous.)

1294
00:44:32,402 --> 00:44:33,472
- I'm nervous. - Right.

1295
00:44:34,372 --> 00:44:35,602
Okay. Here's the quiz.

1296
00:44:35,832 --> 00:44:38,041
Who makes money after nailing it?

1297
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:39,971
After nailing it? What?

1298
00:44:39,972 --> 00:44:41,771
They make money after nailing something.

1299
00:44:41,772 --> 00:44:42,842
Who are they?

1300
00:44:43,012 --> 00:44:44,042
After nailing something?

1301
00:44:45,112 --> 00:44:46,481
A rich man?

1302
00:44:46,482 --> 00:44:47,752
It's so easy.

1303
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:50,552
Can you give us a hint? Is it a foreign name?

1304
00:44:50,952 --> 00:44:52,622
- No. - Is it a Korean name?

1305
00:44:53,052 --> 00:44:54,252
- Yes. - A Korean word.

1306
00:44:54,652 --> 00:44:58,661
They nailed it? What did they nail?

1307
00:44:58,662 --> 00:44:59,792
(Confused)

1308
00:45:00,292 --> 00:45:01,762
They have become rich after nailing something?

1309
00:45:01,932 --> 00:45:03,561
But don't focus on getting rich...

1310
00:45:03,562 --> 00:45:05,461
- after nailing things. - Not on getting rich.

1311
00:45:05,462 --> 00:45:07,372
- They make money after nailing it. - They make money.

1312
00:45:07,472 --> 00:45:09,672
They make money after nailing it.

1313
00:45:10,002 --> 00:45:12,671
Making big money after nailing it, right?

1314
00:45:12,672 --> 00:45:15,271
Making a lot of money after nailing it.

1315
00:45:15,272 --> 00:45:16,882
(He also has no idea, though.)

1316
00:45:17,112 --> 00:45:18,642
- Do you want a hint? - Yes.

1317
00:45:18,942 --> 00:45:20,412
Okay. Here's a hint.

1318
00:45:20,652 --> 00:45:23,022
Who makes money after "nailing" it?

1319
00:45:24,522 --> 00:45:26,621
(Nail?)

1320
00:45:26,622 --> 00:45:29,192
Okay. I'm onto something.

1321
00:45:29,862 --> 00:45:31,392
- I think I got it. - I got it.

1322
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,331
- A carpenter. - I was going to say that.

1323
00:45:33,332 --> 00:45:34,332
Correct.

1324
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:40,132
- That's right. - "After nailing it."

1325
00:45:40,632 --> 00:45:43,272
- I should speak faster next time. - This is...

1326
00:45:43,972 --> 00:45:45,841
(Dong Hyun chooses the moo sam chan tod.)

1327
00:45:45,842 --> 00:45:46,941
Take two pieces.

1328
00:45:46,942 --> 00:45:48,171
- Dip them lightly. - Eat it like that.

1329
00:45:48,172 --> 00:45:49,241
(Taking two pieces of meat)

1330
00:45:49,242 --> 00:45:50,711
- You can dip it deeply. - It's tasty.

1331
00:45:50,712 --> 00:45:51,782
You can dip it in a lot of sauce.

1332
00:45:52,142 --> 00:45:53,382
Gosh. It's tasty.

1333
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:58,922
I love it.

1334
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:04,592
You still can't get Coke, though.

1335
00:46:05,222 --> 00:46:06,392
It's really good.

1336
00:46:06,562 --> 00:46:10,631
The fatty part of the pork belly is flavorful, right?

1337
00:46:10,632 --> 00:46:12,232
When you fry it on top of that,

1338
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:14,372
it's ultimately flavorful.

1339
00:46:14,702 --> 00:46:16,802
- It's crunchy. - It has a crunchy texture too.

1340
00:46:18,272 --> 00:46:20,012
Seung Ho, that's my favorite, though.

1341
00:46:20,242 --> 00:46:22,871
- Which one? This? - The poo pad pong karee. Yes.

1342
00:46:22,872 --> 00:46:24,542
The poo pad pong karee is his favorite.

1343
00:46:26,212 --> 00:46:28,711
(The younger one steals, and the older one eats in secret.)

1344
00:46:28,712 --> 00:46:30,582
It's tasty. It's good.

1345
00:46:30,752 --> 00:46:32,052
- It's good. - It tastes good.

1346
00:46:32,282 --> 00:46:34,221
(A new rascal)

1347
00:46:34,222 --> 00:46:35,422
That one's tasty.

1348
00:46:37,662 --> 00:46:40,431
Excuse me. Can we get more cilantro?

1349
00:46:40,432 --> 00:46:41,562
(They try to steal food too.)

1350
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:46,031
Wait. Excuse me.

1351
00:46:46,032 --> 00:46:47,602
No. Come on.

1352
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,841
- I knew it. - Come on.

1353
00:46:49,842 --> 00:46:50,842
What?

1354
00:46:50,843 --> 00:46:52,671
(He's a man with a decisive move.)

1355
00:46:52,672 --> 00:46:54,771
- Come on. - It wasn't Kyung Soo's fault.

1356
00:46:54,772 --> 00:46:56,442
I didn't know you were like this, Kyung Soo.

1357
00:46:57,182 --> 00:46:59,382
It was my bad to put the food in front of him.

1358
00:46:59,852 --> 00:47:01,052
Come on. The food keeps...

1359
00:47:01,112 --> 00:47:02,981
- They keep taking the food. - Take it.

1360
00:47:02,982 --> 00:47:04,421
- Why did you put it here? - It came here.

1361
00:47:04,422 --> 00:47:05,521
(Chewing shamelessly)

1362
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,592
- Come on. - Gosh. It's tasty.

1363
00:47:08,122 --> 00:47:12,262
(But the invisible hand's work isn't finished.)

1364
00:47:12,862 --> 00:47:15,031
(Trying to hide it with a cough)

1365
00:47:15,032 --> 00:47:17,401
- Wait. When did you take it? - I was going to open it for you.

1366
00:47:17,402 --> 00:47:20,201
- You were so hard on me before. - No.

1367
00:47:20,202 --> 00:47:21,431
I was going to give it to you.

1368
00:47:21,432 --> 00:47:23,741
You're a bad actor, so you keep getting caught.

1369
00:47:23,742 --> 00:47:26,041
- Why are you so into me? - Come on.

1370
00:47:26,042 --> 00:47:27,311
Focus on the food.

1371
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:28,712
That's what I want to say.

1372
00:47:29,742 --> 00:47:31,081
The number of glasses keeps growing.

1373
00:47:31,082 --> 00:47:33,712
(Dong Hyun's attempted food heist ended with more glasses.)

1374
00:47:34,252 --> 00:47:35,751
(Focusing back on eating after stopping them)

1375
00:47:35,752 --> 00:47:37,321
Eating two pieces isn't enough.

1376
00:47:37,322 --> 00:47:38,652
(Focusing back on eating after stopping them)

1377
00:47:38,682 --> 00:47:39,751
You eat with gusto.

1378
00:47:39,752 --> 00:47:42,151
- I.. - Give us some leftovers.

1379
00:47:42,152 --> 00:47:43,961
- Look at Poong. - This doesn't count.

1380
00:47:43,962 --> 00:47:45,521
(Inhaling the food like a vacuum)

1381
00:47:45,522 --> 00:47:48,092
Hey, Poong. Slow down.

1382
00:47:49,262 --> 00:47:51,062
Why are you eating so hurriedly?

1383
00:47:51,662 --> 00:47:55,131
Do you have to go and pick up your kid or what?

1384
00:47:55,132 --> 00:47:57,502
- That's right. - Is it because it's about time...

1385
00:47:57,572 --> 00:47:59,372
your child comes back from nursery?

1386
00:48:00,012 --> 00:48:01,171
Gosh. This is really...

1387
00:48:01,172 --> 00:48:02,172
(Devouring food because it's tasty)

1388
00:48:02,173 --> 00:48:03,981
He eats like a chef.

1389
00:48:03,982 --> 00:48:07,752
(Expecting a reward)

1390
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:10,222
You look hot when you eat.

1391
00:48:11,082 --> 00:48:12,122
Thank you.

1392
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:14,192
- Thank you. - You look handsome.

1393
00:48:14,792 --> 00:48:16,821
- What do you want to eat? - This one.

1394
00:48:16,822 --> 00:48:18,291
- This one. - Can I ask for it?

1395
00:48:18,292 --> 00:48:19,421
(Asking for it at the speed of light)

1396
00:48:19,422 --> 00:48:21,891
- Just do it. - He shares it without a question.

1397
00:48:21,892 --> 00:48:23,061
(He has learned the trick of freeloading in a few hours.)

1398
00:48:23,062 --> 00:48:24,102
It's because...

1399
00:48:24,932 --> 00:48:26,501
- You're giving food to him. - It's because...

1400
00:48:26,502 --> 00:48:27,532
It's up to him.

1401
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:31,142
(Savoring)

1402
00:48:31,372 --> 00:48:32,771
It's so flavorful.

1403
00:48:32,772 --> 00:48:33,812
(Mumbling)

1404
00:48:34,272 --> 00:48:35,842
Are you Choi Hong Man?

1405
00:48:36,482 --> 00:48:38,881
- "It's flavorful." - Please say, "I'm Choi Hong Man."

1406
00:48:38,882 --> 00:48:40,211
I'm Choi Hong Man.

1407
00:48:40,212 --> 00:48:41,251
(He masters a new impression today.)

1408
00:48:41,252 --> 00:48:43,482
- It's flavorful. - It's flavorful.

1409
00:48:44,752 --> 00:48:46,451
(The bill comes before they knew it.)

1410
00:48:46,452 --> 00:48:48,222
The price isn't bad.

1411
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,922
- The price is really good. - How much is it?

1412
00:48:51,322 --> 00:48:52,792
It's 163.5 dollars.

1413
00:48:53,632 --> 00:48:55,432
It's about 164 dollars for 8 dishes.

1414
00:48:55,692 --> 00:48:57,401
It's a good price for eight dishes.

1415
00:48:57,402 --> 00:48:59,701
But we ordered seven Cokes.

1416
00:48:59,702 --> 00:49:01,801
(It's the price for 8 dishes and 7 Cokes.)

1417
00:49:01,802 --> 00:49:04,372
In that case, isn't this a Coke place?

1418
00:49:04,502 --> 00:49:05,741
Isn't it a Coke restaurant?

1419
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:06,772
(They had Cokes with the sides of food.)

1420
00:49:07,212 --> 00:49:08,371
Okay. Here is the quiz.

1421
00:49:08,372 --> 00:49:09,372
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

1422
00:49:09,373 --> 00:49:10,712
It's a quiz on Thailand.

1423
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:13,481
As Thai people believe in the existence of deities,

1424
00:49:13,482 --> 00:49:15,752
they have various superstitions.

1425
00:49:15,882 --> 00:49:17,152
Of the following superstitions,

1426
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:19,821
which one is not a superstition...

1427
00:49:19,822 --> 00:49:20,952
- of Thailand? - It's a multiple-choice question.

1428
00:49:21,352 --> 00:49:22,352
It's a multiple-choice.

1429
00:49:23,052 --> 00:49:26,062
Number One, not telling a baby it's cute.

1430
00:49:27,732 --> 00:49:30,532
Number Two, wiping the mirror clean.

1431
00:49:30,632 --> 00:49:31,862
(Confused)

1432
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:34,802
Number Three, not chewing gum at night.

1433
00:49:36,802 --> 00:49:39,842
Number Four, keeping a baby doll at home.

1434
00:49:40,712 --> 00:49:42,112
- What's not a superstition? - You're right.

1435
00:49:42,642 --> 00:49:44,612
They're all Thai superstitions except for one.

1436
00:49:45,212 --> 00:49:46,282
- They're... - That's right.

1437
00:49:47,052 --> 00:49:50,451
Hey. But can you not say that a baby is cute?

1438
00:49:50,452 --> 00:49:51,452
Exactly.

1439
00:49:51,722 --> 00:49:53,721
But in Northeast Asia,

1440
00:49:53,722 --> 00:49:56,661
they say If you adore a baby too much, they take it away.

1441
00:49:56,662 --> 00:49:59,721
That's why they give childhood names...

1442
00:49:59,722 --> 00:50:01,392
such as Gae Ddong or So Ddong.

1443
00:50:01,462 --> 00:50:03,601
- So, Number One might be... - It's correct, then.

1444
00:50:03,602 --> 00:50:08,002
A superstition from this area. Either Japan, China, or Korea.

1445
00:50:08,932 --> 00:50:11,872
Wiping the mirror clean sounds about right.

1446
00:50:12,272 --> 00:50:13,311
- Doesn't it? - Yes.

1447
00:50:13,312 --> 00:50:15,112
You need to keep the mirror clean.

1448
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:18,512
What does your gut say?

1449
00:50:18,542 --> 00:50:19,542
He's good at this.

1450
00:50:20,652 --> 00:50:23,951
As for Number 1 and Number 4...

1451
00:50:23,952 --> 00:50:27,091
- What does your gut... - A baby is mentioned...

1452
00:50:27,092 --> 00:50:29,491
in two options, whether it was 1 and 4 or others.

1453
00:50:29,492 --> 00:50:33,261
They were deliberately placed there to confuse us.

1454
00:50:33,262 --> 00:50:35,261
- So I think it's either 2 or 3. - Either 2 or 3.

1455
00:50:35,262 --> 00:50:36,262
If it's either 2 or 3,

1456
00:50:36,263 --> 00:50:37,301
- I think it's Number 3. - That's why I think Number 2 is...

1457
00:50:37,302 --> 00:50:38,361
- What? - What?

1458
00:50:38,362 --> 00:50:40,132
You two can play rock-paper-scissors...

1459
00:50:41,132 --> 00:50:42,172
to choose one.

1460
00:50:42,232 --> 00:50:44,271
I think I've seen people chewing gum at night in Thailand.

1461
00:50:44,272 --> 00:50:45,272
(I think I've seen people chewing gum at night in Thailand.)

1462
00:50:45,472 --> 00:50:47,241
- Okay. Number Three. - Let's go, Poong.

1463
00:50:47,242 --> 00:50:48,411
- Let's go. - Please say it.

1464
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:49,442
Number Three.

1465
00:50:50,182 --> 00:50:53,181
Number Three, not chewing gum at night,

1466
00:50:53,182 --> 00:50:54,212
isn't a superstition of Thailand.

1467
00:50:54,852 --> 00:50:55,852
Correct.

1468
00:50:56,682 --> 00:50:57,922
Honestly, you were surprised, weren't you?

1469
00:50:58,822 --> 00:51:00,251
- They were shocked. - Nice.

1470
00:51:00,252 --> 00:51:01,791
(Now the bill goes to the team who didn't eat.)

1471
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:03,151
I knew it. You approached it very well.

1472
00:51:03,152 --> 00:51:04,862
(Anxious)

1473
00:51:05,422 --> 00:51:07,031
- It has come to be again. - Thank you.

1474
00:51:07,032 --> 00:51:08,032
Yes.

1475
00:51:09,392 --> 00:51:10,631
Did you make up Number Three?

1476
00:51:10,632 --> 00:51:13,431
Not chewing gum at night is a superstition of Turkiye.

1477
00:51:13,432 --> 00:51:15,001
- It's from Turkiye. - I see.

1478
00:51:15,002 --> 00:51:16,102
- It's from a different country. - It does exist.

1479
00:51:16,802 --> 00:51:18,971
I'll give you a slogan quiz.

1480
00:51:18,972 --> 00:51:20,712
- Okay. - It's been a while.

1481
00:51:21,212 --> 00:51:23,511
There are two blanks in the slogan.

1482
00:51:23,512 --> 00:51:25,241
Please fill in the blanks.

1483
00:51:25,242 --> 00:51:26,751
- Two people will be exempted. - Yes.

1484
00:51:26,752 --> 00:51:28,252
- That's right. - Good. We get two chances.

1485
00:51:28,352 --> 00:51:31,752
Keep A visible, and keep B clear.

1486
00:51:32,352 --> 00:51:34,992
- It's a safety slogan. - A safety slogan.

1487
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:37,662
- I got it. - Okay.

1488
00:51:38,862 --> 00:51:40,762
A is fire extinguishers.

1489
00:51:41,462 --> 00:51:42,631
- Keep fire extinguishers visible. - Goodness.

1490
00:51:42,632 --> 00:51:43,961
- I think it's correct. - Correct.

1491
00:51:43,962 --> 00:51:45,602
(Fire extinguishers)

1492
00:51:46,202 --> 00:51:49,231
(Did he get it on his first try?)

1493
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:50,341
Fire extinguishers. I did it.

1494
00:51:50,342 --> 00:51:52,042
- "Keep fire extinguishers visible." - Fire extinguishers.

1495
00:51:52,472 --> 00:51:54,442
Is it "keep extinguishing clear?"

1496
00:51:55,012 --> 00:51:56,272
What do you call the act of putting out a fire?

1497
00:51:56,472 --> 00:51:57,812
- I got it. - Is it extinguishing?

1498
00:51:58,042 --> 00:51:59,281
- Fire prevention? - I got it!

1499
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,581
If you don't get it, he will.

1500
00:52:00,582 --> 00:52:02,451
- I got it. - If I get it wrong, it's over.

1501
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,921
- I'm next. - What do you call it?

1502
00:52:03,922 --> 00:52:05,282
I said it before.

1503
00:52:06,592 --> 00:52:08,992
I got it!

1504
00:52:09,492 --> 00:52:10,561
The people outside might actually think...

1505
00:52:10,562 --> 00:52:12,821
- that he's calling them. - I got it!

1506
00:52:12,822 --> 00:52:14,032
(He's desperate not to pay consecutively.)

1507
00:52:14,632 --> 00:52:15,732
Okay. Extinguishing.

1508
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:17,132
Extinguishing?

1509
00:52:17,832 --> 00:52:19,602
- Incorrect. - I got it.

1510
00:52:20,332 --> 00:52:21,602
I got it. Fire hydrants.

1511
00:52:21,802 --> 00:52:23,342
Fire hydrants? Incorrect.

1512
00:52:24,172 --> 00:52:26,671
- I got it. - What was that?

1513
00:52:26,672 --> 00:52:27,711
(What was the fuss about?)

1514
00:52:27,712 --> 00:52:28,811
- I got it. - Okay.

1515
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:30,111
- Emergency exits. - Emergency exits. Correct.

1516
00:52:30,112 --> 00:52:32,342
(Emergency exits)

1517
00:52:32,442 --> 00:52:34,182
That's right.

1518
00:52:34,452 --> 00:52:35,951
That's correct.

1519
00:52:35,952 --> 00:52:37,482
- He survives dramatically. - That's it.

1520
00:52:37,922 --> 00:52:39,052
- That was dramatic. - No way.

1521
00:52:39,252 --> 00:52:40,521
He saved himself dramatically.

1522
00:52:40,522 --> 00:52:42,091
(You can relax now, my heart.)

1523
00:52:42,092 --> 00:52:43,292
He escaped it dramatically.

1524
00:52:44,362 --> 00:52:46,561
Here's another slogan quiz.

1525
00:52:46,562 --> 00:52:48,591
- I always get the slogans wrong. - Okay.

1526
00:52:48,592 --> 00:52:49,662
Kyung Soo is good.

1527
00:52:49,932 --> 00:52:53,132
The final destination of drowsy driving isn't this.

1528
00:52:53,502 --> 00:52:54,831
- That one. - That's seen a lot.

1529
00:52:54,832 --> 00:52:57,701
We always see it in the rest areas and on the highways.

1530
00:52:57,702 --> 00:52:59,401
- It's written big up there. - It's placed at many places.

1531
00:52:59,402 --> 00:53:01,911
- It's written in red suddenly. - The final destination...

1532
00:53:01,912 --> 00:53:03,412
drowsy driving isn't this?

1533
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:05,842
- Our world. - Our world?

1534
00:53:06,512 --> 00:53:07,882
- Incorrect. - The current life.

1535
00:53:08,482 --> 00:53:09,952
The current life? Incorrect.

1536
00:53:10,382 --> 00:53:11,552
Paradise.

1537
00:53:11,582 --> 00:53:12,982
Paradise? Incorrect.

1538
00:53:14,052 --> 00:53:16,051
- Yi Kyung was on the right track. - Okay.

1539
00:53:16,052 --> 00:53:17,661
But we want the specific word.

1540
00:53:17,662 --> 00:53:18,691
What? What did I say?

1541
00:53:18,692 --> 00:53:20,191
It's something like this life or the afterlife.

1542
00:53:20,192 --> 00:53:21,232
The king of the underworld!

1543
00:53:21,792 --> 00:53:22,862
Incorrect.

1544
00:53:22,892 --> 00:53:27,572
(I love you Just the way I feel right now)

1545
00:53:28,472 --> 00:53:30,441
(Quietly giving a big hint)

1546
00:53:30,442 --> 00:53:32,242
I got it. Afterlife.

1547
00:53:32,702 --> 00:53:33,942
- Incorrect. - Our world?

1548
00:53:34,042 --> 00:53:35,042
Incorrect.
(He finally hears it.)

1549
00:53:36,043 --> 00:53:37,782
- It's close to that. - I can't hear you.

1550
00:53:38,012 --> 00:53:39,441
- Please sing it louder. - I love you

1551
00:53:39,442 --> 00:53:41,351
- I know it. - Just the way

1552
00:53:41,352 --> 00:53:43,152
- I know it. - I feel right now

1553
00:53:44,082 --> 00:53:45,181
What is that?

1554
00:53:45,182 --> 00:53:47,292
(The end of wandering I've been waiting for)

1555
00:53:47,522 --> 00:53:49,552
- What was the song's title? - I got it. This place.

1556
00:53:50,062 --> 00:53:51,062
No.

1557
00:53:51,063 --> 00:53:52,191
It's "Into the New World."

1558
00:53:52,192 --> 00:53:53,592
This is "Into the New World."

1559
00:53:53,692 --> 00:53:55,291
- I love you - You

1560
00:53:55,292 --> 00:54:01,872
(Repeating the verse for now)

1561
00:54:02,732 --> 00:54:04,001
- This feeling? - Incorrect.

1562
00:54:04,002 --> 00:54:05,771
- Gosh. - Goodness. You're so close.

1563
00:54:05,772 --> 00:54:07,571
- I love you - I love you

1564
00:54:07,572 --> 00:54:09,671
(Singing it until they get it)

1565
00:54:09,672 --> 00:54:10,881
- But it's not "this feeling." - You're almost there.

1566
00:54:10,882 --> 00:54:13,281
- It's what comes next. - I've been waiting for

1567
00:54:13,282 --> 00:54:14,412
(The answer is right before their eyes.)

1568
00:54:14,712 --> 00:54:16,721
(The sadness that repeats...)

1569
00:54:16,722 --> 00:54:18,722
(This is the answer.)

1570
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,191
(They know the other verse precisely.)

1571
00:54:21,192 --> 00:54:22,192
Isn't that it?

1572
00:54:22,193 --> 00:54:23,221
I know it.

1573
00:54:23,222 --> 00:54:25,821
(The end of wandering I've been waiting for)

1574
00:54:25,822 --> 00:54:26,862
Do you get it?

1575
00:54:27,232 --> 00:54:30,462
(The sadness that repeats in...)

1576
00:54:30,802 --> 00:54:32,061
(Frustrated repeatedly)

1577
00:54:32,062 --> 00:54:33,672
Repeats in...

1578
00:54:33,872 --> 00:54:35,632
this world. I got it. This world!

1579
00:54:36,032 --> 00:54:37,041
Correct.

1580
00:54:37,042 --> 00:54:38,442
(This world)

1581
00:54:38,802 --> 00:54:41,041
(Saying goodbye...)

1582
00:54:41,042 --> 00:54:43,411
(to the quiz...)

1583
00:54:43,412 --> 00:54:47,152
(that has repeated for an hour here)

1584
00:54:47,382 --> 00:54:48,781
- I don't need the receipt. - Okay.

1585
00:54:48,782 --> 00:54:51,351
(Total: 163.5 dollars)

1586
00:54:51,352 --> 00:54:52,522
- We enjoyed it. - Thank you.

1587
00:54:52,752 --> 00:54:53,791
Thank you.

1588
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:56,491
(Saying goodbye...)

1589
00:54:56,492 --> 00:54:59,492
(to the new gourmet world of Thailand)

1590
00:55:00,332 --> 00:55:02,991
(The scorching heat doesn't fade away...)

1591
00:55:02,992 --> 00:55:05,732
(even in the late afternoon.)

1592
00:55:07,502 --> 00:55:09,801
(A cafe with a small garden in Bundang...)

1593
00:55:09,802 --> 00:55:10,871
(will let them cool off.)

1594
00:55:10,872 --> 00:55:12,301
- Are we ordering now? - Yes.

1595
00:55:12,302 --> 00:55:13,341
(A cafe with a small garden in Bundang...)

1596
00:55:13,342 --> 00:55:14,372
(will let them cool off.)

1597
00:55:15,172 --> 00:55:16,472
Can you do it from there?

1598
00:55:16,782 --> 00:55:18,012
He can do it from a distance.

1599
00:55:18,442 --> 00:55:20,252
- I can zoom in. - Hey.

1600
00:55:20,812 --> 00:55:22,612
The thread bingsu sounds delicious.

1601
00:55:22,982 --> 00:55:24,722
The apple mango bingsu... Wait.

1602
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,751
(The cafe is known for bingsu...)

1603
00:55:28,752 --> 00:55:32,422
(that will melt down the heat.)

1604
00:55:33,762 --> 00:55:35,732
- Yi Kyung, AMB? - Apple Mango Bingsu.

1605
00:55:36,062 --> 00:55:37,261
Yi Kyung will order... Okay.

1606
00:55:37,262 --> 00:55:39,001
We'll order 1 apple mango bingsu and 1 thread bingsu.

1607
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,531
- Okay. For that table? - Yes.

1608
00:55:40,532 --> 00:55:41,771
We can share them.

1609
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:43,071
You can order all you want.

1610
00:55:43,072 --> 00:55:45,202
- Really? I'll get hot coffee, then. - A hot one?

1611
00:55:45,302 --> 00:55:47,241
- Did you order a hot Americano? - No.

1612
00:55:47,242 --> 00:55:49,512
- I'll change it to an Einspanner. - Okay. I got it.

1613
00:55:49,912 --> 00:55:51,612
What is an Einspanner?

1614
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:54,651
An Einspanner is a drink in collaboration with Einstein.

1615
00:55:54,652 --> 00:55:55,652
Oh, dear.
(Teasing Tae Hyun)

1616
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:57,981
- Is it a smart drink? - You can tell me.

1617
00:55:57,982 --> 00:55:59,051
Einstein.

1618
00:55:59,052 --> 00:56:00,891
- It's almost like a meal. - I like it too.

1619
00:56:00,892 --> 00:56:01,992
(Order sheet: Thread bingsu, apple mango bingsu...)

1620
00:56:02,122 --> 00:56:05,061
In which year were you born, Kyung Soo?

1621
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:06,161
- I was born in 1992. - In 1992.

1622
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:07,631
- In 1992? - What?

1623
00:56:07,632 --> 00:56:09,061
- In 1992? - How old are you, then?

1624
00:56:09,062 --> 00:56:10,161
- No? - It's...

1625
00:56:10,162 --> 00:56:11,201
I'm 34 years old.

1626
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:13,902
Wait. Then are you younger than Bo Young?

1627
00:56:14,072 --> 00:56:15,372
Yes. I'm two years younger than her.

1628
00:56:16,102 --> 00:56:18,071
Did you treat her like an older one...

1629
00:56:18,072 --> 00:56:19,171
- when you were filming? - I did.

1630
00:56:19,172 --> 00:56:20,772
But people talked about it.

1631
00:56:21,512 --> 00:56:22,811
(People could have taken it the wrong way.)

1632
00:56:22,812 --> 00:56:23,981
- What did they talk about? - He has a low voice too.

1633
00:56:23,982 --> 00:56:25,081
About different stuff.

1634
00:56:25,082 --> 00:56:26,582
Was Bo Young okay with it?

1635
00:56:26,712 --> 00:56:28,512
She tolerated it like a grownup.

1636
00:56:30,352 --> 00:56:31,852
That's so funny.

1637
00:56:32,282 --> 00:56:34,422
Soon after this episode is aired,

1638
00:56:34,622 --> 00:56:36,191
Kyung Soo's new movie will be released.

1639
00:56:36,192 --> 00:56:37,361
- That's right. - Gosh.

1640
00:56:37,362 --> 00:56:38,791
- Talk about the movie. - Tell us about it.

1641
00:56:38,792 --> 00:56:40,061
You should promote it.

1642
00:56:40,062 --> 00:56:41,991
- You don't have to hide it. - No.

1643
00:56:41,992 --> 00:56:43,231
- I don't need to talk about it. - It's because...

1644
00:56:43,232 --> 00:56:44,731
its title makes him hide it.

1645
00:56:44,732 --> 00:56:45,732
Why?

1646
00:56:45,733 --> 00:56:47,571
The Korean title of "Homeward Bound" is "It's Bound to Be a Secret."

1647
00:56:47,572 --> 00:56:49,232
- "Homeward Bound." - But...

1648
00:56:49,702 --> 00:56:52,202
What is the movie about?

1649
00:56:53,202 --> 00:56:56,212
There was a woman.

1650
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:58,712
- There was a woman. - Is that how it starts?

1651
00:56:58,812 --> 00:57:02,812
Her husband died a long time ago.

1652
00:57:03,182 --> 00:57:04,681
All by herself,

1653
00:57:04,682 --> 00:57:06,381
she sent her son to study in Canada.

1654
00:57:06,382 --> 00:57:08,552
- I see. - One day, her son...

1655
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:10,521
- comes back to Korea... - Okay.

1656
00:57:10,522 --> 00:57:12,861
And introduces her girlfriend, saying he'll marry her...

1657
00:57:12,862 --> 00:57:14,162
- Okay. - out of the blue.

1658
00:57:14,292 --> 00:57:15,292
(Interested)
I'm getting curious.

1659
00:57:16,293 --> 00:57:19,102
But the girlfriend's family...

1660
00:57:19,332 --> 00:57:21,701
stays with them in the same house for an unfortunate reason.

1661
00:57:21,702 --> 00:57:25,771
It's about the uncomfortable story that unfolds in the house.

1662
00:57:25,772 --> 00:57:27,442
- And? - But I'm the good one.

1663
00:57:27,542 --> 00:57:28,642
- What? - What?

1664
00:57:28,772 --> 00:57:29,841
Don't spoil it.

1665
00:57:29,842 --> 00:57:31,181
Why did you spoil it? Come on.

1666
00:57:31,182 --> 00:57:32,611
- You spoiled it. - That's a twist.

1667
00:57:32,612 --> 00:57:35,382
- Which role do you play? - I play the son.

1668
00:57:35,552 --> 00:57:37,681
Jang Yeong Nam plays my mom.

1669
00:57:37,682 --> 00:57:39,652
She is your mother this time.

1670
00:57:39,952 --> 00:57:43,252
About Poong. I've been wondering if I should say this or not.

1671
00:57:43,492 --> 00:57:45,462
The clothes you're wearing...

1672
00:57:45,992 --> 00:57:47,161
Are they yours?

1673
00:57:47,162 --> 00:57:49,761
No. They've prepared them for me.

1674
00:57:49,762 --> 00:57:52,761
They keep reminding me of a beggar.

1675
00:57:52,762 --> 00:57:53,832
(They keep reminding me of a beggar.)

1676
00:57:54,002 --> 00:57:56,131
I thought so too.

1677
00:57:56,132 --> 00:57:57,672
- Right? - While looking at it...

1678
00:57:58,172 --> 00:57:59,601
I looked at my clothes...

1679
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:01,641
and thought I saw someone in them at marketplaces.

1680
00:58:01,642 --> 00:58:03,171
The colors are pretty, but...

1681
00:58:03,172 --> 00:58:06,412
when I keep looking at it, especially with your mustache...

1682
00:58:06,812 --> 00:58:08,681
- And the glasses. - Get me a janggu.

1683
00:58:08,682 --> 00:58:10,882
I'll play it. Do you have a janggu?

1684
00:58:11,022 --> 00:58:12,182
He accepts it very well.

1685
00:58:12,282 --> 00:58:14,522
Your glasses go up higher now that it's around 7pm.

1686
00:58:14,752 --> 00:58:16,851
The glasses keep... I don't know if my hair is coming down...

1687
00:58:16,852 --> 00:58:18,491
or the glasses are going up.

1688
00:58:18,492 --> 00:58:20,331
- In the end, - They were up here.

1689
00:58:20,332 --> 00:58:21,731
- will they be over the hair? - I mean,

1690
00:58:21,732 --> 00:58:22,891
this is frustrating. I want to show my forehead.

1691
00:58:22,892 --> 00:58:24,061
- Give me your glasses. - Why?

1692
00:58:24,062 --> 00:58:25,802
Don't you put your glasses on your nose?

1693
00:58:25,902 --> 00:58:27,771
Aren't they supposed to come down?

1694
00:58:27,772 --> 00:58:29,171
They should look like that.

1695
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,471
- They were like this. - Yes.

1696
00:58:30,472 --> 00:58:31,741
But they come up like this, right?

1697
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:32,742
(The glasses keep soaring.)

1698
00:58:32,802 --> 00:58:34,942
- Why do they go up? - That's too high.

1699
00:58:35,112 --> 00:58:36,772
Don't they usually come down?

1700
00:58:36,982 --> 00:58:38,941
- They usually slide down. - That's right.

1701
00:58:38,942 --> 00:58:41,051
Wait. They defy gravity.

1702
00:58:41,052 --> 00:58:43,312
- They go up. - They don't have lenses.

1703
00:58:43,582 --> 00:58:45,451
Because they are light,

1704
00:58:45,452 --> 00:58:47,321
- they go up. - Is it because there are no lenses?

1705
00:58:47,322 --> 00:58:48,492
It's because there are no lenses.

1706
00:58:49,552 --> 00:58:50,561
Thank you.

1707
00:58:50,562 --> 00:58:51,691
(After laughing together, the drinks and bingsu are here.)

1708
00:58:51,692 --> 00:58:52,792
- Thank you. - Can you...

1709
00:58:53,892 --> 00:58:55,032
They are so pretty.

1710
00:58:55,292 --> 00:58:56,362
Thank you.

1711
00:58:56,662 --> 00:58:58,001
- Look at the color. - Melon soda?

1712
00:58:58,002 --> 00:59:01,172
(Refreshing drinks with colorful fruits)

1713
00:59:02,102 --> 00:59:04,141
(Thread bingsu...)

1714
00:59:04,142 --> 00:59:06,772
(that layers milk like threads)

1715
00:59:07,872 --> 00:59:10,642
(Apple mango bingsu filled with refreshness)

1716
00:59:10,882 --> 00:59:12,042
Are they frog eggs?

1717
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:15,712
They are popping boba that we put on like caviar.

1718
00:59:16,112 --> 00:59:17,481
- They are from Taiwan. - I see.

1719
00:59:17,482 --> 00:59:18,581
Take yours.

1720
00:59:18,582 --> 00:59:20,221
And eat it on your own.

1721
00:59:20,222 --> 00:59:21,222
Gosh. I like it.

1722
00:59:22,052 --> 00:59:23,122
It's fudgy.

1723
00:59:23,192 --> 00:59:26,192
The thread has a crazy texture.

1724
00:59:26,392 --> 00:59:27,491
Because it's protein?

1725
00:59:27,492 --> 00:59:29,961
- It's high in protein. - Because it's high in protein.

1726
00:59:29,962 --> 00:59:31,532
It's whey protein isolate.

1727
00:59:32,362 --> 00:59:33,631
- I'll put it here. - I say that when I eat too.

1728
00:59:33,632 --> 00:59:34,632
It's complicated.

1729
00:59:34,633 --> 00:59:36,401
By the way, this has to be tasty.

1730
00:59:36,402 --> 00:59:37,942
(He enjoys the bingsu as is without any toppings.)

1731
00:59:39,372 --> 00:59:41,072
(Savoring)

1732
00:59:42,012 --> 00:59:44,212
- I love its texture. - I go to the Incheon Airport.

1733
00:59:45,142 --> 00:59:46,212
I love the texture.

1734
00:59:46,612 --> 00:59:48,851
(Poong, the beggar, mixes it with other ingredients.)

1735
00:59:48,852 --> 00:59:51,082
Maybe because this place is in Bundang,

1736
00:59:51,352 --> 00:59:52,782
- they make good desserts. - Yes.

1737
00:59:52,982 --> 00:59:54,151
It's the bean powder.

1738
00:59:54,152 --> 00:59:55,721
(Satisfied)

1739
00:59:55,722 --> 00:59:57,022
Hey. These are sweet rice puffs.

1740
00:59:57,292 --> 00:59:59,291
(Ice cream made of bean powder)

1741
00:59:59,292 --> 01:00:01,132
(Red beans, sweet rice puffs)

1742
01:00:01,362 --> 01:00:02,391
You're right.

1743
01:00:02,392 --> 01:00:04,761
(The small eater loves it too!)

1744
01:00:04,762 --> 01:00:05,932
The bean powder.

1745
01:00:08,032 --> 01:00:12,171
(This time, he puts the bean powder only on the threads.)

1746
01:00:12,172 --> 01:00:13,572
The milk and the bean powder go crazily well together.

1747
01:00:14,172 --> 01:00:15,172
This is good.

1748
01:00:15,173 --> 01:00:16,972
Gosh. This thread bingsu is awesome.

1749
01:00:20,382 --> 01:00:21,851
I see. These plates are for us to use.

1750
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:23,151
(It's time to try the apple mango bingsu.)

1751
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:24,481
I can scoop it up, can't I?

1752
01:00:24,482 --> 01:00:25,521
(He scoops bingsu with fresh apple mangos.)

1753
01:00:25,522 --> 01:00:26,552
And...

1754
01:00:27,492 --> 01:00:29,352
What is this? Mango ice cream?

1755
01:00:29,552 --> 01:00:30,961
- This? - It's sherbet.

1756
01:00:30,962 --> 01:00:33,591
(They ordered mango sherbet and mango pieces additionally.)

1757
01:00:33,592 --> 01:00:34,732
Should I try it like this?

1758
01:00:34,962 --> 01:00:36,162
The milk and the bean powder go crazily well together.

1759
01:00:36,762 --> 01:00:40,002
(Taking a big bite of the apple mango bingsu)

1760
01:00:40,332 --> 01:00:41,332
This is...

1761
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:48,672
(Its refreshness makes them keep eating.)

1762
01:00:53,512 --> 01:00:54,811
Gosh. This bingsu is tasty.

1763
01:00:54,812 --> 01:00:56,811
(Gosh. This bingsu is tasty.)

1764
01:00:56,812 --> 01:00:59,352
But what is that you're having, Poong?

1765
01:00:59,652 --> 01:01:01,192
- Is it coffee? - Eins-pain.

1766
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:02,791
- What? - No, it's an Einspanner.

1767
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:04,322
- An Einspanner? - "Eins-pain."

1768
01:01:04,492 --> 01:01:06,291
I think he said Einstein.

1769
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:08,091
After being here for a while,

1770
01:01:08,092 --> 01:01:10,461
I strangely got dumbed down.

1771
01:01:10,462 --> 01:01:12,801
- I'm getting weird. - You're really similar.

1772
01:01:12,802 --> 01:01:14,501
- You're really similar to Daniel. - Really?

1773
01:01:14,502 --> 01:01:15,872
- Are you becoming alike? - I don't know.

1774
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:19,902
When I see Kyung Soo, he's sitting still.

1775
01:01:20,672 --> 01:01:22,741
He doesn't do weightlifting.

1776
01:01:22,742 --> 01:01:24,042
He doesn't go to the gym at all.

1777
01:01:24,512 --> 01:01:26,641
Is it because of the role you're playing?

1778
01:01:26,642 --> 01:01:27,852
No. Because it hurts.

1779
01:01:28,182 --> 01:01:29,352
Where does it hurt?

1780
01:01:29,982 --> 01:01:32,182
- Because your muscles are sore? - Was it because it hurt?

1781
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:33,581
- They hurt after a workout. - After working out,

1782
01:01:33,582 --> 01:01:34,792
I can't extend my arms.

1783
01:01:35,122 --> 01:01:36,851
You're right. After working out,

1784
01:01:36,852 --> 01:01:37,891
- I can't extend my arms. - Because they are sore?

1785
01:01:37,892 --> 01:01:39,192
I know what it is.

1786
01:01:39,492 --> 01:01:40,831
I can't extend my arms after working out too.

1787
01:01:40,832 --> 01:01:43,362
Usually, they can't work out because they are hurt.

1788
01:01:43,562 --> 01:01:45,701
He's okay, but he doesn't work out because it will hurt.

1789
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:46,901
Right. You can't extend your arms.

1790
01:01:46,902 --> 01:01:48,031
- He's right. - Yes.

1791
01:01:48,032 --> 01:01:49,301
It should be straight like this,

1792
01:01:49,302 --> 01:01:50,541
- but it stops here. - You're right.

1793
01:01:50,542 --> 01:01:52,001
It stops right here.

1794
01:01:52,002 --> 01:01:54,372
Many people would agree with you.

1795
01:01:54,472 --> 01:01:56,041
After working out for a couple of days, they are sore.

1796
01:01:56,042 --> 01:01:57,911
- Your legs hurt after a leg day. - Yes.

1797
01:01:57,912 --> 01:01:59,481
It hurts when you push after working out your chest.

1798
01:01:59,482 --> 01:02:01,281
They don't work out because it gets uncomfortable.

1799
01:02:01,282 --> 01:02:02,711
But you have to overcome it, right?

1800
01:02:02,712 --> 01:02:05,021
After two weeks, your muscles won't be sore...

1801
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:06,181
- after a workout. - They won't.

1802
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:07,291
- Really? - They won't.

1803
01:02:07,292 --> 01:02:08,651
What do you do when you're free, then?

1804
01:02:08,652 --> 01:02:10,052
You have two days off.

1805
01:02:10,292 --> 01:02:11,392
I spend most of my time lying down.

1806
01:02:11,892 --> 01:02:12,921
You don't work out at all.

1807
01:02:12,922 --> 01:02:14,862
- In case you'll gain muscle? - I don't...

1808
01:02:16,192 --> 01:02:17,261
You're worried.

1809
01:02:17,262 --> 01:02:18,801
- The functional muscles. - Not you get the muscles.

1810
01:02:18,802 --> 01:02:20,032
In case I can't extend my arms.

1811
01:02:20,702 --> 01:02:22,132
So, how much are these?

1812
01:02:22,332 --> 01:02:24,441
It's around 130 dollars. It's 128.2 dollars.

1813
01:02:24,442 --> 01:02:25,442
(Total: 128.2 dollars)

1814
01:02:25,443 --> 01:02:29,572
(Who'll Pay for Bingsu? Time for Quiz)

1815
01:02:29,842 --> 01:02:33,482
To pick the one who will pay,

1816
01:02:33,882 --> 01:02:35,851
we'll play the Reverse Play Quiz.

1817
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:37,721
- That one's hard. - What is that?

1818
01:02:37,722 --> 01:02:39,252
They'll play a song in reverse.

1819
01:02:39,682 --> 01:02:42,492
It will be too tough for me if it's recent idols' songs.

1820
01:02:42,852 --> 01:02:45,522
I've played the song quiz for several years.

1821
01:02:45,692 --> 01:02:46,891
Dong Hyun must be good at it.

1822
01:02:46,892 --> 01:02:48,061
- He did it for seven years. - On "Amazing Saturday,"

1823
01:02:48,062 --> 01:02:49,261
do they play the song in reverse too?

1824
01:02:49,262 --> 01:02:51,032
- Yes, they do, but... - He must be good.

1825
01:02:51,232 --> 01:02:52,502
Some are born with it.

1826
01:02:52,902 --> 01:02:54,572
The ones who are good at it will always be good at it.

1827
01:02:54,632 --> 01:02:55,701
You can't get better at it.

1828
01:02:55,702 --> 01:02:57,472
When we get a quiz, Dong Hyun usually says,

1829
01:02:57,672 --> 01:02:59,541
"Come on. It's unfair for me."

1830
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:00,842
But today, he isn't complaining.

1831
01:03:01,272 --> 01:03:03,542
Okay. Play the music.

1832
01:03:03,742 --> 01:03:04,911
I'll get exempted first.

1833
01:03:04,912 --> 01:03:06,182
(Will Dong Hyun with the experience escape first?)

1834
01:03:10,782 --> 01:03:11,821
Dong Hyun.

1835
01:03:11,822 --> 01:03:12,921
(As soon as he hears the song)

1836
01:03:12,922 --> 01:03:14,052
- Please stop the song. - I got it!

1837
01:03:14,192 --> 01:03:15,652
- I know the song. - It's Dong Hyun.

1838
01:03:15,692 --> 01:03:16,751
It's Dong Hyun's turn.

1839
01:03:16,752 --> 01:03:17,792
(It's Dong Hyun's turn as expected.)

1840
01:03:18,822 --> 01:03:19,992
The title of the song is...

1841
01:03:20,792 --> 01:03:22,262
Hurry. Start the countdown.

1842
01:03:22,792 --> 01:03:23,861
(It's on the tip of his tongue.)

1843
01:03:23,862 --> 01:03:25,032
What was the song?

1844
01:03:25,362 --> 01:03:26,931
- Hurry and count down. - I'll pass.

1845
01:03:26,932 --> 01:03:27,971
- Pass. - Tae Hyun!

1846
01:03:27,972 --> 01:03:29,102
- Tae Hyun. - Okay.

1847
01:03:31,002 --> 01:03:32,302
"Candy in My Ears" by Baek Z Young.

1848
01:03:32,502 --> 01:03:33,502
Is it correct?

1849
01:03:33,972 --> 01:03:35,041
Is it correct?

1850
01:03:35,042 --> 01:03:36,212
(Will it be correct?)

1851
01:03:36,672 --> 01:03:38,012
- I think it's correct. - Correct.

1852
01:03:38,042 --> 01:03:39,111
(Tae Hyun is correct!)

1853
01:03:39,112 --> 01:03:40,112
- How... - I could tell from the last part.

1854
01:03:40,113 --> 01:03:41,651
- How could you tell? - Gosh.

1855
01:03:41,652 --> 01:03:43,151
- My ear's candy - I mean...

1856
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:46,252
(The answer is revealed.)

1857
01:03:46,552 --> 01:03:51,092
("My Ear's Candy" by Baek Z Young)

1858
01:03:57,132 --> 01:03:58,201
Did you know the answer?

1859
01:03:58,202 --> 01:03:59,361
I knew that it was Baek Z Young.

1860
01:03:59,362 --> 01:04:00,871
But I thought it was a different song.

1861
01:04:00,872 --> 01:04:02,401
I thought it was "Dash."

1862
01:04:02,402 --> 01:04:03,772
(A different song)

1863
01:04:03,932 --> 01:04:05,101
- Gosh. - Okay.

1864
01:04:05,102 --> 01:04:07,102
- Here comes the next song. - It sounds so different.

1865
01:04:07,142 --> 01:04:08,641
I have no idea about this one. I'm in trouble.

1866
01:04:08,642 --> 01:04:09,772
Okay. Next one.

1867
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:11,441
It's more similar than I imagined.

1868
01:04:11,442 --> 01:04:12,781
I can hear the similarities.

1869
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:13,982
Play the song.

1870
01:04:16,012 --> 01:04:18,121
(Istappa, istappa?)

1871
01:04:18,122 --> 01:04:19,322
Let me answer! Yi Kyung!

1872
01:04:19,752 --> 01:04:22,021
(I was one step behind.)

1873
01:04:22,022 --> 01:04:23,352
"APT." by Rose.

1874
01:04:24,392 --> 01:04:25,392
Correct.

1875
01:04:25,692 --> 01:04:26,761
I could hear it.

1876
01:04:26,762 --> 01:04:28,331
- I could hear it. - I could hear it.

1877
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:29,431
- I couldn't hear it. - I couldn't hear it.

1878
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:30,491
I could hear it.

1879
01:04:30,492 --> 01:04:31,962
I didn't know that it was Rose.

1880
01:04:32,962 --> 01:04:37,902
("APT." by Rose and Bruno Mars)

1881
01:04:38,802 --> 01:04:43,272
(Istappa, istappa)

1882
01:04:43,472 --> 01:04:45,312
- Okay. - I don't know.

1883
01:04:45,742 --> 01:04:47,181
Suddenly, Dong Hyun...

1884
01:04:47,182 --> 01:04:48,612
I can't get this right.

1885
01:04:48,982 --> 01:04:51,221
I always place last on "Amazing Saturday" too.

1886
01:04:51,222 --> 01:04:52,551
- It's hard. - Let's keep going.

1887
01:04:52,552 --> 01:04:53,751
I can make out the song...

1888
01:04:53,752 --> 01:04:55,051
- if I listen carefully. - Play the third song.

1889
01:04:55,052 --> 01:04:56,092
(3rd question with 5 members remaining)

1890
01:05:00,092 --> 01:05:01,532
- Seung Ho. - Seung Ho.

1891
01:05:02,862 --> 01:05:04,061
Taeyang's "Eyes, Nose, Lips."

1892
01:05:04,062 --> 01:05:05,802
- Okay. - I think it's correct.

1893
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:07,502
That's it.

1894
01:05:07,572 --> 01:05:08,631
(Dong Hyun thinks of something.)

1895
01:05:08,632 --> 01:05:09,771
- I think it's correct. - Correct.

1896
01:05:09,772 --> 01:05:11,001
(Taeyang's "Eyes, Nose, Lips" is correct!)

1897
01:05:11,002 --> 01:05:12,271
I heard the famous part.

1898
01:05:12,272 --> 01:05:13,371
How was that "Eyes, Nose, Lips?"

1899
01:05:13,372 --> 01:05:15,141
The usual ones are out. Now comes the big match.

1900
01:05:15,142 --> 01:05:16,312
(Seung Ho is exempt.)

1901
01:05:16,342 --> 01:05:18,281
The quizzes on this show are done...

1902
01:05:18,282 --> 01:05:19,311
with skills, not luck.

1903
01:05:19,312 --> 01:05:20,782
The members escape in the order of their skills.

1904
01:05:21,512 --> 01:05:23,352
- Kyung Soo, will you be okay? - Yes.

1905
01:05:23,612 --> 01:05:25,582
- I was practicing. - The usual ones are out.

1906
01:05:26,082 --> 01:05:27,121
Play the song.

1907
01:05:27,122 --> 01:05:31,462
(4th question gets played with 4 members remaining.)

1908
01:05:31,722 --> 01:05:35,591
(Blinking)

1909
01:05:35,592 --> 01:05:36,731
It's such a famous song.

1910
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:39,762
(They feel like they can recognize the voice.)

1911
01:05:40,602 --> 01:05:46,442
(Viewers, please guess with us.)

1912
01:05:47,242 --> 01:05:49,071
(The song stretches on, but these 4 members don't have a clue.)

1913
01:05:49,072 --> 01:05:50,141
Isn't it that song?

1914
01:05:50,142 --> 01:05:51,441
(The song stretches on, but these 4 members don't have a clue.)

1915
01:05:51,442 --> 01:05:53,511
- It's such a famous song. - What's this song?

1916
01:05:53,512 --> 01:05:54,882
(The song stretches on, but these 4 members don't have a clue.)

1917
01:05:55,652 --> 01:05:56,912
It's my first time hearing it.

1918
01:05:57,422 --> 01:05:58,951
Isn't it that song?

1919
01:05:58,952 --> 01:06:00,151
Kyung Soo. Kim Bum Soo.

1920
01:06:00,152 --> 01:06:02,551
- Kim Bum Soo's "Miss You." - Is it correct?

1921
01:06:02,552 --> 01:06:04,292
- Correct. - Yes! It's correct!

1922
01:06:04,962 --> 01:06:06,162
That's it.

1923
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:08,731
- Kyung Soo. - That's it.

1924
01:06:08,732 --> 01:06:10,391
(Kyung Soo is exempt from paying.)

1925
01:06:10,392 --> 01:06:11,931
- He has the oomph. - That's right.

1926
01:06:11,932 --> 01:06:13,861
You're good.

1927
01:06:13,862 --> 01:06:15,372
Kyung Soo, I misjudged you.

1928
01:06:16,732 --> 01:06:17,871
Kyung Soo, you're so...

1929
01:06:17,872 --> 01:06:19,341
Kyung Soo, I misjudged you. I'm disappointed.

1930
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:20,841
Many people are good at this. Strangely,

1931
01:06:20,842 --> 01:06:22,611
I don't feel anxious because you're here.

1932
01:06:22,612 --> 01:06:24,141
(Strangely, I don't feel anxious because you're here.)

1933
01:06:24,142 --> 01:06:25,481
- You're here. - What's wrong with me?

1934
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:27,582
- Strangely, I don't feel anxious. - For goodness' sake.

1935
01:06:27,782 --> 01:06:29,051
Hold on.

1936
01:06:29,052 --> 01:06:30,951
Sang Uk, don't stand up as if you were good at this quiz.

1937
01:06:30,952 --> 01:06:32,221
- Will I hear better if I stand up? - I need to hear the song well.

1938
01:06:32,222 --> 01:06:33,951
- Okay. Then I'll stand up too. - I'll stand up and listen.

1939
01:06:33,952 --> 01:06:35,691
- I'm nervous. - It's like "Amazing Saturday."

1940
01:06:35,692 --> 01:06:37,222
- Let's go. - Let's begin.

1941
01:06:37,892 --> 01:06:38,921
Play the song.

1942
01:06:38,922 --> 01:06:42,332
(The 5th song is played in reverse.)

1943
01:06:42,762 --> 01:06:45,162
(What?)

1944
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:48,232
(Tilting his head)

1945
01:06:49,102 --> 01:06:50,202
Let me answer.

1946
01:06:50,702 --> 01:06:51,872
Girls' Generation's "Gee."

1947
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:55,212
(No way)

1948
01:06:55,312 --> 01:06:56,872
- Girls' Generation's "Gee." - Is it incorrect?

1949
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:57,941
Correct.

1950
01:06:57,942 --> 01:06:59,641
(Correct!)

1951
01:06:59,642 --> 01:07:00,952
- Is it correct? - It's correct.

1952
01:07:01,452 --> 01:07:02,812
You're exempt.

1953
01:07:02,912 --> 01:07:04,051
How? Let me hear it again.

1954
01:07:04,052 --> 01:07:05,782
"Gee, gee, gee." I heard that part.

1955
01:07:06,082 --> 01:07:07,792
How? Let me hear it again.

1956
01:07:08,322 --> 01:07:09,452
How?

1957
01:07:12,022 --> 01:07:14,261
(The "Gee, gee, gee" part didn't get played, )

1958
01:07:14,262 --> 01:07:16,462
(but he answered correctly.)

1959
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:29,541
We're definitely escaping in the order of our skills.

1960
01:07:29,542 --> 01:07:30,881
You're right.

1961
01:07:30,882 --> 01:07:32,381
Only the two of them remain.

1962
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:33,841
I really can't do this.

1963
01:07:33,842 --> 01:07:35,851
- How are you guys so good at it? - Do you listen to music all day?

1964
01:07:35,852 --> 01:07:37,351
- Seriously. Poong. - For goodness' sake.

1965
01:07:37,352 --> 01:07:38,451
- Be loyal, okay? - For goodness' sake.

1966
01:07:38,452 --> 01:07:39,452
- You too. - Poong.

1967
01:07:39,453 --> 01:07:40,781
It's a 1-on-1 match. He can't be loyal.

1968
01:07:40,782 --> 01:07:41,851
- Be loyal. - I mean...

1969
01:07:41,852 --> 01:07:42,991
- Don't worry. - No.

1970
01:07:42,992 --> 01:07:44,821
- I really don't know. - I really don't know.

1971
01:07:44,822 --> 01:07:45,891
It's really hard.

1972
01:07:45,892 --> 01:07:46,961
How will I answer correctly?

1973
01:07:46,962 --> 01:07:48,531
- Take a seat. - Will I hear better if I sit down?

1974
01:07:48,532 --> 01:07:49,591
- Two members remain. - Okay.

1975
01:07:49,592 --> 01:07:51,231
- I can sit down now. - It's hard.

1976
01:07:51,232 --> 01:07:52,361
We found the next question easy...

1977
01:07:52,362 --> 01:07:53,861
when we ran a simulation.

1978
01:07:53,862 --> 01:07:55,271
- Okay. - It's an easy one.

1979
01:07:55,272 --> 01:07:56,601
- You can answer correctly. - Good.

1980
01:07:56,602 --> 01:07:57,742
Let's begin.

1981
01:07:58,072 --> 01:08:03,312
(Who will pay in the end?)

1982
01:08:04,072 --> 01:08:06,842
(Focused)

1983
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:13,230
(Who will pay in the end?)

1984
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:14,929
Come on.

1985
01:08:14,930 --> 01:08:15,960
(Focused)

1986
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:18,870
I know! Kim Poong!

1987
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:21,069
I don't know.

1988
01:08:21,070 --> 01:08:22,099
Lee Hyo Ri's "10 Minutes."

1989
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,669
(Lee Hyo Ri's "10 Minutes!")

1990
01:08:23,670 --> 01:08:24,709
Correct.

1991
01:08:24,710 --> 01:08:26,570
(Correct!)

1992
01:08:26,670 --> 01:08:28,540
Just 1 10 minutes

1993
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:31,850
- I really can't do this. - No way.

1994
01:08:32,110 --> 01:08:33,850
- The experienced one lost. - I really can't do this.

1995
01:08:34,380 --> 01:08:36,220
Dong Hyun, you've done this for years.

1996
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:40,120
- Okay. - I'll live with only athletes.

1997
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:42,719
I'm the smartest one among them.

1998
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,859
I...

1999
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:45,559
We use this card without fail...

2000
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,929
- every week. - That's right.

2001
01:08:46,930 --> 01:08:47,959
- Dong Hyun's and mine... - Dong Hyun,

2002
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,699
- appear every week. - just leave it with the producer.

2003
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:51,400
Seriously. He should leave it with the producer.

2004
01:08:51,500 --> 01:08:52,529
Thank you for the food.

2005
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:54,429
- Thank you. Did you enjoy it? - Yes.

2006
01:08:54,430 --> 01:08:55,769
(Total: 128.2 dollars)

2007
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:58,570
- I was chosen to pay. - The total is 128.2 dollars.

2008
01:08:58,670 --> 01:09:00,439
I always pay with this card.

2009
01:09:00,440 --> 01:09:01,710
- Thank you. - Okay.

2010
01:09:02,480 --> 01:09:03,580
The card feels hot...

2011
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:05,009
because it's always used to pay.

2012
01:09:05,010 --> 01:09:06,780
(The card feels hot because it's always used to pay.)

2013
01:09:07,150 --> 01:09:09,249
(The scorching sun goes down...)

2014
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:11,190
(and the evening comes.)

2015
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:12,719
("What shall I eat for dinner tonight?")

2016
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:15,690
(A place that's visited by people who are torn)

2017
01:09:16,260 --> 01:09:19,760
(Jeongja Station's Food Alley)

2018
01:09:19,930 --> 01:09:21,360
(Salt-grilled meat)

2019
01:09:21,530 --> 01:09:25,100
(It's filled with customers until late at night.)

2020
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:27,569
(What will the members have for dinner here?)

2021
01:09:27,570 --> 01:09:29,269
I think this is the main street.

2022
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:31,139
This is the Jeongja Station.

2023
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:32,409
We're right in front of the station.

2024
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:34,680
Restaurants are concentrated in this area.

2025
01:09:34,780 --> 01:09:36,080
Everything looks delicious.

2026
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:38,580
- Let's enter through here. - Here.

2027
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:40,809
Which way is it? Is it this way?

2028
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:41,920
It must be upstairs.

2029
01:09:42,580 --> 01:09:44,120
- It's on the second floor. - The second floor.

2030
01:09:44,550 --> 01:09:45,949
This restaurant specializes in seasonal dishes.

2031
01:09:45,950 --> 01:09:47,860
(Located in the main street of the Food Alley...)

2032
01:09:48,020 --> 01:09:50,489
(is a South Jeolla restaurant that's popular for team dinners.)

2033
01:09:50,490 --> 01:09:52,960
(South Jeolla's seasonal dishes)

2034
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:58,230
(Fresh seafood from South Jeolla Province...)

2035
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:00,770
(and the owner's cooking skills meet...)

2036
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:07,010
(and give a feast of South Jeolla dishes.)

2037
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:09,839
(The restaurant is full of customers having a team dinner...)

2038
01:10:09,840 --> 01:10:12,010
(from day to night.)

2039
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:18,720
(Their South Jeolla dishes captivated the customers' tastes.)

2040
01:10:20,950 --> 01:10:23,859
When I eat pike conger shabu shabu, it settles my stomach.

2041
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:24,959
That's why I visit often.

2042
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:27,159
I've come here often for a team dinner.

2043
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:30,130
It's also a nice restaurant to visit with the family.

2044
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:36,370
(DMR, South Jeolla's seasonal dishes)

2045
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:38,069
- Hello. - Hello.

2046
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:39,910
It's an honor to have you guys here.

2047
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:41,840
- Thank you. - Hello.

2048
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:44,439
Does this restaurant specialize in the South Jeolla's dishes?

2049
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,449
Yes.

2050
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:48,719
My husband and I are from Jeolla Province.

2051
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:50,780
I'm from Chunhyanggol, North Jeolla Province.

2052
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,019
- Chunhyanggol? - Yes.

2053
01:10:52,020 --> 01:10:53,349
- Namwon? - Namwon.

2054
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:54,590
Namwon? I see.

2055
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:57,390
We come from the head families.

2056
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:00,360
- I ate a lot of food in childhood. - You cooked a lot of dishes.

2057
01:11:00,630 --> 01:11:02,260
That's why I like to cook.

2058
01:11:02,730 --> 01:11:05,529
Do the ingredients come from Jeolla Province?

2059
01:11:05,530 --> 01:11:07,330
- They come from Jeolla Province. - Really?

2060
01:11:07,570 --> 01:11:09,039
Brown croaker comes...

2061
01:11:09,040 --> 01:11:10,500
from Imja Island, Mokpo.

2062
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:13,209
- Pike conger comes from Yeosu. - Yeosu.

2063
01:11:13,210 --> 01:11:15,540
- Seasonal food gets shipped here. - Yes.

2064
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:18,149
- Would you recommend some menus? - What should we eat?

2065
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:19,309
We have deokja.

2066
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:20,749
- That's right. Deokja. - Have you heard of deokja?

2067
01:11:20,750 --> 01:11:22,419
- What's deokja? - Tell us.

2068
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:23,619
- Simply put, - I haven't had it.

2069
01:11:23,620 --> 01:11:26,220
Deokja is a big-sized silver pomfret.

2070
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:27,990
- Is it a silver pomfret? - Yes.

2071
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,620
We make sashimi with the fatty part.

2072
01:11:30,690 --> 01:11:33,029
- With the belly? - Yes. Eat the belly as sashimi...

2073
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:35,199
and the back as a braised dish.

2074
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:37,160
- That sounds lovely. - That sounds lovely.

2075
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:38,630
In that case,

2076
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:40,299
I have a suggestion.

2077
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:43,269
There's the silver pomfret set with the sashimi and braised dish.

2078
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:45,039
Let's order a few servings of that...

2079
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:46,469
- and pike conger shabu shabu. - That's right.

2080
01:11:46,470 --> 01:11:47,909
- It's neat. - It's neat.

2081
01:11:47,910 --> 01:11:50,409
Okay. It's rare for us to agree on the order so quickly.

2082
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:51,779
- I'll prepare the dishes. - Okay.

2083
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:53,749
Maybe we'll need more food.

2084
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:54,880
I can't imagine it.

2085
01:11:55,080 --> 01:11:56,719
Let's decide as we eat.

2086
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,150
We can always order more.

2087
01:11:58,420 --> 01:11:59,490
Here comes the food.

2088
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:01,089
We'll get a table full of food.

2089
01:12:01,090 --> 01:12:03,019
You can tell if the restaurant is good...

2090
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:04,120
by trying the side dishes.

2091
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:05,759
(The side dishes will be revealed.)

2092
01:12:05,760 --> 01:12:06,889
The salted seafood is incredible.

2093
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:08,330
(The side dishes will be revealed.)

2094
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:10,660
Take a look at the color of this kimchi.

2095
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:12,229
- It's aged kimchi. - Yes.

2096
01:12:12,230 --> 01:12:13,369
(The color of the aged kimchi looks incredible.)

2097
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:14,569
This kimchi looks amazing.

2098
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:15,870
(This kimchi looks amazing.)

2099
01:12:16,100 --> 01:12:17,169
(Silver pomfret sashimi enters.)

2100
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:18,209
- What's this? - This is insane.

2101
01:12:18,210 --> 01:12:19,270
What's this?

2102
01:12:19,540 --> 01:12:20,569
Look at that.

2103
01:12:20,570 --> 01:12:21,709
It looks beautiful.

2104
01:12:21,710 --> 01:12:23,240
My eyes are fixed on it.

2105
01:12:23,510 --> 01:12:26,009
(The fattiest part of the silver pomfret, belly, )

2106
01:12:26,010 --> 01:12:28,480
(is sliced thinly.)

2107
01:12:29,780 --> 01:12:33,390
(Then the outer membrane and the bones are removed.)

2108
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:37,520
(Then the pieces are plated nicely in the shape of giyeok!)

2109
01:12:38,330 --> 01:12:42,130
(Silver pomfret sashimi has the fatty and savory taste.)

2110
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:43,760
What's this sauce?

2111
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:44,800
It's a sauce for the silver pomfret.

2112
01:12:45,770 --> 01:12:46,799
I've never seen this combination.

2113
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,570
It'll be the nuttiest sauce.

2114
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,340
- I'll explain how you can enjoy it. - Okay.

2115
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:53,610
How do we eat it?
(Curious)

2116
01:12:54,611 --> 01:12:56,079
Underneath here...

2117
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:57,539
- are perilla leaves. - Okay.

2118
01:12:57,540 --> 01:13:00,209
They look like spring cabbage, but they're ssamchu.

2119
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:01,679
- Ssamchu? - Ssamchu.

2120
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,679
- Turn over ssamchu. - Napa cabbage and lettuce.

2121
01:13:03,680 --> 01:13:05,449
- Turn it over. - Okay.

2122
01:13:05,450 --> 01:13:07,689
- And... - You take a piece.

2123
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:08,989
Dip it in sesame oil.

2124
01:13:08,990 --> 01:13:10,120
(Dip silver pomfret sashimi in sesame oil.)

2125
01:13:10,620 --> 01:13:13,160
Then add a bit of doenjang. Afterward,

2126
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:16,260
- you add salted hairtail innards, - You add many things.

2127
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:18,270
A piece of chili pepper, and a piece of garlic.

2128
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:21,030
- There's rice here, right? - Do you add rice?

2129
01:13:21,640 --> 01:13:22,740
You add a bit of rice too.

2130
01:13:23,370 --> 01:13:25,370
- You just need to add a bit. - A bit of rice.

2131
01:13:25,810 --> 01:13:27,069
That's how you make a wrap.

2132
01:13:27,070 --> 01:13:28,109
(You can enjoy your silver pomfret sashimi now.)

2133
01:13:28,110 --> 01:13:29,309
- We'll try it. - My goodness.

2134
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:30,809
- Go ahead and eat. - Go ahead and eat.

2135
01:13:30,810 --> 01:13:32,179
- She taught us what to do. - Enjoy the food.

2136
01:13:32,180 --> 01:13:33,580
- Okay. Bye. - Thank you.

2137
01:13:35,380 --> 01:13:37,319
(How will it taste?)

2138
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:38,350
Is it tasty? How is it?

2139
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:45,090
(The body language of happiness)

2140
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:46,929
(Dong Hyun also eats a silver pomfret sashimi wrap!)

2141
01:13:46,930 --> 01:13:47,930
It isn't spicy.

2142
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:49,530
You know,

2143
01:13:50,230 --> 01:13:52,570
it cuts down on the greasiness.

2144
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,969
(The savory flavors of the silver pomfret sashimi...)

2145
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:58,970
(spread in the mouth as you chew it.)

2146
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:02,109
(Poong enjoys a wrap as well.)

2147
01:14:02,110 --> 01:14:03,880
- Really? Shall I eat it? - Go ahead and eat.

2148
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:06,849
- Shall I eat it? - Go ahead and eat.

2149
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:08,449
(Kyung Soo enjoys a silver pomfret sashimi wrap.)

2150
01:14:08,450 --> 01:14:10,480
- Thank you, silver pomfret. - This is...

2151
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:14,390
Thank you, silver pomfret.

2152
01:14:14,391 --> 01:14:15,559
(He thanks the silver pomfret for the wrap.)

2153
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:16,620
A shout-out to the silver pomfret.

2154
01:14:18,460 --> 01:14:22,560
(He fills his mouth with a silver pomfret sashimi wrap.)

2155
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:28,570
(Bravo, silver pomfret sashimi.)

2156
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:30,900
(It gets two thumbs up.)

2157
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:34,469
Since it's a summer silver pomfret,

2158
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:36,539
the bones are very soft. When you chew them,

2159
01:14:36,540 --> 01:14:38,180
they go down easily.

2160
01:14:38,250 --> 01:14:40,250
They're like soft cartilage.

2161
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:42,520
There's a bit of texture.

2162
01:14:43,480 --> 01:14:46,120
(Silver pomfret sashimi has an incredible texture.)

2163
01:14:46,550 --> 01:14:47,619
(Silver pomfret sashimi has one more charm.)

2164
01:14:47,620 --> 01:14:49,920
Since it's fatty,

2165
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:52,790
I feel like I'm chewing on butter.

2166
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:55,860
- Juice comes out when I chew it. - That's right.

2167
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,170
- It's because it's fatty. - It's fatty.

2168
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:00,829
You almost feel like you're eating raw pork belly.

2169
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:02,769
That's how fatty it is.

2170
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:04,299
(Silver pomfret sashimi has the fattiness of red meat.)

2171
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:06,709
The combination of sesame oil, doenjang,

2172
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:08,010
and salted hairtail innards is the best.

2173
01:15:08,140 --> 01:15:09,880
The three of them harmonize so well.

2174
01:15:10,540 --> 01:15:11,879
Sesame oil and this doenjang.

2175
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,279
It's light doenjang.

2176
01:15:13,280 --> 01:15:14,509
It's such a delicacy.

2177
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:15,520
(The silver pomfret wrap is perfect with its harmony of flavors.)

2178
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:18,649
Why is it my first time eating the silver pomfret sashimi?

2179
01:15:18,650 --> 01:15:19,819
I know. It's so tasty.

2180
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:20,919
- Is it your first time? - Yes, it's my first time.

2181
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:21,990
It's my first time.

2182
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:23,320
It's so tasty.

2183
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,930
It's seriously tasty.

2184
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:29,360
- It's an honest reaction. - Yes.

2185
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:31,730
Soju is here. It's the perfect timing.

2186
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:34,170
- You have to add rice. - Thank you.

2187
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:37,240
Just the three of us?

2188
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:39,639
- It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you.

2189
01:15:39,640 --> 01:15:40,710
Enjoy the food.

2190
01:15:44,180 --> 01:15:45,180
Oh, my.

2191
01:15:45,181 --> 01:15:46,349
(They fall for the taste of silver pomfret sashimi.)

2192
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:47,410
It's fresh.

2193
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:49,550
- It's sweet. - Right?

2194
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:52,149
I'm moved by the taste.

2195
01:15:52,150 --> 01:15:56,260
(The signature menu, pike conger shabu shabu)

2196
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:59,560
(Pike conger from Yeosu has a clean taste and nice texture.)

2197
01:16:02,030 --> 01:16:03,060
It's like medicine.

2198
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:04,859
The broth looks amazing.

2199
01:16:04,860 --> 01:16:07,969
(The broth is healthy and tasty...)

2200
01:16:07,970 --> 01:16:11,040
(thanks to the medicinal ingredients such and ginseng and jujube.)

2201
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:17,140
(He tries the broth first.)

2202
01:16:17,580 --> 01:16:19,479
What? It's like medicine. It's like samgyetang.

2203
01:16:19,480 --> 01:16:21,010
Seriously. It's like samgyetang.

2204
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:22,519
Let me explain something...

2205
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:23,649
- before I go. - Okay.

2206
01:16:23,650 --> 01:16:25,389
Here comes the explanation. We need to listen carefully.

2207
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:26,390
- Listen carefully. - Listen carefully.

2208
01:16:26,391 --> 01:16:27,419
(Expectant)

2209
01:16:27,420 --> 01:16:30,319
- Take a perilla leaf... - A perilla leaf.

2210
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:31,390
And blanch it.

2211
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:33,960
- Blanch a perilla leaf. - That's right.

2212
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,599
Dip it in the broth.

2213
01:16:35,600 --> 01:16:36,600
Blanch it.

2214
01:16:36,601 --> 01:16:38,160
Add this much chive.

2215
01:16:38,700 --> 01:16:40,099
- Grab this much. - Okay.

2216
01:16:40,100 --> 01:16:42,439
- Grab this much. - Then comes the pike conger.

2217
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:44,339
- With the chive inside... - On top of the chive.

2218
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:45,510
(I see!)

2219
01:16:45,640 --> 01:16:47,910
You roll it up when you put it in the broth.

2220
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:50,709
- Like this. - That's right.

2221
01:16:50,710 --> 01:16:51,710
(They roll up the pike conger like the owner.)

2222
01:16:51,810 --> 01:16:52,849
- You know, - When it's like this...

2223
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:55,379
- it took longer than I expected. - Yes.

2224
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:56,980
Yes. Cook it like this.

2225
01:16:57,420 --> 01:16:59,749
Now, this is aged mustard greens kimchi.

2226
01:16:59,750 --> 01:17:02,719
- It's aged mustard greens kimchi. - Aged mustard greens kimchi.

2227
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:03,819
It's in front of you.

2228
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:04,859
- And... - Yes.

2229
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:06,229
(The ingredient that'll provide a kick...)

2230
01:17:06,230 --> 01:17:07,630
(to the pike conger shabu shabu, mustard greens kimchi)

2231
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:10,129
- Okay. I'm adding the kimchi. - Here.

2232
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:11,229
- It's here. - Adding too much...

2233
01:17:11,230 --> 01:17:12,299
will make it salty.

2234
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:14,269
- Add just a little bit. - Add just a little bit.

2235
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:16,269
- This will be enough. - A little bit.

2236
01:17:16,270 --> 01:17:19,609
- Now, salted hairtail innards. - Add salted hairtail innards.

2237
01:17:19,610 --> 01:17:21,740
- Welcome, salted hairtail innards. - Salted hairtail innards.

2238
01:17:22,110 --> 01:17:23,280
"Welcome."

2239
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:25,479
(Salted hairtail innards are here.)

2240
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:27,450
- Now, you can eat it. - Okay.

2241
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,479
- Don't add rice. Eat it like this. - Don't add rice.

2242
01:17:29,480 --> 01:17:31,849
- Okay. Salted hairtail innards. - Okay.

2243
01:17:31,850 --> 01:17:33,219
It's going in.

2244
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:35,060
(Pike conger shabu shabu is going in.)

2245
01:17:35,260 --> 01:17:37,689
(It's going in.)

2246
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:39,160
Do you see the onion?

2247
01:17:39,830 --> 01:17:41,029
Let's go.

2248
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:44,460
(Let's eat it.)

2249
01:17:44,930 --> 01:17:48,640
(Chewing the food makes their eyes go wide.)

2250
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:53,940
(They receive the signal of the pike conger shabu shabu.)

2251
01:17:55,810 --> 01:17:59,880
(The taste makes them exclaim.)

2252
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:01,649
Aged mustard greens kimchi is amazing.

2253
01:18:01,650 --> 01:18:02,719
Is it from Yeosu?

2254
01:18:02,720 --> 01:18:04,950
It was made with mustard greens from nature.

2255
01:18:05,220 --> 01:18:07,589
It tastes like kimchi stew.

2256
01:18:07,590 --> 01:18:09,060
- If it's hot... - Seriously.

2257
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:10,290
Stir-fried kimchi.

2258
01:18:10,420 --> 01:18:11,560
This is tasty.

2259
01:18:12,330 --> 01:18:15,099
I'll explain one more method before I go.

2260
01:18:15,100 --> 01:18:16,159
Okay.

2261
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:18,570
Next comes the variation.

2262
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:21,229
- It's an onion. - You see the onion, right?

2263
01:18:21,230 --> 01:18:22,540
Onion. Okay.

2264
01:18:23,270 --> 01:18:25,769
- There's a red onion. - Yes. There's a red onion.

2265
01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:27,769
- Add it here. - Add it.

2266
01:18:27,770 --> 01:18:30,539
- Do the same as before. - Do the same. Add the chive.

2267
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:32,049
- Do the same and add the chive. - Do the same.

2268
01:18:32,050 --> 01:18:33,479
- Do the same. - Add the pike conger.

2269
01:18:33,480 --> 01:18:35,420
- Pike conger is going in. - Enter the water.

2270
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,119
Put it in a piece of onion.

2271
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,389
It's like a boat.

2272
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:39,819
(Place it on top of the red onion!)

2273
01:18:39,820 --> 01:18:40,990
What should we add next?

2274
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:44,359
- There's ssamjang, right? - Yes.

2275
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,689
You can add it.

2276
01:18:45,690 --> 01:18:47,890
Okay. Welcome, ssamjang.

2277
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,730
(Laughing)

2278
01:18:50,930 --> 01:18:52,230
(Doenjang and ssamjang are here.)

2279
01:18:52,430 --> 01:18:55,069
(I'm pike conger shabu shabu featuring red onion.)

2280
01:18:55,070 --> 01:18:57,169
- Yes. - I'll get going now.

2281
01:18:57,170 --> 01:18:58,639
- Thank you. - Enjoy the food.

2282
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,170
- We'll begin eating now. - Okay.

2283
01:19:00,240 --> 01:19:01,409
Let's go.

2284
01:19:01,410 --> 01:19:03,339
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2285
01:19:03,340 --> 01:19:04,409
(Men's pike conger shabu shabu)

2286
01:19:04,410 --> 01:19:07,249
- Let's go. - Let's go.

2287
01:19:07,250 --> 01:19:09,380
(Let's go.)

2288
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:14,090
(Here comes the eating show of pike conger shabu shabu.)

2289
01:19:16,760 --> 01:19:20,830
(The younger ones become embarrassed.)

2290
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:23,600
(Handsome Guys take over the pike conger shabu shabu.)

2291
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:27,470
(It's tasty indeed.)

2292
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:31,810
(Pike conger is the best.)

2293
01:19:31,910 --> 01:19:33,239
Here I go.

2294
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:34,370
(Here goes the younger member.)

2295
01:19:34,810 --> 01:19:39,680
(He fills his mouth with pike conger shabu shabu.)

2296
01:19:42,850 --> 01:19:44,050
Here I go.

2297
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:46,890
The onion is really tasty.

2298
01:19:47,450 --> 01:19:50,219
- The onion is really sweet. - The red onion is really sweet.

2299
01:19:50,220 --> 01:19:52,889
(The sweet red onion elevates the taste of the shabu shabu.)

2300
01:19:52,890 --> 01:19:55,029
- What a combination. - It's insane.

2301
01:19:55,030 --> 01:19:56,929
It's hard to believe that there's fish inside.

2302
01:19:56,930 --> 01:19:58,299
- I know. - Seriously.

2303
01:19:58,300 --> 01:19:59,569
It's so juicy.

2304
01:19:59,570 --> 01:20:01,169
The fish is firm.

2305
01:20:01,170 --> 01:20:04,440
(Pike conger gives a firm texture and juice.)

2306
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,410
Tae Hyun, how shall we eat it next?

2307
01:20:06,640 --> 01:20:08,409
- Please make a decision. - Please make a decision.

2308
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:10,279
Onion or perilla leaf?

2309
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:11,679
I prefer the perilla leaf.

2310
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,649
- Okay. - This time, it's the perilla leaf.

2311
01:20:13,650 --> 01:20:14,680
(He wants the version with the perilla leaf.)

2312
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:16,279
Let's go!

2313
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:18,049
Tae Hyun prefers the perilla leaf.

2314
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:19,950
Let's go with the perilla leaf.

2315
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,749
Let's go with the perilla leaf.

2316
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:23,020
(They ready a perilla leaf.)

2317
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,290
- We'll enjoy the food, Tae Hyun. - All right. Eat up.

2318
01:20:27,460 --> 01:20:29,000
This will be the last eating show.

2319
01:20:29,300 --> 01:20:31,499
Mustard greens kimchi provides a kick.

2320
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:33,370
That's right. You'll be surprised by the mustard greens kimchi.

2321
01:20:33,870 --> 01:20:36,899
Mustard greens kimchi is a work of art. You should add a lot.

2322
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:38,100
You'll be surprised by the mustard greens kimchi.

2323
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:41,340
(It goes straight into his mouth.)

2324
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,479
Aren't we eating it together this time?

2325
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,879
- Tae Hyun. - Tae Hyun.

2326
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:47,849
- Why did you eat first? - I'm upset.

2327
01:20:47,850 --> 01:20:49,849
I thought you wanted to say, "Let's do this."

2328
01:20:49,850 --> 01:20:52,519
- Did I say that? - Tae Hyun.

2329
01:20:52,520 --> 01:20:54,089
- Tae Hyun. - Let's get up from our seats.

2330
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:55,759
Hold on.

2331
01:20:55,760 --> 01:20:57,890
Gosh, I received a call.

2332
01:20:58,490 --> 01:21:00,229
(Who is it?)

2333
01:21:00,230 --> 01:21:02,559
- Hello. - I didn't know that you had called.

2334
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,960
It's okay. Hello.

2335
01:21:05,300 --> 01:21:07,369
- Hello. - Bo Young, your brother,

2336
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:08,469
Kyung Soo...

2337
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:10,640
(Actress Park Bo Young)

2338
01:21:10,700 --> 01:21:12,469
- Yes. Is he doing well? - Yes, he's doing well.

2339
01:21:12,470 --> 01:21:14,769
Kyung Soo is very drunk.

2340
01:21:14,770 --> 01:21:15,910
That isn't true.

2341
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:18,109
Can you drink on that show?

2342
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:19,910
Yes, we can drink on this show.

2343
01:21:20,150 --> 01:21:22,279
Kyung Soo can hold his liquor.

2344
01:21:22,280 --> 01:21:24,950
He's drinking well. Kyung Soo is doing well.

2345
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:27,189
Thank goodness.

2346
01:21:27,190 --> 01:21:29,419
- Kyung Soo was very worried. - I know.

2347
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:31,559
Kyung Soo, talk to her.

2348
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:32,689
Wait.

2349
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:33,990
Bbovely, I'm doing well.

2350
01:21:34,890 --> 01:21:37,259
- Good luck with the shoot. - Your voice sounds fine.

2351
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,930
I'm completely wasted.

2352
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:40,930
- What? - I'm joking.

2353
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:43,199
(Will he wrap up the call that way?)

2354
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:44,200
"I'm joking."

2355
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:46,969
- Why did you use a nickname? - Seriously.

2356
01:21:46,970 --> 01:21:49,309
- I call her Bbovely often. - Bbovely.

2357
01:21:49,310 --> 01:21:51,579
He calls me Bbovely without any emotions.

2358
01:21:51,580 --> 01:21:53,379
My goodness.

2359
01:21:53,380 --> 01:21:56,549
All right. Bo Young, good luck with the shoot.

2360
01:21:56,550 --> 01:21:58,620
Shouldn't we have a popularity vote?

2361
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:01,220
- Take care. - Okay. Bye.

2362
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:02,360
Forget it.

2363
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:04,219
Forget it. All right.

2364
01:22:04,220 --> 01:22:06,229
- All right. - Okay. Let's do...

2365
01:22:06,230 --> 01:22:08,929
Let's do the wave.

2366
01:22:08,930 --> 01:22:12,429
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

2367
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:13,530
Let's do this.

2368
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:17,000
(Laughing)

2369
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:18,170
(Impressed)

2370
01:22:18,171 --> 01:22:20,469
Let's go.

2371
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:22,740
(They do the wave with the pike conger shabu shabu.)

2372
01:22:22,910 --> 01:22:25,610
The aged kimchi tastes amazing.

2373
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,309
(Savoring the amazing taste)

2374
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:28,920
I bet it's tasty as it is.

2375
01:22:31,420 --> 01:22:35,860
(Let's have some pike conger shabu shabu tonight.)

2376
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:37,560
(The next dish enters.)

2377
01:22:37,561 --> 01:22:39,289
- It has bracken in it. - Gosh.

2378
01:22:39,290 --> 01:22:40,430
(Amazed)

2379
01:22:40,590 --> 01:22:41,789
It has bracken in it.

2380
01:22:41,790 --> 01:22:43,600
It's unique how it has bracken in it.

2381
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:45,530
That's unique about it.

2382
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:48,070
It's my first time seeing bracken in a braised dish.

2383
01:22:48,740 --> 01:22:50,039
(The thick and plump silver pomfret is being braised nicely.)

2384
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:51,640
The silver pomfret has a lot of meat.

2385
01:22:52,110 --> 01:22:53,210
There's a lot of meat.

2386
01:22:56,840 --> 01:22:57,980
Check out the bracken.

2387
01:22:59,210 --> 01:23:02,750
(Yi Kyung gets the bracken and silver pomfret.)

2388
01:23:03,350 --> 01:23:05,649
(Sang Uk gets a piece of the silver pomfret too.)

2389
01:23:05,650 --> 01:23:06,850
There's so much meat.

2390
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:08,590
Gosh, it looks amazing.

2391
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:11,820
(And on top of that, )

2392
01:23:12,230 --> 01:23:16,660
(he gets a scoop of the sweet broth.)

2393
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:18,700
This is great.

2394
01:23:19,200 --> 01:23:20,370
It's bubbling up.

2395
01:23:20,870 --> 01:23:22,069
(Taking a bite of the braised silver pomfret)

2396
01:23:22,070 --> 01:23:23,400
It'll be great with some makgeolli.

2397
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:26,939
(Writer Poong also starts with the silver pomfret too.)

2398
01:23:26,940 --> 01:23:27,970
- Thank you. - Gosh!

2399
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:29,879
The meat is insane.

2400
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,480
Since the silver pomfret is big,

2401
01:23:32,910 --> 01:23:34,709
it looks thin, but it's actually very plump.

2402
01:23:34,710 --> 01:23:36,280
There's so much meat.

2403
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:38,220
Check this out.

2404
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:39,789
It looks like the meat of a cod.

2405
01:23:39,790 --> 01:23:41,250
Even half of it is this big.

2406
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:43,360
It's definitely a big silver pomfret.

2407
01:23:43,720 --> 01:23:46,029
Regular silver pomfret is good,

2408
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:47,759
but there are times when the meat lacks a bit.

2409
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:48,860
This has so much meat though.

2410
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:50,730
This is really good.

2411
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:57,270
(This is it.)

2412
01:23:57,640 --> 01:23:59,910
You can tell once you try the broth.

2413
01:24:01,370 --> 01:24:02,639
(Taking a sip of the broth)

2414
01:24:02,640 --> 01:24:03,940
Everything is good.

2415
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:06,850
(Acknowledging the braised dish)

2416
01:24:07,210 --> 01:24:10,180
(Seung Ho drinks the broth too.)

2417
01:24:10,820 --> 01:24:11,950
(Satisfied)

2418
01:24:13,190 --> 01:24:14,319
It's so nice.

2419
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,360
(The sweet and red broth that is addicting)

2420
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:18,830
(Taking a bite of the plump silver pomfret)

2421
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:22,100
(Feeling touched again by the meat of the silver pomfret)

2422
01:24:25,530 --> 01:24:27,230
How is the meat so tender?

2423
01:24:27,730 --> 01:24:28,969
It doesn't even crumble.

2424
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:32,610
It also feels like the firm meat...

2425
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:35,640
- of a cod. - It's amazing.

2426
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:39,310
(Greatly satisfied)

2427
01:24:39,510 --> 01:24:42,249
(Finishing up with the rice and broth)

2428
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:43,719
- I should come here separately. - Right.

2429
01:24:43,720 --> 01:24:48,090
(The perfect example of a rice killer)

2430
01:24:49,690 --> 01:24:52,689
I mixed the rice with the broth to finish it up...

2431
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:53,860
and it felt refreshing.

2432
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:56,699
- The braised dish is so good. - It's really good.

2433
01:24:56,700 --> 01:24:58,430
It's insane. The braised dish...

2434
01:24:58,800 --> 01:25:00,170
is the highlight.

2435
01:25:01,730 --> 01:25:03,999
I'm planning to have some makgeolli.

2436
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:05,240
Right now? Go ahead.

2437
01:25:05,510 --> 01:25:06,869
Kyung Soo has something to say.

2438
01:25:06,870 --> 01:25:07,940
- Really? - Yes.

2439
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:10,010
I have something to say to the owner.

2440
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:11,579
Are you going to thank her?

2441
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:12,750
- Say it with confidence. - Thank you.

2442
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:13,810
I see.

2443
01:25:13,811 --> 01:25:15,880
And I would like some makgeolli, please.

2444
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:17,780
Oh, you wanted makgeolli?

2445
01:25:18,450 --> 01:25:20,519
These dishes go well with makgeolli.

2446
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:21,620
He's pairing it with these dishes.

2447
01:25:22,190 --> 01:25:23,460
Makgeolli is a must.

2448
01:25:25,390 --> 01:25:26,829
(The makgeolli you have ordered is here.)

2449
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:27,889
Right.

2450
01:25:27,890 --> 01:25:29,100
Thank you.

2451
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:31,400
Right. You must have makgeolli with a braised dish.

2452
01:25:32,330 --> 01:25:34,770
The meat is so tender.

2453
01:25:34,970 --> 01:25:36,399
- It's here. - It's here.

2454
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,570
(The bill arrives right away!)

2455
01:25:38,500 --> 01:25:39,869
Gosh, it's the number of the beast.

2456
01:25:39,870 --> 01:25:42,039
- This will change the ranks. - Is this from the beast?

2457
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,780
Gosh, how much did we pay?

2458
01:25:44,040 --> 01:25:45,579
- Hold on. - This will change the ranks.

2459
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:46,880
Is this from the beast?

2460
01:25:47,250 --> 01:25:49,980
(Creeped out)

2461
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:52,250
(Curious)

2462
01:25:52,390 --> 01:25:54,190
- This will change things. - It's 666 dollars.

2463
01:25:54,920 --> 01:25:56,119
The number of the beast!

2464
01:25:56,120 --> 01:25:57,690
- It's the number of the beast! - It's 666!

2465
01:25:57,990 --> 01:26:00,890
(Really?)

2466
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:02,560
This doesn't look like 666 to me.

2467
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:04,060
What does it look like to you then?

2468
01:26:04,230 --> 01:26:05,329
Poong, Poong, Poong.

2469
01:26:05,330 --> 01:26:08,170
(Poong, Poong, Poong)

2470
01:26:09,300 --> 01:26:11,099
- Do you have bad eyes? - It's your fate.

2471
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:12,210
Really?

2472
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:13,969
How does that look like that to you?

2473
01:26:13,970 --> 01:26:15,139
I really hope it will end up that way.

2474
01:26:15,140 --> 01:26:16,380
Gosh. Poong, Poong, Poong.

2475
01:26:16,410 --> 01:26:18,210
Are we playing Line Up the Words again?

2476
01:26:18,510 --> 01:26:19,580
Yes.

2477
01:26:19,850 --> 01:26:20,949
Once again,

2478
01:26:20,950 --> 01:26:22,649
will two payments be canceled...

2479
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:24,019
if we make it in the first attempt?

2480
01:26:24,020 --> 01:26:25,549
Yes. Just like last week,

2481
01:26:25,550 --> 01:26:27,089
if you make it in the first attempt,

2482
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:30,219
you can select two payments that have been made earlier...

2483
01:26:30,220 --> 01:26:31,360
to be canceled.

2484
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:33,829
Let's make it in the first attempt.

2485
01:26:33,830 --> 01:26:34,890
Sounds good.

2486
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:37,629
It would be a waste to let Seung Ho answer only once.

2487
01:26:37,630 --> 01:26:39,299
- That's true. - Right.

2488
01:26:39,300 --> 01:26:40,670
Should we switch spots?

2489
01:26:40,870 --> 01:26:42,969
- Let's do that. - That seems like a good idea.

2490
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:44,740
Seung Ho knows a lot.

2491
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:46,769
Seung Ho is really smart.

2492
01:26:46,770 --> 01:26:48,809
- Right. He's clever. - He really is.

2493
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:50,439
He's really intelligent.

2494
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:51,540
(The guy that can be trusted in Handsome Guys, Seung Ho)

2495
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:53,580
Let's answer it once properly, Sang Uk.

2496
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,920
Can you not do it even once?

2497
01:26:56,680 --> 01:26:58,419
- Let's go, Poong. - All right.

2498
01:26:58,420 --> 01:26:59,819
Gosh.

2499
01:26:59,820 --> 01:27:01,150
- Bottoms up. - We can do this.

2500
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:02,789
- Hold on. - Gosh.

2501
01:27:02,790 --> 01:27:03,819
- Hold on. - He said, "Bottoms up."

2502
01:27:03,820 --> 01:27:06,029
Why does he keep saying that?

2503
01:27:06,030 --> 01:27:07,030
- He keeps saying that. - Gosh.

2504
01:27:07,031 --> 01:27:08,959
- I'm going to get upset. - What's wrong?

2505
01:27:08,960 --> 01:27:10,560
Kyung Soo keeps saying...

2506
01:27:10,700 --> 01:27:13,429
He keeps trying to send me away after making me drink.

2507
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:14,800
- He keeps trying to... - Great.

2508
01:27:14,830 --> 01:27:16,300
- He keeps trying to... - You need insurance.

2509
01:27:16,400 --> 01:27:17,640
You need insurance.

2510
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:20,469
Gosh, Kyung Soo. You're a scary person.

2511
01:27:20,470 --> 01:27:22,309
I was a great fan of yours.

2512
01:27:22,310 --> 01:27:23,939
- He was a great fan of yours! - Okay.

2513
01:27:23,940 --> 01:27:25,110
Let's gather up.

2514
01:27:25,410 --> 01:27:26,449
Let's do a chant.

2515
01:27:26,450 --> 01:27:28,009
Let's make it in one attempt.

2516
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:29,619
All right. "Let's go, beggar."

2517
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:30,719
- Right. - Okay.

2518
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:32,520
- "Let's go, beggar." - "Let's go, beggar."

2519
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:36,260
Let's answer it once properly. Can you not do that?

2520
01:27:36,660 --> 01:27:37,820
Here's the first topic.

2521
01:27:38,690 --> 01:27:42,960
Song titles that include...

2522
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:45,159
areas or places in Seoul.

2523
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,169
- What? - Song titles?

2524
01:27:46,170 --> 01:27:47,930
Song titles?

2525
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:50,139
- Song titles? - Seoul?

2526
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,169
- Seoul? - Song titles...

2527
01:27:51,170 --> 01:27:52,969
that include areas in Seoul...

2528
01:27:52,970 --> 01:27:54,240
- Areas in Seoul? - Areas in Seoul?

2529
01:27:54,440 --> 01:27:56,779
Or places in Seoul.

2530
01:27:56,780 --> 01:27:58,410
- Places? - Areas or places.

2531
01:27:59,050 --> 01:28:00,680
- I see. - Places that are in Seoul.

2532
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:03,179
Here are some examples. It could be the name of a town...

2533
01:28:03,180 --> 01:28:04,780
- or building. - What kind of building is there?

2534
01:28:04,950 --> 01:28:07,389
Think about it. There are things like bridges too.

2535
01:28:07,390 --> 01:28:10,060
It's along those lines.

2536
01:28:10,890 --> 01:28:12,329
Okay. Let's go for it.

2537
01:28:12,330 --> 01:28:13,389
- I only have one. - Just go for it.

2538
01:28:13,390 --> 01:28:14,960
- It's along those lines. - Do a hard one.

2539
01:28:15,130 --> 01:28:16,429
I only have one. Go with a difficult answer.

2540
01:28:16,430 --> 01:28:18,600
We'll start in five seconds. Five, four,

2541
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:19,900
- Go with a difficult answer. - three,

2542
01:28:20,300 --> 01:28:22,270
two, one. Let's begin.

2543
01:28:22,740 --> 01:28:23,869
One, two, three.

2544
01:28:23,870 --> 01:28:24,970
- "GANGNAM STYLE." - What?

2545
01:28:25,570 --> 01:28:26,670
What's wrong? Were you going to say that?

2546
01:28:26,740 --> 01:28:27,769
Hey!

2547
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:29,139
- What's so hard about this? - I told you to go with...

2548
01:28:29,140 --> 01:28:30,140
a difficult one!

2549
01:28:30,141 --> 01:28:31,479
What's so hard about this?

2550
01:28:31,480 --> 01:28:33,010
- I said I only knew one. - We'll carry on.

2551
01:28:33,110 --> 01:28:35,250
(Laughing)

2552
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:37,449
(Disappointed)

2553
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:38,879
We have to come this far.

2554
01:28:38,880 --> 01:28:40,349
- We'll carry on. - We have to come this far.

2555
01:28:40,350 --> 01:28:41,389
- We'll carry on. - Hey!

2556
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:42,490
One, two, three.

2557
01:28:42,960 --> 01:28:44,990
"On Top of Yeongdong Bridge."

2558
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:46,990
- "Yanghwa BRDG." - Oh, gosh.

2559
01:28:47,260 --> 01:28:48,489
- Gosh! - What?

2560
01:28:48,490 --> 01:28:49,559
Tae Hyun!

2561
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:50,560
My gosh.

2562
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:51,700
(Fail)

2563
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:52,769
We didn't even get to go.

2564
01:28:52,770 --> 01:28:54,370
- Come on! - Dong Hyun!

2565
01:28:54,770 --> 01:28:55,939
"Yanghwa BRDG."

2566
01:28:55,940 --> 01:28:58,070
- "Gwanghwamun Love Song." - What about you, Sang Uk?

2567
01:28:58,370 --> 01:28:59,909
I was going to do this one.

2568
01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:01,810
"I Can See the Jamsu Bridge Out the Window."

2569
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:04,580
Tae Hyun! You should've gone with a difficult one.

2570
01:29:04,740 --> 01:29:06,279
But...

2571
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:07,910
Hold on. Let's switch spots.

2572
01:29:07,980 --> 01:29:09,549
I'm worse than you.

2573
01:29:09,550 --> 01:29:11,520
- Please. - "GANGNAM STYLE..."

2574
01:29:11,580 --> 01:29:13,289
- "GANGNAM STYLE." - I only had that one.

2575
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:15,490
- I knew a lot of songs. - Really?

2576
01:29:15,820 --> 01:29:17,490
Don't worry.

2577
01:29:17,820 --> 01:29:20,159
- We still have two more attempts... - Right.

2578
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,390
- left for us. - We made it last time.

2579
01:29:21,630 --> 01:29:23,229
- We made it last time. - Let's make it happen again.

2580
01:29:23,230 --> 01:29:24,499
It's okay.

2581
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:25,730
All right. Gather up. Let's do a chant.

2582
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:27,529
- All right. - What will we go with this time?

2583
01:29:27,530 --> 01:29:28,599
Hold on. Don't go with beggar.

2584
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:29,639
- Let's go with something else. - Don't go with beggar.

2585
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:30,869
Beggar feels like bad luck.

2586
01:29:30,870 --> 01:29:32,139
What did we go with last week?

2587
01:29:32,140 --> 01:29:33,539
- "Payment canceled!" - "Payment canceled!"

2588
01:29:33,540 --> 01:29:34,739
- Let's go with that. - "Payment canceled!"

2589
01:29:34,740 --> 01:29:35,939
Let's go with that. One, two, three.

2590
01:29:35,940 --> 01:29:37,109
- Payment canceled! - Payment canceled!

2591
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:38,610
Right. Let's bring back that great moment.

2592
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,010
This topic...

2593
01:29:40,610 --> 01:29:42,780
is names of cities that are in Gyeonggi Province.

2594
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,250
- Okay. - This is a big chance.

2595
01:29:45,850 --> 01:29:46,989
Names of cities in Gyeonggi Province.

2596
01:29:46,990 --> 01:29:48,720
- Okay. - This is a big chance.

2597
01:29:48,890 --> 01:29:50,060
This is a really big chance.

2598
01:29:50,660 --> 01:29:51,920
- We'll begin. - Okay.

2599
01:29:52,430 --> 01:29:53,789
- Here we go. - I'll go with an easy one.

2600
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:54,859
We'll start with Dong Hyun.

2601
01:29:54,860 --> 01:29:56,329
No. I'll go with a difficult answer.

2602
01:29:56,330 --> 01:29:57,500
I'll go with a difficult answer!

2603
01:29:57,930 --> 01:29:59,830
- One, two, three. - Pocheon.

2604
01:30:00,570 --> 01:30:02,400

One, two, three.

2609
01:30:11,010 --> 01:30:12,010

- One, two, three. - Sanbon.

2617
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:26,229
We're doing great.

2618
01:30:26,230 --> 01:30:27,329
(We're doing great.)

2619
01:30:27,330 --> 01:30:28,330
One, two, three.

2620
01:30:28,331 --> 01:30:29,400
Gwacheon.

2621
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:30,600
One, two, three.

2622
01:30:30,601 --> 01:30:32,060
Paju!

2623
01:30:32,230 --> 01:30:33,800
(Did they make it?)

2624
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:35,800
(A burst of dopamine)

2625
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:38,240
- We did it! - San...

2626
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:40,139
- It wasn't me. - San...

2627
01:30:40,140 --> 01:30:41,309
- Sanbon. - Sanbon.

2628
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:42,369
- I did that one. - Sanbon.

2629
01:30:42,370 --> 01:30:43,479
Sanbon?

2630
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:44,679
(It can't be.)

2631
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:45,809
- Oh, please. - There's Sanbon, isn't there?

2632
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:47,210
It must not be a city.

2633
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:48,780
It's a neighborhood.

2634
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:52,550
(Gyeonggi Province, Gunpo City, Sanbon Neighborhood)

2635
01:30:53,450 --> 01:30:54,920
There were so many other cities.

2636
01:30:55,520 --> 01:30:56,719
(Was it really his fate?)

2637
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,060
- Well... - What?

2638
01:30:58,320 --> 01:31:00,460
Well, there's Gapyeong...

2639
01:31:00,690 --> 01:31:02,389
and Yongin too. There were so many other cities.

2640
01:31:02,390 --> 01:31:03,800
Pum...

2641
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,699
(Bursting out in laughter)

2642
01:31:05,700 --> 01:31:06,870
It's fine.

2643
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:09,170
That can happen.

2644
01:31:09,740 --> 01:31:10,740
Well...

2645
01:31:10,741 --> 01:31:12,300
- Writer Poong. - I had five in mind.

2646
01:31:12,910 --> 01:31:14,009
There were so many others.

2647
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:15,010
(Poong, Poong, Poong's fate?)

2648
01:31:15,170 --> 01:31:16,379
(Laughing)

2649
01:31:16,380 --> 01:31:17,739
Namyangju?

2650
01:31:17,740 --> 01:31:19,380
Let's do a short interview.

2651
01:31:19,480 --> 01:31:21,279
Out of so many cities,

2652
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:23,379
what was the reason you named Sanbon as a city?

2653
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:24,819
- Did you live there? - Was it your hometown?

2654
01:31:24,820 --> 01:31:26,349
(Hesitating)

2655
01:31:26,350 --> 01:31:28,920
I believe Sanbon should get promoted to become a city.

2656
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:31,689
I believe that wish that I had inside of me...

2657
01:31:31,690 --> 01:31:33,690
- popped out all of a sudden. - Right.

2658
01:31:34,030 --> 01:31:35,189
Okay.

2659
01:31:35,190 --> 01:31:36,330
That was really close.

2660
01:31:38,800 --> 01:31:39,869
The beggar show.

2661
01:31:39,870 --> 01:31:40,969
(The beggar show of atonement)

2662
01:31:40,970 --> 01:31:41,970
Gosh!

2663
01:31:41,971 --> 01:31:44,340
He's the beggar that performed in Sanbon.

2664
01:31:45,370 --> 01:31:46,510
Gosh, that was hilarious.

2665
01:31:46,670 --> 01:31:48,070
- It's the last attempt. - It's the last attempt, everyone.

2666
01:31:48,110 --> 01:31:49,380
We don't get any payments canceled now.

2667
01:31:49,780 --> 01:31:51,040
- We have to make it. - We have to make it...

2668
01:31:51,310 --> 01:31:52,549
- to avoid paying 666 dollars. - Let's do a chant again.

2669
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:54,049
Let's do a chant.

2670
01:31:54,050 --> 01:31:55,579
We don't get any payments canceled now.

2671
01:31:55,580 --> 01:31:57,349
It'll become a bloodbath if we don't make it this time.

2672
01:31:57,350 --> 01:31:58,350
- Gosh. - Right.

2673
01:31:58,351 --> 01:31:59,749
- What should we go with? - This time,

2674
01:31:59,750 --> 01:32:01,550
how does "666 dollars" sound?

2675
01:32:01,650 --> 01:32:02,789
- Six hundred and sixty-six dollars! - Okay.

2676
01:32:02,790 --> 01:32:03,790
All right. One, two, three.

2677
01:32:03,791 --> 01:32:05,620
- Six hundred and sixty-six dollars! - Six hundred and sixty-six dollars!

2678
01:32:07,190 --> 01:32:08,260
We can do this.

2679
01:32:09,460 --> 01:32:10,499
All right, everyone.

2680
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,030
(The third topic gets revealed.)

2681
01:32:12,260 --> 01:32:14,399
- Please be an easy one. - Start brainstorming.

2682
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:15,600
- Let's go! - This is the last attempt.

2683
01:32:15,700 --> 01:32:17,340
We can do this.

2684
01:32:17,700 --> 01:32:18,900
This topic is...

2685
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:21,869
names of the national team players...

2686
01:32:21,870 --> 01:32:24,639
of the 2002 World CupTournament.

2687
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,049
Okay. I know all of them.

2688
01:32:26,050 --> 01:32:27,149
You know all of them?

2689
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:28,479
- All right. - There were only 18 of them.

2690
01:32:28,480 --> 01:32:29,819
- Hold on. - What about the substitutes?

2691
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:30,820
- Listen to me. - Substitutes are fine.

2692
01:32:30,821 --> 01:32:32,049
They just need to be the players that were in the team.

2693
01:32:32,050 --> 01:32:34,220
Go with the best 11 players that you can remember first.

2694
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,060
Let's go with the easiest ones.

2695
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:37,520
- Let's go with the easiest ones. - Okay.

2696
01:32:37,790 --> 01:32:38,860
Be calm.

2697
01:32:39,430 --> 01:32:41,430
- I'll go with the easiest one. - The easiest one.

2698
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:43,559
And you have to leave the easiest ones for us again.

2699
01:32:43,560 --> 01:32:44,700
Just two.

2700
01:32:45,330 --> 01:32:46,500
Please!

2701
01:32:46,730 --> 01:32:48,529
- We will leave the ace players. - Right.

2702
01:32:48,530 --> 01:32:50,540
- Let's leave the ace players. - Right.

2703
01:32:51,040 --> 01:32:52,169
One, two, three.

2704
01:32:52,170 --> 01:32:53,209
Ahn Jung Hwan.

2705
01:32:53,210 --> 01:32:55,210
- Gosh. - One, two, three.

2706
01:32:55,440 --> 01:32:56,540
Park Ji Sung.

2707
01:32:56,940 --> 01:32:58,239
One, two, three.

2708
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,380
Lee Eul Yong.

2709
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:01,209
One, two, three.

2710
01:33:01,210 --> 01:33:02,280
Lee Chun Soo.

2711
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:03,749
One, two, three.

2712
01:33:03,750 --> 01:33:04,820
Seol Ki Hyeon.

2713
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:06,590
I only know one.

2714
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:08,750
One, two, three.

2715
01:33:08,820 --> 01:33:09,860
Lee Min Sung.

2716
01:33:10,490 --> 01:33:11,559
One, two, three.

2717
01:33:11,560 --> 01:33:12,590
Lee Woon Jae.

2718
01:33:12,830 --> 01:33:13,959
One, two, three.

2719
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:15,060
Kim Byung Ji.

2720
01:33:15,130 --> 01:33:16,130
One, two, three.

2721
01:33:16,131 --> 01:33:17,200
Cha Du Ri.

2722
01:33:17,460 --> 01:33:18,460
One, two, three.

2723
01:33:18,461 --> 01:33:19,570
Choi Yong Soo.

2724
01:33:19,630 --> 01:33:20,669
One, two, three.

2725
01:33:20,670 --> 01:33:21,670
Hwang Sun Hong.

2726
01:33:21,671 --> 01:33:22,900
(They are almost there.)

2727
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,170
One, two, three.

2728
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,209
Hiddink.

2729
01:33:26,210 --> 01:33:28,969
(Did you call for me?)

2730
01:33:28,970 --> 01:33:31,810
(Fail)

2731
01:33:32,380 --> 01:33:34,150
(Devastated)

2732
01:33:34,650 --> 01:33:35,779
Lee Young Pyo!

2733
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:37,080
(Chorongi Lee Young Pyo)

2734
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:38,150
Seol Ki Hyeon!

2735
01:33:38,151 --> 01:33:40,490
(Seol Ki Hyeon was already mentioned.)

2736
01:33:40,550 --> 01:33:42,250
Lee Young Pyo! Number Ten!

2737
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:44,719
- Seol Ki Hyeon. - Was Lee Young Pyo not mentioned?

2738
01:33:44,720 --> 01:33:45,789
He wasn't mentioned!

2739
01:33:45,790 --> 01:33:46,960
(How could I not recall the heroes of 2002?)

2740
01:33:46,990 --> 01:33:48,689
There was Vacuum Cleaner Kim Nam Il too.

2741
01:33:48,690 --> 01:33:50,499
- Right. - How was he not mentioned?

2742
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:52,669
- Hong Myung Bo. - The one with yellow hair.

2743
01:33:52,670 --> 01:33:54,129
Kim Tae Young with his tiger mask.

2744
01:33:54,130 --> 01:33:55,169
Right.

2745
01:33:55,170 --> 01:33:57,770
(Dejected)

2746
01:33:57,840 --> 01:33:59,270
Yoo Sang Chul, Number Six.

2747
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:00,840
Kim Tae Young, Number Seven.

2748
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:02,340
Hong Myung Bo, Number 20.

2749
01:34:03,080 --> 01:34:04,140
So in the end,

2750
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:06,280
the eldest ones each got it wrong once.

2751
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:08,750
I got it right this time.

2752
01:34:09,210 --> 01:34:10,879
Did I get it wrong too? Oh, right.

2753
01:34:10,880 --> 01:34:12,479
You were the first one to get it wrong!

2754
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:14,090
"GANGNAM STYLE."

2755
01:34:14,690 --> 01:34:16,219
(He already forgot about that.)

2756
01:34:16,220 --> 01:34:17,320
That was so close.

2757
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:19,529
- We're on our own now. - Right.

2758
01:34:19,530 --> 01:34:20,960
Let the younger ones sit wherever they want to.

2759
01:34:21,330 --> 01:34:23,059
- Sure. - Sure.

2760
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:24,759
- Sit in the remaining seats. - Choose your seat.

2761
01:34:24,760 --> 01:34:25,799
We'll give up our seats.

2762
01:34:25,800 --> 01:34:27,299
- Should we move over there? - I want to go there.

2763
01:34:27,300 --> 01:34:28,329
Should we?

2764
01:34:28,330 --> 01:34:30,139
My gosh. I'm such a fool.

2765
01:34:30,140 --> 01:34:31,699
We have to play rock-paper-scissors.

2766
01:34:31,700 --> 01:34:33,469
The three of us have to play rock-paper-scissors.

2767
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:34,709
Why play rock-paper-scissors?

2768
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:36,239
- This is an important spot. - Hey!

2769
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:37,509
I'll just sit here.

2770
01:34:37,510 --> 01:34:38,740
No! You can't!

2771
01:34:39,610 --> 01:34:40,709
Tae Hyun!

2772
01:34:40,710 --> 01:34:42,180
- Hey. - Move over there.

2773
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:43,280
Go!

2774
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:45,019
(Sitting in the invisible chair)

2775
01:34:45,020 --> 01:34:46,090
Tae Hyun!

2776
01:34:46,390 --> 01:34:47,919
Hurry up and move over, Tae Hyun!

2777
01:34:47,920 --> 01:34:48,949
- Go! - But...

2778
01:34:48,950 --> 01:34:51,589
there's no consideration of the guest whatsoever.

2779
01:34:51,590 --> 01:34:53,089
I'm a guest, Tae Hyun.

2780
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:54,259
You only need to answer once in that spot.

2781
01:34:54,260 --> 01:34:55,589
- Let's all sit. - I'm a guest.

2782
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:56,799
- What is this? - Just sit together.

2783
01:34:56,800 --> 01:34:58,800
- Don't bring me into this. - Just sit together.

2784
01:34:58,860 --> 01:35:00,430
- Gosh. - Let's go.

2785
01:35:00,500 --> 01:35:01,699
The 3 of us are 1.

2786
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:03,439
- We are 1. - The 3 of us are 1.

2787
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:04,970
Are they lovebugs?

2788
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:07,069
- They're lovebugs. - Hold on.

2789
01:35:07,070 --> 01:35:08,140
Even lovebugs...

2790
01:35:08,540 --> 01:35:10,340
Count us as one person.

2791
01:35:10,510 --> 01:35:12,680
If we have an individual match,

2792
01:35:12,810 --> 01:35:13,849
I am certain...

2793
01:35:13,850 --> 01:35:15,449
that the person in that seat will get caught.

2794
01:35:15,450 --> 01:35:16,780
That person will be the loser.

2795
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:19,389
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Right.

2796
01:35:19,390 --> 01:35:20,689
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

2797
01:35:20,690 --> 01:35:21,890
(A draw with paper)

2798
01:35:21,950 --> 01:35:23,190
They all played the same thing.

2799
01:35:23,790 --> 01:35:24,990
Rock-paper-scissors!

2800
01:35:25,260 --> 01:35:27,230
(They all tie with scissors this time.)

2801
01:35:27,330 --> 01:35:28,889
(Laughing)

2802
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:29,929
Did you plan to do that?

2803
01:35:29,930 --> 01:35:31,500
- How did they play the same thing? - Did you plan to do that?

2804
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:32,699
We know what's next.

2805
01:35:32,700 --> 01:35:34,529
The three of us are just the same.

2806
01:35:34,530 --> 01:35:35,530
We know this is next, right?

2807
01:35:35,531 --> 01:35:36,799
- We know what comes next. - Right.

2808
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,269
- All right. - It'll be rock next.

2809
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:39,569
(Calculating the probabilities quickly)

2810
01:35:39,570 --> 01:35:40,809
- Rock... - Please.

2811
01:35:40,810 --> 01:35:42,170
- Rock-paper-scissors! - Rock-paper-scissors!

2812
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:44,440
(Poong loses.)

2813
01:35:44,610 --> 01:35:47,450
As they said it was going to be rock next,

2814
01:35:47,580 --> 01:35:49,050
he played paper right away.

2815
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:52,450
(Let's see.)

2816
01:35:53,950 --> 01:35:55,419
Would you like to hold onto this?

2817
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:56,619
(Would you like to hold onto this?)

2818
01:35:56,620 --> 01:35:58,419
Hold on, Kyung Soo.

2819
01:35:58,420 --> 01:36:00,289
I'll feel really upset if you continue to be like this.

2820
01:36:00,290 --> 01:36:01,789
Gosh, I'm sorry.

2821
01:36:01,790 --> 01:36:03,499
(Gosh, I'm sorry.)

2822
01:36:03,500 --> 01:36:04,899
It's our first time seeing each other and I'm really upset.

2823
01:36:04,900 --> 01:36:06,100
I just got too excited to be with you.

2824
01:36:06,170 --> 01:36:07,299
- Poong! - He's polite.

2825
01:36:07,300 --> 01:36:09,299
- Have another pleasant glass. - Forget it.

2826
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:10,639
Have another glass.

2827
01:36:10,640 --> 01:36:11,870
Poong!

2828
01:36:11,970 --> 01:36:14,970
(That's nice.)

2829
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:17,440
- This is an intense survival. - Okay.

2830
01:36:17,610 --> 01:36:18,679
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

2831
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:19,809
(The long-awaited individual match for the bill)

2832
01:36:19,810 --> 01:36:23,150
Names of major gold medalists in Korea.

2833
01:36:24,220 --> 01:36:25,220
I don't know many.

2834
01:36:25,221 --> 01:36:26,419
That's including the Winter and Summer Games, right?

2835
01:36:26,420 --> 01:36:27,450
Yes.

2836
01:36:28,090 --> 01:36:29,919
- This is really hard. - Just gold medalists?

2837
01:36:29,920 --> 01:36:31,160
I don't know many.

2838
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:32,659
- I don't have a clue. - Gosh.

2839
01:36:32,660 --> 01:36:35,760
There are only around five people that I know.

2840
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:38,659
(Brainstorming)

2841
01:36:38,660 --> 01:36:40,429
- You can't mention yourself. - Right.

2842
01:36:40,430 --> 01:36:42,000
- Got it. - You can't do that.

2843
01:36:42,330 --> 01:36:43,370
Here we go.

2844
01:36:43,440 --> 01:36:44,470
Please be seated.

2845
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:46,570
We will begin.

2846
01:36:46,640 --> 01:36:48,040
One, two, three.

2847
01:36:48,125 --> 01:36:49,225
Please be seated.

2848
01:36:49,865 --> 01:36:51,324
We will begin.

2849
01:36:51,325 --> 01:36:52,624
One, two, three.

2850
01:36:52,625 --> 01:36:53,695
Kim Yuna.

2851
01:36:53,935 --> 01:36:55,134
One, two, three.

2852
01:36:55,135 --> 01:36:56,305
Oh Sang Uk.

2853
01:36:56,365 --> 01:36:57,965
- One, two, three. - Lee Sang Hwa.

2854
01:36:58,365 --> 01:36:59,434
One, two, three.

2855
01:36:59,435 --> 01:37:00,475
Jang Mi Ran.

2856
01:37:00,605 --> 01:37:01,605
One, two, three.

2857
01:37:01,606 --> 01:37:02,675
Hwang Young Cho.

2858
01:37:02,875 --> 01:37:04,075
One, two, three.

2859
01:37:09,075 --> 01:37:11,444
(He predicted his fate accurately.)

2860
01:37:11,445 --> 01:37:13,054
- What? - Incorrect!

2861
01:37:13,055 --> 01:37:15,015
How can you not answer it once?

2862
01:37:15,255 --> 01:37:17,325
Dong Hyun survived without saying anything.

2863
01:37:17,355 --> 01:37:18,524
(The destined fate)

2864
01:37:18,525 --> 01:37:19,655
- Are you serious? - He froze up just like that.

2865
01:37:20,395 --> 01:37:22,224
- Really? - Poong, Poong, Poong!

2866
01:37:22,225 --> 01:37:23,594
(Here's the Poong, Poong, Poong, bill.)

2867
01:37:23,595 --> 01:37:24,824
So it really was worth...

2868
01:37:24,825 --> 01:37:26,734
Poong, Poong, Poong.

2869
01:37:26,735 --> 01:37:28,995
(So it really was worth Poong, Poong, Poong.)

2870
01:37:29,135 --> 01:37:30,235
It's all your fault!

2871
01:37:30,605 --> 01:37:32,974
Kyung Soo!

2872
01:37:32,975 --> 01:37:34,905
You set things up!

2873
01:37:35,175 --> 01:37:37,845
I ended up like this all because of you!

2874
01:37:38,105 --> 01:37:40,945
(Laughing)

2875
01:37:41,315 --> 01:37:42,475
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2876
01:37:44,245 --> 01:37:45,714
Why are you the one to drink?

2877
01:37:45,715 --> 01:37:46,785
(Why are you the one to drink?)

2878
01:37:47,085 --> 01:37:49,955
As soon as we heard about the beggar,

2879
01:37:50,025 --> 01:37:51,525
things felt strange.

2880
01:37:53,425 --> 01:37:54,524
So...

2881
01:37:54,525 --> 01:37:55,624
(Final one to pay, Kim Poong)

2882
01:37:55,625 --> 01:37:58,224
I am the one to finish up this season.

2883
01:37:58,225 --> 01:38:00,094
It was the last episode of this season.

2884
01:38:00,095 --> 01:38:02,765
I will pleasantly mark the end of this season.

2885
01:38:03,235 --> 01:38:06,905
Thank you!

2886
01:38:07,775 --> 01:38:09,504
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2887
01:38:09,505 --> 01:38:11,045
(Receipt: Total of 666 dollars)

2888
01:38:11,375 --> 01:38:12,804
(The day of the emergency planning committee...)

2889
01:38:12,805 --> 01:38:14,245
(for Handsome Guys)

2890
01:38:14,975 --> 01:38:17,345
(It feels tense in the chief director's office.)

2891
01:38:17,885 --> 01:38:20,614
(The Handsome Guys are shivering in fear.)

2892
01:38:20,615 --> 01:38:22,514
"What will happen to the future of Handsome Guys?"

2893
01:38:22,515 --> 01:38:24,085
We will talk about these things.

2894
01:38:24,125 --> 01:38:25,784
(They weren't a regular show even after 38 episodes.)

2895
01:38:25,785 --> 01:38:27,555
(On the edge of survival)

2896
01:38:27,725 --> 01:38:31,195
(Bringing up the viewer ratings seems to be very tough)

2897
01:38:31,325 --> 01:38:34,665
(A big move has to be made to attract the viewers)

2898
01:38:34,935 --> 01:38:37,035
(This could be the last chance given to Handsome Guys.)

2899
01:38:37,205 --> 01:38:39,875
(Will we return next week?)

2900
01:38:40,335 --> 01:38:41,504
(Handsome Guys)

2901
01:38:41,505 --> 01:38:43,345
(Version 3.0, Until the End)

2902
01:38:43,975 --> 01:38:47,545
(Pleasant retreat session on a bright summer day?)

2903
01:38:48,115 --> 01:38:51,614
(Things feel great at the start.)

2904
01:38:51,615 --> 01:38:52,644
(What?)

2905
01:38:52,645 --> 01:38:53,785
(But...)

2906
01:38:55,585 --> 01:38:58,485
(something feels off.)

2907
01:38:59,025 --> 01:39:00,924
(The retreat session...)

2908
01:39:00,925 --> 01:39:02,825
(quickly goes under a state of emergency.)

2909
01:39:03,095 --> 01:39:05,565
(The new concept that shocked the Handsome Guys)

2910
01:39:06,095 --> 01:39:07,265
Weren't we just traveling?

2911
01:39:07,565 --> 01:39:09,735
(Handsome Guys' insufficient life)

2912
01:39:09,835 --> 01:39:11,334
(Will we be lacking something?)

2913
01:39:11,335 --> 01:39:13,235
(Or will we become a tribe?)

2914
01:39:13,335 --> 01:39:14,805
(From now on, )

2915
01:39:15,375 --> 01:39:17,405
(you will live with one thing missing.)

2916
01:39:17,905 --> 01:39:19,045
What?

2917
01:39:19,575 --> 01:39:21,214
(They took the bait.)

2918
01:39:21,215 --> 01:39:23,784
(That just means things are going to be tough.)

2919
01:39:23,785 --> 01:39:25,814
(Handsome Tribe's insufficient life)

2920
01:39:25,815 --> 01:39:27,714
(The pride of a celebrity, style)

2921
01:39:27,715 --> 01:39:29,485
(Confiscated)

2922
01:39:30,755 --> 01:39:31,955
(It will be better to take off our clothes.)

2923
01:39:32,085 --> 01:39:34,525
(That is what you can do.)

2924
01:39:34,655 --> 01:39:37,265
(New style shown by the Handsome Guys)

2925
01:39:37,295 --> 01:39:39,094
(The love of the Handsome Guys, taste)

2926
01:39:39,095 --> 01:39:41,065
(Confiscated)

2927
01:39:41,565 --> 01:39:42,635
(My food!)

2928
01:39:43,035 --> 01:39:44,605
(They go through a hunger they have never experienced before.)

2929
01:39:44,935 --> 01:39:47,135
(Is this a disaster show or what?)

2930
01:39:47,475 --> 01:39:49,644
(The comfort that felt obvious)

2931
01:39:49,645 --> 01:39:50,805
(Confiscated)

2932
01:39:51,105 --> 01:39:54,115
(An unexpected discomfort takes over the Handsome Guys.)

2933
01:39:54,975 --> 01:39:56,885
(The staff members must go through it too.)

2934
01:39:57,015 --> 01:39:58,715
(What are we to do?)

2935
01:39:58,885 --> 01:40:02,084
(The game for the escape from insufficiency will begin.)

2936
01:40:02,085 --> 01:40:03,554
(That makes things different.)

2937
01:40:03,555 --> 01:40:05,154
(Let's escape.)

2938
01:40:05,155 --> 01:40:07,754
(United we stand, divided we fall.)

2939
01:40:07,755 --> 01:40:10,395
(Are you sure?)

2940
01:40:10,695 --> 01:40:13,765
(We must escape no matter what.)

2941
01:40:13,935 --> 01:40:16,095
(What is this?)

2942
01:40:16,635 --> 01:40:17,904
One, two, three.

2943
01:40:17,905 --> 01:40:18,905
(Sighing)

2944
01:40:18,906 --> 01:40:20,874
(It's party time!)

2945
01:40:20,875 --> 01:40:22,874
(Your insufficiency...)

2946
01:40:22,875 --> 01:40:25,175
(becomes my joy.)

2947
01:40:25,305 --> 01:40:28,574
(My insufficiency...)

2948
01:40:28,575 --> 01:40:30,615
(is just painful.)

2949
01:40:30,815 --> 01:40:34,114
(There's no such thing as age for escape.)

2950
01:40:34,115 --> 01:40:36,855
(Do everything you can...)

2951
01:40:37,185 --> 01:40:40,425
(to escape from insufficiency.)

2952
01:40:40,555 --> 01:40:43,964
(When there is an insufficiency, )

2953
01:40:43,965 --> 01:40:47,565
(there will be more laughter.)

2954
01:40:47,765 --> 01:40:51,665
(A fancy transformation of the Handsome Guys)

2955
01:40:51,835 --> 01:40:53,604
(A desperate fight...)

2956
01:40:53,605 --> 01:40:55,774
(between the Handsome Guys)

2957
01:40:55,775 --> 01:40:57,004
(If you are curious?)

2958
01:40:57,005 --> 01:40:59,375
(Thursday nights, 8:40pm)

2959
01:40:59,545 --> 01:41:06,015
(Please show us a lot of support.)
