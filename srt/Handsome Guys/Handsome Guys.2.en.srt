1
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,717
(Six men gathered early in the morning.)

2
00:00:31,718 --> 00:00:32,848
(Do you know the title of our show?)

3
00:00:32,849 --> 00:00:34,189
(What is it?)

4
00:00:34,689 --> 00:00:39,558
(We're Handsome Guys.)

5
00:00:40,028 --> 00:00:41,958
We visit meaningful places all over the country.

6
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:43,569
(National heritages in South Gyeongsang Province)

7
00:00:44,028 --> 00:00:45,097
(Do you know how to play bingo?)

8
00:00:45,098 --> 00:00:47,268
(If you guess the right answer, )

9
00:00:47,269 --> 00:00:49,568
(you'll occupy one square on the scorecard.)

10
00:00:49,569 --> 00:00:52,008
(The first team to complete one line will win.)

11
00:00:52,368 --> 00:00:54,007
(You'll be split into a team of three.)

12
00:00:54,008 --> 00:00:55,477
(Team Handsome: Lee Yi Kyung, Jin, Oh Sang Uk)

13
00:00:55,478 --> 00:00:57,977
(Team Guys: Cha Tae Hyun, Shin Seung Ho, Kim Dong Hyun)

14
00:00:57,978 --> 00:00:59,007
(The winning team...)

15
00:00:59,008 --> 00:01:00,319
(will get off work.)

16
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:02,879
(The losing team will catch monkfish.)

17
00:01:03,319 --> 00:01:04,349
Monkfish?

18
00:01:05,389 --> 00:01:06,517
(Avoid the monkfish.)

19
00:01:06,518 --> 00:01:07,919
(Both teams decide the first location beforehand.)

20
00:01:08,758 --> 00:01:11,028
(Team Handsome heads to Tongdosa Temple in Yangsan.)

21
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,499
(Team Guys heads to the Eastern Palaces in Busan.)

22
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:15,698
(If we meet you in Busan, )

23
00:01:16,029 --> 00:01:17,397
(That means war.)

24
00:01:17,398 --> 00:01:18,498
(Team Handsome's car)

25
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:20,698
(The war starts.)

26
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:24,208
(After wasting time, Team Guys heads to Yangsan.)

27
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:25,239
(The Eastern Palaces in Busan)

28
00:01:26,109 --> 00:01:29,008
(Team Handsome occupies Busan easily.)

29
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:32,508
(Team Guys is running out of time due to Team Handsome's betrayal.)

30
00:01:32,648 --> 00:01:34,378
(They must guess right to get a chance of winning.)

31
00:01:34,379 --> 00:01:35,719
(Tongdosa Temple in Yangsan)

32
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:39,858
(Fortunately, Team Guys obtained Yangsan.)

33
00:01:40,019 --> 00:01:41,519
(They might make us take a nap.)

34
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,659
(Team Handsome's another war of nerves starts.)

35
00:01:45,058 --> 00:01:46,527
(To make matters worse, )

36
00:01:46,528 --> 00:01:49,658
(they must also find someone whose birthday is this week.)

37
00:01:49,659 --> 00:01:53,299
(Team Handsome's spirit is getting high.)

38
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:55,039
(Upo Wetland in Changnyeong)

39
00:01:55,269 --> 00:01:58,368
(They even occupied Upo Wetland.)

40
00:01:58,608 --> 00:02:00,978
We got Changnyeong and Busan down.

41
00:02:01,278 --> 00:02:02,837
We'll secure our bingo with just Namhae.

42
00:02:02,838 --> 00:02:04,348
- Seriously.
- This feels really great!

43
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:06,107
- That was really great.
- Amazing.

44
00:02:06,108 --> 00:02:09,018
(Will Team Handsome finish the race?)

45
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:10,288
- It was correct.
- It was correct.

46
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:11,948
I was so surprised that I threw it away.

47
00:02:12,648 --> 00:02:14,519
I threw it over there. I must go and get it.

48
00:02:15,189 --> 00:02:16,887
- Aren't you tired?
- I'm okay for now.

49
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:18,929
Isn't it better that I drive a little?

50
00:02:19,629 --> 00:02:20,758
- It's okay.
- It's okay?

51
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:22,459
This is crazy.

52
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:25,328
We got two questions, so I feel great.

53
00:02:25,329 --> 00:02:26,969
Seok Jin did all the work.

54
00:02:27,998 --> 00:02:29,239
That was unbelievable.

55
00:02:29,838 --> 00:02:31,839
Who did it isn't important.

56
00:02:32,339 --> 00:02:33,737
- Now...
- The address.

57
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:35,539
I'll tell you the address.

58
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:37,948
Changnyeong-gun, Changnyeong-eup.

59
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:42,349
(Changnyeong?)

60
00:02:42,918 --> 00:02:44,348
All right.

61
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:47,257
Thanks to Seok Jin,

62
00:02:47,258 --> 00:02:48,288
(They didn't imagine Team Guys being in Jinju.)

63
00:02:48,289 --> 00:02:50,289
- we now have...
- We got it done.

64
00:02:50,529 --> 00:02:51,658
- Check this out.
- "Frog."

65
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:54,228
We got Changnyeong and Busan down.

66
00:02:54,499 --> 00:02:56,099
We'll secure our bingo with just Namhae.

67
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:58,398
This is the only option for them.

68
00:02:58,399 --> 00:03:00,099
- Right.
- It's the worst.

69
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,439
You're right.

70
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,368
This time, we'll make them sleep no matter what.

71
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:05,338
Then we'll head to Jinju right away.

72
00:03:05,339 --> 00:03:07,638
(They plan to complete the bingo in the meantime.)

73
00:03:08,178 --> 00:03:09,878
Okay, we'll go to Changnyeong.

74
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,409
- Let's go to Changnyeong.
- Here we go.

75
00:03:11,578 --> 00:03:12,779
We're going to Changnyeong.

76
00:03:13,279 --> 00:03:14,748
Changnyeong-gun, Changnyeong-eup.

77
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:17,118
(They have no idea where Team Guys is.)

78
00:03:17,119 --> 00:03:19,018
Hwawangsangwallyongsa-gil.

79
00:03:19,349 --> 00:03:20,658
(Team Handsome sets off to Gwallyongsa Temple.)

80
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:22,319
Can we go this way?

81
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,427
(The game of bingo falls into a labyrinth.)

82
00:03:27,428 --> 00:03:29,599
(Will Team Handsome's plan succeed?)

83
00:03:30,069 --> 00:03:32,128
Going this way saved us ten minutes.

84
00:03:32,129 --> 00:03:33,167
We'll get there in 30 minutes.

85
00:03:33,168 --> 00:03:35,798
Let's take our time. Once our car goes in,

86
00:03:36,399 --> 00:03:38,607
- let's not rush.
- This is good.

87
00:03:38,608 --> 00:03:40,439
(This is good.)

88
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:46,719
(For some reason, Sang Uk becomes sentimental.)

89
00:03:47,149 --> 00:03:51,348
(Moist)

90
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:52,618
(Laughing)

91
00:03:52,619 --> 00:03:54,257
No matter how much I think about it, the "frog" is amazing.

92
00:03:54,258 --> 00:03:55,387
- That was insane.
- I feel happy.

93
00:03:55,388 --> 00:03:57,257
- It was crazy.
- What's amazing is...

94
00:03:57,258 --> 00:03:58,659
that I thought it would be wrong.

95
00:03:59,529 --> 00:04:00,899
When he said that it was correct...

96
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:02,999
When he said, "Frog is correct..."

97
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:04,499
(Thrilling)

98
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,569
It made me happy.

99
00:04:06,768 --> 00:04:10,339
(With Upo Wetland behind them while being in a good mood)

100
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,237
(Smiling)

101
00:04:12,238 --> 00:04:13,977
Fate is a funny thing.

102
00:04:13,978 --> 00:04:15,507
What if I lost the game of rock-paper-scissors?

103
00:04:15,508 --> 00:04:17,977
- I know.
- As we understand the situation...

104
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:19,177
(The Tale of Upo Wetland Hero)

105
00:04:19,178 --> 00:04:20,518
(Part 2: What If I lost the game of rock-paper-scissors?)

106
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:22,219
Right.

107
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:23,948
Frog Seok Jin, you nailed it.

108
00:04:24,249 --> 00:04:25,689
I can't believe that I won rock-paper-scissors.

109
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:28,119
I thought the answer was "turtle."

110
00:04:28,418 --> 00:04:30,028
Even while shouting "frog,"

111
00:04:30,029 --> 00:04:32,058
I thought, "It must be turtle. What should I do?"

112
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:33,697
"I shouldn't have won rock-paper-scissors."

113
00:04:33,698 --> 00:04:34,698
Seriously?

114
00:04:35,129 --> 00:04:36,868
That's what I thought.

115
00:04:36,869 --> 00:04:38,598
The answer was quite shocking,

116
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:40,437
but I knew that it was a type of animal.

117
00:04:40,438 --> 00:04:42,667
Frogs can jump up to a certain height.

118
00:04:42,668 --> 00:04:45,668
Something of this size jumped that high.

119
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:46,808
(In awe)

120
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,509
I'm starving.

121
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,748
- Me too. I'm hungry.
- It's insane.

122
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:53,247
There's a round trip of hiking for 40 minutes.

123
00:04:53,248 --> 00:04:54,678
If we finish it quickly...

124
00:04:54,949 --> 00:04:57,719
If we run, we'll be able to finish it in 10 to 15 minutes.

125
00:04:58,149 --> 00:04:59,487
Is it a round trip of hiking for 40 minutes?

126
00:04:59,488 --> 00:05:00,557
- A round trip for 40 minutes.
- Yes.

127
00:05:00,558 --> 00:05:02,358
Twenty minutes of climbing up is nothing.

128
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:05,529
If it takes 20 minutes to go up and 20 minutes to come down,

129
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,857
we can run...

130
00:05:07,858 --> 00:05:10,268
and finish in 10 to 15 minutes.

131
00:05:10,269 --> 00:05:12,898
I'm so hungry that my stomach hurts.

132
00:05:12,899 --> 00:05:15,898
After finishing that, we'll go and eat.

133
00:05:15,899 --> 00:05:16,909
That sounds good.

134
00:05:17,209 --> 00:05:18,438
You know what I mean?

135
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,578
You're insane.

136
00:05:20,579 --> 00:05:21,978
Frog Seok Jin, you're insane.

137
00:05:23,009 --> 00:05:25,778
(Team Guys)

138
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:28,219
Gosh, this is... That's right.

139
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:30,248
Upo Wetland in Changnyeong.

140
00:05:30,548 --> 00:05:32,618
Did they get Upo Wetland in Changnyeong?

141
00:05:32,748 --> 00:05:34,789
After Upo Wetland, where would they be heading?

142
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:36,417
It's definitely Namhae.

143
00:05:36,418 --> 00:05:37,688
- Namhae?
- Of course.

144
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:40,398
Then we'll be meeting them in Namhae.

145
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,898
(Their guess is also wrong.)

146
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:43,199
Goodness.

147
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:45,969
If we think about it, we're in trouble.

148
00:05:47,068 --> 00:05:48,498
If they go to Namhae from here...

149
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:50,538
How long does it take from Changnyeong to Namhae?

150
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:51,908
It takes 2 hours and 5 minutes.

151
00:05:51,909 --> 00:05:53,539
- Two hours and five minutes?
- Yes.

152
00:05:54,178 --> 00:05:58,048
From Jinju to Namhae, it takes 1 hour and 15 minutes.

153
00:05:58,279 --> 00:05:59,648
We'll take time for the quiz in Jinju,

154
00:05:59,649 --> 00:06:01,018
and we have a nap of 30 minutes.

155
00:06:01,019 --> 00:06:02,448
We included that in our calculation.

156
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:03,817
(Team Handsome and Guys' expected time of arrival)

157
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:06,117
(And an assignment that hasn't been solved yet)

158
00:06:06,118 --> 00:06:07,357
(Wishing Happy Birthday Card)

159
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:08,918
Won't it be dangerous for us?

160
00:06:09,019 --> 00:06:11,159
- We must get this no matter what.
- We must hurry.

161
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:12,487
We don't have much time.

162
00:06:12,488 --> 00:06:14,498
- Are we here?
- It's up ahead.

163
00:06:14,699 --> 00:06:16,728
Quickly. We have no time.

164
00:06:17,428 --> 00:06:18,667
(They rush to meet...)

165
00:06:18,668 --> 00:06:20,098
(a handsome heritage in Jinju.)

166
00:06:20,099 --> 00:06:21,969
- We don't have much time.
- No.

167
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:25,367
There he is.

168
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:26,368
Gosh.

169
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,708
Come over here.

170
00:06:29,709 --> 00:06:31,747
It's the birthday boy.

171
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:33,519
- Oh, yes.
- Really?

172
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:36,219
- I'm glad to see you.
- Seriously.

173
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:41,688
(Dong Hyun picked Wishing Happy Birthday card.)

174
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:43,987
- That's unbelievable.
- That's the worst.

175
00:06:43,988 --> 00:06:45,228
Someone whose birthday is this week.

176
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,128
How will I find someone whose birthday is this week?

177
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:49,529
We'll have to ask the passersby.

178
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,599
(I see...)

179
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:53,798
- Is it anyone's birthday?
- Your birthday is this week.

180
00:06:54,899 --> 00:06:56,398
No one's birthday is this week?

181
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:58,539
(Is anyone there?)

182
00:06:58,738 --> 00:07:01,108
Okay, we found him.

183
00:07:01,878 --> 00:07:03,307
- Okay, we got him.
- Where is he?

184
00:07:03,308 --> 00:07:04,308
(They found a birthday boy.)

185
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:06,948
- He's over there.
- The one with glasses.

186
00:07:06,949 --> 00:07:09,018
(They identify his appearance.)

187
00:07:09,019 --> 00:07:10,218
Where have you been?

188
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:11,948
(They capture the birthday boy with Tae Hyun's acute sight.)

189
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:13,589
Can we look at your ID card?

190
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:15,857
- Unbelievable.
- Unbelievable.

191
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:18,089
Today is October 28.

192
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:19,728
He was born on November 1, 1999.

193
00:07:20,498 --> 00:07:21,758
(A moment more joyful than his own birthday)

194
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,798
Tae Hyun...

195
00:07:23,529 --> 00:07:25,469
Here you go. The candle went out.

196
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,468
It can't be helped because of the wind.

197
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:29,368
One, two, three, four.

198
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:32,209
(It's a little simple, )

199
00:07:32,409 --> 00:07:35,039
(but we sincerely wish him Happy Birthday.)

200
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:36,408
(Dear...)

201
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:37,548
(Soo Bin)

202
00:07:38,548 --> 00:07:40,779
(Happy Birthday to you)

203
00:07:40,818 --> 00:07:41,918
Pretend that it's lit.

204
00:07:43,248 --> 00:07:45,088
- Happy Birthday.
- Happy Birthday.

205
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,089
(Wishing Happy Birthday card mission is complete.)

206
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:48,159
- Okay.
- How did you find him?

207
00:07:48,688 --> 00:07:49,719
I brought it up randomly.

208
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:52,427
- Okay.
- Jinju seems like...

209
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:53,758
In many ways,

210
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,228
it seems like a place of victory.

211
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:57,867
- We might make it.
- That's hilarious.

212
00:07:57,868 --> 00:08:00,199
(They rush into Jinju Fortress.)

213
00:08:01,168 --> 00:08:04,769
(Jinju National Museum)

214
00:08:05,339 --> 00:08:06,508
(Handsome heritage 2: Joseon's firepower weapon)

215
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:07,738
It's a race against time now.

216
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:09,039
We must be diligent now.

217
00:08:09,438 --> 00:08:10,948
In two hours, we're planning...

218
00:08:10,949 --> 00:08:13,278
to arrive in Namhae.

219
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:14,449
Let me see how long it takes from here.

220
00:08:16,019 --> 00:08:17,289
One hour and 17 minutes.

221
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:19,089
It takes a long time.

222
00:08:19,488 --> 00:08:21,557
We'll fall behind since we have to sleep.

223
00:08:21,558 --> 00:08:22,617
(Considering their sleep time, they don't have much time.)

224
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:23,759
Goodness.

225
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:26,488
What if we have to work?

226
00:08:27,659 --> 00:08:30,098
How about we pass...

227
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:31,699
this one and go straight to Namhae?

228
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:33,368
(Chuckling)

229
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:35,498
Right, we'd have a better chance of winning that way.

230
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:37,367
- That's the only way.
- We'd have a better chance.

231
00:08:37,368 --> 00:08:38,368
Yes.

232
00:08:38,369 --> 00:08:40,639
Then we can block them.

233
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:42,508
But Tae Hyun, I...

234
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:44,149
We might not make it with 30 minutes of nap.

235
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:45,779
Here's what I think.

236
00:08:46,808 --> 00:08:47,817
You must say it quickly.

237
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,248
Yongseondae is nearby...

238
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:52,848
(He needs to organize his thoughts.)

239
00:08:52,849 --> 00:08:54,558
- It's nearby.
- Yes.

240
00:08:54,858 --> 00:08:56,558
It'd be great if we could get Yongseondae.

241
00:08:56,818 --> 00:08:57,858
We're not going to Yongseondae.

242
00:08:57,859 --> 00:08:59,028
Here's what I'm worried about.

243
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:01,598
If they go to Yongseondae,

244
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:04,097
- we have to go to Namhae...
- We'll meet in Jinju.

245
00:09:04,098 --> 00:09:05,168
We have to come back to Jinju.

246
00:09:05,698 --> 00:09:08,067
What do we do? It's better that we skip here.

247
00:09:08,068 --> 00:09:10,308
- What do we do?
- Due to time, we have to go.

248
00:09:10,909 --> 00:09:12,009
However,

249
00:09:12,139 --> 00:09:14,177
it won't work because you haven't eaten anything.

250
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,308
No, Tae Hyun.

251
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:17,108
We don't have time to eat.

252
00:09:17,109 --> 00:09:18,609
We don't have time to eat.

253
00:09:18,948 --> 00:09:20,947
I'm sorry, but you won't get to eat anything.

254
00:09:20,948 --> 00:09:21,948
(The fear of monkfish calms down their appetite.)

255
00:09:21,949 --> 00:09:24,518
We have no choice. We came this far.

256
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,847
We should've left a long time ago.

257
00:09:25,848 --> 00:09:27,019
- Right.
- If we were to leave.

258
00:09:27,489 --> 00:09:28,558
We're in trouble.

259
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:30,088
We have no choice.

260
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:32,128
Suddenly, we have more chance of losing.

261
00:09:32,129 --> 00:09:34,898
- Suddenly...
- I didn't think that they would...

262
00:09:34,899 --> 00:09:36,259
think of Namhae, but they did.

263
00:09:36,529 --> 00:09:38,399
- That was our only chance.
- Goodness.

264
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:40,028
I'm sure that it's chaotic,

265
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:42,067
but here's someone who'll explain.

266
00:09:42,068 --> 00:09:43,337
- Hello.
- Hello.

267
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:44,338
(Here's a curator who will explain this place.)

268
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:45,437
Hello.

269
00:09:45,438 --> 00:09:48,238
I'm Heo Moon Haeng, a curator at Jinju National Museum.

270
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,908
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

271
00:09:49,909 --> 00:09:51,677
Do you know the three major battles during the Imjin War?

272
00:09:51,678 --> 00:09:54,177
- Yes, I do.
- Which ones?

273
00:09:54,178 --> 00:09:55,618
- Battle of Hansan Island.
- Battle of Hansan Island.

274
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:57,518
- Battle of Haengju?
- Yes.

275
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,289
- And Siege of Jinju.
- That's correct.

276
00:09:59,489 --> 00:10:01,418
I knew it. Goodness.

277
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:02,917
It's not clear in my head,

278
00:10:02,918 --> 00:10:04,658
but I remember some of them.

279
00:10:04,659 --> 00:10:06,229
- Recently...
- He's the best in Korean history.

280
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:09,498
Jinju Fortress is located on the Nam River.

281
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:12,128
It's a gift of nature thanks to...

282
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:13,229
its surrounding topography.

283
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:16,337
It's also where Siege of Jinju took place,

284
00:10:16,338 --> 00:10:18,807
one of the three major battles during the Imjin War.

285
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:20,068
Right, Siege of Jinju.

286
00:10:21,239 --> 00:10:22,239
(Siege of Jinju)

287
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,808
Siege of Jinju took place in October 1592.

288
00:10:26,048 --> 00:10:28,217
Led by General Kim Si Min,

289
00:10:28,218 --> 00:10:30,618
3,800 Joseon soldiers repelled...

290
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:32,817
tens of thousands of Japanese soldiers.

291
00:10:32,818 --> 00:10:34,158
It was a huge victory.

292
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:36,687
(In October 1592, led by General Kim Si Min, public and private...)

293
00:10:36,688 --> 00:10:38,888
(armies came together to overcome a military strength...)

294
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,259
(that was 8 times greater.)

295
00:10:42,359 --> 00:10:45,168
(1 of Korea's 3 major pavilions located at Jinju Fortress)

296
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:49,999
(Chokseongnu Pavilion)

297
00:10:50,568 --> 00:10:54,837
(There's also Uiam Rock with the spirit of loyalty and resistance...)

298
00:10:54,838 --> 00:10:59,909
(from Nongae who jumped into the river with a Japanese general.)

299
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,518
After the Imjin War,

300
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,019
Jinju Fortress is recognized as a strategic point.

301
00:11:06,948 --> 00:11:09,758
Today, it's a place where...

302
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,259
history of Jinju resides.

303
00:11:12,029 --> 00:11:13,958
(I see.)

304
00:11:14,499 --> 00:11:16,898
In the front, you'll see Jinju National Museum.

305
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:18,499
(Jinju National Museum located inside Jinju Fortress)

306
00:11:19,298 --> 00:11:23,097
There's an exhibition about the Imjin War.

307
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:25,068
(Relics related to the Imjin War are exhibited.)

308
00:11:26,838 --> 00:11:28,707
Please come into the exhibition room.

309
00:11:28,708 --> 00:11:29,739
(They move into the exhibition room.)

310
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:36,778
In the front, you'll see Bomb Shell,

311
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,417
one of the main weapons used during the Imjin War.

312
00:11:39,418 --> 00:11:41,289
(Bomb Shell)

313
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:42,687
- It's a cannonball.
- It is.

314
00:11:42,688 --> 00:11:44,057
(Cannonball?)

315
00:11:44,058 --> 00:11:46,528
It's a time bomb that was used...

316
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:47,828
during the Imjin War.

317
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:51,768
Inside a round iron ring,

318
00:11:51,769 --> 00:11:55,369
pieces of iron and something called mokgok are placed.

319
00:11:55,838 --> 00:11:57,108
Mokgok is...

320
00:11:57,109 --> 00:11:59,837
a device that stalls time.

321
00:11:59,838 --> 00:12:00,908
(A device that delays time of the explosion)

322
00:12:00,909 --> 00:12:03,278
A string is tied along the furrow.

323
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,947
If you want to explode it quickly, you wrap it five times.

324
00:12:05,948 --> 00:12:08,778
If you want to explode it slowly, you wrap it ten times.

325
00:12:08,779 --> 00:12:09,917
Ten times?

326
00:12:09,918 --> 00:12:11,619
Next, gunpowder is added.

327
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,558
Then it becomes a bomb.

328
00:12:15,489 --> 00:12:18,628
Once it's sealed, the wick is pulled to explode it.

329
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:20,187
It's a huge bomb.

330
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:21,258
(Once sealed, the wick is pulled to explode.)

331
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:23,158
This type of Bomb Shells...

332
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:26,297
could also be discharged with a cannon.

333
00:12:26,298 --> 00:12:27,468
(Usually, they were discharged with a cannon to attack.)

334
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:30,609
- This is what kills them.
- Right.

335
00:12:30,938 --> 00:12:33,609
- Pieces of iron.
- If you look here,

336
00:12:33,838 --> 00:12:36,978
Japanese soldiers were quite flustered...

337
00:12:36,979 --> 00:12:38,178
when they saw these Bomb Shells.

338
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,748
Frightened by the force,

339
00:12:40,749 --> 00:12:43,248
they abandoned the fortress and ran away...

340
00:12:43,249 --> 00:12:44,447
according to the records.

341
00:12:44,448 --> 00:12:47,417
("Those who were hit by it were killed. If not, they collapsed.)

342
00:12:47,418 --> 00:12:50,259
This weapon was very useful.

343
00:12:50,889 --> 00:12:53,758
- Is it like today's dynamite?
- Right.

344
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,457
It's similar to a grenade.

345
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,198
- Grenade?
- Yes.

346
00:12:57,629 --> 00:12:58,899
I think I've seen this.

347
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:00,328
(Fascinated)

348
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:01,399
Stonemason.

349
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,798
This is amazing.

350
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:06,109
In front of you, you'll see...

351
00:13:06,239 --> 00:13:08,638
- various cannons.
- Incredible.

352
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,238
(Used during the Imjin War)

353
00:13:10,239 --> 00:13:13,509
(Joseon military's artillery)

354
00:13:14,749 --> 00:13:18,688
(Showing the wisdom of our ancestors at that time)

355
00:13:19,149 --> 00:13:20,758
The artillery in the front...

356
00:13:20,759 --> 00:13:23,358
were made right before...

357
00:13:23,359 --> 00:13:24,529
the Imjin War.

358
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:27,087
In many historical dramas,

359
00:13:27,088 --> 00:13:29,258
the Joseon army is often armed...

360
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:31,797
- with bows and tridents.
- Right.

361
00:13:31,798 --> 00:13:34,238
In reality, it was an army that used...

362
00:13:34,239 --> 00:13:35,899
gunpowder weapons professionally.

363
00:13:36,438 --> 00:13:37,609
- Really?
- Yes.

364
00:13:37,668 --> 00:13:41,408
The biggest cannon is called Cheonja Chongtong Gun.

365
00:13:41,409 --> 00:13:42,638
- Cheonja Chongtong Gun?
- Yes.

366
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,178
Next to it is called Jija Chongtong Gun.

367
00:13:44,509 --> 00:13:47,149
Next to it is called Hyeonja Chongtong Gun.

368
00:13:47,918 --> 00:13:50,218
Cheonja, Jija, and Hyeonja.

369
00:13:51,019 --> 00:13:53,118
The Thousand Character Classic starts with...

370
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,519
- Cheon, meaning the sky.
- Cheon, meaning the sky.

371
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:56,418
- Ji, meaning the land.
- Ji, meaning the land.

372
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:57,888
- Hyeon, meaning black.
- Hyeon, meaning black.

373
00:13:57,889 --> 00:13:59,528
- Hwang, meaning yellow.
- You're right.

374
00:13:59,529 --> 00:14:01,457
According to the order of the Thousand Character Classic...

375
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:04,327
as well as the cannon's shooting range and power,

376
00:14:04,328 --> 00:14:06,427
they were named.

377
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,538
I see.

378
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:09,138
(Oh, I see.)

379
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,909
Cheonja Chongtong Gun's shooting range is about 1,000 steps.

380
00:14:12,338 --> 00:14:14,008
It's about 1km now.

381
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:15,338
It was that kind of weapon.

382
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:18,307
In the front, you'll see an arrow...

383
00:14:18,308 --> 00:14:19,879
made with wood.

384
00:14:20,249 --> 00:14:22,917
It's called Janggunjeon or Daejanggunjeon.

385
00:14:22,918 --> 00:14:24,149
(An arrow made for Cheonja Chongtong Gun)

386
00:14:24,348 --> 00:14:25,548
That's incredible.

387
00:14:26,889 --> 00:14:28,518
- I think it can fly.
- Yes, it can.

388
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:30,858
- Do you mean this?
- Yes.

389
00:14:30,859 --> 00:14:35,398
Daejanggunjeon was placed inside Cheonja Chongtong Gun and launched.

390
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,868
It was used to destroy the enemy's ship...

391
00:14:37,869 --> 00:14:39,998
or their structure.

392
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:41,399
- To destroy them?
- Yes.

393
00:14:41,769 --> 00:14:42,797
(Source: Jinju National Museum's Online Contents)

394
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:47,067
("Nothing could match Janggunjeon on fire that was discharged.")

395
00:14:47,068 --> 00:14:49,807
("When it comes to protecting the fortress,")

396
00:14:49,808 --> 00:14:52,248
("nothing is more precious than this machine.")

397
00:14:52,249 --> 00:14:54,519
(From "Ilseongnok" by King Jeongjo on January 22, 1786)

398
00:14:56,048 --> 00:15:00,289
(Daejanggunjeon was at the forefront of Joseon's firepower.)

399
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:04,288
Not only such arrows,

400
00:15:04,289 --> 00:15:06,528
but stone cannonballs like these...

401
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:08,998
were placed inside to shoot.

402
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:11,827
Their gunpowder must have been strong enough...

403
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:14,268
to send such heavy rocks.

404
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:17,408
Yes, you can tell that the level...

405
00:15:17,409 --> 00:15:19,508
of Joseon's gunpowder weapons was quite high.

406
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:20,778
That's incredible.

407
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:21,938
(It shows the wisdom of our ancestors.)

408
00:15:22,808 --> 00:15:24,979
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

409
00:15:25,078 --> 00:15:26,848
Will the question be related to his explanation?

410
00:15:27,048 --> 00:15:29,278
I'm trying to remember what he said.

411
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,577
It's impossible to remember it.

412
00:15:30,578 --> 00:15:32,148
I know. It's too much.

413
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:34,758
We'll continue at a different location.

414
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:35,789
Okay.

415
00:15:36,058 --> 00:15:38,988
We won't have enough time to eat.

416
00:15:38,989 --> 00:15:41,198
I knew it. We should've eaten before.

417
00:15:41,328 --> 00:15:42,828
Shall we surrender and eat?

418
00:15:44,499 --> 00:15:46,869
The question might be difficult.

419
00:15:47,438 --> 00:15:48,438
Here?

420
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:50,498
(Surprised)

421
00:15:50,499 --> 00:15:51,539
What's that?

422
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,479
- Why are we at a strange place?
- What's this?

423
00:15:55,578 --> 00:15:57,308
- Where should we sit?
- What?

424
00:15:59,379 --> 00:16:02,619
The other team used the 30-minute nap card.

425
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:06,519
The three of you must sleep right now.

426
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:10,488
(Goodness)

427
00:16:10,489 --> 00:16:11,828
We can't do this.

428
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:15,399
(A place to sleep)

429
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,328
(An instant place for a nap)

430
00:16:18,629 --> 00:16:21,039
(On an insulated silver mat)

431
00:16:21,269 --> 00:16:23,968
(Latex pillows, microfiber blankets, and aromatic air freshener)

432
00:16:24,139 --> 00:16:26,308
(Sleep well.)

433
00:16:26,869 --> 00:16:28,808
(Team Handsome a moment ago)

434
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:31,109
Let's put them to sleep.

435
00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:33,448
We'll put them to sleep now.

436
00:16:34,178 --> 00:16:35,578
Really? Shouldn't we call them?

437
00:16:35,718 --> 00:16:37,417
Is that necessary?

438
00:16:37,418 --> 00:16:39,118
We should use it as soon as possible.

439
00:16:39,119 --> 00:16:40,619
Okay, put them to sleep.

440
00:16:41,318 --> 00:16:42,619
They probably ate,

441
00:16:43,058 --> 00:16:44,159
so this is good timing.

442
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:46,859
(Jin's timing is...)

443
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,427
I can't fall asleep because I'm too hungry.

444
00:16:49,428 --> 00:16:51,568
(His timing is perfect.)

445
00:16:52,129 --> 00:16:54,798
(Doomed)

446
00:16:55,269 --> 00:16:56,998
- We can't do this.
- What?

447
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:58,538
Goodness.

448
00:16:58,539 --> 00:16:59,609
- What is it?
- What is it?

449
00:17:00,909 --> 00:17:03,778
It will be harder to fall asleep. What's this?

450
00:17:03,779 --> 00:17:05,447
We're in a hurry.

451
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:08,118
My goodness.

452
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:10,047
This is insane.

453
00:17:10,048 --> 00:17:11,988
Tae Hyun, we're in a hurry.

454
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,458
(Insane of insane)

455
00:17:15,818 --> 00:17:17,057
Goodness.

456
00:17:17,058 --> 00:17:18,259
(Team Guys is dragged into taking a nap.)

457
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:20,529
We're in trouble.

458
00:17:21,598 --> 00:17:24,198
I didn't expect it to be so helpful.

459
00:17:25,229 --> 00:17:26,898
(Devastated)

460
00:17:26,899 --> 00:17:28,169
We're going to Namhae, right?

461
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:29,669
This is terrible.

462
00:17:31,808 --> 00:17:33,509
We'll forget everything that we heard.

463
00:17:34,068 --> 00:17:36,378
We should sleep after we answer the question.

464
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:38,848
How did they time it so well?

465
00:17:40,548 --> 00:17:41,719
Seung Ho.

466
00:17:42,219 --> 00:17:43,219
On our way here,

467
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,519
you said that Jinju was the city of victory.

468
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:47,218
Victory for the mentality.

469
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:48,387
(I meant, victory for the mentality.)

470
00:17:48,388 --> 00:17:49,789
All our predictions are wrong.

471
00:17:50,858 --> 00:17:52,288
- None of them are right.
- Then let's...

472
00:17:52,289 --> 00:17:53,988
stop making predictions.

473
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,929
(Making predictions is prohibited from now on.)

474
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:57,258
If I'd known, I would've eaten...

475
00:17:57,259 --> 00:17:58,568
- water parsley pork belly.
- Me too.

476
00:17:58,699 --> 00:17:59,868
That would have been better.

477
00:18:01,368 --> 00:18:02,438
Something delicious.

478
00:18:02,439 --> 00:18:03,538
(Also feeling sad about not eating)

479
00:18:03,539 --> 00:18:04,708
This is terrible.

480
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,239
This is so terrible.

481
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,279
There's no solution to this.

482
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:10,578
Namhae...

483
00:18:11,078 --> 00:18:12,509
I have a bad feeling about this.

484
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,918
What's going to happen?

485
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:16,179
(Team Guys is full of anxiety.)

486
00:18:18,048 --> 00:18:19,118
(Snoring)

487
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:24,929
(They're sleeping.)

488
00:18:25,158 --> 00:18:29,259
(Sleeping soundly)

489
00:18:29,898 --> 00:18:31,429
(In a deep sleep)

490
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:39,009
(Except Seung Ho)

491
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:43,637
(And...)

492
00:18:43,638 --> 00:18:48,118
(I surrender.)

493
00:18:50,249 --> 00:18:55,989
(Dream about monkfish.)

494
00:18:56,388 --> 00:18:59,189
(Team Handsome)

495
00:19:00,489 --> 00:19:02,759
We keep going up.

496
00:19:04,058 --> 00:19:05,529
That's good for us.

497
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:07,568
It means that we'll climb less.

498
00:19:08,838 --> 00:19:09,938
This is it.

499
00:19:09,939 --> 00:19:11,508
(They arrive at Gwallyongsa Temple, the next handsome heritage.)

500
00:19:11,509 --> 00:19:12,669
Are we there?

501
00:19:13,969 --> 00:19:16,308
(Inside a curtain of white clouds)

502
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,348
(Located under the Mount Gwallyong folding screen)

503
00:19:20,179 --> 00:19:23,179
(A small temple in the mountain)

504
00:19:23,949 --> 00:19:28,588
(Stone Seated Buddha of Gwallyongsa Temple)

505
00:19:29,118 --> 00:19:33,229
(A gem-like Buddhist temple hidden in the mountain)

506
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:38,169
(Gwallyongsa Temple in Changnyeong)

507
00:19:38,769 --> 00:19:42,199
(What treasure will they find here?)

508
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:45,638
(Along the mountain path behind Gwallyongsa Temple)

509
00:19:46,308 --> 00:19:49,509
(When you hike up an easy trail)

510
00:19:50,078 --> 00:19:53,308
(What you'll see after hard work)

511
00:19:53,848 --> 00:19:58,918
(Stone Seated Buddha of Gwallyongsa Temple)

512
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:01,358
(Stone Seated Buddha of Gwallyongsa Temple)

513
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:06,888
(Sentient beings, come and get your hint.)

514
00:20:07,229 --> 00:20:09,229
(However...)

515
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:12,929
(As soon as they arrive, the rain starts pouring.)

516
00:20:13,328 --> 00:20:15,638
We can't continue in this weather.

517
00:20:15,699 --> 00:20:16,898
It's raining a lot.

518
00:20:18,338 --> 00:20:19,567
You're here.

519
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:22,138
- It's called Gwallyongsa Temple.
- It's Gwallyongsa Temple.

520
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:24,378
Originally, there was...

521
00:20:24,648 --> 00:20:26,348
a hike.

522
00:20:26,378 --> 00:20:28,278
Due to the rain,

523
00:20:28,279 --> 00:20:30,317
climbing up could be dangerous.

524
00:20:30,318 --> 00:20:31,617
You won't be going up.

525
00:20:31,618 --> 00:20:33,949
A round trip of 40 minutes is canceled.

526
00:20:34,019 --> 00:20:36,189
I'm sorry, but...

527
00:20:36,618 --> 00:20:37,989
Did the hint disappear?

528
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:39,857
You can no longer get any hint.

529
00:20:39,858 --> 00:20:41,858
(Clean)

530
00:20:43,229 --> 00:20:48,939
(See you next time, sentient beings.)

531
00:20:49,868 --> 00:20:52,508
- It was sunny all day long.
- Right.

532
00:20:52,509 --> 00:20:54,878
- Suddenly, it changed.
- When we got to Gwallyongsa Temple.

533
00:20:55,378 --> 00:20:57,778
We would've gotten it right if we had the hint.

534
00:20:57,779 --> 00:21:00,178
Right, but we're fine because Jin is with us.

535
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:01,278
- No way.
- You're right.

536
00:21:01,279 --> 00:21:02,317
What's this?

537
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:03,647
Look at the fog...

538
00:21:03,648 --> 00:21:04,949
- up there.
- My goodness.

539
00:21:05,588 --> 00:21:07,019
We almost went up there.

540
00:21:07,588 --> 00:21:09,058
I don't think so.

541
00:21:09,189 --> 00:21:11,188
Even if we run, the round trip won't be 40 minutes.

542
00:21:11,189 --> 00:21:12,189
It'd take four hours.

543
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:13,928
The flowers look so pretty like this.

544
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:15,199
- Right.
- Hello.

545
00:21:15,828 --> 00:21:16,958
Hello, sir.

546
00:21:16,959 --> 00:21:18,229
- Hello.
- Hello.

547
00:21:18,269 --> 00:21:22,238
I'm a cultural tour guide at Gwallyongsa Temple in Changnyeong.

548
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,838
I'm Moonsu Shim Jae Man.

549
00:21:26,039 --> 00:21:27,978
"Moonsu" must be your pseudonym.

550
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:29,708
- It's my Buddhist name.
- Your Buddhist name?

551
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:30,808
Yes.

552
00:21:31,408 --> 00:21:35,179
Thank you very much for visiting Gwallyongsa Temple.

553
00:21:35,279 --> 00:21:37,988
Gwallyongsa Temple is a branch temple of Tongdosa Temple.

554
00:21:37,989 --> 00:21:40,288
Among the 13 treasures of Changnyeong,

555
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:42,518
this temple holds seven of them.

556
00:21:42,519 --> 00:21:44,259
(1 of the 8 Buddhist temples from the Silla Dynasty)

557
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:45,828
Treasures?

558
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,097
- There are seven treasures here?
- Yes.

559
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:49,758
We'll look for them today.

560
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:52,127
- Please come this way.
- Okay.

561
00:21:52,128 --> 00:21:55,638
(Treasures that they'll search at Gwallyongsa Temple)

562
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,939
This is Myeongbujeon Hall.

563
00:21:58,108 --> 00:21:59,308
"Myeongbujeon Hall?"

564
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:01,137
(Myeongbujeon Hall)

565
00:22:01,138 --> 00:22:03,238
It's a place where you wait after death...

566
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,547
before entering the underworld.

567
00:22:05,548 --> 00:22:06,578
A place where you tried.

568
00:22:07,509 --> 00:22:11,019
(What's the treasure inside Myeongbujeon Hall?)

569
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:15,018
In Myeongbujeon Hall, there's Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva.

570
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:16,818
(Wooden Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva)

571
00:22:17,558 --> 00:22:19,288
And Ten Underworld Kings.

572
00:22:19,289 --> 00:22:20,959
(Ten Underworld Kings)

573
00:22:21,658 --> 00:22:25,367
There are 17 wooden statues.

574
00:22:25,368 --> 00:22:26,769
(A total of 17 wooden statues)

575
00:22:26,969 --> 00:22:29,067
(Based on the prayer texts, the exact date...)

576
00:22:29,068 --> 00:22:31,067
(of when it was made and who made it were found.)

577
00:22:31,068 --> 00:22:33,137
(Its importance has been recognized.)

578
00:22:33,138 --> 00:22:35,479
(Completed in March 1652)

579
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,748
As there are 10 kings next to the 3 Buddhas,

580
00:22:38,749 --> 00:22:39,847
they're called Ten Kings.

581
00:22:39,848 --> 00:22:41,148
"Ten Kings?"

582
00:22:42,179 --> 00:22:45,019
Do you see the one wearing a casket?

583
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:48,818
That's King Yeomra whom we're familiar with.

584
00:22:49,588 --> 00:22:50,918
Is that King Yeomra?

585
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:52,357
- The one wearing a wooden board.
- Him?

586
00:22:52,358 --> 00:22:53,888
That's King Yeomra.

587
00:22:54,189 --> 00:22:57,728
(What do the Ten Kings do at the underworld's tribunal?)

588
00:22:57,729 --> 00:22:59,198
Let's say I died.

589
00:22:59,199 --> 00:23:02,568
In 7 days, I'll be tried by the 1st king.

590
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:04,067
(On the 7th day after one's death)

591
00:23:04,068 --> 00:23:07,038
I will be tried by the 2nd king in another 7 days.

592
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,708
(A total of 7 trials every 7 days)

593
00:23:09,709 --> 00:23:12,508
There are seven of them. Seven times seven is 49.

594
00:23:12,509 --> 00:23:13,547
It takes 49 days.

595
00:23:13,548 --> 00:23:15,077
- There's a 49-day ritual.
- Right.

596
00:23:15,078 --> 00:23:17,448
- I see.
- That's where it comes from.

597
00:23:17,449 --> 00:23:18,847
(The 49-day ritual comes from hopes that the deceased get tried.)

598
00:23:18,848 --> 00:23:20,587
Once we get tried,

599
00:23:20,588 --> 00:23:22,459
those who have done good deeds...

600
00:23:22,658 --> 00:23:23,918
go to paradise.

601
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,858
If not, they go to the underworld.

602
00:23:26,588 --> 00:23:28,657
That's what happens at Myeongbujeon Hall.

603
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:30,128
- It's my first time here.
- Me too.

604
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:31,199
Myeongbujeon Hall.

605
00:23:32,098 --> 00:23:33,897
I might be imagining this,

606
00:23:33,898 --> 00:23:35,597
but it feels spiritual.

607
00:23:35,598 --> 00:23:37,699
- There's some energy.
- Right.

608
00:23:38,808 --> 00:23:40,807
- There's a dog.
- Hey, Baekgu.

609
00:23:40,808 --> 00:23:42,038
(They're off to seeing the next treasure.)

610
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:43,239
Hwangu, come here.

611
00:23:43,739 --> 00:23:44,878
Hwangu, come here.

612
00:23:45,308 --> 00:23:46,848
Look at him going his way.

613
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:48,748
That's fascinating too.

614
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:51,548
(Follow me.)

615
00:23:51,949 --> 00:23:55,518
(Where did the dog lead them?)

616
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,657
Usually, when we go to a Buddhist temple,

617
00:23:57,658 --> 00:24:00,658
- the main building is Main Hall.
- Right.

618
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:03,797
Shall we look for the second treasure inside?

619
00:24:03,798 --> 00:24:05,368
- Okay.
- The second treasure?

620
00:24:05,568 --> 00:24:06,798
When we go in,

621
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:08,637
he'll say, "You're the treasure."

622
00:24:08,638 --> 00:24:09,999
(When we go in, he'll say, "You're the treasure.")

623
00:24:10,769 --> 00:24:12,238
Oh, my goodness.

624
00:24:12,239 --> 00:24:14,009
(With anticipation, they enter the Main Hall.)

625
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:19,607
(Mural Painting in Main Hall of Gwallyongsa Temple)

626
00:24:19,608 --> 00:24:20,948
The Buddha Triad in the front

627
00:24:20,949 --> 00:24:22,718
- are the treasure.
- The Buddha Triad?

628
00:24:22,719 --> 00:24:24,748
- The treasure is the three of them?
- Yes.

629
00:24:24,749 --> 00:24:26,518
(Wooden Seated Sakyamuni Buddha Triad...)

630
00:24:26,519 --> 00:24:28,288
(and Pedestals of Gwallyongsa Temple)

631
00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:30,118
(Made in the 1630s, it has traces of Buddha statues in Joseon.)

632
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:33,628
(Pedestals that hold Buddha Triad)

633
00:24:34,259 --> 00:24:38,028
(A beautiful treasure of detailed woodcraft)

634
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:39,628
The atmosphere is different.

635
00:24:42,098 --> 00:24:44,297
- You feel so little in front of it.
- It's a treasure.

636
00:24:44,298 --> 00:24:46,038
Something about it is overwhelming.

637
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:48,508
As they're painted in gold,

638
00:24:48,509 --> 00:24:50,278
you may wonder if it's made of bronze.

639
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:51,749
(Golden Buddha Triad)

640
00:24:51,779 --> 00:24:53,179
It's made of wood inside.

641
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,919
Gold was painted on wood.

642
00:24:54,949 --> 00:24:56,077
Wood?

643
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:57,419
(Gold was painted on wood.)

644
00:24:58,719 --> 00:25:01,087
(Golden Wooden Seated Sakyamuni Buddha Triad...)

645
00:25:01,088 --> 00:25:03,118
(and Pedestals are the second treasure.)

646
00:25:03,259 --> 00:25:04,558
The last treasure is...

647
00:25:04,588 --> 00:25:05,788
inside the Main Hall.

648
00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:06,857
(The last treasure is also inside the Main Hall.)

649
00:25:06,858 --> 00:25:08,327
There's a mural painting.

650
00:25:08,328 --> 00:25:10,198
- Shall we look for it?
- Would you look for it?

651
00:25:10,199 --> 00:25:11,567
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

652
00:25:11,568 --> 00:25:12,929
(They look for a hidden mural painting.)

653
00:25:13,229 --> 00:25:16,039
Including this and that, there are three.

654
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:18,908
(Scanning)

655
00:25:20,068 --> 00:25:22,179
(Slowly)

656
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:25,548
Isn't it this mural painting?

657
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:32,448
(Is the paintwork above the Buddha's head the last treasure?)

658
00:25:32,449 --> 00:25:34,488
Try one more time.

659
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:36,458
Even if we say the answer, don't tell us.

660
00:25:36,459 --> 00:25:38,289
- Try to find it.
- We'll try to figure it out.

661
00:25:38,529 --> 00:25:40,458
Yes, please take a look around.

662
00:25:40,459 --> 00:25:41,759
(They decide to look a little more.)

663
00:25:42,358 --> 00:25:43,658
(What?)

664
00:25:45,769 --> 00:25:47,468
(He follows Jin.)

665
00:25:47,469 --> 00:25:48,969
There's also something in the back.

666
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,968
(A hidden space behind the Buddha statue?)

667
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:53,108
- Yes.
- Is there?

668
00:25:54,908 --> 00:25:56,008
Is there something in the back?

669
00:25:56,009 --> 00:25:57,877
(What's the hidden treasure in the Main Hall?)

670
00:25:57,878 --> 00:26:00,048
- This must be it.
- What?

671
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,817
- Goodness.
- It must be it.

672
00:26:01,818 --> 00:26:03,979
- You can tell that this is it.
- It's definitely it.

673
00:26:06,249 --> 00:26:11,117
(Mural Painting in Main Hall of Gwallyongsa Temple)

674
00:26:11,118 --> 00:26:14,388
(Mural Painting in Main Hall of Gwallyongsa Temple)

675
00:26:15,098 --> 00:26:16,198
This is insane.

676
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,199
(It looks so majestic that you can't take your eyes off of it.)

677
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,699
On top of that, you can see traces of time.

678
00:26:21,098 --> 00:26:22,338
- Sir.
- Yes?

679
00:26:23,199 --> 00:26:24,908
We don't need to look around more.

680
00:26:25,269 --> 00:26:27,407
- This is so powerful.
- You're right.

681
00:26:27,408 --> 00:26:29,539
(It has an aura of treasure that can't be hidden.)

682
00:26:30,439 --> 00:26:33,908
It's about 4m in height and 3m in width.

683
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,248
This is Avalokitesvara.

684
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:36,919
- Avalokitesvara?
- Avalokitesvara?

685
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:39,347
What kind of bodhisattva is it?

686
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:42,758
There are bodhisattvas who help the sick or who tell the future.

687
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:44,289
What kind of bodhisattva is it?

688
00:26:44,558 --> 00:26:46,128
In Buddhism,

689
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,887
we recite the phrase,

690
00:26:47,888 --> 00:26:49,898
"Namuamitabul Gwanseumbosal."

691
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:54,499
(Avalokitesvara who comes from the common phrase)

692
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,969
Whenever you call his name,

693
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:59,009
he will appear anywhere.

694
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:02,377
He'll grant your wish or find a solution for your problems.

695
00:27:02,378 --> 00:27:04,179
That's who Avalokitesvara is.

696
00:27:04,949 --> 00:27:06,248
Do you see...

697
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,618
- a young boy down here?
- Yes.

698
00:27:08,848 --> 00:27:11,648
He is called Sudhana.

699
00:27:11,888 --> 00:27:14,888
Sudhana is asking...

700
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:18,588
for a good Buddhist name from Avalokitesvara.

701
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:20,428
He's asking.

702
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:21,929
(He's asking.)

703
00:27:22,029 --> 00:27:25,229
If you come to this temple...

704
00:27:25,469 --> 00:27:26,998
without hearing any explanation,

705
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:28,969
- you're bound to miss the painting.
- Yes.

706
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,068
People don't usually go to the back.

707
00:27:31,769 --> 00:27:35,638
(You see the Buddha at the center in front of you...)

708
00:27:36,608 --> 00:27:39,908
(and pay respect one more time in the back.)

709
00:27:41,419 --> 00:27:43,377
(The Main Hall of Gwallyongsa Temple's...)

710
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:45,918
(hidden Mural Painting of Avalokitesvara)

711
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:47,647
I was fascinated.

712
00:27:47,648 --> 00:27:49,288
It looks like...

713
00:27:49,289 --> 00:27:52,528
the painting was done after everything was built.

714
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:53,557
You're right.

715
00:27:53,558 --> 00:27:56,057
Usually, paintings are done separately.

716
00:27:56,058 --> 00:27:59,999
It's been 350 years,

717
00:28:00,669 --> 00:28:02,868
- That's...
- and it's still preserved so well.

718
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:04,338
It looks magnificent.

719
00:28:07,509 --> 00:28:08,807
(Turning)

720
00:28:08,808 --> 00:28:09,808
Yes.

721
00:28:09,878 --> 00:28:11,239
Shall we take the quiz now?

722
00:28:11,408 --> 00:28:12,848
- He's crazy about quizzes.
- He is.

723
00:28:13,348 --> 00:28:15,047
We'll give you the quiz.

724
00:28:15,048 --> 00:28:16,077
(Stone Seated Buddha of Gwallyongsa Temple)

725
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:18,388
(Time for Quiz)

726
00:28:18,719 --> 00:28:21,288
We have to use 1 of the 2 hints.

727
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:22,557
(Absorbed in discussing plans)

728
00:28:22,558 --> 00:28:24,719
- Let's use it here.
- I agree.

729
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,327
Then we should go to Jinju and Namhae.

730
00:28:26,328 --> 00:28:28,028
- Going to Namhae is...
- We should get one more...

731
00:28:28,029 --> 00:28:29,897
to drive the other team crazy.

732
00:28:29,898 --> 00:28:31,097
Okay, let's do that.

733
00:28:31,098 --> 00:28:33,827
Let's try to get the answer without using hints by thinking hard.

734
00:28:33,828 --> 00:28:35,268
It could be a multiple-choice question.

735
00:28:35,269 --> 00:28:37,168
You guessed "frog." This should be a piece of cake.

736
00:28:37,169 --> 00:28:39,009
- It could be a multiple choice.
- You're right.

737
00:28:39,709 --> 00:28:40,939
All right.

738
00:28:42,408 --> 00:28:44,607
I'm sure that you studied a lot about Gwallyongsa Temple,

739
00:28:44,608 --> 00:28:47,147
a small temple that's full of treasures.

740
00:28:47,148 --> 00:28:48,148
- Yes.
- Yes.

741
00:28:48,149 --> 00:28:49,878
(Ringing)

742
00:28:50,378 --> 00:28:51,489
Jinju.

743
00:28:51,618 --> 00:28:53,118
- What?
- They got Jinju?

744
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:56,058
They went to Jinju?

745
00:28:59,088 --> 00:29:00,088
It'll be over if they get this.

746
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:02,097
They must be heading to Namhae from there.

747
00:29:02,098 --> 00:29:03,229
- You're right.
- Right.

748
00:29:03,358 --> 00:29:04,557
That was a nice strategy.

749
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:06,529
Did they already get up from the nap?

750
00:29:08,077 --> 00:29:09,748
(Team Guys)

751
00:29:10,948 --> 00:29:14,817
(Team Guys is still sound asleep.)

752
00:29:18,188 --> 00:29:19,688
(Their 30-minute nap is over.)

753
00:29:19,887 --> 00:29:20,927
Is it over?

754
00:29:21,228 --> 00:29:22,927
Yes, it's been 30 minutes.

755
00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:25,527
Where did he go?

756
00:29:25,528 --> 00:29:26,667
Time is up.

757
00:29:27,127 --> 00:29:28,237
I really fell asleep.

758
00:29:28,238 --> 00:29:30,337
- Me too.
- That was a nice nap.

759
00:29:30,498 --> 00:29:31,867
I actually slept.

760
00:29:32,508 --> 00:29:33,807
We must have been tired.

761
00:29:33,808 --> 00:29:35,207
(Jinju National Museum)

762
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,437
- Did we sleep?
- Yes.

763
00:29:36,438 --> 00:29:37,477
(Time for Quiz)

764
00:29:37,478 --> 00:29:39,906
If we answer right after waking up...

765
00:29:39,907 --> 00:29:42,117
I know. I forgot everything that he said.

766
00:29:42,218 --> 00:29:45,217
I'm grateful because I feel recovered.

767
00:29:45,218 --> 00:29:47,048
- I slept well.
- Me too.

768
00:29:47,117 --> 00:29:48,758
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

769
00:29:48,887 --> 00:29:50,458
- I think I snored.
- Me too.

770
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:52,086
Here's the quiz.

771
00:29:52,087 --> 00:29:53,728
(What will be the quiz on Jinju National Museum?)

772
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,998
According to the War Diaries where...

773
00:29:57,327 --> 00:30:00,066
we can find records of Siege of Jinju...

774
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:01,667
- "The War Diaries?" - in order...

775
00:30:01,798 --> 00:30:04,538
to overcome the inferiority in number compared to...

776
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:07,137
the Japanese equipped with weapons and military force,

777
00:30:07,567 --> 00:30:10,778
General Kim Si Min used many tactics.

778
00:30:11,238 --> 00:30:14,547
To prepare for Japanese attacks...

779
00:30:14,548 --> 00:30:16,147
- on the fortress walls, - The fortress walls?

780
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,616
He told his men to bring this from the kitchen.

781
00:30:19,617 --> 00:30:21,447
- Cast iron pot.
- What is this?

782
00:30:21,448 --> 00:30:23,416
You can pour oil into cast iron pots...

783
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:25,156
and pour hot oil over the enemy.

784
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,326
My guess is similar.

785
00:30:27,327 --> 00:30:28,427
Hot water.

786
00:30:29,097 --> 00:30:30,597
They brought hot water.

787
00:30:31,458 --> 00:30:33,197
When they threw it on them, they got burnt.

788
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,567
What can you bring from the kitchen?

789
00:30:35,097 --> 00:30:36,336
- Water?
- Or chili powder?

790
00:30:36,337 --> 00:30:38,037
That's strange. "Chili powder?"

791
00:30:38,038 --> 00:30:39,768
(Or chili powder)

792
00:30:40,637 --> 00:30:42,537
(The Joseon army's spicy tactic?)

793
00:30:42,538 --> 00:30:43,576
Is that not right?

794
00:30:43,577 --> 00:30:47,907
The question is what kind of tool they brought from the kitchen.

795
00:30:48,347 --> 00:30:49,747
They brought something from the kitchen.

796
00:30:49,748 --> 00:30:51,217
Yes, something from the kitchen.

797
00:30:51,218 --> 00:30:52,617
Is it a type...

798
00:30:52,788 --> 00:30:54,616
of tableware?

799
00:30:54,617 --> 00:30:56,187
- It's something like that.
- Or ingredients?

800
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:59,357
Don't separate into categories.

801
00:31:00,558 --> 00:31:01,656
It's not working.

802
00:31:01,657 --> 00:31:04,958
When you see historical movies or dramas,

803
00:31:05,268 --> 00:31:08,227
there's something that they did over the fortress.

804
00:31:08,228 --> 00:31:09,538
They poured things.

805
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:11,636
How about cast iron pots with hot water?

806
00:31:11,637 --> 00:31:13,366
No, you only need to answer...

807
00:31:13,367 --> 00:31:14,667
- the cast iron pots.
- Cast iron pots?

808
00:31:15,077 --> 00:31:16,636
- Cast iron pots?
- We must hurry.

809
00:31:16,637 --> 00:31:17,837
- Shall we make a guess?
- My guess is hot water.

810
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,207
(We just decided on cast iron pots.)

811
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:21,406
What do you mean?

812
00:31:21,407 --> 00:31:23,477
Why would hot water come from the kitchen?

813
00:31:23,478 --> 00:31:25,217
Cast iron pots? Seung Ho, you decide.

814
00:31:25,218 --> 00:31:26,416
(Seung Ho will decide.)

815
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,587
- Chili powder?
- Gosh.

816
00:31:28,188 --> 00:31:30,617
It's either hot water or cast iron pots.

817
00:31:30,917 --> 00:31:33,027
There's a chance that it's chili powder.

818
00:31:33,028 --> 00:31:34,257
(Adding chili powder)

819
00:31:34,258 --> 00:31:36,357
- But chili powder...
- It could kill you.

820
00:31:37,028 --> 00:31:38,566
During a war,

821
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:39,926
you can endure hot water.

822
00:31:39,927 --> 00:31:40,927
(It's killing me.)

823
00:31:40,928 --> 00:31:42,267
- You said...
- I think...

824
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:44,237
- It's something from the kitchen.
- Tell us.

825
00:31:44,238 --> 00:31:45,738
(Tell us, Seung Ho.)

826
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,708
I know why we're so late.

827
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:51,636
Seung Ho is...

828
00:31:51,637 --> 00:31:53,346
The same thing happened last time.

829
00:31:53,347 --> 00:31:55,647
He's quite indecisive, isn't he?

830
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:57,277
Aren't you?

831
00:31:57,278 --> 00:31:59,987
He doesn't like to take responsibility either.

832
00:31:59,988 --> 00:32:01,047
(Suddenly, he says what's been on his mind.)

833
00:32:01,048 --> 00:32:02,356
- From the kitchen...
- Right?

834
00:32:02,357 --> 00:32:04,557
Your opinions always split.

835
00:32:04,558 --> 00:32:05,657
What about you?

836
00:32:05,728 --> 00:32:07,926
- What do you think?
- Honestly, I think it's a knife.

837
00:32:07,927 --> 00:32:09,458
- Knife?
- Knife?

838
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:11,057
Knife from the kitchen?

839
00:32:11,058 --> 00:32:12,267
(Knife from the kitchen?)

840
00:32:12,268 --> 00:32:15,067
They're armed with something better than a knife.

841
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:17,197
They have something better.

842
00:32:17,198 --> 00:32:18,866
- From the kitchen...
- I'll go with hot water.

843
00:32:18,867 --> 00:32:19,967
- Hot water?
- Yes.

844
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,267
(Joy, sorrow)

845
00:32:21,268 --> 00:32:23,478
Hot water from the kitchen?

846
00:32:24,137 --> 00:32:27,547
Based on the question's intent, I think that it's cast iron pot.

847
00:32:27,548 --> 00:32:28,777
So the hot water...

848
00:32:28,778 --> 00:32:30,247
- Let's go with that.
- His answer is right.

849
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,616
What would you bring from the kitchen?

850
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:33,787
- Okay.
- Let's go with cast iron pot.

851
00:32:33,788 --> 00:32:34,846
Cast iron pot?

852
00:32:34,847 --> 00:32:36,086
- One, two, three.
- Two, three.

853
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,156
- Cast iron pot.
- Cast iron pot.

854
00:32:37,157 --> 00:32:38,187
(Answer: Cast iron pot)

855
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:40,327
What General Kim Si Min prepared.

856
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:41,657
Please.

857
00:32:41,998 --> 00:32:43,097
Cast iron pot.

858
00:32:43,397 --> 00:32:44,657
Chili powder? Cast iron pot?

859
00:32:44,798 --> 00:32:46,028
Cast iron pot.

860
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:49,667
- That's correct.
- I told you, kids.

861
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,066
- We wasted...
- Tae Hyun.

862
00:32:51,067 --> 00:32:53,336
Ten minutes here.

863
00:32:53,337 --> 00:32:54,836
- Come on, guys.
- Wait.

864
00:32:54,837 --> 00:32:57,307
Hot water? Chili powder? That's just ridiculous.

865
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,846
Didn't you come up with the answer when I said hot water?

866
00:32:59,847 --> 00:33:01,376
Don't be ridiculous.

867
00:33:01,377 --> 00:33:03,247
- When I said hot water...
- Let's go.

868
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:04,547
- Tae Hyun.
- Goodness.

869
00:33:04,548 --> 00:33:05,947
Didn't you come up with the answer thanks to me?

870
00:33:05,948 --> 00:33:06,987
Goodness.

871
00:33:06,988 --> 00:33:09,058
We lost because of you.

872
00:33:09,258 --> 00:33:10,857
I'll explain.

873
00:33:11,058 --> 00:33:12,657
According to the War Diaries,

874
00:33:12,827 --> 00:33:15,998
big bombes and rocks were set up above the fortress.

875
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:18,356
To attack the enemy on the walls,

876
00:33:18,357 --> 00:33:22,067
many cast iron pots were set up on low walls.

877
00:33:22,137 --> 00:33:24,096
They boiled hot water in them and poured it over the enemy.

878
00:33:24,097 --> 00:33:25,336
- We got it.
- It was right.

879
00:33:25,337 --> 00:33:26,367
Exactly.

880
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:29,576
(In the end, the Japanese army retreated, )

881
00:33:29,577 --> 00:33:31,907
(and General Kim Si Min defended Jinju Fortress.)

882
00:33:32,608 --> 00:33:33,846
My answer was right too.

883
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:35,216
- It was collaborative work.
- Right.

884
00:33:35,217 --> 00:33:36,817
You guessed cast iron pot thanks to me, right?

885
00:33:36,818 --> 00:33:38,787
I said it from the beginning.

886
00:33:38,788 --> 00:33:40,088
- That's not important.
- Hurry up.

887
00:33:40,148 --> 00:33:41,486
Take a look.

888
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:42,788
- Now...
- We'll only look at the menu.

889
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,558
(The menu at this place)

890
00:33:46,927 --> 00:33:50,697
(Thinly sliced beef is coated with yellow eggs.)

891
00:33:51,128 --> 00:33:53,267
(Sizzling)

892
00:33:53,268 --> 00:33:54,867
(Crunchy)

893
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,068
(Light yukjeon with savory beef)

894
00:33:58,268 --> 00:34:01,568
(With spicy and chewy naengmyeon, a beautiful combination)

895
00:34:01,878 --> 00:34:06,377
(Menu in Jinju: Yukjeon and naengmyeon)

896
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:08,147
Yukjeon and Jinju naengmyeon. Choose quickly.

897
00:34:08,148 --> 00:34:09,347
This is expensive.

898
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:12,318
- It's really expensive.
- Goodness.

899
00:34:12,418 --> 00:34:14,147
- Shall we eat it?
- Yukjeon is...

900
00:34:14,148 --> 00:34:16,087
Should we just eat since we're already late?

901
00:34:16,088 --> 00:34:17,318
Is it Korean beef?

902
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:18,787
If it is, we must eat it.

903
00:34:18,788 --> 00:34:20,827
We can make a choice.

904
00:34:21,588 --> 00:34:22,656
Let's go.

905
00:34:22,657 --> 00:34:23,796
(Let's go and eat.)

906
00:34:23,797 --> 00:34:25,157
- Let's go first.
- Seung Ho, you decide.

907
00:34:25,498 --> 00:34:27,127
(Calling Seung Ho again)

908
00:34:27,128 --> 00:34:28,966
Tae Hyun, this is what I think.

909
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:31,037
I think this is why we got behind.

910
00:34:31,038 --> 00:34:32,167
This is why we lost.

911
00:34:32,168 --> 00:34:34,366
If we go to Namhae and occupy it,

912
00:34:34,367 --> 00:34:35,506
the game will be over.

913
00:34:35,507 --> 00:34:37,236
- Once we occupy Namhae.
- Right, it's over.

914
00:34:37,237 --> 00:34:38,946
They're probably close to Namhae now.

915
00:34:38,947 --> 00:34:40,307
No, I really don't think so.

916
00:34:40,308 --> 00:34:42,747
If we hurry up, we'll arrive before them.

917
00:34:42,748 --> 00:34:46,247
Based on my calculation, they'll get there between 3:30pm and 4pm.

918
00:34:46,248 --> 00:34:47,446
I'll trust your judgment.

919
00:34:47,447 --> 00:34:49,517
- They have to get a car wash too.
- Then it'll be 3:30pm.

920
00:34:49,518 --> 00:34:50,986
We'll get there around the same time.

921
00:34:50,987 --> 00:34:52,526
- We still have a chance.
- We do.

922
00:34:52,527 --> 00:34:53,986
- Let's hurry up.
- Instead of wrapping up,

923
00:34:53,987 --> 00:34:56,357
we'll head directly to Namhae.

924
00:34:56,358 --> 00:34:57,497
Please make the victory pose.

925
00:34:57,498 --> 00:34:58,498
Hurry up.

926
00:34:58,499 --> 00:34:59,767
If we make the victory pose,

927
00:34:59,768 --> 00:35:00,966
we'll end up losing.

928
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:02,537
If we didn't do that, we would have won.

929
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:03,768
Okay, one, two.

930
00:35:05,038 --> 00:35:09,907
(Jinju National Museum, Tongdosa Temple)

931
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:11,946
It'll be over if they get this.

932
00:35:11,947 --> 00:35:13,807
They must be heading to Namhae from there.

933
00:35:13,808 --> 00:35:15,977
We must block Namhae no matter what.

934
00:35:15,978 --> 00:35:18,547
We have to go to Namhae.

935
00:35:18,987 --> 00:35:20,886
- Let's do this since we're here.
- We must go to Namhae.

936
00:35:20,887 --> 00:35:22,486
- We'll go directly to Namhae.
- Like this...

937
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:25,386
We'll be late since they'll arrive before us.

938
00:35:25,387 --> 00:35:26,857
Then it will be over.

939
00:35:26,858 --> 00:35:29,297
- We should...
- We can't help it.

940
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:31,757
(At that moment)

941
00:35:32,068 --> 00:35:33,597
Tae Hyun is calling me right now.

942
00:35:33,967 --> 00:35:35,898
(A phone call, all of a sudden?)

943
00:35:36,297 --> 00:35:37,297
Tae Hyun.

944
00:35:37,298 --> 00:35:39,538
Thanks to you, I slept well.

945
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:42,038
Thanks to you,

946
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:45,207
I slept so well that it was infuriating.

947
00:35:45,208 --> 00:35:47,176
- We couldn't do anything.
- Not only did you nap,

948
00:35:47,177 --> 00:35:49,716
but you also had a nice tactic and went all the way to Jinju.

949
00:35:49,717 --> 00:35:50,748
Right.

950
00:35:51,117 --> 00:35:53,147
- Dong Hyun...
- Yes?

951
00:35:53,148 --> 00:35:56,457
While you succeeded at Yongseondae,

952
00:35:56,458 --> 00:35:58,518
we occupied Jinju.

953
00:35:58,628 --> 00:36:01,827
It was Dong Hyun's idea to block you.

954
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:05,466
Unfortunately, you failed.

955
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:07,897
How did you get to Upo Wetland...

956
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:09,366
without hiking?

957
00:36:09,367 --> 00:36:10,597
Why do you think?

958
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:13,906
We didn't expect you to go to Namhae,

959
00:36:13,907 --> 00:36:16,438
but you actually planned on going.

960
00:36:16,577 --> 00:36:17,837
Why did we put you to sleep?

961
00:36:17,838 --> 00:36:20,076
It's because we're almost in Namhae.

962
00:36:20,077 --> 00:36:21,077
(It's hard to tell.)

963
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:22,446
That's impressive.

964
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:23,748
Are you almost there?

965
00:36:23,978 --> 00:36:25,217
I can see the sea.

966
00:36:25,518 --> 00:36:26,518
(Startled)

967
00:36:26,519 --> 00:36:27,917
We'll finish it in Namhae.

968
00:36:27,918 --> 00:36:29,417
(Being shameless)

969
00:36:29,418 --> 00:36:31,156
We worked hard to get to Jinju.

970
00:36:31,157 --> 00:36:33,387
Now, we feel out of it after the nap.

971
00:36:33,628 --> 00:36:35,227
(Well, us too.)

972
00:36:35,228 --> 00:36:37,426
Find a birthday girl or boy...

973
00:36:37,427 --> 00:36:39,697
and go to Tongyeong or Uiryeong.

974
00:36:40,027 --> 00:36:41,397
It's driving us crazy.

975
00:36:41,398 --> 00:36:43,267
It's no one's birthday today!

976
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:44,636
(They still haven't been able to celebrate someone's birthday.)

977
00:36:44,637 --> 00:36:46,466
We're now off to eat.

978
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:47,506
It's driving us crazy!

979
00:36:47,507 --> 00:36:48,507
(Hanging up)

980
00:36:48,508 --> 00:36:50,108
There's still hope.

981
00:36:50,478 --> 00:36:53,006
- They have to celebrate a birthday.
- After hearing...

982
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:55,107
we were almost in Namhae, they gave up.

983
00:36:55,108 --> 00:36:57,216
That's a lie. I'm sure they're headed to Namhae.

984
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:58,748
No way. It can't be that.

985
00:36:59,018 --> 00:37:00,846
- It's true. We still have hope.
- Got it.

986
00:37:00,847 --> 00:37:01,886
Anyway, we need to get this first.

987
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,386
(Let's hurry up with the quiz.)

988
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,387
(Stone Seated Buddha of Gwallyongsa Temple)

989
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,227
- Here's your question.
- Sure.

990
00:37:06,228 --> 00:37:07,427
(Time for Quiz)

991
00:37:07,987 --> 00:37:10,157
Do you see that object next to you made out of wood?

992
00:37:10,927 --> 00:37:12,467
- Sure.
- Yes.

993
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:14,827
What was...

994
00:37:15,327 --> 00:37:18,568
the original purpose of this object?

995
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:20,808
Is that it?

996
00:37:21,467 --> 00:37:23,636
Yes. What was this object used for?

997
00:37:23,637 --> 00:37:24,737
We can't touch it, right?

998
00:37:25,077 --> 00:37:26,208
You can touch it.

999
00:37:26,547 --> 00:37:28,148
Why is this in a temple?

1000
00:37:28,677 --> 00:37:30,177
It's in front of the Daeungjeon of all places.

1001
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,387
You're right. That's where it is.

1002
00:37:34,688 --> 00:37:36,917
You can see these at large temples.

1003
00:37:36,918 --> 00:37:37,918
This isn't the only one.

1004
00:37:37,919 --> 00:37:39,058
Is that so?

1005
00:37:39,558 --> 00:37:40,688
Large temples?

1006
00:37:43,358 --> 00:37:45,327
It looks like a boat.

1007
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:49,167
Why is this here?

1008
00:37:49,168 --> 00:37:50,938
(A suspicious steel hook is on the side.)

1009
00:37:51,097 --> 00:37:52,136
(Hold on)

1010
00:37:52,137 --> 00:37:53,167
Maybe it's that.

1011
00:37:53,168 --> 00:37:56,076
The thing you need to strike a bell.

1012
00:37:56,077 --> 00:37:57,708
That hook reminded me of that too.

1013
00:37:58,108 --> 00:38:00,506
(An object that is hung?)

1014
00:38:00,507 --> 00:38:02,248
Maybe it was used to move the bell.

1015
00:38:02,878 --> 00:38:03,878
To move the bell?

1016
00:38:04,518 --> 00:38:07,546
Could it have been used to manage the statues?

1017
00:38:07,547 --> 00:38:08,887
Like a pulley.

1018
00:38:09,217 --> 00:38:10,757
Were they placed on and off here?

1019
00:38:10,958 --> 00:38:11,958
(That sounds plausible.)

1020
00:38:11,959 --> 00:38:13,358
Maybe it was used to move the statues.

1021
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,387
- I think what you said is right.
- Really?

1022
00:38:15,697 --> 00:38:16,728
It's for the big statue.

1023
00:38:16,827 --> 00:38:19,128
Even if we get it wrong, it's best to get this over with.

1024
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,197
Every large temple...

1025
00:38:21,527 --> 00:38:24,466
has things that are in high places.

1026
00:38:24,467 --> 00:38:26,937
Judging by how it has hooks,

1027
00:38:26,938 --> 00:38:28,607
I'm guessing they needed something...

1028
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,507
to safely carry those objects up and down.

1029
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,547
We think that it was used to carry...

1030
00:38:33,608 --> 00:38:35,676
those objects up and down.

1031
00:38:35,677 --> 00:38:37,176
(Answer: An abject to carry things up and down)

1032
00:38:37,177 --> 00:38:40,217
You think it's a case used to carry things.

1033
00:38:40,248 --> 00:38:41,518
- Right.
- You are...

1034
00:38:42,288 --> 00:38:46,557
(Are we right?)

1035
00:38:46,558 --> 00:38:47,628
You are incorrect.

1036
00:38:49,197 --> 00:38:50,357
We're off to Namhae.

1037
00:38:50,358 --> 00:38:51,358
(We're in trouble.)

1038
00:38:51,958 --> 00:38:54,097
It was better to get it wrong fast since we were never going to get it.

1039
00:38:54,597 --> 00:38:55,966
Still, I was able...

1040
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,897
to play some mind tricks on them.

1041
00:38:57,898 --> 00:39:00,136
No way. I'm sure they're headed to Namhae.

1042
00:39:00,137 --> 00:39:02,377
That's the only option.

1043
00:39:02,378 --> 00:39:04,878
But they were surprised to hear we were almost there.

1044
00:39:05,077 --> 00:39:07,407
- Still, we got this quiz wrong.
- They need to celebrate a birthday.

1045
00:39:07,677 --> 00:39:09,446
Yes, they also have to celebrate one's birthday.

1046
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:12,216
(First, hear about the object.)

1047
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:14,217
That is a rice container.

1048
00:39:14,588 --> 00:39:15,588
What?

1049
00:39:15,589 --> 00:39:16,958
(The real answer: A rice container called a trough)

1050
00:39:17,058 --> 00:39:18,157
I'm sorry,

1051
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:20,756
but who puts this in a rice container?

1052
00:39:20,757 --> 00:39:23,058
- It's obviously not used anymore.
- Of course, not now.

1053
00:39:23,398 --> 00:39:26,427
I told you that it was an object that was used in the past.

1054
00:39:27,527 --> 00:39:28,527
Rice?

1055
00:39:28,528 --> 00:39:29,898
(Startled)

1056
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:34,236
Cooked rice was placed in there so that people could share it.

1057
00:39:34,237 --> 00:39:35,237
(Trough: A rice container)

1058
00:39:35,238 --> 00:39:37,107
(It was used in temples to contain cooked rice...)

1059
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,877
(for monks at ceremonies or in times of war.)

1060
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:40,607
This proves...

1061
00:39:40,608 --> 00:39:42,776
that this temple was quite large.

1062
00:39:42,777 --> 00:39:44,418
It's not considered as big anymore but...

1063
00:39:44,878 --> 00:39:45,947
Really?

1064
00:39:50,058 --> 00:39:52,326
Cooked rice was placed in there back in the day...

1065
00:39:52,327 --> 00:39:53,757
- and carried around.
- I had no idea.

1066
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,326
It never even crossed my mind.

1067
00:39:55,327 --> 00:39:58,156
Even with a few clues, we wouldn't have gotten it right.

1068
00:39:58,157 --> 00:39:59,866
That's why they have this in large temples.

1069
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:01,667
It's not used anymore, but is symbolic.

1070
00:40:01,668 --> 00:40:03,696
That's right. This shows how big this temple used to be.

1071
00:40:03,697 --> 00:40:05,808
- I had no idea.
- Same here.

1072
00:40:06,068 --> 00:40:07,267
Anyway, since you got it wrong,

1073
00:40:07,268 --> 00:40:08,906
you must get moving.

1074
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:10,236
- Sure thing.
- Should we have...

1075
00:40:10,237 --> 00:40:11,277
sugure gukbap or not?

1076
00:40:11,478 --> 00:40:12,478
I don't really care.

1077
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:14,378
- I think we already lost.
- I'm starving.

1078
00:40:14,677 --> 00:40:16,647
I think we already lost.

1079
00:40:16,648 --> 00:40:19,088
It only boils down to them getting the right answer or not.

1080
00:40:19,447 --> 00:40:20,518
It's still doable.

1081
00:40:21,288 --> 00:40:22,617
There are no search results.

1082
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:23,857
I'll do it.

1083
00:40:23,858 --> 00:40:24,858
(Yongmunsa Temple in Namhae)

1084
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:27,486
(From Gwallyongsa Temple to Yongmunsa Temple)

1085
00:40:27,487 --> 00:40:29,697
- It's at the far end.
- That's 100km from here.

1086
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,657
No, 135km. We'll get there in 2 hours.

1087
00:40:32,128 --> 00:40:33,196
How's this?

1088
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:34,426
We'll talk while we eat.

1089
00:40:34,427 --> 00:40:36,768
- Yes, let's eat first.
- We can have sugure gukbap.

1090
00:40:37,137 --> 00:40:39,707
(Before they leave Changnyeong, they cash in the meal card.)

1091
00:40:39,708 --> 00:40:40,767
We'll discuss this over our meal.

1092
00:40:40,768 --> 00:40:43,176
Because of my little mind trick, they must be lost...

1093
00:40:43,177 --> 00:40:45,478
and looking for someone whose birthday is today.

1094
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:47,978
No way. They're on their way to Namhae.

1095
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:49,447
Frog Seok Jin.

1096
00:40:50,248 --> 00:40:51,676
- Let's not give up.
- Frog Seok Jin.

1097
00:40:51,677 --> 00:40:53,017
- Got it.
- Let's go.

1098
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:54,887
- Sure. Let's eat.
- They need to celebrate a birthday.

1099
00:40:55,117 --> 00:40:56,687
- Let's eat first.
- Let's not lose hope.

1100
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:57,716
Sure.

1101
00:40:57,717 --> 00:41:00,358
(They'll eat and muster their energy.)

1102
00:41:00,588 --> 00:41:01,958
Gosh, I'm starving.

1103
00:41:03,427 --> 00:41:05,227
Look at all these handsome men.

1104
00:41:05,228 --> 00:41:06,228
Right?

1105
00:41:06,229 --> 00:41:08,768
Ma'am, sugure gukbap.

1106
00:41:08,938 --> 00:41:10,467
- We'll have 3.
- We'll take 3.

1107
00:41:11,137 --> 00:41:12,268
By the way, what is a sugure?

1108
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:15,006
Sugure is the name...

1109
00:41:15,007 --> 00:41:17,736
for what's between the meat and skin.

1110
00:41:17,737 --> 00:41:19,576
(Sugure gukbap: A traditional dish in Gyeongsang Province...)

1111
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:21,147
(made with what's between a cow's meat and its skin)

1112
00:41:21,148 --> 00:41:22,846
(It is low in fat and packed with gelatin and collagen...)

1113
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:23,847
(which are good for our joints.)

1114
00:41:25,447 --> 00:41:29,157
(A bowl of sugure gukbap will re-energize anyone.)

1115
00:41:29,757 --> 00:41:30,917
(It doesn't help them be in a better mood though.)

1116
00:41:30,918 --> 00:41:32,058
Still, I...

1117
00:41:33,487 --> 00:41:35,628
- The other team played smartly.
- Right.

1118
00:41:37,327 --> 00:41:38,797
All we can do is pray now,

1119
00:41:38,927 --> 00:41:40,168
so time isn't an issue anymore.

1120
00:41:40,797 --> 00:41:42,696
Exactly. We just have to pray for them to get it wrong in Namhae.

1121
00:41:42,697 --> 00:41:43,697
(They pray for Team Guys to get it wrong in Namhae.)

1122
00:41:43,698 --> 00:41:46,437
Don't you have any information about the other team?

1123
00:41:46,438 --> 00:41:48,037
I'm afraid I don't.

1124
00:41:48,038 --> 00:41:49,277
(I won't tell you.)

1125
00:41:49,338 --> 00:41:51,307
Don't they have a way to check our location?

1126
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:52,378
Exactly. Hence my worry.

1127
00:41:52,507 --> 00:41:54,708
Don't you know which chance cards they have used?

1128
00:41:55,148 --> 00:41:56,978
There's no way of knowing that.

1129
00:41:57,378 --> 00:41:58,378
You're being stingy.

1130
00:42:00,447 --> 00:42:01,647
(This will be a gloomy meal.)

1131
00:42:01,648 --> 00:42:02,987
What's that?

1132
00:42:04,318 --> 00:42:05,987
- That was fast.
- They're served fast.

1133
00:42:06,327 --> 00:42:07,687
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1134
00:42:07,688 --> 00:42:08,688
(Sugure gukbap is served which will change the atmosphere.)

1135
00:42:09,257 --> 00:42:10,257
Thank you.

1136
00:42:10,258 --> 00:42:11,757
(Fill your stomachs first.)

1137
00:42:12,668 --> 00:42:13,768
There's meat in here as well.

1138
00:42:15,268 --> 00:42:16,498
I didn't know what this was.

1139
00:42:16,597 --> 00:42:19,136
- It's not fat.
- It must be this.

1140
00:42:19,137 --> 00:42:20,467
It's collagen.

1141
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:22,477
Collagen.

1142
00:42:22,478 --> 00:42:24,577
Tomorrow, your skin will be soft.

1143
00:42:24,938 --> 00:42:26,377
(They will be even handsomer.)

1144
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,406
It's nice to have soft skin.

1145
00:42:27,407 --> 00:42:29,117
Sang Uk, shouldn't you have two bowls?

1146
00:42:29,478 --> 00:42:31,447
I should order another bowl of rice.

1147
00:42:33,088 --> 00:42:35,088
(He first takes a bite of the cow skin lining.)

1148
00:42:35,518 --> 00:42:37,018
(Eyes open wide!)

1149
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:42,327
(After seeing how it tastes, Sang Uk starts devouring the food.)

1150
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:43,628
(The frown of truth)

1151
00:42:43,629 --> 00:42:44,697
That must be it.

1152
00:42:44,858 --> 00:42:47,827
(Yi Kyung tries it too.)

1153
00:42:47,967 --> 00:42:49,367
It's better than expected. It's delicious.

1154
00:42:51,498 --> 00:42:52,537
(It's tasty enough...)

1155
00:42:52,538 --> 00:42:55,137
(to make them forget about the question they got wrong.)

1156
00:42:58,637 --> 00:42:59,776
(In paradise)

1157
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:02,047
This is even better since I haven eaten for a day.

1158
00:43:02,208 --> 00:43:04,046
- It's delicious.
- The sauce and...

1159
00:43:04,047 --> 00:43:05,377
(Jin who was in a bad mood also tries it.)

1160
00:43:05,378 --> 00:43:06,387
(Groaning)

1161
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:11,958
(Anything delicious goes into my mouth.)

1162
00:43:12,117 --> 00:43:13,326
It's delicious.

1163
00:43:13,327 --> 00:43:14,588
(He slowly gets his appetite back.)

1164
00:43:14,688 --> 00:43:15,797
This is crazy.

1165
00:43:17,327 --> 00:43:19,067
Would you like another bowl?

1166
00:43:19,068 --> 00:43:20,227
- No, I'm good.
- He's already done.

1167
00:43:20,228 --> 00:43:21,927
Can I have another bowl of rice?

1168
00:43:22,068 --> 00:43:24,296
- Another bowl of rice?
- Yes, another bowl of rice.

1169
00:43:24,297 --> 00:43:25,497
Rice and soups are amazing.

1170
00:43:25,498 --> 00:43:26,907
The price is insane.

1171
00:43:29,637 --> 00:43:31,677
- You said you wouldn't eat.
- Sang Uk eats on a different level.

1172
00:43:32,177 --> 00:43:35,847
(He's almost swallowing the whole bowl.)

1173
00:43:38,347 --> 00:43:39,386
You eat quite fast.

1174
00:43:39,387 --> 00:43:40,446
(Worried about the roof of his mouth)

1175
00:43:40,447 --> 00:43:41,487
Isn't it hot?

1176
00:43:42,558 --> 00:43:45,557
(Don't worry. He eats a huge spoonful.)

1177
00:43:45,558 --> 00:43:48,588
(Then, he drinks the soup straight from the bowl.)

1178
00:43:50,458 --> 00:43:52,096
Because he's an athlete...

1179
00:43:52,097 --> 00:43:53,596
(He eats in a way that makes us go hungry.)

1180
00:43:53,597 --> 00:43:55,128
He eats a lot of rice.

1181
00:43:55,797 --> 00:43:57,398
Eating was the answer.

1182
00:43:57,438 --> 00:43:58,438
It was right to eat.

1183
00:43:58,439 --> 00:43:59,768
We were lacking energy.

1184
00:44:00,108 --> 00:44:01,168
Yes, eating was the answer.

1185
00:44:01,608 --> 00:44:03,637
(They agree.)

1186
00:44:04,108 --> 00:44:07,077
(They bring up the level of energy by recharging their batteries.)

1187
00:44:08,947 --> 00:44:10,577
(Eating it all down to the last drop)

1188
00:44:13,018 --> 00:44:15,018
(He emptied the bowl.)

1189
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,087
The sugure gukbap was to die for.

1190
00:44:17,088 --> 00:44:19,128
- It was delicious.
- We're now off to Namhae.

1191
00:44:19,288 --> 00:44:20,687
I have the energy again now that I'm full.

1192
00:44:20,688 --> 00:44:21,728

I can't believe we're going to Namhae on the first episode.

1219
00:45:35,668 --> 00:45:37,037
I thought Namhae was too far away...

1220

Remember the first thing we did?

1226
00:45:45,838 --> 00:45:48,446
- We crossed out Namhae.
- I know.

1227
00:45:48,447 --> 00:45:50,216
I asked, "We won't go to Namhae or Tongyeong, right?"

1228
00:45:50,217 --> 00:45:51,648
And you answered, "Of course not."

1229

They're probably headed to Namhae too.

1233
00:45:59,018 --> 00:46:01,187
I think going to Namhae was their plan all along.

1234
00:46:01,188 --> 00:46:02,288
(Team Handsome was probably gunning for Namhae too.)

1235
00:46:02,527 --> 00:46:05,257
They seemed to be in a good mood judging by their voices.

1236
00:46:06,168 --> 00:46:07,627
I felt that too.

1237
00:46:07,628 --> 00:46:09,397
It'll be the best situation...

1238
00:46:09,398 --> 00:46:11,167
if we get there first.

1239
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,268
If they get there before us,

1240
00:46:12,568 --> 00:46:14,107
we'll have to wait for them to get the question wrong.

1241
00:46:14,108 --> 00:46:15,906
(Thinking)

1242
00:46:15,907 --> 00:46:17,636
Here's what I think.

1243
00:46:17,637 --> 00:46:20,748
I believe we'll get there first.

1244
00:46:22,777 --> 00:46:24,446
Can we get there before them?

1245
00:46:24,447 --> 00:46:25,547
Yes, and here's why.

1246
00:46:25,847 --> 00:46:27,446
They were obviously lying,

1247
00:46:27,447 --> 00:46:29,788
- but two things were for sure.
- Which are?

1248
00:46:29,858 --> 00:46:32,486
This is what Yi Kyung meant by us having a good plan.

1249
00:46:32,487 --> 00:46:34,858
They didn't think we'd go to Jinju.

1250
00:46:34,927 --> 00:46:36,898
They don't know that we used the Wishing Happy Birthday Card.

1251
00:46:37,257 --> 00:46:39,097
I'm certain of the two.

1252
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:42,567
What Yi Kyung said at the end...

1253
00:46:42,568 --> 00:46:44,837
might be to avoid suspicions.

1254
00:46:44,838 --> 00:46:46,867
- This was what he said.
- What?

1255
00:46:46,967 --> 00:46:48,937
Go to Tongyeong or Uiryeong.

1256
00:46:48,938 --> 00:46:50,307
He told us to go there.

1257
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:53,107
- Right. He said that.
- So, I hope they are

1258
00:46:53,108 --> 00:46:56,276
- slacking off nearby.
- Yes. In that case,

1259
00:46:56,277 --> 00:46:58,748
let me tell you the positive scenario.

1260
00:46:58,777 --> 00:47:00,987
They went to Upo Wetland.

1261
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:04,487
Since they were in Changnyeong, they went to another place too.

1262
00:47:05,788 --> 00:47:09,157
(Since they've occupied a spot in Changnyeong, )

1263
00:47:09,757 --> 00:47:12,898
(they went to another place too.)

1264
00:47:13,367 --> 00:47:15,966
They were waiting for a quiz at Yongseondae.

1265
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,398
But the alarm for Jinju occupation went off.

1266
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:19,838
(They were about to solve a quiz.)

1267
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:21,236
They occupied Jinju?

1268
00:47:21,237 --> 00:47:23,378
(They heard the alarm.)

1269
00:47:23,878 --> 00:47:25,107
That could have happened.

1270
00:47:25,108 --> 00:47:26,247
For the best scenario,

1271
00:47:26,248 --> 00:47:27,547
they went there and got the quiz wrong.

1272
00:47:27,708 --> 00:47:29,276
Incorrect.

1273
00:47:29,277 --> 00:47:30,577
(They got it wrong.)

1274
00:47:31,217 --> 00:47:33,648
(Are you possessed by a fortune teller?)

1275
00:47:33,947 --> 00:47:37,188
- Psychologically, you wouldn't...
- Right.

1276
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:39,187
- wash the car from the beginning.
- Right.

1277
00:47:39,188 --> 00:47:40,386
- You do that later on.
- Right.

1278
00:47:40,387 --> 00:47:41,657
Then we can go and eat.

1279
00:47:43,128 --> 00:47:44,858
Let's eat after occupying Namhae.

1280
00:47:45,427 --> 00:47:48,367
We will all end up in Namhae in the end.

1281
00:47:49,367 --> 00:47:50,637
It's in 10km.

1282
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:52,197
- We're almost there.
- Yes.

1283
00:47:52,237 --> 00:47:53,507
We'll arrive in 20 minutes.

1284
00:47:54,338 --> 00:47:56,136
(Vibrating)

1285
00:47:56,137 --> 00:47:57,277
What? Who is it?

1286
00:47:57,637 --> 00:47:59,607
(Is Team Handsome...)

1287
00:47:59,608 --> 00:48:02,147
(calling us again?)

1288
00:48:02,148 --> 00:48:03,547
It's Yu Jae Seok.

1289
00:48:03,878 --> 00:48:05,546
- Was it Jae Seok?
- Yes.

1290
00:48:05,547 --> 00:48:06,717
Gosh. Jae Seok.

1291
00:48:07,487 --> 00:48:09,817
(Tae Hyun is calling him as Dong Hyun is driving.)

1292
00:48:09,818 --> 00:48:11,517
- Yes, Tae Hyun.
- Jae Seok.

1293
00:48:11,518 --> 00:48:14,027
- Why?
- Why did you call Dong Hyun?

1294
00:48:14,858 --> 00:48:16,296
I wanted to ask him something.

1295
00:48:16,297 --> 00:48:18,326
- You can ask him.
- Hello, Jae Seok.

1296
00:48:18,327 --> 00:48:21,127
He's looking at the road right now.

1297
00:48:21,128 --> 00:48:22,267
What are you doing with Dong Hyun right now?

1298
00:48:22,268 --> 00:48:24,437
We're shooting a new show.

1299
00:48:24,438 --> 00:48:26,467
Why are you shooting together again?

1300
00:48:26,938 --> 00:48:28,736
We're shooting right now.

1301
00:48:28,737 --> 00:48:30,736
Our team is Dong Hyun, me,

1302
00:48:30,737 --> 00:48:33,107
and Shin Seung Ho, an actor.

1303
00:48:33,108 --> 00:48:35,407
Hello, Jae Seok. It's been a while.

1304
00:48:35,777 --> 00:48:37,116
Gosh. Hey.

1305
00:48:37,117 --> 00:48:38,317
Where are you heading to?

1306
00:48:38,318 --> 00:48:40,787
Us? Jae Seok, we're heading to Namhae.

1307
00:48:40,788 --> 00:48:43,017
I haven't been able to able to answer your call since morning...

1308
00:48:43,018 --> 00:48:44,918
because I've been driving since then.

1309
00:48:45,058 --> 00:48:46,427
- Dong Hyun.
- Yes.

1310
00:48:46,487 --> 00:48:47,727
You'll spend the night there...

1311
00:48:47,728 --> 00:48:49,127
since you're there in the evening.

1312
00:48:49,128 --> 00:48:50,497
- No.
- Today,

1313
00:48:50,498 --> 00:48:53,498
we'll go back after completing a mission in Namhae.

1314
00:48:54,297 --> 00:48:55,596
I don't think you'll complete it.

1315
00:48:55,597 --> 00:48:56,667
(I don't think you'll complete it.)

1316
00:48:56,668 --> 00:48:57,837
- Jae Seok.
- What?

1317
00:48:57,838 --> 00:48:58,866
(What did you say?)

1318
00:48:58,867 --> 00:49:00,007
How does he know?

1319
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,937
It's a close game. The members of the other team...

1320
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:05,537
- are Yi Kyung, Oh Sang Uk, - Yes.

1321
00:49:05,538 --> 00:49:08,907
- and today's guest, Jin of BTS.
- Jin.

1322
00:49:09,447 --> 00:49:10,878
We're playing a game together.

1323
00:49:10,978 --> 00:49:12,418
You'll lose, then.

1324
00:49:12,887 --> 00:49:14,047
Come on.

1325
00:49:14,617 --> 00:49:16,917
- We don't know that.
- We don't know that.

1326
00:49:16,918 --> 00:49:18,287
- Okay.
- Good luck.

1327
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,986
- Okay.
- Bye.

1328
00:49:19,987 --> 00:49:21,027
- Bye.
- I'll call you.

1329
00:49:21,657 --> 00:49:23,728
He wanted to ask you a personal question.

1330
00:49:24,297 --> 00:49:25,297
It's Yongmunsa Temple.

1331
00:49:25,298 --> 00:49:26,627
- We're going there, right?
- Yes.

1332
00:49:26,628 --> 00:49:28,068
It's 500m ahead.

1333
00:49:28,668 --> 00:49:30,867
- Team Handsome won't be there.
- Really?

1334
00:49:31,338 --> 00:49:33,637
(We really hope they aren't there.)

1335
00:49:33,967 --> 00:49:36,277
By the way, if we get the question wrong,

1336
00:49:36,378 --> 00:49:38,777
when we've come all the way to Namhae,

1337
00:49:38,838 --> 00:49:39,846
it'd be too cruel.

1338
00:49:39,847 --> 00:49:42,207
(It'll be an epic fail if they get the quiz wrong...)

1339
00:49:42,208 --> 00:49:44,117
(after arriving faster than the other team.)

1340
00:49:45,518 --> 00:49:47,287
(Overlooking...)

1341
00:49:47,288 --> 00:49:49,418
(the South Sea, )

1342
00:49:49,858 --> 00:49:52,756
(Yongmunsa Temple in Namhae...)

1343
00:49:52,757 --> 00:49:54,628
(is waiting for them.)

1344
00:49:54,788 --> 00:49:56,628
It's time for the final result.

1345
00:49:57,358 --> 00:49:58,796
(Nervous)

1346
00:49:58,797 --> 00:50:00,768
I'm excited and nervous.

1347
00:50:01,068 --> 00:50:02,197
Please.

1348
00:50:02,467 --> 00:50:04,467
Please.

1349
00:50:06,097 --> 00:50:07,768
This must be the parking lot.

1350
00:50:09,438 --> 00:50:11,176
- Totally.
- What? Are they here?

1351
00:50:11,177 --> 00:50:12,537
- No. Hold on.
- They must be here.

1352
00:50:12,538 --> 00:50:14,208
- That's...
- They must be. That just opened.

1353
00:50:14,777 --> 00:50:16,716
- Are they here?
- Hold on.

1354
00:50:16,717 --> 00:50:17,777
(Don't tell us Team Handsome is already here.)

1355
00:50:17,818 --> 00:50:19,846
(The two look for Team Handsome with their eyes wide open.)

1356
00:50:19,847 --> 00:50:21,247
I think they are here.

1357
00:50:21,248 --> 00:50:22,748
(The two look for Team Handsome with their eyes wide open.)

1358
00:50:23,288 --> 00:50:24,958
No? Yes?

1359
00:50:25,117 --> 00:50:26,227
No?

1360
00:50:26,228 --> 00:50:27,228
Are they here or not?

1361
00:50:27,229 --> 00:50:29,128
No? They're not here.

1362
00:50:29,498 --> 00:50:30,826
- What's the color of their car?
- Really.

1363
00:50:30,827 --> 00:50:32,296
- It's dark grey.
- Tae Hyun.

1364
00:50:32,297 --> 00:50:34,397
(Going left and right)

1365
00:50:34,398 --> 00:50:36,966
(The view from a drone)

1366
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,168
- No?
- They're not here.

1367
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:40,737
- They are not here.
- Tae Hyun.

1368
00:50:40,967 --> 00:50:43,137
(I am so happy.)

1369
00:50:43,507 --> 00:50:45,076
- This is the right place, right?
- Yes.

1370
00:50:45,077 --> 00:50:48,006
- They are not here.
- Yes!

1371
00:50:48,007 --> 00:50:49,307
- Tae Hyun.
- We've got this.

1372
00:50:49,308 --> 00:50:50,817
- Are they not here?
- No.

1373
00:50:50,818 --> 00:50:52,478
- Did we come to the right place?
- Yes.

1374
00:50:52,577 --> 00:50:55,088
We've arrived in the parking lot first.

1375
00:50:56,818 --> 00:50:57,986
(Team Guys arrived...)

1376
00:50:57,987 --> 00:51:00,257
(at Yongmunsa Temple's parking lot at 4pm.)

1377
00:51:01,027 --> 00:51:02,127
- Tae Hyun.
- We're so early.

1378
00:51:02,128 --> 00:51:03,696
Tae Hyun, they are really not here. Awesome.

1379
00:51:03,697 --> 00:51:04,926
- They're not here, right?
- Right.

1380
00:51:04,927 --> 00:51:06,057
- They're not here!
- That's right!

1381
00:51:06,058 --> 00:51:07,397
(Team Guys has the chance to win.)

1382
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:08,866
- We made it.
- Wait. Tae Hyun.

1383
00:51:08,867 --> 00:51:10,597
What do you think of the strategy to choose Jinju?

1384
00:51:10,938 --> 00:51:12,037
Let's go up there first.

1385
00:51:12,038 --> 00:51:13,208
(Not commenting on it)

1386
00:51:13,308 --> 00:51:14,906
- The time is...
- Gosh.

1387
00:51:14,907 --> 00:51:16,107
(Getting anxious, )

1388
00:51:16,108 --> 00:51:18,877
(Seung Ho runs abandoning the camera.)

1389
00:51:18,878 --> 00:51:20,076
Tae Hyun, now that we've arrived faster,

1390
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,676
- can we eat first?
- No, we can't.

1391
00:51:21,677 --> 00:51:22,877
No?

1392
00:51:22,878 --> 00:51:24,648
- Not at all.
- Okay.

1393
00:51:25,018 --> 00:51:27,018
It's amazing, Tae Hyun.

1394
00:51:27,248 --> 00:51:28,447
Hello, child.

1395
00:51:29,688 --> 00:51:33,527
(Namhae: Hanging Painting of Yongmunsa Temple)

1396
00:51:33,858 --> 00:51:35,426
Gosh. There are many good spots.

1397
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:36,427
What is that?

1398
00:51:36,428 --> 00:51:38,058
(At that moment, )

1399
00:51:38,157 --> 00:51:41,768
(Team Guys hurries after seeing something.)

1400
00:51:42,228 --> 00:51:44,196
(Handsome Legacy 6)

1401
00:51:44,197 --> 00:51:47,937
(A painting you can't find in the museum)

1402
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:49,006
Gosh.

1403
00:51:49,007 --> 00:51:50,108
(Amazed)

1404
00:51:50,878 --> 00:51:52,906
(As soon as they climb up the stairs, )

1405
00:51:52,907 --> 00:51:55,447
(they can't help but lift their heads...)

1406
00:51:57,418 --> 00:52:01,217
(to see a huge painting hanging on the wall.)

1407
00:52:02,688 --> 00:52:05,587
(But...)

1408
00:52:05,588 --> 00:52:08,788
(is it coming down?)

1409
00:52:09,058 --> 00:52:11,358
The the painting they're putting down...

1410
00:52:11,398 --> 00:52:13,467
is the Hanging Painting of Yongmunsa Temple in Namahe.

1411
00:52:13,998 --> 00:52:15,397
Is that the Hanging Painting?

1412
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:16,696
That's right.

1413
00:52:16,697 --> 00:52:17,967
- That one?
- Yes.

1414
00:52:17,998 --> 00:52:19,767
- We saw the half of it, then.
- Yes.

1415
00:52:19,768 --> 00:52:21,137
We almost missed it completely.

1416
00:52:21,268 --> 00:52:23,007
Usually, they don't take it out.

1417
00:52:23,777 --> 00:52:27,108
(It was revealed only twice in 2014 and in 2023.)

1418
00:52:28,308 --> 00:52:33,117
(It's a cultural heritage we can't see normally.)

1419
00:52:34,318 --> 00:52:38,217
(But it was out in the world for a moment today.)

1420
00:52:41,987 --> 00:52:45,997
(Hanging Painting of Yongmunsa Temple in Namhae)

1421
00:52:45,998 --> 00:52:47,867
(Monk Kwaeyun, 1769)

1422
00:52:49,867 --> 00:52:54,208
(Painted on hemp, 6m wide, 9m tall)

1423
00:52:57,108 --> 00:53:01,407
(In a small temple in Namhae, the southern end, )

1424
00:53:02,748 --> 00:53:07,688
(a heritage has passed on with great care.)

1425
00:53:09,547 --> 00:53:13,858
(Today, the treasure gets some fresh air for a moment...)

1426
00:53:14,657 --> 00:53:15,687
(and goes back to the storage.)

1427
00:53:15,688 --> 00:53:16,857
That's so big.

1428
00:53:16,858 --> 00:53:18,696
(and goes back to the storage.)

1429
00:53:18,697 --> 00:53:19,827
Amazing.

1430
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:22,998
(Amazed)

1431
00:53:23,137 --> 00:53:25,167
Gosh. It's so big, though.

1432
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:27,538
It's huge. How did they paint it back then?

1433
00:53:27,608 --> 00:53:29,337
It's so big and heavy...

1434
00:53:29,338 --> 00:53:31,108
that ten people have to hold it together.

1435
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:32,978
By the way,

1436
00:53:33,407 --> 00:53:35,107
we could not have seen it at all...

1437
00:53:35,108 --> 00:53:36,846
- if we were a little late.
- Right.

1438
00:53:36,847 --> 00:53:38,817
- We could see this much.
- We could feel the vibe.

1439
00:53:38,818 --> 00:53:40,317
It's huge.

1440
00:53:40,318 --> 00:53:42,547
It's so big that it gets me wondering how they painted it.

1441
00:53:42,588 --> 00:53:43,986
If one sees it right after climbing up the stairs,

1442
00:53:43,987 --> 00:53:45,386
- it'd be magnificent, indeed.
- Yes.

1443
00:53:45,387 --> 00:53:46,487
Gosh. Amazing.

1444
00:53:47,628 --> 00:53:49,957
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

1445
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:51,628
- Yes. Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

1446
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,426
By the way, why is it called gwebultang?

1447
00:53:53,427 --> 00:53:55,127
It's called gwebultang...

1448
00:53:55,128 --> 00:53:56,796
because it uses Chinese characters. Gwe means...

1449
00:53:56,797 --> 00:53:58,497
- to hang.
- To hang.

1450
00:53:58,498 --> 00:53:59,636
- Yes.
- I see.

1451
00:53:59,637 --> 00:54:01,867
Tang means a painting.

1452
00:54:02,208 --> 00:54:03,307
So,

1453
00:54:03,308 --> 00:54:05,977
gwebultang means a hanging painting.

1454
00:54:05,978 --> 00:54:08,276
- It's a hanging painting.
- That's right.

1455
00:54:08,277 --> 00:54:09,748
As you can see,

1456
00:54:09,777 --> 00:54:11,717
it's 9m in length.

1457
00:54:11,818 --> 00:54:13,947
And it's 6m in width.

1458
00:54:14,088 --> 00:54:16,116
Generally, the hanging paintings in Korea...

1459
00:54:16,117 --> 00:54:20,087
are the big ones that are about 6m wide and 10m tall.

1460
00:54:20,088 --> 00:54:23,257
So, hanging the painting means...

1461
00:54:23,327 --> 00:54:26,127
The Buddha hall is a small place.

1462
00:54:26,128 --> 00:54:29,367
So, not many people can see it, and it's limited.

1463
00:54:29,498 --> 00:54:31,366
As you can see, as for the hanging painting,

1464
00:54:31,367 --> 00:54:32,997
- everyone can see it.
- They can come.

1465
00:54:32,998 --> 00:54:35,038
They can join others to see it.

1466
00:54:35,808 --> 00:54:38,337
Many people can participate in appreciating the painting.

1467
00:54:38,338 --> 00:54:40,707
That's the significance of it.

1468
00:54:40,708 --> 00:54:43,777
- So, they hang the big painting.
- Yes.

1469
00:54:43,818 --> 00:54:46,047
The Hanging Painting of Yongmunsa Temple in Namhae...

1470
00:54:46,318 --> 00:54:48,847
was created in 1769.

1471
00:54:50,018 --> 00:54:52,318
In the middle is the Buddha.

1472
00:54:52,387 --> 00:54:54,558
And there are two Bodhisattvas on each side.

1473
00:54:54,628 --> 00:54:56,757
One in the middle and the others on each side.

1474
00:54:56,858 --> 00:54:58,498
- They are on each side.
- Bodhisattvas on each side.

1475
00:54:59,358 --> 00:55:01,227
The right one is Manjusri.

1476
00:55:01,228 --> 00:55:03,196
(Manjusri represents the wisdom of Buddhas.)

1477
00:55:03,197 --> 00:55:06,137
On the left is Samantabhadra.

1478
00:55:07,168 --> 00:55:08,807
(Hanging Painting of Yongmunsa Temple in Namhae)

1479
00:55:08,808 --> 00:55:10,107
(Its facial expression and proportion...)

1480
00:55:10,108 --> 00:55:11,506
(depict Buddhist art after the 18th century.)

1481
00:55:11,507 --> 00:55:13,647
The hanging painting is made with hemp.

1482
00:55:13,648 --> 00:55:16,716
So, it is ruined easily by humidity.

1483
00:55:16,717 --> 00:55:19,617
The paint and pigments are affected heavily by the weather.

1484
00:55:19,818 --> 00:55:22,147
- It can't be too hot.
- That's right.

1485
00:55:22,148 --> 00:55:23,486
- It can never be rained on.
- No.

1486
00:55:23,487 --> 00:55:24,558
I see.

1487
00:55:24,588 --> 00:55:26,958
Normally, we can't even see it.

1488
00:55:27,058 --> 00:55:28,927
You can't face it easily.

1489
00:55:29,288 --> 00:55:30,757
Not just for you,

1490
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:32,426
- but for the viewers, - Yes.

1491
00:55:32,427 --> 00:55:35,568
They gave us a permission to take it out.

1492
00:55:35,998 --> 00:55:40,568
(Take a look at the Hanging Painting as a whole once again.)

1493
00:55:41,007 --> 00:55:43,378
(There's another treasure in Yongmunsa Temple in Namhae.)

1494
00:55:43,978 --> 00:55:47,077
(Standing elegantly at the center of the temple, )

1495
00:55:49,447 --> 00:55:52,647
(it's the Daeungjeon of Yongmunsa Temple in Namhae.)

1496
00:55:52,648 --> 00:55:54,216
Before going up to the Daeungjeon,

1497
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,216
you have to see this first.

1498
00:55:56,217 --> 00:55:57,557
- Look at the pillars carefully.
- Yes.

1499
00:55:57,558 --> 00:56:00,527
When you look up, what do you see?

1500
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:01,756
- A dragon?
- A dragon?

1501
00:56:01,757 --> 00:56:03,026
- Yes. It's a dragon.
- Right.

1502
00:56:03,027 --> 00:56:05,398
There's another dragon on the pillar on the left.

1503
00:56:06,197 --> 00:56:09,966
(On the right and left sides of the signboard...)

1504
00:56:09,967 --> 00:56:11,537
(the dragon heads are sculptured.)

1505
00:56:11,538 --> 00:56:13,537
I don't know if you can see it,

1506
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:14,567
but there's another dragon...

1507
00:56:14,568 --> 00:56:15,867
- There is.
- in front of the pillar.

1508
00:56:15,938 --> 00:56:17,507
On the other side,

1509
00:56:17,878 --> 00:56:19,636
- there's a dragon too.
- Yes.

1510
00:56:19,637 --> 00:56:22,608
So, there are four dragons on the front side.

1511
00:56:23,518 --> 00:56:24,776
- Shall we go inside?
- Yes.

1512
00:56:24,777 --> 00:56:26,378
(Welcoming the worshipers)

1513
00:56:29,688 --> 00:56:31,288
- Look up.
- Gosh.

1514
00:56:31,358 --> 00:56:32,486
- Yes.
- Goodness.

1515
00:56:32,487 --> 00:56:36,026
The dragons that will shock you have been waiting for you.

1516
00:56:36,027 --> 00:56:37,597
- Yes.
- That's interesting.

1517
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,257
- Yes.
- There are so many dragons.

1518
00:56:40,367 --> 00:56:41,966
Dragons eat fish too.

1519
00:56:41,967 --> 00:56:43,096
(There's a dragon eating a fish.)

1520
00:56:43,097 --> 00:56:45,838
Please look carefully behind the head of the Buddha.

1521
00:56:46,668 --> 00:56:47,736
What do you see?

1522
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:48,966
There's a dragon.

1523
00:56:48,967 --> 00:56:50,136
- Yes.
- A face of a dragon.

1524
00:56:50,137 --> 00:56:52,176
- There are so many dragons, right?
- Where is it?

1525
00:56:52,177 --> 00:56:53,907
It's brown. You can see it.

1526
00:56:54,847 --> 00:56:56,817
- Did you find it?
- It's like an autostereogram.

1527
00:56:56,818 --> 00:56:58,148
That's right.

1528
00:56:58,478 --> 00:56:59,887
It's so detailed.

1529
00:57:01,547 --> 00:57:02,946
(Another special feature of the Daeungjeon...)

1530
00:57:02,947 --> 00:57:04,457
(at Yongmunsa Temple in Namhae)

1531
00:57:04,458 --> 00:57:06,156
We say...

1532
00:57:06,157 --> 00:57:08,326
that Yongmunsa Temple in Namhae...

1533
00:57:08,327 --> 00:57:10,228
is like an aquarium with various marine life.

1534
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:13,366
Our Daeungjeon is a treasure...

1535
00:57:13,367 --> 00:57:16,127
because there are many fish...

1536
00:57:16,128 --> 00:57:17,637
and marine life.

1537
00:57:18,367 --> 00:57:20,267
- Look this way.
- There?

1538
00:57:20,268 --> 00:57:21,467
- Can you see them well?
- Yes.

1539
00:57:21,808 --> 00:57:22,808
- Gosh. There they are.
- Yes.

1540
00:57:22,809 --> 00:57:26,307
We know it's a turtle. But not one,

1541
00:57:26,308 --> 00:57:28,446
but two turtles are biting a fish.

1542
00:57:28,447 --> 00:57:30,147
- Yes.
- It's giving a piggyback.

1543
00:57:30,148 --> 00:57:31,417
(1 turtle, 2 turtles)

1544
00:57:31,418 --> 00:57:32,877
- What could this be?
- What is that?

1545
00:57:32,878 --> 00:57:33,946
(What is the next marine life?)

1546
00:57:33,947 --> 00:57:35,288
- What does it look like?
- A crab.

1547
00:57:36,018 --> 00:57:37,587
- You're right.
- It's a red snow crab.

1548
00:57:37,588 --> 00:57:39,318
Exactly. It's a crab. Gosh.

1549
00:57:39,487 --> 00:57:41,088
- Yes.
- It also has a fish in its mouth.

1550
00:57:42,327 --> 00:57:45,027
(On the ceiling of the Daeungjeon, )

1551
00:57:45,398 --> 00:57:48,497
(there are marine life representing the Namhae region.)

1552
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:51,196
- There's something over here.
- What is it this time?

1553
00:57:51,197 --> 00:57:53,537
What are these? They are all around here.

1554
00:57:53,538 --> 00:57:55,038
- There are everywhere.
- What's that?

1555
00:57:55,867 --> 00:57:57,807
You can't find this pattern in other temples.

1556
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:58,906
What can it be?

1557
00:57:58,907 --> 00:58:00,346
(What is the unique pattern not found in other temples?)

1558
00:58:00,347 --> 00:58:01,708
Where is this again?

1559
00:58:01,978 --> 00:58:03,076
- The sea.
- The sea.

1560
00:58:03,077 --> 00:58:04,576
Yes. So, it's the sea's...

1561
00:58:04,577 --> 00:58:05,817
(What comes to your mind when you think of the sea?)

1562
00:58:05,818 --> 00:58:06,818
- At sea...
- Waves?

1563
00:58:06,819 --> 00:58:08,517
- Bingo.
- It's the waves.

1564
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:09,747
It's the waves.

1565
00:58:09,748 --> 00:58:11,287
- It's the waves.
- Yes.

1566
00:58:11,288 --> 00:58:12,986
(The waves roll inside the Daeungjeon.)

1567
00:58:12,987 --> 00:58:15,188
Why did they paint the waves?

1568
00:58:15,958 --> 00:58:18,228
When a person dies,

1569
00:58:18,728 --> 00:58:20,527
what do they ride?

1570
00:58:21,027 --> 00:58:22,767
- A ship?
- They ride the ship.

1571
00:58:22,768 --> 00:58:24,196
What is the name of the ship?

1572
00:58:24,197 --> 00:58:26,767
It's a ship led by the dragon of wisdom.

1573
00:58:26,768 --> 00:58:29,268
Wisdom is Banya in Chinese characters.

1574
00:58:29,808 --> 00:58:31,538
So, it's Banya Yongseon, The Dragon Ship of Wisdom.

1575
00:58:31,808 --> 00:58:32,877
Banya Yongseon.

1576
00:58:32,878 --> 00:58:34,708
Now, look up there again.

1577
00:58:35,007 --> 00:58:36,506
In the eyes of the living,

1578
00:58:36,507 --> 00:58:39,148
the Daeungjeon is a house of prayers.

1579
00:58:39,777 --> 00:58:43,217
(It's a place to pray for the people in this world.)

1580
00:58:43,387 --> 00:58:45,588
For the dead, it's...

1581
00:58:45,717 --> 00:58:47,127
- It's a ship.
- That's right.

1582
00:58:47,128 --> 00:58:48,387
You got that right.

1583
00:58:48,487 --> 00:58:51,026
- Is it a ship...
- It's Banya Yongseon.

1584
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,827
- led by dragons?
- Yes.

1585
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:58,867
(The dragons lead the Daeungjeon to the sea of resting.)

1586
00:59:00,268 --> 00:59:03,438
The living can eat the living creatures in the world.

1587
00:59:03,808 --> 00:59:05,378
What about the dead?

1588
00:59:05,838 --> 00:59:07,046
- They can't eat.
- No.

1589
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:09,076
Hoping for them to bring the marine life...

1590
00:59:09,077 --> 00:59:11,277
with them on their way,

1591
00:59:11,677 --> 00:59:15,287
they probably painted so much marine life...

1592
00:59:15,288 --> 00:59:16,788
inside the Daeungjeon here.

1593
00:59:17,617 --> 00:59:18,656
- That's interesting.
- Really?

1594
00:59:18,657 --> 00:59:19,657
Yes.

1595
00:59:19,658 --> 00:59:20,688
(Nodding)

1596
00:59:21,757 --> 00:59:24,026
The monk has finished explaining.

1597
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:26,326
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1598
00:59:26,327 --> 00:59:27,728
(They are done studying about the cultural heritage here.)

1599
00:59:28,797 --> 00:59:32,937
Wait. When the other team gets a question right somewhere,

1600
00:59:32,938 --> 00:59:34,136
we can hear the cuckoo, right?

1601
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:35,637
Are they waiting down there?

1602
00:59:36,007 --> 00:59:38,276
They are waiting down there or failed the mission.

1603
00:59:38,277 --> 00:59:39,737
- There are many possibilities.
- Yes.

1604
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:42,107
Anyway, when we get this right, it's over.

1605
00:59:42,108 --> 00:59:44,346
(When we get this right, it's over.)

1606
00:59:44,347 --> 00:59:46,346
Please.

1607
00:59:46,347 --> 00:59:48,688
(Please.)

1608
00:59:48,887 --> 00:59:50,487
We won't work tomorrow.

1609
00:59:53,257 --> 00:59:55,128
Please. Hey.

1610
00:59:55,228 --> 00:59:57,157
Let's not put our guard down.

1611
00:59:57,628 --> 00:59:59,256
We shouldn't let our guard down. Please. Seriously.

1612
00:59:59,257 --> 01:00:01,596
I have no idea what the question will be because they vary so much.

1613
01:00:01,597 --> 01:00:02,597
It's raining again.

1614
01:00:02,927 --> 01:00:04,296
I don't mind getting rained on.

1615
01:00:04,297 --> 01:00:05,568
- Please.
- I want the joy of victory.

1616
01:00:06,538 --> 01:00:08,967
I've been starving since 7am today.

1617
01:00:09,137 --> 01:00:10,736
- Here we go.
- Please.

1618
01:00:10,737 --> 01:00:11,737
(Desperate)

1619
01:00:12,438 --> 01:00:15,608
Now, I'll give you a quiz on Yongmunsa Temple in Namhae.

1620
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:20,748
The Hanging Painting was only taken out...

1621
01:00:20,918 --> 01:00:23,557
for a big Buddhist ceremony or a ritual.

1622
01:00:23,558 --> 01:00:25,018
- You heard the explanation.
- Yes.

1623
01:00:25,657 --> 01:00:27,987
There's a Buddhist term that was derived from this...

1624
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:29,756
which means,

1625
01:00:29,757 --> 01:00:32,157
"A place where you set up a platform outside..."

1626
01:00:32,297 --> 01:00:34,668
"and listen to the Buddha's words."

1627
01:00:34,967 --> 01:00:37,696
- Now, it's used for a situation...
- Outside?

1628
01:00:37,697 --> 01:00:40,636
Where there's a confused and rowdy state...

1629
01:00:40,637 --> 01:00:43,068
due to a large crowd.

1630
01:00:43,338 --> 01:00:46,077
What is this four-character idiom?

1631
01:00:46,478 --> 01:00:47,608
- Wait a second.
- Gosh.

1632
01:00:47,847 --> 01:00:49,347
(Thinking)

1633
01:00:49,507 --> 01:00:51,046
Please. Why is the quiz so hard?

1634
01:00:51,047 --> 01:00:52,817
(Why is the quiz so hard?)

1635
01:00:52,818 --> 01:00:54,148
(Scratching)

1636
01:00:54,418 --> 01:00:55,486
- Banyashimgyeong?
- This...

1637
01:00:55,487 --> 01:00:57,257
It'll be useless to use the reattempt card.

1638
01:00:58,217 --> 01:00:59,387
(Banyashimgyeong?)

1639
01:00:59,818 --> 01:01:02,887
(Team Guys cannot come up with the answer easily.)

1640
01:01:03,157 --> 01:01:04,256
Let's think about it.

1641
01:01:04,257 --> 01:01:05,557
- What can it be?
- Please tell us the question again.

1642
01:01:05,558 --> 01:01:06,697
Once again.

1643
01:01:07,367 --> 01:01:10,197
- I have no idea.
- What else can it be?

1644
01:01:11,063 --> 01:01:14,301
(Current time: 4pm, Team Handsome)

1645
01:01:14,302 --> 01:01:17,502
Okay. Let's hope they'll get the quiz wrong in Namhae.

1646
01:01:17,503 --> 01:01:19,532
Right. They'll get it wrong for us.

1647
01:01:19,873 --> 01:01:21,773
I think they'll get it wrong in Namhae.

1648
01:01:22,072 --> 01:01:23,072
- Right?
- Yes.

1649
01:01:23,073 --> 01:01:24,942
- The unexpected might happen.
- I'm positive now.

1650
01:01:25,243 --> 01:01:27,011
(They try to cheer up.)

1651
01:01:27,012 --> 01:01:29,281
(Having mixed feelings)

1652
01:01:29,282 --> 01:01:32,052
If they get the last quiz wrong,

1653
01:01:32,282 --> 01:01:34,453
we can win by using the hint.

1654
01:01:34,623 --> 01:01:36,683
We have to get the quiz right in Namhae.

1655
01:01:36,822 --> 01:01:38,853
Right. We have to wash our car too.

1656
01:01:39,623 --> 01:01:42,022
We're late anyway.

1657
01:01:42,023 --> 01:01:44,191
Let's go and wash our car when we see a car wash.

1658
01:01:44,192 --> 01:01:46,562
- Sounds good.
- It's all my fault.

1659
01:01:46,563 --> 01:01:47,732
No.

1660
01:01:49,103 --> 01:01:51,433
(We'll go to Upo Wetland.)

1661
01:01:51,902 --> 01:01:54,603
(His leadership to lead the team)

1662
01:01:54,973 --> 01:01:56,742
(We'll put them to sleep now.)

1663
01:01:56,743 --> 01:01:58,313
(Attacking the other team at the right moment)

1664
01:01:58,442 --> 01:02:00,512
(All right. Frog rock.)

1665
01:02:01,243 --> 01:02:04,453
(An incredible problem-solving ability)

1666
01:02:04,853 --> 01:02:07,182
(The frog. I can't help but love it.)

1667
01:02:07,183 --> 01:02:09,083
Frog? Correct.

1668
01:02:09,652 --> 01:02:13,092
(He became Frog Seok Jin.)

1669
01:02:13,962 --> 01:02:16,461
I lead the teammates into an abyss.

1670
01:02:16,462 --> 01:02:17,532
Come on.

1671
01:02:18,132 --> 01:02:22,003
(Jin blames himself and is disappointed in himself.)

1672
01:02:23,032 --> 01:02:25,071
(In that case...)

1673
01:02:25,072 --> 01:02:27,103
Should we call Dong Hyun?

1674
01:02:27,302 --> 01:02:28,473
And ask where they are?

1675
01:02:29,603 --> 01:02:32,642
(They call Dong Hyun to gasp the situation.)

1676
01:02:32,643 --> 01:02:35,183
(Dong Hyun)

1677
01:02:35,413 --> 01:02:38,183
Is he not picking up to avoid us?

1678
01:02:38,853 --> 01:02:39,882
Is he not going to pick up?

1679
01:02:41,583 --> 01:02:42,723
He's not picking up.

1680
01:02:43,322 --> 01:02:46,051
Don't tell me that they're done. The alarm would have gone off.

1681
01:02:46,052 --> 01:02:47,793
Don't tell me that they went home.

1682
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,063
No way.

1683
01:02:49,862 --> 01:02:52,933
(If they went home, we would have heard the cuckoo.)

1684
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,062
We're entering Namhae-gun now.

1685
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:56,502
(Entering Namhae-gun now)

1686
01:02:56,503 --> 01:02:57,802
(Seung Ho)

1687
01:02:58,732 --> 01:03:00,032
- Yes.
- Seung Ho.

1688
01:03:00,942 --> 01:03:03,171
(Hanging up)

1689
01:03:03,172 --> 01:03:04,972
They decided not to answer our calls,

1690
01:03:04,973 --> 01:03:06,473
so he hung up after hearing your voice.

1691
01:03:06,813 --> 01:03:08,183
After picking it up without thinking?

1692
01:03:08,482 --> 01:03:09,542
(What does it mean for them not to pick up?)

1693
01:03:09,543 --> 01:03:10,953
Is there a reason why they're not picking up?

1694
01:03:12,982 --> 01:03:14,353
They must have gotten the quiz wrong.

1695
01:03:16,152 --> 01:03:18,452
They would have gotten the quiz by now.

1696
01:03:18,453 --> 01:03:19,921
Right. They got it wrong, then.

1697
01:03:19,922 --> 01:03:21,591
(Current time: 5:00pm, By now, they should be done with the quiz.)

1698
01:03:21,592 --> 01:03:24,031
They must have heard the explanation by now.

1699
01:03:24,032 --> 01:03:25,032
- Right.
- They got it wrong, then.

1700
01:03:25,033 --> 01:03:26,492
That's the only explanation.

1701
01:03:26,493 --> 01:03:27,732
They couldn't get the quiz right.

1702
01:03:28,103 --> 01:03:29,132
(Amazed)

1703
01:03:29,232 --> 01:03:30,632
Are they giving us hope suddenly?

1704
01:03:32,203 --> 01:03:34,042
- Then... Sang Uk.
- Yes?

1705
01:03:34,043 --> 01:03:36,203
It's a different story, then, Sang Uk.

1706
01:03:36,442 --> 01:03:37,473
It's totally...

1707
01:03:37,773 --> 01:03:39,643
After washing the car, we can go and win.

1708
01:03:39,743 --> 01:03:41,683
The deity of luck is helping us.

1709
01:03:43,212 --> 01:03:45,652
(Protected by the deity of luck)

1710
01:03:46,313 --> 01:03:47,322
Good News.

1711
01:03:48,953 --> 01:03:50,392
Even the name of the place is Good News.

1712
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:52,893
Exactly. They say no news is good news.

1713
01:03:53,293 --> 01:03:54,722
It's crazy.

1714
01:03:54,723 --> 01:03:56,862
That's a crazy rhyme. This situation is crazy.

1715
01:03:58,063 --> 01:03:59,492
- We're here.
- It's nuts.

1716
01:03:59,493 --> 01:04:00,503
(A car wash in Namhae)

1717
01:04:01,003 --> 01:04:03,131
- Let's splash some water and leave.
- Okay.

1718
01:04:03,132 --> 01:04:04,732
(Free Car Wash: You have to use it before completing the bingo.)

1719
01:04:05,473 --> 01:04:06,672
Hurry up.

1720
01:04:07,143 --> 01:04:08,302
Hurry up.

1721
01:04:08,842 --> 01:04:09,842
Why?

1722
01:04:10,172 --> 01:04:11,572
No. It's nothing. Just hurry.

1723
01:04:11,743 --> 01:04:13,272
He wants us to hurry up.

1724
01:04:13,273 --> 01:04:15,143
- We need cash for this.
- It'll rain.

1725
01:04:16,282 --> 01:04:18,211
It says, "IC card reader."

1726
01:04:18,212 --> 01:04:19,282
(It must be a coin car wash.)

1727
01:04:20,583 --> 01:04:23,793
We just need to do a basic car wash.

1728
01:04:25,753 --> 01:04:27,421
- Take that out.
- What should we do first?

1729
01:04:27,422 --> 01:04:29,591
Get the high-pressure water.

1730
01:04:29,592 --> 01:04:31,433
(Everyone, take your positions.)

1731
01:04:32,933 --> 01:04:34,031
The high-pressure water was there.

1732
01:04:34,032 --> 01:04:35,032
(They are ready to spray the water.)

1733
01:04:35,632 --> 01:04:38,273
Spray it.

1734
01:04:39,203 --> 01:04:41,503
Good. Then, we need to use the foam cannon.

1735
01:04:42,243 --> 01:04:44,712
(Worldwide Handsome sprays the water meticulously.)

1736
01:04:45,143 --> 01:04:46,473
Put it back there.

1737
01:04:47,112 --> 01:04:48,441
Hurry and spray it.

1738
01:04:48,442 --> 01:04:50,211
(A national athlete that sprays the foam does exist.)

1739
01:04:50,212 --> 01:04:51,912
- That's good.
- It's perfect.

1740
01:04:51,913 --> 01:04:53,953
Is it? Now, the high-pressure water.

1741
01:04:54,822 --> 01:04:56,822
(Car Washing Step: Washing)

1742
01:04:57,652 --> 01:04:58,822
How many minutes do we have?

1743
01:04:59,052 --> 01:05:00,362
- 1 minute and 20 seconds.
- 1 minute and 20 seconds.

1744
01:05:01,092 --> 01:05:02,362
Gosh. It won't go away.

1745
01:05:04,092 --> 01:05:05,231
Gosh. I've ruined my clothes.

1746
01:05:05,232 --> 01:05:07,132
(Yi Kyung is spraying the water, but we can't see him.)

1747
01:05:08,532 --> 01:05:11,203
Give it to me. I'll do it.

1748
01:05:12,873 --> 01:05:14,643
(Staring)

1749
01:05:15,342 --> 01:05:17,242
Hey. You're tall, indeed.

1750
01:05:17,243 --> 01:05:19,143
(Standing high)

1751
01:05:19,313 --> 01:05:21,442
(His physique of 192cm even overwhelms the big car.)

1752
01:05:21,743 --> 01:05:22,743
Sang Uk.

1753
01:05:23,112 --> 01:05:25,412
- 30 seconds. 40 seconds.
- 30 seconds.

1754
01:05:25,413 --> 01:05:27,551
- I have to finish it in 30 seconds?
- Wash the front too.

1755
01:05:27,552 --> 01:05:28,722
Because we don't have money?

1756
01:05:28,723 --> 01:05:30,623
(The water should keep coming.)

1757
01:05:30,922 --> 01:05:31,953
Sang Uk!

1758
01:05:33,692 --> 01:05:35,163
I'll do the front.

1759
01:05:36,163 --> 01:05:38,163
(Jin goes back to spraying water.)

1760
01:05:39,663 --> 01:05:41,103
Move out of the way.

1761
01:05:41,902 --> 01:05:42,932
My goodness.

1762
01:05:42,933 --> 01:05:44,103
(He's pretty serious about washing the car.)

1763
01:05:44,873 --> 01:05:47,071
- Hey!
- Move out of the way.

1764
01:05:47,072 --> 01:05:48,942
(The cash wash becomes a water park.)

1765
01:05:50,942 --> 01:05:52,112
Turn around and come this way.

1766
01:05:52,212 --> 01:05:53,212
You can stop.

1767
01:05:53,213 --> 01:05:54,982
(Spray water, spray soap, and rinse.)

1768
01:05:55,712 --> 01:05:56,941
So what's the result of the examination?

1769
01:05:56,942 --> 01:05:58,583
Do you see anything?

1770
01:05:58,982 --> 01:06:00,083
It's clean.

1771
01:06:00,822 --> 01:06:02,252
- All right.
- We'll resume right away.

1772
01:06:02,253 --> 01:06:03,253
Let's go.

1773
01:06:03,993 --> 01:06:06,152
I know that this is the place.

1774
01:06:06,523 --> 01:06:08,191
Twenty minutes is more than enough.

1775
01:06:08,192 --> 01:06:09,522
Not bad.

1776
01:06:09,523 --> 01:06:11,031
They got the quiz wrong anyway.

1777
01:06:11,032 --> 01:06:13,091
That's right. I'm certain that they got the quiz wrong.

1778
01:06:13,092 --> 01:06:14,203
They got the quiz wrong.

1779
01:06:14,603 --> 01:06:16,301
While they're going someplace else,

1780
01:06:16,302 --> 01:06:17,972
they're looking for the birthday person.

1781
01:06:17,973 --> 01:06:19,003
That's right.

1782
01:06:19,103 --> 01:06:20,502
Don't they have it the worst right now?

1783
01:06:20,503 --> 01:06:21,503
(They imagine the best scenario possible.)

1784
01:06:22,572 --> 01:06:25,511
Judging by the way the director hurried us...

1785
01:06:25,512 --> 01:06:27,412
- I think we're in that situation.
- Yes.

1786
01:06:27,413 --> 01:06:28,582
(Is it a positive signal?)

1787
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:29,683
Did they answer incorrectly?

1788
01:06:29,782 --> 01:06:32,012
I think they did. Seriously.

1789
01:06:32,083 --> 01:06:33,151
That's good. Let's go.

1790
01:06:33,152 --> 01:06:34,623
- Let's get off work.
- Seriously.

1791
01:06:35,322 --> 01:06:38,192
I see the sign for Yongmunsa Temple.

1792
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:39,522
We'll be done when we get there.

1793
01:06:40,423 --> 01:06:41,522
One more minute.

1794
01:06:42,222 --> 01:06:43,263
What?

1795
01:06:44,163 --> 01:06:45,362
Why is it so quiet?

1796
01:06:46,232 --> 01:06:47,963
- What? Did it really work?
- Hurry up and get out.

1797
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:51,373
(What will happen to Team Handsome?)

1798
01:06:51,572 --> 01:06:52,633
Let's go.

1799
01:06:53,133 --> 01:06:54,343
Be careful not to slip.

1800
01:06:55,642 --> 01:06:57,312
Is Team Guys really not here?

1801
01:06:58,543 --> 01:07:00,173
They aren't solving a quiz, are they?

1802
01:07:01,743 --> 01:07:03,242
(Namhae: Hanging Painting of Yongmunsa Temple)

1803
01:07:03,243 --> 01:07:04,553
We need to listen to the explanation.

1804
01:07:04,913 --> 01:07:05,953
We need to listen to it.

1805
01:07:06,713 --> 01:07:07,752
Up there...

1806
01:07:07,753 --> 01:07:10,423
(They cross the bridge and enter the temple in darkness.)

1807
01:07:11,522 --> 01:07:13,053
I feel like we're on our way to defeat the boss.

1808
01:07:14,192 --> 01:07:16,793
(The gigantic youngest member likes games.)

1809
01:07:17,392 --> 01:07:18,963
There's the rice bowl.

1810
01:07:19,593 --> 01:07:22,002
- You're right.
- It's there.

1811
01:07:22,003 --> 01:07:23,003
Hey.

1812
01:07:23,763 --> 01:07:25,031
(It made Team Handsome taste defeat at Gwallyongsa Temple, Changnyeong.)

1813
01:07:25,032 --> 01:07:26,601
- It's here.
- You're right.

1814
01:07:26,602 --> 01:07:27,843
It's hajitong where rice is kept.

1815
01:07:28,272 --> 01:07:29,373
- There is...
- It could hold 1,000 servings.

1816
01:07:29,843 --> 01:07:31,342
There's an explanation.

1817
01:07:31,343 --> 01:07:33,243
(It could hold 1,000 servings of rice.)

1818
01:07:33,642 --> 01:07:35,812
Had we come here first, we would've gotten it right.

1819
01:07:37,182 --> 01:07:38,182
Perhaps we wouldn't have read it.

1820
01:07:38,183 --> 01:07:40,822
(Here, the fateful quiz awaits them!)

1821
01:07:41,722 --> 01:07:43,553
Are we the only ones here? Did we really get here first?

1822
01:07:44,253 --> 01:07:45,253
No way.

1823
01:07:45,254 --> 01:07:48,623
(At 6:05pm, Team Handsome arrives at Yongmunsa Temple, Namhae.)

1824
01:07:48,692 --> 01:07:49,923
This is the battlefield.

1825
01:07:50,093 --> 01:07:52,191
We had hung up...

1826
01:07:52,192 --> 01:07:54,531
a big painting called the Hanging Painting.

1827
01:07:54,532 --> 01:07:56,032
- It was a ten-m painting.
- Okay.

1828
01:07:56,463 --> 01:07:58,332
Due to the darkness and rain,

1829
01:07:58,333 --> 01:07:59,832
the painting has been put away.

1830
01:07:59,833 --> 01:08:02,471
Instead, you'll listen to the explanation...

1831
01:08:02,472 --> 01:08:04,742
from the tour guides.

1832
01:08:04,743 --> 01:08:07,242
- Okay.
- The tour guides will enter.

1833
01:08:07,243 --> 01:08:08,243
Please come on out.

1834
01:08:10,782 --> 01:08:12,112
The cameras multiplied.

1835
01:08:14,553 --> 01:08:15,553
You startled me.

1836
01:08:16,883 --> 01:08:18,392
You startled me.

1837
01:08:19,493 --> 01:08:22,892
(You startled me.)

1838
01:08:22,993 --> 01:08:24,191
The cameras multiplied.

1839
01:08:24,192 --> 01:08:25,592
(Team Handsome...)

1840
01:08:25,593 --> 01:08:27,762
(is welcomed by Team Guys.)

1841
01:08:27,763 --> 01:08:30,832
- Hello.
- We waited for you guys.

1842
01:08:30,833 --> 01:08:31,971
We waited for you guys.

1843
01:08:31,972 --> 01:08:33,002
This painting is...

1844
01:08:33,003 --> 01:08:34,003
(A tour guide appears.)

1845
01:08:34,373 --> 01:08:35,672
- over 200 years old.
- No way.

1846
01:08:35,673 --> 01:08:37,442
I told you so.

1847
01:08:37,843 --> 01:08:40,542
I told you so. They didn't pick up because they were waiting here.

1848
01:08:40,543 --> 01:08:42,182
(Happy)

1849
01:08:42,543 --> 01:08:45,013
I told you that they'd welcome us with a round of applause.

1850
01:08:45,112 --> 01:08:46,512
It hasn't even been 30 minutes...

1851
01:08:46,513 --> 01:08:47,521
since we got done.

1852
01:08:47,522 --> 01:08:49,822
We waited because you guys were coming.

1853
01:08:50,222 --> 01:08:52,252
Now, I'll give you a quiz...

1854
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:53,993
about the Yongmunsa Temple, Namhae.

1855
01:08:54,022 --> 01:08:57,092
The Hanging Painting was only taken out...

1856
01:08:57,093 --> 01:08:59,731
for a big Buddhist ceremony or a ritual.

1857
01:08:59,732 --> 01:09:01,003
- You heard the explanation.
- Yes.

1858
01:09:01,833 --> 01:09:04,173
There's a Buddhist term that was derived from this...

1859
01:09:04,432 --> 01:09:08,441
which means, "A place where you set up a platform outside..."

1860
01:09:08,442 --> 01:09:10,673
"and listen to the Buddha's words."

1861
01:09:11,013 --> 01:09:13,842
- Now, it's used for a situation...
- Outside?

1862
01:09:13,843 --> 01:09:17,382
Where there's a confused and rowdy state...

1863
01:09:17,383 --> 01:09:19,282
due to a large crowd.

1864
01:09:19,482 --> 01:09:21,651
What is this four-character idiom?

1865
01:09:21,652 --> 01:09:22,782
Yadanbeopseok.

1866
01:09:25,593 --> 01:09:27,093
- Really?
- My goodness.

1867
01:09:27,362 --> 01:09:29,821
Tae Hyun.

1868
01:09:29,822 --> 01:09:30,962
(Hugging)

1869
01:09:30,963 --> 01:09:32,163
(This is incredible.)

1870
01:09:32,333 --> 01:09:34,002
- Yadanbeopseok.
- Hold on, Tae Hyun.

1871
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,232
- Yadanbeopseok.
- What does "Ya" mean?

1872
01:09:35,432 --> 01:09:36,532
Does it mean "Noise?"

1873
01:09:36,703 --> 01:09:39,231
He talked about a platform or dan.

1874
01:09:39,232 --> 01:09:41,271
- What does "Beop" mean?
- Buddhist sanctuary.

1875
01:09:41,272 --> 01:09:42,703
How about "Seok?"' Does it mean "Sitting?"

1876
01:09:43,402 --> 01:09:45,342
One, two, three.

1877
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,442
- Yadanbeopseok.
- Yadanbeopseok.

1878
01:09:47,312 --> 01:09:48,343
It's correct.

1879
01:09:49,612 --> 01:09:51,753
Tae Hyun, how did you know?

1880
01:09:51,953 --> 01:09:53,552
Tae Hyun. Hold on.

1881
01:09:53,553 --> 01:09:54,553
(They succeeded in the quiz for Namhae's Yongmunsa Temple.)

1882
01:09:54,554 --> 01:09:56,822
How did you know? Tae Hyun.

1883
01:09:56,953 --> 01:09:58,191
You're a genius.

1884
01:09:58,192 --> 01:09:59,821
- You're a genius.
- Don't make a fuss.

1885
01:09:59,822 --> 01:10:01,721
- No yadanbeopseok.
- Tae Hyun.

1886
01:10:01,722 --> 01:10:02,722
(The original meaning of "Yadanbeopseok")

1887
01:10:03,822 --> 01:10:05,632
(I'll hold it outside.)

1888
01:10:05,633 --> 01:10:07,362
(I'll hold it outside the palace!)

1889
01:10:07,602 --> 01:10:10,703
(It'll be a yadanbeopseok!)

1890
01:10:10,932 --> 01:10:13,031
(Yadanbeopseok was an outdoor platform...)

1891
01:10:13,032 --> 01:10:16,673
(that was set up for a big Buddhist ceremony.)

1892
01:10:16,843 --> 01:10:20,913
(This is yadanbeopseok.)

1893
01:10:21,312 --> 01:10:24,412
Team Guys completed the bingo and won.

1894
01:10:24,413 --> 01:10:26,281
- This is incredible.
- My goodness.

1895
01:10:26,282 --> 01:10:28,422
- We did it.
- I told you that this was the way.

1896
01:10:28,423 --> 01:10:30,552
Hey, I told you that this was the way.

1897
01:10:30,553 --> 01:10:32,622
- I told you to watch and see.
- Tae Hyun.

1898
01:10:32,623 --> 01:10:34,093
What would we have done without you?

1899
01:10:34,923 --> 01:10:36,663
- How did you know?
- Bingo.

1900
01:10:37,322 --> 01:10:38,763
- This is incredible.
- Tae Hyun.

1901
01:10:40,902 --> 01:10:43,002
(They savor the joy of victory.)

1902
01:10:43,003 --> 01:10:44,072
Tae Hyun, you're a genius.

1903
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:47,843
(Namhae: Hanging Painting of Yongmunsa Temple)

1904
01:10:48,942 --> 01:10:51,413
(Team Guys completed a bingo.)

1905
01:10:51,642 --> 01:10:52,842
Since you won,

1906
01:10:52,843 --> 01:10:54,843
you can go home right away.

1907
01:10:55,013 --> 01:10:56,682
Really? How about a meal?

1908
01:10:57,383 --> 01:10:59,781
Hurry up and hide. Fall back.

1909
01:10:59,782 --> 01:11:00,883
We need to hide.

1910
01:11:01,022 --> 01:11:02,053
Tae Hyun.

1911
01:11:02,282 --> 01:11:03,681
(They waited for an hour!)

1912
01:11:03,682 --> 01:11:05,392
They're here.

1913
01:11:06,053 --> 01:11:09,061
The tour guides who will explain the painting will enter.

1914
01:11:09,062 --> 01:11:10,093
Please come on out.

1915
01:11:11,663 --> 01:11:15,663
(Proud)

1916
01:11:16,163 --> 01:11:17,602
- You startled me.
- Hello.

1917
01:11:20,743 --> 01:11:22,002
I have a question.

1918
01:11:22,003 --> 01:11:23,742
- We had to take so many guesses.
- Yes.

1919
01:11:23,743 --> 01:11:25,513
"This is what that team thinks."

1920
01:11:25,713 --> 01:11:28,512
We thought that you guys would go to Jinju, not Namhae.

1921
01:11:28,513 --> 01:11:30,242
Why did you guys go to Upo Wetland instead of Namhae?

1922
01:11:30,243 --> 01:11:32,582
We didn't want to hike for 40 minutes.

1923
01:11:32,583 --> 01:11:34,423
- You didn't want to hike.
- That's right.

1924
01:11:34,482 --> 01:11:36,281
- But...
- Had you gone to Namhae...

1925
01:11:36,282 --> 01:11:38,151
from Upo Wetland, we would've lost.

1926
01:11:38,152 --> 01:11:39,792
- That's right.
- Why didn't you guys do that?

1927
01:11:39,793 --> 01:11:42,021
To prevent any unforeseen variables,

1928
01:11:42,022 --> 01:11:43,293
we decided to take this square as well.

1929
01:11:43,862 --> 01:11:44,862
(Their simplicity and greed led to a disastrous result.)

1930
01:11:44,863 --> 01:11:47,231
Then we just needed to go to Haman.

1931
01:11:47,232 --> 01:11:48,931
Since things have come this way,

1932
01:11:48,932 --> 01:11:50,772
we'll focus on completing the bingo without worrying about screen time.

1933
01:11:51,003 --> 01:11:52,102
Suit yourself.

1934
01:11:53,833 --> 01:11:55,071
We should do that, right?

1935
01:11:55,072 --> 01:11:56,243
Why are you asking me?

1936
01:11:56,642 --> 01:11:57,812
You should join us.

1937
01:11:58,072 --> 01:11:59,242
- You...
- Aren't you going to take revenge?

1938
01:11:59,243 --> 01:12:00,742
- You should take revenge.
- You don't need to ask me.

1939
01:12:00,743 --> 01:12:01,913
You should take revenge.

1940
01:12:01,982 --> 01:12:03,482
No, you don't need to ask me.

1941
01:12:03,883 --> 01:12:06,651
Today, you checked out the national heritages...

1942
01:12:06,652 --> 01:12:07,953
of South Gyeongsang Province.

1943
01:12:08,322 --> 01:12:10,482
The first match of Handsome Guys...

1944
01:12:10,553 --> 01:12:11,922
ended as Team Guys' victory.

1945
01:12:11,923 --> 01:12:14,793
Tae Hyun, we did it.

1946
01:12:15,892 --> 01:12:17,093
Monkfish-catching.

1947
01:12:17,293 --> 01:12:18,792
Just in case,

1948
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:21,061
I looked up "Monkfish-catching" on YouTube.

1949
01:12:21,062 --> 01:12:22,402
Do you know what came up first?

1950
01:12:22,602 --> 01:12:24,003
A footage of "Extreme Job."

1951
01:12:24,602 --> 01:12:26,731
- It was on "Extreme Job." - And...

1952
01:12:26,732 --> 01:12:28,802
- if you are unlucky, - It bites.

1953
01:12:28,803 --> 01:12:30,071
- you can lose your wrist.
- Yes.

1954
01:12:30,072 --> 01:12:31,272
You can lose your wrist.

1955
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,972
Monkfish's jaw is so strong...

1956
01:12:33,243 --> 01:12:34,583
that you can lose your wrist.

1957
01:12:35,182 --> 01:12:37,312
He's so annoying. He even looks like a monkfish.

1958
01:12:37,682 --> 01:12:39,513
(It's me, a monkfish.)

1959
01:12:40,682 --> 01:12:42,082
(Laughing)

1960
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:46,391
Tomorrow, the losing team...

1961
01:12:46,392 --> 01:12:49,162
will go and catch monkfish.

1962
01:12:49,163 --> 01:12:51,932
We did receive a call from the boat.

1963
01:12:52,593 --> 01:12:53,692
They can't go out to the sea?

1964
01:12:54,432 --> 01:12:56,133
Yes, they can.

1965
01:12:56,432 --> 01:12:57,873
However,

1966
01:12:58,203 --> 01:13:00,432
the size of the boat is small.

1967
01:13:01,843 --> 01:13:03,771
One or two people will go.

1968
01:13:03,772 --> 01:13:06,271
You'll have a quiz.

1969
01:13:06,272 --> 01:13:08,781
The one who answers the fastest will be exempt...

1970
01:13:08,782 --> 01:13:10,282
from the penalty.

1971
01:13:12,253 --> 01:13:13,413
I have a chance.

1972
01:13:15,652 --> 01:13:18,423
(An extreme job, monkfish-catching is on the line!)

1973
01:13:20,322 --> 01:13:21,463
(The answer is spring.)

1974
01:13:21,722 --> 01:13:23,392
(Frog Rock)

1975
01:13:24,093 --> 01:13:25,732
(He answered all the questions correctly!)

1976
01:13:27,732 --> 01:13:28,833
(The brainy one who's always correct, Jin)

1977
01:13:29,263 --> 01:13:31,572
(Everything you say sounds correct.)

1978
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:33,471
It might be correct.

1979
01:13:33,472 --> 01:13:35,243
(The one who goes with the flow, Yi Kyung)

1980
01:13:35,572 --> 01:13:37,003
(It can't be "Super Radical Gag Family.")

1981
01:13:37,142 --> 01:13:38,811
I think your answer is correct.

1982
01:13:38,812 --> 01:13:40,642
(The quiz rookie, Sang Uk)

1983
01:13:41,043 --> 01:13:44,111
(What will be the result of the monkfish-catching quiz?)

1984
01:13:44,112 --> 01:13:45,182
I'll answer without any expectations.

1985
01:13:46,083 --> 01:13:47,721
Now comes...

1986
01:13:47,722 --> 01:13:49,923
the last quiz of the day.

1987
01:13:50,282 --> 01:13:51,851
(Watching the losing team makes them laugh.)

1988
01:13:51,852 --> 01:13:53,423
It's fun to watch.

1989
01:13:54,392 --> 01:13:55,521
It's fun to watch.

1990
01:13:55,522 --> 01:13:57,763
This isn't easy. My hands are shaking.

1991
01:13:58,963 --> 01:14:02,732
This question comes from the place in Uiryeong...

1992
01:14:02,833 --> 01:14:05,132
you couldn't visit today,

1993
01:14:05,133 --> 01:14:08,572
Righteous Army Museum.

1994
01:14:10,402 --> 01:14:12,843
(A historical place the teams missed today)

1995
01:14:13,513 --> 01:14:15,713
(Uiryeong is the hometown of General Gwak Jae U.)

1996
01:14:16,442 --> 01:14:18,412
(Righteous Army Tower is a 27-m tower that was built...)

1997
01:14:18,413 --> 01:14:20,812
(to honor Red Robe General Gwak Jae U and his 17 soldiers.)

1998
01:14:20,883 --> 01:14:22,553
(Righteous Army Museum)

1999
01:14:26,053 --> 01:14:28,762
There, you can see the items General Gwak Jae U...

2000
01:14:28,763 --> 01:14:30,861
actually used such as his sword, and clothes,

2001
01:14:30,862 --> 01:14:32,362
and saddle.

2002
01:14:36,432 --> 01:14:40,032
(Handsome Quiz on the Penalty!)

2003
01:14:40,472 --> 01:14:42,642
All right. During the Japanese invasions of Korea,

2004
01:14:43,272 --> 01:14:44,513
General Gwak Jae U...

2005
01:14:46,572 --> 01:14:49,712
sealed "Blank" in crates...

2006
01:14:49,713 --> 01:14:51,912
and left them in the mountains...

2007
01:14:51,913 --> 01:14:53,083
of Changnyeong.

2008
01:14:53,612 --> 01:14:55,481
When the Japanese army that was on its way to attack the castle...

2009
01:14:55,482 --> 01:14:57,582
found these crates and opened them,

2010
01:14:57,583 --> 01:14:58,822
the soldiers became shocked.

2011
01:14:59,793 --> 01:15:02,061
General Gwak Jae U ambushed them in this state...

2012
01:15:02,062 --> 01:15:03,293
and won.

2013
01:15:04,493 --> 01:15:06,093
What goes in the blank?

2014
01:15:08,362 --> 01:15:10,931
Are you asking them what was in the crates?

2015
01:15:10,932 --> 01:15:13,032
- That's right.
- What was in the crates?

2016
01:15:13,272 --> 01:15:14,572
(He has an idea.)

2017
01:15:14,673 --> 01:15:15,703
- Three...
- Sang Uk.

2018
01:15:16,102 --> 01:15:17,102
Three things came to my mind.

2019
01:15:17,103 --> 01:15:19,543
(Does Sang Uk have an answer already?)

2020
01:15:21,013 --> 01:15:22,281
(What did General Gwak Jae U seal in the crates?)

2021
01:15:22,282 --> 01:15:23,282
Beehives.

2022
01:15:27,822 --> 01:15:29,822
Is his answer correct? It must be correct.

2023
01:15:31,293 --> 01:15:32,293
Beehives.

2024
01:15:33,692 --> 01:15:36,862
(Is it correcrt?)

2025
01:15:39,192 --> 01:15:40,332
Correct.

2026
01:15:40,333 --> 01:15:42,263
(Beehives is correct!)

2027
01:15:42,562 --> 01:15:45,032
What? What did he say?

2028
01:15:45,232 --> 01:15:46,232
Beehives.

2029
01:15:47,133 --> 01:15:48,173
Beehives.

2030
01:15:49,472 --> 01:15:50,873
You got this right in one go?

2031
01:15:50,972 --> 01:15:52,641
I should stand here now.

2032
01:15:52,642 --> 01:15:54,712
He didn't get any questions right before this one.

2033
01:15:54,713 --> 01:15:56,682
Why didn't you do this earlier?

2034
01:15:58,413 --> 01:16:00,612
- You're one of us now.
- I should stand here now.

2035
01:16:00,682 --> 01:16:02,753
- That team had bad energy.
- Really?

2036
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:04,152
He joined them right away.

2037
01:16:04,553 --> 01:16:05,891
(There's a distance between them now.)

2038
01:16:05,892 --> 01:16:06,892
Beehives.

2039
01:16:06,893 --> 01:16:08,492
It suddenly entered my head.

2040
01:16:08,493 --> 01:16:10,722
They got stung by bees when they opened the crates.

2041
01:16:11,062 --> 01:16:12,262
It suddenly entered my head.

2042
01:16:12,263 --> 01:16:13,762
- It's okay.
- Yes.

2043
01:16:13,763 --> 01:16:15,432
We have to go. We have no choice.

2044
01:16:16,503 --> 01:16:18,173
- All right. Let's go.
- Did you hear it somewhere?

2045
01:16:18,432 --> 01:16:19,832
When I first heard the question,

2046
01:16:19,833 --> 01:16:21,472
I thought of oil.

2047
01:16:21,543 --> 01:16:23,442
I thought that it'd be effective in spreading the Fire.

2048
01:16:24,203 --> 01:16:25,242
By the way,

2049
01:16:25,243 --> 01:16:26,912
(By the way)

2050
01:16:26,913 --> 01:16:28,013
two people won't be necessary.

2051
01:16:31,383 --> 01:16:32,553
- What?
- Two people won't be necessary.

2052
01:16:32,812 --> 01:16:34,112
(Laughing)

2053
01:16:34,152 --> 01:16:35,822
Is one person okay due to the size of the boat?

2054
01:16:36,152 --> 01:16:37,352
Well,

2055
01:16:37,652 --> 01:16:39,493
you guys can go together to prevent loneliness.

2056
01:16:39,753 --> 01:16:41,362
I'm fine with anything. You should decide.

2057
01:16:41,623 --> 01:16:43,222
Jin might get a break.

2058
01:16:43,593 --> 01:16:45,092
- Let's go.
- Go?

2059
01:16:45,093 --> 01:16:46,662
- Let's have one person go.
- One person?

2060
01:16:46,663 --> 01:16:48,202
- Will you be okay with that?
- Yes.

2061
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:49,602
- Won't you be lonely?
- It's okay.

2062
01:16:49,732 --> 01:16:52,731
In that case, here comes the very last quiz of the day.

2063
01:16:52,732 --> 01:16:54,072
(The very last quiz of the day)

2064
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:58,142
This question comes from the place we couldn't visit today,

2065
01:16:59,013 --> 01:17:00,942
Haman Museum.

2066
01:17:02,013 --> 01:17:05,083
(It's a historical place they missed today.)

2067
01:17:05,713 --> 01:17:08,221
(You can see the remains of Ara Gaya in Haman.)

2068
01:17:08,222 --> 01:17:09,422
(World heritage site, Gaya Tumuli)

2069
01:17:09,423 --> 01:17:11,151
(The ancient tombs of Mount Mali are the tombs...)

2070
01:17:11,152 --> 01:17:12,922
(of the kings and royals from Ara Gaya.)

2071
01:17:12,923 --> 01:17:14,722
(It's the biggest tumuli in Korea.)

2072
01:17:16,892 --> 01:17:19,262
(Haman Museum is a museum that focuses on the artifacts...)

2073
01:17:19,263 --> 01:17:21,762
(of Ara Gaya from 1,500 years ago.)

2074
01:17:21,763 --> 01:17:24,232
(It's located in the west side of the ancient tombs.)

2075
01:17:26,532 --> 01:17:27,902
Here comes the question.

2076
01:17:28,642 --> 01:17:32,012
Please take this and study it.

2077
01:17:32,013 --> 01:17:34,413
(The production crew hands something over.)

2078
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:35,611
What's this?

2079
01:17:35,612 --> 01:17:37,082
(What's this?)

2080
01:17:37,083 --> 01:17:38,213
Isn't it a house?

2081
01:17:39,453 --> 01:17:41,352
Let's go and take a look.

2082
01:17:44,553 --> 01:17:45,952
It's pottery.

2083
01:17:45,953 --> 01:17:48,892
That piece of pottery was excavated from the ancient tombs.

2084
01:17:49,293 --> 01:17:51,132
It's one of the pottery pieces called...

2085
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:53,092
the shaped earthenware objects.

2086
01:17:53,093 --> 01:17:54,263
It's one of them.

2087
01:17:55,032 --> 01:17:56,202
Here comes the question.

2088
01:17:56,203 --> 01:17:57,401
(Here comes the question.)

2089
01:17:57,402 --> 01:18:00,832
What was this pottery piece used for?

2090
01:18:00,833 --> 01:18:02,042
Yi Kyung.

2091
01:18:02,043 --> 01:18:03,173
A kettle.

2092
01:18:04,203 --> 01:18:05,343
A kettle?

2093
01:18:05,713 --> 01:18:06,942
It looks that way.

2094
01:18:07,213 --> 01:18:09,083
- It looks like a kettle.
- I know.

2095
01:18:09,713 --> 01:18:10,882
It looks that way,

2096
01:18:10,883 --> 01:18:12,383
- It looks that way.
- I know.

2097
01:18:12,482 --> 01:18:14,053
- Is it correct?
- It looks that way,

2098
01:18:14,413 --> 01:18:15,722
Is it really that easy?

2099
01:18:16,352 --> 01:18:18,993
(It can't be the correct answer.)

2100
01:18:19,593 --> 01:18:20,792
- A kettle?
- Correct.

2101
01:18:20,793 --> 01:18:22,793
(A kettle is correct.)

2102
01:18:23,222 --> 01:18:24,362
(Running away)

2103
01:18:25,163 --> 01:18:26,662
(The one who'll get a break isn't Jin, but me.)

2104
01:18:26,663 --> 01:18:28,062
It looks like a kettle.

2105
01:18:28,263 --> 01:18:29,463
It really looks like a kettle.

2106
01:18:29,503 --> 01:18:31,432
I said it thinking, "This can't be the correct answer."

2107
01:18:32,003 --> 01:18:33,572
I wanted you to answer next.

2108
01:18:35,543 --> 01:18:36,872
(Trudging)

2109
01:18:36,873 --> 01:18:38,173
How could it be a kettle?

2110
01:18:39,272 --> 01:18:43,442
(I can't believe that I'll go and catch monkfish.)

2111
01:18:45,953 --> 01:18:48,252
(How did the first guest end up getting the penalty?)

2112
01:18:48,253 --> 01:18:50,222
What is he going to do?

2113
01:18:50,453 --> 01:18:51,552
- My goodness.
- This is...

2114
01:18:51,553 --> 01:18:52,852
Let's go and catch monkfish.

2115
01:18:53,623 --> 01:18:55,822
- I don't think this is right.
- What?

2116
01:18:55,892 --> 01:18:57,562
I should go.

2117
01:18:58,032 --> 01:18:59,032
In any case,

2118
01:18:59,033 --> 01:19:00,892
the one who will take the penalty of the first shoot...

2119
01:19:01,432 --> 01:19:04,361
is the guest, Jin.

2120
01:19:04,362 --> 01:19:05,532
- Thank you.
- Okay.

2121
01:19:05,902 --> 01:19:07,772
- Thank you.
- Why did it have to be a kettle?

2122
01:19:08,303 --> 01:19:09,503
Thank you.

2123
01:19:11,442 --> 01:19:12,743
Other members...

2124
01:19:13,043 --> 01:19:14,071
can go home.

2125
01:19:14,072 --> 01:19:15,281
We'll go home.

2126
01:19:15,282 --> 01:19:16,982
How will we leave him behind?

2127
01:19:17,682 --> 01:19:18,682
Go.

2128
01:19:19,253 --> 01:19:21,052
I think Jin will be here...

2129
01:19:21,053 --> 01:19:22,851
- I think he'll be here.
- for the next shoot.

2130
01:19:22,852 --> 01:19:24,452
- I have hope.
- Seriously.

2131
01:19:24,453 --> 01:19:26,151
- No. That won't happen.
- I have hope.

2132
01:19:26,152 --> 01:19:27,592
The possibility was up here.

2133
01:19:27,593 --> 01:19:28,593
Now, it's down there.

2134
01:19:28,594 --> 01:19:29,861
- No.
- No.

2135
01:19:29,862 --> 01:19:31,832
We had good chemistry.

2136
01:19:31,833 --> 01:19:33,663
All right. I'm glad you think that.

2137
01:19:34,192 --> 01:19:35,632
He's so annoying.

2138
01:19:35,633 --> 01:19:36,663
(The annoying type who is all talk)

2139
01:19:36,803 --> 01:19:38,531
Thank you for your hard work. You can go home now.

2140
01:19:38,532 --> 01:19:39,901
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2141
01:19:39,902 --> 01:19:41,372
- Go home.
- I'm sorry about this.

2142
01:19:41,373 --> 01:19:43,071
- It's okay.
- My goodness.

2143
01:19:43,072 --> 01:19:44,971
It's okay. I'll have fun.

2144
01:19:44,972 --> 01:19:46,212
- All right.
- Bye.

2145
01:19:46,213 --> 01:19:47,311
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2146
01:19:47,312 --> 01:19:48,442
Bye.

2147
01:19:48,482 --> 01:19:49,742
How about me? Can I go with them?

2148
01:19:49,743 --> 01:19:50,743
(Everyone gets off work except for the guest.)

2149
01:19:52,213 --> 01:19:53,311
Thank you for your hard work.

2150
01:19:53,312 --> 01:19:55,253
(All the members leave.)

2151
01:19:57,453 --> 01:19:58,622
One, two, three.

2152
01:19:58,623 --> 01:19:59,691
(The guest, Jin, announces the end of the first shoot.)

2153
01:19:59,692 --> 01:20:00,793
Thank you for your hard work.

2154
01:20:02,493 --> 01:20:03,663
Thank you for your hard work.

2155
01:20:03,692 --> 01:20:04,692
(Ringing)

2156
01:20:04,963 --> 01:20:06,133
What's this sound?

2157
01:20:06,732 --> 01:20:07,833
(Ringing)

2158
01:20:09,263 --> 01:20:10,561
They ring the bell at this hour.

2159
01:20:10,562 --> 01:20:12,231
- It's what they do usually, right?
- Yes.

2160
01:20:12,232 --> 01:20:14,402
I won't be dragged to the location of the penalty, right?

2161
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:16,042
I'm very scared.

2162
01:20:16,043 --> 01:20:17,572
(I'm very scared.)

2163
01:20:17,873 --> 01:20:18,971
Let's go.

2164
01:20:18,972 --> 01:20:22,213
(What will happen when he carries out the penalty?)

2165
01:20:22,413 --> 01:20:26,312
(Next day)

2166
01:20:26,982 --> 01:20:28,582
(At the sea of Busan, )

2167
01:20:28,583 --> 01:20:30,623
(one man is standing to go and catch monkfish.)

2168
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:35,263
(For the first time, the guest will carry out the penalty!)

2169
01:20:36,923 --> 01:20:39,833
(Let's go and catch monkfish!)

2170
01:20:41,732 --> 01:20:42,862
You know,

2171
01:20:43,703 --> 01:20:46,072
there's a high surf advisory.

2172
01:20:46,503 --> 01:20:47,633
Okay.

2173
01:20:47,833 --> 01:20:50,601
So you won't be able to catch monkfish.

2174
01:20:50,602 --> 01:20:52,013
(So you won't be able to catch monkfish.)

2175
01:20:53,312 --> 01:20:56,642
(5 hours ago)

2176
01:20:56,682 --> 01:21:00,913
A high surf advisory has been issued in the southern sea.

2177
01:21:01,112 --> 01:21:05,253
There will be very strong winds and very high waves.

2178
01:21:05,852 --> 01:21:10,962
Also, the wind velocity will be 15m per second.

2179
01:21:10,963 --> 01:21:13,463
So please stay cautious.

2180
01:21:13,963 --> 01:21:16,703
So you won't be able to catch monkfish.

2181
01:21:16,833 --> 01:21:17,932
Is that so?

2182
01:21:18,072 --> 01:21:19,173
You know that, right?

2183
01:21:19,803 --> 01:21:22,543
Then I'll have no choice but to go home.

2184
01:21:23,373 --> 01:21:25,012
I prepared the right clothes.

2185
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:27,142
It's too bad.

2186
01:21:27,772 --> 01:21:30,882
This is the Busan International Fish Market.

2187
01:21:30,883 --> 01:21:34,252
Fish that are caught in Busan and nearby areas...

2188
01:21:34,253 --> 01:21:35,452
are bought and sold here...

2189
01:21:35,453 --> 01:21:38,151
and sent to the cold storage warehouse.

2190
01:21:38,152 --> 01:21:40,222
(Seafood is bought and sold here and sent to the warehouse.)

2191
01:21:42,022 --> 01:21:44,833
(So what will be the penalty?)

2192
01:21:45,732 --> 01:21:48,763
(His eyes go wide.)

2193
01:21:50,232 --> 01:21:52,772
This is my first time seeing so many mackerels.

2194
01:21:54,633 --> 01:21:55,941
What's this?

2195
01:21:55,942 --> 01:21:58,343
(Mackerel instead of monkfish?)

2196
01:21:59,373 --> 01:22:02,343
(There are tons of mackerels.)

2197
01:22:03,142 --> 01:22:04,212
So...

2198
01:22:04,213 --> 01:22:05,712
(So what's the penalty?)

2199
01:22:05,713 --> 01:22:08,351
Today, you can go home...

2200
01:22:08,352 --> 01:22:11,623
after packing these mackerels in boxes.

2201
01:22:13,123 --> 01:22:16,592
(All of them?)

2202
01:22:16,593 --> 01:22:19,132
The experienced middle-aged women will help you.

2203
01:22:19,133 --> 01:22:20,593
(No worries.)

2204
01:22:21,402 --> 01:22:22,431
(Jin only got 8t of mackerels.)

2205
01:22:22,432 --> 01:22:24,003
The mackerels...

2206
01:22:25,503 --> 01:22:27,602
The pile of mackerels is bigger than my house.

2207
01:22:28,572 --> 01:22:31,673
(The penalty of the day)

2208
01:22:32,442 --> 01:22:35,543
(About 400 mackerels)

2209
01:22:36,383 --> 01:22:39,482
(Pack them all with the experienced aunties!)

2210
01:22:41,013 --> 01:22:42,982
- Hello.
- Hello.

2211
01:22:43,053 --> 01:22:44,851
- Seriously.
- It's nice to meet you.

2212
01:22:44,852 --> 01:22:46,292
- It's nice to meet you.
- Okay.

2213
01:22:46,293 --> 01:22:47,592
What should I do?

2214
01:22:47,593 --> 01:22:50,463
- Put the plastic bag here.
- Okay.

2215
01:22:50,822 --> 01:22:53,332
- Put it here as well.
- Put it here.

2216
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:55,502
Then fill the box with mackerels using your hands.

2217
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:56,902
How many should I put in the box?

2218
01:22:57,102 --> 01:22:58,832
- Should I just fill it up?
- Yes.

2219
01:22:58,833 --> 01:23:00,333
Do it with both hands.

2220
01:23:02,442 --> 01:23:04,071
It's hard to grab them.

2221
01:23:04,072 --> 01:23:06,112
- They're slippery.
- Yes.

2222
01:23:06,873 --> 01:23:10,243
(He fills up the first box.)

2223
01:23:11,482 --> 01:23:13,181
(Filling)

2224
01:23:13,182 --> 01:23:14,611
(Closing)

2225
01:23:14,612 --> 01:23:15,752
Let's put it on the top.

2226
01:23:15,753 --> 01:23:17,422
- Ma'am, I'll carry it.
- No.

2227
01:23:17,423 --> 01:23:18,651
- No.
- It's heavy.

2228
01:23:18,652 --> 01:23:19,923
No, it isn't heavy.

2229
01:23:22,062 --> 01:23:24,262
- I'll do it. Ma'am, get some rest.
- No.

2230
01:23:24,263 --> 01:23:25,532
It'll be hard to do it alone.

2231
01:23:25,763 --> 01:23:26,891
I'll carry it.

2232
01:23:26,892 --> 01:23:29,101
(The first box goes to the rack.)

2233
01:23:29,102 --> 01:23:30,663
My goodness.

2234
01:23:30,862 --> 01:23:33,802
I'm not slowing you down, am I?

2235
01:23:33,803 --> 01:23:35,243
No.

2236
01:23:35,572 --> 01:23:37,401
- If I slow you down...
- It's an honor...

2237
01:23:37,402 --> 01:23:39,673
to work with a handsome uncle.

2238
01:23:40,873 --> 01:23:42,912
Wouldn't I be your nephew?

2239
01:23:42,913 --> 01:23:44,112
- Nephew?
- Yes.

2240
01:23:44,852 --> 01:23:46,883
(They continue packing mackerels as they talk.)

2241
01:23:47,053 --> 01:23:48,623
Why is this unending?

2242
01:23:49,152 --> 01:23:50,681
There are a lot of mackerels.

2243
01:23:50,682 --> 01:23:52,093
It'll end soon.

2244
01:23:52,993 --> 01:23:56,322
I know that, but I just felt like complaining.

2245
01:23:56,923 --> 01:23:59,962
- I just wanted to complain.
- I understand.

2246
01:23:59,963 --> 01:24:01,663
- More mackerels are coming.
- That's right.

2247
01:24:02,862 --> 01:24:04,262
They're pouring more mackerels.

2248
01:24:04,263 --> 01:24:05,333
(They're pouring more mackerels.)

2249
01:24:06,873 --> 01:24:09,202
(Don't forget that you're carrying out a penalty.)

2250
01:24:09,203 --> 01:24:10,642
I'm in the swamp of mackerels.

2251
01:24:10,673 --> 01:24:11,942
There are countless mackerels.

2252
01:24:12,812 --> 01:24:13,872
My goodness.

2253
01:24:13,873 --> 01:24:15,312
(He focuses on packing the mackerels.)

2254
01:24:15,543 --> 01:24:17,812
This is how mackerels come to my dining table.

2255
01:24:17,913 --> 01:24:19,453
We do it by hand.

2256
01:24:19,553 --> 01:24:21,851
- Right.
- It's hard on the aunties.

2257
01:24:21,852 --> 01:24:23,682
Of course, it's hard.

2258
01:24:24,083 --> 01:24:25,851
So buy and eat a lot of mackerels.

2259
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:27,623
- I'll eat a lot of them.
- Okay.

2260
01:24:27,993 --> 01:24:29,162
(Adding)

2261
01:24:29,163 --> 01:24:31,222
(Adding some more)

2262
01:24:31,793 --> 01:24:33,633
(The packing process continues.)

2263
01:24:34,163 --> 01:24:35,231
My goodness.

2264
01:24:35,232 --> 01:24:36,762
Cheer up.

2265
01:24:36,763 --> 01:24:39,102
I'm full of energy.

2266
01:24:40,303 --> 01:24:42,571
It's good to work with a handsome man, right?

2267
01:24:42,572 --> 01:24:43,673
Yes, it's good.

2268
01:24:43,772 --> 01:24:45,472
What do you think of me?

2269
01:24:46,173 --> 01:24:47,242
- You?
- Yes.

2270
01:24:47,243 --> 01:24:49,242
You're a beauty.

2271
01:24:49,243 --> 01:24:50,343
Am I the best?

2272
01:24:50,743 --> 01:24:53,013
You're the absolute best.

2273
01:24:53,383 --> 01:24:55,922
You're a beauty. You're the best.

2274
01:24:55,923 --> 01:24:56,982
(He keeps talking sweetly as he packs.)

2275
01:24:58,493 --> 01:25:00,422
Ma'am, didn't I get faster?

2276
01:25:00,423 --> 01:25:02,093
Yes. You're doing better than before.

2277
01:25:04,392 --> 01:25:06,662
(He works faster as he talks sweetly.)

2278
01:25:06,663 --> 01:25:07,763
My goodness.

2279
01:25:10,902 --> 01:25:12,531
We're nearly done.

2280
01:25:12,532 --> 01:25:15,072
(There are less mackerels now.)

2281
01:25:16,243 --> 01:25:17,271
All right.

2282
01:25:17,272 --> 01:25:20,272
(The mackerels Jin packed)

2283
01:25:21,043 --> 01:25:23,083
(Sizzling)

2284
01:25:24,413 --> 01:25:27,083
(They'll end up on someone's dining table.)

2285
01:25:27,782 --> 01:25:30,352
(Have a bite.)

2286
01:25:30,883 --> 01:25:32,092
Great work.

2287
01:25:32,093 --> 01:25:33,721
- Great work.
- Right.

2288
01:25:33,722 --> 01:25:35,222
We did all of this.

2289
01:25:35,722 --> 01:25:37,123
Gosh, I'm finally straightening my back.

2290
01:25:38,093 --> 01:25:39,133
What about that?

2291
01:25:41,232 --> 01:25:43,763
I did that earlier.

2292
01:25:44,003 --> 01:25:45,803
You have to put them in.

2293
01:25:46,373 --> 01:25:48,642
- I did this earlier.
- Put them in.

2294
01:25:49,572 --> 01:25:51,543
(He starts filling in each spot.)

2295
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:54,413
(Here...)

2296
01:25:55,482 --> 01:25:57,543
(and there)

2297
01:25:58,043 --> 01:26:00,982
(It's over when they are neatly organized.)

2298
01:26:02,053 --> 01:26:04,052
- Great work.
- Great work.

2299
01:26:04,053 --> 01:26:05,093
Gosh.

2300
01:26:06,152 --> 01:26:08,993
(Letting out a sigh)

2301
01:26:09,322 --> 01:26:10,522
Great work.

2302
01:26:10,892 --> 01:26:13,732
(The packaging work is finally done!)

2303
01:26:14,093 --> 01:26:15,503
What?

2304
01:26:15,902 --> 01:26:17,333
Stay right there.

2305
01:26:18,203 --> 01:26:19,232
What?

2306
01:26:19,902 --> 01:26:21,673
(There's something left?)

2307
01:26:22,673 --> 01:26:25,441
(Yes. There's cleaning.)

2308
01:26:25,442 --> 01:26:27,213
All right.

2309
01:26:28,112 --> 01:26:29,842
(Things are finally neatly done.)

2310
01:26:29,843 --> 01:26:33,383
Please tell us about your experience with your penalty.

2311
01:26:34,553 --> 01:26:36,481
Oh Sang Uk and Lee Yi Kyung.

2312
01:26:36,482 --> 01:26:38,891
I don't think I can ever forgive these two.

2313
01:26:38,892 --> 01:26:41,093
Gosh. They got away without me?

2314
01:26:41,892 --> 01:26:43,691
They got away without the guest?

2315
01:26:43,692 --> 01:26:44,822
Gosh.

2316
01:26:45,763 --> 01:26:48,362
Whenever I get the chance,

2317
01:26:49,102 --> 01:26:51,332
I will get my revenge on these two.

2318
01:26:51,333 --> 01:26:55,271
Right. We will wait until that day you get your revenge on them.

2319
01:26:55,272 --> 01:26:56,703
- Yes.
- Great work today.

2320
01:26:56,942 --> 01:26:58,343
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2321
01:26:58,413 --> 01:27:02,312
(The first penalty of Handsome Guys is over.)

2322
01:27:03,716 --> 01:27:05,487
(The second location)

2323
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:07,085
(The region of delicious food)

2324
01:27:07,086 --> 01:27:08,596
(South Jeolla Province)

2325
01:27:08,997 --> 01:27:11,426
Today's Handsome Heritage is traditional liquor.

2326
01:27:11,596 --> 01:27:16,197
(An extraordinary guest appears.)

2327
01:27:16,497 --> 01:27:17,997
(Do you know what this show is about?)

2328
01:27:18,537 --> 01:27:19,537
(I briefly know about it.)

2329
01:27:19,667 --> 01:27:22,777
(The man who just eats well, Choo Sung Hoon)

2330
01:27:23,377 --> 01:27:25,006
(You can eat today.)

2331
01:27:25,207 --> 01:27:27,345
(The Handsome Race...)

2332
01:27:27,346 --> 01:27:29,616
(with all tastes and senses)

2333
01:27:29,617 --> 01:27:32,385
(Is this the start of an eating show?)

2334
01:27:32,386 --> 01:27:33,746
Gosh, I'm full.

2335
01:27:33,747 --> 01:27:35,357
(A sauna all of a sudden?)

2336
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:36,886
I told you.

2337
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:40,657
(They get to their senses and get back into the race.)

2338
01:27:41,027 --> 01:27:42,226
(Did you come thinking that we were going to get it wrong?)

2339
01:27:42,527 --> 01:27:43,857
(We believe you won't get it right.)

2340
01:27:44,157 --> 01:27:45,827
(The result will change if you become careless.)

2341
01:27:46,726 --> 01:27:47,997
(We'll be off first.)

2342
01:27:48,226 --> 01:27:53,265
(The Handsome Radar is turned on.)

2343
01:27:53,266 --> 01:27:55,377
(Things are tense between the two teams.)

2344
01:27:55,577 --> 01:27:57,136
(The result of the race is hard to predict.)

2345
01:27:57,806 --> 01:27:59,976
We'll lose an hour if we don't get it right.

2346
