1
00:00:29,456 --> 00:00:30,855
(Is it traditional food...)

2
00:00:30,856 --> 00:00:32,386
(or fusion food?)

3
00:00:32,986 --> 00:00:34,825
(More cheese...)

4
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,056
(or more toppings?)

5
00:00:37,296 --> 00:00:39,496
(After making the choice...)

6
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:44,635
(Exultation...)

7
00:00:44,636 --> 00:00:47,106
(and regret)

8
00:00:47,266 --> 00:00:49,805
(Anguish and resolution)

9
00:00:49,806 --> 00:00:53,006
(The time of abundance)

10
00:00:53,106 --> 00:00:55,146
(For modern people who suffer from such a dilemma)

11
00:00:55,246 --> 00:00:57,746
(The menu conflict agents, Handsome Guys)

12
00:00:57,876 --> 00:00:59,185
Stand up and keep raising it.

13
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:01,445
- See how far it will go.
- Raise it up.

14
00:01:01,446 --> 00:01:03,055
Get on his shoulders.

15
00:01:03,056 --> 00:01:06,086
(It starts again today.)

16
00:01:06,256 --> 00:01:09,696
(Daehak-ro)

17
00:01:09,996 --> 00:01:12,465
(A neighborhood full of small theaters)

18
00:01:12,466 --> 00:01:15,266
(A space of culture and romance, Daehak-ro)

19
00:01:16,266 --> 00:01:19,736
(Located in the middle of Daehak-ro, a mecca for performance)

20
00:01:20,136 --> 00:01:22,105
(They start the day at a theater center.)

21
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:23,506
- Hello.
- Hello.

22
00:01:23,776 --> 00:01:25,205
Isn't it great...

23
00:01:25,206 --> 00:01:27,046
that no one has to wear makeup today?

24
00:01:27,476 --> 00:01:28,675
I'm so relieved.

25
00:01:28,676 --> 00:01:29,975
It could lead us...

26
00:01:29,976 --> 00:01:31,916
to colluding.

27
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,715
I don't know who the guest is today.

28
00:01:34,716 --> 00:01:36,815
Before he comes, you know what to do, right?

29
00:01:36,816 --> 00:01:39,385
None of us should make it obvious.

30
00:01:39,386 --> 00:01:41,502
What if the word gets out in the broadcasting industry?

31
00:01:41,526 --> 00:01:43,255
You have to pay the food for others.

32
00:01:43,256 --> 00:01:44,525
You also have to wear makeup...

33
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:46,126
and promote the show.

34
00:01:46,196 --> 00:01:47,365
The word could get out.

35
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:49,065
- We could get in trouble.
- Be careful.

36
00:01:49,066 --> 00:01:50,135
For today,

37
00:01:50,136 --> 00:01:51,235
I called my best friend.

38
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,465
- Your best friend?
- Yes.

39
00:01:52,466 --> 00:01:54,235
Has he been on the show before?

40
00:01:54,236 --> 00:01:55,875
Yes, that's right.

41
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:57,275
He came here today...

42
00:01:57,276 --> 00:01:58,945
with determination.

43
00:01:58,946 --> 00:01:59,946
- Today...
- Did he pay...

44
00:01:59,947 --> 00:02:01,105
a lot last time?

45
00:02:01,106 --> 00:02:02,746
I can narrow down the list of candidates.

46
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:04,245
Muay Thai?

47
00:02:04,246 --> 00:02:05,646
(Could it be the man of Muay Thai?)

48
00:02:07,946 --> 00:02:11,315
(Today's guest appears while practicing Muay Thai.)

49
00:02:11,316 --> 00:02:13,855
- The food will be on him today.
- Okay!

50
00:02:13,856 --> 00:02:14,976
(Today's guest, Choi Daniel)

51
00:02:15,356 --> 00:02:17,495
(He radiated his sloppy charm perfectly.)

52
00:02:17,496 --> 00:02:20,425
(Paying)

53
00:02:20,426 --> 00:02:22,566
(Paying again)

54
00:02:22,836 --> 00:02:25,405
(He paid a total of 456 dollars.)

55
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:28,165
(He paid 3 out of 4 times.)

56
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,275
(The right to come back to the show)

57
00:02:29,276 --> 00:02:32,646
(He refuses it coolly.)

58
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:36,746
(After being ill-treated, he became the payment fairy.)

59
00:02:37,246 --> 00:02:39,746
(Fool on the outside, genius on the inside, Choi Daniel)

60
00:02:39,816 --> 00:02:40,845
Today,

61
00:02:40,846 --> 00:02:43,285
- the food will be on him.
- Okay!

62
00:02:43,286 --> 00:02:45,755
We won't pay today.

63
00:02:45,756 --> 00:02:47,755
- Tae Hyun, what do you mean?
- We won't pay.

64
00:02:47,756 --> 00:02:49,655
What are you talking about?

65
00:02:49,656 --> 00:02:51,796
Actually, I came here determined today.

66
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:53,395
How much did I spend last time?

67
00:02:53,396 --> 00:02:54,625
- I spent several hundreds.
- About 400 dollars?

68
00:02:54,626 --> 00:02:55,935
I spent over 400 dollars.

69
00:02:55,936 --> 00:02:56,965
Gosh, I'm scared.

70
00:02:56,966 --> 00:02:58,195
My wallet...

71
00:02:58,196 --> 00:02:59,305
Here's my will.

72
00:02:59,306 --> 00:03:01,405
I'll seal it. I won't take it out...

73
00:03:01,406 --> 00:03:02,605
from my bag.

74
00:03:02,606 --> 00:03:03,805
With all that said,

75
00:03:03,806 --> 00:03:05,246
your wallet is way too thick.

76
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:07,206
- He's well prepared.
- Just in case.

77
00:03:07,546 --> 00:03:09,652
I brought some cash with me in case I can't pay with my card.

78
00:03:09,676 --> 00:03:10,846
I knew it.

79
00:03:10,876 --> 00:03:12,016
- I knew it.
- Just in case.

80
00:03:12,286 --> 00:03:13,345
- You know Daehak-ro very well.
- Just in case.

81
00:03:13,346 --> 00:03:14,645
Just in case.

82
00:03:14,646 --> 00:03:17,316
Some places may not accept card payments.

83
00:03:17,616 --> 00:03:19,855
Anyway, even though it's your second time on the show...

84
00:03:19,856 --> 00:03:21,185
- Please say hello.
- Okay.

85
00:03:21,186 --> 00:03:22,996
- Say hello.
- Hello.

86
00:03:23,226 --> 00:03:24,795
This time, I came determined.

87
00:03:24,796 --> 00:03:27,025
I understand the rules now.

88
00:03:27,026 --> 00:03:28,265
I won't ever have...

89
00:03:28,266 --> 00:03:30,565
to take out my wallet again. I'm Choi Daniel.

90
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:31,965
- It's good to see you.
- Despite saying that,

91
00:03:31,966 --> 00:03:33,165
you took out your wallet...

92
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,336
as soon as you arrived.

93
00:03:34,636 --> 00:03:35,805
- You brought it out.
- Dong Hyun.

94
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:37,575
- I put it back in.
- Daniel.

95
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:39,546
Were the rules difficult last time?

96
00:03:39,946 --> 00:03:41,045
Yes.

97
00:03:41,046 --> 00:03:42,075
By the way...

98
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:43,716
- I'm Shin Seung Ho.
- Seung Ho.

99
00:03:44,316 --> 00:03:45,816
Sang Uk, did you say hello?

100
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:49,356
(Last time in Jamsil...)

101
00:03:50,116 --> 00:03:51,785
Wait, what's your name?

102
00:03:51,786 --> 00:03:54,625
(Wait, what's your name?)

103
00:03:54,626 --> 00:03:58,196
(Daniel didn't know his name until late at night.)

104
00:03:58,626 --> 00:03:59,925
(Shin Seung Ho, spoiled since that moment?)

105
00:03:59,926 --> 00:04:01,526
- "What's your name?" - Take a guess.

106
00:04:02,196 --> 00:04:03,696
Seung Ho, it's good to see you.

107
00:04:03,836 --> 00:04:05,236
Sang Uk, did you say hello?

108
00:04:05,336 --> 00:04:07,005
- You have to introduce yourself.
- My name is Oh Sang Uk.

109
00:04:07,006 --> 00:04:08,876
- "Sang Uk?" - Yes.

110
00:04:08,906 --> 00:04:10,405
- I'm a man.
- Nice to meet you.

111
00:04:10,406 --> 00:04:11,505
During the closing segment,

112
00:04:11,506 --> 00:04:13,245
Daniel will ask for your name.

113
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:14,275
At the last moment, he'll say,

114
00:04:14,276 --> 00:04:15,346
"Who are you again?"

115
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:16,975
He said,

116
00:04:16,976 --> 00:04:18,276
"What's your name?"

117
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:21,385
We're in Daehak-ro.

118
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,415
Let me explain...

119
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:25,116
where the name comes from.

120
00:04:25,926 --> 00:04:30,296
This place is also known as Broadway of Korea.

121
00:04:30,926 --> 00:04:34,566
It naturally settled as a place for arts and theater.

122
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:35,896
That's how it came to be.

123
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,835
Many theater companies that have shaped the history...

124
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:40,506
- of Korean theater are here.
- Right.

125
00:04:40,636 --> 00:04:42,305
Some examples are Hakchon, Chaimu,

126
00:04:42,306 --> 00:04:43,505
and Hangyang Repertory.

127
00:04:43,506 --> 00:04:46,005
It's the birthplace of many leading actors in Korea...

128
00:04:46,006 --> 00:04:48,945
who are the pillars of the Korean theater scene.

129
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:50,452
(Numerous theater companies started in Daehak-ro.)

130
00:04:50,476 --> 00:04:53,146
(We asked the actors who are leading Daehak-ro.)

131
00:04:53,216 --> 00:04:55,255
What does Daehak-ro mean to actors?

132
00:04:55,256 --> 00:04:56,592
(What does Daehak-ro mean to actors?)

133
00:04:56,616 --> 00:04:59,055
You feel energized...

134
00:04:59,056 --> 00:05:00,985
just by being at this place.

135
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:03,025
As people love theater so much,

136
00:05:03,026 --> 00:05:04,925
there is energy...

137
00:05:04,926 --> 00:05:06,726
unique to this neighborhood.

138
00:05:07,026 --> 00:05:10,095
This place is my second home.

139
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:11,136
(A 2nd home to the actors)

140
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:13,505
(Handsome Guys go inside Daehak-ro...)

141
00:05:13,506 --> 00:05:17,605
(that's full of romance and passion.)

142
00:05:17,606 --> 00:05:19,946
For the actors,

143
00:05:20,046 --> 00:05:21,645
isn't Daehak-ro very familiar?

144
00:05:21,646 --> 00:05:23,216
I also performed in a musical here.

145
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:24,675
- I saw you in it.
- Right.

146
00:05:24,676 --> 00:05:25,885
- I did.
- You did.

147
00:05:25,886 --> 00:05:27,785
- You dressed up as an idol star.
- "Alta Boys."

148
00:05:27,786 --> 00:05:29,386
- "Alta Boys?" - I was in that too.

149
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:31,215
- What about you, Seung Ho?
- Me?

150
00:05:31,216 --> 00:05:33,026
Before I debuted,

151
00:05:33,156 --> 00:05:35,055
I commuted from Yongin to Daehak-ro...

152
00:05:35,056 --> 00:05:36,326
to take classes every day.

153
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:38,095
- You took classes here?
- Yes, over there.

154
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:39,365
There's an acting school.

155
00:05:39,366 --> 00:05:40,525
It's in front of Sungkyunkwan University.

156
00:05:40,526 --> 00:05:42,066
It feels different to be here again.

157
00:05:42,136 --> 00:05:43,795
I can't believe that I'm back here for a shoot.

158
00:05:43,796 --> 00:05:45,066
(A shoot at a memorable place)

159
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,665
Actors have affiliations.

160
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:48,835
Affiliated with Dongsung.

161
00:05:48,836 --> 00:05:51,205
- What's that?
- Theater actors.

162
00:05:51,206 --> 00:05:52,245
- Their affiliation?
- Yes.

163
00:05:52,246 --> 00:05:54,076
We belong to the entertainment...

164
00:05:54,306 --> 00:05:55,345
and broadcasting industry.

165
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:56,916
Everyone has an affiliation.

166
00:05:57,846 --> 00:05:59,446
He's affiliated with sports.

167
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:01,115
- Yes, I am.
- Right?

168
00:06:01,116 --> 00:06:02,385
He's another athlete.

169
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:03,416
He's number one.

170
00:06:04,586 --> 00:06:05,655
- Are you an athlete?
- Yes.

171
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,562
- What do you play?
- Which sport do you think it is?

172
00:06:07,586 --> 00:06:08,726
Basketball?

173
00:06:09,156 --> 00:06:10,295
What does he do?

174
00:06:10,296 --> 00:06:11,755
Don't you have a TV at home?

175
00:06:11,756 --> 00:06:13,326
Yes, I do.

176
00:06:13,966 --> 00:06:15,535
- He's handsome.
- Daniel is impressive.

177
00:06:15,536 --> 00:06:16,966
Did you think that he was a model?

178
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:18,495
I'll show you a pose.

179
00:06:18,496 --> 00:06:19,636
(Guess Sang Uk's occupation)

180
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:20,736
Soccer?

181
00:06:20,836 --> 00:06:22,035
- Are you a goalkeeper?
- Yes.

182
00:06:22,036 --> 00:06:23,636
You must be a goalkeeper.

183
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:25,776
That's right.

184
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:27,305
You have to be tall to block the goal.

185
00:06:27,306 --> 00:06:28,505
Let me give you a hint.

186
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:29,575
He's on the national team.

187
00:06:29,576 --> 00:06:30,846
He's number one in the world.

188
00:06:31,616 --> 00:06:32,985
He places first in the world ranking.

189
00:06:32,986 --> 00:06:34,986
You should stay ignorant about it.

190
00:06:35,016 --> 00:06:36,385
Is he really on the national team,

191
00:06:36,386 --> 00:06:37,585
and is he number one in the world?

192
00:06:37,586 --> 00:06:38,825
- Yes.
- Seriously?

193
00:06:38,826 --> 00:06:41,485
- Once you look it up, - He's world-class.

194
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:43,395
- you'll be totally ashamed.
- Really?

195
00:06:43,396 --> 00:06:44,626
Don't look it up.

196
00:06:44,896 --> 00:06:46,025
Once this gets aired,

197
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:47,325
what if people criticize me?

198
00:06:47,326 --> 00:06:48,635
They won't.

199
00:06:48,636 --> 00:06:49,895
Could you please edit it...

200
00:06:49,896 --> 00:06:51,435
I'm sorry. I'll apologize in advance.

201
00:06:51,436 --> 00:06:52,765
- Not knowing is understandable.
- I'm sorry.

202
00:06:52,766 --> 00:06:55,266
I'd like to apologize in advance.

203
00:06:55,806 --> 00:06:57,576
What about you, Sang Uk?

204
00:06:57,736 --> 00:07:00,422
- Your name is Sang Uk, isn't it?
- Yes, it's spelled with letter K.

205
00:07:00,446 --> 00:07:01,975
It's K, not Ke.

206
00:07:01,976 --> 00:07:04,115
(Sang Uk, not Sang Uke)

207
00:07:04,116 --> 00:07:05,175
"Sang Uke?"

208
00:07:05,176 --> 00:07:06,445
It can't be spelled with "uke."

209
00:07:06,446 --> 00:07:08,286
He thinks that I'm a fool.

210
00:07:08,616 --> 00:07:10,385
When you pronounced my name,

211
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:12,486
I heard a nasal sound.

212
00:07:13,256 --> 00:07:14,625
- Sang Uke?
- Sang Uke.

213
00:07:14,626 --> 00:07:15,655
(Flustered)

214
00:07:15,656 --> 00:07:16,955
I will find out...

215
00:07:16,956 --> 00:07:18,926
his occupation later.

216
00:07:18,966 --> 00:07:20,625
Last time, with Sang Uk...

217
00:07:20,626 --> 00:07:22,496
- at the tripe restaurant...
- He's Seung Ho.

218
00:07:23,236 --> 00:07:24,395
It's all right.

219
00:07:24,396 --> 00:07:25,605
(Surpassed)

220
00:07:25,606 --> 00:07:26,736
It's all right.

221
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:27,936
It's the same for Seung Ho.

222
00:07:28,536 --> 00:07:29,775
I found out...

223
00:07:29,776 --> 00:07:31,735
Seung Ho's name at the tripe restaurant.

224
00:07:31,736 --> 00:07:33,722
- I'll figure it out today.
- I can understand him.

225
00:07:33,746 --> 00:07:35,975
(Please memorize our names too.)

226
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:37,475
Today will be...

227
00:07:37,476 --> 00:07:39,416
Daniel's revenge.

228
00:07:39,846 --> 00:07:41,985
It's where his revenge will take place.

229
00:07:41,986 --> 00:07:43,055
Who will recommend lunch...

230
00:07:43,056 --> 00:07:44,755
at Daehak-ro?

231
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:45,756
I will.

232
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:47,125
I didn't know anything about Daehak-ro,

233
00:07:47,126 --> 00:07:48,796
so I did a lot of research.

234
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:52,296
I looked up what's good in this neighborhood.

235
00:07:52,396 --> 00:07:54,265
There's a popular cheonggukjang restaurant.

236
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:55,365
I know that restaurant.

237
00:07:55,366 --> 00:07:57,336
It's a place where many actors go.

238
00:07:57,696 --> 00:07:58,735
It's a restaurant with a Korean set menu.

239
00:07:58,736 --> 00:08:00,765
It's a cheonggukjang restaurant that's been here for a long time.

240
00:08:00,766 --> 00:08:01,965
It's a Korean set menu restaurant?

241
00:08:01,966 --> 00:08:04,235
(A spoonful of memories that are simmered)

242
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:07,105
(LMR 1, cheonggukjang)

243
00:08:07,106 --> 00:08:08,876
The other one is...

244
00:08:09,146 --> 00:08:10,716
visited by many zoomers.

245
00:08:10,816 --> 00:08:12,445
- It's Korean fusion food.
- Korean fusion food?

246
00:08:12,446 --> 00:08:14,116
- Korean fusion food?
- Korean food?

247
00:08:14,886 --> 00:08:16,255
Korean fusion food?

248
00:08:16,256 --> 00:08:17,555
(Made with care)

249
00:08:17,556 --> 00:08:20,925
(Plated as fancy dishes)

250
00:08:20,926 --> 00:08:23,995
(LMR 2, Korean fusion food)

251
00:08:23,996 --> 00:08:25,795
(Between cheonggukjang and Korean fusion food, )

252
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:27,566
(what will be Handsome Guys' choice?)

253
00:08:27,796 --> 00:08:29,335
Daniel, which restaurant will you pick?

254
00:08:29,336 --> 00:08:30,965
Once you tell me, I'll make my decision.

255
00:08:30,966 --> 00:08:32,735
Do you want cheonggukjang or Korean fusion food?

256
00:08:32,736 --> 00:08:34,935
Me? I mean...

257
00:08:34,936 --> 00:08:36,375
Why are you asking me?

258
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:38,005
- You should tell us first.
- Tae Hyun.

259
00:08:38,006 --> 00:08:39,805
Yi Kyung. Why are you asking me?

260
00:08:39,806 --> 00:08:40,845
I'm not going to pay.

261
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:43,045
- I heard you.
- They're just asking you.

262
00:08:43,046 --> 00:08:45,486
- Are they just asking me?
- Yes, what would you like to eat?

263
00:08:46,386 --> 00:08:47,586
For me,

264
00:08:48,046 --> 00:08:49,555
I'll pick Korean fusion food.

265
00:08:49,556 --> 00:08:50,915
- I'll get Korean fusion food.
- Me too.

266
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,725
I'll also pick Korean fusion food.

267
00:08:52,726 --> 00:08:54,225
Please call the cheonggukjang restaurant...

268
00:08:54,226 --> 00:08:55,955
and tell them that we won't be coming.

269
00:08:55,956 --> 00:08:57,355
(A surprising situation created by Daniel)

270
00:08:57,356 --> 00:08:58,995
Today's lunch will be...

271
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:00,466
Daniel's treat.

272
00:09:01,426 --> 00:09:03,265
Shall we go to the Korean fusion food restaurant?

273
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:05,335
(So that was their plan.)

274
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:06,735
How about this?

275
00:09:06,736 --> 00:09:08,165
Before we decide,

276
00:09:08,166 --> 00:09:10,275
let's hear the majority's opinion.

277
00:09:10,276 --> 00:09:12,205
Go ahead and change your choice to cheonggukjang.

278
00:09:12,206 --> 00:09:13,346
- Me?
- Yes.

279
00:09:13,406 --> 00:09:14,575
(Ominous)

280
00:09:14,576 --> 00:09:16,045
I'll pick cheonggukjang.

281
00:09:16,046 --> 00:09:18,045
- Me too.
- I pick cheonggukjang.

282
00:09:18,046 --> 00:09:19,286
(Everyone picks cheonggukjang.)

283
00:09:19,316 --> 00:09:20,685
(Completely surpassed)

284
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,156
That's the gist of it.

285
00:09:22,556 --> 00:09:24,055
This will never work.

286
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:25,625
- Pick what you really want.
- He should choose at the end.

287
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:26,855
- All right.
- Daniel will be the last to pick.

288
00:09:26,856 --> 00:09:27,955
- I'll choose first.
- Okay.

289
00:09:27,956 --> 00:09:29,355
Daniel will be the last to choose.

290
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:31,096
I pick cheonggukjang.

291
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:32,395
Cheonggukjang?

292
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:34,095
I also pick cheonggukjang.

293
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:35,125
I know how it tastes,

294
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:36,596
but I need to go there right now.

295
00:09:36,636 --> 00:09:37,916
I need a boost of cheonggukjang.

296
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:40,805
- What about you, Sang Uk?
- Sang Uk?

297
00:09:40,806 --> 00:09:42,876
I pick Korean fusion food.

298
00:09:42,906 --> 00:09:44,875
- Sang Uk picked Korean fusion food.
- Right.

299
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:45,975
Seung Ho and I picked cheonggukjang.

300
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:47,046
What about you?

301
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:48,506
Korean fusion food.

302
00:09:48,507 --> 00:09:49,775
- This isn't good.
- Why not?

303
00:09:49,776 --> 00:09:50,776
It's 2 against 2.

304
00:09:50,777 --> 00:09:52,316
Then I'll get cheonggukjang.

305
00:09:52,386 --> 00:09:53,685
- Cheonggukjang?
- Yes.

306
00:09:53,686 --> 00:09:55,115

- In Daehak-ro,

we'll go to the Korean fusion restaurant first.

00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:07,925
- Okay.
- This is better.

- I won't yield.

00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:40,826
(The place that made Seung Ho furious)

361
00:11:40,926 --> 00:11:42,446
(Daehak-ro Menu Recommendation, Act 1)

362
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:46,066
(LMR 1, Korean fusion food)

363
00:11:46,866 --> 00:11:48,595
(You can find it on Daehak-ro.)

364
00:11:48,596 --> 00:11:50,796
(A modern hanok restaurant)

365
00:11:51,296 --> 00:11:53,506
(Offering a menu of youthful flavors)

366
00:11:56,576 --> 00:11:59,576
(A place that's buzzing with people)

367
00:12:01,006 --> 00:12:03,376
(LMR 1, Korean fusion food)

368
00:12:03,846 --> 00:12:05,685
Instead of calling it "Korean fusion food,"

369
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:07,645
you should've called it "fancy Korean food."

370
00:12:07,646 --> 00:12:10,385
- Exactly.
- Seung Ho is angry from the start.

371
00:12:10,386 --> 00:12:12,926
Seung Ho is furious right now.

372
00:12:13,226 --> 00:12:15,025
- Hello.
- Hello.

373
00:12:15,026 --> 00:12:16,695
- Are you the restaurant owner?
- Yes.

374
00:12:16,696 --> 00:12:18,025
- Hello.
- How are you so young?

375
00:12:18,026 --> 00:12:19,165
(How are you so young?)

376
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,825
Isn't she an actress?

377
00:12:20,826 --> 00:12:22,095
Right, she is...

378
00:12:22,096 --> 00:12:24,295
Were you also a stage actress?

379
00:12:24,296 --> 00:12:25,296
Seriously?

380
00:12:25,636 --> 00:12:27,105
- I was in musicals.
- Right?

381
00:12:27,106 --> 00:12:28,305
- Right?
- She also did theater work.

382
00:12:28,306 --> 00:12:29,536
Are you an actress?

383
00:12:30,076 --> 00:12:31,576
It's because her teeth don't...

384
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:33,006
look real.

385
00:12:33,246 --> 00:12:35,045
- Are your teeth fake?
- Are they actress teeth?

386
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,615
They could be her real teeth.

387
00:12:36,616 --> 00:12:37,975
You can tell that her teeth were repaired.

388
00:12:37,976 --> 00:12:39,745
No, you misunderstood.

389
00:12:39,746 --> 00:12:41,416
She gave you a sharp look.

390
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:43,916
- We have the same teeth.
- Mine are fake too.

391
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:45,855
But they don't look fake at all.

392
00:12:45,856 --> 00:12:47,525
Thank you. It's not obvious, is it?

393
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:48,585
- It's not.
- Her energy is...

394
00:12:48,586 --> 00:12:50,455
On the menu,

395
00:12:50,456 --> 00:12:53,225
what's your signature dish?

396
00:12:53,226 --> 00:12:56,135
Our signature dish is soft tofu with pollack roe and cheese.

397
00:12:56,136 --> 00:12:57,795
- With pollack roe and cheese?
- That's a popular dish.

398
00:12:57,796 --> 00:12:59,035
So you strongly recommend this?

399
00:12:59,036 --> 00:13:01,305
Perilla oil noodles with beef brisket and jumbo beef ribs.

400
00:13:01,306 --> 00:13:03,975
Is sweet and sour eggplant with chicken good?

401
00:13:03,976 --> 00:13:05,475
- It's very good.
- It's with rice cakes.

402
00:13:05,476 --> 00:13:06,845
- Is it rice cakes?
- It has rice cakes.

403
00:13:06,846 --> 00:13:08,476
No, thank you. I don't like rice cakes.

404
00:13:08,776 --> 00:13:10,515
(He confesses his preference all of a sudden.)

405
00:13:10,516 --> 00:13:11,915
I thought that it was dakgangjeong.

406
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,585
When I eat tteokbokki,

407
00:13:13,586 --> 00:13:14,816
I normally eat the sauce only.

408
00:13:15,316 --> 00:13:17,555
- Only fishcakes and the sauce.
- Me too.

409
00:13:17,556 --> 00:13:18,556
- Really?
- Yes.

410
00:13:18,557 --> 00:13:20,325
Then why did you create this dish with rice cakes?

411
00:13:20,326 --> 00:13:22,656
I don't like rice cakes, but the customers do.

412
00:13:22,796 --> 00:13:28,025
- Are you interested in her?
- I know.

413
00:13:28,026 --> 00:13:29,735
(Suddenly, an emotion unfolds.)

414
00:13:29,736 --> 00:13:31,866
- She doesn't like...
- Daniel is a good man.

415
00:13:31,996 --> 00:13:33,405
She doesn't like rice cakes.

416
00:13:33,406 --> 00:13:35,905
Ma'am, are you married?

417
00:13:35,906 --> 00:13:36,906
Yes.

418
00:13:38,706 --> 00:13:40,505
- Congratulations.
- I'm honored.

419
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:42,586
- Enjoy your food.
- I hope you live long and happy.

420
00:13:42,646 --> 00:13:43,916
"Live long?"

421
00:13:44,146 --> 00:13:47,045
We'll get jumbo beef ribs, soft tofu,

422
00:13:47,046 --> 00:13:48,945
noodles, and cold udon with wide noodles.

423
00:13:48,946 --> 00:13:50,755
- One sweet and sour rice cakes.
- Sweet and sour rice cakes.

424
00:13:50,756 --> 00:13:52,315
- Thank you.
- We'll order those.

425
00:13:52,316 --> 00:13:54,185
Personally,

426
00:13:54,186 --> 00:13:56,095
I love this type of restaurant.

427
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:59,295
Tae Hyun likes to taste new dishes out of curiosity.

428
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,296
I'm very curious.

429
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,466
Isn't it new because it's fusion food?

430
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:04,736
I can't wait to find out how it's served.

431
00:14:06,036 --> 00:14:07,805
(As soon as the order comes in, )

432
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:10,636
(cooking starts.)

433
00:14:15,206 --> 00:14:18,346
(With high anticipation over how the dishes look)

434
00:14:19,946 --> 00:14:22,285
(Side dishes are served first.)

435
00:14:22,286 --> 00:14:23,986
Food is served with pickled cucumber.

436
00:14:24,616 --> 00:14:26,485
- Is it pickled cucumber?
- It's served with pickled cucumber.

437
00:14:26,486 --> 00:14:27,886
She really served pickled cucumber.

438
00:14:28,026 --> 00:14:29,655
(After the side dishes are served)

439
00:14:29,656 --> 00:14:30,796
How is it? Is it good?

440
00:14:33,426 --> 00:14:34,726
It's slightly...

441
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:36,336
It tastes sweet and sour at the end.

442
00:14:38,066 --> 00:14:39,165
Thank you, Seung Ho.

443
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,105
- Let's put this underneath.
- Okay.

444
00:14:41,106 --> 00:14:42,736
Shall we try some pickled cucumber?

445
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:44,276
Go ahead and try it.

446
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:47,406
(Glancing)

447
00:14:48,506 --> 00:14:49,976
(Going right in)

448
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:53,215
(He caught him.)

449
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:55,016
- It's delicious.
- Why did you eat?

450
00:14:55,546 --> 00:14:57,786
- I'm chewing on my tongue.
- Stop.

451
00:14:58,086 --> 00:14:59,725
Hey, Seung Ho.

452
00:14:59,726 --> 00:15:01,486
(Going right in)

453
00:15:01,586 --> 00:15:02,726
Thank you.

454
00:15:03,126 --> 00:15:04,356
Thank you. It's tasty.

455
00:15:05,226 --> 00:15:06,926
- I like it.
- What? It's delicious.

456
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:08,725
This is good.

457
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:10,635
(Confiscating it because it's good)

458
00:15:10,636 --> 00:15:11,735
It's good.

459
00:15:11,736 --> 00:15:13,166
(Disappointed)

460
00:15:13,606 --> 00:15:15,406
- The food is here.
- Your order is here.

461
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:18,205
(Your order is here.)

462
00:15:18,206 --> 00:15:19,376
This is perilla oil noodles.

463
00:15:20,476 --> 00:15:21,605
It looks delicious.

464
00:15:21,606 --> 00:15:24,575
(The meeting of savory grilled beef brisket...)

465
00:15:24,576 --> 00:15:26,586
(and savory perilla oil)

466
00:15:28,286 --> 00:15:30,915
(Savory perilla oil noodles with beef brisket)

467
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:32,316
This is soft tofu with pollack roe.

468
00:15:33,626 --> 00:15:35,255
- I will turn on the heat.
- Okay.

469
00:15:35,256 --> 00:15:36,325
(Soft tofu with pollack roe, cheese with a spoonful of Korean flavor)

470
00:15:36,326 --> 00:15:37,725
- This looks amazing.
- Is this how it's served?

471
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:38,995
This is incredible.

472
00:15:38,996 --> 00:15:40,295
Stir it with your spoon.

473
00:15:40,296 --> 00:15:42,795
It tastes better when the cheese and pollack roe are mixed.

474
00:15:42,796 --> 00:15:43,865
(Impressed)

475
00:15:43,866 --> 00:15:45,395
- It's going to kill me.
- Enjoy your food.

476
00:15:45,396 --> 00:15:47,206
- Thank you.
- This is insane.

477
00:15:48,066 --> 00:15:49,066
(Snapping)

478
00:15:49,236 --> 00:15:51,306
(In awe)

479
00:15:53,346 --> 00:15:54,405
(Getting ready to eat right after taking a photo)

480
00:15:54,406 --> 00:15:55,506
It looks nice.

481
00:15:57,276 --> 00:15:58,846
Tae Hyun, did you already mix them?

482
00:16:00,446 --> 00:16:01,645
I wanted to take a photo.

483
00:16:01,646 --> 00:16:03,316
Why haven't you taken one yet?

484
00:16:03,456 --> 00:16:05,555
You're so high maintenance. You should've taken one quickly.

485
00:16:05,556 --> 00:16:06,956
I'll take a photo of this at least.

486
00:16:07,186 --> 00:16:09,506
Sang Uk already took a photo of it. He can send it to you.

487
00:16:10,126 --> 00:16:11,855
I have my method of taking photos.

488
00:16:11,856 --> 00:16:14,056
- It looks delicious in your photo.
- Here's what I do.

489
00:16:14,296 --> 00:16:15,935
I zoom in completely.

490
00:16:15,936 --> 00:16:17,095
The image fills the frame.

491
00:16:17,096 --> 00:16:18,295
It doesn't fill the frame completely.

492
00:16:18,296 --> 00:16:20,105
Try to fill the frame even more.

493
00:16:20,106 --> 00:16:21,305
- Got it.
- Completely.

494
00:16:21,306 --> 00:16:22,366
Got it.

495
00:16:22,536 --> 00:16:23,776
- Zoom in more.
- "Got it."

496
00:16:24,076 --> 00:16:25,435
- But this is...
- Just like that.

497
00:16:25,436 --> 00:16:27,145
Hey.

498
00:16:27,146 --> 00:16:28,976
- That's pollack roe.
- What's this?

499
00:16:29,616 --> 00:16:31,576
Hey, what kind of photo is this?

500
00:16:31,676 --> 00:16:33,015
My goodness. Is it flying fish roe?

501
00:16:33,016 --> 00:16:35,346
Isn't it obviously soft tofu with pollack roe?

502
00:16:35,616 --> 00:16:37,356
What do you want to start with?

503
00:16:37,656 --> 00:16:39,325
I'd like to try this first.

504
00:16:39,326 --> 00:16:41,285
- Tae Hyun, start with this.
- This?

505
00:16:41,286 --> 00:16:43,166
- You should start with cold food.
- All right.

506
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:45,895
This is perilla oil noodles with beef brisket.

507
00:16:45,896 --> 00:16:48,926
(A hearty mouthful with a slice of beef brisket)

508
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,796
Thank you for the food.

509
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:56,636
It's impossible not to taste good.

510
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:00,076
It looks so delicious.

511
00:17:01,776 --> 00:17:04,646
(Sang Uk also takes a big bite.)

512
00:17:10,686 --> 00:17:12,086
(Smacking his lips)

513
00:17:13,226 --> 00:17:15,586
(Moaning)

514
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,826
This is so difficult.

515
00:17:19,226 --> 00:17:20,296
By the way, that's...

516
00:17:21,226 --> 00:17:22,426
This is...

517
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:24,166
Hey.

518
00:17:26,566 --> 00:17:27,966
(Slurping)

519
00:17:28,536 --> 00:17:30,435
(Provoking Sleeping Rascal Seung Ho)

520
00:17:30,436 --> 00:17:32,205
- Seung Ho will spit on it.
- Smell it.

521
00:17:32,206 --> 00:17:33,446
I'm going to spit on it.

522
00:17:33,476 --> 00:17:35,476
I resisted because he came back after a long time.

523
00:17:36,346 --> 00:17:37,415
You resisted.

524
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:38,856
Usually, I would've done it already.

525
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:43,656
- It looks so good.
- Tae Hyun.

526
00:17:44,886 --> 00:17:46,186
Please let us have some.

527
00:17:46,786 --> 00:17:48,725
He learned very well from Dong Hyun.

528
00:17:48,726 --> 00:17:51,425
Can we do something to win a bite?

529
00:17:51,426 --> 00:17:52,495
(He properly learned how to tease others.)

530
00:17:52,496 --> 00:17:53,666
He learned properly.

531
00:17:53,926 --> 00:17:56,695
How about ordering one more and proceeding quickly?

532
00:17:56,696 --> 00:17:58,236
Let us eat first.

533
00:17:58,696 --> 00:18:01,265
What's that taste called when you eat buckwheat noodles?

534
00:18:01,266 --> 00:18:04,006
- The heavy aftertaste?
- Yes, this isn't heavy at all.

535
00:18:04,176 --> 00:18:06,245
The balance of ingredients is just perfect.

536
00:18:06,246 --> 00:18:07,506
Yes, it's incredible.

537
00:18:07,606 --> 00:18:09,205
Ma'am, what are these seeds?

538
00:18:09,206 --> 00:18:10,715
Are they perilla seeds?

539
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:12,145
- Yes, they're whole perilla seeds.
- Whole perilla seeds?

540
00:18:12,146 --> 00:18:13,885
- Whole perilla seeds.
- The perilla seeds are...

541
00:18:13,886 --> 00:18:15,315
crunchy when you chew them.

542
00:18:15,316 --> 00:18:16,455
Seung Ho, it tastes excellent.

543
00:18:16,456 --> 00:18:19,155
The perilla seeds with the texture are the highlight.

544
00:18:19,156 --> 00:18:21,485
- I totally agree with you.
- It's no joke.

545
00:18:21,486 --> 00:18:23,826
The perilla seeds are crunchy on the palate.

546
00:18:23,996 --> 00:18:25,795
Do you know the ice cream called Shooting Star?

547
00:18:25,796 --> 00:18:27,272
(Do you know the ice cream called Shooting Star?)

548
00:18:27,296 --> 00:18:28,995
It has popping candy inside.

549
00:18:28,996 --> 00:18:29,996
(Popping whole perilla seeds between soft noodles)

550
00:18:29,997 --> 00:18:32,905
This is so fascinating and fun.

551
00:18:32,906 --> 00:18:34,036
(Tae Hyun loves it.)

552
00:18:34,466 --> 00:18:35,766
It's gone.

553
00:18:36,706 --> 00:18:37,836
It's gone.

554
00:18:37,936 --> 00:18:39,945
It disappeared instantly.

555
00:18:39,946 --> 00:18:42,445
They haven't even touched the soft tofu with pollack roe.

556
00:18:42,446 --> 00:18:44,915
- By the way...
- You should stir it once.

557
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,016
Shall I stir it?

558
00:18:52,386 --> 00:18:53,455
(Stretching)

559
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:54,486
Is it cheese?

560
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:56,396
- It's cheese.
- So it's cheese.

561
00:18:56,496 --> 00:18:58,336
This is soft tofu with pollack roe and cheese.

562
00:18:58,756 --> 00:19:00,396
That looks so good.

563
00:19:00,496 --> 00:19:01,596
Doesn't it look tasty?

564
00:19:01,896 --> 00:19:04,496
(The eldest brother is served first.)

565
00:19:05,136 --> 00:19:07,335
(Next is the guest.)

566
00:19:07,336 --> 00:19:08,365
- Is it for me?
- Yes.

567
00:19:08,366 --> 00:19:09,476
Thank you.

568
00:19:10,376 --> 00:19:12,505
- I'll serve you.
- It smells like ramyeon.

569
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:14,706
- Are you Seung Ho or Sang Uk?
- No, I'm Sang Uk.

570
00:19:15,046 --> 00:19:16,175
With letter K.

571
00:19:16,176 --> 00:19:17,876
It's not me who's strange.

572
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:19,916
(Seung Ho)

573
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:22,477
- It's not spelled with "ke." - Sometimes, we become each other.

574
00:19:22,956 --> 00:19:24,855
- Seung Ho.
- Yes?

575
00:19:24,856 --> 00:19:27,186
Do you wear a sports uniform?

576
00:19:27,586 --> 00:19:28,625
Is there a uniform?

577
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:31,455
- My name is Sang Uk.
- Seung... Yes, Sang Uk.

578
00:19:31,456 --> 00:19:32,995
Start playing Twenty Questions.

579
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:34,965
- One for every five.
- Okay.

580
00:19:34,966 --> 00:19:37,395
Guess what kind of sport Sang Uk plays.

581
00:19:37,396 --> 00:19:38,495
Was that your first question?

582
00:19:38,496 --> 00:19:40,706
- Do you have a sports uniform?
- Yes, I do.

583
00:19:41,006 --> 00:19:43,135
Most sports have a uniform.

584
00:19:43,136 --> 00:19:44,275
Dong Hyun also has a uniform.

585
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:45,335
That's true.

586
00:19:45,336 --> 00:19:46,745
- A pair of shorts.
- Is that also a uniform?

587
00:19:46,746 --> 00:19:48,405
There's a uniform for every sport.

588
00:19:48,406 --> 00:19:49,675
Let me ask you another question.

589
00:19:49,676 --> 00:19:51,036
Do you use some kind of equipment?

590
00:19:51,716 --> 00:19:53,085
- Do you mean gears?
- Yes.

591
00:19:53,086 --> 00:19:54,515
We use equipment.

592
00:19:54,516 --> 00:19:55,916
- You do?
- We do.

593
00:19:56,216 --> 00:19:58,015
I didn't say ball game. I asked you about equipment.

594
00:19:58,016 --> 00:19:59,755
You didn't mean ball game, did you?

595
00:19:59,756 --> 00:20:01,755
No, we use equipment.

596
00:20:01,756 --> 00:20:02,796
So it can't be a ball.

597
00:20:04,456 --> 00:20:05,625
We don't know that.

598
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:07,396
He doesn't look like a baseball player.

599
00:20:07,596 --> 00:20:08,695
- No?
- No.

600
00:20:08,696 --> 00:20:09,696
What if it's baseball?

601
00:20:09,697 --> 00:20:10,865
He doesn't look like a baseball player.

602
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:12,095
I have the same last name as Ohtani.

603
00:20:12,096 --> 00:20:13,935
It must be an outdoor sport.

604
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:15,106
(Fencing is an indoor sport.)

605
00:20:15,406 --> 00:20:16,936
You look tanned.

606
00:20:17,406 --> 00:20:19,336
- Stop there and try it.
- Okay.

607
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,675
- I asked three questions so far.
- Try it.

608
00:20:21,676 --> 00:20:22,705
(You won't get it right anyway, so just eat.)

609
00:20:22,706 --> 00:20:23,815
Is it spicy? I can't eat spicy food.

610
00:20:23,816 --> 00:20:24,876
- No.
- It's not spicy.

611
00:20:25,276 --> 00:20:29,315
- Many of us can't eat spicy food.
- It tastes like soft tofu,

612
00:20:29,316 --> 00:20:30,656
but with the cheese...

613
00:20:30,816 --> 00:20:32,486
The cheese made it thicker.

614
00:20:32,716 --> 00:20:34,125
Is it the pollack roe?

615
00:20:34,126 --> 00:20:36,407
Whenever a dish is served, the food disappears instantly.

616
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:38,326
This is...

617
00:20:38,327 --> 00:20:39,995
(He turns around to explain.)

618
00:20:39,996 --> 00:20:41,926
I'm so glad that I came here today.

619
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,365
I like greasy food such as hamburger and pizza.

620
00:20:45,366 --> 00:20:46,835
- I don't like spicy food.
- So this is perfect.

621
00:20:46,836 --> 00:20:48,165
- And this is fusion food.
- Right.

622
00:20:48,166 --> 00:20:50,535
Is it closer to being fusion food than regular soft tofu?

623
00:20:50,536 --> 00:20:52,005
- It's completely different.
- How is it different?

624
00:20:52,006 --> 00:20:53,575
- Because of the cheese?
- Because of the cheese,

625
00:20:53,576 --> 00:20:55,406
it has a strong flavor of cheese.

626
00:20:55,846 --> 00:20:57,545
Here's my personal opinion.

627
00:20:57,546 --> 00:20:59,545
It's like rose of soft tofu.

628
00:20:59,546 --> 00:21:01,846
- That's true.
- I can see the similarity.

629
00:21:03,216 --> 00:21:04,585
Whenever I'm at a restaurant,

630
00:21:04,586 --> 00:21:06,525
and the first dish is delicious,

631
00:21:06,526 --> 00:21:09,055
- I want others to taste it.
- Right? You order more immediately.

632
00:21:09,056 --> 00:21:11,296
So I give them a quiz right away.

633
00:21:11,556 --> 00:21:14,396
Are you willing to give us a bite?

634
00:21:14,626 --> 00:21:15,695
Here's what I think.

635
00:21:15,696 --> 00:21:19,705
You should order one more perilla oil noodles right now.

636
00:21:19,706 --> 00:21:21,166
More food is coming.

637
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:22,666
Here's your next dish.

638
00:21:23,506 --> 00:21:24,905
Okay, now that it's here...

639
00:21:24,906 --> 00:21:26,905
- Let us try this first.
- Go ahead and eat that too.

640
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:28,875
- It's sweet and sour eggplant.
- That's all we ordered.

641
00:21:28,876 --> 00:21:29,946
You ordered so much food.

642
00:21:30,046 --> 00:21:31,745
This is jumbo beef ribs.

643
00:21:31,746 --> 00:21:33,706
I'm glad that we ordered sweet and sour eggplant.

644
00:21:33,786 --> 00:21:35,485
- What's this?
- It's cold udon with flat noodles.

645
00:21:35,486 --> 00:21:36,916
- Flat udon noodles.
- What?

646
00:21:37,356 --> 00:21:39,726
I didn't expect it to look like this.

647
00:21:40,426 --> 00:21:43,425
Wasabi, ground radish, spring onion, and dried laver flakes.

648
00:21:43,426 --> 00:21:46,726
Mix them in the Tsuyu sauce to enjoy.

649
00:21:46,996 --> 00:21:48,796
I've never seen it before.

650
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:51,535
Could we get one more order...

651
00:21:51,536 --> 00:21:52,965
- Okay.
- of perilla oil noodles?

652
00:21:52,966 --> 00:21:54,005
- These are very good.
- I'll bring them soon.

653
00:21:54,006 --> 00:21:55,036
Thank you.

654
00:21:55,366 --> 00:21:56,676
I'm curious about that too.

655
00:21:57,276 --> 00:21:59,305
- What are those flat noodles?
- Try this first.

656
00:21:59,306 --> 00:22:00,375
Should I try this first?

657
00:22:00,376 --> 00:22:02,305
- This?
- Add this first.

658
00:22:02,306 --> 00:22:03,345
(Starting again with cold food this time)

659
00:22:03,346 --> 00:22:04,915
It's good to add some dried laver flakes.

660
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:06,996
(After making the Tsuyu sauce as the chef explained)

661
00:22:07,046 --> 00:22:08,186
Try that first.

662
00:22:08,486 --> 00:22:09,486
Do you know this dish?

663
00:22:09,487 --> 00:22:10,585
- You found it in Japan?
- Yes.

664
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:12,716
- I've never had it before.
- It's common in Japan.

665
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:16,295
It's nice to dip it lightly in the sauce.

666
00:22:16,296 --> 00:22:17,296
(Getting ready to try it by wetting it in the Tsuyu sauce)

667
00:22:17,297 --> 00:22:18,525
I've never seen flat udon noodles.

668
00:22:18,526 --> 00:22:20,166
It's my first time seeing it.

669
00:22:20,596 --> 00:22:22,126
Gosh, it's not going in.

670
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:24,035
Why isn't it coming off?

671
00:22:24,036 --> 00:22:25,535
Why isn't the noodle coming off?

672
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,135
- Tae Hyun.
- It keeps...

673
00:22:27,136 --> 00:22:28,435
Are you teasing us?

674
00:22:28,436 --> 00:22:29,465
(Laughing)

675
00:22:29,466 --> 00:22:30,605
What is it doing?

676
00:22:30,606 --> 00:22:31,935
- Let me show you.
- Just eat it.

677
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,905
A missed swing, a missed kick, and a missed bite.

678
00:22:33,906 --> 00:22:34,945
(This time, he doesn't miss it.)

679
00:22:34,946 --> 00:22:36,476
He failed about two times.

680
00:22:38,416 --> 00:22:39,515
This is perfect for Tae Hyun.

681
00:22:39,516 --> 00:22:41,216
He absolutely loves anything new.

682
00:22:41,686 --> 00:22:43,755
I've never seen those noodles before.

683
00:22:43,756 --> 00:22:47,486
They have a very interesting texture.

684
00:22:48,626 --> 00:22:49,726
Have some more.

685
00:22:50,556 --> 00:22:51,995
I should try some more.

686
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,466
Excuse me, ma'am.

687
00:22:54,966 --> 00:22:55,996
Ma'am?

688
00:22:56,126 --> 00:22:57,535
- Did you make these flat noodles?
- Yes?

689
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:59,765
- Oh, my.
- Why are they so flat?

690
00:22:59,766 --> 00:23:00,966
(Clapping out of satisfaction)

691
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:14,115
Perilla oil.

692
00:23:14,116 --> 00:23:15,746
Let me explain how it tastes.

693
00:23:16,456 --> 00:23:18,456
- This is delicious.
- You know cuttlefish, right?

694
00:23:18,556 --> 00:23:20,626
It tastes like a thin slice of raw cuttlefish.

695
00:23:21,226 --> 00:23:22,885
- I like how you described it.
- Since the noodles are...

696
00:23:22,886 --> 00:23:24,696
- It really looks like it.
- thick,

697
00:23:24,796 --> 00:23:27,826
you can taste the sauce more strongly than usual.

698
00:23:28,266 --> 00:23:30,035
Compared to thin noodles.

699
00:23:30,036 --> 00:23:31,036
(Suffering)

700
00:23:31,037 --> 00:23:33,805
It's so delicious that they didn't even touch the meat.

701
00:23:33,806 --> 00:23:34,806
Your hand is shaking.

702
00:23:34,806 --> 00:23:35,806
- Ribs?
- Ribs.

703
00:23:35,807 --> 00:23:36,836
Yes.

704
00:23:37,306 --> 00:23:39,382
- Look at the ribs.
- I like how there's no rice cake.

705
00:23:39,406 --> 00:23:40,475
What's that?

706
00:23:40,476 --> 00:23:41,875
- It looks like sanjuk.
- Eat it as is.

707
00:23:41,876 --> 00:23:43,076
The ribs look good too.

708
00:23:47,786 --> 00:23:49,486
- It's big.
- Gosh.

709
00:23:49,716 --> 00:23:51,015
(Taking a big bite of the jumbo rib)

710
00:23:51,016 --> 00:23:53,726
You can feel the texture and taste the flavor clearly.

711
00:23:54,456 --> 00:23:56,256
It's slightly sweet.

712
00:23:57,056 --> 00:23:59,256
- It fills the mouth.
- It tastes like jumbo beef ribs.

713
00:23:59,526 --> 00:24:01,326
It's slightly sweet.

714
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:04,296
- It fills the mouth.
- It tastes like jumbo beef ribs.

715
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:07,136
(Impressed)

716
00:24:07,206 --> 00:24:08,866
(Exclaiming)

717
00:24:09,006 --> 00:24:10,605
There are big chunks of ingredients.

718
00:24:10,606 --> 00:24:12,275
- I love the big sizes.
- And so...

719
00:24:12,276 --> 00:24:13,276
(Drooping)

720
00:24:13,277 --> 00:24:16,446
You can taste it twice as much.

721
00:24:16,916 --> 00:24:18,615
- On the palate?
- The difference is huge.

722
00:24:18,616 --> 00:24:20,122
It fills the mouth as soon as you eat it.

723
00:24:20,146 --> 00:24:21,446
Hurry and try the eggplant too.

724
00:24:21,646 --> 00:24:23,516
This eggplant is also excellent.

725
00:24:24,016 --> 00:24:25,485
The eggplant is delicious.

726
00:24:25,486 --> 00:24:28,025
The eggplant is crunchy, and it melts in the mouth.

727
00:24:28,026 --> 00:24:29,525
(Rascal Seung Ho's facial expression is disappearing.)

728
00:24:29,526 --> 00:24:31,626
The fried eggplant is so good.

729
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:33,625
The chef told us.

730
00:24:33,626 --> 00:24:35,326
Seung Ho is angry right now.

731
00:24:35,826 --> 00:24:37,935
(Comforting Rascal Seung Ho is urgent.)

732
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:39,296
The food is here.

733
00:24:39,806 --> 00:24:41,665
Where should I put the perilla oil noodles?

734
00:24:41,666 --> 00:24:43,212
- Please leave them here.
- Right here, please.

735
00:24:43,236 --> 00:24:45,335
- The perilla oil noodles are here.
- It's delicious.

736
00:24:45,336 --> 00:24:46,705
Shall we play darts?

737
00:24:46,706 --> 00:24:47,845
- Yes.
- That sounds good.

738
00:24:47,846 --> 00:24:49,716
We have to decide on the rules clearly.

739
00:24:50,246 --> 00:24:51,845
- Leave it like this.
- It's perfect.

740
00:24:51,846 --> 00:24:53,285
- Just 1?
- Just 1.

741
00:24:53,286 --> 00:24:54,315
- Just 1?
- Just 1.

742
00:24:54,316 --> 00:24:55,316
Then one round each?

743
00:24:55,317 --> 00:24:57,486
- Will there be only one winner?
- Yes.

744
00:24:57,616 --> 00:24:59,726
- The one with the highest score.
- Okay.

745
00:25:01,026 --> 00:25:02,355
Can we make the previous player's dart...

746
00:25:02,356 --> 00:25:03,555
fall off?

747
00:25:03,556 --> 00:25:05,696
- Yes.
- It's too far away.

748
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:06,796
Dong Hyun, here's the line.

749
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,125
- The dotted line.
- Okay.

750
00:25:08,126 --> 00:25:09,566
(Player 1, Kim Dong Hyun)

751
00:25:09,896 --> 00:25:11,235
(Throwing)

752
00:25:11,236 --> 00:25:12,756
Dong Hyun, you're practicing too much.

753
00:25:12,796 --> 00:25:13,865
No, it's the magnet.

754
00:25:13,866 --> 00:25:14,935
Seung Ho is sensitive right now.

755
00:25:14,936 --> 00:25:16,166
He has to win.

756
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:17,375
I haven't started yet.

757
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:19,136
All I need is a bite of the makguksu.

758
00:25:19,676 --> 00:25:20,875
You can't step over the line.

759
00:25:20,876 --> 00:25:23,005
(It's a real start.)

760
00:25:23,006 --> 00:25:24,176
- What?
- What's wrong?

761
00:25:25,446 --> 00:25:26,886
Is that allowed?

762
00:25:27,086 --> 00:25:28,545
Are you going to disturb me?

763
00:25:28,546 --> 00:25:30,085
I am not touching you.

764
00:25:30,086 --> 00:25:31,156
I am not touching you.

765
00:25:31,786 --> 00:25:33,386
- What?
- Okay.

766
00:25:34,156 --> 00:25:35,686
- What?
- Okay.

767
00:25:36,526 --> 00:25:38,325
- Leave it.
- Leave it.

768
00:25:38,326 --> 00:25:39,395
Just make it fall off.

769
00:25:39,396 --> 00:25:40,495
Make it fall off.

770
00:25:40,496 --> 00:25:41,625
That won't be easy.

771
00:25:41,626 --> 00:25:42,865
(Dong Hyun, 60 points)

772
00:25:42,866 --> 00:25:43,995
- That won't be easy.
- You're in the safe zone.

773
00:25:43,996 --> 00:25:45,096
Let's see who wins.

774
00:25:45,896 --> 00:25:47,506
Seung Ho, your shoes are too big.

775
00:25:51,806 --> 00:25:53,405
He might throw it at you. Be careful.

776
00:25:53,406 --> 00:25:55,006
(The master of teasing)

777
00:25:56,476 --> 00:25:58,216
(Startled)

778
00:26:00,516 --> 00:26:04,886
(Will Rascal Seung Ho be able to eat some makguksu?)

779
00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:10,189
(Will Rascal Seung Ho be able to eat some makguksu?)

780
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:11,548
Oh, yes.

781
00:26:11,549 --> 00:26:13,889
(What's the result for Rascal Seung Ho?)

782
00:26:14,659 --> 00:26:15,918
(Rascal Seung Ho, 50 points)

783
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:16,989
Fifty points.

784
00:26:17,259 --> 00:26:18,389
Okay.

785
00:26:18,859 --> 00:26:20,128
There's only one winner, right?

786
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:21,198
- Just 1 winner.
- Exactly.

787
00:26:21,199 --> 00:26:22,199
- The 1 with the highest score.
- Only 1 person.

788
00:26:22,199 --> 00:26:23,199
His dart could fall off.

789
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,298
- If it falls off...
- I'll try...

790
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:25,328
to hit Dong Hyun's dart.

791
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:27,238
Yi Kyung, you have to score more than 80.

792
00:26:27,239 --> 00:26:28,639
- At least 80 points.
- Either way,

793
00:26:29,269 --> 00:26:30,768
I'll hit Dong Hyun's.

794
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:33,045
- Stick it on by dunking.
- It should go higher than that.

795
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:35,838
(Getting more violent)

796
00:26:35,839 --> 00:26:37,039
It should go higher than that.

797
00:26:39,709 --> 00:26:42,918
(Yi Kyung, 10 points)

798
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:44,719
I was too focused on going after Dong Hyun's.

799
00:26:44,819 --> 00:26:45,948
(Dong Hyun gets to freeload.)

800
00:26:45,949 --> 00:26:47,258
Okay, he's okay with it.

801
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:48,559
Go ahead and eat.

802
00:26:48,789 --> 00:26:49,888
Just one bite, right?

803
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:52,059
Yes, but he can eat a lot.

804
00:26:52,129 --> 00:26:53,499
Mix them more.

805
00:26:53,629 --> 00:26:54,828
Let him have only one bite.

806
00:26:54,829 --> 00:26:56,198
- You can take one big bite.
- You have to mix them thoroughly.

807
00:26:56,199 --> 00:26:57,229
It's okay.

808
00:26:57,899 --> 00:26:59,899
- It's a new dish.
- Oh, my.

809
00:26:59,999 --> 00:27:01,199
Aren't you taking too much?

810
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:03,098
- We need to play one more game.
- This is like...

811
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:04,308
shadowboxing.

812
00:27:04,309 --> 00:27:06,069
It's shadowboxing before a match.

813
00:27:06,139 --> 00:27:08,109
Dong Hyun, we have to play one more game.

814
00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:09,738
I'm shadowboxing.

815
00:27:09,739 --> 00:27:11,749
This much is perfect.

816
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:13,419
One more.

817
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:15,748
It won't be tasty like that.

818
00:27:15,749 --> 00:27:16,848
You have to mix them thoroughly...

819
00:27:16,849 --> 00:27:17,918
- with the perilla oil.
- See?

820
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:19,249
I've been mixing them.

821
00:27:20,789 --> 00:27:22,989
I saw that you didn't mix them thoroughly.

822
00:27:23,219 --> 00:27:24,388
- You have to mix them more.
- Really?

823
00:27:24,389 --> 00:27:25,828
- Keep going.
- Mix them more like this?

824
00:27:25,829 --> 00:27:27,099
- Mix them more.
- Like this?

825
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:28,529
Is it well mixed now?

826
00:27:28,859 --> 00:27:30,298
- Add some sauce.
- More?

827
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:32,068
- Yes.
- Goodness.

828
00:27:32,069 --> 00:27:33,515
- Do I have to mix them again?
- Yes.

829
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:34,539
Please mix them.

830
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,938
(He's hungry.)

831
00:27:35,939 --> 00:27:37,339
It takes five minutes to mix.

832
00:27:37,439 --> 00:27:40,008
You should've eaten it right away.

833
00:27:40,009 --> 00:27:41,279
You waited too long.

834
00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:42,438
The time is over.

835
00:27:42,439 --> 00:27:44,749
Please let me have one bite.

836
00:27:45,009 --> 00:27:46,209
Just this once.

837
00:27:46,779 --> 00:27:48,378
- Don't blame him.
- If you get greedy,

838
00:27:48,379 --> 00:27:49,619
you'll run out of time.

839
00:27:50,049 --> 00:27:51,619
- Okay, it's perfect.
- Take your bite.

840
00:27:52,489 --> 00:27:53,619
It's well done.

841
00:27:54,789 --> 00:27:56,158
It's impossible to taste bad.

842
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:57,659
- It's really good.
- Yes.

843
00:27:59,729 --> 00:28:00,729
Tae Hyun.

844
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,598
Let me talk while Dong Hyun is chewing.

845
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:03,729
The restaurant owner said...

846
00:28:03,829 --> 00:28:05,898
that we waited too long.

847
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:07,968
Though it was served recently, he said that it's been too long.

848
00:28:07,969 --> 00:28:08,969
It hasn't been long.

849
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:10,968
We'd better play again now. If the sauce is served again...

850
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:12,939
(He wants to play another game for freeloading.)

851
00:28:13,209 --> 00:28:14,838
The sauce will keep coming.

852
00:28:14,839 --> 00:28:15,839
Tae Hyun.

853
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,048
- Shall we start right away?
- Go ahead.

854
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:18,248
- Gosh, this is...
- Start right away.

855
00:28:18,249 --> 00:28:19,278
Isn't it incredible?

856
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,778
I thought that I had enough.

857
00:28:20,779 --> 00:28:22,018
If I win one more time,

858
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:23,319
I'll eat even more.

859
00:28:24,919 --> 00:28:25,919
This is for me.

860
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:27,418
(The taste of makguksu increases the appetite.)

861
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:29,035
- Let's hurry and play, Dong Hyun.
- Okay.

862
00:28:29,059 --> 00:28:30,828
Let's play in the opposite order this time.

863
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:32,728
None of you stand a chance.

864
00:28:32,729 --> 00:28:33,729
Go.

865
00:28:35,459 --> 00:28:36,459
He threw it.

866
00:28:37,069 --> 00:28:38,069
He threw it.

867
00:28:39,329 --> 00:28:40,975
- That's ambiguous.
- He scored 50 points.

868
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:42,169
It's not bad.

869
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:44,169
- What?
- What?

870
00:28:44,309 --> 00:28:47,208
(Seung Ho threw it right after him.)

871
00:28:47,209 --> 00:28:48,838
- Forty points.
- He got eliminated.

872
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:50,109
(40 points)

873
00:28:50,609 --> 00:28:51,979
As long as he doesn't win...

874
00:28:52,409 --> 00:28:54,318
- Gosh.
- Will he be the champion?

875
00:28:54,319 --> 00:28:55,619
Is there something going on?

876
00:28:56,219 --> 00:28:57,489
Is there something going on?

877
00:28:58,289 --> 00:28:59,318
(Yi Kyung, 50 points)

878
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:01,289
Forty points?

879
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,388
Did he tie with me?

880
00:29:03,389 --> 00:29:05,029
I'll take a look.

881
00:29:05,089 --> 00:29:06,089
- It's correct.
- I'll take a look.

882
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:07,959
- Me, Seung Ho, Dong Hyun.
- Yi Kyung.

883
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:10,568
(Which dart is closest to the center?)

884
00:29:10,569 --> 00:29:11,628
- This one.
- Okay.

885
00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:13,168
(Yi Kyung wins.)

886
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:14,968
- Yi Kyung won.
- Eat this no matter what.

887
00:29:14,969 --> 00:29:16,138
I should've taken my time.

888
00:29:16,139 --> 00:29:17,868
(Depressed)

889
00:29:17,869 --> 00:29:19,549
- I should've taken my time.
- By the way,

890
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:21,339
like putting an angry child...

891
00:29:22,079 --> 00:29:23,848
- Right.
- to sleep.

892
00:29:23,849 --> 00:29:24,849
I'd like to eat,

893
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,778
but may I give a bite to Seung Ho?

894
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:27,949
(Yielding to Rascal Seung Ho)

895
00:29:28,249 --> 00:29:30,148
(Gosh, this is infuriating.)

896
00:29:30,149 --> 00:29:32,449
Then you should've let him win.

897
00:29:33,719 --> 00:29:35,258
All right.

898
00:29:35,259 --> 00:29:36,389
Our rascal.

899
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,388
(Leave him alone. He must really want some.)

900
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:41,598
Yi Kyung, you should get a bite and give it to him.

901
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:42,998
- I'll feed it to him.
- Okay.

902
00:29:42,999 --> 00:29:43,999
That sounds good.

903
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,599
Seung Ho will eat, but you have to react to it instead.

904
00:29:46,969 --> 00:29:48,039
What?

905
00:29:48,599 --> 00:29:49,968
- I'll do that too.
- Okay.

906
00:29:49,969 --> 00:29:52,009
- I'll do that too.
- Like lip-synching.

907
00:29:52,369 --> 00:29:54,438
(Rascal Seung Ho became gentle in an instant.)

908
00:29:54,439 --> 00:29:55,838
Our show provides...

909
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:58,679
better solutions than Ms. Oh Eun Yeong.

910
00:29:59,779 --> 00:30:03,688
That's the only way to deal with thugs like him.

911
00:30:03,689 --> 00:30:05,689
- But...
- Quickly.

912
00:30:05,819 --> 00:30:06,959
That's the only way.

913
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:09,159
- That's a lot.
- Quickly.

914
00:30:09,219 --> 00:30:10,889
- Yi Kyung.
- Can he eat all of that?

915
00:30:10,989 --> 00:30:12,528
Eat it like Yi Kyung would.

916
00:30:12,529 --> 00:30:13,998
- Warm up your mouth.
- Consider me eating this.

917
00:30:13,999 --> 00:30:15,498
- Warm up your mouth.
- Think of me eating this.

918
00:30:15,499 --> 00:30:17,068
- My fingers hurt.
- Isn't that too much?

919
00:30:17,069 --> 00:30:21,738
(Sucking in)

920
00:30:21,739 --> 00:30:22,739
Isn't that too much?

921
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:25,138
(Yi Kyung sucks in the noodles as well.)

922
00:30:25,139 --> 00:30:27,079
He has a huge mouth.

923
00:30:28,279 --> 00:30:30,139
- Yi Kyung, how is it?
- This?

924
00:30:30,249 --> 00:30:32,148
Perilla oil, sesame oil, and sesame seeds.

925
00:30:32,149 --> 00:30:33,308
How are the perilla seeds?

926
00:30:33,309 --> 00:30:34,448
Did the perilla seeds pop in your mouth?

927
00:30:34,449 --> 00:30:35,819
Yes, it was a party in my mouth.

928
00:30:36,989 --> 00:30:38,588
I'll now have the white kimchi.

929
00:30:38,589 --> 00:30:39,589
(Exclaiming)

930
00:30:40,189 --> 00:30:41,789
I'll now have the white kimchi.

931
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:43,628
(Premium Bluetooth connectivity)

932
00:30:43,629 --> 00:30:44,958
White kimchi!

933
00:30:44,959 --> 00:30:46,128
It's so refreshing.

934
00:30:46,129 --> 00:30:47,998
- Pickled cucumber.
- I was going to have that.

935
00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:48,999
- The pickled cucumber.
- The pickled cucumber.

936
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,699
Tangy and sour!

937
00:30:51,069 --> 00:30:52,769
- What a combo.
- Nice.

938
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:54,568
What a combo.

939
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:55,998
(The Bluetooth show leaves the audience satisfied.)

940
00:30:55,999 --> 00:30:57,039
Good job.

941
00:30:57,239 --> 00:30:58,739
You can have the rest.

942
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,108
Thank you.

943
00:31:00,109 --> 00:31:01,178
(The solution for Rascal Seung Ho was a huge success.)

944
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:02,339
Can I have the rest?

945
00:31:02,409 --> 00:31:04,049
Look how that calmed Seung Ho down.

946
00:31:05,009 --> 00:31:06,209
I'm a sweet kid.

947
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:08,379
Is that the end of us freeloading?

948
00:31:08,679 --> 00:31:10,648
Is that the end of us freeloading?

949
00:31:10,649 --> 00:31:11,719
How about this?

950
00:31:11,949 --> 00:31:14,159
We'll have the restaurant owner...

951
00:31:14,319 --> 00:31:17,028
choose one of you to freeload.

952
00:31:17,029 --> 00:31:19,258
I happen to study physiognomy.

953
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:21,499
(I happen to study physiognomy.)

954
00:31:21,729 --> 00:31:23,528
Your face tells me...

955
00:31:23,529 --> 00:31:26,528
that you have a bright future in your latter years.

956
00:31:26,529 --> 00:31:28,368
Ma'am, come on over. You need to choose one of them.

957
00:31:28,369 --> 00:31:29,569
Your business will thrive,

958
00:31:29,669 --> 00:31:31,538
and only good things will come...

959
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:33,068
to your family.

960
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:34,208
- Really?
- Also,

961
00:31:34,209 --> 00:31:36,078
I'll keep praying for you.

962
00:31:36,079 --> 00:31:37,079
Ma'am...

963
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,348
(You must want the food badly.)

964
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:41,018
Ma'am...

965
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:42,578
(He's embarrassed for Dong Hyun.)

966
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:43,719
Anyway,

967
00:31:43,849 --> 00:31:45,748
I want the beef. I need my intake of protein.

968
00:31:45,749 --> 00:31:47,635
- Ma'am, please.
- We don't know who she's fond of.

969
00:31:47,659 --> 00:31:50,059
Who do you want to see eating the galbi?

970
00:31:50,189 --> 00:31:51,429
Today, I...

971
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:55,459
What's your name again?

972
00:31:55,929 --> 00:31:58,199
- I'm Oh Sang Uk.
- Hold on a second.

973
00:31:58,269 --> 00:31:59,998
You got angry with me the last time I was here.

974
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:01,168
You can't choose someone if you don't know their name.

975
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:03,168
- He brought his hands together.
- He's allowed to eat.

976
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:04,809
I'm Shin Seung Ho.

977
00:32:05,169 --> 00:32:06,885
- Why don't people know him?
- Then, Shin Seung Ho.

978
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:07,979
- Me?
- Yes.

979
00:32:08,339 --> 00:32:09,678
- Why?
- Did you make up your mind?

980
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:10,748
- Yes.
- Is there a particular reason?

981
00:32:10,749 --> 00:32:14,118
I was impressed by his description of noodles with perilla oil.

982
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,948
- I'm the one who said it.
- He described the taste.

983
00:32:15,949 --> 00:32:17,319
- Really?
- I described the taste.

984
00:32:17,589 --> 00:32:18,688
I'm sorry to say this,

985
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:20,369
but she won't even look in your direction.

986
00:32:20,489 --> 00:32:23,318
- I see.
- She only has eyes for Seung Ho.

987
00:32:23,319 --> 00:32:25,388
- He's Shin Seung Ho.
- Since she has...

988
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:28,258
all the authority, I'll ask this one thing.

989
00:32:28,259 --> 00:32:30,128
Yi Kyung let me have his bite earlier.

990
00:32:30,129 --> 00:32:31,328
- That's right.
- It's okay.

991
00:32:31,329 --> 00:32:33,868
- Can I share this with him?
- Yes, of course.

992
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,669
Why don't you describe how it tastes instead?

993
00:32:35,769 --> 00:32:37,169
Me? Of course.

994
00:32:37,569 --> 00:32:39,138
That's hardly a challenge.

995
00:32:39,139 --> 00:32:40,238
While I was away,

996
00:32:40,239 --> 00:32:41,609
the show developed a bromance.

997
00:32:41,739 --> 00:32:43,879
Is this how it is on the show now?

998
00:32:44,579 --> 00:32:46,208
- Sure thing.
- No, have this.

999
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:48,579
- Go ahead.
- What are you two doing in my face?

1000
00:32:48,749 --> 00:32:49,948
(Annoyed)

1001
00:32:49,949 --> 00:32:52,388
This isn't how it's supposed to be on our show.

1002
00:32:52,389 --> 00:32:53,519
You can have this one.

1003
00:32:54,619 --> 00:32:55,658
What the...

1004
00:32:55,659 --> 00:32:57,088
(Seriously?)

1005
00:32:57,089 --> 00:32:59,129
- That's a bromance.
- What was that?

1006
00:33:00,029 --> 00:33:02,159
Bluetooth connected.

1007
00:33:02,829 --> 00:33:04,729
My left chest.

1008
00:33:05,929 --> 00:33:07,439
Firing off from my fingers.

1009
00:33:07,499 --> 00:33:09,338
(Bluetooth connection error)

1010
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:11,269
- What?
- What was that?

1011
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:12,608
The aroma.

1012
00:33:12,609 --> 00:33:13,879
Meanwhile, I'm a nutjob.

1013
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:17,978
(What was that?)

1014
00:33:17,979 --> 00:33:19,049
Heart.

1015
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:21,278
Firing off.

1016
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:22,378
My lats...

1017
00:33:22,379 --> 00:33:23,418
(He ends it with a clean mention of the lats.)

1018
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:24,489
His lats?

1019
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:25,619
The lats.

1020
00:33:26,619 --> 00:33:28,788
It was a fresh new way...

1021
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:31,259
- of explaining flavors and taste.
- Yes, very fresh.

1022
00:33:31,859 --> 00:33:34,459
- We'll now answer the question.
- I wouldn't mind...

1023
00:33:34,599 --> 00:33:36,758
you getting the question wrong...

1024
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:38,468
and seeing Daniel start off the day...

1025
00:33:38,469 --> 00:33:39,769
paying for the meal.

1026
00:33:40,669 --> 00:33:42,539
- Here's your question.
- Sure.

1027
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:43,969
Here,

1028
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:46,639
they serve Korean fusion cuisine made with seafood.

1029
00:33:46,909 --> 00:33:48,809
The English names of seafood...

1030
00:33:48,979 --> 00:33:50,979
often relate to how they look.

1031
00:33:51,249 --> 00:33:53,649
Meonggae is called a sea pineapple...

1032
00:33:53,819 --> 00:33:55,139
because it resembles a pineapple.

1033
00:33:56,119 --> 00:33:57,888
- A sea pineapple.
- Meanwhile, haesam...

1034
00:33:57,889 --> 00:33:59,218
is called sea "this..."

1035
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:01,089
because of the resemblance.

1036
00:34:01,689 --> 00:34:03,988
- What is this?
- This is an easy one.

1037
00:34:03,989 --> 00:34:05,229
I think I know what it is.

1038
00:34:05,359 --> 00:34:06,958
What does a haesam look like?

1039
00:34:06,959 --> 00:34:08,529
It's black and...

1040
00:34:09,059 --> 00:34:10,229
The English name for haesam.

1041
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:11,999
This is such an easy one.

1042
00:34:12,769 --> 00:34:14,068
- Is it this?
- What?

1043
00:34:14,069 --> 00:34:15,198
Balls.

1044
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,309
(Laughing)

1045
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:19,045
- Do you know what he said?
- What did he say?

1046
00:34:19,069 --> 00:34:20,539
He asked if the answer was balls.

1047
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,208
He must've been thinking about a spoon worm.

1048
00:34:23,209 --> 00:34:24,278
He mixed it up with a spoon worm.

1049
00:34:24,279 --> 00:34:25,678
Try adding "sea" to it.

1050
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:27,519
You said it looks like this.

1051
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,119
A haesam.

1052
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:30,788
What does it even look like?

1053
00:34:30,789 --> 00:34:32,248
I have no idea. I can't remember.

1054
00:34:32,249 --> 00:34:33,518
Can you describe it to me?

1055
00:34:33,519 --> 00:34:34,858
If you do, I might figure it out.

1056
00:34:34,859 --> 00:34:36,019
Why don't I draw it for them?

1057
00:34:36,589 --> 00:34:37,888
Does it have spikes?

1058
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:39,689
- That's a sea urchin.
- Right, a sea urchin.

1059
00:34:40,129 --> 00:34:41,558
From what I recall,

1060
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:42,999
it's black and looks like this.

1061
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,729
Dong Hyun's drawing is right on the nose.

1062
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:48,569
- This shocked me.
- He's not wrong.

1063
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,908
- Imagine it being alive.
- This is what it looks like.

1064
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:52,338
Imagine it being alive.

1065
00:34:52,339 --> 00:34:54,309
- You drew a caterpillar.
- This is a haesam.

1066
00:34:54,379 --> 00:34:56,009
- A haesam...
- It looks like this.

1067
00:34:56,209 --> 00:34:57,578
I don't know what it looks like.

1068
00:34:57,579 --> 00:34:59,079
This is a haesam.

1069
00:34:59,709 --> 00:35:01,948
The second I heard the question,

1070
00:35:01,949 --> 00:35:04,188
I immediately thought of "rock."

1071
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:05,288
- Sea rock.
- Sea rock?

1072
00:35:05,289 --> 00:35:06,589
(Sea rock)

1073
00:35:06,889 --> 00:35:08,489
Sea rock...

1074
00:35:08,519 --> 00:35:10,259
- or sea stone.
- Sea stone.

1075
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:12,728
Don't you think it looked like a cockroach?

1076
00:35:12,729 --> 00:35:13,998
His drawing, I mean.

1077
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:15,128
It looks like an insect.

1078
00:35:15,129 --> 00:35:16,759
Yes, like a cockroach.

1079
00:35:17,469 --> 00:35:18,769
Sea cockroach?

1080
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:20,569
Give sea cockroach as your answer.

1081
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,668
It can't be a cockroach.

1082
00:35:22,669 --> 00:35:23,868
(He pretends to look away but looks back.)

1083
00:35:23,869 --> 00:35:25,768
- Sea worm.
- I thought of that too.

1084
00:35:25,769 --> 00:35:27,279
- Sea worm.
- It looks like a worm.

1085
00:35:27,879 --> 00:35:29,978
- It looks like a huge worm.
- Like a silkworm.

1086
00:35:29,979 --> 00:35:31,879
If it's a worm,

1087
00:35:32,149 --> 00:35:33,349
wouldn't the answer...

1088
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:35,918
- be a bug or insect?
- A silkworm.

1089
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:38,189
- I couldn't get it.
- Daniel...

1090
00:35:38,319 --> 00:35:40,759
was getting the answer from the restaurant owner.

1091
00:35:41,189 --> 00:35:42,518
- Come on.
- Do you know...

1092
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:44,159
what I got from her?

1093
00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:45,758
Ssiwoocheombeong.

1094
00:35:45,759 --> 00:35:46,788
(Ssiwoocheombeong?)

1095
00:35:46,789 --> 00:35:48,298
Is there a fruit by that name?

1096
00:35:48,299 --> 00:35:49,758
I saw Daniel's eyes.

1097
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:51,228
Ssiwoocheombeong?

1098
00:35:51,229 --> 00:35:53,168
- She kept giving him the answer, - That's cheating.

1099
00:35:53,169 --> 00:35:54,268
But Daniel was like this.

1100
00:35:54,269 --> 00:35:56,138
(Copying Daniel)

1101
00:35:56,139 --> 00:35:57,369
I couldn't tell what it was.

1102
00:35:58,539 --> 00:36:00,338
- Sea worm.
- How about a worm?

1103
00:36:00,339 --> 00:36:01,379
- Sea worm.
- A worm.

1104
00:36:01,939 --> 00:36:04,078
(Well...)

1105
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,278
Let's go with a fruit.

1106
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:06,978
The example they gave us was a pineapple.

1107
00:36:06,979 --> 00:36:08,418
What fruit...

1108
00:36:08,419 --> 00:36:10,319
has a bumpy surface?

1109
00:36:11,149 --> 00:36:13,019
Tae Hyun, hear me out.

1110
00:36:13,149 --> 00:36:15,088
Meonggae is called a sea pineapple...

1111
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,889
- and it's red.
- Right.

1112
00:36:16,989 --> 00:36:19,529
Do you picture a pineapple when you think of a meonggae?

1113
00:36:19,589 --> 00:36:21,305
- Not really.
- I can't make the connection.

1114
00:36:21,329 --> 00:36:24,068
Judging by the size and shape of it,

1115
00:36:24,069 --> 00:36:25,269
it could be a mango.

1116
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:27,868
- They have the same shape.
- Because...

1117
00:36:27,869 --> 00:36:29,768
- it's flat.
- I get what you mean.

1118
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:31,038
- It looks like a rugby ball.
- Eggplant or mango.

1119
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,268
You're not considering...

1120
00:36:32,269 --> 00:36:33,469
- its bumpy skin.
- No.

1121
00:36:33,669 --> 00:36:35,138
Let's go with mango.

1122
00:36:35,139 --> 00:36:37,208
- Let's go with mango.
- I think that's it.

1123
00:36:37,209 --> 00:36:39,508
If not for the bumpy skin, it looks like a mango.

1124
00:36:39,509 --> 00:36:41,348
I think Seung Ho...

1125
00:36:41,349 --> 00:36:42,518
- I'm Sang Uk.
- Right, you're Sang Uk.

1126
00:36:42,519 --> 00:36:44,019
- Yes, Sang Uk.
- Right.

1127
00:36:44,219 --> 00:36:46,249
Sang Uk convinced me.

1128
00:36:46,489 --> 00:36:48,359
- Let's go with mango.
- Mango?

1129
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:50,088
Go ahead and say it.

1130
00:36:50,089 --> 00:36:51,428
- That could be right.
- I got it.

1131
00:36:51,429 --> 00:36:52,459
Mango.

1132
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:53,758
Mango?

1133
00:36:53,759 --> 00:36:55,998
(Answer: Mango)

1134
00:36:55,999 --> 00:36:57,159
A sea mango.

1135
00:36:58,069 --> 00:36:59,268
Mango.

1136
00:36:59,269 --> 00:37:01,269
If only we knew what it looked like.

1137
00:37:01,669 --> 00:37:02,998
Incorrect.

1138
00:37:02,999 --> 00:37:04,168
What?

1139
00:37:04,169 --> 00:37:06,309
He made it sound like we had gotten it.

1140
00:37:06,669 --> 00:37:08,278
- Go ahead.
- And it's on.

1141
00:37:08,279 --> 00:37:09,359
It's every man for himself.

1142
00:37:09,509 --> 00:37:10,649
- I got it.
- Sure.

1143
00:37:11,949 --> 00:37:13,048
A sea worm.

1144
00:37:13,049 --> 00:37:14,648
- Incorrect.
- Is that not it?

1145
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,849
I got it.

1146
00:37:16,149 --> 00:37:17,249
A sea rock.

1147
00:37:17,889 --> 00:37:19,489
- Incorrect.
- A turtle.

1148
00:37:20,349 --> 00:37:21,359
Incorrect.

1149
00:37:21,459 --> 00:37:23,158
- Is that not it?
- Go ahead.

1150
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:24,858
It's on this table.

1151
00:37:24,859 --> 00:37:26,929
(It's on this table.)

1152
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:28,058
I got it!

1153
00:37:28,059 --> 00:37:29,159
(I got it!)

1154
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:32,268
- It must be eggplant.
- Really?

1155
00:37:32,269 --> 00:37:33,598
- Eggplant.
- Eggplant?

1156
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,538
(Answer: Eggplant)

1157
00:37:35,539 --> 00:37:36,968
- Incorrect.
- What is it?

1158
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:38,468
Mushroom.

1159
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:39,509
- Incorrect.
- Darn.

1160
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:41,078
I got it. Cucumber.

1161
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:42,209
Cucumber?

1162
00:37:42,809 --> 00:37:43,839
Correct.

1163
00:37:44,709 --> 00:37:45,778
- Is that really correct?
- Yes.

1164
00:37:45,779 --> 00:37:46,879
That's the one.

1165
00:37:47,549 --> 00:37:48,719
Right, a cucumber.

1166
00:37:48,919 --> 00:37:49,948
- There's pickled cucumber.
- Cucumber.

1167
00:37:49,949 --> 00:37:51,018
There's pickled cucumber.

1168
00:37:51,019 --> 00:37:52,448
- Cucumber!
- There's pickled cucumber.

1169
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:54,235
(Pickled cucumber was served as a side dish.)

1170
00:37:54,259 --> 00:37:55,758
The owner wasn't saying woodamcheong,

1171
00:37:55,759 --> 00:37:56,958
but cucumber.

1172
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:58,428
She kept saying cucumber.

1173
00:37:58,429 --> 00:38:02,028
- What's a cucumber?
- That's how you say it in English.

1174
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:04,098
Is cucumber the English word?

1175
00:38:04,099 --> 00:38:05,268
Is that what she was saying?

1176
00:38:05,269 --> 00:38:06,998
- Woocheombeong!
- That's what I kept hearing.

1177
00:38:06,999 --> 00:38:08,279
- Woocheombeong.
- Unbelievable.

1178
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:10,068
Cucumber!

1179
00:38:10,069 --> 00:38:11,268
She was trying to give you the answer.

1180
00:38:11,269 --> 00:38:12,438
From over there.

1181
00:38:12,439 --> 00:38:14,208
- Woocheombeong.
- I had no idea.

1182
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,008
We would've gotten it if we had deciphered that.

1183
00:38:16,009 --> 00:38:18,508
He wasn't wrong about it sounding like woocheombeong.

1184
00:38:18,509 --> 00:38:20,408
I learned the English word for cucumber today.

1185
00:38:20,409 --> 00:38:21,779
It's a good thing he didn't know.

1186
00:38:21,919 --> 00:38:23,019
- All right.
- Bring it.

1187
00:38:23,049 --> 00:38:26,219
Here's the question for the two of you.

1188
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:27,618
You will guess the slogan.

1189
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:28,819
- The slogan?
- That's right.

1190
00:38:29,259 --> 00:38:31,589
Unintentional harsh words...

1191
00:38:31,729 --> 00:38:33,489
can cause a relationship to do "this."

1192
00:38:34,559 --> 00:38:35,999
- Is that it?
- Yes.

1193
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:38,528
Unintentional harsh words can cause a relationship to do "this."

1194
00:38:38,529 --> 00:38:39,569
End it.

1195
00:38:40,299 --> 00:38:42,099
- End it?
- A lot comes to mind.

1196
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:45,508
If it's a slogan, shouldn't it rhyme?

1197
00:38:45,509 --> 00:38:47,385
Unintentional harsh words... I'll give you the answer.

1198
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:49,079
Unintentional harsh words...

1199
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:50,639
can 5242 a relationship.

1200
00:38:51,409 --> 00:38:53,008
- Like a cucumber?
- Exactly.

1201
00:38:53,009 --> 00:38:54,348
- Go for is.
- Cucumber?

1202
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:57,019
Some businesses have phone numbers that end with 5242, remember?

1203
00:38:57,249 --> 00:38:59,149
- I got it. 5242.
- Did you say 5242?

1204
00:39:00,019 --> 00:39:01,058
Come on.

1205
00:39:01,059 --> 00:39:02,158
It's a slogan.

1206
00:39:02,159 --> 00:39:03,619
I should get on with it...

1207
00:39:03,889 --> 00:39:06,029
and throw about some answers to stumble upon one.

1208
00:39:06,659 --> 00:39:07,798
- Okay.
- Incorrect.

1209
00:39:07,799 --> 00:39:08,928
It is a four-syllable Korean word.

1210
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:10,098
- Really?
- Four syllables?

1211
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:11,859
I got it. It could roughen our relationship.

1212
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:13,199
Incorrect.

1213
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:14,998
- Roughen?
- It's an onomatopoeia.

1214
00:39:14,999 --> 00:39:16,099
It'll get rougher.

1215
00:39:16,169 --> 00:39:17,668
Isn't it an onomatopoeia...

1216
00:39:17,669 --> 00:39:19,309
formed by repeating a two-syllable word?

1217
00:39:19,339 --> 00:39:20,908
That's right. The two-syllable word is repeated.

1218
00:39:20,909 --> 00:39:21,978
We need to get the two-syllable word.

1219
00:39:21,979 --> 00:39:23,709
You can find it in song lyrics.

1220
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:25,825
G-DRAGON has a song with a name similar to this word.

1221
00:39:25,849 --> 00:39:27,049
"Bang, Bang, Bang."

1222
00:39:29,149 --> 00:39:31,788
Which G-DRAGON song?

1223
00:39:31,789 --> 00:39:33,049
I got it. Crooked.

1224
00:39:33,549 --> 00:39:35,158
- That's not it.
- You're almost there.

1225
00:39:35,159 --> 00:39:36,159
Incorrect.

1226
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,528
- You're almost there.
- You're almost there.

1227
00:39:37,529 --> 00:39:38,828
You're at the finish line.

1228
00:39:38,829 --> 00:39:39,829
Double b.

1229
00:39:40,029 --> 00:39:41,298
(Double b)

1230
00:39:41,299 --> 00:39:42,698
I got it. Creaking.

1231
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:43,898
Creaking?

1232
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:44,968
(Unintentional harsh words can cause a relationship to creak.)

1233
00:39:44,969 --> 00:39:45,998
That must be it.

1234
00:39:45,999 --> 00:39:47,968
(Unintentional harsh words can cause a relationship to creak.)

1235
00:39:47,969 --> 00:39:48,999
Correct.

1236
00:39:49,669 --> 00:39:51,368
(Sang Uk wins immunity.)

1237
00:39:51,369 --> 00:39:52,508
Tae Hyun has to pay!

1238
00:39:52,509 --> 00:39:54,278
But who even says that?

1239
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:55,508
(Tae Hyun has to pay.)

1240
00:39:55,509 --> 00:39:56,638
- I enjoyed the meal.
- Look at Tae Hyun.

1241
00:39:56,639 --> 00:39:57,809
Unbelievable.

1242
00:39:57,909 --> 00:40:00,348
Getting the correct answer caused our relationship to creak.

1243
00:40:00,349 --> 00:40:01,948
(Our relationship is creaking.)

1244
00:40:01,949 --> 00:40:03,079
Sorry.

1245
00:40:03,549 --> 00:40:04,819
- Okay.
- Thank you, Tae Hyun.

1246
00:40:04,989 --> 00:40:06,418
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

1247
00:40:06,419 --> 00:40:07,818
Gosh. The makeup.

1248
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:09,088
Paying is okay.

1249
00:40:09,089 --> 00:40:10,558
- Doing the makeup is the problem.
- It's a mission.

1250
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:11,588
(He's more worried about the makeup than the payment.)

1251
00:40:11,589 --> 00:40:13,188
Okay. Thank you.

1252
00:40:13,189 --> 00:40:14,429
We enjoyed the food.

1253
00:40:15,859 --> 00:40:16,859
Gosh. Creaky.

1254
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,375
(Tae Hyun is off to a bad start. Who's going to do the makeup?)

1255
00:40:19,399 --> 00:40:20,799
We should have cheonggukjang now.

1256
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:23,669
I have an upset stomach because I'm so hungry.

1257
00:40:25,739 --> 00:40:28,679
Gosh. This crosswalk is really long.

1258
00:40:29,179 --> 00:40:30,678
This is the main entrance.

1259
00:40:30,679 --> 00:40:32,319
(Going into the street of small theaters)

1260
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:34,449
Gosh. It's been so long since I came here.

1261
00:40:35,649 --> 00:40:37,018
Performing Arts Center.

1262
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:39,388
(As it's the hub of plays, theaters are found everywhere.)

1263
00:40:39,389 --> 00:40:41,389
See? They're still performing "Run for Your Wife."

1264
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:47,089
(While so many plays are being performed, )

1265
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:49,458
(what is the second lunch...)

1266
00:40:49,459 --> 00:40:52,528
(that will be performed here in the streets of theaters?)

1267
00:40:52,529 --> 00:40:54,999
(Menu recommendation in Daehak-ro, Act 2)

1268
00:40:55,469 --> 00:40:57,908
(LMR 2: Cheonggukjang)

1269
00:40:57,909 --> 00:41:00,438
- It just says "cheonggukjang." - It's here.

1270
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:01,638
(Cheonggukjang)

1271
00:41:01,639 --> 00:41:03,208
They have pork belly. You're in trouble.

1272
00:41:03,209 --> 00:41:05,048
It says, "just like how Mom made it."

1273
00:41:05,049 --> 00:41:06,578
They use a traditional method.

1274
00:41:06,579 --> 00:41:09,649
- They look very authentic.
- It's my second time having it.

1275
00:41:09,949 --> 00:41:11,449
Let's try traditional cheonggukjang.

1276
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:13,048
- Gosh. It's really...
- I can tell by the smell.

1277
00:41:13,049 --> 00:41:14,319
It's authentic.

1278
00:41:16,259 --> 00:41:21,359
(Filling up the hearts of starving actors, )

1279
00:41:22,429 --> 00:41:27,669
(the taste of the food made by Mom)

1280
00:41:32,709 --> 00:41:34,738
(LMR 2: Cheonggukjang)

1281
00:41:34,739 --> 00:41:37,278
- Hello.
- It smells like cheonggukjang.

1282
00:41:37,279 --> 00:41:38,808
- I can smell it.
- It smells good.

1283
00:41:38,809 --> 00:41:41,349
- I can smell it.
- As soon as we entered,

1284
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:44,618
I can't tell if it's cheonggukjang or the smell of our feet.

1285
00:41:44,619 --> 00:41:45,848
- That means it's authentic.
- Tae Hyun.

1286
00:41:45,849 --> 00:41:47,418
I'm about to eat now.

1287
00:41:47,419 --> 00:41:48,965
You're talking too much about the smelly feet.

1288
00:41:48,989 --> 00:41:50,958
What I'm saying is true.

1289
00:41:50,959 --> 00:41:53,428
- It smells like feet right away.
- Come on.

1290
00:41:53,429 --> 00:41:55,469
It's a scent from our body that we smell every day.

1291
00:41:55,659 --> 00:41:56,859
Hello.

1292
00:41:57,459 --> 00:41:59,129
You can come this way.

1293
00:41:59,299 --> 00:42:01,368
- Are you the owner here?
- Yes, I am.

1294
00:42:01,369 --> 00:42:02,369
- Are you the daughter?
- Yes.

1295
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:05,468
As my parents are growing old, we moved here.

1296
00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:08,078
I came here about ten years ago. How old is this place?

1297
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,378
Including the previous restaurant,

1298
00:42:11,379 --> 00:42:12,809
it's been 33 years.

1299
00:42:13,879 --> 00:42:16,578
I heard you were deeply attached to the Hakchon Theater.

1300
00:42:16,579 --> 00:42:20,248
When my parents first opened the restaurant,

1301
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:23,618
late Kim Min Ki started the Hakchon Theater too.

1302
00:42:23,619 --> 00:42:26,188
He was looking for a place for his actors to eat.

1303
00:42:26,189 --> 00:42:28,398
And he found us.

1304
00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:31,005
(He found this place while looking for a restaurant for his actors.)

1305
00:42:31,029 --> 00:42:34,299
(Hakchon Theater, a small theater located in Daehak-ro in 1991)

1306
00:42:34,539 --> 00:42:37,669
(And Kim Min Ki supported the actors from the back.)

1307
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:41,578
Since the beginning, my parents had fed...

1308
00:42:41,579 --> 00:42:45,209
everyone in the Hakchon Theater, including Kim Min Ki.

1309
00:42:47,309 --> 00:42:51,819
(Many artists from Hakchon came to this cheonggukjang place.)

1310
00:42:52,189 --> 00:42:54,288
- It was like their cafeteria.
- Exactly.

1311
00:42:54,289 --> 00:42:56,589
We still keep a ledger for the Hakchon.

1312
00:43:01,499 --> 00:43:07,269
(The memories remain just as they were.)

1313
00:43:08,239 --> 00:43:10,498
(Alongside the Hakchon Theater, )

1314
00:43:10,499 --> 00:43:12,768
(this place embraces the history of Daehak-ro.)

1315
00:43:12,769 --> 00:43:14,339
Okay, ma'am.

1316
00:43:14,739 --> 00:43:16,378
We'll order two premium cheonggukjang,

1317
00:43:16,379 --> 00:43:17,979
- Okay.
- one kimchi cheonggukjang,

1318
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:20,678
and two spicy stir-fried pork. And?

1319
00:43:20,679 --> 00:43:23,178
We'll order one soybean noodles to clean our palates.

1320
00:43:23,179 --> 00:43:25,619
- Okay. The order is...
- Also,

1321
00:43:25,949 --> 00:43:27,888
- do you have a regular Coke?
- Yes.

1322
00:43:27,889 --> 00:43:28,889
- We'll get two.
- Okay.

1323
00:43:28,889 --> 00:43:29,889
- No.
- What?

1324
00:43:29,890 --> 00:43:30,919
We'll place the order.

1325
00:43:31,759 --> 00:43:32,759
(A strong defense)

1326
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:33,858
That's all we need.

1327
00:43:33,859 --> 00:43:35,335
- One Coke... Order me a Coke.
- Then...

1328
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,199
- Yes. I want Coke.
- I really want Coke.

1329
00:43:37,699 --> 00:43:39,268
- And one soybean noodles.
- You can serve it later.

1330
00:43:39,269 --> 00:43:40,528
- Okay.
- Okay. Thank you.

1331
00:43:40,529 --> 00:43:42,168
- Thank you.
- Coke.

1332
00:43:42,169 --> 00:43:43,809
We don't need Coke. Don't give it to him.

1333
00:43:44,369 --> 00:43:46,108
Gosh. I really want to drink Coke.

1334
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:48,878
It was humid this morning,

1335
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:49,978
and I craved...

1336
00:43:49,979 --> 00:43:52,249
kimchi stew and cheonggukjang.

1337
00:43:52,779 --> 00:43:54,148
They also have kimchi stew.

1338
00:43:54,149 --> 00:43:55,518
Does your appetite change...

1339
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,848
- according to the weather?
- Of course.

1340
00:43:56,849 --> 00:43:58,189
I've been starving for so long,

1341
00:43:58,289 --> 00:43:59,488
so I just drank cold water.

1342
00:43:59,489 --> 00:44:01,188
I can feel it going down.

1343
00:44:01,189 --> 00:44:03,218
- It's in my stomach.
- Since it's empty.

1344
00:44:03,219 --> 00:44:06,328
I could feel the cold water brushing the wall of my stomach.

1345
00:44:06,329 --> 00:44:07,388
- Yes.
- And...

1346
00:44:07,389 --> 00:44:08,729
(At that moment...)

1347
00:44:09,199 --> 00:44:10,199
(The side dishes arrive before Dong Hyun gets hungrier.)

1348
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,528
I'll set the table first.

1349
00:44:11,529 --> 00:44:13,745
- I can already tell it's good.
- Look at the side dishes.

1350
00:44:13,769 --> 00:44:17,339
It has the vibe of the countryside in the past.

1351
00:44:17,469 --> 00:44:18,668
Goodness.

1352
00:44:18,669 --> 00:44:19,839
Bibimbap!

1353
00:44:20,409 --> 00:44:22,609
They will disappear in ten seconds.

1354
00:44:23,809 --> 00:44:25,848
After putting in cheonggukjang, it will be gone in three scoops.

1355
00:44:25,849 --> 00:44:27,278
(The side dishes are mouth-watering.)

1356
00:44:27,279 --> 00:44:28,749
Look at this young radish kimchi.

1357
00:44:29,419 --> 00:44:31,188
- Oh, my.
- It's here.

1358
00:44:31,189 --> 00:44:32,949
(Following the mouth-watering side dishes, )

1359
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,518
We can't ask questions again.

1360
00:44:35,519 --> 00:44:37,279
(the main dish, cheonggukjang, arrives too.)

1361
00:44:37,929 --> 00:44:42,259
(In the earthen pot simmering with vegetable broth, )

1362
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:48,899
(they put a generous amount of cheonggukjang.)

1363
00:44:51,239 --> 00:44:55,179
(Filled with rich and thick flavors)

1364
00:44:56,409 --> 00:45:02,219
(A mouthful of flavorfulness, cheonggukjang)

1365
00:45:02,349 --> 00:45:04,849
As you can see, it's all beans.

1366
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,248
It's filled with beans.

1367
00:45:06,249 --> 00:45:08,389
(Every spoonful is filled with beans.)

1368
00:45:08,719 --> 00:45:12,088
- Gosh. It looks good.
- This is really...

1369
00:45:12,089 --> 00:45:13,658
It must be tasty as is.

1370
00:45:13,659 --> 00:45:15,999
- Yes. It looks tasty.
- It's filled with beans.

1371
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:20,329
(He mixes it with rice to make it even tastier.)

1372
00:45:22,669 --> 00:45:25,869
(Taking a big bite)

1373
00:45:25,909 --> 00:45:29,039
(Seung Ho adds a little bit of gochujang.)

1374
00:45:29,139 --> 00:45:30,238
(Mixing...)

1375
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:33,309
(thoroughly)

1376
00:45:38,889 --> 00:45:41,989
(Yi Kyung tries a spoonful of cheonggukjang as is.)

1377
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:44,989
They set the standard.

1378
00:45:46,029 --> 00:45:47,588
Gosh. It's so light, and I love it.

1379
00:45:47,589 --> 00:45:49,558
I told you that you wouldn't regret it.

1380
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:50,829
This cheonggukjang is...

1381
00:45:51,269 --> 00:45:52,328
Seriously.

1382
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:55,299
I often eat cheonggukjang and biji stew at my granny's house.

1383
00:45:55,399 --> 00:45:58,368
It can be really good sometimes, but bland or salty at other times.

1384
00:45:58,369 --> 00:45:59,908
- It varies every time she makes it.
- Right.

1385
00:45:59,909 --> 00:46:03,739
When it tastes the best, it tastes like this.

1386
00:46:04,109 --> 00:46:06,029
It's because they've been making it for decades.

1387
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:09,548
It's light, yet it's still rich. I love it.

1388
00:46:09,549 --> 00:46:11,078
(The ultimate flavor they found through time and experience.)

1389
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:12,559
- No one would dislike it.
- Exactly.

1390
00:46:13,689 --> 00:46:15,488
I like the spicy stir-fried pork.

1391
00:46:15,489 --> 00:46:16,659
It's...

1392
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:19,058
(Taking a piece of the stir-fried pork)

1393
00:46:19,059 --> 00:46:20,958
- They serve it this way.
- It looks tasty.

1394
00:46:20,959 --> 00:46:21,959
It looks good.

1395
00:46:22,129 --> 00:46:24,229
This spicy stir-fried pork looks really tasty.

1396
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:28,839
(Savoring)

1397
00:46:28,969 --> 00:46:30,868
This stir-fried pork doesn't come...

1398
00:46:30,869 --> 00:46:31,938
with thick and strong-flavored sauce.

1399
00:46:31,939 --> 00:46:33,369
- Yes.
- I want to try it.

1400
00:46:33,509 --> 00:46:35,078
It melts in your mouth because it's so tender.

1401
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:38,578
It also resembles the homemade version.

1402
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:40,078
My aunt used to make it when I was young.

1403
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,578
- I love this kind of meat.
- It's served like that at schools.

1404
00:46:42,579 --> 00:46:44,518
You're right. It goes best with rice.

1405
00:46:44,519 --> 00:46:46,348
- Yes.
- You're right. It's just like that.

1406
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:47,349
It's refreshing.

1407
00:46:47,350 --> 00:46:48,590
For the first time on the show,

1408
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:50,259
we'll cancel the freeloading chance.

1409
00:46:50,519 --> 00:46:52,028
- Why?
- You won't have it anyway.

1410
00:46:52,029 --> 00:46:54,328
We can eat all of these ourselves.

1411
00:46:54,329 --> 00:46:56,458
(Reason: There will be no leftovers.)

1412
00:46:56,459 --> 00:46:57,498
What?

1413
00:46:57,499 --> 00:46:59,498
- But...
- Has the rule changed here?

1414
00:46:59,499 --> 00:47:01,199
Aren't they being real thugs?

1415
00:47:01,669 --> 00:47:02,669
In this case...

1416
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,008
"We had free foods, but you can't have it."

1417
00:47:05,009 --> 00:47:06,038
(I'll give it...)

1418
00:47:06,039 --> 00:47:07,738
(to myself.)

1419
00:47:07,739 --> 00:47:09,738
(From Dong Hyun to Dong Hyun)

1420
00:47:09,739 --> 00:47:10,739
(Laughing)

1421
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,378
Hey. If you're being this naughty,

1422
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:14,679
we can revive physical punishment.

1423
00:47:15,579 --> 00:47:18,388
Do you get it? We can punish you physically in this case.

1424
00:47:18,389 --> 00:47:19,548
That's right.

1425
00:47:19,549 --> 00:47:20,588
(I finished it.)

1426
00:47:20,589 --> 00:47:21,619
Did you finish it?

1427
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:23,119
(He finished it in the meantime.)

1428
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:24,789
- Already?
- Gosh. Amazing.

1429
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:27,428
- Here are fried eggs.
- Yes.

1430
00:47:27,429 --> 00:47:28,858
- Even the fried eggs are here.
- Gosh.

1431
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:30,659
- I love them.
- Isn't this unfair?

1432
00:47:30,759 --> 00:47:32,799
Usually, the fried eggs are...

1433
00:47:32,899 --> 00:47:34,768
Gosh. I'm sorry,

1434
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,538
but if you aren't going to finish the fried eggs...

1435
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:38,219
- They'll finish them.
- It's 150 dollars.

1436
00:47:38,869 --> 00:47:39,869
(I shouldn't have asked.)

1437
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:42,139
- It's a market price.
- It can't be 150 dollars.

1438
00:47:42,579 --> 00:47:44,419
- They're viable eggs.
- Are they golden eggs?

1439
00:47:44,949 --> 00:47:45,949
(Being sly)

1440
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:47,049
Are they golden eggs?

1441
00:47:47,749 --> 00:47:49,979
Can you give me a Coke?

1442
00:47:50,549 --> 00:47:51,718
The price has increased to 80 dollars.

1443
00:47:51,719 --> 00:47:53,648
Gosh. What's wrong with them?

1444
00:47:53,649 --> 00:47:55,388
You're unacceptable.

1445
00:47:55,389 --> 00:47:56,888
I might have to buy it with 80 dollars...

1446
00:47:56,889 --> 00:47:59,089
- to break their spirit.
- What?

1447
00:47:59,429 --> 00:48:00,958
This is driving me crazy.

1448
00:48:00,959 --> 00:48:03,998
I really want the fried eggs. Give me either an egg or a Coke.

1449
00:48:03,999 --> 00:48:06,729
We haven't played 20 Questions yet.

1450
00:48:06,929 --> 00:48:09,838
If you get it right,

1451
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,109
you should get some kind of benefits.

1452
00:48:13,809 --> 00:48:15,308
- I'll give you Coke right away.
- Coke?

1453
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,408
- Yes.
- Okay.

1454
00:48:16,409 --> 00:48:18,049
- If you get it, you'll get Coke.
- Okay.

1455
00:48:18,949 --> 00:48:21,078
- I'll say the sport, - Okay.

1456
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:23,719
Read the staff's faces and reactions,

1457
00:48:24,119 --> 00:48:25,148
and guess it right.

1458
00:48:25,149 --> 00:48:26,618
It's a glass of Coke, not a spoonful.

1459
00:48:26,619 --> 00:48:29,118
- I'll give you a whole can.
- A whole can? Okay.

1460
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:31,658
Let's go. Try it. You do it.

1461
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:32,659
The first question.

1462
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:33,688
(Guessing what sport Sang Uk plays)

1463
00:48:33,689 --> 00:48:34,858
(Which sport does he play?)

1464
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:36,128
- Of five events...
- Shooting?

1465
00:48:36,129 --> 00:48:40,399
(What sport does Sang Uk play? Shooting)

1466
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:42,168
Archery?

1467
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:44,339
(What sport does Sang Uk play? Archery)

1468
00:48:44,599 --> 00:48:46,568
(Silent)

1469
00:48:46,569 --> 00:48:49,808
(Their reaction isn't obvious.)

1470
00:48:49,809 --> 00:48:50,909
Fencing?

1471
00:48:51,239 --> 00:48:54,818
- Here are the soybean noodles.
- Okay.

1472
00:48:54,819 --> 00:48:58,688
We're at a critical moment. Why did you bring it now?

1473
00:48:58,689 --> 00:49:01,659
You made her serve it now to distract me.

1474
00:49:01,819 --> 00:49:03,888
- Look at the color.
- These are sugar and salt.

1475
00:49:03,889 --> 00:49:05,589
- We can add it as we please.
- Yes.

1476
00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:07,458
It's not white like the others.

1477
00:49:07,459 --> 00:49:08,898
They specialized in it.

1478
00:49:08,899 --> 00:49:10,929
I prefer sugar for it.

1479
00:49:11,129 --> 00:49:13,089
- For soybean noodles?
- No need to add anything.

1480
00:49:14,999 --> 00:49:17,039
If they're out of words, it means it's really good.

1481
00:49:17,069 --> 00:49:18,268
These black soybeans...

1482
00:49:18,269 --> 00:49:19,668
(Their eating show begins again.)

1483
00:49:19,669 --> 00:49:22,109
Does that color come from the black soybeans?

1484
00:49:24,039 --> 00:49:25,449
It looks like greens were mixed in.

1485
00:49:26,909 --> 00:49:28,009
I love it.

1486
00:49:30,419 --> 00:49:32,119
I added just a little bit of sugar.

1487
00:49:32,589 --> 00:49:35,418
It tastes like really tasty and a little sweet...

1488
00:49:35,419 --> 00:49:37,788
- matcha latte.
- I see.

1489
00:49:37,789 --> 00:49:39,329
I can taste a hint of green tea.

1490
00:49:40,059 --> 00:49:41,899
It's so flavorful.

1491
00:49:44,199 --> 00:49:45,569
I'm sorry to interrupt,

1492
00:49:45,769 --> 00:49:47,129
but is fencing the correct answer?

1493
00:49:47,829 --> 00:49:50,968
- Do you still have no idea?
- You didn't tell me the answer.

1494
00:49:50,969 --> 00:49:52,168
We won't tell you.

1495
00:49:52,169 --> 00:49:54,085
I'm no longer interested in your answer anymore.

1496
00:49:54,109 --> 00:49:55,938
- Really? Then forget about it.
- Let's forget about it.

1497
00:49:55,939 --> 00:49:57,415
- Forget about it. Move on.
- Don't do it.

1498
00:49:57,439 --> 00:49:58,979
- Now, take out your cards.
- Okay.

1499
00:49:59,109 --> 00:50:00,678
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

1500
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:02,378
You were going to get me a Coke.

1501
00:50:02,379 --> 00:50:03,418
(I can't let it slide.)

1502
00:50:03,419 --> 00:50:04,478
What is this place?

1503
00:50:04,479 --> 00:50:06,689
I'll never come here again. Don't call me again.

1504
00:50:06,989 --> 00:50:08,118
I'll never be on this show.

1505
00:50:08,119 --> 00:50:10,188
You can't be sulky like that.

1506
00:50:10,189 --> 00:50:11,218
I won't come here.

1507
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:12,229
(Passing the Coke)

1508
00:50:13,689 --> 00:50:15,798
I should feed the rascal child. Here.

1509
00:50:15,799 --> 00:50:18,098
- Look over there.
- He's sulky.

1510
00:50:18,099 --> 00:50:20,169
- That team's rascal boy.
- Nice.

1511
00:50:20,729 --> 00:50:22,168
He said he'd never come here again.

1512
00:50:22,169 --> 00:50:23,468
(Truly happy)

1513
00:50:23,469 --> 00:50:24,668
He has to come again.

1514
00:50:24,669 --> 00:50:25,939
So, he does play fencing.

1515
00:50:26,139 --> 00:50:27,338
(Sang Uk, the world's number 1 fencer)

1516
00:50:27,339 --> 00:50:29,539
- You didn't tell me.
- Please drink it at one go.

1517
00:50:29,809 --> 00:50:31,238
- At one go?
- You're drinking on behalf of me.

1518
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:32,378
- Okay. Bottoms up?
- We'll tell you once you drink it.

1519
00:50:32,379 --> 00:50:33,379
- I'll drink with you.
- Okay.

1520
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,508
He'll tell you when you drink it at one go.

1521
00:50:34,509 --> 00:50:36,018
(Together with Sang Uk, )

1522
00:50:36,019 --> 00:50:38,099
(he drinks it at one go for getting the quiz right.)

1523
00:50:39,149 --> 00:50:41,319
(Bubbling up)

1524
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:44,959
(Sighing)

1525
00:50:46,259 --> 00:50:47,959
- Okay. I'll give you the quiz.
- Okay.

1526
00:50:48,499 --> 00:50:51,128
Various beans were originated from Korea,

1527
00:50:51,129 --> 00:50:53,399
and there are many different names.

1528
00:50:53,499 --> 00:50:55,579
- This will be hard.
- Yes. The beans are difficult.

1529
00:50:55,699 --> 00:50:56,799
Please get it wrong.

1530
00:50:56,899 --> 00:50:58,608
The black-eyed peas are called mouse eye beans...

1531
00:50:58,609 --> 00:51:02,078
because they look like the eyes of a mouse.

1532
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:03,108
"Mouse eye beans."

1533
00:51:03,109 --> 00:51:05,348
Then why is seoritae, the black soybeans,

1534
00:51:05,349 --> 00:51:08,379
called "seoritae?"

1535
00:51:08,979 --> 00:51:10,048
This is so hard.

1536
00:51:10,049 --> 00:51:13,319
It's because... What is seoritae? Is it the black one?

1537
00:51:13,689 --> 00:51:15,235
- The black one.
- Isn't it the black one?

1538
00:51:15,259 --> 00:51:17,219
Can you show us what seoritae is?

1539
00:51:18,259 --> 00:51:19,958
Hold on. You can't do that. No.

1540
00:51:19,959 --> 00:51:21,128
- No.
- Are you going to show them...

1541
00:51:21,129 --> 00:51:22,328
- this easily?
- We're the ones...

1542
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,198
- to show them.
- We weren't allowed before.

1543
00:51:24,199 --> 00:51:26,728
- I'll find it and show it to them.
- Okay.

1544
00:51:26,729 --> 00:51:28,068
(Finding what it is for them)

1545
00:51:28,069 --> 00:51:29,798
- Okay. I'll show it.
- It had ears.

1546
00:51:29,799 --> 00:51:31,279
This is seoritae, the black soybeans.

1547
00:51:32,109 --> 00:51:33,309
Come on. What are you doing?

1548
00:51:35,179 --> 00:51:36,338
(Seoritae?)

1549
00:51:36,339 --> 00:51:38,509
That's what it is. I know it.

1550
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:40,049
I know that one.

1551
00:51:40,209 --> 00:51:41,448
- You know her, right?
- Seol Hui Tae.

1552
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:43,078
- Seol Hui Tae?
- You can guess it.

1553
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:44,179
She's grown up well.

1554
00:51:44,519 --> 00:51:46,048
- Hui Tae?
- It's a person's name.

1555
00:51:46,049 --> 00:51:47,448
- Where is the family name from?
- She's grown up fine.

1556
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:49,789
(Actually, it's Su Jin, Tae Hyun's youngest daughter.)

1557
00:51:50,219 --> 00:51:52,229
Come on. Show us the photo of seoritae.

1558
00:51:53,529 --> 00:51:54,998
(Looking for the real seoritae)

1559
00:51:54,999 --> 00:51:56,698
Seoritae. This is it.

1560
00:51:56,699 --> 00:51:57,899
I'll show it to you.

1561
00:51:57,999 --> 00:51:59,199
- I see.
- That's what it is.

1562
00:51:59,329 --> 00:52:00,368
I'll show it without a problem.

1563
00:52:00,369 --> 00:52:02,199
Seoritae are just black soybeans.

1564
00:52:02,539 --> 00:52:04,139
- They're black soybeans.
- I see.

1565
00:52:04,909 --> 00:52:05,968
They are just black.

1566
00:52:05,969 --> 00:52:06,969
(Staring)

1567
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:08,708
- Don't.
- I won't touch it.

1568
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,079
Can I see it up close?

1569
00:52:10,339 --> 00:52:11,408
I know the answer.

1570
00:52:11,409 --> 00:52:12,748
If you want to see it like that...

1571
00:52:12,749 --> 00:52:14,779
(Sang Uk, hear me out.)

1572
00:52:15,349 --> 00:52:16,979
Are they harvested in the winter?

1573
00:52:17,619 --> 00:52:18,649
Actually,

1574
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:20,559
"Seori," which means the frost,

1575
00:52:21,089 --> 00:52:23,235
- forms in the late fall.
- Can you show what they are?

1576
00:52:23,259 --> 00:52:24,719
- So?
- Beans.

1577
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,458
They might be harvested then.

1578
00:52:27,459 --> 00:52:29,535
(They might be harvested when the forst, seori, forms.)

1579
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:31,199
He's so smart.

1580
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:32,768
Do you know the answer?

1581
00:52:32,769 --> 00:52:34,069
(Daniel is so smart.)

1582
00:52:34,769 --> 00:52:37,199
How did Daniel figure it out?

1583
00:52:37,439 --> 00:52:40,409
It's been a while since I said it. Let's follow what it sounds like.

1584
00:52:40,969 --> 00:52:43,678
You eat these beans when the frost, seori, is formed.

1585
00:52:43,679 --> 00:52:45,249
Or you harvest them about that time.

1586
00:52:46,279 --> 00:52:48,948
Seori, the frost, and seoritae.

1587
00:52:48,949 --> 00:52:50,049
Seol Hui... Seol...

1588
00:52:50,619 --> 00:52:51,718
Seori, the frost, and seoritae.

1589
00:52:51,719 --> 00:52:53,018
(That's it.)

1590
00:52:53,019 --> 00:52:55,518
But wouldn't it have to do with how they look?

1591
00:52:55,519 --> 00:52:57,389
What's seori in the sense of a shape?

1592
00:52:58,089 --> 00:52:59,089
About "Seol?"

1593
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:01,058
I think the eyes of a mouse was a hint.

1594
00:53:01,059 --> 00:53:02,228
Seori, the frost.

1595
00:53:02,229 --> 00:53:04,058
I think it'd be similar to that.

1596
00:53:04,059 --> 00:53:05,428
(What does seoritae resemble when the other resembled mouse eyes?)

1597
00:53:05,429 --> 00:53:07,189
When we heard the word, it should be simple.

1598
00:53:07,569 --> 00:53:09,698
- I think it relates to their shape.
- I see.

1599
00:53:09,699 --> 00:53:10,699
You're right.

1600
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,815
Is it because it's covered in white as if it was covered in the frost?

1601
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:14,108
They have white parts on them.

1602
00:53:14,109 --> 00:53:15,438
They're not shiny black.

1603
00:53:15,439 --> 00:53:19,478
Like the white parts on dried persimmons,

1604
00:53:19,479 --> 00:53:21,979
the beans are covered in white stuff.

1605
00:53:23,219 --> 00:53:25,049
They are frosted beans, hence the name.

1606
00:53:25,189 --> 00:53:26,888
It's called seoritae in that sense.

1607
00:53:26,889 --> 00:53:28,149
I think there are two options.

1608
00:53:28,689 --> 00:53:32,028
One, the beans you eat when frost forms.

1609
00:53:32,029 --> 00:53:34,129
Two, they look...

1610
00:53:35,099 --> 00:53:36,399
shiny and frosted.

1611
00:53:36,499 --> 00:53:37,928
These are the two I can think of.

1612
00:53:37,929 --> 00:53:40,099
I'll follow whatever you decide.

1613
00:53:40,169 --> 00:53:41,369
The frosted looks.

1614
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:43,268
That's the only answer.

1615
00:53:43,269 --> 00:53:44,638
(The frosted look is the only answer.)

1616
00:53:44,639 --> 00:53:46,039
That's the only explanation, right?

1617
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:47,708
Then let's go with that one.

1618
00:53:47,709 --> 00:53:49,438
(Their opinions lean toward the frosted looks.)

1619
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,509
Okay. It's 80 dollars.

1620
00:53:51,109 --> 00:53:52,179
Should we go with it?

1621
00:53:52,279 --> 00:53:53,608
Yes. I think it's correct.

1622
00:53:53,609 --> 00:53:54,879
I'll say the answer.

1623
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:57,219
It's because they have a frosted look.

1624
00:53:58,449 --> 00:54:00,888
"It's because they have..."

1625
00:54:00,889 --> 00:54:02,059
We say it's frosted.

1626
00:54:02,419 --> 00:54:03,518
"a frosted look."

1627
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,058
That's why it's called seoritae.

1628
00:54:05,059 --> 00:54:06,728
(Because they look frosted.)

1629
00:54:06,729 --> 00:54:07,859
- Incorrect.
- What?

1630
00:54:08,629 --> 00:54:10,498
- Why?
- That wasn't it.

1631
00:54:10,499 --> 00:54:11,599
- No?
- No.

1632
00:54:11,799 --> 00:54:12,799
Then...

1633
00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:14,968
You shouldn't say it.

1634
00:54:14,969 --> 00:54:16,199
I'll go first. I got it.

1635
00:54:16,739 --> 00:54:18,569
You harvest and eat them when frost forms.

1636
00:54:19,169 --> 00:54:22,538
"You harvest and eat them when frost forms."

1637
00:54:22,539 --> 00:54:23,838
(The beans you harvest and eat during a frosty season)

1638
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,579
- Correct.
- I told you.

1639
00:54:26,209 --> 00:54:27,979
- You were right.
- That's correct.

1640
00:54:28,379 --> 00:54:29,949
- Good job.
- Thank you.

1641
00:54:30,379 --> 00:54:31,819
- Give us a quiz.
- Yes.

1642
00:54:32,549 --> 00:54:34,348
I'll give you a quiz on proverbs.

1643
00:54:34,349 --> 00:54:35,629
I have a bad feeling about this.

1644
00:54:35,659 --> 00:54:37,118
This is what the proverb means.

1645
00:54:37,119 --> 00:54:38,788
When you don't do as you're told...

1646
00:54:38,789 --> 00:54:41,459
and complain about it,

1647
00:54:41,659 --> 00:54:43,499
this proverb is used as a metaphor.

1648
00:54:43,629 --> 00:54:44,799
This is the proverb.

1649
00:54:44,929 --> 00:54:47,528
"If I told you to peel this with your butt, do it."

1650
00:54:47,529 --> 00:54:48,598
("If I told you to peel this with your butt, do it.")

1651
00:54:48,599 --> 00:54:49,638
(When one is complaining and not doing as they are told)

1652
00:54:49,639 --> 00:54:50,869
- I got it.
- Okay.

1653
00:54:51,399 --> 00:54:52,438
Peas.

1654
00:54:52,439 --> 00:54:53,638
(Peas)

1655
00:54:53,639 --> 00:54:55,108
Peel the peas with your butt?

1656
00:54:55,109 --> 00:54:57,578
- Do you put them in between?
- In between your butt cheeks?

1657
00:54:57,579 --> 00:54:58,978
That's a bit...

1658
00:54:58,979 --> 00:55:00,048
Hey, you.

1659
00:55:00,049 --> 00:55:01,718
- You, leave now.
- I painted the picture.

1660
00:55:01,719 --> 00:55:02,748
And it's a bit weird.

1661
00:55:02,749 --> 00:55:05,148
I mean, there can be a bunch of peas.

1662
00:55:05,149 --> 00:55:07,188
- Peel the peas with your butt?
- There are peanuts too.

1663
00:55:07,189 --> 00:55:08,588
- Think about it.
- Use your butt to...

1664
00:55:08,589 --> 00:55:09,858
That's why it's a proverb.

1665
00:55:09,859 --> 00:55:12,158
How strong does your sphincter have to be?

1666
00:55:12,159 --> 00:55:13,688
I mean, you can rub them with your butt.

1667
00:55:13,689 --> 00:55:15,459
You need tentacles on your sphincter.

1668
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:19,428
The proverbs are always in extremes.

1669
00:55:19,429 --> 00:55:21,368
- Okay. Incorrect.
- Even the belly button yawns.

1670
00:55:21,369 --> 00:55:22,439
Incorrect.

1671
00:55:22,499 --> 00:55:24,699
What can you peel with your butt?

1672
00:55:24,839 --> 00:55:26,169
Something like a chestnut burr.

1673
00:55:26,509 --> 00:55:27,939
Don't say it out loud.

1674
00:55:28,339 --> 00:55:29,508
I thought of it too.

1675
00:55:29,509 --> 00:55:32,349
But doesn't it sound so bad?

1676
00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:33,748
It's too cruel, isn't it?

1677
00:55:33,749 --> 00:55:35,119
- It's gory.
- Yes.

1678
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:36,249
- I got it.
- Okay.

1679
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:37,279
Chestnut.

1680
00:55:37,619 --> 00:55:38,749
Chestnut?

1681
00:55:39,319 --> 00:55:40,319
You got it.

1682
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:42,058
(No, it can't be.)

1683
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:43,088
I think it's correct.

1684
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,089
(Chestnut)

1685
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,128
- Correct.
- Yes!

1686
00:55:45,129 --> 00:55:46,328
(Chestnut)

1687
00:55:46,329 --> 00:55:48,059
You shouldn't have told him.

1688
00:55:48,389 --> 00:55:50,499
No. I wrote it here myself.

1689
00:55:50,859 --> 00:55:52,568
This is fun. It's a battle between the older ones.

1690
00:55:52,569 --> 00:55:54,028
- The vibe is...
- I don't feel good about it.

1691
00:55:54,029 --> 00:55:55,638
- It's either you or me.
- I have a bad feeling.

1692
00:55:55,639 --> 00:55:56,668
It's one of us.

1693
00:55:56,669 --> 00:55:58,668
You and I should choose the same team later on.

1694
00:55:58,669 --> 00:56:00,809
- We should bring it to an end.
- Goodness.

1695
00:56:00,939 --> 00:56:01,978
Let's go.

1696
00:56:01,979 --> 00:56:03,578
Let's go. Seriously.

1697
00:56:03,579 --> 00:56:04,709
(Let's go.)

1698
00:56:05,479 --> 00:56:06,479
Thanks for the food.

1699
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,708
- Thank you.
- No.

1700
00:56:07,709 --> 00:56:09,819
- I love it.
- Thank you.

1701
00:56:10,549 --> 00:56:11,578
Thank you.

1702
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:14,149
(Total: 86 dollars)

1703
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:18,529
(The joyful lunch comes to an end.)

1704
00:56:21,329 --> 00:56:22,528
I'll clap the slate.

1705
00:56:22,529 --> 00:56:23,599
(Current time: 4:57pm)

1706
00:56:23,729 --> 00:56:25,868
(They're gathering back after a short break.)

1707
00:56:25,869 --> 00:56:26,969
Is it all right?

1708
00:56:27,629 --> 00:56:28,638
Take a seat.

1709
00:56:28,639 --> 00:56:30,345
He already plans out how to act when he gets here.

1710
00:56:30,369 --> 00:56:31,849
- Sit in the order of arrival.
- Sit.

1711
00:56:31,909 --> 00:56:33,168
We're sitting in the order we arrive.

1712
00:56:33,169 --> 00:56:34,169
- The order of arrival.
- Okay.

1713
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:35,878
I think Dong Hyun will sit at the end.

1714
00:56:35,879 --> 00:56:36,978
There's no doubt about it.

1715
00:56:36,979 --> 00:56:38,378
Should we get rid of a chair?

1716
00:56:38,379 --> 00:56:39,878
Let's remove a chair.

1717
00:56:39,879 --> 00:56:41,279
- Let's take it out.
- Take it out.

1718
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:43,118
Good.

1719
00:56:43,119 --> 00:56:45,219
(The chair for the last one is placed far away.)

1720
00:56:45,919 --> 00:56:47,188
(How exciting!)

1721
00:56:47,189 --> 00:56:48,489
- Tae Hyun.
- Yes?

1722
00:56:49,319 --> 00:56:51,788
If Dong Hyun makes excuses again,

1723
00:56:51,789 --> 00:56:53,429
you should scold him.

1724
00:56:53,989 --> 00:56:56,029
- Tell him that he's selfish.
- That he's selfish.

1725
00:56:56,499 --> 00:56:58,828
I told you about it before.

1726
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:01,299
After coming here the last time,

1727
00:57:01,529 --> 00:57:04,099
I said I personally enjoyed Handsome Guys the most.

1728
00:57:04,269 --> 00:57:05,438
That's what he's been telling people.

1729
00:57:05,439 --> 00:57:06,439
- Really?
- Really.

1730
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,468
(Really?)

1731
00:57:07,469 --> 00:57:09,508
But don't they hate that in "Running Man?"

1732
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,338
I say this personally.

1733
00:57:11,339 --> 00:57:12,548
When someone asks him personally.

1734
00:57:12,549 --> 00:57:14,479
I talked to my family...

1735
00:57:14,709 --> 00:57:16,118
and friends from high school.

1736
00:57:16,119 --> 00:57:17,949
This will make headlines.

1737
00:57:18,149 --> 00:57:19,388
It's...

1738
00:57:19,389 --> 00:57:21,648
(Okay. Let me see.)

1739
00:57:21,649 --> 00:57:23,388
It's one of the joint winners.

1740
00:57:23,389 --> 00:57:25,288
It's so easy to make headlines.

1741
00:57:25,289 --> 00:57:26,828
Choi Daniel says, "Of all variety shows,"

1742
00:57:26,829 --> 00:57:28,328
"I enjoyed Handsome Guys the most."

1743
00:57:28,329 --> 00:57:30,009
"Cha Tae Hyun is better than Yoo Jae Suk."

1744
00:57:30,259 --> 00:57:31,798
- Good.
- That's a good one.

1745
00:57:31,799 --> 00:57:33,168
- The Cha line.
- "He transfers to the Cha line."

1746
00:57:33,169 --> 00:57:34,999
(Cha line over Yoo line.)

1747
00:57:35,169 --> 00:57:37,198
We talked so much,

1748
00:57:37,199 --> 00:57:39,208
- but he's still not here.
- We've been...

1749
00:57:39,209 --> 00:57:40,209
Hello.

1750
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:42,608
- Gosh.
- Here's today's guest.

1751
00:57:42,609 --> 00:57:44,408
Hi. I'm today's guest.

1752
00:57:44,409 --> 00:57:46,449
Okay. Where were you?

1753
00:57:46,949 --> 00:57:48,079
I slept for a while.

1754
00:57:48,949 --> 00:57:51,109
- You're so confident.
- I was going to go to the gym.

1755
00:57:51,249 --> 00:57:53,049
So, why are you late?

1756
00:57:54,519 --> 00:57:55,589
Am I late?

1757
00:57:57,059 --> 00:57:58,059
Tae Hyun.

1758
00:57:58,789 --> 00:58:00,129
- Tae Hyun.
- That's new.

1759
00:58:00,389 --> 00:58:01,428
That's a new excuse.

1760
00:58:01,429 --> 00:58:03,198
- Gosh. That was new.
- That's...

1761
00:58:03,199 --> 00:58:04,828
- He pretends as if he's not late.
- I...

1762
00:58:04,829 --> 00:58:06,299
Think of me as a cyborg.

1763
00:58:06,569 --> 00:58:08,429
I get in the van when someone pushes my back.

1764
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:10,869
When someone kicks me, I get off the van.

1765
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:12,708
I go upstairs if they tell me to.

1766
00:58:12,709 --> 00:58:14,408
When I was getting out of the van, he said, "Run."

1767
00:58:14,409 --> 00:58:15,509
So, I ran.

1768
00:58:16,779 --> 00:58:18,178
- You're a cyborg.
- That's why you were fast.

1769
00:58:18,179 --> 00:58:19,948
My manager told me to run.

1770
00:58:19,949 --> 00:58:21,449
So, I ran.

1771
00:58:22,219 --> 00:58:24,179
- He was downstairs.
- Am I late? I'm sorry.

1772
00:58:24,379 --> 00:58:25,589
Sorry for being late.

1773
00:58:25,789 --> 00:58:27,989
Is Seung Ho the last to arrive?

1774
00:58:28,089 --> 00:58:29,418
Seung Ho is never late.

1775
00:58:29,419 --> 00:58:31,588
Exactly. He's usually never late.

1776
00:58:31,589 --> 00:58:34,788
By the way, what does Seung Ho do exactly?

1777
00:58:34,789 --> 00:58:35,828
Is he...

1778
00:58:35,829 --> 00:58:37,528
Is he an athlete or an actor?

1779
00:58:37,529 --> 00:58:39,328
Do you want to guess it too?

1780
00:58:39,329 --> 00:58:40,998
- Play another 20 questions.
- On my phone,

1781
00:58:40,999 --> 00:58:42,438
he's saved as a soccer player.

1782
00:58:42,439 --> 00:58:44,239
Did you save him as a soccer player?

1783
00:58:44,369 --> 00:58:46,168
How come I don't have his number?

1784
00:58:46,169 --> 00:58:47,668
- Hey.
- It's not here.

1785
00:58:47,669 --> 00:58:50,269
- He's not saved as a soccer player.
- You don't have his number.

1786
00:58:50,539 --> 00:58:51,879
It's here. See?

1787
00:58:52,579 --> 00:58:54,278
Younger brother Seung Ho.

1788
00:58:54,279 --> 00:58:56,379
Soccer, big, Handsome Guys.

1789
00:58:56,979 --> 00:58:58,578
What's "big, Handsome Guys?"

1790
00:58:58,579 --> 00:58:59,689
This is it.

1791
00:59:00,619 --> 00:59:02,288
- Younger brother Seung Ho.
- Younger brother Seung Ho.

1792
00:59:02,289 --> 00:59:05,359
Soccer, big, Handsome Guys.

1793
00:59:06,159 --> 00:59:07,588
I wrote what I felt.

1794
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:09,599
- What's with "big?" - Where are you going?

1795
00:59:10,259 --> 00:59:11,729
Sorry. I need to wake up.

1796
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:13,928
My manager and I fell asleep together.

1797
00:59:13,929 --> 00:59:15,569
Are you going to talk outside the camera?

1798
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:17,138
He's talking outside the frame.

1799
00:59:17,139 --> 00:59:18,398
- Why are you talking over there?
- But...

1800
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,439
As soon as I opened my eyes,

1801
00:59:21,209 --> 00:59:23,185
- I said, "What time is it?" - Did it feel like a dream?

1802
00:59:23,209 --> 00:59:24,439
I check the time.

1803
00:59:24,879 --> 00:59:26,359
"Wasn't it supposed to start at 5pm?"

1804
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:28,408
He does that.

1805
00:59:28,409 --> 00:59:29,478
(A realistic reason for being late)

1806
00:59:29,479 --> 00:59:31,418
I put on the mic as soon as I opened my eyes.

1807
00:59:31,419 --> 00:59:33,718
Sorry. I slept for an hour and a half.

1808
00:59:33,719 --> 00:59:36,218
He's a baby.

1809
00:59:36,219 --> 00:59:38,159
(The older guys find him adorable.)

1810
00:59:38,419 --> 00:59:41,388
What is he doing over there?

1811
00:59:41,389 --> 00:59:42,728
Take the chair and come quickly.

1812
00:59:42,729 --> 00:59:45,098
(Stretching to wake up)

1813
00:59:45,099 --> 00:59:46,228
He's half asleep and half awake.

1814
00:59:46,229 --> 00:59:47,668
- Why did you...
- You can sit over there.

1815
00:59:47,669 --> 00:59:49,068
He took it in the meantime.

1816
00:59:49,069 --> 00:59:50,598
(He comes back in the frame with coffee to wake up.)

1817
00:59:50,599 --> 00:59:51,698
I'll sit here for a moment.

1818
00:59:51,699 --> 00:59:53,208
Good. I'm his guardian.

1819
00:59:53,209 --> 00:59:55,838
Look. He casually sits in the seat for the person who came first.

1820
00:59:55,839 --> 00:59:57,308
- That's right.
- See? This is what happens.

1821
00:59:57,309 --> 00:59:58,848
(Rascal Seung Ho takes the seat for the 1st place.)

1822
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:01,108
Seung Ho doesn't get flustered...

1823
01:00:01,109 --> 01:00:02,378
in any situation.

1824
01:00:02,379 --> 01:00:04,118
Well, I'm startled.

1825
01:00:04,119 --> 01:00:05,595
This is something to be apologetic about.

1826
01:00:05,619 --> 01:00:06,889
How cute!

1827
01:00:08,249 --> 01:00:09,589
I was startled.

1828
01:00:09,919 --> 01:00:11,119
This is fun.

1829
01:00:12,089 --> 01:00:13,089
Where should we go for dinner?

1830
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:14,929
Who will recommend the dinner menu?

1831
01:00:14,959 --> 01:00:16,199
Daehak-ro is...

1832
01:00:16,299 --> 01:00:18,028
famous for wrap parties.

1833
01:00:18,029 --> 01:00:19,628
- That's right.
- There are many theater companies.

1834
01:00:19,629 --> 01:00:20,899
The first menu is...

1835
01:00:20,999 --> 01:00:22,199
grilled stew.

1836
01:00:22,269 --> 01:00:24,039
- Grilled stew?
- Grilled stew?

1837
01:00:24,299 --> 01:00:26,068
(Is this a stew...)

1838
01:00:26,069 --> 01:00:27,839
(or a grill?)

1839
01:00:28,269 --> 01:00:31,809
(The specialty of Daehak-ro, grilled stew!)

1840
01:00:31,879 --> 01:00:33,878
The second menu is something everyone knows.

1841
01:00:33,879 --> 01:00:35,399
It's the go-to place for team dinners,

1842
01:00:35,449 --> 01:00:36,748
- hof.
- What?

1843
01:00:36,749 --> 01:00:38,219
- Hof?
- Yes. Hof.

1844
01:00:38,349 --> 01:00:42,459
(Familiar vibe and unfamiliar menu)

1845
01:00:42,819 --> 01:00:46,629
(A hof with tasty pizza)

1846
01:00:47,059 --> 01:00:51,129
(Daehak-ro DMR, grilled stew versus hof)

1847
01:00:51,199 --> 01:00:52,999
- I'm curious about grilled stew.
- Then...

1848
01:00:53,029 --> 01:00:54,868
Do we get a stew and a grilled dish?

1849
01:00:54,869 --> 01:00:55,939
Grilled fish?

1850
01:00:56,039 --> 01:00:57,039
Are you curious?

1851
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,938
- Then you should choose it.
- Grilled stew.

1852
01:00:58,939 --> 01:01:00,968
- The name of the dish is a hint.
- We shouldn't ask more.

1853
01:01:00,969 --> 01:01:03,208
- I'm curious.
- Grilled stew.

1854
01:01:03,209 --> 01:01:04,578
The grilled stew place...

1855
01:01:04,579 --> 01:01:06,619
must be a restaurant that requires a two-hour wait.

1856
01:01:06,849 --> 01:01:08,548
My stomach is still full...

1857
01:01:08,549 --> 01:01:10,179
from the food I ate earlier.

1858
01:01:11,049 --> 01:01:12,219
I want a refreshing drink.

1859
01:01:12,689 --> 01:01:14,248
I don't care what I get.

1860
01:01:14,249 --> 01:01:16,358
- I want grilled stew.
- Grilled stew?

1861
01:01:16,359 --> 01:01:17,888
Did you raise your hand earlier? Go ahead and say it.

1862
01:01:17,889 --> 01:01:18,988
I want grilled stew.

1863
01:01:18,989 --> 01:01:20,029
(I want grilled stew.)

1864
01:01:20,129 --> 01:01:21,129
He's so funny.

1865
01:01:21,789 --> 01:01:23,598
He picked hurriedly before all the spots were filled.

1866
01:01:23,599 --> 01:01:25,398
I'm sure all the spots will be filled.

1867
01:01:25,399 --> 01:01:27,668
- I'll go to a hof with Tae Hyun.
- Hof.

1868
01:01:27,669 --> 01:01:29,739
- I'll go to a hof.
- Okay.

1869
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:31,569
Dong Hyun, Seung Ho, and Sang Uk...

1870
01:01:31,669 --> 01:01:33,038
chose the grilled stew.

1871
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:35,478
Daniel, Tae Hyun, and I chose the hof.

1872
01:01:35,479 --> 01:01:36,638
The evening at Daehak-ro...

1873
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,839
starts with grilled stew.

1874
01:01:37,909 --> 01:01:39,108
- Okay.
- Hof comes second.

1875
01:01:39,109 --> 01:01:40,208
- That's right.
- Okay.

1876
01:01:40,209 --> 01:01:41,379
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1877
01:01:41,549 --> 01:01:43,319
I'm excited. I always get excited.

1878
01:01:43,519 --> 01:01:45,249
- It's thrilling.
- I'm hungry.

1879
01:01:45,689 --> 01:01:46,818
The weather is nice.

1880
01:01:46,819 --> 01:01:47,819
(The evening at Daehak-ro is bright thanks to the longer day.)

1881
01:01:47,820 --> 01:01:49,458
The day has definitely become longer.

1882
01:01:49,459 --> 01:01:52,018
(The evening at Daehak-ro is bright thanks to the longer day.)

1883
01:01:52,019 --> 01:01:54,258
Isn't this the Street of Youth?

1884
01:01:54,259 --> 01:01:55,529
The Street of Youth.

1885
01:01:55,559 --> 01:01:58,258
This is the main street for food.

1886
01:01:58,259 --> 01:02:00,005
(They walk down the Street of Youth that's filled with Gen Zers.)

1887
01:02:00,029 --> 01:02:02,029
I walked down this street every day.

1888
01:02:02,299 --> 01:02:03,369
- This street?
- Yes.

1889
01:02:03,539 --> 01:02:04,798
You reach Sungkyunkwan University if you go this way.

1890
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,869
That's right.

1891
01:02:06,139 --> 01:02:08,268
- The academy was in front of it.
- Sungkyunkwan University.

1892
01:02:08,269 --> 01:02:10,185
- I remember this place.
- Sungkyunkwan University.

1893
01:02:10,209 --> 01:02:11,578
I remember this place.

1894
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:13,079
It's like downtown Daejeon, right?

1895
01:02:13,749 --> 01:02:15,455
- It's like downtown Daejeon.
- It looks similar.

1896
01:02:15,479 --> 01:02:16,918
Come to think of it...

1897
01:02:16,919 --> 01:02:19,018
(Rascal Seung Ho sees something and stops in his track.)

1898
01:02:19,019 --> 01:02:20,088
What are you photographing?

1899
01:02:20,089 --> 01:02:21,918
(What are you photographing?)

1900
01:02:21,919 --> 01:02:23,819
- Yourself?
- That place...

1901
01:02:23,889 --> 01:02:26,888
is meaningful for me and my friends.

1902
01:02:26,889 --> 01:02:28,105
(Daehak-ro is full of memories he wants to share with his friends.)

1903
01:02:28,129 --> 01:02:29,958
You and I didn't have a chance to come to a place like this.

1904
01:02:29,959 --> 01:02:31,128
We never had a chance.

1905
01:02:31,129 --> 01:02:33,399
I'm busy checking out the place.

1906
01:02:34,169 --> 01:02:35,468
You and I...

1907
01:02:35,469 --> 01:02:37,769
- I'm busy checking out the place.
- How should I put it?

1908
01:02:37,869 --> 01:02:39,638
- Tae Hyun.
- I feel like I'm abroad.

1909
01:02:39,639 --> 01:02:41,608
- Abroad?
- I feel like I'm abroad.

1910
01:02:41,609 --> 01:02:42,978
Seriously.

1911
01:02:42,979 --> 01:02:44,179
This is the place.

1912
01:02:44,609 --> 01:02:47,278
- This place? P Land?
- P Land?

1913
01:02:47,279 --> 01:02:48,978
- It can't be P Land.
- It's this restaurant.

1914
01:02:48,979 --> 01:02:50,678
- G.S. Grilled stew.
- G.S.

1915
01:02:50,679 --> 01:02:51,849
- G.S.
- G.S.

1916
01:02:51,979 --> 01:02:53,048
- It's the G.S. place.
- Grilled stew.

1917
01:02:53,049 --> 01:02:55,189
Hey, they don't sell grilled fish.

1918
01:02:55,289 --> 01:02:56,618
It wasn't grilled fish.

1919
01:02:56,619 --> 01:02:58,088
Did you expect something like grilled fish?

1920
01:02:58,089 --> 01:03:00,189
I thought it'd be a fish dish.

1921
01:03:00,429 --> 01:03:01,928
If you know the dish...

1922
01:03:01,929 --> 01:03:04,210
(At that moment, elderly customers enter the restaurant.)

1923
01:03:04,599 --> 01:03:05,998
- They're entering right away.
- Hey,

1924
01:03:05,999 --> 01:03:07,598
shouldn't we hurry up and enter?

1925
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:09,238
- We'll lose our seats.
- Shall we go inside?

1926
01:03:09,239 --> 01:03:10,799
- Let's go.
- The tables are full.

1927
01:03:11,869 --> 01:03:13,838
There are so many play posters.

1928
01:03:13,839 --> 01:03:15,508
- Gosh.
- Gosh, the place is packed.

1929
01:03:15,509 --> 01:03:18,438
(Packed)

1930
01:03:18,439 --> 01:03:19,848
- Hello.
- What's this?

1931
01:03:19,849 --> 01:03:21,408
- Hello.
- Hello.

1932
01:03:21,409 --> 01:03:23,919
(The hall is full of customers of all genders and ages.)

1933
01:03:24,479 --> 01:03:26,119
Everyone is eating that dish.

1934
01:03:26,189 --> 01:03:27,788
They're boiling something in an aluminum tray.

1935
01:03:27,789 --> 01:03:30,159
I know. It's like ramyeon you eat at the Han River.

1936
01:03:30,189 --> 01:03:32,428
What are you eating? Is it G.S.?

1937
01:03:32,429 --> 01:03:33,728
- Yes.
- G.S.

1938
01:03:33,729 --> 01:03:35,258
- I guess it's famous.
- Won't you eat meat?

1939
01:03:35,259 --> 01:03:36,798
That's how it looks.

1940
01:03:36,799 --> 01:03:38,305
(Looking at the first menu makes them even more curious.)

1941
01:03:38,329 --> 01:03:41,099
(DMR 1, Grilled stew)

1942
01:03:41,529 --> 01:03:43,668
(This restaurant has remained in the same place for 20 years...)

1943
01:03:43,669 --> 01:03:45,909
(and existed throughout the history of Daehak-ro.)

1944
01:03:47,569 --> 01:03:50,538
I had the first team dinner here when I was a freshman.

1945
01:03:50,539 --> 01:03:52,308
Since then, I mostly come here...

1946
01:03:52,309 --> 01:03:53,609
when I drink.

1947
01:03:55,009 --> 01:03:56,679
It's very cost-effective.

1948
01:03:56,849 --> 01:03:58,048
We can order G.S...

1949
01:03:58,049 --> 01:03:59,748
and drink a bottle after a bottle,

1950
01:03:59,749 --> 01:04:01,218
so it's nice.

1951
01:04:01,219 --> 01:04:02,388
(A students' cost-effective haven that's introduced by seniors)

1952
01:04:02,389 --> 01:04:03,988
Since 2008,

1953
01:04:03,989 --> 01:04:06,628
I've had many team dinners here with my colleagues...

1954
01:04:06,629 --> 01:04:08,829
from plays and musicals.

1955
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:12,269
Even in the time of my seniors, this restaurant lived...

1956
01:04:12,769 --> 01:04:14,868
through the history of Daehak-ro.

1957
01:04:14,869 --> 01:04:17,399
It's like the mecca of team dinners.

1958
01:04:21,739 --> 01:04:24,839
(In the name of grilled stew)

1959
01:04:24,939 --> 01:04:28,708
(Daehak-ro Menu Recommendation, Act 3)

1960
01:04:28,709 --> 01:04:32,079
(DMR 1, Grilled stew)

1961
01:04:32,449 --> 01:04:33,618
- Sir.
- My goodness.

1962
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:35,889
- Hello.
- Hello.

1963
01:04:36,589 --> 01:04:37,959
- He's handsome.
- Oh, my.

1964
01:04:38,259 --> 01:04:39,758
He's so cool.

1965
01:04:39,759 --> 01:04:41,558
He's a fashionable middle-aged man.

1966
01:04:41,559 --> 01:04:42,628
Sir, I feel like...

1967
01:04:42,629 --> 01:04:43,728
You were in plays, right?

1968
01:04:43,729 --> 01:04:44,858
- Yes.
- He has that vibe.

1969
01:04:44,859 --> 01:04:45,868
I see. I can see that.

1970
01:04:45,869 --> 01:04:46,998
You have that vibe.

1971
01:04:46,999 --> 01:04:47,999
You have distinct facial features.

1972
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,968
I wouldn't call myself an actor.

1973
01:04:49,969 --> 01:04:51,598
I primarily run this restaurant,

1974
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:52,968
but actors sometimes invite me to star in their plays.

1975
01:04:52,969 --> 01:04:54,809
Then I act once in a while.

1976
01:04:55,469 --> 01:04:56,915
- I star in plays once in a while.
- I see.

1977
01:04:56,939 --> 01:04:58,938
You star in plays and run a restaurant.

1978
01:04:58,939 --> 01:05:00,548
On my way in,

1979
01:05:00,549 --> 01:05:02,978
- I saw so many play posters.
- Seriously.

1980
01:05:02,979 --> 01:05:05,278
Apparently, this place is famous...

1981
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,518
as the theater actors' favorite spot for wrap parties and team dinners.

1982
01:05:07,519 --> 01:05:09,558
This is Daehak-ro. In Daehak-ro,

1983
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:11,659
the actors are the owners.

1984
01:05:11,719 --> 01:05:12,858
(This actor is moved.)

1985
01:05:12,859 --> 01:05:14,188
- That's how it is here.
- How cool.

1986
01:05:14,189 --> 01:05:16,429
I make a living thanks to the actors,

1987
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:19,869
so I always put them first.

1988
01:05:20,169 --> 01:05:22,445
- That's a great mindset.
- I make a living thanks to them.

1989
01:05:22,469 --> 01:05:23,538
On my way in,

1990
01:05:23,539 --> 01:05:26,268
I saw customers boil food inside a rectangular aluminum tray.

1991
01:05:26,269 --> 01:05:27,708
- Yes.
- Is that G.S.?

1992
01:05:27,709 --> 01:05:29,779
- What's G.S.?
- G.S. is...

1993
01:05:29,939 --> 01:05:32,378
the Korean-style shabu shabu.

1994
01:05:32,379 --> 01:05:33,608
(The Korean-style shabu shabu, G.S.)

1995
01:05:33,609 --> 01:05:36,078
Most shabu shabu places make the dish clear,

1996
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:39,548
but I make it spicy. That's the difference.

1997
01:05:39,549 --> 01:05:41,589
- You make it like a stew.
- Yes.

1998
01:05:41,889 --> 01:05:44,288
- Is it a mix of a stew and a grill?
- That's what it is.

1999
01:05:44,289 --> 01:05:47,388
You don't dip it in a sauce.

2000
01:05:47,389 --> 01:05:49,158
You'll get seasoned green onions.

2001
01:05:49,159 --> 01:05:50,928
The saltiness will be perfect...

2002
01:05:50,929 --> 01:05:52,868
if you eat the dish with seasoned green onions.

2003
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:54,168
(Meat in the stew can be eaten with seasoned green onions.)

2004
01:05:54,169 --> 01:05:55,838
I've never heard of the dish.

2005
01:05:55,839 --> 01:05:57,839
- What should we order?
- I know.

2006
01:05:58,469 --> 01:06:00,068
I'll help you with the order.

2007
01:06:00,069 --> 01:06:03,078
The most popular one is the three-person beef brisket set.

2008
01:06:03,079 --> 01:06:04,308
Beef brisket G.S. set.

2009
01:06:04,309 --> 01:06:05,948
- Let's go with that one.
- Yes.

2010
01:06:05,949 --> 01:06:07,549
- We have to eat it.
- Dong Hyun,

2011
01:06:07,779 --> 01:06:08,978
don't you want some grilled meat?

2012
01:06:08,979 --> 01:06:09,979
Where is grilled meat on the menu?

2013
01:06:09,980 --> 01:06:11,748
These are grilled meats.

2014
01:06:11,749 --> 01:06:12,819
Meat?

2015
01:06:13,389 --> 01:06:15,048
Will you order that as well?

2016
01:06:15,049 --> 01:06:16,458
(Will they order grilled meat on top of grilled stew?)

2017
01:06:16,459 --> 01:06:18,559
- As for me, - I don't want it.

2018
01:06:18,689 --> 01:06:22,059
I ate three bowls of rice with cheonggukjang an hour ago.

2019
01:06:22,089 --> 01:06:23,228
You ate them as well.

2020
01:06:23,229 --> 01:06:24,229
(I did too, okay?)

2021
01:06:24,230 --> 01:06:26,229
I was right next to you.

2022
01:06:26,299 --> 01:06:27,399
They can eat everything.

2023
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:28,669
Then...

2024
01:06:28,729 --> 01:06:30,215
we'll order three servings of grilled beef brisket...

2025
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:31,998
and the three-person beef brisket G.S. set.

2026
01:06:31,999 --> 01:06:33,815
- And three cans of Coke Zero.
- That'll be the order.

2027
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:35,108
- That'll be the order.
- Okay.

2028
01:06:35,109 --> 01:06:36,638
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2029
01:06:36,639 --> 01:06:38,078
Sir, don't worry about them.

2030
01:06:38,079 --> 01:06:39,648
- Understood.
- They'll eat all the food.

2031
01:06:39,649 --> 01:06:40,708
Okay.

2032
01:06:40,709 --> 01:06:42,149
"Understood."

2033
01:06:42,979 --> 01:06:44,848
(Thus, a feast gets prepared.)

2034
01:06:44,849 --> 01:06:46,019
Why are there so many?

2035
01:06:46,119 --> 01:06:47,318
Green onions.

2036
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:48,418
(The scene stealer of G.S., seasoned green onions)

2037
01:06:48,419 --> 01:06:51,088
(And this is the dish.)

2038
01:06:51,089 --> 01:06:52,928
That's the dish we saw outside.

2039
01:06:52,929 --> 01:06:54,329
(The mysterious dish, G.S.)

2040
01:06:54,489 --> 01:06:56,158
(Staring intently)

2041
01:06:56,159 --> 01:06:57,758
- Look at this.
- I suddenly want to eat it.

2042
01:06:57,759 --> 01:07:01,129
The owner was right when he called it shabu shabu.

2043
01:07:01,699 --> 01:07:03,999
- It looks like shabu shabu.
- Yes.

2044
01:07:04,439 --> 01:07:05,698
- I think there'll be a big twist.
- Listen.

2045
01:07:05,699 --> 01:07:06,868
I think there'll be a big twist.

2046
01:07:06,869 --> 01:07:08,369
There'll be a big twist.

2047
01:07:08,539 --> 01:07:10,978
(The luxurious side dish that comes with the G.S. set)

2048
01:07:10,979 --> 01:07:12,708
- That's it.
- Their backs are straight.

2049
01:07:12,709 --> 01:07:13,978
Hurrah.

2050
01:07:13,979 --> 01:07:15,208
It looks amazing.

2051
01:07:15,209 --> 01:07:16,625
(The dish that calls for rice makes everyone stand up.)

2052
01:07:16,649 --> 01:07:18,448
I want to try one.

2053
01:07:18,449 --> 01:07:19,548
It looks so tasty.

2054
01:07:19,549 --> 01:07:21,265
Can I try soy sauce marinated shrimp first?

2055
01:07:21,289 --> 01:07:23,388
- I like this dish.
- Are there shells?

2056
01:07:23,389 --> 01:07:25,688
- You should peel the shells.
- There are shells.

2057
01:07:25,689 --> 01:07:27,389
I think the shells will come off nicely.

2058
01:07:27,829 --> 01:07:29,529
There we go. I removed the shells.

2059
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:30,698
I'll dip it in soy sauce.

2060
01:07:30,699 --> 01:07:32,099
(Dipping in soy sauce)

2061
01:07:34,129 --> 01:07:35,269
What's different about it?

2062
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:37,498
I'm 100 percent sure that it isn't salty.

2063
01:07:37,499 --> 01:07:38,599
It's nice.

2064
01:07:39,239 --> 01:07:40,308
It's nice.

2065
01:07:40,309 --> 01:07:41,739
How is the saltiness?

2066
01:07:41,939 --> 01:07:44,155
- It isn't salty, right?
- It isn't salty. It tastes clean.

2067
01:07:44,179 --> 01:07:45,848
You can eat it without rice.

2068
01:07:45,849 --> 01:07:47,785
(The saltiness is just right for it to be eaten without rice.)

2069
01:07:47,809 --> 01:07:48,809
(Sang Uk also tries the soy sauce marinated shrimp.)

2070
01:07:48,810 --> 01:07:50,449
It's a nice dish.

2071
01:07:51,149 --> 01:07:52,149
(Impressed)

2072
01:07:52,150 --> 01:07:53,718
- It's tasty, right?
- It's tasty.

2073
01:07:53,719 --> 01:07:54,919
It's tasty.

2074
01:07:55,289 --> 01:07:56,988
It looks so tasty.

2075
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:58,165
(The main dish hasn't appeared yet, but they feel tortured already.)

2076
01:07:58,189 --> 01:07:59,328
How do I do this?

2077
01:07:59,329 --> 01:08:00,728
(He wants to hurry up and eat, but peeling shrimp isn't easy.)

2078
01:08:00,729 --> 01:08:02,528
There has to be a better way.

2079
01:08:02,529 --> 01:08:03,799
To peel shrimp... Hey.

2080
01:08:04,359 --> 01:08:05,458
- It's tasty.
- Like this?

2081
01:08:05,459 --> 01:08:06,798
- Hey.
- Am I doing it right?

2082
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,228
- Take the shrimp...
- Okay.

2083
01:08:08,229 --> 01:08:10,099
- and peel this part.
- Okay.

2084
01:08:10,739 --> 01:08:11,939
Hold it like this...

2085
01:08:12,139 --> 01:08:13,439
and suck on it.

2086
01:08:13,509 --> 01:08:15,209
Hold on a second, Tae Hyun.

2087
01:08:15,769 --> 01:08:17,439
You massaged the shrimp too much.

2088
01:08:17,539 --> 01:08:18,778
Hold on a second.

2089
01:08:18,779 --> 01:08:20,178
- Don't you want it?
- Dip it in soy sauce.

2090
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:21,208
If you don't want it, I can eat it.

2091
01:08:21,209 --> 01:08:22,548
Dip it in soy sauce.

2092
01:08:22,549 --> 01:08:24,518
- Dip it in soy sauce.
- I wiped my hands too.

2093
01:08:24,519 --> 01:08:26,288
Dipping that in soy sauce will be a bit icky.

2094
01:08:26,289 --> 01:08:28,209
- Don't you want it?
- I want it. Give it to me.

2095
01:08:30,119 --> 01:08:31,359
Suck on it.

2096
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:33,229
It's good. It's tasty.

2097
01:08:33,489 --> 01:08:35,829
Hey, this part remains.

2098
01:08:36,059 --> 01:08:37,628
I didn't peel the tail part.

2099
01:08:37,629 --> 01:08:39,629
(He saved some food for himself.)

2100
01:08:39,669 --> 01:08:41,668
That was his intention.

2101
01:08:41,669 --> 01:08:42,939
There's shrimp inside.

2102
01:08:42,969 --> 01:08:44,139
It's tasty.

2103
01:08:45,069 --> 01:08:46,738
- The saltiness is a work of art.
- How is it?

2104
01:08:46,739 --> 01:08:48,419
- Isn't it salty?
- It isn't salty at all.

2105
01:08:48,469 --> 01:08:50,139
- It's tasty. This is it.
- It's perfect.

2106
01:08:51,179 --> 01:08:52,309
This dish...

2107
01:08:54,709 --> 01:08:57,079
- I'll buy some shrimp to go.
- The shrimp dish is tasty.

2108
01:08:57,319 --> 01:08:59,588
I'll be able to eat three bowls of rice with it.

2109
01:08:59,589 --> 01:09:01,589
The soy sauce marinated shrimp is so tasty.

2110
01:09:01,989 --> 01:09:04,089
(Meanwhile, Seung Ho focuses on the beef brisket.)

2111
01:09:19,869 --> 01:09:22,239
- You know...
- Meat is disappearing so quickly.

2112
01:09:24,309 --> 01:09:25,638
When I looked after eating the soy sauce marinated shrimp,

2113
01:09:25,639 --> 01:09:27,008
the meat was gone.

2114
01:09:27,009 --> 01:09:28,048
(The beef brisket is gone.)

2115
01:09:28,049 --> 01:09:29,078
In my case,

2116
01:09:29,079 --> 01:09:30,148
the soy sauce marinated shrimp disappeared.

2117
01:09:30,149 --> 01:09:32,689
(Empty)

2118
01:09:32,889 --> 01:09:34,148
I was so full earlier.

2119
01:09:34,149 --> 01:09:35,488
(Handsome Guys' big eaters eat with gusto...)

2120
01:09:35,489 --> 01:09:36,958
(despite having had a big meal earlier.)

2121
01:09:36,959 --> 01:09:38,988
Isn't this the main dish?

2122
01:09:38,989 --> 01:09:40,058
That's right.

2123
01:09:40,059 --> 01:09:41,559
They're eating the appetizer.

2124
01:09:42,229 --> 01:09:43,398
We'll get it boiling.

2125
01:09:43,399 --> 01:09:44,399
(Tired of waiting, they begin making G.S. for them.)

2126
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:46,268
- I'll add more bok choy.
- Okay.

2127
01:09:46,269 --> 01:09:48,349
(Tired of waiting, they begin making G.S. for them.)

2128
01:09:48,429 --> 01:09:49,738
It's totally like that.

2129
01:09:49,739 --> 01:09:51,068
- We won't complain.
- Let it boil for a while!

2130
01:09:51,069 --> 01:09:52,709
He likes his food rare.

2131
01:09:52,809 --> 01:09:56,409
(Rascal Seung Ho, rare food enthusiast)

2132
01:09:59,148 --> 01:10:00,688
It's totally like that.

2133
01:10:00,721 --> 01:10:02,002
- We won't complain.
- Let it boil for a while!

2134
01:10:02,003 --> 01:10:03,533
He likes his food rare.

2135
01:10:03,703 --> 01:10:07,273
(Rascal Seung Ho, rare food enthusiast)

2136
01:10:09,103 --> 01:10:11,972
- What's this?
- Why? How does it taste?

2137
01:10:11,973 --> 01:10:13,082
It isn't ready yet.

2138
01:10:13,083 --> 01:10:15,343
(It was too soon to try the dish.)

2139
01:10:16,413 --> 01:10:18,283
(Glancing over)

2140
01:10:18,813 --> 01:10:21,653
(Seasoned green onions)

2141
01:10:23,493 --> 01:10:27,362
When we didn't have it earlier...

2142
01:10:27,363 --> 01:10:29,663
- It's tasty.
- It was like...

2143
01:10:30,093 --> 01:10:32,292
the regular shabu shabu broth.

2144
01:10:32,293 --> 01:10:33,463
What are you doing?

2145
01:10:34,333 --> 01:10:35,333
I'm eating it.

2146
01:10:35,334 --> 01:10:37,802
- What? What are you doing?
- It's nothing.

2147
01:10:37,803 --> 01:10:39,942
- What?
- I'm just checking to see...

2148
01:10:39,943 --> 01:10:41,602
if it's okay.

2149
01:10:41,603 --> 01:10:42,672
- Is it okay?
- I wondered if it had gone bad.

2150
01:10:42,673 --> 01:10:43,673
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

2151
01:10:43,674 --> 01:10:44,942
Can you tell if it has gone bad by touching it?

2152
01:10:44,943 --> 01:10:46,912
Well, yes.

2153
01:10:46,913 --> 01:10:47,982
- Yes.
- He checked the pulse.

2154
01:10:47,983 --> 01:10:49,753
I checked the pulse.

2155
01:10:51,683 --> 01:10:53,423
It'll be nice to change the two.

2156
01:10:53,683 --> 01:10:54,853
Shall we ask?

2157
01:10:55,123 --> 01:10:57,893
(How does the G.S. taste now that it's ready to be eaten?)

2158
01:10:58,993 --> 01:11:00,692
(Sang Uk smells the dish first.)

2159
01:11:00,693 --> 01:11:01,892
It's bound to be tasty.

2160
01:11:01,893 --> 01:11:02,963
It's hot!

2161
01:11:03,493 --> 01:11:04,493
(Embarrassed)

2162
01:11:04,494 --> 01:11:06,502
- He was lighting up the stove.
- You timed it perfectly.

2163
01:11:06,503 --> 01:11:07,662
(Why did you have to do it at the same time?)

2164
01:11:07,663 --> 01:11:08,903
For goodness' sake.

2165
01:11:09,703 --> 01:11:12,672
I'll use this to make bibimbap later.

2166
01:11:12,673 --> 01:11:13,702
(The soy sauce will transform into bibimbap.)

2167
01:11:13,703 --> 01:11:15,823
- Tae Hyun wanted the sauce.
- Bibimbap sounds tasty.

2168
01:11:17,013 --> 01:11:18,612
(Soy sauce marinated shrimp bibimbap is coming soon.)

2169
01:11:18,613 --> 01:11:19,613
I'm so hungry.

2170
01:11:20,013 --> 01:11:22,282
- It boiled properly, right?
- Yes, it did.

2171
01:11:22,283 --> 01:11:24,163
(It's time to taste the anticipated dish, G.S.)

2172
01:11:24,653 --> 01:11:26,552
That's how the broth looks...

2173
01:11:26,553 --> 01:11:29,282
when it contains beef.

2174
01:11:29,283 --> 01:11:30,423
It's tasty.

2175
01:11:30,923 --> 01:11:33,623
(Rascal Seung Ho tries the soup that has been boiled down.)

2176
01:11:36,533 --> 01:11:38,573
(They can't wait to hear what Seung Ho has to say.)

2177
01:11:38,693 --> 01:11:39,909
- It became tasty.
- Is it tasty?

2178
01:11:39,933 --> 01:11:41,702
When you had it earlier...

2179
01:11:41,703 --> 01:11:43,932
It's a twist. Seriously.

2180
01:11:43,933 --> 01:11:45,532
It looks like hot pot.

2181
01:11:45,533 --> 01:11:46,573
When you add everything...

2182
01:11:47,103 --> 01:11:49,242
It's spicy. It tastes a bit like...

2183
01:11:49,243 --> 01:11:51,612
- a Thai soup.
- That's right.

2184
01:11:51,613 --> 01:11:54,712
It tastes like the soup of spicy pho.

2185
01:11:54,713 --> 01:11:57,059
That's a bit of the mala aroma, but I don't think it's mala.

2186
01:11:57,083 --> 01:11:58,652
- Seriously.
- The mala aroma.

2187
01:11:58,653 --> 01:12:00,422
- The mala aroma.
- Doesn't it taste like fish stew?

2188
01:12:00,423 --> 01:12:02,123
- It does.
- Right?

2189
01:12:02,753 --> 01:12:03,792
It's also like hot pot.

2190
01:12:03,793 --> 01:12:04,922
(Does it also taste like hot pot?)

2191
01:12:04,923 --> 01:12:08,093
I should've chosen this restaurant for G.S.

2192
01:12:08,523 --> 01:12:10,262
It'll be amazing to have a shot of soju.

2193
01:12:10,263 --> 01:12:11,263
(They can't stop eating the addictive soup.)

2194
01:12:11,264 --> 01:12:13,232
- Is it that good?
- It's perfect for soju.

2195
01:12:13,233 --> 01:12:15,203
(He also tries the meat inside the grilled stew.)

2196
01:12:17,233 --> 01:12:18,473
That's how you eat it.

2197
01:12:18,973 --> 01:12:20,743
(Oh, my!)

2198
01:12:20,843 --> 01:12:22,973
- Should I eat these two together?
- That's right.

2199
01:12:23,143 --> 01:12:24,773
- Like this?
- That's how you eat it.

2200
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,343
Like this? Is this how you eat it?

2201
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:34,723
(My goodness)

2202
01:12:35,823 --> 01:12:36,852
It looks so tasty.

2203
01:12:36,853 --> 01:12:39,662
It's fascinating that this dish is eaten with seasoned green onions.

2204
01:12:39,663 --> 01:12:40,723
How does it taste?

2205
01:12:41,093 --> 01:12:43,092
You usually dip shabu shabu in a sauce.

2206
01:12:43,093 --> 01:12:44,992
Eating the shabu shabu meat and vegetables...

2207
01:12:44,993 --> 01:12:46,153
with seasoned green onions...

2208
01:12:46,533 --> 01:12:48,253
makes me feel like I'm eating grilled meat.

2209
01:12:48,463 --> 01:12:49,932
I thought these two wouldn't go well together.

2210
01:12:49,933 --> 01:12:51,233
How interesting.

2211
01:12:51,633 --> 01:12:53,553
Is that why the dish is called the grilled stew?

2212
01:13:00,913 --> 01:13:02,142
Dong Hyun, it's tasty.

2213
01:13:02,143 --> 01:13:03,652
(It's very tasty.)

2214
01:13:03,653 --> 01:13:06,113
- I don't know how to describe it.
- Seriously.

2215
01:13:06,183 --> 01:13:08,252
I don't know how to describe the taste.

2216
01:13:08,253 --> 01:13:10,522
This dish contains many flavors.

2217
01:13:10,523 --> 01:13:11,592
(Fish stew, pho, hot pot, grilled beef brisket, etc.)

2218
01:13:11,593 --> 01:13:12,922
I can't imagine the taste.

2219
01:13:12,923 --> 01:13:14,339
(The flavor reminds them of various dishes!)

2220
01:13:14,363 --> 01:13:16,463
Aren't you going to eat the acorn jelly?

2221
01:13:16,733 --> 01:13:17,863
We're going to eat it.

2222
01:13:18,393 --> 01:13:20,102
- Why are you so obsessed with it?
- Are you going to eat it?

2223
01:13:20,103 --> 01:13:21,203
I want to try it.

2224
01:13:22,263 --> 01:13:23,902
(Hungry)

2225
01:13:23,903 --> 01:13:25,432
- What?
- What's that?

2226
01:13:25,433 --> 01:13:26,742
(The owner brings something.)

2227
01:13:26,743 --> 01:13:28,802
- With the soy sauce, - The dish we had earlier.

2228
01:13:28,803 --> 01:13:29,842
- I made bibimbap.
- Already?

2229
01:13:29,843 --> 01:13:31,342
(Soy sauce marinated shrimp bibimbap)

2230
01:13:31,343 --> 01:13:32,443
The sauce?

2231
01:13:32,543 --> 01:13:34,713
- May I have a spoonful?
- Go ahead.

2232
01:13:40,823 --> 01:13:42,882
I think it's game over.

2233
01:13:42,883 --> 01:13:44,352
The soy sauce marinated shrimp bibimbap...

2234
01:13:44,353 --> 01:13:46,493
- is bound to be good.
- Anyone would like it.

2235
01:13:46,923 --> 01:13:47,923
It's nice.

2236
01:13:47,924 --> 01:13:49,022
(Impressed)

2237
01:13:49,023 --> 01:13:53,502
This, that, this, that... You could go on forever.

2238
01:13:53,503 --> 01:13:57,902
(G.S., soy sauce marinated shrimp bibimbap)

2239
01:13:57,903 --> 01:14:00,002
You could go on forever.

2240
01:14:00,003 --> 01:14:01,772
You could keep eating them for an hour.

2241
01:14:01,773 --> 01:14:02,802
You could go on forever.

2242
01:14:02,803 --> 01:14:04,613
(An infinite meal)

2243
01:14:09,013 --> 01:14:10,752
Right?

2244
01:14:10,753 --> 01:14:11,812
It can't be helped.

2245
01:14:11,813 --> 01:14:14,122
You'll keep going back and forth between the two dishes.

2246
01:14:14,123 --> 01:14:15,882
The youngest members love it.

2247
01:14:15,883 --> 01:14:17,123
Dong Hyun, hurry up and try it.

2248
01:14:17,793 --> 01:14:20,123
(Curious about the taste, Dong Hyun tries a spoonful.)

2249
01:14:20,663 --> 01:14:21,893
This bibimbap is really tasty.

2250
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,632
(He exclaims nonstop.)

2251
01:14:25,633 --> 01:14:27,933
I want to eat the stew when the savory flavor hits me.

2252
01:14:29,533 --> 01:14:30,533
You could go on forever.

2253
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:32,832
Did he add the guts?

2254
01:14:32,833 --> 01:14:33,842
(They're absorbed in their universe.)

2255
01:14:33,843 --> 01:14:36,242
- This is driving me crazy.
- How does it taste? I'm so curious.

2256
01:14:36,243 --> 01:14:37,342
- I really want to try it.
- Their explanations were lousy.

2257
01:14:37,343 --> 01:14:38,912
- Now, - They're bad at explaining.

2258
01:14:38,913 --> 01:14:39,913
We should have a quiz.

2259
01:14:39,914 --> 01:14:41,212
Seriously,

2260
01:14:41,213 --> 01:14:43,382
someone who has a way with words should eat and describe the taste.

2261
01:14:43,383 --> 01:14:44,383
That's right. Seriously.

2262
01:14:44,384 --> 01:14:46,112
- I'm good at describing the taste.
- Really?

2263
01:14:46,113 --> 01:14:48,582
If you can't describe the taste as well as we want,

2264
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:49,652
there'll be a penalty.

2265
01:14:49,653 --> 01:14:50,722
It's a low kick.

2266
01:14:50,723 --> 01:14:51,852
(Kim Dong Hyun's low kick)

2267
01:14:51,853 --> 01:14:53,362
- Seriously.
- It's too much.

2268
01:14:53,363 --> 01:14:54,463
You just need to do well.

2269
01:14:54,693 --> 01:14:57,132
If the production crew listens to my description...

2270
01:14:57,133 --> 01:14:59,432
and connects to it,

2271
01:14:59,433 --> 01:15:00,963
I'll give you a noogie.

2272
01:15:01,803 --> 01:15:02,862
- A noogie?
- Yes.

2273
01:15:02,863 --> 01:15:05,703
Why would I say yes when there's nothing to gain?

2274
01:15:05,973 --> 01:15:07,402
- Let's do this.
- I...

2275
01:15:07,403 --> 01:15:08,802
If they don't connect to it,

2276
01:15:08,803 --> 01:15:10,142
I'll take a low kick.

2277
01:15:10,143 --> 01:15:11,712
- Okay.
- They're neck-and-neck.

2278
01:15:11,713 --> 01:15:13,012
- May I try it then?
- Yes.

2279
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:14,042
Okay.

2280
01:15:14,043 --> 01:15:15,382
We're just frustrated.

2281
01:15:15,383 --> 01:15:17,652
- Try this and the soup.
- I'm curious about the taste.

2282
01:15:17,653 --> 01:15:19,383
- I'll try it.
- Seriously.

2283
01:15:21,083 --> 01:15:23,522
- It's tasty, but...
- It's tasty, but new.

2284
01:15:23,523 --> 01:15:25,804
- I don't know how to describe it.
- It's tasty, but new.

2285
01:15:28,963 --> 01:15:29,963
How is it?

2286
01:15:29,964 --> 01:15:31,032
(Swirling)

2287
01:15:31,033 --> 01:15:32,393
(Choking)

2288
01:15:33,703 --> 01:15:35,543
He's savoring the taste with his entire mouth.

2289
01:15:36,933 --> 01:15:37,933
How is it?

2290
01:15:38,833 --> 01:15:39,842
(How will Daniel describe the taste?)

2291
01:15:39,843 --> 01:15:40,843
How is it?

2292
01:15:41,303 --> 01:15:42,443
How will you describe it?

2293
01:15:44,713 --> 01:15:45,843
Firstly, it's spicy.

2294
01:15:46,483 --> 01:15:47,483
(Firstly, let's get up.)

2295
01:15:47,484 --> 01:15:49,142
Hold on.

2296
01:15:49,143 --> 01:15:51,382
- Let me try the meat.
- Go ahead.

2297
01:15:51,383 --> 01:15:52,912
Don't be like that, Dong Hyun!

2298
01:15:52,913 --> 01:15:55,083
I was just getting started.

2299
01:15:55,623 --> 01:15:56,692
I'm just getting ready.

2300
01:15:56,693 --> 01:15:59,152
I'll be too scared to say anything.

2301
01:15:59,153 --> 01:16:00,922
- Please respect me.
- I think...

2302
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:02,263
he got some food for a low kick.

2303
01:16:02,923 --> 01:16:05,792
The taste is a bit mysterious.

2304
01:16:05,793 --> 01:16:07,232
How does it taste?

2305
01:16:07,233 --> 01:16:09,462
You know, it's a familiar taste.

2306
01:16:09,463 --> 01:16:11,532
- All right.
- I can't wait to hear his words.

2307
01:16:11,533 --> 01:16:12,973
It's tasty. It's really tasty.

2308
01:16:13,003 --> 01:16:14,043
There are...

2309
01:16:14,673 --> 01:16:15,903
no words for it.

2310
01:16:17,443 --> 01:16:19,012
He has delivered so many lines,

2311
01:16:19,013 --> 01:16:20,733
so he must be good at describing the taste.

2312
01:16:22,113 --> 01:16:23,713
His description must be deep.

2313
01:16:24,653 --> 01:16:25,653
Let's hear it.

2314
01:16:27,383 --> 01:16:28,453
How does it taste?

2315
01:16:29,153 --> 01:16:31,292
Spicy? It's spicy.

2316
01:16:31,293 --> 01:16:32,393
You'll need to get kicked.

2317
01:16:33,423 --> 01:16:35,063
By any chance, do you want to get kicked?

2318
01:16:36,893 --> 01:16:38,193
I'm in tears already.

2319
01:16:38,293 --> 01:16:40,362
I'm scared of getting kicked.

2320
01:16:40,363 --> 01:16:41,962
(Getting up)

2321
01:16:41,963 --> 01:16:43,332
Dong Hyun, where are you going?

2322
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:45,453
Dong Hyun, I'm not done yet. Give me a bit more time.

2323
01:16:48,073 --> 01:16:50,443
The spiciness...

2324
01:16:50,713 --> 01:16:53,242
and the flavor of the meat enter the mouth.

2325
01:16:53,243 --> 01:16:56,112
Then suddenly, seasoned green onions take over.

2326
01:16:56,113 --> 01:17:00,283
Since he can see the meat, he goes, "The flavor of the meat."

2327
01:17:00,483 --> 01:17:04,022
"Seasoned green onions take over."

2328
01:17:04,023 --> 01:17:05,322
Seriously.

2329
01:17:05,323 --> 01:17:06,323
(He described the taste according to what he saw.)

2330
01:17:06,324 --> 01:17:08,292
If his description made you imagine the taste,

2331
01:17:08,293 --> 01:17:11,292
please clap your hands.

2332
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:12,773
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2333
01:17:13,303 --> 01:17:17,472
- Come on out.
- This is just wrong.

2334
01:17:17,473 --> 01:17:18,672
Dong Hyun, hold on.

2335
01:17:18,673 --> 01:17:20,873
This makes no sense.

2336
01:17:20,973 --> 01:17:22,673
How is it that no one clapped?

2337
01:17:23,613 --> 01:17:25,873
I'm sure none of the viewers clapped.

2338
01:17:25,943 --> 01:17:27,312
It's better if you keep your eyes closed.

2339
01:17:27,313 --> 01:17:28,342
- That's right.
- Should he close his eyes?

2340
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:30,112
- Close your eyes and be at ease.
- No, I won't close them.

2341
01:17:30,113 --> 01:17:31,113
From here...

2342
01:17:31,453 --> 01:17:32,712
- I haven't done anything.
- Tell me when you'll do it.

2343
01:17:32,713 --> 01:17:33,882
- I'll do it.
- Will you do it now?

2344
01:17:33,883 --> 01:17:34,983
Yes. I'll do it.

2345
01:17:35,823 --> 01:17:37,453
- Please, Dong Hyun.
- Here I go.

2346
01:17:39,093 --> 01:17:40,223
Here I go.

2347
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:42,363
(Screaming)

2348
01:17:42,523 --> 01:17:44,463
(Trembling)

2349
01:17:47,003 --> 01:17:51,003
(Kicking the leg)

2350
01:17:52,973 --> 01:17:55,503
It's no joke.

2351
01:17:56,743 --> 01:17:58,812
- Really?
- I kicked gently.

2352
01:17:58,813 --> 01:17:59,813
How bad is the pain?

2353
01:17:59,814 --> 01:18:00,974
(Using an elegant expression)

2354
01:18:02,983 --> 01:18:06,113
(He described his pain better than the taste.)

2355
01:18:06,413 --> 01:18:09,382
- I think I know.
- It hurts so much.

2356
01:18:09,383 --> 01:18:12,122
Seriously, it wasn't as bad as the kick Pani Bottle got.

2357
01:18:12,123 --> 01:18:13,723
- That's right.
- It was much weaker.

2358
01:18:13,863 --> 01:18:14,863
(Dazed)

2359
01:18:14,864 --> 01:18:15,923
It hurt so much.

2360
01:18:16,293 --> 01:18:18,613
Do you want to try the acorn jelly and describe the taste?

2361
01:18:19,063 --> 01:18:20,502
No? Don't you want it?

2362
01:18:20,503 --> 01:18:22,362
- I don't want it. It's okay.
- Won't you describe the taste?

2363
01:18:22,363 --> 01:18:24,602
We fixed this rascal's bad habit.

2364
01:18:24,603 --> 01:18:25,903
You could describe the taste.

2365
01:18:26,203 --> 01:18:28,002
That's right. That's how you fix a rascal's bad habit.

2366
01:18:28,003 --> 01:18:29,003
His bad habit got fixed.

2367
01:18:29,004 --> 01:18:31,713
- One person got fixed.
- It was no joke.

2368
01:18:32,043 --> 01:18:35,012
Is there anyone who can describe the taste properly?

2369
01:18:35,013 --> 01:18:37,093
- Dong Hyun, he wants to do it.
- You should try it.

2370
01:18:37,353 --> 01:18:39,212
- Go ahead.
- Will there be a low kick?

2371
01:18:39,213 --> 01:18:40,552
- No. Just eat it.
- Really?

2372
01:18:40,553 --> 01:18:41,583
Come on, Dong Hyun!

2373
01:18:43,453 --> 01:18:44,692
(Very upset)

2374
01:18:44,693 --> 01:18:45,992
Because of my contract,

2375
01:18:45,993 --> 01:18:48,263
I can only do one low kick a day on TV.

2376
01:18:48,563 --> 01:18:50,662
It's too violent to do two low kicks a day.

2377
01:18:50,663 --> 01:18:51,663
So I'm done for today.

2378
01:18:51,664 --> 01:18:53,302
You should've checked the contract.

2379
01:18:53,303 --> 01:18:54,632
- One MMA technique a day.
- You haven't checked it.

2380
01:18:54,633 --> 01:18:55,832
It's in the contract.

2381
01:18:55,833 --> 01:18:56,902
- You haven't checked it.
- Right. It can be dangerous.

2382
01:18:56,903 --> 01:18:58,273
Yes. It can be dangerous.

2383
01:18:58,473 --> 01:19:01,603
(He starts trying the food without worrying about low kicks.)

2384
01:19:07,113 --> 01:19:08,633
- Give it a try.
- You're just eating.

2385
01:19:08,743 --> 01:19:11,013
Why won't you hit him, Dong Hyun?

2386
01:19:11,713 --> 01:19:12,912
I can hit him past midnight,

2387
01:19:12,913 --> 01:19:14,393
but it hasn't gone past midnight yet.

2388
01:19:14,423 --> 01:19:15,983
That is why.

2389
01:19:17,593 --> 01:19:19,022
How does it taste, Yi Kyung?

2390
01:19:19,023 --> 01:19:20,539
(How will Yi Kyung describe its taste?)

2391
01:19:20,563 --> 01:19:22,363
- This is surely a shabu shabu.
- Right.

2392
01:19:23,163 --> 01:19:24,362
Sang Uk mentioned the fish stew.

2393
01:19:24,363 --> 01:19:26,039
Dong Hyun mentioned the grease from the meat.

2394
01:19:26,063 --> 01:19:27,703
Also, with its spiciness,

2395
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:30,073
you can taste...

2396
01:19:30,533 --> 01:19:32,433
the Korean version of the shabu shabu here.

2397
01:19:32,833 --> 01:19:34,249
The Korean version of the shabu shabu.

2398
01:19:34,273 --> 01:19:35,742
- The Korean version.
- My gosh.

2399
01:19:35,743 --> 01:19:37,303
How is that a description of the taste?

2400
01:19:37,373 --> 01:19:38,843
Are you describing its origin?

2401
01:19:39,073 --> 01:19:40,082
Hold on.

2402
01:19:40,083 --> 01:19:42,412
Let's hear from the staff members with their clapping.

2403
01:19:42,413 --> 01:19:44,852
Clap if he did a good job. Don't clap if he didn't.

2404
01:19:44,853 --> 01:19:46,683
All right. One, two, three.

2405
01:19:47,223 --> 01:19:52,193
(Clapping)

2406
01:19:52,993 --> 01:19:54,823
You have to get hit if they clap.

2407
01:19:55,463 --> 01:19:56,492
Come out.

2408
01:19:56,493 --> 01:19:57,762
It's 12:01am, Dong Hyun.

2409
01:19:57,763 --> 01:19:59,092
- Oh, right.
- It's 12:01am.

2410
01:19:59,093 --> 01:20:00,702
It just happened to be past midnight.

2411
01:20:00,703 --> 01:20:01,762
(It just happened to be past midnight.)

2412
01:20:01,763 --> 01:20:03,132
I am never going to be on this show again.

2413
01:20:03,133 --> 01:20:05,433
Don't you dare invite me again.

2414
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:07,513
You all are hand in glove with each other.

2415
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:09,603
What was the best variety show for you again?

2416
01:20:09,903 --> 01:20:11,043
I don't know!

2417
01:20:11,813 --> 01:20:12,873
I feel so annoyed!

2418
01:20:14,013 --> 01:20:16,412
He paid last time and he got hit this time.

2419
01:20:16,413 --> 01:20:17,512
This is the worst show.

2420
01:20:17,513 --> 01:20:18,913
(Handsome Guys is the worst show.)

2421
01:20:19,453 --> 01:20:20,883
Excuse me.

2422
01:20:21,683 --> 01:20:22,683
I'm asking this in a serious manner.

2423
01:20:22,684 --> 01:20:23,693
- Right.
- Right.

2424
01:20:24,793 --> 01:20:26,052
Are you going to have the acorn jelly?

2425
01:20:26,053 --> 01:20:28,122
(Are you going to have the acorn jelly?)

2426
01:20:28,123 --> 01:20:30,003
You said you were going to have it a while ago.

2427
01:20:30,493 --> 01:20:32,262
- With that much tenacity...
- Just give it to him.

2428
01:20:32,263 --> 01:20:33,832
With that much tenacity, you should be given some.

2429
01:20:33,833 --> 01:20:34,962
Is there a special story behind this?

2430
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:36,833
No. I just love acorn jelly.

2431
01:20:36,933 --> 01:20:38,502
- I'll try it.
- Don't worry about it.

2432
01:20:38,503 --> 01:20:40,583
(He barely manages to try the precious acorn jelly.)

2433
01:20:44,143 --> 01:20:45,773
Please describe its taste for us.

2434
01:20:46,143 --> 01:20:47,443
- Gosh.
- You should be careful.

2435
01:20:48,083 --> 01:20:49,712
I'll really poke you.

2436
01:20:49,713 --> 01:20:51,012
If it's about poking, you should step up.

2437
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:52,253
Is it my turn now?

2438
01:20:52,913 --> 01:20:53,923
All right.

2439
01:20:55,253 --> 01:20:58,993
- He's a specialist with that.
- Right.

2440
01:20:59,623 --> 01:21:00,723
It's good.

2441
01:21:01,423 --> 01:21:03,763
- The total is 141 dollars.
- It's 141 dollars?

2442
01:21:04,063 --> 01:21:06,032
- Get out your cards.
- Shall we?

2443
01:21:06,033 --> 01:21:07,103
- Right.
- All right.

2444
01:21:07,803 --> 01:21:09,503
- Oh, gosh.
- What?

2445
01:21:09,703 --> 01:21:11,343
He's really sensitive about these things.

2446
01:21:11,773 --> 01:21:13,673
- It just stuck to the floor.
- Gosh.

2447
01:21:14,043 --> 01:21:15,642
- That feels ominous.
- Dong Hyun's card fell.

2448
01:21:15,643 --> 01:21:16,702
No. It stuck to the floor.

2449
01:21:16,703 --> 01:21:18,843
- It will be Dong Hyun.
- Flat on the floor.

2450
01:21:18,943 --> 01:21:20,383
Bad luck has come to him.

2451
01:21:20,443 --> 01:21:21,712
(He takes Sang Uk's card.)

2452
01:21:21,713 --> 01:21:22,882
- No.
- Gosh!

2453
01:21:22,883 --> 01:21:25,082
I'm sorry.

2454
01:21:25,083 --> 01:21:27,683
- What a bully.
- I'm sorry.

2455
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:29,782
- I got so surprised.
- I have to do it again.

2456
01:21:29,783 --> 01:21:31,053
- I have my routine.
- Gosh.

2457
01:21:32,223 --> 01:21:33,592
I even brush my teeth again in the morning...

2458
01:21:33,593 --> 01:21:34,762
when my routine goes wrong.

2459
01:21:34,763 --> 01:21:35,792
A card switch? Gosh.

2460
01:21:35,793 --> 01:21:37,532
Like this. I'll put it back in.

2461
01:21:37,533 --> 01:21:38,692
It's an intense war of nerves.

2462
01:21:38,693 --> 01:21:40,503
After that, I will flip it once.

2463
01:21:40,803 --> 01:21:41,962
Do you have to go that far?

2464
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:43,203
I won with this card.

2465
01:21:44,503 --> 01:21:45,632
(It's time for the quiz to decide on the payer of 141 dollars.)

2466
01:21:45,633 --> 01:21:46,979
- Let's go.
- You won with that card?

2467
01:21:47,003 --> 01:21:48,143
- Shall we start?
- Yes.

2468
01:21:48,303 --> 01:21:49,973
- Please get the panel first.
- Okay.

2469
01:21:53,513 --> 01:21:54,543
I know this pig.

2470
01:21:54,813 --> 01:21:56,613
It's the painting pig. The genius pig.

2471
01:21:57,253 --> 01:21:58,353
It's something he knows.

2472
01:21:58,713 --> 01:22:03,122
In South Africa, a pig was active as a painter...

2473
01:22:03,123 --> 01:22:04,892
- and gained a lot of popularity.
- I've heard about it.

2474
01:22:04,893 --> 01:22:05,893
- You've heard about it, right?
- Yes.

2475
01:22:05,894 --> 01:22:08,123
- There's a painting pig?
- There's such a pig?

2476
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:10,662
This painting that was drawn by the pig painter...

2477
01:22:10,663 --> 01:22:12,762
is called "Wild and Free."

2478
01:22:12,763 --> 01:22:14,332
A German investor...

2479
01:22:14,333 --> 01:22:16,763
bought it for 31,000 dollars.

2480
01:22:17,233 --> 01:22:18,872
- It was bought for 31,000 dollars?
- It was bought for 31,000 dollars?

2481
01:22:18,873 --> 01:22:21,302
This is the most expensive selling price...

2482
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:22,673
for a painting drawn by an animal.

2483
01:22:23,273 --> 01:22:27,442
Then what is the name of this pig painter?

2484
01:22:27,443 --> 01:22:28,542
Gosh!

2485
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:30,852
Then what is the name of this pig painter?

2486
01:22:30,853 --> 01:22:31,853
My gosh!

2487
01:22:31,854 --> 01:22:34,352
- The pig has a name?
- Isn't that too personal?

2488
01:22:34,353 --> 01:22:35,582
How will they guess its name?

2489
01:22:35,583 --> 01:22:37,452
- We have to guess its name?
- Yes.

2490
01:22:37,453 --> 01:22:38,693
(We have to guess its name?)

2491
01:22:39,023 --> 01:22:40,053
Come on!

2492
01:22:40,763 --> 01:22:42,092
- Time out.
- Out of all the questions...

2493
01:22:42,093 --> 01:22:43,322
Hold on.

2494
01:22:43,323 --> 01:22:44,692
We can't even make guesses.

2495
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:47,503
Is there a way they can guess its name?

2496
01:22:48,633 --> 01:22:50,003
- Bob.
- What?

2497
01:22:50,773 --> 01:22:52,013
- Bob Ross!
- That makes sense.

2498
01:22:52,273 --> 01:22:53,942
- The man that said, "That's easy." - Right.

2499
01:22:53,943 --> 01:22:55,442
(Bob is a well-known painter.)

2500
01:22:55,443 --> 01:22:57,643
- We should still decide on it.
- I just called it out.

2501
01:22:57,943 --> 01:23:01,082
We should bring out all of the painters that we know of.

2502
01:23:01,083 --> 01:23:02,483
What are some names of painters?

2503
01:23:03,183 --> 01:23:04,582
There's Picasso.

2504
01:23:04,583 --> 01:23:06,952
I don't know many painters. Leonardo da Vinci.

2505
01:23:06,953 --> 01:23:08,023
Beethoven?

2506
01:23:08,283 --> 01:23:10,293
Pig Gogh. No.

2507
01:23:10,593 --> 01:23:11,593
Nam June Paik?

2508
01:23:11,753 --> 01:23:13,293
Pignardo da Vinci.

2509
01:23:14,263 --> 01:23:16,499
- Isn't it something like that?
- Let's write that down.

2510
01:23:16,523 --> 01:23:17,793
That sounds like the answer.

2511
01:23:18,063 --> 01:23:19,292
Pignardo da Vinci.

2512
01:23:19,293 --> 01:23:20,932
Pigsso?

2513
01:23:20,933 --> 01:23:22,132
(Picasso plus pig, Pigsso?)

2514
01:23:22,133 --> 01:23:24,402
I think Pigsso is a good shout.

2515
01:23:24,403 --> 01:23:26,603
We might have to prepare for the quiz.

2516
01:23:26,703 --> 01:23:30,003
But in my memory, I remember it to be Picasso.

2517
01:23:30,243 --> 01:23:31,373
Just Picasso?

2518
01:23:31,873 --> 01:23:33,413
I remember seeing Picasso.

2519
01:23:33,513 --> 01:23:34,642
- Picasso? Not Pigsso?
- Right.

2520
01:23:34,643 --> 01:23:36,382
I guess there was something else to it.

2521
01:23:36,383 --> 01:23:37,383
(Remembering it faintly)

2522
01:23:37,384 --> 01:23:38,904
- Isn't that the original name?
- Yes.

2523
01:23:39,153 --> 01:23:42,223
Isn't it Pigcasso as it's mixed with Picasso?

2524
01:23:42,683 --> 01:23:44,653
- Pigcasso?
- Pig?

2525
01:23:44,893 --> 01:23:45,952
(Pigcasso?)

2526
01:23:45,953 --> 01:23:47,723
It's Pigcasso...

2527
01:23:48,463 --> 01:23:50,223
written like this.

2528
01:23:50,893 --> 01:23:52,763
(The answer was given out by mistake?)

2529
01:23:53,063 --> 01:23:54,162
(Whispering)

2530
01:23:54,163 --> 01:23:55,302
- Precisely.
- All right. We got it.

2531
01:23:55,303 --> 01:23:56,303
Okay.

2532
01:23:56,304 --> 01:23:57,402
- We'll call out the answer.
- Be precise.

2533
01:23:57,403 --> 01:23:58,702
- Two, three.
- Two, three.

2534
01:23:58,703 --> 01:23:59,732
- Pigcasso.
- Pigcasso.

2535
01:23:59,733 --> 01:24:03,842
(Blurred)

2536
01:24:03,843 --> 01:24:05,373
That's cheating!

2537
01:24:06,243 --> 01:24:08,183
- We were precise.
- They have great teamwork.

2538
01:24:08,413 --> 01:24:09,743
- Gosh.
- Be precise.

2539
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:12,753
I have to remember its name, but I can't.

2540
01:24:12,813 --> 01:24:15,353
I'll just trust the two of you.

2541
01:24:16,283 --> 01:24:18,322
I think it's Picasso or Pigsso.

2542
01:24:18,323 --> 01:24:19,323
- Really?
- I'm leaning toward those names.

2543
01:24:19,324 --> 01:24:20,593
Now that I think about it,

2544
01:24:21,093 --> 01:24:24,732
adding "Pig" to "Picasso" to make it "Pigsso..."

2545
01:24:24,733 --> 01:24:26,132
is a Korean thing to do.

2546
01:24:26,133 --> 01:24:27,202
Right.

2547
01:24:27,203 --> 01:24:29,563
I don't think names would be made like that abroad.

2548
01:24:29,763 --> 01:24:30,833
Right.

2549
01:24:31,003 --> 01:24:33,003
It would just have been named Picasso.

2550
01:24:33,303 --> 01:24:35,043
- Picasso.
- Okay. Let's go with that.

2551
01:24:35,343 --> 01:24:36,643
- Picasso.
- We got it.

2552
01:24:36,903 --> 01:24:38,143
One, two, three.

2553
01:24:38,273 --> 01:24:39,273
- Picasso.
- Picasso.

2554
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:40,942
Picasso just like the artist's name?

2555
01:24:40,943 --> 01:24:42,742
- Yes.
- This is a hard one.

2556
01:24:42,743 --> 01:24:44,012
We will have the least regrets with this answer...

2557
01:24:44,013 --> 01:24:45,282
- even if we get it wrong.
- Right.

2558
01:24:45,283 --> 01:24:46,652
What if it's Pigsso?

2559
01:24:46,653 --> 01:24:47,882
(Answer: Picasso)

2560
01:24:47,883 --> 01:24:49,023
That is incorrect.

2561
01:24:51,123 --> 01:24:52,353
I got it! Pigsso.

2562
01:24:52,953 --> 01:24:54,122
Are you answering right away?

2563
01:24:54,123 --> 01:24:56,193
- Pigsso.
- Pigasso.

2564
01:24:56,893 --> 01:24:59,093
- Pigasso?
- Pigsso.

2565
01:24:59,333 --> 01:25:01,562
- What are you doing?
- Please be precise.

2566
01:25:01,563 --> 01:25:02,663
Pigasso.

2567
01:25:03,233 --> 01:25:05,033
- Incorrect.
- I got it. Leonardo.

2568
01:25:05,873 --> 01:25:06,873
(All of a sudden?)

2569
01:25:06,874 --> 01:25:08,102
All of a sudden?

2570
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,403
- That was nice.
- Leonardo!

2571
01:25:09,573 --> 01:25:10,643
- Incorrect.
- I got it.

2572
01:25:10,873 --> 01:25:12,513
- Pigsso.
- That must be it.

2573
01:25:12,873 --> 01:25:13,983
- Is it right?
- Incorrect.

2574
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:16,443
- What?
- Pigcasso.

2575
01:25:16,713 --> 01:25:17,713
Pigcasso?

2576
01:25:17,714 --> 01:25:19,152
(Pig plus Casso, Pigcasso)

2577
01:25:19,153 --> 01:25:20,183
Correct.

2578
01:25:20,553 --> 01:25:22,883
- Gosh!
- We got it right!

2579
01:25:23,483 --> 01:25:26,252
(The answer was mentioned by Team Hof.)

2580
01:25:26,253 --> 01:25:28,193
- It was actually Pigcasso.
- Okay.

2581
01:25:28,463 --> 01:25:30,163
This is the quiz for the two of you.

2582
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:31,932
- We'll begin.
- Okay.

2583
01:25:31,933 --> 01:25:35,203
The original name of "dolphin" in Pure Korean in "water pig."

2584
01:25:35,433 --> 01:25:36,433
- What?
- Water pig?

2585
01:25:36,434 --> 01:25:38,332
The protruding mouth of the dolphin...

2586
01:25:38,333 --> 01:25:39,502
looked like the pig's nose...

2587
01:25:39,503 --> 01:25:40,919
and that was why that name was given.

2588
01:25:40,943 --> 01:25:43,712
Like so, the names of animals in Pure Korean...

2589
01:25:43,713 --> 01:25:47,583
were based on the characteristics and appearances of each animal.

2590
01:25:47,783 --> 01:25:49,543
I see. This one will be easy.

2591
01:25:50,083 --> 01:25:51,383
Then out of the following,

2592
01:25:51,583 --> 01:25:54,883
which one is not the Pure Korean name of an animal?

2593
01:25:55,053 --> 01:25:57,252
There's 1 out of 4 that's not a Pure Korean name? Okay.

2594
01:25:57,253 --> 01:25:58,253
Rock-paper-scissors.

2595
01:25:58,593 --> 01:26:00,792
- Seung Ho will go first.
- I can choose first.

2596
01:26:00,793 --> 01:26:01,862
- Right.
- Right.

2597
01:26:01,863 --> 01:26:04,433
Number one, the hippo. Water fatso.

2598
01:26:04,593 --> 01:26:05,762
I think that's its name.

2599
01:26:05,763 --> 01:26:09,863
Number two, the killer whale. White-lined water pig.

2600
01:26:10,103 --> 01:26:13,903
Number three, the Welsh Corgi. Wales Cutie.

2601
01:26:14,103 --> 01:26:16,173
- That sounds off.
- Number four, the koala.

2602
01:26:16,443 --> 01:26:18,113
Big nose pocket bear.

2603
01:26:18,443 --> 01:26:21,013
- Does the koala have a pocket?
- The koala?

2604
01:26:21,183 --> 01:26:23,042
- This is really hard.
- Right.

2605
01:26:23,043 --> 01:26:24,152
With what I know,

2606
01:26:24,153 --> 01:26:26,053
the Welsh Corgi was a hunting dog.

2607
01:26:26,313 --> 01:26:27,452
- I see.
- It was a hunting dog.

2608
01:26:27,453 --> 01:26:30,953
Also, the koala doesn't have a pocket.

2609
01:26:31,453 --> 01:26:32,822
Which one do you want to go with?

2610
01:26:32,823 --> 01:26:33,823
(Which one do you want to go with?)

2611
01:26:33,824 --> 01:26:36,092
(Water fatso, white-lined water pig, Wales cutie, big nose pocket bear)

2612
01:26:36,093 --> 01:26:37,793
- Be honest.
- Why?

2613
01:26:38,533 --> 01:26:40,853
- Why are you acting so cute?
- I think I know the answer.

2614
01:26:41,003 --> 01:26:42,232
"Why?"

2615
01:26:42,233 --> 01:26:44,573
I think I know the answer.

2616
01:26:44,903 --> 01:26:46,032
I want to go with number one.

2617
01:26:46,033 --> 01:26:47,672
(I'll say it's number 1.)

2618
01:26:47,673 --> 01:26:48,972
(Water fatso, white-lined water pig, Wales cutie, big nose pocket bear)

2619
01:26:48,973 --> 01:26:50,713
Number one. That one sounds off.

2620
01:26:51,713 --> 01:26:53,012
Hippos are so strong. Why call them fatsos?

2621
01:26:53,013 --> 01:26:54,443
- They're so strong.
- Gosh.

2622
01:26:54,813 --> 01:26:56,573
Did you decide? Will you give me the chance?

2623
01:26:56,943 --> 01:26:58,612
- Hold on.
- Will you?

2624
01:26:58,613 --> 01:26:59,812
- Water fatso, - Will you?

2625
01:26:59,813 --> 01:27:00,823
White-lined water pig,

2626
01:27:00,953 --> 01:27:02,382
- Wales cutie...
- I do want to go with number one.

2627
01:27:02,383 --> 01:27:03,452
(He's making it obvious that he's pretending he wants number 1.)

2628
01:27:03,453 --> 01:27:05,253
I'll just go with number four.

2629
01:27:05,353 --> 01:27:06,852
I was going to go with number four too.

2630
01:27:06,853 --> 01:27:08,322
(I was going to go with number 4 too.)

2631
01:27:08,323 --> 01:27:11,333
But I think it's a 50-50 chance.

2632
01:27:11,633 --> 01:27:12,833
Should we switch then?

2633
01:27:13,063 --> 01:27:14,133
No.

2634
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:16,639
- I'll go with number 3.
- You will go with number 3.

2635
01:27:16,663 --> 01:27:17,672
I have no choice.

2636
01:27:17,673 --> 01:27:19,532
- Welsh Corgi or koala.
- The answer is...

2637
01:27:19,533 --> 01:27:20,672
(Who has chosen the animal with the incorrect name?)

2638
01:27:20,673 --> 01:27:21,843
number four, the koala.

2639
01:27:22,503 --> 01:27:24,172
(Seung Ho gets exempted from paying.)

2640
01:27:24,173 --> 01:27:25,933
- That's the incorrect name, right?
- Right.

2641
01:27:26,373 --> 01:27:27,512
Gosh!

2642
01:27:27,513 --> 01:27:29,482
(Dong Hyun is the one to pay 141 dollars.)

2643
01:27:29,483 --> 01:27:30,912
I thought I was doing well these days.

2644
01:27:30,913 --> 01:27:32,182
There's a 90 percent chance now.

2645
01:27:32,183 --> 01:27:33,682
- There's a 90 percent chance.
- Please get caught more often.

2646
01:27:33,683 --> 01:27:35,243
- Please enter your signature.
- Right.

2647
01:27:36,123 --> 01:27:37,992
- Gosh, thank you.
- Thank you.

2648
01:27:37,993 --> 01:27:39,233
(Receipt: Total of 141 dollars)

2649
01:27:39,453 --> 01:27:43,422
(It has become dark at Daehak-ro after enjoying the G.S.)

2650
01:27:43,423 --> 01:27:44,463
Let's go.

2651
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:46,032
(The summer rain that will bring down the heat falls too.)

2652
01:27:46,033 --> 01:27:47,233
It's raining slightly.

2653
01:27:47,433 --> 01:27:50,033
(Where will they move to in the rain?)

2654
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:53,202
(Daehak-ro Menu Recommendation, Act 4)

2655
01:27:53,203 --> 01:27:56,403
(DMR 2: Hof)

2656
01:27:56,843 --> 01:27:57,943
Gosh, it's refreshing.

2657
01:27:58,543 --> 01:28:01,183
- I want to be under the rain.
- It's great at night at Daehak-ro.

2658
01:28:01,243 --> 01:28:02,882
I've been here often.

2659
01:28:02,883 --> 01:28:04,282
(Daniel has fallen for the romantic night vibes.)

2660
01:28:04,283 --> 01:28:05,753
This is great.

2661
01:28:06,413 --> 01:28:08,353
- What? It's Kim Dong Hyun!
- Gosh.

2662
01:28:08,753 --> 01:28:10,182
Everyone loves him.

2663
01:28:10,183 --> 01:28:11,793
- He's so popular.
- He's from Daejeon!

2664
01:28:11,853 --> 01:28:13,192
- Oh, Daejeon!
- He's from Daejeon.

2665
01:28:13,193 --> 01:28:14,662
I'm from Daejeon too.

2666
01:28:14,663 --> 01:28:15,893
I'm from Daejeon too.

2667
01:28:16,223 --> 01:28:18,363
The pride of Daejeon, Oh Sang Uk.

2668
01:28:18,633 --> 01:28:20,132
It's been so long.

2669
01:28:20,133 --> 01:28:21,362
(They have reached their destination after walking through Daehak-ro.)

2670
01:28:21,363 --> 01:28:23,633
What? Is it this place?

2671
01:28:24,033 --> 01:28:25,549
- Is it this place?
- It's this place.

2672
01:28:25,573 --> 01:28:26,973
- I see.
- What is this?

2673
01:28:27,243 --> 01:28:28,843
- Look at the parasol.
- 2006?

2674
01:28:29,273 --> 01:28:30,442
- Look at the parasol up there.
- Daniel!

2675
01:28:30,443 --> 01:28:33,112
(The parasol welcomes the Handsome Guys.)

2676
01:28:33,113 --> 01:28:34,243
- Daniel!
- Yes?

2677
01:28:34,613 --> 01:28:35,883
It's the best pizza place?

2678
01:28:37,113 --> 01:28:38,182
Nice!

2679
01:28:38,183 --> 01:28:40,082
(Delighted)

2680
01:28:40,083 --> 01:28:41,183
I love it!

2681
01:28:41,883 --> 01:28:43,253
Pizza at a hof?

2682
01:28:43,453 --> 01:28:44,453
Tae Hyun!

2683
01:28:44,723 --> 01:28:46,522
A place with great draft beer!

2684
01:28:46,523 --> 01:28:49,363
(Too much drinking can be bad for your health.)

2685
01:28:49,563 --> 01:28:51,083
Gosh, the entrance feels so welcoming.

2686
01:28:51,233 --> 01:28:53,693
This is a true hof in the Daehak-ro area.

2687
01:28:55,303 --> 01:28:56,502
(Vibes that can be felt right from the entrance)

2688
01:28:56,503 --> 01:28:57,933
Look at the posters.

2689
01:29:00,073 --> 01:29:01,402
What is this place?

2690
01:29:01,403 --> 01:29:03,342
(The posters on the wall are like the wallpaper.)

2691
01:29:03,343 --> 01:29:04,513
It's vintage.

2692
01:29:04,973 --> 01:29:07,143
It feels like entering a vintage shop.

2693
01:29:08,013 --> 01:29:10,413
There are all of the actors from Daehak-ro.

2694
01:29:12,653 --> 01:29:16,823
(A place filled with cost-effective dishes...)

2695
01:29:17,353 --> 01:29:18,652
(and a famous hideout for many Daehak-ro actors and fans)

2696
01:29:18,653 --> 01:29:21,492
I was led here by my seniors...

2697
01:29:21,493 --> 01:29:23,223
and came here often for get-togethers.

2698
01:29:23,593 --> 01:29:26,193
You can have pizza at a cheap price.

2699
01:29:26,533 --> 01:29:28,262
"Super cost-effective."

2700
01:29:28,263 --> 01:29:29,533
(Super cost-effective)

2701
01:29:30,363 --> 01:29:31,732
A place of memories?

2702
01:29:31,733 --> 01:29:33,002
To enjoy Daehak-ro,

2703
01:29:33,003 --> 01:29:34,723
I believe a place like this is really nice.

2704
01:29:35,643 --> 01:29:37,203
As this place exists,

2705
01:29:37,243 --> 01:29:40,543
we are able to share our suffering and pain together.

2706
01:29:40,943 --> 01:29:42,642
I gain strength when I come here.

2707
01:29:42,643 --> 01:29:44,853
This is that kind of place to me.

2708
01:29:46,883 --> 01:29:50,993
(DMR 2, hof)

2709
01:29:51,693 --> 01:29:52,852
I love the vibes here.

2710
01:29:52,853 --> 01:29:54,593
This place is full of vibes.

2711
01:29:54,793 --> 01:29:57,092
This place has been putting up the posters...

2712
01:29:57,093 --> 01:29:58,893
from such a long time.

2713
01:29:59,163 --> 01:30:00,463
That's from 2014.

2714
01:30:00,803 --> 01:30:02,203
That's from 2008.

2715
01:30:02,463 --> 01:30:03,703
That's from 2008?

2716
01:30:05,233 --> 01:30:06,733
Should we ask the owner...

2717
01:30:06,903 --> 01:30:08,202
about this place?

2718
01:30:08,203 --> 01:30:09,403
Ma'am!

2719
01:30:09,873 --> 01:30:11,212
Hello.

2720
01:30:11,213 --> 01:30:12,872
- Hello.
- Hello.

2721
01:30:12,873 --> 01:30:15,012
Are you the owner of this place that has run this place for 19 years?

2722
01:30:15,013 --> 01:30:16,043
Yes.

2723
01:30:16,643 --> 01:30:18,252
Are you an actress?

2724
01:30:18,253 --> 01:30:19,359
She's not an actress, right?

2725
01:30:19,383 --> 01:30:21,582
- I'm a playwright.
- I see!

2726
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:22,822
- You're a playwright?
- Yes.

2727
01:30:22,823 --> 01:30:24,052
So she's a playwright.

2728
01:30:24,053 --> 01:30:26,752
- They're all related.
- The owners here...

2729
01:30:26,753 --> 01:30:27,892
are all related to this area.

2730
01:30:27,893 --> 01:30:29,392
- They're all related to Daehak-ro.
- Right.

2731
01:30:29,393 --> 01:30:32,063
They're all related to acting or plays.

2732
01:30:32,263 --> 01:30:34,962
I heard this place was known for its great pizza.

2733
01:30:34,963 --> 01:30:36,732
- Right.
- I heard it had the best pizza.

2734
01:30:36,733 --> 01:30:37,773
The pizza is really good.

2735
01:30:37,973 --> 01:30:40,273
Then we should get some pizza.

2736
01:30:40,373 --> 01:30:41,772
Which pizza do you recommend?

2737
01:30:41,773 --> 01:30:43,542
People usually go for Set A.

2738
01:30:43,543 --> 01:30:46,142
They have the cold whelk and gorgonzola pizza.

2739
01:30:46,143 --> 01:30:47,443
- Gorgonzola pizza?
- Yes.

2740
01:30:47,513 --> 01:30:50,042
- We must go with Set A.
- Right.

2741
01:30:50,043 --> 01:30:52,483
Which pizza would you recommend the most?

2742
01:30:52,653 --> 01:30:55,122
These days, I would recommend the arugula pizza.

2743
01:30:55,123 --> 01:30:56,282
- Arugula pizza.
- Arugula pizza.

2744
01:30:56,283 --> 01:30:57,622
- That sounds good.
- That's my favorite.

2745
01:30:57,623 --> 01:30:58,792
I love arugula.

2746
01:30:58,793 --> 01:30:59,952
We'll also get 3 glasses of 500ml beer.

2747
01:30:59,953 --> 01:31:01,022
- You'll get three glasses of beer?
- Okay.

2748
01:31:01,023 --> 01:31:02,893
- Okay.
- Thank you.

2749
01:31:03,163 --> 01:31:05,392
It's fascinating how every owner...

2750
01:31:05,393 --> 01:31:08,102
is related to this area.

2751
01:31:08,103 --> 01:31:10,733
The previous owner said this.

2752
01:31:11,033 --> 01:31:12,033
"The owners of Daehak-ro..."

2753
01:31:12,034 --> 01:31:13,354
- "are the actors." - The actors.

2754
01:31:13,533 --> 01:31:14,603
Gosh, right.

2755
01:31:14,903 --> 01:31:16,473
Excuse me.

2756
01:31:17,103 --> 01:31:18,472
Hey.

2757
01:31:18,473 --> 01:31:19,912
I just heard something...

2758
01:31:19,913 --> 01:31:21,489
- and turned my head toward it.
- Really?

2759
01:31:21,513 --> 01:31:23,483
What are those containers called?

2760
01:31:23,583 --> 01:31:25,013
The draft containers?

2761
01:31:25,113 --> 01:31:26,313
The draft beer containers.

2762
01:31:26,353 --> 01:31:27,559
So that's what they are called here.

2763
01:31:27,583 --> 01:31:28,852
They are called the draft containers here.

2764
01:31:28,853 --> 01:31:31,352
The draft containers were switched to new ones.

2765
01:31:31,353 --> 01:31:33,099
(The beer was poured from a fresh container.)

2766
01:31:33,123 --> 01:31:34,663
- Cheers.
- Right.

2767
01:31:34,723 --> 01:31:35,822
All right. You should say something...

2768
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:37,293
- before we drink.
- Should I?

2769
01:31:37,393 --> 01:31:38,662
Gosh.

2770
01:31:38,663 --> 01:31:40,332
Thank you so much for making your second visit, Daniel.

2771
01:31:40,333 --> 01:31:41,402
Right.

2772
01:31:41,403 --> 01:31:42,532
We'll look forward for your third visit.

2773
01:31:42,533 --> 01:31:43,932
Today will be the last time I will be here.

2774
01:31:43,933 --> 01:31:44,933
(Today will be the last time I will be here.)

2775
01:31:44,934 --> 01:31:46,232
Gosh, he won't fall for it.

2776
01:31:46,233 --> 01:31:47,372
(Gosh, he won't fall for it.)

2777
01:31:47,373 --> 01:31:49,503
(Chugging down)

2778
01:31:51,343 --> 01:31:52,372
(The refreshing sip of beer that Tae Hyun wanted)

2779
01:31:52,373 --> 01:31:53,989
I don't drink that much, but this is really good.

2780
01:31:54,013 --> 01:31:55,042
It tastes so good...

2781
01:31:55,043 --> 01:31:56,319
- as it has been a while.
- It's soft.

2782
01:31:56,343 --> 01:31:58,153
- This is...
- It's the chicken snack!

2783
01:31:58,853 --> 01:31:59,983
These are so good.

2784
01:32:00,613 --> 01:32:01,683
But...

2785
01:32:02,053 --> 01:32:04,422
these aren't the ones sold, are they?

2786
01:32:04,423 --> 01:32:06,669
- No. These are slightly different.
- They taste different.

2787
01:32:06,693 --> 01:32:07,973
These are the ones sold in bulk.

2788
01:32:08,223 --> 01:32:10,292
(Seung Ho gets up from his seat.)

2789
01:32:10,293 --> 01:32:11,392
(Rascal Seung Ho mode on)

2790
01:32:11,393 --> 01:32:12,592
- There he goes again.
- Have some.

2791
01:32:12,593 --> 01:32:13,632
(Unlike the others who are cool about it, )

2792
01:32:13,633 --> 01:32:16,133
(this man feels quite dumbfounded.)

2793
01:32:16,163 --> 01:32:17,872
- Have some.
- Can I have some?

2794
01:32:17,873 --> 01:32:18,973
(Eating)

2795
01:32:19,173 --> 01:32:21,203
- Give me some water.
- I didn't even answer yet.

2796
01:32:23,103 --> 01:32:24,142
It's for you.

2797
01:32:24,143 --> 01:32:25,242
I won't have it.

2798
01:32:25,243 --> 01:32:26,313
Thank you.

2799
01:32:27,173 --> 01:32:29,413
(Rascal Seung Ho goes wild like a crazy train.)

2800
01:32:29,813 --> 01:32:31,252
He's like a thief...

2801
01:32:31,253 --> 01:32:33,013
when we come to the last place.

2802
01:32:33,453 --> 01:32:34,552
Even last time...

2803
01:32:34,553 --> 01:32:36,182
Daniel has frozen up out of shock.

2804
01:32:36,183 --> 01:32:37,523
He's a thief.

2805
01:32:38,223 --> 01:32:40,253
He's more than a rascal. He's a thief.

2806
01:32:41,863 --> 01:32:43,293
Look at him laugh.

2807
01:32:43,863 --> 01:32:45,292
He's a bandit.

2808
01:32:45,293 --> 01:32:46,733
(He's a bandit.)

2809
01:32:47,333 --> 01:32:49,662
There are specific vibes brought by this place.

2810
01:32:49,663 --> 01:32:51,273
The draft beer tastes different...

2811
01:32:51,773 --> 01:32:53,602
at a place like this.

2812
01:32:53,603 --> 01:32:56,703
It reminds me of the times I had beer as a college student.

2813
01:32:56,873 --> 01:32:59,073
Has it been a year since we drank together?

2814
01:32:59,543 --> 01:33:01,283
- It hasn't been over two years.
- Right.

2815
01:33:01,843 --> 01:33:03,742
We should clink our glasses as it has been a while.

2816
01:33:03,743 --> 01:33:05,512
Oh, right.

2817
01:33:05,513 --> 01:33:06,812
(The beer glass is held by Rascal Seung Ho once again.)

2818
01:33:06,813 --> 01:33:07,982
- In a year...
- He's shocked.

2819
01:33:07,983 --> 01:33:09,323
What is up with this guy?

2820
01:33:09,923 --> 01:33:11,823
- Will you have it?
- I won't!

2821
01:33:12,193 --> 01:33:13,473
You should use that cup instead.

2822
01:33:14,193 --> 01:33:16,633
- I was about to go back in time.
- What is up with this guy?

2823
01:33:16,993 --> 01:33:18,433
We reacted like you at first too.

2824
01:33:18,863 --> 01:33:20,032
It's because you won't drink it.

2825
01:33:20,033 --> 01:33:21,362
We reacted like you at first too.

2826
01:33:21,363 --> 01:33:23,132
After a couple of weeks with him,

2827
01:33:23,133 --> 01:33:24,332
we just left him alone.

2828
01:33:24,333 --> 01:33:25,872
(We realized that he couldn't be stopped.)

2829
01:33:25,873 --> 01:33:27,032
If you come one more time,

2830
01:33:27,033 --> 01:33:29,572
we'll give you an exemption card.

2831
01:33:29,573 --> 01:33:31,042
Forget it. I will tear it into pieces.

2832
01:33:31,043 --> 01:33:32,672
(I will tear it into pieces.)

2833
01:33:32,673 --> 01:33:34,312
- He always says that.
- During our time together today,

2834
01:33:34,313 --> 01:33:35,712
what was the biggest factor of what you are feeling right now?

2835
01:33:35,713 --> 01:33:37,793
- The biggest factor?
- What made you feel this way?

2836
01:33:38,213 --> 01:33:40,533
It was when not a single one of the staff members clapped.

2837
01:33:40,853 --> 01:33:42,422
I realized they were all hand in glove with each other.

2838
01:33:42,423 --> 01:33:43,529
(I realized they were all hand in glove with each other.)

2839
01:33:43,553 --> 01:33:46,053
Not a single one of them smiled.

2840
01:33:46,253 --> 01:33:48,523
You got the low kick right after that.

2841
01:33:49,463 --> 01:33:51,633
- No one stopped him from leaving.
- Right.

2842
01:33:52,133 --> 01:33:53,192
He got upset.

2843
01:33:53,193 --> 01:33:54,402
Gosh, he went through a lot of things today.

2844
01:33:54,403 --> 01:33:55,502
A lot happened to him today.

2845
01:33:55,503 --> 01:33:57,362
- But you didn't lose today.
- What?

2846
01:33:57,363 --> 01:33:58,672
- You didn't pay today.
- He didn't pay at all.

2847
01:33:58,673 --> 01:34:00,473
- Right.
- Right.

2848
01:34:00,773 --> 01:34:02,902
It's over if he makes it past this place.

2849
01:34:02,903 --> 01:34:04,242
I came fully prepared.

2850
01:34:04,243 --> 01:34:05,243
You deserve praise for that.

2851
01:34:05,244 --> 01:34:06,742
I didn't fully understand the rules back then.

2852
01:34:06,743 --> 01:34:09,382
Give him a round of applause. Give Daniel a round of applause.

2853
01:34:09,383 --> 01:34:11,982
(The round of applause that he really wished for)

2854
01:34:11,983 --> 01:34:13,012
- There you go.
- Clap!

2855
01:34:13,013 --> 01:34:14,082
Forget it.

2856
01:34:14,083 --> 01:34:15,723
You should've clapped earlier!

2857
01:34:17,223 --> 01:34:18,992
But it'll be great if you visit us again.

2858
01:34:18,993 --> 01:34:19,993
We'll be waiting for you.

2859
01:34:20,253 --> 01:34:21,362
Don't wait for me.

2860
01:34:21,363 --> 01:34:22,393
(Revisit)

2861
01:34:22,623 --> 01:34:23,623
It's here!

2862
01:34:23,624 --> 01:34:25,739
(The pizza they were waiting for makes its appearance.)

2863
01:34:25,763 --> 01:34:26,992
- Gosh!
- What is this?

2864
01:34:26,993 --> 01:34:28,802
- The gorgonzola pizza.
- The arugula pizza.

2865
01:34:28,803 --> 01:34:29,803
Look at that!

2866
01:34:29,804 --> 01:34:31,172
Check out how there's so much of the arugula topped.

2867
01:34:31,173 --> 01:34:32,232
(Check out how there's so much of the arugula topped.)

2868
01:34:32,233 --> 01:34:33,572
Gosh!

2869
01:34:33,573 --> 01:34:35,603
- The cheese will fall to the table.
- Right.

2870
01:34:35,703 --> 01:34:37,943
Gosh, it smells really funky.

2871
01:34:38,043 --> 01:34:39,043
It's so strong.

2872
01:34:39,044 --> 01:34:40,713
I took off my shoes.

2873
01:34:40,843 --> 01:34:42,213
It went all the way up here.

2874
01:34:42,983 --> 01:34:45,453
There was a heat haze when he put his foot up.

2875
01:34:45,983 --> 01:34:47,153
Gosh, my eyes sting.

2876
01:34:47,553 --> 01:34:49,553
- Should we see if it spills down?
- It's amazing.

2877
01:34:50,453 --> 01:34:52,292
(A harmony between stringy cheese...)

2878
01:34:52,293 --> 01:34:56,563
(and shiny honey)

2879
01:34:57,223 --> 01:34:59,662
(Full of various toppings)

2880
01:34:59,663 --> 01:35:04,502
(A fantastic collaboration with the green arugula)

2881
01:35:04,503 --> 01:35:06,602
(Cheese waterfall, gorgonzola pizza)

2882
01:35:06,603 --> 01:35:08,643
(Arugula field, arugula pizza)

2883
01:35:09,403 --> 01:35:10,543
Check if it spills down.

2884
01:35:10,643 --> 01:35:11,843
See how stringy it is.

2885
01:35:12,513 --> 01:35:15,383
Hurry! You have to eat it now!

2886
01:35:15,413 --> 01:35:17,382
(Stretching)

2887
01:35:17,383 --> 01:35:18,553
Play the harp!

2888
01:35:20,213 --> 01:35:22,052
Bring it up!

2889
01:35:22,053 --> 01:35:23,622
- How far will it go up?
- Gosh!

2890
01:35:23,623 --> 01:35:25,052
(The cheese stretches out endlessly.)

2891
01:35:25,053 --> 01:35:26,752
Get on my shoulders!

2892
01:35:26,753 --> 01:35:28,122
- Get on my shoulders!
- Gosh!

2893
01:35:28,123 --> 01:35:29,483
(It's about to reach the ceiling!)

2894
01:35:29,523 --> 01:35:30,592
(Amazed)

2895
01:35:30,593 --> 01:35:31,962
What is this?

2896
01:35:31,963 --> 01:35:33,832
Gosh, how is it like this?

2897
01:35:33,833 --> 01:35:35,033
We need some plates.

2898
01:35:35,933 --> 01:35:36,962
Hold on.

2899
01:35:36,963 --> 01:35:38,283
- Don't do it!
- It's Spider-Man!

2900
01:35:38,373 --> 01:35:39,473
Don't do it!

2901
01:35:39,673 --> 01:35:40,873
Hey! Don't do it!

2902
01:35:41,843 --> 01:35:43,143
(Eating)

2903
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:48,213
(Get some cheese.)

2904
01:35:48,983 --> 01:35:50,642
(Yummy)

2905
01:35:50,643 --> 01:35:52,413
- It's Spider-Man.
- How is it? Is it good?

2906
01:35:53,313 --> 01:35:55,423
- It's really good.
- Really?

2907
01:35:55,453 --> 01:35:57,282
It looks really good.

2908
01:35:57,283 --> 01:35:59,552
(Daniel tries it too.)

2909
01:35:59,553 --> 01:36:01,623
There's honey. Have it with some honey.

2910
01:36:01,823 --> 01:36:04,063
(Startled)

2911
01:36:04,963 --> 01:36:06,033
It's so good.

2912
01:36:06,163 --> 01:36:07,732
(Amazed)

2913
01:36:07,733 --> 01:36:09,032
(Tae Hyun falls in love with the cheese too.)

2914
01:36:09,033 --> 01:36:10,309
There's honey. Have it with some honey.

2915
01:36:10,333 --> 01:36:12,403
(Amazed)

2916
01:36:12,703 --> 01:36:14,403
(It's amazing.)

2917
01:36:14,603 --> 01:36:16,173
It's sweeter than dalgona.

2918
01:36:16,603 --> 01:36:18,373
(Stamping his feet)

2919
01:36:18,813 --> 01:36:21,812
(The cheese feast is incredible.)

2920
01:36:21,813 --> 01:36:23,082
- Gosh.
- That must be good.

2921
01:36:23,083 --> 01:36:24,653
It's really good with some honey.

2922
01:36:24,883 --> 01:36:27,212
- It got all my attention.
- The cheese...

2923
01:36:27,213 --> 01:36:28,222
It's a taste...

2924
01:36:28,223 --> 01:36:29,622
- that really brings up your mood.
- Right.

2925
01:36:29,623 --> 01:36:32,053
Su Jin would love this. My youngest daughter.

2926
01:36:32,293 --> 01:36:33,623
Gosh, that must be good.

2927
01:36:33,653 --> 01:36:35,462
There's so much cheese...

2928
01:36:35,463 --> 01:36:37,323
that it's stronger than the dough.

2929
01:36:37,763 --> 01:36:39,432
The dough disappears first before the cheese.

2930
01:36:39,433 --> 01:36:42,202
This is a thin pizza dough.

2931
01:36:42,203 --> 01:36:44,263
I love it with this thickness.

2932
01:36:44,303 --> 01:36:45,872
- The backside looks really nice.
- The dough disappears first.

2933
01:36:45,873 --> 01:36:47,672
I love how well it was cooked on the backside.

2934
01:36:47,673 --> 01:36:49,373
Is it crunchy on the bottom?

2935
01:36:49,503 --> 01:36:50,673
It's really crunchy.

2936
01:36:51,113 --> 01:36:53,213
This is bought...

2937
01:36:53,313 --> 01:36:56,512
- and it's pasted on top.
- I got it.

2938
01:36:56,513 --> 01:36:58,652
I know what this dough is.

2939
01:36:58,653 --> 01:36:59,783
It's the tortilla dough.

2940
01:36:59,913 --> 01:37:01,183
The tortilla dough?

2941
01:37:01,623 --> 01:37:04,123
I do want to try some of the gorgonzola pizza.

2942
01:37:04,453 --> 01:37:06,052
Let's try some of this.

2943
01:37:06,053 --> 01:37:07,053
- The arugula pizza.
- The arugula pizza.

2944
01:37:07,054 --> 01:37:08,422
But this one also looks...

2945
01:37:08,423 --> 01:37:10,022
- Try getting a piece.
- Gosh.

2946
01:37:10,023 --> 01:37:12,462
It already smells so fragrant.

2947
01:37:12,463 --> 01:37:13,909
(The cheese stretches out just like the gorgonzola pizza.)

2948
01:37:13,933 --> 01:37:15,132
(Their eyes automatically follow the cheese.)

2949
01:37:15,133 --> 01:37:16,933
This one has the cheese too.

2950
01:37:17,133 --> 01:37:18,133
Give this one a try.

2951
01:37:18,134 --> 01:37:21,572
It's amazing how there are onion slices on top too.

2952
01:37:21,573 --> 01:37:23,342
There are olive slices too.

2953
01:37:23,343 --> 01:37:24,743
I'll get you a new one.

2954
01:37:25,513 --> 01:37:27,343
I really like arugula.

2955
01:37:28,183 --> 01:37:30,313
Gosh, that is just insane.

2956
01:37:30,783 --> 01:37:33,313
So this is the arugula pizza?

2957
01:37:33,883 --> 01:37:35,163
Let's try the arugula pizza too.

2958
01:37:35,283 --> 01:37:36,652
The one with the toppings is the arugula pizza.

2959
01:37:36,653 --> 01:37:38,052
This is just a pizza place.

2960
01:37:38,053 --> 01:37:41,922
When you go to a regular pizza place,

2961
01:37:41,923 --> 01:37:44,733
there are just 3 to 4 pieces of arugula on top.

2962
01:37:45,033 --> 01:37:46,873
- Isn't arugula expensive?
- It's really good.

2963
01:37:47,033 --> 01:37:48,303
- I guess so.
- Gosh.

2964
01:37:48,403 --> 01:37:50,162
- It's refreshing.
- Is it good?

2965
01:37:50,163 --> 01:37:52,333
(Dancing while enjoying the taste)

2966
01:37:52,633 --> 01:37:53,703
Is it good?

2967
01:37:54,033 --> 01:37:55,102
The gorgonzola pizza.

2968
01:37:55,103 --> 01:37:56,273
(Eating)

2969
01:38:02,743 --> 01:38:05,382
It's good even with this much arugula.

2970
01:38:05,383 --> 01:38:06,383
Right?

2971
01:38:06,613 --> 01:38:09,382
I think the flavors will burst inside the mouth.

2972
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:11,823
It has this much arugula,

2973
01:38:12,323 --> 01:38:14,293
but it doesn't feel repulsive at all.

2974
01:38:14,423 --> 01:38:17,563
(It's even better with more arugula!)

2975
01:38:17,593 --> 01:38:19,062
Gosh, there's another dish.

2976
01:38:19,063 --> 01:38:20,232
- It's the whelk?
- What is that?

2977
01:38:20,233 --> 01:38:21,402
Here's the cold whelk.

2978
01:38:21,403 --> 01:38:23,032
- What is this?
- What is this?

2979
01:38:23,033 --> 01:38:24,393
(Looks that make you feel curious)

2980
01:38:25,503 --> 01:38:28,572
(Plump whelk...)

2981
01:38:28,573 --> 01:38:32,573
(and cold naengmyeon broth mixed together!)

2982
01:38:33,473 --> 01:38:38,683
(The steady seller of this place, cold whelk noodles)

2983
01:38:38,813 --> 01:38:41,153
Gosh, that is served so nicely.

2984
01:38:41,983 --> 01:38:44,182
Doesn't it look like a whelk punch?

2985
01:38:44,183 --> 01:38:45,923
It's served like a punch.

2986
01:38:46,223 --> 01:38:47,252
Just get the noodles separately.

2987
01:38:47,253 --> 01:38:49,622
It's a bit like cold chicken noodles too.

2988
01:38:49,623 --> 01:38:51,462
You're right. It's like cold chicken noodles.

2989
01:38:51,463 --> 01:38:52,533
(I want some.)

2990
01:38:54,663 --> 01:38:56,033
(Slurping)

2991
01:38:58,273 --> 01:39:02,073
(Gosh, it tastes fascinating.)

2992
01:39:02,843 --> 01:39:03,843
(Blowing)

2993
01:39:03,843 --> 01:39:04,843
I don't have to blow on it.

2994
01:39:04,844 --> 01:39:06,643
(Embarrassed)

2995
01:39:06,773 --> 01:39:10,143
- Why would you blow on it?
- I'm sorry.

2996
01:39:10,543 --> 01:39:11,743
I did it without realizing it.

2997
01:39:13,583 --> 01:39:15,463
Last time, I also kept blowing on cold noodles.

2998
01:39:16,283 --> 01:39:17,383
(Humming)

2999
01:39:17,653 --> 01:39:18,653
What is it?

3000
01:39:18,654 --> 01:39:19,922
(It looks delicious.)

3001
01:39:19,923 --> 01:39:22,192
(While everyone is absorbed in the cold whelk's charm)

3002
01:39:22,193 --> 01:39:23,492
These are vinegar whelk noodles.

3003
01:39:23,493 --> 01:39:26,093
What does it taste like? Could you describe it?

3004
01:39:26,463 --> 01:39:29,703
(He might fall into the plate.)

3005
01:39:30,263 --> 01:39:31,433
(Impressed)

3006
01:39:33,073 --> 01:39:38,043
(Devouring like he's in a trance)

3007
01:39:41,483 --> 01:39:43,183
Didn't you say that you were full?

3008
01:39:44,083 --> 01:39:46,882
- He's totally lost in his food.
- Tae Hyun.

3009
01:39:46,883 --> 01:39:47,922
Lost in his noodles.

3010
01:39:47,923 --> 01:39:49,483
(Lost in his noodles)

3011
01:39:50,223 --> 01:39:52,093
This place is amazing.

3012
01:39:52,553 --> 01:39:53,893
It's really a delicacy.

3013
01:39:58,563 --> 01:40:00,363
(I want some too.)

3014
01:40:00,433 --> 01:40:03,103
Dong Hyun, do you want to describe the taste after a bite?

3015
01:40:03,333 --> 01:40:05,472
If no one claps,

3016
01:40:05,473 --> 01:40:07,132
- you'll get a noogie.
- A noogie?

3017
01:40:07,133 --> 01:40:08,772
- Are your noogies strong?
- Mine are weak.

3018
01:40:08,773 --> 01:40:10,642
- What kind of noogie will it be?
- Like this.

3019
01:40:10,643 --> 01:40:12,342
That's nothing. I'd be happy to do it.

3020
01:40:12,343 --> 01:40:13,512
- Are you okay with it?
- Of course.

3021
01:40:13,513 --> 01:40:14,583
All right.

3022
01:40:14,983 --> 01:40:16,712
Dip it in a lot of honey...

3023
01:40:16,713 --> 01:40:17,882
and describe the taste well.

3024
01:40:17,883 --> 01:40:19,712
- Gosh, the smell is...
- We...

3025
01:40:19,713 --> 01:40:20,753
Seriously,

3026
01:40:21,653 --> 01:40:23,452
please judge me fairly.

3027
01:40:23,453 --> 01:40:26,393
- Please evaluate him fairly.
- The staff will be the judge.

3028
01:40:26,493 --> 01:40:28,392
Please don't consider me...

3029
01:40:28,393 --> 01:40:30,823
as someone that you won't see again.

3030
01:40:30,993 --> 01:40:32,763
- What do you mean?
- I don't know either.

3031
01:40:34,563 --> 01:40:36,632
(He dips it in a lot of honey.)

3032
01:40:36,633 --> 01:40:38,993
- I must dip it in a lot of honey.
- It's really delicious.

3033
01:40:40,473 --> 01:40:42,443
The cheese has a stronger flavor than honey.

3034
01:40:43,603 --> 01:40:45,243
It's a sea of cheese.

3035
01:40:45,373 --> 01:40:46,442
It's no joke.

3036
01:40:46,443 --> 01:40:47,842
(Exclaiming)

3037
01:40:47,843 --> 01:40:49,382
The dough is extremely crunchy.

3038
01:40:49,383 --> 01:40:50,582
- Isn't it incredible?
- It's extremely crunchy.

3039
01:40:50,583 --> 01:40:52,313
The cheese on top is very soft.

3040
01:40:53,453 --> 01:40:55,523
Gosh, it's really delicious.

3041
01:40:56,283 --> 01:40:58,653
- Is that all?
- And... No, I'm still talking.

3042
01:41:01,253 --> 01:41:02,363
The bottom is...

3043
01:41:03,123 --> 01:41:04,893
Which bottom? Do you mean the floor?

3044
01:41:05,063 --> 01:41:06,332
- This...
- The bottom of the dough?

3045
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:08,063
- It's very crunchy.
- Yes.

3046
01:41:08,933 --> 01:41:10,293
Are you done describing the taste?

3047
01:41:10,333 --> 01:41:11,432
I'm just starting.

3048
01:41:11,433 --> 01:41:12,532
(He keeps saying that he's starting.)

3049
01:41:12,533 --> 01:41:15,743
This is really crunchy.

3050
01:41:16,343 --> 01:41:18,573
(I'm doomed.)

3051
01:41:18,613 --> 01:41:21,912
Camera directors and other staff members.

3052
01:41:21,913 --> 01:41:23,582
- Can you imagine Dong Hyun's...
- I mean,

3053
01:41:23,583 --> 01:41:26,312
- this is...
- description in your mouth?

3054
01:41:26,313 --> 01:41:28,153
- This is...
- Please give him an applause.

3055
01:41:28,383 --> 01:41:29,422
Gosh, this is...

3056
01:41:29,423 --> 01:41:31,283
(Quiet)

3057
01:41:31,553 --> 01:41:33,622
- I'm glad that he didn't eat this.
- Give him a noogie.

3058
01:41:33,623 --> 01:41:35,423
- He deserves a noogie.
- Gosh, it's so good.

3059
01:41:35,623 --> 01:41:37,322
- Isn't it delicious?
- It's very delicious.

3060
01:41:37,323 --> 01:41:38,332
Where shall I give you a noogie?

3061
01:41:38,333 --> 01:41:39,692
(Where shall I give you a noogie?)

3062
01:41:39,693 --> 01:41:40,732
That's more important for him.

3063
01:41:40,733 --> 01:41:42,632
I've known him for more than ten years. Do you know his nickname?

3064
01:41:42,633 --> 01:41:44,333
- What is it?
- Russian Roulette Fingers.

3065
01:41:44,503 --> 01:41:46,202
Are you serious? Oh, come on.

3066
01:41:46,203 --> 01:41:47,573
Russian Roulette Hand?

3067
01:41:47,873 --> 01:41:50,002
Why did you pretend to be weak?

3068
01:41:50,003 --> 01:41:51,003
I'm weak.

3069
01:41:51,004 --> 01:41:52,512
He's called Russian Roulette...

3070
01:41:52,513 --> 01:41:54,212
because he hits your eye once out of five times.

3071
01:41:54,213 --> 01:41:55,983
(That's not good.)

3072
01:41:56,283 --> 01:41:58,312
- I flick your eye like this.
- You hit the eye?

3073
01:41:58,313 --> 01:41:59,313
With this part.

3074
01:42:00,583 --> 01:42:02,252
Okay, I understand.

3075
01:42:02,253 --> 01:42:03,422
(How powerful will Russian Roulette Hand be?)

3076
01:42:03,423 --> 01:42:04,482
Can I hit the middle?

3077
01:42:04,483 --> 01:42:05,652
You should aim for the head. Where are you aiming?

3078
01:42:05,653 --> 01:42:07,123
- Okay.
- Hit me here.

3079
01:42:07,493 --> 01:42:09,863
- What's with the hand? Move it.
- More than I thought...

3080
01:42:09,923 --> 01:42:11,092
I'm afraid that you'll hit my eye.

3081
01:42:11,093 --> 01:42:13,333
I promise not to hit your eye.

3082
01:42:14,193 --> 01:42:15,233
(How will it turn out?)

3083
01:42:18,133 --> 01:42:19,272
(Gosh...)

3084
01:42:19,273 --> 01:42:20,902
- It was okay. What was that?
- I missed him.

3085
01:42:20,903 --> 01:42:22,263
There was nothing to be scared of.

3086
01:42:23,773 --> 01:42:25,713
Hey, have another piece of gorgonzola.

3087
01:42:25,913 --> 01:42:27,813
- You can have one more.
- That's a bummer.

3088
01:42:28,243 --> 01:42:29,442
- Have some arugula.
- I should've hit him hard.

3089
01:42:29,443 --> 01:42:31,082
I can eat them all and get five noogies.

3090
01:42:31,083 --> 01:42:32,613
(The remaining pizza)

3091
01:42:32,913 --> 01:42:34,983
- I missed his head.
- That was so weak.

3092
01:42:35,623 --> 01:42:37,452
Now, we should...

3093
01:42:37,453 --> 01:42:38,552
- The bill?
- Yes.

3094
01:42:38,553 --> 01:42:39,722
That's the most important.

3095
01:42:39,723 --> 01:42:41,862
- Will I be able...
- There's also a penalty.

3096
01:42:41,863 --> 01:42:44,163
To defeat Dong Hyun today?

3097
01:42:45,233 --> 01:42:47,392
This is our last bar in Daehak-ro.

3098
01:42:47,393 --> 01:42:49,113
- I can't lose in this round.
- Here it is.

3099
01:42:49,303 --> 01:42:52,002
The tradition of toasting was originated...

3100
01:42:52,003 --> 01:42:53,603
from the Viking culture in North Europe.

3101
01:42:53,933 --> 01:42:56,742
After battles, Viking warriors would drink...

3102
01:42:56,743 --> 01:42:59,212
with their enemies...

3103
01:42:59,213 --> 01:43:00,573
to maintain good relations.

3104
01:43:01,613 --> 01:43:04,282
It's said that the custom of clinking glasses...

3105
01:43:04,283 --> 01:43:06,383
while drinking started during those moments.

3106
01:43:06,583 --> 01:43:09,923
What was the real reason behind toasting?

3107
01:43:09,953 --> 01:43:12,992
- Everyone should know...
- I know the answer.

3108
01:43:12,993 --> 01:43:14,093
Me too.

3109
01:43:15,993 --> 01:43:17,892
(Will they get away from the makeup penalty?)

3110
01:43:17,893 --> 01:43:19,962
Everyone, scream!

3111
01:43:19,963 --> 01:43:21,232
Would you like to say your answer first?

3112
01:43:21,233 --> 01:43:22,403
Take out your credit card.

3113
01:43:22,903 --> 01:43:25,572
- Is there something?
- Everyone knows the answer.

3114
01:43:25,573 --> 01:43:26,872
Really? I don't.

3115
01:43:26,873 --> 01:43:28,002
Those who know know.

3116
01:43:28,003 --> 01:43:31,543
I didn't even understand the question.

3117
01:43:31,643 --> 01:43:34,572
Here's what happened in the past.

3118
01:43:34,573 --> 01:43:37,542
It was possible to die from poison in your drink.

3119
01:43:37,543 --> 01:43:39,612
- Yes, this is it.
- As you can see in the poster,

3120
01:43:39,613 --> 01:43:42,052
the beer rises as the glasses clink hard.

3121
01:43:42,053 --> 01:43:44,452
- They mixed their drinks...
- Right, this is it.

3122
01:43:44,453 --> 01:43:46,422
To show their trust in each other.

3123
01:43:46,423 --> 01:43:47,893
- Yes, this is it.
- Scream!

3124
01:43:48,593 --> 01:43:49,593
- Does it sound correct?
- This is it.

3125
01:43:49,594 --> 01:43:51,423
(That's correct!)

3126
01:43:51,563 --> 01:43:52,632
It's 100 percent.

3127
01:43:52,633 --> 01:43:53,992
(It already feels like the right answer.)

3128
01:43:53,993 --> 01:43:55,533
How shall we do their makeup?

3129
01:43:56,363 --> 01:43:57,432
- Isn't it correct?
- It is.

3130
01:43:57,433 --> 01:43:58,532
- Isn't it correct?
- To see if there was poison.

3131
01:43:58,533 --> 01:43:59,573
I'm 100 percent sure.

3132
01:44:00,433 --> 01:44:01,472
Cheers.

3133
01:44:01,473 --> 01:44:03,172
(I trust you, Yi Kyung.)

3134
01:44:03,173 --> 01:44:05,812
Okay, we're also ready.

3135
01:44:05,813 --> 01:44:07,142
- Here it is.
- Take out your card.

3136
01:44:07,143 --> 01:44:09,142
- Even if it's wrong...
- I'll take mine out too.

3137
01:44:09,143 --> 01:44:10,512
- This is correct.
- I'm 100 percent sure.

3138
01:44:10,513 --> 01:44:11,513
It's correct.

3139
01:44:11,853 --> 01:44:14,312
- That looks so funny.
- I bet I'll pay three times today.

3140
01:44:14,313 --> 01:44:15,583
(Ready to pay with their card)

3141
01:44:15,723 --> 01:44:18,552
To prove that there's no poison in each other's drink.

3142
01:44:18,553 --> 01:44:19,722
- Yes.
- To trust each other?

3143
01:44:19,723 --> 01:44:20,822
Yes.

3144
01:44:20,823 --> 01:44:22,022
(Certain)

3145
01:44:22,023 --> 01:44:23,092
That's accurate.

3146
01:44:23,093 --> 01:44:25,539
(Answer: To prove that there's no poison in each other's drink)

3147
01:44:25,563 --> 01:44:26,732
(Dancing)

3148
01:44:26,733 --> 01:44:31,572
That's Yi Kyung Bus for you.

3149
01:44:31,573 --> 01:44:32,602
(Sigh...)

3150
01:44:32,603 --> 01:44:34,903
I didn't pay even once today.

3151
01:44:35,303 --> 01:44:37,042
- Daniel and Yi Kyung Bus.
- Right.

3152
01:44:37,043 --> 01:44:38,442
- I didn't pay even once.
- You're the best.

3153
01:44:38,443 --> 01:44:39,472
I didn't pay even once.

3154
01:44:39,473 --> 01:44:40,972
- Shall I take my card back?
- Here it is.

3155
01:44:40,973 --> 01:44:42,782
- I'll put it here.
- Yes.

3156
01:44:42,783 --> 01:44:44,982
I knew the exact answer.

3157
01:44:44,983 --> 01:44:47,912
Give us a question with the same difficulty level.

3158
01:44:47,913 --> 01:44:48,982
(Automatically, Dong Hyun will get the penalty.)

3159
01:44:48,983 --> 01:44:51,123
- It was ridiculously easy.
- I had no idea about it.

3160
01:44:51,253 --> 01:44:53,323
Here's a quiz to decide who will pay.

3161
01:44:54,323 --> 01:44:56,492
The origin of Korea's food tent isn't clear,

3162
01:44:56,493 --> 01:44:58,932
but it's said to have started in the 1950s...

3163
01:44:58,933 --> 01:45:01,432
with vendors who set up roadside stands...

3164
01:45:01,433 --> 01:45:05,633
covered with cotton fabric to serve simple snacks and soju.

3165
01:45:05,933 --> 01:45:07,502
Back then, popular bar food included...

3166
01:45:07,503 --> 01:45:09,742
fishcake, grilled ginkgo nuts, noodles,

3167
01:45:09,743 --> 01:45:11,573
and this.

3168
01:45:11,673 --> 01:45:14,883
These days, it's hard to find. What is this?

3169
01:45:15,813 --> 01:45:17,182
- Back then...
- I don't know.

3170
01:45:17,183 --> 01:45:20,553
We ate it back then, but is it illegal now?

3171
01:45:20,953 --> 01:45:22,382
It's not illegal,

3172
01:45:22,383 --> 01:45:24,482
but maybe it's not common because there's less demand.

3173
01:45:24,483 --> 01:45:25,492
- Isn't it...
- I got it.

3174
01:45:25,493 --> 01:45:26,953
- Yes?
- Pupa?

3175
01:45:27,293 --> 01:45:29,122
- Pupa?
- There are a lot.

3176
01:45:29,123 --> 01:45:30,223
That sounds reasonable.

3177
01:45:30,493 --> 01:45:31,693
It must be pupa.

3178
01:45:31,863 --> 01:45:33,762
- It's uncommon these days.
- There are a lot of pupas.

3179
01:45:33,763 --> 01:45:35,363
- Incorrect.
- I got it.

3180
01:45:35,463 --> 01:45:37,163
- There are so many pupas.
- Frogs.

3181
01:45:37,233 --> 01:45:38,233
- Frogs?
- That sounds reasonable.

3182
01:45:38,234 --> 01:45:39,272
It does.

3183
01:45:39,273 --> 01:45:40,632
- Frogs sound reasonable.
- That's correct.

3184
01:45:40,633 --> 01:45:41,702
- It must be frogs.
- Frogs sound reasonable?

3185
01:45:41,703 --> 01:45:42,703
- Frogs?
- I think it's incorrect.

3186
01:45:42,704 --> 01:45:44,343
- Incorrect.
- The answer isn't frogs?

3187
01:45:44,643 --> 01:45:46,972
- I thought that it was frogs.
- Me too.

3188
01:45:46,973 --> 01:45:48,073
Frogs sound reasonable.

3189
01:45:48,583 --> 01:45:51,143
- Frogs...
- Why is it hard to find?

3190
01:45:51,243 --> 01:45:53,353
- Is it something similar?
- Grilled quails.

3191
01:45:54,653 --> 01:45:55,782
I got it.

3192
01:45:55,783 --> 01:45:56,783
(Shouting)

3193
01:45:56,784 --> 01:45:58,922
(I got it.)

3194
01:45:58,923 --> 01:45:59,923
What is it?

3195
01:45:59,924 --> 01:46:02,223
Grilled sparrows.

3196
01:46:02,563 --> 01:46:04,162
In the past, people ate sparrows.

3197
01:46:04,163 --> 01:46:06,092
- That's true.
- I don't know about quails.

3198
01:46:06,093 --> 01:46:07,332
Is your answer sparrows or quails?

3199
01:46:07,333 --> 01:46:08,502
- It's definitely sparrows.
- Okay.

3200
01:46:08,503 --> 01:46:09,902
People used to eat sparrows in the past.

3201
01:46:09,903 --> 01:46:12,672
We ate sparrows in the past. That's right.

3202
01:46:12,673 --> 01:46:13,832
- Sparrows must be correct.
- Is it?

3203
01:46:13,833 --> 01:46:15,042
That's what I think too.

3204
01:46:15,043 --> 01:46:16,372
- Sparrows.
- Correct.

3205
01:46:16,373 --> 01:46:18,002
(Answer: Grilled sparrows)

3206
01:46:18,003 --> 01:46:19,842
- To be honest...
- I broke the flow.

3207
01:46:19,843 --> 01:46:21,012
You thought of it when he said quail.

3208
01:46:21,013 --> 01:46:23,213
- Didn't quail remind you of that?
- That's right.

3209
01:46:23,313 --> 01:46:24,443
It existed in the past.

3210
01:46:24,843 --> 01:46:26,482
Okay, Dong Hyun is exempted.

3211
01:46:26,483 --> 01:46:27,752
(Dong Hyun is exempted from paying.)

3212
01:46:27,753 --> 01:46:29,022
I broke the flow.

3213
01:46:29,023 --> 01:46:30,953
- Let's move onto the next quiz.
- The ending.

3214
01:46:31,583 --> 01:46:32,823
I hope that I won't pay.

3215
01:46:33,153 --> 01:46:36,993
As the price of whiskey was high even in the 1970s,

3216
01:46:37,063 --> 01:46:39,792
a beverage similar to whiskey was sold...

3217
01:46:39,793 --> 01:46:41,702
at that time.

3218
01:46:41,703 --> 01:46:43,762
It was promoted as something you could mix with soju...

3219
01:46:43,763 --> 01:46:47,302
to enjoy it like liquor or a cocktail.

3220
01:46:47,303 --> 01:46:50,572
What's the name of this beverage with one syllable?

3221
01:46:50,573 --> 01:46:52,043
I got it. Rum?

3222
01:46:53,173 --> 01:46:54,642
- Incorrect.
- It's a beverage.

3223
01:46:54,643 --> 01:46:56,742
Is the answer the brand name of this beverage?

3224
01:46:56,743 --> 01:46:58,703
- Yes, that's correct.
- The name of the product.

3225
01:46:58,783 --> 01:47:00,613
How would we know that?

3226
01:47:00,913 --> 01:47:02,623
Try each Korean character.

3227
01:47:02,753 --> 01:47:03,753
It's only one syllable.

3228
01:47:04,053 --> 01:47:05,492
I got it. Ga.

3229
01:47:05,493 --> 01:47:07,022
(Answer: Ga)

3230
01:47:07,023 --> 01:47:08,363
I got it. Na.

3231
01:47:08,763 --> 01:47:09,992
You go first.

3232
01:47:09,993 --> 01:47:11,792
You said up to na. I'll say da.

3233
01:47:11,793 --> 01:47:13,263
You say ra. Da.

3234
01:47:13,463 --> 01:47:14,669
- Incorrect.
- What's the hint?

3235
01:47:14,693 --> 01:47:16,802
The answer is in the question.

3236
01:47:16,803 --> 01:47:18,672
- I got it. Yang.
- Incorrect.

3237
01:47:18,673 --> 01:47:20,432
- I got it. Alcohol.
- Incorrect.

3238
01:47:20,433 --> 01:47:21,773
- Joo?
- Incorrect.

3239
01:47:22,173 --> 01:47:24,803
This will take too long.

3240
01:47:24,943 --> 01:47:27,772
Are you saying that among the syllables in the question,

3241
01:47:27,773 --> 01:47:29,942
the answer is one of them?

3242
01:47:29,943 --> 01:47:32,023
- That syllable means something.
- It has a meaning.

3243
01:47:32,153 --> 01:47:33,712
It has a meaning?

3244
01:47:33,713 --> 01:47:35,852
What could it be? In the 70s...

3245
01:47:35,853 --> 01:47:37,553
It's one syllable, and it has a meaning.

3246
01:47:37,823 --> 01:47:39,992
Right. Is the answer cho?

3247
01:47:39,993 --> 01:47:41,122
Cho is incorrect.

3248
01:47:41,123 --> 01:47:43,093
(Making a sound)

3249
01:47:43,463 --> 01:47:44,463
Incorrect.

3250
01:47:44,464 --> 01:47:45,932
- It's hard.
- It's really hard.

3251
01:47:45,933 --> 01:47:48,233
Incorrect. Here's another hint.

3252
01:47:48,293 --> 01:47:50,762
- How.
- How?

3253
01:47:50,763 --> 01:47:51,872
(Hint 2, how)

3254
01:47:51,873 --> 01:47:53,372
(Thinking)

3255
01:47:53,373 --> 01:47:54,633
- I got it.
- Yes?

3256
01:47:55,503 --> 01:47:57,172
(Did Seung Ho get it?)

3257
01:47:57,173 --> 01:47:58,543
Wait a minute.

3258
01:47:58,643 --> 01:48:01,443
He's got it.

3259
01:48:03,043 --> 01:48:04,212
Tom.

3260
01:48:04,213 --> 01:48:05,412
"Tom?"

3261
01:48:05,413 --> 01:48:07,412
- I've heard of it.
- Did Tom exist?

3262
01:48:07,413 --> 01:48:08,452
(Laughing)

3263
01:48:08,453 --> 01:48:10,182
(He takes his card back with certainty.)

3264
01:48:10,183 --> 01:48:11,283
Incorrect.

3265
01:48:12,993 --> 01:48:15,593
What does "Tom" have to do with how?

3266
01:48:15,623 --> 01:48:17,623
Isn't how the hint you gave us?

3267
01:48:17,993 --> 01:48:19,332
I got it, Tan.

3268
01:48:19,333 --> 01:48:20,833
- Tan?
- Did Tan exist?

3269
01:48:20,993 --> 01:48:22,703
- Incorrect.
- The answer is Ta.

3270
01:48:22,763 --> 01:48:24,803
Ta? Correct.

3271
01:48:25,033 --> 01:48:26,033
(What?)

3272
01:48:26,034 --> 01:48:28,202
- "Ta?" - We said tom, tan, and ta.

3273
01:48:28,203 --> 01:48:30,642
- What does it have to do with how?
- Exactly.

3274
01:48:30,643 --> 01:48:31,943
"Mix it."

3275
01:48:32,743 --> 01:48:34,272
"Mix it?"

3276
01:48:34,273 --> 01:48:35,483
(Mix it with the beverage.)

3277
01:48:36,143 --> 01:48:37,183
Wait a minute.

3278
01:48:38,283 --> 01:48:39,652
(It's really called Ta.)

3279
01:48:39,653 --> 01:48:42,382
- Soju tastes like liquor. Ta.
- Did it exist, Tae Hyun?

3280
01:48:42,383 --> 01:48:43,883
I have no idea.

3281
01:48:44,453 --> 01:48:45,892
It doesn't look like it's from the 70s.

3282
01:48:45,893 --> 01:48:47,453
That's hilarious.

3283
01:48:47,593 --> 01:48:49,622
It sounds intuitive.

3284
01:48:49,623 --> 01:48:50,862
- I remember it.
- Ta.

3285
01:48:50,863 --> 01:48:51,962
- Ta.
- Ta.

3286
01:48:51,963 --> 01:48:53,723
(The intuitive naming style of the old days)

3287
01:48:54,363 --> 01:48:57,203
If we had continued with the Korean characters, we would've been right.

3288
01:48:57,363 --> 01:48:59,372
If we had continued with the Korean characters, we would've been right.

3289
01:48:59,373 --> 01:49:01,802
We should've taken the Russian Roulette approach.

3290
01:49:01,803 --> 01:49:03,402
- You guys should've done it.
- It would've been fun.

3291
01:49:03,403 --> 01:49:04,542
Then we would've been right. Hold on.

3292
01:49:04,543 --> 01:49:05,742
Let's see who would've gotten it right.

3293
01:49:05,743 --> 01:49:06,812
- Hold on.
- Ga, na.

3294
01:49:06,813 --> 01:49:08,583
- Na.
- Da, ra, ma, ba, sa.

3295
01:49:08,843 --> 01:49:10,242
- Ah, ja, cha, ka.
- Ah, ja, cha, ka.

3296
01:49:10,243 --> 01:49:11,243
Ta!

3297
01:49:11,443 --> 01:49:13,243
- That's right.
- I would've gotten it right!

3298
01:49:13,313 --> 01:49:15,382
- It's Ta.
- I told you that it was Ta.

3299
01:49:15,383 --> 01:49:16,752
I would've gotten it right!

3300
01:49:16,753 --> 01:49:18,322
(Laughing)

3301
01:49:18,323 --> 01:49:20,523
What are we going to do with those rascals?

3302
01:49:22,023 --> 01:49:23,943
- You should've done it.
- We should've done it.

3303
01:49:24,193 --> 01:49:26,192
- It would've ended quickly.
- That was incredible.

3304
01:49:26,193 --> 01:49:28,132
- You should've done it.
- We should've done it.

3305
01:49:28,133 --> 01:49:29,763
- Seriously.
- It's too bad.

3306
01:49:30,233 --> 01:49:32,532
Daniel was successful today. He avoided paying.

3307
01:49:32,533 --> 01:49:34,133
- He avoided paying.
- I avoided paying.

3308
01:49:34,333 --> 01:49:35,919
You visited the show for the second time.

3309
01:49:35,943 --> 01:49:37,543
We want to know how the shoot was today.

3310
01:49:38,403 --> 01:49:42,342
Today, I visited Handsome Guys.

3311
01:49:42,343 --> 01:49:44,082
It was nice...

3312
01:49:44,083 --> 01:49:47,253
to have a fun time and make good memories together.

3313
01:49:47,483 --> 01:49:49,853
- Lastly...
- I hope everyone will be happy.

3314
01:49:50,753 --> 01:49:53,622
Why are you saying the final goodbye?

3315
01:49:53,623 --> 01:49:55,662
I'll cherish...

3316
01:49:55,663 --> 01:49:57,092
these good memories.

3317
01:49:57,093 --> 01:49:58,222
Are you going someplace far?

3318
01:49:58,223 --> 01:50:01,593
Let me give this early greeting to the viewers.

3319
01:50:01,733 --> 01:50:02,863
Happy New Year!

3320
01:50:04,633 --> 01:50:06,433
We had a happy time thanks to Daniel.

3321
01:50:06,873 --> 01:50:08,402
- Thank you.
- It was fun.

3322
01:50:08,403 --> 01:50:09,963
(We had a happy time thanks to Daniel.)

3323
01:50:10,043 --> 01:50:11,502
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

3324
01:50:11,503 --> 01:50:12,612
Thank you.

3325
01:50:12,613 --> 01:50:14,313
- Sang Uk didn't plan to pay.
- Thank you.

3326
01:50:14,913 --> 01:50:16,913
Daniel, get on the bus of victory!

3327
01:50:17,243 --> 01:50:19,913
- Get on it!
- Get on it!

3328
01:50:19,953 --> 01:50:21,982
Now, get on it!

3329
01:50:21,983 --> 01:50:23,129
(Daniel, take the bus of victory to visit Handsome Guys again.)

3330
01:50:23,369 --> 01:50:25,009
(The next menu recommendation of the day)

3331
01:50:25,247 --> 01:50:27,546
(The exotic-looking streets stand out...)

3332
01:50:27,547 --> 01:50:29,617
(in Seoul's little France.)

3333
01:50:29,747 --> 01:50:32,063
(It's an old-time, rich neighborhood with many luxury houses.)

3334
01:50:32,087 --> 01:50:33,887
(Bangbae-dong and Seorae Village)

3335
01:50:34,187 --> 01:50:35,956
(Who is the guest of the day?)

3336
01:50:35,957 --> 01:50:37,487
- Byung Eun.
- Hello.

3337
01:50:37,557 --> 01:50:39,687
(Tae Hyun's best friend, Actor Park Byung Eun)

3338
01:50:39,887 --> 01:50:41,363
(He has the tone from "Food Travel.")

3339
01:50:41,387 --> 01:50:42,797
(He has a professor's tone.)

3340
01:50:43,057 --> 01:50:45,197
(Good restaurant travel with Professor Foodie)

3341
01:50:45,667 --> 01:50:46,726
(What are the recommended menus at the neighborhood...)

3342
01:50:46,727 --> 01:50:47,797
(of tradition and fusion?)

3343
01:50:47,997 --> 01:50:51,037
(For the first time on the show, they'll have a group meal.)

3344
01:50:51,297 --> 01:50:52,336
(Since there are six of us, )

3345
01:50:52,337 --> 01:50:53,667
(the total sum will be hefty.)

3346
01:50:53,737 --> 01:50:54,737
(Hey!)

3347
01:50:54,738 --> 01:50:55,818
(We shouldn't order a lot.)

3348
01:50:55,877 --> 01:50:58,477
(The oldest member warns the rascals.)

3349
01:50:58,777 --> 01:51:00,247
(He loves the restaurant.)

3350
01:51:00,277 --> 01:51:02,947
(Ordering)

3351
01:51:03,417 --> 01:51:05,886
(He orders the dishes like there's no tomorrow.)

3352
01:51:05,887 --> 01:51:06,887
(Please give me these items.)

3353
01:51:06,888 --> 01:51:08,287
(All of these items)

3354
01:51:08,657 --> 01:51:10,887
(- How many dishes... - Are more people coming?)

3355
01:51:11,117 --> 01:51:12,757
(Those rascals are scary.)

3356
01:51:13,287 --> 01:51:15,427
(It's nearly impossible to stop them.)

3357
01:51:15,757 --> 01:51:17,056
(Changed rule 2: If they succeed in a group mission, )

3358
01:51:17,057 --> 01:51:18,497
(the production crew will pay.)

3359
01:51:18,767 --> 01:51:22,037
(Now, it's a match against the production crew!)

3360
01:51:22,667 --> 01:51:24,537
(The group match starts.)

3361
01:51:24,667 --> 01:51:27,567
(I haven't been this nervous in a long time.)

3362
01:51:27,767 --> 01:51:30,206
(The war to decide who pays...)

3363
01:51:30,207 --> 01:51:32,477
(becomes as fierce as ever.)

3364
01:51:32,577 --> 01:51:34,076
(Handsome versus the production crew)

3365
01:51:34,077 --> 01:51:35,577
(How will this war end?)
