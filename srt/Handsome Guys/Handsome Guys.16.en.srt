00:00:15,402 --> 00:00:18,611
(Choo Sung Hoon who came to replace Dong Hyun for 1 day)

2
00:00:18,612 --> 00:00:22,142
(And Kwak Si Yang as a real guest)

3
00:00:22,342 --> 00:00:26,552
(Eating to their heart's content)

4
00:00:27,782 --> 00:00:30,022
(Gangwon Province race where they exercise and have fun)

5
00:00:30,192 --> 00:00:32,052
(Adding more fun to the race)

6
00:00:32,252 --> 00:00:35,191
(New cards have appeared.)

7
00:00:35,192 --> 00:00:36,808
(Team Guys' new card, exercise transfer card)

8
00:00:36,832 --> 00:00:38,491
(Team Handsome obtained an almighty card.)

9
00:00:38,492 --> 00:00:40,562
(Anxious)

10
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,361
(Thanks to Tae Hyun, )

11
00:00:42,362 --> 00:00:46,072
(Team Guys won the starting point.)

12
00:00:46,442 --> 00:00:49,001
(By using a reattempt card in Pyeongchang, )

13
00:00:49,002 --> 00:00:50,812
(they won.)

14
00:00:51,242 --> 00:00:53,742
(While they were ahead of the game and feeling good)

15
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:56,982
(However, Team Handsome used their wish card.)

16
00:00:57,282 --> 00:01:00,252
(Turning off the alarm for the opposing team)

17
00:01:00,582 --> 00:01:04,222
(The chase began in silence.)

18
00:01:04,692 --> 00:01:05,791
(In Sokcho, )

19
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,422
(they used their reattempt card.)

20
00:01:07,622 --> 00:01:09,892
(Team Handsome is chasing after Team Guys quietly.)

21
00:01:10,332 --> 00:01:12,172
(Why isn't their alarm going off for so long?)

22
00:01:12,332 --> 00:01:14,402
(Due to the alarm not going off)

23
00:01:14,602 --> 00:01:17,972
(Team Guys fell into a trap.)

24
00:01:18,232 --> 00:01:20,702
(By winning Gangneung, they were sure to win.)

25
00:01:21,302 --> 00:01:25,812
(They got excited at the thought of going sledding.)

26
00:01:26,342 --> 00:01:31,252
(Tortoise Team Handsome continued to chase after them.)

27
00:01:31,652 --> 00:01:34,352
(Hare Team Guys took their time.)

28
00:01:34,852 --> 00:01:38,492
(How will the hare and tortoise race end?)

29
00:01:38,592 --> 00:01:41,992
(Coming soon)

30
00:01:42,462 --> 00:01:43,732
It's nice that the sun is out.

31
00:01:44,232 --> 00:01:46,902
- It feels warm. - The weather is beautiful.

32
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:49,331
What are raw fish noodles?

33
00:01:49,332 --> 00:01:50,971
They could be similar to our last dish.

34
00:01:50,972 --> 00:01:52,971
Instead of raw pollack,

35
00:01:52,972 --> 00:01:54,932
- it could be served with raw fish. - Is that so?

36
00:01:56,672 --> 00:01:57,742
Raw fish noodles.

37
00:01:58,242 --> 00:02:01,142
It looks like an authentic local restaurant.

38
00:02:02,082 --> 00:02:03,511
(Sokcho B: Raw fish noodles)

39
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:04,982
Hello.

40
00:02:05,712 --> 00:02:06,952
- Gosh. - Hello.

41
00:02:08,752 --> 00:02:13,592
(Handsome Heritage 5, Raw flatfish and noodles)

42
00:02:14,122 --> 00:02:15,521
Since we don't have much time,

43
00:02:15,522 --> 00:02:17,461
why don't we order only one?

44
00:02:17,462 --> 00:02:18,532
- Just one? - Yes.

45
00:02:18,692 --> 00:02:20,602
- Have some more. - It's okay.

46
00:02:21,002 --> 00:02:22,431
How much we eat should depend on the situation.

47
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:24,001
No, it's okay.

48
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:26,072
- We can eat everything and lose. - No.

49
00:02:26,842 --> 00:02:28,701
- Why are you thinking about losing? - I mean...

50
00:02:28,702 --> 00:02:29,841
- It's possible to win. - Sir.

51
00:02:29,842 --> 00:02:31,241
- After eating everything... - I'm sorry,

52
00:02:31,242 --> 00:02:33,071
but could we order one raw fish noodles?

53
00:02:33,072 --> 00:02:34,141
Sure.

54
00:02:34,142 --> 00:02:35,641
- We don't have much time. - Okay.

55
00:02:35,642 --> 00:02:36,712
Thank you.

56
00:02:36,912 --> 00:02:38,012
Both of you...

57
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:39,782
must be full now.

58
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:42,181
If I may take a guess, I can tell...

59
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:43,622
from your eyes that you're sleepy.

60
00:02:44,152 --> 00:02:45,221
I'm not sleepy.

61
00:02:45,222 --> 00:02:47,392
Actually, I was sleepy from the start.

62
00:02:47,692 --> 00:02:48,761
Because you're jet-lagged?

63
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:50,632
I'm very drowsy because I'm jet-lagged.

64
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:53,031
We have to win these two.

65
00:02:53,032 --> 00:02:55,432
We put them to sleep for 30 minutes. Let's get this quickly.

66
00:02:55,702 --> 00:02:57,671
The question is how we get there after stopping by Goseong.

67
00:02:57,672 --> 00:02:58,731
(In a haze)

68
00:02:58,732 --> 00:03:01,071
It will take quite some time from Goseong to Yangyang.

69
00:03:01,072 --> 00:03:03,412
(Yawning)

70
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:06,981
- From Goseong... - Things are going...

71
00:03:06,982 --> 00:03:08,382
just like Yi Kyung said.

72
00:03:08,912 --> 00:03:09,912
I'm sleepy now.

73
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:11,458
- Can I tell you one more thing? - What?

74
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,811
You will keep losing including your individual game.

75
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:14,781
(Prophet Kyung-stradamus)

76
00:03:14,782 --> 00:03:15,782
It's true.

77
00:03:15,783 --> 00:03:16,921
- Hello. - I witnessed...

78
00:03:16,922 --> 00:03:17,922
- Gosh. - Raw fish noodles.

79
00:03:17,923 --> 00:03:19,403
- Here are your noodles. - Thank you.

80
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:21,321
We already ate before coming here.

81
00:03:21,322 --> 00:03:22,621
I'm sorry for making one order.

82
00:03:22,622 --> 00:03:23,632
It's okay.

83
00:03:26,832 --> 00:03:29,432
(Raw fish noodles that Team Handsome ordered)

84
00:03:30,172 --> 00:03:33,342
(Fresh raw fish is placed on top of vegetables.)

85
00:03:34,372 --> 00:03:36,772
(A special sauce is poured on top.)

86
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:39,172
(Shake it)

87
00:03:40,342 --> 00:03:42,711
(Once cooked thin noodles are added, )

88
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:46,152
(mix them with the sauce.)

89
00:03:50,792 --> 00:03:56,662
(Noodles and seasoned raw fish are placed in a bowl in order.)

90
00:03:58,192 --> 00:04:00,301
(Delicious raw fish noodles are ready.)

91
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:01,801
- Thank you. - Thank you, sir.

92
00:04:01,802 --> 00:04:03,408
How long has this restaurant been around?

93
00:04:03,432 --> 00:04:05,471
It's been around for ten years.

94
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:06,472
Ten years?

95
00:04:06,642 --> 00:04:08,571
- Mulberry vinegar gochujang... - Yes.

96
00:04:08,572 --> 00:04:09,941
We have two types of vinegar gochujang.

97
00:04:09,942 --> 00:04:12,171
Your dish has been mixed with mulberry vinegar gochujang.

98
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:14,911
You may add if you need more.

99
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:15,912
- We can do it on our own plates. - Yes.

100
00:04:15,913 --> 00:04:17,181
- Okay. - Share the food.

101
00:04:17,182 --> 00:04:18,652
- Please try it. - Okay.

102
00:04:18,782 --> 00:04:19,782
Enjoy your food.

103
00:04:19,783 --> 00:04:21,281
The restaurant owner is very cheerful.

104
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:22,782
Let's mix them.

105
00:04:23,292 --> 00:04:24,532
He served us a lot of raw fish.

106
00:04:24,622 --> 00:04:27,161
(Filled with raw fish)

107
00:04:27,162 --> 00:04:28,562
Sir, what type of fish is it?

108
00:04:29,362 --> 00:04:31,832
- It's flatfish. - Flatfish?

109
00:04:32,862 --> 00:04:35,202
I removed the bones in the middle of a flatfish.

110
00:04:35,262 --> 00:04:37,502
Small bones on both sides remain intact.

111
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:41,441
Usually, unboned sliced raw fish is tasty...

112
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:42,702
when it has bones in it.

113
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:45,241
However, most people don't chew noodles...

114
00:04:45,242 --> 00:04:46,741
for a long time.

115
00:04:46,742 --> 00:04:50,311
If it has too many bones, it'd be hard to eat.

116
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:52,481
- You did it on purpose. - Of course.

117
00:04:52,482 --> 00:04:53,621
- I knew it. - Yes.

118
00:04:53,622 --> 00:04:54,681
That's why.

119
00:04:54,682 --> 00:04:56,821
(Raw flatfish noodles made with care and consideration)

120
00:04:56,822 --> 00:04:58,862
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

121
00:04:59,052 --> 00:05:00,572
Mixed with mulberry vinegar gochujang,

122
00:05:00,862 --> 00:05:03,182
this is Sokcho raw fish noodles with ten years of history.

123
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,431
(Slurping)

124
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:09,062
(Humming)

125
00:05:09,332 --> 00:05:11,472
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

126
00:05:21,412 --> 00:05:23,711
(Taking a huge bite)

127
00:05:23,712 --> 00:05:24,912
It's very delicious.

128
00:05:29,982 --> 00:05:33,492
The flatfish has small bones like unboned sliced raw fish.

129
00:05:33,962 --> 00:05:35,892
They're easy to chew on. They aren't unpleasant.

130
00:05:37,262 --> 00:05:38,632
The savory taste is insane.

131
00:05:45,272 --> 00:05:46,372
It's very savory.

132
00:05:52,572 --> 00:05:55,642
(The taste makes you forget about sleep.)

133
00:05:55,882 --> 00:05:57,382
I love the sauce.

134
00:06:01,522 --> 00:06:02,652
(Humming)

135
00:06:02,822 --> 00:06:03,851
What would you like?

136
00:06:03,852 --> 00:06:05,252
I want to try this.

137
00:06:06,122 --> 00:06:07,261
Pomegranate vinegar gochujang.

138
00:06:07,262 --> 00:06:08,391
(Si Yang pours pomegranate vinegar gochujang.)

139
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:09,622
The color is unusual.

140
00:06:10,632 --> 00:06:12,062
It's very delicious.

141
00:06:13,132 --> 00:06:17,272
(Yi Kyung also tries pomegranate vinegar gochujang.)

142
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:20,578
The pomegranate vinegar gochujang is more refreshing.

143
00:06:20,602 --> 00:06:22,542
I think the mulberry makes it slightly sweet.

144
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:25,842
The pomegranate is very refreshing.

145
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:28,981
That's why he said women liked it. It's refreshing.

146
00:06:28,982 --> 00:06:32,682
(A bite of raw fish noodles with pomegranate vinegar gochujang)

147
00:06:33,052 --> 00:06:34,212
It's closer to being sweet...

148
00:06:34,822 --> 00:06:36,082
than sour.

149
00:06:37,852 --> 00:06:42,822
(Si Yang also tries the broth.)

150
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:45,932
After the sweet and sour taste,

151
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:48,902
the anchovy broth wraps the palate nicely at the end.

152
00:06:49,832 --> 00:06:51,402
It's like rinsing your palate...

153
00:06:51,572 --> 00:06:54,402
with fishcake broth after eating tteokbokki.

154
00:06:55,342 --> 00:06:56,472
It's nice and clean.

155
00:06:56,912 --> 00:06:59,512
(This is good.)

156
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:04,082
- I'm full now. - This was nice.

157
00:07:04,512 --> 00:07:06,072
You sound like you're about to go home.

158
00:07:07,582 --> 00:07:08,921
You have to stay until tomorrow.

159
00:07:08,922 --> 00:07:11,021
- No way. - See if my prediction is right.

160
00:07:11,022 --> 00:07:12,421
We'll find out later.

161
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:14,692
(Will Yi Kyung's prediction come true?)

162
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,691
While you stay seated, I'll give you the quiz.

163
00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:17,832
Right away? That's good.

164
00:07:18,132 --> 00:07:19,732
- Here's the quiz. - Okay.

165
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:22,961
Noodles are a common dish.

166
00:07:22,962 --> 00:07:25,272
As such, they're often referred to in proverbs.

167
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:29,102
"Like a vinegar bottle at a noodle restaurant."

168
00:07:29,372 --> 00:07:31,042
What does the proverb mean?

169
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:35,812
(They're at a loss already.)

170
00:07:37,012 --> 00:07:38,852
"Like a vinegar bottle..."

171
00:07:39,082 --> 00:07:40,552
"at a noodle restaurant?"

172
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:42,822
(I know!)

173
00:07:43,152 --> 00:07:44,222
What about this?

174
00:07:44,522 --> 00:07:47,192
A vinegar bottle has...

175
00:07:47,992 --> 00:07:50,692
a small opening with a bigger body.

176
00:07:51,492 --> 00:07:54,101
A small amount of noodles...

177
00:07:54,102 --> 00:07:55,861
can make you very full.

178
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:56,901
(Like noodles that fill the stomach)

179
00:07:56,902 --> 00:07:59,301
Maybe that's why they're compared to vinegar bottles.

180
00:07:59,302 --> 00:08:00,378
(Does it mean the state of fullness like a vinegar bottle?)

181
00:08:00,402 --> 00:08:01,741
Here's my thought.

182
00:08:01,742 --> 00:08:05,042
It's a noodle restaurant, not a naengmyeon restaurant.

183
00:08:05,642 --> 00:08:07,542
Maybe it means something that doesn't match...

184
00:08:07,842 --> 00:08:09,042
and useless.

185
00:08:09,212 --> 00:08:10,381
That's what I thought.

186
00:08:10,382 --> 00:08:13,211
Either the proverb means something that's useless.

187
00:08:13,212 --> 00:08:14,782
Another meaning could be...

188
00:08:15,882 --> 00:08:18,651
something that adds flavor.

189
00:08:18,652 --> 00:08:19,921
Maybe that's what it means.

190
00:08:19,922 --> 00:08:23,492
I've never seen vinegar at a noodle restaurant.

191
00:08:23,732 --> 00:08:25,561
Let's take a look around us.

192
00:08:25,562 --> 00:08:27,201
We're at a noodle restaurant, and there's no vinegar.

193
00:08:27,202 --> 00:08:28,761
(There's no vinegar bottle on any table.)

194
00:08:28,762 --> 00:08:30,162
Sir, you don't use vinegar, do you?

195
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,501
- I do. - Okay, thank you.

196
00:08:32,502 --> 00:08:33,841
(Embarrassed)

197
00:08:33,842 --> 00:08:34,842
I guess he does.

198
00:08:34,843 --> 00:08:38,012
Sir, when do you add vinegar?

199
00:08:38,572 --> 00:08:39,941
There isn't any on the table.

200
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:41,481
I use it only when I make vinegar gochujang.

201
00:08:41,482 --> 00:08:42,541
- Is that the only time? - Yes.

202
00:08:42,542 --> 00:08:44,512
You don't add vinegar when you cook noodles?

203
00:08:44,612 --> 00:08:46,011
- No, I don't. - Right.

204
00:08:46,012 --> 00:08:47,682
- What I mean is... - However,

205
00:08:47,822 --> 00:08:50,651
raw fish noodles are made with vinegar gochujang.

206
00:08:50,652 --> 00:08:53,791
For ordinary noodle dishes like noodles in kimchi broth,

207
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:55,721
vinegar gochujang needs to be passed around.

208
00:08:55,722 --> 00:08:57,431
It should be placed on the table...

209
00:08:57,432 --> 00:08:59,231
so that anyone can take it.

210
00:08:59,232 --> 00:09:01,732
However, I don't keep it on the table at my restaurant.

211
00:09:02,462 --> 00:09:03,572
Right.

212
00:09:03,832 --> 00:09:05,101
It's not kept on the table.

213
00:09:05,102 --> 00:09:07,042
The restaurant owner just said...

214
00:09:08,372 --> 00:09:10,312
that it gets passed around.

215
00:09:10,912 --> 00:09:12,042
It gets passed around?

216
00:09:12,612 --> 00:09:14,612
- You mean, the vinegar? - He just said it.

217
00:09:15,282 --> 00:09:16,881
It goes from table to table.

218
00:09:16,882 --> 00:09:18,058
(Listening to the restaurant owner meticulously)

219
00:09:18,082 --> 00:09:19,881
Maybe noodle restaurants had vinegar in the past.

220
00:09:19,882 --> 00:09:21,052
That sounds reasonable too.

221
00:09:21,152 --> 00:09:24,752
What's important to think about is whether there's vinegar...

222
00:09:25,292 --> 00:09:28,921
on the table at a regular noodle restaurant.

223
00:09:28,922 --> 00:09:30,292
If yes, that meaning is right.

224
00:09:30,462 --> 00:09:33,062
These days, most noodle restaurants...

225
00:09:33,092 --> 00:09:34,501
don't have vinegar.

226
00:09:34,502 --> 00:09:36,061
- They have sauces like soy sauce. - Right.

227
00:09:36,062 --> 00:09:37,272
They have sauces instead.

228
00:09:37,772 --> 00:09:39,432
You say to someone,

229
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:42,542
"You're like a vinegar bottle at a noodle restaurant."

230
00:09:42,742 --> 00:09:45,372
In what situation was this proverb used?

231
00:09:46,172 --> 00:09:48,442
It doesn't seem suitable.

232
00:09:48,812 --> 00:09:51,282
It could mean something that's not suitable.

233
00:09:51,352 --> 00:09:53,151
It doesn't suit one's behavior.

234
00:09:53,152 --> 00:09:55,152
It could mean something that's not suitable.

235
00:09:55,652 --> 00:09:56,852
Or something that's flavorful.

236
00:09:56,952 --> 00:09:59,121
Do we have any other ideas?

237
00:09:59,122 --> 00:10:00,521
I don't think it means something flavorful.

238
00:10:00,522 --> 00:10:02,322
Then let's go with that answer.

239
00:10:02,892 --> 00:10:04,332
Okay, can you organize our thoughts?

240
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,031
- It isn't suitable? - It isn't suitable.

241
00:10:06,032 --> 00:10:08,101
It's random and not suitable.

242
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:09,201
- That should be enough. - Yes.

243
00:10:09,202 --> 00:10:10,302
It sounds comprehensive.

244
00:10:10,432 --> 00:10:13,302
It means someone who doesn't fit and who is random?

245
00:10:13,702 --> 00:10:15,172
Yes, generally speaking.

246
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:19,312
(They made a guess while thinking about the past.)

247
00:10:20,012 --> 00:10:21,981
(It means someone who doesn't fit and who is random.)

248
00:10:21,982 --> 00:10:23,182
Incorrect.

249
00:10:24,212 --> 00:10:25,912
Is it related to being full?

250
00:10:26,282 --> 00:10:28,151
- No. - That's not it either?

251
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:30,181
- Do you have a reattempt card? - No.

252
00:10:30,182 --> 00:10:31,792
Then I'll explain the answer.

253
00:10:32,522 --> 00:10:35,062
"Like a vinegar bottle at a noodle restaurant..."

254
00:10:35,692 --> 00:10:39,691
refers to someone who's busy moving...

255
00:10:39,692 --> 00:10:40,801
from one place to another.

256
00:10:40,802 --> 00:10:42,961
(A very appropriate example of the situation)

257
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:45,372
(Vinegar bottle)

258
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:47,842
The restaurant owner gave us a hint.

259
00:10:48,172 --> 00:10:51,212
It meant the sauce that gets passed around.

260
00:10:51,512 --> 00:10:53,272
Today, the quizzes are...

261
00:10:53,572 --> 00:10:54,582
difficult.

262
00:10:54,642 --> 00:10:56,722
Now that we have more time, shall we go to Yangyang?

263
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:59,811
I think our best option now is...

264
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:01,021
- going to Goseong. - Right.

265
00:11:01,022 --> 00:11:03,321
- We must block their bingo. - After that,

266
00:11:03,322 --> 00:11:06,222
if the alarm doesn't go off for Gangneung A,

267
00:11:06,522 --> 00:11:08,161
- we can go there. - Yes.

268
00:11:08,162 --> 00:11:09,591
Then we'll steal their bingo.

269
00:11:09,592 --> 00:11:10,632
Exactly.

270
00:11:10,792 --> 00:11:12,531
- Let's hurry and go to Goseong. - Let's go.

271
00:11:12,532 --> 00:11:13,762
Jegal Seung Ho says,

272
00:11:14,062 --> 00:11:15,501
"Go to Goseong!"

273
00:11:15,502 --> 00:11:18,671
- Either way... - When we're in Goseong,

274
00:11:18,672 --> 00:11:20,331
let's hope their alarm won't go off for Gangneung A.

275
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:21,442
Okay, that sounds good.

276
00:11:22,172 --> 00:11:24,372
We're like a vinegar bottle at a noodle restaurant.

277
00:11:24,812 --> 00:11:26,948
I'm sorry for not getting it right even though you gave us a hint.

278
00:11:26,972 --> 00:11:30,481
The answer was in your explanation that I'm grateful for,

279
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,512
but we failed to answer correctly.

280
00:11:32,552 --> 00:11:34,722
If the other team comes here,

281
00:11:34,782 --> 00:11:36,721
please don't explain to them about the vinegar.

282
00:11:36,722 --> 00:11:38,091
(Explaining about the vinegar is prohibited.)

283
00:11:38,092 --> 00:11:40,151
- Please, I beg you. - Sure, I won't tell them.

284
00:11:40,152 --> 00:11:41,361
Okay.

285
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:42,362
- Thank you. - Thank you.

286
00:11:42,363 --> 00:11:43,891
- Please stay healthy. - Thank you.

287
00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:44,992
Thank you.

288
00:11:45,032 --> 00:11:46,361
- Thank you very much. - You're welcome.

289
00:11:46,362 --> 00:11:47,602
- Thank you. - Good job.

290
00:11:47,802 --> 00:11:48,802
What a bummer.

291
00:11:49,832 --> 00:11:52,002
(Team Guys)

292
00:11:52,632 --> 00:11:54,842
Their alarm hasn't gone off yet, has it?

293
00:11:55,442 --> 00:11:58,172
(Sung Hoon, on the other hand)

294
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:02,242
(Sleeping deeply while snoring)

295
00:12:04,352 --> 00:12:07,251
We should have gone to Gangneung first...

296
00:12:07,252 --> 00:12:08,381
for jang kalguksu.

297
00:12:08,382 --> 00:12:09,728
(The conversation wakes up Sung Hoon.)

298
00:12:09,752 --> 00:12:10,891
We have to go there anyway.

299
00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:12,722
If they aren't in Gangneung A,

300
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:14,921
it'd mean that they aren't after the bingo.

301
00:12:14,922 --> 00:12:15,922
(Blinking)

302
00:12:16,122 --> 00:12:17,531
(They feel refreshed after the 30-minute nap.)

303
00:12:17,532 --> 00:12:18,631
I slept well.

304
00:12:18,632 --> 00:12:21,132
I was in a deep sleep for 15 minutes.

305
00:12:22,062 --> 00:12:23,332
Where are we going now?

306
00:12:23,532 --> 00:12:25,892
We're going to eat jang kalguksu. You got some rest, right?

307
00:12:26,132 --> 00:12:27,772
We even exercised. Aren't you hungry?

308
00:12:28,142 --> 00:12:29,571
Are you feeling better now?

309
00:12:29,572 --> 00:12:31,271
(They go to eat again after exercising and sleeping.)

310
00:12:31,272 --> 00:12:32,542
It's just...

311
00:12:33,472 --> 00:12:34,711
It's time to leave.

312
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,952
(Shall I get up?)

313
00:12:39,152 --> 00:12:40,252
My neck hurts.

314
00:12:40,822 --> 00:12:42,021
That was good.

315
00:12:42,022 --> 00:12:43,722
(All members of Team Guys got up.)

316
00:12:43,852 --> 00:12:45,451
We're heading for jang kalguksu.

317
00:12:45,452 --> 00:12:46,522
Okay.

318
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:49,321
After winning Jeongseon,

319
00:12:49,322 --> 00:12:52,962
if they turned off the alarm as their wish,

320
00:12:53,162 --> 00:12:55,661
wouldn't they have gone to Sokcho after stopping by Gangneung?

321
00:12:55,662 --> 00:12:57,002
Definitely.

322
00:12:57,302 --> 00:12:59,832
If we find out at the jang kalguksu restaurant...

323
00:12:59,872 --> 00:13:02,442
that they succeeded, it'll be a variable to consider.

324
00:13:02,742 --> 00:13:05,172
If that's not the case,

325
00:13:06,012 --> 00:13:09,112
what have they been doing today? What are they up to?

326
00:13:09,742 --> 00:13:10,942
Did they get into an accident?

327
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:12,452
I hope that they aren't there.

328
00:13:12,752 --> 00:13:13,752
Please.

329
00:13:14,022 --> 00:13:16,122
Getting the quiz right...

330
00:13:16,382 --> 00:13:17,951
and going sledding would be perfect.

331
00:13:17,952 --> 00:13:20,521
- That'd be nice. - Sledding sounds fun.

332
00:13:20,522 --> 00:13:21,561
(They still dream of sledding at the end.)

333
00:13:21,562 --> 00:13:23,891
There must be specific hours for sledding.

334
00:13:23,892 --> 00:13:24,962
Right.

335
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,902
- There's a sign for kalguksu. - Is this it?

336
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:31,001
Here's the kalguksu restaurant.

337
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:34,041
You can tell that it's an old restaurant.

338
00:13:34,042 --> 00:13:36,002
It looks very old.

339
00:13:37,712 --> 00:13:39,041
It's an old restaurant.

340
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:41,181
(There's the vibe of an old restaurant inside.)

341
00:13:41,182 --> 00:13:43,242
Hello. We sit on the floor.

342
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:44,712
Do we take off our shoes?

343
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:47,621
This is great. Goodness.

344
00:13:47,622 --> 00:13:50,622
(Gangneung A: Jang kalguksu)

345
00:13:50,922 --> 00:13:53,592
Gosh, at this place...

346
00:13:54,262 --> 00:13:56,422
There must be more than one on the menu.

347
00:13:57,122 --> 00:13:58,891
The place is very small.

348
00:13:58,892 --> 00:14:00,168
(For a tasty restaurant, it's small.)

349
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:01,602
There must be an annex somewhere.

350
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:04,272
Right. This isn't the only space, is it?

351
00:14:04,372 --> 00:14:06,172
There has to be another space.

352
00:14:06,502 --> 00:14:09,571
- Hello. - Hello.

353
00:14:09,572 --> 00:14:11,111
Nice to meet you.

354
00:14:11,112 --> 00:14:12,992
(At that moment, the restaurant owner arrives.)

355
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:15,611
Ma'am, is this the entire restaurant?

356
00:14:15,612 --> 00:14:17,751
- What do you mean? - Is there an annex?

357
00:14:17,752 --> 00:14:20,781
We have three rooms and the living room.

358
00:14:20,782 --> 00:14:22,051
- Really? - Yes.

359
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:23,052
(This is the only restaurant.)

360
00:14:23,053 --> 00:14:25,621
When did you start the restaurant? It's very old...

361
00:14:25,622 --> 00:14:27,291
It's been 42 years.

362
00:14:27,292 --> 00:14:28,792
- Forty-two years? - Yes.

363
00:14:28,992 --> 00:14:30,931
- Was it handed down to you? - Yes.

364
00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:34,832
My mom and I opened the restaurant together.

365
00:14:36,332 --> 00:14:37,701
It's been 42 years.

366
00:14:37,702 --> 00:14:40,472
(Handsome Noodle Road 6, the taste of 42 years)

367
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:43,771
That's incredible. I see.

368
00:14:43,772 --> 00:14:46,472
I can't wait to try it. Thank you.

369
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:49,411
- Forty-two years? - Shall we order?

370
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:50,481
What should we order?

371
00:14:50,482 --> 00:14:53,712
- There's only one on the menu. - We only make kalguksu.

372
00:14:54,482 --> 00:14:55,722
There's only one.

373
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:57,691
Which flavor would you like?

374
00:14:57,692 --> 00:15:00,691
Can we get 1 regular spicy and 1 non-spicy?

375
00:15:00,692 --> 00:15:03,391
Regular spicy is spicy like Buldak Ramyeon.

376
00:15:03,392 --> 00:15:04,591
(Regular spicy is as spicy as Buldak Ramyeon.)

377
00:15:04,592 --> 00:15:07,932
Non-spicy one is as spicy as regular ramyeon.

378
00:15:08,132 --> 00:15:10,201
- Instead of regular spicy, - Yes?

379
00:15:10,202 --> 00:15:12,371
Can we get 1 medium spicy and 1 non-spicy?

380
00:15:12,372 --> 00:15:13,801
- Okay. - You think it'd be too spicy?

381
00:15:13,802 --> 00:15:17,941
- I'll bring 1 regular, 1 medium, - Okay.

382
00:15:17,942 --> 00:15:20,041
- and one not spicy. - Okay.

383
00:15:20,042 --> 00:15:21,718
- Let's try a little bit of each. - All right.

384
00:15:21,742 --> 00:15:22,841
This could be our last dish.

385
00:15:22,842 --> 00:15:25,051
This is our last one, so let's eat before we leave.

386
00:15:25,052 --> 00:15:26,211
(Their last feast before the victory)

387
00:15:26,212 --> 00:15:28,382
- It's our last meal. - Last meal?

388
00:15:28,922 --> 00:15:31,522
(While they wait for jang kalguksu)

389
00:15:31,752 --> 00:15:33,392
How is this possible?

390
00:15:33,792 --> 00:15:35,991
The alarm will go off at least once, won't it?

391
00:15:35,992 --> 00:15:37,491
More importantly,

392
00:15:37,492 --> 00:15:39,591
they can't get bingo because we blocked all possibilities.

393
00:15:39,592 --> 00:15:40,801
There's no possible bingo for them...

394
00:15:40,802 --> 00:15:42,332
because we're here.

395
00:15:42,702 --> 00:15:44,071
The fact that we're here...

396
00:15:44,072 --> 00:15:45,902
means that they got it wrong.

397
00:15:46,172 --> 00:15:47,501
- Right. - Even if they came here.

398
00:15:47,502 --> 00:15:49,472
Does it mean that they've only been failing?

399
00:15:50,042 --> 00:15:52,941
- That's impossible. - That doesn't make sense.

400
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:55,682
I'm so curious what they wished for.

401
00:15:55,742 --> 00:15:56,742
I know.

402
00:15:57,212 --> 00:15:59,312
They have such an amazing card.

403
00:15:59,812 --> 00:16:01,421
What's going on here?

404
00:16:01,422 --> 00:16:03,022
(At that time, jang kalguksu is served.)

405
00:16:03,352 --> 00:16:04,621
(His eyes are fixed on it.)

406
00:16:04,622 --> 00:16:06,352
This must be the spicy one.

407
00:16:06,692 --> 00:16:08,491
- The color is different. - Yes.

408
00:16:08,492 --> 00:16:10,892
- This is the spicy one. - This is non-spicy.

409
00:16:10,962 --> 00:16:12,961
- This is the spiciest. - It's the regular spicy.

410
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:15,101
Regular? I'll try regular spicy.

411
00:16:15,102 --> 00:16:16,362
This is less spicy.

412
00:16:16,702 --> 00:16:18,002
It smells...

413
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:19,671
so good.

414
00:16:19,672 --> 00:16:20,771
The colors are...

415
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:22,371
Ma'am, this is...

416
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:24,071
- Enjoy your food. - Thank you.

417
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:25,312
Thank you for the food.

418
00:16:26,072 --> 00:16:27,781
We should try the regular spicy.

419
00:16:27,782 --> 00:16:29,382
- Is this regular? - Yes.

420
00:16:30,242 --> 00:16:34,382
(Trying the broth first)

421
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:36,222
It's spicy.

422
00:16:37,122 --> 00:16:38,522
This is supposed to be non-spicy.

423
00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:40,862
There must be Cheongyang chili pepper inside.

424
00:16:41,022 --> 00:16:42,191
- Gosh. - I guess so.

425
00:16:42,192 --> 00:16:44,031
- This is quite spicy. - This too.

426
00:16:44,032 --> 00:16:45,508
(The non-spicy one is slightly spicy.)

427
00:16:45,532 --> 00:16:49,932
(Sung Hoon picked regular spicy.)

428
00:16:50,562 --> 00:16:51,802
(Slurping)

429
00:16:55,702 --> 00:16:59,172
(He adds broth to the noodles.)

430
00:16:59,672 --> 00:17:02,842
(Slurping)

431
00:17:03,312 --> 00:17:06,052
(Devouring explosively)

432
00:17:06,212 --> 00:17:07,352
It's good.

433
00:17:08,322 --> 00:17:09,382
(Exhaling)

434
00:17:10,652 --> 00:17:12,552
Sung Hoon, you eat spicy food well.

435
00:17:12,722 --> 00:17:15,761
In Japan, something this spicy is rare.

436
00:17:15,762 --> 00:17:16,922
There are many spicy dishes,

437
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:20,362
but something that's spicy and delicious is rare.

438
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:22,701
You haven't eaten a lot of kalguksu, have you?

439
00:17:22,702 --> 00:17:24,001
- Right. - Jang kalguksu.

440
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:27,331
- Something like udon. - Right.

441
00:17:27,332 --> 00:17:29,372
(Jang kalguksu has a different charm than udon.)

442
00:17:30,942 --> 00:17:32,172
It must be spicy.

443
00:17:32,542 --> 00:17:33,712
No, it's...

444
00:17:34,412 --> 00:17:37,612
(Trying jang kalguksu)

445
00:17:37,982 --> 00:17:38,982
(How about Tae Hyun who ordered not spicy one?)

446
00:17:38,983 --> 00:17:40,112
It's delicious.

447
00:17:40,852 --> 00:17:43,981
(He blows on the hot noodles.)

448
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:45,192
(Slurping)

449
00:17:45,592 --> 00:17:48,261
(Jang kalguksu makes a small eater slurp noodles too.)

450
00:17:48,262 --> 00:17:49,722
The kimchi is tasty too.

451
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:51,992
(Clapping)

452
00:17:52,692 --> 00:17:53,832
It's good.

453
00:17:54,762 --> 00:17:57,702
(Everyone knows Sang Uk as a noodle lover.)

454
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:02,842
(Humming in awe)

455
00:18:04,642 --> 00:18:08,342
(I can't resist the broth.)

456
00:18:08,942 --> 00:18:11,812
Is it because we exercised and slept before eating?

457
00:18:12,112 --> 00:18:14,352
- This is good. - Aren't you a little hungry?

458
00:18:14,882 --> 00:18:16,752
- This is nice. - This is kalguksu.

459
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:19,452
There's no meat in it.

460
00:18:20,422 --> 00:18:22,461
(He's disappointed that there's no protein.)

461
00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:23,942
He said that there was no meat in it.

462
00:18:24,792 --> 00:18:27,331
(Team Guys' last supper is in full swing.)

463
00:18:27,332 --> 00:18:30,202
They only specialize in kalguksu.

464
00:18:30,262 --> 00:18:32,901
(Yes, this is it.)

465
00:18:32,902 --> 00:18:34,172
It's delicious.

466
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:38,572
(Two men with a good mileage slurp noodles side by side.)

467
00:18:40,572 --> 00:18:41,782
(Slurping)

468
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:43,812
(Slurping)

469
00:18:44,182 --> 00:18:49,052
(Even the small eater joins the jang kalguksu eating.)

470
00:18:50,622 --> 00:18:54,721
(Eat...)

471
00:18:54,722 --> 00:19:00,332
(as if today was the last time.)

472
00:19:01,862 --> 00:19:03,632
Gosh, it's amazing.

473
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:05,371
It's very delicious.

474
00:19:05,372 --> 00:19:06,972
(It's very delicious.)

475
00:19:13,172 --> 00:19:17,952
(Even if it's spicy, you must drink the broth too.)

476
00:19:18,252 --> 00:19:21,382
- The name comes from gochujang. - Right.

477
00:19:21,522 --> 00:19:23,852
It's delicious. I like it.

478
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:26,792
This is my first time...

479
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:28,962
eating noodles three times in a day.

480
00:19:29,222 --> 00:19:31,862
(Eating 3 noodle dishes in 1 day is rare.)

481
00:19:32,792 --> 00:19:33,892
We're done.

482
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:35,332
- Are you done? - Yes.

483
00:19:35,362 --> 00:19:37,031
What type of noodle is there in Goseong?

484
00:19:37,032 --> 00:19:38,401
It's dongchimi makguksu.

485
00:19:38,402 --> 00:19:39,472
That sounds good.

486
00:19:39,572 --> 00:19:41,072
Dongchimi helps...

487
00:19:41,372 --> 00:19:43,642
- with digestion. - That's right.

488
00:19:44,672 --> 00:19:45,771
(Yawning)

489
00:19:45,772 --> 00:19:48,512
Yi Kyung, you gave me too much noodles.

490
00:19:49,812 --> 00:19:51,952
You're a big eater. You eat so well.

491
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:54,952
I'm falling into a food coma.

492
00:19:56,152 --> 00:19:58,022
- Aren't you full and sleepy? - Yes.

493
00:19:58,222 --> 00:19:59,651
In order to use our brains,

494
00:19:59,652 --> 00:20:02,321
- we must eat carbohydrates. - Good.

495
00:20:02,322 --> 00:20:04,891
When we get there, let's order one dish and share it.

496
00:20:04,892 --> 00:20:06,492
We'll finish it neatly.

497
00:20:07,232 --> 00:20:08,601
We're almost there.

498
00:20:08,602 --> 00:20:09,761
(They arrived at the makguksu restaurant before digesting.)

499
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:11,072
The noodles...

500
00:20:11,772 --> 00:20:13,702
Is there perilla seed makguksu?

501
00:20:14,572 --> 00:20:16,402
No, Seung Ho. That's enough.

502
00:20:16,742 --> 00:20:18,041
Stop it. You've done enough.

503
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:19,542
(He's fighting against himself.)

504
00:20:20,112 --> 00:20:21,382
Hello.

505
00:20:21,482 --> 00:20:22,841
- Hello. - Hello.

506
00:20:22,842 --> 00:20:24,458
(Noodle Road 7, Noodles fallen in refreshing dongchimi)

507
00:20:24,482 --> 00:20:25,812
You want one bowl, don't you?

508
00:20:26,012 --> 00:20:28,151
- I can still eat. - Really?

509
00:20:28,152 --> 00:20:30,282
Si Yang can get a bowl. Do you want to share one?

510
00:20:30,352 --> 00:20:31,752
Just order one.

511
00:20:32,392 --> 00:20:33,891
Excuse me, sir.

512
00:20:33,892 --> 00:20:36,661
We had three meals before coming here.

513
00:20:36,662 --> 00:20:39,131
There are 3 of us, but can we just get 1 order?

514
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:41,331
- That's fine. - For makguksu...

515
00:20:41,332 --> 00:20:42,801
One dongchimi makguksu, please.

516
00:20:42,802 --> 00:20:44,531
- Would you like dongchimi makguksu? - Yes.

517
00:20:44,532 --> 00:20:46,771
Sir, there's suyuk on the menu.

518
00:20:46,772 --> 00:20:48,272
(Seung Ho with an appetite)

519
00:20:48,472 --> 00:20:49,641
No, never mind.

520
00:20:49,642 --> 00:20:52,211
- Go ahead and get it. - For now, let's not lose hope.

521
00:20:52,212 --> 00:20:54,281
Let's not reduce the possibility of our winning.

522
00:20:54,282 --> 00:20:55,481
- Can we get an order of suyuk? - I'll resist.

523
00:20:55,482 --> 00:20:57,411
No, sir. We'll get one makguksu.

524
00:20:57,412 --> 00:20:59,111
- He wants some, so we'll get it. - In that case,

525
00:20:59,112 --> 00:21:00,781
please bring us an order.

526
00:21:00,782 --> 00:21:02,481
- Make it refreshing. - Can we get a small size?

527
00:21:02,482 --> 00:21:04,592
- A small size? - Yes, a small size.

528
00:21:04,622 --> 00:21:07,122
We still have hope, so this should be fine.

529
00:21:07,792 --> 00:21:09,191
- We have hope. - Let's say...

530
00:21:09,192 --> 00:21:12,061
that the other team failed to win jang kalguksu.

531
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,061
If we succeed in Goseong,

532
00:21:14,062 --> 00:21:16,631
we'll have a higher chance of winning.

533
00:21:16,632 --> 00:21:18,232
- If they get the wrong answer. - Right.

534
00:21:18,702 --> 00:21:19,872
The food is here already.

535
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,042
Here's your food.

536
00:21:24,612 --> 00:21:26,841
(Suyuk appears.)

537
00:21:26,842 --> 00:21:29,242
It would have been sad not to order it.

538
00:21:30,112 --> 00:21:33,482
- Did you scorch it with a torch? - Yes, I did.

539
00:21:33,712 --> 00:21:36,151
After boiling the meat,

540
00:21:36,152 --> 00:21:39,251
we grill it by applying heat directly.

541
00:21:39,252 --> 00:21:43,122
It's to make the suyuk juicier.

542
00:21:43,362 --> 00:21:44,892
(Amazed)

543
00:21:44,932 --> 00:21:46,591
Sir, is this pollack?

544
00:21:46,592 --> 00:21:48,232
Yes, it's seasoned raw pollack.

545
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,061
This is the sauce.

546
00:21:50,062 --> 00:21:52,382
(Seasoned raw pollack to make the makguksu more flavorful)

547
00:21:52,432 --> 00:21:53,931
(Main noodles in Goseong, dongchimi makguksu)

548
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:55,642
- That's okay. - It's okay.

549
00:21:56,372 --> 00:21:57,641
Is there a secret way to enjoy it?

550
00:21:57,642 --> 00:21:59,542
For example, how much sauce should we put in?

551
00:22:00,142 --> 00:22:03,811
How to enjoy it is written on the wall.

552
00:22:03,812 --> 00:22:05,888
Three scoops of dongchimi, a little bit of perilla oil...

553
00:22:05,912 --> 00:22:07,052
Okay.

554
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:12,552
(Add 3 scoops of refreshing dongchimi full of ice)

555
00:22:13,952 --> 00:22:16,221
(With savory perilla oil)

556
00:22:16,222 --> 00:22:18,362
- Shall I try it? - Perilla oil.

557
00:22:18,492 --> 00:22:19,831
One.

558
00:22:19,832 --> 00:22:20,832
(Here comes one scoop.)

559
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,061
I don't like to ruin the shape of dried laver,

560
00:22:23,062 --> 00:22:24,862
- so I'll pour it on the side. - That's good.

561
00:22:25,172 --> 00:22:27,102
It's done by a front-grabber.

562
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,372
Do you know what front-grabber means?

563
00:22:30,642 --> 00:22:31,841
A front-grabber is...

564
00:22:31,842 --> 00:22:34,981
The person who makes a ball of noodles and serves it.

565
00:22:34,982 --> 00:22:35,982
Right.

566
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:37,212
This is...

567
00:22:37,612 --> 00:22:38,712
A bit of perilla oil.

568
00:22:39,282 --> 00:22:41,821
(Pouring as much perilla oil as he wants)

569
00:22:41,822 --> 00:22:43,451
We have some sauce. Shall I add it later?

570
00:22:43,452 --> 00:22:44,951
- First, let's try as is. - Okay.

571
00:22:44,952 --> 00:22:46,051
I'll spread out the laver flakes.

572
00:22:46,052 --> 00:22:47,492
All right. Open it up.

573
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:49,091
Like this.

574
00:22:49,092 --> 00:22:50,261
Shall we open it?

575
00:22:50,262 --> 00:22:53,292
(Spreading out the noodles in the dongchimi broth)

576
00:22:53,432 --> 00:22:55,562
(His mouth is watering again.)

577
00:22:55,802 --> 00:22:57,402
Guys, try some.

578
00:22:58,372 --> 00:22:59,601
I'll serve you again.

579
00:22:59,602 --> 00:23:00,631
(The eldest first)

580
00:23:00,632 --> 00:23:02,201
(A huge amount)

581
00:23:02,202 --> 00:23:04,141
- I'll serve myself. - Okay.

582
00:23:04,142 --> 00:23:05,872
Instead of fighting, how about this?

583
00:23:05,942 --> 00:23:06,942
All right.

584
00:23:06,943 --> 00:23:09,312
- One, two. - Noodles shouldn't be cut.

585
00:23:09,712 --> 00:23:10,941
That works.

586
00:23:10,942 --> 00:23:13,282
- I'll take this much. - Okay.

587
00:23:13,982 --> 00:23:17,682
Now, we're giving more food to each other.

588
00:23:18,492 --> 00:23:20,121
Like this.

589
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:21,562
(They finish distributing the food.)

590
00:23:21,862 --> 00:23:24,221
From Seoul to Jeongseon to Goseong.

591
00:23:24,222 --> 00:23:25,862
(A bite of refreshing dongchimi makguksu)

592
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:28,702
(Humming)

593
00:23:30,232 --> 00:23:31,932
When you eat the noodles,

594
00:23:31,972 --> 00:23:34,901
eat them with seasoned raw pollack.

595
00:23:34,902 --> 00:23:36,672
- It will be more delicious. - This?

596
00:23:39,072 --> 00:23:41,912
Generally, it's well seasoned and savory.

597
00:23:45,512 --> 00:23:48,622
(Adding the flavor of seasoned raw pollack to the savory taste)

598
00:23:51,322 --> 00:23:52,592
It's delicious.

599
00:23:54,352 --> 00:23:55,922
(Flavorful)

600
00:23:56,722 --> 00:23:59,592
(Wrapping seasoned raw pollack with makguksu)

601
00:24:01,092 --> 00:24:02,632
(Slurping)

602
00:24:06,232 --> 00:24:08,042
(Eating suyuk first)

603
00:24:09,142 --> 00:24:10,342
It's delicious.

604
00:24:10,642 --> 00:24:11,972
(Surprised)

605
00:24:12,712 --> 00:24:15,782
Yi Kyung, try a piece right now.

606
00:24:16,112 --> 00:24:17,112
Please.

607
00:24:17,482 --> 00:24:18,752
- Is it good? - Seriously.

608
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,852
- Just a piece. - A piece?

609
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,522
- It tastes like jokbal. - Yes.

610
00:24:24,892 --> 00:24:27,791
(Recommended by Seung Ho, he tries a bite.)

611
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:29,492
(His eyes widened.)

612
00:24:29,592 --> 00:24:31,661
I'm so glad that we ordered it.

613
00:24:31,662 --> 00:24:32,832
It's very delicious.

614
00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:36,231
Instead of being like suyuk that we know,

615
00:24:36,232 --> 00:24:38,902
it tastes closer to jokbal as you said.

616
00:24:40,532 --> 00:24:42,642
(This is it.)

617
00:24:43,772 --> 00:24:45,341
(Exclaiming)

618
00:24:45,342 --> 00:24:47,142
The fatty part is to die for.

619
00:24:47,942 --> 00:24:49,112
It's delicious.

620
00:24:49,312 --> 00:24:50,741
It's not like suyuk that we imagine.

621
00:24:50,742 --> 00:24:52,481
It's in between bossam...

622
00:24:52,482 --> 00:24:54,182
- and jokbal. - Yes, that's right.

623
00:24:54,252 --> 00:24:55,322
It has it all.

624
00:24:55,852 --> 00:24:57,221
You're good at describing the taste.

625
00:24:57,222 --> 00:24:59,351
(Its tender and chewy taste is excellent.)

626
00:24:59,352 --> 00:25:01,391
Goodness. I'm so full,

627
00:25:01,392 --> 00:25:02,562
but I can still eat.

628
00:25:04,492 --> 00:25:05,692
That's so delicious.

629
00:25:06,732 --> 00:25:07,932
You don't crave churros...

630
00:25:08,002 --> 00:25:09,901
when you're outside.

631
00:25:09,902 --> 00:25:11,462
It tasted so good when I ate it inside.

632
00:25:12,532 --> 00:25:14,542
(Cuckoo)

633
00:25:15,102 --> 00:25:16,172
What?

634
00:25:16,535 --> 00:25:18,635
(Cuckoo)

635
00:25:19,065 --> 00:25:21,064
- What? - Did you hear the cuckoo sound?

636
00:25:21,065 --> 00:25:22,434
It came from over there.

637
00:25:22,435 --> 00:25:23,734
It didn't go off here.

638
00:25:23,735 --> 00:25:24,804
It was on TV.

639
00:25:24,805 --> 00:25:25,874
That startled me.

640
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:28,375
(Surprised whenever he hears the cuckoo sound)

641
00:25:28,645 --> 00:25:30,375
Director, just give us the quiz.

642
00:25:30,675 --> 00:25:32,614
- We'll do it while eating. - Shall we do it while eating?

643
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:33,714
Shall we?

644
00:25:33,715 --> 00:25:34,855
You may go in.

645
00:25:36,385 --> 00:25:37,454
(Staff members come in to eat.)

646
00:25:37,455 --> 00:25:40,585
They're the ones responsible for our safety.

647
00:25:41,285 --> 00:25:44,055
- Can they get food? - Please serve them food now.

648
00:25:45,965 --> 00:25:48,035
(Checking the staff members' meal for no reason)

649
00:25:48,495 --> 00:25:50,334
(Could it be related to the quiz?)

650
00:25:50,335 --> 00:25:51,704
- I'm full. - Why is he filming?

651
00:25:51,705 --> 00:25:53,264
We're getting doubtful.

652
00:25:53,265 --> 00:25:56,075
Right, the unusual behavior made him suspicious.

653
00:25:56,775 --> 00:25:58,775
- It's not related to the quiz. - Something is up.

654
00:25:59,305 --> 00:26:00,944
Here's the quiz.

655
00:26:00,945 --> 00:26:02,115
Okay, let's do it.

656
00:26:02,915 --> 00:26:06,715
In 1 of the top 3 Korean recipe books in the modern times...

657
00:26:07,085 --> 00:26:10,955
called "New Unparalleled Recipes of Korean Cuisine,"

658
00:26:11,115 --> 00:26:13,624
there's a unique dongchimi recipe.

659
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:16,955
It's slightly different from today's dongchimi recipe.

660
00:26:17,455 --> 00:26:19,095
"Once it's aged, before eating,"

661
00:26:19,195 --> 00:26:21,695
"add sliced pears and citron."

662
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:24,735
"It's very good to add..."

663
00:26:25,205 --> 00:26:26,904
"pomegranate and silbaek in the broth."

664
00:26:26,905 --> 00:26:28,874
- Pomegranate and silbaek? - That's how it's recorded.

665
00:26:28,875 --> 00:26:30,605
- Silbaek? - Silbaek.

666
00:26:31,335 --> 00:26:33,645
What is silbaek?

667
00:26:34,245 --> 00:26:35,615
- Silbaek? - Silbaek.

668
00:26:36,075 --> 00:26:37,974
First of all, here's what I think.

669
00:26:37,975 --> 00:26:40,484
Dongchimi is clear.

670
00:26:40,485 --> 00:26:43,485
What are the usual ingredients? There's radish.

671
00:26:44,085 --> 00:26:46,484
Then it's decorated at the end.

672
00:26:46,485 --> 00:26:48,294
To adjust the spiciness,

673
00:26:48,295 --> 00:26:51,355
either red peppers or regular peppers are used.

674
00:26:51,825 --> 00:26:54,735
To present dongchimi nicely,

675
00:26:55,465 --> 00:26:57,435
pine nuts would be added.

676
00:26:58,565 --> 00:27:00,304
He said that the recipe was different from now.

677
00:27:00,305 --> 00:27:01,574
(However, it's different from how it's made now?)

678
00:27:01,575 --> 00:27:03,434
I don't know if the answer is in the problem.

679
00:27:03,435 --> 00:27:04,634
Today, there was no answer...

680
00:27:04,635 --> 00:27:06,044
- The question is very hard. - in the problem.

681
00:27:06,045 --> 00:27:07,521
(Flustered by questions harder than usual)

682
00:27:07,545 --> 00:27:09,175
Silbaek that goes well with pomegranate?

683
00:27:09,845 --> 00:27:10,875
Silbaek.

684
00:27:11,115 --> 00:27:14,685
Usually, fancy sujeonggwa has...

685
00:27:15,055 --> 00:27:16,684
dried dates.

686
00:27:16,685 --> 00:27:19,425
- Right. - Julienned dates are added.

687
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:21,625
Usually, pine nuts are added too.

688
00:27:22,055 --> 00:27:23,224
It's something that floats.

689
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,025
- It doesn't sink. - Could it be pine nuts?

690
00:27:25,425 --> 00:27:26,664
I think it's pine nuts.

691
00:27:26,665 --> 00:27:28,934
As soon as I heard the question, I thought of pine nuts.

692
00:27:28,935 --> 00:27:30,964
However, I don't see how it's related to silbaek.

693
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:33,005
When pine nuts are peeled, they're white.

694
00:27:34,005 --> 00:27:35,005
What?

695
00:27:35,006 --> 00:27:37,134
- What does "baek" mean? - Baek.

696
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:39,175
So I think the answer could be pine nuts.

697
00:27:39,575 --> 00:27:40,844
All of us think that it's pine nuts.

698
00:27:40,845 --> 00:27:41,914
(They agree on the same answer.)

699
00:27:41,915 --> 00:27:45,245
Instead of wasting time and getting the quiz wrong again,

700
00:27:45,445 --> 00:27:47,014
it might be better to get to Yangyang.

701
00:27:47,015 --> 00:27:49,155
- I really want to get it right. - Yi Kyung.

702
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:51,215
Let's just go with pine nuts.

703
00:27:51,685 --> 00:27:52,884
Let's go with pine nuts.

704
00:27:52,885 --> 00:27:54,024
- Really? - Yes.

705
00:27:54,025 --> 00:27:55,554
- One, two, three. Pine nuts. - Two, three. Pine nuts.

706
00:27:55,555 --> 00:27:56,855
Why didn't you shout it out?

707
00:27:57,355 --> 00:27:58,564
Do you think that it's wrong?

708
00:27:58,565 --> 00:28:00,094
- What else do you think... - Let's go with it.

709
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,424
- Okay, we can do it. - Let's go.

710
00:28:01,425 --> 00:28:02,734
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

711
00:28:02,735 --> 00:28:03,735
- Pine nuts. - Pine nuts.

712
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,204
Silbaek refers to pine nuts?

713
00:28:06,205 --> 00:28:08,575
(Is pine nuts that they shouted confidently the answer?)

714
00:28:09,275 --> 00:28:11,004
(Answer: Silbaek refers to pine nuts.)

715
00:28:11,005 --> 00:28:12,045
Correct.

716
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:15,745
Why does silbaek mean pine nuts?

717
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:17,644
What you said was accurate.

718
00:28:17,645 --> 00:28:19,784
When pine nuts are peeled and become white,

719
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:21,655
they're called silbaek.

720
00:28:21,815 --> 00:28:22,815
(I was right.)
By the way...

721
00:28:23,816 --> 00:28:26,224
"Sil" means fruit.

722
00:28:26,225 --> 00:28:27,924
The second syllable "baek" refers...

723
00:28:27,925 --> 00:28:30,354
to coniferous trees.

724
00:28:30,355 --> 00:28:31,764
An example is a cypress tree.

725
00:28:31,765 --> 00:28:35,765
Pine nuts are fruits grown on coniferous trees.

726
00:28:36,035 --> 00:28:38,934
As soon as I heard the question, I said pine nuts. I was right.

727
00:28:38,935 --> 00:28:39,965
Right.

728
00:28:40,265 --> 00:28:41,605
Good job, Yi Kyung.

729
00:28:42,005 --> 00:28:44,334
- You're an all-rounder today. - No, I'm not.

730
00:28:44,335 --> 00:28:46,704
- You're an all-rounder today. - He's more than perfect.

731
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:47,804
- You're more than perfect. - No.

732
00:28:47,805 --> 00:28:48,844
You're more than perfect.

733
00:28:48,845 --> 00:28:49,975
What is it?

734
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:51,985
One, two, three.

735
00:28:52,085 --> 00:28:53,085
(Foot volleyball)
Foot volleyball?

736
00:28:54,086 --> 00:28:55,454
- With the staff? - Fifteen points?

737
00:28:55,455 --> 00:28:56,985
That's why they gave them food.

738
00:28:57,215 --> 00:28:58,655
- Please say hello. - Gosh.

739
00:28:58,985 --> 00:29:01,694
(The players appear.)

740
00:29:01,695 --> 00:29:02,794
"Play foot volleyball against the staff members."

741
00:29:02,795 --> 00:29:03,824
"Earn 15 points."

742
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,424
Here's the positive side. Even if the score is 1,000 to 15,

743
00:29:06,425 --> 00:29:07,925
we just need to earn 15 points.

744
00:29:08,025 --> 00:29:09,394
Let's earn them quickly.

745
00:29:09,395 --> 00:29:10,395
- Let's go. - Let's go.

746
00:29:10,396 --> 00:29:12,241
- Get punished fast if necessary. - Let's start right away.

747
00:29:12,265 --> 00:29:13,265
Yes.

748
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:14,365
- Pine nuts. - Pine nuts.

749
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:16,505
Dongchimi makguksu, yes.

750
00:29:17,375 --> 00:29:18,475
Well done.

751
00:29:18,945 --> 00:29:20,574
(Wish card)

752
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:21,575
We're done.

753
00:29:21,815 --> 00:29:22,975
- Are you done? - Yes.

754
00:29:23,075 --> 00:29:24,395
- Shall we start the quiz? - Yes.

755
00:29:24,515 --> 00:29:27,445
As soon as we answer it correctly, we can go home.

756
00:29:27,815 --> 00:29:28,855
Right.

757
00:29:29,355 --> 00:29:30,985
I'll leave without looking back.

758
00:29:31,355 --> 00:29:32,825
Let's say that we got it wrong.

759
00:29:33,225 --> 00:29:34,384
- If we get it wrong... - If we get it wrong...

760
00:29:34,385 --> 00:29:35,924
- We have to make it. - I know.

761
00:29:35,925 --> 00:29:37,795
If we get it wrong, our only hope is Yangyang.

762
00:29:37,925 --> 00:29:38,925
Only Yangyang?

763
00:29:38,926 --> 00:29:40,595
Yangyang isn't far from here.

764
00:29:40,725 --> 00:29:43,395
Here's the quiz.

765
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:48,435
According to anecdotes handed down to jang experts...

766
00:29:49,175 --> 00:29:50,405
Anecdotes?

767
00:29:50,775 --> 00:29:54,175
Under the rule of King Seonjo, the post assigned to the one...

768
00:29:54,445 --> 00:29:57,215
- The question is about jang. - who makes jang called hapjangsa...

769
00:29:57,575 --> 00:29:58,644
"Hapjangsa?"

770
00:29:58,645 --> 00:30:00,284
- He makes jang. - That's correct.

771
00:30:00,285 --> 00:30:01,984
The Royal Court was against it when the post was given...

772
00:30:01,985 --> 00:30:03,685
to someone named Shin.

773
00:30:04,355 --> 00:30:05,855
What was the reason?

774
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,084
(I see.)

775
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:10,495
Wasn't it because he had the same last name as the king?

776
00:30:11,525 --> 00:30:13,425
Because it's the king's last name?

777
00:30:13,925 --> 00:30:15,234
During Joseon dynasty,

778
00:30:15,235 --> 00:30:17,334
- no king was named Shin. - Really?

779
00:30:17,335 --> 00:30:18,605
The king's...

780
00:30:19,605 --> 00:30:22,004
ex-girlfriend's last name was Shin.

781
00:30:22,005 --> 00:30:23,174
(Laughing)

782
00:30:23,175 --> 00:30:24,474
It was okay for the king...

783
00:30:24,475 --> 00:30:25,905
to be in multiple relationships.

784
00:30:26,775 --> 00:30:29,775
When I heard about Shin, I thought of its Chinese character,

785
00:30:30,175 --> 00:30:32,015
which means spicy.

786
00:30:32,215 --> 00:30:33,961
They were afraid that he'd make it too spicy.

787
00:30:33,985 --> 00:30:35,815
What's the Chinese character for Shin?

788
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:37,484
We don't know.

789
00:30:37,485 --> 00:30:38,654
- Can you tell us? - Right.

790
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:39,784
You can tell us that much.

791
00:30:39,785 --> 00:30:41,995
This is how it's written.

792
00:30:42,655 --> 00:30:44,095
Then it doesn't mean spicy.

793
00:30:44,555 --> 00:30:46,624
Sung Hoon, do you know what that character means?

794
00:30:46,625 --> 00:30:47,795
What does it mean?

795
00:30:47,995 --> 00:30:49,564
In Japanese,

796
00:30:49,565 --> 00:30:52,265
we use that character...

797
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:55,305
when we apologize.

798
00:30:55,835 --> 00:30:58,274
"Moshiwake gozaimasen" means I'm very sorry.

799
00:30:58,275 --> 00:30:59,275
"Moshiwake gozaimasen?"

800
00:30:59,276 --> 00:31:01,675
It means that I'm very sorry.

801
00:31:02,515 --> 00:31:06,315
Questions on the show have never been...

802
00:31:06,615 --> 00:31:08,615
as important as we'd imagine.

803
00:31:09,455 --> 00:31:10,455
(That's true.)

804
00:31:10,456 --> 00:31:12,225
- It's not... - The last name is Shin.

805
00:31:12,685 --> 00:31:14,155
Based on our level,

806
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:16,425
maybe they thought that it'd be too sour.

807
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:18,294
Shin.

808
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:20,365
Could this be the answer?

809
00:31:20,495 --> 00:31:21,734
Since his last name was Shin...

810
00:31:21,735 --> 00:31:23,994
- The Chinese character for spicy... - Could it be...

811
00:31:23,995 --> 00:31:25,805
It could be something like that.

812
00:31:26,365 --> 00:31:29,034
- For example, Shin sounds... - That could be it.

813
00:31:29,035 --> 00:31:30,634
Similar to the deity up above.

814
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:31,804
- They're the same word. - It's 1 of the 2.

815
00:31:31,805 --> 00:31:33,144
- I think it's 1 of the 2. - That's why...

816
00:31:33,145 --> 00:31:35,225
- the King didn't like it. - I didn't think of that.

817
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:37,114
The deity is higher than him.

818
00:31:37,115 --> 00:31:38,844
If someone who's higher than him is called Shin...

819
00:31:38,845 --> 00:31:40,165
"Shin" could also mean the deity.

820
00:31:40,345 --> 00:31:41,684
- Right. - So...

821
00:31:41,685 --> 00:31:44,185
Oh, wait a minute.

822
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,854
- That must be it. - Wait.

823
00:31:45,855 --> 00:31:48,354
- Right. I thought of that too. - This is how you write deity.

824
00:31:48,355 --> 00:31:50,194
- The Chinese character... - I thought of this too.

825
00:31:50,195 --> 00:31:51,655
- And so... - This is the deity.

826
00:31:52,095 --> 00:31:53,164
Right.

827
00:31:53,165 --> 00:31:55,271
- The same character is on the side. - We can see it clearly now.

828
00:31:55,295 --> 00:31:56,295
(Getting goosebumps)
- Unbelievable. - It's on the side.

829
00:31:57,295 --> 00:31:58,295
We can see it clearly now.

830
00:31:58,296 --> 00:31:59,364
Sung Hoon.

831
00:31:59,365 --> 00:32:01,304
We must be on the right track.

832
00:32:01,305 --> 00:32:02,374
Hold on.

833
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:03,605
I think it's right.

834
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:04,734
Gosh.

835
00:32:04,735 --> 00:32:06,044
This is much better than Spicy Shin.

836
00:32:06,045 --> 00:32:07,144
This is much better.

837
00:32:07,145 --> 00:32:08,515
This is how you write "king."

838
00:32:08,645 --> 00:32:09,774
- In the character for the deity, - Right.

839
00:32:09,775 --> 00:32:11,474
- the name Shin is in it. - It's in it.

840
00:32:11,475 --> 00:32:12,984
This is unbelievable.

841
00:32:12,985 --> 00:32:14,544
The Chinese characters explain it.

842
00:32:14,545 --> 00:32:15,614
I don't believe this.

843
00:32:15,615 --> 00:32:17,254
If I'm correct,

844
00:32:17,255 --> 00:32:18,685
don't invite me again next time.

845
00:32:18,785 --> 00:32:20,085
(Laughing)

846
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:22,594
(Dong Hyun, I did the best I could.)

847
00:32:22,595 --> 00:32:23,724
I'm so convinced...

848
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:25,464
that even if we have another idea, I'd go with this one.

849
00:32:25,465 --> 00:32:26,524
- Yes. - Right?

850
00:32:26,525 --> 00:32:28,085
- Let's go with it. - You agree, right?

851
00:32:28,395 --> 00:32:29,834
- We have the answer. - Sung Hoon, please say it.

852
00:32:29,835 --> 00:32:30,864
- Tell him the answer. - Okay.

853
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,234
As I said before,

854
00:32:32,235 --> 00:32:36,105
deity is above the King.

855
00:32:36,405 --> 00:32:39,505
In Chinese characters,

856
00:32:39,645 --> 00:32:41,245
the character "Shin" is...

857
00:32:41,445 --> 00:32:43,015
part of the character for the deity.

858
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,085
There can't be anyone above the King.

859
00:32:46,385 --> 00:32:48,915
So he wasn't allowed to make jang like doenjang.

860
00:32:49,485 --> 00:32:50,854
(As the character for Shin is included in the character...)

861
00:32:50,855 --> 00:32:52,124
(for the deity, they were against it.)

862
00:32:52,125 --> 00:32:53,255
- This is... - This is...

863
00:32:53,425 --> 00:32:54,624
If this is the right answer,

864
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:56,755
- everything would be perfect. - Right?

865
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:58,054
It'd be perfect.

866
00:32:58,055 --> 00:33:01,365
It would make us look like intellectuals today.

867
00:33:01,425 --> 00:33:03,464
We'd be so smart.

868
00:33:03,465 --> 00:33:05,665
- We... - It's correct no matter what.

869
00:33:06,135 --> 00:33:07,365
The answer you said.

870
00:33:08,065 --> 00:33:09,175
This is correct,

871
00:33:09,375 --> 00:33:11,205
- in my opinion. - We don't know yet.

872
00:33:11,945 --> 00:33:13,144
(Could it be the answer?)

873
00:33:13,145 --> 00:33:14,175
Is it correct?

874
00:33:15,515 --> 00:33:17,775
(Groaning)

875
00:33:18,215 --> 00:33:19,245
Gosh, this is intense.

876
00:33:19,985 --> 00:33:21,045
It's intense.

877
00:33:21,445 --> 00:33:23,445
It's intense because I haven't felt it in a while.

878
00:33:24,355 --> 00:33:25,685
Here we go.

879
00:33:25,985 --> 00:33:27,425
The answer you just said.

880
00:33:27,885 --> 00:33:31,095
(Sung Hoon's Shin inside the deity)

881
00:33:32,565 --> 00:33:33,565
Incorrect.

882
00:33:35,165 --> 00:33:36,694
- It's incorrect? - It's incorrect?

883
00:33:36,695 --> 00:33:38,635
We'd have gone with this answer anyway.

884
00:33:39,035 --> 00:33:40,334
We shouldn't regret...

885
00:33:40,335 --> 00:33:41,834
(Sighing)

886
00:33:41,835 --> 00:33:44,105
- It's incorrect. - What's the answer?

887
00:33:44,305 --> 00:33:47,174
One of you said the answer very briefly.

888
00:33:47,175 --> 00:33:48,775
- Is that so? - Very briefly.

889
00:33:48,975 --> 00:33:49,975
Very briefly?

890
00:33:49,976 --> 00:33:51,715
Then it can't be about the spiciness.

891
00:33:52,845 --> 00:33:54,014
- Is that so? - The sour taste?

892
00:33:54,015 --> 00:33:56,031
- It can't be about the spiciness. - The sour taste?

893
00:33:56,055 --> 00:33:57,815
- Is it the sour taste? - Yes.

894
00:33:58,355 --> 00:33:59,825
The sour taste?

895
00:34:00,025 --> 00:34:01,185
Did you say that?

896
00:34:01,425 --> 00:34:02,924
- I didn't think... - Sour, not spicy?

897
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:03,925
Yes.

898
00:34:04,095 --> 00:34:05,625
Based on our level,

899
00:34:06,095 --> 00:34:07,735
maybe they thought that it'd be too sour.

900
00:34:08,535 --> 00:34:10,735
(It passed by as everyone was deep in thought.)

901
00:34:10,895 --> 00:34:12,404
If someone named Shin makes jang,

902
00:34:12,405 --> 00:34:13,634
they thought that...

903
00:34:13,635 --> 00:34:14,915
- jang could taste sour. - Shin.

904
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:16,775
- So they were against it. - Really?

905
00:34:16,776 --> 00:34:19,205
Did they care about such wordplay 100 years ago?

906
00:34:19,405 --> 00:34:21,104
- It's wordplay. - Is the level of the show...

907
00:34:21,105 --> 00:34:23,345
much lower than I thought?

908
00:34:23,615 --> 00:34:25,015
- I mean... - The sour taste.

909
00:34:25,685 --> 00:34:27,645
The Chinese characters were so...

910
00:34:27,885 --> 00:34:29,915
- They were amazing. - They were amazing.

911
00:34:30,115 --> 00:34:31,925
- You were truly amazing. - We lost,

912
00:34:31,985 --> 00:34:33,624
but we fought well.

913
00:34:33,625 --> 00:34:34,785
- You failed. - Gosh.

914
00:34:35,355 --> 00:34:37,724
Where will you go next?

915
00:34:37,725 --> 00:34:39,325
- I don't want to go. - We aren't going.

916
00:34:39,695 --> 00:34:41,394
We aren't sure about going to Yangyang.

917
00:34:41,395 --> 00:34:44,134
- We're in an ambiguous spot. - This is the most annoying.

918
00:34:44,135 --> 00:34:45,205
Things aren't clear now.

919
00:34:45,265 --> 00:34:46,564
Shall we go to Yangyang?

920
00:34:46,565 --> 00:34:47,934
- We have no choice. - We have to go to Yangyang.

921
00:34:47,935 --> 00:34:49,634
- Yangyang is the closest. - Okay.

922
00:34:49,635 --> 00:34:51,675
I prefer to find the other team in Yangyang.

923
00:34:52,145 --> 00:34:54,075
- You prefer? - So I can wait and ask them.

924
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:57,415
Ask them what they wished for.

925
00:34:57,815 --> 00:34:59,045
Or they failed the quizzes.

926
00:34:59,785 --> 00:35:02,331
We're playing foot volleyball at the beach in the middle of winter.

927
00:35:02,355 --> 00:35:04,855
(Foot volleyball court next to the sea)

928
00:35:05,155 --> 00:35:07,654
- Shall we go? - Let's go to the location.

929
00:35:07,655 --> 00:35:09,224
(Team Handsome's time to exercise)

930
00:35:09,225 --> 00:35:10,894
It feels like we're entering a match.

931
00:35:10,895 --> 00:35:12,565
Why do 15 points feel so big?

932
00:35:12,895 --> 00:35:15,195
Earning 15 points might take longer than we think.

933
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:18,241
The worst would be hearing the alarm sound while playing foot volleyball.

934
00:35:18,265 --> 00:35:20,504
The sun sets, and it's 8pm.

935
00:35:20,505 --> 00:35:22,035
We play two hours of foot volleyball.

936
00:35:22,775 --> 00:35:24,004
Let's stay positive.

937
00:35:24,005 --> 00:35:25,675
Si Yang, you have a good attitude.

938
00:35:25,805 --> 00:35:27,045
Here are the players.

939
00:35:28,245 --> 00:35:29,515
Let me receive the ball.

940
00:35:30,745 --> 00:35:32,444
(Team Handsome warms up.)

941
00:35:32,445 --> 00:35:33,515
You're good.

942
00:35:34,485 --> 00:35:35,555
That's nice.

943
00:35:36,655 --> 00:35:37,655
(Grunting)

944
00:35:38,955 --> 00:35:40,185
(Home run)

945
00:35:41,655 --> 00:35:43,695
(He doesn't look stable.)

946
00:35:44,455 --> 00:35:46,325
Why don't we focus on kicking the ball up?

947
00:35:47,965 --> 00:35:49,565
(Tap)

948
00:35:50,235 --> 00:35:52,635
(His footwork looks extraordinary.)

949
00:35:52,905 --> 00:35:54,604
(Tap)

950
00:35:54,605 --> 00:35:55,675
Without hitting...

951
00:35:55,805 --> 00:35:56,805
(Exclaiming)

952
00:35:57,635 --> 00:36:00,075
(Something that cool deserves a replay.)

953
00:36:00,305 --> 00:36:02,945
(I am a former athlete.)

954
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:04,874
Those representing the staff will enter the court.

955
00:36:04,875 --> 00:36:05,985
Come on out.

956
00:36:06,785 --> 00:36:08,345
They look like they're masters at this.

957
00:36:09,155 --> 00:36:10,854
The sound engineer has on a sweatshirt again.

958
00:36:10,855 --> 00:36:11,855
(Directing Team, Audio Team, Security Team)

959
00:36:11,856 --> 00:36:13,585
We'll get you a bowl of makguksu each.

960
00:36:13,685 --> 00:36:15,624
- Let's have a good game. - Have it end quickly.

961
00:36:15,625 --> 00:36:16,854
Let this be quick.

962
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:18,425
The inner square is our court.

963
00:36:18,555 --> 00:36:20,294
- It's the inner square. - Got it.

964
00:36:20,295 --> 00:36:22,234
(3-on-3 foot volleyball: They must score 15 points.)

965
00:36:22,235 --> 00:36:24,094
Go, Team Handsome.

966
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:25,335
Go, team.

967
00:36:26,365 --> 00:36:27,565
Okay!

968
00:36:28,635 --> 00:36:29,975
- Go, team. - Go, team.

969
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:31,875
(Wait!)

970
00:36:33,445 --> 00:36:34,544
- Yes! - Okay!

971
00:36:34,545 --> 00:36:35,791
(Team Handsome easily scores a point.)

972
00:36:35,815 --> 00:36:37,775
I loved the timing on that. It's 1 to 0.

973
00:36:38,175 --> 00:36:39,985
That felt like a cheap shot.

974
00:36:40,785 --> 00:36:41,945
(Si Yang serves once again.)

975
00:36:42,615 --> 00:36:44,414
Yes! It would've gone out.

976
00:36:44,415 --> 00:36:46,061
He caught it even though it would've gone out.

977
00:36:46,085 --> 00:36:47,801
(They score 2 points with serve aces alone.)

978
00:36:47,825 --> 00:36:48,825
- Sorry. - Nice!

979
00:36:48,826 --> 00:36:49,931
(Maybe he hasn't warmed up yet.)

980
00:36:49,955 --> 00:36:51,124
Serve.

981
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,525
(Team Handsome continues to serve.)

982
00:36:52,565 --> 00:36:53,625
Okay, it went in.

983
00:36:53,725 --> 00:36:54,924
It went in.

984
00:36:54,925 --> 00:36:55,934
(Pass)

985
00:36:55,935 --> 00:36:57,165
The shape is like a triangle.

986
00:36:57,865 --> 00:36:59,035
Yes!

987
00:36:59,105 --> 00:37:00,804
- Okay. - What's going on?

988
00:37:00,805 --> 00:37:02,045
- Okay! - What's with you guys?

989
00:37:02,435 --> 00:37:03,505
Is this a bonus round?

990
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:04,675
What do I do?

991
00:37:05,105 --> 00:37:06,821
(The foot volleyball mercenaries haven't been able to score.)

992
00:37:06,845 --> 00:37:08,445
This will take us less than ten minutes.

993
00:37:08,715 --> 00:37:10,395
- Here we go. - You scored all our points.

994
00:37:12,645 --> 00:37:13,684
Out.

995
00:37:13,685 --> 00:37:15,415
We need to receive now.

996
00:37:17,455 --> 00:37:18,515
My ball.

997
00:37:19,825 --> 00:37:21,355
Okay. Should I?

998
00:37:22,155 --> 00:37:23,155
Good.

999
00:37:23,725 --> 00:37:24,824
Darn.

1000
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:25,865
(A header out of the blue)

1001
00:37:26,065 --> 00:37:27,925
(The mercenaries are finally warmed up.)

1002
00:37:28,935 --> 00:37:30,695
- Okay. - Slow it down and take your time.

1003
00:37:30,935 --> 00:37:32,235
(Yi Kyung sends the ball over.)

1004
00:37:32,765 --> 00:37:34,265
(Out!)

1005
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,534
It's all right.

1006
00:37:35,535 --> 00:37:36,674
- My ball. - Don't bother attacking.

1007
00:37:36,675 --> 00:37:37,905
(But while they play defense)

1008
00:37:38,175 --> 00:37:39,245
Tap.

1009
00:37:39,545 --> 00:37:42,115
(Team Handsome lost points in a row.)

1010
00:37:42,315 --> 00:37:45,115
Guys, call out. We need to call out more.

1011
00:37:45,385 --> 00:37:46,545
I'll only pass the ball.

1012
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:47,715
I'll make them pay.

1013
00:37:48,145 --> 00:37:49,255
Seung Ho, show them.

1014
00:37:50,085 --> 00:37:52,685
(It's Team Handsome's turn to serve again.)

1015
00:37:53,585 --> 00:37:55,855
(Seung Ho must score in this round.)

1016
00:37:56,495 --> 00:37:58,525
(Starting with Seung Ho's serve)

1017
00:37:58,695 --> 00:38:00,025
Nice. Look how stable that was.

1018
00:38:01,125 --> 00:38:02,135
I'll take it.

1019
00:38:05,165 --> 00:38:06,165
(Tap!)

1020
00:38:06,705 --> 00:38:07,964
(An ironclad defense)

1021
00:38:07,965 --> 00:38:09,004
Go.

1022
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:10,704
(The staff attacks at a fast pace.)

1023
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,404
(Seung Ho receives the ball again.)

1024
00:38:12,405 --> 00:38:13,845
Nice. Good job, guys.

1025
00:38:15,045 --> 00:38:16,375
Nice. Good job, guys.

1026
00:38:17,375 --> 00:38:19,514
- Okay! - Okay!

1027
00:38:19,515 --> 00:38:20,791
We just have to send the ball over.

1028
00:38:20,815 --> 00:38:23,585
(Team Handsome is on a roll thanks to Seung Ho's defense.)

1029
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:24,995
I was intimidated for no reason.

1030
00:38:25,685 --> 00:38:26,725
Nice!

1031
00:38:27,685 --> 00:38:28,685
(Seung Ho isn't messing around.)

1032
00:38:28,686 --> 00:38:30,326
This is how good a former athlete can be.

1033
00:38:30,525 --> 00:38:31,555
My gosh.

1034
00:38:32,265 --> 00:38:33,295
Okay!

1035
00:38:34,265 --> 00:38:35,325
Okay!

1036
00:38:35,435 --> 00:38:36,535
I bet that startled you.

1037
00:38:36,865 --> 00:38:38,264
(Before you know it, they're already halfway.)

1038
00:38:38,265 --> 00:38:39,864
- Okay! - Here.

1039
00:38:39,865 --> 00:38:41,605
- Just keep it up. - Sure.

1040
00:38:43,335 --> 00:38:44,875
- What was that? - Okay!

1041
00:38:45,405 --> 00:38:46,405
Were you hit badly?

1042
00:38:46,406 --> 00:38:48,446
There was no need for us to be intimidated by them.

1043
00:38:48,875 --> 00:38:49,875
Here we go.

1044
00:38:49,876 --> 00:38:51,214
(And even after that...)

1045
00:38:51,215 --> 00:38:52,885
- Goodness. - Okay.

1046
00:38:53,015 --> 00:38:54,344
It's not even close.

1047
00:38:54,345 --> 00:38:55,715
He took off his cap.

1048
00:38:56,615 --> 00:38:57,915
- Nice. - Yes!

1049
00:38:59,025 --> 00:39:00,055
Nice.

1050
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:01,785
- Okay. - Nice.

1051
00:39:03,125 --> 00:39:04,225
Why bother?

1052
00:39:04,295 --> 00:39:05,425
Match point.

1053
00:39:09,195 --> 00:39:10,335
(Darn...)

1054
00:39:11,135 --> 00:39:13,405
- Thank you. - Good job and good game.

1055
00:39:13,665 --> 00:39:15,605
- It was... - Let's hurry along.

1056
00:39:16,035 --> 00:39:17,875
- Shall we head to Yangyang? - Sure.

1057
00:39:19,175 --> 00:39:20,344
Think about it though.

1058
00:39:20,345 --> 00:39:21,744
It's been three hours.

1059
00:39:21,745 --> 00:39:24,344
We had them take a 30-minute nap...

1060
00:39:24,345 --> 00:39:26,514
which means they didn't get the question right.

1061
00:39:26,515 --> 00:39:28,285
They failed to eat the kalguksu.

1062
00:39:28,955 --> 00:39:30,415
If we get it right in Yangyang,

1063
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:31,815
we'll have come back from behind.

1064
00:39:32,085 --> 00:39:33,585
Wait. Tae Hyun's calling.

1065
00:39:34,355 --> 00:39:35,554
- I'll do the talking. - Sure.

1066
00:39:35,555 --> 00:39:37,095
- Don't say too much. - Got it.

1067
00:39:37,755 --> 00:39:38,865
Hey, Tae Hyun.

1068
00:39:39,495 --> 00:39:40,965
Why do I hear an engine running?

1069
00:39:41,325 --> 00:39:42,565
Are you still on the move?

1070
00:39:42,995 --> 00:39:44,664
- Yes. - We're doomed.

1071
00:39:44,665 --> 00:39:46,504
- We're doomed. - I feel like we've already lost.

1072
00:39:46,505 --> 00:39:48,704
Just answer this for me.

1073
00:39:48,705 --> 00:39:51,005
What did you use the wish card on?

1074
00:39:51,335 --> 00:39:52,475
We haven't used it yet.

1075
00:39:53,245 --> 00:39:56,214
- You're being ridiculous. - That's a lie.

1076
00:39:56,215 --> 00:39:57,544
They're lying.

1077
00:39:57,545 --> 00:39:58,674
Let us tell you why.

1078
00:39:58,675 --> 00:40:01,185
We kept getting it wrong and wasn't able to play any games.

1079
00:40:02,585 --> 00:40:05,355
- As if that made sense. - That's ridiculous.

1080
00:40:05,525 --> 00:40:07,984
If that's the case... No, that makes no sense.

1081
00:40:07,985 --> 00:40:09,195
That's impossible.

1082
00:40:09,455 --> 00:40:11,824
Seung Ho kept coming up with outrageous ideas,

1083
00:40:11,825 --> 00:40:13,224
so the staff shut us down.

1084
00:40:13,225 --> 00:40:16,994
There's no way you didn't get any questions right.

1085
00:40:16,995 --> 00:40:19,364
We've been filming since 10am,

1086
00:40:19,365 --> 00:40:21,364
and it's already been over seven hours!

1087
00:40:21,365 --> 00:40:22,704
- Tae Hyun... - Listen.

1088
00:40:22,705 --> 00:40:23,834
- Since 9:30am... - We...

1089
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:25,434
which makes it eight hours.

1090
00:40:25,435 --> 00:40:27,544
- Tae Hyun... - You would've gotten at least one.

1091
00:40:27,545 --> 00:40:31,174
Is Si Yang that stupid or what?

1092
00:40:31,175 --> 00:40:32,884
Yi Kyung and Seung Ho...

1093
00:40:32,885 --> 00:40:35,444
kept saying I should follow their lead,

1094
00:40:35,445 --> 00:40:36,884
so I haven't been doing anything.

1095
00:40:36,885 --> 00:40:38,714
The questions we got today were insane.

1096
00:40:38,715 --> 00:40:40,625
- Really? - They were insane.

1097
00:40:40,685 --> 00:40:43,594
We must've gotten lucky with the questions.

1098
00:40:43,595 --> 00:40:45,094
- We chose the easier ones. - Exactly.

1099
00:40:45,095 --> 00:40:47,765
Haven't you gotten one since Gangneung?

1100
00:40:47,865 --> 00:40:50,065
After getting it right in Gangneung,

1101
00:40:50,735 --> 00:40:54,365
we got the next one wrong since it was that tough.

1102
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,604
- I see. - Right.

1103
00:40:55,605 --> 00:40:58,974
We were wondering if we should go to Yangyang.

1104
00:40:58,975 --> 00:41:01,575
We at least know you were in Sokcho.

1105
00:41:02,145 --> 00:41:03,874
You used the tracking card on us.

1106
00:41:03,875 --> 00:41:06,185
Of course we did. Why keep it unused?

1107
00:41:07,015 --> 00:41:08,284
I get it for now.

1108
00:41:08,285 --> 00:41:10,354
Anyway, we're now on our way to Goseong.

1109
00:41:10,355 --> 00:41:12,014
Sure. Good luck.

1110
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:14,484
- Good luck to you too. - We'll see you soon.

1111
00:41:14,485 --> 00:41:15,525
Sure.

1112
00:41:17,525 --> 00:41:18,654
We fooled them.

1113
00:41:18,655 --> 00:41:20,624
(We fooled them good!)

1114
00:41:20,625 --> 00:41:21,664
My gosh.

1115
00:41:21,665 --> 00:41:23,734
What we used the wish card on never crossed their minds.

1116
00:41:23,735 --> 00:41:25,664
Exactly. They have no idea.

1117
00:41:25,665 --> 00:41:27,204
That being said,

1118
00:41:27,205 --> 00:41:28,704
they took a completely different route than ours.

1119
00:41:28,705 --> 00:41:30,504
- Exactly. - They stayed down south.

1120
00:41:30,505 --> 00:41:31,505
Yes, down south.

1121
00:41:31,506 --> 00:41:34,044
We could visit Yangyang and then head to Gangneung.

1122
00:41:34,045 --> 00:41:35,075
- We can. - Good.

1123
00:41:35,345 --> 00:41:36,775
This is insane.

1124
00:41:36,845 --> 00:41:39,214
- Nice! - No way.

1125
00:41:39,215 --> 00:41:41,385
- Nice. - Stealth mode is insane!

1126
00:41:42,085 --> 00:41:43,715
(Gangneung, Yangyang)

1127
00:41:43,885 --> 00:41:46,685
(Team Guys)

1128
00:41:47,055 --> 00:41:48,284
Are we off to Yangyang?

1129
00:41:48,285 --> 00:41:49,554
- Yes. - Let's go.

1130
00:41:49,555 --> 00:41:50,594
Sure.

1131
00:41:50,595 --> 00:41:53,224
I don't believe everything they said.

1132
00:41:53,225 --> 00:41:56,364
My opinion is that they could be lying.

1133
00:41:56,365 --> 00:41:58,134
If they had used it as a reattempt card,

1134
00:41:58,135 --> 00:41:59,664
they would've gotten two in total.

1135
00:41:59,665 --> 00:42:01,234
Them not getting any answers...

1136
00:42:01,235 --> 00:42:02,775
- is absurd. - It's crazy, right?

1137
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,604
I think that's what they used it on.

1138
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:06,704
You think what I said is right?

1139
00:42:06,705 --> 00:42:08,005
Yes, I think you were right.

1140
00:42:08,305 --> 00:42:09,444
They probably got it right in Jeongseon...

1141
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:10,575
with the reattempt card.

1142
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,445
- I believe so. - Right.

1143
00:42:12,485 --> 00:42:15,414
They traveled up to get all four squares.

1144
00:42:15,415 --> 00:42:17,495
(They traveled up to obtain the 4 squares up north.)

1145
00:42:18,715 --> 00:42:21,625
Casting a wish to mute the cuckoo alarm?

1146
00:42:21,655 --> 00:42:23,195
That's new.

1147
00:42:24,095 --> 00:42:26,524
It's actually a clever wish.

1148
00:42:26,525 --> 00:42:30,494
- We'll be stuck at the last minute. - We won't know where to go.

1149
00:42:30,495 --> 00:42:32,404
We won't know where to go...

1150
00:42:32,405 --> 00:42:34,264
- because their route is hidden. - We wouldn't know.

1151
00:42:34,265 --> 00:42:35,734
There's a reason why I thought that.

1152
00:42:35,735 --> 00:42:37,774
- When we're around 3 to 3, - Exactly.

1153
00:42:37,775 --> 00:42:38,974
- we... - Three to three?

1154
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,405
- We'd know where they are. - Since we know what they got...

1155
00:42:41,545 --> 00:42:44,375
Rather than having it as a reattempt card...

1156
00:42:44,715 --> 00:42:45,944
(Respect for Team Handsome)

1157
00:42:45,945 --> 00:42:47,515
That courage is commendable.

1158
00:42:48,085 --> 00:42:49,554
I'm feeling good though...

1159
00:42:49,555 --> 00:42:50,984
because we guessed it right.

1160
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,331
- Exactly. - We guessed what it was.

1161
00:42:52,355 --> 00:42:54,385
How did you even think of that?

1162
00:42:55,055 --> 00:42:57,694
- Your hunch is on a roll today. - Exactly.

1163
00:42:57,695 --> 00:43:00,765
We would've been doomed if we went to ride the sleighs.

1164
00:43:01,065 --> 00:43:03,665
(Laughing)

1165
00:43:03,995 --> 00:43:05,595
While having fun...

1166
00:43:06,735 --> 00:43:09,035
The game could've ended with them scoring a bingo.

1167
00:43:09,135 --> 00:43:10,275
Absolutely.

1168
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,134
Let's head to Yangyang.

1169
00:43:12,135 --> 00:43:13,844
Yangyang's the only place we can go.

1170
00:43:13,845 --> 00:43:16,045
(Team Guys who are in the dark also head to Yangyang.)

1171
00:43:16,145 --> 00:43:17,514
(Team Handsome arrives in Yangyang.)

1172
00:43:17,515 --> 00:43:19,985
All right. We're now in Yangyang.

1173
00:43:20,815 --> 00:43:22,315
If we get both squares,

1174
00:43:22,615 --> 00:43:24,135
- we'll have scored two bingos. - Two.

1175
00:43:24,255 --> 00:43:25,884
- You're right. We'll get two. - Two bingos.

1176
00:43:25,885 --> 00:43:27,454
(Will they occupy Yangyang and Gangneung A to complete two bingos?)

1177
00:43:27,455 --> 00:43:28,825
That'll be the dream.

1178
00:43:29,095 --> 00:43:30,294
We were smart...

1179
00:43:30,295 --> 00:43:31,855
- to take the cities up north. - Right.

1180
00:43:31,955 --> 00:43:34,225
This place is famous for kalguksu and everything.

1181
00:43:35,095 --> 00:43:37,495
(What they'll meet in Yangyang, the place of delicious food)

1182
00:43:38,065 --> 00:43:39,104
(What will potato dough soup taste like?)

1183
00:43:39,105 --> 00:43:40,265
I've had it before.

1184
00:43:41,335 --> 00:43:42,805
Spring Days Will Leave Us.

1185
00:43:43,305 --> 00:43:44,305
(My gosh)

1186
00:43:44,375 --> 00:43:45,605
Spring Days Will Leave Us.

1187
00:43:46,145 --> 00:43:48,304
What a name for a restaurant.

1188
00:43:48,305 --> 00:43:49,374
(Potato dough soup, here we come.)

1189
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,375
Let's eat.

1190
00:43:51,775 --> 00:43:54,214
(They enter the restaurant that is unlike other places.)

1191
00:43:54,215 --> 00:43:56,084
- Hello. - Hello.

1192
00:43:56,085 --> 00:43:59,254
- Hello. - Gosh, hello.

1193
00:43:59,255 --> 00:44:00,325
Is this our seat?

1194
00:44:03,195 --> 00:44:05,094
I love it. I love this vibe.

1195
00:44:05,095 --> 00:44:10,035
(Yangyang: Potato dough soup)

1196
00:44:10,465 --> 00:44:11,735
Gosh, this place.

1197
00:44:11,835 --> 00:44:14,234
It's perfect to enjoy a bottle of soju.

1198
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:15,334
- Right? - Yes.

1199
00:44:15,335 --> 00:44:16,374
Can it be more romantic?

1200
00:44:16,375 --> 00:44:17,551
(A restaurant overflowing with a romantic vibe)

1201
00:44:17,575 --> 00:44:20,244
- Check out the name. - I love it inside,

1202
00:44:20,245 --> 00:44:21,544
but I like the atmosphere of this seat.

1203
00:44:21,545 --> 00:44:23,544
Is your potato dough soup that good?

1204
00:44:23,545 --> 00:44:24,714
That's right.

1205
00:44:24,715 --> 00:44:27,015
Should we have two bowls of potato dough soup?

1206
00:44:27,085 --> 00:44:29,654
- There's a lot more. - Tell me about it.

1207
00:44:29,655 --> 00:44:30,655
Gosh, it's cold.

1208
00:44:30,855 --> 00:44:33,254
(Take your pick.)

1209
00:44:33,255 --> 00:44:35,495
We need to order at least one bowl of potato dough soup.

1210
00:44:35,895 --> 00:44:37,755
Why don't we get a taste of the sand eel dish?

1211
00:44:38,355 --> 00:44:39,564
- Should we? - It's protein.

1212
00:44:39,565 --> 00:44:40,664
- Should we? - Should we?

1213
00:44:40,665 --> 00:44:41,895
Then, let's...

1214
00:44:45,035 --> 00:44:46,634
No, it's fine. Eat what you want.

1215
00:44:46,635 --> 00:44:47,704
It won't take long.

1216
00:44:47,705 --> 00:44:49,004
Right, it won't take long.

1217
00:44:49,005 --> 00:44:51,704
We'll have a bowl of potato dough soup...

1218
00:44:51,705 --> 00:44:53,344
and a small portion of fried sand eel.

1219
00:44:53,345 --> 00:44:54,375
Sure.

1220
00:44:55,305 --> 00:44:58,545
(The romantic tent bar cooks to order.)

1221
00:44:59,215 --> 00:45:03,385
(Hold on just a second.)

1222
00:45:03,415 --> 00:45:04,814
It'd be funny to have...

1223
00:45:04,815 --> 00:45:06,295
the other team watch us while we eat.

1224
00:45:07,255 --> 00:45:08,524
Let's look glum.

1225
00:45:08,525 --> 00:45:10,795
This is our strategy. I'll get rid of this.

1226
00:45:11,525 --> 00:45:12,665
Look glum...

1227
00:45:13,225 --> 00:45:14,865
and beg them to let us get one right.

1228
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:17,435
- Seems like we don't care anymore. - Exactly.

1229
00:45:17,535 --> 00:45:18,995
We'll then tell them to go there.

1230
00:45:19,565 --> 00:45:21,635
- Sokcho A. - You'll get it right at Sokcho A.

1231
00:45:21,965 --> 00:45:23,835
(Their Hamheung naengmyeon was to die for.)

1232
00:45:24,705 --> 00:45:28,605
(While they were cooking up a way to fool Team Guys)

1233
00:45:28,845 --> 00:45:30,314
- Goodness. - Thank you.

1234
00:45:30,315 --> 00:45:32,115
- That's fried sand eel. Thanks. - Thank you.

1235
00:45:33,115 --> 00:45:34,514
- Goodness. Thank you. - Thank you.

1236
00:45:34,515 --> 00:45:36,455
(Golden-brown)

1237
00:45:37,485 --> 00:45:41,184
(Cutting the fully cooked sand eel in half)

1238
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:43,824
- That looks good. Look at the roe. - It's packed with roe.

1239
00:45:43,825 --> 00:45:44,995
- Is that roe? - Yes.

1240
00:45:45,025 --> 00:45:48,024
This is a moment for the world to be beautiful.

1241
00:45:48,025 --> 00:45:49,335
Let's try it.

1242
00:45:50,165 --> 00:45:51,865
(Dipping in soy sauce)

1243
00:45:51,965 --> 00:45:52,965
- Here. - No, you first.

1244
00:45:52,966 --> 00:45:55,004
- It's all right. - I'll get mine myself.

1245
00:45:55,005 --> 00:45:57,035
- Here. - Don't get any on your clothes.

1246
00:45:57,875 --> 00:45:59,135
(Crunchy)

1247
00:45:59,705 --> 00:46:02,375
(Crunchy outside and hot inside)

1248
00:46:03,745 --> 00:46:05,245
(It's hot.)

1249
00:46:06,215 --> 00:46:07,614
(Summoning the frown of the truth)

1250
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,714
It's hot.

1251
00:46:08,715 --> 00:46:10,075
(Summoning the frown of the truth)

1252
00:46:12,285 --> 00:46:14,655
This one is really good.

1253
00:46:14,955 --> 00:46:16,525
It tastes like a thick filefish jerky.

1254
00:46:16,655 --> 00:46:18,555
- It's so flavorful. - Gosh.

1255
00:46:19,195 --> 00:46:20,294
I've never...

1256
00:46:20,295 --> 00:46:22,265
- had something like this before. - Me neither.

1257
00:46:22,635 --> 00:46:25,694
Inside the crunchy batter,

1258
00:46:25,695 --> 00:46:28,034
it feels more like a custard cream...

1259
00:46:28,035 --> 00:46:29,735
the more I chew it.

1260
00:46:29,775 --> 00:46:31,481
- It's a good side dish. - It's very thick.

1261
00:46:31,505 --> 00:46:34,175
- It calls for beer. - That's right.

1262
00:46:34,545 --> 00:46:36,045
It's a perfect snack for beer.

1263
00:46:36,775 --> 00:46:38,575
- Here you are. - Thank you.

1264
00:46:39,045 --> 00:46:40,845
I want to hide this for some reason.

1265
00:46:41,485 --> 00:46:43,015
Gosh, sir. Thank you.

1266
00:46:43,185 --> 00:46:44,485
I'll hide it behind the camera.

1267
00:46:45,455 --> 00:46:48,955
(He hides the bingo board out of anxiety.)

1268
00:46:49,855 --> 00:46:51,494
- We'll try the potato dough soup. - The potato dough soup.

1269
00:46:51,495 --> 00:46:52,855
(We'll try the potato dough soup.)

1270
00:46:53,525 --> 00:46:56,134
(Finally, they try the potato dough soup.)

1271
00:46:56,135 --> 00:46:57,295
Look how steamy it is.

1272
00:46:59,365 --> 00:47:00,835
(Blowing)

1273
00:47:04,705 --> 00:47:06,405
(Gulping)

1274
00:47:10,575 --> 00:47:13,115
It's potato, but it tastes like tteok inside.

1275
00:47:13,745 --> 00:47:16,315
Right? They probably used starch, didn't they?

1276
00:47:16,855 --> 00:47:18,414
(Curious)

1277
00:47:18,415 --> 00:47:19,585
Sir.

1278
00:47:19,625 --> 00:47:21,625
What's in the potato dough that makes it so chewy?

1279
00:47:21,785 --> 00:47:23,025
Potato starch.

1280
00:47:23,325 --> 00:47:25,094
- Is that all beside potatoes? - I knew it.

1281
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:26,195
Yes.

1282
00:47:26,425 --> 00:47:29,125
It's just potato, but it's so chewy as if there was tteok in it.

1283
00:47:30,235 --> 00:47:31,394
That's the skill.

1284
00:47:31,395 --> 00:47:32,395
(That's the skill.)

1285
00:47:32,435 --> 00:47:34,064
How long have you run this place?

1286
00:47:34,065 --> 00:47:36,235
It's been 12 years.

1287
00:47:36,475 --> 00:47:38,274
Every place is over ten years old.

1288
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:39,444
It has to be this old to be famous.

1289
00:47:39,445 --> 00:47:41,005
(It's good.)

1290
00:47:41,345 --> 00:47:44,144
- How did you start it? - At first,

1291
00:47:44,145 --> 00:47:45,984
I have a team of friends that enjoy makgeolli together.

1292
00:47:45,985 --> 00:47:47,044
- A team? - Yes.

1293
00:47:47,045 --> 00:47:48,585
"Let's make a playground."

1294
00:47:49,145 --> 00:47:51,384
- A playground. A place to hang. - Yes.

1295
00:47:51,385 --> 00:47:54,085
I started this place to make a place for us to hang out.

1296
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:57,225
(And it has become so popular.)

1297
00:47:57,255 --> 00:47:58,954
Various people were gathered.

1298
00:47:58,955 --> 00:48:00,495
Some sang.

1299
00:48:01,125 --> 00:48:03,794
Different people came together to make this place.

1300
00:48:03,795 --> 00:48:07,965
(Before they know it, it has become a viral restaurant.)

1301
00:48:08,035 --> 00:48:09,164
(Team Guys)

1302
00:48:09,165 --> 00:48:10,375
We'll get there.

1303
00:48:10,705 --> 00:48:12,374
We're almost there.

1304
00:48:12,375 --> 00:48:14,745
Gosh. They have nice waves here.

1305
00:48:14,905 --> 00:48:17,515
Do they surf here?

1306
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:19,014
Yes. They do it in Yangyang.

1307
00:48:19,015 --> 00:48:20,444
- Really? - They do surf in this area.

1308
00:48:20,445 --> 00:48:23,485
I've never seen waves that nice.

1309
00:48:23,715 --> 00:48:25,754
It's here. No. It's...

1310
00:48:25,755 --> 00:48:27,154
- There. Yes. - This way.

1311
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:28,625
- What? - They're here.

1312
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:30,155
They've come to Yangyang.

1313
00:48:30,625 --> 00:48:32,554
- Right now? - No?

1314
00:48:32,579 --> 00:48:33,801
- Go to the right. - Isn't that their car?

1315
00:48:34,215 --> 00:48:35,274
- No? - Go to the right.

1316
00:48:35,275 --> 00:48:36,414
Isn't that their car?

1317
00:48:36,415 --> 00:48:37,514
That's right.

1318
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:39,754
That's...

1319
00:48:39,755 --> 00:48:41,384
Gosh. They are here.

1320
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:42,514
(The ones who have been missing all day are here.)

1321
00:48:42,515 --> 00:48:44,284
- Hold on. - I can't see them.

1322
00:48:44,285 --> 00:48:47,155
- Hey, if they're here... - They've come from the north.

1323
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:48,724
Is it possible...

1324
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:50,224
(Is it possible...)

1325
00:48:50,225 --> 00:48:51,464
They must have taken the bingo board, right?

1326
00:48:51,465 --> 00:48:53,565
Can we take a peek at the board?

1327
00:48:54,035 --> 00:48:55,935
- Take a peek? - The bingo board?

1328
00:48:55,995 --> 00:48:57,934
(At the bingo board?)

1329
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,904
- Yes. - If we know their current state,

1330
00:48:59,905 --> 00:49:00,934
we can go to the empty square.

1331
00:49:00,935 --> 00:49:02,334
That's right.

1332
00:49:02,335 --> 00:49:03,574
(They don't have to make a fruitless journey.)

1333
00:49:03,575 --> 00:49:05,205
Okay. Hold on.

1334
00:49:05,605 --> 00:49:09,514
(Then shall we...)

1335
00:49:09,515 --> 00:49:11,645
We know what's up now.

1336
00:49:12,145 --> 00:49:14,655
- Exactly. - We just need to check the board.

1337
00:49:15,415 --> 00:49:18,524
(Team Guys search through the car first.)

1338
00:49:18,525 --> 00:49:19,554
(Opening)

1339
00:49:19,555 --> 00:49:20,625
Open it.

1340
00:49:21,155 --> 00:49:23,125
(It worked?)

1341
00:49:23,195 --> 00:49:25,464
(Find the bingo board quickly.)

1342
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:26,595
(This isn't it.)

1343
00:49:27,395 --> 00:49:28,594
- Is it in there? - They...

1344
00:49:28,595 --> 00:49:29,904
They must have taken it with them.

1345
00:49:29,905 --> 00:49:32,165
(Where is it?)

1346
00:49:32,635 --> 00:49:34,005
They took it with them, of course.

1347
00:49:34,035 --> 00:49:36,075
- Do you see anything? - No.

1348
00:49:36,245 --> 00:49:37,645
- Let's go in there. - Yes.

1349
00:49:37,805 --> 00:49:40,474
Go and just...

1350
00:49:40,475 --> 00:49:41,875
distract them.

1351
00:49:44,145 --> 00:49:47,115
If we check the board and leave, we'll have enough time.

1352
00:49:47,285 --> 00:49:49,785
I think they're in the food tent over there.

1353
00:49:50,455 --> 00:49:53,325
I'm having the potato dough soup with an interesting texture...

1354
00:49:55,355 --> 00:49:59,065
(Like predators on a hunt)

1355
00:49:59,595 --> 00:50:01,035
They saw us.

1356
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:03,635
Cover the board.

1357
00:50:03,965 --> 00:50:05,105
Give it to me, Yi Kyung.

1358
00:50:05,935 --> 00:50:07,205
You're here.

1359
00:50:08,435 --> 00:50:09,775
You're here.

1360
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:12,744
- What? - You're here.

1361
00:50:12,745 --> 00:50:14,544
- Come in. - You're smart.

1362
00:50:14,545 --> 00:50:15,574
- What? - Hello.

1363
00:50:15,575 --> 00:50:18,644
- There may be blue and better blue. - Why do you say that?

1364
00:50:18,645 --> 00:50:20,284
- What? Hello. - Why?

1365
00:50:20,285 --> 00:50:22,154
Gosh. How did you come up with it?

1366
00:50:22,155 --> 00:50:23,324
- What are you talking about? - Gosh.

1367
00:50:23,325 --> 00:50:25,355
- You're so smart. I mean... - Yes.

1368
00:50:25,585 --> 00:50:28,155
How did you come up with the idea to mute the cuckoo alarm?

1369
00:50:29,425 --> 00:50:30,595
We thought...

1370
00:50:30,965 --> 00:50:32,995
Gosh. But he guessed it right...

1371
00:50:33,635 --> 00:50:35,294
- quickly, so... - Just now?

1372
00:50:35,295 --> 00:50:37,495
That's why I said, "There may be blue and better blue."

1373
00:50:37,565 --> 00:50:40,174
Gosh. Hey.

1374
00:50:40,175 --> 00:50:41,404
You knew about it?

1375
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:43,044
- Are you going to keep... - Come on.

1376
00:50:43,045 --> 00:50:45,205
- I know why you're coming this way. - Right.

1377
00:50:45,305 --> 00:50:46,444
(We have to look at that.)

1378
00:50:46,445 --> 00:50:47,844
First of all...

1379
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:49,644
- Only Goseong is left. - Exactly.

1380
00:50:49,645 --> 00:50:50,784
Gosh.

1381
00:50:50,785 --> 00:50:52,145
We couldn't dare to go to Goseong.

1382
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:54,531
They might have occupied Goseong as they told us to go there.

1383
00:50:54,555 --> 00:50:57,224
- No. I'm telling the truth. - You can visit other places, then.

1384
00:50:57,225 --> 00:50:58,354
It's close from here.

1385
00:50:58,355 --> 00:50:59,624
- Now that you know it, - Go to Jeongseon.

1386
00:50:59,625 --> 00:51:00,894
- we don't have to lie anymore. - Jeongseon it is.

1387
00:51:00,895 --> 00:51:01,955
Gosh. Where is it again?

1388
00:51:02,795 --> 00:51:04,894
I took it because I knew you'd look for it.

1389
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:06,535
(There may be blue and better blue.)

1390
00:51:06,735 --> 00:51:08,664
Gosh. Where should we go?

1391
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:10,534
(Team Guys go back without an exciting move.)

1392
00:51:10,535 --> 00:51:11,765
I'm sorry,

1393
00:51:12,365 --> 00:51:13,635
but you have nowhere to go.

1394
00:51:14,535 --> 00:51:15,734
You have no place to go.

1395
00:51:15,735 --> 00:51:17,675
(There's no more place to visit, so good luck.)

1396
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:21,915
(But in the meantime, )

1397
00:51:22,775 --> 00:51:25,484
We can go to Gangneung after this. But you have nowhere to go.

1398
00:51:25,485 --> 00:51:27,261
(Sung Hoon locates the bingo board and learns the interior.)

1399
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:30,184
(Are they leaving?)

1400
00:51:30,185 --> 00:51:31,954
Good luck. Try Jeongseon.

1401
00:51:31,955 --> 00:51:32,994
Tae Hyun.

1402
00:51:32,995 --> 00:51:34,595
(We've protected the information.)

1403
00:51:37,365 --> 00:51:42,064
- He's trying to steal it. - Run.

1404
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,634
(Is he running toward the inside with the bingo board?)

1405
00:51:43,635 --> 00:51:45,905
Wait. What should I do with it?

1406
00:51:46,305 --> 00:51:48,374
Sung Hoon, we can take it from them.

1407
00:51:48,375 --> 00:51:50,204
- Sung Hoon. - Why?

1408
00:51:50,205 --> 00:51:51,845
- We can take it from them. - Sung Hoon.

1409
00:51:52,205 --> 00:51:53,775
- Why? - Gosh.

1410
00:51:54,215 --> 00:51:55,945
- Why? - No, Sung Hoon.

1411
00:51:56,245 --> 00:51:57,544
(Tae Hyun goes inside.)

1412
00:51:57,545 --> 00:51:58,891
- You can't use force against us. - No.

1413
00:51:58,915 --> 00:52:00,084
Hold on.

1414
00:52:00,085 --> 00:52:02,455
- Gosh. Come on. - Where did you hide it? You had it.

1415
00:52:02,915 --> 00:52:04,824
(At that moment, )

1416
00:52:04,825 --> 00:52:10,064
(has Seung Ho received the board and taken it to a safe place?)

1417
00:52:10,065 --> 00:52:11,865
Gosh. He has it.

1418
00:52:11,925 --> 00:52:13,434
Seung Ho has it.

1419
00:52:13,435 --> 00:52:16,864
- No, you have it. - No. I don't have it.

1420
00:52:16,865 --> 00:52:17,934
Come on.

1421
00:52:17,935 --> 00:52:19,634
- Hey, Yi Kyung! - It's here.

1422
00:52:19,635 --> 00:52:21,534
- Wait, Sung Hoon! - Let's take a look.

1423
00:52:21,535 --> 00:52:23,445
Don't do this. Yi Kyung!

1424
00:52:23,905 --> 00:52:25,704
- It's here. - Yi Kyung!

1425
00:52:25,705 --> 00:52:27,145
Please don't move.

1426
00:52:27,415 --> 00:52:28,674
- Where is Seung Ho? - What's wrong with them?

1427
00:52:28,675 --> 00:52:30,414
Seung Ho. Si Yang, you can't let them take it.

1428
00:52:30,415 --> 00:52:31,544
Don't let them take it.

1429
00:52:31,545 --> 00:52:33,185
- Show it to us. - Where is Seung Ho?

1430
00:52:33,415 --> 00:52:35,414
Don't let them take it.

1431
00:52:35,415 --> 00:52:36,455
Here.

1432
00:52:36,685 --> 00:52:37,854
(He has to grab the bingo board.)

1433
00:52:37,855 --> 00:52:39,425
Yi Kyung, toss it backward to me.

1434
00:52:39,725 --> 00:52:40,854
(A mess)

1435
00:52:40,855 --> 00:52:42,095
No.

1436
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:43,925
Don't open it.

1437
00:52:44,025 --> 00:52:46,434
(Did he grab it?)

1438
00:52:46,435 --> 00:52:48,434
Don't open it.

1439
00:52:48,435 --> 00:52:49,834
(Wailing)

1440
00:52:49,835 --> 00:52:51,935
(It has opened.)

1441
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:53,704
- What? - Hold on.

1442
00:52:53,705 --> 00:52:54,905
Did Seung Ho take it?

1443
00:52:55,435 --> 00:52:57,575
- They opened it. - Where did it go?

1444
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:00,175
- Did Seung Ho take it? - Yes.

1445
00:53:01,675 --> 00:53:04,745
Did Seung Ho take it?

1446
00:53:05,485 --> 00:53:06,754
- Okay. - They opened it.

1447
00:53:06,755 --> 00:53:07,814
- They opened it. - Okay.

1448
00:53:07,815 --> 00:53:08,955
Did you see it?

1449
00:53:09,055 --> 00:53:10,655
- I saw it. - They opened it.

1450
00:53:10,755 --> 00:53:13,025
Seung Ho took it. Gosh. He is fast.

1451
00:53:13,695 --> 00:53:14,995
Do you have an idea?

1452
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,994
- Yes. I saw the inside. - Okay. He saw it.

1453
00:53:16,995 --> 00:53:18,525
- Let's go. - Bye.

1454
00:53:18,995 --> 00:53:19,995
Let's go.

1455
00:53:19,996 --> 00:53:21,135
They took it by force.

1456
00:53:21,495 --> 00:53:23,805
- It's a foul play. - Seung Ho, they saw it.

1457
00:53:24,005 --> 00:53:27,175
- Gosh. Sung Hoon rushed in and... - Come on.

1458
00:53:27,575 --> 00:53:29,474
- Gosh. - They know we have three squares.

1459
00:53:29,475 --> 00:53:31,404
It feels like we were in a car accident.

1460
00:53:31,405 --> 00:53:32,544
(Team Handsome was robbed.)

1461
00:53:32,545 --> 00:53:34,314
(Team Guys)

1462
00:53:34,315 --> 00:53:36,584
- Sung Hoon, Sang Uk was... - Hey. I roughly scanned it.

1463
00:53:36,585 --> 00:53:37,784
- Did you? - Yes.

1464
00:53:37,785 --> 00:53:39,314
I'll know it when I look at the board.

1465
00:53:39,315 --> 00:53:40,984
- Okay. Nice. - Me too.

1466
00:53:40,985 --> 00:53:42,984
I knew it.

1467
00:53:42,985 --> 00:53:45,455
- We're athletes. - Good.

1468
00:53:46,595 --> 00:53:49,195
We just need to decide where to go now.

1469
00:53:49,725 --> 00:53:51,525
They've occupied three squares.

1470
00:53:51,565 --> 00:53:53,024
- Three squares. - Gosh.

1471
00:53:53,025 --> 00:53:54,134
Let's see our board.

1472
00:53:54,135 --> 00:53:55,771
- They've got three spots already? - Yes.

1473
00:53:55,795 --> 00:53:57,205
They've occupied three squares.

1474
00:53:57,235 --> 00:53:59,235
- What I saw were these three. - What?

1475
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,104
Where?

1476
00:54:01,105 --> 00:54:02,504
(Sung Hoon remembers Team Handsome's squares exactly.)

1477
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:04,344
- I saw these three. - Sokcho B...

1478
00:54:04,345 --> 00:54:05,805
These two were empty.

1479
00:54:06,105 --> 00:54:07,415
We can go to Sokcho B.

1480
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:09,245
- Sokcho B? - It's unoccupied.

1481
00:54:09,345 --> 00:54:11,514
- I saw these. Right? - These. You're right.

1482
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:13,484
- It's like this. - We were going to Sokcho anyway.

1483
00:54:13,485 --> 00:54:15,014
Basically, we've nullified...

1484
00:54:15,015 --> 00:54:16,455
their wish card.

1485
00:54:16,985 --> 00:54:18,224
(They seized the information...)

1486
00:54:18,225 --> 00:54:19,794
We nullified it by force.

1487
00:54:19,795 --> 00:54:21,154
(by force and good eyesight.)

1488
00:54:21,155 --> 00:54:22,994
Gosh. They got three questions right?

1489
00:54:22,995 --> 00:54:25,195
- Exactly. - It's crazy.

1490
00:54:25,265 --> 00:54:26,265
They got the question...

1491
00:54:26,266 --> 00:54:27,664
- in Jeongseon, right? - They got that one.

1492
00:54:27,665 --> 00:54:29,785
They got Sokcho B wrong at the raw fish noodle place.

1493
00:54:30,335 --> 00:54:31,504
The raw fish noodles?

1494
00:54:31,505 --> 00:54:33,004
We can go there.

1495
00:54:33,005 --> 00:54:35,311
- After going there... - When we get that right, it's over.

1496
00:54:35,335 --> 00:54:38,075
- Hold on. - When they occupy Yangyang...

1497
00:54:38,105 --> 00:54:40,614
We have to hurry and use the exercise transfer card.

1498
00:54:40,615 --> 00:54:41,935
- That's right. - It's because...

1499
00:54:42,115 --> 00:54:44,914
they can go to Gangneung A, which we failed to occupy.

1500
00:54:44,915 --> 00:54:46,044
That's possible.

1501
00:54:46,045 --> 00:54:48,384
Then they can make a bingo.

1502
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,525
I see. If they get the quiz in Gangneung A right.

1503
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:53,225
Even if they get it wrong,

1504
00:54:53,925 --> 00:54:56,424
they'll win with more squares if they have four.

1505
00:54:56,425 --> 00:54:57,465
We...

1506
00:54:58,865 --> 00:55:00,494
It's either a loss or a tie for us.

1507
00:55:00,495 --> 00:55:02,595
(If the other teams gets the quiz in Yangyang)

1508
00:55:03,235 --> 00:55:04,504
They are strong.

1509
00:55:04,505 --> 00:55:06,904
(The vibe descends as they realize they're unfavorable.)

1510
00:55:06,905 --> 00:55:08,275
- Gosh. - It's really...

1511
00:55:09,575 --> 00:55:11,174
- Right? - We have to get there...

1512
00:55:11,175 --> 00:55:13,004
- get the quiz right quickly. - We...

1513
00:55:13,005 --> 00:55:14,774
And use the exercise transfer card.

1514
00:55:14,775 --> 00:55:15,775
We should do that.

1515
00:55:15,776 --> 00:55:18,484
Or they'll have enough time to beat us.

1516
00:55:18,485 --> 00:55:21,184
Let's order one bowl of raw fish noodles.

1517
00:55:21,185 --> 00:55:22,984
We'll take the quiz and use the exercise transfer card.

1518
00:55:22,985 --> 00:55:23,985
Okay.

1519
00:55:23,986 --> 00:55:25,124
(Team Guys' strategy: 1. Clear 1 raw fish noodles quickly.)

1520
00:55:25,125 --> 00:55:26,184
(2. Get the quiz and use the card. 3. Drag time to prevent a bingo.)

1521
00:55:26,185 --> 00:55:27,745
If they get the quiz wrong in Yangyang,

1522
00:55:28,355 --> 00:55:29,864
do we have time to stop by there?

1523
00:55:29,865 --> 00:55:30,865
- We? - Yes.

1524
00:55:30,866 --> 00:55:31,894
It's possible.

1525
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:33,234
- We should go for it. - Yes.

1526
00:55:33,235 --> 00:55:35,064
- We should end it in Yangyang. - Right.

1527
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:37,404
Exactly. It takes about 30 minutes.

1528
00:55:37,405 --> 00:55:40,335
We need to leave at 7:20pm.

1529
00:55:40,635 --> 00:55:42,474
- At 7:20pm? - At 7:20pm.

1530
00:55:42,475 --> 00:55:44,304
Even if we miss the quiz, we leave at 7:20pm.

1531
00:55:44,305 --> 00:55:46,875
(Will Team Guys' plan be successful?)

1532
00:55:47,175 --> 00:55:50,045
I didn't expect Sung Hoon to come.

1533
00:55:50,585 --> 00:55:52,585
Seung Ho, you should have come and helped Si Yang.

1534
00:55:53,455 --> 00:55:54,684
Look at this.

1535
00:55:54,685 --> 00:55:56,725
(The one with good stamina is sad.)

1536
00:55:57,255 --> 00:55:58,815
Do you see how the board is torn apart?

1537
00:56:00,195 --> 00:56:01,854
I thought I was watching the NFL.

1538
00:56:01,855 --> 00:56:03,054
(We've given all.)

1539
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:05,664
I'm sorry, but I think Sung Hoon stepped on my hand.

1540
00:56:05,665 --> 00:56:06,894
Is it covered by work insurance?

1541
00:56:06,895 --> 00:56:08,634
(A wreck)

1542
00:56:08,635 --> 00:56:11,005
I said, "No," and I got stepped on.

1543
00:56:12,665 --> 00:56:17,345
(The hands and feet were all over the fuss with the bingo board.)

1544
00:56:17,545 --> 00:56:18,605
Don't open it.

1545
00:56:19,975 --> 00:56:21,145
Here's the quiz.

1546
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:22,845
At this state?

1547
00:56:23,175 --> 00:56:24,885
Do you need time to prepare for it?

1548
00:56:25,445 --> 00:56:26,555
No, it's all right.

1549
00:56:27,615 --> 00:56:29,484
- Okay. Let's do it calmly. - We can do it calmly.

1550
00:56:29,485 --> 00:56:30,485
(Time for Quiz)

1551
00:56:30,486 --> 00:56:32,084
- Once we get this right? - Yes.

1552
00:56:32,085 --> 00:56:33,954
The thought of double bingo drives me crazy.

1553
00:56:33,955 --> 00:56:35,494
(They still have a chance for a double bingo.)

1554
00:56:35,495 --> 00:56:37,964
This is a picture of Gamjadori,

1555
00:56:37,965 --> 00:56:40,165
a cartoon character that was really popular in 2002.

1556
00:56:40,265 --> 00:56:41,864
Gamjadori wore a red cloak...

1557
00:56:41,865 --> 00:56:44,265
for a certain reason.

1558
00:56:44,535 --> 00:56:46,005
What was this reason?

1559
00:56:46,705 --> 00:56:48,475
The reason he wore a red cloak?

1560
00:56:49,235 --> 00:56:51,004
Hold on. I know the song.

1561
00:56:51,005 --> 00:56:52,375
Hold on. Give me a second.

1562
00:56:52,705 --> 00:56:55,844
(Seung Ho has a hunch as soon as he heard the quiz.)

1563
00:56:55,845 --> 00:56:58,285
I think I know what it is. You can go first.

1564
00:57:01,285 --> 00:57:03,885
A potato sprouts, then it grows leaves

1565
00:57:04,325 --> 00:57:06,725
- Isn't it the song? - I don't think so.

1566
00:57:06,825 --> 00:57:08,455
- I see. - I think I know the answer.

1567
00:57:09,625 --> 00:57:11,394
I'll say it last after hearing what you say.

1568
00:57:11,395 --> 00:57:12,825
Let's see which one feels right.

1569
00:57:13,095 --> 00:57:14,564
I think it's a sweet potato.

1570
00:57:14,565 --> 00:57:16,071
It was because he wanted to be a sweet potato.

1571
00:57:16,095 --> 00:57:18,405
(A sweet potato?)

1572
00:57:18,565 --> 00:57:20,705
This song... Si Yang, do you know this song?

1573
00:57:21,135 --> 00:57:24,074
(Dori, dori, Gamjadori)

1574
00:57:24,075 --> 00:57:25,635
- Do you know this song? - No, I don't.

1575
00:57:26,715 --> 00:57:28,575
(Yi Kyung also has no idea.)

1576
00:57:29,015 --> 00:57:30,684
(Is Seung Ho the only one who knows the song?)

1577
00:57:30,685 --> 00:57:32,014
There's a song that goes like that.

1578
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:33,084
I don't know if it was for "Gamjadori."

1579
00:57:33,085 --> 00:57:34,354
There were many songs for animations back then.

1580
00:57:34,355 --> 00:57:35,815
- You're not sure, then. - No.

1581
00:57:36,155 --> 00:57:38,875
Does it make sense to talk about a sweet potato in Gangwon Province?

1582
00:57:39,025 --> 00:57:41,465
The character has nothing to do with Gangwon Province, right?

1583
00:57:41,655 --> 00:57:45,164
It's a character called Gamjadori that was popular in 2002.

1584
00:57:45,165 --> 00:57:47,065
The year 2002? During the World Cup?

1585
00:57:47,765 --> 00:57:48,795
Yes.

1586
00:57:50,035 --> 00:57:52,205
"Go Korea!" Isn't this it?

1587
00:57:53,105 --> 00:57:54,175
Red Devils?

1588
00:57:54,705 --> 00:57:56,705
As soon as I heard 2002, I thought of it.

1589
00:57:57,645 --> 00:57:58,645
It's the year 2002.

1590
00:57:58,646 --> 00:58:00,445
Of all colors, he wore red.

1591
00:58:01,245 --> 00:58:02,674
- That's the only answer. - It's Red Devils.

1592
00:58:02,675 --> 00:58:04,621
- The Red Devils is the only answer. - That's right.

1593
00:58:04,645 --> 00:58:05,844
- Let's get this over with, - We're losing time.

1594
00:58:05,845 --> 00:58:07,114
And go to Gangneung quickly.

1595
00:58:07,115 --> 00:58:08,235
- Here's the answer. - Okay.

1596
00:58:08,715 --> 00:58:10,684
Because of the 2002 World Cup.

1597
00:58:10,685 --> 00:58:12,285
Because of the 2002 World Cup,

1598
00:58:12,625 --> 00:58:15,094
Gamjadori wore a red cloak.

1599
00:58:15,095 --> 00:58:16,964
(Did Gamjadori wore the red cloak because it was the year 2002?)

1600
00:58:16,965 --> 00:58:17,965
(Because of the 2002 World Cup)

1601
00:58:17,966 --> 00:58:19,225
- It's not correct. - Gosh.

1602
00:58:20,995 --> 00:58:22,064
(Sighing)

1603
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:23,065
No?

1604
00:58:23,905 --> 00:58:25,634
(It wasn't because of the World Cup?)

1605
00:58:25,635 --> 00:58:27,195
- What's the answer? - What's going on?

1606
00:58:27,835 --> 00:58:29,634
The answer is because he wanted...

1607
00:58:29,635 --> 00:58:31,174
to become a sweet potato like his parents.

1608
00:58:31,175 --> 00:58:32,705
- Seung Ho. - You were right.

1609
00:58:35,915 --> 00:58:37,215
Was the sweet potato the answer?

1610
00:58:37,685 --> 00:58:39,045
Gosh. We almost had it.

1611
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:40,814
How can he be a potato...

1612
00:58:40,815 --> 00:58:43,015
when his parents are sweet potatoes?

1613
00:58:43,425 --> 00:58:44,755
I'll tell you about his story.

1614
00:58:44,985 --> 00:58:47,024
His father was a dry sweet potato.

1615
00:58:47,025 --> 00:58:48,454
And his mother was a watery sweet potato.

1616
00:58:48,455 --> 00:58:50,064
They adopted Gamjadori.

1617
00:58:50,065 --> 00:58:51,324
(Gamjadori siblings were adopted by sweet potato parents.)

1618
00:58:51,325 --> 00:58:52,595
He was adopted.

1619
00:58:54,295 --> 00:59:00,205
(Mom, why do we look so yellow?)

1620
00:59:00,675 --> 00:59:02,104
He wanted to become a sweet potato,

1621
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:04,674
so his mother made him a red cloak.

1622
00:59:04,675 --> 00:59:06,074
(Mom made red cloaks for them who wanted to be sweet potatoes.)

1623
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:08,195
(That's how Gamjadori in a red cloak has come to us.)

1624
00:59:10,245 --> 00:59:11,445
Did you find the song?

1625
00:59:12,245 --> 00:59:13,965
- Does the song really exist? - I told you.

1626
00:59:16,455 --> 00:59:17,954
You remembered it correctly.

1627
00:59:17,955 --> 00:59:19,225
(It was right.)

1628
00:59:22,395 --> 00:59:23,424
I told you.

1629
00:59:23,425 --> 00:59:24,664
(Dori, dori, Gamjadori)

1630
00:59:24,665 --> 00:59:25,864
I've never heard it before.

1631
00:59:25,865 --> 00:59:28,334
(Gamjadori with small eyes in a red cloak)

1632
00:59:28,335 --> 00:59:29,535
You watched the animation...

1633
00:59:30,305 --> 00:59:31,804
that you remembered the words?

1634
00:59:31,805 --> 00:59:33,134
(He dreams because he wants to become a sweet potato)

1635
00:59:33,135 --> 00:59:34,404
What grade were you in back then?

1636
00:59:34,405 --> 00:59:35,434
Hold on.

1637
00:59:35,435 --> 00:59:37,104
(I've sung this song before!)

1638
00:59:37,105 --> 00:59:39,145
Why was it aired in 2002?

1639
00:59:39,745 --> 00:59:41,314
(He'll become a sweet potato, then)

1640
00:59:41,315 --> 00:59:42,514
That's how the song ends.

1641
00:59:42,515 --> 00:59:44,014
(He even remembers how it ends.)

1642
00:59:44,015 --> 00:59:46,345
They must be so dumbfounded to hear the song.

1643
00:59:46,615 --> 00:59:48,155
You must have thought,

1644
00:59:48,415 --> 00:59:49,885
"What is he talking about?"

1645
00:59:49,955 --> 00:59:51,384
- It did make no sense. - Right.

1646
00:59:51,385 --> 00:59:53,025
- Of course. - It was out of the blue.

1647
00:59:53,255 --> 00:59:55,355
How can a baby potato become a baby sweet potato?

1648
00:59:56,055 --> 00:59:57,125
Suddenly...

1649
00:59:57,765 --> 00:59:59,595
Do you know what's funny?

1650
00:59:59,895 --> 01:00:01,371
If we get this one, we'll get a bingo.

1651
01:00:01,395 --> 01:00:03,676
If the other team gets this one, they'll get a bingo too.

1652
01:00:03,735 --> 01:00:05,365
We're fighting for the same one.

1653
01:00:06,065 --> 01:00:07,805
Let's hurry to the jang kalguksu place.

1654
01:00:08,135 --> 01:00:09,234
We'll go to Gangneung...

1655
01:00:09,235 --> 01:00:10,874
- and get the last quiz... - We have to get it.

1656
01:00:10,875 --> 01:00:12,044
- to finish this. - Let's finish it.

1657
01:00:12,045 --> 01:00:13,574
- I wish you good health. - Thank you.

1658
01:00:13,575 --> 01:00:14,914
Be happy.

1659
01:00:14,915 --> 01:00:17,015
- Yes. - Yes. Good luck.

1660
01:00:17,345 --> 01:00:20,515
Si Yang, I was even sure for the first time.

1661
01:00:21,285 --> 01:00:23,785
A red cloak in 2002? It's a 100 percent.

1662
01:00:24,025 --> 01:00:25,324
I understand why you thought so.

1663
01:00:25,325 --> 01:00:26,755
I was 100 percent sure.

1664
01:00:27,555 --> 01:00:28,955
We go to Gangneung in the end.

1665
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:31,165
Hey, let's finish it with a bingo. We can do it.

1666
01:00:32,095 --> 01:00:33,165
I'm confused.

1667
01:00:33,895 --> 01:00:35,095
Seung Ho, I love you.

1668
01:00:35,835 --> 01:00:37,435
Hey, I do feel sorry.

1669
01:00:38,535 --> 01:00:39,704
(Sighing deeply)

1670
01:00:39,705 --> 01:00:41,904
No. Don't sigh like that.

1671
01:00:41,905 --> 01:00:43,234
- We feel worse. - We are...

1672
01:00:43,235 --> 01:00:46,345
- so sorry. - No. It's just this situation is...

1673
01:00:46,605 --> 01:00:48,315
Think about it.

1674
01:00:48,375 --> 01:00:50,515
Think how dumbfounded I must feel.

1675
01:00:51,785 --> 01:00:54,025
Gosh. It'll be really fun if we get the last quiz right.

1676
01:00:54,485 --> 01:00:55,914
- Yes. Then... - Right.

1677
01:00:55,915 --> 01:00:57,185
It's a twist after a twist.

1678
01:00:57,585 --> 01:00:58,684
(For Seung Ho, who is feeling down...)

1679
01:00:58,685 --> 01:01:00,154
- Si Yang, can you... - What?

1680
01:01:00,155 --> 01:01:01,954
- Is there a volume button up there? - Yes.

1681
01:01:01,955 --> 01:01:03,254
Can you turn it up?

1682
01:01:03,255 --> 01:01:05,624
(He tries to appease Seung Ho with a song.)

1683
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:09,664
(That's what they thought, but...)

1684
01:01:09,665 --> 01:01:13,505
(They are like Tom and Jerry.)

1685
01:01:14,575 --> 01:01:17,545
(Shaking his head)

1686
01:01:17,875 --> 01:01:19,875
Gamjadori will be in my dream for sure.

1687
01:01:22,745 --> 01:01:24,214
This is it. The raw fish noodles.

1688
01:01:24,215 --> 01:01:25,685
- Is this it? - Good.

1689
01:01:26,115 --> 01:01:28,184
It says "Raw fish noodles" on it.

1690
01:01:28,185 --> 01:01:29,654
We'll finish the noodles in one minute.

1691
01:01:29,655 --> 01:01:30,725
Gosh. Good.

1692
01:01:30,885 --> 01:01:32,125
(Peeking)

1693
01:01:32,585 --> 01:01:33,724
- Welcome. - Yes.

1694
01:01:33,725 --> 01:01:34,894
- Sir. - Hello.

1695
01:01:34,895 --> 01:01:37,724
Rumor has it this place is so famous.

1696
01:01:37,725 --> 01:01:38,964
- So we're here again. - Yes, thank you.

1697
01:01:38,965 --> 01:01:40,064
- Seriously. - Yes.

1698
01:01:40,065 --> 01:01:41,694
Please give up a bowl quickly.

1699
01:01:41,695 --> 01:01:42,695
- Yes. - Yes.

1700
01:01:42,965 --> 01:01:44,004
We...

1701
01:01:44,005 --> 01:01:45,405
(Glancing)

1702
01:01:45,835 --> 01:01:48,235
Give us the quiz at 7:02pm.

1703
01:01:48,935 --> 01:01:50,304
It's 6:59pm right now.

1704
01:01:50,305 --> 01:01:52,104
Give us the quiz at 7:02pm.

1705
01:01:52,105 --> 01:01:54,175
If it sounds difficult, we'll go straight back...

1706
01:01:54,975 --> 01:01:55,975
to Yangyang.

1707
01:01:55,976 --> 01:01:57,714
It's important to quickly make them exercise.

1708
01:01:57,715 --> 01:01:58,715
That's right.

1709
01:01:58,716 --> 01:02:01,054
- Gosh, sir. - It's here.

1710
01:02:01,055 --> 01:02:02,295
- It's for here, right? - Gosh.

1711
01:02:02,785 --> 01:02:04,985
(Amazed)

1712
01:02:05,425 --> 01:02:07,654
(A sweet and sour flavor that hits the tip of the tongue...)

1713
01:02:07,655 --> 01:02:09,554
(and the chewy noodles...)

1714
01:02:09,555 --> 01:02:11,495
(of the raw fish noodles are the best.)

1715
01:02:11,995 --> 01:02:13,965
- Thank you. - Thank you, sir.

1716
01:02:14,795 --> 01:02:15,995
Thank you for the food.

1717
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:17,434
- Hurry and eat. - Hurry.

1718
01:02:17,435 --> 01:02:18,805
I'll take a big bite.

1719
01:02:19,465 --> 01:02:20,505
Good.

1720
01:02:21,235 --> 01:02:22,435
- Good. - That's too...

1721
01:02:23,275 --> 01:02:24,305
Good.

1722
01:02:25,105 --> 01:02:26,705
Good. Speed up.

1723
01:02:27,475 --> 01:02:28,645
We don't have time.

1724
01:02:30,145 --> 01:02:31,344
(Speeding up by grabbing the noodles tightly)

1725
01:02:31,345 --> 01:02:33,215
Good.

1726
01:02:36,585 --> 01:02:37,625
Good.

1727
01:02:38,825 --> 01:02:41,824
(The noodles get sucked in like a black hole.)

1728
01:02:41,825 --> 01:02:42,855
It's tasty.

1729
01:02:44,065 --> 01:02:46,125
- Do you want it? - But it's...

1730
01:02:46,495 --> 01:02:48,595
(He sucks in the noodles like a gold medalist.)

1731
01:02:48,995 --> 01:02:50,195
It's so good.

1732
01:02:50,905 --> 01:02:52,004
In the meantime...

1733
01:02:52,005 --> 01:02:53,135
(Tae Hyun takes a bite too.)

1734
01:02:55,175 --> 01:02:56,305
It is tasty, indeed.

1735
01:02:56,835 --> 01:03:00,104
No wonder everyone is talking...

1736
01:03:00,105 --> 01:03:01,875
about this place right now.

1737
01:03:03,345 --> 01:03:05,644
(Scraping the remaining noodles)

1738
01:03:05,645 --> 01:03:07,254
It's good. It's really good.

1739
01:03:07,255 --> 01:03:08,315
I know.

1740
01:03:08,415 --> 01:03:09,455
Okay.

1741
01:03:11,355 --> 01:03:13,754
- Let's go. - Okay. Give it to us.

1742
01:03:13,755 --> 01:03:15,425
Okay. Here's the quiz.

1743
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:18,025
(Time for Quiz)

1744
01:03:18,195 --> 01:03:20,365
Tae Hyun. Let it be the one that I know the answer to.

1745
01:03:21,035 --> 01:03:22,734
- Noodles are... - Noodles.

1746
01:03:22,735 --> 01:03:24,465
A common dish.

1747
01:03:24,835 --> 01:03:26,715
As such, they're often referred to in proverbs.

1748
01:03:27,035 --> 01:03:29,305
"Like a vinegar bottle at a noodle restaurant."

1749
01:03:29,705 --> 01:03:31,045
What does the proverb mean?

1750
01:03:33,075 --> 01:03:34,415
What is that?

1751
01:03:34,645 --> 01:03:37,015
I've never heard that proverb before.

1752
01:03:37,815 --> 01:03:40,014
- A moment ago... - I got it.

1753
01:03:40,015 --> 01:03:41,215
Hold on.

1754
01:03:41,355 --> 01:03:43,185
- "Hold on?" - What was it?

1755
01:03:43,455 --> 01:03:45,185
Hey, isn't it...

1756
01:03:45,785 --> 01:03:47,055
- is that so? - Yes.

1757
01:03:47,625 --> 01:03:50,725
When you're eating, people at the next table take it.

1758
01:03:52,565 --> 01:03:54,135
I think you're right.

1759
01:03:55,435 --> 01:03:58,205
- He has a good hunch today. - I...

1760
01:03:58,365 --> 01:04:00,134
I think it's better to trust you today.

1761
01:04:00,135 --> 01:04:01,581
That was what happened a moment ago too.

1762
01:04:01,605 --> 01:04:03,845
I really think that makes sense.

1763
01:04:04,845 --> 01:04:07,291
Let's solve the last quiz carefully even though it takes time.

1764
01:04:07,315 --> 01:04:08,745
We have to end this successfully.

1765
01:04:09,515 --> 01:04:11,084
In Sokcho,

1766
01:04:11,085 --> 01:04:13,515
it'll be hard for them to get the quiz right.

1767
01:04:13,955 --> 01:04:14,955
(They have to finish the bingo here.)

1768
01:04:14,956 --> 01:04:16,155
We're at the last place.

1769
01:04:16,585 --> 01:04:18,025
We have nowhere else to go.

1770
01:04:20,695 --> 01:04:21,695
It's here, indeed.

1771
01:04:22,455 --> 01:04:24,141
- I've been here before. - Have you been here before?

1772
01:04:24,165 --> 01:04:25,194
Have you been here before?

1773
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:26,424
- It's the last one. Let's go. - Gosh.

1774
01:04:26,425 --> 01:04:27,694
- We're here at last. - Let's go.

1775
01:04:27,695 --> 01:04:28,994
We can do it.

1776
01:04:28,995 --> 01:04:30,194
(Gangneung A: Jang kalguksu)

1777
01:04:30,195 --> 01:04:31,664
It's a restaurant Seung Ho really comes to.

1778
01:04:31,665 --> 01:04:33,404
- I've come here many times. - Awesome.

1779
01:04:33,405 --> 01:04:34,405
- Really? - Yes.

1780
01:04:34,406 --> 01:04:36,074
- I didn't realize it was you. - You probably didn't know.

1781
01:04:36,075 --> 01:04:37,075
- Hello. - Yes.

1782
01:04:37,076 --> 01:04:39,005
You should place the order, then.

1783
01:04:39,145 --> 01:04:40,675
We'll get Number Four, ma'am.

1784
01:04:40,945 --> 01:04:42,914
- Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you.

1785
01:04:42,915 --> 01:04:45,785
The taste of jang kalguksu with over 40 years of history.

1786
01:04:46,185 --> 01:04:47,255
This is it.

1787
01:04:47,285 --> 01:04:48,684
(It's kalguksu made by hand.)

1788
01:04:48,685 --> 01:04:49,984
- You made the noodles yourself. - Thank you.

1789
01:04:49,985 --> 01:04:50,985
- Yes. - Gosh.

1790
01:04:52,155 --> 01:04:53,624
We ordered a non-spicy one.

1791
01:04:53,625 --> 01:04:56,024
(It's a rule of thumb to taste the soup first.)

1792
01:04:56,025 --> 01:04:57,495
- It's as spicy as ramyeon. - But...

1793
01:04:57,695 --> 01:04:59,095
- it's still spicy. - Yes.

1794
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:00,835
(Really?)

1795
01:05:01,335 --> 01:05:03,835
(He slurps the noodles.)

1796
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,934
We can still eat, right?

1797
01:05:06,935 --> 01:05:09,035
Kalguksu with hand-cut noodles...

1798
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:11,505
has a specific texture.

1799
01:05:11,545 --> 01:05:14,474
The pressed noodles have a specific texture, right?

1800
01:05:14,475 --> 01:05:16,515
(The pressed noodles have a fun texture.)

1801
01:05:16,575 --> 01:05:18,114
- The texture is fun in the mouth. - Yes.

1802
01:05:18,115 --> 01:05:20,015
(A festival in the mouth)

1803
01:05:20,115 --> 01:05:23,955
(The regular customer eats with his face in the bowl.)

1804
01:05:27,825 --> 01:05:28,894
(Si Yang checks the missed call.)

1805
01:05:28,895 --> 01:05:30,295
I have a missed call from Tae Hyun.

1806
01:05:31,565 --> 01:05:34,835
(He calls back without thinking.)

1807
01:05:35,895 --> 01:05:37,205
Hey.

1808
01:05:37,735 --> 01:05:39,665
Tae Hyun, you sound cheerful.

1809
01:05:39,765 --> 01:05:41,974
It looks like a vinegar bottle at a noodle place.

1810
01:05:41,975 --> 01:05:43,034
What?

1811
01:05:43,035 --> 01:05:45,345
It looks like a vinegar bottle at a noodle place.

1812
01:05:47,675 --> 01:05:49,015
They must've gotten it right.

1813
01:05:49,615 --> 01:05:51,991
- Why didn't the alarm go off then? - Did they get it right?

1814
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:54,155
"It looks like a vinegar bottle at a noodle place.'

1815
01:05:54,285 --> 01:05:56,315
(Team Guys)

1816
01:05:56,885 --> 01:05:57,984
What?

1817
01:05:57,985 --> 01:06:00,055
It looks like a vinegar bottle at a noodle place.

1818
01:06:00,185 --> 01:06:02,195
(You can tell that Si Yang is flustered.)

1819
01:06:03,195 --> 01:06:04,365
Did he hang up?

1820
01:06:05,225 --> 01:06:08,434
- He hung up. There's something. - He hung up.

1821
01:06:08,435 --> 01:06:10,165
- He hung up. - There's something.

1822
01:06:10,395 --> 01:06:13,034
(Did Sang Uk get close to the answer?)

1823
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:14,375
Does it mean that it's common?

1824
01:06:14,435 --> 01:06:15,875
It's easy to find.

1825
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:17,505
Does it mean that it makes no sense.?

1826
01:06:18,075 --> 01:06:19,075
It makes no sense?

1827
01:06:19,076 --> 01:06:20,974
(He continues to give an answer that makes no sense.)

1828
01:06:20,975 --> 01:06:22,075
I have no idea.

1829
01:06:22,545 --> 01:06:24,944
Does it mean something good or bad?

1830
01:06:24,945 --> 01:06:26,245
We need to combine the answers.

1831
01:06:26,585 --> 01:06:27,685
Seriously.

1832
01:06:28,655 --> 01:06:30,854
Hey, only ten minutes remain.

1833
01:06:30,855 --> 01:06:32,054
- What? - It's uncommon.

1834
01:06:32,055 --> 01:06:33,754
- Ten minutes. - We need to answer.

1835
01:06:33,755 --> 01:06:34,855
All right. Let's go.

1836
01:06:35,955 --> 01:06:38,025
It's uncommon and hard to find.

1837
01:06:38,765 --> 01:06:41,064
It's unsuitable.

1838
01:06:41,065 --> 01:06:42,295
That's the answer.

1839
01:06:44,805 --> 01:06:46,534
The last question of the day.

1840
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,375
(They want to hide.)

1841
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:50,274
It's incorrect.

1842
01:06:50,275 --> 01:06:51,605
(They hang their heads.)

1843
01:06:52,005 --> 01:06:53,305
Does it mean that it's common?

1844
01:06:54,115 --> 01:06:55,674
I'll give you the exact answer.

1845
01:06:55,675 --> 01:06:57,884
The proverb refers to a person who moves around a lot...

1846
01:06:57,885 --> 01:06:59,514
without staying at one place.

1847
01:06:59,515 --> 01:07:01,885
It was something I had never heard about.

1848
01:07:02,915 --> 01:07:04,835
We need to hope that they mess up and come here.

1849
01:07:05,025 --> 01:07:06,284
Let's go.

1850
01:07:06,285 --> 01:07:08,424
Shall I send them the answer so that they feel good?

1851
01:07:08,425 --> 01:07:11,665
(Now, Team Handsome holds the key.)

1852
01:07:11,765 --> 01:07:13,025
(Team Handsome)

1853
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:15,934
(Team Handsome is shaken up due to the call.)

1854
01:07:15,935 --> 01:07:18,934
Perhaps he said that because we moved around.

1855
01:07:18,935 --> 01:07:20,134
They got the quiz right.

1856
01:07:20,135 --> 01:07:21,635
They called to torment us.

1857
01:07:22,105 --> 01:07:23,311
We don't need to worry about that.

1858
01:07:23,335 --> 01:07:25,015
We'll be done once we answer the question.

1859
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:27,445
- All right. - Yes.

1860
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:31,614
During King Seonjo's reign in the Joseon Dynasty,

1861
01:07:31,615 --> 01:07:33,954
the government officials opposed to someone becoming Hapjangsa,

1862
01:07:33,955 --> 01:07:35,984
a government position which involved making condiments,

1863
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:37,254
because his last name was Shin.

1864
01:07:37,255 --> 01:07:39,024
What was the reason?

1865
01:07:39,025 --> 01:07:41,254
- Because his last name was Shin? - Seriously.

1866
01:07:41,255 --> 01:07:44,194
The last name Shin can use the character that means "Spicy."

1867
01:07:44,195 --> 01:07:45,464
- Really? - Many people have that last name.

1868
01:07:45,465 --> 01:07:46,664
(Shin Seung Ho leads the team this time as well.)

1869
01:07:46,665 --> 01:07:48,335
In that case,

1870
01:07:48,435 --> 01:07:51,265
how did the other team fail to answer correctly?

1871
01:07:52,265 --> 01:07:53,985
That was the first answer to enter my mind.

1872
01:07:54,505 --> 01:07:55,775
Could there be another reason?

1873
01:07:56,035 --> 01:07:58,845
Let's think about it calmly since we have time.

1874
01:08:00,005 --> 01:08:02,205
He didn't get appointed because his last name was Shin.

1875
01:08:02,775 --> 01:08:04,295
Let me put myself in Tae Hyun's shoes.

1876
01:08:04,485 --> 01:08:06,214
"Shin can mean 'Spicy.'"

1877
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:08,385
"They must've worried that he'd made the food spicy."

1878
01:08:08,485 --> 01:08:10,405
"Your answer is incorrect." "What's the answer?"

1879
01:08:10,785 --> 01:08:12,825
"What's the answer?" What could be the answer?

1880
01:08:14,655 --> 01:08:17,024
(They don't have a clue.)

1881
01:08:17,025 --> 01:08:18,494
Is it really about spiciness?

1882
01:08:18,495 --> 01:08:19,624
(They don't have a clue.)

1883
01:08:19,625 --> 01:08:21,565
What other meanings does Shin have? "New?"

1884
01:08:22,165 --> 01:08:23,435
"The deity of the sky?"

1885
01:08:23,535 --> 01:08:25,635
"We'll film scene number 21 now."

1886
01:08:26,565 --> 01:08:27,975
That's a good guess.

1887
01:08:28,335 --> 01:08:30,775
- It's "Scene," not "Shin." - Right. That's a good guess.

1888
01:08:30,805 --> 01:08:31,845
Shin.

1889
01:08:31,905 --> 01:08:34,345
(Seung Ho writes something and shows it to him.)

1890
01:08:34,675 --> 01:08:36,774
You talked about it just now.

1891
01:08:36,775 --> 01:08:37,814
Right.

1892
01:08:37,815 --> 01:08:40,215
I think the answer is in there.

1893
01:08:41,015 --> 01:08:42,814
Hold on. Let's go over what we have one last time.

1894
01:08:42,815 --> 01:08:44,025
- Okay. - This is...

1895
01:08:44,625 --> 01:08:46,655
- This is... - Hold on.

1896
01:08:46,755 --> 01:08:47,925
I'm confused.

1897
01:08:48,295 --> 01:08:50,225
Do you know what Tae Hyun suddenly wrote...

1898
01:08:51,395 --> 01:08:53,165
in our group chatroom?

1899
01:08:54,935 --> 01:08:56,295
"Shin, the character for 'Spicy.'"

1900
01:08:56,635 --> 01:08:57,765
It came out of nowhere.

1901
01:08:58,305 --> 01:09:00,504
I bet Tae Hyun's answer was...

1902
01:09:00,505 --> 01:09:02,334
"Shin, the character for 'Spicy.'"

1903
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:04,605
- That's what I think. - Yes.

1904
01:09:04,645 --> 01:09:06,244
If we consider that,

1905
01:09:06,245 --> 01:09:08,945
the answer we have is the best bet.

1906
01:09:08,975 --> 01:09:10,785
- We'll announce our answer. - Please.

1907
01:09:10,915 --> 01:09:11,945
Okay.

1908
01:09:12,645 --> 01:09:15,855
It was a measure for the health and well-being...

1909
01:09:16,215 --> 01:09:19,085
of the royal family.

1910
01:09:21,025 --> 01:09:22,524
(The epitome of vagueness)

1911
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:24,965
- It's very comprehensive, right? - It's too comprehensive.

1912
01:09:25,095 --> 01:09:26,165
Incorrect.

1913
01:09:26,225 --> 01:09:27,764
Bye, everyone.

1914
01:09:27,765 --> 01:09:30,465
If Mr. Shin makes the condiments...

1915
01:09:30,635 --> 01:09:31,964
Did they say that they'll be spicy?

1916
01:09:31,965 --> 01:09:33,165
The taste of the condiments...

1917
01:09:33,605 --> 01:09:36,004
Did they say that it'll be sour?

1918
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,645
- Correct. - I hate the wordplay.

1919
01:09:40,245 --> 01:09:42,645
(Team Handsome fails to complete the bingo.)

1920
01:09:42,675 --> 01:09:46,645
Aren't you scared of the criticisms from the Shin Clan around Korea?

1921
01:09:48,115 --> 01:09:49,815
Will I be Sour Seung Ho from now on?

1922
01:09:50,455 --> 01:09:51,654
They said that the taste would be sour.

1923
01:09:51,655 --> 01:09:53,184
(They move to determine the final penalty-taker!)

1924
01:09:53,185 --> 01:09:54,995
What did Mr. Shin do wrong?

1925
01:09:55,155 --> 01:09:57,324
We're on the same level.

1926
01:09:57,325 --> 01:10:01,165
Seriously. Today's race was legendary.

1927
01:10:01,665 --> 01:10:02,965
Sung Hoon, apologize.

1928
01:10:03,595 --> 01:10:04,835
The gameboard is in tatters.

1929
01:10:06,205 --> 01:10:07,781
How is that my fault? It isn't my fault.

1930
01:10:07,805 --> 01:10:10,975
You stepped on it and pulled it apart.

1931
01:10:11,505 --> 01:10:13,905
We let it go since it was you, but it was against the rules.

1932
01:10:14,345 --> 01:10:15,914
Sure. It was problematic.

1933
01:10:15,915 --> 01:10:17,075
- Let's begin. - Okay.

1934
01:10:17,245 --> 01:10:18,314
(Let's go home.)

1935
01:10:18,315 --> 01:10:19,315
I'm exhausted.

1936
01:10:19,316 --> 01:10:22,114
Five people will be exempt and one person will take the penalty.

1937
01:10:22,115 --> 01:10:24,855
Okay. Instead of solving a quiz,

1938
01:10:24,955 --> 01:10:26,585
can't we play rock-paper-scissors?

1939
01:10:27,325 --> 01:10:30,054
Then I'll be able to participate.

1940
01:10:30,055 --> 01:10:32,194
Quiz is hard because I don't know the history.

1941
01:10:32,195 --> 01:10:33,524
I haven't studied.

1942
01:10:33,525 --> 01:10:35,085
I don't know much about Korean history.

1943
01:10:35,465 --> 01:10:37,094
- I can't speak Korean well. - Sung Hoon.

1944
01:10:37,095 --> 01:10:38,364
Why are you doing this toward the end?

1945
01:10:38,365 --> 01:10:40,304
- I'm just expressing myself. - Sung Hoon.

1946
01:10:40,305 --> 01:10:41,474
Why did you become sullen?

1947
01:10:41,475 --> 01:10:43,605
- Come on. - Didn't he speak fluently just now?

1948
01:10:44,105 --> 01:10:45,975
His sentences were perfect just now.

1949
01:10:46,905 --> 01:10:49,674
Isn't that right? If I have to solve a quiz...

1950
01:10:49,675 --> 01:10:51,114
(Intimidated)

1951
01:10:51,115 --> 01:10:52,115
Isn't that right?

1952
01:10:52,285 --> 01:10:55,085
If he answers correctly, he'll feel ecstatic.

1953
01:10:55,115 --> 01:10:56,754
He'll be excited.

1954
01:10:56,755 --> 01:10:58,255
He'll feel ecstatic.

1955
01:10:58,455 --> 01:11:01,155
- I'll give you the first question. - Okay.

1956
01:11:01,925 --> 01:11:04,164
You had potato dough soup.

1957
01:11:04,165 --> 01:11:05,764
- Yes. - The main ingredient, potato,

1958
01:11:05,765 --> 01:11:07,535
can be cooked in various ways.

1959
01:11:07,565 --> 01:11:11,234
Among them, the potato chip was invented in 1853...

1960
01:11:11,235 --> 01:11:14,035
by an American hotel chef.

1961
01:11:14,375 --> 01:11:17,775
Back then, French fries were popular.

1962
01:11:17,875 --> 01:11:21,174
Because one customer continued to complain.

1963
01:11:21,175 --> 01:11:23,615
The potato chip came to be.

1964
01:11:24,445 --> 01:11:26,444
- What was the complaint? - Let me answer.

1965
01:11:26,445 --> 01:11:27,584
(What was the complaint?)

1966
01:11:27,585 --> 01:11:29,225
Let me answer. The pieces were too thick.

1967
01:11:29,615 --> 01:11:30,955
I read it in a book.

1968
01:11:31,585 --> 01:11:32,754
(Everyone freezes.)

1969
01:11:32,755 --> 01:11:33,825
I read it in a book.

1970
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,824
The customer kept asking for thinner pieces,

1971
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:36,994
so the chef became annoyed and made them extremely thin.

1972
01:11:36,995 --> 01:11:38,464
- Then the customer was satisfied. - I see that it's simple.

1973
01:11:38,465 --> 01:11:39,494
That's exactly it.

1974
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:40,934
- You must be right. - Yi Kyung, you're correct.

1975
01:11:40,935 --> 01:11:41,935
Okay.

1976
01:11:41,936 --> 01:11:43,341
- The pieces were too thick? - I read it in a book.

1977
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:44,534
I read it in a book.

1978
01:11:44,535 --> 01:11:46,504
- You read it in a book? - Yes.

1979
01:11:46,505 --> 01:11:47,811
- Let's move on to the next one. - The next one.

1980
01:11:47,835 --> 01:11:49,405
It was no fun whatsoever.

1981
01:11:50,735 --> 01:11:52,374
- What? - It was no fun, right?

1982
01:11:52,375 --> 01:11:54,075
Rock-paper-scissors is more fun.

1983
01:11:54,675 --> 01:11:56,574
- If it isn't fun... - It makes people anticipate.

1984
01:11:56,575 --> 01:11:58,044
Rock-paper-scissors makes people anticipate.

1985
01:11:58,045 --> 01:11:59,815
- It's more fun. - I read it in a book.

1986
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:02,684
- Shall I ask the next question? - Of course.

1987
01:12:02,685 --> 01:12:03,685
Let's begin.

1988
01:12:03,686 --> 01:12:06,085
Jjamppong originated in Nagasaki, Japan.

1989
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,654
- It's a question about Japan. - Yes.

1990
01:12:07,655 --> 01:12:10,524
- It's called champon in Nagasaki. - That's right.

1991
01:12:10,525 --> 01:12:13,664
Chinese people who moved there developed the menu.

1992
01:12:13,665 --> 01:12:15,334
- They moved to Nagasaki. - Yes.

1993
01:12:15,335 --> 01:12:16,864
They added the seafood...

1994
01:12:16,865 --> 01:12:19,634
that could be found easily in the port city, Nagasaki.

1995
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:22,134
For Chinese immigrants and "Blank,"

1996
01:12:22,135 --> 01:12:24,404
they sold cheap and hearty dish...

1997
01:12:24,405 --> 01:12:25,874
- of jjamppong. - "Blank."

1998
01:12:25,875 --> 01:12:27,105
What goes in the blank?

1999
01:12:27,845 --> 01:12:29,045
Migrant workers?

2000
01:12:30,115 --> 01:12:32,284
- Incorrect. - Of course. It was too easy.

2001
01:12:32,285 --> 01:12:34,085
If you think about it...

2002
01:12:34,955 --> 01:12:36,554
(Will he get it right?)

2003
01:12:36,555 --> 01:12:37,885
(Raising his hand)

2004
01:12:38,055 --> 01:12:42,525
People who work in ships.

2005
01:12:42,655 --> 01:12:43,994
- Sailors? - What?

2006
01:12:43,995 --> 01:12:45,364
- Incorrect. - What was it called?

2007
01:12:45,365 --> 01:12:47,294
You need to give a precise answer.

2008
01:12:47,295 --> 01:12:48,864
- I meant fishermen. - Fishermen?

2009
01:12:48,865 --> 01:12:51,105
- "Fishermen" is incorrect. - Both "Fishermen..."

2010
01:12:51,305 --> 01:12:52,935
and "Migrant workers" are incorrect.

2011
01:12:53,565 --> 01:12:54,835
I'll give it a go.

2012
01:12:55,205 --> 01:12:57,005
- Koreans. - Koreans?

2013
01:12:57,035 --> 01:12:58,645
- Incorrect. - Is it incorrect?

2014
01:12:58,675 --> 01:12:59,845
It was plausible.

2015
01:13:00,275 --> 01:13:01,345
Chinese immigrants...

2016
01:13:02,015 --> 01:13:03,015
and "Blank."

2017
01:13:03,016 --> 01:13:04,145
(Sang Uk thinks.)

2018
01:13:04,545 --> 01:13:05,714
Let's take turns and guess.

2019
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:06,944
- Okay. - We don't know anyway.

2020
01:13:06,945 --> 01:13:08,455
- Let's guess. - Then...

2021
01:13:08,655 --> 01:13:09,754
how about "Higher-ups?"

2022
01:13:09,755 --> 01:13:11,085
"Higher-ups" is incorrect.

2023
01:13:11,655 --> 01:13:13,755
You should go with "Servants."

2024
01:13:16,225 --> 01:13:19,895
- It's the opposite. - People who are far from the sea.

2025
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:21,794
- What's that? - What's that?

2026
01:13:21,795 --> 01:13:23,395
People who are far from the sea?

2027
01:13:23,665 --> 01:13:25,205
In any case, it's incorrect.

2028
01:13:25,705 --> 01:13:26,735
Is there a hint?

2029
01:13:27,305 --> 01:13:29,405
Hearty and cheap.

2030
01:13:30,405 --> 01:13:32,004
- Hearty and cheap. - Are you talking about the people?

2031
01:13:32,005 --> 01:13:33,774
You're talking about Nagasaki champon.

2032
01:13:33,775 --> 01:13:35,375
It's hearty and cheap.

2033
01:13:35,445 --> 01:13:37,114
For whom was this dish made?

2034
01:13:37,115 --> 01:13:38,544
(Racking his brain)

2035
01:13:38,545 --> 01:13:39,785
In that case...

2036
01:13:41,015 --> 01:13:44,525
If it's hearty, then the answer has to be...

2037
01:13:45,055 --> 01:13:46,825
Athletes. Students.

2038
01:13:48,195 --> 01:13:49,454
Athletes. Students.

2039
01:13:49,455 --> 01:13:50,655
Sung Hoon, choose one.

2040
01:13:51,665 --> 01:13:52,824
- They're the same. - Choose one.

2041
01:13:52,825 --> 01:13:53,994
Athlete-students.

2042
01:13:53,995 --> 01:13:55,864
- What's that? - Listen.

2043
01:13:55,865 --> 01:13:57,065
Athlete-students.

2044
01:13:57,765 --> 01:13:59,104
- What's that? - What?

2045
01:13:59,105 --> 01:14:00,105
Are they students...

2046
01:14:00,106 --> 01:14:01,704
in the athletic department?

2047
01:14:01,705 --> 01:14:04,644
- Athlete-students. It's one. - Don't be ridiculous.

2048
01:14:04,645 --> 01:14:06,444
Athletes or students?

2049
01:14:06,445 --> 01:14:07,445
You must choose one.

2050
01:14:07,446 --> 01:14:08,874
- Really? - I think it's 1 of the 2.

2051
01:14:08,875 --> 01:14:10,344
- Otherwise, you lose your chance. - It's 1 of the 2.

2052
01:14:10,345 --> 01:14:12,144
Athletes or students.

2053
01:14:12,145 --> 01:14:13,784
You know how it is. You need to go, right?

2054
01:14:13,785 --> 01:14:15,505
- I know the answer. - Three people remain.

2055
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:17,884
- Students. - Let me answer.

2056
01:14:17,885 --> 01:14:20,024
- Will you go with "Athletes?" - Athletes.

2057
01:14:20,025 --> 01:14:22,755
- How about you? - I wanted to choose "Athletes."

2058
01:14:23,355 --> 01:14:24,495
The answer is...

2059
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:26,125
Students.

2060
01:14:27,495 --> 01:14:30,335
- Middle-aged man. - See? He's ecstatic.

2061
01:14:31,005 --> 01:14:32,034
He's ecstatic.

2062
01:14:32,035 --> 01:14:33,811
- Don't play rock-paper-scissors. - Why did he complain earlier?

2063
01:14:33,835 --> 01:14:35,235
He's happy.

2064
01:14:35,505 --> 01:14:36,505
(The miraculous game changer)

2065
01:14:36,506 --> 01:14:37,675
Middle-aged man.

2066
01:14:38,545 --> 01:14:39,645
He got us.

2067
01:14:39,745 --> 01:14:41,144
Did you guess?

2068
01:14:41,145 --> 01:14:42,775
- Students. - Did you guess?

2069
01:14:43,075 --> 01:14:45,844
That's an old story of Nagasaki champon.

2070
01:14:45,845 --> 01:14:47,854
- It was made for students. - Sung Hoon is incredible.

2071
01:14:47,855 --> 01:14:51,224
- International students. - It's the same as last time.

2072
01:14:51,225 --> 01:14:52,724
- International students. - International students?

2073
01:14:52,725 --> 01:14:53,884
They didn't have much money.

2074
01:14:53,885 --> 01:14:55,131
(When you study abroad, you don't have much money.)

2075
01:14:55,155 --> 01:14:56,254
(Leaning back)

2076
01:14:56,255 --> 01:14:58,125
Sung Hoon and I became relaxed.

2077
01:14:58,325 --> 01:15:00,324
- Si Yang hasn't been exempt yet. - That's right.

2078
01:15:00,325 --> 01:15:02,265
Four people remain.

2079
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:05,535
- Please give us the next question. - It's the same situation.

2080
01:15:05,635 --> 01:15:07,064
You had Hamheung naengmyeon.

2081
01:15:07,065 --> 01:15:10,435
Hamheung is a city by the East Sea in South Hamgyong Province.

2082
01:15:11,005 --> 01:15:14,944
In North Korea, an apartment is "A multi-story housing complex."

2083
01:15:14,945 --> 01:15:17,214
- A multi-story housing complex. - A multi-story housing complex.

2084
01:15:17,215 --> 01:15:19,945
A parking lot is "A car yard."

2085
01:15:20,845 --> 01:15:25,354
In that case, what's "High-technology service center..."

2086
01:15:25,355 --> 01:15:26,684
of North Korea?

2087
01:15:26,685 --> 01:15:28,155
High-technology service center?

2088
01:15:29,825 --> 01:15:32,064
- Service. Service center. - High-technology.

2089
01:15:32,065 --> 01:15:33,394
Technology.

2090
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:34,935
- Let me answer. - What?

2091
01:15:35,835 --> 01:15:37,434
Computer.

2092
01:15:37,435 --> 01:15:38,604
(Computer?)

2093
01:15:38,605 --> 01:15:40,535
- Computer. - I think it's incorrect.

2094
01:15:40,765 --> 01:15:43,404
(But I have a hunch.)

2095
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:44,744
"Computer" wasn't my answer.

2096
01:15:44,745 --> 01:15:46,705
- Computer? - Well...

2097
01:15:47,005 --> 01:15:48,275
Someone who makes computers.

2098
01:15:48,675 --> 01:15:49,845
Incorrect.

2099
01:15:49,875 --> 01:15:51,915
It doesn't refer to a person.

2100
01:15:52,285 --> 01:15:55,415
What's something like Silicon Valley in Korea?

2101
01:15:56,115 --> 01:15:58,224
What should I call it?

2102
01:15:58,225 --> 01:16:00,025
- Do you have a hunch? - I have a hunch.

2103
01:16:00,585 --> 01:16:02,624
I have two options.

2104
01:16:02,625 --> 01:16:04,724
- Please tell me one. - I'll answer if he gets it wrong.

2105
01:16:04,725 --> 01:16:06,124
(Watch out for the hyenas.)

2106
01:16:06,125 --> 01:16:08,365
I'll tell you if it sounds plausible.

2107
01:16:08,395 --> 01:16:09,635
Firstly...

2108
01:16:10,435 --> 01:16:11,865
I'll give it a go.

2109
01:16:12,205 --> 01:16:13,765
Automobile repair shop.

2110
01:16:13,865 --> 01:16:15,234
Automobile repair shop?

2111
01:16:15,235 --> 01:16:16,374
(Automobile repair shop)

2112
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:17,615
- Incorrect. - Is it incorrect?

2113
01:16:18,545 --> 01:16:19,804
High-technology service center?

2114
01:16:19,805 --> 01:16:21,674
- In North Korea... - High-technology service center?

2115
01:16:21,675 --> 01:16:23,675
High-technology service center.

2116
01:16:23,745 --> 01:16:25,584
I'll try my answer before we receive a hint.

2117
01:16:25,585 --> 01:16:26,815
- Internet cafe. - Correct.

2118
01:16:27,285 --> 01:16:28,415
It's correct.

2119
01:16:30,015 --> 01:16:31,485
It's an internet cafe.

2120
01:16:31,985 --> 01:16:33,925
- That's right. - Service center.

2121
01:16:34,255 --> 01:16:35,255
- Service center. - Internet cafe?
It's an internet cafe.

2122
01:16:36,256 --> 01:16:38,164
- Service center. - You got out of it expertly.

2123
01:16:38,165 --> 01:16:39,924
Seung Ho dodged a penalty again.

2124
01:16:39,925 --> 01:16:41,694
- Internet cafe. - Seriously,

2125
01:16:41,695 --> 01:16:43,794
I only wanted to let it out.

2126
01:16:43,795 --> 01:16:45,804
- I can't believe it. - Three people remain.

2127
01:16:45,805 --> 01:16:47,775
Let's change the seats.

2128
01:16:48,005 --> 01:16:50,034
Sung Hoon and Seung Ho, come here.

2129
01:16:50,035 --> 01:16:51,174
It's this situation again.

2130
01:16:51,175 --> 01:16:53,205
Why do they call it "A service center?"

2131
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:54,944
Isn't it hilarious? Three people remain.

2132
01:16:54,945 --> 01:16:56,114
Will it be Sang Uk again?

2133
01:16:56,115 --> 01:16:58,584
Will Tae Hyun give himself a penalty for the first time?

2134
01:16:58,585 --> 01:17:00,284
Will it be a guest?

2135
01:17:00,285 --> 01:17:01,591
(People who will go home: Yi Kyung, Sung Hoon, and Seung Ho)

2136
01:17:01,615 --> 01:17:02,775
- Shall we begin? - Let's go.

2137
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:06,655
When people made noodles back in the day,

2138
01:17:06,855 --> 01:17:09,094
they put the dough inside a mold and pushed down with a mortar...

2139
01:17:09,095 --> 01:17:11,395
- to make the noodles fall. - They fell into the pot.

2140
01:17:12,195 --> 01:17:15,264
When they used the mold for a long time,

2141
01:17:15,265 --> 01:17:16,895
"Blank" exploded due to pressure.

2142
01:17:17,135 --> 01:17:20,464
Because of that, you say that "Blank" explodes...

2143
01:17:20,465 --> 01:17:22,334
when you become frustrated since something has gone awry.

2144
01:17:22,335 --> 01:17:23,635
- What's... - Let me answer.

2145
01:17:23,775 --> 01:17:25,544
- I was faster. - He was faster.

2146
01:17:25,545 --> 01:17:26,574
Who was faster?

2147
01:17:26,575 --> 01:17:28,415
Since something has gone awry.

2148
01:17:28,575 --> 01:17:30,044
(Si Yang said it 1st.)

2149
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:31,185
Who was faster?

2150
01:17:31,615 --> 01:17:33,045
- Si Yang. - Ulhwatong.

2151
01:17:33,245 --> 01:17:34,345
Ulhwatong.

2152
01:17:35,185 --> 01:17:37,355
- Incorrect. - Is it incorrect?

2153
01:17:37,455 --> 01:17:38,524
That's...

2154
01:17:38,525 --> 01:17:40,524
- Let me answer. - "Ulhwatong" is correct.

2155
01:17:40,525 --> 01:17:42,795
Let me answer. Sok exploded.

2156
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:45,394
"Sok exploded" is incorrect.

2157
01:17:45,395 --> 01:17:46,425
What?

2158
01:17:47,325 --> 01:17:48,565
I figured it out.

2159
01:17:50,065 --> 01:17:51,535
Isn't it "Ulhwatong?"

2160
01:17:51,705 --> 01:17:53,405
- My guess was "Ulhwatong" too. - I see.

2161
01:17:53,905 --> 01:17:55,474
When something goes awry...

2162
01:17:55,475 --> 01:17:56,634
(Answer: Buntong)

2163
01:17:56,635 --> 01:17:58,404
- It's correct. - That's right.

2164
01:17:58,405 --> 01:18:00,204
I got it right. I would've answered correctly.

2165
01:18:00,205 --> 01:18:02,274
Yes. Do you know what it is?

2166
01:18:02,275 --> 01:18:04,544
We can think better since the distance helps us relax.

2167
01:18:04,545 --> 01:18:05,614
Shall I put some distance?

2168
01:18:05,615 --> 01:18:07,345
(Backing off right away)

2169
01:18:07,445 --> 01:18:08,614
Bak exploded.

2170
01:18:08,615 --> 01:18:09,914
(Bak exploded.)

2171
01:18:09,915 --> 01:18:12,355
What exploded? You're angry.

2172
01:18:12,485 --> 01:18:13,485
This is the situation.

2173
01:18:13,486 --> 01:18:14,654
- Tae Hyun is serious. - You're frustrated.

2174
01:18:14,655 --> 01:18:16,055
You're frustrated.

2175
01:18:16,895 --> 01:18:18,724
(The Bermuda Triangle of answers)

2176
01:18:18,725 --> 01:18:20,024
Hurry up and answer.

2177
01:18:20,025 --> 01:18:21,665
Hold on.

2178
01:18:23,165 --> 01:18:24,665
He's so cautious.

2179
01:18:25,335 --> 01:18:27,134
I don't have a clue.

2180
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:28,475
(I don't have a clue.)

2181
01:18:29,005 --> 01:18:30,275
- Do you know? - Buntong?

2182
01:18:30,775 --> 01:18:32,244
- Do you know? - Buntong?

2183
01:18:32,245 --> 01:18:33,444
(Buntong)

2184
01:18:33,445 --> 01:18:34,505
Buntong?

2185
01:18:34,845 --> 01:18:35,915
What was that?

2186
01:18:36,345 --> 01:18:37,514
Buntong?

2187
01:18:37,515 --> 01:18:38,584
(Buntong)

2188
01:18:38,585 --> 01:18:39,784
- What was that? - Sang Uk,

2189
01:18:39,785 --> 01:18:40,884
you're correct.

2190
01:18:40,885 --> 01:18:42,655
(Buntong)

2191
01:18:42,755 --> 01:18:44,514
(Sang Uk passed.)

2192
01:18:44,515 --> 01:18:45,725
Buntong.

2193
01:18:45,955 --> 01:18:47,585
Sang Uk escaped.

2194
01:18:47,825 --> 01:18:49,194
- Is it "Buntong?" - Buntong.

2195
01:18:49,195 --> 01:18:50,254
That's right. It's "Buntong."

2196
01:18:50,255 --> 01:18:51,724
- What did you have in mind? - Buntong.

2197
01:18:51,725 --> 01:18:53,565
- What did you have in mind? - As for me,

2198
01:18:53,595 --> 01:18:55,165
I heard someone say, "Bak exploded."

2199
01:18:55,195 --> 01:18:57,394
I thought that was the answer.

2200
01:18:57,395 --> 01:18:58,765
Bak exploded.

2201
01:18:59,105 --> 01:19:01,804
- Buntong. - How did you think of "Buntong?"

2202
01:19:01,805 --> 01:19:04,034
- Buntong exploded. - Buntong exploded. Suddenly,

2203
01:19:04,035 --> 01:19:06,204
- it entered my mind. - It didn't occur to me.

2204
01:19:06,205 --> 01:19:07,945
I've never heard of it.

2205
01:19:08,175 --> 01:19:11,884
- My heart aches for Si Yang. - Why?

2206
01:19:11,885 --> 01:19:14,114
It's funny, but my heart aches for him.

2207
01:19:14,115 --> 01:19:16,084
- Did he answer well earlier? - Yi Kyung,

2208
01:19:16,085 --> 01:19:18,061
Si Yang, and I were on the same team today, right?

2209
01:19:18,085 --> 01:19:20,924
- Unfortunately... - Was he supposed to answer?

2210
01:19:20,925 --> 01:19:22,495
Whenever we got a question,

2211
01:19:23,125 --> 01:19:24,625
he couldn't get a sense of it.

2212
01:19:25,225 --> 01:19:26,864
You know, it was...

2213
01:19:26,865 --> 01:19:29,134
as if someone had blocked that part of his brain.

2214
01:19:29,135 --> 01:19:31,434
He was like an ally who was shooting at us.

2215
01:19:31,435 --> 01:19:32,435
(He was like an ally who was shooting at us.)

2216
01:19:32,436 --> 01:19:34,674
We're hoping that Si Yang...

2217
01:19:34,675 --> 01:19:36,434
will get a sense of the question.

2218
01:19:36,435 --> 01:19:37,634
He might do well since it's the last time.

2219
01:19:37,635 --> 01:19:39,944
Will Tae Hyun get the penalty two weeks in a row?

2220
01:19:39,945 --> 01:19:41,044
- Again? - Will it be a guest?

2221
01:19:41,045 --> 01:19:42,774
It's all because of Jang Hyuk.

2222
01:19:42,775 --> 01:19:43,814
(The last question)

2223
01:19:43,815 --> 01:19:45,735
It's hard if you get the penalty twice in a row.

2224
01:19:45,945 --> 01:19:47,244
I'm so nervous.

2225
01:19:47,245 --> 01:19:50,885
(They welcome the question in a nervous state.)

2226
01:19:52,725 --> 01:19:55,324
Gompyo Flour of D Milling Company...

2227
01:19:55,325 --> 01:19:56,754
(Gompyo Flour of D Milling Company)

2228
01:19:56,755 --> 01:20:00,765
appeared in 1952 when there wasn't a lot of food.

2229
01:20:01,335 --> 01:20:06,065
Back then, "Bear" was a trademark that was only used for home use.

2230
01:20:07,235 --> 01:20:10,374
As for the flour for business use of making bread and snacks,

2231
01:20:10,375 --> 01:20:12,545
"Blank" was used as a trademark.

2232
01:20:13,275 --> 01:20:15,544
- What goes in the blank? - Not bear.

2233
01:20:15,545 --> 01:20:17,444
- Something else was used. - Yes.

2234
01:20:17,445 --> 01:20:18,614
Let me answer. Pig?

2235
01:20:18,615 --> 01:20:21,114
"Pig" is incorrect.

2236
01:20:21,115 --> 01:20:22,684
You startled me.

2237
01:20:22,685 --> 01:20:24,684
(Si Yang was startled.)

2238
01:20:24,685 --> 01:20:25,884
Not bear.

2239
01:20:25,885 --> 01:20:28,794
Just list the animals. We'll get there in the end.

2240
01:20:28,795 --> 01:20:30,325
It has to be an animal.

2241
01:20:30,925 --> 01:20:32,925
- Really? - Of course.

2242
01:20:33,265 --> 01:20:35,394
What? Didn't you know that?

2243
01:20:35,395 --> 01:20:36,934
- I told you so. - Tae Hyun.

2244
01:20:36,935 --> 01:20:38,164
- Didn't he know that? - Listen.

2245
01:20:38,165 --> 01:20:40,234
- He can't even get close. - For goodness' sake.

2246
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:41,504
I told you so.

2247
01:20:41,505 --> 01:20:43,234
Tae Hyun, you got him closer.

2248
01:20:43,235 --> 01:20:44,844
Hold on.

2249
01:20:44,845 --> 01:20:46,705
If it isn't a pig...

2250
01:20:47,575 --> 01:20:48,874
- Hurry up and answer. - Hold on.

2251
01:20:48,875 --> 01:20:50,014
Hey.

2252
01:20:50,015 --> 01:20:52,415
- Si Yang. - I got a chance after a while.

2253
01:20:52,585 --> 01:20:55,285
You don't need to think. Just try any answers.

2254
01:20:55,515 --> 01:20:57,655
Gompyo Flour has a polar bear on the package.

2255
01:20:58,055 --> 01:21:01,324
He takes a wrong approach like this.

2256
01:21:01,325 --> 01:21:04,765
He'll suddenly go, "Antarctic bear" or "Asian black bear."

2257
01:21:05,125 --> 01:21:07,925
He'll go to King Sejong Station in the Antarctic.

2258
01:21:08,095 --> 01:21:10,534
For home use, the bear was used.

2259
01:21:10,535 --> 01:21:12,265
For industrial use...

2260
01:21:13,005 --> 01:21:14,265
I know. Dog.

2261
01:21:15,005 --> 01:21:16,205
- Dog. - Dog.

2262
01:21:16,435 --> 01:21:17,435
- Incorrect. - Dog?

2263
01:21:17,436 --> 01:21:19,944
- Let me answer. Tiger. - Tiger?

2264
01:21:19,945 --> 01:21:21,744
- Please say that it's incorrect. - I took a wild guess.

2265
01:21:21,745 --> 01:21:22,814
- Is it incorrect? - That's the only way.

2266
01:21:22,815 --> 01:21:24,574
- "Tiger" is incorrect. - Okay.

2267
01:21:24,575 --> 01:21:26,285
If "Tiger" is incorrect, is it "Lion?"

2268
01:21:27,145 --> 01:21:29,585
It'll be funnier to go with "Elephant."

2269
01:21:29,785 --> 01:21:31,015
It can't be "Lion."

2270
01:21:31,085 --> 01:21:32,425
- Tiger. - Elephant?

2271
01:21:32,685 --> 01:21:33,824
(Elephant?)

2272
01:21:33,825 --> 01:21:35,224
It sounds plausible.

2273
01:21:35,225 --> 01:21:36,794
(Elephant?)

2274
01:21:36,795 --> 01:21:37,824
He has a hunch.

2275
01:21:37,825 --> 01:21:39,295
- Chicken. - Chicken?

2276
01:21:39,365 --> 01:21:40,665
It's incorrect.

2277
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:42,064
- Let me answer. Elephant. - Elephant.

2278
01:21:42,065 --> 01:21:44,535
I said "Let me answer" first. Elephant.

2279
01:21:44,635 --> 01:21:46,534
- Didn't we say it together? - Who was faster?

2280
01:21:46,535 --> 01:21:47,964
Let me answer. Elephant.

2281
01:21:47,965 --> 01:21:49,034
(They ask the production crew to check the video.)

2282
01:21:49,035 --> 01:21:51,034
- How about the next question? - We should move on.

2283
01:21:51,035 --> 01:21:52,705
Check the video.

2284
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:55,345
(Tae Hyun shouted "Let me answer" first.)

2285
01:21:55,715 --> 01:21:57,775
(Si Yang shouted "Elephant" first.)

2286
01:21:58,145 --> 01:22:00,685
(It's difficult to say who has the priority.)

2287
01:22:00,915 --> 01:22:03,054
- "Elephant" must be correct. - Yes. "Elephant" must be correct.

2288
01:22:03,055 --> 01:22:04,415
You were correct.

2289
01:22:04,485 --> 01:22:06,855
I got goosebumps.

2290
01:22:07,355 --> 01:22:08,854
I guess I have no wits.

2291
01:22:08,855 --> 01:22:12,024
- Don't say that. Get the next one. - You can do it.

2292
01:22:12,025 --> 01:22:14,495
- The last one. - The last question.

2293
01:22:15,265 --> 01:22:17,434
- Si Yang. - Hold on.

2294
01:22:17,435 --> 01:22:19,164
- Sit down. - Hold on.

2295
01:22:19,165 --> 01:22:21,405
I need to take my cat to the vet tomorrow.

2296
01:22:21,605 --> 01:22:24,075
The loser needs to work in Pyeongchang tomorrow morning.

2297
01:22:24,775 --> 01:22:27,374
- Gosh. - I know this nerve-racking moment.

2298
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:29,144
The loser will get annoyed tomorrow.

2299
01:22:29,145 --> 01:22:30,221
(The match of the bottom members is fierce.)

2300
01:22:30,245 --> 01:22:31,744
In Pyeongchang, Gangwon Province,

2301
01:22:31,745 --> 01:22:34,714
this climate phenomenon...

2302
01:22:34,715 --> 01:22:37,155
has never occurred.

2303
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:40,455
- In Pyeongchang? - What can't be seen in Pyeongchang?

2304
01:22:41,185 --> 01:22:43,094
Gosh, a climate phenomenon?

2305
01:22:43,095 --> 01:22:46,194
So Pyeongchang doesn't have this climate phenomenon.

2306
01:22:46,195 --> 01:22:47,925
- Rainbow? - Rainbow?

2307
01:22:47,995 --> 01:22:49,165
- No way. - Incorrect.

2308
01:22:49,565 --> 01:22:50,864
Tae Hyun. Drought.

2309
01:22:50,865 --> 01:22:52,204
(Drought?)

2310
01:22:52,205 --> 01:22:53,304
Incorrect.

2311
01:22:53,305 --> 01:22:55,586
Si Yang, you need to answer. Get a sense of the question.

2312
01:22:55,675 --> 01:22:56,934
Si Yang. Typhoon.

2313
01:22:56,935 --> 01:22:58,405
"Typhoon" is incorrect.

2314
01:22:59,375 --> 01:23:01,145
- I can't get a sense. - Tae Yang. Flood.

2315
01:23:01,645 --> 01:23:03,715
- Incorrect. - Tae Hyun, not Tae Yang.

2316
01:23:03,945 --> 01:23:05,544
Si Yang. Flood.

2317
01:23:05,545 --> 01:23:06,715
(Si Yang! Flood.)

2318
01:23:07,145 --> 01:23:08,315
"Flood" is incorrect.

2319
01:23:09,155 --> 01:23:10,585
Tae Hyun. Sun shower.

2320
01:23:10,615 --> 01:23:12,055
"Sun shower" is incorrect.

2321
01:23:13,085 --> 01:23:14,255
Si Yang.

2322
01:23:14,725 --> 01:23:15,994
What was it called?

2323
01:23:15,995 --> 01:23:17,724
- Say it. - One, two...

2324
01:23:17,725 --> 01:23:19,164
- Incorrect. - Daefrica. That can't be it.

2325
01:23:19,165 --> 01:23:20,664
Tae Hyun. Tropical night.

2326
01:23:20,665 --> 01:23:21,734
Correct.

2327
01:23:21,735 --> 01:23:23,065
(Tropical night)

2328
01:23:23,135 --> 01:23:24,734
Tae Hyun. Tropical night.

2329
01:23:24,735 --> 01:23:25,735
Correct.

2330
01:23:25,736 --> 01:23:27,204
(Tae Hyun is correct.)

2331
01:23:27,205 --> 01:23:28,774
I did it again.

2332
01:23:28,775 --> 01:23:33,104
(Work hard. I'll go home.)

2333
01:23:33,105 --> 01:23:35,245
- I did it again. - I couldn't think of the word.

2334
01:23:35,975 --> 01:23:37,174
Wait, Si Yang.

2335
01:23:37,175 --> 01:23:39,544
Was that the word you had in mind? Daefrica. Heat in Daegu.

2336
01:23:39,545 --> 01:23:41,784
I couldn't think of the word.

2337
01:23:41,785 --> 01:23:43,055
Si Yang...

2338
01:23:43,255 --> 01:23:44,514
thought about the hot weather.

2339
01:23:44,515 --> 01:23:46,525
- So I said, "Daefrica." - Daefrica.

2340
01:23:46,925 --> 01:23:48,224
I couldn't think of the word.

2341
01:23:48,225 --> 01:23:51,665
Why is it so hard to think of the word?

2342
01:23:52,325 --> 01:23:53,525
Congratulations.

2343
01:23:53,565 --> 01:23:54,834
Congratulations.

2344
01:23:54,835 --> 01:23:56,764
- Thank you for your hard work. - Thank you.

2345
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:58,534
How was your experience? We're curious.

2346
01:23:58,535 --> 01:24:00,264
- I had so much fun. Seriously. - Thank goodness.

2347
01:24:00,265 --> 01:24:02,374
It was my first time to laugh so much...

2348
01:24:02,375 --> 01:24:04,475
while filming a variety show.

2349
01:24:04,635 --> 01:24:07,504
One shocking discovery was...

2350
01:24:07,505 --> 01:24:09,474
that I couldn't get a sense of things.

2351
01:24:09,475 --> 01:24:11,545
(I couldn't get a sense of things.)

2352
01:24:12,685 --> 01:24:15,114
You and Sung Hoon are the best guests.

2353
01:24:15,115 --> 01:24:17,715
We hate it when they invite people who are too smart.

2354
01:24:18,015 --> 01:24:20,685
I can get a sense of things when I visit again.

2355
01:24:23,895 --> 01:24:27,525
(Next morning)

2356
01:24:27,995 --> 01:24:29,134
- Hello. - Welcome.

2357
01:24:29,135 --> 01:24:30,995
- Hello. - Hello.

2358
01:24:31,035 --> 01:24:32,264
Why did you place last...

2359
01:24:32,265 --> 01:24:34,235
to have a hard time here?

2360
01:24:34,565 --> 01:24:35,935
(Laughing)

2361
01:24:36,105 --> 01:24:37,634
You should've done better.

2362
01:24:37,635 --> 01:24:38,805
(You should've done better.)

2363
01:24:38,905 --> 01:24:41,274
- These are radishes. - Today...

2364
01:24:41,275 --> 01:24:42,745
Have you peeled radishes before?

2365
01:24:43,145 --> 01:24:44,414
Hold it like this.

2366
01:24:44,415 --> 01:24:45,544
That's crooked.

2367
01:24:45,545 --> 01:24:47,945
If you hold it like that, you won't be able to peel it well.

2368
01:24:48,015 --> 01:24:49,614
Doing it like this will be better.

2369
01:24:49,615 --> 01:24:50,854
Yes. There you go.

2370
01:24:50,855 --> 01:24:52,655
Make sure you don't hurt your hand.

2371
01:24:52,785 --> 01:24:53,855
Okay.

2372
01:24:54,925 --> 01:24:55,954
(Glancing over)

2373
01:24:55,955 --> 01:24:56,994
(He looks pretty natural.)

2374
01:24:56,995 --> 01:24:58,725
I can see that you have some experience.

2375
01:24:59,095 --> 01:25:01,265
Men usually have trouble doing this.

2376
01:25:01,525 --> 01:25:03,094
It's not about strength.

2377
01:25:03,095 --> 01:25:05,575
- It's about the wrist movement. - Right. You need the skills.

2378
01:25:08,275 --> 01:25:09,434
Gosh, that could've been bad.

2379
01:25:09,435 --> 01:25:11,381
(He seemed to have missed the blade with the radish.)

2380
01:25:11,405 --> 01:25:12,881
You can hear them slice the radishes, right?

2381
01:25:12,905 --> 01:25:13,974
(Slicing)

2382
01:25:13,975 --> 01:25:15,045
You can hear the slicing.

2383
01:25:15,745 --> 01:25:18,385
(The slicing sounds of the workers sound different.)

2384
01:25:18,515 --> 01:25:19,745
- Hello. - Hello.

2385
01:25:20,215 --> 01:25:22,585
You're going through so much early in the morning.

2386
01:25:23,085 --> 01:25:25,925
How long have you two worked here?

2387
01:25:26,055 --> 01:25:28,085
It's my 11th year here now.

2388
01:25:28,325 --> 01:25:29,525
You've been here for 11 years?

2389
01:25:31,025 --> 01:25:32,465
You've been here slicing radishes...

2390
01:25:32,925 --> 01:25:34,094
for 11 years?

2391
01:25:34,095 --> 01:25:36,495
(After slicing the radishes with a humble heart...)

2392
01:25:36,665 --> 01:25:37,964
(Master class, Lesson 2, Noodle making)

2393
01:25:37,965 --> 01:25:39,841
- This should be enough. - It shouldn't spill out. Right.

2394
01:25:39,865 --> 01:25:41,464
This will become the dough.

2395
01:25:41,465 --> 01:25:43,634
I'll add the water and salt.

2396
01:25:43,635 --> 01:25:44,635
Right.

2397
01:25:44,675 --> 01:25:46,575
It's my first time making handmade noodles.

2398
01:25:47,405 --> 01:25:49,275
(Adding a little bit of water)

2399
01:25:51,145 --> 01:25:52,145
(Adding a little bit of salt)

2400
01:25:52,146 --> 01:25:53,884
- I use my hands, right? - Not like that.

2401
01:25:53,885 --> 01:25:56,284
- Bring it to the middle gently. - Bring it to the middle?

2402
01:25:56,285 --> 01:25:57,715
Bring it to the middle gently.

2403
01:25:57,885 --> 01:25:59,555
It won't be easy.

2404
01:26:01,755 --> 01:26:04,355
(Buckwheat noodles of love)

2405
01:26:05,695 --> 01:26:06,695
(Hitting)

2406
01:26:06,696 --> 01:26:08,535
Stop drawing pictures like that. Move over.

2407
01:26:08,935 --> 01:26:11,804
Where will drawing pictures get you?

2408
01:26:11,805 --> 01:26:13,165
When will you make the dough?

2409
01:26:14,535 --> 01:26:15,934
You have to make the dough like this.

2410
01:26:15,935 --> 01:26:17,935
Who told you to draw pictures?

2411
01:26:18,175 --> 01:26:20,044
(It's my first time making dough.)

2412
01:26:20,045 --> 01:26:21,405
Bring it to the middle gently.

2413
01:26:21,775 --> 01:26:23,574
- Like this? - Okay.

2414
01:26:23,575 --> 01:26:24,845
Now we're talking.

2415
01:26:25,515 --> 01:26:27,044
Gently?

2416
01:26:27,045 --> 01:26:28,684
The dough made with 100 percent of buckwheat...

2417
01:26:28,685 --> 01:26:30,314
is different from other types of dough.

2418
01:26:30,315 --> 01:26:32,424
- It won't mix together. - Right.

2419
01:26:32,425 --> 01:26:33,825
That is why it's hard to work with.

2420
01:26:34,655 --> 01:26:36,394
The dough is getting together now.

2421
01:26:36,395 --> 01:26:38,895
Gosh! You sound macho now.

2422
01:26:44,365 --> 01:26:47,435
I've never heard someone say that to me in my whole life.

2423
01:26:47,635 --> 01:26:48,904
It's tough, isn't it?

2424
01:26:48,905 --> 01:26:50,475
This isn't an easy task.

2425
01:26:51,075 --> 01:26:53,115
It will be shaped like this to go into the machine.

2426
01:26:53,545 --> 01:26:54,875
How delicious would this be?

2427
01:26:55,845 --> 01:26:57,144
Here it goes.

2428
01:26:57,145 --> 01:26:58,215
(The dough will go in.)

2429
01:26:59,545 --> 01:27:00,684
- Pass it over. - This one too?

2430
01:27:00,685 --> 01:27:03,985
(The dough gets put into the modern machine...)

2431
01:27:06,855 --> 01:27:08,394
(and it turns into buckwheat noodles.)

2432
01:27:08,395 --> 01:27:09,955
The color of the water has changed too.

2433
01:27:10,155 --> 01:27:13,025
- Bitter buckwheat is a bit bluish. - Right.

2434
01:27:13,325 --> 01:27:14,665
It also feels yellow too.

2435
01:27:21,805 --> 01:27:24,805
(He quickly turns on the water for her.)

2436
01:27:26,505 --> 01:27:27,675
Try touching it.

2437
01:27:27,975 --> 01:27:29,414
- It has a nice texture, right? - Yes.

2438
01:27:29,415 --> 01:27:30,415
Right.

2439
01:27:30,416 --> 01:27:32,084
You can't knead it like that!

2440
01:27:32,085 --> 01:27:34,214
You have to touch it gently.

2441
01:27:34,215 --> 01:27:37,054
You can't knead the noodles as if it was the dough.

2442
01:27:37,055 --> 01:27:38,555
- Right. - You're driving me insane.

2443
01:27:38,955 --> 01:27:40,284
I've only learned how to knead the dough.

2444
01:27:40,285 --> 01:27:42,955
That's all you know. You only know how to knead.

2445
01:27:43,395 --> 01:27:45,324
May I try this, ma'am?

2446
01:27:45,325 --> 01:27:46,325
Okay.

2447
01:27:46,326 --> 01:27:48,564
I've really wanted to be the front-grabber.

2448
01:27:48,565 --> 01:27:49,725
- The front-grabber. - Right.

2449
01:27:49,835 --> 01:27:52,205
You can roll it with the help of the other hand, right?

2450
01:27:53,335 --> 01:27:54,665
Right. I'm learning a lot today.

2451
01:27:56,635 --> 01:27:58,645
Not everyone can become the front-grabber.

2452
01:27:59,005 --> 01:28:00,175
Roll it like that.

2453
01:28:02,315 --> 01:28:04,475
Right. You're a bit too tough.

2454
01:28:05,285 --> 01:28:07,645
Right. Roll it up like that and put it into the bowl.

2455
01:28:11,315 --> 01:28:12,785
You did well for your first attempt.

2456
01:28:13,055 --> 01:28:14,855
- This is hard. - You did well.

2457
01:28:16,095 --> 01:28:18,155
(Next up is the garnish.)

2458
01:28:19,195 --> 01:28:20,225
You're good.

2459
01:28:20,795 --> 01:28:22,865
Place the dried laver in the middle.

2460
01:28:23,035 --> 01:28:25,204
Just throw it on top. Okay. Do it freely.

2461
01:28:25,205 --> 01:28:27,205
(It's ready after the sesame seeds are sprinkled.)

2462
01:28:27,365 --> 01:28:28,734
(He starts serving for the staff members' meals!)

2463
01:28:28,735 --> 01:28:30,375
Here are the noodles.

2464
01:28:33,305 --> 01:28:37,245
You can dip the noodles in the soup.

2465
01:28:37,515 --> 01:28:39,945
Enjoy your meal.

01:28:43,715 --> 01:28:46,025
it's really good with a bit of vinegar.

2468
01:28:46,055 --> 01:28:47,055

01:29:13,145 --> 01:29:14,844
he can make noodles.

2480
01:29:14,845 --> 01:29:15,854
That's how good he is?
