1
00:00:15,128 --> 00:00:16,458
(Handsome Guys)

2
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:18,953
(Gunsan, North Jeolla Province, 7:30am)

3
00:00:19,527 --> 00:00:20,897
(At minus 8°C, one day when it's still fiercely cold)

4
00:00:20,898 --> 00:00:21,898
Tae Hyun.

5
00:00:23,268 --> 00:00:24,907
(The members came to work without fail.)

6
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:27,006
Tae Hyun came with a moustache.

7
00:00:27,007 --> 00:00:28,007
Goodness.

8
00:00:29,338 --> 00:00:31,048
Your skin has gotten much better.

9
00:00:31,577 --> 00:00:32,677
I changed my face.

10
00:00:32,678 --> 00:00:34,278
You look much better.

11
00:00:34,818 --> 00:00:36,118
What happened to Tae Hyun?

12
00:00:36,248 --> 00:00:38,687
To substitute Tae Hyun,

13
00:00:38,688 --> 00:00:41,457
I joined the show as a member today.

14
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,556
He joined us...

15
00:00:42,557 --> 00:00:44,456
not as a guest, but as a regular member.

16
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:45,956
Welcome.

17
00:00:45,957 --> 00:00:47,837
(Jang Hyuk playing Cha Tae Hyun only for today)

18
00:00:48,027 --> 00:00:49,056
It's good to see you.

19
00:00:49,057 --> 00:00:51,027
(A huge welcome)

20
00:00:51,497 --> 00:00:53,937
- Are you free tomorrow? - No, I'm not.

21
00:00:53,938 --> 00:00:55,218
- You aren't free? - You aren't?

22
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:56,368
- Really? - Yes.

23
00:00:56,369 --> 00:00:59,837
Jang Hyuk might get the penalty today.

24
00:00:59,838 --> 00:01:01,377
- Right. - If he does,

25
00:01:01,508 --> 00:01:03,078
Cha Tae Hyun will get...

26
00:01:03,478 --> 00:01:04,718
- the penalty instead. - Right.

27
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:07,617
- Really? - Wait a minute.

28
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:09,323
- He's smiling all of a sudden. - Is that so?

29
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:11,517
Tae Hyun would feel troubled. Jang Hyuk helped him, but...

30
00:01:11,518 --> 00:01:12,717
He wouldn't be aware of it.

31
00:01:12,718 --> 00:01:14,086
- Is he not aware of it? - Is he?

32
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:16,287
- He isn't aware of it. - Right.

33
00:01:16,888 --> 00:01:20,426
Hyuk, have you been acquainted with any of our members?

34
00:01:20,427 --> 00:01:22,927
I've only been acquainted with Dong Hyun.

35
00:01:23,127 --> 00:01:25,396
- And me? - It's my first time meeting you.

36
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:27,536
What? We've met before.

37
00:01:27,537 --> 00:01:29,768
Where did we meet?

38
00:01:30,138 --> 00:01:32,206
(Where did we meet?)

39
00:01:32,207 --> 00:01:33,267
Your face...

40
00:01:33,268 --> 00:01:35,536
Did you meet him in your dreams?

41
00:01:35,537 --> 00:01:36,607
I don't know about now,

42
00:01:36,608 --> 00:01:38,147
- but you used to live there. - Yes.

43
00:01:38,408 --> 00:01:39,807
My parents also live there,

44
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,717
so I bumped into you twice when I visited them.

45
00:01:41,718 --> 00:01:43,323
I said hello when we were recycling trash.

46
00:01:43,347 --> 00:01:44,487
Really?

47
00:01:44,587 --> 00:01:46,888
The gym in front of Cheongdam Station.

48
00:01:47,257 --> 00:01:48,616
I said hello to you four times.

49
00:01:48,617 --> 00:01:50,357
- This is embarrassing. - I said hello to you four times.

50
00:01:50,358 --> 00:01:51,358
(Unbelievable)

51
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,887
- Do you remember him now? - Yes.

52
00:01:52,888 --> 00:01:55,096
Now that he mentioned the gym...

53
00:01:55,097 --> 00:01:56,596
You don't remember me.

54
00:01:56,597 --> 00:01:57,997
Why am I always the only one who remembers?

55
00:01:57,998 --> 00:01:59,798
He probably thought that you were his fan.

56
00:01:59,968 --> 00:02:02,096
No one remembers meeting you.

57
00:02:02,097 --> 00:02:03,668
It's a social phenomenon.

58
00:02:04,168 --> 00:02:06,006
It's just a social phenomenon, so please understand.

59
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:07,236
(A social phenomenon?)

60
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:09,438
- But... - When you're past mid-40s,

61
00:02:09,778 --> 00:02:10,807
it can't be helped.

62
00:02:10,808 --> 00:02:12,547
- A social phenomenon? - I'm serious.

63
00:02:12,548 --> 00:02:14,877
Then do we have a separate guest?

64
00:02:15,078 --> 00:02:16,987
Yes, let's meet the guest.

65
00:02:18,418 --> 00:02:20,918
(Who's here?)

66
00:02:22,157 --> 00:02:23,358
- Park John. - Hello.

67
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:25,927
- Park John. - Hello.

68
00:02:26,957 --> 00:02:27,957
I'm so happy.

69
00:02:28,457 --> 00:02:29,858
- Hello. - Park John.

70
00:02:30,497 --> 00:02:31,628
Nice to meet you.

71
00:02:32,768 --> 00:02:37,568
(A sentimental ballad singer who makes our hearts flutter)

72
00:02:38,837 --> 00:02:40,706
(- His singing is way too good. - His low voice is so sexy.)

73
00:02:40,707 --> 00:02:43,647
(His sweet voice transformed into a heavy metal style.)

74
00:02:44,378 --> 00:02:46,578
(Now married, John to the Park)

75
00:02:48,518 --> 00:02:49,847
It's cold today.

76
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:51,517
Do you know each other well?

77
00:02:51,518 --> 00:02:53,556
We were on a show recently.

78
00:02:53,557 --> 00:02:54,586
We hung out.

79
00:02:54,587 --> 00:02:56,217
He wrote a song for me.

80
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,227
Sang Uk sent me a message.

81
00:03:00,228 --> 00:03:01,228
- Yes. - What?

82
00:03:01,229 --> 00:03:02,757
I'm his huge fan.

83
00:03:02,758 --> 00:03:04,627
- I really like him. - Did you send him a message?

84
00:03:04,628 --> 00:03:05,768
Yes, I really did.

85
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:07,537
(Dear John Park, I enjoy listening to your song "Places.")

86
00:03:07,538 --> 00:03:10,807
(In 2021, Sang Uk displayed his dohwasal.)

87
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:14,507
(They became close ever since.)

88
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:16,276
- How about Hyuk? - It's our first time...

89
00:03:16,277 --> 00:03:17,746
I feel honoured to meet you.

90
00:03:17,747 --> 00:03:20,347
Maybe I don't remember meeting you.

91
00:03:20,348 --> 00:03:21,418
No.

92
00:03:21,578 --> 00:03:22,977
- It's our first time meeting. - Is that right?

93
00:03:22,978 --> 00:03:24,387
Yes, it's our first time.

94
00:03:24,388 --> 00:03:25,717
He feels embarrassed.

95
00:03:25,918 --> 00:03:27,456
(Then I'm relieved.)

96
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,486
Sang Uk has gotten the penalty three times in a row.

97
00:03:30,487 --> 00:03:31,757
- Right? - Yes.

98
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:33,797
- Three times in a row. - I've been losing in a row.

99
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:35,157
I shouldn't be on his team.

100
00:03:36,358 --> 00:03:38,327
No, the two of you...

101
00:03:38,328 --> 00:03:40,567
I have a lot of hatred built up.

102
00:03:40,568 --> 00:03:42,467
I'm very spiteful.

103
00:03:42,698 --> 00:03:44,168
When you team up with Sang Uk...

104
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:46,906
Not all three members get the penalty.

105
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:48,037
He ends up getting it.

106
00:03:48,038 --> 00:03:49,307
(Sang Uk ends up getting it.)

107
00:03:49,538 --> 00:03:52,147
He's the perfect member to have like a scapegoat.

108
00:03:52,407 --> 00:03:53,716
Then I'll choose.

109
00:03:53,717 --> 00:03:55,377
(It's time to decide the teams.)

110
00:03:55,378 --> 00:03:56,418
I'll choose.

111
00:03:56,918 --> 00:04:00,617
(Who will be on Team Handsome with John Park?)

112
00:04:01,557 --> 00:04:03,456
(Sang Uk and...)

113
00:04:03,457 --> 00:04:04,657
It will be us three.

114
00:04:05,527 --> 00:04:07,056
- We'll be on the same team. - No.

115
00:04:07,057 --> 00:04:08,757
You didn't pick me because you thought you'd lose?

116
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:09,758
I'm doomed.

117
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:12,597
He probably picked me because he thinks he'll lose.

118
00:04:12,598 --> 00:04:13,836
With two of them I'm close to...

119
00:04:13,837 --> 00:04:15,137
I'm with someone who prefers to speak English...

120
00:04:15,138 --> 00:04:16,436
and someone who always gets the penalty.

121
00:04:16,437 --> 00:04:17,906
(Close friends)

122
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:19,436
- I like this. - I'm confident.

123
00:04:19,437 --> 00:04:20,977
I'm happy with my team.

124
00:04:20,978 --> 00:04:22,077
Of course you're happy.

125
00:04:22,078 --> 00:04:24,176
Whenever Yi Kyung and Sang Uk were on the same team,

126
00:04:24,177 --> 00:04:27,378
I often saw them decide who would get the penalty.

127
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:30,487
(He's right.)

128
00:04:30,488 --> 00:04:31,517
I've seen you...

129
00:04:31,518 --> 00:04:32,716
- compete so many times. - Right.

130
00:04:32,717 --> 00:04:34,656
We always did a quiz until the end.

131
00:04:34,657 --> 00:04:35,888
Right. That's why.

132
00:04:37,087 --> 00:04:38,327
All right.

133
00:04:38,328 --> 00:04:39,587
I like my team.

134
00:04:39,828 --> 00:04:41,727
Shall we pick the cards first?

135
00:04:42,258 --> 00:04:43,297
Yes.

136
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:45,367
(Then we'll pick them.)

137
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,037
Wait a minute.

138
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:49,336
- We don't know. It's random. - We don't know.

139
00:04:49,337 --> 00:04:50,567
I should take the last card.

140
00:04:50,568 --> 00:04:52,528
(Why is he running? The cards are random anyway.)

141
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:56,008
(Everyone checks his card.)

142
00:04:56,977 --> 00:04:58,178
Gosh, this is insane.

143
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:00,916
(Clapping)

144
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:02,546
(Happy)

145
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:03,647
Oh, my.

146
00:05:03,748 --> 00:05:05,317
- What do we do? - I'm sorry.

147
00:05:05,318 --> 00:05:07,287
(Worried)

148
00:05:07,587 --> 00:05:08,757
We're in trouble.

149
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:10,687
(They seem a little doomed.)

150
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:11,888
What's wrong with this one?

151
00:05:12,388 --> 00:05:13,726
We've never gotten such a combination before.

152
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:15,296
(Mixed reactions in the same situation)

153
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:16,396
We have both hope and despair.

154
00:05:16,397 --> 00:05:18,768
We got one reattempt card.

155
00:05:18,928 --> 00:05:20,096
Here's another one.

156
00:05:20,097 --> 00:05:21,666
We have two reattempt cards.

157
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:23,987
We also have a card to identify the other team's location.

158
00:05:24,037 --> 00:05:26,868
(Jealous)

159
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:29,807
- I have a 30-minute nap card. - Nap card?

160
00:05:29,808 --> 00:05:31,377
It's okay. We can sleep.

161
00:05:31,378 --> 00:05:34,046
I have a question. What's Pump It Up at the arcade card?

162
00:05:34,047 --> 00:05:36,216
- What is it? - It's Pump It Up.

163
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:37,287
Isn't that a music game?

164
00:05:37,717 --> 00:05:39,747
"Once you succeed Pump It Up during 30 minutes,"

165
00:05:39,748 --> 00:05:41,257
"you can move right away."

166
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:42,258
(Rhythm game card)

167
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:45,457
Isn't it hard to find an arcade with Pump It Up?

168
00:05:45,727 --> 00:05:48,127
These days, people play with their hands.

169
00:05:48,128 --> 00:05:49,627
(Being playful)

170
00:05:49,628 --> 00:05:51,867
I got the same one.

171
00:05:51,868 --> 00:05:53,368
It's wishing happy birthday card.

172
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:55,687
You have to use all the cards before the game is over.

173
00:05:55,797 --> 00:05:58,106
- Reattempt card? - I never had this combination.

174
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,537
- We're in trouble. - We'll definitely win.

175
00:06:01,037 --> 00:06:02,738
What is today's theme?

176
00:06:02,837 --> 00:06:04,447
Today's Handsome Heritage is...

177
00:06:04,448 --> 00:06:06,578
a bakery tour in North Jeolla Province.

178
00:06:06,748 --> 00:06:08,248
- A bakery tour? - A bakery tour?

179
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,747
Visiting famous or hidden bakeries is called...

180
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,416
a bakery tour.

181
00:06:14,417 --> 00:06:15,417
("To Gen MZ's Bakery Tour Sacred Place")

182
00:06:15,418 --> 00:06:17,178
(Gen MZ Makes Half of People on Bakery Tour)

183
00:06:17,388 --> 00:06:19,888
(That's why they came to visit North Jeolla Province.)

184
00:06:21,328 --> 00:06:24,368
(With local ingredients harvested from fertile fields)

185
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:30,368
(Where famous bread is made)

186
00:06:30,568 --> 00:06:34,106
By visiting bakeries in North Jeolla Province, we'll taste their bread...

187
00:06:34,107 --> 00:06:35,836
and ask questions.

188
00:06:35,837 --> 00:06:37,546
We will create...

189
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:40,406
our own Handsome Guys' bakery tour map.

190
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:41,476
(Gunsan, Jeonju, Gimje, Imsil, Buan, and Jeongeup)

191
00:06:41,477 --> 00:06:44,118
(Shall we go on a bakery tour on Handsome Guys?)

192
00:06:44,748 --> 00:06:45,786
(Full of anticipation)

193
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:47,117
- I like bread. - Do you?

194
00:06:47,118 --> 00:06:49,157
- I like bread. - He does too.

195
00:06:49,417 --> 00:06:52,086
- This is good. - Any questions related to bread.

196
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:54,127
- Do you know about bread? - I could be good at it.

197
00:06:54,328 --> 00:06:56,357
You have time until 7pm tonight.

198
00:06:56,628 --> 00:06:58,227
- Until 7pm. - The deadline is at 7pm.

199
00:06:58,828 --> 00:07:00,497
For the losing team,

200
00:07:00,498 --> 00:07:02,797
there will be an activity in North Jeolla Province.

201
00:07:03,368 --> 00:07:06,167
It's going to work at a bakery at dawn.

202
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:13,847
(Using muscles early in the morning)

203
00:07:14,748 --> 00:07:18,287
(A persistent fight with dough)

204
00:07:19,717 --> 00:07:22,388
(They must endure the heat from the oven.)

205
00:07:23,018 --> 00:07:26,188
(Tomorrow's penalty requires strength, technique, and patience.)

206
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:27,628
Right.

207
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:30,867
- You will make bread with care. - Okay.

208
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,397
Tell me about the penalty in detail.

209
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:35,037
I have to call Tae Hyun and explain to him.

210
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:37,237
Please give me the details.

211
00:07:37,238 --> 00:07:39,867
Hyuk is the only one exempted...

212
00:07:39,868 --> 00:07:40,976
from the penalty.

213
00:07:40,977 --> 00:07:43,507
In that case,

214
00:07:43,508 --> 00:07:45,407
don't answer the question after we lose.

215
00:07:46,207 --> 00:07:47,717
(Laughing)

216
00:07:48,078 --> 00:07:50,277
(You can count on me.)

217
00:07:50,587 --> 00:07:52,416
We have a new chance card.

218
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:53,547
- Which one? - What is it?

219
00:07:53,647 --> 00:07:55,456
I have a Cha Tae Hyun card.

220
00:07:55,457 --> 00:07:57,156
- It's called Cha Tae Hyun card. - Cha Tae Hyun card.

221
00:07:57,157 --> 00:07:59,057
You don't get the penalty even if you lose.

222
00:07:59,058 --> 00:08:00,427
Even if you lose, you never get the penalty?

223
00:08:00,428 --> 00:08:01,428
(When you lose, the penalty goes to Cha Tae Hyun.)

224
00:08:01,429 --> 00:08:03,197
I wouldn't exchange it with three reattempt cards.

225
00:08:03,198 --> 00:08:04,367
No way.

226
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:07,068
We have something better than the reattempt cards.

227
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,796
(The ultimate card appears.)

228
00:08:09,797 --> 00:08:11,937
Among these nine squares,

229
00:08:11,938 --> 00:08:13,406
just like last week,

230
00:08:13,407 --> 00:08:14,877
there's one Handsome Guys square.

231
00:08:14,878 --> 00:08:16,177
(He spots the familiar Handsome Guys square.)

232
00:08:16,178 --> 00:08:17,378
What do we do with this?

233
00:08:18,207 --> 00:08:20,346
With this square at stake,

234
00:08:20,347 --> 00:08:22,247
you'll do a quiz right away.

235
00:08:22,248 --> 00:08:24,818
- Of course. - We must win this one. It's huge.

236
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,217
It's really big.

237
00:08:26,647 --> 00:08:28,558
- We have to win this one. - Yes, it's huge.

238
00:08:28,857 --> 00:08:30,317
They have two reattempt cards.

239
00:08:30,318 --> 00:08:32,057
If they win this too,

240
00:08:32,058 --> 00:08:33,187
we might as well lose.

241
00:08:33,188 --> 00:08:34,527
We must win this to stay hopeful.

242
00:08:37,498 --> 00:08:42,238
(Which team will take the first victory?)

243
00:08:43,498 --> 00:08:46,208
- In December of 1948, - I wouldn't know.

244
00:08:46,437 --> 00:08:48,008
In The Independence Newspaper,

245
00:08:48,738 --> 00:08:51,478
an article was published under the title,

246
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:53,748
"MG Who Eat Doughnuts for Lunch."

247
00:08:53,807 --> 00:08:54,978
What's "MG?"

248
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,747
It talked about the increase of women...

249
00:08:57,748 --> 00:08:59,718
who eat expensive doughnuts for lunch.

250
00:08:59,917 --> 00:09:02,817
What does "MG" stand for?

251
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:04,327
Is it an acronym?

252
00:09:04,728 --> 00:09:07,797
(An article in the Independence in December 1948)

253
00:09:08,197 --> 00:09:12,728
(MG Who Eat Doughnuts for Lunch)

254
00:09:13,768 --> 00:09:16,896
(They read the article with their team.)

255
00:09:16,897 --> 00:09:18,008
Is this it?

256
00:09:18,238 --> 00:09:20,566
- No, this is poong... - Let's see.

257
00:09:20,567 --> 00:09:22,237
- MG? - MG?

258
00:09:22,238 --> 00:09:23,907
(MG?)

259
00:09:24,277 --> 00:09:26,047
- What's MG? - Yes, it's an acronym.

260
00:09:26,307 --> 00:09:28,348
What's an example for a recent acronym?

261
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:30,146
(An acronym?)

262
00:09:30,147 --> 00:09:31,417
What are some recent acronyms?

263
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:34,117
- Team Guys. - Will you go first?

264
00:09:34,118 --> 00:09:35,556
Once you say your answer,

265
00:09:35,557 --> 00:09:36,957
the turn goes to the other team.

266
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:38,326
- Really? - MG?

267
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,727
- MG. - MG.

268
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:41,057
(He withdraws for now.)

269
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:43,157
- Look. - Are the words Korean?

270
00:09:43,758 --> 00:09:46,526
"Women in the wealthy class."

271
00:09:46,527 --> 00:09:48,367
- This is missing. - In my opinion, it's in English.

272
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:49,667
Could it be mesdames?

273
00:09:50,868 --> 00:09:51,907
Team Handsome.

274
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:54,638
- Will you take your turn? - Yes.

275
00:09:55,338 --> 00:09:57,378
- Mesdames. - Mesdames?

276
00:09:58,108 --> 00:09:59,447
Mesdames is incorrect.

277
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:01,348
- Wait. - Shall we go?

278
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:03,416
Why did they say mesdames? Isn't it an acronym?

279
00:10:03,417 --> 00:10:04,587
So that's wrong.

280
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:05,588
I said it because it starts with M.

281
00:10:05,589 --> 00:10:06,987
What's wrong with you?

282
00:10:06,988 --> 00:10:09,717
How could it be mesdames when it's an acronym for MG?

283
00:10:09,718 --> 00:10:11,327
- Team Guys. - Team Guys?

284
00:10:11,927 --> 00:10:13,727
(All of a sudden?)

285
00:10:13,728 --> 00:10:15,327
- Team Guys. - Team Guys?

286
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:16,657
Modern girl.

287
00:10:17,768 --> 00:10:20,128
Modern girls.

288
00:10:20,228 --> 00:10:22,597
(Answer: Modern girls)

289
00:10:22,598 --> 00:10:23,638
Modern girl?

290
00:10:23,897 --> 00:10:25,767
(What will be the answer?)

291
00:10:25,768 --> 00:10:27,337
- Modern girl. - I bet it's right.

292
00:10:27,338 --> 00:10:28,437
Correct.

293
00:10:29,878 --> 00:10:31,047
Unbelievable.

294
00:10:31,647 --> 00:10:35,718
(Jang Hyuk answered the quiz in one go.)

295
00:10:36,277 --> 00:10:38,917
(Surprised)

296
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:43,287
(Amazing)

297
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:45,187
This is nothing.

298
00:10:45,327 --> 00:10:46,627
It's no big deal.

299
00:10:46,628 --> 00:10:47,696
(Pompous)

300
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:49,827
I've read the newspaper for 20 years.

301
00:10:50,157 --> 00:10:51,297
I read editorials.

302
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:53,228
(Impressed)

303
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:56,196
- We didn't get it. - No.

304
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,338
We didn't get the answer.

305
00:10:57,468 --> 00:10:58,566
This was when...

306
00:10:58,567 --> 00:11:01,638
the concept of modern girls was popular.

307
00:11:01,878 --> 00:11:04,607
An example is women drinking coffee.

308
00:11:04,608 --> 00:11:06,646
Your answer is so precise that I don't need to explain.

309
00:11:06,647 --> 00:11:08,123
(His answer and explanation are perfect.)

310
00:11:08,147 --> 00:11:10,017
I might not look like it,

311
00:11:10,018 --> 00:11:12,286
but I'm a brainiac.

312
00:11:12,287 --> 00:11:14,858
(I'm a brainiac.)

313
00:11:15,518 --> 00:11:18,187
(Our eldest member is amazing.)

314
00:11:18,327 --> 00:11:20,757
- Handsome Guys. - Guys.

315
00:11:20,758 --> 00:11:26,427
(Handsome Guys)

316
00:11:27,998 --> 00:11:29,767
Sang Uk, you have to win this time.

317
00:11:29,768 --> 00:11:32,537
We have two reattempt cards. We have a good chance of winning.

318
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:34,277
They have to eat anyway,

319
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:36,378
so we can pick any location.

320
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:37,748
How about this?

321
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:39,747
Like Tae Hyun's strategy,

322
00:11:39,748 --> 00:11:41,348
shall we go to all the places nearby?

323
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:43,848
One by one?

324
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:46,186
Then shall we go to Gunsan?

325
00:11:46,187 --> 00:11:47,557
(To Gunsan?)

326
00:11:47,657 --> 00:11:49,587
Yes, we can go to Gunsan first.

327
00:11:49,588 --> 00:11:51,488
Then we can go to either Iksan or Gimje.

328
00:11:52,088 --> 00:11:54,457
- What do you think, Park? - I like it.

329
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,297
- What's your idea? - I'll follow your lead.

330
00:11:57,598 --> 00:11:59,396
- Here we go. - Let's go.

331
00:11:59,397 --> 00:12:01,737
(Team Handsome heads to a bakery in Gunsan.)

332
00:12:01,738 --> 00:12:03,868
(Team Guys)

333
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:07,608
(Their first restaurant near Gunsan Station)

334
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:09,608
Let's go. We must eat quickly.

335
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:11,047
We don't have much time.

336
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:13,008
- Hello. - Hello.

337
00:12:15,177 --> 00:12:18,547
(What food do they have to eat after their first win?)

338
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:21,258
(Opening segment: Braised monkfish)

339
00:12:21,988 --> 00:12:25,588
(A mix of chewy texture and spicy marinade)

340
00:12:26,927 --> 00:12:30,527
(A delicacy to try even early in the morning)

341
00:12:30,598 --> 00:12:32,026
Is the medium size enough for three?

342
00:12:32,027 --> 00:12:33,498
- Yes. - We'll order that.

343
00:12:34,297 --> 00:12:37,707
(To eat quickly and leave, they order right away.)

344
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,406
To block our row,

345
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:41,007
they would either go to Ilksan,

346
00:12:41,008 --> 00:12:42,177
which is nearby.

347
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,207
Or they might go after Imsil.

348
00:12:44,208 --> 00:12:45,576
(Team Handsome probably went to Imsil.)

349
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:46,677
Once you win Imsil,

350
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:48,947
you get so many advantages.

351
00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:50,917
That's true.

352
00:12:51,018 --> 00:12:52,588
I think...

353
00:12:54,917 --> 00:12:57,588
the other team will try to complete a bingo.

354
00:12:58,157 --> 00:12:59,657
They have two reattempt cards.

355
00:12:59,927 --> 00:13:02,327
Then what should we do based on that?

356
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,097
We can go to as many places as possible.

357
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:07,296
Even if we fail, we can go to another nearby city.

358
00:13:07,297 --> 00:13:09,537
That's what our strategy should be.

359
00:13:09,838 --> 00:13:12,406
I don't know if I'm right.

360
00:13:12,407 --> 00:13:15,076
I think...

361
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:16,838
we should be a little daring.

362
00:13:17,238 --> 00:13:19,776
- Let's be honest. - Okay.

363
00:13:19,777 --> 00:13:21,947
None of us will get the penalty.

364
00:13:23,277 --> 00:13:24,487
(Smiling big)

365
00:13:24,488 --> 00:13:27,446
My friend will handle the penalty, so don't worry about that.

366
00:13:27,447 --> 00:13:28,957
(Cha Tae Hyun will get the penalty anyway.)

367
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,357
- Let's be drastic. - Can I really trust you?

368
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:33,387
- Think of it as travelling. - Yes.

369
00:13:33,388 --> 00:13:35,457
Think of it as travelling in Gunsan.

370
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:36,758
I'll do my best.

371
00:13:37,768 --> 00:13:39,228
(Glancing)

372
00:13:40,527 --> 00:13:43,337
(The mixed braised monkfish arrives.)

373
00:13:43,338 --> 00:13:45,036
This is medium size, and it's this big?

374
00:13:45,037 --> 00:13:47,067
(Surprised)

375
00:13:47,268 --> 00:13:50,477
(The amount is generous.)

376
00:13:50,478 --> 00:13:51,577
Gosh.

377
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,748
(Exclaiming)

378
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,378
I've never seen a cuttlefish before.

379
00:13:55,978 --> 00:13:57,786
(Cutting into bite sizes)

380
00:13:57,787 --> 00:13:58,988
Look at the cuttlefish.

381
00:14:00,088 --> 00:14:03,388
It's full of protein.

382
00:14:03,417 --> 00:14:04,686
Enjoy your food.

383
00:14:04,687 --> 00:14:05,987
- You too. - Enjoy.

384
00:14:05,988 --> 00:14:07,057
(It's time to eat.)

385
00:14:08,258 --> 00:14:11,567
(The eldest one takes a bite of red monkfish first.)

386
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:15,468
(The second eldest takes a big bite.)

387
00:14:17,138 --> 00:14:18,937
It's a tasty restaurant. It's hot.

388
00:14:19,868 --> 00:14:21,138
It's so delicious.

389
00:14:22,907 --> 00:14:24,977
(One bite)

390
00:14:24,978 --> 00:14:26,176
(Two bites)

391
00:14:26,177 --> 00:14:28,878
(Three bites)

392
00:14:30,218 --> 00:14:33,118
(3 bites of monkfish with 1 spoon of rice)

393
00:14:33,848 --> 00:14:36,717
(While Dong Hyun is eating a lot of protein)

394
00:14:36,718 --> 00:14:38,156
This is so delicious.

395
00:14:38,157 --> 00:14:40,258
- Yes. - I was actually full.

396
00:14:41,598 --> 00:14:45,998
(The youngest falls in love with the monkfish charms.)

397
00:14:48,868 --> 00:14:51,306
Instead of leaving, I want to take my time and eat.

398
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:52,667
(I want to take my time and eat.)

399
00:14:53,037 --> 00:14:54,407
I don't know much,

400
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:56,536
but fretting about winning doesn't make you win.

401
00:14:56,537 --> 00:14:57,807
Right, it's always the case.

402
00:14:57,978 --> 00:15:01,517
This is something I've watched over 100 times.

403
00:15:01,518 --> 00:15:02,947
I watched it over 100 times.

404
00:15:03,077 --> 00:15:04,218
"Rocky."

405
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:06,587
- I saw all the series. - "Rocky?"

406
00:15:06,588 --> 00:15:08,987
For "Rocky,"

407
00:15:08,988 --> 00:15:12,357
Sylvester Stallone wrote the original script.

408
00:15:12,358 --> 00:15:14,257
He wanted to direct it but couldn't.

409
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:15,926
After retiring,

410
00:15:15,927 --> 00:15:18,227
he still wanted to compete.

411
00:15:18,228 --> 00:15:22,166
"Rocky" isn't just about sportsmanship.

412
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:23,997
What's important isn't winning.

413
00:15:23,998 --> 00:15:26,267
Enduring the match...

414
00:15:26,268 --> 00:15:28,436
In the process of preparing for a match,

415
00:15:28,437 --> 00:15:30,807
there's a story about his life.

416
00:15:30,878 --> 00:15:32,977
On top of that, he's a gangster.

417
00:15:32,978 --> 00:15:34,547
Shall we have some soju and talk?

418
00:15:34,718 --> 00:15:36,478
The vibe is perfect for some soju.

419
00:15:37,077 --> 00:15:38,518
Usually, when we eat,

420
00:15:38,917 --> 00:15:41,057
Tae Hyun tells us to hurry up.

421
00:15:41,388 --> 00:15:42,517
"We have no time to eat."

422
00:15:42,518 --> 00:15:44,157
He told us to eat fast.

423
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:47,127
It's nice that you're leading the team today.

424
00:15:47,128 --> 00:15:48,797
- We get to talk about life. - I love it.

425
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:51,527
Take your time and eat.

426
00:15:52,197 --> 00:15:53,826
(Their meal continues in a relaxed atmosphere.)

427
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:54,937
Gosh.

428
00:15:56,297 --> 00:15:58,307
Do you know the address?

429
00:15:58,407 --> 00:15:59,667
Here it is.

430
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,906
- Suseong-dong, Gunsan. - Suseong-dong.

431
00:16:01,907 --> 00:16:03,177
Suseong-dong.

432
00:16:03,378 --> 00:16:05,007
It's 2km away? Where is it?

433
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:06,046
In Gunsan.

434
00:16:06,047 --> 00:16:07,377
- Let me see. - It's only 2km away?

435
00:16:07,378 --> 00:16:08,416
It's around the corner.

436
00:16:08,417 --> 00:16:10,618
- We're in Gunsan right now. - I know.

437
00:16:10,718 --> 00:16:12,487
Did they not go there?

438
00:16:12,488 --> 00:16:14,358
They must have gone there.

439
00:16:14,718 --> 00:16:16,717
- There's no reason not to go there. - Right.

440
00:16:16,718 --> 00:16:17,887
(It only takes 10 minutes. They set off in a hurry.)

441
00:16:17,888 --> 00:16:19,787
It's closer than what you see on the map.

442
00:16:20,088 --> 00:16:22,758
If we find them at the bakery in Gunsan,

443
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:24,098
let's just get bread.

444
00:16:24,397 --> 00:16:26,267
- Why don't we get bread? - That's possible.

445
00:16:26,268 --> 00:16:27,426
We can tease them too.

446
00:16:27,427 --> 00:16:29,137
- That's perfect. - Either way,

447
00:16:29,138 --> 00:16:30,267
we have to buy a cake.

448
00:16:30,268 --> 00:16:32,436
If they're there, let's buy bread while teasing them.

449
00:16:32,437 --> 00:16:33,707
(Lightheartedly)

450
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,137
We'll say that we came for some bread.

451
00:16:35,138 --> 00:16:37,907
(They arrive at the destination.)

452
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:40,348
We're here.

453
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:44,077
(Will Team Handsome be in Gunsan?)

454
00:16:44,222 --> 00:16:47,063
(10m until the destination)

455
00:16:47,392 --> 00:16:48,891
(Will they get the quiz...)

456
00:16:48,892 --> 00:16:51,502
(or will they get to buy bread?)

457
00:16:52,502 --> 00:16:54,342
- I don't think they came here. - They didn't.

458
00:16:54,432 --> 00:16:55,772
(Destination)

459
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:58,102
(The bakery looks empty.)

460
00:16:58,103 --> 00:16:59,272
They didn't come here.

461
00:16:59,273 --> 00:17:00,803
- They didn't. - Where did they go?

462
00:17:00,843 --> 00:17:03,043
Please go to the parking lot on the left.

463
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:05,283
They could have gone to Iksan.

464
00:17:05,813 --> 00:17:07,613
They're going after a bingo.

465
00:17:08,182 --> 00:17:10,882
- Go ahead and try. - This is for the better.

466
00:17:10,883 --> 00:17:12,252
We'll come to block you.

467
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:13,553
Getting a bingo isn't easy.

468
00:17:14,383 --> 00:17:15,891
We'll just block them.

469
00:17:15,892 --> 00:17:17,092
We can put them to sleep.

470
00:17:17,093 --> 00:17:18,523
We can put them to sleep.

471
00:17:18,922 --> 00:17:20,292
(Team Handsome)

472
00:17:20,293 --> 00:17:22,862
Park's idea is amazing.

473
00:17:22,863 --> 00:17:24,701
Going to Iksan first is...

474
00:17:24,702 --> 00:17:25,863
a good idea.

475
00:17:26,863 --> 00:17:29,232
(As Dong Hyun expected, they're heading to Iksan.)

476
00:17:29,603 --> 00:17:31,701
(A moment ago)

477
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:34,002
(He was looking at the board carefully.)

478
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:36,242
Since they're over here,

479
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:37,812
their options are...

480
00:17:37,813 --> 00:17:39,212
these two.

481
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:41,382
This place is far away.

482
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:42,559
(Based on possible bingos for Team Guys)

483
00:17:42,583 --> 00:17:44,623
We'd better win Iksan first.

484
00:17:46,283 --> 00:17:47,522
(Iksan: Corn Toast Bread)

485
00:17:47,523 --> 00:17:49,122
Iksan is very important.

486
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:50,622
(Blocking the other team's bingo)

487
00:17:50,623 --> 00:17:53,222
They started off by winning one square,

488
00:17:54,293 --> 00:17:56,133
but we must win today's race no matter what.

489
00:17:56,263 --> 00:17:57,462
We must win.

490
00:17:58,303 --> 00:17:59,862
Since we have two reattempt cards,

491
00:17:59,863 --> 00:18:01,302
we'll win two.

492
00:18:01,303 --> 00:18:03,671
It's impossible not to win with these cards.

493
00:18:03,672 --> 00:18:04,843
During the race...

494
00:18:05,702 --> 00:18:07,043
You know what?

495
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:09,412
When you fail once,

496
00:18:09,513 --> 00:18:11,513
you get a mental breakdown.

497
00:18:12,113 --> 00:18:15,013
I'm serious. We have to move to the next location.

498
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:16,783
It feels like...

499
00:18:16,982 --> 00:18:18,853
losing all your money in your bank account.

500
00:18:18,982 --> 00:18:20,283
Seriously.

501
00:18:20,523 --> 00:18:22,691
- It's that bad. - Like it's futile?

502
00:18:22,692 --> 00:18:24,523
You feel like you lost everything.

503
00:18:25,492 --> 00:18:26,562
(For now, he finds it funny.)

504
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,822
You might be laughing now,

505
00:18:27,823 --> 00:18:30,263
but I'll see your eyes widen very soon.

(To win their first square)

507
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:35,201
We arrived at our first spot, Iksan.

508
00:18:35,202 --> 00:18:36,773
- Good. - Okay.

(Iksan: Corn Toast Bread)

511
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:41,513
What was it?

512
00:18:41,712 --> 00:18:44,613
- Corn toast bread. - Corn toast bread.

513
00:18:44,682 --> 00:18:46,681
- Hello. - Hello.

Gosh, the smell.

516
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,211
- Hello. - It smells sweet.

517
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:52,422
I love the smell.

518
00:18:52,652 --> 00:18:54,151
The smell of a bakery.

519
00:18:54,152 --> 00:18:55,512
(Inside the trendy-looking bakery)

520
00:18:57,192 --> 00:18:59,421
(There's toast bread you can't buy unless you come in the morning.)

521
00:18:59,422 --> 00:19:00,822
- Isn't that corn toast bread? - Where?

522
00:19:00,823 --> 00:19:02,033
At the very end.

523
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:04,293
- Toast bread? - It must be over there.

(Exclaiming)

525
00:19:07,033 --> 00:19:08,232
Corn toast bread.

526
00:19:09,502 --> 00:19:11,102
The colour looks bright.

527
00:19:11,103 --> 00:19:13,802
(The toast bread doesn't look special on the outside.)

528
00:19:13,803 --> 00:19:15,789
There's also corn toast bread with glutinous rice.

529
00:19:15,813 --> 00:19:17,372
- Shall we try some? - Shall we?

530
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:18,843
That sounds good.

(He also takes toast bread with glutinous rice.)

532
00:19:22,353 --> 00:19:25,283
You have to eat bread all day long.

533
00:19:25,383 --> 00:19:26,823
It won't be all day long...

534
00:19:27,023 --> 00:19:29,293
because...

535
00:19:29,892 --> 00:19:31,891
Once we eat at three places, it will be over.

536
00:19:31,892 --> 00:19:33,363
- Okay. - And we'll win the bingo?

537
00:19:33,392 --> 00:19:35,092
- Great. - That's a good attitude.

538
00:19:35,093 --> 00:19:37,691
(Won't we get a bingo after eating bread three times?)

539
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:39,532

00:19:44,232 --> 00:19:46,302
The smell is amazing.

544
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,212
It smells really good.

545
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:51,442
Is there anything that we must try?

546
00:19:52,383 --> 00:19:54,981
I recommend you to try three types of toast bread.

547
00:19:54,982 --> 00:19:56,482
- Three types? - All of them?

548
00:19:57,152 --> 00:19:58,421
- And... - Is there more?

549
00:19:58,422 --> 00:20:00,251
I recommend anything made with corn.

550
00:20:00,252 --> 00:20:02,452
It's corn chestnut toast bread.

551
00:20:03,123 --> 00:20:05,022
There's corn chestnut toast bread.

552
00:20:05,023 --> 00:20:07,191
It must be freshly made. It's warm.

553
00:20:07,192 --> 00:20:08,792
Hey, this is warm.

554
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:10,162
Then let's eat it.

555
00:20:11,563 --> 00:20:12,961
It looks delicious.

556
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,272
(It's time to taste.)

557
00:20:15,273 --> 00:20:17,833
Here are the top three at a bakery famous for corn toast bread.

558
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,573
Which one shall we start with?

559
00:20:19,902 --> 00:20:22,372
- How about the basic one? - It looks attractive.

560
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:23,711
The basic one?

561
00:20:23,712 --> 00:20:26,142
She gave me the pair of scissors.

562
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:30,951
(This one is for Park.)

563
00:20:30,952 --> 00:20:32,151
(Thank you.)

564
00:20:32,152 --> 00:20:33,353
It's to die for.

565
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,852
(This one is for me.)

566
00:20:36,853 --> 00:20:38,191
There you go.

567
00:20:38,192 --> 00:20:40,691
(The big one is for Sang Uk.)

568
00:20:40,692 --> 00:20:41,991
Isn't that a brick?

569
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:43,192
Isn't it for you?

570
00:20:45,002 --> 00:20:46,162
As expected,

571
00:20:46,432 --> 00:20:48,931
Sang Uk's piece is much thicker.

572
00:20:48,932 --> 00:20:51,401
- Of course. He should eat a lot. - Thank you.

573
00:20:51,402 --> 00:20:52,941
What's with the texture?

574
00:20:52,942 --> 00:20:55,072
(Surprised the 1st time by the bread's texture)

575
00:20:55,073 --> 00:20:56,242
It's like sponge.

576
00:20:58,482 --> 00:21:01,782
(The yellow inside stretches out as it tears.)

577
00:21:01,783 --> 00:21:02,982
Shall I try the classic type?

578
00:21:03,182 --> 00:21:07,823
(Yi Kyung takes the first bite.)

579
00:21:07,982 --> 00:21:09,553
The inside is so soft.

580
00:21:09,623 --> 00:21:10,792
You'll be very surprised.

581
00:21:10,793 --> 00:21:12,553
(Surprised the 2nd time by the soft texture)

582
00:21:12,892 --> 00:21:15,833
(Foodie Sang Uk takes a bite like Yi Kyung.)

583
00:21:16,732 --> 00:21:19,133
(His forehead reacts right away and expresses the truth.)

584
00:21:19,563 --> 00:21:21,872
(John Park also takes a bite.)

585
00:21:21,873 --> 00:21:23,032
It's good.

586
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:26,872
(The taste makes you move up and down.)

587
00:21:26,873 --> 00:21:28,672
- The taste is subtle... - Yes.

588
00:21:28,942 --> 00:21:30,441
Instead of being strong.

589
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:32,313
Usually, corn toast bread is...

590
00:21:32,613 --> 00:21:36,682
- toast bread with corn kernels. - Is that so?

591
00:21:36,752 --> 00:21:39,883
I think that there's corn inside the dough.

592
00:21:40,523 --> 00:21:43,092
The bread has a strong flavour of corn.

593
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,898
(There's a strong flavour of corn in the bread)

594
00:21:44,922 --> 00:21:47,363
The glutinous rice bread is incredible. Look inside.

595
00:21:48,563 --> 00:21:50,662
- What's that? - Isn't it sweet potato?

596
00:21:51,263 --> 00:21:52,902
Isn't it glutinous rice inside?

597
00:21:53,402 --> 00:21:55,132
Is it like corn jam?

598
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:56,908
(The second is corn toast bread with glutinous rice.)

599
00:21:56,932 --> 00:21:59,543
(What are the transparent chunks?)

600
00:22:00,242 --> 00:22:01,773
- Is it jam? - No.

601
00:22:01,873 --> 00:22:04,412
It's glutinous rice made into rice cakes. The texture is...

602
00:22:04,472 --> 00:22:07,441
It's so chewy that it sticks inside the mouth.

603
00:22:07,442 --> 00:22:08,842
(The chewy texture is interesting.)

604
00:22:09,083 --> 00:22:12,722
(They're so curious that they can't resist it.)

605
00:22:12,823 --> 00:22:14,151
You know what I mean?

606
00:22:14,152 --> 00:22:16,692
(The glutinous rice toast bread makes him nod automatically.)

607
00:22:16,722 --> 00:22:19,823
It's like glutinous rice doughnut with bread inside.

608
00:22:19,863 --> 00:22:21,692
It's neither bread nor rice.

609
00:22:22,492 --> 00:22:24,431
Right. It's rice cake-like bread.

610
00:22:24,432 --> 00:22:25,962
You chew on glutinous rice.

611
00:22:27,103 --> 00:22:29,402
- Do you like chestnuts? - I do.

612
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,142
It has about five chestnuts.

613
00:22:33,442 --> 00:22:36,543
(Lastly, it's corn chestnut toast bread.)

614
00:22:37,742 --> 00:22:42,012
(Full of sweet and crumbly chestnuts)

615
00:22:42,013 --> 00:22:44,813
(They all take a bite at the same time.)

616
00:22:47,652 --> 00:22:48,793
It's very...

617
00:22:49,293 --> 00:22:50,722
sweet in a nice way.

618
00:22:50,752 --> 00:22:52,322
It's chestnut itself.

619
00:22:52,323 --> 00:22:53,763
(It's chestnut itself.)

620
00:22:54,422 --> 00:22:55,692
It must be the bakery owner.

621
00:22:55,992 --> 00:22:57,431
- Are you the bakery owner? - Yes.

622
00:22:57,432 --> 00:22:58,432
- I see. - Hello.

623
00:22:58,433 --> 00:22:59,961
- Hello. - Hello.

624
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,702
- The bread is delicious. - Hello.

625
00:23:02,303 --> 00:23:04,402
You're much younger than I thought.

626
00:23:04,432 --> 00:23:06,472
I'm the baker's eldest son.

627
00:23:06,543 --> 00:23:07,872
Are you the successor?

628
00:23:07,873 --> 00:23:10,872
I'm working hard to learn in order to succeed the bakery.

629
00:23:10,873 --> 00:23:12,612
(He's still learning to succeed the bakery.)

630
00:23:12,613 --> 00:23:14,981
- Is Iksan not famous for corn? - Right.

631
00:23:14,982 --> 00:23:17,312
Then how did you start making bread with corn?

632
00:23:17,313 --> 00:23:19,052
My father did a lot of research.

633
00:23:19,053 --> 00:23:20,981
He likes the savoury taste.

634
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:24,751
Toast bread that's light and savoury is popular.

635
00:23:24,752 --> 00:23:27,592
That's why we use corn as the main base.

636
00:23:27,593 --> 00:23:33,132
We add corn to the dough and mix them together.

637
00:23:33,133 --> 00:23:34,133
I see.

638
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:36,232
They actually add corn.

639
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,671
It's a starter.

640
00:23:38,672 --> 00:23:40,273
- We call it mother dough. - Right.

641
00:23:41,043 --> 00:23:43,141
Mother dough isn't normally used for toast bread, is it?

642
00:23:43,142 --> 00:23:44,812
Right, it's hardly used.

643
00:23:44,813 --> 00:23:45,813
(Impressed)

644
00:23:46,113 --> 00:23:48,383
It's to make the dough chewy.

645
00:23:48,912 --> 00:23:51,052
Based on my father's secret,

646
00:23:51,053 --> 00:23:53,352
- Is it his secret recipe? - we created...

647
00:23:53,353 --> 00:23:55,422
three more bread recipes.

648
00:23:55,492 --> 00:23:57,652
Regular toast bread is soft...

649
00:23:57,992 --> 00:23:59,792
and easy to tear.

650
00:23:59,793 --> 00:24:01,792
But this one is sticky.

651
00:24:01,793 --> 00:24:03,132
I agree.

652
00:24:03,133 --> 00:24:05,231
- It's because of the mother dough. - Exactly.

653
00:24:05,232 --> 00:24:07,133
That's the biggest difference.

654
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,773
- Thank you. - Thank you.

655
00:24:11,202 --> 00:24:14,201
He said that the baker did a lot of research,

656
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,911
- and I can tell. - Totally.

657
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,612
I never had toast bread like this.

658
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:19,082
- It's made with love. - Right.

659
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,482
You know a lot about bread.

660
00:24:20,912 --> 00:24:22,251
We have a good chance today.

661
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:23,912
We just need to visit two more places.

662
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:26,152
You sounded very smart.

663
00:24:26,652 --> 00:24:28,891
(Iksan: Corn Toast Bread)

664
00:24:28,892 --> 00:24:30,823
(Time for Quiz)

665
00:24:31,093 --> 00:24:32,822
Since Park is with us, I'm not worried.

666
00:24:32,823 --> 00:24:34,722
- It seemed like he knew a lot. - Right.

667
00:24:34,863 --> 00:24:36,033
- Here's the quiz. - Okay.

668
00:24:36,793 --> 00:24:38,833
- Let's get it without hints. - Of course.

669
00:24:39,202 --> 00:24:41,563
The number of kernels on a cob is...

670
00:24:43,373 --> 00:24:45,642
equivalent of this.

671
00:24:47,642 --> 00:24:48,712
What is it?

672
00:24:49,513 --> 00:24:50,793
Could it be the number of teeth?

673
00:24:51,543 --> 00:24:53,082
They're not the same at all.

674
00:24:53,083 --> 00:24:54,842
- You mean, puffed corn snack? - No matter what...

675
00:24:54,843 --> 00:24:55,882
Isn't it right?

676
00:24:55,883 --> 00:24:57,951
When you measure one row...

677
00:24:57,952 --> 00:24:59,251
(No one has 100 teeth.)

678
00:24:59,252 --> 00:25:01,451
- Is it similar or the same? - It's exactly the same.

679
00:25:01,452 --> 00:25:02,592
He said that it's the same,

680
00:25:02,593 --> 00:25:04,122
- not just similar. - That's what he said.

681
00:25:04,123 --> 00:25:05,823
If it's the same,

682
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,532
- they must be the same family. - Definitely.

683
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:10,363
Something in the corn family with grains.

684
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,802
What's similar to corn?

685
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:13,961
Is corn...

686
00:25:13,962 --> 00:25:15,533
a type of grain?

687
00:25:15,672 --> 00:25:16,702
Grain.

688
00:25:17,273 --> 00:25:18,772
(Grain?)

689
00:25:18,773 --> 00:25:19,803
Then barley.

690
00:25:20,343 --> 00:25:22,171
Barley doesn't have many kernels.

691
00:25:22,172 --> 00:25:23,372
(The number of kernels)

692
00:25:23,373 --> 00:25:25,782
I can only think of barley when it comes to grains.

693
00:25:25,783 --> 00:25:27,612
- There's definitely... - Only barley has kernels...

694
00:25:27,613 --> 00:25:28,712
that splatter.

695
00:25:29,013 --> 00:25:30,782
When he gets stuck on something, that's all he talks about.

696
00:25:30,783 --> 00:25:31,822
(Laughing)

697
00:25:31,823 --> 00:25:33,353
When he gets stuck on something...

698
00:25:33,682 --> 00:25:35,192
Barley.

699
00:25:35,623 --> 00:25:36,652
Wait.

700
00:25:38,123 --> 00:25:39,222
Did you think of something?

701
00:25:40,422 --> 00:25:41,563
Isn't it popcorn?

702
00:25:42,093 --> 00:25:43,632
- Popcorn? - In one bag of popcorn,

703
00:25:43,633 --> 00:25:45,302
there's an ear of corn.

704
00:25:45,303 --> 00:25:47,002
That sounds plausible.

705
00:25:47,103 --> 00:25:48,402
Won't it be possible?

706
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,273
Doesn't it depend on the seller?

707
00:25:50,472 --> 00:25:52,072
He said that they're exactly the same.

708
00:25:52,073 --> 00:25:53,373
- The same. - Think about it.

709
00:25:53,573 --> 00:25:58,141
Each ear of corn has a different number of kernels.

710
00:25:58,142 --> 00:25:59,442
They're all different.

711
00:25:59,712 --> 00:26:01,082
- The number can't be consistent. - You're right.

712
00:26:01,083 --> 00:26:02,982
- Darn it. - Every ear of corn has...

713
00:26:03,152 --> 00:26:05,721
a different number of kernels.

714
00:26:05,722 --> 00:26:08,652
How can corn have the same number of kernels as another grain?

715
00:26:08,752 --> 00:26:11,523
It must be something that's made with corn.

716
00:26:12,023 --> 00:26:13,062
- You're a genius. - John.

717
00:26:13,063 --> 00:26:14,822
The answer must be a bag of popcorn.

718
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:15,892
Seriously.

719
00:26:16,162 --> 00:26:17,731
It's a little vague.

720
00:26:17,732 --> 00:26:19,731
As Sang Uk said,

721
00:26:19,732 --> 00:26:22,232
one bag of popcorn depends...

722
00:26:22,432 --> 00:26:24,501
- You meant the microwavable kind. - on the brand.

723
00:26:24,502 --> 00:26:26,102
Yes, that's what I meant.

724
00:26:26,103 --> 00:26:27,141
- It's unclear. - It's unclear.

725
00:26:27,142 --> 00:26:28,742
- The answer is unclear. - It's unclear.

726
00:26:29,373 --> 00:26:30,442
How about this?

727
00:26:30,573 --> 00:26:32,142
During the corn's growing process,

728
00:26:32,412 --> 00:26:34,181
there could be seeds.

729
00:26:34,182 --> 00:26:35,352
Here's what I thought.

730
00:26:35,353 --> 00:26:37,411
Corn has roots.

731
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:38,623
On the roots,

732
00:26:40,023 --> 00:26:42,053
- is it called hair? - Fine hair?

733
00:26:43,452 --> 00:26:45,292
- Corn silk? - There are a lot...

734
00:26:45,293 --> 00:26:47,491
- Corn silk? - Yes, corn silk.

735
00:26:47,492 --> 00:26:48,691
Not the kernels...

736
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:50,991
So it has the same number as the kernels?

737
00:26:50,992 --> 00:26:52,763
Corn silk makes sense.

738
00:26:53,303 --> 00:26:54,362
Corn silk?

739
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:57,501
Maybe a kernel grows from each strand of corn silk.

740
00:26:57,502 --> 00:26:59,662
Don't they get separated when corn silk is pulled off?

741
00:26:59,843 --> 00:27:01,073
What are you talking about?

742
00:27:02,343 --> 00:27:04,411
Like the root of the hair?

743
00:27:04,412 --> 00:27:05,412
Exactly.

744
00:27:05,682 --> 00:27:08,212
We don't know because corn silk is removed.

745
00:27:08,783 --> 00:27:10,452
Corn has a lot of corn silk.

746
00:27:10,813 --> 00:27:12,322
- Corn silk. - Corn silk.

747
00:27:12,323 --> 00:27:13,352
- Corn silk. - Corn silk?

748
00:27:13,353 --> 00:27:14,921
- It's the only answer. - Okay.

749
00:27:14,922 --> 00:27:16,023
Go, John Park.

750
00:27:16,623 --> 00:27:19,592
The answer is corn silk.

751
00:27:19,593 --> 00:27:26,602
(Answer: Corn silk)

752
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,661
Correct.

753
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:29,272
(Answer: Corn silk)

754
00:27:29,273 --> 00:27:30,833
- That's crazy. - Yes, man.

755
00:27:31,133 --> 00:27:33,142
We got it. This is insane.

756
00:27:33,303 --> 00:27:35,843
This is insane.

757
00:27:37,212 --> 00:27:38,313
- We got it. - Goodness.

758
00:27:39,383 --> 00:27:41,463
Didn't I tell you that we're getting off work early?

759
00:27:41,543 --> 00:27:44,951
The male flower on a corn plant is on top of the stem.

760
00:27:44,952 --> 00:27:47,682
The female flower blooms on the side of the stem.

761
00:27:48,123 --> 00:27:51,692
When pollen from the male flower falls on the female stigma,

762
00:27:51,892 --> 00:27:54,391
which is corn silk, pollination takes place.

763
00:27:54,392 --> 00:27:56,063
That's where corn kernels form.

764
00:27:56,232 --> 00:28:00,602
Kernels form as many as the number of corn silk strands.

765
00:28:00,603 --> 00:28:03,323
That's why the number of kernels and corn silk strands are the same.

766
00:28:04,603 --> 00:28:06,472
It's similar to the hair example.

767
00:28:07,002 --> 00:28:08,543
What I said sounded strange.

768
00:28:09,573 --> 00:28:10,741
Here's what we have to eat.

769
00:28:10,742 --> 00:28:13,141
(Food that Team Handsome will eat)

770
00:28:13,142 --> 00:28:14,412
- Kimchi? - Kimchi?

771
00:28:15,182 --> 00:28:16,182
(Iksan: Corn Toast Bread)

772
00:28:16,313 --> 00:28:17,313

773
00:28:17,314 --> 00:28:20,221
(Simple!)

774
00:28:20,222 --> 00:28:21,622
We can buy it at the convenience store.

775
00:28:21,623 --> 00:28:23,251
- It will be salty. - Let's hurry and eat it.

776
00:28:23,252 --> 00:28:24,691
We can buy it at a convenience store and eat it on our way.

777
00:28:24,692 --> 00:28:26,822
Sir, do you have any kimchi?

778
00:28:26,823 --> 00:28:28,221
(Sir, do you have any kimchi?)

779
00:28:28,222 --> 00:28:29,431
Kimchi at a bakery?

780
00:28:29,432 --> 00:28:30,892
(That's ridiculous.)

781
00:28:33,133 --> 00:28:34,602
- Corn. - Corn.

782
00:28:34,603 --> 00:28:42,043
(Iksan: Corn Toast Bread)

783
00:28:42,442 --> 00:28:43,442
That's great.

784
00:28:43,443 --> 00:28:44,512
- We're off to a good start. - We're off to a good start.

785
00:28:44,513 --> 00:28:46,181
We need to decide where we're going.

786
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,442
Let's go to Imsil...

787
00:28:47,982 --> 00:28:49,312
and head to Buan.

788
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:51,513
(They plan out their route.)

789
00:28:51,712 --> 00:28:53,083
The other team won't sit back.

790
00:28:53,353 --> 00:28:55,892
(Thinking)

791
00:28:56,023 --> 00:28:57,353
Let's do this.

792
00:28:58,192 --> 00:28:59,221
I got it.

793
00:28:59,222 --> 00:29:01,491
Instead of taking our chance,

794
00:29:01,492 --> 00:29:02,492
we'll go to Gimje.

795
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:04,391
If the others win Imsil,

796
00:29:04,392 --> 00:29:05,832
we can block them.

797
00:29:05,833 --> 00:29:07,132
Then we can go to Gunsan.

798
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:09,532
We will have these two rows...

799
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:11,732
as a checkmate.

800
00:29:12,472 --> 00:29:14,272
- Gimje is a good idea. - We can check their location.

801
00:29:14,273 --> 00:29:15,489
- We can check their location. - Okay.

802
00:29:15,513 --> 00:29:16,542
This is great.

803
00:29:16,543 --> 00:29:18,681
We'll get some kimchi to go...

804
00:29:18,682 --> 00:29:20,543
- and head to Gimje. - Let's go.

805
00:29:21,013 --> 00:29:22,052
Let's go.

00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:24,552
(With John Park's great performance, they head to Gimje.)

808
00:29:26,783 --> 00:29:27,783

- Is this famous? - Yes.

829

00:32:27,103 --> 00:32:28,823
- for a reason. - Would you like a big one?

905
00:32:29,502 --> 00:32:31,103
How many candles?

906
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,972
Fifty candles.

907
00:32:33,843 --> 00:32:34,872
Fifty?

908
00:32:34,873 --> 00:32:36,542
- Gosh. - Make it...

909
00:32:36,543 --> 00:32:38,612
- forty-five candles instead. - Forty-five?

910
00:32:38,613 --> 00:32:39,641
(Clapping)

911
00:32:39,642 --> 00:32:41,322
- Shall we get number candles? - Shall we?

912
00:32:41,583 --> 00:32:42,812
I'll bring number candles.

913
00:32:42,813 --> 00:32:44,552
(Sir?)

914
00:32:44,553 --> 00:32:46,583
We can use number candles if she wants to.

915
00:32:48,583 --> 00:32:50,123
How about...

916
00:32:50,523 --> 00:32:52,122
a heart-shaped candle and make it cute?

917
00:32:52,123 --> 00:32:53,921
- One heart-shaped candle? - Yes, that's better.

918
00:32:53,922 --> 00:32:55,162
One's age is...

919
00:32:55,593 --> 00:32:57,962
He already told us her age.

920
00:32:58,462 --> 00:32:59,462
Make it pretty.

921
00:32:59,463 --> 00:33:02,201
(They acted fast to protect peace in the family.)

922
00:33:02,202 --> 00:33:03,432
Your niece should join us.

923
00:33:03,472 --> 00:33:04,472
Start.

924
00:33:04,473 --> 00:33:10,012
(Happy birthday to you)

925
00:33:10,013 --> 00:33:13,411
(Dear Baker's wife and Hyo Jin)

926
00:33:13,412 --> 00:33:17,053
(Happy birthday to you)

927
00:33:18,553 --> 00:33:19,752
Happy birthday.

928
00:33:20,053 --> 00:33:21,752
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

929
00:33:22,082 --> 00:33:23,192
Happy birthday.

930
00:33:23,852 --> 00:33:25,222
- Congratulations. - Thank you so much.

931
00:33:25,223 --> 00:33:26,323
This is amazing.

932
00:33:27,292 --> 00:33:30,262
We're grateful to be able to wish you happy birthday.

933
00:33:30,263 --> 00:33:32,402
- This was the best gift ever. - You're too kind.

934
00:33:33,663 --> 00:33:35,133
The cake... Right.

935
00:33:35,772 --> 00:33:37,001
We usually give you the cake...

936
00:33:37,002 --> 00:33:38,202
- after wishing happy birthday. - Really?

937
00:33:38,203 --> 00:33:40,072
Yes, of course we leave it with you.

938
00:33:40,073 --> 00:33:42,512
But it feels weird to leave the cake with the bakery owner...

939
00:33:42,513 --> 00:33:43,912
- especially when it's one of hers. - Still.

940
00:33:43,913 --> 00:33:45,882
Still, we'll leave it to wish you a happy birthday.

941
00:33:45,883 --> 00:33:47,512
- The niece can have it. - Thank you.

942
00:33:47,513 --> 00:33:49,811
- Thank you. - The pleasure was ours.

943
00:33:49,812 --> 00:33:51,082
- Thank you. - Right.

944
00:33:52,683 --> 00:33:55,053
It's my first time getting a cake on my birthday.

945
00:33:58,093 --> 00:33:59,363
Should we give them some?

946
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:02,561
They got you the cake for your birthday,

947
00:34:02,562 --> 00:34:04,232
so you should have it.

948
00:34:04,593 --> 00:34:06,901
Even though I bake cakes,

949
00:34:06,902 --> 00:34:09,671
I never got her one on her birthday.

950
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,973
What an honour.

951
00:34:14,473 --> 00:34:16,042
I'm touched.

952
00:34:17,812 --> 00:34:19,311
Things are going smoothly.

953
00:34:19,312 --> 00:34:20,481
(They were able to successfully wrap up an event.)

954
00:34:20,482 --> 00:34:21,922
I can't believe it was her birthday.

955
00:34:22,453 --> 00:34:23,651
No way.

956
00:34:23,652 --> 00:34:25,412
(Time to taste the rice castella)

957
00:34:25,413 --> 00:34:28,052
This must be so famous to sell 200 a day.

958
00:34:28,053 --> 00:34:30,093
- Tell me about it. - A rice one is a first for me.

959
00:34:30,622 --> 00:34:32,252
- Same here. - Here you go.

960
00:34:34,062 --> 00:34:36,561
- I can smell the rice. - Really?

961
00:34:36,562 --> 00:34:38,362
- At the very end. - Really?

962
00:34:38,363 --> 00:34:40,323
(This castella that gives off a nutty rice scent)

963
00:34:40,462 --> 00:34:43,133
(Nutty rice harvested in North Jeolla Province)

964
00:34:43,602 --> 00:34:46,942
(A heap of it is ground.)

965
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:50,812
(Lots of eggs!)

966
00:34:51,272 --> 00:34:55,243
(Whisked to add air into the batter)

967
00:34:56,582 --> 00:34:59,622
(Fluffiness created from our own rice)

968
00:35:02,823 --> 00:35:05,022
This must be enjoyed with milk.

969
00:35:05,292 --> 00:35:07,252
I can have three packets of these if I have milk.

970
00:35:07,363 --> 00:35:08,462
I mean it.

971
00:35:08,663 --> 00:35:10,332
I'll load up on carbs today.

972
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,902
Say no more.

973
00:35:15,303 --> 00:35:18,073
(Immediately sipping his milk)

974
00:35:27,442 --> 00:35:28,613
You know,

975
00:35:28,812 --> 00:35:31,053
- this seems fluffier. - Right.

976
00:35:32,622 --> 00:35:33,922
It's not that...

977
00:35:34,352 --> 00:35:36,192
this is tastier because it was made with rice.

978
00:35:36,393 --> 00:35:38,521
It tastes the same as the fluffy castellas...

979
00:35:38,522 --> 00:35:40,461
I've had before.

980
00:35:40,462 --> 00:35:41,823
But I'm amazed...

981
00:35:42,533 --> 00:35:44,332
that it was made with rice.

982
00:35:45,462 --> 00:35:46,702
(A bite of the castella)

983
00:35:46,703 --> 00:35:47,731
And then...

984
00:35:47,732 --> 00:35:50,633
(Followed by a sip of milk)

985
00:35:54,303 --> 00:35:56,811
When you soak the castella in your mouth with milk...

986
00:35:56,812 --> 00:35:58,912
(A foolproof combo that has you gulping it down)

987
00:35:58,913 --> 00:36:00,113
That's how I eat one.

988
00:36:00,413 --> 00:36:02,042
The next one will be dunked in the milk.

989
00:36:03,482 --> 00:36:05,452
Have you tried eating it soaked with milk...

990
00:36:05,453 --> 00:36:06,981
- as a kid? - A lot actually.

991
00:36:06,982 --> 00:36:08,581
If you get greedy and dunk it too deep,

992
00:36:08,582 --> 00:36:10,022
- half of it will fall off. - Right.

993
00:36:10,692 --> 00:36:11,752
Dip it gently.

994
00:36:15,562 --> 00:36:16,562
Like that.

995
00:36:17,163 --> 00:36:18,363
There's already less milk.

996
00:36:18,462 --> 00:36:20,332
- The top fell off. - The top fell off.

997
00:36:23,573 --> 00:36:25,601
You know how delicious this top part is.

998
00:36:25,602 --> 00:36:27,643
Of course. I'm gulping all of it down at once.

999
00:36:28,902 --> 00:36:30,342
It's coming apart.

1000
00:36:30,343 --> 00:36:33,343
(Now properly loading up on carbs)

1001
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,482
I'm so happy.

1002
00:36:36,852 --> 00:36:38,151
I should have one more.

1003
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:39,152
(One more pack of carbs)

1004
00:36:39,153 --> 00:36:40,851
The milk beat me once,

1005
00:36:40,852 --> 00:36:42,121
so I'm dipping it in the other way.

1006
00:36:42,122 --> 00:36:44,042
(He dips it in the other way to secure the top!)

1007
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:47,823
All right.

1008
00:36:52,292 --> 00:36:53,462
This is crazy.

1009
00:37:00,643 --> 00:37:03,812
(They're done loading up on carbs.)

1010
00:37:09,212 --> 00:37:11,413
This is the highlight.

1011
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:13,552
The highlight.

1012
00:37:13,553 --> 00:37:15,022
(This is the real deal.)

1013
00:37:16,723 --> 00:37:18,291
(Yummy)

1014
00:37:18,292 --> 00:37:21,522
(Now, he's finally done loading up on carbs.)

1015
00:37:22,062 --> 00:37:23,263
This is incredible.

1016
00:37:24,133 --> 00:37:25,192
I'd love to buy a few.

1017
00:37:25,393 --> 00:37:27,662
I'd give this to my children daily if this were in my neighbourhood.

1018
00:37:27,663 --> 00:37:28,802
(The soft sweet flavours would be a hit even with the kids.)

1019
00:37:28,803 --> 00:37:30,033
This might not...

1020
00:37:30,172 --> 00:37:33,073
- be appropriate to say to you. - Yes?

1021
00:37:33,402 --> 00:37:35,742
But I'm so happy right now I don't care who wins.

1022
00:37:35,743 --> 00:37:37,512
- I'm in bliss as well. - Same here.

1023
00:37:37,513 --> 00:37:38,541
(Joy was given to them in the form of sugar.)

1024
00:37:38,542 --> 00:37:41,413
Out of 13 episodes, you can enjoy one in that sense.

1025
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:44,682
Right?

1026
00:37:44,683 --> 00:37:47,521
Korean variety shows should now take a different approach.

1027
00:37:47,522 --> 00:37:48,522
In what way?

1028
00:37:48,523 --> 00:37:49,751
- Let us relax... - Right.

1029
00:37:49,752 --> 00:37:51,593
And learn things in a serious way.

1030
00:37:51,953 --> 00:37:54,822
Of course we should seek laughter,

1031
00:37:54,823 --> 00:37:57,763
but we should find meaning and talk things out.

1032
00:37:57,832 --> 00:37:59,461
Since we're in Gunsan,

1033
00:37:59,462 --> 00:38:01,139
we should feel what this place has to offer.

1034
00:38:01,163 --> 00:38:02,533
Something like that.

1035
00:38:02,832 --> 00:38:04,432
By the way, when do we get our question?

1036
00:38:05,172 --> 00:38:06,172
Once we're done eating.

1037
00:38:06,173 --> 00:38:08,078
- Once we're done eating? - We'll soon be given the question.

1038
00:38:08,102 --> 00:38:10,913
You're more competitive than you let on.

1039
00:38:11,143 --> 00:38:13,783
You say we should relax, but you're competitive.

1040
00:38:14,343 --> 00:38:17,812
(You still have the jjamppong bun.)

1041
00:38:18,553 --> 00:38:20,323
(Goodness)

1042
00:38:20,482 --> 00:38:21,581
Check this out.

1043
00:38:21,582 --> 00:38:23,922
Hyuk, there's jjamppong in here.

1044
00:38:26,192 --> 00:38:28,323
Gosh, check out the filling.

1045
00:38:28,792 --> 00:38:31,033
There's a lot of filling in this.

1046
00:38:31,933 --> 00:38:35,432
How did he even think to put jjamppong in here?

1047
00:38:35,433 --> 00:38:37,102
This looks incredible.

1048
00:38:37,772 --> 00:38:39,001
- Try it. - Sure.

1049
00:38:39,002 --> 00:38:40,102
Try this.

1050
00:38:40,902 --> 00:38:42,073
Have the bigger piece.

1051
00:38:42,343 --> 00:38:43,473
I'll have this.

1052
00:38:50,183 --> 00:38:51,382
(Yummy)

1053
00:38:51,383 --> 00:38:52,823
No way. This works.

1054
00:38:54,752 --> 00:38:56,352
No way. This works.

1055
00:38:57,152 --> 00:38:59,562
(Yummy)

1056
00:39:00,522 --> 00:39:02,692
It's like the pizza buns we have...

1057
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:05,633
but it also tastes like jjamppong.

1058
00:39:06,203 --> 00:39:08,961
- It's like a pizza croquette. - Yes, a croquette.

1059
00:39:08,962 --> 00:39:10,831
- A croquette. - It's exactly like a croquette.

1060
00:39:10,832 --> 00:39:13,772
- There's even a squid here. - I'm full.

1061
00:39:14,502 --> 00:39:15,671
I'm so full.

1062
00:39:15,672 --> 00:39:17,972
(He polishes it off.)

1063
00:39:17,973 --> 00:39:19,171
All right.

1064
00:39:19,172 --> 00:39:21,283
We've been lucky today so far.

1065
00:39:21,542 --> 00:39:23,613
- We're off to a great start. - Right.

1066
00:39:24,152 --> 00:39:25,782
- All right. - We can do this. Just relax.

1067
00:39:25,783 --> 00:39:27,052
- Take Hyuk's advice. - Relax.

1068
00:39:27,053 --> 00:39:28,533
Can't the owner try and guess it too?

1069
00:39:29,292 --> 00:39:31,251
If you know the answer,

1070
00:39:31,252 --> 00:39:33,262
feel free to say it out loud.

1071
00:39:33,263 --> 00:39:34,421
- Because... - We...

1072
00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:35,662
(Giggling)

1073
00:39:35,663 --> 00:39:37,932
- Here's the quiz. - Please give me one I know.

1074
00:39:37,933 --> 00:39:40,732
I want there to be one where I know the answer instantaneously.

1075
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:43,633
Gunsan is famous for its rice.

1076
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:46,771
Rice is a typical gluten-free grain...

1077
00:39:46,772 --> 00:39:50,073
that can be a substitute for flour.

1078
00:39:50,372 --> 00:39:52,682
- Which of the following... - It's a multiple-choice.

1079
00:39:52,683 --> 00:39:55,913
Has gluten in it?

1080
00:39:56,383 --> 00:39:58,453
A, potato.

1081
00:39:59,212 --> 00:40:01,122
B, buckwheat.

1082
00:40:01,852 --> 00:40:03,692
C, barley.

1083
00:40:04,553 --> 00:40:06,122
D, almond.

1084
00:40:14,732 --> 00:40:15,863
It suddenly got tougher.

1085
00:40:15,933 --> 00:40:18,433
Why is almond among the choices?

1086
00:40:20,102 --> 00:40:21,142
Why?

1087
00:40:21,143 --> 00:40:22,342
(For some reason, it's highly suspicious.)

1088
00:40:22,343 --> 00:40:23,843
Why is almond among the choices?

1089
00:40:24,413 --> 00:40:26,282
I don't think we have to consider almond.

1090
00:40:26,283 --> 00:40:28,683
- On purpose? - It seems like bait.

1091
00:40:28,743 --> 00:40:31,052
You're right. We can exclude it.

1092
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,282
Can we exclude it?

1093
00:40:32,283 --> 00:40:34,383
There's a lot in flour but none in rice.

1094
00:40:35,323 --> 00:40:36,351
Then buckwheat.

1095
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,952
It's in wheat, so buckwheat will have it too.

1096
00:40:37,953 --> 00:40:39,393
(Because there's wheat in buckwheat)

1097
00:40:39,692 --> 00:40:40,762
What has gluten?

1098
00:40:40,763 --> 00:40:43,393
I just saw the producer's expression.

1099
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:44,731
(Me?)

1100
00:40:44,732 --> 00:40:46,061
- This is a mind game. - I know.

1101
00:40:46,062 --> 00:40:47,731
- I see people's expressions. - Those who do martial arts...

1102
00:40:47,732 --> 00:40:49,633
are experts at mind games.

1103
00:40:49,973 --> 00:40:51,771
Why did they choose this as a question?

1104
00:40:51,772 --> 00:40:52,842
- Exactly. - Also,

1105
00:40:52,843 --> 00:40:55,802
why did they bring us to a bakery?

1106
00:40:55,803 --> 00:40:57,912
What of the following has to do with bread?

1107
00:40:57,913 --> 00:41:00,383
- Right. - We should consider that.

1108
00:41:00,913 --> 00:41:02,542
What do you think the answer is?

1109
00:41:02,913 --> 00:41:04,783
Without thinking too hard, I say it's barley.

1110
00:41:05,283 --> 00:41:06,521
Barley? Why?

1111
00:41:06,522 --> 00:41:07,682
(Why do you think it's barley?)

1112
00:41:07,683 --> 00:41:09,352
Barley, barley, barley.

1113
00:41:09,953 --> 00:41:11,222
- What? - No reason.

1114
00:41:11,223 --> 00:41:12,452
No reason?

1115
00:41:12,453 --> 00:41:13,592
(I just think it's barley.)

1116
00:41:13,593 --> 00:41:15,521
- We don't have any chance cards. - The rice-barley game.

1117
00:41:15,522 --> 00:41:16,662
Rice and barley?

1118
00:41:16,663 --> 00:41:18,032
Because of the rice-barley game?

1119
00:41:18,033 --> 00:41:20,803
There's no reason behind it. It's a wild guess.

1120
00:41:21,163 --> 00:41:22,502
Because of the rice-barley game?

1121
00:41:22,772 --> 00:41:24,831
You can't just say it's barley.

1122
00:41:24,832 --> 00:41:26,972
If we get this wrong, we'll be at...

1123
00:41:26,973 --> 00:41:28,942
a huge disadvantage.

1124
00:41:29,643 --> 00:41:31,413
There's gluten in wheat.

1125
00:41:32,513 --> 00:41:33,582
I don't know.

1126
00:41:33,812 --> 00:41:35,342
- It's in wheat. - This book.

1127
00:41:35,343 --> 00:41:36,589
(His lack of trust makes him want to read.)

1128
00:41:36,613 --> 00:41:38,152
We're allowed to read, right?

1129
00:41:39,013 --> 00:41:41,121
- What book is that? - It was here to begin with.

1130
00:41:41,122 --> 00:41:42,652
A textbook for the patissier test.

1131
00:41:43,723 --> 00:41:45,722
- Is it in there? - Check it out, guys.

1132
00:41:45,723 --> 00:41:47,893
I'll find something else that could help us.

1133
00:41:48,292 --> 00:41:50,461
As if the answer would be in here.

1134
00:41:50,462 --> 00:41:51,462
(King of Reading)

1135
00:41:51,933 --> 00:41:53,163
It could be in here.

1136
00:41:54,332 --> 00:41:56,001
You never know.

1137
00:41:56,002 --> 00:41:57,203
(Something could be in here.)

1138
00:41:59,573 --> 00:42:01,441
(It has suddenly become a library.)

1139
00:42:01,442 --> 00:42:02,643
My gosh.

1140
00:42:03,473 --> 00:42:04,842
- Gliadin. - Hold on.

1141
00:42:04,843 --> 00:42:06,643
It could show up in this book.

1142
00:42:07,212 --> 00:42:09,081
"Gliadin and glutenin in flour..."

1143
00:42:09,082 --> 00:42:11,883
"bind together to form gluten."

1144
00:42:12,053 --> 00:42:15,521
"Various types of bread can be made by choosing a different flour..."

1145
00:42:15,522 --> 00:42:18,552
"such as medium flour, weak flour, wholemeal, rye, and others."

1146
00:42:18,553 --> 00:42:19,893
- That's all it says. - Right.

1147
00:42:19,922 --> 00:42:21,522
- That's all it says. - I have no idea.

1148
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,663
The word glutenin is in here.

1149
00:42:24,062 --> 00:42:26,703
Either way, I chose my answer...

1150
00:42:27,133 --> 00:42:29,402
based on no exact reason.

1151
00:42:29,933 --> 00:42:32,573
I made an educated guess...

1152
00:42:33,243 --> 00:42:35,371
which is why I don't find this situation...

1153
00:42:35,372 --> 00:42:37,042
to be serious.

1154
00:42:37,212 --> 00:42:38,441
You need to take this a bit seriously.

1155
00:42:38,442 --> 00:42:41,142
If we get this wrong, we'll be at a huge disadvantage.

1156
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:44,013
My gut is telling me it's barley.

1157
00:42:44,453 --> 00:42:47,552
Your gut feeling has been on point today.

1158
00:42:47,553 --> 00:42:49,892
- Exactly. - I want to go with your answer,

1159
00:42:49,893 --> 00:42:51,393
but it's too out of the blue.

1160
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:53,092
The rice-barley game?

1161
00:42:53,093 --> 00:42:54,961
I'd love to take your side.

1162
00:42:54,962 --> 00:42:56,592
- If you had said... - Hyuk...

1163
00:42:56,593 --> 00:42:58,392
you had heard it from somewhere, I'd go with it.

1164
00:42:58,393 --> 00:42:59,831
If only you had lied...

1165
00:42:59,832 --> 00:43:01,231
- about knowing it from somewhere. - Right.

1166
00:43:01,232 --> 00:43:03,033
We would've gone with it.

1167
00:43:03,332 --> 00:43:04,972
It was too out of the blue...

1168
00:43:04,973 --> 00:43:06,573
which is why we can't.

1169
00:43:06,772 --> 00:43:08,002
I'm clueless.

1170
00:43:08,102 --> 00:43:10,271
I personally think it's potato.

1171
00:43:10,272 --> 00:43:11,613
- Potato? - What about you?

1172
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,441
Every multiple-choice question...

1173
00:43:14,442 --> 00:43:18,252
has a choice that messes with your head.

1174
00:43:18,652 --> 00:43:20,053
See buckwheat, for example.

1175
00:43:20,152 --> 00:43:22,251
We see that in a lot of dishes.

1176
00:43:22,252 --> 00:43:24,121
I think that was put in there...

1177
00:43:24,122 --> 00:43:25,252
to throw us off.

1178
00:43:25,723 --> 00:43:27,022
It's actually gluten-free.

1179
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:29,292
Let's cross out buckwheat.

1180
00:43:29,863 --> 00:43:31,263
Almond is...

1181
00:43:31,663 --> 00:43:34,102
Many times, the least suspicious one was the answer.

1182
00:43:34,163 --> 00:43:36,632
- We shouldn't think so much. - Potato?

1183
00:43:36,633 --> 00:43:38,101
(2. Buckwheat)

1184
00:43:38,102 --> 00:43:39,573
This is what we should do.

1185
00:43:39,872 --> 00:43:42,401
Let's count almond out.

1186
00:43:42,402 --> 00:43:44,112
If we get it wrong because it was almond,

1187
00:43:44,113 --> 00:43:46,283
I'll leave, saying, "Gosh. That was unfair."

1188
00:43:46,413 --> 00:43:48,581
- You'll leave. - As for buckwheat...

1189
00:43:48,582 --> 00:43:50,352
There's no way buckwheat is the answer.

1190
00:43:50,553 --> 00:43:52,883
That's all I can give you. Now, you two can decide.

1191
00:43:52,982 --> 00:43:55,723
I don't think barley has gluten.

1192
00:43:56,122 --> 00:43:58,053
Potato?

1193
00:43:58,522 --> 00:43:59,962
I'm talking in a vague way.

1194
00:43:59,993 --> 00:44:02,291
- The ansure is potato. - "Ansure."

1195
00:44:02,292 --> 00:44:03,493
The ansure is potato.

1196
00:44:04,033 --> 00:44:05,192
- Or... - Okay?

1197
00:44:05,493 --> 00:44:07,502
- Should we go for potato? - Yes.

1198
00:44:07,803 --> 00:44:09,101
- Potato. - It's 55 versus 45.

1199
00:44:09,102 --> 00:44:10,731
- Even if we get it wrong, - It's a 50 percent chance.

1200
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:12,401
- let's accept the loss... - Yes.

1201
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:13,743
- and move on. - Okay.

1202
00:44:13,843 --> 00:44:14,941
- What now? - Let's say it together.

1203
00:44:14,942 --> 00:44:16,672
- It's 59 versus 41. It's the same. - Okay.

1204
00:44:17,212 --> 00:44:18,842
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

1205
00:44:18,843 --> 00:44:19,882
- Potato. - Potato.

1206
00:44:19,883 --> 00:44:20,981
That's your answer.

1207
00:44:20,982 --> 00:44:22,112
The ansure is potato.

1208
00:44:22,113 --> 00:44:23,711
Say "Answer," not "Ansure."

1209
00:44:23,712 --> 00:44:25,481
- That's our answer. - Your answer is potato.

1210
00:44:25,482 --> 00:44:26,582
Answer.

1211
00:44:27,053 --> 00:44:28,183
Potato.

1212
00:44:29,352 --> 00:44:30,552
That was so confusing.

1213
00:44:30,553 --> 00:44:31,722
(Ominous)

1214
00:44:31,723 --> 00:44:32,823
That was so confusing.

1215
00:44:33,022 --> 00:44:34,163
Please.

1216
00:44:35,096 --> 00:44:36,396
(A. Potato)

1217
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:38,560
- Incorrect. - What was the answer?

1218
00:44:38,561 --> 00:44:40,460
- What was the answer? - Wait. Time out.

1219
00:44:40,461 --> 00:44:41,960
Just don't tell me that it was barley.

1220
00:44:41,961 --> 00:44:43,600
- What's the answer? - The answer is...

1221
00:44:43,601 --> 00:44:45,060
(Please.)

1222
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:46,130
Number three, barley.

1223
00:44:46,131 --> 00:44:47,569
I told you!

1224
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:48,969
I said it was barley.

1225
00:44:48,970 --> 00:44:50,469
(The rice-barley game logic was correct.)

1226
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:52,941
- I told you so. - I know.

1227
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,041
I have a good hunch today.

1228
00:44:56,211 --> 00:44:58,139
See? I told you that it was barley.

1229
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,680
My hunch kept telling me that it was barely.

1230
00:45:01,251 --> 00:45:03,179
There was a reason why we had barley...

1231
00:45:03,180 --> 00:45:05,196
during the barley hump, the period of spring poverty.

1232
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:07,650
- Gosh. You're good. - Yes.

1233
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:09,320
But if you had explained...

1234
00:45:09,351 --> 00:45:12,021
the reasoning behind it a little...

1235
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,159
Just like now, you should have said, "When we were young,"

1236
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,400
"there was the barley hump, so I think it's the answer."

1237
00:45:17,561 --> 00:45:20,900
But instead, you were like, "The rice-barley game."

1238
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:22,000
Gosh. Potato is gluten-free.

1239
00:45:22,001 --> 00:45:23,199
Let it go.

1240
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:24,400
- Okay. We got it. - Okay.

1241
00:45:24,401 --> 00:45:26,040
- Let's go to Gimje. - Let's hurry.

1242
00:45:26,041 --> 00:45:27,569
- We'll get going. - To Gimje.

1243
00:45:27,570 --> 00:45:29,139
- We'll head to Gimje. - Where are you going again?

1244
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,639
- To Gimje. - We'll go to the closest one.

1245
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,480
- The closest one. - Yes. We'll go to Gimje. Let's go.

1246
00:45:32,481 --> 00:45:34,179
Today, we'll move along without thinking so much.

1247
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,986
- That's what we'll do. Yes. - We'll get going.

1248
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:37,421
Do you want to go to the arcade?

1249
00:45:37,481 --> 00:45:39,279
- Should we go to the arcade? - We have to go to the arcade too.

1250
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:40,997
- Let's go to the arcade. - We have to go there.

1251
00:45:41,021 --> 00:45:42,650
(Searching quickly)

1252
00:45:42,651 --> 00:45:43,819
Haetae Arcade.

1253
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:45,090
There's one nearby.

1254
00:45:45,291 --> 00:45:46,360
Should we walk...

1255
00:45:46,361 --> 00:45:47,636
- since our car is already parked? - Yes.

1256
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:48,831
We'll get going.

1257
00:45:49,430 --> 00:45:51,230
(Iksan: Corn Toast Bread)

1258
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,460
Gosh. That was close.

1259
00:45:52,461 --> 00:45:54,929
(Team Guys failed to occupy Gunsan.)

1260
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:56,699
(Gunsan)

1261
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,869
(They'll try to finish the remaining mission in Gunsan.)

1262
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:01,409
(In the meantime, Team Handsome is...)

1263
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:02,940
(Iksan)

1264
00:46:02,941 --> 00:46:04,881
Gosh. We'll get going.

1265
00:46:05,441 --> 00:46:06,449
(Iksan: Kimchi)

1266
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:08,449
Someone can eat this.

1267
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:11,120
Can you hand me the paper with the address on it?

1268
00:46:11,151 --> 00:46:13,351
- Kimje's C Hotteok. - C Hotteok.

1269
00:46:13,791 --> 00:46:16,361
We solved the quiz without using the hint.

1270
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:18,160
- That was amazing. - I'm relieved.

1271
00:46:18,490 --> 00:46:21,131
The remaining two quizzes will be a piece of cake now.

1272
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:23,630
- We can use the reattempt cards. - Exactly.

1273
00:46:23,631 --> 00:46:25,400
We'll arrive in just 30 minutes.

1274
00:46:25,401 --> 00:46:27,771
Gosh. I love it. It's a short drive.

1275
00:46:27,901 --> 00:46:30,040
John, I didn't know...

1276
00:46:30,041 --> 00:46:32,322
you were so enthusiastic about and good at variety shows.

1277
00:46:32,901 --> 00:46:35,271
No. I'm not that good.

1278
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:38,581
Your daughter has changed you.

1279
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:41,180
(Smiling)

1280
00:46:41,651 --> 00:46:42,810
(After getting married in 2022)

1281
00:46:42,811 --> 00:46:44,921
(he has become a happy father to a daughter.)

1282
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:46,219
I'm jealous.

1283
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,320
(I'm jealous.)

1284
00:46:48,521 --> 00:46:50,220
I thought I'd be married by now.

1285
00:46:50,561 --> 00:46:52,220
Did you have that feeling?

1286
00:46:52,490 --> 00:46:54,929
When you met your wife,

1287
00:46:54,930 --> 00:46:56,901
did you think, "I think I'm going to marry her."

1288
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,430
Yes.

1289
00:46:58,831 --> 00:47:00,500
- I had that feeling at some point. - That exact feeling?

1290
00:47:00,501 --> 00:47:02,207
It was my first time to have such a feeling.

1291
00:47:02,231 --> 00:47:03,799
I didn't think...

1292
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:05,520
- that I was going to get married. - I see.

1293
00:47:05,601 --> 00:47:07,670
I have a question about one thing.

1294
00:47:07,671 --> 00:47:10,440
Did you have a feeling that your life would be stable...

1295
00:47:10,441 --> 00:47:12,940
when you married her?

1296
00:47:12,941 --> 00:47:14,350
- Yes. - Was that it?

1297
00:47:14,351 --> 00:47:17,581
Of course, I love her...

1298
00:47:18,021 --> 00:47:21,351
as a woman too.

1299
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:24,291
But at the same time,

1300
00:47:24,861 --> 00:47:28,990
she is someone who's stable.

1301
00:47:29,030 --> 00:47:31,601
She grew up in a loving home.

1302
00:47:31,831 --> 00:47:33,970
Her family is very harmonious.

1303
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,569
Those aspects of her...

1304
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:37,740
made me...

1305
00:47:38,570 --> 00:47:40,311
open my eyes about getting married.

1306
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:42,811
That's awesome.

1307
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,510
Your wife...

1308
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,811
has a younger sister, right?

1309
00:47:47,881 --> 00:47:49,210
She has an older sister and a younger brother.

1310
00:47:49,211 --> 00:47:50,731
- A total of three. - An older sister.

1311
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,450
Is her sister single?

1312
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:56,989
She's married and lives in the US.

1313
00:47:56,990 --> 00:47:58,219
She's far away.

1314
00:47:58,220 --> 00:47:59,990
She's in America.

1315
00:48:00,061 --> 00:48:01,430
Just in case.

1316
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:03,460
If we can be a family, it'd be...

1317
00:48:03,461 --> 00:48:04,861
(If we can be a family, it'd be...)

1318
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,601
I think of you

1319
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:12,400
(Meantime, in the back of the car)

1320
00:48:12,401 --> 00:48:15,569
(Opening the kimchi package quietly)

1321
00:48:15,570 --> 00:48:16,779
(Starting the mission)

1322
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:17,941
It looks good.

1323
00:48:18,441 --> 00:48:22,910
(Taking a bite)

1324
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:26,320
(Crunchy)

1325
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:29,450
Kimchi can't go wrong.

1326
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,361
- It's good. - Of course.

1327
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:33,830
(Passing kimchi to the front seats)

1328
00:48:33,831 --> 00:48:34,929
Chopsticks.

1329
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:37,159
- Please hand me the garlic bread. - Really?

1330
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,529
(He gets the garlic bread they got as a gift from Iksan.)

1331
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:39,870
It's freshly out of the oven.

1332
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:43,670
(Eating the garlic bread first)

1333
00:48:43,671 --> 00:48:48,171
(And eating Kimchi after that)

1334
00:48:48,470 --> 00:48:49,640
Garlic...

1335
00:48:49,771 --> 00:48:50,839
is sweet.

1336
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,940
I told you that you're my only love

1337
00:48:52,941 --> 00:48:54,009
It's sweet and salty.

1338
00:48:54,010 --> 00:48:55,810
You know how it is, right, everyone? It's the garlic.

1339
00:48:55,811 --> 00:48:57,151
Who are you talking to?

1340
00:48:57,651 --> 00:48:59,351
- You guys. - "Right, everyone?"

1341
00:48:59,581 --> 00:49:00,650
Everyone as in you guys.

1342
00:49:00,651 --> 00:49:02,811
I thought that camera was for your individual content.

1343
00:49:03,720 --> 00:49:06,020
It goes well with each other, Sang Uk.

1344
00:49:06,021 --> 00:49:07,461
Next, we'll have hotteok.

1345
00:49:07,961 --> 00:49:09,060
Hotteok.

1346
00:49:09,061 --> 00:49:10,260
Hotteok sounds good.

1347
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,659
I love hotteok.

1348
00:49:11,660 --> 00:49:13,369
- Do you like hotteok? - I'm in trouble. Yes.

1349
00:49:13,370 --> 00:49:15,529
I always buy them whenever I see one on the streets.

1350
00:49:15,530 --> 00:49:16,700
You like it that much?

1351
00:49:17,340 --> 00:49:18,840
Especially in winter,

1352
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:20,969
I have to have hotteok and fish-shaped buns.

1353
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:22,240
I love the fishcake broth.

1354
00:49:22,671 --> 00:49:24,839
(Gosh. We just have to have it.)

1355
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,910
I can spend 30 minutes easily while having them.

1356
00:49:27,550 --> 00:49:29,179
(Heading to get hotteok already appearing before them)

1357
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,850
The fishcake broth is amazing...

1358
00:49:30,851 --> 00:49:32,220
- on a freezing day. - Right.

1359
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,151
Wait. We have to study for it.

1360
00:49:34,651 --> 00:49:35,651
Hotteok.

1361
00:49:35,652 --> 00:49:37,861
What does "ho" mean in hotteok?

1362
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:39,659
- "Ho?" - Do you know the answer?

1363
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,430
- No. - Okay. Let me see.

1364
00:49:41,691 --> 00:49:44,130
Right. I wonder what it means.

1365
00:49:44,131 --> 00:49:45,807
Isn't it because you blow on it, like "Ho-ho?"

1366
00:49:45,831 --> 00:49:47,130
- I think I heard of that before. - But...

1367
00:49:47,131 --> 00:49:48,707
Then why is the steamed bun called a steamed bun?

1368
00:49:48,731 --> 00:49:50,601
Because they steam the bun.

1369
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:53,441
- Why is hotteok... - We blow on the steamed bun too.

1370
00:49:53,711 --> 00:49:56,009
Called hotteok?

1371
00:49:56,010 --> 00:49:57,639
- Is it the AI chatbot? - Yes.

1372
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,680
(It responds right away.)

1373
00:50:00,811 --> 00:50:04,550
Hotteok means rice cake from China.

1374
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:06,920
- "Rice cake from China?" - "Ho" means...

1375
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:11,260
It refers to foreign stuff in China in the past.

1376
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,030
What are the other words with the letter "Ho?"

1377
00:50:15,231 --> 00:50:16,630
Foreign "Ho."

1378
00:50:16,631 --> 00:50:18,107
(The words with "Ho," which means foreign?)

1379
00:50:18,131 --> 00:50:19,406
Homyeon, which is glass noodles.

1380
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:20,747
Hobyung, which is Jurchen warriors.

1381
00:50:20,771 --> 00:50:23,601
Those are some of them.

1382
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,869
That's enough.

1383
00:50:25,870 --> 00:50:27,009
(That's enough.)

1384
00:50:27,010 --> 00:50:29,140
It won't be given as the quiz.

1385
00:50:29,211 --> 00:50:31,880
I think it'll be something about hotteok.

1386
00:50:31,881 --> 00:50:34,450
(In a moment, they'll face a shocking question.)

1387
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,880
I wish we could have that drink.

1388
00:50:36,881 --> 00:50:38,619
Gosh, but we can't.

1389
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,190
(They're on their way to an arcade nearby for a mission.)

1390
00:50:40,191 --> 00:50:41,921
Gosh. We can't have it.

1391
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:43,190
I'll finish the mission at once.

1392
00:50:43,191 --> 00:50:44,259
I played Pump It Up a lot...

1393
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:45,319
- when I was a college student. - I can't do it at all.

1394
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,420
I played it a lot.

1395
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:47,961
I've even beat the "Turkish March."

1396
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:52,361
(Singing)

1397
00:50:52,430 --> 00:50:55,601
(Shadow-dancing out of the blue on a street)

1398
00:50:56,601 --> 00:50:59,500
(His foot skills excite them for the result.)

1399
00:50:59,501 --> 00:51:00,711
I played it a lot.

1400
00:51:01,370 --> 00:51:03,640
I remember the songs from it.

1401
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:08,150
I'll finish it in five minutes.

1402
00:51:08,381 --> 00:51:10,651
- Please finish it in one go. - Okay.

1403
00:51:11,021 --> 00:51:12,279
They have it.

1404
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:13,351
Show it to us.

1405
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:16,449
Okay. Let's go, Dong Hyun.

1406
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:17,860
(Seung Ho's in charge of the coins.)

1407
00:51:17,861 --> 00:51:19,219
- I'll finish it right away. - Okay.

1408
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,291
It's hot.

1409
00:51:20,731 --> 00:51:21,790
We have to play the normal level.

1410
00:51:21,791 --> 00:51:23,330
- I can do it with the panels. - You can use the panels.

1411
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:24,759
(The mission is a success...)

1412
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:26,199
(if you get over Grade S on the normal level.)

1413
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,929
- Choose a song you know. - What?

1414
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:29,690
(He tries to choose a song with confidence.)

1415
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:32,100
(Going through the songs one by one)

1416
00:51:32,101 --> 00:51:33,469
Is there an old song?

1417
00:51:33,470 --> 00:51:35,541
(Moving his foot with familiarity)

1418
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,179
("Turkish March")

1419
00:51:38,180 --> 00:51:39,440
This one.

1420
00:51:39,441 --> 00:51:41,610
(What? This one.)

1421
00:51:41,611 --> 00:51:45,150
(It's the "Turkish March" he mentioned about on the way.)

1422
00:51:45,151 --> 00:51:47,921
("Turkish March" by BanYa)

1423
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,750
I'll play the hard mode.

1424
00:51:49,751 --> 00:51:51,219
(He chose the hard mode boldly.)

1425
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:52,961
I've played it many times before.

1426
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:54,490
They have it here.

1427
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:56,291
I'll complete the mission.

1428
00:51:56,631 --> 00:51:59,461
(Chanting)

1429
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:00,869
(Chanting)

1430
00:52:00,870 --> 00:52:01,969
(A wild performance is expected.)

1431
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:03,231
Gosh. I remember this.

1432
00:52:04,441 --> 00:52:05,600
It's a hard one.

1433
00:52:05,601 --> 00:52:06,816
(Dong Hyun's "Turkish March" finally starts now.)

1434
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:07,910
Let's go.

1435
00:52:10,711 --> 00:52:11,840
Wait.

1436
00:52:12,981 --> 00:52:15,111
(What?)

1437
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:19,351
(The arrows are coming up ruthlessly.)

1438
00:52:19,581 --> 00:52:22,950
(Despite his confidence, his steps are tangled up.)

1439
00:52:23,050 --> 00:52:25,089
(Sighing)

1440
00:52:25,090 --> 00:52:26,190
What? It's hard.

1441
00:52:26,191 --> 00:52:27,259
(As the arrows go wild, )

1442
00:52:27,260 --> 00:52:29,530
(the train of misses goes wild too.)

1443
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:31,410
I was in great shape when I was young.

1444
00:52:32,061 --> 00:52:33,299
I guess I was fit back then.

1445
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,300
(His steps are lost.)

1446
00:52:34,301 --> 00:52:36,870
(The misses keep piling up.)

1447
00:52:37,171 --> 00:52:38,171
(The old me)

1448
00:52:38,172 --> 00:52:39,199
My legs hurt.

1449
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:42,611
(I miss you.)

1450
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,280
Gosh.

1451
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,151
(He fails epically in 1 go.)

1452
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:51,920
I was in great shape when I was 20 years old.

1453
00:52:51,921 --> 00:52:53,350
How can one finish it?

1454
00:52:53,351 --> 00:52:54,489
You should have chosen the song well.

1455
00:52:54,490 --> 00:52:56,489
(I'm the king of the rhythm games, Kim Dong Hyun.)

1456
00:52:56,490 --> 00:52:59,961
(My pride doesn't allow me to go out like this.)

1457
00:53:00,691 --> 00:53:02,260
I'll play at the normal level.

1458
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:04,659
I guess I was fit back then.

1459
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,759
(The former king of the rhythm games tries it for the 2nd time...)

1460
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,831
(with his startled legs.)

1461
00:53:08,331 --> 00:53:11,171
(Stepping)

1462
00:53:11,941 --> 00:53:12,941
It's easy.

1463
00:53:13,910 --> 00:53:16,410
(The combo starts to pile up.)

1464
00:53:17,081 --> 00:53:18,310
(The hard mode versus the normal mode)

1465
00:53:18,311 --> 00:53:21,610
(He looks much more stable.)

1466
00:53:21,611 --> 00:53:22,651
It's so easy.

1467
00:53:22,950 --> 00:53:25,151
(Surprised)

1468
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:28,089
(He has already reached 50 combos.)

1469
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:29,120
It's so easy.

1470
00:53:29,191 --> 00:53:31,390
(I knew you could do it.)

1471
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:34,160
(Dong Hyun focuses on his steps until the end.)

1472
00:53:36,390 --> 00:53:37,430
- It's done. - He's good.

1473
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,901
It's done. The normal level is so easy.

1474
00:53:40,970 --> 00:53:43,069
(Will he make it this time?)

1475
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:44,070
Let's go.

1476
00:53:44,071 --> 00:53:45,101
- Okay. - Okay.

1477
00:53:45,671 --> 00:53:47,369
(He even succeeds with a Grade S Plus.)

1478
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:48,839
Yes. I got an S Plus.

1479
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,111
- Hey. - Let's go.

1480
00:53:51,541 --> 00:53:52,711
Where is Seung Ho?

1481
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,611
(He's on a claw machine because he trusts Dong Hyun.)

1482
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,280
(Elaborate)

1483
00:53:59,581 --> 00:54:02,521
(He's on a mission of his own though no one asked him to.)

1484
00:54:03,890 --> 00:54:07,429
(In fact, he succeeds it.)

1485
00:54:07,430 --> 00:54:08,561
Did you get a plushie?

1486
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,030
- I got a cute one from "Minions." - Try it.

1487
00:54:11,401 --> 00:54:12,401
You got one already.

1488
00:54:12,401 --> 00:54:13,401
- Good. - Let's go.

1489
00:54:13,402 --> 00:54:14,731
Let's go.

1490
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,799
Even though I've built up my strength as an athlete,

1491
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,970
I can't beat my youth.

1492
00:54:19,171 --> 00:54:20,340
My legs couldn't keep up.

1493
00:54:21,041 --> 00:54:22,170
After occupying Gimje,

1494
00:54:22,171 --> 00:54:24,651
we'll think of which way to go between the left and the right.

1495
00:54:25,111 --> 00:54:27,311
We've already used all the chance cards.

1496
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:29,811
We've completed all missions.

1497
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:33,021
But the important thing is that we didn't get any stamps.

1498
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,560
That is the most important one.

1499
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:37,660
- We've only been to one place. - Right.

1500
00:54:38,361 --> 00:54:41,030
We can increase them slowly.

1501
00:54:41,191 --> 00:54:42,630
Everything I do this,

1502
00:54:42,631 --> 00:54:44,791
it always feels futile when we get the question wrong.

1503
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:47,501
We only get one chance.

1504
00:54:47,831 --> 00:54:48,831
It's so hard, isn't it?

1505
00:54:48,832 --> 00:54:50,299
(Will they be able to play the remaining games well...)

1506
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,200
(without a reattempt card?)

1507
00:54:53,001 --> 00:54:55,240
(Team Handsome)

1508
00:54:55,840 --> 00:55:00,751
Gosh. This must be the busy downtown of Gimje.

1509
00:55:01,251 --> 00:55:04,020
- I think it's in front of us. - This is it.

1510
00:55:04,021 --> 00:55:05,050
We're here.

1511
00:55:06,521 --> 00:55:10,389
(Gimje: Hotteok)

1512
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:11,790
- Thanks for driving. - It's nothing.

1513
00:55:11,791 --> 00:55:13,061
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1514
00:55:13,631 --> 00:55:15,160
Let's go and have some hotteok.

1515
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,330
- Okay. - Good.

1516
00:55:16,331 --> 00:55:17,831
- Let's go. - Hello.

1517
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,699
- Hello. - Hello.

1518
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:22,130
You look like you're from here.

1519
00:55:22,131 --> 00:55:25,100
Thank you. We heard that your hotteok was famous.

1520
00:55:25,101 --> 00:55:26,600
Gosh. Thank you.

1521
00:55:26,601 --> 00:55:28,570
Can we get three hotteok?

1522
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,380
It's 5 dollars for 4 hotteok.

1523
00:55:30,381 --> 00:55:31,580
- We'll get 4, then. - Please give us 4.

1524
00:55:31,581 --> 00:55:32,839
- We'll have four. - Okay.

1525
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,180
- Sang Uk will have two, right? - That's right.

1526
00:55:35,611 --> 00:55:37,971
Do the rock-paper-scissors, so the winner can get one more.

1527
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:39,751
- He has already won. - No need.

1528
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:42,060
- Look how big he is. - You should come inside.

1529
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:43,760
- Thank you. - Yes.

1530
00:55:44,021 --> 00:55:45,791
Gosh. They look good.

1531
00:55:46,291 --> 00:55:48,029
- Are they taking a photo? - Yes.

1532
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:49,529
- Look. - You're getting filmed.

1533
00:55:49,530 --> 00:55:51,000
(A regular was inside.)

1534
00:55:51,001 --> 00:55:53,060
- Are you here for the hotteok too? - What?

1535
00:55:53,061 --> 00:55:54,446
- Are you here to get some hotteok? - Yes.

1536
00:55:54,470 --> 00:55:55,807
How long have you come here to get hotteok?

1537
00:55:55,831 --> 00:55:56,831
- Here? - Yes.

1538
00:55:56,832 --> 00:55:58,799
Tell them that you're from this town.

1539
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:01,311
It's our town's famous hotteok.

1540
00:56:03,111 --> 00:56:04,541
Hurry and make them.

1541
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,840
Okay.

1542
00:56:07,450 --> 00:56:10,110
(He's cute.)

1543
00:56:10,111 --> 00:56:11,119
- Do you want the fish cake broth? - It looks good.

1544
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,651
- I'd love to. - You too, Sang Uk?

1545
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:13,921
- Yes. - You can take one.

1546
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,151
- Thank you. - Today...

1547
00:56:16,521 --> 00:56:18,659
You have to put some green onions in.

1548
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,889
(He's equipped with good sense to put some green onions in it.)

1549
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:21,989
Gosh. Like I said,

1550
00:56:21,990 --> 00:56:23,330
you can't skip the fish cake broth.

1551
00:56:23,331 --> 00:56:24,799
This is the best in winter.

1552
00:56:24,800 --> 00:56:26,159
(You can't skip the fish cake broth on a cold day.)

1553
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,771
It's the best to have when it's cold.

1554
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:29,630
You'll be on TV.

1555
00:56:29,631 --> 00:56:31,770
(I love it so much.)

1556
00:56:31,771 --> 00:56:34,211
Do you have this hotteok frequently?

1557
00:56:35,410 --> 00:56:36,569
It's a bit far.

1558
00:56:36,570 --> 00:56:39,211
When I come to the downtown, I have it.

1559
00:56:39,441 --> 00:56:42,010
Gosh. It wouldn't be further than where we've come from.

1560
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:44,179
We've come from Seoul.

1561
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:45,380
- From Seoul? - Yes.

1562
00:56:45,381 --> 00:56:46,480
(We've come all the way from Seoul.)

1563
00:56:46,481 --> 00:56:48,490
- I've come from my town. - Is it...

1564
00:56:49,251 --> 00:56:51,120
- Is it far from here? - It's far.

1565
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:53,021
How far is it from here?

1566
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:56,260
It takes about 15 minutes.

1567
00:56:57,260 --> 00:56:58,260
(What? 15 minutes?)

1568
00:56:58,261 --> 00:57:00,200
That means it's right by here.

1569
00:57:00,601 --> 00:57:01,830
(It's far anyway.)

1570
00:57:01,831 --> 00:57:03,671
Is there something you always get here?

1571
00:57:03,771 --> 00:57:05,541
- What? - What is the menu you always get?

1572
00:57:06,001 --> 00:57:07,540
It's hotteok. What else would it be?

1573
00:57:07,541 --> 00:57:08,739
- And fish cake. - Hotteok.

1574
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:10,740
How is this place's hotteok different from others?

1575
00:57:11,881 --> 00:57:13,541
It's different because it's tasty.

1576
00:57:15,611 --> 00:57:16,931
- We have to try it first. - Yes.

1577
00:57:16,981 --> 00:57:18,250
- Try it. - We should try it.

1578
00:57:18,251 --> 00:57:19,720
- Try many. - Okay.

1579
00:57:22,191 --> 00:57:24,190
- Have a safe trip home. - Okay. Enjoy.

1580
00:57:24,191 --> 00:57:25,460
- Thank you. - Happy New Year.

1581
00:57:25,461 --> 00:57:26,561
Happy New Year.

1582
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:28,490
He was here at the right moment.

1583
00:57:29,361 --> 00:57:32,260
(In the meantime, tasty hotteok is getting cooked.)

1584
00:57:32,501 --> 00:57:34,369
It's written here when it started.

1585
00:57:34,370 --> 00:57:36,130
Have you been running this place since 1994?

1586
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:38,546
- I was born in 1996. - It's been almost 30 years.

1587
00:57:38,570 --> 00:57:40,851
- It's been 31 years. - I started in front of the J Bank.

1588
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:42,671
Do you know Towner?

1589
00:57:43,311 --> 00:57:44,440
A small truck.

1590
00:57:44,441 --> 00:57:45,710
- Pardon? - Cha Eun Woo?

1591
00:57:45,711 --> 00:57:47,480
- Towner. - Towner.

1592
00:57:47,481 --> 00:57:48,710
- Towner. - It's a truck.

1593
00:57:48,711 --> 00:57:50,009
- It's an old one. - Right.

1594
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:51,449
Right. The towner truck in the past.

1595
00:57:51,450 --> 00:57:52,779
It's been discontinued.

1596
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:53,889
- Right. - Yes.

1597
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:55,489
I ran my business in it for a few years.

1598
00:57:55,490 --> 00:57:57,190
Then you moved to a shop.

1599
00:57:57,191 --> 00:57:58,389
I've come to this place.

1600
00:57:58,390 --> 00:57:59,560
(Started in a small truck, she's moved to a restaurant.)

1601
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:01,001
You must have made a lot of money...

1602
00:58:01,331 --> 00:58:02,790
back then to move here.

1603
00:58:02,791 --> 00:58:04,130
I made so much money.

1604
00:58:04,131 --> 00:58:05,500
(Cracking up)

1605
00:58:05,501 --> 00:58:06,960
You started your business in a truck.

1606
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:08,130
- Wait. - Get the tongs...

1607
00:58:08,131 --> 00:58:09,170
- and take them. - I'll hold it.

1608
00:58:09,171 --> 00:58:10,299
- Thank you. - We'll take it.

1609
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,469
- Do we get a set of tongs each? - Yes.

1610
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,441
(They'll try the super tasty hotteok.)

1611
00:58:14,311 --> 00:58:15,540
(I say, "Ho")

1612
00:58:15,541 --> 00:58:16,909
(You say, "Tteok")

1613
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:19,080
(Hotteok)

1614
00:58:19,081 --> 00:58:20,339
(Hotteok in my hand)

1615
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:21,651
(Hotteok is sweet)

1616
00:58:24,550 --> 00:58:26,679
(Dripping with honey, sweetness overload)

1617
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:28,450
(Crunchy and chewy)

1618
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:32,460
(Hotteok beloved by Team Handsome)

1619
00:58:32,461 --> 00:58:33,461
(Give me hotteok)

1620
00:58:35,490 --> 00:58:36,730
(Handsome Bakery Tour 3: Hotteok of a lifetime)

1621
00:58:36,731 --> 00:58:38,136
(Crunchy outside, filled with honey inside)

1622
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:41,130
(Shall we try Gimje's hotteok?)

1623
00:58:41,131 --> 00:58:43,199
We'll grab tongs.

1624
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:44,299
Okay. Thank you.

1625
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:46,541
- I'm happy. - Gosh. Grab it with the tongs.

1626
00:58:46,771 --> 00:58:47,941
Thanks for the food.

1627
00:58:48,111 --> 00:58:49,340
Let's grab one and try it.

1628
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:51,580
- Hotteok. - When you eat it,

1629
00:58:51,581 --> 00:58:53,310
- fold it in half. - Should we fold it?

1630
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:55,080
- Yes. Like that. - We fold it in half.

1631
00:58:55,081 --> 00:58:57,820
(They fold it in half as the owner suggested.)

1632
00:58:58,021 --> 00:59:00,081
- Cheers. - It smells amazing already.

1633
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:01,351
Thank you for the food.

1634
00:59:01,791 --> 00:59:04,490
- Thank you. - Yes. Please enjoy.

1635
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:09,331
Hold on. I can't eat it because it'll be hot.

1636
00:59:10,291 --> 00:59:11,331
Thank you.

1637
00:59:11,601 --> 00:59:16,370
(The older brothers take a bite even though it's hot.)

1638
00:59:17,240 --> 00:59:18,600
(Happy)

1639
00:59:18,601 --> 00:59:19,601
Thank you.

1640
00:59:19,602 --> 00:59:21,910
(Crunchy)

1641
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:26,481
(They keep getting amazed with happiness.)

1642
00:59:27,651 --> 00:59:30,620
(Sang Uk goes for the sugar in the center first.)

1643
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:35,050
(Eye-opening)

1644
00:59:35,351 --> 00:59:36,390
It's so good.

1645
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:38,460
- This is... - When I think of it... Yes.

1646
00:59:38,461 --> 00:59:40,489
First of all, it's not oily.

1647
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:42,590
She grilled it so well. It's crunchy.

1648
00:59:43,331 --> 00:59:44,561
It's not greasy.

1649
00:59:44,930 --> 00:59:47,001
When we have hotteok, do you know that?

1650
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:48,830
It has that flour taste.

1651
00:59:48,831 --> 00:59:50,351
- This one doesn't have that. - Right.

1652
00:59:50,541 --> 00:59:51,601
- You're right? - Right?

1653
00:59:51,771 --> 00:59:53,851
When we eat hotteok, it always has that flour taste.

1654
00:59:54,041 --> 00:59:55,110
But this one doesn't have it.

1655
00:59:55,111 --> 00:59:56,569
(Instead of the flour taste, it's filled with sweetness.)

1656
00:59:56,570 --> 00:59:59,541
Also, the dough is thin.

1657
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:01,611
- You're right. - That's the technique.

1658
01:00:02,010 --> 01:00:03,150
Is this the technique?

1659
01:00:03,151 --> 01:00:04,151
Yes.

1660
01:00:04,152 --> 01:00:06,881
Rather than honey, I can taste brown sugar...

1661
01:00:07,820 --> 01:00:09,320
and nuts from time to time.

1662
01:00:09,651 --> 01:00:11,659
- Yes. Do you smell the cinnamon? - Yes.

1663
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:13,460
I like how subtle the cinnamon is.

1664
01:00:13,461 --> 01:00:14,461
It's subtle.

1665
01:00:14,462 --> 01:00:16,542
- If it was strong, I'd not like it. - That's right.

1666
01:00:17,861 --> 01:00:20,299
I could understand how you came to this place...

1667
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:22,231
after starting from a truck.

1668
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:24,441
If it's been 31 years selling hotteok...

1669
01:00:25,041 --> 01:00:26,240
What?

1670
01:00:26,401 --> 01:00:27,946
Have you been selling it since you were ten years old?

1671
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:29,311
- I was young. - Come on.

1672
01:00:29,611 --> 01:00:31,251
Were you ten when you started selling it?

1673
01:00:32,410 --> 01:00:33,410
Gosh.

1674
01:00:33,950 --> 01:00:35,751
I've devoted my youth to it.

1675
01:00:36,481 --> 01:00:39,021
You got me. If it's been 30 years...

1676
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:40,989
How could you do it when you were ten?

1677
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:42,150
- It's hotteok filled with tears. - Gosh.

1678
01:00:42,151 --> 01:00:43,566
(How could you have done it since you were 10?)

1679
01:00:43,590 --> 01:00:45,060
The thin part is so good.

1680
01:00:45,061 --> 01:00:46,159
- I fold it in half, - The part with honey.

1681
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:47,331
But it's still this thin.

1682
01:00:47,490 --> 01:00:49,259
- It's crazy. - It's crunchy outside. It's...

1683
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:50,260
This part is so tasty.

1684
01:00:50,261 --> 01:00:53,230
I've been to many places, including the marketplace in Busan,

1685
01:00:53,231 --> 01:00:54,429
because I'm a big fan of hotteok.

1686
01:00:54,430 --> 01:00:55,430
(John Park is a hotteok lover.)

1687
01:00:55,431 --> 01:00:56,799
- It's hotteok of my life. - Really?

1688
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,640
I admit it. It's the best, ma'am.

1689
01:00:59,101 --> 01:01:00,640
- Thank you. - Of the hotteok I had...

1690
01:01:00,811 --> 01:01:02,140
How do you get the ingredients?

1691
01:01:02,771 --> 01:01:04,380
As for the ingredients,

1692
01:01:04,381 --> 01:01:06,009
I get the Horizon Rice that was cultivated here in Gimje.

1693
01:01:06,010 --> 01:01:07,350
I use its glutinous rice powder.

1694
01:01:07,351 --> 01:01:08,480
(The key ingredient is glutinous rice powder.)

1695
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:09,679
- It's the rice powder. - With that,

1696
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:11,980
I mix it with flour for the dough.

1697
01:01:11,981 --> 01:01:13,021
I see.

1698
01:01:13,550 --> 01:01:14,619
- I see. - On our way here,

1699
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:16,291
we said Gimje was famous for its rice.

1700
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:17,860
- The Horizon Rice. - I see.

1701
01:01:17,861 --> 01:01:19,759
They also host the Gimje Horizon Festival.

1702
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:20,861
- Really? - Yes.

1703
01:01:21,631 --> 01:01:24,260
Gosh. Don't you know about the famous Gimje Horizon Festival?

1704
01:01:25,831 --> 01:01:28,001
Sorry. We didn't know about it.

1705
01:01:28,171 --> 01:01:29,600
Do you cultivate the rice yourself?

1706
01:01:29,601 --> 01:01:30,699
Yes, I do.

1707
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,370
- Really? - I do rice farming.

1708
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,441
I also sell tteokbokki here.

1709
01:01:34,671 --> 01:01:37,239
- I use glutinous rice for hotteok. - It must be rice tteok.

1710
01:01:37,240 --> 01:01:38,986
I use the non-glutinous rice for tteokbokki.

1711
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:40,450
We'll get one serving of tteokbokki.

1712
01:01:40,541 --> 01:01:41,750
(Out of the blue?)

1713
01:01:41,751 --> 01:01:43,381
Wait. We have to try it now.

1714
01:01:44,421 --> 01:01:46,580
- You grow rice yourself... - Yes.

1715
01:01:46,581 --> 01:01:48,250
- to make tteokbokki. - I do everything.

1716
01:01:48,251 --> 01:01:49,319
We'll get one of it.

1717
01:01:49,320 --> 01:01:50,659
(Just do it.)

1718
01:01:50,660 --> 01:01:51,920
- You don't have it? - Can you eat it, though?

1719
01:01:51,921 --> 01:01:52,990
Yes, we can.

1720
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,989
(They casually add tteokbokki to their order.)

1721
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:56,830
- Thank you. - It's made with the Horizon Rice.

1722
01:01:56,831 --> 01:01:58,300
- Yes. We'll enjoy it. - Thank you.

1723
01:01:58,430 --> 01:01:59,430
- Gosh. - It smells amazing.

1724
01:01:59,431 --> 01:02:00,900
I serve 5 pieces of tteok for 1 serving.

1725
01:02:00,901 --> 01:02:02,131
But I forgot to put one.

1726
01:02:02,631 --> 01:02:04,671
- Why? - You might be full.

1727
01:02:06,370 --> 01:02:08,611
- I can finish it. - She's thinking of us.

1728
01:02:08,711 --> 01:02:09,739
- Thank you. - She's thinking of us.

1729
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:10,740
We appreciate it.

1730
01:02:10,741 --> 01:02:13,140
- We have to eat more later. - Yes?

1731
01:02:14,510 --> 01:02:15,850
(Surprised)

1732
01:02:15,851 --> 01:02:16,851
Hey.

1733
01:02:17,851 --> 01:02:19,131
One bite will already shock you.

1734
01:02:20,021 --> 01:02:21,701
Gosh. It tastes like home-made tteokbokki.

1735
01:02:23,021 --> 01:02:25,236
You can't find tteokbokki like that in Seoul, so enjoy it.

1736
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:26,740
It felt like marshmallow in my mouth.

1737
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,236
- It's the tteok made of rice. - What was that?

1738
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,460
The texture in your mouth...

1739
01:02:29,461 --> 01:02:30,929
It's made of rice.

1740
01:02:30,930 --> 01:02:31,930
It's chewy.

1741
01:02:33,430 --> 01:02:34,569
The texture is incredible.

1742
01:02:34,570 --> 01:02:37,901
(Sang Uk is also highly satisfied.)

1743
01:02:38,441 --> 01:02:40,401
The food is tasty,

1744
01:02:40,771 --> 01:02:43,110
and the owner has incredible energy.

1745
01:02:43,111 --> 01:02:44,239
She has love.

1746
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:46,380
- Your energy... - Thank you.

1747
01:02:46,381 --> 01:02:48,980
- draws people in. - That's right.

1748
01:02:48,981 --> 01:02:51,021
Gosh, you have a good eye.

1749
01:02:53,581 --> 01:02:55,020
Seriously.

1750
01:02:55,021 --> 01:02:56,420
(She's cute until the end.)

1751
01:02:56,421 --> 01:02:57,520
She's full of energy.

1752
01:02:57,521 --> 01:02:59,290
In Gimje,

1753
01:02:59,291 --> 01:03:01,830
we really enjoyed hotteok...

1754
01:03:01,831 --> 01:03:04,130
- by the energetic owner. - Thank you.

1755
01:03:04,131 --> 01:03:05,660
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1756
01:03:07,131 --> 01:03:09,469
- Shall we move on to the quiz? - Shall we?

1757
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:10,740
(Time for Quiz)

1758
01:03:11,140 --> 01:03:12,840
Here comes the quiz.

1759
01:03:14,970 --> 01:03:16,541
"Ho" from hotteok...

1760
01:03:17,271 --> 01:03:19,509
(We know this!)

1761
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:22,450
(John looked it up on their way here.)

1762
01:03:22,751 --> 01:03:24,581
means "Barbarian."

1763
01:03:25,251 --> 01:03:27,820
So hotteok means "Rice cake from China."

1764
01:03:28,921 --> 01:03:30,291
- We know that. - Yes.

1765
01:03:30,521 --> 01:03:32,159
We talked about it in the car.

1766
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,219
(We studied it on our way here!)

1767
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:34,361
Among the following,

1768
01:03:35,831 --> 01:03:38,330
which word doesn't contain "Ho,"

1769
01:03:38,331 --> 01:03:40,200
the character for "Barbarian?"

1770
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:41,731
This is it.

1771
01:03:42,101 --> 01:03:43,621
You saw a few examples earlier, right?

1772
01:03:43,831 --> 01:03:45,140
Only a few.

1773
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,570
It's a multiple-choice question.

1774
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:47,740
Number one,

1775
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:49,740
hodu or walnut.

1776
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:53,081
Number two, homi or hand hoe.

1777
01:03:55,050 --> 01:03:56,279
- Number three, - Hand hoe?

1778
01:03:56,280 --> 01:03:57,481
Hobak or pumpkin.

1779
01:03:58,381 --> 01:04:00,320
Number four, hojumeoni or pocket.

1780
01:04:02,421 --> 01:04:04,141
The one that doesn't contain the character.

1781
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:06,921
We need to take out walnut.

1782
01:04:07,320 --> 01:04:09,860
I think it means "A barbarian's head."

1783
01:04:09,861 --> 01:04:10,861
("Ho" for "Barbarian" and "Du" for "Head")

1784
01:04:10,862 --> 01:04:13,029
- "A barbarian's head?" - "Du" for "Head."

1785
01:04:13,030 --> 01:04:14,370
You know, "Du" is...

1786
01:04:14,631 --> 01:04:17,199
- Seriously, walnut... - It looks like a brain.

1787
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,469
Looks like a brain when you open it.

1788
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:20,569
A brain.

1789
01:04:20,570 --> 01:04:21,740
Thus,

1790
01:04:22,570 --> 01:04:25,510
I think it contains the character. I think pumpkin also contains it.

1791
01:04:25,941 --> 01:04:27,580
- I'm certain. - Your name sounds similar.

1792
01:04:27,581 --> 01:04:28,610
Yes.

1793
01:04:28,611 --> 01:04:30,779
- Hobak or pumpkin. - It isn't pumpkin.

1794
01:04:30,780 --> 01:04:31,949
- Pumpkin... - Only John Park...

1795
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:33,450
can be a Park.

1796
01:04:34,050 --> 01:04:36,220
- Your name sounds similar. - There can't be pumpkin.

1797
01:04:36,791 --> 01:04:37,791
It isn't pumpkin.

1798
01:04:38,191 --> 01:04:40,260
It must be either pocket or hand hoe.

1799
01:04:40,421 --> 01:04:42,990
- To be honest, I have information. - What is it?

1800
01:04:43,291 --> 01:04:44,800
I read an article about how...

1801
01:04:45,101 --> 01:04:47,160
homi or hand hoe was exported overseas.

1802
01:04:47,771 --> 01:04:50,271
Had the word contained that character,

1803
01:04:51,441 --> 01:04:55,069
a different word would've been used at this point.

1804
01:04:55,070 --> 01:04:56,170
(Wouldn't the name have been changed?)

1805
01:04:56,171 --> 01:04:57,510
Maybe.

1806
01:04:57,541 --> 01:04:59,739
(Doesn't "Ho" from homi or hand hoe mean "Barbarian?")

1807
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:01,820
Back in the day, Korean clothes didn't have pockets.

1808
01:05:02,151 --> 01:05:04,521
Seeing the foreigners' clothes might've changed that.

1809
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,080
Old Korean clothes didn't have pockets.

1810
01:05:06,081 --> 01:05:07,081
- It's plausible. - Is that so?

1811
01:05:07,082 --> 01:05:08,466
- It's plausible. - As far as I know, yes.

1812
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:09,751
I think it's hand hoe.

1813
01:05:10,521 --> 01:05:11,720
- Hand hoe. - Yes.

1814
01:05:12,490 --> 01:05:13,990
I suddenly think it's walnut.

1815
01:05:14,291 --> 01:05:16,290
(He suddenly chooses walnut.)

1816
01:05:16,291 --> 01:05:17,861
Things go like this.

1817
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:19,100
Listen.

1818
01:05:19,101 --> 01:05:21,630
- You said that it wasn't walnut. - John.

1819
01:05:21,631 --> 01:05:23,929
- You said that first. - I just remembered something.

1820
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:26,271
Walnut immediately sounds like a wrong answer, right?

1821
01:05:26,700 --> 01:05:28,970
It must be a trap.

1822
01:05:29,711 --> 01:05:32,111
Do you see why Sang Uk got the penalty three weeks in a row?

1823
01:05:32,910 --> 01:05:34,040
(My head hurts.)

1824
01:05:34,041 --> 01:05:35,280
Think about it.

1825
01:05:35,851 --> 01:05:36,851
Hey.

1826
01:05:36,852 --> 01:05:38,680
(Did Yi Kyung notice something?)

1827
01:05:39,021 --> 01:05:40,251
- I made deductions. - Okay.

1828
01:05:41,090 --> 01:05:42,521
- Hotteok. - Yes.

1829
01:05:42,851 --> 01:05:44,791
If we take out "Ho," one word remains.

1830
01:05:44,861 --> 01:05:46,561
- "Tteok" can stand on its own. - Yes.

1831
01:05:47,061 --> 01:05:49,030
- "Bak" can stand on its own. - Yes.

1832
01:05:49,061 --> 01:05:51,130
- "Jumeoni" can stand on its own. - Yes, it can.

1833
01:05:51,131 --> 01:05:52,491
So it's either walnut or hand hoe.

1834
01:05:52,760 --> 01:05:54,600
- It's a good strategy. - Right?

1835
01:05:54,601 --> 01:05:55,799
- "Ho" should be an addition... - That's right.

1836
01:05:55,800 --> 01:05:57,270
- to an existing word. - That's right.

1837
01:05:57,271 --> 01:05:59,369
That's right. "Ho" was added...

1838
01:05:59,370 --> 01:06:01,110
to a pre-existing word to denote a similar item...

1839
01:06:01,111 --> 01:06:02,540
- that was from China. - That's right.

1840
01:06:02,541 --> 01:06:05,040
- Pocket, pumpkin, and hotteok - That's right.

1841
01:06:05,041 --> 01:06:06,910
- So what are "Mi" and "Du?" - I don't know.

1842
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:10,150
(Don't you know that?)

1843
01:06:10,151 --> 01:06:11,280
Can "Du" mean...

1844
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:14,049
something like "Nut?"

1845
01:06:14,050 --> 01:06:15,050
Nuts.

1846
01:06:15,051 --> 01:06:16,520
- No. - We don't use "Du."

1847
01:06:16,521 --> 01:06:17,889
- You don't use "Du." - No.

1848
01:06:17,890 --> 01:06:18,990
- Nuts. - How about "Mi?"

1849
01:06:19,021 --> 01:06:20,560
Hand hoe is for digging.

1850
01:06:20,561 --> 01:06:24,461
"Mi" could mean "Flavour."

1851
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,600
Two options remain.

1852
01:06:26,601 --> 01:06:28,201
- It's 1 of the 2. - It's 1 of the 2.

1853
01:06:28,830 --> 01:06:31,499
These are the options the two you picked.

1854
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:32,639
- That's right. - One each.

1855
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:33,870
- I think it's walnut. - Play rock-paper-scissors.

1856
01:06:33,871 --> 01:06:35,040
I think it's walnut.

1857
01:06:35,571 --> 01:06:37,741
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Judging by the past...

1858
01:06:38,140 --> 01:06:40,020
I'll be upset if I lose in rock-paper-scissors.

1859
01:06:40,311 --> 01:06:42,510
Pick hand hoe then.

1860
01:06:42,781 --> 01:06:45,150
- If it's wrong... - I'll go with your choice next.

1861
01:06:45,151 --> 01:06:46,749
- Okay. - Hand hoe.

1862
01:06:46,750 --> 01:06:48,219
- Shall we trust him? - Which one?

1863
01:06:48,220 --> 01:06:49,549
- He read an article. - I...

1864
01:06:49,550 --> 01:06:51,590
- He read an article. - It's your intuition, right?

1865
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:53,390
- It's my intuition. - It's...

1866
01:06:53,691 --> 01:06:57,260
the animalistic intuition of the world's number one fencer.

1867
01:06:57,661 --> 01:07:00,300
It's your intuition versus my knowledge that's based on...

1868
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,629
- something I've seen. - It's my intuition.

1869
01:07:02,630 --> 01:07:04,339
You should pick one then.

1870
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:05,976
Since it's 1 to 1, you should take a pick.

1871
01:07:06,000 --> 01:07:07,839
Why are you putting that burden on me?

1872
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:09,039
No.

1873
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,271
We'll follow your decision.

1874
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:13,410
Which one do you think makes...

1875
01:07:13,411 --> 01:07:14,850
more sense?

1876
01:07:14,851 --> 01:07:15,910
I think...

1877
01:07:15,911 --> 01:07:17,379
(What's John's verdict?)

1878
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:20,521
Yi Kyung promoted his answer much more diligently,

1879
01:07:21,151 --> 01:07:22,950
so I think we should go with that.

1880
01:07:22,951 --> 01:07:24,249
- Hand hoe. - He'll regret it...

1881
01:07:24,250 --> 01:07:26,719
if he picks walnut and it turns out to be incorrect.

1882
01:07:26,720 --> 01:07:28,530
- So let's go with hand hoe. - Let's use a hint if we must.

1883
01:07:28,531 --> 01:07:30,259
- Okay. - Let's shout it out together.

1884
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:31,459
- Okay. - Okay.

1885
01:07:31,460 --> 01:07:33,530
Let us answer. One, two, three.

1886
01:07:33,531 --> 01:07:34,600
- Hand hoe. - Hand hoe.

1887
01:07:34,601 --> 01:07:38,669
(Hand hoe)

1888
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:39,741
Correct.

1889
01:07:40,601 --> 01:07:41,611
Correct.

1890
01:07:42,441 --> 01:07:45,281
Hey, you punk!

1891
01:07:46,481 --> 01:07:47,579
You punk!

1892
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:48,950
- Lee Yi Kyung! - You punk!

1893
01:07:48,951 --> 01:07:50,209
You punk!

1894
01:07:50,210 --> 01:07:51,879
- Well done. - I trusted you.

1895
01:07:51,880 --> 01:07:53,520
- Of course. - I trusted you.

1896
01:07:53,521 --> 01:07:54,920
(Yi Kyung, I trusted you.)

1897
01:07:55,351 --> 01:07:58,290
Walnut means "A barbarian's head," right?

1898
01:07:58,561 --> 01:08:01,429
"Du" comes from "Do," a character that means "Peach."

1899
01:08:01,430 --> 01:08:02,490
(Barbarian peach)

1900
01:08:02,491 --> 01:08:04,701
- So it used to be "Hodo." - Like peach.

1901
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,401
"Hodo" became "Hodu."

1902
01:08:07,430 --> 01:08:08,669
It probably got its name...

1903
01:08:08,670 --> 01:08:10,770
because it looked like a peach.

1904
01:08:10,771 --> 01:08:12,639
Homi or hand hoe is pure Korean.

1905
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:14,071
- Pure Korean. - See?

1906
01:08:14,271 --> 01:08:15,571
You're a punk like a walnut!

1907
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:17,910
For goodness' sake.

1908
01:08:17,911 --> 01:08:19,240
Would you like a walnut?

1909
01:08:19,241 --> 01:08:20,781
You can see why I'm like this, right?

1910
01:08:21,210 --> 01:08:23,510
- Still, we did it. - We didn't use a hint.

1911
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:25,351
- We had a good result. - Here.

1912
01:08:26,521 --> 01:08:28,350
- Gimje. - Gimje.

1913
01:08:28,351 --> 01:08:29,451
Hand hoe.

1914
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:31,060
Walnut.

1915
01:08:31,061 --> 01:08:35,429
(Gimje: Hotteok)

1916
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:37,861
We got hotteok in Gimje. What's the food item?

1917
01:08:38,901 --> 01:08:41,799
We can eat it here! Fishcake!

1918
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:43,329
It's one thing we didn't eat.

1919
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:44,640
It's one thing we didn't eat.

1920
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:47,540
(Gimje: Fishcake)

1921
01:08:48,371 --> 01:08:52,111
(The best snack with soup, fishcake)

1922
01:08:53,481 --> 01:08:56,210
It used to cost 20 cents in front of my place.

1923
01:08:56,411 --> 01:08:57,680
It was a long time ago.

1924
01:08:58,281 --> 01:08:59,850
I used to take taekwondo classes.

1925
01:08:59,851 --> 01:09:01,690
(A big bite)

1926
01:09:01,691 --> 01:09:02,920
Didn't the other team finish?

1927
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:04,350
- No. - Not yet.

1928
01:09:04,351 --> 01:09:06,260
- Where did they go to? - Ma'am,

1929
01:09:06,491 --> 01:09:09,061
does squid go into fishcake?

1930
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:12,030
When fortunate people eat fishcake, they taste squid as well.

1931
01:09:12,031 --> 01:09:13,101
(So it depends.)

1932
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:15,329
It depends.

1933
01:09:15,330 --> 01:09:16,630
That's right.

1934
01:09:16,771 --> 01:09:19,170
Sometimes, fishcake is tasty. Sometimes, it isn't.

1935
01:09:19,241 --> 01:09:20,770
I can't believe fishcake is sold here.

1936
01:09:20,771 --> 01:09:22,440
- Fishcake is tasty too. - Seriously.

1937
01:09:22,441 --> 01:09:24,201
(They clear the mission by eating fishcake.)

1938
01:09:24,241 --> 01:09:25,780
Where should we go to? Gunsan?

1939
01:09:25,781 --> 01:09:26,781
(Team Handsome can go to the next location right away.)

1940
01:09:26,782 --> 01:09:28,650
- Firstly... - Gunsan.

1941
01:09:28,651 --> 01:09:29,911
Since we got these squares...

1942
01:09:30,611 --> 01:09:32,451
Let's take Gunsan. It's close from here.

1943
01:09:32,750 --> 01:09:33,750
Twenty-five minutes.

1944
01:09:33,951 --> 01:09:35,919
- Okay. - We have a reattempt card.

1945
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,351
If we get the Gunsan square,

1946
01:09:37,491 --> 01:09:39,821
we just need to complete 1 of the 2 for a bingo.

1947
01:09:40,121 --> 01:09:41,660
- Also, - The moment it rings...

1948
01:09:41,661 --> 01:09:43,289
we have two unused reattempt cards.

1949
01:09:43,290 --> 01:09:45,259
- That's right. - Yes.

1950
01:09:45,260 --> 01:09:47,430
Can we trust Sang Uk's words now?

1951
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,601
Let's see.

1952
01:09:51,340 --> 01:09:54,510
- Things are going as we planned. - We'll go to Gunsan.

1953
01:09:54,741 --> 01:09:56,639
- Let's get off work fast. - Thank you for the food.

1954
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,539
- Thank you. - All right. Good luck.

1955
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:00,379
- Okay. Have a good day. - Bye.

1956
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:02,680
- Bless you. - I hope you become more successful.

1957
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:04,210
It's perfect.

1958
01:10:04,720 --> 01:10:06,121
Good.

1959
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:08,191
I can't believe our luck.

1960
01:10:09,521 --> 01:10:11,219
We need to go to Gunsan.

1961
01:10:11,220 --> 01:10:12,866
(Gimje residents recognize Team Handsome.)

1962
01:10:12,890 --> 01:10:15,459
(Thank you, Gimje.)

1963
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:17,830
(Sang Uk bows as well.)

1964
01:10:18,460 --> 01:10:22,531
(They leave Gimje and drive to Gunsan.)

1965
01:10:22,601 --> 01:10:25,640
(Team Guys)

1966
01:10:26,170 --> 01:10:27,270
(Gunsan, Gimje)

1967
01:10:27,271 --> 01:10:30,771
(They just enter Gimje.)

1968
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:32,040
(Cuckoo)

1969
01:10:32,041 --> 01:10:33,179
Already?

1970
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:35,050
- Gimje! - Gimje?

1971
01:10:36,351 --> 01:10:37,431
Where should we go to then?

1972
01:10:37,821 --> 01:10:39,719
(Nothing is going well for Team Guys today.)

1973
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:40,850
What happened?

1974
01:10:40,851 --> 01:10:41,990
I think we should stop.

1975
01:10:41,991 --> 01:10:43,311
(They stop the car for a moment.)

1976
01:10:43,491 --> 01:10:45,090
If they took the Gimje square...

1977
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,329
- I think they did it to block us. - Right?

1978
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:50,960
Then we have no reason to go to Imsil.

1979
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:53,329
- It won't be the best choice. - That's what I think.

1980
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:56,330
So why don't we go to Jeonju?

1981
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:57,900
What do you think?

1982
01:10:57,901 --> 01:10:59,740
If we go down after visiting Jeonju,

1983
01:10:59,741 --> 01:11:00,999
we might only visit two places.

1984
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:02,240
But if we go down right away,

1985
01:11:02,241 --> 01:11:05,116
we'll be able to visit three places even if we don't get the quiz right.

1986
01:11:05,140 --> 01:11:07,910
Hyuk, you have a good hunch. Please decide.

1987
01:11:07,911 --> 01:11:08,980
(It's between going to Jeonju or Buan and Jeongeup.)

1988
01:11:08,981 --> 01:11:11,049
I think it'll be better to go to Buan.

1989
01:11:11,050 --> 01:11:13,420
If we block Buan A or B...

1990
01:11:13,521 --> 01:11:15,820
- They took these squares. - That's right.

1991
01:11:15,821 --> 01:11:17,990
So we can go there and stop them from completing a bingo.

1992
01:11:17,991 --> 01:11:20,420
Or we can go to Buan A and B and Jeongeup.

1993
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:21,730
We'll get two squares at the very least.

1994
01:11:21,731 --> 01:11:22,731
That's right.

1995
01:11:22,732 --> 01:11:26,259
They might go to Gunsan thinking, "Why didn't they go there?"

1996
01:11:26,260 --> 01:11:27,401
They might go to Gunsan.

1997
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:30,070
- Shall we go to Buan B? - B.

1998
01:11:30,071 --> 01:11:31,600
Let's see how it goes and go left or right from there.

1999
01:11:31,601 --> 01:11:33,940
- That's right. - Either side.

2000
01:11:33,941 --> 01:11:36,311
- Bakery. - Bakery.

2001
01:11:37,441 --> 01:11:38,780
- Let's hit the road. - okay.

2002
01:11:38,781 --> 01:11:41,250
(Team Guys heads to Buan to attempt turning the tables.)

2003
01:11:41,351 --> 01:11:43,311
(Team Handsome)

2004
01:11:43,451 --> 01:11:44,749
(Team Handsome is heading to Gunsan as Team Guys wants.)

2005
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,220
Today, it's like...

2006
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,590
What is the other team doing?

2007
01:11:49,951 --> 01:11:51,959
We didn't hear a cuckoo in a long while.

2008
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:53,337
(Why didn't we hear a cuckoo in a long while?)

2009
01:11:53,361 --> 01:11:54,960
It has been a while.

2010
01:11:55,031 --> 01:11:56,959
Seriously. It's either they failed to get the quiz right...

2011
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,299
or they're in Imsil.

2012
01:11:58,300 --> 01:11:59,429
- That's the only explanation. - Yes.

2013
01:11:59,430 --> 01:12:01,669
Perhaps they went far to take the center square.

2014
01:12:01,670 --> 01:12:03,731
You know that I haven't won once, right?

2015
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:07,101
Today is the day.

2016
01:12:07,140 --> 01:12:09,040
- Today is the day. - I lost every single time.

2017
01:12:09,170 --> 01:12:11,640
(Gosh, Sang Uk!)

2018
01:12:11,811 --> 01:12:13,640
I can win now, right?

2019
01:12:14,951 --> 01:12:17,049
- Us? - Me.

2020
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:18,879
- We'll win if you don't insist. - We...

2021
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:20,180
If I don't insist?

2022
01:12:20,750 --> 01:12:23,451
- It's because of my name. - We'll win if you don't do that.

2023
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:25,259
Let's graduate.

2024
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:26,260
(Will he graduate the title of the man with zero wins?)

2025
01:12:26,261 --> 01:12:28,731
I've done the penalty three times. It's enough.

2026
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:31,161
I hope the other team withdraws...

2027
01:12:31,191 --> 01:12:32,829
for the first time in history.

2028
01:12:32,830 --> 01:12:34,499
(I hope the other team withdraws. for the first time in history.)

2029
01:12:34,500 --> 01:12:36,970
Imagine them having 1 square when we have 4 squares.

2030
01:12:37,571 --> 01:12:39,200
Modern Girl was the last one.

2031
01:12:39,201 --> 01:12:41,201
"We withdraw."

2032
01:12:41,340 --> 01:12:43,639
- Modern Girl was the last one. - Modern Girl was the last one.

2033
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,879
(Will the game end as Team Handsome's victory?)

2034
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:47,981
(Gunsan)

2035
01:12:48,111 --> 01:12:50,050
We began at the Gunsan Station...

2036
01:12:50,451 --> 01:12:51,650
and came back to Gunsan.

2037
01:12:51,651 --> 01:12:54,021
You usually feel bad in such cases, right?

2038
01:12:55,121 --> 01:12:57,590
I feel like we're returning home in glory.

2039
01:12:57,720 --> 01:13:02,561
(They get close to the destination under the clear sky.)

2040
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:05,360
The clouds move so fast in the clear sky.

2041
01:13:05,361 --> 01:13:06,806
(The clouds move so fast in the clear sky.)

2042
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:07,900
They're like us.

2043
01:13:07,901 --> 01:13:09,169
(They're like us.)

2044
01:13:09,170 --> 01:13:10,429
The clouds are moving so fast.

2045
01:13:10,430 --> 01:13:12,169
The tempo is fast.

2046
01:13:12,170 --> 01:13:13,701
- Are we here? - Yes.

2047
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:15,339
We're here.

2048
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:17,770
(Gunsan)

2049
01:13:17,771 --> 01:13:18,911
Let's go.

2050
01:13:18,941 --> 01:13:20,209
For some reason...

2051
01:13:20,210 --> 01:13:21,611
Why do I feel so relaxed?

2052
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:23,810
I haven't felt this relaxed during my time on the show.

2053
01:13:23,811 --> 01:13:25,179
- Really? - John, you came at the right time.

2054
01:13:25,180 --> 01:13:28,121
I just feel like I'm touring bakeries.

2055
01:13:28,191 --> 01:13:29,451
It's so much fun.

2056
01:13:30,191 --> 01:13:31,520
(Gunsan: castella)

2057
01:13:31,521 --> 01:13:33,719
What kind of bread exists here?

2058
01:13:33,720 --> 01:13:36,061
They sell rice castella.

2059
01:13:36,390 --> 01:13:37,830
Rice castella?

2060
01:13:38,201 --> 01:13:39,201
(Will Team Handsome be able to take over Gunsan?)

2061
01:13:39,202 --> 01:13:40,329
How is a bakery so big?

2062
01:13:40,330 --> 01:13:41,799
Hello.

2063
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:44,201
(Will Team Handsome be able to take over Gunsan?)

2064
01:13:45,201 --> 01:13:47,241
We should get rice castella, right?

2065
01:13:48,470 --> 01:13:49,540
Is that it?

2066
01:13:50,071 --> 01:13:51,240
It says, "Bakery tour."

2067
01:13:51,241 --> 01:13:53,880
- "Rice flour bakery tour." - I see.

2068
01:13:54,441 --> 01:13:55,810
- This is it. - This is it.

2069
01:13:55,811 --> 01:13:57,410
- Rice flour. - Rice castella.

2070
01:13:57,411 --> 01:13:58,621
This is it.

2071
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,450
What was your daughter's name? So Yun?

2072
01:14:00,451 --> 01:14:02,490
- Seo Hyun. - Seo Hyun.

2073
01:14:02,491 --> 01:14:04,120
This one is for Seo Hyun.

2074
01:14:04,121 --> 01:14:05,321
Thank you.

2075
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:08,429
- We'll get these ones. - I'll ring you up.

2076
01:14:08,430 --> 01:14:09,630
Hello.

2077
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,429
- Hello. - Hello.

2078
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:13,429
- Hello. - There are freshly made ones.

2079
01:14:13,430 --> 01:14:14,901
I'll switch yours to these ones.

2080
01:14:15,430 --> 01:14:17,630
- They're freshly made. - They look tasty.

2081
01:14:17,731 --> 01:14:19,101
What a timing.

2082
01:14:19,170 --> 01:14:20,371
They look tasty.

2083
01:14:22,611 --> 01:14:23,611
(Touching)

2084
01:14:23,612 --> 01:14:25,509
- It's warm. - Back in the day...

2085
01:14:25,510 --> 01:14:26,740
They're freshly made.

2086
01:14:26,741 --> 01:14:28,579
It's really tasty with strawberry milk.

2087
01:14:28,580 --> 01:14:29,951
Go ahead and eat.

2088
01:14:29,981 --> 01:14:31,950
It's for your daughter, Seo Hyun.

2089
01:14:31,951 --> 01:14:33,650
Thank you, Yi Kyung.

2090
01:14:33,651 --> 01:14:35,589
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2091
01:14:35,590 --> 01:14:36,890
They just came out.

2092
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:38,460
I should ask.

2093
01:14:38,861 --> 01:14:40,191
Ma'am.

2094
01:14:41,021 --> 01:14:42,790
Was Kim Dong Hyun here?

2095
01:14:42,830 --> 01:14:44,330
- Yes, he was. - What?

2096
01:14:44,430 --> 01:14:45,901
- Was he here? - Was he here? When?

2097
01:14:46,201 --> 01:14:47,329
It has been two hours, right?

2098
01:14:47,330 --> 01:14:48,630
It has been two hours.

2099
01:14:48,830 --> 01:14:50,871
- He was here. - They went to Gunsan first.

2100
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:52,339
His face was dark when he left, right?

2101
01:14:52,340 --> 01:14:53,539
(His face was dark when he left, right?)

2102
01:14:53,540 --> 01:14:55,539
- Of course. - He was disappointed, right?

2103
01:14:55,540 --> 01:14:56,540
The alarm didn't sound.

2104
01:14:56,541 --> 01:14:58,441
Did he say where he was going?

2105
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:00,240
He didn't say where he was going.

2106
01:15:00,241 --> 01:15:01,810
He just went that way.

2107
01:15:01,811 --> 01:15:02,980
That way? I see.

2108
01:15:02,981 --> 01:15:04,579
- So he was here. - Yes.

2109
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:05,749
Okay. Thank you.

2110
01:15:05,750 --> 01:15:07,049
They visited Gunsan and Imsil,

2111
01:15:07,050 --> 01:15:08,889
- but failed to win a square. - That's right.

2112
01:15:08,890 --> 01:15:09,991
(Laughing)

2113
01:15:10,890 --> 01:15:13,259
We figured it out.

2114
01:15:13,260 --> 01:15:14,560
(Laughing)

2115
01:15:14,561 --> 01:15:16,090
They came two hours ago.

2116
01:15:16,361 --> 01:15:17,991
Let's look at the board.

2117
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:20,731
Let's make simple predictions.

2118
01:15:21,061 --> 01:15:24,170
The other team had monkfish and failed the quiz.

2119
01:15:24,731 --> 01:15:26,039
That was when they heard the alarm for Iksan.

2120
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,839
- They were in Gunsan. - Yes.

2121
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:30,771
Since we took Iksan, they headed to Gimje.

2122
01:15:30,911 --> 01:15:32,351
Then they heard the alarm for Gimje.

2123
01:15:32,680 --> 01:15:33,880
We took Gimje too.

2124
01:15:34,340 --> 01:15:36,980
So they probably went to Imsil or Buan.

2125
01:15:36,981 --> 01:15:39,120
They probably went, "This won't do."

2126
01:15:39,121 --> 01:15:41,620
(Their deductions are nearly precise.)

2127
01:15:41,621 --> 01:15:43,749
- It's so nice. Seriously. - I feel relaxed.

2128
01:15:43,750 --> 01:15:45,110
- This is incredible. - We're set.

2129
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:47,490
Let's eat the freshly-baked ones.

2130
01:15:47,491 --> 01:15:48,967
(Shall we eat castella in a relaxed way?)

2131
01:15:48,991 --> 01:15:52,031
Since it's freshly made, it goes in when you press it.

2132
01:15:52,101 --> 01:15:53,460
It's soft.

2133
01:15:54,031 --> 01:15:55,031
It smells amazing.

2134
01:15:55,032 --> 01:15:57,201
It smells different.

2135
01:15:57,901 --> 01:15:59,101
The smell is to die for.

2136
01:16:14,250 --> 01:16:16,651
- It's tasty. - I feel like I'm eating a cloud.

2137
01:16:17,521 --> 01:16:19,219
- You're right. - That's what it feels like.

2138
01:16:19,220 --> 01:16:20,389
- You're right. - It's like eating a cloud.

2139
01:16:20,390 --> 01:16:21,760
- A cotton candy. - Yes.

2140
01:16:22,090 --> 01:16:24,561
I should've eaten it with a latte.

2141
01:16:25,130 --> 01:16:26,901
I saw at the entrance...

2142
01:16:27,260 --> 01:16:29,271
that he got recognized as a master in Gunsan.

2143
01:16:29,430 --> 01:16:32,139
He received another plaque from a Korean association.

2144
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:33,339
(Patisserie and boulangerie master hand: Hong Dong Soo)

2145
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:35,209
This is a master baker's place.

2146
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:36,530
(A master baker made this bread.)

2147
01:16:36,640 --> 01:16:39,139
(At a corner of the bakery...)

2148
01:16:39,140 --> 01:16:42,380
(are various award certificates.)

2149
01:16:43,880 --> 01:16:45,480
(Who is the master baker who made the rice castella?)

2150
01:16:45,481 --> 01:16:47,280
- Did you enjoy it? - It was so tasty.

2151
01:16:47,281 --> 01:16:48,450
- It was so tasty. - Thank you.

2152
01:16:48,451 --> 01:16:49,950
Master.

2153
01:16:49,951 --> 01:16:52,219
- Hello. - Hello.

2154
01:16:52,220 --> 01:16:53,759
How...

2155
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,890
did you start making bread using rice flour?

2156
01:16:56,991 --> 01:16:58,200
In the beginning,

2157
01:16:58,201 --> 01:17:01,829
I grew up in the countryside and had an interest in the Korean crops.

2158
01:17:01,830 --> 01:17:04,329
I had a lot of love for the Korean crops.

2159
01:17:04,330 --> 01:17:09,111
I thought it'd be nice to make bread using the Korean crops.

2160
01:17:09,210 --> 01:17:11,070
That was when I met four rice.

2161
01:17:11,071 --> 01:17:12,110
Flour rice.

2162
01:17:12,111 --> 01:17:15,151
How is flour rice different from regular rice?

2163
01:17:15,580 --> 01:17:17,981
Flour rice is the name of the variety.

2164
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,820
(Flour rice)

2165
01:17:21,821 --> 01:17:25,790
(It has the taste and nutrients of regular rice.)

2166
01:17:25,920 --> 01:17:28,530
(But it has been improved for easier processing.)

2167
01:17:28,531 --> 01:17:30,459
So it isn't...

2168
01:17:30,460 --> 01:17:32,329
- It isn't blended rice. - No.

2169
01:17:32,330 --> 01:17:34,060
It's an improved variety.

2170
01:17:34,061 --> 01:17:35,669
That's why it's different.

2171
01:17:35,670 --> 01:17:38,129
So it's the best rice variety...

2172
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:40,039
- for making bread. - That's right.

2173
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:42,039
After the flour rice came out,

2174
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:45,910
I began making gluten-free products.

2175
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:47,379
- You don't make wheat flour at all. - No.

2176
01:17:47,380 --> 01:17:48,749
Is this 100-percent rice flour?

2177
01:17:48,750 --> 01:17:50,209
- That's right. - One hundred percent?

2178
01:17:50,210 --> 01:17:52,320
I met flour rice by chance.

2179
01:17:52,321 --> 01:17:54,749
I signed contracts with the farmers.

2180
01:17:54,750 --> 01:17:56,950
Then I milled and powdered the rice.

2181
01:17:56,951 --> 01:17:58,820
I used to do that.

2182
01:17:58,821 --> 01:18:01,959
That was when I began making bread with rice.

2183
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:05,259
(He studied breadmaking using the Korean rice.)

2184
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:08,129
The first successful product was castella.

2185
01:18:08,130 --> 01:18:09,969
(Rice castella became...)

2186
01:18:09,970 --> 01:18:11,901
(the most famous.)

2187
01:18:12,371 --> 01:18:16,410
(Most of other products are made with flour rice!)

2188
01:18:16,411 --> 01:18:18,310
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2189
01:18:18,311 --> 01:18:19,780
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2190
01:18:19,781 --> 01:18:21,179
Okay. Enjoy the bread.

2191
01:18:21,180 --> 01:18:23,526
(While they check out bread with love for the Korean crops)

2192
01:18:23,550 --> 01:18:25,580
We have 4.5km left to go.

2193
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:29,150
Without thinking about anything else,

2194
01:18:29,151 --> 01:18:31,890
we should go to Buan B and answer the quiz correctly.

2195
01:18:32,420 --> 01:18:33,889
Then we should take food to go.

2196
01:18:33,890 --> 01:18:35,290
(Take the mission food to go.)

2197
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:37,790
Then we should put them to sleep and go to Buan A.

2198
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:40,561
- If we do that, we won't lose. - Okay.

2199
01:18:40,830 --> 01:18:42,700
That only works if we get all the quizzes right.

2200
01:18:42,701 --> 01:18:44,530
(But they must get all the quizzes right.)

2201
01:18:44,531 --> 01:18:46,276
If we get the quiz wrong for the steamed bun square,

2202
01:18:46,300 --> 01:18:50,040
we'll have no ways to stop them from making a bingo.

2203
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,911
- That's right. - We'll need to wait.

2204
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,680
We won't be able to do anything.

2205
01:18:54,741 --> 01:18:57,451
(They'll cross their arms and watch.)

2206
01:18:57,680 --> 01:19:00,050
The lack of reattempt cards makes us dispirited.

2207
01:19:00,420 --> 01:19:02,120
I see that the reattempt cards are very powerful.

2208
01:19:02,121 --> 01:19:03,750
They're so powerful.

2209
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:06,220
What are we eating here?

2210
01:19:06,290 --> 01:19:08,329
We're going to Buan B, so it's steamed bun.

2211
01:19:08,330 --> 01:19:09,490
- Steamed bun. - Steamed bun.

2212
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:11,560
Hearing the name...

2213
01:19:11,561 --> 01:19:13,030
suddenly makes me crave for steamed buns.

2214
01:19:13,031 --> 01:19:14,031
(His mouth waters.)

2215
01:19:14,032 --> 01:19:16,031
The red bean paste should feel hot in the mouth.

2216
01:19:16,071 --> 01:19:17,177
It should be hot enough to burn.

2217
01:19:17,201 --> 01:19:19,100
Eating a hot red bean steamed bun...

2218
01:19:19,101 --> 01:19:20,601
with milk is the best.

2219
01:19:20,670 --> 01:19:22,240
(He loves milk.)

2220
01:19:22,241 --> 01:19:23,669
You drink so much milk.

2221
01:19:23,670 --> 01:19:25,610
It goes well with milk.

2222
01:19:25,611 --> 01:19:27,240
The combination is perfect.

2223
01:19:27,241 --> 01:19:29,380
Castella and steamed bun are the same.

2224
01:19:30,550 --> 01:19:32,380
Which question will we get for steamed bun?

2225
01:19:32,451 --> 01:19:34,920
I'll study up on steamed bun.

2226
01:19:35,290 --> 01:19:37,920
What's the difference between steamed bun and hoppang?

2227
01:19:38,090 --> 01:19:40,959
(What is it?)

2228
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:41,990
What is it?

2229
01:19:41,991 --> 01:19:44,129
I don't know. I just thought of the question.

2230
01:19:44,130 --> 01:19:45,329
(Gosh, Dong Hyun)

2231
01:19:45,330 --> 01:19:46,460
Hoppang...

2232
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:48,669
It could be a question.

2233
01:19:48,670 --> 01:19:49,670
(It's a good prediction.)

2234
01:19:50,031 --> 01:19:52,800
Steamed bun has red bean paste inside.

2235
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:54,970
How did the filling come to be?

2236
01:19:55,111 --> 01:19:57,510
Who began adding the red bean paste?

2237
01:20:00,510 --> 01:20:01,780

2239

- Hello. - Welcome.

Gosh, the atmosphere is incredible.

2250
01:20:36,451 --> 01:20:39,180
- This place is fun. - The atmosphere is incredible.

2251
01:20:39,481 --> 01:20:42,420
- We're doing a bakery tour. - Okay.

2252
01:20:42,491 --> 01:20:44,789
Many people visit this place for a bakery tour, right?

2253
01:20:44,790 --> 01:20:47,389
Yes. Many people visit. We're grateful for it.

Which product is famous?

2256
01:20:50,930 --> 01:20:52,829
Our steamed bun is famous.

2257
01:20:52,830 --> 01:20:56,469
If you make a round, you'll see the kinds.

2258

(The display is full of bread.)

2259
01:20:57,630 --> 01:21:00,700
- Steamed bun is famous. - Steamed bun.

2260
01:21:00,701 --> 01:21:03,301
- All of these are steamed buns. - All of these are steamed buns.

2261
01:21:03,670 --> 01:21:05,540
(They aren't the typical steamed buns...)

2262
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:07,179
They aren't the steamed buns I had in mind.

2263
01:21:07,180 --> 01:21:08,241
(you see every day.)

2264
01:21:09,050 --> 01:21:12,680
(There are 10 kinds of steamed buns.)

2265
01:21:13,021 --> 01:21:14,680
Milk cream steamed bun.

2266
01:21:15,191 --> 01:21:16,289
I'll eat this one.

2267
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:17,420
It's heavy.

2268
01:21:17,491 --> 01:21:19,690
You're right. It's heavier than I expected.

2269
01:21:19,691 --> 01:21:21,459
There's a lot inside.

2270
01:21:21,460 --> 01:21:22,490
- It's heavy. - You know how it is.

2271
01:21:22,491 --> 01:21:24,590
It'll be full of white cream when you open it.

2272
01:21:25,561 --> 01:21:27,200
Salted steamed bun.

2273
01:21:27,201 --> 01:21:28,999
It's two per person.

2274
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,100
Our products run out very fast.

2275
01:21:31,101 --> 01:21:33,200
Customers can't buy them if they come in the evening.

2276
01:21:33,201 --> 01:21:34,771
That makes me buy two.

2277
01:21:35,871 --> 01:21:38,580
- One warm steamed bun. - One warm steamed bun.

2278
01:21:39,111 --> 01:21:40,980
- Two, please. - Two warm steamed buns.

2279
01:21:40,981 --> 01:21:43,280
(They finish ordering steamed buns.)

2280
01:21:43,281 --> 01:21:44,709
Many places sell steamed buns.

2281

My father...

2284
01:21:49,090 --> 01:21:51,789
began making steamed buns in 1999.

2285
01:21:51,790 --> 01:21:54,759
We've made steamed buns using the crops from Buan...

2286
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:55,991
for 20 years.

2287
01:21:57,130 --> 01:21:59,500
(It began as a steamed bun place in the neighbourhood.)

2288
01:21:59,731 --> 01:22:02,601
(It grew in size.)

2289
01:22:03,031 --> 01:22:06,470
(The current place came to be after 26 years.)

2290
01:22:06,670 --> 01:22:09,669
Most steamed buns only has red bean paste inside.

2291
01:22:09,670 --> 01:22:11,770
- As you can see, - Yes.

2292
01:22:11,771 --> 01:22:13,980
We have a variety.

2293
01:22:13,981 --> 01:22:15,781
- They're original recipes. - Yes.

2297
01:22:23,420 --> 01:22:24,990
No. We're the same age.

2298
01:22:24,991 --> 01:22:26,121
- Really? - Yes.

2299
01:22:26,220 --> 01:22:27,419
You guys are the same age.

2300
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:28,490
(Embarrassed)

2301
01:22:28,491 --> 01:22:31,089
Right. I just look a bit old.

2302
01:22:31,090 --> 01:22:32,400
- He looks pretty old too. - No. I look old too.

2303
01:22:32,401 --> 01:22:33,641
You two should both be friends.

2304
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,030
(The men born in 1995 can really relate to each other.)

2305
01:22:36,031 --> 01:22:38,071
- You were born in 1995? - Yes. I was born in 1995.

2306
01:22:38,271 --> 01:22:39,271
I see.

2307
01:22:39,401 --> 01:22:40,970
We'll try them.

2308
01:22:42,771 --> 01:22:43,771
Awesome.

2309
01:22:44,241 --> 01:22:45,280
I'm really curious.

2310
01:22:45,281 --> 01:22:46,440
First,

2311
01:22:46,441 --> 01:22:48,440
I'll cut these two up.

2312
01:22:48,441 --> 01:22:49,911
- Right. - Let's give them a try.

2313
01:22:50,911 --> 01:22:51,980
Go ahead and try them.

2314
01:22:51,981 --> 01:22:53,719
(Representative dish, salted steamed bun)

2315
01:22:53,720 --> 01:22:54,820
Give it a try.

2316
01:22:54,821 --> 01:22:56,549
- I'll take this one. - Here.

2317
01:22:56,550 --> 01:22:58,621
(How does it taste?)

2318
01:23:00,491 --> 01:23:01,521
It's neat.

2319
01:23:03,790 --> 01:23:04,790
Gosh.

2320
01:23:04,791 --> 01:23:06,160
(Seung Ho takes a bite too.)

2321
01:23:06,161 --> 01:23:08,130
I love salted buns.

2322
01:23:08,601 --> 01:23:10,430
This is totally my style.

2323
01:23:11,231 --> 01:23:12,700
This is something you can't stop eating.

2324
01:23:12,701 --> 01:23:15,040
- In the past... - It does feel like a steamed bun.

2325
01:23:15,101 --> 01:23:16,240
The alcohol bun.

2326
01:23:16,241 --> 01:23:17,339
- Right. - The alcohol bun.

2327
01:23:17,340 --> 01:23:19,280
- At Namhansanseong, - Right.

2328
01:23:19,281 --> 01:23:21,281
There were trucks that sold alcohol buns.

2329
01:23:21,481 --> 01:23:22,579
It's the alcohol bun,

2330
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:23,680
- but it's salted. - Right.

2331
01:23:24,111 --> 01:23:25,481
It has a salty taste...

2332
01:23:25,981 --> 01:23:27,179
and the grease is left on your hand...

2333
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:28,420
just like the usual salted bun.

2334
01:23:29,451 --> 01:23:30,451
It's good.

2335
01:23:30,452 --> 01:23:32,196
(This is how the addicting salted steamed buns are made.)

2336
01:23:32,220 --> 01:23:35,021
(The steamed bun dough is taken out into balls.)

2337
01:23:36,330 --> 01:23:39,430
(They are rolled out into shape...)

2338
01:23:40,231 --> 01:23:42,470
(and spread out with the rolling pin.)

2339
01:23:42,970 --> 01:23:45,100
(The butter made with Gomso salt is placed inside...)

2340
01:23:45,101 --> 01:23:47,871
(and it's rolled up.)

2341
01:23:48,271 --> 01:23:50,741
(The dough for the salted steamed bun is ready.)

2342
01:23:52,481 --> 01:23:55,250
(They are steamed in the steamer for 30 minutes.)

2343
01:23:56,880 --> 01:23:59,880
(The salted steamed bun gets cooked.)

2344
01:24:00,351 --> 01:24:02,951
(The cooked salted steamed bun gets coated with melted butter...)

2345
01:24:04,951 --> 01:24:07,861
(and it is ready to eat.)

2346
01:24:08,161 --> 01:24:09,161
It's good.

2347
01:24:09,162 --> 01:24:11,960
(The final boss of an addicting taste)

2348
01:24:14,401 --> 01:24:16,481
You might end up eating ten of these once you start.

2349
01:24:16,930 --> 01:24:18,600
Do you want to try something else...

2350
01:24:18,601 --> 01:24:19,999
- or have the same one again? - Let's try something else.

2351
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,960
Let's try something else. Let's go with this one.

2352
01:24:22,941 --> 01:24:23,969
Gosh, it's good.

2353
01:24:23,970 --> 01:24:26,611
(Milk cream steamed bun)

2354
01:24:27,010 --> 01:24:29,170
I'm curious to see how it looks when it's cut in half.

2355
01:24:29,911 --> 01:24:32,351
- It's full of cream. - Gosh.

2356
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:34,680
You can already tell it will taste good.

2357
01:24:35,521 --> 01:24:36,719
(Passing it to Seung Ho)

2358
01:24:36,720 --> 01:24:37,750
Thank you.

2359
01:24:37,920 --> 01:24:39,520
(The youngest one takes a bite first.)

2360
01:24:39,521 --> 01:24:42,531
When it's split into half at the start...

2361
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:46,430
(Amazed)

2362
01:24:47,031 --> 01:24:50,000
(The barley guy takes a bite too.)

2363
01:24:50,531 --> 01:24:51,570
Gosh.

2364
01:24:51,571 --> 01:24:52,940
(Nodding)

2365
01:24:52,941 --> 01:24:55,241
This just has to be good.

2366
01:24:55,871 --> 01:24:58,371
(Dong Hyun takes a bite too.)

2367
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:00,510
(Amazed)

2368
01:25:00,941 --> 01:25:02,010
It's so good.

2369
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:03,610
It's just good.

2370
01:25:03,611 --> 01:25:04,709
(Thrilled)

2371
01:25:04,710 --> 01:25:06,179
It's fluffy like foam,

2372
01:25:06,180 --> 01:25:08,321
but the cream isn't greasy. It must be handmade.

2373
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:10,250
I've never tried anything like this.

2374
01:25:11,691 --> 01:25:14,990
(Landing on his lips even with a slight touch)

2375
01:25:14,991 --> 01:25:16,531
It washes away my concerns.

2376
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:19,130
This is so good.

2377
01:25:19,661 --> 01:25:20,799
The cream is amazing.

2378
01:25:20,800 --> 01:25:22,007
(The magical cream that makes you feel better)

2379
01:25:22,031 --> 01:25:24,031
- This is the red bean steamed bun. - Right.

2380
01:25:24,330 --> 01:25:25,371
The red bean steamed bun.

2381
01:25:25,941 --> 01:25:26,999
This is how it's served?

2382
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:28,670
(Warm red bean steamed bun)

2383
01:25:29,210 --> 01:25:30,241
This is amazing.

2384
01:25:30,571 --> 01:25:31,571
I'll give it a try.

2385
01:25:31,572 --> 01:25:33,311
- We can each have one. - Gosh, it's hot!

2386
01:25:33,941 --> 01:25:36,151
Steamed buns have to be hot to be good.

2387
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:39,621
The buns here are pretty heavy.

2388
01:25:39,981 --> 01:25:41,080
It's heavy...

2389
01:25:41,380 --> 01:25:43,220
because there's so much red bean paste inside.

2390
01:25:43,750 --> 01:25:44,789
The dough is thin...

2391
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:46,720
and you can see the red bean paste inside.

2392
01:25:47,191 --> 01:25:48,389
(The barley guy that wanted the steamed bun...)

2393
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:49,590
(carefully takes a bite.)

2394
01:25:49,861 --> 01:25:50,861
This is it.

2395
01:25:51,191 --> 01:25:53,061
(Greatly satisfied)

2396
01:25:53,300 --> 01:25:55,830
(He takes a bite of the hot steamed bun he was excited for.)

2397
01:25:58,771 --> 01:26:00,740
They must've crushed the red beans for the paste.

2398
01:26:00,741 --> 01:26:02,139
- Right. - Right.

2399
01:26:02,140 --> 01:26:03,209
You can feel the beans.

2400
01:26:03,210 --> 01:26:04,870
(You can feel the beans in the bun filled with paste.)

2401
01:26:04,871 --> 01:26:05,880
Gosh, it's hot.

2402
01:26:07,311 --> 01:26:08,679
- Gosh, it's hot! - This is the original steamed bun.

2403
01:26:08,680 --> 01:26:09,710
Gosh, it's hot.

2404
01:26:09,911 --> 01:26:11,879
You know how Dong Hyun looks like...

2405
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,919
- characters of old cartoons, right? - Me?

2406
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:16,951
He's like the character from "Black Rubber Shoes."

2407
01:26:17,121 --> 01:26:18,289
Gosh, it's good.

2408
01:26:18,290 --> 01:26:19,959
(Laughing)

2409
01:26:19,960 --> 01:26:20,960
It's good.

2410
01:26:20,961 --> 01:26:23,031
(He takes another bite while enduring the heat.)

2411
01:26:23,830 --> 01:26:25,161
The other buns are good,

2412
01:26:25,901 --> 01:26:28,660
but this one brings back memories.

2413
01:26:28,661 --> 01:26:29,929
- Right. - This is what it's like.

2414
01:26:29,930 --> 01:26:31,101
I wasn't going to have it.

2415
01:26:31,170 --> 01:26:32,170
(A line of evaluation for the red bean steamed bun)

2416
01:26:32,171 --> 01:26:33,200
We ate all of them.

2417
01:26:33,201 --> 01:26:35,441
(Classic is permanent.)

2418
01:26:35,771 --> 01:26:37,540
My body is starting to sweat now.

2419
01:26:38,470 --> 01:26:40,880
It's definitely about the steamed bun or red bean paste.

2420
01:26:41,281 --> 01:26:43,510
It's definitely about the steamed bun or red beans.

2421
01:26:44,250 --> 01:26:45,379
Red beans.

2422
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:47,451
(Red beans)

2423
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:49,651
Were they eaten during Dano?

2424
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:52,121
- Dongzhi. - Oh, right.

2425
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:54,120
Sorry.

2426
01:26:54,121 --> 01:26:55,560
(Embarrassed)

2427
01:26:55,561 --> 01:26:56,959
- I'm sorry. - No. That can happen.

2428
01:26:56,960 --> 01:26:58,629
Right. It's a social phenomenon.

2429
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,390
- It's a social phenomenon. - It can happen.

2430
01:27:00,561 --> 01:27:02,001
It's because I know a lot of things.

2431
01:27:02,231 --> 01:27:03,329
(Buan B, steamed bun)

2432
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:04,330
(Quiz time)

2433
01:27:04,331 --> 01:27:05,500
Here's the quiz.

2434
01:27:05,771 --> 01:27:08,201
In the "The Collected Works of Lee Deok Moo..."

2435
01:27:08,470 --> 01:27:09,470
written by Lee Deok Moo, a Silhak scholar...

2436
01:27:09,471 --> 01:27:10,787
of the latter period of the Joseon Dynasty,

2437
01:27:10,811 --> 01:27:14,311
the recipe of this bread is recorded like this.

2438
01:27:14,481 --> 01:27:17,851
"A small box of fine flour and 1200g of white sugar..."

2439
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:20,250
"is made into a dough with eight eggs."

2440
01:27:20,481 --> 01:27:22,120
"It's put into a copper pot..."

2441
01:27:22,121 --> 01:27:25,250
"and cooked until it is yellow with a charcoal fire."

2442
01:27:25,590 --> 01:27:27,220
What kind of bread is this?

2443
01:27:29,731 --> 01:27:30,759
What is it?

2444
01:27:30,760 --> 01:27:31,760
(Does he know this?)

2445
01:27:32,061 --> 01:27:33,459
- The castella! - The castella?

2446
01:27:33,460 --> 01:27:35,160
- The castella. - The castella!

2447
01:27:35,161 --> 01:27:37,600
- You're right. - The castella!

2448
01:27:37,601 --> 01:27:39,100
(Are they getting the answer at once so easily like this?)

2449
01:27:39,101 --> 01:27:41,441
- You're right. - This is why I know this.

2450
01:27:41,670 --> 01:27:43,087
People will think this to themselves.

2451
01:27:43,111 --> 01:27:44,440
"How was castella around back then?"

2452
01:27:44,441 --> 01:27:45,469
- They were around! - They were around!

2453
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:47,441
They were pronounced differently.

2454
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:50,280
"Gastella?" "Gasutella?"

2455
01:27:50,281 --> 01:27:51,579
The word was written with Chinese characters.

2456
01:27:51,580 --> 01:27:53,300
At the latter period of the Joseon Dynasty,

2457
01:27:53,451 --> 01:27:54,620
all kinds of Western products have already been brought in.

2458
01:27:54,621 --> 01:27:55,621
Right.

2459
01:27:55,622 --> 01:27:57,589
It was the time when Western products from places like...

2460
01:27:57,590 --> 01:27:59,020
the Netherlands and the US have all come in.

2461
01:27:59,021 --> 01:28:00,520
For at least once,

2462
01:28:00,521 --> 01:28:02,566
I wanted a question to be asked that could be answered right away.

2463
01:28:02,590 --> 01:28:04,160
So you're 100-percent certain.

2464
01:28:04,161 --> 01:28:05,289
I'm 137-percent certain.

2465
01:28:05,290 --> 01:28:06,400
I'm 20,000-percent certain.

2466
01:28:06,401 --> 01:28:07,499
- All right. - Okay.

2467
01:28:07,500 --> 01:28:08,500
Okay.

2468
01:28:08,501 --> 01:28:10,330
The answer is "castella."

2469
01:28:11,071 --> 01:28:12,170
- "Castella." - Yes.

2470
01:28:13,241 --> 01:28:14,370
Don't even look at them.

2471
01:28:14,371 --> 01:28:16,039
- You said you were certain. - Forget it.

2472
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,760
Let's just eat. Get ready for the next one.

2473
01:28:18,470 --> 01:28:20,179
- "Castella." - You never know.

2474
01:28:20,180 --> 01:28:22,451
I might collapse if it's incorrect.

2475
01:28:22,611 --> 01:28:23,611
Correct!

2476
01:28:23,612 --> 01:28:25,879
I told you it was correct.

2477
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:27,249
- It was castella. - Finally!

2478
01:28:27,250 --> 01:28:28,320
(Touched)

2479
01:28:28,321 --> 01:28:29,351
That was amazing.

2480
01:28:29,451 --> 01:28:30,750
(Feeling emotional)

2481
01:28:30,951 --> 01:28:32,289
Dong Hyun talked about this...

2482
01:28:32,290 --> 01:28:33,789
- all day long. - Right.

2483
01:28:33,790 --> 01:28:34,919
For at least once,

2484
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:36,736
I wanted a question that I could answer right away.

2485
01:28:36,760 --> 01:28:39,100
Right. One must study.

2486
01:28:39,101 --> 01:28:41,560
Back then, it was called "gasujeora."

2487
01:28:41,561 --> 01:28:43,570
- Right. "Gasujeora!" - You were close.

2488
01:28:43,571 --> 01:28:44,901
It was "gasujeora."

2489
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:47,240
- "Gasujeora!" - "Gasujeora!"

2490
01:28:47,241 --> 01:28:48,241
"Gasujeora!"

2491
01:28:48,242 --> 01:28:52,879
(Buan B, steamed bun)

2492
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,579
This place feels great.

2493
01:28:54,580 --> 01:28:57,450
- Right. It has a great energy. - Thank you for letting us leave...

2494
01:28:57,451 --> 01:28:58,611
with a great feeling.

2495
01:28:58,811 --> 01:29:00,900
It should feel greasy, but it doesn't taste that way at all.

2496
01:29:01,561 --> 01:29:03,861
(The Bakery Tour Race continues.)

2497
01:29:04,061 --> 01:29:07,169
(Current score tied at 2 to 2.)

2498
01:29:07,170 --> 01:29:09,101
(They don't have the reattempt card, )

2499
01:29:09,471 --> 01:29:14,340
(but Team Guys is on fire.)

2500
01:29:14,571 --> 01:29:16,111
(In the end, )

2501
01:29:17,380 --> 01:29:18,811
(they take the lead.)

2502
01:29:19,311 --> 01:29:21,280
(A win even without the reattempt card?)

2503
01:29:21,450 --> 01:29:23,620
(We can't stay back like this.)

2504
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:24,980
(Sang Uk goes for the answer.)

2505
01:29:24,981 --> 01:29:26,820
(No. Go back.)

2506
01:29:26,821 --> 01:29:28,920
(You jerk! Get away, you demon!)

2507
01:29:29,191 --> 01:29:31,436
(This happened because of the demon of incorrect answers, Sang Uk?)

2508
01:29:31,460 --> 01:29:33,561
(I have no clue.)

2509
01:29:33,790 --> 01:29:35,910
(Even John who had everyone's trust starts wavering.)

2510
01:29:36,361 --> 01:29:38,001
(They even use up their reattempt cards.)

2511
01:29:38,401 --> 01:29:41,400
(We need to make a big move to take the win!)

2512
01:29:41,401 --> 01:29:42,699
(The last hope)

2513
01:29:42,700 --> 01:29:44,170
(Imsil, cheesecake)

2514
01:29:44,441 --> 01:29:46,971
(The one who takes the center will take the win?)

2515
01:29:47,311 --> 01:29:50,210
(Set the flag at Imsil to take the win.)

2516
01:29:50,740 --> 01:29:53,981
(At the end of this crazy and unpredictable race, )

2517
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:59,221
(which team will end with a smile?)

2518
01:29:59,620 --> 01:30:02,861
(I'm desperate to win.)

2519
01:30:03,321 --> 01:30:07,960
(Which team will take the win?)

2520
01:30:09,224 --> 01:30:12,224
