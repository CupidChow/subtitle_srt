(Nowon-gu)

14
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:05,559
Where are we? What is this place?

15
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:06,929
"Urban Life Exhibition?"

16
00:01:08,429 --> 00:01:09,728

(Through a collection of nostalgic items)

22
00:01:18,039 --> 00:01:19,338
It looks very nice here.

23
00:01:19,339 --> 00:01:21,079
(A place where you can see the recent past)

24
00:01:21,939 --> 00:01:23,179
Tae Hyun, it's Mr. Choi Bul Am.

25
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:25,979
Aren't these photos of your friends?

26
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:27,479
- No way.
- Aren't they?

27
00:01:27,719 --> 00:01:29,348
No, they are not.

28
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:30,549
Mr. Choi Bul Am is...

29
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:31,948
Here's Tae Hyun in the photo.

30
00:01:31,949 --> 00:01:34,959
Tae Hyun, isn't that you in the photo?

31
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:36,788
Let's be honest.

32
00:01:36,789 --> 00:01:38,388
- I'm not much older than you.
- That's not true.

33
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,429
Gosh, it's Pony.

34
00:01:40,129 --> 00:01:42,599

35
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,238
(The icon of family cars from the 80s to the 90s)

36
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,298
- This is from your generation.
- It is.

37
00:01:47,299 --> 00:01:49,609
My dad used to drive this car.

38
00:01:49,939 --> 00:01:51,068
I rode it during my childhood.

39
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,469
My family had it.

40
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:54,809
I remember taking a taxi that looked like this.

41
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:56,608
This is what I remember.

42
00:01:56,609 --> 00:01:58,708
Back then, the base fare for a taxi was 60 cents.

43
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:00,295
(The base fare was 60 cents during the 80s.)

44
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:03,319
Here's the problem today.

45
00:02:04,549 --> 00:02:06,188
- We have to draw on his face.
- I have to do it.

46
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:07,889
- Please get it started.
- Is it Yi Kyung?

47
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:09,729
I don't know how we will do it.

48
00:02:10,329 --> 00:02:11,329
Do you have it?

49
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:13,589
- We should do it in moderation.
- Of course.

50
00:02:13,729 --> 00:02:15,199
Do you have a wig?

51
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:16,645
- We don't have a wig.
- Dong Hyun.

52
00:02:16,669 --> 00:02:17,828
Think about next week.

53
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,638
- I'm always up for it.
- Dong Hyun is invincible.

54
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,038
- He's invincible.
- Think about next week.

55
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,098
I'd be happy to do it.

56

(The fighter who isn't afraid of wearing makeup)

57
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:25,339
Go ahead. I'll stay still.

58
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:28,538
(Seung Ho starts the makeup.)

59
00:02:28,539 --> 00:02:29,649
Whatever you want.

60
00:02:30,009 --> 00:02:32,378
(Applying seriously)

61
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:33,948
- I'll make you look cute.
- Don't make it cute.

62
00:02:33,949 --> 00:02:35,448
If it's you next week, I'll put makeup on you.

63
00:02:35,449 --> 00:02:37,118
Okay, I heard you.

64
00:02:37,119 --> 00:02:38,595

(Laughing)

67
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:45,258
He got gray hair now.

68
00:02:45,259 --> 00:02:46,799
I have a lot of premature gray hair.

69
00:02:46,899 --> 00:02:48,599
Brace yourself for next week.

70
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:50,229
You're done.

71
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:52,328
You look nice.

72
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,699
- You look cute.
- This is...

73
00:02:53,899 --> 00:02:56,039
(Dong Hyun is satisfied.)

74
00:02:56,339 --> 00:02:57,939
It looks good on you. Take a look.

75
00:02:58,539 --> 00:02:59,579
In my opinion...

76
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:01,979
It's obvious that you lost.

77
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:04,249

79
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:08,078
For you to look here.

80
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,419
Next time...

81
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:11,249
Today's guest is someone...

82
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:13,259
Seung Ho and I saw...

83
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,959
recently.

84
00:03:15,559 --> 00:03:16,729
- I see.
- That's him.

85
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,458
He and I went on a trip together.

86
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:20,459
I see.

87
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:21,459
(Who is it?)

88
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,099
Seriously?

89
00:03:24,099 --> 00:03:25,099
(He's here.)

90
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:27,838
I wanted to appear secretly.

91

92

94
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:41,279
(They had quite an experience while traveling in Brazil.)

95
00:03:41,849 --> 00:03:46,189
(He and Tae Hyun went to Europe.)

96
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:47,988
- Gosh.
- Introduce yourself.

97
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:49,118
I'm jobless, and I travel.

98
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:50,788
I'm Pani Bottle. Nice to meet you.

99
00:03:50,789 --> 00:03:52,559
(A traveling jobless man, Pani Bottle)

100
00:03:52,929 --> 00:03:54,829
He's like a champion in this field.

101
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,468
- I'm trying to create contents.
- On YouTube.

102
00:03:57,469 --> 00:03:59,639
He's a champion in Korea in that field.

103
00:03:59,969 --> 00:04:01,399
Now that you're here...

104
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,408
- Is Pani Bottle older than you?
- As I appear much younger...

105
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:04,668
Pani Bottle is one year older than me.

106
00:04:04,669 --> 00:04:05,838
I was born in 1987.

107
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:07,009
He's turning 40 soon.

108
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:08,939
- Really?
- I'm nearing 40 very soon.

109
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,808
I thought that he was about my age.

110
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:12,289
- Really?
- I'm nearing 40 very soon.

111
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:13,478
You traveled with both of them,

112
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,279
but their eating style is different.

113
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,418
One of them eats a lot,

114
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:17,648
and the other eats little.

115
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,788
- I was really shocked.
- I see.

116
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:21,888
When I met Seung Ho, I knew...

117
00:04:21,889 --> 00:04:23,088
that he would eat well.

118
00:04:23,089 --> 00:04:24,758
However, I didn't expect him to eat a lot.

119
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:26,598
When he's hungry,

120
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,028
- he gets irritated.
- Right.

121
00:04:28,029 --> 00:04:29,259
In the car...

122
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,428
So it's the same.

123
00:04:30,429 --> 00:04:33,269
(So he was the same with you.)

124
00:04:33,369 --> 00:04:34,698
For Tae Hyun,

125
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:37,208
it wasn't about how much he ate.

126
00:04:37,209 --> 00:04:39,779
When I asked him, "Are you okay with paragliding?"

127
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:41,738
he would say, "Okay, let's go."

128
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,048
He never refuses anything.

129
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:45,078
Today,

130
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:47,178
with Pani Bottle,

131
00:04:47,179 --> 00:04:48,648
we came to Gongneung-dong.

132
00:04:48,649 --> 00:04:50,218
- Gongneung-dong.
- We're in Gongneung-dong today.

133
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:51,618
Isn't Taereung...

134
00:04:51,619 --> 00:04:53,318
- also nearby?
- That's right.

135
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:55,489
- This is my hometown.
- Right.

136
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:57,388
- I see.
- I was at Taereung Training Center.

137
00:04:57,389 --> 00:04:59,058
When I went back and forth from here to Chuncheon,

138
00:04:59,059 --> 00:05:00,819
I always passed by Taereung Training Center.

139
00:05:00,859 --> 00:05:02,158
- There's Korea Military Academy.
- Right.

140
00:05:02,159 --> 00:05:03,228
The training center is right in front of that.

141
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:04,398
There are Seoul Women's University...

142
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,768
- and Kwangwoon University.
- There's also your school.

143
00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:07,238
There's Seoul National University of Science and Technology...

144
00:05:07,239 --> 00:05:08,698
where I graduated from.

145
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:10,779
It used to be called Seoul University of Technology.

146
00:05:10,939 --> 00:05:12,238
The name changed.

147
00:05:12,239 --> 00:05:14,378
That's why I lived here for 5 to 6 years.

148
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,308
I started living here when I was 20,

149
00:05:16,309 --> 00:05:17,949
so that was about 20 years ago.

150
00:05:18,179 --> 00:05:20,578
(Today's Menu Recommendation Neighborhood: Gongneung-dong)

151

(An educational hub packed with prestigious universities)

153
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:29,288
There used to be a railway.

154
00:05:29,289 --> 00:05:31,128
There was Gyeongchun Line to Chuncheon.

155

(A neighborhood with Gyeongchun Line)

156
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,358
When Gyeongchun Line got closed,

157
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:36,529
a forest trail was created.

158
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,298
Trains no longer run here.

159
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:39,998
That trail was made...

160
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:41,839
after I graduated.

161
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:44,939
As there are many pretty cafes along the trail,

162
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:47,439
many people called me to visit them.

163
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:52,109
(Mangwon-dong of Nowon-gu, Gongneung)

164
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:53,978
- In Gongneung-dong, - Where are we going?

165
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,678
Who will recommend today's lunch?

166
00:05:55,679 --> 00:05:57,318
- I'll introduce them.
- What?

167
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,949
I did some research for today.

168
00:05:58,989 --> 00:06:01,518
- One of them is yukgaejang.
- What?

169
00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:02,718
It's a popular yukgaejang restaurant.

170
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:04,289
There's yukgaejang in Gongneung?

- Lasagna?

173
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:14,398
- Lasagna?
- Lasagna.

174
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:16,539
- Isn't it rectangular?
- Yes.

175
00:06:16,669 --> 00:06:18,138
Have you eaten it often?

176
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:19,808
I've tried it once.

177
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:21,739
It's an Italian dish, isn't it?

178
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:24,078
- Or is it Spanish?
- I don't know that much.

00:06:25,609 --> 00:06:26,718
I'm going to Italy...

181
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,978
- two days from now.
- Two days from now?

182
00:06:27,979 --> 00:06:30,018
I've never really traveled there. I'm going there two days from now,

183
00:06:30,019 --> 00:06:31,418
but I haven't had a lot of lasagna.

184
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:32,519
Maybe I tried it once.

185
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:34,219
It'd be perfect to try it today.

186
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:39,699
(Lasagna that's full of cheese flavor)

187
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:43,399
(Today's LMR: Yukgaejang and lasagna)

188
00:06:43,899 --> 00:06:45,668
Dong Hyun, I have a question.

189
00:06:45,669 --> 00:06:46,898
I know your question already.

190
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:47,968
Do the restaurants have side dishes...

191
00:06:47,969 --> 00:06:49,209
- or anything special?
- Right.

192
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,468
You know?

193
00:06:50,469 --> 00:06:51,768
I definitely know.

194
00:06:51,769 --> 00:06:53,578
When you tell Seung Ho about a dish...

195
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,608
- A side dish?
- You have to tell him...

196
00:06:54,609 --> 00:06:56,378
what they have as a side dish.

197
00:06:56,379 --> 00:06:57,578
Instead of looking at a tree,

198
00:06:57,579 --> 00:06:59,849
- I look at the forest out of habit.
- Exactly.

199
00:07:00,049 --> 00:07:01,778
- I only brought up the tree.
- What accompanies yukgaejang?

200
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:04,048
- Is it dumplings?
- The yukgaejang restaurant has...

201
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:05,749
different types of yukgaejang.

202
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:08,319
To find out if there are other dishes,

203
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:09,959
we must go there.

204
00:07:10,529 --> 00:07:11,688
- And...
- This is good too.

205
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:12,759
Just imagine it.

206
00:07:12,789 --> 00:07:15,728
What is your decision?

207
00:07:15,729 --> 00:07:17,229
- I made up my mind.
- What?

208
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:18,769
I'll have yukgaejang today.

209
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:20,798
- Why?
- Today is...

210
00:07:20,799 --> 00:07:21,998
hot.

211
00:07:21,999 --> 00:07:23,479
I'll overcome the heat with hot food.

212
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,009
I'll have lasagna.

213
00:07:25,239 --> 00:07:27,738
My choice is lasagna. I can't eat anything spicy...

214
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:30,509
- on an empty stomach.
- Then it's decided.

215
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:32,809
I can't eat spicy food, so I pick lasagna.

216
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:35,019
I can hardly eat spicy food.

217
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,619
What about you, Sang Uk?

218
00:07:36,749 --> 00:07:38,588
I really like both of them.

219
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:39,719
That's my case exactly.

220
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:41,988
In that case...

221
00:07:41,989 --> 00:07:43,088
Let's get yukgaejang, Sang Uk.

222
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:44,769
I need you on my team so that I don't pay.

223
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,698
(Insurance Sang Uk to avoid paying for the meal)

224
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:48,928
- Is it because of money?
- Yes.

225
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:49,929
He feels reassured.

226
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,468
- We really have to pay, right?
- Yes.

227
00:07:51,469 --> 00:07:52,469
- It's for real.
- For real?

228
00:07:52,469 --> 00:07:53,469
We really have to pay.

229
00:07:53,569 --> 00:07:54,638
Oh, right.

230
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:57,138
- Can I tell you some news?
- Sure.

231
00:07:57,139 --> 00:07:58,368
Moon Se Yoon opened...

232
00:07:58,369 --> 00:08:00,108
- Didn't he open a gym?
- a gym.

233
00:08:00,109 --> 00:08:01,178
- It's been updated.
- Again?

234
00:08:01,179 --> 00:08:02,539
Why does he keep doing that?

235
00:08:02,609 --> 00:08:04,509
I went to see him in the waiting room.

236
00:08:04,649 --> 00:08:06,009
He said, "I still believe it."

237
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,118
"I believe that they'll reimburse me for what I paid."

238
00:08:09,119 --> 00:08:10,348
(That they'll reimburse me)

239
00:08:10,349 --> 00:08:13,619
"I believe that tvN will reimburse me."

240
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:16,988
That's the most recent update on him.

241
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:18,888
Why wasn't I informed...

242
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:20,898
when I was invited to the show? That's strange.

243
00:08:20,899 --> 00:08:21,928
We don't tell you.

244
00:08:21,929 --> 00:08:23,768
Isn't this the most important part?

245
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,068
We don't tell you about it.

246
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:26,898
We're not telling you to pay. Answer the quiz...

247
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:28,168
- Just get the right answer.
- after enjoying the food.

248
00:08:28,169 --> 00:08:29,468
Right.

249
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:31,109
I'm sweating all of a sudden.

250
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:33,578
Last week,

251
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:36,079
we decided on the makeup punishment at dinner.

252
00:08:36,139 --> 00:08:37,408
Why don't we change it from the total number...

253
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:39,818
- to the total number of payment?
- The number of payment?

254
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:41,418
- Let's go with that.
- That sounds good.

255
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:42,878
We can enjoy food as much as you want.

256
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:44,348
There are four meals.

257
00:08:44,349 --> 00:08:46,288
- The one who pays the most.
- For today,

258
00:08:46,289 --> 00:08:47,849
we'll base it on the number of payment.

259
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:49,158
- All right.
- The problem is,

260
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,388
which restaurant will we go first?

261
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:52,289
All right. Today,

262
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:53,998
you'll have yukgaejang first.

263
00:08:53,999 --> 00:08:55,128
Yes, we got it.

264
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:56,129
I'm satisfied.

265
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:57,998
Do you know why we're happy?

266
00:08:57,999 --> 00:08:59,169
Eating first is the best.

267
00:09:02,139 --> 00:09:04,939
Let's go.

268
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:07,108
Thanks to this show, I get to travel...

269
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:10,049
- everywhere in Seoul.
- I know.

270
00:09:10,979 --> 00:09:12,078
Let's go.

271
00:09:12,079 --> 00:09:14,178
(Checking the camera angle before departing)

272
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,878
You're an expert at filming.

273
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,948
- Look at the camera angle.
- You must be used to it.

274
00:09:17,949 --> 00:09:19,489
You have to stretch out your arm.

275
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:21,289
My arm is already so short.

276
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:24,258
What was your major at the university?

277
00:09:24,259 --> 00:09:25,489
I entered the school...

278
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:27,428
- to major in pottery.
- Pottery?

279
00:09:27,429 --> 00:09:28,858
I also majored in visual design.

280
00:09:28,859 --> 00:09:30,628
- So you studied art.
- Yes, I went to art school.

281
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:32,568
- You did pottery.
- And visual design.

282
00:09:32,569 --> 00:09:33,938
- He studied pottery.
- Pottery.

283
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:34,968
Pani Bottle,

284
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:37,408
- you should've drawn this on me.
- Right.

285
00:09:37,409 --> 00:09:38,669
That's right.

286
00:09:39,339 --> 00:09:40,778
In Gongneung,

287
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,039
many restaurants open and shut down.

288
00:09:43,809 --> 00:09:45,908
All the restaurants I knew are gone now.

289
00:09:45,909 --> 00:09:47,179
I agree.

290
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,648
It has changed a lot.

291
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:50,148
Were you here for training?

292
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:53,519
Yes, I lived here about eight years ago.

293
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:55,618
The restaurants are...

294
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:57,428
- Here it is.
- Isn't it a cafe?

295
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,799
- The exterior looks hip.
- It looks hip.

296
00:09:59,929 --> 00:10:01,659
Goodness, it's hip.

297
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:03,329
It has a nice vibe.

298
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:09,169
(A young restaurant with a trendy vibe)

299
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:18,779
(Everything on our menu is red.)

300
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:21,279
(Yukgaltang, JMT, Mimi)

301
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,949
(Yukgaejang, yukramyeon, yukgaltang, yukgalramyeon...)

302
00:10:24,789 --> 00:10:29,459
(The restaurant is known for its rich and thick broth.)

303
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:31,488
(Sweet tomato and spicy broth explode with flavors.)

304
00:10:31,489 --> 00:10:33,475
(It looks like a Japanese restaurant with Korean food.)

305
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:37,299
(LMR 1, yukgaejang)

306
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:39,268
This place...

307
00:10:39,269 --> 00:10:40,399
My gosh.

308
00:10:40,799 --> 00:10:42,238
This place is...

309
00:10:42,239 --> 00:10:43,738
It doesn't look ordinary.

310
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:44,839
It feels like...

311
00:10:45,809 --> 00:10:47,378
It's not an ordinary restaurant.

312
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,378
(He's the only one busy.)

313
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:51,048
- You can tell right away.
- Look at Pani Bottle.

314
00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:53,079
As soon as he entered,

315
00:10:53,379 --> 00:10:55,019
he set up his camera.

316
00:10:55,419 --> 00:10:56,849
- The holder...
- He's an expert.

317
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,088
As expected.

318
00:10:58,089 --> 00:10:59,289
It has a holder already.

319
00:10:59,989 --> 00:11:01,018
- He's a GoPro expert.
- We're at a yukgaejang place,

320
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:03,729
- but it looks like a bar.
- You're right.

321
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:05,688
It looks like a ramen restaurant.

322
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:07,298
I'm curious about the restaurant owner.

323
00:11:07,299 --> 00:11:08,575
How did he open such a restaurant?

324
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:09,758
- Hello.
- Hello.

325
00:11:09,759 --> 00:11:11,229
- Sir.
- Hello.

326
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:13,568
- He looks very young.
- I'm not.

327
00:11:13,569 --> 00:11:15,339
Did your father start this restaurant?

328
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:16,568
I have a friend...

329
00:11:16,569 --> 00:11:18,538
who's running a gukbap restaurant in Mangwon.

330
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:21,479
It's been handed down for three generations.

331
00:11:22,009 --> 00:11:24,778
As I like gukbap,

332
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,749
I learned how to make it.

333
00:11:26,779 --> 00:11:28,078
After learning for two years,

334
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,419
my friend recognized my skills.

335
00:11:30,919 --> 00:11:33,119
I opened up a restaurant in my neighborhood.

336
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,988
So you live in Gongneung.

337
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:38,788
It's been about two years.

338
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:41,459
Do you get many customers now?

339
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:43,828
I have many frequent customers.

340
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,669
- I imagine so.
- There's even a waiting line.

341
00:11:46,229 --> 00:11:49,838
(A new and rising restaurant that's full every day)

342
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,278
One advantage is that I can come here easily to eat alone.

343
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:54,608
There are yukgaltang...

344
00:11:54,609 --> 00:11:56,039
and tomato yukgaejang.

345
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:58,749
As I can taste yukgaejang with a good vibe,

346
00:11:58,879 --> 00:12:01,249
I come here often.

347
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:04,418
Is that tomato ramyeon on the menu?

348
00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,188
Is it tomato yukgaejang?

349
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:08,918
It must be yukgaejang for those who can't eat spicy food.

350
00:12:08,919 --> 00:12:10,628
Isn't that the purpose?

351
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,928
That's part of it, and it tastes more like a stew.

352
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:14,229
Tomato yukgaejang?

353
00:12:14,299 --> 00:12:15,429
Do they go well together?

354
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:18,468
In yukgalramyeon,

355
00:12:18,469 --> 00:12:19,998
does "gal" mean...

356
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:21,668
- short ribs?
- Yes, it has short ribs.

357
00:12:21,669 --> 00:12:23,468
It includes three short ribs.

358
00:12:23,469 --> 00:12:24,568
Three?

359
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:25,569
That sounds so good.

360
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:27,838
I'm a huge fan of galbitang.

361
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:28,979
Galbitang?

362
00:12:29,109 --> 00:12:32,149
How would I have known that there would be ribs here?

363
00:12:32,179 --> 00:12:34,879
I'd like yukgal...

364
00:12:35,719 --> 00:12:36,849
tang?

365
00:12:37,149 --> 00:12:38,889
- Yukgaltang?
- Ramyeontang?

366
00:12:38,949 --> 00:12:40,618
We can order several dishes.

367
00:12:40,619 --> 00:12:43,528
Each of you should get...

368
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:44,828
a signature meal.

369
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:46,798
Order 1 ramyeon for 2 people.

370
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:47,898
Look, he's starting again.

371
00:12:47,899 --> 00:12:48,928
Listen.

372
00:12:48,929 --> 00:12:50,498
We'll get three yukgaltang,

373
00:12:50,499 --> 00:12:52,898
one yukramyeon, one tomato ramyeon.

374
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:54,038
- Okay.
- That's good.

375
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,519
- Thank you.
- The order sounds good.

376
00:12:55,569 --> 00:12:57,869
When you eat ramyeon,

377
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:59,669
do you cook 1 or 2 packs?

378
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:01,408
- I cook 1 pack.
- I cook 1 pack.

379
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:02,478
Me too.

380
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:03,578
That's surprising.

381
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:04,979
Do you mean one individual pack?

382
00:13:05,209 --> 00:13:06,949
- Yes.
- What about the ramyeon seasoning?

383
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:09,678
- Didn't you mean a pack this size?
- A bundle?

384
00:13:09,679 --> 00:13:11,288
(A pack of 5 ramyeon)

385
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:12,618
- Yes.
- Do you eat five...

386
00:13:12,619 --> 00:13:14,918
- at a time?
- I eat 4 or 5.

387
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,188
Definitely.

388
00:13:16,189 --> 00:13:17,288
For one meal.

389
00:13:17,289 --> 00:13:18,758
Sang Uk, I meant for one meal.

390
00:13:18,759 --> 00:13:20,798
- Because you said 1 or 2...
- Hey.

391
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:23,398
One pack of ramyeon is just one.

392
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,398
- Here's what I do.
- A bundle of five.

393
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:26,668
I split one pack in half.

394
00:13:26,669 --> 00:13:29,038
I only eat half. With the remaining broth,

395
00:13:29,039 --> 00:13:30,309
I finish it with rice.

396
00:13:30,409 --> 00:13:31,689
I eat the other half for dinner.

397
00:13:31,739 --> 00:13:33,068
- In the past...
- Just one pack?

398
00:13:33,069 --> 00:13:36,139
My question is, why do you split it in half?

399
00:13:36,279 --> 00:13:38,209
I'm sorry.

400
00:13:39,109 --> 00:13:40,279
I'll never do it again.

401
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:42,648
Whenever I eat alone,

402
00:13:42,649 --> 00:13:44,519
I order a side dish that I can freeze.

403
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:46,388
I can't finish it no matter what.

404
00:13:46,389 --> 00:13:48,088
You think about freezing it in advance?

405
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:50,828
At home, I have microorganisms...

406
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,028
that process food waste.

407
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:53,359
They eat more than I do.

408
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:55,398
They eat well.

409
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,168
- They're lucky to live there.
- They're lucky.

410
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:00,139
Those microorganisms sound lucky.

411
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:02,268
I call them an army of microorganisms.

412
00:14:02,269 --> 00:14:03,568
They always...

413
00:14:03,569 --> 00:14:05,568
My friend, Kwaktube says...

414
00:14:05,569 --> 00:14:08,438
that his microorganisms die because there isn't a lot of food waste.

415
00:14:08,439 --> 00:14:10,708
He brought those microorganisms home...

416
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:12,508
to kill them.

417
00:14:12,509 --> 00:14:14,079
(Laughing)

418
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:15,449
The food is here.

419
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:17,819
- Please excuse me.
- Please bring us a lot of food.

420
00:14:18,749 --> 00:14:19,819
(Exclaiming)

421
00:14:20,619 --> 00:14:21,658
Please bring us a lot of food.

422
00:14:21,659 --> 00:14:22,759
There's also kiwi.

423
00:14:23,289 --> 00:14:25,989
(Cover the bottom with onions, green onions, and mushrooms.)

424
00:14:26,589 --> 00:14:28,259
(Gently place 3 large short ribs on top)

425
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:32,729
(Pour secret seasoning and broth that he learned how to make.)

426
00:14:33,369 --> 00:14:36,169
(Let it simmer until the broth thickens.)

427
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:39,809
(Boil again after adding egg mixture and mung bean sprouts.)

428
00:14:41,309 --> 00:14:45,679
(The first dish, yukgaltang is ready.)

429
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:47,879
Why am I regretting my choice?

430
00:14:48,249 --> 00:14:49,249
It usually happens.

431
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,518
You can't help but regret.

432
00:14:50,519 --> 00:14:51,748
- Everyone regrets.
- Everyone does.

433
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:53,218
I made a huge mistake.

434
00:14:53,219 --> 00:14:54,959
I didn't expect short ribs.

435
00:14:55,059 --> 00:14:56,928
- I've never seen it.
- You just have to win.

436
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,128
(The eldest brother with a small appetite)

437
00:14:59,129 --> 00:15:02,599
(Short ribs are his rare favorite food.)

438
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:05,405
Do I cut the short ribs horizontally or vertically?

439
00:15:05,429 --> 00:15:06,469
How do we cut them?

440
00:15:06,599 --> 00:15:08,939
As you know, you cut it like this.

441
00:15:09,099 --> 00:15:10,968
The rice is...

442
00:15:10,969 --> 00:15:12,109
(That's enough.)

443
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,639
Look at this.

444
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:16,009
Hey, don't be provocative.

445
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:18,978
Goodness, stop it.

446
00:15:18,979 --> 00:15:22,478
Why do you keep being provocative?

447
00:15:22,479 --> 00:15:23,548
(Tae Hyun, that was very nice.)

448
00:15:23,549 --> 00:15:26,548
- It must be the signature dish.
- Thank you.

449
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:27,618
Thank you for the food.

450
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:30,189
(Yukgaltang, yukgaejang with a lot of short ribs)

451
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:33,699
The broth looks...

452
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:34,899
thick.

453
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:38,469
(He tastes a spoonful of the broth first.)

454
00:15:39,069 --> 00:15:40,169
(Exclaiming)

455
00:15:41,499 --> 00:15:43,509
Dong Hyun, the broth is very rich.

456
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:46,169
It's very rich and thick.

457
00:15:46,369 --> 00:15:47,409
Look at the broth.

458
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:53,209
(Thick)

459
00:15:56,549 --> 00:15:57,549
(Exclaiming)

460
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,819
How is it, Sang Uk?

461
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:04,728
It's richer and thicker than normal yukgaejang.

462
00:16:04,729 --> 00:16:06,088
(The broth is thicker than normal yukgaejang.)

463
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:08,198
It doesn't drip quickly.

464
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:09,999
To be exact, it has the texture of a soup.

465
00:16:11,229 --> 00:16:12,698
- Thick?
- The broth got reduced?

466
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:13,745
- The broth got reduced.
- Totally.

467
00:16:13,769 --> 00:16:15,168
I'm salivating buckets.

468
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:17,409
- There are 3 short ribs?
- There are 3 short ribs.

469
00:16:17,809 --> 00:16:19,508
I'll check to see if there are four.

470
00:16:19,509 --> 00:16:21,009
- No.
- Are there three?

471
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:25,648
(It's time to tear the meat from the short ribs.)

472
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:27,178
The bone comes off so easily.

473
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:28,978
- The bone is easily removed.
- It's easily removed.

474
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:31,289
I completely made a mistake.

475
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:38,389
(The meat is well cooked and tender.)

476
00:16:42,429 --> 00:16:45,028
(Humming)

477
00:16:45,029 --> 00:16:46,768
This is for me.

478
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:47,769
Se Yoon taught me this.

479
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:50,909
(Using the skill that he learned from Se Yoon)

480
00:16:51,439 --> 00:16:53,538
I thought that he was eating yukgaejang sushi.

481
00:16:53,539 --> 00:16:56,238
(I thought that he was eating sushi.)

482
00:16:56,239 --> 00:16:59,449
(With a sip of broth, it makes you exclaim in awe.)

483
00:16:59,609 --> 00:17:01,648
This is yukramyeon.

484
00:17:01,649 --> 00:17:06,119
(Soon, 2 types of ramyeon arrive.)

485
00:17:06,143 --> 00:17:08,152
How many types of noodles are in it?

486
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,082
- There's one type.
- Then how do the noodles...

487
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:12,252
- look like a mountain?
- This is tomato yukramyeon.

488
00:17:12,253 --> 00:17:14,223
- Gosh.
- Tomato yukramyeon.

489
00:17:15,353 --> 00:17:19,263
(Add shredded brisket to the same broth base.)

490
00:17:20,393 --> 00:17:23,963
(Special tomato sauce when yukgaejang starts to boil)

491
00:17:25,033 --> 00:17:27,314
(The yukgaejang turned more red because of the tomatoes.)

492
00:17:28,703 --> 00:17:33,603
(The second dish, tomato yukramyeon)

493
00:17:33,873 --> 00:17:35,542
In my opinion,

494
00:17:35,543 --> 00:17:39,512
there has been some delay in time.

495
00:17:39,513 --> 00:17:41,512
What do you mean? The food was served just now.

496
00:17:41,513 --> 00:17:43,183
- Exactly.
- The food was served late.

497
00:17:43,283 --> 00:17:44,553
How will you decide?

498
00:17:45,683 --> 00:17:46,883
Answer me when I'm being kind.

499
00:17:48,193 --> 00:17:49,752
- When you're being kind?
- He's about to turn the table over.

500
00:17:49,753 --> 00:17:50,962
(A polite demand for freeloading)

501
00:17:50,963 --> 00:17:52,822
Let me taste the ramyeon first.

502
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:53,932
Try the ramyeon too.

503
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:55,332
Hurry up and eat.

504
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,362
It looks like stir-fried ramyeon.

505
00:17:57,363 --> 00:18:02,073
(Noodles that look stir-fried in simmered broth)

506
00:18:03,803 --> 00:18:05,043
It smells like spaghetti.

507
00:18:14,613 --> 00:18:15,813
The ramyeon.

508
00:18:16,813 --> 00:18:18,523
It looks like ramyeon noodles in rabokki.

509
00:18:19,483 --> 00:18:21,293
- Tomato ramyeon.
- This is my favorite.

510
00:18:21,323 --> 00:18:23,092
- I love it.
- Gosh.

511
00:18:23,093 --> 00:18:25,423
I didn't think ramyeon would go well with tomatoes.

512
00:18:26,423 --> 00:18:29,063
It tastes like Korean-style spaghetti.

513
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:31,663
It's delicious.

514
00:18:32,133 --> 00:18:34,772
- Can I smell it?
- You can smell it for free.

515
00:18:34,773 --> 00:18:37,773
- You can smell it for free.
- It smells like...

516
00:18:37,973 --> 00:18:40,272
- Wait, you can't do that.
- Why not?

517
00:18:40,273 --> 00:18:41,912
You can only smell it for free.

518
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:43,673
- No, come near me.
- I won't steal it.

519
00:18:45,383 --> 00:18:47,852
It smells similar to a hamburger.

520
00:18:47,853 --> 00:18:50,383
It tastes like spaghetti with spicy tomato sauce.

521
00:18:52,253 --> 00:18:53,623
It has meat here too.

522
00:18:54,553 --> 00:18:56,592
- It has meat.
- Of course it does.

523
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,593
Look at the meat.

524
00:18:58,623 --> 00:19:00,192
It tastes like spaghetti...

525
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:01,593
at a convenience store.

526
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:04,462
The thick taste of yukgaejang is added.

527
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:05,463
(Grunting)

528
00:19:05,464 --> 00:19:07,473
- Young people would love it.
- This is amazing.

529
00:19:08,433 --> 00:19:09,933
It tastes like meat spaghetti.

530
00:19:09,973 --> 00:19:11,803
It's not spicy. It tastes very light.

531
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:13,543
It even has meat in it.

532
00:19:14,543 --> 00:19:16,213
Ever since I became a YouTuber,

533
00:19:16,743 --> 00:19:18,612
I ate whenever I was hungry.

534
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:20,882
That's what most people do.

535
00:19:20,883 --> 00:19:22,582
They usually don't do what we're doing.

536
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,982
I never suffered like this after the military.

537
00:19:24,983 --> 00:19:26,823
Even in the military, I ate when I was hungry.

538
00:19:26,853 --> 00:19:28,133
We met for the first time today.

539
00:19:29,123 --> 00:19:30,762
- Nice to meet you.
- Can you undo this?

540
00:19:30,763 --> 00:19:32,992
Please take it.

541
00:19:32,993 --> 00:19:34,469
(Appropriate table manners for the first meeting)

542
00:19:34,493 --> 00:19:35,493
It's hard to look.

543
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,263
I avoid looking it.

544
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:40,002
It has the Korean flavor of yukgaejang.

545
00:19:40,003 --> 00:19:41,072
Right.

546
00:19:41,073 --> 00:19:42,773
Tae Hyun would love it the most.

547
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:44,872
- And Pani Bottle.
- It's lighter than you think.

548
00:19:44,873 --> 00:19:46,043
I just noticed it.

549
00:19:47,573 --> 00:19:49,073
"Meal kits are sold online."

550
00:19:50,013 --> 00:19:51,013
There it is.

551
00:19:51,014 --> 00:19:52,743
(Meal kits are sold online.)

552
00:19:52,913 --> 00:19:54,113
Please brace yourself.

553
00:19:56,283 --> 00:19:58,122
(Warning of a huge order)

554
00:19:58,123 --> 00:19:59,553
I will start to move.

555
00:20:01,853 --> 00:20:04,792
(Without caring, Sang Uk is devouring.)

556
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:07,432
You won't finish the food, will you?

557
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:08,433
We'll order you one.

558
00:20:09,063 --> 00:20:11,333
Which 1 of the 2 do you prefer?

559
00:20:11,433 --> 00:20:13,702
Between tomato yukramyeon and...

560
00:20:13,703 --> 00:20:15,423
- I prefer the tomato yukramyeon.
- Tomato?

561
00:20:15,773 --> 00:20:17,343
I also like the tomato yukramyeon.

562
00:20:17,873 --> 00:20:19,743
Here's what I think.

563
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:22,113
The next restaurant we're going to sells western food.

564
00:20:22,373 --> 00:20:24,282
- There will be pasta there.
- Over there?

565
00:20:24,283 --> 00:20:25,912
At that restaurant, we can order...

566
00:20:25,913 --> 00:20:28,583
noodles made with tomato sauce.

567
00:20:29,283 --> 00:20:30,283
Okay.

568
00:20:30,284 --> 00:20:32,565
- It's completely different.
- It's completely different.

569
00:20:33,183 --> 00:20:35,192
- Completely different?
- It's completely different.

570
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:36,452
You can't compare them.

571
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:38,062
I'm curious about the yukramyeon.

572
00:20:38,063 --> 00:20:39,063
- Let's try the yukramyeon.
- Okay.

573
00:20:39,064 --> 00:20:41,393
- I'd like to know its taste.
- There's some left.

574
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:43,262
Can we get another tomato yukramyeon?

575
00:20:43,263 --> 00:20:44,603
(We make the decision.)

576
00:20:45,103 --> 00:20:46,103
What did I tell you?

577
00:20:46,104 --> 00:20:48,902
It's complete the proverb.

578
00:20:48,903 --> 00:20:49,903
Okay.

579
00:20:49,904 --> 00:20:53,273
This proverb expresses something ridiculous...

580
00:20:53,573 --> 00:20:56,443
and a sense of disbelief.

581
00:20:56,643 --> 00:20:58,943
"This would yawn."

582
00:21:01,283 --> 00:21:02,353
I've heard of this.

583
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:03,683
"This would yawn?"

584
00:21:03,853 --> 00:21:05,223
- Pani Bottle.
- Pani Bottle.

585
00:21:06,283 --> 00:21:07,693
A passing dog.

586
00:21:07,923 --> 00:21:08,952
Incorrect.

587
00:21:08,953 --> 00:21:10,662
He made a good guess.

588
00:21:10,663 --> 00:21:11,693
I agree.

589
00:21:12,423 --> 00:21:13,493
What could it be?

590
00:21:14,693 --> 00:21:16,263
Do you want a hint?

591
00:21:16,893 --> 00:21:18,262
- I'll give you a hint.
- You know the answer?

592
00:21:18,263 --> 00:21:19,363
It's not a living thing.

593
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:21,033
What is it?

594
00:21:21,103 --> 00:21:22,303
I don't know that far.

595
00:21:23,403 --> 00:21:25,872
You can't give us a hint if you don't know.

596
00:21:25,873 --> 00:21:29,042
- You have to know.
- Dong Hyun made...

597
00:21:29,043 --> 00:21:30,313
fun of us.

598
00:21:30,943 --> 00:21:32,643
It's a living being, isn't it?

599
00:21:32,883 --> 00:21:34,253
It's inside our body.

600
00:21:35,683 --> 00:21:36,813
I got it. The anus.

601
00:21:37,623 --> 00:21:39,383
- The anus?
- The anus is incorrect.

602
00:21:39,823 --> 00:21:40,992
It must be close.

603
00:21:40,993 --> 00:21:42,222
- The anus?
- He's good.

604
00:21:42,223 --> 00:21:43,753
Since it's ridiculous,

605
00:21:44,263 --> 00:21:46,063
we'd say, "The anus would laugh."

606
00:21:46,293 --> 00:21:48,193
- Is that it?
- Is it something similar?

607
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:50,393
I got it. Fart.

608
00:21:50,633 --> 00:21:52,033
A fart would yawn? Incorrect.

609
00:21:52,263 --> 00:21:53,433
I got it. The belly button.

610
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:56,432
The belly button is correct.

611
00:21:56,433 --> 00:21:57,873
(Answer: Belly button)

612
00:21:57,903 --> 00:21:59,003
That's correct.

613
00:21:59,103 --> 00:22:00,103
(Pani Bottle gets to freeload.)

614
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:02,113
He's good.

615
00:22:02,473 --> 00:22:03,513
You're good.

616
00:22:03,983 --> 00:22:09,183
(Warm tomato yukramyeon for freeloading)

617
00:22:09,753 --> 00:22:10,753
(Jealous)

618
00:22:10,753 --> 00:22:11,753
It smells like...

619
00:22:12,223 --> 00:22:14,152
Expose the noodles in the air.

620
00:22:14,153 --> 00:22:15,592
(Steaming)

621
00:22:15,593 --> 00:22:16,693
You only get one bite.

622
00:22:17,523 --> 00:22:19,592
(Warming up)

623
00:22:19,593 --> 00:22:22,592
My mouth is small, so I need to warm it up.

624
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:24,009
(The man with a small mouth goes for a big bite.)

625
00:22:24,033 --> 00:22:25,102
It's good to eat in one go.

626
00:22:25,103 --> 00:22:26,203
(Staring)

627
00:22:27,773 --> 00:22:31,072
Gosh, it's hot.

628
00:22:31,073 --> 00:22:33,402
- Endure it.
- Endure it.

629
00:22:33,403 --> 00:22:35,013
- Endure it.
- I told him to cool it.

630
00:22:35,273 --> 00:22:36,673
It must be really hot.

631
00:22:37,543 --> 00:22:38,642
Endure it.

632
00:22:38,643 --> 00:22:40,342
(He keeps eating it until the end.)

633
00:22:40,343 --> 00:22:42,312
- It isn't spicy, right?
- It's not spicy at all.

634
00:22:42,313 --> 00:22:43,653
It's just the color.

635
00:22:43,713 --> 00:22:44,722
It's delicious.

636
00:22:44,723 --> 00:22:46,253
- Right?
- It tastes light.

637
00:22:46,683 --> 00:22:48,452
It tastes like a fusion dish,

638
00:22:48,453 --> 00:22:49,653
- and it's very good.
- Right.

639
00:22:49,793 --> 00:22:51,663
The noodles are perfectly al dente.

640
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:53,523
They're neither soggy nor hard.

641
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:54,832
Since they're perfectly al dente,

642
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,262
- can we try one more time?
- If so,

643
00:22:56,263 --> 00:22:57,292
what do you want to do?

644
00:22:57,293 --> 00:22:59,762
In case I get to eat such delicious food again...

645
00:22:59,763 --> 00:23:00,979
You can play rock-paper-scissors.

646
00:23:01,003 --> 00:23:02,172
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- Play rock-paper-scissors...

647
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:04,073
- and lose on purpose.
- That works.

648
00:23:04,343 --> 00:23:05,943
- What will you play?
- Rock.

649
00:23:06,103 --> 00:23:07,172
- And...
- Rock for men.

650
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:08,472
If you win, you can eat.

651
00:23:08,473 --> 00:23:09,473
Okay.

652
00:23:09,474 --> 00:23:10,612
You swear it on your YouTube channel, okay?

653
00:23:10,613 --> 00:23:12,283
Why would you say that?

654
00:23:12,483 --> 00:23:13,712
- Why would I swear it on that?
- He shouldn't do that.

655
00:23:13,713 --> 00:23:15,182
I can't do that.

656
00:23:15,183 --> 00:23:17,252
- I'll trust him and play paper.
- Okay.

657
00:23:17,253 --> 00:23:18,553
I'll trust him and play paper.

658
00:23:18,953 --> 00:23:20,692
Ready or not,

659
00:23:20,693 --> 00:23:21,823
rock-paper-scissors.

660
00:23:22,353 --> 00:23:25,023
(I fooled you.)

661
00:23:25,393 --> 00:23:27,222
- Eat one more time.
- Everyone is so honest.

662
00:23:27,223 --> 00:23:28,233
- I mean...
- Seriously.

663
00:23:28,393 --> 00:23:29,632
- I'm sorry.
- You know what?

664
00:23:29,633 --> 00:23:31,162
He licked his lips before playing.

665
00:23:31,163 --> 00:23:32,303
He licked his lips.

666
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:34,672
I gave you a hint by saying that I can't swear it on my channel.

667
00:23:34,673 --> 00:23:36,472
- That's true.
- I gave you enough hint.

668
00:23:36,473 --> 00:23:37,742
Cool it since it's hot.

669
00:23:37,743 --> 00:23:39,502
(Jealous)

670
00:23:39,503 --> 00:23:40,503
Oh, yes.

671
00:23:42,113 --> 00:23:44,642
It looks like soup made with roe.

672
00:23:44,643 --> 00:23:45,742
(The world traveler knows how to adapt.)

673
00:23:45,743 --> 00:23:47,243
(Freeloading for the 2nd time)

674
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,143
I already ate, but it still looks good.

675
00:23:49,353 --> 00:23:50,613
He eats deliciously.

676
00:23:51,523 --> 00:23:53,683
Could you give us the bill?

677
00:23:53,783 --> 00:23:57,092
If Pani Bottle pays at the first restaurant,

678
00:23:57,093 --> 00:23:58,692
he'll get competitive fast.

679
00:23:58,693 --> 00:23:59,763
Of course.

680
00:23:59,993 --> 00:24:02,333
- Let's do it.
- The total isn't so bad.

681
00:24:02,593 --> 00:24:03,662
It's fine.

682
00:24:03,663 --> 00:24:04,732
- It's the lucky number.
- It's 88 dollars.

683
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:05,733
We had a lot.

684
00:24:05,734 --> 00:24:07,179
- We had a lot of food.
- One, two, three.

685
00:24:07,203 --> 00:24:08,903
We also ordered a bowl of rice.

686
00:24:09,003 --> 00:24:12,003
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz for a total of 88 dollars)

687
00:24:12,603 --> 00:24:14,772
Tomatoes are known to be nourishing...

688
00:24:14,773 --> 00:24:17,612
and good for stamina.

689
00:24:17,613 --> 00:24:19,894
- A question about tomatoes.
- I'm an expert on tomatoes.

690
00:24:20,043 --> 00:24:22,812
In the West, there's a saying, "As the tomato turns red,"

691
00:24:22,813 --> 00:24:26,153
"this person's face turns blue."

692
00:24:27,023 --> 00:24:29,123
(It sounds difficult.)

693
00:24:29,353 --> 00:24:30,693
Who is this person?

694
00:24:31,063 --> 00:24:32,592
- How would I know?
- Who is that person?

695
00:24:32,593 --> 00:24:33,792
Do we have to say his name?

696
00:24:33,793 --> 00:24:34,863
What is his name?

697
00:24:34,993 --> 00:24:37,193
- Should we say his name?
- Just tell us the last name.

698
00:24:37,263 --> 00:24:38,502
- What?
- Are there choices?

699
00:24:38,503 --> 00:24:39,633
Alfredo.

700
00:24:39,933 --> 00:24:41,473
Should I say someone's name...

701
00:24:41,603 --> 00:24:43,873
- or what?
- Maybe it isn't someone's name.

702
00:24:44,143 --> 00:24:45,742
It must be a title...

703
00:24:45,743 --> 00:24:47,072
- like "father." - Or a profession.

704
00:24:47,073 --> 00:24:48,712
- Or a profession.
- A profession or a title.

705
00:24:48,713 --> 00:24:50,273
(They reason it as a type of category.)

706
00:24:51,313 --> 00:24:53,582
(Tomato yukramyeon that Pani Bottle tasted)

707
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:56,053
As the tomato turns red, this person...

708
00:24:58,783 --> 00:24:59,823
In that case...

709
00:25:01,593 --> 00:25:03,723
(Eating quietly?)

710
00:25:07,093 --> 00:25:08,663
He's eating right in front of us.

711
00:25:09,433 --> 00:25:10,802
- Go ahead and eat.
- Don't film me.

712
00:25:10,803 --> 00:25:12,132
I'm eating secretly.

713
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:13,363
He's out of the frame, right?

714
00:25:13,463 --> 00:25:14,632
The viewers think that...

715
00:25:14,633 --> 00:25:15,879
- we're doing the quiz.
- We can still hear him eat.

716
00:25:15,903 --> 00:25:17,102
Blur his face.

717
00:25:17,103 --> 00:25:18,302
I'll eat as quietly as possible.

718
00:25:18,303 --> 00:25:20,043
- Blur his face.
- My goodness.

719
00:25:20,273 --> 00:25:21,342
Then give us a hint.

720
00:25:21,343 --> 00:25:22,812
- Since we're letting you eat, - Give us a hint.

721
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,533
- tell us what you think.
- Give us a hint.

722
00:25:24,843 --> 00:25:27,083
Pani Bottle and I think it's this.

723
00:25:27,243 --> 00:25:28,713
It must be a type of profession.

724
00:25:29,113 --> 00:25:30,513
(I know!)

725
00:25:30,653 --> 00:25:32,483
Could it be the owner of an eel restaurant?

726
00:25:33,853 --> 00:25:35,733
There's no eel restaurant in western countries.

727
00:25:36,253 --> 00:25:37,853
If it's nourishing and good for stamina,

728
00:25:38,963 --> 00:25:40,593
the wife at every home...

729
00:25:41,033 --> 00:25:42,793
The husbands suffer more.

730
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:44,302
In that case,

731
00:25:44,303 --> 00:25:46,132
isn't the husband the answer?

732
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:48,102
The husband should have a harder time.

733
00:25:48,103 --> 00:25:49,233
Men?

734
00:25:49,373 --> 00:25:52,072
I also thought about doctors.

735
00:25:52,073 --> 00:25:53,242
(Suggesting quietly)

736
00:25:53,243 --> 00:25:55,172
Since tomatoes are nourishing,

737
00:25:55,173 --> 00:25:56,312
people won't die easily.

738
00:25:56,313 --> 00:25:57,783
- Doctors or undertakers.
- Stop.

739
00:25:57,843 --> 00:25:59,713
- The answer must be doctor.
- Stop.

740
00:25:59,843 --> 00:26:00,983
- It's doctor.
- Hey.

741
00:26:01,213 --> 00:26:03,853
As people get healthy, they don't go to the hospital.

742
00:26:04,083 --> 00:26:05,282
Doctor sounds reasonable.

743
00:26:05,283 --> 00:26:06,822
- Doctor.
- Let's do it right away.

744
00:26:06,823 --> 00:26:07,823
It's doctor.

745
00:26:07,824 --> 00:26:09,322
- But it could be wrong.
- It's doctor.

746
00:26:09,323 --> 00:26:10,323
It could be wrong.

747
00:26:10,324 --> 00:26:11,962
If the answer is doctor, you gave them the answer.

748
00:26:11,963 --> 00:26:13,193
It feels like...

749
00:26:13,423 --> 00:26:14,783
Pani Bottle, shout out the answer.

750
00:26:15,893 --> 00:26:17,762
While taking out your credit card,

751
00:26:17,763 --> 00:26:19,432
- you can call out the answer.
- Doctor.

752
00:26:19,433 --> 00:26:21,233
Let's go with doctor in English.

753
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:22,973
All right.

754
00:26:23,203 --> 00:26:25,149
Let's shout it at the same time. One, two, three.

755
00:26:25,173 --> 00:26:26,173
- Doctor.
- Doctor.

756
00:26:26,443 --> 00:26:27,443
Doctor?

757
00:26:27,973 --> 00:26:29,042
(No way...)

758
00:26:29,043 --> 00:26:31,012
- Doctor?
- I think that it's the wife.

759
00:26:31,013 --> 00:26:32,042
(Answer: Doctor)

760
00:26:32,043 --> 00:26:33,113
Correct.

761
00:26:34,983 --> 00:26:35,983
Correct.

762
00:26:36,483 --> 00:26:37,512
See that?

763
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,682
(Pani Bottle's suicidal move)

764
00:26:38,683 --> 00:26:40,122
- I'll pay.
- I love you.

765
00:26:40,123 --> 00:26:41,222
Is doctor the answer?

766
00:26:41,223 --> 00:26:43,183
- I love you, Pani Bottle.
- Is it really doctor?

767
00:26:43,623 --> 00:26:46,063
I was feeling frustrated,

768
00:26:46,193 --> 00:26:48,569
- but when he mentioned "doctor..." - He cleared the path for us.

769
00:26:48,593 --> 00:26:49,793
Pani Bottle!

770
00:26:50,163 --> 00:26:52,032
- Seriously.
- I love you, Pani Bottle.

771
00:26:52,033 --> 00:26:53,932
- What have you done?
- The answer is doctor.

772
00:26:53,933 --> 00:26:55,602
- We were exactly right.
- Why did I do that?

773
00:26:55,603 --> 00:26:57,002
(The bill is on Team Lasagna.)

774
00:26:57,003 --> 00:26:58,073
- Here you go.
- Right.

775
00:26:58,773 --> 00:27:00,943
It became clear as soon as I heard it.

776
00:27:01,473 --> 00:27:02,513
Seriously.

777
00:27:03,243 --> 00:27:04,583
There are two answers.

778
00:27:04,783 --> 00:27:06,282
- The 1st one to say...
- You have to say it 1st.

779
00:27:06,283 --> 00:27:08,652
- the correct answer is exempted.
- You're out.

780
00:27:08,653 --> 00:27:10,313
The one who fails to answer has to pay.

781
00:27:10,683 --> 00:27:14,183
There's a popular children's song about tomatoes.

782
00:27:14,353 --> 00:27:15,553
It's about tomatoes again.

783
00:27:15,823 --> 00:27:17,292
It's called "Tomato Song."

784
00:27:17,293 --> 00:27:18,662
- Amazing tomato - Tomato

785
00:27:18,663 --> 00:27:20,322
- My children sing it so many times.
- Tomato

786
00:27:20,323 --> 00:27:22,093
I'll play the song.

787
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:23,933
I memorized all the lyrics.

788
00:27:24,463 --> 00:27:26,232
I know them too. I just have to listen to it.

789
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:29,232
(With a curvy, stunning figure)

790
00:27:29,233 --> 00:27:32,472
(Wearing a red outfit)

791
00:27:32,473 --> 00:27:36,442
(Giving off sweet and sour fragrance)

792
00:27:36,443 --> 00:27:39,612
(Amazing tomato, tomato)

793
00:27:39,613 --> 00:27:41,213
- I...
- I got it.

794
00:27:42,653 --> 00:27:44,052
- Do I just answer one of them?
- Yes.

795
00:27:44,053 --> 00:27:45,123
Ketchup.

796
00:27:45,923 --> 00:27:46,952
Ketchup?

797
00:27:46,953 --> 00:27:48,122
(Answer: I will become ketchup)

798
00:27:48,123 --> 00:27:50,753
- Shin Seung Ho is correct.
- Right.

799
00:27:51,263 --> 00:27:53,193
- I will become ketchup - I will become ketchup

800
00:27:53,793 --> 00:27:55,163
Now that I said ketchup,

801
00:27:55,393 --> 00:27:57,393
there's only one more possibility.

802
00:27:57,463 --> 00:28:00,033
- You're right.
- All right.

803
00:28:00,133 --> 00:28:02,373
(What is there other than ketchup?)

804
00:28:02,773 --> 00:28:05,043
- Tomato patty.
- Typical food made with tomatoes.

805
00:28:05,403 --> 00:28:06,973
- I think this is...
- I got it.

806
00:28:07,473 --> 00:28:09,412
- Juice.
- Juice is correct.

807
00:28:09,413 --> 00:28:11,783
(Correct!)

808
00:28:12,183 --> 00:28:14,082
That's correct.

809
00:28:14,083 --> 00:28:15,482
(Pani Bottle has to pay.)

810
00:28:15,483 --> 00:28:16,682
You know what I was about to say?

811
00:28:16,683 --> 00:28:17,753
Salted.

812
00:28:18,183 --> 00:28:19,353
Salted tomatoes.

813
00:28:19,553 --> 00:28:21,392
Pani Bottle, this is a children's song.

814
00:28:21,393 --> 00:28:22,653
Salted tomatoes sound tasty.

815
00:28:23,753 --> 00:28:25,393
(I will become salted)

816
00:28:25,993 --> 00:28:27,122
I didn't think of juice.

817
00:28:27,123 --> 00:28:28,892
(Embarrassed)

818
00:28:28,893 --> 00:28:31,463
Things are turning out the way I predicted.

819
00:28:32,533 --> 00:28:35,233
Based on my prediction, you'll also pay at the second restaurant.

820
00:28:36,103 --> 00:28:37,372
I hope that...

821
00:28:37,373 --> 00:28:39,402
I'm sorry, but I'm not that fun.

822
00:28:39,403 --> 00:28:40,542
- Really?
- It won't be fun,

823
00:28:40,543 --> 00:28:41,772
but I'll get it right the second time.

824
00:28:41,773 --> 00:28:43,573
Anyway, I'll pay for it.

825
00:28:44,043 --> 00:28:46,543
- Thank you, Jae Han.
- Thank you for the food.

826
00:28:46,843 --> 00:28:48,313
Thank you for the food.

827
00:28:49,113 --> 00:28:50,113
I ate so well.

828
00:28:50,283 --> 00:28:52,253
It was a good meal.

829
00:28:52,483 --> 00:28:53,623
He really swiped my card.

830
00:28:54,123 --> 00:28:55,423
He really swiped it.

831
00:28:57,523 --> 00:28:59,443
- Wasn't it delicious?
- Thank you, Pani Bottle.

832
00:28:59,523 --> 00:29:01,093
- I feel great.
- Me too.

833
00:29:01,963 --> 00:29:03,532
This path didn't exist...

834
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,462
- when you were living here, right?
- When I was in school,

835
00:29:05,463 --> 00:29:07,462
- this was a railway.
- A railway?

836
00:29:07,463 --> 00:29:10,673
If you followed this path, you'd reach my house.

837
00:29:10,933 --> 00:29:12,303
It was on Gyeongchun Line.

838
00:29:14,373 --> 00:29:16,272
(Now, it's Gyeongchun Line Forest Trail.)

839
00:29:16,273 --> 00:29:18,313
(A quiet resting area for the residents)

840
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:21,982
The old red brick houses among new buildings...

841
00:29:21,983 --> 00:29:23,353
give a nice vibe.

842
00:29:23,453 --> 00:29:25,553
- Houses made with red bricks.
- Yes.

843
00:29:25,823 --> 00:29:27,183
Foreigners like them.

844
00:29:27,523 --> 00:29:29,392
We don't notice them because we see them every day.

845
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:30,522
We don't realize the charm,

846
00:29:30,523 --> 00:29:33,392
but foreigners like this alley vibe.

847
00:29:33,393 --> 00:29:35,693
(The Korean alley scene is more popular abroad.)

848
00:29:37,493 --> 00:29:41,303
(A time when our ordinary life is romanticized by foreigners)

849
00:29:42,773 --> 00:29:43,802
(Vroom)

850
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:45,603
Isn't it the sound of the disinfection truck?

851
00:29:45,643 --> 00:29:46,673
Oh, my.

852
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:48,473
- Is it the mosquito control truck?
- Right.

853
00:29:48,673 --> 00:29:49,742
My goodness.

854
00:29:49,743 --> 00:29:51,023
We saw it when we were children.

855
00:29:51,643 --> 00:29:53,343
The smoke isn't as strong as before.

856
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:55,682
In the past, it was blinding.

857
00:29:55,683 --> 00:29:57,113
Shall we smell it?

858
00:29:57,823 --> 00:29:58,823
(They can't believe that they're seeing it here.)

859
00:29:58,824 --> 00:30:00,053
Is the smell the same?

860
00:30:00,523 --> 00:30:01,753
Shall we go and smell it?

861
00:30:04,623 --> 00:30:05,763
You have to run after it.

862
00:30:12,033 --> 00:30:14,473
(The place is full of nostalgic scenes.)

863
00:30:14,973 --> 00:30:16,503
There's a traditional market.

864
00:30:16,873 --> 00:30:18,873
If you like to drink... There it is.

865
00:30:19,803 --> 00:30:21,912
- Here it is.
- This place is...

866
00:30:21,913 --> 00:30:23,842
I didn't expect to see a traditional market here,

867
00:30:23,843 --> 00:30:25,682
- but there is one.
- On the hill.

868
00:30:25,683 --> 00:30:27,089
(Every alley is filled with nostalgic sights.)

869
00:30:27,113 --> 00:30:30,212
Taking a look around makes me realize...

870
00:30:30,213 --> 00:30:32,452
why this is known as a popular spot.

871
00:30:32,453 --> 00:30:33,852
- A lot of people would come here.
- It has a good vibe.

872
00:30:33,853 --> 00:30:34,923
I agree.

873
00:30:34,993 --> 00:30:37,253
- I can smell the lasagna.
- You can?

874
00:30:37,393 --> 00:30:38,663
"Pasta" is written over there.

875
00:30:39,623 --> 00:30:41,863
It looks much smaller and cozier than I expected.

876
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:45,133
Hello.

877
00:30:45,903 --> 00:30:48,272
This sticker certifies that it's a tasty restaurant.

878
00:30:48,273 --> 00:30:50,873
(A small western food restaurant welcomes with colorful ribbons.)

879
00:30:51,443 --> 00:30:55,573
(The cute signboard catches our attention.)

880
00:30:56,143 --> 00:30:59,413
(It's a small restaurant hidden in a residential area.)

881
00:31:01,983 --> 00:31:03,452
("If you want pasta in Gongneung, I recommend this place.")

882
00:31:03,453 --> 00:31:04,852
("I can see why it received the Blue Ribbon.")

883
00:31:04,853 --> 00:31:07,013
("It's small and cozy, but the taste isn't ordinary.")

884
00:31:07,253 --> 00:31:12,323
(LMR 2, lasagna)

885
00:31:12,523 --> 00:31:15,532
The chef must be extremely sincere...

886
00:31:15,533 --> 00:31:17,933
about his love for making pasta.

887
00:31:18,803 --> 00:31:20,462
(Let's see.)

888
00:31:20,463 --> 00:31:22,302
Garlic and eggplant oil pasta sounds good.

889
00:31:22,303 --> 00:31:25,602
Don't these look similar?

890
00:31:25,603 --> 00:31:27,302
He must have three children.

891
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:28,913
I think he has two children.

892
00:31:29,173 --> 00:31:30,412
- I think this is dad.
- You're right.

893
00:31:30,413 --> 00:31:31,413
Right?

894
00:31:31,813 --> 00:31:32,983
They're brother and sister.

895
00:31:33,143 --> 00:31:36,753
The daughter looks older than the son.

896
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:41,082
- I'll give you water first.
- Hello.

897
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,153
By the way...

898
00:31:42,393 --> 00:31:44,252
- It's you.
- Yes, I'm the owner.

899
00:31:44,253 --> 00:31:45,863
- Do you have two children?
- Yes.

900
00:31:46,293 --> 00:31:47,893
- A son and a daughter?
- They're twins.

901
00:31:47,963 --> 00:31:50,263
What? I didn't know that.

902
00:31:50,933 --> 00:31:52,802
So they're twins.

903
00:31:52,803 --> 00:31:54,733
It looks like...

904
00:31:55,173 --> 00:31:57,472
- you received many ribbons.
- That's amazing.

905
00:31:57,473 --> 00:31:59,773
Did you study how to make pasta?

906
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:03,172
- I studied western cooking.
- I see.

907
00:32:03,173 --> 00:32:05,642
I worked at S Hotel...

908
00:32:05,643 --> 00:32:07,712
in Jangchung-dong for 15 years.

909
00:32:07,713 --> 00:32:09,652
- Oh, my.
- S Hotel?

910
00:32:09,653 --> 00:32:10,682
My goodness.

911
00:32:10,683 --> 00:32:12,259
- That's a fancy place.
- It's game over.

912
00:32:12,283 --> 00:32:14,229
If he worked at S Hotel in Jangchung-dong, it's game over.

913
00:32:14,253 --> 00:32:18,192
Then how did you end up in Gongneung-dong?

914
00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:20,392
I wanted to start my own restaurant.

915
00:32:20,393 --> 00:32:22,633
Since I live near here,

916
00:32:23,163 --> 00:32:25,633
after commuting to work from Gongneung-dong,

917
00:32:26,003 --> 00:32:27,563
I opened a restaurant of my own.

918
00:32:27,903 --> 00:32:29,402
It was also the case for the yukgaejang restaurant.

919
00:32:29,403 --> 00:32:31,942
It's a neighborhood where many people feel the urge to return.

920
00:32:31,943 --> 00:32:33,973
After living here, I can tell...

921
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,572
that people who were raised here or lived here for a long time...

922
00:32:36,573 --> 00:32:37,812
won't be moving anywhere else.

923
00:32:37,813 --> 00:32:39,942
Gongneung is a good place to live,

924
00:32:39,943 --> 00:32:41,082
especially because it's quiet.

925
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:43,313
Is this place close to the university?

926
00:32:43,353 --> 00:32:45,782
- I say it's reachable.
- I see.

927
00:32:45,783 --> 00:32:48,652
There are Seoul Tech students who come here by themselves,

928
00:32:48,653 --> 00:32:49,692
and we have seats for those who eat alone.

929
00:32:49,693 --> 00:32:52,463
- Students at Seoul Tech?
- I ate alone a lot in college too.

930
00:32:52,793 --> 00:32:57,833
(A place where locals can fill their hearts and stomachs)

931
00:32:59,163 --> 00:33:01,132
Seung Ho should order now.

932
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:02,573
- Have you made up your mind?
- Yes.

933
00:33:02,773 --> 00:33:05,703
We'll take one truffle and mushroom cream pasta,

934
00:33:05,743 --> 00:33:07,342
mashed potato and cheese lasagna,

935
00:33:07,343 --> 00:33:08,842
and two tenderloin chop steak.

936
00:33:08,843 --> 00:33:10,172
We'll order that for now.

937
00:33:10,173 --> 00:33:12,242
On our way here, we saw...

938
00:33:12,243 --> 00:33:13,412
the red ribbon.

939
00:33:13,413 --> 00:33:14,442
- Right.
- There's one behind you.

940
00:33:14,443 --> 00:33:15,612
The red ribbon mark.

941
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:17,752
Blue Ribbon collaborated with Coca Cola...

942
00:33:17,753 --> 00:33:19,723
to create this,

943
00:33:20,023 --> 00:33:21,222
which is awarded to tasty restaurants.

944
00:33:21,223 --> 00:33:22,223
Red ribbon.

945
00:33:22,224 --> 00:33:24,192
This pasta place was awarded the blue ribbon,

946
00:33:24,193 --> 00:33:26,093
and now the red ribbon.

947
00:33:26,723 --> 00:33:28,062
We have coke with even Korean food,

948
00:33:28,063 --> 00:33:29,332
so how can we have Western food without it?

949
00:33:29,333 --> 00:33:30,333
- Exactly.
- Of course.

950
00:33:30,334 --> 00:33:32,803
As for our beverage,

951
00:33:32,903 --> 00:33:34,703
- we'll take six cans of Coke Zero.
- Got it.

952
00:33:34,733 --> 00:33:35,802
Thank you.

953
00:33:35,803 --> 00:33:38,002
That'll shortly double.

954
00:33:38,003 --> 00:33:39,523
(They even ordered a refreshing soda!)

955
00:33:40,043 --> 00:33:43,673
(Right away, in the kitchen)

956
00:33:46,043 --> 00:33:48,552
(Truffle and mushroom cream pasta, )

957
00:33:48,553 --> 00:33:51,083
(rich with mushroom flavors, is being cooked first!)

958
00:33:56,353 --> 00:34:01,223
(The tenderloin chop steak gets cooked simultaneously!)

959
00:34:05,563 --> 00:34:06,602
- It's here.
- Here we go.

960
00:34:06,603 --> 00:34:08,372
Here's your order.

961
00:34:08,373 --> 00:34:10,333
This is the mushroom cream pasta.

962
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,303
It's S Hotel quality.

963
00:34:13,173 --> 00:34:15,312
(Rich and deep! Truffle and mushroom cream pasta)

964
00:34:15,313 --> 00:34:16,612
Here you go.

965
00:34:16,613 --> 00:34:18,712
- Here's your tenderloin chop steak.
- Chop steak!

966
00:34:18,713 --> 00:34:19,983
That smells incredible.

967
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:21,812
This is authentic for sure.

968
00:34:21,813 --> 00:34:24,052
(Juicy and seasoned perfectly! Tenderloin chop steak)

969
00:34:24,053 --> 00:34:25,882
There's something I forgot to tell you.

970
00:34:25,883 --> 00:34:28,522
We only serve tenderloin from Australia.

971
00:34:28,523 --> 00:34:30,322
- I see.
- Is there a reason for that?

972
00:34:30,323 --> 00:34:33,523
Others serve top blade or chuck flap tail,

973
00:34:33,623 --> 00:34:34,623
but tenderloin is better.

974
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:37,292
- It's huge.
- The whisper...

975
00:34:37,293 --> 00:34:38,763
made it sound credible.

976
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:42,133
- "But tenderloin is better." - This does look good.

977
00:34:42,503 --> 00:34:44,272
- Go ahead, guys.
- Let's eat.

978
00:34:44,273 --> 00:34:45,373
(Time to verify the taste!)

979
00:34:46,303 --> 00:34:47,543
You guys are lucky.

980
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,812
(A huge mouthful)

981
00:34:52,813 --> 00:34:54,913
I'll start with the meat.

982
00:34:55,953 --> 00:34:57,013
How is it?

983
00:34:57,813 --> 00:34:59,723
It's so good that I'm speechless.

984
00:34:59,923 --> 00:35:00,953
I mean it.

985
00:35:01,923 --> 00:35:05,463
(Seung Ho tries a mouthful of it too.)

986
00:35:07,623 --> 00:35:09,493
(That's what I'm talking about.)

987
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:10,793
(My gosh)

988
00:35:12,003 --> 00:35:13,803
- That's so nice.
- The truffle...

989
00:35:14,103 --> 00:35:16,972
isn't overpowering, and he added just the right amount.

990
00:35:16,973 --> 00:35:18,403
Did he drizzle truffle oil?

991
00:35:19,003 --> 00:35:20,502
I can smell the mushrooms too.

992
00:35:20,503 --> 00:35:22,112
(The delicious mushroom aroma filled his mouth.)

993
00:35:22,113 --> 00:35:23,613
- I want...
- This is the real deal.

994
00:35:23,843 --> 00:35:25,112
To stick my face in there...

995
00:35:25,113 --> 00:35:27,643
and rub the sauce all over my face.

996
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,682
I mean it. I really do.

997
00:35:29,683 --> 00:35:31,922
(It's funny but cute.)

998
00:35:31,923 --> 00:35:33,753
Only Seung Ho would say it like that.

999
00:35:34,183 --> 00:35:36,399
The smell of the truffle is overpowering in some dishes,

1000
00:35:36,423 --> 00:35:37,722
and truffle is all you can taste with some dishes.

1001
00:35:37,723 --> 00:35:40,163
- This has the perfect balance.
- It's perfect.

1002
00:35:40,723 --> 00:35:42,993
Out of all the pasta places I've been to,

1003
00:35:43,463 --> 00:35:45,702
this is definitely...

1004
00:35:45,703 --> 00:35:46,803
the best.

1005
00:35:47,203 --> 00:35:48,332
- Really?
- Out of all pasta places.

1006
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:49,832
The smell of it is different.

1007
00:35:49,833 --> 00:35:51,332
This serves the best pasta.

1008
00:35:51,333 --> 00:35:53,273
I should share this with the family.

1009
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,342
I need to share this.

1010
00:35:55,343 --> 00:35:56,642
(He immediately shares it with his family.)

1011
00:35:56,643 --> 00:35:57,672
I can't believe...

1012
00:35:57,673 --> 00:35:59,482
you can find such high-quality pasta...

1013
00:35:59,483 --> 00:36:01,283
at a small alley restaurant.

1014
00:36:01,913 --> 00:36:03,793
I would've never dreamed of it back in college.

1015
00:36:04,053 --> 00:36:05,953
I guarantee you that this isn't enough.

1016
00:36:05,983 --> 00:36:07,652
They'll definitely order another dish.

1017
00:36:07,653 --> 00:36:09,423
The pasta is delicious,

1018
00:36:09,493 --> 00:36:11,493
but it's even better with coke.

1019
00:36:11,993 --> 00:36:13,593
It washes everything down.

1020
00:36:13,893 --> 00:36:15,363
- It cleanses your palate.
- Right.

1021
00:36:15,393 --> 00:36:17,063
This completes the meal.

1022
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:18,862
(Envious)

1023
00:36:18,863 --> 00:36:20,463
Try the chop steak.

1024
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:25,643
(Next, they have the tenderloin chop steak.)

1025
00:36:26,043 --> 00:36:27,103
The chop steak.

1026
00:36:27,803 --> 00:36:28,812
Let's try the steak.

1027
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:30,853
(Pani Bottle cools it down and tries a bite first.)

1028
00:36:31,443 --> 00:36:32,443
(Tae Hyun tries a bite too.)

1029
00:36:32,444 --> 00:36:33,813
It's even better with the coke.

1030
00:36:34,953 --> 00:36:37,483
(Meat-lover Seung Ho tries a bite as well.)

1031
00:36:37,783 --> 00:36:40,553
(Eyes opening wide)

1032
00:36:41,053 --> 00:36:42,352
That looks so good.

1033
00:36:42,353 --> 00:36:44,553
I'd love a piece of that steak.

1034
00:36:44,963 --> 00:36:46,162
It's been cooked perfectly.

1035
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:49,733
It was cooked perfectly, just before it became too chewy.

1036
00:36:49,893 --> 00:36:51,032
It's not chewy at all.

1037
00:36:51,033 --> 00:36:54,463
(The meat is tender and cooked perfectly.)

1038
00:36:56,333 --> 00:36:58,242
Here's your lasagna.

1039
00:36:58,243 --> 00:36:59,642
- So that's the lasagna.
- Hold on.

1040
00:36:59,643 --> 00:37:00,749
- What's this?
- What's this?

1041
00:37:00,773 --> 00:37:03,012
It looks like a hamburger patty.

1042
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,342
(Focused)

1043
00:37:04,343 --> 00:37:06,612
Does this normally have so many layers?

1044
00:37:06,613 --> 00:37:09,013
It looks like something you'd get at a restaurant in the US.

1045
00:37:09,113 --> 00:37:10,182
Visually, I mean.

1046
00:37:10,183 --> 00:37:11,983
The sauce looks fancy.

1047
00:37:12,583 --> 00:37:14,303
I've never seen a lasagna like this before.

1048
00:37:15,523 --> 00:37:20,163
(A layer of tomato sauce, a single layer of lasagna sheets)

1049
00:37:20,963 --> 00:37:24,493
(A heap of meat sauce made from scratch)

1050
00:37:25,963 --> 00:37:30,173
(Bechamel sauce and cheese!)

1051
00:37:32,003 --> 00:37:37,013
(This process is repeated four times.)

1052
00:37:38,243 --> 00:37:42,953
(After cooking it in the oven, it's left to sit for a day!)

1053
00:37:43,413 --> 00:37:46,183
(The dish that is rich in content requires a lot of work.)

1054
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:51,253
(That's why it's so good. Mashed potato and cheese lasagna)

1055
00:37:51,763 --> 00:37:54,393
It's topped with aligot...

1056
00:37:54,493 --> 00:37:56,693
which is a potato dish with cheese.

1057
00:37:56,793 --> 00:37:57,962
Enjoy it with the lasagna.

1058
00:37:57,963 --> 00:37:59,579
I thought it was a puree, but it's cheese.

1059
00:37:59,603 --> 00:38:01,003
It's not your normal cheese?

1060
00:38:02,703 --> 00:38:06,403
(Why don't I try some?)

1061
00:38:08,513 --> 00:38:09,812
(Hey, it's really potatoes.)

1062
00:38:09,813 --> 00:38:11,682
- It's really potatoes.
- Yes, it's a potato dish.

1063
00:38:11,683 --> 00:38:13,243
It's a French potato dish.

1064
00:38:13,343 --> 00:38:15,483
With this lasagna, you get to enjoy two dishes.

1065
00:38:16,153 --> 00:38:18,252
- It's potatoes, not cheese.
- Cheese...

1066
00:38:18,253 --> 00:38:20,553
- It doesn't taste like cheese.
- More like potatoes.

1067
00:38:20,953 --> 00:38:22,623
It's like a pasta pie.

1068
00:38:23,353 --> 00:38:26,223
Does the sauce taste like that of meatball pasta?

1069
00:38:26,623 --> 00:38:27,822
- Yes, it's similar.
- That's right.

1070
00:38:27,823 --> 00:38:30,593
But the sauce isn't too heavy.

1071
00:38:31,293 --> 00:38:35,103
(Familiar flavors but mild)

1072
00:38:36,033 --> 00:38:39,143
(Seung Ho tries a bite.)

1073
00:38:39,803 --> 00:38:42,342
(Joy bubbles up involuntarily.)

1074
00:38:42,343 --> 00:38:43,673
This is so good...

1075
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:46,182
that I could keep eating this.

1076
00:38:46,183 --> 00:38:47,383
(I could keep eating this.)

1077
00:38:47,443 --> 00:38:48,612
The flavors are pleasant.

1078
00:38:48,613 --> 00:38:49,682
- It's seasoned perfectly.
- Right.

1079
00:38:49,683 --> 00:38:50,859
(Mild flavors that make you want more)

1080
00:38:50,883 --> 00:38:53,182
I should let it cool down...

1081
00:38:53,183 --> 00:38:55,423
and have some more later on.

1082
00:38:56,093 --> 00:38:57,252
- Now...
- Right.

1083
00:38:57,253 --> 00:38:59,263
(So, now...)

1084
00:38:59,693 --> 00:39:00,892
(Tsk)

1085
00:39:00,893 --> 00:39:02,663
Or maybe not.

1086
00:39:02,933 --> 00:39:04,593
I'll have some more.

1087
00:39:04,793 --> 00:39:06,702
Can't we have some?

1088
00:39:06,703 --> 00:39:08,032
The pasta... What was this again?

1089
00:39:08,033 --> 00:39:09,633
The aroma of truffle is inviting.

1090
00:39:09,703 --> 00:39:10,902
I wouldn't mind some rice in that.

1091
00:39:10,903 --> 00:39:12,203
Doesn't that smell incredible?

1092
00:39:12,743 --> 00:39:14,473
- Can we freeload?
- Can we freeload?

1093
00:39:14,543 --> 00:39:17,373
Pani Bottle, you travel around the world a lot,

1094
00:39:17,513 --> 00:39:20,482
so are there any fun facts that you've picked up?

1095
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,512
Some countries have fascinating customs.

1096
00:39:22,513 --> 00:39:24,252
Table manners, for example.

1097
00:39:24,253 --> 00:39:26,682
A question for the three of you?

1098
00:39:26,683 --> 00:39:28,692
- Maybe there's a fun fact.
- Can I ask the question?

1099
00:39:28,693 --> 00:39:29,752
- Yes.
- Of course.

1100
00:39:29,753 --> 00:39:31,122
- It's just for the three of them.
- It's to see who freeloads.

1101
00:39:31,123 --> 00:39:32,843
- It's for the freeloaders.
- Ask anything.

1102
00:39:33,263 --> 00:39:35,863
There's something that fascinated me recently.

1103
00:39:35,993 --> 00:39:37,693
In Saudi Arabia...

1104
00:39:38,163 --> 00:39:39,562
- Are you asking a question?
- I am.

1105
00:39:39,563 --> 00:39:41,102
They don't have this in restrooms.

1106
00:39:41,103 --> 00:39:42,132
(Pani Bottle asks the question based on his experience.)

1107
00:39:42,133 --> 00:39:43,493
What don't they have in restrooms?

1108
00:39:44,503 --> 00:39:46,072
They don't have this in restrooms.

1109
00:39:46,073 --> 00:39:47,193
- In Saudi Arabia.
- I know.

1110
00:39:47,573 --> 00:39:49,113
- Doors?
- Incorrect.

1111
00:39:49,443 --> 00:39:51,072
- No doors?
- You might...

1112
00:39:51,073 --> 00:39:52,782
have to go into doorless stalls.

1113
00:39:52,783 --> 00:39:54,242
(You can still go even if it doesn't have a door.)

1114
00:39:54,243 --> 00:39:55,282
I know.

1115
00:39:55,283 --> 00:39:56,312
A toilet.

1116
00:39:56,313 --> 00:39:58,382
(Yi Kyung: A toilet)

1117
00:39:58,383 --> 00:39:59,753
- That's half correct.
- I know.

1118
00:40:00,653 --> 00:40:01,752
- I know.
- I know.

1119
00:40:01,753 --> 00:40:02,753
(I know!)

1120
00:40:02,754 --> 00:40:04,323
He was quicker.

1121
00:40:05,463 --> 00:40:06,863
A toilet seat?

1122
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:08,393
A toilet seat?

1123
00:40:08,593 --> 00:40:09,692
- Incorrect.
- I know.

1124
00:40:09,693 --> 00:40:11,462
It's my turn. A urinal.

1125
00:40:11,463 --> 00:40:12,603
Correct!

1126
00:40:12,933 --> 00:40:14,402
- Correct!
- I see.

1127
00:40:14,403 --> 00:40:16,703
- Don't they have urinals?
- It's like this.

1128
00:40:16,773 --> 00:40:18,402
They only have toilets.

1129
00:40:18,403 --> 00:40:20,773
They don't have any urinals in restrooms.

1130
00:40:21,713 --> 00:40:23,242
Not even in airports.

1131
00:40:23,243 --> 00:40:24,613
Not even airports?

1132
00:40:25,513 --> 00:40:26,982
- Can I eat now?
- Sure.

1133
00:40:26,983 --> 00:40:28,413
(Excited)

1134
00:40:28,713 --> 00:40:29,983
Even the bread is good.

1135
00:40:30,383 --> 00:40:33,023
I dipped it in the sauce, and it was amazing.

1136
00:40:34,883 --> 00:40:36,952
I didn't know truffle went so well in pasta.

1137
00:40:36,953 --> 00:40:38,152
(All in one mouthful)

1138
00:40:38,153 --> 00:40:39,369
How can you not try that instead?

1139
00:40:39,393 --> 00:40:40,423
(Yummy)

1140
00:40:40,493 --> 00:40:41,892
How's the richness?

1141
00:40:41,893 --> 00:40:43,293
Exhale through the nose.

1142
00:40:43,333 --> 00:40:44,362
(Inhaling)

1143
00:40:44,363 --> 00:40:45,432
(Chocking)

1144
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:46,863
(What are you doing?)

1145
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,932
- What was that?
- You should breathe out the smell,

1146
00:40:48,933 --> 00:40:50,002
not spit the noodles out.

1147
00:40:50,003 --> 00:40:51,103
It went down my airway.

1148
00:40:51,673 --> 00:40:54,372
(Inhaling properly again)

1149
00:40:54,373 --> 00:40:55,513
It's so good.

1150
00:40:55,613 --> 00:40:56,613
(Lucky you)

1151
00:40:56,614 --> 00:40:58,012
The flavors...

1152
00:40:58,013 --> 00:40:59,942
seem concentrated.

1153
00:40:59,943 --> 00:41:01,753
That's how it smells.

1154
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:04,112
Pani Bottle, is there...

1155
00:41:04,113 --> 00:41:06,982
another travel-related question you can ask us?

1156
00:41:06,983 --> 00:41:08,422
Okay, I'll ask one more.

1157
00:41:08,423 --> 00:41:09,452
We even made a segment for you.

1158
00:41:09,453 --> 00:41:11,222
"Pani Bottle's World Trivia."

1159
00:41:11,223 --> 00:41:13,462
- Pani Bottle's World Trivia.
- Trivia!

1160
00:41:13,463 --> 00:41:14,492
(Pani Bottle's World Trivia)

1161
00:41:14,493 --> 00:41:15,632
Is this okay?

1162
00:41:15,633 --> 00:41:16,762
Yes, it's fine.

1163
00:41:16,763 --> 00:41:20,303
This isn't something I've personally seen,

1164
00:41:20,903 --> 00:41:22,102
but I've been to this country.

1165
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:23,203
It's about Iceland.

1166
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:24,902
- Iceland?
- Iceland...

1167
00:41:24,903 --> 00:41:26,242
is cold, barren,

1168
00:41:26,243 --> 00:41:27,542
and has a low population.

1169
00:41:27,543 --> 00:41:29,513
However,

1170
00:41:29,713 --> 00:41:31,842
there's a strange app only used in Iceland.

1171
00:41:31,843 --> 00:41:33,343
- An app?
- Yes.

1172
00:41:33,613 --> 00:41:34,843
- I know.
- I know.

1173
00:41:35,213 --> 00:41:36,553
An app to track polar bears.

1174
00:41:36,753 --> 00:41:37,913
- Incorrect.
- Polar bears...

1175
00:41:38,253 --> 00:41:39,852
He gave us a hint with the question.

1176
00:41:39,853 --> 00:41:40,853
Urgent, did you say?

1177
00:41:40,854 --> 00:41:42,494
- No, barren and cold.
- Oh, it's barren.

1178
00:41:42,793 --> 00:41:45,092
We're running out of time, so move it along.

1179
00:41:45,093 --> 00:41:47,392
- I see.
- Isn't it urgent?

1180
00:41:47,393 --> 00:41:48,393
The food is getting cold.

1181
00:41:48,394 --> 00:41:49,463
It's barren?

1182
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:51,432
I know.

1183
00:41:51,433 --> 00:41:52,732
An app for SOS calls.

1184
00:41:52,733 --> 00:41:54,202
(Dong Hyun: An SOS app)

1185
00:41:54,203 --> 00:41:55,802
- That's a good one.
- An app for SOS calls.

1186
00:41:55,803 --> 00:41:57,002
- That must not be it.
- Right, we have that too.

1187
00:41:57,003 --> 00:41:58,402
- Incorrect.
- I know.

1188
00:41:58,403 --> 00:42:00,403
- One for northern lights.
- I'll give you a hint.

1189
00:42:00,773 --> 00:42:02,612
The hint is this.

1190
00:42:02,613 --> 00:42:03,842
(They keep getting it wrong, so he drops a hint.)

1191
00:42:03,843 --> 00:42:05,483
I'll tell you about Iceland.

1192
00:42:05,743 --> 00:42:07,142
Iceland has a small population,

1193
00:42:07,143 --> 00:42:09,213
and this app has something to do...

1194
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:11,513
with dating.

1195
00:42:12,053 --> 00:42:13,682
It has something to do with dating.

1196
00:42:13,683 --> 00:42:14,823
- I know.
- I know.

1197
00:42:15,593 --> 00:42:17,523
It was close, but Sang Uk was quicker.

1198
00:42:17,693 --> 00:42:18,899
- Go ahead.
- I'll let you go first.

1199
00:42:18,923 --> 00:42:21,163
- You'll get it wrong anyway.
- An app to find a spouse.

1200
00:42:21,493 --> 00:42:22,932
- I know.
- It's similar,

1201
00:42:22,933 --> 00:42:24,062
but you need to take it further.

1202
00:42:24,063 --> 00:42:25,302
- I know.
- Go ahead.

1203
00:42:25,303 --> 00:42:26,702
Because it has a small population and is barren,

1204
00:42:26,703 --> 00:42:28,302
you can easily find yourself in dangerous situations.

1205
00:42:28,303 --> 00:42:29,703
An app to locate people around you.

1206
00:42:29,973 --> 00:42:31,102
Incorrect.

1207
00:42:31,103 --> 00:42:32,502
It has a small population.

1208
00:42:32,503 --> 00:42:33,872
- A low population?
- You need to verify things.

1209
00:42:33,873 --> 00:42:35,003
I got it.

1210
00:42:35,273 --> 00:42:36,342
To see if they are biologically related.

1211
00:42:36,343 --> 00:42:37,373
Correct!

1212
00:42:37,773 --> 00:42:39,543
- What?
- In Iceland,

1213
00:42:39,883 --> 00:42:42,753
the population is very small. They only have 300,000 people.

1214
00:42:42,913 --> 00:42:45,752
So, they register their names on the app before going on a date...

1215
00:42:45,753 --> 00:42:48,352
so that they can check if they're related.

1216
00:42:48,353 --> 00:42:51,053
- Really?
- I just read it from somewhere.

1217
00:42:51,123 --> 00:42:53,692
That was a pretty interesting quiz.

1218
00:42:53,693 --> 00:42:55,332
It's to prevent them from marrying...

1219
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:57,562
- their third cousins or something.
- Yes.

1220
00:42:57,563 --> 00:42:59,003
Relatives can't date,

1221
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:01,532
so they have an app where they can check that.

1222
00:43:01,533 --> 00:43:03,449
(It's a small world, and there are various problems.)

1223
00:43:03,473 --> 00:43:07,403
(Yi Kyung wins the quiz for the freeloaders.)

1224
00:43:07,643 --> 00:43:08,713
Let's taste it.

1225
00:43:09,473 --> 00:43:11,412
(Eating it in one bite)

1226
00:43:11,413 --> 00:43:12,713
Breathe through your nose.

1227
00:43:13,643 --> 00:43:14,643
It's deep, isn't it?

1228
00:43:14,644 --> 00:43:15,712
(Grinning)

1229
00:43:15,713 --> 00:43:17,553
It's so high-quality.

1230
00:43:17,783 --> 00:43:19,703
Now I get why Tae Hyun said this was number one.

1231
00:43:20,283 --> 00:43:22,452
When he really likes something,

1232
00:43:22,453 --> 00:43:24,452
he sends the info on his phone right away.

1233
00:43:24,453 --> 00:43:27,123
- Like, "I'm coming back here." - I already did.

1234
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:29,483
I would have regretted it if I hadn't tried that.

1235
00:43:30,133 --> 00:43:32,363
This was the best pasta I've had in my life.

1236
00:43:34,003 --> 00:43:36,933
(I wonder how it tastes.)

1237
00:43:37,173 --> 00:43:39,073
Pani Bottle's World Trivia!

1238
00:43:39,473 --> 00:43:40,503
I wasn't...

1239
00:43:40,903 --> 00:43:43,043
I wasn't thinking of anything. Give me a moment.

1240
00:43:43,313 --> 00:43:46,212
I think we should stop now. When we have dinner...

1241
00:43:46,213 --> 00:43:48,182
Right. Do it again during dinnertime.

1242
00:43:48,183 --> 00:43:49,183
- Later today.
- Okay.

1243
00:43:49,184 --> 00:43:50,883
Come up with like 15 quizzes in advance.

1244
00:43:51,353 --> 00:43:52,982
- Fifteen quizzes.
- Sounds great.

1245
00:43:52,983 --> 00:43:54,482
Pani Bottle's World Trivia.

1246
00:43:54,483 --> 00:43:57,252
- I think we can go now.
- The bill?

1247
00:43:57,253 --> 00:43:58,323
Let's pay.

1248
00:43:58,923 --> 00:44:00,723
Can we get the bill, please?

1249
00:44:01,093 --> 00:44:02,192
It was 130 dollars.

1250
00:44:02,193 --> 00:44:03,792
(Total: 130 dollars)

1251
00:44:03,793 --> 00:44:04,862
Okay. That's not bad.

1252
00:44:04,863 --> 00:44:06,632
Compared to what we ordered, it's not that high.

1253
00:44:06,633 --> 00:44:08,363
I know, right? We ordered so much food.

1254
00:44:08,733 --> 00:44:12,372
A British company introduced various ways...

1255
00:44:12,373 --> 00:44:15,712
people around the world eat Italian food to a group of Italians,

1256
00:44:15,713 --> 00:44:17,343
and recorded their reactions.

1257
00:44:18,013 --> 00:44:20,082
Some of these eating habits were...

1258
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:21,642
so shocking from an Italian perspective...

1259
00:44:21,643 --> 00:44:23,413
that they sparked strong backlash.

1260
00:44:23,913 --> 00:44:26,153
- That sounds difficult.
- So, which of the following...

1261
00:44:26,383 --> 00:44:27,982
- There are examples.
- It's a multiple-choice quiz.

1262
00:44:27,983 --> 00:44:29,553
Did Italians...

1263
00:44:30,423 --> 00:44:33,023
say was acceptable?

1264
00:44:34,393 --> 00:44:38,163
One, adding cream to carbonara sauce.

1265
00:44:38,193 --> 00:44:41,303
Two, eating pizza with a fork.

1266
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:43,302
That can never be the answer.

1267
00:44:43,303 --> 00:44:44,983
We need to pick one way that's acceptable.

1268
00:44:45,443 --> 00:44:47,742
Three, serving pasta...

1269
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:50,243
as a side dish, not the main course.

1270
00:44:51,513 --> 00:44:53,443
Pasta, side dish.

1271
00:44:53,913 --> 00:44:57,683
Four, cutting long pasta with a knife.

1272
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:00,422
Only one of these was considered acceptable.

1273
00:45:00,423 --> 00:45:04,322
Numbers 2 and 4 are definitely not the answer.

1274
00:45:04,323 --> 00:45:05,323
- I agree.
- Yes.

1275
00:45:05,324 --> 00:45:07,262
You're saying that's unacceptable, right?

1276
00:45:07,263 --> 00:45:09,532
I've actually seen a short video...

1277
00:45:09,533 --> 00:45:11,232
where an Italian got angry...

1278
00:45:11,233 --> 00:45:13,802
as soon as someone broke the pasta.

1279
00:45:13,803 --> 00:45:15,472
- And this was one of them.
- Is your answer number three?

1280
00:45:15,473 --> 00:45:16,533
Number 1 or number 3.

1281
00:45:16,703 --> 00:45:19,543
I don't think number one is acceptable...

1282
00:45:19,643 --> 00:45:22,113
because carbonara made in the original way...

1283
00:45:23,113 --> 00:45:24,212
doesn't contain cream.

1284
00:45:24,213 --> 00:45:25,642
(Seung Ho says there's no cream in original carbonara.)

1285
00:45:25,643 --> 00:45:30,053
It's made of cheese and eggs only.

1286
00:45:30,683 --> 00:45:33,022
- That's the original way.
- I think I've heard of it.

1287
00:45:33,023 --> 00:45:34,083
Then, it has to be...

1288
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:36,822
You can eat pasta as a side dish, can't you?

1289
00:45:36,823 --> 00:45:39,292
Italians are...

1290
00:45:39,293 --> 00:45:41,362
proud of their pizza,

1291
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:44,092
so they may not eat pizza with a fork.

1292
00:45:44,093 --> 00:45:45,333
That might be the case.

1293
00:45:45,603 --> 00:45:48,533
So, eating pasta as a side dish...

1294
00:45:49,103 --> 00:45:50,702
may be acceptable to them.

1295
00:45:50,703 --> 00:45:52,843
- So, number 3?
- I also think it's number 3.

1296
00:45:53,203 --> 00:45:55,372
- Number 3.
- We'll pick number 3.

1297
00:45:55,373 --> 00:45:56,943
(They came to an agreement in no time.)

1298
00:45:57,413 --> 00:46:01,112
Three, serving pasta as a side dish, not the main course.

1299
00:46:01,113 --> 00:46:02,113
I think we're right.

1300
00:46:02,114 --> 00:46:04,852
(3, serving pasta as a side dish, not the main course)

1301
00:46:04,853 --> 00:46:06,323
It is incorrect.

1302
00:46:06,623 --> 00:46:07,782
Then, it has to be number four.

1303
00:46:07,783 --> 00:46:08,823
- I'm sorry.
- What?

1304
00:46:09,623 --> 00:46:12,022
(Devastated)

1305
00:46:12,023 --> 00:46:13,193
It was a trap!

1306
00:46:13,293 --> 00:46:14,323
But...

1307
00:46:14,623 --> 00:46:16,832
How should we play individually?

1308
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:17,833
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1309
00:46:17,834 --> 00:46:19,262
- Yes, and we pick an answer.
- We take turns.

1310
00:46:19,263 --> 00:46:21,223
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

1311
00:46:21,433 --> 00:46:23,502
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Pani is last.

1312
00:46:23,503 --> 00:46:24,602
(Pani Bottle goes last.)

1313
00:46:24,603 --> 00:46:26,102
I'm terrible at rock-paper-scissors.

1314
00:46:26,103 --> 00:46:27,103
(Seung Ho wins.)

1315
00:46:27,104 --> 00:46:29,042
- Seung Ho, Tae Hyun, and Pani.
- But it's actually...

1316
00:46:29,043 --> 00:46:32,442
- I'll pick number 2.
- I'll pick number 1.

1317
00:46:32,443 --> 00:46:34,143
- So, I get number 4.
- Yes, number 4.

1318
00:46:34,243 --> 00:46:35,389
One of them is correct, right?

1319
00:46:35,413 --> 00:46:38,182
The acceptable way for Italians was...

1320
00:46:38,183 --> 00:46:39,183
(Adding cream to carbonara: Tae Hyun, )

1321
00:46:39,184 --> 00:46:40,682
(Eating pizza with a fork: Seung Ho, Cutting pasta with a knife: Pani)

1322
00:46:40,683 --> 00:46:43,322
It was number two, eating pizza with a fork.

1323
00:46:43,323 --> 00:46:44,952
- Seriously?
- Then, Tae Hyun got it right?

1324
00:46:44,953 --> 00:46:45,963
No, it was Seung Ho.

1325
00:46:46,023 --> 00:46:47,222
Seung Ho?

1326
00:46:47,223 --> 00:46:48,932
(Seung Ho won't have to pay now.)

1327
00:46:48,933 --> 00:46:50,862
So, they also eat it with a fork.

1328
00:46:50,863 --> 00:46:53,362
I've never been to Italy, though. I'm going the day after tomorrow.

1329
00:46:53,363 --> 00:46:55,202
- I had no idea.
- Pani,

1330
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:56,873
make sure to eat pizza with a fork.

1331
00:46:56,903 --> 00:46:57,903
(Time for a quiz to decide who pays)

1332
00:46:57,904 --> 00:46:59,573
- It's 1-on-1.
- Let's play.

1333
00:47:00,143 --> 00:47:01,643
- Let's begin.
- It's a deathmatch.

1334
00:47:02,003 --> 00:47:05,442
In the Oval Office of US President Donald Trump,

1335
00:47:05,443 --> 00:47:07,243
there's a button on his desk.

1336
00:47:07,683 --> 00:47:11,252
When pressed, staff are expected to bring him...

1337
00:47:11,253 --> 00:47:13,283
this item.

1338
00:47:14,153 --> 00:47:17,652
It is one of the things you had today. What is it?

1339
00:47:17,653 --> 00:47:19,022
I got it. Coke?

1340
00:47:19,023 --> 00:47:20,023
Correct.

1341
00:47:20,024 --> 00:47:22,232
(Answer: Coke)

1342
00:47:22,233 --> 00:47:23,662
I got it. Coke?

1343
00:47:23,663 --> 00:47:24,733
Correct.

1344
00:47:25,933 --> 00:47:27,062
Didn't we get that quiz before?

1345
00:47:27,063 --> 00:47:28,203
Something just went by me.

1346
00:47:28,603 --> 00:47:29,703
Give us the quiz.

1347
00:47:30,003 --> 00:47:31,302
Did you know about this?

1348
00:47:31,303 --> 00:47:32,542
- No.
- There's a button on his desk,

1349
00:47:32,543 --> 00:47:33,543
and he gets Coke when he presses it.

1350
00:47:33,544 --> 00:47:35,464
I obviously thought it was for nuclear missiles.

1351
00:47:36,373 --> 00:47:37,743
- Me too.
- Isn't it obvious?

1352
00:47:38,143 --> 00:47:42,983
(This is the Coke button.)

1353
00:47:43,453 --> 00:47:48,423
(He loves Diet Coke, and the button was revealed in 2017.)

1354
00:47:48,453 --> 00:47:50,452
- You must have watched the news.
- I thought one of the things...

1355
00:47:50,453 --> 00:47:51,929
we had today contained uranium or something.

1356
00:47:51,953 --> 00:47:52,962
"Uranium?"

1357
00:47:52,963 --> 00:47:54,722
- Pani, you're so...
- I mean,

1358
00:47:54,723 --> 00:47:55,833
it happened so quickly.

1359
00:47:56,533 --> 00:47:57,892
You don't have a choice.

1360
00:47:57,893 --> 00:47:58,902
Is it decided, then?

1361
00:47:58,903 --> 00:48:01,103
No, if you lose again after dinner...

1362
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:02,933
- We play again later?
- Yes.

1363
00:48:03,733 --> 00:48:06,402
Okay. Sir, I'll pay for the food.

1364
00:48:06,403 --> 00:48:08,672
I feel so bad for Mr. Bottle.

1365
00:48:08,673 --> 00:48:09,673
- "Mr. Bottle?" - "Mr. Bottle?"

1366
00:48:09,674 --> 00:48:13,742
Mr. Bottle, we met for the first time today, and...

1367
00:48:13,743 --> 00:48:15,823
- "Mr. Bottle." - I haven't been to the White House.

1368
00:48:16,083 --> 00:48:17,712
I should have checked it out. I had no clue.

1369
00:48:17,713 --> 00:48:19,082
(Pani Bottle pays twice in a row.)

1370
00:48:19,083 --> 00:48:21,123
- Thanks for the food, Pani.
- Thank you.

1371
00:48:21,423 --> 00:48:22,492
Thank you.

1372
00:48:22,493 --> 00:48:25,123
(Just like that, their 2nd LMR ends.)

1373
00:48:25,723 --> 00:48:28,763
(After a hearty lunch, they move to...)

1374
00:48:29,133 --> 00:48:30,762
(a well-known campus in Seoul, )

1375
00:48:30,763 --> 00:48:32,403
(famous for its peaceful walking paths.)

1376
00:48:32,563 --> 00:48:36,072
(Pani Bottle's alma mater, Seoul Tech)

1377
00:48:36,073 --> 00:48:38,732
(And a coffee shop near the school)

1378
00:48:38,733 --> 00:48:40,843
Do we have to begin shooting when he's asleep?

1379
00:48:41,903 --> 00:48:42,942
It's Pani's nap time.

1380
00:48:42,943 --> 00:48:45,012
(Pani is sleeping in the middle of the film location.)

1381
00:48:45,013 --> 00:48:47,143
Let's begin shooting once I clap the slate.

1382
00:48:49,683 --> 00:48:52,683
(Fortunately, he wakes up as soon as he hears it.)

1383
00:48:53,023 --> 00:48:55,692
(He feels much better, thanks to his nap.)

1384
00:48:55,693 --> 00:48:58,652
Did you like traveling when you were in college?

1385
00:48:58,653 --> 00:48:59,762
I did.

1386
00:48:59,763 --> 00:49:03,132
One day, I brought a bicycle to school...

1387
00:49:03,133 --> 00:49:05,832
and rode it straight to Incheon Port...

1388
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:07,902
- after class.
- From here?

1389
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:10,832
Yes. I spent the night there and went to Jeju Island.

1390
00:49:10,833 --> 00:49:13,903
It's 72km from here to Incheon Port.

1391
00:49:14,403 --> 00:49:16,073
It must have taken me two days, then.

1392
00:49:16,373 --> 00:49:18,072
- On a bicycle?
- He really loved traveling.

1393
00:49:18,073 --> 00:49:20,583
I feel this every time I see him.

1394
00:49:20,683 --> 00:49:23,052
- He has that uniqueness.
- Indeed.

1395
00:49:23,053 --> 00:49:25,082
That's what made him such a fantastic traveler.

1396
00:49:25,083 --> 00:49:26,222
I agree.

1397
00:49:26,223 --> 00:49:27,882
I'm still fascinated.

1398
00:49:27,883 --> 00:49:30,392
I never imagined that I'd make a living...

1399
00:49:30,393 --> 00:49:31,852
by traveling.

1400
00:49:31,853 --> 00:49:33,062
- It's impressive.
- It still fascinates me.

1401
00:49:33,063 --> 00:49:34,092
(It's impressive enough that he pioneered the way.)

1402
00:49:34,093 --> 00:49:36,092
Where are we having dinner?

1403
00:49:36,093 --> 00:49:37,763
Can you make a recommendation?

1404
00:49:38,463 --> 00:49:40,062
- I have something in mind.
- Okay.

1405
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:42,802
We went to two restaurants, right?

1406
00:49:42,803 --> 00:49:45,373
Sadly, I didn't know either of them,

1407
00:49:45,643 --> 00:49:47,942
so I had nothing to talk about, although we were in Gongneung.

1408
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:51,843
I'll tell you about the places. that I still often visit.

1409
00:49:51,943 --> 00:49:55,242
I was a regular in two places when I was in college.

1410
00:49:55,243 --> 00:49:56,252
(Excited)

1411
00:49:56,253 --> 00:49:57,352
They're old restaurants, then.

1412
00:49:57,353 --> 00:50:00,252
One of them is right nearby. It's on our left.

1413
00:50:00,253 --> 00:50:04,952
They sell makgeolli and jeon. And the most popular dish is...

1414
00:50:04,953 --> 00:50:07,692
- turkey.
- Turkey?

1415
00:50:07,693 --> 00:50:09,363
- They sell turkey?
- Yes.

1416
00:50:09,433 --> 00:50:11,193
I've never had turkey before.

1417
00:50:11,463 --> 00:50:12,932
(What?)

1418
00:50:12,933 --> 00:50:14,803
It's nice and salty.

1419
00:50:15,163 --> 00:50:16,832
They serve turkey with chives.

1420
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:18,432
(Salty and chewy roasted turkey)

1421
00:50:18,433 --> 00:50:20,472
I went there so many times back in college.

1422
00:50:20,473 --> 00:50:23,343
The other restaurant is a makchang place.

1423
00:50:23,613 --> 00:50:25,142
- Is it pork makchang?
- Yes, pork.

1424
00:50:25,143 --> 00:50:27,042
- The round ones.
- It's a popular place...

1425
00:50:27,043 --> 00:50:30,513
in the entire school, so I often visit.

1426
00:50:30,683 --> 00:50:37,093
(Makchang is savory and has a great texture.)

1427
00:50:37,493 --> 00:50:40,562
(Folk food or roasted makchang)

1428
00:50:40,563 --> 00:50:42,932
- I made up my mind.
- Okay.

1429
00:50:42,933 --> 00:50:44,453
I want to go to the folk food place...

1430
00:50:44,493 --> 00:50:47,303
and order a ridiculous amount of food.

1431
00:50:47,933 --> 00:50:49,903
I want a hearty meal.

1432
00:50:49,933 --> 00:50:51,632
I'll also go to the folk food place.

1433
00:50:51,633 --> 00:50:52,642
(Yi Kyung chooses folk food.)

1434
00:50:52,643 --> 00:50:54,279
I'm dying to know what that turkey tastes like.

1435
00:50:54,303 --> 00:50:55,813
I've never had turkey before.

1436
00:50:56,313 --> 00:50:57,972
- I'll pick makchang.
- Makchang?

1437
00:50:57,973 --> 00:50:59,843
I had already made up my mind.

1438
00:51:00,283 --> 00:51:02,483
I'm a regular at both places,

1439
00:51:02,953 --> 00:51:04,182
but I'll go with makchang.

1440
00:51:04,183 --> 00:51:05,952
(He chooses makchang after a long deliberation.)

1441
00:51:05,953 --> 00:51:07,253
I made up my mind.

1442
00:51:08,053 --> 00:51:09,492
I'm going to try makchang.

1443
00:51:09,493 --> 00:51:10,493
- Why?
- Why?

1444
00:51:10,494 --> 00:51:13,493
Makchang is a protein food.

1445
00:51:14,193 --> 00:51:15,962
If both Sang Uk and Seung Ho are eating makchang,

1446
00:51:15,963 --> 00:51:17,133
we'll need two grills.

1447
00:51:17,763 --> 00:51:19,162
- You should come with us, Tae Hyun.
- What?

1448
00:51:19,163 --> 00:51:20,203
Come with us.

1449
00:51:20,533 --> 00:51:22,432
(Come and eat folk food.)

1450
00:51:22,433 --> 00:51:24,803
Dong Hyun is just worried he'll have to pay.

1451
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:26,002
(Trying to persuade Tae Hyun, the weakest link)

1452
00:51:26,003 --> 00:51:28,002
- Come with me.
- This guy.

1453
00:51:28,003 --> 00:51:29,242
Are you worried that I'll beat you?

1454
00:51:29,243 --> 00:51:31,873
Why do I keep losing to him?

1455
00:51:31,943 --> 00:51:33,243
It's so annoying.

1456
00:51:34,213 --> 00:51:35,312
It's a battle between him and me.

1457
00:51:35,313 --> 00:51:36,412
(Tae Hyun picks folk food.)

1458
00:51:36,413 --> 00:51:37,512
I still have to go there.

1459
00:51:37,513 --> 00:51:40,552
Today's dinner is a trip down Pani Bottle's memory lane.

1460
00:51:40,553 --> 00:51:41,922
We'll head to the folk food place first.

1461
00:51:41,923 --> 00:51:43,053
Let's get going.

1462
00:51:43,723 --> 00:51:45,022
- Let's go.
- I bet it tastes good.

1463
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,363
I wonder what turkey tastes like.

1464
00:51:47,863 --> 00:51:51,262
(The college students are busy...)

1465
00:51:51,263 --> 00:51:54,633
(moving to their favorite places for dinner.)

1466
00:51:56,033 --> 00:51:57,203
(The main gate of Seoul Tech)

1467
00:51:57,473 --> 00:51:58,702
(Right next to Seoul Tech, )

1468
00:51:58,703 --> 00:52:01,703
(there's a popular food alley.)

1469
00:52:02,243 --> 00:52:04,372
(At the end of the road, the guys gathered for dinner.)

1470
00:52:04,373 --> 00:52:06,282
I've been here such a long time ago.

1471
00:52:06,283 --> 00:52:08,243
This place is pretty old too.

1472
00:52:08,343 --> 00:52:10,653
It does look old.

1473
00:52:11,113 --> 00:52:13,482
It was here when I entered, and it's still here.

1474
00:52:13,483 --> 00:52:14,952
So, it's been over 20 years.

1475
00:52:14,953 --> 00:52:16,023
Look what it says.

1476
00:52:19,123 --> 00:52:21,892
What's "All-night Printing?" Is that the name of a restaurant?

1477
00:52:21,893 --> 00:52:23,692
- They can print all night.
- It's a printing shop.

1478
00:52:23,693 --> 00:52:24,762
Oh, it's a printing shop?

1479
00:52:24,763 --> 00:52:26,232
A printing shop for students.

1480
00:52:26,233 --> 00:52:29,333
(Where college students print their class materials)

1481
00:52:30,033 --> 00:52:34,273
(There are many printing shops around.)

1482
00:52:34,843 --> 00:52:37,272
(Something you only see in college towns)

1483
00:52:37,273 --> 00:52:39,382
- Let's get going.
- The menu stayed the same.

1484
00:52:39,383 --> 00:52:41,043
It was the same menu back in the day.

1485
00:52:41,243 --> 00:52:42,283
This is...

1486
00:52:42,653 --> 00:52:44,882
- so old.
- This looks...

1487
00:52:44,883 --> 00:52:45,883
incredible.

1488
00:52:45,884 --> 00:52:48,952
It's something you expect to see in a college town.

1489
00:52:48,953 --> 00:52:50,152
It's familiar to what I saw in college.

1490
00:52:50,153 --> 00:52:52,823
(Follow the alley, and you see...)

1491
00:52:53,363 --> 00:52:54,892
Wait. Is this...

1492
00:52:54,893 --> 00:52:55,893
(Arriving at Pani's first memory)

1493
00:52:55,894 --> 00:52:56,933
Hello.

1494
00:52:58,063 --> 00:52:59,203
It's not that big.

1495
00:52:59,633 --> 00:53:01,503
- There's more room inside.
- Pani.

1496
00:53:01,533 --> 00:53:03,373
Oh, I see it.

1497
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:06,403
There's more inside. Let's check it out.

1498
00:53:07,143 --> 00:53:10,543
The main area was inside.

1499
00:53:10,643 --> 00:53:12,512
- You're right.
- That's what I'm talking about.

1500
00:53:12,513 --> 00:53:13,682
The lighting is perfect.

1501
00:53:13,683 --> 00:53:15,383
(The lights change inside.)

1502
00:53:16,153 --> 00:53:18,613
- It's so big inside!
- It's huge.

1503
00:53:19,253 --> 00:53:20,453
They even have floor tables!

1504
00:53:21,983 --> 00:53:25,292
There were more floor tables here, though.

1505
00:53:25,293 --> 00:53:26,422
- They left some.
- But they changed it.

1506
00:53:26,423 --> 00:53:28,493
That table is the essence.

1507
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:31,693
(It used to look like this.)

1508
00:53:32,603 --> 00:53:36,232
(They have changed the design for convenience.)

1509
00:53:36,233 --> 00:53:38,372
When there were only floor tables,

1510
00:53:38,373 --> 00:53:40,673
drunk kids used to go to sleep on the floor.

1511
00:53:41,203 --> 00:53:43,013
This place is so old.

1512
00:53:43,243 --> 00:53:45,172
You need a place like this in a college town.

1513
00:53:45,173 --> 00:53:46,933
(The restaurant that Pani vividly remembers)

1514
00:53:47,683 --> 00:53:49,652
(It's like stepping back in time, )

1515
00:53:49,653 --> 00:53:51,653
(and the place is filled with an old-world charm.)

1516
00:53:52,153 --> 00:53:55,723
(But inside, it's packed with young scholars.)

1517
00:53:56,493 --> 00:53:58,523
(And the one reason...)

1518
00:53:59,293 --> 00:54:02,323
(they all come here is...)

1519
00:54:02,963 --> 00:54:07,202
(a single dish served on every table.)

1520
00:54:07,203 --> 00:54:09,703
- Roasted turkey.
- Roasted turkey.

1521
00:54:09,873 --> 00:54:11,773
Roasted turkey is their best dish.

1522
00:54:12,003 --> 00:54:13,902
You must always have roasted turkey with extra meat...

1523
00:54:13,903 --> 00:54:15,873
when you come here.

1524
00:54:16,243 --> 00:54:20,613
(DMR 1: Folk food)

1525
00:54:21,713 --> 00:54:22,952
Is she the owner?

1526
00:54:22,953 --> 00:54:24,352
- Hello.
- Hello.

1527
00:54:24,353 --> 00:54:25,412
(The owner walks in...)

1528
00:54:25,413 --> 00:54:26,782
(and puts something on the table.)

1529
00:54:26,783 --> 00:54:27,822
Is this the menu?

1530
00:54:27,823 --> 00:54:29,022
This is the menu?

1531
00:54:29,023 --> 00:54:31,593
(The menu)

1532
00:54:32,193 --> 00:54:34,592
(A scroll-type menu that looks like a command)

1533
00:54:34,593 --> 00:54:36,563
- Is this the same one from before?
- Of course.

1534
00:54:37,733 --> 00:54:40,002
We had a way of opening it, though.

1535
00:54:40,003 --> 00:54:41,362
- That's not how you open it.
- How do you open it?

1536
00:54:41,363 --> 00:54:42,403
You go like this.

1537
00:54:43,303 --> 00:54:45,872
We used to open the menu like this.

1538
00:54:45,873 --> 00:54:48,072
(You want to hear the fluttering sound as it unfurls.)

1539
00:54:48,073 --> 00:54:50,443
Even opening a menu had to be cool when you were young.

1540
00:54:50,943 --> 00:54:52,272
(I remember now.)

1541
00:54:52,273 --> 00:54:54,259
Have you been running this place for about 15 years?

1542
00:54:54,283 --> 00:54:55,952
- It's been 16 years.
- It's been 16 years?

1543
00:54:55,953 --> 00:54:57,012
Sixteen years?

1544
00:54:57,013 --> 00:54:58,083
He was just a boy.

1545
00:54:58,383 --> 00:54:59,482
- He was a young man.
- You remember him?

1546
00:54:59,483 --> 00:55:00,522
- You do?
- Of course, I do.

1547
00:55:00,523 --> 00:55:01,622
- Goodness.
- A lot of students...

1548
00:55:01,623 --> 00:55:03,293
majoring in art came here.

1549
00:55:03,453 --> 00:55:05,592
Even your part-timers were art students.

1550
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,062
- Most of them were.
- Yes.

1551
00:55:07,063 --> 00:55:08,492
(Numerous art students frequented this place.)

1552
00:55:08,493 --> 00:55:10,063
What was your impression...

1553
00:55:10,633 --> 00:55:13,563
of Jae Han when he was a college student?

1554
00:55:13,733 --> 00:55:15,703
He was exactly the same.

1555
00:55:15,903 --> 00:55:18,573
He was friendly and funny with his words.

1556
00:55:19,073 --> 00:55:20,703
He was just like he is now.

1557
00:55:20,943 --> 00:55:22,542
But he's gotten more handsome.

1558
00:55:22,543 --> 00:55:24,112
(Now, he's a bit more handsome.)

1559
00:55:24,113 --> 00:55:25,612
Did he usually come here...

1560
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:28,743
with female students for a drink?

1561
00:55:29,213 --> 00:55:30,213
He only came with male students,

1562
00:55:30,214 --> 00:55:33,282
- but they were all good-looking.
- Were they?

1563
00:55:33,283 --> 00:55:34,582
All his friends are handsome.

1564
00:55:34,583 --> 00:55:36,122
- The students in my major...
- Yes, they were tall.

1565
00:55:36,123 --> 00:55:38,152
- were all tall.
- They were tall.

1566
00:55:38,153 --> 00:55:39,322
And they were heavy drinkers.

1567
00:55:39,323 --> 00:55:40,992
- Kind of like them.
- Yes, just like them.

1568
00:55:40,993 --> 00:55:42,022
(They probably looked like these guys.)

1569
00:55:42,023 --> 00:55:43,633
What's your main dish now?

1570
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:45,633
- The turkey dish.
- Oh, it's the same!

1571
00:55:45,963 --> 00:55:48,662
- We'll have to try the turkey.
- We have to.

1572
00:55:48,663 --> 00:55:49,772
It's mandatory.

1573
00:55:49,773 --> 00:55:52,943
The rolled omelet is their second signature dish.

1574
00:55:53,143 --> 00:55:54,943
- The rolled omelet?
- Yes.

1575
00:55:55,173 --> 00:55:57,042
- We'll order the food now.
- Turkey?

1576
00:55:57,043 --> 00:56:00,313
One roasted turkey, one tofu with kimchi,

1577
00:56:00,443 --> 00:56:01,642
- Kimchi jeon.
- one cheese kimchi jeon...

1578
00:56:01,643 --> 00:56:03,483
with half cheese,

1579
00:56:03,653 --> 00:56:05,682
and one cheese rolled omelet with half cheese.

1580
00:56:05,683 --> 00:56:07,182
- Okay.
- Let's save some cheese.

1581
00:56:07,183 --> 00:56:08,522
That's all.

1582
00:56:08,523 --> 00:56:09,852
- All right.
- Thank you.

1583
00:56:09,853 --> 00:56:11,352
I love their menu.

1584
00:56:11,353 --> 00:56:12,492
The whole table is going to be full.

1585
00:56:12,493 --> 00:56:14,822
They have so many different types of drinks.

1586
00:56:14,823 --> 00:56:17,192
All kinds of makgeolli. I've never seen this before.

1587
00:56:17,193 --> 00:56:19,832
Peach makgeolli, green grape makgeolli,

1588
00:56:19,833 --> 00:56:21,562
banana makgeolli... What's melon makgeolli?

1589
00:56:21,563 --> 00:56:23,132
Most of their customers must be females.

1590
00:56:23,133 --> 00:56:24,232
Chocolate milk on the menu...

1591
00:56:24,233 --> 00:56:25,579
- means most of them are females.
- It's proof.

1592
00:56:25,603 --> 00:56:26,742
Why is that proof...

1593
00:56:26,743 --> 00:56:28,302
that many college girls come to this place?

1594
00:56:28,303 --> 00:56:30,472
Girls love chocolate milk when they drink.

1595
00:56:30,473 --> 00:56:31,673
- How do you know that?
- Why?

1596
00:56:32,743 --> 00:56:33,982
That's what I heard.

1597
00:56:33,983 --> 00:56:36,652
(That's what I heard.)

1598
00:56:36,653 --> 00:56:39,012
I bet a lot of girls asked you to get chocolate milk with them.

1599
00:56:39,013 --> 00:56:40,822
- No, I don't eat chocolate.
- Right.

1600
00:56:40,823 --> 00:56:41,922
So, I always said no.

1601
00:56:41,923 --> 00:56:43,392
They won't leave him alone.

1602
00:56:43,393 --> 00:56:44,452
Indeed. I bet he went.

1603
00:56:44,453 --> 00:56:45,552
They must have asked him so many times.

1604
00:56:45,553 --> 00:56:47,339
All of them would have asked Sang Uk to go with them.

1605
00:56:47,363 --> 00:56:49,762
And a guy who looks like Dong Hyun will go, "I'll come with you."

1606
00:56:49,763 --> 00:56:52,592
"No, you don't have to come."

1607
00:56:52,593 --> 00:56:54,262
And in the end,

1608
00:56:54,263 --> 00:56:55,932
he goes to the store alone.

1609
00:56:55,933 --> 00:56:57,173
Like, "No, I'll come with you!"

1610
00:56:57,333 --> 00:56:58,773
He comes back, and they're all gone.

1611
00:56:59,273 --> 00:57:01,443
They moved to the next place without me.

1612
00:57:01,643 --> 00:57:02,672
I'm like, "Where is everyone?"

1613
00:57:02,673 --> 00:57:04,012
- He's taking a step further.
- Right.

1614
00:57:04,013 --> 00:57:05,943
"That's okay. I'll bring the chocolate milk!"

1615
00:57:07,283 --> 00:57:08,943
"Can we take out the leftovers?"

1616
00:57:09,513 --> 00:57:11,313
You have to pack the leftovers.

1617
00:57:11,683 --> 00:57:15,583
(I'll share it with my friends.)

1618
00:57:15,923 --> 00:57:19,722
If I went to this school...

1619
00:57:19,723 --> 00:57:22,622
and lived in this neighborhood, I would have definitely come here.

1620
00:57:22,623 --> 00:57:24,862
- So many times.
- When I was in college,

1621
00:57:24,863 --> 00:57:27,163
I walked by this place after class on purpose.

1622
00:57:27,363 --> 00:57:29,432
Then, my seniors or classmates would be drinking...

1623
00:57:29,433 --> 00:57:31,193
and ask me, "Where are you off to? Join us."

1624
00:57:31,503 --> 00:57:32,673
That happened every time.

1625
00:57:32,903 --> 00:57:34,872
I walked by this place to see if my friends were here.

1626
00:57:34,873 --> 00:57:37,072
- That sounds great.
- I walk in,

1627
00:57:37,073 --> 00:57:39,643
and metal craft majors are in this room,

1628
00:57:39,783 --> 00:57:40,942
so I go in and say hi.

1629
00:57:40,943 --> 00:57:42,282
And sculpture majors are in the next room,

1630
00:57:42,283 --> 00:57:45,013
and I'd go say hi.

1631
00:57:45,953 --> 00:57:47,552
It was totally a hideout for art students back in the day.

1632
00:57:47,553 --> 00:57:49,992
- We came here so often.
- Right.

1633
00:57:49,993 --> 00:57:51,423
That's how things are in college.

1634
00:57:52,863 --> 00:57:54,463
What's the part-timer's major?

1635
00:57:55,223 --> 00:57:56,892
I'm an industrial design major.

1636
00:57:56,893 --> 00:57:57,893
Oh, my.

1637
00:57:57,894 --> 00:57:59,639
- Industrial design.
- Are you currently a student?

1638
00:57:59,663 --> 00:58:01,133
Then, he's your junior.

1639
00:58:01,703 --> 00:58:02,949
Would you like to join us for a minute?

1640
00:58:02,973 --> 00:58:04,202
- Is that okay?
- Sure.

1641
00:58:04,203 --> 00:58:05,433
- Of course.
- Join us.

1642
00:58:07,073 --> 00:58:08,142
He's Gen Z!

1643
00:58:08,143 --> 00:58:10,583
- He looks like a Japanese major.
- He's got so many tattoos.

1644
00:58:11,273 --> 00:58:13,412
And there's something in his nose. Is it penetrating horizontally?

1645
00:58:13,413 --> 00:58:14,713
Art students have to get this.

1646
00:58:15,683 --> 00:58:17,082
Is it penetrating all the way?

1647
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:18,252
- No.
- No way!

1648
00:58:18,253 --> 00:58:20,082
- Of course not.
- It can't be!

1649
00:58:20,083 --> 00:58:21,083
I mean...

1650
00:58:21,084 --> 00:58:23,269
- Do you think he's a chieftain?
- But it looks like...

1651
00:58:23,293 --> 00:58:24,822
I mean...

1652
00:58:24,823 --> 00:58:27,093
Were you thinking of nose rings for cows?

1653
00:58:27,623 --> 00:58:28,623
No.

1654
00:58:28,624 --> 00:58:30,493
It looked like they were connected.

1655
00:58:30,863 --> 00:58:32,632
- I made them look like that.
- Right?

1656
00:58:32,633 --> 00:58:33,762
(It's pierced so nicely.)

1657
00:58:33,763 --> 00:58:35,362
- Yes.
- What year are you in?

1658
00:58:35,363 --> 00:58:36,873
I'm in my final year.

1659
00:58:37,033 --> 00:58:38,472
- Fourth year?
- Yes, fourth year.

1660
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,379
- Your graduation exhibition.
- Yes, that's in this year.

1661
00:58:40,403 --> 00:58:41,542
It must be tough working part-time...

1662
00:58:41,543 --> 00:58:43,072
and preparing for the exhibition at the same time.

1663
00:58:43,073 --> 00:58:44,443
Yes, but I need to make a living.

1664
00:58:45,273 --> 00:58:46,782
- That's reality.
- Right.

1665
00:58:46,783 --> 00:58:47,882
You're so industrious.

1666
00:58:47,883 --> 00:58:49,883
You work really hard in your senior year.

1667
00:58:50,453 --> 00:58:53,583
What's the current gender ratio in art school?

1668
00:58:54,083 --> 00:58:56,022
It's still 9 to 1 or 8 to 2.

1669
00:58:56,023 --> 00:58:57,023
What?

1670
00:58:57,024 --> 00:58:58,652
- It's mostly girls.
- It's 9 to 1 or 8 to 2?

1671
00:58:58,653 --> 00:59:01,022
I bet the boys are popular, then.

1672
00:59:01,023 --> 00:59:02,023
Not exactly.

1673
00:59:02,024 --> 00:59:03,262
- Surprisingly, it's not true.
- No?

1674
00:59:03,263 --> 00:59:05,062
- That's never the case.
- Really?

1675
00:59:05,063 --> 00:59:07,202
I was also looking forward to that, but...

1676
00:59:07,203 --> 00:59:08,432
(I was also hoping that would happen.)

1677
00:59:08,433 --> 00:59:09,572
- My bad.
- It's fine.

1678
00:59:09,573 --> 00:59:12,603
(Apologizing)

1679
00:59:13,343 --> 00:59:14,902
Here's our food.

1680
00:59:14,903 --> 00:59:16,073
That's so much food!

1681
00:59:17,043 --> 00:59:19,143
- It smells the same.
- Thank you.

1682
00:59:19,643 --> 00:59:21,212
It looks like duck meat.

1683
00:59:21,213 --> 00:59:22,242
(In heaps)

1684
00:59:22,243 --> 00:59:24,083
- But you also serve...
- It looks legitimate.

1685
00:59:24,413 --> 00:59:26,952
I've never seen this before. It's so big, though.

1686
00:59:26,953 --> 00:59:29,123
- This was only 20 dollars.
- It is big.

1687
00:59:29,823 --> 00:59:32,352
- It looks scrumptious.
- What?

1688
00:59:32,353 --> 00:59:33,623
(It looks tasty.)

1689
00:59:34,523 --> 00:59:38,793
(Trapping the juice with a strong flame)

1690
00:59:39,963 --> 00:59:45,473
(Crispy skin and tender, juicy meat of the turkey leg)

1691
00:59:46,573 --> 00:59:52,043
(Cover them with heaps of chives, and you get...)

1692
00:59:54,113 --> 01:00:00,453
(Old Guard's signature dish, roasted turkey)

1693
01:00:00,883 --> 01:00:02,683
- It looks just like smoked duck.
- Totally.

1694
01:00:02,923 --> 01:00:04,422
How is this their main dish?

1695
01:00:04,423 --> 01:00:05,423
Turkey?

1696
01:00:05,424 --> 01:00:07,944
I don't think I've ever been to a place specializing in turkey.

1697
01:00:08,663 --> 01:00:11,233
Pani, do you dip it in the sauce?

1698
01:00:11,463 --> 01:00:12,532
I normally ate it with chives.

1699
01:00:12,533 --> 01:00:13,533
- Chives?
- Yes.

1700
01:00:13,534 --> 01:00:14,632
There are so many chives.

1701
01:00:14,633 --> 01:00:16,132
I like chives.

1702
01:00:16,133 --> 01:00:18,253
(Only eating the chives and meat as Pani recommended)

1703
01:00:18,733 --> 01:00:23,243
(All eyes are on Yi Kyung's first bite, once again.)

1704
01:00:29,443 --> 01:00:30,582
It's not that tough.

1705
01:00:30,583 --> 01:00:31,983
(Moaning)

1706
01:00:32,653 --> 01:00:35,283
- Turkey is so tender.
- Right?

1707
01:00:36,183 --> 01:00:37,822
It's much more tender than duck meat.

1708
01:00:37,823 --> 01:00:39,552
It just rips in your mouth.

1709
01:00:39,553 --> 01:00:42,792
It breaks along the grain...

1710
01:00:42,793 --> 01:00:44,533
- in my mouth.
- Yes, it breaks apart.

1711
01:00:45,163 --> 01:00:46,462
Turkey isn't so bad.

1712
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:48,543
(It magically breaks apart and melts in your mouth.)

1713
01:00:48,733 --> 01:00:51,303
- These chives taste amazing.
- The chives are fantastic.

1714
01:00:51,473 --> 01:00:53,242
- The chives...
- These chives are so good.

1715
01:00:53,243 --> 01:00:54,643
No wonder they serve them together.

1716
01:00:55,473 --> 01:00:56,942
It's saltier than smoked duck.

1717
01:00:56,943 --> 01:00:57,943
(A bunch of chives this time)

1718
01:00:57,944 --> 01:00:59,813
You need to eat a lot of chives.

1719
01:01:00,513 --> 01:01:02,442
It's also savory because of sesame oil,

1720
01:01:02,443 --> 01:01:03,482
so they go well together.

1721
01:01:03,483 --> 01:01:06,012
It's also pretty tart.

1722
01:01:06,013 --> 01:01:08,583
(It tastes even better.)

1723
01:01:08,783 --> 01:01:10,223
This is a good chives place.

1724
01:01:11,653 --> 01:01:15,692
The chives balance it out.

1725
01:01:15,693 --> 01:01:17,132
(The best sidekick...)

1726
01:01:17,133 --> 01:01:19,369
(that makes up for the taste with tartness and spiciness)

1727
01:01:19,393 --> 01:01:22,863
(Dong Hyun dips it in mustard sauce.)

1728
01:01:23,073 --> 01:01:25,932
I was worried that it might be too chewy,

1729
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:27,533
- But it's fine.
- but I shouldn't have.

1730
01:01:27,803 --> 01:01:29,672
It breaks apart to the point that I can feel the grain.

1731
01:01:29,673 --> 01:01:30,812
(But the sauce only helps.)

1732
01:01:30,813 --> 01:01:32,419
(The highlight of the dish is how tender the turkey is.)

1733
01:01:32,443 --> 01:01:33,942
It's Dong Hyun's favorite type of protein.

1734
01:01:33,943 --> 01:01:35,212
I love it.

1735
01:01:35,213 --> 01:01:36,312
(Roasted turkey, a perfectly balanced food, )

1736
01:01:36,313 --> 01:01:37,553
(both in texture and nutrition)

1737
01:01:39,453 --> 01:01:42,352
Are we having the quiz or not?

1738
01:01:42,353 --> 01:01:43,523
Let's have the quiz.

1739
01:01:43,723 --> 01:01:45,993
- That's not fair.
- The food was just served, guys.

1740
01:01:46,123 --> 01:01:48,363
- It's too soon.
- I love those chives.

1741
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:50,062
It's more painful because I know how it tastes.

1742
01:01:50,063 --> 01:01:51,493
- Right?
- It makes it tougher.

1743
01:01:51,763 --> 01:01:53,523
- That's true.
- It's tougher when you know.

1744
01:01:53,933 --> 01:01:58,033
On our way here, Pani Bottle said...

1745
01:01:58,533 --> 01:02:00,802
he wanted to try getting hit with a low kick.

1746
01:02:00,803 --> 01:02:01,803
- Your low kick?
- Yes!

1747
01:02:01,804 --> 01:02:03,542
He was more interested in that than I expected.

1748
01:02:03,543 --> 01:02:05,973
I saw a video of Choo Sung Hoon...

1749
01:02:06,173 --> 01:02:09,082
hitting a gentle low kick and everyone falling.

1750
01:02:09,083 --> 01:02:10,152
- They all fall.
- The light kick, right?

1751
01:02:10,153 --> 01:02:12,452
Yes, so I was curious about how much it hurt.

1752
01:02:12,453 --> 01:02:14,322
It wasn't even a swing.

1753
01:02:14,323 --> 01:02:16,953
He just lightly tapped them, and they fell to the ground.

1754
01:02:17,223 --> 01:02:19,623
So, I asked him if he could do that on me.

1755
01:02:19,993 --> 01:02:21,623
If you want a bite so badly,

1756
01:02:21,923 --> 01:02:23,333
we can give him one after a kick.

1757
01:02:23,433 --> 01:02:24,433
I'll try that now.

1758
01:02:24,433 --> 01:02:25,433
- Seriously?
- Yes.

1759
01:02:25,434 --> 01:02:28,302
Or you can kick him in the butt...

1760
01:02:28,303 --> 01:02:30,273
with an 80-percent force.

1761
01:02:30,603 --> 01:02:32,332
If I kick him with 80 percent of my power,

1762
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:33,813
he might fly away. Is that all right?

1763
01:02:34,003 --> 01:02:35,072
But...

1764
01:02:35,073 --> 01:02:37,113
(Will it be okay to disappear into the air?)

1765
01:02:37,313 --> 01:02:39,412
I watched a young fighter's game yesterday,

1766
01:02:39,413 --> 01:02:40,882
so I'm filled with energy.

1767
01:02:40,883 --> 01:02:42,312
- I'm heated up.
- That's good.

1768
01:02:42,313 --> 01:02:43,652
- You can't do it like that.
- I'll get the kick.

1769
01:02:43,653 --> 01:02:46,483
After watching the game, I got really excited.

1770
01:02:46,553 --> 01:02:48,722
I don't do any workout.

1771
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:50,552
I'd appreciate it if you take that into account.

1772
01:02:50,553 --> 01:02:51,969
(Please consider the fact that I don't work out.)

1773
01:02:51,993 --> 01:02:53,793
- Put your hand up.
- Like this?

1774
01:02:53,993 --> 01:02:55,362
If you have your hands down,

1775
01:02:55,363 --> 01:02:57,032
you're defenseless. Then I can't attack.

1776
01:02:57,033 --> 01:02:58,462
When you put your hands up, it becomes legal.

1777
01:02:58,463 --> 01:03:00,533
The opponent shows a will to fight.

1778
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:02,333
That's for defense.

1779
01:03:02,363 --> 01:03:03,672
Please act as if you'd hit me.

1780
01:03:03,673 --> 01:03:04,732
That's right. Now it's legal.

1781
01:03:04,733 --> 01:03:06,273
I should have bought insurance.

1782
01:03:06,303 --> 01:03:08,242
I'll kick lightly. At what percentage should I kick?

1783
01:03:08,243 --> 01:03:09,942
As strong as an ordinary person...

1784
01:03:09,943 --> 01:03:12,172
- can hold?
- That much?

1785
01:03:12,173 --> 01:03:13,382
What do you want to eat?

1786
01:03:13,383 --> 01:03:14,442
It'll vary the strength of the kick.

1787
01:03:14,443 --> 01:03:16,183
- I'm so scared all of a sudden.
- No.

1788
01:03:16,413 --> 01:03:17,582
Big one?

1789
01:03:17,583 --> 01:03:18,912
I crave chives...

1790
01:03:18,913 --> 01:03:20,382
- more than meat.
- I see.

1791
01:03:20,383 --> 01:03:21,582
I'll kick for the chives,

1792
01:03:21,583 --> 01:03:23,792
but because I watched the game yesterday,

1793
01:03:23,793 --> 01:03:25,252
- I'm a bit turned on.
- I see.

1794
01:03:25,253 --> 01:03:26,623
I'll add ten percent more.

1795
01:03:27,293 --> 01:03:29,023
- Just a little bit. Okay.
- Yes.

1796
01:03:29,523 --> 01:03:30,562
I'll kick it like this.

1797
01:03:30,563 --> 01:03:31,662
- I'll kick from here.
- Good.

1798
01:03:31,663 --> 01:03:32,663
(Dong Hyun shows how strong the kick will be.)

1799
01:03:32,664 --> 01:03:33,733
(Is that it?)

1800
01:03:33,863 --> 01:03:36,733
Can I say it doesn't hurt if it doesn't?

1801
01:03:37,303 --> 01:03:39,332
I don't have to exaggerate for the show, do I?

1802
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:40,442
- Of course not.
- No.

1803
01:03:40,443 --> 01:03:42,443
You have just increased the power of the kick.

1804
01:03:42,903 --> 01:03:44,072
You just...

1805
01:03:44,073 --> 01:03:45,842
I've worked out for 30 years,

1806
01:03:45,843 --> 01:03:47,312
kicking the punching bag.

1807
01:03:47,313 --> 01:03:49,582
So it hurts my feelings when I hear something like that.

1808
01:03:49,583 --> 01:03:51,743
(It's as if his 30 years as an athlete was neglected.)

1809
01:03:51,983 --> 01:03:53,083
So...

1810
01:03:53,423 --> 01:03:54,522
You have nothing in there. Okay.

1811
01:03:54,523 --> 01:03:55,683
So, I'll kick...

1812
01:03:56,476 --> 01:03:57,546
So...

1813
01:03:57,806 --> 01:03:58,975
You have nothing in there. Okay.

1814
01:03:58,976 --> 01:04:00,116
So, I'll kick...

1815
01:04:00,576 --> 01:04:02,046
(Nervous)

1816
01:04:05,786 --> 01:04:06,886
(Dropping)

1817
01:04:07,056 --> 01:04:08,655
(What is this?)

1818
01:04:08,656 --> 01:04:10,485
- He just...
- Come on.

1819
01:04:10,486 --> 01:04:13,025
(His neck has turned red from embarrassment and pain.)

1820
01:04:13,026 --> 01:04:14,995
Actually, Sung Hoon would bury you...

1821
01:04:14,996 --> 01:04:16,026
right here.

1822
01:04:16,426 --> 01:04:18,625
I just touched you, and that was it.

1823
01:04:18,626 --> 01:04:20,535
(I can't feel my legs, Dong Hyun.)

1824
01:04:20,536 --> 01:04:22,565
Hold on. It'll get better if you get kicked on the other side.

1825
01:04:22,566 --> 01:04:23,912
(I can't feel my legs, Dong Hyun.)

1826
01:04:23,936 --> 01:04:25,435
He couldn't even scream.

1827
01:04:25,436 --> 01:04:27,035
I guess it drains the strength out.

1828
01:04:27,036 --> 01:04:28,105
Didn't he...

1829
01:04:28,106 --> 01:04:29,235
Didn't he kick really hard?

1830
01:04:29,236 --> 01:04:30,645
- No.
- Look at him.

1831
01:04:30,646 --> 01:04:31,705
- It was similar.
- It wasn't hard.

1832
01:04:31,706 --> 01:04:33,246
- He didn't kick you that hard.
- No.

1833
01:04:33,646 --> 01:04:35,146
No, he kicked me like this.

1834
01:04:35,546 --> 01:04:37,062
- No, it didn't feel that way.
- I'm serious.

1835
01:04:37,086 --> 01:04:38,415
Like this. Wasn't it?

1836
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:39,445
No.

1837
01:04:39,446 --> 01:04:41,286
(Dumbfounded)

1838
01:04:41,356 --> 01:04:43,185
- Hold on.
- Pani Bottle, it'll hurt for days.

1839
01:04:43,186 --> 01:04:44,726
- Take a seat.
- It really hurts.

1840
01:04:45,326 --> 01:04:47,206
Do you feel for the ones who got beaten by him?

1841
01:04:47,456 --> 01:04:48,595
No. I think it's unfair.

1842
01:04:48,596 --> 01:04:50,296
- Why?
- He kicked me harder than them.

1843
01:04:50,966 --> 01:04:52,525
- No.
- No, it seemed fine.

1844
01:04:52,526 --> 01:04:54,235
It didn't feel that way. It felt similar to previous ones.

1845
01:04:54,236 --> 01:04:55,336
So, I'll kick...

1846
01:04:56,396 --> 01:04:58,466
(Do you see it now?)

1847
01:04:58,666 --> 01:05:00,906
It seemed he kicked you lightly.

1848
01:05:01,176 --> 01:05:02,576
Well, now.

1849
01:05:02,876 --> 01:05:05,045
- Hand me the plate for the food.
- Okay.

1850
01:05:05,046 --> 01:05:06,046
I need to keep the promise.

1851
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,452
- Grab some chives.
- Give me a plate.

1852
01:05:07,476 --> 01:05:10,145
- I'll eat as much as you give me.
- Okay.

1853
01:05:10,146 --> 01:05:12,066
- I should give you a lot.
- Gosh. Look at that.

1854
01:05:13,616 --> 01:05:14,915
I put a little bit of sauce too.

1855
01:05:14,916 --> 01:05:16,756
(Adding lots of chives that Pani Bottle loves)

1856
01:05:16,786 --> 01:05:17,825
- These are unused.
- Thank you.

1857
01:05:17,826 --> 01:05:19,085
- I have chopsticks here.
- These are unused.

1858
01:05:19,086 --> 01:05:20,125
Okay.

1859
01:05:20,126 --> 01:05:21,996
(Taking in joy after pain)

1860
01:05:22,926 --> 01:05:25,165
(Trying the turkey after a while)

1861
01:05:25,166 --> 01:05:26,596
Yes. Those chives...

1862
01:05:26,836 --> 01:05:28,335
- It looks so good.
- He's tasting nostalgia.

1863
01:05:28,336 --> 01:05:30,305
- It's the nostalgic flavor.
- It's the nostalgic flavor.

1864
01:05:30,306 --> 01:05:31,505
It hasn't changed.

1865
01:05:31,506 --> 01:05:32,665
- Is it the same?
- Yes.

1866
01:05:32,666 --> 01:05:34,236
(It's the same.)

1867
01:05:34,706 --> 01:05:37,575
You got to eat after getting a low kick.

1868
01:05:37,576 --> 01:05:39,075
Was it worth it?

1869
01:05:39,076 --> 01:05:40,475
From now on, I'll get beaten before eating...

1870
01:05:40,476 --> 01:05:41,515
because it tastes so good.

1871
01:05:41,516 --> 01:05:42,516
(Deliciousness is in proportion to the pain.)

1872
01:05:42,517 --> 01:05:44,245
Things taste best after a tough work, don't they?

1873
01:05:44,246 --> 01:05:45,886
I'll ask the person next to me to hit me.

1874
01:05:45,946 --> 01:05:51,686
(His appetite is on fire thanks to Dong Hyun.)

1875
01:05:52,056 --> 01:05:53,255
- It's tofu with kimchi.
- Gosh.

1876
01:05:53,256 --> 01:05:54,855
It's a dish we have to order.

1877
01:05:54,856 --> 01:05:57,165
The meat is sticking out.

1878
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:59,666
- Take a look at this.
- Look at this.

1879
01:06:00,436 --> 01:06:02,195
- "Rolled omelet." - The letters look nice too.

1880
01:06:02,196 --> 01:06:03,766
This is their signature.

1881
01:06:03,836 --> 01:06:05,165
When you come here,

1882
01:06:05,166 --> 01:06:06,235
and if you're a ceramic major,

1883
01:06:06,236 --> 01:06:07,936
they'd write "ceramic design."

1884
01:06:08,276 --> 01:06:10,596
- They write your name too.
- It's nice handwriting. Look.

1885
01:06:11,046 --> 01:06:12,905
Gosh. The portion is big.

1886
01:06:12,906 --> 01:06:14,315
It's so heavy.

1887
01:06:14,316 --> 01:06:16,685
(Handwriting is one thing, but look at their portions.)

1888
01:06:16,686 --> 01:06:20,115
Since Pani Bottle is our guest,

1889
01:06:20,116 --> 01:06:21,755
if you want, you can get...

1890
01:06:21,756 --> 01:06:23,485
an arm bar for this, and a chokehold for this.

1891
01:06:23,486 --> 01:06:24,555
(Experience a chokehold or an arm bar.)

1892
01:06:24,556 --> 01:06:26,656
And Kimura for this one. Choose what you like.

1893
01:06:26,726 --> 01:06:28,495
I wouldn't be able to eat after fainting from a chokehold.

1894
01:06:28,496 --> 01:06:30,396
I'll wake you up before you faint.

1895
01:06:30,596 --> 01:06:32,242
- Before you faint...
- Do I eat before I faint?

1896
01:06:32,266 --> 01:06:33,765
I'll choke like this...

1897
01:06:33,766 --> 01:06:35,436
- and let you go.
- He'll choke.

1898
01:06:35,836 --> 01:06:39,406
(In the meantime, Yi Kyung takes a bite of the rolled omelet.)

1899
01:06:39,866 --> 01:06:41,176
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

1900
01:06:41,736 --> 01:06:43,945
The rolled omelet is faithful to the basics.

1901
01:06:43,946 --> 01:06:46,146
- Eggs are so expensive these days.
- Do you need this?

1902
01:06:46,376 --> 01:06:48,046
When they serve this much,

1903
01:06:48,576 --> 01:06:49,915
it means they want the college kids...

1904
01:06:49,916 --> 01:06:52,216
without money to fill their stomachs.

1905
01:06:53,186 --> 01:06:59,426
(In fact, it's hard to grab a piece at once because it's so heavy.)

1906
01:06:59,856 --> 01:07:04,226
(It's also filled with toppings.)

1907
01:07:04,826 --> 01:07:07,595
Because they serve in big portions, I wonder...

1908
01:07:07,596 --> 01:07:09,935
if they're making any profits.

1909
01:07:09,936 --> 01:07:11,735
- Prices are high these days.
- Right. It's a big portion.

1910
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,605
- It's really big in portion.
- They give lots of food.

1911
01:07:13,606 --> 01:07:15,935
When you're in college, price matters.

1912
01:07:15,936 --> 01:07:17,576
- Yes.
- Back in the days,

1913
01:07:17,676 --> 01:07:19,346
some came here to have a meal.

1914
01:07:19,576 --> 01:07:20,845
They didn't come for the drinks but the food.

1915
01:07:20,846 --> 01:07:22,715
Yes. Someone like me doesn't drink.

1916
01:07:22,716 --> 01:07:24,386
So, I'd come here to eat.

1917
01:07:25,116 --> 01:07:29,756
(Tae Hyun takes a piece of the fluffy rolled omelet.)

1918
01:07:30,456 --> 01:07:33,696
(Putting the big piece into his mouth)

1919
01:07:34,056 --> 01:07:37,665
(Quietly savoring it)

1920
01:07:37,666 --> 01:07:38,825
(This one)

1921
01:07:38,826 --> 01:07:40,765
The rolled omelet is tasty.

1922
01:07:40,766 --> 01:07:41,795
It's tasty.

1923
01:07:41,796 --> 01:07:43,435
(No need to add more.)

1924
01:07:43,436 --> 01:07:44,636
It tastes good.

1925
01:07:46,236 --> 01:07:48,605
It tastes...

1926
01:07:48,606 --> 01:07:51,905
like the old-school rolled omelet that I had in traditional bars...

1927
01:07:51,906 --> 01:07:53,046
when I was in college

1928
01:07:54,046 --> 01:07:56,615
This is premium quality for a college town.

1929
01:07:56,616 --> 01:07:57,846
This is interesting.

1930
01:07:58,746 --> 01:07:59,785
(Dong Hyun goes for kimchi jeon.)

1931
01:07:59,786 --> 01:08:01,155
Look. It's crazy.

1932
01:08:01,156 --> 01:08:02,555
It's round like it was injected.

1933
01:08:02,556 --> 01:08:03,686
It does.

1934
01:08:04,486 --> 01:08:06,056
The kimchi jeon is really thick.

1935
01:08:06,326 --> 01:08:07,525
- I know.
- Gosh. It's crazy.

1936
01:08:07,526 --> 01:08:08,596
It's crunchy.

1937
01:08:09,926 --> 01:08:11,426
Gosh. It's so thick.

1938
01:08:11,896 --> 01:08:14,296
Don't you want to try it?

1939
01:08:14,736 --> 01:08:15,795
- For a chokehold.
- It looks good.

1940
01:08:15,796 --> 01:08:17,836
- You'll kick my butt.
- No.

1941
01:08:18,466 --> 01:08:22,006
(I'll handle the item myself.)

1942
01:08:22,806 --> 01:08:28,745
(Kimchi never lets you down.)

1943
01:08:28,746 --> 01:08:29,916
Gosh. Kimchi jeon.

1944
01:08:30,746 --> 01:08:34,115
(Tae Hyun blows it and takes a bite.)

1945
01:08:34,116 --> 01:08:35,315
It looks good.

1946
01:08:35,316 --> 01:08:36,886
(Tae Hyun blows it and takes a bite.)

1947
01:08:37,126 --> 01:08:42,196
(Yi Kyung tries the part with cheese.)

1948
01:08:44,266 --> 01:08:47,996
(Amazed silently)

1949
01:08:48,096 --> 01:08:49,736
It's so crunchy.

1950
01:08:50,236 --> 01:08:52,265
When it's crunchy, the kimchi is... You know?

1951
01:08:52,266 --> 01:08:54,005
Kimchi is aged quite a bit,

1952
01:08:54,006 --> 01:08:55,276
so it has a tang.

1953
01:08:55,806 --> 01:08:58,775
Because kimchi is tasty, it's really good.

1954
01:08:58,776 --> 01:09:00,052
The tofu with kimchi is crazy too.

1955
01:09:00,076 --> 01:09:01,675
Because of the sourness,

1956
01:09:01,676 --> 01:09:03,015
- my jaw is stinging.
- Yes.

1957
01:09:03,016 --> 01:09:04,085
It's so sour.

1958
01:09:04,086 --> 01:09:07,386
(They really want to eat them.)

1959
01:09:09,986 --> 01:09:11,356
Dong Hyun,

1960
01:09:12,056 --> 01:09:15,056
why don't you give them a quiz on the UFC?

1961
01:09:15,296 --> 01:09:17,365
The one who gets it right can try the food.

1962
01:09:17,366 --> 01:09:19,166
There are many rules people don't know about.

1963
01:09:19,326 --> 01:09:21,266
- Give a quiz on them.
- That sounds good.

1964
01:09:21,366 --> 01:09:22,886
- The rules they wouldn't know.
- Yes.

1965
01:09:23,706 --> 01:09:25,235
In UFC,

1966
01:09:25,236 --> 01:09:26,766
during a fight between the fighters,

1967
01:09:27,276 --> 01:09:28,335
they can...

1968
01:09:28,336 --> 01:09:30,675
hold their own hands.

1969
01:09:30,676 --> 01:09:32,245
- Of these options...
- Hold their own hands?

1970
01:09:32,246 --> 01:09:33,816
What are allowed?

1971
01:09:34,246 --> 01:09:35,645
- Hold their own hands?
- What?

1972
01:09:35,646 --> 01:09:37,146
Hold their own hands like this?

1973
01:09:37,616 --> 01:09:39,256
Either the opponent's or their own hands.

1974
01:09:39,686 --> 01:09:42,116
The opponent's. When they hold the opponent's hand.

1975
01:09:42,916 --> 01:09:45,285
Why would they hold their hands during a fight?

1976
01:09:45,286 --> 01:09:46,286
(What?)

1977
01:09:46,386 --> 01:09:48,355
Hold on. I have a question.

1978
01:09:48,356 --> 01:09:49,695
Is there anyone who understood the question?

1979
01:09:49,696 --> 01:09:52,025
- I don't understand it either.
- He means...

1980
01:09:52,026 --> 01:09:54,135
I thought I was the only one who didn't get it. I'm relieved.

1981
01:09:54,136 --> 01:09:55,165
I got it.

1982
01:09:55,166 --> 01:09:57,136
- I told you.
- I got it.

1983
01:09:57,166 --> 01:09:58,605
Dong Hyun, please...

1984
01:09:58,606 --> 01:10:00,576
Dong Hyun, tell me.

1985
01:10:00,606 --> 01:10:02,126
This is a multiple-choice quiz, right?

1986
01:10:02,236 --> 01:10:03,745
- It's a multiple-choice quiz.
- Then it's okay.

1987
01:10:03,746 --> 01:10:06,046
I just need to choose a number. Okay.

1988
01:10:06,206 --> 01:10:07,245
Okay.

1989
01:10:07,246 --> 01:10:09,116
(Please wait. Let me think it through.)

1990
01:10:09,676 --> 01:10:11,115
Of many choices,

1991
01:10:11,116 --> 01:10:12,385
choose what's not a foul.

1992
01:10:12,386 --> 01:10:13,585
- That's not a foul.
- Not a foul.

1993
01:10:13,586 --> 01:10:15,185
- Not a foul.
- It's during the fight.

1994
01:10:15,186 --> 01:10:17,686
Grabbing the cage during the fight.

1995
01:10:17,756 --> 01:10:19,055
- Okay.
- That's Number One.

1996
01:10:19,056 --> 01:10:20,125
Number Two is...

1997
01:10:20,126 --> 01:10:21,355
(1. Grabbing the cage)

1998
01:10:21,356 --> 01:10:22,655
interwining your fingers...

1999
01:10:22,656 --> 01:10:24,066
with the opponent's like this.

2000
01:10:24,426 --> 01:10:25,895
Holding hands like this.

2001
01:10:25,896 --> 01:10:27,366
- That was Number Two.
- And...

2002
01:10:27,936 --> 01:10:29,036
Number Three.

2003
01:10:29,166 --> 01:10:30,965
Holding the opponent's hand...

2004
01:10:30,966 --> 01:10:32,135
like this.

2005
01:10:32,136 --> 01:10:33,675
Holding the opponent's three fingers.

2006
01:10:33,676 --> 01:10:35,152
(3. Holding the opponent's three fingers.)

2007
01:10:35,176 --> 01:10:36,975
- I got it. Number Three.
- What's not a foul?

2008
01:10:36,976 --> 01:10:38,145
- What's not a foul.
- Not a foul.

2009
01:10:38,146 --> 01:10:39,475
- Number 3.
- I'll go with Number 1.

2010
01:10:39,476 --> 01:10:41,175
What was Number One?

2011
01:10:41,176 --> 01:10:42,845
- Grabbing the cage.
- Right.

2012
01:10:42,846 --> 01:10:45,015
(How can a quiz giver forget about it?)

2013
01:10:45,016 --> 01:10:46,045
The rules are...

2014
01:10:46,046 --> 01:10:47,685
The rule book is this thick.

2015
01:10:47,686 --> 01:10:48,985
- Yes. And?
- So...

2016
01:10:48,986 --> 01:10:50,355
I chose Number Three.

2017
01:10:50,356 --> 01:10:51,686
Number 3 and Number 1.

2018
01:10:52,086 --> 01:10:53,595
- Then he's Number 2.
- I'll choose Number 2.

2019
01:10:53,596 --> 01:10:54,896
What was Number Two?

2020
01:10:55,026 --> 01:10:56,595
(That's right.)

2021
01:10:56,596 --> 01:10:57,925
One of them got the answer, right?

2022
01:10:57,926 --> 01:10:59,626
Yes, he did. Okay.

2023
01:11:00,126 --> 01:11:01,435
- Number Three?
- I might have seen them...

2024
01:11:01,436 --> 01:11:02,735
with intertwined fingers.

2025
01:11:02,736 --> 01:11:04,182
- Like this?
- Grabbing three fingers.

2026
01:11:04,206 --> 01:11:05,266
- This?
- Yes.

2027
01:11:05,306 --> 01:11:06,906
- It's allowed.
- Okay.

2028
01:11:07,006 --> 01:11:08,035
- You're eliminated.
- Is that okay?

2029
01:11:08,036 --> 01:11:09,335
- He got it.
- I knew about it.

2030
01:11:09,336 --> 01:11:10,676
You were incorrect.

2031
01:11:10,706 --> 01:11:12,006
You were incorrect.

2032
01:11:12,606 --> 01:11:13,875
Isn't it correct?

2033
01:11:13,876 --> 01:11:16,045
You told us to choose what's not a foul.

2034
01:11:16,046 --> 01:11:17,615
Did I say that?

2035
01:11:17,616 --> 01:11:19,946
(Did I tell you to choose what's not a foul?)

2036
01:11:20,246 --> 01:11:23,155
(You're making us very confused.)

2037
01:11:23,156 --> 01:11:24,825
- Right. The one that's not a foul.
- The remaining two are foul.

2038
01:11:24,826 --> 01:11:26,755
- Hold on. Did I say that?
- Yes.

2039
01:11:26,756 --> 01:11:28,496
There's one more answer.

2040
01:11:28,526 --> 01:11:30,465
- Another one is not a foul.
- Okay.

2041
01:11:30,466 --> 01:11:31,925
- There's one more.
- I'm glad to hear that.

2042
01:11:31,926 --> 01:11:33,065
- Good.
- I said the opposite.

2043
01:11:33,066 --> 01:11:34,095
You still didn't get it, did you?

2044
01:11:34,096 --> 01:11:35,935
It's okay for now.

2045
01:11:35,936 --> 01:11:37,905
- Wait. There's one that's a foul.
- I see.

2046
01:11:37,906 --> 01:11:39,735
- One of them is a foul.
- Okay. There's one left.

2047
01:11:39,736 --> 01:11:41,705
Between Number 1 and Number 2, one is a foul.

2048
01:11:41,706 --> 01:11:44,545
The answer is grabbing the cage, which is a foul.

2049
01:11:44,546 --> 01:11:45,845
(Number 1, grabbing the cage, is a foul.)

2050
01:11:45,846 --> 01:11:48,415
- The referees always separate them.
- This is a foul.

2051
01:11:48,416 --> 01:11:50,985
If you grab the cage with your fingers...

2052
01:11:50,986 --> 01:11:52,315
or toes, it's a foul.

2053
01:11:52,316 --> 01:11:54,115
(Since they can escape a takedown by grabbing the cage, )

2054
01:11:54,116 --> 01:11:56,115
(a repetitive and deliberate grabbing results in a loss.)

2055
01:11:56,116 --> 01:11:57,425
Is it okay to touch the cage?

2056
01:11:57,426 --> 01:11:59,425
That's okay when you touch it like this.

2057
01:11:59,426 --> 01:12:02,032
It's okay when your sole touches it. Once your toe is in, it's a foul.

2058
01:12:02,056 --> 01:12:03,996
The referee comes and hits you to take it out.

2059
01:12:04,326 --> 01:12:05,466
Really?

2060
01:12:06,296 --> 01:12:08,235
- Is it okay to intertwine fingers?
- That's allowed.

2061
01:12:08,236 --> 01:12:09,365
- That's okay.
- I've seen it many times.

2062
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:12,405
If you grab a finger like this, it's a foul.

2063
01:12:12,406 --> 01:12:15,175
- If you grab one and fold it.
- Yes, that's a foul.

2064
01:12:15,176 --> 01:12:16,582
Grabbing two fingers is also a foul.

2065
01:12:16,606 --> 01:12:18,086
If you grab three or more, it's okay.

2066
01:12:18,376 --> 01:12:20,716
You can grab three fingers like this or like this.

2067
01:12:21,276 --> 01:12:22,956
- Just three fingers.
- Or even like this.

2068
01:12:23,046 --> 01:12:24,245
Grabbing three fingers is allowed.

2069
01:12:24,246 --> 01:12:26,145
How can a referee see that?

2070
01:12:26,146 --> 01:12:27,456
- They know it.
- Gosh.

2071
01:12:27,986 --> 01:12:29,615
Anyway, those two can eat.

2072
01:12:29,616 --> 01:12:31,386
- Hurry and eat.
- Yes, those two.

2073
01:12:31,626 --> 01:12:33,585
I don't know how to give a quiz.

2074
01:12:33,586 --> 01:12:35,002
(He's unsatisfied with his first quiz.)

2075
01:12:35,026 --> 01:12:36,495
- Try it.
- It's really good.

2076
01:12:36,496 --> 01:12:38,165
- Help yourself.
- This... Take the big meat.

2077
01:12:38,166 --> 01:12:40,126
Please eat them for us because there is too much.

2078
01:12:40,366 --> 01:12:42,636
- This is the tasty part.
- You're right.

2079
01:12:43,166 --> 01:12:45,636
- Have the part with the skin on.
- You're right.

2080
01:12:45,706 --> 01:12:47,375
I won't be greedy. I'll eat this much.

2081
01:12:47,376 --> 01:12:48,856
We'd like you to take lots of chives.

2082
01:12:50,036 --> 01:12:52,945
(Sang Uk grabs a large amount of the chives first.)

2083
01:12:52,946 --> 01:12:54,975
It feels like they gave us...

2084
01:12:54,976 --> 01:12:56,576
a bunch of the chives.

2085
01:12:56,976 --> 01:12:58,446
It has so many chives.

2086
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:01,455
When we were in college,

2087
01:13:01,456 --> 01:13:03,055
we were always hungry,

2088
01:13:03,056 --> 01:13:05,625
but we couldn't finish the turkey since it was so big.

2089
01:13:05,626 --> 01:13:07,802
(The amount was big enough for the hungry college students.)

2090
01:13:07,826 --> 01:13:12,796
(Taking a big bite)

2091
01:13:23,006 --> 01:13:27,146
(It tastes amazingly good.)

2092
01:13:29,146 --> 01:13:31,316
I thought a turkey was a bird with muscles.

2093
01:13:31,486 --> 01:13:33,916
It indeed has muscles and is high in protein.

2094
01:13:34,356 --> 01:13:37,015
But it isn't tough to chew. It's still tender and moist...

2095
01:13:37,016 --> 01:13:38,296
while it was served a while ago.

2096
01:13:38,656 --> 01:13:40,955
In my opinion, the chives...

2097
01:13:40,956 --> 01:13:42,925
are really flavorful.

2098
01:13:42,926 --> 01:13:43,926
(Sang Uk is captivated by the tasty chives.)

2099
01:13:43,927 --> 01:13:46,242
When I had them at other places, they were only flavorful.

2100
01:13:46,266 --> 01:13:48,266
But since these are seasoned well,

2101
01:13:49,296 --> 01:13:52,266
- It's really well seasoned.
- it doesn't feel oily at all.

2102
01:13:55,506 --> 01:13:58,806
Right. The customers will come once we leave, won't they?

2103
01:13:59,506 --> 01:14:02,546
Gosh. This rolled omelet is awesome.

2104
01:14:03,246 --> 01:14:08,016
(The customers start to wait as the opening hours approach.)

2105
01:14:08,116 --> 01:14:11,125
For the students,

2106
01:14:11,126 --> 01:14:12,985
they can't help but come here.

2107
01:14:12,986 --> 01:14:14,026
Exactly.

2108
01:14:14,126 --> 01:14:17,565
Now I understand why they have...

2109
01:14:17,566 --> 01:14:18,625
- so many kinds of drinks.
- Yes.

2110
01:14:18,626 --> 01:14:21,165
Yes. This is a bar.

2111
01:14:21,166 --> 01:14:23,166
"Should we drink this with these dishes?"

2112
01:14:23,436 --> 01:14:25,536
When you're attending a school,

2113
01:14:25,606 --> 01:14:28,436
there are good days and bad days. One day, you might break up.

2114
01:14:28,636 --> 01:14:31,352
One day, you took the exam well. There are so many reasons to drink.

2115
01:14:31,376 --> 01:14:34,516
That's why you drink every day.

2116
01:14:34,576 --> 01:14:36,615
You have a different drink, depending on the day.

2117
01:14:36,616 --> 01:14:38,545
Everything that happens on campus is an excuse to drink.

2118
01:14:38,546 --> 01:14:39,845
- You're right.
- Yes.

2119
01:14:39,846 --> 01:14:42,115
When something went well, you drink for that and vice versa.

2120
01:14:42,116 --> 01:14:43,116
You're right.

2121
01:14:43,117 --> 01:14:44,585
On rainy days, you drink because it's raining.

2122
01:14:44,586 --> 01:14:46,855
(Because it was cloudy)

2123
01:14:46,856 --> 01:14:49,295
When there's nothing, you drink because there's nothing.

2124
01:14:49,296 --> 01:14:50,496
(Because it was sunny)

2125
01:14:50,666 --> 01:14:52,866
When you received the tuition, you drank because of it.

2126
01:14:53,226 --> 01:14:54,495
If you didn't, you drank because you felt sad.

2127
01:14:54,496 --> 01:14:56,636
(On happy days and sad days)

2128
01:14:57,166 --> 01:14:58,705
That's the fun of it.

2129
01:14:58,706 --> 01:15:00,936
(Every moment they had here was brilliant.)

2130
01:15:01,406 --> 01:15:02,505
- What?
- Thank you.

2131
01:15:02,506 --> 01:15:03,735
(It's time to pay before they know it.)

2132
01:15:03,736 --> 01:15:04,905
It's 81 dollars.

2133
01:15:04,906 --> 01:15:06,375
- What?
- I told you.

2134
01:15:06,376 --> 01:15:08,296
- That's so cheap.
- Is it not even 100 dollars?

2135
01:15:08,476 --> 01:15:09,745
Give us the quiz now.

2136
01:15:09,746 --> 01:15:10,746
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

2137
01:15:10,747 --> 01:15:11,945
It's 81 dollars.

2138
01:15:11,946 --> 01:15:13,786
- Let's get it.
- I have a good feeling today.

2139
01:15:13,956 --> 01:15:15,715
In the early 1990s,

2140
01:15:15,716 --> 01:15:18,426
there was a unique blind dating culture...

2141
01:15:18,826 --> 01:15:22,996
in downtown Seoul and college towns for the young generation.

2142
01:15:23,296 --> 01:15:24,765
Blind dates for the young generation.

2143
01:15:24,766 --> 01:15:27,565
This was installed for blind dates,

2144
01:15:27,566 --> 01:15:31,036
but it could be only used by women.

2145
01:15:31,236 --> 01:15:35,836
What is this that was a big hit back then?

2146
01:15:36,636 --> 01:15:39,975
- Here's an article about it.
- For a blind date?

2147
01:15:39,976 --> 01:15:42,576
- An article?
- We have lots of information.

2148
01:15:43,676 --> 01:15:46,516
"Choose the guy you like from this."

2149
01:15:46,946 --> 01:15:49,085
"For 50 cents,"

2150
01:15:49,086 --> 01:15:50,726
"you get the info about the guy."

2151
01:15:51,026 --> 01:15:53,385
"Ten couples tied the knot. Some worry for commercialization."

2152
01:15:53,386 --> 01:15:55,756
(Choose the guy you like from this.)

2153
01:15:55,896 --> 01:15:59,765
We have to choose something that requires 50 cents.

2154
01:15:59,766 --> 01:16:01,996
What could they do with 50 cents back then?

2155
01:16:02,266 --> 01:16:03,735
Choose a guy from a fortuneteller's place?

2156
01:16:03,736 --> 01:16:04,935
(A fortuneteller's place?)

2157
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:07,376
- Fortune reading wasn't 50 cents.
- I mean...

2158
01:16:07,506 --> 01:16:11,005
At that time, it was 50 cents...

2159
01:16:11,006 --> 01:16:12,746
to sing at a karaoke.

2160
01:16:13,206 --> 01:16:15,175
"Karaoke." It doesn't fit in the blank.

2161
01:16:15,176 --> 01:16:16,176
It's a two-letter word.

2162
01:16:16,616 --> 01:16:19,146
A fortuneteller's place or something else.

2163
01:16:19,916 --> 01:16:21,215
(Thinking)

2164
01:16:21,216 --> 01:16:22,756
Saju, the fate.

2165
01:16:24,086 --> 01:16:25,455
(I think it can fit.)

2166
01:16:25,456 --> 01:16:26,456
It's a two-letter word.

2167
01:16:27,756 --> 01:16:29,855
(Measuring meticulously)

2168
01:16:29,856 --> 01:16:31,525
Look. It fits right in.

2169
01:16:31,526 --> 01:16:32,766
It can fit a three-letter word.

2170
01:16:32,926 --> 01:16:34,342
- Karaoke?
- A three-letter word can fit.

2171
01:16:34,366 --> 01:16:35,636
Yes. It can fit.

2172
01:16:36,436 --> 01:16:37,736
- But...
- It was 50 cents.

2173
01:16:38,306 --> 01:16:41,075
At the karaoke... Last time...

2174
01:16:41,076 --> 01:16:42,306
- The info.
- No, I mean...

2175
01:16:42,476 --> 01:16:46,375
They used to have a machine...

2176
01:16:46,376 --> 01:16:47,415
(There was a machine to print out your fortune.)

2177
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:50,375
where you can print out your fortune and stuff.

2178
01:16:50,376 --> 01:16:52,716
Each table had it where you put the coin in.

2179
01:16:53,316 --> 01:16:55,316
Tarot cards? Was it a tarot-reading place?

2180
01:16:56,016 --> 01:16:57,056
Tarot cards?

2181
01:16:57,456 --> 01:17:02,226
It doesn't mean that only women could use this place, does it?

2182
01:17:03,026 --> 01:17:05,565
This was installed for blind dates,

2183
01:17:05,566 --> 01:17:06,872
but it could only be used by women.

2184
01:17:06,896 --> 01:17:08,635
This was installed for blind dates.

2185
01:17:08,636 --> 01:17:09,665
"Installed."

2186
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:12,435
So, it's a thing, not a place.

2187
01:17:12,436 --> 01:17:13,936
It's a machine.

2188
01:17:14,176 --> 01:17:16,005
- A vending machine.
- A toy capsule dispenser?

2189
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:18,545
- Yes. Vending machines.
- Capsule dispensers.

2190
01:17:18,546 --> 01:17:20,545
If they installed it, it's a vending machine.

2191
01:17:20,546 --> 01:17:23,516
And a vending machine makes a good headline.

2192
01:17:23,876 --> 01:17:25,676
Choose a guy you like from a vending machine.

2193
01:17:26,216 --> 01:17:27,755
- Okay.
- Okay?

2194
01:17:27,756 --> 01:17:29,076
If it's incorrect, you pay. Okay?

2195
01:17:30,056 --> 01:17:32,185
(Me?)

2196
01:17:32,186 --> 01:17:33,326
- Suddenly?
- Yes.

2197
01:17:33,856 --> 01:17:36,555
Okay. We got it. It's a vending machine.

2198
01:17:36,556 --> 01:17:37,595
(Vending machines)

2199
01:17:37,596 --> 01:17:39,026
Choose from a vending machine.

2200
01:17:39,626 --> 01:17:40,626
Correct.

2201
01:17:40,627 --> 01:17:42,666
(Vending machines)

2202
01:17:43,536 --> 01:17:45,166
- Gosh.
- I'm getting everything right.

2203
01:17:45,266 --> 01:17:46,906
Really? What's going on today?

2204
01:17:47,536 --> 01:17:49,475
- Yes.
- I mean...

2205
01:17:49,476 --> 01:17:53,505
The vending machine for blind dates installed in 1992.

2206
01:17:53,506 --> 01:17:55,266
A vending machine for blind dates. Goodness.

2207
01:17:55,616 --> 01:17:58,485
When a man sends his profile with a joining fee of five dollars...

2208
01:17:58,486 --> 01:18:01,785
to the vending machine company,

2209
01:18:01,786 --> 01:18:04,285
the company put the profile...

2210
01:18:04,286 --> 01:18:05,686
in the vending machine.

2211
01:18:06,526 --> 01:18:09,756
Later, women insert 50 cents to the vending machine...

2212
01:18:09,896 --> 01:18:14,095
and chose the man they wanted to date and pushed the button.

2213
01:18:14,096 --> 01:18:17,035
- And the guy's profile came out.
- His profile came out.

2214
01:18:17,036 --> 01:18:18,706
If she liked his profile,

2215
01:18:18,736 --> 01:18:21,306
she called the phone number to go on a date.

2216
01:18:21,806 --> 01:18:23,635
It was the time when there were no apps.

2217
01:18:23,636 --> 01:18:24,975
(They called the phone number to date.)

2218
01:18:24,976 --> 01:18:26,845
That means Pani might pay again.

2219
01:18:26,846 --> 01:18:28,245
(Now, it's an individual quiz for the final payer.)

2220
01:18:28,246 --> 01:18:29,645
- Pani.
- No way.

2221
01:18:29,646 --> 01:18:32,186
- He can't be the one.
- That doesn't make sense.

2222
01:18:33,416 --> 01:18:36,116
It's a quiz on a famous quote that's a bit hard.

2223
01:18:36,816 --> 01:18:41,426
"There are only two ways of telling the complete truth,"

2224
01:18:41,456 --> 01:18:44,195
"A and B."

2225
01:18:44,196 --> 01:18:46,265
(By Thomas Sowell)

2226
01:18:46,266 --> 01:18:48,636
They can guess either A or B.

2227
01:18:48,736 --> 01:18:49,865
They don't have to get both.

2228
01:18:49,866 --> 01:18:51,966
- If they get one, it's a pass.
- Yes, for this one.

2229
01:18:52,906 --> 01:18:54,006
I got it.

2230
01:18:54,836 --> 01:18:55,836
Imagination.

2231
01:18:56,106 --> 01:18:57,106
Incorrect.

2232
01:18:58,506 --> 01:18:59,576
I got it.

2233
01:19:00,606 --> 01:19:01,815
Proving.

2234
01:19:01,816 --> 01:19:03,045
- What?
- What?

2235
01:19:03,046 --> 01:19:05,115
By proving? Incorrect.

2236
01:19:05,116 --> 01:19:06,546
You don't get the point.

2237
01:19:07,916 --> 01:19:10,385
I got it. By actions.

2238
01:19:10,386 --> 01:19:11,925
(By actions)

2239
01:19:11,926 --> 01:19:13,355
- It's a tough one.
- Incorrect.

2240
01:19:13,356 --> 01:19:14,456
- We need a hint.
- Yes.

2241
01:19:15,256 --> 01:19:19,865
When you try to reveal a truth in society,

2242
01:19:19,866 --> 01:19:22,566
this is a way to get the word out.

2243
01:19:23,066 --> 01:19:24,136
I got it. By sacrificing.

2244
01:19:24,306 --> 01:19:25,336
Incorrect.

2245
01:19:26,106 --> 01:19:27,335
I got it. Through the last will.

2246
01:19:27,336 --> 01:19:30,305
(Will)

2247
01:19:30,306 --> 01:19:31,306
Pani Bottle is correct.

2248
01:19:33,246 --> 01:19:34,946
That's the vibe. It's dark.

2249
01:19:35,446 --> 01:19:36,745
It was related to death.

2250
01:19:36,746 --> 01:19:38,585
(Pani Bottle avoids paying three times.)

2251
01:19:38,586 --> 01:19:39,946
Keep going on that path.

2252
01:19:41,416 --> 01:19:43,516
I got it. Writing in blood.

2253
01:19:43,886 --> 01:19:46,826
It relates to when you give a tipoff to a social program.

2254
01:19:47,626 --> 01:19:49,455
I got it. Anonymously.

2255
01:19:49,456 --> 01:19:50,825
(Anonymously)

2256
01:19:50,826 --> 01:19:52,425
Anonymously. Correct.

2257
01:19:52,426 --> 01:19:54,165
(Anonymously)

2258
01:19:54,166 --> 01:19:55,666
- Was it anonymity?
- Anonymously.

2259
01:19:56,536 --> 01:19:58,035
It was hard to get the word.

2260
01:19:58,036 --> 01:19:59,405
Okay. Well done.

2261
01:19:59,406 --> 01:20:00,635
(It was a really hard quiz. It was worth playing for.)

2262
01:20:00,636 --> 01:20:02,675
- I'll pay for it.
- Okay. Thank you.

2263
01:20:02,676 --> 01:20:03,905
(Seung Ho is the final payer.)

2264
01:20:03,906 --> 01:20:05,176
- Thank you, Seung Ho.
- Yes.

2265
01:20:06,146 --> 01:20:07,175
(Total: 81 dollars)

2266
01:20:07,176 --> 01:20:08,745
- Do you need the receipt?
- No, it's all right.

2267
01:20:08,746 --> 01:20:09,775
- Thank you.
- I'll throw it away for you.

2268
01:20:09,776 --> 01:20:11,296
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

2269
01:20:11,346 --> 01:20:13,315
- Let's go to the makchang place.
- Yes.

2270
01:20:13,316 --> 01:20:15,355
- That was good.
- I think that will be good too.

2271
01:20:15,356 --> 01:20:16,356
We enjoyed the food so much.

2272
01:20:16,357 --> 01:20:17,762
(After enjoying the first memories, they move on to the next one.)

2273
01:20:17,786 --> 01:20:19,725
This is a camera crane.

2274
01:20:19,726 --> 01:20:21,526
They told the three of us to walk together.

2275
01:20:21,696 --> 01:20:23,425
I'm the oldest one out of the three, aren't I?

2276
01:20:23,426 --> 01:20:24,795
You're right.

2277
01:20:24,796 --> 01:20:25,996
(Born in 1996, 1987, and 1995)

2278
01:20:26,066 --> 01:20:27,166
It's scary.

2279
01:20:27,966 --> 01:20:29,795
- Is it close from here?
- It's close.

2280
01:20:29,796 --> 01:20:31,606
I think it'll take less than five minutes.

2281
01:20:31,736 --> 01:20:34,806
The Gyeongchun Line used to pass by.

2282
01:20:35,076 --> 01:20:36,396
Now, they've built a pretty spot.

2283
01:20:37,176 --> 01:20:38,806
It's quiet around here.

2284
01:20:39,806 --> 01:20:41,015
Look at the sunset. Gosh.

2285
01:20:41,016 --> 01:20:43,696
(They go to the next restaurant with the sunset as the background.)

2286
01:20:44,046 --> 01:20:45,646
How long did you live here?

2287
01:20:45,886 --> 01:20:48,456
I lived here for a year for my freshman year.

2288
01:20:48,716 --> 01:20:50,556
After serving in the military,

2289
01:20:50,656 --> 01:20:53,096
- I lived here for another 4 years.
- For 4 more, so 5 years.

2290
01:20:53,156 --> 01:20:55,125
Except for my hometown, I had lived here the longest.

2291
01:20:55,126 --> 01:20:56,525
(Pani's 20s are in Gongneung-dong.)

2292
01:20:56,526 --> 01:20:58,096
Nothing has changed.

2293
01:20:58,226 --> 01:21:00,165
I don't know what to say. It's the same.

2294
01:21:00,166 --> 01:21:01,735
- Are those apartments the same too?
- Yes.

2295
01:21:01,736 --> 01:21:03,235
Except for that new building,

2296
01:21:03,236 --> 01:21:04,306
nothing has changed.

2297
01:21:04,706 --> 01:21:08,006
This neighborhood is really quiet and pretty.

2298
01:21:08,506 --> 01:21:09,675
It's a good place to live in.

2299
01:21:09,676 --> 01:21:11,575
(The Jungnang Stream...)

2300
01:21:11,576 --> 01:21:13,976
(and Gyeongchun Line Forest Trail create a harmony.)

2301
01:21:14,916 --> 01:21:15,975
It feels good to live here.

2302
01:21:15,976 --> 01:21:18,336
(The neighborhood filled with Pani's memories as a student)

2303
01:21:18,746 --> 01:21:21,186
The crowd has increased.

2304
01:21:22,486 --> 01:21:25,285
(As it's time to get out of work)

2305
01:21:25,286 --> 01:21:27,626
They're taking a stroll...

2306
01:21:27,656 --> 01:21:28,726
before leaving work.

2307
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:33,065
(It's time to enjoy a delicious dinner...)

2308
01:21:33,066 --> 01:21:34,265
(with a glass of relaxing drinks.)

2309
01:21:34,266 --> 01:21:36,196
(A time to enjoy a delicious dinner with drinks)

2310
01:21:36,836 --> 01:21:38,535
I came to this sundae gukbap place often...

2311
01:21:38,536 --> 01:21:40,096
to cure hangovers after drinking a lot.

2312
01:21:40,436 --> 01:21:42,036
- It's open for 24 hours a day.
- Right.

2313
01:21:42,876 --> 01:21:44,645
- We take a right from here.
- Take a right.

2314
01:21:44,646 --> 01:21:45,722
- Right.
- It's Pani Bottle!

2315
01:21:45,746 --> 01:21:47,375
Hello.

2316
01:21:47,376 --> 01:21:48,945
- It's our senior!
- Thank you!

2317
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:50,575
- They know.
- Right.

2318
01:21:50,576 --> 01:21:52,545
I think they called you Water Bottle.

2319
01:21:52,546 --> 01:21:54,655
- Gosh.
- That's right too.

2320
01:21:54,656 --> 01:21:55,686
"Pani Bottle."

2321
01:21:55,716 --> 01:21:57,585
I don't get a response like this elsewhere.

2322
01:21:57,586 --> 01:21:59,385
- I do here at my alma mater.
- The son of Gongneung.

2323
01:21:59,386 --> 01:22:00,386
Hello.

2324
01:22:00,786 --> 01:22:02,196
Oh, hello.

2325
01:22:02,356 --> 01:22:03,726
- The son of Gongneung.
- Gosh.

2326
01:22:04,326 --> 01:22:06,102
- The grandson of Gongneung.
- The son of Gongneung.

2327
01:22:06,126 --> 01:22:07,265
Gongneung is my second hometown.

2328
01:22:07,266 --> 01:22:08,965
- It made me proud.
- As expected.

2329
01:22:08,966 --> 01:22:11,036
- Gongneung is your place.
- Right.

2330
01:22:11,836 --> 01:22:13,005
The son of Gongneung.

2331
01:22:13,006 --> 01:22:15,176
(They approve him as the son of Gongneung.)

2332
01:22:15,406 --> 01:22:17,075
Here is the tripe place.

2333
01:22:17,076 --> 01:22:18,145
- Right.
- I see.

2334
01:22:18,146 --> 01:22:19,176
It's this place?

2335
01:22:19,446 --> 01:22:21,476
- Hello.
- Hello.

2336
01:22:22,776 --> 01:22:25,846
(It's located at the center of Gongneung-dong...)

2337
01:22:26,586 --> 01:22:29,956
(and is a makchang restaurant that represents the area.)

2338
01:22:30,256 --> 01:22:34,355
(Anyone becomes a regular after their first visit.)

2339
01:22:34,356 --> 01:22:36,516
- It has been over 10 years, right?
- Around 15 years?

2340
01:22:36,656 --> 01:22:39,226
I came here since I was in high school.

2341
01:22:39,366 --> 01:22:40,795
With just one visit,

2342
01:22:40,796 --> 01:22:42,896
the owner remembers your face for a long time.

2343
01:22:43,296 --> 01:22:47,106
(The one dish that mesmerized the regulars)

2344
01:22:47,406 --> 01:22:52,176
(DMR 2, makchang)

2345
01:22:52,946 --> 01:22:54,045
The owner is here.

2346
01:22:54,046 --> 01:22:55,815
- Welcome.
- Hello.

2347
01:22:55,816 --> 01:22:56,976
It's great to see you.

2348
01:22:57,416 --> 01:22:58,945
- This is amazing.
- I'm doing well thanks to you.

2349
01:22:58,946 --> 01:23:00,485
- There's makeup on me. I'm sorry.
- Gosh.

2350
01:23:00,486 --> 01:23:02,656
- It's fascinating to see you all.
- Thank you.

2351
01:23:03,486 --> 01:23:05,425
I drew something on the wall.

2352
01:23:05,426 --> 01:23:07,926
- Look for it.
- There was something she removed.

2353
01:23:08,156 --> 01:23:10,256
- It's grilled in advance.
- This is awesome.

2354
01:23:11,726 --> 01:23:12,866
This is the real deal.

2355
01:23:13,296 --> 01:23:15,435
- This is the real deal.
- It's grilled in advance here.

2356
01:23:15,436 --> 01:23:16,835
(The athletic group gets amazed...)

2357
01:23:16,836 --> 01:23:18,516
(by the makchang seen through the window.)

2358
01:23:19,066 --> 01:23:21,236
Gosh, there are so many things written on the wall.

2359
01:23:21,736 --> 01:23:24,506
This is the interior design of a place in a university town.

2360
01:23:25,006 --> 01:23:28,046
The love story of a couple is all written out here.

2361
01:23:28,246 --> 01:23:30,346
They met in 2014...

2362
01:23:30,416 --> 01:23:32,215
and things were fine until their 160th day.

2363
01:23:32,216 --> 01:23:35,855
But the guy wrote that he became single in 2018.

2364
01:23:35,856 --> 01:23:37,556
(The two came to an end.)

2365
01:23:37,656 --> 01:23:39,386
Gosh. "Single."

2366
01:23:40,456 --> 01:23:42,625
(Famous sayings that shake up the heart)

2367
01:23:42,626 --> 01:23:44,225
"I like you, Kim Sung Soo."

2368
01:23:44,226 --> 01:23:46,566
(Honest and pure confessions)

2369
01:23:47,026 --> 01:23:48,236
That's pure.

2370
01:23:48,636 --> 01:23:51,365
I wonder how many couples there are that got married.

2371
01:23:51,366 --> 01:23:52,865
(That can't be known, )

2372
01:23:52,866 --> 01:23:54,235
I think there will be quite a lot.

2373
01:23:54,236 --> 01:23:56,382
(but it shows just how many people visited this place.)

2374
01:23:56,406 --> 01:23:58,846
Out of the restaurants we visited,

2375
01:23:59,246 --> 01:24:01,115
this place has the neatest menu.

2376
01:24:01,116 --> 01:24:02,146
Right.

2377
01:24:02,346 --> 01:24:03,745
"Salt grill, soju, and beer."

2378
01:24:03,746 --> 01:24:05,885
(There's just one food dish on the menu.)

2379
01:24:05,886 --> 01:24:08,156
You just need to ask for how many portions you need.

2380
01:24:08,256 --> 01:24:09,315
- That's all you need to ask for.
- Right.

2381
01:24:09,316 --> 01:24:10,855
There's nothing else to choose.

2382
01:24:10,856 --> 01:24:12,402
- "This many portions, please." - Right.

2383
01:24:12,426 --> 01:24:13,625
Let's bring over the owner...

2384
01:24:13,626 --> 01:24:15,326
and talk about your past.

2385
01:24:15,696 --> 01:24:17,595
- Aunt!
- Hello.

2386
01:24:17,596 --> 01:24:18,695
(Lim Mi, owner of Pani Bottle's favorite makchang place)

2387
01:24:18,696 --> 01:24:20,525
The restaurant wasn't originally here.

2388
01:24:20,526 --> 01:24:22,495
- Right. It was in the alley.
- It was in the alley closeby.

2389
01:24:22,496 --> 01:24:23,995
There were just two tables.

2390
01:24:23,996 --> 01:24:26,565
- I started with a very small place.
- Right. It was very small.

2391
01:24:26,566 --> 01:24:29,075
It has been around 15 years since I moved to this place.

2392
01:24:29,076 --> 01:24:32,476
Do you watch all of his shows?

2393
01:24:32,876 --> 01:24:34,146
I watched him go to Brazil.

2394
01:24:34,346 --> 01:24:36,515
- You two went across the waterfall.
- We went there together.

2395
01:24:36,516 --> 01:24:37,885
- Right. I watched the two of you.
- Right.

2396
01:24:37,886 --> 01:24:39,685
- She watched his show.
- You two were amazing.

2397
01:24:39,686 --> 01:24:40,745
She really watched your show.

2398
01:24:40,746 --> 01:24:42,315
(He has been proven to be a true regular.)

2399
01:24:42,316 --> 01:24:43,815
Have you ever been on a show?

2400
01:24:43,816 --> 01:24:44,985
No. Not even once.

2401
01:24:44,986 --> 01:24:46,455
I'm not interested in being on shows.

2402
01:24:46,456 --> 01:24:48,055
But how did you let us come?

2403
01:24:48,056 --> 01:24:49,256
Because of Pani.

2404
01:24:49,826 --> 01:24:50,925
- I...
- Well,

2405
01:24:50,926 --> 01:24:52,725
- Pani recommended this place...
- It was because of him?

2406
01:24:52,726 --> 01:24:54,695
And I couldn't go against him.

2407
01:24:54,696 --> 01:24:56,936
Even when I was a student,

2408
01:24:57,196 --> 01:24:59,005
she said she got a lot of offers, but she turned them all down.

2409
01:24:59,006 --> 01:25:00,136
- Right.
- Right.

2410
01:25:00,306 --> 01:25:02,105
Is there something different about this place...

2411
01:25:02,106 --> 01:25:04,106
from other makchang places?

2412
01:25:04,206 --> 01:25:05,805
Other places boil the makchang in water.

2413
01:25:05,806 --> 01:25:08,175
We work as a group of two...

2414
01:25:08,176 --> 01:25:10,256
and one person grills the fresh makchang in advance.

2415
01:25:10,946 --> 01:25:13,066
(The fresh makchang gets poured on top of the grill.)

2416
01:25:14,656 --> 01:25:17,616
(The fresh makchang gets grilled on a strong fire.)

2417
01:25:19,126 --> 01:25:22,126
(The makchang that was grilled in advance gets cut in circles.)

2418
01:25:23,626 --> 01:25:25,866
(It gets grilled one more time on the grill...)

2419
01:25:28,996 --> 01:25:31,536
(and this restaurant's special makchang is ready.)

2420
01:25:31,866 --> 01:25:33,335
- It's grilled and cut up.
- Then...

2421
01:25:33,336 --> 01:25:35,135
- it's not boiled at all?
- No.

2422
01:25:35,136 --> 01:25:36,235
That's the difference.

2423
01:25:36,236 --> 01:25:38,676
The makchang served here is especially thick.

2424
01:25:38,706 --> 01:25:40,976
Right. The meat looked plump.

2425
01:25:42,946 --> 01:25:46,515
(The extra thickness is another difference!)

2426
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:47,955
Should we get you three servings first?

2427
01:25:47,956 --> 01:25:49,015
Yes.

2428
01:25:49,016 --> 01:25:50,315
- We serve quite a lot, - We'll have that first.

2429
01:25:50,316 --> 01:25:52,486
- so start out with that.
- Right.

2430
01:25:52,626 --> 01:25:54,085
If that's not enough, we'll serve you two portions more.

2431
01:25:54,086 --> 01:25:55,095
- Right.
- Okay.

2432
01:25:55,096 --> 01:25:56,096
- That's what we'll do.
- Right.

2433
01:25:56,097 --> 01:25:57,995
It's the first time making such a simple order like this.

2434
01:25:57,996 --> 01:25:59,066
"That's what we'll get."

2435
01:26:00,196 --> 01:26:03,195
(The makchang that is grilled instead of getting boiled)

2436
01:26:03,196 --> 01:26:04,566
It's served like this.

2437
01:26:05,136 --> 01:26:06,166
I see.

2438
01:26:06,406 --> 01:26:08,106
- This is for three?
- Yes.

2439
01:26:08,606 --> 01:26:10,535
Just the meat on the grill seems like it's for four.

2440
01:26:10,536 --> 01:26:11,606
- Right.
- Aren't I right?

2441
01:26:12,406 --> 01:26:15,016
This seems to be around 6 to 7 portions.

2442
01:26:15,776 --> 01:26:17,615
Grill it as much as possible...

2443
01:26:17,616 --> 01:26:19,446
as this was slightly grilled in advance.

2444
01:26:19,486 --> 01:26:20,815
It has to be cooked thoroughly from front to back.

2445
01:26:20,816 --> 01:26:22,585
- Around this much?
- No.

2446
01:26:22,586 --> 01:26:24,115
- It has to turn slightly brown.
- It has to look...

2447
01:26:24,116 --> 01:26:25,825
Right. But it has to look even darker.

2448
01:26:25,826 --> 01:26:27,025
Right.

2449
01:26:27,026 --> 01:26:28,595
That makes the makchang taste better.

2450
01:26:28,596 --> 01:26:30,695
There are usually potatoes and other things served...

2451
01:26:30,696 --> 01:26:31,795
They will be served. Wait right here.

2452
01:26:31,796 --> 01:26:34,595
Nothing else should be placed before this gets cooked.

2453
01:26:34,596 --> 01:26:36,335
You should wait until we tell you to do so.

2454
01:26:36,336 --> 01:26:37,795
You will get in trouble the moment you place it.

2455
01:26:37,796 --> 01:26:38,935
We will make sure not to.

2456
01:26:38,936 --> 01:26:40,405
There's no grease on the grill.

2457
01:26:40,406 --> 01:26:42,052
When you put the potatoes on top when there's no grease,

2458
01:26:42,076 --> 01:26:43,505
she will come right away and say,

2459
01:26:43,506 --> 01:26:45,175
"I told you not to place them! Why place them?"

2460
01:26:45,176 --> 01:26:46,375
She will say this to you right away.

2461
01:26:46,376 --> 01:26:47,505
Since it has to taste good.

2462
01:26:47,506 --> 01:26:48,915
The scolding is a part of the price too.

2463
01:26:48,916 --> 01:26:50,415
I heard there were people who got hit too.

2464
01:26:50,416 --> 01:26:52,116
Right. A slap on the back.

2465
01:26:52,546 --> 01:26:53,546
Right.

2466
01:26:53,547 --> 01:26:55,085
(Seung Ho bravely attempts to grill the makchang.)

2467
01:26:55,086 --> 01:26:56,246
I'll leave it for a bit more.

2468
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:58,455
- Well...
- It takes quite a while.

2469
01:26:58,456 --> 01:27:00,425
- I'll teach you.
- She let out a sigh just now.

2470
01:27:00,426 --> 01:27:01,525
I almost got in trouble.

2471
01:27:01,526 --> 01:27:03,325
(The makchang is still undercooked and is white as snow.)

2472
01:27:03,326 --> 01:27:06,465
At first, the meat shouldn't be flipped around.

2473
01:27:06,466 --> 01:27:07,772
- Right.
- It's like that at first.

2474
01:27:07,796 --> 01:27:08,866
Right.

2475
01:27:08,996 --> 01:27:10,095
Look. It's getting cooked now.

2476
01:27:10,096 --> 01:27:11,235
- Right.
- Like this.

2477
01:27:11,236 --> 01:27:12,305
It has to be cooked like this.

2478
01:27:12,306 --> 01:27:14,005
It has to be like this from front to back.

2479
01:27:14,006 --> 01:27:16,075
Should I flip the ones in the middle now?

2480
01:27:16,076 --> 01:27:17,135
- Yes.
- Is that okay?

2481
01:27:17,136 --> 01:27:18,405
Okay.

2482
01:27:18,406 --> 01:27:19,675
- It's not cooked yet.
- It's not cooked yet.

2483
01:27:19,676 --> 01:27:20,905
- It's not ready yet.
- Right.

2484
01:27:20,906 --> 01:27:22,826
- It's not ready yet.
- Just grill it like that.

2485
01:27:23,216 --> 01:27:24,476
It needs more time.

2486
01:27:24,786 --> 01:27:25,985
Based on my experience,

2487
01:27:25,986 --> 01:27:27,416
she's really holding it in.

2488
01:27:27,846 --> 01:27:30,086
Seung Ho almost got hit just now.

2489
01:27:30,286 --> 01:27:31,625
- Right.
- You almost got in trouble.

2490
01:27:31,626 --> 01:27:33,356
(Let's do well.)

2491
01:27:34,456 --> 01:27:35,895
(It's important to use the grill well.)

2492
01:27:35,896 --> 01:27:37,526
(Salt-grilled makchang)

2493
01:27:38,296 --> 01:27:39,695
The scent of the makchang...

2494
01:27:39,696 --> 01:27:42,096
smells 2 to 3 times stronger than ones served elsewhere.

2495
01:27:42,536 --> 01:27:44,235
This savory smell...

2496
01:27:44,236 --> 01:27:45,806
feels appetizing.

2497
01:27:46,206 --> 01:27:48,406
A rich scent can be felt right away.

2498
01:27:49,606 --> 01:27:51,905
(The white makchang pieces...)

2499
01:27:51,906 --> 01:27:54,776
(have started to turn gold.)

2500
01:27:57,776 --> 01:28:01,786
(Seung Ho carefully takes a bite.)

2501
01:28:03,886 --> 01:28:05,226
(It's hot.)

2502
01:28:05,786 --> 01:28:07,455
(Curious)

2503
01:28:07,456 --> 01:28:09,126
- Just like that.
- My gosh!

2504
01:28:09,296 --> 01:28:11,125
I just ate a piece that was cooked to perfection.

2505
01:28:11,126 --> 01:28:12,166
How is it?

2506
01:28:12,566 --> 01:28:15,135
The outside crumbles with its crispiness...

2507
01:28:15,136 --> 01:28:16,196
and it's so soft inside.

2508
01:28:17,396 --> 01:28:21,536
(A harmony with the crispy outside and the bouncy inside)

2509
01:28:22,376 --> 01:28:25,345
(This is fresh makchang.)

2510
01:28:25,346 --> 01:28:27,546
It was the first time you expressed the food like that.

2511
01:28:28,216 --> 01:28:30,316
(Loving it)

2512
01:28:30,776 --> 01:28:32,385
Pani Bottle eats it with his own style.

2513
01:28:32,386 --> 01:28:35,686
(Pani has it with the sesame leaf and other vegetables.)

2514
01:28:35,856 --> 01:28:37,316
It has to be cooked well.

2515
01:28:37,456 --> 01:28:39,155
It's hard to cook makchang.

2516
01:28:39,156 --> 01:28:41,225
It gets cooked as the grease seeps out.

2517
01:28:41,226 --> 01:28:43,796
(It makes you hum the more you taste it.)

2518
01:28:44,196 --> 01:28:46,196
(Sang Uk dips it in the sauce.)

2519
01:28:47,226 --> 01:28:48,595
Just give it a try first.

2520
01:28:48,596 --> 01:28:50,635
- Gosh, the sauce smells great.
- Then eat it with the sesame leaf.

2521
01:28:50,636 --> 01:28:51,935
Sang Uk's first bite.

2522
01:28:51,936 --> 01:28:53,405
(He pops it into his mouth without hesitation.)

2523
01:28:53,406 --> 01:28:55,405
You have to be careful as it's really hot.

2524
01:28:55,406 --> 01:28:56,736
(Nodding)

2525
01:28:56,936 --> 01:28:58,045
How is it, Sang Uk?

2526
01:28:58,046 --> 01:28:59,145
(How does it taste?)

2527
01:28:59,146 --> 01:29:00,345
(Amazed)

2528
01:29:00,346 --> 01:29:01,746
- Gosh.
- This one is fully cooked.

2529
01:29:02,516 --> 01:29:03,976
The makchang is good itself.

2530
01:29:04,346 --> 01:29:06,222
- The sauce is good too?
- I thought this was just chojang.

2531
01:29:06,246 --> 01:29:07,686
- Right.
- The sauce is amazing.

2532
01:29:09,086 --> 01:29:11,255
(Let's try smelling it.)

2533
01:29:11,256 --> 01:29:13,986
It's like it's in between gochujang and chojang.

2534
01:29:16,026 --> 01:29:17,925
(The special sauce adds sweetness and spiciness...)

2535
01:29:17,926 --> 01:29:19,825
(to the savory makchang.)

2536
01:29:19,826 --> 01:29:22,096
It can be eaten when the inside feels soft.

2537
01:29:22,296 --> 01:29:24,436
It can also be eaten after grilling it even more.

2538
01:29:26,136 --> 01:29:27,905
(The fresh makchang presents different textures...)

2539
01:29:27,906 --> 01:29:29,576
(based on how much it's grilled.)

2540
01:29:34,146 --> 01:29:36,446
(It can be eaten as a wrap, )

2541
01:29:40,046 --> 01:29:42,516
(eaten after a good blow, )

2542
01:29:43,386 --> 01:29:45,586
(eaten with seriousness, )

2543
01:29:48,026 --> 01:29:50,626
(eaten with the sauce, )

2544
01:29:51,156 --> 01:29:52,366
(Nodding)

2545
01:29:53,026 --> 01:29:55,136
(and eaten to fill in the whole mouth.)

2546
01:29:57,496 --> 01:29:58,536
Dong Hyun.

2547
01:29:59,466 --> 01:30:00,566
It's the onion wrap.

2548
01:30:00,936 --> 01:30:03,705
(It can also be eaten while making fun of others.)

2549
01:30:03,706 --> 01:30:05,176
Gosh, I shouldn't have looked.

2550
01:30:05,906 --> 01:30:08,006
I can't imagine how different it could be.

2551
01:30:08,076 --> 01:30:09,216
I'm curious right now.

2552
01:30:09,276 --> 01:30:11,485
(Glaring)

2553
01:30:11,486 --> 01:30:13,216
Seung Ho looks healthy with his complexion.

2554
01:30:13,386 --> 01:30:16,316
I fell in love after trying Daegu's makchang.

2555
01:30:16,686 --> 01:30:19,025
I went to many different places in Seoul in search for it...

2556
01:30:19,026 --> 01:30:20,255
as it was so good.

2557
01:30:20,256 --> 01:30:22,326
This place beats all of the other places.

2558
01:30:22,826 --> 01:30:23,826
Right.

2559
01:30:25,196 --> 01:30:28,766
(A taste that summons Daegu in Gongneung-dong)

2560
01:30:30,566 --> 01:30:31,905
(Pani places something on the grill.)

2561
01:30:31,906 --> 01:30:33,935
Now that the grease is out...

2562
01:30:33,936 --> 01:30:36,336
Is it okay to place the garlic? Will you not get in trouble?

2563
01:30:36,506 --> 01:30:38,106
- I'm checking on her right now.
- Aunt!

2564
01:30:38,476 --> 01:30:39,546
Don't tell me off.

2565
01:30:40,106 --> 01:30:41,745
- It wasn't placed yet.
- Right.

2566
01:30:41,746 --> 01:30:43,215
Can the garlic be placed now?

2567
01:30:43,216 --> 01:30:44,676
- I should teach you.
- Right.

2568
01:30:44,746 --> 01:30:46,415
I placed the garlic on top as there was some grease.

2569
01:30:46,416 --> 01:30:48,355
It can't be placed right away.

2570
01:30:48,356 --> 01:30:49,556
Who placed this?

2571
01:30:51,486 --> 01:30:52,785
- Pani did it.
- It was him.

2572
01:30:52,786 --> 01:30:53,786
You should scold him.

2573
01:30:53,787 --> 01:30:55,456
(Aunt...)

2574
01:30:56,126 --> 01:30:58,725
Well, this wasn't so bad.

2575
01:30:58,726 --> 01:31:00,365
This wasn't so bad.

2576
01:31:00,366 --> 01:31:01,495
Really? That's a relief.

2577
01:31:01,496 --> 01:31:02,965
(Relieved)

2578
01:31:02,966 --> 01:31:03,996
What a relief.

2579
01:31:04,806 --> 01:31:06,865
The garlic has to go to the side now, right?

2580
01:31:06,866 --> 01:31:08,626
- To where there's a lot of grease.
- Right.

2581
01:31:09,136 --> 01:31:11,946
(The garlic gets grilled nicely on the side...)

2582
01:31:12,376 --> 01:31:16,045
(and the potatoes get grilled to a crisp with the grease.)

2583
01:31:16,046 --> 01:31:17,946
We all got a piece of the potato.

2584
01:31:18,346 --> 01:31:19,585
- The potatoes.
- The potatoes taste really good.

2585
01:31:19,586 --> 01:31:21,756
They're just like potato chips.

2586
01:31:21,916 --> 01:31:23,055
Right.

2587
01:31:23,056 --> 01:31:24,456
(It looks just like a potato chip.)

2588
01:31:24,956 --> 01:31:27,426
(He takes a bite right away...)

2589
01:31:29,256 --> 01:31:31,496
(and feels amazed.)

2590
01:31:32,026 --> 01:31:34,966
(Sang Uk takes a bite after dipping it in the sauce.)

2591
01:31:36,866 --> 01:31:38,806
(This is...)

2592
01:31:39,206 --> 01:31:40,235
(Amazed)

2593
01:31:40,236 --> 01:31:41,935
- What is it?
- It's like it's fried.

2594
01:31:41,936 --> 01:31:43,505
It's like a thick potato chip,

2595
01:31:43,506 --> 01:31:45,646
but the inside feels really fluffy.

2596
01:31:46,606 --> 01:31:49,116
The outside has sort of a crust as it was fried.

2597
01:31:49,216 --> 01:31:50,676
(Touched)

2598
01:31:50,946 --> 01:31:52,915
(The perfect example...)

2599
01:31:52,916 --> 01:31:54,686
(of crispy outside and fluffy inside)

2600
01:31:55,856 --> 01:31:56,885
I wish I couldn't see anything...

2601
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:58,086
with the place full of steam.

2602
01:31:58,456 --> 01:32:00,355
It smells so nice.

2603
01:32:00,356 --> 01:32:01,356
(Jealous)

2604
01:32:01,526 --> 01:32:03,925
(Going blank)

2605
01:32:03,926 --> 01:32:06,896
I think Pani should...

2606
01:32:07,326 --> 01:32:09,195
give out a quiz at this point.

2607
01:32:09,196 --> 01:32:10,965
- Please hurry.
- We've tried it.

2608
01:32:10,966 --> 01:32:12,235
I kept listening to it...

2609
01:32:12,236 --> 01:32:14,106
and it reminded me of the sound of rain.

2610
01:32:14,406 --> 01:32:15,475
I think the wrap...

2611
01:32:15,476 --> 01:32:16,875
should have two pieces of meat.

2612
01:32:16,876 --> 01:32:18,846
It will have the garlic and sauce too.

2613
01:32:19,446 --> 01:32:21,406
- That's great.
- I can get the answer.

2614
01:32:21,576 --> 01:32:23,175
- Let's go for it.
- Tae Hyun wants to win too.

2615
01:32:23,176 --> 01:32:24,215
- I will...
- Let's go for it.

2616
01:32:24,216 --> 01:32:26,915
- Pani Bottle's World Trivia!
- Trivia!

2617
01:32:26,916 --> 01:32:28,385
(Pani Bottle's World Trivia)

2618
01:32:28,386 --> 01:32:31,386
- This is based on my experience.
- Right.

2619
01:32:31,726 --> 01:32:34,156
I've experienced a festival called the Lathmar Holi...

2620
01:32:34,356 --> 01:32:37,526
- in a place in India.
- Right.

2621
01:32:38,026 --> 01:32:39,525
In this festival,

2622
01:32:39,526 --> 01:32:43,736
the women do something to the men.

2623
01:32:44,366 --> 01:32:45,735
What could that be?

2624
01:32:45,736 --> 01:32:46,765
The women do something to the men in this festival?

2625
01:32:46,766 --> 01:32:47,805
Right.

2626
01:32:47,806 --> 01:32:48,905
- I got it.
- Yes?

2627
01:32:48,906 --> 01:32:50,105
The women slap the men.

2628
01:32:50,106 --> 01:32:51,375
- Incorrect.
- Gosh.

2629
01:32:51,376 --> 01:32:52,446
But...

2630
01:32:52,976 --> 01:32:54,376
- it was pretty close.
- What?

2631
01:32:54,916 --> 01:32:56,775
It was pretty close. It will be answered too quickly.

2632
01:32:56,776 --> 01:32:58,546
- It's along those lines.
- Right.

2633
01:32:58,786 --> 01:33:00,416
The women do this to the men?

2634
01:33:01,186 --> 01:33:02,755
I got it. They curse and hit the men.

2635
01:33:02,756 --> 01:33:03,956
Incorrect.

2636
01:33:04,186 --> 01:33:05,225
It's about hitting the men, right?

2637
01:33:05,226 --> 01:33:06,832
The women hit the men with a blunt weapon.

2638
01:33:06,856 --> 01:33:08,225
How is that possible?

2639
01:33:08,226 --> 01:33:09,456
Hold on. That's...

2640
01:33:09,956 --> 01:33:12,065
- Why hesitate for that?
- A blunt weapon?

2641
01:33:12,066 --> 01:33:13,095
A blunt weapon could be something like a bat.

2642
01:33:13,096 --> 01:33:14,125
You have to decide on the weapon.

2643
01:33:14,126 --> 01:33:15,965
- There are so many blunt weapons.
- Gosh.

2644
01:33:15,966 --> 01:33:17,396
Incorrect. But...

2645
01:33:17,536 --> 01:33:18,936
there was a reason why I hesitated.

2646
01:33:18,966 --> 01:33:20,065
That was almost the answer.

2647
01:33:20,066 --> 01:33:21,706
- But...
- I got it.

2648
01:33:21,976 --> 01:33:23,735
- Women hit men with a hammer.
- I got it.

2649
01:33:23,736 --> 01:33:24,835
Incorrect.

2650
01:33:24,836 --> 01:33:26,206
- A bat.
- Incorrect.

2651
01:33:26,806 --> 01:33:28,616
- I got it. A whip.
- Incorrect.

2652
01:33:28,946 --> 01:33:30,775
I got it. The women hit the men with a stick.

2653
01:33:30,776 --> 01:33:31,846
Correct.

2654
01:33:32,516 --> 01:33:34,215
It's either a cane or stick.

2655
01:33:34,216 --> 01:33:35,716
That was why I...

2656
01:33:36,456 --> 01:33:37,732
It was hard to give it for that.

2657
01:33:37,756 --> 01:33:39,525
Calling it a blunt weapon must've been slightly off.

2658
01:33:39,526 --> 01:33:40,625
Right. It was slightly off.

2659
01:33:40,626 --> 01:33:41,795
It wasn't a blunt weapon.

2660
01:33:41,796 --> 01:33:44,025
I went and the women there carried around sticks...

2661
01:33:44,026 --> 01:33:45,795
and hit the men walking by.

2662
01:33:45,796 --> 01:33:46,995
- Why?
- I'll explain why.

2663
01:33:46,996 --> 01:33:48,995
The northern part of India is religious...

2664
01:33:48,996 --> 01:33:51,235
and it's still very patriarchal there.

2665
01:33:51,236 --> 01:33:53,506
During the festival,

2666
01:33:53,866 --> 01:33:57,075
the women are given a chance to be higher up than the men.

2667
01:33:57,076 --> 01:33:58,175
(Lathmar Holi)

2668
01:33:58,176 --> 01:34:00,656
(There's a tradition where the women hit the men with sticks.)

2669
01:34:00,976 --> 01:34:02,776
It becomes really addicting.

2670
01:34:02,916 --> 01:34:05,046
- The texture feels so nice.
- Right.

2671
01:34:05,246 --> 01:34:06,246
Why does he get two pieces?

2672
01:34:06,247 --> 01:34:07,445
- He should get 1.
- I was told it was 2.

2673
01:34:07,446 --> 01:34:09,286
Dong Hyun, you can get two, but...

2674
01:34:10,516 --> 01:34:11,616
Put it inside.

2675
01:34:11,926 --> 01:34:13,225
Why did you get three?

2676
01:34:13,226 --> 01:34:14,826
- I got three? I didn't know.
- Come on!

2677
01:34:14,926 --> 01:34:16,355
- I didn't know.
- Gosh.

2678
01:34:16,356 --> 01:34:17,525
I couldn't help myself.

2679
01:34:17,526 --> 01:34:19,626
- You can add in a piece of garlic.
- Come on!

2680
01:34:20,026 --> 01:34:21,896
I see. You all were watching.

2681
01:34:21,966 --> 01:34:22,996
Gosh.

2682
01:34:23,696 --> 01:34:24,735
(Laughing)

2683
01:34:24,736 --> 01:34:26,435
What's unique about the sauce is that...

2684
01:34:26,436 --> 01:34:28,916
it doesn't feel salty or strong even when you eat a lot of it.

2685
01:34:30,036 --> 01:34:31,336
The potatoes are amazing.

2686
01:34:31,806 --> 01:34:33,845
(Cicada Kim's signature move, eating while teasing)

2687
01:34:33,846 --> 01:34:35,016
The potatoes are amazing.

2688
01:34:35,846 --> 01:34:37,745
We ate all of the potatoes.

2689
01:34:37,746 --> 01:34:39,485
- Gosh.
- They're really good.

2690
01:34:39,486 --> 01:34:40,885
- How is it?
- There are people like that.

2691
01:34:40,886 --> 01:34:42,056
It's so savory!

2692
01:34:42,156 --> 01:34:43,185
It's so crispy.

2693
01:34:43,186 --> 01:34:44,755
How is it so savory?

2694
01:34:44,756 --> 01:34:45,825
- Gosh.
- The sauce is so good.

2695
01:34:45,826 --> 01:34:47,225
It works so well with the scent...

2696
01:34:47,226 --> 01:34:48,725
of the garlic, onion, and perilla leaf.

2697
01:34:48,726 --> 01:34:50,556
(Greatly satisfied)

2698
01:34:51,926 --> 01:34:53,165
(Enough to be the only dish on the menu, salt-grilled makchang)

2699
01:34:53,166 --> 01:34:55,236
Ma'am, could we get the bill?

2700
01:34:55,696 --> 01:34:57,195
Five portions is just...

2701
01:34:57,196 --> 01:34:58,605
Five portions...

2702
01:34:58,606 --> 01:34:59,635
- should be 90 dollars.
- Right?

2703
01:34:59,636 --> 01:35:01,366
It's 106 dollars including the Coke.

2704
01:35:02,076 --> 01:35:03,306
It's so neat. Gosh.

2705
01:35:03,836 --> 01:35:04,935
Let's go for it now.

2706
01:35:04,936 --> 01:35:06,045
Would you like the quiz?

2707
01:35:06,046 --> 01:35:07,126
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

2708
01:35:07,176 --> 01:35:10,646
Grilled makchang is a representative dish in Daegu...

2709
01:35:10,746 --> 01:35:13,616
that is included in the top ten tastes of Daegu.

2710
01:35:13,946 --> 01:35:15,516
Then out of the following answers,

2711
01:35:15,986 --> 01:35:20,655
which dish is not included in this year's...

2712
01:35:20,656 --> 01:35:22,725
top ten tastes of Daegu?

2713
01:35:22,726 --> 01:35:24,225
This won't be too hard.

2714
01:35:24,226 --> 01:35:25,325
It's so easy.

2715
01:35:25,326 --> 01:35:26,696
One, mungtigi.

2716
01:35:27,266 --> 01:35:29,166
Two, yaki udon.

2717
01:35:29,366 --> 01:35:31,036
Three, fried chicken.

2718
01:35:31,196 --> 01:35:33,066
Four, ttaro-gukbap.

2719
01:35:34,136 --> 01:35:35,335
It's the top ten tastes...

2720
01:35:35,336 --> 01:35:36,952
and would the mungtigi not be a part of it?

2721
01:35:36,976 --> 01:35:38,675
- Right. It has to be on the list.
- It must've been eaten too much.

2722
01:35:38,676 --> 01:35:41,246
Mungtigi is something that is as famous as the makchang.

2723
01:35:41,376 --> 01:35:43,046
I feel like the mungtigi is on the list.

2724
01:35:43,516 --> 01:35:45,115
The mungtigi should be exempted.

2725
01:35:45,116 --> 01:35:46,396
The mungtigi should be exempted.

2726
01:35:46,846 --> 01:35:47,985
Why is the fried chicken there?

2727
01:35:47,986 --> 01:35:49,116
This is hard.

2728
01:35:49,256 --> 01:35:50,886
Daegu has its fried chicken festival.

2729
01:35:51,656 --> 01:35:52,756
- I see.
- Right.

2730
01:35:53,226 --> 01:35:54,826
Does Daegu have a mungtigi festival?

2731
01:35:55,026 --> 01:35:56,125
Why is the yaki udon there?

2732
01:35:56,126 --> 01:35:58,095
- The yaki udon is from Japan.
- Why is it there?

2733
01:35:58,096 --> 01:35:59,266
Why is it there?

2734
01:35:59,326 --> 01:36:00,965
It's obvious that it's a Japanese dish.

2735
01:36:00,966 --> 01:36:02,035
(It's obvious that it's a Japanese dish.)

2736
01:36:02,036 --> 01:36:03,996
It's the dish that stands out so much on its own.

2737
01:36:04,066 --> 01:36:05,605
I feel like it's a trap...

2738
01:36:05,606 --> 01:36:07,565
- to get us confused.
- It's a trap.

2739
01:36:07,566 --> 01:36:08,806
It's a trap.

2740
01:36:08,906 --> 01:36:11,136
I know quite a lot about the ttaro-gukbap...

2741
01:36:11,176 --> 01:36:12,675
because Kwaktube, a close friend of mine,

2742
01:36:12,676 --> 01:36:14,306
talked about the ttaro-gukbap often.

2743
01:36:14,406 --> 01:36:15,815
- We...
- Busan?

2744
01:36:15,816 --> 01:36:17,075
- Since he's from Busan?
- Right.

2745
01:36:17,076 --> 01:36:19,146
I feel like the ttaro-gukbap...

2746
01:36:19,916 --> 01:36:21,955
is a dish considered local to Busan.

2747
01:36:21,956 --> 01:36:23,685
I lived in Busan...

2748
01:36:23,686 --> 01:36:25,262
and the ttaro-gukbap wasn't famous in Busan.

2749
01:36:25,286 --> 01:36:26,756
The pork gukbap is famous in Busan.

2750
01:36:27,626 --> 01:36:28,895
Could the yaki udon be...

2751
01:36:28,896 --> 01:36:30,626
the answer that feels like a trap?

2752
01:36:31,426 --> 01:36:33,225
To be honest, I think it's either the yaki udon...

2753
01:36:33,226 --> 01:36:34,896
or ttaro-gukbap.

2754
01:36:35,736 --> 01:36:37,136
Should we go with your answer?

2755
01:36:37,696 --> 01:36:39,565
- Then...
- What would it be?

2756
01:36:39,566 --> 01:36:40,835
I'll go with the ttaro-gukbap.

2757
01:36:40,836 --> 01:36:42,435
- The ttaro-gukbap?
- Yes.

2758
01:36:42,436 --> 01:36:45,116
The dish that isn't part of the top ten tastes is the ttaro-gukbap.

2759
01:36:45,646 --> 01:36:47,975
The dish that isn't part of the top ten tastes is the ttaro-gukbap?

2760
01:36:47,976 --> 01:36:49,345
(Ttaro-gukbap)

2761
01:36:49,346 --> 01:36:50,516
Incorrect.

2762
01:36:51,516 --> 01:36:53,515
- That means...
- Gosh.

2763
01:36:53,516 --> 01:36:55,115
- If Seung Ho loses...
- It might happen.

2764
01:36:55,116 --> 01:36:56,116
I got it.

2765
01:36:56,286 --> 01:36:57,415
- Hold on.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

2766
01:36:57,416 --> 01:36:59,855
- Rock-paper-scissors to choose.
- There are three answers left.

2767
01:36:59,856 --> 01:37:01,302
The winner will be able to choose one first.

2768
01:37:01,326 --> 01:37:03,446
- There are three answers left.
- The winner chooses.

2769
01:37:03,526 --> 01:37:05,026
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

2770
01:37:05,326 --> 01:37:07,395
- Done.
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

2771
01:37:07,396 --> 01:37:08,895
(Seung Ho goes last, Pani goes 2nd, and Sang Uk goes 1st.)

2772
01:37:08,896 --> 01:37:09,896
It's over.

2773
01:37:09,897 --> 01:37:11,066
I'll go with the yaki udon.

2774
01:37:11,596 --> 01:37:12,765
If it's between the mungtigi and fried chicken,

2775
01:37:12,766 --> 01:37:14,665
- I think it'll be fried chicken.
- The fried chicken?

2776
01:37:14,666 --> 01:37:16,982
- He has to go with the mungtigi.
- Seung Ho gets the mungtigi.

2777
01:37:17,006 --> 01:37:18,375
- I chose the fried chicken.
- All right.

2778
01:37:18,376 --> 01:37:19,475
The fried chicken...

2779
01:37:19,476 --> 01:37:21,075
(Pani will pay and put on makeup if he gets it wrong!)

2780
01:37:21,076 --> 01:37:22,345
is not...

2781
01:37:22,346 --> 01:37:23,445
part of the top ten tastes.

2782
01:37:23,446 --> 01:37:24,945
(Fried chicken)

2783
01:37:24,946 --> 01:37:25,946
What happens then?

2784
01:37:25,947 --> 01:37:27,145
It's these two left.

2785
01:37:27,146 --> 01:37:28,585
(Seung Ho and Sang Uk advance to the final round.)

2786
01:37:28,586 --> 01:37:29,815
You still have a chance.

2787
01:37:29,816 --> 01:37:31,016
Really?

2788
01:37:31,416 --> 01:37:32,626
I still have a chance.

2789
01:37:33,086 --> 01:37:34,485
- You did it.
- I still have a chance.

2790
01:37:34,486 --> 01:37:35,495
- I still have a chance.
- It was fried chicken?

2791
01:37:35,496 --> 01:37:37,172
- It was fried chicken?
- It was fried chicken?

2792
01:37:37,196 --> 01:37:40,025
In the top ten tastes of Daegu announced by Daegu,

2793
01:37:40,026 --> 01:37:41,495
(Top 10 tastes of Daegu)

2794
01:37:41,496 --> 01:37:42,665
(Ttaro-gukbap, Dongin-dong braised short ribs, grilled makchang, )

2795
01:37:42,666 --> 01:37:43,795
(Catfish stew, raw fish salad, flat dumplings, puffer bulgogi, )

2796
01:37:43,796 --> 01:37:45,065
(yaki udon, mungtigi, nurung noodles)

2797
01:37:45,066 --> 01:37:48,305
The yaki udon was made in Daegu in the 70s...

2798
01:37:48,306 --> 01:37:50,235
by an overseas Chinese chef...

2799
01:37:50,236 --> 01:37:52,106
and is considered a fully Korean dish.

2800
01:37:52,776 --> 01:37:54,475
It wasn't a Japanese dish. What a surprise.

2801
01:37:54,476 --> 01:37:55,916
(It's a Korean-style Chinese dish.)

2802
01:37:56,876 --> 01:37:58,685
If Seung Ho loses in the final,

2803
01:37:58,686 --> 01:38:00,015
the score will be 2 to 2.

2804
01:38:00,016 --> 01:38:01,345
Then another round has to be done.

2805
01:38:01,346 --> 01:38:03,816
There must be a way to decide on the loser.

2806
01:38:04,556 --> 01:38:07,156
- Please give us the final quiz.
- Please give us the final quiz.

2807
01:38:07,226 --> 01:38:10,325
Regularly, the pig's tail is known to be straight.

2808
01:38:10,326 --> 01:38:11,796
- I see.
- It's straight?

2809
01:38:12,766 --> 01:38:15,335
It is said that the pig's tail curls up...

2810
01:38:15,336 --> 01:38:17,065
based on a specific mental state of the pig.

2811
01:38:17,066 --> 01:38:19,465
- Really?
- What could it be?

2812
01:38:19,466 --> 01:38:21,205
Why did we always see the tail curled up?

2813
01:38:21,206 --> 01:38:22,835
- It's even drawn like that.
- It's usually like this.

2814
01:38:22,836 --> 01:38:23,906
It's even drawn like that.

2815
01:38:24,476 --> 01:38:26,276
- A specific mental state?
- Yes.

2816
01:38:27,076 --> 01:38:28,246
I got it.

2817
01:38:28,876 --> 01:38:30,216
When the pig wants to excrete.

2818
01:38:31,146 --> 01:38:33,216
(Could that be the answer?)

2819
01:38:33,986 --> 01:38:35,586
When the pig wants to excrete?

2820
01:38:36,056 --> 01:38:37,086
Incorrect.

2821
01:38:37,316 --> 01:38:38,886
It's a mental state.

2822
01:38:39,326 --> 01:38:40,386
I got it.

2823
01:38:40,586 --> 01:38:41,626
When it's hungry.

2824
01:38:41,686 --> 01:38:42,795
When it is feeling hungry?

2825
01:38:42,796 --> 01:38:45,055
(Answer: When it's hungry)

2826
01:38:45,056 --> 01:38:46,426
- Incorrect.
- I got it.

2827
01:38:47,296 --> 01:38:49,296
- When it's sleepy.
- When it's sleepy?

2828
01:38:50,036 --> 01:38:51,395
- Incorrect.
- I got it.

2829
01:38:51,396 --> 01:38:53,035
When it gets up from its sleep.

2830
01:38:53,036 --> 01:38:54,535
When it wakes up?

2831
01:38:54,536 --> 01:38:55,675
- Incorrect.
- I got it.

2832
01:38:55,676 --> 01:38:57,175
- When it's scared.
- Correct.

2833
01:38:57,176 --> 01:39:00,075
(Answer: When it's scared)

2834
01:39:00,076 --> 01:39:01,076
Correct

2835
01:39:01,077 --> 01:39:04,175
(A bolt...)

2836
01:39:04,176 --> 01:39:06,945
(from the blue)

2837
01:39:06,946 --> 01:39:08,345
When it's scared?

2838
01:39:08,346 --> 01:39:09,516
Oh Sang Uk will pay...

2839
01:39:09,656 --> 01:39:12,025
and Pani Bottle will put on the makeup!

2840
01:39:12,026 --> 01:39:13,755
(Oh Sang Uk will pay and Pani Bottle will put on the makeup.)

2841
01:39:13,756 --> 01:39:15,076
It does that when it gets scared?

2842
01:39:16,056 --> 01:39:17,725
I have to put on makeup after coming all the way here?

2843
01:39:17,726 --> 01:39:19,666
(Losing it)

2844
01:39:20,326 --> 01:39:21,795
Get the pen. Where did it go?

2845
01:39:21,796 --> 01:39:22,835
I'm sorry.

2846
01:39:22,836 --> 01:39:25,036
- Let's go with the snot.
- It's okay.

2847
01:39:26,936 --> 01:39:28,265
(He takes off his glasses quietly.)

2848
01:39:28,266 --> 01:39:29,706
Let's see.

2849
01:39:30,976 --> 01:39:32,736
Is that really made with makeup ingredients?

2850
01:39:33,246 --> 01:39:35,106
You said today was the start of this, right?

2851
01:39:35,316 --> 01:39:36,445
This was never done before today.

2852
01:39:36,446 --> 01:39:37,846
- I made the start.
- I see.

2853
01:39:38,216 --> 01:39:40,786
I'll do it like this.

2854
01:39:40,916 --> 01:39:41,945
It's a mic.

2855
01:39:41,946 --> 01:39:43,015
(Pani's new look...)

2856
01:39:43,016 --> 01:39:44,685
(is coming together.)

2857
01:39:44,686 --> 01:39:45,686
Add some hearts.

2858
01:39:45,687 --> 01:39:46,826
But he looks great.

2859
01:39:47,886 --> 01:39:48,995
Don't be like that.

2860
01:39:48,996 --> 01:39:50,496
(Feeling happy)

2861
01:39:51,156 --> 01:39:53,326
(Satisfied)

2862
01:39:53,466 --> 01:39:54,626
That's cute.

2863
01:39:54,796 --> 01:39:56,235
- That's cute.
- Right.

2864
01:39:56,236 --> 01:39:57,365
(How will Pani look?)

2865
01:39:57,366 --> 01:39:59,536
We came to Gongneung-dong,

2866
01:39:59,766 --> 01:40:02,805
a place full of Pani Bottle's youth.

2867
01:40:02,806 --> 01:40:04,605
We were able to come to Pani Bottle's favorite restaurant...

2868
01:40:04,606 --> 01:40:06,545
- thanks to him.
- Right.

2869
01:40:06,546 --> 01:40:09,716
We spent some time together here in Gongneung.

2870
01:40:09,816 --> 01:40:11,392
I'm curious about your thoughts of today.

2871
01:40:11,416 --> 01:40:13,185
Well, to be honest,

2872
01:40:13,186 --> 01:40:15,855
I thought I was here just to eat some food.

2873
01:40:15,856 --> 01:40:18,156
But was good enough to call it a Pani Bottle Special...

2874
01:40:18,186 --> 01:40:20,386
and I loved that I was able to come back to this place.

2875
01:40:20,586 --> 01:40:23,056
I wasn't in variety shows for a long time,

2876
01:40:23,196 --> 01:40:25,636
but all of your reactions were so good after trying the food.

2877
01:40:26,166 --> 01:40:27,595
I was able to realize...

2878
01:40:27,596 --> 01:40:29,135
that I wasn't the only one who enjoys the food here.

2879
01:40:29,136 --> 01:40:30,335
That part was great too.

2880
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:31,365
(Laughing)

2881
01:40:31,366 --> 01:40:33,065
I was told that your mic came off.

2882
01:40:33,066 --> 01:40:34,365
I'm sorry.

2883
01:40:34,366 --> 01:40:35,405
One, two, three. You can hear me now, right?

2884
01:40:35,406 --> 01:40:36,406
- Yes.
- Okay.

2885
01:40:36,407 --> 01:40:37,506
Could you sniff for us?

2886
01:40:39,576 --> 01:40:40,646
Like this.

2887
01:40:41,346 --> 01:40:43,676
I had a great time!

2888
01:40:43,976 --> 01:40:45,745
Thank you so much.

2889
01:40:45,746 --> 01:40:48,245

2890
01:40:48,246 --> 01:40:49,385
Thank you, Sang Uk.

2891
01:40:49,386 --> 01:40:51,316
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

2892
01:40:51,986 --> 01:40:53,456
It was really good.

2893
01:40:53,556 --> 01:40:55,226
- Really?
- Yes.

2894
01:40:55,496 --> 01:40:56,595
Gosh.

2895
01:40:56,596 --> 01:40:58,656
- I'll make sure to visit again.
- Sure.

2896
01:40:59,366 --> 01:41:00,496
