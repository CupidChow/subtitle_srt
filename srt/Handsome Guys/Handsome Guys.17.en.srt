1
00:00:15,126 --> 00:00:17,095
(Our deep condolences to those...)

2
00:00:17,096 --> 00:00:18,925
(who suffered from the wildfire disaster.)

3
00:00:18,926 --> 00:00:20,736
(We hope that your everyday life will be recovered soon.)

4
00:00:22,296 --> 00:00:26,106
(The last cold snap at its peak on a day in March)

5
00:00:26,536 --> 00:00:29,106
(Handsome Guys in Bonghwa)

6
00:00:29,246 --> 00:00:31,976
(What will be the Handsome story today?)

7
00:00:32,276 --> 00:00:33,276
Hello.

8
00:00:33,277 --> 00:00:34,445
- Hello. - Hello.

9
00:00:34,446 --> 00:00:36,946
(They come to work through the heavy snow.)

10
00:00:37,186 --> 00:00:39,316
What? It stopped snowing like it never snowed.

11
00:00:39,616 --> 00:00:41,955
- Are we going back in time? - What's this?

12
00:00:41,956 --> 00:00:43,786
It will be hot when this episode gets aired.

13
00:00:44,126 --> 00:00:46,495
- There will be cherry blossoms. - What's going on here?

14
00:00:46,496 --> 00:00:47,526
- Seriously... - Today...

15
00:00:48,056 --> 00:00:49,766
I left home early in the morning.

16
00:00:49,866 --> 00:00:50,996
When I looked at the map,

17
00:00:51,296 --> 00:00:53,166
I saw the heavy snow warning.

18
00:00:53,236 --> 00:00:55,166
There was a special weather report only at today's location.

19
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,335
A special weather report?

20
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:57,666
- It's only snowing here. - Exactly.

21
00:00:57,836 --> 00:00:59,035
I was shocked.

22
00:00:59,036 --> 00:01:00,735
When I got here, they told me to go back.

23
00:01:00,736 --> 00:01:02,135
- They told me that it was closed. - Really?

24
00:01:02,136 --> 00:01:03,206
They said that I couldn't come up here.

25
00:01:03,876 --> 00:01:05,376
Sang Uk, you lost a lot of weight.

26
00:01:05,676 --> 00:01:06,975
- Sang Uk... - I'm having a hard time.

27
00:01:06,976 --> 00:01:08,075
You've been practising...

28
00:01:08,076 --> 00:01:10,085
- too much fencing. - His height is similar.

29
00:01:10,086 --> 00:01:11,645
You look whiter than before.

30
00:01:11,646 --> 00:01:14,055
You're acting like you've been here all along.

31
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:15,155
Tell us why...

32
00:01:15,156 --> 00:01:16,685
- Sang Uk is missing today. - These days...

33
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:18,056
That's not what I meant.

34
00:01:18,656 --> 00:01:19,796
What's going on these days?

35
00:01:19,896 --> 00:01:22,525
He's back to competing in fencing,

36
00:01:22,526 --> 00:01:23,696
so only for today...

37
00:01:24,066 --> 00:01:25,835
- I see. - I look like Jae Hyeon,

38
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:28,365
- and I'm acting as his avatar. - Okay.

39
00:01:28,366 --> 00:01:29,506
I'm actually Sang Uk.

40
00:01:29,766 --> 00:01:31,065
- We'll think that you're Sang Uk. - Yes.

41
00:01:31,066 --> 00:01:32,805
I'm Jae Hyeon, but I'm Sang Uk.

42
00:01:32,806 --> 00:01:33,806
Nice.

43
00:01:33,807 --> 00:01:34,935
- Suddenly? - All of a sudden?

44
00:01:34,936 --> 00:01:35,945
It's snowing again.

45
00:01:35,946 --> 00:01:36,975
- Goodness. - It's snowing.

46
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:38,345
- It's snowing. - Gosh.

47
00:01:38,346 --> 00:01:39,845
Shall we invite the guest...

48
00:01:39,846 --> 00:01:41,445
- who came with the heavy snow? - Yes.

49
00:01:41,446 --> 00:01:42,985
The heavy snow guest.

50
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:44,586
Wait, is that Byeon Woo Seok?

51
00:01:45,716 --> 00:01:47,815
(He crossed the snow field to come here.)

52
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,486
(Today's special guest is...)

53
00:01:51,086 --> 00:01:55,596
(Lovely Runner who came with the heavy snow?)

54
00:01:56,926 --> 00:01:58,396
It's a snowman.

55
00:01:59,026 --> 00:02:00,765
That's... Hello.

56
00:02:00,766 --> 00:02:02,736
- It's a snowman. - I know him well.

57
00:02:03,066 --> 00:02:04,265
- This is... - It's him.

58
00:02:04,266 --> 00:02:05,435
It's Si Eon.

59
00:02:05,436 --> 00:02:06,505
Hello.

60
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:08,075
- Please introduce yourself. - Hello.

61
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:09,876
I'm Lee Si Eon. It's good to see you.

62
00:02:09,976 --> 00:02:11,045
It's Si Eon.

63
00:02:11,046 --> 00:02:12,676
(Welcome!)

64
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:16,845
(With his unique sneaky acting skills)

65
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:19,985
(He's a scene-stealer with an undeniable presence.)

66
00:02:19,986 --> 00:02:23,686
(He's also on variety shows with his honest look.)

67
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:27,126
(Actor Lee Si Eon, Lovely Runner Si Eon)

68
00:02:28,426 --> 00:02:30,165
You came out next to Byeon Woo Seok's photo.

69
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:32,025
I was surprised to see you come out next to Byeon Woo Seok.

70
00:02:32,026 --> 00:02:33,795
I thought I was going in there with Woo Seok.

71
00:02:33,796 --> 00:02:35,235
(An advertisement poster next to the entrance)

72
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:38,005
Do you know anything about Bonghwa?

73
00:02:38,006 --> 00:02:40,635
I was in Bonghwa for six months for a shoot.

74
00:02:40,636 --> 00:02:42,175
It was for a series called "Modern Farmer."

75
00:02:42,176 --> 00:02:43,246
I see.

76
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:44,775
My nipple got bitten by a puppy.

77
00:02:44,776 --> 00:02:46,046
- Right. - That's famous.

78
00:02:46,246 --> 00:02:47,576
It had ten million views.

79
00:02:48,416 --> 00:02:50,986
(Si Eon, taking care of a puppy on a field leisurely)

80
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:54,955
(It hurts so much.)

81
00:02:54,956 --> 00:02:55,956
Yes.

82
00:02:55,957 --> 00:02:57,856
- It had ten million views. - That was in Bonghwa?

83
00:02:57,956 --> 00:02:59,625
(That's so funny.)

84
00:02:59,626 --> 00:03:02,055
It was shot somewhere in the mountain.

85
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:03,065
Over here?

86
00:03:03,066 --> 00:03:06,435
We have to determine the teams first.

87
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,995
Si Eon, please pick two people for your team.

88
00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:09,865
- This won't be easy. - Divide into 2 teams of 3.

89
00:03:09,866 --> 00:03:11,906
Let me give you some advice beforehand.

90
00:03:12,236 --> 00:03:14,305
Jae Hyeon is good too.

91
00:03:14,306 --> 00:03:15,675
(Jae Hyeon is good too.)

92
00:03:15,676 --> 00:03:18,376
When he was here last time, he didn't get the penalty.

93
00:03:18,646 --> 00:03:19,916
That's all I will tell you.

94
00:03:20,316 --> 00:03:22,985
I don't think he's particularly smart.

95
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:24,145
When I was in a drama with him,

96
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:25,515
I made a lot of mistakes.

97
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:27,586
- So he knows you. - He knows me.

98
00:03:28,156 --> 00:03:29,885
Since I'm close to Yi Kyung,

99
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:31,286
I'd like him on my team.

100
00:03:31,886 --> 00:03:33,226
I'm always on the same team as the guest.

101
00:03:34,056 --> 00:03:36,295
- I pick him first. - Okay.

102
00:03:36,296 --> 00:03:37,466
Who else?

103
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,496
I pick Tae Hyun.

104
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,695
- Wait. - Us three?

105
00:03:40,696 --> 00:03:42,366
- Hold on. - Time-out.

106
00:03:42,536 --> 00:03:44,706
Wait a minute, time-out.

107
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:46,935
My goodness.

108
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:48,606
It's the team that you dread the most.

109
00:03:48,876 --> 00:03:51,445
In our group chat room,

110
00:03:51,446 --> 00:03:53,045
we were discussing our guest for today.

111
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:56,045
These two are the aces on the show.

112
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:58,115
"We've never been on the same team, have we?"

113
00:03:58,116 --> 00:03:59,655
"Why don't we team up tomorrow?"

114
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,315
That's how the conversation ended yesterday.

115
00:04:01,316 --> 00:04:04,126
You must have talked about it beforehand.

116
00:04:04,226 --> 00:04:05,995
- No. - We didn't discuss it beforehand.

117
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:07,255
During our shoot for "Amazing Saturday,"

118
00:04:07,256 --> 00:04:08,755
Dong Hyun was sitting next to me.

119
00:04:08,756 --> 00:04:10,726
You kept looking down.

120
00:04:11,966 --> 00:04:13,295
(I won't team up with him.)

121
00:04:13,296 --> 00:04:15,736
He was doodling on his notepad.

122
00:04:16,106 --> 00:04:18,466
That's true. It's because I don't know anything.

123
00:04:18,636 --> 00:04:21,876
I thought that Dong Hyun was someone who doesn't participate.

124
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:23,945
In my opinion,

125
00:04:23,946 --> 00:04:26,245
Si Eon picked two members he feels the most comfortable with.

126
00:04:26,246 --> 00:04:27,846
You two are on the same team?

127
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:29,546
- Gosh, this is... - We're in trouble.

128
00:04:30,616 --> 00:04:31,716
Goodness.

129
00:04:32,416 --> 00:04:34,485
(It's quite difficult for both of them.)

130
00:04:34,486 --> 00:04:35,986
- Gosh. - Goodness.

131
00:04:36,686 --> 00:04:37,686
Wait.

132
00:04:38,086 --> 00:04:39,326
- Seung Ho, are you okay? - Seung Ho.

133
00:04:39,926 --> 00:04:41,495
- I'm happy with Seung Ho. - Dong Hyun.

134
00:04:41,496 --> 00:04:43,226
I have a lot on my mind now.

135
00:04:43,696 --> 00:04:44,795
Seung Ho, come here.

136
00:04:44,796 --> 00:04:45,965
This will be fun.

137
00:04:45,966 --> 00:04:47,495
- In this case... - This isn't good.

138
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,096
- Their physique... - Their height...

139
00:04:49,236 --> 00:04:51,166
It's a team with good physique versus...

140
00:04:51,306 --> 00:04:53,276
a team of short guys.

141
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:54,675
Let's team up like this.

142
00:04:54,676 --> 00:04:56,706
- Si Eon's team is Team Handsome. - It will be fun.

143
00:04:56,846 --> 00:04:59,445
Their team will be Team Guys.

144
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:01,075
He's smart, isn't he?

145
00:05:01,076 --> 00:05:02,276
- He is. - He's competent.

146
00:05:02,446 --> 00:05:03,715
Our leader is Seung Ho.

147
00:05:03,716 --> 00:05:05,816
I'm not the leader type.

148
00:05:06,186 --> 00:05:07,855
I always support others.

149
00:05:07,856 --> 00:05:09,285
For fun,

150
00:05:09,286 --> 00:05:11,426
do you have any quiz for the three of them?

151
00:05:11,626 --> 00:05:13,626
- I know something interesting. - What?

152
00:05:14,126 --> 00:05:15,396
- You know Chunhyang? - Yes.

153
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:17,025
- Do you know her last name? - I do.

154
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,026
- You do? - Seong Chunhyang.
Seong Chunhyang.

155
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:22,096
- You didn't know that? - We're in big trouble.

156
00:05:22,396 --> 00:05:23,635
- How about... - Did you know that?

157
00:05:23,636 --> 00:05:25,165
What about the opposite of Chunhyang?

158
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:26,305
The opposite?

159
00:05:26,306 --> 00:05:27,475
- You mean, Mongryong? - Mongryong.

160
00:05:27,476 --> 00:05:28,876
His last name is Lee.

161
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:32,446
I'm sorry, but could you stay quiet?

162
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,176
- Just be quiet. - Okay.

163
00:05:35,646 --> 00:05:37,616
- What if... - I'm okay with this.

164
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:38,745
Wait.

165
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:40,915
- This is your last chance. - Your points might get deducted.

166
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,255
You'd better stay quiet.

167
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:43,986
By the way, rules have changed.

168
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:45,256
That sounds good.

169
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:46,855
(Explaining today's game rules)

170
00:05:46,856 --> 00:05:48,596
- We need variables. - Did something change?

171
00:05:48,726 --> 00:05:50,365
You won't be playing bingo.

172
00:05:50,366 --> 00:05:51,396
I see.

173
00:05:51,426 --> 00:05:54,435
Each team will go to destinations...

174
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:56,465
that are predetermined.

175
00:05:56,466 --> 00:05:57,906
You'll do the quiz there.

176
00:05:58,466 --> 00:06:00,275
Do we have the same number of quizzes?

177
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,276
- Yes. - I see.

178
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,305
Which team answers more quizzes?

179
00:06:02,306 --> 00:06:03,506
It will be about what we know.

180
00:06:03,646 --> 00:06:06,075
The team with the higher final score will win.

181
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:07,916
Based on the number of questions we answer?

182
00:06:08,316 --> 00:06:11,446
(When they get the quiz right, special local food is provided.)

183
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:13,315
Today's Handsome Heritage is...

184
00:06:13,316 --> 00:06:15,956
buildings in North Gyeongsang Province.

185
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:18,285
North Gyeongsang Province is known for its wooden materials.

186
00:06:18,286 --> 00:06:19,495
- As such, - Wooden materials?

187
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:21,856
There are many old buildings that are well-built.

188
00:06:21,926 --> 00:06:23,625
Among contemporary buildings,

189
00:06:23,626 --> 00:06:26,396
many of them are built well with wood.

190
00:06:26,536 --> 00:06:28,936
We will visit such places today.

191
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:32,265
- Buildings? - Buildings are interesting.

192
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:34,405
We invited guests who will introduce the buildings.

193
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:35,406
Please come out.

194
00:06:35,736 --> 00:06:36,776
Our professors.

195
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:38,246
They're a married couple.

196
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:40,215
- Hello. - Welcome.

197
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:41,815
- Hello. - Hello.

198
00:06:41,816 --> 00:06:42,986
You came again today.

199
00:06:43,346 --> 00:06:44,385
Hello.

200
00:06:44,386 --> 00:06:46,555
- I'm Architect Roh Eun Joo. - I'm Lim Hyoung Nam.

201
00:06:46,556 --> 00:06:48,755
It's good to see both of you.

202
00:06:48,756 --> 00:06:50,755
Many people return to our show.

203
00:06:50,756 --> 00:06:53,056
How would you like to choose your team?

204
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:55,395
Based on what I observed,

205
00:06:55,396 --> 00:06:57,625
I'll eat well with this team.

206
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:58,696
(This team would eat well.)

207
00:06:58,926 --> 00:07:00,435
- Welcome. - That's great.

208
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:01,936
- Welcome to our team. - I'd like to eat well today.

209
00:07:02,566 --> 00:07:04,106
All right. She'll join us then.

210
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:05,505
We will see...

211
00:07:05,506 --> 00:07:07,705
- the architects in a few moments. - See you later.

212
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:09,136
Thank you. See you later.

213
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:11,675
- Okay. - Based on your final score,

214
00:07:11,676 --> 00:07:12,946
- for the losing team, - Yes.

215
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:15,346
There will be an activity as always.

216
00:07:15,646 --> 00:07:17,586
The activity in North Gyeongsang Province is...

217
00:07:18,746 --> 00:07:21,286
- helping out at the cucumber farm. - Cucumber farm?

218
00:07:23,286 --> 00:07:25,826
(Come and pick cucumbers.)

219
00:07:25,956 --> 00:07:27,326
- Cucumber? - Cucumber farm?

220
00:07:27,496 --> 00:07:28,596
- Cucumber... - Cucumber?

221
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:31,166
Doesn't Dong Hyun look like a cucumber?

222
00:07:33,836 --> 00:07:35,636
Hey, we're on the same team.

223
00:07:35,696 --> 00:07:38,835
- You treat your teammate like this? - Give him a hug.

224
00:07:38,836 --> 00:07:40,936
- Give him a hug. - We're on the same team.

225
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:42,135
Goodness.

226
00:07:42,136 --> 00:07:43,145
Stuffed cucumber kimchi.

227
00:07:43,146 --> 00:07:44,405
If you go there,

228
00:07:44,406 --> 00:07:46,275
you'll promote cucumbers even more.

229
00:07:46,276 --> 00:07:47,745
Because of his orange hoodie, he looks like...

230
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:49,585
- stuffed cucumber kimchi. - I mean...

231
00:07:49,586 --> 00:07:50,945
He wants to send Dong Hyun.

232
00:07:50,946 --> 00:07:52,146
We're on the same team.

233
00:07:52,246 --> 00:07:54,355
Promotion for cucumber has nothing to do with me.

234
00:07:54,356 --> 00:07:55,485
He's looking at the bigger picture.

235
00:07:55,486 --> 00:07:56,626
I'm in trouble.

236
00:07:57,456 --> 00:07:58,956
Before you depart,

237
00:07:59,156 --> 00:08:02,455
what's the most important for winning the quiz?

238
00:08:02,456 --> 00:08:04,766
- The reattempt card. - The reattempt card is crucial.

239
00:08:04,796 --> 00:08:07,735
For a reattempt card,

240
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:10,266
you'll play a relay speed quiz.

241
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:12,536
(What is a relay speed quiz?)

242
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:14,376
(Three players lined up in a row.)

243
00:08:14,476 --> 00:08:16,576
(The 1st player reads the keyword.)

244
00:08:16,706 --> 00:08:18,876
(He explains to the next player only with his body.)

245
00:08:19,246 --> 00:08:22,246
(The 2nd player explains only in words.)

246
00:08:22,576 --> 00:08:25,385
(When the last player answers correctly, they win a point.)

247
00:08:25,386 --> 00:08:28,056
(Only the last player can skip.)

248
00:08:28,086 --> 00:08:29,756
(3 minutes, 2 rounds)

249
00:08:30,286 --> 00:08:33,196
(Which team will win the reattempt card?)

250
00:08:34,026 --> 00:08:35,555
This is the real battlefield.

251
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,466
- I'm bad at this. - We have to be good at everything.

252
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,096
- How do I explain in words? - Listen.

253
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,366
Here's what I think.

254
00:08:41,436 --> 00:08:42,665
- They'll give us proverbs. - What?

255
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:43,765
- Proverbs. - Right.

256
00:08:43,766 --> 00:08:45,236
We need to agree on something.

257
00:08:45,836 --> 00:08:47,506
For example, here's a basic one.

258
00:08:47,636 --> 00:08:49,646
"Even a worm will turn."

259
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:54,475
"Even a worm will turn."

260
00:08:54,476 --> 00:08:56,145
There are three major words in the sentence.

261
00:08:56,146 --> 00:08:57,286
Let's do it this way.

262
00:08:57,386 --> 00:08:58,485
(Keyword karate chop)

263
00:08:58,486 --> 00:08:59,486
- Okay. - That's it.

264
00:08:59,487 --> 00:09:01,115
That's excellent. You're so smart.

265
00:09:01,116 --> 00:09:02,255
The winner decides the order.

266
00:09:02,256 --> 00:09:03,355
Our youngest is up.

267
00:09:03,356 --> 00:09:05,255
- The winner decides the order. - The winner decides the order.

268
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:07,125
Wait, the winner? What should we do?

269
00:09:07,126 --> 00:09:08,696
- Win first. - Okay.

270
00:09:09,226 --> 00:09:11,796
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

271
00:09:11,826 --> 00:09:14,465
- Okay. - It's a relay.

272
00:09:14,466 --> 00:09:15,836
- Forget it. - What is he saying?

273
00:09:15,866 --> 00:09:17,135
- Seriously? - Yes.

274
00:09:17,136 --> 00:09:18,366
- Okay. - Okay, this is good.

275
00:09:18,436 --> 00:09:20,306
- We'll win everything. - We'll start.

276
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:21,705
- Aren't you going? - Listen.

277
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:23,475
The more you get right within three minutes, the better it is.

278
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,875
- It isn't just one keyword. - That's usually the case in games.

279
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:27,116
- Really? - I didn't hear you.

280
00:09:27,176 --> 00:09:28,345
- What did he say? - I mean,

281
00:09:28,346 --> 00:09:30,845
- I thought there was one keyword. - Can I switch teams?

282
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:31,846
I thought there was only one.

283
00:09:31,847 --> 00:09:34,386
Dong Hyun, don't make it harder than it is.

284
00:09:34,956 --> 00:09:36,426
You need to guess quickly, okay?

285
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:38,156
I will do my best.

286
00:09:38,356 --> 00:09:39,455
Here's the theme.

287
00:09:39,456 --> 00:09:40,456
(Team Guys' theme, proverbs)

288
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:41,795
That's good.

289
00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:42,796
- Good. - Okay.

290
00:09:42,797 --> 00:09:44,126
- It's what we expected. - Okay.

291
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,365
- I don't know any proverbs. - Now...

292
00:09:45,366 --> 00:09:47,796
All right, here we go.

293
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:49,196
Start.

294
00:09:49,436 --> 00:09:51,465
(Time limit of 3 minutes)

295
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,806
(Even a worm will turn.)

296
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:54,975
This is incredible.

297
00:09:54,976 --> 00:09:57,005
Don't talk.

298
00:09:57,006 --> 00:09:58,375
(Even a worm...)

299
00:09:58,376 --> 00:09:59,405
(will turn.)

300
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:01,045
- Don't talk. - You can't moan either.

301
00:10:01,046 --> 00:10:02,046
Don't talk.

302
00:10:02,047 --> 00:10:04,646
It's the example I used a moment ago.

303
00:10:04,716 --> 00:10:07,586
It's the example I said.

304
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:09,316
Even a worm will turn.

305
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:10,755
- Correct. - Okay.

306
00:10:10,756 --> 00:10:12,626
- Please talk faster. - Okay.

307
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:14,555
(An innocent bystander gets hurt a fight.)

308
00:10:14,556 --> 00:10:15,656
(Exclaiming)

309
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:17,365
(First, he expresses with his body.)

310
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:22,435
(An innocent bystander gets hurt a fight.)

311
00:10:22,436 --> 00:10:23,465
Can he stop that?

312
00:10:23,466 --> 00:10:24,466
(Whale)

313
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,036
(Fight!)

314
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:27,576
(Okay)

315
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:29,376
- Keep watching me. - Right.

316
00:10:29,636 --> 00:10:30,676
He got it.

317
00:10:30,876 --> 00:10:32,346
It's hard to explain in words.

318
00:10:33,016 --> 00:10:34,645
(Yes, Jae Hyeon.)

319
00:10:34,646 --> 00:10:37,145
(It's very difficult.)

320
00:10:37,146 --> 00:10:38,216
- Hurry up. - All right.

321
00:10:38,516 --> 00:10:39,815
- We don't have time. - One minute is up.

322
00:10:39,816 --> 00:10:42,655
- Prawn. - Okay.

323
00:10:42,656 --> 00:10:44,725
- It's big. - A proverb related to prawn.

324
00:10:44,726 --> 00:10:45,856
Which one is the easiest?

325
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:47,625
An innocent bystander gets hurt in a fight.

326
00:10:47,626 --> 00:10:49,056
- Correct. - This is amazing.

327
00:10:49,296 --> 00:10:51,026
How did he know that?

328
00:10:51,596 --> 00:10:53,966
(Viewers, try to guess this one.)

329
00:11:02,406 --> 00:11:03,876
(He hugs it.)

330
00:11:05,406 --> 00:11:06,476
(A faucet)

331
00:11:07,046 --> 00:11:08,245
It's a faucet.

332
00:11:08,246 --> 00:11:09,616
(Smashing?)

333
00:11:09,846 --> 00:11:10,986
It's quite long.

334
00:11:11,346 --> 00:11:13,186
- Can you explain to me? - We don't have time.

335
00:11:13,356 --> 00:11:14,455
Is it hard?

336
00:11:14,456 --> 00:11:15,716
I'll do the same.

337
00:11:15,956 --> 00:11:18,086
- You can't make movements. - You can't do that.

338
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,556
Hurry up.

339
00:11:19,826 --> 00:11:21,155
(I have to explain only in words?)

340
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:25,126
It's like getting hurt by someone...

341
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:27,396
whom you trust a lot.

342
00:11:28,636 --> 00:11:30,365
- Is it painful? - I mean,

343
00:11:30,366 --> 00:11:31,706
it could actually be painful.

344
00:11:33,206 --> 00:11:34,335
Getting stabbed in the back.

345
00:11:34,336 --> 00:11:35,705
The phrase should be longer.

346
00:11:35,706 --> 00:11:37,075
Getting stabbed in the back by someone you trust.

347
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:38,545
- Incorrect. - Hurry up.

348
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:39,975
- Do you want to skip it? - Skip.

349
00:11:39,976 --> 00:11:40,976
(They have about 1 minute left.)

350
00:11:40,977 --> 00:11:42,576
- Okay. - Don't talk.

351
00:11:42,846 --> 00:11:44,045
Stay calm.

352
00:11:44,046 --> 00:11:45,086
(I have bigger fish to fry.)

353
00:11:46,286 --> 00:11:48,215
- Jae Hyeon, watch. - We don't have time.

354
00:11:48,216 --> 00:11:49,386
I have...

355
00:11:49,556 --> 00:11:51,555
(How do I explain it in words?)

356
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:53,826
- Can you hurry up? - Yes.

357
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:55,056
The holes.

358
00:11:55,496 --> 00:11:57,626
- The nostrils? - Think simple.

359
00:11:57,966 --> 00:12:00,536
Three. The phrase has five syllables.

360
00:12:01,336 --> 00:12:02,436
My nostrils.

361
00:12:03,106 --> 00:12:04,436
Nice, Jae Hyeon.

362
00:12:04,906 --> 00:12:06,136
Jae Hyeon, you're doing well.

363
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,376
We're in trouble.

364
00:12:07,436 --> 00:12:09,306
- Shall we go to the cucumber farm? - Five, four,

365
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:10,705
- Just say anything. - three,

366
00:12:10,706 --> 00:12:11,845
- two, - My philtrum is the nose.

367
00:12:11,846 --> 00:12:12,846
- one. - What is it?

368
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:14,715
- Incorrect. - What was the proverb?

369
00:12:14,716 --> 00:12:16,316
I have bigger fish to fry.

370
00:12:17,286 --> 00:12:19,446
It was supposed to be a proverb.

371
00:12:19,856 --> 00:12:20,856
Bigger fish to fry.

372
00:12:20,857 --> 00:12:21,986
(I told you that I don't many proverbs.)

373
00:12:22,256 --> 00:12:23,825
- Well done. - You got two right.

374
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,756
- Explaining is hard. - Explaining is hard.

375
00:12:25,826 --> 00:12:27,956
This is how powerful reattempt cards are.

376
00:12:28,556 --> 00:12:30,496
You should stand here first.

377
00:12:30,996 --> 00:12:32,365
Okay.

378
00:12:32,366 --> 00:12:34,365
- What's the theme? - Okay.

379
00:12:34,366 --> 00:12:35,436
The theme is movies.

380
00:12:35,566 --> 00:12:36,765
(Movies?)

381
00:12:36,766 --> 00:12:37,866
Movies are easy enough.

382
00:12:37,906 --> 00:12:39,335
You can't say actors' names.

383
00:12:39,336 --> 00:12:41,205
- We can't say actors' names? - Why not?

384
00:12:41,206 --> 00:12:42,406
You can't say directors' names either.

385
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:44,645
That's why we told you that it was difficult.

386
00:12:44,646 --> 00:12:45,746
(Being annoying)

387
00:12:45,906 --> 00:12:47,016
Let's give it a try. Who knows?

388
00:12:47,446 --> 00:12:49,315
Ready, set, go.

389
00:12:49,316 --> 00:12:51,645
(Time limit of 3 minutes)

390
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:52,646
("Spider-Man")

391
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:53,886
(Like this)

392
00:12:53,986 --> 00:12:55,786
(Okay, he got it.)

393
00:12:57,456 --> 00:12:59,355
- He got bitten by a spider. - "Spider-Man."

394
00:12:59,356 --> 00:13:00,356
Correct.

395
00:13:00,357 --> 00:13:01,796
(It took only 10 seconds.)

396
00:13:01,856 --> 00:13:03,096
This is easy.

397
00:13:03,566 --> 00:13:05,895
("Exhuma")

398
00:13:05,896 --> 00:13:07,066
This is...

399
00:13:07,136 --> 00:13:08,696
Si Eon is very good at it.

400
00:13:08,796 --> 00:13:09,936
He dug the ground.

401
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:11,866
- He dug the ground. - It's a construction site.

402
00:13:12,106 --> 00:13:13,335
Can you express something else?

403
00:13:13,336 --> 00:13:15,235
(Dig out the grave.)

404
00:13:15,236 --> 00:13:16,806
Hurry up, or I can skip it.

405
00:13:17,106 --> 00:13:18,206
This is...

406
00:13:18,276 --> 00:13:20,015
- Can they do that? We'll do it too. - Is it a grave?

407
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:21,746
- He's constructing a building. - A grave.

408
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,145
Hurry up.

409
00:13:23,146 --> 00:13:24,385
I'll just do it.

410
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,485
Tae Hyun. Wait, I can't do that.

411
00:13:26,486 --> 00:13:29,255
There's a grave, and you dig it out.

412
00:13:29,256 --> 00:13:30,585
That must be it.

413
00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:31,926
- "Exhuma." - Correct.

414
00:13:31,956 --> 00:13:33,196
My goodness.

415
00:13:33,856 --> 00:13:36,295
(They already earned 2 points.)

416
00:13:36,296 --> 00:13:37,426
I realized what it was.

417
00:13:37,696 --> 00:13:39,025
("Train to Busan")

418
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,865
(Zombies?)

419
00:13:40,866 --> 00:13:41,936
Okay.

420
00:13:42,466 --> 00:13:43,566
This is a hard one.

421
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:46,736
(What type of zombie will Si Eon demonstrate?)

422
00:13:49,946 --> 00:13:51,776
(What's that?)

423
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:55,276
It sounds like...

424
00:13:55,746 --> 00:13:57,086
Si Eon is being active.

425
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,215
If he's moving about that much...

426
00:13:59,216 --> 00:14:00,216
(A fancy zombie movement)

427
00:14:00,217 --> 00:14:01,516
Is he moving that much?

428
00:14:01,716 --> 00:14:02,815
He's good at it.

429
00:14:02,816 --> 00:14:04,186
- It must be an action movie. - He's good at it.

430
00:14:04,356 --> 00:14:05,455
Is he moving that much?

431
00:14:05,456 --> 00:14:06,626
(Zombie)

432
00:14:06,796 --> 00:14:08,995
What could it be? I don't get the end.

433
00:14:08,996 --> 00:14:10,425
(A man with a big build must be Ma Dong Seok.)

434
00:14:10,426 --> 00:14:11,926
- Si Eon is good. - What's that?

435
00:14:12,096 --> 00:14:15,236
(Zombie Si Eon is getting exhausted.)

436
00:14:15,266 --> 00:14:16,666
I'm so tired.

437
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:19,205
- He's being strange. Tae Hyun. - Go ahead.

438
00:14:19,206 --> 00:14:20,605
Can you skip it?

439
00:14:20,606 --> 00:14:23,176
Skip. What was that about?

440
00:14:23,306 --> 00:14:25,576
(How dare you skip this one?)

441
00:14:26,346 --> 00:14:27,715
- This is... - Darn it.

442
00:14:27,716 --> 00:14:28,945
(The scores are still tied.)

443
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:30,715
- We just need one more. - What?

444
00:14:30,716 --> 00:14:31,716
("My Sassy Girl")

445
00:14:31,717 --> 00:14:32,785
(Him)

446
00:14:32,786 --> 00:14:33,786
(Kyun Woo!)

447
00:14:35,556 --> 00:14:37,225
The most famous movie you were in.

448
00:14:37,226 --> 00:14:38,485
- Me? "Along with the Gods." - Yes.

449
00:14:38,486 --> 00:14:39,925
- Not that one. - "My Sassy Girl."

450
00:14:39,926 --> 00:14:41,096
- Yes. - Correct.

451
00:14:41,126 --> 00:14:42,526
(Screaming with joy)

452
00:14:42,796 --> 00:14:44,796
(Team Handsome earned 1 more point than Team Guys.)

453
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,635
You're turning the page slowly on purpose.

454
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:47,636
Goodness.

455
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:50,665
I was trying to turn it quickly. Why are you getting angry?

456
00:14:50,666 --> 00:14:53,375
- Hurry up. You don't work here. - I'm working hard.

457
00:14:53,376 --> 00:14:54,436
Hurry up.

458
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:56,305
I was only working hard.

459
00:14:56,306 --> 00:14:57,446
Hurry up!

460
00:14:57,946 --> 00:14:59,076
("Bohemian Rhapsody")

461
00:14:59,176 --> 00:15:00,345
What is it?

462
00:15:00,346 --> 00:15:01,515
("Bohemian Rhapsody")

463
00:15:01,516 --> 00:15:02,576
(Moustache)

464
00:15:04,946 --> 00:15:06,855
- Hurry. - It seems like a foreign movie.

465
00:15:06,856 --> 00:15:09,215
- It's a singer with a moustache. - Four,

466
00:15:09,216 --> 00:15:12,725
- three, two, one. - Is it about Freddie Mercury?

467
00:15:12,726 --> 00:15:13,756
Time is up.

468
00:15:14,026 --> 00:15:15,026
(Time is up for Team Handsome's Round 1.)
- Was that right? - Yes.

469
00:15:16,027 --> 00:15:18,365
- He didn't say the title. - "Bohemian Rhapsody?"

470
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:19,366
(Current score)

471
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:21,166
(Handsome 3:2 Guys)

472
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:23,235
Do you want to go before us this time?

473
00:15:23,236 --> 00:15:24,565
- No, go ahead. - No.

474
00:15:24,566 --> 00:15:25,765
(No)

475
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:27,005
- Let's look at the theme. - The theme is...

476
00:15:27,006 --> 00:15:28,006
Show them the theme.

477
00:15:28,007 --> 00:15:29,135
It's what you like.

478
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,145
- What is it? - It's food.

479
00:15:30,146 --> 00:15:31,176
Food.

480
00:15:31,706 --> 00:15:32,775
Food? Okay.

481
00:15:32,776 --> 00:15:34,616
- Food is hard. It's ambiguous. - It's hard.

482
00:15:34,676 --> 00:15:36,576
- It's very hard. - Details are important.

483
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:39,585
You must be able to distinguish between noodles and rice.

484
00:15:39,586 --> 00:15:40,685
- Of course. - All right.

485
00:15:40,686 --> 00:15:42,385
- Okay. - We'll get started.

486
00:15:42,386 --> 00:15:45,025
We can do it.

487
00:15:45,026 --> 00:15:46,755
How much can I say?

488
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:47,926
I'll cheer for myself.

489
00:15:48,156 --> 00:15:49,396
(Laughing)

490
00:15:49,956 --> 00:15:51,096
Start.

491
00:15:51,796 --> 00:15:54,066
- This is a good one. - Gosh.

492
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:55,496
(Twisting)

493
00:15:56,196 --> 00:15:57,205
(Twisting)

494
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,836
A squid.

495
00:15:59,636 --> 00:16:01,635
- It's delicious when grilled. - Right.

496
00:16:01,636 --> 00:16:02,805
It's very good when grilled.

497
00:16:02,806 --> 00:16:04,305
Time-out. Wait a minute.

498
00:16:04,306 --> 00:16:05,445
They can't interfere like this.

499
00:16:05,446 --> 00:16:06,876
You did it too.

500
00:16:06,976 --> 00:16:08,116
Why...

501
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:09,675
It looks very good when grilled.

502
00:16:09,676 --> 00:16:11,246
It looks like a thin-legged octopus.

503
00:16:12,116 --> 00:16:13,985
- Tell me what Jae Hyeon explained. - He's twisted.

504
00:16:13,986 --> 00:16:15,385
Say it in words.

505
00:16:15,386 --> 00:16:16,725
He kept twisting himself.

506
00:16:16,726 --> 00:16:17,925
- Twisted donut? - Correct.

507
00:16:17,926 --> 00:16:19,086
- What? - Correct.

508
00:16:19,356 --> 00:16:20,356
What?

509
00:16:20,357 --> 00:16:22,526
(I was cool.)

510
00:16:22,656 --> 00:16:24,365
(Nice, Seung Ho.)

511
00:16:24,366 --> 00:16:25,466
Hurry up.

512
00:16:26,226 --> 00:16:27,266
(Budae jjigae)

513
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,095
Hurry up.

514
00:16:29,096 --> 00:16:30,105
This is amazing.

515
00:16:30,106 --> 00:16:31,106
(Budae jjigae is very difficult.)

516
00:16:31,107 --> 00:16:33,065
- This is amazing. - Listen to the question.

517
00:16:33,066 --> 00:16:34,205
(Salute)

518
00:16:34,206 --> 00:16:35,575
(Budae stew)

519
00:16:35,576 --> 00:16:36,576
(Salute)

520
00:16:36,577 --> 00:16:37,806
Okay.

521
00:16:37,906 --> 00:16:39,405
Hey, listen.

522
00:16:39,406 --> 00:16:40,845
It must be something you eat in the military.

523
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:42,676
It's very crunchy.

524
00:16:43,046 --> 00:16:46,046
- I saw him march politely. - It's very crunchy.

525
00:16:46,546 --> 00:16:47,956
It could be hardtack.

526
00:16:49,186 --> 00:16:50,325
- Hey. - You can't say the answer.

527
00:16:50,326 --> 00:16:52,355
- How can you say the answer? - You can't say the answer.

528
00:16:52,356 --> 00:16:53,595
Hardtack.

529
00:16:53,596 --> 00:16:54,625
- What? - That's not it.

530
00:16:54,626 --> 00:16:56,025
- Incorrect. - Why is it wrong?

531
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:58,026
- You need to explain. - Please explain to me.

532
00:16:58,526 --> 00:17:02,496
I saw him salute like a soldier and walk politely.

533
00:17:02,636 --> 00:17:04,265
Take a guess. Don't take too long.

534
00:17:04,266 --> 00:17:05,905
- Skip. - Are you skipping it?

535
00:17:05,906 --> 00:17:06,935
Skip.

536
00:17:06,936 --> 00:17:08,375
- What's the answer? - Turn around.

537
00:17:08,376 --> 00:17:09,435
He skipped it.

538
00:17:09,436 --> 00:17:10,845
(Pork belly)

539
00:17:10,846 --> 00:17:12,246
Is the answer hardtack?

540
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:14,276
Here's the next keyword.

541
00:17:14,346 --> 00:17:15,816
We're going to win.

542
00:17:16,046 --> 00:17:17,445
(Grill)

543
00:17:17,446 --> 00:17:18,485
This one is easy.

544
00:17:18,486 --> 00:17:20,116
- This is really... - Okay, stay calm.

545
00:17:20,156 --> 00:17:22,455
It's the best with soju.

546
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:24,055
It's something people eat the most.

547
00:17:24,056 --> 00:17:25,455
It's pork.

548
00:17:25,456 --> 00:17:27,425
- Something you eat with kimchi. - Kimchi stew?

549
00:17:27,426 --> 00:17:28,796
- Say the answer. - Pork suyuk?

550
00:17:28,956 --> 00:17:30,125
- What? - Jokbal?

551
00:17:30,126 --> 00:17:31,165
- Pork and rice soup? - No...

552
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,166
Gamjatang?
- Pork and rice soup? - No...

553
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,166
Gamjatang?

554
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:35,495
(Knocked out)

555
00:17:35,496 --> 00:17:38,405
- You cook it on a grill. - Pork belly.

556
00:17:38,406 --> 00:17:39,435
- Correct. - That's it.

557
00:17:39,436 --> 00:17:41,735
- Turn around. - Hurry up.

558
00:17:41,736 --> 00:17:43,036
- Show it to me. - Time is up.

559
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:46,406
- This is really hard. - You can do it.

560
00:17:46,646 --> 00:17:48,246
Stay calm.

561
00:17:48,616 --> 00:17:51,345
What's this? Did they agree on something beforehand?

562
00:17:51,346 --> 00:17:53,185
- Clapping? - What's this?

563
00:17:53,186 --> 00:17:55,016
(Infinite clapping and noodles)

564
00:17:55,086 --> 00:17:56,316
What's that?

565
00:17:56,386 --> 00:17:57,685
Okay.

566
00:17:57,686 --> 00:17:58,956
He doesn't understand.

567
00:17:59,056 --> 00:18:02,095
He ate noodles while clapping.

568
00:18:02,096 --> 00:18:04,265
Clapping? What could clapping mean?

569
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:05,395
(What could clapping mean?)

570
00:18:05,396 --> 00:18:08,165
Clapping? I know what it is.

571
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,435
- So? - That's it.

572
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:11,606
- What? - It's what they eat...

573
00:18:11,706 --> 00:18:13,305
in North Korea.

574
00:18:13,306 --> 00:18:14,905
- North Korean noodles. - Pyongyang naengmyeon?

575
00:18:14,906 --> 00:18:16,036
Correct.

576
00:18:16,106 --> 00:18:17,175
What?

577
00:18:17,176 --> 00:18:18,505
(I'm so happy.)

578
00:18:18,506 --> 00:18:19,646
Jae Hyeon.

579
00:18:20,376 --> 00:18:21,845
How did he know about this?

580
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:23,075
That's unbelievable.

581
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:25,085
(Hotteok)

582
00:18:25,086 --> 00:18:26,616
(Something hot)

583
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:27,985
It's so cold.

584
00:18:27,986 --> 00:18:29,355
(Blowing)

585
00:18:29,356 --> 00:18:30,356
(Press and flip over)

586
00:18:30,357 --> 00:18:31,455
I know this.

587
00:18:31,456 --> 00:18:33,086
Why did you flip that?

588
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:34,325
Stop talking.

589
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:37,095
(Press, flip over, press)

590
00:18:37,096 --> 00:18:38,366
(Eat)

591
00:18:38,796 --> 00:18:40,025
(There isn't much time left.)

592
00:18:40,026 --> 00:18:42,236
- It was in "Squid Game." - Three, two...

593
00:18:42,596 --> 00:18:43,805
(Dalgona)

594
00:18:43,806 --> 00:18:45,565
- Incorrect. - Dalgona.

595
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:46,705
That's not it.

596
00:18:46,706 --> 00:18:47,806
It was hotteok.

597
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,546
- You pressed it. - Hotteok.

598
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:53,006
Team Guys got five keywords.

599
00:18:53,146 --> 00:18:55,416
Okay, show us the theme.

600
00:18:55,546 --> 00:18:56,676
The theme is...

601
00:18:57,316 --> 00:18:59,145
- This is hard. - It's difficult.

602
00:18:59,146 --> 00:19:00,185
Songs.

603
00:19:00,186 --> 00:19:02,415
- What's this? - Song titles...

604
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,755
Do we have to guess the song title?

605
00:19:03,756 --> 00:19:05,255
You have to guess the song title.

606
00:19:05,256 --> 00:19:08,255
The first player can dance to the song.

607
00:19:08,256 --> 00:19:10,165
The second player can't say the singer's name...

608
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:11,695
or the lyrics.

609
00:19:11,696 --> 00:19:13,596
Then how would we guess which song it is?

610
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,366
The choreography...

611
00:19:15,436 --> 00:19:17,866
There are so many famous dances.

612
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:19,966
We lost. Let's try it.

613
00:19:20,306 --> 00:19:21,536
Even though we lost, try it anyway.

614
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:23,136
We lost. Try it.

615
00:19:23,606 --> 00:19:24,606
Let's try it.

616
00:19:24,607 --> 00:19:26,075
We have no choice but to do it.

617
00:19:26,076 --> 00:19:27,346
Are you ready?

618
00:19:27,546 --> 00:19:29,945
- Get ready, set... - I don't know song titles.

619
00:19:29,946 --> 00:19:31,515
(The last round to win the reattempt card)

620
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:32,685
Go.

621
00:19:32,686 --> 00:19:35,455
(Time limit of 3 minutes)

622
00:19:35,456 --> 00:19:37,425
(Staring)

623
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,455
(I know.)

624
00:19:38,456 --> 00:19:39,586
Okay.

625
00:19:40,626 --> 00:19:41,796
He doesn't know.

626
00:19:42,356 --> 00:19:43,625
These days,

627
00:19:43,626 --> 00:19:45,826
a song with a foreign singer...

628
00:19:45,866 --> 00:19:47,035
and Korean...

629
00:19:47,036 --> 00:19:48,266
- "APT." - Correct.

630
00:19:48,996 --> 00:19:51,005
- Is this correct? - Yes, hurry up.

631
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:53,005
- Shouldn't he say the exact words? - Hurry up.

632
00:19:53,006 --> 00:19:54,336
Turn the page already.

633
00:19:55,036 --> 00:19:58,875
("Candy in My Ear" by Baek Z Young)

634
00:19:58,876 --> 00:20:01,275
(In my ear)

635
00:20:01,276 --> 00:20:02,415
It tickles.

636
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:03,445
Okay.

637
00:20:03,446 --> 00:20:05,685
This is...

638
00:20:05,686 --> 00:20:08,956
the best female ballad singer in Korea.

639
00:20:08,986 --> 00:20:11,085
She sang many soundtracks. It's 1 of the 2.

640
00:20:11,086 --> 00:20:12,855
- It's either Baek Z Young or Gummy. - Exactly.

641
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:15,025
That's good. It's the first person.

642
00:20:15,026 --> 00:20:17,025
It's a dance song that she sang with someone else.

643
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:18,426
- "Candy in My Ear." - That's right.

644
00:20:18,726 --> 00:20:20,166
(That's it.)

645
00:20:20,366 --> 00:20:21,635
The scores are tied.

646
00:20:21,636 --> 00:20:24,165
(The scores got tied in an instant.)

647
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,866
- It's been 1 minute and 20 seconds. - Show it to me.

648
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:27,405
By the way,

649
00:20:27,406 --> 00:20:30,306
Si Eon is good at dancing.

650
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,175
(Lee Si Eon, a speed dancer from North Gyeongsang Province)

651
00:20:32,176 --> 00:20:33,275
Hurry.

652
00:20:33,276 --> 00:20:35,216
(Lee Si Eon, a speed dancer from North Gyeongsang Province)

653
00:20:35,476 --> 00:20:37,045
He's good at dancing.

654
00:20:37,046 --> 00:20:38,245
- What's that? - What's this?

655
00:20:38,246 --> 00:20:39,345
Are you feeling unwell?

656
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:42,185
("UP AND DOWN" by EXID)

657
00:20:42,186 --> 00:20:44,125
(He's definitely a talented dancer.)

658
00:20:44,126 --> 00:20:45,255
This is...

659
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:46,755
- Goodness. - To explain it...

660
00:20:46,756 --> 00:20:48,456
It was...

661
00:20:48,556 --> 00:20:50,196
a huge hit...

662
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:53,365
in the military.

663
00:20:53,366 --> 00:20:54,636
Budae jjigae.

664
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:56,165
- It's a girl group. - "Rollin'."

665
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,865
There are two hit songs.

666
00:20:57,866 --> 00:20:59,105
It came before "Rollin'."

667
00:20:59,106 --> 00:21:00,635
The title is...

668
00:21:00,636 --> 00:21:01,935
related to directions.

669
00:21:01,936 --> 00:21:03,435
Not left and right, but...

670
00:21:03,436 --> 00:21:05,346
- "UP AND DOWN." - That's it.

671
00:21:05,746 --> 00:21:07,146
- Is that correct? - Yes.

672
00:21:07,246 --> 00:21:08,745
It's been 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

673
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:10,245
(The tables have turned.)

674
00:21:10,246 --> 00:21:11,445
Can you turn it toward me?

675
00:21:11,446 --> 00:21:12,886
Gosh, Tae Hyun.

What's that?

681
00:21:26,866 --> 00:21:27,966
(It's growling itself.)

682
00:21:28,336 --> 00:21:29,495
Are you barking?

683
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:32,006
(Barking?)

684
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,635

- It's when... - Yes?

694

Si Eon is unbelievable.

Team Handsome won the reattempt card.

700
00:22:04,336 --> 00:22:06,236
That's a bummer.

701
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,506
It's okay.

702
00:22:07,876 --> 00:22:09,135
It's only a start.

703
00:22:09,136 --> 00:22:10,645
They must be giving us only one today.

704
00:22:10,646 --> 00:22:11,875
All right.

705
00:22:11,876 --> 00:22:14,175
You may go to your assigned destination.

706
00:22:14,176 --> 00:22:16,545
- We should go. - We'll follow the itinerary.

707
00:22:16,546 --> 00:22:18,746
- Okay. - See you when we're done.

708
00:22:20,093 --> 00:22:21,823
The reattempt card is important today.

709
00:22:23,083 --> 00:22:24,853
How long will it take?

710
00:22:24,893 --> 00:22:26,253
It'll take 15 minutes.

711
00:22:26,653 --> 00:22:28,922
The locations look good. Let me take a look.

712
00:22:28,923 --> 00:22:31,232
As soon as I got invited to the show,

713
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:33,392
- I bought the book and read it. - Which book?

714
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,932
The book on Korean history.

715
00:22:34,933 --> 00:22:35,933
(Jae Hyeon studied Korean history very hard for a week.)

716
00:22:35,934 --> 00:22:37,332
Is there anything you remember?

717
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,002
- No. - Right?

718
00:22:39,003 --> 00:22:40,003
"No?"

719
00:22:40,004 --> 00:22:41,242
There's a workbook...

720
00:22:41,243 --> 00:22:42,442
- you can finish in seven days. - Right.

721
00:22:42,443 --> 00:22:43,913
That's what I read.

722
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:45,742
The writing was very small.

723
00:22:45,743 --> 00:22:47,812
(Small writing was a problem.)

724
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:50,143
I watched a 4.5-hour video on Korean modern history.

725
00:22:50,183 --> 00:22:51,883
(On his way here)

726
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:55,153
Yesterday, I watched a video for 3.5 hours.

727
00:22:55,183 --> 00:22:56,483
I studied very hard.

728
00:22:57,023 --> 00:22:58,553
I hope to get the quiz right today.

729
00:22:59,893 --> 00:23:01,023
I feel like...

730
00:23:01,323 --> 00:23:02,793
in order to survive...

731
00:23:03,323 --> 00:23:05,292
I keep seeing myself answering questions with Jae Hyeon.

732
00:23:05,293 --> 00:23:07,432
Why do I imagine myself picking cucumbers?

733
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:09,133
- I mean... - No.

734
00:23:09,603 --> 00:23:12,103
It's okay even if we lose.

735
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:14,743
The thrill you feel when you win.

736
00:23:14,803 --> 00:23:15,803
- Right. - I agree with you.
You know what I mean?

737
00:23:16,804 --> 00:23:17,843
That's correct.

738
00:23:18,013 --> 00:23:21,643
(Only those who experienced it know.)

739
00:23:22,183 --> 00:23:26,153
(The dopamine from getting off work on time)

740
00:23:26,283 --> 00:23:27,723
There's one more thing.

741
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,052
I don't want to send them home.

742
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:31,892
- That's what I want to see. - Among them...

743
00:23:31,893 --> 00:23:33,523
I want to see them bickering at each other.

744
00:23:33,653 --> 00:23:34,923
- Right. - Yes.

745
00:23:35,293 --> 00:23:37,022
They probably expect themselves to win.

746
00:23:37,023 --> 00:23:38,333
- Right. - They already think so.

747
00:23:38,393 --> 00:23:40,062
They didn't make it obvious,

748
00:23:40,063 --> 00:23:41,702
but they're looking down on us.

749
00:23:41,703 --> 00:23:42,933
- Right. - I can feel it.

750
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,773
- They don't seem competitive. - Right.

751
00:23:44,903 --> 00:23:46,573
If we catch them off guard...

752
00:23:46,673 --> 00:23:49,342
- and get all three questions right. - That'd be the best.

753
00:23:49,343 --> 00:23:51,642
- That sounds fun. - When they're off guard,

754
00:23:51,643 --> 00:23:53,983
- it's easiest to win. - That's right.

755
00:23:54,213 --> 00:23:56,912
They're going easy on us because they know they'll win.

756
00:23:56,913 --> 00:23:58,652
I don't want that to happen.

757
00:23:58,653 --> 00:24:00,183
(I want to stop them when they're off guard.)

758
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,153
(Team Handsome)

759
00:24:03,623 --> 00:24:06,623
This neighbourhood is beautiful in the spring.

760
00:24:06,723 --> 00:24:09,392
- Here? - Yes, in the spring and summer.

761
00:24:09,393 --> 00:24:11,192
It's an uncontaminated area.

762
00:24:11,193 --> 00:24:12,433
(It's an uncontaminated area.)

763
00:24:13,763 --> 00:24:15,602
This place is...

764
00:24:15,603 --> 00:24:17,432
surrounded by mountains.

765
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:18,773
(The beautiful snowy landscape makes them exclaim today.)

766
00:24:20,173 --> 00:24:21,843
It's nice to drive on the snowy road.

767
00:24:24,643 --> 00:24:26,712
(Enjoying the snowy landscape)

768
00:24:26,713 --> 00:24:28,182
Did you know...

769
00:24:28,183 --> 00:24:29,843
that Yoon Yu Sun graduated from the same department as us?

770
00:24:30,283 --> 00:24:31,653
Yoon Yu Sun?

771
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:33,252
- Which school did you go to? - Didn't you also go...

772
00:24:33,253 --> 00:24:34,253
to Seoul Institute of the Arts?

773
00:24:34,254 --> 00:24:35,352
I did.

774
00:24:35,353 --> 00:24:37,523
The three of us went to the same school.

775
00:24:37,593 --> 00:24:41,493
I didn't know that I went to the same school as Senior Tae Hyun.

776
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,493
Why are you calling me senior all of a sudden?

777
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:46,332
It's because we're talking about school.

778
00:24:46,333 --> 00:24:48,303
- As we went to the same school... - Why all of a sudden?

779
00:24:48,333 --> 00:24:50,163
The three of us are...

780
00:24:50,973 --> 00:24:53,533
neither actors nor entertainers.

781
00:24:54,173 --> 00:24:57,072
How we identify ourselves is ambiguous.

782
00:24:57,073 --> 00:24:59,513
Our role model is Tae Hyun.

783
00:25:01,143 --> 00:25:03,442
While I was on variety shows in the past,

784
00:25:03,443 --> 00:25:05,612
this is when reality hit me.

785
00:25:05,613 --> 00:25:07,082
I was more often at Entertainment Awards...

786
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:09,782
- than Drama Awards. - Right.

787
00:25:09,783 --> 00:25:10,952
I thought, "Is this right?"

788
00:25:10,953 --> 00:25:12,922
I attend the award ceremony every year.

789
00:25:12,923 --> 00:25:14,622
All three of us felt the same.

790
00:25:14,623 --> 00:25:16,292
I used to think that often.

791
00:25:16,293 --> 00:25:18,633
Yi Kyung once asked me...

792
00:25:18,863 --> 00:25:20,962
if he should continue...

793
00:25:20,963 --> 00:25:22,132
being on variety shows or not.

794
00:25:22,133 --> 00:25:23,133
- Yi Kyung? - Yes.

795
00:25:23,134 --> 00:25:24,502
- I thought about it a lot. - That's common.

796
00:25:24,503 --> 00:25:26,403
It's a concern for many actors.

797
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:28,302
I told Yi Kyung to stop...

798
00:25:28,303 --> 00:25:30,172
- being on variety shows. - Right.

799
00:25:30,173 --> 00:25:31,772
At that time,

800
00:25:31,773 --> 00:25:33,512
I was criticized a lot.

801
00:25:33,513 --> 00:25:35,313
I really hated that.

802
00:25:35,983 --> 00:25:38,982
I've played many roles that were positive.

803
00:25:38,983 --> 00:25:41,753
Many said that it was hard to be absorbed in my character.

804
00:25:42,023 --> 00:25:43,083
And that my acting doesn't change.

805
00:25:44,523 --> 00:25:46,152
Si Eon, people have been saying that to me...

806
00:25:46,153 --> 00:25:47,763
ever since my debut.

807
00:25:48,393 --> 00:25:51,063
They say that my acting is always the same.

808
00:25:51,293 --> 00:25:53,593
Even after 20 years of acting,

809
00:25:54,163 --> 00:25:56,463
when I hear reporters say that to me...

810
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:59,332
I've been acting for 20 years,

811
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,773
and if I'm still successful,

812
00:26:02,473 --> 00:26:04,272
they shouldn't say that to me anymore.

813
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:05,313
That's what I said.

814
00:26:05,443 --> 00:26:07,243
After some time,

815
00:26:07,513 --> 00:26:09,482
I realized that I shouldn't feel that way.

816
00:26:09,483 --> 00:26:13,253
Exactly. Experience is the most important thing for an actor.

817
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,923
Having different experiences can't be bad.

818
00:26:17,083 --> 00:26:18,392
That's a common concern...

819
00:26:18,393 --> 00:26:20,222
for actors who appear on variety shows.

820
00:26:20,223 --> 00:26:21,223
It's an ongoing concern.

821
00:26:21,224 --> 00:26:23,262
It's impossible to make it without thinking about that.

822
00:26:23,263 --> 00:26:24,432
(Tae Hyun hopes that he'll feel lighter about it.)

823
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:25,862
Si Eon, what about now?

824
00:26:25,863 --> 00:26:27,502
- Should I stop? - You're doing a good job.

825
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:30,002
It's fine as long as you enjoy it without getting stressed.

826
00:26:30,003 --> 00:26:31,232
It stressed me out.

827
00:26:31,233 --> 00:26:33,272
- That's a given. - That makes it different.

828
00:26:33,273 --> 00:26:35,203
It stressed me out.

829
00:26:35,273 --> 00:26:37,912
Otherwise, there's no reason not to be on variety shows.

830
00:26:37,913 --> 00:26:40,073
(If not, I had no reason not to be on variety shows.)

831
00:26:41,343 --> 00:26:46,353
(While they chat, they arrive in Yeongju.)

832
00:26:47,683 --> 00:26:48,683
(Team Guys, on the other hand)

833
00:26:48,684 --> 00:26:50,553
We have three minutes.

834
00:26:51,153 --> 00:26:53,393
Why do I feel nervous again?

835
00:26:53,593 --> 00:26:56,593
Let's take each question seriously.

836
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:57,833
That sounds good.

837
00:26:59,763 --> 00:27:01,362
"Mansan House."

838
00:27:01,363 --> 00:27:03,263
They must be still living in that house.

839
00:27:03,503 --> 00:27:04,632
It looks like several hundred years old.

840
00:27:04,633 --> 00:27:06,303
- Welcome. - Hello, sir.

841
00:27:06,403 --> 00:27:07,673
- Hello. - Hello.

842
00:27:07,973 --> 00:27:09,773
Welcome to Chunyang.

843
00:27:10,103 --> 00:27:11,542
We're in Chunyang.

844
00:27:11,543 --> 00:27:13,442
"Chun" means spring, and "yang" means light.

845
00:27:13,443 --> 00:27:14,682
- Pardon? - It means spring...

846
00:27:14,683 --> 00:27:15,742
and light.

847
00:27:15,743 --> 00:27:16,942
It's not Chunhyang from Chunhyangjeon.

848
00:27:16,943 --> 00:27:18,052
Chunyang?

849
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:19,512
Based on its name, it should be warm.

850
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,282
- but it's Korea's coldest place. - Really?

851
00:27:21,283 --> 00:27:23,322
The temperature gets as low as minus 30°C.

852
00:27:23,323 --> 00:27:24,323
I see.

853
00:27:24,823 --> 00:27:26,522
(Due to its low temperature, )

854
00:27:26,523 --> 00:27:29,162
(Chunyang is called Korea's Siberia.)

855
00:27:29,163 --> 00:27:33,262
I see firewood over there.

856
00:27:33,263 --> 00:27:35,162
- Do they still use firewood? - Yes.

857
00:27:35,163 --> 00:27:37,773
They still use firewood to warm up the house.

858
00:27:37,903 --> 00:27:39,473
As you can see,

859
00:27:39,773 --> 00:27:42,642
- there's a long room in the front. - Yes.

860
00:27:42,643 --> 00:27:44,002
- It's haengnangchae. - Right.

861
00:27:44,003 --> 00:27:46,673
Next to haengnangchae, there's a tall gate.

862
00:27:47,273 --> 00:27:48,812
- A wealthy family's house. - A house of a wealthy family...

863
00:27:48,813 --> 00:27:50,212
- Someone of high authority. - or a family with power.

864
00:27:50,213 --> 00:27:51,882
That's what it looks like.

865
00:27:51,883 --> 00:27:56,152
This house was built in 1878 by Kang Yong.

866
00:27:56,153 --> 00:27:58,322
His position would be considered under secretary today.

867
00:27:58,323 --> 00:27:59,892
- That's a high position. - After studying,

868
00:27:59,893 --> 00:28:01,492
he wanted to train younger students.

869
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:03,722
So he came back to the rural area and built this house.

870
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:06,292
Are the current residents in this house...

871
00:28:06,293 --> 00:28:08,102
- related to him? - They're his descendants.

872
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,232
His descendants live here?

873
00:28:09,233 --> 00:28:12,473
As the house was well maintained, people still live inside.

874
00:28:12,873 --> 00:28:14,142
(Impressed)

875
00:28:14,143 --> 00:28:16,302
Shall we take a look inside?

876
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:17,303
- Okay. - That sounds good.

877
00:28:17,304 --> 00:28:18,643
Please excuse us.

878
00:28:18,873 --> 00:28:19,943
My goodness.

879
00:28:20,673 --> 00:28:21,782
- Gosh. - Do you see the view?

880
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,982
- It looks like a painting. - Right?

881
00:28:23,983 --> 00:28:25,183
This scene...

882
00:28:25,713 --> 00:28:26,883
It's wide open.

883
00:28:28,083 --> 00:28:30,653
- Aren't these fake? - These are real.

884
00:28:30,953 --> 00:28:32,953
Doesn't everything including the door look like they're drawn?

885
00:28:33,053 --> 00:28:34,163
Doesn't it look like a painting?

886
00:28:35,193 --> 00:28:38,062
(It looks like an illustration in a history book.)

887
00:28:38,063 --> 00:28:42,062
It has an atmosphere that you'd see in a textbook...

888
00:28:42,063 --> 00:28:43,532
- Right. - or a historical drama.

889
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:44,702
It's like looking into history.

890
00:28:44,703 --> 00:28:45,703
Really?

891
00:28:45,903 --> 00:28:47,303
Please take a look from here.

892
00:28:48,903 --> 00:28:51,512
This is called haengnangchae.

893
00:28:51,513 --> 00:28:52,513
Okay.

894
00:28:53,013 --> 00:28:56,543
Haengnangchae works like a fence for the house.

895
00:28:56,743 --> 00:28:57,752
I see.

896
00:28:57,753 --> 00:28:59,952
What's usually kept inside haengnangchae?

897
00:28:59,953 --> 00:29:02,922
In haengnangchae, servants...

898
00:29:02,923 --> 00:29:04,923
and medical staff lived here.

899
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,392
- That's amazing. - There was also a stable...

900
00:29:06,393 --> 00:29:07,922
among other things.

901
00:29:07,923 --> 00:29:09,793
Between 2 pillars is 1 block.

902
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:12,092
- One, two, three. - That's right.

903
00:29:12,093 --> 00:29:14,433
There are 11 blocks.

904
00:29:14,603 --> 00:29:17,232
This is called fleeing.

905
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:19,302
- Right. - The act of fleeing?

906
00:29:19,303 --> 00:29:20,702
- Why is it called flight? - It's where the word comes from.

907
00:29:20,703 --> 00:29:22,102
- How so? - The building was so long...

908
00:29:22,103 --> 00:29:23,642
that servants were busy moving about.

909
00:29:23,643 --> 00:29:25,372
- They had to run around. - Is that why?

910
00:29:25,373 --> 00:29:27,612
There's a theory that the word "fleeing..."

911
00:29:27,613 --> 00:29:29,683
comes from this structure.

912
00:29:29,913 --> 00:29:31,612
(A piece of history hidden in a familiar word)

913
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:32,613
That's amazing.

914
00:29:32,614 --> 00:29:34,422
Shall we go up...

915
00:29:34,423 --> 00:29:35,683
before I continue explaining?

916
00:29:36,023 --> 00:29:37,452
Be careful with the steps.

917
00:29:37,453 --> 00:29:39,053
It's covered with a lot of snow today.

918
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:40,422
(Carefully)

919
00:29:40,423 --> 00:29:42,523
- Be careful. - You'll need to grab my hand.

920
00:29:42,623 --> 00:29:44,533
Among all of you, he needs to grab my hand.

921
00:29:44,763 --> 00:29:46,233
(Flapping)

922
00:29:46,663 --> 00:29:48,202
It looks like he needs my help.

923
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,602
That could be a solution.

924
00:29:49,603 --> 00:29:51,902
Realistically speaking, it's just the two of us today.

925
00:29:51,903 --> 00:29:52,932
Right.

926
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:54,672
Now, this is sarangchae.

927
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:55,673
- Isn't it sarangchae? - Sarangchae?

928
00:29:55,674 --> 00:29:58,912
It was a place reserved for male guests.

929
00:29:58,913 --> 00:30:00,672
- Right. - Male guests stayed here.

930
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,013
- What about their wives? - Their wives stayed in anchae.

931
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:04,182
Did they stay in separate rooms?

932
00:30:04,183 --> 00:30:05,483
In the past, they stayed in separate rooms.

933
00:30:06,113 --> 00:30:09,382
The father and son stayed here.

934
00:30:09,383 --> 00:30:10,383
I see.

935
00:30:10,384 --> 00:30:11,722
The mother stayed in the master bedroom.

936
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:13,392
The daughter-in-law stayed in the room in front of hers.

937
00:30:13,393 --> 00:30:15,263
(Anchae, a space for the mother and daughter-in-law)

938
00:30:16,123 --> 00:30:17,422
So they couldn't see each other often?

939
00:30:17,423 --> 00:30:19,292
No, but they met secretly.

940
00:30:19,293 --> 00:30:21,362
There was a place where they met secretly.

941
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:22,702
In the past, there was a place...

942
00:30:22,703 --> 00:30:23,903
- called gamak floor. - Really?

943
00:30:24,273 --> 00:30:25,832
- Really? - It's very interesting.

944
00:30:25,833 --> 00:30:26,973
Oh, my.

945
00:30:27,403 --> 00:30:29,572
Here's what's unique about this house.

946
00:30:29,573 --> 00:30:31,112
It has the most signboards...

947
00:30:31,113 --> 00:30:32,372
- I see. - in Korea.

948
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:33,572
- And... - There are many.

949
00:30:33,573 --> 00:30:34,842
You're right. They're everywhere.

950
00:30:34,843 --> 00:30:37,953
(Signboards are hanging everywhere in the study and sarangchae.)

951
00:30:38,683 --> 00:30:40,652
Look over there. You read it from right to left.

952
00:30:40,653 --> 00:30:42,182
"Hanmukcheongyeon."

953
00:30:42,183 --> 00:30:45,192
It means good studies and beautiful relationships.

954
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:47,922
You'll also see "Palsaeseo."

955
00:30:47,923 --> 00:30:49,992
It means that it was written by an eight-year-old.

956
00:30:49,993 --> 00:30:51,033
What?

957
00:30:51,163 --> 00:30:52,292
It was written by an eight-year-old?

958
00:30:52,293 --> 00:30:54,602
The eight-year-old was Prince Imperial Yeong.

959
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:55,862
- Prince Imperial Yeong? - Yes.

960
00:30:55,863 --> 00:30:57,032
The name sounds familiar.

961
00:30:57,033 --> 00:30:59,172
- He was the son of King Gojong. - Right.

962
00:30:59,173 --> 00:31:00,473
- Prince Imperial Yeong. - Prince Imperial Yeong.

963
00:31:00,603 --> 00:31:01,772
I know who that is.

964
00:31:01,773 --> 00:31:04,202
It was written by Prince Imperial Yeong when he was eight.

965
00:31:04,203 --> 00:31:05,313
That's amazing.

966
00:31:06,243 --> 00:31:08,112
"Baekmi" is all the way in the back.

967
00:31:08,113 --> 00:31:09,342
- I see. - We must look at "baekmi."

968
00:31:09,343 --> 00:31:10,883
We need to look at it.

969
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:12,213
- That's... - Please show us.

970
00:31:13,113 --> 00:31:14,323
Please be careful.

971
00:31:14,423 --> 00:31:15,653
That's "mansan."

972
00:31:15,853 --> 00:31:16,853
"Mansan?"

973
00:31:16,854 --> 00:31:18,492
It's the nickname of the person who built this house.

974
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:20,492
It was written by someone famous.

975
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:21,793
It was written...

976
00:31:22,663 --> 00:31:23,723
by Daewongun.

977
00:31:24,063 --> 00:31:25,432
- Heungseon Daewongun? - Heungseon Daewongun.

978
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:27,232
(Written by Heungseon Daewongun)

979
00:31:27,233 --> 00:31:28,533
It was written by Heungseon Daewongun.

980
00:31:28,903 --> 00:31:31,773
He was the one who wrote Kang Yong's name.

981
00:31:32,303 --> 00:31:33,602
- Wait a minute. - Yes?

982
00:31:33,603 --> 00:31:35,802
Did Heungseon Daewongun really write this?

983
00:31:35,803 --> 00:31:36,803
Yes.

984
00:31:36,973 --> 00:31:38,512
(A handwriting of a historic person)

985
00:31:38,513 --> 00:31:39,642
It's by Heungseon Daewongun.

986
00:31:39,643 --> 00:31:42,582
He could have written it here.

987
00:31:42,583 --> 00:31:44,182
He wrote it for him because they knew each other.

988
00:31:44,183 --> 00:31:47,822
The problem is that it's difficult to get here.

989
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:48,852
You're right.

990
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:50,622
This is where Taebaek Mountains...

991
00:31:50,623 --> 00:31:51,992
and Sobaek Mountains divide.

992
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:53,152
How else would he have come here?

993
00:31:53,153 --> 00:31:55,022
He probably rode a horse, took a palanquin,

994
00:31:55,023 --> 00:31:56,262
or walked.

995
00:31:56,263 --> 00:31:59,163
He probably took over 15 days to get here.

996
00:31:59,263 --> 00:32:00,993
Think about it. From here to Seoul...

997
00:32:01,963 --> 00:32:03,303
Who would carry a palanquin?

998
00:32:03,363 --> 00:32:04,432
It's the Baekdudaegan.

999
00:32:04,433 --> 00:32:05,433
It snowed.

1000
00:32:05,434 --> 00:32:07,633
He probably saw a tiger everyday.

1001
00:32:08,273 --> 00:32:09,972
- It's a remote area. - Despite the difficulty,

1002
00:32:09,973 --> 00:32:12,572
he came all the way here and stayed.

1003
00:32:12,573 --> 00:32:14,482
He even wrote calligraphy for him.

1004
00:32:14,483 --> 00:32:16,982
- It shows how... - He must have been a good man.

1005
00:32:16,983 --> 00:32:19,113
Popular he had been.

1006
00:32:19,253 --> 00:32:21,223
He was probably an important influencer back then.

1007
00:32:21,523 --> 00:32:22,882
- Right. - It was written outside.

1008
00:32:22,883 --> 00:32:24,992
The story about Heungseon Daewongun.

1009
00:32:24,993 --> 00:32:26,853
- Right. - That's incredible.

1010
00:32:27,023 --> 00:32:28,992
The anchae is this way.

1011
00:32:28,993 --> 00:32:30,522
- Shall we go down this way? - Sure.

1012
00:32:30,523 --> 00:32:31,833
- Please be careful. - Be careful.

1013
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:34,162
(After passing by the men's space)

1014
00:32:34,163 --> 00:32:36,962
This is the door to anchae.

1015
00:32:36,963 --> 00:32:38,672
(They enter anchae, the women's space.)

1016
00:32:38,673 --> 00:32:40,103
- It's long in the back. - Yes.

1017
00:32:40,903 --> 00:32:42,473
Open the door like this.

1018
00:32:43,673 --> 00:32:45,773
The house is connected.

1019
00:32:46,173 --> 00:32:47,273
I see.

1020
00:32:47,913 --> 00:32:49,013
This is anchae.

1021
00:32:49,783 --> 00:32:51,382
All of them stayed inside. Thank you.

1022
00:32:51,383 --> 00:32:53,612
- This is what it looks like. - Yes.

1023
00:32:53,613 --> 00:32:56,023
- It's in a rectangular shape. - Like this?

1024
00:32:56,253 --> 00:32:57,752
This is the front yard.

1025
00:32:57,753 --> 00:32:59,422
The structure of hanok depends...

1026
00:32:59,423 --> 00:33:01,092
- on the region. - Right.

1027
00:33:01,093 --> 00:33:02,962
It's completely closed in cold regions.

1028
00:33:02,963 --> 00:33:04,432
- There's also L-shape. - Right.

1029
00:33:04,433 --> 00:33:07,093
The structure is open in warm regions.

1030
00:33:07,393 --> 00:33:10,633
In cold regions, the structure of the house is rectangular.

1031
00:33:10,703 --> 00:33:13,773
The buildings are close together in a closed structure.

1032
00:33:14,173 --> 00:33:15,943
It really blocks the wind.

1033
00:33:16,373 --> 00:33:18,843
It gets cold here because of the wind.

1034
00:33:19,273 --> 00:33:21,582
The buildings here are quite close to each other.

1035
00:33:21,583 --> 00:33:22,682
- This is amazing. - Yes.

1036
00:33:22,683 --> 00:33:24,752
(The wisdom of our ancestors)

1037
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:27,082
- The father lived in sarangchae. - Yes.

1038
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,083
- And... - The father and...

1039
00:33:28,084 --> 00:33:29,352
- this is anchae? - Yes.

1040
00:33:29,353 --> 00:33:32,423
Usually, the mother and her daughter-in-law stayed here.

1041
00:33:32,653 --> 00:33:34,462
This is the passage...

1042
00:33:34,463 --> 00:33:36,563
that leads to sarangchae.

1043
00:33:36,893 --> 00:33:38,662
It goes through here.

1044
00:33:38,663 --> 00:33:40,533
It's connected to anchae through a room.

1045
00:33:41,303 --> 00:33:42,762
(When you pass a small room as the passageway)

1046
00:33:42,763 --> 00:33:45,003
- They're connected. - Yes, they are.

1047
00:33:45,333 --> 00:33:46,373
It's warm.

1048
00:33:47,873 --> 00:33:48,973
They're connected like this.

1049
00:33:49,373 --> 00:33:51,042
It's an old house that hasn't changed at all.

1050
00:33:51,043 --> 00:33:52,642
(It's connected to the inside of sarangchae...)

1051
00:33:52,643 --> 00:33:54,113
(where men stayed.)

1052
00:34:03,723 --> 00:34:06,692
(As if the entire yard was mine)

1053
00:34:06,693 --> 00:34:10,793
(They enjoy the perspective of the homeowner.)

1054
00:34:11,863 --> 00:34:12,863
It looks beautiful.

1055
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,133
I agree.

1056
00:34:14,903 --> 00:34:16,733
- Shall we go inside anchae? - Okay.

1057
00:34:17,063 --> 00:34:18,403
This house is interesting.

1058
00:34:20,203 --> 00:34:21,643
Excuse us.

1059
00:34:21,973 --> 00:34:25,572
This is anchae, the owner's space.

1060
00:34:25,573 --> 00:34:26,613
Anchae?

1061
00:34:29,883 --> 00:34:32,412
(The space for ladies of the house)

1062
00:34:32,413 --> 00:34:34,183
- The owner's space. - Anchae?

1063
00:34:34,453 --> 00:34:35,552
- Anchae. - Yes.

1064
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:37,823
- My goodness. - Anchae...

1065
00:34:37,953 --> 00:34:39,253
- Anchae. - This place is amazing.

1066
00:34:40,893 --> 00:34:41,893
(Fascinated)

1067
00:34:41,894 --> 00:34:44,492
The daecheong floor is...

1068
00:34:44,493 --> 00:34:45,962
at the center of the house.

1069
00:34:45,963 --> 00:34:47,762
This space is for the owner of the house.

1070
00:34:47,763 --> 00:34:49,963
Usually, the house guardian deity is served here.

1071
00:34:50,703 --> 00:34:52,272
There are deities in the house.

1072
00:34:52,273 --> 00:34:53,672
- Like in "Along with the Gods?" - House guardian deity.

1073
00:34:53,673 --> 00:34:54,842
- He played the deity... - Played by Ma Dong Seok.

1074
00:34:54,843 --> 00:34:55,872
Ma Dong Seok.

1075
00:34:55,873 --> 00:34:56,973
That's right.

1076
00:34:57,003 --> 00:35:00,272
(There's a house deity protecting the deceased...)

1077
00:35:00,273 --> 00:35:02,043
(who should be in the underworld by now.)

1078
00:35:02,913 --> 00:35:07,353
(Are you that troublesome house guardian deity?)

1079
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:11,493
(The house guardian deity)

1080
00:35:11,823 --> 00:35:14,723
(Seongju Jar, the home of the house guardian deity)

1081
00:35:15,123 --> 00:35:16,262
The house guardian deity is kept here.

1082
00:35:16,263 --> 00:35:18,292
The deity is underneath...

1083
00:35:18,293 --> 00:35:20,863
the ridge of the roof.

1084
00:35:21,363 --> 00:35:23,603
The house guardian deity is kept on this floor.

1085
00:35:24,433 --> 00:35:26,873
As you can see, there's the deity jar.

1086
00:35:27,133 --> 00:35:28,302
Deity jar.

1087
00:35:28,303 --> 00:35:30,372
This is where the house guardian deity is kept.

1088
00:35:30,373 --> 00:35:31,913
(Seongju Jar is on one side of daecheong floor.)

1089
00:35:32,873 --> 00:35:34,242
- It's really big. - Yes.

1090
00:35:34,243 --> 00:35:35,943
(Seongju Jar that's been protecting Mansan House for over 150 years)

1091
00:35:36,643 --> 00:35:38,012
(This place is like a living museum.)

1092
00:35:38,013 --> 00:35:39,652
There are so many things I haven't seen before.

1093
00:35:39,653 --> 00:35:40,683
Right?

1094
00:35:40,953 --> 00:35:43,952
In the past, the mother-in-law lived...

1095
00:35:43,953 --> 00:35:45,522
in the master bedroom.

1096
00:35:45,523 --> 00:35:48,423
The daughter-in-law lived in one of the opposite rooms.

1097
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,393
When the mother-in-law grew old,

1098
00:35:50,693 --> 00:35:53,963
she handed all the rights to her daughter-in-law.

1099
00:35:54,163 --> 00:35:55,503
Then she moved to the room in the back.

1100
00:35:56,003 --> 00:35:57,732
- The back room... - The elder in the back room.

1101
00:35:57,733 --> 00:35:58,972
The elder in the back room.

1102
00:35:58,973 --> 00:36:00,272
- That's so sad. - Why?

1103
00:36:00,273 --> 00:36:01,542
There's a saying, "Are you treating me..."

1104
00:36:01,543 --> 00:36:03,072
- "like the elder in the back room?" - Is that so?

1105
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:07,543
You move to the back of the house once you grow old.

1106
00:36:07,573 --> 00:36:09,913
That's the circle of life.

1107
00:36:10,083 --> 00:36:11,482
That's how a generation goes through a cycle.

1108
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:14,052
Imagine how loud it must've been...

1109
00:36:14,053 --> 00:36:16,283
to have 3 to 5 generations of people living together.

1110
00:36:16,653 --> 00:36:18,922
In order to manage that type of chaos,

1111
00:36:18,923 --> 00:36:20,692
they needed a system that circulated.

1112
00:36:20,693 --> 00:36:22,693
That's the wisdom our ancestors had.

1113
00:36:23,493 --> 00:36:25,092
- Hello. - Hello.

1114
00:36:25,093 --> 00:36:26,193
Hello.

1115
00:36:26,333 --> 00:36:28,363
Thank you for making this long trip.

1116
00:36:28,563 --> 00:36:31,732
Thank you for letting us look around...

1117
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:33,172
your house.

1118
00:36:33,173 --> 00:36:34,502
- Thank you. - We were fascinated...

1119
00:36:34,503 --> 00:36:35,843
by a lot of things.

1120
00:36:36,103 --> 00:36:38,272
We had a great time. I mean that.

1121
00:36:38,273 --> 00:36:39,742
(5th generation of the Mansan Kang family)

1122
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:43,113
How long have you been living here?

1123
00:36:43,313 --> 00:36:46,012
I married into the family in 1976.

1124
00:36:46,013 --> 00:36:47,652
That makes it 49 years.

1125
00:36:47,653 --> 00:36:49,383
- Did you say 49? - I'm in my 49th year.

1126
00:36:50,853 --> 00:36:52,423
Before I got married,

1127
00:36:52,693 --> 00:36:54,923
the entire village fussed over...

1128
00:36:55,193 --> 00:36:57,763
how I was marrying into this wealthy family.

1129
00:36:58,193 --> 00:36:59,633
But all they had was this huge house.

1130
00:37:01,503 --> 00:37:02,662
(The lady of the house has a funny bone.)

1131
00:37:02,663 --> 00:37:05,072
What do you like about the house and...

1132
00:37:05,073 --> 00:37:06,973
- What are the cons? - what do you find uncomfortable?

1133
00:37:07,133 --> 00:37:08,802
It's cool in the summer.

1134
00:37:08,803 --> 00:37:10,272
We don't have any tropical nights.

1135
00:37:10,273 --> 00:37:12,713
A cool breeze comes in if we leave the door open.

1136
00:37:12,973 --> 00:37:14,712
- You have crosswinds. - That's right.

1137
00:37:14,713 --> 00:37:15,842
It's cool in the summer.

1138
00:37:15,843 --> 00:37:17,712
Is it slightly colder in the winter?

1139
00:37:17,713 --> 00:37:19,052
More than "slightly."

1140
00:37:19,053 --> 00:37:20,653
- It's probably freezing. - That's an understatement.

1141
00:37:20,713 --> 00:37:22,282
I can't wipe the floors.

1142
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:23,722
- Because it's that cold? - We have a strong draft...

1143
00:37:23,723 --> 00:37:25,153
in the winter.

1144
00:37:25,693 --> 00:37:27,752
We tried to add more insulation,

1145
00:37:27,753 --> 00:37:29,722
but the doors are so old...

1146
00:37:29,723 --> 00:37:32,092
- Of course. - that they have gaps.

1147
00:37:32,093 --> 00:37:33,093
But since this is a state-designated...

1148
00:37:33,094 --> 00:37:34,132
- cultural property, - That's right.

1149
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:35,762
We can't change its layout.

1150
00:37:35,763 --> 00:37:38,102
I can't do anything to the house that I want.

1151
00:37:38,103 --> 00:37:39,133
(They can't change the details about the house.)

1152
00:37:39,873 --> 00:37:43,203
But since it's home, it doesn't affect you as much.

1153
00:37:44,503 --> 00:37:46,442
(The old house that's been here of 150 years)

1154
00:37:46,443 --> 00:37:50,142
I'm proud as a descendant to know that this house...

1155
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,353
has a significant meaning as a museum.

1156
00:37:53,883 --> 00:37:55,682
Our daughters and sons-in-law love this place.

1157
00:37:55,683 --> 00:37:58,192
The children are here, and they love it here too.

1158
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,522
The same goes for our daughter-in-law.

1159
00:37:59,523 --> 00:38:01,393
They don't think about leaving.

1160
00:38:02,423 --> 00:38:04,222
(Memories of yesterday and today will be stacked...)

1161
00:38:04,223 --> 00:38:06,993
(to be the future of Mansan House.)

1162
00:38:07,863 --> 00:38:10,732
(Time for Quiz)

1163
00:38:10,733 --> 00:38:11,833
Please.

1164
00:38:12,103 --> 00:38:14,702
We're the weaker team.

1165
00:38:14,703 --> 00:38:16,273
But we'll overcome this.

1166
00:38:16,703 --> 00:38:17,742
If you answer correctly,

1167
00:38:17,743 --> 00:38:19,172
you'll have stone pot rice with pine mushrooms for lunch.

1168
00:38:19,173 --> 00:38:20,173
(The prize will be stone pot rice with pine mushrooms.)

1169
00:38:20,174 --> 00:38:21,612
- It'll warm you up. - I want that!

1170
00:38:21,613 --> 00:38:23,483
Wild pine mushrooms!

1171
00:38:23,543 --> 00:38:25,113
- Okay. Bring the mushrooms. - All right.

1172
00:38:25,453 --> 00:38:26,583
Here you go.

1173
00:38:26,753 --> 00:38:28,783
When you first entered the house,

1174
00:38:29,023 --> 00:38:30,652
you walked through...

1175
00:38:30,653 --> 00:38:33,193
- the tall gate. - Right.

1176
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:34,963
A tall gate like this...

1177
00:38:34,993 --> 00:38:36,663
was only allowed...

1178
00:38:36,793 --> 00:38:39,462
in homes of noblemen who ranked...

1179
00:38:39,463 --> 00:38:40,892
- above Third Senior. - Right.

1180
00:38:40,893 --> 00:38:44,433
The height of this front gate symbolized power and authority,

1181
00:38:45,873 --> 00:38:48,503
but this is also the reason why it was built so tall.

1182
00:38:48,803 --> 00:38:50,003
What was that reason?

1183
00:38:51,473 --> 00:38:52,613
What was that reason?

1184
00:38:52,643 --> 00:38:54,443
To be stylish.

1185
00:38:54,913 --> 00:38:56,443
There would be so many reasons.

1186
00:38:56,483 --> 00:38:58,182
- You're not wrong. - Right.

1187
00:38:58,183 --> 00:38:59,252
That's true.

1188
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,852
Can I at least ask this?

1189
00:39:00,853 --> 00:39:02,082
In Korean, it's soseuldaemun.

1190
00:39:02,083 --> 00:39:03,352
- In Chinese characters? - Does it mean "to tower above?"

1191
00:39:03,353 --> 00:39:04,893
- Is that what it means? - Yes.

1192
00:39:04,923 --> 00:39:06,523
- Is there a particular reason? - Wait!

1193
00:39:07,523 --> 00:39:09,762
- I know what it is. - Yes, there's a particular reason.

1194
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:10,923
Could it be something simple?

1195
00:39:10,963 --> 00:39:12,292
- Do you know the answer? - I think so.

1196
00:39:12,293 --> 00:39:14,062
- Please. - Jae Hyeon knows for sure.

1197
00:39:14,063 --> 00:39:15,133
Really?

1198
00:39:15,164 --> 00:39:16,964
- I know what it is. - Yes, there's a particular reason.

1199
00:39:18,234 --> 00:39:19,533
- Do you know the answer? - I think so.

1200
00:39:19,534 --> 00:39:21,373
- Please. - Jae Hyeon knows for sure.

1201
00:39:21,374 --> 00:39:23,133
Really? How?

1202
00:39:23,134 --> 00:39:25,673
Walk us through the thought process.

1203
00:39:25,674 --> 00:39:26,703
- Here... - Is it just a feeling?

1204
00:39:26,704 --> 00:39:29,714
As you know, this is a room as well.

1205
00:39:29,774 --> 00:39:32,714
People stayed here including the servants.

1206
00:39:33,014 --> 00:39:35,013
It was to raise the ceiling...

1207
00:39:35,014 --> 00:39:36,454
so that it could feel spacious.

1208
00:39:37,014 --> 00:39:39,824
(This is the front gate, not a room.)

1209
00:39:40,524 --> 00:39:41,624
Am I wrong?

1210
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:43,623
Or maybe not.

1211
00:39:43,624 --> 00:39:45,363
It's up to us today.

1212
00:39:45,364 --> 00:39:47,893
- It's on us. - I guess not.

1213
00:39:47,894 --> 00:39:49,334
It's up to us to save Jae Hyeon.

1214
00:39:49,594 --> 00:39:50,834
You know that.

1215
00:39:50,894 --> 00:39:52,133
This is Saving Private Jae Hyeon.

1216
00:39:52,134 --> 00:39:53,934
Saving Private Jae Hyeon.

1217
00:39:54,004 --> 00:39:55,234
If we lose,

1218
00:39:55,334 --> 00:39:56,803
I think it'll be him going to the cucumber farm.

1219
00:39:56,804 --> 00:39:58,203
That's why we need to save him.

1220
00:39:58,204 --> 00:40:00,774
(He can't refute.)

1221
00:40:01,356 --> 00:40:02,555
Why don't I guess the answer?

1222
00:40:02,556 --> 00:40:04,086
- Go ahead. - Here's what I think.

1223
00:40:04,416 --> 00:40:06,956
This was a family of power and authority.

1224
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:09,156
They have a lot of money and assets.

1225
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:10,626
Because of that,

1226
00:40:10,896 --> 00:40:13,325
they brought things into the house that other families couldn't have.

1227
00:40:13,326 --> 00:40:14,566
Cows for instance.

1228
00:40:14,626 --> 00:40:16,065
- Or maybe... - Horses.

1229
00:40:16,066 --> 00:40:18,665
- Horses and also palanquins. - They rode both.

1230
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,905
- We're on the same page. - Right?

1231
00:40:20,906 --> 00:40:22,475
Those things needed to come through the door.

1232
00:40:22,476 --> 00:40:24,405
This is what I think.

1233
00:40:24,406 --> 00:40:25,505
(It came to me!)

1234
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,645
This is what I think.

1235
00:40:27,646 --> 00:40:28,776
Go ahead.

1236
00:40:29,916 --> 00:40:32,945
It just struck me.

1237
00:40:32,946 --> 00:40:34,685
- I got it. - When Dong Hyun...

1238
00:40:34,686 --> 00:40:35,985
- gets like this, - Well...

1239
00:40:35,986 --> 00:40:38,525
something is bound to happen.

1240
00:40:38,526 --> 00:40:41,086
Sometimes, it just hits me.

1241
00:40:41,156 --> 00:40:42,956
This is something that came to mind.

1242
00:40:43,056 --> 00:40:45,625
Noblemen and those of power...

1243
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:47,066
I got it too!

1244
00:40:47,166 --> 00:40:48,395
Then do this.

1245
00:40:48,396 --> 00:40:49,896
- This! - I got it!

1246
00:40:50,596 --> 00:40:51,605
(Fussing over the hunch they have)

1247
00:40:51,606 --> 00:40:52,865
It struck me.

1248
00:40:52,866 --> 00:40:54,465
There's one particular reason.

1249
00:40:54,466 --> 00:40:56,305
- I know what it is. - What is it?

1250
00:40:56,306 --> 00:40:57,376
Ranking first in the state exam.

1251
00:40:57,936 --> 00:41:00,305
- What? - They arrive in palanquins.

1252
00:41:00,306 --> 00:41:01,645
Isn't that why they needed a tall gate?

1253
00:41:01,646 --> 00:41:03,615
It's up to us. We're by ourselves today.

1254
00:41:03,616 --> 00:41:05,245
- It's just us. You hear me? - Got it.

1255
00:41:05,246 --> 00:41:07,885
He's not entirely wrong. I think it's the palanquin.

1256
00:41:07,886 --> 00:41:09,386
- I... - One would fit.

1257
00:41:10,016 --> 00:41:11,926
I also think it's the palanquin. Why don't we...

1258
00:41:12,126 --> 00:41:13,655
- Sit here. - Like that?

1259
00:41:13,656 --> 00:41:15,696
- You're the lightest. - It should be you.

1260
00:41:15,796 --> 00:41:17,525
- That's right. - Do it.

1261
00:41:17,526 --> 00:41:19,165
- My gosh! - It's a perfect fit.

1262
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:21,225
- It's perfect. - Right?

1263
00:41:21,226 --> 00:41:24,165
- It was for the palanquin. - Come hither!

1264
00:41:24,166 --> 00:41:25,765
- It's perfect. - The palanquin is the reason.

1265
00:41:25,766 --> 00:41:27,405
- It's the palanquin. - It's a perfect fit.

1266
00:41:27,406 --> 00:41:29,105
Seung Ho can decide. I think it's a palanquin.

1267
00:41:29,106 --> 00:41:30,806
- Seung Ho can decide. - I'm good with anything.

1268
00:41:30,836 --> 00:41:33,376
We're all on the same page.

1269
00:41:33,576 --> 00:41:37,245
Is there something else that could be the answer?

1270
00:41:37,246 --> 00:41:38,345
- You want to be sure. - Right.

1271
00:41:38,346 --> 00:41:40,615
The long thing worn by royal inspectors.

1272
00:41:40,616 --> 00:41:42,256
- Yes? - It's really long.

1273
00:41:42,986 --> 00:41:44,885
- We need to stay sharp. - Why?

1274
00:41:44,886 --> 00:41:46,325
- It's up to us. - It's long.

1275
00:41:46,326 --> 00:41:47,925
People don't know this,

1276
00:41:47,926 --> 00:41:49,525
but you would having been in period dramas.

1277
00:41:49,526 --> 00:41:50,825
- Horses... - They're big.

1278
00:41:50,826 --> 00:41:52,195
They're huge.

1279
00:41:52,196 --> 00:41:53,865
They're way taller than cows.

1280
00:41:53,866 --> 00:41:56,335
- Up to here. - To go through riding horses?

1281
00:41:56,336 --> 00:41:58,906
- We need a more generic answer. - Sure.

1282
00:41:59,206 --> 00:42:01,366
- But... - It's like this.

1283
00:42:02,506 --> 00:42:03,875
For...

1284
00:42:03,876 --> 00:42:05,445
(The answer)

1285
00:42:05,446 --> 00:42:07,405
For taller things to get through the gate.

1286
00:42:07,406 --> 00:42:08,446
That's it.

1287
00:42:09,176 --> 00:42:10,975
(Slightly embarrassed)

1288
00:42:10,976 --> 00:42:13,585
It can't get more precise than that.

1289
00:42:13,586 --> 00:42:16,456
Of course. But that's all I can think of.

1290
00:42:17,186 --> 00:42:18,255
What now?

1291
00:42:18,256 --> 00:42:20,155
(I got it!)

1292
00:42:20,156 --> 00:42:21,756
- It's nothing. - It's tall because...

1293
00:42:22,626 --> 00:42:23,796
- What now? - Is there something over there?

1294
00:42:25,566 --> 00:42:27,525
- What now? - Didn't those of higher rank...

1295
00:42:27,526 --> 00:42:28,996
have higher hats?

1296
00:42:29,036 --> 00:42:30,135
But that tall?

1297
00:42:30,136 --> 00:42:31,136
(Can hats be that tall?)

1298
00:42:31,137 --> 00:42:33,566
I guess that's a possibility.

1299
00:42:35,376 --> 00:42:37,306
One could've been like this.

1300
00:42:37,336 --> 00:42:38,346
Hold on.

1301
00:42:38,376 --> 00:42:39,376
This was possible.

1302
00:42:39,377 --> 00:42:42,146
What's that? What could be that tall?

1303
00:42:42,546 --> 00:42:44,746
- That actually makes sense. - It's possible.

1304
00:42:45,316 --> 00:42:47,515
It's like this.

1305
00:42:47,516 --> 00:42:49,986
- Like this. - Noblemen of high rank...

1306
00:42:50,156 --> 00:42:52,455
wouldn't enter the house by dropping the chin.

1307
00:42:52,456 --> 00:42:54,155
- Exactly. - That would be wrong.

1308
00:42:54,156 --> 00:42:55,895
- It's to walk through it with ease. - Right.

1309
00:42:55,896 --> 00:42:57,825
They had to walk like this.

1310
00:42:57,826 --> 00:42:59,565
It's one of the two for me.

1311
00:42:59,566 --> 00:43:00,965
Can I answer the question?

1312
00:43:00,966 --> 00:43:02,035
Yes, go ahead.

1313
00:43:02,036 --> 00:43:03,595
- Are you sure? - Say you want to answer.

1314
00:43:03,596 --> 00:43:06,365
I'll answer the question.

1315
00:43:06,366 --> 00:43:08,306
- Yes, let us answer. - Sure.

1316
00:43:09,106 --> 00:43:14,276
So that it wouldn't be uncomfortable to enter the house...

1317
00:43:14,576 --> 00:43:18,485
on horses or in palanquins that were tall.

1318
00:43:18,486 --> 00:43:19,585
(My gosh)

1319
00:43:19,586 --> 00:43:20,586
That's the perfect answer.

1320
00:43:21,886 --> 00:43:24,655
When on horses or in palanquins...

1321
00:43:24,656 --> 00:43:26,555
Or anything else that was tall.

1322
00:43:26,556 --> 00:43:28,426
To enter the house on something elevated.

1323
00:43:28,996 --> 00:43:30,595
The noblemen.

1324
00:43:30,596 --> 00:43:31,765
Please, we need to get this right.

1325
00:43:31,766 --> 00:43:33,365
- We... - Hold on. We're not done,

1326
00:43:33,366 --> 00:43:34,526
so let me add onto that.

1327
00:43:34,696 --> 00:43:38,096
At the time, noblemen...

1328
00:43:38,366 --> 00:43:40,766
would rarely drop their chins.

1329
00:43:41,676 --> 00:43:43,275
In that sense,

1330
00:43:43,276 --> 00:43:45,075
they stayed on their horses...

1331
00:43:45,076 --> 00:43:46,745
and in their palanquins...

1332
00:43:46,746 --> 00:43:49,015
to enter the house.

1333
00:43:49,016 --> 00:43:50,675
- My heart's aching. - That's why the gate is tall.

1334
00:43:50,676 --> 00:43:51,785
(So that noblemen could enter the house in an elevated state)

1335
00:43:51,786 --> 00:43:54,046
- There. - The answer you gave me...

1336
00:43:54,416 --> 00:43:56,186
It was a long one.

1337
00:43:57,656 --> 00:44:00,555
You answered that it was for noblemen...

1338
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:02,655
to enter the house on horses or in palanquins...

1339
00:44:02,656 --> 00:44:04,726
without dropping their chins.

1340
00:44:05,026 --> 00:44:06,895
Kang "Mansan" Yong...

1341
00:44:06,896 --> 00:44:10,195
had a relationship with Heungseon Daewongun.

1342
00:44:10,196 --> 00:44:12,765
Noblemen of high rank...

1343
00:44:12,766 --> 00:44:14,535
- For when they visit. - This is...

1344
00:44:14,536 --> 00:44:17,006
the kind of gate they'd go through.

1345
00:44:17,036 --> 00:44:19,105
- They shouldn't lower their heads. - No way.

1346
00:44:19,106 --> 00:44:20,275
That can't happen.

1347
00:44:20,276 --> 00:44:22,016
And they'd be on horses or in palanquins.

1348
00:44:23,046 --> 00:44:24,046
That's why.
- Right. - You are correct.

1349
00:44:25,047 --> 00:44:26,185
(The answer is correct.)

1350
00:44:26,186 --> 00:44:27,686
- We did it. - No way.

1351
00:44:27,716 --> 00:44:29,985
- My gosh. Hold on. - Really?

1352
00:44:29,986 --> 00:44:31,615
- What's the exact answer? - What's the answer?

1353
00:44:31,616 --> 00:44:32,625
- Really? - What's the exact answer?

1354
00:44:32,626 --> 00:44:34,526
- Here's the exact answer. - Sure.

1355
00:44:34,926 --> 00:44:38,255
So that noblemen didn't have to lower their heads...

1356
00:44:38,256 --> 00:44:40,495
when going through the gate on horses or in palanquins.

1357
00:44:40,496 --> 00:44:42,695
- That's the answer. - You gave the exact answer.

1358
00:44:42,696 --> 00:44:44,565
The three of us got it together.

1359
00:44:44,566 --> 00:44:46,465
- You're right. - Hold on. We got the rides...

1360
00:44:46,466 --> 00:44:47,935
- and the lowering of the head. - Right.

1361
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:49,105
We gave you the exact answer.

1362
00:44:49,106 --> 00:44:50,305
It was right on the nose.

1363
00:44:50,306 --> 00:44:51,575
(Team Guys got the exact answer.)

1364
00:44:51,576 --> 00:44:52,606
No way.

1365
00:44:53,076 --> 00:44:54,405
That victorious energy.

1366
00:44:54,406 --> 00:44:57,176
That's the taste of victory. Are you kidding me?

1367
00:44:57,416 --> 00:44:59,885
Let's win the race today and see the two smart ones...

1368
00:44:59,886 --> 00:45:01,315
battle it out.

1369
00:45:01,316 --> 00:45:02,616
To be honest,

1370
00:45:02,686 --> 00:45:03,916
I don't think they're the smartest.

1371
00:45:04,016 --> 00:45:05,455
Yes. We are the aces.

1372
00:45:05,456 --> 00:45:06,755
- We are the aces. - Yes.

1373
00:45:06,756 --> 00:45:07,956
My heart hurts.

1374
00:45:08,186 --> 00:45:10,056
- The tall gate. - The tall gate.

1375
00:45:10,626 --> 00:45:13,926
(Team Guys occupies the first spot, Bonghwa.)

1376
00:45:14,226 --> 00:45:18,266
(The endless high mountains of North Gyeongsang Province)

1377
00:45:19,706 --> 00:45:23,776
(That's why it has been a home of lumber for a long time.)

1378
00:45:24,336 --> 00:45:26,975
(Team Handsome)

1379
00:45:26,976 --> 00:45:28,245
We're almost there.

1380
00:45:28,246 --> 00:45:29,246
(We're almost there.)

1381
00:45:30,176 --> 00:45:32,586
We've come to a place unlike Bonghwa in Bonghwa.

1382
00:45:34,216 --> 00:45:35,585
We're in Yeongju, Si Eon.

1383
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:37,656
- Is this Si Eon? - We've come that far.

1384
00:45:38,426 --> 00:45:39,455
It looks far away,

1385
00:45:39,456 --> 00:45:41,485
but you reach there in no time while talking to one another.

1386
00:45:41,486 --> 00:45:42,496
(They left Bonghwa and arrived in Yeongju.)

1387
00:45:43,056 --> 00:45:46,126
(Looking around, confused)

1388
00:45:46,426 --> 00:45:49,195
It's not a place for a five-story building.

1389
00:45:49,196 --> 00:45:50,436
This is an empty lot. Wait a second.

1390
00:45:50,596 --> 00:45:52,306
- Is there an architecture? - Architecture?

1391
00:45:52,436 --> 00:45:53,665
It's a random place for an architecture to be here.

1392
00:45:53,666 --> 00:45:54,865
Are we going to go and see an apartment?

1393
00:45:54,866 --> 00:45:57,136
(Looking around an apartment all of a sudden?)

1394
00:45:57,506 --> 00:45:58,705
(What on earth is this place?)

1395
00:45:58,706 --> 00:46:00,276
- Hello. - Come this way.,

1396
00:46:00,806 --> 00:46:02,715
(Mrs. Roh has arrived first to welcome Team Handsome.)

1397
00:46:02,716 --> 00:46:03,876
But, ma'am...

1398
00:46:04,376 --> 00:46:06,086
We can see such a building in Seoul too.

1399
00:46:07,016 --> 00:46:08,715
- It doesn't exist in Seoul. - There's nothing like it in Seoul.

1400
00:46:08,716 --> 00:46:09,716
- No? - No.

1401
00:46:09,717 --> 00:46:12,285
This is the tallest wooden apartment...

1402
00:46:12,286 --> 00:46:14,785
in Korea. It's a five-story building.

1403
00:46:14,786 --> 00:46:16,756
A wooden apartment?

1404
00:46:17,656 --> 00:46:19,225
(A brown building among the concrete buildings...)

1405
00:46:19,226 --> 00:46:20,796
(catches your eye.)

1406
00:46:21,596 --> 00:46:24,435
(It looks like wooden blocks.)

1407
00:46:24,436 --> 00:46:25,465
(Hangreen Wooden Building)

1408
00:46:25,466 --> 00:46:27,206
(This place is...)

1409
00:46:27,606 --> 00:46:32,146
(Handsome Heritage 2: An apartment made of wood)

1410
00:46:32,246 --> 00:46:34,845
It was built in 2019.

1411
00:46:34,846 --> 00:46:37,445
It was selected as 1 of the 14 most beautiful wooden buildings...

1412
00:46:37,446 --> 00:46:38,915
- in the world. - Really?

1413
00:46:38,916 --> 00:46:41,115
- It's very famous. - But when we just look at it,

1414
00:46:41,116 --> 00:46:43,055
it doesn't look that special. We just think it's a building.

1415
00:46:43,056 --> 00:46:44,056
Who would have thought?

1416
00:46:44,057 --> 00:46:46,225
- The outside is wood only, - Exactly.

1417
00:46:46,226 --> 00:46:48,655
But the inside might be built with cement or steel bars.

1418
00:46:48,656 --> 00:46:49,656
Is it wood inside too?

1419
00:46:49,657 --> 00:46:50,755
Everything is made of wood.

1420
00:46:50,756 --> 00:46:53,065
The pillars, walls, and everything are made of wood.

1421
00:46:53,066 --> 00:46:56,465
The space for the elevator is made of concrete, though.

1422
00:46:56,466 --> 00:46:58,565
That part that looks like cement is wood too?

1423
00:46:58,566 --> 00:46:59,666
Yes. It's all wood.

1424
00:47:00,606 --> 00:47:03,335
Its height is 19.1m.

1425
00:47:03,336 --> 00:47:06,406
There was no wooden building that was higher than 18m.

1426
00:47:06,446 --> 00:47:08,675
- Do people live in there? - Yes. This place...

1427
00:47:08,676 --> 00:47:10,375
was built by the Korea Forest Service...

1428
00:47:10,376 --> 00:47:13,215
to find out if it's possible to build a wooden apartment.

1429
00:47:13,216 --> 00:47:14,515
While studying it,

1430
00:47:14,516 --> 00:47:16,456
the researchers are living in it.

1431
00:47:16,486 --> 00:47:18,155
Only the researchers can live here.

1432
00:47:18,156 --> 00:47:19,525
While living here,

1433
00:47:19,526 --> 00:47:21,226
they experiment its living condition right now.

1434
00:47:21,356 --> 00:47:22,525
By the way,

1435
00:47:22,526 --> 00:47:24,895
- when the recent LA wildfires... - Right.

1436
00:47:24,896 --> 00:47:26,095
Burned down many homes,

1437
00:47:26,096 --> 00:47:28,125
people said we should build them with concrete again.

1438
00:47:28,126 --> 00:47:29,665
That was what people said,

1439
00:47:29,666 --> 00:47:31,196
and it's the case of this building too.

1440
00:47:31,266 --> 00:47:33,805
When we say earthquake-proof,

1441
00:47:33,806 --> 00:47:35,805
it doesn't mean a building won't collapse...

1442
00:47:35,806 --> 00:47:37,606
- during an earthquake. - I see.

1443
00:47:37,636 --> 00:47:39,045
It means whether one can escape the building...

1444
00:47:39,046 --> 00:47:40,675
within one hour when there's an earthquake.

1445
00:47:40,676 --> 00:47:41,915
(A seismic design is for a building to hold 1 hour before collapsing.)

1446
00:47:41,916 --> 00:47:43,575
- That's what it is. - It's the same with fireproofing.

1447
00:47:43,576 --> 00:47:44,675
When there's a fire,

1448
00:47:44,676 --> 00:47:47,185
can one escape the building on 1 or 2 hours?

1449
00:47:47,186 --> 00:47:48,215
Can they escape the building?

1450
00:47:48,216 --> 00:47:49,585
- That's the key. - Will they hold it?

1451
00:47:49,586 --> 00:47:51,515
As for this building,

1452
00:47:51,516 --> 00:47:53,986
it satisfied the fireproof standard to hold two hours.

1453
00:47:55,326 --> 00:47:57,925
(With endless research, )

1454
00:47:57,926 --> 00:48:01,726
(they are developing timber that endures fire very well.)

1455
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,335
- I see. - So this place...

1456
00:48:04,336 --> 00:48:05,665
It's a residential building over there.

1457
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:07,535
We can't go inside...

1458
00:48:07,536 --> 00:48:08,775
- because people are living in it. - We can't see that.

1459
00:48:08,776 --> 00:48:09,975
But we can go inside here.

1460
00:48:09,976 --> 00:48:11,106
- I see. - Let's go inside.

1461
00:48:11,876 --> 00:48:14,546
(It's time to look at the inside.)

1462
00:48:18,476 --> 00:48:22,586
(It's a sunlit open space with a high ceiling.)

1463
00:48:23,386 --> 00:48:24,655
Is this a nursery?

1464
00:48:24,656 --> 00:48:25,855
Yes. It's a care center.

1465
00:48:25,856 --> 00:48:27,855
They look after the children after school.

1466
00:48:27,856 --> 00:48:29,255
They can come...

1467
00:48:29,256 --> 00:48:30,625
- if they live in the neighbourhood. - I guess so?

1468
00:48:30,626 --> 00:48:31,795
It's nice.

1469
00:48:31,796 --> 00:48:34,366
(Even though it's made of wood, it is big and spacious.)

1470
00:48:34,596 --> 00:48:36,696
Now that we've heard your explanation,

1471
00:48:36,996 --> 00:48:39,305
except for the bolts and nuts,

1472
00:48:39,306 --> 00:48:41,035
everything is made of wood.

1473
00:48:41,036 --> 00:48:42,935
Yes. And the pillars are really big.

1474
00:48:42,936 --> 00:48:45,506
They used the material called CLT.

1475
00:48:45,606 --> 00:48:49,315
With the same material, they built the wall and columns.

1476
00:48:49,316 --> 00:48:51,745
Even the ceiling is made of the same material.

1477
00:48:51,746 --> 00:48:54,616
They joined it together like a puzzle.

1478
00:48:54,686 --> 00:48:56,385
This building is significant.

1479
00:48:56,386 --> 00:48:57,585
Since Korea Forest Service built it,

1480
00:48:57,586 --> 00:48:59,655
it used timber from Korea.

1481
00:48:59,656 --> 00:49:03,126
Other wooden houses are made of imported timber.

1482
00:49:03,256 --> 00:49:06,166
So, they're researching it over there.

1483
00:49:06,266 --> 00:49:08,295
- They're still doing it, right? - That's right.

1484
00:49:08,296 --> 00:49:09,595
Is there less noise...

1485
00:49:09,596 --> 00:49:10,695
between the floors?

1486
00:49:10,696 --> 00:49:11,735
That's a sensitive issue.

1487
00:49:11,736 --> 00:49:13,535
Here's the problem. The wood is...

1488
00:49:13,536 --> 00:49:15,875
- As you can see, it's spring, - Yes.

1489
00:49:15,876 --> 00:49:17,775
But it snowed and all because it's been cold.

1490
00:49:17,776 --> 00:49:19,305
The problem with the wood is...

1491
00:49:19,306 --> 00:49:20,505
no matter how it was well processed,

1492
00:49:20,506 --> 00:49:22,145
we have to wait...

1493
00:49:22,146 --> 00:49:23,745
until it finishes contracting and expanding.

1494
00:49:23,746 --> 00:49:26,915
Until we have the result of that study,

1495
00:49:26,916 --> 00:49:29,855
- we have to wait. That's an issue. - It requires time.

1496
00:49:29,856 --> 00:49:32,056
- The Buseoksa Temple is nearby. - Yes.

1497
00:49:32,156 --> 00:49:33,655
The Muryangsujeon Hall of Buseoksa Temple, Yeongju...

1498
00:49:33,656 --> 00:49:35,126
is standing 1,000 years without problem.

1499
00:49:35,296 --> 00:49:36,525
Like that building...

1500
00:49:36,526 --> 00:49:37,995
Will it take 1,000 years...

1501
00:49:37,996 --> 00:49:39,466
- to be stabilized? - No. That's not it.

1502
00:49:39,726 --> 00:49:40,995
We'll die before we find out...

1503
00:49:40,996 --> 00:49:42,635
- about the noise issue. - You can wait another ten years.

1504
00:49:42,636 --> 00:49:45,506
Will there be noise between floors after 1,000 years?

1505
00:49:45,666 --> 00:49:50,636
(While they're at it, they go up to the 2nd floor.)

1506
00:49:53,546 --> 00:49:55,715
Gosh. I can smell the wood very well.

1507
00:49:55,716 --> 00:49:57,116
The smell of the wood is nice.

1508
00:49:57,476 --> 00:49:59,486
It's fantastic.

1509
00:50:00,786 --> 00:50:02,055
Gosh. Look.

1510
00:50:02,056 --> 00:50:04,316
(Steaking his head out)

1511
00:50:05,216 --> 00:50:07,725
(It demonstrates various designs using timber.)

1512
00:50:07,726 --> 00:50:09,725
Gosh. This is nice.

1513
00:50:09,726 --> 00:50:11,695
It's perfectly assembled.

1514
00:50:11,696 --> 00:50:12,726
It's pretty.

1515
00:50:13,026 --> 00:50:16,096
They have been studying it for a long time.

1516
00:50:16,196 --> 00:50:17,495
Maybe they're already done with it,

1517
00:50:17,496 --> 00:50:20,335
but they're doing it for a long time because they want to stay here.

1518
00:50:20,336 --> 00:50:21,735
- Releasing one paper a year. - That's possible.

1519
00:50:21,736 --> 00:50:23,905
They're actually already done with the study.

1520
00:50:23,906 --> 00:50:25,605
- But it's so nice to live here. - They have to leave.

1521
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:26,775
So, they say, they need more to study.

1522
00:50:26,776 --> 00:50:28,546
Based on what I saw, the study is complete.

1523
00:50:29,016 --> 00:50:30,915
(Time for Quiz)

1524
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:32,045
If you get the quiz right,

1525
00:50:32,046 --> 00:50:34,845
we'll provide you with a meal with bulgogi.

1526
00:50:34,846 --> 00:50:35,956
I love it.

1527
00:50:36,186 --> 00:50:37,916
- I'm confident. - Okay.

1528
00:50:38,756 --> 00:50:41,526
- We all went to the same school. - That's right.

1529
00:50:41,686 --> 00:50:43,425
If we get this wrong,

1530
00:50:43,426 --> 00:50:45,096
- it's a disgrace to the school. - It's a disgrace to the school.

1531
00:50:45,996 --> 00:50:48,296
We didn't take the CSAT.

1532
00:50:48,326 --> 00:50:49,835
We only took the performance test.

1533
00:50:49,836 --> 00:50:51,136
On Seoul Institute of the Arts' honour!

1534
00:50:51,936 --> 00:50:53,406
- Here's the quiz. - Okay.

1535
00:50:53,766 --> 00:50:58,135
Hangreen wooden building is a building made mainly of wood.

1536
00:50:58,136 --> 00:50:59,346
Now,

1537
00:51:00,006 --> 00:51:01,306
of the following trees,

1538
00:51:01,546 --> 00:51:05,276
- which one doesn't exist? - Really?

1539
00:51:05,346 --> 00:51:06,916
- Here are the examples. - Okay.

1540
00:51:06,946 --> 00:51:08,016
Number One,

1541
00:51:08,616 --> 00:51:09,755
a gogi tree.

1542
00:51:09,756 --> 00:51:11,285
(Which tree doesn't exist? 1. Gogi tree)

1543
00:51:11,286 --> 00:51:12,585
Number Two,

1544
00:51:12,586 --> 00:51:13,786
a guksu tree.

1545
00:51:14,026 --> 00:51:15,455
- Darn it. - The guksu tree exists.

1546
00:51:15,456 --> 00:51:16,726
- Number Three, - Do you know that?

1547
00:51:17,326 --> 00:51:18,656
A kkwangkkwang tree.

1548
00:51:19,166 --> 00:51:20,595
I don't know about the kkwangkkwang tree.

1549
00:51:20,596 --> 00:51:21,665
Number Four,

1550
00:51:21,666 --> 00:51:23,096
an ahwae tree.

1551
00:51:23,866 --> 00:51:25,635
Gosh. For goodness' sake.

1552
00:51:25,636 --> 00:51:27,766
(2. Guksu tree, 3. Kkwangkkwang tree, 4. Ahwae tree)

1553
00:51:28,006 --> 00:51:29,135
A kkwangkkwang tree?

1554
00:51:29,136 --> 00:51:30,475
A kkwangkkwang tree. An ahwae tree?

1555
00:51:30,476 --> 00:51:31,706
It's not going to work, right?

1556
00:51:31,876 --> 00:51:32,876
Hold on, Si Eon.

1557
00:51:32,877 --> 00:51:35,205
You said you were sure that the guksu tree existed.

1558
00:51:35,206 --> 00:51:36,915
(Are you sure about it?)

1559
00:51:36,916 --> 00:51:38,346
- If I remember correctly, - Yes.

1560
00:51:38,446 --> 00:51:40,386
- there are two trees I remember. - What are they?

1561
00:51:40,516 --> 00:51:41,545
Bridal wreath.

1562
00:51:41,546 --> 00:51:43,455
- I know it. - And guksu tree.

1563
00:51:43,456 --> 00:51:44,715
I've seen guksu tree somewhere.

1564
00:51:44,716 --> 00:51:46,726
Let's get rid of Number Two, then.

1565
00:51:46,826 --> 00:51:48,325
Because gogi tree, kkwangkkwang tree,

1566
00:51:48,326 --> 00:51:49,656
and ahwae tree are...

1567
00:51:49,896 --> 00:51:52,056
Why did you give us such a quiz?

1568
00:51:54,026 --> 00:51:55,165
Hey, Tae Hyun.

1569
00:51:55,166 --> 00:51:56,335
(Meanwhile, Tae Hyun, the class of 1999...)

1570
00:51:56,336 --> 00:51:57,396
Tae Hyun.

1571
00:51:58,136 --> 00:52:01,436
(starts to look through the bookshelf.)

1572
00:52:02,336 --> 00:52:04,706
It'll be amazing if we find a tree encyclopedia here.

1573
00:52:05,076 --> 00:52:06,145
Is there one here?

1574
00:52:06,146 --> 00:52:08,875
I thought there would be a book on trees.

1575
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,545
If we find one, we never know what will happen.

1576
00:52:11,546 --> 00:52:13,716
We might run into it. We never know.

1577
00:52:13,986 --> 00:52:15,386
"Why Do Plants..."

1578
00:52:15,856 --> 00:52:16,856
(He found "Why Do Plants..." which is related the quiz.)

1579
00:52:16,857 --> 00:52:19,026
- Why? - The answer might be in here.

1580
00:52:19,056 --> 00:52:21,355
Is the ahwae tree on it?

1581
00:52:21,356 --> 00:52:22,455
I don't know.

1582
00:52:22,456 --> 00:52:24,226
(Laughing)

1583
00:52:25,296 --> 00:52:27,795
Anyway, you said the gogi tree did exist.

1584
00:52:27,796 --> 00:52:29,695
The gogi tree... No, it was the guksu tree.

1585
00:52:29,696 --> 00:52:31,335
- He said the guksu tree exists. - He saw one.

1586
00:52:31,336 --> 00:52:32,535
I think the gogi tree exists too.

1587
00:52:32,536 --> 00:52:33,736
Where did you see it?

1588
00:52:34,206 --> 00:52:35,975
- There's a gogi tree? - I mean, an ahwae tree is...

1589
00:52:35,976 --> 00:52:37,175
Wait. The guksu tree...

1590
00:52:37,176 --> 00:52:39,506
is the name of a noodle shop.

1591
00:52:39,676 --> 00:52:42,076
- You're right. Come on. - Yes.

1592
00:52:42,646 --> 00:52:45,116
- It's... - But do the rest of them exist?

1593
00:52:45,376 --> 00:52:47,345
A kkwangkkwang tree might be...

1594
00:52:47,346 --> 00:52:49,315
- a tree that's very firm. - Something like that.

1595
00:52:49,316 --> 00:52:52,115
We say when ice is frozen hard, it's kkwangkkwang.

1596
00:52:52,116 --> 00:52:54,085
- A kkwangkkwang tree might exist. - Do you think so?

1597
00:52:54,086 --> 00:52:55,256
It's because...

1598
00:52:55,796 --> 00:52:58,896
it's hard for the staff to come up with such a name.

1599
00:52:59,466 --> 00:53:00,626
That's strange.

1600
00:53:01,126 --> 00:53:02,265
"Hey. Throw a kkwangkkwang tree in there."

1601
00:53:02,266 --> 00:53:04,066
- That's weird. - If...

1602
00:53:04,136 --> 00:53:06,265
A guksu tree might look like guksu,

1603
00:53:06,266 --> 00:53:08,066
- the noodles. - It might look like noodles.

1604
00:53:08,106 --> 00:53:09,805
How about a gogi tree, then?

1605
00:53:09,806 --> 00:53:12,505
If "Gogi" are Chinese characters, it might make sense.

1606
00:53:12,506 --> 00:53:14,505
"Go" means high, and "Ki" means energy?

1607
00:53:14,506 --> 00:53:16,275
- High energy. - A gogi...

1608
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,445
Does the inside of it look red like gogi, the meat?

1609
00:53:18,446 --> 00:53:19,946
There's a bleeding tree.

1610
00:53:20,246 --> 00:53:22,916
It bleeds, so people thought it was meat and grilled it.

1611
00:53:23,456 --> 00:53:25,085
Does it smell like meat when chopped?

1612
00:53:25,086 --> 00:53:27,185
- It bleeds. - Exactly. In red.

1613
00:53:27,186 --> 00:53:29,626
You know? When there are many people,

1614
00:53:29,826 --> 00:53:31,456
- you get too many ideas. - Let's do it.

1615
00:53:31,596 --> 00:53:33,495
But I think the answer is the ahwae tree.

1616
00:53:33,496 --> 00:53:37,495
The staff would have gathered together to come up with a name.

1617
00:53:37,496 --> 00:53:38,936
- They made one name for sure. - They couldn't think of any.

1618
00:53:39,536 --> 00:53:41,665
Because they couldn't come up with anything, they said, "Why?"

1619
00:53:41,666 --> 00:53:44,705
(They called it, "Ahwae" because there were no options?)

1620
00:53:44,706 --> 00:53:46,505
- "Should we go with it, then?" - Just say, "Ahwae tree."

1621
00:53:46,506 --> 00:53:47,906
That's how they come up with it.

1622
00:53:48,176 --> 00:53:49,745
Is that how they come up with it?

1623
00:53:49,746 --> 00:53:51,315
(Is that how they come up with the examples?)

1624
00:53:51,316 --> 00:53:53,716
They are not that different from us.

1625
00:53:53,786 --> 00:53:56,216
Is that how you come up with the examples?

1626
00:53:56,616 --> 00:53:58,015
Gosh. Come to think of it...

1627
00:53:58,016 --> 00:53:59,786
Will it be a gogi tree, as they said "bulgogi?"

1628
00:54:00,986 --> 00:54:02,225
(A fake answer derived from the menu?)

1629
00:54:02,226 --> 00:54:03,326
- Right. - Yes.

1630
00:54:04,056 --> 00:54:05,326
A gogi tree?

1631
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:07,866
We should hurry and use the reattempt card.

1632
00:54:08,496 --> 00:54:09,735
We use the card already?

1633
00:54:09,736 --> 00:54:11,235
It's better to use it fast. Other places won't be different.

1634
00:54:11,236 --> 00:54:13,606
It's meaningless to save the reattempt card.

1635
00:54:13,966 --> 00:54:15,905
- Let's go. We can use the card. - The gogi...

1636
00:54:15,906 --> 00:54:17,475
- Let's do the gogi tree. - Number One, a gogi tree.

1637
00:54:17,476 --> 00:54:19,605
- Okay. We have the answer. - Okay.

1638
00:54:19,606 --> 00:54:20,946
Number One. Let's do it together.

1639
00:54:20,976 --> 00:54:21,976
One, two, three.

1640
00:54:21,977 --> 00:54:23,175
- A gogi tree. - A gogi tree.

1641
00:54:23,176 --> 00:54:24,245
(Which tree doesn't exist? 1. Gogi tree)

1642
00:54:24,246 --> 00:54:26,216
Number One, a gogi tree.

1643
00:54:26,286 --> 00:54:27,985
It'll be crazy if we get it right.

1644
00:54:27,986 --> 00:54:29,286
(2. Guksu tree, 3. Kkwangkkwang tree, 4. Ahwae tree)

1645
00:54:29,556 --> 00:54:30,885
Number One, a gogi tree.

1646
00:54:30,886 --> 00:54:34,386
(Will Team Handsome score their first point?)

1647
00:54:34,586 --> 00:54:36,125
(1. Gogi tree)

1648
00:54:36,126 --> 00:54:37,195
It's correct.

1649
00:54:37,196 --> 00:54:40,026
(1. Gogi tree)

1650
00:54:42,066 --> 00:54:43,166
I told you.

1651
00:54:43,236 --> 00:54:45,236
It feels great when we get it right.

1652
00:54:46,306 --> 00:54:47,705
(I love the dopamine rush.)

1653
00:54:47,706 --> 00:54:49,136
It's bulgogi's gogi.

1654
00:54:50,506 --> 00:54:52,575
(Current Score)

1655
00:54:52,576 --> 00:54:54,106
(Team Handsome versus Team Guys, 1 to 1)

1656
00:54:54,346 --> 00:54:55,546
What happened?

1657
00:54:55,876 --> 00:54:57,775
- I'll explain it. A guksu tree, - Yes.

1658
00:54:57,776 --> 00:55:01,045
A lace shrub, has a noodle-like part in its stem.

1659
00:55:01,046 --> 00:55:02,515
That's why it's called guksu, the noodles.

1660
00:55:02,516 --> 00:55:03,585
As for a kkwangkkwang tree,

1661
00:55:03,586 --> 00:55:05,685
some say, in the Jeolla Province's dialect,

1662
00:55:05,686 --> 00:55:07,425
kkwangkkwang means hard.

1663
00:55:07,426 --> 00:55:09,825
Some says it's called kkwangkkwang...

1664
00:55:09,826 --> 00:55:11,426
because it's the noise it makes when its leaves are burned.

1665
00:55:11,496 --> 00:55:13,126
- As for ahwae tree, - What's ahwae?

1666
00:55:13,296 --> 00:55:16,735
In Jeju dialect, there's a word "ahwaenang."

1667
00:55:16,736 --> 00:55:18,435
They adopted "ahwae" from "ahwaenang,"

1668
00:55:18,436 --> 00:55:20,206
and called it ahwae tree.

1669
00:55:20,436 --> 00:55:22,735
- Gosh. - Why did you throw gogi...

1670
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,906
- Tree. - tree in there?

1671
00:55:25,306 --> 00:55:27,675
- We didn't put a big meaning to it. - Wait.

1672
00:55:27,676 --> 00:55:29,746
- It's what I said. - He said...

1673
00:55:29,916 --> 00:55:32,115
When someone said, "Order some bulgogi,"

1674
00:55:32,116 --> 00:55:33,686
they decided to throw "gogi tree" in there.

1675
00:55:35,016 --> 00:55:36,955
(That's right.)

1676
00:55:36,956 --> 00:55:38,455
If they ordered a pizza, it would have been "a pizza tree."

1677
00:55:38,456 --> 00:55:40,286
- I couldn't think that far. - It's crazy.

1678
00:55:40,626 --> 00:55:42,285
- It's amazing. - It's going smoothly.

1679
00:55:42,286 --> 00:55:43,596
(Si Eon outsmarts the staff.)

1680
00:55:44,296 --> 00:55:45,625
- Ahwae. - Ahwae.

1681
00:55:45,626 --> 00:55:46,666
Gosh. Seriously.

1682
00:55:47,396 --> 00:55:48,766
It's all good since we got it right.

1683
00:55:50,196 --> 00:55:52,636
(Team Guys)

1684
00:55:53,966 --> 00:55:55,836
(Bonghwa is surrounded by the big mountains.)

1685
00:55:57,276 --> 00:55:59,245
(They are known for their pine trees...)

1686
00:55:59,246 --> 00:56:02,445
(and the pine mushrooms that grow on the pine trees.)

1687
00:56:02,446 --> 00:56:04,345
Can I suggest something?

1688
00:56:04,346 --> 00:56:05,375
Sounds good.

1689
00:56:05,376 --> 00:56:06,546
- I mean, - Yes.

1690
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,446
The stone pot rice is great, but...

1691
00:56:08,816 --> 00:56:10,156
- We got to have the stone pot rice. - Yes.

1692
00:56:10,316 --> 00:56:11,355
- We'll have that. - Yes.

1693
00:56:11,356 --> 00:56:12,756
Why don't we also order bulgogi?

1694
00:56:12,926 --> 00:56:13,956
Sounds good.

1695
00:56:14,326 --> 00:56:15,455
This is why I chose this team.

1696
00:56:15,456 --> 00:56:17,426
It sounds wonderful.

1697
00:56:17,756 --> 00:56:18,925
(Sir, join us.)

1698
00:56:18,926 --> 00:56:20,165
- Okay. The large one. - We'll order the large one.

1699
00:56:20,166 --> 00:56:21,425
- Yes. There are four of us. - The large one.

1700
00:56:21,426 --> 00:56:22,666
- That's perfect. Yes. - Yes.

1701
00:56:24,596 --> 00:56:26,006
Pine mushroom jeon and shingled hedgehog jeon.

1702
00:56:28,106 --> 00:56:30,075
You can't have them in the city.

1703
00:56:30,076 --> 00:56:32,005
I've never had pine mushrooms as jeon.

1704
00:56:32,006 --> 00:56:33,145
- What do you say? - I've never had it.

1705
00:56:33,146 --> 00:56:34,206
Sir.

1706
00:56:34,776 --> 00:56:38,345
We'll have four stone pot rice with pine mushrooms.

1707
00:56:38,346 --> 00:56:39,886
- Okay. - As for bulgogi...

1708
00:56:40,346 --> 00:56:42,085
- It's pine mushroom bulgogi. - Yes. We'll have that.

1709
00:56:42,086 --> 00:56:43,755
And can we get one pine mushroom jeon too?

1710
00:56:43,756 --> 00:56:44,816
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1711
00:56:45,926 --> 00:56:47,426
- What do you need? - Napkins.

1712
00:56:48,226 --> 00:56:49,856
I want to wipe my hands. Goodness.

1713
00:56:49,926 --> 00:56:51,526
I want to wipe my hands. Goodness.

1714
00:56:53,126 --> 00:56:55,096
It's always hectic around Jae Hyeon.

1715
00:56:55,226 --> 00:56:56,335
And the tissue box is even empty.

1716
00:56:56,336 --> 00:56:57,695
A lot is going on around him.

1717
00:56:57,696 --> 00:56:59,235
- There's no tissue. - Seriously.

1718
00:56:59,236 --> 00:57:00,735
We have to keep an eye on Jae Hyeon.

1719
00:57:00,736 --> 00:57:02,706
- We should really be focused. - Yes.

1720
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:04,735
Jae Hyeon always takes care...

1721
00:57:04,736 --> 00:57:06,145
- of the people near him. - Yes.

1722
00:57:06,146 --> 00:57:08,145
He was worried that I'd be cold.

1723
00:57:08,146 --> 00:57:09,846
I hope he takes care of himself.

1724
00:57:09,976 --> 00:57:11,416
Please.

1725
00:57:12,446 --> 00:57:13,446
Please.

1726
00:57:15,386 --> 00:57:16,386
- Okay. - Gosh.

1727
00:57:16,387 --> 00:57:17,985
(The pine mushroom meal is here.)

1728
00:57:17,986 --> 00:57:20,056
- It's amazing. - It's what a king would eat.

1729
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:25,125
(A warm pine mushroom bulgogi hot pot...)

1730
00:57:25,126 --> 00:57:26,525
(and pine mushroom jeon...)

1731
00:57:26,526 --> 00:57:27,926
(that's crispy outside and tender inside.)

1732
00:57:29,436 --> 00:57:31,936
(A feast at Bonghwa, the land of pine mushrooms)

1733
00:57:32,196 --> 00:57:34,106
We went to a 150-year-old house.

1734
00:57:36,636 --> 00:57:39,476
It must be so good because they put it everywhere.

1735
00:57:41,346 --> 00:57:43,175
- It's good. - I love it.

1736
00:57:43,176 --> 00:57:44,275
(I love it.)

1737
00:57:44,276 --> 00:57:45,446
- I love it. - It's tasty.

1738
00:57:45,716 --> 00:57:47,816
(Jae Hyeon grabs a piece of pine mushroom jeon.)

1739
00:57:48,546 --> 00:57:50,586
(Eating it in one bite)

1740
00:57:51,316 --> 00:57:52,955
- It's good. - Everything tastes good.

1741
00:57:52,956 --> 00:57:54,326
(The fragrant pine mushroom jeon explodes as soon as he chews it.)

1742
00:57:57,896 --> 00:58:00,166
(Amazed)

1743
00:58:00,966 --> 00:58:03,366
(He takes another bite right away.)

1744
00:58:04,096 --> 00:58:06,735
(The fragrant aroma of the pine mushrooms bursts.)

1745
00:58:06,736 --> 00:58:09,876
All pine mushrooms are from nature.

1746
00:58:10,076 --> 00:58:12,176
We can't cultivate them.

1747
00:58:12,236 --> 00:58:15,445
There are some mushrooms considered the most fragrant.

1748
00:58:15,446 --> 00:58:16,745
- There are three. - That's right.

1749
00:58:16,746 --> 00:58:18,746
Shingled hedgehog, pine mushrooms, and shiitake mushrooms.

1750
00:58:19,546 --> 00:58:20,546
I see.

1751
00:58:21,046 --> 00:58:24,186
(After explaining, he fills himself with the pine mushroom.)

1752
00:58:24,386 --> 00:58:25,585
You have to savour it with your nose.

1753
00:58:25,586 --> 00:58:27,485
I'm having it slowly. It's good.

1754
00:58:27,486 --> 00:58:28,486
Yes.

1755
00:58:29,056 --> 00:58:30,425
(The stone pot rice with pine mushrooms...)

1756
00:58:30,426 --> 00:58:31,756
(comes in the right time.)

1757
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:33,926
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1758
00:58:34,466 --> 00:58:36,895
Others put only a few, but this one is filled with it.

1759
00:58:36,896 --> 00:58:38,766
(When he opens the lid...)

1760
00:58:40,206 --> 00:58:41,906
(Ecstatic)

1761
00:58:42,706 --> 00:58:44,306
There are so many pine mushrooms in it.

1762
00:58:44,436 --> 00:58:45,975
(A generous amount of pine mushrooms)

1763
00:58:45,976 --> 00:58:47,406
- The aroma of it is... - Gosh. Look.

1764
00:58:47,776 --> 00:58:49,375
- The aroma of the mushrooms is... - It's crazy.

1765
00:58:49,376 --> 00:58:50,875
(A generous amount of pine mushrooms...)

1766
00:58:50,876 --> 00:58:52,375
(gushes out a rich aroma.)

1767
00:58:52,376 --> 00:58:54,885
- Do you want me to open it? - It's like rice in pine mushrooms.

1768
00:58:54,886 --> 00:58:56,086
It's hot. I'll do it for you.

1769
00:58:56,816 --> 00:58:58,116
- With these many... - Be careful.

1770
00:58:59,016 --> 00:59:00,085
Thank you.

1771
00:59:00,086 --> 00:59:01,786
(Steamy)

1772
00:59:04,326 --> 00:59:05,825
The rice is cooked well.

1773
00:59:05,826 --> 00:59:07,996
(They put the rice in another bowl.)

1774
00:59:08,866 --> 00:59:11,265
(Then they pour water into the emptied pot for sungnyung.)

1775
00:59:11,266 --> 00:59:12,436
We pour the hot water into it, right?

1776
00:59:14,636 --> 00:59:18,736
(Drizzling the soy sauce seasoning)

1777
00:59:19,476 --> 00:59:20,546
Like this.

1778
00:59:21,606 --> 00:59:25,245
(Eating a mouthful)

1779
00:59:25,246 --> 00:59:27,816
(Amazed)

1780
00:59:30,086 --> 00:59:31,955
(Seung Ho takes a bite too.)

1781
00:59:31,956 --> 00:59:33,826
It's sweet and tastes so good.

1782
00:59:34,586 --> 00:59:37,626
(Still, don't forget about pine mushroom bulgogi.)

1783
00:59:39,026 --> 00:59:42,736
(It's bulgogi absorbed in the pine mushrooms' aroma.)

1784
00:59:43,566 --> 00:59:44,966
Okay. I'll try it.

1785
00:59:45,496 --> 00:59:46,636
Okay. Help yourselves.

1786
00:59:49,236 --> 00:59:51,376
(His one bite equals a big bulgogi wrap.)

1787
00:59:52,646 --> 00:59:56,146
(They take a bite of bulgogi after Dong Hyun.)

1788
00:59:57,376 --> 00:59:59,845
(Out of all of them, )

1789
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:02,786
(the two are eating like crazy in a positive way.)

1790
01:00:06,586 --> 01:00:09,995
(No matter what others say next to them, )

1791
01:00:09,996 --> 01:00:13,196
(their mouths and hands never stop.)

1792
01:00:16,366 --> 01:00:22,776
(They eat the food incessantly.)

1793
01:00:24,106 --> 01:00:27,706
(Devouring)

1794
01:00:29,006 --> 01:00:33,116
(They empty the bowl in no time.)

1795
01:00:33,216 --> 01:00:35,045
If you were to build a house,

1796
01:00:35,046 --> 01:00:37,016
do you think you can live in hanok?

1797
01:00:38,856 --> 01:00:40,655
- I... - It must be a modernized one.

1798
01:00:40,656 --> 01:00:42,125
It has the vibe of hanok,

1799
01:00:42,126 --> 01:00:43,625
- It has a hanok's vibe. - but it should be well-heated,

1800
01:00:43,626 --> 01:00:45,455
well-insulated, and windproof.

1801
01:00:45,456 --> 01:00:47,325
I'm too used to living in an apartment.

1802
01:00:47,326 --> 01:00:49,466
Do you live in hanok?

1803
01:00:49,596 --> 01:00:51,836
- I don't live in hanok. - Where do you live then?

1804
01:00:51,966 --> 01:00:53,965
- It's an old Western-style house. - A house.

1805
01:00:53,966 --> 01:00:56,035
I used to live in an apartment but made my way out of it...

1806
01:00:56,036 --> 01:00:57,576
- because people blamed me. - Why?

1807
01:00:57,906 --> 01:00:59,646
"Why does an architect live in an apartment?"

1808
01:00:59,876 --> 01:01:01,406
- What about it? - What?

1809
01:01:01,476 --> 01:01:03,745
They blamed you for living in an apartment,

1810
01:01:03,746 --> 01:01:05,645
- not a fancy house? - That's right.

1811
01:01:05,646 --> 01:01:06,646
Really?

1812
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:07,986
- Anyway... - I see.

1813
01:01:08,546 --> 01:01:09,615
(I should live up to the expectations.)

1814
01:01:09,616 --> 01:01:11,686
Sir! Beef tartare...

1815
01:01:12,656 --> 01:01:15,225
- Is it a bad idea? - No. It sounds good.

1816
01:01:15,226 --> 01:01:16,256
(I love it.)

1817
01:01:17,956 --> 01:01:19,666
(Summoned suddenly)

1818
01:01:21,826 --> 01:01:23,195
(He detangles the beef tartare...)

1819
01:01:23,196 --> 01:01:26,036
(and mixes it with the pear.)

1820
01:01:27,906 --> 01:01:31,535
(Then he takes a bite right away.)

1821
01:01:31,536 --> 01:01:32,575
How is it?

1822
01:01:32,576 --> 01:01:34,805
(The frown of the truth is on.)

1823
01:01:34,806 --> 01:01:36,916
- With garlic. - That's really good.

1824
01:01:40,516 --> 01:01:43,785
(It tastes threateningly good.)

1825
01:01:43,786 --> 01:01:44,816
It's so good.

1826
01:01:44,986 --> 01:01:46,085
Don't be stressed out. Sleep when you're sleepy.

1827
01:01:46,086 --> 01:01:49,286
(How does Jae Hyeon, a pacifist, have it?)

1828
01:01:51,226 --> 01:01:52,226
(Surprised)
It's so good.

1829
01:01:54,066 --> 01:01:55,165
Is it good?

1830
01:01:55,166 --> 01:01:56,166
The beef tartare?

1831
01:01:56,636 --> 01:01:58,036
- It's the best of today. - Is it the best?

1832
01:01:58,766 --> 01:01:59,806
- Gosh. - The beef tartare.

1833
01:02:00,406 --> 01:02:01,605
I can totally taste the sweetness.

1834
01:02:01,606 --> 01:02:04,235
So far, we enjoyed the scent of the pine mushrooms.

1835
01:02:04,236 --> 01:02:07,406
But this is filled with flavours of garlic and sweet pears.

1836
01:02:07,846 --> 01:02:09,516
I think they put a whole pear in it.

1837
01:02:09,816 --> 01:02:11,845
It's 1 of the top 3 beef tartare I had.

1838
01:02:11,846 --> 01:02:12,986
(Jae Hyeon's top 3 beef tartare)

1839
01:02:13,216 --> 01:02:15,585
Jae Hyeon eats like a bird.

1840
01:02:15,586 --> 01:02:16,956
So if he finds it delicious, it's truly delicious.

1841
01:02:17,086 --> 01:02:19,155
It feels like drinking a beer...

1842
01:02:19,156 --> 01:02:20,426
after sweating a lot in the summer.

1843
01:02:20,756 --> 01:02:21,926
That's how good this is.

1844
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:29,535
(It's so tasty.)

1845
01:02:29,536 --> 01:02:30,935
- We've invigorated ourselves. - Thanks for the food.

1846
01:02:30,936 --> 01:02:33,305
- Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the food.

1847
01:02:33,306 --> 01:02:35,105
(They finish eating the meal in Bonghwa...)

1848
01:02:35,106 --> 01:02:36,906
(that will be remembered as a fragrant one.)

1849
01:02:37,076 --> 01:02:39,006
Bulgogi is the way to go on a cold day, right?

1850
01:02:39,406 --> 01:02:41,406
- It sounds good. - After getting the gogi tree right.

1851
01:02:41,706 --> 01:02:42,775
Yes. Seriously.

1852
01:02:42,776 --> 01:02:44,075
Can you make it into a ball easily?

1853
01:02:44,076 --> 01:02:45,746
Of course. It's amazing.

1854
01:02:46,386 --> 01:02:49,986
(The two older ones can't pass by the pile of snow.)

1855
01:02:50,316 --> 01:02:51,386
We can go in.

1856
01:02:52,386 --> 01:02:53,685
They're acting like children.

1857
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:56,496
(They make snowballs in no time.)

1858
01:02:56,956 --> 01:02:58,426
That's right.

1859
01:02:58,826 --> 01:03:00,495
- Hello. - Hello.

1860
01:03:00,496 --> 01:03:02,126
This must be a popular spot.

1861
01:03:02,296 --> 01:03:03,395
It must be famous.

1862
01:03:03,396 --> 01:03:04,666
They sell naengmyeon too.

1863
01:03:04,896 --> 01:03:06,365
We can put the old-fashioned bulgogi at the center...

1864
01:03:06,366 --> 01:03:07,965
- and have one naengmyeon each. - Sounds good.

1865
01:03:07,966 --> 01:03:09,135
What is the special naengmyeon...

1866
01:03:09,136 --> 01:03:10,976
that was introduced on "Wednesday Food Talk?"

1867
01:03:11,136 --> 01:03:12,505
- Do you want to try it? - Yukjeon naengmyeon.

1868
01:03:12,506 --> 01:03:13,775
- Yes. - That one.

1869
01:03:13,776 --> 01:03:15,575
Good. I'll get the special naengmyeon.

1870
01:03:15,576 --> 01:03:16,615
Do you want it?

1871
01:03:16,616 --> 01:03:18,075
- It might be too big. - Should I order it for you?

1872
01:03:18,076 --> 01:03:20,085
- It sounds good but... - Then you should have it.

1873
01:03:20,086 --> 01:03:21,716
- We can eat the leftovers. - Okay.

1874
01:03:21,916 --> 01:03:23,686
I usually order galbitang.

1875
01:03:23,786 --> 01:03:25,856
Order that, then. You can taste others too.

1876
01:03:26,056 --> 01:03:27,485
Do you want to share it if I order mul naengmyeon?

1877
01:03:27,486 --> 01:03:29,125
- Sounds good. - Okay. I like that.

1878
01:03:29,126 --> 01:03:31,595
Yi Kyung is so good.

1879
01:03:31,596 --> 01:03:33,266
You're our school's pride, Yi Kyung.

1880
01:03:34,026 --> 01:03:35,995
- Seriously. - Right, ma'am.

1881
01:03:35,996 --> 01:03:37,195
You weren't on the same team...

1882
01:03:37,196 --> 01:03:38,365
- with Yi Kyung last time. - It's my first time seeing him.

1883
01:03:38,366 --> 01:03:39,865
- I was in the team... - With my husband.

1884
01:03:39,866 --> 01:03:41,506
- with your husband. - Yes.

1885
01:03:41,736 --> 01:03:43,375
How are you with your husband?

1886
01:03:43,376 --> 01:03:44,706
- Not good. - Not good?

1887
01:03:45,076 --> 01:03:46,576
Why don't you go on the "Marriage Camp?"

1888
01:03:47,006 --> 01:03:48,805
- It's "Divorce Camp." - Right. "Divorce Camp."

1889
01:03:48,806 --> 01:03:50,215
(It's a show to think about marriage carefully.)

1890
01:03:50,216 --> 01:03:51,315
- Now? - Now?

1891
01:03:51,316 --> 01:03:52,915
I think they are fine so far.

1892
01:03:52,916 --> 01:03:54,285
- Of course. - When they say, "Not good,"

1893
01:03:54,286 --> 01:03:55,415
it means they are fine.

1894
01:03:55,416 --> 01:03:56,585
How did you first meet each other?

1895
01:03:56,586 --> 01:03:59,756
- He was an upperclassman. - I see.

1896
01:03:59,856 --> 01:04:01,125
It's always the school or the region.

1897
01:04:01,126 --> 01:04:02,425
- That's the case in the past. - Well.

1898
01:04:02,426 --> 01:04:03,955
He bought me food for no reason.

1899
01:04:03,956 --> 01:04:05,726
He bought me expensive jjajangmyeon.

1900
01:04:05,996 --> 01:04:07,495
If you didn't eat that jjajangmyeon...

1901
01:04:07,496 --> 01:04:09,166
- What? Exactly. - Men usually...

1902
01:04:09,796 --> 01:04:11,265
- He's funny. - Exactly.

1903
01:04:11,266 --> 01:04:14,165
(Bulgogi is ready while they're talking.)

1904
01:04:14,166 --> 01:04:16,536
- Galbitang is here. - It's his.

1905
01:04:16,636 --> 01:04:17,975
(The warm galbitang is Tae Hyun's.)

1906
01:04:17,976 --> 01:04:18,976
I didn't think about it...

1907
01:04:18,977 --> 01:04:20,045
- when I was young. - Here you are.

1908
01:04:20,046 --> 01:04:21,306
It's hot. Be careful.

1909
01:04:21,476 --> 01:04:22,806
Gosh. It's a legitimate one.

1910
01:04:23,416 --> 01:04:24,545
- Here you are. - Is this mul naengmyeon?

1911
01:04:24,546 --> 01:04:25,616
- Thank you. - Yes.

1912
01:04:26,916 --> 01:04:30,785
(Mul naengmyeon and special naengmyeon are served.)

1913
01:04:30,786 --> 01:04:32,355
- It's a vinegar bottle. - It's bulgogi...

1914
01:04:32,356 --> 01:04:33,585
that we're able to eat because you got the gogi tree right.

1915
01:04:33,586 --> 01:04:35,155
Gosh. It wasn't me who got it right.

1916
01:04:35,156 --> 01:04:36,156
(We did it together.)

1917
01:04:36,826 --> 01:04:39,896
(It's time to eat.)

1918
01:04:40,726 --> 01:04:42,526
(Savouring)

1919
01:04:43,466 --> 01:04:44,496
It's hot.

1920
01:04:44,966 --> 01:04:46,166
I think they're famous for beef too.

1921
01:04:46,406 --> 01:04:49,266
(Taking a big bite)

1922
01:04:51,776 --> 01:04:55,376
(Si Eon takes a bite of naengmyeon.)

1923
01:04:56,346 --> 01:05:00,786
(He makes a big wrap...)

1924
01:05:01,516 --> 01:05:02,585
Does it taste okay?

1925
01:05:02,586 --> 01:05:04,886
(and puts it straight in his mouth.)

1926
01:05:05,156 --> 01:05:06,955
Tae Hyun can't eat a large quantity of food,

1927
01:05:06,956 --> 01:05:08,686
but he makes wraps and eats in a proper manner.

1928
01:05:09,326 --> 01:05:12,796
It has been a while since I had a hot pot like this.

1929
01:05:13,566 --> 01:05:14,596
Bulgogi hot pot.

1930
01:05:14,866 --> 01:05:16,666
Pyongyang naengmyeon places have this dish.

1931
01:05:17,396 --> 01:05:19,135
You can't eat it if you fail to answer correctly.

1932
01:05:19,136 --> 01:05:20,236
No, you can't.

1933
01:05:21,466 --> 01:05:24,336
(The picky eater, Si Eon takes a bite of bulgogi.)

1934
01:05:24,636 --> 01:05:27,746
Had we failed to answer correctly, we wouldn't have gotten this food.

1935
01:05:28,146 --> 01:05:29,306
There's a chance...

1936
01:05:30,046 --> 01:05:32,476
your husband won't get a single meal today.

1937
01:05:32,916 --> 01:05:34,346
I wonder if the other team answered correctly.

1938
01:05:34,546 --> 01:05:35,845
I'm really curious.

1939
01:05:35,846 --> 01:05:37,056
Doesn't the production crew tell us?

1940
01:05:39,486 --> 01:05:42,386
(He drinks the naengmyeon broth.)

1941
01:05:43,296 --> 01:05:46,395
(He wraps yukjeon with naengmyeon noodles.)

1942
01:05:46,396 --> 01:05:48,965
You must've seen...

1943
01:05:48,966 --> 01:05:50,565
many buildings and houses.

1944
01:05:50,566 --> 01:05:53,436
In your opinion, which building is number one in your heart?

1945
01:05:54,236 --> 01:05:56,105
There's a building I saw in childhood. I bet you saw it.

1946
01:05:56,106 --> 01:05:59,575
- If you cross the Yanghwa Bridge... - Okay.

1947
01:05:59,576 --> 01:06:00,975
I cross the bridge often.

1948
01:06:00,976 --> 01:06:03,546
There's a place called the Jeoldusan Martyrs' Shrine.

1949
01:06:03,916 --> 01:06:05,946
It looks like an island.

1950
01:06:06,486 --> 01:06:09,385
Jeoldusan Martyrs' Shrine. It's...

1951
01:06:09,386 --> 01:06:11,285
- Isn't it a white building? - It's a church.

1952
01:06:11,286 --> 01:06:12,286
- A church? - Okay.

1953
01:06:12,287 --> 01:06:14,055
It looks a bit like an airplane.

1954
01:06:14,056 --> 01:06:15,285
- It's still there, right? - It's still there.

1955
01:06:15,286 --> 01:06:17,525
I found out later...

1956
01:06:17,526 --> 01:06:20,425
that it represents the hanok of Korea.

1957
01:06:20,426 --> 01:06:22,365
What looks like a bell tower at the top...

1958
01:06:22,366 --> 01:06:25,395
represents the martyrs' gat.

1959
01:06:25,396 --> 01:06:26,905
The architecture represents...

1960
01:06:26,906 --> 01:06:28,405
many things.

1961
01:06:28,406 --> 01:06:30,636
I learned about these things when I studied up on the building.

1962
01:06:31,036 --> 01:06:33,806
Even when I was a small child who didn't know anything,

1963
01:06:33,976 --> 01:06:37,076
I thought that it'd be great to make a building like that.

1964
01:06:37,216 --> 01:06:39,146
To this day, that thought hasn't changed.

1965
01:06:41,316 --> 01:06:42,346
Thank you.

1966
01:06:44,416 --> 01:06:48,986
(The picky Team Handsome members are having an eating show today.)

1967
01:06:50,056 --> 01:06:51,796
Shouldn't we stop eating?

1968
01:06:53,466 --> 01:06:55,396
Slap me so that I can stay awake.

1969
01:06:56,436 --> 01:06:57,536
I'll get arrested if I do that.

1970
01:06:58,066 --> 01:06:59,536
You're too hardcore.

1971
01:06:59,636 --> 01:07:01,306
I'm sorry. I'm used to such shows.

1972
01:07:01,366 --> 01:07:03,976
I don't know what to do if it's too quiet on a show.

1973
01:07:04,406 --> 01:07:05,805
Wait until you have a child.

1974
01:07:05,806 --> 01:07:07,345
(You'll take any jobs you can.)

1975
01:07:07,346 --> 01:07:08,975
I'm so curious about your child.

1976
01:07:08,976 --> 01:07:10,346
Do you want a daughter or a son?

1977
01:07:10,516 --> 01:07:11,546
A son.

1978
01:07:12,316 --> 01:07:13,385
I want a son too.

1979
01:07:13,386 --> 01:07:14,415
I'll be too nervous if I have a daughter.

1980
01:07:14,416 --> 01:07:15,645
- I agree. - What will I do...

1981
01:07:15,646 --> 01:07:17,716
if she dates someone strange and doesn't come home?

1982
01:07:18,656 --> 01:07:20,686
(Laughing)

1983
01:07:21,056 --> 01:07:22,386
You have two daughters.

1984
01:07:22,926 --> 01:07:24,656
I wanted daughters.

1985
01:07:24,756 --> 01:07:25,795
It's nice to raise daughters.

1986
01:07:25,796 --> 01:07:27,396
But what will you do if they have a boyfriend?

1987
01:07:28,026 --> 01:07:29,425
Let's say your daughter turns 20 and says,

1988
01:07:29,426 --> 01:07:30,935
"Dad, I have a boyfriend. I want to marry him."

1989
01:07:30,936 --> 01:07:32,235
"Honey, come on in."

1990
01:07:32,236 --> 01:07:34,266
I'll do everything I can.

1991
01:07:34,366 --> 01:07:35,465
What will you do?

1992
01:07:35,466 --> 01:07:36,676
I'll hire a detective.

1993
01:07:37,336 --> 01:07:38,605
(The honest words of the father with two daughters)

1994
01:07:38,606 --> 01:07:40,976
I'll do my absolute best...

1995
01:07:41,206 --> 01:07:42,906
to keep it from happening.

1996
01:07:43,316 --> 01:07:45,215
If it doesn't work out, I'll have no choice...

1997
01:07:45,216 --> 01:07:46,646
but to accept her life.

1998
01:07:46,746 --> 01:07:47,815
That's so funny.

1999
01:07:47,816 --> 01:07:49,015
(My stomach feels empty.)

2000
01:07:49,016 --> 01:07:50,255
Tae Hyun usually doesn't eat like that.

2001
01:07:50,256 --> 01:07:52,886
Talking about his daughters made him eat angrily.

2002
01:07:54,086 --> 01:07:55,185
He usually doesn't eat like that.

2003
01:07:55,186 --> 01:07:56,225
Eat up, Tae Hyun.

2004
01:07:56,226 --> 01:07:57,626
- We won't answer correctly now. - Seriously.

2005
01:07:59,156 --> 01:08:00,665
It was a really nice meal.

2006
01:08:00,666 --> 01:08:01,866
The atmosphere is nice.

2007
01:08:01,926 --> 01:08:03,096
It's nice.

2008
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:05,295
I wonder if they got the same question...

2009
01:08:05,296 --> 01:08:07,266
and answered correctly.

2010
01:08:07,936 --> 01:08:08,936
I bet they did.

2011
01:08:09,566 --> 01:08:12,236
There weren't many possible answers.

2012
01:08:12,876 --> 01:08:14,845
They would've reached the answer had they thought about it.

2013
01:08:14,846 --> 01:08:18,516
I bet they got the first one right.

2014
01:08:18,546 --> 01:08:21,246
My guess is that they used a reattempt card...

2015
01:08:21,416 --> 01:08:23,256
at the 1st or 2nd spot.

2016
01:08:23,786 --> 01:08:25,286
If they get the third one wrong,

2017
01:08:25,716 --> 01:08:26,756
it'll be the best.

2018
01:08:27,386 --> 01:08:29,255
We just need to get all three questions right.

2019
01:08:29,256 --> 01:08:30,355
- That's right. - Yes.

2020
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,326
If we answer two more questions, we'll be done.

2021
01:08:32,896 --> 01:08:35,096
(We'll win no matter what!)

2022
01:08:36,436 --> 01:08:37,636
I'm curious.

2023
01:08:37,766 --> 01:08:38,995
Andong, Hahoe Folk Village.

2024
01:08:38,996 --> 01:08:41,336
(They spot the destination!)

2025
01:08:41,566 --> 01:08:43,476
We'll get a question about the Hahoe mask.

2026
01:08:44,136 --> 01:08:46,476
I'll ask ChatGPT just in case.

2027
01:08:48,376 --> 01:08:50,416
- Andong, Hahoe Folk Village. - Yes.

2028
01:08:51,076 --> 01:08:52,775
(He quickly asks a question...)

2029
01:08:52,776 --> 01:08:54,986
(and reads the answer carefully.)

2030
01:08:55,046 --> 01:08:57,915
"There's a big change a quiz about the Hahoe Folk Village..."

2031
01:08:57,916 --> 01:08:59,055
"will cover..."

2032
01:08:59,056 --> 01:09:01,256
"Korea's history, architecture, and historical figures."

2033
01:09:01,756 --> 01:09:03,726
"Here are a few possible questions."

2034
01:09:04,026 --> 01:09:05,396
"Which river..."

2035
01:09:06,126 --> 01:09:09,296
"surrounds the Hahoe Folk Village?"

2036
01:09:09,596 --> 01:09:11,265
Han River, Nakdong River, Geum River,

2037
01:09:11,266 --> 01:09:12,266
- Yeongsan River. - Nakdong River.

2038
01:09:12,267 --> 01:09:13,666
Nakdong River. Correct.

2039
01:09:13,966 --> 01:09:15,265
"What's the name of the traditional mask show..."

2040
01:09:15,266 --> 01:09:16,576
"that's famous at the Hahoe Folk Village?"

2041
01:09:17,436 --> 01:09:19,135
- It'll be nice to know... - You know...

2042
01:09:19,136 --> 01:09:20,445
such information.

2043
01:09:20,446 --> 01:09:21,475
The choices make it easy.

2044
01:09:21,476 --> 01:09:24,645
Mask dance, Hahoe byeolsin exorcism mask play,

2045
01:09:24,646 --> 01:09:25,915
Ganggangsullae, Lion Dance.

2046
01:09:25,916 --> 01:09:27,946
It has to be the answer that contains "Hahoe."

2047
01:09:28,416 --> 01:09:29,916
- There isn't a twist, right? - That's right.

2048
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:31,786
There's a nonsense quiz.

2049
01:09:32,316 --> 01:09:34,656
- Here's one example. - Okay.

2050
01:09:34,856 --> 01:09:37,596
"Which account does the Hahoe mask like the most?"

2051
01:09:37,796 --> 01:09:40,066
Fake account.

2052
01:09:40,266 --> 01:09:41,365
(Incredulous)

2053
01:09:41,366 --> 01:09:42,466
Fake account?

2054
01:09:43,866 --> 01:09:45,966
"Which TV show does the Hahoe mask like the most?"

2055
01:09:46,706 --> 01:09:47,736
TV show?

2056
01:09:48,106 --> 01:09:49,206
"The King of Mask Singer."

2057
01:09:49,806 --> 01:09:51,875
(An unexpected answer)

2058
01:09:51,876 --> 01:09:54,306
ChatGPT is giving me strange questions.

2059
01:09:54,706 --> 01:09:56,145
No.

2060
01:09:56,146 --> 01:09:59,075
- We have to solve it ourselves. - Yes.

2061
01:09:59,076 --> 01:10:00,315
(We have to solve it ourselves.)

2062
01:10:00,316 --> 01:10:01,645
Let's keep ourselves energized.

2063
01:10:01,646 --> 01:10:02,816
(They laugh and talk.)

2064
01:10:03,356 --> 01:10:04,986
It's my first time coming to the Hahoe Folk Village.

2065
01:10:05,556 --> 01:10:06,825
Rakkojae.

2066
01:10:06,826 --> 01:10:08,056
(They arrive at Rakkojae.)

2067
01:10:08,226 --> 01:10:10,595
I think I've seen a similar hotel.

2068
01:10:10,596 --> 01:10:11,796
(We're at a hanok hotel, not the Hahoe Folk Village!)

2069
01:10:13,156 --> 01:10:16,325
Are we checking out Rakkojae, not the Hahoe Folk Village?

2070
01:10:16,326 --> 01:10:18,296
- Are we checking out the hotel? - Yes.

2071
01:10:20,436 --> 01:10:21,436
My goodness.

2072
01:10:21,437 --> 01:10:23,035
(Welcome to Rakkojae, a hanok hotel.)

2073
01:10:23,036 --> 01:10:25,275
- It's nice. - It's nice.

2074
01:10:25,276 --> 01:10:26,375
(Handsome Architecture 3: A night at hanok)

2075
01:10:26,376 --> 01:10:28,346
- It's really nice. - It's so serene here.

2076
01:10:28,606 --> 01:10:30,776
- In Seoul... - Hello.

2077
01:10:30,876 --> 01:10:32,276
- My goodness. - Hello.

2078
01:10:32,676 --> 01:10:34,145
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2079
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:35,246
They don't disappoint.

2080
01:10:35,386 --> 01:10:36,486
It's warm.

2081
01:10:36,716 --> 01:10:38,655
I keep getting food since I joined a nice team.

2082
01:10:38,656 --> 01:10:39,686
Yakgwa.

2083
01:10:39,756 --> 01:10:41,955
- Yakgwa. - Thank you.

2084
01:10:41,956 --> 01:10:43,855
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

2085
01:10:43,856 --> 01:10:44,896
I love hot tea.

2086
01:10:45,556 --> 01:10:46,666
It smells like pumpkin.

2087
01:10:47,096 --> 01:10:49,126
Let's warm our bodies first.

2088
01:10:49,596 --> 01:10:50,596
Pumpkin tea.

2089
01:10:51,136 --> 01:10:53,505
You saw a traditional hanok that was 150 years old...

2090
01:10:53,506 --> 01:10:54,536
earlier.

2091
01:10:54,636 --> 01:10:55,936
This place...

2092
01:10:56,166 --> 01:10:59,305
shows people's effort to modernize hanok.

2093
01:10:59,306 --> 01:11:00,445
The traditional hanok is...

2094
01:11:00,446 --> 01:11:03,176
a place that's fitting for people who sit on the floor.

2095
01:11:03,646 --> 01:11:06,315
So the kitchen is small...

2096
01:11:06,316 --> 01:11:08,645
and the ceiling is low. It can be inconvenient.

2097
01:11:08,646 --> 01:11:10,315
This building...

2098
01:11:10,316 --> 01:11:13,286
modernized such matters.

2099
01:11:13,886 --> 01:11:15,255
Hanok can be inconvenient...

2100
01:11:15,256 --> 01:11:16,695
- when it comes to heating. - Yes.

2101
01:11:16,696 --> 01:11:17,955
If such problems get solved,

2102
01:11:17,956 --> 01:11:19,725
I'd love to build a house like this...

2103
01:11:19,726 --> 01:11:21,625
and live in it.

2104
01:11:21,626 --> 01:11:24,065
I think the charm of hanok...

2105
01:11:24,066 --> 01:11:25,766
lies in its naturalness.

2106
01:11:26,036 --> 01:11:27,765
How can regular people enjoy...

2107
01:11:27,766 --> 01:11:30,875
the good things of hanok?

2108
01:11:30,876 --> 01:11:32,005
- Let's go to the room... - That sounds good.

2109
01:11:32,006 --> 01:11:33,475
And take a look around.

2110
01:11:33,476 --> 01:11:35,245
Let's go and see. I'm curious.

2111
01:11:35,246 --> 01:11:37,146
(Shall we check out the ideas at the room?)

2112
01:11:38,716 --> 01:11:41,216
Hahoe Folk Village is very close.

2113
01:11:41,446 --> 01:11:43,415
When people visit the Hahoe Folk Village,

2114
01:11:43,416 --> 01:11:45,415
they see many folk houses.

2115
01:11:45,416 --> 01:11:48,555
So there are about five cabins that show the royal style.

2116
01:11:48,556 --> 01:11:50,695
The rest of the cabins show the folk style...

2117
01:11:50,696 --> 01:11:52,056
in the hotel.

2118
01:11:52,726 --> 01:11:53,726
Don't you think...

2119
01:11:54,096 --> 01:11:56,295
the pond and pavilion look familiar?

2120
01:11:56,296 --> 01:11:58,796
- Yes. The palace. - At that place.

2121
01:11:59,766 --> 01:12:02,306
- Where? - At that place.

2122
01:12:02,706 --> 01:12:03,706
Changdeokgung Palace.

2123
01:12:03,707 --> 01:12:05,935
That's right. Correct.

2124
01:12:05,936 --> 01:12:08,005
- Changdeokgung Palace. - It's at the back of the palace.

2125
01:12:08,006 --> 01:12:09,275
- The secret pond. - Buyongji Pond.

2126
01:12:09,276 --> 01:12:10,445
- Buyongji Pond. - That's right.

2127
01:12:10,446 --> 01:12:11,575
Buyongji Pond?

2128
01:12:11,576 --> 01:12:12,746
(A pond that resembles the Buyongji Pond?)

2129
01:12:13,346 --> 01:12:14,885
Buyongji Pond and Buyongjeong.

2130
01:12:14,886 --> 01:12:19,956
(Rakkojae has the Buyongji Pond and Buyongjeong.)

2131
01:12:20,856 --> 01:12:22,855
(It was modelled after the Secret Garden...)

2132
01:12:22,856 --> 01:12:24,856
(of the Changdeokgung Palace in Seoul.)

2133
01:12:25,696 --> 01:12:28,495
(They measured the actual Buyongjeong...)

2134
01:12:28,496 --> 01:12:32,095
(and made it nearly identical.)

2135
01:12:32,096 --> 01:12:34,265
They turned it into a cabin.

2136
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:35,705
- What? - Let's go inside.

2137
01:12:35,706 --> 01:12:37,105
- Is it a cabin? - Yes.

2138
01:12:37,106 --> 01:12:38,106
- It's nice. - Go inside.

2139
01:12:38,107 --> 01:12:39,605
- What's the passcode? - Isn't it great?

2140
01:12:39,606 --> 01:12:41,006
- The passcode. - There's a lock.

2141
01:12:41,476 --> 01:12:42,575
- Shall we enter? - Yes.

2142
01:12:42,576 --> 01:12:43,775
Let's go inside.

2143
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:47,015
(Behind the paper-lined doors, a cosy cabin unfolds.)

2144
01:12:47,016 --> 01:12:48,086
- What? - It's unique.

2145
01:12:49,486 --> 01:12:51,155
- It's warm. - It's nice.

2146
01:12:51,156 --> 01:12:52,985
- It's warm. - It's so nice.

2147
01:12:52,986 --> 01:12:55,556
(There's a floor at the front.)

2148
01:12:56,156 --> 01:13:00,426
(They can feel the vibe of hanok.)

2149
01:13:01,066 --> 01:13:02,466
It's so nice.

2150
01:13:03,096 --> 01:13:04,196
Seriously, this place...

2151
01:13:04,596 --> 01:13:05,666
This place...

2152
01:13:06,136 --> 01:13:07,206
This place is incredible.

2153
01:13:07,806 --> 01:13:08,906
I'll be great...

2154
01:13:09,236 --> 01:13:11,876
- to come here on a trip later. - Isn't it nice?

2155
01:13:12,606 --> 01:13:16,076
They made this cabin...

2156
01:13:16,376 --> 01:13:18,345
- for newlyweds. - It's nice.

2157
01:13:18,346 --> 01:13:19,646
Listen.

2158
01:13:19,746 --> 01:13:21,585
What will the newlyweds do...

2159
01:13:21,586 --> 01:13:24,415
if people put holes in the windows and look through them?

2160
01:13:24,416 --> 01:13:26,156
It won't be so easy to approach the cabin.

2161
01:13:26,656 --> 01:13:28,525
This cabin is warm.

2162
01:13:28,526 --> 01:13:29,656
- That's right. - It's warm.

2163
01:13:29,786 --> 01:13:31,326
The floor is heated, right?

2164
01:13:31,356 --> 01:13:33,465
- That's right. - This place is very nice.

2165
01:13:33,466 --> 01:13:35,626
The atmosphere is very warm.

2166
01:13:35,996 --> 01:13:37,635
You can install heating on the floor.

2167
01:13:37,636 --> 01:13:39,266
It's warm.

2168
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:41,635
- The restroom. - The restroom.

2169
01:13:41,636 --> 01:13:42,936
What's this?

2170
01:13:42,966 --> 01:13:45,206
I want to design my house like this.

2171
01:13:45,676 --> 01:13:47,806
- Look at the ceiling. - It's shaped like hanok.

2172
01:13:48,346 --> 01:13:50,146
I love the indirect lighting.

2173
01:13:50,876 --> 01:13:51,876
Seriously.

2174
01:13:52,076 --> 01:13:53,446
- This is... - Shall we go inside?

2175
01:13:53,686 --> 01:13:54,886
What? Gosh, it startled me.

2176
01:13:55,086 --> 01:13:56,286
It's a double-pane window.

2177
01:13:56,516 --> 01:13:58,986
- A double-pane window. - It was fun.

2178
01:13:59,286 --> 01:14:01,826
It's from the Joseon Dynasty, right?

2179
01:14:02,056 --> 01:14:04,955
- Were there coffee machines? - It's from the Joseon Dynasty.

2180
01:14:04,956 --> 01:14:06,526
What's over there? There's another door.

2181
01:14:06,556 --> 01:14:08,196
It's storage area.

2182
01:14:08,566 --> 01:14:10,196
- It's a fridge. - A fridge.

2183
01:14:10,266 --> 01:14:11,366
Dongbinggo.

2184
01:14:11,766 --> 01:14:13,196
There's Dongbinggo in here.

2185
01:14:13,806 --> 01:14:15,605
What you see over there is called the four-direction table.

2186
01:14:15,606 --> 01:14:16,606
I'm sure you've seen it.

2187
01:14:16,607 --> 01:14:18,376
- The table. - The four-direction table.

2188
01:14:18,706 --> 01:14:19,976
There are such furniture pieces.

2189
01:14:20,646 --> 01:14:23,545
They put an authentic piece here.

2190
01:14:23,546 --> 01:14:24,576
Yes.

2191
01:14:25,316 --> 01:14:27,316
- It's from the 15th century. - What?

2192
01:14:27,416 --> 01:14:29,345
- Are you serious? - That's what it says here.

2193
01:14:29,346 --> 01:14:30,386
- What? - Joseon white porcelain.

2194
01:14:30,986 --> 01:14:32,215
Is it a good idea to put it here?

2195
01:14:32,216 --> 01:14:33,485
(Joseon white porcelain is on the table.)

2196
01:14:33,486 --> 01:14:34,786
Hold on. This is...

2197
01:14:35,456 --> 01:14:37,725
- Is it inexpensive? - What?

2198
01:14:37,726 --> 01:14:39,895
- It's from the 15th century. - It can't be cheap.

2199
01:14:39,896 --> 01:14:42,565
Think about how valuable it must be. We can't take it, right?

2200
01:14:42,566 --> 01:14:44,235
Is it a good idea to put it here?

2201
01:14:44,236 --> 01:14:46,436
The employees will need to check it every time.

2202
01:14:46,466 --> 01:14:48,905
It'll be hard to do that.

2203
01:14:48,906 --> 01:14:50,376
This is incredible.

2204
01:14:50,806 --> 01:14:52,306
This is incredible. All of these pieces are authentic.

2205
01:14:52,676 --> 01:14:54,075
- Goryeo celadon. - Hurry up and put one...

2206
01:14:54,076 --> 01:14:55,276
- in your pocket. - It's from the 13th century.

2207
01:14:55,446 --> 01:14:57,275
- Put one in your pocket. - The 13th century?

2208
01:14:57,276 --> 01:14:58,915
Isn't that the year of 1200?

2209
01:14:58,916 --> 01:15:01,415
That's right. That's the year of 1200.

2210
01:15:01,416 --> 01:15:02,586
It's 800 years old.

2211
01:15:02,986 --> 01:15:04,515
- If... - Look at this place.

2212
01:15:04,516 --> 01:15:07,386
This is the handwriting of King Yeongjo.

2213
01:15:08,026 --> 01:15:09,155
- What? - It's his handwriting.

2214
01:15:09,156 --> 01:15:10,655
- Is it authentic? - It's authentic.

2215
01:15:10,656 --> 01:15:11,955
- Hold on. - It's real.

2216
01:15:11,956 --> 01:15:13,256
- I mean... - I mean...

2217
01:15:13,596 --> 01:15:14,795
- I see. - But...

2218
01:15:14,796 --> 01:15:17,165
It's read as, "Gyeongisoneokgijo."

2219
01:15:17,166 --> 01:15:18,895
So that's the meaning.

2220
01:15:18,896 --> 01:15:21,465
"Looking at my grandson makes me think of my grandfather."

2221
01:15:21,466 --> 01:15:22,905
(A phrase King Yeongjo wrote a few days before passing)

2222
01:15:22,906 --> 01:15:24,135
- Sir, outside... - Yes?

2223
01:15:24,136 --> 01:15:25,375
You can't see it from here.

2224
01:15:25,376 --> 01:15:26,735
What does the toad represent?

2225
01:15:26,736 --> 01:15:29,105
- Well, we... - Yes?

2226
01:15:29,106 --> 01:15:30,346
Shall we open the window?

2227
01:15:31,116 --> 01:15:35,845
(He decides to explain as they look outside the window.)

2228
01:15:35,846 --> 01:15:37,415
- It's nice. - It's pretty.

2229
01:15:37,416 --> 01:15:41,185
(The view of the pond unfolds before their eyes.)

2230
01:15:41,186 --> 01:15:43,385
There is a term called...

2231
01:15:43,386 --> 01:15:44,926
the borrowed scenery.

2232
01:15:44,956 --> 01:15:47,696
It's a principle of garden design.

2233
01:15:47,796 --> 01:15:51,336
It makes the mountains and scenery enter the window.

2234
01:15:51,936 --> 01:15:55,905
At the pond by the pavilion in the Changdeokgung Palace,

2235
01:15:55,906 --> 01:15:58,335
a state exam took place back in the day.

2236
01:15:58,336 --> 01:16:00,746
- There's a carving of a carp. - I see.

2237
01:16:00,946 --> 01:16:02,846
A carp can turn into a dragon.

2238
01:16:02,906 --> 01:16:04,745
"Take the exam well and become a dragon."

2239
01:16:04,746 --> 01:16:06,915
"This is the gateway." That's the meaning.

2240
01:16:06,916 --> 01:16:08,445
But this hotel didn't make a carp statue.

2241
01:16:08,446 --> 01:16:09,815
- Toad. - It made a toad statue.

2242
01:16:09,816 --> 01:16:12,286
- What does a toad become? - Well,

2243
01:16:12,316 --> 01:16:13,385
it's a symbol of wealth...

2244
01:16:13,386 --> 01:16:14,785
- and childbirth. - It's fitting.

2245
01:16:14,786 --> 01:16:16,356
- When newlyweds stay here... - What?

2246
01:16:16,426 --> 01:16:17,455
- Male babies are likened to toads. - It's a message.

2247
01:16:17,456 --> 01:16:18,896
"Have a son like a toad."

2248
01:16:19,126 --> 01:16:21,665
It's a witty message from the owner of the hotel.

2249
01:16:21,666 --> 01:16:23,665
There's another interesting thing.

2250
01:16:23,666 --> 01:16:26,095
- The pond is rectangular, right? - Yes.

2251
01:16:26,096 --> 01:16:28,365
And there's a circular island inside.

2252
01:16:28,366 --> 01:16:30,165
It reflects the ancient belief...

2253
01:16:30,166 --> 01:16:31,706
that the sky is round...

2254
01:16:31,876 --> 01:16:34,506
- and the Earth is square. - That's the meaning.

2255
01:16:35,476 --> 01:16:37,615
(Round Sky and Square Earth is an Eastern philosophy...)

2256
01:16:37,616 --> 01:16:39,745
(which states that everything is a balance of yin and yang.)

2257
01:16:39,746 --> 01:16:42,216
- It's an Eastern philosophy. - I see.

2258
01:16:42,416 --> 01:16:44,755
If you study hanok,

2259
01:16:44,756 --> 01:16:46,716
the buildings contain many such meanings.

2260
01:16:46,756 --> 01:16:48,855
Let's sit here and enjoy the scenery...

2261
01:16:48,856 --> 01:16:50,155
as if we had become kings.

2262
01:16:50,156 --> 01:16:51,256
(Shall we sit inside the Buyongjeong and enjoy the Buyongji?)

2263
01:16:52,856 --> 01:16:53,865
I love this vibe.

2264
01:16:53,866 --> 01:16:55,025
It's raining too.

2265
01:16:55,026 --> 01:16:57,135
This place would've been pretty with the sun.

2266
01:16:57,136 --> 01:16:59,335
But the rain made it even more atmospheric.

2267
01:16:59,336 --> 01:17:01,066
- The timing was great. - Yes.

2268
01:17:01,136 --> 01:17:03,976
- It snowed in March. - Rakkojae.

2269
01:17:04,006 --> 01:17:07,005
If I come here with my wife, it'll be totally therapeutic.

2270
01:17:07,006 --> 01:17:09,106
Imagine getting the pine mushroom rice for dinner.

2271
01:17:09,206 --> 01:17:11,345
It'll be great to escape the burden of childcare...

2272
01:17:11,346 --> 01:17:13,576
and rest for a day without a worry.

2273
01:17:13,616 --> 01:17:15,946
People who study interior design should visit...

2274
01:17:15,986 --> 01:17:18,016
- and learn about the place. - I know.

2275
01:17:19,286 --> 01:17:20,725
It would've been very nice...

2276
01:17:20,726 --> 01:17:22,155
- had the weather been sunny. - Yes.

2277
01:17:22,156 --> 01:17:24,425
The weather is a bit gloomy.

2278
01:17:24,426 --> 01:17:25,695
- It's a cat. - Yes.

2279
01:17:25,696 --> 01:17:28,125
(Meowing)

2280
01:17:28,126 --> 01:17:30,365
- Fatty. - It's kneading.

2281
01:17:30,366 --> 01:17:31,796
Fatty.

2282
01:17:32,596 --> 01:17:33,765
Fatty.

2283
01:17:33,766 --> 01:17:34,805
(The friendly cat doesn't run away when the trio approaches it.)

2284
01:17:34,806 --> 01:17:35,906
Fatty.

2285
01:17:35,936 --> 01:17:38,376
- This cat likes people. - Fatty.

2286
01:17:38,836 --> 01:17:40,405
- It's brushing against you. - Fatty.

2287
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:41,505
Cats do that when they like people.

2288
01:17:41,506 --> 01:17:42,945
- Fatty. - It's rubbing its body on you.

2289
01:17:42,946 --> 01:17:44,016
(The cat rubs its body against them and acts cute.)

2290
01:17:44,476 --> 01:17:46,246
This cat loves people.

2291
01:17:46,846 --> 01:17:47,846
(They say goodbye to the chubby cat.)

2292
01:17:47,847 --> 01:17:49,346
Please come this way.

2293
01:17:50,786 --> 01:17:51,786
(Let's check out the next cabin.)

2294
01:17:51,787 --> 01:17:53,616
Why is it kneading?

2295
01:17:54,186 --> 01:17:58,756
(This cabin is a recreation of a nobleman's house.)

2296
01:17:59,626 --> 01:18:02,196
Do you see the roof tiles?

2297
01:18:02,526 --> 01:18:05,265
Had they used the new ones, they would've been too black.

2298
01:18:05,266 --> 01:18:08,835
So they created the aged colour...

2299
01:18:08,836 --> 01:18:10,166
on purpose.

2300
01:18:11,806 --> 01:18:13,876
Guests must be staying here.

2301
01:18:14,306 --> 01:18:17,545
This place is like a suite.

2302
01:18:17,546 --> 01:18:18,816
- This place? - Yes.

2303
01:18:19,346 --> 01:18:20,745
It's huge.

2304
01:18:20,746 --> 01:18:22,615
Let's go inside.

2305
01:18:22,616 --> 01:18:23,816
(What kind of charms will this cabin have?)

2306
01:18:26,086 --> 01:18:28,225
(Since it's a suite, )

2307
01:18:28,226 --> 01:18:30,055
(the inside is spacious...)

2308
01:18:30,056 --> 01:18:31,895
(and the furniture is conveniently placed.)

2309
01:18:31,896 --> 01:18:34,265
(This cabin also has a floor...)

2310
01:18:34,266 --> 01:18:36,466
(that brings out the hanok sentimentality!)

2311
01:18:37,336 --> 01:18:38,795
I absolutely love that.

2312
01:18:38,796 --> 01:18:40,295
- I want to sit here. - We can stare at the fire.

2313
01:18:40,296 --> 01:18:42,566
You know, I...

2314
01:18:42,966 --> 01:18:45,236
I told you that I require the wood and fire elements...

2315
01:18:45,306 --> 01:18:48,105
according to my saju of destiny reading.

2316
01:18:48,106 --> 01:18:51,146
- You like such fireplaces. - I love houses with a fireplace.

2317
01:18:51,376 --> 01:18:53,276
- This is incredible. - Dong Hyun.

2318
01:18:53,446 --> 01:18:54,685
- It's a traditional fireplace. - It's so warm.

2319
01:18:54,686 --> 01:18:55,686
Is it incredible?

2320
01:18:55,687 --> 01:18:57,385
- It's so warm. - It's like a traditional fireplace.

2321
01:18:57,386 --> 01:18:58,615
- Come here. - Come here.

2322
01:18:58,616 --> 01:19:00,185
- Hold on. Sir. - Yes?

2323
01:19:00,186 --> 01:19:01,555
Is this fireplace heating up...

2324
01:19:01,556 --> 01:19:02,925
- the floor? - Yes.

2325
01:19:02,926 --> 01:19:04,395
- There's gorae or a smoke passage. - Really?

2326
01:19:04,396 --> 01:19:05,455
Yes, there is.

2327
01:19:05,456 --> 01:19:07,095
Over there,

2328
01:19:07,096 --> 01:19:08,665
- do you see a chimney? - Yes.

2329
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:10,365
- Smoke is coming out. - Is it coming from this fireplace?

2330
01:19:10,366 --> 01:19:12,166
- Yes. It's from this fireplace. - I see.

2331
01:19:12,266 --> 01:19:14,735
- It brings back memories. - Smoke travels through the passage.

2332
01:19:14,736 --> 01:19:16,736
Staying warm is the best in winter.

2333
01:19:16,966 --> 01:19:19,376
- Seriously. - Yes.

2334
01:19:19,406 --> 01:19:21,476
- Smoke comes out. - A long cave connects them.

2335
01:19:21,776 --> 01:19:23,375
Smoke travels through the passage...

2336
01:19:23,376 --> 01:19:25,016
and goes out the chimney.

2337
01:19:25,276 --> 01:19:27,045
Sitting here makes my body feel warm.

2338
01:19:27,046 --> 01:19:29,146
I want to take a nap here.

2339
01:19:29,816 --> 01:19:32,215
(If you take a nap, you'll miss the precious artifacts.)

2340
01:19:32,216 --> 01:19:33,755
It's by Sojeong.

2341
01:19:33,756 --> 01:19:35,485
It says "Sojeong" right here.

2342
01:19:35,486 --> 01:19:38,155
- Who is that? - Sojeong Pyon Kwan Sik.

2343
01:19:38,156 --> 01:19:40,395
He's a very famous artist of the Eastern art...

2344
01:19:40,396 --> 01:19:41,896
from the 20th century.

2345
01:19:42,196 --> 01:19:45,895
(Perhaps it'll be like a night in a small art museum.)

2346
01:19:45,896 --> 01:19:47,066
Over here...

2347
01:19:47,936 --> 01:19:49,005
What is it?

2348
01:19:49,006 --> 01:19:50,066
- No way. - What?

2349
01:19:50,166 --> 01:19:51,505
- I'll reveal it. - Okay.

2350
01:19:51,506 --> 01:19:53,736
(Here comes the grand reveal.)

2351
01:19:54,006 --> 01:19:55,076
No way.

2352
01:19:55,576 --> 01:19:56,845
It's incredibly modern.

2353
01:19:56,846 --> 01:19:58,246
You can do a half-body soak.

2354
01:19:59,546 --> 01:20:00,716
It even smells nice.

2355
01:20:01,786 --> 01:20:03,786
- It smells like wood. - It's warm in here.

2356
01:20:04,586 --> 01:20:06,015
- It's warm. - Why is it warm?

2357
01:20:06,016 --> 01:20:07,625
I could sleep here.

2358
01:20:07,626 --> 01:20:08,655
Same here.

2359
01:20:08,656 --> 01:20:11,296
This hotel is so luxurious.

2360
01:20:11,526 --> 01:20:14,196
(The unexpectedly modern restroom puts them in awe.)

2361
01:20:14,766 --> 01:20:17,236
You guys mostly marvel at the restroom.

2362
01:20:18,436 --> 01:20:20,936
- We didn't expect this style. - No.

2363
01:20:21,766 --> 01:20:23,206
- I love it so much. - Yes.

2364
01:20:23,666 --> 01:20:25,535
It's a way of showing...

2365
01:20:25,536 --> 01:20:27,105
how modern hanok can be.

2366
01:20:27,106 --> 01:20:30,946
Even when you build hanok, the interior design can be modern.

2367
01:20:31,176 --> 01:20:32,875
It can be traditional and modern at the same time.

2368
01:20:32,876 --> 01:20:34,586
This is a possibility.

2369
01:20:34,986 --> 01:20:37,045
I think it'll improve with time.

2370
01:20:37,046 --> 01:20:39,215
Hanok becomes cooler with time.

2371
01:20:39,216 --> 01:20:43,555
If I visit this hotel, I'll have good memories all my life.

2372
01:20:43,556 --> 01:20:45,055
Okay. Let's stay calm.

2373
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:46,095
All right. Give us the question.

2374
01:20:46,096 --> 01:20:47,725
Okay. Here comes the question.

2375
01:20:47,726 --> 01:20:49,695
(It's a quiz that comes with the salted mackerel set.)

2376
01:20:49,696 --> 01:20:51,765
This place is a recreation of the Buyongjeong...

2377
01:20:51,766 --> 01:20:54,706
and Buyongji Pond at the Changdeokgung Palace.

2378
01:20:55,306 --> 01:20:56,465
Right?

2379
01:20:56,466 --> 01:20:59,275
According to the old records, King Jeongjo...

2380
01:20:59,276 --> 01:21:02,305
often gathered around his subjects and enjoyed writing poems...

2381
01:21:02,306 --> 01:21:05,276
on a boat at Buyongji Pond.

2382
01:21:05,376 --> 01:21:06,646
We didn't know that.

2383
01:21:06,846 --> 01:21:10,916
Subjects who couldn't finish writing a poem on time...

2384
01:21:10,986 --> 01:21:14,126
received a punishment of a very brief exile.

2385
01:21:14,756 --> 01:21:16,255
- Hold on. - It's so hard.

2386
01:21:16,256 --> 01:21:17,795
I thought it'd be about the Hahoe Folk Village.

2387
01:21:17,796 --> 01:21:20,255
I memorized so much information I got from ChatGPT.

2388
01:21:20,256 --> 01:21:22,466
To which place were the subjects exiled?

2389
01:21:22,966 --> 01:21:24,266
How are we supposed to know that?

2390
01:21:25,466 --> 01:21:27,666
Hold on. Isn't it a multiple-choice question?

2391
01:21:27,706 --> 01:21:28,836
It's a short-answer question.

2392
01:21:28,866 --> 01:21:31,176
- There are hundreds of regions... - It's so hard.

2393
01:21:31,436 --> 01:21:32,706
In the eight provinces of Korea.

2394
01:21:33,336 --> 01:21:35,645
Hold on. The answer must be within the question.

2395
01:21:35,646 --> 01:21:37,215
Hold on. Let's think about it calmly.

2396
01:21:37,216 --> 01:21:39,345
To be honest, this question is so upsetting.

2397
01:21:39,346 --> 01:21:40,815
- I memorized 20 questions... - It's so hard.

2398
01:21:40,816 --> 01:21:42,015
About the Hahoe Folk Village.

2399
01:21:42,016 --> 01:21:43,545
I learned about the Imae mask.

2400
01:21:43,546 --> 01:21:45,955
I learned that Elizabeth the Second visited the village.

2401
01:21:45,956 --> 01:21:47,986
I talked about it in the car.

2402
01:21:48,086 --> 01:21:49,326
- I memorized everything. - Listen.

2403
01:21:49,356 --> 01:21:50,796
Let's think about it this way.

2404
01:21:51,826 --> 01:21:53,456
- They're poets. - Yes.

2405
01:21:53,596 --> 01:21:55,796
- They're writers. - Yes.

2406
01:21:56,096 --> 01:21:57,166
Then...

2407
01:21:57,596 --> 01:21:58,796
this exile...

2408
01:21:59,196 --> 01:22:00,735
- It can't be something bad. - No.

2409
01:22:00,736 --> 01:22:01,935
I think it's a cute punishment.

2410
01:22:01,936 --> 01:22:04,806
I bet they got sent to a seowon.

2411
01:22:05,176 --> 01:22:06,435
- That sounds strange. - Or...

2412
01:22:06,436 --> 01:22:08,576
- I mean... - No.

2413
01:22:08,976 --> 01:22:10,205
(Sighing)

2414
01:22:10,206 --> 01:22:11,576
What's a seowon?

2415
01:22:11,946 --> 01:22:13,345
(Excuse me?)

2416
01:22:13,346 --> 01:22:15,185
I don't know what it is. What's a seowon?

2417
01:22:15,186 --> 01:22:16,985
- I don't know either. I'm upset. - I'm upset.

2418
01:22:16,986 --> 01:22:18,156
- I'm upset. - What's a seowon?

2419
01:22:19,756 --> 01:22:21,585
Isn't it an academy?

2420
01:22:21,586 --> 01:22:23,255
- That's right. An academy. - People wrote books there.

2421
01:22:23,256 --> 01:22:24,496
An academy?

2422
01:22:25,256 --> 01:22:27,265
Subjects got sent there if they couldn't finish on time.

2423
01:22:27,266 --> 01:22:28,425
- Okay. - Dong Hyun.

2424
01:22:28,426 --> 01:22:30,165
- It's a very brief exile. - I got it.

2425
01:22:30,166 --> 01:22:31,935
I got it.

2426
01:22:31,936 --> 01:22:33,536
- I'll share my opinion. - Okay.

2427
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:35,066
You know,

2428
01:22:35,306 --> 01:22:38,675
I've been to the Secret Garden in the Changdeokgung Palace.

2429
01:22:38,676 --> 01:22:40,005
It looks very similar to this place.

2430
01:22:40,006 --> 01:22:41,306
- Okay. - It's very big.

2431
01:22:41,406 --> 01:22:43,145
There's a building like this one.

2432
01:22:43,146 --> 01:22:45,016
In the middle of the pond, there's an island.

2433
01:22:45,046 --> 01:22:47,945
Behind it, there are a high staircase and a gate.

2434
01:22:47,946 --> 01:22:49,486
It's like that.

2435
01:22:49,586 --> 01:22:50,655
So I think...

2436
01:22:50,656 --> 01:22:52,456
people who lost in the game...

2437
01:22:52,686 --> 01:22:55,085
got exiled to the island...

2438
01:22:55,086 --> 01:22:57,396
- in the middle. - You have my support.

2439
01:22:57,426 --> 01:22:59,355
- You're right. You have a point. - Buyongjeong, Buyongji Pond.

2440
01:22:59,356 --> 01:23:00,865
- Earlier, - Okay.

2441
01:23:00,866 --> 01:23:03,395
He said that they represented the sky and Earth.

2442
01:23:03,396 --> 01:23:04,895
- Flat Earth. - Round Sky and Square Earth.

2443
01:23:04,896 --> 01:23:07,665
- Round Sky and Square Earth. - Round Sky and Square Earth.

2444
01:23:07,666 --> 01:23:09,965
The sky is round and the Earth is square.

2445
01:23:09,966 --> 01:23:11,575
So they got exiled to the island.

2446
01:23:11,576 --> 01:23:13,405
So... Hold on.

2447
01:23:13,406 --> 01:23:15,405
That's the Buyongji Pond, right?

2448
01:23:15,406 --> 01:23:17,145
- Buyongji Pond. - That's the Buyongji Pond.

2449
01:23:17,146 --> 01:23:18,376
- Buyongjeong. - Is that the Buyongjeong?

2450
01:23:18,576 --> 01:23:20,346
- Is that the Buyongjeong? - That's the Buyongjeong.

2451
01:23:20,376 --> 01:23:21,685
It's 1 of the 2.

2452
01:23:21,686 --> 01:23:24,715
There's a high possibility that the answer is the island.

2453
01:23:24,716 --> 01:23:25,855
The second option is...

2454
01:23:25,856 --> 01:23:27,355
the Buyongjeong.

2455
01:23:27,356 --> 01:23:29,126
It's 1 of the 2.

2456
01:23:30,026 --> 01:23:31,526
- "Go to the pavilion." - Yes.

2457
01:23:31,696 --> 01:23:32,855
From the pavilion,

2458
01:23:32,856 --> 01:23:34,395
they would've thought, "We want to play as well."

2459
01:23:34,396 --> 01:23:36,996
- They were exiled to such houses. - That's right.

2460
01:23:37,536 --> 01:23:39,866
Let's run a simulation.

2461
01:23:39,936 --> 01:23:41,766
I got many questions right this way.

2462
01:23:41,806 --> 01:23:43,905
Let's say we're...

2463
01:23:43,906 --> 01:23:45,605
- King Jeongjo. - Okay.

2464
01:23:45,606 --> 01:23:48,305
- We're enjoying... - We're writing a poem like this.

2465
01:23:48,306 --> 01:23:50,045
A relaxing time with our subjects.

2466
01:23:50,046 --> 01:23:51,575
- That's right. - On a boat at the pond,

2467
01:23:51,576 --> 01:23:53,546
we're writing poems.

2468
01:23:53,676 --> 01:23:55,246
Even if someone fails to finish a poem on time,

2469
01:23:55,446 --> 01:23:57,115
- we won't say, "Behead him!" - No.

2470
01:23:57,116 --> 01:23:59,115
- It's for fun. - It's for fun.

2471
01:23:59,116 --> 01:24:01,025
We're King Jeongjo.

2472
01:24:01,026 --> 01:24:03,156
"Write a poem."

2473
01:24:03,356 --> 01:24:05,856
Jae Hyeon did a terrible job.

2474
01:24:05,896 --> 01:24:07,156
"For goodness' sake."

2475
01:24:07,966 --> 01:24:09,425
- Would you send him there? - That's right.

2476
01:24:09,426 --> 01:24:10,835
- I'd send him there. - Same here.

2477
01:24:10,836 --> 01:24:11,935
- Same here. - "Leave him at the island."

2478
01:24:11,936 --> 01:24:14,505
"Hey, we're going home."

2479
01:24:14,506 --> 01:24:16,835
"Your Majesty, it's so cold."

2480
01:24:16,836 --> 01:24:18,835
"You should've done a better job of writing a poem."

2481
01:24:18,836 --> 01:24:20,506
Then I would've left with him on the island.

2482
01:24:20,576 --> 01:24:22,075
I think that's the answer.

2483
01:24:22,076 --> 01:24:23,205
(They think the island is the answer.)

2484
01:24:23,206 --> 01:24:24,316
You know,

2485
01:24:24,346 --> 01:24:26,146
- we're 100 percent sure. - Yes.

2486
01:24:26,846 --> 01:24:29,346
I'm scared that he'll say, "Incorrect."

2487
01:24:29,546 --> 01:24:32,085
There are times we get...

2488
01:24:32,086 --> 01:24:34,785
- a cute question like this one. - Okay.

2489
01:24:34,786 --> 01:24:35,985
All right. Let's give our answer.

2490
01:24:35,986 --> 01:24:37,425
- It has to be right. - Yes.

2491
01:24:37,426 --> 01:24:38,755
- Let me answer. - Let's go.

2492
01:24:38,756 --> 01:24:40,995
You were holding this during the last quiz, right?

2493
01:24:40,996 --> 01:24:42,425
- Hold it again. - Let's make it a routine.

2494
01:24:42,426 --> 01:24:44,295
- We need to switch positions. - How?

2495
01:24:44,296 --> 01:24:45,435
Okay.

2496
01:24:45,436 --> 01:24:46,965
Jae Hyeon, say the answer.

2497
01:24:46,966 --> 01:24:48,505
- Let me answer. - What's the answer?

2498
01:24:48,506 --> 01:24:49,806
(Hesitant)

2499
01:24:50,066 --> 01:24:51,675
- It's okay. Trust me. - Is it correct?

2500
01:24:51,676 --> 01:24:53,835
- I'm 100 percent sure. - In front of the Buyongji Pond...

2501
01:24:53,836 --> 01:24:56,246
- It's in the Buyongji Pond. - It's in the Buyongji Pond.

2502
01:24:57,776 --> 01:25:00,445
To the small island,

2503
01:25:00,446 --> 01:25:02,515
the subjects were sent on a brief exile.

2504
01:25:02,516 --> 01:25:04,786
(A small island in Buyongji Pond)

2505
01:25:05,086 --> 01:25:06,086
That's your answer.

2506
01:25:06,087 --> 01:25:09,785
(Is it the right answer?)

2507
01:25:09,786 --> 01:25:10,796
Correct.

2508
01:25:10,896 --> 01:25:12,625
- That's the answer? - Correct!

2509
01:25:12,626 --> 01:25:14,326
(Correct!)

2510
01:25:14,526 --> 01:25:15,595
(The answer that Dong Hyun put together)

2511
01:25:15,596 --> 01:25:16,625
Gosh!

2512
01:25:16,626 --> 01:25:18,365
(The answer that Dong Hyun put together)

2513
01:25:18,366 --> 01:25:20,166
He's announcing it with a new routine.

2514
01:25:20,196 --> 01:25:22,436
"Correct. Correct!"

2515
01:25:22,806 --> 01:25:23,835
(Touched)

2516
01:25:23,836 --> 01:25:24,936
That was the answer!

2517
01:25:26,036 --> 01:25:27,105
I remember seeing this.

2518
01:25:27,106 --> 01:25:28,446
What's the exact answer?

2519
01:25:29,576 --> 01:25:31,515
(You have failed to meet my promise.)

2520
01:25:31,516 --> 01:25:33,015
(You will be banished!)

2521
01:25:33,016 --> 01:25:34,046
What?

2522
01:25:34,216 --> 01:25:35,815
A boat was set on the pond...

2523
01:25:35,816 --> 01:25:37,216
and he was banished...

2524
01:25:38,156 --> 01:25:39,316
to the small island.

2525
01:25:40,156 --> 01:25:41,826
- Hope is upon us. - Gosh, Dong Hyun.

2526
01:25:42,526 --> 01:25:43,826
Saving Private Jae Hyeon.

2527
01:25:44,326 --> 01:25:46,225
We've made a lot of progress.

2528
01:25:46,226 --> 01:25:47,825
Seriously, Dong Hyun.

2529
01:25:47,826 --> 01:25:48,925
We would've never thought about that answer.

2530
01:25:48,926 --> 01:25:49,995
This is amazing.

2531
01:25:49,996 --> 01:25:51,166
You got it right.

2532
01:25:51,636 --> 01:25:52,966
- As we have mentioned, - Right.

2533
01:25:53,436 --> 01:25:56,565
You will be served with the grilled salted mackerel meal.

2534
01:25:56,566 --> 01:25:57,676
- Sounds great. - Right.

2535
01:25:57,836 --> 01:25:59,606
- Shall we move? - Yes.

2536
01:25:59,776 --> 01:26:00,876
I'm ready to eat.

2537
01:26:01,246 --> 01:26:02,776
One, two, three.

2538
01:26:02,906 --> 01:26:04,615
- Buyongji! - Buyongji!

2539
01:26:04,616 --> 01:26:05,715
Don't banish me!

2540
01:26:05,716 --> 01:26:07,175
(Current score, Team Handsome versus Team Guys)

2541
01:26:07,176 --> 01:26:08,646
(1 to 2)

2542
01:26:08,916 --> 01:26:10,955
(We would like to offer words of consolation...)

2543
01:26:10,956 --> 01:26:12,985
(to those who have greatly suffered from the forest fire.)

2544
01:26:12,986 --> 01:26:14,756
(We pray for a quick recovery and restoration to the areas affected.)

2545
01:26:14,986 --> 01:26:17,855
(Handsome Guys will now air on Thursdays at 8:40pm.)

2546
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:20,455
(Viewers who love Handsome Guys, )

2547
01:26:20,456 --> 01:26:22,796
(we'll see you on April 17!)

2548
01:26:23,304 --> 01:26:25,604
(It isn't over yet.)

2549
01:26:26,074 --> 01:26:29,244
(Amazed)

2550
01:26:29,874 --> 01:26:33,914
(North Gyeongsang Province Architecture Race)

2551
01:26:34,784 --> 01:26:36,244
(Everyone has fallen for it.)

2552
01:26:36,644 --> 01:26:38,684
(This is it.)

2553
01:26:39,554 --> 01:26:43,084
(North Gyeongsang Province's amazing food)

2554
01:26:43,884 --> 01:26:45,093
(Eating...)

2555
01:26:45,094 --> 01:26:46,353
(and eating again)

2556
01:26:46,354 --> 01:26:47,824
(Eating endlessly)

2557
01:26:48,594 --> 01:26:50,464
(Even small eater Tae Hyun finishes the whole pot!)

2558
01:26:50,864 --> 01:26:52,594
(As they've eaten a lot, )

2559
01:26:53,364 --> 01:26:54,764
(it's time for the important quiz time.)

2560
01:26:55,004 --> 01:26:56,863
(I can't do this.)

2561
01:26:56,864 --> 01:26:58,903
(Team Guys doesn't have the reattempt card.)

2562
01:26:58,904 --> 01:27:00,733
(They are avoiding to be responsible for the quiz for 30 minutes.)

2563
01:27:00,734 --> 01:27:02,473
(Someone should take responsibility!)

2564
01:27:02,474 --> 01:27:03,573
(The discipline of Seoul Institute of the Arts...)

2565
01:27:03,574 --> 01:27:04,713
(has really weakened.)

2566
01:27:04,714 --> 01:27:06,444
(Must it be done with acting?)

2567
01:27:06,644 --> 01:27:08,943
(With the pride of Seoul Institute of the Arts on the line)

2568
01:27:08,944 --> 01:27:10,243
(I gave it all to the pine tree.)

2569
01:27:10,244 --> 01:27:11,553
(The pine tree?)

2570
01:27:11,554 --> 01:27:14,254
(Si Eon hard carries Team Handsome with his great acting.)

2571
01:27:14,454 --> 01:27:15,724
(It can't end like this!)

2572
01:27:16,184 --> 01:27:17,283
(Just like an answer detector)

2573
01:27:17,284 --> 01:27:18,594
(I'm 100 percent certain.)

2574
01:27:18,894 --> 01:27:21,563
(The members of Team Guys get together for victory.)

2575
01:27:21,564 --> 01:27:22,663
- One, two, three. - One, two, three.

2576
01:27:22,664 --> 01:27:23,694
(Team Guys strikes back!)

2577
01:27:23,894 --> 01:27:24,894
(I'm going to go home now.)

2578
01:27:24,895 --> 01:27:26,263
(Will we lose if you get the last one right?)

2579
01:27:26,264 --> 01:27:28,163
(Without the reattempt card, )

2580
01:27:28,164 --> 01:27:29,164
(we made it this far!)

2581
01:27:29,604 --> 01:27:32,534
(There's a big twist in the end?)

2582
01:27:33,234 --> 01:27:36,644
(How will this race end?)

2583
01:27:38,144 --> 01:27:41,614
("Dangerous" by INFINITE)
