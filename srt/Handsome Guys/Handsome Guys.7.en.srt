1
00:00:30,094 --> 00:00:32,604
(Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province, 7:30am)

2
00:00:33,063 --> 00:00:36,003
(A freezing day after the snowfall)

3
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:38,143
Why does everyone have an ear warmer?

4
00:00:38,643 --> 00:00:41,043
- What?
- Everyone's wearing an ear warmer.

5
00:00:41,343 --> 00:00:42,612
- It's very cold.
- By the way...

6
00:00:42,613 --> 00:00:44,743
Since it's cold today, don't get on my nerves.

7
00:00:44,744 --> 00:00:46,714
How cold could it possibly get?

8
00:00:46,883 --> 00:00:47,982
I should jog.

9
00:00:47,983 --> 00:00:49,014
Really?

10
00:00:49,514 --> 00:00:50,783
(Independence Hall of Korea)

11
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,284
- It looks amazing here.
- It's enormous.

12
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:56,493
I think Yu Gwan Sun's hometown is Cheonan.

13
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:59,923
- Hello.
- Hello.

14
00:00:59,993 --> 00:01:00,993
It's cold.

15
00:01:00,994 --> 00:01:02,863
Sang Uk lost a lot of weight.

16
00:01:02,864 --> 00:01:04,433
- I lost a lot of weight.
- He's not in season yet,

17
00:01:04,434 --> 00:01:05,763
but he lost weight because of Yi Kyung.

18
00:01:05,764 --> 00:01:07,573
It's because of Yi Kyung. On the first day...

19
00:01:07,574 --> 00:01:09,533
Yi Kyung said that I gained weight.

20
00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:12,044
During the first episode, I asked him if it was off-season.

21
00:01:13,644 --> 00:01:15,342
It's in season now.

22
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:16,374
Right.

23
00:01:17,213 --> 00:01:18,843
Seung Ho, tell us what you've been up to.

24
00:01:19,184 --> 00:01:20,683
It hasn't changed.

25
00:01:20,684 --> 00:01:22,213
- There's nothing special.
- Nothing?

26
00:01:22,313 --> 00:01:23,413
Why not?

27
00:01:23,614 --> 00:01:25,522
The look on his face changed completely...

28
00:01:25,523 --> 00:01:27,352
compared to Episode One.

29
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,022
- He became a different person.
- He looks much better now.

30
00:01:29,023 --> 00:01:31,723
In the beginning, he was always making a face.

31
00:01:31,724 --> 00:01:33,493
- Now, he looks happier.
- He looks much better.

32
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:34,693
I realized...

33
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:37,033
that I need to sleep well the night before the shoot.

34
00:01:37,034 --> 00:01:38,432
- Did you sleep well?
- I did.

35
00:01:38,433 --> 00:01:39,533
- You slept well?
- Yes.

36
00:01:39,534 --> 00:01:40,833
(Refreshed: 0.9, Happy: 0.1, Sad: 0, Surprised: 0, Anger: 0)

37
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:42,803
Are we in South Chungcheong Province today?

38
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:44,542
We're at the Independence Hall...

39
00:01:44,543 --> 00:01:45,772
in Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province.

40
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:48,513
This is a famous tourist attraction.

41
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:51,143
- Now...
- It looks magnificent.

42
00:01:51,144 --> 00:01:52,912
It looks so amazing here.

43
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:54,253
It's really big.

44
00:01:54,254 --> 00:01:55,413
(Statue of Indomitable Koreans)

45
00:01:55,653 --> 00:01:57,122
Independence Hall of Korea opened...

46
00:01:57,123 --> 00:01:59,182
on August 15, 1987...

47
00:01:59,183 --> 00:02:01,253
to remember the historical value and spirit...

48
00:02:01,254 --> 00:02:03,894
of Korean independence movement.

49
00:02:06,023 --> 00:02:07,632
Does anyone have connection...

50
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:08,932
to South Chungcheong Province?

51
00:02:08,933 --> 00:02:10,262
It's Sang Uk's hometown.

52
00:02:10,263 --> 00:02:12,662
- Didn't you come from Daejeon?
- It took an hour from Daejeon.

53
00:02:12,663 --> 00:02:14,402
- We took 1.5 hours.
- It took exactly 1 hour.

54
00:02:14,403 --> 00:02:16,003
All my schools were in Daejeon.

55
00:02:16,004 --> 00:02:17,402
- Where?
- It's practically my hometown.

56
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:18,473
- Daejeon?
- Yes.

57
00:02:18,474 --> 00:02:21,174
My father is from Dangjin.

58
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:23,144
The place of my family register is Buyeo, South Chungcheong Province.

59
00:02:23,474 --> 00:02:25,242
- Everyone is...
- My grandparents live in Buyeo.

60
00:02:25,243 --> 00:02:26,542
What about you? Say something.

61
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:27,983
Do you have family here? Your parents?

62
00:02:27,984 --> 00:02:29,053
He's making a face again.

63
00:02:29,054 --> 00:02:30,054
(He's not angry. He's just thinking.)

64
00:02:30,055 --> 00:02:31,382
He's making a face again?

65
00:02:31,383 --> 00:02:32,554
I...

66
00:02:33,523 --> 00:02:34,523
You don't have any connection?

67
00:02:34,524 --> 00:02:36,794
Let me think about it. I'll let you know during the closing segment.

68
00:02:37,093 --> 00:02:39,264
- I need some time to think.
- All right.

69
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:42,163
A guest will join you today...

70
00:02:42,164 --> 00:02:44,104
- to visit Handsome Heritage.
- Okay.

71
00:02:44,503 --> 00:02:46,433
- Please come out.
- We have a guest.

72
00:02:46,503 --> 00:02:48,174
(Where is he coming from?)

73
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,002
(Where is our guest?)

74
00:02:51,003 --> 00:02:52,044
Gosh.

75
00:02:52,174 --> 00:02:53,743
He could've come out from here.

76
00:02:54,144 --> 00:02:55,174
Why is he coming from afar?

77
00:02:56,114 --> 00:02:57,914
He was too far away.

78
00:02:59,584 --> 00:03:03,014
(Flapping)

79
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:06,783
(They can't react because they can't see who it is.)

80
00:03:07,924 --> 00:03:09,324
He looks like a model.

81
00:03:11,193 --> 00:03:12,363
He didn't dress warmly enough.

82
00:03:12,364 --> 00:03:13,463
I don't recognize him yet.

83
00:03:13,723 --> 00:03:14,734
It's cold.

84
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:16,633
(Shivering)

85
00:03:16,634 --> 00:03:18,734
- It's cold.
- He clearly looks weak.

86
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:21,634
(Weak? No way.)

87
00:03:21,704 --> 00:03:23,372
- He doesn't know how to punch.
- Seriously.

88
00:03:23,373 --> 00:03:24,373
(Exclaiming)

89
00:03:24,374 --> 00:03:26,043
- He's never boxed before.
- Seriously.

90
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:27,743
- He doesn't know how to punch.
- What is he doing?

91
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:30,273
- What's that?
- It's Jae Hyeon.

92
00:03:30,414 --> 00:03:32,312
(Actor Ahn Jae Hyeon)

93
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:33,384
Hello.

94
00:03:33,514 --> 00:03:35,113
- He's one of our kind.
- Hello.

95
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,613
He's my pupil.

96
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:37,953
He's my workout pupil.

97
00:03:37,954 --> 00:03:39,182
- Really?
- I taught him.

98
00:03:39,183 --> 00:03:40,522
- Are you training him now?
- No.

99
00:03:40,523 --> 00:03:41,893
- I taught him once a long time ago.
- In the past?

100
00:03:41,894 --> 00:03:43,492
- Didn't I teach you once?
- Hello.

101
00:03:43,493 --> 00:03:44,562
- Jae Hyeon.
- Hello.

102
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:45,824
Aren't you cold in that outfit?

103
00:03:46,164 --> 00:03:47,294
I'm freezing.

104
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,794
It's very cold.

105
00:03:49,193 --> 00:03:50,502
Will you be okay today?

106
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:51,703
I thought that...

107
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:53,403
we'd get in the car right away.

108
00:03:53,804 --> 00:03:55,503
Why is the opening segment so long?

109
00:03:56,204 --> 00:03:57,643
It's shorter than usual because it's cold today.

110
00:03:57,644 --> 00:03:58,644
- Really?
- Yes.

111
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,742
You look very young.

112
00:04:00,743 --> 00:04:02,442
I was surprised to find out that you're older than Yi Kyung.

113
00:04:02,443 --> 00:04:03,983
- Really?
- He's older than me.

114
00:04:03,984 --> 00:04:04,984
- You look the youngest among us.
- Really?

115
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:06,342
I'm one year older than Yi Kyung.

116
00:04:06,343 --> 00:04:08,253
We were in "My Love From the Star."

117
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,782
What did you think of our show?

118
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,083
Among the questions we got,

119
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,752
did you know the answer to any of them?

120
00:04:12,753 --> 00:04:14,152
We could get unlucky.

121
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:16,523
- Really?
- Did you know any of them?

122
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:19,663
- At our level...
- Are you bad with quizzes?

123
00:04:19,664 --> 00:04:21,793
I remember many of the problems,

124
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,193
but I didn't get any of them right.

125
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:24,933
(He failed all.)

126
00:04:25,364 --> 00:04:28,604
- Good, he's exactly on our level.
- I didn't get any of them.

127
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:30,303
(I see.)

128
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:31,372
No way.

129
00:04:31,373 --> 00:04:33,674
Today, it will be...

130
00:04:33,704 --> 00:04:34,943
three against three.

131
00:04:35,373 --> 00:04:39,212
Three smart guys against three guys who aren't smart.

132
00:04:39,213 --> 00:04:40,913
Who aren't the smart ones?

133
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,082
Jae Hyeon isn't smart?

134
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,253
I think so.

135
00:04:44,354 --> 00:04:46,024
That was a great comment.

136
00:04:46,554 --> 00:04:48,253
- He isn't smart.
- I can tell...

137
00:04:48,294 --> 00:04:49,854
from the look in his eyes.

138
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:53,093
(Today's theme)

139
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:55,734
(South Chungcheong Province, the middle of the country)

140
00:04:56,734 --> 00:04:59,202
(Including treasures of Baekje...)

141
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:00,404
(with a long history)

142
00:05:02,003 --> 00:05:04,843
(And...)

143
00:05:04,844 --> 00:05:08,674
(the painful past of Korea)

144
00:05:10,274 --> 00:05:13,284
(Where the history is still alive)

145
00:05:14,883 --> 00:05:18,024
(Today's Handsome Heritage, cultural assets of South Chungcheong)

146
00:05:18,224 --> 00:05:19,424
(South Chungcheong Province that everyone's proud of)

147
00:05:20,794 --> 00:05:22,554
Will there be good food today?

148
00:05:23,094 --> 00:05:24,392
Like brainiacs,

149
00:05:24,393 --> 00:05:27,293
I'd love to complete the bingo and finish.

150
00:05:27,294 --> 00:05:29,864
There might be kalguksu in Gongju.

151
00:05:30,633 --> 00:05:34,202
Look, there are Buyeo A and B.

152
00:05:34,203 --> 00:05:36,202
- There are Yesan A and B.
- You're right.

153
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:37,543
(There are two spots in Yesan and Buyeo.)

154
00:05:37,544 --> 00:05:39,573
You can win two in either Buyeo or Yesan.

155
00:05:41,214 --> 00:05:42,242
I want to see...

156
00:05:42,243 --> 00:05:43,312
- the War Diary of Yi Sun Sin.
- The War Diary of Yi Sun Sin.

157
00:05:43,313 --> 00:05:44,343
(Certified in Korean history)

158
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,484
Me too.

159
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:48,383
Dr. Yun Bong Gil is known for his boxed meal bomb.

160
00:05:48,414 --> 00:05:49,883
Do you know any of them, Jae Hyeon?

161
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,593
I'm not sure.

162
00:05:54,594 --> 00:05:55,594
(It won't be easy.)

163
00:05:55,595 --> 00:05:57,192
You might be worse than me.

164
00:05:57,193 --> 00:05:58,363
(In awe)

165
00:05:58,364 --> 00:05:59,364
He could be worse than me.

166
00:05:59,563 --> 00:06:00,864
I should avoid him on my team.

167
00:06:01,493 --> 00:06:03,392
(They're starting to make fun of the guest.)

168
00:06:03,393 --> 00:06:05,534
Won't Jae Hyeon pick the teams today?

169
00:06:05,804 --> 00:06:07,303
- What?
- Yes, he will.

170
00:06:07,304 --> 00:06:08,774
Usually, the guest picks his team members.

171
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,274
I thought about it before coming here.

172
00:06:13,143 --> 00:06:15,714
- I have two on my mind.
- Really?

173
00:06:15,813 --> 00:06:17,743
- Two?
- Hold on, really?

174
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:20,343
(Tongue-tied)

175
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:22,853
I have their names on my mind.

176
00:06:22,854 --> 00:06:23,983
Don't you need recommendations?

177
00:06:23,984 --> 00:06:25,854
- I can recommend you.
- No.

178
00:06:26,123 --> 00:06:27,294
Let me recommend you.

179
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:29,423
Keep those two names...

180
00:06:29,424 --> 00:06:30,594
in mind.

181
00:06:30,664 --> 00:06:32,963
To help you pick your teammates,

182
00:06:32,964 --> 00:06:34,594
- here are the chance cards.
- Okay.

183
00:06:35,034 --> 00:06:36,093
You'll pick them first.

184
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:38,002
Right, we should pick them first.

185
00:06:38,003 --> 00:06:39,332
(Pick us based on our card.)

186
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,034
- Don't look at it yet.
- I won't.

187
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:45,202
We can't look at it yet?

188
00:06:45,203 --> 00:06:49,073
(The card to determine their team)

189
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,043
As you can tell,

190
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,414
there are different hints.

191
00:06:53,683 --> 00:06:56,113
The best is the reattempt card.

192
00:06:56,114 --> 00:06:57,114
Do you have a reattempt card?

193
00:06:57,115 --> 00:06:58,822
I may have a reattempt card.

194
00:06:58,823 --> 00:06:59,823
(Of course, I do.)

195
00:06:59,824 --> 00:07:00,952
He's bad at lying.

196
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:02,992
- Why would the guest...
- He's bad at it.

197
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:04,822
Who are the two you had...

198
00:07:04,823 --> 00:07:06,293
- Who are the two you had in mind?
- in mind?

199
00:07:06,294 --> 00:07:08,062
This was my plan.

200
00:07:08,063 --> 00:07:09,464
- What?
- Three Hyeon's.

201
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:11,804
- Three Hyeon's?
- Ahn Jae Hyeon,

202
00:07:12,063 --> 00:07:13,464
Cha Tae Hyun, and Kim Dong Hyun.

203
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:16,303
- Three Hyun's?
- Three Hyun's?

204
00:07:16,304 --> 00:07:20,143
I imagined us together like old boys.

205
00:07:20,813 --> 00:07:22,012
- By the way, - That was my plan.

206
00:07:22,013 --> 00:07:24,413
you have to choose wisely.

207
00:07:24,414 --> 00:07:26,043
Whatever the case,

208
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:27,784
- I'll follow my plan.
- Really?

209
00:07:28,484 --> 00:07:29,484
(Surprised)

210
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:31,583
What's wrong with you?

211
00:07:31,654 --> 00:07:32,654
Go to that side.

212
00:07:32,655 --> 00:07:34,023
- Okay.
- You have no reattempt card, right?

213
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:35,053
- Hurry up.
- Dong Hyun.

214
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:36,752
- You don't have it, do you?
- I have a reattempt card.

215
00:07:36,753 --> 00:07:37,964
- Really?
- Yes.

216
00:07:38,823 --> 00:07:39,992
Goodness.

217
00:07:39,993 --> 00:07:41,333
Do you have a good one?

218
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:44,534
- That's fine.
- It's not bad.

219
00:07:44,703 --> 00:07:47,304
I've never seen this card before.

220
00:07:47,534 --> 00:07:49,733
- What's this free shampoo card?
- A shampoo card?

221
00:07:49,734 --> 00:07:51,002
- What is it?
- Shampoo?

222
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:54,413
As it says, one of you has to get your hair shampooed...

223
00:07:54,414 --> 00:07:56,113
before the end of the show.

224
00:07:56,114 --> 00:07:57,812
- They have to wash their hair?
- Shampoo?

225
00:07:57,813 --> 00:07:58,843
- Where?
- What is this?

226
00:07:58,844 --> 00:08:00,442
Can't you get your hair shampooed...

227
00:08:00,443 --> 00:08:01,753
- at a hair salon?
- Goodness.

228
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:03,682
Can we get it at a hair salon?

229
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,853
Yes, get your hair shampooed somewhere.

230
00:08:06,854 --> 00:08:08,054
It came out of nowhere.

231
00:08:08,294 --> 00:08:09,593
What's yours?

232
00:08:09,594 --> 00:08:11,563
- I have a reattempt card.
- Okay!

233
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:13,493
I'm sorry.

234
00:08:13,494 --> 00:08:15,863
- Okay!
- What is it?

235
00:08:15,864 --> 00:08:17,502
Don't say anything.

236
00:08:17,503 --> 00:08:19,464
- Why?
- Just don't say anything.

237
00:08:19,604 --> 00:08:21,072
Don't say anything.

238
00:08:21,073 --> 00:08:22,103
(They obviously have 2 reattempt cards.)

239
00:08:22,104 --> 00:08:24,442
The reattempt card is the best, and if they have two...

240
00:08:24,443 --> 00:08:25,473
So you were lying.

241
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:26,643
I don't lie.

242
00:08:27,003 --> 00:08:29,273
- They must have...
- Wishing happy birthday card.

243
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:30,613
- What else?
- The nap card.

244
00:08:30,614 --> 00:08:32,813
- I have a nap card.
- They'll put us to sleep.

245
00:08:32,883 --> 00:08:34,854
- I have a GPS card.
- What's that?

246
00:08:35,253 --> 00:08:37,653
The reattempt card is the best.

247
00:08:37,654 --> 00:08:40,524
- Let's complete the bingo today.
- Okay.

248
00:08:40,823 --> 00:08:43,392
As you know, we're going to Nonsan.

249
00:08:43,393 --> 00:08:44,663
(We'll go to Nonsan in the center.)

250
00:08:44,664 --> 00:08:46,224
Do you want to sleep as soon as we start?

251
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,093
They have the nap card.

252
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:49,832
- They have the nap card.
- Tae Hyun.

253
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:51,733
- It won't work.
- Do you want to sleep?

254
00:08:51,734 --> 00:08:54,303
As always, you have until 7pm tonight.

255
00:08:54,304 --> 00:08:55,503
- Okay.
- It's 7pm.

256
00:08:55,674 --> 00:08:58,603
The losing team will get a penalty.

257
00:08:58,874 --> 00:09:00,103
The penalty is temple stay.

258
00:09:00,544 --> 00:09:01,744
That's the penalty?

259
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:04,514
(Fighting against sleep at the crack of dawn)

260
00:09:05,414 --> 00:09:09,483
(Practices to empty one's mind)

261
00:09:11,124 --> 00:09:13,853
(A chance to cultivate one's body and mind)

262
00:09:16,024 --> 00:09:18,794
(It will be a rare experience.)

263
00:09:18,823 --> 00:09:20,993
You know that you get up at 5am during the temple stay, right?

264
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:22,193
You can barely sleep there.

265
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:24,562
Before you start,

266
00:09:24,563 --> 00:09:26,763
there's a place in Cheonan...

267
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:28,303
It's the top square on the right side.

268
00:09:28,304 --> 00:09:31,103
It's Exhibition of Japanese Government Building Remains.

269
00:09:31,674 --> 00:09:34,374
It's located inside the Independence Hall.

270
00:09:35,343 --> 00:09:37,342
So you can get there by foot.

271
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:40,044
(The important information makes their eyes roll quickly.)

272
00:09:40,953 --> 00:09:42,112
Let's talk about this beforehand.

273
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:44,482
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- This one or Nonsan?

274
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,722
- Let's decide beforehand.
- Play rock-paper-scissors.

275
00:09:46,723 --> 00:09:47,723
This is very close.

276
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:49,153
Tae Hyun, do you still want the center...

277
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:50,253
or this place?

278
00:09:50,254 --> 00:09:51,562
(The center or here?)

279
00:09:51,563 --> 00:09:52,823
We must go here.

280
00:09:53,164 --> 00:09:54,294
No matter what.

281
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:56,092
Tae Hyun, you don't want to go here?

282
00:09:56,093 --> 00:09:58,362
We should at least pretend to go here...

283
00:09:58,363 --> 00:10:00,874
to prevent them from using the nap card at a crucial moment.

284
00:10:01,203 --> 00:10:02,203
(Team Guys is busy discussing their plans.)

285
00:10:02,204 --> 00:10:04,244
They'll either go here or there.

286
00:10:04,274 --> 00:10:06,804
If we decide to go here, we must go.

287
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:10,273
(Quietly,)

288
00:10:10,274 --> 00:10:12,244
(Team Handsome is leaving.)

289
00:10:12,644 --> 00:10:15,682
(Crazy Gamer is busy talking.)

290
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:17,553
- Are they leaving?
- We'll use the nap card.

291
00:10:17,554 --> 00:10:19,423
Call out "start."

292
00:10:19,424 --> 00:10:20,783
- We used the nap card.
- What?

293
00:10:20,784 --> 00:10:22,053
We used the nap card.

294
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,493
No, you didn't.

295
00:10:23,494 --> 00:10:25,294
It's not time yet. It's still morning.

296
00:10:25,463 --> 00:10:26,494
We used it.

297
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:28,664
Let's play a game instead.

298
00:10:28,733 --> 00:10:30,763
Let's have the winner of the game take it.

299
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:32,303
- No.
- Or play rock-paper-scissors.

300
00:10:32,304 --> 00:10:34,102
They want to play a game. If they win,

301
00:10:34,103 --> 00:10:36,633
- they'll put us to sleep and leave.
- Right.

302
00:10:36,634 --> 00:10:39,073
- Let's decide with a game.
- No way.

303
00:10:39,103 --> 00:10:40,503
- No way.
- No.

304
00:10:40,504 --> 00:10:42,374
- Should we run too?
- Run.

305
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:43,473
- The nap...
- How...

306
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,442
We should know where we're going.

307
00:10:45,443 --> 00:10:46,544
Wait.

308
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:48,554
We should know where we're going.

309
00:10:48,853 --> 00:10:51,183
Wait, we need to know where it is.

310
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,722
- Tae Hyun, just tell us.
- What?

311
00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:54,222
- Just tell us.
- Tell you what?

312
00:10:54,223 --> 00:10:55,893
Let's decide before leaving.

313
00:10:55,894 --> 00:10:57,423
We don't know where we're going.

314
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,223
What was the place called?

315
00:10:59,963 --> 00:11:00,993
What was it called?

316
00:11:00,994 --> 00:11:02,832
(No one knows where the destination is.)

317
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:04,563
What was the place called?

318
00:11:05,603 --> 00:11:06,963
- Hey.
- Is it this way?

319
00:11:07,504 --> 00:11:08,633
Is it this way?

320
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,904
How do we enter?

321
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:13,473
What are we doing so early in the morning?

322
00:11:14,343 --> 00:11:16,174
- It's cold.
- I'm running out of breath.

323
00:11:16,943 --> 00:11:18,244
- By the way...
- Goodness.

324
00:11:18,313 --> 00:11:20,183
- What are we doing?
- If we play, you won't make us nap?

325
00:11:20,414 --> 00:11:21,483
No.

326
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:23,452
Let's play a game.

327
00:11:23,453 --> 00:11:24,482
(Yi Kyung suggests playing a game again.)

328
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:25,783
- What?
- Let's play a game.

329
00:11:25,784 --> 00:11:26,923
- Tae Hyun.
- I'm out of breath.

330
00:11:26,924 --> 00:11:28,352
- If we play a game, - Where...

331
00:11:28,353 --> 00:11:29,494
he won't use the nap card.

332
00:11:29,593 --> 00:11:31,393
What is the place called?

333
00:11:31,394 --> 00:11:32,463
I mean...

334
00:11:32,764 --> 00:11:33,793
We should get going.

335
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:36,063
- Let's play a game.
- Where is it?

336
00:11:36,134 --> 00:11:37,634
- I'm out of breath.
- Where is the place?

337
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:40,102
(Is he going to the restroom?)

338
00:11:40,103 --> 00:11:42,103
Jae Hyeon isn't going to the restroom.

339
00:11:43,274 --> 00:11:44,873
Jae Hyeon isn't going to the restroom.

340
00:11:44,874 --> 00:11:45,973
Excuse me, sir.

341
00:11:46,343 --> 00:11:47,843
May I ask for directions?

342
00:11:47,943 --> 00:11:50,572
Where is the Exhibition of Japanese Government Building Remains?

343
00:11:50,573 --> 00:11:52,413
You have to go downstairs...

344
00:11:52,414 --> 00:11:54,082
and go to the side.

345
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,413
How far down?

346
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:57,413
- You'll see a research lab.
- Okay.

347
00:11:57,414 --> 00:12:00,352
Keep going down and turn this way.

348
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:01,793
Okay, thank you.

349
00:12:01,794 --> 00:12:06,723
(Jae Hyeon figures out the spot in Cheonan.)

350
00:12:07,294 --> 00:12:10,062
(Jae Hyeon is heading in the right direction.)

351
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:14,374
(Exhibition of Japanese Government Building Remains)

352
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:18,643
(Waiting for the members at the spot)

353
00:12:18,644 --> 00:12:22,144
(Mr. Curator)

354
00:12:22,573 --> 00:12:23,773
We don't even know its name.

355
00:12:23,774 --> 00:12:26,082
- What is it called?
- We're just going in circles.

356
00:12:26,083 --> 00:12:28,253
- The light is so bright.
- It's on the scoreboard.

357
00:12:28,254 --> 00:12:31,123
It's Jae Hyeon who has the scoreboard.

358
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:32,952
Japanese Government Building.

359
00:12:32,953 --> 00:12:34,423
Jae Hyeon, let's play a game.

360
00:12:34,424 --> 00:12:36,523
Jae Hyeon, ask them right now.

361
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:37,592
Japanese Government Building...

362
00:12:37,593 --> 00:12:39,163
Is it Japanese Government Building Remains?

363
00:12:39,164 --> 00:12:40,723
- Catching Jae Hyeon will be faster.
- Remains?

364
00:12:40,823 --> 00:12:42,732
- We went in a circle.
- Where's Seung Ho?

365
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:43,894
Where's Seung Ho?

366
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,404
What?

367
00:12:45,563 --> 00:12:47,462
- There it is. Tae Hyun.
- What?

368
00:12:47,463 --> 00:12:48,803
- There's a map.
- Okay.

369
00:12:48,804 --> 00:12:49,874
Here's the map.

370
00:12:49,973 --> 00:12:51,303
- Japanese Government Building.
- Here it is.

371
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:54,674
- Where is it? Where's that?
- It's number 22.

372
00:12:55,014 --> 00:12:56,812
It's here. Hey, it's outside.

373
00:12:56,813 --> 00:12:58,514
Hold on. Where's number 22?

374
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,812
- Hey, what's this?
- Where are we?

375
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,113
- We're here.
- We're here.

376
00:13:02,154 --> 00:13:06,183
(Exhibition of Japanese Government Building Remains, current location)

377
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:09,294
We need to go right.

378
00:13:09,894 --> 00:13:11,293
We need to go right.

379
00:13:11,294 --> 00:13:12,822
- Right. It's that way.
- It's this way.

380
00:13:12,823 --> 00:13:14,593
- It's that way.
- It's this way.

381
00:13:14,693 --> 00:13:16,893
- It's this way. Tae Hyun.
- What?

382
00:13:16,894 --> 00:13:18,803
Why would you go that way?

383
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:20,033
We're here.

384
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:22,004
- Can't you see that? It's this way.
- This way?

385
00:13:22,374 --> 00:13:23,832
Why aren't they coming?

386
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,842
(We need to hurry up and go. Why aren't they coming.)

387
00:13:26,843 --> 00:13:29,043
- This way.
- Yes. We go out for number 22.

388
00:13:29,044 --> 00:13:30,143
- Where is it?
- We go out for number 22.

389
00:13:30,144 --> 00:13:32,413
Let's hurry up and go. Hurry up.

390
00:13:32,414 --> 00:13:33,513
Okay. Hey.

391
00:13:33,514 --> 00:13:35,313
We'll get there first.

392
00:13:36,284 --> 00:13:37,923
We just need to get Tae Hyun.

393
00:13:37,924 --> 00:13:39,783
If it looks like we're behind,

394
00:13:39,784 --> 00:13:42,494
let's put them to sleep here. We need to do that.

395
00:13:43,453 --> 00:13:46,123
- Dong Hyun.
- Yes?

396
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:50,093
(Signaling for the spot behind Team Guys members' backs)

397
00:13:50,134 --> 00:13:52,432
Jae Hyeon, let's go to the car.

398
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:54,433
- It's cold, right? Let's do that.
- It'll be better than staying here.

399
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,333
- Let's go to the car.
- The car.

400
00:13:57,174 --> 00:13:58,673
Do we have to take this square?

401
00:13:58,674 --> 00:13:59,842
Where are you guys going?

402
00:13:59,843 --> 00:14:01,842
We're going to the car to warm our hands.

403
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:02,943
Don't run!

404
00:14:02,973 --> 00:14:04,273
I'll follow them and put them to sleep...

405
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:05,582
if it looks like we'll lose.

406
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:06,813
Shall we look for it?

407
00:14:07,884 --> 00:14:09,313
Look it up on the phone.

408
00:14:09,813 --> 00:14:12,223
- What is it called?
- What is it called?

409
00:14:12,424 --> 00:14:14,794
- Seung Ho, we don't know.
- What is it called?

410
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,862
(Seung Ho has Team Guys' strategy board.)

411
00:14:17,863 --> 00:14:19,663
- What was it?
- I think it was...

412
00:14:19,664 --> 00:14:21,794
Cheonan or Japanese...

413
00:14:23,534 --> 00:14:25,702
I got a result for a pork belly restaurant.

414
00:14:25,703 --> 00:14:26,703
A pork belly restaurant?

415
00:14:26,704 --> 00:14:27,832
(Gosh, Sang Uk)

416
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:28,903
Where is he going?

417
00:14:28,904 --> 00:14:31,602
(Come and get...)

418
00:14:31,603 --> 00:14:32,702
(the strategy board.)

419
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,644
- He left the strategy board there.
- Why?

420
00:14:34,843 --> 00:14:35,874
Why?

421
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:38,113
Does he know what he's doing? Hold on.

422
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:41,482
- I guess he looked it up.
- I see.

423
00:14:41,483 --> 00:14:42,914
Exhibition of Japanese Government Building Remains.

424
00:14:44,154 --> 00:14:48,024
(Meanwhile, Jae Hyeon takes the lead.)

425
00:14:48,693 --> 00:14:49,822
Why is it so far?

426
00:14:49,823 --> 00:14:52,263
(Did he come to the right place?)

427
00:14:52,264 --> 00:14:53,493
Where is the flag?

428
00:14:53,494 --> 00:14:54,562
(Did he come to the right place?)

429
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:56,063
(Hurry up and come here.)

430
00:14:57,904 --> 00:14:59,034
That's the flag.

431
00:14:59,664 --> 00:15:00,733
That's it.

432
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:05,244
(But Seung Ho is following them.)

433
00:15:06,203 --> 00:15:07,503
Should we hurry up and put them to sleep?

434
00:15:07,504 --> 00:15:08,543
(Two Team Guys members prepare to use the nap card.)

435
00:15:08,544 --> 00:15:09,613
Should we put them to sleep?

436
00:15:09,973 --> 00:15:11,443
(Mr. Curator!)

437
00:15:11,514 --> 00:15:15,054
(Will Team Handsome arrive safely?)

438
00:15:19,124 --> 00:15:20,322
- Hey, Sang Uk.
- Seung Ho,

439
00:15:20,323 --> 00:15:22,654
shall we put them to sleep or go to Nonsan for the center square?

440
00:15:22,794 --> 00:15:25,222
- No, we need to take this square.
- Do we need to do that?

441
00:15:25,223 --> 00:15:27,024
- Yes. We have to do it.
- I'll use the nap card then.

442
00:15:27,363 --> 00:15:29,333
Hold on. I think they found it.

443
00:15:29,794 --> 00:15:32,264
(I'm nearly there!)

444
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:34,164
- You must be cold.
- I'm okay.

445
00:15:35,004 --> 00:15:36,273
(Team Handsome arrives at the first spot.)

446
00:15:36,274 --> 00:15:37,274
He found the spot.

447
00:15:37,973 --> 00:15:40,904
He's the brain of the team.

448
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,312
He's the brain.

449
00:15:42,313 --> 00:15:43,313
Okay.

450
00:15:43,314 --> 00:15:45,482
(Guys, I did it.)

451
00:15:45,483 --> 00:15:46,613
That's incredible.

452
00:15:46,644 --> 00:15:48,254
What? Didn't they put us to sleep?

453
00:15:48,284 --> 00:15:50,313
- No.
- They didn't put us to sleep.

454
00:15:50,654 --> 00:15:52,082
We'll put them to sleep.

455
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:53,723
We'll put them to sleep. They haven't entered yet.

456
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,154
All right. Good night.

457
00:15:57,963 --> 00:15:59,924
- But we got here.
- We got here first.

458
00:16:00,424 --> 00:16:02,193
- Seriously.
- We got here before you used it.

459
00:16:02,593 --> 00:16:03,833
- You must use it before arrival.
- I know.

460
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:06,602
Everyone has to arrive.

461
00:16:06,603 --> 00:16:07,732
- No.
- It's just one.

462
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:09,773
- It's about plucking the flag.
- Producer.

463
00:16:09,774 --> 00:16:10,873
Listen.

464
00:16:10,874 --> 00:16:13,044
- We need to play fairly.
- Do you object?

465
00:16:13,404 --> 00:16:16,243
We didn't use the nap card before Jae Hyeon's arrival.

466
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:17,443
But the rule states...

467
00:16:17,514 --> 00:16:19,942
that all three members have to arrive...

468
00:16:19,943 --> 00:16:21,812
Once a member plucks the flag, it counts as arrival.

469
00:16:21,813 --> 00:16:22,883
In that case,

470
00:16:22,884 --> 00:16:23,952
bye.

471
00:16:23,953 --> 00:16:26,154
(Thank you for your hard work.)

472
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,722
Stay healthy.

473
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:30,793
(He's polite until the end.)

474
00:16:30,794 --> 00:16:32,623
- I'll get going.
- You should hurry up and go.

475
00:16:32,624 --> 00:16:35,462
Gosh, Seung Ho is neat.

476
00:16:35,463 --> 00:16:36,494
(The back of the man who admits defeat neatly)

477
00:16:37,693 --> 00:16:38,732
For goodness' sake.

478
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:40,003
(Disappointed)

479
00:16:40,004 --> 00:16:41,133
Let's go.

480
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:43,702
Okay. Let's go to Nonsan. Let's take the square for Nonsan.

481
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,503
That's right. Let's take the square for Nonsan.

482
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,874
Let's go to Gongju right afterward.

483
00:16:47,004 --> 00:16:48,274
- It's close.
- Yes.

484
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:50,014
Then we can go to Buyeo.

485
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:52,744
We can take this route or that route.

486
00:16:55,384 --> 00:16:57,683
We can't slash their tires, right?

487
00:16:58,284 --> 00:16:59,554
- That's...
- That's cheating.

488
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:01,394
- We can't do that.
- That's cheating.

489
00:17:02,593 --> 00:17:05,063
(Why did Yi Kyung get into Team Handsome's car?)

490
00:17:05,723 --> 00:17:08,034
(Entering)

491
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,004
(Clicking endlessly)

492
00:17:15,103 --> 00:17:17,943
(Whirring)

493
00:17:20,274 --> 00:17:21,914
- Yi Kyung.
- I turned on the air conditioner...

494
00:17:22,014 --> 00:17:23,112
in full power.

495
00:17:23,113 --> 00:17:24,613
(I turned on the air conditioner in full power.)

496
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:27,514
(The air conditioner is running in full power.)

497
00:17:27,883 --> 00:17:29,413
I turned on the air conditioner.

498
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:32,583
- What are you going to do?
- I turned on the air conditioner.

499
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:36,523
(The neat man makes the finishing touch.)

500
00:17:36,524 --> 00:17:37,623
- The windows.
- Yes.

501
00:17:38,224 --> 00:17:40,363
- You know...
- We got our revenge.

502
00:17:40,923 --> 00:17:43,033
- You know, - It's like a refrigerated truck.

503
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:44,464
you get hot...

504
00:17:45,234 --> 00:17:47,204
when you play the game. That's why.

505
00:17:47,903 --> 00:17:50,003
- We'll go to Nonsan warmly.
- You guys are warmhearted.

506
00:17:50,004 --> 00:17:51,642
Of course. We're considerate.

507
00:17:51,643 --> 00:17:53,303
I'm a bit hungry.

508
00:17:53,304 --> 00:17:54,342
(Team Guys set off in a relaxed way with the warm bodies and minds.)

509
00:17:54,343 --> 00:17:56,612
- Let's enjoy ourselves today.
- Seriously.

510
00:17:56,613 --> 00:17:58,813
Let's eat everything and enjoy ourselves today.

511
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:03,984
(Team Handsome's car is left in its freezing state.)

512
00:18:04,058 --> 00:18:07,028
(Team Handsome)

513
00:18:07,959 --> 00:18:12,899
(Cheonon: Exhibition of Japanese Government Building Remains)

514
00:18:13,368 --> 00:18:15,537
- Hello.
- Hello.

515
00:18:15,538 --> 00:18:17,168
(He'll give an explanation on the first Handsome Heritage.)

516
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:18,908
I study history.

517
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:21,108
I also teach history at a university. I'm Kim Jae Won.

518
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:22,838
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

519
00:18:23,778 --> 00:18:26,878
I'll begin by showing you a photo.

520
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:28,719
- I love history.
- Okay.

521
00:18:29,018 --> 00:18:30,248
Do you know this photo?

522
00:18:30,249 --> 00:18:31,449
Yes, I do.

523
00:18:32,288 --> 00:18:33,418
What's this photo?

524
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:34,658
Isn't that the Japanese Government Building?

525
00:18:34,659 --> 00:18:35,958
(It's from the Japanese occupation.)

526
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:37,518
- Yes, it is.
- It stood back in the day.

527
00:18:37,858 --> 00:18:40,929
To celebrate the 50th anniversary of liberation,

528
00:18:41,028 --> 00:18:42,757
- it was demolished.
- That's right.

529
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:45,868
The remains of the demolished building...

530
00:18:46,229 --> 00:18:47,429
are...

531
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:50,297
behind us.

532
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:53,038
(The token of humiliation)

533
00:18:54,169 --> 00:18:57,239
(The symbol of Japanese rule stood before the Gyeongbokgung Palace.)

534
00:18:57,538 --> 00:19:00,507
(Japanese Government Building)

535
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:03,648
In the old age, the king lived in the Gyeongbokgung Palace.

536
00:19:03,649 --> 00:19:05,949
In the middle of the palace,

537
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:09,088
Japan built a government building.

538
00:19:09,618 --> 00:19:11,358
- It was humiliating.
- You know a lot about history.

539
00:19:11,558 --> 00:19:12,828
I have the level five certificate in Korean history.

540
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:14,527
- Level five?
- Yes.

541
00:19:14,528 --> 00:19:16,659
- Level one is the highest.
- Yes.

542
00:19:17,298 --> 00:19:19,929
Sir, level five is hard as well.

543
00:19:20,068 --> 00:19:23,968
- To me, it felt like level one.
- I see.

544
00:19:23,969 --> 00:19:25,938
If you hadn't said anything,

545
00:19:25,939 --> 00:19:27,638
I would've thought that it was quite high.

546
00:19:27,639 --> 00:19:29,507
- Level 6 is the lowest.
- Level 6?

547
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:31,208
- Level 5 is above it.
- Did you pass level 6 beforehand?

548
00:19:31,209 --> 00:19:33,209
I got level five since my score was a bit higher.

549
00:19:33,278 --> 00:19:35,117
Fourth graders get level one.

550
00:19:35,118 --> 00:19:36,577
That's right.

551
00:19:36,578 --> 00:19:38,648
There were elementary schoolers when I took the exam.

552
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:39,719
(Laughing)

553
00:19:40,348 --> 00:19:41,888
I see that it isn't much of a feat in your field.

554
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,587
In my field, I'm the only one.

555
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:44,827
- Level five?
- Yes.

556
00:19:44,828 --> 00:19:46,389
- I see.
- That's right.

557
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:47,888
In my eyes, you deserve five stars.

558
00:19:47,889 --> 00:19:49,527
That's right. Thank you.

559
00:19:49,528 --> 00:19:51,198
Let's go up and talk some more.

560
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:52,798
- Okay.
- That sounds good.

561
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:54,939
I didn't know that such a thing existed.

562
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:57,798
What's this?

563
00:19:57,868 --> 00:19:59,067
(When they go up the stairs, a sight unfolds before them.)

564
00:19:59,068 --> 00:20:01,507
During the Japanese occupation,

565
00:20:01,508 --> 00:20:04,078
it was the steeple of the Japanese Government Building.

566
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:07,248
After liberation, it was used as the capital building.

567
00:20:07,249 --> 00:20:09,649
(Exhibition of Japanese Government Building Remains)

568
00:20:11,029 --> 00:20:15,600
(The steeple of the center of the building)

569
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,639
(The building was demolished to eradicate...)

570
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:22,379
(the traces of the colonial period.)

571
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,079
As you can see...

572
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,279
- You came from there, right?
- Yes.

573
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:27,978
That's the Independence Hall of Korea.

574
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:30,820
It's in the west side of the Independence Hall of Korea.

575
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:33,589
There's a meaning behind the location.

576
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:34,748
What's the meaning?

577
00:20:34,749 --> 00:20:37,390
The sun sets in the west.

578
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:40,689
The traces of the Japanese occupation...

579
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,099
will be buried in history.

580
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,228
Is that why it's down there?

581
00:20:45,229 --> 00:20:47,430
- You're right.
- Tae Hyun, you're a genius.

582
00:20:47,529 --> 00:20:50,468
- The ground was dug for 5m.
- I see.

583
00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:52,439
It's a bit like a grave.

584
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,580
The park was designed in a way to bury the past in history.

585
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:59,778
Do you know what the Japanese Government Building did?

586
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:00,978
- Yes.
- Now,

587
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:02,218
the Korean government is divided...

588
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:05,119
into the legislative, the judicial, and the administrative branches.

589
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,748
- Yes. Three.
- The powers are divided.

590
00:21:07,749 --> 00:21:10,090
Back then, the Japanese government controlled everything.

591
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:13,390
It had absolute power.

592
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:16,399
They could do anything they wanted.

593
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,698
(Joseon was ruled by the governor of Japan...)

594
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:19,099
(for easier exploitation and oppression.)

595
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,499
But there was one thing they didn't have.

596
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,239
What didn't they have?

597
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,409
The citizens' hearts?

598
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:26,739
The citizens' hearts?

599
00:21:27,239 --> 00:21:30,208
- That's a heartrending answer.
- Yes.

600
00:21:30,209 --> 00:21:33,379
But I wasn't talking about a sentimental aspect.

601
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,249
They didn't have the right to draw up a budget.

602
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:38,850
The governor wanted to make the building big...

603
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,920
in order to show his power.

604
00:21:41,989 --> 00:21:45,330
When it was built in 1926, it was advertised...

605
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:47,159
as the biggest building in Asia.

606
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,359
(In 1926, it was advertised as the biggest building in Asia.)

607
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,699
How much money was spent?

608
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,829
About 43,000 dollars.

609
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,468
In today's currency, it's about 60 million dollars.

610
00:21:53,469 --> 00:21:54,929
(About 60 million dollars were invested in the building.)

611
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,038
As a result, they lacked money to construct the building...

612
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:58,938
for Government-General of Joseon.

613
00:21:58,939 --> 00:22:00,910
Did they steal money from Koreans?

614
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,180
They sold buildings in Gyeongbokgung Palace.

615
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,708
They took them down and started selling them.

616
00:22:06,709 --> 00:22:07,778
That's right.

617
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:09,478
They sold buildings of Gyeongbokgung Palace?

618
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:13,449
Back then, there were 6,000 sections.

619
00:22:13,789 --> 00:22:17,419
About 90 percent, over 4,000 sections were sold...

620
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,330
at an auction.

621
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,298
(At the end of the 19th century, about 509 buildings)

622
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:24,228
(Beginning of the 20th century, about 40 buildings remained.)

623
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:26,129
(From "Map of the Northern Palace")

624
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:28,028
After the buildings got sold,

625
00:22:28,029 --> 00:22:30,969
they were mostly used to build bars.

626
00:22:31,299 --> 00:22:33,708
Or they put those building parts...

627
00:22:33,709 --> 00:22:35,909
in their front yards.

628
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:37,478
That's right.

629
00:22:37,479 --> 00:22:40,279
In such a demolished space,

630
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,820
a colonial fair was held in 1915.

631
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:44,650
It was called Joseon Industrial Exhibition.

632
00:22:45,219 --> 00:22:50,188
(It was called Joseon Industrial Exhibition.)

633
00:22:50,189 --> 00:22:51,759
It was to commemorate...

634
00:22:51,989 --> 00:22:55,130
the fifth anniversary of annexing Joseon.

635
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:59,369
They exhibited what they've done for Joseon...

636
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,769
for the last five years...

637
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:03,599
in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace.

638
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,099
(They even sold materials and buildings...)

639
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,468
(of Gyeongbokgung Palace during the event.)

640
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:08,169
Didn't they use them to build a zoo?

641
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:09,278
That was Changgyeonggung Palace.

642
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:10,279
- Changgyeonggung Palace?
- It's right next to it.

643
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:11,279
They used Changgyeonggung Palace...

644
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,309
- to build a zoo.
- They changed the name...

645
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,708
to Changgyeongwon instead.

646
00:23:14,709 --> 00:23:16,920
- It became an amusement park.
- Right.

647
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,080
They also kept animals.

648
00:23:18,081 --> 00:23:19,749
Are you saying everything that you know?

649
00:23:19,989 --> 00:23:22,458
I have little memory of it.

650
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:24,059
Tell us during the quiz instead.

651
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:25,120
Okay.

652
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,129
He's very smart.

653
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:28,829
Of course, he's smart.

654
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,258
This is his job. He knows how to explain...

655
00:23:31,259 --> 00:23:32,799
- Is this your job?
- Yes.

656
00:23:33,269 --> 00:23:35,029
- I didn't know that.
- Goodness.

657
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:37,268
It's like you being a good fighter.

658
00:23:37,269 --> 00:23:39,369
- My gosh.
- He's knowledgeable in history.

659
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:40,410
Oh, my.

660
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,879
(He keeps stating the obvious.)

661
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,309
It's his job to explain.

662
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:45,778
- I'm also a teacher at school.
- Really?

663
00:23:45,779 --> 00:23:48,110
- I told you in the beginning.
- I'm sorry.

664
00:23:48,449 --> 00:23:49,449
Goodness.

665
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:51,680
If he's a teacher, he must be impressive.

666
00:23:52,489 --> 00:23:55,919
The 2nd government during the 6th Republic was launched in 1993.

667
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:59,089
There was a movement to set the historical record straight.

668
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,958
They took a bold step.

669
00:24:00,959 --> 00:24:03,859
Right. To commemorate the 50th year of Korea's Independence Day,

670
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,299
people decided to demolish this place in 1995.

671
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,369
It was broadcasted live.

672
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:09,439
Do you remember?

673
00:24:09,969 --> 00:24:11,468
Standing in front of Gyeongbokgung Palace,

674
00:24:11,469 --> 00:24:13,038
the symbol of humiliation from the Japanese colonial period,

675
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,839
the former Government-General of Joseon building's...

676
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,879
last remaining conference room was...

677
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,278
completely demolished today.

678
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:20,979
It disappeared with 70 years of history.

679
00:24:22,449 --> 00:24:27,120
Many people remember that it was exploded,

680
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:30,189
but the building wasn't exploded.

681
00:24:30,959 --> 00:24:32,590
Actually, it was dismantled.

682
00:24:32,729 --> 00:24:34,329
- It was only a performance...
- A performance?

683
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:35,660
to show that we're demolishing it.

684
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,899
The event of lifting off the steeple took place...

685
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,600
back then.

686
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,639
As I explained earlier,

687
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:46,309
after dismantling the steeple, a 5m hole was dug out...

688
00:24:46,310 --> 00:24:47,938
on the west side...

689
00:24:47,939 --> 00:24:49,610
of the Independence Hall to place the steeple.

690
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,109
It was turned into a park.

691
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,809
(It's also used as a record of our painful history...)

692
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,948
(and a source for history education.)

693
00:24:55,949 --> 00:24:57,849
It's a humiliating reminder,

694
00:24:57,850 --> 00:25:00,819
but they separated the top and placed it in here.

695
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,089
Yes, it's very symbolic.

696
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:04,559
It makes me feel much better.

697
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,688
Yes.

698
00:25:05,689 --> 00:25:07,829
- They had it planned out.
- Right.

699
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:10,629
It was to leave the historical record.

700
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,528
- The record should be kept.
- I agree.

701
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:14,699
(Our precious country that we cultivated)

702
00:25:15,969 --> 00:25:21,870
(It's to remember how beautiful and precious it is.)

703
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,949
(Team Guys)

704
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,509
An hour to Nonsan? Okay.

705
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,089
I'd like to feel dominant,

706
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,350
but it's been so long.

707
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:34,890
(Chuckling)

708
00:25:35,289 --> 00:25:36,319
I never felt dominant.

709
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,390
(Feeling bitter)

710
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,590
The reattempt card is the best.

711
00:25:40,259 --> 00:25:41,890
I definitely agree with you.

712
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,999
Yi Kyung, we still have...

713
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:45,529
offensive cards.

714
00:25:45,729 --> 00:25:47,129
- We have GPS identification card...
- Right.

715
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:48,269
and a nap card.

716
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,538
The best is...

717
00:25:49,539 --> 00:25:50,539
(He's still hopeful.)

718
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,070
Other than Tae Hyun,

719
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,870
neither of them will be able to answer the question.

720
00:25:55,439 --> 00:25:56,439
(You're right.)

721
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,479
Dong Hyun has a lot of energy,

722
00:25:59,249 --> 00:26:00,310
but when I watch him...

723
00:26:00,749 --> 00:26:02,149
As his opponent,

724
00:26:02,150 --> 00:26:03,879
I don't know why I feel relieved...

725
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,519
whenever Dong Hyun is energetic.

726
00:26:05,789 --> 00:26:07,248
(Bad-mouthing Team Handsome)

727
00:26:07,249 --> 00:26:08,590
Also, Jae Hyeon...

728
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,959
He knows much less than you think.

729
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:13,089
Is he bad at quizzes?

730
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,228
On top of that, Jae Hyeon has no energy or spirit.

731
00:26:15,229 --> 00:26:17,399
He even lacks energy?

732
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,329
Jae Hyeon is an amazing guy,

733
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,299
but with quizzes in this cold weather...

734
00:26:23,699 --> 00:26:25,539
Between two high-spirited men.

735
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,708
It won't be easy for Jae Hyeon.

736
00:26:27,709 --> 00:26:29,039
(With Dong Hyun and Tae Hyun, Team Guys reached its positivity limit.)

737
00:26:29,239 --> 00:26:30,679
As long as we get to Nonsan,

738
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,180
it won't take long to go to other cities.

739
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:34,080
Buyeo is right next to it.

740
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,149
Gongju is right next to it, too.

741
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:37,319
- It's right next to it.
- Yes.

742
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:38,448
There's no need to worry.

743
00:26:38,449 --> 00:26:40,849
We'll go to Gongju and Buyeo.

744
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,060
(Planning to conquer the south of South Chungcheong)

745
00:26:42,259 --> 00:26:44,420
As long as we get the right answers,

746
00:26:45,289 --> 00:26:46,630
we could complete the bingo after three tries.

747
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:50,259
(At that moment!)

748
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,199
(Crazy Gamer is deep in thought.)

749
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:56,570
(The path Team Guys must take)

750
00:26:57,070 --> 00:27:00,209
(He will draw it with this hand.)

751
00:27:00,969 --> 00:27:03,209
(Crazy Gamer is done thinking.)

752
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:07,110
(Drawing the path without hesitation)

753
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,719
(Erase this.)

754
00:27:09,479 --> 00:27:13,120
(Crazy Gamer's strategy towards victory)

755
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,119
(He finishes his analysis.)

756
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,560
I drew the path.

757
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:22,258
We're heading to Nonsan to block...

758
00:27:22,259 --> 00:27:23,728
the opponents once.

759
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,870
Even if we win Nonsan,

760
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:28,900
we have to go around to complete the bingo.

761
00:27:29,269 --> 00:27:30,269
(Thinking)

762
00:27:30,270 --> 00:27:31,340
And so...

763
00:27:31,739 --> 00:27:33,610
Speaking of which, we don't need to go to Nonsan.

764
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,038
We can stop by Gongju. We haven't passed it yet.

765
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:37,179
Yes, it's on our way.

766
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,340
Let's go to Gonju instead.

767
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:41,449
Seung Ho, you're like Zhuge Liang.

768
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,620
He's just like Zhuge Liang.

769
00:27:45,449 --> 00:27:47,049
It's much closer. I like it.

770
00:27:47,189 --> 00:27:48,860
- That's your favorite phrase.
- Good.

771
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:52,160
(Getting onto another freeway)

772
00:27:53,229 --> 00:27:55,560
This is much wiser.

773
00:27:55,699 --> 00:27:57,798
It only takes 20 minutes from here to Nonsan.

774
00:27:57,799 --> 00:27:59,930
- Yes, it's close.
- We can stop by afterwards.

775
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:03,239
We have to walk for 20 minutes in Gongju.

776
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:04,570
It's so cold.

777
00:28:04,739 --> 00:28:06,208
(He's an indoor athlete.)

778
00:28:06,209 --> 00:28:08,139
It includes a hint card.

779
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,309
- That's good.
- They're giving us a hint card...

780
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:10,379
for suffering.

781
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,979
We must get the hint card no matter what.

782
00:28:12,949 --> 00:28:14,478
- You know what?
- We should let ourselves go.

783
00:28:14,479 --> 00:28:16,620
Let's keep up with our positive energy today.

784
00:28:16,850 --> 00:28:19,390
Getting the right answer is important,

785
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:21,149
but I want to eat something good.

786
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,189
- Right.
- Me too.

787
00:28:22,390 --> 00:28:23,659
What if it's kalguksu in Gongju?

788
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,959
- Gongju kalguksu.
- Gongju kalguksu?

789
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,830
- That would be insane.
- I know.

790
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,899
Thinking about it makes me happy.

791
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,429
(The thought of Gongju kalguksu makes him smile.)

792
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:31,759
Thinking about it made me smile.

793
00:28:32,430 --> 00:28:35,199
We'll get a hint card in Gongju.

794
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,439
This is great.

795
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,100
(Team Handsome)

796
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,609
This is incredible.

797
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:40,968
(Time for Quiz)

798
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,339
It'd be perfect if it's something...

799
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,539
- that Dong Hyun knows.
- I agree.

800
00:28:44,979 --> 00:28:46,350
I feel nervous.

801
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:48,110
Here's your question.

802
00:28:48,449 --> 00:28:49,879
Kim Gu was involved in the independence movement...

803
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,288
away from the Japanese Empire.

804
00:28:52,289 --> 00:28:53,319
Kim Gu?

805
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,119
He couldn't see his family,

806
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,258
so he kept in touch by sending letters.

807
00:28:57,259 --> 00:28:58,259
Okay.

808
00:28:58,459 --> 00:29:00,660
Kim Gu's son, Kim Shin was young at the time.

809
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:03,429
This was the first thing he did...

810
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,728
whenever he received a letter from his father.

811
00:29:05,729 --> 00:29:07,830
- Okay.
- What was this act?

812
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,870
First of all... Wait.

813
00:29:11,969 --> 00:29:13,209
He received the letter.

814
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,639
Maybe he kissed it and didn't read it right away.

815
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,679
I don't think it's kissing.

816
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:21,009
Back then, towards your parents...

817
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:24,248
Historically, it was a Confucian society.

818
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:26,749
Something like a bow?

819
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:28,589
I think bowing is correct.

820
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,789
- That sounds correct.
- Bowing?

821
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:33,458
It's number one answer anyone could come up with.

822
00:29:33,459 --> 00:29:35,028
- What else?
- We need number two.

823
00:29:35,029 --> 00:29:37,359
We have to brainstorm and narrow down the ideas.

824
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,769
Was this during the independence movement?

825
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:40,999
Yes.

826
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,369
- At that time...
- What is it?

827
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,268
How about pledging allegiance?

828
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:48,738
Yes, something like that.

829
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:50,978
Maybe he pledged allegiance to the Korean flag.

830
00:29:50,979 --> 00:29:53,708
His respect to his father equals his respect to the country.

831
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,208
That's possible.

832
00:29:55,209 --> 00:29:57,850
Back then,

833
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,988
filial duty was very important.

834
00:30:00,989 --> 00:30:04,160
Bowing to the letter sounds the most plausible to me.

835
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,728
Or maybe he prayed as soon as he got the letter.

836
00:30:07,729 --> 00:30:09,060
Maybe he was...

837
00:30:09,259 --> 00:30:11,630
Considering that this is a quiz,

838
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:14,269
praying isn't much of an act.

839
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:16,170
(Sighing)

840
00:30:16,171 --> 00:30:18,498
I'm going to take a step back.

841
00:30:18,499 --> 00:30:19,938
- He was involved...
- I'm taking a step back.

842
00:30:19,939 --> 00:30:21,539
in the independence movement.

843
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,278
- The independence movement...
- Let's keep it general...

844
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:24,539
and say "greeting."

845
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:27,110
"Greeting?"

846
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:28,948
We'll go with greeting.

847
00:30:28,949 --> 00:30:30,948
Greeting can be pledging allegiance...

848
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:33,519
or praying.

849
00:30:33,789 --> 00:30:35,319
- All of them are greeting.
- Right.

850
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,988
If we're back to square one,

851
00:30:36,989 --> 00:30:38,560
bowing sounds correct.

852
00:30:38,759 --> 00:30:40,689
- We're back to bowing, right?
- Yes.

853
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,028
Let's give it a try.

854
00:30:43,029 --> 00:30:45,100
- It's the obvious answer.
- I agree.

855
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,929
I don't think there's anything else.

856
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:48,600
- He bowed.
- Bowed?

857
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,170
- He bowed.
- Yes.

858
00:30:50,539 --> 00:30:52,199
If we get it right without hints, it'd be amazing.

859
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:53,670
He bowed to it.

860
00:30:53,939 --> 00:30:55,169
- He bowed to it?
- Yes.

861
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:58,208
(Answer: He bowed.)

862
00:30:58,209 --> 00:30:59,249
That's not correct.

863
00:31:00,249 --> 00:31:02,109
(Embarrassed)

864
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,150
I don't feel tormented.

865
00:31:05,219 --> 00:31:07,820
It'd have been amazing to get it without using the card.

866
00:31:07,989 --> 00:31:09,789
- One?
- This is very...

867
00:31:10,189 --> 00:31:11,518
Tae Hyun, how did you get...

868
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,830
all the right answers with the other team?

869
00:31:13,189 --> 00:31:14,630
I was just as lost on the other team.

870
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,228
You're bad only when I'm on your team.

871
00:31:17,229 --> 00:31:18,258
We got wrong answers too.

872
00:31:18,259 --> 00:31:19,329
Give us a hint.

873
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,399
- Yes.
- Okay.

874
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,570
- The hint is...
- We got many wrong.

875
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,539
the sense of smell.

876
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:25,839
- What?
- Did he smell it?

877
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,268
I was going to say it.

878
00:31:27,269 --> 00:31:29,410
- What?
- It's about the sense of smell.

879
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,309
- I was going to say it.
- Say what?

880
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,349
The smell.

881
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:34,079
Either he smelled the letter to smell his father.

882
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,419
- For his father's body odor?
- Or he kissed the letter.

883
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,619
I was going to say it.

884
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:39,449
The first thing you said was bowing.

885
00:31:40,489 --> 00:31:42,559
To smell his father's body odor,

886
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,420
- did he smell the letter?
- He sniffed it.

887
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,488
The letter was from him.

888
00:31:46,489 --> 00:31:48,229
I feel like I saw it somewhere.

889
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,028
What are you talking about?

890
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:52,129
You're no different from me.

891
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,229
It seems like...

892
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,140
So that he could smell his father,

893
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:57,998
he smelled the letter.

894
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,140
That's correct.

895
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,968
(Is it the correct answer this time?)

896
00:32:01,969 --> 00:32:04,208
(Answer: He smelled the letter.)

897
00:32:04,209 --> 00:32:06,449
- That is correct.
- Goodness.

898
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:10,048
We must answer in such detail to get the correct answer.

899
00:32:10,049 --> 00:32:11,119
(What a bummer.)

900
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,089
Kim Gu's son Kim Shin,

901
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:15,889
in the hopes of smelling his father whom he missed,

902
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,389
took his nose to the stamp that his father must've stuck on...

903
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,860
by applying his saliva on the back.

904
00:32:21,229 --> 00:32:23,859
Later on, Kim Shin became the first chief director...

905
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,359
of the Independence Hall of Korea.

906
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,369
(The late Kim Shin was the first chief director of this place.)

907
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:27,469
- This place? No way.
- Goodness.

908
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:29,039
I had no idea.

909
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,969
The questions he's giving us are not that simple.

910
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,768
(Cheonan: Exhibition of Japanese Government Building Remains)

911
00:32:34,769 --> 00:32:36,279
Since you answered it correctly...

912
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:37,909
Thank you.

913
00:32:37,910 --> 00:32:40,310
You got it right, so check out the meal on the back.

914
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:41,849
Sundae gukbap.

915
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:42,919
(Their reactions are clearly different.)

916
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,479
- Right.
- What a hearty meal.

917
00:32:44,549 --> 00:32:46,120
Aren't you interested in food?

918
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:48,289
- I like to eat after filming.
- What do you think?

919
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:50,959
Really? You eat after the filming is over?

920
00:32:51,189 --> 00:32:52,389
- Yes.
- Really?

921
00:32:52,390 --> 00:32:53,489
Don't you eat at all?

922
00:32:53,529 --> 00:32:54,529
- Do you eat small amounts?
- To be honest,

923
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,899
you can't tell when filming will be over. That's who I am.

924
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,060
What do you mean? What are you like?

925
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,130
I eat after filming has been wrapped up.

926
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:02,298
You don't eat even if you get hungry?

927
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:03,998
I only eat after filming is done.

928
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:05,099
- Do you choose to starve?
- Hey.

929
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,839
You'll be following our lead today.

930
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,768
Hold on a second. You too.

931
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:09,909
- You're like that too!
- Hey.

932
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,708
I don't eat unless I'm hungry.

933
00:33:11,709 --> 00:33:12,849
I avoid that situation.

934
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:13,909
- Seriously?
- Yes.

935
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:16,149
- We have to eat something though.
- Time out.

936
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,819
We have to eat. That's on Tae Hyun.

937
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,620
- How so?
- We have to eat,

938
00:33:19,689 --> 00:33:21,489
so sit at the restaurant for 30 minutes.

939
00:33:22,049 --> 00:33:23,059
- Let's go.
- Did you have breakfast?

940
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,389
Just so you know,

941
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,389
my knees are doing the walking rather than my feet.

942
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:28,390
- Exactly.
- My knees are like this.

943
00:33:28,789 --> 00:33:31,028
- It's freezing.
- My knees are going like this.

944
00:33:31,029 --> 00:33:32,600
- No way.
- Let's get in the car already.

945
00:33:33,129 --> 00:33:35,529
- It's freezing.
- Tae Hyun, where will you sit?

946
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:37,040
I'll ride in the back.

947
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,639
- It's freezing.
- Ride shotgun since you're tall.

948
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,640
(They go to the car to get out of the cold.)

949
00:33:39,641 --> 00:33:40,839
It's freezing.

950
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,279
Gosh, the car.

951
00:33:44,509 --> 00:33:45,910
It's the same temperature in here.

952
00:33:48,449 --> 00:33:50,418
- They opened all the windows.
- Why did they open them?

953
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:51,948
What did they do to the car?

954
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:54,249
(Thanks to Team Guys, the windows were left wide open.)

955
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,289
- No way. It's the same in here.
- It's freezing today.

956
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:58,290
How can it be the same temperature in here?

957
00:34:00,529 --> 00:34:01,889
The windows won't go up.

958
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:04,298
(To make matters worse, the windows won't go up.)

959
00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:05,759
I can't close my window.

960
00:34:06,069 --> 00:34:07,369
(Beaming)

961
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:08,430
It's so cold.

962
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,000
- I'm glad the seats heat up.
- How do I make this warm?

963
00:34:15,569 --> 00:34:16,839
Why does it read "Low?"

964
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:18,879
The AC is on.

965
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,949
(Yi Kyung of Team Guys got his revenge.)

966
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:27,120
(Either way, they head to the restaurant.)

967
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,190
(Team Guys)

968
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,319
This is amazing.

969
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,588
We're almost there. We're eight minutes out.

970
00:34:31,589 --> 00:34:33,029
(They change course and target Gongju first!)

971
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:36,399
(Team Guys enters Gongju which is their first location.)

972
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,259
The entire city must be a historic site.

973
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:40,430
They only have hanok-style houses.

974
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:43,669
(Every city they see while on the road)

975
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:47,410
(The breath of Baekje can be felt.)

976
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,608
Gongju is the hometown...

977
00:34:49,609 --> 00:34:52,310
for our very own Park Chan Ho and Pak Se Ri.

978
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:53,980
This is nice.

979
00:34:54,310 --> 00:34:57,680
Where should we go to see the Tomb of King Muryeong of Baekje?

980
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,418
Today, you'll be seeing the national treasure...

981
00:34:59,419 --> 00:35:01,048
that is the Stone Guardian from the Tomb of King Muryeong.

982
00:35:01,049 --> 00:35:02,119
- A stone guardian?
- Now...

983
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,189
- A stone guardian?
- But we'll make a brief stop.

984
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,029
There, you can obtain a hint card.

985
00:35:07,129 --> 00:35:08,528
- There?
- That takes 20 minutes on foot.

986
00:35:08,529 --> 00:35:10,729
- That's right. Please follow me.
- Sure.

987
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:11,829
- Shall we?
- Got it.

988
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,229
(They can earn a hint card.)

989
00:35:13,230 --> 00:35:15,198
It feels warmer than earlier...

990
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,439
now that the sun is out.

991
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,968
Exactly. Thank goodness for the sun.

992
00:35:17,969 --> 00:35:19,068
It'll be refreshing for the other team...

993
00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:20,140
since we left all the windows open.

994
00:35:20,609 --> 00:35:22,169
Just thinking about it makes me cold.

995
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:24,609
They could actually love it.

996
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:26,810
They're of old age.

997
00:35:27,609 --> 00:35:29,879
Why do I find you hilarious?

998
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,448
As you know, they're on the older side.

999
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:34,689
Director, we're the YB team today.

1000
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:36,960
I'll be 38 by the time this episode airs.

1001
00:35:39,589 --> 00:35:40,929
I'm now in my thirties too.

1002
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:42,229
(Groaning of the youngest member)

1003
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:43,359
It's upsetting.

1004
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:44,929
Being 30 is actually fine.

1005
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:46,569
- It's like 29 being extended.
- Really?

1006
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,600
We... Hold on.

1007
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,039
Up there?

1008
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,399
(What appears before them as they converse)

1009
00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:52,940
It's huge.

1010
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:56,180
Compared to tombs we're accustomed to,

1011
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,810
- Of course.
- the size of this...

1012
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:00,548
(My gosh)

1013
00:36:00,549 --> 00:36:01,810
How can it be this big?

1014
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:03,519
The size of a king's tomb...

1015
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,120
is nothing like what we'd expect.

1016
00:36:05,419 --> 00:36:07,120
Check out the size of this.

1017
00:36:08,350 --> 00:36:11,519
This is the Tomb of King Muryeong and Royal Tombs...

1018
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,460
- in Gongju.
- Royal Tombs?

1019
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:15,029
- Yes.
- Royal Tombs?

1020
00:36:15,259 --> 00:36:17,629
There are many tombs of kings from the Baekje period.

1021
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:19,269
The stone guardian you'll see today...

1022
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:21,829
was excavated from the Royal Tombs.

1023
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,439
(List of national treasures excavated from this site)

1024
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,298
(Stone Guardian from the Tomb of King Muryeong...)

1025
00:36:25,299 --> 00:36:27,168
(and 11 other treasures)

1026
00:36:27,169 --> 00:36:29,109
Was it open to the public before?

1027
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,548
(In the past, we were allowed to go inside.)

1028
00:36:33,549 --> 00:36:34,809
It's been a while since it was closed off.

1029
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:36,249
Since 1997.

1030
00:36:36,250 --> 00:36:38,679
(In 1997, the tomb was permanently closed to preserve cultural assets.)

1031
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,690
- Eventually.
- Right after Sang Uk was born.

1032
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,589
It was before my first birthday.

1033
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:47,890
The Tomb of King Muryeong and Royal Tombs Exhibit Hall.

1034
00:36:49,029 --> 00:36:51,798
Check this out. It's like we're entering the tomb.

1035
00:36:51,799 --> 00:36:52,899
(They enter feeling like they're entering the ancient tomb.)

1036
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,369
- Goodness.
- What's this?

1037
00:36:56,370 --> 00:36:57,869
(The inner part of the Tomb of King Muryeong...)

1038
00:36:57,870 --> 00:36:59,370
(that was recreated)

1039
00:37:00,109 --> 00:37:01,140
What's this?

1040
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,710
(My gosh)

1041
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,109
(The tomb is like a tunnel made of bricks that were stacked.)

1042
00:37:07,549 --> 00:37:12,549
(Bricks with delicate patterns display an extravagant interior.)

1043
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:17,660
(Seeing the aesthetic sense of people from 1,500 years ago)

1044
00:37:17,819 --> 00:37:19,560
There's a bun that looks like this.

1045
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:22,459
- It has this shape.
- A crepe.

1046
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,460
That's right.

1047
00:37:23,461 --> 00:37:25,259
Why did they choose this pattern?

1048
00:37:25,799 --> 00:37:27,430
Sang Uk, I know what this is.

1049
00:37:28,029 --> 00:37:29,370
Do you know wafers filled with jam?

1050
00:37:30,169 --> 00:37:31,999
- Some have glutinous rice cake.
- Of course I know that.

1051
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,508
- There's an ice cream version.
- Right.

1052
00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:35,568
We link everything to things we can eat.

1053
00:37:35,569 --> 00:37:37,279
More so than I expected...

1054
00:37:39,449 --> 00:37:40,810
It's right here.

1055
00:37:42,379 --> 00:37:43,619
- It's here.
- I see.

1056
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:44,648
(What's this?)

1057
00:37:44,649 --> 00:37:45,649
What's that?

1058
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,120
Is it a passport photo?

1059
00:37:49,121 --> 00:37:50,960
(The 36th stratagem)

1060
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:54,089
(Is that our hint?)

1061
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:57,129
That's your hint, so keep it safe on you.

1062
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,298
(It doesn't make a lot of sense,)

1063
00:38:00,299 --> 00:38:02,128
(but they head out now that they have their hint.)

1064
00:38:02,129 --> 00:38:03,769
(Checking before leaving)

1065
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:05,299
This place is fascinating.

1066
00:38:05,669 --> 00:38:07,410
Why haven't we heard the cuckoo cry?

1067
00:38:08,239 --> 00:38:09,269
You're right.

1068
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:11,479
- It's about time we heard it.
- Yes, it's about time.

1069
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,608
(We should get the news right about now.)

1070
00:38:12,609 --> 00:38:13,878
But we...

1071
00:38:13,879 --> 00:38:17,449
(Cuckoo)

1072
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,589
- Cheonan.
- Okay, good.

1073
00:38:20,219 --> 00:38:21,719
I bet they used one of the chance cards.

1074
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:23,359
The timing suggests that.

1075
00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:25,520
We only have to be here and in Nonsan.

1076
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,189
We already looked around this place...

1077
00:38:27,190 --> 00:38:28,628
- for 20 minutes.
- Exactly.

1078
00:38:28,629 --> 00:38:30,429
But they only just got it right.

1079
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:32,528
That means they at least used one or maybe two.

1080
00:38:32,529 --> 00:38:33,969
- One...
- They at least used one.

1081
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,069
But here,

1082
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,169
we were told it'd be 20 minutes,

1083
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,639
but it's taking us about 30 instead.

1084
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,810
(It's taking them over 20 minutes.)

1085
00:38:41,609 --> 00:38:43,309
We're being too sweet and taking our time.

1086
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,008
(They must walk across a hill to reach the museum.)

1087
00:38:45,009 --> 00:38:46,680
This place really is huge.

1088
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,048
This is what crossed my mind sometimes.

1089
00:38:49,049 --> 00:38:51,148
You never know. There could be treasures beneath us...

1090
00:38:51,149 --> 00:38:52,818
that haven't been excavated yet.

1091
00:38:52,819 --> 00:38:53,850
Sure.

1092
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:55,719
That's the case in Gyeongju.

1093
00:38:56,489 --> 00:39:00,589
Right. From what I hear, people make discoveries...

1094
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:02,330
while plowing their fields.

1095
00:39:02,390 --> 00:39:03,930
They hear a sudden metal sound.

1096
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:09,029
Goodness. This is Gongju National Museum.

1097
00:39:09,370 --> 00:39:11,299
- GNM in short.
- How fascinating.

1098
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,309
Hello, ma'am.

1099
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,608
- Hello.
- Hello.

1100
00:39:14,609 --> 00:39:16,309
You must be our guide at this museum.

1101
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,778
That's right. Welcome.

1102
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:19,479
Hello, I'm Na Seon Min, the curator and arts researcher...

1103
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,949
here at Gongju National Museum.

1104
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,449
- Curator and arts researcher.
- Right.

1105
00:39:22,509 --> 00:39:25,119
Allow me to first tell you about the Tomb of King Muryeong.

1106
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,389
The Tomb of King Muryeong...

1107
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:30,418
was only investigated 53 years ago...

1108
00:39:30,419 --> 00:39:32,659
- in 1971.
- I see.

1109
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,460
- So not that long ago.
- That's right.

1110
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:37,499
The Tomb of King Muryeong...

1111
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,798
was discovered during the monsoon season in 1971...

1112
00:39:39,799 --> 00:39:41,528
when the drains...

1113
00:39:41,529 --> 00:39:43,669
were being worked on due to heavy rain.

1114
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:48,108
(July, 1971, on a rainy day, an ancient tomb was discovered.)

1115
00:39:48,109 --> 00:39:49,508
(The mystery of Baekje:)

1116
00:39:49,509 --> 00:39:50,910
(The discovery of the Tomb of King Muryeong)

1117
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,849
(The tomb of King Muryeong who was the 25th king of Baekje...)

1118
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,609
(has been discovered.)

1119
00:39:55,149 --> 00:39:56,979
(It was discovered by chance during the maintenance work...)

1120
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,819
(of the drains beneath Baekje's 6th ancient tomb.)

1121
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:03,419
(It was discovered fully intact without traces of it being robbed.)

1122
00:40:04,919 --> 00:40:07,459
(It was one of the most shocking discoveries...)

1123
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,960
(in the history of Korean archaeology.)

1124
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:13,028
The Tomb of King Muryeong was located between...

1125
00:40:13,029 --> 00:40:14,968
the 5th and 6th ancient tombs.

1126
00:40:14,969 --> 00:40:17,639
Inside the tomb that was randomly discovered,

1127
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,939
buried memorial tablets were discovered...

1128
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:21,508
which told us who the tomb belonged to.

1129
00:40:21,509 --> 00:40:23,508
By studying those memorial tablets,

1130
00:40:23,509 --> 00:40:26,108
we found out that the tomb belonged to King Muryeong...

1131
00:40:26,109 --> 00:40:27,608
who was the 25th king of Baekje.

1132
00:40:27,609 --> 00:40:29,080
(King Muryeong of Baekje passed away at the age of 62.)

1133
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,219
(The only Baekje tomb whose owner was identified)

1134
00:40:34,989 --> 00:40:39,390
(Glorious relics poured out of that ancient tomb.)

1135
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,329
(Handsome Heritage 3:)

1136
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:44,100
(The heritage that was awoken after 1,500 years)

1137
00:40:44,129 --> 00:40:45,559
Is this real?

1138
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:48,869
Yes, it's the actual treasure that was excavated...

1139
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:50,069
- from the tomb.
- There it is.

1140
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,168
- You can call it...
- Is this the front?

1141
00:40:52,169 --> 00:40:53,668
the mascot of our museum.

1142
00:40:53,669 --> 00:40:55,039
They made it well even back then.

1143
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,539
Exactly. It's the artifact called Animal Tomb Guardian...

1144
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,749
which is an imaginary animal guarding the tomb.

1145
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:00,979
(National treasure: Animal Tomb Guardian...)

1146
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,210
(of the Tomb of King Muryeong from the 6th century)

1147
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:06,419
(At the entrance of the grave)

1148
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:11,358
(It guarded the king and queen for about 1,500 years.)

1149
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,330
It's the only animal tomb guardian that has been discovered in Korea.

1150
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,128
Which animal is it?

1151
00:41:16,129 --> 00:41:18,499
- It looks like a pig, - I think it's a pig.

1152
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,999
but it also has a horn and wings...

1153
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,229
which makes it...

1154
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,468
- an imaginary animal.
- Which animal is it?

1155
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:24,068
The horn must be made of bronze,

1156
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:25,269
but what was the body...

1157
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:26,439
- made out of? Stone?
- Yes, stone.

1158
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:29,068
The horn is of iron while the body is of stone.

1159
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:31,639
In China, animal tomb guardians...

1160
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,809
are only made out of one material.

1161
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:35,148
However, that from the Tomb of King Muryeong...

1162
00:41:35,149 --> 00:41:37,749
had a horn made of iron and a body made out of stone.

1163
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,519
The fact that different materials were used on this...

1164
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,290
- is what makes it different.
- The horn...

1165
00:41:42,149 --> 00:41:44,988
(What artifact will Team Guys see next?)

1166
00:41:44,989 --> 00:41:46,120
No way. What's this?

1167
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:50,600
(A sizable artifact catches their attention.)

1168
00:41:53,270 --> 00:41:55,298
These are wooden coffins.

1169
00:41:55,299 --> 00:41:56,299
(The wooden coffins of King Muryeong and his queen)

1170
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:58,168
- Are they real?
- They're real.

1171
00:41:58,169 --> 00:42:00,440
- Yes, they're real. Yes.
- From a thousand years ago?

1172
00:42:00,569 --> 00:42:03,539
Among the excavated coffins of the Three Kingdoms Period,

1173
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:06,238
- these coffins are the most intact.
- Were they processed...

1174
00:42:06,239 --> 00:42:08,878
after they were excavated?

1175
00:42:08,879 --> 00:42:11,378
They underwent preservation treatments...

1176
00:42:11,379 --> 00:42:13,849
to look like they do now.

1177
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,259
(They were restored to look like they did in the past.)

1178
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:23,128
(But the wood was quite intact at the time of the excavation.)

1179
00:42:23,129 --> 00:42:25,628
- Even though they were wood, - Yes.

1180
00:42:25,629 --> 00:42:27,128
- they remained intact.
- Yes.

1181
00:42:27,129 --> 00:42:29,639
They didn't rot much...

1182
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,398
because layers of lacquer was applied to the surface.

1183
00:42:32,399 --> 00:42:37,779
Lacquer prevented moisture and corrosion.

1184
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:40,648
Inside the king and queen's coffins,

1185
00:42:40,649 --> 00:42:43,520
various jewelry pieces were found.

1186
00:42:43,779 --> 00:42:45,778
You're looking...

1187
00:42:45,779 --> 00:42:47,649
at the earrings of the king.

1188
00:42:48,219 --> 00:42:52,959
(King Muryeong's gold earrings from the 6th century)

1189
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:55,659
We ran an analysis on the purity of the earrings.

1190
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:59,199
The link contains 99.8 percent of gold.

1191
00:42:59,299 --> 00:43:01,468
It's very close to pure gold.

1192
00:43:01,469 --> 00:43:04,040
- It's pure gold.
- Yes. We could check that.

1193
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,339
- Baekje has the best quality.
- That's right.

1194
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:12,009
(You need multiple hours to check out all the artifacts.)

1195
00:43:12,839 --> 00:43:15,278
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1196
00:43:15,279 --> 00:43:17,179
(Time for Quiz)

1197
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,379
Now comes the quiz.

1198
00:43:19,719 --> 00:43:21,619
The Stone Guardian from the Tomb of King Muryeong...

1199
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,918
is a mythological animal that guards the tomb from the intruders...

1200
00:43:24,919 --> 00:43:26,390
and evil energy.

1201
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,229
At the time of the excavation,

1202
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:32,099
its right hind leg was broken.

1203
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,128
The right ear?

1204
00:43:33,129 --> 00:43:35,169
- The hind leg.
- The hind leg.

1205
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,338
According to a theory,

1206
00:43:37,339 --> 00:43:40,509
its leg was broken on purpose before it got added to the tomb.

1207
00:43:40,870 --> 00:43:42,468
What's the reason behind it?

1208
00:43:42,469 --> 00:43:44,679
(What's the reason behind it?)

1209
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:46,009
I think I know the answer.

1210
00:43:46,449 --> 00:43:47,679
I think I know the answer.

1211
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,209
(How did he figure it out...)

1212
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:51,250
(so soon?)

1213
00:43:52,279 --> 00:43:53,789
It's a mythological animal...

1214
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:55,719
that needs to protect the king.

1215
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:57,789
- To keep it from running away?
- To keep it from running away.

1216
00:43:57,790 --> 00:43:58,890
It needed to stay in the tomb.

1217
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,489
I think that's right.

1218
00:44:00,989 --> 00:44:03,698
- Earlier, - Its leg was broken on purpose.

1219
00:44:03,699 --> 00:44:05,259
we received a hint.

1220
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,528
(What's the hint they received earlier?)

1221
00:44:07,529 --> 00:44:09,128
Yi Kyung, it has to be correct.

1222
00:44:09,129 --> 00:44:10,839
(Sang Uk is certain as well.)

1223
00:44:11,199 --> 00:44:12,238
(The hint is "36 Stratagems.")

1224
00:44:12,239 --> 00:44:14,069
The hint was "36 Stratagems."

1225
00:44:14,509 --> 00:44:15,838
- This was the hint.
- To prevent feeling...

1226
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,239
Young people are more familiar with 60 Chicken these days.

1227
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:21,379
(That's a totally different thing.)

1228
00:44:21,449 --> 00:44:22,879
What's the best strategy in "36 Stratagems?"

1229
00:44:22,949 --> 00:44:24,378
- Fleeing.
- That's right. Fleeing.

1230
00:44:24,379 --> 00:44:25,480
Fleeing.

1231
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:27,349
(What's feeling in "36 Stratagems?")

1232
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:29,489
(It's one of the strategies in a Chinese essay of war.)

1233
00:44:29,589 --> 00:44:31,289
Its leg was broken before it got added to the tomb.

1234
00:44:31,290 --> 00:44:32,589
That's right. It was done on purpose.

1235
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,689
- So...
- It was done on purpose.

1236
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,359
shall we give the answer without wasting more time?

1237
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:36,628
Shall we do that?

1238
00:44:36,629 --> 00:44:37,759
Let me answer.

1239
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,269
So that the animal tomb guardian...

1240
00:44:40,270 --> 00:44:42,468
could do its duty...

1241
00:44:42,469 --> 00:44:45,600
of protecting the tomb without feeling, its leg was broken.

1242
00:44:46,169 --> 00:44:48,168
It was done to keep it from fleeing.

1243
00:44:48,169 --> 00:44:50,910
(It was done to make it protect the tomb without fleeing.)

1244
00:44:51,279 --> 00:44:53,449
(Is the answer correct?)

1245
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,710
Correct.

1246
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:56,580
- It was...
- We answered well.

1247
00:44:56,850 --> 00:44:57,918
It was...

1248
00:44:57,919 --> 00:44:59,349
- Let's go.
- Very easy.

1249
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:01,289
(It was very easy.)

1250
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:02,619
The excavators...

1251
00:45:02,620 --> 00:45:06,190
initially thought that its leg was broken due to carelessness.

1252
00:45:06,489 --> 00:45:08,628
But animal tomb guardians that were found in China...

1253
00:45:08,629 --> 00:45:10,959
also had a broken hind leg.

1254
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:12,559
All right. Give us the card.

1255
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,898
- What will we eat?
- Let it be Gongju's kalguksu.

1256
00:45:14,899 --> 00:45:16,699
- Take it.
- Thank you.

1257
00:45:17,069 --> 00:45:19,669
Gosh, this isn't what we wanted.

1258
00:45:20,069 --> 00:45:21,968
(Nervous)

1259
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:23,009
(Stone Guardian from the Tomb of King Muryeong)

1260
00:45:23,509 --> 00:45:25,579
(Gongju: Chestnut bread)

1261
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,279
To be honest, I'm a bit upset about this.

1262
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,549
We can eat it on the road.

1263
00:45:29,919 --> 00:45:32,519
- We can eat it on the road. Yes.
- Then we'll get ahead.

1264
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:34,119
I wanted to eat meat.

1265
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:36,319
(I wanted to eat meat and kalguksu.)

1266
00:45:36,719 --> 00:45:38,560
We got the square for Gongju.

1267
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:41,258
We'll decide on the next location.

1268
00:45:41,259 --> 00:45:42,989
We told ourselves that we wouldn't get stressed out today.

1269
00:45:43,129 --> 00:45:44,858
We'll have the chestnut bread...

1270
00:45:44,859 --> 00:45:46,600
- to go.
- I'm so relaxed right now.

1271
00:45:46,629 --> 00:45:48,469
We'll go to Nonsan right away.

1272
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:49,898
- Nonsan?
- Yes.

1273
00:45:49,899 --> 00:45:51,738
- Okay. Please hit the road.
- Okay.

1274
00:45:51,739 --> 00:45:53,608
- It's a secret.
- A secret.

1275
00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:54,870
I'll keep it a secret.

1276
00:45:56,469 --> 00:45:58,539
- Gongju.
- Gongju.

1277
00:45:58,540 --> 00:46:02,982
(Gongju: Stone Guardian from the Tomb of King Muryeong)

1278
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:04,349
- Is this the place?
- We're here.

1279
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:06,379
- Thank you.
- Thank you for your hard work.

1280
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:07,789
I'll order.

1281
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:08,949
Gosh, there are pork ribs on the stone griddle.

1282
00:46:09,589 --> 00:46:11,689
No. Sundae gukbap was the only item on the card.

1283
00:46:11,690 --> 00:46:13,660
- Just order sundae gukbap.
- Tae Hyun.

1284
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,089
The name of the restaurant...

1285
00:46:15,589 --> 00:46:18,799
contains ribs on the stone griddle and sundae gukbap.

1286
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:20,469
Seriously.

1287
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,770
How about sundae hot pot?

1288
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:23,540
Forget it.

1289
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,169
I was just asking.

1290
00:46:25,399 --> 00:46:27,709
We won't be able to finish the dish.

1291
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:30,140
Pork ribs on the stone griddle or sundae?

1292
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:33,479
We're already eating sundae gukbap, so I'll order pork ribs.

1293
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:36,179
(He orders food through careful calculations.)

1294
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:38,278
- Just one?
- One.

1295
00:46:38,279 --> 00:46:39,479
Tae Hyun, it's 14 dollars.

1296
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:41,449
- It must be one serving.
- One.

1297
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:43,758
- Order one.
- Okay.

1298
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,790
It'll take too long.

1299
00:46:44,859 --> 00:46:46,959
I bet they went to Gongju.

1300
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,528
I would've gone to Gongju.

1301
00:46:48,529 --> 00:46:50,258
My eyes were on Gongju too.

1302
00:46:50,259 --> 00:46:52,929
- So I bet they went to Gongju.
- They have a hint card,

1303
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:54,270
so they must've gone to Gongju.

1304
00:46:54,399 --> 00:46:56,769
Tae Hyun, they'll go to Gongju, Nonsan, and Buyeo.

1305
00:46:56,770 --> 00:46:58,870
- A diagonal line?
- Yes. It'll be very easy.

1306
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,009
That's the only option.

1307
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:04,040
I see why Tae Hyun is so good at the race.

1308
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:05,710
As he plays the game,

1309
00:47:05,779 --> 00:47:07,750
he keeps coming up with plans.

1310
00:47:08,149 --> 00:47:09,779
- He has strategies.
- Really?

1311
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:13,589
It'll be neat if we get an alarm during the meal.

1312
00:47:14,049 --> 00:47:15,120
Eat slowly.

1313
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:17,718
What? Then...

1314
00:47:17,719 --> 00:47:20,429
- Don't order more food. Hey.
- Tae Hyun.

1315
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:22,460
You just need to eat slowly.

1316
00:47:22,529 --> 00:47:24,559
Let's order hot pot instead of sundae gukbap.

1317
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:25,560
We can't do that.

1318
00:47:25,561 --> 00:47:27,169
It'll take too long. We can't do that.

1319
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:29,128
- It'll be spicy and tasty.
- No.

1320
00:47:29,129 --> 00:47:30,399
- It's perfect for the weather.
- No.

1321
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:33,069
Our food is here. It's here.

1322
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:34,270
It was prepared very quickly.

1323
00:47:35,509 --> 00:47:39,609
(A hot bowl of gukbap will warm their bodies.)

1324
00:47:41,850 --> 00:47:44,379
(Would you like a warm spoonful?)

1325
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:45,878
- Enjoy the food.
- Enjoy the food.

1326
00:47:45,879 --> 00:47:46,989
All right.

1327
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,319
(Blowing)

1328
00:47:53,589 --> 00:47:55,730
(It's hot.)

1329
00:47:55,890 --> 00:47:56,960
It's good.

1330
00:47:57,359 --> 00:47:58,959
It's so nice to eat this in the morning.

1331
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,329
(A warm spoonful chases away the coldness in the body.)

1332
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:01,429
There's a lot of meat.

1333
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:03,540
(A warm spoonful chases away the coldness in the body.)

1334
00:48:11,580 --> 00:48:13,238
(Laughing...)

1335
00:48:13,239 --> 00:48:14,579
(and crying)

1336
00:48:14,580 --> 00:48:15,749
It's so tasty.

1337
00:48:15,750 --> 00:48:17,149
(Laughing and crying)

1338
00:48:18,219 --> 00:48:21,620
(He's expressive when he eats.)

1339
00:48:23,049 --> 00:48:24,088
It's so tasty.

1340
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:26,060
(How about Jae Hyeon, the man with a small appetite?)

1341
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:29,029
Exactly.

1342
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:36,270
(Even he can't put down the spoon because it's so tasty.)

1343
00:48:38,799 --> 00:48:40,639
It tastes like beef gukbap. It's tasty.

1344
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,169
Yes, it's tasty.

1345
00:48:42,509 --> 00:48:43,779
You picked the right dishes.

1346
00:48:44,879 --> 00:48:46,310
All of them are incredibly tasty.

1347
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:48,349
They're so tasty that you can't say no.

1348
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:49,549
They're famous.

1349
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:51,948
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1350
00:48:51,949 --> 00:48:53,278
(Another one of such a dish appears.)

1351
00:48:53,279 --> 00:48:55,850
- It looks tasty.
- How is it only 14 dollars?

1352
00:48:56,390 --> 00:48:57,488
Thank you.

1353
00:48:57,489 --> 00:48:58,959
I'm glad we didn't order two.

1354
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:00,128
(The pork ribs on the stone griddle looks hearty.)

1355
00:49:00,129 --> 00:49:01,290
This is incredible.

1356
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,930
Is this one serving?

1357
00:49:03,230 --> 00:49:04,898
Are you that happy when there's a lot of food?

1358
00:49:04,899 --> 00:49:06,898
(Of course.)

1359
00:49:06,899 --> 00:49:08,069
I hate it when there isn't enough food.

1360
00:49:08,469 --> 00:49:09,899
I hate it when there isn't enough food during a meal.

1361
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,739
I'd rather have leftovers.

1362
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:13,068
(Laughing)

1363
00:49:13,069 --> 00:49:14,210
I'm serious.

1364
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:16,068
There's so much meat.

1365
00:49:16,069 --> 00:49:17,940
(Jae Hyeon cuts the meat.)

1366
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,379
(He eats it right away.)

1367
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:31,119
(Thus, the eating show begins once again.)

1368
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,419
It has a smoky flavor.

1369
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:35,029
- It's so tasty.
- It's tasty.

1370
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:36,128
Protein.

1371
00:49:36,129 --> 00:49:37,359
(Impressed)

1372
00:49:42,569 --> 00:49:44,569
It's the characteristic athletes share.

1373
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:46,599
They keep going, "Protein."

1374
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,239
(They keep talking about protein as they eat.)

1375
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:50,108
Protein.

1376
00:49:50,109 --> 00:49:51,210
High in protein.

1377
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,879
(He's eating with gusto.)

1378
00:49:55,049 --> 00:49:56,778
- It's very tasty.
- This place serves tasty food.

1379
00:49:56,779 --> 00:49:58,719
(Satisfied)

1380
00:49:59,279 --> 00:50:00,619
(They're disappointed that they used a reattempt card.)

1381
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,049
I racked my brain.

1382
00:50:02,620 --> 00:50:05,319
We have two reattempt cards,

1383
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:08,529
so we can't help but become relaxed...

1384
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:10,629
like the hare in "The Tortoise and the Hare."

1385
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:12,529
- That's right.
- We do things half-heartedly.

1386
00:50:12,629 --> 00:50:13,999
How did you answer the questions in the past?

1387
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,698
(How did you answer the questions in the past?)

1388
00:50:15,699 --> 00:50:17,399
He looked very smart when he was on the other team.

1389
00:50:17,469 --> 00:50:19,540
But he's the same as me when he's on my team.

1390
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,270
You're better.

1391
00:50:21,469 --> 00:50:23,370
- I don't understand.
- I don't know much.

1392
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:27,379
We'll use the remaining card in the next quiz.

1393
00:50:27,879 --> 00:50:31,149
When you have a reattempt card, you end up using it right away.

1394
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,619
(The alarm doesn't go off even when their meal ends.)

1395
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:35,790
The alarm isn't going off.

1396
00:50:36,419 --> 00:50:38,120
Tae Hyun, perhaps they got it right.

1397
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:41,060
Let's head over to Gongju. If we receive the alarm...

1398
00:50:41,290 --> 00:50:43,858
for Gongju on our way. we can go to Nonsan.

1399
00:50:43,859 --> 00:50:46,028
- What if we don't receive it?
- Then we can go to Gongju.

1400
00:50:46,029 --> 00:50:47,528
Let's go and see if their car is there.

1401
00:50:47,529 --> 00:50:48,569
- Yes.
- Okay.

1402
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,939
I'll be nice to have a cup of coffee now.

1403
00:50:50,940 --> 00:50:52,068
(I'll be nice to have a cup of coffee now.)

1404
00:50:52,069 --> 00:50:53,739
Gongju bread...

1405
00:50:54,069 --> 00:50:55,839
and chestnut latte.

1406
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:58,479
Is chestnut famous in Gongju?

1407
00:50:58,480 --> 00:50:59,839
- I'm craving it.
- Yes.

1408
00:51:00,009 --> 00:51:01,149
(Right?)

1409
00:51:01,609 --> 00:51:02,909
- Shall we go?
- Let's go.

1410
00:51:02,910 --> 00:51:04,680
- We need to go.
- We don't have much time. Let's go.

1411
00:51:05,719 --> 00:51:06,989
Dong Hyun, it's nice.

1412
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:08,419
I'm full.

1413
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:10,460
How about coffee?

1414
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:12,258
- Maybe later.
- Maybe later.

1415
00:51:12,259 --> 00:51:13,559
That means we won't get to drink coffee.

1416
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,830
We can drink it in Gongju.

1417
00:51:15,259 --> 00:51:16,729
(Cuckoo)

1418
00:51:16,730 --> 00:51:18,359
- It's the alarm. Good.
- Gongju.

1419
00:51:18,529 --> 00:51:19,960
- Gongju.
- Gongju.

1420
00:51:20,029 --> 00:51:21,198
- Was it Gongju?
- Yes.

1421
00:51:21,199 --> 00:51:22,429
- Let's go to Nonsan.
- Okay.

1422
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:23,568
- We need to get there fast.
- Perfect timing.

1423
00:51:23,569 --> 00:51:25,468
Shall we drink coffee before we go?

1424
00:51:25,469 --> 00:51:26,668
No. We need to go.

1425
00:51:26,669 --> 00:51:27,968
- We need to go.
- Coffee.

1426
00:51:27,969 --> 00:51:29,508
- Hurry up and drive.
- It'll only take three minutes.

1427
00:51:29,509 --> 00:51:30,608
- Hurry up and drive.
- Really?

1428
00:51:30,609 --> 00:51:32,940
- Let's hurry up and go.
- Okay.

1429
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:36,779
(They set out to Nonsan without any dessert in the end.)

1430
00:51:36,810 --> 00:51:39,580
From here, it'll take an hour.

1431
00:51:39,719 --> 00:51:42,149
If they have a meal hurriedly and put us to sleep...

1432
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:45,859
Even if they put us to sleep, we'll be faster in terms of time.

1433
00:51:46,390 --> 00:51:48,730
We'll be set unless you do something ridiculous.

1434
00:51:49,629 --> 00:51:51,358
- Like making a wrong turn?
- That's right.

1435
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,429
Shall we make a quick stop at a rest area?

1436
00:51:52,430 --> 00:51:54,029
I'll kill you if you do that.

1437
00:51:54,969 --> 00:51:56,499
(Team Handsome speeds up...)

1438
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:58,398
(with Tae Hyun watching.)

1439
00:51:58,399 --> 00:51:59,838
Wait a minute. It should be around here.

1440
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,809
- Gongju...
- Gongju, there it is.

1441
00:52:01,810 --> 00:52:03,469
This is a market too.

1442
00:52:03,779 --> 00:52:04,879
This is really...

1443
00:52:05,210 --> 00:52:07,948
Here it is. The main store of chestnut bread.

1444
00:52:07,949 --> 00:52:09,409
I'll order it to-go.

1445
00:52:09,410 --> 00:52:11,379
Yes, with coffee. Shall I go with you?

1446
00:52:11,549 --> 00:52:13,648
- Hello.
- Hello.

1447
00:52:13,649 --> 00:52:14,649
Hello.

1448
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:17,460
We can buy various pastries.

1449
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:20,120
The chestnut bread... It's here.

1450
00:52:20,359 --> 00:52:21,689
Shall we get an iced Americano for each?

1451
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:23,229
- Absolutely.
- I'd love to, absolutely.

1452
00:52:23,230 --> 00:52:24,560
Excuse me.

1453
00:52:25,529 --> 00:52:26,629
- Yes.
- Here she is.

1454
00:52:26,899 --> 00:52:28,600
Don't you need to take an order in there?

1455
00:52:29,129 --> 00:52:30,129
Yes.

1456
00:52:30,699 --> 00:52:31,739
"Yes."

1457
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,469
I like this.

1458
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:34,968
Well...

1459
00:52:34,969 --> 00:52:37,338
- It works this way too.
- Really?

1460
00:52:37,339 --> 00:52:40,479
First, we'll have three cups of iced Americano.

1461
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:41,480
Yes.

1462
00:52:41,481 --> 00:52:43,378
- Chestnut bread...
- Okay.

1463
00:52:43,379 --> 00:52:45,020
Let's get the sweet potato one too.

1464
00:52:45,449 --> 00:52:47,088
- This one looks tasty to me.
- By any chance,

1465
00:52:47,089 --> 00:52:48,589
is your birthday near?

1466
00:52:49,020 --> 00:52:50,020
Why?

1467
00:52:50,021 --> 00:52:51,758
We're providing an event.

1468
00:52:51,759 --> 00:52:53,459
- We...
- It's next month.

1469
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:54,729
- Next month.
- Is it next month?

1470
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:56,089
- January?
- Yes, January.

1471
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:58,960
I guess you don't know anyone whose birthday is next week.

1472
00:52:59,759 --> 00:53:01,000
No, this week.

1473
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:03,270
How about I say that mine is this week?

1474
00:53:04,169 --> 00:53:05,468
You have a gift of gab.

1475
00:53:05,469 --> 00:53:07,710
- What's going on?
- It's just we are...

1476
00:53:07,969 --> 00:53:09,409
Sang Uk says this is on him.

1477
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:11,309
- I forgot. Sorry.
- Sang Uk is...

1478
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:12,980
Sang Uk was born in Daejeon.

1479
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:15,449
- One pizza too.
- That's right.

1480
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,779
- It's 27.6 dollars.
- That's nice.

1481
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,219
- That's nice.
- Put it into this.

1482
00:53:20,690 --> 00:53:22,318
I can put it in here, right?

1483
00:53:22,319 --> 00:53:24,258
She's so nice. She's responding to everything we do.

1484
00:53:24,259 --> 00:53:25,859
You have a sense of humor.

1485
00:53:26,819 --> 00:53:28,930
(Seung Ho looks at the bread.)

1486
00:53:30,259 --> 00:53:31,430
I'll go get a cake!

1487
00:53:34,230 --> 00:53:35,499
(I'll go get a cake!)

1488
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:38,369
(Moving forward to look for a cake!)

1489
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:39,770
He's like a top gun.

1490
00:53:40,040 --> 00:53:42,910
When I see Seung Ho charging, it scares me.

1491
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,109
(He looks like he'd get all the cakes in the hood.)

1492
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:50,679
Here's a bakery.

1493
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,819
(After spotting a bakery, he charges forward.)

1494
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:55,318
(Searching a bakery nearby)

1495
00:53:55,319 --> 00:53:56,350
Hello.

1496
00:53:56,589 --> 00:53:58,719
- Do you have cakes?
- We don't have cakes.

1497
00:53:58,859 --> 00:54:00,690
(Losing his spirits)

1498
00:54:01,259 --> 00:54:02,259
Thank you.

1499
00:54:02,629 --> 00:54:06,160
(Charging to the next place to search)

1500
00:54:07,330 --> 00:54:10,770
(I'll find it, no matter what.)

1501
00:54:11,699 --> 00:54:14,339
I mean, we can get one on our way back.

1502
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,809
Hello, Seung Ho.

1503
00:54:16,810 --> 00:54:17,979
Did you leave the bakery?

1504
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:19,209
Yes, we did.

1505
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:20,479
Wait a minute.

1506
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,548
- Where are you?
- Do I need to cross the street?

1507
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:22,549
Seung Ho.

1508
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:24,180
Where on earth are you now?

1509
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:27,548
When you go straight from the bakery to the direction of number five...

1510
00:54:27,549 --> 00:54:29,549
and turn right, you'll see the main street.

1511
00:54:29,620 --> 00:54:31,818
- Wait there. We're going.
- Okay.

1512
00:54:31,819 --> 00:54:33,620
(He hasn't found a cake, and he doesn't know where he is.)

1513
00:54:34,290 --> 00:54:36,529
Why did you go there? Goodness.

1514
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:38,329
I heard it was near,

1515
00:54:38,330 --> 00:54:39,330
but it wasn't. I failed.

1516
00:54:39,331 --> 00:54:40,629
I'm going back. Don't worry.

1517
00:54:41,029 --> 00:54:42,668
We're stuck in downtown now.

1518
00:54:42,669 --> 00:54:43,739
(The road is jammed up.)

1519
00:54:45,239 --> 00:54:46,298
Where has he gone?

1520
00:54:46,299 --> 00:54:47,339
(The clock is ticking.)

1521
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:49,238
(Due to Seung Ho's unexpected action,)

1522
00:54:49,239 --> 00:54:50,879
(Team Guys is losing time in Gongju.)

1523
00:54:51,410 --> 00:54:53,640
(Team Handsome)

1524
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:56,608
(Heading to Nonsan without doing something riciculous)

1525
00:54:56,609 --> 00:54:57,980
It's close.

1526
00:54:58,419 --> 00:54:59,479
Isn't it?

1527
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:01,349
The last factor we can think of is...

1528
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:04,160
that they don't eat a meal, but a dessert.

1529
00:55:04,819 --> 00:55:06,488
If that happens...

1530
00:55:06,489 --> 00:55:08,329
To have a meal fast,

1531
00:55:08,330 --> 00:55:10,029
they can order a to-go meal and have it in the car.

1532
00:55:10,230 --> 00:55:11,799
Without that, we're fine.

1533
00:55:13,259 --> 00:55:14,999
(Would they be able to catch up with Team Guys,)

1534
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,729
(who is being held back because of chestnut bread?)

1535
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:17,869
Is it a left turn?

1536
00:55:17,870 --> 00:55:19,698
Why on earth are you doing this?

1537
00:55:19,699 --> 00:55:22,540
It will be nice if you could get in the car now.

1538
00:55:22,739 --> 00:55:24,779
- Where is he?
- How far did you go?

1539
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:29,509
I'm right in front of a blue truck. Okay.

1540
00:55:30,350 --> 00:55:31,519
I'm right in front...

1541
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,218
- of a blue truck.
- I see you.

1542
00:55:33,219 --> 00:55:35,089
Okay. Thank you.

1543
00:55:35,649 --> 00:55:36,949
He's furious.

1544
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:39,489
Why are you doing this?

1545
00:55:39,859 --> 00:55:40,989
- You know...
- Seung Ho.

1546
00:55:41,060 --> 00:55:42,489
I came here...

1547
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:44,500
hearing it's right in front.

1548
00:55:45,029 --> 00:55:46,129
But it wasn't.

1549
00:55:46,759 --> 00:55:47,799
Thanks.

1550
00:55:48,299 --> 00:55:49,469
The most unique one.

1551
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,539
I can feel the chestnut's taste.

1552
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:53,910
- It's inside, right?
- Yes.

1553
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:58,379
I don't usually eat bread a lot, but this tastes amazing.

1554
00:55:58,609 --> 00:56:00,710
I don't enjoy eating bread, to be honest.

1555
00:56:01,310 --> 00:56:02,479
I don't eat bread either.

1556
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,149
(Eating in one bite)

1557
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,049
(What's this taste?)

1558
00:56:08,419 --> 00:56:09,989
The cheese ball tastes so good.

1559
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,190
(Seung Ho who went through a lot takes a bit too.)

1560
00:56:13,589 --> 00:56:15,060
You need to listen to this sound.

1561
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,859
This is it.

1562
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,759
- The sound is unbelievable.
- Is it?

1563
00:56:21,469 --> 00:56:22,469
(Chewy)

1564
00:56:24,669 --> 00:56:27,339
(The cheese ball opened Sang Uk's eyes to bread.)

1565
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:28,640
Shall I eat just one more?

1566
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:34,108
(Taking every kind of bread he has in one bite)

1567
00:56:34,109 --> 00:56:36,109
It was like that back then.

1568
00:56:36,310 --> 00:56:37,378
It tastes seriously good.

1569
00:56:37,379 --> 00:56:38,480
(I love bread.)

1570
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:40,619
I like something like this.

1571
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:44,219
I'm on a drive with friends, and it feels like I'm traveling.

1572
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:47,020
A war of nerves and an eyeing game.

1573
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,129
I want to do this without those today.

1574
00:56:49,730 --> 00:56:51,729
They might be in Nonsan with a very low possibility,

1575
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:53,230
then we can go elsewhere.

1576
00:56:54,399 --> 00:56:56,668
Today, I'll consider this as going on a drive.

1577
00:56:56,669 --> 00:56:58,569
Today, the concept of our team is "No Stress."

1578
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,669
- "No Stress." - "No Stress."

1579
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:02,509
Yi Kyung, by the way,

1580
00:57:02,609 --> 00:57:05,410
it almost feels like an open car in the back seat now.

1581
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:07,749
Why? You mean because of the sunlight?

1582
00:57:07,750 --> 00:57:08,809
(The sun is shining only on Seung Ho.)

1583
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:11,120
I'm now slightly stressed out because of the solar heat.

1584
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:13,850
(Getting stressed in 10 seconds after stating "No Stress")

1585
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:16,918
(The car is running to Nonsan in a warm sunlight.)

1586
00:57:16,919 --> 00:57:18,818
(Team Handsome)

1587
00:57:18,819 --> 00:57:21,929
They must be heading to Nonsan now...

1588
00:57:21,930 --> 00:57:23,160
if they had a meal, right?

1589
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:24,730
They're going to Nonsan 100 percent, I guess.

1590
00:57:24,830 --> 00:57:27,230
The moment we arrive, they'd use the nap card.

1591
00:57:27,669 --> 00:57:29,399
- I think that's possible.
- Yes.

1592
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,069
We're here.

1593
00:57:35,009 --> 00:57:36,009
Here we are.

1594
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:38,480
(They arrive at Nonsan, anyway.)

1595
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:40,810
The navigation says we should go straight.

1596
00:57:41,410 --> 00:57:43,649
The parking lot is here.

1597
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:45,218
(Surprised)

1598
00:57:45,219 --> 00:57:46,318
Is their car here?

1599
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:47,548
- It's here.
- They're here.

1600
00:57:47,549 --> 00:57:48,890
(Did they find Team Guys' car?)

1601
00:57:50,219 --> 00:57:51,759
Did they arrive here before us?

1602
00:57:51,989 --> 00:57:53,489
How come they came so fast?

1603
00:57:53,719 --> 00:57:55,029
How can they come here so fast?

1604
00:57:56,129 --> 00:57:59,629
Team YB is here to conquer Nonsan too.

1605
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:01,899
We're in the parking lot, and the other team's car isn't here.

1606
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:04,539
(They park the car first.)

1607
00:58:04,540 --> 00:58:05,540
Here too.

1608
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:06,799
Jeungjang-cheonwang.

1609
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,810
Yi Kyung wasn't on our team back then.

1610
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,838
- Damun-cheonwang.
- Did it appear in the show...

1611
00:58:10,839 --> 00:58:12,310
- for the first filming?
- Yes.

1612
00:58:12,609 --> 00:58:14,378
Then I guess they didn't have a meal.

1613
00:58:14,379 --> 00:58:15,980
- Was it a snack?
- I know.

1614
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:17,649
I can't believe this.

1615
00:58:18,750 --> 00:58:19,818
(What he feared came true.)

1616
00:58:19,819 --> 00:58:21,719
Let's go to Buyeo A right away.

1617
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:23,488
Under the condition they get the answer in Nonsan,

1618
00:58:23,489 --> 00:58:25,390
we need to go to Buyeo A right away.

1619
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,019
- Let's go.
- Let's go to Buyeo.

1620
00:58:27,020 --> 00:58:28,290
- I'm heading to Buyeo A.
- Okay.

1621
00:58:28,730 --> 00:58:30,830
By the way, how did they come here so fast?

1622
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:33,399
I'm really upset.

1623
00:58:33,759 --> 00:58:35,769
- It's all right, Tae Hyun.
- I mean,

1624
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:37,870
- They must have come right away.
- how can this happen?

1625
00:58:38,370 --> 00:58:40,609
- Today, it's...
- What on earth has happened?

1626
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:42,508
(Team Guys, 10 minutes ago)

1627
00:58:42,509 --> 00:58:43,540
Here's...

1628
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,239
The tree here looks like a protected tree.

1629
00:58:47,910 --> 00:58:50,148
Earlier, Seung Ho imitated Dong Hyun.

1630
00:58:50,149 --> 00:58:51,350
Do you want to see it?

1631
00:58:51,779 --> 00:58:52,980
- I got it.
- It's exactly the same.

1632
00:58:53,620 --> 00:58:56,089
(Great!)

1633
00:58:56,549 --> 00:58:58,960
(Verifying the original with Dong Hyun)

1634
00:58:59,489 --> 00:59:01,359
(After getting the answer for the quiz dramatically,)

1635
00:59:01,589 --> 00:59:04,759
(he expresses the joy with his whole body.)

1636
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:07,028
That's the same!

1637
00:59:07,029 --> 00:59:08,229
(Great Work, Seung Ho.)

1638
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:09,600
When you said, "I got it."

1639
00:59:10,699 --> 00:59:12,238
We haven't climbed high,

1640
00:59:12,239 --> 00:59:13,739
but the view from here already looks different.

1641
00:59:16,270 --> 00:59:20,649
(Stone Standing Maitreya Bodhisattva of Gwanchoksa Temple)

1642
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:24,020
I do feel breathless, though.

1643
00:59:24,149 --> 00:59:25,219
Gwanchoksa Temple.

1644
00:59:31,719 --> 00:59:33,189
(Handsome Heritage 3)

1645
00:59:33,190 --> 00:59:35,758
(A gigantic statue of Buddha as tall as a 6th-floor apartment)

1646
00:59:35,759 --> 00:59:37,660
(They're going to see it now.)

1647
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:39,730
Gwanchoksa Temple.

1648
00:59:40,299 --> 00:59:41,398
Hello.

1649
00:59:41,399 --> 00:59:43,569
- Hello.
- It's nice to meet you.

1650
00:59:43,629 --> 00:59:46,298
I'm a culture and tourism guide of Nonsan,

1651
00:59:46,299 --> 00:59:47,608
Lee Sook Sil.

1652
00:59:47,609 --> 00:59:49,369
- Thank you in advance.
- Thank you in advance.

1653
00:59:49,370 --> 00:59:51,008
- You're from Nonsan.
- Yes.

1654
00:59:51,009 --> 00:59:54,209
You're here at Gwanchoksa Temple in Mount Banya.

1655
00:59:54,210 --> 00:59:55,509
Shall we go this way? Okay.

1656
00:59:56,609 --> 00:59:58,979
(Team Guys moves slowly following her lead.)

1657
00:59:58,980 --> 01:00:01,649
From 10am to 12pm,

1658
01:00:01,949 --> 01:00:04,190
it's a period for praying.

1659
01:00:06,790 --> 01:00:08,189
(Gwanchoksa Temple is filled with Buddhist scriptures chants.)

1660
01:00:08,190 --> 01:00:09,329
- Is it this way?
- Yes.

1661
01:00:09,330 --> 01:00:10,898
(They look around the temple.)

1662
01:00:10,899 --> 01:00:11,899
By any chance...

1663
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,369
(Exclaiming)

1664
01:00:14,370 --> 01:00:15,599
Gosh, I had no idea!

1665
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:17,330
(What caught Team Guys' attention immediately?)

1666
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:20,399
(As they pass by Mireukjeon Hall,)

1667
01:00:20,839 --> 01:00:24,140
(a stone standing Buddha shows its presence.)

1668
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,948
(Stone Standing Maitreya Bodhisattva of Gwanchoksa Temple)

1669
01:00:27,949 --> 01:00:29,749
(National treasure, 10th century)

1670
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:31,849
We didn't see it earlier from where we were.

1671
01:00:31,850 --> 01:00:32,850
I see.

1672
01:00:33,319 --> 01:00:34,350
It's amazing.

1673
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:35,648
How come that's so big?

1674
01:00:35,649 --> 01:00:37,250
- It's huge.
- How did they make it in the past?

1675
01:00:39,290 --> 01:00:40,318
I can't believe that.

1676
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,488
(It's taller than a 6th-floor apartment building.)

1677
01:00:41,489 --> 01:00:42,889
(A big Buddha statue, 18.12m high)

1678
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:45,659
It's a Buddha statue as tall as 18.12m.

1679
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:46,660
Gosh.

1680
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,899
(Welcoming Team Guys showing its grandness)

1681
01:00:50,469 --> 01:00:52,169
Could you tell us about it?

1682
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:54,238
The Buddha statue here...

1683
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:57,608
began to be constructed in 968, King Gwangjong's reign in Goryeo.

1684
01:00:57,609 --> 01:00:59,508
- In 968.
- And in 1006,

1685
01:00:59,509 --> 01:01:01,048
- In 968.
- it was complete.

1686
01:01:01,049 --> 01:01:03,048
It took 37 years.

1687
01:01:03,049 --> 01:01:05,249
This was made for 37 years.

1688
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:06,250
Right.

1689
01:01:06,419 --> 01:01:08,520
Shall we look at the memorial stone over there?

1690
01:01:09,589 --> 01:01:12,758
The story of Gwanchoksa Temple is recorded there.

1691
01:01:12,759 --> 01:01:14,629
- I see.
- The memorial stone says,

1692
01:01:14,830 --> 01:01:17,859
women were picking herbs in Mount Banya,

1693
01:01:17,930 --> 01:01:19,699
and they heard a child crying.

1694
01:01:21,069 --> 01:01:23,870
So they went there, but they didn't see a crying child,

1695
01:01:24,199 --> 01:01:26,899
and there was a huge stone.

1696
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,239
They thought it was something unusual.

1697
01:01:29,339 --> 01:01:31,339
And through the government office,

1698
01:01:31,609 --> 01:01:34,180
the news went to King Gwangjong.

1699
01:01:34,379 --> 01:01:38,180
King Gwangjong ordered Monk Hyemyeong...

1700
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:40,249
(It's a good sign that a big Buddha statue should be built.)

1701
01:01:40,250 --> 01:01:42,889
(Make sure to construct a Buddha's statue.)

1702
01:01:42,890 --> 01:01:47,020
Over 100 masons were mobilized, and this was made.

1703
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:49,028
(I see.)

1704
01:01:49,029 --> 01:01:50,358
If you look at the Buddha statue,

1705
01:01:50,359 --> 01:01:53,729
- it's divided into three parts.
- Right.

1706
01:01:53,730 --> 01:01:55,899
- Like this?
- One, two, and three?

1707
01:01:55,969 --> 01:01:58,639
- It's not one piece of rock.
- Right.

1708
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,468
It's made of three big parts.

1709
01:02:00,469 --> 01:02:02,710
Monk Hyemyeong built this statue...

1710
01:02:02,770 --> 01:02:04,639
with stonemasons.

1711
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:07,238
They must have built it with a lot of care and effort.

1712
01:02:07,239 --> 01:02:09,648
- It required a lot of labor force.
- Of course.

1713
01:02:09,649 --> 01:02:12,620
Like building a dolmen in the past,

1714
01:02:12,980 --> 01:02:15,850
didn't they make a big pile to reach the top?

1715
01:02:15,949 --> 01:02:17,818
They can't have carried it here.

1716
01:02:17,819 --> 01:02:19,818
That's impossible. Granite is very heavy.

1717
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,159
- That's quite unlikely.
- This is incredible.

1718
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:25,159
Do you see something yellow above the eyes?

1719
01:02:25,160 --> 01:02:26,698
- It's called baekho.
- Is it made with gold?

1720
01:02:26,699 --> 01:02:28,668
- Baekho?
- Baekho.

1721
01:02:28,669 --> 01:02:30,029
(Baekho on the forehead between the eyebrows)

1722
01:02:32,339 --> 01:02:33,738
- It's sparkling.
- Yes.

1723
01:02:33,739 --> 01:02:35,710
(The baekho sparkles when the light shines on it.)

1724
01:02:35,770 --> 01:02:38,639
Here's where the name Gwanchoksa Temple comes from.

1725
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:42,079
Monk Jian from China saw something...

1726
01:02:42,080 --> 01:02:45,250
sparkling while passing by.

1727
01:02:45,449 --> 01:02:48,019
He came all the way here to hold a service.

1728
01:02:48,020 --> 01:02:49,719
(Facing Stone Standing Maitreya Bodhisattva at Mount Banya)

1729
01:02:50,250 --> 01:02:53,218
There's a story that...

1730
01:02:53,219 --> 01:02:55,758
the baekho glowed like a candle.

1731
01:02:55,759 --> 01:02:59,059
(Gwanchoksa Temple)

1732
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:01,128
Thank you for your explanation today.

1733
01:03:01,129 --> 01:03:02,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1734
01:03:02,899 --> 01:03:04,798
Shall we take a closer look?

1735
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:05,839
(Moving quietly)

1736
01:03:07,169 --> 01:03:11,140
(Crazy Gamer charges on as soon as the explanation is over.)

1737
01:03:11,540 --> 01:03:13,409
(Taking big strides)

1738
01:03:13,410 --> 01:03:15,209
Seung Ho, he went to read...

1739
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:16,349
He went to study.

1740
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:17,679
(Switching to studying mode)

1741
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:20,349
At this magical Gwanchoksa Temple,

1742
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:22,049
- we'll take the quiz.
- Okay.

1743
01:03:22,149 --> 01:03:23,948
- No stress.
- No stress.

1744
01:03:23,949 --> 01:03:25,389
- We don't want stress.
- No stress.

1745
01:03:25,390 --> 01:03:26,988
- Let's proceed with ease.
- Okay.

1746
01:03:26,989 --> 01:03:29,858
As she explained, Stone Standing Maitreya Bodhisattva is so big...

1747
01:03:29,859 --> 01:03:33,500
that they had a hard time building it.

1748
01:03:33,930 --> 01:03:36,528
According to a legend, Monk Hyemyeong got a hint...

1749
01:03:36,529 --> 01:03:38,738
from watching children do this...

1750
01:03:38,739 --> 01:03:40,369
in order to finish...

1751
01:03:40,370 --> 01:03:43,009
building this stone statue.

1752
01:03:43,509 --> 01:03:46,509
What were the children doing?

1753
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:49,109
I got an answer,

1754
01:03:49,250 --> 01:03:52,278
but I'd like to discuss with others first.

1755
01:03:52,279 --> 01:03:53,378
I'll be honest with you.

1756
01:03:53,379 --> 01:03:55,588
The name of the play was written...

1757
01:03:55,589 --> 01:03:56,719
on there.

1758
01:03:57,390 --> 01:03:59,060
However, I can't remember.

1759
01:04:00,359 --> 01:04:03,459
Why do you always end up saying that you don't remember?

1760
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:05,529
I think it mentioned some kind of play.

1761
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:08,370
(I read something.)

1762
01:04:08,399 --> 01:04:09,468
First of all...

1763
01:04:09,469 --> 01:04:10,668
(Yi Kyung's guess)

1764
01:04:10,669 --> 01:04:11,898
This is how they built it.

1765
01:04:11,899 --> 01:04:13,140
The rock was placed on the flat ground.

1766
01:04:13,299 --> 01:04:15,209
They pushed it over a pile of earth...

1767
01:04:15,210 --> 01:04:16,310
and dug out the earth.

1768
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:17,939
Like in the past...

1769
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:22,910
(Yi Kyung thought of how dolmens were built.)

1770
01:04:23,779 --> 01:04:24,818
Based on that,

1771
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:26,749
what did the children do?

1772
01:04:26,750 --> 01:04:27,918
(Trying to get the answer based on his guess)

1773
01:04:27,919 --> 01:04:28,988
There's a children's play...

1774
01:04:28,989 --> 01:04:32,520
called Toad House where you take away the earth.

1775
01:04:32,989 --> 01:04:35,159
- Piling sand?
- Maybe he saw something like that.

1776
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:36,390
Piling sand is another example.

1777
01:04:37,089 --> 01:04:38,099
(Thinking hard)

1778
01:04:38,100 --> 01:04:39,959
Can I take a few minutes to think?

1779
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:41,229
Take your time.

1780
01:04:41,230 --> 01:04:42,668
We have no stress.

1781
01:04:42,669 --> 01:04:44,540
They piled up the sand.

1782
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,270
Could it be a play that involves putting something on top?

1783
01:04:52,279 --> 01:04:54,449
That's definitely a possibility.

1784
01:04:54,710 --> 01:04:56,709
Let's say that...

1785
01:04:56,710 --> 01:04:58,148
this answer is wrong.

1786
01:04:58,149 --> 01:05:00,778
Then I'll regret why I didn't take the time...

1787
01:05:00,779 --> 01:05:03,249
to correct the answer.

1788
01:05:03,250 --> 01:05:04,358
- Take your time.
- I'm trying not to regret.

1789
01:05:04,359 --> 01:05:05,619
There's no stress.

1790
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:06,918
No stress? Okay.

1791
01:05:06,919 --> 01:05:08,829
I'm trying not to regret it.

1792
01:05:08,830 --> 01:05:10,329
I will need...

1793
01:05:10,330 --> 01:05:12,599
- about 37 seconds.
- Anyway,

1794
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,370
here's why it's a good guess.

1795
01:05:14,399 --> 01:05:16,000
When they built this,

1796
01:05:16,299 --> 01:05:18,769
they probably piled up the earth,

1797
01:05:18,770 --> 01:05:21,269
pushed over the rock, and dug it out.

1798
01:05:21,270 --> 01:05:22,770
There's no other answer.

1799
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:24,878
Here's the answer.

1800
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:28,750
He got the idea from watching children play with sand.

1801
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:30,750
Children are playing with sand?

1802
01:05:31,819 --> 01:05:35,049
(Please)

1803
01:05:35,350 --> 01:05:37,418
(Answer: From watching children play with sand)

1804
01:05:37,419 --> 01:05:39,358
- That's correct.
- See? I told you.

1805
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:41,088
- Yi Kyung...
- Don't think too much.

1806
01:05:41,089 --> 01:05:42,889
- There's no need to get excited.
- I mean...

1807
01:05:42,890 --> 01:05:44,699
- I explained it to you.
- You can read this.

1808
01:05:45,060 --> 01:05:46,160
Was it written here?

1809
01:05:46,230 --> 01:05:47,968
- It's much longer than that.
- I didn't finish reading it.

1810
01:05:47,969 --> 01:05:49,969
I only remembered 18m.

1811
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:52,738
The answer is "playing with dirt."

1812
01:05:52,739 --> 01:05:55,039
- So that was the play.
- Playing with dirt?

1813
01:05:55,040 --> 01:05:56,939
My answer was exact.

1814
01:05:56,940 --> 01:05:58,139
(From watching two children play with dirt by the river)

1815
01:05:58,140 --> 01:06:01,080
They divided it into three parts and worked from the ground.

1816
01:06:01,410 --> 01:06:04,249
After piling each piece over the pile of sand,

1817
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,318
they removed the sand.

1818
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:09,020
- It was accurate.
- He also called 1,000 strong men.

1819
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,088
- Right?
- About 1,000 strong men.

1820
01:06:11,089 --> 01:06:14,318
He always asks questions that have nothing to do...

1821
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:15,689
with anything I work hard to memorize.

1822
01:06:15,690 --> 01:06:17,859
- Outside the range of questions.
- How many stonemasons?

1823
01:06:18,600 --> 01:06:20,159
Wasn't it about 100?

1824
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,429
- A hundred.
- Right, I read it.

1825
01:06:21,430 --> 01:06:24,798
- This is good teamwork.
- Exactly.

1826
01:06:24,799 --> 01:06:25,939
Let's shout it once.

1827
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:27,199
- No stress.
- No stress.

1828
01:06:28,669 --> 01:06:30,310
- Gwanchoksa Temple.
- Gwanchoksa Temple.

1829
01:06:32,779 --> 01:06:35,909
(Nonsan: Stone Standing Maitreya Bodhisattva of Gwanchoksa Temple)

1830
01:06:35,910 --> 01:06:37,580
What will it be? Seung Ho is hungry.

1831
01:06:38,279 --> 01:06:40,048
(What's the dish in Nonsan?)

1832
01:06:40,049 --> 01:06:41,290
Shall we look at it together? What is it?

1833
01:06:41,902 --> 01:06:43,131
What is it?

1834
01:06:43,156 --> 01:06:43,825
(Curious)

1835
01:06:46,428 --> 01:06:48,066
(What's the dish in Nonsan?)

1836
01:06:48,067 --> 01:06:49,227
Shall we look at it together? What is it?

1837
01:06:50,097 --> 01:06:51,236
What is it?

1838
01:06:51,237 --> 01:06:52,237
(Curious)

1839
01:06:55,237 --> 01:06:57,066
(Laughing)

1840
01:06:57,067 --> 01:06:58,636
- I like it.
- Is this right?

1841
01:06:58,637 --> 01:07:00,707
I'm sorry, but we'll get this to go.

1842
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:01,877
(We'll get this to go.)

1843
01:07:01,878 --> 01:07:03,346
Where would we eat this?

1844
01:07:03,347 --> 01:07:05,717
- We can't go anywhere to eat it.
- Where can we eat it?

1845
01:07:05,718 --> 01:07:07,277
There isn't a strawberry restaurant.

1846
01:07:07,678 --> 01:07:09,917
I'll be honest with you.

1847
01:07:09,918 --> 01:07:11,187
After putting them to sleep,

1848
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,486
it's over once we wish someone a birthday and go to Buyeo.

1849
01:07:13,487 --> 01:07:14,726
(Buyeo A: Gilt-bronze Incense Burner of Baekje)

1850
01:07:14,727 --> 01:07:16,557
- Then it's over.
- We can put them to sleep.

1851
01:07:16,857 --> 01:07:17,958
Okay.

1852
01:07:18,128 --> 01:07:20,226
- That's what we'll do.
- No stress.

1853
01:07:20,227 --> 01:07:22,567
(I might have seen the other team.)

1854
01:07:22,928 --> 01:07:25,137
(Team Handsome)

1855
01:07:25,168 --> 01:07:26,497
You said it first.

1856
01:07:26,498 --> 01:07:27,596
(Cuckoo)

1857
01:07:27,597 --> 01:07:29,708
- Nonsan.
- See? They got it all.

1858
01:07:29,968 --> 01:07:31,276
(Sighing)

1859
01:07:31,277 --> 01:07:33,277
Why are they getting all the questions right?

1860
01:07:33,878 --> 01:07:36,107
I want to know how they're doing it.

1861
01:07:36,578 --> 01:07:39,316
It's what we expected anyway,

1862
01:07:39,317 --> 01:07:40,918
but they're good with quizzes.

1863
01:07:40,947 --> 01:07:43,316
We might still arrive in Buyeo first.

1864
01:07:43,317 --> 01:07:44,886
- They have to eat too.
- Of course.

1865
01:07:44,887 --> 01:07:46,758
We'll block Buyeo.

1866
01:07:47,057 --> 01:07:49,227
Then they'll go to block Seosan.

1867
01:07:49,387 --> 01:07:51,257
We have to eat without letting them know.

1868
01:07:51,258 --> 01:07:52,857
As long as we block Buyeo,

1869
01:07:53,258 --> 01:07:54,927
it won't be so hard for us.

1870
01:07:54,928 --> 01:07:56,067
(Buyeo County)

1871
01:07:56,567 --> 01:07:59,667
While buying a cake...

1872
01:07:59,668 --> 01:08:02,038
Is there a particular cake you want?

1873
01:08:02,368 --> 01:08:03,936
Let's buy a strawberry cake...

1874
01:08:03,937 --> 01:08:05,177
so that we can eat some.

1875
01:08:05,178 --> 01:08:07,877
You're right. If they have a strawberry cake...

1876
01:08:07,878 --> 01:08:10,647
Yes, we'll get a cake with many strawberries.

1877
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:13,446
We'll buy another one to wish someone happy birthday.

1878
01:08:13,447 --> 01:08:15,047
Is your birthday this week?

1879
01:08:15,048 --> 01:08:16,418
- I already had mine.
- Did you?

1880
01:08:17,147 --> 01:08:18,617
- In that case...
- That's not good.

1881
01:08:18,618 --> 01:08:20,217
How will we find someone whose birthday is this week?

1882
01:08:20,218 --> 01:08:21,487
We're in trouble.

1883
01:08:22,057 --> 01:08:23,087
Please sign it.

1884
01:08:23,088 --> 01:08:24,088
(Seung Ho escapes.)

1885
01:08:24,187 --> 01:08:25,458
There he goes again.

1886
01:08:25,498 --> 01:08:26,798
He's acting unexpectedly again.

1887
01:08:27,828 --> 01:08:29,097
You know what?

1888
01:08:29,328 --> 01:08:30,627
He went to find someone whose birthday is this week.

1889
01:08:30,628 --> 01:08:31,998
(On to searching the birthday person)

1890
01:08:32,937 --> 01:08:35,737
(He searches the hair salon without hesitating.)

1891
01:08:36,107 --> 01:08:37,507
Hello, ma'am.

1892
01:08:37,508 --> 01:08:40,277
I'm sorry to interrupt,

1893
01:08:40,737 --> 01:08:42,947
but is anyone's birthday this week?

1894
01:08:45,118 --> 01:08:46,378
No?

1895
01:08:46,647 --> 01:08:49,248
None of them. Stay healthy. Thank you.

1896
01:08:50,588 --> 01:08:54,628
(Compared to his passion, the result is poor.)

1897
01:08:55,158 --> 01:08:56,957
Thank you. We'll stay for ten minutes...

1898
01:08:56,958 --> 01:08:58,127
to eat it.

1899
01:08:58,128 --> 01:09:01,266
(A customer enters.)

1900
01:09:01,267 --> 01:09:03,128
- Which cake is ours?
- I'll take it.

1901
01:09:05,097 --> 01:09:06,498
Is your birthday this week?

1902
01:09:07,937 --> 01:09:10,066
- This week? Yes.
- Wait.

1903
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:11,207
This week? Yes.

1904
01:09:11,208 --> 01:09:13,307
Wait.

1905
01:09:13,508 --> 01:09:14,806
When is your birthday this week?

1906
01:09:14,807 --> 01:09:16,447
December 29.

1907
01:09:16,508 --> 01:09:17,846
Open up a calendar.

1908
01:09:17,847 --> 01:09:19,477
- Why?
- Her birthday is December 29.

1909
01:09:19,578 --> 01:09:20,947
On the 29th?

1910
01:09:21,847 --> 01:09:23,846
- It's this week.
- It's this Sunday.

1911
01:09:23,847 --> 01:09:24,856
- This Sunday?
- Yes.

1912
01:09:24,857 --> 01:09:26,717
We'd like to wish you a happy birthday.

1913
01:09:26,718 --> 01:09:28,087
Could you come with us?

1914
01:09:28,088 --> 01:09:29,287
We'll wish you a happy birthday. Hold on.

1915
01:09:29,288 --> 01:09:31,396
- I'll bring the cake.
- Have a seat here.

1916
01:09:31,397 --> 01:09:32,658
Bring the cake.

1917
01:09:34,928 --> 01:09:36,027
(Breathing hard)

1918
01:09:36,227 --> 01:09:37,327
(He's in low spirit from failing repeatedly.)

1919
01:09:37,328 --> 01:09:38,397
Sang Uk.

1920
01:09:38,437 --> 01:09:41,606
- We found one. She came in.
- What?

1921
01:09:41,607 --> 01:09:42,867
Someone whose birthday is this week came in.

1922
01:09:42,868 --> 01:09:45,408
The woman dressed in black?

1923
01:09:46,137 --> 01:09:48,908
- Her birthday is this week.
- I passed by her.

1924
01:09:49,777 --> 01:09:52,717
- I didn't think it was possible.
- Do you have an ID...

1925
01:09:52,718 --> 01:09:54,378
or something like that?

1926
01:09:54,548 --> 01:09:55,917
- Here it is.
- This is...

1927
01:09:55,918 --> 01:09:57,118
I'll cover everything else.

1928
01:09:57,248 --> 01:09:59,457
- This Sunday.
- December 29.

1929
01:09:59,458 --> 01:10:01,687
It's this Sunday.

1930
01:10:02,727 --> 01:10:04,627
Na Rae. Seriously...

1931
01:10:04,628 --> 01:10:05,696
(You're the best.)

1932
01:10:05,697 --> 01:10:06,927
This is crazy.

1933
01:10:06,928 --> 01:10:08,567
We'll congratulate you.

1934
01:10:08,597 --> 01:10:11,026
What do you do for work?

1935
01:10:11,027 --> 01:10:12,766
I'm not working yet.

1936
01:10:12,767 --> 01:10:15,007
I'm taking classes to look for a job.

1937
01:10:15,008 --> 01:10:17,667
- You're looking for a job now?
- Yes.

1938
01:10:17,668 --> 01:10:20,276
We'll sing and wish you a new job too.

1939
01:10:20,277 --> 01:10:21,647
We'll congratulate you.

1940
01:10:21,847 --> 01:10:24,946
Wish for getting a job before blowing out the candles.

1941
01:10:24,947 --> 01:10:26,078
- Okay.
- Make your wish.

1942
01:10:26,248 --> 01:10:28,386
- Happy Birthday to you, Na Rae - Happy Birthday to you

1943
01:10:28,387 --> 01:10:30,446
- Happy Birthday to you, Na Rae - Happy Birthday to you

1944
01:10:30,447 --> 01:10:32,787
- To our dear Na Rae - To our dear Na Rae

1945
01:10:32,788 --> 01:10:34,687
- Happy Birthday to you - Happy Birthday to you

1946
01:10:34,788 --> 01:10:36,588
(Congratulatory firecrackers)

1947
01:10:36,658 --> 01:10:37,658
(Blowing)

1948
01:10:38,428 --> 01:10:40,658
- Happy Birthday.
- Happy Birthday.

1949
01:10:41,227 --> 01:10:44,168
Na Rae, we'll wrap this for you.

1950
01:10:44,567 --> 01:10:46,436
It'll be hard to eat it now.

1951
01:10:46,437 --> 01:10:49,136
- Also...
- You're a fairy of victory.

1952
01:10:49,137 --> 01:10:50,507
- Right.
- I'm serious.

1953
01:10:50,508 --> 01:10:52,177
Na Rae, this is for you.

1954
01:10:52,178 --> 01:10:53,237
I'll put it in the back.

1955
01:10:53,508 --> 01:10:55,678
You can take it later, okay?

1956
01:10:55,748 --> 01:10:57,248
The thing is,

1957
01:10:57,307 --> 01:10:59,418
- we bought it for ourselves.
- Okay.

1958
01:10:59,517 --> 01:11:02,016
Say, "No stress." One, two, three.

1959
01:11:02,017 --> 01:11:03,417
- No stress.
- No stress.

1960
01:11:03,418 --> 01:11:04,548
(No stress)

1961
01:11:07,088 --> 01:11:08,758
(Impressed)

1962
01:11:09,158 --> 01:11:10,687
- Nonsan strawberries are the best.
- Nonsan strawberries are the best.

1963
01:11:11,227 --> 01:11:12,257
Would you like one more?

1964
01:11:12,258 --> 01:11:13,657
- No, it's okay.
- Look at the color.

1965
01:11:13,658 --> 01:11:15,368
- Shall we take a selfie?
- Okay.

1966
01:11:15,428 --> 01:11:16,428
One, two, three.

1967
01:11:17,968 --> 01:11:20,096
- Thank you, Na Rae.
- Thank you.

1968
01:11:20,097 --> 01:11:21,338
- Thank you, Na Rae.
- Thank you.

1969
01:11:21,408 --> 01:11:22,637
How did this happen?

1970
01:11:22,737 --> 01:11:24,707
I can't believe it. We came here to buy a cake...

1971
01:11:24,708 --> 01:11:26,708
- and found a birthday girl.
- Seriously.

1972
01:11:26,838 --> 01:11:29,008
Okay. We shouldn't be too absorbed in this moment.

1973
01:11:29,078 --> 01:11:30,378
- All right.
- We need to come up with a plan.

1974
01:11:30,447 --> 01:11:31,976
- All right.
- Shall we check their location?

1975
01:11:31,977 --> 01:11:34,417
We'll use the identification card before we decide where to go.

1976
01:11:34,418 --> 01:11:35,986
- We need to use it.
- No stress.

1977
01:11:35,987 --> 01:11:37,487
We'll check.

1978
01:11:38,258 --> 01:11:40,088
The cake! We need to give her the cake!

1979
01:11:40,687 --> 01:11:41,758
Na Rae.

1980
01:11:41,887 --> 01:11:43,886
Hurry up and check the location.

1981
01:11:43,887 --> 01:11:45,057
Put them to sleep if they're coming.

1982
01:11:45,527 --> 01:11:47,257
Na Rae, you forgot the cake.

1983
01:11:47,258 --> 01:11:48,526
(Na Rae, you forgot the cake.)

1984
01:11:48,527 --> 01:11:49,896
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1985
01:11:49,897 --> 01:11:52,266
- Thank you so much. Be healthy.
- Thank you for congratulating me.

1986
01:11:52,267 --> 01:11:53,267
(Bowing)

1987
01:11:53,368 --> 01:11:55,208
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1988
01:11:56,338 --> 01:11:58,136
- Did you give it to her? Okay.
- Yes.

1989
01:11:58,137 --> 01:11:59,276
Let's hurry up and check their location.

1990
01:11:59,277 --> 01:12:01,548
We might need to put them to sleep. It'll be bad if they arrive.

1991
01:12:02,908 --> 01:12:04,048
It's here.

1992
01:12:05,277 --> 01:12:06,717
(Team Handsome's location is delivered.)

1993
01:12:06,718 --> 01:12:08,288
- For goodness' sake.
- What?

1994
01:12:08,548 --> 01:12:10,647
They're inside the museum. Look.

1995
01:12:10,748 --> 01:12:12,857
- Gilt-bronze Incense Burner. Wait.
- They went with Buyeo A.

1996
01:12:13,758 --> 01:12:15,957
- Right now...
- Then we need to go to Seosan.

1997
01:12:15,958 --> 01:12:17,957
(Seosan: Rock-Carved Triad Buddha)

1998
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:20,328
They blocked our path and took this square.

1999
01:12:20,428 --> 01:12:22,628
- We have to take Seosan.
- You're right.

2000
01:12:23,067 --> 01:12:25,937
If we take Seosan, they won't be able to make a bingo.

2001
01:12:26,637 --> 01:12:27,736
Let's do that.

2002
01:12:27,737 --> 01:12:29,437
We'll move to Seosan.

2003
01:12:30,968 --> 01:12:32,077
Let's go.

2004
01:12:32,078 --> 01:12:34,007
(Team Handsome)

2005
01:12:34,008 --> 01:12:35,806
Buyeo National Museum.

2006
01:12:35,807 --> 01:12:38,317
(Buyeo A: Gilt-bronze Incense Burner of Baekje)

2007
01:12:39,178 --> 01:12:42,417
(It's a treasure among treasures that shines in its golden hue.)

2008
01:12:42,418 --> 01:12:43,516
Buyeo.

2009
01:12:43,517 --> 01:12:45,788
- Hello.
- Hello.

2010
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:48,158
Welcome to the Buyeo National Museum.

2011
01:12:48,227 --> 01:12:49,726
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

2012
01:12:49,727 --> 01:12:51,497
I'm a curator-researcher...

2013
01:12:51,498 --> 01:12:53,827
who works at the museum, Shin Min Chul.

2014
01:12:53,828 --> 01:12:57,367
I'm very happy to show the treasures of Buyeo...

2015
01:12:57,368 --> 01:12:59,066
and Baekje.

2016
01:12:59,067 --> 01:13:00,537
I'm in your care.

2017
01:13:00,538 --> 01:13:02,566
Buyeo National Museum was built...

2018
01:13:02,567 --> 01:13:06,578
in 1945 right after liberation.

2019
01:13:06,807 --> 01:13:09,547
It has been about 80 years since the museum opened.

2020
01:13:09,548 --> 01:13:11,718
(Buyeo National Museum welcomed its 80th anniversary in 2025.)

2021
01:13:11,817 --> 01:13:14,748
You'll now take a look at the various artifacts.

2022
01:13:14,918 --> 01:13:17,186
Artifacts from Buyeo and South Chungcheong region...

2023
01:13:17,187 --> 01:13:18,217
before Baekje,

2024
01:13:18,218 --> 01:13:20,957
artifacts from Baekje, and donated artifacts...

2025
01:13:20,958 --> 01:13:22,758
make up the exhibition.

2026
01:13:22,788 --> 01:13:24,328
- Let's go that way.
- Okay.

2027
01:13:24,687 --> 01:13:27,026
You'll check out the prehistoric artifacts...

2028
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:28,027
and culture of Buyeo.

2029
01:13:28,028 --> 01:13:30,627
The prehistoric artifacts and culture of Buyeo.

2030
01:13:30,628 --> 01:13:31,896
(Prehistoric artifacts of Buyeo)

2031
01:13:31,897 --> 01:13:33,066
There are so many artifacts.

2032
01:13:33,067 --> 01:13:34,196
(Most prehistoric artifacts of Buyeo come from the Bronze Age.)

2033
01:13:34,197 --> 01:13:35,437
(Bronzeware was made based on the advanced agriculture.)

2034
01:13:35,908 --> 01:13:37,168
What? This is incredible.

2035
01:13:37,868 --> 01:13:39,137
I know what it is.

2036
01:13:39,508 --> 01:13:40,708
- This one.
- Earthenware.

2037
01:13:41,008 --> 01:13:43,647
It's from the Bronze Age.

2038
01:13:44,678 --> 01:13:46,277
Isn't the Mumun pottery...

2039
01:13:46,317 --> 01:13:47,718
from the Bronze Age?

2040
01:13:47,878 --> 01:13:49,186
- You're right.
- Right?

2041
01:13:49,187 --> 01:13:50,446
- Yes.
- He keeps talking...

2042
01:13:50,447 --> 01:13:52,557
about the things he knows.

2043
01:13:52,687 --> 01:13:55,526
- You keep wasting time.
- I'm sorry.

2044
01:13:55,527 --> 01:13:58,186
- I see why we keep falling behind.
- He's like a spy.

2045
01:13:58,187 --> 01:13:59,226
Mumum pottery.

2046
01:13:59,227 --> 01:14:00,928
(Laughing)

2047
01:14:01,328 --> 01:14:02,498
Stone knife.

2048
01:14:02,697 --> 01:14:04,997
Semilunar-shaped stone knife. Spindle whorl.

2049
01:14:04,998 --> 01:14:06,967
- You're right. You know well.
- Sir,

2050
01:14:06,968 --> 01:14:08,368
- please don't mind him. Keep going.
- Okay.

2051
01:14:09,307 --> 01:14:10,736
(Dong Hyun continues to check out the exhibition.)

2052
01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:12,476
Tae Hyun, it's a semilunar-shaped stone knife.

2053
01:14:12,477 --> 01:14:14,976
- It's a representative artifact.
- You're right.

2054
01:14:14,977 --> 01:14:17,646
You grab the semilunar-shaped stone knife...

2055
01:14:17,647 --> 01:14:19,547
- That's right.
- and reap grains like this.

2056
01:14:19,548 --> 01:14:21,817
- You reap grains inward.
- Yes.

2057
01:14:21,887 --> 01:14:24,117
This isn't the time to brag.

2058
01:14:24,118 --> 01:14:25,287
- Dong Hyun.
- Tae Hyun,

2059
01:14:25,288 --> 01:14:27,056
it's so fascinating to see the artifacts from books.

2060
01:14:27,057 --> 01:14:28,757
All right.

2061
01:14:28,758 --> 01:14:29,928
I saw them in books.

2062
01:14:29,987 --> 01:14:31,596
(Very excited)

2063
01:14:31,597 --> 01:14:33,157
- He has the level 5 certificate...
- The level 5 certificate.

2064
01:14:33,158 --> 01:14:34,696
in Korean history.

2065
01:14:34,697 --> 01:14:37,127
it's so fascinating to see the artifacts in real life.

2066
01:14:37,128 --> 01:14:38,896
- He even got the certificate.
- Seriously.

2067
01:14:38,897 --> 01:14:40,137
It's quite impressive.

2068
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:41,908
I didn't expect such a different reaction.

2069
01:14:42,267 --> 01:14:43,436
- Another curator went, - Okay.

2070
01:14:43,437 --> 01:14:44,937
"Level five?"

2071
01:14:45,237 --> 01:14:47,337
"That's for fourth graders."

2072
01:14:47,338 --> 01:14:49,346
I did get the certificate around that age.

2073
01:14:49,347 --> 01:14:50,507
- Really?
- Yes.

2074
01:14:50,508 --> 01:14:52,678
It's okay because you can get the higher level in the future.

2075
01:14:53,078 --> 01:14:54,646
I can't believe he praised me.

2076
01:14:54,647 --> 01:14:56,087
What are these numbers?

2077
01:14:56,088 --> 01:14:58,487
Tae Hyun, don't give up.

2078
01:14:58,758 --> 01:15:00,486
There are various artifacts,

2079
01:15:00,487 --> 01:15:03,887
- but I want to introduce these.
- They're in the middle.

2080
01:15:04,387 --> 01:15:05,658
- That's right.
- They're extraordinary.

2081
01:15:06,958 --> 01:15:09,998
(These artifacts are displayed in the middle of the exhibition.)

2082
01:15:10,067 --> 01:15:11,327
These artifacts...

2083
01:15:11,328 --> 01:15:13,567
are various bronze bells.

2084
01:15:13,697 --> 01:15:17,307
There's a marble inside every bronze bell.

2085
01:15:17,468 --> 01:15:18,837
(Not many bronze artifacts have been excavated.)

2086
01:15:18,838 --> 01:15:20,377
(There are no such examples in other regions in Korea.)

2087
01:15:20,378 --> 01:15:22,677
(The bronze bells show that a unique culture...)

2088
01:15:22,678 --> 01:15:24,847
(was existent in the Southern region during the Bronze Age.)

2089
01:15:24,908 --> 01:15:28,077
When you shook the bells, they made ringing sounds...

2090
01:15:28,078 --> 01:15:31,247
and drew people's attention.

2091
01:15:31,248 --> 01:15:32,957
They're important artifacts of prestige.

2092
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:34,856
- Prestige.
- Chief priests...

2093
01:15:34,857 --> 01:15:36,787
- and chieftains would've used them.
- Chieftains.

2094
01:15:36,788 --> 01:15:38,288
(They were used by people of high status.)

2095
01:15:39,197 --> 01:15:42,367
(Fascinated)

2096
01:15:42,368 --> 01:15:44,167
If you read the description,

2097
01:15:44,168 --> 01:15:45,367
these artifacts...

2098
01:15:45,368 --> 01:15:47,337
are a part of the donation from the late Lee Kun Hee,

2099
01:15:47,338 --> 01:15:49,306
the CEO of Samsung.

2100
01:15:49,307 --> 01:15:50,537
- Really?
- So...

2101
01:15:50,538 --> 01:15:54,678
you can see some writings on the back.

2102
01:15:55,647 --> 01:15:56,677
His name is on them.

2103
01:15:56,678 --> 01:15:58,816
(There are writings on the artifacts.)

2104
01:15:58,817 --> 01:16:01,047
The National Museum of Korea took about 20,000 artifacts...

2105
01:16:01,048 --> 01:16:03,747
that were donated by the late Lee Kun Hee.

2106
01:16:03,748 --> 01:16:07,556
To organize and preserve them in a more systematic way,

2107
01:16:07,557 --> 01:16:11,827
we numbered the artifacts.

2108
01:16:11,828 --> 01:16:13,658
(They're numbered using a special solution.)

2109
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:16,397
This is what we want to see, the Gilt-bronze Incense Burner.

2110
01:16:16,727 --> 01:16:18,026
This is it.

2111
01:16:18,027 --> 01:16:20,766
(Let's see the Gilt-bronze Incense Burner of Baekje!)

2112
01:16:20,767 --> 01:16:23,066
Is that the incense burner?

2113
01:16:23,067 --> 01:16:25,737
Yes. It's the Gilt-bronze Incense Burner of Baekje.

2114
01:16:25,878 --> 01:16:27,578
(The Gilt-bronze Incense Burner of Baekje)

2115
01:16:31,347 --> 01:16:32,577
It's the treasure among treasures.

2116
01:16:32,578 --> 01:16:33,877
It's the best treasure of Baekje.

2117
01:16:33,878 --> 01:16:35,446
It's the treasure that can't leave the country.

2118
01:16:35,447 --> 01:16:38,887
It's the treasure among treasures that's beyond all words.

2119
01:16:40,057 --> 01:16:42,257
(It's a big incense burner from the 7th century.)

2120
01:16:42,258 --> 01:16:44,386
(The creativity and sculpting skills of the Baekje period...)

2121
01:16:44,387 --> 01:16:46,457
(make it the essence of the Baekje culture.)

2122
01:16:46,458 --> 01:16:48,897
I guess we can't see it. Can we see it?

2123
01:16:49,397 --> 01:16:52,066
Currently, the incense burner isn't displayed...

2124
01:16:52,067 --> 01:16:54,537
in the Buyeo National Museum.

2125
01:16:54,538 --> 01:16:55,606
I see.

2126
01:16:55,607 --> 01:16:58,236
This is the display cabinet of the incense burner.

2127
01:16:58,237 --> 01:16:59,476
- Is it someplace else right now?
- Yes.

2128
01:16:59,477 --> 01:17:02,578
It's currently displayed in the Daegu National Museum.

2129
01:17:02,647 --> 01:17:07,377
In exchange of that artifact, these artifacts visited the museum.

2130
01:17:07,378 --> 01:17:10,287
The national treasures were borrowed to the museums.

2131
01:17:10,288 --> 01:17:12,087
- I didn't know such things existed.
- That's right.

2132
01:17:12,088 --> 01:17:13,487
Gosh, this is...

2133
01:17:14,187 --> 01:17:16,486
Since you can't see the incense burner right now,

2134
01:17:16,487 --> 01:17:20,027
we prepared a replica.

2135
01:17:20,197 --> 01:17:23,567
It isn't something we do normally,

2136
01:17:23,628 --> 01:17:26,997
but we'll replicate how it was used to burn incense.

2137
01:17:26,998 --> 01:17:29,037
Let's go and take a look.

2138
01:17:29,038 --> 01:17:33,237
(Shall we go and check out the Gilt-bronze Incense Burner?)

2139
01:17:34,038 --> 01:17:35,077
(Startled)

2140
01:17:35,078 --> 01:17:36,207
What's this?

2141
01:17:36,208 --> 01:17:37,347
(Startled)

2142
01:17:40,317 --> 01:17:41,577
I can smell incense.

2143
01:17:41,578 --> 01:17:42,718
It's no joke.

2144
01:17:43,887 --> 01:17:45,117
It smells nice.

2145
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:49,187
(Gilt-bronze Incense Burner of Baekje awaits Team Handsome.)

2146
01:17:49,828 --> 01:17:52,257
- So this is a replication...
- I see.

2147
01:17:52,258 --> 01:17:53,757
of how it was used.

2148
01:17:53,758 --> 01:17:56,997
Back then, they made an incense burner...

2149
01:17:56,998 --> 01:17:58,797
in which smoke could come out of these holes.

2150
01:17:58,798 --> 01:18:00,596
- That's right.
- It's impressive.

2151
01:18:00,597 --> 01:18:02,908
- It's so cool.
- Seriously.

2152
01:18:03,137 --> 01:18:04,707
- It's the best national treasure.
- I got goosebumps.

2153
01:18:04,708 --> 01:18:06,837
There are no other artifacts that look like...

2154
01:18:06,838 --> 01:18:09,607
- the Gilt-bronze Incense Burner.
- The most powerful person...

2155
01:18:09,748 --> 01:18:11,977
If you look inside,

2156
01:18:12,147 --> 01:18:14,146
there's everything. Animals and...

2157
01:18:14,147 --> 01:18:16,486
- This is incredible.
- What's this called?

2158
01:18:16,487 --> 01:18:19,486
It's 1 of the 5 musicians.

2159
01:18:19,487 --> 01:18:22,158
- There are five.
- I see.

2160
01:18:22,758 --> 01:18:24,226
(The 5 musicians are playing...)

2161
01:18:24,227 --> 01:18:25,657
(the string instrument, moon lute, baeso, tungso, and drum.)

2162
01:18:25,658 --> 01:18:27,298
(These instruments are judged to be widely used in Baekje.)

2163
01:18:27,897 --> 01:18:29,297
That's the prediction.

2164
01:18:29,298 --> 01:18:31,226
- Is it a specific shape?
- So...

2165
01:18:31,227 --> 01:18:33,266
the bottom is the stand.

2166
01:18:33,267 --> 01:18:34,997
It's the shape of a dragon that supports...

2167
01:18:34,998 --> 01:18:36,707
- the incense burner.
- It's a dragon.

2168
01:18:36,708 --> 01:18:38,707
(The stand is a dragon that supports the incense burner.)

2169
01:18:38,708 --> 01:18:42,646
A dragon supports a lotus flower.

2170
01:18:42,647 --> 01:18:44,306
(The body is a lotus flower in full bloom.)

2171
01:18:44,307 --> 01:18:46,946
The lid has the shapes of various mountains...

2172
01:18:46,947 --> 01:18:49,846
as well as various animals, people,

2173
01:18:49,847 --> 01:18:52,887
and plants. On top of them...

2174
01:18:53,057 --> 01:18:56,886
is the phoenix that watches over the sky.

2175
01:18:56,887 --> 01:18:58,597
(The phoenix of Baekje that watches over the sky)

2176
01:18:59,197 --> 01:19:02,667
There are a squirrel and a rabbit.

2177
01:19:02,668 --> 01:19:04,927
When the mold gets used 2 or 3 times,

2178
01:19:04,928 --> 01:19:08,497
the details get destroyed. So things can't be made the same.

2179
01:19:08,498 --> 01:19:10,507
When you make an artifact using the beeswax casting method,

2180
01:19:10,508 --> 01:19:12,736
the mold can only be used once.

2181
01:19:12,737 --> 01:19:15,607
That's why this is the one and only artifact.

2182
01:19:15,678 --> 01:19:18,007
- There's an otter.
- Yes. So...

2183
01:19:18,008 --> 01:19:21,017
there are two holes for the smoke on the chest of the phoenix.

2184
01:19:21,178 --> 01:19:22,647
I see a man riding a horse.

2185
01:19:22,847 --> 01:19:25,417
There are 5 smoke holes behind the 5 musicians...

2186
01:19:25,418 --> 01:19:27,757
and 5 smoke holes in front of the 5 musicians.

2187
01:19:27,758 --> 01:19:31,186
In total, there are 12 holes in the incense burner.

2188
01:19:31,187 --> 01:19:33,327
(The Gilt-bronze Incense Burner has a total of 12 smoke holes.)

2189
01:19:33,328 --> 01:19:36,196
- Smoke is coming out of his head.
- That's right.

2190
01:19:36,197 --> 01:19:39,097
- He must be very angry.
- That's right.

2191
01:19:39,597 --> 01:19:41,367
It must've taken a long time to make this.

2192
01:19:41,368 --> 01:19:42,636
I'll show you the inside.

2193
01:19:42,637 --> 01:19:44,167
- Would you like to see this side?
- Yes.

2194
01:19:44,168 --> 01:19:45,207
I'm curious.

2195
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:47,306
- If you look inside...
- Is the inside the same?

2196
01:19:47,307 --> 01:19:49,008
The inside is the same.

2197
01:19:49,048 --> 01:19:50,646
If you feel it with your hands...

2198
01:19:50,647 --> 01:19:52,446
It looks like a helmet.

2199
01:19:52,447 --> 01:19:53,516
(Carefree)

2200
01:19:53,517 --> 01:19:55,717
- It looks like a prince's head.
- You saw correctly.

2201
01:19:55,718 --> 01:19:58,187
People who excavated it for the first time...

2202
01:19:58,248 --> 01:20:01,587
- wondered what it was.
- It's the size of the head.

2203
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:03,026
- It fits the size of the head.
- So...

2204
01:20:03,027 --> 01:20:05,396
they went, "Isn't it a helmet?"

2205
01:20:05,397 --> 01:20:06,856
After the excavation was complete, they saw...

2206
01:20:06,857 --> 01:20:08,327
- that it was an incense burner.
- Really?

2207
01:20:08,328 --> 01:20:10,066
It wasn't obvious at first.

2208
01:20:10,067 --> 01:20:11,727
(They learned later that it was an incense burner.)

2209
01:20:12,668 --> 01:20:15,736
In 1993, an excavation investigation took place...

2210
01:20:15,737 --> 01:20:19,637
in order to make a parking lot.

2211
01:20:19,807 --> 01:20:22,208
Inside the hole of what was a blacksmith's workshop,

2212
01:20:22,277 --> 01:20:26,777
the incense burner was found in a separated state.

2213
01:20:27,248 --> 01:20:29,146
I think I saw it in the news.

2214
01:20:29,147 --> 01:20:30,748
- That's right.
- It hasn't been that long.

2215
01:20:30,847 --> 01:20:32,486
I was in sixth grade.

2216
01:20:32,487 --> 01:20:33,787
- Do you remember that?
- I wouldn't have remembered it.

2217
01:20:33,788 --> 01:20:35,357
But it was on the news so many times.

2218
01:20:35,428 --> 01:20:37,356
- That's why I still remember.
- Really?

2219
01:20:37,357 --> 01:20:39,427
- The Gilt-bronze Incense Burner.
- That's incredible.

2220
01:20:39,428 --> 01:20:42,226
- It was all over the news.
- That's right.

2221
01:20:42,227 --> 01:20:43,566
- My goodness.
- So it's made up...

2222
01:20:43,567 --> 01:20:45,896
of a dragon at the bottom, a lotus flower,

2223
01:20:45,897 --> 01:20:49,538
mountains in the body, and a phoenix.

2224
01:20:49,637 --> 01:20:51,468
It's a well-shaped sculpture.

2225
01:20:51,567 --> 01:20:52,976
It's the national treasure,

2226
01:20:52,977 --> 01:20:54,476
the Gilt-bronze Incense Burner of Baekje...

2227
01:20:54,477 --> 01:20:56,208
and it's highly precious.

2228
01:20:57,447 --> 01:20:58,878
- You all saw it well, right?
- Yes.

2229
01:20:59,218 --> 01:21:00,678
- Here's the quiz.
- Right.

2230
01:21:01,447 --> 01:21:03,717
On the Gilt-bronze Incense Burner of Baekje,

2231
01:21:03,718 --> 01:21:05,556
there are a lot of animals.

2232
01:21:05,557 --> 01:21:07,218
I saw a lot of them.

2233
01:21:07,557 --> 01:21:09,288
There are 40 animals on the lid.

2234
01:21:09,557 --> 01:21:10,557
Gosh.

2235
01:21:10,558 --> 01:21:13,356
There are 27 animals on the body.

2236
01:21:13,357 --> 01:21:14,527
Right. There are a lot of them.

2237
01:21:14,758 --> 01:21:16,867
The fascinating part is that...

2238
01:21:16,868 --> 01:21:18,597
there are animals on it that weren't in our country back then.

2239
01:21:19,038 --> 01:21:21,037
Out of the following,

2240
01:21:21,038 --> 01:21:23,107
which animal is not on the Gilt-bronze Incense Burner?

2241
01:21:24,868 --> 01:21:26,507
It's still a multiple choice question.

2242
01:21:26,508 --> 01:21:27,577
- It's a multiple choice question.
- Do you remember?

2243
01:21:27,578 --> 01:21:28,776
- I saw a lot of them.
- You saw a lot of them, right?

2244
01:21:28,777 --> 01:21:29,947
- I saw a lot of them.
- Okay!

2245
01:21:30,347 --> 01:21:31,606
- I saw a lot of them.
- I couldn't really tell...

2246
01:21:31,607 --> 01:21:32,678
what they were.

2247
01:21:32,977 --> 01:21:35,078
Which animal is not on the Gilt-bronze Incense Burner?

2248
01:21:36,048 --> 01:21:38,316
- Number one, elephant.
- Okay.

2249
01:21:38,317 --> 01:21:39,317
- Did you see it?
- I did.

2250
01:21:39,317 --> 01:21:40,317
Okay!

2251
01:21:40,887 --> 01:21:42,757
I saw it. I really saw it.

2252
01:21:42,758 --> 01:21:44,226
- I watched carefully.
- Okay.

2253
01:21:44,227 --> 01:21:45,526
- I saw it.
- Okay.

2254
01:21:45,527 --> 01:21:47,027
Number two, monkey.

2255
01:21:48,027 --> 01:21:50,066
- I saw a monkey.
- Really?

2256
01:21:50,067 --> 01:21:52,397
I think I saw it. I remember seeing it.

2257
01:21:52,998 --> 01:21:54,298
Number three, crocodile.

2258
01:21:55,038 --> 01:21:56,607
- I don't think I saw a crocodile.
- Crocodile?

2259
01:21:56,908 --> 01:21:58,037
- I didn't see a crocodile.
- Crocodile?

2260
01:21:58,038 --> 01:21:59,707
It's over if number four is something I've seen.

2261
01:21:59,708 --> 01:22:01,277
- Right.
- I'm not quite sure.

2262
01:22:01,437 --> 01:22:03,346
Number four, camel.

2263
01:22:03,347 --> 01:22:05,817
(Number 4, camel)

2264
01:22:06,078 --> 01:22:08,378
- Tae Hyun.
- Did you see a camel?

2265
01:22:09,048 --> 01:22:11,217
- I remember seeing an elephant.
- Right.

2266
01:22:11,218 --> 01:22:12,857
But that might be a camel.

2267
01:22:13,118 --> 01:22:14,287
Then what about the elephant?

2268
01:22:14,288 --> 01:22:17,257
(Then what about the elephant?)

2269
01:22:17,258 --> 01:22:18,356
(Confused)

2270
01:22:18,357 --> 01:22:20,428
- What do we do then?
- But...

2271
01:22:20,628 --> 01:22:23,066
it's different on both sides.

2272
01:22:23,067 --> 01:22:24,297
I looked around the whole incense burner.

2273
01:22:24,298 --> 01:22:26,337
I saw all of the animals on my side.

2274
01:22:26,338 --> 01:22:29,136
There was one that was standing like this like a monkey.

2275
01:22:29,137 --> 01:22:30,837
- I think the monkey is on it.
- I'm sure there's a monkey.

2276
01:22:30,838 --> 01:22:32,636
- I think the elephant is on it too.
- The elephant is certainly there.

2277
01:22:32,637 --> 01:22:33,877
I think the camel will be on it too.

2278
01:22:33,878 --> 01:22:37,247
It isn't hard to express the camel.

2279
01:22:37,248 --> 01:22:38,407
The bumps are just like this.

2280
01:22:38,408 --> 01:22:39,548
But for the crocodile...

2281
01:22:40,447 --> 01:22:43,347
- Can the crocodile be on it?
- The crocodile...

2282
01:22:43,517 --> 01:22:45,087
The crocodile...

2283
01:22:45,088 --> 01:22:46,186
(Thinking)

2284
01:22:46,187 --> 01:22:48,157
I think it'll be hard to express the crocodile.

2285
01:22:48,158 --> 01:22:50,056
I think the crocodile is the one that isn't on it.

2286
01:22:50,057 --> 01:22:51,186
- Right.
- It's because...

2287
01:22:51,187 --> 01:22:53,696
the animals that were drawn on the incense burner...

2288
01:22:53,697 --> 01:22:56,797
seemed like animals that brought good luck or were strong.

2289
01:22:56,798 --> 01:22:57,896
The crocodile isn't a good match, right?

2290
01:22:57,897 --> 01:23:00,337
The crocodile seems a bit off.

2291
01:23:00,338 --> 01:23:01,936
Right.

2292
01:23:01,937 --> 01:23:03,106
The crocodile doesn't seem like a good match.

2293
01:23:03,107 --> 01:23:04,436
Let's quickly get over this and leave.

2294
01:23:04,437 --> 01:23:05,476
Crocodile.

2295
01:23:05,477 --> 01:23:07,077
You have chosen number 3, crocodile.

2296
01:23:07,078 --> 01:23:08,078
Right.

2297
01:23:08,137 --> 01:23:11,977
(Is it the right answer?)

2298
01:23:12,878 --> 01:23:13,878
Incorrect.

2299
01:23:15,378 --> 01:23:18,317
We were too hasty.

2300
01:23:18,788 --> 01:23:20,686
(Screaming)

2301
01:23:20,687 --> 01:23:22,686
(We were too hasty.)

2302
01:23:22,687 --> 01:23:24,158
- Gosh.
- It's incorrect?

2303
01:23:25,258 --> 01:23:26,527
We were too hasty.

2304
01:23:27,128 --> 01:23:28,128
Hold on.

2305
01:23:28,129 --> 01:23:30,067
How is the other team getting it all correct?

2306
01:23:30,397 --> 01:23:31,468
Seriously.

2307
01:23:31,697 --> 01:23:34,097
This was the thing you mentioned in the car.

2308
01:23:34,468 --> 01:23:37,607
The one with the reattempt card becomes careless.

2309
01:23:38,708 --> 01:23:40,776
Having the reattempt card...

2310
01:23:40,777 --> 01:23:42,007
makes you feel relaxed.

2311
01:23:42,008 --> 01:23:43,577
If you don't have it, you move around so much.

2312
01:23:43,578 --> 01:23:45,646
(Chuckling)

2313
01:23:45,647 --> 01:23:49,016
You were too hasty!

2314
01:23:49,017 --> 01:23:51,288
You should've put more thought into it.

2315
01:23:53,158 --> 01:23:56,356
The camel definitely seems like an animal that will be on it.

2316
01:23:56,357 --> 01:23:58,458
We have to use the card to stop it from getting blocked.

2317
01:23:59,057 --> 01:24:00,928
- We have to use the card.
- The chance card.

2318
01:24:01,697 --> 01:24:03,097
We should've saved it for the last one.

2319
01:24:03,397 --> 01:24:05,797
(Please hand it over here.)

2320
01:24:05,798 --> 01:24:07,668
How did we not get this?

2321
01:24:07,968 --> 01:24:10,408
Gosh, Tae Hyun. The reattempt card...

2322
01:24:11,008 --> 01:24:12,977
You have used the reattempt card.

2323
01:24:13,937 --> 01:24:15,907
Gosh. I saw all of them.

2324
01:24:15,908 --> 01:24:17,276
I should've looked at it a lot more closely.

2325
01:24:17,277 --> 01:24:18,747
(Blaming himself)

2326
01:24:18,748 --> 01:24:20,118
Here's your hint.

2327
01:24:21,447 --> 01:24:23,887
It's the elephant or camel.

2328
01:24:24,187 --> 01:24:25,187
What?

2329
01:24:25,248 --> 01:24:27,117
(It's the elephant or camel?)

2330
01:24:27,118 --> 01:24:28,588
I'm certain that I saw the elephant.

2331
01:24:28,758 --> 01:24:30,427
- Then it's the camel.
- Hold on. Time out.

2332
01:24:30,428 --> 01:24:31,587
- Because of you...
- Hold on.

2333
01:24:31,588 --> 01:24:33,157
- Wasn't it a camel that I saw?
- Gosh.

2334
01:24:33,158 --> 01:24:34,457
(Wasn't the elephant actually a camel?)

2335
01:24:34,458 --> 01:24:36,167
Listen. This was what I saw.

2336
01:24:36,168 --> 01:24:39,236
It was big and I saw its back.

2337
01:24:39,237 --> 01:24:41,567
You just needed to see the elephant's trunk!

2338
01:24:41,697 --> 01:24:43,607
Did it have its trunk or not?

2339
01:24:43,708 --> 01:24:44,936
The trunk!

2340
01:24:44,937 --> 01:24:48,607
Did its trunk stick out or not?

2341
01:24:48,838 --> 01:24:51,077
The camel would've have its neck high up.

2342
01:24:51,078 --> 01:24:52,217
Look at this.

2343
01:24:52,218 --> 01:24:55,277
This is a camel and this is an elephant.

2344
01:24:55,347 --> 01:24:58,646
(Wobbling)

2345
01:24:58,647 --> 01:25:00,317
Was it this or this?

2346
01:25:00,557 --> 01:25:01,587
(Dong Hyun,)

2347
01:25:01,588 --> 01:25:02,928
(remember what you saw!)

2348
01:25:03,458 --> 01:25:04,487
My gosh.

2349
01:25:04,628 --> 01:25:06,498
I think it's the elephant.

2350
01:25:07,097 --> 01:25:09,097
You definitely saw an elephant?

2351
01:25:09,828 --> 01:25:10,868
Hold on.

2352
01:25:12,168 --> 01:25:14,368
Please!

2353
01:25:14,767 --> 01:25:17,437
This makes no sense. I saw it three times.

2354
01:25:17,968 --> 01:25:19,207
I even said it.

2355
01:25:19,208 --> 01:25:20,936
"There's an elephant." I even said it.

2356
01:25:20,937 --> 01:25:22,748
Then you must be right. You can't possibly...

2357
01:25:23,107 --> 01:25:25,408
If you look carefully, you can see an elephant too.

2358
01:25:25,777 --> 01:25:27,417
You said that you saw an elephant.

2359
01:25:27,418 --> 01:25:28,677
How can that be a camel?

2360
01:25:28,678 --> 01:25:30,486
That means the person who drew it did a bad job.

2361
01:25:30,487 --> 01:25:31,547
Right.

2362
01:25:31,548 --> 01:25:33,486
- Trust yourself.
- I said it was an elephant.

2363
01:25:33,487 --> 01:25:35,517
- How can it be a camel?
- Right.

2364
01:25:35,828 --> 01:25:36,856
Camel. Number four.

2365
01:25:36,857 --> 01:25:39,127
Out of number 1, elephant and number 4, camel...

2366
01:25:39,128 --> 01:25:41,197
- Camel.
- Number four, camel.

2367
01:25:41,897 --> 01:25:43,668
- I trust you. Number four, camel.
- Okay.

2368
01:25:44,027 --> 01:25:45,838
(Feeling anxious)

2369
01:25:46,498 --> 01:25:47,538
Correct.

2370
01:25:47,897 --> 01:25:49,968
Gosh, my legs are giving in!

2371
01:25:51,338 --> 01:25:53,436
(Plopping down)

2372
01:25:53,437 --> 01:25:56,147
(It's finally the right answer.)

2373
01:25:56,548 --> 01:25:59,117
Gosh. My legs gave in.

2374
01:25:59,118 --> 01:26:00,517
We still got it right because of you.

2375
01:26:00,718 --> 01:26:03,016
I thought he was going to say it was incorrect.

2376
01:26:03,017 --> 01:26:04,787
It seems like it would really have a camel.

2377
01:26:04,788 --> 01:26:07,687
No. The elephant is right here.

2378
01:26:08,258 --> 01:26:09,526
Where is it? What is it?

2379
01:26:09,527 --> 01:26:10,527
- This one?
- Is this it?

2380
01:26:10,528 --> 01:26:13,196
(Shall we take a look?)

2381
01:26:13,197 --> 01:26:15,257
The elephant, monkey, and crocodile...

2382
01:26:15,258 --> 01:26:17,327
weren't animals that lived in our country back then.

2383
01:26:17,328 --> 01:26:18,328
The reason they were drawn...

2384
01:26:18,628 --> 01:26:20,736
is assumed to be because of the international exchange,

2385
01:26:20,737 --> 01:26:22,096
acceptance of foreign cultures,

2386
01:26:22,097 --> 01:26:23,606
and spread of animal images that happened amongst...

2387
01:26:23,607 --> 01:26:25,067
the people of Baekje.

2388
01:26:26,477 --> 01:26:28,306
We still got it right thanks to you.

2389
01:26:28,307 --> 01:26:30,107
It's a relief that I saw the elephant.

2390
01:26:32,048 --> 01:26:35,787
(Gilt-bronze Incense Burner of Baekje)

2391
01:26:35,788 --> 01:26:38,548
- Okay.
- We're out of the hint card now.

2392
01:26:38,947 --> 01:26:41,288
- What a waste.
- We don't have the reattempt card.

2393
01:26:41,517 --> 01:26:44,226
It would've been perfect if we didn't use it. Gosh.

2394
01:26:44,227 --> 01:26:46,027
(What will be the future of Team Handsome?)

2395
01:26:46,787 --> 01:26:48,728
(The second half)

2396
01:26:49,497 --> 01:26:51,228
(The man of level 5 in Korean history)

2397
01:26:51,758 --> 01:26:54,298
(Thanks to history genius Dong Hyun,)

2398
01:26:54,728 --> 01:26:56,138
(will Team Handsome get home early?)

2399
01:26:56,298 --> 01:26:59,508
(There's no chance.)

2400
01:26:59,938 --> 01:27:00,938
(Yawning)

2401
01:27:02,808 --> 01:27:06,947
(Team Guys makes progress calmly.)

2402
01:27:07,277 --> 01:27:08,648
(Victory is upon us.)

2403
01:27:08,947 --> 01:27:10,478
(Give me a hug.)

2404
01:27:10,747 --> 01:27:11,947
(I see our future.)

2405
01:27:12,048 --> 01:27:13,417
(It's muddy.)

2406
01:27:13,917 --> 01:27:15,047
(The muddy race begins.)

2407
01:27:15,048 --> 01:27:16,117
Let's go for it.

2408
01:27:16,718 --> 01:27:17,758
(The two teams give it their all!)

2409
01:27:18,117 --> 01:27:20,527
(A battle of brains to take the win)

2410
01:27:20,787 --> 01:27:23,697
(We don't have to take a risk for that situation.)

2411
01:27:23,997 --> 01:27:25,656
(Certainty)

2412
01:27:25,657 --> 01:27:27,527
(Despair)

2413
01:27:27,798 --> 01:27:32,037
(The race gets on a roller coaster.)

2414
01:27:32,438 --> 01:27:34,008
(This is too hard.)

2415
01:27:34,367 --> 01:27:41,247
(You will become a loser the moment you get it wrong.)

2416
01:27:41,607 --> 01:27:45,048
