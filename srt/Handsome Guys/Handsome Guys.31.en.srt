1
00:00:15,496 --> 00:00:17,395
(Is it kimchi stew...)

2
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:19,036
(or doenjang stew?)

3
00:00:19,396 --> 00:00:20,705
(Rice...)

4
00:00:20,706 --> 00:00:22,665
(or noodles?)

5
00:00:22,666 --> 00:00:24,636
(After making the choice...)

6
00:00:25,148 --> 00:00:29,145
(Exultation...)

7
00:00:29,146 --> 00:00:30,646
(and regret)

8
00:00:31,746 --> 00:00:34,516
(The time of abundance)

9
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:36,656
(For modern people who suffer from such a dilemma)

10
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:41,325
(The menu conflict agents, Handsome Guys)

11
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:43,056
(It starts again today.)

12
00:00:43,826 --> 00:00:48,826
(The summer in June with profound greenery)

13
00:00:49,296 --> 00:00:52,565
(Where nature and the city blend together)

14
00:00:52,566 --> 00:00:56,136
(Seongdong-gu, Seoul)

15
00:00:56,336 --> 00:00:59,375
Hello, it's good to see you.

16
00:00:59,376 --> 00:01:01,346
We're in Seongsu-dong. There's good sunlight.

17
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:03,105
Seongsu-dong?

18
00:01:03,106 --> 00:01:04,375
I'm embarrassed to say this,

19
00:01:04,376 --> 00:01:05,616
but I also lived in Seongsu-dong for two years.

20
00:01:05,816 --> 00:01:07,085
- Really? - Yi Kyung.

21
00:01:07,086 --> 00:01:09,145
- I mean... - Where have you never lived?

22
00:01:09,146 --> 00:01:10,416
How old is he?

23
00:01:10,716 --> 00:01:13,086
With 2 years at every place, he must have lived 40 to 50 years.

24
00:01:13,226 --> 00:01:15,685
(Yi Kyung's former hometown, Jamsil...)

25
00:01:15,686 --> 00:01:19,495
(and Namyeong-dong)

26
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,595
I lived two years at an apartment...

27
00:01:20,596 --> 00:01:23,365
behind the fire station right after the Yeongdong Bridge.

28
00:01:23,366 --> 00:01:24,866
So I know this place very well.

29
00:01:25,736 --> 00:01:29,006
(Yi Kyung's hometown in Seoul, to be continued)

30
00:01:29,436 --> 00:01:31,235
- Let's meet our guest... - Right.

31
00:01:31,236 --> 00:01:32,375
- first. - Okay.

32
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:33,576
On every episode,

33
00:01:33,746 --> 00:01:37,276
we've been mentioning our guest of today.

34
00:01:37,416 --> 00:01:39,016
- I see. - We've missed him.

35
00:01:39,746 --> 00:01:41,715
There's light coming from over there.

36
00:01:41,716 --> 00:01:42,745
(There's light coming from over there.)

37
00:01:42,746 --> 00:01:44,756
- My goodness. - A ray of light.

38
00:01:45,256 --> 00:01:47,085
(We welcome a guest who's like a ray of light.)

39
00:01:47,086 --> 00:01:49,456
- Gosh. - It's Rhymer.

40
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:52,295
A really popular man is here.

41
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:53,365
(Rhymer, the head of hip-hop)

42
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:54,366
- Goodness. - Nice to meet you.

43
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:55,566
Rhymer, thank you for the food.

44
00:01:57,166 --> 00:01:58,296
Eight times seven?

45
00:01:59,295 --> 00:02:00,295
Fifty-seven.

46
00:02:00,406 --> 00:02:02,636
(After making Handsome Guys laugh,)

47
00:02:03,236 --> 00:02:06,276
(he paid for Lunch 1 from the start.)

48
00:02:07,176 --> 00:02:09,075
(Didn't I pay for this?)

49
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:10,845
(Paid Lunch 1 and 2)

50
00:02:10,846 --> 00:02:13,585
(Paid Dinner 1)

51
00:02:13,586 --> 00:02:15,346
(Paid Dinner 2)

52
00:02:15,586 --> 00:02:17,056
(He had been generous with us.)

53
00:02:17,686 --> 00:02:20,486
(The legend of four consecutive payments, Rhymer)

54
00:02:20,656 --> 00:02:21,885
As soon as you see him, isn't it harsh to say...

55
00:02:21,886 --> 00:02:23,225
- "thank you for the food?" - Say it, everyone.

56
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,495
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

57
00:02:24,496 --> 00:02:26,426
(We thank you in advance for the food.)

58
00:02:26,556 --> 00:02:27,565
My goodness.

59
00:02:27,566 --> 00:02:29,695
You came back after a long time, so please say hello.

60
00:02:29,696 --> 00:02:30,696
Hello.

61
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:32,766
I'm the sixth member of Handsome Guys.

62
00:02:33,196 --> 00:02:35,166
I'm Rhymer. It's good to see you.

63
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:38,475
- It's good to see you too. - That's true.

64
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:41,976
We also think that you're one of us.

65
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:44,946
- I agree. - Today, I came here...

66
00:02:45,816 --> 00:02:47,046
with a different attitude.

67
00:02:47,316 --> 00:02:48,515
How is it different from back then?

68
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:52,116
Back then, as I was full of confidence,

69
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:53,986
those things happened.

70
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:55,085
"Those things?"

71
00:02:55,086 --> 00:02:56,185
(Those things equal being the 1st to pay 4 consecutive times.)

72
00:02:56,186 --> 00:02:57,526
Today, I'm very calm.

73
00:02:57,726 --> 00:03:00,395
Ever since then, I've been watching Handsome Guys consistently...

74
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:01,695
and did a lot of analysis.

75
00:03:01,696 --> 00:03:02,725
(He watched and analysed.)

76
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:03,765
What was your analysis?

77
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:05,466
I realised the cause of my defeat.

78
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:07,835
- Like what? - What was the cause of your defeat?

79
00:03:07,836 --> 00:03:08,965
What made you fail?

80
00:03:08,966 --> 00:03:11,105
Instead of observing the flow...

81
00:03:11,106 --> 00:03:13,576
and picking things up slowly,

82
00:03:13,646 --> 00:03:15,746
I was being too hasty.

83
00:03:16,816 --> 00:03:20,485
What makes Rhymer interesting is his hastiness.

84
00:03:20,486 --> 00:03:23,616
Today, I'm determined to eat for free no matter what.

85
00:03:23,856 --> 00:03:25,585
I even told my parents about it.

86
00:03:25,586 --> 00:03:27,055
- You told your parents about it? - Your parents?

87
00:03:27,056 --> 00:03:28,056
They were worried about me.

88
00:03:28,057 --> 00:03:29,585
They told me that I paid so much.

89
00:03:29,586 --> 00:03:30,655
- I mean... - Right.

90
00:03:30,656 --> 00:03:32,755
If that's the case, won't it be meaningless...

91
00:03:32,756 --> 00:03:34,625
- to get the appearance fee? - Right.

92
00:03:34,626 --> 00:03:36,495
Since Rhymer brought it up,

93
00:03:36,496 --> 00:03:38,936
I'll say this in case our viewers are in doubt.

94
00:03:39,066 --> 00:03:40,535
I happened to read...

95
00:03:40,536 --> 00:03:41,636
a comment like this.

96
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:44,036
"In any case, the production crew will transfer money..."

97
00:03:44,236 --> 00:03:46,505
"to the members for the meals after the shoot."

98
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:47,506
That's not true.

99
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:50,115
- I swear on everything that I have. - Right.

100
00:03:50,116 --> 00:03:51,446
They don't give us a single penny.

101
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:53,046
It's true.

102
00:03:53,047 --> 00:03:55,485
Then we'd have no reason to play while staking our lives.

103
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:57,485
We're in Seongsu-dong today.

104
00:03:57,486 --> 00:03:59,885
- Where are we going today? - Since I've lived here,

105
00:03:59,886 --> 00:04:01,425
- shall I explain? - Yes.

106
00:04:01,426 --> 00:04:04,696
In the past, Seongsu-dong was known for handmade shoes.

107
00:04:05,726 --> 00:04:06,718
- Shoes? - Yes.

108
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:08,225
There must have been a shoe factory.

109
00:04:08,226 --> 00:04:09,296
(Seongsu-dong Handmade Shoes Street)

110
00:04:10,026 --> 00:04:15,306
(Seongsu-dong was known for its Handmade Shoes Street.)

111
00:04:15,736 --> 00:04:16,935
(In the 1960s, it was designated...)

112
00:04:16,936 --> 00:04:18,205
(as an industrial district in Seoul.)

113
00:04:18,206 --> 00:04:19,505
(There was a cluster of factories such as shoe manufacturing,)

114
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:20,775
(textiles, printing, and metal machinery.)

115
00:04:20,776 --> 00:04:22,846
There were many industrial plants.

116
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:26,315
As you can see, there are many red brick buildings.

117
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:27,385
- Right. - Yes.

118
00:04:27,386 --> 00:04:30,956
(Warehouses and factories were built with red bricks.)

119
00:04:31,086 --> 00:04:33,315
The word "newtro" originated from here.

120
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:35,225
- How so? - Retro and new.

121
00:04:35,226 --> 00:04:37,256
- That's correct. - Inside retro red brick houses,

122
00:04:37,426 --> 00:04:39,556
coffee shops were built.

123
00:04:39,896 --> 00:04:42,266
The idea of "newtro" started in Seongsu-dong.

124
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:43,766
Newtro.

125
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:48,435
(Where hip brands and pop-up stores gather)

126
00:04:48,436 --> 00:04:50,536
(The most popular neighbourhood these days)

127
00:04:51,006 --> 00:04:52,935
I'm itching to talk about this.

128
00:04:52,936 --> 00:04:55,175
There are so many tasty restaurants around here.

129
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:56,176
Yes, there are many.

130
00:04:56,177 --> 00:04:58,145
At this place, wherever you go, everything tastes good.

131
00:04:58,146 --> 00:05:00,015
Even if you stumble upon a restaurant,

132
00:05:00,016 --> 00:05:01,846
- the food is delicious. - Right.

133
00:05:02,086 --> 00:05:03,956
- Today's menu is... - I can't wait to find out.

134
00:05:04,586 --> 00:05:05,656
gomtang.

135
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:07,155
- Gomtang? - Yes.

136
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:08,585
(Seung Ho's pick, the first recommendation: Gomtang)

137
00:05:08,586 --> 00:05:10,696
Handmade burgers that match the vibe of Seongsu-dong.

138
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:13,196
- Handmade burgers? - Handmade burgers?

139
00:05:13,426 --> 00:05:15,495
(Gomtang with hearty water parsley...)

140
00:05:15,496 --> 00:05:17,466
(versus handmade burger with fresh filling)

141
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,896
Is it the place with water parsley?

142
00:05:19,696 --> 00:05:21,465
What? Do you know the restaurant?

143
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:22,635
Isn't it the water parsley place?

144
00:05:22,636 --> 00:05:24,075
- Is that right? - Are you referring to gomtang?

145
00:05:24,076 --> 00:05:25,375
Does the restaurant's name start with "Neung?"

146
00:05:25,376 --> 00:05:26,436
- Water parsley? - That's the place.

147
00:05:26,846 --> 00:05:28,476
I'm an expert of that place.

148
00:05:28,876 --> 00:05:30,346
- Is it a famous restaurant? - I'm an expert.

149
00:05:30,716 --> 00:05:33,546
I guarantee you that I know this restaurant very well.

150
00:05:33,686 --> 00:05:35,686
I also know about the restaurant owner very well.

151
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:37,886
You even know about the restaurant owner?

152
00:05:38,116 --> 00:05:41,986
He and I go and see the same fortune teller.

153
00:05:42,256 --> 00:05:46,056
He and I believe in the same person.

154
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:47,226
That's why...

155
00:05:47,296 --> 00:05:49,426
- Is that your religion? - They share the same religion.

156
00:05:49,666 --> 00:05:50,866
They share the same faith.

157
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:52,065
Gomtang versus handmade burgers?

158
00:05:52,066 --> 00:05:54,266
- It's Korean or western food. - Exactly.

159
00:05:54,436 --> 00:05:57,476
I'm craving broth very much, so I pick gomtang.

160
00:05:58,076 --> 00:05:59,535
That restaurant is good.

161
00:05:59,536 --> 00:06:00,575
That's my choice.

162
00:06:00,576 --> 00:06:02,605
- I know exactly what I want. - What?

163
00:06:02,606 --> 00:06:03,615
I'd like gomtang.

164
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:04,645
- Gomtang? - Yes.

165
00:06:04,646 --> 00:06:05,646
Is there a reason why?

166
00:06:05,647 --> 00:06:07,716
I like gomtang, but what I look forward to is...

167
00:06:08,046 --> 00:06:09,185
eating boiled beef.

168
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:10,415
- Their boiled beef is good. - Right.

169
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,555
- Always. - I pick the handmade burger.

170
00:06:12,556 --> 00:06:13,926
I've been to the gomtang restaurant.

171
00:06:14,756 --> 00:06:16,125
I know how their food tastes.

172
00:06:16,126 --> 00:06:18,055
I pick the handmade burger as well.

173
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:19,126
- You do? - What?

174
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:19,989
I like...

175
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:22,166
handmade burgers.

176
00:06:23,736 --> 00:06:27,135
Tae Hyun likes to eat food that's simple and easy to eat.

177
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,166
That's right.

178
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:29,536
What about you, Dong Hyun?

179
00:06:29,537 --> 00:06:31,836
I like both of them,

180
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:34,145
but I know the entire menu at the gomtang restaurant.

181
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:36,376
- I see. - At the restaurant,

182
00:06:36,746 --> 00:06:37,875
their beef tartare is intense.

183
00:06:37,876 --> 00:06:38,915
- Seriously. - "Beef tartare?"

184
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:41,045
- But this is about gomtang. - It's intense.

185
00:06:41,046 --> 00:06:42,316
- Gomtang. - Yes.

186
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:45,985
I'd really like to go to that restaurant.

187
00:06:45,986 --> 00:06:47,125
- Gomtang? - Yes.

188
00:06:47,126 --> 00:06:48,556
The most frightening taste is the one you know.

189
00:06:49,126 --> 00:06:51,095
We have 3 for gomtang and 2 for handmade burger.

190
00:06:51,096 --> 00:06:53,126
- Let's stand here for gomtang. - Gomtang.

191
00:06:54,726 --> 00:06:56,826
Handmade burger and gomtang.

192
00:06:57,336 --> 00:06:58,765
What about you, sir?

193
00:06:58,766 --> 00:07:00,506
(What will be Rhymer's choice?)

194
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:04,235
What my body wants is gomtang.

195
00:07:04,236 --> 00:07:06,406
Music is playing as soon as Rhymer starts to speak.

196
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,675
Music is playing as soon as Rhymer starts to speak.

197
00:07:08,676 --> 00:07:09,875
(The nearby clothing store drops the beat for the head of hip-hop.)

198
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:11,176
He is here.

199
00:07:11,346 --> 00:07:12,576
This is...

200
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:15,486
I'm craving some gomtang,

201
00:07:15,986 --> 00:07:18,656
but this song is giving me a sign.

202
00:07:19,716 --> 00:07:22,926
It's telling me not to pick gomtang.

203
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:26,395
It's telling me to eat handmade burger instead.

204
00:07:26,396 --> 00:07:28,226
- Handmade burger? - Then...

205
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:30,566
according to this song,

206
00:07:31,366 --> 00:07:35,235
I'll pick handmade burger for today.

207
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:37,106
- The handmade burger sounds nice. - As soon as Rhymer spoke...

208
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:46,046
(They head to Seongsu-dong, the globally popular spot.)

209
00:07:46,846 --> 00:07:47,846
(Seongsu)

210
00:07:47,847 --> 00:07:51,986
(LMR 1, water parsley gomtang)

211
00:07:52,316 --> 00:07:55,325
(Handsome Guys head to the first restaurant.)

212
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:57,496
Can we take a photo like this?

213
00:07:57,756 --> 00:07:59,596
- There's so much hip stuff here. - What's this?

214
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:01,066
- What's this? - There it is.

215
00:08:01,326 --> 00:08:02,695
You all have to come inside the frame.

216
00:08:02,696 --> 00:08:03,936
(They follow Seung Ho and take their position.)

217
00:08:05,296 --> 00:08:08,336
(Generation MZ's unwritten rule: The mirror selfie)

218
00:08:09,406 --> 00:08:13,305
(Handsome Guys' first mirror selfie)

219
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:15,446
Are there things like this on the street?

220
00:08:16,406 --> 00:08:17,646
It's quite trendy.

221
00:08:18,216 --> 00:08:19,476
It looks so popular.

222
00:08:19,616 --> 00:08:22,285
It looks like they stopped in the middle of construction.

223
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:24,215
They exposed the concrete on purpose.

224
00:08:24,216 --> 00:08:25,485
- Are they all like this? - Yes.

225
00:08:25,486 --> 00:08:27,525
(An industrial district in the past)

226
00:08:27,526 --> 00:08:30,226
(Exposed concrete that evokes the old history of Seongsu-dong)

227
00:08:31,056 --> 00:08:32,226
Here it is.

228
00:08:33,196 --> 00:08:35,865
This is the place. You must wait to get in.

229
00:08:35,866 --> 00:08:37,335
(Today's restaurant is located on the main street in Seongsu-dong.)

230
00:08:37,336 --> 00:08:38,396
Oh, my goodness.

231
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:40,766
(Water Parsley)

232
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:43,106
(Waiting is a must.)

233
00:08:44,336 --> 00:08:48,645
(Not only the 1st floor)

234
00:08:48,646 --> 00:08:51,446
(The 2nd floor is also filled with customers.)

235
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:54,345
(Famous people also come here often.)

236
00:08:54,346 --> 00:08:56,846
(Dong Hyun and Sang Uk have been here.)

237
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,355
As the dish was unusual,

238
00:08:58,356 --> 00:08:59,756
I came to try it.

239
00:08:59,856 --> 00:09:02,326
It's easy to eat and delicious.

240
00:09:02,756 --> 00:09:05,956
(An unusual combo of fragrant water parsley and gomtang)

241
00:09:06,856 --> 00:09:10,495
(LMR 1, water parsley gomtang)

242
00:09:10,496 --> 00:09:13,905
I expected the inside of the restaurant to be fancy,

243
00:09:13,906 --> 00:09:15,405
but actually,

244
00:09:15,406 --> 00:09:16,565
- On the contrary, - it looks like an old restaurant.

245
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:18,876
- tasty restaurants have this vibe. - Right.

246
00:09:18,976 --> 00:09:21,045
- Dong Hyun, it's my 1st time here. - It's your 1st time?

247
00:09:21,046 --> 00:09:22,375
I'll explain everything.

248
00:09:22,376 --> 00:09:24,015
Then I won't even look at the menu.

249
00:09:24,016 --> 00:09:25,475
- First of all... - I'll order anything you say.

250
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:26,945
I like everything, but...

251
00:09:26,946 --> 00:09:28,515
Beef tartare, water parsley beef hot pot,

252
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:30,385
- gomtang, beef tartare bibimbap. - Beef tartare bibimbap.

253
00:09:30,386 --> 00:09:32,016
I strongly recommend these.

254
00:09:32,256 --> 00:09:33,615
As soon as I saw the menu,

255
00:09:33,616 --> 00:09:35,656
I got very annoyed.

256
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:37,855
I must have lost my mind.

257
00:09:37,856 --> 00:09:39,495
- I thought that you'd pick gomtang. - Why did you pick the burger?

258
00:09:39,496 --> 00:09:40,895
I belong to the gomtang team,

259
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:42,665
- but why did I choose the burger? - Right.

260
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:43,695
You're too impulsive.

261
00:09:43,696 --> 00:09:45,696
It's because of that song.

262
00:09:45,866 --> 00:09:47,505
(That's true.)

263
00:09:47,506 --> 00:09:49,405
As I heard hip-hop music unexpectedly,

264
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:51,575
I couldn't pick gukbap.

265
00:09:51,576 --> 00:09:52,775
If it had been a ballad song,

266
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:54,406
- he'd be eating this. - Goodness.

267
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:56,805
Shall we call the restaurant owner?

268
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:57,846
Excuse me?

269
00:09:57,876 --> 00:09:59,075
- Hello. - Hello.

270
00:09:59,076 --> 00:10:00,415
Are you the head manager?

271
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,145
I'm Manager Lee Mi Ok.

272
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:03,516
- You're a manager? - Yes.

273
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:06,755
The walls are covered with autographs.

274
00:10:06,756 --> 00:10:08,756
Who's the most famous among the customers?

275
00:10:09,386 --> 00:10:11,595
(From famous singers...)

276
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:13,925
(to sports stars)

277
00:10:13,926 --> 00:10:15,526
(And even chefs)

278
00:10:15,626 --> 00:10:16,665
(What will her response be?)

279
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:18,066
Kim Dong Hyun...

280
00:10:18,896 --> 00:10:20,235
Gosh, me?

281
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:21,605
- Did you hit her a moment ago? - What are you saying?

282
00:10:21,606 --> 00:10:22,805
- No, I didn't. - No, right?

283
00:10:22,806 --> 00:10:24,935
I saw that you put Kim Dong Hyun as number one.

284
00:10:24,936 --> 00:10:26,135
You didn't change the order...

285
00:10:26,136 --> 00:10:28,505
- because we were coming, right? - No, definitely not.

286
00:10:28,506 --> 00:10:29,645
We'd like to order.

287
00:10:29,646 --> 00:10:31,015
We'll order for the three of us.

288
00:10:31,016 --> 00:10:32,339
- Please don't be shocked. - Okay.

289
00:10:32,446 --> 00:10:34,646
One assorted gomtang with beef brisket.

290
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,185
Two water parsley gomtang.

291
00:10:36,186 --> 00:10:37,285
One beef tartare bibimbap.

292
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:39,385
One beef tartare, one Neungdong plate of boiled meat.

293
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:41,485
- That will be our order. - All right.

294
00:10:41,486 --> 00:10:43,826
I'll serve you the side dishes first.

295
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,696
This place...

296
00:10:48,026 --> 00:10:50,765
- The beef tartare looks surprising. - The beef tartare...

297
00:10:50,766 --> 00:10:52,796
- I've never seen it like this. - Right?

298
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:53,845
What did I tell you?

299
00:10:55,866 --> 00:10:59,806
(A set meal of water parsley gomtang and beef tartare)

300
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:01,746
First of all... Wait.

301
00:11:01,876 --> 00:11:02,975
- Should we not eat? - Before anything,

302
00:11:02,976 --> 00:11:04,075
- I'll do what you say. - try this first.

303
00:11:04,076 --> 00:11:05,645
Okay, I'll do whatever you say.

304
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:07,916
- I'll show you. - Here you go.

305
00:11:08,216 --> 00:11:10,556
It'd be amazing to eat it in a wrap with sea trumpet.

306
00:11:10,656 --> 00:11:11,815
- And... - He's been talking a lot...

307
00:11:11,816 --> 00:11:12,986
about beef tartare.

308
00:11:13,256 --> 00:11:15,285
It doesn't look overly seasoned.

309
00:11:15,286 --> 00:11:17,195
- It looks simple. - Right.

310
00:11:17,196 --> 00:11:18,196
(The first light dish to start their meal)

311
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,296
Everyone, please follow me.

312
00:11:22,996 --> 00:11:24,135
Two pieces are just enough.

313
00:11:24,136 --> 00:11:25,466
- Two pieces? - Yes.

314
00:11:26,096 --> 00:11:28,105
He's very good at explaining because he has three children.

315
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:29,735
- Please follow me. - Okay.

316
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:31,005
Dad, can I add three?

317
00:11:31,006 --> 00:11:32,276
- You can also add three. - Okay.

318
00:11:33,076 --> 00:11:34,445
- I added them. What's next? - Now,

319
00:11:34,446 --> 00:11:36,105
- grab it with your hand. - Do I make a wrap?

320
00:11:36,106 --> 00:11:38,016
Dad, wait. I'm not done yet.

321
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,375
He's not done yet.

322
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:41,415
(Son, when did your voice change?)

323
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:42,645
- Dad, I'm done. - Did you wrap it?

324
00:11:42,646 --> 00:11:44,216
- I haven't wrapped it yet. - All right.

325
00:11:44,356 --> 00:11:46,185
You should have wrapped with three. That's not enough.

326
00:11:46,186 --> 00:11:47,226
You can use your hand.

327
00:11:48,326 --> 00:11:50,626
(Loose)

328
00:11:50,696 --> 00:11:52,155
- Dad, I can't take it anymore. - Add more.

329
00:11:52,156 --> 00:11:53,225
Do it...

330
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:54,625
with your hand.

331
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:56,395
Add more.

332
00:11:56,396 --> 00:11:57,895
Do it with your hand.

333
00:11:57,896 --> 00:11:59,495
You can use your hand like me.

334
00:11:59,496 --> 00:12:00,906
- You can use your hand. - Dad, I got it.

335
00:12:01,066 --> 00:12:02,535
Let me tell you the most important thing.

336
00:12:02,536 --> 00:12:03,665
(Feeling proud)

337
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,936
You have to dip it in a lot of sesame oil.

338
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:08,505
- You need a lot of it like this. - Dad, that's too much.

339
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:09,745
After getting a lot of sesame oil...

340
00:12:09,746 --> 00:12:11,045
- like this... - Dad.

341
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:12,575
(Eating)

342
00:12:12,576 --> 00:12:13,846
Try it now.

343
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:15,615
That's very patriarchal.

344
00:12:15,616 --> 00:12:19,086
(The eldest son takes the first bite.)

345
00:12:19,986 --> 00:12:21,155
(Eyes widening)

346
00:12:21,156 --> 00:12:23,255
Isn't it amazing?

347
00:12:23,256 --> 00:12:25,025
(Dad, what is this taste?)

348
00:12:25,026 --> 00:12:26,526
Gosh, this is really...

349
00:12:26,596 --> 00:12:27,896
Goodness, what's this?

350
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:36,366
(Seung Ho going through puberty also takes a bite.)

351
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:41,706
What do you think? Isn't it good?

352
00:12:41,746 --> 00:12:44,275
The water parsley scent goes well with sea trumpet and the sauce.

353
00:12:44,276 --> 00:12:45,516
- Inside your mouth... - The sauce is amazing.

354
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:48,445
This isn't just beef tartare.

355
00:12:48,446 --> 00:12:50,816
It tastes like a wrap made by a chef.

356
00:12:51,486 --> 00:12:52,815
- It's a real dish. - Yes.

357
00:12:52,816 --> 00:12:54,056
(A beef tartare wrap with one taste from diverse ingredients)

358
00:12:56,686 --> 00:12:58,656
What shall we try next?

359
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,495
- Can I have some rice? - You may now...

360
00:13:00,496 --> 00:13:01,766
- eat the rice. - We can?

361
00:13:02,426 --> 00:13:04,035
(That's right.)

362
00:13:04,036 --> 00:13:07,736
(We came here to eat gukbap, didn't we?)

363
00:13:08,066 --> 00:13:12,436
(A broth made by cooking beef brisket and shank for a long time)

364
00:13:12,576 --> 00:13:16,476
(A generous amount of juicy brisket is added.)

365
00:13:17,206 --> 00:13:23,716
(It goes through reheating, the essence of making gomtang.)

366
00:13:24,786 --> 00:13:29,226
(Next, fragrant water parsley is chopped.)

367
00:13:29,856 --> 00:13:34,596
(When small pieces of chopped water parsley are added)

368
00:13:35,566 --> 00:13:38,965
(The second dish, water parsley gomtang)

369
00:13:38,966 --> 00:13:40,495
- As I said, - Is that what you said?

370
00:13:40,496 --> 00:13:42,306
the most important is that there isn't just one layer.

371
00:13:42,706 --> 00:13:44,476
There are two layers of water parsley.

372
00:13:44,506 --> 00:13:46,875
There's more underneath.

373
00:13:46,876 --> 00:13:48,306
(Water parsley appears whenever you stir the rice.)

374
00:13:50,406 --> 00:13:52,516
Look, there's water parsley everywhere.

375
00:13:53,346 --> 00:13:54,715
The combination looks incredible.

376
00:13:54,716 --> 00:13:56,946
The water parsley texture overpowers everything.

377
00:13:58,956 --> 00:14:00,085
I scooped up some rice,

378
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:01,655
but there's more water parsley than rice.

379
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:03,656
(As much water parsley as rice)

380
00:14:04,156 --> 00:14:07,826
(Yi Kyung also takes his first bite.)

381
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:14,206
(He devours some broth right away.)

382
00:14:16,066 --> 00:14:18,806
(Seung Ho also takes a bite.)

383
00:14:20,406 --> 00:14:21,546
(Humming)

384
00:14:22,676 --> 00:14:23,876
- Here it is. - What?

385
00:14:24,646 --> 00:14:26,446
When you eat some beef,

386
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:28,385
the beef flavour explodes...

387
00:14:28,386 --> 00:14:29,686
on your palate.

388
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:31,716
As it spreads with the water parsley,

389
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:33,516
the taste is incredible.

390
00:14:34,426 --> 00:14:36,956
(Gulping)

391
00:14:37,086 --> 00:14:39,996
I've been wanting to come here.

392
00:14:41,696 --> 00:14:43,365
This is so annoying.

393
00:14:43,366 --> 00:14:44,396
(This is so annoying.)

394
00:14:44,566 --> 00:14:46,896
(Is that so?)

395
00:14:47,036 --> 00:14:49,806
(Making one beef tartare wrap)

396
00:14:50,436 --> 00:14:52,275
(Taking a bite)

397
00:14:52,276 --> 00:14:55,206
(Taking a bite while looking at Rhymer)

398
00:14:55,746 --> 00:14:57,916
While people were waiting in line...

399
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:00,375
(The second time)

400
00:15:00,376 --> 00:15:01,445
Why are you eating while looking at us?

401
00:15:01,446 --> 00:15:02,688
Why do you keep eating while looking at me?

402
00:15:02,713 --> 00:15:03,743
Even so...

403
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:05,615
(After another sip of the broth)

404
00:15:05,616 --> 00:15:06,616
(The third time)

405
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:09,056
I was wondering if there was someone behind you.

406
00:15:09,786 --> 00:15:11,426
The smell was strong when he talked.

407
00:15:12,556 --> 00:15:14,125
This is really annoying.

408
00:15:14,126 --> 00:15:15,696
(A little annoyed)

409
00:15:15,996 --> 00:15:17,195
- Shall we try this? - This?

410
00:15:17,196 --> 00:15:17,988
Shall we try the plate?

411
00:15:18,296 --> 00:15:19,466
(What's the third dish?)

412
00:15:19,936 --> 00:15:22,936
(The glistening texture of the meat makes their mouths water.)

413
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:28,746
(The third dish, a plate of boiled meat)

414
00:15:29,246 --> 00:15:31,416
(Exclaiming)

415
00:15:35,286 --> 00:15:38,486
(Seung Ho takes a bite after dipping it in the sauce.)

416
00:15:38,886 --> 00:15:42,325
(Humming)

417
00:15:42,326 --> 00:15:43,456
Isn't the meat really nice?

418
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:45,296
It's the best.

419
00:15:46,296 --> 00:15:49,325
It'd be tasty with some seasoned water parsley.

420
00:15:49,326 --> 00:15:50,665
- You mean this? - Yes.

421
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:52,496
- Shall I try that? - Make a wrap with it.

422
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:54,765
Like this?

423
00:15:54,766 --> 00:15:56,005
(Request: Seasoned water parsley and boiled meat)

424
00:15:56,006 --> 00:15:57,576
After dipping it in the sauce?

425
00:15:58,736 --> 00:15:59,976
(The fourth time)

426
00:16:02,476 --> 00:16:03,476
This is delicious.

427
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:04,876
Thank you.

428
00:16:04,877 --> 00:16:06,176
(This is delicious. Thank you.)

429
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:08,115
(Hey, Dong Hyun...)

430
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:09,286
It tastes excellent.

431
00:16:09,646 --> 00:16:11,016
This show is really unusual.

432
00:16:11,416 --> 00:16:12,915
In front of the guest...

433
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,755
(Eating annoyingly)

434
00:16:14,756 --> 00:16:16,585
I mean,

435
00:16:16,586 --> 00:16:19,595
who eats while teasing the members on the show?

436
00:16:19,596 --> 00:16:20,696
Goodness.

437
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,425
Isn't this a total violation of human rights?

438
00:16:23,426 --> 00:16:25,436
(Isn't this a total violation of human rights?)

439
00:16:27,096 --> 00:16:29,605
To taste the meat here...

440
00:16:29,606 --> 00:16:30,875
Shall I mix it for you?

441
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:32,675
- Do you want to mix it? - I'll do it for you.

442
00:16:32,676 --> 00:16:34,775
(You must do everything to freeload.)

443
00:16:34,776 --> 00:16:36,546
Sang Uk, can you mix it with chopsticks?

444
00:16:36,876 --> 00:16:37,876
With chopsticks?

445
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:40,075
(Oh, okay...)

446
00:16:40,076 --> 00:16:41,846
You have to mix it with chopsticks.

447
00:16:42,716 --> 00:16:44,156
Try the beef tartare separately.

448
00:16:44,756 --> 00:16:46,755
Look how nice the meat is.

449
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:48,286
(Sniffing)

450
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:50,255
Hurry and try it.

451
00:16:50,256 --> 00:16:51,326
No.

452
00:16:52,396 --> 00:16:53,796
- What's going on? - Nothing.

453
00:16:54,796 --> 00:16:56,626
- Nothing. - Nothing.

454
00:16:56,926 --> 00:16:59,995
(Meanwhile, Sang Uk obtained...)

455
00:16:59,996 --> 00:17:01,765
(a stem of water parsley that he dropped.)

456
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:03,136
- It's delicious. - But...

457
00:17:03,266 --> 00:17:04,506
I was just...

458
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,835
- The spoon. - I was just smelling the spoon.

459
00:17:06,836 --> 00:17:08,345
(You'd better not eat it.)

460
00:17:08,346 --> 00:17:09,346
You're eliminated.

461
00:17:09,347 --> 00:17:11,315
- It's just the spoon. - But...

462
00:17:11,316 --> 00:17:12,476
(Gently)

463
00:17:14,346 --> 00:17:19,316
(A gentle touch)

464
00:17:19,786 --> 00:17:21,455
- Wait, what have you done? - I haven't touched the food.

465
00:17:21,456 --> 00:17:23,325
(In reality, he's the reserved type.)

466
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:24,825
I haven't touched the food.

467
00:17:24,826 --> 00:17:26,796
I only felt it lightly.

468
00:17:26,896 --> 00:17:28,025
You can't do that.

469
00:17:28,026 --> 00:17:29,225
(He's very strict with the food.)

470
00:17:29,226 --> 00:17:30,366
Goodness.

471
00:17:31,936 --> 00:17:34,405
- We must do something to freeload. - Exactly.

472
00:17:34,406 --> 00:17:36,866
- Could you do something? - Hurry up.

473
00:17:36,906 --> 00:17:39,405
- Shall we start something? - Yes.

474
00:17:39,406 --> 00:17:40,476
Yes.

475
00:17:40,946 --> 00:17:43,606
Do you know Fish, Tree, Bird, Animal Game?

476
00:17:44,006 --> 00:17:45,475
- "Fish, Tree, Bird, Animal Game?" - Isn't it about...

477
00:17:45,476 --> 00:17:47,846
- naming fish and trees? - Yes.

478
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,185
(A game where you name...)

479
00:17:49,186 --> 00:17:50,445
(fish, trees, birds, and animals in order)

480
00:17:50,446 --> 00:17:51,655
It'll take long to explain.

481
00:17:51,656 --> 00:17:52,785
Shall we play later?

482
00:17:52,786 --> 00:17:54,226
I have to eat now.

483
00:17:55,426 --> 00:17:57,155
(Here they go again.)

484
00:17:57,156 --> 00:17:58,256
Let's play this later.

485
00:17:58,626 --> 00:18:01,295
Are you telling us to play...

486
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:03,625
a game or not?

487
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:05,565
What are you doing?

488
00:18:05,566 --> 00:18:07,605
What on earth are you doing?

489
00:18:07,606 --> 00:18:09,536
You invited me all the way out here.

490
00:18:10,066 --> 00:18:12,076
Two of them are teasing us while eating.

491
00:18:12,336 --> 00:18:14,446
One of them is making a joke about playing games.

492
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:16,005
Let's play something simple.

493
00:18:16,006 --> 00:18:18,645
Rhymer, you played memorize your times tables last time.

494
00:18:18,646 --> 00:18:20,045
(He failed the game of memorizing time tables.)

495
00:18:20,046 --> 00:18:21,316
Right.

496
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:23,185
Instead of time tables,

497
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,285
- memorize your addition. - Right.

498
00:18:24,286 --> 00:18:25,316
Addition?

499
00:18:26,216 --> 00:18:27,786
It's time to redeem yourself.

500
00:18:28,456 --> 00:18:29,625
There will be one loser who can't eat.

501
00:18:29,626 --> 00:18:31,156
Two winners can eat a bite of whatever you want.

502
00:18:31,826 --> 00:18:33,325
- Only one loser can't eat? - Exactly.

503
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:34,895
- Just 1 person? - It's over when 1 person is out.

504
00:18:34,896 --> 00:18:35,896
It's over.

505
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:37,066
(The winning rate is 66 percent.)

506
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:38,135
We can play in this order...

507
00:18:38,136 --> 00:18:39,136
starting with Sang Uk.

508
00:18:39,137 --> 00:18:40,336
I need to ask the most difficult one.

509
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:44,275
(Add the numbers)

510
00:18:44,276 --> 00:18:45,976
- Six plus two? - Eight.

511
00:18:46,836 --> 00:18:48,745
(His plan failed.)

512
00:18:48,746 --> 00:18:50,575
- Eight plus six? - Fourteen.

513
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:52,815
Add the numbers

514
00:18:52,816 --> 00:18:54,145
- Six plus two? - Eight.

515
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:56,215
- Add the numbers - Add the numbers

516
00:18:56,216 --> 00:18:57,345
Three plus six?

517
00:18:57,346 --> 00:18:58,456
- Soup... - Wait a minute.

518
00:18:59,756 --> 00:19:01,825
(3 plus 6 equals soup...)

519
00:19:01,826 --> 00:19:04,255
No, 3 plus 6 is 9.

520
00:19:04,256 --> 00:19:05,526
Is it nine or soup?

521
00:19:06,056 --> 00:19:07,096
Answer precisely.

522
00:19:07,196 --> 00:19:09,125
Nine. Three plus six is nine.

523
00:19:09,126 --> 00:19:10,395
(Brushing it off)

524
00:19:10,396 --> 00:19:12,835
(Shameless)

525
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:15,136
- It's your turn. - I said 3 plus 6...

526
00:19:15,536 --> 00:19:19,106
(You didn't ask.)

527
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:20,876
What are you doing?

528
00:19:21,225 --> 00:19:22,225
Then you're out.

529
00:19:22,646 --> 00:19:23,805
You're eliminated.

530
00:19:23,806 --> 00:19:25,215
You tried to brush it off, but you're out.

531
00:19:25,216 --> 00:19:26,216
This can't be helped.

532
00:19:26,217 --> 00:19:27,576
Then Rhymer can't try any?

533
00:19:29,446 --> 00:19:30,446
It's not my problem.

534
00:19:30,447 --> 00:19:31,515
(Rhymer is excluded from freeloading.)

535
00:19:31,516 --> 00:19:32,616
For now...

536
00:19:32,856 --> 00:19:34,785
Gosh, what should I try?

537
00:19:34,786 --> 00:19:36,955
- I recommend you the wrap. - Isn't that the best?

538
00:19:36,956 --> 00:19:39,026
- Sang Uk, take a spoonful of this. - Eat it with the radish.

539
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:42,325
He's making a wrap...

540
00:19:42,326 --> 00:19:43,893
- for his one bite. - It's for the combination.

541
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,665
(Tae Hyun is making a wrap based on what he saw.)

542
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:50,165
Try it with a lot of this sauce.

543
00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,406
Dip it in a lot of sauce.

544
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:54,606
I've never had this before.

545
00:19:55,676 --> 00:19:58,345
(A lot)

546
00:19:58,346 --> 00:19:59,346
You'll be very surprised.

547
00:19:59,347 --> 00:20:01,246
(A bite with a lot of sauce)

548
00:20:03,586 --> 00:20:04,655
The garlic scent...

549
00:20:04,656 --> 00:20:05,715
- Right? - Right.

550
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:07,516
(The garlic scent tickles the tip of his nose.)

551
00:20:08,686 --> 00:20:10,455
Really? Are you serious?

552
00:20:10,456 --> 00:20:12,326
- It tastes amazing. - Really?

553
00:20:13,926 --> 00:20:16,966
Can I just taste the water parsley?

554
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:21,036
(His water parsley is seized.)

555
00:20:21,866 --> 00:20:24,165
If you taste water parsley here, you tried everything.

556
00:20:24,166 --> 00:20:25,206
Is that so?

557
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:28,946
(What's this?)

558
00:20:29,276 --> 00:20:31,945
Sang Uk scooped up some bibimbap for himself.

559
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:32,946
It's exact.

560
00:20:32,947 --> 00:20:36,115
(Sang Uk's perfect bite of beef tartare bibimbap)

561
00:20:36,116 --> 00:20:38,856
Actually, I haven't tried the beef tartare bibimbap yet.

562
00:20:39,256 --> 00:20:40,786
(And?)

563
00:20:40,986 --> 00:20:43,026
I'll try what Sang Uk prepared.

564
00:20:45,256 --> 00:20:46,495
I made the combination...

565
00:20:46,496 --> 00:20:48,125
with the 3-3-4 ratio.

566
00:20:48,126 --> 00:20:49,866
- Exactly. - That looks amazing.

567
00:20:50,096 --> 00:20:51,795
He made a nice spoonful of it.

568
00:20:51,796 --> 00:20:53,295
(Beef tartare 3, water parsley 4, rice 4)

569
00:20:53,296 --> 00:20:54,436
Eat it from the top.

570
00:20:57,206 --> 00:21:00,106
(His cheeks are about to burst.)

571
00:21:01,706 --> 00:21:05,045
(That was mine.)

572
00:21:05,046 --> 00:21:06,216
Give it back to me.

573
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:08,545
- I need to make it again. - Isn't it amazing?

574
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:11,085
At first, it tastes bland.

575
00:21:11,086 --> 00:21:14,115
The more you eat, the more savoury it gets. So it's addicting.

576
00:21:14,116 --> 00:21:15,855
It sets the standard for beef tartare bibimbap.

577
00:21:15,856 --> 00:21:16,886
I love it.

578
00:21:17,086 --> 00:21:18,626
- Thank you for the food. - Enjoy.

579
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:22,766
(Eating)

580
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:27,035
Watching you eat makes us happy.

581
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,535
(He makes his viewers' mouths water.)

582
00:21:28,536 --> 00:21:29,606
Seriously.

583
00:21:29,966 --> 00:21:32,605
- Is it seasoned with soy sauce? - Right?

584
00:21:32,606 --> 00:21:33,776
- It's made with soy sauce. - I think so.

585
00:21:34,706 --> 00:21:36,745
- It's very savoury. - I don't want people to understand.

586
00:21:36,746 --> 00:21:38,745
It doesn't taste just bland.

587
00:21:38,746 --> 00:21:41,015
- Your palate gets attacked... - The savoury taste.

588
00:21:41,016 --> 00:21:42,416
by the savoury flavour everywhere.

589
00:21:43,046 --> 00:21:45,115
It's possible only when the ingredients are very fresh.

590
00:21:45,116 --> 00:21:46,915
(Fresh beef tartare added to the savoury flavour of soy sauce)

591
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:49,285
Gomtang isn't the only famous dish at this restaurant.

592
00:21:49,286 --> 00:21:50,986
The beef tartare bibimbap is...

593
00:21:51,356 --> 00:21:53,026
a key part of the menu.

594
00:21:53,096 --> 00:21:55,666
Rhymer, you may not be paying this time,

595
00:21:55,896 --> 00:21:58,036
but you can't eat either.

596
00:21:58,466 --> 00:22:00,335
You may not be paying this time, but you can't eat either.

597
00:22:00,336 --> 00:22:01,365
(Hitting the nail on his head)

598
00:22:01,366 --> 00:22:03,666
You aren't paying, but you can't eat either.

599
00:22:03,736 --> 00:22:05,475
Something is always missing.

600
00:22:05,476 --> 00:22:07,205
- He might be paying. - Right.

601
00:22:07,206 --> 00:22:08,675
"He might be paying?"

602
00:22:08,676 --> 00:22:10,105
("It's not the end until it ends" by Oh Sang Uk)

603
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:12,176
That would be ridiculous.

604
00:22:12,546 --> 00:22:14,715
Instead of playing Fish, Tree, Bird, Animal Game,

605
00:22:14,716 --> 00:22:17,346
why don't you play something simpler?

606
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:20,215
One additional rule is added to the original rules of 3, 6, 9.

607
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:22,125
Shout "hooray" when it's a multiple of five.

608
00:22:22,126 --> 00:22:23,286
(Shout "hooray" when it's a multiple of 5.)

609
00:22:23,486 --> 00:22:25,996
Clap at 3, 6, and 9, and say hooray at 5 or 10?

610
00:22:26,096 --> 00:22:27,456
- Exactly. - Fifteen, twenty.

611
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:28,525
You must say "hooray."

612
00:22:28,526 --> 00:22:29,765
- Are there 2 winners? - There's only 1.

613
00:22:29,766 --> 00:22:31,435
- There's only 1 winner. - Only 1?

614
00:22:31,436 --> 00:22:33,066
I guarantee you that you'll lose before ten.

615
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,106
- I think so too. - You'll lose before ten.

616
00:22:37,206 --> 00:22:38,206
Let's do it.

617
00:22:38,207 --> 00:22:39,676
(How will it turn out this time?)

618
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:41,176
- You start. - Me?

619
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:43,645
- Three, six, nine - Three, six, nine

620
00:22:43,646 --> 00:22:44,915
- One. - Two.

621
00:22:44,916 --> 00:22:46,046
- Four. - Five.

622
00:22:46,076 --> 00:22:47,986
- Goodness. - Wait.

623
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:50,815
- Wait a minute. - Mi Ok saved you.

624
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:52,155
She saved you.

625
00:22:52,156 --> 00:22:54,525
- It's because... - Because of that?

626
00:22:54,526 --> 00:22:55,885
- That's why... - Five.

627
00:22:55,886 --> 00:22:58,956
- She surprised me as she passed by. - Right.

628
00:22:59,226 --> 00:23:00,925
- I'm serious. - Come on.

629
00:23:00,926 --> 00:23:03,865
She passed by in front of the cameras during the shoot.

630
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:05,466
- She passed by so suddenly. - Okay.

631
00:23:05,496 --> 00:23:07,165
Let's change the order. I'll go first.

632
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,465
We'll play in this order.

633
00:23:08,466 --> 00:23:10,735
- Three, six, nine - Three, six, nine

634
00:23:10,736 --> 00:23:11,935
- One. - Two.

635
00:23:11,936 --> 00:23:12,936
Four.

636
00:23:13,076 --> 00:23:14,176
Hooray.

637
00:23:15,506 --> 00:23:17,406
- Seven. - Eight.

638
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,046
Ten.

639
00:23:20,716 --> 00:23:21,945
(Tae Hyun is eliminated.)

640
00:23:21,946 --> 00:23:23,046
I didn't know.

641
00:23:23,116 --> 00:23:25,455
(He's one step closer to taking a bite.)

642
00:23:25,456 --> 00:23:26,656
This is difficult.

643
00:23:26,816 --> 00:23:28,455
- Would you like to go first? - Okay.

644
00:23:28,456 --> 00:23:30,655
- Three, six, nine - Three, six, nine

645
00:23:30,656 --> 00:23:31,826
- One. - Two.

646
00:23:32,296 --> 00:23:33,726
- Four. - Hooray.

647
00:23:34,896 --> 00:23:36,696
- Seven. - Eight.

648
00:23:38,896 --> 00:23:39,936
Hooray.

649
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:42,236
What was that?

650
00:23:42,636 --> 00:23:44,575
- I meant hooray. - That was close.

651
00:23:44,576 --> 00:23:45,975
That was close. You have to play fast.

652
00:23:45,976 --> 00:23:47,484
- Eleven. - Twelve.

653
00:23:48,106 --> 00:23:49,945
- Fourteen. - Hooray.

654
00:23:49,946 --> 00:23:51,006
Sixteen...

655
00:23:53,116 --> 00:23:56,246
(He finally made it!)

656
00:23:56,346 --> 00:23:59,486
Sang Uk is a nice guy.

657
00:23:59,556 --> 00:24:01,685
- I noticed his intention. - That's not true.

658
00:24:01,686 --> 00:24:03,526
- No. - He wasn't being nice at all.

659
00:24:04,956 --> 00:24:07,125
(Taking a big spoonful of the beef tartare bibimbap)

660
00:24:07,126 --> 00:24:08,166
After this...

661
00:24:09,226 --> 00:24:10,295
It keeps falling off.

662
00:24:10,296 --> 00:24:12,765
I'll put this on top.

663
00:24:12,766 --> 00:24:13,766
With a lot of sauce.

664
00:24:17,936 --> 00:24:20,635
(Big enough to explode)

665
00:24:20,636 --> 00:24:22,345
(Eating)

666
00:24:22,346 --> 00:24:23,775
I haven't tried the boiled meat.

667
00:24:23,776 --> 00:24:25,015
I should've eaten it like that.

668
00:24:25,016 --> 00:24:26,016
(I'm jealous.)

669
00:24:26,446 --> 00:24:28,945
(Rhymer also got to freeload.)

670
00:24:28,946 --> 00:24:31,145
- It's nice. - We ordered this much food,

671
00:24:31,146 --> 00:24:32,316
but the total is only 155 dollars.

672
00:24:33,386 --> 00:24:36,485
With the bill at a popular gomtang restaurant in Seongsu-dong...

673
00:24:36,486 --> 00:24:38,426
- on the line, let's take the quiz. - Okay.

674
00:24:38,796 --> 00:24:40,726
Let's answer correctly and give them the bill.

675
00:24:41,196 --> 00:24:43,826
Don't worry. They'll pay.

676
00:24:45,536 --> 00:24:48,235
(Each of them puts his card for payment.)

677
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:49,506
You and I have the same card.

678
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:52,136
What type of card do you have?

679
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:56,275
Hey, you can't pay anything with that.

680
00:24:56,276 --> 00:24:58,145
(A rather unconventional credit card)

681
00:24:58,146 --> 00:24:59,576
You can't put down your ID card.

682
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:04,146
(I guess we can't buy on credit here.)

683
00:25:04,583 --> 00:25:06,823
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

684
00:25:06,983 --> 00:25:09,552
In Korean, there's a common phrase,

685
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:11,623
"Five minutes before chaos."

686
00:25:11,993 --> 00:25:12,993
Right.

687
00:25:13,063 --> 00:25:14,462
"Chaos" in this phrase...

688
00:25:14,463 --> 00:25:18,103
refers to a situation where this opens.

689
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:21,101
This is something you can find in this restaurant.

690
00:25:21,363 --> 00:25:22,703
What is this?

691
00:25:24,033 --> 00:25:26,502
Listen. We say, "Five minutes before chaos."

692
00:25:26,503 --> 00:25:30,013
When this opens, everything must break loose.

693
00:25:30,343 --> 00:25:33,543
There's a huge mess when something opens.

694
00:25:33,583 --> 00:25:34,753
On the other hand,

695
00:25:34,883 --> 00:25:37,982
"five minutes before" seems to signify something.

696
00:25:37,983 --> 00:25:39,552
It sounds like five minutes...

697
00:25:39,553 --> 00:25:41,383
before opening of a successful restaurant.

698
00:25:41,853 --> 00:25:43,023
That sounds good.

699
00:25:43,123 --> 00:25:44,523
We can also approach it that way.

700
00:25:45,363 --> 00:25:46,922
Five minutes before the restaurant opens?

701
00:25:46,923 --> 00:25:48,093
Five minutes before chaos.

702
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,802
I also thought about a cast iron pot.

703
00:25:51,803 --> 00:25:52,863
That sounds reasonable too.

704
00:25:54,003 --> 00:25:56,733
They won't get this one. It's too difficult.

705
00:25:56,933 --> 00:25:59,742
I feel like I won't get to pay this time.

706
00:25:59,743 --> 00:26:00,943
- I don't think that we'll pay. - Right.

707
00:26:01,713 --> 00:26:03,112
I suddenly thought of a rice cooker...

708
00:26:03,113 --> 00:26:04,743
after you brought up the cast iron pot.

709
00:26:05,113 --> 00:26:06,582
Will it be opening of the door...

710
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:10,082
or opening of the rice cooker? Let's pick 1 between the 2.

711
00:26:10,083 --> 00:26:11,083
Listen, Dong Hyun.

712
00:26:11,084 --> 00:26:15,692
If it was a door, he wouldn't have specified this restaurant.

713
00:26:15,693 --> 00:26:18,162
When my grandmother made gomtang for me...

714
00:26:18,163 --> 00:26:20,292
She made gomtang for me every day,

715
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:21,463
and she always made it in a cast iron pot.

716
00:26:21,763 --> 00:26:23,393
It was because she lived in the countryside.

717
00:26:24,363 --> 00:26:26,602
- By the entrance, - Right.

718
00:26:26,603 --> 00:26:30,072
I might have seen a cast iron pot behind the glass door.

719
00:26:30,073 --> 00:26:31,103
The steam was...

720
00:26:31,273 --> 00:26:33,802
I'm sorry, but could you hurry up?

721
00:26:33,803 --> 00:26:36,313
- We need to go and eat hamburgers. - I'm starving.

722
00:26:36,543 --> 00:26:37,772
You just need to decide.

723
00:26:37,773 --> 00:26:39,943
- I'm fixed on the cast iron pot. - What do you think, Yi Kyung?

724
00:26:41,243 --> 00:26:43,282
- I'll go with the cast iron pot. - Are you leaning towards that?

725
00:26:43,283 --> 00:26:44,552
- Or the lid? - The lid?

726
00:26:44,553 --> 00:26:46,723
Our answer is cast iron pot lid.

727
00:26:48,293 --> 00:26:49,322
Cast iron pot lid?

728
00:26:49,323 --> 00:26:54,362
(Answer: Cast iron pot lid)

729
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,333
Cast iron pot lid is correct.

730
00:26:57,363 --> 00:26:59,833
I was right.

731
00:27:00,063 --> 00:27:01,063
That's correct.

732
00:27:01,064 --> 00:27:04,473
(How did they get it right?)

733
00:27:05,103 --> 00:27:07,543
I knew it. Seung Ho is really good.

734
00:27:07,973 --> 00:27:10,113
- Wasn't I right? - Is that the exact answer?

735
00:27:10,613 --> 00:27:13,542
During the Korean War on the day of food distribution,

736
00:27:13,543 --> 00:27:16,412
people scrambled around the cast iron pot...

737
00:27:16,413 --> 00:27:18,352
where rice was being cooked.

738
00:27:18,353 --> 00:27:20,152
It refers to the chaos right before the lid opened.

739
00:27:20,153 --> 00:27:21,922
- We explained everything. - We did.

740
00:27:21,923 --> 00:27:24,523
Cooking and the cast iron pot.

741
00:27:25,163 --> 00:27:27,362
The cast iron pot lid was accurate.

742
00:27:27,363 --> 00:27:31,033
All right, could three of you put down your credit cards?

743
00:27:31,493 --> 00:27:32,862
How did they get it right?

744
00:27:32,863 --> 00:27:35,002
- What did I tell you, Rhymer? - Goodness.

745
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:37,572
It always turns out like this when you're here.

746
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,042
The vibe is...

747
00:27:39,043 --> 00:27:40,642
This can't be helped.

748
00:27:40,643 --> 00:27:43,342
Weren't you informed about the cast iron pot lid?

749
00:27:43,343 --> 00:27:44,612
- No way. - In order...

750
00:27:44,613 --> 00:27:46,913
to avoid being suspected...

751
00:27:47,343 --> 00:27:48,682
(Team Hamburger puts down their card for payment.)

752
00:27:48,683 --> 00:27:49,712
Rhymer.

753
00:27:49,713 --> 00:27:51,453
This is what happens.

754
00:27:51,723 --> 00:27:53,482
As you know, this will be an individual game.

755
00:27:53,483 --> 00:27:54,483
Okay.

756
00:27:55,123 --> 00:27:57,322
- Here's a famous quote quiz. - Famous quote?

757
00:27:57,323 --> 00:28:00,392
Please guess the word that goes in the blank.

758
00:28:00,393 --> 00:28:02,133
- This should be short. - Let's find out.

759
00:28:02,593 --> 00:28:04,263
A quote by Eleanor Roosevelt.

760
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:06,532
Roosevelt?

761
00:28:06,533 --> 00:28:08,733
She was the wife of President Roosevelt.

762
00:28:08,803 --> 00:28:12,103
"To handle yourself, use your A."

763
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,243
"To handle others, use your B.”

764
00:28:16,373 --> 00:28:17,873
Each of you has a chance at first.

765
00:28:18,143 --> 00:28:20,012
You have to guess one of them right.

766
00:28:20,013 --> 00:28:21,013
I got it.

767
00:28:21,383 --> 00:28:22,552
Which one, A or B?

768
00:28:22,553 --> 00:28:23,613
- A. - A.

769
00:28:24,053 --> 00:28:25,822
- To handle yourself... - Punishment.

770
00:28:25,823 --> 00:28:26,952
(To handle yourself, use punishment.")

771
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:28,352
Handle yourself with punishment?

772
00:28:28,353 --> 00:28:29,723
- Incorrect. - That was good.

773
00:28:30,723 --> 00:28:33,193
- He's an athlete indeed. - Did Seung Ho say that?

774
00:28:33,263 --> 00:28:34,723
I got it. B is love.

775
00:28:35,233 --> 00:28:36,463
- B, love? - Handle others with love.

776
00:28:36,793 --> 00:28:37,793
Incorrect.

777
00:28:37,863 --> 00:28:39,263
I got it.

778
00:28:39,463 --> 00:28:41,262
To handle yourself, use books.

779
00:28:41,263 --> 00:28:42,402
That sounds reasonable.

780
00:28:42,403 --> 00:28:44,103
Books? Incorrect.

781
00:28:44,703 --> 00:28:46,372
- You can say whatever from now on. - It's about speed from now on.

782
00:28:46,373 --> 00:28:47,402
Say whatever is on your mind.

783
00:28:47,403 --> 00:28:49,013
- A, meditation. - Incorrect.

784
00:28:49,243 --> 00:28:51,113
A, your head.

785
00:28:51,643 --> 00:28:52,643
"A, your head?"

786
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:53,712
(To handle yourself, use your head.)

787
00:28:53,713 --> 00:28:54,713
Correct.

788
00:28:55,113 --> 00:28:56,612
Say B right away.

789
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:57,912
(Sang Uk is the first to pass.)

790
00:28:57,913 --> 00:28:58,922
Correct.

791
00:28:58,923 --> 00:29:01,023
(Did he answer correctly already?)

792
00:29:01,583 --> 00:29:02,922
Use your head to handle yourself.

793
00:29:02,923 --> 00:29:05,623
- To handle others... - Use your mind.

794
00:29:06,063 --> 00:29:07,523
- It wasn't correct. - Mind? Incorrect.

795
00:29:07,963 --> 00:29:09,792
Search somewhere in the body.

796
00:29:09,793 --> 00:29:11,492
- Tae Hyun. - B, your heart.

797
00:29:11,493 --> 00:29:12,532
Your heart?

798
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:13,803
(That can't be right.)

799
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:15,173
Correct.

800
00:29:15,673 --> 00:29:17,772
(Tae Hyun also passes.)

801
00:29:17,773 --> 00:29:18,843
Correct.

802
00:29:19,003 --> 00:29:22,612
(Rhymer has to pay the bill.)

803
00:29:22,613 --> 00:29:24,572
He has to pay again.

804
00:29:24,573 --> 00:29:26,143
No, wait a minute.

805
00:29:26,613 --> 00:29:28,853
- Hold on a second. - This is deja vu.

806
00:29:28,953 --> 00:29:29,953
By the way...

807
00:29:30,353 --> 00:29:31,852
I've seen this on TV.

808
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,383
Rhymer didn't get to eat much.

809
00:29:33,553 --> 00:29:35,193
After inviting your junior,

810
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:37,053
is this how you treat me?

811
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:38,992
A moment ago, Tae Hyun said...

812
00:29:38,993 --> 00:29:40,222
He did his best.

813
00:29:40,223 --> 00:29:42,293
Please handle me with your heart!

814
00:29:43,393 --> 00:29:45,433
Why aren't you handling me with your heart?

815
00:29:45,903 --> 00:29:48,703
Please handle me first with your heart.

816
00:29:50,273 --> 00:29:52,342
(This is so fun to watch.)

817
00:29:52,343 --> 00:29:53,443
- Today, - Yes?

818
00:29:53,773 --> 00:29:56,142
I was happy to see you...

819
00:29:56,143 --> 00:29:57,442
- Look at that. - enjoy your food.

820
00:29:57,443 --> 00:29:58,482
(I was still happy.)

821
00:29:58,483 --> 00:30:01,643
I'm handling you with my heart.

822
00:30:02,113 --> 00:30:03,113
Seriously.

823
00:30:03,114 --> 00:30:04,252
- You're right. - I'm not kidding.

824
00:30:04,253 --> 00:30:06,022
There's something I want to verify.

825
00:30:06,023 --> 00:30:08,253
I want to know if there is a cast iron pot lid at this restaurant.

826
00:30:08,523 --> 00:30:10,353
I'll take a look on my way out.

827
00:30:11,253 --> 00:30:12,592
I must verify with my own eyes...

828
00:30:12,593 --> 00:30:13,922
before paying.

829
00:30:13,923 --> 00:30:15,262
This is the kitchen.

830
00:30:15,263 --> 00:30:16,332
(On his way to see the cast iron pot)

831
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:17,333
Is there one?

832
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,002
You didn't put this cast iron pot a moment ago, did you?

833
00:30:21,003 --> 00:30:22,632
- No. - Was it already here?

834
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:26,173
(They're here 365 days a year.)

835
00:30:27,043 --> 00:30:29,312
- There are two pots. - They're always here.

836
00:30:29,313 --> 00:30:30,642
(Rhymer is paying for the fifth time.)

837
00:30:30,643 --> 00:30:32,383
There's a cast iron pot lid as big as this.

838
00:30:32,483 --> 00:30:34,612
- Isn't there? - They have two big ones.

839
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:35,783
I'll go and take a look.

840
00:30:36,613 --> 00:30:38,452
(Total: 155 dollars)

841
00:30:38,453 --> 00:30:40,983
(LMR 1 ends with the cast iron pot lid.)

842
00:30:42,093 --> 00:30:43,653
That was a great meal.

843
00:30:44,453 --> 00:30:45,623
I'm exhausted now.

844
00:30:45,663 --> 00:30:48,022
You've been starving for too long.

845
00:30:48,023 --> 00:30:49,093
I'm so hungry.

846
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:50,693
This looks delicious.

847
00:30:51,193 --> 00:30:53,203
There are so many places with nice vibes.

848
00:30:53,463 --> 00:30:57,833
This has a different vibe from the crowded area.

849
00:30:58,403 --> 00:30:59,973
There are many dessert shops.

850
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:02,273
It'd be nice to live here.

851
00:31:02,373 --> 00:31:04,742
I guess you're able to enjoy the view.

852
00:31:04,743 --> 00:31:05,813
(I'm too hungry to enjoy it.)

853
00:31:06,083 --> 00:31:07,008
I'm full.

854
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:08,403
Hey, is this the place?

855
00:31:08,483 --> 00:31:09,612
There's something up there.

856
00:31:09,613 --> 00:31:11,012
This is it. I've been here.

857
00:31:11,013 --> 00:31:12,883
- This restaurant is good. - It looks very...

858
00:31:12,923 --> 00:31:14,782
- Is this it? - For a hamburger place,

859
00:31:14,783 --> 00:31:16,223
- It looks like a coffee shop. - isn't it too fancy?

860
00:31:16,923 --> 00:31:18,352
- Welcome. - Hello.

861
00:31:18,353 --> 00:31:19,523
It looks so pretty inside.

862
00:31:20,063 --> 00:31:23,263
(Inside, it looks like a hip burger restaurant in the US.)

863
00:31:24,093 --> 00:31:25,232
It's really pretty.

864
00:31:25,233 --> 00:31:26,732
(Retro items...)

865
00:31:26,733 --> 00:31:29,273
(and a stylish interior)

866
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:34,243
(Juicy and thick patties)

867
00:31:35,343 --> 00:31:38,273
(Even plump and succulent shrimp patties)

868
00:31:39,783 --> 00:31:43,583
(LMR 2, handmade burger)

869
00:31:43,953 --> 00:31:44,953
It's so nice inside.

870
00:31:44,954 --> 00:31:45,983
(As soon as they enter the restaurant,)

871
00:31:46,253 --> 00:31:49,253
(he checks the menu.)

872
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:51,152
- Here's what I noticed. - It's nice.

873
00:31:51,153 --> 00:31:53,693
There's another red brick house on the other side.

874
00:31:53,923 --> 00:31:55,563
This place looks great.

875
00:31:55,763 --> 00:31:59,203
During the renovation, they dug out land to make a yard.

876
00:31:59,433 --> 00:32:01,502
They made an area where we can rest.

877
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:03,133
- Shall we order? - They made it on purpose.

878
00:32:03,573 --> 00:32:05,402
Oh, right.

879
00:32:05,403 --> 00:32:06,642
Hurry up and order.

880
00:32:06,643 --> 00:32:08,003
You've been starving for too long.

881
00:32:08,473 --> 00:32:09,912
Order whatever you want.

882
00:32:09,913 --> 00:32:11,172
- I don't mind. - I want wasabi shrimp.

883
00:32:11,173 --> 00:32:12,613
- Right. - Pick what you want.

884
00:32:12,743 --> 00:32:14,142
- Hello. - Hello.

885
00:32:14,143 --> 00:32:15,253
Thank you.

886
00:32:15,753 --> 00:32:18,753
We'd like two...

887
00:32:19,323 --> 00:32:20,782
- wasabi shrimp burgers. - Okay.

888
00:32:20,783 --> 00:32:22,292
I've never seen him unable to order food.

889
00:32:22,293 --> 00:32:24,522
One beef 2X cheeseburger.

890
00:32:24,523 --> 00:32:25,822
"Beef 2X cheeseburger?"

891
00:32:25,823 --> 00:32:26,893
We'd like one of these.

892
00:32:26,993 --> 00:32:28,892
- And a casserole. - Okay.

893
00:32:28,893 --> 00:32:30,063
We'll order one of these.

894
00:32:30,263 --> 00:32:31,902
- I'd like to make a recommendation. - Yes?

895
00:32:31,903 --> 00:32:33,532
You ordered a beef 2X cheeseburger.

896
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:36,032
How about ordering double patties for that burger?

897
00:32:36,033 --> 00:32:37,532
- Double sounds good. - Double patties.

898
00:32:37,533 --> 00:32:38,602
That sounds great.

899
00:32:38,603 --> 00:32:39,603
- Seriously. - I'll get it ready.

900
00:32:39,604 --> 00:32:41,542
Thank you.

901
00:32:41,543 --> 00:32:43,312
(2 wasabi shrimp burgers, 2 2X double cheeseburgers...)

902
00:32:43,313 --> 00:32:44,513
Goodness.

903
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:47,442
I should come here with my two daughters.

904
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:49,083
(Tae Hyun wants to bring his daughters here next time.)

905
00:32:49,213 --> 00:32:50,838
My daughters would love it.

906
00:32:51,113 --> 00:32:52,723
(A perfect date with their dad)

907
00:32:53,553 --> 00:32:54,553
It's here.

908
00:32:54,554 --> 00:32:56,253
- We'll go. - I'll go.

909
00:32:56,623 --> 00:32:57,692
We'll do it.

910
00:32:57,693 --> 00:32:59,092
Please trust us.

911
00:32:59,093 --> 00:33:00,592
- You can trust us. - In that case...

912
00:33:00,593 --> 00:33:02,832
Then go with Sang Uk.

913
00:33:02,833 --> 00:33:04,132
- Okay. - Of course.

914
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:06,363
- All right. - You can trust us.

915
00:33:06,503 --> 00:33:07,503
Sang Uk.

916
00:33:07,504 --> 00:33:08,932
- All right? - Okay.

917
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:10,732
I'll keep my eye on them.

918
00:33:10,733 --> 00:33:11,973
A moment ago...

919
00:33:12,273 --> 00:33:13,773
I'll verify your order.

920
00:33:14,173 --> 00:33:15,673
- We put a sticker... - Goodness.

921
00:33:15,973 --> 00:33:17,272
on the burger with a lot of wasabi.

922
00:33:17,273 --> 00:33:18,842
(Eating without hesitating)

923
00:33:18,843 --> 00:33:19,882
And...

924
00:33:19,883 --> 00:33:22,282
We put a sticker on the burger with a lot of wasabi.

925
00:33:22,283 --> 00:33:23,612
Do it like this.

926
00:33:23,613 --> 00:33:24,812
(Naturally tasting while listening to the explanation)

927
00:33:24,813 --> 00:33:26,183
- It's at the bottom. - Eat the middle.

928
00:33:26,353 --> 00:33:27,623
- I have an idea. - The middle?

929
00:33:27,753 --> 00:33:28,852
Could you put...

930
00:33:28,853 --> 00:33:30,622
some more sauce on top?

931
00:33:30,623 --> 00:33:31,992
It's to make it new.

932
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:33,363
Sure.

933
00:33:35,023 --> 00:33:38,433
(Worried about the delivery going wrong)

934
00:33:39,933 --> 00:33:41,062
That's a big bite.

935
00:33:41,063 --> 00:33:42,873
- Could we share... - That was daring. Will it be okay?

936
00:33:43,073 --> 00:33:44,503
We shouldn't take too long. We must go.

937
00:33:45,643 --> 00:33:47,272
Would you like some more sauce?

938
00:33:47,273 --> 00:33:48,302
- We'll just go. - It won't take long.

939
00:33:48,303 --> 00:33:49,412
- Just give me a minute. - No.

940
00:33:49,413 --> 00:33:50,442
One minute is too long.

941
00:33:50,443 --> 00:33:51,942
One minute is too long. Let's go.

942
00:33:51,943 --> 00:33:53,482
- Enjoy your food. - Thank you.

943
00:33:53,483 --> 00:33:55,712
Sang Uk, we'll give you something delicious later.

944
00:33:55,713 --> 00:33:57,012
- During dinner? - Yes.

945
00:33:57,013 --> 00:33:58,783
- Look forward to dinner. - Look forward to it.

946
00:33:59,583 --> 00:34:01,623
- There are three plates. - There's a lot. It's heavy.

947
00:34:01,993 --> 00:34:03,093
Goodness.

948
00:34:03,293 --> 00:34:05,323
- We couldn't taste anything. - The burgers look amazing.

949
00:34:06,263 --> 00:34:08,522
The hamburger size is perfect. It's my favourite.

950
00:34:08,523 --> 00:34:10,032
It fits right in your hand.

951
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:11,033
(His mouth is watering.)

952
00:34:12,763 --> 00:34:15,003
(The size that fits perfectly in your hand)

953
00:34:15,773 --> 00:34:17,703
(First, the cheeseburger)

954
00:34:19,443 --> 00:34:22,273
(A beef patty of premium quality)

955
00:34:24,073 --> 00:34:25,683
(Sprinkling a lot of salt)

956
00:34:26,043 --> 00:34:27,413
(Sizzling)

957
00:34:27,813 --> 00:34:29,453
(Adding the smoky flavour)

958
00:34:30,383 --> 00:34:31,953
(American cheese)

959
00:34:33,583 --> 00:34:35,493
(Mind-blowing)

960
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:39,423
(Onions to reduce the heaviness)

961
00:34:42,133 --> 00:34:43,892
(An explosion of juice with savoury cheese)

962
00:34:43,893 --> 00:34:45,733
(2X double cheeseburger)

963
00:34:46,233 --> 00:34:47,333
(Sniffing)

964
00:34:47,463 --> 00:34:48,532
It smells amazing.

965
00:34:48,533 --> 00:34:51,333
It weighs about 3kg.

966
00:34:51,403 --> 00:34:52,703
- I'm serious. - Give it to me.

967
00:34:54,073 --> 00:34:57,213
(The hamburger chosen as a revelation of hip-hop music)

968
00:34:59,343 --> 00:35:02,383
(How does it taste?)

969
00:35:03,913 --> 00:35:04,953
How is it?

970
00:35:05,283 --> 00:35:06,882
(Happy)

971
00:35:06,883 --> 00:35:08,352
- Is it good? - It tastes amazing.

972
00:35:08,353 --> 00:35:09,453
This is...

973
00:35:09,893 --> 00:35:12,063
Rhymer already finished half of his burger.

974
00:35:12,563 --> 00:35:13,623
It tastes really good.

975
00:35:13,793 --> 00:35:15,293
- You know what? - How is it different?

976
00:35:16,263 --> 00:35:17,693
Including the temperature...

977
00:35:18,433 --> 00:35:22,972
The tenderness of the patty isn't what you would imagine.

978
00:35:22,973 --> 00:35:24,103
It's juicy.

979
00:35:24,773 --> 00:35:26,703
It's not wet. It's moist.

980
00:35:27,743 --> 00:35:29,742
(He's very detailed.)

981
00:35:29,743 --> 00:35:31,813
It's moist and juicy.

982
00:35:31,943 --> 00:35:34,313
The flavour spreads on the palate. It's different from normal burgers.

983
00:35:34,813 --> 00:35:36,482
(Taking a big, moist bite)

984
00:35:36,483 --> 00:35:39,253
Please give me one French fry.

985
00:35:40,953 --> 00:35:43,793
(Tae Hyun also tastes the moistness.)

986
00:35:45,223 --> 00:35:46,963
After tasting this,

987
00:35:47,893 --> 00:35:49,663
I should bring all my children here.

988
00:35:50,133 --> 00:35:53,003
- Are you reminded of them all? - My eldest son would love it.

989
00:35:53,763 --> 00:35:56,333
(Meanwhile, Sang Uk tries his shrimp burger.)

990
00:35:58,433 --> 00:36:01,643
(A heap of carefully cleaned shrimp)

991
00:36:02,213 --> 00:36:04,943
(Crushed and minced)

992
00:36:05,543 --> 00:36:08,312
(When it's shaped...)

993
00:36:08,313 --> 00:36:10,683
(and deep-fried)

994
00:36:13,553 --> 00:36:15,183
(Crunchy)

995
00:36:15,593 --> 00:36:16,952
(Shrimp patty,)

996
00:36:16,953 --> 00:36:17,953
(onions,)

997
00:36:17,954 --> 00:36:19,463
(and another vegetable)

998
00:36:19,823 --> 00:36:23,593
(Covered with their signature wasabi sauce)

999
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:25,603
(Topped with a delicious bun)

1000
00:36:26,063 --> 00:36:28,363
(Pressing hard)

1001
00:36:29,703 --> 00:36:32,643
(The restaurant's signature wasabi shrimp burger)

1002
00:36:33,673 --> 00:36:34,802
- It's so good. - I don't know.

1003
00:36:34,803 --> 00:36:35,873
(Sang Uk takes a bite right away.)

1004
00:36:36,243 --> 00:36:37,743
This is really delicious.

1005
00:36:38,043 --> 00:36:40,813
- This one. - You know this sauce?

1006
00:36:41,143 --> 00:36:42,313
Look at this, Yi Kyung.

1007
00:36:44,213 --> 00:36:45,453
- The meat... - Look at the shrimp meat.

1008
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:46,982
Goodness.

1009
00:36:46,983 --> 00:36:50,653
(The shrimp meat is packed.)

1010
00:36:53,923 --> 00:36:55,633
There's enough wasabi sauce in this.

1011
00:36:56,863 --> 00:36:58,903
(I love it.)

1012
00:36:59,933 --> 00:37:03,532
(He can't stop eating the combo of wasabi and shrimp.)

1013
00:37:03,533 --> 00:37:05,003
You can't compare it to a regular hamburger.

1014
00:37:05,703 --> 00:37:08,343
- The shrimp meat... - Shrimp goes very well with wasabi.

1015
00:37:09,673 --> 00:37:11,372
(The plump shrimp...)

1016
00:37:11,373 --> 00:37:13,613
(with sweet and spicy wasabi is exquisite.)

1017
00:37:13,813 --> 00:37:15,342
Shrimp and wasabi make...

1018
00:37:15,343 --> 00:37:16,353
(Humming)

1019
00:37:17,383 --> 00:37:19,653
This wasabi sauce is very delicious.

1020
00:37:20,653 --> 00:37:23,953
(After the cheeseburger, he takes a bite of the shrimp burger.)

1021
00:37:24,153 --> 00:37:26,222
The shrimp burger is incredible.

1022
00:37:26,223 --> 00:37:27,223
A moment ago...

1023
00:37:27,224 --> 00:37:29,933
It tastes similar to mustard.

1024
00:37:30,363 --> 00:37:32,362
- Really? - It's very sweet...

1025
00:37:32,363 --> 00:37:33,903
and bitter at the same time, so it's good.

1026
00:37:34,363 --> 00:37:36,172
- This is really tasty. - What is it? Is it potatoes?

1027
00:37:36,173 --> 00:37:37,173
This is to die for.

1028
00:37:37,174 --> 00:37:38,572
- Check out the fries. - This is cheese.

1029
00:37:38,573 --> 00:37:39,902
- What exactly did you order? - Fried chicken.

1030
00:37:39,903 --> 00:37:40,973
(An unfamiliar dish was also served.)

1031
00:37:41,873 --> 00:37:43,112
(Nacho chips)

1032
00:37:43,113 --> 00:37:44,372
(Potato bites)

1033
00:37:44,373 --> 00:37:46,213
(Fried chicken tender)

1034
00:37:46,613 --> 00:37:48,682
(Fluffy yellow cheese)

1035
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,783
(Grated cheese)

1036
00:37:50,983 --> 00:37:52,583
(Salsa)

1037
00:37:52,753 --> 00:37:54,622
(Zesty sauce...)

1038
00:37:54,623 --> 00:37:56,453
(and lots of sour cream)

1039
00:37:58,723 --> 00:38:01,522
(A complete side dish spread: The Zesty Casserole)

1040
00:38:01,523 --> 00:38:03,492
I think that's guacamole on top.

1041
00:38:03,493 --> 00:38:05,132
Try the fried chicken.

1042
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:06,332
Isn't this fried chicken?

1043
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:07,933
This is exceptional.

1044
00:38:08,033 --> 00:38:09,072
That right there.

1045
00:38:09,073 --> 00:38:11,502
This sauce. This delicious sauce.

1046
00:38:11,503 --> 00:38:14,643
(Having a bite along with the sauce)

1047
00:38:16,143 --> 00:38:18,812
This is the sauce with that funky smell.

1048
00:38:18,813 --> 00:38:19,983
It's good.

1049
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:21,443
- There's cheese. - Right.

1050
00:38:23,613 --> 00:38:25,523
Should we ask for more sauce?

1051
00:38:25,723 --> 00:38:27,522
- It's fine. - I'll ask for more sauce.

1052
00:38:27,523 --> 00:38:28,753
- It's okay. - We're good.

1053
00:38:29,453 --> 00:38:31,052
He'll return with more napkins while he's at it.

1054
00:38:31,053 --> 00:38:32,223
- It's fine. - We're good.

1055
00:38:32,823 --> 00:38:34,262
This place is also famous.

1056
00:38:34,263 --> 00:38:35,592
(Dong Hyun is back from placing additional orders.)

1057
00:38:35,593 --> 00:38:37,333
Our country has a lot of delicious restaurants.

1058
00:38:37,563 --> 00:38:38,862
(Suspecting that he ate something)

1059
00:38:38,863 --> 00:38:40,902
This place has the best burgers.

1060
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:42,503
Dong Hyun, good job.

1061
00:38:43,203 --> 00:38:44,432
- What? - Really?

1062
00:38:44,433 --> 00:38:45,873
- He went back and forth twice. - No way.

1063
00:38:46,743 --> 00:38:48,273
Seung Ho and I also made the round trip.

1064
00:38:48,343 --> 00:38:49,512
He did it twice.

1065
00:38:49,513 --> 00:38:50,942
I was going to get you napkins.

1066
00:38:50,943 --> 00:38:52,342
- Did you place the order for us? - Yes.

1067
00:38:52,343 --> 00:38:53,813
- Exactly. - Thanks.

1068
00:38:56,383 --> 00:38:58,452
- That was out of the blue. - Rhymer, earlier,

1069
00:38:58,453 --> 00:39:00,252
I didn't say anything when you stole...

1070
00:39:00,253 --> 00:39:01,523
the sesame oil.

1071
00:39:01,653 --> 00:39:03,392
I even said you guys should play again...

1072
00:39:03,393 --> 00:39:04,522
since you were the only one who didn't get to eat.

1073
00:39:04,523 --> 00:39:06,922
I hated the look in your eyes...

1074
00:39:06,923 --> 00:39:08,092
when you were eating.

1075
00:39:08,093 --> 00:39:09,393
(I hated it!)

1076
00:39:09,893 --> 00:39:12,562
- I can't seem to forget it. - Rhymer, that's...

1077
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:14,562
- The others... - That's just how my eyes are.

1078
00:39:14,563 --> 00:39:15,672
I didn't mind the others...

1079
00:39:15,673 --> 00:39:18,133
since it seemed like they were joking.

1080
00:39:18,333 --> 00:39:20,672
Meanwhile, there was clear disdain in your eyes.

1081
00:39:20,673 --> 00:39:22,343
(You were truly looking down on me!)

1082
00:39:22,473 --> 00:39:23,812
That's just the way I look.

1083
00:39:23,813 --> 00:39:25,472
Rhymer, here you go.

1084
00:39:25,473 --> 00:39:26,883
(Sure thing)

1085
00:39:27,043 --> 00:39:28,382
(Meanwhile, Yi Kyung hopes for a chance to freeload.)

1086
00:39:28,383 --> 00:39:30,313
- Thanks for this. - Rhymer's been holding a grudge.

1087
00:39:30,413 --> 00:39:32,852
Can I try a piece that fell off the plate?

1088
00:39:32,853 --> 00:39:34,982
- What fell off the plate? - Sure.

1089
00:39:34,983 --> 00:39:36,052
Actually,

1090
00:39:36,053 --> 00:39:37,992
this is what you wanted.

1091
00:39:37,993 --> 00:39:39,122
Seriously? What?

1092
00:39:39,123 --> 00:39:40,123
Are you letting him have it?

1093
00:39:40,124 --> 00:39:41,763
Let them play a game.

1094
00:39:43,033 --> 00:39:44,493
(Into his mouth)

1095
00:39:45,863 --> 00:39:48,363
(As if)

1096
00:39:49,033 --> 00:39:51,702
Is that how I looked at you?

1097
00:39:51,703 --> 00:39:52,703
(Is that how I looked at you?)

1098
00:39:52,773 --> 00:39:53,802
I felt so bad...

1099
00:39:53,803 --> 00:39:55,473
that I couldn't even look at you.

1100
00:39:56,073 --> 00:39:57,242
But...

1101
00:39:57,243 --> 00:39:58,743
Rhymer's truly one of us now.

1102
00:39:59,413 --> 00:40:01,142
- I can't believe him. - He was so on point.

1103
00:40:01,143 --> 00:40:02,383
(Getting his revenge)

1104
00:40:02,453 --> 00:40:03,912
Doesn't it feel like...

1105
00:40:03,913 --> 00:40:05,552
a good time to play a game?

1106
00:40:05,553 --> 00:40:06,852
All the dishes have been served, so...

1107
00:40:06,853 --> 00:40:08,353
We haven't tried everything yet.

1108
00:40:08,723 --> 00:40:09,993
When he just ate...

1109
00:40:11,053 --> 00:40:12,053
From what I can tell,

1110
00:40:12,054 --> 00:40:13,623
- Rhymer... - He was that desperate.

1111
00:40:13,663 --> 00:40:14,893
Give him some as well.

1112
00:40:17,093 --> 00:40:19,102
He's on your team, Rhymer.

1113
00:40:19,103 --> 00:40:20,533
You're on the same team.

1114
00:40:20,663 --> 00:40:22,502
Why would you treat your teammate like that?

1115
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,303
You shouldn't do that to just about everyone.

1116
00:40:24,433 --> 00:40:25,672
- Why... - I forgot.

1117
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,772
- Why did you target Tae Hyun? - I'm sorry.

1118
00:40:27,773 --> 00:40:29,373
- Why target Tae Hyun? - Of course.

1119
00:40:29,545 --> 00:40:31,075
It's just that...

1120
00:40:31,643 --> 00:40:33,283
I felt so annoyed earlier.

1121
00:40:33,443 --> 00:40:35,382
He got the answer earlier.

1122
00:40:35,383 --> 00:40:37,753
I answered "heart" correctly.

1123
00:40:39,283 --> 00:40:40,553
- The bell's ringing. - It's ringing.

1124
00:40:40,578 --> 00:40:41,978
Seung Ho, go and get them.

1125
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,122
It's every man for himself.

1126
00:40:43,188 --> 00:40:45,968
(Seung Ho makes a quick delivery.)

1127
00:40:45,969 --> 00:40:47,069
I'll enjoy.

1128
00:40:47,629 --> 00:40:48,728
It's beef.

1129
00:40:48,729 --> 00:40:49,739
(Cutting it in half for the freeloaders)

1130
00:40:50,499 --> 00:40:52,738
- No way. - Check out the size of that.

1131
00:40:52,739 --> 00:40:54,368
- How about this? - Like this?

1132
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,369
Like this.
Pass.

1133
00:40:56,439 --> 00:40:58,439
I've never tasted these flavours before.

1134
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:00,805
Since we cut both burgers in half,

1135
00:41:00,922 --> 00:41:03,684
the first one to win will get the chance...

1136
00:41:03,719 --> 00:41:05,518
to choose.

1137
00:41:05,519 --> 00:41:06,818
One of us won't get to eat.

1138
00:41:06,819 --> 00:41:08,218
One of us won't get to eat,

1139
00:41:08,219 --> 00:41:10,488
so the two winners will choose.

1140
00:41:10,489 --> 00:41:11,718
We'll either play a game...

1141
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,989
or share if we want to.

1142
00:41:13,089 --> 00:41:14,729
Let's have them play the 369 game.

1143
00:41:14,759 --> 00:41:16,459
The variation where we do the hooray on fives.

1144
00:41:17,167 --> 00:41:17,980
Yi Kyung...

1145
00:41:18,299 --> 00:41:20,528
- could make it to about 1,000. - Come on.

1146
00:41:20,529 --> 00:41:22,439
You think too highly of me.

1147
00:41:22,469 --> 00:41:23,598
Besides,

1148
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,168
I've had this before and am full.

1149
00:41:25,169 --> 00:41:26,868
I hate how Yi Kyung...

1150
00:41:26,869 --> 00:41:29,138
doesn't desperately want a bite.

1151
00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:30,379
(I hate how he doesn't look desperate.)

1152
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:32,078
I'm already full...

1153
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,748
- and have been here before. - I see.

1154
00:41:33,749 --> 00:41:35,918
It's frustrating that he doesn't even look desperate.

1155
00:41:35,919 --> 00:41:36,644
How about this?

1156
00:41:36,919 --> 00:41:38,618
If that's how it's going to be, we'll do this.

1157
00:41:38,619 --> 00:41:39,949
- How? - We'll switch things up.

1158
00:41:40,089 --> 00:41:41,919
We do hoorays on a multiple of five...

1159
00:41:42,089 --> 00:41:43,789
and clap on 1, 2, and 9.

1160
00:41:43,889 --> 00:41:46,258
- One, two, and nine? - Okay?

1161
00:41:46,259 --> 00:41:47,358
- One... - One, two, and nine?

1162
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:48,788
Will the chant be, "1, 2, 9, 1, 2, 9?"

1163
00:41:48,789 --> 00:41:49,858
Yes, 1, 2, 9.

1164
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:51,798
- One, two, and nine? - What about 11, then?

1165
00:41:51,799 --> 00:41:53,429
- You have to keep on clapping. - That came out of nowhere.

1166
00:41:53,729 --> 00:41:54,999
On 11, you'll do this.

1167
00:41:55,229 --> 00:41:56,439
And hooray.

1168
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,138
- On 11? - What?

1169
00:41:58,139 --> 00:42:00,308
Why would you do hooray on 11?

1170
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,708
Let's just play the 369 game.

1171
00:42:02,709 --> 00:42:04,408
(Just forget it. Let it go.)

1172
00:42:04,409 --> 00:42:06,048
- No can do. - It's a first for all of us.

1173
00:42:06,049 --> 00:42:07,049
That could've been a disaster.

1174
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:08,449
Thanks for stopping me.

1175
00:42:08,909 --> 00:42:10,378
He had no idea what he was suggesting.

1176
00:42:10,379 --> 00:42:12,219
- How could you have not known? - That was close.

1177
00:42:12,419 --> 00:42:14,448
To the original 369 game, you'll hooray on a multiple of five.

1178
00:42:14,449 --> 00:42:15,918
- Hooray on a multiple of five. - Hooray on a multiple of five.

1179
00:42:15,919 --> 00:42:17,018
Who's going first?

1180
00:42:17,019 --> 00:42:18,688
- Dong Hyun. - You'll come this way.

1181
00:42:18,689 --> 00:42:20,958
- Three, six, nine - Three, six, nine

1182
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:22,129
- One. - Two.

1183
00:42:22,429 --> 00:42:23,599
- Four. - Hooray.

1184
00:42:24,159 --> 00:42:25,298
- Seven. - Eight.

1185
00:42:25,299 --> 00:42:26,698
(Spectating while eating)

1186
00:42:26,699 --> 00:42:28,329
- Twenty-one. - Twenty-two.

1187
00:42:28,969 --> 00:42:29,998
Twenty-four.

1188
00:42:29,999 --> 00:42:31,099
Hooray.

1189
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:32,808
Twenty-seven.

1190
00:42:32,809 --> 00:42:33,839
Twenty-eight.

1191
00:42:34,269 --> 00:42:35,269
Hooray.

1192
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,278
(Bouncing)

1193
00:42:36,279 --> 00:42:37,279
Hold on.
- Wait. - What was that?

1194
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:39,779
What on earth was this?

1195
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:41,008
What was this?

1196
00:42:41,009 --> 00:42:42,849
- What? - Just a second.

1197
00:42:43,179 --> 00:42:45,549
Yi Kyung's number was 30, right?

1198
00:42:45,919 --> 00:42:47,188
He had to clap while saying hooray.

1199
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,449
Yes, because it was 30.

1200
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:50,489
What did he do instead?

1201
00:42:50,589 --> 00:42:51,689
Twenty-eight.

1202
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:53,959
(Yi Kyung only said hooray.)

1203
00:42:54,289 --> 00:42:56,129
Sure. You should get to eat.

1204
00:42:56,599 --> 00:42:57,959
Okay. Do we each get one?

1205
00:42:58,029 --> 00:42:59,469
- There are two. - One for each?

1206
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,498
Play a game to decide who gets to choose.

1207
00:43:02,499 --> 00:43:03,869
We can have one person have them all.

1208
00:43:04,199 --> 00:43:05,368
We can have one person have them all.

1209
00:43:05,369 --> 00:43:06,509
One person eats all?

1210
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:08,669
- Which would you like? - We'll allow that.

1211
00:43:08,709 --> 00:43:09,738
- One person eats all? - Yes.

1212
00:43:09,739 --> 00:43:10,838
- Only one gets to eat. - One person eats all?

1213
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:11,878
Bring it on!

1214
00:43:11,879 --> 00:43:13,579
- One person eats all? - I'm good at this game.

1215
00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:15,849
- Three, six, nine - Three, six, nine

1216
00:43:15,979 --> 00:43:17,049
- One. - Two.

1217
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:18,819
- Four. - Hooray.

1218
00:43:20,019 --> 00:43:22,589
(Fast-forwarding)

1219
00:43:22,819 --> 00:43:24,059
- Twenty-one. - Twenty-two.

1220
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,259
- Twenty-four. - Twenty-five!

1221
00:43:27,389 --> 00:43:28,389
Twenty-five!

1222
00:43:29,499 --> 00:43:31,029
(The game for freeloaders ends!)

1223
00:43:31,659 --> 00:43:34,229
(You should've said hooray on a multiple of 5.)

1224
00:43:34,769 --> 00:43:37,239
- This was always Seung Ho's. - Unbelievable.

1225
00:43:38,069 --> 00:43:40,069
Twenty-five!

1226
00:43:40,209 --> 00:43:41,338
Why...

1227
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:43,179
But these burgers are delicious.

1228
00:43:43,609 --> 00:43:45,308
Should I eat it like Tae Hyun?

1229
00:43:45,309 --> 00:43:47,078
- Have small bites. - There's no need to eat it all.

1230
00:43:47,079 --> 00:43:49,219
- I'll start with this one. - Sounds good.

1231
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:50,378
The sauce...

1232
00:43:50,379 --> 00:43:52,588
The one eating could have to pay for all this.

1233
00:43:52,589 --> 00:43:54,549
- He eats it gracefully. - He sure does.

1234
00:43:55,019 --> 00:43:56,759
(Yummy)

1235
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:58,119
(Good, isn't it?)

1236
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,328
You're eating it really gracefully.

1237
00:43:59,329 --> 00:44:00,458
The flavours...

1238
00:44:00,459 --> 00:44:01,758
- Exactly. - I know. The flavours are rich.

1239
00:44:01,759 --> 00:44:03,799
It's hard to explain in words.

1240
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:06,728
(If only I did better in the 369 game.)

1241
00:44:06,729 --> 00:44:07,928
How about this?

1242
00:44:07,929 --> 00:44:09,168
(Let's play another game to win the final piece.)

1243
00:44:09,169 --> 00:44:10,268
Yi Kyung, aren't you interested?

1244
00:44:10,269 --> 00:44:12,198
- Only one was allowed to eat. - Exactly.

1245
00:44:12,199 --> 00:44:13,208
We should adhere to the rules.

1246
00:44:13,209 --> 00:44:14,769
Since when did we stick to the rules?

1247
00:44:14,809 --> 00:44:17,979
Has there ever been a day...

1248
00:44:18,039 --> 00:44:19,379
when we actually...

1249
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:21,008
followed the rules?

1250
00:44:21,009 --> 00:44:23,348
We usually break the rules about five minutes in.

1251
00:44:23,349 --> 00:44:26,689
Why are you suddenly acting like you have good manners?

1252
00:44:26,849 --> 00:44:28,589
Get a grip on yourself.

1253
00:44:29,489 --> 00:44:30,788
- Unbelievable. - You're right.

1254
00:44:30,789 --> 00:44:33,159
- What on earth... - I can't argue with that.

1255
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:35,759
- How much is it? - Seung Ho barely ate.

1256
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:38,698
- The total is 114 dollars. - That's not too bad.

1257
00:44:38,699 --> 00:44:40,469
- The total is 114 dollars. - That's affordable.

1258
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:43,098
Rhymer needs to end his losing streak...

1259
00:44:43,099 --> 00:44:44,268
right about now.

1260
00:44:44,269 --> 00:44:45,938
- Exactly. It needs to end. - It needs to be over,

1261
00:44:45,939 --> 00:44:47,809
or he could end up paying for all our meals today.

1262
00:44:48,039 --> 00:44:49,239
Here's the question.

1263
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:52,848
I'm sure you've been to a drive-through...

1264
00:44:52,849 --> 00:44:54,878
where you place your order from your car.

1265
00:44:54,879 --> 00:44:55,949
- We have. - Sure.

1266
00:44:56,349 --> 00:44:58,418
However, this system wasn't first implemented...

1267
00:44:58,419 --> 00:45:00,149
by an eatery.

1268
00:45:00,249 --> 00:45:01,988
It was designed...

1269
00:45:01,989 --> 00:45:05,559
to let customers place orders anonymously for safety reasons.

1270
00:45:05,719 --> 00:45:09,159
What was the first place to implement...

1271
00:45:09,399 --> 00:45:10,898
the drive-through system?

1272
00:45:10,899 --> 00:45:11,928
This is an easy one.

1273
00:45:11,929 --> 00:45:13,168
This is easy.

1274
00:45:13,169 --> 00:45:14,598
- It's too easy. - Do you all know the answer?

1275
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:16,538
Without revealing your identity?

1276
00:45:16,539 --> 00:45:17,839
Think about firearms and weapons.

1277
00:45:18,239 --> 00:45:19,568
At a weapons store?

1278
00:45:19,569 --> 00:45:21,039
They have a drive-through system?

1279
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,178
Two grenades, please.

1280
00:45:23,179 --> 00:45:24,308
Right.

1281
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:25,539
An M16, please.

1282
00:45:27,579 --> 00:45:29,779
"Two grenades, please."

1283
00:45:30,649 --> 00:45:31,718
Identities...

1284
00:45:31,719 --> 00:45:33,289
Without revealing who you are?

1285
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:36,188
Maybe it was for buying something embarrassing.

1286
00:45:36,189 --> 00:45:37,659
Could it be an adult novelty store?

1287
00:45:38,189 --> 00:45:39,658
- Maybe it was something like that. - That's a good one.

1288
00:45:39,659 --> 00:45:40,758
For their safety?

1289
00:45:40,759 --> 00:45:42,558
- Because... - It makes sense.

1290
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:44,829
- Because it's embarrassing. - While staying anonymous.

1291
00:45:45,559 --> 00:45:47,469
- Well... - What are you going to order?

1292
00:45:47,499 --> 00:45:48,898
I mean...

1293
00:45:48,899 --> 00:45:50,099
(I mean...)

1294
00:45:50,339 --> 00:45:51,739
He can't seem to say it.

1295
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,408
"That thing."

1296
00:45:54,409 --> 00:45:55,409
"That."

1297
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:57,208
"That. You know what I'm talking about."

1298
00:45:57,209 --> 00:45:59,238
- Couldn't it be something... - "That!"

1299
00:45:59,239 --> 00:46:00,348
like that?

1300
00:46:00,349 --> 00:46:01,678
Those orders should be placed face to face...

1301
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:03,249
so that you can see each other's expressions.

1302
00:46:03,919 --> 00:46:05,149
While staying anonymous.

1303
00:46:05,379 --> 00:46:07,148
- This is a tough one. - I'm clueless.

1304
00:46:07,149 --> 00:46:08,748
- It's tougher than you think. - This is a tough one.

1305
00:46:08,749 --> 00:46:11,318
Think about what it means to stay anonymous.

1306
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:12,518
Maybe it's dangerous...

1307
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,859
or it involves money.

1308
00:46:14,059 --> 00:46:15,159
Think of banks.

1309
00:46:16,029 --> 00:46:17,258
- Withdrawals. - Banks.

1310
00:46:17,259 --> 00:46:18,898
Staying anonymous in banking...

1311
00:46:18,899 --> 00:46:21,368
- That's the opposite of safe. - It can't be a bank.

1312
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:23,839
You can only receive service after verifying your identity.

1313
00:46:24,769 --> 00:46:27,708
Could it be accommodations?

1314
00:46:27,709 --> 00:46:29,378
You pay as you drive in.

1315
00:46:29,379 --> 00:46:31,338
- That could work. - While in the car.

1316
00:46:31,339 --> 00:46:32,478
Accommodations...

1317
00:46:32,479 --> 00:46:33,608
- make the most sense. - Right?

1318
00:46:33,609 --> 00:46:35,509
- I agree. - Let's go with that, then.

1319
00:46:35,679 --> 00:46:36,719
- We'll answer. - Go ahead.

1320
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:39,079
Accommodations.

1321
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:40,888
Your answer is accommodations.

1322
00:46:40,889 --> 00:46:42,019
We have to get it right now, so...

1323
00:46:42,189 --> 00:46:43,858
We're right. That is the only answer.

1324
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:44,959
- It's the answer. - They're correct.

1325
00:46:46,359 --> 00:46:48,689
(Will he escape from paying 6 consecutive times?)

1326
00:46:49,629 --> 00:46:50,998
- It's correct. - I think it's incorrect.

1327
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:52,559
- It's incorrect. - It was incorrect.

1328
00:46:53,469 --> 00:46:55,298
- Now, it's an individual game. - It's so hard.

1329
00:46:55,299 --> 00:46:56,699
- They are on their own now. - It's so difficult.

1330
00:46:56,999 --> 00:46:58,238
It's an individual game now.

1331
00:46:58,239 --> 00:47:00,308
- Go for the weapon shop. - Can they say the answer now?

1332
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:01,708
- "The weapon shop." - Go for it.

1333
00:47:01,709 --> 00:47:04,338
- Get it right to be exempt. - I got it. A weapon shop.

1334
00:47:04,339 --> 00:47:05,408
A weapon shop?

1335
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:06,409
(A weapon shop)
- Incorrect. - Good gracious.

1336
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,749
I got it. An adult toy shop.

1337
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,349
An adult toy shop? Incorrect.

1338
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:14,319
I got it. A bank.

1339
00:47:14,419 --> 00:47:15,848
- A bank. - I don't think so.

1340
00:47:15,849 --> 00:47:17,089
- Correct. - See?

1341
00:47:18,519 --> 00:47:19,629
- Correct. - See?

1342
00:47:20,889 --> 00:47:22,758
I told you, Rhymer.

1343
00:47:22,759 --> 00:47:24,698
(Thank you, Yi Kyung.)

1344
00:47:24,699 --> 00:47:26,529
- Rhymer. - I told you.

1345
00:47:26,569 --> 00:47:29,499
- Goodness. - This was an easy one.

1346
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:30,768
- It was a bank. - Right, Rhymer.

1347
00:47:30,769 --> 00:47:32,568
What I said was correct.

1348
00:47:32,569 --> 00:47:34,509
- Finally! - Was it like an ATM?

1349
00:47:34,669 --> 00:47:35,769
- The automated... - Let me explain.

1350
00:47:36,179 --> 00:47:38,508
During the Great Depression in the 1930s,

1351
00:47:38,509 --> 00:47:40,878
there were so many bank robbers and snatchers in the US.

1352
00:47:40,879 --> 00:47:41,908
- That's right. - Yes.

1353
00:47:41,909 --> 00:47:44,048
The bank came up with a safe way for their customers...

1354
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:46,788
to make deposits without revealing their identities.

1355
00:47:46,789 --> 00:47:48,089
It was to make deposits.

1356
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:51,188
My goodness.

1357
00:47:51,189 --> 00:47:52,418
(Retrieving his credit card)

1358
00:47:52,419 --> 00:47:54,459
- He put an end to it. - He ended the losing streak.

1359
00:47:54,689 --> 00:47:57,498
- It's a first after six meals. - Gosh. Thank you.

1360
00:47:57,499 --> 00:48:00,028
- That's true. - Do you see it's not rigged now?

1361
00:48:00,029 --> 00:48:03,538
- I really freeloaded on this one. - Yes.

1362
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:04,868
Goodness.

1363
00:48:04,869 --> 00:48:06,868
- For the first time. - Gosh.

1364
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:08,069
(Thumbs up)

1365
00:48:08,269 --> 00:48:10,079
Handsome Guys!

1366
00:48:11,139 --> 00:48:12,178
(Totally satisfied with the show)

1367
00:48:12,179 --> 00:48:14,278
He ate for free for the first time.

1368
00:48:14,279 --> 00:48:15,509
Thank you for the food.

1369
00:48:16,919 --> 00:48:18,378
You know I'm good at 1-on-1 matches, right?

1370
00:48:18,379 --> 00:48:19,688
- Exactly. - I'll do it fast.

1371
00:48:19,689 --> 00:48:22,918
This is an ingredient frequently used to make burgers.

1372
00:48:22,919 --> 00:48:25,118
It's known to be good for your stamina.

1373
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:26,258
What? It's interesting already.

1374
00:48:26,259 --> 00:48:29,188
- I know it. - In 17th-century England,

1375
00:48:29,189 --> 00:48:31,158
it was banned to eat this...

1376
00:48:31,159 --> 00:48:33,799
because they forbid pursuing pleasure.

1377
00:48:34,299 --> 00:48:35,498
What is this?

1378
00:48:35,499 --> 00:48:37,468
- Is it in the burger? - There are only a few ingredients.

1379
00:48:37,469 --> 00:48:38,838
I got it. Lettuce?

1380
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:40,438
Lettuce? Incorrect.

1381
00:48:40,439 --> 00:48:43,608
- For pleasure? - There's one thing for stamina.

1382
00:48:43,609 --> 00:48:44,808
It's obvious.

1383
00:48:44,809 --> 00:48:47,378
- That is it. - I got it. Meat?

1384
00:48:47,379 --> 00:48:48,508
Meat? Incorrect.

1385
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:50,919
- I got it. Onions. - Onions? Incorrect.

1386
00:48:51,149 --> 00:48:52,848
I got it. What was it? Pickles.

1387
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:53,988
Pickles? Incorrect.

1388
00:48:53,989 --> 00:48:55,418
You have to hurry and go for it.

1389
00:48:55,419 --> 00:48:57,059
- I can't think of anything. - Just go for it.

1390
00:48:57,389 --> 00:48:59,158
(On the sesame bun, there are beef)

1391
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:01,158
(Lettuce, cheese, pickles)

1392
00:49:01,159 --> 00:49:02,359
I got it. Pickles?

1393
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,529
- He already said it. - Listen to others' answers.

1394
00:49:04,659 --> 00:49:05,899
(And onions)

1395
00:49:05,959 --> 00:49:07,329
- What's in a burger? - What's in it?

1396
00:49:07,499 --> 00:49:08,969
- Analyse it. - I know.

1397
00:49:09,229 --> 00:49:12,339
For stamina? What's good for stamina?

1398
00:49:12,469 --> 00:49:14,808
- Stamina. - Look at me.

1399
00:49:14,809 --> 00:49:16,378
You don't even have to look for it.

1400
00:49:16,379 --> 00:49:19,308
Besides the answers you two just said,

1401
00:49:19,309 --> 00:49:21,248
- what wasn't mentioned? - Well, if you think of...

1402
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,878
the ingredients in tomatoes...

1403
00:49:22,879 --> 00:49:24,148
I got it. Tomatoes?

1404
00:49:24,149 --> 00:49:25,748
(Tomatoes)

1405
00:49:25,749 --> 00:49:27,248
- Dong Hyun. - For goodness' sake.

1406
00:49:27,249 --> 00:49:29,018
- What? - Come on.

1407
00:49:29,019 --> 00:49:30,359
- What? - Tomatoes?

1408
00:49:30,519 --> 00:49:31,619
- Is it correct? - Correct.

1409
00:49:31,689 --> 00:49:33,088
- Why? - How could you say the answer?

1410
00:49:33,089 --> 00:49:35,088
- Why did you say that? - What did I say?

1411
00:49:35,089 --> 00:49:37,958
- You just said, "tomatoes." - Did I say that?

1412
00:49:37,959 --> 00:49:39,668
- Come on. - Did I say "tomatoes?"

1413
00:49:39,669 --> 00:49:40,898
(He's still confused.)

1414
00:49:40,899 --> 00:49:43,638
- Really? - You said, "tomatoes."

1415
00:49:43,639 --> 00:49:45,039
(Embarrassed)

1416
00:49:45,239 --> 00:49:46,669
- Did I say that? - Thank you.

1417
00:49:46,909 --> 00:49:48,208
- Come on. - I wondered why you yelled at me.

1418
00:49:48,209 --> 00:49:49,779
Dong Hyun should pay, then.

1419
00:49:51,379 --> 00:49:53,178
- Should I pay it? - I'm finally getting free food,

1420
00:49:53,179 --> 00:49:55,179
but it has to be the youngest one who is buying.

1421
00:49:55,949 --> 00:49:58,119
I feel so uneasy about it.

1422
00:49:58,449 --> 00:50:01,718
This is so uncomfortable. Seriously.

1423
00:50:01,719 --> 00:50:03,119
Then you pay it again.

1424
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:06,988
(I'm not saying that, Tae Hyun.)

1425
00:50:06,989 --> 00:50:08,328
Should I pay for it, then?

1426
00:50:08,329 --> 00:50:10,058
- Well, that's hard to say. - In that case,

1427
00:50:10,059 --> 00:50:12,898
- can I make a suggestion? - What is it?

1428
00:50:12,899 --> 00:50:14,268
- Last time, - Yes.

1429
00:50:14,269 --> 00:50:15,568
- Rhymer... - What about me?

1430
00:50:15,569 --> 00:50:17,698
- bought the food for me. - Yes, I did.

1431
00:50:17,699 --> 00:50:19,809
- I was the youngest that day. - He was the youngest.

1432
00:50:20,309 --> 00:50:23,039
(Rhymer was upset that the youngest had to pay.)

1433
00:50:23,439 --> 00:50:25,979
(I'll pay for it and look cool.)

1434
00:50:26,779 --> 00:50:28,348
- I was the youngest that day. - He was the youngest.

1435
00:50:28,349 --> 00:50:30,178
Sang Uk is really the youngest one.

1436
00:50:30,179 --> 00:50:33,718
Since I had a couple of bites, if you let me pay for it, I will.

1437
00:50:33,719 --> 00:50:35,788
Why are you looking cool all of a sudden?

1438
00:50:35,789 --> 00:50:37,888
- Seriously. - How heart-warming it is.

1439
00:50:37,889 --> 00:50:38,889
It's crazy.

1440
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:40,829
If we were to be this heart-warming,

1441
00:50:41,629 --> 00:50:43,959
Sang Un is the youngest that I've met for the first time.

1442
00:50:44,029 --> 00:50:46,828
- Don't do it. No. - Hold on.

1443
00:50:46,829 --> 00:50:49,668
- Don't do it. - Come on. Listen.

1444
00:50:49,669 --> 00:50:52,869
I mean, I bought the food for everyone else here.

1445
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:54,908
- Come on. - After that,

1446
00:50:54,909 --> 00:50:57,409
I can't leave without buying food for him.

1447
00:50:57,639 --> 00:50:58,678
Doesn't it make sense?

1448
00:50:58,679 --> 00:51:00,108
- Come on. Why? - Why?

1449
00:51:00,109 --> 00:51:02,048
- What is this? - Think about it.

1450
00:51:02,049 --> 00:51:03,148
- Tae Hyun. - Hold on.

1451
00:51:03,149 --> 00:51:04,149
Seriously.

1452
00:51:04,150 --> 00:51:05,548
In the end, is it you again?

1453
00:51:05,549 --> 00:51:07,618
- I mean, he's the youngest. - That makes sense.

1454
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:10,158
He was acting so kindly.

1455
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:13,589
And I wanted to be the kind one.

1456
00:51:14,159 --> 00:51:16,759
I'm not sure if it was their strategy.

1457
00:51:19,199 --> 00:51:20,298
I couldn't help it.

1458
00:51:20,299 --> 00:51:21,329
Today...

1459
00:51:22,099 --> 00:51:24,299
I think I've seen this shot on TV.

1460
00:51:24,969 --> 00:51:26,538
Gosh. I'm paying again.

1461
00:51:26,539 --> 00:51:28,609
- It's 114 dollars. - Okay.

1462
00:51:29,009 --> 00:51:31,678
- I wanted to buy you some food. - Thank you.

1463
00:51:31,679 --> 00:51:33,279
Thank you. We enjoyed it.

1464
00:51:33,849 --> 00:51:36,149
- Thank you. - Sure. I got to do this.

1465
00:51:37,349 --> 00:51:38,848
From now on, I'll never pay.

1466
00:51:38,849 --> 00:51:40,788
This is the end.

1467
00:51:40,789 --> 00:51:42,989
(Will it be the end?)

1468
00:51:45,289 --> 00:51:50,259
(After 2 hours)

1469
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:52,599
As you can see, we're at a cafe.

1470
00:51:53,229 --> 00:51:55,298
- Isn't it such a nice cafe? - It is.

1471
00:51:55,299 --> 00:51:57,198
Everything in Seongsu-dong has a concept.

1472
00:51:57,199 --> 00:51:59,808
I asked the owner and found out...

1473
00:51:59,809 --> 00:52:01,409
that his mother used to be a seamstress.

1474
00:52:02,409 --> 00:52:03,708
He opened this cafe...

1475
00:52:03,709 --> 00:52:05,239
with his mother.

1476
00:52:05,679 --> 00:52:08,649
He has combined the cafe with sewing equipment...

1477
00:52:08,709 --> 00:52:10,249
that symbolizes his mother's life.

1478
00:52:10,919 --> 00:52:13,048
- I love Seongsu-dong. - Right?

1479
00:52:13,049 --> 00:52:16,419
I'm excited about which restaurants we'll be heading for dinner.

1480
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:18,788
There are so many things to eat in Seongsu-dong.

1481
00:52:18,789 --> 00:52:20,428
There are a variety of dishes.

1482
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,758
- It's really famous. - Gamjatang. Right.

1483
00:52:22,759 --> 00:52:24,198
-That place is... - It's known for its gamjatang.

1484
00:52:24,199 --> 00:52:25,528
When nothing was around,

1485
00:52:25,529 --> 00:52:26,668
like the place we had lunch...

1486
00:52:26,669 --> 00:52:28,198
- Sir. - It was at that intersection.

1487
00:52:28,199 --> 00:52:30,099
- Sir. - As for gamjatang...

1488
00:52:31,169 --> 00:52:33,239
I'll get an iced Americano.

1489
00:52:34,539 --> 00:52:35,669
What? WOONG.

1490
00:52:36,539 --> 00:52:37,579
(WOONG.)

1491
00:52:37,879 --> 00:52:39,878
- Sir. - What are you doing here?

1492
00:52:39,879 --> 00:52:41,249
- Rhymer. - What?

1493
00:52:41,509 --> 00:52:42,848
What's going on?

1494
00:52:42,849 --> 00:52:44,579
- Rhymer. - What brought you here?

1495
00:52:44,679 --> 00:52:45,679
What is it?

1496
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:49,549
(What's going on?)

1497
00:52:49,649 --> 00:52:50,818
- Hello. - This is our...

1498
00:52:50,819 --> 00:52:52,488
- Look at him. - Unbelievable.

1499
00:52:52,489 --> 00:52:54,758
- What are you doing? - It's JEON WOONG of AB6IX.

1500
00:52:54,759 --> 00:52:56,429
- Hello, everyone. - Yes.

1501
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,899
He's wearing a mic.

1502
00:53:02,269 --> 00:53:05,299
- This is Handsome Guys. - I see. Hello.

1503
00:53:05,639 --> 00:53:07,838
- It's crazy. - He suddenly entered from the back.

1504
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:10,008
- What is this? - No, I'm serious.

1505
00:53:10,009 --> 00:53:10,913
Who is he?

1506
00:53:11,179 --> 00:53:14,049
Hello, I'm JEON WOONG of AB6IX.

1507
00:53:15,779 --> 00:53:22,249
(He's the main vocalist of AB6IX, the idol group Rhymer created.)

1508
00:53:23,389 --> 00:53:29,459
(With various talents, he's performed as a solo too.)

1509
00:53:30,459 --> 00:53:34,298
(JEON WOONG of AB6IX)

1510
00:53:34,299 --> 00:53:35,468
- Hold on. What do we do? - Gosh.

1511
00:53:35,469 --> 00:53:37,098
Explain how you cooked up his entrance, Rhymer.

1512
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:38,468
- What happened? - We didn't cook up anything.

1513
00:53:38,469 --> 00:53:39,738
I was really surprised.

1514
00:53:39,739 --> 00:53:42,108
- He's wearing a mic. - What are you saying?

1515
00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:45,208
Stop lying. I was surprised when he went through the cameras.

1516
00:53:45,209 --> 00:53:48,008
- I bought food for you all. - Yes.

1517
00:53:48,009 --> 00:53:49,509
Let it slide quietly.

1518
00:53:49,549 --> 00:53:51,379
(Laughing)

1519
00:53:51,719 --> 00:53:53,448
- How much did you spend, sir? - What?

1520
00:53:53,449 --> 00:53:56,248
- How much did you spend? - About 250 dollars.

1521
00:53:56,249 --> 00:53:59,058
- I spent about 250 dollars. - I can't believe this.

1522
00:53:59,059 --> 00:54:02,558
- I like his tone. - He's very bubbly.

1523
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,428
Are you going to join us today, WOONG?

1524
00:54:04,429 --> 00:54:06,968
- Please let him. - He should come with us.

1525
00:54:06,969 --> 00:54:08,468
He should have two meals while he's here.

1526
00:54:08,469 --> 00:54:10,399
He has to bring his credit card.

1527
00:54:10,899 --> 00:54:13,239
- What about WOONG's card? - My card is right here.

1528
00:54:13,339 --> 00:54:15,038
(WOONG's credit card)

1529
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:17,539
It's breathing right here.

1530
00:54:18,609 --> 00:54:19,638
- Is that so? - Yes.

1531
00:54:19,639 --> 00:54:21,248
In that case, I'll do this.

1532
00:54:21,249 --> 00:54:23,448
- If WOONG has to pay, - If so, are you going to pay?

1533
00:54:23,449 --> 00:54:24,619
- I'll pay. - Gosh.

1534
00:54:24,849 --> 00:54:26,688
But I don't think it'll happen.

1535
00:54:26,689 --> 00:54:28,288
He keeps making excuses to pay.

1536
00:54:28,289 --> 00:54:30,158
No. WOONG is very...

1537
00:54:30,159 --> 00:54:31,959
What are today's dinner menu recommendations?

1538
00:54:32,189 --> 00:54:34,958
- I've done my research. - Good job.

1539
00:54:34,959 --> 00:54:36,599
There's Galbi Street here.

1540
00:54:36,659 --> 00:54:38,229
Is there Galbi Street?

1541
00:54:38,629 --> 00:54:40,168
There used to be many restaurants,

1542
00:54:40,169 --> 00:54:42,299
but only three remain today.

1543
00:54:42,669 --> 00:54:43,799
Gosh. I know that place.

1544
00:54:43,999 --> 00:54:45,669
They use briquettes, don't they?

1545
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:48,839
Is it beef or pork?

1546
00:54:49,139 --> 00:54:50,908
- It's pork. - Pork galbi.

1547
00:54:50,909 --> 00:54:52,779
It has an old-school vibe.

1548
00:54:53,279 --> 00:54:55,549
- I love that. - And they bring out the briquettes.

1549
00:54:55,949 --> 00:54:58,579
It's perfect for a day-drinking while eating the grilled meat.

1550
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,018
- For day-drinking. - Yes.

1551
00:55:00,019 --> 00:55:01,219
And there's an izakaya, a Japanese pub.

1552
00:55:01,649 --> 00:55:02,888
- An izakaya? - Those two.

1553
00:55:02,889 --> 00:55:04,858
Instead of serving lots of dishes,

1554
00:55:04,859 --> 00:55:07,228
they only serve a few they are good at making.

1555
00:55:07,229 --> 00:55:08,489
They only sell those.

1556
00:55:08,759 --> 00:55:10,028
(Today's DMR)

1557
00:55:10,029 --> 00:55:11,659
(Dinner Menu Recommendations)

1558
00:55:11,829 --> 00:55:14,268
(Briquette pork galbi at an old restaurant...)

1559
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,699
(versus trendy dishes at an izakaya)

1560
00:55:16,839 --> 00:55:18,398
Actually,

1561
00:55:18,399 --> 00:55:20,809
it's leading me to galbi.

1562
00:55:21,209 --> 00:55:22,769
- What's leading you? - In Seongsu-dong...

1563
00:55:23,239 --> 00:55:25,908
Is it your stomach, heart, or belly?

1564
00:55:25,909 --> 00:55:27,048
- Your head or heart? - Your heart.

1565
00:55:27,049 --> 00:55:30,179
- I don't think it's his head. - My shins. It's my shins.

1566
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:31,678
(Shins?)

1567
00:55:31,679 --> 00:55:33,118
- Your shins are leading you. - His shins.

1568
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,449
I always make a move after considering many things.

1569
00:55:35,619 --> 00:55:37,758
- I will choose... - As a person who had it.

1570
00:55:37,759 --> 00:55:39,118
- to go to the izakaya. - Okay.

1571
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,388
I've been to the galbi places many times.

1572
00:55:40,389 --> 00:55:41,389
(Yi Kyung has chosen the izakaya.)

1573
00:55:41,459 --> 00:55:43,798
- Where do you want to go, WOONG? - WOONG. Right.

1574
00:55:43,799 --> 00:55:46,328
My favourite food is galbi.

1575
00:55:46,329 --> 00:55:47,969
I'll choose galbi.

1576
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:50,098
What about you? It's hard, isn't it?

1577
00:55:50,099 --> 00:55:53,309
There is only one thing I can think of.

1578
00:55:53,909 --> 00:55:55,008
I want to go home...

1579
00:55:55,009 --> 00:55:56,938
after having a draft beer at the izakaya.

1580
00:55:56,939 --> 00:55:58,238
(He wants to go home after having a drink.)

1581
00:55:58,239 --> 00:55:59,808
It's the izakaya for you, then.

1582
00:55:59,809 --> 00:56:02,908
- That sounds good. - I don't need anything else.

1583
00:56:02,909 --> 00:56:04,448
- Just one glass. - That's how I feel.

1584
00:56:04,449 --> 00:56:05,548
I'll choose the izakaya.

1585
00:56:05,549 --> 00:56:06,818
- The izakaya? - Yes.

1586
00:56:06,819 --> 00:56:08,049
- The izakaya. Okay. - Yes.

1587
00:56:08,089 --> 00:56:11,359
I prefer seafood over meat.

1588
00:56:11,559 --> 00:56:13,858
- Right. We have 3 for the izakaya. - There are 3 for the izakaya.

1589
00:56:13,859 --> 00:56:15,029
I like them both.

1590
00:56:15,329 --> 00:56:16,529
Where are you going to go?

1591
00:56:18,359 --> 00:56:21,828
I was going to follow you.

1592
00:56:21,829 --> 00:56:23,268
Should we go to the same place?

1593
00:56:23,269 --> 00:56:25,369
Right. Where do you want to go?

1594
00:56:26,569 --> 00:56:27,768
- Galbi sounds good. - Galbi.

1595
00:56:27,769 --> 00:56:28,808
What do you think?

1596
00:56:28,809 --> 00:56:30,138
Have what you want, so you won't regret it.

1597
00:56:30,139 --> 00:56:31,279
- Yes. - Should I?

1598
00:56:32,109 --> 00:56:33,748
Actually, I crave galbi.

1599
00:56:33,749 --> 00:56:35,148
- Eat galbi, then. - I'll go for galbi.

1600
00:56:35,149 --> 00:56:36,878
- Let's have galbi. - Okay.

1601
00:56:36,879 --> 00:56:38,978
Then WOONG, Rhymer,

1602
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:40,788
- Dong Hyun, and I choose galbi. - Galbi.

1603
00:56:40,789 --> 00:56:42,849
Gosh. It looks...

1604
00:56:43,759 --> 00:56:45,488
- Is it the same again? - It's serious.

1605
00:56:45,489 --> 00:56:46,489
Again?

1606
00:56:46,490 --> 00:56:48,288
WOONG is the only one I can rely on.

1607
00:56:48,289 --> 00:56:49,628
I've met him for the first time today.

1608
00:56:49,629 --> 00:56:54,468
WOONG, are you good at common sense or quizzes?

1609
00:56:54,469 --> 00:56:57,169
I'm not that different from Rhymer.

1610
00:56:57,639 --> 00:56:58,669
That's good.

1611
00:57:00,369 --> 00:57:05,039
Seung Ho has to get there by driving the car by himself.

1612
00:57:05,379 --> 00:57:07,809
I have to study after a long time.

1613
00:57:08,379 --> 00:57:11,619
From now on, what matters is where we're going first.

1614
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:13,179
- We'll go to the izakaya first. - What?

1615
00:57:13,449 --> 00:57:14,449
What?

1616
00:57:14,450 --> 00:57:15,648
Of course, WOONG is coming with us.

1617
00:57:15,649 --> 00:57:17,819
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1618
00:57:18,119 --> 00:57:19,358
Of course.

1619
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,589
(Let's go to the izakaya with WOONG!)

1620
00:57:21,989 --> 00:57:24,859
(The Cafe Street in Seongsu-dong)

1621
00:57:25,199 --> 00:57:26,499
It's already packed.

1622
00:57:27,269 --> 00:57:28,699
- It's still a weekday. - Right.

1623
00:57:28,729 --> 00:57:31,369
- Is it always crowded? - I feel like everyone is here.

1624
00:57:31,969 --> 00:57:33,739
Seongsu-dong is packed with people.

1625
00:57:33,869 --> 00:57:35,769
- It's crazy. - I heard it was popular.

1626
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:37,909
You don't really go to a trendy place, do you?

1627
00:57:38,009 --> 00:57:39,409
Not really.

1628
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:42,449
I understand why this place is trendy.

1629
00:57:42,779 --> 00:57:44,079
- It's crazy. - Is it here?

1630
00:57:44,219 --> 00:57:45,219
It's here.

1631
00:57:45,649 --> 00:57:46,649
- Is it here? - It's here.

1632
00:57:46,650 --> 00:57:47,719
This is it.

1633
00:57:48,149 --> 00:57:49,889
Goodness. It looks delicious.

1634
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:51,859
- Gosh. - It's the izakaya.

1635
00:57:52,019 --> 00:57:53,629
They do straw-grilling.

1636
00:57:53,689 --> 00:57:55,229
Gosh. It looks nice here.

1637
00:57:58,299 --> 00:58:00,698
(A unique combination...)

1638
00:58:00,699 --> 00:58:05,169
(between the burning straw and the izakaya)

1639
00:58:06,839 --> 00:58:09,209
It has a subtle smoked flavour from the straw.

1640
00:58:09,609 --> 00:58:13,309
I like its vibe, and the food is tasty.

1641
00:58:13,549 --> 00:58:15,408
When I have an impromptu get-together with my friends.

1642
00:58:15,409 --> 00:58:17,078
I can be a good spot for a blind date.

1643
00:58:17,079 --> 00:58:18,619
(It's a perfect spot for friends or a blind date.)

1644
00:58:20,819 --> 00:58:24,958
(DMR 1: Izakaya)

1645
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,389
Since it does straw grilling, it has straw.

1646
00:58:26,689 --> 00:58:27,859
Hello.

1647
00:58:28,729 --> 00:58:30,729
I like the vibe of this.

1648
00:58:31,259 --> 00:58:33,969
Tae Hyun, let's call the owner and ask.

1649
00:58:33,999 --> 00:58:35,399
- The squid should be... - Excuse me.

1650
00:58:35,429 --> 00:58:36,528
Hello?

1651
00:58:36,529 --> 00:58:38,338
- Hello. - Hi.

1652
00:58:38,339 --> 00:58:39,769
- He's so young. - Goodness.

1653
00:58:40,069 --> 00:58:42,968
I see a frame of straw as it's your signature dish.

1654
00:58:42,969 --> 00:58:44,138
- Yes, you're right. - It's a straw frame.

1655
00:58:44,139 --> 00:58:45,678
Straw is your main item.

1656
00:58:45,679 --> 00:58:47,278
How did you come up with it?

1657
00:58:47,279 --> 00:58:49,149
We started cooking with straw...

1658
00:58:49,379 --> 00:58:51,178
because I studied abroad in Kochi Prefecture, Japan,

1659
00:58:51,179 --> 00:58:53,348
which is famous for its straw-grilled dishes.

1660
00:58:53,349 --> 00:58:54,419
- You studied there. - Yes.

1661
00:58:54,549 --> 00:58:56,388
Since I lived alone,

1662
00:58:56,389 --> 00:58:59,819
the old ladies cooked me side dishes and meat, and they were so good.

1663
00:59:00,259 --> 00:59:03,128
So I thought it'd be great to serve them here.

1664
00:59:03,129 --> 00:59:05,798
What is the dish inspired by those ladies?

1665
00:59:05,799 --> 00:59:07,298
- It's the braised tendon. - The braised tendon.

1666
00:59:07,299 --> 00:59:08,368
It was unbelievably good.

1667
00:59:08,369 --> 00:59:09,369
- Was it unbelievable? - Yes.

1668
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:11,338
"Sodesune."

1669
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,369
Right.

1670
00:59:13,269 --> 00:59:15,438
Come on. We're at an izakaya, a Japanese pub.

1671
00:59:15,439 --> 00:59:16,669
Sure. Okay.

1672
00:59:17,209 --> 00:59:18,308
That's right.

1673
00:59:18,309 --> 00:59:19,638
(That's right.)

1674
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,508
You will regret it if you don't try...

1675
00:59:21,509 --> 00:59:23,249
straw-grilled chuck flap tail tataki and fried eggplant.

1676
00:59:23,579 --> 00:59:25,119
You're right. They're the best dishes.

1677
00:59:25,349 --> 00:59:27,188
We'll have three draft beers.

1678
00:59:27,189 --> 00:59:28,648
Three draft beers. Got it.

1679
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:31,218
- I'll get Korean beer. - Okay.

1680
00:59:31,219 --> 00:59:32,258
- Thank you. - Yes.

1681
00:59:32,259 --> 00:59:35,558
(Straw-grilled braised tendon, drinks)

1682
00:59:35,559 --> 00:59:38,729
What have you eaten so far today, WOONG?

1683
00:59:38,799 --> 00:59:40,769
I had two pieces of chicken breast.

1684
00:59:41,099 --> 00:59:44,538
- What? - I have a concert this week.

1685
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:46,098
- Right. It's this weekend. - In Japan?

1686
00:59:46,099 --> 00:59:48,138
- There's a fan concert. - It's a fan concert.

1687
00:59:48,139 --> 00:59:50,238
I'm in the period of controlling myself.

1688
00:59:50,239 --> 00:59:53,009
Have you asked your boss when your next album is coming?

1689
00:59:53,139 --> 00:59:54,248
It's in August.

1690
00:59:54,249 --> 00:59:55,448
- It's soon. - Yes.

1691
00:59:55,449 --> 00:59:56,878
That's our plan.

1692
00:59:56,879 --> 00:59:58,278
It will be soon after this show is aired.

1693
00:59:58,279 --> 00:59:59,879
It's not so long after this.

1694
01:00:00,289 --> 01:00:02,288
WOONG composed a song for this album.

1695
01:00:02,289 --> 01:00:04,888
Gosh. Do I have to disclose such information...

1696
01:00:04,889 --> 01:00:06,418
on a show like Handsome Guys?

1697
01:00:06,419 --> 01:00:07,428
You have to.

1698
01:00:07,429 --> 01:00:08,959
"On a show like Handsome Guys?"

1699
01:00:09,429 --> 01:00:11,898
Don't do it. Don't do it, then.

1700
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:14,169
I didn't say that. It was all Rhymer.

1701
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,569
I mean...

1702
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:18,939
For the upcoming AB6IX's album,

1703
01:00:19,069 --> 01:00:21,638
did you compose or write a song, Rhymer?

1704
01:00:21,639 --> 01:00:23,538
- I don't do that these days. - No, he didn't.

1705
01:00:23,539 --> 01:00:27,249
When he takes part in a song, the song always includes...

1706
01:00:27,509 --> 01:00:28,808
(Hey)

1707
01:00:28,809 --> 01:00:29,979
(Ho)

1708
01:00:30,749 --> 01:00:32,748
(Laughing)

1709
01:00:32,749 --> 01:00:35,388
(It's crazy.)

1710
01:00:35,389 --> 01:00:37,489
(WOONG...)

1711
01:00:37,959 --> 01:00:41,429
His "Hey" is always in the song.

1712
01:00:42,229 --> 01:00:44,859
(Should we check it out?)

1713
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:46,629
(Hey)

1714
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,169
(If you missed it, listen carefully.)

1715
01:00:49,369 --> 01:00:50,369
(Ho)

1716
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:55,038
(Forget the bad memories)

1717
01:00:55,039 --> 01:00:56,239
You're old, indeed.

1718
01:00:56,879 --> 01:00:58,578
- That detail. - That's it.

1719
01:00:58,579 --> 01:00:59,709
- Did you three order beers? - Yes.

1720
01:00:59,779 --> 01:01:01,248
- No. It's the three of us. - I see.

1721
01:01:01,249 --> 01:01:02,449
(The 3 draft beers came out first.)

1722
01:01:03,209 --> 01:01:04,249
It's carbonated.

1723
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,889
That must be so creamy to swallow.

1724
01:01:07,019 --> 01:01:08,689
- That's good. - Okay.

1725
01:01:08,949 --> 01:01:09,949
Okay.

1726
01:01:10,359 --> 01:01:11,419
(Hey)

1727
01:01:11,659 --> 01:01:12,719
(Ho)

1728
01:01:14,329 --> 01:01:18,299
(It's perfect to spice up the mood.)

1729
01:01:18,529 --> 01:01:19,699
I'm having PTSD.

1730
01:01:20,369 --> 01:01:21,869
We'll cheer with that chant today.

1731
01:01:24,499 --> 01:01:27,539
(Sipping in a good mood)

1732
01:01:28,939 --> 01:01:30,578
- It's perfect in this weather. - It's perfect.

1733
01:01:30,579 --> 01:01:31,579
I love it.
Right now.

1734
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:34,748
I think it's better to drink this...

1735
01:01:34,749 --> 01:01:36,109
- for the freeloading chance. - It's the best.

1736
01:01:36,479 --> 01:01:37,479
(Is that so?)

1737
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:38,749
- In this weather... - Yes.

1738
01:01:39,149 --> 01:01:40,219
In that case...

1739
01:01:40,549 --> 01:01:42,119
I can't help it. The four of you, play rock-paper-scissors.

1740
01:01:42,349 --> 01:01:43,958
- Hey. Have a sip. - Okay.

1741
01:01:43,959 --> 01:01:45,518
- Have a sip. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1742
01:01:45,519 --> 01:01:46,519
It's just a sip.

1743
01:01:46,520 --> 01:01:47,588
It's over when your lips are detached from the glass.

1744
01:01:47,589 --> 01:01:48,628
- Have a sip. - A sip.

1745
01:01:48,629 --> 01:01:50,058
Okay. Ready or not,

1746
01:01:50,059 --> 01:01:51,999
- rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1747
01:01:54,199 --> 01:01:56,769
(Rhymer wins the freeloading chance to drink the draft beer.)

1748
01:01:56,969 --> 01:01:59,138
(Standing up)

1749
01:01:59,139 --> 01:02:00,568
Hey!

1750
01:02:00,569 --> 01:02:01,768
(Excited)

1751
01:02:01,769 --> 01:02:02,938
Have a sip.

1752
01:02:02,939 --> 01:02:04,279
It was really good.

1753
01:02:04,539 --> 01:02:06,839
Gosh. I'm on fire.

1754
01:02:07,249 --> 01:02:08,849
- I'm on fire today. - Look at him.

1755
01:02:09,579 --> 01:02:11,349
(Laughing)

1756
01:02:11,779 --> 01:02:13,048
(Chugging)

1757
01:02:13,049 --> 01:02:15,849
You can drink it up and finish it.

1758
01:02:16,449 --> 01:02:17,519
- Gosh. - Goodness.

1759
01:02:18,419 --> 01:02:20,188
(Amazed)

1760
01:02:20,189 --> 01:02:21,729
(Frustrated)

1761
01:02:23,289 --> 01:02:25,828
(The ending fairy)

1762
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:26,829
(Hey)

1763
01:02:27,069 --> 01:02:28,099
(Ho)

1764
01:02:28,829 --> 01:02:30,228
(He even ends it perfectly.)

1765
01:02:30,229 --> 01:02:31,299
It's crazy.

1766
01:02:31,999 --> 01:02:33,769
- I was so surprised. - Gosh.

1767
01:02:33,939 --> 01:02:35,509
How did he finish it at once?

1768
01:02:36,369 --> 01:02:37,379
Gosh. That was good.

1769
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:39,779
- I could gulp it easily. - At once.

1770
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:42,778
He already paid for two meals for lunch.

1771
01:02:42,779 --> 01:02:44,918
But after drinking, he went,

1772
01:02:44,919 --> 01:02:46,779
"I'm on fire today."

1773
01:02:47,619 --> 01:02:48,948
It hurts me.

1774
01:02:48,949 --> 01:02:51,058
(That was a good freeloading chance.)

1775
01:02:51,059 --> 01:02:53,089
- The food is coming. - Yes.

1776
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:54,629
It's fast.

1777
01:02:55,059 --> 01:02:59,198
(It's visually extraordinary.)

1778
01:02:59,199 --> 01:03:00,429
The plate is so...

1779
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:02,398
- That's the tataki. - Yes.

1780
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:03,528
- Gosh. - That's...

1781
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:05,569
(The signature straw-grilled chuck flap tail tataki)

1782
01:03:05,799 --> 01:03:07,839
- Should we try it? - Take some first.

1783
01:03:07,969 --> 01:03:10,039
- Add the meat. - Are they all raw?

1784
01:03:10,269 --> 01:03:11,978
- Dip it in this sauce. - Yes.

1785
01:03:11,979 --> 01:03:13,609
- Spill them on the floor. - And put it on here.

1786
01:03:13,749 --> 01:03:16,249
Add the radish sprouts and onions too.

1787
01:03:17,049 --> 01:03:18,678
That's right. Don't forget spring onions.

1788
01:03:18,679 --> 01:03:19,749
- Spring onions. - That's right. The spring onions.

1789
01:03:20,589 --> 01:03:21,919
- You have to add spring onions. - Good.

1790
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:23,119
This is...

1791
01:03:23,349 --> 01:03:24,888
Is it raw? Is it lightly cooked?

1792
01:03:24,889 --> 01:03:26,119
It's tataki, so it's lightly seared.

1793
01:03:26,959 --> 01:03:28,629
They seared it lightly over the straw fire.

1794
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,658
- That's why it smells like this. - I can smell it.

1795
01:03:31,659 --> 01:03:33,128
- It has a smoky flavour. - It's smoky.

1796
01:03:33,129 --> 01:03:34,969
- I can smell it. - It's smoky.

1797
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:40,669
(They cook the chuck flap tail by putting straw on fire.)

1798
01:03:41,339 --> 01:03:45,709
(The slightly seared facade is the key.)

1799
01:03:47,749 --> 01:03:50,879
(Looking tasty)

1800
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:53,748
(The smoky scent from the straw...)

1801
01:03:53,749 --> 01:03:57,719
(is absorbed in the chuck flap tail tataki.)

1802
01:03:57,889 --> 01:03:59,658
It has to be tasty.

1803
01:03:59,659 --> 01:04:01,288
- Yes. - It's chuck flap tail, isn't it?

1804
01:04:01,289 --> 01:04:02,689
Its smoky scent is crazy.

1805
01:04:03,489 --> 01:04:04,498
It's chuck flap tail.

1806
01:04:04,499 --> 01:04:06,829
- I can smell the smoked meat. - Gosh.

1807
01:04:07,099 --> 01:04:08,369
At the first bite,

1808
01:04:08,869 --> 01:04:10,769
you can smell whiskey.

1809
01:04:10,799 --> 01:04:11,799
- What? - What?

1810
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,509
When you drink a really smoky whiskey,

1811
01:04:14,639 --> 01:04:16,639
- you can smell the oak. - Single malt whiskies.

1812
01:04:18,809 --> 01:04:20,848
(After sniffing the smoky scent,)

1813
01:04:20,849 --> 01:04:23,678
(he puts it into his mouth.)

1814
01:04:23,679 --> 01:04:25,879
It's covered with the scent.

1815
01:04:26,061 --> 01:04:27,248
This is that thing.

1816
01:04:27,249 --> 01:04:28,588
- It's Cheongyang chilli. - Cheongyang chilli.

1817
01:04:28,589 --> 01:04:29,848
(What...)

1818
01:04:29,849 --> 01:04:31,288
(is this?)

1819
01:04:31,289 --> 01:04:33,359
- It's because... - What is it?

1820
01:04:33,459 --> 01:04:34,988
Hey, I've never had anything...

1821
01:04:34,989 --> 01:04:36,088
that tasted like this before.

1822
01:04:36,089 --> 01:04:37,259
- Really? - Is that so?

1823
01:04:37,799 --> 01:04:39,728
Sniff it first. It smells like a single malt whiskey.

1824
01:04:39,729 --> 01:04:41,429
- It's like beef tartare. - Right?

1825
01:04:41,899 --> 01:04:42,899
But it's not beef tartare.

1826
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:45,068
- Its smokiness is crazy. - Yes. Isn't it?

1827
01:04:45,069 --> 01:04:46,698
The scent of the smoked straw circles around in my mouth.

1828
01:04:46,699 --> 01:04:47,908
It's straw-grilled, indeed.

1829
01:04:47,909 --> 01:04:49,438
- That scent is really strong. - Gosh.

1830
01:04:49,439 --> 01:04:51,379
(He's curious.)

1831
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:55,049
(He tries it without any toppings.)

1832
01:04:55,409 --> 01:04:57,009
- That scent is really strong. - Gosh.

1833
01:04:57,779 --> 01:04:59,019
I love how it smells.

1834
01:05:00,919 --> 01:05:02,349
It's nice and comfortable.

1835
01:05:02,889 --> 01:05:03,959
It's clean.

1836
01:05:05,389 --> 01:05:06,558
(Tae Hyun loves the tataki.)

1837
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,689
It's gone already.

1838
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:11,928
It melts in my mouth.

1839
01:05:11,929 --> 01:05:13,869
- I have something to say. - What is it?

1840
01:05:14,299 --> 01:05:16,469
WOONG looks so sad.

1841
01:05:17,399 --> 01:05:18,399
Why?

1842
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:19,738
I want him to try a bite before we do anything.

1843
01:05:19,739 --> 01:05:20,768
Yes.

1844
01:05:20,769 --> 01:05:22,568
- This is what this show is like. - Seriously.

1845
01:05:22,569 --> 01:05:24,008
- As he's here for the first time... - How grateful!

1846
01:05:24,009 --> 01:05:25,309
But we can't give it to him for free.

1847
01:05:25,739 --> 01:05:26,878
- Play rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1848
01:05:26,879 --> 01:05:29,448
Plot it out so that he can eat.

1849
01:05:29,449 --> 01:05:31,818
We'll play rock-paper-scissors fair and square.

1850
01:05:31,819 --> 01:05:32,819
What should I give?

1851
01:05:32,820 --> 01:05:34,448
- An eggplant. No, tataki? - One bite.

1852
01:05:34,449 --> 01:05:35,848
- We'll let WOONG win. - A piece of tataki.

1853
01:05:35,849 --> 01:05:37,158
- It should be at least 2 pieces. - Then 2 pieces.

1854
01:05:37,159 --> 01:05:38,358
Two pieces sound good.

1855
01:05:38,359 --> 01:05:40,318
(The freeloading menu is two pieces of tataki.)

1856
01:05:40,319 --> 01:05:42,459
- Men should always put out a rock. - Of course.

1857
01:05:42,629 --> 01:05:44,499
That means, rock, rock...

1858
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:47,059
- Paper, rock. - That's how it'll go.

1859
01:05:47,529 --> 01:05:48,769
- Okay. - Okay.

1860
01:05:49,069 --> 01:05:50,568
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Scissors.

1861
01:05:50,569 --> 01:05:53,908
(Rock-paper-scissors)

1862
01:05:53,909 --> 01:05:55,738
(Rock, rock, paper, rock)

1863
01:05:55,739 --> 01:05:57,839
(Paper, paper, paper, scissors)

1864
01:05:59,839 --> 01:06:03,878
(Handsome members won't let you down.)

1865
01:06:03,879 --> 01:06:05,078
See?

1866
01:06:05,079 --> 01:06:06,079
Look at them.
(Shocked)

1867
01:06:07,649 --> 01:06:10,418
This is what it's like to be here.

1868
01:06:10,419 --> 01:06:12,219
- Did you see that? - Goodness, Rhymer, the boss.

1869
01:06:12,759 --> 01:06:13,958
Gosh, Rhymer.

1870
01:06:13,959 --> 01:06:15,358
(Embarrassed)

1871
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:16,528
- What are you doing... - You changed it too.

1872
01:06:16,529 --> 01:06:18,158
with the innocent people?

1873
01:06:18,159 --> 01:06:19,728
- Gosh, these people. - Still...

1874
01:06:19,729 --> 01:06:21,829
I'm most disappointed with my boss.

1875
01:06:22,399 --> 01:06:23,698
- No, I was... - I'm so disappointed.

1876
01:06:23,699 --> 01:06:25,139
- I apologise. - I have goosebumps.

1877
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:27,408
- This is what one should do. - Hold on.

1878
01:06:27,409 --> 01:06:28,809
(WOONG gets to learn a good lesson.)

1879
01:06:28,939 --> 01:06:30,439
- Have two pieces. - I'll have them at once.

1880
01:06:30,539 --> 01:06:31,739
- Sounds good. - Yes. You should eat them at once.

1881
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,248
You have to put a little bit of onion.

1882
01:06:34,249 --> 01:06:35,349
- Like this? - Yes.

1883
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:38,049
- Get some radish sprouts too. - Rhymer.

1884
01:06:38,149 --> 01:06:39,149
The chilli pepper is very spicy.

1885
01:06:39,150 --> 01:06:40,748
- Just a little bit. - Be careful.

1886
01:06:40,749 --> 01:06:42,318
- Shall I eat it like this? - That's right.

1887
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:44,418
- Enjoy it as much as you can. - Okay.

1888
01:06:44,419 --> 01:06:45,489
Gosh, it's...

1889
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:47,258
(Eating)

1890
01:06:47,259 --> 01:06:48,559
It's nerve-racking because he doesn't usually eat it.

1891
01:06:48,889 --> 01:06:50,659
That's right. I'm really nervous too.

1892
01:06:50,759 --> 01:06:51,898
- Is it smoky? - What?

1893
01:06:51,899 --> 01:06:52,998
It really tastes like whiskey.

1894
01:06:52,999 --> 01:06:54,468
- It does, right? - Yes.

1895
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:55,599
It really tastes like whiskey.

1896
01:06:55,629 --> 01:06:56,698
That's the aroma.

1897
01:06:56,699 --> 01:06:58,738
(Clapping)

1898
01:06:58,739 --> 01:06:59,768
It's really tasty.

1899
01:06:59,769 --> 01:07:00,868
- The aroma... - Tataki.

1900
01:07:00,869 --> 01:07:02,338
When you eat seasoned food...

1901
01:07:02,339 --> 01:07:03,438
while being on a diet...

1902
01:07:03,439 --> 01:07:05,108
that mostly consists of chicken breast,

1903
01:07:05,109 --> 01:07:07,408
every sense of your body gets awakened.

1904
01:07:07,409 --> 01:07:09,279
You feel it three times more than other people.

1905
01:07:09,749 --> 01:07:11,178
Your eyes suddenly turned teary.

1906
01:07:11,179 --> 01:07:13,219
- It's so tasty. - You suddenly gain energy.

1907
01:07:13,649 --> 01:07:14,948
If you overreact like that,

1908
01:07:14,949 --> 01:07:17,189
people will think that I don't buy you such dishes.

1909
01:07:17,759 --> 01:07:19,518
Back in the day,

1910
01:07:19,519 --> 01:07:21,528
he used to buy us beef for team dinners.

1911
01:07:21,529 --> 01:07:22,889
- Now, he buys us pork. - Pork?

1912
01:07:23,489 --> 01:07:25,159
- Here's the thing. - Why do you do that?

1913
01:07:25,229 --> 01:07:26,629
Pork is tasty.

1914
01:07:26,899 --> 01:07:29,699
We ran into each other at a beef restaurant.

1915
01:07:29,869 --> 01:07:33,498
(Read the room, okay?)

1916
01:07:33,499 --> 01:07:35,638
(It'll always be funny.)

1917
01:07:35,639 --> 01:07:38,478
(Shouting, "Hey, ho" works every time.)

1918
01:07:38,479 --> 01:07:40,848
- It's addictive. - Today...

1919
01:07:40,849 --> 01:07:42,209
- It's here. - It's here.

1920
01:07:42,379 --> 01:07:43,909
It's here.

1921
01:07:44,949 --> 01:07:46,779
- Is it braised tendon? - It's braised tendon.

1922
01:07:47,549 --> 01:07:49,448
- It's braised tendon. - Oh, my.

1923
01:07:49,449 --> 01:07:51,958
Hey, I thought it was doenjang.

1924
01:07:51,959 --> 01:07:53,719
- What's this? - It's like gangdoenjang.

1925
01:07:53,989 --> 01:07:55,429
- This is... - Braised tendon.

1926
01:07:56,089 --> 01:07:58,399
- What's this? - Why did we get it?

1927
01:07:59,759 --> 01:08:00,868
Thank you.

1928
01:08:00,869 --> 01:08:01,898
It looks like doenjang stew.

1929
01:08:01,899 --> 01:08:03,799
Is it a bit like doenjang stew?

1930
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:05,599
All right.

1931
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,939
- Yi Kyung, the smell... - How does it smell?

1932
01:08:10,039 --> 01:08:11,908
It has an underlying smoky aroma.

1933
01:08:11,909 --> 01:08:13,308
- You're right. - That's how it smells.

1934
01:08:13,309 --> 01:08:14,309
It's the same as the last one.

1935
01:08:14,310 --> 01:08:16,648
- May I smell it? - The smoky flavour...

1936
01:08:16,649 --> 01:08:18,849
How does it smell smoky?

1937
01:08:19,819 --> 01:08:22,889
(Here's the reason.)

1938
01:08:24,059 --> 01:08:26,488
(The boiled ox knee and chuck flap tail...)

1939
01:08:26,489 --> 01:08:28,959
(are stir-fried over the straw fire.)

1940
01:08:30,529 --> 01:08:33,098
(Then the secret broth that's made with the best combination...)

1941
01:08:33,099 --> 01:08:35,529
(is poured in to seal the aroma.)

1942
01:08:36,569 --> 01:08:38,768
(Then it's boiled again to complete...)

1943
01:08:38,769 --> 01:08:40,939
(the smoky straw-grilled and braised tendon.)

1944
01:08:41,139 --> 01:08:42,208
How strange.

1945
01:08:42,209 --> 01:08:43,869
(They're excited about the taste of the braised tendon.)

1946
01:08:43,909 --> 01:08:45,479
Tendon is...

1947
01:08:45,879 --> 01:08:47,009
Hold on.

1948
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:48,349
What's this?

1949
01:08:48,709 --> 01:08:50,408
- Does it taste like doenjang stew? - No.

1950
01:08:50,409 --> 01:08:51,879
It doesn't taste like doenjang stew.

1951
01:08:52,049 --> 01:08:53,678
I can't describe the taste.

1952
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:54,849
- It's braised. - I haven't had such a thing before.

1953
01:08:56,119 --> 01:08:57,758
It's a taste I've never had before.

1954
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:59,618
Isn't it the same for you? I've never had...

1955
01:08:59,619 --> 01:09:00,828
But you've had...

1956
01:09:00,829 --> 01:09:02,028
tendon dishes before.

1957
01:09:02,029 --> 01:09:03,058
- This is... - It's totally different.

1958
01:09:03,059 --> 01:09:04,359
- It's totally new. - It's new.

1959
01:09:04,429 --> 01:09:05,798
- In a sense, - There isn't a similar dish.

1960
01:09:05,799 --> 01:09:07,599
it's braised tendon.

1961
01:09:08,099 --> 01:09:09,468
It's more like stew.

1962
01:09:09,469 --> 01:09:10,698
It's like stew.

1963
01:09:10,699 --> 01:09:11,898
- Yes, it's like stew. - Rice.

1964
01:09:11,899 --> 01:09:12,938
Add some rice.

1965
01:09:12,939 --> 01:09:15,069
(Let's eat it with rice this time!)

1966
01:09:15,309 --> 01:09:16,708
It's as I expected.

1967
01:09:16,709 --> 01:09:17,779
(Eating)

1968
01:09:19,009 --> 01:09:20,108
Is it sweet and salty?

1969
01:09:20,109 --> 01:09:21,479
- Hey. - It should be eaten with rice.

1970
01:09:21,549 --> 01:09:22,778
This spoonful will be the best.

1971
01:09:22,779 --> 01:09:23,979
Rice takes the crown.

1972
01:09:24,549 --> 01:09:26,319
Rice is so tasty.

1973
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:29,019
It's a meal.

1974
01:09:29,619 --> 01:09:31,419
- Gosh, this is... - It's incredible.

1975
01:09:32,459 --> 01:09:34,158
When you order the earthen pot bulgogi,

1976
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:35,428
- there's a bit of soup. - Yes.

1977
01:09:35,429 --> 01:09:36,758
It's that with a bit of doenjang.

1978
01:09:36,759 --> 01:09:37,759
(I see!)

1979
01:09:38,459 --> 01:09:40,458
- It's a bit sweet. - It's a sweet dish...

1980
01:09:40,459 --> 01:09:42,468
- with a bit of doenjang. - it's salty.

1981
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:44,468
Tendon is in that broth,

1982
01:09:44,469 --> 01:09:46,798
so there's the soft texture.

1983
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:48,139
(The sweet and salty broth and soft tendon harmonize!)

1984
01:09:48,569 --> 01:09:50,338
- I love the broth in bulgogi. - That's right.

1985
01:09:50,339 --> 01:09:52,279
- You eat it with rice. - You have to eat two bowls of rice.

1986
01:09:52,609 --> 01:09:54,248
I'm the most curious about this dish.

1987
01:09:54,249 --> 01:09:55,408
I'm curious about it too.

1988
01:09:55,409 --> 01:09:56,748
I'm so curious about this dish.

1989
01:09:56,749 --> 01:09:58,678
The total is 121 dollars.

1990
01:09:58,679 --> 01:10:00,648
Let's have a quiz for the bill at Seongsu-dong's izakaya.

1991
01:10:00,649 --> 01:10:01,649
Okay.

1992
01:10:02,589 --> 01:10:04,958
- Here comes the question. - Okay.

1993
01:10:04,959 --> 01:10:07,589
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

1994
01:10:08,859 --> 01:10:11,499
At a Japanese restaurant or an izakaya,

1995
01:10:12,199 --> 01:10:14,869
you must've seen this cat often.

1996
01:10:15,299 --> 01:10:16,669
- Yes. - This cat.

1997
01:10:16,729 --> 01:10:17,898
This cat?

1998
01:10:17,899 --> 01:10:19,169
- That's right. - Yes.

1999
01:10:19,369 --> 01:10:20,939
This cat is called...

2000
01:10:21,269 --> 01:10:23,539
maneki neko.

2001
01:10:24,779 --> 01:10:27,749
In Japan, it's considered to be a symbol of luck.

2002
01:10:28,579 --> 01:10:31,648
Depending on which paw is raised,

2003
01:10:31,649 --> 01:10:33,749
the meaning changes.

2004
01:10:34,949 --> 01:10:36,249
- Which paw? - Yes.

2005
01:10:36,289 --> 01:10:38,959
If the right paw is raised, the figurine brings in money.

2006
01:10:39,689 --> 01:10:42,829
If the left paw is raised, the figurine brings in "Blank."

2007
01:10:43,189 --> 01:10:45,028
- It's so easy. - What goes in the blank?

2008
01:10:45,029 --> 01:10:47,258
- It's so easy. - Seriously.

2009
01:10:47,259 --> 01:10:48,598
It's 1 of 2 or 3.

2010
01:10:48,599 --> 01:10:50,129
For goodness' sake.

2011
01:10:50,569 --> 01:10:53,139
(Does it bring in "Hey, ho?")

2012
01:10:53,339 --> 01:10:55,968
(The hey, ho universe hasn't ended yet.)

2013
01:10:55,969 --> 01:10:58,038
- Is that it? - This question is easy.

2014
01:10:58,039 --> 01:10:59,508
There are only 2 or 3 things...

2015
01:10:59,509 --> 01:11:01,078
- a restaurant needs. - That's right.

2016
01:11:01,079 --> 01:11:02,348
Simply put,

2017
01:11:02,349 --> 01:11:03,978
does it bring in money or good health?

2018
01:11:03,979 --> 01:11:05,778
There's only one option.

2019
01:11:05,779 --> 01:11:06,918
Maybe it's good fortune.

2020
01:11:06,919 --> 01:11:08,549
Maybe it's luck.

2021
01:11:08,819 --> 01:11:10,319
- Good fortune. - Money and luck?

2022
01:11:11,189 --> 01:11:13,089
Does it make sense to bring in good health?

2023
01:11:13,819 --> 01:11:15,129
Something that can be brought in.

2024
01:11:16,489 --> 01:11:17,798
We need to throw them off.

2025
01:11:17,799 --> 01:11:19,329
Keep giving the wrong answers.

2026
01:11:19,899 --> 01:11:21,798
Give them anything but the correct answer.

2027
01:11:21,799 --> 01:11:23,168
If it's the correct answer...

2028
01:11:23,169 --> 01:11:24,268
(Understood.)

2029
01:11:24,269 --> 01:11:26,468
There's something that entered my mind.

2030
01:11:26,469 --> 01:11:27,609
(Dong Hyun begins to hinder them.)

2031
01:11:28,509 --> 01:11:30,208
(Leaning)

2032
01:11:30,209 --> 01:11:32,138
People or customers.

2033
01:11:32,139 --> 01:11:33,908
- People? - Does it bring in customers?

2034
01:11:33,909 --> 01:11:35,349
- Did you hear me? - Yes, I could hear you perfectly.

2035
01:11:35,809 --> 01:11:37,179
Seriously.

2036
01:11:37,249 --> 01:11:38,918
- I could hear you perfectly. - My goodness.

2037
01:11:38,919 --> 01:11:41,149
- Money and people. - He has good hearing.

2038
01:11:41,319 --> 01:11:43,648
- I think it's health. - Health?

2039
01:11:43,649 --> 01:11:45,058
I say this...

2040
01:11:45,059 --> 01:11:47,988
because I watch many animated movies and series.

2041
01:11:47,989 --> 01:11:49,588
- Health. - I saw...

2042
01:11:49,589 --> 01:11:53,329
many of these figurines at senior citizens' houses...

2043
01:11:53,354 --> 01:11:55,416
in the animated movies and series.

2044
01:11:56,429 --> 01:11:59,038
- I think health is... - Do you think that's correct?

2045
01:11:59,039 --> 01:12:01,108
- Yes, it's the most plausible. - I think it's good fortune.

2046
01:12:01,175 --> 01:12:01,931
Health?

2047
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:03,109
- Let's go with health then. - Shall we do that?

2048
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:04,208
I think health makes the most amount of sense.

2049
01:12:04,209 --> 01:12:05,238
- Okay. - Seriously.

2050
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:06,839
- You should shout the answer. - Let me answer.

2051
01:12:07,509 --> 01:12:09,608
- Health. - Health?

2052
01:12:09,609 --> 01:12:12,148
Longevity or health.

2053
01:12:12,149 --> 01:12:13,519
It brings in longevity?

2054
01:12:13,649 --> 01:12:15,489
Is longevity included in health?

2055
01:12:15,589 --> 01:12:16,918
- Of course, it is. - I see.

2056
01:12:16,919 --> 01:12:18,188
- You must be healthy to live long. - Hold on.

2057
01:12:18,189 --> 01:12:19,589
You should choose 1 of the 2.

2058
01:12:20,459 --> 01:12:21,658
You must be healthy to live long.

2059
01:12:21,659 --> 01:12:23,928
No. Health and longevity are two different things.

2060
01:12:23,929 --> 01:12:25,758
You could live long in poor health.

2061
01:12:25,759 --> 01:12:26,998
"Gosh, I'm in so much pain."

2062
01:12:26,999 --> 01:12:28,328
- Seriously. - I mean...

2063
01:12:28,329 --> 01:12:29,398
- Who associates... - Listen.

2064
01:12:29,399 --> 01:12:30,828
- longevity with poor health? - Listen.

2065
01:12:30,829 --> 01:12:32,738
- You could be in poor health. - That's right.

2066
01:12:32,739 --> 01:12:34,138
You could say, "I'd rather die..."

2067
01:12:34,139 --> 01:12:35,608
and go over the age of 100.

2068
01:12:35,609 --> 01:12:37,338
You're right.

2069
01:12:37,339 --> 01:12:39,608
Health and longevity are two different things.

2070
01:12:39,609 --> 01:12:41,108
- They're two different things. - Yes.

2071
01:12:41,109 --> 01:12:43,109
- It could just be a long life. - Choose one.

2072
01:12:43,249 --> 01:12:44,718
- One. - Yes.

2073
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:46,078
Go with longevity in good health.

2074
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,418
- Yes. - Go ahead.

2075
01:12:47,419 --> 01:12:48,719
It brings in...

2076
01:12:49,119 --> 01:12:51,519
- Longevity in good health. - longevity in good health.

2077
01:12:52,459 --> 01:12:54,018
Good health and longevity.

2078
01:12:54,019 --> 01:12:55,028
It brings in those things.

2079
01:12:55,029 --> 01:12:59,698
(Longevity in good health)

2080
01:12:59,699 --> 01:13:02,569
(What will be the answer?)

2081
01:13:02,669 --> 01:13:03,728
- Incorrect. - See?

2082
01:13:03,729 --> 01:13:04,899
- They took the wrong direction. - Let me answer.

2083
01:13:05,069 --> 01:13:06,738
(Team Galbi won't pay.)

2084
01:13:06,739 --> 01:13:07,808
Let's go.

2085
01:13:07,809 --> 01:13:09,039
- Let me answer. - Let's go.

2086
01:13:09,139 --> 01:13:10,509
- Good fortune. - Good fortune.

2087
01:13:11,209 --> 01:13:12,238
Incorrect.

2088
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:13,378
- Let me answer. - Hurry up.

2089
01:13:13,379 --> 01:13:14,948
Try what I said earlier.

2090
01:13:14,949 --> 01:13:15,978
- Relationships. - Go ahead.

2091
01:13:15,979 --> 01:13:17,249
What I said earlier.

2092
01:13:17,379 --> 01:13:18,448
- People. - People.

2093
01:13:18,449 --> 01:13:19,618
- It brings in people? - Customers. People.

2094
01:13:19,619 --> 01:13:21,848
- Let me answer. People. - Love?

2095
01:13:21,849 --> 01:13:22,888
- Customers. - People.

2096
01:13:22,889 --> 01:13:23,948
People?

2097
01:13:23,949 --> 01:13:25,619
- Like individuals? - Yes.

2098
01:13:25,719 --> 01:13:27,188
- Correct. - What?

2099
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:28,959
(Answer: People)

2100
01:13:29,129 --> 01:13:30,388
- I told you so! - It's correct.

2101
01:13:30,389 --> 01:13:32,628
(I told you that it was people!)

2102
01:13:32,629 --> 01:13:33,898
I told you so.

2103
01:13:33,899 --> 01:13:35,699
- That's right. Customers. - Really?

2104
01:13:36,129 --> 01:13:37,599
- To be precise, - People.

2105
01:13:37,999 --> 01:13:40,499
- it brings in customers. - Yes. Customers or people.

2106
01:13:41,039 --> 01:13:42,808
The first guess was correct. Customers.

2107
01:13:42,809 --> 01:13:43,968
- Restaurants... - They're at restaurants.

2108
01:13:43,969 --> 01:13:45,409
Yes. That's why they're at restaurants.

2109
01:13:46,079 --> 01:13:47,138
Take your card.

2110
01:13:47,139 --> 01:13:48,279
- People. - My goodness.

2111
01:13:48,449 --> 01:13:49,579
People.

2112
01:13:50,449 --> 01:13:52,948
- Even when Sang Uk got chosen, - Thank you.

2113
01:13:52,949 --> 01:13:54,219
- someone else paid. - I know.

2114
01:13:54,349 --> 01:13:55,349
He's lucky.

2115
01:13:55,350 --> 01:13:56,618
You gave him the answer too.

2116
01:13:56,619 --> 01:13:57,788
It's nice.

2117
01:13:57,789 --> 01:13:58,789
(Sang Uk is lucky in Seongsu.)

2118
01:13:58,790 --> 01:14:00,288
I'll give a question...

2119
01:14:00,289 --> 01:14:03,358
that'll determine who will pay between the two.

2120
01:14:03,359 --> 01:14:04,459
(A bloody battle to avoid the final payment)

2121
01:14:04,629 --> 01:14:06,599
Seongsu-dong is a neighbourhood...

2122
01:14:06,759 --> 01:14:10,029
with the longest bridge from the Joseon Dynasty,

2123
01:14:10,229 --> 01:14:13,069
- Salgoji Bridge. - Salgoji Bridge?

2124
01:14:13,499 --> 01:14:15,068
The name of Salgoji Bridge...

2125
01:14:15,069 --> 01:14:16,368
originates...

2126
01:14:16,369 --> 01:14:18,578
from Taejo Yi Seong Gye's action...

2127
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:20,078
toward his son, Taejong Yi Bang Won...

2128
01:14:20,079 --> 01:14:21,549
according to one theory.

2129
01:14:21,749 --> 01:14:23,078
Which action was it?

2130
01:14:23,079 --> 01:14:24,419
The dad to the son?

2131
01:14:24,579 --> 01:14:26,218
You have a son, so think about it.

2132
01:14:26,219 --> 01:14:27,548
Dong Hyun, do you know?

2133
01:14:27,549 --> 01:14:29,948
I saw a photo of this bridge...

2134
01:14:29,949 --> 01:14:31,288
and took a lesson about it.

2135
01:14:31,289 --> 01:14:32,988
- It's by the Dongbu Expressway. - Yes, it is. It remains.

2136
01:14:32,989 --> 01:14:34,258
- It's there. It's actually there. - It remains.

2137
01:14:34,259 --> 01:14:36,129
- Is it there? - The bridge remains.

2138
01:14:36,259 --> 01:14:39,498
- Give us some information. - Yi Seong Gye had sons.

2139
01:14:39,499 --> 01:14:42,629
Usually, the eldest prince becomes the king.

2140
01:14:42,729 --> 01:14:44,098
There was the eldest prince.

2141
01:14:44,099 --> 01:14:46,068
- During the Revolt of the Princes, - That's right.

2142
01:14:46,069 --> 01:14:47,738
Yi Bang Won...

2143
01:14:47,739 --> 01:14:49,439
killed all the princes...

2144
01:14:49,509 --> 01:14:51,078
and became the king.

2145
01:14:51,079 --> 01:14:52,608
- Did he kill all his brothers? - Yes, he did.

2146
01:14:52,609 --> 01:14:54,549
- Really? - There was the eldest prince.

2147
01:14:54,879 --> 01:14:56,548
What happened...

2148
01:14:56,549 --> 01:14:57,979
must've saddened his father.

2149
01:14:58,249 --> 01:15:00,019
I bet it was like that.

2150
01:15:00,179 --> 01:15:02,249
His son went wild.

2151
01:15:02,549 --> 01:15:04,118
The father...

2152
01:15:04,119 --> 01:15:05,618
Let me answer. The father gave the son...

2153
01:15:05,619 --> 01:15:07,889
- a physical punishment. - A physical punishment.

2154
01:15:08,089 --> 01:15:09,358
He raised a cane.

2155
01:15:09,359 --> 01:15:10,359
(A: Raising a cane)

2156
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,459
Incorrect.

2157
01:15:12,229 --> 01:15:14,399
Maybe it's a sword, not a cane.

2158
01:15:14,629 --> 01:15:16,528
Isn't that too scary? He's the father.

2159
01:15:16,529 --> 01:15:17,998
Yi Bang Won could've killed his father as well...

2160
01:15:17,999 --> 01:15:19,299
to become the king.

2161
01:15:19,469 --> 01:15:20,598
Yi Bang Won could've killed his father...

2162
01:15:20,599 --> 01:15:21,939
- to become the king? - So he could've been worried.

2163
01:15:22,339 --> 01:15:23,408
That's plausible.

2164
01:15:23,409 --> 01:15:24,439
An arrow?

2165
01:15:25,239 --> 01:15:27,479
Let me answer. He directed an arrow toward his son.

2166
01:15:28,009 --> 01:15:30,479
He directed an arrow toward his son and shot it.

2167
01:15:31,219 --> 01:15:32,648
- It must be correct. - Correct.

2168
01:15:32,649 --> 01:15:33,878
(A: Directing and shooting an arrow)

2169
01:15:33,879 --> 01:15:34,889
An arrow.

2170
01:15:35,419 --> 01:15:37,688
That's why it was the longest bridge.

2171
01:15:37,689 --> 01:15:38,788
(The man who shot his shot, Yi Kyung is exempt.)

2172
01:15:38,789 --> 01:15:41,058
The arrow Taejo Yi Seong Gye shot...

2173
01:15:41,059 --> 01:15:42,658
toward Taejong Yi Bang Won missed...

2174
01:15:42,659 --> 01:15:44,088
and hit the ground.

2175
01:15:44,089 --> 01:15:46,458
That was how the name, Salgoji Bridge,

2176
01:15:46,459 --> 01:15:48,199
- originated. - It's a very sad story.

2177
01:15:48,529 --> 01:15:50,069
He shot an arrow at his son.

2178
01:15:50,629 --> 01:15:51,768
Thank you for the food, Tae Hyun.

2179
01:15:51,769 --> 01:15:52,838
(Tae Hyun will pay for the izakaya.)

2180
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:53,898
You know,

2181
01:15:53,899 --> 01:15:56,039
I always pay once.

2182
01:15:57,409 --> 01:15:59,708
Tae Hyun picked up...

2183
01:15:59,709 --> 01:16:01,078
the tab...

2184
01:16:01,079 --> 01:16:03,579
and put an end to Rhymer's consecutive payments.

2185
01:16:04,949 --> 01:16:07,218
(The best way to wrap up)

2186
01:16:07,219 --> 01:16:09,848
(Shouting "Hey, ho" in celebration)

2187
01:16:09,849 --> 01:16:10,948
(Thank you.)

2188
01:16:10,949 --> 01:16:12,159
Congratulations.

2189
01:16:12,589 --> 01:16:13,689
Thank you.

2190
01:16:14,089 --> 01:16:15,228
Here you go.

2191
01:16:15,229 --> 01:16:16,789
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2192
01:16:17,559 --> 01:16:19,398
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

2193
01:16:19,399 --> 01:16:21,468
(Let's leave for DMR 2!)

2194
01:16:21,469 --> 01:16:22,499
That was funny.

2195
01:16:23,069 --> 01:16:25,269
(The night of Seongsu-dong)

2196
01:16:30,109 --> 01:16:32,609
(The place where you can enjoy the newtro vibe properly)

2197
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:37,679
(Feeling the fanciness of Seongsu-dong's night streets,)

2198
01:16:37,979 --> 01:16:41,048
(they head over to the second DMR restaurant!)

2199
01:16:41,049 --> 01:16:44,148
I'm hungry. We moved around in cars nonstop.

2200
01:16:44,149 --> 01:16:45,819
- Why do we keep seeing new places? - I know.

2201
01:16:46,159 --> 01:16:48,158
Why are there so many things...

2202
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:50,458
in the nooks and crannies of Seongsu-dong?

2203
01:16:50,459 --> 01:16:53,358
Where is the pork galbi restaurant?

2204
01:16:53,359 --> 01:16:54,499
I'm so hungry.

2205
01:16:55,029 --> 01:16:56,768
- I'm craving pork galbi. - Yes.

2206
01:16:56,769 --> 01:16:58,569
Let's follow the smell.

2207
01:16:58,869 --> 01:16:59,869
Do you see it?

2208
01:16:59,999 --> 01:17:01,209
That's the restaurant. The original pork galbi restaurant.

2209
01:17:01,569 --> 01:17:02,768
(The sweet smell of mat draws them in.)

2210
01:17:02,769 --> 01:17:04,438
What's this? It's a pork galbi street.

2211
01:17:04,439 --> 01:17:06,778
It has the atmosphere of an old restaurant.

2212
01:17:06,779 --> 01:17:07,808
(They arrive at the second DMR restaurant!)

2213
01:17:07,809 --> 01:17:10,178
- I love the atmosphere. - I love old restaurants.

2214
01:17:10,179 --> 01:17:12,048
The signboard tells me that the food will be tasty.

2215
01:17:12,049 --> 01:17:13,178
It'll go down easily.

2216
01:17:13,179 --> 01:17:14,619
It's bound to be tasty.

2217
01:17:15,849 --> 01:17:17,318
(Under the worn roof...)

2218
01:17:17,319 --> 01:17:19,588
(lies a popular restaurant...)

2219
01:17:19,589 --> 01:17:21,859
(that's frequented by young customers too.)

2220
01:17:23,229 --> 01:17:27,399
(Their meat gets coated with the smoky aroma of briquettes.)

2221
01:17:29,929 --> 01:17:32,139
(The process makes the meat more tender and juicy.)

2222
01:17:32,769 --> 01:17:35,409
(The 1st-tier food on the briquette)

2223
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:39,739
(DMR 2, Pork galbi)

2224
01:17:40,039 --> 01:17:42,408
WOONG, have you been to a restaurant like this?

2225
01:17:42,409 --> 01:17:44,208
- I think this is my first time. - Right?

2226
01:17:44,209 --> 01:17:46,348
To be honest, I've only been...

2227
01:17:46,349 --> 01:17:48,548
to the main street we visited earlier.

2228
01:17:48,549 --> 01:17:50,718
- That's right. - I haven't been...

2229
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,218
to many old restaurants like this one.

2230
01:17:52,219 --> 01:17:53,459
It's like a grandma's house.

2231
01:17:53,759 --> 01:17:55,658
- Yes, that's exactly right. - It's like a grandma's house...

2232
01:17:55,659 --> 01:17:57,359
- with the yellow linoleum floor. - That's exactly right.

2233
01:17:58,029 --> 01:17:59,058
Here's the thing.

2234
01:17:59,059 --> 01:18:02,098
When I met WOONG for the 1st time. he was about 20 years old.

2235
01:18:02,099 --> 01:18:03,899
- Yes, I was 23. - That's right.

2236
01:18:04,329 --> 01:18:06,869
Since he was in his early 20s,

2237
01:18:06,899 --> 01:18:08,808
I didn't drink with him.

2238
01:18:08,809 --> 01:18:11,279
- He had to debut as an idol. - That's right.

2239
01:18:11,539 --> 01:18:13,438
It was like that. Let's drink today.

2240
01:18:13,439 --> 01:18:15,208
I'm in my sixth year.

2241
01:18:15,209 --> 01:18:16,809
I'll turn 30 next year.

2242
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:18,349
When did you become so old?

2243
01:18:19,079 --> 01:18:20,118
(He's like a son who has grown up too fast.)

2244
01:18:20,119 --> 01:18:21,819
- Seriously. - Have a drink.

2245
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:23,318
- Have a drink. - You should drink.

2246
01:18:23,319 --> 01:18:24,658
- Okay. - It's nice.

2247
01:18:24,659 --> 01:18:27,258
- It's the last restaurant. - Shall I go ahead and order?

2248
01:18:27,259 --> 01:18:28,328
- Okay. - Okay.

2249
01:18:28,329 --> 01:18:29,358
Sir.

2250
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:31,298
- My goodness. Hello. - Hello.

2251
01:18:31,299 --> 01:18:33,598
- Hello. - Hello.

2252
01:18:33,599 --> 01:18:35,228
Please come this way.

2253
01:18:35,229 --> 01:18:39,768
Would you tell us which style of pork galbi you sell?

2254
01:18:39,769 --> 01:18:42,268
- My restaurant is quite old. - Okay.

2255
01:18:42,269 --> 01:18:44,638
It's about 50 years.

2256
01:18:44,639 --> 01:18:45,938
- From your parents' generation... - Fifty years.

2257
01:18:45,939 --> 01:18:48,648
- Just in Seongsu-dong? - Yes. It has always been here.

2258
01:18:48,649 --> 01:18:50,478
- Really? - Yes. It has always been here.

2259
01:18:50,479 --> 01:18:51,649
- From your parents' generation? - Yes.

2260
01:18:52,119 --> 01:18:54,378
Wasn't this neighbourhood practically empty then?

2261
01:18:54,379 --> 01:18:55,918
That's right. It was empty.

2262
01:18:55,919 --> 01:18:57,588
Afterward, a racecourse got built.

2263
01:18:57,589 --> 01:18:59,088
- A racecourse? In Ttukseom? - Yes.

2264
01:18:59,089 --> 01:19:00,418
- The one in Gwacheon. - Yes.

2265
01:19:00,419 --> 01:19:03,389
A part of the Seoul Forest was a racecourse.

2266
01:19:03,459 --> 01:19:05,358
It got moved to Gwacheon.

2267
01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:07,058
- Back in the day? - Ttukseom Racecourse.

2268
01:19:07,059 --> 01:19:08,129
- Right? - Yes.

2269
01:19:09,299 --> 01:19:13,169
(Back in the day, the racecourse entertained the citizens.)

2270
01:19:13,939 --> 01:19:15,268
- Really? - Yes.

2271
01:19:15,269 --> 01:19:17,368
People who lost money came here because they were upset.

2272
01:19:17,369 --> 01:19:19,038
People who won money came here because they were happy.

2273
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,078
- Yes. - I see.

2274
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:23,448
Restaurants run for 50 years only when the food is very tasty.

2275
01:19:23,449 --> 01:19:24,818
That's right. It means the customers came back.

2276
01:19:24,819 --> 01:19:27,818
What's special about this restaurant?

2277
01:19:27,819 --> 01:19:28,989
- Something about the pork galbi. - Yes.

2278
01:19:29,719 --> 01:19:32,159
There's nothing special.

2279
01:19:32,519 --> 01:19:35,589
For 50 years, we've served food people didn't get tired of.

2280
01:19:36,129 --> 01:19:37,659
- It's the best. - It's the best.

2281
01:19:37,829 --> 01:19:39,059
Oldies but goodies.

2282
01:19:39,799 --> 01:19:41,668
The sauce is soy sauce blended with pears.

2283
01:19:41,669 --> 01:19:43,529
There weren't many ingredients 50 years ago.

2284
01:19:43,669 --> 01:19:45,098
So we kept to the basics.

2285
01:19:45,099 --> 01:19:46,568
We have pride in our food.

2286
01:19:46,569 --> 01:19:47,799
You're handsome.

2287
01:19:50,609 --> 01:19:51,678
(A sudden confession)

2288
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:53,239
(Confused)

2289
01:19:53,679 --> 01:19:55,549
- That was sudden. - I just saw his face.

2290
01:19:56,409 --> 01:19:58,319
I thought I was looking in the mirror.

2291
01:20:01,649 --> 01:20:03,089
He was working toward that comment.

2292
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:04,919
The mirror?

2293
01:20:05,219 --> 01:20:06,318
I became flustered for the first time in a while.

2294
01:20:06,319 --> 01:20:07,418
That's right.

2295
01:20:07,419 --> 01:20:09,228
I rarely become flustered.

2296
01:20:09,229 --> 01:20:11,028
I just saw his face.

2297
01:20:11,029 --> 01:20:12,098
Oh, my.

2298
01:20:12,099 --> 01:20:15,529
- Shall we order now? - Then why don't we order...

2299
01:20:16,099 --> 01:20:19,738
- six servings of pork galbi? - Okay.

2300
01:20:19,739 --> 01:20:21,068
- That's a good amount, right? - Yes.

2301
01:20:21,069 --> 01:20:22,768
Please give us beef tartare as well.

2302
01:20:22,769 --> 01:20:25,008
Please also give us kimchi stew, doenjang stew, and mul naengmyeon.

2303
01:20:25,009 --> 01:20:27,178
- That'll be our order. - Okay.

2304
01:20:27,179 --> 01:20:28,849
- Thank you. - All right.

2305
01:20:29,549 --> 01:20:31,308
It's incredible that he can proudly say,

2306
01:20:31,309 --> 01:20:33,949
"For 50 years, we've served food people didn't get tired of."

2307
01:20:34,049 --> 01:20:36,218
- It's here. - Beef tartare looks amazing.

2308
01:20:36,219 --> 01:20:37,689
It's the handsome beef tartare.

2309
01:20:37,989 --> 01:20:39,518
Shall I put it here?

2310
01:20:39,519 --> 01:20:40,558
The handsome beef tartare.

2311
01:20:40,559 --> 01:20:41,559
(Beef tartare will stimulate their appetite before the meal.)

2312
01:20:41,989 --> 01:20:44,388
(An ingredient that harmonizes perfectly with the sweet pear,)

2313
01:20:44,389 --> 01:20:46,429
(Korean beef)

2314
01:20:46,899 --> 01:20:48,799
(It competes with its sweet and salty charms.)

2315
01:20:49,269 --> 01:20:52,669
(Shall we stimulate our appetite with the Korean beef tartare?)

2316
01:20:52,739 --> 01:20:56,009
- Let's eat. - Thank you for the food.

2317
01:20:56,639 --> 01:20:59,179
It's the traditional beef tartare that competes with taste alone.

2318
01:20:59,579 --> 01:21:02,478
That's the beef tartare we're used to.

2319
01:21:02,479 --> 01:21:03,778
The traditional one.

2320
01:21:03,779 --> 01:21:05,819
The seasoning isn't excessive.

2321
01:21:06,349 --> 01:21:07,419
The taste is simple.

2322
01:21:07,979 --> 01:21:09,889
You won't get tired of it.

2323
01:21:11,789 --> 01:21:14,389
- WOONG, go ahead and eat. - Okay. Thank you for the food.

2324
01:21:14,659 --> 01:21:15,659
It's nice.

2325
01:21:15,908 --> 01:21:17,677
- Traditional beef tartare. - Traditional beef tartare.

2326
01:21:17,702 --> 01:21:18,702
Traditional beef tartare.

2327
01:21:20,025 --> 01:21:21,694
- Traditional beef tartare. - Beef.

2328
01:21:21,829 --> 01:21:23,898
- It's sweet. - It stimulates my appetite.

2329
01:21:23,899 --> 01:21:25,368
Is there some sweetness?

2330
01:21:25,369 --> 01:21:26,968
- It's the taste of pears. - Yes, it's sweet.

2331
01:21:26,969 --> 01:21:28,539
Thanks to the sauce that contains pears,

2332
01:21:29,339 --> 01:21:31,269
it's salty and sweet.

2333
01:21:31,309 --> 01:21:32,339
It's traditional beef tartare.

2334
01:21:33,109 --> 01:21:34,138
(It looks tasty.)

2335
01:21:34,139 --> 01:21:35,278
It's a classic and basic dish.

2336
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:37,008
- If I eat rice with it, - Will it go well with rice?

2337
01:21:37,009 --> 01:21:38,048
I'll finish about three bowls.

2338
01:21:38,049 --> 01:21:40,119
You could eat it with rice as a side dish.

2339
01:21:40,749 --> 01:21:42,418
(The long-awaited main dish finally appears.)

2340
01:21:42,419 --> 01:21:44,589
- It's the briquette fire. - There are briquettes.

2341
01:21:44,819 --> 01:21:46,158
That's right.

2342
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:47,318
They're somewhat cooked.

2343
01:21:47,319 --> 01:21:48,759
(The hot briquettes)

2344
01:21:49,059 --> 01:21:50,059
Thank you.

2345
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:51,999
Give one here. I'll grill the meat.

2346
01:21:52,429 --> 01:21:54,029
(The briquettes are loaded.)

2347
01:21:54,729 --> 01:21:57,029
(The ribs get grilled outside as soon as they're ordered.)

2348
01:21:59,699 --> 01:22:02,139
(As the meat soaks up the smoky aroma,)

2349
01:22:02,569 --> 01:22:04,879
(grill it so that it's crispy outside and moist inside.)

2350
01:22:05,139 --> 01:22:07,278
(The partial grilling is complete.)

2351
01:22:07,279 --> 01:22:08,608
- Shall I put them on the grill? - Yes.

2352
01:22:08,609 --> 01:22:10,248
- It's half-cooked. - Do it right away.

2353
01:22:10,249 --> 01:22:12,079
(The half-cooked pork galbi goes on the grill.)

2354
01:22:12,279 --> 01:22:14,818
From what I can see,

2355
01:22:14,819 --> 01:22:17,118
- the seasoning isn't too strong. - It hasn't been seasoning much.

2356
01:22:17,119 --> 01:22:18,619
- You're right. - It won't be too salty. I love it.

2357
01:22:19,059 --> 01:22:22,128
It almost looks like dakgalbi.

2358
01:22:22,129 --> 01:22:23,558
- You're right. - It looks like dakgalbi.

2359
01:22:23,559 --> 01:22:26,599
- It looks like dakgalbi. - It's like grilling chicken.

2360
01:22:29,099 --> 01:22:30,798
May I try a piece of meat?

2361
01:22:30,799 --> 01:22:31,799
- Already? - Already?

2362
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:33,668
- There's a cooked piece. - No.

2363
01:22:33,669 --> 01:22:35,338
I'll show you.

2364
01:22:35,339 --> 01:22:37,168
This piece is cooked. It's thin.

2365
01:22:37,169 --> 01:22:38,939
Do you take anthelmintics every year?

2366
01:22:39,039 --> 01:22:40,709
I melt everything with my gastric acid.

2367
01:22:41,709 --> 01:22:43,779
- It's cooked. - This piece is cooked.

2368
01:22:44,049 --> 01:22:45,249
It won't be good if you eat too fast.

2369
01:22:45,519 --> 01:22:46,918
- It's cooked. - Is it cooked?

2370
01:22:46,919 --> 01:22:47,949
It's cooked.

2371
01:22:47,979 --> 01:22:49,248
It's totally cooked.

2372
01:22:49,249 --> 01:22:50,718
- Really? - Rhymer..

2373
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:51,719
How is it?

2374
01:22:52,459 --> 01:22:53,988
- How is it? What's different? - It's cooked.

2375
01:22:53,989 --> 01:22:56,328
- Rhymer, have you tried it? - I want to try this piece.

2376
01:22:56,329 --> 01:22:57,729
Try it.

2377
01:22:58,429 --> 01:23:00,198
I don't know if I judged it correctly.

2378
01:23:00,199 --> 01:23:01,359
- It isn't cooked yet. - Why?

2379
01:23:02,029 --> 01:23:03,298
Is it the taste of pear?

2380
01:23:03,299 --> 01:23:07,439
It isn't the taste of pork galbi we usually have.

2381
01:23:08,539 --> 01:23:09,569
Is it more refreshing?

2382
01:23:10,169 --> 01:23:13,008
The taste makes me understand why people ate it for 50 years.

2383
01:23:13,009 --> 01:23:14,438
- Really? - How is it different?

2384
01:23:14,439 --> 01:23:15,479
What?

2385
01:23:15,609 --> 01:23:18,219
- I'm curious. - You'll know once you try it.

2386
01:23:18,919 --> 01:23:20,148
Is there no sauce?

2387
01:23:20,149 --> 01:23:21,549
Eat it as it is and enjoy the original taste.

2388
01:23:24,749 --> 01:23:26,089
- It's nice. - Right?

2389
01:23:26,389 --> 01:23:28,659
- WOONG, try it. - Okay.

2390
01:23:29,259 --> 01:23:30,328
(WOONG also tries a piece of nicely-cooked galbi.)

2391
01:23:30,329 --> 01:23:31,489
- Try it. - Okay.

2392
01:23:33,929 --> 01:23:34,998
- It's nice, right? - Yes.

2393
01:23:34,999 --> 01:23:37,468
It isn't the taste we're used to.

2394
01:23:37,469 --> 01:23:39,498
It isn't the taste of seasoned galbi, right?

2395
01:23:39,499 --> 01:23:42,408
It's somewhere between seasoned and unseasoned.

2396
01:23:42,409 --> 01:23:43,469
The taste is clean.

2397
01:23:43,909 --> 01:23:46,138
It'll be good with rice.

2398
01:23:46,139 --> 01:23:48,649
But even if you eat it as it is, it won't be salty. It's perfect.

2399
01:23:49,479 --> 01:23:51,948
- Go ahead and eat. Eat up. - Thank you.

2400
01:23:51,949 --> 01:23:53,419
(They begin the eating show in their own speed.)

2401
01:23:55,649 --> 01:23:56,649
Here.

2402
01:23:57,319 --> 01:23:59,059
People eat it with rice.

2403
01:24:00,019 --> 01:24:02,559
(They eat in a combative manner.)

2404
01:24:03,429 --> 01:24:04,629
He's wrapping it with noodles.

2405
01:24:04,729 --> 01:24:05,798
That's the real deal.

2406
01:24:05,799 --> 01:24:07,858
The noodles are cold and the meat is warm.

2407
01:24:07,859 --> 01:24:09,099
It's naengmyeon with meat.

2408
01:24:09,799 --> 01:24:11,269
It's salty. It's nice.

2409
01:24:11,599 --> 01:24:13,599
I bet the naengmyeon is icy.

2410
01:24:13,739 --> 01:24:15,639
- It's tasty. - This is...

2411
01:24:16,509 --> 01:24:18,069
It's so tasty.

2412
01:24:19,639 --> 01:24:20,739
It looks tasty.

2413
01:24:21,649 --> 01:24:24,449
I'm glad I chose this menu. Seriously.

2414
01:24:24,649 --> 01:24:26,478
- It's so tasty. It's my cup of tea. - I mean, it's almost...

2415
01:24:26,479 --> 01:24:27,649
(The pork galbi suits Rhymer's taste!)

2416
01:24:27,779 --> 01:24:28,989
We're getting a stew.

2417
01:24:30,619 --> 01:24:31,658
My goodness.

2418
01:24:31,659 --> 01:24:34,059
(A stew enters.)

2419
01:24:34,189 --> 01:24:35,929
Gosh, this kimchi stew is the real deal.

2420
01:24:37,189 --> 01:24:38,189
Here is rice.

2421
01:24:38,259 --> 01:24:39,958
- The kimchi stew looks incredible. - What's up with it?

2422
01:24:39,959 --> 01:24:41,769
The kimchi stew looks incredible. It's like a braised dish.

2423
01:24:43,599 --> 01:24:46,399
(The spicy soup will offset the sweet taste of galbi.)

2424
01:24:46,769 --> 01:24:50,339
(This sight will make any Korean drool.)

2425
01:24:50,539 --> 01:24:52,409
It's bound to be tasty.

2426
01:24:53,639 --> 01:24:55,409
- The kimchi stew looks incredible. - It smells good.

2427
01:24:56,749 --> 01:24:58,749
The kimchi stew looks incredible. It's delicious even to the eyes.

2428
01:24:59,449 --> 01:25:00,578
Some restaurants make you dip it in a sauce.

2429
01:25:00,579 --> 01:25:02,718
- But this galbi doesn't need it. - No.

2430
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:03,889
Gosh, what a kimchi stew!

2431
01:25:05,389 --> 01:25:07,159
(He can't take his eyes off of the kimchi stew.)

2432
01:25:11,629 --> 01:25:12,629
I mean...

2433
01:25:15,369 --> 01:25:17,869
The taste is insane.

2434
01:25:18,069 --> 01:25:19,969
The aged kimchi tastes amazing.

2435
01:25:20,899 --> 01:25:22,139
What I lift up the kimchi,

2436
01:25:22,409 --> 01:25:24,168
it rips at the slightest touch.

2437
01:25:24,169 --> 01:25:25,939
- I know what you mean. - That's how soft it is.

2438
01:25:26,309 --> 01:25:28,408
It's a bit translucent.

2439
01:25:28,409 --> 01:25:30,308
It makes the mouth water as soon as it enters.

2440
01:25:30,309 --> 01:25:33,079
- It's sour and savoury. - This restaurant...

2441
01:25:33,219 --> 01:25:34,778
The texture is soft.

2442
01:25:34,779 --> 01:25:36,949
- It rivals a kimchi stew place. - Totally.

2443
01:25:37,719 --> 01:25:40,118
Kimchi stew is tasty when it's a bit rich.

2444
01:25:40,119 --> 01:25:41,889
- I agree. Seriously. - The taste shouldn't be light.

2445
01:25:42,589 --> 01:25:45,728
(He doesn't pay attention to his singer's words.)

2446
01:25:45,729 --> 01:25:46,799
The taste shouldn't be light.

2447
01:25:46,859 --> 01:25:47,929
Is it that tasty?

2448
01:25:48,669 --> 01:25:49,998
(Laughing)

2449
01:25:49,999 --> 01:25:52,298
- Hey, Rhymer. - Why are you so excited?

2450
01:25:52,299 --> 01:25:54,368
I guess it's that tasty.

2451
01:25:54,369 --> 01:25:55,439
(The CEO who embarrasses other people.)

2452
01:25:56,139 --> 01:25:59,579
His singer is right next to him, but he's...

2453
01:26:00,409 --> 01:26:02,649
He's eating like a servant.

2454
01:26:03,249 --> 01:26:06,049
Right now, WOONG looks like the CEO.

2455
01:26:06,319 --> 01:26:08,749
I'm so happy right now.

2456
01:26:09,749 --> 01:26:10,988
What's this?

2457
01:26:10,989 --> 01:26:13,618
I don't care about the shoot.

2458
01:26:13,619 --> 01:26:14,658
For goodness' sake.

2459
01:26:14,659 --> 01:26:16,489
- CEO. - It's nice!

2460
01:26:17,359 --> 01:26:18,859
Please say, "Hey."

2461
01:26:19,459 --> 01:26:22,229
- Hey! - Ho!

2462
01:26:23,899 --> 01:26:25,799
Doesn't this feel like Brand New Music's team dinner?

2463
01:26:27,399 --> 01:26:30,439
- WOONG, since you ate this... - Okay.

2464
01:26:30,939 --> 01:26:32,409
You do this whenever you drink.

2465
01:26:33,909 --> 01:26:35,449
You do this whenever you drink.

2466
01:26:35,949 --> 01:26:39,219
I will work really hard this year.

2467
01:26:39,319 --> 01:26:41,179
Expect good things to come, WOONG.

2468
01:26:41,449 --> 01:26:43,788
Just stay healthy to perform as a singer.

2469
01:26:43,789 --> 01:26:44,789
Thank you.

2470
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:47,419
I will make sure to return this favour back to you.

2471
01:26:48,359 --> 01:26:49,588
- I'm serious. - I should be the one...

2472
01:26:49,589 --> 01:26:50,589
to pay back to you.

2473
01:26:50,834 --> 01:26:51,904
Thank you.

2474
01:26:51,929 --> 01:26:53,859
- It's so heartwarming. - It's so heartwarming.

2475
01:26:54,559 --> 01:26:57,029
(Watching with sweet eyes)

2476
01:26:58,369 --> 01:26:59,738
(The heartwarming time ends quickly.)

2477
01:26:59,739 --> 01:27:00,769
Gosh.

2478
01:27:01,039 --> 01:27:03,238
My heart feels so warm.

2479
01:27:03,239 --> 01:27:04,309
Gosh, I'm sorry.

2480
01:27:04,369 --> 01:27:06,609
This show makes my heart feel so warm.

2481
01:27:06,779 --> 01:27:09,308
If he has around three more glasses,

2482
01:27:09,309 --> 01:27:12,019
he'll say, "Everything is on me."

2483
01:27:12,549 --> 01:27:13,549
Right!

2484
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:15,819
(Too much drinking of alcohol is bad for your health.)

2485
01:27:16,019 --> 01:27:17,249
Rhymer is going to pay again.

2486
01:27:17,419 --> 01:27:19,189
- He's going to pay again. - Get him more drinks!

2487
01:27:21,059 --> 01:27:23,528
Give us our freeloading chance too.

2488
01:27:23,529 --> 01:27:25,228
- I just remembered about it. - They don't want to.

2489
01:27:25,229 --> 01:27:27,328
There's not enough meat for us.

2490
01:27:27,329 --> 01:27:28,669
Let us do the quiz.

2491
01:27:28,829 --> 01:27:30,769
Right. Sang Uk really wants some.

2492
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:33,469
Gosh, the kimchi is amazing.

2493
01:27:33,799 --> 01:27:35,338
He's really enjoying the food.

2494
01:27:35,339 --> 01:27:36,509
(Eating)

2495
01:27:37,469 --> 01:27:38,679
When he's on the other team,

2496
01:27:38,979 --> 01:27:40,578
your blood pressure will shoot up.

2497
01:27:40,579 --> 01:27:41,978
(Your blood pressure will shoot up.)

2498
01:27:41,979 --> 01:27:43,478
- Should I teach you how to eat it? - Yes.

2499
01:27:43,479 --> 01:27:44,479
- Get your food... - Right.

2500
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:46,119
and look to that side as you eat. It will feel great.

2501
01:27:47,519 --> 01:27:50,089
- Show him how it's done. - Look to that side.

2502
01:27:51,649 --> 01:27:52,688
(Putting in)

2503
01:27:52,689 --> 01:27:54,219
- That's great. - That's great.

2504
01:27:54,359 --> 01:27:55,428
- That's great. - Gosh.

2505
01:27:55,429 --> 01:27:56,559
That's great from you.

2506
01:27:57,829 --> 01:27:59,899
Should we really start with our quiz?

2507
01:28:00,529 --> 01:28:03,929
But it'll be hard to fully grasp its taste with just one piece.

2508
01:28:04,299 --> 01:28:06,838
You fall into it the more you have it.

2509
01:28:06,839 --> 01:28:07,839
You want more.

2510
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,669
That is why it might be better not to have any.

2511
01:28:09,869 --> 01:28:11,469
- What? - Rather than just trying one.

2512
01:28:12,109 --> 01:28:13,638
So one person will eat until the end?

2513
01:28:13,639 --> 01:28:14,678
Until the end?

2514
01:28:14,679 --> 01:28:16,978
This whole portion will be shared with me and the winner.

2515
01:28:16,979 --> 01:28:18,079
Okay.

2516
01:28:18,479 --> 01:28:20,448
But it has to be just one person. No one else is allowed.

2517
01:28:20,449 --> 01:28:21,548
No one else is allowed.

2518
01:28:21,549 --> 01:28:22,619
- Okay. - Okay.

2519
01:28:23,019 --> 01:28:25,288
Is it for a free ticket for this portion?

2520
01:28:25,289 --> 01:28:26,659
- Yes. - Sounds good.

2521
01:28:27,519 --> 01:28:28,988
To match today's theme,

2522
01:28:28,989 --> 01:28:31,629
I will give you a famous quote quiz.

2523
01:28:32,599 --> 01:28:34,799
This is a famous quote said by Abraham Lincoln.

2524
01:28:35,529 --> 01:28:36,768
- Lincoln. - Lincoln.

2525
01:28:36,769 --> 01:28:38,698
(Lincoln)

2526
01:28:38,699 --> 01:28:41,199
"This is stronger than the bullet."

2527
01:28:42,309 --> 01:28:44,339
I know this one. I really do.

2528
01:28:44,739 --> 01:28:45,779
I got it.

2529
01:28:46,409 --> 01:28:47,578
- The pen? - The pen?

2530
01:28:47,579 --> 01:28:48,948
(Answer: Pen)

2531
01:28:48,949 --> 01:28:50,609
- That is incorrect. - That comes to mind first.

2532
01:28:51,309 --> 01:28:52,949
- I got it. Words. - Words?

2533
01:28:53,379 --> 01:28:54,419
That is incorrect.

2534
01:28:54,449 --> 01:28:56,688
That's incorrect? I thought it was words.

2535
01:28:56,689 --> 01:28:57,477
I got it. Money.

2536
01:28:58,149 --> 01:28:58,984
That is incorrect.

2537
01:29:00,019 --> 01:29:01,389
This is harder than I thought.

2538
01:29:01,889 --> 01:29:03,788
- Bullets can kill people. - I got it. The public sentiment.

2539
01:29:03,789 --> 01:29:05,328
(Answer: Public sentiment)

2540
01:29:05,329 --> 01:29:07,258
- Is it around those lines? - That is incorrect.

2541
01:29:07,259 --> 01:29:08,259
It must be similar.

2542
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:09,769
- This can bring someone down. - I got it.

2543
01:29:10,029 --> 01:29:10,953
Heart of the voter.

2544
01:29:11,999 --> 01:29:13,768
- That must be it. - Isn't it the heart of the voter?

2545
01:29:13,769 --> 01:29:14,969
That word is incorrect.

2546
01:29:15,339 --> 01:29:17,108
There's a similar word.

2547
01:29:17,109 --> 01:29:18,469
I got it. The ballot.

2548
01:29:18,709 --> 01:29:20,039
The ballot is correct.

2549
01:29:20,479 --> 01:29:21,739
It's not the heart of the voter?

2550
01:29:22,949 --> 01:29:24,279
- My gosh. - Are you serious?

2551
01:29:25,279 --> 01:29:27,249
- Gosh. - Sang Uk must have wanted some.

2552
01:29:27,679 --> 01:29:29,188
- Gosh, it looks so good. - Oh, no.

2553
01:29:29,189 --> 01:29:30,589
I should come here separately.

2554
01:29:31,089 --> 01:29:33,688
These guys didn't have any of the lettuce.

2555
01:29:33,689 --> 01:29:36,289
They didn't even touch the ssamjang!

2556
01:29:36,459 --> 01:29:37,829
- Even the pickled radish wrap. - My gosh.

2557
01:29:38,129 --> 01:29:40,158
You guys might die eating like this!

2558
01:29:40,159 --> 01:29:41,428
The pickled radish wrap has dried up.

2559
01:29:41,429 --> 01:29:42,898
How are you guys going to survive?

2560
01:29:42,899 --> 01:29:44,369
- Gosh. - They just went for the meat.

2561
01:29:44,529 --> 01:29:45,639
There's a reason why.

2562
01:29:46,339 --> 01:29:48,438
It was seasoned well enough...

2563
01:29:48,439 --> 01:29:49,568
that it didn't need any ssamjang with it.

2564
01:29:49,569 --> 01:29:50,668
- Right. - That must be why.

2565
01:29:50,669 --> 01:29:52,809
- But it does taste different. - Right.

2566
01:29:52,879 --> 01:29:54,779
I thought it was going to taste obvious.

2567
01:29:55,079 --> 01:29:56,649
- It tastes... - It doesn't taste obvious.

2568
01:29:56,809 --> 01:29:58,678
You have to try it as is.

2569
01:29:58,679 --> 01:29:59,749
It doesn't taste sweet.

2570
01:30:00,679 --> 01:30:01,848
It tastes better the more you have it.

2571
01:30:01,849 --> 01:30:03,118
- Your stomach has become bigger. - Right.

2572
01:30:03,119 --> 01:30:05,249
Your stomach has become bigger. You can eat a lot now.

2573
01:30:05,959 --> 01:30:07,158
It tastes better the more you have it.

2574
01:30:07,159 --> 01:30:09,129
You understand how it tastes bland, right?

2575
01:30:09,929 --> 01:30:11,389
It tastes just right at one point.

2576
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:13,629
- The sweetness comes up. - Right.

2577
01:30:15,029 --> 01:30:18,029
(He's focused on his rib no matter what the others are doing.)

2578
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:22,038
(Chewing)

2579
01:30:22,039 --> 01:30:23,138
- He's really enjoying it. - I'm sitting...

2580
01:30:23,139 --> 01:30:24,668
right in front of Tae Hyun...

2581
01:30:24,669 --> 01:30:26,039
and it feels like I'm watching a home shopping channel.

2582
01:30:26,709 --> 01:30:27,938
(Handsome Guys Home Shopping)

2583
01:30:27,939 --> 01:30:29,148
(First reveal on home shopping!)

2584
01:30:29,149 --> 01:30:30,508
- Did you order some? - It's the performance...

2585
01:30:30,509 --> 01:30:31,509
right before it's sold out.

2586
01:30:31,510 --> 01:30:32,718
(Sell out imminent!)

2587
01:30:32,719 --> 01:30:34,578
- He's enjoying it. - I've never seen him eat...

2588
01:30:34,579 --> 01:30:36,149
while getting his hands dirty like this.

2589
01:30:37,149 --> 01:30:39,088
- The rib must be so good. - He's really enjoying it.

2590
01:30:39,089 --> 01:30:40,588
- He had the burger too. - I should go for that part too.

2591
01:30:40,589 --> 01:30:42,689
It's right to tear the meat off the bones.

2592
01:30:43,029 --> 01:30:44,229
This is so good.

2593
01:30:45,399 --> 01:30:46,929
Isn't he brushing his teeth right now?

2594
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:49,228
(Brushing)

2595
01:30:49,229 --> 01:30:50,428
- Gosh, Tae Hyun. - What was that?

2596
01:30:50,429 --> 01:30:51,999
You might end up putting that in your pocket.

2597
01:30:52,239 --> 01:30:54,439
Why are you eating the meat like that?

2598
01:30:54,939 --> 01:30:56,709
- Gosh. - This is so good.

2599
01:30:57,369 --> 01:30:58,409
Gosh.

2600
01:30:59,439 --> 01:31:00,908
- It's long. - Gosh, it looks nice.

2601
01:31:00,909 --> 01:31:02,778
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz has returned.)

2602
01:31:02,779 --> 01:31:04,749
- This is... - It's 220 dollars.

2603
01:31:04,909 --> 01:31:06,318
- It's 220 dollars? - It's 220 dollars.

2604
01:31:06,319 --> 01:31:07,718
- It's less than 300 dollars? - It's 220 dollars?

2605
01:31:07,719 --> 01:31:09,318
Four people had this much with drinks.

2606
01:31:09,319 --> 01:31:10,989
We had two bowls of beef tartare too.

2607
01:31:11,189 --> 01:31:12,258
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

2608
01:31:12,259 --> 01:31:13,358
(BRANDNEW MUSIC's card)

2609
01:31:13,359 --> 01:31:14,788
- All right. Give us the quiz. - Okay.

2610
01:31:14,789 --> 01:31:16,189
Here's today's last quiz.

2611
01:31:16,559 --> 01:31:18,658
From old times, pig dreams...

2612
01:31:18,659 --> 01:31:20,928
represented wealth and good luck.

2613
01:31:20,929 --> 01:31:22,299
- Pig dreams? - Yes.

2614
01:31:23,299 --> 01:31:24,698
But having just a pig appear in your dream...

2615
01:31:24,699 --> 01:31:26,439
didn't mean it was always a lucky dream.

2616
01:31:27,199 --> 01:31:28,439
Out of the following choices,

2617
01:31:29,739 --> 01:31:33,208
which dream is considered to be a lucky dream?

2618
01:31:33,209 --> 01:31:34,209
It's a multiple choice question.
- That's nice. - That's nice.

2619
01:31:35,209 --> 01:31:36,209
- It'll be easy. - Hold on.

2620
01:31:36,210 --> 01:31:38,109
I'm really interested in dreams and fortune telling.

2621
01:31:38,379 --> 01:31:39,819
I'm really interested in getting dreams interpreted.

2622
01:31:39,949 --> 01:31:41,648
- Trust me on this once. - Okay.

2623
01:31:41,649 --> 01:31:43,148
We're all set. We have an expert on this.

2624
01:31:43,149 --> 01:31:44,589
I'm almost an expert on this.

2625
01:31:45,219 --> 01:31:46,419
- Here are the choices. - Right.

2626
01:31:47,089 --> 01:31:48,089
Number one,

2627
01:31:48,459 --> 01:31:52,029
a dream of grilling a whole pig and eating the sliced meat.

2628
01:31:52,359 --> 01:31:53,929
- We have to find the lucky dream. - Right.

2629
01:31:54,759 --> 01:31:55,769
Number two,

2630
01:31:55,869 --> 01:31:58,269
a dream of chasing after a pig running away.

2631
01:31:59,069 --> 01:32:00,799
It doesn't seem like this one, right?

2632
01:32:01,099 --> 01:32:02,139
Number three,

2633
01:32:02,239 --> 01:32:04,269
a dream of two pigs fighting against each other.

2634
01:32:04,739 --> 01:32:06,009
This one feels right too.

2635
01:32:06,545 --> 01:32:07,183
Number four,

2636
01:32:07,739 --> 01:32:10,648
a dream of a pig that must be fought against becoming a person.

2637
01:32:10,649 --> 01:32:12,008
(Out of the following choices,)

2638
01:32:12,009 --> 01:32:13,348
(which dream is considered to be a lucky dream?)

2639
01:32:13,349 --> 01:32:14,749
- This is hard. - Which one is it?

2640
01:32:15,349 --> 01:32:16,888
Don't you think eating the pig...

2641
01:32:16,889 --> 01:32:21,119
represents bringing in luck into your body?

2642
01:32:21,359 --> 01:32:24,088
My wife has a lot of dreams like the first one.

2643
01:32:24,089 --> 01:32:25,898
- Really? - She chews while she's asleep.

2644
01:32:25,899 --> 01:32:27,859
That means...

2645
01:32:28,059 --> 01:32:29,968
She might be actually eating something.

2646
01:32:29,969 --> 01:32:31,528
That happens often when people go on a diet.

2647
01:32:31,529 --> 01:32:32,968
- That is why... - I've seen her do that often.

2648
01:32:32,969 --> 01:32:34,638
that dream feels like it's meaningless.

2649
01:32:34,639 --> 01:32:36,039
I think...

2650
01:32:37,109 --> 01:32:39,309
a pig becoming a person represents a lucky dream.

2651
01:32:39,679 --> 01:32:40,808
A pig becoming a person?

2652
01:32:40,809 --> 01:32:43,449
I feel like that one is surely a lucky dream.

2653
01:32:44,395 --> 01:32:47,435
- It feels like that represents... - Really?

2654
01:32:47,549 --> 01:32:48,849
- good luck. - You all think so?

2655
01:32:49,019 --> 01:32:50,089
- I think the same way too. - Right.

2656
01:32:50,119 --> 01:32:52,658
It is said that dreams represent the opposite of what will happen.

2657
01:32:52,659 --> 01:32:55,088
- The one with pigs fighting... - That sounds reasonable.

2658
01:32:55,089 --> 01:32:57,288
- sounds like a good shout too. - I think it's number 1 or 3.

2659
01:32:57,289 --> 01:32:58,998
I think I've seen this somewhere.

2660
01:32:58,999 --> 01:33:01,698
I remember being told that...

2661
01:33:01,699 --> 01:33:04,799
pigs being all over each other represented a good dream.

2662
01:33:05,129 --> 01:33:06,838
I remember having a similar dream.

2663
01:33:06,839 --> 01:33:08,439
I don't remember if they were pigs.

2664
01:33:08,869 --> 01:33:11,168
I remember becoming successful...

2665
01:33:11,169 --> 01:33:13,838
after having a crazy dream with a lot of fighting.

2666
01:33:13,839 --> 01:33:14,839
Then go with that one.

2667
01:33:14,840 --> 01:33:16,008
It will be amazing if you get it right with your experience.

2668
01:33:16,009 --> 01:33:17,009
- I'm serious. - Go with that one.

2669
01:33:17,010 --> 01:33:18,748
I don't remember if they were pigs.

2670
01:33:18,749 --> 01:33:20,878
It was so chaotic and crazy...

2671
01:33:20,879 --> 01:33:22,519
that I went, "What do I do?"

2672
01:33:22,649 --> 01:33:24,048
- But things went well. - The albums...

2673
01:33:24,049 --> 01:33:25,148
released during that time did really well.

2674
01:33:25,149 --> 01:33:26,259
This is what I think.

2675
01:33:26,359 --> 01:33:27,458
If you had that experience,

2676
01:33:27,459 --> 01:33:28,488
it's right for us to go with number three.

2677
01:33:28,489 --> 01:33:29,529
Right.

2678
01:33:29,629 --> 01:33:30,829
- Okay. - We got it.

2679
01:33:32,089 --> 01:33:33,158
Number three,

2680
01:33:33,159 --> 01:33:34,229
a dream of two pigs fighting against each other.

2681
01:33:35,529 --> 01:33:38,029
(Will that be the right answer?)

2682
01:33:38,729 --> 01:33:39,768
According to...

2683
01:33:39,769 --> 01:33:40,838
the "Encyclopedia of Dream Interpretation..."

2684
01:33:40,839 --> 01:33:42,038
(Answer: A dream of two pigs fighting against each other)

2685
01:33:42,039 --> 01:33:44,139
A dream of two pigs fighting against each other...

2686
01:33:45,139 --> 01:33:46,979
represents the possibility...

2687
01:33:48,039 --> 01:33:50,978
of a business or relationship falling into conflict.

2688
01:33:50,979 --> 01:33:52,418
(Team Pork Galbi is incorrect!)

2689
01:33:52,419 --> 01:33:53,549
- Incorrect! - Then...

2690
01:33:54,272 --> 01:33:55,742
you all must choose an answer.

2691
01:33:55,889 --> 01:33:57,318
- Choose? - I'll go with the choice...

2692
01:33:57,319 --> 01:33:58,319
that's left.

2693
01:33:59,005 --> 01:33:59,984
- You should go first. - Right.

2694
01:34:00,419 --> 01:34:01,888
- You should choose, sir. - That was...

2695
01:34:01,889 --> 01:34:03,259
- the second one? - I'll follow your decision.

2696
01:34:03,530 --> 01:34:04,359
You should choose, WOONG.

2697
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:07,729
I really can't trust myself now.

2698
01:34:08,029 --> 01:34:09,598
I got this one wrong again.

2699
01:34:09,599 --> 01:34:11,069
Then I'll go with number two.

2700
01:34:12,099 --> 01:34:13,298
A dream of chasing after a pig running away?

2701
01:34:13,299 --> 01:34:14,468
- Are you sure? - Isn't it better to have...

2702
01:34:14,469 --> 01:34:15,908
the luck right in front of you?

2703
01:34:15,909 --> 01:34:18,208
I think it's either number 1 or number 4.

2704
01:34:18,209 --> 01:34:19,909
You said you were going to trust him.

2705
01:34:20,139 --> 01:34:22,779
- He suddenly changed his mind. - Right.

2706
01:34:22,849 --> 01:34:23,849
Number two.

2707
01:34:23,850 --> 01:34:26,418
- What about you, Dong Hyun? - I'll go with number four.

2708
01:34:26,419 --> 01:34:28,048
That was the answer we were going to go with.

2709
01:34:28,049 --> 01:34:29,288
- Which one is left then? - Number one.

2710
01:34:29,289 --> 01:34:30,719
- Number 1. - Number 1.

2711
01:34:31,089 --> 01:34:32,118
- Number 1. - Seung Ho goes with number 1.

2712
01:34:32,119 --> 01:34:33,158
I go with number four.

2713
01:34:33,159 --> 01:34:35,058
We go with number 2 and he goes with number 4.

2714
01:34:35,059 --> 01:34:36,729
The person that gets it right gets exempted.

2715
01:34:36,929 --> 01:34:38,789
- That person gets exempted. - I hope it's number two.

2716
01:34:39,399 --> 01:34:41,058
- What's the answer? - The answer is...

2717
01:34:41,059 --> 01:34:42,099
(What's the answer?)

2718
01:34:42,699 --> 01:34:43,699
number one,

2719
01:34:43,700 --> 01:34:45,298
a dream of grilling a whole pig and eating the sliced meat.

2720
01:34:45,299 --> 01:34:46,599
(A dream of grilling a whole pig and eating the sliced meat)

2721
01:34:46,839 --> 01:34:48,439
- Seung Ho strikes again! - Seung Ho strikes again!

2722
01:34:49,539 --> 01:34:51,808
- It was number one. - Gosh.

2723
01:34:51,809 --> 01:34:53,209
So it was number one.

2724
01:34:54,209 --> 01:34:56,379
I'm always getting that feeling.

2725
01:34:58,599 --> 01:35:00,299
You can't ignore Dong Hyun's spirit.

2726
01:35:00,579 --> 01:35:02,179
It's BRANDNEW MUSIC against the Stun Gun.

2727
01:35:02,689 --> 01:35:03,788
It's BRANDNEW MUSIC against the Stun Gun.

2728
01:35:03,789 --> 01:35:04,848
Right.

2729
01:35:04,849 --> 01:35:05,958
(Will the Stun Gun win?)

2730
01:35:05,959 --> 01:35:06,959
BRANDNEW MUSIC.

2731
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:08,889
This is the final question.

2732
01:35:08,929 --> 01:35:09,999
- Right. - Gosh.

2733
01:35:10,559 --> 01:35:12,628
Why are you placing my card?

2734
01:35:12,629 --> 01:35:13,928
Why place my card?

2735
01:35:13,929 --> 01:35:15,559
I'm sensitive about these things.

2736
01:35:16,169 --> 01:35:18,528
- You'll end up paying right away. - Right.

2737
01:35:18,529 --> 01:35:19,769
- We have to call for it. - Right.

2738
01:35:20,299 --> 01:35:23,068
The representative ingredient for making the pork galbi sauce...

2739
01:35:23,069 --> 01:35:24,209
is soy sauce.

2740
01:35:25,539 --> 01:35:28,179
Court ladies of the Joseon Dynasty...

2741
01:35:28,839 --> 01:35:32,649
applied soy sauce on their bodies for this.

2742
01:35:33,419 --> 01:35:34,649
What is this?

2743
01:35:36,489 --> 01:35:38,049
"Apply soy sauce on their bodies?"

2744
01:35:38,319 --> 01:35:40,119
My grandmother did this with soy sauce.

2745
01:35:40,659 --> 01:35:41,688
- The Joseon Dynasty? - I got it.

2746
01:35:41,689 --> 01:35:43,128
- He must know. - Rhymer.

2747
01:35:43,129 --> 01:35:44,289
The court ladies did this?

2748
01:35:44,789 --> 01:35:45,898
Mosquitoes?

2749
01:35:45,899 --> 01:35:48,159
It was to use as a repellent against bugs.

2750
01:35:48,399 --> 01:35:49,698
To use as a repellent against bugs.

2751
01:35:49,699 --> 01:35:50,968
Right.

2752
01:35:50,969 --> 01:35:52,468
- That sounds right. - Right.

2753
01:35:52,469 --> 01:35:54,498
(Answer: To use as a repellent against bugs)

2754
01:35:54,499 --> 01:35:55,708
That is incorrect.

2755
01:35:55,709 --> 01:35:57,469
(That is incorrect.)

2756
01:35:57,709 --> 01:35:59,778
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2757
01:35:59,779 --> 01:36:01,839
My heart is beating so fast.

2758
01:36:02,309 --> 01:36:03,748
(He changes the card right away.)

2759
01:36:03,749 --> 01:36:05,049
(Calm down!)

2760
01:36:05,279 --> 01:36:08,149
(One wrong answer will get them closer to paying the bill.)

2761
01:36:08,619 --> 01:36:11,318
They applied soy sauce on their bodies?

2762
01:36:11,319 --> 01:36:12,889
That wasn't the right answer.

2763
01:36:13,989 --> 01:36:16,188
I got it. It was out of superstition.

2764
01:36:16,189 --> 01:36:17,488
Superstition?

2765
01:36:17,489 --> 01:36:20,928
Right. It was to fend off bad spirits.

2766
01:36:20,929 --> 01:36:22,369
- Bad luck. - Incorrect.

2767
01:36:23,099 --> 01:36:24,269
- I got it! - WOONG!

2768
01:36:24,329 --> 01:36:25,599
- Go for it. - I got it.

2769
01:36:26,839 --> 01:36:28,499
It was to make their skin better.

2770
01:36:29,039 --> 01:36:30,239
It was to make their skin better.

2771
01:36:30,339 --> 01:36:31,439
Incorrect.

2772
01:36:31,539 --> 01:36:32,738
I don't have a clue then.

2773
01:36:32,739 --> 01:36:34,639
I got it. It was used...

2774
01:36:35,509 --> 01:36:37,548
like some sort of perfume.

2775
01:36:37,549 --> 01:36:39,248
I think it's that.

2776
01:36:39,249 --> 01:36:41,478
The pungent smell of soy sauce...

2777
01:36:41,479 --> 01:36:42,848
might feel unpleasant...

2778
01:36:42,849 --> 01:36:44,119
but attractive.

2779
01:36:45,219 --> 01:36:46,419
It might feel unpleasant...

2780
01:36:46,489 --> 01:36:48,219
but attractive.

2781
01:36:48,759 --> 01:36:50,088
Like the smell that comes from the crown of the head?

2782
01:36:50,089 --> 01:36:51,129
- It's like that? - Right.

2783
01:36:51,259 --> 01:36:52,759
Gosh.

2784
01:36:53,599 --> 01:36:55,558
It could smell pungent...

2785
01:36:55,559 --> 01:36:57,099
but attractive.

2786
01:36:57,469 --> 01:36:58,868
Are you serious?

2787
01:36:58,869 --> 01:37:00,739
- Even though it's unpleasant? - I see.

2788
01:37:00,839 --> 01:37:02,199
- Like the smell of a dog's paw. - Right.

2789
01:37:02,269 --> 01:37:04,508
- The smell of a dog's paw. - Right.

2790
01:37:04,509 --> 01:37:05,878
- It could be something like that. - The smell of a dog's paw.

2791
01:37:05,879 --> 01:37:07,008
- The smell of a dog's paw. - Gosh.

2792
01:37:07,009 --> 01:37:08,578
- That sounds off. Gosh. - All right.

2793
01:37:08,579 --> 01:37:10,248
- The smell of a dog's paw. - It was used...

2794
01:37:10,249 --> 01:37:12,978
as some sort of perfume.

2795
01:37:12,979 --> 01:37:14,178
- To cover their body odour. - Right.

2796
01:37:14,179 --> 01:37:15,218
It was used as some sort of perfume.

2797
01:37:15,219 --> 01:37:17,049
- Right. - Don't say the answer, Yi Kyung.

2798
01:37:17,205 --> 01:37:17,871
No way.
Incorrect.

2799
01:37:19,789 --> 01:37:21,618
- Why was soy sauce used? - There's nothing else then.

2800
01:37:21,619 --> 01:37:22,728
It was used by the court ladies.

2801
01:37:22,729 --> 01:37:24,558
What could it have been used for?

2802
01:37:24,559 --> 01:37:25,758
Skincare was already mentioned.

2803
01:37:25,759 --> 01:37:26,799
(Rhymer, WOONG, and Dong Hyun don't have a clue.)

2804
01:37:26,859 --> 01:37:28,309
They were court ladies.

2805
01:37:28,459 --> 01:37:31,299
Didn't court ladies have to look nice to the king?

2806
01:37:32,739 --> 01:37:34,090
I see. Isn't it this?

2807
01:37:34,539 --> 01:37:35,738
- Go for it. - Go for it.

2808
01:37:35,739 --> 01:37:37,109
- Just go for it. - Just go for it.

2809
01:37:37,409 --> 01:37:38,969
It was used to go on a diet.

2810
01:37:39,309 --> 01:37:41,008
- It was used for that? - It was used to go on a diet.

2811
01:37:41,009 --> 01:37:42,239
- I see. - That must be it.

2812
01:37:42,409 --> 01:37:44,009
- How was it used to go on a diet? - Rhymer.

2813
01:37:44,279 --> 01:37:45,779
Rhymer. I got it.

2814
01:37:45,849 --> 01:37:47,048
It was used to go on a diet.

2815
01:37:47,049 --> 01:37:48,148
(Answer: To go on a diet)

2816
01:37:48,149 --> 01:37:49,389
Correct.

2817
01:37:49,789 --> 01:37:50,819
CEO Rhymer!

2818
01:37:51,649 --> 01:37:52,959
Cheers!

2819
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:54,588
- To go on a diet? - Gosh.

2820
01:37:54,589 --> 01:37:55,858
(Rhymer and WOONG get exempted from paying.)

2821
01:37:55,859 --> 01:37:56,859
Nice one.

2822
01:37:56,860 --> 01:37:58,058
Rhymer got the answer on his own.

2823
01:37:58,059 --> 01:37:59,998
- How was it used to go on a diet? - It was used to go on a diet?

2824
01:37:59,999 --> 01:38:01,798
The court ladies of the Joseon Dynasty...

2825
01:38:01,799 --> 01:38:03,328
went on a diet and exercised for 100 days...

2826
01:38:03,329 --> 01:38:04,829
after applying soy sauce on their bodies.

2827
01:38:05,299 --> 01:38:07,068
It was because being active after applying soy sauce...

2828
01:38:07,069 --> 01:38:10,709
made them sweat a lot more than usual.

2829
01:38:12,039 --> 01:38:13,139
How did they know that?

2830
01:38:15,179 --> 01:38:16,248
- How did they know that? - Awesome.

2831
01:38:16,249 --> 01:38:17,308
Osmotic pressure?

2832
01:38:17,309 --> 01:38:18,378
- Rhymer... - Awesome.

2833
01:38:18,379 --> 01:38:20,679
got out of the swamp of paying on his own.

2834
01:38:22,149 --> 01:38:23,319
He made the perfect closing.

2835
01:38:23,389 --> 01:38:24,749
- "To go on a diet!" - Right.

2836
01:38:25,749 --> 01:38:28,618
It was been a while since Rhymer has returned.

2837
01:38:28,619 --> 01:38:29,828
I want to know how you felt about today.

2838
01:38:29,829 --> 01:38:31,259
Gosh.

2839
01:38:31,289 --> 01:38:33,629
Whenever I come to Handsome Guys,

2840
01:38:34,259 --> 01:38:36,029
I feel great.

2841
01:38:36,129 --> 01:38:37,828
I feel great and happy.

2842
01:38:37,829 --> 01:38:39,238
How was it for you, WOONG?

2843
01:38:39,239 --> 01:38:41,168
I could really see that my CEO was enjoying his time...

2844
01:38:41,169 --> 01:38:42,368
while being next to him.

2845
01:38:42,369 --> 01:38:44,068
That was why I really enjoyed this time...

2846
01:38:44,069 --> 01:38:45,668
and I think it was possible...

2847
01:38:45,669 --> 01:38:46,908
you all took great care of us.

2848
01:38:46,909 --> 01:38:47,978
Okay. Thank you.

2849
01:38:47,979 --> 01:38:49,508
- Thank you! - Thank you!

2850
01:38:49,509 --> 01:38:51,148
- Thank you for the meal. - Thank you.

2851
01:38:51,149 --> 01:38:52,749
Thank you for the meal. Thank you, everyone.

2852
01:38:53,419 --> 01:38:54,719
Here's the bill.

2853
01:38:54,849 --> 01:38:56,489
- I'm the one that will pay. - Right.

2854
01:38:56,549 --> 01:38:57,619
Thank you.

2855
01:38:58,251 --> 01:38:59,186
Gosh, I'm full.

2856
01:39:00,216 --> 01:39:02,985
(Crowded all 365 days a year)

2857
01:39:02,986 --> 01:39:04,285
(The biggest market in Seoul)

2858
01:39:04,286 --> 01:39:08,195
(Today's Menu Recommendation Spot, Gyeongdong Market)

2859
01:39:08,196 --> 01:39:13,396
(Who is the guest that will join them at Gyeongdong Market?)

2860
01:39:13,421 --> 01:39:17,061
(The smart guest that has returned, John Park)

2861
01:39:17,166 --> 01:39:20,176
(It's much easier for you guys these days.)

2862
01:39:20,276 --> 01:39:22,506
(Did you see us use our own cards to pay?)

2863
01:39:22,676 --> 01:39:25,105
(The one with experience already knows the rules.)

2864
01:39:25,106 --> 01:39:28,046
(Which dishes will the Handsome Guys pay for?)

2865
01:39:28,146 --> 01:39:32,485
(Simple but filling tastes)

2866
01:39:32,486 --> 01:39:37,386
(Familiar new tastes you can never forget about)

2867
01:39:37,731 --> 01:39:41,301
(Amazed)

2868
01:39:41,326 --> 01:39:43,166
(endlessly)

2869
01:39:43,326 --> 01:39:45,495
(It tastes like it was made by my grandmother.)

2870
01:39:45,496 --> 01:39:46,896
(Is your grandmother Korean?)

2871
01:39:47,196 --> 01:39:48,996
(Sang Uk?)

2872
01:39:49,436 --> 01:39:51,436
(The second time here feels even harder.)

2873
01:39:51,706 --> 01:39:52,735
(Yi Kyung is weird too.)

2874
01:39:52,736 --> 01:39:53,775
(The word is "cough.")

2875
01:39:53,776 --> 01:39:55,536
(Say that in English!)

2876
01:39:56,006 --> 01:39:58,676
(You're the one that knows how to speak in English.)

2877
01:40:00,576 --> 01:40:02,416
(The older ones are weird too.)

2878
01:40:03,021 --> 01:40:06,461
(The Handsome Guys are very silly.)

2879
01:40:06,486 --> 01:40:08,285
(Will John Park...)

2880
01:40:08,286 --> 01:40:13,296
(be able to spend a good day as a freeloader?)
