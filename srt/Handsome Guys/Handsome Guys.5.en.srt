1
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:31,570
(Jeju International Airport)

2
00:00:31,571 --> 00:00:34,042
(Current time: 8am)

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,930
I haven't been to Jeju Island in a while.

4
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:37,731
If we get penalty here,

5
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:40,271
it will be game over.

6
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,540
Hello.

7
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,139
This is my second time working here.

8
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,569
Only I have worked here, right?

9
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,570
You're right.

10
00:00:45,571 --> 00:00:47,409
I clearly remember those who went home first.

11
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,681
- Is it annoying?
- I remember them clearly.

12
00:00:48,811 --> 00:00:50,210
Does it hurt your feelings?

13
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:51,909
That's why I want to team up with you today.

14
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:53,950
(He wants to team up with Dong Hyun?)

15
00:00:53,951 --> 00:00:56,119
Oh, come on. It's better when only one gets the penalty.

16
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,390
I want to work with you today.

17
00:00:57,391 --> 00:00:58,420
- With me?
- Yes.

18
00:00:58,421 --> 00:00:59,891
I'll sacrifice myself.

19
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,619
I'll jump off with Dong Hyun on my back.

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,160
Why do you resent Dong Hyun?

21
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,430
- One bottle per day until 9pm?
- One is correct.

22
00:01:06,431 --> 00:01:07,729
One bottle at a time until 9pm?

23
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:08,730
He just got one right.

24
00:01:08,731 --> 00:01:10,200
Did I get one right each time?

25
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:13,229
One type of alcohol for the first round...

26
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,740
- and leaving by 9pm.
- Correct.

27
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:18,110
(After winning effortlessly, )

28
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,611
(his behavior was extremely annoying.)

29
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,380
Goodness, that's so unfair.

30
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:26,310
Either way, I will win again today.

31
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,080
If he teams up with you...

32
00:01:29,081 --> 00:01:30,849
and brings you down with him...

33
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:32,951
- I'm going to lose with you.
- He's going to lose.

34
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,221
If he gets in the way, I'll put him to sleep.

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,290
I'll put him to sleep for a while.

36
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,260
(When he strangles him lightly)

37
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:42,460
He'll go to sleep naturally for a while.

38
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:44,170
That's what I'll do.

39
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,899
There's a way to wake him up.

40
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,269
- Really?
- Yes.

41
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,599
How do you wake him up after strangling him?

42
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,871
He'll wake up when his legs get lifted.

43
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:52,841
After passing out, he'll get up suddenly.

44
00:01:52,971 --> 00:01:55,281
I don't need to hit him.

45
00:01:55,481 --> 00:01:56,781
He's an expert,

46
00:01:56,811 --> 00:01:58,951
so I can't argue with him about this.

47
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:01,121
He can put him to sleep?

48
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:02,849
And so...

49
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,989
Let's be honest. We know who's coming today.

50
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,221
Today's guest isn't coming here...

51
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,390
- just casually.
- No.

52
00:02:09,391 --> 00:02:11,761
He's extremely spiteful right now.

53
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:18,929
(Appearing on the show with extreme determination)

54
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,971
Let's see.

55
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,909
(Worldwide Handsome is back.)

56
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,940
There he is.

57
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:27,840
I get to see you so often these days.

58
00:02:27,841 --> 00:02:29,080
- Here he is.
- Hello.

59
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:30,549
(Jin's second appearance on the show)

60
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,250
Jin arrived here...

61
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,881
before us.

62
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:37,351
It was our first time seeing you work.

63
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,420
You're determined to take revenge on me and Sang Uk.

64
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:42,989
That's why I came back.

65
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,790
- Because of us?
- Yes.

66
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:46,990
The mackerel made me furious.

67
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,230
- That's why.
- I'd like to know.

68
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:50,870
On whom you want to take revenge?

69
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,929
You want to take revenge on the opposing team,

70
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,700
- or on your team?
- On your teammates?

71
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:55,870
On everyone.

72
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,541
- Five against...
- On everyone.

73
00:02:58,611 --> 00:02:59,739
(He's close to being John Wick.)

74
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,240
- Five against one?
- Five against one.

75
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:05,351
I want to see all of you work.

76
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,381
I want to see all of you work.

77
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:09,081
Five against one?

78
00:03:09,082 --> 00:03:11,049
(He came back to destroy everyone.)

79
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,790
For today's teams...

80
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,959
(For Jin's victory)

81
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,120
How will we split into teams?

82
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:19,030
Today, you get to divide us into teams.

83
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,559
You decide the teams...

84
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,399
- under one condition.
- What is it?

85
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,730
If you lose, you'll have to come back.

86
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:24,731
(Trying again for the 3rd time)

87
00:03:24,732 --> 00:03:25,930
Until you win.

88
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:28,940
(See you often, Jin.)

89
00:03:28,941 --> 00:03:31,440
You must feel slightly pressured to determine the teams.

90
00:03:31,441 --> 00:03:32,470
Right.

91
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:36,710
We'll let you pick your chance card right now.

92
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,451
Before splitting into teams?

93
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:39,981
To make themselves attractive?

94
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,719
Keep it a secret.

95
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,549
- Just with the look on your face?
- Okay.

96
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,719
You have to keep it a secret.

97
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:45,720
Okay.

98
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,660
(Tae Hyun is the first one to pick.)

99
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,261
I'm good at this.

100
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,190
Just like how I always do.

101
00:03:51,191 --> 00:03:52,191
Let's go.

102
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,060
(This will decide their luck today.)

103
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:58,331
(All 6 of them pick a card.)

104
00:03:58,601 --> 00:03:59,700
No.

105
00:03:59,701 --> 00:04:01,799
When you switch...

106
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,000
Try it.

107
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,739
Then you have to go again.

108
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,240
(He starts to scan the look on other members.)

109
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:12,851
Okay!

110
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,950
(Who picked...)

111
00:04:16,951 --> 00:04:19,650
(the lucky card that could contribute to Jin's victory?)

112
00:04:20,921 --> 00:04:23,821
(Everyone checks his card.)

113
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:25,930
- Do you want to switch?
- Seriously.

114
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:27,361
Do you want to switch? Let's do it.

115
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:29,160
- Do you want to switch?
- It's really not bad.

116
00:04:29,161 --> 00:04:31,499
Mine isn't bad either.

117
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,029
- I'll give you mine.
- Okay.

118
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,339
- Are you switching with mine?
- Yes.

119
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,541
You can't change your mind.

120
00:04:36,941 --> 00:04:40,580
(Did Jin burst out laughing?)

121
00:04:40,581 --> 00:04:41,979
This is what I know.

122
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,450
First of all, Tae Hyun won't be on my team.

123
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:45,681
Okay.

124
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,051
- He has my original card.
- What?

125
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:50,621
- Did you switch again?
- No.

126
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,051
Did you switch with him before me?

127
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:54,860
Yes.

128
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,359
- I didn't see you.
- Just now...

129
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,830
I'm giving you this for coming.

130
00:04:58,831 --> 00:04:59,959
Are you giving it to me?

131
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:01,330
I'm giving it to you so that you win.

132
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:03,500
- You didn't see us?
- That's not right.

133
00:05:03,501 --> 00:05:05,570
(That's not right.)

134
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:06,571
Hey.

135
00:05:07,001 --> 00:05:08,001
Jin.

136
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,340
This isn't so bad.

137
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,741
You don't know which card I had originally, do you?

138
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,441
Sang Uk got very unlucky.

139
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,181
He isn't talking anymore.

140
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,350
Is there a card worse than that?

141
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,550
Right.

142
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:22,919
(What does his forced laughter mean?)

143
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,789
- In the end, - In that case...

144
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,261
whom will Jin team up with?

145
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,691
Do you have the reattempt card?

146
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,960
It's a good one.

147
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:31,960
- A good one?
- Yes.

148
00:05:31,961 --> 00:05:33,130
- Is it really good?
- Yes.

149
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:34,659
Seriously? I pick you first.

150
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:37,700
Okay, this is good.

151
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:39,529
- Dong Hyun.
- Okay.

152
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,701
Do you have the reattempt card?

153
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,200
Just pick me.

154
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:44,310
Sang Uk...

155
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:46,110
- Is it a good one?
- Yes.

156
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,580
- Really?
- Yes.

157
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,039
- Yi Kyung, come.
- Okay.

158
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,680
(He picks Yi Kyung as his last member.)

159
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:52,850
- It's done.
- This is wrong.

160
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:54,919
Sang Uk, come here.

161
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,150
- I'm doomed.
- Come here.

162
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,251
We're completely doomed.

163
00:05:59,691 --> 00:06:01,520
- Mine is terrible.
- This is horrible.

164
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,991
Wait a minute.

165
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,631
This is...

166
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,931
We're doomed.

167
00:06:06,431 --> 00:06:07,561
(Is this really happening?)

168
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,000
Please reveal your card.

169
00:06:10,001 --> 00:06:11,201
Mine is Wishing Happy Birthday Card.

170
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:12,899
Is it any different from last time?

171
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,071
Is it birthday this week?

172
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,640
- Yes, this week.
- Is it the same?

173
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,741
How about you, Sang Uk?

174
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,370
- Me?
- His card is terrible.

175
00:06:18,371 --> 00:06:19,670
- What is it?
- What is it?

176
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:22,240
- Why do you keep...
- Picking tangerine card.

177
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:23,380
- What?
- What did you say?

178
00:06:23,381 --> 00:06:24,709
Picking tangerine card.

179
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,409
This is worse than bad luck.

180
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,821
- How do you keep picking bad cards?
- What?

181
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,589
It isn't so bad. You'll get to eat tangerines.

182
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:33,150
Right, I want some tangerines too.

183
00:06:33,991 --> 00:06:35,660
(Annoyed)

184
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,990
How about you, Seok Jin?

185
00:06:36,991 --> 00:06:38,860
Mine is 30-minute nap card.

186
00:06:39,991 --> 00:06:42,230
Yes, I gave him my 30-minute nap card.

187
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,729
Why did you switch with Jin?

188
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,599
I thought that he had something better.

189
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,270
- Why you...
- He deserves some scolding.

190
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,269
When I switched, I got a bad one.

191
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:54,010
Expecting something better, I switched with you,

192
00:06:54,011 --> 00:06:55,039
and it was worse.

193
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,381
(He ended up getting the picking tangerine card.)

194
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:58,250
(It all came back to me.)

195
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,681
Originally, it was 30 minutes, but now it turned to an hour.

196
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:02,880
Thank you, Sang Uk.

197
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:04,051
(Thanks to you, my team became perfect.)

198
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:06,849
My team ended up getting...

199
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,121
all the good cards.

200
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:11,690
They have to wish someone happy birthday and pick tangerines.

201
00:07:11,691 --> 00:07:13,289
They still have a reattempt card.

202
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,831
- They get one more chance.
- We also get to sleep.

203
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:18,300
(Today's theme is...)

204
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:21,100
(visiting beautiful Jeju Island's...)

205
00:07:21,871 --> 00:07:26,071
(architectural buildings.)

206
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:29,609
When you know about the building's background...

207
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,209
and architectural elements,

208
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:32,880
you can enjoy architecture much more.

209
00:07:32,881 --> 00:07:35,550
So we invited guests who will help you.

210
00:07:35,551 --> 00:07:37,220
- Please come out.
- Will they join us?

211
00:07:37,951 --> 00:07:39,821
- Hello.
- Hello.

212
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:41,691
I saw them often on EBS.

213
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,420
Where should I stand?

214
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,229
- Stand wherever you'd like.
- I can stand here.

215
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:46,430
Okay.

216
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,030
- Please introduce...
- Hello.

217
00:07:48,131 --> 00:07:49,830
- Please introduce yourselves.
- "House."

218
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:51,899
- Yes.
- "House."

219
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,169
Please introduce yourselves first.

220
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,270
(Introducing themselves)

221
00:07:54,371 --> 00:07:56,440
We're architects.

222
00:07:56,441 --> 00:07:58,470
Both of us are architects.

223
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,979
People think that we're siblings, but we're a married couple.

224
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,180
(Lim Hyoung Nam, Roh Eun Joo)

225
00:08:03,181 --> 00:08:05,110
Goodness, I misheard him say that they were siblings.

226
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,150
Like it's wearing a jacket, right?

227
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,779
(From explaining the essentials of the architectural building...)

228
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,650
(to analyzing the space)

229
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,331
(The architect couple does research endlessly.)

230
00:08:19,131 --> 00:08:22,030
(In various sizes and use)

231
00:08:22,761 --> 00:08:25,900
(They build houses where life exists.)

232
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,140
("Architecture is the land's dream...")

233
00:08:28,141 --> 00:08:29,600
(that tells stories of people's lives.)

234
00:08:30,371 --> 00:08:31,371
(It's great to meet you.)

235
00:08:31,371 --> 00:08:32,371
This is fascinating.

236
00:08:32,372 --> 00:08:35,480
We're interested in traditional architecture and Korean culture.

237
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,751
We're here to explain to you.

238
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:40,181
(I see.)

239
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:45,649
I'd like you to decide which team you'll guide.

240
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,250
Ms. Roh...

241
00:08:47,251 --> 00:08:48,820
- Do I get to choose first?
- Yes.

242
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:50,590
We're the losing team.

243
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:52,729
You may choose between the winning and losing teams.

244
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,229
I'll help you win.

245
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,230
(A fairy of victory)

246
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:56,230
I'll join this team.

247
00:08:56,231 --> 00:08:57,629
Gosh, thank you.

248
00:08:57,630 --> 00:08:58,670
(This is exciting.)

249
00:08:58,671 --> 00:08:59,831
She'll help us win.

250
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,640
She will help them win?

251
00:09:02,671 --> 00:09:03,869
How about us?

252
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:05,609
- It's not at all...
- What?

253
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,940
You've misunderstood.

254
00:09:06,941 --> 00:09:08,479
- Please help us win.
- This team?

255
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,810
We'd like to win too.

256
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:11,379
Then I'll help you win.

257
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,710
Thank you.

258
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,849
- The two of you will step out.
- Thank you.

259
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:18,989
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

260
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,651
- See you in a while.
- See you later.

261
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:24,120
- The losing team gets a penalty.
- Right.

262
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:26,331
This time, the regional activity is...

263
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:28,331
building stone walls.

264
00:09:29,431 --> 00:09:31,000
Stone walls?

265
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:34,599
(Stones of different sizes and shapes...)

266
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,411
(go through workers' hands.)

267
00:09:39,441 --> 00:09:41,810
(They connect with each other...)

268
00:09:41,811 --> 00:09:44,980
(in a sturdy way at a given spot.)

269
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,380
(Stone walls, one of Jeju Island's symbols, are built.)

270
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,749
Did you find a construction site?

271
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,750
Yes.

272
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:53,690
You want us to carry stones?

273
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:54,719
(Experience Jeju's architecture physically.)

274
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,020
It sounds quite romantic.

275
00:09:56,021 --> 00:09:57,220
(Building stone walls sounds more romantic than expected.)

276
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,791
Like last time, would you tell us...

277
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,200
where you're headed?

278
00:10:02,201 --> 00:10:03,259
Your first location.

279
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,530
- We're at a huge disadvantage.
- Yes.

280
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:07,369
Let's be honest.

281
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,369
We will lose an hour.

282
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:13,009
Just let us go here.

283
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,110
- Just this spot.
- Let us go here.

284
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,380
We won't be able to help it if Jin puts you to sleep.

285
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,720
They must follow the rules if you use your card.

286
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,820
I might want to see the airfield.

287
00:10:25,821 --> 00:10:27,390
He might put you to sleep.

288
00:10:27,421 --> 00:10:29,920
- Hey there.
- I believe that we've already lost.

289
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,190
- And so...
- Come on.

290
00:10:31,191 --> 00:10:32,331
Just let us go here.

291
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,901
I don't want to sleep until we get to Alddreu Airfield.

292
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,260
What do you think, Jin?

293
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:39,931
(Please, Jin...)

294
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,301
- Okay.
- Okay.

295
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:44,200
(Thank you, Jin.)

296
00:10:44,201 --> 00:10:46,440
Please get on the vehicles, make your plans,

297
00:10:46,441 --> 00:10:48,180
and set out when you're ready.

298
00:10:48,181 --> 00:10:49,411
- Okay.
- Let's go.

299
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,840
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

300
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,510
Which one is our car?

301
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,910
Be careful.

302
00:10:53,911 --> 00:10:55,119
- This one?
- Jin, sit in the front.

303
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,349
(Goodness)

304
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,489
- Are you driving?
- I'll drive.

305
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,749
(Pretending like nothing happened)

306
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,161
Gosh, it's cold.

307
00:11:01,691 --> 00:11:03,360
It's cold.

308
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,930
Why is it so cold?

309
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:06,030
(Team Handsome)

310
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:08,500
Take a look. If we're going here like Jin suggested...

311
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,259
- This is it.
- Yes.

312
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,071
After that, we'll go straight to Ctesiphon House.

313
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,770
Then we'll go to Mokwoljae which is nearby.

314
00:11:13,771 --> 00:11:14,771
(1. Winning places in the order of distance)

315
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:15,840
It's right here.

316
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:17,499
Then we can choose...

317
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,570
between these two.

318
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:20,509
(2. Complete the bingo based on the situation.)

319
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,580
- Do you get it?
- That's a good idea.

320
00:11:21,581 --> 00:11:24,209
I still think that we should win Alddreu Airfield...

321
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,879
We should let them go there.

322
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,979
Okay.

323
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,280
This is what I think.

324
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:29,619
We should leave them hope...

325
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,420
No, that could make us lose.

326
00:11:31,421 --> 00:11:33,089
I hate regretting it...

327
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,321
after yielding to the other team.

328
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:37,089
Let's do our best until the end.

329
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:38,290
- Then...
- We can apologize after winning.

330
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,390
- Should we put them to sleep?
- Let's go to Alddreu Airfield.

331
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,530
- Shall we go now?
- Let's go before them.

332
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:44,771
They haven't left yet.

333
00:11:44,931 --> 00:11:45,931
I don't know.

334
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:48,099
Team Handsome, we're setting out.

335
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,869
Our destination is Alddreu Airfield.

336
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,070
(Team Handsome's destination: Alddreu Airfield)

337
00:11:52,071 --> 00:11:53,770
Jin has to win.

338
00:11:53,771 --> 00:11:54,780
Okay.

339
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:56,980
- Jin has to win.
- I don't know anymore.

340
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:59,210
That's my plan for now.

341
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:01,950
You can't go to the airfield.

342
00:12:01,951 --> 00:12:04,249
(Sang Uk appears as if he heard them.)

343
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:06,750
Sang Uk, thank you so much.

344
00:12:06,951 --> 00:12:08,690
You're a good friend.

345
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:10,119
I thought that you had a good card.

346
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,259
Goodness.

347
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,630
Sang Uk promised to be good to me when I return.

348
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,229
(Definite after-sales service)

349
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:17,130
We have to go to the airfield.

350
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,470
What is it?

351
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:20,430
I'm not joking.

352
00:12:20,431 --> 00:12:22,700
It won't be possible for my team today.

353
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:23,970
What's not possible?

354
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,271
Many of you are so smart.

355
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,209
Who are you talking about?

356
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,510
Sleep well, Seung Ho.

357
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,180
- Sleep well.
- Please go easy on us.

358
00:12:33,181 --> 00:12:34,250
Sleep well, Seung Ho.

359
00:12:36,321 --> 00:12:37,619
I'm putting on the seat belt.

360
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,821
We can get going now.

361
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:41,389
(Team Handsome sets off.)

362
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,620
Has the other team left yet?

363
00:12:42,821 --> 00:12:44,120
No, not yet.

364
00:12:44,831 --> 00:12:45,959
They haven't left yet.

365
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:46,960
(Leaving the airport quickly)

366
00:12:47,831 --> 00:12:48,931
Which address did you enter?

367
00:12:49,701 --> 00:12:51,401
You told us to go to Alddreu Airfield.

368
00:12:51,931 --> 00:12:54,270
If we follow my suggestion and things don't go well,

369
00:12:54,271 --> 00:12:56,100
you'll resent me.

370
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:59,411
- What do you think?
- Make a decision as our leader.

371
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,979
In a short period of time,

372
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,980
you came up with a good plan.

373
00:13:02,981 --> 00:13:05,311
Does the center square attract you the most?

374
00:13:06,281 --> 00:13:07,380
How about you, Jin?

375
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,151
My strategy is...

376
00:13:09,551 --> 00:13:10,720
winning as much as possible.

377
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,750
That's what I think.

378
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:14,350
Yi Kyung, please decide.

379
00:13:15,061 --> 00:13:16,321
What's your decision?

380
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,090
Wait a minute.

381
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,660
(The leader is deep in thoughts.)

382
00:13:20,661 --> 00:13:22,701
I want to eat something right here too.

383
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,031
- I liked Yi Kyung's plan, too.
- What?

384
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:27,801
What do you think, Yi Kyung?

385
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:30,901
Now that we got here,

386
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:32,810
- we're too far...
- We can't go back, can we?

387
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,540
- from M Guesthouse.
- Right.

388
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,081
We can always go back.

389
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:38,209
- What do you want to do?
- I don't know.

390
00:13:38,210 --> 00:13:39,680
You made us waver.

391
00:13:39,681 --> 00:13:40,979
I don't know anymore.

392
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,421
Let's win the airfield.

393
00:13:42,651 --> 00:13:44,920
After that, we'll win in order.

394
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:46,951
We'll be cheap and break our promise.

395
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:49,620
Will you be okay about fooling them?

396
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:51,760
- Let's go to Alddreu Airfield.
- Okay.

397
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,989
It will give us an upper hand.

398
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:55,729
Winning the center will be a big advantage.

399
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:56,800
(Team Handsome heads to Alddreu Airfield.)

400
00:13:56,801 --> 00:14:00,271
(50 minutes before getting to Alddreu Airfield)

401
00:14:00,331 --> 00:14:01,469
And so...

402
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,540
(Team Guys)

403
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,540
Ctesiphon House, Mokwoljae.

404
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,171
Take a look at this.

405
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:10,210
Do you think that they'd hand us the airfield...

406
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,951
so easily?

407
00:14:12,581 --> 00:14:14,010
What do you think?

408
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,920
I don't think that they will.

409
00:14:15,921 --> 00:14:17,350
- They probably won't, right?
- Right.

410
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,551
If that's what we think...

411
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:22,859
- There are M Guesthouse, - Right.

412
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,389
V Garden, and Mokwoljae on the left.

413
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,031
- Aren't they very far?
- These?

414
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,301
Look at the map.

415
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:31,600
Wouldn't they avoid these?

416
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,401
So you want us to go after them?

417
00:14:33,771 --> 00:14:37,339
- These three?
- M Guesthouse, V Garden...

418
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,440
And Mokwoljae.

419
00:14:38,441 --> 00:14:40,509
Isn't that our only solution?

420
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:42,440
We'll get there before our nap.

421
00:14:42,441 --> 00:14:44,510
Okay, shall we head to the guesthouse?

422
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:45,910
After that...

423
00:14:45,911 --> 00:14:48,020
If we find them there, we will head...

424
00:14:48,021 --> 00:14:49,450
- to the airfield.
- The airfield.

425
00:14:49,451 --> 00:14:52,550
Even if we sleep for 30 minutes, we'll get there before them.

426
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:53,849
Okay.

427
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:55,660
That sounds like a good strategy.

428
00:14:55,661 --> 00:14:56,690
Going where they wouldn't go.

429
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:58,831
If we get the question wrong,

430
00:14:59,531 --> 00:15:02,229
let's just go anywhere.

431
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,931
(Feeling sad)

432
00:15:04,161 --> 00:15:05,801
It won't be easy to win today.

433
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:08,100
We're off to a terrible start.

434
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,540
(They will have to nap, )

435
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:11,910
(wish someone happy birthday, )

436
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,811
(and pick tangerines.)

437
00:15:13,911 --> 00:15:16,411
I'd feel the best if we win today.

438
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:19,509
- It would be...
- A huge comeback.

439
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:22,180
We have less than ten-percent chance of winning.

440
00:15:22,181 --> 00:15:24,890
It'd be like making to the semifinal during the 2002 World Cup.

441
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:28,521
It's close to being impossible.

442
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:31,589
You can find delicious noodles in meat broth here.

443
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,489
Jeju's noodles in meat broth?

444
00:15:33,490 --> 00:15:34,630
(No matter the situation, they're hungry.)

445
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:37,701
Noodles in meat broth and black pork.

446
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,970
And ara.

447
00:15:40,071 --> 00:15:41,441
Ara is really good.

448
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,640
(They get motivated by the food talk.)

449
00:15:42,641 --> 00:15:45,510
If we could get ara, it'd be amazing.

450
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,510
Will you eat if it's ara?

451
00:15:47,941 --> 00:15:49,340
Definitely.

452
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,450
(That's cute.)

453
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,109
Eating ara would make...

454
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,749
this trip worth it.

455
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:55,951
By eating ara?

456
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,420
So we'll eat it no matter what.

457
00:15:58,421 --> 00:15:59,550
(Eating that would be worth losing.)

458
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:01,090
Definitely. At least one serving.

459
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,690
Ara sounds delicious.

460
00:16:03,691 --> 00:16:05,359
(While dreaming of small things, they arrive at the first location.)

461
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,661
Is it this way?

462
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,161
Are they here or not?

463
00:16:10,561 --> 00:16:12,401
Are they here or not?

464
00:16:13,171 --> 00:16:15,571
- Are they here or not?
- I don't think so.

465
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,599
I don't think that they're here.

466
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,410
This is our only solution.

467
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:20,811
They must have gone to Alddreu Airfield.

468
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,379
(Located in the city with the view of the sea)

469
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:29,051
(A black building with a unique shape)

470
00:16:29,921 --> 00:16:33,691
(Black outer walls that look like a boulder)

471
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,860
(An impressive observatory that rises towards the sky)

472
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,229
Is this it?

473
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,729
(M Guesthouse)

474
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:42,960
That must be it. It's shaped like an armored vehicle.

475
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:44,700
(The fascinating form fills them with awe.)

476
00:16:44,701 --> 00:16:45,999
It looks interesting.

477
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,200
(The fascinating form fills them with awe.)

478
00:16:47,201 --> 00:16:49,701
Does "mir" mean dragon?

479
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:51,470
Is that why it's shaped like a dragon?

480
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,140
It's nicely built.

481
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,581
Welcome.

482
00:16:56,210 --> 00:16:57,510
Hello.

483
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:58,810
Is it shaped like a dragon?

484
00:16:58,811 --> 00:16:59,979
Can you tell?

485
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:02,980
- That's so funny.
- These are eyes and mouth.

486
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:04,520
It looks cool.

487
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:05,619
(A cute form like a dinosaur)

488
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,560
Around the corner, a famous spot in Jeju...

489
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:10,160
- Yongduam Rock.
- That's right.

490
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:13,790
It was inspired by the shape of Yongduam Rock.

491
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,160
- Is that so?
- If you've been there,

492
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,400
- you'd understand easily.
- Is that why...

493
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:19,700
- Right.
- the walls are painted black?

494
00:17:19,701 --> 00:17:22,440
- It was inspired by Jeju's basalt.
- Right?

495
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:23,941
(Yongduam Rock, oddly formed with basalt)

496
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:27,610
(Based on a famous tourist spot in Jeju, )

497
00:17:28,811 --> 00:17:32,649
(the architect designed a guesthouse building.)

498
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,821
Most buildings are built for practical use,

499
00:17:35,321 --> 00:17:37,480
but this looks far from being practical...

500
00:17:37,481 --> 00:17:39,550
- That's not true.
- Is it different inside?

501
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:41,291
It still has to be functional.

502
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,460
It's fascinating.

503
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:43,520
Aren't you curious...

504
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:44,561
- about the interior?
- Yes.

505
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,390
- Shall we go?
- Yes, let's go.

506
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:50,129
This isn't the entrance.

507
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,470
Is it not the entrance?

508
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:52,971
You have to turn around the corner.

509
00:17:53,471 --> 00:17:56,041
- This building isn't very common.
- Right.

510
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,270
It feels like you're walking in an alley.

511
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:01,711
(You must enter the alley to find the entrance.)

512
00:18:02,011 --> 00:18:04,850
So far, it looks like a turtle ship.

513
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:06,380
Right?

514
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,349
It's also like an armored vehicle that I mentioned earlier.

515
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,521
You have to get to the back of the building.

516
00:18:12,021 --> 00:18:14,089
Like you're walking in an alley.

517
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:16,920
This is very unusual.

518
00:18:16,961 --> 00:18:18,190
Shall we go inside?

519
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:20,230
I'm more curious about the inside.

520
00:18:20,231 --> 00:18:21,231
(A red door opens at the back of the building.)

521
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:22,899
(They exclaim as soon as they enter.)

522
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,929
Is this called an inner court?

523
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,699
- Yes, it's called inner court.
- Inner court.

524
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,899
- Look at this.
- When you come inside,

525
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,800
- This is unbelievable.
- in the middle of the building,

526
00:18:29,801 --> 00:18:31,909
an empty space like this is...

527
00:18:31,910 --> 00:18:33,970
- called inner court.
- Inner court?

528
00:18:33,971 --> 00:18:36,781
- It's also called sunken balcony.
- Unbelievable.

529
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:39,550
- Doesn't it feel like outside?
- Yes.

530
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,080
To give that atmosphere...

531
00:18:41,081 --> 00:18:44,150
- Rain and snow would fall here.
- You'd get wet.

532
00:18:44,251 --> 00:18:45,450
Exactly.

533
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:48,120
The gap was extended as much as possible...

534
00:18:48,491 --> 00:18:50,390
for people to feel the exterior.

535
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:52,930
It's fascinating.

536
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,331
Since it's a guesthouse, take a look at the rooms.

537
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,869
(It's time to look at the bedrooms next door.)

538
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,471
- Are there beds right here?
- Right here.

539
00:19:02,301 --> 00:19:05,669
This is what a guesthouse looks like.

540
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,869
(Traveler's bedroom, the symbol of guesthouses)

541
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,011
This is the most fascinating point. As you can see,

542
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:10,180
the bed is in the air.

543
00:19:10,511 --> 00:19:12,510
- There are no legs.
- You're right.

544
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,251
- What do you mean?
- That's true.

545
00:19:14,311 --> 00:19:18,119
When you climb onto a bed, it squeaks and shakes.

546
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,790
To prevent that, it's hanging from the ceiling.

547
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,490
It's fixed on the ceiling.

548
00:19:21,491 --> 00:19:24,359
- There's a feeling of floating.
- I see.

549
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,231
- Right, there are no pillars.
- Right.

550
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,800
(A brilliant design idea to get rid of noises that interfere with sleep)

551
00:19:30,801 --> 00:19:33,400
What would happen when there are three in the room?

552
00:19:33,471 --> 00:19:34,630
- Three people?
- Yes.

553
00:19:35,271 --> 00:19:36,741
Three people here?

554
00:19:36,771 --> 00:19:38,369
- How?
- The top bunk is wider.

555
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,939
It's wider on top, isn't it?

556
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:42,439
The wall is leaning instead of being straight.

557
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,780
- So there's more space.
- It's more spacious inside.

558
00:19:44,781 --> 00:19:46,511
The bed can be for two people.

559
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:48,949
There are some hidden design tricks.

560
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:52,120
(Two on top and one at the bottom can sleep.)

561
00:19:52,251 --> 00:19:53,750
- Shall we go upstairs?
- Okay.

562
00:19:53,751 --> 00:19:55,461
This is so fascinating.

563
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,930
This is where...

564
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:01,630
guests can get together and eat.

565
00:20:01,831 --> 00:20:03,000
(A rest area with warm sunlight)

566
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,629
- Oh, my.
- As you can see,

567
00:20:04,630 --> 00:20:06,400
there's a view over there.

568
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:10,541
(The rest area's ceiling reaches to the 3rd floor.)

569
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:16,140
(There's refreshing openness for the travelers.)

570
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,481
Gosh, I love this place.

571
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,120
Do you know what these diamond-shaped windows represent?

572
00:20:24,221 --> 00:20:26,220
- Is it the mouth?
- Yes.

573
00:20:26,221 --> 00:20:29,060
- At first glance...
- The teeth.

574
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:32,031
As you can see, there are windows...

575
00:20:32,491 --> 00:20:34,360
even on the ceiling.

576
00:20:34,531 --> 00:20:37,730
These holes represent holes in basalt.

577
00:20:37,731 --> 00:20:38,800
(Diamond-shaped windows equal holes in basalt.)

578
00:20:38,801 --> 00:20:40,231
Holes in basalt?

579
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:42,571
(Tae Hyun inside the hole of basalt)

580
00:20:42,801 --> 00:20:44,839
(The basalt's rough texture is expressed with windows.)

581
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,470
The roughness comes...

582
00:20:47,471 --> 00:20:51,710
from nature and rocks in the sea on Jeju Island.

583
00:20:51,711 --> 00:20:53,949
Usually, we travel...

584
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,480
to experience new things.

585
00:20:56,481 --> 00:20:59,419
There are nice and comfortable hotels.

586
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,390
You can travel for comfort as well.

587
00:21:01,991 --> 00:21:05,530
This provides a new type of space...

588
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:08,060
- and experience to travelers.
- This is...

589
00:21:08,061 --> 00:21:10,600
- a much better strategy.
- I agree.

590
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:13,770
There's more upstairs.

591
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:14,870
- Shall we go up?
- Sure.

592
00:21:16,471 --> 00:21:17,939
- It's red.
- Red?

593
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,271
(Team Guys come up to the highest floor.)

594
00:21:23,011 --> 00:21:25,350
(When you go outside through the open door)

595
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:34,090
(A rooftop theater, the travelers' place for fun)

596
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:41,031
(The highlight of M Guesthouse, the dragon head observatory)

597
00:21:43,531 --> 00:21:46,331
This is another space.

598
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,070
It's the highlight of this place.

599
00:21:49,071 --> 00:21:50,139
(Fascinated)

600
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,570
- Can't we have a barbecue?
- Right.

601
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:54,070
It's an outdoor space.

602
00:21:54,071 --> 00:21:57,210
It's an outdoor space, and there are stairs.

603
00:21:57,211 --> 00:21:58,310
It's very fascinating.

604
00:21:58,311 --> 00:21:59,949
What kind of space would it be when people sit here?

605
00:21:59,950 --> 00:22:02,180
It looks like a theater.

606
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:05,120
- There must be a projector.
- With a projection...

607
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,090
A projector?

608
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,190
There are many things to do here.

609
00:22:10,821 --> 00:22:12,731
It can be a theater.

610
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:15,331
It can be a place where people drink.

611
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,461
It's also a terrace.

612
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:20,669
It'd be great to watch something from here.

613
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:22,270
- It's nice.
- When you go up higher,

614
00:22:22,271 --> 00:22:23,840
you can see Mount Halla.

615
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:25,540
- You can see Mount Halla?
- Please go up.

616
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:28,409
This is really fascinating.

617
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:31,011
It's the highlight of this guesthouse.

618
00:22:31,281 --> 00:22:33,751
This design is really groundbreaking.

619
00:22:33,781 --> 00:22:35,050
At this guesthouse...

620
00:22:35,051 --> 00:22:36,150
(How about the view of the city from the observatory?)

621
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,649
- I didn't know it was this high.
- This is...

622
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,389
(A panoramic view of the city of Jeju)

623
00:22:42,390 --> 00:22:44,521
It's much higher than I thought.

624
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,389
The design is so brilliant.

625
00:22:47,390 --> 00:22:49,231
I'd love to own a building like this.

626
00:22:49,561 --> 00:22:52,731
You can do everything here including playing games.

627
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:54,731
The view is amazing too.

628
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,801
You can do many things.

629
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:00,670
The snow hasn't melted on top, has it?

630
00:23:00,811 --> 00:23:02,410
The snow hasn't melted yet.

631
00:23:03,541 --> 00:23:04,639
(They enjoyed the magnificent view of the snowy mountain.)

632
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,251
You can really see Mount Halla.

633
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,711
It's a beautiful view.

634
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:11,650
When we were outside, you were worried...

635
00:23:11,690 --> 00:23:14,119
- that it wouldn't be functional.
- Right.

636
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,090
As a guesthouse,

637
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,929
it has the best functions.

638
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,961
There are things to see.

639
00:23:21,061 --> 00:23:24,830
It wouldn't be fun if the guesthouse looked...

640
00:23:24,831 --> 00:23:27,700
like one's home.

641
00:23:28,571 --> 00:23:31,301
Architects are very interesting.

642
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:32,939
How did they come up with such an idea?

643
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,071
(Time for Quiz)

644
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:36,740
I can't imagine possible questions.

645
00:23:36,741 --> 00:23:38,310
Today,

646
00:23:38,311 --> 00:23:39,550
we shouldn't stop ourselves.

647
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,650
Let's do however we feel.

648
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,680
Here's your question.

649
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,090
There's unique marriage culture on Jeju Island.

650
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:51,261
After the wedding, to welcome the bride...

651
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,330
to the family,

652
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:57,030
her in-laws provide her a table full of food.

653
00:23:57,031 --> 00:23:58,060
A table full of food?

654
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,429
- For the bride.
- The groom does this act...

655
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,700
to express his love for his bride.

656
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,170
How is this act?

657
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,511
Does he scoop a huge amount of rice?

658
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:12,679
- That's not bad.
- It's all I can come up with.

659
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,909
- The groom...
- He serves her a lot of rice.

660
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,150
(He serves her a lot of rice...)

661
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,620
Does he drink alcohol...

662
00:24:18,551 --> 00:24:20,190
from a bowl?

663
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,061
The bride receives food.

664
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,291
She receives her table of food.

665
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,090
She receives it.

666
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,859
Does he knock the table over?

667
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,501
(What?)

668
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:31,730
The bride...

669
00:24:31,731 --> 00:24:33,199
- All right.
- Do it with a lot of force.

670
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,541
- Congratulations, darling.
- He knocks over the table?

671
00:24:36,571 --> 00:24:37,639
He serves her rice.

672
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:38,669
(He serves her rice.)

673
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:40,071
That's what I think.

674
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,410
So this is what you're saying.

675
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:45,781
How much rice he serves her expresses...

676
00:24:46,281 --> 00:24:48,251
- his love for her.
- Right.

677
00:24:48,751 --> 00:24:50,520
- Is it based on the amount?
- Could it be?

678
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:52,449
Where is this delicious smell coming from?

679
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,949
It smells like meat.

680
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:56,290
- I keep smelling LA ribs.
- Right.

681
00:24:56,291 --> 00:24:57,690
It definitely smells like meat.

682
00:24:58,160 --> 00:25:00,290
Marinated in some sweet soy sauce.

683
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,530
- Right?
- It smells like LA ribs.

684
00:25:02,531 --> 00:25:04,630
This is it. They're giving us a hint.

685
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:05,869
On Jeju Island.

686
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,169
(Sniffing)

687
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,170
Seung Ho, that could be the answer.

688
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:12,811
He gives her a pile of rice as much as his love.

689
00:25:13,241 --> 00:25:14,470
From her in-laws...

690
00:25:14,471 --> 00:25:15,810
(Exclaiming)

691
00:25:15,811 --> 00:25:16,811
This is...

692
00:25:16,811 --> 00:25:17,811
(The smell is incredible.)

693
00:25:17,812 --> 00:25:20,409
If we get it right, we'll get to eat it.

694
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,449
(We'll win this food if we get the right answer.)

695
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,419
- I mean...
- If we get the right answer...

696
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,619
Actually, I'm hungry.

697
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,390
Our answer is too intense.

698
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:28,420
How about this?

699
00:25:29,061 --> 00:25:32,331
We've already accepted being at a disadvantage.

700
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,031
Since we have a reattempt card...

701
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,099
Shall we go with your answer?

702
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,060
If we lose here,

703
00:25:38,061 --> 00:25:41,369
- we won't have a chance.
- There's no solution.

704
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:44,400
We made our plans after agreeing to occupy this.

705
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,471
I think the menu changed. It smells different.

706
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,410
- I also smell some fish.
- Right.

707
00:25:53,751 --> 00:25:56,380
I don't think it smells like LA ribs.

708
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:58,179
That's not the quiz.

709
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:01,250
You were exactly right.

710
00:26:01,251 --> 00:26:03,359
I'm sure that the meat was grilled.

711
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,659
(Their personal league starts again.)

712
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,330
Meat was definitely grilled.

713
00:26:07,331 --> 00:26:09,429
It could be the smell of braised hairtail.

714
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:11,000
It smells like ribs right now.

715
00:26:11,001 --> 00:26:12,971
- I agree.
- It smells like ribs.

716
00:26:13,231 --> 00:26:14,970
- There was definitely meat.
- Galbijjim.

717
00:26:14,971 --> 00:26:17,001
Now, there's fish on the grill.

718
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,511
Maybe it's because it's the answer.

719
00:26:21,211 --> 00:26:22,581
(I want to eat.)

720
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,210
Rice.

721
00:26:24,211 --> 00:26:25,379
- I think it's right.
- That's it.

722
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,449
It's definitely rice.

723
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,811
It's the only thing I can think of.

724
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,520
- The groom scoops...
- If it's correct...

725
00:26:30,521 --> 00:26:33,550
a big spoonful of rice.

726
00:26:33,551 --> 00:26:35,050
(The groom scoops a big spoonful of rice.)

727
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,119
(Shameless)

728
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,260
- What?
- You promised to say it in detail.

729
00:26:39,261 --> 00:26:42,100
All right, he gets a big spoonful of rice...

730
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,561
and feeds the bride.

731
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:47,100
The groom gets a big spoonful of rice...

732
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,500
- and feeds the bride.
- Right.

733
00:26:49,501 --> 00:26:53,970
(The groom feeds the bride a big spoonful of rice.)

734
00:26:53,971 --> 00:26:54,971
Correct.

735
00:26:54,972 --> 00:26:58,280
(Correct)

736
00:26:58,281 --> 00:27:00,349
Seriously? He feeds her?

737
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:01,450
He feeds her.

738
00:27:02,481 --> 00:27:03,919
I wasn't sure in the middle of it.

739
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,149
(Seung Ho does an amazing job in the first quiz.)

740
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,550
You're different from Dong Hyun.

741
00:27:06,551 --> 00:27:07,650
I agree.

742
00:27:09,291 --> 00:27:11,791
Now that your answer was right, take a look.

743
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:13,560
The color changed.

744
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:14,730
The color changed.

745
00:27:14,731 --> 00:27:17,200
- Please call me Mr. Brain.
- I knew it.

746
00:27:18,331 --> 00:27:20,470
Seung Ho, it's noodles in meat broth.

747
00:27:20,471 --> 00:27:22,800
(They win noodles in meat broth that they talked about.)

748
00:27:22,801 --> 00:27:24,070
- He kept craving them.
- Let's hurry.

749
00:27:24,071 --> 00:27:25,100
Let's get going.

750
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:29,080
(M Guesthouse)

751
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,110
Noodles in meat broth.

752
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,781
Let me tell you one more thing.

753
00:27:34,581 --> 00:27:37,280
The other team used the 30-minute nap card.

754
00:27:37,281 --> 00:27:38,950
(The 30-minute nap card is in action.)

755
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,051
Let's just do our best today.

756
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:42,961
Let's put them to sleep now.

757
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:44,561
Think about it.

758
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,331
If we get there before them without using the nap card,

759
00:27:47,561 --> 00:27:49,630
we'll have the upper hand even more.

760
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,001
I like playing games.

761
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:55,500
There are many items that I save until they become useless.

762
00:27:55,501 --> 00:27:57,301
- Right.
- That's true.

763
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,110
Jin has the nap card, so you decide.

764
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,140
- Put them to sleep.
- Okay.

765
00:28:02,741 --> 00:28:05,910
We'll use our 30-minute nap card right now.

766
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,711
Put the other team to sleep.

767
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,081
Can't we eat before going to sleep?

768
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:12,090
Please eat after your nap.

769
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,350
Go to sleep?

770
00:28:13,351 --> 00:28:15,790
They're cooking hard right now.

771
00:28:15,791 --> 00:28:18,021
- I think the food is ready.
- It isn't your food.

772
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:20,330
That food isn't for you.

773
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:21,761
Yes, it is.

774
00:28:22,801 --> 00:28:25,570
It smells so good. Where is it coming from?

775
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:26,630
I'm serious about this.

776
00:28:27,170 --> 00:28:28,700
What kind of restaurant is it?

777
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,000
Where did the smell go?

778
00:28:31,001 --> 00:28:32,870
- Goodness.
- Where is it coming from?

779
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,581
- Where is the smell coming from?
- I think it's here.

780
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:39,511
- It must be a cafeteria.
- It's a cafeteria.

781
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:41,051
Are ribs served?

782
00:28:41,910 --> 00:28:43,649
(Team Guys come for a nap.)

783
00:28:43,650 --> 00:28:45,280
Wait, how do I climb up here?

784
00:28:45,281 --> 00:28:46,650
I'll take off my shoes and go up.

785
00:28:47,991 --> 00:28:49,090
Isn't it too small?

786
00:28:49,420 --> 00:28:51,761
- It's really spacious.
- I don't know anymore.

787
00:28:52,991 --> 00:28:54,460
The bed is very strong.

788
00:28:54,461 --> 00:28:56,501
It's very wide.

789
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,429
It's nice and warm up here.

790
00:28:58,430 --> 00:28:59,501
(The best bed that's strong, wide, and warm)

791
00:28:59,731 --> 00:29:00,971
- Here...
- Start.

792
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,399
(It hasn't started yet.)

793
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,810
We've been sleeping from 20 minutes.

794
00:29:06,811 --> 00:29:08,940
I'm glad that they aren't playing music today.

795
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,640
- By the way...
- Darn it.

796
00:29:11,811 --> 00:29:14,380
(Suddenly getting up)

797
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:17,180
I can't sleep because of that.

798
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:19,221
Goodness.

799
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:21,419
(However, he yawns right away.)

800
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,420
Goodness.

801
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,690
(They're in sleeping mode on the top bunk.)

802
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:32,370
(Sleep deeply for 30 minutes.)

803
00:29:33,801 --> 00:29:35,399
(Team Handsome)

804
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,199
I've been to Jeju Island so many times,

805
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,770
but it's my first time at Alddreu Airfield.

806
00:29:38,771 --> 00:29:39,811
I know.

807
00:29:40,410 --> 00:29:42,639
Isn't it close to the sea?

808
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,939
Yes, it's in the south.

809
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:46,981
I read on the Internet that during the Japanese colonial period,

810
00:29:47,281 --> 00:29:50,619
people at Moseulpo Port were forced to build it.

811
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:52,190
It was built to block something.

812
00:29:52,821 --> 00:29:54,449
In the shape of an airplane?

813
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:56,490
- No, that's a hangar.
- Hangar.

814
00:29:56,491 --> 00:29:57,491
- Hangar?
- Right.

815
00:29:57,492 --> 00:29:59,461
That's in the shape of an airplane.

816
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:01,761
That looks like a checkpoint.

817
00:30:02,731 --> 00:30:04,330
It could be that.

818
00:30:04,331 --> 00:30:06,300
Was it built during the Japanese colonial period?

819
00:30:06,301 --> 00:30:08,169
(Traces of an airfield under Mount Sanbang)

820
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,771
I didn't know there was such a place on Jeju Island.

821
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:11,639
I had no idea either.

822
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,869
(They thought that they've been here often, )

823
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,110
(but it's their first time here.)

824
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:19,950
(On top of a wide field that looks like an ordinary farmland)

825
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:24,251
(What kind of story remains here?)

826
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:30,190
(Alddreu Airfield)

827
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:34,430
(Handsome Heritage 2: An invaders' ruin)

828
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:35,830
We must be here.

829
00:30:35,831 --> 00:30:37,399
(Team Handsome arrives.)

830
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,170
- Okay.
- Okay, let's go.

831
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:42,101
Let's try to guess without hints.

832
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,170
That'd be great.

833
00:30:43,171 --> 00:30:44,801
If we can guess without hints, it'd be amazing.

834
00:30:45,271 --> 00:30:46,739
We'll get it no matter what.

835
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,371
Then we're sure to win.

836
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:50,811
I want to taste the victory at least once.

837
00:30:51,341 --> 00:30:52,611
One thing is for sure.

838
00:30:53,011 --> 00:30:55,311
If I get the penalty again today, I'll be resentful.

839
00:30:55,450 --> 00:30:56,821
Wouldn't you come back out of pride?

840
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,990
Yes, I'd come back.

841
00:30:59,851 --> 00:31:03,790
(The chief is waiting for Team Handsome.)

842
00:31:03,791 --> 00:31:04,919
- Sir.
- I'm not confident.

843
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,929
- Hello.
- You arrived...

844
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:07,959
- like you've teleported here.
- Thank you for coming.

845
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,330
How did he get here so fast?

846
00:31:09,331 --> 00:31:11,101
- Did you find your way easily?
- Like NPC.

847
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:12,730
Really?

848
00:31:12,731 --> 00:31:13,929
Alddreu Airfield.

849
00:31:13,930 --> 00:31:16,969
We've been to Jeju Island many times including Moseulpo Port,

850
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:18,639
- but we didn't know about this.
- Right.

851
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,639
Most people don't know about it.

852
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,770
Isn't the name interesting?

853
00:31:21,771 --> 00:31:23,040
- Alddreu.
- Alddreu.

854
00:31:23,041 --> 00:31:25,340
Doesn't "Alddreu" sound like a foreign name?

855
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:26,510
- It sounds like French.
- Isn't it Jeju dialect?

856
00:31:26,511 --> 00:31:27,550
It's a word in Jeju dialect.

857
00:31:27,551 --> 00:31:28,551
- Really?
- Yes.

858
00:31:28,552 --> 00:31:29,879
It sounds like a dialect.

859
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,751
It's a word in Jeju dialect.

860
00:31:31,851 --> 00:31:34,150
"Al" means under.

861
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:37,960
- "Ddreu" refers to a wide field.
- A field?

862
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,189
(Alddreu means a wide field...)

863
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,959
(in the south of the island.)

864
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:45,030
Isn't it interesting? It looks like farmland.

865
00:31:45,031 --> 00:31:48,699
No one would imagine that it was an airfield.

866
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,700
Right.

867
00:31:52,371 --> 00:31:55,510
(How was an airfield built here?)

868
00:31:55,511 --> 00:31:57,340
Alddreu Airfield was...

869
00:31:57,341 --> 00:32:00,350
built during the Japanese colonial period.

870
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:03,280
When the Japanese were in the middle of a war,

871
00:32:03,281 --> 00:32:07,420
they built this airfield to attack Nanjing.

872
00:32:07,751 --> 00:32:10,790
In the past with old technology,

873
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:13,560
flying from Japan to China at once was too far.

874
00:32:13,561 --> 00:32:16,361
Refueling and maintenance on the way were necessary.

875
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:20,500
That's why Alddreu Airfield was built.

876
00:32:20,501 --> 00:32:23,270
- So it was built for the Japanese.
- Right.

877
00:32:23,271 --> 00:32:24,900
It was for Japan during the war.

878
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:29,479
(Alddreu Airfield was used...)

879
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,581
(by Japanese militarists to invade other countries.)

880
00:32:33,811 --> 00:32:37,479
(Many residents in Jeju were forced to work in the construction.)

881
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,051
(Jeju residents put to forced labor)

882
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:42,020
There are many like this.

883
00:32:42,021 --> 00:32:43,490
(A total of 20 hangars were built.)

884
00:32:43,761 --> 00:32:46,590
About 19 of them remain.

885
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:48,031
(19 hangars remain as dreary concrete structures.)

886
00:32:48,861 --> 00:32:52,000
Like a private garage,

887
00:32:52,001 --> 00:32:53,370
airplanes were kept here.

888
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,500
It protected from bombing.

889
00:32:55,501 --> 00:32:57,439
- It's a hangar.
- Hangar?

890
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,770
Is that what a hangar is?

891
00:32:58,771 --> 00:33:01,070
A hangar is where airplanes are stored.

892
00:33:01,071 --> 00:33:02,240
I see.

893
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,280
Is it shaped like this...

894
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:07,679
for the airplane wings?

895
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,081
You did some good research.

896
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:12,280
The body and the wings probably went in like this.

897
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:13,989
(Designed to fit an airplane)

898
00:33:13,990 --> 00:33:17,959
This is shaped like an arch.

899
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,260
- Right.
- To support a lot of weight.

900
00:33:19,261 --> 00:33:20,860
Yes, it supports a lot of weight.

901
00:33:20,861 --> 00:33:22,729
It wouldn't collapse no matter the pressure.

902
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:23,730
- Right.
- Arch.

903
00:33:23,731 --> 00:33:25,361
Did you know that there's an arch in our body?

904
00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:27,300
- Where's an arch in our body?
- I know.

905
00:33:27,301 --> 00:33:28,501
- Where?
- Our teeth.

906
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,739
Teeth?

907
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,199
That's a new thought.

908
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,870
Even if your front teeth get pushed,

909
00:33:33,871 --> 00:33:35,409
the molars support them.

910
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,010
You're right. It's shaped like an arch.

911
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,811
Actually, it's our feet.

912
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:41,880
Arch-shaped feet?

913
00:33:41,881 --> 00:33:44,719
Our feet get the most pressure in our body.

914
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,790
Is that why?

915
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:47,750
- I have flat feet, so it hurts.
- Flat feet.

916
00:33:47,751 --> 00:33:48,989
That's why my feet always hurt.

917
00:33:48,990 --> 00:33:50,620
- Do you have flat feet too?
- They tingle with pain.

918
00:33:50,621 --> 00:33:51,920
- Right.
- Exactly.

919
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:54,659
There are many arches in architecture.

920
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,929
It's because arches are the best at distributing weight.

921
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:01,299
Is this exactly from the past?

922
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:04,540
Of course. There was no hot plate in the past.

923
00:34:04,541 --> 00:34:06,569
There's a plate, a long piece of wood.

924
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:07,940
- Plates?
- Plates.

925
00:34:07,941 --> 00:34:09,739
Plates were attached...

926
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,610
to make a mold.

927
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:14,279
Do you see traces of the mold?

928
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,920
(Traces from the past still remain.)

929
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:18,751
That's how these traces were made.

930
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:21,650
This was made vertically,

931
00:34:21,651 --> 00:34:24,319
but you can see horizontal traces here.

932
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,191
- These are horizontal.
- Right.

933
00:34:28,461 --> 00:34:29,461
It's hard.

934
00:34:29,462 --> 00:34:32,901
It's a mix of rocks, rebar, and cement.

935
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,000
In the past,

936
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:37,340
they couldn't pour the concrete with a machine.

937
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:40,510
People carried and poured it here.

938
00:34:40,811 --> 00:34:44,440
Many people were forced into labor to build it.

939
00:34:44,441 --> 00:34:45,950
It couldn't be helped.

940
00:34:46,610 --> 00:34:50,219
Right now, in front of Mount Sanbang,

941
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,351
they're part of a beautiful scenery on Jeju Island.

942
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:56,489
It must have been very hard for the workers back then.

943
00:34:56,490 --> 00:34:58,121
The labor was intense, and they must've been sad.

944
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:03,700
(Traces of our painful history remains around the airfield.)

945
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:05,400
(Underground bunker from the Japanese colonial period)

946
00:35:05,401 --> 00:35:07,271
I've never seen an underground bunker before.

947
00:35:07,470 --> 00:35:10,000
On the outside, it doesn't look...

948
00:35:10,001 --> 00:35:11,440
like an underground bunker.

949
00:35:11,441 --> 00:35:13,339
It looks more like a ridge...

950
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,740
thanks to it being disguised with grass.

951
00:35:15,041 --> 00:35:16,909
The entrance looks spooky if you ask me.

952
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:18,881
- Can we enter?
- Yes, you may.

953
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,380
Where's the entrance?

954
00:35:20,381 --> 00:35:22,549
- We just walk inside.
- It's spooky, isn't it?

955
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:23,651
Straight ahead and to the left?

956
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,621
(Down the installed stairs)

957
00:35:27,621 --> 00:35:29,820
He's right. There's the entrance.

958
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,159
Is this how it was built?

959
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,990
(Beyond the entrance that one must crouch to fit through)

960
00:35:36,131 --> 00:35:38,561
- This...
- So this is how it is.

961
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,601
Goodness.

962
00:35:43,171 --> 00:35:44,200
This...

963
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:46,810
No way.

964
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:49,009
(Through the narrow hallway with thick walls of stone)

965
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,081
What's down there?

966
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,750
I've never been inside an underground bunker before.

967
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:53,811
It even has electricity.

968
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,480
There are arches down here as well.

969
00:35:55,481 --> 00:35:56,580
(The spacious inner space soon reveals itself.)

970
00:35:56,581 --> 00:35:58,950
This has been around for 70 to 80 years now.

971
00:35:58,981 --> 00:36:02,620
That's right. It was built in 1945, so it's been around for that long.

972
00:36:02,621 --> 00:36:03,790
This is fascinating.

973
00:36:03,791 --> 00:36:04,921
It's been around for about 70 years.

974
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:07,230
For about 30m...

975
00:36:07,231 --> 00:36:08,830
(Many assume it was used as a command post.)

976
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:11,061
The structure itself is incredible,

977
00:36:11,631 --> 00:36:12,800
but it makes my blood boil.

978
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:17,800
(Japan's ambition crumbled after losing the war.)

979
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:19,739
(It now remains as a ruin...)

980
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:23,780
(to teach us the value of peace.)

981
00:36:26,311 --> 00:36:27,780
It was built during the Japanese colonial period.

982
00:36:28,381 --> 00:36:31,021
It's easy to forget, but we must always remember.

983
00:36:31,621 --> 00:36:33,550
That's the point in history for us.

984
00:36:34,021 --> 00:36:35,750
- But now...
- Right.

985
00:36:35,751 --> 00:36:36,859
Right? We must...

986
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:39,020
- get on with the quiz.
- Of course.

987
00:36:39,021 --> 00:36:40,430
That's what I'm here for.

988
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,030
- I came to ace the quiz.
- Sure. Then...

989
00:36:43,131 --> 00:36:44,560
(Cuckoo)

990
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:45,630
What on earth?

991
00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:47,400
M Guesthouse.

992
00:36:47,401 --> 00:36:48,500
- Of course.
- What did I tell you?

993
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:49,540
It's as I said.

994
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,199
- They're doing as you expected.
- I was right.

995
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,940
- We'll follow your plan then.
- That's how we'll proceed.

996
00:36:52,941 --> 00:36:54,410
- We'll follow that path.
- That'll be our path.

997
00:36:54,771 --> 00:36:56,540
It would've felt better...

998
00:36:56,541 --> 00:36:58,140
- not to have used the nap card.
- I know.

999
00:36:58,381 --> 00:37:00,210
- It wasn't bad.
- It was nothing more than a nap.

1000
00:37:00,211 --> 00:37:02,049
- Jin wanted to be sure.
- Of course.

1001
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,520
- Okay.
- We need to get this right.

1002
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:04,521
(Time for Quiz)

1003
00:37:04,851 --> 00:37:08,220
Daejeong-eup on Jeju Island where Alddreu Airfield is located...

1004
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:09,790
was the place of exile...

1005
00:37:09,791 --> 00:37:12,190
for the master calligrapher...

1006
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:13,989
Kim "Chusa" Jeong Hui.

1007
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,930
Isn't it Kim "Chusa" Jeong Ho?

1008
00:37:16,061 --> 00:37:18,360
He's the man who drew the map.

1009
00:37:18,461 --> 00:37:21,171
Right. Kim Jeong Ho drew a map.

1010
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,530
I'm not entirely clueless though.

1011
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,469
Wasn't I the one who told you?

1012
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,139
Sorry about that.

1013
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,739
I studied the calligrapher.

1014
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:31,311
The picture "Winter Scene" which he drew while exiled...

1015
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:35,950
is 14.695m wide.

1016
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,351
- That's almost 15m.
- The width of it.

1017
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:42,990
However, when he first drew Winter Scene,

1018
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:46,290
it was only about 70cm wide.

1019
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:50,160
How did Winter Scene end up as wide as it is today?

1020
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,501
Show us the drawing.

1021
00:37:51,731 --> 00:37:54,770
This is the famous drawing named Winter Scene.

1022
00:37:54,771 --> 00:37:56,370
Hold on a second.

1023
00:37:56,371 --> 00:37:57,969
- How did it get wider?
- But...

1024
00:37:57,970 --> 00:38:00,310
Did you say it's now 14m?

1025
00:38:00,311 --> 00:38:03,080
It was extended and now it is 14.695m wide.

1026
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:04,540
It was originally 70cm,

1027
00:38:04,541 --> 00:38:07,310
- but it's now 1,400cm.
- That's right.

1028
00:38:07,311 --> 00:38:09,720
- It became wider and wider.
- Right.

1029
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:11,651
Why?

1030
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,251
It is now 20 times wider.

1031
00:38:13,421 --> 00:38:14,990
- Twenty times...
- That's what we must answer.

1032
00:38:15,021 --> 00:38:16,989
- Why?
- I must've guessed wrong.

1033
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:18,020
(That's what we must answer.)

1034
00:38:18,021 --> 00:38:19,389
(Thinking hard)

1035
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:22,291
If it's 14.695m wide,

1036
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,331
maybe he drew the components to match their real-life size.

1037
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,199
- Their real-life size.
- That's actually a good opinion.

1038
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,200
Their real-life size.

1039
00:38:30,201 --> 00:38:31,570
I saw this drawing, you see.

1040
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,710
I studied this.

1041
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:34,711
(Level 5 knowledge on Korean History is paying off.)

1042
00:38:34,712 --> 00:38:36,080
I studied it for the test...

1043
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:37,409
and I'm trying to remember the details.

1044
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,110
- I can't believe him.
- This drawing.

1045
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,910
I remember seeing it.

1046
00:38:41,151 --> 00:38:44,049
I saw this drawing. I remember this house...

1047
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,151
and this tree.

1048
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:48,950
(From tvN's "Bare Korean History")

1049
00:38:49,021 --> 00:38:51,589
(He saw it for sure.)

1050
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,331
(On top of that...)

1051
00:38:53,461 --> 00:38:57,199
(Winter Scene was transformed into an enormous piece of art...)

1052
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,800
(that is 14.7m wide.)

1053
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:02,740
(He even learned why it had widened.)

1054
00:39:03,101 --> 00:39:05,871
- Was there a reason?
- There was,

1055
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:07,441
but I can't quite put my finger on it.

1056
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,509
- Throw about some ideas.
- Let us hear your thoughts.

1057
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:11,610
- What do you think?
- Tell us what you think.

1058
00:39:12,711 --> 00:39:17,881
One of these trees symbolizes the artist.

1059
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:19,279
- The tree?
- Yes.

1060
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,191
Meanwhile, the rest...

1061
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:25,021
symbolizes his master, his family, or his children.

1062
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,990
- That's what they mean?
- Yes.

1063
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:31,130
The rest was added after he had died.

1064
00:39:31,131 --> 00:39:34,370
Either that or he drew more after his children died.

1065
00:39:34,371 --> 00:39:35,730
It's something like that.

1066
00:39:35,731 --> 00:39:36,870
(The drawing Kim Jeong Hui gifted to his apprentice)

1067
00:39:36,871 --> 00:39:38,000
(Some say the pine tree symbolizes Kim Jeong Hui himself.)

1068
00:39:38,001 --> 00:39:39,569
I think that's what I heard.

1069
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,670
Did he draw more as he had more children?

1070
00:39:41,671 --> 00:39:43,510
It's Kim "Chusa" Jeong Ho, right?

1071
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,139
- Kim Jeong Hui.
- Kim Jeong Hui?

1072
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,679
Kim Jeong Ho drew Map of the Great East.

1073
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:49,921
(They doubt him more and more.)

1074
00:39:50,050 --> 00:39:53,020
We have to answer why it was widened.

1075
00:39:53,021 --> 00:39:55,750
Maybe the paroma of Jeju...

1076
00:39:55,751 --> 00:39:57,290
- It's a panorama.
- Panorama.

1077
00:39:57,291 --> 00:39:58,659
Paroma is the name...

1078
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,890
of a brand.

1079
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:02,331
Right, a panorama. Let's say he drew more.

1080
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:05,001
Keep it vague and just say he drew more.

1081
00:40:05,461 --> 00:40:07,569
(Laughing)

1082
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:08,601
He drew more.

1083
00:40:08,871 --> 00:40:09,940
Is this how he's been answering questions...

1084
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:11,000
- on the show?
- Gosh, no.

1085
00:40:11,001 --> 00:40:12,400
We'll all get it right if that's allowed.

1086
00:40:12,401 --> 00:40:13,811
(Frustrated)

1087
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,739
- So...
- We must guess why.

1088
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:16,880
- He was exiled here.
- While he was exiled...

1089
00:40:16,881 --> 00:40:17,980
He drew a picture...

1090
00:40:17,981 --> 00:40:20,049
and wanted to make it better.

1091
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:23,420
He was exiled here and was probably bored,

1092
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,720
so he kept drawing.

1093
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,150
While in exile,

1094
00:40:27,151 --> 00:40:29,049
he kept drawing things that symbolized those he missed...

1095
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:30,920
which is how it got to be wider.

1096
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:32,421
- We'll go with that.
- I like that answer.

1097
00:40:32,590 --> 00:40:34,089
(What?)

1098
00:40:34,090 --> 00:40:35,589
- Okay?
- Yes, go with it.

1099
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:37,061
Okay. Here's our answer.

1100
00:40:38,001 --> 00:40:39,469
While in exile,

1101
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:43,370
he kept drawing things that symbolized those he missed...

1102
00:40:43,371 --> 00:40:44,969
which is how it got to be wider.

1103
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,670
(Drawing things that symbolized those he missed...)

1104
00:40:46,671 --> 00:40:47,671
That is incorrect.

1105
00:40:48,711 --> 00:40:49,811
Hold on.

1106
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,381
That...

1107
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:53,449
- Just like that?
- He wasn't even close.

1108
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:54,881
We'll use the reattempt card.

1109
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,319
Just like that?

1110
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,449
Your answer was romantic and quite impressive,

1111
00:40:58,450 --> 00:40:59,450
but it was wrong.

1112
00:40:59,451 --> 00:41:01,250
- We get a clue.
- Wasn't I even close?

1113
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:02,420
I hear the clue is the real deal.

1114
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:03,960
- It wasn't close at all.
- Really?

1115
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,820
- That's right.
- I shouldn't have picked him.

1116
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:06,890
Writing...

1117
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,461
Did he write something?

1118
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,130
Your clue is this. A two-syllable Korean word.

1119
00:41:11,131 --> 00:41:12,200
Comments.

1120
00:41:12,731 --> 00:41:13,800
Comments?

1121
00:41:14,601 --> 00:41:15,700
Give us more clues.

1122
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,200
How is "comments" a clue?

1123
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,470
- Give us more.
- Comments.

1124
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:21,739
- How is "comments" a clue?
- That isn't a clue.

1125
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,980
We're using our reattempt card on this.

1126
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,909
- Give us one that's definitive.
- Exactly.

1127
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,409
- It's my first time using this.
- I can't allow this.

1128
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,710
It's my first time using a reattempt card.

1129
00:41:27,711 --> 00:41:29,750
- Me too.
- I mean it.

1130
00:41:29,751 --> 00:41:31,250
How can it be definitive when I can't tell what it is?

1131
00:41:31,251 --> 00:41:33,049
I should know for it to be definitive.

1132
00:41:33,050 --> 00:41:35,020
- Aren't I right?
- He's right.

1133
00:41:35,021 --> 00:41:36,460
I still don't get it.

1134
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:38,359
The reattempt card is huge, but the clue wasn't that great.

1135
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,889
- Exactly.
- What does "comments" mean?

1136
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:42,461
- Show us.
- I don't get it at all.

1137
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:43,901
(Hold on...)

1138
00:41:43,902 --> 00:41:45,230
Comments on a masterpiece.

1139
00:41:45,231 --> 00:41:47,429
Maybe people wrote...

1140
00:41:47,430 --> 00:41:51,069
how they thought of the drawing next to it.

1141
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,871
- He was a calligrapher.
- Comments?

1142
00:41:53,271 --> 00:41:55,171
- Can we see it?
- Maybe it was scored.

1143
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,339
I can't show you that.

1144
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:59,080
That's right. If the handwriting is different...

1145
00:41:59,081 --> 00:42:00,310
How's this?

1146
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:03,179
More comments were written about the drawing...

1147
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:04,780
which is why it ended up 14.695m wide.

1148
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,150
That's our answer.

1149
00:42:06,151 --> 00:42:07,320
Are you all on board?

1150
00:42:07,521 --> 00:42:09,560
If we get it wrong, hash it out with the producer...

1151
00:42:09,561 --> 00:42:10,759
in the ring.

1152
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:11,820
Put him to sleep.

1153
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,530
I can put you to sleep and take a peek at the answer.

1154
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,830
(Sorry?)

1155
00:42:16,831 --> 00:42:17,831
What now?

1156
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:19,000
Have you made a decision?

1157
00:42:19,001 --> 00:42:21,000
- Shall we go with that?
- I think that's right.

1158
00:42:21,001 --> 00:42:23,339
- Comments?
- People commented...

1159
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,799
on the masterpiece,

1160
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:28,311
and because of all those comments, it ended up 14.695m wide.

1161
00:42:28,811 --> 00:42:30,080
- That is correct.
- Yes!

1162
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:31,810
(That is correct.)

1163
00:42:31,811 --> 00:42:33,550
See?

1164
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,750
I'm not even surprised. He practically gave us the answer.

1165
00:42:35,751 --> 00:42:36,779
I'm quite surprised.

1166
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,949
- He practically gave us the answer.
- You're right.

1167
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:40,421
I should've gone with that the first time.

1168
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,889
(Since they said the clue wasn't definitive)

1169
00:42:44,890 --> 00:42:48,830
(Allow us to present the commentary.)

1170
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:51,960
(You know how people write comments online.)

1171
00:42:51,961 --> 00:42:54,271
(Just like Dong Hyun heard the first time)

1172
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:57,840
(His apprentice Lee Sang Jeok took Winter Scene to China.)

1173
00:42:58,171 --> 00:43:01,941
(The writers in Qing commented on the picture.)

1174
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,950
(That's how the drawing ended up to be 14.695m wide.)

1175
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,150
(Because of this, )

1176
00:43:09,151 --> 00:43:10,981
(Kim "Chusa" Jeong Hui was a celebrity in China.)

1177
00:43:11,581 --> 00:43:13,620
- Alddreu Airfield.
- Airfield.

1178
00:43:13,621 --> 00:43:14,719
(Daejeong-eup, Seogwipo-si: Alddreu Airfield)

1179
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,719
(Daejeong-eup, Seogwipo-si: Alddreu Airfield)

1180
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:18,990
- Okay.
- We're good.

1181
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,730
- Let's see the meal we won.
- That was a tough one.

1182
00:43:21,731 --> 00:43:23,330
- What is it?
- Raw yellowtail.

1183
00:43:23,331 --> 00:43:25,259
- That'll be a healthy meal.
- Raw yellowtail.

1184
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,000
It'll be healthy. Raw yellowtail is in season.

1185
00:43:27,001 --> 00:43:29,231
- We'll eat that quite fast.
- You're good at defense, right?

1186
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,900
What? What do you mean?

1187
00:43:31,901 --> 00:43:33,270
- As in defense.
- Defense.

1188
00:43:33,271 --> 00:43:34,771
Oh, that.

1189
00:43:34,871 --> 00:43:36,139
Yes, I'm good at that.

1190
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:38,009
He's impossible to talk to,

1191
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:39,310
so how can we be a team?

1192
00:43:39,311 --> 00:43:40,880
Sorry about that.

1193
00:43:40,881 --> 00:43:42,449
Still, I strike hard when it is most needed.

1194
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:44,449
- We'll await that moment.
- Look forward to it.

1195
00:43:44,450 --> 00:43:46,449
- Be patient with me.
- That was a tough question.

1196
00:43:46,450 --> 00:43:48,650
- That was really hard.
- Let's get going for now.

1197
00:43:48,651 --> 00:43:49,690
We'll have raw yellowtail.

1198
00:43:49,691 --> 00:43:50,889
- Yes, let's have that.
- Come on.

1199
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:53,460
(They await the crucial punch and head out to eat raw yellowtail.)

1200
00:43:53,461 --> 00:43:55,590
(Team Guys)

1201
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:57,430
Your nap is over.

1202
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:00,600
(It's time to wake up from the nap.)

1203
00:44:00,601 --> 00:44:01,771
Seriously.

1204
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:04,570
I'm hungry.

1205
00:44:06,001 --> 00:44:07,110
Noodles in meat broth.

1206
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:09,211
- Let's have noodles in meat broth.
- Sure.

1207
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,481
If only they had put us to sleep after our meal.

1208
00:44:13,251 --> 00:44:15,151
Exactly. That would've been great.

1209
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,521
I might memorize the lyrics at this rate.

1210
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,390
Hasn't it been turned off? Am I hearing things?

1211
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,690
Four noodles in meat broth and a dish of dombe meat.

1212
00:44:25,691 --> 00:44:26,889
- Dombe meat, right.
- Thank you.

1213
00:44:26,890 --> 00:44:27,890
Thank you.

1214
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:30,460
The top bunk was more spacious.

1215
00:44:30,461 --> 00:44:32,100
They were able to both sleep up there.

1216
00:44:32,101 --> 00:44:34,770
Having that up there...

1217
00:44:34,771 --> 00:44:36,271
- kept it stable.
- Wasn't it stable?

1218
00:44:36,371 --> 00:44:37,500
That was a great idea.

1219
00:44:37,501 --> 00:44:38,639
(Cuckoo)

1220
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:39,770
- It was a great idea.
- They got it.

1221
00:44:39,771 --> 00:44:41,409
- Alddreu Airfield.
- Of course.

1222
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:43,340
I was wondering when we'd get the news.

1223
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:45,811
This is what they're going for.

1224
00:44:45,941 --> 00:44:47,780
Since they're here...

1225
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:50,150
(A possible bingo route for Team Handsome)

1226
00:44:50,151 --> 00:44:52,480
(1. The small triangle)

1227
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:55,150
(2. The big triangle)

1228
00:44:55,151 --> 00:44:56,190
They're all close by.

1229
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,989
They might go to Mokwoljae to block us.

1230
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:01,561
(3. Occupying one by one one their way up)

1231
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:05,929
It's difficult for us to win by completing the bingo.

1232
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:08,771
- You're right.
- In that case,

1233
00:45:08,930 --> 00:45:11,140
we have to win by occupying more squares.

1234
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,340
We have to hope that the other team will get some questions wrong.

1235
00:45:15,771 --> 00:45:17,311
- I see.
- Should we...

1236
00:45:18,041 --> 00:45:22,010
just go to the House of Mun Hyeong?

1237
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,251
It's close too.

1238
00:45:24,521 --> 00:45:26,319
Even if we want to block them,

1239
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:29,489
- we don't know where they'll go.
- We don't know their second spot.

1240
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:31,421
Let's occupy one square first.

1241
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:34,090
When they occupy a square while we do that,

1242
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:37,300
- We go to the next spot.
- we go and block them.

1243
00:45:37,461 --> 00:45:38,659
That's the only way.

1244
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,299
I think this is a good idea.

1245
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,470
But...

1246
00:45:41,671 --> 00:45:43,601
we lost, I think.

1247
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:45,900
- We lost.
- It's fair to say that.

1248
00:45:45,901 --> 00:45:47,339
- That's the only way.
- It's because...

1249
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:50,240
I'm sure they'll use the identification card.

1250
00:45:50,441 --> 00:45:51,610
They'll use it.

1251
00:45:51,811 --> 00:45:55,010
Then they'll try to fool us around until 7pm.

1252
00:45:55,110 --> 00:45:57,820
Then, instead of picking tangerines for 30 minutes,

1253
00:45:58,381 --> 00:46:00,121
let's do it for an hour.

1254
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,291
We can check out the Yongduam Rock.

1255
00:46:02,990 --> 00:46:04,990
And eat raw yellowtail with our own money.

1256
00:46:05,061 --> 00:46:06,460
Should I order soju, then?

1257
00:46:06,461 --> 00:46:08,290
Should I order it now?

1258
00:46:08,291 --> 00:46:10,061
But let's wait for this once.

1259
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,730
Let's wait until the second bingo move.

1260
00:46:12,731 --> 00:46:14,429
Let's check out the other team's strategy.

1261
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:16,870
We can go for a drive along the coastal road.

1262
00:46:16,871 --> 00:46:18,040
(We can go for a drive along the coastal road.)

1263
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:19,569
Let's check...

1264
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:23,041
- how Mun Hyeong Haeng used to live.
- Right.

1265
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:25,480
I think it's right for us to go to Mun Hyeong Haeng's house.

1266
00:46:25,481 --> 00:46:26,980
You should visit a traditional house...

1267
00:46:26,981 --> 00:46:28,510
- since you're on Jeju Island.
- That's right.

1268
00:46:28,711 --> 00:46:30,751
Just remember this.

1269
00:46:30,981 --> 00:46:32,780
We'll fill up our stomachs here,

1270
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:34,521
so when we get the question right in the House of Mun Hyeong Haeng,

1271
00:46:34,590 --> 00:46:36,561
we'll quickly have one serving of food and get going.

1272
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:38,160
You can't...

1273
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:40,331
go crazy again there. Okay?

1274
00:46:40,360 --> 00:46:41,360
Try it.

1275
00:46:41,361 --> 00:46:43,601
(Noodles in meat broth, dombe meat)

1276
00:46:44,131 --> 00:46:47,501
(You can fill up your stomachs here.)

1277
00:46:48,001 --> 00:46:50,240
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

1278
00:46:51,570 --> 00:46:52,840
(Savoring)

1279
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:56,510
(Savoring)

1280
00:46:58,711 --> 00:47:02,179
(Cleaning the palate with the side menu, dombe meat)

1281
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:04,651
(Greeting the noodles in meat broth)

1282
00:47:04,921 --> 00:47:07,089
They stayed until the party ended.

1283
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:09,350
(1st slurping)

1284
00:47:09,351 --> 00:47:10,719
(2nd slurping)

1285
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,760
(3rd slurping)

1286
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:16,561
(The giant youngest member can breathe as long as his height.)

1287
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:19,199
It's really good.

1288
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,271
(Hungry Seung Ho devours the noodles too.)

1289
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,340
It's good.

1290
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:31,880
It's really good.

1291
00:47:31,881 --> 00:47:33,109
(It's really good.)

1292
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:34,950
I craved for the noodles in meat broth.

1293
00:47:35,481 --> 00:47:37,550
You should have a bowl too.

1294
00:47:38,151 --> 00:47:39,779
We've lost already.

1295
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:40,791
(We've lost already.)

1296
00:47:40,851 --> 00:47:42,021
No. We don't know that yet.

1297
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,060
- Is it a gourmet tour now?
- Yes.

1298
00:47:44,061 --> 00:47:45,061
(They don't give up on the noodles.)

1299
00:47:47,390 --> 00:47:49,360
Each place is such a nice place.

1300
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:51,561
It'd be great to visit each one.

1301
00:47:51,831 --> 00:47:54,200
Ms. Roh, do you...

1302
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:56,271
have a place you want to go?

1303
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:58,441
Should we show you the spots?

1304
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,640
We can take you there, so just tell us.

1305
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,310
- We have these spots.
- We can go there,

1306
00:48:02,311 --> 00:48:04,041
try to solve questions together,

1307
00:48:04,541 --> 00:48:06,180
and eat whatever you want.

1308
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:09,380
I'd love that. I'd love to go to the House of Mun Hyeong Haeng.

1309
00:48:09,381 --> 00:48:10,650
- Mun Hyeong Haeng.
- It's a great place.

1310
00:48:10,651 --> 00:48:13,390
Should we go to Mun Hyeong Haeng's house, then?

1311
00:48:13,791 --> 00:48:15,190
- Let's go there.
- Go.

1312
00:48:15,191 --> 00:48:17,490
(When Team Guys is about to be done with their meal...)

1313
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:18,990
This has to be good.

1314
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:21,590
It smells awesome.

1315
00:48:21,731 --> 00:48:22,930
First...

1316
00:48:23,061 --> 00:48:24,930
Should we order various dishes since we're hungry?

1317
00:48:25,401 --> 00:48:26,560
Raw yellowtail...

1318
00:48:26,561 --> 00:48:27,700
I want brown turban shells.

1319
00:48:28,231 --> 00:48:29,430
(Laughing)

1320
00:48:29,530 --> 00:48:31,069
Come on. We have to eat quickly...

1321
00:48:31,070 --> 00:48:33,440
- and leave.
- We have to eat quickly and leave.

1322
00:48:33,441 --> 00:48:34,910
But can you refrain from eating abalone porridge?

1323
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:37,441
- Abalone porridge?
- Come on.

1324
00:48:37,811 --> 00:48:39,981
- Sea urchin bibimbap?
- Grilled yellowtail head.

1325
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,211
Braised hairtail!

1326
00:48:41,751 --> 00:48:44,381
- Won't mulhoe be good?
- It'd be great.

1327
00:48:44,651 --> 00:48:46,719
Okay. Let's order dishes that come out fast.

1328
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:47,850
We have to order it now.

1329
00:48:47,851 --> 00:48:50,060
Ma'am, what would go well with raw yellowtail?

1330
00:48:50,061 --> 00:48:51,759
We'll order what you recommend.

1331
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:53,490
Whatever that'll come out fast.

1332
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:54,929
Braised hairtail.

1333
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:57,199
- We'll get the braised hairtail.
- Yes. We'll order that.

1334
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,271
And we'll order two soup dishes that will come out fast.

1335
00:49:00,570 --> 00:49:02,630
Two soup dishes that will come out fast.

1336
00:49:02,631 --> 00:49:04,970
The raw fish comes with a clear stew.

1337
00:49:05,041 --> 00:49:07,170
- That's good.
- That's enough.

1338
00:49:07,171 --> 00:49:08,739
- Please cook...
- We'll order raw yellowtail...

1339
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:10,311
- the braised hairtail quickly.
- and braised hairtail.

1340
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,041
Did you get the question right?

1341
00:49:12,510 --> 00:49:13,549
We barely got it right.

1342
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:14,981
- Right.
- What was the question?

1343
00:49:15,050 --> 00:49:18,549
It was about Kim "Chusa" Jeong Hui who was exiled...

1344
00:49:18,550 --> 00:49:19,850
to Daejeong-eup.

1345
00:49:19,851 --> 00:49:21,049
Yes. I know him.

1346
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:22,819
I was going to tell you about him, but I didn't.

1347
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:24,120
You should have.

1348
00:49:24,121 --> 00:49:25,690
His home in exile is near here.

1349
00:49:25,691 --> 00:49:27,060
- That's right.
- Hear me out.

1350
00:49:27,061 --> 00:49:28,230
He drew a painting.

1351
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:30,000
"Winter Scene," you know it, right?

1352
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:31,700
It has all those comments on it.

1353
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,930
It has all those comments on it.

1354
00:49:34,231 --> 00:49:35,401
That's exactly right.

1355
00:49:35,631 --> 00:49:37,270
- You should...
- You should have told us that.

1356
00:49:37,271 --> 00:49:38,739
The exhibition... Hold on.

1357
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,270
I didn't tell you because it had nothing to do with the place.

1358
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:41,811
From now on,

1359
00:49:41,871 --> 00:49:43,880
- you can tell us everything.
- Yes.

1360
00:49:43,881 --> 00:49:45,139
- Just tell us.
- Right.

1361
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,949
- We have to win.
- We do.

1362
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:48,811
- Nothing else matters.
- I'm here to win today.

1363
00:49:48,881 --> 00:49:50,279
Let's complete bingo today.

1364
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:51,880
(Let's complete bingo today.)

1365
00:49:51,881 --> 00:49:52,950
For the first time.

1366
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,421
You made the bingo on the first filming.

1367
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:56,990
When did I?

1368
00:49:57,720 --> 00:49:59,960
- You did it on the first show.
- You just forget about everything.

1369
00:49:59,961 --> 00:50:01,159
Wait. Did I do it on the first shoot?

1370
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:02,160
This is what I love about him.

1371
00:50:02,161 --> 00:50:03,699
- He doesn't stay in the past.
- Right.

1372
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,199
- I only think about the future.
- Gosh.

1373
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,569
I've gotten the power to foresee, instead of remembering.

1374
00:50:07,570 --> 00:50:08,570
The power to foresee.

1375
00:50:08,571 --> 00:50:09,699
- It's high.
- His memory is...

1376
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:11,839
- similar to mine.
- You don't remember either?

1377
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:13,739
- I forget about everything.
- I'm serious too.

1378
00:50:13,740 --> 00:50:15,040
Seriously. I only think about the future.

1379
00:50:15,041 --> 00:50:16,881
- I forget them all after a sleep.
- That's right.

1380
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:18,940
I learned about Chusa before.

1381
00:50:18,941 --> 00:50:20,049
(Sad)

1382
00:50:20,050 --> 00:50:21,880
- The food is here.
- Okay.

1383
00:50:21,881 --> 00:50:24,151
Let's focus on the food when we're eating.

1384
00:50:24,450 --> 00:50:26,280
- What is this?
- It's the raw yellowtail.

1385
00:50:26,521 --> 00:50:27,851
It's raw yellowtail, right?

1386
00:50:30,291 --> 00:50:34,131
(Raw yellowtail is looking tasty as it's in season.)

1387
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,500
The braised hairtail comes out fast.

1388
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:39,601
(Tasty braised hairtail came out fast, indeed.)

1389
00:50:42,731 --> 00:50:44,069
- Is it sea urchin bibimbap?
- I can't believe...

1390
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:45,371
I'm having sea urchin bibimbap.

1391
00:50:45,541 --> 00:50:48,440
(It's time to enjoy a generous meal of Jeju Island.)

1392
00:50:48,441 --> 00:50:50,310
You can take a piece of raw yellowtail first.

1393
00:50:50,311 --> 00:50:51,779
- Let's eat.
- I'll take one first, then.

1394
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,651
- We'll eat after you.
- Thanks for the food.

1395
00:50:54,711 --> 00:50:55,981
Please enjoy the food.

1396
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,850
- Please enjoy the food.
- Please enjoy the food.

1397
00:50:57,851 --> 00:50:58,949
It's tasty.

1398
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:00,351
It has to be good.

1399
00:51:00,521 --> 00:51:02,151
The raw yellowtail tastes the best around this time.

1400
00:51:02,490 --> 00:51:04,291
(Savoring)

1401
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:06,389
It's different, for sure.

1402
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:07,831
- It's good.
- It's really good.

1403
00:51:08,831 --> 00:51:11,000
- Give it to me. I'll mix it.
- It's all done.

1404
00:51:11,001 --> 00:51:12,230
- It's done.
- You should eat.

1405
00:51:12,231 --> 00:51:14,070
- It's done. Take a scoop.
- I'll mix it.

1406
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,401
- Enjoy, Dong Hyun.
- Okay.

1407
00:51:17,271 --> 00:51:18,740
Gosh. The raw fish is insanely good.

1408
00:51:19,871 --> 00:51:21,240
- It's so good, Dong Hyun.
- Gosh.

1409
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:23,139
(This time, he eats with dried laver that goes well with it.)

1410
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:24,609
- It's different.
- I'll take one.

1411
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:25,711
The raw fish is great.

1412
00:51:28,381 --> 00:51:29,679
(He's angry because it tastes so good.)

1413
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,819
Is it crazy?

1414
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,481
Wrap it with the dried laver.

1415
00:51:37,061 --> 00:51:38,160
Gosh. It's amazing.

1416
00:51:38,820 --> 00:51:41,790
The raw yellowfish is light and fatty.

1417
00:51:41,791 --> 00:51:43,231
- It has a good texture.
- Yes.

1418
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:45,300
- It's very good.
- It's soft.

1419
00:51:46,131 --> 00:51:47,630
The raw yellowtail is amazing.

1420
00:51:47,631 --> 00:51:48,930
The raw yellowtail is awesome.

1421
00:51:53,510 --> 00:51:55,569
(Worldwide Handsome eats particularly well.)

1422
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,081
- It's pretty good.
- It's great.

1423
00:51:57,981 --> 00:51:59,041
Is it good?

1424
00:52:00,981 --> 00:52:03,680
The braised hairtail is seasoned to perfection.

1425
00:52:03,921 --> 00:52:05,820
Jin, didn't you say you already had breakfast?

1426
00:52:06,351 --> 00:52:07,589
It's lunchtime now.

1427
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,489
(It's lunchtime now.)

1428
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:12,960
(Eating well)

1429
00:52:12,961 --> 00:52:14,259
Gosh. The clear stew is here.

1430
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,060
- Things keep coming.
- You can give it to me.

1431
00:52:16,061 --> 00:52:17,061
(Before they know it, the last clear stew is here too.)

1432
00:52:17,062 --> 00:52:18,160
The clear stew.

1433
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:25,700
(He's angry again.)

1434
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:29,240
Gosh. The clear stew is refreshing too.

1435
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:36,711
(The hardcore soup lover goes crazy.)

1436
00:52:38,021 --> 00:52:39,081
This is...

1437
00:52:39,651 --> 00:52:42,351
Gosh. I can't believe clear stew can be this good.

1438
00:52:42,950 --> 00:52:44,061
Let's use the card now.

1439
00:52:44,461 --> 00:52:46,621
No. We have to use it in the car before we leave.

1440
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:47,990
I don't think we should use it.

1441
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:50,359
(Laughing)

1442
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,061
Why are you always in a disagreement?

1443
00:52:52,731 --> 00:52:53,970
We really don't have to use it.

1444
00:52:54,030 --> 00:52:57,040
(Well...)

1445
00:52:57,041 --> 00:52:58,300
You're not thinking, are you?

1446
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,311
I'm thinking about whether I should get one more dish.

1447
00:53:00,711 --> 00:53:03,440
(Only the food matters for him.)

1448
00:53:03,441 --> 00:53:04,710
Raw fish bibimbap?

1449
00:53:04,711 --> 00:53:06,279
- Raw fish bibimbap? Sounds good.
- Raw fish bibimbap.

1450
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:07,750
- Raw fish bibimbap?
- Raw fish bibimbap?

1451
00:53:07,751 --> 00:53:08,810
We'll get one raw fish bibimbap.

1452
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,010
Yes. I guess we'll get one.

1453
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:12,850
- The raw fish bibimbap is here.
- Thank you.

1454
00:53:12,851 --> 00:53:13,950
(Adding raw fish bibimbap to the list)

1455
00:53:14,421 --> 00:53:15,520
It's so tasty.

1456
00:53:15,521 --> 00:53:17,191
(They killed the raw fish bibimbap too.)

1457
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:19,090
That was great. It was good, right?

1458
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:20,631
I loved it.

1459
00:53:20,731 --> 00:53:22,060
It was very satisfying.

1460
00:53:22,061 --> 00:53:23,160
(It was very satisfying.)

1461
00:53:23,191 --> 00:53:25,200
Are we going to use the identification card here?

1462
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,299
We'll get into the car, so let's use it now.

1463
00:53:27,300 --> 00:53:28,501
But when we use it now,

1464
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:30,170
- I'm certain.
- we're using all three cards...

1465
00:53:30,171 --> 00:53:31,440
after visiting one place.

1466
00:53:31,441 --> 00:53:33,139
Is the other team closer to Mokwoljae...

1467
00:53:33,140 --> 00:53:34,909
than us or not?

1468
00:53:34,910 --> 00:53:37,041
- That's all we need to know.
- They're closer.

1469
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:38,909
I'm sure they're almost there...

1470
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:41,310
or solving the question right now.

1471
00:53:41,311 --> 00:53:42,980
Listen. If they are not doing the bingo,

1472
00:53:42,981 --> 00:53:45,320
- they can occupy all these spots.
- That can be possible.

1473
00:53:47,021 --> 00:53:48,251
- Right.
- Use the card.

1474
00:53:48,490 --> 00:53:49,589
Let's use the card.

1475
00:53:49,590 --> 00:53:50,590
- Should we use it?
- After hearing what you said...

1476
00:53:50,591 --> 00:53:51,960
What is your opinion?

1477
00:53:51,961 --> 00:53:54,029
- He makes sense.
- It does, right?

1478
00:53:54,030 --> 00:53:55,060
We'll use the card.

1479
00:53:55,061 --> 00:53:56,061
Then,

1480
00:53:56,062 --> 00:53:58,859
we'll use the identification card.

1481
00:53:58,860 --> 00:54:00,470
You have to tell us where they are exactly.

1482
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:02,569
- It's here.
- Where are they?

1483
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,270
(What is the current location of Team Guys?)

1484
00:54:04,271 --> 00:54:06,069
- Dong Hyun, I told you.
- What?

1485
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:08,040
You're wrong about everything.

1486
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:09,940
- They are going this way.
- Really?

1487
00:54:09,941 --> 00:54:12,041
- Where are they again?
- Here.

1488
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,009
This means they'll focus on occupying more squares,

1489
00:54:14,010 --> 00:54:15,509
instead of playing bingo.

1490
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:16,881
- They want to block us.
- Right.

1491
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:19,219
If they are blocking us...

1492
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,819
- They go around to block us.
- In that case,

1493
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:22,449
we have to go to close spots first.

1494
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:24,790
We can go to Mokwoljae and occupy all these spots.

1495
00:54:24,791 --> 00:54:26,061
No. Why are we going Mokwoljae?

1496
00:54:26,961 --> 00:54:28,659
- You decide.
- No.

1497
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,089
- I'm just saying.
- No.

1498
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:32,199
- Let's hear from Jin now.
- Listen.

1499
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:33,600
- Listen.
- No. You decide.

1500
00:54:33,601 --> 00:54:34,699
- Come on.
- No.

1501
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:35,770
We're one team. Come on.

1502
00:54:35,771 --> 00:54:37,639
- Look. Take a seat.
- Why?

1503
00:54:37,640 --> 00:54:40,441
- Leader can't be sulking.
- They've occupied this spot.

1504
00:54:40,941 --> 00:54:43,040
If we occupy V Garden first,

1505
00:54:43,041 --> 00:54:44,839
they can't complete bingo.

1506
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:46,840
Isn't V Garden the worst choice?

1507
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:48,710
Why suddenly do we go to...

1508
00:54:48,711 --> 00:54:50,881
- Did you say it's the worst choice?
- It's because...

1509
00:54:50,950 --> 00:54:52,820
Wait. We go to the V Garden from here?

1510
00:54:52,881 --> 00:54:54,020
If we go to the Ctesiphon House...

1511
00:54:54,021 --> 00:54:55,151
- first, - And that's okay with you?

1512
00:54:55,220 --> 00:54:56,719
- we can come here.
- That's right.

1513
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:58,190
But if we occupy here...

1514
00:54:58,191 --> 00:54:59,589
They'll block us here. Let's go to the closer one...

1515
00:54:59,590 --> 00:55:00,590
If we occupy Mokwoljae...

1516
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:01,590
So, if we occupy Mokwoljae...

1517
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:03,460
(Bored)

1518
00:55:03,461 --> 00:55:05,929
(Doing this for 10 minutes)

1519
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,170
If we occupy this spot...

1520
00:55:07,171 --> 00:55:09,671
We can occupy that spot too? I don't think we have time.

1521
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:11,370
You do it.

1522
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:13,441
- Do what you want.
- No. Let's try it.

1523
00:55:13,570 --> 00:55:15,310
Let's do the opposite of what I said. That would work.

1524
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:16,409
- Really?
- I'll trust you.

1525
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:17,580
Yes. To the V Garden.

1526
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:18,679
- Let's go now.
- Hold on.

1527
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,739
- We have a long way to go.
- This...

1528
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,480
can be a brilliant move.

1529
00:55:21,481 --> 00:55:23,381
The other team will block that spot anyway.

1530
00:55:23,651 --> 00:55:26,621
If we occupy this spot, we block their every move.

1531
00:55:27,291 --> 00:55:28,989
- That might be easier for us.
- They will be surprised.

1532
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:31,120
No. Bangju Church might be a better choice...

1533
00:55:31,121 --> 00:55:33,061
- when I think about it again.
- When we go there...

1534
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,890
It's such an obvious move.

1535
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:37,360
That's true.

1536
00:55:38,030 --> 00:55:39,160
Do whatever you please.

1537
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,270
- Do whatever you please.
- What?

1538
00:55:41,271 --> 00:55:43,070
No. Our leader should decide.

1539
00:55:43,171 --> 00:55:44,339
- "Leader." - Come on.

1540
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,540
- Jin is...
- He calls me a leader now.

1541
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:48,109
Okay. It's either Bangju Church or the V Garden.

1542
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:49,170
- What should we do?
- Let's go to the V Garden!

1543
00:55:49,171 --> 00:55:50,211
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

1544
00:55:50,711 --> 00:55:51,940
I'll play for the V Garden.

1545
00:55:51,941 --> 00:55:53,340
What about you? You play for Bangju Church, right?

1546
00:55:54,251 --> 00:55:55,381
I play for the Ctesiphon House.

1547
00:55:56,450 --> 00:55:57,450
(Laughing)

1548
00:55:58,050 --> 00:56:00,520
- You're trying to be funny.
- I'm not.

1549
00:56:00,521 --> 00:56:03,021
- He's trying to be funny.
- I'm not.

1550
00:56:03,121 --> 00:56:04,790
I have to choose something else.

1551
00:56:04,791 --> 00:56:06,590
I told you to choose between the two.

1552
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:08,659
You two do the rock-paper-scissors. I'm okay with both.

1553
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,561
- What do you want to do?
- You two play it.

1554
00:56:10,731 --> 00:56:11,859
You shouldn't give up now.

1555
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:13,100
- Hurry.
- Hurry and do it.

1556
00:56:13,101 --> 00:56:14,299
Whoever wins, we'll go to that place.

1557
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:15,529
Why are you getting out of it?

1558
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:16,670
I'll play for the Bangju Church.

1559
00:56:16,671 --> 00:56:18,040
- You two play for the Church.
- I'll play for the V Garden.

1560
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,800
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

1561
00:56:19,941 --> 00:56:22,370
- The V Garden.
- The V Garden. Let's go.

1562
00:56:22,371 --> 00:56:23,469
Let's go, the V Garden!

1563
00:56:23,470 --> 00:56:25,240
- I want to go to the Bangju Church.
- Me too.

1564
00:56:26,541 --> 00:56:28,350
- Should we go there?
- Let's go to the Bangju Church.

1565
00:56:28,351 --> 00:56:29,880
- Let's go to the Bangju Church.
- Hurry.

1566
00:56:29,881 --> 00:56:30,881
Come on.

1567
00:56:31,121 --> 00:56:32,719
That's the place I wanted to go in the first place.

1568
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,319
- You said the Ctesiphon House.
- Stop insisting.

1569
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,020
I mentioned the church first, but you wanted the V Garden.

1570
00:56:37,021 --> 00:56:38,259
Are we going to keep fighting here?

1571
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,290
Dong Hyun, why are you so indecisive?

1572
00:56:40,291 --> 00:56:41,859
In the end, we're doing what I said.

1573
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:44,199
(Team Handsome's next destination is the Bangju Church!)

1574
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,961
(Team Guys)

1575
00:56:47,501 --> 00:56:50,371
The House of Mun Hyeong Haeng. It doesn't make sense, though.

1576
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:52,901
It's a random move.

1577
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:56,840
In the game of Go, Lee Se Dol...

1578
00:56:57,581 --> 00:57:00,180
made a strange move and made AlphaGo have an error.

1579
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:01,410
"What is this?"

1580
00:57:02,251 --> 00:57:03,711
We're just moving along now.

1581
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,819
We're going there because it's close.

1582
00:57:05,820 --> 00:57:07,719
(Team Guys are in a happy mood.)

1583
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,219
We can call it a day and get some rest...

1584
00:57:09,220 --> 00:57:11,260
and pile the stonewall hard tomorrow.

1585
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,659
(A bitter ending)

1586
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,360
We don't know what will happen.

1587
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:19,529
When I heard we were going to Jeju Island,

1588
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:21,029
I thought of questions they'd ask about.

1589
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:22,400
About Mount Halla, black pork...

1590
00:57:22,401 --> 00:57:24,700
- horse...
- Mount Halla and dol hareubang.

1591
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,771
I thought it'd be the Jeju dialect.

1592
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:28,441
- The dialect.
- The dialect.

1593
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:30,140
That's possible.

1594
00:57:31,340 --> 00:57:33,949
I should look up the quiz on the Jeju dialect.

1595
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:35,010
Eomeong, abang.

1596
00:57:35,450 --> 00:57:37,621
- Mother and father.
- Mother and father.

1597
00:57:38,021 --> 00:57:40,351
I heard them from "Our Blues."

1598
00:57:41,121 --> 00:57:42,151
Ddol?

1599
00:57:42,621 --> 00:57:43,651
Daughter.

1600
00:57:43,791 --> 00:57:45,090
- Is ddol a daughter?
- Yes.

1601
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,961
- Yomangjida.
- Cute.

1602
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,660
It's being smart.

1603
00:57:50,530 --> 00:57:51,731
It's being smart.

1604
00:57:52,030 --> 00:57:53,030
Silpakhada.

1605
00:57:53,031 --> 00:57:54,299
(The next question is silpakhada.)

1606
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,300
Skinny.

1607
00:57:55,771 --> 00:57:57,501
- Fat.
- What?

1608
00:57:59,001 --> 00:58:00,100
It's so hard.

1609
00:58:00,101 --> 00:58:02,371
Gamjeo. Does it mean to thank?

1610
00:58:02,711 --> 00:58:04,180
- A mask?
- To go?

1611
00:58:04,941 --> 00:58:05,981
It's sweet potato.

1612
00:58:06,881 --> 00:58:08,410
Gamjeo is a sweet potato.

1613
00:58:08,711 --> 00:58:10,010
I'll fold. I surrender.

1614
00:58:10,881 --> 00:58:11,950
It's so hard.

1615
00:58:12,881 --> 00:58:14,489
(While getting lost in incomprehensible Jeju dialect...)

1616
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:16,320
It's so hard. It's impossible to get it right.

1617
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:19,660
Okay. We're here.

1618
00:58:20,021 --> 00:58:21,090
Are we?

1619
00:58:23,331 --> 00:58:30,541
(The House of Mun Hyeong Haeng)

1620
00:58:31,001 --> 00:58:32,040
Mun Hyeong Haeng.

1621
00:58:32,041 --> 00:58:35,010
(Handsome Heritage 3: Welcome to the House of Jeju)

1622
00:58:36,711 --> 00:58:40,280
(The cozy stonewall path welcomes them.)

1623
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:44,851
(The trees over the path are heavy with tangerines.)

1624
00:58:45,421 --> 00:58:47,549
Gosh. I like it here. It's serene.

1625
00:58:47,550 --> 00:58:49,520
(It's filled with the serene vibe of Jeju Island.)

1626
00:58:49,521 --> 00:58:51,121
Gosh. Look at the tree.

1627
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:53,090
It's so big.

1628
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:54,731
What?

1629
00:58:55,530 --> 00:58:56,989
- Welcome.
- We meet again.

1630
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:58,360
(Roh Eun Joo will join them again.)

1631
00:58:58,831 --> 00:59:02,370
You'll see a traditional private house on Jeju Island.

1632
00:59:02,371 --> 00:59:03,770
- A private house.
- A private house. Okay.

1633
00:59:03,771 --> 00:59:05,970
How does it differ from the houses on land?

1634
00:59:06,140 --> 00:59:07,811
Aren't these the differences?

1635
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:09,210
- Stonewall.
- They have stonewalls.

1636
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:10,470
- Stonewalls.
- Stonewalls.

1637
00:59:10,740 --> 00:59:13,639
(Jeju's traditional house features 1: Stonewall)

1638
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,549
The path we've taken...

1639
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:17,981
- We walked a bit off the main road.
- Yes.

1640
00:59:18,251 --> 00:59:19,880
These paths are the Olle Trail.

1641
00:59:19,881 --> 00:59:21,020
(The path they've walked on is the Olle Trail.)

1642
00:59:21,021 --> 00:59:22,989
From the main road to one's house,

1643
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:26,290
there's a path that's less windy and more protective.

1644
00:59:26,291 --> 00:59:27,990
That's the Olle Trail.

1645
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:30,089
That's what's called the Olle Trail.

1646
00:59:30,090 --> 00:59:31,360
(The stonewall was built around the house.)

1647
00:59:31,660 --> 00:59:33,401
It's so sturdy.

1648
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:36,430
Do they stick well together because they are basalt?

1649
00:59:36,901 --> 00:59:38,569
- The surface is rough, - It's rough.

1650
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:40,810
So with its friction, it holds together.

1651
00:59:40,811 --> 00:59:42,240
Let's go into the house now.

1652
00:59:42,570 --> 00:59:44,080
- This place is...
- It's a thatched house.

1653
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:46,080
- The House of Mun Hyeong Haeng.
- The House of Mun Hyeong Haeng.

1654
00:59:46,081 --> 00:59:47,279
(The House of Mun Hyeong Haeng)

1655
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:48,650
(A traditional Jeju house in Haga-ri, Aewol-eup, Jeju-si)

1656
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:49,980
(It's a folklore material that shows the housing of Jeju well.)

1657
00:59:49,981 --> 00:59:51,449
(It was selected as a National Folklore Cultural Heritage in 2021.)

1658
00:59:51,450 --> 00:59:53,151
You see some buildings.

1659
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:56,089
The first one you see is a cowshed.

1660
00:59:56,090 --> 00:59:58,359
- A cowshed.
- Yes. It's a cowshed.

1661
00:59:58,360 --> 00:59:59,489
- A cowshed.
- Yes.

1662
00:59:59,490 --> 01:00:01,759
This is a cowshed.

1663
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,101
There are two houses now.

1664
01:00:04,530 --> 01:00:05,929
This is the angeori,

1665
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:07,100
- the inner house.
- The inner house.

1666
01:00:07,101 --> 01:00:09,170
This is the bakgeori, the outer house.

1667
01:00:09,171 --> 01:00:10,639
(Inner house: Where the parents' live)

1668
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,171
(Outer house: Where their children live)

1669
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:14,909
(When the parents get old and about to retire, )

1670
01:00:14,910 --> 01:00:16,739
(they change the house with their children.)

1671
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,480
(It means the leader of the household...)

1672
01:00:18,481 --> 01:00:20,310
(has changed.)

1673
01:00:20,311 --> 01:00:21,949
The difference between the inner and the outer house is...

1674
01:00:21,950 --> 01:00:25,120
The people of Jeju Island...

1675
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,719
find independence crucial.

1676
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:27,890
Is that so?

1677
01:00:28,121 --> 01:00:30,620
For example, let's say their son gets married.

1678
01:00:30,621 --> 01:00:32,259
When their son gets married,

1679
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:34,830
other parents want their daughter-in-law to cook.

1680
01:00:34,831 --> 01:00:36,791
They don't have such a thing here.

1681
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:39,259
- I see.
- The inner house takes care...

1682
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,000
of the inner house business.

1683
01:00:41,001 --> 01:00:42,001
Really?

1684
01:00:42,002 --> 01:00:43,569
The outer house takes care of their business themselves.

1685
01:00:43,570 --> 01:00:45,800
- They're separate houses, then.
- They are totally separated.

1686
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,810
Do they have separate kitchens?

1687
01:00:47,811 --> 01:00:50,110
Yes. Their economic activities are totally separated too.

1688
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:53,811
They usually have separate kitchens.

1689
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:56,009
Since this house is small,

1690
01:00:56,010 --> 01:00:58,251
this building only has a room and the floor.

1691
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,049
That one has the room, the floor, and the kitchen.

1692
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:02,090
(Kitchen, floor, room)

1693
01:01:02,251 --> 01:01:03,490
- Kitchen.
- That's the kitchen door.

1694
01:01:03,890 --> 01:01:05,589
Even in this case,

1695
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:07,290
the daughter-in-law doesn't cook for both families.

1696
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:08,560
They use two caldrons.

1697
01:01:08,561 --> 01:01:10,560
(They use two caldrons.)

1698
01:01:10,561 --> 01:01:12,699
Each one uses theirs separately.

1699
01:01:12,700 --> 01:01:14,529
Even if they share the space,

1700
01:01:14,530 --> 01:01:17,371
they cook their own food.

1701
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:18,570
That's interesting.

1702
01:01:18,571 --> 01:01:21,040
What is the culture behind it...

1703
01:01:21,041 --> 01:01:22,910
that they do such a thing?

1704
01:01:23,041 --> 01:01:24,481
Is it for the daughter-in-law to get married comfortably?

1705
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:26,409
Or since it's an island,

1706
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:28,351
the daughters-in-law will leave if they don't do that?

1707
01:01:28,981 --> 01:01:31,120
- They'd go to the mainland?
- They try...

1708
01:01:31,121 --> 01:01:34,950
their best so that they won't abandon the family.

1709
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:37,589
That's part of it, but in Jeju Island,

1710
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:39,190
women are more in charge of livelihood.

1711
01:01:39,191 --> 01:01:40,760
Take haenyeo, for example.

1712
01:01:41,191 --> 01:01:43,929
(As men went off the Island to work, )

1713
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:47,060
(Jeju women took care of the livelihood.)

1714
01:01:47,061 --> 01:01:49,200
For a very long time,

1715
01:01:49,501 --> 01:01:52,901
they consider women's independence very important.

1716
01:01:53,601 --> 01:01:55,339
(Understanding)

1717
01:01:55,340 --> 01:01:56,410
I see.

1718
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,381
What is this?

1719
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:00,850
It's called poongchae, which is used to avoid rain.

1720
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:02,350
(Jeju's traditional house features 3: Poongchae)

1721
01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:03,779
(A narrow roof at the eaves end to prevent rain from coming in)

1722
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:04,819
Because it's windy,

1723
01:02:04,820 --> 01:02:06,980
the rain can come in.

1724
01:02:06,981 --> 01:02:08,250
- That's why they have it.
- Yes.

1725
01:02:08,251 --> 01:02:11,460
If they need to, they remove the sticks that are holding it.

1726
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:13,259
When they come down,

1727
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:14,460
- the house is protected.
- They pull it down.

1728
01:02:14,461 --> 01:02:16,089
It's like a cover.

1729
01:02:16,090 --> 01:02:18,029
(Interested)

1730
01:02:18,030 --> 01:02:19,259
There's an interesting thing...

1731
01:02:19,260 --> 01:02:20,461
- over there.
- What is it?

1732
01:02:20,631 --> 01:02:22,001
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1733
01:02:22,501 --> 01:02:23,529
What? What is this?

1734
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:26,500
That's wooyoung, the garden I told you about.

1735
01:02:26,501 --> 01:02:28,671
Next to the garden is...

1736
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:30,339
What? There's something over here.

1737
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:32,110
There's something deep inside.

1738
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,739
- What is this?
- Is it a well or something?

1739
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:34,780
What could this be?

1740
01:02:34,851 --> 01:02:37,110
- What is this?
- What is this?

1741
01:02:37,410 --> 01:02:39,121
There's a hole in it.

1742
01:02:39,550 --> 01:02:41,521
They did something here.

1743
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:45,320
I know what this place is.

1744
01:02:45,890 --> 01:02:47,191
The place to wash up.

1745
01:02:47,421 --> 01:02:48,659
- Isn't it a place to wash?
- A place to wash?

1746
01:02:48,660 --> 01:02:50,430
- You can't fill up the water here.
- Like a bath?

1747
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:53,061
You'll know when you look closely.

1748
01:02:53,401 --> 01:02:54,570
Should I look closely?

1749
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,740
(We'll look very closely.)

1750
01:03:00,271 --> 01:03:02,171
You'll know when you look closely.

1751
01:03:03,211 --> 01:03:04,211
It's a toilet.

1752
01:03:04,640 --> 01:03:06,081
- What?
- No way.

1753
01:03:06,610 --> 01:03:09,581
(A toilet with such a wide-open view...)

1754
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:11,449
- Like this.
- That's right.

1755
01:03:11,450 --> 01:03:12,719
- You're right.
- It's a toilet.

1756
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:13,751
You're right.

1757
01:03:13,851 --> 01:03:15,449
(What? A toilet...)

1758
01:03:15,450 --> 01:03:16,751
(That's right.)

1759
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:18,389
Is it a toilet?

1760
01:03:18,390 --> 01:03:20,621
(The structure is so stable.)

1761
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:22,331
It's called tongsi.

1762
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,929
(Jeju's traditional house features 4: Tongsi)

1763
01:03:24,930 --> 01:03:26,360
It's a Jeju-style toilet.

1764
01:03:27,101 --> 01:03:29,371
People of Jeju Island used to raise pigs...

1765
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:31,370
under the toilet.

1766
01:03:31,371 --> 01:03:32,839
That was why they were called poop pigs.

1767
01:03:32,840 --> 01:03:34,470
That was why they were called poop pigs.

1768
01:03:35,610 --> 01:03:38,210
Sometimes, they put up walls like a building.

1769
01:03:38,211 --> 01:03:40,010
They don't have walls here.

1770
01:03:40,280 --> 01:03:41,710
- I see.
- They put high walls.

1771
01:03:41,711 --> 01:03:43,009
So that others can't see you.

1772
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:44,780
(Amazed)

1773
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:47,150
They are the things you wouldn't see in other regions.

1774
01:03:47,151 --> 01:03:48,621
- You're right.
- Seriously.

1775
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:51,960
You came here unintentionally, but it was a good choice.

1776
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:53,120
- I know.
- Yes.

1777
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:54,530
- You picked a good spot.
- Yes.

1778
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:56,831
- I love it.
- We love it.

1779
01:03:56,890 --> 01:03:58,560
- Ms. Roh, thank you.
- Thank you.

1780
01:03:58,561 --> 01:04:00,659
You told us the great stories that are easy to understand.

1781
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:02,030
(The House of Mun Hyeong Haeng filled with Jeju's characteristics)

1782
01:04:03,371 --> 01:04:05,000
- So...
- Should I drive?

1783
01:04:05,001 --> 01:04:06,500
- I will...
- No, I'll drive.

1784
01:04:06,501 --> 01:04:07,909
Since I drove before. The seating is set for me.

1785
01:04:07,910 --> 01:04:09,840
- We have to drop by a cafe.
- A cafe?

1786
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:14,481
(The leader is frustrated.)

1787
01:04:15,711 --> 01:04:17,581
We don't have a chance or hope.

1788
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:20,120
- Why?
- We have the upper hand.

1789
01:04:20,121 --> 01:04:21,250
(Totally relaxed)

1790
01:04:21,251 --> 01:04:22,890
I think they almost lost already.

1791
01:04:23,121 --> 01:04:25,790
They are going for the quantity.

1792
01:04:25,791 --> 01:04:27,660
But we'll go for the bingo.

1793
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:30,430
- We should win.
- Let's go.

1794
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:32,331
We're going to the Bangju Church, not the V Garden.

1795
01:04:32,660 --> 01:04:34,030
Why did we do the rock-paper-scissors?

1796
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:36,001
We'll go wherever we feel like going.

1797
01:04:37,501 --> 01:04:38,740
Whatever now.

1798
01:04:38,970 --> 01:04:41,569
- No, Yi Kyung.
- Don't give up.

1799
01:04:41,570 --> 01:04:42,870
- You can't get sulky.
- That's right.

1800
01:04:42,871 --> 01:04:45,110
I'm not sulky. I'm angry.

1801
01:04:46,211 --> 01:04:48,581
We shouldn't give up. Our plan is going well.

1802
01:04:50,211 --> 01:04:52,651
Why is the Bangju Church famous?

1803
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:54,989
The tangerines they pick must be tasty.

1804
01:04:54,990 --> 01:04:57,219
- I know. They're so tasty.
- Can't we ask for some?

1805
01:04:57,220 --> 01:04:58,260
Gosh, I'm salivating.

1806
01:04:58,820 --> 01:04:59,890
(Salivating)

1807
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:02,660
Bangju Church got its name from Noah's Arc.

1808
01:05:02,691 --> 01:05:05,330
Tangerines are so fresh when you've just picked them.

1809
01:05:05,331 --> 01:05:06,601
Seriously. They're completely different.

1810
01:05:06,800 --> 01:05:08,700
- They fill you up.
- There are no hints or anything.

1811
01:05:08,731 --> 01:05:10,900
- They fill you up.
- There are no hints or anything.

1812
01:05:10,901 --> 01:05:12,639
You can also bring them home...

1813
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,441
and eat them while lying down on the heated floor.

1814
01:05:14,610 --> 01:05:16,870
They're so tasty if you eat them one at a time while watching TV.

1815
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:17,910
That's happiness.

1816
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:20,440
Freshly picked tangerines have thick skin.

1817
01:05:20,441 --> 01:05:22,981
- When you peel them...
- Your nails go yellow.

1818
01:05:23,151 --> 01:05:25,250
I'll lose and build a stonewall with Dong Hyun tomorrow.

1819
01:05:25,251 --> 01:05:27,020
- How sour.
- What's that?

1820
01:05:27,021 --> 01:05:29,120
- Hallabong, cheonhyehyang...
- Did you see that?

1821
01:05:29,121 --> 01:05:30,889
The only thought on my mind is, "Shall we buy some?"

1822
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:33,020
We need to win. Let's buy them after we win.

1823
01:05:33,021 --> 01:05:34,590
How about hallabong ade?

1824
01:05:34,791 --> 01:05:35,961
Ade?

1825
01:05:36,561 --> 01:05:38,929
We only went to one place and used up all the hints.

1826
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:39,930
Ade?

1827
01:05:40,331 --> 01:05:41,670
Beef gukbap?

1828
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:43,371
(Absorbed)

1829
01:05:43,671 --> 01:05:44,800
Gosh, I'm hungry.

1830
01:05:45,240 --> 01:05:46,600
(Incredulous)

1831
01:05:46,601 --> 01:05:48,469
If they don't give us hallabong ade...

1832
01:05:48,470 --> 01:05:49,970
- or caffe Americano...
- Let's eat and quit.

1833
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:52,279
He keeps giving up.

1834
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:53,580
- Don't quit.
- Why does he keep quitting...

1835
01:05:53,581 --> 01:05:54,811
when we're winning?

1836
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:57,380
We'll win since we took the middle square.

1837
01:05:57,381 --> 01:05:59,720
Not a single team has lost after taking the middle square.

1838
01:06:00,550 --> 01:06:02,250
It'll be a miracle...

1839
01:06:02,251 --> 01:06:04,620
if we take the Bangju Church and Jeju World Cup Stadium...

1840
01:06:04,621 --> 01:06:06,489
and make a bingo with three squares.

1841
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:08,029
Then...

1842
01:06:08,030 --> 01:06:09,730
we'll buy the plane tickets and go.

1843
01:06:09,731 --> 01:06:11,759
(Team Handsome imagines a happy outcome.)

1844
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:13,131
Shall we take the quiz?

1845
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:14,831
I really want to get this one right.

1846
01:06:15,371 --> 01:06:17,600
- Seriously.
- We must get this one right.

1847
01:06:17,601 --> 01:06:19,200
I don't want to use a chance.

1848
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:22,371
- I really need to use the restroom.
- What?

1849
01:06:22,811 --> 01:06:24,680
In that case, let's hurry up.

1850
01:06:25,410 --> 01:06:26,940
Come to think of it,

1851
01:06:26,941 --> 01:06:28,580
Sang Uk keeps having an issue with the restroom.

1852
01:06:28,581 --> 01:06:30,350
- I know.
- I've seen it somewhere.

1853
01:06:30,351 --> 01:06:32,751
- Do you want to use it first?
- No, it's okay.

1854
01:06:33,450 --> 01:06:34,820
(Pinching)

1855
01:06:34,921 --> 01:06:37,219
(I can hold it in.)

1856
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:38,620
- You can hold it in, right?
- Take your time.

1857
01:06:38,621 --> 01:06:40,359
I can hold it in.

1858
01:06:40,360 --> 01:06:41,429
(He can control this hardship for now.)

1859
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:42,690
Here comes the question.

1860
01:06:42,691 --> 01:06:44,429
(Time for Quiz)

1861
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:47,100
Back in the day on Jeju Island, many houses didn't have a door...

1862
01:06:47,101 --> 01:06:48,870
- since there were public order...
- A door.

1863
01:06:48,871 --> 01:06:51,541
And trust between the neighbors.

1864
01:06:51,671 --> 01:06:53,170
- What was it called?
- The stick.

1865
01:06:53,171 --> 01:06:56,110
Instead, people used the sticks called Jeongnang...

1866
01:06:56,340 --> 01:07:00,041
- to notify the owner's situation.
- I know that.

1867
01:07:00,311 --> 01:07:03,679
If all the sticks were down,

1868
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:06,081
- it meant, "I'm in the house." - Yes.

1869
01:07:07,021 --> 01:07:08,190
It'll be a hard question.

1870
01:07:08,191 --> 01:07:10,620
If two sticks were up,

1871
01:07:10,621 --> 01:07:12,690
it meant, "I'll be back in the evening."

1872
01:07:12,691 --> 01:07:14,831
- Were the messages that detailed?
- Yes.

1873
01:07:14,890 --> 01:07:18,799
If one stick was up,

1874
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:20,060
what did it mean?

1875
01:07:20,061 --> 01:07:22,929
(I'm in the house. I'll be back in the evening.)

1876
01:07:22,930 --> 01:07:25,041
So there are three sticks.

1877
01:07:25,371 --> 01:07:27,371
I learned it in elementary school.

1878
01:07:27,541 --> 01:07:28,811
I bet we learned it together.

1879
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:30,839
- Which school did you attend?
- Listen.

1880
01:07:30,840 --> 01:07:32,609
I didn't mean it like that.

1881
01:07:32,610 --> 01:07:33,711
Tell me this much.

1882
01:07:34,010 --> 01:07:35,481
What's the meaning if all three sticks are up?

1883
01:07:35,610 --> 01:07:38,949
If all three sticks are up, it means...

1884
01:07:38,950 --> 01:07:40,520
- It means the shutter is down.
- Yes.

1885
01:07:42,421 --> 01:07:44,221
It means, "I'll be away for a long while."

1886
01:07:44,721 --> 01:07:46,621
- "I'll be away for a long while." - What's that?

1887
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:48,330
- "I'll be away for a long while." - What's that?

1888
01:07:48,331 --> 01:07:49,391
- All 3 sticks are up.
- All 3 sticks are up.

1889
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:52,300
- "I'll be away..." - "A short while."

1890
01:07:52,301 --> 01:07:54,001
"I'll be away for a short while."

1891
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:57,730
"I'll be away for a short while." That means,

1892
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,871
- "I'll be back shortly." - Yes. "I'll be back shortly."

1893
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:02,711
- Right?
- Right.

1894
01:08:02,971 --> 01:08:04,040
- Let me answer.
- Let me answer.

1895
01:08:04,041 --> 01:08:05,940
- Hold on.
- Is it wrong?

1896
01:08:06,211 --> 01:08:08,081
Let us know if you're going to soil your pants.

1897
01:08:08,211 --> 01:08:09,380
Are you okay so far?

1898
01:08:09,381 --> 01:08:11,650
- I'll just poop. Don't worry.
- Here?

1899
01:08:12,051 --> 01:08:14,221
We need to be careful.

1900
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,590
Although we're here with a light heart...

1901
01:08:17,591 --> 01:08:18,920
Three sticks mean the owner will be gone...

1902
01:08:18,921 --> 01:08:20,260
- for a long while.
- That's right.

1903
01:08:20,261 --> 01:08:21,559
Two sticks mean the owner will be back...

1904
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,059
- in the evening.
- That's right.

1905
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:24,159
One stick has to mean,

1906
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:25,230
- "I'll be back shortly." - That's the only option.

1907
01:08:25,261 --> 01:08:27,931
- "Shortly?" "I'll be back?" - That's the only option.

1908
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:29,670
There's no way one stick suddenly means,

1909
01:08:29,671 --> 01:08:32,000
"I have an appointment with a friend."

1910
01:08:32,001 --> 01:08:33,400
"I'm away on a date."

1911
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:35,670
- "I'm out for coffee." - "I'm walking my horse."

1912
01:08:35,671 --> 01:08:36,770
That can't be it.

1913
01:08:37,011 --> 01:08:39,341
- "I'm walking my horse?" - Okay. Let's go with that.

1914
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:41,751
- "I'll be back shortly" is right.
- "I'll be back shortly?"

1915
01:08:42,110 --> 01:08:43,309
"I'll be back shortly."

1916
01:08:43,310 --> 01:08:44,720
(I'll be back shortly.)

1917
01:08:44,721 --> 01:08:45,820
We got it.

1918
01:08:45,881 --> 01:08:47,121
It has to be correct.

1919
01:08:47,157 --> 01:08:49,357
- "I'll be back shortly" is right.
- "I'll be back shortly?"

1920
01:08:49,926 --> 01:08:50,926
"I'll be back shortly."

1921
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:52,356
(I'll be back shortly.)

1922
01:08:52,357 --> 01:08:53,456
We got it.

1923
01:08:53,496 --> 01:08:54,795
It has to be correct.

1924
01:08:54,796 --> 01:08:56,597
- Correct.
- See?

1925
01:08:56,926 --> 01:08:59,536
The question was pretty okay.

1926
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:01,267
Go and get it.

1927
01:09:02,267 --> 01:09:03,267
(They get the bingo card for the House of Mun Hyeong Haeng.)

1928
01:09:03,268 --> 01:09:06,575
This one... You know, the quiz wasn't...

1929
01:09:06,576 --> 01:09:08,347
very difficult.

1930
01:09:08,546 --> 01:09:10,976
There's a food item on the back. Please check it.

1931
01:09:10,977 --> 01:09:13,716
Don't check it. You guys will want to eat it.

1932
01:09:13,947 --> 01:09:15,646
- It might not be a food item.
- Don't eat it.

1933
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,687
Is it ara?

1934
01:09:17,746 --> 01:09:21,085
(Aewol-eup, Jeju: Black pork)

1935
01:09:21,086 --> 01:09:22,527
Aewol-eup's black pork.

1936
01:09:22,557 --> 01:09:23,686
Come on.

1937
01:09:23,687 --> 01:09:26,097
- It'll be insane with meljeot.
- Black pork.

1938
01:09:26,227 --> 01:09:27,295
- Hold on.
- Black pork.

1939
01:09:27,296 --> 01:09:29,027
You guys promised not to do this.

1940
01:09:29,097 --> 01:09:31,027
Don't order a lot of food.

1941
01:09:31,496 --> 01:09:33,036
One, two, three.

1942
01:09:33,437 --> 01:09:35,505
- Black pork.
- Yes.

1943
01:09:35,506 --> 01:09:40,807
(Aewol-eup, Jeju-si: House of Mun Hyeong Haeng)

1944
01:09:40,937 --> 01:09:42,675
(Team Handsome)

1945
01:09:42,676 --> 01:09:43,746
Bangju Church.

1946
01:09:43,977 --> 01:09:46,316
It takes 24 minutes from here to the Jeju World Cup Stadium.

1947
01:09:46,317 --> 01:09:48,346
- Nice.
- This is the end.

1948
01:09:48,347 --> 01:09:49,487
We just need to get the quiz right.

1949
01:09:51,017 --> 01:09:54,517
(Bangju Church)

1950
01:09:55,386 --> 01:09:59,795
(A church that floats on the water)

1951
01:09:59,796 --> 01:10:00,857
Okay.

1952
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:02,496
- You're here.
- Hello.

1953
01:10:03,466 --> 01:10:05,035
There's sunlight.

1954
01:10:05,036 --> 01:10:06,635
How nice.

1955
01:10:06,636 --> 01:10:08,806
There's sunlight since Team Handsome came.

1956
01:10:08,807 --> 01:10:10,767
You're so kind.

1957
01:10:11,107 --> 01:10:13,205
- Shall we talk as we look at it?
- Okay.

1958
01:10:13,206 --> 01:10:14,675
This is a fun place.

1959
01:10:14,676 --> 01:10:16,477
Okay. Let's go.

1960
01:10:16,947 --> 01:10:19,016
It's called the Bangju Church.

1961
01:10:19,017 --> 01:10:20,675
I'm sure you've heard of Noah's Ark.

1962
01:10:20,676 --> 01:10:22,447
What does "Bangju" mean?

1963
01:10:22,546 --> 01:10:25,286
"Bang" is a character that's used for "Direction."

1964
01:10:25,487 --> 01:10:27,117
It means "Rectangular."

1965
01:10:27,456 --> 01:10:30,586
So a rectangular ship was called "Bangju" back in the day.

1966
01:10:30,727 --> 01:10:34,027
- Like Noah's Ark.
- That's right.

1967
01:10:34,326 --> 01:10:36,726
So Noah learned about the approaching flood...

1968
01:10:36,727 --> 01:10:37,766
and made a ship.

1969
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:40,596
Yes. The Ark signifies the salvation of mankind...

1970
01:10:40,597 --> 01:10:41,635
in the Bible.

1971
01:10:41,636 --> 01:10:44,307
The wooden columns of the building...

1972
01:10:44,636 --> 01:10:47,205
show the shape of a ship.

1973
01:10:47,206 --> 01:10:48,346
The building was made to look like that.

1974
01:10:48,347 --> 01:10:51,175
There's a pond around the building.

1975
01:10:51,176 --> 01:10:53,646
That's right. It looks like it's floating on the water.

1976
01:10:53,647 --> 01:10:54,785
The Arc.

1977
01:10:54,786 --> 01:10:55,786
(The surrounding pond shows the floating Arc.)

1978
01:10:55,787 --> 01:10:59,286
Instead of the traditional materials that are used for the church,

1979
01:10:59,657 --> 01:11:01,925
- modern materials were used.
- Other materials.

1980
01:11:01,926 --> 01:11:05,756
Metals of two tones were used.

1981
01:11:05,857 --> 01:11:07,495
The roof is metallic.

1982
01:11:07,496 --> 01:11:09,796
- It shines like a fish scale.
- Yes.

1983
01:11:10,067 --> 01:11:14,866
Modern and classical materials were mixed well.

1984
01:11:14,867 --> 01:11:16,335
(Metal and wood create harmony.)

1985
01:11:16,336 --> 01:11:19,336
The nature and architecture create harmony.

1986
01:11:19,737 --> 01:11:21,606
It's a very nice work of architecture.

1987
01:11:21,607 --> 01:11:22,675
(Bangju Church blends into the scenery of Jeju.)

1988
01:11:22,676 --> 01:11:24,246
It's a very pretty building.

1989
01:11:28,517 --> 01:11:29,517
(From the front, you can see the shape of the bow.)

1990
01:11:29,518 --> 01:11:31,147
- It's prettier from here.
- Right?

1991
01:11:31,386 --> 01:11:32,416
It looks so much like a ship.

1992
01:11:32,687 --> 01:11:33,817
It really looks like a ship.

1993
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,085
Big ships look like that...

1994
01:11:35,086 --> 01:11:36,755
from the below.

1995
01:11:36,756 --> 01:11:37,756
That's right.

1996
01:11:37,757 --> 01:11:39,157
That's what they look like.

1997
01:11:39,227 --> 01:11:41,326
You can see the reflection on the water.

1998
01:11:43,067 --> 01:11:44,126
(Looking)

1999
01:11:45,296 --> 01:11:48,336
Light comes from the bottom.

2000
01:11:48,567 --> 01:11:50,766
The reflected light makes it look holier.

2001
01:11:50,767 --> 01:11:51,776
(The ripples and the building reflect the light...)

2002
01:11:51,777 --> 01:11:52,777
(and create a holy vibe.)

2003
01:11:53,206 --> 01:11:55,245
Who's the architect?

2004
01:11:55,246 --> 01:11:56,646
His name was Itami Jun.

2005
01:11:56,647 --> 01:11:58,715
He wasn't Japanese.

2006
01:11:58,716 --> 01:11:59,847
- Really?
- He was Korean.

2007
01:11:59,876 --> 01:12:01,245
He was the second-generation Korean-Japanese.

2008
01:12:01,246 --> 01:12:03,085
His Korean name was Yoo Dong Ryong.

2009
01:12:03,086 --> 01:12:04,885
Yoo Dong Ryong.

2010
01:12:04,886 --> 01:12:08,557
He was born in Japan. He continued to work in Japan.

2011
01:12:08,687 --> 01:12:10,325
Since he had love for his home country,

2012
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,795
he didn't change his nationality. He worked a lot in Korea.

2013
01:12:12,796 --> 01:12:14,396
(He left many meaningful works in Korea.)

2014
01:12:14,397 --> 01:12:16,526
He built the Podo Hotel.

2015
01:12:16,527 --> 01:12:17,625
- Podo Hotel.
- Yes.

2016
01:12:17,626 --> 01:12:19,696
The bubble-shaped Podo Hotel.

2017
01:12:19,697 --> 01:12:20,737
He was the architect behind it.

2018
01:12:20,897 --> 01:12:23,505
There's also the Water Wind Stone Museum.

2019
01:12:23,506 --> 01:12:24,777
He left many works.

2020
01:12:24,907 --> 01:12:27,375
I especially like this church.

2021
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:30,545
Regardless of the meaning...

2022
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:32,846
If you look at this church during sundown,

2023
01:12:32,847 --> 01:12:34,476
the light gets reflected.

2024
01:12:34,477 --> 01:12:35,817
- It shines.
- Yes.

2025
01:12:36,246 --> 01:12:39,656
Yes. You can see the shiny building and the silhouette of Mount Sanbang.

2026
01:12:39,657 --> 01:12:41,116
In short, it's beautiful.

2027
01:12:41,117 --> 01:12:42,425
(The Bangju Church faces Mount Sanbang.)

2028
01:12:42,426 --> 01:12:45,526
- It's like this ship is going...
- To the sea.

2029
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:47,455
Yes. This church is like a ship that's going to the sea.

2030
01:12:47,456 --> 01:12:48,465
(The scenery of Bangju Church is reverent like a ship...)

2031
01:12:48,466 --> 01:12:49,466
(that's headed toward the sea.)

2032
01:12:49,727 --> 01:12:51,495
It must look very pretty from the above.

2033
01:12:51,496 --> 01:12:52,496
It looks very pretty.

2034
01:12:52,497 --> 01:12:54,807
I love that feeling every time I come here.

2035
01:12:54,836 --> 01:12:56,636
Maybe the question is about a ship.

2036
01:12:57,567 --> 01:12:59,075
Everything gets tied to the quiz.

2037
01:12:59,076 --> 01:13:01,106
I think it'll be about a ship.

2038
01:13:01,107 --> 01:13:03,246
"How can a ship float on the water?"

2039
01:13:03,576 --> 01:13:05,516
- How would we know that?
- No.

2040
01:13:05,517 --> 01:13:06,977
Tell us everything about the Ark.

2041
01:13:07,746 --> 01:13:09,045
Tell us everything you know.

2042
01:13:09,046 --> 01:13:10,646
In my opinion, that won't be the question.

2043
01:13:10,647 --> 01:13:12,215
After all, you guys are expecting it.

2044
01:13:12,216 --> 01:13:13,856
- Is that so?
- Such things won't get asked.

2045
01:13:13,857 --> 01:13:14,857
No?

2046
01:13:14,858 --> 01:13:16,085
Seriously, we...

2047
01:13:16,086 --> 01:13:17,156
(Cuckoo)

2048
01:13:17,157 --> 01:13:19,556
- They answered the question.
- House of Mun Hyeong Haeng.

2049
01:13:19,557 --> 01:13:21,027
- Where?
- House of Mun Hyeong Haeng.

2050
01:13:21,626 --> 01:13:23,227
- Okay.
- House of Mun Hyeong Haeng.

2051
01:13:23,296 --> 01:13:24,766
- They answered the question.
- House of Mun Hyeong Haeng.

2052
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:26,367
Shall we put the sticker on it now?

2053
01:13:26,437 --> 01:13:29,006
- Was it something you expected?
- Yes, it was something I expected.

2054
01:13:29,067 --> 01:13:30,236
They move as we expect.

2055
01:13:30,237 --> 01:13:32,307
But the problem is this. I can't predict my own team.

2056
01:13:32,907 --> 01:13:34,977
(The P Brothers are unpredictable.)

2057
01:13:35,076 --> 01:13:37,206
How do they answer all the questions?

2058
01:13:37,307 --> 01:13:39,616
Also, they work fast.

2059
01:13:39,617 --> 01:13:41,246
It seems like they don't eat.

2060
01:13:41,487 --> 01:13:42,487
(Team Guys)

2061
01:13:42,488 --> 01:13:43,746
Let's order as we enter.

2062
01:13:44,687 --> 01:13:45,786
Hello.

2063
01:13:45,916 --> 01:13:47,885
- Welcome.
- This is our table.

2064
01:13:47,886 --> 01:13:49,126
Why is the grill so big?

2065
01:13:49,586 --> 01:13:51,556
- My goodness.
- Look at this grill.

2066
01:13:51,557 --> 01:13:52,956
(Big)

2067
01:13:53,027 --> 01:13:55,027
There's seafood ramyeon.

2068
01:13:55,426 --> 01:13:56,567
- Hey.
- Tae Hyun.

2069
01:13:56,626 --> 01:13:58,966
- Earthen pot...
- Don't even look at the set menu.

2070
01:13:59,097 --> 01:14:00,196
Listen.

2071
01:14:00,197 --> 01:14:01,397
(Their eyes are fixed on the set menu.)

2072
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:02,665
What's wrong with them?

2073
01:14:02,666 --> 01:14:03,965
(What's wrong with them?)

2074
01:14:03,966 --> 01:14:06,076
Just eat five-layer pork belly.

2075
01:14:06,237 --> 01:14:08,376
Five-layer pork belly... What? Special cut?

2076
01:14:09,176 --> 01:14:10,946
How about two servings each?

2077
01:14:10,947 --> 01:14:13,516
Order 3 servings in total, not 2 servings each.

2078
01:14:13,517 --> 01:14:14,575
In that case...

2079
01:14:14,576 --> 01:14:16,947
How about 2 servings of special cut and 1 serving of 5-layer pork belly?

2080
01:14:17,117 --> 01:14:18,586
Let's get 2 servings of special cut and 1 serving of 5-layer pork belly.

2081
01:14:18,657 --> 01:14:21,415
- We can also get seafood ramyeon.
- Yes.

2082
01:14:21,416 --> 01:14:22,526
Two servings of special cut,

2083
01:14:22,527 --> 01:14:23,625
one serving of five-layer pork belly,

2084
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:25,196
and one seafood ramyeon.

2085
01:14:25,197 --> 01:14:27,357
Please give us all the food at once.

2086
01:14:27,496 --> 01:14:28,897
Shall we order two seafood ramyeon?

2087
01:14:29,527 --> 01:14:31,165
- Two seafood ramyeon?
- Shall we do that?

2088
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:33,166
- How about kimchi jjigae?
- Shall we do that?

2089
01:14:33,237 --> 01:14:34,437
(No.)

2090
01:14:34,636 --> 01:14:36,107
One seafood ramyeon and one kimchi jjigae?

2091
01:14:36,307 --> 01:14:38,607
We reached a conclusion, We're sorry.

2092
01:14:38,636 --> 01:14:40,436
Two servings of special cut,

2093
01:14:40,437 --> 01:14:41,476
one serving of five-layer pork belly,

2094
01:14:41,477 --> 01:14:42,545
one kimchi jjigae,

2095
01:14:42,546 --> 01:14:44,477
- and one seafood ramyeon.
- Yes.

2096
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,376
You'll get doenjang jjigae and steamed eggs for free.

2097
01:14:47,676 --> 01:14:49,117
- Will we get those dishes?
- Yes.

2098
01:14:49,517 --> 01:14:50,846
- You'll get those dishes.
- In that case,

2099
01:14:50,847 --> 01:14:52,415
- how about two seafood ramyeon?
- Okay.

2100
01:14:52,416 --> 01:14:54,455
- Two seafood ramyeon.
- Two seafood ramyeon.

2101
01:14:54,456 --> 01:14:55,625
Why are you ordering so much food?

2102
01:14:55,626 --> 01:14:57,487
Thank you. Please do your best.

2103
01:14:58,826 --> 01:15:01,097
You guys are unbelievable.

2104
01:15:01,197 --> 01:15:04,697
It hasn't been long since you guys ate.

2105
01:15:04,867 --> 01:15:06,496
- One grill.
- Yes.

2106
01:15:07,036 --> 01:15:08,306
It'll fit in one grill.

2107
01:15:08,307 --> 01:15:09,505
I like this grill.

2108
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:10,866
(Nodding)

2109
01:15:10,867 --> 01:15:12,736
(He's ridiculous.)

2110
01:15:12,737 --> 01:15:13,806
(Black pork comes in.)

2111
01:15:13,807 --> 01:15:15,146
- I'll put it on the grill.
- Okay.

2112
01:15:15,147 --> 01:15:16,977
- Five-layer pork belly.
- My goodness.

2113
01:15:17,807 --> 01:15:19,346
This is top loin.

2114
01:15:19,347 --> 01:15:20,816
(Top loin)

2115
01:15:20,817 --> 01:15:21,916
It just got added to the grill.

2116
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:23,216
- And...
- It's pork jowl.

2117
01:15:23,817 --> 01:15:25,456
(Pork jowl)

2118
01:15:25,886 --> 01:15:27,086
Thank you.

2119
01:15:27,886 --> 01:15:30,686
(There are side dishes such as napa cabbage kimchi, )

2120
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,896
Green onion kimchi.

2121
01:15:31,897 --> 01:15:33,057
(bean sprouts, and green onion kimchi!)

2122
01:15:33,796 --> 01:15:34,856
It looks tasty.

2123
01:15:34,857 --> 01:15:36,566
(The food makes them exclaim.)

2124
01:15:36,567 --> 01:15:39,197
I didn't think that it'd be grilled on the iron plate.

2125
01:15:39,836 --> 01:15:41,736
(He can only laugh.)

2126
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:45,206
It has only been an hour and a half since they ate.

2127
01:15:45,237 --> 01:15:46,376
- Is that so?
- Yes.

2128
01:15:46,576 --> 01:15:47,806
(Glancing over)

2129
01:15:47,807 --> 01:15:49,076
They're young.

2130
01:15:49,407 --> 01:15:50,505
That's right.

2131
01:15:50,506 --> 01:15:52,176
(These young men have a big appetite.)

2132
01:15:52,277 --> 01:15:54,116
(Meanwhile, the meat gets grilled perfectly.)

2133
01:15:54,117 --> 01:15:55,786
It's bound to be tasty.

2134
01:15:56,487 --> 01:15:57,686
Of course.

2135
01:15:57,687 --> 01:15:59,016
(Everyone is absorbed in the meat.)

2136
01:15:59,017 --> 01:16:00,657
It looks so tasty.

2137
01:16:01,216 --> 01:16:02,356
It looks so tasty, right?

2138
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:06,296
(It looks so amazing that they can already taste it.)

2139
01:16:06,727 --> 01:16:09,097
(The thought of eating makes them salivate.)

2140
01:16:09,996 --> 01:16:11,126
Will there be a fire show?

2141
01:16:11,867 --> 01:16:14,266
(It's time for a fire show.)

2142
01:16:14,267 --> 01:16:15,306
My goodness.

2143
01:16:15,307 --> 01:16:16,366
(The smoky aroma coats the meat.)

2144
01:16:16,367 --> 01:16:17,367
This is a bit...

2145
01:16:17,368 --> 01:16:19,836
The kimchi that absorbed oil will be so tasty.

2146
01:16:20,706 --> 01:16:23,576
- It looks tasty already.
- I know.

2147
01:16:24,006 --> 01:16:25,075
Dip it.

2148
01:16:25,076 --> 01:16:28,347
(The oldest member takes a bite first.)

2149
01:16:29,786 --> 01:16:31,415
(Impressed)

2150
01:16:31,416 --> 01:16:32,786
- It's tasty.
- Yes.

2151
01:16:33,157 --> 01:16:34,255
It needs to be cooked.

2152
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:36,256
(Seung Ho takes a bite as well.)

2153
01:16:37,456 --> 01:16:39,926
(This is it!)

2154
01:16:40,057 --> 01:16:42,126
(He puts a piece of grilled kimchi on the meat.)

2155
01:16:42,227 --> 01:16:45,996
(He puts it in his mouth.)

2156
01:16:46,437 --> 01:16:49,666
(Eating more food)

2157
01:16:51,166 --> 01:16:54,106
(No matter how much they eat, it continues to be tasty.)

2158
01:16:54,107 --> 01:16:55,307
- It's so tasty.
- Yes.

2159
01:16:56,447 --> 01:17:00,617
(They're becoming absorbed in the taste of black pork.)

2160
01:17:08,786 --> 01:17:10,057
Iced Americano?

2161
01:17:10,756 --> 01:17:11,896
Yes, I'll have iced Americano.

2162
01:17:11,897 --> 01:17:12,897
- Both of you?
- Yes.

2163
01:17:12,898 --> 01:17:14,226
- Will you go already?
- I'll go...

2164
01:17:14,227 --> 01:17:15,926
and buy iced Americano at 25 minutes.

2165
01:17:16,296 --> 01:17:18,535
- You should eat some more.
- It's okay.

2166
01:17:18,536 --> 01:17:19,696
Don't worry about me.

2167
01:17:19,697 --> 01:17:20,996
(He only thinks about saving time.)

2168
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:23,165
It's here.

2169
01:17:23,166 --> 01:17:24,466
- Really?
- It's here.

2170
01:17:25,076 --> 01:17:26,136
That's incredible.

2171
01:17:26,307 --> 01:17:28,446
(My goodness)

2172
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:29,947
You can eat once the noodles are cooked.

2173
01:17:30,477 --> 01:17:32,375
(Big)

2174
01:17:32,376 --> 01:17:33,477
- Really?
- It's here.

2175
01:17:34,317 --> 01:17:36,546
- That's incredible.
- That's incredible.

2176
01:17:36,746 --> 01:17:37,885
(It's full of fresh and plump seafood!)

2177
01:17:37,886 --> 01:17:39,016
Look at the seafood ramyeon.

2178
01:17:39,017 --> 01:17:43,426
(It's full of fresh and plump seafood!)

2179
01:17:44,057 --> 01:17:45,495
- It's here.
- Is that how it's served?

2180
01:17:45,496 --> 01:17:48,527
(The visual is shocking.)

2181
01:17:50,996 --> 01:17:52,965
We're ruined. You know,

2182
01:17:52,966 --> 01:17:55,267
until we came here,

2183
01:17:55,636 --> 01:17:57,607
the chance of our victory was 25 percent.

2184
01:17:57,636 --> 01:18:00,675
Once this dish got served, it dropped to ten percent.

2185
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:02,477
(Because of seafood ramyeon, it dropped to 10 percent.)

2186
01:18:03,076 --> 01:18:04,777
It looks amazing.

2187
01:18:05,117 --> 01:18:06,317
My goodness.

2188
01:18:07,216 --> 01:18:09,415
Ramyeon won't be tasty if the noodles become soggy.

2189
01:18:09,416 --> 01:18:11,046
Eat this as well.

2190
01:18:11,647 --> 01:18:13,357
This won't do.

2191
01:18:13,586 --> 01:18:16,156
I have to urge them to eat fast.

2192
01:18:16,157 --> 01:18:17,586
Otherwise,

2193
01:18:17,657 --> 01:18:19,026
they won't leave.

2194
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:20,056
(They'll eat all day long.)

2195
01:18:20,057 --> 01:18:22,266
I'll remove the shells.

2196
01:18:22,267 --> 01:18:23,496
(I'll remove the shells.)

2197
01:18:23,597 --> 01:18:25,166
You don't have time to remove the shells.

2198
01:18:25,937 --> 01:18:28,505
Don't worry about me.

2199
01:18:28,506 --> 01:18:30,336
Just enjoy the food and eat fast.

2200
01:18:30,407 --> 01:18:31,566
I'll do my best.

2201
01:18:31,567 --> 01:18:32,876
I'll do my best as well.

2202
01:18:33,706 --> 01:18:34,806
(He's eating to the best of his abilities.)

2203
01:18:34,807 --> 01:18:36,446
This is incredible.

2204
01:18:36,447 --> 01:18:37,607
(He's eating to the best of his abilities.)

2205
01:18:40,576 --> 01:18:43,347
Just don't say that you want to eat more.

2206
01:18:44,286 --> 01:18:46,586
As long as you don't say that, we'll be fine.

2207
01:18:47,357 --> 01:18:51,657
(The younger ones are devouring the black pork.)

2208
01:18:51,996 --> 01:18:54,157
I think I should peel the shrimp.

2209
01:18:55,966 --> 01:18:58,366
- Tae Hyun, I eat them whole.
- I also eat them whole.

2210
01:18:58,367 --> 01:19:00,697
Really? Thank goodness.

2211
01:19:01,197 --> 01:19:02,267
Here.

2212
01:19:02,907 --> 01:19:05,005
- Thank you, Tae Hyun.
- Thank you.

2213
01:19:05,006 --> 01:19:06,406
(All shells have been removed.)

2214
01:19:06,407 --> 01:19:08,545
(The man with a small appetite who deshelled seafood)

2215
01:19:08,546 --> 01:19:09,676
It's 25 minutes.

2216
01:19:09,947 --> 01:19:11,175
(He leaves to buy coffee.)

2217
01:19:11,176 --> 01:19:12,246
Iced Americano.

2218
01:19:12,347 --> 01:19:14,216
We'll leave at 35 minutes.

2219
01:19:14,447 --> 01:19:15,447
Okay.

2220
01:19:15,448 --> 01:19:16,746
At 35 minutes?

2221
01:19:17,086 --> 01:19:19,086
We just need to show him that we're eating diligently.

2222
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:21,356
He won't force us to leave at 35 minutes...

2223
01:19:21,357 --> 01:19:22,686
if we're enjoying the food.

2224
01:19:22,687 --> 01:19:24,085
Tae Hyun is full of love.

2225
01:19:24,086 --> 01:19:25,255
(Tae Hyun is full of love.)

2226
01:19:25,256 --> 01:19:27,496
(Shall I begin eating in earnest?)

2227
01:19:27,597 --> 01:19:30,296
(They start with the seafood ramyeon.)

2228
01:19:30,567 --> 01:19:32,436
(After cooling down the noodles, )

2229
01:19:32,437 --> 01:19:35,937
(he takes a big bite.)

2230
01:19:37,666 --> 01:19:40,206
(Slurping for the 2nd time)

2231
01:19:40,477 --> 01:19:42,176
(This is the taste.)

2232
01:19:44,407 --> 01:19:46,817
(Inhaling the noodles)

2233
01:19:47,676 --> 01:19:51,546
(Slurping)

2234
01:19:52,017 --> 01:19:55,357
(Inhaling food silently)

2235
01:19:55,426 --> 01:19:58,156
(Tae Hyun orders coffee to go...)

2236
01:19:58,157 --> 01:20:00,657
(and returns to the restaurant hurriedly.)

2237
01:20:00,756 --> 01:20:02,125
You didn't order more food, did you?

2238
01:20:02,126 --> 01:20:03,567
- No.
- Of course not.

2239
01:20:03,697 --> 01:20:07,567
(But they're still eating.)

2240
01:20:08,666 --> 01:20:09,666
Let's go.

2241
01:20:09,667 --> 01:20:11,406
(Let's go!)

2242
01:20:11,407 --> 01:20:12,606
It's 35 minutes.

2243
01:20:12,607 --> 01:20:13,936
(It's the promised time, 35 minutes.)

2244
01:20:13,937 --> 01:20:16,347
Why aren't we leaving? It's 35 minutes.

2245
01:20:16,977 --> 01:20:19,017
We were supposed to leave at 30 minutes.

2246
01:20:19,817 --> 01:20:22,146
(Avoiding eye contact)

2247
01:20:22,147 --> 01:20:24,085
(I can't believe them.)

2248
01:20:24,086 --> 01:20:26,656
(It looks like they still need more time.)

2249
01:20:26,657 --> 01:20:28,356
Let me use this time to think then.

2250
01:20:28,357 --> 01:20:29,687
Keep eating.

2251
01:20:30,756 --> 01:20:32,125
Let's see.

2252
01:20:32,126 --> 01:20:33,357
(He decides to come up with the next plan.)

2253
01:20:33,426 --> 01:20:34,896
If they fail to answer the question at the Bangju Church,

2254
01:20:34,897 --> 01:20:36,295
(If they fail to answer the question at the Bangju Church)

2255
01:20:36,296 --> 01:20:39,097
they won't be able to go to the World Cup Stadium.

2256
01:20:39,336 --> 01:20:40,636
Then they'll go to the Ctesiphon House.

2257
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:43,335
If this square gets blocked,

2258
01:20:43,336 --> 01:20:44,536
these two are the only options.

2259
01:20:44,907 --> 01:20:46,307
It's close to the church.

2260
01:20:46,437 --> 01:20:48,846
So we'll go to the Ctesiphon House.

2261
01:20:48,847 --> 01:20:50,175
(Team Guys decides to go to the Ctesiphon House as well.)

2262
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,306
Right?

2263
01:20:51,307 --> 01:20:53,216
(Right?)

2264
01:20:53,817 --> 01:20:55,786
Okay. In any case...

2265
01:20:56,317 --> 01:20:57,687
In any case, that's what I think.

2266
01:20:58,216 --> 01:20:59,585
Let's go to the Ctesiphon House.

2267
01:20:59,586 --> 01:21:01,357
(Let's go to the Ctesiphon House.)

2268
01:21:01,416 --> 01:21:03,687
- Let's go down.
- Let's go down.

2269
01:21:03,826 --> 01:21:05,856
Let's go to a nearby place.

2270
01:21:05,857 --> 01:21:08,496
We cleared the mission successfully.

2271
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:10,226
- Good.
- Hold on.

2272
01:21:10,227 --> 01:21:11,726
Let's go to the Ctesiphon House.

2273
01:21:11,727 --> 01:21:12,897
- All right.
- This is...

2274
01:21:13,097 --> 01:21:14,295
If we meet them...

2275
01:21:14,296 --> 01:21:15,867
(This is...)

2276
01:21:16,367 --> 01:21:18,536
They haven't had enough food.

2277
01:21:19,036 --> 01:21:20,406
Let's eat more food at the Ctesiphon House.

2278
01:21:20,407 --> 01:21:21,607
(Let's eat more food at the Ctesiphon House.)

2279
01:21:21,947 --> 01:21:23,806
We need to get ara.

2280
01:21:23,807 --> 01:21:25,107
(We need to get ara.)

2281
01:21:25,246 --> 01:21:27,045
Thank you for the food.

2282
01:21:27,046 --> 01:21:28,376
Thank you for the food.

2283
01:21:28,647 --> 01:21:30,846
- Please.
- Please.

2284
01:21:30,847 --> 01:21:32,716
- All right.
- Please.

2285
01:21:33,256 --> 01:21:35,156
Please.

2286
01:21:35,157 --> 01:21:37,156
- We need to get it right.
- Please.

2287
01:21:37,157 --> 01:21:38,856
It'll be bad if we get this wrong.

2288
01:21:38,857 --> 01:21:40,255
We need to get this right...

2289
01:21:40,256 --> 01:21:41,826
- to go to the World Cup Stadium.
- Yes.

2290
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:43,527
ChatGPT.

2291
01:21:44,666 --> 01:21:46,766
(This is incredible.)

2292
01:21:46,767 --> 01:21:47,795
This is incredible.

2293
01:21:47,796 --> 01:21:48,866
Look at this.

2294
01:21:48,867 --> 01:21:51,705
I asked this question.

2295
01:21:51,706 --> 01:21:52,777
(What would be a possible quiz about Noah's Ark?)

2296
01:21:53,176 --> 01:21:54,335
This is incredible.

2297
01:21:54,336 --> 01:21:55,477
Here.

2298
01:21:55,977 --> 01:21:58,506
Wouldn't this be a good quiz?

2299
01:21:59,147 --> 01:22:00,447
This is incredible.

2300
01:22:01,477 --> 01:22:03,516
- Are you studying?
- What?

2301
01:22:03,517 --> 01:22:04,646
- Are you studying?
- Yes.

2302
01:22:04,647 --> 01:22:06,656
Here. I asked this question too.

2303
01:22:06,657 --> 01:22:07,716
(What would be a fun question about Noah's Ark from a TV station?)

2304
01:22:07,857 --> 01:22:09,956
What would be a fun question about Noah's Ark from a TV station?

2305
01:22:09,987 --> 01:22:11,487
Then I got this information.

2306
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:14,526
(Serious as if they were studying before a test)

2307
01:22:14,527 --> 01:22:16,726
I'm sorry, but would you tell us what you're looking at?

2308
01:22:16,727 --> 01:22:18,196
- No.
- We'll tell you later.

2309
01:22:18,197 --> 01:22:19,567
We'll tell you after we get it right.

2310
01:22:20,036 --> 01:22:22,835
After we solve the quiz... Let's solve the quiz now.

2311
01:22:22,836 --> 01:22:23,906
- Okay.
- Okay.

2312
01:22:23,907 --> 01:22:24,907
(Andeok-myeon, Seogwipo-si: Bangju Church)

2313
01:22:24,908 --> 01:22:26,237
(Time for Quiz)

2314
01:22:26,376 --> 01:22:27,477
Here it comes.

2315
01:22:27,576 --> 01:22:28,576
- Okay.
- Okay.

2316
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:32,947
- If it's something unexpected...
- Please.

2317
01:22:33,676 --> 01:22:36,316
- Bangju Church is...
- Yes.

2318
01:22:36,317 --> 01:22:37,346
(So it's about the Ark. Nice.)

2319
01:22:37,347 --> 01:22:40,885
a church that's modeled after a ship on the water, right?

2320
01:22:40,886 --> 01:22:41,915
- Yes.
- Yes.

2321
01:22:41,916 --> 01:22:44,326
(It's a church that's modeled after a ship on the water.)

2322
01:22:44,727 --> 01:22:46,556
But Jeju Island...

2323
01:22:46,557 --> 01:22:48,496
(But Jeju Island)

2324
01:22:48,897 --> 01:22:50,527
For goodness' sake.

2325
01:22:50,597 --> 01:22:52,796
- Will you ask us about the island?
- Really?

2326
01:22:53,367 --> 01:22:56,166
Water has always been scarce on Jeju Island,

2327
01:22:56,206 --> 01:22:59,636
so there are many idioms about water.

2328
01:22:59,937 --> 01:23:01,476
Idioms about water?

2329
01:23:01,477 --> 01:23:05,045
Now, you'll hear an idiom about water.

2330
01:23:05,046 --> 01:23:06,647
Guess the meaning.

2331
01:23:06,676 --> 01:23:08,916
Give us the exact translation.

2332
01:23:09,246 --> 01:23:10,385
(What's the meaning of the following idiom?)

2333
01:23:10,386 --> 01:23:12,517
If you sseumin water hayeong when you wash nhot,

2334
01:23:12,657 --> 01:23:14,886
you'll need to montak meokeosa in the afterlife.

2335
01:23:15,117 --> 01:23:17,286
If you sseumin water hayeong when you wash nhot,

2336
01:23:17,527 --> 01:23:19,796
you'll need to montak meokeosa in the afterlife.

2337
01:23:22,166 --> 01:23:24,296
- Hold on.
- No.

2338
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:27,066
No. I got some of it.

2339
01:23:27,067 --> 01:23:28,335
If you drink this water,

2340
01:23:28,336 --> 01:23:30,767
you'll need to do something in the afterlife.

2341
01:23:31,006 --> 01:23:33,076
I think you're right.

2342
01:23:33,307 --> 01:23:35,406
- Please let us hear it again.
- As many times as you want.

2343
01:23:35,407 --> 01:23:36,407
(They can stream it endlessly.)

2344
01:23:37,076 --> 01:23:38,276
If we could understand it...

2345
01:23:38,277 --> 01:23:40,375
(If you sseumin water hayeong when you wash nhot)

2346
01:23:40,376 --> 01:23:42,647
(Incomprehensible)

2347
01:23:44,987 --> 01:23:47,487
(Writing down what he hears as if he was on "Amazing Saturday")

2348
01:23:47,517 --> 01:23:50,325
If you sseumin water when you're exhausted...

2349
01:23:50,326 --> 01:23:52,456
- What does it mean?
- Let us hear it again.

2350
01:23:53,956 --> 01:23:55,026
Let's record it.

2351
01:23:55,027 --> 01:23:58,367
(Even voice recording is being used.)

2352
01:23:58,996 --> 01:24:01,437
The water won't be drunk in the afterlife.

2353
01:24:01,597 --> 01:24:04,066
I think it means the water will be drunk in the afterlife.

2354
01:24:04,067 --> 01:24:05,436
That was what I heard too.

2355
01:24:05,437 --> 01:24:06,976
(All of the water will be drunk in the afterlife?)

2356
01:24:06,977 --> 01:24:08,906
It's a saying that was made...

2357
01:24:08,907 --> 01:24:10,146
- as water was precious.
- Right.

2358
01:24:10,147 --> 01:24:12,245
It should be based on...

2359
01:24:12,246 --> 01:24:13,847
- Right.
- saving water.

2360
01:24:14,546 --> 01:24:19,216
"If you waste water like this,"

2361
01:24:19,517 --> 01:24:21,286
"you have to drink all of it in the afterlife!"

2362
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:23,527
Is that it?

2363
01:24:23,727 --> 01:24:25,795
This was said in the past. "If you leave your food,"

2364
01:24:25,796 --> 01:24:27,455
"you have to eat all of it in the afterlife."

2365
01:24:27,456 --> 01:24:28,825
- Have you heard of this one before?
- I have.

2366
01:24:28,826 --> 01:24:30,897
This one is based on water. "If you waste water,"

2367
01:24:31,126 --> 01:24:32,635
"all of this water..."

2368
01:24:32,636 --> 01:24:35,267
"must be drunk in the afterlife."

2369
01:24:35,867 --> 01:24:36,867
Could that be it?

2370
01:24:36,868 --> 01:24:38,066
(Being shaken)

2371
01:24:38,067 --> 01:24:39,437
What's the first part then?

2372
01:24:39,676 --> 01:24:41,236
"If you waste water now,"

2373
01:24:41,237 --> 01:24:43,205
"you have to drink all of it in the afterlife."

2374
01:24:43,206 --> 01:24:44,306
- You're from Jeju, right?
- "If you..."

2375
01:24:44,307 --> 01:24:46,316
Could you play the first part again?

2376
01:24:46,317 --> 01:24:47,346
"If you..."

2377
01:24:47,347 --> 01:24:49,947
Could you play the first part again?

2378
01:24:50,317 --> 01:24:53,586
Just the first part. Please.

2379
01:24:54,416 --> 01:24:56,556
- Just one more time.
- Let's hear it again here.

2380
01:24:56,557 --> 01:24:57,756
- It's one or the other.
- From the native speaker.

2381
01:24:59,296 --> 01:25:01,325
(When you're exhausted?)

2382
01:25:01,326 --> 01:25:02,995
One more time. When you wash up?

2383
01:25:02,996 --> 01:25:05,566
(When you wash up?)

2384
01:25:05,567 --> 01:25:07,767
- When you wash up.
- Gosh!

2385
01:25:08,496 --> 01:25:10,266
When you waste water when you wash up!

2386
01:25:10,267 --> 01:25:12,135
- You use a lot of water then.
- It's not "exhausted."

2387
01:25:12,136 --> 01:25:13,776
- Right.
- So it's about the water used...

2388
01:25:13,777 --> 01:25:14,906
- when washing up.
- Okay.

2389
01:25:14,907 --> 01:25:16,545
You use a lot of water when you wash up.

2390
01:25:16,546 --> 01:25:19,075
"If you waste water,"

2391
01:25:19,076 --> 01:25:20,376
"you'll need to drink all of it in the afterlife."

2392
01:25:21,046 --> 01:25:22,117
Team Handsome.

2393
01:25:22,886 --> 01:25:24,545
- Gosh!
- Please!

2394
01:25:24,546 --> 01:25:26,255
("If you waste water, you'll need to drink all of it in the afterlife.")

2395
01:25:26,256 --> 01:25:27,915
("you have to drink all of it in the afterlife.")

2396
01:25:27,916 --> 01:25:28,955
A triangle.

2397
01:25:28,956 --> 01:25:30,356
- A triangle?
- What's a triangle?

2398
01:25:30,357 --> 01:25:32,156
A triangle? What's a triangle?

2399
01:25:32,157 --> 01:25:33,625
"If you waste water,"

2400
01:25:33,626 --> 01:25:35,196
"you'll need to drink all of it in the afterlife."

2401
01:25:35,197 --> 01:25:36,727
This part is correct.

2402
01:25:37,626 --> 01:25:38,965
- Right.
- But...

2403
01:25:38,966 --> 01:25:40,767
- What did we say?
- there's something else.

2404
01:25:40,996 --> 01:25:42,165
Here's your last opportunity.

2405
01:25:42,166 --> 01:25:43,606
- Hold on.
- Gosh.

2406
01:25:43,607 --> 01:25:45,835
You will be incorrect if you say the wrong answer this time.

2407
01:25:45,836 --> 01:25:47,005
- Hold on.
- So...

2408
01:25:47,006 --> 01:25:49,607
So we have to get the "wash up" part right.

2409
01:25:49,907 --> 01:25:52,175
- Right. That part is incorrect.
- We have to get that part.

2410
01:25:52,176 --> 01:25:53,976
If you sseumin water hayeong when you wash nhot...

2411
01:25:53,977 --> 01:25:56,285
"If you sseumin water hayeong when you wash nhot..."

2412
01:25:56,286 --> 01:25:57,446
Shall we stay seated for a while?

2413
01:25:57,447 --> 01:25:59,317
"If you sseumin water hayeong when you wash nhot..."

2414
01:25:59,617 --> 01:26:02,256
We said it was "wash up."

2415
01:26:02,926 --> 01:26:05,386
- Is it not "wash up?" - If it's not that...

2416
01:26:06,057 --> 01:26:07,926
"If you sseumin water hayeong when you wash nhot,"

2417
01:26:08,227 --> 01:26:10,125
"you'll need to montak meokeosa in the afterlife."

2418
01:26:10,126 --> 01:26:11,227
I got it all memorized now.

2419
01:26:12,267 --> 01:26:13,536
Go with what you want.

2420
01:26:13,966 --> 01:26:15,566
The answer that was given the triangle.

2421
01:26:15,567 --> 01:26:17,135
"If you sseumin water hayeong when you wash nhot,"

2422
01:26:17,136 --> 01:26:19,876
"you'll need to drink all of it in the afterlife."

2423
01:26:21,477 --> 01:26:22,575
- That's right.
- That's right, isn't it?

2424
01:26:22,576 --> 01:26:23,705
- That's the answer.
- Right.

2425
01:26:23,706 --> 01:26:25,276
You spoke in the Jeju dialect for the first part.

2426
01:26:25,277 --> 01:26:27,277
"If you sseumin water hayeong when you wash nhot,"

2427
01:26:27,376 --> 01:26:29,915
"you'll need to drink all of it in the afterlife."

2428
01:26:29,916 --> 01:26:31,486
You are right there.

2429
01:26:31,487 --> 01:26:33,385
I'll give you one last chance to say the answer.

2430
01:26:33,386 --> 01:26:34,715
We've been stalling for too long.

2431
01:26:34,716 --> 01:26:35,925
Did you not say "wash up" earlier?

2432
01:26:35,926 --> 01:26:37,157
He didn't say "wash up" earlier.

2433
01:26:37,386 --> 01:26:39,295
That's right. We must've made a mistake.

2434
01:26:39,296 --> 01:26:41,026
- That's the right answer.
- Right.

2435
01:26:41,027 --> 01:26:43,325
I think we left that out as we were in a hurry.

2436
01:26:43,326 --> 01:26:45,165
- Right.
- Then listen to me say it.

2437
01:26:45,166 --> 01:26:46,665
Check if I said it correctly or not.

2438
01:26:46,666 --> 01:26:47,767
All right. Here's the answer.

2439
01:26:47,966 --> 01:26:50,067
"If you waste water when you wash up,"

2440
01:26:50,937 --> 01:26:54,907
"you'll need to drink all of it in the afterlife."

2441
01:26:55,036 --> 01:26:56,147
- Was I right?
- Yes.

2442
01:26:56,206 --> 01:26:59,147
(During the 1st attempt)

2443
01:27:00,216 --> 01:27:02,016
"If you waste water when you wash up,"

2444
01:27:02,017 --> 01:27:03,617
"you'll need to drink all of it in the afterlife."

2445
01:27:03,847 --> 01:27:06,986
"Wash up" isn't actually "take a shower,"

2446
01:27:06,987 --> 01:27:09,656
"wash your face," or "brush your teeth," right?

2447
01:27:09,657 --> 01:27:10,857
- It can't be that.
- It can't be that.

2448
01:27:11,586 --> 01:27:13,357
You are incorrect.

2449
01:27:13,897 --> 01:27:16,597
You got most of it right,

2450
01:27:17,197 --> 01:27:18,227
but it wasn't the answer.

2451
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:20,836
What could "when you wash nhot" be?

2452
01:27:21,296 --> 01:27:22,666
- What?
- "When you wash nhot."

2453
01:27:23,237 --> 01:27:24,636
- "When you wash nhot." - "When you wash nhot."

2454
01:27:25,407 --> 01:27:26,875
- That's...
- Jin said the right answer.

2455
01:27:26,876 --> 01:27:28,237
- What?
- What?

2456
01:27:28,807 --> 01:27:29,946
Jin said the right answer.

2457
01:27:29,947 --> 01:27:31,176
- I said the answer again?
- Yes.

2458
01:27:31,447 --> 01:27:32,777
- Gosh.
- What did you say?

2459
01:27:33,517 --> 01:27:34,817
- What could it be?
- Me?

2460
01:27:34,947 --> 01:27:36,117
What did you say?

2461
01:27:37,147 --> 01:27:38,687
I said we should edit this out and do it again.

2462
01:27:38,847 --> 01:27:41,157
(Lying)

2463
01:27:41,456 --> 01:27:43,325
Have you heard about washing your nhot?

2464
01:27:43,326 --> 01:27:44,526
- What?
- Washing your nhot.

2465
01:27:44,527 --> 01:27:45,696
Nhot?

2466
01:27:45,697 --> 01:27:47,657
- It means your face.
- Right.

2467
01:27:47,857 --> 01:27:49,925
If you sseumin water hayeong when you wash nhot,

2468
01:27:49,926 --> 01:27:51,926
(When you wash your face)

2469
01:27:52,336 --> 01:27:54,496
you'll need to montak meokeosa in the afterlife.

2470
01:27:56,206 --> 01:27:58,465
- This is going to be controversial.
- This is going to be controversial.

2471
01:27:58,466 --> 01:28:00,205
"Wash up" and "wash your face."

2472
01:28:00,206 --> 01:28:01,675
You said "wash up."

2473
01:28:01,676 --> 01:28:03,506
How can we get that?

2474
01:28:03,576 --> 01:28:05,245
This is worthy of becoming controversial.

2475
01:28:05,246 --> 01:28:07,376
It's because I'm going to make it sound controversial.

2476
01:28:07,847 --> 01:28:09,216
- Seriously.
- It's because...

2477
01:28:09,317 --> 01:28:10,616
- How can we get that?
- We won't get the answer.

2478
01:28:10,617 --> 01:28:12,286
You should all be swept away in controversy.

2479
01:28:13,716 --> 01:28:16,126
- It was so hard.
- Gosh.

2480
01:28:16,426 --> 01:28:17,856
We would've never got that. That was unbelievable.

2481
01:28:17,857 --> 01:28:20,057
(How will this face-washing controversy end?)

2482
01:28:20,099 --> 01:28:21,429
(A while ago)

2483
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:24,369
(An extreme difficulty that sparked controversy)

2484
01:28:24,370 --> 01:28:25,869
(The face-washing controversy...)

2485
01:28:25,870 --> 01:28:27,539
(that happened in Bangju Church)

2486
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:29,039
(They don't care.)

2487
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,410
(Done! Correct!)

2488
01:28:32,009 --> 01:28:34,008
(Team Guys is pacing forward with confidence.)

2489
01:28:34,009 --> 01:28:35,540
(How many places have they gone to?)

2490
01:28:35,879 --> 01:28:37,879
(Team Handsome is on the verge of defeat.)

2491
01:28:38,450 --> 01:28:40,978
(Team Guys must get it wrong for them to win.)

2492
01:28:40,979 --> 01:28:42,518
(They'll get it wrong if they go to Bangju Church!)

2493
01:28:42,519 --> 01:28:43,820
(Let's go to Bangju Church.)

2494
01:28:44,190 --> 01:28:46,059
(We're different from you guys.)

2495
01:28:46,389 --> 01:28:49,558
(Team Guys face the face-washing controversy.)

2496
01:28:49,559 --> 01:28:50,829
(Answering the quiz at Bangju Church)

2497
01:28:50,830 --> 01:28:52,500
(It's an act of using a lot of water.)

2498
01:28:52,599 --> 01:28:55,460
(It's about washing something.)

2499
01:28:55,799 --> 01:28:58,168
(They're getting closer to the answer.)

2500
01:28:58,169 --> 01:29:00,269
(Washing the face)

2501
01:29:00,570 --> 01:29:02,138
(Getting it right at Bangju Church?)

2502
01:29:02,139 --> 01:29:03,239
(That makes no sense.)

2503
01:29:03,240 --> 01:29:05,440
(I was expecting something based on the Jeju dialect.)

2504
01:29:05,780 --> 01:29:07,839
(Team Guys goes with their confidence once again.)

2505
01:29:08,139 --> 01:29:09,848
("If you waste water when you blank,")

2506
01:29:09,849 --> 01:29:11,549
("you'll need to drink all of it in the afterlife.")

2507
01:29:11,950 --> 01:29:13,449
(Team Handsome...)

2508
01:29:13,450 --> 01:29:14,450
(and Team Guys)

2509
01:29:14,451 --> 01:29:16,820
(The start of a legendary battle)

2510
01:29:17,120 --> 01:29:22,960
(How will the face-washing controversy end?)
