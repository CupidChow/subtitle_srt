1
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:16,918
(Handsome Yu Rim, Yoon Kyung Ho)

2
00:00:17,248 --> 00:00:20,419
(Kyung from Yi Kyung and Ho from Seung Ho)

3
00:00:20,589 --> 00:00:22,718
(They split into two teams based on Kyung Ho's idea.)

4
00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:24,158
(Team Guys, Team Handsome)

5
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:25,788
(Handsome Heritage)

6
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:27,388
(Content creators in Gyeonggi Province)

7
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,288
(A new rule)

8
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:32,099
(The competition starts at the opening segment.)

9
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:34,568
(A fan of Handsome Guys, Kyung Ho's participation)

10
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:37,598
(Team Handsome gets the upper hand.)

11
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:38,637
After going to Hanam...

12
00:00:38,638 --> 00:00:40,168
(From what they scored first, )

13
00:00:40,169 --> 00:00:41,538
(Team Handsome goes after cities in the south.)

14
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:42,638
(By targeting the north, )

15
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:43,907
(Team Handsome tries to turn the tables.)

16
00:00:43,908 --> 00:00:45,407
(The first choice by Team Guys who need to make a leap)

17
00:00:45,408 --> 00:00:46,749
(Namyangju: Workout)

18
00:00:47,278 --> 00:00:50,048
(Sang Uk seems more confident than usual today.)

19
00:00:50,278 --> 00:00:52,448
(Winning the first quiz)

20
00:00:52,649 --> 00:00:54,118
(Team Guys obtained their first square without the reattempt card.)

21
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,948
(Namyangju: Workout)

22
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:58,119
(After making an error on their first quiz, )

23
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:00,189
(Team Handsome used their re-attempt card.)

24
00:01:00,429 --> 00:01:02,728
(They're still ahead in the race.)

25
00:01:03,098 --> 00:01:06,869
(They head to Yongin as their next destination.)

26
00:01:07,228 --> 00:01:10,068
(Still feeling energy of victory)

27
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:12,768
(Team Guys with irresistible force)

28
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:17,239
(They didn't listen to Sang Uk who had sixth sense.)

29
00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:19,278
(Their answer was incorrect.)

30
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:21,549
(The answer is athlete.)

31
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,179
(We should've listened to Sang Uk.)

32
00:01:24,478 --> 00:01:26,918
(Team Guys ended up using their re-attempt card.)

33
00:01:27,349 --> 00:01:31,619
(Current score, 2:2)

34
00:01:32,058 --> 00:01:34,058
(Is he becoming an ace?)

35
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:36,497
(Sang Uk is on a roll.)

36
00:01:36,498 --> 00:01:39,197
(How far will Sang Uk's sixth sense take them?)

37
00:01:39,198 --> 00:01:41,128
(Team Handsome)

38
00:01:41,129 --> 00:01:42,197
This is...

39
00:01:42,198 --> 00:01:43,198
(Their current location is Yongin, Gyeonggi Province.)

40
00:01:43,199 --> 00:01:45,467
This is an old road.

41
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:47,068
Aren't we going to the amusement park?

42
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:48,209
- Yes. - Right.

43
00:01:49,168 --> 00:01:50,937
(Yongin: Street Casting)

44
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:52,178
(They arrive in Yongin while humming.)

45
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:53,209
All right.

46
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,748
Team Guys is at the place in Yongin.

47
00:01:59,278 --> 00:02:00,349
I see. Turn around.

48
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:02,217
(Yongin: Street Casting)

49
00:02:02,218 --> 00:02:03,959
I see. Turn around quickly.

50
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:07,227
Wait. Either way...

51
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:10,598
(Team Handsome is flustered.)

52
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,197
- We should go somewhere else now. - Right.

53
00:02:12,198 --> 00:02:14,429
We must go. It will take a long time.

54
00:02:14,769 --> 00:02:16,437
(Yongin: Street Casting)

55
00:02:16,438 --> 00:02:18,067
This is giving me a headache.

56
00:02:18,068 --> 00:02:20,067
Here's why. If they win Yongin,

57
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:21,338
then...

58
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:23,138
Actually...

59
00:02:23,139 --> 00:02:24,738
(He detects a possible bingo.)

60
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:27,747
(Namyangju, Yangpyeong, Yongin)

61
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,479
We strongly thought...

62
00:02:29,748 --> 00:02:31,347
that they failed to win Yangpyeong.

63
00:02:31,348 --> 00:02:32,348
Right.

64
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,087
Tae Hyun loves to win the center square,

65
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,287
and he hasn't won it yet?

66
00:02:36,288 --> 00:02:37,988
- It probably means that he failed. - Right.

67
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:39,257
(They went there and got it wrong.)

68
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:41,287
Then we can keep Yangpyeong available.

69
00:02:41,288 --> 00:02:42,459
Yes.

70
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:44,958
Then it's Seongnam B.

71
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,319
- We must go to Seongnam B. - Yes.

72
00:02:46,468 --> 00:02:47,628
Let's go there.

73
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,567
All right, let's relax.

74
00:02:49,568 --> 00:02:50,568
Go with ease.

75
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:53,307
Seung Ho, you'll answer the quiz about unusual animals.

76
00:02:53,308 --> 00:02:55,508
- I'll do my best. - Okay.

77
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,338
We got this.

78
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,778
We got it, so stop thinking.

79
00:02:59,878 --> 00:03:01,578
Even Tae Hyun takes it simply.

80
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:03,449
One, two, three, four.

81
00:03:03,979 --> 00:03:08,348
(Oh, we're Handsome Guys)

82
00:03:09,718 --> 00:03:11,419
- We are - I feel better now.

83
00:03:13,588 --> 00:03:15,329
(Burst out laughing)

84
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:18,598
(Laughing)

85
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:21,168
(With good vibes, Team Handsome heads to Seongnam.)

86
00:03:21,169 --> 00:03:22,399
Your singing improved.

87
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:25,097
(They arrive in Seongnam.)

88
00:03:25,098 --> 00:03:26,538
I've never been here before.

89
00:03:27,568 --> 00:03:28,967
You have long legs.

90
00:03:28,968 --> 00:03:30,478
I'm running while you're walking.

91
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,479
(Seung Ho charges forward as soon as they arrive.)

92
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:35,347
(To where Jegal Seung Ho is leading them)

93
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:36,378
Is this... What?

94
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:37,678
- Here it is. - There it is.

95
00:03:37,679 --> 00:03:39,919
(A claw machine shop?)

96
00:03:40,449 --> 00:03:44,257
(While picking chance cards this morning)

97
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:47,028
(They picked very annoying cards.)

98
00:03:47,429 --> 00:03:51,359
(Claw machine card, 30 minutes)

99
00:03:52,128 --> 00:03:53,169
This is it.

100
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:54,629
- We can pay by card. - All right.

101
00:03:54,998 --> 00:03:56,268
Which one shall we play?

102
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,399
Take a look and see which one is good.

103
00:03:58,899 --> 00:04:00,068
The one that's easy to win?

104
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:03,908
(They clear the mission as soon as they win 1.)

105
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:05,937
- In my opinion, - Either way...

106
00:04:05,938 --> 00:04:07,449
small ones are easier to win.

107
00:04:08,908 --> 00:04:10,179
I'll do this one.

108
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:11,717
I'll play this.

109
00:04:11,718 --> 00:04:14,348
(Seung Ho tries to win a big stuffed animal.)

110
00:04:15,949 --> 00:04:17,889
(Having an advanced technique)

111
00:04:18,889 --> 00:04:19,959
Come on.

112
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:24,058
(However, he fails.)

113
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,729
This claw is very weak.

114
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,799
(Kyung Ho picked the one with small stuffed animals instead.)

115
00:04:31,599 --> 00:04:35,369
(Having refined control like a robot)

116
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:40,979
(Exclaiming)

117
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:41,979
What's going on?

118
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:44,018
(Already?)

119
00:04:44,148 --> 00:04:46,077
(What will be the result?)

120
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:48,188
(Failed)

121
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:51,289
Kyung Ho, you get excited so easily.

122
00:04:52,558 --> 00:04:54,058
I can't believe...

123
00:04:54,359 --> 00:04:56,359
we're playing claw machines as a mission.

124
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:58,698
I got it.

125
00:04:58,929 --> 00:05:01,568
- Yes. - I won.

126
00:05:01,698 --> 00:05:02,767
(He wins a prize.)

127
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:04,938
- I got it. - Let's go.

128
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,908
- Let's go. - Did he get it?

129
00:05:06,909 --> 00:05:07,968
- Wait. - I got it.

130
00:05:07,969 --> 00:05:08,969
I still have more time.

131
00:05:09,469 --> 00:05:10,609
I got it.

132
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:12,038
I got it.

133
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:13,877
(They can move onto the next destination.)

134
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:15,008
I don't want to waste it.

135
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,279
Keep playing.

136
00:05:17,018 --> 00:05:19,058
(Since I already paid, let me play one more round.)

137
00:05:19,148 --> 00:05:21,048
I definitely got it.

138
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:22,049
You got one?

139
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:24,457
- I think so. - Seung Ho.

140
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,258
Yes, I got it.

141
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:27,388
I won.

142
00:05:27,558 --> 00:05:28,558
I got it.

143
00:05:29,089 --> 00:05:30,928
- This is addicting. - I got it again.

144
00:05:30,929 --> 00:05:31,929
(A perfect success)

145
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,398
I'd be grateful to win one more.

146
00:05:35,198 --> 00:05:36,397
I'd be grateful to win one more.

147
00:05:36,398 --> 00:05:39,068
(You can leave now.)

148
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,109
(He's a slave to dopamine.)

149
00:05:41,239 --> 00:05:42,338
How many times did you pay?

150
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:44,108
- Three times. - That's nice and neat.

151
00:05:44,109 --> 00:05:46,208
Hey, this is addicting.

152
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:48,908
It's addicting. I feel a rush of dopamine.

153
00:05:48,909 --> 00:05:49,979
(Is he already addicted?)

154
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:51,549
I can't do it.

155
00:05:52,179 --> 00:05:53,549
(Grinning)

156
00:05:54,148 --> 00:05:55,148
Just one more.

157
00:05:55,148 --> 00:05:56,148
(Desperate)

158
00:05:56,919 --> 00:05:58,388
Kyung Ho, what's your son's name?

159
00:05:58,518 --> 00:05:59,558
Yi Yoon.

160
00:06:00,888 --> 00:06:03,729
(Yi Kyung wants to win one more and give it to Kyung Ho.)

161
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:06,928
I'd be grateful if I win one more.

162
00:06:06,929 --> 00:06:08,928
- I got it! - You got it?

163
00:06:08,929 --> 00:06:10,368
- It's for his son. - Let's go.

164
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:11,997
I also won one for his son.

165
00:06:11,998 --> 00:06:13,068
Let's go, Kyung Ho.

166
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:14,438
- Kyung Ho. - Your card.

167
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:16,507
- Here's your card. - Thank you.

168
00:06:16,508 --> 00:06:18,207
- Let's go. - These are for your children.

169
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,408
- Thank you. - The mission...

170
00:06:19,409 --> 00:06:20,577
- Let's go now. - The mission.

171
00:06:20,578 --> 00:06:22,248
(Cleared the mission in 5 minutes)

172
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,588
- We didn't even take ten minutes. - Let's go.

173
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:26,687
(It makes them sing.)

174
00:06:26,688 --> 00:06:28,817
Kyung Ho, you have two children.

175
00:06:28,818 --> 00:06:30,518
I'm glad to have teamed up with you two.

176
00:06:31,688 --> 00:06:35,388
(Where they arrive with holding two ducks)

177
00:06:35,688 --> 00:06:36,698
It used to be...

178
00:06:37,328 --> 00:06:38,627
a gukbap restaurant, but it changed.

179
00:06:38,628 --> 00:06:39,628
(An ordinary commercial building in Seongnam)

180
00:06:39,629 --> 00:06:40,869
This is your hometown.

181
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:44,137
(Seongnam B: Unusual Animals)

182
00:06:44,138 --> 00:06:45,299
So this is the place.

183
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:46,637
"Insect harmony?"

184
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:48,968
(What kind of content creator will they meet here?)

185
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:50,078
This is the place.

186
00:06:55,779 --> 00:06:59,849
(It's full of unusual animals.)

187
00:07:00,489 --> 00:07:03,458
(The one who handles reptiles the best in Korea is here.)

188
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:08,659
(Handsome Heritage 4: The world is big with many living things.)

189
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:10,997
- Hello. - Hello.

190
00:07:10,998 --> 00:07:12,099
Hello.

191
00:07:12,258 --> 00:07:13,529
I'm a big fan of yours.

192
00:07:13,929 --> 00:07:16,028
- He's a celebrity. - I enjoy your videos.

193
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:17,137
Hello.

194
00:07:17,138 --> 00:07:18,767
I'm your big fan. May I take a photo with you later?

195
00:07:18,768 --> 00:07:19,938
- Okay. - Goodness.

196
00:07:19,969 --> 00:07:21,869
I'm blushing all of a sudden.

197
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:24,778
Could you briefly introduce yourself to our viewers?

198
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,478
I'm Jungbrre, a creature content creator.

199
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,708
- Nice to meet you. - You too.

200
00:07:28,549 --> 00:07:29,918
How many subscribers do you have?

201
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:32,817
As of today, I have 1.41 million subscribers.

202
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:33,848
(A YouTuber of 1.41 million subscribers)

203
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:35,887
- Congratulations. - One of them is my son.

204
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:36,888
Really?

205
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:39,434
(As a creature content creator of 1.41 million subscribers, )

206
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:42,489
(he explains how to take care of unusual animals.)

207
00:07:42,888 --> 00:07:46,599
(He went abroad to the Amazon, Suriname, and Australia.)

208
00:07:46,869 --> 00:07:49,598
(He meets unusual animals all over the world.)

209
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:50,599
(Subscribers, 1.41 million)

210
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,508
(A creature content creator with 1.41 million subscribers)

211
00:07:53,869 --> 00:07:55,238
- Shall I give you a tour? - Yes.

212
00:07:55,239 --> 00:07:56,577
- Yes. - Shall we start right away?

213
00:07:56,578 --> 00:07:58,578
- That sounds good. - Please do.

214
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,679
First of all,

215
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:04,978
this is my favourite lizard.

216
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,178
- Lizard? - Yes.

217
00:08:06,179 --> 00:08:08,719
It's a quite expensive lizard from Africa.

218
00:08:09,049 --> 00:08:13,258
It's called armadillo girdled lizard.

219
00:08:13,359 --> 00:08:15,188
- "Armadillo?" - Armadillo.

220
00:08:15,258 --> 00:08:17,058
I'll open the cage and show you.

221
00:08:17,128 --> 00:08:18,159
Really?

222
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:22,067
Does he not bite?

223
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:23,568
No, he's very gentle.

224
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:26,568
These lizards live in Africa.

225
00:08:27,438 --> 00:08:29,738
They're very expensive and rare.

226
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:32,508
You said that they're expensive. What's the price exactly?

227
00:08:32,578 --> 00:08:34,008
About 10,000 dollars per lizard.

228
00:08:34,508 --> 00:08:35,748
It costs about 10,000 dollars.

229
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,348
There are 2, so do they cost 20,000 dollars?

230
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:39,918
Yes, they're a pair.

231
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,757
They have a unique ability.

232
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:45,459
- They have an ability? - Yes.

233
00:08:45,719 --> 00:08:46,788
I'll show you.

234
00:08:47,888 --> 00:08:50,599
I grew over ten of them, but only he does it.

235
00:08:51,758 --> 00:08:53,369
Take a look.

236
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,398
He's biting his tail.

237
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:00,239
- Like this. - He's biting it so hard.

238
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:02,507
- Are you okay? - Yes.

239
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,238
I didn't train him to do this.

240
00:09:04,239 --> 00:09:06,008
He's taking a posture of defence.

241
00:09:06,109 --> 00:09:09,547
There's a dragon called Ouroboros in a myth.

242
00:09:09,548 --> 00:09:11,548
He's taking that form.

243
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:13,148
All right.

244
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:17,318
He's taking a posture of defence.

245
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:18,388
Do it one more time.

246
00:09:19,319 --> 00:09:20,329
Like that?

247
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:22,734
He understands you, and he's staying still.

248
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:25,328
He makes himself round like a wheel.

249
00:09:25,329 --> 00:09:27,829
It's to run away like a rolling stone.

250
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:33,439
There's a frog that I love.

251
00:09:33,469 --> 00:09:34,739
- A frog? - Do you see it?

252
00:09:35,969 --> 00:09:36,978
- It's huge. - Goodness!

253
00:09:36,979 --> 00:09:38,208
I'm sorry. I got startled.

254
00:09:38,209 --> 00:09:40,490
- That startled and scared me. - It's a giant pixie frog.

255
00:09:41,508 --> 00:09:43,517
- Giant pixie frog. - I thought that it was a stone.

256
00:09:43,518 --> 00:09:45,849
- It's alive. - Alive?

257
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:47,848
- Would you like to touch it? - No.

258
00:09:47,849 --> 00:09:49,089
I can't touch frogs.

259
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:51,358
I can touch lizards, but...

260
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,565
I've never seen anything like this.

261
00:09:52,589 --> 00:09:56,189
This frog is from Africa as well.

262
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:58,559
It's called a giant pixie frog.

263
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:00,898
He's not fully grown.

264
00:10:01,099 --> 00:10:02,198
- What? - Yes.

265
00:10:02,199 --> 00:10:03,637
He isn't giant yet?

266
00:10:03,638 --> 00:10:04,868
How big does he get?

267
00:10:04,869 --> 00:10:07,507
They usually weigh from 1.5kg to 1.8kg.

268
00:10:07,508 --> 00:10:09,809
Sometimes, they can weigh as much as 3kg.

269
00:10:10,038 --> 00:10:11,079
So two times more?

270
00:10:11,508 --> 00:10:12,948
Yes, I'll take him out and show you.

271
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:15,048
He's gentle.

272
00:10:17,479 --> 00:10:19,877
Gosh, you scared me. Stop it.

273
00:10:19,878 --> 00:10:21,548
What if he jumps up suddenly?

274
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:23,188
- Isn't he cute? - He could jump.

275
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:24,288
He's cute, but...

276
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:25,988
May I...

277
00:10:25,989 --> 00:10:28,228
May I try...

278
00:10:28,229 --> 00:10:29,858
to touch him lightly?

279
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:30,897
You said that you were good at touching animals.

280
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:33,198
Frogs scare me the most.

281
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,028
- A moment ago... - I can touch snakes.

282
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:37,137
I can touch anything except frogs,

283
00:10:37,138 --> 00:10:38,397
but he's so big.

284
00:10:38,398 --> 00:10:40,068
Just don't touch near his mouth.

285
00:10:40,069 --> 00:10:41,809
Even if you touch his mouth, he won't bite.

286
00:10:43,069 --> 00:10:44,738
- Isn't it best to touch the back? - Yes.

287
00:10:44,739 --> 00:10:45,938
Go ahead and touch him.

288
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:47,648
(Patting)

289
00:10:48,908 --> 00:10:51,048
It feels like touching an old person's head.

290
00:10:52,048 --> 00:10:54,048
I touched my grandfather's head when I was young.

291
00:10:54,489 --> 00:10:57,787
- How does he look so relaxed? - To keep the moisture...

292
00:10:57,788 --> 00:10:59,488
He's cute. His feet are cute too.

293
00:10:59,489 --> 00:11:01,359
His toes are very cute.

294
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,927
Don't be scared to touch him.

295
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:05,258
- Try and touch him. - Aren't his feet adorable?

296
00:11:05,428 --> 00:11:07,498
Look, the toes look adorable.

297
00:11:08,998 --> 00:11:10,198
It feels like a balloon that's slightly inflated.

298
00:11:10,199 --> 00:11:11,369
Doesn't he feel thick?

299
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,137
Is it a gentle species by nature?

300
00:11:14,138 --> 00:11:15,568
No.

301
00:11:15,569 --> 00:11:18,208
In nature, whenever something moves in front of him,

302
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:20,677
- he eats snakes, crayfish, - What?

303
00:11:20,678 --> 00:11:21,708
And mice.

304
00:11:21,709 --> 00:11:23,479
- He eats mice? - He eats everything.

305
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:29,647
- Give me fifty superworms, please. - Fifty?

306
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,788
Does he eat 50 superworms?

307
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:33,658
He eats a lot.

308
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,165
- I'll give them to him. - I want to take a look up close.

309
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:38,398
- I won't get this chance again. - Are you filming it?

310
00:11:40,428 --> 00:11:41,869
I don't know if he'll eat.

311
00:11:42,729 --> 00:11:44,098
(What...)

312
00:11:44,099 --> 00:11:45,497
(will be the result?)

313
00:11:45,498 --> 00:11:46,568
Is he conscious of the camera?

314
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:47,569
(Surprised)

315
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:48,609
He has a huge tongue.

316
00:11:52,008 --> 00:11:53,109
(Gulping)

317
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,348
(I mistook him for being cute for a moment.)

318
00:12:02,349 --> 00:12:03,658
His tongue is very thick.

319
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:08,127
(I'll feed him again.)

320
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,128
Sir, is he...

321
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:15,868
He has a big mouth and a big tongue.

322
00:12:15,869 --> 00:12:16,869
Yes.

323
00:12:17,298 --> 00:12:19,767
Is there any species that you definitely want to show us?

324
00:12:19,768 --> 00:12:20,809
It's over there.

325
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:25,008
It's a turtle that's different...

326
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,178
from regular ones.

327
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:27,178
- What? - Gosh.

328
00:12:27,378 --> 00:12:28,754
- Do you see it? - It looks like a fossil.

329
00:12:28,778 --> 00:12:29,849
What's this?

330
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,248
This is from the Amazon.

331
00:12:34,648 --> 00:12:36,718
The Amazon that you're familiar with.

332
00:12:36,719 --> 00:12:38,558
- Is that the face? - Doesn't he look strange?

333
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,688
He looks fascinating.

334
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:42,387
It's called matamata turtle.

335
00:12:42,388 --> 00:12:43,657
Matamata turtle?

336
00:12:43,658 --> 00:12:46,828
When you look closely at his back,

337
00:12:46,829 --> 00:12:50,569
it looks like a fallen leaf or some type of structure.

338
00:12:50,768 --> 00:12:52,938
The colour of water in his natural habitat...

339
00:12:52,939 --> 00:12:54,168
is yellowish brown.

340
00:12:54,469 --> 00:12:56,267
So he's invisible underwater.

341
00:12:56,268 --> 00:12:57,507
(He hides in yellowish brown water and hunts his prey.)

342
00:12:57,508 --> 00:12:59,908
He waits for the prey to get close to him.

343
00:13:00,508 --> 00:13:03,108
He sucks in the water...

344
00:13:03,109 --> 00:13:05,449
and gulps down all the fish in one go.

345
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:09,188
- I'll take him out. - Goodness.

346
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:10,418
He looks very rare.

347
00:13:10,518 --> 00:13:12,319
I bet he's expensive too.

348
00:13:15,028 --> 00:13:16,998
That's very fascinating.

349
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:19,359
He looks similar to an alligator.

350
00:13:21,099 --> 00:13:22,728
I can't tell where his eyes are.

351
00:13:22,729 --> 00:13:24,638
- They're here. - Over there in the front?

352
00:13:24,898 --> 00:13:26,839
These are his eyes and nose.

353
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:30,168
- It's the mouth. - His facial features are unusual.

354
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:32,479
This part looks like sea cucumber.

355
00:13:32,979 --> 00:13:34,448
He does look like a sea cucumber.

356
00:13:34,449 --> 00:13:35,548
Just the appearance.

357
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:38,648
Kyung Ho isn't scared to touch.

358
00:13:38,778 --> 00:13:39,978
I'm so curious.

359
00:13:39,979 --> 00:13:42,719
Thank you. Put him back in the water so he can breathe.

360
00:13:42,849 --> 00:13:43,988
Yes.

361
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,318
He's breathing now.

362
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:49,089
We got to look at creatures that we never saw before...

363
00:13:50,158 --> 00:13:51,229
Yongin.

364
00:13:52,628 --> 00:13:54,628
We've been there, so I'm not surprised.

365
00:13:54,729 --> 00:13:56,268
They got Yongin.

366
00:13:56,369 --> 00:13:58,445
- If you give us a sticker... - They answered the quiz.

367
00:13:58,469 --> 00:14:00,068
At this rate, we must answer correctly...

368
00:14:00,069 --> 00:14:01,938
and get ahead one by one.

369
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:03,008
(Current score, 2:2)

370
00:14:03,138 --> 00:14:05,479
I wonder where they'll head next.

371
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:09,678
We don't have to worry about this line, right?

372
00:14:09,778 --> 00:14:10,918
We're here now.

373
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:15,548
(They feel certain that the other team didn't win the center square.)

374
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:20,787
(Will their prediction be correct?)

375
00:14:20,788 --> 00:14:23,459
(Anyway, it's time to shoot a video.)

376
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:25,427
With the light?

377
00:14:25,428 --> 00:14:27,298
- This is how you shoot. - Yes.

378
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:29,469
Since I'm filming a YouTube video,

379
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,667
- can I make a brief introduction? - Sure.

380
00:14:32,668 --> 00:14:34,939
- Hello. - Hello.

381
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:37,338
This is Lee Yi Kyung.

382
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:39,478
- Hello, I'm Shin Seung Ho. - Hello.

383
00:14:39,479 --> 00:14:41,579
Hello, everyone. I'm Yoon Kyung Ho.

384
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:45,677
I didn't expect to be on YouTube with you.

385
00:14:45,678 --> 00:14:49,849
I set up a breeding cage for tarantulas for today.

386
00:14:49,949 --> 00:14:53,188
We'll move a couple in here.

387
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:55,758
(The final goal: Moving a tarantula couple)

388
00:14:55,989 --> 00:14:58,158
- First of all... - Tarantulas?

389
00:14:58,398 --> 00:14:59,459
- Yes. - Tarantulas?

390
00:15:00,369 --> 00:15:02,198
- Spiders.. - Let me show you first.

391
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:04,039
I'll tell you what type of tarantula they are.

392
00:15:04,668 --> 00:15:05,897
Gosh, that startled me.

393
00:15:05,898 --> 00:15:07,138
What's wrong with you?

394
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:11,608
- Is that actual spider silk? - Yes.

395
00:15:11,609 --> 00:15:13,438
It sounds like you're tearing paper.

396
00:15:13,439 --> 00:15:14,849
- Do you want to touch it? - No.

397
00:15:15,048 --> 00:15:16,777
- Spider webs are okay. - I'll touch that.

398
00:15:16,778 --> 00:15:19,418
It's spider silk from the tarantulas.

399
00:15:19,719 --> 00:15:21,189
It's very soft.

400
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,489
Isn't it soft?

401
00:15:23,319 --> 00:15:24,388
You're right.

402
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:26,458
It's okay to touch because there's no poison.

403
00:15:26,819 --> 00:15:28,188
Are these tarantulas not poisonous?

404
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:29,257
They are.

405
00:15:29,258 --> 00:15:30,658
This one is poisonous.

406
00:15:31,758 --> 00:15:34,028
- It's poisonous? - Have you heard...

407
00:15:34,128 --> 00:15:36,497
- of "Pirates of the Caribbean?" - Yes.

408
00:15:36,498 --> 00:15:38,698
These tarantulas are from the Caribbean.

409
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,315
(These tarantulas are from the Caribbean.)

410
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,869
How did they end up in South Korea?

411
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:45,177
There's something we have to do.

412
00:15:45,178 --> 00:15:47,007
- What? - I need help from one of you.

413
00:15:47,008 --> 00:15:48,848
- Who would like to... - Seung Ho volunteered.

414
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:51,377
- Did I volunteer? - Seung Ho?

415
00:15:51,378 --> 00:15:52,578
You said in the car...

416
00:15:52,579 --> 00:15:53,825
- that you'd do everything. - I meant snakes.

417
00:15:53,849 --> 00:15:56,088
- I didn't imagine tarantulas. - Come on.

418
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,189
I will do it.

419
00:15:57,258 --> 00:15:59,689
(Thank you, Seung Ho.)

420
00:15:59,819 --> 00:16:03,157
You'll set up the cage with leaves.

421
00:16:03,158 --> 00:16:04,698
It's very simple.

422
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:06,559
- First... - Were they selected for the house?

423
00:16:06,928 --> 00:16:08,329
These tarantulas are...

424
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,568
arboreal.

425
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:14,339
Tarantulas are either terrestrial, fossorial, or arboreal.

426
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:17,478
- Arboreal tarantulas live on trees. - Arboreal?

427
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:21,309
That's why I prepared a cage that's vertically high.

428
00:16:22,178 --> 00:16:23,579
Shall I put this in?

429
00:16:25,748 --> 00:16:28,719
In tarantulas' natural habitat,

430
00:16:28,849 --> 00:16:33,219
there are various tropical plants.

431
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:35,989
This is red clay and flooring material.

432
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:37,958
Pour all of them in.

433
00:16:37,959 --> 00:16:40,157
Mix them and cover the bottom of the cage.

434
00:16:40,158 --> 00:16:41,328
Should I mix with my hand?

435
00:16:41,329 --> 00:16:42,829
Yes, please.

436
00:16:48,638 --> 00:16:51,078
Why are you changing their cage?

437
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:53,608
Is it time to change,

438
00:16:53,609 --> 00:16:55,309
or is this their first cage here?

439
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:57,818
These tarantulas are newlyweds.

440
00:16:57,819 --> 00:16:59,818
This is for breeding.

441
00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:01,448
After setting this up,

442
00:17:01,449 --> 00:17:02,688
you'll be able to see...

443
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,158
how tarantulas mate.

444
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:05,887
I never thought about spiders mating.

445
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:07,458
I'll show you.

446
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:08,588
By the way...

447
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:10,527
Do they mate when you tell them to mate?

448
00:17:10,528 --> 00:17:12,257
No, I don't tell them.

449
00:17:12,258 --> 00:17:14,268
You put those who are ready at the same time.

450
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:16,127
Once you sense that,

451
00:17:16,128 --> 00:17:17,968
you can make an attempt.

452
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:20,268
That's fascinating.

453
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:23,168
I'll open the cage. Can you move one?

454
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:25,539
- Me? - Of course.

455
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,608
Take it out and put it in?

456
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:28,748
- Yes. - I put it in?

457
00:17:28,749 --> 00:17:29,779
Right in front of you.

458
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,378
(Sighing)

459
00:17:33,257 --> 00:17:34,426
You're wearing gloves.

460
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:36,356
No, use the pincers.

461
00:17:36,556 --> 00:17:38,196
Were you about to grab it with your hand?

462
00:17:38,697 --> 00:17:39,697
(Smiling)

463
00:17:39,698 --> 00:17:41,026
- I mean... - No.

464
00:17:41,027 --> 00:17:42,196
He has a sense of humour.

465
00:17:42,197 --> 00:17:43,797
We should invite him as a guest.

466
00:17:44,366 --> 00:17:47,095
Instead of grabbing them like an insect with the pincers,

467
00:17:47,096 --> 00:17:48,565
push them slightly...

468
00:17:48,566 --> 00:17:50,312
- in the right direction. - You have to lead them.

469
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,977
- I'll send it this way. - Okay.

470
00:17:52,207 --> 00:17:53,876
He looks angry.

471
00:17:54,007 --> 00:17:55,776
Like this.

472
00:17:55,777 --> 00:17:57,916
Go this way.

473
00:17:58,316 --> 00:17:59,345
Should I hold it?

474
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:02,047
Push it lightly and lead the way.

475
00:18:02,386 --> 00:18:04,386
- While tapping it lightly? - That's how to do it.

476
00:18:04,517 --> 00:18:06,815
Push any part of the spider slowly.

477
00:18:06,816 --> 00:18:08,526
Tap it gently like a baby.

478
00:18:08,527 --> 00:18:10,326
- Slowly and gently. - Please go.

479
00:18:10,386 --> 00:18:12,356
- Please. - Go.

480
00:18:12,457 --> 00:18:15,026
This is your new home.

481
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,537
Ma'am, please go in. That's your house.

482
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,395
Ma'am, please go in.

483
00:18:19,396 --> 00:18:20,707
That's your house.

484
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:22,007
Don't come out, ma'am.

485
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:25,507
Please go in.

486
00:18:25,937 --> 00:18:27,423
- Yes, that's it. - You're doing well.

487
00:18:27,447 --> 00:18:28,707
Goodness.

488
00:18:29,047 --> 00:18:30,146
You got it.

489
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:32,476
- Is it normal to sweat like this? - Good job.

490
00:18:32,477 --> 00:18:34,146
You're making me sweat too.

491
00:18:35,017 --> 00:18:36,085
Shall I move the male?

492
00:18:36,086 --> 00:18:37,246
- Yes. - That sounds good.

493
00:18:37,247 --> 00:18:39,517
Let's increase the level.

494
00:18:39,816 --> 00:18:42,186
- The female is inside. - All of a sudden?

495
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:45,027
Place the male near the female and make them see each other.

496
00:18:45,797 --> 00:18:47,825
- So they look at each other. - You will be...

497
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:49,526
- the matchmaker. - In that case,

498
00:18:49,527 --> 00:18:51,365
shouldn't we sing?

499
00:18:51,366 --> 00:18:52,467
- Sing? - Sing?

500
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,506
(Should I sing?)

501
00:18:54,507 --> 00:18:56,507
Oh, Handsome Guys

502
00:18:57,737 --> 00:18:59,075
Kyung Ho, you can sing.

503
00:18:59,076 --> 00:19:01,346
(Soon, it becomes romantic in the cage.)

504
00:19:01,646 --> 00:19:03,207
(I love it.)

505
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:07,415
- We are - Goodness.

506
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,487
Hey.

507
00:19:09,247 --> 00:19:11,116
They're going to meet now.

508
00:19:11,386 --> 00:19:13,086
One meter before meeting her.

509
00:19:16,027 --> 00:19:18,326
The spider in search

510
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,227
You shouldn't come up.

511
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:21,767
Sir, please go down.

512
00:19:21,967 --> 00:19:23,866
Isn't it slightly hard to control them?

513
00:19:24,027 --> 00:19:25,696
This is very hard.

514
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:29,365
- I don't want to hurt... - My gosh.

515
00:19:29,366 --> 00:19:31,406
Sir, I cannot do this anymore.

516
00:19:31,707 --> 00:19:33,306
Why aren't you listening?

517
00:19:33,937 --> 00:19:36,506
Is it moving like that because it feels threatened?

518
00:19:36,507 --> 00:19:38,777
Do you see this movement?

519
00:19:38,816 --> 00:19:42,186
It's trying to understand the structure in the front.

520
00:19:42,187 --> 00:19:44,155
- It's making spider silk. - Yes.

521
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:46,155
When it smells a female,

522
00:19:46,156 --> 00:19:48,325
it shoots out spider silk to look for the female.

523
00:19:48,326 --> 00:19:49,933
(Searching while shooting out spider silk)

524
00:19:49,957 --> 00:19:52,625
Shall I take them out and show you here?

525
00:19:52,626 --> 00:19:54,326
- You mean, mating? - I'll try.

526
00:19:54,566 --> 00:19:56,197
I mean...

527
00:19:56,297 --> 00:19:58,536
- Making love is... - The mating...

528
00:19:58,537 --> 00:19:59,996
a beautiful thing, but...

529
00:19:59,997 --> 00:20:01,135
Here's one thing.

530
00:20:01,136 --> 00:20:03,665
They have extremely poor eyesight.

531
00:20:03,666 --> 00:20:04,983
(Tarantulas barely have eyesight.)

532
00:20:05,007 --> 00:20:07,606
- That's a relief. - It feels like lights are out.

533
00:20:09,646 --> 00:20:10,875
(The specialist does it in one try.)

534
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,315
- It came up right away. - All right.

535
00:20:12,316 --> 00:20:13,616
Stay right there.

536
00:20:14,487 --> 00:20:15,586
Everyone.

537
00:20:16,116 --> 00:20:18,085
- The spiders are... - Where else would we see this?

538
00:20:18,086 --> 00:20:19,186
Just about to mate.

539
00:20:19,187 --> 00:20:21,826
(The first time on TV)

540
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,396
It's approaching.

541
00:20:26,297 --> 00:20:28,797
They're starting to mate.

542
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,037
They hit it off.

543
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:37,976
The one that's going underneath is male.

544
00:20:37,977 --> 00:20:39,605
If you look closely,

545
00:20:39,606 --> 00:20:41,846
you'll see its small legs moving quickly.

546
00:20:42,406 --> 00:20:45,246
- That's the male's... - Reproductive organ?

547
00:20:45,247 --> 00:20:46,416
Yes, that's it.

548
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:48,346
- Is it on the legs? - Yes.

549
00:20:48,517 --> 00:20:49,687
On top of that,

550
00:20:50,187 --> 00:20:51,315
it has two organs.

551
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,786
You're watching so intently.

552
00:20:52,787 --> 00:20:55,626
- Are they not fighting? - I know.

553
00:20:55,856 --> 00:20:58,356
Once you put them in their new house,

554
00:20:58,427 --> 00:21:01,125
they'll settle down after mating.

555
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,126
- Will it lay eggs? - Yes.

556
00:21:03,366 --> 00:21:05,166
That's so fascinating.

557
00:21:05,237 --> 00:21:06,936
Congratulations on mating.

558
00:21:06,937 --> 00:21:08,013
(Congratulations on mating.)

559
00:21:08,037 --> 00:21:10,506
We watched such a rare scene.

560
00:21:10,507 --> 00:21:11,676
We also made their home.

561
00:21:11,677 --> 00:21:12,905
- Thank you. - Can you talk...

562
00:21:12,906 --> 00:21:15,805
- to my son on video call? - Sure.

563
00:21:15,806 --> 00:21:16,806
Hello.

564
00:21:17,717 --> 00:21:18,976
Hi.

565
00:21:18,977 --> 00:21:20,115
Say hello.

566
00:21:20,116 --> 00:21:22,187
- Hello. - What's your name?

567
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:23,717
- Yi Yoon. - Yi Yoon?

568
00:21:23,947 --> 00:21:25,356
Yi Yoon, what are you eating?

569
00:21:25,386 --> 00:21:26,717
Yi Yoon, do you recognize him?

570
00:21:27,856 --> 00:21:29,927
- Who is it? - Jungbrre.

571
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:32,396
(Moved)

572
00:21:32,427 --> 00:21:33,556
Nice to meet you.

573
00:21:34,427 --> 00:21:35,825
- Okay. - He seems embarrassed.

574
00:21:35,826 --> 00:21:37,165
All right.

575
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:38,466
He's showing you that he has your book.

576
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:40,396
"Jungbrre's Amazon Journal?"

577
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:42,105
Thank you.

578
00:21:42,106 --> 00:21:43,206
Thank you.

579
00:21:43,207 --> 00:21:44,905
- He got his wish granted. - Thank you.

580
00:21:44,906 --> 00:21:46,906
- Thank you very much. - Thank you so much.

581
00:21:47,037 --> 00:21:48,405
Thank you for coming.

582
00:21:48,406 --> 00:21:49,777
(Time for Quiz)

583
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:52,947
Our ancestors in the past...

584
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:56,547
predicted the weather based on animals' behaviour.

585
00:21:56,886 --> 00:22:00,017
When swallows flew low, it was a sign for bad weather.

586
00:22:00,086 --> 00:22:03,326
The cries of green frogs indicated that it was about to rain.

587
00:22:04,396 --> 00:22:05,556
What did it signify...

588
00:22:06,156 --> 00:22:08,665
when honeybees made the entrance...

589
00:22:08,666 --> 00:22:12,865
of their beehive smaller than normal?

590
00:22:12,866 --> 00:22:15,106
(Honeybees making the entrance of their beehive smaller)

591
00:22:15,537 --> 00:22:16,706
How about this?

592
00:22:16,707 --> 00:22:18,677
If the beehive entrance is big,

593
00:22:18,836 --> 00:22:22,375
more honey would evaporate.

594
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:24,007
They make it small...

595
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,916
to prepare for a drought.

596
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,787
To reserve as much honey as possible...

597
00:22:29,947 --> 00:22:31,555
I also thought about drought...

598
00:22:31,556 --> 00:22:33,257
or rainfall.

599
00:22:33,487 --> 00:22:36,325
- I also wrote those down. - Flood.

600
00:22:36,326 --> 00:22:37,756
- Flood. - Rainfall.

601
00:22:37,757 --> 00:22:39,956
Why would they make it small...

602
00:22:39,957 --> 00:22:42,027
for an increase of rainfall?

603
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:44,665
- When the rainfall increases... - If they don't make it small,

604
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:45,996
- Water might go in? - water will go in.

605
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,496
The beehive would be flooded.

606
00:22:47,497 --> 00:22:49,565
Because rain would fall onto it?

607
00:22:49,566 --> 00:22:52,105
That would make sense if the entrance was on top.

608
00:22:52,106 --> 00:22:53,437
Can we ask about that?

609
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:56,145
Is the entrance of a beehive...

610
00:22:56,146 --> 00:22:57,676
on top or bottom?

611
00:22:57,677 --> 00:23:00,645
Do you know if the hole is on top or at the bottom?

612
00:23:00,646 --> 00:23:02,085
It's at the bottom of the facade.

613
00:23:02,086 --> 00:23:03,585
- At the bottom? - On the facade.

614
00:23:03,586 --> 00:23:05,556
Instead of the rain...

615
00:23:06,356 --> 00:23:07,987
- If there's a drought, - Exactly.

616
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,656
Flowers won't bloom easily.

617
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,325
- Even the trees... - Right.

618
00:23:11,326 --> 00:23:12,826
- like acacia trees. - You're right.

619
00:23:12,957 --> 00:23:14,496
Why would they make the entrance small?

620
00:23:14,497 --> 00:23:15,697
That's what we need to know.

621
00:23:15,997 --> 00:23:17,095
Shouldn't they work harder if there's a drought?

622
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:19,095
They should collect more honey faster.

623
00:23:19,096 --> 00:23:21,666
They probably work in shifts.

624
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:23,266
- Either way, - If there's a drought...

625
00:23:23,267 --> 00:23:24,405
Many of them won't go in and out?

626
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:26,206
If there are 100 bees, all 100 don't need to go out.

627
00:23:26,207 --> 00:23:28,706
Let's say that they can only harvest 50 percent.

628
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:30,806
By making the entrance small,

629
00:23:30,906 --> 00:23:33,345
having only 50 bees working would be enough.

630
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:34,947
The drought sounds likely.

631
00:23:35,287 --> 00:23:37,216
Let's say the answer now.

632
00:23:37,217 --> 00:23:39,362
- Shall we hear the question again? - How about the opposite?

633
00:23:39,386 --> 00:23:40,585
Let's say that they have a lot of honey.

634
00:23:40,586 --> 00:23:41,787
It drips everywhere.

635
00:23:42,457 --> 00:23:44,856
Maybe that's why they make the entrance smaller.

636
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:46,937
- Because the honey leaks out? - Yes.

637
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:48,866
Then...

638
00:23:50,126 --> 00:23:52,997
Won't it leak if the entrance is small?

639
00:23:53,297 --> 00:23:55,236
Even honeybees can pass through.

640
00:23:55,237 --> 00:23:56,336
(Laughing)

641
00:23:57,237 --> 00:23:58,806
I know the answer.

642
00:23:59,306 --> 00:24:02,345
Due to the difference in rainfall from the usual.

643
00:24:02,346 --> 00:24:03,906
- Yes. - The rainfall...

644
00:24:04,007 --> 00:24:05,075
It has to be right.

645
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:06,546
- Isn't the rainfall correct? - That's exactly right.

646
00:24:06,547 --> 00:24:08,017
We got the answer.

647
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:11,316
Due to the difference in rainfall from the usual.

648
00:24:11,757 --> 00:24:13,155
Whether it's more or less,

649
00:24:13,156 --> 00:24:14,996
- there's a difference. - Give us the sticker.

650
00:24:15,826 --> 00:24:16,987
To stick it right away.

651
00:24:17,797 --> 00:24:19,257
Due to the difference in rainfall,

652
00:24:19,556 --> 00:24:20,825
they made the entrance small?

653
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,696
(Due to the difference in rainfall from the usual)

654
00:24:22,697 --> 00:24:23,767
Incorrect.

655
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:28,536
(Laughing)

656
00:24:28,537 --> 00:24:30,207
I guess it's wrong. What's the answer?

657
00:24:31,066 --> 00:24:33,037
It means that the upcoming winter will be cold.

658
00:24:33,677 --> 00:24:34,846
The upcoming winter?

659
00:24:35,376 --> 00:24:36,776
They make the entrance small...

660
00:24:36,777 --> 00:24:38,246
to prevent the temperature...

661
00:24:38,247 --> 00:24:41,116
in the beehive from falling rapidly.

662
00:24:41,316 --> 00:24:43,315
(Bummed out)

663
00:24:43,316 --> 00:24:44,316
They're smart.

664
00:24:44,317 --> 00:24:46,386
Let's be honest. It was a hard question.

665
00:24:47,386 --> 00:24:48,786
Why did we only think about the summer?

666
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:49,787
This is...

667
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:50,856
(Laughing)

668
00:24:51,856 --> 00:24:53,196
We were completely off.

669
00:24:53,197 --> 00:24:54,497
This was impossible to guess.

670
00:24:55,297 --> 00:24:58,065
Wait, we got it wrong here.

671
00:24:58,066 --> 00:25:00,135
It's better to make them come here and fail...

672
00:25:00,136 --> 00:25:01,805
instead of going somewhere else.

673
00:25:01,806 --> 00:25:03,135
We need to leave here.

674
00:25:03,136 --> 00:25:04,876
I took down notes a while ago.

675
00:25:06,376 --> 00:25:08,646
The other team used their nap card.

676
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:11,646
(The other team used their 30-minute nap card.)

677
00:25:14,177 --> 00:25:15,385
This is how it happens.

678
00:25:15,386 --> 00:25:18,286
(Getting punched in a row)

679
00:25:18,287 --> 00:25:20,916
Please put Team Handsome to sleep.

680
00:25:21,356 --> 00:25:22,585
They need to sleep now.

681
00:25:22,586 --> 00:25:23,886
(Making an attack)

682
00:25:24,126 --> 00:25:25,296
We'll tell them.

683
00:25:25,297 --> 00:25:27,757
(They freeze the opponents.)

684
00:25:29,427 --> 00:25:31,736
I wonder where they went.

685
00:25:31,737 --> 00:25:34,267
If they went to Yangpyeong, it'd be over for us.

686
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:35,866
Let's see.

687
00:25:36,106 --> 00:25:37,706
What time will we arrive in Yangpyeong?

688
00:25:37,707 --> 00:25:39,006
It will take 1 hour and 20 minutes.

689
00:25:39,007 --> 00:25:40,483
(Team Guys are on their way to Yangpyeong.)

690
00:25:40,507 --> 00:25:42,406
If we fail in Yangpyeong,

691
00:25:42,906 --> 00:25:44,375
it'd be hard for us to win.

692
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,575
Yes, it'd be hard to win.

693
00:25:46,576 --> 00:25:48,016
In Pocheon or Yangju,

694
00:25:48,017 --> 00:25:50,187
we'd have one more chance.

695
00:25:50,386 --> 00:25:52,115
We still have two more chances.

696
00:25:52,116 --> 00:25:55,786
We'll try to win the bingo in Yangpyeong.

697
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:59,156
(They try to win the bingo in Yangpyeong.)

698
00:25:59,927 --> 00:26:01,626
For the countryside meal,

699
00:26:02,596 --> 00:26:05,036
it's either made by an elderly lady.

700
00:26:05,037 --> 00:26:06,065
Yes.

701
00:26:06,066 --> 00:26:07,966
Or something like bibimbap with wild vegetables.

702
00:26:07,967 --> 00:26:10,636
Yes, I watched videos of countryside meal on YouTube.

703
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,707
Skilled granny home cook, 280,000 subscribers.

704
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:17,306
There are only videos of eating.

705
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:21,316
"The 79-year-old Grandmother Lee Yong Suk's cooking."

706
00:26:22,717 --> 00:26:27,086
(Dong Hyun is fighting against himself.)

707
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:29,856
(Dozing off)

708
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:32,757
(Surprised)

709
00:26:34,257 --> 00:26:36,026
(As long as the distance, )

710
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,696
(his consciousness gets far away.)

711
00:26:38,697 --> 00:26:41,096
(Surprised again)

712
00:26:43,737 --> 00:26:45,076
It's really far.

713
00:26:45,406 --> 00:26:48,106
Did we use our nap card on Dong Hyun?

714
00:26:48,906 --> 00:26:50,546
(30-minute nap card)

715
00:26:50,547 --> 00:26:52,787
(You can put the other team to sleep whenever you want.)

716
00:26:53,017 --> 00:26:55,315
(Giggling)

717
00:26:55,316 --> 00:26:57,686
(Team Guys continues their way to Yangpyeong.)

718
00:26:57,687 --> 00:26:59,116
Why isn't the alarm going off?

719
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:00,356
I know.

720
00:27:00,357 --> 00:27:03,626
It's been four hours.

721
00:27:03,987 --> 00:27:06,797
Here's what we can assume.

722
00:27:07,427 --> 00:27:09,566
- They must have failed. - Right.

723
00:27:09,767 --> 00:27:10,767
Yes.

724
00:27:10,768 --> 00:27:12,267
That's reasonable, isn't it?

725
00:27:13,197 --> 00:27:15,166
There are so many good restaurants.

726
00:27:16,606 --> 00:27:18,636
- Everything looks good. - Are you hungry?

727
00:27:19,406 --> 00:27:21,706
- Yes. - I'm a little hungry.

728
00:27:21,707 --> 00:27:23,406
I'm very hungry.

729
00:27:24,007 --> 00:27:25,276
- I agree. - I got sluggish after eating,

730
00:27:25,277 --> 00:27:26,716
so I was very sleepy.

731
00:27:26,717 --> 00:27:28,437
Now that I'm hungry, I'm not sleepy at all.

732
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:30,646
I'm starving. On our way here,

733
00:27:31,217 --> 00:27:34,456
I saw signs for small octopus and lotus leaf rice.

734
00:27:34,457 --> 00:27:35,826
Lotus leaf rice sounds delicious.

735
00:27:36,257 --> 00:27:38,256
- Where is it? - Charcoal spicy stir-fried chicken.

736
00:27:38,257 --> 00:27:39,657
It's authentic at places like this.

737
00:27:40,126 --> 00:27:42,366
We're going to the spot for countryside meal.

738
00:27:42,626 --> 00:27:44,665
The content is eating,

739
00:27:44,666 --> 00:27:46,095
so I don't think...

740
00:27:46,096 --> 00:27:47,365
we'll get food for answering the quiz.

741
00:27:47,366 --> 00:27:48,466
Steamed buns.

742
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,537
(He can't hear Tae Hyun.)

743
00:27:50,207 --> 00:27:51,876
The white thing with steam rising.

744
00:27:52,937 --> 00:27:55,106
Now that we crossed the bridge,

745
00:27:55,947 --> 00:27:57,576
we got to a village.

746
00:27:58,217 --> 00:27:59,316
We're almost there.

747
00:28:00,947 --> 00:28:05,017
She makes YouTube videos so deep in the mountain.

748
00:28:06,356 --> 00:28:10,656
It must be someone far from the real world.

749
00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:13,426
The snow hasn't melted yet.

750
00:28:13,427 --> 00:28:15,395
I bet the snow doesn't melt throughout winter.

751
00:28:15,396 --> 00:28:17,165
(They pass the alley covered with snow...)

752
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:18,895
(that doesn't match the real world.)

753
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:21,066
Anyone would taste good when you eat here.

754
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,536
I hope she has braised tofu.

This is amazing.

760
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:37,567
Aren't those dried radish greens?

761
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,257

763
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:46,996
It's a cast iron pot. That's my favourite.

764
00:28:47,596 --> 00:28:49,366
Rice made in a cast iron pot is my favourite.

765

- but I've been thinking. - Yes?

803
00:30:14,846 --> 00:30:16,645
There's a show...

804

- Really? - Really?

853
00:32:08,197 --> 00:32:09,743
- You look young for your age. - I know.

854
00:32:09,767 --> 00:32:11,496

You have to eat.

On an eating show, all you have to do is eat.

869
00:32:41,826 --> 00:32:43,296
- You just need to eat. - I'm confident.

870
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:44,377
(I'm confident about that.)

871
00:32:45,096 --> 00:32:46,595
You'll do an eating show together.

878
00:32:58,416 --> 00:32:59,746
- Goodness. - Oh, no.

879
00:32:59,747 --> 00:33:01,816
In our way here,

880
00:33:02,086 --> 00:33:04,046
they were really looking forward to it.

881
00:33:04,047 --> 00:33:06,487
We didn't think only one would be picked.

882
00:33:06,787 --> 00:33:11,287
I'll be honest. We can only pick one.

883
00:33:12,126 --> 00:33:15,095
Ever since I was young,

884
00:33:15,096 --> 00:33:16,296

00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:20,665

888

I love it. I'd love to see you eat.

889
00:33:25,277 --> 00:33:26,606
I'll try my best...

890
00:33:26,907 --> 00:33:28,347

00:34:08,686 --> 00:34:09,947
This is bad.

906
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:13,717
Dong Hyun's been wanting to have this today.

907
00:34:14,856 --> 00:34:16,625
(Losing his mind)

908
00:34:16,626 --> 00:34:17,855
Dong Hyun, what do I do?

909
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,456
Leave some for me, okay?

910
00:34:19,527 --> 00:34:20,656
Gosh, the kimchi is incredible.

911
00:34:20,657 --> 00:34:22,697
(They're now here taking the scene in.)

912
00:34:23,097 --> 00:34:24,466
Even gochujang marinated pork belly?

913
00:34:24,467 --> 00:34:25,935
(Today's hearty meal)

914
00:34:25,936 --> 00:34:27,697
It's gochujang marinated pork belly.

915
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,066
This is crazy.

916
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,467
Please make it look good.

917
00:34:32,907 --> 00:34:34,036
That looks nice.

918
00:34:34,077 --> 00:34:36,546
- Please enjoy. - Will they be sitting next to us?

919
00:34:36,547 --> 00:34:37,876
- It's all right. - Please enjoy.

920
00:34:38,047 --> 00:34:40,745
We're your subscribers.

921
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:41,846
(Even the subscribers have taken their seats.)

922
00:34:41,847 --> 00:34:43,487
(The eating show begins!)

923
00:34:43,786 --> 00:34:47,717
Subscribers, have you been well?

924
00:34:48,157 --> 00:34:52,196
Today, we were visited by a show...

925
00:34:52,197 --> 00:34:54,257
who will also film us eating.

926
00:34:54,996 --> 00:34:55,996
(Cha Tae Hyun, today's main guest)

927
00:34:55,997 --> 00:34:58,765
That's why we're joined...

928
00:34:58,766 --> 00:35:00,867
by these three young men.

929
00:35:01,166 --> 00:35:04,165
Today, we'll be eating the food...

930
00:35:04,166 --> 00:35:06,076
with actor Cha Tae Hyun.

931
00:35:06,077 --> 00:35:07,906
What a pleasure.

932
00:35:07,907 --> 00:35:09,906
I'll do my best to enjoy the food,

933
00:35:09,907 --> 00:35:11,677
subscribers.

934
00:35:12,146 --> 00:35:14,375
Can you introduce today's menu?

935
00:35:14,376 --> 00:35:16,046
We have doenjang soup with outer greens.

936
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:18,756
- Goodness, outer greens? - Yes, and this...

937
00:35:18,757 --> 00:35:20,285
- Dried radish greens. - Dried radish greens...

938
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:21,826
- Braised half-dried pollack. - and braised half-dried pollack.

939
00:35:21,827 --> 00:35:23,685
This is enoki mushroom jeon.

940
00:35:23,686 --> 00:35:24,725
- Enoki mushroom jeon? - Yes.

941
00:35:24,726 --> 00:35:26,396
This is gochujang marinated pork belly.

942
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,495
A couple of days ago,

943
00:35:29,496 --> 00:35:30,866
I made water kimchi with mini napa cabbage.

944
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:31,867
This is the kimchi you already had.

945
00:35:31,867 --> 00:35:32,867
Mustard greens kimchi...

946
00:35:32,868 --> 00:35:34,936
- and napa cabbage kimchi. - I see.

947
00:35:35,507 --> 00:35:37,105
I'll enjoy the food, then.

948
00:35:37,106 --> 00:35:38,336
Sir, please go ahead.

949
00:35:38,777 --> 00:35:40,407
- Thank you for cooking. - Right.

950
00:35:46,016 --> 00:35:47,016
It's delicious.

951
00:35:47,017 --> 00:35:48,347
(In the sweetest way)

952
00:35:48,487 --> 00:35:50,085
Tae Hyun, please try the soup.

953
00:35:50,086 --> 00:35:52,387
Got it. I'll try the soup.

954
00:35:52,916 --> 00:35:55,057
Beef and outer greens.

955
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,267
Doenjang soup with outer greens.

956
00:36:00,956 --> 00:36:03,097
- Describe the flavours. - How is it?

957
00:36:03,597 --> 00:36:04,725
Tell us what it's like.

958
00:36:04,726 --> 00:36:06,367
Responding to the food...

959
00:36:06,766 --> 00:36:08,606
isn't the priority. Gosh, this is good.

960
00:36:10,166 --> 00:36:12,375
It's just soup with some cabbage.

961
00:36:12,376 --> 00:36:13,476
And doenjang.

962
00:36:13,876 --> 00:36:16,676
This isn't like your usual home-cooked meals,

963
00:36:16,677 --> 00:36:18,516
and I mean that in a good way.

964
00:36:18,617 --> 00:36:20,245
That's how good it is.

965
00:36:20,246 --> 00:36:22,216
I'm shocked by the quality of the food.

966
00:36:22,217 --> 00:36:23,285
Thank you.

967
00:36:23,286 --> 00:36:24,646
(Gulping)

968
00:36:25,786 --> 00:36:27,616
I'll speak in just a minute.

969
00:36:27,617 --> 00:36:29,726
(A big mouthful)

970
00:36:31,586 --> 00:36:33,496
(Yummy)

971
00:36:33,527 --> 00:36:35,666
(It's torture.)

972
00:36:35,766 --> 00:36:37,666
The outer greens are to die for.

973
00:36:38,126 --> 00:36:39,866
How can this not be good?

974
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:43,266
(Next up is the red grilled pork belly.)

975
00:36:46,237 --> 00:36:48,276
- I'll try this. - Can you have that...

976
00:36:48,277 --> 00:36:51,077
- with the lettuce all at once? - Yes, with the lettuce.

977
00:36:51,447 --> 00:36:52,447
Got it.

978
00:36:52,677 --> 00:36:55,847
(A big mouthful of pork belly)

979
00:36:56,347 --> 00:37:00,816
(Lucky you...)

980
00:37:00,987 --> 00:37:02,356
It's not spicy at all,

981
00:37:03,057 --> 00:37:04,455
and the seasoning is perfect.

982
00:37:04,456 --> 00:37:05,496
Is that so?

983
00:37:06,827 --> 00:37:08,326
(Waiting like a puppy!)

984
00:37:08,327 --> 00:37:09,797
Anyway, this...

985
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:12,436
Why does it seem like food...

986
00:37:12,536 --> 00:37:14,967
that is sold at a top-notch restaurant?

987
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:17,506
Mr. Cha, you seem to be gushing...

988
00:37:17,507 --> 00:37:19,077
- a bit too much. - No, I mean it.

989
00:37:20,436 --> 00:37:21,806
Did you make your own kimchi?

990
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:23,676
Of course. Even the mustard greens kimchi...

991
00:37:23,677 --> 00:37:26,375
was made with what we grew here.

992
00:37:26,376 --> 00:37:27,976
This is mini napa cabbage water kimchi.

993
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,387
That...

994
00:37:29,686 --> 00:37:31,285
will be great to have with boiled pork.

995
00:37:31,286 --> 00:37:32,355
(A true foodie)

996
00:37:32,356 --> 00:37:33,955
So that's how you eat it. With meat.

997
00:37:33,956 --> 00:37:34,987
Right.

998
00:37:35,527 --> 00:37:36,625
It's like a grandma's home-cooked meal.

999
00:37:36,626 --> 00:37:38,625
(Tae Hyun has the pork belly with the water kimchi.)

1000
00:37:38,626 --> 00:37:40,356
- It's like auntie omakase. - Exactly.

1001
00:37:40,496 --> 00:37:41,656
Gosh, the kimchi.

1002
00:37:41,657 --> 00:37:43,466
- Is it good? - Isn't the kimchi good?

1003
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:45,096
(The kimchi is incredible.)

1004
00:37:45,097 --> 00:37:46,665
Even I think the kimchi is delicious...

1005
00:37:46,666 --> 00:37:48,536
even though I made it myself.

1006
00:37:50,566 --> 00:37:51,637
I'm starving.

1007
00:37:52,936 --> 00:37:54,475
This is unbelievable.

1008
00:37:54,476 --> 00:37:55,476
(He'll probably only get to eat if he gets the question right.)

1009
00:37:55,477 --> 00:37:56,807
This...

1010
00:37:57,146 --> 00:37:59,277
- This is insane. - The quiz...

1011
00:37:59,447 --> 00:38:02,216
- They must get it right. - Give them an easy question.

1012
00:38:02,217 --> 00:38:03,245
- Please! - Please!

1013
00:38:03,246 --> 00:38:05,487
- An easy one. - Why don't we guess with them?

1014
00:38:05,956 --> 00:38:07,256
- That'd be nice. - Let us...

1015
00:38:07,257 --> 00:38:09,625
- answer it too. - That'd be great.

1016
00:38:09,626 --> 00:38:12,927
(That's what we're talking about.)

1017
00:38:14,657 --> 00:38:15,866
(Meanwhile, small eater Tae Hyun emptied his bowl.)

1018
00:38:15,867 --> 00:38:17,165
Gosh, you emptied your bowl.

1019
00:38:17,166 --> 00:38:18,696
That I did.

1020
00:38:18,697 --> 00:38:21,065
- My gosh. - He ate quite a lot today.

1021
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:23,335
- He usually doesn't eat much. - He never empties his bowl.

1022
00:38:23,336 --> 00:38:25,065
He ate more than usual.

1023
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:26,436
The number one dish of the day.

1024
00:38:26,507 --> 00:38:28,335
What did you call this?

1025
00:38:28,336 --> 00:38:30,975
- Mini napa cabbage water kimchi. - Mini napa cabbage water kimchi.

1026
00:38:30,976 --> 00:38:32,952
(The best dish of the day: Mini napa cabbage water kimchi)

1027
00:38:32,976 --> 00:38:34,847
I should start guessing the question.

1028
00:38:35,686 --> 00:38:38,186
Watching others eat is torture.

1029
00:38:39,217 --> 00:38:42,455
Thanks to our subscribers,

1030
00:38:42,456 --> 00:38:44,585
we were able to enjoy another tasty meal.

1031
00:38:44,586 --> 00:38:48,125
On top of that, I was able to have my meal...

1032
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:50,066
with Cha Tae Hyun whom I love beside me.

1033
00:38:52,197 --> 00:38:55,096

00:38:56,566 --> 00:38:58,206
Please give them all your support.

1036
00:38:58,307 --> 00:38:59,806
- Right. - Always stay healthy.

1037
00:38:59,807 --> 00:39:01,636
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1038
00:39:01,637 --> 00:39:02,776
See you next time.

1039
00:39:02,777 --> 00:39:04,277

1041
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:08,986
I hope you edit it well.

1042
00:39:08,987 --> 00:39:10,217
- This... - No way.

1043
00:39:10,516 --> 00:39:11,717
You just eat the meal.

1044

00:39:17,487 --> 00:39:21,657
(Getting some shut eye due to the nap card)

1046
00:39:24,027 --> 00:39:25,436
All right.

1047
00:39:26,166 --> 00:39:27,395
Let's check where they are.

1048
00:39:27,396 --> 00:39:28,565
We should use the tracking card.

1049
00:39:28,566 --> 00:39:29,566
- You'll see where they are? - Yes.

1050
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:30,705
Then we'll decide where to go.

1051
00:39:30,706 --> 00:39:32,376
- It's here. - Really?

1052
00:39:33,177 --> 00:39:35,507
They're not in Seongnam. Wait. Where is this?

1053
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,146
Where are they? Let me see.

1054
00:39:38,307 --> 00:39:40,516
- Mount Sori? - Let's see.

1055
00:39:42,086 --> 00:39:43,316
Where are they headed?

1056
00:39:44,016 --> 00:39:45,416
They're on their way to Yangpyeong.

1057
00:39:47,057 --> 00:39:48,156
Haven't they already been to Yangpyeong?

1058
00:39:48,157 --> 00:39:50,387
It makes no sense. Why would they...

1059
00:39:50,527 --> 00:39:52,157
Are they trying to only get these three?

1060
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:53,797
That could be it.

1061
00:39:53,996 --> 00:39:55,725
- Should we go to Seongnam A? - Yes, that's where we must go.

1062
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:56,926
Let's go to Seongnam A anyway.

1063
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:59,065
After we go to Seongnam A,

1064
00:39:59,066 --> 00:40:00,665
with some wishful thinking,

1065
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:02,105
- we'll go to Yangpyeong. - Sounds good.

1066
00:40:02,106 --> 00:40:04,736
We'll get the question right at Seongnam A...

1067
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:06,336
and complete the bingo in Yangpyeong.

1068
00:40:06,407 --> 00:40:07,535
- Okay. - Good.

1069
00:40:07,536 --> 00:40:10,277
We should hope they get the question wrong.

1070
00:40:12,217 --> 00:40:14,145
They ditched this place...

1071
00:40:14,146 --> 00:40:15,586
and took a gamble.

1072
00:40:17,357 --> 00:40:18,587
We need to get it right here.

1073
00:40:20,532 --> 00:40:22,372
(Team Handsome arrive at a furniture showroom.)

1074
00:40:22,397 --> 00:40:24,317
I didn't know so many things would be this nice.

1076
00:40:31,536 --> 00:40:32,766
- Hello. - Hello.

- Hello. - Hello.

Hello. It's a pleasure to meet you.

- Hi, it's a pleasure. - Hello.

- You have a firm grip. - What?

1082
00:40:42,246 --> 00:40:43,416
That was quite the squeeze.

1083
00:40:43,417 --> 00:40:44,417
(The lady with the firm grip is...)

1084
00:40:44,418 --> 00:40:46,538
- That was firm. - They say you're a content creator.

1085
00:40:46,846 --> 00:40:47,846
Can you please introduce yourself?

1086
00:40:47,847 --> 00:40:51,356
I'm Lee Ji Young who runs the channel...

1087
00:40:51,357 --> 00:40:53,186
named "Jungriking." It's nice to meet you.

1088
00:40:53,187 --> 00:40:54,956
- Ms. Lee a.k.a "Jungriking" - Right.

1089
00:40:54,957 --> 00:40:56,197
(Content creator: Lee Ji Young)

1090
00:40:56,357 --> 00:40:58,765
(A content creator...)

1091
00:40:58,766 --> 00:41:01,166
(who helps you find a new life by tidying your house)

1092
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,896
It was made to make your life easier.

1093
00:41:02,897 --> 00:41:05,506
You can use file holders...

1094
00:41:05,507 --> 00:41:07,406
to store your frying pans.

1095
00:41:07,937 --> 00:41:09,475
(She was recognized for her content that promoted efficiency.)

1096
00:41:09,476 --> 00:41:10,877
(Videos over 2 million hits)

1097
00:41:10,937 --> 00:41:14,707
(She was on "The House Detox" as an expert.)

1098
00:41:15,346 --> 00:41:18,217
(She tidies spaces with her magical touch...)

1099
00:41:19,446 --> 00:41:21,817
(and touches the hearts of her clients.)

1100
00:41:21,987 --> 00:41:24,816
You're the expert on staying neat and tidy.

1101
00:41:24,817 --> 00:41:27,225
Goodness. Well, I'm trying my best.

1102
00:41:27,226 --> 00:41:28,486
What can we try today?

1103
00:41:28,487 --> 00:41:31,896
Today, we'll start by arranging...

1104
00:41:31,897 --> 00:41:33,325
- the furniture. - Arranging furniture.

1105
00:41:33,326 --> 00:41:35,896
I came up with a rule that one can follow...

1106
00:41:35,897 --> 00:41:38,196
depending on their personality and situation.

1107
00:41:38,467 --> 00:41:39,506
So it differs for people.

1108
00:41:39,507 --> 00:41:41,066
I'll introduce you to how you can...

1109
00:41:41,067 --> 00:41:42,675
arrange furniture according to your MBTI personality.

1110
00:41:42,676 --> 00:41:45,006
- Our MBTI personalities? - That's new.

1111
00:41:45,007 --> 00:41:47,207
That's what I'm going to introduce you to.

1112
00:41:47,576 --> 00:41:49,316
What's your MBTI personality?

1113
00:41:49,317 --> 00:41:50,745
I did the test on a show, and it said I was an ENTP.

1114
00:41:50,746 --> 00:41:52,146
- An ENTP. - Yes.

1115
00:41:52,147 --> 00:41:53,816
- I'm an INFP. - An INFP.

1116
00:41:53,817 --> 00:41:55,886
Hey, ours is similar. I'm an INFJ...

1117
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:57,416
but also an INFP.

1118
00:41:57,417 --> 00:42:00,325
We have a variety of personalities here.

1119
00:42:00,326 --> 00:42:02,155
Today, we'll arrange the furniture...

1120
00:42:02,156 --> 00:42:04,026
based on someone with an ENFP personality.

1121
00:42:04,027 --> 00:42:05,566
- Could you show us? - Sure.

1122
00:42:05,567 --> 00:42:08,396
- Over there, you see books. - Right.

1123
00:42:08,397 --> 00:42:10,096
Go ahead and place them in the bookshelf.

1124
00:42:11,067 --> 00:42:14,206
This is how I arrange my books at home.

1125
00:42:14,207 --> 00:42:15,366
Well...

1126
00:42:15,437 --> 00:42:16,905
Gosh. This might not be the best way,

1127
00:42:16,906 --> 00:42:18,206
but I like to push them...

1128
00:42:18,207 --> 00:42:19,475
- as further in as possible. - Okay.

1129
00:42:19,476 --> 00:42:21,106
I try to line up their heights.

1130
00:42:21,107 --> 00:42:22,745
- If some are sticking out, - Yes.

1131
00:42:22,746 --> 00:42:23,916
I take them...

1132
00:42:23,917 --> 00:42:26,186
and put them at the back.

1133
00:42:26,187 --> 00:42:27,845
(Yi Kyung pushes the books back and in the order of their sizes.)

1134
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:30,257
Don't forget about the desk up here.

1135
00:42:32,627 --> 00:42:35,087
(Putting on)

1136
00:42:36,056 --> 00:42:37,257
(Taking)

1137
00:42:38,696 --> 00:42:40,096
Is there a reason you took it away?

1138
00:42:40,127 --> 00:42:42,536
Yes. I don't like stuff like it on my desk.

1139
00:42:43,167 --> 00:42:44,167
There are too many pens.

1140
00:42:44,168 --> 00:42:46,666
- I don't put many pens on the desk. - I see.

1141
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:48,566
There is a table mat.

1142
00:42:48,567 --> 00:42:49,882
(Seung Ho recommends using the table mat.)

1143
00:42:49,906 --> 00:42:50,975
I don't use this,

1144
00:42:50,976 --> 00:42:52,523
- but I'll use it since we have it. - You don't use it?

1145
00:42:52,547 --> 00:42:54,547
In that case, you don't have to take it out.

1146
00:42:54,806 --> 00:42:56,316
- You don't have to. - Okay. Then...

1147
00:42:56,317 --> 00:42:57,575
I don't have this.

1148
00:42:57,576 --> 00:42:58,716
If there's a clock, I keep checking it.

1149
00:42:58,717 --> 00:42:59,987
The clock's out too? I see.

1150
00:43:00,116 --> 00:43:01,717
I don't need this, either.

1151
00:43:02,317 --> 00:43:04,056
Actually, I put them here.

1152
00:43:04,116 --> 00:43:05,217
I don't need it.

1153
00:43:05,587 --> 00:43:07,526
- You only need one. - That's what I do in real life.

1154
00:43:07,527 --> 00:43:08,655
Good.

1155
00:43:08,656 --> 00:43:10,096
Right. We don't need many pens.

1156
00:43:10,897 --> 00:43:12,896
- I only place what I need. - Like this.

1157
00:43:12,897 --> 00:43:13,995
Just the important ones.

1158
00:43:13,996 --> 00:43:16,397
I put a script, blank note,

1159
00:43:16,496 --> 00:43:18,536
- and a pen. Yes. - Okay.

1160
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,535
- Where do you put it? - Where do you want to place it?

1161
00:43:20,536 --> 00:43:23,837
(Now, they'll place the furniture.)

1162
00:43:25,437 --> 00:43:27,707
I want nothing behind me.

1163
00:43:27,846 --> 00:43:29,115
What about the chair, then?

1164
00:43:29,116 --> 00:43:31,147
(He sticks the chair on the other wall.)

1165
00:43:31,746 --> 00:43:32,846
Like this.

1166
00:43:32,987 --> 00:43:34,663
There's nothing behind your back, and in front of you is open.

1167
00:43:34,687 --> 00:43:35,885
I like to sit in the last row...

1168
00:43:35,886 --> 00:43:37,086
- when I go to a movie. - The last row.

1169
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,686
I hate having people behind me.

1170
00:43:38,687 --> 00:43:41,825
Okay. You place the furniture for a reason.

1171
00:43:41,826 --> 00:43:45,425
In fact, Type E is an extrovert.

1172
00:43:45,426 --> 00:43:46,796
They like to get energy...

1173
00:43:46,797 --> 00:43:48,195
- from other people. - Yes.

1174
00:43:48,196 --> 00:43:50,076
Arranging the room like a CEO is good for them.

1175
00:43:50,467 --> 00:43:53,406
They like to see what's out there.

1176
00:43:53,467 --> 00:43:56,706
Also, since Type I is an introvert,

1177
00:43:56,707 --> 00:43:59,606
it's better to arrange the furniture next to a door.

1178
00:43:59,607 --> 00:44:01,075
(She recommends placing the desk next to the door toward the wall.)

1179
00:44:01,076 --> 00:44:02,615
I might like to place the desk...

1180
00:44:02,616 --> 00:44:04,575
- up against the window... - Okay.

1181
00:44:04,576 --> 00:44:06,686
And enjoy the view outside the window.

1182
00:44:06,687 --> 00:44:09,687
Of the MBTI personalities, it's good for the Type S.

1183
00:44:09,757 --> 00:44:11,256
They're observant.

1184
00:44:11,257 --> 00:44:13,986
They like to face reality.

1185
00:44:13,987 --> 00:44:16,896
- They might need more creativity. - Right.

1186
00:44:16,897 --> 00:44:18,595
For such people,

1187
00:44:18,596 --> 00:44:21,897
they can look outside and expand their thoughts.

1188
00:44:22,027 --> 00:44:25,766
So, we place the desk so that they can see outside the window.

1189
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:28,006
On the other hand, Type N...

1190
00:44:28,007 --> 00:44:30,176
can become distracted.

1191
00:44:30,207 --> 00:44:31,636
For example,

1192
00:44:31,707 --> 00:44:34,046
they were going to study, but there were nail clippers,

1193
00:44:34,047 --> 00:44:35,445
so they clipped their nails first.

1194
00:44:35,446 --> 00:44:37,445
- That would be me. - I do it too.

1195
00:44:37,446 --> 00:44:38,716
- Me too. - Before studying,

1196
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,115
they need to organize their pencil case and clean up.

1197
00:44:41,116 --> 00:44:42,885
For those people,

1198
00:44:42,886 --> 00:44:44,816
they need to get rid of distractions.

1199
00:44:44,817 --> 00:44:46,925
- This is the result of it. - Right.

1200
00:44:46,926 --> 00:44:48,555
I can't have other things when I read a script.

1201
00:44:48,556 --> 00:44:50,672
So even when I go to a cafe, I only take these with me.

1202
00:44:50,696 --> 00:44:51,797
Right.

1203
00:44:51,826 --> 00:44:54,695
For Type N, who is intuitive,

1204
00:44:54,696 --> 00:44:58,136
we recommend a bookshelf with a door.

1205
00:44:58,567 --> 00:45:00,606
It's important to hide them from their sight.

1206
00:45:00,607 --> 00:45:03,707
If they see many things, they can't focus.

1207
00:45:03,777 --> 00:45:05,707
That can be a case too.

1208
00:45:06,507 --> 00:45:08,846
If I were to arrange the room in an honest way,

1209
00:45:09,016 --> 00:45:10,016
I'll place...

1210
00:45:10,047 --> 00:45:11,776
- the desk up against the window. - Go ahead.

1211
00:45:11,777 --> 00:45:12,885
(Kyung Ho arranges the study too.)

1212
00:45:12,886 --> 00:45:15,655
(He moves the desk toward the window first.)

1213
00:45:15,656 --> 00:45:17,785
if you want it to be messy,

1214
00:45:17,786 --> 00:45:19,026
I'll knock it over.

1215
00:45:19,027 --> 00:45:20,456
Rather than being messy,

1216
00:45:20,457 --> 00:45:22,186
I want what I need...

1217
00:45:22,187 --> 00:45:23,947
- where I can reach it. - You need it there.

1218
00:45:24,326 --> 00:45:25,527
They'll be here.

1219
00:45:25,866 --> 00:45:29,066
A thing like this can lighten up my mood.

1220
00:45:29,067 --> 00:45:30,195
(He has to set up a sentimental item to refresh his mood.)

1221
00:45:30,196 --> 00:45:31,336
- Here. - Including that...

1222
00:45:31,337 --> 00:45:34,036
If a lamp is next to it, it'll feel cosy.

1223
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:35,405
I'll place it here.

1224
00:45:35,406 --> 00:45:36,636
Some put these there.

1225
00:45:37,737 --> 00:45:38,976
Some put these there.

1226
00:45:39,306 --> 00:45:41,476
- Some do this. - No, I don't do that.

1227
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,015
- I don't. - There are people who do this.

1228
00:45:43,016 --> 00:45:44,376
I don't put the books there, but if they're the books...

1229
00:45:44,377 --> 00:45:45,885
- I've been reading, - Yes.

1230
00:45:45,886 --> 00:45:48,147
- I'll put a couple of them here. - You put them there.

1231
00:45:48,386 --> 00:45:49,416
If they are the books I'll read in the future,

1232
00:45:49,417 --> 00:45:50,457
The books to read.

1233
00:45:50,917 --> 00:45:52,356
- then... - I'll help you.

1234
00:45:52,357 --> 00:45:53,655
I might put them down here.

1235
00:45:53,656 --> 00:45:55,416
(The books to read are placed on the floor.)

1236
00:45:55,656 --> 00:45:56,796
It's a bit...

1237
00:45:56,797 --> 00:45:58,756
(When they move the bookshelf toward the wall...)

1238
00:45:58,757 --> 00:46:00,166
This feels nice too.

1239
00:46:00,167 --> 00:46:01,496
(This feels nice too.)

1240
00:46:02,127 --> 00:46:05,066
(Type F Kyung Ho's study with sentimental vibes are ready.)

1241
00:46:05,067 --> 00:46:06,067
- Ma'am. - Yes.

1242
00:46:06,068 --> 00:46:08,635
What kind of person is he, then?

1243
00:46:08,636 --> 00:46:09,876
Compared to the last room,

1244
00:46:09,877 --> 00:46:12,106
it looks much prettier.

1245
00:46:12,107 --> 00:46:13,175
What do you mean?

1246
00:46:13,176 --> 00:46:15,206
- Look. You two are very different. - Okay.

1247
00:46:15,207 --> 00:46:17,945
Room decor-wise, it's much prettier now.

1248
00:46:17,946 --> 00:46:20,445
- It's so distracting. - No. It's pretty.

1249
00:46:20,446 --> 00:46:22,857
Also, it's easy to use.

1250
00:46:22,917 --> 00:46:24,515
When he needs to cut something while reading a script,

1251
00:46:24,516 --> 00:46:26,126
it's all prepared down there.

1252
00:46:26,127 --> 00:46:29,155
There are glue and a pencil sharpener too.

1253
00:46:29,156 --> 00:46:30,695
- It's convenient. - When you look at the items...

1254
00:46:30,696 --> 00:46:32,226
- and the pile of books, - Yes.

1255
00:46:32,397 --> 00:46:34,167
He just likes to show off.

1256
00:46:35,366 --> 00:46:38,437
We need to show off a little in our life.

1257
00:46:38,467 --> 00:46:40,765
The books he read and the books to read.

1258
00:46:40,766 --> 00:46:43,006
- The books he's reading. - Usually, they're not called books.

1259
00:46:43,007 --> 00:46:44,576
- They are a footrest. - No.

1260
00:46:44,976 --> 00:46:47,006
Usually, I charge my phone on it.

1261
00:46:47,007 --> 00:46:50,377
I plug it in and place it here.

1262
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,216
That looks real, though.

1263
00:46:52,217 --> 00:46:53,916
(The best arrangement is the one that suits you.)

1264
00:46:53,917 --> 00:46:56,515
- Thank you, ma'am. - Thank you.

1265
00:46:56,516 --> 00:46:57,655
- Thank you so much. - Yes.

1266
00:46:57,656 --> 00:46:59,257
(Time for Quiz)

1267
00:46:59,326 --> 00:47:01,586
Now, it's not over until it's over.

1268
00:47:01,587 --> 00:47:03,696
It's getting dark outside.

1269
00:47:03,897 --> 00:47:05,325
- We have to get this one. - Yes. Let's get it.

1270
00:47:05,326 --> 00:47:07,206
- It's the last one. - We have to get it right.

1271
00:47:07,397 --> 00:47:09,026
- I'll show you a photo. - What?

1272
00:47:09,027 --> 00:47:10,036
(I'll show you a photo.)

1273
00:47:13,207 --> 00:47:17,306
Okay. It's a photo of the corridor of S Apartment...

1274
00:47:17,337 --> 00:47:20,346
in Yeouido, Seoul that was completed in 1971.

1275
00:47:20,377 --> 00:47:21,845
- S Apartment? - Yes.

1276
00:47:21,846 --> 00:47:23,317
It's in Yeouido. It's well-known.

1277
00:47:23,777 --> 00:47:26,746
Since the apartment structure didn't include a yard,

1278
00:47:26,946 --> 00:47:31,616
they made a space for these on one side of the corridor.

1279
00:47:31,817 --> 00:47:33,357
What is "these?"

1280
00:47:34,127 --> 00:47:35,326
Aren't they flower pots?

1281
00:47:35,527 --> 00:47:36,767
Isn't it jangdokdae for crocks?

1282
00:47:37,656 --> 00:47:39,666
The crocks have been part...

1283
00:47:39,667 --> 00:47:41,627
- of our lives. - You're right.

1284
00:47:41,696 --> 00:47:44,167
We always had them in the backyard.

1285
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:46,707
When they moved into an apartment, there was no yard,

1286
00:47:47,036 --> 00:47:48,336
but they needed to keep the crocks...

1287
00:47:48,337 --> 00:47:49,606
- outside. - It's...

1288
00:47:49,607 --> 00:47:50,805
This is what I think.

1289
00:47:50,806 --> 00:47:52,206
What used to be in the yard...

1290
00:47:52,207 --> 00:47:53,606
- had to be here. - Yes.

1291
00:47:53,607 --> 00:47:54,877
That's the key to the question.

1292
00:47:55,446 --> 00:48:00,446
It's a place to put them in replacement of a yard in 1971.

1293
00:48:00,616 --> 00:48:02,385
When I look at the space,

1294
00:48:02,386 --> 00:48:04,156
it's good for flower pots like he said.

1295
00:48:04,187 --> 00:48:05,456
Crocks make sense too.

1296
00:48:05,457 --> 00:48:06,963
Is it okay for them to be exposed to sunlight?

1297
00:48:06,987 --> 00:48:09,155
We didn't just put them in the backyard.

1298
00:48:09,156 --> 00:48:12,396
When you look at the old, detached houses,

1299
00:48:12,397 --> 00:48:15,495
they place it up there where you have to climb the stairs.

1300
00:48:15,496 --> 00:48:17,236
I saw them put the crocks on the roof.

1301
00:48:17,237 --> 00:48:18,595
I think it's jangdokdae for crocks.

1302
00:48:18,596 --> 00:48:20,636
Yes. The flower pots are so...

1303
00:48:20,707 --> 00:48:22,876
- It's too simple. - On top of that,

1304
00:48:22,877 --> 00:48:24,675
they had to put what was in the yard...

1305
00:48:24,676 --> 00:48:26,446
- in here in 1971. - That's right.

1306
00:48:26,547 --> 00:48:28,976
If it's something essential, it must be the crocks.

1307
00:48:29,417 --> 00:48:31,245
I think we need to get it right...

1308
00:48:31,246 --> 00:48:33,586
- and go to Yangpyeong. - Okay. We don't have time.

1309
00:48:33,587 --> 00:48:35,586
You can say the answer right away.

1310
00:48:35,587 --> 00:48:37,015
I'll trust you guys.

1311
00:48:37,016 --> 00:48:38,487
- I have no idea. - Don't worry.

1312
00:48:38,616 --> 00:48:39,687
The answer is...

1313
00:48:40,187 --> 00:48:41,457
jangdokdae.

1314
00:48:41,987 --> 00:48:43,155
Jangdokdae.

1315
00:48:43,156 --> 00:48:44,325
(They've come up with the answer faster than ever.)

1316
00:48:44,326 --> 00:48:46,425
(Is jangdokdae correct?)

1317
00:48:46,426 --> 00:48:47,925
(Answer: Jangdokdae)

1318
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:49,836
Correct.

1319
00:48:49,837 --> 00:48:51,166
(Team Handsome got it right!)

1320
00:48:51,167 --> 00:48:52,667
I told you.

1321
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:54,206
We did it.

1322
00:48:54,207 --> 00:48:56,047
- We don't have to think further. - It's done.

1323
00:48:56,277 --> 00:48:58,475
- Lifestyle. - Style.

1324
00:48:58,476 --> 00:49:02,376
(Seongnam A: Lifestyle)

1325
00:49:02,377 --> 00:49:04,075
(Seongnam, Yangpyeong, Gapyeong)

1326
00:49:04,076 --> 00:49:05,475
We still have hope.

1327
00:49:05,476 --> 00:49:06,916
- Yes. - We still have hope.

1328
00:49:06,917 --> 00:49:08,146
It's not over until the alarm goes off...

1329
00:49:08,147 --> 00:49:09,467
- for Yangpyeong. - You're right.

1330
00:49:09,587 --> 00:49:11,187
- Now, the last spot. - Show it to me.

1331
00:49:11,886 --> 00:49:12,926
Please.

1332
00:49:13,087 --> 00:49:15,996
- Okay. We can get them to go. - Hot dogs.

1333
00:49:16,426 --> 00:49:18,095
Since we got the hot dogs,

1334
00:49:18,096 --> 00:49:19,726
we can get them to go.

1335
00:49:20,426 --> 00:49:22,496
We'll go to Yangpyeong now.

1336
00:49:22,567 --> 00:49:24,836
Since it's late, let's get going.

1337
00:49:24,837 --> 00:49:26,135
- We have to get hot dogs first. - Yes.

1338
00:49:26,136 --> 00:49:27,905
(Team Guys)

1339
00:49:27,906 --> 00:49:31,306
He has a big vegetable farm back there.

1340
00:49:32,306 --> 00:49:33,676
Gosh. Basically,

1341
00:49:33,777 --> 00:49:34,876
you can get almost all the ingredients...

1342
00:49:34,877 --> 00:49:35,975
- from here. - We can get them all.

1343
00:49:35,976 --> 00:49:37,516
We have them all.

1344
00:49:37,717 --> 00:49:38,916
What do you grow?

1345
00:49:38,917 --> 00:49:40,146
About 25 kinds.

1346
00:49:40,147 --> 00:49:42,086
- About 25 kinds? - Or about 30 kinds.

1347
00:49:42,087 --> 00:49:43,615
I do it all by myself.

1348
00:49:43,616 --> 00:49:44,816
(I do it all by myself.)

1349
00:49:44,817 --> 00:49:47,126
He grows a lot of stuff.

1350
00:49:47,127 --> 00:49:48,726
He's truly amazing.

1351
00:49:48,757 --> 00:49:50,256
(Cuckoo)

1352
00:49:50,257 --> 00:49:51,296
It's over.

1353
00:49:51,297 --> 00:49:52,396
Seongnam A.

1354
00:49:52,397 --> 00:49:54,296
- I knew it. - Right. Seongnam A.

1355
00:49:54,297 --> 00:49:57,695
We're losing right now. It's 3 versus 2.

1356
00:49:57,696 --> 00:49:59,707
They'll try to come here, right?

1357
00:49:59,866 --> 00:50:01,067
We have to get it right.

1358
00:50:01,337 --> 00:50:03,437
- Should we solve the quiz quickly? - Yes.

1359
00:50:03,737 --> 00:50:05,206
Here's the question.

1360
00:50:05,207 --> 00:50:08,745
In 2021, it made headlines when the Korean word...

1361
00:50:08,746 --> 00:50:11,716
"Mukbang" was added to the Oxford English Dictionary.

1362
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,546
Mukbang was added to the English dictionary?

1363
00:50:14,547 --> 00:50:18,015
Recently, the dictionary was updated with some Korean words.

1364
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:22,695
Of the following, which word is not in the dictionary?

1365
00:50:22,696 --> 00:50:24,596
- It's a multiple-choice question. - Good.

1366
00:50:25,226 --> 00:50:26,866
Number One, "hyung."

1367
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:28,996
Number Two, "noraebang."

1368
00:50:29,127 --> 00:50:31,036
Number Three, "dalgona."

1369
00:50:31,266 --> 00:50:33,337
Number four, "samgyetang."

1370
00:50:34,707 --> 00:50:37,076
- We're choosing what is not in it? - That's right.

1371
00:50:37,406 --> 00:50:39,845
- None of them. - Tae Hyun.

1372
00:50:39,846 --> 00:50:41,706
Samgyetang is in it.

1373
00:50:41,707 --> 00:50:43,316
What was the second one? Noraebang, the Korean karaoke, is in it.

1374
00:50:43,317 --> 00:50:46,015
- Is it? - Isn't samgyetang chicken soup?

1375
00:50:46,016 --> 00:50:47,216
- No. - No.

1376
00:50:47,217 --> 00:50:48,385
Noraebang and samgyetang...

1377
00:50:48,386 --> 00:50:49,586
- are in the dictionary? - It's...

1378
00:50:49,587 --> 00:50:52,055
- Isn't noraebang in it as karaoke? - No.

1379
00:50:52,056 --> 00:50:53,086
I feel like...

1380
00:50:53,087 --> 00:50:55,225
- Was it based on your feelings? - It feels like... Listen.

1381
00:50:55,226 --> 00:50:57,925
Since Korean culture,

1382
00:50:57,926 --> 00:51:00,826
the K-culture, is gaining worldwide popularity,

1383
00:51:00,866 --> 00:51:03,736
noraebang and samgyetang...

1384
00:51:03,737 --> 00:51:04,936
must be in the dictionary.

1385
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:06,765
- Dalgona is in it for "Squid Game?" - Because of "Squid Game."

1386
00:51:06,766 --> 00:51:08,305
It must be in it because of "Squid Game."

1387
00:51:08,306 --> 00:51:10,305
But hyung can be just "brother."

1388
00:51:10,306 --> 00:51:12,075
Right. Hyung is confusing.

1389
00:51:12,076 --> 00:51:13,206
Ma'am, it's hard, isn't it?

1390
00:51:13,207 --> 00:51:14,445
- It's hard. - It's hard.

1391
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,675
I ask you to give them...

1392
00:51:15,676 --> 00:51:16,877
- an easy one. - It's hard.

1393
00:51:18,016 --> 00:51:21,546
I thought noraebang was the answer because it was not food.

1394
00:51:21,547 --> 00:51:23,586
But it might not be true when I heard you.

1395
00:51:23,587 --> 00:51:25,357
What do the sons think?

1396
00:51:25,386 --> 00:51:28,386
- Hyung sounds suspicious. - Hyung sounds suspicious,

1397
00:51:28,587 --> 00:51:30,725
but one thing is for sure. Having more people...

1398
00:51:30,726 --> 00:51:32,156
doesn't mean it's helpful.

1399
00:51:32,556 --> 00:51:33,566
You're right.

1400
00:51:33,567 --> 00:51:35,266
It's more confusing.

1401
00:51:35,397 --> 00:51:37,535
- It's more confusing. - You're right.

1402
00:51:37,536 --> 00:51:39,265
(Each has a different opinion.)

1403
00:51:39,266 --> 00:51:41,067
Gosh. Why do I think it's noraebang?

1404
00:51:41,607 --> 00:51:42,706
- There's... - Gosh.

1405
00:51:42,707 --> 00:51:44,535
- There's karaoke. - Okay.

1406
00:51:44,536 --> 00:51:45,806
(Sang Uk has a hunch.)

1407
00:51:46,607 --> 00:51:49,445
Today, I want to trust Sung Uk's gut feeling.

1408
00:51:49,446 --> 00:51:51,023
But why would hyung be in the dictionary?

1409
00:51:51,047 --> 00:51:52,675
As for hyung,

1410
00:51:52,676 --> 00:51:53,745
Do foreigners say it?

1411
00:51:53,746 --> 00:51:55,226
When I compete in the games overseas,

1412
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,856
they know the word "hyung" a lot.

1413
00:51:57,857 --> 00:51:59,016
Really?

1414
00:51:59,487 --> 00:52:01,555
I'll give my vote to Sang Uk today.

1415
00:52:01,556 --> 00:52:04,056
I want to support Sang Uk's opinion.

1416
00:52:04,457 --> 00:52:07,225
When you go to noraebang in Japan or the US,

1417
00:52:07,226 --> 00:52:08,896
- It says "karaoke." - it says "karaoke."

1418
00:52:08,897 --> 00:52:10,865
I've never seen "noraebang" written on it.

1419
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:12,095
When we think of it,

1420
00:52:12,096 --> 00:52:14,366
the rest of the words all started in Korea.

1421
00:52:14,536 --> 00:52:17,406
But as for noraebang, karaoke might have come first.

1422
00:52:17,576 --> 00:52:19,106
- Even if we get it wrong today, - Go with Sang Uk.

1423
00:52:19,107 --> 00:52:20,675
- we can't blame Sang Uk. - You're right.

1424
00:52:20,676 --> 00:52:22,076
We don't have the right to do so.

1425
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:24,277
We've been not trusting Sang Uk the whole time.

1426
00:52:24,547 --> 00:52:26,163
We might be trusting him with the wrong answer this time.

1427
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:27,486
- It's okay. - Is that okay?

1428
00:52:27,487 --> 00:52:29,486
- Today, it's fine. - Because it's so cold.

1429
00:52:29,487 --> 00:52:30,716
- Yes. Let's go. - Let's go.

1430
00:52:30,717 --> 00:52:32,186
(Sang Uk, let's go!)

1431
00:52:32,187 --> 00:52:33,627
- Okay. - Go ahead, Sang Uk. Say it.

1432
00:52:34,087 --> 00:52:35,447
Number Two must be correct, right?

1433
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,456
- Yes. it's correct. - Let's go.

1434
00:52:37,457 --> 00:52:38,526
- Number Two. Let's go for it. - Dried radish greens...

1435
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,742
and braised half-dried pollack.

1436
00:52:39,766 --> 00:52:40,866
- Our answer is... - Okay.

1437
00:52:41,067 --> 00:52:42,707
- Take a breath. - Number Two, noraebang.

1438
00:52:42,996 --> 00:52:44,036
Please.

1439
00:52:44,136 --> 00:52:47,806
The word that isn't in the Oxford Dictionary.

1440
00:52:48,067 --> 00:52:49,736
(If it's correct, Team Guys win by completing a bingo.)

1441
00:52:49,737 --> 00:52:51,406
(Namyangju, Yangpyeong, Yongin)

1442
00:52:51,707 --> 00:52:53,675
(If it's wrong, Team Handsome has the chance to complete a bingo.)

1443
00:52:53,676 --> 00:52:55,806
(Seongnam A, Yangpyeong, Gapyeong)

1444
00:52:56,377 --> 00:52:57,445
Number Two, noraebang.

1445
00:52:57,446 --> 00:53:03,257
(Will Sang Uk's gut feeling work again this time?)

1446
00:53:04,457 --> 00:53:06,325
(2. Noraebang)

1447
00:53:06,326 --> 00:53:07,357
Incorrect.

1448
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:13,567
(Sang Uk's gut feeling went off in the most critical moment.)

1449
00:53:14,297 --> 00:53:16,536
(Collapsing)

1450
00:53:17,297 --> 00:53:18,736
(In despair)

1451
00:53:18,737 --> 00:53:21,036
- Is it Number One? - Oh, dear.

1452
00:53:21,806 --> 00:53:23,937
Let it not be hyung. Come on.

1453
00:53:24,176 --> 00:53:25,776
- Is it dalgona? - If it's not hyung...

1454
00:53:25,777 --> 00:53:27,417
- The answer is... - Let it not be hyung.

1455
00:53:28,176 --> 00:53:29,576
Number Four, samgyetang.

1456
00:53:29,877 --> 00:53:31,917
- Goodness. - Actually, that's better.

1457
00:53:32,116 --> 00:53:34,046
Tae Hyun, the other team will get it wrong too.

1458
00:53:34,047 --> 00:53:35,885
- It's good. - They're so cruel.

1459
00:53:35,886 --> 00:53:37,457
You have to complain to them.

1460
00:53:37,687 --> 00:53:40,156
It's okay. We had such a good time.

1461
00:53:40,357 --> 00:53:41,527
- Ma'am. - I feel bad.

1462
00:53:41,726 --> 00:53:42,995
- It's okay. - What do I do?

1463
00:53:42,996 --> 00:53:44,356
We can eat in Pocheon.

1464
00:53:44,357 --> 00:53:45,495
There's another mukbang show there.

1465
00:53:45,496 --> 00:53:47,396
- You can't leave without eating. - It's all right.

1466
00:53:47,397 --> 00:53:48,595
- It's okay. - Gosh, ma'am.

1467
00:53:48,596 --> 00:53:49,596
No. It's all right.

1468
00:53:49,597 --> 00:53:51,166
- Good job. - It's okay.

1469
00:53:51,167 --> 00:53:52,736
- It's all right. - Well done.

1470
00:53:52,737 --> 00:53:54,282
(They hurry to Pocheon for the last chance.)

1471
00:53:54,306 --> 00:53:57,136
We have to hurry and get there before 8pm.

1472
00:53:58,136 --> 00:53:59,206
We have to get going.

1473
00:53:59,207 --> 00:54:00,345
Samgyetang is not in the dictionary?

1474
00:54:00,346 --> 00:54:02,007
Gosh. That's unbelievable. Seriously.

1475
00:54:02,507 --> 00:54:03,546
- Everyone will get it wrong. - I'm going to search...

1476
00:54:03,547 --> 00:54:04,676
samgyetang on YouTube.

1477
00:54:05,317 --> 00:54:07,647
- The quiz is so tricky. - Let's look it up.

1478
00:54:07,987 --> 00:54:08,987
That's right.

1479
00:54:09,116 --> 00:54:10,587
(Team Handsome)

1480
00:54:11,217 --> 00:54:13,617
- You've arrived at the destination. - Is this the entrance?

1481
00:54:13,957 --> 00:54:15,257
- I'll go and get them. - Okay.

1482
00:54:16,957 --> 00:54:19,357
I thought we'd have more than enough time.

1483
00:54:20,127 --> 00:54:21,727
In the end, we use all the time we have.

1484
00:54:22,627 --> 00:54:23,696
I'm nervous.

1485
00:54:24,737 --> 00:54:26,506
(Seung Ho quickly comes back with the hot dogs.)

1486
00:54:26,507 --> 00:54:28,337
- Here they are. - Good job.

1487
00:54:28,567 --> 00:54:30,737
According to GPS, we'll barely make it in time.

1488
00:54:31,007 --> 00:54:32,536
Let's enter the place and get going.

1489
00:54:33,346 --> 00:54:35,576
I'll take a bite on behalf of you.

1490
00:54:36,417 --> 00:54:37,446
I'll enjoy it.

1491
00:54:37,676 --> 00:54:39,646
- Did the alarm go off? - No.

1492
00:54:39,647 --> 00:54:40,647
(Slippery)

1493
00:54:40,886 --> 00:54:41,886
(Dropping)

1494
00:54:42,147 --> 00:54:43,156
(Falling)

1495
00:54:43,357 --> 00:54:44,686
(He dropped the hot dog's sausage in the gap.)

1496
00:54:44,687 --> 00:54:45,717
Hold on.

1497
00:54:46,587 --> 00:54:49,386
(Laughing)

1498
00:54:50,457 --> 00:54:52,177
- We can eat it without the sausage. - Hey.

1499
00:54:52,226 --> 00:54:53,226
Hold on.

1500
00:54:53,227 --> 00:54:55,166
That's the hot dog for the victory, isn't it?

1501
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:57,167
I dropped the sausage.

1502
00:54:57,696 --> 00:54:58,836
(Goodness)

1503
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:01,007
- It's meaningless. - I'm so sad.

1504
00:55:02,806 --> 00:55:04,337
Let's try not to feel sad about it.

1505
00:55:05,406 --> 00:55:07,175
(They have to eat it even though they're sad.)

1506
00:55:07,176 --> 00:55:08,575
- I'm so sad. I'll take a bite. - It's all right.

1507
00:55:08,576 --> 00:55:09,917
We are Handsome Guys.

1508
00:55:11,346 --> 00:55:13,187
We'll get going. It'll take an hour...

1509
00:55:13,746 --> 00:55:15,016
and about 15 minutes.

1510
00:55:15,817 --> 00:55:16,886
It's tasty, though.

1511
00:55:18,717 --> 00:55:20,557
- I'm getting a call from Tae Hyun. - Take it.

1512
00:55:20,726 --> 00:55:22,055
- Should I take it? - You should talk cleverly.

1513
00:55:22,056 --> 00:55:24,225
- Say, "Why did you get it wrong?" - "Why did you get it wrong?"

1514
00:55:24,226 --> 00:55:26,186
(Seung Ho, Crazy Gamer, wants to sound them out.)

1515
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,425
It's a long day, Tae Hyun.

1516
00:55:29,426 --> 00:55:30,437
Come on.

1517
00:55:31,567 --> 00:55:33,666
I've been chanting "Beat Kyung Ho..."

1518
00:55:33,667 --> 00:55:35,336
while shooting.

1519
00:55:35,337 --> 00:55:36,337
Yes, Tae Hyun.

1520
00:55:36,338 --> 00:55:39,176
But I just can't beat Kyung Ho.

1521
00:55:40,207 --> 00:55:41,976
Are you by yourself? Why is it so quiet?

1522
00:55:42,107 --> 00:55:43,917
I'm alone. We're not filming right now.

1523
00:55:44,346 --> 00:55:46,075
- Why not? - We talked about...

1524
00:55:46,076 --> 00:55:48,087
what to do for a while, and...

1525
00:55:48,746 --> 00:55:52,556
We're heading to Hyo Joon's place right now.

1526
00:55:52,786 --> 00:55:53,986
I see. To Pocheon?

1527
00:55:53,987 --> 00:55:57,825
That was the only option for us.

1528
00:55:57,826 --> 00:55:59,026
- I see. - So,

1529
00:55:59,027 --> 00:56:01,925
it'll be around 7:10pm...

1530
00:56:01,926 --> 00:56:04,336
or 7:15pm when we get there.

1531
00:56:04,337 --> 00:56:06,697
You didn't get the quiz in Yangpyeong after using the hint?

1532
00:56:06,806 --> 00:56:08,507
We used the hint long before that.

1533
00:56:09,237 --> 00:56:11,675
- Really? - What are you talking about?

1534
00:56:11,676 --> 00:56:14,107
- The hints are useless. - I see.

1535
00:56:15,107 --> 00:56:17,646
Tae Hyun, we might have to play individual games,

1536
00:56:17,647 --> 00:56:19,487
so tell us what the question is in Yangpyeong.

1537
00:56:19,786 --> 00:56:21,046
- The question for Yangpyeong? - Yes.

1538
00:56:21,047 --> 00:56:22,547
Is it very hard with many twists?

1539
00:56:22,687 --> 00:56:25,087
As for the question in Yangpyeong, I'll tell you...

1540
00:56:25,656 --> 00:56:27,286
when you play the individual match.

1541
00:56:27,687 --> 00:56:29,627
I was going to get some help.

1542
00:56:29,996 --> 00:56:31,957
All I want is to beat Kyung Ho.

1543
00:56:32,797 --> 00:56:34,595
Okay, Tae Hyun.

1544
00:56:34,596 --> 00:56:35,766
- Yes. - Okay.

1545
00:56:36,096 --> 00:56:37,096
(Hanging up)

1546
00:56:37,467 --> 00:56:38,737
I couldn't get the hint.

1547
00:56:39,096 --> 00:56:41,967
I keep feeling that the question in Yangpyeong will be hard.

1548
00:56:42,536 --> 00:56:44,405
It's crazy that we have last hope.

1549
00:56:44,406 --> 00:56:46,236
It'll be around 8pm when we get to the parking lot.

1550
00:56:46,237 --> 00:56:47,445
We're winning...

1551
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:48,583
- by the number of squares. - That's right.

1552
00:56:48,607 --> 00:56:50,615
Even if they get it right in Pocheon, it'll be a tie.

1553
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:52,575
Right. It'll at least be a tie.

1554
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:54,322
- It's a tie though we get it wrong. - That's right.

1555
00:56:54,346 --> 00:56:55,515
Yangpyeong, please.

1556
00:56:55,516 --> 00:56:57,216
Please let there be a quiz that I know the answer to.

1557
00:56:57,217 --> 00:56:58,717
Let's make history today.

1558
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,326
Gosh. Is this the last battleground?

1559
00:57:01,457 --> 00:57:03,656
- I'll park here. - You've arrived at the destination.

1560
00:57:05,156 --> 00:57:06,466
We've arrived eight minutes before the deadline.

1561
00:57:06,467 --> 00:57:07,865
- Good. - Good job.

1562
00:57:07,866 --> 00:57:09,196
- Well done. - Well done.

1563
00:57:09,967 --> 00:57:12,095
- Shall we go in? - Good.

1564
00:57:12,096 --> 00:57:13,436
(Shall we go in?)

1565
00:57:13,437 --> 00:57:14,837
- We can do it. - Excuse me.

1566
00:57:15,406 --> 00:57:16,836
- Hey. - Welcome.

1567
00:57:16,837 --> 00:57:18,635
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

1568
00:57:18,636 --> 00:57:20,206
- Hello. - You're here.

1569
00:57:20,207 --> 00:57:21,745
- Sorry to bother you this late. - Gosh.

1570
00:57:21,746 --> 00:57:23,006
- Hello. - Yes. Welcome.

1571
00:57:23,007 --> 00:57:25,047
I heard the other team came here already.

1572
00:57:25,346 --> 00:57:28,015
- We barge in for the second time. - I'm glad you're here.

1573
00:57:28,016 --> 00:57:29,816
This is an opportunity to meet you.

1574
00:57:29,817 --> 00:57:31,886
I won't be able to meet you otherwise.

1575
00:57:32,087 --> 00:57:33,486
Gosh. Since the elders are here...

1576
00:57:33,487 --> 00:57:34,826
- Happy New Year. - Goodness.

1577
00:57:35,226 --> 00:57:37,155
- Let's do it together. Yes. - Gosh.

1578
00:57:37,156 --> 00:57:38,225
(They bow at each other out of the blue.)

1579
00:57:38,226 --> 00:57:39,396
- Gosh. - Thank you.

1580
00:57:39,397 --> 00:57:41,643
- Goodness. Happy New Year. - You can sit wherever you want.

1581
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,196
- We can sit here. - Okay.

1582
00:57:43,696 --> 00:57:46,067
How did you start creating content for YouTube?

1583
00:57:46,507 --> 00:57:47,866
I'll tell you.

1584
00:57:48,366 --> 00:57:50,876
We moved here.

1585
00:57:50,877 --> 00:57:53,106
I like taking on challenges.

1586
00:57:53,107 --> 00:57:56,007
I like learning and doing stuff.

1587
00:57:56,176 --> 00:57:58,445
- I saw Grandmother Park Mak Rye. - Right.

1588
00:57:58,446 --> 00:58:00,646
- Grandmother Park Mak Rye. - Yes. Grandmother Park Mak Rye.

1589
00:58:00,647 --> 00:58:02,216
Are the sons living here too?

1590
00:58:02,217 --> 00:58:04,457
Yes. We live with our parents.

1591
00:58:05,257 --> 00:58:06,627
Who does the editing?

1592
00:58:06,987 --> 00:58:09,155
My brother and I do the shooting and editing.

1593
00:58:09,156 --> 00:58:11,756
- Mother... - She does all the cooking.

1594
00:58:11,757 --> 00:58:12,796
If you don't mind me asking,

1595
00:58:12,797 --> 00:58:14,425
how old are you?

1596
00:58:14,426 --> 00:58:15,866
I turned 80 this year.

1597
00:58:16,437 --> 00:58:17,535
- That's amazing. - You're 80 years old?

1598
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:18,976
- You don't look like it. - We're...

1599
00:58:19,266 --> 00:58:22,007
(Even they respond the same way as if it were planned before.)

1600
00:58:22,337 --> 00:58:23,776
I'm shocked.

1601
00:58:23,777 --> 00:58:25,475
(The cooking family repeated the same explanation.)

1602
00:58:25,476 --> 00:58:27,107
We want to taste your cooking.

1603
00:58:27,806 --> 00:58:29,845
- But you have to select one. - I have to pick one?

1604
00:58:29,846 --> 00:58:31,006
It's not for the three of us?

1605
00:58:31,217 --> 00:58:33,047
What do you want me to do?

1606
00:58:34,187 --> 00:58:35,845
- It's all right, ma'am. - I want to feed them.

1607
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:38,716
We still get to feel the sentimentality and love here.

1608
00:58:38,717 --> 00:58:39,717
Then...

1609
00:58:40,127 --> 00:58:43,627
I watch a lot of YouTube videos these days.

1610
00:58:43,757 --> 00:58:45,127
Still...

1611
00:58:48,926 --> 00:58:51,437
- Me? - I'll still pick you.

1612
00:58:51,696 --> 00:58:52,836
Gosh. Thank you.

1613
00:58:52,837 --> 00:58:54,866
Which son will join me?

1614
00:58:55,806 --> 00:58:57,575
Yum Yum Family,

1615
00:58:57,576 --> 00:58:59,536
have you been well?

1616
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:02,345
Today, people from a show have come...

1617
00:59:02,346 --> 00:59:04,616
to film us.

1618
00:59:05,446 --> 00:59:07,687
We've invited Handsome Guys.

1619
00:59:08,147 --> 00:59:11,115
The three of the Handsome Guys have been invited.

1620
00:59:11,116 --> 00:59:13,687
I'm Lee Yi Kyung, their stepson during this meal.

1621
00:59:13,987 --> 00:59:15,126
- "Stepson." - I'll try it now...

1622
00:59:15,127 --> 00:59:16,495
on behalf of our members.

1623
00:59:16,496 --> 00:59:17,496
Thanks for the meal.

1624
00:59:17,497 --> 00:59:18,527
- Yes. - Yes.

1625
00:59:18,897 --> 00:59:21,926
- I made bean sprout rice. - Goodness.

1626
00:59:22,426 --> 00:59:23,436
Nice. Steamed buns.

1627
00:59:23,437 --> 00:59:24,536
(Team Guys)

1628
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:28,667
We left the place after seeing all the food,

1629
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:30,107
so I'm so hungry.

1630
00:59:30,636 --> 00:59:31,675
That's...

1631
00:59:31,676 --> 00:59:34,507
When we see Hyo Joon, you should eat the food.

1632
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:35,946
Okay.

1633
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:38,647
- He cooks all the stuff. - He eats ramyeon a lot.

1634
00:59:39,076 --> 00:59:41,047
Watch him cook ramyeon in a cast iron pot.

1635
00:59:41,886 --> 00:59:43,615
Look at the ingredients he adds.

1636
00:59:43,616 --> 00:59:44,885
Thinly-sliced pork belly. Gosh. What is this?

1637
00:59:44,886 --> 00:59:46,155
(The two athletes lose their cool because they're hungry.)

1638
00:59:46,156 --> 00:59:47,826
- Gosh. - He literally pours them in.

1639
00:59:48,187 --> 00:59:50,596
Let's get it right and have some food.

1640
00:59:51,196 --> 00:59:53,825
I think it'll be ramyeon in a cast iron pot lid...

1641
00:59:53,826 --> 00:59:55,027
with octopus.

1642
00:59:56,167 --> 00:59:58,096
- We're here. - What?

1643
00:59:58,266 --> 01:00:00,405
It's the education and culture center.

1644
01:00:00,406 --> 01:00:03,406
They're not in the mountains.

1645
01:00:03,536 --> 01:00:04,536
What's going on?

1646
01:00:05,806 --> 01:00:06,845
Good.

1647
01:00:06,846 --> 01:00:08,175
(Team Guys' last battleground, Pocheon)

1648
01:00:08,176 --> 01:00:09,575
- We're here. - Thank you.

1649
01:00:09,576 --> 01:00:11,917
- Good job. - Thank you for driving.

1650
01:00:12,076 --> 01:00:14,217
- Gosh. - We have a simple situation.

1651
01:00:14,317 --> 01:00:15,817
- Yes. - What's the score?

1652
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:17,486
If we do well, it'll be a tie.

1653
01:00:17,487 --> 01:00:19,456
If they make the cuckoo alarm go off,

1654
01:00:19,457 --> 01:00:21,326
- we'll simply... - We'll give up.

1655
01:00:21,627 --> 01:00:23,225
I'm happy just to meet Burger Brother.

1656
01:00:23,226 --> 01:00:24,397
Okay. After all,

1657
01:00:24,656 --> 01:00:26,095
I'm seeing Hyo Joon after a long time.

1658
01:00:26,096 --> 01:00:27,365
- I love it. - I'm so happy.

1659
01:00:27,366 --> 01:00:28,797
(Park Hyo Joon)

1660
01:00:28,926 --> 01:00:33,206
(Also known as...)

1661
01:00:33,207 --> 01:00:36,036
(Burger Brother)

1662
01:00:37,877 --> 01:00:39,036
We have guests coming?

1663
01:00:39,676 --> 01:00:40,877
Hand me the ramyeon.

1664
01:00:41,607 --> 01:00:43,047
I think something amazing awaits us.

1665
01:00:43,207 --> 01:00:44,876
Gosh. It smells like...

1666
01:00:44,877 --> 01:00:46,046
(The smell travels through darkness and reaches their noses.)

1667
01:00:46,047 --> 01:00:47,445
I can smell the firewood burning.

1668
01:00:47,446 --> 01:00:48,816
There's something special about the smell.

1669
01:00:48,817 --> 01:00:49,845
(The irresistible smell)

1670
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,615
Gosh. It's cold. It's midwinter, indeed.

1671
01:00:51,616 --> 01:00:52,686
(Brothers who are cold and hungry, )

1672
01:00:52,687 --> 01:00:55,257
(come to me.)

1673
01:00:55,726 --> 01:00:56,857
There are three up there.

1674
01:00:56,897 --> 01:00:58,726
Yes.

1675
01:00:59,096 --> 01:01:00,265
- Hello. - Hello.

1676
01:01:00,266 --> 01:01:01,966
- Hello. - You're here.

1677
01:01:01,967 --> 01:01:03,765
Why did you prepare so many things?

1678
01:01:03,766 --> 01:01:05,236
- Hello. - Hyo Joon.

1679
01:01:05,237 --> 01:01:06,357
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

1680
01:01:06,667 --> 01:01:07,736
It's amazing.

1681
01:01:07,737 --> 01:01:09,066
(Handsome Heritage 7: A sweet and scary brother)

1682
01:01:09,067 --> 01:01:10,606
- How have you been? - Nice to meet you.

1683
01:01:10,607 --> 01:01:12,276
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

1684
01:01:12,277 --> 01:01:13,647
(Hello. Nice to meet you.)

1685
01:01:14,446 --> 01:01:16,776
We almost didn't get to see him.

1686
01:01:16,777 --> 01:01:19,986
Since Tae Hyun and the athletes I love were coming,

1687
01:01:19,987 --> 01:01:21,586
- I know. - I wanted to look formal,

1688
01:01:21,587 --> 01:01:22,945
- so I'm wearing a suit. - Gosh.

1689
01:01:22,946 --> 01:01:24,885
- I'm glad we've come here. - Look at you.

1690
01:01:24,886 --> 01:01:27,857
Hello. It's been a while since I saw you on TV.

1691
01:01:29,357 --> 01:01:31,996
I'm the cutest brother in Korea, Burger Brother.

1692
01:01:32,357 --> 01:01:33,467
Nice to meet you.

1693
01:01:33,726 --> 01:01:34,726
(Chanting)

1694
01:01:35,326 --> 01:01:36,326
- Nice. - Nice to meet you.

1695
01:01:36,327 --> 01:01:38,466
- We make videos together. - I know.

1696
01:01:38,467 --> 01:01:39,796
- Yes. - I saw you...

1697
01:01:39,797 --> 01:01:40,905
making ramyeon in the cast iron pot.

1698
01:01:40,906 --> 01:01:41,936
- Really? - Really?

1699
01:01:41,937 --> 01:01:43,206
- Nice to meet you. - He loves your videos.

1700
01:01:43,207 --> 01:01:44,207
Thank you.

1701
01:01:44,208 --> 01:01:46,336
I can tell it'll be amazing by the setup already.

1702
01:01:46,337 --> 01:01:48,046
(The setup is looking amazing already.)

1703
01:01:48,047 --> 01:01:49,575
What is the content of the day?

1704
01:01:49,576 --> 01:01:52,115
Today, we'll make ramyeon with sea mustard and oyster.

1705
01:01:52,116 --> 01:01:53,385
"Ramyeon with sea mustard and oyster?"

1706
01:01:53,386 --> 01:01:54,885
Yes. Ramyeon with sea mustard and oyster.

1707
01:01:54,886 --> 01:01:57,115
That's pork belly in a cast iron pot.

1708
01:01:57,116 --> 01:01:59,116
I sautéed kimchi with it.

1709
01:01:59,717 --> 01:02:00,725
(Amazed)

1710
01:02:00,726 --> 01:02:02,486
- Yes. This is the smell. - I heard...

1711
01:02:02,487 --> 01:02:03,995
you two didn't get to eat.

1712
01:02:03,996 --> 01:02:05,055
- You're right. - We didn't get to eat.

1713
01:02:05,056 --> 01:02:07,027
- We love to eat, though. - Exactly.

1714
01:02:07,167 --> 01:02:08,626
I've set up the basics.

1715
01:02:08,627 --> 01:02:11,736
We just need to add the noodles and prepare the rice.

1716
01:02:11,737 --> 01:02:12,936
This is what's important here.

1717
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:13,966
Do all of us get to participate?

1718
01:02:13,967 --> 01:02:15,506
Will only one person get to eat?

1719
01:02:15,507 --> 01:02:17,476
Here, everyone can eat.

1720
01:02:18,076 --> 01:02:19,106
How nice.

1721
01:02:19,107 --> 01:02:20,107
(It's good news.)

1722
01:02:20,107 --> 01:02:21,107
Please.

1723
01:02:21,108 --> 01:02:24,345
The concept involves cooking an entire box of ramyeon.

1724
01:02:24,346 --> 01:02:25,575
How many packets are in a box?

1725
01:02:25,576 --> 01:02:27,187
Some have 32 packets...

1726
01:02:27,647 --> 01:02:29,592
- while others have 40 packets. - Did you say 32?

1727
01:02:29,616 --> 01:02:30,616
There's nothing special.

1728
01:02:30,617 --> 01:02:32,486
This YouTube channel has the concept...

1729
01:02:32,487 --> 01:02:34,526
of serving people tasty food...

1730
01:02:34,527 --> 01:02:35,956
in a natural way.

1731
01:02:35,957 --> 01:02:37,595
Is there another content you're promoting...

1732
01:02:37,596 --> 01:02:39,156
other than the eating show?

1733
01:02:39,656 --> 01:02:41,566
There's a content about the thug style.

1734
01:02:41,567 --> 01:02:45,166
Thug style? Do you make videos in which you act like a thug?

1735
01:02:45,167 --> 01:02:47,167
I make such videos.

1736
01:02:47,266 --> 01:02:48,512
- Can you give us an example? - I want to watch the videos.

1737
01:02:48,536 --> 01:02:49,805
Dong Hyun, it's good to see you.

1738
01:02:49,806 --> 01:02:50,837
(Transforming)

1739
01:02:51,207 --> 01:02:52,207
- Hello. - Dong Hyun, it's good to see you.

1740
01:02:52,208 --> 01:02:53,808
- Are you working out diligently? - Yes.

1741
01:02:54,147 --> 01:02:55,475
- You're cute. - All right.

1742
01:02:55,476 --> 01:02:56,716
Sang Uk, it's good to see you.

1743
01:02:56,717 --> 01:02:58,075
- You should get down more. - Okay.

1744
01:02:58,076 --> 01:02:59,277
It's like this.

1745
01:02:59,377 --> 01:03:00,416
It's funny.

1746
01:03:00,417 --> 01:03:03,086
- Men act cool... - Yes.

1747
01:03:03,087 --> 01:03:05,127
- until the day they die. - That's what it's about.

1748
01:03:05,187 --> 01:03:07,686
- How nice! - It's funny.

1749
01:03:07,687 --> 01:03:08,725
(Is that so?)

1750
01:03:08,726 --> 01:03:10,026
Dong Hyun, why don't you bring ramyeon?

1751
01:03:10,027 --> 01:03:11,027
Yes, sir.

1752
01:03:11,028 --> 01:03:12,495
- Dong Hyun, bring ramyeon. - Yes, sir.

1753
01:03:12,496 --> 01:03:13,496
Please order me around with ease.

1754
01:03:13,497 --> 01:03:15,097
- Dong Hyun, put it in here. - Yes, sir.

1755
01:03:15,326 --> 01:03:16,865
A box of ramyeon is going in.

1756
01:03:16,866 --> 01:03:17,866
Okay.

1757
01:03:17,866 --> 01:03:18,866
(Adding a box of ramyeon)

1758
01:03:20,567 --> 01:03:21,607
Add them at once.

1759
01:03:21,766 --> 01:03:22,836
Add them.

1760
01:03:22,837 --> 01:03:23,837
(Scraping...)

1761
01:03:23,838 --> 01:03:24,906
(to add all the noodles)

1762
01:03:26,476 --> 01:03:28,106
(He cooks them at once.)

1763
01:03:28,107 --> 01:03:30,116
The entire box went in.

1764
01:03:30,676 --> 01:03:31,845
Sang Uk, get the bowls...

1765
01:03:31,846 --> 01:03:33,377
- instead of clapping. - Yes, sir.

1766
01:03:33,846 --> 01:03:35,785
- Am I doing okay? - Of course.

1767
01:03:35,786 --> 01:03:37,586
- Put yourself at ease. - I usually don't do such things.

1768
01:03:37,587 --> 01:03:39,427
It has been a while since I visited a TV show.

1769
01:03:39,757 --> 01:03:40,986
Put yourself at ease.

1770
01:03:40,987 --> 01:03:43,126
Hyo Joon is...

1771
01:03:43,127 --> 01:03:45,226
- a nice man. - That's right.

1772
01:03:45,326 --> 01:03:47,095
- Put yourself at ease. - Do you eat oysters?

1773
01:03:47,096 --> 01:03:48,667
- I love oysters. - Really?

1774
01:03:48,797 --> 01:03:50,837
I added about 50 dollars' worth of oysters.

1775
01:03:52,536 --> 01:03:54,436
Shouldn't it boil harder?

1776
01:03:54,437 --> 01:03:56,466
Of course. Dong Hyun, read the room and get to work then.

1777
01:03:56,467 --> 01:03:58,236
Yes, sir. I'll give it a go.

1778
01:03:58,237 --> 01:03:59,737
- Give it a go. - Okay.

1779
01:04:00,406 --> 01:04:01,506
All right.

1780
01:04:01,507 --> 01:04:03,076
(He reads the room and gets to work.)

1781
01:04:04,446 --> 01:04:06,316
Don't scrape the bottom.

1782
01:04:06,317 --> 01:04:07,486
Why not?

1783
01:04:07,487 --> 01:04:08,816
We need to use the cauldron lid again.

1784
01:04:08,817 --> 01:04:10,986
- We shouldn't scratch it. - Okay.

1785
01:04:10,987 --> 01:04:12,956
- We aren't so well-off, Dong Hyun. - Okay.

1786
01:04:12,957 --> 01:04:14,655
(Laughing)

1787
01:04:14,656 --> 01:04:15,726
That's funny.

1788
01:04:16,326 --> 01:04:17,456
(Meat and ramyeon get cooked.)

1789
01:04:17,457 --> 01:04:18,926
This is a work of art.

1790
01:04:19,156 --> 01:04:20,826
Ramyeon looks amazing.

1791
01:04:21,467 --> 01:04:23,507
I'm excited that you guys will eat. Thank goodness.

1792
01:04:24,196 --> 01:04:25,296
Let's reduce it.

1793
01:04:25,297 --> 01:04:26,566
- It's over. - Shall I turn off the heat?

1794
01:04:26,567 --> 01:04:28,006
It's over.

1795
01:04:28,007 --> 01:04:30,406
I'll try the dish...

1796
01:04:30,837 --> 01:04:31,976
with kimchi.

1797
01:04:32,107 --> 01:04:33,607
Dong Hyun must be very hungry.

1798
01:04:35,576 --> 01:04:36,916
(My goodness)

1799
01:04:36,917 --> 01:04:38,047
It came out well.

1800
01:04:39,076 --> 01:04:40,446
I guess he was very hungry.

1801
01:04:40,516 --> 01:04:42,086
- He was totally hungry. - Yes.

1802
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:43,345
This is the second meal.

1803
01:04:43,346 --> 01:04:45,786
- That's insane. - Only I got to eat earlier.

1804
01:04:46,087 --> 01:04:48,656
- Hey, you should hold it. - Yes. I'll hold it.

1805
01:04:48,757 --> 01:04:50,396
- My ramyeon? - Yes.

1806
01:04:50,397 --> 01:04:51,933
- There are skills. - An expert should do it.

1807
01:04:51,957 --> 01:04:53,297
Really? What skills?

1808
01:04:54,027 --> 01:04:56,225
The food is hot. We don't want to burn his hands.

1809
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:58,336
(A generous amount)

1810
01:04:58,337 --> 01:04:59,496
It's no joke.

1811
01:04:59,737 --> 01:05:01,206
(Pushing with his foot)

1812
01:05:01,207 --> 01:05:03,535
- You turned it off with your foot. - That's right.

1813
01:05:03,536 --> 01:05:04,536
He did it in one go.

1814
01:05:05,036 --> 01:05:06,876
- Look. - He turned it off with his foot.

1815
01:05:06,877 --> 01:05:07,946
(Here comes the ramyeon.)

1816
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,106
He did it one go.

1817
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:11,776
I think there are about five packets in there.

1818
01:05:11,777 --> 01:05:14,615
I think there are about four packets in there.

1819
01:05:14,616 --> 01:05:17,286
Four packets went into one bowl. Seriously.

1820
01:05:17,687 --> 01:05:20,055
- No way. - More food keeps coming out.

1821
01:05:20,056 --> 01:05:21,555
(Never ending ramyeon)

1822
01:05:21,556 --> 01:05:22,786
What's this?

1823
01:05:22,826 --> 01:05:24,346
Noodles are coming up from the bottom.

1824
01:05:24,726 --> 01:05:26,695
The scale is huge.

1825
01:05:26,696 --> 01:05:27,696
(There's so much food.)

1826
01:05:27,697 --> 01:05:28,796
Will you put the dish here?

1827
01:05:28,797 --> 01:05:30,095
That's...

1828
01:05:30,096 --> 01:05:32,566
(Pocheon Gang goes big to welcome the guests.)

1829
01:05:32,567 --> 01:05:34,365
- Put it in here. - It's a proper eating show.

1830
01:05:34,366 --> 01:05:35,936
- Sang Uk. - I'll do it.

1831
01:05:35,937 --> 01:05:38,076
I don't want to leave any food behind.

1832
01:05:39,076 --> 01:05:42,246
(He takes a bite so that he doesn't waste food.)

1833
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:44,176
(Impressed)

1834
01:05:45,846 --> 01:05:49,917
(I won't miss a single piece.)

1835
01:05:50,386 --> 01:05:52,056
No words are needed.

1836
01:05:52,087 --> 01:05:54,925
This is ramyeon with seaweed and oysters.

1837
01:05:54,926 --> 01:05:57,555
It has been made with a box of ramyeon.

1838
01:05:57,556 --> 01:06:00,127
Then there's pork belly with aged kimchi.

1839
01:06:00,297 --> 01:06:01,865
(My goodness)

1840
01:06:01,866 --> 01:06:03,325
Seung Ho, seriously...

1841
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:04,466
(The last message to Seung Ho, the member who loves ramyeon)

1842
01:06:04,467 --> 01:06:06,596
- You should've come here. - For real.

1843
01:06:07,507 --> 01:06:08,507
You should've come here.

1844
01:06:08,508 --> 01:06:10,708
- This place is insane. - Seung Ho should've come here.

1845
01:06:10,937 --> 01:06:12,607
- We need to tease him. - Thank you.

1846
01:06:13,647 --> 01:06:15,745
- Tae Hyun, please eat. - Hurry up and eat.

1847
01:06:15,746 --> 01:06:17,945
- There are no side plates, right? - There are...

1848
01:06:17,946 --> 01:06:18,946
- no side plates. - I see.

1849
01:06:18,947 --> 01:06:20,816
We didn't have the budget. We're sorry.

1850
01:06:20,817 --> 01:06:22,945
- Do you eat standing up? - Yes.

1851
01:06:22,946 --> 01:06:24,156
There are no chairs.

1852
01:06:24,357 --> 01:06:26,056
- Let's eat. - There's no budget.

1853
01:06:26,057 --> 01:06:27,185
- Ramyeon. - You eat on the spot.

1854
01:06:27,186 --> 01:06:29,086
We're going in the order of age,

1855
01:06:29,087 --> 01:06:30,355
- so you need to eat first. - Okay.

1856
01:06:30,356 --> 01:06:32,696
I'll eat the noodles with oysters and seaweed.

1857
01:06:35,526 --> 01:06:36,825
Since the oldest member took a bite, let's begin eating.

1858
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,696
- Eat. - Thank you for the food.

1859
01:06:39,396 --> 01:06:41,065
(They've waited for this moment.)

1860
01:06:41,066 --> 01:06:42,436
It's our 1st meal in 10 hours.

1861
01:06:43,267 --> 01:06:44,576
It's our 1st meal in 10 hours.

1862
01:06:46,576 --> 01:06:49,377
(His eyes go wide.)

1863
01:06:50,877 --> 01:06:51,877
It's tasty, right?

1864
01:06:53,717 --> 01:06:54,887
It's hot.

1865
01:06:56,917 --> 01:06:57,956
It's hot.

1866
01:06:57,957 --> 01:07:02,387
(Even though it's hot, he can't wait any longer.)

1867
01:07:07,196 --> 01:07:10,097
(He blows on the food.)

1868
01:07:11,066 --> 01:07:13,535
(He practically eats one packet in a single bite.)

1869
01:07:13,536 --> 01:07:14,936
It's insane.

1870
01:07:20,276 --> 01:07:21,307
Let's put it here.

1871
01:07:23,717 --> 01:07:28,216
(Their body reacts to the electrifying taste.)

1872
01:07:28,217 --> 01:07:29,286
It's tasty, right?

1873
01:07:29,946 --> 01:07:31,116
It's so tasty.

1874
01:07:31,957 --> 01:07:33,926
When you cook so many packets, it could be bland.

1875
01:07:33,927 --> 01:07:35,256
But the seasoning is perfect.

1876
01:07:35,257 --> 01:07:37,126
It isn't red, but it's spicy.

1877
01:07:37,127 --> 01:07:38,496
- It's a bit spicy, right? - Yes.

1878
01:07:38,627 --> 01:07:39,655
It's so nice.

1879
01:07:39,656 --> 01:07:42,866
If you cook 40 packets, you use 8 big bottles of water.

1880
01:07:43,427 --> 01:07:45,136
If you cook 32 packets,

1881
01:07:45,137 --> 01:07:46,537
you use seven big bottles of water.

1882
01:07:46,767 --> 01:07:48,706
- You're precise. - It has been calculated.

1883
01:07:48,707 --> 01:07:50,007
How is it so tasty with seaweed?

1884
01:07:50,167 --> 01:07:51,207
It's tasty.

1885
01:07:51,337 --> 01:07:52,575
It's so refreshing.

1886
01:07:52,576 --> 01:07:53,745
Sang Uk, say something.

1887
01:07:53,746 --> 01:07:54,876
(Slurping)

1888
01:07:54,877 --> 01:07:56,546
(Slurping)

1889
01:07:56,547 --> 01:07:57,846
I should add seaweed to ramyeon.

1890
01:07:57,847 --> 01:08:00,177
It's tasty with seaweed. It has the aroma of oysters too.

1891
01:08:00,276 --> 01:08:02,416
The staff members should eat it.

1892
01:08:02,417 --> 01:08:04,517
- They must eat it. - It's tasty.

1893
01:08:04,786 --> 01:08:07,025
Take all of these bowls.

1894
01:08:07,026 --> 01:08:08,186
It's so tasty.

1895
01:08:08,427 --> 01:08:10,855
Take all of these bowls. Take one each.

1896
01:08:10,856 --> 01:08:11,927
(It's a feast.)

1897
01:08:12,196 --> 01:08:14,565
- I'll eat this too. - Try it.

1898
01:08:14,566 --> 01:08:15,767
Try the meat.

1899
01:08:16,326 --> 01:08:18,365
It's insane.

1900
01:08:18,366 --> 01:08:19,565
(He puts some on white rice.)

1901
01:08:19,566 --> 01:08:22,267
You remember the people with whom you ate tasty food.

1902
01:08:23,307 --> 01:08:24,307
It's tasty.

1903
01:08:25,007 --> 01:08:26,506
(Trembling)

1904
01:08:26,507 --> 01:08:28,075
- It's insane. - The noodles will get soggy.

1905
01:08:28,076 --> 01:08:29,105
Since it has been cooked...

1906
01:08:29,106 --> 01:08:32,346
on the cauldron lid, it has a smoky flavour.

1907
01:08:32,347 --> 01:08:34,087
The smoky flavour is the best.

1908
01:08:34,686 --> 01:08:39,457
(Extremely happy)

1909
01:08:40,017 --> 01:08:41,456
It looks tasty. I'll eat it too.

1910
01:08:41,457 --> 01:08:43,026
(He succumbs and opens instant rice.)

1911
01:08:44,026 --> 01:08:45,396
I wasn't going to eat rice.

1912
01:08:47,196 --> 01:08:49,226
(Meat...)

1913
01:08:49,227 --> 01:08:52,196
(and rice is the best combination.)

1914
01:08:52,297 --> 01:08:54,207
- It's tasty, right? - It's the real deal.

1915
01:08:54,307 --> 01:08:56,167
You should eat well.

1916
01:09:00,746 --> 01:09:02,046
Sang Uk, do you need to leave after eating?

1917
01:09:02,047 --> 01:09:03,287
Why aren't you saying anything?

1918
01:09:03,816 --> 01:09:05,645
You shouldn't be like this on a variety show.

1919
01:09:05,646 --> 01:09:07,217
Bring a fencing sword.

1920
01:09:07,946 --> 01:09:10,047
Bring a fencing sword. You shouldn't be like this.

1921
01:09:10,616 --> 01:09:11,916
- You should be careful. - It's so tasty.

1922
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:13,257
- Is it tasty? - It's so tasty.

1923
01:09:13,286 --> 01:09:14,587
Seriously, it's so tasty.

1924
01:09:14,887 --> 01:09:17,756
How did you begin this channel?

1925
01:09:17,757 --> 01:09:19,556
These days, women love...

1926
01:09:19,557 --> 01:09:23,026
shows such as "Single's Inferno" and "I'm Solo."

1927
01:09:23,097 --> 01:09:25,065
But men love shows...

1928
01:09:25,066 --> 01:09:26,466
- such as "I Am a Natural Person." - Yes.

1929
01:09:26,467 --> 01:09:28,267
So I thought about why men liked that show...

1930
01:09:28,606 --> 01:09:30,977
and realized that men want to live alone.

1931
01:09:31,877 --> 01:09:32,905
(Laughing)

1932
01:09:32,906 --> 01:09:35,445
Men want to leave everything behind and live alone...

1933
01:09:35,446 --> 01:09:36,645
in the woods.

1934
01:09:36,646 --> 01:09:39,115
We thought it'd be funny to eat chicken soup...

1935
01:09:39,116 --> 01:09:40,315
in the countryside.

1936
01:09:40,316 --> 01:09:42,016
So we came to the countryside...

1937
01:09:42,017 --> 01:09:43,886
to enjoy the scenery.

1938
01:09:43,887 --> 01:09:45,457
We're enjoying our lives.

1939
01:09:45,816 --> 01:09:47,826
The timing was perfect.

1940
01:09:49,927 --> 01:09:51,895
Try this as well.

1941
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:52,957
It's tasty.

1942
01:09:53,696 --> 01:09:54,895
White kimchi.

1943
01:09:54,896 --> 01:09:56,816
(It's the water kimchi that impressed Tae Hyun.)

1944
01:10:00,066 --> 01:10:02,935
This white kimchi is so tasty.

1945
01:10:02,936 --> 01:10:04,806
When you begin eating this kimchi,

1946
01:10:04,807 --> 01:10:06,736
you end up finishing the entire container.

1947
01:10:06,936 --> 01:10:08,547
I eat a little at a time.

1948
01:10:09,677 --> 01:10:10,946
A little at a time.

1949
01:10:11,347 --> 01:10:12,977
Now, the young radish.

1950
01:10:13,746 --> 01:10:14,816
It must be so crunchy.

1951
01:10:15,047 --> 01:10:16,716
(Crunchy)

1952
01:10:16,717 --> 01:10:18,815
Yi Kyung, you like kimchi.

1953
01:10:18,816 --> 01:10:20,856
I like everything.

1954
01:10:22,257 --> 01:10:23,387
You want to eat, right?

1955
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:24,757
Yes.

1956
01:10:25,097 --> 01:10:26,926
Then please sing the jingle...

1957
01:10:26,927 --> 01:10:28,826
of Handsome Guys.

1958
01:10:29,896 --> 01:10:31,235
(It's too much.)

1959
01:10:31,236 --> 01:10:32,995
They might become flustered.

1960
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:35,167
Just give a sneak peek.

1961
01:10:35,637 --> 01:10:37,905
Does Handsome Guys have...

1962
01:10:37,906 --> 01:10:40,435
- a jingle? - We sang it a few times.

1963
01:10:40,436 --> 01:10:41,546
Let's sing together then.

1964
01:10:41,547 --> 01:10:43,307
- Ma'am. - Sing a small part.

1965
01:10:43,746 --> 01:10:45,216
(A performance of Handsome Guys' jingle)

1966
01:10:45,217 --> 01:10:46,946
One, two, three, four.

1967
01:10:47,746 --> 01:10:49,285
(One, two, three, four!)

1968
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:50,757
Ma'am, this isn't the rhythm.

1969
01:10:53,186 --> 01:10:55,026
(Laughing)

1970
01:10:55,326 --> 01:10:56,525
It's slower than "Bird Taryeong."

1971
01:10:56,526 --> 01:10:58,557
It's rhythm and blues. I'm sorry.

1972
01:10:59,996 --> 01:11:01,096
Let's begin.

1973
01:11:01,097 --> 01:11:02,097
(Grooving)

1974
01:11:02,467 --> 01:11:05,167
(Oh, Handsome Guys)

1975
01:11:05,436 --> 01:11:06,597
(We are)

1976
01:11:07,066 --> 01:11:08,066
Go ahead.

1977
01:11:09,236 --> 01:11:12,137
(Oh, Handsome Guys)

1978
01:11:13,007 --> 01:11:15,377
- Then... - We are

1979
01:11:16,007 --> 01:11:19,047
(Kyung Ho ends up singing alone.)

1980
01:11:19,547 --> 01:11:22,216
I forgot because I sang so much.

1981
01:11:22,217 --> 01:11:23,546
You shouldn't just kept going with your spirits.

1982
01:11:23,547 --> 01:11:25,155
I'm always full of spirits.

1983
01:11:25,156 --> 01:11:27,887
(The second attempt)

1984
01:11:28,727 --> 01:11:31,355
(Oh, Handsome Guys)

1985
01:11:31,356 --> 01:11:32,427
(We are)

1986
01:11:33,896 --> 01:11:35,365
(Oh)

1987
01:11:35,366 --> 01:11:37,596
(Handsome Guys)

1988
01:11:37,597 --> 01:11:38,597
(Oh)

1989
01:11:39,996 --> 01:11:41,006
Go.

1990
01:11:41,007 --> 01:11:42,036
(We are)

1991
01:11:43,606 --> 01:11:45,736
(We're Handsome Guys)

1992
01:11:45,776 --> 01:11:47,575
- It goes like that. - It goes like that.

1993
01:11:47,576 --> 01:11:48,605
I'm sorry about the pause.

1994
01:11:48,606 --> 01:11:50,347
Finding the right note...

1995
01:11:50,646 --> 01:11:52,616
- It isn't easy. - It's hard.

1996
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:54,397
- Seung Ho, hurry up and eat. - Okay.

1997
01:11:56,547 --> 01:11:58,756
(He gives an encore performance no one asked for.)

1998
01:11:58,757 --> 01:12:01,426
Food is tastier when it's shared.

1999
01:12:01,427 --> 01:12:02,486
Just a bite.

2000
01:12:04,356 --> 01:12:07,155
- Thank you. - Put it on the lettuce.

2001
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:09,727
- One wrap. - Shall I put it on the lettuce...

2002
01:12:09,797 --> 01:12:10,865
- and eat? - Yes.

2003
01:12:10,866 --> 01:12:12,365
Please go ahead.

2004
01:12:12,366 --> 01:12:13,467
- I'll go first. - Okay.

2005
01:12:14,106 --> 01:12:16,206
- Please excuse me. - Okay.

2006
01:12:16,207 --> 01:12:17,377
I'll make it tasty.

2007
01:12:18,207 --> 01:12:19,707
It looks good.

2008
01:12:20,076 --> 01:12:21,206
It looks good, right?

2009
01:12:21,207 --> 01:12:24,116
This could be sold at a restaurant.

2010
01:12:24,847 --> 01:12:25,946
Is it that tasty?

2011
01:12:26,677 --> 01:12:27,816
Try it.

2012
01:12:27,986 --> 01:12:29,217
Hurry up.

2013
01:12:31,957 --> 01:12:33,816
He's getting a variety of food.

2014
01:12:34,486 --> 01:12:35,825
(He wraps up with the bean sprout rice.)

2015
01:12:35,826 --> 01:12:37,355
- You need it for the wrap. - Yi Kyung,

2016
01:12:37,356 --> 01:12:39,655
Kyung Ho is precise.

2017
01:12:39,656 --> 01:12:42,366
He's getting all the dishes I have my eyes on.

2018
01:12:43,066 --> 01:12:45,036
I want to get everything,

2019
01:12:45,496 --> 01:12:47,036
but my mouth doesn't open so wide.

2020
01:12:48,436 --> 01:12:51,007
I didn't want to show this side of me...

2021
01:12:51,177 --> 01:12:53,106
on TV,

2022
01:12:53,837 --> 01:12:55,477
but the food looked so tasty.

2023
01:12:55,606 --> 01:12:57,276
It's nice to show such a side.

2024
01:12:58,477 --> 01:12:59,917
- Thank you for the food. - Okay.

2025
01:13:00,446 --> 01:13:04,456
(Eating)

2026
01:13:04,457 --> 01:13:06,286
you could do an eating show.

2027
01:13:06,587 --> 01:13:08,056
(His eyes go wide.)

2028
01:13:08,057 --> 01:13:09,587
You ate neatly.

2029
01:13:11,557 --> 01:13:13,026
It's no joke, right?

2030
01:13:14,927 --> 01:13:17,166
- I'll go next. - Okay.

2031
01:13:17,167 --> 01:13:18,496
(Seung Ho goes next.)

2032
01:13:18,597 --> 01:13:20,466
- Two lettuce leaves. - Two.

2033
01:13:20,467 --> 01:13:21,565
I'm not being greedy.

2034
01:13:21,566 --> 01:13:23,536
I'll just take what I'll eat.

2035
01:13:24,307 --> 01:13:25,836
(A careful expert in eating)

2036
01:13:25,837 --> 01:13:27,546
- He eats with gusto. - Yes.

2037
01:13:27,547 --> 01:13:29,177
He looks that way.

2038
01:13:29,347 --> 01:13:31,476
(Two pieces of stir-fried pork)

2039
01:13:31,477 --> 01:13:32,616
Can you feel it?

2040
01:13:33,547 --> 01:13:35,186
If you eat that wrap...

2041
01:13:35,347 --> 01:13:38,087
- I must add rice. - Rice.

2042
01:13:39,116 --> 01:13:41,586
(Bean sprout rice is a must!)

2043
01:13:41,587 --> 01:13:42,627
Add more meat.

2044
01:13:42,957 --> 01:13:44,126
(Wrapping up with chilli leaves)

2045
01:13:44,127 --> 01:13:45,995
It needs to go into my mouth,

2046
01:13:45,996 --> 01:13:47,057
so I'll get...

2047
01:13:48,097 --> 01:13:49,166
this much.

2048
01:13:49,167 --> 01:13:52,436
(He finished making a huge wrap!)

2049
01:13:52,496 --> 01:13:54,866
You look so excited right now.

2050
01:13:55,167 --> 01:13:57,035
I think the size is just right.

2051
01:13:57,036 --> 01:13:58,677
(Get ready.)

2052
01:14:00,137 --> 01:14:03,446
(Eating)

2053
01:14:03,606 --> 01:14:07,786
(A round of applause)

2054
01:14:08,717 --> 01:14:10,485
(I'll talk after swallowing.)

2055
01:14:10,486 --> 01:14:12,486
Well done. You deserve a gold medal.

2056
01:14:12,757 --> 01:14:15,185
- Kyung Ho, how was the taste? - It was so tasty.

2057
01:14:15,186 --> 01:14:17,056
I feel bad about just saying,

2058
01:14:17,057 --> 01:14:19,195
"It was tasty."

2059
01:14:19,196 --> 01:14:23,267
The bean sprouts tasted so savoury thanks to soy sauce.

2060
01:14:23,366 --> 01:14:25,297
There was so much umami.

2061
01:14:25,696 --> 01:14:27,235
Stir-fried pork was so tasty.

2062
01:14:27,236 --> 01:14:28,435
It went really well with the rice.

2063
01:14:28,436 --> 01:14:30,707
Then white kimchi enveloped everything...

2064
01:14:30,736 --> 01:14:34,446
and chilli leaves added saltiness.

2065
01:14:34,507 --> 01:14:38,276
I could see why you made these dishes together.

2066
01:14:38,316 --> 01:14:40,785
- Thank you. - The flavours were no joke.

2067
01:14:40,786 --> 01:14:42,347
- Thank you. - They were so tasty.

2068
01:14:42,616 --> 01:14:45,057
We mixed up the dishes, right?

2069
01:14:45,186 --> 01:14:47,956
But not a single dish stood out...

2070
01:14:47,957 --> 01:14:49,927
because the seasoning was perfect.

2071
01:14:50,127 --> 01:14:52,096
They were so tasty.

2072
01:14:52,097 --> 01:14:53,927
Like soccer players of different positions,

2073
01:14:53,996 --> 01:14:56,167
each of the dishes had a position.

2074
01:14:56,566 --> 01:14:58,336
These dishes make a team.

2075
01:14:58,337 --> 01:14:59,836
- Thank you. - Thank you for the food.

2076
01:14:59,837 --> 01:15:01,535
Thank you for the high praise.

2077
01:15:01,536 --> 01:15:02,706
(The feast of home-cooked food ends.)

2078
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:04,606
Ma'am, sir,

2079
01:15:04,707 --> 01:15:08,075
thank you for the invitation.

2080
01:15:08,076 --> 01:15:09,806
- Thank you for coming. - Please stay healthy...

2081
01:15:09,807 --> 01:15:10,977
and have a happy New Year.

2082
01:15:11,047 --> 01:15:12,145
Thank you.

2083
01:15:12,146 --> 01:15:14,446
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2084
01:15:15,217 --> 01:15:17,386
- We'll move on to the quiz. - The quiz.

2085
01:15:17,387 --> 01:15:19,092
- Let's go. - It's the last quiz of the day.

2086
01:15:19,116 --> 01:15:21,257
- Quiz. - Yes.

2087
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:25,427
In 2021, Oxford English Dictionary...

2088
01:15:25,696 --> 01:15:28,667
added a Korean word, "Mukbang," and became the talk of the town.

2089
01:15:29,127 --> 01:15:33,035
Even recently, Korean words got added to this dictionary.

2090
01:15:33,036 --> 01:15:34,206
Now,

2091
01:15:34,207 --> 01:15:37,435
which one of the following words didn't get added?

2092
01:15:37,436 --> 01:15:38,853
It's a multiple-choice question. Wait.

2093
01:15:38,877 --> 01:15:40,677
Number one, hyung.

2094
01:15:41,377 --> 01:15:43,507
Number two, noraebang.

2095
01:15:44,276 --> 01:15:46,646
Number three, dalgona.

2096
01:15:47,316 --> 01:15:49,615
Number four, samgyetang.

2097
01:15:49,616 --> 01:15:52,356
(Hyung, noraebang, dalgona, samgyetang)

2098
01:15:52,917 --> 01:15:54,256
I think...

2099
01:15:54,257 --> 01:15:56,757
dalgona came up because of "Squid Game."

2100
01:15:57,057 --> 01:15:59,525
But wasn't it called "Bbopgi" in the drama?

2101
01:15:59,526 --> 01:16:02,025
- "Mukbang" got added... - Mukbang.

2102
01:16:02,026 --> 01:16:06,036
- thanks to the contents. - That's right.

2103
01:16:06,337 --> 01:16:09,735
As for "Hyung..." Streamers always go,

2104
01:16:09,736 --> 01:16:10,877
"Hello, hyungnim."

2105
01:16:11,337 --> 01:16:14,206
They often call the viewers and subscribers...

2106
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:16,146
"Hyungnim."

2107
01:16:16,507 --> 01:16:18,616
As for "Noraebang," people sing covers there.

2108
01:16:18,746 --> 01:16:20,517
It became popular through contents.

2109
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,816
"Dalgona" is associated with "Squid Game."

2110
01:16:22,887 --> 01:16:24,893
Like you said, there's a chance it was called "Bbopgi."

2111
01:16:24,917 --> 01:16:27,526
In any case, it became popular through contents.

2112
01:16:27,587 --> 01:16:29,587
But there were no contents regarding "Samgyetang."

2113
01:16:29,727 --> 01:16:33,825
The Oxford English Dictionary adds new words...

2114
01:16:33,826 --> 01:16:37,767
only if they can be used by people around the world.

2115
01:16:37,797 --> 01:16:40,035
Was there something about samgyetang?

2116
01:16:40,036 --> 01:16:41,435
(Team Handsome gets closer to the answer.)

2117
01:16:41,436 --> 01:16:44,036
We keep digging into it by ourselves.

2118
01:16:44,106 --> 01:16:46,905
Shall we make the cameramen have an anonymous vote?

2119
01:16:46,906 --> 01:16:48,122
(Shall we make the cameramen have an anonymous vote?)

2120
01:16:48,146 --> 01:16:49,877
You guys don't know either, right?

2121
01:16:50,246 --> 01:16:52,315
No one has lived in Oxford, right?

2122
01:16:52,316 --> 01:16:53,716
(By any chance)

2123
01:16:53,717 --> 01:16:54,985
No one knows.

2124
01:16:54,986 --> 01:16:56,546
We'll ask the cameramen who are standing up.

2125
01:16:56,547 --> 01:16:57,856
Who thinks it's "Hyung?"

2126
01:16:58,517 --> 01:17:00,217
Hyung. One, two, three.

2127
01:17:00,286 --> 01:17:01,557
- Four. - Four.

2128
01:17:02,186 --> 01:17:03,627
How about "Noraebang?"

2129
01:17:04,156 --> 01:17:05,226
(Not moving)

2130
01:17:05,227 --> 01:17:07,096
No one. Who thinks it's "Dalgona?"

2131
01:17:07,097 --> 01:17:09,065
(Who thinks it's "Dalgona?")

2132
01:17:09,066 --> 01:17:10,266
Who thinks it's "Samgyetang?"

2133
01:17:10,267 --> 01:17:11,637
(Who thinks it's "Samgyetang?")

2134
01:17:12,137 --> 01:17:13,196
See?

2135
01:17:13,637 --> 01:17:15,566
No one voted for "Noraebang" and "Dalgona."

2136
01:17:16,207 --> 01:17:17,606
At this rate...

2137
01:17:17,677 --> 01:17:19,336
Even if we answer incorrectly, it'll be a tie.

2138
01:17:19,337 --> 01:17:21,007
But I want to get it right.

2139
01:17:22,507 --> 01:17:23,677
I wrote them in English.

2140
01:17:24,047 --> 01:17:25,477
Which one looks the strangest?

2141
01:17:26,017 --> 01:17:27,075
Hyung.

2142
01:17:27,076 --> 01:17:28,245
Noraebang.

2143
01:17:28,246 --> 01:17:29,486
Dalgona.

2144
01:17:29,517 --> 01:17:30,615
Samgyetang.

2145
01:17:30,616 --> 01:17:32,156
- Hyung. - "Hyung?"

2146
01:17:32,757 --> 01:17:35,057
- Hyung. - "Hyung?" Why?

2147
01:17:35,757 --> 01:17:36,826
Hyung.

2148
01:17:37,156 --> 01:17:39,495
Is it H, Y, U, N, G?

2149
01:17:39,496 --> 01:17:40,626
- Hyung. - Hyung.

2150
01:17:40,627 --> 01:17:42,395
They can't pronounce "Hyung."

2151
01:17:42,396 --> 01:17:43,626
- Hyung. - Hyung.

2152
01:17:43,627 --> 01:17:44,797
Hyung.

2153
01:17:45,597 --> 01:17:47,035
(Laughing)

2154
01:17:47,036 --> 01:17:49,066
- I think it's "Hyung." - "Hyung?"

2155
01:17:49,936 --> 01:17:51,276
Hyung.

2156
01:17:51,637 --> 01:17:53,376
- Dalgona. - Noraebang.

2157
01:17:53,377 --> 01:17:55,105
Dalgona. Samgyetang.

2158
01:17:55,106 --> 01:17:57,677
- Hyung. - Samgyetang.

2159
01:17:58,576 --> 01:17:59,775
Samgyetang.

2160
01:17:59,776 --> 01:18:00,846
(He gets a reality check.)

2161
01:18:00,847 --> 01:18:02,016
Y, E...

2162
01:18:02,017 --> 01:18:04,856
- I think I saw it in Myeongdong. - That's right.

2163
01:18:04,957 --> 01:18:06,086
G, Y, E...

2164
01:18:06,087 --> 01:18:07,256
"Mukbang?"

2165
01:18:07,257 --> 01:18:09,156
Hyung. H, Y, U, N, G.

2166
01:18:09,257 --> 01:18:11,226
I think it's "Hyung."

2167
01:18:11,227 --> 01:18:12,627
- Hyung. - Hyung.

2168
01:18:12,826 --> 01:18:14,525
- Hyung. - Hyung.

2169
01:18:14,526 --> 01:18:16,895
(Laughing)

2170
01:18:16,896 --> 01:18:19,035
- Let's go with "Hyung." - We have to say it in English.

2171
01:18:19,036 --> 01:18:20,296
- Hyung. - Hyung.

2172
01:18:20,297 --> 01:18:21,605
What's "Hyung?"

2173
01:18:21,606 --> 01:18:23,236
(What's "Hyung?")

2174
01:18:23,536 --> 01:18:26,106
"Hyung" is difficult to pronounce.

2175
01:18:26,707 --> 01:18:27,877
Noraebang.

2176
01:18:28,677 --> 01:18:30,207
Dalgona.

2177
01:18:30,307 --> 01:18:31,517
Samgyetang.

2178
01:18:32,217 --> 01:18:33,417
Hyung.

2179
01:18:33,746 --> 01:18:34,985
Stop it!

2180
01:18:34,986 --> 01:18:37,446
(He runs out of patience.)

2181
01:18:37,816 --> 01:18:39,386
Let me go home.

2182
01:18:39,387 --> 01:18:41,386
(Yu Rim-ping wants to go home.)

2183
01:18:41,387 --> 01:18:42,727
Okay. Here we go.

2184
01:18:43,286 --> 01:18:44,326
Our answer is...

2185
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:48,666
"Hyung."

2186
01:18:48,667 --> 01:18:50,726
(Hyung)

2187
01:18:50,727 --> 01:18:51,866
Incorrect.

2188
01:18:52,696 --> 01:18:55,435
(Team Handsome fails to complete a bingo.)

2189
01:18:55,436 --> 01:18:57,507
- What's the answer? - The answer is...

2190
01:18:58,337 --> 01:18:59,637
"Samgyetang."

2191
01:18:59,707 --> 01:19:01,245
(Annoyed)

2192
01:19:01,246 --> 01:19:02,575
I feel less victimized.

2193
01:19:02,576 --> 01:19:04,376
Words that are related to K-contents...

2194
01:19:04,377 --> 01:19:06,177
- get added here. - What I said was correct.

2195
01:19:06,717 --> 01:19:08,387
What I said was correct.

2196
01:19:08,446 --> 01:19:09,546
- That's right. - What contents exist...

2197
01:19:09,547 --> 01:19:10,686
for samgyetang?

2198
01:19:10,986 --> 01:19:13,486
- That's right. - You said that earlier.

2199
01:19:14,217 --> 01:19:15,926
Which two people voted for "Hyung?"

2200
01:19:15,927 --> 01:19:18,056
Three people voted for "Hyung."

2201
01:19:18,057 --> 01:19:20,257
There were four.

2202
01:19:20,326 --> 01:19:22,565
Thank goodness we came here.

2203
01:19:22,566 --> 01:19:24,766
- Did you enjoy the meal? - It was so tasty.

2204
01:19:24,767 --> 01:19:26,467
- Are we done? - No.

2205
01:19:26,536 --> 01:19:27,836
You should film more.

2206
01:19:27,837 --> 01:19:29,166
(You should film more.)

2207
01:19:29,167 --> 01:19:31,405
- We need to solve a quiz. - Do you need to solve a quiz?

2208
01:19:31,406 --> 01:19:33,506
Why don't you solve it with us?

2209
01:19:33,507 --> 01:19:35,645
If the other team gets it right,

2210
01:19:35,646 --> 01:19:37,306
we'll lose.

2211
01:19:37,307 --> 01:19:39,676
We need to get it right no matter what...

2212
01:19:39,677 --> 01:19:42,615
- so that it'll be a tie. - It's 3 to 2.

2213
01:19:42,616 --> 01:19:44,785
You'll be a hero if you get it right.

2214
01:19:44,786 --> 01:19:47,156
Let's say you get it right.

2215
01:19:47,826 --> 01:19:49,386
- A buzzer-beater. - Then...

2216
01:19:49,387 --> 01:19:51,196
Here comes the last quiz.

2217
01:19:51,427 --> 01:19:53,627
- Did you enjoy the ramyeon? - yes.

2218
01:19:53,727 --> 01:19:55,467
Among the following,

2219
01:19:55,866 --> 01:19:59,297
which one isn't an advertising slogan for ramyeon?

2220
01:19:59,467 --> 01:20:00,707
- An advertising slogan? - Yes.

2221
01:20:01,307 --> 01:20:02,666
What's that?

2222
01:20:02,667 --> 01:20:04,307
"What's that?"

2223
01:20:04,707 --> 01:20:06,035
- An advertising slogan? - Are you serious?

2224
01:20:06,036 --> 01:20:07,706
I don't understand the question.

2225
01:20:07,707 --> 01:20:10,046
Control and C, Control and V. Copy and paste.

2226
01:20:10,047 --> 01:20:11,917
- Is that it? - Yes.

2227
01:20:12,646 --> 01:20:14,075
What is he talking about?

2228
01:20:14,076 --> 01:20:16,815
At the end of the commercial, you get an impactful sentence.

2229
01:20:16,816 --> 01:20:18,216
Dong Hyun.

2230
01:20:18,217 --> 01:20:20,516
- I mean... - My goodness.

2231
01:20:20,517 --> 01:20:23,456
- They're on the same level. - I needed to understand...

2232
01:20:23,457 --> 01:20:25,757
- in order to answer correctly. - He's so charming.

2233
01:20:26,297 --> 01:20:27,496
"What's that?"

2234
01:20:28,366 --> 01:20:29,796
You got it wrong too.

2235
01:20:29,797 --> 01:20:32,935
I didn't know how the word was used.

2236
01:20:32,936 --> 01:20:35,035
- Okay. Copy that. - You know what it is now.

2237
01:20:35,036 --> 01:20:37,506
- Yes. - Here come the examples.

2238
01:20:37,507 --> 01:20:40,406
Number one, "Older brother 1st, younger brother 1st."

2239
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:44,276
Number two, "Thank you for being tasty."

2240
01:20:44,477 --> 01:20:45,776
This is...

2241
01:20:45,877 --> 01:20:46,976
Number three,

2242
01:20:46,977 --> 01:20:48,986
"Eat only if you're confident."

2243
01:20:50,116 --> 01:20:52,316
Number four, "You're mine."

2244
01:20:52,616 --> 01:20:54,556
- Among them... - This is hard.

2245
01:20:54,557 --> 01:20:55,956
Were 3 out of 4 used...

2246
01:20:55,957 --> 01:20:57,797
- in a ramyeon commercial? - Yes.

2247
01:20:57,826 --> 01:20:59,226
- I haven't heard any one of them. - No.

2248
01:20:59,227 --> 01:21:00,296
It definitely isn't number one.

2249
01:21:00,297 --> 01:21:01,695
- It isn't number one. - Number 1.

2250
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:03,766
"Older brother 1st, younger brother 1st."

2251
01:21:03,767 --> 01:21:04,866
Really?

2252
01:21:05,097 --> 01:21:07,336
- "Older brother first..." - I remember them...

2253
01:21:07,337 --> 01:21:09,536
giving the bowl back and forth.

2254
01:21:09,606 --> 01:21:12,575
Every time, the question has a trap.

2255
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:15,446
"You're mine" seems to be out of place, but...

2256
01:21:15,547 --> 01:21:18,016
I think it'll appear in a beer commercial. "You're mine."

2257
01:21:18,017 --> 01:21:19,876
"Eat only if you're confident."

2258
01:21:19,877 --> 01:21:22,886
I think it's for spicy ramyeon.

2259
01:21:22,887 --> 01:21:24,786
"Thank you for being tasty." Isn't that...

2260
01:21:25,316 --> 01:21:27,257
what you see in front of a restaurant?

2261
01:21:27,517 --> 01:21:28,856
By the way,

2262
01:21:29,387 --> 01:21:32,155
am I the one who's answering?

2263
01:21:32,156 --> 01:21:33,716
- No, we're doing it together. - I see.

2264
01:21:34,297 --> 01:21:36,596
- We need to discuss it. - I see.

2265
01:21:36,597 --> 01:21:39,137
So I don't have the special rights.

2266
01:21:39,236 --> 01:21:40,266
We're a team.

2267
01:21:40,267 --> 01:21:42,667
- You're just another brain. - Is that so?

2268
01:21:43,207 --> 01:21:44,807
My head is so cold.

2269
01:21:45,137 --> 01:21:46,476
I think it froze.

2270
01:21:46,477 --> 01:21:48,177
You only have one chance.

2271
01:21:48,776 --> 01:21:49,847
Thank you.

2272
01:21:49,877 --> 01:21:51,476
It's so warm.

2273
01:21:51,477 --> 01:21:52,716
(It's so warm.)

2274
01:21:52,717 --> 01:21:54,115
It's so warm.

2275
01:21:54,116 --> 01:21:55,185
I get cold since my head is shaved.

2276
01:21:55,186 --> 01:21:57,745
An MMA fighter had that hairstyle. His name is Chuck Liddell.

2277
01:21:57,746 --> 01:21:59,086
He had hair in the middle.

2278
01:21:59,087 --> 01:22:00,767
You look like Chuck Liddell from the side.

2279
01:22:01,457 --> 01:22:02,887
Show your side profile.

2280
01:22:03,757 --> 01:22:05,155
- You look the same. - Really?

2281
01:22:05,156 --> 01:22:06,495
- Chuck Liddell. - Really?

2282
01:22:06,496 --> 01:22:09,296
I think "You're mine" is for an alcoholic drink.

2283
01:22:09,297 --> 01:22:10,565
There's that vibe.

2284
01:22:10,566 --> 01:22:12,797
"You're mine!" I think that's the vibe.

2285
01:22:12,866 --> 01:22:14,666
"You're mine" feels like a trap.

2286
01:22:14,667 --> 01:22:16,787
- "Thank you for being tasty?" - I choose number two.

2287
01:22:16,837 --> 01:22:17,876
"Thank you for being tasty?"

2288
01:22:17,877 --> 01:22:19,576
Could it be for seolleongtang?

2289
01:22:19,837 --> 01:22:21,445
- We have to decide now. - During these moments,

2290
01:22:21,446 --> 01:22:23,547
who is the one to decide? Do you make the decisions?

2291
01:22:23,776 --> 01:22:25,876
Everyone is hesitant because we keep getting it wrong.

2292
01:22:25,877 --> 01:22:27,115
(Tae Hyun will be the one to decide.)

2293
01:22:27,116 --> 01:22:29,816
Sang Uk did well at the start today.

2294
01:22:30,186 --> 01:22:31,756
- It's number four for me. - Okay.

2295
01:22:31,757 --> 01:22:34,525
Saying, "You're mine,"

2296
01:22:34,526 --> 01:22:36,855
after carrying a packet of ramyeon. I can imagine that.

2297
01:22:36,856 --> 01:22:38,632
So it's "Thank you for being tasty," for you?

2298
01:22:38,656 --> 01:22:39,726
- "Thank you for being tasty." - I think it's this one.

2299
01:22:39,727 --> 01:22:41,326
What is being thanked for?

2300
01:22:41,767 --> 01:22:42,826
Is it the ramyeon?

2301
01:22:43,927 --> 01:22:45,137
"Thank you for being tasty."

2302
01:22:45,467 --> 01:22:48,007
Think about how it would feel as a commercial.

2303
01:22:48,566 --> 01:22:50,536
- "You're mine." - It's number four for me.

2304
01:22:50,736 --> 01:22:51,876
"You're mine."

2305
01:22:51,877 --> 01:22:53,676
- "Thank you for being tasty." - Decide for us, Tae Hyun.

2306
01:22:53,677 --> 01:22:55,077
- Decide for us, Tae Hyun. - Right.

2307
01:22:55,347 --> 01:22:57,153
I'm done with making up my mind. It's number four for me.

2308
01:22:57,177 --> 01:22:58,216
"You're mine."

2309
01:22:58,217 --> 01:22:59,217
"I'll buy a lot of them to enjoy at home."

2310
01:22:59,217 --> 01:23:00,217
This is what it feels like.

2311
01:23:00,218 --> 01:23:01,816
After enjoying it like this...

2312
01:23:02,186 --> 01:23:03,445
"Thank you for being tasty."

2313
01:23:03,446 --> 01:23:04,587
I think this was the line.

2314
01:23:04,816 --> 01:23:06,217
I'm not sure.

2315
01:23:06,387 --> 01:23:07,387
This is the answer!

2316
01:23:07,388 --> 01:23:09,302
(They must get it right to make the scores tied.)

2317
01:23:09,326 --> 01:23:10,656
Number four, "You're mine."

2318
01:23:11,427 --> 01:23:12,427
Number four.

2319
01:23:12,896 --> 01:23:14,826
Really? Please be right.

2320
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:17,127
- Number four. - I don't know anymore.

2321
01:23:17,326 --> 01:23:18,565
- Number four! - The one that...

2322
01:23:18,566 --> 01:23:19,836
isn't the slogan for the ramyeon commercial.

2323
01:23:19,837 --> 01:23:20,935
This doesn't sound right.

2324
01:23:20,936 --> 01:23:22,605
- Number four. - Please be right this time.

2325
01:23:22,606 --> 01:23:23,636
"You're mine."

2326
01:23:23,637 --> 01:23:26,575
(Sang Uk's choice was selected.)

2327
01:23:26,576 --> 01:23:29,745
(Number 4, "You're mine.")

2328
01:23:29,746 --> 01:23:30,746
Incorrect!

2329
01:23:33,017 --> 01:23:34,217
It isn't number two, is it?

2330
01:23:34,646 --> 01:23:35,816
Is it really number two?

2331
01:23:36,547 --> 01:23:37,815
- Hold on! - The answer.

2332
01:23:37,816 --> 01:23:39,662
- It must be number one. - That would feel better.

2333
01:23:39,686 --> 01:23:41,325
It's number two, "Thank you for being tasty."

2334
01:23:41,326 --> 01:23:42,926
(Number 2, "Thank you for being tasty.")

2335
01:23:42,927 --> 01:23:44,056
I'm sorry. Gosh.

2336
01:23:44,057 --> 01:23:45,096
(Collapsing)

2337
01:23:45,097 --> 01:23:46,396
I'm really sorry.

2338
01:23:46,597 --> 01:23:47,896
Are you feeling mad?

2339
01:23:48,597 --> 01:23:50,627
What was "Thank you for being tasty?" for then?

2340
01:23:50,967 --> 01:23:52,796
"Thank you for being tasty,"

2341
01:23:52,797 --> 01:23:54,412
was a commercial filmed by Kang Ho Dong...

2342
01:23:54,436 --> 01:23:56,307
for a milk product.

2343
01:23:57,667 --> 01:23:59,807
Right. Milk isn't known for its taste.

2344
01:23:59,936 --> 01:24:01,476
- "It's tasty..." - Right.

2345
01:24:01,477 --> 01:24:03,377
"even though no special taste was expected."

2346
01:24:04,746 --> 01:24:07,076
- Gosh. - "You're mine."

2347
01:24:07,446 --> 01:24:09,416
This one the line said by Fin.K.L...

2348
01:24:09,417 --> 01:24:10,746
for a ramyeon commercial.

2349
01:24:11,217 --> 01:24:14,155
(A catchphrase made from the lyrics of "To My Boyfriend")

2350
01:24:14,156 --> 01:24:15,185
I see.

2351
01:24:15,186 --> 01:24:17,386
They were lyrics of a song?

2352
01:24:17,387 --> 01:24:19,227
- Right. - "I'm yours."

2353
01:24:19,696 --> 01:24:20,855
I wasn't from that generation.

2354
01:24:20,856 --> 01:24:22,267
It was really popular.

2355
01:24:22,396 --> 01:24:23,396
Team Guys,

2356
01:24:23,397 --> 01:24:24,466
(Team Guys loses after getting it wrong.)

2357
01:24:24,467 --> 01:24:26,636
you have lost this round of the bingo game.

2358
01:24:26,637 --> 01:24:27,637
Right.

2359
01:24:27,638 --> 01:24:28,807
- Hey, - We lost.

2360
01:24:29,137 --> 01:24:31,137
- tell the others to celebrate. - Right.

2361
01:24:32,776 --> 01:24:34,605
(Team Handsome takes the win.)

2362
01:24:34,606 --> 01:24:35,646
We won!

2363
01:24:36,047 --> 01:24:37,806
It would've been great if we were told earlier.

2364
01:24:37,807 --> 01:24:39,616
I knew we were going to win.

2365
01:24:40,847 --> 01:24:41,917
Great work.

2366
01:24:42,246 --> 01:24:44,217
We weren't able to complete the bingo.

2367
01:24:44,587 --> 01:24:46,716
It was great to work with Kyung Ho though.

2368
01:24:46,717 --> 01:24:47,717
Thank you.

2369
01:24:47,718 --> 01:24:50,456
I've experienced my first win!

2370
01:24:50,457 --> 01:24:51,526
We did it!

2371
01:24:51,957 --> 01:24:53,296
That team must feel disappointed.

2372
01:24:53,297 --> 01:24:55,266
(Singing the Handsome Guys jingle on repeat...)

2373
01:24:55,267 --> 01:24:57,826
(whether they are happy or sad)

2374
01:24:58,467 --> 01:25:01,336
(Oh, Handsome Guys)

2375
01:25:01,337 --> 01:25:02,337
(We are!)

2376
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:07,075
(Team Handsome gets off work with the sweet jingle.)

2377
01:25:07,076 --> 01:25:08,745
Thank you so much for today.

2378
01:25:08,746 --> 01:25:10,245
Dong Hyun and Sang Uk too.

2379
01:25:10,246 --> 01:25:11,445
Thank you.

2380
01:25:11,446 --> 01:25:13,917
Dear viewers, I'll see you again next week...

2381
01:25:15,286 --> 01:25:18,116
as a different person.

2382
01:25:18,686 --> 01:25:20,985
- Happy New Year. - Gosh.

2383
01:25:20,986 --> 01:25:23,757
The last game will be done with these three...

2384
01:25:23,887 --> 01:25:25,126
- and we will call it a day. - Okay.

2385
01:25:25,127 --> 01:25:26,695
- It's just one person, right? - Yes.

2386
01:25:26,696 --> 01:25:28,565
It's the first loss for me and Tae Hyun.

2387
01:25:28,566 --> 01:25:29,966
It's my first loss...

2388
01:25:29,967 --> 01:25:32,266
and it'll be my first penalty if I lose.

2389
01:25:32,267 --> 01:25:33,836
It's fine for the two of us.

2390
01:25:33,837 --> 01:25:35,035
If Sang Uk loses here,

2391
01:25:35,036 --> 01:25:36,466
it'll be his third penalty in a row.

2392
01:25:36,467 --> 01:25:38,076
- Here's the question. - Right.

2393
01:25:38,536 --> 01:25:39,605
On YouTube,

2394
01:25:39,606 --> 01:25:41,775
the term "LCSN" is used often.

2395
01:25:41,776 --> 01:25:43,047
It's short for "like, comment,"

2396
01:25:43,246 --> 01:25:45,445
'subscribe, and notifications"

2397
01:25:45,446 --> 01:25:47,115
- I knew that one. - I don't know these things.

2398
01:25:47,116 --> 01:25:50,315
Then what is "AS" short for?

2399
01:25:50,316 --> 01:25:51,316
"AS?"

2400
01:25:51,316 --> 01:25:52,316
"AS."

2401
01:25:52,317 --> 01:25:53,387
"AS?"

2402
01:25:53,656 --> 01:25:54,686
"AS?"

2403
01:25:55,356 --> 01:25:57,155
It's used on YouTube.

2404
01:25:57,156 --> 01:25:58,156
"AS."

2405
01:25:58,757 --> 01:26:00,197
- Me! I'll try to guess it. - Right.

2406
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,627
A temporary subscription?

2407
01:26:03,967 --> 01:26:06,047
- "A temporary subscription?" - It's just temporary.

2408
01:26:06,797 --> 01:26:08,443
It's subscribing to a channel temporarily.

2409
01:26:08,467 --> 01:26:09,535
Is it cancelling the subscription?

2410
01:26:09,536 --> 01:26:11,137
- I think that's right. - The S...

2411
01:26:11,837 --> 01:26:13,837
The S on YouTube is always "subscribe."

2412
01:26:15,047 --> 01:26:17,007
- That must be right then. - That is incorrect.

2413
01:26:17,146 --> 01:26:18,146
- It's incorrect? - That wasn't it.

2414
01:26:18,147 --> 01:26:19,315
S isn't "subscribe?"

2415
01:26:19,316 --> 01:26:20,445
There's a big chance it is "subscribe."

2416
01:26:20,446 --> 01:26:21,446
- Really? - Yes.

2417
01:26:21,446 --> 01:26:22,446
"A?"

2418
01:26:23,786 --> 01:26:25,506
I'll go. Asking for a subscription partner.

2419
01:26:25,616 --> 01:26:27,986
"Asking for a subscription partner?" What?

2420
01:26:28,427 --> 01:26:29,825
(Laughing)

2421
01:26:29,826 --> 01:26:32,257
- I couldn't think of anything. - There he goes again.

2422
01:26:33,597 --> 01:26:34,656
Incorrect.

2423
01:26:35,127 --> 01:26:36,196
"A?"

2424
01:26:36,866 --> 01:26:38,366
What could "A" be?

2425
01:26:39,196 --> 01:26:40,836
I've been on YouTube for a while, but I've never heard of this one.

2426
01:26:40,837 --> 01:26:42,236
I'll go! Asking for staff members.

2427
01:26:42,467 --> 01:26:44,307
"Asking for staff members." That is incorrect.

2428
01:26:44,337 --> 01:26:46,207
That was the first thing I thought of.

2429
01:26:46,776 --> 01:26:47,876
- I'll go. - Okay.

2430
01:26:47,877 --> 01:26:48,977
"Already subscribed."

2431
01:26:49,146 --> 01:26:50,745
- It's "AS." - Right.

2432
01:26:50,746 --> 01:26:52,017
- "AS." - "Already subscribed."

2433
01:26:52,347 --> 01:26:53,376
That is correct!

2434
01:26:53,377 --> 01:26:55,017
(Already subscribed)

2435
01:26:56,087 --> 01:27:00,087
(Dong Hyun gets it right.)

2436
01:27:01,017 --> 01:27:02,257
I just guessed.

2437
01:27:02,786 --> 01:27:04,025
"Already subscribed..."

2438
01:27:04,026 --> 01:27:05,296
- is shortened to "AS?" - Yes.

2439
01:27:05,297 --> 01:27:06,355
I'm sorry.

2440
01:27:06,356 --> 01:27:08,366
You're a genius!

2441
01:27:09,196 --> 01:27:10,927
- You're amazing. - I'm sorry.

2442
01:27:11,167 --> 01:27:12,495
I had no idea that could be it.

2443
01:27:12,496 --> 01:27:14,495
"A temporary subscription" was a good guess too.

2444
01:27:14,496 --> 01:27:15,507
Right.

2445
01:27:16,236 --> 01:27:17,236
My gosh.

2446
01:27:17,237 --> 01:27:18,775
This is reminding me of the previous shoot.

2447
01:27:18,776 --> 01:27:20,676
(Sang Uk is feeling thirsty.)

2448
01:27:20,677 --> 01:27:21,677
You're chugging the water.

2449
01:27:21,678 --> 01:27:24,876
(These two were left for the previous penalty quiz.)

2450
01:27:24,877 --> 01:27:28,416
(Tae Hyun got the answer right with coffee mix...)

2451
01:27:28,417 --> 01:27:31,615
(and Sang Uk had to go through the penalty.)

2452
01:27:31,616 --> 01:27:32,655
(Will Sang Uk be able to get his revenge?)

2453
01:27:32,656 --> 01:27:34,217
Here's the next question.

2454
01:27:34,757 --> 01:27:35,886
The "powder room..."

2455
01:27:35,887 --> 01:27:38,195
is a place where you doll yourself up.

2456
01:27:38,196 --> 01:27:40,526
- "Powder room?" - The origin of "powder room..."

2457
01:27:40,696 --> 01:27:43,927
comes from the room to spread flour on "this..."

2458
01:27:44,227 --> 01:27:49,007
used by European nobles.

2459
01:27:49,736 --> 01:27:50,905
What is "this?"

2460
01:27:50,906 --> 01:27:52,036
- In the past? - Yes.

2461
01:27:52,236 --> 01:27:54,206
- The nobles used this room? - It was spread on "this?"

2462
01:27:54,207 --> 01:27:55,576
Flour was spread on "this?"

2463
01:27:55,746 --> 01:27:57,446
- "Powder room." - I'll go. The dress.

2464
01:27:57,776 --> 01:27:59,146
What? The dress?

2465
01:27:59,816 --> 01:28:00,917
That is incorrect.

2466
01:28:01,477 --> 01:28:04,146
Flour was spread on "this."

2467
01:28:04,746 --> 01:28:05,856
I'll go. The comb?

2468
01:28:06,587 --> 01:28:07,587
"Comb."

2469
01:28:07,588 --> 01:28:08,655
(Comb)

2470
01:28:08,656 --> 01:28:10,326
- "This." - That is incorrect.

2471
01:28:12,026 --> 01:28:13,495
Flour was spread on "this?"

2472
01:28:13,496 --> 01:28:14,856
Why was flour spread on "this?"

2473
01:28:15,526 --> 01:28:17,467
It's an item that is still used today.

2474
01:28:18,066 --> 01:28:20,496
I'll go. The hat.

2475
01:28:21,036 --> 01:28:22,565
It's the hat.

2476
01:28:22,566 --> 01:28:23,706
(Hat)

2477
01:28:23,707 --> 01:28:24,736
That is incorrect.

2478
01:28:25,236 --> 01:28:26,436
I'll go. The moustache.

2479
01:28:27,576 --> 01:28:28,746
- Gosh. - "Moustache."

2480
01:28:29,507 --> 01:28:31,246
- That is incorrect. - It's an item.

2481
01:28:31,917 --> 01:28:33,546
What would flour be spread on?

2482
01:28:33,547 --> 01:28:35,517
They were nobles.

2483
01:28:36,517 --> 01:28:37,716
- I'll go. - Sang Uk.

2484
01:28:37,717 --> 01:28:38,717
Well...

2485
01:28:39,616 --> 01:28:42,155
What are those called? The things that are like brushes.

2486
01:28:42,156 --> 01:28:43,456
- What are those? - Say things that are like brushes.

2487
01:28:43,457 --> 01:28:44,626
Things that are like brushes.

2488
01:28:44,627 --> 01:28:45,695
(Things that are like brushes)

2489
01:28:45,696 --> 01:28:48,097
- "Brush" is incorrect. - What are those?

2490
01:28:48,326 --> 01:28:49,797
It can't be the hair though.

2491
01:28:50,496 --> 01:28:52,365
I know! The wig?

2492
01:28:52,366 --> 01:28:57,565
(Wig)

2493
01:28:57,566 --> 01:28:59,575
Hold on!

2494
01:28:59,576 --> 01:29:01,946
- It's the wig? - Hold on! This can't be right!

2495
01:29:02,146 --> 01:29:04,145
- Hold on. - I haven't announced it yet.

2496
01:29:04,146 --> 01:29:05,216
I haven't announced it yet.

2497
01:29:05,217 --> 01:29:06,815
He didn't announce it yet.

2498
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:09,146
The nobles used a lot of wigs.

2499
01:29:09,246 --> 01:29:12,216
If you think about it, they had a lot of white hair.

2500
01:29:12,217 --> 01:29:13,655
(A temple in Chungcheong Province and a mountain in Seoul)

2501
01:29:13,656 --> 01:29:15,227
Hurry up and take the answer.

2502
01:29:15,427 --> 01:29:17,326
This is hurting my pride so much.

2503
01:29:17,486 --> 01:29:19,025
I do want to steal the answer.

2504
01:29:19,026 --> 01:29:20,096
(A national fencing player must be fair.)

2505
01:29:20,097 --> 01:29:21,126
A fencing player...

2506
01:29:21,127 --> 01:29:22,797
- can't be like that. - It must be right.

2507
01:29:23,396 --> 01:29:25,696
- It's a gentleman's sport. - It must be the wig.

2508
01:29:25,996 --> 01:29:27,036
Correct!

2509
01:29:28,837 --> 01:29:30,106
This one was really hard.

2510
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:32,506
- It was the wig? - Yes.

2511
01:29:32,507 --> 01:29:34,235
It's the first thing that comes to mind when nobles are mentioned.

2512
01:29:34,236 --> 01:29:35,376
- Right. - Right.

2513
01:29:35,377 --> 01:29:37,606
They all had white hair like this.

2514
01:29:37,807 --> 01:29:40,146
- Gosh, Sang Uk. - My gosh.

2515
01:29:40,616 --> 01:29:42,116
This question was really hard.

2516
01:29:42,547 --> 01:29:44,086
(He got all of the questions wrong toward the end of the race.)

2517
01:29:44,087 --> 01:29:46,087
It should've been the question earlier.

2518
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:48,655
For three times in a row.

2519
01:29:48,656 --> 01:29:49,756
(A big record of going through the penalty for 3 times in a row)

2520
01:29:49,757 --> 01:29:50,757
It's your third time in a row?

2521
01:29:50,758 --> 01:29:52,326
- Yes. - Yes.

2522
01:29:54,057 --> 01:29:56,366
Sang Uk will be the one to go.

2523
01:29:56,826 --> 01:29:58,395
Great work today.

2524
01:29:58,396 --> 01:29:59,836
Thank you.

2525
01:29:59,837 --> 01:30:03,336
(Sang Uk's insect catching will be revealed online.)

2526
01:30:03,337 --> 01:30:05,736
The viewers would have felt so frustrated.

2527
01:30:06,744 --> 01:30:08,713
(Today's guest is Jang Hyuk?)

2528
01:30:08,954 --> 01:30:12,583
(Jang Hyuk came as a member instead of his best friend Tae Hyun.)

2529
01:30:12,854 --> 01:30:14,052
(It's my first time seeing Yi Kyung.)

2530
01:30:14,053 --> 01:30:15,124
(We've seen each other!)

2531
01:30:15,624 --> 01:30:17,193
(Where did we see each other?)

2532
01:30:17,194 --> 01:30:19,423
(Will he be able to be a good fill-in member?)

2533
01:30:19,824 --> 01:30:21,863
(Today's real guest, John Park)

2534
01:30:21,864 --> 01:30:23,494
(Sang Uk contacted me.)

2535
01:30:23,593 --> 01:30:25,864
(The charming man that is sweet to everyone)

2536
01:30:26,133 --> 01:30:27,663
(What is today's Handsome Heritage?)

2537
01:30:27,664 --> 01:30:32,374
(Bakery tour in North Jeolla Province)

2538
01:30:32,704 --> 01:30:35,773
(The sweet temptation of bread)

2539
01:30:35,774 --> 01:30:37,243
(We can have what we want, right?)

2540
01:30:37,244 --> 01:30:40,283
(The eaters are going wild.)

2541
01:30:40,284 --> 01:30:42,212
(They can eat anything.)

2542
01:30:42,213 --> 01:30:45,182
(They are 500 percent satisfied with the race.)

2543
01:30:45,183 --> 01:30:47,103
(My worries disappear with a bite of the bread.)

2544
01:30:47,154 --> 01:30:49,922
(Enjoying the different flavours in a relaxed manner)

2545
01:30:49,923 --> 01:30:52,024
(But when will we get the questions?)

2546
01:30:52,364 --> 01:30:54,563
(It's time to get the bingo after eating the bread.)

2547
01:30:54,564 --> 01:30:55,994
(I've got a great hunch today!)

2548
01:30:56,364 --> 01:30:58,393
(Hyuk trusts his senses.)

2549
01:30:58,704 --> 01:30:59,932
(Let's do this!)

2550
01:30:59,933 --> 01:31:01,904
(John uses his brain to set up strategies.)

2551
01:31:02,704 --> 01:31:03,774
(That was a great idea.)

2552
01:31:04,574 --> 01:31:05,774
(We'll move without thinking.)

2553
01:31:05,843 --> 01:31:07,373
(The battle of senses against brains)

2554
01:31:07,374 --> 01:31:08,712
(The battle of brains against senses)

2555
01:31:08,713 --> 01:31:12,914
(Which team will smile at the end of the race?)

2556
01:31:13,213 --> 01:31:18,883
("Baby It's You" by Junjin featuring Greg Priester)
