1
00:00:30,179 --> 00:00:31,810
What's the name of our show?

2
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,379
- I don't know.
- I don't know either.

3
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:34,910
What kind of show is it?

4
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:36,380
I wasn't informed at all.

5
00:00:37,249 --> 00:00:38,919
I just know that Ho Jin is the director.

6
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:41,089
I know that it's a new TV show.

7
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,749
(A new variety show on tvN to entertain you on Sunday evening)

8
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,189
(We will introduce it now.)

9
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:50,899
(One morning at the end of October in Busan)

10
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,298
We're in Busan at 7am.

11
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:55,570
(Cha Tae Hyun)

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,238
What are we doing?

13
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,838
(Kim Dong Hyun)

14
00:00:59,839 --> 00:01:02,308
Calling us to Busan at 7am is...

15
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:03,978
very old-fashioned.

16
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:06,110
- Is it?
- People don't do this anymore.

17
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,710
Hello.

18
00:01:08,879 --> 00:01:11,048
Hello.

19
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:12,419
Someone young is here.

20
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:14,389
Right. Nice to meet you.

21
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,750
- Someone young.
- I'm your fan.

22
00:01:16,189 --> 00:01:17,559
- Someone young.
- I'm your fan.

23
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:20,189
- He's very tall.
- Right?

24
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:23,089
I'm Oh Sang Uk on the national fencing team.

25
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,400
- Seriously.
- Goodness.

26
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:29,700
(2024 Paris Summer Games)

27
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:32,640
(Gold medalist, twice in a row in fencing)

28
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,709
(Handsome swordsman in fencing, Oh Sang Uk)

29
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:39,610
- He's really tall.
- Right.

30
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,509
Dong Hyun, compared to him...

31
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:43,649
I'm also tall.

32
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:46,579
People usually tell me that I'm tall.

33
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,288
- That's amazing.
- He's really taller.

34
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:50,119
You have a strong physique.

35
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,719
You're very tall. You must weigh...

36
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,060
Another tall person arrived.

37
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,090
- Hello.
- He's tall too.

38
00:01:56,230 --> 00:01:57,529
- Hello.
- Hi.

39
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,159
What kind of show is this?

40
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:02,268
- Is it...
- It must be a sports show.

41
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:04,298
- Is it aiming...
- He's really tall.

42
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:07,369
For the Summer Games in four years?

43
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,909
- I know.
- What's going on here?

44
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,010
This is unbelievable. This is Seung Ho.

45
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:17,379
Hello.

46
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,620
(How cute)

47
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:21,849
I'm Actor Shin Seung Ho.

48
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,760
(He became known for playing Sergeant Hwang Jang Soo in "D.P.")

49
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,830
(He played Go Won in "Alchemy of Souls" with unexpected charms.)

50
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,239
(Handsome macho in movies, Shin Seung Ho)

51
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:40,769
You'll be singing on this show.

52
00:02:42,709 --> 00:02:44,839
- Sing?
- You'll dance and sing.

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,278
(He's a new recruit on variety shows.)

54
00:02:46,279 --> 00:02:48,678
Anyway, you won't be acting here.

55
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,820
- Right.
- Everything except acting.

56
00:02:51,179 --> 00:02:53,079
That's true.

57
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,820
Goodness.

58
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:57,018
- Hey.
- He's an entertainer.

59
00:02:57,019 --> 00:02:58,759
The first entertainer arrived.

60
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,659
- Finally.
- He's old but pretends to be young.

61
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,789
Hello.

62
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,529
- The first entertainer arrived.
- I told you about him.

63
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,799
Are you on your offseason?

64
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:09,028
Are you on your offseason?

65
00:03:09,029 --> 00:03:10,499
(Chubby)

66
00:03:10,769 --> 00:03:12,670
He should keep fencing.

67
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:14,509
- The entertainer.
- Goodness.

68
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,939
There are no fencing competitions these days,

69
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,979
right?

70
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:19,439
I just finished a big competition,

71
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,149
so I thought of taking a break this year.

72
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,320
He looks chubbier...

73
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,480
than I expected.

74
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:28,019
It's just his baby fat.

75
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:31,389
- He looks good.
- Sang Uk is our youngest.

76
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:32,919
- That's true.
- So it's his baby fat.

77
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,189
The youngest is the tallest.

78
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,190
(Sucking in his cheeks)

79
00:03:35,191 --> 00:03:36,589
Come here, Sang Uk.

80
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,798
Did I gain that much weight?

81
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:39,199
By the way,

82
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,699
what is our show called?

83
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,798
- I don't know.
- I don't know either.

84
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:43,199
I'll ask my questions later.

85
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,238
- Do you know, Sang Uk?
- I'm not sure.

86
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:46,499
No one knows about it.

87
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:49,910
We decided the name of our show...

88
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,338
the day before yesterday.

89
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:53,480
The day before yesterday? What is it?

90
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,579
(What's the name of our show?)

91
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,749
The name will be...

92
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,218
Handsome Guys.

93
00:04:00,219 --> 00:04:03,089
(We're Handsome Guys.)

94
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:05,889
- "Handsome Guys?" - Wait.

95
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:07,159
(Handsome Guys?)

96
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,860
- "Handsome Guys?" - Wait, Dong Hyun.

97
00:04:09,089 --> 00:04:11,298
- Let's leave.
- Hey.

98
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:12,659
- Still, you're an actor.
- I'm in the wrong place.

99
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,229
- I'm in the wrong place.
- Handsome Guys.

100
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,599
But you're an actor.

101
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,600
You can stay.

102
00:04:16,601 --> 00:04:17,768
I'm really sorry.

103
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:18,838
Dong Hyun isn't part of it, right?

104
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,338
Dong Hyun, come here for now.

105
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,838
Tae Hyun has gotten old now.

106
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:24,139
- Both of us...
- Right.

107
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,678
Most people don't say that I'm handsome.

108
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:26,708
"Handsome Guys?"

109
00:04:26,709 --> 00:04:28,009
Stay a little longer.

110
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,509
Is it really true?

111
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,619
Is it "Handsome Guys?"

112
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:33,019
Seung Ho asked me,

113
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:34,719
"Is it really true?"

114
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,018
(He didn't want to believe it.)

115
00:04:36,019 --> 00:04:37,360
"Is it really 'Handsome Guys?'"

116
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:40,690
Has the name been decided as "Handsome Guys?"

117
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,158
My goodness.

118
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:46,200
The four of you can talk about being on the show.

119
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:48,429
If someone asks me, "Which show are you on now?"

120
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,899
"I'm on Handsome Guys."

121
00:04:50,769 --> 00:04:53,909
"You? What's your role on the show?"

122
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,739
With five of you who are very handsome to us,

123
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,639
we'll start the show for the first time.

124
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,309
We also invited a guest.

125
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:04,320
Our guest has to be handsome.

126
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,649
Please come out.

127
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:10,718
- He looks handsome from afar.
- Right.

128
00:05:10,719 --> 00:05:11,958
- Even from afar.
- That's a relief.

129
00:05:11,959 --> 00:05:13,089
We're just guys.

130
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:15,489
- We are simply guys.
- Is that what we are?

131
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:16,889
We have a handsome guest every week.

132
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:17,959
That makes sense.

133
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,929
He's considered a handsome guy.

134
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:20,999
Jin.

135
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
(Today's first guest to fulfill the handsome role)

136
00:05:22,899 --> 00:05:23,899
Goodness.

137
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:26,899
(BTS, the best global artist)

138
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,010
(A handsome member recognized by the world)

139
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,379
My face is...

140
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:39,919
(Worldwide handsome BTS)

141
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,449
- Have you been well?
- Of course.

142
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,788
- I've been well.
- Hello.

143
00:05:42,789 --> 00:05:43,990
Hello.

144
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:45,889
- He's here.
- Hello.

145
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,289
Hello.

146
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,489
- Goodness.
- Hello.

147
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,499
- We've met before.
- Hello.

148
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,159
- He's handsome.
- How did you know?

149
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,268
- I recognized him right away.
- Hello. How did you know?

150
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:56,700
Do you know the title of our show?

151
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,800
What is it?

152
00:05:59,099 --> 00:06:00,570
(Tell him.)

153
00:06:00,609 --> 00:06:02,909
Our show is called Handsome Guys.

154
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,950
(Laughing)

155
00:06:07,979 --> 00:06:09,209
He's very flustered.

156
00:06:09,223 --> 00:06:10,792
He's the first guest on our show.

157
00:06:10,793 --> 00:06:11,832
(The first guest on Handsome Guys, Jin)

158
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:13,132
- He's the best.
- By the way...

159
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,532
This is amazing.

160
00:06:14,533 --> 00:06:16,062
He can't be excluded.

161
00:06:16,463 --> 00:06:19,472
He's the only one to match the show title.

162
00:06:19,473 --> 00:06:21,241
Jin, for next week,

163
00:06:21,242 --> 00:06:24,542
- try not to schedule anything.
- Try to adjust it.

164
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:26,412
I haven't scheduled...

165
00:06:26,413 --> 00:06:28,181
anything yet for next week for this show.

166
00:06:28,182 --> 00:06:29,611
That's good.

167
00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:31,352
- Leave it free.
- Leave it free.

168
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:32,583
Don't go anywhere.

169
00:06:33,182 --> 00:06:35,821
Okay, now that we know the name of our show,

170
00:06:35,822 --> 00:06:37,552
- what kind of show is it?
- Seriously.

171
00:06:38,653 --> 00:06:40,492
On Handsome Guys,

172
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:45,733
with beautiful men who represent Korea...

173
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:47,602
(Smirking)

174
00:06:47,603 --> 00:06:50,033
It's a show that will search...

175
00:06:50,132 --> 00:06:52,131
beautiful places, beautiful cultural heritages,

176
00:06:52,132 --> 00:06:54,741
and people we're curious about in Korea.

177
00:06:54,742 --> 00:06:56,501
(Beautiful)

178
00:06:56,502 --> 00:06:57,772
("It's more beautiful...")

179
00:06:57,773 --> 00:06:58,811
("when you look at it in detail.")

180
00:06:58,812 --> 00:07:00,882
(From "Grass Flower" by Na Tae Joo)

181
00:07:01,742 --> 00:07:05,552
(Treasures on our land)

182
00:07:06,153 --> 00:07:09,322
(In detail)

183
00:07:09,783 --> 00:07:12,052
(Our tradition and people)

184
00:07:12,492 --> 00:07:15,922
(Closely)

185
00:07:17,527 --> 00:07:20,796
(The more you look, the handsomer they get)

186
00:07:21,426 --> 00:07:25,337
(In search of our heritage)

187
00:07:26,796 --> 00:07:31,536
(Why don't you join us in the evening on weekends?)

188
00:07:33,837 --> 00:07:39,046
(2024 Korea's handsome exploration of heritage)

189
00:07:40,347 --> 00:07:44,217
(The first exploration)

190
00:07:46,116 --> 00:07:49,185
(The national heritage of South Gyeongsang Province)

191
00:07:49,186 --> 00:07:51,957
I was wondering why there's only one in Busan.

192
00:07:52,197 --> 00:07:54,067
- It's South Gyeongsang Province.
- It's South Gyeongsang Province.

193
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,626
I don't recognize any of it. Do you know any?

194
00:07:57,266 --> 00:07:58,937
- I know...
- Tongdosa Temple.

195
00:07:58,967 --> 00:08:01,036
Of Gwak Jae U.

196
00:08:01,037 --> 00:08:02,206
- Really?
- Do you know him?

197
00:08:02,207 --> 00:08:03,505
I have a certification...

198
00:08:03,506 --> 00:08:05,005
in Korean history.

199
00:08:05,006 --> 00:08:06,275
- Really?
- Seriously?

200
00:08:06,276 --> 00:08:07,446
That's amazing. You have a certification?

201
00:08:07,447 --> 00:08:09,576
- I passed grade five recently.
- Why?

202
00:08:09,577 --> 00:08:11,816
I was on a show about Korean history, and I wanted to study more.

203
00:08:11,817 --> 00:08:13,217
I got the certification for my own good.

204
00:08:13,476 --> 00:08:14,586
- I wanted to study more.
- Really?

205
00:08:14,587 --> 00:08:15,816
Yes, so I know things...

206
00:08:15,817 --> 00:08:17,855
like Stone Seated Buddha.

207
00:08:17,856 --> 00:08:19,386
(Stone Seated Buddha of Gwallyongsa Temple)

208
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,327
Can you briefly explain what it is?

209
00:08:21,427 --> 00:08:22,957
I need to check on that.

210
00:08:23,886 --> 00:08:26,197
- They'll cancel your certification.
- No.

211
00:08:26,297 --> 00:08:27,865
- Was he in a righteous army?
- Don't say things like that.

212
00:08:27,866 --> 00:08:28,926
He was in a righteous army.

213
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,326
- He was in a righteous army.
- Righteous army?

214
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:32,265
- He was slightly...
- I know about him too.

215
00:08:32,266 --> 00:08:33,537
I learned about him in high school.

216
00:08:34,106 --> 00:08:36,966
- Unbelievable.
- Can you tell us what you know?

217
00:08:36,967 --> 00:08:38,975
I've heard of Yongmunsa Temple.

218
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,307
I think I've been there.

219
00:08:40,577 --> 00:08:42,306
- Upo Wetland.
- What's that?

220
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:43,307
Isn't it a wetland?

221
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:44,645
(Upo Wetland)

222
00:08:44,646 --> 00:08:46,846
- Where crocodiles live?
- Crocodiles?

223
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,687
- A place with crocodiles.
- Crocodiles?

224
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:50,016
(The youngest Sang Uk's childish beauty)

225
00:08:50,017 --> 00:08:52,587
Sang Uk isn't ordinary either.

226
00:08:53,287 --> 00:08:56,457
What's all this? Will we be going there today?

227
00:08:56,557 --> 00:08:57,557
Do we have to go there?

228
00:08:57,927 --> 00:09:01,366
Will you be visiting all of these nine places?

229
00:09:01,927 --> 00:09:03,226
Will we?

230
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:05,297
What's going on?

231
00:09:05,437 --> 00:09:07,735
You'll pick places by playing bingo.

232
00:09:07,736 --> 00:09:09,365
Is that why it's a 3-by-3 square?

233
00:09:09,366 --> 00:09:10,676
Yes, do you know how to play bingo?

234
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:13,005
- Yes.
- One complete line means bingo.

235
00:09:13,006 --> 00:09:14,605
The first one to complete a line wins.

236
00:09:14,606 --> 00:09:16,145
The center must be occupied first.

237
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:17,876
- Right.
- It's always the case in bingo.

238
00:09:18,447 --> 00:09:19,875
Tae Hyun, you're smart.

239
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:22,416
- We play this a lot.
- His experience can't be ignored.

240
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:23,885
He's resourceful.

241
00:09:23,886 --> 00:09:26,586
- He's Zhuge Liang on the show.
- He's resourceful.

242
00:09:26,587 --> 00:09:28,187
- Of course.
- He's different.

243
00:09:28,726 --> 00:09:32,696
You'll be split into a team of three.

244
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,865
(They will play bingo in 2 teams of 3.)

245
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:35,966
It's a competition.

246
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:38,666
Each team will visit the place of their choice.

247
00:09:38,667 --> 00:09:40,365
After looking at the national heritage,

248
00:09:40,366 --> 00:09:41,537
you'll be given a quiz.

249
00:09:42,366 --> 00:09:48,606
(A quiz related to the location will be given.)

250
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:51,447
If you guess the right answer,

251
00:09:51,817 --> 00:09:54,046
you'll occupy one square on the scorecard.

252
00:09:54,047 --> 00:09:55,947
(If you answer correctly, you occupy the square of the location.)

253
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:58,586
The first team to complete one line...

254
00:09:58,587 --> 00:10:00,057
will win.

255
00:10:01,287 --> 00:10:02,855
- What happens if we win?
- If we win...

256
00:10:02,856 --> 00:10:05,525
- Will we get off work?
- If you win, you'll get off work.

257
00:10:05,526 --> 00:10:08,326
(The winning team will get off work.)

258
00:10:08,327 --> 00:10:09,927
The losing team can't get off work?

259
00:10:10,366 --> 00:10:11,366
What if you lose?

260
00:10:11,537 --> 00:10:14,336
The losing team will stay one more day.

261
00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:17,706
(You'll stay one more day instead of getting off work.)

262
00:10:17,707 --> 00:10:18,806
What?

263
00:10:18,807 --> 00:10:21,275
You'll leave early in the morning to catch monkfish.

264
00:10:21,276 --> 00:10:22,306
- Monkfish?
- Monkfish?

265
00:10:22,307 --> 00:10:23,576
- Yes.
- Do you mean fishing?

266
00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:25,577
Is it a monkfish of this size?

267
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,316
Monkfish as in braised monkfish?

268
00:10:27,317 --> 00:10:28,546
(A beautiful ingredient in South Gyeongsang Province)

269
00:10:28,547 --> 00:10:29,816
How will we catch it? By fishing?

270
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:32,086
Are we going to be working?

271
00:10:32,087 --> 00:10:34,057
A fisherman promised to help out.

272
00:10:34,726 --> 00:10:37,597
(Also known as "Extreme Job")

273
00:10:37,927 --> 00:10:38,995
Let's go.

274
00:10:38,996 --> 00:10:40,525
(Like the winter monkfish meat, )

275
00:10:40,526 --> 00:10:45,236
(a chewy and thrilling penalty awaits them.)

276
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,735
Most people go out before dawn...

277
00:10:47,736 --> 00:10:49,135
around 3 or 4am.

278
00:10:49,136 --> 00:10:50,707
(The thought of going to work before dawn makes them dizzy.)

279
00:10:50,837 --> 00:10:52,276
This is...

280
00:10:52,506 --> 00:10:54,606
- Seung Ho, please say something.
- Right.

281
00:10:54,906 --> 00:10:56,847
I'm thinking about which location to visit.

282
00:10:57,577 --> 00:10:59,846
- He's a brainiac.
- I knew it.

283
00:10:59,847 --> 00:11:01,816
Geographically speaking, there are two places in Changnyeong.

284
00:11:01,817 --> 00:11:03,587
Upo Wetland and Yongmunsa Temple.

285
00:11:04,087 --> 00:11:07,317
- Did he catch that?
- He figured it out in an instant.

286
00:11:07,457 --> 00:11:09,385
- Did he catch that?
- He's right.

287
00:11:09,386 --> 00:11:10,826
- None of us...
- He already started.

288
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:12,196
Knew about that.

289
00:11:12,197 --> 00:11:14,865
It's advantageous to go to Changnyeong.

290
00:11:14,866 --> 00:11:15,966
You know what?

291
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:16,995
What about this?

292
00:11:16,996 --> 00:11:18,466
(What about this?)

293
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:19,836
Forty minutes of hiking?

294
00:11:19,837 --> 00:11:22,235
There's a round trip of hiking for 40 minutes.

295
00:11:22,236 --> 00:11:23,505
I missed that one.

296
00:11:23,506 --> 00:11:24,707
He missed it?

297
00:11:26,537 --> 00:11:27,745
- Seung Ho.
- Yes?

298
00:11:27,746 --> 00:11:29,905
You should read more carefully.

299
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:32,346
You struggle to get there,

300
00:11:32,347 --> 00:11:34,916
but if your answer is wrong, you'll have to go somewhere else?

301
00:11:34,917 --> 00:11:36,145
If your answer is wrong,

302
00:11:36,146 --> 00:11:38,086
you won't occupy that square. You must go somewhere else.

303
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:39,687
The square will be empty,

304
00:11:39,717 --> 00:11:41,356
and the other team may occupy it.

305
00:11:41,856 --> 00:11:44,596
You struggle to get there, and the other team answers correctly.

306
00:11:44,597 --> 00:11:46,495
- You can't occupy that square?
- However,

307
00:11:46,496 --> 00:11:48,625
if a team goes there and answers correctly,

308
00:11:48,626 --> 00:11:50,296
- Will it show?
- you'll see that it's occupied.

309
00:11:50,297 --> 00:11:51,635
- I see.
- Okay.

310
00:11:51,636 --> 00:11:52,697
(Just like this)

311
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:54,236
Gosh, that startled me.

312
00:11:54,606 --> 00:11:55,736
Yangsan.

313
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:58,006
Then the other team occupied it.

314
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:00,847
When we hear "Yangsan," Yangsan is occupied?

315
00:12:01,177 --> 00:12:03,576
If we're on our way there and hear that, we should turn around.

316
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:04,917
- Of course.
- Okay.

317
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:07,787
You have until 8pm tonight.

318
00:12:08,347 --> 00:12:11,717
If neither team gets a bingo until then,

319
00:12:11,986 --> 00:12:14,427
the team that occupies more squares will win.

320
00:12:15,057 --> 00:12:16,485
So one team is sure to win.

321
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,826
The game will be over.

322
00:12:17,827 --> 00:12:19,655
- You've been waiting to hear this.
- Teams.

323
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:20,865
Here are your teams.

324
00:12:20,866 --> 00:12:23,265
I'd like to hear from the younger members,

325
00:12:23,266 --> 00:12:26,135
Seung Ho and Sang Uk.

326
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,566
Is there someone you want to team up with?

327
00:12:27,567 --> 00:12:28,605
- Seung Ho.
- Just in case?

328
00:12:28,606 --> 00:12:30,466
I don't know clearly...

329
00:12:30,467 --> 00:12:32,605
with whom I want to work.

330
00:12:32,606 --> 00:12:34,576
I know whom I don't want to work with.

331
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:35,577
- Who?
- Who?

332
00:12:35,578 --> 00:12:36,676
- Dong Hyun.
- What?

333
00:12:36,677 --> 00:12:38,416
(Dong Hyun)

334
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:40,375
- Why me?
- Actually,

335
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:42,115
- I have my certification.
- before the shoot,

336
00:12:42,116 --> 00:12:45,255
we got together and introduced ourselves.

337
00:12:45,256 --> 00:12:46,957
Most of the things...

338
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:49,985
he said sounded like a lie.

339
00:12:49,986 --> 00:12:51,196
(Most of them were lies.)

340
00:12:51,197 --> 00:12:52,255
Goodness.

341
00:12:52,256 --> 00:12:53,596
We found out that they were lies.

342
00:12:53,597 --> 00:12:55,025
It's not what you think.

343
00:12:55,026 --> 00:12:57,536
I remember correctly, but I got confused with my words.

344
00:12:57,537 --> 00:13:00,296
When I met you last time, I learned that you used to play soccer.

345
00:13:00,297 --> 00:13:02,105
So I called you a goalkeeper,

346
00:13:02,106 --> 00:13:03,567
but you were a center-back.

347
00:13:03,606 --> 00:13:05,836
- I've never seen the goalkeeper.
- Wrong information.

348
00:13:05,837 --> 00:13:08,076
- I say wrong things by mistake, - Wrong information.

349
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:09,745
- but what I know is clear.
- So you know.

350
00:13:09,746 --> 00:13:10,875
I have a smart brain.

351
00:13:10,876 --> 00:13:13,015
- I can't wait to find out my team.
- Let's go.

352
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:14,176
(While their feelings are revealed)

353
00:13:14,177 --> 00:13:15,317
First of all,

354
00:13:15,717 --> 00:13:17,116
- Lee Yi Kyung, - Yes?

355
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:18,787
- Jin, - That's a relief.

356
00:13:19,356 --> 00:13:21,855
And Oh Sang Uk will be on the same team.

357
00:13:21,856 --> 00:13:24,256
(First team, Yi Kyung, Jin, and Sang Uk)

358
00:13:24,626 --> 00:13:29,297
Then Seung Ho and Dong Hyun are on the same team.

359
00:13:29,366 --> 00:13:31,265
He got unlucky.

360
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:32,866
He shouldn't have said that.

361
00:13:33,537 --> 00:13:35,405
- I'm sorry.
- Goodness.

362
00:13:35,406 --> 00:13:36,806
- They met on bad terms.
- I'm sorry.

363
00:13:36,807 --> 00:13:38,337
- What I meant was...
- It's okay.

364
00:13:38,376 --> 00:13:40,176
- They got teamed up after that.
- They met on bad terms.

365
00:13:40,177 --> 00:13:41,776
I said wrong things by mistake.

366
00:13:42,276 --> 00:13:44,446
- Don't hurt his feelings.
- I won't.

367
00:13:44,447 --> 00:13:47,217
Yi Kyung, Jin, and Sang Uk will be...

368
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:48,616
Team Handsome.

369
00:13:48,787 --> 00:13:51,316
Tae Hyun, Dong Hyun, and Seung Ho will be...

370
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:52,716
- Guys?
- Team Guys.

371
00:13:52,717 --> 00:13:55,886
(Tae Hyun, Dong Hyun, and Seung Ho on Team Guys)

372
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,125
This is how we get split.

373
00:13:58,126 --> 00:13:59,626
So that is why.

374
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:01,326
Seung Ho joined Team Guys.

375
00:14:01,327 --> 00:14:02,596
He's one of the guys.

376
00:14:02,597 --> 00:14:03,927
I'll feel more at ease.

377
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:06,996
- He's on our side.
- He's on Team Guys.

378
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:08,937
- This is funny.
- He's on our side.

379
00:14:09,006 --> 00:14:10,707
Will we get together again at the end?

380
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,875
- We can't.
- No.

381
00:14:11,876 --> 00:14:13,405
- We should go back to Seoul.
- Then I won't see...

382
00:14:13,406 --> 00:14:14,946
the three of them anymore?

383
00:14:14,947 --> 00:14:16,005
That's true.

384
00:14:16,006 --> 00:14:17,076
Is this...

385
00:14:17,077 --> 00:14:19,177
our last time seeing each other?

386
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:20,376
For now,

387
00:14:20,947 --> 00:14:22,645
check your schedule next week.

388
00:14:22,646 --> 00:14:23,946
Yes, check your schedule next week.

389
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,115
- My schedule next week?
- You should probably come back.

390
00:14:26,116 --> 00:14:28,687
Say goodbye to the three of us before leaving.

391
00:14:29,427 --> 00:14:31,125
- I'll think about it.
- Okay.

392
00:14:31,126 --> 00:14:32,796
We must win for his fans' sake.

393
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:33,926
He has to come back.

394
00:14:33,927 --> 00:14:36,567
You might need help during the competition.

395
00:14:36,797 --> 00:14:39,167
We have these cards for you.

396
00:14:39,236 --> 00:14:41,135
Come and pick one each.

397
00:14:41,136 --> 00:14:42,567
We prepared a total of six.

398
00:14:42,967 --> 00:14:44,166
- One per person?
- Now?

399
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:45,176
Yes.

400
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:47,536
(Jin picks a chance card first.)

401
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:48,546
Should I read it out loud?

402
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:49,746
Go back to your place and read it.

403
00:14:50,376 --> 00:14:51,846
- This isn't bad.
- What is it?

404
00:14:51,847 --> 00:14:54,245
- Really?
- I think I picked a good one.

405
00:14:54,246 --> 00:14:55,616
A nap of 30 minutes.

406
00:14:55,687 --> 00:14:58,286
I can choose when to put the other team to sleep for 30 minutes.

407
00:14:58,287 --> 00:14:59,656
- That's amazing.
- Nice.

408
00:15:00,217 --> 00:15:01,587
- That's amazing.
- Nice.

409
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:03,187
- That's too...
- It's really nice.

410
00:15:03,256 --> 00:15:04,826
If you think that the other team is heading to...

411
00:15:04,827 --> 00:15:07,396
- the same place, you can stop them.
- When we're moving together.

412
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:09,196
That one is intense.

413
00:15:09,197 --> 00:15:10,366
(That one is intense.)

414
00:15:10,866 --> 00:15:11,866
- Go ahead, Seung Ho.
- Okay.

415
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:12,937
Our youngest.

416
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,606
He looks scary.

417
00:15:14,766 --> 00:15:16,336
Is something the matter?

418
00:15:16,337 --> 00:15:17,706
Stop making a face.

419
00:15:17,707 --> 00:15:19,936
(The member who's resolute for no reason)

420
00:15:19,937 --> 00:15:21,105
I picked an amazing one.

421
00:15:21,106 --> 00:15:22,207
- What is it?
- Seriously.

422
00:15:23,646 --> 00:15:25,047
- Seriously.
- This is very good.

423
00:15:25,847 --> 00:15:27,276
What is it?

424
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:29,047
A chance to try again.

425
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:31,556
When your answer is incorrect,

426
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:33,985
you can get an additional hint and try again.

427
00:15:33,986 --> 00:15:35,456
They definitely have a chance.

428
00:15:35,457 --> 00:15:36,826
An additional hint?

429
00:15:36,827 --> 00:15:39,025
With an additional hint, they're likely to get it.

430
00:15:39,026 --> 00:15:41,126
Hide this right here.

431
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:42,225
Someone might...

432
00:15:42,226 --> 00:15:43,396
You guys can take a nap.

433
00:15:43,766 --> 00:15:45,097
Okay.

434
00:15:45,797 --> 00:15:46,866
I will take care of it.

435
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:48,635
(How about Sang Uk's card?)

436
00:15:48,636 --> 00:15:49,967
Is this for real?

437
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:51,307
Gosh.

438
00:15:51,308 --> 00:15:52,537
What are you doing?

439
00:15:53,276 --> 00:15:54,546
Seriously...

440
00:15:54,547 --> 00:15:56,246
- What is it?
- A free car wash.

441
00:15:56,307 --> 00:15:57,605
- What?
- What is that?

442
00:15:57,606 --> 00:15:59,046
- That's the best.
- I must use this...

443
00:15:59,047 --> 00:16:00,077
before completing the bingo.

444
00:16:00,317 --> 00:16:01,416
Do you mean this vehicle?

445
00:16:01,417 --> 00:16:03,745
Do we have to use it?

446
00:16:03,746 --> 00:16:06,515
(A car wash is necessary before the game is over.)

447
00:16:06,516 --> 00:16:07,856
Where will he get a car wash?

448
00:16:08,457 --> 00:16:09,756
I used up all my luck...

449
00:16:09,886 --> 00:16:11,097
in Paris.

450
00:16:11,626 --> 00:16:13,726
- This is terrible.
- No, it's okay.

451
00:16:13,996 --> 00:16:15,066
No, it's okay.

452
00:16:15,067 --> 00:16:16,265
We can get it done quickly.

453
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,697
(Jin encourages the younger one.)

454
00:16:18,167 --> 00:16:19,666
- Hey.
- Is it good?

455
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,066
We got very lucky.

456
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:22,067
- Why?
- Why?

457
00:16:22,068 --> 00:16:23,866
A card to track the other team's location.

458
00:16:24,677 --> 00:16:26,807
You can find out the other team's current location.

459
00:16:26,837 --> 00:16:27,906
(It's getting worse and worse.)

460
00:16:27,946 --> 00:16:31,116
- We must win no matter what today.
- Please.

461
00:16:31,347 --> 00:16:33,476
(Embarrassed)

462
00:16:33,477 --> 00:16:35,047
Use that card when we're getting a car wash.

463
00:16:35,116 --> 00:16:36,587
If they do,

464
00:16:36,646 --> 00:16:37,955
they'll see that we're at the car wash.

465
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:38,986
(Location)

466
00:16:38,987 --> 00:16:40,487
You don't know when they'll use it.

467
00:16:43,156 --> 00:16:44,796
This is really terrible.

468
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:45,826
He said "terrible."

469
00:16:45,827 --> 00:16:46,827
(He said "terrible.")

470
00:16:47,057 --> 00:16:48,796
- Shall we do it together?
- Let's do it.

471
00:16:48,797 --> 00:16:50,267
(Only two chance cards remain.)

472
00:16:51,297 --> 00:16:52,966
Do you want to switch or not?

473
00:16:53,436 --> 00:16:55,306
- Do you want to switch or not?
- Let's switch.

474
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:57,806
- His team has been getting lucky.
- Right.

475
00:16:57,807 --> 00:16:58,936
- We switched.
- We switched.

476
00:16:59,007 --> 00:17:00,037
It feels strange.

477
00:17:01,507 --> 00:17:03,047
What is it? Let me see.

478
00:17:03,706 --> 00:17:05,875
We got one too.

479
00:17:05,876 --> 00:17:07,446
- I'm glad that they didn't get it.
- I agree.

480
00:17:07,716 --> 00:17:09,347
- What is it?
- What do you have?

481
00:17:10,017 --> 00:17:11,486
(Did their fate get switched?)

482
00:17:11,487 --> 00:17:13,185
- Unbelievable.
- There must be two bad ones.

483
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:14,727
(Darn it.)

484
00:17:14,956 --> 00:17:16,685
- I got lucky after switching.
- I'm glad you did.

485
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:18,797
Wishing happy birthday.

486
00:17:18,856 --> 00:17:21,297
Buy a cake for someone whose birthday is today.

487
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:23,625
- That sounds terrible.
- That's the worst.

488
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,965
Someone whose birthday is this week. Wait.

489
00:17:25,966 --> 00:17:27,696
How will I find someone whose birthday is this week?

490
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:29,506
We'll have to ask the passersby.

491
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:31,236
That one is unbelievable.

492
00:17:31,237 --> 00:17:32,736
Right, it's horrible.

493
00:17:32,737 --> 00:17:33,935
(Did he cause trouble again?)

494
00:17:33,936 --> 00:17:35,047
By the way...

495
00:17:35,906 --> 00:17:37,476
I apologize.

496
00:17:37,477 --> 00:17:38,976
It's okay.

497
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:40,715
- At first...
- Your intuition was right.

498
00:17:40,716 --> 00:17:42,317
- Yes.
- Everything was going so well.

499
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,415
Now that we're split into teams,

500
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,155
we have to read the room carefully.

501
00:17:46,156 --> 00:17:47,826
Should we go to the location in the center?

502
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:49,286
Or somewhere in Busan because we're already here?

503
00:17:49,287 --> 00:17:51,027
Yes, you're right.

504
00:17:51,426 --> 00:17:53,426
- Where are you going first?
- Which place is the best?

505
00:17:53,527 --> 00:17:54,925
We should definitely go to Yangsan.

506
00:17:54,926 --> 00:17:56,696
If we get Yangsan, we'll win.

507
00:17:57,227 --> 00:17:58,766
- Is that our strategy?
- Yes.

508
00:17:58,767 --> 00:18:00,436
- Then let's get there before them.
- Okay.

509
00:18:00,797 --> 00:18:02,106
To Yangsan?

510
00:18:02,237 --> 00:18:03,936
The one at the center looks the best.

511
00:18:04,436 --> 00:18:05,506
We must go to Yangsan no matter what.

512
00:18:05,507 --> 00:18:07,036
(A war of nerves over Yangsan, the center of the scoreboard)

513
00:18:07,037 --> 00:18:10,406
- We should decide together.
- Right.

514
00:18:10,646 --> 00:18:11,915
- We should decide?
- Let's decide the first location.

515
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,317
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

516
00:18:14,347 --> 00:18:16,546
How about a relay of rock-paper-scissors?

517
00:18:16,547 --> 00:18:18,786
- Let's do that.
- A relay sounds good.

518
00:18:18,787 --> 00:18:20,655
People might complain if one from each team plays.

519
00:18:20,656 --> 00:18:21,685
A relay of three players.

520
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:23,326
- Dong Hyun should go first.
- Okay.

521
00:18:23,327 --> 00:18:25,026
Why me?

522
00:18:25,027 --> 00:18:26,926
- You're bound to lose.
- Right.

523
00:18:26,956 --> 00:18:28,796
- I'll show you my energy.
- Okay.

524
00:18:28,797 --> 00:18:30,527
- I'll show you my energy.
- Sure.

525
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:31,997
Sang Uk will go.

526
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,337
Are you giving up on him already?

527
00:18:33,936 --> 00:18:35,267
I feel unlucky today.

528
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:37,767
Can't you see through him with your fencing skills?

529
00:18:38,007 --> 00:18:39,206
I'll take a look.

530
00:18:39,977 --> 00:18:42,077
(I can read Dong Hyun's mind.)

531
00:18:42,977 --> 00:18:45,175
The two of them picked unlucky cards today.

532
00:18:45,176 --> 00:18:47,376
(Unlucky brothers start the relay.)

533
00:18:47,777 --> 00:18:49,886
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

534
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:51,586
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

535
00:18:51,587 --> 00:18:53,986
Yes!

536
00:18:53,987 --> 00:18:55,185
I knew it. Okay.

537
00:18:55,186 --> 00:18:56,726
- Good job.
- The relay continues.

538
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:58,925
- Next player.
- It's okay. We knew he'd lose.

539
00:18:58,926 --> 00:19:00,395
All right.

540
00:19:00,396 --> 00:19:02,026
(Letting him pass)

541
00:19:02,027 --> 00:19:03,395
- The relay continues.
- Next player.

542
00:19:03,396 --> 00:19:05,037
It's okay. We knew he'd lose.

543
00:19:05,337 --> 00:19:07,337
- All right.
- It was expected.

544
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:10,135
All right, rock-paper-scissors.

545
00:19:10,136 --> 00:19:11,605
Okay!

546
00:19:11,606 --> 00:19:13,105
(He wins 2 consecutive times.)

547
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:14,135
Rock-paper-scissors.

548
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:15,507
Okay!

549
00:19:16,007 --> 00:19:18,316
He's different because he's a fencer.

550
00:19:18,317 --> 00:19:20,277
- Seung Ho.
- We'll get the center square.

551
00:19:20,517 --> 00:19:21,716
Please.

552
00:19:22,087 --> 00:19:23,886
Don't worry. I have my method.

553
00:19:24,186 --> 00:19:25,386
He has a method.

554
00:19:25,416 --> 00:19:26,716
Seung Ho has a method.

555
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:29,356
Rock-paper-scissors.

556
00:19:29,487 --> 00:19:31,027
Nice!

557
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:33,455
Nice! Nice fencing.

558
00:19:33,456 --> 00:19:35,796
- What's gotten into him?
- Nice.

559
00:19:35,797 --> 00:19:36,865
Rock-paper-scissors.

560
00:19:36,866 --> 00:19:38,237
(And...)

561
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,297
Let them have it.

562
00:19:40,337 --> 00:19:42,365
We have our plan B.

563
00:19:42,366 --> 00:19:45,777
- We don't have any plan B.
- Plan B?

564
00:19:45,837 --> 00:19:48,047
- Plan B?
- We don't have any plan B.

565
00:19:48,706 --> 00:19:50,105
- That was good.
- We have no plan B.

566
00:19:50,106 --> 00:19:51,445
The score is neat.

567
00:19:51,446 --> 00:19:53,247
Three to zero is nice and neat.

568
00:19:53,747 --> 00:19:55,786
(The neat freak is quite shameless.)

569
00:19:55,787 --> 00:19:57,215
You expected me to lose, but...

570
00:19:57,216 --> 00:19:59,355
(You expected me to lose, but...)

571
00:19:59,356 --> 00:20:01,086
- Where are you headed?
- You expected me to lose.

572
00:20:01,087 --> 00:20:02,226
Sang Uk, you should decide.

573
00:20:02,227 --> 00:20:03,486
He's the winner and the hero.

574
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:05,195
Sang Uk, pick a location as our hero.

575
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:06,425
We'll go to Yangsan.

576
00:20:06,426 --> 00:20:08,027
- The center one first?
- Yes.

577
00:20:08,366 --> 00:20:09,826
The center one?

578
00:20:09,827 --> 00:20:12,165
Where are you headed? You should tell us too.

579
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,096
- We must go to Busan first.
- Okay.

580
00:20:14,097 --> 00:20:15,605
- Busan?
- Definitely.

581
00:20:15,606 --> 00:20:16,965
We decided on the first location.

582
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,006
- Okay.
- Let's be honest.

583
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:19,306
Let's keep our promise...

584
00:20:19,307 --> 00:20:21,175
- since it's our first day.
- We should keep our word.

585
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:23,205
If I see you in front of the Eastern Palaces...

586
00:20:23,206 --> 00:20:25,445
on the first day,

587
00:20:25,446 --> 00:20:27,115
that means war.

588
00:20:27,116 --> 00:20:28,786
(That will mean war.)

589
00:20:28,787 --> 00:20:30,546
- Both of us...
- We're going to Busan.

590
00:20:30,547 --> 00:20:31,615
- We're going to Busan.
- We won't go there.

591
00:20:31,616 --> 00:20:33,517
We're going to Yangsan first.

592
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:35,087
The fight starts now.

593
00:20:35,626 --> 00:20:37,256
- Okay.
- Let's go.

594
00:20:37,257 --> 00:20:38,455
Is this the scoreboard?

595
00:20:38,456 --> 00:20:40,356
(The race is in full swing.)

596
00:20:40,527 --> 00:20:42,096
Good luck today.

597
00:20:42,097 --> 00:20:44,465
I enjoyed shooting with you today.

598
00:20:44,466 --> 00:20:46,996
I hope to see you again at another shoot.

599
00:20:46,997 --> 00:20:48,067
He's so mean.

600
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:50,506
- It's been...
- Right away?

601
00:20:50,507 --> 00:20:52,807
- Our paths may cross again.
- Right?

602
00:20:54,906 --> 00:20:56,476
How long have you been driving?

603
00:20:56,477 --> 00:20:58,346
- I started in high school.
- Are you experienced...

604
00:20:58,347 --> 00:20:59,715
- What?
- Since high school.

605
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,046
I got my license when I was 19.

606
00:21:01,047 --> 00:21:03,286
The age limit was 18, so I got it when I was 19.

607
00:21:03,287 --> 00:21:04,385
- Did you start driving right away?
- Yes.

608
00:21:04,386 --> 00:21:06,655
Whatever you guys want. I'm willing to drive.

609
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:08,787
If you're good at driving...

610
00:21:09,856 --> 00:21:11,026
I'm good at driving,

611
00:21:11,027 --> 00:21:13,557
- but tell me what you'd like.
- I'm also good.

612
00:21:13,797 --> 00:21:15,426
Then it's up to you.

613
00:21:15,866 --> 00:21:17,267
- What do you prefer?
- Here's a thing.

614
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:19,036
We're taking one vehicle,

615
00:21:19,037 --> 00:21:20,635
and I know what's on your mind.

616
00:21:20,636 --> 00:21:23,165
We'll be going to many places,

617
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,837
- so we can take turns driving.
- We have to take turns.

618
00:21:26,436 --> 00:21:28,145
Where's our first location in Yangsan?

619
00:21:28,146 --> 00:21:29,746
We should look it up on GPS.

620
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,746
Yangsan, Habuk-myeon,

621
00:21:31,747 --> 00:21:33,976
- Habuk-myeon.
- Tongdosa-ro.

622
00:21:33,977 --> 00:21:35,047
- It's 108.
- It's 108.

623
00:21:35,716 --> 00:21:37,346
- It will take...
- One hour.

624
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:38,487
- One hour?
- It's 58km.

625
00:21:38,616 --> 00:21:39,816
We'd better get going.

626
00:21:39,817 --> 00:21:41,386
Let's go.

627
00:21:42,356 --> 00:21:43,556
My shoulder hurts.

628
00:21:43,557 --> 00:21:45,726
We need to be smart about this.

629
00:21:45,727 --> 00:21:48,126
(In the end, Dong Hyun decides to drive and they'll take turns.)

630
00:21:48,926 --> 00:21:52,165
We need to be smart about this.

631
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,036
(Tongdosa Temple in Yangsan, the Eastern Palaces in Busan)

632
00:21:54,037 --> 00:21:56,466
If we occupy Busan,

633
00:21:56,866 --> 00:21:58,737
we'll have to go to Changnyeong no matter what.

634
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:01,746
If we occupy Changnyeong as expected,

635
00:22:01,747 --> 00:22:03,276
we will win.

636
00:22:03,277 --> 00:22:06,646
Right, but if we fail to occupy Yongseondae,

637
00:22:06,847 --> 00:22:09,145
we'll need to occupy Upo Wetland.

638
00:22:09,146 --> 00:22:10,686
Then we have to go to Namhae.

639
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:12,885
You know what I mean?

640
00:22:12,886 --> 00:22:14,615
We have to occupy that no matter what.

641
00:22:14,616 --> 00:22:16,456
It takes four hours to get to Namhae.

642
00:22:18,156 --> 00:22:20,057
We should have won the rock-paper-scissors.

643
00:22:21,926 --> 00:22:25,936
(Team Handsome sets off first.)

644
00:22:26,797 --> 00:22:27,837
They're leaving.

645
00:22:28,406 --> 00:22:29,465
They're leaving right away.

646
00:22:29,466 --> 00:22:30,506
(Should I follow them?)

647
00:22:30,507 --> 00:22:31,636
Should I follow them?

648
00:22:31,737 --> 00:22:32,806
Go to Busan first.

649
00:22:32,807 --> 00:22:34,635
- Let's go to the Eastern Palaces.
- How do we get there?

650
00:22:34,636 --> 00:22:36,645
Let's go to the Eastern Palaces first.

651
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,915
The Eastern Palaces don't come up on GPS.

652
00:22:38,916 --> 00:22:40,077
(In a hurry)

653
00:22:40,716 --> 00:22:42,616
Why did Changgyeonggung Palace come up?

654
00:22:43,616 --> 00:22:44,987
It's right in the front.

655
00:22:45,557 --> 00:22:47,516
It's 22 Gudong in Seo-gu.

656
00:22:47,517 --> 00:22:48,956
Where is D?

657
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:52,056
He's a bad driver, so we're setting off late.

658
00:22:52,057 --> 00:22:53,496
Like this?

659
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,497
(He's bad with gadgets.)

660
00:22:55,426 --> 00:22:57,566
Here we go. We must hurry.

661
00:22:57,567 --> 00:22:58,767
- Let's go.
- We don't need to hurry.

662
00:22:58,966 --> 00:23:00,895
Tae Hyun, I know the neighborhood very well.

663
00:23:00,896 --> 00:23:04,105
It's over there where there's a skyscraper.

664
00:23:04,106 --> 00:23:05,106
I see.

665
00:23:05,107 --> 00:23:06,635
(Heading to the Eastern Palaces in Busan)

666
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,176
The Eastern Palaces, palace.

667
00:23:08,446 --> 00:23:10,476
Tell me more. I can try...

668
00:23:10,477 --> 00:23:12,547
The Eastern Palaces is a painting of palaces.

669
00:23:12,777 --> 00:23:15,185
(A painting of palaces?)

670
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,616
"It's a painting of Changdeokgung Palace..."

671
00:23:18,116 --> 00:23:20,587
"and Changgyeonggung Palace..."

672
00:23:20,757 --> 00:23:22,526
"from the bird-eye's view."

673
00:23:22,527 --> 00:23:24,257
I get it now.

674
00:23:25,156 --> 00:23:28,195
Changdeokgung Palace is next to Gyeongbokgung Palace.

675
00:23:28,196 --> 00:23:29,866
They look the same.

676
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:33,435
Sejo of Joseon might have lived there.

677
00:23:33,436 --> 00:23:34,497
The Eastern Palaces.

678
00:23:35,866 --> 00:23:40,176
I lived in this neighborhood in Busan over ten years.

679
00:23:40,876 --> 00:23:42,547
I never saw the Eastern Palaces.

680
00:23:42,747 --> 00:23:44,306
You don't get a chance to see this.

681
00:23:44,307 --> 00:23:47,376
Right, but I could have heard about it.

682
00:23:47,946 --> 00:23:49,716
I never heard of it.

683
00:23:52,686 --> 00:23:54,317
You arrived at the destination.

684
00:23:55,227 --> 00:23:56,456
It's on a school campus.

685
00:23:57,156 --> 00:23:58,726
- Inside here?
- Yes.

686
00:23:58,727 --> 00:23:59,895
Seokdang Museum?

687
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:03,696
(University's Bumin Campus)

688
00:24:04,997 --> 00:24:07,037
It must be around here.

689
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,506
- What?
- They're here.

690
00:24:08,507 --> 00:24:09,507
See?

691
00:24:09,508 --> 00:24:12,307
(There's a vehicle that arrived first.)

692
00:24:12,737 --> 00:24:14,777
Tell me the address in Busan.

693
00:24:15,146 --> 00:24:17,006
- We should see how close it is.
- It should take 30 minutes.

694
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:18,446
It takes 15 minutes. It's around the corner.

695
00:24:18,577 --> 00:24:20,516
- Let's go there first.
- Really?

696
00:24:20,517 --> 00:24:21,547
Yes.

697
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:23,816
(Really?)

698
00:24:23,817 --> 00:24:25,356
Let's go.

699
00:24:25,886 --> 00:24:28,016
- It's foolish not to go to Busan.
- Right.

700
00:24:28,017 --> 00:24:29,155
From Busan...

701
00:24:29,156 --> 00:24:32,355
They will feel dejected when they see our car over there.

702
00:24:32,356 --> 00:24:33,456
(He's easy to influence.)

703
00:24:34,396 --> 00:24:36,596
(Waste of time)

704
00:24:36,597 --> 00:24:37,796
I knew it.

705
00:24:37,797 --> 00:24:39,736
Should we go directly to Yangsan?

706
00:24:39,737 --> 00:24:40,837
Let's go.

707
00:24:41,366 --> 00:24:42,566
- Is that right?
- Will it be okay?

708
00:24:42,567 --> 00:24:44,006
- What do you mean?
- I mean,

709
00:24:44,007 --> 00:24:46,276
- going to Yangsan now.
- Definitely.

710
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,506
- We should definitely go.
- Definitely.

711
00:24:47,507 --> 00:24:48,807
We won't get the right answer now.

712
00:24:49,277 --> 00:24:51,405
We wanted to go to Yangsan anyway.

713
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:55,185
(Yangsan, Busan)

714
00:24:55,186 --> 00:24:56,287
This is incredible.

715
00:24:58,257 --> 00:25:00,215
Yangsan. Changnyeong.

716
00:25:00,216 --> 00:25:01,685
(In that case...)

717
00:25:01,686 --> 00:25:05,097
So you don't plan to go...

718
00:25:05,396 --> 00:25:07,425
to Tongyeong or Namhae, right?

719
00:25:07,426 --> 00:25:08,796
- These are second on the list.
- Right.

720
00:25:08,797 --> 00:25:10,696
- For now...
- That's a difficult word.

721
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:12,037
Tongyeong.

722
00:25:13,067 --> 00:25:15,267
We must do this no matter what.

723
00:25:16,037 --> 00:25:17,837
We failed to occupy the Eastern Palaces.

724
00:25:18,206 --> 00:25:19,336
We have to go to Yangsan,

725
00:25:19,337 --> 00:25:20,405
Changnyeong, and Haman.

726
00:25:20,406 --> 00:25:21,705
We should go to Changnyeong first.

727
00:25:21,706 --> 00:25:23,945
Then they'll have to go to Namhae.

728
00:25:23,946 --> 00:25:25,747
- Great, it means that we won.
- Go to Changnyeong first.

729
00:25:26,277 --> 00:25:28,175
If we occupy Yangsan and Changnyeong,

730
00:25:28,176 --> 00:25:30,215
Yi Kyung's team that got Busan...

731
00:25:30,216 --> 00:25:33,456
has no choice but to go to Namhae.

732
00:25:35,757 --> 00:25:38,395
What do you call it when you fall for your own trick?

733
00:25:38,396 --> 00:25:39,856
He shot himself in the foot?

734
00:25:40,126 --> 00:25:41,695
I think that's right.

735
00:25:41,696 --> 00:25:42,696
That's it.

736
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:47,537
(A moment ago in Busan)

737
00:25:47,797 --> 00:25:51,267
Is this Dong-A University Museum?

738
00:25:51,936 --> 00:25:53,537
It's inside the museum.

739
00:25:54,077 --> 00:25:55,576
It's on the university campus.

740
00:25:55,577 --> 00:25:57,946
The building is on the university campus.

741
00:25:59,047 --> 00:26:04,446
(There's a national treasure with an unfamiliar name.)

742
00:26:07,987 --> 00:26:10,126
We definitely got here first.

743
00:26:10,257 --> 00:26:13,796
(A treasure house that we didn't know)

744
00:26:13,797 --> 00:26:15,796
- Hello.
- Hello.

745
00:26:15,797 --> 00:26:16,996
Welcome.

746
00:26:16,997 --> 00:26:19,596
I'm the director of Seokdang Museum.

747
00:26:19,597 --> 00:26:21,636
I'm Professor Kim Ki Soo.

748
00:26:21,767 --> 00:26:22,866
Nice to meet you.

749
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:25,175
This museum is on a university campus.

750
00:26:25,176 --> 00:26:27,806
Yes, established in 1959,

751
00:26:27,807 --> 00:26:30,347
it's the first museum in Busan.

752
00:26:30,646 --> 00:26:32,115
- The first museum in Busan?
- Yes.

753
00:26:32,116 --> 00:26:34,615
There was no public museum back then.

754
00:26:34,616 --> 00:26:36,886
During the Korean War,

755
00:26:37,487 --> 00:26:40,057
the building was used as a government office building.

756
00:26:40,216 --> 00:26:42,126
- A government office building?
- Yes.

757
00:26:42,527 --> 00:26:44,926
The pseudonym of the founder is Seokdang.

758
00:26:45,156 --> 00:26:46,556
- Is it his pseudonym?
- Yes.

759
00:26:46,557 --> 00:26:49,695
During the period of chaos,

760
00:26:49,696 --> 00:26:52,266
many Korean relics were taken out of Korea.

761
00:26:52,267 --> 00:26:54,896
The founder collected the relics that were taken out.

762
00:26:56,007 --> 00:26:58,577
- These precious relics...
- That's important.

763
00:26:58,936 --> 00:27:00,777
Were donated to the school.

764
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:02,806
We have two national treasures...

765
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:05,776
and about 200 designated cultural properties.

766
00:27:05,777 --> 00:27:07,476
In the entire country,

767
00:27:07,477 --> 00:27:10,215
it's rare to find a university museum with so many relics.

768
00:27:10,216 --> 00:27:11,385
Right.

769
00:27:11,386 --> 00:27:13,715
It's so big for a university museum.

770
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:14,987
The quality is high.

771
00:27:15,156 --> 00:27:18,496
We have a total of six exhibition rooms like this.

772
00:27:18,497 --> 00:27:20,426
- Six of these?
- Yes.

773
00:27:21,297 --> 00:27:23,066
Is there an entrance fee?

774
00:27:23,067 --> 00:27:24,726
- No.
- On top of that, it's free?

775
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:25,837
That's right.

776
00:27:26,097 --> 00:27:28,165
- The maintenance cost must be high.
- Including the public?

777
00:27:28,166 --> 00:27:29,236
It's free?

778
00:27:29,237 --> 00:27:30,267
Really?

779
00:27:30,507 --> 00:27:31,776
It's amazing that it's free.

780
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:33,777
- Please come this way.
- Okay.

781
00:27:34,436 --> 00:27:37,746
When I heard that you were visiting today,

782
00:27:37,747 --> 00:27:40,777
we brought out two relics that had been hidden in storage.

783
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:43,316
Why did you bring out these two?

784
00:27:43,317 --> 00:27:46,256
I'll explain now.

785
00:27:46,257 --> 00:27:49,886
This is a painting by Kim Yun Gyeom.

786
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:53,496
During the Joseon Dynasty, he painted...

787
00:27:53,497 --> 00:27:56,326
beautiful sceneries in Yeongnam area while sightseeing.

788
00:27:56,327 --> 00:27:57,566
(Album of Landscapes of the Yeongnam Area)

789
00:27:57,567 --> 00:28:00,797
In the painting, do you recognize this place?

790
00:28:01,966 --> 00:28:04,006
- It's...
- It's Haeundae.

791
00:28:04,007 --> 00:28:05,175
It's a famous place in Busan...

792
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:06,675
- called Taejongdae.
- "Taejongdae?"

793
00:28:06,676 --> 00:28:07,906
Your answer was close.

794
00:28:08,676 --> 00:28:12,547
("Taejongdae" in Album of Landscapes of the Yeongnam Area)

795
00:28:14,616 --> 00:28:17,886
(A refreshing view where you can almost hear the waves)

796
00:28:19,817 --> 00:28:22,385
This one is a painting...

797
00:28:22,386 --> 00:28:24,226
- of Taejongdae.
- It looks the same.

798
00:28:24,227 --> 00:28:26,155
- Yes.
- Only the trees disappeared.

799
00:28:26,156 --> 00:28:28,895
Right? These are the rocks.

800
00:28:28,896 --> 00:28:29,996
- This?
- Like this,

801
00:28:29,997 --> 00:28:33,267
the lines are short and straight.

802
00:28:33,537 --> 00:28:37,066
This is called Jinkyung landscape painting.

803
00:28:37,067 --> 00:28:38,165
I see.

804
00:28:38,166 --> 00:28:39,175
(Jinkyung landscape painting was popular...)

805
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,176
(during the late Joseon Dynasty.)

806
00:28:40,977 --> 00:28:42,645
This way...

807
00:28:42,646 --> 00:28:43,976
(One more painting of the surrounding view)

808
00:28:43,977 --> 00:28:45,277
- This is...
- What's this?

809
00:28:45,577 --> 00:28:47,476
It's called Chochungdo.

810
00:28:47,477 --> 00:28:48,986
Wasn't it painted...

811
00:28:48,987 --> 00:28:51,046
- Exactly.
- by Sin Saimdang?

812
00:28:51,047 --> 00:28:52,115
We talked about it before.

813
00:28:52,116 --> 00:28:54,287
I have quite a bit of knowledge.

814
00:28:56,057 --> 00:28:58,556
(Embroidered Chochungdo Folding Screen)

815
00:28:58,557 --> 00:29:01,356
(From 1700s)

816
00:29:02,997 --> 00:29:06,566
(An elegant garden on the folding screen)

817
00:29:06,567 --> 00:29:09,135
This is a painting by Sin Saimdang...

818
00:29:09,136 --> 00:29:11,365
called Chochungdo.

819
00:29:11,366 --> 00:29:12,777
- Is it a painting?
- This is...

820
00:29:12,906 --> 00:29:15,577
the folding screen version of the painting.

821
00:29:16,946 --> 00:29:18,645
(Sin Saimdang painted Chochungdo, )

822
00:29:18,646 --> 00:29:20,446
(which is a still life painting of plants and insects.)

823
00:29:23,446 --> 00:29:25,685
(Among copies of the folding screens made by generations to come, )

824
00:29:25,686 --> 00:29:27,757
(this one is known to be the most beautiful.)

825
00:29:29,156 --> 00:29:30,156
Did she paint it?

826
00:29:30,656 --> 00:29:32,355
- It looks embroidered.
- Right?

827
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:35,965
Colored threads were embroidered on black silk.

828
00:29:35,966 --> 00:29:37,195
It's embroidered?

829
00:29:37,196 --> 00:29:38,536
- Isn't it embroidered?
- Yes.

830
00:29:38,537 --> 00:29:40,236
As you can see,

831
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:43,336
there are eggplants and plants like chrysanthemum.

832
00:29:43,337 --> 00:29:45,605
There are also butterflies,

833
00:29:45,606 --> 00:29:47,676
plants, and insects.

834
00:29:47,876 --> 00:29:50,546
As these were the theme,

835
00:29:50,547 --> 00:29:52,346
it's called Chochungdo.

836
00:29:52,347 --> 00:29:54,615
- I see.
- I don't know much about art,

837
00:29:54,616 --> 00:29:56,685
- but it looks incredible.
- Right?

838
00:29:56,686 --> 00:29:58,557
Do I look like a nobleman standing here?

839
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:00,616
(When did you get there?)

840
00:30:01,587 --> 00:30:03,425
He looks like a scholar.

841
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,926
Someone young who's about to take his state exam.

842
00:30:08,196 --> 00:30:10,097
Someone who studies a lot?

843
00:30:11,597 --> 00:30:13,836
There's a secret in here.

844
00:30:13,837 --> 00:30:15,266
Do you have a 50,000-won bill?

845
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:16,436
- I do.
- Okay.

846
00:30:16,567 --> 00:30:17,837
You have a lot of money, Yi Kyung.

847
00:30:18,136 --> 00:30:20,936
Do you see the drawing in the front?

848
00:30:21,406 --> 00:30:23,445
- There are eggplants.
- There's a drawing.

849
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,905
- If you look carefully...
- Where is it?

850
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,675
Do you see the eggplants at the bottom?

851
00:30:26,676 --> 00:30:27,915
Doesn't it come up to the top?

852
00:30:27,916 --> 00:30:29,846
- This is it.
- The one in the back?

853
00:30:29,847 --> 00:30:31,286
Yes, the one in the back. It's faint.

854
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,655
(The folding screen is hidden.)

855
00:30:32,656 --> 00:30:34,355
Is this the same one?

856
00:30:34,356 --> 00:30:36,356
When the 50,000-won bill was first made,

857
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:38,026
the Korea Minting and Security Printing Corporation...

858
00:30:38,027 --> 00:30:39,426
came by to take a photo of this.

859
00:30:40,426 --> 00:30:42,395
They took a photo of it, and had it engraved...

860
00:30:42,396 --> 00:30:44,326
- along with Sin Saimdang.
- That's right.

861
00:30:44,327 --> 00:30:46,936
Because it was Sin Saimdang's painting,

862
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,567
this was added in the background.

863
00:30:50,507 --> 00:30:52,076
What do you think? They came by to take a photo of it.

864
00:30:52,077 --> 00:30:56,176
The two you saw earlier are just treasures...

865
00:30:56,446 --> 00:30:57,905
while this is a national treasure.

866
00:30:57,906 --> 00:30:59,715
It's one of the most important pieces of artwork we have.

867
00:30:59,716 --> 00:31:00,747
(A national treasure and a handsome heritage on the bingo board)

868
00:31:05,247 --> 00:31:09,057
(National treasure: The Eastern Palaces)

869
00:31:10,886 --> 00:31:12,355
(Painting by an unknown artist from the 1800s)

870
00:31:12,356 --> 00:31:14,856
(It is 584cm wide and 275cm long with 16 fold screens.)

871
00:31:15,327 --> 00:31:17,297
Above anything else, it's grand.

872
00:31:17,626 --> 00:31:19,837
- The Eastern Palaces?
- It's called the Eastern Palaces.

873
00:31:20,037 --> 00:31:22,705
In Seoul, there's Gyeongbokgung Palace.

874
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:25,435
This was given its name because it is a drawing...

875
00:31:25,436 --> 00:31:27,307
of the two palaces to the east of it.

876
00:31:27,477 --> 00:31:29,277
That's why it's called the Eastern Palaces.

877
00:31:29,646 --> 00:31:32,576
- The right of Gyeongbokgung Palace.
- The palaces to the east.

878
00:31:32,577 --> 00:31:34,415
The palaces to the east.

879
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:36,816
We have Changdeokgung Palace and Changgyeonggung Palace.

880
00:31:36,817 --> 00:31:38,416
Changdeokgung Palace and Changgyeonggung Palace.

881
00:31:38,517 --> 00:31:41,185
- This area here is Daehak-ro.
- That's right.

882
00:31:41,186 --> 00:31:42,757
We've all seen them while passing by.

883
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:44,287
I've never seen them before.

884
00:31:44,456 --> 00:31:46,597
I probably visited them during my younger years.

885
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:53,337
(You don't have to visit the palace to know how big it is.)

886
00:31:54,966 --> 00:31:57,605
If you look at it closely, you'll see...

887
00:31:57,606 --> 00:31:59,875
the names of the quarters and houses.

888
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:00,876
Right.

889
00:32:01,206 --> 00:32:03,146
- Yes. In Chinese characters.
- Right.

890
00:32:03,206 --> 00:32:04,577
- Above the tiles.
- I see them.

891
00:32:05,347 --> 00:32:07,746
Behind them, you'll see other quarters...

892
00:32:07,747 --> 00:32:10,115
that were essential to life at the palace.

893
00:32:10,116 --> 00:32:12,016
It's safe to say that...

894
00:32:12,017 --> 00:32:14,615
it's the most realistic drawing...

895
00:32:14,616 --> 00:32:16,526
- we have from that time.
- It's fascinating.

896
00:32:16,527 --> 00:32:18,256
I'm curious about the artist.

897
00:32:18,257 --> 00:32:19,296
Of course.

898
00:32:19,297 --> 00:32:20,855
Here's why it's a national treasure.

899
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,366
Only two of these have been discovered.

900
00:32:23,866 --> 00:32:25,895
One is at the museum in Korea University...

901
00:32:25,896 --> 00:32:27,136
while we have the other one.

902
00:32:27,297 --> 00:32:31,566
It's assumed that only three were drawn...

903
00:32:31,567 --> 00:32:34,806
under the supervision of the king, the crown prince,

904
00:32:34,807 --> 00:32:38,105
and the department that oversaw the project.

905
00:32:38,106 --> 00:32:40,846
Having this drawing at the time is the equivalent...

906
00:32:40,847 --> 00:32:43,446
of knowing military secrets.

907
00:32:43,686 --> 00:32:44,746
Of course.

908
00:32:44,747 --> 00:32:45,756
- Maps were used for everything.
- Exactly.

909
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:46,816
Like intelligence units.

910
00:32:46,817 --> 00:32:48,955
Since this was a drawing of palaces,

911
00:32:48,956 --> 00:32:51,385
- Absolutely.
- you can imagine...

912
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,895
The enemies could use this...

913
00:32:52,896 --> 00:32:54,395
- to carry out assassinations.
- Exactly.

914
00:32:54,396 --> 00:32:55,726
- You're right.
- That's why we assume...

915
00:32:55,727 --> 00:32:57,066
that only three people...

916
00:32:57,067 --> 00:32:58,566
were allowed this drawing.

917
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:00,066
I get it now.

918
00:33:00,067 --> 00:33:02,836
In the present day, this is used as a reference...

919
00:33:02,837 --> 00:33:05,806
when restoring traditional buildings...

920
00:33:05,807 --> 00:33:07,237
that were destroyed due to fire.

921
00:33:09,807 --> 00:33:11,806
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

922
00:33:11,807 --> 00:33:12,945
(We appreciate the detailed explanation.)

923
00:33:12,946 --> 00:33:14,746
(Busan: The Eastern Palaces)

924
00:33:14,747 --> 00:33:16,645
(Time for Quiz)

925
00:33:16,646 --> 00:33:18,885
Let's now listen to the question.

926
00:33:18,886 --> 00:33:20,256
I'm completely lost.

927
00:33:20,257 --> 00:33:21,316
Appreciating it is one thing,

928
00:33:21,317 --> 00:33:22,326
but you still need to give a correct answer.

929
00:33:22,327 --> 00:33:24,155
- Yes, that's most important.
- Of course.

930
00:33:24,156 --> 00:33:25,856
- I can answer anything you ask.
- That's nice to hear.

931
00:33:26,557 --> 00:33:27,696
Here's your question.

932
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,665
Is it a multiple choice or not?

933
00:33:29,666 --> 00:33:30,666
All I can remember are...

934
00:33:30,667 --> 00:33:31,826
Changdeokgung Palace and Changgyeonggung Palace.

935
00:33:31,827 --> 00:33:33,236
- Same here.
- This...

936
00:33:34,397 --> 00:33:35,966
is a short-answer question that is like a multiple choice question.

937
00:33:37,167 --> 00:33:38,167
What does that mean?

938
00:33:38,168 --> 00:33:40,606
Is it like ordering 1 portion that is like 2?

939
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:42,347
Having 1 portion that is like 2.

940
00:33:42,406 --> 00:33:43,747
A small-sized plate that is like a middle-sized plate.

941
00:33:43,807 --> 00:33:45,206
- Here's your question.
- Sure.

942
00:33:45,207 --> 00:33:46,446
(At least they have good chemistry.)

943
00:33:46,546 --> 00:33:49,186
With the Eastern Palaces, there isn't any information...

944
00:33:49,187 --> 00:33:51,315
regarding the making of the drawing...

945
00:33:51,316 --> 00:33:54,186
which is why we have no way of knowing...

946
00:33:54,187 --> 00:33:57,227
who drew it and why and also when it was specifically drawn.

947
00:33:57,627 --> 00:33:59,525
However, there are things...

948
00:33:59,526 --> 00:34:02,026
that can be assumed by it.

949
00:34:02,627 --> 00:34:06,267
Which season of the year is the drawing set in?

950
00:34:07,937 --> 00:34:10,566
(Let us see.)

951
00:34:10,807 --> 00:34:12,335
We could probably guess...

952
00:34:12,336 --> 00:34:13,877
- by examining it.
- The season?

953
00:34:16,607 --> 00:34:20,747
(Which season is it set in?)

954
00:34:21,417 --> 00:34:22,616
The season?

955
00:34:22,816 --> 00:34:24,186
- It can't be winter.
- From what I can tell...

956
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,516
- The fall?
- I see yellow.

957
00:34:26,517 --> 00:34:30,085
Wouldn't that be the reason why these were colored that way?

958
00:34:30,086 --> 00:34:31,187
(Is this fall foliage?)

959
00:34:31,386 --> 00:34:32,656
Is that a ginkgo tree?

960
00:34:33,756 --> 00:34:35,295
- Then...
- Maybe it's...

961
00:34:35,296 --> 00:34:36,597
- Hold on. What's this?
- The tree?

962
00:34:39,966 --> 00:34:43,106
(Is this an open-book exam?)

963
00:34:43,107 --> 00:34:46,275
It was drawn from January to before the end of August.

964
00:34:46,276 --> 00:34:47,876
- That means it's spring.
- Spring or summer.

965
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:49,446
Is it set in the heart of spring?

966
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,576
(Drawn from January of 1828 to before the end of August of 1830)

967
00:34:52,577 --> 00:34:56,516
It was drawn from January to before the end of August.

968
00:34:56,517 --> 00:34:58,086
Then it must be spring or summer.

969
00:34:58,816 --> 00:35:00,315
It can't be fall or winter.

970
00:35:00,316 --> 00:35:02,886
Our answer can be "between January and August."

971
00:35:03,656 --> 00:35:04,857
They asked for a season.

972
00:35:05,357 --> 00:35:07,127
Must we name the exact season?

973
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:08,655
Of course.

974
00:35:08,656 --> 00:35:10,795
- The season?
- I'll check over there.

975
00:35:10,796 --> 00:35:13,066
- We should study the trees.
- Exactly.

976
00:35:13,966 --> 00:35:15,136
Hey, it's spring.

977
00:35:15,607 --> 00:35:17,365
- Why?
- I see cherry blossoms.

978
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:18,465
- Where?
- Right here.

979
00:35:18,466 --> 00:35:19,706
They're cherry blossoms!

980
00:35:19,707 --> 00:35:22,576
(Flowers have blossomed on unknown trees in the yard.)

981
00:35:22,577 --> 00:35:24,775
(That's huge!)

982
00:35:24,776 --> 00:35:25,776
Nicely done.

983
00:35:26,747 --> 00:35:27,976
- Right.
- They're cherry blossoms.

984
00:35:27,977 --> 00:35:29,945
We can insist that these are cherry blossoms.

985
00:35:29,946 --> 00:35:31,586
(The flowers are in full bloom, so are they right?)

986
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:33,056
(Jin has become the brain of Team Handsome.)

987
00:35:33,057 --> 00:35:34,957
Jin spotted something huge.

988
00:35:35,457 --> 00:35:37,486
This was drawn when it was pretty outside.

989
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:41,326
There are flowers that look like cherry blossoms...

990
00:35:41,327 --> 00:35:44,596
which usually bloom in spring.

991
00:35:44,597 --> 00:35:46,766
It can't be winter judging by the leaves on trees.

992
00:35:46,767 --> 00:35:48,335
- It can't be winter.
- It's not winter.

993
00:35:48,336 --> 00:35:51,306
There are flowers of that color that bloom in the fall,

994
00:35:51,307 --> 00:35:53,275
but since it was drawn between January and August,

995
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,606
- we'll go with spring.
- You scored big time.

996
00:35:55,607 --> 00:35:56,775
We're confident with our answer.

997
00:35:56,776 --> 00:35:58,706
- Are you confident?
- Absolutely.

998
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:00,416
(Their confidence is at 100 percent.)

999
00:36:00,417 --> 00:36:02,077
I'll tell you the answer.

1000
00:36:02,147 --> 00:36:04,646
The season that the Eastern Palaces is set in is...

1001
00:36:04,647 --> 00:36:06,885
(Which season is the Eastern Palaces set in?)

1002
00:36:06,886 --> 00:36:09,086
(Answer: Spring)

1003
00:36:09,092 --> 00:36:10,693
I'll tell you the answer.

1004
00:36:10,923 --> 00:36:13,391
The season that the Eastern Palaces is set in is...

1005
00:36:13,392 --> 00:36:15,562
(Which season is the Eastern Palaces set in?)

1006
00:36:15,563 --> 00:36:17,692
(Answer: Spring)

1007
00:36:17,693 --> 00:36:18,693
- It's spring.
- Yes!

1008
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:21,031
- It's spring.
- Yes!

1009
00:36:21,032 --> 00:36:22,332
(Startled)

1010
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,432
No way.

1011
00:36:23,872 --> 00:36:26,503
(Jumping around)

1012
00:36:27,503 --> 00:36:29,012
My gosh.

1013
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:31,911
- He said it like we got it wrong.
- Yes, exactly.

1014
00:36:31,912 --> 00:36:34,342
- That startled me.
- We're in a museum, so hush.

1015
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:38,412
The season which the Eastern Palaces is set in is early spring.

1016
00:36:39,083 --> 00:36:41,122
- Of course.
- Early spring.

1017
00:36:41,452 --> 00:36:43,792
If they had chosen summer or the fall,

1018
00:36:43,793 --> 00:36:45,692
the trees would've been too thick...

1019
00:36:45,693 --> 00:36:48,192
for the quarters and palaces to be seen properly.

1020
00:36:48,193 --> 00:36:50,531
- You're right.
- If they had chosen the winter,

1021
00:36:50,532 --> 00:36:52,062
the drawing would've been too bleak...

1022
00:36:52,063 --> 00:36:54,362
leaving it aesthetically unpleasing.

1023
00:36:54,363 --> 00:36:56,502
- That's also right.
- Aesthetics are everything.

1024
00:36:56,503 --> 00:36:58,732
The drawing was set to early spring...

1025
00:36:58,733 --> 00:37:00,642
where new life appears in yellow.

1026
00:37:00,972 --> 00:37:02,471
It's a problem being handsome...

1027
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:03,971
when I'm also smart.

1028
00:37:03,972 --> 00:37:06,141
You must be a regular on this show.

1029
00:37:06,142 --> 00:37:07,412
He's still trying to nab me.

1030
00:37:08,012 --> 00:37:09,083
You are correct.

(Team Handsome marks their first space.)

1034
00:37:18,592 --> 00:37:21,592
Good job. Please look at the back of the card.

1035
00:37:21,793 --> 00:37:23,661
- The back?
- There must be something on it.

1036
00:37:23,662 --> 00:37:25,193
(A location card is given to them if they get the right answer.)

1037

(Busan: Raw fish table d'hote)

1039
00:37:30,773 --> 00:37:34,802
(Their meals are as important as the game they'll play.)

1040
00:37:35,673 --> 00:37:37,511
(By getting the answer right, )

1041
00:37:37,512 --> 00:37:42,282
(they will get to eat a staple dish of that region.)

1042
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:46,952
(If they leave that region, they won't be able to eat it.)

1043
00:37:47,552 --> 00:37:52,822
(Are we allowed to ask for food?)

1044
00:37:53,322 --> 00:37:55,322
(Yes, but you can't take any by force.)

1045
00:37:57,432 --> 00:37:59,833
- Raw fish table d'hote in Busan?
- Hold on.

1046
00:38:00,202 --> 00:38:02,773
(Thickly sliced raw fish)

1047
00:38:03,833 --> 00:38:07,742
(How can you be in Busan and not eat this?)

1048
00:38:09,213 --> 00:38:11,112
I had pork and rice soup for breakfast.

1049
00:38:11,113 --> 00:38:12,372
- Did you?
- Really?

1050
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:13,712
(He feels slightly betrayed.)

1051
00:38:13,713 --> 00:38:14,812
Didn't you eat breakfast?

1052
00:38:14,813 --> 00:38:15,951
- I left at the crack of dawn.
- Of course not.

1053
00:38:15,952 --> 00:38:17,153
I haven't eaten since last night.

1054
00:38:17,452 --> 00:38:19,121
We can be offered something more delicious in Changnyeong.

1055
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:21,551
Hold on a second. This is a full-course meal.

1056
00:38:21,552 --> 00:38:22,552
(He can't give up on the raw fish full-course meal.)

1057
00:38:22,553 --> 00:38:24,591
Allow me to voice my opinion.

1058
00:38:24,592 --> 00:38:27,662
Let's say that the others went to Yangsan.

1059
00:38:27,992 --> 00:38:29,431
But without having their meal,

1060
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:30,892
they could go straight to Changnyeong.

1061
00:38:31,432 --> 00:38:33,701
Should that happen, the plan we had...

1062
00:38:33,702 --> 00:38:35,563
could be rendered useless.

1063
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,603
- That's why...
- Do you know what's sweet?

1064
00:38:38,173 --> 00:38:39,503
If we get both in Changnyeong...

1065
00:38:40,742 --> 00:38:42,201
(By scoring both in Changnyeong, they'll block the other team.)

1066
00:38:42,202 --> 00:38:43,673
Them having the center space won't mean a thing.

1067
00:38:44,173 --> 00:38:45,273
This will be their only play.

1068
00:38:45,773 --> 00:38:46,813
- You're right.
- That's true.

1069
00:38:47,012 --> 00:38:49,181
- We should go to Changnyeong.
- That's so smart of you.

1070
00:38:49,182 --> 00:38:50,681
No way. We can just go to Changnyeong.

1071
00:38:50,682 --> 00:38:51,853
What if we don't score there?

1072
00:38:52,253 --> 00:38:54,523
Then the other team will be at a huge advantage.

1073
00:38:56,693 --> 00:38:57,891
We'll use what we have.

1074
00:38:57,892 --> 00:38:59,821
- The reattempt card.
- That's right.

1075
00:38:59,822 --> 00:39:01,792
Let's assume we answer one of them correctly.

1076
00:39:01,793 --> 00:39:03,192
We'll use the reattempt card on the other one.

1077
00:39:03,193 --> 00:39:04,832
Think of this as well.

1078
00:39:04,833 --> 00:39:06,301
Should we do this on our way?

1079
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:08,402
Or should we travel further and then backtrack?

1080
00:39:08,403 --> 00:39:10,531
No, look. We'll go here first and circle like so.

1081
00:39:10,532 --> 00:39:11,801
Should we go to Upo Wetland first?

1082
00:39:11,802 --> 00:39:12,971
We have...

1083
00:39:12,972 --> 00:39:14,141
- to travel downward anyway.
- Should we do that?

1084
00:39:14,142 --> 00:39:15,301
This is on the inside.

1085
00:39:15,302 --> 00:39:16,812
- Okay, then...
- We'll go to Upo Wetland.

1086
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:18,272
Yes, we'll go to Upo Wetland.

1087
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:19,642
(From Busan to Changnyeong)

1088
00:39:20,083 --> 00:39:21,841
- Then we'll...
- This is a battle of wits.

1089
00:39:21,842 --> 00:39:23,011
We'll go to Upo Wetland.

1090
00:39:23,012 --> 00:39:24,511
- Upo Wetland.
- Upo Wetland?

1091
00:39:24,512 --> 00:39:25,712
- Okay.
- We're off to Upo Wetland.

1092
00:39:25,713 --> 00:39:26,721
In 1, 2, 3.

1093
00:39:26,722 --> 00:39:27,722
- Upo Wetland.
- Upo Wetland.

1094
00:39:27,723 --> 00:39:28,781
(Team Guys)

1095
00:39:28,782 --> 00:39:31,052
- I have a good feeling.
- Yes.

1096
00:39:31,853 --> 00:39:34,391
- It feels good to go to Yangsan.
- Right.

1097
00:39:34,392 --> 00:39:35,931
(Yangsang: Tongdosa Temple's Geumgang Ordination Platform)

1098
00:39:35,932 --> 00:39:37,732
The center is the key...

1099
00:39:37,733 --> 00:39:39,502
- in a bingo game.
- Right?

1100
00:39:39,503 --> 00:39:41,562
Why did they make such a choice after winning rock-paper-scissors?

1101
00:39:41,563 --> 00:39:44,072
How stupid! We gave them a chance.

1102
00:39:44,932 --> 00:39:47,201
- It's good for us.
- It's good for us, Tae Hyun.

1103
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:49,342
Therefore, we have to occupy Yangsan.

1104
00:39:51,842 --> 00:39:54,583
We don't hear the sound of "Busan" yet,

1105
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,112
- so they didn't get it right.
- Yes. You're right.

1106
00:39:56,113 --> 00:39:57,312
(Did they fail to get the quiz in Busan?)

1107
00:39:57,313 --> 00:39:58,813
I don't think they're an easy competition, though.

1108
00:39:59,483 --> 00:40:01,782
Tae Hyun, the close location is still far.

1109
00:40:02,653 --> 00:40:05,193
- Yangsan wasn't a close location.
- But...

1110
00:40:05,322 --> 00:40:08,092
- Then, Namhae and Tongyeong are...
- That's right.

1111
00:40:08,563 --> 00:40:09,692
That's frustrating to think.

1112
00:40:09,693 --> 00:40:12,661
No one's thinking about going to Namhae.

1113
00:40:12,662 --> 00:40:14,301
Namhae and Tongyeong are...

1114
00:40:14,302 --> 00:40:17,301
(Cuckoo)

1115
00:40:17,302 --> 00:40:18,532
Busan!

1116
00:40:19,302 --> 00:40:21,472
- "Busan?" Okay.
- They occupied Busan.

1117
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:23,613
They'll put us to sleep now.

1118
00:40:23,673 --> 00:40:24,673
They will.

1119
00:40:24,674 --> 00:40:28,411
Their plan was to arrive there before us.

1120
00:40:28,412 --> 00:40:30,253
We should have hurried.

1121
00:40:30,483 --> 00:40:32,412
It's a 30-minute nap.

1122
00:40:33,182 --> 00:40:35,052
We don't have much time, then.

1123
00:40:35,253 --> 00:40:37,122
Will they be 30 minutes ahead of us?

1124
00:40:37,423 --> 00:40:39,091
Well, they can't go that fast.

1125
00:40:39,092 --> 00:40:42,063
We were stuck in the morning traffic.

1126
00:40:42,423 --> 00:40:44,392
- They got Busan.
- Yes.

1127
00:40:44,492 --> 00:40:46,863
- But they're not making us sleep.
- Right.

1128
00:40:47,003 --> 00:40:48,761
That means they're sending us to Yangsan,

1129
00:40:48,762 --> 00:40:50,572
saying, "You can go to Yangsan."

1130
00:40:51,202 --> 00:40:53,801
I think they're heading to Yongseondae in Changnyeong now.

1131
00:40:53,802 --> 00:40:54,943
- That's possible.
- Yes.

1132
00:40:55,043 --> 00:40:57,871
I'm sure they'll climb the mountain in Changnyeong.

1133
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:58,872
(They'll choose Yongseondae without a doubt.)

1134
00:40:59,282 --> 00:41:01,242
Otherwise, they have to go to Namhae.

1135
00:41:02,113 --> 00:41:03,113
That's right.

1136
00:41:03,114 --> 00:41:04,652
- In 1, 2, 3, Upo Wetland.
- Upo Wetland.

1137
00:41:04,653 --> 00:41:06,552
(That's wrong.)

1138
00:41:07,182 --> 00:41:08,482
They won't go there.

1139
00:41:08,483 --> 00:41:11,152
- They'll go hiking first.
- That's true.

1140
00:41:11,153 --> 00:41:12,292
(While they are guessing wrong in a logical way...)

1141
00:41:12,293 --> 00:41:14,092
(Team Handsome)

1142
00:41:15,592 --> 00:41:16,793
Who'll drive? Rock-paper-scissors?

1143
00:41:17,392 --> 00:41:18,892
- I'm okay to drive.
- Really?

1144
00:41:20,302 --> 00:41:22,802
- Goodness.
- Gosh.

1145
00:41:23,202 --> 00:41:25,403
Excluding Sang Uk, you and I are groaning.

1146
00:41:25,673 --> 00:41:27,603
(The youngest one is fine.)

1147
00:41:28,903 --> 00:41:30,713
Look. Let's see how long it takes.

1148
00:41:30,943 --> 00:41:32,571
I think it'll take an hour and a half.

1149
00:41:32,572 --> 00:41:33,681
Upo Wetland.

1150
00:41:33,682 --> 00:41:35,383
(The distance to Upo Wetland: 1 hour 50 minutes away)

1151
00:41:35,742 --> 00:41:38,212
An hour and 50 minutes? Gosh. It's far, indeed.

1152
00:41:38,213 --> 00:41:40,652
- We have to eat when we get there.
- An hour and 50 minutes?

1153
00:41:40,653 --> 00:41:42,793
Yes. Let's eat when we get there.

1154
00:41:43,622 --> 00:41:48,221
(They have to get the quiz right to fill up their empty stomachs.)

1155
00:41:48,222 --> 00:41:50,633
Raw fish sounded really good.

1156
00:41:50,693 --> 00:41:51,892
We could have had it,

1157
00:41:52,333 --> 00:41:54,463
but if the other team leaves without eating,

1158
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:56,301
we might...

1159
00:41:56,302 --> 00:41:57,872
go home tomorrow.

1160
00:41:58,572 --> 00:42:00,142
That can happen.

1161
00:42:00,543 --> 00:42:03,071
Should I call Dong Hyun?

1162
00:42:03,072 --> 00:42:05,712
Yes. We think they're on their way to Yangsan.

1163
00:42:05,713 --> 00:42:06,842
Right.

1164
00:42:07,443 --> 00:42:08,812
Kim Dong Hyun.

1165
00:42:08,813 --> 00:42:11,853
(Calling Dong Hyun)

1166
00:42:13,253 --> 00:42:14,382
Yes?

1167
00:42:14,383 --> 00:42:15,483
Hello?

1168
00:42:16,353 --> 00:42:17,621
- It's Jin on the phone.
- Hey, Dong Hyun.

1169
00:42:17,622 --> 00:42:18,722
Hello.

1170
00:42:18,793 --> 00:42:20,491
We heard the news.

1171
00:42:20,492 --> 00:42:22,261
What news?

1172
00:42:22,262 --> 00:42:23,732
We heard the alarm.

1173
00:42:23,733 --> 00:42:25,431
- Busan.
- We heard you occupied Busan.

1174
00:42:25,432 --> 00:42:27,102
We just stopped by it on our way to Yangsan.

1175
00:42:27,103 --> 00:42:28,403
We just stopped by.

1176
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:31,503
I knew you'd play cheap from the beginning.

1177
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:33,341
It was because...

1178
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,042
How could we miss it when it's ten minutes away?

1179
00:42:35,043 --> 00:42:36,673
- It was on our way.
- Come on.

1180
00:42:36,742 --> 00:42:39,112
Sure. We didn't believe you.

1181
00:42:39,113 --> 00:42:41,542
- And we were right.
- Are you ready to take a nap?

1182
00:42:41,543 --> 00:42:42,641
What?

1183
00:42:42,642 --> 00:42:44,682
Are you ready to take a nap?

1184
00:42:45,083 --> 00:42:46,982
(Right now?)

1185
00:42:46,983 --> 00:42:48,653
Right now, we are...

1186
00:42:49,282 --> 00:42:50,821
- We're okay so far.
- Really?

1187
00:42:50,822 --> 00:42:52,862
If you're sleepy, should we use it now?

1188
00:42:52,863 --> 00:42:54,462
- We're good now.
- Now, it's...

1189
00:42:54,463 --> 00:42:56,832
- We're almost done eating.
- I see.

1190
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:59,833
- We'll get sleepy after the meal.
- We...

1191
00:43:00,103 --> 00:43:01,701
Let's be humane,

1192
00:43:01,702 --> 00:43:03,903
and let us sleep after we got at least one quiz right.

1193
00:43:04,302 --> 00:43:06,371
(The veteran actor takes a submissive attitude.)

1194
00:43:06,372 --> 00:43:08,641
You sound tired right now.

1195
00:43:08,642 --> 00:43:10,842
We're not sleepy at all.

1196
00:43:11,642 --> 00:43:13,443
We just placed an order for lunch.

1197
00:43:13,543 --> 00:43:15,341
We just ordered it.

1198
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,511
Stop talking about the meal when it's not there.

1199
00:43:17,512 --> 00:43:20,182
Come on. Let us finish our meal.

1200
00:43:20,523 --> 00:43:23,292
Dong Hyun keeps talking gibberish.

1201
00:43:23,293 --> 00:43:25,821
But I'll tell you exactly what's going on.

1202
00:43:25,822 --> 00:43:29,562
Let us take a quiz in Changnyeong.

1203
00:43:29,563 --> 00:43:32,362
- We'll let you have Yangsan.
- Okay.

1204
00:43:32,363 --> 00:43:34,761
You stole Busan from us. Don't you feel sorry for us?

1205
00:43:34,762 --> 00:43:36,902
- We'll let you have Busan.
- Dong Hyun.

1206
00:43:36,903 --> 00:43:39,071
When you speak, it's so obvious you're lying.

1207
00:43:39,072 --> 00:43:40,241
(Dong Hyun, we can tell that you're lying.)

1208
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,471
- We can tell when you speak.
- What?

1209
00:43:42,472 --> 00:43:43,612
Tell what?

1210
00:43:43,613 --> 00:43:45,712
I'll keep quiet from now on.

1211
00:43:45,713 --> 00:43:46,943
- Seung Ho, you speak.
- Right.

1212
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,442
Actually,

1213
00:43:48,443 --> 00:43:50,852
I didn't say a word on purpose.

1214
00:43:50,853 --> 00:43:52,011
Dong Hyun...

1215
00:43:52,012 --> 00:43:53,622
doesn't know where we're going.

1216
00:43:54,552 --> 00:43:55,621
(That somehow sounds reasonable.)

1217
00:43:55,622 --> 00:43:56,991
- He's just...
- I'm just...

1218
00:43:56,992 --> 00:43:58,891
He's just driving...

1219
00:43:58,892 --> 00:44:00,862
because there's a road ahead of him.

1220
00:44:00,863 --> 00:44:01,992
Whatever.

1221
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:03,632
Just get ready to sleep.

1222
00:44:03,633 --> 00:44:04,733
- What?
- What? No.

1223
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:06,332
Come on, Yi Kyung.

1224
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:08,332
- Wait a second.
- Then, tell us one thing.

1225
00:44:08,333 --> 00:44:10,132
Good night.

1226
00:44:10,133 --> 00:44:12,572
Wait, Yi Kyung. Okay. Hold on.

1227
00:44:12,842 --> 00:44:14,102
Then...

1228
00:44:14,103 --> 00:44:16,612
If you tell us where you're going, we won't make you sleep.

1229
00:44:16,613 --> 00:44:18,472
- Okay. That sounds good.
- What?

1230
00:44:19,443 --> 00:44:20,542
Changnyeong!

1231
00:44:20,543 --> 00:44:21,612
Yangsan!

1232
00:44:21,613 --> 00:44:23,012
(Lying and faking)

1233
00:44:23,613 --> 00:44:25,452
- Yangnyeong!
- They're going two ways.

1234
00:44:25,613 --> 00:44:26,752
It's Yangsan.

1235
00:44:26,753 --> 00:44:28,883
- Yangsan, a perfect place to sleep.
- We...

1236
00:44:29,153 --> 00:44:31,022
We don't lie.

1237
00:44:31,023 --> 00:44:32,523
We're being honest.

1238
00:44:32,552 --> 00:44:34,423
- Good night.
- What?

1239
00:44:35,492 --> 00:44:36,963
(He hangs up.)

1240
00:44:37,492 --> 00:44:39,261
- They're going to Yangsan, right?
- Yes.

1241
00:44:39,262 --> 00:44:41,701
- They want to win the center first.
- They're lying...

1242
00:44:41,702 --> 00:44:43,072
about Changnyeong.

1243
00:44:44,032 --> 00:44:46,871
Gosh. Let us go there.

1244
00:44:46,872 --> 00:44:48,942
- Let us ring the bell once.
- Tae Hyun.

1245
00:44:48,943 --> 00:44:50,741
We're already here.

1246
00:44:50,742 --> 00:44:51,871
(We're almost there.)

1247
00:44:51,872 --> 00:44:53,012
(Parking lot)

1248
00:44:57,613 --> 00:44:58,753
We are here.

1249
00:44:58,853 --> 00:45:00,222
Thanks for driving.

1250
00:45:04,353 --> 00:45:07,622
(A temple located in Mount Yeongchuk with a great mountain range)

1251
00:45:11,693 --> 00:45:15,363
(Tongdosa Temple in Yangsan)

1252
00:45:15,603 --> 00:45:21,503
(What will the national heritage here look like?)

1253
00:45:22,773 --> 00:45:25,273

(Handsome heritage 2: The temple with real Buddha)

1255
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,653
It's so nice here.

1256
00:45:30,653 --> 00:45:32,682
It looks amazing here.

1257
00:45:33,182 --> 00:45:35,782
Isn't Tongdosa Temple really famous?

1258
00:45:35,853 --> 00:45:36,952
Right?

1259
00:45:37,452 --> 00:45:39,023
- It's really big.
- Yes.

1260
00:45:39,092 --> 00:45:40,262
It's so pretty.

1261
00:45:43,133 --> 00:45:44,492
There's a monk.

1262
00:45:46,063 --> 00:45:47,261
(A monk welcomes Team Guys.)

1263
00:45:47,262 --> 00:45:49,063
- Hello.
- Hello.

1264
00:45:49,202 --> 00:45:51,733
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1265
00:45:52,173 --> 00:45:55,942
I'm the chief of propagation in Tongdosa Temple.

1266
00:45:55,943 --> 00:45:57,071
I'm Monk Su Jin.

1267
00:45:57,072 --> 00:45:58,511
- "Monk Su Jin." - Hello.

1268
00:45:58,512 --> 00:46:00,943
- My daughter is Su Jin too.
- Right.

1269
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:03,281
As for Tongdosa Temple,

1270
00:46:03,282 --> 00:46:05,951
it's the largest temple in Korea. So...

1271
00:46:05,952 --> 00:46:07,551
- Is it the largest?
- Yes, it is.

1272
00:46:07,552 --> 00:46:09,482
- I see.
- That's amazing.

1273
00:46:09,483 --> 00:46:12,552
There are three great temples in Korea.

1274
00:46:12,653 --> 00:46:14,562
They are called the Three Jewels Temples.

1275
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,591
- Three...
- "The Three Jewels Temples?"

1276
00:46:15,592 --> 00:46:16,662
Three Jewels?

1277
00:46:17,633 --> 00:46:19,431
(Three Jewels)

1278
00:46:19,432 --> 00:46:21,963
There are the three great jewels in Buddhism.

1279
00:46:22,903 --> 00:46:24,733
Buddha, Dharma,

1280
00:46:25,072 --> 00:46:27,372
and monks. Those are the Three Jewels.

1281
00:46:28,472 --> 00:46:30,071
The temple symbolizing the Buddha's teaching...

1282
00:46:30,072 --> 00:46:31,842
is the one with the Tripitaka Koreana,

1283
00:46:32,213 --> 00:46:33,582
which is Haeinsa Temple.

1284
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:35,841
(Dharma Jewel Temple, Haeinsa Temple)

1285
00:46:35,842 --> 00:46:38,482
Nineteen monks acted as the advisors for the king.

1286
00:46:38,483 --> 00:46:40,222
The temple they were from...

1287
00:46:40,253 --> 00:46:41,951
was Songgwangsa Temple, so it's the temple of the monks.

1288
00:46:41,952 --> 00:46:43,193
(Sangha temple, Songgwangsa Temple)

1289
00:46:43,452 --> 00:46:45,522
As for Tongdosa Temple, we represent the most important,

1290
00:46:45,523 --> 00:46:46,891
the Buddha.

1291
00:46:46,892 --> 00:46:48,822
(The Buddha!)

1292
00:46:49,193 --> 00:46:53,863
(The real Buddha's sarira is preserved in Tongdosa Temple.)

1293
00:46:54,063 --> 00:46:56,602
The Buddha sits in Tongdosa Temple.

1294
00:46:56,603 --> 00:46:59,031
He watches us himself.

1295
00:46:59,032 --> 00:47:00,071
It's Jewel Temple representing the Buddha.

1296
00:47:00,072 --> 00:47:02,301
It's the temple of the Buddha.

1297
00:47:02,302 --> 00:47:04,071
(Buddha Jewel Temple, Tongdosa Temple)

1298
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:05,741
(Amazed)

1299
00:47:05,742 --> 00:47:07,812
We'll go inside...

1300
00:47:07,813 --> 00:47:09,241
and see how it looks.

1301
00:47:09,242 --> 00:47:10,252
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1302
00:47:10,253 --> 00:47:11,353
- Shall we?
- Yes.

1303
00:47:12,883 --> 00:47:16,022
Because Tongdosa Temple is big and famous,

1304
00:47:16,023 --> 00:47:18,891
it's the head family of Buddhism.

1305
00:47:18,892 --> 00:47:21,292
It's the big temple in the country.

1306
00:47:21,293 --> 00:47:22,962
Those are what...

1307
00:47:22,963 --> 00:47:25,063
those signs were saying.

1308
00:47:25,563 --> 00:47:27,902
Head family of Buddhism and the great temple of the country.

1309
00:47:27,903 --> 00:47:29,871
I'll memorize that it's the head family of Buddhism.

1310
00:47:29,872 --> 00:47:31,272
Why are you memorizing that?

1311
00:47:31,273 --> 00:47:32,832
- Great temple of the country.
- You memorize that.

1312
00:47:32,833 --> 00:47:33,971
It's the great temple of the country.

1313
00:47:33,972 --> 00:47:36,812
- It's the head family.
- The largest Tongdosa Temple.

1314
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:38,841
In front of us...

1315
00:47:38,842 --> 00:47:41,543
is the gate called Cheonwangmun.

1316
00:47:41,713 --> 00:47:44,512
The Cheonwangmun acts as a security office.

1317
00:47:44,753 --> 00:47:47,282
It prevents the evil people from coming in.

1318
00:47:48,923 --> 00:47:50,022
Look to the left.

1319
00:47:50,023 --> 00:47:52,091
It's the deity that guards the south.

1320
00:47:52,092 --> 00:47:54,422
They guard the four directions, including the north.

1321
00:47:54,423 --> 00:47:55,491
You memorize those two.

1322
00:47:55,492 --> 00:47:57,092
(Laughing)

1323
00:47:57,133 --> 00:47:59,363
- It can be on the quiz.
- Can it?

1324
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:00,963
Gwangmok-cheonwang.

1325
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:02,432
The west is Gwangmok-cheonwang.

1326
00:48:02,662 --> 00:48:03,701
The north is "Da."

1327
00:48:03,702 --> 00:48:04,773
(They keep memorizing without a reason.)

1328
00:48:05,403 --> 00:48:06,602
Come on.

1329
00:48:06,603 --> 00:48:07,971
- Jeungjang-cheonwang.
- The north is "Da."

1330
00:48:07,972 --> 00:48:09,102
All they care about is the quiz.

1331
00:48:09,103 --> 00:48:10,341
The head family of Buddhism.

1332
00:48:10,342 --> 00:48:11,572
The east is "Ji."

1333
00:48:12,072 --> 00:48:13,113
Jiguk-cheonwang.

1334
00:48:13,282 --> 00:48:14,682
The north is Damun-cheonwang.

1335
00:48:15,242 --> 00:48:16,583
The north is "Da," and the east is "Ji."

1336
00:48:16,653 --> 00:48:18,452
Jeung, Gwang, Da, Ji.

1337
00:48:18,782 --> 00:48:19,951
I'll listen to him from here.

1338
00:48:19,952 --> 00:48:22,452
We have to study it,

1339
00:48:22,523 --> 00:48:23,952
so we should listen to him closer.

1340
00:48:24,353 --> 00:48:25,853
What? This is...

1341
00:48:26,423 --> 00:48:27,661
You can have them.

1342
00:48:27,662 --> 00:48:29,391
They said it was okay to have the free food.

1343
00:48:29,392 --> 00:48:30,432
Tae Hyun.

1344
00:48:30,932 --> 00:48:33,063
- It's okay to eat the free food.
- Free food is okay, right?

1345
00:48:33,603 --> 00:48:35,431
- Free foods are okay to take.
- We can get the free food.

1346
00:48:35,432 --> 00:48:37,871
- We have to cheer up.
- That's right.

1347
00:48:37,872 --> 00:48:39,032
Let's take a few.

1348
00:48:39,302 --> 00:48:40,701
- Can I take a few?
- Yes.

1349
00:48:40,702 --> 00:48:42,471
- About three?
- Sure.

1350
00:48:42,472 --> 00:48:44,072
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

1351
00:48:44,773 --> 00:48:46,173
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1352
00:48:47,113 --> 00:48:48,282
Thank you.

1353
00:48:49,512 --> 00:48:52,212
Sir, can we have these?

1354
00:48:52,213 --> 00:48:53,622
- Yes. You can have those.
- Thank you.

1355
00:48:53,853 --> 00:48:55,353
(Putting in his mouth)

1356
00:48:55,983 --> 00:48:57,051
(Now that they stole some sugary treat...)

1357
00:48:57,052 --> 00:48:59,122
They said it was okay to get the free food, and there it was.

1358
00:49:00,463 --> 00:49:02,722
Now, we'll go to the Geumgang Ordination Platform...

1359
00:49:02,793 --> 00:49:04,891
- where the Buddha is.
- Geumgang Ordination Platform.

1360
00:49:04,892 --> 00:49:06,903
- Geumgang Ordination Platform?
- That's right.

1361
00:49:09,833 --> 00:49:13,503
(When you go deep into Tongdosa Temple, )

1362
00:49:14,603 --> 00:49:18,642
(you encounter a building that is the heart of the temple.)

1363
00:49:19,142 --> 00:49:23,352
(National Treasure, Daeungjeon)

1364
00:49:23,353 --> 00:49:26,411
- This is the Daeungjeon.
- The Daeungjeon.

1365
00:49:26,412 --> 00:49:28,382
There's Daeungjeon in every temple.

1366
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:29,551
That's right.

1367
00:49:29,552 --> 00:49:31,591
In fact, at the Daeungjeon in Tongdosa Temple,

1368
00:49:31,592 --> 00:49:35,363
the stonework on the bottom is from the Silla Dynasty.

1369
00:49:35,662 --> 00:49:36,962
But the wooden building on top of it got burnt down...

1370
00:49:36,963 --> 00:49:38,293
during the Japanese invasions of Korea.

1371
00:49:38,633 --> 00:49:40,801
It was rebuilt during King Injo's rule.

1372
00:49:40,802 --> 00:49:43,233
Since then, it has remained like this.

1373
00:49:44,072 --> 00:49:45,132
That stone is...

1374
00:49:45,133 --> 00:49:46,571
- hundreds of years old.
- Right.

1375
00:49:46,572 --> 00:49:48,872
It's old because it was there since the Silla Dynasty.

1376
00:49:49,242 --> 00:49:50,943
It's more than 1,300 years old.

1377
00:49:52,242 --> 00:49:54,181
- It's pretty.
- It's amazing.

1378
00:49:54,182 --> 00:49:55,341
(And...)

1379
00:49:55,342 --> 00:49:58,051
And you see a stone structure in front of you.

1380
00:49:58,052 --> 00:50:00,153
(Another national treasure behind the Daeungjeon)

1381
00:50:01,423 --> 00:50:02,653
That's the Geumgang Ordination Platform.

1382
00:50:04,193 --> 00:50:09,892
(National treasure, Geumgang Ordination Platform)

1383
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,002
(The Geumgang Ordination Platform in Tongdosa Temple)

1384
00:50:14,003 --> 00:50:15,661
(Selected as the national treasure in 1997 with the Daeungjeon)

1385
00:50:15,662 --> 00:50:17,531
(Repaired many times through the Goryeo and the Joseon Dynasty)

1386
00:50:17,532 --> 00:50:19,201
(It has the traditional structure of Korean ordination platform.)

1387
00:50:19,202 --> 00:50:22,141
To be exact, the tower in the middle is called stupa.

1388
00:50:22,142 --> 00:50:23,972
(The stupa that looks like a bell)

1389
00:50:24,713 --> 00:50:26,241
The platform that bears the stupa...

1390
00:50:26,242 --> 00:50:27,781
is called the Geumgang Ordination Platform.

1391
00:50:27,782 --> 00:50:30,281
The whole thing is called Geumgang Ordination Platform?

1392
00:50:30,282 --> 00:50:31,313
That's right.

1393
00:50:31,452 --> 00:50:32,952
- So...
- That platform.

1394
00:50:33,383 --> 00:50:35,382
Ordination is to follow the precept.

1395
00:50:35,383 --> 00:50:36,422
The precept?

1396
00:50:36,423 --> 00:50:40,761
You have to follow the precept to become a monk.

1397
00:50:40,762 --> 00:50:41,963
(The ritual to become a monk is ordination.)

1398
00:50:42,423 --> 00:50:45,761
It's called the ordination platform because you become monks here.

1399
00:50:45,762 --> 00:50:47,563
(Geumgang Ordination Platform, the platform to get ordination)

1400
00:50:47,802 --> 00:50:51,833
Geumgang means diamonds.

1401
00:50:52,202 --> 00:50:54,942
With the hope that precept won't break like diamonds,

1402
00:50:54,943 --> 00:50:57,241
it's called the Geumgang Ordination Platform.

1403
00:50:57,242 --> 00:50:58,673
(It's named so that the precept stays strong like diamonds.)

1404
00:50:59,543 --> 00:51:01,141
- It's the whole thing?
- Yes.

1405
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:02,782
That's the Geumgang Ordination Platform.

1406
00:51:04,153 --> 00:51:07,681
(The significance of the Geumgang Ordination Platform)

1407
00:51:07,682 --> 00:51:11,222
They say the Buddha's sarira is in the stupa.

1408
00:51:11,353 --> 00:51:13,491
The stupa in Tongdosa Temple...

1409
00:51:13,492 --> 00:51:15,193
has an actual sarira in it.

1410
00:51:15,423 --> 00:51:17,092
So, it's called true body sarira.

1411
00:51:17,233 --> 00:51:20,363
It's sarira from a true body.

1412
00:51:20,532 --> 00:51:21,902
- True...
- True body sarira.

1413
00:51:21,903 --> 00:51:24,402
- True body sarira. The real body.
- Yes.

1414
00:51:24,403 --> 00:51:26,233
It means true body.

1415
00:51:27,372 --> 00:51:30,943
Jajang Yulsa went to China himself.

1416
00:51:31,872 --> 00:51:33,482
(When Jajang Yulsa was praying in the Tang Dynasty, )

1417
00:51:33,483 --> 00:51:35,141
(Manjusri gave him 100 true body sarira and a robe...)

1418
00:51:35,142 --> 00:51:36,682
(of the Buddha.)

1419
00:51:37,083 --> 00:51:39,982
He sealed the sarira from India here.

1420
00:51:39,983 --> 00:51:41,221
(The sarira of the Buddha was brought and separated...)

1421
00:51:41,222 --> 00:51:42,252
(in three bell-shaped stupas in Hwangnyongsa Temple's pagoda, )

1422
00:51:42,253 --> 00:51:43,292
(Daehwasa Temple's pagoda, )

1423
00:51:43,293 --> 00:51:44,353
(and Tongdosa Temple's ordination platform.)

1424
00:51:46,023 --> 00:51:48,292
(Thanks to the Geumgang Ordination Platform, )

1425
00:51:48,293 --> 00:51:50,732
(the Tongdosa Temple's Daeungjeon has something different.)

1426
00:51:50,733 --> 00:51:53,661
Actually, all Daeungjeon and Buddhist buildings...

1427
00:51:53,662 --> 00:51:56,202
have a statue of the Buddha in the middle.

1428
00:51:57,103 --> 00:51:59,471
(Generally, )

1429
00:51:59,472 --> 00:52:04,571
(the statue of the Buddha is located in Daeungjeon.)

1430
00:52:04,572 --> 00:52:05,872
When you look closely,

1431
00:52:06,173 --> 00:52:08,442
there's no statue of the Buddha in our Daeungjeon.

1432
00:52:08,443 --> 00:52:09,483
No, there isn't one.

1433
00:52:11,483 --> 00:52:15,423
(You don't see the statue of Buddha at Tongdosa Temple's Daeungjeon.)

1434
00:52:15,682 --> 00:52:18,852
(Why didn't they put the statue?)

1435
00:52:18,853 --> 00:52:20,192
Here's the reason.

1436
00:52:20,193 --> 00:52:22,463
It's because we believe the real Buddha himself...

1437
00:52:22,563 --> 00:52:25,891
sits in the middle of the Geumgang Ordination Platform.

1438
00:52:25,892 --> 00:52:27,362
There's no need to put a statue modeled after him...

1439
00:52:27,363 --> 00:52:29,863
when the real self is sitting there.

1440
00:52:30,302 --> 00:52:33,972
That's why there's no statue in there.

1441
00:52:34,372 --> 00:52:36,301
There's only a window where people can see through.

1442
00:52:36,302 --> 00:52:37,773
- That's how it was built.
- That's right.

1443
00:52:39,412 --> 00:52:43,182
(The Daeungjeon is structured so that you can see the Buddha.)

1444
00:52:44,153 --> 00:52:48,122
(It's a significant and religious space for the Buddhists.)

1445
00:52:49,682 --> 00:52:52,352
(Even the non believers can see the historical importance...)

1446
00:52:52,353 --> 00:52:56,262
(of the Daeungjeon and the Geumgang Ordination Platform.)

1447
00:52:59,733 --> 00:53:02,931
Sir, you said the tower there...

1448
00:53:02,932 --> 00:53:04,632
- was called a stupa.
- Yes.

1449
00:53:04,633 --> 00:53:06,272
Is it a stupa or stuppa?

1450
00:53:06,273 --> 00:53:08,102
Stupa.

1451
00:53:08,103 --> 00:53:09,673
It's a stupa with one P.

1452
00:53:09,872 --> 00:53:11,841
(He got it completely.)

1453
00:53:11,842 --> 00:53:13,172
It seems we can't go in there?

1454
00:53:13,173 --> 00:53:15,483
You can go in only on special occasions.

1455
00:53:16,642 --> 00:53:19,112
(We'll go close to it and look since we can't get inside.)

1456
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:20,923
Gosh. That's how it looks.

1457
00:53:21,083 --> 00:53:23,923
It's not stairs. It's a platform.

1458
00:53:24,592 --> 00:53:25,752
It's a platform.

1459
00:53:25,753 --> 00:53:27,192
(You can feel how magnificent it is up close.)

1460
00:53:27,193 --> 00:53:28,523
It's a platform.

1461
00:53:29,592 --> 00:53:31,991
I thought it was stairs, but it was not.

1462
00:53:31,992 --> 00:53:33,702
- It's a platform.
- Right.

1463
00:53:34,133 --> 00:53:35,701
(They felt the holiness of the Geumgang Ordination Platform...)

1464
00:53:35,702 --> 00:53:37,301
(though it was only for a short moment.)

1465
00:53:37,302 --> 00:53:39,402
Thank you, Monk Su Jin.

1466
00:53:39,403 --> 00:53:41,542
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Goodbye.

1467
00:53:41,543 --> 00:53:42,543
Thank you.

1468
00:53:42,544 --> 00:53:44,772
By the way, when's your birthday?

1469
00:53:44,773 --> 00:53:46,172
My birthday? It's July 4.

1470
00:53:46,173 --> 00:53:48,212
- I see. Thank you.
- Sure.

1471
00:53:48,213 --> 00:53:49,882
- Thank you.
- That was...

1472
00:53:49,883 --> 00:53:53,012
Is there a monk whose birthday is this week?

1473
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,752
- I don't know about that.
- Okay.

1474
00:53:55,753 --> 00:53:56,951
- Okay.
- Bye.

1475
00:53:56,952 --> 00:53:57,991
Thank you.

1476
00:53:57,992 --> 00:54:01,292
(Team Guys finishes touring Tongdosa Temple.)

1477
00:54:01,293 --> 00:54:03,833
(Team Handsome, West Busan)

1478
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:07,332
(Are they getting off at a resting area all of a sudden?)

1479
00:54:07,333 --> 00:54:08,802
We can only buy drinks, right?

1480
00:54:08,903 --> 00:54:10,832
- You can only buy liquid drinks.
- It's right here.

1481
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:12,003
- Liquids.
- Liquids.

1482
00:54:12,673 --> 00:54:14,102
Can I buy two since you're buying?

1483
00:54:14,103 --> 00:54:15,701
Yes. Drink as much as you want.

1484
00:54:15,702 --> 00:54:16,742
Gosh. Jin is buying.

1485
00:54:16,912 --> 00:54:18,712
- Get all you want.
- Do I get to see the black card?

1486
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:20,282
I should mark this on my calendar.

1487
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,741
"The day Jin bought me an iced tea."

1488
00:54:22,742 --> 00:54:24,512
- I'll get the iced tea.
- Grande.

1489
00:54:25,483 --> 00:54:27,522
(You're buying, right?)

1490
00:54:27,523 --> 00:54:28,583
Thank you.

1491
00:54:30,622 --> 00:54:31,793
Jin is buying.

1492
00:54:32,622 --> 00:54:34,063
Everyone, Jin is buying.

1493
00:54:34,423 --> 00:54:35,923
What's so important?

1494
00:54:36,322 --> 00:54:38,333
Gosh. His wallet is Gucci.

1495
00:54:39,293 --> 00:54:41,932
(He buys them drinks with a luxurious heart.)

1496
00:54:42,233 --> 00:54:43,362
They don't have it.

1497
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,732
(Waiting for the drinks)

1498
00:54:44,733 --> 00:54:46,233
Hello. He is Jin of BTS.

1499
00:54:46,532 --> 00:54:47,543
I see.

1500
00:54:47,943 --> 00:54:50,072
- Do you know me?
- Don't you know Jin of BTS?

1501
00:54:50,142 --> 00:54:52,273
He's acting. He knows him, of course.

1502
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:53,682
You know who he is, right?

1503
00:54:55,012 --> 00:54:56,883
(Confused)

1504
00:54:57,153 --> 00:54:58,511
He's Kim Dong Hyun.

1505
00:54:58,512 --> 00:54:59,753
(Kim Dong Hyun, the UFC fighter)

1506
00:55:00,952 --> 00:55:03,722
(Swordsman Kim Dong Hyun is good with punches too.)

1507
00:55:04,122 --> 00:55:05,692
Let me know if you want to dislocate your bones.

1508
00:55:05,693 --> 00:55:06,991
(Free manual therapy)

1509
00:55:06,992 --> 00:55:08,321
I guess he doesn't watch TV.

1510
00:55:08,322 --> 00:55:09,522
(Comforting him)

1511
00:55:09,523 --> 00:55:11,233
- He doesn't watch TV.
- That's right.

1512
00:55:12,662 --> 00:55:14,633
- Here they are.
- Thank you.

1513
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:16,503
- The sweet potato one.
- Iced tea.

1514
00:55:17,233 --> 00:55:19,732
Our staff, are you okay without a drink?

1515
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:22,542
I can buy you a drink if you want.

1516
00:55:22,543 --> 00:55:24,071
- Really?
- No way.

1517
00:55:24,072 --> 00:55:25,542
We can order it...

1518
00:55:25,543 --> 00:55:27,082
- if you're okay with the time.
- We're fine.

1519
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:28,642
Then we have to wait 20 minutes...

1520
00:55:28,842 --> 00:55:30,353
- for the drinks to come out.
- Let's go.

1521
00:55:30,782 --> 00:55:31,812
(We almost thought World-Wide Handsome bought us a drink.)

1522
00:55:31,813 --> 00:55:33,113
We have to keep moving.

1523
00:55:34,452 --> 00:55:35,622
I can feel the sugar going in.

1524
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:37,551
My chin just throbbed.

1525
00:55:37,552 --> 00:55:39,052
(They do have a long way to go.)

1526
00:55:39,153 --> 00:55:40,522
(Team Guys)

1527
00:55:40,523 --> 00:55:41,862
There is so much to memorize.

1528
00:55:41,863 --> 00:55:44,562
We have no idea what the quiz will be about.

1529
00:55:44,563 --> 00:55:45,832
- It's so hard.
- There's so much to memorize.

1530
00:55:45,833 --> 00:55:46,902
It's so hard.

1531
00:55:46,903 --> 00:55:48,362
(They found Monk Su Jin.)

1532
00:55:48,363 --> 00:55:50,372
Monk Su Jin, was it Daebangbangjeon?

1533
00:55:51,072 --> 00:55:52,402
What were the names...

1534
00:55:52,403 --> 00:55:54,272
of the four deities?

1535
00:55:54,273 --> 00:55:55,472
The names of them?

1536
00:55:56,302 --> 00:55:58,272
- What?
- They are...

1537
00:55:58,273 --> 00:55:59,641
- Jeungjang.
- Jeungjang-cheonwang.

1538
00:55:59,642 --> 00:56:01,982
They're cramming for the quiz.

1539
00:56:01,983 --> 00:56:03,551
- Dabo-cheonwang?
- Didn't they say Dabo?

1540
00:56:03,552 --> 00:56:04,911
- Pyunggyeong-cheonwang?
- Damun-cheonwang.

1541
00:56:04,912 --> 00:56:06,051
- Damun-cheonwang?
- Jiguk-cheonwang.

1542
00:56:06,052 --> 00:56:07,483
- Jeungjang-cheonwang.
- Jeungjang-cheonwang.

1543
00:56:07,653 --> 00:56:09,083
What was the last one?

1544
00:56:09,383 --> 00:56:10,653
Memorize them.

1545
00:56:11,153 --> 00:56:13,192
We're in trouble. He won't tell us the last one.

1546
00:56:13,193 --> 00:56:14,363
I think this is the quiz.

1547
00:56:15,392 --> 00:56:16,792
- I don't know.
- Can we study more?

1548
00:56:16,793 --> 00:56:17,793
- Yes, you can.
- Go ahead.

1549
00:56:17,794 --> 00:56:19,031
Come on. Let's go. Where?

1550
00:56:19,032 --> 00:56:21,031
- I'll check the deities.
- Will you?

1551
00:56:21,032 --> 00:56:22,403
I'll check the deities.

1552
00:56:22,762 --> 00:56:23,833
Damun-cheonwang.

1553
00:56:24,372 --> 00:56:25,472
Jiguk-cheonwang.

1554
00:56:26,173 --> 00:56:27,841
Damun-cheonwang.

1555
00:56:27,842 --> 00:56:29,371
- Gwangmok-cheonwang.
- Damun.

1556
00:56:29,372 --> 00:56:31,042
This is how I memorize things.

1557
00:56:31,043 --> 00:56:33,242
- I just memorize the first letter.
- The north is Da. The east is Ji.

1558
00:56:33,813 --> 00:56:35,042
- Jeung, Gwang, Da, Ji.
- Dong Hyun.

1559
00:56:35,043 --> 00:56:36,582
Why don't we do this?

1560
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:38,613
The south is Jeung. The west is Gwang.

1561
00:56:39,052 --> 00:56:40,281
That's how I memorized those.

1562
00:56:40,282 --> 00:56:41,653
I can't go beyond four letters.

1563
00:56:42,023 --> 00:56:44,352
I'll memorize Jeung, Gwang, Da, Ji.

1564
00:56:44,353 --> 00:56:46,551
- I memorized these.
- Yes. Jeung, Gwang, Da, Ji.

1565
00:56:46,552 --> 00:56:48,261
- The north is Da.
- Jeung, Jang...

1566
00:56:48,262 --> 00:56:49,462
- The east is Ji.
- Jeung, Gwang...

1567
00:56:49,463 --> 00:56:51,432
- The south is Jeung.
- Jeung, Gwang, Da, Ji.

1568
00:56:51,762 --> 00:56:53,362
- Gwangmok-cheonwang.
- Ji.

1569
00:56:53,363 --> 00:56:54,503
- Jiguk-cheonwang.
- Jeungjang-cheonwang.

1570
00:56:54,963 --> 00:56:57,871
- Okay. I'll give you the quiz.
- The quiz.

1571
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,833
(Nervous)

1572
00:57:00,173 --> 00:57:02,472
- Please.
- At Tongdosa Temple,

1573
00:57:02,642 --> 00:57:05,273
each building has the eaves.

1574
00:57:05,642 --> 00:57:07,512
- What?
- When you see the eaves,

1575
00:57:07,682 --> 00:57:10,813
there are pots underneath them.

1576
00:57:11,383 --> 00:57:12,912
- The pots underneath the eaves.
- Okay.

1577
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:15,322
If you haven't seen them, you can go and see...

1578
00:57:15,452 --> 00:57:17,353
- the eaves near you.
- Have you seen the pots?

1579
00:57:17,653 --> 00:57:20,462
- Monk Su Jin!
- Okay, for now.

1580
00:57:20,463 --> 00:57:22,391
He didn't mention the pots.

1581
00:57:22,392 --> 00:57:25,592
If you can go and check the eaves right behind you...

1582
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:27,532
Where are the pots?

1583
00:57:28,103 --> 00:57:29,302
What's in them?

1584
00:57:29,903 --> 00:57:31,202
- Before...
- Something like that?

1585
00:57:31,702 --> 00:57:34,302
Wait. That one over there?

1586
00:57:35,043 --> 00:57:37,242
The brown one between the pillars.

1587
00:57:37,572 --> 00:57:39,673
- Which one?
- The brown one over here.

1588
00:57:40,342 --> 00:57:41,681
I was going to ask him about it, but I didn't.

1589
00:57:41,682 --> 00:57:44,411
Monk Su Jin didn't teach us about it.

1590
00:57:44,412 --> 00:57:45,451
He didn't say anything about it.

1591
00:57:45,452 --> 00:57:47,551
- I'm certain of it.
- You have to quiz us...

1592
00:57:47,552 --> 00:57:49,622
- on what he said.
- This is really...

1593
00:57:49,753 --> 00:57:52,321
- We really haven't heard of it.
- We just saw it for the first time.

1594
00:57:52,322 --> 00:57:53,761
We've never heard of the pot before.

1595
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:55,862
Rewind the audio and check.

1596
00:57:55,863 --> 00:57:57,692
- I...
- Monk Su Jin.

1597
00:57:57,693 --> 00:57:59,391
You didn't talk about the pot, did you?

1598
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:02,261
- I was going to ask him about it.
- This is crazy.

1599
00:58:02,262 --> 00:58:05,133
Monk Su Jin got too nervous,

1600
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:06,971
and he forgot about it.

1601
00:58:06,972 --> 00:58:08,201
There was nothing about the pots.

1602
00:58:08,202 --> 00:58:10,071
- Please listen to the whole quiz.
- Okay.

1603
00:58:10,072 --> 00:58:11,341
(Please calm down and listen to the quiz.)

1604
00:58:11,342 --> 00:58:13,071
- Here's the quiz.
- Okay.

1605
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:14,182
The quiz starts now?

1606
00:58:14,483 --> 00:58:16,712
The pot you just saw...

1607
00:58:16,713 --> 00:58:20,753
is placed under each eave...

1608
00:58:20,853 --> 00:58:23,922
to wish for a good year and prevent fire.

1609
00:58:23,923 --> 00:58:24,923
Okay.

1610
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:30,122
They put this in the pots...

1611
00:58:30,262 --> 00:58:32,092
as "The seawater prevents fire."

1612
00:58:32,633 --> 00:58:34,863
What is this?

1613
00:58:35,403 --> 00:58:36,833
They put the seawater in?

1614
00:58:37,673 --> 00:58:39,833
- But this is...
- It's not saltwater, is it?

1615
00:58:40,603 --> 00:58:42,503
They say it's seawater.

1616
00:58:42,642 --> 00:58:43,741
I'll read the quiz again.

1617
00:58:43,742 --> 00:58:45,572
- "The seawater prevents fire." - They put...

1618
00:58:45,872 --> 00:58:49,212
this in the pots...

1619
00:58:49,213 --> 00:58:51,681
- as "The seawater prevents fire." - That's what it means.

1620
00:58:51,682 --> 00:58:53,883
- Yes. What is this?
- You don't put out fire with it.

1621
00:58:54,483 --> 00:58:58,122
Tae Hyun, they have the same thing in Gyeongbokgung Palace.

1622
00:58:58,423 --> 00:59:01,192
They hold some water in front of it.

1623
00:59:01,193 --> 00:59:02,221
- Water?
- Like this much.

1624
00:59:02,222 --> 00:59:04,793
- That's the ancient extinguisher.
- I see.

1625
00:59:05,092 --> 00:59:06,732
It was easy to catch fire because it was a wooden building.

1626
00:59:06,733 --> 00:59:08,931
Did they put seawater in it?

1627
00:59:08,932 --> 00:59:10,133
No, just water.

1628
00:59:10,233 --> 00:59:13,133
It means "The seawater prevents fire."

1629
00:59:13,773 --> 00:59:15,742
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

1630
00:59:15,872 --> 00:59:17,673
Is this something we've learned?

1631
00:59:18,273 --> 00:59:19,273
- Exactly.
- I know.

1632
00:59:19,274 --> 00:59:20,582
- I kept memorizing...
- This is really important.

1633
00:59:20,583 --> 00:59:21,583
- It's because...
- You're right.

1634
00:59:21,584 --> 00:59:23,043
- Come on!
- Jiguk... What was it?

1635
00:59:23,412 --> 00:59:25,082
Jeungjang-cheonwang. I memorized all of them.

1636
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:28,153
Jeungjang-cheonwang is the deity of the south.

1637
00:59:28,483 --> 00:59:30,892
At the west is Gwangmok-cheonwang.

1638
00:59:31,592 --> 00:59:33,491
At the north is Damun-cheonwang.

1639
00:59:33,492 --> 00:59:34,962
At the east is Jiguk-cheonwang.

1640
00:59:34,963 --> 00:59:37,161
- Jiguk-cheonwang and such.
- But if you ask us about a pot...

1641
00:59:37,162 --> 00:59:38,292
(He actually memorized all the deities' names.)

1642
00:59:38,293 --> 00:59:39,562
- Seriously.
- We didn't learn about it.

1643
00:59:39,563 --> 00:59:41,502
What's in that pot?

1644
00:59:41,503 --> 00:59:44,273
(The quiz is different from their expectations.)

1645
00:59:44,633 --> 00:59:45,932
The thing is,

1646
00:59:46,072 --> 00:59:49,542
you can answer this question by listening carefully.

1647
00:59:49,543 --> 00:59:51,272
Hold on. In that case...

1648
00:59:51,273 --> 00:59:52,841
- They thought...
- Seawater.

1649
00:59:52,842 --> 00:59:55,181
The seawater prevented fire. So what did they put in the pot?

1650
00:59:55,182 --> 00:59:57,252
I guess it's water like you said.

1651
00:59:57,253 --> 00:59:58,753
- Water.
- Saltwater?

1652
00:59:59,782 --> 01:00:02,083
- Saltwater.
- It can't be seawater.

1653
01:00:02,282 --> 01:00:04,221
"The seawater prevents fire."

1654
01:00:04,222 --> 01:00:05,821
"The seawater prevents fire."

1655
01:00:05,822 --> 01:00:06,852
Is it seawater?

1656
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:11,132
- Did they put salt in it?
- Any type of water puts out fire.

1657
01:00:11,133 --> 01:00:13,462
- But what's inside the pot?
- Saltwater?

1658
01:00:13,463 --> 01:00:14,602
(Carefree)

1659
01:00:14,603 --> 01:00:15,603
- Saltwater?
- That's what we need to guess.

1660
01:00:15,604 --> 01:00:17,172
- Tae Hyun, you're incredible.
- Is it saltwater?

1661
01:00:17,173 --> 01:00:18,402
- It's salt.
- What?

1662
01:00:18,403 --> 01:00:20,132
- Salt.
- Is it salt or saltwater?

1663
01:00:20,133 --> 01:00:21,173
It's salt.

1664
01:00:21,543 --> 01:00:23,813
Water dries out.

1665
01:00:24,142 --> 01:00:26,613
- Water dries out.
- It's salt. Salt prevents fire.

1666
01:00:26,742 --> 01:00:29,312
- Really?
- "The seawater prevents fire."

1667
01:00:29,313 --> 01:00:32,813
- So they put salt in it.
- In the pot,

1668
01:00:33,653 --> 01:00:36,282
they put salt to prevent fire.

1669
01:00:37,923 --> 01:00:39,022
- Who are you talking to?
- Salt.

1670
01:00:39,023 --> 01:00:40,591
- Who are you talking to?
- Is it saltwater?

1671
01:00:40,592 --> 01:00:42,721
- Who are you talking to?
- It isn't like that.

1672
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,261
- Who are you talking to?
- Is it salt?

1673
01:00:44,262 --> 01:00:45,833
- What?
- Do you think it's salt?

1674
01:00:45,932 --> 01:00:47,932
- I think it's salt.
- It must be salt.

1675
01:00:48,162 --> 01:00:50,402
We can get it wrong since we have a reattempt card.

1676
01:00:50,403 --> 01:00:51,632
Okay. Let's go.

1677
01:00:51,633 --> 01:00:53,472
- Tae Hyun, I'm certain.
- Okay.

1678
01:00:53,603 --> 01:00:55,042
I'm the game changer.

1679
01:00:55,043 --> 01:00:56,241
- It's salt.
- Okay.

1680
01:00:56,242 --> 01:00:57,272
It has to be salt.

1681
01:00:57,273 --> 01:00:58,471
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1682
01:00:58,472 --> 01:00:59,942
- Salt.
- What's the answer?

1683
01:00:59,943 --> 01:01:01,212
One, two, three.

1684
01:01:01,213 --> 01:01:02,282
- Salt.
- Salt.

1685
01:01:02,983 --> 01:01:03,983
Salt.

1686
01:01:04,182 --> 01:01:05,583
Please.

1687
01:01:06,182 --> 01:01:07,353
It has to be right.

1688
01:01:14,662 --> 01:01:15,662
It has to be right.

1689
01:01:15,663 --> 01:01:17,431
It's correct.

1690
01:01:17,432 --> 01:01:18,462
(Correct)

1691
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:20,701
This is incredible.

1692
01:01:20,702 --> 01:01:22,701
(Happy)

1693
01:01:22,702 --> 01:01:24,133
- We did it.
- Hey.

1694
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:26,072
Tae Hyun.

1695
01:01:26,403 --> 01:01:28,443
Tae Hyun, we got Yangsan.

1696
01:01:28,543 --> 01:01:30,741
- Yangsan. The most important one.
- We didn't even use a hint.

1697
01:01:30,742 --> 01:01:31,813
We didn't use a hint.

1698
01:01:33,242 --> 01:01:34,842
(Yangsan: Tongdosa Temple's Geumgang Ordination Platform)

1699
01:01:35,282 --> 01:01:36,582
Things are going well.

1700
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:37,612
(Yangsan: Tongdosa Temple's Geumgang Ordination Platform)

1701
01:01:37,613 --> 01:01:39,182
- Nice.
- Nice.

1702
01:01:40,552 --> 01:01:41,982
Let me give a brief explanation.

1703
01:01:41,983 --> 01:01:44,492
Salt prevents decomposition.

1704
01:01:44,622 --> 01:01:47,391
People use salt symbolically...

1705
01:01:47,392 --> 01:01:49,492
to ward off evil energy.

1706
01:01:49,693 --> 01:01:52,232
On the Dano Day which is May fifth on the Lunar Calendar,

1707
01:01:52,233 --> 01:01:55,531
Tongdosa Temple holds a ritual for the Dragon King.

1708
01:01:55,532 --> 01:01:57,471
They empty the salt pots...

1709
01:01:57,472 --> 01:02:00,132
that were under the eaves of each building...

1710
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,371
and fill them with new salt.

1711
01:02:02,372 --> 01:02:04,472
(The pots get set up with new salt.)

1712
01:02:05,412 --> 01:02:09,443
(The energy of water gets added too.)

1713
01:02:10,512 --> 01:02:13,281
(The salt that protected Tongdosa Temple for a year...)

1714
01:02:13,282 --> 01:02:16,023
(is given to the followers on the Dano Day.)

1715
01:02:16,622 --> 01:02:19,192
- They change the salt.
- It's salt.

1716
01:02:19,193 --> 01:02:22,362
I had never seen those pots before.

1717
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:23,621
(They feel the joy of answering a question correctly.)

1718
01:02:23,622 --> 01:02:24,793
I have seen them before.

1719
01:02:25,463 --> 01:02:27,091
Do we get a meal?

1720
01:02:27,092 --> 01:02:28,902
Since you answered correctly,

1721
01:02:28,903 --> 01:02:31,403
- you'll get a meal.
- Okay.

1722
01:02:31,503 --> 01:02:33,503
- What is it?
- The Yangsan card.

1723
01:02:33,833 --> 01:02:35,042
This is incredible.

1724
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:38,043
- On the back is...
- My goodness.

1725
01:02:38,173 --> 01:02:40,241
- a dish you can eat here.
- My goodness.

1726
01:02:40,242 --> 01:02:41,312
This is incredible.

1727
01:02:41,313 --> 01:02:43,142
(What's the Yangsan menu that got good reactions?)

1728
01:02:43,842 --> 01:02:46,012
(Yangsan: Water parsley pork belly)

1729
01:02:46,282 --> 01:02:49,083
(At Yangsan, the city of the water parsley festival, )

1730
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:51,391
(they'll enjoy the combination...)

1731
01:02:51,392 --> 01:02:53,722
(of the fragrant water parsley and savory pork belly.)

1732
01:02:56,222 --> 01:02:58,491
(The dish is both aromatic and tasty.)

1733
01:02:58,492 --> 01:03:02,063
(Water parsley pork belly)

1734
01:03:02,603 --> 01:03:04,102
- We don't have to eat it?
- No.

1735
01:03:04,103 --> 01:03:05,273
(They can decide whether or not they want a meal.)

1736
01:03:05,633 --> 01:03:06,833
Tae Hyun, aren't we going to eat?

1737
01:03:07,202 --> 01:03:09,971
- Shouldn't we hurry up?
- It looks so tasty.

1738
01:03:09,972 --> 01:03:11,341
- This is a problem.
- Tae Hyun.

1739
01:03:11,342 --> 01:03:14,282
- Tae Hyun, it looks so tasty.
- Hunger isn't an important issue.

1740
01:03:14,412 --> 01:03:15,613
- Tae Hyun.
- Think about...

1741
01:03:15,742 --> 01:03:16,982
- the race.
- I mean...

1742
01:03:16,983 --> 01:03:18,512
Tae Hyun, did you have breakfast?

1743
01:03:18,583 --> 01:03:19,882
- No, I didn't.
- Then let's have a meal.

1744
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:22,822
- Suppress your hunger, you punk.
- Tae Hyun, they must be eating too.

1745
01:03:23,083 --> 01:03:24,292
That was why they didn't put us to sleep.

1746
01:03:24,293 --> 01:03:26,451
Hey, none of them would be tempted to have a meal.

1747
01:03:26,452 --> 01:03:28,591
Tae Hyun, pork belly can be eaten in Seoul.

1748
01:03:28,592 --> 01:03:30,161
But water parsley pork belly can only be eaten here.

1749
01:03:30,162 --> 01:03:31,632
It's true.

1750
01:03:31,633 --> 01:03:33,692
- It looks so tasty.
- They're the same.

1751
01:03:33,693 --> 01:03:35,602
- For goodness' sake.
- We need food for energy.

1752
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,201
- We can't think otherwise.
- Unbelievable.

1753
01:03:37,202 --> 01:03:39,672
Tae Hyun, the brain uses the most amount of energy.

1754
01:03:39,673 --> 01:03:40,673
It uses 22 percent.

1755
01:03:40,972 --> 01:03:42,801
The brain uses 22 percent of the basal metabolism.

1756
01:03:42,802 --> 01:03:44,772
Twenty-two percent is a lot.

1757
01:03:44,773 --> 01:03:47,172
- Right? 22 percent.
- Let's talk on our way.

1758
01:03:47,173 --> 01:03:48,282
(Let's talk on our way.)

1759
01:03:48,782 --> 01:03:50,212
- The drawing looks so appetizing.
- I know.

1760
01:03:50,213 --> 01:03:51,551
Water parsley pork belly.

1761
01:03:51,552 --> 01:03:52,852
(Will Team Guys choose water parsley pork belly?)

1762
01:03:52,853 --> 01:03:55,281
(Meanwhile, Team Handsome)

1763
01:03:55,282 --> 01:03:56,922
(Cuckoo)

1764
01:03:56,923 --> 01:03:58,423
- Yangsan?
- Yangsan.

1765
01:03:58,753 --> 01:04:00,991
- It's as we expected.
- Yes.

1766
01:04:00,992 --> 01:04:03,321
As you can see, we got this square.

1767
01:04:03,322 --> 01:04:04,692
- Namhae is so far away.
- I know.

1768
01:04:04,693 --> 01:04:06,193
Let's try these two locations.

1769
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:09,363
If we use a reattempt card, we'll be able to get one right.

1770
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:11,332
Once we get one of the squares,

1771
01:04:11,333 --> 01:04:13,772
we'll be able to decide which direction to take.

1772
01:04:13,773 --> 01:04:15,971
All right. If we answer at once, we won't need a reattempt card.

1773
01:04:15,972 --> 01:04:17,572
That's right. Then we won't need to use it.

1774
01:04:17,813 --> 01:04:19,911
Then we won't need to be wary.

1775
01:04:19,912 --> 01:04:21,542
(They finish the briefing in a relaxed way.)

1776
01:04:21,543 --> 01:04:22,813
We're doing well...

1777
01:04:23,412 --> 01:04:27,113
thanks to Captain Jin's command.

1778
01:04:27,313 --> 01:04:29,522
- It's different.
- It sure is different.

1779
01:04:29,523 --> 01:04:30,523
It's easy.

1780
01:04:30,524 --> 01:04:31,692
(They have 30 minutes until they reach Upo Wetland.)

1781
01:04:31,693 --> 01:04:33,652
(Team Guys)

1782
01:04:33,653 --> 01:04:36,891
- Now, we got this square.
- Yes.

1783
01:04:36,892 --> 01:04:38,293
(They don't know that Team Handsome is headed to Upo Wetland.)

1784
01:04:38,532 --> 01:04:40,733
They're bound to go to Changnyeong.

1785
01:04:40,762 --> 01:04:42,532
They have to go to Changnyeong.

1786
01:04:43,103 --> 01:04:44,802
Shall we go to Changnyeong then?

1787
01:04:45,032 --> 01:04:46,133
Shall we?

1788
01:04:46,333 --> 01:04:49,003
Let's say they go...

1789
01:04:49,043 --> 01:04:50,503
to Yongseondae, Changnyeong.

1790
01:04:50,642 --> 01:04:52,713
If we get Jinju first,

1791
01:04:53,113 --> 01:04:54,411
they won't be able to complete the bingo.

1792
01:04:54,412 --> 01:04:56,512
They won't reach Jinju from Changnyeong...

1793
01:04:57,383 --> 01:04:58,583
while we eat, right?

1794
01:04:59,083 --> 01:05:00,252
I wonder where in Changnyeong they're at right now.

1795
01:05:00,253 --> 01:05:01,852
If you really want to eat,

1796
01:05:01,853 --> 01:05:03,552
we can hold out and have a meal in Jinju.

1797
01:05:04,023 --> 01:05:05,922
Once we go there, you'll tell us to hold out again.

1798
01:05:05,923 --> 01:05:07,591
- No.
- You'll do that.

1799
01:05:07,592 --> 01:05:10,422
- I won't do that.
- That way,

1800
01:05:10,423 --> 01:05:11,931
- we'll need to wait forever.
- No.

1801
01:05:11,932 --> 01:05:14,161
No. Let's eat in Jinju.

1802
01:05:14,162 --> 01:05:16,261
We have time to eat. Do you know why?

1803
01:05:16,262 --> 01:05:17,602
- This one involves hiking.
- It'll take a while.

1804
01:05:17,603 --> 01:05:19,173
It involves 40 minutes of hiking.

1805
01:05:19,403 --> 01:05:21,543
Wouldn't it be better to eat and travel comfortably?

1806
01:05:22,273 --> 01:05:24,471
- Eat in Jinju.
- Jinju?

1807
01:05:24,472 --> 01:05:25,511
Once we reach Jinju,

1808
01:05:25,512 --> 01:05:27,312
you'll go, "We don't have time. Let's eat at the next location."

1809
01:05:27,313 --> 01:05:28,542
Won't you do that?

1810
01:05:28,543 --> 01:05:29,641
But we need to think about this.

1811
01:05:29,642 --> 01:05:31,583
If they put us to sleep while we're eating,

1812
01:05:31,613 --> 01:05:33,383
- it'll be game over.
- I see.

1813
01:05:33,483 --> 01:05:35,782
Do you prefer going to Jinju then?

1814
01:05:36,083 --> 01:05:38,451
- You wanted to eat earlier.
- I'm torn.

1815
01:05:38,452 --> 01:05:41,062
You wanted to eat earlier.

1816
01:05:41,063 --> 01:05:43,792
- Hey, time is passing.
- We need to hurry up and decide.

1817
01:05:43,793 --> 01:05:44,793
(They've been having a meeting for 10 minutes.)

1818
01:05:44,794 --> 01:05:45,862
I hope they put us to sleep now.

1819
01:05:45,863 --> 01:05:47,091
Then we can lie down and think.

1820
01:05:47,092 --> 01:05:48,431
(Laughing)

1821
01:05:48,432 --> 01:05:49,503
It'll be perfect.

1822
01:05:50,503 --> 01:05:52,871
(Sighing)

1823
01:05:52,872 --> 01:05:56,172
- Hey, in that case...
- I'm so indecisive.

1824
01:05:56,173 --> 01:05:57,471
Tae Hyun, in that case...

1825
01:05:57,472 --> 01:05:58,641
- Hold on.
- Okay.

1826
01:05:58,642 --> 01:06:00,443
- I made up my mind.
- Here comes Solomon.

1827
01:06:01,012 --> 01:06:03,842
I want to give up on the meal and go to Jinju.

1828
01:06:04,213 --> 01:06:05,681
- Shall we go to Jinju?
- Okay.

1829
01:06:05,682 --> 01:06:07,352
I made that decision...

1830
01:06:07,353 --> 01:06:08,853
because I thought about the possible outcome.

1831
01:06:09,182 --> 01:06:12,321
The image of us catching monkfish flitted through my mind.

1832
01:06:12,322 --> 01:06:13,523
- We need to avoid that fate.
- Okay.

1833
01:06:13,753 --> 01:06:14,862
We should go to Jinju.

1834
01:06:14,863 --> 01:06:17,023
The GPS tells me that it takes an hour and a half to get there.

1835
01:06:17,392 --> 01:06:19,531
- Okay. Let's go, Tae Hyun.
- Okay.

1836
01:06:19,532 --> 01:06:21,701
- Aren't you hungry?
- Are you okay with driving?

1837
01:06:21,702 --> 01:06:23,432
- Shall we switch seats?
- Okay, I'll drive.

1838
01:06:24,133 --> 01:06:25,201
My goodness.

1839
01:06:25,202 --> 01:06:26,972
(The driver gets switched.)

1840
01:06:27,972 --> 01:06:31,172
They'll definitely know that we're going...

1841
01:06:31,173 --> 01:06:32,242
to Changnyeong.

1842
01:06:32,673 --> 01:06:34,882
- It'll take an hour and a half.
- An hour and a half?

1843
01:06:34,883 --> 01:06:35,912
- Yes.
- Okay.

1844
01:06:36,443 --> 01:06:40,512
(Team Guys heads to Jinju.)

1845
01:06:41,752 --> 01:06:43,452
We're entering the market.

1846
01:06:43,453 --> 01:06:44,891
I bet they sell water parsley pork belly here.

1847
01:06:44,892 --> 01:06:46,493
(Laughing)

1848
01:06:46,623 --> 01:06:48,892
(Dong Hyun is ridiculous.)

1849
01:06:49,323 --> 01:06:51,063
There's a pork belly restaurant.

1850
01:06:51,533 --> 01:06:53,292
Water parsley pork belly sounds so delicious.

1851
01:06:53,993 --> 01:06:57,362
(He's still hung up on the water parsley pork belly.)

1852
01:06:57,363 --> 01:06:58,532
- Water parsley.
- Gosh.

1853
01:06:58,533 --> 01:07:00,903
I see that Dong Hyun is a handful.

1854
01:07:01,443 --> 01:07:03,243
It's so tasty when it's grilled.

1855
01:07:04,172 --> 01:07:06,541
I see that you love to eat.

1856
01:07:06,542 --> 01:07:08,082
Of course, I love it.

1857
01:07:08,642 --> 01:07:11,453
Tae Hyun, we'll eat if we answer correctly in Jinju.

1858
01:07:11,653 --> 01:07:13,081
Okay. I promise that.

1859
01:07:13,082 --> 01:07:14,381
We have to eat then.

1860
01:07:14,382 --> 01:07:15,522
I promise that.

1861
01:07:15,523 --> 01:07:16,523
(They'll revolt if he doesn't make a promise.)

1862
01:07:16,524 --> 01:07:17,752
Where is the board? Let me see it.

1863
01:07:18,193 --> 01:07:19,193
Tae Hyun.

1864
01:07:19,653 --> 01:07:21,592
Let me make a cautious guess.

1865
01:07:21,623 --> 01:07:23,262
Let's say we get Jinju...

1866
01:07:23,323 --> 01:07:25,391
and they get Upo Wetland, Changnyeong.

1867
01:07:25,392 --> 01:07:28,203
Don't say that we need to go to Namhae right away, okay?

1868
01:07:28,563 --> 01:07:29,733
We have to eat, okay?

1869
01:07:30,462 --> 01:07:31,672
- Okay.
- Okay.

1870
01:07:32,502 --> 01:07:33,772
Jinju.

1871
01:07:33,773 --> 01:07:35,142
(Team Guys' mission: Eat in Jinju no matter what.)

1872
01:07:36,342 --> 01:07:37,373
(A bit later)

1873
01:07:37,943 --> 01:07:40,882
(Focused facial expression and busy hands)

1874
01:07:41,042 --> 01:07:43,913
(He's looking up something on YouTube.)

1875
01:07:47,413 --> 01:07:48,722
- Tae Hyun.
- Yes?

1876
01:07:49,082 --> 01:07:50,323
Just in case,

1877
01:07:51,493 --> 01:07:54,392
I looked up how monkfish was caught.

1878
01:07:54,693 --> 01:07:56,363
- Can you guess the first video?
- What is it?

1879
01:07:56,592 --> 01:07:57,631
"Extreme Job."

1880
01:07:57,632 --> 01:07:59,662
("Extreme Job")

1881
01:07:59,663 --> 01:08:01,663
Catching monkfish is considered an extreme job.

1882
01:08:01,703 --> 01:08:04,162
- My goodness.
- You set off early in the morning.

1883
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,273
(The monkfish boat sets off early in the morning.)

1884
01:08:05,302 --> 01:08:07,403
It isn't fishing we have in mind.

1885
01:08:07,873 --> 01:08:10,743
You need to throw and pull up the net.

1886
01:08:10,773 --> 01:08:12,873
- It's like commercial fishing.
- Totally.

1887
01:08:13,472 --> 01:08:15,342
Tae Hyun, they can bite and cut off your hands.

1888
01:08:18,212 --> 01:08:20,853
I heard that they could cut your fingers.

1889
01:08:21,382 --> 01:08:24,123
We have to focus on winning.

1890
01:08:24,323 --> 01:08:25,792
- Unbelievable.
- We have to do that.

1891
01:08:26,623 --> 01:08:28,162
(Team Handsome)

1892
01:08:28,163 --> 01:08:29,391
That's the road to Changnyeong.

1893
01:08:29,392 --> 01:08:30,392
(Changnyeong)

1894
01:08:30,393 --> 01:08:31,832
It's my first time visiting Changnyeong.

1895
01:08:33,493 --> 01:08:35,632
Don't you think that we can buy anti-drowsiness gum?

1896
01:08:36,002 --> 01:08:37,331
I think it'll be okay.

1897
01:08:37,332 --> 01:08:39,331
It's not like we'll swallow it to fill our stomachs.

1898
01:08:39,332 --> 01:08:40,332
That's right.

1899
01:08:41,142 --> 01:08:42,402
All right.

1900
01:08:42,403 --> 01:08:43,403
(Sang Uk remains silent.)

1901
01:08:43,404 --> 01:08:45,512
They can hear us, but we act like we're talking to ourselves.

1902
01:08:45,573 --> 01:08:47,943
(Restless)

1903
01:08:48,483 --> 01:08:50,312
It'll be for the adults.

1904
01:08:50,313 --> 01:08:52,353
(He seems to be looking for something desperately.)

1905
01:08:52,413 --> 01:08:54,422
I'm hungry. Aren't you hungry?

1906
01:08:55,023 --> 01:08:56,123
Of course, I'm hungry.

1907
01:08:56,422 --> 01:08:58,392
I really want to use the restroom.

1908
01:08:58,653 --> 01:09:00,291
(The red alert for the restroom gets issued in the car!)

1909
01:09:00,292 --> 01:09:02,962
Hey, you should've told me sooner.

1910
01:09:02,993 --> 01:09:04,592
We should make a stop if we see a restroom.

1911
01:09:05,033 --> 01:09:06,892
There isn't a gas station nearby, is there?

1912
01:09:07,563 --> 01:09:10,663
There must be something like a restaurant.

1913
01:09:10,972 --> 01:09:13,403
(Is it the effect of iced tea?)

1914
01:09:13,472 --> 01:09:14,742
Hang in there. We'll find something.

1915
01:09:14,743 --> 01:09:15,841
(Consoling)

1916
01:09:15,842 --> 01:09:18,443
I can't believe there's a crane truck in front of us.

1917
01:09:18,913 --> 01:09:21,181
It'll be nice if it can let us pass.

1918
01:09:21,182 --> 01:09:22,512
(The crane truck drives slowly.)

1919
01:09:22,743 --> 01:09:25,211
I enjoy overcoming such hardships.

1920
01:09:25,212 --> 01:09:26,381
- Is that so?
- I'm an athlete.

1921
01:09:26,382 --> 01:09:27,452
It's no wonder you got the gold medal.

1922
01:09:27,453 --> 01:09:28,453
It makes sense.

1923
01:09:28,454 --> 01:09:29,652
It's no wonder you got the gold medal.

1924
01:09:29,653 --> 01:09:31,823
I know. The gold medalist sure is different.

1925
01:09:32,123 --> 01:09:33,623
Overcoming hardships.

1926
01:09:34,462 --> 01:09:35,792
If there were no hardships,

1927
01:09:36,663 --> 01:09:38,492
I wouldn't have been so appreciative.

1928
01:09:38,493 --> 01:09:39,832
Do you want to pee in nature?

1929
01:09:39,993 --> 01:09:41,302
I can't do it in nature.

1930
01:09:41,632 --> 01:09:43,662
I can't do it in nature since I have a stomachache.

1931
01:09:43,663 --> 01:09:45,032
(I have a stomachache.)

1932
01:09:45,033 --> 01:09:46,502
- Is it number two?
- Yes.

1933
01:09:46,573 --> 01:09:48,541
- You should've said so.
- Is it number two?

1934
01:09:48,542 --> 01:09:50,902
- There's a village. Hold on.
- If it's number two...

1935
01:09:50,903 --> 01:09:52,641
- That changes things.
- Seriously.

1936
01:09:52,642 --> 01:09:53,712
My goodness.

1937
01:09:54,443 --> 01:09:56,443
- Why didn't you say so?
- Seriously.

1938
01:09:56,913 --> 01:09:59,412
Look at this. I'm driving hurriedly now.

1939
01:09:59,413 --> 01:10:01,181
- It's okay.
- I thought it was number one.

1940
01:10:01,182 --> 01:10:02,823
I enjoy hardships.

1941
01:10:03,323 --> 01:10:05,023
There's a community center.

1942
01:10:06,052 --> 01:10:07,152
Nice.

1943
01:10:07,153 --> 01:10:08,693
- Here.
- A community center.

1944
01:10:09,092 --> 01:10:10,421
The door is open.

1945
01:10:10,422 --> 01:10:11,562
(The door is open.)

1946
01:10:11,563 --> 01:10:13,631
- Okay.
- Try knocking.

1947
01:10:13,632 --> 01:10:15,131
- There.
- There.

1948
01:10:15,132 --> 01:10:16,703
- There.
- It's a restroom.

1949
01:10:17,262 --> 01:10:19,131
Hurry up and go to the restroom.

1950
01:10:19,132 --> 01:10:20,373
How nice.

1951
01:10:20,703 --> 01:10:22,703
- Check if there's toilet paper.
- Okay.

1952
01:10:23,873 --> 01:10:25,671
(Thanks to the older members, he enters the restroom relaxedly!)

1953
01:10:25,672 --> 01:10:27,242
We need to find toilet paper if there isn't any.

1954
01:10:27,243 --> 01:10:29,182
I think it's too small for you.

1955
01:10:29,443 --> 01:10:31,711
- There's toilet paper.
- It's so cramped.

1956
01:10:31,712 --> 01:10:33,153
It's a nice restroom.

1957
01:10:33,353 --> 01:10:35,523
- Because you're tall...
- It's too small.

1958
01:10:37,353 --> 01:10:38,751
Sang Uk, take your time.

1959
01:10:38,752 --> 01:10:44,163
(We're adjusting the screen to protect the medalist's dignity.)

1960
01:10:45,292 --> 01:10:47,163
(Team Guys)

1961
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,603
(My goodness)

1962
01:10:49,932 --> 01:10:53,273
(The worrywart has another worry.)

1963
01:10:53,472 --> 01:10:55,403
I think they're going to Jinju.

1964
01:10:57,103 --> 01:10:59,442
- You think they're going to Jinju.
- Tae Hyun,

1965
01:10:59,443 --> 01:11:02,381
I'm someone who wrote a book on psychology.

1966
01:11:02,382 --> 01:11:04,112
Stop it already.

1967
01:11:04,113 --> 01:11:05,952
(Dong Hyun, stop talking big.)

1968
01:11:05,953 --> 01:11:08,582
I wrote "Kim Dong Hyun's Lesson on Mentality."

1969
01:11:08,682 --> 01:11:10,452
Tae Hyun, trust my hunch.

1970
01:11:10,453 --> 01:11:11,522
They're going to Jinju.

1971
01:11:11,523 --> 01:11:12,552
I think...

1972
01:11:13,052 --> 01:11:14,892
they'll go to Changnyeong.

1973
01:11:14,962 --> 01:11:16,692
In that case,

1974
01:11:16,693 --> 01:11:18,533
why don't we check their location?

1975
01:11:18,792 --> 01:11:19,892
Tae Hyun.

1976
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,931
We already took Yangsan.

1977
01:11:21,932 --> 01:11:23,462
We just need to know...

1978
01:11:23,603 --> 01:11:25,872
whether they're going to Jinju or Changnyeong...

1979
01:11:25,873 --> 01:11:27,431
to block them.

1980
01:11:27,432 --> 01:11:28,501
- It'll be easy for us.
- Yes.

1981
01:11:28,502 --> 01:11:30,501
Then we'll know...

1982
01:11:30,502 --> 01:11:32,672
- if there'll be a switch.
- That's right.

1983
01:11:33,042 --> 01:11:35,212
Our current location is...

1984
01:11:36,212 --> 01:11:38,452
We're right before the crossroads...

1985
01:11:38,453 --> 01:11:40,852
- of Changnyeong and Jinju.
- Okay.

1986
01:11:40,853 --> 01:11:42,823
- We should check now.
- It's the perfect timing.

1987
01:11:42,953 --> 01:11:44,751
- It's the perfect timing.
- We'll use the card...

1988
01:11:44,752 --> 01:11:46,922
to check the other team's current location.

1989
01:11:47,453 --> 01:11:49,623
We'll message you the location.

1990
01:11:50,863 --> 01:11:52,091
I'm curious.

1991
01:11:52,092 --> 01:11:53,391
(Curious)

1992
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:54,502
Please.

1993
01:11:55,163 --> 01:11:56,301
(This is the location of Team Handsome.)

1994
01:11:56,302 --> 01:11:57,533
They're in Changnyeong.

1995
01:11:57,733 --> 01:11:59,902
- Upo Wetland.
- They're going to Upo Wetland.

1996
01:11:59,903 --> 01:12:01,341
Yes. We can see Upo in the map.

1997
01:12:01,342 --> 01:12:02,943
- Are they going to Upo?
- Yes.

1998
01:12:03,472 --> 01:12:04,572
Hold on.

1999
01:12:04,573 --> 01:12:05,712
(Jinju is incorrect!)

2000
01:12:05,972 --> 01:12:08,113
Are they willing to go to Namhae?

2001
01:12:08,443 --> 01:12:10,712
It's okay. We're going to Jinju.

2002
01:12:10,913 --> 01:12:12,813
We can go to Namhae afterward.

2003
01:12:15,453 --> 01:12:17,122
Because of that,

2004
01:12:17,123 --> 01:12:19,592
you're going to postpone eating.

2005
01:12:19,752 --> 01:12:21,091
We should eat something.

2006
01:12:21,092 --> 01:12:24,462
- Seriously.
- We need to reach Jinju quickly.

2007
01:12:24,892 --> 01:12:26,831
I have a feeling that he'll tell us not to eat...

2008
01:12:26,832 --> 01:12:29,103
since they can put us to sleep.

2009
01:12:29,863 --> 01:12:31,972
(Team Handsome)

2010
01:12:32,073 --> 01:12:33,402
We're nearly there.

2011
01:12:33,403 --> 01:12:35,603
- It's in 700m.
- It's in 700m.

2012
01:12:37,042 --> 01:12:38,542
Just what will we do here?

2013
01:12:38,913 --> 01:12:40,412
(The road suddenly becomes unpaved.)

2014
01:12:40,413 --> 01:12:41,512
What's this?

2015
01:12:41,743 --> 01:12:43,612
Why is this road...

2016
01:12:43,613 --> 01:12:44,653
(Team Handsome drives along the bumpy road in the forest.)

2017
01:12:45,182 --> 01:12:46,652
What's this place?

2018
01:12:46,653 --> 01:12:47,681
(What kind of a place is Upo Wetland?)

2019
01:12:47,682 --> 01:12:49,022
(He spots something.)

2020
01:12:49,023 --> 01:12:50,353
Sanbakbeol?

2021
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:53,192
It must be a popular travel destination...

2022
01:12:53,193 --> 01:12:54,693
since there's a sign.

2023
01:12:55,063 --> 01:12:57,193
Shouldn't we go left? Go left.

2024
01:12:57,462 --> 01:12:58,662
Go left.

2025
01:12:58,663 --> 01:12:59,692
(Which way should I go?)

2026
01:12:59,693 --> 01:13:01,632
The curator will get in the car...

2027
01:13:01,663 --> 01:13:04,532
and you'll listen to the explanation in the form of a safari tour.

2028
01:13:04,533 --> 01:13:05,533
In the car?

2029
01:13:05,534 --> 01:13:06,832
Will the curator get in the car?

2030
01:13:07,672 --> 01:13:09,443
- I'll welcome the curator.
- Okay.

2031
01:13:12,073 --> 01:13:14,211
- Hello.
- Hello.

2032
01:13:14,212 --> 01:13:16,182
- Please come this way.
- Okay.

2033
01:13:16,913 --> 01:13:18,751
- You must've waited long.
- Not really.

2034
01:13:18,752 --> 01:13:19,983
I had to use the restroom.

2035
01:13:20,252 --> 01:13:23,081
Ma'am, please fasten your seatbelt.

2036
01:13:23,082 --> 01:13:25,192
- Okay. Please go left.
- Shall we go left?

2037
01:13:25,193 --> 01:13:27,352
(It's the wetland that has the wonders of the ancient times.)

2038
01:13:27,353 --> 01:13:30,862
I'm in charge of Changnyeong's national heritage.

2039
01:13:30,863 --> 01:13:32,493
I'm Curator Kim Mi Jung.

2040
01:13:32,962 --> 01:13:34,602
It's nice to meet you. There must be...

2041
01:13:34,603 --> 01:13:37,001
a department that's dedicated to the national heritage.

2042
01:13:37,002 --> 01:13:40,632
The official name for Upo Wetland is...

2043
01:13:40,703 --> 01:13:43,742
the Changnyeong's Upo Wetland Natural Reserve.

2044
01:13:43,743 --> 01:13:45,372
- This is the place, right?
- Yes.

2045
01:13:45,373 --> 01:13:46,873
(Changnyeong's Upo Wetland Natural Reserve)

2046
01:13:48,212 --> 01:13:50,511
(Upo, Mokpo, Sajipo, Sanbakbeol, and Jjokibeol)

2047
01:13:50,512 --> 01:13:52,652
(The area is made of 3 wetlands that end with "Po...")

2048
01:13:52,653 --> 01:13:54,823
(and 2 wetlands that end with "Beol.")

2049
01:13:56,382 --> 01:13:58,192
There are many marshes here.

2050
01:13:58,193 --> 01:14:00,153
How big is the area?

2051
01:14:00,222 --> 01:14:04,163
It's about 2,600,000m² in size.

2052
01:14:04,422 --> 01:14:08,162
It's estimated to be made...

2053
01:14:08,163 --> 01:14:11,273
when the Korean peninsula came to be 140 million years ago.

2054
01:14:11,573 --> 01:14:14,001
Since it has been around for a long time,

2055
01:14:14,002 --> 01:14:15,841
people often say...

2056
01:14:15,842 --> 01:14:17,971
that Upo Wetland has...

2057
01:14:17,972 --> 01:14:20,113
the wonders of the ancient times.

2058
01:14:21,443 --> 01:14:23,141
(Exclaiming)

2059
01:14:23,142 --> 01:14:24,482
The reeds look insanely beautiful.

2060
01:14:24,483 --> 01:14:26,551
- Seriously.
- It's a field of reeds.

2061
01:14:26,552 --> 01:14:27,552
(Opening the window)

2062
01:14:27,752 --> 01:14:28,921
It's nice.

2063
01:14:28,922 --> 01:14:31,051
(After a brief explanation, the scenery looks different.)

2064
01:14:31,052 --> 01:14:32,822
This place is open.

2065
01:14:32,823 --> 01:14:34,791
A trip to this place will be therapeutic.

2066
01:14:34,792 --> 01:14:36,022
People can come here and walk.

2067
01:14:36,023 --> 01:14:37,462
Look at the tree. It's so big.

2068
01:14:37,563 --> 01:14:40,663
It must be a protected tree. It looks old.

2069
01:14:42,533 --> 01:14:47,472
(It's the handsome heritage site they encountered today.)

2070
01:14:49,103 --> 01:14:52,312
In 1998, it was listed as a protected wetland...

2071
01:14:52,313 --> 01:14:55,113
by the Ramsar Convention.

2072
01:14:55,182 --> 01:14:57,612
There's better news. In 2024,

2073
01:14:57,613 --> 01:15:02,453
UNESCO listed Changnyeong-gun as a biosphere reserve.

2074
01:15:02,552 --> 01:15:04,622
Was it listed this year?

2075
01:15:04,623 --> 01:15:07,852
Yes. It means that the value of the location...

2076
01:15:07,853 --> 01:15:11,092
is well-known worldwide.

2077
01:15:11,392 --> 01:15:15,202
Many aquatic plants live in Upo Wetland.

2078
01:15:15,203 --> 01:15:18,471
About 60 percent of the aquatic plants in Korea...

2079
01:15:18,472 --> 01:15:20,131
live in Upo Wetland.

2080
01:15:20,132 --> 01:15:21,233
Sixty percent?

2081
01:15:21,273 --> 01:15:24,171
A freshwater turtle species of Korea, Reeves' turtle...

2082
01:15:24,172 --> 01:15:26,542
- also lives in Upo Wetland.
- Reeves' turtle.

2083
01:15:27,512 --> 01:15:30,112
About 180 migratory birds...

2084
01:15:30,113 --> 01:15:33,853
visit every winter. It's a habitat for migratory birds.

2085
01:15:33,913 --> 01:15:36,582
It's called the haven for migratory birds.

2086
01:15:36,853 --> 01:15:39,522
You can find birds that are Korea's national monuments...

2087
01:15:39,523 --> 01:15:43,023
such as tundra swans and bean geese.

2088
01:15:45,392 --> 01:15:46,832
Look at that man.

2089
01:15:46,892 --> 01:15:49,261
He's birdwatching with binoculars.

2090
01:15:49,262 --> 01:15:51,373
You're right. He's birdwatching.

2091
01:15:51,603 --> 01:15:55,703
- There are many dabbling ducks.
- Dabbling ducks.

2092
01:15:55,903 --> 01:15:59,711
So you'll see many visitors.

2093
01:15:59,712 --> 01:16:01,041
(They arrive at the destination, Mokpo Embankment.)

2094
01:16:01,042 --> 01:16:03,642
- Let's get off here.
- We're stopping here, right?

2095
01:16:06,012 --> 01:16:07,552
This place is so big.

2096
01:16:08,323 --> 01:16:09,751
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

2097
01:16:09,752 --> 01:16:11,252
(Let's walk on the Mokpo Embankment and explore Upo Wetland.)

2098
01:16:12,153 --> 01:16:13,552
Does it cost money?

2099
01:16:13,922 --> 01:16:16,722
- No, you can use it.
- I see that it's free.

2100
01:16:17,563 --> 01:16:19,592
I'm curious. There are birds.

2101
01:16:21,462 --> 01:16:23,962
- They usually cost 50 cents.
- I know.

2102
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:25,832
I can see well.

2103
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:28,301
Can you see...

2104
01:16:28,302 --> 01:16:30,273
- Take a look.
- Can you see the ducks?

2105
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,772
We're looking at the birds, right?

2106
01:16:32,773 --> 01:16:34,272
(Jin becomes curious and looks through the telescope.)

2107
01:16:34,273 --> 01:16:36,212
- Can you see the birds?
- Yes.

2108
01:16:36,913 --> 01:16:38,413
- Gosh.
- They look pretty big.

2109
01:16:38,913 --> 01:16:40,412
(The giant youngest member goes last.)

2110
01:16:40,413 --> 01:16:41,752
- The image is so clear.
- Yes.

2111
01:16:41,783 --> 01:16:43,852
- There are so many birds.
- You're right.

2112
01:16:43,853 --> 01:16:45,391
- They're gathered in one place.
- The image is big.

2113
01:16:45,392 --> 01:16:46,523
You're right.

2114
01:16:47,922 --> 01:16:48,992
I can see them.

2115
01:16:48,993 --> 01:16:51,392
(They look once more using binoculars.)

2116
01:16:51,663 --> 01:16:53,163
How are they fast?

2117
01:16:54,693 --> 01:16:56,631
(Both the bird that hop...)

2118
01:16:56,632 --> 01:16:59,873
(and the bird that walks elegantly live here.)

2119
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:02,301
- What?
- What's that?

2120
01:17:02,302 --> 01:17:03,602
What? What is it?

2121
01:17:03,603 --> 01:17:04,971
(There are birds everywhere they see.)

2122
01:17:04,972 --> 01:17:06,073
Is it a fight?

2123
01:17:06,142 --> 01:17:08,413
They're coming in a line.

2124
01:17:10,243 --> 01:17:12,112
They're making ripples.

2125
01:17:12,113 --> 01:17:13,313
What are those birds?

2126
01:17:13,613 --> 01:17:14,653
They look like ducks.

2127
01:17:14,853 --> 01:17:17,982
In Upo Wetland, you can see migratory birds.

2128
01:17:17,983 --> 01:17:20,251
Have you heard of a crested ibis?

2129
01:17:20,252 --> 01:17:21,322
Of course.

2130
01:17:21,323 --> 01:17:23,192
Wasn't there a song about it? Ibis, ibis

2131
01:17:23,193 --> 01:17:24,791
- You know the song.
- Yes.

2132
01:17:24,792 --> 01:17:28,501
The place where you can see the most number of crested ibises...

2133
01:17:28,502 --> 01:17:30,203
is Upo Wetland.

2134
01:17:30,802 --> 01:17:34,102
In 1979, crested ibises disappeared.

2135
01:17:34,103 --> 01:17:36,041
They went extinct in Korea.

2136
01:17:36,042 --> 01:17:39,272
In 2019, they were restored...

2137
01:17:39,273 --> 01:17:40,943
- and released in the wild.
- That's incredible.

2138
01:17:41,443 --> 01:17:43,341
- To this day, - How were they restored?

2139
01:17:43,342 --> 01:17:45,783
The birds are protected in the area.

2140
01:17:46,512 --> 01:17:48,452
Back in the day, new folders in the computer...

2141
01:17:48,453 --> 01:17:49,652
got names such as "Crested ibis."

2142
01:17:49,653 --> 01:17:51,181
- That's right.
- You remember, right?

2143
01:17:51,182 --> 01:17:52,352
- Yes.
- That's right.

2144
01:17:52,353 --> 01:17:53,421
They were named after birds.

2145
01:17:53,422 --> 01:17:54,752
- Yes.
- That's right.

2146
01:17:55,462 --> 01:17:56,891
Another name was "Grey heron."

2147
01:17:56,892 --> 01:17:58,262
That's right.

2148
01:17:58,363 --> 01:18:00,493
You can see all of those birds here.

2149
01:18:01,332 --> 01:18:04,872
We tell the visitors that Upo Wetland is...

2150
01:18:04,873 --> 01:18:07,631
the living museum of natural history.

2151
01:18:07,632 --> 01:18:09,971
So I hope many people will visit Upo Wetland...

2152
01:18:09,972 --> 01:18:12,443
and check out the ecosystem.

2153
01:18:12,542 --> 01:18:14,983
- Thank you for the nice tour.
- Thank you.

2154
01:18:16,413 --> 01:18:19,181
- Shall we have the quiz?
- Okay.

2155
01:18:19,182 --> 01:18:20,782
After seeing and learning something new,

2156
01:18:20,783 --> 01:18:22,853
- this is the main event.
- That's right.

2157
01:18:23,783 --> 01:18:27,922
There are various tales that are related to Upo Wetland.

2158
01:18:28,153 --> 01:18:31,092
- I'll tell you one of the tales.
- Okay.

2159
01:18:31,323 --> 01:18:32,533
Once upon a time,

2160
01:18:32,632 --> 01:18:35,363
at a valley called Aegol near the place...

2161
01:18:35,962 --> 01:18:38,233
lived a "blank" family.

2162
01:18:38,703 --> 01:18:41,372
One day, a big rainstorm hit...

2163
01:18:41,373 --> 01:18:43,103
and the baby of the family got washed away.

2164
01:18:43,273 --> 01:18:45,612
The father left to save the baby,

2165
01:18:45,613 --> 01:18:46,971
but never came back.

2166
01:18:46,972 --> 01:18:49,582
In a worried state, the mother set off to find them.

2167
01:18:49,913 --> 01:18:52,282
Then she came across a pine branch...

2168
01:18:52,283 --> 01:18:54,051
her husband rode next to a rock.

2169
01:18:54,052 --> 01:18:56,721
Until the cold winter came, she didn't leave the rock.

2170
01:18:56,722 --> 01:18:58,221
She waited tearfully.

2171
01:18:58,222 --> 01:18:59,652
In the end, her body froze...

2172
01:18:59,653 --> 01:19:02,523
and she became a black rock.

2173
01:19:02,693 --> 01:19:04,722
Afterward, the name of the rock became...

2174
01:19:04,962 --> 01:19:07,493
"Blank" Rock.

2175
01:19:08,092 --> 01:19:09,762
What goes in the blank?

2176
01:19:10,563 --> 01:19:11,703
Give us the choices.

2177
01:19:13,033 --> 01:19:14,103
There are...

2178
01:19:14,432 --> 01:19:16,202
- no choices.
- Come on.

2179
01:19:16,203 --> 01:19:18,243
- This is a hard one.
- My goodness.

2180
01:19:18,373 --> 01:19:19,972
- Gosh.
- It might be a bit hard.

2181
01:19:20,313 --> 01:19:22,743
We need to make deductions.

2182
01:19:22,882 --> 01:19:24,641
Most rock names have two syllables.

2183
01:19:24,642 --> 01:19:26,082
- "Blank" Rock.
- Ulsan Rock.

2184
01:19:26,382 --> 01:19:28,751
"She became a black rock."

2185
01:19:28,752 --> 01:19:29,881
"Black."

2186
01:19:29,882 --> 01:19:31,282
(Black)

2187
01:19:31,283 --> 01:19:32,993
- "Ice." - "Black Ice?"

2188
01:19:33,493 --> 01:19:34,552
"Black Ice?"

2189
01:19:34,922 --> 01:19:36,961
- "Black Ice Rock?" - "Black Ice Rock."

2190
01:19:36,962 --> 01:19:38,022
It sounds like the name of a bingsu.

2191
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:40,163
"Black Ice Rock." It doesn't sound promising.

2192
01:19:41,493 --> 01:19:42,532
(It was "blank" family.)

2193
01:19:42,533 --> 01:19:44,032
(Black Ice sounds totally off.)

2194
01:19:44,033 --> 01:19:45,431
It's the name of a black rock.

2195
01:19:45,432 --> 01:19:47,073
(They have no idea.)

2196
01:19:47,533 --> 01:19:50,402
"Blank" Family. "Blank" Rock.

2197
01:19:50,403 --> 01:19:51,671
Is the same word used for both of them?

2198
01:19:51,672 --> 01:19:52,672
Yes.

2199
01:19:52,673 --> 01:19:54,041
- We have to find that word.
- I see.

2200
01:19:54,042 --> 01:19:56,243
- It must be an animal.
- You think it's an animal?

2201
01:19:57,042 --> 01:19:58,852
It must be a family from stories from the past.

2202
01:19:58,853 --> 01:20:00,453
Is it the Migratory Bird Family?

2203
01:20:00,682 --> 01:20:02,453
The Frog Family. The Pig Family.

2204
01:20:02,783 --> 01:20:04,153
It won't be the Super Radical Gag Family.

2205
01:20:04,552 --> 01:20:05,992
(The sudden attack of the Super Radical Gag Family)

2206
01:20:05,993 --> 01:20:08,492
Why would it be the Super Radical Gag Family?

2207
01:20:08,493 --> 01:20:09,921
That was the only family I could think of.

2208
01:20:09,922 --> 01:20:11,163
"Blank" Family.

2209
01:20:11,592 --> 01:20:13,493
If that happens to be the actual answer...

2210
01:20:14,462 --> 01:20:17,802
It would be something like the Beaver Family or Turtle Family.

2211
01:20:18,033 --> 01:20:19,672
It would be a really simple word.

2212
01:20:20,073 --> 01:20:21,331
Bird Family Rock.

2213
01:20:21,332 --> 01:20:23,842
(Bird Family Rock)

2214
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:26,313
This place is known for the birds.

2215
01:20:26,512 --> 01:20:28,681
If the baby didn't leave...

2216
01:20:28,682 --> 01:20:30,681
and was swept down by the flood,

2217
01:20:30,682 --> 01:20:32,512
won't it be an animal that lives in the water?

2218
01:20:32,783 --> 01:20:34,413
The Turtle Rock? The Turtle Family?

2219
01:20:34,853 --> 01:20:36,222
- Turtle?
- It sounds plausible.

2220
01:20:36,752 --> 01:20:38,122
More than it being a bird,

2221
01:20:38,123 --> 01:20:41,863
I think there's a higher possibility of it being a turtle.

2222
01:20:42,023 --> 01:20:43,721
Birds fly.

2223
01:20:43,722 --> 01:20:46,163
There's no reason for a bird to be swept away with a branch.

2224
01:20:46,632 --> 01:20:48,193
Won't it be something simple?

2225
01:20:48,563 --> 01:20:50,332
You'll be surprised by how simple it is.

2226
01:20:50,462 --> 01:20:51,732
Right.

2227
01:20:51,733 --> 01:20:52,733
- The Super Radical Gag Family?
- But...

2228
01:20:52,734 --> 01:20:53,971
(The Super Radical Gag Family?)

2229
01:20:53,972 --> 01:20:56,103
It's not that one, my friend!

2230
01:20:56,573 --> 01:20:57,641
That sounds like a simple answer to me.

2231
01:20:57,642 --> 01:20:58,642
If we know the number of characters...

2232
01:20:58,743 --> 01:21:00,443
- Let's try to go for the answer.
- Okay.

2233
01:21:01,172 --> 01:21:02,641
- I have no clue.
- So what did we decide on?

2234
01:21:02,642 --> 01:21:03,682
I'm not sure.

2235
01:21:05,712 --> 01:21:07,413
Bird Family could be a good shout.

2236
01:21:09,722 --> 01:21:11,283
- Go with it.
- All right.

2237
01:21:12,792 --> 01:21:14,123
- We'll go for the answer!
- Right.

2238
01:21:14,493 --> 01:21:16,123
This rock is called...

2239
01:21:17,292 --> 01:21:19,063
I feel bad about calling it out as it doesn't seem right.

2240
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:20,931
Let's think about it one more time.

2241
01:21:20,932 --> 01:21:24,363
- Right.
- That's such a great idea!

2242
01:21:24,663 --> 01:21:25,802
That's such a great idea!

2243
01:21:26,802 --> 01:21:28,471
Let's think about it one more time.

2244
01:21:28,472 --> 01:21:30,472
(The rock that appears in a fable of Upo Wetland)

2245
01:21:31,203 --> 01:21:34,472
(What is the name of it?)

2246
01:21:35,712 --> 01:21:37,442
(Team Guys)

2247
01:21:37,443 --> 01:21:38,483
Tae Hyun.

2248
01:21:38,913 --> 01:21:42,123
Should I carefully make another prediction?

2249
01:21:42,453 --> 01:21:44,283
It has been a while since they arrived at Upo.

2250
01:21:44,752 --> 01:21:46,453
I don't think they got the answer.

2251
01:21:47,092 --> 01:21:48,461
That can't be true.

2252
01:21:48,462 --> 01:21:50,792
Upo was just five minutes away.

2253
01:21:51,762 --> 01:21:52,863
They got it wrong.

2254
01:21:53,762 --> 01:21:54,792
When are they going to come?

2255
01:21:54,962 --> 01:21:56,362
They won't beat us now.

2256
01:21:56,363 --> 01:21:57,461
Everything has been decided.

2257
01:21:57,462 --> 01:22:00,432
They can never beat us now with how things have panned out.

2258
01:22:01,233 --> 01:22:04,402
(They enter Jinju while being certain about their win.)

2259
01:22:04,403 --> 01:22:07,273
All right. We have around ten minutes left to Jinju.

2260
01:22:08,042 --> 01:22:10,042
Jinju feels like...

2261
01:22:10,743 --> 01:22:13,352
the city of victory for us.

2262
01:22:13,353 --> 01:22:15,322
- Why?
- I can feel it.

2263
01:22:15,323 --> 01:22:18,323
The birthday person is definitely here.

2264
01:22:18,993 --> 01:22:20,853
Stay in the car. I'll get it quickly.

2265
01:22:21,453 --> 01:22:24,492
(He moves quickly to get the cake.)

2266
01:22:24,493 --> 01:22:25,992
- Can I get this one?
- Right.

2267
01:22:25,993 --> 01:22:27,232
- I'll take that one.
- Okay.

2268
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:29,202
- It's a gift for someone.
- Right.

2269
01:22:29,203 --> 01:22:31,932
- Thank you. Bye.
- Thank you.

2270
01:22:32,403 --> 01:22:33,773
Okay. Done.

2271
01:22:34,302 --> 01:22:37,443
It's our first day together, but we're a perfect team.

2272
01:22:38,873 --> 01:22:40,142
The bread smells nice.

2273
01:22:40,712 --> 01:22:42,113
You can smell bread?

2274
01:22:44,642 --> 01:22:46,181
I think I can smell it slightly.

2275
01:22:46,182 --> 01:22:48,522
- I can smell things like donuts.
- I can smell something savory.

2276
01:22:48,523 --> 01:22:50,352
It's from your clothes.

2277
01:22:50,353 --> 01:22:51,791
- I smell donuts.
- Right.

2278
01:22:51,792 --> 01:22:53,352
- I'm serious.
- No way.

2279
01:22:53,353 --> 01:22:54,823
You two must be really hungry.

2280
01:22:55,193 --> 01:22:56,693
I want to buy a cologne that smells like that.

2281
01:22:57,123 --> 01:22:59,063
- Gosh, I'm hungry.
- We're here.

2282
01:22:59,432 --> 01:23:02,432
Can we celebrate their birthday with them...

2283
01:23:02,663 --> 01:23:04,631
and have the cake with them?

2284
01:23:04,632 --> 01:23:06,632
(Can we have the cake too?)

2285
01:23:07,233 --> 01:23:08,331
Because we're hungry?

2286
01:23:08,332 --> 01:23:10,202
- We can charge up there.
- That's a great idea.

2287
01:23:10,203 --> 01:23:11,702
It can become a greater memory...

2288
01:23:11,703 --> 01:23:13,472
- when the cake is shared.
- Right.

2289
01:23:13,773 --> 01:23:15,181
- Nice one, Seung Ho.
- That's a great idea.

2290
01:23:15,182 --> 01:23:16,341
Right.

2291
01:23:16,342 --> 01:23:19,312
(After dreaming big about winning and the cake...)

2292
01:23:19,313 --> 01:23:22,453
Did they really not get it right?

2293
01:23:22,882 --> 01:23:25,523
- I'm 100 percent certain.
- Even until now?

2294
01:23:25,722 --> 01:23:27,823
It only makes sense that way.

2295
01:23:28,252 --> 01:23:30,961
- They went somewhere else.
- No way.

2296
01:23:30,962 --> 01:23:32,862
(What is the result of Team Handsome's quiz?)

2297
01:23:32,863 --> 01:23:33,992
(Team Handsome)

2298
01:23:33,993 --> 01:23:36,732
This is what I got.

2299
01:23:36,733 --> 01:23:38,532
- It's "Blank" family.
- It's an animal that lives...

2300
01:23:38,533 --> 01:23:39,533
by the water.

2301
01:23:39,672 --> 01:23:42,042
Frogs. Turtles.

2302
01:23:42,842 --> 01:23:45,042
I still believe that Bird Family is the biggest shout.

2303
01:23:45,313 --> 01:23:47,443
You should go with what you feel is right.

2304
01:23:48,142 --> 01:23:49,483
Go with what you want.

2305
01:23:50,283 --> 01:23:51,283
Super Radical Gag Family?

2306
01:23:51,483 --> 01:23:55,181
(He wants to feel better after saying completely wrong.)

2307
01:23:55,182 --> 01:23:56,852
- What are we doing?
- After all of that discussion.

2308
01:23:56,853 --> 01:23:58,052
This is driving me crazy.

2309
01:23:58,853 --> 01:24:01,251
What a shame. We came all the way here.

2310
01:24:01,252 --> 01:24:02,692
It's a shame that we have to...

2311
01:24:02,693 --> 01:24:05,063
- go somewhere else.
- Do you know what's bad about it?

2312
01:24:05,262 --> 01:24:06,663
He had to poop on our way here.

2313
01:24:07,233 --> 01:24:09,362
He went on the unpaved road,

2314
01:24:09,363 --> 01:24:10,903
saw a bird, and did this and that.

2315
01:24:11,103 --> 01:24:12,631
Now, he's talking about the Super Radical Gag Family.

2316
01:24:12,632 --> 01:24:13,672
(Embarrassed)

2317
01:24:13,873 --> 01:24:15,072
(Jin is lost in thought.)

2318
01:24:15,073 --> 01:24:16,572
If only I didn't go to the restroom.

2319
01:24:16,573 --> 01:24:17,742
No.

2320
01:24:17,743 --> 01:24:19,172
You have to take care of your business.

2321
01:24:21,542 --> 01:24:23,181
I just saw a frog hopping around over there.

2322
01:24:23,182 --> 01:24:25,413
(I just saw a frog hopping around over there.)

2323
01:24:26,153 --> 01:24:27,353
(Hopping)

2324
01:24:28,552 --> 01:24:30,453
Wasn't that a sign from above for the answer?

2325
01:24:32,853 --> 01:24:34,891
- You should go.
- I keep looking over there.

2326
01:24:34,892 --> 01:24:36,022
You should go.

2327
01:24:36,023 --> 01:24:37,122
(The right is handed over to him right away.)

2328
01:24:37,123 --> 01:24:39,493
- I can't go.
- This is what happens.

2329
01:24:40,363 --> 01:24:42,403
- But I don't think it's "Bird." - Really?

2330
01:24:43,033 --> 01:24:44,033
"Turtle."

2331
01:24:44,403 --> 01:24:45,873
Go with what you want.

2332
01:24:46,802 --> 01:24:49,501
- What are we even talking about?
- Jin!

2333
01:24:49,502 --> 01:24:50,541
You should go for it.

2334
01:24:50,542 --> 01:24:52,041
- You should go.
- Just go for it.

2335
01:24:52,042 --> 01:24:53,171
- My gosh!
- Gosh!

2336
01:24:53,172 --> 01:24:54,341
- Gosh!
- What's wrong?

2337
01:24:54,342 --> 01:24:55,982
There was something pointy on my hand.

2338
01:24:55,983 --> 01:24:58,551
There it is. It was some kind of grasshopper.

2339
01:24:58,552 --> 01:25:00,081
- Really?
- It was a grasshopper.

2340
01:25:00,082 --> 01:25:01,283
That really got me awake.

2341
01:25:02,123 --> 01:25:03,323
- "Grasshopper Rock?" - "Grasshopper Family?"

2342
01:25:06,592 --> 01:25:07,692
It could've been saying, "It's me!"

2343
01:25:07,693 --> 01:25:08,993
It's hinting at us.

2344
01:25:09,823 --> 01:25:11,522
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

2345
01:25:11,523 --> 01:25:12,962
You'll go with "Bird" if you win.

2346
01:25:13,163 --> 01:25:14,891
He'll go with "Turtle" if he wins.

2347
01:25:14,892 --> 01:25:16,562
- I'll go with "Frog" if I win.
- Okay.

2348
01:25:16,563 --> 01:25:17,761
- Let's have no regrets.
- No regrets.

2349
01:25:17,762 --> 01:25:18,772
- No regrets.
- Okay.

2350
01:25:18,773 --> 01:25:21,573
Rock-paper-scissors.

2351
01:25:21,832 --> 01:25:23,273
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

2352
01:25:23,373 --> 01:25:24,542
(Sang Uk and "Turtle" get eliminated.)

2353
01:25:25,203 --> 01:25:26,642
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- I have to lose.

2354
01:25:27,073 --> 01:25:28,112
(I have to lose.)

2355
01:25:28,113 --> 01:25:30,112
Rock-paper-scissors.

2356
01:25:30,113 --> 01:25:31,242
(Seok Jin wins.)

2357
01:25:31,243 --> 01:25:32,252
Okay!

2358
01:25:32,582 --> 01:25:33,983
It's definitely "Turtle."

2359
01:25:34,712 --> 01:25:36,353
(Roaring)

2360
01:25:36,823 --> 01:25:38,352
Why did I have to win?

2361
01:25:38,353 --> 01:25:39,392
(Feeling so much pressure)

2362
01:25:40,722 --> 01:25:42,322
All right. Please say your answer.

2363
01:25:42,323 --> 01:25:45,221
All right. Frog Rock!

2364
01:25:45,222 --> 01:25:50,462
(Frog Rock)

2365
01:25:52,432 --> 01:25:53,502
Frog Rock.

2366
01:25:57,071 --> 01:25:58,640
All right. Frog Rock!

2367
01:25:58,641 --> 01:26:03,851
(Frog Rock)

2368
01:26:05,721 --> 01:26:06,821
Frog Rock.

2369
01:26:10,750 --> 01:26:11,750
Correct!

2370
01:26:11,751 --> 01:26:13,060
(Frog is correct!)

2371
01:26:13,061 --> 01:26:14,089
Gosh!

2372
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:15,589
(Feeling extremely happy)

2373
01:26:15,590 --> 01:26:16,730
Really?

2374
01:26:16,731 --> 01:26:17,790
Really?

2375
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:19,500
Yes. That is the correct answer.

2376
01:26:21,031 --> 01:26:22,970
- I told you!
- Gosh!

2377
01:26:22,971 --> 01:26:24,329
- Seriously?
- That was insane.

2378
01:26:24,330 --> 01:26:26,071
I said it was "Frog!"

2379
01:26:26,941 --> 01:26:28,299
What would've happened...

2380
01:26:28,300 --> 01:26:29,511
if I lost in rock-paper-scissors?

2381
01:26:29,670 --> 01:26:31,770
This makes no sense.

2382
01:26:31,771 --> 01:26:33,839
I'm feeling goosebumps all over.

2383
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:35,879
- I'm feeling goosebumps.
- Seriously.

2384
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:37,080
Here's the explanation.

2385
01:26:38,011 --> 01:26:42,191
(There's a huge rock in front of the valley.)

2386
01:26:43,290 --> 01:26:46,691
In the Gyeongsang Province, a rock is called "deom."

2387
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:49,129
From the side,

2388
01:26:49,130 --> 01:26:52,730
the rock was formed like a frog's mouth.

2389
01:26:52,731 --> 01:26:57,271
That was why the elders called that rock the Frog Deom.

2390
01:26:57,431 --> 01:27:01,540
And that was how that story was passed down.

2391
01:27:03,641 --> 01:27:04,709
One, two, three.

2392
01:27:04,710 --> 01:27:06,941
- Frog!
- Frog!

2393
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:08,480
- Okay.
- We did it.

2394
01:27:08,481 --> 01:27:09,850
(Upo Wetland)

2395
01:27:09,851 --> 01:27:11,750
- That was insane.
- The thrill was insane.

2396
01:27:11,981 --> 01:27:13,749
My heart is pounding right now.

2397
01:27:13,750 --> 01:27:15,790
- Gosh. That was great.
- Hear my heart.

2398
01:27:16,651 --> 01:27:18,550
- It's beating really fast.
- It's beating really fast.

2399
01:27:19,620 --> 01:27:21,489
- To be honest, - It's beating really fast.

2400
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:22,789
Things would go wild if he doesn't join our show.

2401
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:24,090
I can't believe this.

2402
01:27:24,330 --> 01:27:26,060
He has to carry on with this energy every week.

2403
01:27:26,061 --> 01:27:27,230
I can't believe this.

2404
01:27:27,231 --> 01:27:29,401
Don't you want to feel this thrill every week?

2405
01:27:29,731 --> 01:27:31,170
Get the sticker first!

2406
01:27:31,630 --> 01:27:33,039
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

2407
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:34,169
That was insane.

2408
01:27:34,170 --> 01:27:36,740
Thanks to Seok Jin,

2409
01:27:37,511 --> 01:27:39,580
- we now have...
- We got it done.

2410
01:27:39,910 --> 01:27:40,940
- Check this out.
- "Frog."

2411
01:27:40,941 --> 01:27:43,680
We got Changnyeong and Busan down.

2412
01:27:43,681 --> 01:27:45,280
We're secure our bingo with just Namhae.

2413
01:27:45,281 --> 01:27:46,520
(They are in the best place with just Namhae left!)

2414
01:27:46,521 --> 01:27:47,721
This feels great.

2415
01:27:48,250 --> 01:27:49,350
- Awesome!
- That was great.

2416
01:27:49,351 --> 01:27:50,549
- Seriously.
- This feels really great!

2417
01:27:50,550 --> 01:27:52,660
That was really great.

2418
01:27:55,531 --> 01:27:57,490
- Did they really not get it right?
- I'm 100 percent certain.

2419
01:27:57,931 --> 01:27:59,800
- Really?
- Oh, right.

2420
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:01,730
(Cuckoo)

2421
01:28:01,731 --> 01:28:04,401
- Right.
- Changnyeong, Upo Wetland.

2422
01:28:04,771 --> 01:28:06,700
- All right.
- They occupied Upo Wetland?

2423
01:28:07,000 --> 01:28:08,941
Where do you think they will go next?

2424
01:28:09,410 --> 01:28:10,610
They will definitely go to Namhae.

2425
01:28:10,611 --> 01:28:11,709
- Namhae?
- Of course.

2426
01:28:11,710 --> 01:28:12,839
(An ominous feeling surrounds them all of a sudden.)

2427
01:28:12,840 --> 01:28:14,481
Then we'll meet them there.

2428
01:28:16,580 --> 01:28:17,610
Right.

2429
01:28:17,611 --> 01:28:19,481
(Using all of his brain power)

2430
01:28:20,351 --> 01:28:21,919
We're in trouble then.

2431
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:23,150
(Emergency situation for Team Guys)

2432
01:28:23,151 --> 01:28:24,521
If they go to Namhae from here...

2433
01:28:24,950 --> 01:28:26,659
How long does it take from Changnyeong to Namhae?

2434
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:27,990
It takes 2 hours and 5 minutes.

2435
01:28:28,061 --> 01:28:32,031
We'll take 1 hour 15 minutes to get to Namhae from Jinju.

2436
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:33,560
When we take the quiz in Jinju,

2437
01:28:33,561 --> 01:28:35,030
we have to take a 30-minute nap.

2438
01:28:35,031 --> 01:28:36,570
Won't it be dangerous for us?

2439
01:28:36,571 --> 01:28:38,970
We must move quickly no matter what.

2440
01:28:38,971 --> 01:28:40,100
We have no time.

2441
01:28:40,101 --> 01:28:42,111
- Are we here?
- It's over there.

2442
01:28:42,271 --> 01:28:43,471
We have no time.

2443
01:28:44,340 --> 01:28:45,539
We must hurry.

2444
01:28:45,540 --> 01:28:46,641
(To occupy Namhae first)

2445
01:28:46,811 --> 01:28:48,080
It's a race against time.

2446
01:28:48,781 --> 01:28:50,409
Right, we must be diligent.

2447
01:28:50,410 --> 01:28:53,021
We plan to arrive in Namhae in two hours.

2448
01:28:53,321 --> 01:28:54,420
We must move diligently.

2449
01:28:54,781 --> 01:28:56,050
Let me see how long it takes from here.

2450
01:28:57,021 --> 01:28:58,120
One hour and 17 minutes.

2451
01:28:58,920 --> 01:29:00,761
It takes a long time. Goodness.

2452
01:29:01,891 --> 01:29:03,290
What if we have to work?

2453
01:29:04,460 --> 01:29:06,330
How about we pass...

2454
01:29:06,460 --> 01:29:08,231
this one and go straight to Namhae?

2455
01:29:08,601 --> 01:29:10,370
We have to calculate time for our nap.

2456
01:29:11,031 --> 01:29:13,101
It's better that we skip here. What do we do?

2457
01:29:13,401 --> 01:29:14,539
That's the only way.

2458
01:29:14,540 --> 01:29:15,909
We have a better chance of winning that way.

2459
01:29:15,910 --> 01:29:17,571
(Will they give up Jinju?)

2460
01:29:18,040 --> 01:29:19,680
- What should we do?
- We must decide.

2461
01:29:19,681 --> 01:29:22,981
(What will Team Guys choose?)

2462
01:29:23,111 --> 01:29:24,909
(If we occupy Namhae in Namhae, )

2463
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:26,150
(then it's game over.)

2464
01:29:26,151 --> 01:29:28,919
(They must win Namhae to finish the bingo.)

2465
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:31,989
(To avoid the penalty work, )

2466
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:34,920
(Namhae Battle starts.)

2467
01:29:35,061 --> 01:29:38,459
(A long way to Namhae)

2468
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:40,260
(However, the biggest problem is)

2469
01:29:40,261 --> 01:29:43,370
(Extreme starving)

2470
01:29:43,670 --> 01:29:45,940
(Who would eat at the thought of working?)

2471
01:29:45,941 --> 01:29:48,500
(They must stay alert until the end.)

2472
01:29:48,740 --> 01:29:51,370
(The hidden treasure race hasn't ended.)

2473
01:29:51,540 --> 01:29:53,579
(It's overwhelming.)

2474
01:29:53,580 --> 01:29:57,150
(Their first game of bingo with many twists)

2475
01:29:57,151 --> 01:30:00,050
(Which team will be the first to complete a bingo?)

2476
