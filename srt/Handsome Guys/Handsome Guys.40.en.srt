(Life in Shortage as a new concept?)

3
00:00:20,716 --> 00:00:22,385
(Do you mean tribe?)

4
00:00:22,386 --> 00:00:24,331
(No!)

5
00:00:24,405 --> 00:00:25,874
(Handsome Guys' new concept)

6
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,645
(Life in Shortage)

7
00:00:28,715 --> 00:00:31,185
Wait a minute. You don't mean "tribe."

8
00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:32,878
- Like in shortage? - Hey.

9
00:00:33,255 --> 00:00:34,255
(That's how it started.)

10
00:00:34,256 --> 00:00:36,655
(Shortage in air conditioner)

11
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:39,185
(A survival story to unfold at 37°C)

12
00:00:39,385 --> 00:00:40,895
(We're in the middle of a heat wave.)

13
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:42,765
(In a daze)

14
00:00:42,925 --> 00:00:44,365
Gosh, it's hot.

15
00:00:44,565 --> 00:00:47,494
(On a hot day when simply sitting still makes you sweat)

16
00:00:47,495 --> 00:00:49,664
(An outdoor charcoal barbecue)

17
00:00:49,665 --> 00:00:51,105
(Unpleasant)

18
00:00:51,605 --> 00:00:56,705
(Handsome Guys are desperate to escape the heat.)

19
00:00:57,045 --> 00:01:00,574
(Please turn on the air conditioner.)

20
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:03,345
(Chance 1 to escape the shortage and turn on the air conditioner)

21
00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:04,584
It's Lia.

22
00:01:04,585 --> 00:01:06,584
(Learning from Lia Kim)

23
00:01:06,585 --> 00:01:08,715
(A dance challenge)

24
00:01:09,555 --> 00:01:11,085
(If they succeed, they can use the air conditioner.)

25
00:01:12,285 --> 00:01:15,625
(Handsome Guys practiced without a pause in the heat.)

26
00:01:16,425 --> 00:01:19,325
(What was the result?)

27
00:01:19,465 --> 00:01:20,795
(Completely satisfied)

28
00:01:21,265 --> 00:01:23,204
(Using the air conditioner for 30 minutes)

29
00:01:23,205 --> 00:01:25,135
(30 minutes of the air conditioner was a fleeting moment.)

30
00:01:25,235 --> 00:01:27,375
(In despair)

31
00:01:30,805 --> 00:01:33,114
(The sound of modern life returns.)

32
00:01:33,115 --> 00:01:34,214
(Air conditioner)

33
00:01:34,215 --> 00:01:36,185
(Cold Room entrance quiz)

34
00:01:36,545 --> 00:01:38,785
(An intense battle for the air conditioner between the tribes)

35
00:01:39,555 --> 00:01:42,254
(Physical 100)

36
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:44,885
(Brain 0)

37
00:01:45,785 --> 00:01:48,095
(Infinite heat when you're incorrect)

38
00:01:48,355 --> 00:01:50,324
(When you get it right)

39
00:01:50,325 --> 00:01:52,165
(Cold Room)

40
00:01:52,465 --> 00:01:54,435
(Civilization is the best.)

41
00:01:54,565 --> 00:01:55,834
Your time in the Cold Room is over.

42
00:01:55,835 --> 00:02:00,135
(The civilized experience ended helplessly.)

43
00:02:00,605 --> 00:02:05,775
(Shortage of air conditioner is back with heat.)

44
00:02:06,245 --> 00:02:10,545
(Soon, the day is coming to an end.)

45
00:02:12,245 --> 00:02:13,384
Everyone.

46
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:14,515
- Yes? - Yes?

47
00:02:14,755 --> 00:02:17,354
A team game will start with eating out...

48
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:18,424
Korean beef on the line.

49
00:02:18,425 --> 00:02:19,724
- "Eating out?" - Are we going out?

50
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:20,855
- You'll go out to eat. - Korean beef?

51
00:02:20,925 --> 00:02:22,425
- Air conditioner. - Air conditioner.

52
00:02:22,495 --> 00:02:24,064
Once you come out to the yard, we'll start.

53
00:02:24,065 --> 00:02:25,094
- Okay. - Please.

54
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:26,095
I won't mess around.

55
00:02:26,096 --> 00:02:28,134
This isn't an individual game. It's a team game.

56
00:02:28,135 --> 00:02:29,604
(At 29°C, 83 percent of humidity)

57
00:02:29,605 --> 00:02:31,304
(Taking place at night in the sweltering heat of midsummer)

58
00:02:31,305 --> 00:02:33,334
You can enjoy both air conditioner and Korean beef.

59
00:02:33,335 --> 00:02:34,335
- It's a team game. - Okay.

60
00:02:34,336 --> 00:02:35,434
Let's eat out.

61
00:02:35,435 --> 00:02:36,744
- We can eat out. - Let's eat out.

62
00:02:36,745 --> 00:02:38,505
I prefer the air conditioner.

63
00:02:39,105 --> 00:02:42,314
Each person will run up to the line.

64
00:02:42,315 --> 00:02:44,314
All five of you must get inside the box...

65
00:02:44,315 --> 00:02:46,115
and hold it for five seconds to succeed.

66
00:02:46,415 --> 00:02:47,454
What?

67
00:02:47,455 --> 00:02:48,585
Wait a minute.

68
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:50,124
Let's see if all of us fit.

69
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:52,155
Can we step on the line?

70
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:53,994
- Is that not allowed? - You can't step on the line.

71
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:55,354
- You must be within the line. - Like this?

72
00:02:55,355 --> 00:02:56,364
Try it.

73
00:02:56,365 --> 00:02:57,564
- It's impossible. - Give it a try.

74
00:02:57,565 --> 00:02:58,595
Try it.

75
00:02:59,225 --> 00:03:00,664
(Everyone's warmth gets together on a hot night.)

76
00:03:00,665 --> 00:03:02,394
- There's no space. - Sang Uk.

77
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:03,934
(Cramped)

78
00:03:03,935 --> 00:03:05,104
Sang Uk, come in...

79
00:03:05,105 --> 00:03:06,735
and hug everyone tightly.

80
00:03:07,005 --> 00:03:09,275
- Is this possible? - Is it possible?

81
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:11,145
(Bursting out laughing)

82
00:03:11,575 --> 00:03:12,874
- Time-out. - Hey.

83
00:03:12,875 --> 00:03:13,974
(Everyone collapses.)

84
00:03:13,975 --> 00:03:14,975
- Time-out. - For now...

85
00:03:14,976 --> 00:03:16,414
That was a total failure.

86
00:03:16,415 --> 00:03:17,714
We can't even do it without moving.

87
00:03:17,715 --> 00:03:18,844
How is this possible?

88
00:03:18,845 --> 00:03:21,855
I bet those who weigh 60kg did a test.

89
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:24,824
This is smaller than I thought.

90
00:03:24,825 --> 00:03:26,495
How many times can we try?

91
00:03:26,695 --> 00:03:28,695
- You get three chances. - Three chances?

92
00:03:29,225 --> 00:03:30,694
Look at the distance.

93
00:03:30,695 --> 00:03:31,895
(Practicing to check the distance)

94
00:03:33,195 --> 00:03:34,294
(He fails to land.)

95
00:03:34,295 --> 00:03:35,335
Goodness.

96
00:03:36,605 --> 00:03:38,965
- I can make it from here. - Try to stop yourself.

97
00:03:39,465 --> 00:03:41,134
(He barely makes it.)

98
00:03:41,135 --> 00:03:42,275
You can do it.

99
00:03:42,475 --> 00:03:43,644
It's impossible.

100
00:03:43,645 --> 00:03:46,174
I can tell the outcome...

101
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:48,114
- just by looking at the game. - Let's try to be hopeful.

102
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:49,174
Okay, he's right.

103
00:03:49,175 --> 00:03:50,984
I understand that this game is impossible.

104
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:52,614
- Let's be hopeful. - Let's try to think.

105
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:54,654
- What should we do? - Let's try to think hopefully.

106
00:03:54,655 --> 00:03:56,214
Should I go first...

107
00:03:56,215 --> 00:03:57,324
- and take everyone on my back? - He should carry someone light...

108
00:03:57,325 --> 00:03:58,954
- like Tae Hyun on your back. - Should I carry Tae Hyun?

109
00:03:58,955 --> 00:04:00,194
Carrying someone on the back won't work.

110
00:04:00,195 --> 00:04:02,225
Someone's torso will be out of the line.

111
00:04:02,355 --> 00:04:03,825
We need enough space for the feet.

112
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:06,125
Who cares? The top will be too big.

113
00:04:07,795 --> 00:04:08,964
Since Sang Uk can do it,

114
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:10,604
he should block everyone to stay within the line.

115
00:04:10,605 --> 00:04:12,834
- From the back like this? - Sang Uk should go in first...

116
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:14,134
and block everyone.

117
00:04:14,135 --> 00:04:16,204
- It's utterly impossible. - He can hug them.

118
00:04:16,205 --> 00:04:17,644
Stop saying that it's impossible.

119
00:04:17,645 --> 00:04:19,475
- Try to make it work. - Listen to me.

120
00:04:19,605 --> 00:04:20,944
- I'm very objective... - You keep saying it's impossible.

121
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:23,414
- when I look at games. - Let's give it a try.

122
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:25,114
It's worth trying when the winning rate is 30 percent,

123
00:04:25,115 --> 00:04:26,814
but this is less than three percent.

124
00:04:26,815 --> 00:04:28,314
- No, it's zero percent. - Let's still try it.

125
00:04:28,315 --> 00:04:30,884
We need support both in the front and back to stay balanced.

126
00:04:30,885 --> 00:04:32,425
(The space is too small to hold still.)

127
00:04:33,725 --> 00:04:36,494
Sang Uk should support us first.

128
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:37,894
(They need a different strategy.)

129
00:04:37,895 --> 00:04:39,324
By the way...

130
00:04:39,325 --> 00:04:40,694
Dong Hyun.

131
00:04:40,695 --> 00:04:42,535
It might be better that I go last.

132
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:44,965
Okay.

133
00:04:45,505 --> 00:04:46,835
- Do you want to go last? - Yes.

134
00:04:47,335 --> 00:04:49,844
(Sang Uk radiates a sense of inexplicable confidence.)

135
00:04:49,845 --> 00:04:51,175
We have three chances.

136
00:04:51,305 --> 00:04:52,975
We can make it better after our first attempt.

137
00:04:53,115 --> 00:04:54,144
We can make it better as we go.

138
00:04:54,145 --> 00:04:55,474
- First of all... - Shall we go?

139
00:04:55,475 --> 00:04:56,844
Shouldn't chunky ones start first?

140
00:04:56,845 --> 00:04:57,845
- That's right. - Okay.

141
00:04:57,846 --> 00:04:59,984
Seung Ho and Dong Hyun should go in first...

142
00:04:59,985 --> 00:05:00,985
- and catch the others. - Exactly.

143
00:05:00,986 --> 00:05:02,585
Tae Hyun and I will go in next.

144
00:05:02,855 --> 00:05:04,184
Shall we start now?

145
00:05:04,185 --> 00:05:05,684
- Okay. - Let's do a cheer.

146
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:06,824
- Start. Air conditioner... - Air conditioner...

147
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:07,995
- and Korean beef, let's go. - and Korean beef, let's go.

148
00:05:09,425 --> 00:05:12,964
(1st try)

149
00:05:12,965 --> 00:05:14,794
- Shall we start? - I'll go first.

150
00:05:14,795 --> 00:05:15,895
- Starting. - Okay.

151
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:19,805
Okay.

152
00:05:20,535 --> 00:05:22,935
(Number 1 is safe.)

153
00:05:24,005 --> 00:05:25,544
- You can also be on your toes. - By the way...

154
00:05:25,545 --> 00:05:26,614
- That's fine. - Okay.

155
00:05:26,615 --> 00:05:28,515
By the way, it's really slippery.

156
00:05:28,915 --> 00:05:30,614
- Be careful. - It'll be easy up to me.

157
00:05:30,615 --> 00:05:32,285
- Should I leave this area empty? - Let's catch each other.

158
00:05:32,385 --> 00:05:34,115
Grab me with this hand.

159
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:36,114
- That's right. - Shall I stop you from going out?

160
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:37,484
Just in case.

161
00:05:37,485 --> 00:05:39,725
For example...

162
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:41,954
Gently like this.

163
00:05:41,955 --> 00:05:42,994
(Number 2 is safe.)

164
00:05:42,995 --> 00:05:44,124
- And... - Now,

165
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,064
we should put our feet here and block the others.

166
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:47,194
Jump between where they're standing.

167
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:49,295
Think of jumping towards us. We'll stop you.

168
00:05:49,805 --> 00:05:51,264
(Building a solid defense line...)

169
00:05:51,265 --> 00:05:52,735
(and securing space)

170
00:05:52,965 --> 00:05:54,204
Jump between where they're standing.

171
00:05:54,205 --> 00:05:55,734
- They'll stop you. - Think of jumping towards us.

172
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:56,335
Okay.

173
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:59,275
- Grab them quickly. - Put your feet here.

174
00:05:59,775 --> 00:06:02,014
(Cha Tae Hyun is...)

175
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:03,514
(thrown.)

176
00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:04,815
Put your feet here.

177
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:06,115
(Grunting)

178
00:06:06,915 --> 00:06:08,314
Okay, we got it.

179
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:09,315
No, wait.

180
00:06:09,316 --> 00:06:11,284
- How can I go in next? - Wait.

181
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:12,285
- Settle down. - Take your time.

182
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:13,294
- Okay, settle down first. - Take your time.

183
00:06:13,295 --> 00:06:14,594
Settle down first. Wait a minute.

184
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:15,794
- Put your arm on the other side. - Wait.

185
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:17,164
- Slowly. - We need to make space.

186
00:06:17,165 --> 00:06:19,695
Wait, Tae Hyun. I have to look.

187
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:22,965
- Put both of your hands. - No.

188
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:24,304
- Like this. - Like this?

189
00:06:24,305 --> 00:06:25,704
That's good.

190
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:27,305
- Wait a minute. - That's good.

191
00:06:27,505 --> 00:06:29,405
- Wait. - Tell me when you're ready.

192
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:31,144
- All right. - Your feet.

193
00:06:31,145 --> 00:06:32,705
(While feeling each other's warmth)

194
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:33,874
Your spacing is good.

195
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,244
(A considerably expanded space)

196
00:06:35,245 --> 00:06:36,885
- All right. It's mine. - Whose foot is it?

197
00:06:37,085 --> 00:06:38,085
Shall I go?

198
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:39,414
Wait. If Tae Hyun pushes out his buttocks...

199
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:40,415
- Okay. - Don't start right away.

200
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,314
I don't want to fall. Please stop me.

201
00:06:42,315 --> 00:06:43,655
- Of course. - Okay.

202
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:45,254
Come prepared,

203
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:47,394
knowing that we can support you the least possible.

204
00:06:47,395 --> 00:06:48,395
I'll jump...

205
00:06:48,396 --> 00:06:50,325
- towards them. - Okay, try it.

206
00:06:50,625 --> 00:06:53,135
Tae Hyun, Yi Kyung is coming.

207
00:06:53,465 --> 00:06:54,495
Here I go.

208
00:06:54,565 --> 00:06:57,305
(Number 4, Lee Yi Kyung)

209
00:06:57,405 --> 00:06:59,065
Jump up.

210
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:01,805
(Exclaiming)

211
00:07:01,806 --> 00:07:03,205
Jump up.

212
00:07:03,475 --> 00:07:05,004
(Shaking)

213
00:07:05,005 --> 00:07:06,205
- We got it. - Goodness.

214
00:07:06,915 --> 00:07:08,615
(Grabbing)

215
00:07:09,885 --> 00:07:11,014
- Stay still. - We got it.

216
00:07:11,015 --> 00:07:12,545
- Wait a minute. - Stay still.

217
00:07:12,945 --> 00:07:14,155
You got it.

218
00:07:14,285 --> 00:07:16,315
- Slowly. Wait a minute. - Okay.

219
00:07:16,555 --> 00:07:17,954
(What remains is...)

220
00:07:17,955 --> 00:07:20,255
(Number 5, Oh Sang Uk.)

221
00:07:20,725 --> 00:07:23,294
(They're likely to collapse with a single push from Sang Uk.)

222
00:07:23,295 --> 00:07:25,294
- Stay still. - Wait a minute.

223
00:07:25,295 --> 00:07:26,735
Stay still. Slowly.

224
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:29,565
(There isn't enough space for him to run into it.)

225
00:07:29,905 --> 00:07:32,005
- Stay still. - Okay.

226
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,535
- Okay. - Stay still.

227
00:07:37,775 --> 00:07:40,145
(He's supposed to jump.)

228
00:07:40,715 --> 00:07:43,514
(Sang Uk volunteered to go last.)

229
00:07:43,515 --> 00:07:46,615
As you know, I'm a fencer.

230
00:07:47,015 --> 00:07:48,414
I can split my legs.

231
00:07:48,415 --> 00:07:50,785
I can put down one of my feet and come in like this.

232
00:07:51,155 --> 00:07:52,455
I'll go last.

233
00:07:55,225 --> 00:07:56,894
(The staff had forgotten.)

234
00:07:56,895 --> 00:08:00,134
When it comes to physical tasks, I can do the work of three people.

235
00:08:00,135 --> 00:08:02,264
- Wait a minute. - Stay still.

236
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:03,265
Wait.

237
00:08:03,266 --> 00:08:04,905
- My upper body... - There's no need to hurry.

238
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:06,134
- Can you hold it? - Wait.

239
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:08,804
There's no need to hurry.

240
00:08:08,805 --> 00:08:10,644
- Stay still. We're in no hurry. - Okay.

241
00:08:10,645 --> 00:08:12,404
- There's no need to hurry. - Move up your foot, Yi Kyung.

242
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:14,315
Slowly. There's no need to hurry.

243
00:08:16,175 --> 00:08:18,015
Slowly. There's no need to hurry.

244
00:08:18,615 --> 00:08:20,114
- Start counting. - We got it.

245
00:08:20,115 --> 00:08:21,185
- Two. - One,

246
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:22,515
two,

247
00:08:22,855 --> 00:08:24,385
three, four.

248
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,024
You're stepping on the line. You're disqualified.

249
00:08:27,025 --> 00:08:28,325
- Who? - Who?

250
00:08:29,255 --> 00:08:31,264
Wait, I understand.

251
00:08:31,265 --> 00:08:34,065
I accept that I stepped on the line. Wait.

252
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:35,634
You know what?

253
00:08:35,635 --> 00:08:37,334
- You should've told me... - This is possible.

254
00:08:37,335 --> 00:08:39,764
when I was standing here like this.

255
00:08:39,765 --> 00:08:41,205
That was the right thing to do.

256
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:43,674
Why did you wait until we held it for five seconds?

257
00:08:43,675 --> 00:08:45,275
You got all flustered and pointed out...

258
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:47,715
- that I stepped on the line... - It's possible.

259
00:08:47,915 --> 00:08:49,544
What's important is that it's possible.

260
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:50,784
We have two more attempts.

261
00:08:50,785 --> 00:08:51,945
- We can do this. - Is it possible?

262
00:08:51,985 --> 00:08:53,285
We can do this.

263
00:08:53,855 --> 00:08:55,914
- Okay, you're right. - It's possible.

264
00:08:55,915 --> 00:08:57,025
- We can do this. - Okay.

265
00:08:57,685 --> 00:09:00,624
Instead of thinking that it's simply possible,

266
00:09:00,625 --> 00:09:02,594
- let's do it out of desperation. - Of course.

267
00:09:02,595 --> 00:09:03,624
We must do it no matter what.

268
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:04,824
Shall we do a cheer?

269
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:06,225
- Let's do it. - Let's do a cheer.

270
00:09:06,365 --> 00:09:08,264
We're this close to getting the air conditioner and Korean beef.

271
00:09:08,265 --> 00:09:09,934
- Okay. - For the air conditioner and beef.

272
00:09:09,935 --> 00:09:11,765
- For the air conditioner. - And Korean beef.

273
00:09:12,065 --> 00:09:13,334
- Let's go. - We're perfectly in sync.

274
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:14,374
- We got this. - This is great.

275
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:15,905
- Do I go in second? - It builds a sense of unity.

276
00:09:16,335 --> 00:09:17,644
It's really hot right now.

277
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:18,875
(Number 1, Shin Seung Ho)

278
00:09:19,445 --> 00:09:20,515
Just don't step on the line.

279
00:09:21,615 --> 00:09:22,944
That's good.

280
00:09:22,945 --> 00:09:24,614
- That was a great angle. - Get yourself settled down.

281
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:26,914
- Wait, we're not in a hurry. - No, we have no time limit.

282
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:29,754
You don't have to be extremely close to the line.

283
00:09:29,755 --> 00:09:31,884
Or it could lead to controversy.

284
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:33,154
- Leave some room to spare. - You don't have to be so close.

285
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,955
Let me ask in advance. Is this okay?

286
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:37,224
- It's unclear. - That's fine.

287
00:09:37,225 --> 00:09:38,824
- Okay. - On this side...

288
00:09:38,825 --> 00:09:40,694
I'm not going to move from here.

289
00:09:40,695 --> 00:09:41,834
He said that this is fine.

290
00:09:41,835 --> 00:09:43,534
We'll ask every time someone comes in.

291
00:09:43,535 --> 00:09:44,734
- Okay. - Here I come.

292
00:09:44,735 --> 00:09:46,335
(Number 2, Kim Dong Hyun)

293
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,375
Gosh.

294
00:09:49,605 --> 00:09:52,174
- Gosh, what's the matter? - I got it.

295
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:53,845
- I got it. - All right.

296
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:55,844
(They're being watched.)

297
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,414
- Be careful from now on. - Take your time.

298
00:09:57,415 --> 00:09:58,814
- All right. - Don't sweat it.

299
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:00,914
Dong Hyun, could you move a little? Our toes are...

300
00:10:00,915 --> 00:10:02,254
- What should I do? - That's good.

301
00:10:02,255 --> 00:10:04,355
- Your toes could cross the line. - Is this okay?

302
00:10:04,585 --> 00:10:05,684
That's okay right now.

303
00:10:05,685 --> 00:10:06,695
(That's okay.)

304
00:10:06,995 --> 00:10:08,624
Tae Hyun, what did you do a moment ago?

305
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,294
You grab our waists. We'll grab your head.

306
00:10:10,295 --> 00:10:12,164
- Grab your waists? - You have to support him.

307
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:14,234
(He flies like a butterfly again this time.)

308
00:10:14,235 --> 00:10:16,194
(He runs gently into their arms.)

309
00:10:16,195 --> 00:10:18,204
- That's good. - Put your hands close together.

310
00:10:18,205 --> 00:10:19,434
Put your hands between us.

311
00:10:19,435 --> 00:10:21,704
Put them up high. No, there isn't any space.

312
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:22,804
- Put them up? - Yes.

313
00:10:22,805 --> 00:10:25,175
- Put them between our heads. - Don't move your feet.

314
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:26,814
Wait a minute.

315
00:10:26,815 --> 00:10:28,214
- Wait, Tae Hyun. - Put the other hand here.

316
00:10:28,215 --> 00:10:29,345
Don't move.

317
00:10:29,715 --> 00:10:32,185
All right.

318
00:10:32,285 --> 00:10:34,185
Tae Hyun, step on my foot like you did last time.

319
00:10:34,515 --> 00:10:35,714
It's okay.

320
00:10:35,715 --> 00:10:37,285
All right, are we okay now?

321
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:38,854
Is this okay?

322
00:10:38,855 --> 00:10:40,255
- Yes, it's okay. - Okay.

323
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,495
Okay.

324
00:10:44,565 --> 00:10:45,565
Am I good to go?

325
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:46,934
- Have you settled down? - Yes.

326
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:47,935
Okay.

327
00:10:47,936 --> 00:10:49,895
(Number 4, Lee Yi Kyung)

328
00:10:50,065 --> 00:10:51,105
(A heavy thud)

329
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:53,064
- This is good. - It's okay.

330
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:54,374
- It's good. - It's okay.

331
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,375
Wait a minute.

332
00:10:55,376 --> 00:10:56,844
- Your hands. - We're not in a hurry.

333
00:10:56,845 --> 00:10:58,804
- Hands. - Wait, we're not in a hurry.

334
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:00,115
Are we okay like this?

335
00:11:01,275 --> 00:11:02,375
Are we okay?

336
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,414
- Right now? - You're okay.

337
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:06,114
We're okay. Take your time.

338
00:11:06,115 --> 00:11:08,154
Sang Uk, your feet must go inside in one go.

339
00:11:08,155 --> 00:11:09,155
Okay.

340
00:11:13,185 --> 00:11:14,724
Okay, you've got it.

341
00:11:14,725 --> 00:11:15,794
- Oh, my. - You've got this.

342
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:17,664
My hand is over here.

343
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:21,034
- Don't depend on us. Do it slowly. - One, two.

344
00:11:21,035 --> 00:11:22,394
We have to pull him. That's good.

345
00:11:22,395 --> 00:11:23,904
- We got it. - I'll start counting.

346
00:11:23,905 --> 00:11:26,034
- One, two, - We got it.

347
00:11:26,035 --> 00:11:28,934
- three, four. - We need to hold it longer...

348
00:11:28,935 --> 00:11:30,105
so that there's no controversy.

349
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:34,144
Hold it longer.

350
00:11:34,145 --> 00:11:36,375
Hold it until we're qualified.

351
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:38,084
- Hold it longer. - Until the end.

352
00:11:38,085 --> 00:11:39,085
Hold it...

353
00:11:39,086 --> 00:11:40,315
until he says okay.

354
00:11:40,815 --> 00:11:42,855
- Success. - We got it.

355
00:11:43,015 --> 00:11:44,254
(They win the chance to eat out and have Korean beef.)

356
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,325
This is amazing.

357
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:48,554
We held it for about ten seconds.

358
00:11:48,555 --> 00:11:49,695
We held it for ten seconds.

359
00:11:50,265 --> 00:11:52,624
- Right? - He's tall indeed.

360
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,435
- We got it. - Sang Uk, how did you do it?

361
00:11:54,895 --> 00:11:55,934
How did you do it, Sang Uk?

362
00:11:55,935 --> 00:11:57,264
This is my specialty.

363
00:11:57,265 --> 00:11:58,964
How is this possible?

364
00:11:58,965 --> 00:12:00,134
- In the world... - How did you do it?

365
00:12:00,135 --> 00:12:01,275
I didn't get to see you.

366
00:12:01,735 --> 00:12:02,735
How did he do it?

367
00:12:03,035 --> 00:12:04,045
This is...

368
00:12:05,305 --> 00:12:06,974
Pull the other foot in. One, two, three.

369
00:12:06,975 --> 00:12:08,875
- I can do it alone. - Alone?

370
00:12:09,445 --> 00:12:10,445
By myself.

371
00:12:11,985 --> 00:12:14,155
- That's impossible. - Is that even possible?

372
00:12:14,185 --> 00:12:15,214
That's impossible.

373
00:12:15,215 --> 00:12:16,885
(Tae Hyun tries it himself.)

374
00:12:17,285 --> 00:12:18,654
Can you try to do it by yourself?

375
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:20,424
(The length isn't long enough.)

376
00:12:20,425 --> 00:12:21,425
Is this possible?

377
00:12:21,426 --> 00:12:23,464
I can take a step up to here.

378
00:12:23,465 --> 00:12:25,294
Can you pull yourself in?

379
00:12:25,295 --> 00:12:26,295
(Dong Hyun can stretch out his leg up to the rectangle.)

380
00:12:27,295 --> 00:12:28,864
(Locked)

381
00:12:28,865 --> 00:12:29,895
This is...

382
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:31,765
My other foot won't budge.

383
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:34,405
We succeeded thanks to Sang Uk.

384
00:12:35,135 --> 00:12:36,374
- He's different. - It's my specialty.

385
00:12:36,375 --> 00:12:38,774
Sang Uk's playing last was the stroke of genius.

386
00:12:38,775 --> 00:12:41,044
- That's certain. - The length was possible.

387
00:12:41,045 --> 00:12:42,614
- Everyone, since you succeeded, - That was amazing.

388
00:12:42,615 --> 00:12:45,585
you'll head to a restaurant that's fully air-conditioned.

389
00:12:45,885 --> 00:12:47,554
- That's the best. - Okay.

390
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:49,015
- This is insane. - It's unbelievable.

391
00:12:49,515 --> 00:12:51,454
- Let's go. - We got it thanks to Sang Uk.

392
00:12:51,455 --> 00:12:54,825
(We didn't expect them to succeed.)

393
00:12:56,155 --> 00:12:58,224
When I go home tomorrow after work,

394
00:12:58,225 --> 00:12:59,725
I'll be able to sleep for 24 hours.

395
00:13:00,165 --> 00:13:01,395
By the way,

396
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:03,195
we're still shooting, right?

397
00:13:03,905 --> 00:13:05,604
(Fiddling)

398
00:13:05,605 --> 00:13:07,675
- Is it a candid camera? - It feels like...

399
00:13:08,035 --> 00:13:09,275
Since it's our first time,

400
00:13:09,605 --> 00:13:11,005
we did a lot of preparation.

401
00:13:12,245 --> 00:13:13,305
Is there something in the back?

402
00:13:14,575 --> 00:13:15,645
What are you shooting?

403
00:13:16,615 --> 00:13:17,845
I know what it is.

404
00:13:18,015 --> 00:13:19,485
- Show it to him later. - Okay.

405
00:13:19,845 --> 00:13:20,985
That's Yi Kyung.

406
00:13:21,585 --> 00:13:22,655
I knew it.

407
00:13:23,725 --> 00:13:27,495
(He turned on the seat heating.)

408
00:13:28,595 --> 00:13:29,895
I was wondering why it felt warm.

409
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:33,424
It was for a short while.

410
00:13:33,425 --> 00:13:35,095
(With a cute revenge)

411
00:13:35,735 --> 00:13:37,665
It's about time that we got very hungry.

412
00:13:37,835 --> 00:13:39,604
It's 8:34pm,

413
00:13:39,605 --> 00:13:41,074
the time when Korean beef tastes the best.

414
00:13:41,075 --> 00:13:42,235
(The time when Korean beef tastes the best?)

415
00:13:43,005 --> 00:13:44,105
It has nice reviews.

416
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:46,074
- It was rated high. - Goodness.

417
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,515
It looks so fancy.

418
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:50,514
- Please enjoy your meal. - Thank you.

419
00:13:50,515 --> 00:13:51,784
- This is precious. - Let's go inside.

420
00:13:51,785 --> 00:13:54,584
The restaurant looks very fancy.

421
00:13:54,585 --> 00:13:56,615
This feels like paradise.

422
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,485
No more talking. Just crank up the air conditioner.

423
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:01,124
- Hello. - It's fully air-conditioned.

424
00:14:01,125 --> 00:14:02,454
- Hello. - This feels nice.

425
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:03,564
- Hello. - It's fully air-conditioned.

426
00:14:03,565 --> 00:14:04,665
Hello.

427
00:14:04,995 --> 00:14:07,234
What is this place? The server will grill it for us.

428
00:14:07,235 --> 00:14:08,264
(Enjoying Korean beef under dream-like air conditioning)

429
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:10,165
I can't believe how cool it is. It's so refreshing.

430
00:14:10,535 --> 00:14:12,365
(He looks at the menu first.)

431
00:14:12,605 --> 00:14:13,605
"Pine nut beef?"

432
00:14:13,905 --> 00:14:16,175
- Hello. - Hello.

433
00:14:16,435 --> 00:14:19,274
- There's pine nut beef on the menu. - Right.

434
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,414
What is "pine nut beef?"

435
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,514
There are many pine nut forests here.

436
00:14:22,515 --> 00:14:25,815
These are healthy cattle raised with the phytoncides in the air.

437
00:14:26,215 --> 00:14:28,214
- Clean cattle in Gapyeong? - That's correct.

438
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:31,084
We're going to taste everything in a row.

439
00:14:31,085 --> 00:14:34,724
Can we start with special sirloin and chuck flap tail?

440
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:37,294
If it's thin skirt, shall we also order thin flank?

441
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:38,395
That sounds good.

442
00:14:39,065 --> 00:14:40,194
- Look at the meat. - Here's your order.

443
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:42,635
- It looks very high in quality. - This is sirloin.

444
00:14:42,695 --> 00:14:44,234
This is chuck flap tail.

445
00:14:44,235 --> 00:14:45,464
Look at how thick it is.

446
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:46,764
- It's very high in quality. - It looks amazing.

447
00:14:46,765 --> 00:14:47,774
Thank you.

448
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:49,374
- I'll grill the sirloin first. - Okay.

449
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:50,574
(All the credit goes to Sang Uk.)

450
00:14:50,575 --> 00:14:52,174
We get to eat thanks to Sang Uk.

451
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:54,044
- That's right. - Thank you for the food, Sang Uk.

452
00:14:54,045 --> 00:14:55,644
- Seriously. Thanks, Sang Uk. - Thank you.

453
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,885
Our staff members probably tested it 100 times.

454
00:14:58,245 --> 00:15:00,144
I bet no one was as tall as Sang Uk.

455
00:15:00,145 --> 00:15:03,155
They probably thought about taking a run-up and jumping.

456
00:15:03,555 --> 00:15:04,985
Sang Uk is good at everything except quizzes.

457
00:15:06,925 --> 00:15:09,355
Right. We failed to go into the Cold Room,

458
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:10,724
but thanks to Sang Uk...

459
00:15:10,725 --> 00:15:14,265
This is why teamwork is important.

460
00:15:14,795 --> 00:15:16,795
- I'll serve you from the farthest. - Okay, thank you.

461
00:15:16,965 --> 00:15:18,304
Have some first.

462
00:15:18,305 --> 00:15:19,404
No, you go first.

463
00:15:19,405 --> 00:15:22,235
- He wants it more grilled. - I prefer to eat last.

464
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:24,344
- Dong Hyun, it's already... - Is it cooked?

465
00:15:24,345 --> 00:15:25,905
- He doesn't want it. - He wants it more cooked.

466
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:28,145
- She grilled it well for you. - Okay.

467
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:29,275
(Usually, he likes the meat fully cooked.)

468
00:15:29,276 --> 00:15:31,915
I like to eat meat crispy like bacon.

469
00:15:32,615 --> 00:15:34,354
Could you burn some pieces for him?

470
00:15:34,355 --> 00:15:35,355
(He still tries some.)

471
00:15:35,356 --> 00:15:36,555
Please give it to him when it turns black.

472
00:15:38,655 --> 00:15:41,924
Sirloin tastes better when it's slightly undercooked.

473
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:43,555
- This is perfect. - Yes.

474
00:15:43,925 --> 00:15:46,164
It's so good. How is it so delicious?

475
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:47,795
(Let me taste it.)

476
00:15:48,635 --> 00:15:50,565
(Exploding with juice)

477
00:15:51,305 --> 00:15:52,605
It's so good.

478
00:15:52,835 --> 00:15:53,905
How is it possible?

479
00:15:54,675 --> 00:15:56,504
The meat is so juicy...

480
00:15:56,505 --> 00:15:58,245
that I don't have to drink anything.

481
00:15:59,105 --> 00:16:01,675
- It fills the mouth. - It's so good.

482
00:16:04,315 --> 00:16:05,384
It's really delicious.

483
00:16:05,385 --> 00:16:06,985
(The Korean beef melts in the mouth.)

484
00:16:07,115 --> 00:16:08,584
- Thank you. - It's funny how people are.

485
00:16:08,585 --> 00:16:09,814
We didn't have air conditioning,

486
00:16:09,815 --> 00:16:11,455
but now that we're eating in a cool place...

487
00:16:12,055 --> 00:16:13,325
My appetite is back.

488
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:15,795
The marinated crab was good.

489
00:16:16,195 --> 00:16:17,494
- It's better than I thought. - Go ahead.

490
00:16:17,495 --> 00:16:19,164
- Try some. - It's delicious.

491
00:16:19,165 --> 00:16:20,225
The marinated crab...

492
00:16:20,635 --> 00:16:22,135
I usually don't eat this, but...

493
00:16:22,535 --> 00:16:24,605
There are 8 pieces. Have 1.

494
00:16:25,065 --> 00:16:26,465
There should be pieces remaining.

495
00:16:26,665 --> 00:16:27,874
Did someone eat two?

496
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,435
- I had three. - Darn it.

497
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:33,644
No one was eating it.

498
00:16:33,645 --> 00:16:36,515
(Enjoying the raw crab)

499
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,445
(Exclaiming)

500
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:40,915
I'm so happy.

501
00:16:41,885 --> 00:16:44,124
(Delicious Korean beef)

502
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,324
It's really good.

503
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:46,325
(Pleasant air conditioning)

504
00:16:46,326 --> 00:16:47,395
Goodness.

505
00:16:48,325 --> 00:16:50,594
It's nice. They could sell this.

506
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:51,764
- Right? - Yes.

507
00:16:51,765 --> 00:16:53,835
- Is it possible to stay overnight? - Pardon me?

508
00:16:54,165 --> 00:16:55,434
It has great air conditioning.

509
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:56,535
Wouldn't it be delicious...

510
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:58,005
with noodles too?

511
00:16:58,335 --> 00:17:00,734
We don't have to be anxious, right?

512
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:01,834
(An inexplicable feeling of anxiety)

513
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:03,074
It's also on my mind.

514
00:17:03,075 --> 00:17:04,244
- Right? - Yes.

515
00:17:04,245 --> 00:17:05,905
What if he tells us to take out our cards?

516
00:17:06,845 --> 00:17:09,044
It's good to be suspicious.

517
00:17:09,045 --> 00:17:10,785
(Don't worry and feel free to enjoy the food.)

518
00:17:11,745 --> 00:17:14,414
How old is your youngest child?

519
00:17:14,415 --> 00:17:15,415
He's three.

520
00:17:15,815 --> 00:17:18,255
He can talk now.

521
00:17:18,725 --> 00:17:21,795
Does it still feel new even though it's your third child?

522
00:17:21,895 --> 00:17:23,155
(It's needless to say.)

523
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:25,594
Recently, we went on a family trip.

524
00:17:25,595 --> 00:17:28,365
He carried a coconut with him while calling it his friend.

525
00:17:28,735 --> 00:17:30,905
He carried it around even though it was heavy.

526
00:17:31,465 --> 00:17:33,164
I explained to him...

527
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:34,934
at the airport that he can't bring it home with him.

528
00:17:34,935 --> 00:17:36,035
That he has to leave it.

529
00:17:36,205 --> 00:17:37,744
After feeling very sad,

530
00:17:37,745 --> 00:17:39,405
he made a video of it.

531
00:17:40,545 --> 00:17:43,015
He told the coconut, "Take care, my friend."

532
00:17:44,545 --> 00:17:46,984
Coconut, take care of yourself.

533
00:17:46,985 --> 00:17:47,985
(A video filmed by Dan Woo)

534
00:17:47,986 --> 00:17:49,615
My favorite coconut.

535
00:17:50,315 --> 00:17:53,355
My friend, take care of yourself.

536
00:17:54,555 --> 00:17:56,995
That's what he said.

537
00:17:57,125 --> 00:17:58,524
Goodness.

538
00:17:58,525 --> 00:18:00,695
It became the most precious video of my life.

539
00:18:02,195 --> 00:18:04,465
If you like kids, you'll go crazy when you have your own child.

540
00:18:04,565 --> 00:18:06,235
I didn't like children much before.

541
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:08,205
One day, I had love for children.

542
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:11,805
Imagine that your child fell off from a cliff.

543
00:18:12,045 --> 00:18:15,315
It feels like jumping off with him no matter what.

544
00:18:15,615 --> 00:18:18,884
You don't hesitate and think, "I'll die anyway."

545
00:18:18,885 --> 00:18:20,915
You just do it without thinking.

546
00:18:21,285 --> 00:18:22,955
I imagine that a lot.

547
00:18:23,285 --> 00:18:25,685
Instead of imagining such things,

548
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:28,154
- teach your children how to swim. - How to swim?

549
00:18:28,155 --> 00:18:29,724
- Yes. - They're swimming hard.

550
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:31,764
- You must teach them how to swim. - Right.

551
00:18:31,765 --> 00:18:32,895
Knowing how to swim is a must.

552
00:18:34,095 --> 00:18:36,335
- I haven't had grapes in a while. - It feels cold.

553
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:38,504
That's extravagance.

554
00:18:38,505 --> 00:18:39,705
That's the lesson.

555
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:42,805
- That was a great meal. - It was amazing.

556
00:18:43,035 --> 00:18:44,105
It was unbelievable.

557
00:18:45,545 --> 00:18:47,844
(Handsome Guys return to the lodging without any air conditioner.)

558
00:18:47,845 --> 00:18:51,145
This is our first shoot after the show changed.

559
00:18:51,745 --> 00:18:53,915
I discussed with the staff already.

560
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:55,185
Today,

561
00:18:55,955 --> 00:18:57,284
- only Dong Hyun will... - Yes?

562
00:18:57,285 --> 00:18:59,584
- sleep in the heat. - What?

563
00:18:59,585 --> 00:19:01,654
I told them that it would be funny that way.

564
00:19:01,655 --> 00:19:03,095
What do you mean?

565
00:19:03,595 --> 00:19:05,725
It sounds like a masterpiece.

566
00:19:06,165 --> 00:19:07,634
- I don't mind. - Whatever we do...

567
00:19:07,635 --> 00:19:09,794
- You don't mind? - I don't mind.

568
00:19:09,795 --> 00:19:12,434
Whatever we do, Dong Hyun won't get any air conditioning.

569
00:19:12,435 --> 00:19:14,305
It'd be perfect if you sleep next to me.

570
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:17,844
I don't usually sleep with air conditioning.

571
00:19:17,845 --> 00:19:19,375
- Really? - At home even now.

572
00:19:19,445 --> 00:19:20,644
That'd be problematic.

573
00:19:20,645 --> 00:19:21,945
(That'd be problematic.)

574
00:19:22,015 --> 00:19:23,615
Dong Hyun, what temperature do you set it before sleeping?

575
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,114
Me? I set it at 26°C.

576
00:19:25,115 --> 00:19:26,285
Me too.

577
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:27,454
I set it at 23°C.

578
00:19:27,455 --> 00:19:28,584
(Seung Ho gets hot easily.)

579
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:29,885
That's extreme.

580
00:19:30,185 --> 00:19:32,225
I wake up drenched in sweat.

581
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:33,725
I can't sleep.

582
00:19:34,355 --> 00:19:35,494
I take a shower before going to bed.

583
00:19:35,495 --> 00:19:36,894
It's fine as long as I don't move.

584
00:19:36,895 --> 00:19:38,695
I should take a cold shower before going to bed.

585
00:19:40,565 --> 00:19:41,764
(They arrive at the lodging with each of their solution...)

586
00:19:41,765 --> 00:19:42,964
(to prepare for the shortage of air conditioning.)

587
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:44,204
- Thank you. - Thank you.

588
00:19:44,205 --> 00:19:45,935
- Thank you for driving. - Thank you.

589
00:19:46,035 --> 00:19:47,035
Goodness.

590
00:19:47,775 --> 00:19:49,674
Let's go together. What is it?

591
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:51,705
- There's water. - There's a puddle of water.

592
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:54,874
(After stepping in the puddle)

593
00:19:54,875 --> 00:19:56,514
Here's what I think.

594
00:19:56,515 --> 00:19:57,784
(Dong Hyun comes in first to wash himself.)

595
00:19:57,785 --> 00:19:58,885
This is...

596
00:19:58,915 --> 00:20:00,045
What should we do?

597
00:20:01,315 --> 00:20:05,154
(He's about to wash his feet in the bathroom.)

598
00:20:05,155 --> 00:20:06,285
What's this?

599
00:20:06,855 --> 00:20:07,994
What's going on?

600
00:20:07,995 --> 00:20:10,254
(What?)

601
00:20:10,255 --> 00:20:11,965
- What is it? - Something is wrong.

602
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:13,424
- What is it this time? - Tae Hyun.

603
00:20:13,425 --> 00:20:14,435
(Something is wrong?)

604
00:20:15,135 --> 00:20:16,594
- What? - There's no running water.

605
00:20:16,595 --> 00:20:18,605
(There's no running water in the bathroom.)

606
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:20,464
(What do you mean?)

607
00:20:20,465 --> 00:20:21,534
Why isn't there running water?

608
00:20:21,535 --> 00:20:24,375
(What do you mean?)

609
00:20:26,575 --> 00:20:28,214
(There's no running water at the kitchen sink either.)

610
00:20:28,215 --> 00:20:29,315
Goodness.

611
00:20:30,415 --> 00:20:32,884
How can we wash up without water?

612
00:20:32,885 --> 00:20:34,955
I stepped inside a puddle of water.

613
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:36,855
- What? - A puddle of water.

614
00:20:37,325 --> 00:20:39,854
I thought that it'd be hot.

615
00:20:39,855 --> 00:20:42,025
I was worried, but the air conditioner is on.

616
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,895
- My goodness. - Oh, my.

617
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,365
I have to use the toilet too.

618
00:20:48,895 --> 00:20:49,965
What do we do?

619
00:20:50,495 --> 00:20:51,564
I should use drinking water.

620
00:20:51,565 --> 00:20:53,005
Tae Hyun.

621
00:20:53,235 --> 00:20:55,205
I'm sorry, but it can't be helped.

622
00:20:55,535 --> 00:20:58,005
I have to use some drinking water...

623
00:21:01,275 --> 00:21:02,575
We're in trouble.

624
00:21:03,315 --> 00:21:04,485
What is it again?

625
00:21:05,085 --> 00:21:06,584
They took away all the drinking water.

626
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:08,015
(They took away all the drinking water.)

627
00:21:08,585 --> 00:21:09,585
This is ridiculous.

628
00:21:09,586 --> 00:21:11,455
We need drinking water at least.

629
00:21:11,825 --> 00:21:15,325
(He opens the fridge again.)

630
00:21:17,095 --> 00:21:21,465
(They definitely filled up the ice this morning.)

631
00:21:21,535 --> 00:21:23,295
They even took away the ice.

632
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:25,904
(As soon as they arrive)

633
00:21:25,905 --> 00:21:27,235
(No shower, no tap water, no drinking water, no ice)

634
00:21:27,405 --> 00:21:28,804
(Dong Hyun fails to wash his feet.)

635
00:21:28,805 --> 00:21:29,904
My goodness.

636
00:21:29,905 --> 00:21:30,944
(Can we please use the bathroom at least?)

637
00:21:30,945 --> 00:21:31,975
I mean...

638
00:21:32,675 --> 00:21:34,444
We can flush the toilet, right?

639
00:21:34,445 --> 00:21:35,715
(We can flush the toilet, right?)

640
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,061
Tae Hyun.

641
00:21:37,275 --> 00:21:39,144
We can still flush the toilet.

642
00:21:39,145 --> 00:21:40,284
- What? - We can flush the toilet.

643
00:21:40,285 --> 00:21:41,815
The toilet is working?

644
00:21:42,955 --> 00:21:45,954
(Dong Hyun uses the bathroom successfully.)

645
00:21:45,955 --> 00:21:46,876
I mean...

646
00:21:47,085 --> 00:21:48,354
(Dong Hyun's To-Do List: 1. Washing his feet, 2. Using the bathroom)

647
00:21:48,355 --> 00:21:49,755
I can't flush the toilet.

648
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:51,442
Goodness.

649
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:54,434
I take a cold shower at the last moment.

650
00:21:54,435 --> 00:21:55,834
Exactly.

651
00:21:55,835 --> 00:21:57,834
(The three of them arrive late while dreaming of cold showers.)

652
00:21:57,835 --> 00:21:58,835
Gosh, this is...

653
00:22:00,035 --> 00:22:00,846
Why is it so cool in here?

654
00:22:01,805 --> 00:22:03,734
- Dong Hyun, why is it so cool? - What?

655
00:22:03,735 --> 00:22:05,344
- Why does it feel so cool? - Why does it feel cool?

656
00:22:05,345 --> 00:22:06,545
- Come here. - This is nice.

657
00:22:07,045 --> 00:22:08,145
It's nice.

658
00:22:08,215 --> 00:22:08,803
Come here.

659
00:22:09,315 --> 00:22:11,244
Hurry up. We have an emergency.

660
00:22:11,245 --> 00:22:13,044
- What's the matter? - My goodness.

661
00:22:13,045 --> 00:22:14,185
What's wrong?

662
00:22:14,255 --> 00:22:15,284
When we got back,

663
00:22:15,285 --> 00:22:16,684
- it was cool inside. - Okay.

664
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:17,725
And so...

665
00:22:17,785 --> 00:22:19,754
we were surprised by how cool it was.

666
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,854
We were happy.

667
00:22:20,855 --> 00:22:21,924
As I got out of the car,

668
00:22:21,925 --> 00:22:23,255
I stepped into a puddle.

669
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,094
So I went to the bathroom.

670
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,124
(Their faces get twisted as Dong Hyun explains.)

671
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,035
I was about to wash my feet with the shower.

672
00:22:28,395 --> 00:22:29,464
It didn't work.

673
00:22:29,465 --> 00:22:30,934
(Dong Hyun, what are you talking about?)

674
00:22:30,935 --> 00:22:31,785
And so,

675
00:22:32,135 --> 00:22:33,504
I was like, "What's going on?"

676
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:35,434
- Stop lying. - Water doesn't run...

677
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:37,475
- There's no water. - in the sink either.

678
00:22:38,045 --> 00:22:39,644
They turned off the water.

679
00:22:39,645 --> 00:22:40,775
(What?)

680
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:43,075
(Flustered)

681
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:45,085
Is it shortage in water?

682
00:22:45,145 --> 00:22:45,889
Also...

683
00:22:46,545 --> 00:22:47,715
We can use mineral water.

684
00:22:47,885 --> 00:22:50,315
That's exactly what I thought too.

685
00:22:51,355 --> 00:22:53,755
(He opens the fridge gently.)

686
00:22:55,495 --> 00:22:56,495
Hey.

687
00:22:56,496 --> 00:22:57,995
There's no mineral water at all.

688
00:22:58,925 --> 00:23:00,934
- What? - This is ridiculous.

689
00:23:00,935 --> 00:23:05,765
(It feels like they've experienced it before.)

690
00:23:06,035 --> 00:23:08,105
What about going to the bathroom?

691
00:23:08,875 --> 00:23:10,274
Regarding the toilet,

692
00:23:10,275 --> 00:23:12,004
- I wanted to pee. - I want to pee right now.

693
00:23:12,005 --> 00:23:13,044
I said,

694
00:23:13,045 --> 00:23:15,115
"We can flush the toilet."

695
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:17,114
- It didn't work when I tried it. - The water didn't fill up?

696
00:23:17,115 --> 00:23:18,644
It was the water that was already in the tank.

697
00:23:18,645 --> 00:23:20,415
- I lost our one chance. - So I can't pee right now?

698
00:23:21,255 --> 00:23:23,354
There should be water left in the other bathroom.

699
00:23:23,355 --> 00:23:25,254
- Let me pee first. - We should flush...

700
00:23:25,255 --> 00:23:26,884
once everyone has peed.

701
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:28,324
- I won't flush. - Okay.

702
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:29,854
- What's going on here? - Seriously.

703
00:23:29,855 --> 00:23:30,864
It can't be helped.

704
00:23:30,865 --> 00:23:32,224
This is ridiculous.

705
00:23:32,225 --> 00:23:33,294
Don't flush it.

706
00:23:33,295 --> 00:23:35,094
(Yi Kyung is about to use their last chance.)

707
00:23:35,095 --> 00:23:36,434
By the way,

708
00:23:36,435 --> 00:23:38,405
we should be able to pee.

709
00:23:38,765 --> 00:23:39,904
(Yi Kyung is using the bathroom.)

710
00:23:39,905 --> 00:23:41,005
What's wrong?

711
00:23:41,235 --> 00:23:42,575
- There's no water. - What's wrong?

712
00:23:42,605 --> 00:23:43,675
What?

713
00:23:44,145 --> 00:23:45,274
There's no water here.

714
00:23:45,275 --> 00:23:46,304
(The first shortage of air conditioning is over.)

715
00:23:46,305 --> 00:23:49,545
(The second shortage of water starts.)

716
00:23:49,575 --> 00:23:51,544
Water.

717
00:23:51,545 --> 00:23:52,615
Just one?

718
00:23:52,715 --> 00:23:53,885
One should be enough, right?

719
00:23:54,755 --> 00:23:56,784
I really need to use the bathroom.

720
00:23:56,785 --> 00:23:57,854
(Bottled water and the bathroom are essentials of everyday life.)

721
00:23:57,855 --> 00:23:59,554
We need to drink water at least.

722
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:02,155
(An essential of everyday life, water)

723
00:24:04,265 --> 00:24:05,624
There's no running water in the bathroom.

724
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,824
(Shall we try to conserve precious water?)

725
00:24:06,825 --> 00:24:08,095
I mean,

726
00:24:08,465 --> 00:24:09,895
they took away all the drinking water.

727
00:24:10,135 --> 00:24:11,604
(Shortage in water...)

728
00:24:11,605 --> 00:24:14,005
(starts.)

729
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:17,205
What kind of show is this?

730
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:20,205
Is it a show about natural disasters?

731
00:24:22,615 --> 00:24:24,314
I tried turning on the water, but it didn't work.

732
00:24:24,315 --> 00:24:25,345
(There's just a shortage of water.)

733
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:27,815
Isn't there where water drips from the air conditioner?

734
00:24:28,455 --> 00:24:29,755
Can't we collect it?

735
00:24:30,255 --> 00:24:32,024
- That's dangerous to drink. - It's dangerous.

736
00:24:32,025 --> 00:24:33,454
We can wash ourselves with it.

737
00:24:33,455 --> 00:24:35,424
The water in the swimming pool is better than that.

738
00:24:35,425 --> 00:24:36,455
There's water in the swimming pool.

739
00:24:36,555 --> 00:24:37,725
Right.

740
00:24:38,325 --> 00:24:40,164
(He's on the same wavelength.)

741
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:42,365
(Dong Hyun checks water in the swimming pool.)

742
00:24:44,235 --> 00:24:45,935
I think there's still water in the swimming pool.

743
00:24:46,665 --> 00:24:49,174
(Thankfully, there's still water in the swimming pool.)

744
00:24:49,175 --> 00:24:50,974
What are you going to do with the swimming pool water?

745
00:24:50,975 --> 00:24:52,345
We have to take a shower.

746
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:53,705
Aren't you going to wash up?

747
00:24:55,245 --> 00:25:01,455
(They sweated so much today that they need a shower.)

748
00:25:02,015 --> 00:25:03,484
We have to wash our hands at least.

749
00:25:03,485 --> 00:25:04,725
(Devastated)

750
00:25:05,755 --> 00:25:06,985
Something is coming.

751
00:25:07,085 --> 00:25:08,924
- Something is coming. - What is it?

752
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:10,295
Something is coming. Sit down.

753
00:25:10,325 --> 00:25:11,765
They brought some water.

754
00:25:12,525 --> 00:25:14,124
Gosh, it's mineral water.

755
00:25:14,125 --> 00:25:15,195
(The staff arrives with water for those in need.)

756
00:25:15,495 --> 00:25:17,164
As you have expected,

757
00:25:17,165 --> 00:25:18,234
from now on,

758
00:25:18,235 --> 00:25:19,965
there will be a shortage in water.

759
00:25:20,505 --> 00:25:21,934
The shortage of air conditioning is over?

760
00:25:21,935 --> 00:25:23,474
(Yes...)

761
00:25:23,475 --> 00:25:26,105
We turned off all the running water inside the lodging.

762
00:25:26,305 --> 00:25:27,504
My goodness.

763
00:25:27,505 --> 00:25:29,244
Use the water we'll give you...

764
00:25:29,245 --> 00:25:31,015
until 3pm tomorrow.

765
00:25:31,385 --> 00:25:33,485
Water for daily use and drinking water.

766
00:25:35,415 --> 00:25:36,785
Goodness, what?

767
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:39,485
Only this much until 3pm?

768
00:25:40,925 --> 00:25:42,254
What can we do...

769
00:25:42,255 --> 00:25:44,224
with that little water?

770
00:25:44,225 --> 00:25:46,024
- We can wash ourselves. - We can use it for washing.

771
00:25:46,025 --> 00:25:48,364
We probably use three of them when we take a shower.

772
00:25:48,365 --> 00:25:49,464
Right.

773
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:50,664
You sweated...

774
00:25:50,665 --> 00:25:52,864
- a lot all day today. - Yes.

775
00:25:52,865 --> 00:25:54,975
You will now play Line Up the Words.

776
00:25:55,035 --> 00:25:57,204
If you succeed, you'll get a chance to take a shower.

777
00:25:57,205 --> 00:25:58,804
(Once they win, they get to take a shower.)

778
00:25:58,805 --> 00:26:00,175
This is huge.

779
00:26:00,945 --> 00:26:03,015
- Taking a shower is possible. - This is huge.

780
00:26:03,315 --> 00:26:04,844
- This is huge. - Everyone can take a shower?

781
00:26:04,845 --> 00:26:06,515
- This is really huge. - Unbelievable.

782
00:26:06,585 --> 00:26:08,955
You get a total of three tries.

783
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:10,814
If you succeed the first time,

784
00:26:10,815 --> 00:26:12,685
the three of you will get to take a shower.

785
00:26:13,025 --> 00:26:14,655
(Only 3 people?)

786
00:26:14,795 --> 00:26:17,255
Why are you making us fight?

787
00:26:18,325 --> 00:26:20,564
After that, two people.

788
00:26:20,565 --> 00:26:22,434
If you succeed the last time, only one person will get it.

789
00:26:22,435 --> 00:26:23,634
(On the 3rd try, only 1 person can wash up.)

790
00:26:23,635 --> 00:26:25,635
- Not everyone can take a shower? - No.

791
00:26:26,635 --> 00:26:27,735
What?

792
00:26:28,535 --> 00:26:30,375
I didn't take a shower today. I'm in trouble.

793
00:26:30,605 --> 00:26:32,144
If it's Line Up the Words,

794
00:26:32,145 --> 00:26:33,945
- the seating arrangement is key. - Exactly.

795
00:26:34,105 --> 00:26:35,514
Seung Ho should take the most difficult one.

796
00:26:35,515 --> 00:26:36,774
Seung Ho should.

797
00:26:36,775 --> 00:26:38,885
He knows a lot of difficult words.

798
00:26:39,415 --> 00:26:41,014
- Take a seat here. - Should I go second?

799
00:26:41,015 --> 00:26:42,084
You should go third.

800
00:26:42,085 --> 00:26:43,515
- Third? - You know more than me.

801
00:26:43,885 --> 00:26:44,954
How about this?

802
00:26:44,955 --> 00:26:46,624
- Isn't this arrangement good? - How about this?

803
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:47,794
This is good.

804
00:26:47,795 --> 00:26:48,854
- Shall we do a cheer? - In one go.

805
00:26:48,855 --> 00:26:50,054
- Shall we do a cheer? - Let's do a cheer.

806
00:26:50,055 --> 00:26:51,094
- Let's do it. - This is...

807
00:26:51,095 --> 00:26:52,695
the only thing we can do.

808
00:26:53,565 --> 00:26:54,694
- Let's wash up. - Let's wash up.

809
00:26:54,695 --> 00:26:55,835
- Let's go. - Let's go.

810
00:26:55,935 --> 00:26:57,065
Let's do it.

811
00:26:57,865 --> 00:26:58,935
Please.

812
00:26:59,405 --> 00:27:00,605
- Here we go. - Okay.

813
00:27:01,305 --> 00:27:03,335
Song titles that include the word "rain."

814
00:27:04,005 --> 00:27:06,444
Wait, song titles that include the word "rain?"

815
00:27:06,445 --> 00:27:07,914
Is it the title or the context?

816
00:27:07,915 --> 00:27:09,645
- The title. - Song titles with "rain" in them?

817
00:27:09,775 --> 00:27:11,345
- Any type of rain. - Right.

818
00:27:12,045 --> 00:27:13,314
- Start with Sang Uk. - Okay.

819
00:27:13,315 --> 00:27:14,484
One, two, three.

820
00:27:14,485 --> 00:27:15,914
"Shower" by Kim Jang Hoon.

821
00:27:15,915 --> 00:27:17,055
("Shower" by Kim Jang Hoon)

822
00:27:17,355 --> 00:27:18,585
One, two, three.

823
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:20,624
- "Love Rain." - Yes.

824
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:21,795
One, two, three.

825
00:27:21,855 --> 00:27:23,354
"Like Rain, Like Music."

826
00:27:23,355 --> 00:27:24,724
One, two, three.

827
00:27:24,725 --> 00:27:25,795
"Fox Rain."

828
00:27:25,965 --> 00:27:26,965
One, two, three.

829
00:27:26,966 --> 00:27:28,165
"It's Raining" by Jung Chul.

830
00:27:28,295 --> 00:27:29,334
One, two, three.

831
00:27:29,335 --> 00:27:30,365
"In the Rain."

832
00:27:30,535 --> 00:27:31,734
One, two, three.

833
00:27:31,735 --> 00:27:33,135
"Rainy Honam Express?"

834
00:27:33,405 --> 00:27:34,474
Is it correct?

835
00:27:34,475 --> 00:27:35,504
Is it the song title?

836
00:27:35,505 --> 00:27:36,535
Incorrect.

837
00:27:37,775 --> 00:27:41,574
(In despair)

838
00:27:41,575 --> 00:27:43,014
The song is called "Southbound Train."

839
00:27:43,015 --> 00:27:44,244
It's called "Southbound Train."

840
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,445
- Tae Hyun. - Rainy Honam Express

841
00:27:47,285 --> 00:27:48,755
Let me look it up.

842
00:27:49,515 --> 00:27:51,014
- It's "Southbound Train." - Tae Hyun.

843
00:27:51,015 --> 00:27:52,584
I couldn't think of anymore, so I'm relieved.

844
00:27:52,585 --> 00:27:54,224
(I didn't have any, so I'm relieved.)

845
00:27:54,225 --> 00:27:55,324
I couldn't think of anymore.

846
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:56,754
We named a lot.

847
00:27:56,755 --> 00:27:58,425
(I can't wait to take a shower.)

848
00:27:59,195 --> 00:28:00,364
Seriously.

849
00:28:00,365 --> 00:28:01,434
I had nothing on my mind.

850
00:28:01,435 --> 00:28:02,594
There's a song called...

851
00:28:02,595 --> 00:28:03,694
"Rainy Honam Express" by Na Hoon A.

852
00:28:03,695 --> 00:28:04,905
- It exists. - What?

853
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:05,964
Here it is.

854
00:28:05,965 --> 00:28:07,435
("Rainy Honam Express")

855
00:28:07,875 --> 00:28:08,875
This is amazing.

856
00:28:08,876 --> 00:28:10,705
(A miraculous recovery)

857
00:28:11,075 --> 00:28:12,144
By Na Hoon A.

858
00:28:12,145 --> 00:28:13,775
- It exists. - Here it is.

859
00:28:14,645 --> 00:28:16,574
(The original song was by Hyun In in 1948.)

860
00:28:16,575 --> 00:28:18,644
(When Na Hoon A remade it, the song became beloved...)

861
00:28:18,645 --> 00:28:20,685
(by the young and middle-aged generations.)

862
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:22,784
- Okay. We got it. We'll continue. - Correct.

863
00:28:22,785 --> 00:28:23,985
One, two, three.

864
00:28:25,285 --> 00:28:26,385
"Rain."

865
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:28,224
- What? - That's correct.

866
00:28:28,225 --> 00:28:29,324
- It exists. - It exists.

867
00:28:29,325 --> 00:28:31,524
- It exists. - It has to exist.

868
00:28:31,525 --> 00:28:32,565
That works.

869
00:28:32,825 --> 00:28:34,024
One, two, three.

870
00:28:34,025 --> 00:28:35,065
(In that case...)

871
00:28:35,165 --> 00:28:36,235
- "Hail." - Incorrect.

872
00:28:37,135 --> 00:28:38,205
"Hail."

873
00:28:38,505 --> 00:28:39,965
Look up "Hail."

874
00:28:41,305 --> 00:28:43,334
(They're out of luck.)

875
00:28:43,335 --> 00:28:45,245
- Goodness. - Look up "Hail."

876
00:28:45,445 --> 00:28:46,505
I'll look it up for now.

877
00:28:47,145 --> 00:28:48,274
Is there a song called "Hail?"

878
00:28:48,275 --> 00:28:50,345
- I thought that "Rain" would exist. - That exists.

879
00:28:50,515 --> 00:28:51,785
"Rain" by Paul Kim.

880
00:28:51,945 --> 00:28:54,015
- Goodness. - There's a song by Paul Kim.

881
00:28:54,415 --> 00:28:56,284
You should've said something else...

882
00:28:56,285 --> 00:28:57,955
- like "A Shower." - The hail is...

883
00:28:58,355 --> 00:28:59,655
a type of rain.

884
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:01,395
"Hail" exists.

885
00:29:02,295 --> 00:29:03,554
A song called "Hail" exists.

886
00:29:03,555 --> 00:29:04,864
Here it is.

887
00:29:04,865 --> 00:29:06,195
(There's a song called "Hail.")

888
00:29:06,395 --> 00:29:07,725
It's "Hail."

889
00:29:08,365 --> 00:29:10,934
(Does it really exist?)

890
00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:12,435
- It exists. - What?

891
00:29:13,135 --> 00:29:14,604
A song called "Hail" exists.

892
00:29:14,605 --> 00:29:16,134
(Laughing)

893
00:29:16,135 --> 00:29:17,135
"Hail."

894
00:29:17,975 --> 00:29:19,104
- It exists. - What?

895
00:29:19,105 --> 00:29:23,714
(I'll show it to you myself.)

896
00:29:23,715 --> 00:29:24,744
"Hail."

897
00:29:24,745 --> 00:29:27,514
("Hail")

898
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:32,584
("Hail" by Mac Kidd, released in 2012)

899
00:29:32,585 --> 00:29:34,595
(Yes, it's showering, hail)

900
00:29:34,825 --> 00:29:36,855
(The aftereffect is persistent.)

901
00:29:37,025 --> 00:29:38,225
A shout-out to Don Mills.

902
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,425
That's unbelievable.

903
00:29:40,895 --> 00:29:42,494
There are so many songs...

904
00:29:42,495 --> 00:29:43,734
that anything is possible.

905
00:29:43,735 --> 00:29:45,034
It's hailing, hail

906
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,305
We're on a roll.

907
00:29:46,805 --> 00:29:48,205
I'm on a dopamine high right now.

908
00:29:48,975 --> 00:29:52,305
(However, the air is serious among the staff.)

909
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:54,915
We were too easy on you.

910
00:29:55,515 --> 00:29:57,914
But we didn't break any rules.

911
00:29:57,915 --> 00:29:59,114
That's true.

912
00:29:59,115 --> 00:30:00,115
Right.
(You're right, but...)

913
00:30:01,355 --> 00:30:03,655
Then we'll play it one more time.

914
00:30:03,961 --> 00:30:06,100
If we succeed in one go, let all of us take a shower.

915
00:30:06,125 --> 00:30:06,775
Right.

916
00:30:07,126 --> 00:30:09,995
If we succeed this time, everyone gets to take a shower.

917
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:11,165
What if we fail?

918
00:30:12,412 --> 00:30:14,312
Among three people who get to take a shower,

919
00:30:14,565 --> 00:30:17,935
you can exclude one of them.

920
00:30:18,135 --> 00:30:19,964
- So two people if we fail? - Yes.

921
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:21,375
(If they fail, only 2 will take a shower.)

922
00:30:21,535 --> 00:30:22,975
Would you accept our offer?

923
00:30:23,505 --> 00:30:25,804
- We're okay with it. - That sounds good.

924
00:30:25,805 --> 00:30:27,075
We have no reason to refuse.

925
00:30:27,275 --> 00:30:29,274
- Let's go for it. - Our goal is...

926
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:30,614
- everyone taking a shower. - Of course.

927
00:30:30,615 --> 00:30:32,114
It'd be great if all of us can take a shower.

928
00:30:32,115 --> 00:30:33,744
Just take a guess when you don't know.

929
00:30:33,745 --> 00:30:35,084
- It could exist. - Let's take a guess.

930
00:30:35,085 --> 00:30:37,254
- Don't take a ridiculous guess. - Okay.

931
00:30:37,255 --> 00:30:38,785
"Rain" and "Hail" were good guesses.

932
00:30:39,525 --> 00:30:41,424
- Shall we do a cheer? - Of course.

933
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:42,854
We're really on a roll.

934
00:30:42,855 --> 00:30:44,224
How about this? Let us...

935
00:30:44,225 --> 00:30:45,894
- wash up together, let's go. - Wash up together, let's go.

936
00:30:45,895 --> 00:30:47,025
Let's go. We have to take a shower.

937
00:30:47,125 --> 00:30:48,594
All right, here we go.

938
00:30:48,595 --> 00:30:49,694
(Round 2, shower privilege to everyone)

939
00:30:49,695 --> 00:30:51,865
Country names with five syllables.

940
00:30:52,005 --> 00:30:53,465
- Country names? - Goodness.

941
00:30:54,305 --> 00:30:55,635
It became too difficult.

942
00:30:56,075 --> 00:30:57,235
What do I do?

943
00:30:57,775 --> 00:30:59,075
What are some names with five syllables?

944
00:30:59,175 --> 00:31:01,044
- Here we go. - Start with the difficult ones.

945
00:31:01,045 --> 00:31:02,174
One, two, three.

946
00:31:02,175 --> 00:31:03,245
Nigeria.

947
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:04,784
One, two, three.

948
00:31:04,785 --> 00:31:05,845
Indonesia.

949
00:31:06,345 --> 00:31:07,445
One, two, three.

950
00:31:07,545 --> 00:31:08,585
Ukraine.

951
00:31:09,255 --> 00:31:10,285
One, two, three.

952
00:31:10,755 --> 00:31:11,855
Montenegro.

953
00:31:12,585 --> 00:31:14,125
- One, two, three. - Lithuania.

954
00:31:14,485 --> 00:31:15,824
- Lithuania. - One of them is said.

955
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:17,625
(They pass the halfway point instantly.)

956
00:31:17,995 --> 00:31:19,565
(Please)

957
00:31:19,895 --> 00:31:20,895
One, two, three.

958
00:31:20,896 --> 00:31:21,995
Ethiopia.

959
00:31:22,635 --> 00:31:23,665
One, two, three.

960
00:31:25,035 --> 00:31:26,365
Arab Emirates...

961
00:31:26,705 --> 00:31:27,765
Incorrect.

962
00:31:28,175 --> 00:31:29,404
Arab Emirates...

963
00:31:29,405 --> 00:31:31,774
(Everyone taking a shower fails.)

964
00:31:31,775 --> 00:31:32,904
(Thanks to Tae Hyun)

965
00:31:32,905 --> 00:31:34,104
What did you say, Tae Hyun?

966
00:31:34,105 --> 00:31:36,275
Look up "Arab Emirates."

967
00:31:36,745 --> 00:31:38,915
- "Arab Emirates?" - I'll search for it.

968
00:31:39,085 --> 00:31:41,085
- "Arab Emirates." - Tae Hyun, there was Malaysia.

969
00:31:41,855 --> 00:31:42,884
Indonesia.

970
00:31:42,885 --> 00:31:44,554
- Does Slovakia exist? - There's also Slovakia.

971
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:45,984
- There are so many. - Slovakia.

972
00:31:45,985 --> 00:31:47,355
- Slovakia. - There are many more.

973
00:31:47,995 --> 00:31:49,124
This is frustrating.

974
00:31:49,125 --> 00:31:50,294
We should've gone for three people instead.

975
00:31:50,295 --> 00:31:51,564
(The younger members resent the eldest.)

976
00:31:51,565 --> 00:31:53,224
Now that things turned out this way,

977
00:31:53,225 --> 00:31:56,065
let's have one person take a shower.

978
00:31:56,965 --> 00:31:58,504
Everyone if we succeed, one person if we fail?

979
00:31:58,505 --> 00:32:00,264
Either one person takes a shower...

980
00:32:00,265 --> 00:32:02,235
or everyone takes a shower.

981
00:32:02,375 --> 00:32:04,505
This is impossible to stop.

982
00:32:04,975 --> 00:32:07,404
So do you want to play one more time?

983
00:32:07,405 --> 00:32:08,475
- Yes. - Right?

984
00:32:08,845 --> 00:32:10,044
- Either everyone takes a shower, - Right.

985
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:11,114
or one person takes a shower.

986
00:32:11,115 --> 00:32:12,072
Or everyone takes a shower?

987
00:32:12,845 --> 00:32:14,685
- Or one person takes a shower. - Everyone takes a shower?

988
00:32:15,255 --> 00:32:16,585
(Smiling)

989
00:32:16,715 --> 00:32:18,785
- We're asking if it's possible. - Right.

990
00:32:19,025 --> 00:32:20,455
The ball is in their court now.

991
00:32:21,185 --> 00:32:23,455
The ball is in their court now.

992
00:32:23,725 --> 00:32:26,064
We have to exclude at least one person.

993
00:32:26,065 --> 00:32:27,864
- Either four of you wash up... - Okay.

994
00:32:27,865 --> 00:32:29,094
- or one person washes up. - Okay.

995
00:32:29,095 --> 00:32:30,134
Four people are enough.

996
00:32:30,135 --> 00:32:31,765
One person can wash with this water.

997
00:32:31,905 --> 00:32:33,705
That's a good idea. We have this.

998
00:32:34,205 --> 00:32:35,274
Let's do this.

999
00:32:35,275 --> 00:32:37,675
If we fail this time, only one of us can wash up.

1000
00:32:38,205 --> 00:32:40,144
The person who gets it wrong...

1001
00:32:40,145 --> 00:32:41,514
- Okay. - He should exclude himself.

1002
00:32:41,515 --> 00:32:43,115
- Pull yourself aside. - Okay.

1003
00:32:43,315 --> 00:32:44,684
The person who just made a mistake...

1004
00:32:44,685 --> 00:32:46,384
shouldn't take a shower out of conscience.

1005
00:32:46,385 --> 00:32:47,445
I think...

1006
00:32:47,915 --> 00:32:49,455
Listen, Tae Hyun.

1007
00:32:49,555 --> 00:32:52,084
Don't drink this either.

1008
00:32:52,085 --> 00:32:53,785
- Let me have just one sip. - Okay.

1009
00:32:54,085 --> 00:32:55,125
Okay.

1010
00:32:55,295 --> 00:32:56,324
Shall we do another cheer?

1011
00:32:56,325 --> 00:32:57,895
- Let's do it. - We should.

1012
00:32:58,365 --> 00:33:00,094
- Four people, let's wash up. - Let's wash up.

1013
00:33:00,095 --> 00:33:01,764
(They cheer for the third time.)

1014
00:33:01,765 --> 00:33:03,465
- We should do it relaxed. - We need to take a shower.

1015
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,105
We can't be tense.

1016
00:33:05,465 --> 00:33:07,304
Names of male singer duet.

1017
00:33:07,305 --> 00:33:08,374
- Wait a minute. - Hold on.

1018
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:09,804
Names of male singer duet?

1019
00:33:09,805 --> 00:33:11,544
What do you mean exactly by "duet?"

1020
00:33:11,545 --> 00:33:13,905
Names of groups made of two male singers.

1021
00:33:14,605 --> 00:33:16,074
- Without female members? - Right.

1022
00:33:16,075 --> 00:33:17,245
(I'm determined to succeed this time.)

1023
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:18,445
One, two, three.

1024
00:33:18,585 --> 00:33:19,684
Yukgaksu.

1025
00:33:19,685 --> 00:33:21,285
- One, two, three. - Clon.

1026
00:33:21,585 --> 00:33:23,215
- One, two, three. - Green Area.

1027
00:33:23,385 --> 00:33:25,025
- One, two, three. - Yurisangja.

1028
00:33:25,185 --> 00:33:26,555
- One, two, three. - 2Shai.

1029
00:33:27,085 --> 00:33:29,324
(They pass the halfway point smoothly.)

1030
00:33:29,325 --> 00:33:31,055
- One, two, three. - December.

1031
00:33:31,295 --> 00:33:33,124
- One, two, three. - Fly to the Sky.

1032
00:33:33,125 --> 00:33:34,595
- One, two, three. - UN.

1033
00:33:34,995 --> 00:33:36,065
One, two, three.

1034
00:33:36,135 --> 00:33:37,335
(Only Tae Hyun remains.)

1035
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:38,804
One, two, three.

1036
00:33:38,805 --> 00:33:42,505
(Tae Hyun, please succeed this time.)

1037
00:33:43,535 --> 00:33:45,545
(A desperate look in their eyes)

1038
00:33:46,975 --> 00:33:48,045
DEUX.

1039
00:33:49,515 --> 00:33:50,775
- DEUX. - Success.

1040
00:33:50,915 --> 00:33:52,514
(We made it!)

1041
00:33:52,515 --> 00:33:53,914
That's right.

1042
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:55,714
- We made it. - We did it.

1043
00:33:55,715 --> 00:33:57,814
We did it.

1044
00:33:57,815 --> 00:33:59,754
- Goodness. - We made it.

1045
00:33:59,755 --> 00:34:01,624
- We made it. - We finished.

1046
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:03,625
- We made it. - We really did.

1047
00:34:03,855 --> 00:34:06,224
I was hoping that no one would say DEUX.

1048
00:34:06,225 --> 00:34:07,724
- I almost said DEUX. - I know.

1049
00:34:07,725 --> 00:34:09,835
- I couldn't think of any. - I thought, "Anything but DEUX."

1050
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:12,065
Tae Hyun, you were off to a good start.

1051
00:34:12,305 --> 00:34:13,904
No one thought of Yukgaksu.

1052
00:34:13,905 --> 00:34:15,104
Was it you who thought of them?

1053
00:34:15,105 --> 00:34:16,505
- Was it you? - It was Tae Hyun.

1054
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:18,034
Tae Hyun.

1055
00:34:18,035 --> 00:34:19,505
One of us has to wash with this.

1056
00:34:19,775 --> 00:34:21,105
Then let's play one more round.

1057
00:34:21,945 --> 00:34:23,115
For one person?

1058
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:25,184
(That's enough!)

1059
00:34:25,185 --> 00:34:26,884
Then who's going to wash with this?

1060
00:34:26,885 --> 00:34:28,754
Who would use this alone while everyone is taking a shower?

1061
00:34:28,755 --> 00:34:30,885
Shall we play an individual game?

1062
00:34:31,585 --> 00:34:33,385
- An individual game? - To pick one person...

1063
00:34:33,985 --> 00:34:35,424
- The loser washes with that? - With this.

1064
00:34:35,425 --> 00:34:36,855
- Okay. - It's possible to wash with that.

1065
00:34:36,995 --> 00:34:38,324
Anything works.

1066
00:34:38,325 --> 00:34:40,164
One of us has to wash from the water container.

1067
00:34:40,165 --> 00:34:41,964
Okay, that sounds good.

1068
00:34:41,965 --> 00:34:43,195
All right.

1069
00:34:43,823 --> 00:34:44,710
Rock-paper-scissors.

1070
00:34:44,735 --> 00:34:46,665
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1071
00:34:46,948 --> 00:34:48,288
- Okay. - You're last.

1072
00:34:48,405 --> 00:34:49,634
(He's the last one to pick his seat.)

1073
00:34:49,635 --> 00:34:50,734
Rock-paper-scissors.

1074
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:51,775
I get to go first.

1075
00:34:52,905 --> 00:34:53,905
(He's one beat late.)

1076
00:34:53,906 --> 00:34:55,074
Wait a minute.

1077
00:34:55,075 --> 00:34:56,575
- That's not fair. - It is.

1078
00:34:57,181 --> 00:34:58,781
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1079
00:34:58,945 --> 00:35:00,315
Okay, do I get to pick second?

1080
00:35:00,545 --> 00:35:02,885
- I'll sit here. - I'll sit here.

1081
00:35:03,215 --> 00:35:04,354
You have to change seats.

1082
00:35:04,355 --> 00:35:05,784
This is meaningless. Can you move away?

1083
00:35:05,785 --> 00:35:07,224
(Smiling)

1084
00:35:07,225 --> 00:35:08,954
- What about you? - Where are you sitting?

1085
00:35:08,955 --> 00:35:10,054
- I'm sitting here. - Here?

1086
00:35:10,055 --> 00:35:11,525
- You should sit there. - I'm sitting here.

1087
00:35:11,865 --> 00:35:14,025
This seat is the hardest.

1088
00:35:15,935 --> 00:35:16,964
Please.

1089
00:35:16,965 --> 00:35:19,165
(Who will shower from the water container?)

1090
00:35:19,265 --> 00:35:20,265
- Please give us... - It's not a team game.

1091
00:35:20,266 --> 00:35:21,575
a very difficult category.

1092
00:35:22,605 --> 00:35:23,605
No way.

1093
00:35:23,606 --> 00:35:24,734
Why not?

1094
00:35:24,735 --> 00:35:26,004
A difficult category is better.

1095
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:27,445
You won't get to go again.

1096
00:35:28,105 --> 00:35:29,515
A difficult category is better.

1097
00:35:29,775 --> 00:35:31,784
You'll be in trouble if you get to go again.

1098
00:35:31,785 --> 00:35:32,884
Yes, that's true.

1099
00:35:32,885 --> 00:35:34,114
(Individualism wriggling in the face of a water container shower)

1100
00:35:34,115 --> 00:35:35,654
- Here we go. - I need to be relaxed.

1101
00:35:35,655 --> 00:35:36,684
(The loser gets a shower with the water container.)

1102
00:35:36,751 --> 00:35:39,651
Four-syllable names of celebrities who are based in Korea.

1103
00:35:40,355 --> 00:35:42,255
- What? - Four-syllable celebrity names.

1104
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:43,824
This one is very hard.

1105
00:35:43,825 --> 00:35:45,395
Their pseudonyms are also accepted.

1106
00:35:46,068 --> 00:35:48,168
- One, two, three. - Sunwoo Yong Yeo.

1107
00:35:48,765 --> 00:35:50,765
- One, two, three. - Dokgo Young Jae.

1108
00:35:51,095 --> 00:35:52,734
- One, two, three. - Hero Jae Joong.

1109
00:35:52,735 --> 00:35:54,835
Both of them said what I had on my mind.

1110
00:35:55,075 --> 00:35:56,675
- One, two, three. - U-Know.

1111
00:35:57,135 --> 00:35:58,675
- One, two, three. - Hwangwoo Seul Hye.

1112
00:35:59,175 --> 00:36:00,875
- One, two, three. - Sunwoo Jung A.

1113
00:36:01,405 --> 00:36:02,515
One, two, three.

1114
00:36:03,275 --> 00:36:05,284
(Sighing)

1115
00:36:05,285 --> 00:36:06,315
Yes.

1116
00:36:07,045 --> 00:36:09,585
(Screaming with joy)

1117
00:36:10,155 --> 00:36:13,154
Shin Seung Ho got it.

1118
00:36:13,155 --> 00:36:15,024
(Seung Ho gets a shower with the water container.)

1119
00:36:15,025 --> 00:36:16,654
- I mean... - How did it happen?

1120
00:36:16,655 --> 00:36:18,325
I can't believe that Seung Ho lost.

1121
00:36:18,495 --> 00:36:20,194
Do you know why?

1122
00:36:20,195 --> 00:36:22,694
Sunwoo Yong Yeo and Dokgo Young Jae.

1123
00:36:22,695 --> 00:36:24,094
- They're the most famous. - I was going to say them,

1124
00:36:24,095 --> 00:36:26,235
- Right. - but they were said before my turn.

1125
00:36:26,605 --> 00:36:29,634
Suddenly, I thought of Sunwoo Jung A.

1126
00:36:29,635 --> 00:36:30,735
He said Sunwoo Jung A.

1127
00:36:32,005 --> 00:36:34,745
(Seung Ho was stunned.)

1128
00:36:35,175 --> 00:36:38,345
Both Sunwoo Yong Yeo and Dokgo Young Jae are very famous.

1129
00:36:38,985 --> 00:36:40,785
I thought of only two people.

1130
00:36:41,485 --> 00:36:43,354
You rarely lose this game,

1131
00:36:43,355 --> 00:36:45,125
- but you got caught. - Seung Ho rarely loses this one.

1132
00:36:45,925 --> 00:36:48,254
(His eyes lost their focus.)

1133
00:36:48,255 --> 00:36:50,825
Can we sleep in any room?

1134
00:36:50,925 --> 00:36:51,925
Yes.

1135
00:36:51,926 --> 00:36:53,794
It's either this or that room. Tae Hyun, take the other room.

1136
00:36:53,795 --> 00:36:55,634
- By the way... - Both of them are air-conditioned.

1137
00:36:55,635 --> 00:36:57,134
Yes, you can sleep in the next room.

1138
00:36:57,135 --> 00:36:58,335
Do any of you snore?

1139
00:36:58,905 --> 00:37:00,935
I grind my teeth, but I don't snore.

1140
00:37:01,405 --> 00:37:02,675
Dong Hyun, you don't snore, do you?

1141
00:37:02,835 --> 00:37:05,044
It depends on the situation.

1142
00:37:05,045 --> 00:37:06,245
What about today?

1143
00:37:06,645 --> 00:37:08,575
You look quite tired right now.

1144
00:37:09,215 --> 00:37:10,414
Based on the state I'm in now,

1145
00:37:10,415 --> 00:37:12,245
people who sleep next to me tend to complain...

1146
00:37:12,645 --> 00:37:13,844
the next morning.

1147
00:37:13,845 --> 00:37:15,754
Dong Hyun, you can sleep in the bed.

1148
00:37:15,755 --> 00:37:16,785
By myself?

1149
00:37:17,455 --> 00:37:19,254
Tae Hyun can sleep in the corner.

1150
00:37:19,255 --> 00:37:21,154
- Then I'll sleep in the next room. - Okay.

1151
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,425
I'd be happy to.

1152
00:37:23,055 --> 00:37:25,524
If you take a shower 1 by 1, it'll take too long.

1153
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:27,865
We'll turn on the water here temporarily.

1154
00:37:28,225 --> 00:37:30,364
We can take a shower in groups of two.

1155
00:37:30,365 --> 00:37:32,535
Once you turn off the water again, Seung Ho can go.

1156
00:37:32,865 --> 00:37:34,805
Do I also get to go last?

1157
00:37:36,405 --> 00:37:38,004
Do you want to wash up first?

1158
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,074
Go and wash up first.

1159
00:37:39,075 --> 00:37:40,575
- Then they'll turn on the water. - Right.

1160
00:37:40,775 --> 00:37:42,015
- We'll let you go first. - Goodness.

1161
00:37:42,215 --> 00:37:43,375
We'll let you go first.

1162
00:37:43,975 --> 00:37:46,045
- All right. - Will you film us taking a shower?

1163
00:37:46,115 --> 00:37:47,385
How will you wash up?

1164
00:37:48,455 --> 00:37:50,284
I will wash myself completely naked.

1165
00:37:50,285 --> 00:37:52,454
- What kind of question is that? - "How will you wash up?"

1166
00:37:52,455 --> 00:37:54,355
I will wash myself thoroughly.

1167
00:37:56,795 --> 00:37:57,954
Just film him...

1168
00:37:57,955 --> 00:38:00,595
and cover him with a leaf or something.

1169
00:38:00,925 --> 00:38:02,494
With a leaf.

1170
00:38:02,495 --> 00:38:04,095
(Like this?)

1171
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,434
Well done.

1172
00:38:05,435 --> 00:38:07,805
Gosh, I can't believe that Seung Ho lost.

1173
00:38:09,935 --> 00:38:11,405
I'll distribute the water.

1174
00:38:12,175 --> 00:38:13,205
Okay.

1175
00:38:13,445 --> 00:38:16,045
I'll pour 350ml into each bottle.

1176
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:19,514
I'll distribute the remaining water with flexibility.

1177
00:38:19,515 --> 00:38:20,545
Okay.

1178
00:38:21,755 --> 00:38:22,854
I'll go and get washed.

1179
00:38:22,855 --> 00:38:24,515
- Okay. - All right.

1180
00:38:24,715 --> 00:38:26,154
(Miserable)

1181
00:38:26,155 --> 00:38:27,925
It can't be helped because there's a shortage of water.

1182
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:30,694
Gosh.

1183
00:38:30,695 --> 00:38:31,994
(Seung Ho goes to get washed with the water container.)

1184
00:38:31,995 --> 00:38:33,125
Until when...

1185
00:38:33,825 --> 00:38:36,595
(See you later.)

1186
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:38,434
Sang Uk, treasure it.

1187
00:38:38,435 --> 00:38:40,004
- Thank you. - Here you go.

1188
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:42,405
- Are you pouring water for us? - Of course.

1189
00:38:43,535 --> 00:38:45,004
Tae Hyun, treasure it.

1190
00:38:45,005 --> 00:38:46,445
This is life-saving water.

1191
00:38:47,005 --> 00:38:49,415
Looking at it makes me want to take a sip.

1192
00:38:50,675 --> 00:38:53,415
(They each get a bottle of water.)

1193
00:38:54,545 --> 00:38:56,015
Who knew it'd be this comfortable?

1194
00:38:57,455 --> 00:39:00,555
(They enjoy downtime with the AC running.)

1195
00:39:00,885 --> 00:39:04,455
(Meanwhile, Seung Ho comes out after getting a shower first.)

1196
00:39:04,855 --> 00:39:06,665
- I'm all done. - Good.

1197
00:39:07,925 --> 00:39:10,695
(The leftover water is stored safely.)

1198
00:39:11,195 --> 00:39:13,434
(After Seung Ho is done,)

1199
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:16,705
(the water is turned back on for the others.)

1200
00:39:17,305 --> 00:39:20,004
- You two should shower first. - Sure.

1201
00:39:20,005 --> 00:39:21,145
Right now?

1202
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,274
- Go ahead. - Let's go.

1203
00:39:23,275 --> 00:39:24,645
(The two older members go to shower first.)

1204
00:39:24,915 --> 00:39:27,844
(Tae Hyun and Dong Hyun enter the bathroom.)

1205
00:39:27,845 --> 00:39:30,885
(Meanwhile, the younger members)

1206
00:39:31,585 --> 00:39:34,024
- Like this. - Got it.

1207
00:39:34,025 --> 00:39:35,025
(They spread the bedding neatly.)

1208
00:39:35,825 --> 00:39:37,525
Is there shampoo and everything in the bathroom?

1209
00:39:37,725 --> 00:39:38,824
I think I saw them earlier.

1210
00:39:38,825 --> 00:39:39,865
(Yi Kyung and Sang Uk enjoy the benefit of showering.)

1211
00:39:41,025 --> 00:39:43,195
(The water is then turned off.)

1212
00:39:44,095 --> 00:39:46,534
- Cheers. - Good job today.

1213
00:39:46,535 --> 00:39:47,605
Good job, guys.

1214
00:39:48,405 --> 00:39:52,545
(At the end of a hot day, they enjoy a sip of cold beer.)

1215
00:39:53,471 --> 00:39:54,253
Ramyeon...

1216
00:39:55,615 --> 00:39:56,180
Who's in?

1217
00:39:56,645 --> 00:39:58,345
We can't have ramyeon.

1218
00:39:58,885 --> 00:40:00,245
- Why not? - With what water?

1219
00:40:00,445 --> 00:40:01,223
There's water.

1220
00:40:01,645 --> 00:40:02,915
Leftover water from Seung Ho's shower.

1221
00:40:03,115 --> 00:40:04,515
Right there.

1222
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:06,384
- Boiled water is the same. - Let's be frugal.

1223
00:40:06,385 --> 00:40:07,824
That's enough for five bowls of ramyeon.

1224
00:40:07,825 --> 00:40:09,054
Don't be silly.

1225
00:40:09,055 --> 00:40:10,124
(Laughing)

1226
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:12,065
- We could cook more than 5. - Yes, more than 5.

1227
00:40:12,525 --> 00:40:14,224
After having ramyeon,

1228
00:40:14,225 --> 00:40:15,895
- we'll crave water. - Right.

1229
00:40:16,195 --> 00:40:17,634
And there's none to drink.

1230
00:40:17,635 --> 00:40:19,435
- You just have your one bottle. - Have the water you were given.

1231
00:40:19,535 --> 00:40:21,205
We each have a bottle of water.

1232
00:40:21,265 --> 00:40:22,834
What do you say? Should I cook some?

1233
00:40:22,835 --> 00:40:25,444
- How about two or three? - Two or three?

1234
00:40:25,445 --> 00:40:26,745
- Three. - Three?

1235
00:40:26,905 --> 00:40:29,674
- Ramyeon... - I usually don't eat ramyeon,

1236
00:40:29,675 --> 00:40:31,344
- but I do while out camping. - Exactly.

1237
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,014
Also, it's our first time having ramyeon together.

1238
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:35,684
Ramyeon is best enjoyed when camping.

1239
00:40:35,685 --> 00:40:36,915
Should we cook four packets?

1240
00:40:38,315 --> 00:40:39,655
This is a lot.

1241
00:40:40,128 --> 00:40:41,779
- That hasn't been boiled. - Look at that.

1242
00:40:43,055 --> 00:40:44,524
They say you can use water...

1243
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,464
- from watermelon in a pinch. - That's more than enough.

1244
00:40:46,465 --> 00:40:48,534
(Adding the seasoning)

1245
00:40:48,535 --> 00:40:51,195
(In goes the noodles)

1246
00:40:51,935 --> 00:40:55,635
(To that, they add eggs.)

1247
00:40:55,905 --> 00:40:56,974
There.

1248
00:40:56,975 --> 00:40:58,434
(Ramyeon cooked by the two younger members)

1249
00:40:58,435 --> 00:40:59,605
Let's see.

1250
00:40:59,905 --> 00:41:01,274
(Wow!)

1251
00:41:01,275 --> 00:41:03,644
That looks amazing. Are you kidding me?

1252
00:41:03,645 --> 00:41:04,848
You guys are good at this.

1253
00:41:05,285 --> 00:41:06,615
This isn't easy, you know.

1254
00:41:07,385 --> 00:41:08,654
How many eggs did you add?

1255
00:41:08,655 --> 00:41:09,310
Five.

1256
00:41:09,715 --> 00:41:11,655
How can you make ramyeon look like this?

1257
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:14,685
How can I not eat this? Can I have some?

1258
00:41:14,725 --> 00:41:17,055
It looks incredible.

1259
00:41:17,789 --> 00:41:20,859
(They taste it together.)

1260
00:41:20,885 --> 00:41:22,795
I like ramyeon as much as I like beef.

1261
00:41:25,335 --> 00:41:28,805
(A huge mouthful)

1262
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,805
It's good.

1263
00:41:31,535 --> 00:41:32,704
I should've added ten eggs instead.

1264
00:41:32,705 --> 00:41:35,674
(Chubby cheeks)

1265
00:41:35,675 --> 00:41:36,775
It's really good.

1266
00:41:37,315 --> 00:41:38,315
It's even better...

1267
00:41:38,316 --> 00:41:39,945
because this is Seung Ho's leftover water.

1268
00:41:40,385 --> 00:41:41,445
You're right.

1269
00:41:41,745 --> 00:41:43,215
This is amazing.

1270
00:41:45,155 --> 00:41:45,783
It's to die for.

1271
00:41:46,455 --> 00:41:47,785
It's so good.

1272
00:41:48,701 --> 00:41:50,941
Less water and slightly on the salty side.

1273
00:41:51,595 --> 00:41:53,364
(A satisfying late-night snack)

1274
00:41:53,365 --> 00:41:54,695
I'm amazed by this.

1275
00:41:55,065 --> 00:41:57,394
- Sang Uk, have some more. - Gladly.

1276
00:41:57,395 --> 00:41:58,864
(They polish off 5 packets of ramyeon in minutes.)

1277
00:41:58,865 --> 00:42:00,365
It was cooked so well.

1278
00:42:00,648 --> 00:42:02,688
Maybe it's because we're eating this while short on water,

1279
00:42:03,275 --> 00:42:04,574
but I find it precious now.

1280
00:42:04,575 --> 00:42:05,875
This feels so precious to me.

1281
00:42:06,145 --> 00:42:08,444
- I'll be craving water later. - I know.

1282
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:10,415
- Tell me about it. - Exactly.

1283
00:42:10,875 --> 00:42:11,944
Today has been precious for us.

1284
00:42:11,945 --> 00:42:13,045
(Today has been precious for us.)

1285
00:42:14,245 --> 00:42:17,185
(We thought their first retreat was nearly over.)

1286
00:42:17,355 --> 00:42:18,625
We need to get it.

1287
00:42:19,125 --> 00:42:20,455
I can't believe it.

1288
00:42:20,485 --> 00:42:22,136
I'll fill that water bottle...

1289
00:42:22,389 --> 00:42:25,154
with the water from the pool.

1290
00:42:25,155 --> 00:42:27,564
Pour it in after using the toilet.

1291
00:42:27,565 --> 00:42:28,665
- Got it. - Sure.

1292
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:31,494
(Yi Kyung, Seung Ho, and Sang Uk...)

1293
00:42:31,495 --> 00:42:34,805
(go outside at 2am to get water from the pool.)

1294
00:42:35,165 --> 00:42:37,435
(The pool)

1295
00:42:37,735 --> 00:42:40,145
(What!)

1296
00:42:40,705 --> 00:42:42,875
(Something startles the three.)

1297
00:42:43,747 --> 00:42:46,176
(Yi Kyung, Seung Ho, and Sang Uk...)

1298
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:48,577
(go outside at 2am to get water from the pool.)

1299
00:42:49,017 --> 00:42:51,317
(The pool)

1300
00:42:51,447 --> 00:42:54,057
(What!)

1301
00:42:54,487 --> 00:42:57,127
(Something startles the three.)

1302
00:42:57,527 --> 00:42:59,157
- I'll give it a try. - We can walk around it.

1303
00:43:02,597 --> 00:43:03,797
It's back!

1304
00:43:04,627 --> 00:43:05,996
(Are the three fighting against something?)

1305
00:43:05,997 --> 00:43:07,637
Could someone be controlling this?

1306
00:43:08,437 --> 00:43:09,607
Just get back inside.

1307
00:43:10,837 --> 00:43:12,707
We can't. We can't do it.

1308
00:43:15,077 --> 00:43:16,146
We can't do it.

1309
00:43:16,147 --> 00:43:17,507
We can't use the water from the pool.

1310
00:43:17,947 --> 00:43:19,617
- Why not? - Tae Hyun,

1311
00:43:19,777 --> 00:43:22,617
these aren't tiny insects. Drones are flying out there.

1312
00:43:23,747 --> 00:43:26,716
- They're huge. - Can't you still...

1313
00:43:26,717 --> 00:43:27,957
get the water?

1314
00:43:28,187 --> 00:43:31,357
I can't bring myself to collect the water.

1315
00:43:32,457 --> 00:43:35,056
- The bug is this big. - This isn't your average bug.

1316
00:43:35,057 --> 00:43:36,326
(Oh Sang Uk, 192cm)

1317
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:38,467
We can't do without that water.

1318
00:43:39,297 --> 00:43:42,436
Dong Hyun, Tae Hyun, can't you two go out there instead?

1319
00:43:42,437 --> 00:43:44,406
- Why? - Why can't you get the water?

1320
00:43:44,407 --> 00:43:47,106
- The pool water... - There's a huge beetle.

1321
00:43:47,107 --> 00:43:48,236
(Shin Seung Ho, 187cm)

1322
00:43:48,237 --> 00:43:49,406
(The older brothers go out for a 2nd attempt.)

1323
00:43:49,407 --> 00:43:50,447
I mean...

1324
00:43:50,807 --> 00:43:52,477
Why would you be afraid of bugs?

1325
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:57,486
(Tae Hyun boldly walks over to the pool.)

1326
00:43:57,487 --> 00:43:58,987
Are you sure they'll be all right?

1327
00:43:59,917 --> 00:44:01,487
There's no way they can get the water.

1328
00:44:03,327 --> 00:44:04,357
Are they collecting the water?

1329
00:44:04,557 --> 00:44:05,596
(The younger three watch their older brothers.)

1330
00:44:05,597 --> 00:44:07,127
Let's watch them from here.

1331
00:44:08,657 --> 00:44:12,127
(Contrary to what they thought, they're getting water easily.)

1332
00:44:12,837 --> 00:44:13,896
Is this a cockroach?

1333
00:44:13,897 --> 00:44:15,637
(Brave)

1334
00:44:15,807 --> 00:44:17,136
Why were they afraid of this?

1335
00:44:17,137 --> 00:44:18,667
(He's saying he can't understand why they were afraid.)

1336
00:44:18,837 --> 00:44:21,107
No way. They're not fazed by it at all.

1337
00:44:21,877 --> 00:44:22,977
How are they not scared?

1338
00:44:24,307 --> 00:44:25,447
They filled the bottle.

1339
00:44:28,247 --> 00:44:32,317
(They managed to bring the water back.)

1340
00:44:32,817 --> 00:44:35,486
(Applauding their glorious return)

1341
00:44:35,487 --> 00:44:37,057
They got a lot of water.

1342
00:44:38,557 --> 00:44:40,496
- Wasn't there a bug out there? - Where?

1343
00:44:40,497 --> 00:44:42,366
- There was a bug. - It was no big deal.

1344
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,467
(They can comfortably use the toilet now.)

1345
00:44:44,197 --> 00:44:45,496
Good night.

1346
00:44:45,497 --> 00:44:46,996
- Good night, guys. - Good night.

1347
00:44:46,997 --> 00:44:47,997
(It's time to turn in.)

1348
00:44:48,137 --> 00:44:49,236
(From Tae Hyun)

1349
00:44:49,237 --> 00:44:51,237
(Sang Uk, Yi Kyung)

1350
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:56,307
(Even Seung Ho, They're all ready to go to bed.)

1351
00:44:56,847 --> 00:44:59,017
(Good night, Team Handsome.)

1352
00:45:03,487 --> 00:45:06,687
(Current time, 6:30am)

1353
00:45:08,487 --> 00:45:13,257
(Snorer Dong Hyun enjoys sleeping alone in a separate room.)

1354
00:45:13,457 --> 00:45:15,196
(Meanwhile, in the living room)

1355
00:45:15,197 --> 00:45:17,097
(Wriggling)

1356
00:45:20,367 --> 00:45:24,467
(Tae Hyun is the first to wake up.)

1357
00:45:26,894 --> 00:45:31,364
(Why is he already making his bed?)

1358
00:45:34,447 --> 00:45:37,617
(Where is he going?)

1359
00:45:39,057 --> 00:45:42,217
(He sets his bedding out in the hallway.)

1360
00:45:42,327 --> 00:45:44,286
(Cozy)

1361
00:45:44,287 --> 00:45:46,156
(The AC is too cold for Tae Hyun, so he sleeps in the hallway.)

1362
00:45:46,157 --> 00:45:48,457
(Tucked)

1363
00:45:48,627 --> 00:45:50,796
(The temperature is just right for the three in the living room.)

1364
00:45:50,797 --> 00:45:53,697
(Sang Uk, Yi Kyung, Seung Ho)

1365
00:45:53,967 --> 00:45:55,837
(Jumpy)

1366
00:45:56,007 --> 00:45:58,066
(Current time, 7:00am)

1367
00:45:58,067 --> 00:46:00,337
(Yi Kyung wakes up.)

1368
00:46:02,707 --> 00:46:07,577
(He gets on his feet and heads to the kitchen.)

1369
00:46:10,047 --> 00:46:12,557
(Half asleep)

1370
00:46:13,317 --> 00:46:14,717
(Subtly)

1371
00:46:16,427 --> 00:46:20,057
(The staff approaches him in secret.)

1372
00:46:23,267 --> 00:46:24,397
- Yi Kyung. - Yes?

1373
00:46:24,867 --> 00:46:28,097
A wash or water to drink. Choose on three.

1374
00:46:28,597 --> 00:46:29,606
(What?)

1375
00:46:29,607 --> 00:46:31,107
A wash or water to drink.

1376
00:46:32,677 --> 00:46:34,707
(What?)

1377
00:46:35,747 --> 00:46:38,407
(He isn't fully awake yet.)

1378
00:46:38,507 --> 00:46:40,946
A wash or water to drink. One, two, three.

1379
00:46:40,947 --> 00:46:42,747
- Water to drink. - Water to drink.

1380
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,887
(Okay, thanks for answering.)

1381
00:46:48,617 --> 00:46:50,957
(What was that?)

1382
00:46:51,627 --> 00:46:53,927
(Sang Uk and Seung Ho are still in dreamland.)

1383
00:46:54,597 --> 00:46:57,026
(Whatever this is, Sang Uk will choose next.)

1384
00:46:57,027 --> 00:46:58,097
Sang Uk.

1385
00:47:01,837 --> 00:47:04,307
A wash or water to drink. One, two, three.

1386
00:47:04,807 --> 00:47:06,336
- Water to drink. - Water to drink?

1387
00:47:06,337 --> 00:47:07,337
Yes.

1388
00:47:07,338 --> 00:47:08,606
(A wash versus Water to drink)

1389
00:47:08,607 --> 00:47:09,877
(Yi Kyung, Sang Uk: Water to drink)

1390
00:47:10,547 --> 00:47:12,747
(What was that?)

1391
00:47:13,617 --> 00:47:17,017
(He goes back to sleep without bothering to find out.)

1392
00:47:18,047 --> 00:47:20,486
Seung Ho?

1393
00:47:20,487 --> 00:47:21,517
(Seung Ho's next.)

1394
00:47:21,617 --> 00:47:24,187
(He refuses.)

1395
00:47:25,357 --> 00:47:27,126
(2nd attempt)

1396
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:30,826
Seung Ho, a wash or water to drink. One, two, three.

1397
00:47:30,827 --> 00:47:31,966
Again.

1398
00:47:31,967 --> 00:47:34,237
A wash or water to drink. One, two, three.

1399
00:47:34,597 --> 00:47:36,167
- A wash. - A wash.

1400
00:47:36,607 --> 00:47:38,006
(A wash vs Water to drink)

1401
00:47:38,007 --> 00:47:39,337
(Yi Kyung, Sang Uk: Water to drink, Seung Ho: A wash)

1402
00:47:39,737 --> 00:47:43,047
(Next)

1403
00:47:43,847 --> 00:47:45,046
Tae Hyun.

1404
00:47:45,047 --> 00:47:46,347
(Tae Hyun is fast asleep.)

1405
00:47:46,847 --> 00:47:49,447
A wash or water to drink. One, two, three.

1406
00:47:49,747 --> 00:47:51,576
A wash or water to drink?

1407
00:47:51,687 --> 00:47:52,489
- Yes. - What?

1408
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,386
A wash or water to drink?

1409
00:47:55,387 --> 00:47:56,392
What is that?

1410
00:47:56,627 --> 00:47:58,387
Choose one or the other.

1411
00:47:58,457 --> 00:48:00,096
Oh, I'll choose water to drink.

1412
00:48:00,097 --> 00:48:01,157
Water to drink.

1413
00:48:01,227 --> 00:48:02,666
Okay, got it.

1414
00:48:02,667 --> 00:48:03,967
(A wash versus water to drink, Only Seung Ho chose a wash.)

1415
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:07,037
(Lastly, Dong Hyun)

1416
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,267
Dong Hyun.

1417
00:48:09,967 --> 00:48:11,406
A wash or water to drink?

1418
00:48:11,407 --> 00:48:12,577
One, two, three.

1419
00:48:13,007 --> 00:48:14,237
Water... What?

1420
00:48:14,407 --> 00:48:15,776
A wash or water to drink?

1421
00:48:15,777 --> 00:48:17,206
What... A wash.

1422
00:48:17,207 --> 00:48:19,007
A wash? Okay.

1423
00:48:19,817 --> 00:48:22,317
(What is this?)

1424
00:48:22,787 --> 00:48:27,087
(Seung Ho and Dong Hyun chose a wash.)

1425
00:48:27,117 --> 00:48:32,827
(The mysterious Q-and-A session is over.)

1426
00:48:33,257 --> 00:48:38,997
(Tribe Handsome is back to their deep slumber.)

1427
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:45,937
(Yi Kyung is the only one who is wide awake.)

1428
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:51,477
(Looking around)

1429
00:48:54,677 --> 00:48:58,987
(Yi Kyung starts walking as he looks around.)

1430
00:48:59,317 --> 00:49:02,087
(He quietly checks behind the TV.)

1431
00:49:02,557 --> 00:49:04,487
(He goes straightforward while holding his breath.)

1432
00:49:05,827 --> 00:49:08,997
(Yi Kyung takes something out from behind the TV.)

1433
00:49:09,497 --> 00:49:11,397
(Seung Ho)

1434
00:49:12,297 --> 00:49:15,097
(He grabs Seung Ho's bottled water.)

1435
00:49:17,407 --> 00:49:20,337
(He tries to hide it above the curtain rod.)

1436
00:49:20,537 --> 00:49:22,207
(Gosh)

1437
00:49:23,647 --> 00:49:26,317
(He didn't wake up.)

1438
00:49:26,647 --> 00:49:29,247
(He tries to hide it again.)

1439
00:49:32,517 --> 00:49:34,287
(Frozen)

1440
00:49:34,357 --> 00:49:36,487
(What are you doing?)

1441
00:49:37,227 --> 00:49:38,956
(Interpretation: sunscreen)

1442
00:49:38,957 --> 00:49:41,357
(I was putting on sunscreen.)

1443
00:49:41,657 --> 00:49:44,497
(He doesn't care.)

1444
00:49:45,967 --> 00:49:48,637
(Yi Kyung hid Seung Ho's water.)

1445
00:49:49,097 --> 00:49:51,567
(His own water)

1446
00:49:53,607 --> 00:49:57,506
(He hides his own water in the cold refrigerator.)

1447
00:49:57,507 --> 00:49:59,947
(The next target is...)

1448
00:50:00,147 --> 00:50:02,517
(Sang Uk's water.)

1449
00:50:04,587 --> 00:50:07,157
(Sang Uk's water goes above the air conditioner.)

1450
00:50:07,257 --> 00:50:10,127
(Tae Hyun)

1451
00:50:10,287 --> 00:50:12,456
(He tries to hide Tae Hyun's water as well.)

1452
00:50:12,457 --> 00:50:14,257
(Looking around furtively)

1453
00:50:16,367 --> 00:50:20,136
(He successfully hides it above the highest curtain rod.)

1454
00:50:20,137 --> 00:50:23,407
(The empty water bottle after sharing water yesterday)

1455
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,737
(Writing something)

1456
00:50:26,677 --> 00:50:27,736
(Sang Uk)

1457
00:50:27,737 --> 00:50:30,707
(He even sets up a fake water bottle for the perfect crime.)

1458
00:50:32,877 --> 00:50:35,447
(He removes the label from an empty coke bottle...)

1459
00:50:35,577 --> 00:50:38,717
(and fakes it to look like Tae Hyun's water bottle.)

1460
00:50:39,517 --> 00:50:42,627
(The mulberry bottle becomes Seung Ho's water bottle.)

1461
00:50:42,657 --> 00:50:46,527
(He's fully prepared for the perfect crime.)

1462
00:50:46,897 --> 00:50:48,257
Sang Uk.

1463
00:50:48,657 --> 00:50:50,027
Seung Ho.

1464
00:50:51,497 --> 00:50:52,836
You have to get up now.

1465
00:50:52,837 --> 00:50:53,937
(Yi Kyung wakes the younger guys as if nothing happened.)

1466
00:50:54,737 --> 00:50:56,006
Get up.

1467
00:50:56,007 --> 00:50:57,507
- Good morning. - Hey.

1468
00:50:58,937 --> 00:51:00,377
Oh, gosh.

1469
00:51:01,207 --> 00:51:02,407
The water I had left over yesterday.

1470
00:51:03,507 --> 00:51:04,847
Where did my water go?

1471
00:51:06,347 --> 00:51:07,647
Get up.

1472
00:51:08,147 --> 00:51:10,117
- My water. - Your name is on that one.

1473
00:51:10,987 --> 00:51:12,047
This isn't it.

1474
00:51:14,417 --> 00:51:15,587
What is this?

1475
00:51:15,957 --> 00:51:17,387
Get up.

1476
00:51:20,097 --> 00:51:21,396
I didn't drink water...

1477
00:51:21,397 --> 00:51:22,596
I didn't get to drink it.

1478
00:51:22,597 --> 00:51:24,227
(Still half asleep)

1479
00:51:24,897 --> 00:51:26,997
Gosh, what is this now?

1480
00:51:27,997 --> 00:51:29,667
There must be something else going on.

1481
00:51:29,807 --> 00:51:32,837
(Tae Hyun suspects the staff.)

1482
00:51:33,407 --> 00:51:34,936
You have to get up now.

1483
00:51:34,937 --> 00:51:38,777
(The culprit wakes the members as if nothing was wrong.)

1484
00:51:44,147 --> 00:51:45,217
What is this?

1485
00:51:46,887 --> 00:51:48,956
The water is a weird color.

1486
00:51:48,957 --> 00:51:50,327
(The water is a weird color.)

1487
00:51:50,487 --> 00:51:54,097
(Dong Hyun's water has changed color to look nothing like water.)

1488
00:51:54,797 --> 00:51:56,267
We don't have water.

1489
00:51:57,167 --> 00:51:58,297
Yours is here.

1490
00:52:00,597 --> 00:52:02,936
(They each start noticing the state of their water.)

1491
00:52:02,937 --> 00:52:04,267
Seung Ho's is the funniest.

1492
00:52:05,007 --> 00:52:06,277
Give me water!

1493
00:52:07,237 --> 00:52:08,807
I said, give me water!

1494
00:52:09,377 --> 00:52:12,177
(Rascal Seung Ho is really mad.)

1495
00:52:12,377 --> 00:52:13,777
Give me my water.

1496
00:52:13,947 --> 00:52:15,246
(The chaotic morning begins with Yi Kyung's brilliant move.)

1497
00:52:15,247 --> 00:52:16,287
What's up with this color?

1498
00:52:16,547 --> 00:52:17,686
Is it cement?

1499
00:52:17,687 --> 00:52:19,817
(The chaotic morning begins with Yi Kyung's brilliant move.)

1500
00:52:20,217 --> 00:52:21,817
- What's going on? - Mine is gone.

1501
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,186
- What about you? - Mine is empty.

1502
00:52:23,187 --> 00:52:24,687
- Oh, just the bottle? - Yes.

1503
00:52:25,257 --> 00:52:26,796
Why am I the only one with something inside?

1504
00:52:26,797 --> 00:52:29,097
I know. Why do you have something inside?

1505
00:52:29,257 --> 00:52:30,696
There must be something weird just for you.

1506
00:52:30,697 --> 00:52:31,997
(Sniffing)

1507
00:52:32,297 --> 00:52:33,367
It...

1508
00:52:33,997 --> 00:52:35,397
smells like soy milk.

1509
00:52:36,167 --> 00:52:37,306
- I see. - Beans?

1510
00:52:37,307 --> 00:52:39,107
- Why am I the only one with this? - Try it.

1511
00:52:39,307 --> 00:52:40,736
Maybe it's for your muscles.

1512
00:52:40,737 --> 00:52:41,907
- I... - Why?

1513
00:52:42,607 --> 00:52:45,747
(Last night)

1514
00:52:45,907 --> 00:52:48,847
(When Dong Hyun goes inside to go to bed first...)

1515
00:52:50,147 --> 00:52:51,147
Seung Ho, give me your bottle too.

1516
00:52:51,148 --> 00:52:52,547
You already had some, didn't you?

1517
00:52:52,817 --> 00:52:54,216
(The group sleeping in the living room...)

1518
00:52:54,217 --> 00:52:56,626
(stole Dong Hyun's water that he left in the living room.)

1519
00:52:56,627 --> 00:52:59,457
(On top of that...)

1520
00:52:59,757 --> 00:53:01,956
- Wouldn't he like this too? - Is that a protein drink?

1521
00:53:01,957 --> 00:53:02,996
Yes, it is.

1522
00:53:02,997 --> 00:53:04,867
(High in protein)

1523
00:53:04,927 --> 00:53:06,266
He's always going on about protein.

1524
00:53:06,267 --> 00:53:07,896
- I'm sure he'll like this. - This is so funny.

1525
00:53:07,897 --> 00:53:09,937
- Well, this should be... - I'm sure he'll like it.

1526
00:53:10,407 --> 00:53:11,607
Is this okay to drink?

1527
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:13,907
- Who knows? - We didn't have any.

1528
00:53:15,137 --> 00:53:17,006
(Hesitant)

1529
00:53:17,007 --> 00:53:19,247
(Holding in their laughter)

1530
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:21,276
I'm scared.

1531
00:53:21,277 --> 00:53:22,847
(Laughing)

1532
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:24,186
I'm scared.

1533
00:53:24,187 --> 00:53:25,546
- Is that like... - Why are you scared?

1534
00:53:25,547 --> 00:53:27,457
I'm sure it's nothing deadly.

1535
00:53:28,357 --> 00:53:29,457
(Scaring him, Startled)

1536
00:53:29,657 --> 00:53:31,987
(Laughing)

1537
00:53:32,187 --> 00:53:33,457
Hey, this tastes good.

1538
00:53:34,057 --> 00:53:35,526
- What is it? - The stuff you like.

1539
00:53:35,527 --> 00:53:36,597
- You know? - It's sweet.

1540
00:53:37,027 --> 00:53:38,127
What is it?

1541
00:53:38,367 --> 00:53:39,397
Do you want some?

1542
00:53:39,867 --> 00:53:40,997
Did you sleep well?

1543
00:53:41,367 --> 00:53:42,396
Oh, it's water.

1544
00:53:42,397 --> 00:53:43,467
I mean...

1545
00:53:43,667 --> 00:53:45,266
Why did you take away what we already had?

1546
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:46,476
I know. Why would you take...

1547
00:53:46,477 --> 00:53:48,076
- What did you put in... - What you already had?

1548
00:53:48,077 --> 00:53:49,607
- Dong Hyun's water? - I know.

1549
00:53:49,677 --> 00:53:51,106
We didn't take your drinking water.

1550
00:53:51,107 --> 00:53:52,276
We don't have any drinking water.

1551
00:53:52,277 --> 00:53:54,447
Oh, then you took my water.

1552
00:53:54,917 --> 00:53:56,987
I knew it ever since he was walking around this morning.

1553
00:53:57,447 --> 00:53:59,016
I know you're going to suspect me,

1554
00:53:59,017 --> 00:54:00,157
but mine is gone too.

1555
00:54:00,387 --> 00:54:01,887
Who put them away? Why?

1556
00:54:02,157 --> 00:54:04,757
Gosh, why in the world are you doing this?

1557
00:54:06,527 --> 00:54:07,596
(He remembers something.)

1558
00:54:07,597 --> 00:54:09,397
Did someone take mine...

1559
00:54:09,527 --> 00:54:10,626
and make me mad?

1560
00:54:10,627 --> 00:54:12,496
- What... - What on earth would you do this?

1561
00:54:12,497 --> 00:54:14,666
Who woke up early this morning? It was you.

1562
00:54:14,667 --> 00:54:17,207
(This angle seems familiar.)

1563
00:54:17,307 --> 00:54:18,966
(Seung Ho saw it clearly even in his sleep.)

1564
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:20,736
- Gosh, seriously. This is crazy. - What is that?

1565
00:54:20,737 --> 00:54:22,236
- It was Seung Ho. - It's mine.

1566
00:54:22,237 --> 00:54:23,647
(Laughing)

1567
00:54:23,707 --> 00:54:24,776
It was Seung Ho.

1568
00:54:24,777 --> 00:54:26,517
(Pretending to be innocent)

1569
00:54:26,677 --> 00:54:27,947
Oh, there's one here too.

1570
00:54:28,317 --> 00:54:29,786
Did you hide them somewhere?

1571
00:54:29,787 --> 00:54:30,916
Is that mine?

1572
00:54:30,917 --> 00:54:31,917
Oh, it says Sang Uk.

1573
00:54:31,918 --> 00:54:33,357
- Oh, nice. - What about mine?

1574
00:54:33,387 --> 00:54:34,516
Where did they put mine?

1575
00:54:34,517 --> 00:54:36,586
Why did they hide mine in such a difficult spot?

1576
00:54:36,587 --> 00:54:37,727
(They only care about their own water bottles.)

1577
00:54:37,987 --> 00:54:39,727
Gosh, no one could find that.

1578
00:54:39,797 --> 00:54:42,256
(He finds it.)

1579
00:54:42,257 --> 00:54:43,696
I mean, no one can take that out.

1580
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:44,796
It's over here.

1581
00:54:44,797 --> 00:54:45,826
This guy did it.

1582
00:54:45,827 --> 00:54:46,896
- This... - No, it was him.

1583
00:54:46,897 --> 00:54:48,036
No one else could do this but you.

1584
00:54:48,037 --> 00:54:49,066
- Hey! - No, seriously.

1585
00:54:49,067 --> 00:54:51,107
- Who else besides you could... - No.

1586
00:54:51,307 --> 00:54:52,807
Hey, you can barely reach it too.

1587
00:54:53,007 --> 00:54:54,107
Darn it.

1588
00:54:54,777 --> 00:54:56,377
- Darn it. - Hey, give me mine too.

1589
00:54:56,477 --> 00:54:58,076
Seriously, it wasn't me.

1590
00:54:58,077 --> 00:54:59,446
- For real. - Who else would do this, then?

1591
00:54:59,447 --> 00:55:00,916
Who could put that up there?

1592
00:55:00,917 --> 00:55:01,976
It really wasn't me.

1593
00:55:01,977 --> 00:55:03,247
It seems like me because it's high up.

1594
00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:04,847
It really wasn't me.

1595
00:55:04,848 --> 00:55:06,187
"It seems like me because it's high up."

1596
00:55:06,257 --> 00:55:07,717
Do I sleepwalk?

1597
00:55:07,857 --> 00:55:08,916
What is mine, then?

1598
00:55:08,917 --> 00:55:10,556
(Perplexed)

1599
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,526
Seriously, though. What is that?

1600
00:55:12,527 --> 00:55:14,296
- His is unbelievable. - I don't know what happened.

1601
00:55:14,297 --> 00:55:15,496
- Dong Hyun's is... - Darn it.

1602
00:55:15,497 --> 00:55:16,527
(Dong Hyun didn't realize it until the end.)

1603
00:55:16,597 --> 00:55:18,266
Before you woke up this morning,

1604
00:55:18,267 --> 00:55:20,296
- we asked you each a question. - Yes.

1605
00:55:20,297 --> 00:55:21,696
A wash or water to drink.

1606
00:55:21,697 --> 00:55:23,306
- You had to choose 1 of the 2. - Yes.

1607
00:55:23,307 --> 00:55:25,367
- Yi Kyung chose water to drink. - Water to drink.

1608
00:55:25,467 --> 00:55:27,637
- Sang Uk chose water to drink. - Water to drink. That's right.

1609
00:55:27,737 --> 00:55:29,136
- Tae Hyun chose water to drink. - Water to drink.

1610
00:55:29,137 --> 00:55:30,847
Right. You should've chosen water.

1611
00:55:31,677 --> 00:55:32,847
Dong Hyun.

1612
00:55:32,977 --> 00:55:34,517
I think I said a wash.

1613
00:55:35,317 --> 00:55:36,587
- A wash. - Yes.

1614
00:55:36,687 --> 00:55:39,146
- Seung Ho chose a wash. - A wash.

1615
00:55:39,147 --> 00:55:40,716
We must've had to choose the same one.

1616
00:55:40,717 --> 00:55:41,957
What is it? Three versus two?

1617
00:55:42,187 --> 00:55:43,857
- We played the telepathy game. - Yes.

1618
00:55:44,087 --> 00:55:45,256
We blew it.

1619
00:55:45,257 --> 00:55:48,397
- If you all chose the same thing, - I told you.

1620
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:50,927
we were going to provide you with an endless supply of water...

1621
00:55:51,267 --> 00:55:52,466
for washing or drinking.

1622
00:55:52,467 --> 00:55:53,567
- Endless? My gosh. - My gosh.

1623
00:55:53,637 --> 00:55:54,666
An endless supply?

1624
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:55,966
Obviously, you can wash with drinking water.

1625
00:55:55,967 --> 00:55:56,967
Then, the night before, you could've...

1626
00:55:56,968 --> 00:55:58,536
Oh, you can't tell us, can you?

1627
00:55:58,537 --> 00:56:00,037
If you told us the night before, we would've planned it.

1628
00:56:00,407 --> 00:56:01,737
That's right.

1629
00:56:02,407 --> 00:56:04,206
Since you didn't answer with the same thing,

1630
00:56:04,207 --> 00:56:05,877
you've failed to obtain water.

1631
00:56:06,277 --> 00:56:07,317
I mean...

1632
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:08,847
When we get up in the morning,

1633
00:56:09,047 --> 00:56:11,186
shouldn't you at least let us pee?

1634
00:56:11,187 --> 00:56:12,316
(Demanding to take care of urgent bodily functions)

1635
00:56:12,317 --> 00:56:13,816
- You can pee, Tae Hyun. - What?

1636
00:56:13,817 --> 00:56:14,817
You can pee.

1637
00:56:14,818 --> 00:56:15,916
You just can't flush.

1638
00:56:15,917 --> 00:56:16,987
Darn it.

1639
00:56:17,557 --> 00:56:19,756
If it's going to be like this, I'll pee in that plastic bottle...

1640
00:56:19,757 --> 00:56:21,356
and leave it in the living room. Seriously, this is so annoying.

1641
00:56:21,357 --> 00:56:22,557
So,

1642
00:56:23,097 --> 00:56:25,766
we're going to give you another chance to get some water.

1643
00:56:25,767 --> 00:56:26,896
Here's the second round...

1644
00:56:26,897 --> 00:56:28,997
of the telepathy game.

1645
00:56:29,137 --> 00:56:31,837
These are the ingredients that you bought yesterday.

1646
00:56:31,967 --> 00:56:33,106
Choose one,

1647
00:56:33,107 --> 00:56:36,036
and if all of you write down a different item, you succeed.

1648
00:56:36,037 --> 00:56:37,906
You may not discuss with each other or give each other hints.

1649
00:56:37,907 --> 00:56:40,217
- We have to write different items? - Yes.

1650
00:56:40,317 --> 00:56:41,817
If you succeed in the mission,

1651
00:56:41,917 --> 00:56:44,017
you will get one of each.

1652
00:56:44,847 --> 00:56:45,986
(Exasperated)

1653
00:56:45,987 --> 00:56:47,016
How can we...

1654
00:56:47,017 --> 00:56:48,917
We should each write down what suits our own image.

1655
00:56:49,587 --> 00:56:51,356
Then, I'll do that one.

1656
00:56:51,357 --> 00:56:52,926
The one I like the most.

1657
00:56:52,927 --> 00:56:54,497
You can't discuss it from now on.

1658
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,827
Well, I was just talking to myself.

1659
00:56:55,957 --> 00:56:58,166
- Don't talk to yourself. - I really like that one.

1660
00:56:58,167 --> 00:57:00,136
- Put your hand on your conscience. - The one you like...

1661
00:57:00,137 --> 00:57:02,167
We should each write down what we like.

1662
00:57:02,397 --> 00:57:05,207
(Trying to read each other's faces)

1663
00:57:05,407 --> 00:57:07,606
(Writing)

1664
00:57:07,607 --> 00:57:09,076
What is it? What are you writing?

1665
00:57:09,077 --> 00:57:10,247
Why is it so long?

1666
00:57:11,577 --> 00:57:15,947
(Please work, telepathy.)

1667
00:57:16,847 --> 00:57:19,147
(Sang Uk finishes writing as well.)

1668
00:57:19,447 --> 00:57:20,656
All right, then.

1669
00:57:20,657 --> 00:57:21,916
We'll see Sang Uk's answer first.

1670
00:57:21,917 --> 00:57:22,917
(We'll see Sang Uk's answer first.)

1671
00:57:23,257 --> 00:57:24,726
(Danba X, Jjajang ramyeon)

1672
00:57:24,727 --> 00:57:26,527
- Jjajang ramyeon? - Jjajang ramyeon.

1673
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:27,697
Jjajang ramyeon.

1674
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:29,157
What's Danba?

1675
00:57:29,967 --> 00:57:31,766
I nearly wrote protein bar.

1676
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:33,067
(I nearly wrote protein bar.)

1677
00:57:33,237 --> 00:57:34,266
Then, Yi Kyung.

1678
00:57:34,267 --> 00:57:35,536
I'm sure I'm the only one who'd write this.

1679
00:57:35,537 --> 00:57:37,336
Out of the five of us...

1680
00:57:37,337 --> 00:57:38,406
Mulberry.

1681
00:57:38,407 --> 00:57:39,407
(Mulberry)

1682
00:57:39,807 --> 00:57:41,736
I like liquor the most.

1683
00:57:41,737 --> 00:57:42,906
At this hour of the morning?

1684
00:57:42,907 --> 00:57:45,076
- Mulberry. - Yes, I'm the only one.

1685
00:57:45,077 --> 00:57:46,106
Okay, then.

1686
00:57:46,107 --> 00:57:47,247
(It's Dong Hyun's turn.)

1687
00:57:47,377 --> 00:57:48,416
Sweet potato.

1688
00:57:48,417 --> 00:57:50,017
(Sweet potato)

1689
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:51,987
You should've chosen the protein bar.

1690
00:57:52,417 --> 00:57:54,917
But I chose the sweet potato yesterday.

1691
00:57:55,157 --> 00:57:56,759
Me too. I chose the one I bought yesterday too.

1692
00:57:57,657 --> 00:57:59,327
- Instant rice. - Oh, then we got it!

1693
00:57:59,957 --> 00:58:02,557
(Our answers didn't overlap!)

1694
00:58:02,797 --> 00:58:04,166
(Their telepathy worked well so far.)

1695
00:58:04,167 --> 00:58:06,167
(Sang Uk, Tae Hyun, Dong Hyun, Yi Kyung)

1696
00:58:06,537 --> 00:58:08,937
(Only Seung Ho remains.)

1697
00:58:09,567 --> 00:58:10,937
(What will it be?)

1698
00:58:14,507 --> 00:58:17,177
(Jjajang ramyeon)

1699
00:58:17,277 --> 00:58:19,476
- This is what I love the most. - You two.

1700
00:58:19,477 --> 00:58:22,276
- There's the Cheongyang chili... - I like this the most.

1701
00:58:22,277 --> 00:58:23,787
I was writing loudly on purpose.

1702
00:58:24,217 --> 00:58:26,187
You picked the cucumber chili too.

1703
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:27,757
I did.

1704
00:58:29,687 --> 00:58:31,526
- Anyone could see Seung Ho... - Right.

1705
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:32,857
- wanted the ramyeon. I knew it. - Me too.

1706
00:58:33,897 --> 00:58:36,056
- Oh, really? - I expected everything.

1707
00:58:36,057 --> 00:58:38,567
- Please give us the next question. - You've failed.

1708
00:58:39,167 --> 00:58:41,597
You have one last chance for the telepathy game.

1709
00:58:41,797 --> 00:58:44,936
From now on, you have to write the name of a guest...

1710
00:58:44,937 --> 00:58:47,077
who appeared on Handsome Guys.

1711
00:58:47,137 --> 00:58:48,836
Gosh, if I write something hard...

1712
00:58:48,837 --> 00:58:51,046
Was there someone who I had a connection to?

1713
00:58:51,047 --> 00:58:52,247
No, don't say it out loud.

1714
00:58:52,747 --> 00:58:53,917
He's talking to himself.

1715
00:58:54,347 --> 00:58:56,646
- Gosh, this is... - We have to think about this.

1716
00:58:56,647 --> 00:58:57,987
This is risky.

1717
00:58:58,517 --> 00:58:59,646
Gosh, this is so...

1718
00:58:59,647 --> 00:59:00,917
(This is quite risky.)

1719
00:59:01,187 --> 00:59:02,456
Gosh, this is so hard.

1720
00:59:02,457 --> 00:59:04,387
(Sang Uk feels the most pressure as he feels so guilty.)

1721
00:59:04,657 --> 00:59:06,256
All right. I've made up my mind. No one will choose this person.

1722
00:59:06,257 --> 00:59:07,997
(Meanwhile, Yi Kyung writes down a name with no hesitation.)

1723
00:59:08,557 --> 00:59:10,497
- I have a feeling. - I wrote mine right away.

1724
00:59:10,667 --> 00:59:12,126
(Writing without hesitation)

1725
00:59:12,127 --> 00:59:13,697
This is good. I have a feeling.

1726
00:59:15,197 --> 00:59:20,637
(Tae Hyun and Dong Hyun start writing too.)

1727
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,037
Gosh, I think everyone would have written this name.

1728
00:59:24,647 --> 00:59:26,546
This is risky. It's pretty risky this time.

1729
00:59:26,547 --> 00:59:28,417
Then, I'll write mine within 0.5 seconds.

1730
00:59:28,617 --> 00:59:31,017
- Then, shall we just... - Okay.

1731
00:59:31,517 --> 00:59:33,517
Does anyone want to reveal their answer first?

1732
00:59:34,017 --> 00:59:35,816
- I'll go first. - Okay.

1733
00:59:35,817 --> 00:59:37,057
(First batter up, Sang Uk)

1734
00:59:38,027 --> 00:59:39,627
Gosh, I thought about him until the end.

1735
00:59:40,057 --> 00:59:41,727
(Thank goodness)

1736
00:59:41,857 --> 00:59:43,867
Hey, how can you write Jin's name?

1737
00:59:44,227 --> 00:59:45,296
- Why? - Why?

1738
00:59:45,297 --> 00:59:46,537
Then, who would I write?

1739
00:59:47,267 --> 00:59:48,667
- You should've written his name. - I should've.

1740
00:59:48,937 --> 00:59:50,766
He's going to be that risky?

1741
00:59:50,767 --> 00:59:51,767
I know.

1742
00:59:52,237 --> 00:59:55,307
I thought no one would've written this name earlier too.

1743
00:59:55,707 --> 00:59:57,107
- It's okay. - That's why I didn't write it.

1744
00:59:57,307 --> 00:59:58,407
I'm sure no one wrote this one.

1745
00:59:59,177 --> 01:00:01,847
(Ahn Jae Hyeon)

1746
01:00:01,977 --> 01:00:03,347
Gosh, that scared me.

1747
01:00:04,147 --> 01:00:06,147
- Jae Hyeon. - Gosh, that scared me.

1748
01:00:06,987 --> 01:00:08,057
Jae Hyeon.

1749
01:00:08,687 --> 01:00:10,886
- Hang on. What's with this mood? - No, I'm good.

1750
01:00:10,887 --> 01:00:12,386
- Shall I go? I'm fine. - What's up with the mood?

1751
01:00:12,387 --> 01:00:13,997
Shall I? I'm really fine.

1752
01:00:14,397 --> 01:00:15,656
No one wrote his name, right?

1753
01:00:15,657 --> 01:00:17,427
That's it.

1754
01:00:17,867 --> 01:00:19,396
(That's it.)

1755
01:00:19,397 --> 01:00:20,736
You have to go along those lines, for sure.

1756
01:00:20,737 --> 01:00:22,166
I wrote my buddy's name.

1757
01:00:22,167 --> 01:00:24,067
(Shin Seung Hwan)

1758
01:00:24,307 --> 01:00:25,937
(Oh, what a relief.)

1759
01:00:26,067 --> 01:00:27,306
Seung Hwan, Ju Hwan.

1760
01:00:27,307 --> 01:00:29,237
- Yes, okay. - You should write one of them.

1761
01:00:30,207 --> 01:00:33,246
(But Seung Ho is quiet for some reason.)

1762
01:00:33,247 --> 01:00:34,846
But Seung Ho's name...

1763
01:00:34,847 --> 01:00:37,186
is similar to Seung Hwan. Didn't he write that one too?

1764
01:00:37,187 --> 01:00:40,716
Seung Ho's facial expression since he saw Jin's name has been...

1765
01:00:40,717 --> 01:00:42,357
- He hasn't been talking much. - He doesn't look good.

1766
01:00:42,787 --> 01:00:43,987
Is it just his poker face?

1767
01:00:44,257 --> 01:00:46,527
I thought no one would've written Seung Hwan's name this time.

1768
01:00:46,797 --> 01:00:48,596
- Jin is a bit... - It's risky.

1769
01:00:48,597 --> 01:00:50,697
He didn't look happy since then. Why is that?

1770
01:00:51,097 --> 01:00:53,026
I think this is the second jjajang ramyeon incident.

1771
01:00:53,027 --> 01:00:55,937
But didn't he write several characters earlier?

1772
01:00:56,167 --> 01:00:57,507
I think he wrote it in English.

1773
01:00:57,907 --> 01:00:58,907
Then, Choi Daniel?

1774
01:00:58,908 --> 01:01:00,077
- I don't know. - I think he wrote it in English.

1775
01:01:00,207 --> 01:01:02,807
(The most anxious)

1776
01:01:03,107 --> 01:01:04,507
I think he wrote it in English.

1777
01:01:04,907 --> 01:01:09,046
- Then, Choi Daniel? - Pani!

1778
01:01:09,047 --> 01:01:11,316
Pani Bottle!

1779
01:01:11,317 --> 01:01:13,556
(Pani Bottle)

1780
01:01:13,557 --> 01:01:15,486
(They succeed in the telepathy game.)

1781
01:01:15,487 --> 01:01:16,586
We're good.

1782
01:01:16,587 --> 01:01:17,987
- This is called telepathy. - You've succeeded.

1783
01:01:18,127 --> 01:01:20,227
Then, we'll give you these.

1784
01:01:20,897 --> 01:01:22,396
First of all, let's wash up.

1785
01:01:22,397 --> 01:01:23,866
Hey, first of all...

1786
01:01:23,867 --> 01:01:26,596
You can have some personal time to wash up with the water you got.

1787
01:01:26,597 --> 01:01:28,866
- Then, prepare for breakfast. - Okay.

1788
01:01:28,867 --> 01:01:30,907
But we can't prepare for breakfast without water.

1789
01:01:31,367 --> 01:01:33,007
Oh, then we can't wash up with this.

1790
01:01:33,577 --> 01:01:35,476
That's what I mean. That's why I said that.

1791
01:01:35,477 --> 01:01:38,076
Right, this is for the five of us.

1792
01:01:38,077 --> 01:01:39,947
(They'll probably run out of water after all five wash up.)

1793
01:01:40,077 --> 01:01:41,477
Hey, then...

1794
01:01:42,247 --> 01:01:43,317
Don't wash up.

1795
01:01:43,847 --> 01:01:45,186
- What? - Don't wash up.

1796
01:01:45,187 --> 01:01:47,157
- What use is it to wash up? - He's right.

1797
01:01:47,857 --> 01:01:49,556
Don't wash up. We have to eat with that too.

1798
01:01:49,557 --> 01:01:51,526
- We have to eat. - Yes, we should eat.

1799
01:01:51,527 --> 01:01:52,827
You guys eat a lot.

1800
01:01:52,957 --> 01:01:54,797
- This should be enough for food. - Okay.

1801
01:01:55,057 --> 01:01:56,927
I'll cook delicious kimchi stew for you.

1802
01:01:57,097 --> 01:01:59,197
(Current time, 9am)

1803
01:01:59,697 --> 01:02:00,996
(It's time to prepare breakfast now.)

1804
01:02:00,997 --> 01:02:02,896
Gosh, we're short on water. This is bad.

1805
01:02:02,897 --> 01:02:04,437
Right now, I need to go to the bathroom...

1806
01:02:04,867 --> 01:02:05,867
For what? To wash up?

1807
01:02:05,868 --> 01:02:07,237
- No, the toilet. - The toilet.

1808
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:08,677
Use the water from the pool.

1809
01:02:09,107 --> 01:02:10,146
- The pool water? - Yes.

1810
01:02:10,147 --> 01:02:11,376
We can use the water from the pool.

1811
01:02:11,377 --> 01:02:13,207
- Oh, for the toilet... - You can use that for the toilet.

1812
01:02:14,077 --> 01:02:16,217
(The empty tank they used yesterday)

1813
01:02:16,917 --> 01:02:18,247
- Let's bring water in this. - Okay.

1814
01:02:18,747 --> 01:02:20,587
I can get water now, even if there are bugs.

1815
01:02:21,217 --> 01:02:23,527
I mean, why couldn't you get water yesterday? Is that scary?

1816
01:02:23,627 --> 01:02:25,227
Tae Hyun, the bugs were huge.

1817
01:02:25,387 --> 01:02:27,697
- I'll just dunk this. - Sure, you can do that.

1818
01:02:27,897 --> 01:02:30,127
Hey, it's hard to dunk it that way. Put it in sideways.

1819
01:02:30,467 --> 01:02:31,597
Are you a fool?

1820
01:02:32,367 --> 01:02:34,036
You were trying to push that in vertically.

1821
01:02:34,037 --> 01:02:36,607
(So, the tank full of pool water...)

1822
01:02:37,607 --> 01:02:39,767
(and Sang Uk, who had urgent needs...)

1823
01:02:41,207 --> 01:02:42,576
This is a masterpiece.

1824
01:02:42,577 --> 01:02:44,047
(And the eldest brother who asked to relieve himself)

1825
01:02:48,677 --> 01:02:52,047
(Even refilling the tank himself)

1826
01:02:54,157 --> 01:02:55,517
- You must need to use the toilet. - Yes.

1827
01:02:55,817 --> 01:02:58,056
- Do you need something? - No, you can go ahead.

1828
01:02:58,057 --> 01:02:59,587
Let me know if you want to go.

1829
01:02:59,927 --> 01:03:03,197
Hey, make sure we don't confuse that with our drinking water.

1830
01:03:04,427 --> 01:03:07,797
Everyone is adjusting so well to the changes in circumstances.

1831
01:03:07,967 --> 01:03:10,507
We don't complain and just bring water from the pool.

1832
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:11,736
Brush my teeth.

1833
01:03:11,737 --> 01:03:13,507
Hey, we're eating anyway. Do you want to brush them after?

1834
01:03:13,537 --> 01:03:14,537
Okay.

1835
01:03:14,538 --> 01:03:16,437
- We should cook. - Right.

1836
01:03:16,677 --> 01:03:17,977
- What do we... - The ingredients...

1837
01:03:18,707 --> 01:03:19,847
Hey, we have a lot of stuff.

1838
01:03:20,047 --> 01:03:21,047
Hey, this meat...

1839
01:03:21,048 --> 01:03:23,617
It would taste so good if we added all this pork belly.

1840
01:03:23,787 --> 01:03:25,087
What kind of stew are you making?

1841
01:03:25,487 --> 01:03:27,086
Pork kimchi stew.

1842
01:03:27,087 --> 01:03:29,416
Then, we can add pork to the stew and grill the beef.

1843
01:03:29,417 --> 01:03:31,827
Right? We have a lot. This is plenty of food.

1844
01:03:32,627 --> 01:03:34,157
Gosh, this is practically a barbecue restaurant.

1845
01:03:34,957 --> 01:03:36,057
Hey, I'll help you.

1846
01:03:36,897 --> 01:03:39,966
The meat should be about this size to put in the stew. See that?

1847
01:03:39,967 --> 01:03:41,336
- The size? Okay. - Cut them about that size.

1848
01:03:41,337 --> 01:03:43,297
Cut both of these up for me.

1849
01:03:43,907 --> 01:03:47,037
(Sang Uk, the assistant chef, cuts the meat.)

1850
01:03:47,777 --> 01:03:51,407
(Main chef Yi Kyung starts cooking in earnest.)

1851
01:03:51,677 --> 01:03:54,777
The water we're supposed to use to cook... What's it called?

1852
01:03:55,017 --> 01:03:56,076
Where is it?

1853
01:03:56,077 --> 01:03:58,117
(Oh, right. The water.)

1854
01:03:58,687 --> 01:03:59,817
This should be it, right?

1855
01:04:01,517 --> 01:04:02,917
This can't be the water for the toilet, right?

1856
01:04:03,857 --> 01:04:04,986
(Thankfully, it is their drinking water.)

1857
01:04:04,987 --> 01:04:07,527
Goodness, let's cook the kimchi stew first.

1858
01:04:08,057 --> 01:04:09,496
(Yi Kyung cuts up the kimchi for the stew...)

1859
01:04:09,497 --> 01:04:12,027
(and adds it to the pot after getting the drinking water.)

1860
01:04:15,967 --> 01:04:17,736
(He naturally goes to turn on the tap.)

1861
01:04:17,737 --> 01:04:20,206
Gosh, that's driving me crazy. We can't use the tap water.

1862
01:04:20,207 --> 01:04:21,277
(Oh, right. We don't have running water.)

1863
01:04:21,807 --> 01:04:25,547
Gosh, can you get this... Can you pour this a bit?

1864
01:04:25,807 --> 01:04:26,846
Okay.

1865
01:04:26,847 --> 01:04:29,417
(He can't take it anymore and washes his hands with the drinking water.)

1866
01:04:29,517 --> 01:04:31,147
Just a little bit at a time.

1867
01:04:32,487 --> 01:04:33,817
Can you pour it out bit by bit?

1868
01:04:35,317 --> 01:04:37,526
No, that's too much. That's good. Thanks.

1869
01:04:37,527 --> 01:04:39,057
I have to cook, so let me wash my hands once.

1870
01:04:39,557 --> 01:04:40,696
That's it. Now.

1871
01:04:40,697 --> 01:04:41,697
- Now? - Yes.

1872
01:04:41,698 --> 01:04:44,497
(Dribbling)

1873
01:04:45,027 --> 01:04:46,066
(He washes his hands while being incredibly frugal.)

1874
01:04:46,067 --> 01:04:47,197
There we go.

1875
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:49,167
That's good.

1876
01:04:49,737 --> 01:04:51,106
(He doesn't even notice what he did wrong.)

1877
01:04:51,107 --> 01:04:52,237
Hang on, then...

1878
01:04:52,707 --> 01:04:54,807
This is unbelievably heavy. So heavy.

1879
01:04:55,277 --> 01:04:56,707
Hey, if you say that it's heavy...

1880
01:04:57,847 --> 01:04:59,407
You're going to grill meat again, aren't you?

1881
01:04:59,807 --> 01:05:01,677
Then, I'll play in the water.

1882
01:05:03,217 --> 01:05:04,487
(Taking it off)

1883
01:05:05,617 --> 01:05:09,187
(He leaves the grilling to the guys who are good at it...)

1884
01:05:09,517 --> 01:05:13,597
(and cleverly gets ready to play in the pool.)

1885
01:05:13,957 --> 01:05:15,957
(Peekaboo)

1886
01:05:16,297 --> 01:05:17,827
(This is so much fun.)

1887
01:05:18,227 --> 01:05:20,467
(Grinning)

1888
01:05:21,297 --> 01:05:24,907
(He enjoys freedom in the water by himself even without much of it.)

1889
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:28,537
(And there is one person who can't leave him in peace.)

1890
01:05:28,807 --> 01:05:30,247
If it isn't Cha Dragon.

1891
01:05:31,177 --> 01:05:33,547
(Cha Dragon?)

1892
01:05:33,647 --> 01:05:34,817
Gosh, why won't this work?

1893
01:05:35,517 --> 01:05:38,747
(Cha Dragon seems rather clumsy.)

1894
01:05:38,887 --> 01:05:40,256
I'll hold it for you.

1895
01:05:40,257 --> 01:05:41,257
(Laughing)

1896
01:05:42,457 --> 01:05:44,157
(Leave me alone.)

1897
01:05:44,627 --> 01:05:45,887
Oh, this is nice.

1898
01:05:46,487 --> 01:05:47,527
Oh, goodness.

1899
01:05:47,957 --> 01:05:49,997
(Without anyone,)

1900
01:05:50,397 --> 01:05:52,327
(he enjoys a life full of water all by himself.)

1901
01:05:52,827 --> 01:05:54,366
(It's my paradise.)

1902
01:05:54,367 --> 01:05:55,597
This is so nice.

1903
01:05:57,507 --> 01:06:00,007
What are we having for breakfast? What's on the menu?

1904
01:06:00,277 --> 01:06:01,407
The menu for today?

1905
01:06:04,747 --> 01:06:05,747
(Suddenly acting elegant)

1906
01:06:05,748 --> 01:06:06,876
I was going to have a Tomahawk steak.

1907
01:06:06,877 --> 01:06:08,846
The menu today is a Tomahawk steak...

1908
01:06:08,847 --> 01:06:10,247
(Today's breakfast: Western cuisine, Tomahawk steak)

1909
01:06:10,887 --> 01:06:12,917
(Adding a bit of intellectual flair)

1910
01:06:14,587 --> 01:06:16,787
Hey, Butler Shin. What's on the menu?

1911
01:06:17,227 --> 01:06:20,456
Yes, sir. It's kimchi stew with top loin...

1912
01:06:20,457 --> 01:06:22,657
and grilled top blade.

1913
01:06:22,927 --> 01:06:26,066
Weren't they going to make jjajang ramyeon too?

1914
01:06:26,067 --> 01:06:27,137
Yes, sir.

1915
01:06:27,237 --> 01:06:28,967
Don't people these days mix that with something else?

1916
01:06:29,397 --> 01:06:31,536
It's popular to mix Buldak ramyeon...

1917
01:06:31,537 --> 01:06:33,337
with jjajang ramyeon these days.

1918
01:06:33,877 --> 01:06:36,677
- Is that very spicy? - It's not that spicy.

1919
01:06:36,707 --> 01:06:37,807
- Okay. - Yes, sir.

1920
01:06:38,047 --> 01:06:40,577
Also, what do we have for drinks?

1921
01:06:40,847 --> 01:06:43,116
For drinks, we have a sweet hazelnut latte.

1922
01:06:43,117 --> 01:06:45,147
- Hey, this... - Kept in pool water,

1923
01:06:45,447 --> 01:06:46,816
made by Tae Hyun Company,

1924
01:06:46,817 --> 01:06:48,756
here's a hazelnut latte, prepared for you.

1925
01:06:48,757 --> 01:06:49,786
- This is a latte? - Yes, sir.

1926
01:06:49,787 --> 01:06:52,157
- Oh, really? - Do you need anything else, sir?

1927
01:06:52,357 --> 01:06:54,696
Gosh, have them cook faster.

1928
01:06:54,697 --> 01:06:56,456
Yes, sir. I'll do my best.

1929
01:06:56,457 --> 01:06:57,926
(Bowing)

1930
01:06:57,927 --> 01:06:59,427
(Stepping backwards)

1931
01:06:59,567 --> 01:07:00,697
(An elegant turn)

1932
01:07:01,397 --> 01:07:03,167
(Throwing)

1933
01:07:03,497 --> 01:07:05,807
(An edgy finish)

1934
01:07:06,137 --> 01:07:08,507
(The chairman is satisfied.)

1935
01:07:08,977 --> 01:07:10,646
All right. This is done.

1936
01:07:10,647 --> 01:07:11,677
Okay.

1937
01:07:13,107 --> 01:07:15,846
How much meat are we putting in there?

1938
01:07:15,847 --> 01:07:18,717
Hey, we bought 7kg of meat.

1939
01:07:18,887 --> 01:07:20,386
But combined with the meat we had when we ate out yesterday,

1940
01:07:20,387 --> 01:07:21,787
we ate over 10kg. Did you know that?

1941
01:07:22,187 --> 01:07:23,926
- Right, it should be about 10kg. - Yes.

1942
01:07:23,927 --> 01:07:25,927
The Tomahawk steak is super heavy too.

1943
01:07:26,927 --> 01:07:28,297
That looks tasty just by itself.

1944
01:07:28,927 --> 01:07:30,296
- It looks good, right? - Yes.

1945
01:07:30,297 --> 01:07:32,197
(They ate so much, but they want to eat again.)

1946
01:07:32,353 --> 01:07:34,753
Can you pour that water in here?

1947
01:07:35,397 --> 01:07:37,036
This water? Okay.

1948
01:07:37,037 --> 01:07:38,806
- I have to pour it in there, but... - Oh, right.

1949
01:07:38,807 --> 01:07:40,007
You can just tilt it.

1950
01:07:41,037 --> 01:07:42,176
(Their drinking water is being used like tap water.)

1951
01:07:42,177 --> 01:07:43,307
- Tell me when to stop. - Okay.

1952
01:07:43,407 --> 01:07:45,247
We're going to boil this and eat it anyway.

1953
01:07:47,917 --> 01:07:48,917
Let's take a break.
(Stop for now!)

1954
01:07:50,617 --> 01:07:52,887
(He adds water to the stew.)

1955
01:07:54,417 --> 01:07:57,087
One more time?

1956
01:07:57,587 --> 01:07:59,027
No. Let's see how it look after it boils.

1957
01:07:59,987 --> 01:08:01,726
(Let's add more water if it comes out salty.)

1958
01:08:01,727 --> 01:08:03,326
It looks tasty already.

1959
01:08:03,327 --> 01:08:05,527
(Vegetables for the stew need to be rinsed.)

1960
01:08:05,927 --> 01:08:08,066
- Sang Uk, pour me some water. - Okay.

1961
01:08:08,067 --> 01:08:09,897
(Using the household water for the 3rd time)

1962
01:08:10,307 --> 01:08:11,337
Stop.

1963
01:08:12,267 --> 01:08:13,367
I can't use more.

1964
01:08:13,737 --> 01:08:15,337
I just need to rinse these.

1965
01:08:15,737 --> 01:08:17,907
We were using so much water in our daily lives.

1966
01:08:18,347 --> 01:08:19,806
- That's right. - We were using so much water.

1967
01:08:19,807 --> 01:08:22,647
We were using so much water. Seriously.

1968
01:08:22,917 --> 01:08:24,587
It came out easily when we turned on the faucet.

1969
01:08:25,487 --> 01:08:26,546
Chop it.

1970
01:08:26,547 --> 01:08:32,157
(Despite the lack of water, they show off their cooking skills.)

1971
01:08:33,087 --> 01:08:34,927
I think there are ten servings of food.

1972
01:08:35,497 --> 01:08:38,526
The kimchi juice contains fish sauce.

1973
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,597
We need to add it.

1974
01:08:39,697 --> 01:08:42,766
(He uses the kimchi juice to give depth to the taste.)

1975
01:08:42,767 --> 01:08:44,506
- We don't have tuna sauce. - No.

1976
01:08:44,507 --> 01:08:47,477
- Thus, you use the kimchi juice. - It contains fish sauce.

1977
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:49,437
(Tasting)

1978
01:08:49,777 --> 01:08:50,806
It's tasty.

1979
01:08:50,807 --> 01:08:51,947
(Thankfully, saltiness is just right.)

1980
01:08:52,247 --> 01:08:53,276
You're really good.

1981
01:08:53,277 --> 01:08:54,277
(While the Korean part of the breakfast is nearly done)

1982
01:08:54,278 --> 01:08:55,317
It looks tasty.

1983
01:08:55,817 --> 01:08:57,486
- Mr. Chairman. - You're back.

1984
01:08:57,487 --> 01:08:58,131
Yes.

1985
01:08:58,787 --> 01:09:01,157
- We say hello. - This is great.

1986
01:09:01,587 --> 01:09:03,617
This is Europe's Natuur.

1987
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:07,156
This is Natuur ice cream. Please hold it for a second.

1988
01:09:07,157 --> 01:09:08,196
Okay.

1989
01:09:08,197 --> 01:09:09,227
(Hurry up and give me a taste.)

1990
01:09:09,741 --> 01:09:10,741
There you go.

1991
01:09:10,828 --> 01:09:11,867
(He delivers it straight to the mouth.)

1992
01:09:12,367 --> 01:09:13,426
It's so tasty.

1993
01:09:13,427 --> 01:09:14,937
(Satisfied)

1994
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:15,875
Thank you.

1995
01:09:16,897 --> 01:09:18,607
I'll bring the next item in the course.

1996
01:09:19,607 --> 01:09:20,907
(Throwing)

1997
01:09:21,837 --> 01:09:24,307
(An edgy exit)

1998
01:09:24,547 --> 01:09:25,576
(What comes next is the Western cuisine.)

1999
01:09:25,577 --> 01:09:27,977
Hey, we don't have enough meat.

2000
01:09:28,917 --> 01:09:30,046
(How is this not enough?)

2001
01:09:30,047 --> 01:09:31,317
It's nice.

2002
01:09:32,017 --> 01:09:33,756
It isn't a lot. It's only 200g.

2003
01:09:33,757 --> 01:09:34,957
(The carnivorous men are on another level.)

2004
01:09:35,357 --> 01:09:37,787
(Serious)

2005
01:09:37,887 --> 01:09:40,226
I plan to grill the top blade first.

2006
01:09:40,227 --> 01:09:42,997
(Top blade goes on the grill at 10o'clock in the morning.)

2007
01:09:44,497 --> 01:09:47,037
(Team Western Cuisine begins to cook solemnly.)

2008
01:09:57,547 --> 01:09:58,547
(The man who likes his meat rare eats a piece after flipping it.)

2009
01:09:58,548 --> 01:09:59,577
If you eat it...

2010
01:10:03,377 --> 01:10:05,516
(Dong Hyun eats a piece that's nicely cooked.)

2011
01:10:05,517 --> 01:10:06,517
It's nice, right?

2012
01:10:06,887 --> 01:10:08,356
(His facial expression shows his happiness.)

2013
01:10:08,357 --> 01:10:09,387
It's tasty.

2014
01:10:09,417 --> 01:10:10,587
It won't be tasty once it cools down.

2015
01:10:12,527 --> 01:10:13,586
(So that it won't cool down,)

2016
01:10:13,587 --> 01:10:15,597
(we'll eat it right away.)

2017
01:10:16,797 --> 01:10:17,826
It shouldn't cool down.

2018
01:10:17,827 --> 01:10:18,997
(The chairman shows up after playing in the pool.)

2019
01:10:20,267 --> 01:10:21,396
Fill your mouth.

2020
01:10:21,397 --> 01:10:22,596
(Mr. Chairman, have a bite before it cools down.)

2021
01:10:22,597 --> 01:10:23,907
It won't be tasty once it cools down.

2022
01:10:24,307 --> 01:10:25,307
(Nodding)

2023
01:10:25,308 --> 01:10:27,037
Are you guys having a meal here?

2024
01:10:28,307 --> 01:10:29,307
- No. - No.

2025
01:10:29,308 --> 01:10:30,947
It won't be tasty once it cools down.

2026
01:10:31,047 --> 01:10:33,777
(It won't be tasty once it cools down.)

2027
01:10:34,177 --> 01:10:36,876
- I think we should deliver it. - Okay.

2028
01:10:36,877 --> 01:10:38,346
(The grilled top blade is complete.)

2029
01:10:38,347 --> 01:10:39,586
- Let me know how it goes. - Okay.

2030
01:10:39,587 --> 01:10:41,156
(It gets delivered to the breakfast location.)

2031
01:10:41,157 --> 01:10:42,717
It's smoky.

2032
01:10:44,387 --> 01:10:46,587
(Only one breakfast item remains.)

2033
01:10:47,127 --> 01:10:50,567
(The much-anticipated tomahawk steak.)

2034
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:53,066
This is incredible.

2035
01:10:53,067 --> 01:10:55,167
(He's as serious as ever.)

2036
01:10:55,597 --> 01:11:00,007
(Waiting for the member's tasty meal)

2037
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,436
(After a long wait)

2038
01:11:02,437 --> 01:11:04,207
It's getting smoked properly.

2039
01:11:06,647 --> 01:11:07,647
It's to die for.

2040
01:11:07,648 --> 01:11:09,447
- Dong Hyun. - Yes?

2041
01:11:09,517 --> 01:11:11,447
- Come and eat. - Okay. Gosh, it's hot.

2042
01:11:12,287 --> 01:11:14,417
(He goes back to the members...)

2043
01:11:14,787 --> 01:11:17,427
(like a chieftain whose hands are full of catch.)

2044
01:11:18,587 --> 01:11:20,456
(Ooga ooga)

2045
01:11:20,457 --> 01:11:22,097
- Dong Hyun. - Yes?

2046
01:11:23,527 --> 01:11:25,267
Give me a plate.

2047
01:11:26,097 --> 01:11:27,197
(Exclaiming)

2048
01:11:27,337 --> 01:11:28,537
A plate.

2049
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:30,396
Put them on here.

2050
01:11:30,397 --> 01:11:31,406
Here.

2051
01:11:31,407 --> 01:11:33,107
(Today's hunt was a success.)

2052
01:11:33,367 --> 01:11:34,437
(Exclaiming)

2053
01:11:34,637 --> 01:11:37,777
- Let's hurry up and begin. - Take a seat.

2054
01:11:38,807 --> 01:11:40,617
Hey, it's 10am.

2055
01:11:42,575 --> 01:11:44,216
We're having this meal at 10am.

2056
01:11:44,217 --> 01:11:45,217
(It's a typical meal you have at 10am!)

2057
01:11:45,218 --> 01:11:46,316
This is incredible.

2058
01:11:46,317 --> 01:11:48,117
(From the tomahawk steak...)

2059
01:11:48,587 --> 01:11:49,956
(to the grilled top blade that shouldn't go cold)

2060
01:11:49,957 --> 01:11:52,956
- Well done, everyone. - Thank you for the food.

2061
01:11:52,957 --> 01:11:54,296
- This is incredible. - Thank you for the food.

2062
01:11:54,297 --> 01:11:55,657
Let's eat.

2063
01:11:55,827 --> 01:11:57,727
This stew is a bit bland.

2064
01:11:59,227 --> 01:12:01,266
Don't be ridiculous. It's perfect.

2065
01:12:01,267 --> 01:12:02,336
Is it great?

2066
01:12:02,337 --> 01:12:03,337
(Thank goodness.)

2067
01:12:03,338 --> 01:12:06,007
Gosh, it has big chunks of meat.

2068
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:07,737
What do you think? It isn't spicy, right?

2069
01:12:08,237 --> 01:12:09,307
It's a little bit spicy.

2070
01:12:10,607 --> 01:12:11,707
It's tasty!

2071
01:12:11,977 --> 01:12:13,106
The kimchi stew is tasty.

2072
01:12:13,107 --> 01:12:14,116
(Seung Ho eats the kimchi stew.)

2073
01:12:14,117 --> 01:12:15,147
The kimchi stew is tasty.

2074
01:12:16,747 --> 01:12:18,416
- It's tasty. - Is it good?

2075
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:19,617
It's tasty.

2076
01:12:20,557 --> 01:12:21,957
You made it really well.

2077
01:12:22,887 --> 01:12:24,557
- It's tastier than before. - Right?

2078
01:12:25,287 --> 01:12:27,497
It made me happy to add so much meat to the stew.

2079
01:12:27,597 --> 01:12:28,757
It's so tasty.

2080
01:12:29,627 --> 01:12:30,627
It's tasty.

2081
01:12:30,628 --> 01:12:32,397
Did you add all the pork in here?

2082
01:12:32,797 --> 01:12:34,566
- Yes. - We added all of it.

2083
01:12:34,567 --> 01:12:35,737
By any chance,

2084
01:12:36,397 --> 01:12:37,736
did you grill all the meat?

2085
01:12:37,737 --> 01:12:38,737
We grilled all of it.

2086
01:12:39,607 --> 01:12:41,377
- We used up the pork. - Wait.

2087
01:12:41,477 --> 01:12:43,336
- All the meat we bought yesterday? - All 7kg of meat.

2088
01:12:43,337 --> 01:12:44,346
- All of it? - All of it.

2089
01:12:44,347 --> 01:12:45,947
- We used all of it. - We finished it in the end.

2090
01:12:46,077 --> 01:12:47,776
We ate 10kg of meat...

2091
01:12:47,777 --> 01:12:48,777
over the course of 2 days and 1 night.

2092
01:12:49,917 --> 01:12:50,917
This is...

2093
01:12:50,918 --> 01:12:52,087
(It's too early to be surprised.)

2094
01:12:53,087 --> 01:12:54,456
The tomahawk steak is here.

2095
01:12:54,457 --> 01:12:55,587
(It's time to try the much-anticipated tomahawk.)

2096
01:12:55,787 --> 01:12:57,226
Dong Hyun, the doneness is amazing.

2097
01:12:57,227 --> 01:12:58,787
- Really? - Good.

2098
01:12:59,153 --> 01:13:00,623
- I'll cut it like this. - Here.

2099
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,340
- I'll cut it like this. - Here.

2100
01:13:02,527 --> 01:13:03,756
(This is it!)

2101
01:13:03,757 --> 01:13:04,827
Here.

2102
01:13:06,467 --> 01:13:07,797
It's totally a steak.

2103
01:13:07,967 --> 01:13:09,367
(My goodness!)

2104
01:13:10,297 --> 01:13:11,737
(He knits his brows because it's so tasty.)

2105
01:13:12,467 --> 01:13:14,406
(The chieftain who grilled the meat also tries a piece.)

2106
01:13:14,407 --> 01:13:15,477
It's tasty.

2107
01:13:16,007 --> 01:13:17,136
It's tasty.

2108
01:13:17,137 --> 01:13:18,206
(Tae Hyun gnaws on the bone.)

2109
01:13:18,207 --> 01:13:18,792
It's tasty.

2110
01:13:20,077 --> 01:13:21,116
It's tasty.

2111
01:13:21,117 --> 01:13:22,146
(The members become obsessed with the tomahawk steak.)

2112
01:13:22,147 --> 01:13:23,546
The doneness is just right.

2113
01:13:23,547 --> 01:13:26,187
I think the meat on the bone is tastier.

2114
01:13:26,317 --> 01:13:28,817
(The meat on the bone is tasty.)

2115
01:13:29,117 --> 01:13:31,157
(Shall I do the same?)

2116
01:13:36,597 --> 01:13:38,266
(Amazed)

2117
01:13:38,267 --> 01:13:39,367
I think I've seen something like that...

2118
01:13:39,527 --> 01:13:40,937
in a textbook.

2119
01:13:42,137 --> 01:13:43,237
Ooga, ooga.

2120
01:13:43,597 --> 01:13:44,666
During a history class...

2121
01:13:44,667 --> 01:13:46,406
I think I saw that while learning about the tribal society.

2122
01:13:46,407 --> 01:13:47,807
Is that Australopithecus?

2123
01:13:52,877 --> 01:13:56,046
Back in the days, tribesmen threw rocks to hunt.

2124
01:13:56,047 --> 01:13:57,047
(Back in the days, tribesmen threw rocks to hunt.)

2125
01:13:59,617 --> 01:14:00,887
After the meat got grilled over fire,

2126
01:14:02,017 --> 01:14:04,887
the man of high social status ate the tasty cut first.

2127
01:14:06,887 --> 01:14:09,297
That man is in sixth place within the tribe.

2128
01:14:10,557 --> 01:14:11,567
Sixth place.

2129
01:14:13,467 --> 01:14:16,496
(He's the funniest one among Handsome Guys.)

2130
01:14:16,497 --> 01:14:18,507
Not even the king of the animals would eat like this.

2131
01:14:18,637 --> 01:14:19,807
This is impressive.

2132
01:14:20,007 --> 01:14:21,807
We're good at communal living.

2133
01:14:22,307 --> 01:14:23,336
I can't believe it.

2134
01:14:23,337 --> 01:14:24,547
(Welcome to the netherworld of dirty dishes.)

2135
01:14:25,077 --> 01:14:27,646
Imagine doing the dishes without water.

2136
01:14:27,647 --> 01:14:30,716
Let's fill a big bowl with water.

2137
01:14:30,717 --> 01:14:31,817
Here it is.

2138
01:14:32,087 --> 01:14:33,547
Let's fill it with soapy water...

2139
01:14:33,647 --> 01:14:35,187
and soak the dirty dishes.

2140
01:14:35,357 --> 01:14:36,417
Let's add some dish soap.

2141
01:14:36,687 --> 01:14:37,826
It's practically the Joseon dynasty.

2142
01:14:37,827 --> 01:14:38,887
(Yi Kyung the problem solver)

2143
01:14:38,957 --> 01:14:41,627
Let's use this opportunity to wash our hands.

2144
01:14:42,597 --> 01:14:45,897
(They use this opportunity to wash their hands.)

2145
01:14:45,927 --> 01:14:47,267
This is ridiculous.

2146
01:14:48,797 --> 01:14:52,867
(They soak the dirty dishes in the soapy water.)

2147
01:14:53,537 --> 01:14:57,377
I'll pour water, so rinse one item at a time.

2148
01:14:57,707 --> 01:14:59,807
(Trickling)

2149
01:15:00,147 --> 01:15:01,147
(Speed is...)

2150
01:15:01,148 --> 01:15:02,617
(a must.)

2151
01:15:06,687 --> 01:15:07,957
(Laughing)

2152
01:15:13,727 --> 01:15:14,727
Hold on.

2153
01:15:14,728 --> 01:15:15,996
(Panting)

2154
01:15:15,997 --> 01:15:17,197
Let's switch places.

2155
01:15:17,327 --> 01:15:19,467
It's okay. This is...

2156
01:15:20,397 --> 01:15:22,937
It's really hard to do the dishes.

2157
01:15:23,537 --> 01:15:24,537
Normally, we just turn on the faucet.
I know.

2158
01:15:27,137 --> 01:15:29,177
People must've poured out water to do the dishes in the past.

2159
01:15:30,537 --> 01:15:33,076
We don't realize this when we eat, but moms do this all the time.

2160
01:15:33,077 --> 01:15:34,146
(They learn how precious water is as they finish doing the dishes.)

2161
01:15:34,147 --> 01:15:36,577
That's right. They always soak the dishes in hot water.

2162
01:15:38,147 --> 01:15:39,516
Did you have a good meal?

2163
01:15:39,517 --> 01:15:40,547
- Yes. - Yes.

2164
01:15:40,687 --> 01:15:44,157
The five of you will follow me now.

2165
01:15:44,686 --> 01:15:46,845
- Do we need our luggage? - No, you can come as you are.

2166
01:15:46,887 --> 01:15:48,457
- Okay. - Shall I take off my socks?

2167
01:15:49,427 --> 01:15:51,026
- Shall we go as we are? - Shall we put on slippers?

2168
01:15:51,027 --> 01:15:52,097
Shall I bring a mouthguard?

2169
01:15:53,267 --> 01:15:54,467
Shall I bring a mouthguard?

2170
01:15:54,797 --> 01:15:56,037
- You can come as you are. - Shall we wear soccer cleats?

2171
01:15:56,167 --> 01:15:57,267
Shall we wear soccer cleats?

2172
01:15:57,367 --> 01:15:59,036
- Let's bring the protective gear. - I don't trust him.

2173
01:15:59,037 --> 01:16:00,107
Let's go as we are.

2174
01:16:00,447 --> 01:16:01,329
Will we do something outside?

2175
01:16:02,577 --> 01:16:03,577
Where are we going?

2176
01:16:03,877 --> 01:16:04,977
Will we go into the water?

2177
01:16:05,747 --> 01:16:06,409
That sounds nice.

2178
01:16:07,847 --> 01:16:08,877
Where are we going?

2179
01:16:09,677 --> 01:16:10,442
- What? - The neighboring house.

2180
01:16:10,917 --> 01:16:12,187
I guess we'll do something outside.

2181
01:16:13,317 --> 01:16:13,943
What?

2182
01:16:15,017 --> 01:16:15,956
What's that palm tree?

2183
01:16:18,027 --> 01:16:19,226
- What? - What's that?

2184
01:16:19,227 --> 01:16:20,826
Is it a present for our hard work?

2185
01:16:20,827 --> 01:16:22,426
(Is it a present for their hard work amidst the hot weather?)

2186
01:16:22,427 --> 01:16:23,857
Is it a present for our hard work?

2187
01:16:24,227 --> 01:16:26,227
(Cold ice cubes pour out.)

2188
01:16:26,967 --> 01:16:29,037
(There are fruity drinks that'll quench the thirst...)

2189
01:16:30,237 --> 01:16:33,737
(and an outdoor pool that'll make you want to jump in.)

2190
01:16:34,407 --> 01:16:37,747
(This is paradise.)

2191
01:16:37,807 --> 01:16:39,747
- Isn't this ice? - No way.

2192
01:16:40,307 --> 01:16:42,247
- It is. It's ice. - It's real ice.

2193
01:16:42,947 --> 01:16:44,587
- Hey! - Is there something?

2194
01:16:45,017 --> 01:16:46,017
(The ice wakes him up!)

2195
01:16:46,018 --> 01:16:47,217
- What? - This is the spot.

2196
01:16:47,817 --> 01:16:48,917
- What? - Hurry over here.

2197
01:16:49,287 --> 01:16:51,327
What? Why are guys being so nice?

2198
01:16:51,757 --> 01:16:53,786
That isn't the right place. Come here.

2199
01:16:53,787 --> 01:16:54,796
- What? - Come here.

2200
01:16:54,797 --> 01:16:56,327
- This is incredible. - Isn't this the right place?

2201
01:16:57,170 --> 01:16:58,210
It's this way.

2202
01:16:58,235 --> 01:16:59,605
- For goodness' sake. - Is that the place?

2203
01:17:00,097 --> 01:17:01,236
Why? What's this?

2204
01:17:01,237 --> 01:17:02,267
(They enter the place in a disappointed state.)

2205
01:17:02,367 --> 01:17:03,866
This is wrong.

2206
01:17:03,867 --> 01:17:04,907
(What's this place?)

2207
01:17:05,337 --> 01:17:06,467
What's this? I'm scared.

2208
01:17:06,492 --> 01:17:09,002
(A small, ordinary room?)

2209
01:17:09,170 --> 01:17:10,940
This is wrong.

2210
01:17:12,112 --> 01:17:13,342
What's this? I'm scared.

2211
01:17:13,410 --> 01:17:14,579
(A small, ordinary room?)

2212
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:15,810
(That was the first impression.)

2213
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,890
(The abundant fire creates...)

2214
01:17:22,250 --> 01:17:24,520
(intense heat.)

2215
01:17:25,090 --> 01:17:28,260
(It's the hot yellow clay sauna.)

2216
01:17:28,790 --> 01:17:30,489
The floor is heated!

2217
01:17:30,490 --> 01:17:31,600
What's this?

2218
01:17:31,860 --> 01:17:33,030
It's a high-temperature sauna.

2219
01:17:34,300 --> 01:17:35,469
(He carefully takes the first step.)

2220
01:17:35,470 --> 01:17:36,079
In the middle of summer?

2221
01:17:37,070 --> 01:17:38,339
(My goodness)

2222
01:17:38,340 --> 01:17:39,340
Yi Kyung.

2223
01:17:39,341 --> 01:17:40,599
You can enter in a wet state.

2224
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:41,670
You'll get dried up right away.

2225
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:43,309
You'll get dried up right away. Just come on in.

2226
01:17:43,310 --> 01:17:44,029
Gosh, it's hot!

2227
01:17:44,325 --> 01:17:45,965
Look at the way my feet stick. You'll get dried up right away.

2228
01:17:47,180 --> 01:17:47,975
It's hot.

2229
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:49,679
It's a high-temperature sauna.

2230
01:17:49,680 --> 01:17:50,750
It's hot.

2231
01:17:51,350 --> 01:17:53,419
- It's too hot. - We did well to wear socks.

2232
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:54,489
In this weather...

2233
01:17:54,490 --> 01:17:55,520
- I need socks. - This is insane.

2234
01:17:55,750 --> 01:17:56,750
Can I use your arm sleeves?

2235
01:17:56,751 --> 01:17:57,959
Did you make this?

2236
01:17:57,960 --> 01:17:58,671
It's hot in here.

2237
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:01,630
- It's hot. - Hurry up.

2238
01:18:02,130 --> 01:18:05,630
(Staff members enter the yellow clay sauna.)

2239
01:18:06,160 --> 01:18:07,229
The camera director is struggling.

2240
01:18:07,230 --> 01:18:08,399
(The hot floor makes the angle shake.)

2241
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,169
The camera director...

2242
01:18:10,170 --> 01:18:11,569
- Come on in. - It's a proper sauna.

2243
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:12,869
It's hot in here.

2244
01:18:12,870 --> 01:18:13,900
(It's hot in here.)

2245
01:18:13,940 --> 01:18:15,639
- What's this? - We'll close the door.

2246
01:18:15,640 --> 01:18:17,069
- Will you close the door? - Will you close the door?

2247
01:18:17,070 --> 01:18:18,179
Will you close the door for real?

2248
01:18:18,180 --> 01:18:19,240
Oh, my.

2249
01:18:19,380 --> 01:18:20,439
(Closing)

2250
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,609
Here, you'll wrap up Life in Shortage...

2251
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:23,649
(The door of the yellow clay sauna is closed.)

2252
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:25,920
with Escape the Shortage Game.

2253
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,219
- Escape the Shortage Game. - Hold on.

2254
01:18:27,220 --> 01:18:28,890
If we're playing as a group, we need to do a cheer.

2255
01:18:29,820 --> 01:18:30,920
All right.

2256
01:18:31,220 --> 01:18:33,119
After playing games,

2257
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,360
the winners will escape one at a time.

2258
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:37,900
- That's the setup outside. - That's right.

2259
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:39,159
You can either take a shower...

2260
01:18:39,160 --> 01:18:40,400
or enjoy what we set up.

2261
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:43,030
(The cooling station only the escaped ones can enjoy)

2262
01:18:43,300 --> 01:18:46,370
(They can watch the sauna through the monitor.)

2263
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:47,669
We need to escape to enjoy it?

2264
01:18:47,670 --> 01:18:49,170
- That's right. - This is unbelievable.

2265
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:51,580
- Let's begin the first game. - Okay.

2266
01:18:51,680 --> 01:18:53,580
- The first game is... - What is it?

2267
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:55,880
Avoid the Photos.

2268
01:18:55,910 --> 01:18:57,780
- That game? - What's that?

2269
01:18:57,920 --> 01:18:59,979
A blindfolded staff member will enter and take photos.

2270
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:01,289
The person who gets photographed the least...

2271
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:03,219
in the time limit of 30 seconds will escape.

2272
01:19:03,220 --> 01:19:04,489
Will you count the face?

2273
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:05,789
Let's go with the face.

2274
01:19:05,790 --> 01:19:06,790
But it'll count...

2275
01:19:06,791 --> 01:19:07,959
even if only one eye is showing.

2276
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:09,090
Okay.

2277
01:19:09,430 --> 01:19:11,099
- Will they take hundreds of photos? - Yes.

2278
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:12,729
- In 30 seconds. - They'll press the shutter nonstop.

2279
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:14,100
(It'll be difficult.)

2280
01:19:14,160 --> 01:19:15,870
We don't get it until we actually play the game.

2281
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:17,599
Let's ask them to enter right away.

2282
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:18,600
Let's hurry up and play the game.

2283
01:19:18,601 --> 01:19:19,670
Please come on in...

2284
01:19:19,900 --> 01:19:21,039
when we're asking nicely.

2285
01:19:21,040 --> 01:19:22,110
(Please come on in when we're asking nicely.)

2286
01:19:22,370 --> 01:19:24,410
Photographer, please enter.

2287
01:19:24,840 --> 01:19:26,279
- We need to avoid the camera. - Yes.

2288
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:28,049
If I stand like this, my face won't get photographed.

2289
01:19:28,050 --> 01:19:29,779
- The back of the head will be. - The head will be.

2290
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:30,879
- The head. - This part.

2291
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:32,150
Above the neck.

2292
01:19:32,450 --> 01:19:34,390
- Let's make it above the neck. - Okay.

2293
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:35,989
Let's begin.

2294
01:19:35,990 --> 01:19:36,990
Get ready.

2295
01:19:38,620 --> 01:19:42,460
(They get down to hide their faces as much as they can.)

2296
01:19:43,930 --> 01:19:46,460
(They get down to the floor quietly.)

2297
01:19:46,660 --> 01:19:47,770
Get ready.

2298
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:49,470
Set, go.

2299
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:51,240
(Clicking)

2300
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,040
(He presses the shutter quickly.)

2301
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,840
(Is he hiding between the legs?)

2302
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:00,340
(Clicking)

2303
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:03,480
(He runs away after getting photographed.)

2304
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,150
(Dodging)

2305
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:11,490
(Everyone is busy crawling on the floor.)

2306
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:17,900
(Sang Uk uses his tall height.)

2307
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:19,899
(He just needs to be above the camera.)

2308
01:20:19,900 --> 01:20:21,470
Ten seconds have passed.

2309
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,370
(He finds a safe area.)

2310
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,910
(He protects his face with his tall height.)

2311
01:20:32,380 --> 01:20:35,380
(Tae Hyun joins as well.)

2312
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:37,649
(They use Sang Uk as a shield.)

2313
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:39,250
Twenty seconds have passed.

2314
01:20:40,650 --> 01:20:43,450
(Hide the face as much as possible.)

2315
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:45,790
(20 seconds have passed.)

2316
01:20:48,060 --> 01:20:50,089
(They crawl on the floor...)

2317
01:20:50,090 --> 01:20:52,900
(and jump.)

2318
01:20:54,060 --> 01:20:56,800
(They make the photographer fall down.)

2319
01:20:58,970 --> 01:21:02,610
(They dream of escaping the sauna.)

2320
01:21:02,640 --> 01:21:03,640
Here.

2321
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:04,840
Here too.

2322
01:21:05,240 --> 01:21:06,380
Stop.

2323
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:09,349
(Laughing)

2324
01:21:09,350 --> 01:21:10,380
It's hot.

2325
01:21:10,450 --> 01:21:11,450
It's hot.

2326
01:21:11,451 --> 01:21:12,749
(They run out of energy.)

2327
01:21:12,750 --> 01:21:14,319
- He took photos. - That spot is so hot.

2328
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:15,320
Thank you for your hard work.
Thank you.

2329
01:21:16,321 --> 01:21:17,349
(A round of applause for the photographer)

2330
01:21:17,350 --> 01:21:18,360
His shorts didn't go down.

2331
01:21:18,690 --> 01:21:19,789
It's so hot in here.

2332
01:21:19,790 --> 01:21:20,819
Check the photos.

2333
01:21:20,820 --> 01:21:22,230
I think I'll place 1st.

2334
01:21:22,360 --> 01:21:23,789
- I'll check. - Go through the photos slowly.

2335
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:25,129
I really didn't do badly.

2336
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,330
- Let's check them together. - Please begin.

2337
01:21:26,355 --> 01:21:27,513
This is zero.

2338
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:29,730
- Won't you go backward? - All right.

2339
01:21:30,070 --> 01:21:31,399
- This is... - Sang Uk.

2340
01:21:31,400 --> 01:21:33,740
What will we do about a photo of Sang Uk's mouth?

2341
01:21:34,240 --> 01:21:36,139
Of course, it counts.

2342
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:38,139
- Does it count? - You got photographed.

2343
01:21:38,140 --> 01:21:39,179
Count your photos.

2344
01:21:39,180 --> 01:21:41,149
Anything above the neck counts.

2345
01:21:41,150 --> 01:21:43,049
- Sang Uk, one. - Won't you write it down?

2346
01:21:43,050 --> 01:21:44,779
- This doesn't count. - Why not?

2347
01:21:44,780 --> 01:21:46,179
Look at this. It's me.

2348
01:21:46,180 --> 01:21:47,249
(Sang Uk: 1, Yi Kyung: 1)

2349
01:21:47,250 --> 01:21:49,249
- Me, one. - You're like a wanted person.

2350
01:21:49,250 --> 01:21:50,890
- Me, 1. - Me, 1.

2351
01:21:51,590 --> 01:21:52,760
- Two. - Two.

2352
01:21:52,790 --> 01:21:53,959
- Who is it? - It...

2353
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:55,090
- Two. - It doesn't count.

2354
01:21:55,190 --> 01:21:56,190
- Three. - Three.

2355
01:21:56,191 --> 01:21:58,030
You got many photos taken as you removed the socks.

2356
01:21:58,400 --> 01:21:59,430
It's hot.

2357
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,469
You hide well.

2358
01:22:01,470 --> 01:22:02,500
(The face is hidden well.)

2359
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:04,500
What's this?

2360
01:22:04,501 --> 01:22:05,669
That's Dong Hyun.

2361
01:22:05,670 --> 01:22:06,769
- Is that me? - You're right.

2362
01:22:06,770 --> 01:22:07,970
- Dong Hyun. - You're right.

2363
01:22:08,510 --> 01:22:09,809
- Dong Hyun, one. - When did he get photographed?

2364
01:22:09,810 --> 01:22:10,909
(He got photographed as he ran away quickly!)

2365
01:22:10,910 --> 01:22:11,980
How did you find it?

2366
01:22:12,310 --> 01:22:13,339
- Who is it? - It's Dong Hyun.

2367
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:15,550
- It's Dong Hyun. - It's Dong Hyun.

2368
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:17,109
For goodness' sake.

2369
01:22:17,110 --> 01:22:19,419
There are no photos of me.

2370
01:22:19,420 --> 01:22:20,880
- Yu Kyung. - It isn't me.

2371
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:22,089
This figure is wearing a white top and a white hat.

2372
01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:23,950
It's you. It's obvious.

2373
01:22:24,520 --> 01:22:25,560
Does this count?

2374
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,860
- It's your call. Yi Kyung, four. - Okay.

2375
01:22:27,890 --> 01:22:29,359
Dong Hyun and I got photographed so many times.

2376
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,859
(Sang Uk: 1, Yi Kyung: 4, Dong Hyun: 2)

2377
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:32,159
- Does this one count? - Okay.

2378
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,929
- It's you. - Any part of the face counts.

2379
01:22:33,930 --> 01:22:35,730
It's already meaningless for you guys.

2380
01:22:36,030 --> 01:22:37,300
One more photo of me.

2381
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:38,900
- Yi Kyung, two. - One more photo of me.

2382
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:40,169
- Yi Kyung got photographed a lot. - One more photo of me.

2383
01:22:40,170 --> 01:22:41,269
It's meaningless for you guys.

2384
01:22:41,270 --> 01:22:42,510
- It's me versus Seung Ho. - The end.

2385
01:22:42,610 --> 01:22:43,940
Seung Ho and I didn't get photographed.

2386
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:45,610
- Right? - The two of you...

2387
01:22:46,110 --> 01:22:47,180
Play a game.

2388
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:48,849
What game?

2389
01:22:48,850 --> 01:22:50,049
Let's have them play the same game while I photograph them...

2390
01:22:50,050 --> 01:22:51,319
- in a blindfold. - Let's do that.

2391
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,950
(Let's do that.)

2392
01:22:53,480 --> 01:22:54,920
- Let's begin. - Okay.

2393
01:22:55,150 --> 01:22:56,989
We'll be at either end.

2394
01:22:56,990 --> 01:22:58,860
(It's Tae Hyun versus Seung Ho for escape.)

2395
01:22:59,090 --> 01:23:01,329
Let's begin. Get ready. Set, go.

2396
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:02,529
Think of their tendencies.

2397
01:23:02,530 --> 01:23:03,660
(Let's get down!)

2398
01:23:04,430 --> 01:23:07,659
There you go.

2399
01:23:07,660 --> 01:23:08,969
If you grab the body,

2400
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:10,100
you'll know where they're at.

2401
01:23:11,670 --> 01:23:13,539
There you go.

2402
01:23:13,540 --> 01:23:15,640
(He presses the shutter nonstop upon figuring out the location.)

2403
01:23:16,310 --> 01:23:17,510
- Stop. - Okay.

2404
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:22,950
- Seung Ho caught me. - It's hot.

2405
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:24,980
- It's hot. - Let's see the photos.

2406
01:23:25,450 --> 01:23:26,719
(Laughing)

2407
01:23:26,720 --> 01:23:27,990
Look at the two of them.

2408
01:23:28,220 --> 01:23:29,290
What's this?

2409
01:23:29,550 --> 01:23:30,820
Whose face is showing?

2410
01:23:30,950 --> 01:23:33,359
Only Tae Hyun's face isn't showing.

2411
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,429
- This is Seung Ho's photo. - Seung Ho, one.

2412
01:23:35,430 --> 01:23:36,529
- Okay. - Seung Ho, one.

2413
01:23:36,530 --> 01:23:37,559
Seung Ho.

2414
01:23:37,560 --> 01:23:39,499
- His face is showing. - Okay. Two.

2415
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:40,600
Seung Ho, two.

2416
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,730
Seung Ho, three.

2417
01:23:43,530 --> 01:23:44,940
He thought he didn't get photographed.

2418
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:47,000
Did the two of you fight?

2419
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,340
Seung Ho looks like he's having a UFC match.

2420
01:23:49,940 --> 01:23:51,640
- It doesn't count. - Next.

2421
01:23:52,710 --> 01:23:53,939
Both of them.

2422
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:55,209
- Both of them. - Okay.

2423
01:23:55,210 --> 01:23:56,510
One for both of them.

2424
01:23:56,950 --> 01:23:58,349
- Tae Hyun? - It should count.

2425
01:23:58,350 --> 01:23:59,850
- Tae Hyun, one. - It should count.

2426
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:02,549
- Tae Hyun. - Okay. He's in the photo.

2427
01:24:02,550 --> 01:24:04,190
One, two, three.

2428
01:24:05,020 --> 01:24:06,289
- Tae Hyun, one. - Okay.

2429
01:24:06,290 --> 01:24:08,030
- It's 4 to 3. - It's 4 to 3.

2430
01:24:08,630 --> 01:24:10,190
- It counts. - It counts.

2431
01:24:10,290 --> 01:24:11,430
- For both of them, right? - Yes.

2432
01:24:11,500 --> 01:24:13,230
- Okay. - Both of them.

2433
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:14,400
Okay. It's 5 to 4.

2434
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:15,930
It's Seung Ho,

2435
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:17,300
- Seung Ho. - Okay.

2436
01:24:17,730 --> 01:24:18,740
Okay.

2437
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,469
One for Tae Hyun.

2438
01:24:20,470 --> 01:24:21,539
It's 6 to 5.

2439
01:24:21,540 --> 01:24:22,869
(Seung Ho: 6, Tae Hyun: 5)

2440
01:24:22,870 --> 01:24:24,069
- The end. - No.

2441
01:24:24,070 --> 01:24:25,140
- It's the end. - Is it the end?

2442
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:26,580
(Final result, Seung Ho: 6 versus Tae Hyun: 5)

2443
01:24:26,710 --> 01:24:28,380
Tae Hyun, you can escape right away.

2444
01:24:28,710 --> 01:24:31,380
Let's play the next game.

2445
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:34,249
(I'm jealous.)

2446
01:24:34,250 --> 01:24:35,349
In such a situation,

2447
01:24:35,350 --> 01:24:37,050
being short has an advantage.

2448
01:24:37,650 --> 01:24:38,720
Let's go.

2449
01:24:41,390 --> 01:24:43,890
(Welcome to paradise.)

2450
01:24:44,430 --> 01:24:47,060
(He can't help but exclaim.)

2451
01:24:47,400 --> 01:24:49,900
(In any case, I escaped.)

2452
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:51,300
It's cold.

2453
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:54,670
(He enjoys a cold drink.)

2454
01:24:57,310 --> 01:25:01,240
(While he enjoys the coolness by himself,)

2455
01:25:01,580 --> 01:25:04,380
(the remaining members struggle with the intense heat.)

2456
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:07,180
(The unbearable heat...)

2457
01:25:07,650 --> 01:25:09,890
(makes them sweat buckets.)

2458
01:25:10,420 --> 01:25:11,490
Look at my sweat.

2459
01:25:11,979 --> 01:25:13,739
The second game for escape is...

2460
01:25:14,860 --> 01:25:16,159
Endure the Pickax.

2461
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,460
What's that?

2462
01:25:17,890 --> 01:25:19,659
- The thigh. - You'll have a 1-on-1 match.

2463
01:25:19,660 --> 01:25:22,029
With your elbow, you'll press on the opponent's thigh.

2464
01:25:22,030 --> 01:25:24,570
The person who screams first will be the loser.

2465
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:27,040
The last survivor will escape.

2466
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:29,940
To be honest, Sang Uk and Dong Hyun should have a match.

2467
01:25:30,070 --> 01:25:31,479
Okay. I'll take him on.

2468
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:32,580
(Everyone looks forward to their match.)

2469
01:25:33,340 --> 01:25:34,410
- All right. - We'll begin on your mark.

2470
01:25:34,950 --> 01:25:36,280
Let's begin.

2471
01:25:36,480 --> 01:25:38,519
- One... - I'm extremely ticklish.

2472
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:41,449
Get ready. Set, go.

2473
01:25:41,450 --> 01:25:42,450
(Screaming)

2474
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:45,590
(He screamed in 1 second.)

2475
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:47,390
He couldn't endure it at all.

2476
01:25:48,030 --> 01:25:49,329
I might be a bit slippery.

2477
01:25:49,330 --> 01:25:50,690
I sweated a lot.

2478
01:25:51,090 --> 01:25:55,570
(Sang Uk is number 1 in the world when it comes to leg muscles.)

2479
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:57,270
We go home like this.

2480
01:25:57,870 --> 01:26:00,800
(He has strong leg muscles from UFC.)

2481
01:26:01,100 --> 01:26:03,110
(It's easy!)

2482
01:26:04,510 --> 01:26:05,879
(Between the two members with the strongest leg muscles,)

2483
01:26:05,880 --> 01:26:07,339
(who will take the throne?)

2484
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:08,909
- It's over if you make a sound. - You can't make a sound.

2485
01:26:08,910 --> 01:26:10,010
I'll do this.

2486
01:26:10,650 --> 01:26:11,780
What do we do with our hands?

2487
01:26:11,850 --> 01:26:12,879
What do we do with our hands?

2488
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,279
(There's tension in the air.)

2489
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:15,919
- Shall we begin? - I'll move my leg.

2490
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,449
(The combat pose)

2491
01:26:17,450 --> 01:26:18,590
Let's begin.

2492
01:26:18,990 --> 01:26:20,060
It's the final.

2493
01:26:20,260 --> 01:26:21,630
It's like a struggle for the satba.

2494
01:26:21,660 --> 01:26:23,690
Get ready. Set, go.

2495
01:26:24,030 --> 01:26:26,430
Get ready. Set, go.

2496
01:26:27,630 --> 01:26:28,730
(Sputtering)

2497
01:26:29,330 --> 01:26:32,170
(Endurance)

2498
01:26:33,270 --> 01:26:34,270
(Crying)

2499
01:26:34,271 --> 01:26:35,310
Dong Hyun won.

2500
01:26:35,570 --> 01:26:37,510
Dong Hyun has an advantage.

2501
01:26:37,710 --> 01:26:40,080
- He took hits all his life. - I mean...

2502
01:26:41,110 --> 01:26:42,249
I can endure kicks.

2503
01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:43,280
Seung Ho and me.

2504
01:26:43,450 --> 01:26:45,080
(Laughing)

2505
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:47,750
(This is so much fun.)

2506
01:26:48,120 --> 01:26:50,250
It'll be Dong Hyun that will come out 100 percent.

2507
01:26:53,420 --> 01:26:54,760
- There's no choice. - He's different.

2508
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:56,229
- There's no choice. - Why are you... Gosh.

2509
01:26:56,230 --> 01:26:58,029
You don't just press anywhere. There's a certain spot.

2510
01:26:58,030 --> 01:26:59,799
You can feel a certain spot.

2511
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:00,929
- A certain spot? - Right.

2512
01:27:00,930 --> 01:27:02,729
How can you bring a professional?

2513
01:27:02,730 --> 01:27:04,769
- We're no match. - I'll go easy on you.

2514
01:27:04,770 --> 01:27:05,840
Don't do it!

2515
01:27:05,900 --> 01:27:07,169
- Gosh. - Yi Kyung.

2516
01:27:07,170 --> 01:27:08,409
Press against him...

2517
01:27:08,410 --> 01:27:09,410
with all that you've got.

2518
01:27:09,411 --> 01:27:10,739
- We'll start. - I'm going to...

2519
01:27:10,740 --> 01:27:12,179
- get destroyed. - You should be on top.

2520
01:27:12,180 --> 01:27:13,739
- Right. - You should be on top.

2521
01:27:13,740 --> 01:27:14,740
Gosh, that was hot.

2522
01:27:15,550 --> 01:27:17,850
We'll start. Get ready and go.

2523
01:27:18,220 --> 01:27:19,820
Get ready and go.

2524
01:27:21,490 --> 01:27:22,890
He's doing well.

2525
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:25,789
- Hold on. Time out. - I have nowhere to press.

2526
01:27:25,790 --> 01:27:27,159
Time out. You can't move back your thigh.

2527
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:28,689
Why move back your thigh?

2528
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:30,159
- It was a skill. - You have to give him your thigh.

2529
01:27:30,160 --> 01:27:31,430
You have to give me your thigh.

2530
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:33,060
Hurry up and give it to me.

2531
01:27:33,860 --> 01:27:34,929
That's so scary.

2532
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:35,999
He told me to hurry up and give him my thigh.

2533
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,000
Hurry up and give it to me.

2534
01:27:37,001 --> 01:27:38,440
- You keep running away. - Hold on.

2535
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,440
It feels like my ankle bone is about to burn.

2536
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:42,510
I'll just cover this foot.

2537
01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:44,210
You understand why, right?

2538
01:27:44,340 --> 01:27:45,910
It will be over before your ankle bone burns.

2539
01:27:46,310 --> 01:27:47,740
Aren't those arm sleeves though?

2540
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:49,479
You have to give me your thigh.

2541
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:51,079
- You have to give me your thigh. - Aren't those arm sleeves?

2542
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:52,420
You can't move away your thigh.

2543
01:27:52,520 --> 01:27:53,819
You'll lose if you move it away.

2544
01:27:53,820 --> 01:27:55,520
Get ready and go.

2545
01:27:56,390 --> 01:27:57,749
You'll lose if you move it away.

2546
01:27:57,750 --> 01:27:59,360
Get ready and go.

2547
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:02,059
I didn't even press down.

2548
01:28:02,060 --> 01:28:03,830
It ended before I pressed down.

2549
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:05,559
- It's over. - Yi Kyung loses.

2550
01:28:05,560 --> 01:28:07,259
Okay! Gosh, my skin is peeling off.

2551
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:08,699
Hurry up and leave. I'll clean it up with a wet wipe.

2552
01:28:08,700 --> 01:28:10,770
Kim Dong Hyun wins in the final.

2553
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:12,669
- Bye! - You may escape.

2554
01:28:12,670 --> 01:28:13,700
Okay.

2555
01:28:14,170 --> 01:28:16,040
That was a professional.

2556
01:28:16,670 --> 01:28:18,069
(Welcome to paradise.)

2557
01:28:18,070 --> 01:28:20,679
This is unfair.

2558
01:28:20,680 --> 01:28:21,909
- Why? - Well,

2559
01:28:21,910 --> 01:28:24,149
I could've died if I were there.

2560
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:25,150
Right. Great job.

2561
01:28:25,151 --> 01:28:27,279
I was fortunate to escape right away.

2562
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:28,549
(This feels great.)

2563
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:29,550
(Screaming)

2564
01:28:30,250 --> 01:28:32,360
(The chilliness could be felt through the ends of his feet.)

2565
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,819
(Screaming)

2566
01:28:33,820 --> 01:28:35,490
- It's too cold! - It's too cold.

2567
01:28:36,530 --> 01:28:38,129
- It's too cold to put my feet in. - Right.

2568
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:39,499
- It's too cold. - Hold on.

2569
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:42,029
- Gosh. - I'll go and tell them about it.

2570
01:28:42,030 --> 01:28:43,370
It's so cold.

2571
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:48,140
- That was a professional. - Hold up.

2572
01:28:48,810 --> 01:28:50,540
The water is too cold that I can't put my feet in.

2573
01:28:50,940 --> 01:28:52,509
Please make it less cold next time.

2574
01:28:52,510 --> 01:28:53,910
The water is too cold.

2575
01:28:54,010 --> 01:28:55,350
I can't put my feet in!

2576
01:28:55,450 --> 01:28:57,050
You should've put in a decent amount of ice!

2577
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:00,720
(Boiling up)

2578
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:03,990
Gosh. What's the next game?

2579
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:06,660
This is the third escape game.

2580
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:09,090
It's Elephant Trunk, Cushion Steal.

2581
01:29:09,530 --> 01:29:11,360
What is Elephant Trunk, Cushion Steal?

2582
01:29:11,530 --> 01:29:12,599
- All right, everyone. - What is that?

2583
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:13,900
There's a cushion in front of you.

2584
01:29:14,230 --> 01:29:17,829
Please stand around it.

2585
01:29:17,830 --> 01:29:21,099
After doing 15 elephant trunk spins where you are standing,

2586
01:29:21,100 --> 01:29:23,810
the first person to sit on the cushion wins.

2587
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:27,140
Here we go.

2588
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:28,909
- Let's watch out with our arms. - Right.

2589
01:29:28,910 --> 01:29:29,979
(They all make elephant trunks.)

2590
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:32,850
Duck down a bit. One, two, and go.

2591
01:29:33,220 --> 01:29:34,420
One, two, and go.

2592
01:29:34,620 --> 01:29:38,390
One, two, three, four, five,

2593
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,589
- Seven. - Six.

2594
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:41,160
(Spinning swiftly)

2595
01:29:41,830 --> 01:29:44,190
(Spinning slowly)

2596
01:29:44,290 --> 01:29:46,359
Eight, nine, ten...

2597
01:29:46,360 --> 01:29:48,230
(It looks like it's a battle between Yi Kyung and Seung Ho.)

2598
01:29:48,470 --> 01:29:50,399
Ten, eleven, twelve...

2599
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:52,169
(Who will take the cushion first?)

2600
01:29:52,170 --> 01:29:53,740
Fourteen, fifteen.

2601
01:29:54,770 --> 01:29:55,810
Fifteen!

2602
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:57,910
(Fifteen!)

2603
01:29:58,280 --> 01:30:00,080
(Sitting!)

2604
01:30:00,910 --> 01:30:02,479
(Falling over)

2605
01:30:02,480 --> 01:30:03,950
Gosh, that's hot.

2606
01:30:04,510 --> 01:30:06,649
(Stumbling)

2607
01:30:06,650 --> 01:30:08,150
(Gosh, that's hot!)

2608
01:30:09,150 --> 01:30:10,749
(The ground is calling for me.)

2609
01:30:10,750 --> 01:30:12,619
Hold on.

2610
01:30:12,620 --> 01:30:13,690
Gosh, I feel dizzy.

2611
01:30:15,060 --> 01:30:17,090
- Gosh. - Where am I?

2612
01:30:18,190 --> 01:30:19,360
Where am I?

2613
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:21,159
The world is spinning around in this direction.

2614
01:30:21,160 --> 01:30:22,429
(The world keeps spinning.)

2615
01:30:22,430 --> 01:30:23,970
Keep your eyes closed.

2616
01:30:25,270 --> 01:30:26,369
(It's burning.)

2617
01:30:26,370 --> 01:30:28,740
(The firewood keeps burning.)

2618
01:30:29,540 --> 01:30:33,640
(Their energy gets drained from the heated floor.)

2619
01:30:35,380 --> 01:30:37,409
- Gosh, hold on. - Did he do all the spins?

2620
01:30:37,410 --> 01:30:38,850
- Did he do all 15 spins? - The world is spinning.

2621
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:40,012
He did all of them.

2622
01:30:40,850 --> 01:30:42,490
He did all of them while I was still doing seven?

2623
01:30:42,950 --> 01:30:44,890
Hurry up and leave! Conbrats.

2624
01:30:45,290 --> 01:30:47,590
- "Conbrats?" - I meant to say, "Congrats."

2625
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:49,559
- Thank you for "conbratulating" me. - I can't believe it.

2626
01:30:49,560 --> 01:30:50,426
How were you so fast?

2627
01:30:50,716 --> 01:30:51,526
He was so fast.

2628
01:30:54,300 --> 01:30:56,069
(Paradise after victory)

2629
01:30:56,070 --> 01:30:57,130
(Screaming)

2630
01:30:57,830 --> 01:30:58,899
(Seung Ho comes out while spurting out the heat.)

2631
01:30:58,900 --> 01:31:00,800
Hey, the water is really cold. Try feeling it.

2632
01:31:01,070 --> 01:31:03,110
(Screaming)

2633
01:31:04,470 --> 01:31:06,210
(Laughing)

2634
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:08,209
He's unrivaled.

2635
01:31:08,210 --> 01:31:09,349
(An unrivaled shout of the escapee)

2636
01:31:09,350 --> 01:31:10,950
I have to dip my feet in.

2637
01:31:11,180 --> 01:31:12,820
- It's really cold. - You won't be able to.

2638
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,920
- Seriously. - I do this often.

2639
01:31:15,020 --> 01:31:16,349
You won't be able to handle it.

2640
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:18,360
I have to cool down my ankles.

2641
01:31:18,690 --> 01:31:19,760
It's... Gosh!

2642
01:31:20,020 --> 01:31:21,359
(He still isn't used to the water.)

2643
01:31:21,360 --> 01:31:23,330
- I can't put my feet in! - It's too cold.

2644
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:24,929
- Can you keep your feet in? - Gosh!

2645
01:31:24,930 --> 01:31:25,999
(He puts his feet in the ice water.)

2646
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,159
After this game... Gosh, it's cold!

2647
01:31:27,160 --> 01:31:28,230
(Groaning)

2648
01:31:28,330 --> 01:31:30,100
If I endure through it,

2649
01:31:30,770 --> 01:31:32,000
my feet will get used to it.

2650
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:33,539
How can you endure through this?

2651
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:34,599
This feels more like a penalty.

2652
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,210
(Screaming)

2653
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:38,680
Gosh, my feet hurt!

2654
01:31:39,110 --> 01:31:40,740
The ice is too cold.

2655
01:31:41,580 --> 01:31:42,680
My feet are hot.

2656
01:31:43,650 --> 01:31:44,749
Gosh.

2657
01:31:44,750 --> 01:31:47,450
(His feet are drenched in sweat.)

2658
01:31:49,250 --> 01:31:50,920
Gosh, my feet are hot.

2659
01:31:51,190 --> 01:31:52,460
You're doing okay, right?

2660
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:54,620
- Did you ask if we're doing okay? - Yes.

2661
01:31:55,330 --> 01:31:56,390
Well,

2662
01:31:57,290 --> 01:31:58,559
what do we do now?

2663
01:31:58,560 --> 01:32:00,460
We've prepared some eggs for you...

2664
01:32:00,800 --> 01:32:02,470
that are eaten often at saunas.

2665
01:32:02,830 --> 01:32:04,170
This is the last escape game.

2666
01:32:04,730 --> 01:32:06,939
It's Raw Egg Versus Boiled Egg.

2667
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:08,140
It's a game of luck.

2668
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:09,909
- A game of luck sounds nice. - Okay.

2669
01:32:09,910 --> 01:32:11,780
- Sang Uk will have a better chance. - We'll set it up.

2670
01:32:12,540 --> 01:32:14,139
Each egg will be picked? Gosh, that's hot!

2671
01:32:14,140 --> 01:32:16,049
Then what will count?

2672
01:32:16,050 --> 01:32:17,279
Is the raw egg the bad pick?

2673
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,079
Excuse me. Has anyone ordered some ice?

2674
01:32:19,080 --> 01:32:20,550
- No. That's not us. - No?

2675
01:32:20,980 --> 01:32:22,089
- Will you be okay without it? - I'll be out soon.

2676
01:32:22,090 --> 01:32:23,649
- We just have too much ice. - I'll be out soon.

2677
01:32:23,650 --> 01:32:25,359
It will be shared for free. Will you be okay without it?

2678
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:26,559
I'll be out soon.

2679
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:27,759
(Get out!)

2680
01:32:27,760 --> 01:32:29,959
Gosh, the heat is coming out through the door.

2681
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:31,090
I'll close the door for you.

2682
01:32:32,560 --> 01:32:33,759
Why did I lose to him?

2683
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,729
The raw egg is the bad pick, right?

2684
01:32:35,730 --> 01:32:37,569
Half of the eggs are raw.

2685
01:32:37,570 --> 01:32:39,500
- Half? - The other half are boiled eggs.

2686
01:32:39,800 --> 01:32:41,769
The one that picks the boiled egg will win...

2687
01:32:41,770 --> 01:32:42,940
and escape right away.

2688
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:45,140
- Shall we pick one for each other? - Okay.

2689
01:32:48,110 --> 01:32:49,310
You should go with number 17.

2690
01:32:49,950 --> 01:32:52,850
(Sang Uk's egg)

2691
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:54,919
Can I make a deal with you?

2692
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:56,019
What kind of deal?

2693
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,620
I'll start from here. Why don't you start from here?

2694
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:01,460
- We'll test our luck? - Right.

2695
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:03,660
(Thinking)

2696
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:04,890
You should go with number 17.

2697
01:33:05,530 --> 01:33:08,229
(His offer for a deal went nowhere.)

2698
01:33:08,230 --> 01:33:09,230
What about me?

2699
01:33:09,231 --> 01:33:10,270
(Which egg will Yi Kyung get?)

2700
01:33:10,500 --> 01:33:11,629
- You? - Yes.

2701
01:33:11,630 --> 01:33:12,899
(Thinking carefully)

2702
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:14,439
- You should go with number 24. - Number 24?

2703
01:33:14,440 --> 01:33:15,640
You should go with number 16.

2704
01:33:16,140 --> 01:33:17,439
You get number 16. I get number 24.

2705
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,210
- Okay. - Let's carefully pick them up.

2706
01:33:20,310 --> 01:33:21,949
(They pick up the eggs that they have picked for each other.)

2707
01:33:21,950 --> 01:33:23,680
All right. We'll start right away.

2708
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:27,219
(Who will be the lucky one to become the last escapee?)

2709
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:28,320
We'll start right away.

2710
01:33:29,050 --> 01:33:30,390
One, two, three!

2711
01:33:33,060 --> 01:33:34,120
Three!

2712
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:36,259
(Laughing)

2713
01:33:36,260 --> 01:33:37,290
Two, three!

2714
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:41,700
(Unlucky)

2715
01:33:43,430 --> 01:33:45,839
(Yi Kyung was given a boiled egg.)

2716
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,600
(Yi Kyung escapes.)

2717
01:33:48,440 --> 01:33:51,370
(Feeling bitter)

2718
01:33:51,640 --> 01:33:54,310
How can I lose again with this one?

2719
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:57,880
(He checks number 17 as well.)

2720
01:33:58,620 --> 01:34:00,480
(No luck!)

2721
01:34:01,650 --> 01:34:02,719
My gosh!

2722
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:05,490
(It's your fate to stay in the yellow clay sauna.)

2723
01:34:06,760 --> 01:34:07,760
(Chuckling)
Is it over?

2724
01:34:08,761 --> 01:34:10,459
(Laughing)

2725
01:34:10,460 --> 01:34:12,530
- Gosh, Sang Uk. - Poor Sang Uk.

2726
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:15,300
(Paradise of joy)

2727
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:17,700
What game did you play?

2728
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:20,640
- What game did you play? - Sang Uk makes me so happy.

2729
01:34:20,675 --> 01:34:21,471
What game did you play?

2730
01:34:21,910 --> 01:34:23,209
It was a game of luck with eggs.

2731
01:34:23,210 --> 01:34:25,069
Right. You each picked an egg?

2732
01:34:25,070 --> 01:34:26,439
He got the raw egg right away.

2733
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:28,480
Right away? How did that happen?

2734
01:34:28,580 --> 01:34:29,950
This is so embarrassing.

2735
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:33,520
Why is Sang Uk so unlucky?

2736
01:34:34,263 --> 01:34:35,763
What is he doing on his own?

2737
01:34:38,290 --> 01:34:39,620
What's my penalty then?

2738
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:41,220
You are left alone now.

2739
01:34:43,390 --> 01:34:44,390
All right.

2740
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:50,030
This is the last mission.

2741
01:34:51,800 --> 01:34:53,100
We got this since it was really hot.

2742
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,240
You may escape...

2743
01:34:55,610 --> 01:34:57,970
after putting together the igloo in front of you.

2744
01:34:57,995 --> 01:34:58,919
Are you serious?

2745
01:35:01,110 --> 01:35:04,680
(Penalty: Put together the igloo before you escape.)

2746
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:07,319
(He reads the instructions first.)

2747
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:08,350
Let's see.

2748
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:10,928
Okay. This is it.

2749
01:35:11,490 --> 01:35:12,990
- What is that? - Is that a puzzle?

2750
01:35:13,146 --> 01:35:13,648
Gosh!

2751
01:35:14,260 --> 01:35:16,290
- I'm great at that. - He has to complete it.

2752
01:35:16,430 --> 01:35:18,329
We're professionals.

2753
01:35:18,330 --> 01:35:19,829
- We're professionals with that. - Right.

2754
01:35:19,830 --> 01:35:21,130
We're professionals.

2755
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:23,130
(Digging through)

2756
01:35:23,500 --> 01:35:25,000
The base is missing.

2757
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:26,510
Is this it?

2758
01:35:27,340 --> 01:35:28,770
(Comparing with the picture)

2759
01:35:29,310 --> 01:35:30,409
This isn't it.

2760
01:35:30,410 --> 01:35:33,740
(The beginner with blocks is already stuck at the start.)

2761
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:38,920
Gosh, I'm a professional at this.

2762
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:40,680
Where is it? Which one is it?

2763
01:35:40,880 --> 01:35:42,350
- This one. - I'm a professional.

2764
01:35:42,520 --> 01:35:43,720
I'll help you.

2765
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:45,690
I'm a person who has been to their headquarters.

2766
01:35:46,590 --> 01:35:47,920
You should open up, number three, Sang Uk.

2767
01:35:48,090 --> 01:35:49,289
But we're making this one.

2768
01:35:49,290 --> 01:35:51,789
This is how it's done, Sang Uk!

2769
01:35:51,790 --> 01:35:52,929
- Right. - Really?

2770
01:35:52,930 --> 01:35:55,000
- No wonder it was missing. - Isn't it better to do it alone?

2771
01:35:55,370 --> 01:35:56,670
There are too many cooks, aren't there?

2772
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,029
- Sang Uk. - Right.

2773
01:35:58,030 --> 01:35:59,699
You know how you can't complete it with just one missing piece, right?

2774
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:00,939
I'll do it!

2775
01:36:00,940 --> 01:36:02,169
(Laughing)

2776
01:36:02,170 --> 01:36:03,270
One person should...

2777
01:36:04,110 --> 01:36:06,539
(The eventful block building's full version...)

2778
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:09,110
(will be released online.)

2779
01:36:09,780 --> 01:36:11,080
We're almost done.

2780
01:36:12,150 --> 01:36:13,379
The door will be placed now!

2781
01:36:13,380 --> 01:36:14,920
- Here. - We're almost done.

2782
01:36:15,020 --> 01:36:17,020
This isn't needed.

2783
01:36:17,450 --> 01:36:18,489
Gosh, it's so hot.

2784
01:36:18,490 --> 01:36:19,919
It feels great to see it fit perfectly.

2785
01:36:19,920 --> 01:36:21,259
- Right. - This is the fun of it.

2786
01:36:21,260 --> 01:36:22,260
This one.

2787
01:36:22,261 --> 01:36:24,660
This goes right here.

2788
01:36:25,260 --> 01:36:26,700
- We're done. - This one.

2789
01:36:27,660 --> 01:36:29,570
- It's Sang Uk. - Open it up in a sexy way.

2790
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:35,269
(Filled with Sang Uk's tenacity and sweat)

2791
01:36:35,270 --> 01:36:37,239
Right. You made it!

2792
01:36:37,240 --> 01:36:38,680
- Let's go! - Let's go!

2793
01:36:39,410 --> 01:36:41,909
Let's get out, Sang Uk. Go into the ice water.

2794
01:36:41,910 --> 01:36:43,180
I'm about to collapse.

2795
01:36:44,280 --> 01:36:45,280
Here we go.

2796
01:36:46,680 --> 01:36:48,549
- Go in there, Sang Uk. - I want to go in there.

2797
01:36:48,550 --> 01:36:50,249
(He moves himself to the cold water.)

2798
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:51,350
I won't be able to go in.

2799
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:54,790
(He has finally found his oasis.)

2800
01:36:55,590 --> 01:36:56,660
(Feeling refreshed)

2801
01:36:58,960 --> 01:37:02,169
(He dives into the cold water.)

2802
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:03,730
- Where is he? He went in? - Gosh, it's refreshing.

2803
01:37:06,400 --> 01:37:08,340
- It's colder than ice. - Ice was put in.

2804
01:37:09,610 --> 01:37:10,740
This was a great retreat.

2805
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:12,480
- I'll sleep really well at home. - This is amazing.

2806
01:37:12,740 --> 01:37:14,440
- Let's make a toast, Dong Hyun. - Okay.

2807
01:37:15,140 --> 01:37:17,850
- A retreat in shortage. - It was a life in shortage.

2808
01:37:17,980 --> 01:37:19,979
It was great to see all of us...

2809
01:37:19,980 --> 01:37:22,349
- cooperate toward the end. - Right.

2810
01:37:22,350 --> 01:37:25,250
- Great work. - Great work.

2811
01:37:25,960 --> 01:37:27,532
Turn off your phones next week.

2812
01:37:28,268 --> 01:37:29,146
Let's not contact each other.

2813
01:37:29,790 --> 01:37:30,726
Great work, everyone.

2814
01:37:30,751 --> 01:37:31,981
(What kind of shortage will wait for them next time?)

2815
01:37:33,603 --> 01:37:36,072
(The Handsome Guys make a great appearance in suits.)

2816
01:37:36,073 --> 01:37:38,903
(There seems to be no shortage today.)

2817
01:37:39,203 --> 01:37:40,673
(Shortage in Fashion)

2818
01:37:40,843 --> 01:37:42,973
(Spring and summer collection of the Handsome Guys)

2819
01:37:43,143 --> 01:37:44,613
(Getting angry)

2820
01:37:45,913 --> 01:37:47,283
(Is this the last episode?)

2821
01:37:47,443 --> 01:37:48,882
(You shouldn't have...)

2822
01:37:48,883 --> 01:37:50,483
(told us to get dressed like this.)

2823
01:37:50,913 --> 01:37:52,423
(This is underwear.)

2824
01:37:53,523 --> 01:37:54,752
(Censored)

2825
01:37:54,753 --> 01:37:56,223
(Cheering)

2826
01:37:57,753 --> 01:37:59,092
(Style out)

2827
01:37:59,093 --> 01:38:00,562
(Shortage in)

2828
01:38:00,563 --> 01:38:02,793
(A special schedule for the Handsome Guys)

2829
01:38:02,963 --> 01:38:05,763
(Marketing meeting, reform meeting, fan sign event, club activity)

2830
01:38:05,903 --> 01:38:07,432
(There will be more than 10,000 pictures of us taken.)

2831
01:38:07,433 --> 01:38:09,133
(It's okay if we're together.)

2832
01:38:09,403 --> 01:38:10,672
(It's Cha Tae Hyun!)

2833
01:38:10,673 --> 01:38:11,803
(It's not!)

2834
01:38:12,103 --> 01:38:15,073
(It will be embarrassing even when you are together.)

2835
01:38:15,573 --> 01:38:17,573
(Gosh, this is embarrassing.)

2836
01:38:17,973 --> 01:38:19,513
(Running)

2837
01:38:19,983 --> 01:38:21,843
(It will be embarrassing even when you run.)

2838
01:38:22,140 --> 01:38:23,304
Don't look.

2839
01:38:24,983 --> 01:38:27,253
(Don't look.)

2840
01:38:27,353 --> 01:38:29,123
(Scanning)

2841
01:38:29,393 --> 01:38:30,853
(Shocked)

2842
01:38:31,323 --> 01:38:33,123
(Covering her mouth)

2843
01:38:33,293 --> 01:38:35,562
(It will be embarrassing even when time goes by.)

2844
01:38:35,563 --> 01:38:37,863
(You will be given clothes if you win in the games.)

2845
01:38:38,063 --> 01:38:40,463
(Let's escape the shortage.)

2846
01:38:40,533 --> 01:38:43,233
(Doing his best)

2847
01:38:43,933 --> 01:38:45,173
(An intense competition full of embarrassment)

2848
01:38:45,303 --> 01:38:48,503
(Dong Hyun tears his pants.)

2849
01:38:48,843 --> 01:38:50,543
(What is this?)

2850
01:38:50,813 --> 01:38:52,683
(The crazy Handsome Guys party is open.)

2851
01:38:53,113 --> 01:38:54,883
(Collapsing from laughter)

2852
01:38:55,343 --> 01:38:57,983
(Will the Handsome Guys be able to regain their dignity?)
