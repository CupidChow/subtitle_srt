1
00:00:29,556 --> 00:00:33,496
(The season when the wind is soft)

2
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:38,235
- Hello.
- Hello.

3
00:00:38,236 --> 00:00:39,266
Hello.

4
00:00:40,776 --> 00:00:42,205
The weather is nice today.

5
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:43,652
(A campsite in Yangpyeong, Gyeonggi Province)

6
00:00:43,676 --> 00:00:44,945
As you can see based on the location,

7
00:00:44,946 --> 00:00:47,415
we're going to camp today.

8
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:48,416
- What?
- Gosh.

9
00:00:48,417 --> 00:00:49,616
I like camping.

10
00:00:51,486 --> 00:00:53,185
(Considering the inconvenience caused by filming, )

11
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,985
(we reserved the entire campsite...)

12
00:00:54,986 --> 00:00:56,955
(on the day without bookings.)

13
00:00:56,956 --> 00:00:58,085
Do you like to camp?

14
00:00:58,086 --> 00:00:59,855
There's an emotional vibe to camping.

15
00:00:59,856 --> 00:01:01,455
- Do you like camping?
- I love it.

16
00:01:01,456 --> 00:01:03,196
I've never done it, and I hate it.

17
00:01:03,896 --> 00:01:05,065
When do we have time...

18
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:06,935
to set up everything and clean it all up?

19
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:08,495
I'm an expert, so don't worry.

20
00:01:08,496 --> 00:01:10,305
Really?

21
00:01:10,306 --> 00:01:12,106
- That's nice.
- It'd be my first time today.

22
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:14,705
But I'm an expert.

23
00:01:14,706 --> 00:01:18,476
When I was a child, I went camping a lot with my family.

24
00:01:18,776 --> 00:01:20,075
My father set up everything.

25
00:01:20,076 --> 00:01:22,375
We listened to the sound of the rain inside the tent.

26
00:01:22,376 --> 00:01:24,345
- Right.
- That's really nice.

27
00:01:24,346 --> 00:01:26,022
It's nice when someone sets it up for you.

28
00:01:26,046 --> 00:01:27,115
I have many good memories of it.

29
00:01:27,116 --> 00:01:28,715
- Your father took you to camp.
- Yes.

30
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:31,186
You must have learned about camping from your father.

31
00:01:31,456 --> 00:01:32,825
Instead of camping with your children,

32
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,225
all you do is travel abroad.

33
00:01:34,226 --> 00:01:36,025
I don't travel abroad alone.

34
00:01:36,026 --> 00:01:37,465
- Why do you do that?
- I go with my family.

35
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:40,465
Dong Hyun loves our show so much...

36
00:01:40,466 --> 00:01:41,995
that he applied the theme to his family.

37
00:01:41,996 --> 00:01:43,865
- The theme is shortage in father.
- I lack as a father.

38
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:46,975
I'm learning how to be a father.

39
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:48,136
A father with shortcomings.

40
00:01:48,536 --> 00:01:50,105
I lack as a father. I'm learning.

41
00:01:50,106 --> 00:01:51,245
(Joking)

42
00:01:51,246 --> 00:01:52,875
- By the way, - Camping.

43
00:01:52,876 --> 00:01:54,545
Is there any shortage in camping?

44
00:01:54,546 --> 00:01:55,945
- I mean...
- Please take a guess.

45
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:58,316
It won't be shortage in something that we've already done.

46
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:00,655
- We've had shortage in water, - Of course.

47
00:02:00,656 --> 00:02:02,656
- so luckily, it can't be that.
- That's a relief.

48
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,385
It could be a shortage in fire.

49
00:02:04,386 --> 00:02:06,896
Maybe we have to start a fire ourselves.

50
00:02:07,226 --> 00:02:08,525
You're right. That's possible.

51
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:10,246
- I won't be able to start a fire.
- Right.

52
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:12,226
It's impossible for me...

53
00:02:12,596 --> 00:02:14,136
to start a fire.

54
00:02:14,496 --> 00:02:16,596
I've tried it for 17 hours, but I couldn't do it.

55
00:02:16,736 --> 00:02:18,305
- Doesn't this work?
- Never.

56
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,306
- You know what?
- What's that?

57
00:02:19,307 --> 00:02:20,635
- I tried it for over 17 hours.
- Or with rocks.

58
00:02:20,636 --> 00:02:21,935
- The fire didn't start.
- What about with branches?

59
00:02:21,936 --> 00:02:22,936
The fire didn't start.

60
00:02:22,937 --> 00:02:24,546
It won't be shortage in tent, will it?

61
00:02:24,746 --> 00:02:25,775
"Tent?"

62
00:02:25,776 --> 00:02:27,546
- Shortage in home.
- Shortage in home?

63
00:02:27,746 --> 00:02:29,315
(That's possible.)

64
00:02:29,316 --> 00:02:32,046
What kind of shortage will there be today?

65
00:02:32,546 --> 00:02:33,686
Today,

66
00:02:34,316 --> 00:02:35,556
on the campsite,

67
00:02:35,786 --> 00:02:37,656
- there will be Shortage in Privacy.
- What?

68
00:02:38,286 --> 00:02:39,555
(Shortage in Privacy?)

69
00:02:39,556 --> 00:02:40,656
Privacy?

70
00:02:41,096 --> 00:02:43,225
- Put aside individualism today...
- No.

71
00:02:43,226 --> 00:02:45,566
And try to strengthen your relationships.

72
00:02:47,566 --> 00:02:49,966
- We will tie your arms together.
- What?

73
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:51,705
What?

74
00:02:51,706 --> 00:02:54,536
(Tie what?)

75
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:57,806
(The 3 main elements of Handsome Guys)

76
00:02:58,106 --> 00:03:01,715
(Endless competition)

77
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:02,876
You have a chance of winning.

78
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:04,986
(I will use my left hand.)

79
00:03:05,446 --> 00:03:08,916
(Endless trickery)

80
00:03:09,086 --> 00:03:10,486
Start.

81
00:03:10,556 --> 00:03:14,356
(Endless mockery)

82
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:16,125
I promise not to eat it.

83
00:03:16,126 --> 00:03:19,166
(Breaking the long history of individualism)

84
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:22,665
(It will make them realize the importance of teamwork.)

85
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:23,736
What's wrong?

86
00:03:24,606 --> 00:03:26,205
(An extraordinary measure)

87
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:28,406
(Shortage in Privacy)

88
00:03:28,736 --> 00:03:32,946
(Life without privacy starts now.)

89
00:03:33,376 --> 00:03:34,746
All five of us?

90
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:36,815
We have to ask him how they'll tie us.

91
00:03:36,816 --> 00:03:38,256
They could tie our hands separately.

92
00:03:38,516 --> 00:03:39,845
I will explain.

93
00:03:39,846 --> 00:03:42,185
The bracelet will be for two people.

94
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:44,026
I see. Two people?

95
00:03:44,956 --> 00:03:46,426
You will play a game now.

96
00:03:47,196 --> 00:03:48,995
The winner of the game...

97
00:03:48,996 --> 00:03:51,395
will be given the power as the Handsome Guys' chieftain.

98
00:03:51,396 --> 00:03:52,626
- "Chieftain?" - Yes.

99
00:03:53,126 --> 00:03:54,965
Without putting on the bracelet,

100
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:56,395
the chieftain may live freely.

101
00:03:56,396 --> 00:03:57,565
(The chieftain's privacy is guaranteed.)

102
00:03:57,566 --> 00:03:58,865
- That's amazing.
- The chieftain will be given...

103
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:02,305
the authority to decide how to pair people up for the bracelet...

104
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:04,105
and give orders to others.

105
00:04:04,106 --> 00:04:05,426
- He can also give orders?
- Yes.

106
00:04:05,846 --> 00:04:07,515
- He will be the king.
- It's the game of kings.

107
00:04:07,516 --> 00:04:10,586
We'll start a game to determine the chieftain.

108
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:12,146
This game is...

109
00:04:12,616 --> 00:04:15,886
(On a long, V-shaped field)

110
00:04:16,486 --> 00:04:18,926
Wear a stocking with a ball inside on your face.

111
00:04:19,556 --> 00:04:22,556
Swing it like sangmo and send the can as far as you can.

112
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:24,166
- The can?
- Yes.

113
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:25,495
(However, )

114
00:04:25,496 --> 00:04:28,296
(it will be out if the can gets out of the line.)

115
00:04:29,066 --> 00:04:32,866
(Who will be the 1st generation chieftain of Shortage in Privacy?)

116
00:04:33,306 --> 00:04:36,875
We have to hit it like we would with a baseball bat.

117
00:04:36,876 --> 00:04:38,305
- By spinning the ball.
- And we have to hit it?

118
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:40,215
- That's right.
- I see. Okay.

119
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:41,936
I got my hair done today after a long time.

120
00:04:42,576 --> 00:04:43,915
I know. It would ruin your hair.

121
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:46,286
I'm confident about this game.

122
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:48,055
- I'm good at this.
- Those who are strong...

123
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:49,285
would be good at this.

124
00:04:49,286 --> 00:04:51,056
It's all about how athletic you are.

125
00:04:51,826 --> 00:04:53,802
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
- What will you play?

126
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,225
- I'll play scissors.
- Let's think before we play.

127
00:04:56,226 --> 00:04:58,586
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

128
00:04:58,926 --> 00:05:00,866
(Rock, rock, rock, rock, scissors)

129
00:05:01,196 --> 00:05:03,135
(Dong Hyun gets to go first.)

130
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:06,536
What? What did you say?

131
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:08,346
You said that you'd lose if you play rock.

132
00:05:08,736 --> 00:05:10,005
- Dong Hyun.
- Wait.

133
00:05:10,006 --> 00:05:11,475
- If you play rock...
- Just go first.

134
00:05:11,476 --> 00:05:12,905
You said that you'd lose if you play rock.

135
00:05:12,906 --> 00:05:14,715
- I said, "Ready or not." - Is that what you said?

136
00:05:14,716 --> 00:05:16,375
Let's figure out the order after Dong Hyun plays.

137
00:05:16,376 --> 00:05:17,486
Goodness.

138
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:20,256
I have to open it wide.

139
00:05:20,586 --> 00:05:21,586
Here I go.

140
00:05:21,587 --> 00:05:22,862
(Putting the stocking on his face immediately)

141
00:05:22,886 --> 00:05:24,886
I'll look scarier than you think when I put it on.

142
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:26,826
Can you not see through it?

143
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,596
- You can.
- You can see everything.

144
00:05:31,366 --> 00:05:32,425
- Nice.
- Peekaboo.

145
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:35,036
(How do I look? Don't I look scary?)

146
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,165
- He looks better like this.
- You look much better.

147
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:38,305
You look much better.

148
00:05:38,306 --> 00:05:39,306
- Do I look okay?
- Yes.

149
00:05:39,307 --> 00:05:41,427
- You look sexy.
- Would it be better if I pull this?

150
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:42,536
(Stretching)

151
00:05:43,306 --> 00:05:44,445
Your face looks much better like this.

152
00:05:44,446 --> 00:05:46,846
(He looks perfect in the stocking.)

153
00:05:47,476 --> 00:05:49,215
Put on the stocking now.

154
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,286
Really?

155
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:53,655
- I already have it on.
- Put on the stocking.

156
00:05:53,656 --> 00:05:54,896
(How can I put on another one?)

157
00:05:55,256 --> 00:05:57,456
(Laughing)

158
00:05:57,756 --> 00:05:58,756
Okay, here I go.

159
00:05:58,757 --> 00:06:00,126
I can't see.

160
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:03,226
Open your eyes. Okay.

161
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:07,336
(Securing his view)

162
00:06:07,996 --> 00:06:10,095
(Exploding with laughter)

163
00:06:10,096 --> 00:06:11,136
Okay.

164
00:06:12,006 --> 00:06:14,876
(Now that he's ready, he starts.)

165
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:16,835
Okay.

166
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:18,945
(Dong Hyun's hitting the can is in full swing.)

167
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,715
- He's good at it.
- He's good.

168
00:06:20,716 --> 00:06:23,145
(Staggering)

169
00:06:23,146 --> 00:06:24,146
This is hard.

170
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:26,956
- He missed his swing.
- This is hard.

171
00:06:27,456 --> 00:06:29,096
It's hard. Isn't it okay to miss a swing?

172
00:06:29,686 --> 00:06:30,925
The rule is...

173
00:06:30,926 --> 00:06:32,325
that the can has to land inside the line.

174
00:06:32,326 --> 00:06:34,446
(It's accepted only when the can is inside the line.)

175
00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:36,026
(Thud)

176
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:39,125
(Grunting)

177
00:06:39,126 --> 00:06:40,936
Time-out. You can't interrupt.

178
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:43,835
(You just wait and see.)

179
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:44,866
Hey.

180
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,035
Hey!

181
00:06:47,036 --> 00:06:48,176
(He got hit one more time.)

182
00:06:49,006 --> 00:06:50,006
(Dong Hyun is off to a good start.)

183
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:51,076
That's so funny.

184
00:06:51,146 --> 00:06:53,345
- Here I go.
- What if it's really difficult?

185
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,515
That's so funny.

186
00:06:54,516 --> 00:06:56,592
- It could be random...
- There should be a time limit.

187
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:57,985
There's no time limit. Take your time.

188
00:06:57,986 --> 00:07:00,046
- I can't see.
- Two, three.

189
00:07:00,656 --> 00:07:01,755
(Staggering)

190
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:03,085
Lean forward a little.

191
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:04,585
(Staggering again and again)

192
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:05,586
Lean forward.

193
00:07:05,856 --> 00:07:08,226
(Try to hit the can.)

194
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,325
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

195
00:07:10,326 --> 00:07:11,425
(He's close...)

196
00:07:11,426 --> 00:07:12,766
(to hitting it.)

197
00:07:13,866 --> 00:07:17,366
(Trying with all his might)

198
00:07:17,636 --> 00:07:18,966
When will he ever hit it?

199
00:07:19,806 --> 00:07:20,806
Gosh, look at that.

200
00:07:21,636 --> 00:07:22,836
Gosh, look at that.

201
00:07:23,206 --> 00:07:25,975
(Right...)

202
00:07:25,976 --> 00:07:27,676
(at that time)

203
00:07:28,116 --> 00:07:30,786
(The can flew away somehow.)

204
00:07:30,946 --> 00:07:31,986
(Screaming)

205
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:34,986
- It's out.
- It's out. It went over the line.

206
00:07:35,116 --> 00:07:37,126
Why? Why is it out?

207
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:39,886
- Why?
- You have two chances.

208
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:41,026
Wait, time-out.

209
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,326
(It went outside the line.)

210
00:07:42,456 --> 00:07:43,456
Wait, time-out.

211
00:07:43,457 --> 00:07:44,526
(In a hurry)

212
00:07:45,126 --> 00:07:47,566
In some cases, doesn't it count even if it goes out the line?

213
00:07:48,066 --> 00:07:50,406
- Then why would there be a line?
- Just do it first.

214
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:52,066
It looks very difficult.

215
00:07:54,506 --> 00:07:56,805
Dong Hyun, if you fail again this time, it'll be a foul.

216
00:07:56,806 --> 00:07:57,846
Okay.

217
00:07:59,306 --> 00:08:02,116
(Concentrating)

218
00:08:02,946 --> 00:08:04,585
Just come straight up.

219
00:08:04,586 --> 00:08:06,485
Yes, step forward little by little.

220
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,585
- A little more.
- Take one step.

221
00:08:07,586 --> 00:08:09,386
- Forward.
- Come forward.

222
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:12,185
(He approaches it with stability.)

223
00:08:12,186 --> 00:08:13,256
(Tap)

224
00:08:14,556 --> 00:08:16,255
Okay.

225
00:08:16,256 --> 00:08:17,265
(The can gets hit and flies off.)

226
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:18,266
- He did well.
- He's good.

227
00:08:18,267 --> 00:08:19,366
(In awe)

228
00:08:19,896 --> 00:08:21,235
- I will...
- Measure it accurately.

229
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:22,342
- Leave it up to me.
- Where will you measure it?

230
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:23,695
- I will look at this point.
- What?

231
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:25,105
- The middle point.
- No way.

232
00:08:25,106 --> 00:08:26,642
- Should I measure it from here?
- Yes.

233
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,376
It's 7m and 2cm.

234
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:31,645
Isn't that right?

235
00:08:31,646 --> 00:08:33,815
(He did a good job.)

236
00:08:33,816 --> 00:08:35,976
(He really did.)

237
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,216
- It's 7m and 2cm.
- Yes.

238
00:08:38,346 --> 00:08:39,385
I can't see anything.

239
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,756
(Dong Hyun's record: 7m 2cm)

240
00:08:41,986 --> 00:08:42,986
(The eldest Tae Hyun goes second.)

241
00:08:42,987 --> 00:08:45,286
(Wrinkled)

242
00:08:45,926 --> 00:08:47,195
How did you open your eyes?

243
00:08:47,196 --> 00:08:49,155
- You can't open your eyes.
- You have to open them.

244
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:50,325
- Right.
- He can't open them.

245
00:08:50,326 --> 00:08:52,526
(I told you that you couldn't.)

246
00:08:54,066 --> 00:08:55,666
He looks like a walrus.

247
00:08:56,566 --> 00:09:00,036
(Did a walrus appear on land?)

248
00:09:00,636 --> 00:09:01,676
Did I look like that?

249
00:09:01,976 --> 00:09:03,405
- You looked amazing, Dong Hyun.
- I looked amazing?

250
00:09:03,406 --> 00:09:04,745
- You looked better than him.
- Did I?

251
00:09:04,746 --> 00:09:05,786
(He actually believes it.)

252
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,475
Can't I see because of my hair?

253
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:10,946
(Tae Hyun tries to hit the can.)

254
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:13,346
There's a sense of stability.

255
00:09:13,347 --> 00:09:14,385
(His sangmo spins without shaking.)

256
00:09:14,386 --> 00:09:17,055
- Are you starting?
- Why can't I hit the can?

257
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,155
- Tae Hyun.
- You have to step forward.

258
00:09:18,156 --> 00:09:20,085
- Did I do that too?
- You have to go forward.

259
00:09:20,086 --> 00:09:22,826
- Swing it harder.
- A little more.

260
00:09:23,826 --> 00:09:25,666
A little more.

261
00:09:25,996 --> 00:09:28,566
(Did he hit the can in an instant?)

262
00:09:28,796 --> 00:09:31,005
- Okay, it's out.
- Goodness.

263
00:09:31,006 --> 00:09:33,406
(Yes, it went out.)

264
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:35,535
- It's a foul.
- It's a foul.

265
00:09:35,536 --> 00:09:37,416
(Unfortunately, the can went outside the line.)

266
00:09:37,906 --> 00:09:38,945
Tae Hyun, it's your last chance.

267
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:40,586
(He tries it the second time right away.)

268
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:41,715
That's not necessary.

269
00:09:41,716 --> 00:09:44,015
(He swings it again without hesitation.)

270
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:45,016
That looks good.

271
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:48,655
(He hits the can in one go.)

272
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:50,356
(It's out again.)

273
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:51,586
Okay, it's out.

274
00:09:51,756 --> 00:09:52,885
(Regretful)

275
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:53,895
- It's out.
- It's over.

276
00:09:53,896 --> 00:09:55,426
- It's over.
- How did you raise it?

277
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:56,656
I'll pull it out for you.

278
00:09:58,066 --> 00:10:01,396
(I'll pull off the stocking first.)

279
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:04,535
- How did you...
- Tae Hyun, I did it.

280
00:10:04,536 --> 00:10:07,476
Anyone who keeps it within the line will win.

281
00:10:07,676 --> 00:10:09,835
- Dong Hyun did really well.
- Seriously.

282
00:10:09,836 --> 00:10:11,105
Okay, will I become the king today?

283
00:10:11,106 --> 00:10:12,245
(Anticipating)

284
00:10:12,246 --> 00:10:13,246
Next up is Sang Uk.

285
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:16,015
(Sang Uk goes third.)

286
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,336
Is it possible to see through it?

287
00:10:19,946 --> 00:10:22,185
- It's because of your hair.
- Your hair is blocking your view.

288
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:23,456
Isn't it because of my hair?

289
00:10:24,086 --> 00:10:25,755
You couldn't see because of your hair.

290
00:10:25,756 --> 00:10:27,426
(I should've put my hair back.)

291
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:29,025
"Is it possible to see through it?"

292
00:10:29,026 --> 00:10:30,026
(You can't see anything when you block your view.)

293
00:10:30,027 --> 00:10:31,066
"I can't see anything."

294
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:34,296
(That's cute.)

295
00:10:35,036 --> 00:10:37,836
(He puts his hair back and puts it on properly.)

296
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:42,606
(Handsome Boy Sang Uk)

297
00:10:43,836 --> 00:10:45,145
(He's still handsome with it.)

298
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:46,386
You have to open your eyes big.

299
00:10:48,846 --> 00:10:50,986
You actually look nice.

300
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:54,815
- Make it big.
- There it is.

301
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:56,385
Wait, time-out.

302
00:10:56,386 --> 00:10:58,355
You can't use your hand.

303
00:10:58,356 --> 00:11:00,285
- But...
- Swing it without your hand.

304
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:01,695
- You can't do that.
- I can't do this either?

305
00:11:01,696 --> 00:11:02,872
Put your hands behind your back.

306
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,465
(Why is he so strict?)

307
00:11:04,466 --> 00:11:06,472
- Do I have to do it like this?
- Yes, everyone did that.

308
00:11:06,496 --> 00:11:07,496
Start from the beginning.

309
00:11:07,497 --> 00:11:09,097
(Starting with his arms behind his back)

310
00:11:09,596 --> 00:11:11,782
You won't beat me at that speed. You have to swing harder.

311
00:11:11,806 --> 00:11:14,106
Swing harder. Yes, move forward. You have to get closer.

312
00:11:15,176 --> 00:11:16,406
(Stumbling)

313
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,006
Why can't I hit it?

314
00:11:20,476 --> 00:11:22,646
(The moment he shouts)

315
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,386
(What?)

316
00:11:26,286 --> 00:11:29,316
(What happened?)

317
00:11:30,786 --> 00:11:32,055
Gosh, it went far.

318
00:11:32,056 --> 00:11:33,726
(Sang Uk's can went quite far.)

319
00:11:34,826 --> 00:11:37,126
(Urgent)

320
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:39,125
- I lost.
- Dong Hyun's can went farther.

321
00:11:39,126 --> 00:11:41,495
- Did I lose? No, I won.
- Gosh.

322
00:11:41,496 --> 00:11:42,896
- Dong Hyun won.
- It's six meters.

323
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,765
- That doesn't work.
- It's 6m 62cm.

324
00:11:44,766 --> 00:11:45,835
Oh, my. Was it too weak?

325
00:11:45,836 --> 00:11:47,236
- Yes, it was weak.
- It's 6m 62cm.

326
00:11:48,106 --> 00:11:51,146
(Immediately, he tries again for the second time.)

327
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:54,145
He became serious.

328
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,416
Would it hurt if you get hit...

329
00:11:57,546 --> 00:11:59,085
- What's wrong with you?
- It must hurt when it hits you.

330
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,386
- My goodness.
- That's good.

331
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,155
- That's good.
- You got it.

332
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:03,156
(Charging forward without reserve)

333
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,156
That's good.

334
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:05,156
(Tap)

335
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,896
(Yes, it's out.)

336
00:12:08,756 --> 00:12:12,396
(Oh, no...)

337
00:12:12,496 --> 00:12:14,365
His record is 6m 62cm.

338
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:17,306
(Dong Hyun is in 1st place.)

339
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,466
I'll go next.

340
00:12:21,506 --> 00:12:22,506
(Swinging)

341
00:12:22,507 --> 00:12:24,705
Oh, my goodness.

342
00:12:24,706 --> 00:12:29,276
(Yi Kyung goes on a rampage.)

343
00:12:30,446 --> 00:12:32,586
Gosh, that's incredible.

344
00:12:33,116 --> 00:12:35,956
(Yi Kyung tries to hit the can.)

345
00:12:36,316 --> 00:12:38,455
- Yi Kyung, if you hit it like that, - That's amazing.

346
00:12:38,456 --> 00:12:39,526
The can would fly 20m.

347
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:40,656
Do it.

348
00:12:41,856 --> 00:12:43,256
Move forward a little. That's good.

349
00:12:43,656 --> 00:12:45,265
You got it.

350
00:12:45,266 --> 00:12:46,866
You'll win first place if you hit it.

351
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,865
- I'll make it faster.
- Swing harder.

352
00:12:51,866 --> 00:12:52,866
He's got it.

353
00:12:53,806 --> 00:12:55,205
- You got it.
- Just come forward.

354
00:12:55,206 --> 00:12:56,376
- He's here.
- Keep going.

355
00:12:57,576 --> 00:12:58,745
- A little closer.
- He hit it.

356
00:12:58,746 --> 00:13:03,245
(The can flies off as soon as they finish talking.)

357
00:13:03,246 --> 00:13:04,545
He brushed it lightly.

358
00:13:04,546 --> 00:13:05,785
You missed it.

359
00:13:05,786 --> 00:13:07,746
You should hit it in one go while moving forward.

360
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:09,186
I missed it.

361
00:13:09,187 --> 00:13:11,186
(Regretful)

362
00:13:12,226 --> 00:13:13,255
(Yi Kyung tries again right away.)

363
00:13:13,256 --> 00:13:14,596
- It's your last chance.
- Okay.

364
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:18,466
- You've got it.
- Hit a home run.

365
00:13:19,026 --> 00:13:20,065
The angle doesn't look good.

366
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,066
- The angle is too low...
- Oh, my.

367
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,636
- The angle is too low...
- Oh, my. He hit the camera.

368
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:27,006
The angle is...

369
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,807
(He hit it in one go, but it was the camera.)

370
00:13:28,836 --> 00:13:30,506
(Flustered)

371
00:13:31,006 --> 00:13:32,476
Please hurry and measure it.

372
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:33,846
He dropped the camera.

373
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,145
He can't hit the can.

374
00:13:36,146 --> 00:13:37,245
(He's strong, but he can't hit the can.)

375
00:13:37,246 --> 00:13:38,545
He can't hit the can.

376
00:13:38,546 --> 00:13:40,546
(His body can't keep up with his strength.)

377
00:13:40,886 --> 00:13:42,986
- You have to hit it straight.
- Take it out.

378
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:44,385
Should I swing it from here?

379
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:46,255
You have to hit it this way, but you hit it in this direction.

380
00:13:46,256 --> 00:13:47,256
(They handled it neatly.)

381
00:13:48,826 --> 00:13:50,556
- You got it.
- That's it, Yi Kyung.

382
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:52,295
- It's too weak.
- A little harder.

383
00:13:52,296 --> 00:13:53,325
That's it.

384
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:55,396
(Screaming in awe)

385
00:13:56,436 --> 00:14:00,306
(You can clearly tell that the can went far.)

386
00:14:01,236 --> 00:14:04,806
(Anticipating)

387
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,176
That was amazing.

388
00:14:10,376 --> 00:14:12,715
- It's 8m 81cm.
- It's 8m 81cm?

389
00:14:12,716 --> 00:14:13,836
(His second record, 8m 81cm)

390
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:14,986
I knew it.

391
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:16,956
(I can't be the chieftain.)

392
00:14:17,216 --> 00:14:18,226
What did I tell you?

393
00:14:18,826 --> 00:14:20,056
Hey, you know...

394
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,726
- I was happy for a while.
- Right.

395
00:14:22,396 --> 00:14:24,395
(Seung Ho goes last.)

396
00:14:24,396 --> 00:14:25,876
Is Yi Kyung currently in first place?

397
00:14:28,296 --> 00:14:29,536
Wait, what are you doing?

398
00:14:30,096 --> 00:14:31,705
- That's unbelievable.
- That's unbelievable.

399
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:33,106
He looks exactly the same.

400
00:14:33,406 --> 00:14:35,135
(Seung Ho is busy putting on the stocking.)

401
00:14:35,136 --> 00:14:37,475
I have terrible eyesight.

402
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,505
(I have terrible eyesight.)

403
00:14:38,506 --> 00:14:39,706
- What's wrong?
- I mean...

404
00:14:39,776 --> 00:14:41,245
- His eyes are completely normal.
- It's like he has nothing on.

405
00:14:41,246 --> 00:14:42,246
I mean...

406
00:14:42,247 --> 00:14:43,775
It's like he isn't wearing any stocking.

407
00:14:43,776 --> 00:14:45,486
Time-out. Do you usually wear glasses?

408
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:46,946
Time-out.

409
00:14:48,086 --> 00:14:49,755
(His tongue peeks out.)

410
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,255
- What's that?
- That's cheating.

411
00:14:51,256 --> 00:14:52,556
You just have to swing it.

412
00:14:53,156 --> 00:14:54,955
- Wait a minute.
- Goodness, he looks the same.

413
00:14:54,956 --> 00:14:55,956
You look exactly the same.

414
00:14:55,957 --> 00:14:57,642
- I want to be able to talk.
- Right now...

415
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:59,025
- Wait a minute.
- It looks like you got a massage.

416
00:14:59,026 --> 00:15:00,695
(Rascal Seung Ho is the king of tricks in this area.)

417
00:15:00,696 --> 00:15:01,895
Do you usually wear glasses?

418
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:03,135
- Seung Ho...
- Occasionally.

419
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,565
- Do you usually wear glasses?
- Yes, occasionally.

420
00:15:04,566 --> 00:15:06,105
He's full of petty tricks.

421
00:15:06,106 --> 00:15:07,575
- He's unbelievable.
- He's unbelievable.

422
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:09,416
I can't believe it. He looks exactly the same.

423
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,075
All right, here I go.

424
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,776
(Seung Ho tries to hit the can.)

425
00:15:14,216 --> 00:15:15,846
It'd be nice if you could hit it for me.

426
00:15:16,346 --> 00:15:17,986
That looks good. Hit it just like that.

427
00:15:18,186 --> 00:15:19,245
Hit it just like that.

428
00:15:19,246 --> 00:15:20,246
(His eyes are fixed on it.)

429
00:15:20,247 --> 00:15:21,687
- Hit it just like that.
- Goodness.

430
00:15:21,986 --> 00:15:24,985
His technique is different. Look at that.

431
00:15:24,986 --> 00:15:26,226
- He's about to head it.
- Yes.

432
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:27,895
You're not even close.

433
00:15:27,896 --> 00:15:29,172
(He's not at all close to hitting it.)

434
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:30,395
You have to step a lot forward.

435
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:31,895
You have to get much closer.

436
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:33,026
Wait a minute.

437
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:35,566
- It's too weak.
- You have to move up a lot.

438
00:15:36,196 --> 00:15:37,396
- It's too weak.
- It gets...

439
00:15:37,966 --> 00:15:39,082
- It's too weak.
- It gets...

440
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:40,235
stuck in the teeth.

441
00:15:40,236 --> 00:15:43,476
(It gets stuck in the teeth.)

442
00:15:44,106 --> 00:15:46,976
(Why did you tear it in the first place?)

443
00:15:47,406 --> 00:15:48,816
Take it out of your teeth.

444
00:15:48,976 --> 00:15:50,045
Goodness.

445
00:15:50,046 --> 00:15:51,446
- I apologize.
- Like dental floss?

446
00:15:51,486 --> 00:15:54,286
Some might be having a late dinner right now.

447
00:15:54,686 --> 00:15:55,785
This is...

448
00:15:55,786 --> 00:15:57,655
I'll just put it in my mouth.

449
00:15:57,656 --> 00:15:59,286
That looks good.

450
00:16:00,486 --> 00:16:04,926
(A more striking impression)

451
00:16:04,996 --> 00:16:06,195
He looks like...

452
00:16:06,196 --> 00:16:08,165
someone named Stocking Man.

453
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:09,766
He looks like a type of character.

454
00:16:10,466 --> 00:16:11,506
That's good.

455
00:16:12,536 --> 00:16:13,705
(Stocking Man)

456
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,205
Let me explain why, Seung Ho.

457
00:16:15,206 --> 00:16:16,206
(Stocking Man)

458
00:16:16,207 --> 00:16:17,335
- That's it.
- You have to spin it.

459
00:16:17,336 --> 00:16:18,576
- That's right.
- That's it.

460
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:20,845
- You have to spin it.
- That's it.

461
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,075
(Shall I go?)

462
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:23,146
(Thud)

463
00:16:24,446 --> 00:16:25,615
As you ripped the stocking,

464
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:27,185
the threads came undone.

465
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,186
It weakened the elasticity.

466
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:32,286
It's because it's pulling forward.

467
00:16:32,656 --> 00:16:34,595
Move forward.

468
00:16:34,596 --> 00:16:35,596
- It's wrapping around him.
- Hit the can.

469
00:16:35,597 --> 00:16:37,195
It's wrapping around you again.

470
00:16:37,196 --> 00:16:38,436
It's wrapping around your face.

471
00:16:38,496 --> 00:16:39,625
You have to lower your face.

472
00:16:39,626 --> 00:16:40,825
- His face...
- Goodness.

473
00:16:40,826 --> 00:16:42,766
(Spinning)

474
00:16:43,796 --> 00:16:44,906
(Why isn't it working?)

475
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,536
He got caught in his own trap.

476
00:16:49,576 --> 00:16:50,806
His own trap.

477
00:16:51,746 --> 00:16:53,046
You just have to hit it.

478
00:16:53,176 --> 00:16:55,415
- You have to move up a lot.
- As long as he hits the middle...

479
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,816
Move up more.

480
00:16:56,946 --> 00:16:58,516
More.

481
00:16:59,016 --> 00:17:02,856
(His can finally flies off.)

482
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:05,355
You know what?

483
00:17:05,356 --> 00:17:06,655
The top part is torn.

484
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:07,855
(Upset)

485
00:17:07,856 --> 00:17:09,472
There's no point in measuring the distance.

486
00:17:09,496 --> 00:17:11,125
It's 4m 70cm.

487
00:17:11,126 --> 00:17:12,625
(Yi Kyung is in 1st place.)

488
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:14,065
The final winner is...

489
00:17:14,066 --> 00:17:15,395
- Yi Kyung.
- Isn't it Yi Kyung?

490
00:17:15,396 --> 00:17:17,335
(The 1st generation chieftain is Yi Kyung.)

491
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,335
Yi Kyung, please put on this armband.

492
00:17:19,336 --> 00:17:20,865
Pair up people to tie...

493
00:17:20,866 --> 00:17:22,076
with the bracelet.

494
00:17:22,536 --> 00:17:24,645
I'd like Seung Ho and Dong Hyun to pair up.

495
00:17:24,646 --> 00:17:26,375
- All right.
- Okay.

496
00:17:26,376 --> 00:17:28,145
(Sang Uk, Tae Hyun and Seung Ho, Dong Hyun)

497
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:29,415
- Okay.
- Goodness.

498
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,885
- Oh, my.
- This is uncomfortable.

499
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:33,885
It will be very tiring for Dong Hyun today.

500
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,285
(It will be very tiring for Dong Hyun today.)

501
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:36,416
This is tiring.

502
00:17:36,516 --> 00:17:37,985
It must be very burdensome.

503
00:17:37,986 --> 00:17:40,185
- Seriously, you know what?
- Hey.

504
00:17:40,186 --> 00:17:41,955
- Let me explain.
- Make it tiring for him.

505
00:17:41,956 --> 00:17:43,125
Tae Hyun is older than me,

506
00:17:43,126 --> 00:17:45,096
but he feels younger to me.

507
00:17:45,526 --> 00:17:47,695
Seung Ho is younger than me, but he feels older than me.

508
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:49,166
(Upset)

509
00:17:51,706 --> 00:17:53,965
The two of you will be soulmates forever.

510
00:17:53,966 --> 00:17:54,975
Okay.

511
00:17:54,976 --> 00:17:56,582
(Seung Ho and Dong Hyun put on the bracelet.)

512
00:17:56,606 --> 00:17:58,082
Your wrist is smaller than I thought.

513
00:17:58,106 --> 00:17:59,406
This is very short.

514
00:17:59,476 --> 00:18:01,175
- It's really short.
- I feel so free.

515
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:02,496
We have to move around like this?

516
00:18:03,646 --> 00:18:05,045
I feel so free.

517
00:18:05,046 --> 00:18:08,016
(Gosh, I'm free.)

518
00:18:09,186 --> 00:18:11,086
Already...

519
00:18:11,426 --> 00:18:14,055
(Being pulled around)

520
00:18:14,056 --> 00:18:15,925
- Already...
- Where are you going?

521
00:18:15,926 --> 00:18:17,456
(Where are you going?)

522
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:19,026
Can you give me some tissue?

523
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,295
- I want to wipe off my sweat.
- Dong Hyun has to follow him.

524
00:18:21,296 --> 00:18:22,435
(Dong Hyun has to move with Seung Ho.)

525
00:18:22,436 --> 00:18:23,636
He came for some tissue.

526
00:18:23,736 --> 00:18:25,166
Look at Dong Hyun follow him.

527
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:27,706
(Laughing)

528
00:18:28,436 --> 00:18:30,635
It's hot. It's so hot today.

529
00:18:30,636 --> 00:18:32,146
(One body and spirit)

530
00:18:32,246 --> 00:18:35,115
Under my command,

531
00:18:35,116 --> 00:18:37,175
- we have to set up these tents.
- Let's do it.

532
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:39,286
There are two, so please open each of them.

533
00:18:40,146 --> 00:18:41,255
Let's carry this.

534
00:18:41,256 --> 00:18:42,556
(Let's carry this.)

535
00:18:42,886 --> 00:18:44,185
(It's hard to carry it alone because one arm is tied.)

536
00:18:44,186 --> 00:18:45,355
Let's go.

537
00:18:45,356 --> 00:18:46,902
(It's hard to carry it alone because one arm is tied.)

538
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:49,225
- Let's just sleep outside.
- Right.

539
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:50,356
The weather is nice anyway.

540
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:53,226
I don't know how to set up a tent.

541
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:56,636
Set it up with your team.

542
00:18:56,736 --> 00:18:57,866
Hey, listen.

543
00:18:58,266 --> 00:18:59,366
Listen.

544
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,705
- Seung Ho, I'm feeling hot.
- Yes?

545
00:19:01,706 --> 00:19:03,036
Can I take off one of the tops?

546
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,146
Go ahead, but you have to hang it on you.

547
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:08,475
(He takes off his top quickly.)

548
00:19:08,476 --> 00:19:09,575
When I take it off...

549
00:19:09,576 --> 00:19:10,816
(He takes off his top quickly.)

550
00:19:12,716 --> 00:19:13,945
Can't I untie it for a minute?

551
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:15,056
No.

552
00:19:15,116 --> 00:19:16,586
My goodness.

553
00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:18,925
Why not? I mean...

554
00:19:18,926 --> 00:19:21,026
I'm sorry, but you have to keep it like this.

555
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:22,095
- This? Wait a minute.
- Yes.

556
00:19:22,096 --> 00:19:23,616
- Let's do this instead.
- But this...

557
00:19:23,926 --> 00:19:24,995
What if I give it to you?

558
00:19:24,996 --> 00:19:26,125
Why would you give it to me?

559
00:19:26,126 --> 00:19:27,195
I can't?

560
00:19:27,196 --> 00:19:29,036
Since it's a nice top, give it to me.

561
00:19:29,466 --> 00:19:30,965
I have to keep it with me.

562
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:32,366
(Oh, it won't work.)

563
00:19:32,466 --> 00:19:34,675
Or it could look like...

564
00:19:34,676 --> 00:19:36,336
a rope used on criminals.

565
00:19:36,836 --> 00:19:38,745
- Like this.
- Cover it.

566
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:39,805
(Taking off clothes isn't easy during Shortage in Privacy.)

567
00:19:39,806 --> 00:19:40,876
- Like this?
- Yes.

568
00:19:41,516 --> 00:19:44,416
(Tae Hyun and Sang Uk, on the other hand)

569
00:19:44,946 --> 00:19:46,116
Is this correct?

570
00:19:46,316 --> 00:19:47,716
(Is this correct?)

571
00:19:49,656 --> 00:19:50,756
Spread it out.

572
00:19:50,956 --> 00:19:51,985
Spread it out?

573
00:19:51,986 --> 00:19:53,586
(At a loss)

574
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:55,095
Spread it out?

575
00:19:55,096 --> 00:19:57,496
(He tossed it aside for now.)

576
00:19:57,926 --> 00:19:58,996
What's that?

577
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:03,095
- Let's see.
- It looks like the top.

578
00:20:03,096 --> 00:20:04,195
This part. Don't you think?

579
00:20:04,196 --> 00:20:05,312
(They're unfamiliar with all the camping tools.)

580
00:20:05,336 --> 00:20:07,706
Isn't this...

581
00:20:08,476 --> 00:20:09,605
This is the door.

582
00:20:09,606 --> 00:20:11,546
- Tae Hyun, it's the floor.
- Is it the floor?

583
00:20:11,746 --> 00:20:13,505
- Isn't it the other side?
- Isn't it the floor?

584
00:20:13,506 --> 00:20:14,575
- The floor.
- Like this?

585
00:20:14,576 --> 00:20:16,052
(They find a piece that looks like the floor.)

586
00:20:16,076 --> 00:20:17,115
My goodness.

587
00:20:17,116 --> 00:20:18,485
(Stumbling)

588
00:20:18,486 --> 00:20:20,085
(Shortage in Privacy and Camping Skills)

589
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,186
Like this?

590
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:24,415
- This is done.
- We have to build the structure.

591
00:20:24,416 --> 00:20:26,416
(Seung Ho and Dong Hyun took care of the clothes.)

592
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,925
(They start working with poles smoothly.)

593
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:31,366
Let's cross them.

594
00:20:33,096 --> 00:20:35,566
(Effortless)

595
00:20:36,266 --> 00:20:38,366
I've done it before.

596
00:20:39,866 --> 00:20:42,605
(Great teamwork)

597
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:43,975
Gosh.

598
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:44,976
It's no big deal.

599
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:47,506
- We've done it in the military.
- Of course.

600
00:20:49,546 --> 00:20:51,315
That's right. It's so easy.

601
00:20:51,316 --> 00:20:52,816
(It's so easy.)

602
00:20:53,346 --> 00:20:54,386
Yes.

603
00:20:54,656 --> 00:20:55,715
We can't do that side.

604
00:20:55,716 --> 00:20:57,396
(They become one and work well as a team.)

605
00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:59,486
Push it.

606
00:21:00,426 --> 00:21:01,725
It's nice to work with Seung Ho.

607
00:21:01,726 --> 00:21:03,856
He's good at getting things done. Push it.

608
00:21:04,766 --> 00:21:05,866
By the way,

609
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:07,666
why are you so far away from each other?

610
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,266
- What happened?
- What?

611
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:11,265
- What?
- How did this happen?

612
00:21:11,266 --> 00:21:12,936
(Flustered)

613
00:21:13,036 --> 00:21:14,835
- Wait a minute.
- I mean...

614
00:21:14,836 --> 00:21:16,135
- No one realized it.
- Wait.

615
00:21:16,136 --> 00:21:17,706
- No one realized it.
- Wait a minute.

616
00:21:19,106 --> 00:21:20,345
- Seriously, how did it happen?
- It startled me.

617
00:21:20,346 --> 00:21:21,415
Hold on.

618
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,275
- Did you untie it?
- I really didn't.

619
00:21:23,276 --> 00:21:24,476
I didn't untie it either.

620
00:21:24,646 --> 00:21:26,716
(Just a moment ago)

621
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:31,185
(The bracelet got untied by itself.)

622
00:21:31,186 --> 00:21:36,856
(They were focused on work without anyone noticing it.)

623
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:38,765
By the way,

624
00:21:38,766 --> 00:21:40,195
we got separated.

625
00:21:40,196 --> 00:21:41,535
- Why didn't anyone realize it?
- No one realized it.

626
00:21:41,536 --> 00:21:43,695
- This is what they said.
- Could you rewind the video?

627
00:21:43,696 --> 00:21:44,936
When did it get untied?

628
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:46,306
I was wondering why...

629
00:21:46,936 --> 00:21:48,576
they were so fast.

630
00:21:49,106 --> 00:21:50,906
This one is very difficult. Wait.

631
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:52,306
This...

632
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:54,246
Okay.

633
00:21:54,916 --> 00:21:56,915
We got it.

634
00:21:56,916 --> 00:21:58,415
- And...
- My goodness.

635
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,585
Hey.

636
00:21:59,586 --> 00:22:00,715
(Flustered)

637
00:22:00,716 --> 00:22:01,755
Should I hold it?

638
00:22:01,756 --> 00:22:03,055
Yes.

639
00:22:03,056 --> 00:22:04,215
- You have to come back.
- But I...

640
00:22:04,216 --> 00:22:05,285
You have to come back.

641
00:22:05,286 --> 00:22:06,286
I have to do this too.

642
00:22:06,287 --> 00:22:08,556
- This side fell out completely.
- Really?

643
00:22:09,326 --> 00:22:11,395
Maybe we can't nail it to the ground.

644
00:22:11,396 --> 00:22:12,872
Instead of nailing it, let's just make it stand.

645
00:22:12,896 --> 00:22:14,526
You have to come this way.

646
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:16,166
From here...

647
00:22:16,436 --> 00:22:17,466
Look.

648
00:22:17,536 --> 00:22:19,606
- This is...
- Dong Hyun, go this way.

649
00:22:19,706 --> 00:22:20,835
Wait. Oh, no.

650
00:22:20,836 --> 00:22:22,275
- It's okay.
- It's okay.

651
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:23,576
This is so nice.

652
00:22:24,306 --> 00:22:25,376
Goodness.

653
00:22:25,576 --> 00:22:28,376
(Enjoying the freedom of his both hands)

654
00:22:29,076 --> 00:22:31,076
- It's in the air.
- Hey.

655
00:22:32,086 --> 00:22:33,415
Inside the circle...

656
00:22:33,416 --> 00:22:35,055
(The privileges of the chieftain stand out more...)

657
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:36,686
(when compared to the tribesmen.)

658
00:22:37,086 --> 00:22:39,056
(Suddenly getting up)

659
00:22:40,186 --> 00:22:41,326
Do you want me to put it in?

660
00:22:41,496 --> 00:22:43,196
- Please do.
- In here?

661
00:22:43,326 --> 00:22:44,526
- Yes.
- What else?

662
00:22:44,726 --> 00:22:46,026
This isn't easy.

663
00:22:46,596 --> 00:22:47,796
Wait, time-out.

664
00:22:47,896 --> 00:22:49,065
- Why are you helping them?
- Time-out.

665
00:22:49,066 --> 00:22:50,535
You can't do that.

666
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,106
They used their chance.

667
00:22:52,306 --> 00:22:53,606
What chance did they have?

668
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,075
- Their chance with the chieftain.
- What?

669
00:22:56,076 --> 00:22:58,175
Can we also use our chance...

670
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,882
- with the chieftain?
- I'll be there after this.

671
00:22:59,906 --> 00:23:01,275
- Please come now.
- We need someone...

672
00:23:01,276 --> 00:23:02,775
to hold it.

673
00:23:02,776 --> 00:23:04,075
Do you want me to hold it?

674
00:23:04,076 --> 00:23:06,786
(The chieftain is being pushed around.)

675
00:23:07,516 --> 00:23:08,586
Did you put it in?

676
00:23:08,886 --> 00:23:10,586
- Once it's done, please hold it.
- Okay.

677
00:23:10,656 --> 00:23:12,426
Come this way, Seung Ho.

678
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:14,025
(Even if they're tied, )

679
00:23:14,026 --> 00:23:15,525
(it's possible to work.)

680
00:23:15,526 --> 00:23:16,555
We have to bend it like this.

681
00:23:16,556 --> 00:23:17,625
We have to bend it.

682
00:23:17,626 --> 00:23:18,965
(Dong Hyun and Seung Ho's tent is taking its shape fast.)

683
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:20,396
It already looks like a tent.

684
00:23:21,196 --> 00:23:25,365
(Another chieftain chance for the camping beginners)

685
00:23:25,366 --> 00:23:26,735
Put it all the way through.

686
00:23:26,736 --> 00:23:28,336
(With the chieftain's sacrifice...)

687
00:23:28,706 --> 00:23:30,075
- Is this correct?
- It's correct.

688
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:31,276
(And the tribesmen's teamwork)

689
00:23:31,676 --> 00:23:34,246
They also finished setting up the tent mostly.

690
00:23:34,346 --> 00:23:36,175
This is it. It fits perfectly.

691
00:23:36,176 --> 00:23:37,715
- You did it too.
- Here it is.

692
00:23:37,716 --> 00:23:38,815
I think it's set up.

693
00:23:38,816 --> 00:23:40,186
- It's done.
- We're done.

694
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:41,786
Doesn't it look quite nice?

695
00:23:42,186 --> 00:23:43,316
Mr. Chieftain.

696
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:44,956
You will have to eat soon.

697
00:23:45,026 --> 00:23:46,085
Yes.

698
00:23:46,086 --> 00:23:48,796
- Then you'll need to get groceries.
- Okay.

699
00:23:49,456 --> 00:23:51,155
Including yourself,

700
00:23:51,156 --> 00:23:53,165
could you decide who will get groceries?

701
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:54,166
How many people?

702
00:23:54,167 --> 00:23:56,035
You have to take a pair with you.

703
00:23:56,036 --> 00:23:57,572
(Getting groceries with a pair of partners)

704
00:23:57,596 --> 00:23:58,605
(The partners Yi Kyung chose to get groceries with)

705
00:23:58,606 --> 00:23:59,735
Let's go to the supermarket.

706
00:23:59,736 --> 00:24:01,976
If we eat barbecue...

707
00:24:02,036 --> 00:24:03,776
Barbecue is the best when camping.

708
00:24:03,936 --> 00:24:06,045
You guys will eat like beasts again.

709
00:24:06,046 --> 00:24:07,846
(Small Eater Tae Hyun)

710
00:24:08,076 --> 00:24:10,615
(The three of them are on their way to get groceries.)

711
00:24:10,616 --> 00:24:12,696
Yi Kyung, you have to be in charge of making a stew.

712
00:24:12,946 --> 00:24:14,932
- You're good at making stews.
- What do you want to eat?

713
00:24:14,956 --> 00:24:16,055
I'll be in charge of making noodles.

714
00:24:16,056 --> 00:24:17,656
- I'm very confident about it.
- Okay.

715
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,485
Whoever does it, I have to help.

716
00:24:20,486 --> 00:24:22,025
- You need me beside you.
- He does.

717
00:24:22,026 --> 00:24:23,195
(Your work is mine.)

718
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:24,826
I'll help out next to you.

719
00:24:25,896 --> 00:24:26,926
It will be delicious.

720
00:24:27,596 --> 00:24:29,295
I hope that they sell aged kimchi.

721
00:24:29,296 --> 00:24:30,895
I'm sure they will. Ready-made aged kimchi is good these days.

722
00:24:30,896 --> 00:24:33,256
(As they finish planning lunch, they arrive at the market.)

723
00:24:34,506 --> 00:24:36,736
When people see us handcuffed with each other,

724
00:24:37,406 --> 00:24:38,576
they'll find it strange.

725
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:40,475
They would wonder what we did wrong.

726
00:24:40,476 --> 00:24:42,716
(Misunderstanding of the handcuff)

727
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,045
(Thankfully, they enter without being misunderstood.)

728
00:24:45,046 --> 00:24:46,316
Hello.

729
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:49,356
Shall we look at the vegetables first?

730
00:24:50,616 --> 00:24:52,226
Do we have to walk around like this?

731
00:24:54,556 --> 00:24:59,066
(They place their hands between to hide them as much as possible.)

732
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:01,865
- Won't this be enough?
- Yes.

733
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:03,035
(The three pick out ingredients for their lunch.)

734
00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:05,065
These are thick. They should be enough.

735
00:25:05,066 --> 00:25:06,805
- Shop enough for 3 meals.
- Did you say 3 meals?

736
00:25:06,806 --> 00:25:07,966
- Three meals?
- Three meals?

737
00:25:08,236 --> 00:25:10,376
Then we need three times what we have here.

738
00:25:10,606 --> 00:25:14,445
(My goodness)

739
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:16,915
- Okay.
- We need three times more?

740
00:25:16,916 --> 00:25:18,236
We need three times what we have.

741
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:20,146
- All this?
- First...

742
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:21,646
Are we eating meat for every meal?

743
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:23,955
We need meat for every meal.

744
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,556
(That's needless to say.)

745
00:25:26,286 --> 00:25:27,825
Everything looks so good.

746
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:29,095
(While side dishes to accompany meat multiple three times...)

747
00:25:29,096 --> 00:25:30,226
I want to buy everything.

748
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,995
Think carefully. Here's the meat section.

749
00:25:32,996 --> 00:25:35,096
- You decide which meat to grill.
- Okay.

750
00:25:35,166 --> 00:25:36,696
I'll pick out meat for the stew.

751
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,765
We also need pork.

752
00:25:38,766 --> 00:25:40,966
(The key mission area for the carnivore representative)

753
00:25:41,006 --> 00:25:42,635
(After looking around carefully)

754
00:25:42,636 --> 00:25:44,405
First, I'll get this.

755
00:25:44,406 --> 00:25:47,346
(He picks two packs of beef.)

756
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:53,416
(However, Sang Uk gets serious about something.)

757
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:56,155
Gosh, there's too little.

758
00:25:56,156 --> 00:25:59,155
(The amount of meat is too little to satisfy the meat eaters.)

759
00:25:59,156 --> 00:26:00,526
It's too little.

760
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,056
I should look at the number of grams.

761
00:26:03,656 --> 00:26:05,566
Look, it's only 150g.

762
00:26:05,766 --> 00:26:07,026
I have no idea about that.

763
00:26:07,526 --> 00:26:08,795
We need more.

764
00:26:08,796 --> 00:26:12,065
How can we eat meat for all three meals?

765
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:13,405
(Adding more meat in a hurry)

766
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:15,275
What I noticed is that...

767
00:26:15,276 --> 00:26:18,746
(I have to buy enough meat.)

768
00:26:19,846 --> 00:26:22,746
For three meals, we have to buy a lot.

769
00:26:23,216 --> 00:26:25,546
- For 3 meals...
- We're shopping for 3 meals.

770
00:26:26,116 --> 00:26:28,356
- For one of the meals...
- We can eat ramyeon.

771
00:26:28,516 --> 00:26:29,655
What?

772
00:26:29,656 --> 00:26:31,456
We need meat to go with ramyeon.

773
00:26:33,656 --> 00:26:34,785
We can buy it all.

774
00:26:34,786 --> 00:26:38,265
(He ends up buying all the beef.)

775
00:26:38,266 --> 00:26:40,465
Let's just buy two more.

776
00:26:40,466 --> 00:26:41,595
(One counter is completely empty.)

777
00:26:41,596 --> 00:26:43,596
- Feel free to buy a lot.
- What?

778
00:26:43,696 --> 00:26:45,065
Why are you buying so much meat?

779
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:46,105
- Yi Kyung.
- He says that it's right.

780
00:26:46,106 --> 00:26:48,306
- Each has only 150g.
- This is ridiculous.

781
00:26:49,036 --> 00:26:51,205
- That's just the right amount.
- He says that it's right.

782
00:26:51,206 --> 00:26:52,245
We also have to buy pork.

783
00:26:52,246 --> 00:26:54,605
- He also wants to buy pork.
- Fine.

784
00:26:54,606 --> 00:26:57,316
- We can eat it all.
- How many kilograms of meat is it?

785
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,685
(Tae Hyun has no choice but to shop meat with his partner.)

786
00:26:59,686 --> 00:27:01,445
This is also good when we camp.

787
00:27:01,446 --> 00:27:02,486
Then buy it.

788
00:27:03,386 --> 00:27:05,026
Shall we get some pork shoulder?

789
00:27:06,386 --> 00:27:07,956
From the meat section,

790
00:27:08,656 --> 00:27:10,096
we can't move forward.

791
00:27:10,926 --> 00:27:12,425
Five hundred.

792
00:27:12,426 --> 00:27:14,225
Okay, two should be enough.

793
00:27:14,226 --> 00:27:16,795
Really? You're right. Two is enough.

794
00:27:16,796 --> 00:27:18,966
(While shopping carbonated drinks and meat)

795
00:27:19,636 --> 00:27:22,476
(Sang Uk and Tae Hyun move as one body.)

796
00:27:23,576 --> 00:27:24,605
(Neither of them lets go of the cart.)

797
00:27:24,606 --> 00:27:25,675
Look at that.

798
00:27:25,676 --> 00:27:26,945
(Staying side by side)

799
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:28,645
You look very close to each other.

800
00:27:28,646 --> 00:27:32,216
(You look very close to each other.)

801
00:27:32,516 --> 00:27:33,716
Excuse me, sir.

802
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:36,386
Which cut is good for stir-fried pork?

803
00:27:38,016 --> 00:27:39,625
These should be enough.

804
00:27:39,626 --> 00:27:42,395
(He goes around everywhere alone to shop.)

805
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:44,096
We just need some sugar.

806
00:27:45,166 --> 00:27:46,366
Let's get a small one.

807
00:27:47,096 --> 00:27:48,895
- Three bottles for three meals.
- Three bottles.

808
00:27:48,896 --> 00:27:49,966
- Three?
- Yes.

809
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,406
Won't we need 2 of them for 3 meals?

810
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,265
(It's comfortable only for those who are tied.)

811
00:27:54,266 --> 00:27:55,506
We also have ramyeon.

812
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:57,805
- Did we get everything?
- I think so.

813
00:27:57,806 --> 00:28:00,046
(As Yi Kyung got everything fast, the cart became full.)

814
00:28:00,176 --> 00:28:01,645
(The two partners carry a box together...)

815
00:28:01,646 --> 00:28:03,375
(with their tied hands.)

816
00:28:03,376 --> 00:28:04,416
Goodbye.

817
00:28:05,646 --> 00:28:07,945
(Sang Uk is walking awkwardly.)

818
00:28:07,946 --> 00:28:09,956
I think it's better to have the right hand tied.

819
00:28:11,456 --> 00:28:12,576
- What's wrong?
- This is...

820
00:28:12,626 --> 00:28:13,626
(He's comfortable with the height of the box.)

821
00:28:13,627 --> 00:28:14,655
Why are you struggling?

822
00:28:14,656 --> 00:28:17,056
When I walk, my knees bump...

823
00:28:17,456 --> 00:28:19,166
into the box.

824
00:28:19,566 --> 00:28:21,265
It's because your height is different from mine.

825
00:28:21,266 --> 00:28:23,496
(An unexpected discomfort due to the height difference)

826
00:28:24,596 --> 00:28:26,035
- That works.
- Good.

827
00:28:26,036 --> 00:28:27,605
(The chieftain also cleans up the trunk.)

828
00:28:27,606 --> 00:28:28,636
Okay.

829
00:28:29,536 --> 00:28:31,505
- Okay.
- Good.

830
00:28:31,506 --> 00:28:33,145
- Okay.
- Okay.

831
00:28:33,146 --> 00:28:34,246
I'm hungry.

832
00:28:36,676 --> 00:28:37,876
I'm hungry now.

833
00:28:38,886 --> 00:28:40,285
When are we eating?

834
00:28:40,286 --> 00:28:41,545
(They feel hungry after setting up the tent.)

835
00:28:41,546 --> 00:28:43,386
How much groceries are they getting?

836
00:28:44,916 --> 00:28:48,255
(The grocery shopping team finally arrived.)

837
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,296
They're here.

838
00:28:49,696 --> 00:28:50,756
Hello.

839
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:53,695
Well done.

840
00:28:53,696 --> 00:28:58,735
(The chieftain unloads the car right after driving.)

841
00:28:58,736 --> 00:29:00,216
- Goodness.
- Is there anything here?

842
00:29:00,306 --> 00:29:05,146
(The chieftain is sad because his hands are free.)

843
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:08,145
Well done.

844
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:10,976
(They go up to carry the groceries.)

845
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:12,116
It feels cool.

846
00:29:12,117 --> 00:29:13,886
(No way.)

847
00:29:14,446 --> 00:29:15,555
It's hot.

848
00:29:15,556 --> 00:29:18,285
(Desperate for the traces of air conditioning)

849
00:29:18,286 --> 00:29:20,856
I hate both hot and cold. What should I do?

850
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:22,655
It's so hot that I'm sweating.

851
00:29:22,656 --> 00:29:24,226
They ate a lot in here.

852
00:29:25,066 --> 00:29:27,166
(Did they find food in the front seat?)

853
00:29:27,526 --> 00:29:28,965
Dong Hyun won't be happy about it.

854
00:29:28,966 --> 00:29:30,195
So what?

855
00:29:30,196 --> 00:29:31,236
You're right.

856
00:29:31,666 --> 00:29:33,036
Since the eldest is with us...

857
00:29:33,766 --> 00:29:34,805
(That's disappointing.)

858
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:37,605
- You have no sense of loyalty.
- Why didn't you buy some for us?

859
00:29:37,606 --> 00:29:39,445
- You aren't loyal.
- This isn't a competition.

860
00:29:39,446 --> 00:29:42,276
- Buy you what?
- What's all this?

861
00:29:42,416 --> 00:29:43,915
What's this?

862
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,485
(It's proof that they can't deny.)

863
00:29:45,486 --> 00:29:47,616
(They caught us.)

864
00:29:48,216 --> 00:29:50,615
You didn't pick up the trash from somewhere, did you?

865
00:29:50,616 --> 00:29:52,685
We saw it on the street, so we picked it up.

866
00:29:52,686 --> 00:29:54,626
We should do things together. We're united.

867
00:29:54,756 --> 00:29:56,055
- You could've brought some.
- That's...

868
00:29:56,056 --> 00:29:57,626
There's a lot of food.

869
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,826
What?

870
00:29:58,996 --> 00:30:00,725
The amount is huge because it's for three meals.

871
00:30:00,726 --> 00:30:02,665
We cleaned and set everything up.

872
00:30:02,666 --> 00:30:05,236
We only bought some popcorn.

873
00:30:05,966 --> 00:30:07,835
- We have yakgwa.
- They bought a lot of meat.

874
00:30:07,836 --> 00:30:09,675
Do you want some of this?

875
00:30:09,676 --> 00:30:11,035
- It's yakgwa.
- Yakgwa sounds good.

876
00:30:11,036 --> 00:30:12,106
Yakgwa.

877
00:30:12,206 --> 00:30:14,045
- Let's have some yakgwa.
- Yakgwa is good.

878
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:15,316
- I love yakgwa.
- Yakgwa.

879
00:30:16,016 --> 00:30:19,685
They have to eat something to come back to their senses.

880
00:30:19,686 --> 00:30:20,846
Do you want to split one?

881
00:30:20,916 --> 00:30:22,155
- Have some yakgwa.
- Do you want half?

882
00:30:22,156 --> 00:30:23,385
- Let's split it.
- Split it?

883
00:30:23,386 --> 00:30:24,755
One is too big.

884
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:25,956
I'm also hungry.

885
00:30:26,156 --> 00:30:27,225
We should cook something.

886
00:30:27,226 --> 00:30:28,325
Can you do something?

887
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,025
What should we do about lunch?

888
00:30:30,026 --> 00:30:31,225
Listen up, everyone.

889
00:30:31,226 --> 00:30:34,065
Yi Kyung's role as the chieftain is over.

890
00:30:34,066 --> 00:30:35,695
- What?
- Is it over?

891
00:30:35,696 --> 00:30:37,765
- But I didn't do anything.
- He became nothing.

892
00:30:37,766 --> 00:30:39,705
- All he did was driving.
- He was just a normal man.

893
00:30:39,706 --> 00:30:41,465
- I didn't do anything.
- "A normal man?"

894
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:42,605
- What have I done?
- You could've given orders,

895
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:44,035
but you kept helping others.

896
00:30:44,036 --> 00:30:45,876
- It turned out that way.
- All right.

897
00:30:46,006 --> 00:30:47,846
We have a chance again.

898
00:30:48,276 --> 00:30:49,875
We'll pick a new chieftain now.

899
00:30:49,876 --> 00:30:51,075
That's right.

900
00:30:51,076 --> 00:30:53,476
What I gained after putting on the stocking is over already?

901
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:54,945
Yes.

902
00:30:54,946 --> 00:30:58,116
This game is called Stealing Stools with Binoculars.

903
00:30:58,626 --> 00:30:59,826
- What?
- Binoculars?

904
00:30:59,986 --> 00:31:02,556
I guess we're doing something while wearing binoculars.

905
00:31:02,996 --> 00:31:04,496
You'll put on the binoculars...

906
00:31:05,266 --> 00:31:06,866
and dance to the music.

907
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:09,436
When you hear the sound of a whistle,

908
00:31:09,736 --> 00:31:12,366
stools will be thrown from both sides.

909
00:31:12,936 --> 00:31:14,505
Once you sit on a stool,

910
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:16,005
you'll move onto the next round.

911
00:31:16,006 --> 00:31:17,536
If not, you'll be eliminated.

912
00:31:18,036 --> 00:31:20,105
The last surviving member...

913
00:31:20,106 --> 00:31:21,846
will be the new chieftain.

914
00:31:22,676 --> 00:31:25,545
(The binoculars are given.)

915
00:31:25,546 --> 00:31:26,746
How do we put these on?

916
00:31:27,416 --> 00:31:29,086
- Aren't these microscopes?
- Hey.

917
00:31:29,586 --> 00:31:32,326
Wait a minute. I feel dizzy.

918
00:31:32,886 --> 00:31:34,225
Hey.

919
00:31:34,226 --> 00:31:35,725
(You feel dizzy?)

920
00:31:35,726 --> 00:31:36,826
I feel dizzy.

921
00:31:37,356 --> 00:31:39,466
Hey, it's impossible to see with these on.

922
00:31:39,666 --> 00:31:40,866
I feel so dizzy.

923
00:31:41,096 --> 00:31:43,256
- Do things appear big or small?
- They must look big.

924
00:31:43,536 --> 00:31:46,135
I can see hair in your nostrils through these.

925
00:31:46,136 --> 00:31:47,206
Really?

926
00:31:47,966 --> 00:31:50,836
(An object that's 5m away)

927
00:31:51,506 --> 00:31:54,906
(It looks so big that it almost looms in front of you.)

928
00:31:55,616 --> 00:31:57,516
Seung Ho is determined to become the chieftain.

929
00:31:59,186 --> 00:32:00,545
I also want to try...

930
00:32:00,546 --> 00:32:01,815
I couldn't grab it.

931
00:32:01,816 --> 00:32:02,885
What are you doing?

932
00:32:02,886 --> 00:32:04,686
- I wanted to grab it.
- Is there a mosquito?

933
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:06,755
No, I thought that this was your leg.

934
00:32:06,756 --> 00:32:07,786
I see.

935
00:32:09,026 --> 00:32:11,595
All right, shall we get started with excitement?

936
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,626
Okay.

937
00:32:12,966 --> 00:32:14,326
Music, start.

938
00:32:15,026 --> 00:32:17,436
(Three, two, one)

939
00:32:20,266 --> 00:32:22,776
(This is our song.)

940
00:32:23,306 --> 00:32:25,245
(It's an automatic reflex for Tae Hyun.)

941
00:32:25,246 --> 00:32:26,546
I forgot the choreography.

942
00:32:27,806 --> 00:32:28,915
How does it go?

943
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:30,616
(My body can't move as I learned.)

944
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,045
(His body remembers.)

945
00:32:32,046 --> 00:32:33,215
I forgot.

946
00:32:33,216 --> 00:32:34,816
(They still try hard.)

947
00:32:35,386 --> 00:32:39,486
(Lia Kim, I didn't forget.)

948
00:32:40,486 --> 00:32:42,095
(Throwing in the stools)

949
00:32:42,096 --> 00:32:43,226
Gosh, wait a minute.

950
00:32:44,626 --> 00:32:47,066
(All over the place)

951
00:32:47,766 --> 00:32:52,206
(Flailing his arms)

952
00:32:52,706 --> 00:32:54,906
- Where is it?
- What?

953
00:32:55,406 --> 00:32:56,805
(Dong Hyun's point of view from the binoculars)

954
00:32:56,806 --> 00:32:57,876
Gosh, wait.

955
00:32:59,046 --> 00:33:01,945
(He definitely saw it, but it got lost instantly.)

956
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:02,976
That won't work.

957
00:33:03,246 --> 00:33:04,376
Where is it?

958
00:33:05,946 --> 00:33:10,756
(The stools are concentrated in the middle of Handsome Guys.)

959
00:33:11,756 --> 00:33:14,725
(They run in a hurry.)

960
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:16,525
(Sitting down right away)

961
00:33:16,526 --> 00:33:17,856
- Where is it?
- What?

962
00:33:18,226 --> 00:33:19,626
(Struggling)

963
00:33:19,796 --> 00:33:22,366
(He picks it up.)

964
00:33:23,196 --> 00:33:26,906
(Each person survives in their own unique way.)

965
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:28,835
Where is it?

966
00:33:28,836 --> 00:33:30,775
(I definitely saw it. Where is it?)

967
00:33:30,776 --> 00:33:31,876
Where is it?

968
00:33:32,676 --> 00:33:33,746
Wait a minute.

969
00:33:34,276 --> 00:33:36,115
- Kim Dong Hyun is eliminated.
- Wait a minute.

970
00:33:36,116 --> 00:33:37,245
- Dong Hyun.
- Goodness.

971
00:33:37,246 --> 00:33:38,375
Is this how it works?

972
00:33:38,376 --> 00:33:39,646
Are there only four?

973
00:33:40,086 --> 00:33:41,385
I couldn't see any stools.

974
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:42,516
(Round 1 survivors)

975
00:33:42,956 --> 00:33:45,585
- Something black and red flew by.
- Exactly.

976
00:33:45,586 --> 00:33:47,285
- Then I caught it.
- After that, I couldn't see it.

977
00:33:47,286 --> 00:33:48,956
I couldn't see where it was.

978
00:33:49,726 --> 00:33:50,956
Where did it go?

979
00:33:51,626 --> 00:33:53,196
I'll be the referee now.

980
00:33:54,126 --> 00:33:56,595
He will probably throw them in a ridiculous direction.

981
00:33:56,596 --> 00:33:58,095
Don't throw them to strange places.

982
00:33:58,096 --> 00:33:59,906
I'll throw them fairly like this.

983
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:02,506
After that, I'll stand like this.

984
00:34:04,836 --> 00:34:06,846
Do we have to defeat you?

985
00:34:07,106 --> 00:34:09,246
- It's right in front of us.
- Okay.

986
00:34:09,676 --> 00:34:10,946
Please start the music.

987
00:34:12,946 --> 00:34:13,946
(Run)

988
00:34:15,046 --> 00:34:17,166
- What kind of song is this?
- Isn't it by BLACKPINK?

989
00:34:17,586 --> 00:34:19,656
I guess I'm not up to date on recent songs.

990
00:34:20,426 --> 00:34:21,426
(Just let yourself rock to the music.)

991
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:22,655
Wait. This song...

992
00:34:22,656 --> 00:34:24,095
was choreographed by Lia Kim.

993
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:26,502
(Dong Hyun lunges forward after warming up with some dancing.)

994
00:34:26,526 --> 00:34:27,995
(Rushing into the crowd)

995
00:34:27,996 --> 00:34:29,065
(Flinching)

996
00:34:29,066 --> 00:34:30,095
Wait. Did you throw it?

997
00:34:30,096 --> 00:34:31,736
- He's getting close.
- Did you throw it?

998
00:34:31,896 --> 00:34:33,666
(They're quite far away.)

999
00:34:34,106 --> 00:34:35,235
(What Sang Uk sees)

1000
00:34:35,236 --> 00:34:37,706
(Through a telescope, he seems closer.)

1001
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:38,845
Did you throw it?

1002
00:34:38,846 --> 00:34:39,976
(That was startling.)

1003
00:34:40,476 --> 00:34:44,176
(Trying to confuse them for real)

1004
00:34:44,346 --> 00:34:46,146
- I'm right in front of you.
- Where are you?

1005
00:34:46,186 --> 00:34:47,986
(Confusing, isn't it?)

1006
00:34:48,146 --> 00:34:50,066
What on earth? Something's going back and forth.

1007
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:52,185
(It's hard to tell where the stool will land.)

1008
00:34:52,186 --> 00:34:53,546
- What's going on?
- What is this?

1009
00:34:54,056 --> 00:34:55,086
Where is it?

1010
00:34:55,186 --> 00:34:56,295
Go ahead.

1011
00:34:56,296 --> 00:34:57,296
(Throwing the stools)

1012
00:34:57,456 --> 00:34:59,595
(Dong Hyun only threw two out of 3.)

1013
00:34:59,596 --> 00:35:02,535
Wait, I heard something.

1014
00:35:02,536 --> 00:35:03,536
(Tae Hyun, Sang Uk, and Yi Kyung run in the direction of the sound.)

1015
00:35:03,536 --> 00:35:04,536
I heard something.

1016
00:35:04,537 --> 00:35:05,865
(Mine)

1017
00:35:05,866 --> 00:35:08,365
(The stool disappeared from under his nose.)

1018
00:35:08,366 --> 00:35:09,876
- What?
- Where did it go?

1019
00:35:11,136 --> 00:35:14,546
(Who got the stool?)

1020
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,046
I sat on one.

1021
00:35:16,047 --> 00:35:17,976
(Yi Kyung succeeds.)

1022
00:35:18,446 --> 00:35:21,346
(Meanwhile, Seung Ho...)

1023
00:35:22,116 --> 00:35:25,555
(While three of them fight over a stool, )

1024
00:35:25,556 --> 00:35:27,555
(he manages to take one and sit in peace.)

1025
00:35:27,556 --> 00:35:28,586
What's this?

1026
00:35:29,756 --> 00:35:32,796
(Obtaining a camera)

1027
00:35:33,266 --> 00:35:34,326
There you go!

1028
00:35:34,826 --> 00:35:35,835
What on earth?

1029
00:35:35,836 --> 00:35:36,836
(The last one)

1030
00:35:37,096 --> 00:35:38,135
No!

1031
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,166
(Got you!)

1032
00:35:39,306 --> 00:35:40,835
You aren't sitting on it.

1033
00:35:40,836 --> 00:35:42,236
- Wait.
- You aren't sitting on it.

1034
00:35:42,536 --> 00:35:43,805
Who's grabbing me?

1035
00:35:43,806 --> 00:35:45,005
(A desperate battle over a stool)

1036
00:35:45,006 --> 00:35:46,006
Who's there?

1037
00:35:46,007 --> 00:35:47,246
(Tripping)

1038
00:35:47,346 --> 00:35:48,346
Who's there?

1039
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:49,846
(Sang Uk falls down.)

1040
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:52,546
(Tae Hyun manages to sit in the stool.)

1041
00:35:52,986 --> 00:35:54,046
Is there another one?

1042
00:35:54,716 --> 00:35:56,216
Find it, Sang Uk. Hurry.

1043
00:35:56,786 --> 00:35:58,215
- It's on your left.
- Where?

1044
00:35:58,216 --> 00:35:59,826
- In front of you.
- In front of me?

1045
00:36:00,256 --> 00:36:01,725
Walk a few steps ahead.

1046
00:36:01,726 --> 00:36:03,696
- How can you not see it?
- Keep going.

1047
00:36:03,926 --> 00:36:05,646
You'll have reached the camera filming you.

1048
00:36:06,426 --> 00:36:07,926
(Smiling)

1049
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:09,665
Sang Uk, you're out.

1050
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:10,836
That's a bummer.

1051
00:36:10,996 --> 00:36:13,835
(Round 3:3 people, 2 stools)

1052
00:36:13,836 --> 00:36:14,866
Play the song.

1053
00:36:15,976 --> 00:36:17,035
("Soda Pop" by Saja Boys)

1054
00:36:17,036 --> 00:36:18,106
Do you know this song?

1055
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:21,205
(Call us Handsome Boys.)

1056
00:36:21,206 --> 00:36:22,726
I don't how to see through this thing.

1057
00:36:23,146 --> 00:36:24,415
- Sang Uk, throw it.
- Me?

1058
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:25,746
One, two, three.

1059
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:27,316
Hold on.

1060
00:36:27,646 --> 00:36:28,646
You go high.

1061
00:36:28,647 --> 00:36:29,655
(Where is it?)

1062
00:36:29,656 --> 00:36:30,656
Again.

1063
00:36:30,886 --> 00:36:31,886
Now, throw!

1064
00:36:32,326 --> 00:36:34,856
(Throwing the stool as high as possible)

1065
00:36:35,896 --> 00:36:36,926
(Thud)

1066
00:36:37,026 --> 00:36:38,026
I heard it.

1067
00:36:38,027 --> 00:36:40,166
(Gathering after hearing the sound)

1068
00:36:41,396 --> 00:36:42,495
(Yi Kyung succeeds amid the chaos.)

1069
00:36:42,496 --> 00:36:43,496
Who's this?

1070
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:46,436
Let go of me.

1071
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:48,876
(Laughing)

1072
00:36:49,576 --> 00:36:50,576
(Seung Ho is trying to stop Tae Hyun.)

1073
00:36:50,577 --> 00:36:52,546
What are you holding me for?

1074
00:36:52,746 --> 00:36:54,006
- Why me?
- Where is it?

1075
00:36:54,776 --> 00:36:56,252
- Stop grabbing me.
- I'm already seated.

1076
00:36:56,276 --> 00:36:58,215
Get him. Grab Tae Hyun.

1077
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,686
(Found it!)

1078
00:37:01,346 --> 00:37:04,986
(Blocking Tae Hyun's view first)

1079
00:37:05,486 --> 00:37:06,825
(Sprinting toward the stool)

1080
00:37:06,826 --> 00:37:07,826
(Oops)

1081
00:37:09,656 --> 00:37:11,495
(Dribbling like the soccer player he used to be)

1082
00:37:11,496 --> 00:37:13,396
(Laughing)

1083
00:37:13,966 --> 00:37:15,065
(Anyway, he got the stool.)

1084
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,166
I don't know where it went.

1085
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:17,735
They all sat on one.

1086
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,436
(Tae Hyun's out.)

1087
00:37:19,466 --> 00:37:21,182
In the end, the better players came out on top.

1088
00:37:21,206 --> 00:37:23,176
- Is it Seung Ho and me again?
- It's the finals.

1089
00:37:23,476 --> 00:37:25,475
(Round 4: Finals, Yi Kyung versus Seung Ho)

1090
00:37:25,476 --> 00:37:26,976
Where are the other ones?

1091
00:37:27,576 --> 00:37:28,845
I'm going to throw all five of them,

1092
00:37:28,846 --> 00:37:30,916
but I'll mark one in advance...

1093
00:37:31,416 --> 00:37:33,096
- as the real one.
- That sounds like fun.

1094
00:37:33,146 --> 00:37:35,186
We'll need to confirm it after grabbing a stool.

1095
00:37:35,556 --> 00:37:37,055
Isn't this a penalty?

1096
00:37:37,056 --> 00:37:38,515
- How is this a valid game?
- Do we just have to sit on it?

1097
00:37:38,516 --> 00:37:39,786
(Do we have to go this far?)

1098
00:37:40,026 --> 00:37:41,325
(Out of the five stools, )

1099
00:37:41,326 --> 00:37:42,326
(find the one with the heart.)

1100
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:43,355
Cue, music.

1101
00:37:43,356 --> 00:37:45,516
(Out of the five stools, find the one with the heart.)

1102
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,835
(Awaken the dancer DNA within you.)

1103
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:51,896
What a view.

1104
00:37:52,666 --> 00:37:54,236
- This is the real one.
- Right.

1105
00:37:55,906 --> 00:38:02,476
(The master dancers have descended.)

1106
00:38:02,876 --> 00:38:04,975
(Exploding with party spirit in the heart of Yangpyeong)

1107
00:38:04,976 --> 00:38:06,046
They're good at this.

1108
00:38:09,456 --> 00:38:11,786
(Throwing all the stools)

1109
00:38:12,226 --> 00:38:15,285
(Yi Kyung moves forward quickly.)

1110
00:38:15,286 --> 00:38:16,826
(Already?)

1111
00:38:17,526 --> 00:38:20,026
(The stools came into view.)

1112
00:38:20,366 --> 00:38:23,395
(One seems to have been marked.)

1113
00:38:23,396 --> 00:38:26,166
(Dud)

1114
00:38:26,866 --> 00:38:30,336
("Dud" was written on it instead of a heart.)

1115
00:38:30,806 --> 00:38:32,176
(I bet you didn't expect that.)

1116
00:38:32,676 --> 00:38:34,005
(Seung Ho also moves toward the stools.)

1117
00:38:34,006 --> 00:38:35,086
(Kicked by Rascal Seung Ho)

1118
00:38:36,246 --> 00:38:37,275
(Seung Ho sits on a stool first.)

1119
00:38:37,276 --> 00:38:39,686
- I got it.
- What?

1120
00:38:40,186 --> 00:38:42,046
(Really?)

1121
00:38:42,516 --> 00:38:43,516
- Did you see the heart?
- Yes.

1122
00:38:43,517 --> 00:38:46,026
(Highly confident)

1123
00:38:47,186 --> 00:38:49,426
- No way. How?
- I can't believe him.

1124
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:50,626
How?

1125
00:38:50,696 --> 00:38:52,025
- Yi Kyung, sit on this one.
- There!

1126
00:38:52,026 --> 00:38:53,065
(Yi Kyung loses.)

1127
00:38:53,066 --> 00:38:54,096
How did you know?

1128
00:38:54,896 --> 00:38:56,376
- How did you know?
- Did you see it?

1129
00:38:56,666 --> 00:38:58,965
At the last second, I was given the real one,

1130
00:38:58,966 --> 00:39:00,736
and I threw it far away.

1131
00:39:01,166 --> 00:39:04,576
(Seung Ho headed toward it without hesitating.)

1132
00:39:05,006 --> 00:39:07,376
- I'll tell you how I knew. Here.
- Sure.

1133
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:10,246
Yi Kyung and I were here, right?

1134
00:39:10,676 --> 00:39:15,316
(Inspector Seung Ho and the Mystery of the Heart Stool)

1135
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:17,015
I looked for the heart...

1136
00:39:17,016 --> 00:39:18,555
and saw it on the stool that Tae Hyun was holding.

1137
00:39:18,556 --> 00:39:19,925
(At first, Tae Hyun had the heart stool.)

1138
00:39:19,926 --> 00:39:21,785
I saw it get tossed to Sang Uk.

1139
00:39:21,786 --> 00:39:22,825
(He saw Sang Uk take it.)

1140
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:24,156
We should shuffle these around.

1141
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,196
(You saw that?)

1142
00:39:30,436 --> 00:39:32,336
Sang Uk had three stools,

1143
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:34,636
and one of them had the heart.

1144
00:39:36,076 --> 00:39:38,435
Right before you threw the stools, I noticed Sang Uk only had one.

1145
00:39:38,436 --> 00:39:40,152
(Sang Uk only had two stools and neither had the heart.)

1146
00:39:40,176 --> 00:39:41,206
That means...

1147
00:39:41,876 --> 00:39:43,116
Busted, you punk!

1148
00:39:43,816 --> 00:39:44,915
But...

1149
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:46,462
(The heart stool was in Dong Hyun's hand.)

1150
00:39:46,486 --> 00:39:48,685
After the whistle was blown,

1151
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:51,186
Tae Hyun and Sang Uk threw the two they each had.

1152
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:53,726
Dong Hyun didn't and waited a while.

1153
00:39:55,426 --> 00:39:58,226
From where you're standing, it would fly in this direction.

1154
00:39:58,526 --> 00:39:59,846
That's why I looked for it there.

1155
00:40:00,566 --> 00:40:03,135
I kicked this away since it landed on the ground first.

1156
00:40:03,136 --> 00:40:05,165
And right here is where I saw the heart.

1157
00:40:05,166 --> 00:40:06,235
(He spotted the heart where he expected to see it.)

1158
00:40:06,236 --> 00:40:07,906
- No way.
- That was perfect.

1159
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:10,675
I can't believe you. From now on...

1160
00:40:10,676 --> 00:40:12,196
- That was great.
- That was so smart.

1161
00:40:12,346 --> 00:40:13,805
How can we beat someone like him?

1162
00:40:13,806 --> 00:40:14,845
Tell me about it. His intelligence is...

1163
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:15,875
- on another level.
- And as a back-up plan,

1164
00:40:15,876 --> 00:40:17,215
I grabbed the marker.

1165
00:40:17,216 --> 00:40:18,616
(Jegal Seung Ho even had a Plan B.)

1166
00:40:18,746 --> 00:40:19,815
I was going to draw a heart.

1167
00:40:19,816 --> 00:40:21,822
(How can you beat someone who was determined to win?)

1168
00:40:21,846 --> 00:40:23,716
(Mystery solved!)

1169
00:40:24,086 --> 00:40:26,156
Seung Ho came out the final winner.

1170
00:40:26,486 --> 00:40:28,826
Please hand him the armband.

1171
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:31,496
You can now enjoy the benefits of being the chieftain.

1172
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:35,165
Partner up the others and attach them by the wrists.

1173
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,166
(Rearranging the duos)

1174
00:40:36,566 --> 00:40:37,566
All right.

1175
00:40:37,567 --> 00:40:39,866
(How should I partner them up?)

1176
00:40:40,166 --> 00:40:41,266
I made up my mind.

1177
00:40:41,566 --> 00:40:43,006
(Curious)

1178
00:40:43,236 --> 00:40:44,705
- Tae Hyun and Dong Hyun.
- Whatever.

1179
00:40:44,706 --> 00:40:46,775
- Yi Kyung and Sang Uk.
- Okay.

1180
00:40:46,776 --> 00:40:52,816
(Tae Hyun and Dong Hyun, Yi Kyung and Sang Uk)

1181
00:40:53,186 --> 00:40:56,885
I'll put your teamwork to the test.

1182
00:40:56,886 --> 00:40:58,192
(Getting ready for lunch with their new partners)

1183
00:40:58,216 --> 00:41:01,355
(Tae Hyun and Dong Hyun unfold the stools.)

1184
00:41:01,356 --> 00:41:02,356
There.

1185
00:41:02,656 --> 00:41:06,266
(Yi Kyung and Sang Uk assemble the table.)

1186
00:41:07,326 --> 00:41:08,825
(Tae Hyun and Dong Hyun help each other to unfold 2 stools.)

1187
00:41:08,826 --> 00:41:10,496
- Okay, let's sit.
- Sure.

1188
00:41:10,666 --> 00:41:11,965
- Sit.
- What?

1189
00:41:11,966 --> 00:41:13,066
- Just sit.
- Are you sure?

1190
00:41:13,766 --> 00:41:17,476
(They sit down only after unfolding stools for themselves.)

1191
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,646
It's nice to be with a senior citizen.

1192
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:20,975
Why are you trying to sit with us?

1193
00:41:20,976 --> 00:41:22,046
- Just sit.
- Join us.

1194
00:41:23,176 --> 00:41:25,345
(Meanwhile, the younger brothers are working hard.)

1195
00:41:25,346 --> 00:41:27,286
Why aren't you two unfolding the stools?

1196
00:41:27,846 --> 00:41:29,556
I want to, but the elderly here...

1197
00:41:29,986 --> 00:41:30,986
told me to sit.

1198
00:41:30,987 --> 00:41:32,227
(There was nothing I could do.)

1199
00:41:32,926 --> 00:41:36,756
(Meanwhile, Sang Uk finds legs that seem to have no purpose.)

1200
00:41:37,056 --> 00:41:38,196
Sang Uk, what's that?

1201
00:41:38,726 --> 00:41:39,726
I don't know.

1202
00:41:39,727 --> 00:41:40,895
(The strange-looking item draws their attention.)

1203
00:41:40,896 --> 00:41:42,395
I don't think we'll be able to install this.

1204
00:41:42,396 --> 00:41:44,236
- What's that?
- I know what this is.

1205
00:41:44,496 --> 00:41:46,035
- Sure, go ahead.
- I know these things.

1206
00:41:46,036 --> 00:41:47,142
(Dong Hyun takes it with confidence.)

1207
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:48,565
It's for the table.

1208
00:41:48,566 --> 00:41:51,435
(A decent-looking structure is set up.)

1209
00:41:51,436 --> 00:41:54,446
- Are you sure?
- Here we go. It goes here.

1210
00:41:54,576 --> 00:41:55,746
You put these together.

1211
00:41:56,046 --> 00:41:57,075
(Assembling with ease)

1212
00:41:57,076 --> 00:41:58,116
We're good.

1213
00:41:59,386 --> 00:42:00,386
Nice.

1214
00:42:01,546 --> 00:42:04,815
(While Tae Hyun struggled)

1215
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:07,856
- I got it! I'm such a genius.
- What is it?

1216
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,495
I'm a genius.

1217
00:42:09,496 --> 00:42:10,816
- Where does it go?
- Step aside.

1218
00:42:10,996 --> 00:42:13,226
It goes right here. Look.

1219
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:16,235
Like this. Aren't I right?

1220
00:42:16,236 --> 00:42:17,735
You're right. This is where it goes.

1221
00:42:17,736 --> 00:42:18,935
(Solving any issue they had)

1222
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:20,206
- There.
- Okay.

1223
00:42:20,366 --> 00:42:22,036
I got it done.

1224
00:42:22,806 --> 00:42:23,836
It was all me.

1225
00:42:24,006 --> 00:42:25,136
He wants the credit.

1226
00:42:25,976 --> 00:42:27,346
Wait, what's this?

1227
00:42:28,076 --> 00:42:29,416
What on earth is this?

1228
00:42:30,446 --> 00:42:32,045
- What is this for?
- It's for something.

1229
00:42:32,046 --> 00:42:33,745
Something has to go here.

1230
00:42:33,746 --> 00:42:35,786
This and... Something will fit on this.

1231
00:42:36,716 --> 00:42:38,485
- Perhaps...
- Wasn't there a cast iron plate?

1232
00:42:38,486 --> 00:42:39,486
Perhaps...

1233
00:42:40,156 --> 00:42:41,886
This is the one. Right?

1234
00:42:42,556 --> 00:42:43,595
Get over there.

1235
00:42:43,596 --> 00:42:45,296
We can put anything on it.

1236
00:42:46,066 --> 00:42:47,125
This is it.

1237
00:42:47,126 --> 00:42:48,595
(All they have to do is place the container.)

1238
00:42:48,596 --> 00:42:50,096
Who'll grill the meat?

1239
00:42:50,436 --> 00:42:53,366
(Not even close)

1240
00:42:53,836 --> 00:42:55,735
(Greatly embarrassed)

1241
00:42:55,736 --> 00:42:58,805
These guys think we're matching shapes or something.

1242
00:42:58,806 --> 00:43:00,446
What fits here, then?

1243
00:43:01,306 --> 00:43:04,415
- How about this?
- Unbelievable. Let's get looking.

1244
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,092
(He desperately wants to know what fits there.)

1245
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:08,385
Over there. There's a cooler.

1246
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:09,386
(Next target, the cooler)

1247
00:43:09,616 --> 00:43:12,756
I found it. Check this out. This will fit.

1248
00:43:13,186 --> 00:43:14,385
(It gets inserted in.)

1249
00:43:14,386 --> 00:43:15,656
- See?
- Hold on.

1250
00:43:17,156 --> 00:43:18,955
- It doesn't actually fit.
- This is it.

1251
00:43:18,956 --> 00:43:19,965
(He's 99 percent sure.)

1252
00:43:19,966 --> 00:43:22,426
You hang this here and open the lid.

1253
00:43:23,166 --> 00:43:25,666
This is it. Aren't there two of these?

1254
00:43:26,236 --> 00:43:28,336
(Getting another cooler to put in the empty space)

1255
00:43:28,706 --> 00:43:30,205
- What are you doing?
- There.

1256
00:43:30,206 --> 00:43:32,676
(Surprisingly, it fits perfectly!)

1257
00:43:33,406 --> 00:43:34,406
- Okay.
- I'm dizzy.

1258
00:43:35,046 --> 00:43:36,845
Aren't we practically done?

1259
00:43:36,846 --> 00:43:37,876
Take your seats, guys.

1260
00:43:39,046 --> 00:43:42,656
(The rack is actually...)

1261
00:43:43,016 --> 00:43:46,526
(a table for placing the portable gas stove.)

1262
00:43:47,186 --> 00:43:49,896
(After solving the problem, they relax without any worry.)

1263
00:43:50,226 --> 00:43:51,455
- That's so good.
- That's so good.

1264
00:43:51,456 --> 00:43:53,826
(Simultaneously)

1265
00:43:54,096 --> 00:43:55,365
(Again, at the same time)

1266
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,965
- Why did you sigh again?
- That's odd.

1267
00:43:57,966 --> 00:44:00,406
(They prove they're the dynamic duo.)

1268
00:44:01,066 --> 00:44:02,836
Didn't you say you were hungry?

1269
00:44:03,306 --> 00:44:04,605
- Have you lost your appetite?
- We should eat.

1270
00:44:04,606 --> 00:44:06,206
- I'm hungry.
- I'm starving.

1271
00:44:06,746 --> 00:44:08,306
What do we have to do next?

1272
00:44:08,446 --> 00:44:10,675
- We'll grill some meat.
- We have to have lunch.

1273
00:44:10,676 --> 00:44:13,086
- I'll check the barbecue grill.
- Sure.

1274
00:44:13,146 --> 00:44:14,645
I'll grill the meat. I'm good at that.

1275
00:44:14,646 --> 00:44:16,155
I'll grill the meat, Dong Hyun.

1276
00:44:16,156 --> 00:44:18,055
- You?
- You two...

1277
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:19,926
must do stuff that you can.

1278
00:44:20,656 --> 00:44:22,355
Then meat,

1279
00:44:22,356 --> 00:44:24,226
stew, and I cook rice?

1280
00:44:24,256 --> 00:44:26,265
We just need to pour water and cook rice.

1281
00:44:26,266 --> 00:44:28,266
We'll pour water and cook rice.

1282
00:44:28,396 --> 00:44:30,096
- And...
- Let's go get some water.

1283
00:44:30,366 --> 00:44:31,865
Just water?

1284
00:44:31,866 --> 00:44:34,966
(Let's get moving.)

1285
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:37,375
(After the older members leave, )

1286
00:44:37,376 --> 00:44:39,256
(the younger members start cooking right away.)

1287
00:44:39,776 --> 00:44:42,405
(The chieftain fights against flying ashes and heat...)

1288
00:44:42,406 --> 00:44:44,846
(to start the fire.)

1289
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:48,045
(Yi Kyung and Sang Uk take out the ingredients...)

1290
00:44:48,046 --> 00:44:49,285
The meat... There it is.

1291
00:44:49,286 --> 00:44:50,486
(to prepare them for cooking.)

1292
00:44:50,686 --> 00:44:51,686
(Taking out the ingredients)

1293
00:44:51,687 --> 00:44:53,256
Seung Ho, what... Goodness.

1294
00:44:53,456 --> 00:44:54,756
My gosh. - Dong Hyun.

1295
00:44:55,426 --> 00:44:56,556
This isn't right.

1296
00:44:56,696 --> 00:44:58,556
- Dong Hyun, this isn't working.
- It's fine.

1297
00:44:58,826 --> 00:44:59,926
Dong Hyun.

1298
00:45:00,196 --> 00:45:01,465
It's falling apart. Take it away.

1299
00:45:01,466 --> 00:45:04,596
(It returns to its previous state in less than 10 minutes.)

1300
00:45:05,566 --> 00:45:06,905
I'll remember it for next time.

1301
00:45:06,906 --> 00:45:08,782
(Meanwhile, the older members arrive at the indoor sink.)

1302
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:10,375
- It's nice.
- My goodness.

1303
00:45:10,376 --> 00:45:11,476
It's cool in here.

1304
00:45:11,506 --> 00:45:13,246
- It's so cool.
- Goodness.

1305
00:45:13,506 --> 00:45:15,245
- It's so cool here.
- It's nice.

1306
00:45:15,246 --> 00:45:16,616
- There's a shower too.
- Look.

1307
00:45:17,246 --> 00:45:18,345
- It's so cool.
- Hey.

1308
00:45:18,346 --> 00:45:19,746
There's a changing room. Come here.

1309
00:45:20,086 --> 00:45:22,715
It's so cool here. Why is it so cool?

1310
00:45:22,716 --> 00:45:24,016
Let's lie down for a while.

1311
00:45:24,286 --> 00:45:26,486
- It's so cool.
- This is awesome.

1312
00:45:26,626 --> 00:45:27,826
Lie down.

1313
00:45:28,356 --> 00:45:30,595
(Lying down)

1314
00:45:30,596 --> 00:45:32,556
- It's amazing.
- It's so cool.

1315
00:45:32,666 --> 00:45:33,966
This is insane.

1316
00:45:34,326 --> 00:45:35,425
Tae Hyun.

1317
00:45:35,426 --> 00:45:37,335
Let us be in charge of water.

1318
00:45:37,336 --> 00:45:38,865
Tell them not to come here,

1319
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:41,705
that it's really hard to draw water.

1320
00:45:41,706 --> 00:45:43,476
My back is so cold.

1321
00:45:44,276 --> 00:45:45,576
It's so nice.

1322
00:45:46,146 --> 00:45:48,445
- Let's keep this to ourselves.
- Okay.

1323
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:50,215
(It's their secret hideout now.)

1324
00:45:50,216 --> 00:45:52,415
This is so nice. How is this place even real?

1325
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,046
(It's their secret hideout now.)

1326
00:45:55,146 --> 00:45:59,425
(Two grasshoppers are enjoying the cold massage.)

1327
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:01,856
- My back is getting too cold.
- It's so cold.

1328
00:46:04,256 --> 00:46:06,795
(Let me borrow your stomach, my friend.)

1329
00:46:06,796 --> 00:46:08,225
This is perfect.

1330
00:46:08,226 --> 00:46:09,365
It's uncomfortable.

1331
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:10,565
This is perfect.

1332
00:46:10,566 --> 00:46:11,666
(The perfect temperature)

1333
00:46:12,396 --> 00:46:13,606
My back feels so cold.

1334
00:46:14,436 --> 00:46:15,766
We should come back...

1335
00:46:15,866 --> 00:46:18,606
saying we'll go and wash lettuce.

1336
00:46:18,706 --> 00:46:19,846
We'll wash lettuce and...

1337
00:46:20,046 --> 00:46:21,645
That sounds good.

1338
00:46:21,646 --> 00:46:22,775
(My friend is the best.)

1339
00:46:22,776 --> 00:46:23,975
I love this place.

1340
00:46:23,976 --> 00:46:25,246
(My friend is the best.)

1341
00:46:25,346 --> 00:46:26,346
Let's go.

1342
00:46:26,347 --> 00:46:27,385
(They get up for now and look forward to next time.)

1343
00:46:27,386 --> 00:46:28,485
Wear your slippers.

1344
00:46:28,486 --> 00:46:30,555
(They get up for now and look forward to next time.)

1345
00:46:30,556 --> 00:46:31,715
(Shower, Changing Room)

1346
00:46:31,716 --> 00:46:33,456
- My sweat dried up.
- Nice.

1347
00:46:33,856 --> 00:46:35,426
- This is amazing.
- It's just nice.

1348
00:46:37,556 --> 00:46:38,796
Hold on.

1349
00:46:39,156 --> 00:46:41,496
- Wash your hands.
- Why?

1350
00:46:41,666 --> 00:46:43,065
We haven't washed it yet.

1351
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:45,466
(Tae Hyun does as Dong Hyun says.)

1352
00:46:46,806 --> 00:46:48,005
Come on.

1353
00:46:48,006 --> 00:46:49,535
(Wiping the water on his clothes)

1354
00:46:49,536 --> 00:46:51,256
(They're 49 and 43 years old respectively.)

1355
00:46:52,946 --> 00:46:54,845
(Tae Hyun and Dong Hyun finally start getting water.)

1356
00:46:54,846 --> 00:46:56,006
- This much?
- Yes.

1357
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:58,516
Tae Hyun. Can't I use the toilet?

1358
00:46:58,746 --> 00:46:59,885
- The toilet?
- Yes.

1359
00:46:59,886 --> 00:47:01,545
- How will you go?
- The toilet.

1360
00:47:01,546 --> 00:47:02,785
- Which is it?
- I need to pee.

1361
00:47:02,786 --> 00:47:04,385
- Darn it.
- Wait for a bit.

1362
00:47:04,386 --> 00:47:05,755
- Like this...
- I'll wait here.

1363
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:07,962
(Dong Hyun has been holding it in because he was tied up.)

1364
00:47:07,986 --> 00:47:10,655
(He tries to relieve himself with a door between them.)

1365
00:47:10,656 --> 00:47:12,096
My goodness.

1366
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:14,925
It's hard to do this with one hand because I'm wearing jeans.

1367
00:47:14,926 --> 00:47:17,166
- Try your best.
- Goodness.

1368
00:47:17,896 --> 00:47:21,135
(Tae Hyun was forced to listen to Dong Hyun...)

1369
00:47:21,136 --> 00:47:24,636
(relieve himself live.)

1370
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:27,146
- What will you use to stir-fry it?
- Okay.

1371
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:29,475
Hold on, then I can't cut...

1372
00:47:29,476 --> 00:47:30,615
(Because I'm tied.)

1373
00:47:30,616 --> 00:47:32,045
You want to cut it?

1374
00:47:32,046 --> 00:47:33,966
- I can do this.
- Can you do it using one hand?

1375
00:47:34,216 --> 00:47:36,015
(The fencer easily reaches it with his long arm.)

1376
00:47:36,016 --> 00:47:37,786
Should I use this?

1377
00:47:39,216 --> 00:47:40,985
I need to peel onions over there.

1378
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:41,986
(By the way...)

1379
00:47:41,987 --> 00:47:43,456
You need to peel onions?

1380
00:47:43,826 --> 00:47:45,525
I should tell Tae Hyun and Dong Hyun...

1381
00:47:45,526 --> 00:47:46,826
to peel some onions.

1382
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,895
(Tae Hyun and Dong Hyun come back just in time.)

1383
00:47:50,896 --> 00:47:52,436
- Dong Hyun.
- Yes?

1384
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,565
Can you go to the sink and peel some onions?

1385
00:47:54,566 --> 00:47:55,936
- Of course I can.
- Okay.

1386
00:47:56,436 --> 00:47:59,446
(They got a reason to go to their hideout.)

1387
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:01,256
- Thank you.
- We should do that at least.

1388
00:48:01,846 --> 00:48:03,352
- We should do that at least.
- Peel onions?

1389
00:48:03,376 --> 00:48:04,546
Just the skin.

1390
00:48:04,676 --> 00:48:05,775
Do I need the knife?

1391
00:48:05,776 --> 00:48:07,116
Go to the sink.

1392
00:48:07,986 --> 00:48:09,085
- Yi Kyung.
- Yes?

1393
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:10,786
You can do it here.

1394
00:48:11,156 --> 00:48:12,262
Do they need to be washed first?

1395
00:48:12,286 --> 00:48:14,325
Peel them here, then. Just don't drop them on the floor.

1396
00:48:14,326 --> 00:48:16,155
(Peel them here, then.)

1397
00:48:16,156 --> 00:48:17,255
Peel them here, then.

1398
00:48:17,256 --> 00:48:19,296
(What?)

1399
00:48:19,426 --> 00:48:20,986
- No, I'll go. Give me the knife.
- No.

1400
00:48:21,496 --> 00:48:22,996
We'll be quick.

1401
00:48:23,496 --> 00:48:24,636
The sleeping bag.

1402
00:48:24,766 --> 00:48:26,705
- Don't you need a pillow?
- A pillow?

1403
00:48:26,706 --> 00:48:28,265
Come this way.

1404
00:48:28,266 --> 00:48:30,075
- What should we do?
- We should walk behind.

1405
00:48:30,076 --> 00:48:31,176
They could see us.

1406
00:48:31,306 --> 00:48:32,806
- The front...
- That way.

1407
00:48:33,546 --> 00:48:34,576
Here.

1408
00:48:35,146 --> 00:48:36,575
How do I open it?

1409
00:48:36,576 --> 00:48:38,316
(They secretly infiltrate the tent.)

1410
00:48:38,476 --> 00:48:40,445
- That one? A sleeping bag?
- Yes, one sleeping bag.

1411
00:48:40,446 --> 00:48:41,586
- That?
- Yes.

1412
00:48:42,116 --> 00:48:44,285
(They exit casually with their eyes cast down.)

1413
00:48:44,286 --> 00:48:45,385
We need one more pillow.

1414
00:48:45,386 --> 00:48:46,526
- What?
- A pillow.

1415
00:48:46,926 --> 00:48:48,326
(Glancing)

1416
00:48:50,496 --> 00:48:52,155
It's bothersome to walk to and fro.

1417
00:48:52,156 --> 00:48:53,796
We should've brought lettuce with us too.

1418
00:48:53,896 --> 00:48:54,966
Exactly.

1419
00:48:55,996 --> 00:48:58,636
(They're back at the sink.)

1420
00:48:59,536 --> 00:49:00,566
Here.

1421
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:02,506
- It'll be quick.
- Remove the skin?

1422
00:49:02,766 --> 00:49:04,406
I'll cut them for you.

1423
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:09,776
(Extremely focused)

1424
00:49:10,376 --> 00:49:11,576
My eyes sting.

1425
00:49:12,276 --> 00:49:13,315
Give me that.

1426
00:49:13,316 --> 00:49:15,156
(They finish peeling three onions in no time.)

1427
00:49:15,646 --> 00:49:17,285
(It's time to rest in the hideout.)

1428
00:49:17,286 --> 00:49:19,626
We come here as if it was the natural course of action.

1429
00:49:20,086 --> 00:49:21,226
It's so natural.

1430
00:49:21,356 --> 00:49:26,156
(Screening Handsome, Grasshopper Friends, Part 1)

1431
00:49:26,626 --> 00:49:29,196
Tae Hyun and Dong Hyun finished peeling onions.

1432
00:49:29,736 --> 00:49:32,365
They naturally head to their hideout.

1433
00:49:32,366 --> 00:49:34,406
(Choi Soo Min, voice actress and Tae Hyun's mother)

1434
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:35,936
This is nice.

1435
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:38,736
The sleeping bag they took with them earlier.

1436
00:49:39,606 --> 00:49:42,445
They must plan to turn the hideout into their bedroom.

1437
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:43,446
(Turning the hideout into a bedroom)

1438
00:49:43,447 --> 00:49:44,976
You can't bring two at once.

1439
00:49:46,546 --> 00:49:47,816
This is amazing.

1440
00:49:47,886 --> 00:49:49,145
This... Tae Hyun.

1441
00:49:49,146 --> 00:49:50,785
- When you unzip it, it gets wider.
- Yes.

1442
00:49:50,786 --> 00:49:52,655
- We don't need two.
- You're right.

1443
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,056
Your foresight is amazing.

1444
00:49:54,156 --> 00:49:56,395
- As expected from you.
- It's me.

1445
00:49:56,396 --> 00:49:58,355
- You're smart.
- Of course.

1446
00:49:58,356 --> 00:49:59,795
You knew what would happen.

1447
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:01,665
Dong Hyun respects...

1448
00:50:01,666 --> 00:50:03,466
Tae Hyun's judgments.

1449
00:50:03,496 --> 00:50:05,736
Okay, that's it.

1450
00:50:06,606 --> 00:50:07,865
Should I put it like this?

1451
00:50:07,866 --> 00:50:09,935
They finally spread out the sleeping bag.

1452
00:50:09,936 --> 00:50:14,406
(They finally spread out the sleeping bag.)

1453
00:50:14,476 --> 00:50:15,505
- It's nice.
- Like this?

1454
00:50:15,506 --> 00:50:17,776
- It's warm.
- It's warm.

1455
00:50:18,016 --> 00:50:19,546
- Tae Hyun.
- It's perfect.

1456
00:50:19,646 --> 00:50:20,745
You can use the pillow.

1457
00:50:20,746 --> 00:50:22,515
This is perfect.

1458
00:50:22,516 --> 00:50:24,155
- This is perfect.
- It's nice.

1459
00:50:24,156 --> 00:50:25,156
(It's perfect.)

1460
00:50:25,516 --> 00:50:27,785
The two grasshoppers' paradise...

1461
00:50:27,786 --> 00:50:29,825
has been established.

1462
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:32,856
(The two grasshoppers' paradise has been established.)

1463
00:50:33,426 --> 00:50:36,795
This is just nice.

1464
00:50:36,796 --> 00:50:38,296
This is just nice.

1465
00:50:39,236 --> 00:50:40,465
This is just nice. Initially...

1466
00:50:40,466 --> 00:50:42,765
(This side is better for me.)

1467
00:50:42,766 --> 00:50:44,235
You prefer this side?

1468
00:50:44,236 --> 00:50:46,005
(This side is better for me.)

1469
00:50:46,006 --> 00:50:47,646
This side feels more comfortable.

1470
00:50:48,376 --> 00:50:49,476
If we spend...

1471
00:50:49,576 --> 00:50:52,916
too much time here, it might be too obvious.

1472
00:50:53,146 --> 00:50:54,586
Five minutes? Seven minutes?

1473
00:50:54,846 --> 00:50:56,115
- Seven minutes from now?
- Okay.

1474
00:50:56,116 --> 00:50:57,886
- That's obvious.
- Is it?

1475
00:50:58,056 --> 00:50:59,086
Three minutes from now.

1476
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,556
Three minutes? That's too short.

1477
00:51:01,756 --> 00:51:03,326
We already rested enough.

1478
00:51:03,696 --> 00:51:04,925
"What's taking them so long?"

1479
00:51:04,926 --> 00:51:06,926
Yi Kyung will definitely get suspicious.

1480
00:51:07,226 --> 00:51:08,866
- Really?
- Yes.

1481
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:11,295
Okay. Three minutes.

1482
00:51:11,296 --> 00:51:13,065
(Tae Hyun is convinced by the logical reasoning.)

1483
00:51:13,066 --> 00:51:14,136
Okay.

1484
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:15,565
(Meanwhile, the younger members...)

1485
00:51:15,566 --> 00:51:17,075
- You're good. Like this?
- Yes.

1486
00:51:17,076 --> 00:51:18,476
(Meanwhile, the younger members...)

1487
00:51:19,176 --> 00:51:23,146
(The chieftain starts grilling meat.)

1488
00:51:23,846 --> 00:51:27,716
(It already looks delicious.)

1489
00:51:28,186 --> 00:51:30,456
(Rolling it up)

1490
00:51:30,756 --> 00:51:32,415
(He rolls one whole piece of well-grilled meat.)

1491
00:51:32,416 --> 00:51:33,456
Yi Kyung.

1492
00:51:34,826 --> 00:51:35,926
Isn't it too big?

1493
00:51:36,056 --> 00:51:37,056
It isn't.

1494
00:51:37,057 --> 00:51:42,366
(The chieftain feeds his tribesman first.)

1495
00:51:43,396 --> 00:51:44,466
It's amazing.

1496
00:51:45,496 --> 00:51:47,465
This is the biggest piece of meat I've ever eaten.

1497
00:51:47,466 --> 00:51:49,312
(This is the biggest piece of meat I've ever eaten.)

1498
00:51:49,336 --> 00:51:52,036
When you eat meat, you should stuff your mouth with it.

1499
00:51:53,046 --> 00:51:55,546
(Mine is on the way too, right?)

1500
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:58,345
(Sang Uk, who worked hard to secure the meat in the supermarket!)

1501
00:51:58,346 --> 00:52:00,792
(Sang Uk, who worked hard to secure the meat in the supermarket!)

1502
00:52:00,816 --> 00:52:03,855
(The piece is as big as his hard work.)

1503
00:52:03,856 --> 00:52:06,956
(Humming)

1504
00:52:07,456 --> 00:52:10,125
(The chieftain focuses on grilling the meat while bearing the heat...)

1505
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:12,796
(even after he fed them.)

1506
00:52:13,726 --> 00:52:15,565
(Delivering the meat nonstop to the tied tribesmen)

1507
00:52:15,566 --> 00:52:16,635
Sang Uk.

1508
00:52:16,636 --> 00:52:17,795
(Delivering the meat nonstop to the tied tribesmen)

1509
00:52:17,796 --> 00:52:19,556
- This round of meat tastes good.
- My gosh.

1510
00:52:20,366 --> 00:52:21,465
This is incredible.

1511
00:52:21,466 --> 00:52:25,176
(The meat tastes incredible.)

1512
00:52:26,076 --> 00:52:29,345
(He delivers and feeds them meat as soon as he grills it.)

1513
00:52:29,346 --> 00:52:31,076
You're so good at grilling meat.

1514
00:52:31,446 --> 00:52:33,015
This tastes good as is.

1515
00:52:33,016 --> 00:52:34,145
(Thanks to the chieftain, they eat without needing to use their hands.)

1516
00:52:34,146 --> 00:52:36,486
Out of them all, there's high-quality meat.

1517
00:52:37,856 --> 00:52:39,116
Why aren't they coming back?

1518
00:52:39,726 --> 00:52:41,356
Where have they gone?

1519
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:44,656
I think they went to buy something to eat.

1520
00:52:44,726 --> 00:52:46,055
They're taking so long...

1521
00:52:46,056 --> 00:52:47,296
just to peel onions.

1522
00:52:48,766 --> 00:52:50,495
When they come back, ask them to do something else.

1523
00:52:50,496 --> 00:52:51,936
If they like it,

1524
00:52:52,166 --> 00:52:53,265
it means they were playing hooky.

1525
00:52:53,266 --> 00:52:55,746
(If they like to run errands, it means they're playing hooky.)

1526
00:52:55,866 --> 00:52:57,975
Should I ask them to wash the wrap vegetables?

1527
00:52:57,976 --> 00:52:59,105
As you eat...

1528
00:52:59,106 --> 00:53:00,445
(The younger members think ahead...)

1529
00:53:00,446 --> 00:53:02,046
(of the older members.)

1530
00:53:02,676 --> 00:53:04,375
Where are they?

1531
00:53:04,376 --> 00:53:06,216
(Are they really slacking off?)

1532
00:53:06,646 --> 00:53:08,846
(Yes, they are.)

1533
00:53:08,886 --> 00:53:10,085
It's so cool.

1534
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:11,955
(Enjoying the peace in the cool area)

1535
00:53:11,956 --> 00:53:13,256
It's cool.

1536
00:53:15,486 --> 00:53:19,025
Their eyelids feel heavy as they're lying down.

1537
00:53:19,026 --> 00:53:20,986
(Their eyelids feel heavy as they're lying down.)

1538
00:53:21,196 --> 00:53:23,835
Tae Hyun has already fallen asleep.

1539
00:53:23,836 --> 00:53:25,316
(Tae Hyun has already fallen asleep.)

1540
00:53:25,796 --> 00:53:29,006
(The air is fresh.)

1541
00:53:29,736 --> 00:53:36,576
(Resting while others work...)

1542
00:53:37,216 --> 00:53:39,015
(makes the sleep even better.)

1543
00:53:39,016 --> 00:53:42,085
My son is sleeping soundly.

1544
00:53:42,086 --> 00:53:43,416
(It makes the sleep even better.)

1545
00:53:43,816 --> 00:53:45,256
- We should go.
- What?

1546
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:46,986
Shall we?

1547
00:53:47,726 --> 00:53:48,886
Time's up.

1548
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:50,326
Okay.

1549
00:53:50,826 --> 00:53:52,825
Let's go. Three minutes is up.

1550
00:53:52,826 --> 00:53:53,926
Okay.

1551
00:53:54,966 --> 00:53:56,295
Leave this here.

1552
00:53:56,296 --> 00:53:57,635
(It's a shame to leave, but we'll come back.)

1553
00:53:57,636 --> 00:53:58,665
Later,

1554
00:53:58,666 --> 00:54:01,306
we can come back to wash lettuce.

1555
00:54:02,236 --> 00:54:04,835
(They just need to go back with peeled onions.)

1556
00:54:04,836 --> 00:54:07,746
Why are you taking so long to peel three onions?

1557
00:54:08,606 --> 00:54:11,246
Yi Kyung and Sang Uk barge in without warning.

1558
00:54:12,076 --> 00:54:15,285
Will their time at the hideout end like this?

1559
00:54:15,286 --> 00:54:17,166
(Will their time at the hideout end like this?)

1560
00:54:17,586 --> 00:54:20,725
(Screening Handsome, Grasshopper Friends, Part 2)

1561
00:54:20,726 --> 00:54:22,056
Leave this here.

1562
00:54:23,156 --> 00:54:26,566
The moment they left their sweet hideout...

1563
00:54:30,606 --> 00:54:33,036
Yi Kyung and Sang Uk come in shortly after.

1564
00:54:34,236 --> 00:54:37,075
Why are you taking so long to peel three onions?

1565
00:54:37,076 --> 00:54:38,745
- We're going now.
- What?

1566
00:54:38,746 --> 00:54:40,245
- We're going.
- What did you do?

1567
00:54:40,246 --> 00:54:41,375
I went to the toilet.

1568
00:54:41,376 --> 00:54:42,775
They're at the breaking point.

1569
00:54:42,776 --> 00:54:44,015
- This...
- Dong Hyun tries to...

1570
00:54:44,016 --> 00:54:45,246
come up with an excuse.

1571
00:54:45,286 --> 00:54:46,415
That was 20 minutes?

1572
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:48,685
- No, that was 3 or 4 minutes.
- We did our best.

1573
00:54:48,686 --> 00:54:50,302
It might be because our eyes were burning.

1574
00:54:50,326 --> 00:54:52,625
- What did you do?
- Their flustered reactions...

1575
00:54:52,626 --> 00:54:54,725
make Yi Kyung suspect them even more.

1576
00:54:54,726 --> 00:54:56,596
- No.
- We went to the toilet.

1577
00:54:57,126 --> 00:54:58,925
I used the toilet here.

1578
00:54:58,926 --> 00:55:01,165
- You took way too long.
- We started eating meat already.

1579
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:02,842
(They have circumstantial evidence but no physical evidence.)

1580
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:04,035
Watch out for the knife.

1581
00:55:04,036 --> 00:55:05,335
(The four of them leave the building.)

1582
00:55:05,336 --> 00:55:06,706
(Tapping)

1583
00:55:07,506 --> 00:55:12,305
(That was a very close call.)

1584
00:55:12,306 --> 00:55:13,346
Tae Hyun, seriously...

1585
00:55:13,746 --> 00:55:16,016
That 2 to 3 seconds difference...

1586
00:55:16,216 --> 00:55:18,045
Good job setting the alarm.

1587
00:55:18,046 --> 00:55:20,286
To prevent from looking at the changing room,

1588
00:55:20,416 --> 00:55:21,616
I blocked it with my face.

1589
00:55:23,316 --> 00:55:24,585
I told you...

1590
00:55:24,586 --> 00:55:26,856
that Yi Kyung would find it strange.

1591
00:55:27,626 --> 00:55:28,726
You were right.

1592
00:55:28,926 --> 00:55:30,726
If I didn't listen to you...

1593
00:55:31,126 --> 00:55:33,806
and set the timer to 4 minutes instead of 3, he would've caught us.

1594
00:55:33,936 --> 00:55:34,966
I...

1595
00:55:35,796 --> 00:55:37,066
There's definitely something.

1596
00:55:37,666 --> 00:55:39,036
- There's something.
- Yes.

1597
00:55:39,566 --> 00:55:41,575
Chieftain, we brought them back.

1598
00:55:41,576 --> 00:55:44,076
They're definitely hiding something, but they won't say what.

1599
00:55:44,506 --> 00:55:47,246
- No.
- He went to pee, that's why.

1600
00:55:47,776 --> 00:55:49,076
But Seung Ho.

1601
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:51,815
You keep grilling meat, so why does it look raw?

1602
00:55:51,816 --> 00:55:52,816
(Changing the conversation topic)

1603
00:55:52,817 --> 00:55:53,855
Are you eating?

1604
00:55:53,856 --> 00:55:55,255
- It looks so raw.
- To avoid any suspicion,

1605
00:55:55,256 --> 00:55:56,685
Dong Hyun changes the topic of the conversation.

1606
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,026
Where's grilled meat?

1607
00:55:58,226 --> 00:55:59,985
- Is there no cooked meat?
- Pass me the onions and knife.

1608
00:55:59,986 --> 00:56:01,495
- Hold on.
- What?

1609
00:56:01,496 --> 00:56:03,155
- You guys ate a lot.
- You ate.

1610
00:56:03,156 --> 00:56:04,265
(You guys must've eaten something.)

1611
00:56:04,266 --> 00:56:05,826
- You guys ate a lot.
- You ate.

1612
00:56:08,566 --> 00:56:10,036
Hold on. What's this?

1613
00:56:10,736 --> 00:56:12,366
- They ate so much meat.
- What's this?

1614
00:56:13,136 --> 00:56:14,575
You already ate so much?

1615
00:56:14,576 --> 00:56:15,705
(They cleared 6 out of 13 packs.)

1616
00:56:15,706 --> 00:56:16,876
- You...
- How many packs...

1617
00:56:17,046 --> 00:56:19,422
They're the ones fooling the others, but they're getting mad too.

1618
00:56:19,446 --> 00:56:20,846
- Chieftain.
- Yes?

1619
00:56:21,016 --> 00:56:22,946
These two came back too late.

1620
00:56:23,116 --> 00:56:25,945
Tell me the truth. If you do, I'll reward you.

1621
00:56:25,946 --> 00:56:27,915
(Tell me honestly. If you do, I'll reward you.)

1622
00:56:27,916 --> 00:56:29,085
- The truth?
- Yes.

1623
00:56:29,086 --> 00:56:30,326
My power as the chieftain.

1624
00:56:30,926 --> 00:56:32,355
Tell me what happened when you were gone.

1625
00:56:32,356 --> 00:56:33,755
(If you don't tell me the truth, )

1626
00:56:33,756 --> 00:56:35,556
(you won't get any meat.)

1627
00:56:36,056 --> 00:56:37,896
He needed to pee. I'm serious.

1628
00:56:38,026 --> 00:56:40,595
Tae Hyun lies throughout to keep his hideout.

1629
00:56:40,596 --> 00:56:41,736
Did he really?

1630
00:56:42,736 --> 00:56:44,735
But at that time, Dong Hyun makes a move.

1631
00:56:44,736 --> 00:56:47,176
(But at that time, Dong Hyun sees the meat and makes a move.)

1632
00:56:47,506 --> 00:56:49,305
(Dong Hyun, don't tell me...)

1633
00:56:49,306 --> 00:56:50,645
He'll spill the beans one by one.

1634
00:56:50,646 --> 00:56:53,406
Will Dong Hyun's loyalty be defeated by meat?

1635
00:56:54,716 --> 00:56:56,475
(Screening Handsome, Grasshopper Friends, Part 3)

1636
00:56:56,476 --> 00:56:57,816
- Chieftain.
- Yes?

1637
00:56:57,986 --> 00:56:59,545
These two came back too late.

1638
00:56:59,546 --> 00:57:00,755
Tell me the truth.

1639
00:57:00,756 --> 00:57:02,396
- Say what?
- If you do, I'll reward you.

1640
00:57:02,556 --> 00:57:03,755
- The truth?
- Yes.

1641
00:57:03,756 --> 00:57:04,756
- Tell me what happened.
- I mean,

1642
00:57:04,757 --> 00:57:07,396
- He needed to pee. I'm serious.
- we peeled onions.

1643
00:57:07,756 --> 00:57:10,766
Tae Hyun has never done it before.

1644
00:57:11,726 --> 00:57:12,825
Tae Hyun and Dong Hyun...

1645
00:57:12,826 --> 00:57:15,196
stayed loyal to each other as friends.

1646
00:57:16,536 --> 00:57:17,865
- Here.
- The kind chieftain...

1647
00:57:17,866 --> 00:57:20,405
- I'll let it slide once.
- decides to let it slide once.

1648
00:57:20,406 --> 00:57:21,836
(I'll let it slide once.)

1649
00:57:22,706 --> 00:57:24,846
Dong Hyun. When you eat it,

1650
00:57:25,146 --> 00:57:27,146
- you'll thank me.
- Thank you.

1651
00:57:27,516 --> 00:57:29,176
Thank you. It's grilled nicely.

1652
00:57:29,876 --> 00:57:30,885
It's nice.

1653
00:57:30,886 --> 00:57:32,385
- It's so nice.
- Right?

1654
00:57:32,386 --> 00:57:34,255
They kill 2 birds with 1 stone.

1655
00:57:34,256 --> 00:57:35,616
It's so nice.

1656
00:57:36,216 --> 00:57:39,525
(Since they had meat, they're about to sit down.)

1657
00:57:39,526 --> 00:57:40,626
Sang Uk.

1658
00:57:41,226 --> 00:57:44,026
(Seung Ho feeds the youngest one more time.)

1659
00:57:44,466 --> 00:57:46,025
- Give me one more.
- Here.

1660
00:57:46,026 --> 00:57:48,296
(Give me one more too.)

1661
00:57:50,036 --> 00:57:51,135
I'm hungry.

1662
00:57:51,136 --> 00:57:53,416
(The chieftain keeps grilling meat without sitting down.)

1663
00:57:53,536 --> 00:57:55,605
(Staring at Seung Ho)

1664
00:57:55,606 --> 00:57:58,246
Being a chieftain isn't good.

1665
00:57:58,706 --> 00:58:00,645
We're all seated, and he's the only one working.

1666
00:58:00,646 --> 00:58:02,076
Because our hands are tied.

1667
00:58:02,716 --> 00:58:04,545
There's nothing good about being a chieftain.

1668
00:58:04,546 --> 00:58:06,386
(Staff: We didn't expect this either.)

1669
00:58:07,056 --> 00:58:09,985
I'd like to ask for your help.

1670
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:10,986
Sure.

1671
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,686
Can you make one ramyeon?

1672
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:14,856
- Ramyeon sounds nice.
- Okay.

1673
00:58:15,026 --> 00:58:16,725
- We need water for ramyeon.
- Yes.

1674
00:58:16,726 --> 00:58:17,825
Let's go get water.

1675
00:58:17,826 --> 00:58:20,195
- Wait.
- What?

1676
00:58:20,196 --> 00:58:21,895
- What is in that building?
- What's in there?

1677
00:58:21,896 --> 00:58:23,665
- There's nothing.
- What's in there?

1678
00:58:23,666 --> 00:58:24,835
What would be in there?

1679
00:58:24,836 --> 00:58:27,175
- It's quite cool there.
- What's in there?

1680
00:58:27,176 --> 00:58:28,405
- The place has air con, - It's cool.

1681
00:58:28,406 --> 00:58:29,636
So it's nice and cool.

1682
00:58:30,746 --> 00:58:32,146
(Glancing)

1683
00:58:33,506 --> 00:58:35,175
What should we do? Should we rest?

1684
00:58:35,176 --> 00:58:37,246
(What should we do? Should we rest?)

1685
00:58:37,316 --> 00:58:39,436
I think Yi Kyung will come to check on us right away.

1686
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,255
- We shouldn't rest this time.
- We shouldn't.

1687
00:58:41,256 --> 00:58:42,585
(Taking a step back for the bigger picture)

1688
00:58:42,586 --> 00:58:43,856
We can rest next time.

1689
00:58:44,556 --> 00:58:49,355
(Meanwhile, the chieftain's grill is going on strong.)

1690
00:58:49,356 --> 00:58:50,995
- It's grilled.
- Can you grill this too?

1691
00:58:50,996 --> 00:58:51,996
Okay. Come here.

1692
00:58:51,997 --> 00:58:54,677
I'll give you the tastiest part before Tae Hyun and Dong Hyun come.

1693
00:58:55,896 --> 00:58:58,206
This widely spread meat is ribeye cap.

1694
00:58:58,236 --> 00:58:59,336
What on earth?

1695
00:59:00,006 --> 00:59:03,206
(How well did he grill this time?)

1696
00:59:04,246 --> 00:59:06,476
(Amazed)

1697
00:59:06,946 --> 00:59:08,415
They ate a lot.

1698
00:59:08,416 --> 00:59:10,176
(They spot the younger members eating meat!)

1699
00:59:10,746 --> 00:59:12,545
(He starts walking faster.)

1700
00:59:12,546 --> 00:59:14,516
Hey, this...

1701
00:59:15,186 --> 00:59:16,186
(He marches in with his mouth open.)

1702
00:59:16,187 --> 00:59:17,726
It melts in my mouth.

1703
00:59:19,126 --> 00:59:20,895
- I'll give you the new one.
- Yes, please.

1704
00:59:20,896 --> 00:59:22,956
(I'll give you the new one, Dong Hyun.)

1705
00:59:23,996 --> 00:59:27,436
(Toying with him)

1706
00:59:28,096 --> 00:59:29,796
Know that I gave you the tasty bit.

1707
00:59:30,766 --> 00:59:32,535
(He can definitely tell.)

1708
00:59:32,536 --> 00:59:33,566
Tae Hyun.

1709
00:59:33,776 --> 00:59:35,616
- There's more?
- It's so much more delicious.

1710
00:59:36,536 --> 00:59:38,076
I want to stop eating.

1711
00:59:39,106 --> 00:59:41,315
He keeps feeding me meat because I'm tied up.

1712
00:59:41,316 --> 00:59:44,946
Sirloin tastes really good.

1713
00:59:45,846 --> 00:59:47,956
That part of sirloin I gave you is the tasty part.

1714
00:59:47,986 --> 00:59:49,815
That's where ribeye cap is.

1715
00:59:49,816 --> 00:59:50,926
It's so good.

1716
00:59:51,786 --> 00:59:55,726
(He keeps eating meat.)

1717
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:57,895
(He acknowledges the chieftain's skills in grilling meat.)

1718
00:59:57,896 --> 00:59:59,065
You're so good at grilling meat.

1719
00:59:59,066 --> 01:00:00,942
(He acknowledges the chieftain's skills in grilling meat.)

1720
01:00:00,966 --> 01:00:02,265
I'll feed the younger ones too.

1721
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:03,435
(Now, when the meat approaches, )

1722
01:00:03,436 --> 01:00:05,936
(they stand up automatically.)

1723
01:00:06,466 --> 01:00:07,936
Like feeding baby birds.

1724
01:00:08,676 --> 01:00:09,676
Me too.

1725
01:00:09,677 --> 01:00:12,175
(Baby birds eating)

1726
01:00:12,176 --> 01:00:13,815
Being a chieftain is tiring.

1727
01:00:13,816 --> 01:00:19,286
(Being Team Handsome's chieftain is a tough job.)

1728
01:00:20,046 --> 01:00:22,516
- Stand up. Let's eat meat.
- I don't want to.

1729
01:00:22,616 --> 01:00:24,696
- I'm hungry. You should eat.
- I don't want to eat.

1730
01:00:26,026 --> 01:00:27,726
I don't want to eat!

1731
01:00:28,126 --> 01:00:29,756
I don't want to eat anymore.

1732
01:00:29,996 --> 01:00:31,565
- It's delicious.
- Tae Hyun is chewing his cud.

1733
01:00:31,566 --> 01:00:32,965
- The meat is still in his mouth.
- I'm full.

1734
01:00:32,966 --> 01:00:34,595
I won't eat. I'm full.

1735
01:00:34,596 --> 01:00:36,236
(He manages to eat another piece.)

1736
01:00:37,866 --> 01:00:39,505
(They're done being fed, so they sit back down.)

1737
01:00:39,506 --> 01:00:41,275
- The meat is so delicious.
- He's good at grilling meat.

1738
01:00:41,276 --> 01:00:42,375
It's no joke.

1739
01:00:42,376 --> 01:00:43,746
When the stew is ready,

1740
01:00:44,276 --> 01:00:45,876
we'll go and microwave instant rice.

1741
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:47,246
We'll microwave it, and...

1742
01:00:47,576 --> 01:00:49,375
- We can just use the microwave?
- Yes.

1743
01:00:49,376 --> 01:00:50,516
Okay.

1744
01:00:51,286 --> 01:00:52,586
We'll go and microwave it.

1745
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:54,116
Tae Hyun.

1746
01:00:54,586 --> 01:00:55,715
The more we take, the longer we can rest.

1747
01:00:55,716 --> 01:00:57,685
We can rest for two minutes for each pack of rice.

1748
01:00:57,686 --> 01:00:59,406
(The more we take, the longer we can rest.)

1749
01:01:00,086 --> 01:01:01,455
Ten minutes.

1750
01:01:01,456 --> 01:01:02,725
(For 6 packs of instant rice)

1751
01:01:02,726 --> 01:01:04,396
We need to microwave it.

1752
01:01:04,796 --> 01:01:06,526
It's 3 minutes 30 seconds each.

1753
01:01:07,066 --> 01:01:08,136
Okay.

1754
01:01:10,036 --> 01:01:11,665
(They quickly put the instant rice in the microwave.)

1755
01:01:11,666 --> 01:01:12,805
Luck is on our side.

1756
01:01:12,806 --> 01:01:14,236
Luck is on our side.

1757
01:01:14,706 --> 01:01:15,736
Three minutes.

1758
01:01:16,436 --> 01:01:17,506
Okay.

1759
01:01:19,746 --> 01:01:23,015
(Their 1st 3 minutes in the hideout starts.)

1760
01:01:23,016 --> 01:01:25,546
- It's so nice.
- Goodness.

1761
01:01:27,716 --> 01:01:29,155
- We'll stay...
- Yes.

1762
01:01:29,156 --> 01:01:32,226
Until the rice is ready, then we'll leave.

1763
01:01:32,956 --> 01:01:35,155
- Yes. Ten minutes.
- We can't stay longer.

1764
01:01:35,156 --> 01:01:37,166
(They're determined to be on time again.)

1765
01:01:41,036 --> 01:01:42,096
Yes.

1766
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:44,665
When we get paired up with someone else,

1767
01:01:44,666 --> 01:01:45,746
we can't come here anymore.

1768
01:01:45,866 --> 01:01:47,136
This will be our last time.

1769
01:01:48,606 --> 01:01:50,175
Just stay until they find out.

1770
01:01:50,176 --> 01:01:51,245
Okay.

1771
01:01:51,246 --> 01:01:52,766
(Let's just stay until they find out.)

1772
01:01:53,206 --> 01:01:57,546
(Now that they're prepared to be caught, they feel more at ease.)

1773
01:01:57,716 --> 01:01:59,615
(Microwave beeping)

1774
01:01:59,616 --> 01:02:01,586
That was so fast.

1775
01:02:01,856 --> 01:02:03,015
That's way too fast.

1776
01:02:03,016 --> 01:02:04,556
Three minutes is so short.

1777
01:02:04,926 --> 01:02:07,056
Next time, put 3 in and microwave them for 5 minutes.

1778
01:02:08,426 --> 01:02:09,755
You can't fit more than two inside.

1779
01:02:09,756 --> 01:02:10,966
- You can't?
- No.

1780
01:02:11,966 --> 01:02:14,595
We need to go. It's so bothersome.

1781
01:02:14,596 --> 01:02:15,835
(It's not easy to take multiple short breaks.)

1782
01:02:15,836 --> 01:02:17,266
This is the downside of it.

1783
01:02:20,036 --> 01:02:23,846
(Setting it to 3 minutes again)

1784
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:26,206
I'll bring a pillow next time.

1785
01:02:27,446 --> 01:02:29,075
I don't think there will be next time.

1786
01:02:29,076 --> 01:02:31,416
(I don't think there will be next time.)

1787
01:02:32,646 --> 01:02:35,286
It's about time Yi Kyung becomes suspicious and drops by.

1788
01:02:36,016 --> 01:02:37,556
We need to microwave...

1789
01:02:38,026 --> 01:02:40,796
multiple packs, so he can't get suspicious.

1790
01:02:42,256 --> 01:02:44,365
Does it take this long to microwave instant rice?

1791
01:02:44,366 --> 01:02:45,825
Does it take this long?

1792
01:02:45,826 --> 01:02:47,546
(But Yi Kyung is still suspicious of them.)

1793
01:02:48,236 --> 01:02:51,165
We're given ten minutes.

1794
01:02:51,166 --> 01:02:53,805
(We just need to stick to that time.)

1795
01:02:53,806 --> 01:02:55,205
(Opening)

1796
01:02:55,206 --> 01:02:56,406
Who is it?

1797
01:02:56,836 --> 01:02:58,006
- What?
- What?

1798
01:02:58,746 --> 01:03:02,046
(Just the sound of a staff member moving the equipment)

1799
01:03:02,646 --> 01:03:04,246
We did no wrong.

1800
01:03:04,586 --> 01:03:05,746
This time...

1801
01:03:06,446 --> 01:03:09,315
This time, we're given ten minutes.

1802
01:03:09,316 --> 01:03:10,996
(He got startled, but he feigns calmness.)

1803
01:03:11,726 --> 01:03:15,125
(The grasshopper friends take a break again.)

1804
01:03:15,126 --> 01:03:16,496
(Microwave beeping)

1805
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:17,726
What?

1806
01:03:18,296 --> 01:03:19,425
It's something else.

1807
01:03:19,426 --> 01:03:20,535
Is it done already?

1808
01:03:20,536 --> 01:03:22,295
(3 minutes passed quickly again.)

1809
01:03:22,296 --> 01:03:23,966
I feel like it has only been one minute.

1810
01:03:26,536 --> 01:03:28,575
I hope someone can take it out,

1811
01:03:28,576 --> 01:03:30,676
put in another one, and come back.

1812
01:03:30,876 --> 01:03:32,106
It isn't a difficult task.

1813
01:03:32,576 --> 01:03:35,676
It's a simple task, right?

1814
01:03:36,376 --> 01:03:37,615
(Can someone put in new instant rice?)

1815
01:03:37,616 --> 01:03:40,315
It's so bothersome.

1816
01:03:40,316 --> 01:03:41,316
Tae Hyun.

1817
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:44,086
They need to be cooled down anyway.

1818
01:03:44,526 --> 01:03:47,185
- They're too hot.
- One minute remains.

1819
01:03:47,186 --> 01:03:48,296
They're too hot.

1820
01:03:50,056 --> 01:03:54,696
(Let's lie down for a bit longer.)

1821
01:03:55,396 --> 01:03:56,595
The rice is ready.

1822
01:03:56,596 --> 01:03:57,965
(The production crew makes sure that they heard the beep.)

1823
01:03:57,966 --> 01:03:59,436
- We know that.
- We know that.

1824
01:04:00,106 --> 01:04:02,276
It's so bothersome. Let's go.

1825
01:04:02,606 --> 01:04:05,205
- They'll become suspicious.
- Okay. I'm so tired.

1826
01:04:05,206 --> 01:04:06,976
Seriously. I have no stamina.

1827
01:04:07,876 --> 01:04:09,876
We can use it again before they become suspicious.

1828
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,686
- Let's do it when we rinse lettuce.
- Okay.

1829
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:15,285
Our hideout must remain a secret for as long as possible.

1830
01:04:15,286 --> 01:04:18,826
(We must avoid getting caught for as long as possible.)

1831
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,495
(While the rice gets heated up, kimchi stew becomes nearly done.)

1832
01:04:21,496 --> 01:04:22,556
It smells amazing.

1833
01:04:25,826 --> 01:04:27,796
(Is it good?)

1834
01:04:29,236 --> 01:04:30,735
(I made it, but the taste is insane.)

1835
01:04:30,736 --> 01:04:32,166
- Is it good?
- It's so tasty.

1836
01:04:33,236 --> 01:04:37,276
(The assistant, Sang Uk, tastes it as well.)

1837
01:04:38,146 --> 01:04:40,046
Gosh, it's nice.

1838
01:04:41,446 --> 01:04:43,315
It tasted like a soup earlier.

1839
01:04:43,316 --> 01:04:44,545
- Now, it's a stew.
- It's coming along, right?

1840
01:04:44,546 --> 01:04:45,686
- It's a stew.
- Yes.

1841
01:04:47,786 --> 01:04:51,326
(The chieftain who worked hard tastes the stew a well.)

1842
01:04:52,186 --> 01:04:53,756
It's nice, Yi Kyung.

1843
01:04:54,456 --> 01:04:55,456
It's really nice, right?

1844
01:04:57,056 --> 01:04:58,695
It settles the stomach.

1845
01:04:58,696 --> 01:05:00,196
(It resets their stomachs.)

1846
01:05:00,836 --> 01:05:04,365
(The cooking process is almost done, so the atmosphere is peaceful.)

1847
01:05:04,366 --> 01:05:06,606
Gosh, that startled me.

1848
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:11,405
A mantis was looking at me, all ready to attack.

1849
01:05:11,406 --> 01:05:12,506
A mantis? Where?

1850
01:05:13,946 --> 01:05:17,386
(Bring it on if you dare.)

1851
01:05:18,786 --> 01:05:20,115
Even the color is different.

1852
01:05:20,116 --> 01:05:21,516
(Even the color is scary.)

1853
01:05:22,186 --> 01:05:23,186
Are you guys done?

1854
01:05:23,187 --> 01:05:24,886
(The insect catchers come back.)

1855
01:05:25,286 --> 01:05:26,725
The mantis came up.

1856
01:05:26,726 --> 01:05:28,556
Where? There it is! Dong Hyun!

1857
01:05:28,596 --> 01:05:30,225
- Gosh, it's nothing.
- Dong Hyun!

1858
01:05:30,226 --> 01:05:32,566
A mantis can't move if you grab it by its neck.

1859
01:05:34,036 --> 01:05:35,876
- Why is it so aggressive?
- You need to wait.

1860
01:05:36,266 --> 01:05:37,365
It's aggressive.

1861
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:38,835
- Dong Hyun.
- It's moving like this.

1862
01:05:38,836 --> 01:05:40,435
There it is.

1863
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:41,575
(Don't touch me.)

1864
01:05:41,576 --> 01:05:43,236
- It's throwing jabs.
- Gosh.

1865
01:05:43,876 --> 01:05:46,576
(The man who is scared of insects, Yi Kyung, becomes terrified.)

1866
01:05:46,846 --> 01:05:47,945
- Gosh.
- Look.

1867
01:05:47,946 --> 01:05:49,645
- Praying Mantis.
- Praying Mantis.

1868
01:05:49,646 --> 01:05:51,486
We used to catch them in childhood.

1869
01:05:51,986 --> 01:05:53,546
It's ready for combat.

1870
01:05:55,256 --> 01:05:57,285
- It's so aggressive.
- Dong Hyun!

1871
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,385
Dong Hyun!

1872
01:05:58,386 --> 01:05:59,825
(As soon as he finishes talking, the mantis charges toward him.)

1873
01:05:59,826 --> 01:06:01,655
A fighter like you shouldn't get so scared.

1874
01:06:01,656 --> 01:06:02,826
It's aggressive.

1875
01:06:03,356 --> 01:06:04,695
- Look.
- It's moving in to attack.

1876
01:06:04,696 --> 01:06:06,195
- Oh, my.
- What's wrong with it?

1877
01:06:06,196 --> 01:06:07,595
(Getting attacked from both sides, the fighter becomes stuck.)

1878
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:08,695
What's wrong with it?

1879
01:06:08,696 --> 01:06:09,735
- Hey.
- It's aggressive.

1880
01:06:09,736 --> 01:06:10,882
Are mantises usually like that?

1881
01:06:10,906 --> 01:06:11,906
What's wrong with it?

1882
01:06:11,907 --> 01:06:13,935
That's how mantises attack.

1883
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:15,335
I get that,

1884
01:06:15,336 --> 01:06:17,005
but do they usually approach humans to attack?

1885
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:18,345
It wants to fight. It's aggressive.

1886
01:06:18,346 --> 01:06:20,606
- Look at the way it moves.
- What's wrong with it?

1887
01:06:21,446 --> 01:06:23,545
That mantis looks a bit drunk.

1888
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:25,122
(This is a style of martial arts, Praying Mantis.)

1889
01:06:25,146 --> 01:06:27,322
Dong Hyun, didn't you say that you were going to catch it?

1890
01:06:27,346 --> 01:06:29,956
I could catch it by its neck in childhood.

1891
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:31,186
Catch it.

1892
01:06:32,386 --> 01:06:33,386
Catch it like this.

1893
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:35,325
You startled me.

1894
01:06:35,326 --> 01:06:37,055
Catch it like this.

1895
01:06:37,056 --> 01:06:38,425
- Hurry up.
- Tae Hyun, please catch it.

1896
01:06:38,426 --> 01:06:39,495
- Come on.
- For goodness' sake.

1897
01:06:39,496 --> 01:06:41,296
Old people are good at catching such insects.

1898
01:06:42,266 --> 01:06:44,465
- I got it.
- Don't catch it like that.

1899
01:06:44,466 --> 01:06:46,136
Tae Hyun, take it far.

1900
01:06:46,466 --> 01:06:49,776
(Mantis, go to Dong Hyun.)

1901
01:06:50,206 --> 01:06:51,475
(Even if you try to run, you're stuck with me.)

1902
01:06:51,476 --> 01:06:52,706
Stop it.

1903
01:06:53,246 --> 01:06:54,346
I can shoot!

1904
01:06:54,876 --> 01:06:59,015
- I can shoot!
- Seriously, stop it.

1905
01:06:59,016 --> 01:07:00,986
- I can shoot!
- It'll fly away.

1906
01:07:01,056 --> 01:07:02,156
- I can shoot!
- Seriously.

1907
01:07:02,516 --> 01:07:03,886
It'll fly away.

1908
01:07:04,056 --> 01:07:06,225
- Seriously.
- I can shoot!

1909
01:07:06,226 --> 01:07:07,456
It's listening to me.

1910
01:07:08,256 --> 01:07:09,455
- Seriously.
- It's no joke.

1911
01:07:09,456 --> 01:07:10,556
I think it'll attack.

1912
01:07:11,126 --> 01:07:12,166
Let's go over there.

1913
01:07:12,666 --> 01:07:13,666
Let's put it down.

1914
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:15,065
(He has to follow Tae Hyun even if he doesn't want to.)

1915
01:07:15,066 --> 01:07:17,166
- How is it so aggressive?
- It's so scary.

1916
01:07:18,636 --> 01:07:22,076
(Peace comes once again.)

1917
01:07:22,936 --> 01:07:24,546
Does anyone want jjajang ramyeon?

1918
01:07:25,346 --> 01:07:27,826
- I think everyone wants some.
- If you make it, we'll eat it.

1919
01:07:28,016 --> 01:07:33,216
(He works by the fire again.)

1920
01:07:33,486 --> 01:07:35,315
I think it's best to avoid becoming the chieftain.

1921
01:07:35,316 --> 01:07:37,292
(He reaches a conclusion based on what he has seen.)

1922
01:07:37,316 --> 01:07:39,625
Then I'll eat some more afterward. I'll use this.

1923
01:07:39,626 --> 01:07:41,302
(Yi Kyung begins to distribute the kimchi stew.)

1924
01:07:41,326 --> 01:07:42,326
Sang Uk, I'm sorry.

1925
01:07:42,327 --> 01:07:44,095
(Sang Uk, let me use your wrist.)

1926
01:07:44,096 --> 01:07:45,166
Look at the meat.

1927
01:07:47,366 --> 01:07:48,435
I'll give a lot of meat.

1928
01:07:48,436 --> 01:07:52,066
(A lot of solid ingredients)

1929
01:07:53,706 --> 01:07:54,835
Thank you.

1930
01:07:54,836 --> 01:07:57,336
(Tae Hyun tries the soup.)

1931
01:07:58,876 --> 01:08:00,405
- How is the stew?
- It's tasty.

1932
01:08:00,406 --> 01:08:02,676
(Gosh, it's tasty!)

1933
01:08:03,016 --> 01:08:05,816
(Dong Hyun tries the soup first.)

1934
01:08:06,216 --> 01:08:07,416
It's nice.

1935
01:08:07,816 --> 01:08:09,955
The taste is clean. It's tasty.

1936
01:08:09,956 --> 01:08:11,456
(Yi Kyung's stew is always a hit.)

1937
01:08:12,126 --> 01:08:15,355
(Tae Hyun eats the remaining meat as a side dish.)

1938
01:08:15,356 --> 01:08:17,255
I'm sorry, but I need to eat meat.

1939
01:08:17,256 --> 01:08:18,566
You're left-handed!

1940
01:08:18,796 --> 01:08:20,565
I eat with my right hand.

1941
01:08:20,566 --> 01:08:22,435
For goodness' sake! Eat with your left hand!

1942
01:08:22,436 --> 01:08:24,435
I can't use chopsticks with my left hand.

1943
01:08:24,436 --> 01:08:26,905
Why can't you do it when you're left-handed?

1944
01:08:26,906 --> 01:08:28,986
I fixed it in childhood since my grandma scolded me.

1945
01:08:30,276 --> 01:08:31,276
No way!

1946
01:08:31,277 --> 01:08:33,805
Grandmas were like that when we were young.

1947
01:08:33,806 --> 01:08:35,346
I write and eat with my right hand.

1948
01:08:35,776 --> 01:08:37,075
She watched me from the back.

1949
01:08:37,076 --> 01:08:39,345
- This is ridiculous.
- Push your hand further.

1950
01:08:39,346 --> 01:08:41,455
(They'll do this every time he gets food.)

1951
01:08:41,456 --> 01:08:44,115
I was happy because you were left-handed.

1952
01:08:44,116 --> 01:08:45,185
You don't bring any perks.

1953
01:08:45,186 --> 01:08:46,986
(He believed in Dong Hyun's left-handedness.)

1954
01:08:47,086 --> 01:08:48,566
Learn how to eat with your left hand.

1955
01:08:48,926 --> 01:08:49,926
It's too late.

1956
01:08:51,826 --> 01:08:54,665
(Let me borrow your hand once more.)

1957
01:08:54,666 --> 01:08:55,666
I need kimchi.

1958
01:08:58,406 --> 01:09:00,165
(I refuse to be the only one who is inconvenienced.)

1959
01:09:00,166 --> 01:09:01,206
What?

1960
01:09:03,936 --> 01:09:07,746
(Tae Hyun rests his arm on Dong Hyun's as he eats.)

1961
01:09:08,146 --> 01:09:09,376
That's pork neck.

1962
01:09:09,476 --> 01:09:12,086
(He removes Tae Hyun's arm since it's heavy.)

1963
01:09:12,586 --> 01:09:14,185
Pork neck... Hold on.

1964
01:09:14,186 --> 01:09:15,555
(Tae Hyun keeps putting it back.)

1965
01:09:15,556 --> 01:09:19,625
I'm trying to eat! It's heavy!

1966
01:09:19,626 --> 01:09:21,156
Then eat with your left hand.

1967
01:09:21,696 --> 01:09:22,696
It's heavy.

1968
01:09:22,697 --> 01:09:23,855
(Bickering)

1969
01:09:23,856 --> 01:09:25,226
It's heavy.

1970
01:09:26,326 --> 01:09:27,525
- Tae Hyun.
- What?

1971
01:09:27,526 --> 01:09:28,795
I feel like I'm lifting a 2kg dumbbell...

1972
01:09:28,796 --> 01:09:30,566
every time I get a spoonful of rice.

1973
01:09:31,166 --> 01:09:33,366
I'm doing this because you keep pulling my arm.

1974
01:09:34,876 --> 01:09:38,176
(Dong Hyun continues to eat despite the hardships.)

1975
01:09:38,606 --> 01:09:41,246
(Sang Uk takes a spoonful of kimchi stew.)

1976
01:09:43,876 --> 01:09:44,916
Is the stew okay?

1977
01:09:45,016 --> 01:09:47,546
(It makes his eyes go wide.)

1978
01:09:47,886 --> 01:09:49,116
It became tastier.

1979
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:55,655
(Impressed)

1980
01:09:55,656 --> 01:09:58,295
Kimchi cuts down the greasiness...

1981
01:09:58,296 --> 01:09:59,665
- of beef.
- I know.

1982
01:09:59,666 --> 01:10:01,106
- It's perfect.
- It tastes amazing.

1983
01:10:02,396 --> 01:10:04,095
I can't wait to try Yi Kyung's dish.

1984
01:10:04,096 --> 01:10:05,135
Hurry up and eat.

1985
01:10:05,136 --> 01:10:06,706
- Why don't you try it?
- Hurry up.

1986
01:10:06,766 --> 01:10:09,136
At this rate, no one will want to be the chieftain.

1987
01:10:11,276 --> 01:10:13,406
That's the responsibility of the chieftain.

1988
01:10:17,316 --> 01:10:18,616
On "The Law of Jungle,"

1989
01:10:18,686 --> 01:10:20,086
Kim Byung Man did everything.

1990
01:10:21,556 --> 01:10:23,185
- You're right.
- The chieftain has so much work.

1991
01:10:23,186 --> 01:10:25,085
(Kim Byung Man of Handsome Guys, Shin Seung Ho)

1992
01:10:25,086 --> 01:10:26,126
It's tasty.

1993
01:10:28,356 --> 01:10:30,965
- Kim Byung Man did everything.
- That's incredible.

1994
01:10:30,966 --> 01:10:35,836
(The chieftain works hard to feed the members.)

1995
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:39,005
Thank you.

1996
01:10:39,006 --> 01:10:40,006
(He even delivers food.)

1997
01:10:40,007 --> 01:10:42,436
- Chieftain is the best.
- Chieftain.

1998
01:10:42,776 --> 01:10:44,375
- Chieftain.
- Chieftain.

1999
01:10:44,376 --> 01:10:46,375
- Try some stew.
- Scoop some out.

2000
01:10:46,376 --> 01:10:47,376
(Seung Ho finally sits down.)

2001
01:10:47,377 --> 01:10:48,715
I'll try the stew first.

2002
01:10:48,716 --> 01:10:50,116
(He finally tries the kimchi stew.)

2003
01:10:50,446 --> 01:10:51,945
- I added pork neck.
- Okay.

2004
01:10:51,946 --> 01:10:55,686
(He takes a big spoonful.)

2005
01:11:00,826 --> 01:11:02,226
- It's the taste of Korea.
- Right?

2006
01:11:04,566 --> 01:11:07,625
(Now comes the jjajang ramyeon he has made with love!)

2007
01:11:07,626 --> 01:11:09,335
I thought I was full from meat, but I was mistaken.

2008
01:11:09,336 --> 01:11:10,365
I can eat a lot more.

2009
01:11:10,366 --> 01:11:12,306
- You can eat more food.
- Yes.

2010
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:18,746
(Since the meat is digested, he fills his stomach with ramyeon.)

2011
01:11:21,046 --> 01:11:24,386
(I'm finally satisfied.)

2012
01:11:25,116 --> 01:11:29,286
(Dong Hyun slurps the noodles!)

2013
01:11:30,886 --> 01:11:32,156
It's tasty.

2014
01:11:33,056 --> 01:11:34,336
Jjajang ramyeon is really tasty.

2015
01:11:35,696 --> 01:11:36,976
Jjajang ramyeon is really tasty.

2016
01:11:41,466 --> 01:11:44,406
(Impressed)

2017
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:51,946
(Oh, my!)

2018
01:11:52,876 --> 01:11:55,575
I'm full, but I can't stop eating it.

2019
01:11:55,576 --> 01:11:58,385
(Chieftain's jjajang ramyeon is irresistible.)

2020
01:11:58,386 --> 01:11:59,546
It's so tasty.

2021
01:12:02,386 --> 01:12:04,506
It has been a while since I saw Tae Hyun eat so well.

2022
01:12:04,926 --> 01:12:06,232
- You know...
- Did you finish it?

2023
01:12:06,256 --> 01:12:07,326
Yes.

2024
01:12:08,926 --> 01:12:13,126
(He empties his bowl.)

2025
01:12:14,396 --> 01:12:16,436
(Proud)

2026
01:12:16,996 --> 01:12:18,405
What are we doing next?

2027
01:12:18,406 --> 01:12:20,166
(What are we doing after mealtime?)

2028
01:12:20,406 --> 01:12:21,475
Are you done eating?

2029
01:12:21,476 --> 01:12:22,506
- Yes.
- Yes.

2030
01:12:22,806 --> 01:12:25,276
If you're done eating, we prepared an exercise class...

2031
01:12:25,546 --> 01:12:27,646
to help with digestion.

2032
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:29,836
Why don't you change into comfortable workout clothes?

2033
01:12:30,046 --> 01:12:31,916
You want us to get changed. Okay.

2034
01:12:32,686 --> 01:12:35,085
- Let's go. Where should we change?
- Where should we go?

2035
01:12:35,086 --> 01:12:38,186
You can change in the shower room down there.

2036
01:12:38,686 --> 01:12:41,696
(The shower room?)

2037
01:12:41,756 --> 01:12:44,125
Let's hurry up. We'll go first.

2038
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:45,695
- I'm full.
- Let's hurry up.

2039
01:12:45,696 --> 01:12:47,066
Why are they in a hurry?

2040
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:48,166
I'm full.

2041
01:12:48,436 --> 01:12:49,436
Where are you guys going?

2042
01:12:49,766 --> 01:12:50,896
We're going to change.

2043
01:12:51,106 --> 01:12:52,866
Where are we doing that?

2044
01:12:54,006 --> 01:12:55,436
They want us to change down there.

2045
01:12:55,906 --> 01:12:58,576
(They're suspicious.)

2046
01:12:59,376 --> 01:13:02,446
(The two grasshoppers run away.)

2047
01:13:02,646 --> 01:13:04,646
- We're going to change.
- You're going to change.

2048
01:13:09,416 --> 01:13:10,956
Who cares? I certainly don't.

2049
01:13:12,086 --> 01:13:13,525
(They lie down right away.)

2050
01:13:13,526 --> 01:13:14,995
Who cares? I certainly don't.

2051
01:13:14,996 --> 01:13:16,095
This is nice.

2052
01:13:16,096 --> 01:13:17,195
(Forget about changing.)

2053
01:13:17,196 --> 01:13:18,295
(Let's enjoy ourselves before we get caught.)

2054
01:13:18,296 --> 01:13:19,666
This is nice.

2055
01:13:20,666 --> 01:13:21,936
This is nice.

2056
01:13:22,796 --> 01:13:24,095
This is nice.

2057
01:13:24,096 --> 01:13:27,536
(They enjoy a vacation in the shower room.)

2058
01:13:27,806 --> 01:13:32,105
(We'll get caught soon, so we'll enjoy ourselves fully.)

2059
01:13:32,106 --> 01:13:33,945
(Meanwhile, the remaining members)

2060
01:13:33,946 --> 01:13:35,916
Shall we go and change then?

2061
01:13:36,716 --> 01:13:37,776
Okay.

2062
01:13:38,446 --> 01:13:41,886
(The younger ones head over to the shower room with clothes.)

2063
01:13:42,016 --> 01:13:46,126
(Not knowing anything, they remain relaxed.)

2064
01:13:46,256 --> 01:13:48,355
The changing room is attached to the shower room.

2065
01:13:48,356 --> 01:13:49,425
(They're close to the shower room!)

2066
01:13:49,426 --> 01:13:51,266
Let's get changed first.

2067
01:13:52,326 --> 01:13:54,026
(Come on!)

2068
01:13:54,696 --> 01:13:56,265
(Come on!)

2069
01:13:56,266 --> 01:13:57,935
So, you guys spent time like this.

2070
01:13:57,936 --> 01:14:00,405
(Laughing)

2071
01:14:00,406 --> 01:14:02,776
That explains why you guys took 20 minutes earlier.

2072
01:14:03,536 --> 01:14:05,105
Try lying down on the floor.

2073
01:14:05,106 --> 01:14:06,445
It's cool.

2074
01:14:06,446 --> 01:14:08,616
It's cool inside. What's up with this place?

2075
01:14:09,476 --> 01:14:10,675
You guys found out.

2076
01:14:10,676 --> 01:14:12,086
(Laughing)

2077
01:14:12,416 --> 01:14:13,786
You guys found out.

2078
01:14:13,886 --> 01:14:15,486
Welcome to the world of the married men.

2079
01:14:16,316 --> 01:14:17,386
Where are you guys going?

2080
01:14:17,856 --> 01:14:20,262
- We're going to change into pants.
- We're going to change into pants.

2081
01:14:20,286 --> 01:14:22,796
Changing into new pants takes forever.

2082
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:26,326
Shall we do a challenge? I need to empty my bladder.

2083
01:14:26,526 --> 01:14:27,725
I need to use the restroom.

2084
01:14:27,726 --> 01:14:29,126
You use the restroom so frequently.

2085
01:14:29,466 --> 01:14:31,436
How will you use the restroom?

2086
01:14:31,666 --> 01:14:33,236
How will you do that?

2087
01:14:33,906 --> 01:14:36,075
(In front of the restroom is...)

2088
01:14:36,076 --> 01:14:37,975
(a mysterious table.)

2089
01:14:37,976 --> 01:14:39,046
We're going.

2090
01:14:40,646 --> 01:14:42,046
- What? What's this?
- What's this?

2091
01:14:42,546 --> 01:14:44,075
I really need to use the restroom.

2092
01:14:44,076 --> 01:14:45,986
You need to do this to use the restroom.

2093
01:14:46,486 --> 01:14:47,615
(Table tennis balls)

2094
01:14:47,616 --> 01:14:49,816
How do we do the restroom challenge?

2095
01:14:50,756 --> 01:14:54,186
(Restroom Challenge)

2096
01:14:54,326 --> 01:14:58,996
(For the minimum amount of privacy)

2097
01:14:59,696 --> 01:15:01,195
For the minimum amount of privacy,

2098
01:15:01,196 --> 01:15:03,935
we prepared a challenge in front of the restroom.

2099
01:15:03,936 --> 01:15:05,805
If you succeed in it,

2100
01:15:05,806 --> 01:15:07,666
the bracelet will come off for five minutes.

2101
01:15:08,236 --> 01:15:09,505
(Challenge game)

2102
01:15:09,506 --> 01:15:10,952
(Throw and Receive Table Tennis Balls)

2103
01:15:10,976 --> 01:15:13,545
(Stand back to back.)

2104
01:15:13,546 --> 01:15:14,816
One, two, three.

2105
01:15:14,876 --> 01:15:16,746
(Throw...)

2106
01:15:16,916 --> 01:15:20,346
(and receive.)

2107
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:23,486
(Receive it 3 consecutive times to succeed in the challenge!)

2108
01:15:23,856 --> 01:15:25,425
- Okay.
- One person will throw.

2109
01:15:25,426 --> 01:15:26,426
- Yi Kyung, - Standing back to back...

2110
01:15:26,427 --> 01:15:27,762
I'm sure you know about my impressive dynamic visual acuity.

2111
01:15:27,786 --> 01:15:28,896
Throw it.

2112
01:15:28,926 --> 01:15:30,055
- Will you begin right away?
- Here.

2113
01:15:30,056 --> 01:15:31,416
I really need to use the restroom.

2114
01:15:32,366 --> 01:15:33,925
To use the restroom...

2115
01:15:33,926 --> 01:15:35,066
(They come out to watch.)

2116
01:15:35,736 --> 01:15:36,936
- I'll throw it.
- Okay.

2117
01:15:37,736 --> 01:15:38,736
(Throwing)

2118
01:15:42,976 --> 01:15:44,475
- What? Is this even possible?
- What about dynamic visual acuity?

2119
01:15:44,476 --> 01:15:45,505
What?

2120
01:15:45,506 --> 01:15:46,846
Throw it up high.

2121
01:15:47,206 --> 01:15:48,275
You got this.

2122
01:15:48,276 --> 01:15:49,345
Hey, this is...

2123
01:15:49,346 --> 01:15:50,876
- impossible.
- You need to look up.

2124
01:15:50,976 --> 01:15:52,046
I need to look up.

2125
01:15:52,246 --> 01:15:54,366
Yi Kyung, let's switch places. The sun is in my eyes.

2126
01:15:54,586 --> 01:15:55,885
You need to look up.

2127
01:15:55,886 --> 01:15:56,915
(They switch places since the sun is in his eyes.)

2128
01:15:56,916 --> 01:15:57,955
Yi Kyung, please say, "I'll throw it,"

2129
01:15:57,956 --> 01:15:59,286
- before you throw it.
- Okay.

2130
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:01,326
- I'll throw it.
- Okay.

2131
01:16:06,166 --> 01:16:07,765
Why are you lying to your teammate?

2132
01:16:07,766 --> 01:16:08,766
- Shall I throw it?
- Throw it.

2133
01:16:08,767 --> 01:16:10,287
(Perfect teamwork of the best friends)

2134
01:16:10,566 --> 01:16:11,766
One, two, three.

2135
01:16:15,476 --> 01:16:16,535
(He receives it.)

2136
01:16:16,536 --> 01:16:17,635
(It bounces back out.)

2137
01:16:17,636 --> 01:16:18,805
Okay.

2138
01:16:18,806 --> 01:16:20,075
One.

2139
01:16:20,076 --> 01:16:21,345
(He receives it.)

2140
01:16:21,346 --> 01:16:22,716
One, two, three.

2141
01:16:23,916 --> 01:16:26,215
(He fails right away.)

2142
01:16:26,216 --> 01:16:27,586
(Disappointed)

2143
01:16:27,786 --> 01:16:29,256
It looks easy.

2144
01:16:29,286 --> 01:16:30,715
- Do you want to try it?
- Try it.

2145
01:16:30,716 --> 01:16:32,085
(The older members tries the Restroom Challenge.)

2146
01:16:32,086 --> 01:16:34,006
- He'll poop his pants at this rate.
- Tae Hyun.

2147
01:16:34,286 --> 01:16:35,956
We'll show you how it's done. Tae Hyun.

2148
01:16:36,396 --> 01:16:37,825
- Where are you?
- Tae Hyun, I'm here.

2149
01:16:37,826 --> 01:16:39,125
- Tae Hyun, when you throw it...
- Do you see it?

2150
01:16:39,126 --> 01:16:40,165
- I see it.
- Do you see it?

2151
01:16:40,166 --> 01:16:41,635
- I can see it well.
- I'll let go. Look.

2152
01:16:41,636 --> 01:16:42,835
Look. Is it good?

2153
01:16:42,836 --> 01:16:44,135
- Will you do it like this?
- Try it.

2154
01:16:44,136 --> 01:16:45,166
Let go.

2155
01:16:45,236 --> 01:16:46,436
There we go.

2156
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:48,036
You need to throw it.

2157
01:16:48,876 --> 01:16:50,605
You didn't say that before. Was it in the rules?

2158
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:51,975
You've become more like Seung Ho.

2159
01:16:51,976 --> 01:16:53,245
(Seung Ho, the mischievous one)

2160
01:16:53,246 --> 01:16:54,675
You've spent too much time with Seung Ho.

2161
01:16:54,676 --> 01:16:55,845
It says that we need to throw it.

2162
01:16:55,846 --> 01:16:57,075
- Tae Hyun.
- Is it in the rules?

2163
01:16:57,076 --> 01:16:58,286
All right. Here.

2164
01:16:59,886 --> 01:17:00,985
Here.

2165
01:17:00,986 --> 01:17:01,986
(They continue on with the challenge.)

2166
01:17:01,987 --> 01:17:03,155
Tae Hyun, it went too far.

2167
01:17:03,156 --> 01:17:04,186
Did it go too far?

2168
01:17:04,386 --> 01:17:06,286
(Fidgeting)

2169
01:17:06,486 --> 01:17:08,126
(Sighing)

2170
01:17:08,296 --> 01:17:11,126
(This man is in a bad situation.)

2171
01:17:11,196 --> 01:17:13,326
- He's...
- We'll try it once.

2172
01:17:13,466 --> 01:17:15,236
- I'm sweating. Seriously.
- Watch.

2173
01:17:15,366 --> 01:17:16,435
I'll try it.

2174
01:17:16,436 --> 01:17:18,435
Watch. I'll give you know-how.

2175
01:17:18,436 --> 01:17:19,535
Say, "Go."

2176
01:17:19,536 --> 01:17:20,635
- You need to have the cup up here.
- Okay.

2177
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:21,705
- Try it. Set, go.
- Go.

2178
01:17:21,706 --> 01:17:23,076
(Sang Uk can't hear them.)

2179
01:17:23,636 --> 01:17:24,946
- I'll receive the ball.
- Okay.

2180
01:17:25,176 --> 01:17:26,406
- I'll throw it.
- Hurry up.

2181
01:17:26,506 --> 01:17:28,175
- Should I throw it up high?
- What?

2182
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:29,275
- Up high?
- Just throw it.

2183
01:17:29,276 --> 01:17:30,315
Was the earlier attempt okay?

2184
01:17:30,316 --> 01:17:31,386
Okay. Try it.

2185
01:17:31,846 --> 01:17:33,145
How badly do you need to go to the restroom?

2186
01:17:33,146 --> 01:17:34,346
The thing is...

2187
01:17:34,786 --> 01:17:36,185
- Do you need to go quickly?
- It'll come out if I push.

2188
01:17:36,186 --> 01:17:37,515
- Oh, no.
- You guys need to go quickly.

2189
01:17:37,516 --> 01:17:39,156
(His desperation is at 100 percent.)

2190
01:17:39,186 --> 01:17:41,102
- One, two, three.
- That's a pooping position too.

2191
01:17:41,126 --> 01:17:42,456
One, two, three.

2192
01:17:43,426 --> 01:17:44,656
- There you go.
- Good.

2193
01:17:45,826 --> 01:17:46,995
- There you go.
- Okay. We can do it.

2194
01:17:46,996 --> 01:17:48,836
This game is hard.

2195
01:17:49,166 --> 01:17:50,266
I can do it.

2196
01:17:50,566 --> 01:17:52,166
- Okay. We can do it.
- Okay.

2197
01:17:52,236 --> 01:17:53,336
I can do it.

2198
01:17:53,966 --> 01:17:55,076
It's possible.

2199
01:17:55,736 --> 01:17:57,435
Should I send it outward?

2200
01:17:57,436 --> 01:17:59,005
No, it's okay. I'll receive it no matter what.

2201
01:17:59,006 --> 01:18:00,006
(I'll receive it no matter what!)

2202
01:18:00,007 --> 01:18:02,087
(I don't want to enter the restroom stall with you!)

2203
01:18:02,376 --> 01:18:03,776
One, two, three.

2204
01:18:05,546 --> 01:18:06,886
One, two, three.

2205
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:09,056
- Oh, yes.
- That's good.

2206
01:18:09,786 --> 01:18:12,456
- Oh, yes.
- That's good.

2207
01:18:14,326 --> 01:18:16,896
(Only one ball remains!)

2208
01:18:17,056 --> 01:18:18,465
One, two, three.

2209
01:18:18,466 --> 01:18:20,365
(If Yi Kyung receives this ball, )

2210
01:18:20,366 --> 01:18:22,395
(Sang Uk will have his privacy in the restroom.)

2211
01:18:22,396 --> 01:18:23,436
He got it!

2212
01:18:23,636 --> 01:18:24,805
One, two, three.

2213
01:18:24,806 --> 01:18:25,906
He got it!

2214
01:18:30,006 --> 01:18:32,076
- He got it!
- Did he get it?

2215
01:18:32,146 --> 01:18:33,205
He got it!

2216
01:18:33,206 --> 01:18:36,046
(The master of challenges, Yi Kyung did it!)

2217
01:18:37,116 --> 01:18:38,615
The bracelet will come off for five minutes.

2218
01:18:38,616 --> 01:18:39,686
Hurry up and poop.

2219
01:18:40,146 --> 01:18:41,886
- Do you want to try it?
- Of course.

2220
01:18:42,556 --> 01:18:43,655
Hurry up and go.

2221
01:18:43,656 --> 01:18:45,826
(He hurriedly goes to spend some time alone.)

2222
01:18:46,186 --> 01:18:47,856
(I'm in a hurry.)

2223
01:18:48,596 --> 01:18:52,666
(Thus, Sang Uk successfully spends some time alone.)

2224
01:18:53,526 --> 01:18:54,836
I nearly died.

2225
01:18:55,036 --> 01:18:56,295
Shall we go?

2226
01:18:56,296 --> 01:18:57,396
Yes.

2227
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,065
(They go to the exercise class feeling comfortable.)

2228
01:18:59,066 --> 01:19:00,366
What? Are those mats for two?

2229
01:19:01,536 --> 01:19:03,106
What's this?

2230
01:19:03,506 --> 01:19:04,875
The instructor must be here.

2231
01:19:04,876 --> 01:19:07,046
(Are those yoga mats?)

2232
01:19:07,646 --> 01:19:09,645
Since you had a tasty meal,

2233
01:19:09,646 --> 01:19:10,745
you'll have an exercise class...

2234
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,446
for digestion.

2235
01:19:12,646 --> 01:19:14,216
Let's welcome the instructor.

2236
01:19:14,686 --> 01:19:16,015
Instructor.

2237
01:19:16,016 --> 01:19:17,856
(Instructor?)

2238
01:19:18,356 --> 01:19:21,055
(Someone in dark clothes approaches them.)

2239
01:19:21,056 --> 01:19:22,156
The instructor is here.

2240
01:19:23,026 --> 01:19:25,695
(Who will join them today for the exercise class?)

2241
01:19:25,696 --> 01:19:26,866
- Hello.
- What?

2242
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:29,065
- Hold on a second.
- What's this?

2243
01:19:29,066 --> 01:19:30,965
Are we having a boxing class instead of a yoga class today?

2244
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:32,036
Hyuk.

2245
01:19:32,513 --> 01:19:35,012
(Who will join them today for the exercise class?)

2246
01:19:35,013 --> 01:19:36,253
- Hello.
- What?

2247
01:19:36,983 --> 01:19:38,582
- Hold on a second.
- What's this?

2248
01:19:38,583 --> 01:19:40,352
Are we having a boxing class instead of a yoga class today?

2249
01:19:40,353 --> 01:19:41,422
Hyuk.

2250
01:19:41,423 --> 01:19:44,653
(What is he doing here?)

2251
01:19:44,793 --> 01:19:45,823
I mean...

2252
01:19:46,063 --> 01:19:47,492
- I mean...
- Hyuk.

2253
01:19:47,493 --> 01:19:48,662
- Hello.
- Hello.

2254
01:19:48,663 --> 01:19:49,992
- Hyuk.
- Hello.

2255
01:19:49,993 --> 01:19:52,402
- You're Tae Hyun's best friend.
- Hey.

2256
01:19:52,403 --> 01:19:53,763
- Aren't you warm?
- What?

2257
01:19:54,003 --> 01:19:55,432
I was camping here...

2258
01:19:55,433 --> 01:19:56,832
when I heard about the shoot.

2259
01:19:56,833 --> 01:19:58,372
That's nonsense.

2260
01:19:58,373 --> 01:20:00,302
The two best friends should wear the bracelet.

2261
01:20:00,303 --> 01:20:01,989
- That's nonsense.
- What are you guys doing?

2262
01:20:02,013 --> 01:20:04,772
We're having Shortage in Privacy.

2263
01:20:04,773 --> 01:20:06,382
We have no privacy.

2264
01:20:06,383 --> 01:20:08,983
That's why we're tied up.

2265
01:20:09,383 --> 01:20:10,982
Seung Ho is the chieftain.

2266
01:20:10,983 --> 01:20:12,523
Since I'm the chieftain,

2267
01:20:12,923 --> 01:20:14,353
I'm enjoying my freedom.

2268
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:16,193
What kind of a tribe is this?

2269
01:20:16,253 --> 01:20:17,353
Since...

2270
01:20:18,153 --> 01:20:19,222
there were exercise mats,

2271
01:20:19,223 --> 01:20:21,092
- we expected a yoga instructor.
- Same here.

2272
01:20:21,093 --> 01:20:22,869
- I also expected a yoga instructor.
- Instead, we got...

2273
01:20:22,893 --> 01:20:24,733
- the Jeet Kune Do master.
- Jeet Kune Do.

2274
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:27,333
Jang Hyuk is here as a guest for the first time in a while.

2275
01:20:28,033 --> 01:20:30,032
Now, you'll have an exercise class...

2276
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:31,772
as I explained earlier.

2277
01:20:31,773 --> 01:20:34,272
To strengthen the partners' physical and mental bond,

2278
01:20:34,273 --> 01:20:36,113
we prepared the couples' Pilates.

2279
01:20:36,443 --> 01:20:38,512
From this moment onward, Jang Hyuk will also join...

2280
01:20:38,513 --> 01:20:39,982
Shortage in Privacy.

2281
01:20:39,983 --> 01:20:41,083
- What?
- Really?

2282
01:20:41,213 --> 01:20:42,382
This is...

2283
01:20:42,383 --> 01:20:45,023
when Seung Ho's authority as the chieftain ends.

2284
01:20:45,823 --> 01:20:48,323
- What does that mean?
- He put straps around his arms.

2285
01:20:48,923 --> 01:20:50,892
Hyuk and Seung Ho will wear...

2286
01:20:50,893 --> 01:20:52,962
- the bracelet as well.
- But Hyuk...

2287
01:20:52,963 --> 01:20:54,323
Why are you guys tied together?

2288
01:20:54,363 --> 01:20:55,562
It's for Shortage in Privacy.

2289
01:20:55,563 --> 01:20:57,293
- It's for Shortage in Privacy.
- Really?

2290
01:20:57,593 --> 01:20:59,033
I should've known.

2291
01:20:59,663 --> 01:21:00,902
This is ridiculous.

2292
01:21:00,903 --> 01:21:02,102
Isn't he the instructor?

2293
01:21:02,103 --> 01:21:04,433
We have a new couple.

2294
01:21:04,573 --> 01:21:06,672
We'll now invite the instructor who will teach us...

2295
01:21:06,673 --> 01:21:08,642
the couples' Pilates. Please come on out.

2296
01:21:08,643 --> 01:21:10,373
We have a different instructor.

2297
01:21:10,513 --> 01:21:11,843
Who will it be?

2298
01:21:12,313 --> 01:21:13,742
Will we have an actual instructor?

2299
01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:15,029
- An actual instructor is here.
- What?

2300
01:21:15,053 --> 01:21:16,583
I've seen her before.

2301
01:21:16,753 --> 01:21:17,952
What?

2302
01:21:17,953 --> 01:21:19,553
- I've seen her before.
- What?

2303
01:21:20,583 --> 01:21:21,992
You guessed correctly.

2304
01:21:21,993 --> 01:21:23,453
- I see.
- You guessed correctly.

2305
01:21:24,223 --> 01:21:25,362
Eu ddeum.

2306
01:21:25,363 --> 01:21:26,523
- I know who she is.
- Hello.

2307
01:21:26,963 --> 01:21:29,132
- Shim Eu ddeum.
- Now, things won't be weird.

2308
01:21:29,133 --> 01:21:30,192
- Hello.
- It has been a while.

2309
01:21:30,193 --> 01:21:32,903
- Hello.
- Hello.

2310
01:21:34,063 --> 01:21:36,832
(Running is one of her basic skills.)

2311
01:21:36,833 --> 01:21:39,943
(She's the best in every exercise!)

2312
01:21:40,043 --> 01:21:42,973
(She's a sports entertainer who is good at everything.)

2313
01:21:43,413 --> 01:21:46,043
(The exercise instructor of the day, Shim Eu Ddeum)

2314
01:21:46,543 --> 01:21:48,212
Hello, I'm a fitness YouTuber with 1.8 million subscribers,

2315
01:21:48,213 --> 01:21:49,853
Shim Eu Ddeum.

2316
01:21:49,953 --> 01:21:52,282
(It's good to have you here.)

2317
01:21:52,283 --> 01:21:53,452
- I'm a subscriber.
- Yes.

2318
01:21:53,453 --> 01:21:56,022
Will we be able to do it when we're tied in groups of two?

2319
01:21:56,023 --> 01:21:57,252
- It won't be a problem.
- Will we be okay?

2320
01:21:57,253 --> 01:21:58,362
- Today, - Okay.

2321
01:21:58,363 --> 01:21:59,762
You'll escape from individualism.

2322
01:21:59,763 --> 01:22:01,792
- That's right.
- Teamwork is the key.

2323
01:22:01,793 --> 01:22:03,192
So, you'll help out each other...

2324
01:22:03,193 --> 01:22:05,003
- and exercise together.
- Okay.

2325
01:22:05,063 --> 01:22:06,702
I'll instruct you guys...

2326
01:22:06,703 --> 01:22:08,772
- in that direction.
- Couples' Pilates. Sounds great.

2327
01:22:08,773 --> 01:22:11,133
(Let's dive into the world of couples' Pilates right away.)

2328
01:22:16,443 --> 01:22:19,383
(Couples' Pilates with Shim Eu Ddeum)

2329
01:22:19,983 --> 01:22:22,212
Hello.

2330
01:22:22,213 --> 01:22:25,183
I'm Shim Eu Ddeum, and I will be in charge of your workout.

2331
01:22:25,383 --> 01:22:26,383
Hello.

2332
01:22:26,384 --> 01:22:27,483
- Hello.
- Hello.

2333
01:22:29,123 --> 01:22:31,322
- It's a couple workout, right?
- Yes.

2334
01:22:31,323 --> 01:22:34,063
That is why we will start with the heart stretching.

2335
01:22:34,523 --> 01:22:35,833
Get on your knees.

2336
01:22:36,333 --> 01:22:37,992
- Stay close.
- Gosh.

2337
01:22:37,993 --> 01:22:39,102
Don't stay too close.

2338
01:22:39,103 --> 01:22:40,263
Hold on.

2339
01:22:40,833 --> 01:22:42,473
Then take your partner's hand.

2340
01:22:42,873 --> 01:22:43,932
Hand?

2341
01:22:43,933 --> 01:22:46,053
(Take your partner's hand with a heart of affection.)

2342
01:22:46,173 --> 01:22:48,943
Stretch while making a pretty heart.

2343
01:22:49,513 --> 01:22:51,472
- While taking your partner's hand.
- Like this?

2344
01:22:51,473 --> 01:22:52,682
(Stretch while making a heart.)

2345
01:22:52,683 --> 01:22:53,843
Where's your hand?

2346
01:22:54,113 --> 01:22:56,582
If you move your leg a bit more to the side,

2347
01:22:56,583 --> 01:22:58,213
the stretch will feel more relieving.

2348
01:22:58,253 --> 01:22:59,382
- Their heart looks pretty.
- Like this?

2349
01:22:59,383 --> 01:23:00,682
Just make it more like a heart with your hands.

2350
01:23:00,683 --> 01:23:01,822
That's great.

2351
01:23:01,823 --> 01:23:03,252
Are our heads supposed to be like this?

2352
01:23:03,253 --> 01:23:04,322
- No!
- No?

2353
01:23:04,323 --> 01:23:05,722
(Are our heads supposed to be like this?)

2354
01:23:05,723 --> 01:23:06,822
(No!)

2355
01:23:06,823 --> 01:23:07,823
Hold on.

2356
01:23:07,824 --> 01:23:09,993
I think Tae Hyun's arms and legs are a bit short.

2357
01:23:10,193 --> 01:23:11,193
What do we do then?

2358
01:23:11,194 --> 01:23:14,332
Try to make your sides feel stretched out.

2359
01:23:14,333 --> 01:23:16,402
- I see.
- Right.

2360
01:23:16,403 --> 01:23:18,772
You must make each other feel stretched.

2361
01:23:18,773 --> 01:23:20,542
Your heads should face forward.

2362
01:23:20,543 --> 01:23:22,873
Stay comfortable as your necks feel stretched out.

2363
01:23:25,243 --> 01:23:26,243
Gosh.

2364
01:23:26,244 --> 01:23:30,412
(The new couple feels relaxed.)

2365
01:23:30,413 --> 01:23:31,973
Let's do it for the other side as well.

2366
01:23:32,383 --> 01:23:33,743
Gosh, this really feels relieving.

2367
01:23:33,823 --> 01:23:35,193
Slowly stretch out your body.

2368
01:23:35,593 --> 01:23:37,892
- Keep your legs close like this.
- We have to face each other.

2369
01:23:37,893 --> 01:23:39,723
All right. Take your partner's hands.

2370
01:23:39,993 --> 01:23:41,493
This is a flexibility test.

2371
01:23:41,623 --> 01:23:44,093
Make your feet go against each other's feet.

2372
01:23:44,863 --> 01:23:46,932
Slowly move backward with your bottom.

2373
01:23:46,933 --> 01:23:48,603
Go until your knees are straight.

2374
01:23:48,833 --> 01:23:51,302
The flexible ones can help out.

2375
01:23:51,303 --> 01:23:53,002
Your knees have to be straight, Seung Ho.

2376
01:23:53,003 --> 01:23:54,672
I still have a bit left until they are straight.

2377
01:23:54,673 --> 01:23:56,042
Hold on. I have to move a bit more.

2378
01:23:56,043 --> 01:23:57,772
- It's because...
- They're flexible.

2379
01:23:57,773 --> 01:23:59,912
Your feet must be at 90 degrees, Yi Kyung.

2380
01:23:59,913 --> 01:24:01,213
- Your feet.
- Like this.

2381
01:24:01,583 --> 01:24:03,712
One person should pull...

2382
01:24:03,713 --> 01:24:05,183
with a bit of rebound.

2383
01:24:05,553 --> 01:24:07,482
- One, two, - I'll pull you first.

2384
01:24:07,483 --> 01:24:08,652
Three, four,

2385
01:24:08,653 --> 01:24:10,222
- breathe out and five, - Look at Hyuk!

2386
01:24:10,223 --> 01:24:12,092
- six, seven, eight.
- He's so flexible.

2387
01:24:12,093 --> 01:24:13,593
- Switch.
- Three.

2388
01:24:14,393 --> 01:24:16,033
They're struggling a lot right now.

2389
01:24:16,393 --> 01:24:18,933
(What are they doing?)

2390
01:24:21,063 --> 01:24:23,002
Are those elders doing okay?

2391
01:24:23,003 --> 01:24:24,402
They're in trouble. What do we do?

2392
01:24:24,403 --> 01:24:26,272
(They're having their own gourd slicing event.)

2393
01:24:26,273 --> 01:24:27,343
My gosh!

2394
01:24:29,113 --> 01:24:30,343
Hey!

2395
01:24:31,343 --> 01:24:33,013
Five, six.

2396
01:24:33,443 --> 01:24:35,383
Get your bottoms close again.

2397
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:38,882
Your feet must be against each other. Like this.

2398
01:24:38,883 --> 01:24:41,182
- They have to be very close.
- For me to go...

2399
01:24:41,183 --> 01:24:42,452
(For me to go...)

2400
01:24:42,453 --> 01:24:43,722
That's enough.

2401
01:24:43,723 --> 01:24:46,522
(Shake it up.)

2402
01:24:46,523 --> 01:24:49,862
Together with your teamwork, stretch out your legs.

2403
01:24:49,863 --> 01:24:50,893
(Stretch out your legs.)

2404
01:24:51,233 --> 01:24:52,403
Bring them up.

2405
01:24:53,133 --> 01:24:55,303
All right. Let's go. This is it.

2406
01:24:55,633 --> 01:24:56,932
Are we doing well?

2407
01:24:56,933 --> 01:24:58,572
That's really good! Awesome!

2408
01:24:58,573 --> 01:25:00,742
I'm flexible, aren't I?

2409
01:25:00,743 --> 01:25:01,743
(Shouting)

2410
01:25:01,744 --> 01:25:03,413
Why are you two so flexible?

2411
01:25:03,843 --> 01:25:04,872
Hold on.

2412
01:25:04,873 --> 01:25:06,042
(Meanwhile, behind them...)

2413
01:25:06,043 --> 01:25:07,313
(Screaming)

2414
01:25:08,913 --> 01:25:10,752
- Hold on, guys.
- Lift your feet!

2415
01:25:10,753 --> 01:25:12,452
- He won't lift his feet.
- He has short arms.

2416
01:25:12,453 --> 01:25:13,722
- Hold on.
- He has short arms.

2417
01:25:13,723 --> 01:25:14,952
You seem to have short arms and legs.

2418
01:25:14,953 --> 01:25:16,693
Keep your neck stretched out long.

2419
01:25:16,993 --> 01:25:18,992
Your knees have to be in front of your chest.

2420
01:25:18,993 --> 01:25:20,423
There you go. Keep it like this.

2421
01:25:20,893 --> 01:25:22,062
Instructor?

2422
01:25:22,063 --> 01:25:23,492
(When do we stop?)

2423
01:25:23,493 --> 01:25:24,533
Hold on.

2424
01:25:25,503 --> 01:25:26,603
The other foot as well.

2425
01:25:26,863 --> 01:25:28,362
You can reach. There you go!

2426
01:25:28,363 --> 01:25:30,372
- We did it.
- Now, straighten your knees.

2427
01:25:30,373 --> 01:25:31,433
(Pressing)

2428
01:25:32,503 --> 01:25:34,773
Push out your chest.

2429
01:25:35,043 --> 01:25:36,443
Keep your chin down.

2430
01:25:36,743 --> 01:25:40,112
Your knees have to be straight.

2431
01:25:40,113 --> 01:25:41,683
(Destroyed)

2432
01:25:42,683 --> 01:25:44,412
- Gosh.
- We can't get along.

2433
01:25:44,413 --> 01:25:46,082
Give us more handcuffs.

2434
01:25:46,083 --> 01:25:47,652
We're not a good match!

2435
01:25:47,653 --> 01:25:49,052
I'll check these two as well.

2436
01:25:49,053 --> 01:25:50,152
You are flexible.

2437
01:25:50,153 --> 01:25:51,713
- Closer?
- I think you can get closer.

2438
01:25:51,823 --> 01:25:53,383
Straighten your knees at the same time.

2439
01:25:55,023 --> 01:25:56,832
(Pressing)

2440
01:25:56,833 --> 01:25:57,833
(Yi Kyung is not here.)

2441
01:25:57,834 --> 01:26:00,863
You have to keep your head up.

2442
01:26:02,103 --> 01:26:05,173
After that, your bottoms must go against each other.

2443
01:26:05,343 --> 01:26:07,772
- You want us to make an L, right?
- Right!

2444
01:26:07,773 --> 01:26:09,443
- Our bottoms?
- Like this?

2445
01:26:09,843 --> 01:26:11,172
(But...)

2446
01:26:11,173 --> 01:26:12,843
He just pooped.

2447
01:26:13,643 --> 01:26:16,253
(Relieved)

2448
01:26:16,583 --> 01:26:18,382
It hasn't been long since he pooped.

2449
01:26:18,383 --> 01:26:19,723
The mic hurts.

2450
01:26:20,223 --> 01:26:21,223
(Covering)

2451
01:26:21,224 --> 01:26:22,852
(Why is she covering her nose?)

2452
01:26:22,853 --> 01:26:23,952
He pooped.

2453
01:26:23,953 --> 01:26:24,953
(Come on.)

2454
01:26:24,954 --> 01:26:27,793
(Getting away)

2455
01:26:30,063 --> 01:26:31,692
Let's hurry up and do this.

2456
01:26:31,693 --> 01:26:33,063
Bring up your foot.

2457
01:26:33,363 --> 01:26:34,433
Instructor...

2458
01:26:35,573 --> 01:26:37,172
(Tae Hyun's foot came across an unpleasant spot.)

2459
01:26:37,173 --> 01:26:39,103
Your legs are too short!

2460
01:26:39,203 --> 01:26:40,973
My legs are short!

2461
01:26:41,073 --> 01:26:42,542
(It was a mistake.)

2462
01:26:42,543 --> 01:26:44,913
We're doing the advanced version.

2463
01:26:45,173 --> 01:26:46,782
(Why are they like this?)

2464
01:26:46,783 --> 01:26:47,843
Instructor!

2465
01:26:47,913 --> 01:26:50,113
He keeps using his strength!

2466
01:26:50,483 --> 01:26:52,582
Your bottoms must be on the ground.

2467
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:54,853
This couple should start as well.

2468
01:26:55,023 --> 01:26:56,823
Put your bottoms on the ground.

2469
01:26:57,253 --> 01:26:59,492
At the center, pull your ankles.

2470
01:26:59,493 --> 01:27:01,022
Strain your abs...

2471
01:27:01,023 --> 01:27:03,162
and move once to the side.

2472
01:27:03,163 --> 01:27:04,662
Not there. It's to the side.

2473
01:27:04,663 --> 01:27:06,562
- To the side.
- Let's do it like this.

2474
01:27:06,563 --> 01:27:07,632
Start!

2475
01:27:07,633 --> 01:27:09,733
Instructor! I'm going to die!

2476
01:27:11,703 --> 01:27:13,303
Gosh!

2477
01:27:14,243 --> 01:27:18,642
(A misunderstanding of "to the side")

2478
01:27:18,643 --> 01:27:19,643
Instructor!

2479
01:27:19,783 --> 01:27:20,783
(Legendary couple of rascals)

2480
01:27:20,784 --> 01:27:22,182
You two can work on your flexibility like this.

2481
01:27:22,183 --> 01:27:23,913
This is too much!

2482
01:27:24,413 --> 01:27:27,783
You two can work on your flexibility like this.

2483
01:27:28,083 --> 01:27:29,253
I'll move to this couple.

2484
01:27:29,623 --> 01:27:31,452
We'll do a total of 20 to the side.

2485
01:27:31,453 --> 01:27:33,023
You two will alternate.

2486
01:27:33,193 --> 01:27:34,863
- Keep the same rhythm.
- Gosh!

2487
01:27:34,923 --> 01:27:36,563
- Again. Strain your abs.
- Gosh!

2488
01:27:36,733 --> 01:27:37,992
- The other side.
- Gosh!

2489
01:27:37,993 --> 01:27:39,103
That was three.

2490
01:27:39,933 --> 01:27:42,003
Alternate from left to right.

2491
01:27:46,473 --> 01:27:48,102
(A gas leakage accident occurs.)

2492
01:27:48,103 --> 01:27:49,113
Gosh.

2493
01:27:50,043 --> 01:27:52,513
- They're farting over there!
- Once to this side.

2494
01:27:53,213 --> 01:27:54,812
(Who made that sound?)

2495
01:27:54,813 --> 01:27:56,052
I'm drooling.

2496
01:27:56,053 --> 01:27:59,182
(Who made the sound of a duck?)

2497
01:27:59,183 --> 01:28:00,183
(Dying of laughter)

2498
01:28:00,184 --> 01:28:02,523
It felt warm.

2499
01:28:02,593 --> 01:28:03,992
He's farting!

2500
01:28:03,993 --> 01:28:05,223
(They blame each other.)

2501
01:28:06,523 --> 01:28:08,622
(They can't work out as it's too funny.)

2502
01:28:08,623 --> 01:28:09,632
Gosh!

2503
01:28:09,633 --> 01:28:11,162
- I felt a vibration!
- Gosh!

2504
01:28:11,163 --> 01:28:12,202
(Nothing is easy for this class.)

2505
01:28:12,203 --> 01:28:13,603
I felt a vibration!

2506
01:28:13,803 --> 01:28:16,233
Stand on your feet again. We can't do anything lying down.

2507
01:28:16,803 --> 01:28:18,043
Your hands are touching, right?

2508
01:28:18,303 --> 01:28:21,373
Your backs and bottoms must be touching.

2509
01:28:21,543 --> 01:28:23,113
Take one step away from each other.

2510
01:28:23,643 --> 01:28:25,783
It will be shaped like this.

2511
01:28:25,913 --> 01:28:28,712
Keep your backs straight...

2512
01:28:28,713 --> 01:28:30,382
and slowly go down in the squat position.

2513
01:28:30,383 --> 01:28:32,683
Lift your head and bring your chin down. Down.

2514
01:28:33,053 --> 01:28:34,482
- Maintain that position.
- Maintain?

2515
01:28:34,483 --> 01:28:35,822
You have to push against him more.

2516
01:28:35,823 --> 01:28:36,992
- Right.
- This is good.

2517
01:28:36,993 --> 01:28:38,322
You two will get up while pushing against each other.

2518
01:28:38,323 --> 01:28:39,462
There you go!

2519
01:28:39,463 --> 01:28:40,692
- One, two.
- Get up.

2520
01:28:40,693 --> 01:28:42,433
- We're the aces here.
- Gosh.

2521
01:28:42,593 --> 01:28:45,163
Aren't you watching us after the count?

2522
01:28:45,233 --> 01:28:47,062
We got up really well just now.

2523
01:28:47,063 --> 01:28:48,462
All right. Try again.

2524
01:28:48,463 --> 01:28:50,133
- She left without watching.
- All right.

2525
01:28:50,373 --> 01:28:52,602
- One, two, three.
- One.

2526
01:28:52,603 --> 01:28:53,902
Do that ten times.

2527
01:28:53,903 --> 01:28:55,742
- We already did four.
- Okay.

2528
01:28:55,743 --> 01:28:57,573
- Do six more.
- Okay.

2529
01:28:57,743 --> 01:28:59,342
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

2530
01:28:59,343 --> 01:29:03,353
(The top students work harder after getting complimented by her.)

2531
01:29:03,453 --> 01:29:05,482
Take a short break after 10. You have to do 20 in total.

2532
01:29:05,483 --> 01:29:06,522
Would you like to take a look?

2533
01:29:06,523 --> 01:29:08,243
- You'll be surprised.
- Take a look at us.

2534
01:29:08,283 --> 01:29:09,592
Start. One, two.

2535
01:29:09,593 --> 01:29:11,052
(Perfect teamwork)

2536
01:29:11,053 --> 01:29:12,392
The rhythm... Gosh!

2537
01:29:12,393 --> 01:29:14,322
You'll do really well when you find the right rhythm.

2538
01:29:14,323 --> 01:29:16,092
Two. Breathe out.

2539
01:29:16,093 --> 01:29:17,732
Breathe in and breathe out.

2540
01:29:17,733 --> 01:29:19,632
(Breathing in and breathing out)

2541
01:29:19,633 --> 01:29:21,663
- They're good at this.
- The jump squat!

2542
01:29:23,873 --> 01:29:25,132
(The Yi Kyung Train goes wild.)

2543
01:29:25,133 --> 01:29:27,342
- Great!
- The weights must be a match.

2544
01:29:27,343 --> 01:29:28,543
That's great.

2545
01:29:28,703 --> 01:29:29,973
He's awesome.

2546
01:29:30,173 --> 01:29:31,942
Try it while taking each other's hands.

2547
01:29:31,943 --> 01:29:33,013
Like this?

2548
01:29:34,313 --> 01:29:35,483
Jump like this?

2549
01:29:36,283 --> 01:29:37,313
Like this?

2550
01:29:37,553 --> 01:29:39,223
This is harder to do.

2551
01:29:39,983 --> 01:29:41,523
This is harder to do.

2552
01:29:42,493 --> 01:29:43,592
What is going on?

2553
01:29:43,593 --> 01:29:46,023
- Gosh.
- That's really hard to do.

2554
01:29:46,193 --> 01:29:48,592
You two are working well together.

2555
01:29:48,593 --> 01:29:49,793
- We're a good match.
- Right.

2556
01:29:49,833 --> 01:29:52,363
He's excellent. He has great strength.

2557
01:29:52,763 --> 01:29:53,962
We did this a lot when we were young, right?

2558
01:29:53,963 --> 01:29:55,732
Locking arms and stretching each other on the back.

2559
01:29:55,733 --> 01:29:56,772
Sounds good.

2560
01:29:56,773 --> 01:29:59,079
- One person must support the other.
- Gosh, this feels nice.

2561
01:29:59,103 --> 01:30:00,642
That's good. Get on the back fully.

2562
01:30:00,643 --> 01:30:02,142
You should lie on the back.

2563
01:30:02,143 --> 01:30:03,873
Great. Relax.

2564
01:30:03,973 --> 01:30:05,742
- Okay. That's good.
- Right.

2565
01:30:05,743 --> 01:30:07,612
- Yes.
- Is this how it's done?

2566
01:30:07,613 --> 01:30:09,133
(One person doesn't look comfortable.)

2567
01:30:09,283 --> 01:30:11,812
- I'm good, aren't I?
- Yes. You are really good.

2568
01:30:11,813 --> 01:30:12,982
(They enjoyed a good stretching session.)

2569
01:30:12,983 --> 01:30:15,223
Three, two...

2570
01:30:15,383 --> 01:30:17,652
Come down slowly.

2571
01:30:17,653 --> 01:30:19,662
- Gosh, I'm sweating so much.
- That's where we'll end.

2572
01:30:19,663 --> 01:30:20,792
Let's take a picture...

2573
01:30:20,793 --> 01:30:22,163
- with a good pose.
- Okay.

2574
01:30:22,463 --> 01:30:24,862
I have to lift my leg up like you, right?

2575
01:30:24,863 --> 01:30:26,902
- Gosh, Instructor.
- Bring your arms to the front.

2576
01:30:26,903 --> 01:30:29,372
- Like this.
- What should I do?

2577
01:30:29,373 --> 01:30:30,533
This.

2578
01:30:31,273 --> 01:30:32,702
- Do that?
- Right.

2579
01:30:32,703 --> 01:30:33,942
Hold onto your thigh.

2580
01:30:33,943 --> 01:30:35,142
- Take a picture of us.
- Do this.

2581
01:30:35,143 --> 01:30:36,212
You have to jump, Yi Kyung.

2582
01:30:36,213 --> 01:30:37,773
One, two, three!

2583
01:30:42,183 --> 01:30:44,052
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

2584
01:30:44,053 --> 01:30:45,573
- Goodbye!
- That really warmed me up.

2585
01:30:46,323 --> 01:30:48,282
(The passionate couples' Pilates session comes to an end.)

2586
01:30:48,283 --> 01:30:49,393
That was awesome.

2587
01:30:51,023 --> 01:30:52,723
Gosh, my legs are sore. I can't walk!

2588
01:30:53,593 --> 01:30:55,492
Do we really have to move around with these on?

2589
01:30:55,493 --> 01:30:57,363
- Yes.
- Really?

2590
01:30:57,533 --> 01:31:00,233
(It's already time for the sun to set.)

2591
01:31:01,233 --> 01:31:03,502
The weather feels much cooler...

2592
01:31:03,503 --> 01:31:04,602
and the scenery behind looks lovely.

2593
01:31:04,603 --> 01:31:05,702
It looks beautiful.

2594
01:31:05,703 --> 01:31:07,042
(Amazed)

2595
01:31:07,043 --> 01:31:08,143
You're right.

2596
01:31:08,913 --> 01:31:11,143
- Can we not turn around then?
- No.

2597
01:31:11,243 --> 01:31:13,643
We've been looking at the concrete wall all day long.

2598
01:31:14,243 --> 01:31:15,243
(The viewers will get to see the great view.)

2599
01:31:15,244 --> 01:31:16,513
You're right about that.

2600
01:31:17,053 --> 01:31:18,053
All right.

2601
01:31:18,054 --> 01:31:20,082
After the couples' Pilates session,

2602
01:31:20,083 --> 01:31:21,983
are you all satisfied with your partners?

2603
01:31:22,823 --> 01:31:24,052
We're a great match.

2604
01:31:24,053 --> 01:31:25,923
You saw that we were the top students, right?

2605
01:31:26,293 --> 01:31:29,093
- We were the top students.
- The athletes.

2606
01:31:29,363 --> 01:31:31,663
- I want a new partner.
- What?

2607
01:31:31,863 --> 01:31:33,102
We're going to get a divorce.

2608
01:31:33,103 --> 01:31:35,002
- So...
- We want to get divorced.

2609
01:31:35,003 --> 01:31:36,523
Before we move on to the next segment,

2610
01:31:36,733 --> 01:31:38,549
you will get to decide on your partners again.

2611
01:31:38,573 --> 01:31:40,603
Each person will take turns to step forward.

2612
01:31:40,943 --> 01:31:43,243
If you wish to be a partner of the person at the front,

2613
01:31:43,573 --> 01:31:44,973
stand behind that person.

2614
01:31:45,443 --> 01:31:47,643
This feels like a dating show.

2615
01:31:48,013 --> 01:31:49,813
Are there no self-introductions?

2616
01:31:54,653 --> 01:31:56,792
(Where will their hidden hearts head toward...)

2617
01:31:56,793 --> 01:32:01,123
(amongst the locked handcuffs?)

2618
01:32:05,833 --> 01:32:09,133
(In search of a new partner)

2619
01:32:09,373 --> 01:32:14,103
(PARTNERchange)

2620
01:32:15,473 --> 01:32:16,872
Do I just stand there?

2621
01:32:16,873 --> 01:32:19,813
(First resident, Jang Hyuk)

2622
01:32:20,283 --> 01:32:22,913
(Seung Ho looks at him.)

2623
01:32:23,183 --> 01:32:25,113
Tae Hyun should go to him.

2624
01:32:25,683 --> 01:32:27,282
You two have great chemistry.

2625
01:32:27,283 --> 01:32:28,823
Me? We've been together for too long.

2626
01:32:30,053 --> 01:32:33,323
(Seung Ho feels bothered by the conversations around him.)

2627
01:32:33,563 --> 01:32:37,132
Gosh, it would feel sad to return alone with the sunset.

2628
01:32:37,133 --> 01:32:38,539
(Hyuk and Seung Ho, partners for 1 hour 3 minutes and 10 seconds)

2629
01:32:38,563 --> 01:32:39,663
Right.

2630
01:32:40,163 --> 01:32:41,862
I know how to use my brain...

2631
01:32:41,863 --> 01:32:44,232
and my body well.

2632
01:32:44,233 --> 01:32:47,702
I will be of great help...

2633
01:32:47,703 --> 01:32:49,813
when we are handcuffed together.

2634
01:32:50,273 --> 01:32:52,112
You all should know this.

2635
01:32:52,113 --> 01:32:55,413
I got the very first quiz right.

2636
01:32:55,713 --> 01:32:57,473
Didn't you end up with the penalty that day?

2637
01:32:57,783 --> 01:32:58,783
It was him.

2638
01:32:59,183 --> 01:33:01,853
I felt bad for my friend.

2639
01:33:02,083 --> 01:33:04,152
So you can use your body well.

2640
01:33:04,153 --> 01:33:06,862
But I'm not sure if there will be any advantages...

2641
01:33:06,863 --> 01:33:08,022
after becoming partners with you.

2642
01:33:08,023 --> 01:33:09,792
I expect physical limitations...

2643
01:33:09,793 --> 01:33:11,062
after being handcuffed.

2644
01:33:11,063 --> 01:33:12,862
When there are games that require physical attributes...

2645
01:33:12,863 --> 01:33:14,732
- I know how to use my body well.
- You do?

2646
01:33:14,733 --> 01:33:16,703
I did gymnastics when I was in high school.

2647
01:33:17,133 --> 01:33:18,632
- Really?
- Right.

2648
01:33:18,633 --> 01:33:20,572
- Really? Can you do this?
- Yes.

2649
01:33:20,573 --> 01:33:21,702
Can you do the handstand?

2650
01:33:21,703 --> 01:33:23,543
I can do pushups with a single finger.

2651
01:33:23,743 --> 01:33:24,772
Could you show us slightly?

2652
01:33:24,773 --> 01:33:25,782
- Really?
- Yes.

2653
01:33:25,783 --> 01:33:26,783
Will you pick me if I do it?

2654
01:33:26,784 --> 01:33:28,542
- Definitely.
- With one finger?

2655
01:33:28,543 --> 01:33:29,582
- Yes.
- That would be amazing.

2656
01:33:29,583 --> 01:33:31,182
- One finger.
- None of us can do that.

2657
01:33:31,183 --> 01:33:32,753
- Really?
- With one finger?

2658
01:33:33,883 --> 01:33:35,252
Watch carefully.

2659
01:33:35,253 --> 01:33:37,022
- See if it's just my thumb.
- Okay.

2660
01:33:37,023 --> 01:33:38,053
We have to check.

2661
01:33:38,193 --> 01:33:40,462
It's important. All right.

2662
01:33:40,463 --> 01:33:41,922
It will be amazing if he pulls it off.

2663
01:33:41,923 --> 01:33:43,462
- My hand is lifted.
- Okay.

2664
01:33:43,463 --> 01:33:45,803
- He might break his finger.
- You don't have to do this!

2665
01:33:46,203 --> 01:33:47,203
Will you be okay?

2666
01:33:48,303 --> 01:33:50,833
(He carefully gets ready.)

2667
01:33:51,403 --> 01:33:52,473
All right.

2668
01:33:52,803 --> 01:33:53,803
That doesn't make sense.

2669
01:33:53,804 --> 01:33:54,949
(Just his thumb is on the ground!)

2670
01:33:54,973 --> 01:33:56,513
(He does the pushup right away?)

2671
01:33:58,673 --> 01:34:00,643
- That's enough.
- That's enough!

2672
01:34:03,183 --> 01:34:05,452
- That's enough.
- That's enough!

2673
01:34:05,453 --> 01:34:07,623
- That's enough! Awesome.
- That's awesome.

2674
01:34:08,323 --> 01:34:09,423
Does it not hurt?

2675
01:34:09,453 --> 01:34:11,692
I did this a lot in the past.

2676
01:34:11,693 --> 01:34:15,123
- I've aged quite a bit now.
- That's amazing.

2677
01:34:15,863 --> 01:34:17,492
You must've trained...

2678
01:34:17,493 --> 01:34:19,033
so hard for that.

2679
01:34:19,603 --> 01:34:21,663
My thumb looks like this because I did it so often.

2680
01:34:21,903 --> 01:34:23,733
- What?
- It's a weapon.

2681
01:34:24,533 --> 01:34:26,372
- It's really bent.
- How is that possible?

2682
01:34:26,373 --> 01:34:27,373
(Respect)

2683
01:34:27,743 --> 01:34:29,112
- That's amazing.
- Okay.

2684
01:34:29,113 --> 01:34:30,242
- Okay.
- All right.

2685
01:34:30,243 --> 01:34:33,713
If you wish to be Hyuk's partner,

2686
01:34:34,083 --> 01:34:35,382
please step forward.

2687
01:34:35,383 --> 01:34:37,153
Take a look at this one last time.

2688
01:34:37,553 --> 01:34:40,123
Here. It's the same with this side.

2689
01:34:40,453 --> 01:34:41,523
Gosh.

2690
01:34:41,553 --> 01:34:42,792
Please step forward.

2691
01:34:42,793 --> 01:34:43,793
(It's time to make a decision.)

2692
01:34:43,794 --> 01:34:46,194
What do I do? I'm pretty sure there will be a physical game.

2693
01:34:46,623 --> 01:34:48,322
I heard footsteps.

2694
01:34:48,323 --> 01:34:49,963
(The other participants are torn.)

2695
01:34:50,733 --> 01:34:52,263
(Getting up)

2696
01:34:53,103 --> 01:34:55,333
(They all hesitate to move toward him.)

2697
01:34:55,433 --> 01:34:57,373
I will definitely go to him.

2698
01:34:58,033 --> 01:34:59,033
I'm certain.

2699
01:34:59,473 --> 01:35:01,573
There are people who look torn.

2700
01:35:01,873 --> 01:35:05,673
(Will Male 3, his best friend, head right toward him?)

2701
01:35:06,113 --> 01:35:07,473
How many people are you expecting?

2702
01:35:08,513 --> 01:35:09,652
There are two people.

2703
01:35:09,653 --> 01:35:10,813
- Two?
- Yes.

2704
01:35:11,353 --> 01:35:14,382
It's 2 or 3.

2705
01:35:14,383 --> 01:35:15,423
I'm certain there are two.

2706
01:35:15,753 --> 01:35:18,293
He's expecting two people right now.

2707
01:35:18,353 --> 01:35:19,723
You should turn around now.

2708
01:35:19,863 --> 01:35:21,663
Turn around at the count of three.

2709
01:35:22,093 --> 01:35:23,192
One, two, three.

2710
01:35:23,193 --> 01:35:24,363
I knew it!

2711
01:35:24,833 --> 01:35:25,932
One, two, three.

2712
01:35:25,933 --> 01:35:27,162
I knew it!

2713
01:35:27,163 --> 01:35:29,103
(Male 1, Jang Hyuk gets chosen by 0 people.)

2714
01:35:29,573 --> 01:35:31,772
You know how you can tell by the sound, right?

2715
01:35:31,773 --> 01:35:33,142
I sat back down.

2716
01:35:33,143 --> 01:35:35,343
It was a joke after you said you expected two people.

2717
01:35:35,703 --> 01:35:37,372
- I was actually behind you.
- Okay.

2718
01:35:37,373 --> 01:35:38,543
- He was behind you.
- Right.

2719
01:35:39,113 --> 01:35:41,442
It was just a joke.

2720
01:35:41,443 --> 01:35:42,913
All right.

2721
01:35:43,053 --> 01:35:45,823
- We have to be similar in size.
- If you wish to be his partner,

2722
01:35:45,953 --> 01:35:47,423
take his hand.

2723
01:35:47,923 --> 01:35:50,452
If not, you can turn against him.

2724
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:52,462
- I get to decide?
- Right.

2725
01:35:52,463 --> 01:35:54,023
(Male 1 gets to decide now.)

2726
01:35:54,993 --> 01:35:57,493
(What is this twist of fate?)

2727
01:35:57,933 --> 01:36:01,603
(How will this partner selection end?)

2728
01:36:01,663 --> 01:36:04,503
- We're still friends after all.
- Okay.

2729
01:36:04,873 --> 01:36:05,942
We're still friends after all.

2730
01:36:05,943 --> 01:36:08,043
(Grabbing)

2731
01:36:08,373 --> 01:36:10,043
- We can sit back down, right?
- Yes.

2732
01:36:10,643 --> 01:36:12,072
I didn't want to get in between their relationship.

2733
01:36:12,073 --> 01:36:13,142
Right.

2734
01:36:13,143 --> 01:36:14,242
These two had a strong relationship.

2735
01:36:14,243 --> 01:36:15,742
Shall we go with Dong Hyun next?

2736
01:36:15,743 --> 01:36:16,913
- Dong Hyun.
- Me?

2737
01:36:17,553 --> 01:36:20,522
- He's the main event.
- The main event.

2738
01:36:20,523 --> 01:36:21,953
Do you want to just face us?

2739
01:36:23,423 --> 01:36:25,493
What should I do?

2740
01:36:25,823 --> 01:36:27,262
Reveal your charms to us.

2741
01:36:27,263 --> 01:36:28,263
- My charms?
- Yes.

2742
01:36:28,264 --> 01:36:31,492
If I become your partner,

2743
01:36:31,493 --> 01:36:33,702
I am able to use my body well.

2744
01:36:33,703 --> 01:36:35,262
He's all about himself.

2745
01:36:35,263 --> 01:36:36,972
- Even with his body...
- No. Also,

2746
01:36:36,973 --> 01:36:39,942
I'm willing to sacrifice myself for my partner.

2747
01:36:39,943 --> 01:36:42,172
He's someone who doesn't know what sacrifice is.

2748
01:36:42,173 --> 01:36:44,012
Excuse me, sir.

2749
01:36:44,013 --> 01:36:45,712
You have a partner. Why be a hindrance?

2750
01:36:45,713 --> 01:36:47,382
- I'm trying to work here.
- He has no clue.

2751
01:36:47,383 --> 01:36:48,882
He doesn't know the definition of "sacrifice."

2752
01:36:48,883 --> 01:36:49,983
It's fine for you to come.

2753
01:36:50,253 --> 01:36:54,553
We will become a strong team when it comes to strength.

2754
01:36:54,923 --> 01:36:55,923
Right.

2755
01:36:57,093 --> 01:36:59,763
(Male 2's charms are unpredictable.)

2756
01:37:00,063 --> 01:37:02,393
You can come if you have a change of mind.

2757
01:37:02,533 --> 01:37:04,693
All right. We will begin. One, two, three.

2758
01:37:04,963 --> 01:37:06,103
Please turn around.

2759
01:37:06,263 --> 01:37:09,432
Oh, come on! Don't play any jokes.

2760
01:37:09,433 --> 01:37:11,132
While trying to be silly,

2761
01:37:11,133 --> 01:37:13,673
someone else might come and take me away.

2762
01:37:14,043 --> 01:37:15,172
(What?)

2763
01:37:15,173 --> 01:37:16,889
- What is he saying?
- I can't understand him.

2764
01:37:16,913 --> 01:37:18,542
- Please feel free to come to me.
- All right.

2765
01:37:18,543 --> 01:37:22,113
If you wish Dong Hyun to be your partner,

2766
01:37:22,483 --> 01:37:24,853
please get up and walk up to him.

2767
01:37:26,283 --> 01:37:28,223
Gosh, should I go?

2768
01:37:28,883 --> 01:37:32,123
I can sense one's presence well. I have great intuition.

2769
01:37:32,823 --> 01:37:35,863
Each of you will try to be silly.

2770
01:37:36,863 --> 01:37:37,932
(Will he...)

2771
01:37:37,933 --> 01:37:40,833
(fail to find a new partner?)

2772
01:37:41,433 --> 01:37:43,332
- All right. You can turn around.
- Yes.

2773
01:37:43,333 --> 01:37:45,173
One, two, three.

2774
01:37:49,103 --> 01:37:51,912
(Second partner change, Dong Hyun and Sang Uk)

2775
01:37:51,913 --> 01:37:53,482
We have automatically become a couple, right?

2776
01:37:53,483 --> 01:37:55,582
- They're too strong.
- We've become a couple like this.

2777
01:37:55,583 --> 01:37:57,183
Should we go out and make out?

2778
01:37:57,913 --> 01:37:59,182
- A kiss.
- A kiss.

2779
01:37:59,183 --> 01:38:00,623
(They warn of a strong celebration.)

2780
01:38:01,183 --> 01:38:02,183
Sounds good.

2781
01:38:02,184 --> 01:38:03,192
(The kiss will not be necessary.)

2782
01:38:03,193 --> 01:38:04,193
Sounds good.

2783
01:38:04,753 --> 01:38:07,122
Put on the handcuffs with your new partners.

2784
01:38:07,123 --> 01:38:08,399
(PARTNERchange, Lee Yi Kyung and Shin Seung Ho)

2785
01:38:08,423 --> 01:38:09,562
(PARTNERchange, Oh Sang Uk and Kim Dong Hyun)

2786
01:38:09,563 --> 01:38:10,563
All right.

2787
01:38:11,563 --> 01:38:13,362
It's nice that we can partner up as Hyuk is here.

2788
01:38:13,363 --> 01:38:15,083
(PARTNERchange, Jang Hyuk and Cha Tae Hyun)

2789
01:38:15,163 --> 01:38:17,272
You all seemed to have built a lot of teamwork.

2790
01:38:17,273 --> 01:38:18,672
You will play a game...

2791
01:38:18,673 --> 01:38:21,443
and you will be able to win a more convenient length.

2792
01:38:22,073 --> 01:38:23,413
The length of the links?

2793
01:38:23,713 --> 01:38:25,913
- So this was why it was like this.
- I see.

2794
01:38:26,743 --> 01:38:29,453
The winning team will be given 50cm.

2795
01:38:30,083 --> 01:38:32,153
The team in second will be given 30cm.

2796
01:38:33,123 --> 01:38:35,623
- That's a reasonable length.
- Not bad.

2797
01:38:36,193 --> 01:38:37,923
But the team in last place...

2798
01:38:38,093 --> 01:38:41,722
(There's more?)

2799
01:38:41,723 --> 01:38:44,332
will be forced to build more teamwork...

2800
01:38:44,333 --> 01:38:46,203
and the legs will be tied as well.

2801
01:38:47,003 --> 01:38:48,379
- What?
- Like for a three-legged race?

2802
01:38:48,403 --> 01:38:49,472
Right.

2803
01:38:49,473 --> 01:38:50,502
Gosh.

2804
01:38:50,503 --> 01:38:51,802
That will be really uncomfortable.

2805
01:38:51,803 --> 01:38:53,503
(In despair)

2806
01:38:53,703 --> 01:38:55,172
Gosh, even the legs?

2807
01:38:55,173 --> 01:38:57,842
(Placing last will make them feel like they are in prison.)

2808
01:38:57,843 --> 01:38:59,042
This game is called...

2809
01:38:59,043 --> 01:39:00,843
One Voice 369.

2810
01:39:01,013 --> 01:39:03,383
- What?
- The 369 game?

2811
01:39:03,513 --> 01:39:05,453
(One Voice 369)

2812
01:39:05,613 --> 01:39:08,823
You must call out your number and your teammate's number.

2813
01:39:09,953 --> 01:39:12,862
You must clap together as well.

2814
01:39:12,863 --> 01:39:14,122
(They must clap together at 3, 6, and 9!)

2815
01:39:14,123 --> 01:39:16,562
We have to do it together?

2816
01:39:16,563 --> 01:39:17,633
Mine and my partner's.

2817
01:39:18,263 --> 01:39:19,962
- It's done together.
- What was that?

2818
01:39:19,963 --> 01:39:22,533
If you are a six, I have to do it as well.

2819
01:39:22,903 --> 01:39:24,732
If I get a nine, you have to do it as well.

2820
01:39:24,733 --> 01:39:25,733
I have to clap as well?

2821
01:39:25,734 --> 01:39:27,043
I got it down right away.

2822
01:39:27,643 --> 01:39:29,342
(He feels reliable.)

2823
01:39:29,343 --> 01:39:30,742
Call it out together.

2824
01:39:30,743 --> 01:39:33,142
- The 369 game.
- The 369 game.

2825
01:39:33,143 --> 01:39:34,182
- One, two.
- One, two.

2826
01:39:34,183 --> 01:39:35,243
What is that?

2827
01:39:35,443 --> 01:39:36,982
- What is that?
- Four.

2828
01:39:36,983 --> 01:39:38,282
- One, two.
- One, two.

2829
01:39:38,283 --> 01:39:40,382
(What is that?)

2830
01:39:40,383 --> 01:39:42,082
(His turn comes fast.)

2831
01:39:42,083 --> 01:39:43,193
This is how it's done?

2832
01:39:43,553 --> 01:39:45,093
(Yes.)

2833
01:39:45,323 --> 01:39:46,523
What is that?

2834
01:39:47,263 --> 01:39:48,722
You have to call out the numbers together as well.

2835
01:39:48,723 --> 01:39:51,033
I didn't know. How was it done again?

2836
01:39:51,093 --> 01:39:52,632
Let me explain.

2837
01:39:52,633 --> 01:39:54,432
- Try doing it.
- Let's say you are one.

2838
01:39:54,433 --> 01:39:55,962
- We have to call out one together.
- One.

2839
01:39:55,963 --> 01:39:57,932
- We call out two together as well.
- Two.

2840
01:39:57,933 --> 01:39:59,272
- Let's try.
- One, two.

2841
01:39:59,273 --> 01:40:00,942
The 369 game.

2842
01:40:00,943 --> 01:40:02,742
- One, two.
- One, two. Like this?

2843
01:40:02,743 --> 01:40:03,872
- Right.
- Three.

2844
01:40:03,873 --> 01:40:05,042
We have to clap for three.

2845
01:40:05,043 --> 01:40:06,682
- Four is called out together?
- Right.

2846
01:40:06,683 --> 01:40:08,513
Gosh, this is so hard.

2847
01:40:09,243 --> 01:40:10,752
Should we start again from here?

2848
01:40:10,753 --> 01:40:12,782
- From here?
- Starting from Tae Hyun.

2849
01:40:12,783 --> 01:40:14,122
- The 369 game.
- This is so hard.

2850
01:40:14,123 --> 01:40:16,722
- The 369 game.
- The 369 game.

2851
01:40:16,723 --> 01:40:18,123
- One, two.
- One, two.

2852
01:40:18,623 --> 01:40:20,293
- Four.
- Five

2853
01:40:20,923 --> 01:40:23,463
- Seven.
- Incorrect.

2854
01:40:23,693 --> 01:40:24,892
Wasn't it their turn next?

2855
01:40:24,893 --> 01:40:26,233
No way!

2856
01:40:26,363 --> 01:40:27,462
It's our turn right away?

2857
01:40:27,463 --> 01:40:28,702
- Come on.
- I thought it was back and forth...

2858
01:40:28,703 --> 01:40:29,802
like that.

2859
01:40:29,803 --> 01:40:31,773
(I didn't know the direction.)

2860
01:40:31,873 --> 01:40:34,403
Call out all of the issues you might have in advance.

2861
01:40:34,503 --> 01:40:36,342
Will you have any more issues? No?

2862
01:40:36,343 --> 01:40:37,542
- I'm fine now.
- Are you ready now?

2863
01:40:37,543 --> 01:40:39,242
- It goes around like that, right?
- Yes.

2864
01:40:39,243 --> 01:40:40,812
"I didn't know."

2865
01:40:40,813 --> 01:40:42,342
"I didn't know that." You can't say this anymore.

2866
01:40:42,343 --> 01:40:43,552
It's your last chance.

2867
01:40:43,553 --> 01:40:45,382
(Let's go for Round 1.)

2868
01:40:45,383 --> 01:40:47,082
- Let's start with Dong Hyun.
- Okay.

2869
01:40:47,083 --> 01:40:48,152
What's the direction then?

2870
01:40:48,153 --> 01:40:49,153
- This way.
- Like this?

2871
01:40:49,154 --> 01:40:50,252
- It goes around like this, right?
- Yes.

2872
01:40:50,253 --> 01:40:52,193
It keeps going around like that.

2873
01:40:52,493 --> 01:40:54,822
- The 369 game.
- The 369 game.

2874
01:40:54,823 --> 01:40:56,133
- One, two.
- One, two.

2875
01:40:56,863 --> 01:40:58,233
- Four.
- Five.

2876
01:41:00,003 --> 01:41:01,362
(It's here!)

2877
01:41:01,363 --> 01:41:02,433
(Clapping alone)

2878
01:41:03,733 --> 01:41:05,609
(He lost his teamwork after finding the right direction.)

2879
01:41:05,633 --> 01:41:08,142
What was the issue this time?

2880
01:41:08,143 --> 01:41:09,379
- Was there another issue?
- Was there another issue?

2881
01:41:09,403 --> 01:41:11,242
Admit it after three mistakes!

2882
01:41:11,243 --> 01:41:13,213
I did it on my own. I'm sorry.

2883
01:41:13,313 --> 01:41:14,313
What was that?

2884
01:41:14,314 --> 01:41:16,252
- I did it on my own.
- Gosh.

2885
01:41:16,253 --> 01:41:17,812
It would've been harder...

2886
01:41:17,813 --> 01:41:19,583
to bring up the hand that's tied.

2887
01:41:19,683 --> 01:41:22,282
- I finally got it now.
- Okay.

2888
01:41:22,283 --> 01:41:23,492
You guys should be eliminated.

2889
01:41:23,493 --> 01:41:24,692
He missed it.

2890
01:41:24,693 --> 01:41:26,792
It was practice until now.

2891
01:41:26,793 --> 01:41:28,353
We should go around at least one round.

2892
01:41:28,493 --> 01:41:30,509
We should go around at least one round. Who will start?

2893
01:41:30,533 --> 01:41:31,762
Should we start with Hyuk?

2894
01:41:31,763 --> 01:41:33,032
- Okay.
- Me?

2895
01:41:33,033 --> 01:41:34,033
- Hyuk.
- We have to do it together.

2896
01:41:34,034 --> 01:41:36,003
We will never go that way. It's always this way.

2897
01:41:36,333 --> 01:41:38,132
- Gosh.
- Start.

2898
01:41:38,133 --> 01:41:40,442
- The 369 game.
- The 369 game.

2899
01:41:40,443 --> 01:41:41,802
- One.
- One.

2900
01:41:41,803 --> 01:41:43,173
- Two.
- Two.

2901
01:41:43,243 --> 01:41:44,873
- One.
- One.

2902
01:41:45,013 --> 01:41:46,812
(Getting mad after making a mistake)

2903
01:41:46,813 --> 01:41:48,112
We said it was starting from Hyuk.

2904
01:41:48,113 --> 01:41:49,382
We said it was starting from Hyuk.

2905
01:41:49,383 --> 01:41:50,682
- Then am I left out?
- Yes.

2906
01:41:50,683 --> 01:41:52,113
You have to wait for your turn.

2907
01:41:52,353 --> 01:41:54,953
- Just one should be called out.
- Just one should be called out.

2908
01:41:56,493 --> 01:41:58,653
We can't allow any more of this.

2909
01:41:59,193 --> 01:42:00,362
What do I do then?

2910
01:42:00,363 --> 01:42:02,269
- Call out one.
- One should be called out together.

2911
01:42:02,293 --> 01:42:03,653
One should be called out together.

2912
01:42:03,693 --> 01:42:05,462
- One, two, three. One.
- One.

2913
01:42:05,463 --> 01:42:06,863
- Then it's our turn.
- Just one?

2914
01:42:07,163 --> 01:42:08,602
Do we just call out one now?

2915
01:42:08,603 --> 01:42:09,832
- No.
- No!

2916
01:42:09,833 --> 01:42:10,833
(It's moved onto the next turn!)

2917
01:42:10,834 --> 01:42:12,372
- What are you saying?
- Listen up.

2918
01:42:12,373 --> 01:42:14,673
It's hard to play with elders!

2919
01:42:15,073 --> 01:42:17,442
When you add up their age, the total is 100.

2920
01:42:17,443 --> 01:42:18,742
I don't understand.

2921
01:42:18,743 --> 01:42:20,082
- The total of their age is 100.
- I don't get it.

2922
01:42:20,083 --> 01:42:22,043
- I'll explain it to you.
- Okay.

2923
01:42:22,083 --> 01:42:23,382
The game started with Hyuk.

2924
01:42:23,383 --> 01:42:24,782
- I was the starter.
- All right.

2925
01:42:24,783 --> 01:42:26,422
So we have to say it once in the beginning, right?

2926
01:42:26,423 --> 01:42:27,952
- Okay.
- You know what?

2927
01:42:27,953 --> 01:42:29,792
- Isn't the game over?
- Let's play.

2928
01:42:29,793 --> 01:42:31,422
- What?
- This was my mistake.

2929
01:42:31,423 --> 01:42:32,752
- Tae Hyun, - Three and four.

2930
01:42:32,753 --> 01:42:33,762
This is your last time.

2931
01:42:33,763 --> 01:42:35,522
- This is your last time.
- Okay.

2932
01:42:35,523 --> 01:42:36,962
I'll start this time.

2933
01:42:36,963 --> 01:42:37,963
- Okay.
- I will start.

2934
01:42:37,964 --> 01:42:39,233
I will decide the direction.

2935
01:42:39,463 --> 01:42:42,232
(This is really the last Round 1.)

2936
01:42:42,233 --> 01:42:43,572
(This way)

2937
01:42:43,573 --> 01:42:44,573
- Two.
- Two.

2938
01:42:45,503 --> 01:42:46,873
- Four, five.
- Four, five.

2939
01:42:47,143 --> 01:42:48,443
- Four, five.
- Four, five.

2940
01:42:48,943 --> 01:42:51,143
(The elders finally understood the rules.)

2941
01:42:51,913 --> 01:42:53,543
- Seven, eight.
- Seven, eight.

2942
01:42:54,143 --> 01:42:55,443
- Ten, eleven.
- Ten, eleven.

2943
01:42:55,483 --> 01:43:00,123
(Now that the elders understood the rules, they can advance.)

2944
01:43:00,453 --> 01:43:01,623
- Eighteen.
- Eighteen.

2945
01:43:01,983 --> 01:43:03,569
- Twenty, twenty-one.
- Twenty, twenty-one.

2946
01:43:03,593 --> 01:43:04,693
- Twenty-two.
- Twenty-two.

2947
01:43:05,393 --> 01:43:06,762
(They finally understood the rules.)

2948
01:43:06,763 --> 01:43:07,792
We got it.

2949
01:43:07,793 --> 01:43:10,163
(As they progress rapidly, )

2950
01:43:12,063 --> 01:43:16,203
(they arrive at the 30s with lots of clapping.)

2951
01:43:16,403 --> 01:43:17,432
(Full of tension)

2952
01:43:17,433 --> 01:43:18,533
What's next?

2953
01:43:19,273 --> 01:43:21,143
What's next?

2954
01:43:21,773 --> 01:43:23,013
What is it? Do you know?

2955
01:43:23,513 --> 01:43:25,513
It's 40.

2956
01:43:25,573 --> 01:43:26,612
(After watching them)

2957
01:43:26,613 --> 01:43:27,682
What is it? Do you know?

2958
01:43:27,683 --> 01:43:30,082
(He claps quickly.)

2959
01:43:30,083 --> 01:43:31,252
Am I right?

2960
01:43:31,253 --> 01:43:32,583
- It's 40.
- It's 40.

2961
01:43:32,653 --> 01:43:34,052
- You had to say 40.
- Really?

2962
01:43:34,053 --> 01:43:35,223
Did we have to clap?

2963
01:43:35,253 --> 01:43:37,392
- It was over for me already.
- Goodness,

2964
01:43:37,393 --> 01:43:39,153
- when did we get to the 40s?
- It was so...

2965
01:43:39,723 --> 01:43:40,893
I have no idea.

2966
01:43:41,123 --> 01:43:42,262
I can't figure it out.

2967
01:43:42,263 --> 01:43:43,432
The game is over anyway.

2968
01:43:43,433 --> 01:43:45,563
So did Tae Hyun place last?

2969
01:43:45,633 --> 01:43:46,662
- Yes.
- Already?

2970
01:43:46,663 --> 01:43:48,002
- Is it the only game we're playing?
- Yes.

2971
01:43:48,003 --> 01:43:49,872
- Hey.
- Of course.

2972
01:43:49,873 --> 01:43:51,273
Is this all?

2973
01:43:51,333 --> 01:43:52,372
Darn it.

2974
01:43:52,373 --> 01:43:53,443
(I'm doomed.)

2975
01:43:53,503 --> 01:43:55,343
(That's hilarious.)

2976
01:43:55,703 --> 01:43:57,942
- So now...
- It's over for the two of you.

2977
01:43:57,943 --> 01:43:59,642
- Let's play.
- Shall we give a penalty?

2978
01:43:59,643 --> 01:44:01,112
- Like what?
- You know why?

2979
01:44:01,113 --> 01:44:02,713
I'm afraid that the game will never end.

2980
01:44:02,783 --> 01:44:04,012
Let's try up to 100. We won't make it.

2981
01:44:04,013 --> 01:44:05,712
You can't do it all the way to 100.

2982
01:44:05,713 --> 01:44:08,382
If you make it, I'll give you 1,000 dollars.

2983
01:44:08,383 --> 01:44:09,383
(Seriously?)

2984
01:44:09,384 --> 01:44:10,822
- Really?
- If you make it up to 100.

2985
01:44:10,823 --> 01:44:11,952
- In that case...
- Shall we try it?

2986
01:44:11,953 --> 01:44:13,492
- Let's give it a try.
- Let's do it.

2987
01:44:13,493 --> 01:44:15,592
Let's do it. One, two, three.

2988
01:44:15,593 --> 01:44:16,632
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

2989
01:44:16,633 --> 01:44:17,633
All right.

2990
01:44:17,634 --> 01:44:18,662
(Let's go for 1,000 dollars.)

2991
01:44:18,663 --> 01:44:20,362
However, you can't play slowly.

2992
01:44:20,363 --> 01:44:21,732
Suddenly, you're getting nervous.

2993
01:44:21,733 --> 01:44:23,003
No, I'm not.

2994
01:44:23,133 --> 01:44:25,132
- We will play it now.
- Okay.

2995
01:44:25,133 --> 01:44:26,572
- Let's give it a try.
- Sure.

2996
01:44:26,573 --> 01:44:27,779
We'll play and decide the winner.

2997
01:44:27,803 --> 01:44:29,272
- We will play in this order.
- Gosh.

2998
01:44:29,273 --> 01:44:31,112
- They will never make it.
- To determine 1st and 2nd place.

2999
01:44:31,113 --> 01:44:32,349
(A challenge to win 1,000 dollars)

3000
01:44:32,373 --> 01:44:33,683
- One, two.
- One, two.

3001
01:44:34,443 --> 01:44:35,783
- Four, five.
- Four, five.

3002
01:44:36,413 --> 01:44:37,783
- Seven, eight.
- Seven, eight.

3003
01:44:38,353 --> 01:44:40,623
(It's easy so far.)

3004
01:44:41,053 --> 01:44:42,053
- Fourteen.
- Fourteen.

3005
01:44:42,053 --> 01:44:43,053
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen.

3006
01:44:43,493 --> 01:44:46,463
(They advance with ease without the elders.)

3007
01:44:46,893 --> 01:44:49,253
- Twenty-seven, twenty-eight.
- Twenty-seven, twenty-eight.

3008
01:44:50,263 --> 01:44:53,133
(They enter the critical 30s section.)

3009
01:44:56,033 --> 01:44:58,303
It's hard to tell after the 30s.

3010
01:45:01,343 --> 01:45:03,712
Sang Uk isn't focused anymore.

3011
01:45:03,713 --> 01:45:04,743
- Forty.
- Forty.

3012
01:45:04,943 --> 01:45:06,812
- You had to clap twice at 39.
- See that?

3013
01:45:06,813 --> 01:45:08,242
- You're right.
- That's right.

3014
01:45:08,243 --> 01:45:10,112
- Did we not clap twice?
- We only clapped once.

3015
01:45:10,113 --> 01:45:13,123
See that? They can't do it either.

3016
01:45:13,153 --> 01:45:16,152
Try it all you want. You won't ever get to 100.

3017
01:45:16,153 --> 01:45:18,053
- Goodness.
- It's not easy.

3018
01:45:18,593 --> 01:45:19,692
It's really difficult.

3019
01:45:19,693 --> 01:45:20,992
Dong Hyun...

3020
01:45:20,993 --> 01:45:22,562
and Sang Uk placed first.

3021
01:45:22,563 --> 01:45:24,533
- Okay.
- Yes.

3022
01:45:24,633 --> 01:45:26,162
We will switch your cord right away.

3023
01:45:26,163 --> 01:45:27,333
Thank you.

3024
01:45:27,563 --> 01:45:29,933
To the 2 of you who placed 1st,

3025
01:45:30,003 --> 01:45:31,209
I'll give you the armband as well.

3026
01:45:31,233 --> 01:45:33,103
Does the armband mean anything?

3027
01:45:33,343 --> 01:45:35,373
I told you to pick me.

3028
01:45:36,743 --> 01:45:38,513
(And...)

3029
01:45:38,613 --> 01:45:40,583
This is really tight.

3030
01:45:40,883 --> 01:45:43,883
It makes me feel like I committed a serious crime.

3031
01:45:44,253 --> 01:45:46,353
It looks like I committed a huge crime.

3032
01:45:47,053 --> 01:45:48,982
- Being tied like this...
- Can two of you walk for a minute?

3033
01:45:48,983 --> 01:45:50,292
- How does it feel?
- It feels...

3034
01:45:50,293 --> 01:45:51,423
Oh, my.

3035
01:45:51,453 --> 01:45:53,123
It's clearly different.

3036
01:45:53,223 --> 01:45:55,592
We're similar in size, so it works.

3037
01:45:55,593 --> 01:45:56,593
Let's go this way.

3038
01:45:56,593 --> 01:45:57,593
Let's see.

3039
01:45:58,063 --> 01:45:59,902
- Gosh, this is...
- It's really comfortable.

3040
01:45:59,903 --> 01:46:02,063
I can go this far on my own.

3041
01:46:03,603 --> 01:46:04,873
It's not so bad for us either.

3042
01:46:05,273 --> 01:46:06,273
The two of you...

3043
01:46:06,274 --> 01:46:07,402
look like an old couple.

3044
01:46:07,403 --> 01:46:08,542
(Laughing)

3045
01:46:08,543 --> 01:46:10,242
You look like a couple...

3046
01:46:10,243 --> 01:46:12,573
out for an evening hike as the sun sets.

3047
01:46:13,543 --> 01:46:15,843
We used to be young stars back in the day.

3048
01:46:17,183 --> 01:46:19,052
At one point,

3049
01:46:19,053 --> 01:46:21,152
we played main roles in a miniseries...

3050
01:46:21,153 --> 01:46:23,322
that reached 40 percent in viewership.

3051
01:46:23,323 --> 01:46:24,392
What was the drama called?

3052
01:46:24,393 --> 01:46:25,492
- "Into the Sunlight." - "Into the Sunlight."

3053
01:46:25,493 --> 01:46:26,522
- Were you both in it?
- Yes.

3054
01:46:26,523 --> 01:46:27,662
It was my first lead role.

3055
01:46:27,663 --> 01:46:28,862
It was our first time working together.

3056
01:46:28,863 --> 01:46:29,963
Both of you?

3057
01:46:30,763 --> 01:46:34,462
(The iconic teen stars in the 90s, Tae Hyun and Hyuk)

3058
01:46:34,463 --> 01:46:36,933
(We were so young back then.)

3059
01:46:37,173 --> 01:46:40,642
- How did we become criminals?
- Seriously.

3060
01:46:40,643 --> 01:46:44,212
(Now they're criminals with shackles.)

3061
01:46:44,213 --> 01:46:45,842
Are we going to play a game or not?

3062
01:46:45,843 --> 01:46:47,012
What are we doing next?

3063
01:46:47,013 --> 01:46:48,783
What can we do with our feet tied?

3064
01:46:49,283 --> 01:46:50,852
Since our feet are tied,

3065
01:46:50,853 --> 01:46:51,853
we can't do anything.

3066
01:46:52,319 --> 01:46:55,689
(Shortage in Privacy continues.)

3067
01:46:55,949 --> 01:46:58,219
(The members gradually become one.)

3068
01:46:58,359 --> 01:47:02,189
(Enjoying a nice dinner without individualism?)

3069
01:47:02,629 --> 01:47:04,058
(Abruptly)

3070
01:47:04,059 --> 01:47:06,059
(Beep, you veered off course.)

3071
01:47:06,229 --> 01:47:07,589
It won't work if it gets too high.

3072
01:47:08,469 --> 01:47:10,669
(Resenting)

3073
01:47:10,839 --> 01:47:12,939
(Criticizing each other)

3074
01:47:13,039 --> 01:47:14,738
- This isn't about taking revenge.
- Okay.

3075
01:47:14,739 --> 01:47:16,679
- We have to cooperate.
- Okay.

3076
01:47:17,709 --> 01:47:19,978
(Individualism is still prevalent.)

3077
01:47:19,979 --> 01:47:21,939
(The ultimate remedy prescribed to Handsome Guys)

3078
01:47:22,109 --> 01:47:24,879
(The 5 of them unite.)

3079
01:47:25,219 --> 01:47:27,148
(They must work together to win their privacy back.)

3080
01:47:27,149 --> 01:47:28,349
(Smiling)

3081
01:47:28,719 --> 01:47:30,519
- Okay.
- Okay.

3082
01:47:31,359 --> 01:47:34,189
(What do Handsome Guys need to escape the shortage?)

3083
01:47:34,259 --> 01:47:35,758
(Escape the Shortage Checklist)

3084
01:47:35,759 --> 01:47:37,259
(1. Getting in sync)

3085
01:47:39,259 --> 01:47:41,329
(We're still trying to get in sync.)

3086
01:47:41,369 --> 01:47:44,869
(2. Cooperating)

3087
01:47:44,899 --> 01:47:46,809
He's not working even though he has free hands.

3088
01:47:47,069 --> 01:47:48,608
(Cooperating is still difficult.)

3089
01:47:48,609 --> 01:47:50,938
(3. Reading each other's mind)

3090
01:47:50,939 --> 01:47:53,948
(Working hard)

3091
01:47:53,949 --> 01:47:54,949
Pass.

3092
01:47:54,950 --> 01:47:56,819
(We can't read each other's mind either.)

3093
01:47:57,279 --> 01:48:00,518
(Will Handsome Guys be able to get...)

3094
01:48:00,519 --> 01:48:03,985
(their privacy back and go home?)
