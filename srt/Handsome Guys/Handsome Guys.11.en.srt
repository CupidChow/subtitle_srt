1
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:33,603
(Gapyeong, Gyeonggi Province at 7:30am)

2
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,772
Gosh, hello.

3
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:38,849
(Deep in the mountains in Gyeonggi Province with a fierce cold)

4
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:39,882
Goodness.

5
00:00:39,883 --> 00:00:41,111
- It would look beautiful on screen.
- Hello.

6
00:00:41,112 --> 00:00:42,141
- Hello.
- What's this?

7
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:43,782
- It'd look beautiful.
- Hello.

8
00:00:43,783 --> 00:00:44,783
Hello.

9
00:00:44,784 --> 00:00:46,722
- The weather is nice today.
- Yes.

10
00:00:46,723 --> 00:00:49,623
Sang Uk is going abroad tomorrow...

11
00:00:50,193 --> 00:00:51,492
for his main job.

12
00:00:51,493 --> 00:00:52,852
- Fortunately, - I have a match tomorrow.

13
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:54,262
He has enough time for the penalty.

14
00:00:54,263 --> 00:00:56,122
- Really?
- What time is your flight?

15
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:57,332
- What time is your flight?
- Tomorrow later in the day.

16
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,031
It's tomorrow night.

17
00:00:59,032 --> 00:01:00,101
- Tomorrow night?
- Yes.

18
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,403
Then it won't be a problem.

19
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:03,332
You're being harsh.

20
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,573
It won't be a problem at all.

21
00:01:05,102 --> 00:01:06,741
(Few days later, Sang Uk made it...)

22
00:01:06,742 --> 00:01:08,503
(to the top in the world again.)

23
00:01:08,672 --> 00:01:09,911
(The final round of men sabre, individual game...)

24
00:01:09,912 --> 00:01:11,473
(at Fencing World Cup in Bulgaria)

25
00:01:11,912 --> 00:01:17,952
(Like the fencing emperor, he dominated the 1st place.)

26
00:01:18,513 --> 00:01:21,952
(Anyway, everyone is worried about Sang Uk.)

27
00:01:24,492 --> 00:01:25,792
- It's very...
- What's that?

28
00:01:25,793 --> 00:01:27,022
The sun looks so beautiful.

29
00:01:28,023 --> 00:01:30,191
Doesn't it look like our show that's about to rise?

30
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:31,192
Right.

31
00:01:31,493 --> 00:01:34,001
During the show last week, we were told that...

32
00:01:34,002 --> 00:01:35,662
we need to endure it during the first half of the year.

33
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:37,672
- We must endure it.
- It has a lot of potential.

34
00:01:38,032 --> 00:01:39,772
It was a good omen.

35
00:01:39,773 --> 00:01:40,941
Gosh, it rose all of a sudden.

36
00:01:40,942 --> 00:01:43,811
But why do I feel like we're still walking on thin ice?

37
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:44,842
I agree.

38
00:01:45,112 --> 00:01:47,081
Our viewers need to hang in there a little more.

39
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:48,712
But I don't feel positive.

40
00:01:48,713 --> 00:01:50,751
We keep seeing good signs...

41
00:01:50,752 --> 00:01:52,552
about our future.

42
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:54,823
We keep getting messages.

43
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,691
The sun was rising, but it's behind the clouds.

44
00:01:56,692 --> 00:01:57,853
Don't say that.

45
00:01:58,222 --> 00:01:59,691
- Dong Hyun.
- Don't say things like that.

46
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:01,493
Am I wrong? It was rising.

47
00:02:02,062 --> 00:02:03,963
Cut right before he says that.

48
00:02:04,532 --> 00:02:05,793
It's rising well...

49
00:02:05,963 --> 00:02:07,808
even though it's covered slightly by the clouds.

50
00:02:07,832 --> 00:02:09,561
- Right.
- It's ironic.

51
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:10,803
You're right.

52
00:02:10,972 --> 00:02:13,543
I like watching our show because I get to learn.

53
00:02:13,603 --> 00:02:15,001
- Right.
- It's very nice.

54
00:02:15,002 --> 00:02:16,043
By the way...

55
00:02:16,743 --> 00:02:17,743
(Surprised)

56
00:02:18,213 --> 00:02:19,542
Is that our guest today?

57
00:02:19,543 --> 00:02:21,941
- Hello.
- Hello.

58
00:02:21,942 --> 00:02:22,982
Hello.

59
00:02:23,082 --> 00:02:25,481
Kyung Ho is here.

60
00:02:25,482 --> 00:02:26,582
(They know each other.)

61
00:02:26,752 --> 00:02:27,781
Hello.

62
00:02:27,782 --> 00:02:29,751
- You have a strong presence.
- His presence?

63
00:02:29,752 --> 00:02:31,893
His presence.

64
00:02:31,953 --> 00:02:34,822
Kyung Ho's presence...

65
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:37,462
(He runs up to him like a brown bear.)

66
00:02:37,463 --> 00:02:39,561
Actually...

67
00:02:39,562 --> 00:02:41,161
- His presence is...
- He has a good body.

68
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:43,162
His jacket is...

69
00:02:43,972 --> 00:02:45,631
- almost like...
- This is a nice jacket.

70
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,471
This is what makes him look good.

71
00:02:47,472 --> 00:02:48,873
I heard that this is expensive.

72
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:50,272
Is your jacket expensive?

73
00:02:50,273 --> 00:02:52,311
- I heard it was a luxury brand.
- It's not that expensive.

74
00:02:52,312 --> 00:02:54,482
- Is it a famous brand?
- Tae Hyun, it isn't that expensive.

75
00:02:54,483 --> 00:02:57,483
It's made by a designer brand.

76
00:02:57,613 --> 00:03:00,251
We're making a lot of fun of him as soon as he arrived.

77
00:03:00,252 --> 00:03:02,221
Could you introduce yourself?

78
00:03:02,222 --> 00:03:04,053
Introduce yourself.

79
00:03:04,222 --> 00:03:05,623
Hello, nice to meet you.

80
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,161
I'm Actor Yoon Kyung Ho.

81
00:03:07,162 --> 00:03:11,191
(I'm Actor Yoon Kyung Ho.)

82
00:03:11,192 --> 00:03:13,902
How did you end up being on our show?

83
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:15,661
- We met...
- "Unexpected Business."

84
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:17,403
on "Unexpected Business."

85
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:20,941
Coincidentally, with Actor Ju Ji Hoon,

86
00:03:20,942 --> 00:03:24,213
I'm on a streaming TV show called...

87
00:03:24,743 --> 00:03:26,441
"The Trauma Code: Heroes On Call."

88
00:03:26,442 --> 00:03:29,342
You're here at perfect timing.

89
00:03:31,083 --> 00:03:32,751
(He appears...)

90
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:35,352
(as a proctologist named Han Yu Rim.)

91
00:03:35,623 --> 00:03:38,022
(As a funny character, )

92
00:03:38,023 --> 00:03:41,493
(he performs while showing off his insane presence.)

93
00:03:41,762 --> 00:03:44,892
(I'm Yoon Kyung Ho, you jerks!)

94
00:03:44,893 --> 00:03:47,462
Have you seen our show?

95
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:49,502
- Yes, I'm a big fan.
- What do you think?

96
00:03:49,703 --> 00:03:51,601
After watching it, he scolded me...

97
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:53,842
for not being able to answer such questions.

98
00:03:54,143 --> 00:03:55,172
Goodness.

99
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:56,571
- I could answer some of them.
- See that?

100
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:57,772
(Full of confidence)

101
00:03:57,773 --> 00:03:59,471
To be honest, Tae Hyun does an excellent job.

102
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:00,541
Right.

103
00:04:00,542 --> 00:04:01,582
- He's really good.
- Goodness.

104
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,082
- Actually...
- Tae Hyun is smart.

105
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,682
Here's my goal of being on the show.

106
00:04:05,683 --> 00:04:07,452
I'd like Tae Hyun to get the penalty.

107
00:04:07,453 --> 00:04:08,523
Okay.

108
00:04:08,722 --> 00:04:10,552
- I want him to get the penalty.
- That sounds good.

109
00:04:10,553 --> 00:04:13,463
Why don't you select your team?

110
00:04:13,893 --> 00:04:15,463
Here's my thought.

111
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:17,062
Yi Kyung.

112
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:18,433
Kyung from Yi Kyung.

113
00:04:18,792 --> 00:04:19,862
Seung Ho.

114
00:04:19,863 --> 00:04:22,102
Yi Kyung and Seung Ho.

115
00:04:22,463 --> 00:04:24,333
- Kyung and Ho.
- Since he's Kyung Ho?

116
00:04:24,602 --> 00:04:25,702
And so...

117
00:04:25,703 --> 00:04:27,372
- Like this?
- Us three?

118
00:04:27,373 --> 00:04:29,272
I'd be more than happy.

119
00:04:29,273 --> 00:04:31,212
- What do you think?
- I like this team.

120
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:32,612
- You feel uncomfortable?
- I like it.

121
00:04:32,613 --> 00:04:33,613
Do you feel uncomfortable?

122
00:04:33,614 --> 00:04:35,511
Have we been a team before?

123
00:04:35,512 --> 00:04:37,213
- Not the three of us.
- We never have.

124
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:38,552
We've never been a team before?

125
00:04:38,553 --> 00:04:39,833
- It's your first time.
- Right.

126
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:41,122
(Fascinated)

127
00:04:41,123 --> 00:04:42,252
- It's okay.
- I mean,

128
00:04:42,522 --> 00:04:44,222
I'm happy with this team,

129
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:46,152
but how many times have I worked with Dong Hyun?

130
00:04:46,423 --> 00:04:48,262
It always feels new to me. I don't mind.

131
00:04:48,593 --> 00:04:50,992
Doesn't it feel new?

132
00:04:50,993 --> 00:04:52,061
It's one-sided love.

133
00:04:52,062 --> 00:04:54,022
It's our first time working together in Gapyeong.

134
00:04:54,702 --> 00:04:56,802
It's my first time with Tae Hyun in Gapyeong.

135
00:04:56,803 --> 00:04:57,972
- Okay.
- With a new attitude.

136
00:04:57,973 --> 00:04:58,973
Okay.

137
00:04:58,974 --> 00:05:00,972
I'm curious to find out...

138
00:05:00,973 --> 00:05:03,473
if there are new chance cards today.

139
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:05,311
- Go ahead, Dong Hyun.
- Go first.

140
00:05:05,312 --> 00:05:06,343
Me? Okay.

141
00:05:07,142 --> 00:05:09,081
- Isn't it us next?
- Seung Ho can go.

142
00:05:09,082 --> 00:05:10,251
(What will be the variables today?)

143
00:05:10,252 --> 00:05:11,283
The third one?

144
00:05:11,812 --> 00:05:12,982
- Go, Seung Ho.
- The third one seems...

145
00:05:12,983 --> 00:05:14,082
strange.

146
00:05:15,223 --> 00:05:17,223
(Ambiguous)

147
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:19,093
Let's go up together.

148
00:05:19,293 --> 00:05:20,293
(Laughing)

149
00:05:20,294 --> 00:05:21,461
I have a good one.

150
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:23,492
- Can I see it?
- It must be a bad one.

151
00:05:23,493 --> 00:05:25,793
(What's wrong, Kyung Ho?)

152
00:05:26,363 --> 00:05:27,631
(Shocked)

153
00:05:27,632 --> 00:05:30,131
- It must be bad.
- Our guest is...

154
00:05:30,132 --> 00:05:31,472
(Our guest is...)

155
00:05:31,473 --> 00:05:32,933
unlucky from the start.

156
00:05:34,772 --> 00:05:36,402
We have a new chance card.

157
00:05:36,772 --> 00:05:38,413
Don't we have any reattempt cards?

158
00:05:38,843 --> 00:05:39,913
Do you have one?

159
00:05:40,012 --> 00:05:41,343
Okay, we got it.

160
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:42,642
- Okay.
- It's good.

161
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:43,682
It's not bad.

162
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:44,683
(A nice card)

163
00:05:44,684 --> 00:05:45,982
It seems like they have one reattempt card...

164
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:47,252
and a 30-minute nap card.

165
00:05:47,553 --> 00:05:48,782
Do you have wishing happy birthday card?

166
00:05:48,783 --> 00:05:50,903
- You're right. Tell us about yours.
- It's our turn.

167
00:05:51,093 --> 00:05:52,422
We have one reattempt card.

168
00:05:52,423 --> 00:05:54,292
- They have one reattempt card.
- What about...

169
00:05:54,293 --> 00:05:55,521
I picked it.

170
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:56,831
(Reattempt card, identification card)

171
00:05:56,832 --> 00:05:57,862
It's a new card,

172
00:05:57,863 --> 00:06:00,402
and it can be powerful.

173
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:02,362
Show us what it is. I want to know.

174
00:06:02,363 --> 00:06:03,771
Kyung Ho, I want to know about yours.

175
00:06:03,772 --> 00:06:05,802
- What is it?
- Claw machine.

176
00:06:05,803 --> 00:06:07,302
A claw machine card?

177
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:08,901
- Thirty minutes.
- That's enough.

178
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,211
We shouldn't show them everything.

179
00:06:10,212 --> 00:06:11,542
You have to win a stuffed toy within 30 minutes.

180
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:12,823
- Right.
- That won't take long.

181
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:15,043
What's the theme for our trip in Gyeonggi Province?

182
00:06:15,913 --> 00:06:17,582
Today's Handsome Heritage is...

183
00:06:18,212 --> 00:06:20,222
content creators in Gyeonggi Province.

184
00:06:20,223 --> 00:06:22,422
(Today's theme: Content creators in Gyeonggi Province)

185
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:24,622
(For example)

186
00:06:24,623 --> 00:06:26,891
(Eating shows)

187
00:06:26,892 --> 00:06:30,232
(Working out)

188
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:32,331
(Traveling)

189
00:06:32,332 --> 00:06:35,932
(Media contents loved by the public)

190
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:39,102
You'll be meeting famous content creators today.

191
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,902
(Meet various content creators)

192
00:06:41,103 --> 00:06:45,112
(Filming in process)

193
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:48,112
You will also shoot a short video together.

194
00:06:48,113 --> 00:06:50,043
(Make a short video and make it public!)

195
00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:54,122
(Upload on the content creator's channel)

196
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:55,183
What's this?

197
00:06:55,322 --> 00:06:56,322
What are the themes?

198
00:06:56,323 --> 00:06:59,522
"Cover, beauty, workout, lifestyle, and eating shows?"

199
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:01,761
- What's cover?
- Isn't it making cover songs?

200
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:05,033
- People who sing cover songs.
- There are many.

201
00:07:05,593 --> 00:07:07,163
"Casting on the street?"

202
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:10,163
In Yongin? That means...

203
00:07:10,402 --> 00:07:12,672
I know everyone at Everland.

204
00:07:12,673 --> 00:07:14,271
- How do you know them?
- What?

205
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:16,071
How do you know them?

206
00:07:16,072 --> 00:07:17,972
I think I know them like this.

207
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:19,242
(Something like this?)

208
00:07:19,243 --> 00:07:21,641
You have to hold like this because you're a brick.

209
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:24,053
Did I hold the safety bar like this or that?

210
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:26,451
- It depends on the ride.
- Okay.

211
00:07:26,452 --> 00:07:27,822
Is that what you meant?

212
00:07:27,952 --> 00:07:29,223
You must really know.

213
00:07:29,252 --> 00:07:30,892
There's an activity...

214
00:07:31,123 --> 00:07:33,663
in Gyeonggi Province for the losing team.

215
00:07:34,392 --> 00:07:38,033
As a winter vacation special, it's collecting insects.

216
00:07:38,663 --> 00:07:41,202
(On the mountain path in the winter with a heavy fog)

217
00:07:41,803 --> 00:07:43,902
(Climb up the mountain...)

218
00:07:44,002 --> 00:07:48,243
(and collect insects.)

219
00:07:51,072 --> 00:07:53,043
- What's number six?
- What's this?

220
00:07:53,142 --> 00:07:55,081
- What's number six?
- What's this?

221
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:56,082
(A square without a theme?)

222
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,152
"Handsome Guys?"

223
00:07:58,012 --> 00:08:00,751
You will take your first quiz here.

224
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:01,952
The winning team will...

225
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:04,092
obtain the Handsome Guys square.

226
00:08:04,093 --> 00:08:06,613
(The team to answer the quiz obtains the Handsome Guys square.)

227
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:07,762
That's amazing.

228
00:08:08,293 --> 00:08:10,413
- We never had this before.
- This is very important.

229
00:08:10,762 --> 00:08:12,992
(Handsome Guys)

230
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:15,632
(Time for Quiz)

231
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:20,033
A video was uploaded for the first time on YouTube...

232
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:23,272
on April 24, 2005.

233
00:08:23,473 --> 00:08:26,211
It was filmed by YouTube Founder, Jawed Karim.

234
00:08:26,212 --> 00:08:29,342
It was about elephants at the zoo.

235
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:30,381
I have no idea about this.

236
00:08:30,382 --> 00:08:31,452
Then...

237
00:08:31,853 --> 00:08:34,081
three months later,

238
00:08:34,082 --> 00:08:37,293
a video was uploaded on YouTube for the first time in Korea.

239
00:08:38,053 --> 00:08:39,751
What was it about?

240
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,622
- What was it about?
- What?

241
00:08:41,623 --> 00:08:43,061
- With whom...
- Was it even possible?

242
00:08:43,062 --> 00:08:44,292
- Hold on.
- Who uploaded it?

243
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:45,831
You know? Yi Kyung knows.

244
00:08:45,832 --> 00:08:47,902
- I saw it somewhere.
- Who uploaded it?

245
00:08:48,002 --> 00:08:50,373
I knew about the elephant video.

246
00:08:50,433 --> 00:08:51,702
- You knew about it?
- I knew.

247
00:08:51,803 --> 00:08:53,473
- Why don't we discuss?
- This...

248
00:08:53,603 --> 00:08:54,771
(Anxious)

249
00:08:54,772 --> 00:08:56,648
You don't want to discuss? They have their backs on us. Okay.

250
00:08:56,672 --> 00:08:58,511
(You don't want to discuss? They have their backs on us.)

251
00:08:58,512 --> 00:08:59,648
- They have their backs on us.
- Okay.

252
00:08:59,672 --> 00:09:00,682
Okay, I got it.

253
00:09:01,213 --> 00:09:02,582
This is...

254
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,641
I think...

255
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:05,912
- we'll have to guess.
- I have no idea about YouTube.

256
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:08,953
Generally in Korea...

257
00:09:09,422 --> 00:09:10,622
I'm asking what it was about.

258
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:13,761
There must be the first YouTube video in Korea.

259
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:16,192
Was it uploaded on his personal channel?

260
00:09:16,193 --> 00:09:17,892
Is he still running his channel?

261
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:20,502
- He's doing something?
- He's doing something.

262
00:09:20,563 --> 00:09:21,603
Who?

263
00:09:21,802 --> 00:09:23,631
- You mean, that person?
- Someone.

264
00:09:23,632 --> 00:09:25,573
(They still have no idea.)

265
00:09:26,203 --> 00:09:28,842
Wait, how about...

266
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:30,272
Let's go with it.

267
00:09:30,343 --> 00:09:31,642
This is famous, after all.

268
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,112
We'll take a look at your answers.

269
00:09:34,113 --> 00:09:35,943
Show your answer in the count of three.

270
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:37,613
One, two, three.

271
00:09:38,213 --> 00:09:40,422
(Team Guys picked games.)

272
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:42,822
Your answer is games, and ours is workout.

273
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:44,128
(Could one of them be the answer?)

274
00:09:44,152 --> 00:09:45,192
The answer is...

275
00:09:45,193 --> 00:09:47,261
(Could one of them be the answer?)

276
00:09:47,262 --> 00:09:48,661
(Team Guys: Games...)

277
00:09:48,662 --> 00:09:50,123
(versus Team Handsome: Workout)

278
00:09:51,432 --> 00:09:52,563
None of them.

279
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:54,902
I know!

280
00:09:55,302 --> 00:09:57,131
- But...
- Shouldn't we write it down?

281
00:09:57,132 --> 00:09:58,572
- Do you want to try again?
- Yes.

282
00:09:58,573 --> 00:09:59,631
Team Guys.

283
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:00,771
Okay.

284
00:10:00,772 --> 00:10:02,102
- Parenting.
- Parenting?

285
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:03,712
No, not parenting. It was about kids.

286
00:10:03,713 --> 00:10:05,742
- Kids?
- Kids.

287
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:07,041
- What?
- Kids.

288
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:09,002
What's the difference between parenting and kids?

289
00:10:09,113 --> 00:10:11,082
- Combine the two. Parenting kids.
- Parenting?

290
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,152
Kids and parenting?

291
00:10:13,853 --> 00:10:15,722
- That's incorrect.
- Goodness.

292
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:17,551
- That's incorrect.
- Goodness.

293
00:10:17,552 --> 00:10:19,352
That's good.

294
00:10:19,353 --> 00:10:20,391
That startled me.

295
00:10:20,392 --> 00:10:22,421
(Team Handsome gets a chance to answer.)

296
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:24,031
Good, it's our turn now.

297
00:10:24,032 --> 00:10:25,261
Which number is this?

298
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:27,131
(Their eyes and ears work fast.)

299
00:10:27,132 --> 00:10:29,131
- Number 20?
- We'll go.

300
00:10:29,132 --> 00:10:31,032
- All right.
- This is a clear answer.

301
00:10:31,103 --> 00:10:32,103
Okay.

302
00:10:32,203 --> 00:10:33,373
Artistic activity.

303
00:10:34,203 --> 00:10:36,801
What do you mean by artistic activity?

304
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:37,812
Drawing?

305
00:10:37,813 --> 00:10:40,742
- It's too vast.
- It can be dancing or singing.

306
00:10:40,743 --> 00:10:42,512
- That's too vast.
- Just pick one.

307
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,782
- Artistic activity.
- Artistic activity?

308
00:10:45,813 --> 00:10:46,983
It has to be correct.

309
00:10:47,123 --> 00:10:48,252
That's incorrect.

310
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:50,352
- Okay, we got two wrong.
- We narrowed it down.

311
00:10:50,353 --> 00:10:51,551
In that case...

312
00:10:51,552 --> 00:10:53,791
- As the first video...
- Food?

313
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:55,422
It must be something about...

314
00:10:55,623 --> 00:10:56,792
What? I know.

315
00:10:56,922 --> 00:10:58,162
What is it?

316
00:10:58,463 --> 00:10:59,632
I trust your feelings.

317
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,502
An activity at home.

318
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:05,353
Food, clothing, and shelter.

319
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,248
- An activity at home.
- That can't be an answer.

320
00:11:07,272 --> 00:11:08,772
That's ridiculous.

321
00:11:08,843 --> 00:11:11,512
- At one's home...
- Or outside the home is right.

322
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:12,912
That's true.

323
00:11:13,313 --> 00:11:15,342
Tae Hyun, what should we say?

324
00:11:15,343 --> 00:11:16,343
(They pull a lot of tricks during the quiz.)

325
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:17,888
- Hurry. We don't have time.
- At one's home...

326
00:11:17,912 --> 00:11:19,012
This makes no sense,

327
00:11:19,382 --> 00:11:20,882
but an activity related to sleeping.

328
00:11:21,552 --> 00:11:23,282
- Sleeping.
- Is the person sleeping?

329
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,251
An activity at home related to sleeping?

330
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,993
He filmed himself sleeping.

331
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:28,992
- That's incorrect.
- Tae Hyun, it was wrong.

332
00:11:28,993 --> 00:11:29,993
(Of course it's incorrect.)

333
00:11:29,994 --> 00:11:32,661
- Then I'll give you a hint.
- Okay.

334
00:11:32,662 --> 00:11:33,768
(Giving a hint to make it fair for both teams)

335
00:11:33,792 --> 00:11:34,932
This video shows...

336
00:11:36,402 --> 00:11:38,531
an activity done with coworkers.

337
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:39,573
- I know.
- Okay.

338
00:11:40,103 --> 00:11:41,103
(Kyung Ho raised his hand first.)

339
00:11:41,104 --> 00:11:42,472
- He was faster.
- A get-together at work.

340
00:11:42,473 --> 00:11:43,993
- A get-together at work?
- He got it.

341
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:46,772
He got it.

342
00:11:47,613 --> 00:11:48,613
That's correct.

343
00:11:48,614 --> 00:11:50,443
(A get-together at work)

344
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:54,782
(Doctor Han made it!)

345
00:11:55,522 --> 00:11:57,123
I told you that I'd win.

346
00:11:57,392 --> 00:11:59,051
I told you that I'd win.

347
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:00,222
That's amazing.

348
00:12:00,223 --> 00:12:02,222
(Puzzled)

349
00:12:02,223 --> 00:12:04,192
- My brain worked all of a sudden.
- That's amazing.

350
00:12:04,193 --> 00:12:05,791
- You were quick.
- He's good.

351
00:12:05,792 --> 00:12:07,401
- He was very quick.
- What was your guess?

352
00:12:07,402 --> 00:12:08,631
I thought that it was marketing.

353
00:12:08,632 --> 00:12:10,902
- At work...
- My guess was yutnori.

354
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:12,932
It looks dark.

355
00:12:13,103 --> 00:12:14,902
- There's no lighting.
- No.

356
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,802
He filmed it without anything.

357
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:19,472
- They look very awkward.
- The video is lagging.

358
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:20,681
It's because it's old.

359
00:12:20,682 --> 00:12:23,213
Isn't this what we call "drinking show" nowadays?

360
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,483
- Drinking show.
- It's like a drinking show.

361
00:12:26,782 --> 00:12:29,751
- Handsome...
- Guys!

362
00:12:29,752 --> 00:12:30,852
(Handsome Guys)

363
00:12:30,853 --> 00:12:31,853
Come on, man.

364
00:12:34,093 --> 00:12:36,122
- Kyung Ho is impressive.
- We got one.

365
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,092
We're off to a nice start.

366
00:12:38,093 --> 00:12:39,592
- Kyung Ho.
- Thank you.

367
00:12:39,593 --> 00:12:40,638
(Team Handsome won a square right at the start.)

368
00:12:40,662 --> 00:12:41,862
Things are looking difficult today.

369
00:12:41,863 --> 00:12:44,232
The dish for the opening segment is too much.

370
00:12:44,233 --> 00:12:45,333
I'm so jealous.

371
00:12:45,502 --> 00:12:46,809
This is food for the opening segment.

372
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:47,972
(What is it?)

373
00:12:47,973 --> 00:12:49,001
It's chicken soup with nurungji.

374
00:12:49,002 --> 00:12:51,772
(A breakfast meal that no one even imagined)

375
00:12:51,973 --> 00:12:53,819
- What is it?
- It's chicken soup with nurungji.

376
00:12:53,843 --> 00:12:54,912
That sounds nice.

377
00:12:55,382 --> 00:12:57,483
- In the morning?
- That sounds nice.

378
00:12:58,052 --> 00:13:00,681
They'll probably eat, so we'd better hurry...

379
00:13:00,682 --> 00:13:02,353
and get 1 of the 2.

380
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:04,082
Let's go to the nearest place.

381
00:13:04,353 --> 00:13:07,692
- Right, Yangpyeong is the closest.
- Are we here right now?

382
00:13:07,693 --> 00:13:08,693
Yes.

383
00:13:10,522 --> 00:13:12,531
It would feel more refreshing...

384
00:13:12,532 --> 00:13:14,203
to start from the center square.

385
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:16,302
- Shall we go there?
- Yes.

386
00:13:16,502 --> 00:13:17,872
This is our only choice.

387
00:13:17,873 --> 00:13:19,301
After that, we'll put them to sleep and go here.

388
00:13:19,302 --> 00:13:20,373
Okay.

389
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:21,642
Go ahead.

390
00:13:22,473 --> 00:13:23,671
Do that after going to Yangpyeong.

391
00:13:23,672 --> 00:13:24,672
Okay.

392
00:13:25,772 --> 00:13:27,312
It's nice to hear it directly.

393
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:29,083
(Discussing plans with the opposing team)

394
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:30,213
Okay.

395
00:13:30,813 --> 00:13:32,113
- Good luck today.
- Okay.

396
00:13:32,213 --> 00:13:33,551
- Stay strong.
- Have a good trip.

397
00:13:33,552 --> 00:13:34,823
Drive safely.

398
00:13:35,052 --> 00:13:39,953
(The bingo race starts as they wish each other luck.)

399
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,692
Is there no proper road to get there?

400
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:44,392
It's going to take a long time.

401
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:47,532
It only takes 38 minutes...

402
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:49,103
to get to Namyangju.

403
00:13:49,302 --> 00:13:51,203
It takes 40 minutes to get to Yangpyeong.

404
00:13:51,772 --> 00:13:53,102
- From here?
- It's right next to Yangpyeong.

405
00:13:53,103 --> 00:13:54,442
The road must be curvy.

406
00:13:54,443 --> 00:13:56,323
(Today's lesson: Take another look at the map.)

407
00:13:56,843 --> 00:13:59,373
How about going after the horizontal line on top?

408
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:02,112
- These three?
- Yes.

409
00:14:02,113 --> 00:14:03,312
(Cover songs, beauty, and workout)

410
00:14:03,313 --> 00:14:04,913
- Instead of going to Yangpyeong?
- Yes.

411
00:14:05,953 --> 00:14:08,323
- Namyangju, Yangju...
- And Hanam.

412
00:14:08,853 --> 00:14:09,952
These three?

413
00:14:09,953 --> 00:14:10,993
Yes.

414
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:13,421
Let's try the top horizontal squares.

415
00:14:13,422 --> 00:14:14,521
These three.

416
00:14:14,522 --> 00:14:16,292
I think that's better.

417
00:14:17,093 --> 00:14:19,492
I think we're better off going to Namyangju.

418
00:14:19,493 --> 00:14:20,733
Okay.

419
00:14:21,002 --> 00:14:23,932
Also, since it's workout,

420
00:14:24,132 --> 00:14:26,373
- you might have the upper hand.
- For the quiz?

421
00:14:26,603 --> 00:14:27,843
Yes, whatever it may be.

422
00:14:28,142 --> 00:14:30,372
The countryside meal would be something good.

423
00:14:30,373 --> 00:14:31,911
- Just go.
- For breakfast.

424
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:32,942
Hurry up and go.

425
00:14:32,943 --> 00:14:34,342
(Blocking him immediately)

426
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:36,303
Won't it be nice to start after having breakfast?

427
00:14:36,613 --> 00:14:38,713
- They get to eat chicken soup.
- Just go.

428
00:14:38,912 --> 00:14:42,123
A meal with seasoned vegetables from the countryside...

429
00:14:43,052 --> 00:14:45,352
- Hurry up and go.
- I feel cold because I'm hungry.

430
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:47,222
Hurry up and go.

431
00:14:47,223 --> 00:14:48,362
We feel cold because we're starving.

432
00:14:48,363 --> 00:14:49,661
Please go.

433
00:14:49,662 --> 00:14:52,863
When you eat, your body heats up, and you don't feel cold.

434
00:14:53,563 --> 00:14:55,523
Tae Hyun doesn't eat anything throughout the day.

435
00:14:56,502 --> 00:14:58,373
- So you have to help me.
- Okay.

436
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,171
Who will be the workout YouTuber?

437
00:15:04,172 --> 00:15:05,213
I'm curious.

438
00:15:06,642 --> 00:15:08,342
We're going to...

439
00:15:08,343 --> 00:15:09,381
(Sang Uk looks it up right away.)

440
00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:10,483
Namyangju.

441
00:15:11,213 --> 00:15:12,252
Who is it?

442
00:15:12,652 --> 00:15:13,782
"Honggangsa?"

443
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,181
"Honggangsa?"

444
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:16,352
(Who is Honggangsa?)

445
00:15:16,353 --> 00:15:17,722
(Let's see.)

446
00:15:17,723 --> 00:15:20,022
- What's this?
- Honggangsa?

447
00:15:21,123 --> 00:15:22,762
- What?
- It's spinning.

448
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:24,291
- Spinning?
- Yes.

449
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:25,363
Is it cycling?

450
00:15:26,193 --> 00:15:27,761
There are people who cycle...

451
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:29,332
to lose weight.

452
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,813
With music playing in the background.

453
00:15:31,902 --> 00:15:34,103
He's dancing while cycling.

454
00:15:35,542 --> 00:15:36,943
It looks very difficult.

455
00:15:37,073 --> 00:15:39,912
Do we have to defeat him in cycling?

456
00:15:41,343 --> 00:15:43,443
Let's go to Namyangju and answer the quiz.

457
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:46,781
It's important to win Namyangju.

458
00:15:46,782 --> 00:15:48,823
(Whatever the question is, we must get it right.)

459
00:15:49,123 --> 00:15:50,552
We're setting off.

460
00:15:51,022 --> 00:15:52,751
I'm so happy to be on your team.

461
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,921
- Thank you so much.
- You picked us as your team.

462
00:15:54,922 --> 00:15:57,661
You're the best. On top of that, you won something at the start.

463
00:15:57,662 --> 00:15:59,032
Yes, that's exactly it.

464
00:15:59,762 --> 00:16:01,262
Kyung Ho,

465
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,801
for two episodes in a row,

466
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:05,631
I was on the same team as Yi Kyung.

467
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,172
We lost twice in a row.

468
00:16:07,373 --> 00:16:09,102
Last week,

469
00:16:09,103 --> 00:16:11,212
I didn't contribute anything to the team.

470
00:16:11,213 --> 00:16:12,572
So I made a promise to Yi Kyung.

471
00:16:12,573 --> 00:16:14,482
No matter who the opponents are,

472
00:16:14,483 --> 00:16:15,782
I'll tear them down.

473
00:16:16,313 --> 00:16:17,512
Today is the day.

474
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:21,651
Let's make Tae Hyun get the penalty today.

475
00:16:21,652 --> 00:16:23,352
Yes, I feel reassured...

476
00:16:23,353 --> 00:16:25,651
because you two are competent.

477
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:27,292
(He found two reliable younger brothers.)

478
00:16:28,123 --> 00:16:31,891
For the eating show in Pocheon,

479
00:16:31,892 --> 00:16:34,402
I have a friend named Hyo Jun who's a YouTuber.

480
00:16:34,532 --> 00:16:36,501
- Oh, I know him.
- Burger Brother.

481
00:16:36,502 --> 00:16:38,702
Burger Brother Hyo Jun lives in Pocheon.

482
00:16:38,703 --> 00:16:40,203
- He lives in Pocheon?
- Yes.

483
00:16:40,603 --> 00:16:42,472
He was also on "Unexpected Business."

484
00:16:42,473 --> 00:16:44,812
I think it could be Hyo Jun.

485
00:16:44,813 --> 00:16:46,572
- That's possible.
- Yes.

486
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:48,782
Who creates content about unusual animals?

487
00:16:48,912 --> 00:16:50,443
- Jungbrre?
- Jungbrre.

488
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:53,051
My children also like Jungbrre.

489
00:16:53,052 --> 00:16:54,953
Is there someone other than Jungbrre?

490
00:16:56,022 --> 00:16:57,222
- Kyung Ho.
- Yes?

491
00:16:57,223 --> 00:16:59,392
- I think it's Jungbrre.
- Really?

492
00:16:59,422 --> 00:17:01,261
I looked him up, and he lives in Bundang.

493
00:17:01,262 --> 00:17:02,762
Then it must be him.

494
00:17:03,162 --> 00:17:05,092
I'm curious about cover songs, too.

495
00:17:05,093 --> 00:17:06,931
Is it Greg? He's also...

496
00:17:06,932 --> 00:17:08,801
Yes, he sings cover songs.

497
00:17:08,802 --> 00:17:09,901
(Their guessing continues.)

498
00:17:09,902 --> 00:17:11,002
Gosh,

499
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,631
you're so combative.

500
00:17:12,632 --> 00:17:13,833
It's interesting.

501
00:17:15,443 --> 00:17:17,142
(Soon, they arrive at the restaurant.)

502
00:17:18,672 --> 00:17:20,243
Gosh, the view is...

503
00:17:20,912 --> 00:17:24,313
(With frozen Cheongpyeong Lake behind them)

504
00:17:24,453 --> 00:17:27,412
(Chicken soup with nurungji is lying down gently.)

505
00:17:27,623 --> 00:17:29,451
(White meat...)

506
00:17:29,452 --> 00:17:31,592
(and hot broth)

507
00:17:31,593 --> 00:17:34,022
(And savory nurungji)

508
00:17:34,023 --> 00:17:35,462
This is the real kind.

509
00:17:35,692 --> 00:17:37,792
(An invigorating dish for winter, chicken soup with nurungji)

510
00:17:37,793 --> 00:17:39,062
Can we eat it right now?

511
00:17:39,063 --> 00:17:40,362
- Yes.
- We can eat.

512
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:41,662
Let's hurry and eat.

513
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:43,363
We have to eat quickly.

514
00:17:43,902 --> 00:17:45,873
- Have one of these.
- It's okay.

515
00:17:46,073 --> 00:17:47,231
Let's be fair.

516
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,772
- You should be served first.
- Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

517
00:17:48,773 --> 00:17:50,402
- You know what?
- It's okay.

518
00:17:50,472 --> 00:17:51,711
I like chicken breast.

519
00:17:51,712 --> 00:17:52,912
Give him the entire piece.

520
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:54,412
Give him everything.

521
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:56,212
I really like you guys.

522
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,911
You're the first to be served.

523
00:17:57,912 --> 00:18:00,472
I haven't gotten any drumsticks recently because of my children.

524
00:18:01,253 --> 00:18:03,353
- Your daughter?
- No, my son.

525
00:18:04,253 --> 00:18:05,451
Thank you for the drumstick.

526
00:18:05,452 --> 00:18:06,692
Enjoy it.

527
00:18:07,123 --> 00:18:08,161
(Taking a big bite of the meat)

528
00:18:08,162 --> 00:18:10,063
We should...

529
00:18:10,593 --> 00:18:12,661
(Sucking the edge of the bone)

530
00:18:12,662 --> 00:18:13,732
Yes.

531
00:18:14,432 --> 00:18:15,662
This makes me happy.

532
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:23,043
(It's time for the younger ones to taste.)

533
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,513
(Eating)

534
00:18:31,182 --> 00:18:32,253
This makes me happy.

535
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:36,682
Let's enjoy this.

536
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,151
We can't give them time to think.

537
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:40,651
(Team Handsome enjoys their first victory.)

538
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:41,962
It tastes good.

539
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:45,263
We're starting the day with chicken soup with nurungji.

540
00:18:45,492 --> 00:18:48,063
- It eases the stomach.
- Yes, and it gives us energy.

541
00:18:48,132 --> 00:18:50,662
- Nurungji eases the stomach.
- Right.

542
00:18:51,402 --> 00:18:53,102
Seung Ho, I'll go wherever you choose.

543
00:18:53,103 --> 00:18:54,402
Where shall we go? Let's decide.

544
00:18:54,543 --> 00:18:57,813
I think that it's best to go south.

545
00:18:57,873 --> 00:18:59,573
In the end,

546
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:01,582
all the empty squares are in the south.

547
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:04,212
Among Hanam, Yongin, and Seongnam,

548
00:19:04,513 --> 00:19:07,013
where in the south do you want to go?

549
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,722
If we're on the way...

550
00:19:09,882 --> 00:19:11,853
- Hanam?
- Hanam.

551
00:19:11,992 --> 00:19:13,992
(Hanam?)

552
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,392
We'll follow...

553
00:19:15,793 --> 00:19:17,692
Jegal Seung Ho's advice.

554
00:19:18,692 --> 00:19:21,401
We'll go and meet Greg in Hanam.

555
00:19:21,402 --> 00:19:22,901
Okay, that sounds good.

556
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:25,072
- Is Greg in Hanam?
- Yes.

557
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:26,672
I looked it up, and it's Greg.

558
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:29,402
The singing content sounds good.

559
00:19:29,672 --> 00:19:31,512
Isn't it five minutes at maximum?

560
00:19:31,513 --> 00:19:33,211
He'll do most of the recording.

561
00:19:33,212 --> 00:19:34,582
Isn't he older than me?

562
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:35,612
- Greg?
- Yes.

563
00:19:35,613 --> 00:19:37,543
- It's hard to be older than you.
- Really?

564
00:19:40,182 --> 00:19:41,552
I'll look it up.

565
00:19:41,553 --> 00:19:43,181
- What's your age this year?
- I was born in 1980.

566
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,252
- In 1980? That's...
- Yes.

567
00:19:45,253 --> 00:19:47,823
You don't have to be so respectful with me.

568
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:49,992
- Kyung Ho.
- Yes?

569
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,131
Isn't he older than me?

570
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:52,362
He's five years younger than you.

571
00:19:52,363 --> 00:19:53,562
He looks old for his age.

572
00:19:53,563 --> 00:19:55,033
It's because...

573
00:19:55,132 --> 00:19:57,401
- people like him become winners.
- Right.

574
00:19:57,402 --> 00:19:58,672
I also look old for my age.

575
00:19:58,873 --> 00:20:00,373
I've always looked old.

576
00:20:00,803 --> 00:20:02,543
Until Hyun Bong Sik came along.

577
00:20:02,642 --> 00:20:03,902
- Bong Sik?
- Yes.

578
00:20:03,942 --> 00:20:05,112
Bong Sik.

579
00:20:05,113 --> 00:20:07,212
How old do you think Seung Ho and I look?

580
00:20:07,442 --> 00:20:09,241
- I can tell that you're older.
- Yes.

581
00:20:09,242 --> 00:20:11,352
- Seung Ho...
- I look much older than my age.

582
00:20:11,353 --> 00:20:13,052
Were you born...

583
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:14,053
in the 80s?

584
00:20:14,054 --> 00:20:16,222
Just guess when we were born.

585
00:20:16,382 --> 00:20:19,652
- You must have been born in 1985.
- In 1985? And?

586
00:20:19,722 --> 00:20:22,391
- Seung Ho was born in 1987.
- Year 1985 and 1987?

587
00:20:22,392 --> 00:20:23,921
- You were close.
- Really?

588
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:25,992
I was born in 1995.

589
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:27,132
What?

590
00:20:29,902 --> 00:20:31,333
I was born in 1995.

591
00:20:31,402 --> 00:20:33,471
- I was born in 1988.
- Really?

592
00:20:33,472 --> 00:20:35,441
I don't know how old people are.

593
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,701
This is more like...

594
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:37,918
(Their brotherly love is destroyed in an instant.)

595
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:40,572
I can't believe that I thought you were born in 1987.

596
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:41,981
No, it's okay.

597
00:20:41,982 --> 00:20:44,181
- I can't tell people's age.
- I lived my entire life like this.

598
00:20:44,182 --> 00:20:45,182
It's hard for me to tell.

599
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,711
Now, I look closer to my age.

600
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,381
I look closer to my current age than before.

601
00:20:49,382 --> 00:20:52,293
I don't think I'm there yet, but I got closer.

602
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,492
Seung Ho, I like you.

603
00:20:54,722 --> 00:20:57,363
- All of a sudden?
- Yes, I like his personality.

604
00:20:57,492 --> 00:20:59,491
(Seung Ho received a lot of love from Kyung Ho.)

605
00:20:59,492 --> 00:21:00,662
Now,

606
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:04,702
thanks to Kyung Ho, we started well with chicken soup with nurungji.

607
00:21:05,003 --> 00:21:07,503
According to Jegal Seung Ho's order,

608
00:21:07,803 --> 00:21:09,741
- we'll head to Hanam.
- That sounds good.

609
00:21:09,742 --> 00:21:11,372
Let's go to Hanam. Thank you for the food.

610
00:21:11,373 --> 00:21:13,142
- Thank you.
- Great, let's go.

611
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:14,481
(Hanam: Cover)

612
00:21:14,482 --> 00:21:15,681
It's my neighborhood.

613
00:21:15,682 --> 00:21:17,083
(Hanam: Cover)

614
00:21:17,813 --> 00:21:19,982
We're taking a risk from the start.

615
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:21,451
- It seems like...
- Let's go.

616
00:21:21,452 --> 00:21:23,122
- It's workout.
- Since it's workout,

617
00:21:23,123 --> 00:21:26,792
we expect to get the correct answer.

618
00:21:26,793 --> 00:21:28,921
(Optimistic about the quiz)

619
00:21:28,922 --> 00:21:30,622
Sang Uk.

620
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:34,192
Can you take care of it so that I don't have to step up?

621
00:21:34,392 --> 00:21:36,532
I'll take care of anything related to legs.

622
00:21:36,533 --> 00:21:37,772
- You take care of the torso.
- Okay.

623
00:21:37,773 --> 00:21:39,701
(They assign the torso and the legs evenly.)

624
00:21:39,702 --> 00:21:42,572
Since it's spinning, it will be on you.

625
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:45,543
(What type of content creator will they meet first?)

626
00:21:46,672 --> 00:21:49,783
(Namyangju: Workout)

627
00:21:52,783 --> 00:21:57,083
(Someone is waiting for Team Guys.)

628
00:21:57,353 --> 00:22:01,593
(Meanwhile, they changed into workout clothes.)

629
00:22:01,793 --> 00:22:03,273
Aerobic exercise on an empty stomach?

630
00:22:03,492 --> 00:22:05,412
After some aerobic exercise on an empty stomach,

631
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:07,691
I'd like some healthy food.

632
00:22:07,692 --> 00:22:09,602
Yes.

633
00:22:09,603 --> 00:22:12,032
If we succeed, we'll get to eat next.

634
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:13,532
Okay, that sounds good.

635
00:22:13,533 --> 00:22:15,072
- All right.
- We have time to eat?

636
00:22:15,073 --> 00:22:16,972
- Okay.
- I hope we know the answer.

637
00:22:17,603 --> 00:22:19,523
- Is it here?
- We have a good chance this time.

638
00:22:20,113 --> 00:22:21,141
(Exclaiming)

639
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:22,941
- Hello.
- What's this?

640
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:24,212
(Gosh, what's this?)

641
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,107
Hello.

642
00:22:26,108 --> 00:22:27,807
- Hello.
- Hello.

643
00:22:29,337 --> 00:22:31,546
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

644
00:22:31,547 --> 00:22:33,506
- Hello.
- Hello.

645
00:22:33,507 --> 00:22:35,016
- Hello.
- Hello.

646
00:22:35,017 --> 00:22:36,617
On our way here,

647
00:22:36,618 --> 00:22:39,187
- we saw some of your videos.
- Really?

648
00:22:39,188 --> 00:22:40,546
Your content is...

649
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:42,517
- about spinning.
- That's correct.

650
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,457
Could you introduce yourself to our viewers?

651
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,086
- Where do I look?
- This way.

652
00:22:47,087 --> 00:22:48,097
Look at that camera.

653
00:22:48,098 --> 00:22:49,957
Hello, this is fruit with hair.

654
00:22:49,958 --> 00:22:51,667
I'm a spinning instructor named Honggangsa.

655
00:22:51,668 --> 00:22:54,167
(I'm a spinning instructor named Honggangsa.)

656
00:22:54,168 --> 00:22:57,697
(Cheerful music and energetic movements)

657
00:22:57,698 --> 00:23:01,377
(Everything takes place on the bicycle.)

658
00:23:01,378 --> 00:23:02,707
(Spinning means pedaling wheels.)

659
00:23:02,708 --> 00:23:03,976
(By dancing to the music, )

660
00:23:03,977 --> 00:23:06,337
(the workout consists of pedaling on a stationary bicycle.)

661
00:23:06,678 --> 00:23:10,316
(Gaining popularity with dancing that isn't as kind as his face)

662
00:23:10,317 --> 00:23:14,017
(He has 110,000 followers.)

663
00:23:17,057 --> 00:23:20,627
(A spinning instructor, Hong Sa In)

664
00:23:20,628 --> 00:23:21,857
This is Honggangsa.

665
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:23,157
- Right.
- An instructor with hair?

666
00:23:23,158 --> 00:23:25,167
- Fruit with hair.
- Fruit?

667
00:23:25,168 --> 00:23:26,627
- What does that mean?
- Yes.

668
00:23:26,628 --> 00:23:28,937
My spinning style is...

669
00:23:28,938 --> 00:23:31,438
quite juicy.

670
00:23:31,507 --> 00:23:33,937
I call myself fruit with hair,

671
00:23:33,938 --> 00:23:36,807
something you don't want to swallow but spit out.

672
00:23:37,277 --> 00:23:38,997
- Fruit with hair?
- Isn't it a weird name?

673
00:23:39,807 --> 00:23:43,177
I'd like to know how you became a content creator.

674
00:23:43,178 --> 00:23:46,986
My sister filmed a video of my class and uploaded it.

675
00:23:46,987 --> 00:23:49,117
It got ten million views.

676
00:23:49,118 --> 00:23:51,357
- Ten million views?
- That's insane.

677
00:23:51,358 --> 00:23:52,428
Since then...

678
00:23:52,527 --> 00:23:56,657
(Enjoy the video with ten million views.)

679
00:23:56,658 --> 00:23:58,267
(Moving lightly)

680
00:23:59,767 --> 00:24:01,536
(- His dancing is so smooth. - I really want to learn from him.)

681
00:24:01,537 --> 00:24:04,537
(With explosive comments)

682
00:24:05,007 --> 00:24:08,677
(Even liked by Sana of TWICE)

683
00:24:08,678 --> 00:24:12,507
Ever since then, the number of subscribers increased.

684
00:24:12,547 --> 00:24:14,976
Somehow, I ended up...

685
00:24:14,977 --> 00:24:16,177
(Modest)

686
00:24:16,178 --> 00:24:18,087
As someone who does spinning...

687
00:24:18,218 --> 00:24:19,786
As someone who does spinning,

688
00:24:19,787 --> 00:24:21,688
you don't seem to be in shape.

689
00:24:22,118 --> 00:24:23,358
Seriously.

690
00:24:23,658 --> 00:24:25,786
Everyone says that I'm fat.

691
00:24:25,787 --> 00:24:26,927
Aren't you muscular?

692
00:24:26,928 --> 00:24:29,127
Yes, I have muscles too.

693
00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:30,597
Of course, I also have fat.

694
00:24:30,598 --> 00:24:32,598
(I have muscles too. Of course, I also have fat.)

695
00:24:32,628 --> 00:24:36,497
Many of my subscribers think that I'm just fat.

696
00:24:36,598 --> 00:24:39,208
They say that spinning doesn't make you lose weight.

697
00:24:39,368 --> 00:24:41,507
It's hard for me to lose weight,

698
00:24:41,577 --> 00:24:43,177
but it's because I eat a lot.

699
00:24:43,178 --> 00:24:44,336
(Spinning doesn't seem to help with weight loss.)

700
00:24:44,337 --> 00:24:46,546
What do we have to do today?

701
00:24:46,547 --> 00:24:48,917
First of all,

702
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:52,148
I prepared a choreography for you.

703
00:24:52,188 --> 00:24:53,947
You won't just be pedaling.

704
00:24:53,948 --> 00:24:56,857
You'll learn the facial expression and the choreography.

705
00:24:56,858 --> 00:24:58,056
- Facial expression?
- We will?

706
00:24:58,057 --> 00:24:59,357
- Yes.
- Facial expression?

707
00:24:59,358 --> 00:25:01,527
I thought you'd be good at it.

708
00:25:01,557 --> 00:25:03,557
It's not what I expected.

709
00:25:04,198 --> 00:25:05,368
It feels like...

710
00:25:05,567 --> 00:25:07,526
- It feels like...
- I'm bad at dancing.

711
00:25:07,527 --> 00:25:09,066
We are...

712
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:10,367
completely ruined.

713
00:25:10,368 --> 00:25:11,667
(We're ruined.)

714
00:25:11,668 --> 00:25:13,637
After you practice the choreography,

715
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:16,108
we'll shoot a short video of you.

716
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:17,937
Are we making a short video?

717
00:25:17,938 --> 00:25:19,878
(Are we making a short video?)

718
00:25:20,378 --> 00:25:21,546
This is...

719
00:25:21,547 --> 00:25:23,816
It feels strange to have just the bicycle.

720
00:25:23,817 --> 00:25:25,347
Will they watch me from here?

721
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:26,847
- Where shall we stand?
- From the side?

722
00:25:26,848 --> 00:25:30,556
- Please stand at the side.
- Really?

723
00:25:30,557 --> 00:25:31,927
(Moving together)

724
00:25:31,928 --> 00:25:33,056
Thank you.

725
00:25:33,057 --> 00:25:34,086
What's wrong?

726
00:25:34,087 --> 00:25:35,496
Do you feel uncomfortable with us close to you?

727
00:25:35,497 --> 00:25:36,527
Yes.

728
00:25:38,868 --> 00:25:41,497
What kind of director is that?

729
00:25:41,737 --> 00:25:44,098
Sometimes, I get reality checks.

730
00:25:44,297 --> 00:25:45,467
- That's why.
- Really?

731
00:25:45,468 --> 00:25:47,438
One moment, please.

732
00:25:47,638 --> 00:25:49,177
(Please, spinning deity...)

733
00:25:49,178 --> 00:25:51,276
- Okay.
- Today's choreography is easy.

734
00:25:51,277 --> 00:25:53,947
It's mostly about the facial expression.

735
00:25:53,948 --> 00:25:55,247
(At ease)

736
00:26:00,348 --> 00:26:01,888
(Pedaling explosively)

737
00:26:02,218 --> 00:26:03,756
That's already difficult.

738
00:26:03,757 --> 00:26:04,987
That's the basic movement.

739
00:26:06,188 --> 00:26:07,188
What's that?

740
00:26:08,658 --> 00:26:11,898
(Doing body rolls easily while pedaling)

741
00:26:13,868 --> 00:26:14,868
That's...

742
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:18,337
(Unlike the look on his face, the movements are intense.)

743
00:26:19,237 --> 00:26:20,766
He puts his head down a lot.

744
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:22,306
(You get a lot of workout from dancing to the music.)

745
00:26:22,307 --> 00:26:24,147
It's fascinating how he doesn't bump his head.

746
00:26:24,178 --> 00:26:25,547
His head barely avoids...

747
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:28,648
I'm afraid he'll bump his head, but he doesn't.

748
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,347
(Change of songs)

749
00:26:31,348 --> 00:26:33,188
This is the second song.

750
00:26:33,388 --> 00:26:35,817
(Speeding up)

751
00:26:37,517 --> 00:26:39,658
(Refreshing)

752
00:26:39,987 --> 00:26:41,087
It changed.

753
00:26:42,497 --> 00:26:44,858
(Watching blankly)

754
00:26:49,098 --> 00:26:50,098
(Working hard to follow)

755
00:26:50,099 --> 00:26:51,537
(The older members are out of it.)

756
00:26:52,807 --> 00:26:53,907
Look at that.

757
00:26:53,908 --> 00:26:55,407
(Flashy)

758
00:26:55,408 --> 00:26:57,036
That part is so hard.

759
00:26:57,037 --> 00:26:58,977
(Overwhelmed by the refreshing beauty)

760
00:26:59,547 --> 00:27:02,576
(Making a clear finishing pose)

761
00:27:02,577 --> 00:27:04,347
Every movement is hard to remember.

762
00:27:04,348 --> 00:27:05,517
How will we memorize this?

763
00:27:05,587 --> 00:27:06,786
And you call this easy?

764
00:27:06,787 --> 00:27:08,187
How can we do this?

765
00:27:08,188 --> 00:27:09,317
You call this easy?

766
00:27:09,688 --> 00:27:11,958
It's definitely aerobic exercise.

767
00:27:12,428 --> 00:27:15,056
- When you move abruptly, - Right.

768
00:27:15,057 --> 00:27:17,697
It also requires muscular strength.

769
00:27:17,698 --> 00:27:19,496
I totally agree.

770
00:27:19,497 --> 00:27:20,826
(Respect)

771
00:27:20,827 --> 00:27:23,536
(Handsome Guys)

772
00:27:23,537 --> 00:27:24,938
I can't do it.

773
00:27:25,567 --> 00:27:28,036
Gosh, this is really fast.

774
00:27:28,037 --> 00:27:30,137
(The look on his face is rotten fruit.)

775
00:27:30,138 --> 00:27:32,076
Now, you will learn...

776
00:27:32,077 --> 00:27:33,506
about spinning.

777
00:27:33,507 --> 00:27:36,516
I'll start by explaining how to pedal.

778
00:27:36,517 --> 00:27:39,687
Do you see the horn-like ends on the handlebar?

779
00:27:39,688 --> 00:27:40,817
Grab those.

780
00:27:43,557 --> 00:27:44,957
Put the foot in the front.

781
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:46,387
Put the left foot in the front.

782
00:27:46,388 --> 00:27:47,957
(Place the feet front and back.)

783
00:27:47,958 --> 00:27:50,027
Straighten the knee and get up.

784
00:27:50,757 --> 00:27:52,097
When you look down,

785
00:27:52,098 --> 00:27:54,598
the pedal will go down in the 6 o'clock direction.

786
00:27:54,698 --> 00:27:57,497
At the same time, the crown of your head touches the ceiling.

787
00:27:57,938 --> 00:28:00,438
We'll alternate the feet and do it slowly.

788
00:28:00,608 --> 00:28:02,536
Do it while following my count.

789
00:28:02,537 --> 00:28:04,336
Three, two, one, go.

790
00:28:04,337 --> 00:28:06,277
One, two, three, four,

791
00:28:06,448 --> 00:28:08,108
five, six, seven, eight.

792
00:28:08,277 --> 00:28:09,877
Don't move your torso from side to side.

793
00:28:09,948 --> 00:28:11,316
You can move it up and down.

794
00:28:11,317 --> 00:28:12,447
The top of your head goes up.

795
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:13,887
Can you wave at the same time?

796
00:28:13,888 --> 00:28:15,858
Hello.

797
00:28:16,317 --> 00:28:18,358
That's it. Wave with the other hand.

798
00:28:18,628 --> 00:28:21,557
(Hello, viewers.)

799
00:28:21,898 --> 00:28:23,958
Try moving it up and down.

800
00:28:24,358 --> 00:28:25,967
Do a sexy body roll.

801
00:28:25,968 --> 00:28:27,398
(This one, too?)

802
00:28:28,337 --> 00:28:29,368
- Gosh.
- All right.

803
00:28:29,898 --> 00:28:32,108
(A body roll?)

804
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:35,878
(Squeaking)

805
00:28:36,378 --> 00:28:37,477
You're doing well.

806
00:28:38,848 --> 00:28:41,948
I'll show you how to do a body roll.

807
00:28:42,178 --> 00:28:44,418
What do you think a body roll is?

808
00:28:44,777 --> 00:28:46,417
- Flowing like a wave.
- Like this?

809
00:28:46,418 --> 00:28:49,057
It has to look a little sexy.

810
00:28:49,218 --> 00:28:52,187
Imagine a cylinder in front of you.

811
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,858
You have to go through it.

812
00:28:54,527 --> 00:28:57,098
Lift up your head and push your chest forward.

813
00:28:57,797 --> 00:28:58,996
Push like this.

814
00:28:58,997 --> 00:29:00,297
(It's simple.)

815
00:29:00,628 --> 00:29:01,767
Push like this.

816
00:29:04,898 --> 00:29:08,607
(The same movement that looks completely different)

817
00:29:08,608 --> 00:29:10,137
You have hair.

818
00:29:10,138 --> 00:29:13,108
It's like throwing your hair back.

819
00:29:14,577 --> 00:29:15,678
That's it.

820
00:29:16,118 --> 00:29:18,276
If you make a sound effect,

821
00:29:18,277 --> 00:29:20,247
it will look closer to a body roll.

822
00:29:20,348 --> 00:29:21,547
Say "Ooh."

823
00:29:21,787 --> 00:29:23,757
Three, two, one, go.

824
00:29:23,987 --> 00:29:24,987
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

825
00:29:24,987 --> 00:29:25,987
That's it.

826
00:29:25,988 --> 00:29:27,457
This is the front body roll.

827
00:29:27,458 --> 00:29:28,627
You got it, right?

828
00:29:28,628 --> 00:29:30,897
(Basics of spinning: 1. Pedaling, 2. Body rolls)

829
00:29:30,898 --> 00:29:33,027
Next, you'll learn a movement.

830
00:29:33,168 --> 00:29:34,327
What's this?

831
00:29:34,727 --> 00:29:35,967
- A rectangle.
- Yes, a rectangle.

832
00:29:35,968 --> 00:29:37,236
This is what you'll learn.

833
00:29:37,237 --> 00:29:39,307
You'll draw a rectangle with your upper body.

834
00:29:39,537 --> 00:29:41,168
One, two, three, four,

835
00:29:41,267 --> 00:29:42,807
five, six, seven, eight.

836
00:29:42,977 --> 00:29:44,677
Let's go to this side first.

837
00:29:44,678 --> 00:29:45,707
- Start.
- This way?

838
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:47,668
- One, two, three, four, - One, two, three, four,

839
00:29:47,708 --> 00:29:49,347
- five, six, seven, eight.
- five, six, seven, eight.

840
00:29:49,348 --> 00:29:52,986
Drawing a rectangle with your upper body is called...

841
00:29:52,987 --> 00:29:54,287
a square.

842
00:29:54,517 --> 00:29:55,517
And so...

843
00:29:56,087 --> 00:29:58,256
I did it for two counts.

844
00:29:58,257 --> 00:29:59,858
Let's try for one count. Go.

845
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:01,726
One, two, three, four.

846
00:30:01,727 --> 00:30:02,756
That's it.

847
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:04,496
- You're in sync.
- Gosh.

848
00:30:04,497 --> 00:30:05,967
- You're in sync.
- You did a great job.

849
00:30:05,968 --> 00:30:06,968
All right.

850
00:30:07,628 --> 00:30:08,836
How can we do it while pedaling?

851
00:30:08,837 --> 00:30:10,467
- This is...
- While pedaling?

852
00:30:10,468 --> 00:30:11,907
Yes, while pedaling.

853
00:30:11,908 --> 00:30:13,507
That's it. Okay.

854
00:30:13,968 --> 00:30:17,276
(Disorderly)

855
00:30:17,277 --> 00:30:19,577
- It's so difficult.
- The direction is important.

856
00:30:19,848 --> 00:30:21,447
The direction is important.

857
00:30:21,448 --> 00:30:22,648
If we make a mistake...

858
00:30:22,747 --> 00:30:24,077
Can you do it with me? Start.

859
00:30:27,948 --> 00:30:29,086
It'd be so embarrassing.

860
00:30:29,087 --> 00:30:30,917
(Giggling)

861
00:30:30,918 --> 00:30:32,257
It'd be so embarrassing.

862
00:30:32,388 --> 00:30:33,586
- It's embarrassing.
- Right.

863
00:30:33,587 --> 00:30:34,827
It'd be so awkward.

864
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,657
Some people had flings at my gym...

865
00:30:36,658 --> 00:30:38,726
after looking in the same direction.

866
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:40,297
Be careful with the direction.

867
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:42,638
- It shouldn't overlap.
- You could have a fling.

868
00:30:42,868 --> 00:30:44,543
We'll be in trouble if we look at each other.

869
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:45,667
Goodness.

870
00:30:45,668 --> 00:30:48,576
Let's try once this way and once the other way.

871
00:30:48,577 --> 00:30:50,777
Start.

872
00:30:50,908 --> 00:30:51,977
One...

873
00:30:52,307 --> 00:30:54,077
I'm sorry. It's my mistake.

874
00:30:54,977 --> 00:30:56,017
One...

875
00:30:56,378 --> 00:30:58,148
I'm sorry. It's my mistake.

876
00:30:58,418 --> 00:30:59,617
Don't start a fling.

877
00:30:59,618 --> 00:31:01,086
- All right.
- From the right?

878
00:31:01,087 --> 00:31:02,087
This way.

879
00:31:02,087 --> 00:31:03,087
- This way?
- I see.

880
00:31:03,088 --> 00:31:04,957
- From this side, 1, 2, 3, 4, - This side?

881
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:06,533
- five, six, seven, eight.
- How about this side?

882
00:31:06,557 --> 00:31:07,557
Go.

883
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:09,597
- One, two, three, four, - Three, four.

884
00:31:09,598 --> 00:31:11,657
- five, six, seven, eight.
- Six, seven, eight.

885
00:31:11,658 --> 00:31:12,844
- That's good. Go.
- This way...

886
00:31:12,868 --> 00:31:14,267
What is this movement called?

887
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,967
- Square.
- Square.

888
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:19,307
I'll show you the choreography for "Barbie Girl."

889
00:31:19,468 --> 00:31:21,668
The facial expression is the most important.

890
00:31:21,878 --> 00:31:24,637
While acting superficial,

891
00:31:24,638 --> 00:31:27,378
you have to smile with your eyes.

892
00:31:28,208 --> 00:31:31,017
(Superficial)

893
00:31:31,517 --> 00:31:33,486
- They're good.
- Okay, that's very good.

894
00:31:33,487 --> 00:31:34,948
You're doing a great job.

895
00:31:35,087 --> 00:31:36,657
Move your shoulders a little.

896
00:31:36,658 --> 00:31:37,658
Like this.

897
00:31:37,958 --> 00:31:40,127
The shoulders get closer to the chin.

898
00:31:40,128 --> 00:31:42,627
(Moving lightly)

899
00:31:42,628 --> 00:31:44,397
That's it.

900
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:45,628
I'm left-handed.

901
00:31:46,628 --> 00:31:48,197
(There was hardly any effect.)

902
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:49,297
Start.

903
00:31:49,468 --> 00:31:51,638
Point. Rock and paper.

904
00:31:51,837 --> 00:31:53,837
- Point and shake.
- And?

905
00:31:54,468 --> 00:31:56,077
Yes. The hand comes next.

906
00:31:56,277 --> 00:31:57,337
Neither this...

907
00:31:57,977 --> 00:31:59,247
nor that.

908
00:32:00,577 --> 00:32:01,746
Neither this nor that.

909
00:32:01,747 --> 00:32:02,747
(Staring)

910
00:32:02,748 --> 00:32:04,447
Yes, do it twice.

911
00:32:04,448 --> 00:32:05,587
I'm sorry,

912
00:32:06,348 --> 00:32:07,747
but are you looking at the camera?

913
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,287
- What?
- Why do I keep looking at it?

914
00:32:10,557 --> 00:32:12,187
Why do you?

915
00:32:12,188 --> 00:32:13,557
Because you were a singer.

916
00:32:14,757 --> 00:32:17,697
(While going over the choreography)

917
00:32:17,698 --> 00:32:19,298
- From there...
- Neither this nor that.

918
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,598
(While Sang Uk and Dong Hyun look at the instructor)

919
00:32:24,398 --> 00:32:26,637
(Acting cute)

920
00:32:26,638 --> 00:32:29,878
(His eyes are fixed.)

921
00:32:31,077 --> 00:32:33,878
(You can feel his eyes from far away.)

922
00:32:34,977 --> 00:32:37,047
(He even acts for his fans.)

923
00:32:37,618 --> 00:32:39,316
- I only see the instructor.
- It's because...

924
00:32:39,317 --> 00:32:41,717
he was a singer. He does it instinctively.

925
00:32:41,718 --> 00:32:43,256
Why do I keep looking...

926
00:32:43,257 --> 00:32:44,756
(That's how to become the master of spinning.)

927
00:32:44,757 --> 00:32:47,827
- Full of wounds.
- Wounds.

928
00:32:48,057 --> 00:32:49,297
A body roll.

929
00:32:49,628 --> 00:32:51,557
(Working hard)

930
00:32:51,757 --> 00:32:53,868
Toss your hair back. Push up.

931
00:32:54,128 --> 00:32:56,198
- One, two, three, four.
- One, two, three, four.

932
00:32:56,237 --> 00:32:58,138
Do the other side once.

933
00:32:58,237 --> 00:33:00,036
A body roll.

934
00:33:00,037 --> 00:33:02,108
(They're fully ready.)

935
00:33:02,408 --> 00:33:03,677
Here we go. Action.

936
00:33:03,678 --> 00:33:06,177
(The final rehearsal before shooting the short video)

937
00:33:06,178 --> 00:33:08,148
Ready, set, go. One, two.

938
00:33:10,948 --> 00:33:12,388
Lift the chin.

939
00:33:12,587 --> 00:33:14,847
(They start off smoothly.)

940
00:33:14,848 --> 00:33:15,888
Your hair.

941
00:33:19,287 --> 00:33:21,556
(Perfectly in sync)

942
00:33:21,557 --> 00:33:24,158
Do a body roll and wait.

943
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,928
A body roll. Point.

944
00:33:28,368 --> 00:33:30,296
A body roll. Say cheese.

945
00:33:30,297 --> 00:33:31,497
(Tae Hyun makes a mistake.)

946
00:33:31,498 --> 00:33:32,667
- Cheese.
- A body roll.

947
00:33:32,908 --> 00:33:34,067
- Point.
- Point.

948
00:33:34,337 --> 00:33:35,707
- This is good.
- A body roll.

949
00:33:36,107 --> 00:33:37,308
Say cheese.

950
00:33:38,777 --> 00:33:40,507
Keep pedaling.

951
00:33:40,607 --> 00:33:42,447
(They finished "Barbie Girl" without making huge mistakes.)

952
00:33:42,448 --> 00:33:43,847
- What's next?
- Now,

953
00:33:43,848 --> 00:33:45,178
we're going to poke.

954
00:33:45,348 --> 00:33:46,647
Three, two, poke.

955
00:33:49,788 --> 00:33:51,017
(Making mistakes endlessly)

956
00:33:51,018 --> 00:33:52,158
Draw a rectangle.

957
00:33:53,487 --> 00:33:54,487
Neither this.

958
00:33:55,228 --> 00:33:56,257
Neither this.

959
00:33:58,598 --> 00:33:59,598
Neither this.

960
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:04,397
(Struggling)

961
00:34:04,737 --> 00:34:06,736
Here we go. Your hands.

962
00:34:06,737 --> 00:34:08,006
(Team Guys collapses at the end.)

963
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:09,078
Square.

964
00:34:11,377 --> 00:34:12,448
One more time.

965
00:34:13,207 --> 00:34:14,677
(Team Guys works hard to draw rectangles.)

966
00:34:14,678 --> 00:34:15,678
Pose for the camera.

967
00:34:16,047 --> 00:34:17,877
(The end that they've been waiting for)

968
00:34:17,978 --> 00:34:19,316
(Cha Tae Hyun, leader who's popular among fans)

969
00:34:19,317 --> 00:34:20,717
(Kim Dong Hyun, main rapper)

970
00:34:20,718 --> 00:34:23,657
(Oh Sang Uk, the one with looks, fencer)

971
00:34:23,658 --> 00:34:25,086
- I got it all wrong.
- I'm tired.

972
00:34:25,087 --> 00:34:26,228
I got it all wrong.

973
00:34:26,828 --> 00:34:27,857
This is...

974
00:34:28,457 --> 00:34:30,727
(It isn't easy.)

975
00:34:30,728 --> 00:34:31,728
It isn't easy.

976
00:34:31,729 --> 00:34:33,897
- If we practice...
- My legs hurt.

977
00:34:34,428 --> 00:34:35,967
If we practice three more times, we'll be in sync.

978
00:34:35,968 --> 00:34:36,968
Gosh.

979
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:38,768
(Feeling regretful)

980
00:34:39,567 --> 00:34:40,836
(Practicing)

981
00:34:40,837 --> 00:34:42,178
This is intense.

982
00:34:43,408 --> 00:34:44,728
Tae Hyun is having fun right now.

983
00:34:45,178 --> 00:34:46,448
He's really having fun.

984
00:34:46,678 --> 00:34:47,977
Whenever I listened to people explaining,

985
00:34:47,978 --> 00:34:49,317
he scolded me.

986
00:34:49,448 --> 00:34:51,646
He told me to stop listening, but today...

987
00:34:51,647 --> 00:34:53,287
he said, "We just need to practice three more times."

988
00:34:53,288 --> 00:34:54,288
(It made Dong Hyun feel sad.)

989
00:34:54,289 --> 00:34:55,957
He's having a lot of fun.

990
00:34:57,487 --> 00:34:58,618
Let's get ready.

991
00:35:00,527 --> 00:35:01,727
(The YouTube channel filming team)

992
00:35:01,728 --> 00:35:03,026
(The shoot finally starts.)

993
00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:04,057
Start.

994
00:35:04,058 --> 00:35:06,067
(The shoot finally starts.)

995
00:35:07,127 --> 00:35:09,097
Lift your chin. Move your shoulders.

996
00:35:09,098 --> 00:35:11,537
(Check out the spinning short video on Hong Sa In's channel.)

997
00:35:11,538 --> 00:35:12,607
Toss your hair back.

998
00:35:12,937 --> 00:35:15,837
(Team Handsome)

999
00:35:17,678 --> 00:35:18,978
Jegal Seung Ho is...

1000
00:35:19,308 --> 00:35:20,848
I'm lost in thought.

1001
00:35:21,848 --> 00:35:23,847
Seung Ho, once we clear...

1002
00:35:23,848 --> 00:35:26,117
the mission in Hanam, where should we go next?

1003
00:35:26,118 --> 00:35:28,417
That's what I was thinking about.

1004
00:35:28,547 --> 00:35:30,218
If we win Hanam,

1005
00:35:30,518 --> 00:35:32,828
- the horizontal line on top...
- Right.

1006
00:35:33,457 --> 00:35:35,728
Team Guys...

1007
00:35:36,027 --> 00:35:37,727
can't complete the bingo on that line.

1008
00:35:37,728 --> 00:35:38,728
Right.

1009
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,968
Let's say that the other team gets Yangpyeong.

1010
00:35:43,237 --> 00:35:45,467
They'll go for Namyangju, Yangpyeong, and Yongin.

1011
00:35:45,468 --> 00:35:47,006
(Team Guys will aim for the diagonal bingo.)

1012
00:35:47,007 --> 00:35:49,206
That's why it'll be right for us...

1013
00:35:49,207 --> 00:35:51,376
to go to Hanam and then Yongin.

1014
00:35:51,377 --> 00:35:52,408
That'd be our plan.

1015
00:35:53,078 --> 00:35:55,847
If the timing is right and we get lucky,

1016
00:35:55,848 --> 00:35:57,876
we could end the game by getting Seongnam A.

1017
00:35:57,877 --> 00:35:58,887
Exactly.

1018
00:35:58,888 --> 00:35:59,968
(Hanam, Seongnam A, Yongin)

1019
00:36:00,087 --> 00:36:02,357
They don't call you Jegal Seung Ho for no reason.

1020
00:36:02,718 --> 00:36:04,357
The opposing team...

1021
00:36:04,487 --> 00:36:05,857
They'll be gagged.

1022
00:36:07,728 --> 00:36:09,728
Once they're gagged, we'll take them by the reins.

1023
00:36:10,257 --> 00:36:12,828
They'll go left if we tell them to...

1024
00:36:12,868 --> 00:36:14,567
and go back if ordered.

1025
00:36:15,268 --> 00:36:17,567
- Hence the nickname.
- Right.

1026
00:36:17,698 --> 00:36:19,437
Jegal means "to gag someone."

1027
00:36:19,567 --> 00:36:21,006
It shows how clever he is.

1028
00:36:21,007 --> 00:36:22,106
I see.

1029
00:36:22,107 --> 00:36:23,206
(The master who controls the entire bingo board)

1030
00:36:23,207 --> 00:36:24,637
I just do as Seung Ho says.

1031
00:36:24,638 --> 00:36:27,007
(Team Handsome keeps on riding out.)

1032
00:36:28,817 --> 00:36:32,117
This is Greg's office in Hanam.

1033
00:36:32,118 --> 00:36:33,118
(Hanam: Cover)

1034
00:36:33,888 --> 00:36:35,517
This is the recording studio.

1035
00:36:35,518 --> 00:36:36,657
(They arrive at a recording studio in Hanam.)

1036
00:36:36,658 --> 00:36:37,718
Excuse me.

1037
00:36:39,728 --> 00:36:40,888
(What?)

1038
00:36:43,328 --> 00:36:46,728
(The memories of being hopelessly in love with you)

1039
00:36:46,968 --> 00:36:48,767
(He greets the man with a song.)

1040
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:50,336
- It's been a while.
- Do you remember me?

1041
00:36:50,337 --> 00:36:51,396
Sure. It's been so long.

1042
00:36:51,397 --> 00:36:52,407
It's been a while.

1043
00:36:52,408 --> 00:36:54,066
- Hello.
- Hi, it's nice to meet you.

1044
00:36:54,067 --> 00:36:55,267
You're so cool.

1045
00:36:55,268 --> 00:36:56,436
- Hello.
- Hi.

1046
00:36:56,437 --> 00:36:57,776
Greg, do you know who they all are?

1047
00:36:57,777 --> 00:36:58,847
Of course.

1048
00:36:58,848 --> 00:37:00,647
Let's all sit down first.

1049
00:37:01,377 --> 00:37:03,816
It's been a while, but you look even better.

1050
00:37:03,817 --> 00:37:06,816
Really? Hello, I'm singer Greg.

1051
00:37:06,817 --> 00:37:08,118
It's good to see you.

1052
00:37:08,888 --> 00:37:10,087
It's been a while.

1053
00:37:10,388 --> 00:37:12,087
I'm a foreigner living in Korea.

1054
00:37:14,658 --> 00:37:18,127
(He became famous for his soulful cover of "I Miss You.")

1055
00:37:18,498 --> 00:37:20,498
(The memories)

1056
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,296
(Apart from that, he covered...)

1057
00:37:25,297 --> 00:37:27,707
(Korean songs of various genres in his own style.)

1058
00:37:29,737 --> 00:37:32,646
(When that day comes again someday)

1059
00:37:32,647 --> 00:37:34,646
(You're the best. Please sing for us for decades to come.)

1060
00:37:34,647 --> 00:37:35,677
(Is there a foreigner...)

1061
00:37:35,678 --> 00:37:36,717
(who can sing the emotions of Korean songs any better?)

1062
00:37:36,718 --> 00:37:38,816
(Your voice touches the heart. Thank you for singing Korean songs.)

1063
00:37:38,817 --> 00:37:40,686
(I choked up listening to you sing. You have an incredible voice.)

1064
00:37:40,687 --> 00:37:42,963
(I clicked on the video by mistake, but I haven't been able to leave.)

1065
00:37:42,987 --> 00:37:45,887
How have you been since we last met?

1066
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:48,558
I love how people still remember me.

1067
00:37:49,158 --> 00:37:50,296
Even these days,

1068
00:37:50,297 --> 00:37:51,396
when I walk into a restroom...

1069
00:37:51,397 --> 00:37:52,928
(The memories of)

1070
00:37:52,968 --> 00:37:55,998
I'm grateful to still have so many fans.

1071
00:37:56,337 --> 00:37:58,198
How many subscribers do you have?

1072
00:37:58,297 --> 00:38:02,336
I think I have between 500,000 to 600,000 subscribers.

1073
00:38:02,337 --> 00:38:03,637
(Wow)

1074
00:38:03,638 --> 00:38:05,336
Maybe it's because it's been a while, but you're sweating.

1075
00:38:05,337 --> 00:38:07,808
- I know.
- Anyway,

1076
00:38:08,047 --> 00:38:11,248
we'd love to hear you sing something live.

1077
00:38:11,377 --> 00:38:14,316
I'm sure the viewers want to hear your soulful voice.

1078
00:38:14,317 --> 00:38:16,917
I've been working on a new cover song,

1079
00:38:17,018 --> 00:38:18,287
but I haven't practiced it a lot.

1080
00:38:18,288 --> 00:38:20,927
I've tried it about three times.

1081
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,727
We'll listen to him sing inside the booth.

1082
00:38:22,728 --> 00:38:24,227
Really? Will we get to hear it?

1083
00:38:24,228 --> 00:38:25,626
- Yes.
- All right.

1084
00:38:25,627 --> 00:38:27,444
(Only Team Handsome will get to hear the cover song he's working on.)

1085
00:38:27,468 --> 00:38:29,268
- No way.
- I'd love to record something too.

1086
00:38:29,737 --> 00:38:32,468
I can't believe I'm getting to hear Greg sing in person.

1087
00:38:33,408 --> 00:38:35,538
(Getting ready to have their ears blessed)

1088
00:38:37,437 --> 00:38:39,007
(Wiping)

1089
00:38:39,647 --> 00:38:42,107
(Singing)

1090
00:38:42,618 --> 00:38:45,417
(He briefly warms up his voice.)

1091
00:38:46,248 --> 00:38:48,587
- We'll check the mic.
- Sure.

1092
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,817
What will he sing for us?

1093
00:38:56,698 --> 00:38:58,618
(His soulful voice is evident in the first bar.)

1094
00:39:02,228 --> 00:39:05,437
(His voice is alive as he hits each note.)

1095
00:39:05,538 --> 00:39:06,968
(Goosebumps)

1096
00:39:07,507 --> 00:39:08,706
This sounds like the original.

1097
00:39:08,707 --> 00:39:09,777
(Thumbs-up!)

1098
00:39:09,937 --> 00:39:11,606
I say this cautiously,

1099
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:13,348
but Bruno Mars should be worried.

1100
00:39:14,647 --> 00:39:15,947
We'll hear you when you're ready.

1101
00:39:15,948 --> 00:39:16,978
(He's in love with Greg.)

1102
00:39:17,178 --> 00:39:18,447
I'll turn number three on...

1103
00:39:18,448 --> 00:39:19,816
- and record the session.
- Sure.

1104
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:20,888
He'll be singing "APT."

1105
00:39:22,018 --> 00:39:23,086
("APT." covered by Greg, )

1106
00:39:23,087 --> 00:39:24,157
(original song by Rose and Bruno Mars)

1107
00:39:24,158 --> 00:39:25,317
The song's known worldwide.

1108
00:39:28,257 --> 00:39:29,698
(APT.)

1109
00:39:29,857 --> 00:39:31,497
(APT.)

1110
00:39:31,498 --> 00:39:33,127
(The APT. dance)

1111
00:39:44,737 --> 00:39:47,308
(Kyung Ho has fallen for Greg.)

1112
00:39:55,187 --> 00:39:56,187
(A mistake!)

1113
00:40:01,627 --> 00:40:03,356
(His soulful voice slaps you in the face.)

1114
00:40:03,357 --> 00:40:04,797
What on earth?

1115
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:06,927
(They can't help but laugh to show their joy.)

1116
00:40:06,928 --> 00:40:08,566
How can he sing...

1117
00:40:08,567 --> 00:40:09,767
every single note like that?

1118
00:40:09,768 --> 00:40:11,728
This is what they mean by playing with the notes.

1119
00:40:16,707 --> 00:40:19,678
(Turn this apartment into a club)

1120
00:40:23,018 --> 00:40:25,218
(Cheers! Girl, what's up?)

1121
00:40:26,087 --> 00:40:28,987
(Ears focused.)

1122
00:40:41,027 --> 00:40:43,538
(The section for vocal ad-libs)

1123
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:44,737
(Ad-libs)

1124
00:40:52,207 --> 00:40:54,478
(Call me the Master of Soul.)

1125
00:40:54,607 --> 00:40:56,523
(The apartment was reconstructed in Greg's style.)

1126
00:40:56,547 --> 00:40:57,618
That was incredible.

1127
00:40:58,718 --> 00:40:59,887
- No way.
- Go, Greg.

1128
00:40:59,888 --> 00:41:02,218
- Bravo.
- I could've done better.

1129
00:41:02,888 --> 00:41:03,888
Have a seat.

1130
00:41:04,417 --> 00:41:06,727
- That was the best.
- Thanks for letting me hear that.

1131
00:41:06,728 --> 00:41:08,186
- Bring your seat over here.
- That was me practicing.

1132
00:41:08,187 --> 00:41:09,197
(Touched)

1133
00:41:09,198 --> 00:41:11,197
I can't say it's perfect yet,

1134
00:41:11,198 --> 00:41:13,597
but I've been working on it.

1135
00:41:13,598 --> 00:41:15,526
So what will Team Handsome...

1136
00:41:15,527 --> 00:41:17,468
be doing with you to create content?

1137
00:41:18,268 --> 00:41:21,468
- Our content for today is...
- Yes?

1138
00:41:21,507 --> 00:41:23,454
I'd like us to come up with a jingle for Team Handsome.

1139
00:41:23,478 --> 00:41:24,538
- Really?
- Yes.

1140
00:41:24,837 --> 00:41:25,847
(No way)

1141
00:41:25,848 --> 00:41:27,478
We just have the song at the moment.

1142
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:29,718
Could you perhaps sing it...

1143
00:41:30,417 --> 00:41:31,678
in my style?

1144
00:41:33,587 --> 00:41:35,288
Are you actually going to air this on TV?

1145
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:37,817
- If it turns out all right.
- You can do it.

1146
00:41:37,957 --> 00:41:41,228
He's here as a guest today. If he sings the jingle for us...

1147
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,157
- Will my voice always be aired?
- Yes.

1148
00:41:44,158 --> 00:41:45,456
- Be relaxed.
- Right.

1149
00:41:45,457 --> 00:41:48,267
- It's the song you wrote.
- That's right.

1150
00:41:48,268 --> 00:41:50,197
Can we first hear it?

1151
00:41:50,198 --> 00:41:51,296
- The demo.
- Right.

1152
00:41:51,297 --> 00:41:52,737
Could we listen to the demo?

1153
00:41:53,124 --> 00:41:54,962
(Team Guys)

1154
00:41:54,963 --> 00:41:56,283
- My gosh.
- That was exhausting.

1155
00:41:56,434 --> 00:41:57,594
I'm exhausted.

1156
00:41:57,764 --> 00:41:59,562
- Good job, guys.
- You too.

1157
00:41:59,563 --> 00:42:01,243
- Good job.
- I only have respect for you.

1158
00:42:01,764 --> 00:42:03,473
- Soon...
- Utter respect.

1159
00:42:03,474 --> 00:42:05,873
- My team will contact you.
- Dong Hyun...

1160
00:42:05,874 --> 00:42:08,704
Subscribe, hit like, and turn on the alarm.

1161
00:42:08,744 --> 00:42:09,773
What was that?

1162
00:42:10,514 --> 00:42:11,942
Here's your question.

1163
00:42:11,943 --> 00:42:13,443
(Time for Quiz)

1164
00:42:13,514 --> 00:42:16,082
Spinning is known as a full-body exercise...

1165
00:42:16,083 --> 00:42:18,054
that promotes weight-loss.

1166
00:42:18,983 --> 00:42:21,422
During the Renaissance,

1167
00:42:21,423 --> 00:42:24,123
it was the men who were more passionate...

1168
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,724
about losing weight.

1169
00:42:26,394 --> 00:42:28,324
But why?

1170
00:42:28,724 --> 00:42:30,563
Isn't it a multiple choice question?

1171
00:42:30,963 --> 00:42:32,123
It's a short-answer question.

1172
00:42:32,293 --> 00:42:34,103
The reason the men tried to lose weight?

1173
00:42:34,764 --> 00:42:37,732
From what I know, the Renaissance...

1174
00:42:37,733 --> 00:42:40,002
was a period...

1175
00:42:40,003 --> 00:42:42,304
rich with food that had good years of harvest.

1176
00:42:43,043 --> 00:42:44,213
It's true, so...

1177
00:42:44,744 --> 00:42:46,283
Since they got bigger in size,

1178
00:42:46,284 --> 00:42:49,613
shedding the weight made them more charming...

1179
00:42:49,614 --> 00:42:50,614
and popular.

1180
00:42:50,753 --> 00:42:51,784
I think...

1181
00:42:51,813 --> 00:42:53,283
I think it has to do with battles.

1182
00:42:53,284 --> 00:42:54,483
- Battles?
- Yes.

1183
00:42:55,523 --> 00:42:56,853
Maybe the armor didn't fit.

1184
00:42:57,753 --> 00:42:58,823
You couldn't fit into armor if you were fat.

1185
00:42:58,824 --> 00:43:00,563
I doubt they wanted to fight in battles.

1186
00:43:01,124 --> 00:43:04,763
I can't shed the feeling of it being a beauty standard.

1187
00:43:04,764 --> 00:43:05,902
- A beauty standard?
- Yes.

1188
00:43:05,903 --> 00:43:09,832
Think of the sculptures and statues from that time.

1189
00:43:09,833 --> 00:43:12,874
The men have great bodies with washboard abs.

1190
00:43:13,173 --> 00:43:16,344
That's how the men were portrayed.

1191
00:43:16,614 --> 00:43:18,043
Think of the Colosseum.

1192
00:43:18,173 --> 00:43:19,784
It has to be about armor.

1193
00:43:19,844 --> 00:43:22,183
Those who couldn't fit into armor had to fight in the Colosseum...

1194
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:23,614
without any armor on.

1195
00:43:23,983 --> 00:43:26,023
You could wear one though if it fit.

1196
00:43:26,684 --> 00:43:28,600
They were scared into thinking you couldn't wear one otherwise.

1197
00:43:28,624 --> 00:43:29,870
I know I'd lose weight if that were true.

1198
00:43:29,894 --> 00:43:31,994
They have to survive, right?

1199
00:43:32,394 --> 00:43:33,594
They would've lost the weight.

1200
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:34,922
Is that wrong?

1201
00:43:34,923 --> 00:43:36,093
(Well...)

1202
00:43:36,094 --> 00:43:37,993
Armor has to do with keeping your life.

1203
00:43:37,994 --> 00:43:39,534
Can't you just make them bigger?

1204
00:43:40,804 --> 00:43:42,973
They probably didn't make them in bigger sizes.

1205
00:43:42,974 --> 00:43:45,173
- Why not?
- Only in the average size.

1206
00:43:45,434 --> 00:43:47,573
I'm sure they had armor for the bigger guys.

1207
00:43:47,574 --> 00:43:49,373
Why wouldn't they make armor bigger?

1208
00:43:49,374 --> 00:43:51,543
- I'm clueless.
- Because the armor didn't fit.

1209
00:43:51,943 --> 00:43:53,482
Without the armor, you'd die.

1210
00:43:53,483 --> 00:43:54,684
With it, you'd live.

1211
00:43:54,943 --> 00:43:57,053
They lost the weight to fit into armor.

1212
00:43:57,054 --> 00:44:00,624
(They lost the weight to fit into armor.)

1213
00:44:00,923 --> 00:44:02,993
Don't you think I'm on the right track?

1214
00:44:02,994 --> 00:44:04,192
(Sang Uk is opinionated today unlike other days.)

1215
00:44:04,193 --> 00:44:07,963
(They're not feeling it.)

1216
00:44:08,164 --> 00:44:10,793
Sang Uk, have you ever gotten a question right?

1217
00:44:11,894 --> 00:44:12,933
I'm curious, that's all.

1218
00:44:12,934 --> 00:44:15,034
I'm trying to calculate the statistics.

1219
00:44:15,164 --> 00:44:16,303
- Have you ever been right?
- Well...

1220
00:44:16,304 --> 00:44:17,902
I came close once.

1221
00:44:17,903 --> 00:44:19,183
But you never once got it right.

1222
00:44:19,844 --> 00:44:22,143
- Tae Hyun, we'll go with your idea.
- You know...

1223
00:44:22,144 --> 00:44:23,513
Hear me out.

1224
00:44:23,514 --> 00:44:24,873
It has to be...

1225
00:44:24,874 --> 00:44:26,212
- a life or death situation.
- He...

1226
00:44:26,213 --> 00:44:28,082
- It can't be a beauty standard.
- You once said something off.

1227
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:29,482
- They had social classes.
- There's a reason...

1228
00:44:29,483 --> 00:44:32,283
I haven't been facing him.

1229
00:44:32,284 --> 00:44:33,352
I got fooled by him a couple of times.

1230
00:44:33,353 --> 00:44:34,422
Exactly.

1231
00:44:34,423 --> 00:44:35,623
- I got fooled.
- What did he say before?

1232
00:44:35,624 --> 00:44:37,993
He said many things, starting from a get-together.

1233
00:44:37,994 --> 00:44:40,763
But I do wish that Sang Uk...

1234
00:44:40,764 --> 00:44:44,263
will break out from this circle of wrong answers.

1235
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:45,433
- Tae Hyun.
- Yes?

1236
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:48,433
It can't be changed. Seriously.

1237
00:44:48,434 --> 00:44:51,204
Tae Hyun, it's hard for a person to change.

1238
00:44:51,633 --> 00:44:53,902
Sang Uk, if you get this wrong today,

1239
00:44:53,903 --> 00:44:55,373
will you be less insisting...

1240
00:44:55,374 --> 00:44:56,973
from now on?

1241
00:44:56,974 --> 00:44:58,272
Okay?

1242
00:44:58,273 --> 00:44:59,783
- I'll trust you with this one. Yes.
- Okay.

1243
00:44:59,784 --> 00:45:01,683
- Okay. Let's go with it.
- I'll trust you this time.

1244
00:45:01,684 --> 00:45:02,812
Okay. Here's our answer.

1245
00:45:02,813 --> 00:45:04,813
- What's the answer?
- The answer is...

1246
00:45:04,883 --> 00:45:06,083
Armor.

1247
00:45:07,124 --> 00:45:08,653
- Armor?
- To wear armor.

1248
00:45:09,353 --> 00:45:12,192
- The reason why men...
- Please, Sang Uk.

1249
00:45:12,193 --> 00:45:14,792
Were more into losing weight during the Renaissance.

1250
00:45:14,793 --> 00:45:16,493
About losing weight.

1251
00:45:16,494 --> 00:45:17,733
Armor.

1252
00:45:18,264 --> 00:45:19,744
You'll be a hero if you get it right.

1253
00:45:21,003 --> 00:45:22,973
(Please)

1254
00:45:22,974 --> 00:45:25,772
(Nervous)

1255
00:45:25,773 --> 00:45:26,942
(Armor)

1256
00:45:26,943 --> 00:45:28,003
- It's correct.
- Gosh!

1257
00:45:29,103 --> 00:45:30,213
- It's correct.
- Gosh!

1258
00:45:31,213 --> 00:45:33,883
- Finally, Sang Uk!
- I told you!

1259
00:45:33,943 --> 00:45:35,184
Armor!

1260
00:45:35,483 --> 00:45:38,053
- He did it. No wonder.
- No wonder.

1261
00:45:38,054 --> 00:45:39,623
He knew it...

1262
00:45:39,624 --> 00:45:41,152
- because he wears armor too.
- Exactly.

1263
00:45:41,153 --> 00:45:43,393
(He knew it because he wears armor too.)

1264
00:45:43,394 --> 00:45:45,353
Is he right about the gladiator too?

1265
00:45:45,494 --> 00:45:46,623
I'll tell you.

1266
00:45:46,624 --> 00:45:49,462
They had to wear armor when they went to war.

1267
00:45:49,463 --> 00:45:53,403
At that time, armor was the most expensive item men could have.

1268
00:45:53,503 --> 00:45:55,462
It was hard to make a new mending.

1269
00:45:55,463 --> 00:45:57,732
- They couldn't increase the size.
- They couldn't gain weight.

1270
00:45:57,733 --> 00:45:58,902
- It's a one-size only.
- They had to be in shape...

1271
00:45:58,903 --> 00:46:00,073
to survive.

1272
00:46:00,074 --> 00:46:01,573
- Gosh. I got it.
- That was the method.

1273
00:46:01,574 --> 00:46:03,973
(They're proud of him when they think about it again.)

1274
00:46:03,974 --> 00:46:05,442
I knew it, Sang Uk.

1275
00:46:05,443 --> 00:46:06,443
Finally, Sang Uk did it.

1276
00:46:06,444 --> 00:46:09,043
I'll trust you from now on. Sorry.

1277
00:46:10,813 --> 00:46:13,583
Nemonemo

1278
00:46:13,853 --> 00:46:16,624
(Namyangju: Workout)

1279
00:46:16,724 --> 00:46:18,352
- And the parts.
- I see.

1280
00:46:18,353 --> 00:46:21,163
- It's the song you wrote.
- That's right.

1281
00:46:21,164 --> 00:46:23,232
Can we first hear it?

1282
00:46:23,233 --> 00:46:24,293
- Okay.
- Yes.

1283
00:46:24,463 --> 00:46:30,502
(Handsome Guys, we are)

1284
00:46:30,503 --> 00:46:35,773
(Handsome Guys, we are)

1285
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,812
(Flustered)

1286
00:46:41,813 --> 00:46:44,414
This song is made just for you to sing.

1287
00:46:44,684 --> 00:46:46,522
How can we sing this?

1288
00:46:46,523 --> 00:46:48,323
It's very simple.

1289
00:46:48,324 --> 00:46:49,594
(Laughing)

1290
00:46:50,094 --> 00:46:51,522
(Is this even possible?)

1291
00:46:51,523 --> 00:46:53,623
- Can you play it once more?
- Okay. Once more.

1292
00:46:53,624 --> 00:46:55,724
- Do I have to sing that high?
- Yes. Hold on.

1293
00:46:56,833 --> 00:46:59,863
(The intro goes on calmly.)

1294
00:46:59,864 --> 00:47:01,534
- "We are?" - Yes. "We are."

1295
00:47:01,603 --> 00:47:02,903
(Singing)

1296
00:47:03,804 --> 00:47:06,203
(The notes suddenly become evil.)

1297
00:47:06,204 --> 00:47:07,402
It's the same.

1298
00:47:07,403 --> 00:47:09,143
Handsome Guys

1299
00:47:09,144 --> 00:47:10,212
We are

1300
00:47:10,213 --> 00:47:12,074
We'll start with Kyung Ho.

1301
00:47:12,543 --> 00:47:14,983
- You can do it.
- You can go into the booth first.

1302
00:47:15,414 --> 00:47:17,752
- You were focused just now.
- Why don't you protect your guest?

1303
00:47:17,753 --> 00:47:19,453
- You can try it now.
- You can do it.

1304
00:47:19,454 --> 00:47:21,353
- Let's hurry. We don't have time.
- Yes.

1305
00:47:21,523 --> 00:47:22,652
(Clearing his throat first)

1306
00:47:22,653 --> 00:47:24,423
You can sing it in your style.

1307
00:47:24,693 --> 00:47:27,163
(Greg teaches him the notes first.)

1308
00:47:27,164 --> 00:47:28,323
They're four notes.

1309
00:47:28,324 --> 00:47:29,732
(Sending soulfulness)

1310
00:47:29,733 --> 00:47:31,633
(Becoming soulful)

1311
00:47:32,034 --> 00:47:34,364
(Kyung Ho is absorbed in soul within just a few seconds.)

1312
00:47:35,563 --> 00:47:39,574
- Handsome Guys, we are - Okay.

1313
00:47:40,574 --> 00:47:42,573
- Not bad. You can do it.
- It was all right.

1314
00:47:42,574 --> 00:47:43,812
- You can do it.
- If you play the guide,

1315
00:47:43,813 --> 00:47:45,689
- I'll sing on top of it.
- Okay. Sing with it.

1316
00:47:45,713 --> 00:47:47,183
You can't do that. I sang without it.

1317
00:47:47,184 --> 00:47:48,882
- That was what you did.
- Hey.

1318
00:47:48,883 --> 00:47:50,013
(The guest is angry.)

1319
00:47:50,014 --> 00:47:51,954
He remembered it somehow. Let's hurry.

1320
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:58,224
(Handsome Guys, we are)

1321
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:59,594
(Hit the high notes now.)

1322
00:48:00,494 --> 00:48:03,563
(Exceeding his limit)

1323
00:48:04,164 --> 00:48:05,792
(Handsome Guys)

1324
00:48:05,793 --> 00:48:07,033
He's good.

1325
00:48:07,034 --> 00:48:08,833
It's hard to follow it.

1326
00:48:09,164 --> 00:48:11,003
(No, Handsome)

1327
00:48:11,074 --> 00:48:12,973
(Singing)

1328
00:48:12,974 --> 00:48:14,244
Only a few...

1329
00:48:14,943 --> 00:48:16,614
A few singers, including Naul,

1330
00:48:16,644 --> 00:48:18,373
have songs that we can't sing in karaoke.

1331
00:48:18,374 --> 00:48:19,514
So, Greg...

1332
00:48:20,244 --> 00:48:22,852
This song is imprinted with Greg all over it.

1333
00:48:22,853 --> 00:48:24,482
Seung Ho, try it. He has a good voice,

1334
00:48:24,483 --> 00:48:25,513
- Right.
- so it'll sound different.

1335
00:48:25,514 --> 00:48:27,674
- You have a great voice.
- Do you want me to play it?

1336
00:48:29,753 --> 00:48:33,494
(He sings the beginning part in a relaxed manner.)

1337
00:48:34,693 --> 00:48:37,093
(Handsome Guys)

1338
00:48:37,094 --> 00:48:38,133
(We are)

1339
00:48:40,804 --> 00:48:42,934
(Singing falsetto with his deep voice)

1340
00:48:44,673 --> 00:48:45,902
- What?
- Right?

1341
00:48:45,903 --> 00:48:47,002
- Yes.
- Gosh.

1342
00:48:47,003 --> 00:48:48,374
(Proud)

1343
00:48:48,874 --> 00:48:51,573
- You can do it.
- No.

1344
00:48:51,574 --> 00:48:52,942
What's going on?

1345
00:48:52,943 --> 00:48:55,513
Will the three of us be able to sing the jingle?

1346
00:48:55,514 --> 00:48:56,953
Yes, it's possible.

1347
00:48:56,954 --> 00:48:58,152
- Is it?
- Yes, of course.

1348
00:48:58,153 --> 00:49:00,752
- Why don't you record right away?
- Me? Okay.

1349
00:49:00,753 --> 00:49:03,393
I wouldn't be in it for long because I'm a guest.

1350
00:49:03,394 --> 00:49:04,394
That's not true.

1351
00:49:04,395 --> 00:49:06,263
Chest voice, mix,

1352
00:49:06,264 --> 00:49:07,664
- and falsetto.
- Goodness.

1353
00:49:07,894 --> 00:49:09,563
(A good example)

1354
00:49:09,594 --> 00:49:10,993
(Singing)

1355
00:49:10,994 --> 00:49:12,094
That's hard.

1356
00:49:12,133 --> 00:49:13,303
That's the hardest part.

1357
00:49:13,304 --> 00:49:14,434
- Seriously.
- It's good.

1358
00:49:14,864 --> 00:49:16,133
(Singing)

1359
00:49:16,633 --> 00:49:20,704
(Singing)

1360
00:49:21,204 --> 00:49:22,204
(Groaning)

1361
00:49:22,844 --> 00:49:24,414
(Taking a sip)

1362
00:49:25,043 --> 00:49:27,383
(Singing)

1363
00:49:28,213 --> 00:49:30,284
(He checks the pitch again.)

1364
00:49:30,454 --> 00:49:32,252
(A neat technique)

1365
00:49:32,253 --> 00:49:33,583
We are

1366
00:49:34,324 --> 00:49:35,453
(His soul is broken.)

1367
00:49:35,454 --> 00:49:36,824
Good. I love it, though.

1368
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:39,123
A ghost will appear.

1369
00:49:39,124 --> 00:49:40,193
(Groaning)

1370
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:41,623
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1371
00:49:41,624 --> 00:49:42,724
Good luck.

1372
00:49:43,264 --> 00:49:46,962
(He concentrates and calms his soul.)

1373
00:49:46,963 --> 00:49:49,204
(Learning the groove with his body)

1374
00:49:54,773 --> 00:50:00,114
(Handsome Guys, we are)

1375
00:50:00,213 --> 00:50:03,212
(Handsome Guys)

1376
00:50:03,213 --> 00:50:04,284
(We are)

1377
00:50:05,483 --> 00:50:07,852
(Handsome Guys)

1378
00:50:07,853 --> 00:50:09,054
Did you see a ghost?

1379
00:50:09,124 --> 00:50:10,853
(Dropping his head)

1380
00:50:12,653 --> 00:50:14,593
(They listen to the song together.)

1381
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,663
- I like that last part.
- It's just that he's not confident.

1382
00:50:16,664 --> 00:50:18,434
- You're right.
- It's all about confidence.

1383
00:50:21,304 --> 00:50:23,374
(Embarrassed)

1384
00:50:25,603 --> 00:50:27,074
A ghost must have strangled him.

1385
00:50:27,204 --> 00:50:30,672
For the "Handsome" part... Don't think about the improvisation.

1386
00:50:30,673 --> 00:50:33,543
- Just sing "Handsome Guys." - Okay.

1387
00:50:33,614 --> 00:50:35,344
(Second recording)

1388
00:50:36,184 --> 00:50:40,184
(Singing the beginning part stably)

1389
00:50:40,853 --> 00:50:43,623
(The problematic climax)

1390
00:50:43,624 --> 00:50:46,053
(We are)

1391
00:50:46,054 --> 00:50:48,923
(Finishing shyly)

1392
00:50:50,264 --> 00:50:51,563
Well.

1393
00:50:52,664 --> 00:50:54,133
Okay. Right.

1394
00:50:55,063 --> 00:50:57,474
I like the beginning part the most. The first part.

1395
00:50:58,034 --> 00:51:00,173
- The first part is really good.
- Is it?

1396
00:51:00,574 --> 00:51:02,043
- Okay.
- Thanks.

1397
00:51:02,244 --> 00:51:03,313
Thank you.

1398
00:51:04,074 --> 00:51:05,773
- It's hard.
- It's hard.

1399
00:51:06,074 --> 00:51:08,543
(Yi Kyung is the second one to record.)

1400
00:51:10,914 --> 00:51:12,983
He's recorded a song before.

1401
00:51:15,724 --> 00:51:17,954
(Missing the beat)

1402
00:51:21,224 --> 00:51:23,233
(It's all right.)

1403
00:51:24,133 --> 00:51:26,332
(Handsome Guys)

1404
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,533
(Shooting the high notes)

1405
00:51:28,534 --> 00:51:30,573
(Handsome Guys)

1406
00:51:30,574 --> 00:51:32,503
- He's relaxed.
- It ends so quickly.

1407
00:51:33,103 --> 00:51:34,443
(Satisfied)

1408
00:51:35,443 --> 00:51:36,874
- Adjust the timing.
- Okay.

1409
00:51:40,014 --> 00:51:43,083
(He focuses and listens to the high-pitch part.)

1410
00:51:43,813 --> 00:51:44,914
(Laughing)

1411
00:51:45,454 --> 00:51:47,983
(What do we do?)

1412
00:51:49,624 --> 00:51:51,723
(Laughing)

1413
00:51:51,724 --> 00:51:53,292
It's so humiliating.

1414
00:51:53,293 --> 00:51:54,922
We have to sit and listen to it.

1415
00:51:54,923 --> 00:51:57,034
(We are)

1416
00:51:57,094 --> 00:51:58,832
(What do we do now?)

1417
00:51:58,833 --> 00:52:00,062
Should I try it once before before getting out?

1418
00:52:00,063 --> 00:52:02,204
(His second recording)

1419
00:52:03,273 --> 00:52:07,772
(He records it again in a serious manner.)

1420
00:52:07,773 --> 00:52:10,812
(Handsome Guys)

1421
00:52:10,813 --> 00:52:11,844
(We are)

1422
00:52:13,313 --> 00:52:15,684
(Handsome Guys)

1423
00:52:16,284 --> 00:52:17,990
- It was more relaxed.
- It was relaxed. Yes.

1424
00:52:18,014 --> 00:52:19,212
(Yi Kyung gets the ending part.)

1425
00:52:19,213 --> 00:52:20,582
- They're all good.
- Okay.

1426
00:52:20,583 --> 00:52:21,753
Seung Ho.

1427
00:52:23,094 --> 00:52:24,453
I'll do my best.

1428
00:52:24,454 --> 00:52:25,553
(Cuckoo)

1429
00:52:25,554 --> 00:52:26,723
- What?
- Where did they get?

1430
00:52:26,724 --> 00:52:27,994
Namyangju!

1431
00:52:28,494 --> 00:52:29,693
Namyangju?

1432
00:52:30,364 --> 00:52:31,663
(Namyangju: Workout)

1433
00:52:31,664 --> 00:52:32,792
- That was why it took them so long.
- It's okay.

1434
00:52:32,793 --> 00:52:35,433
If we occupy this, Yangju is blocked, so it doesn't matter.

1435
00:52:35,434 --> 00:52:37,232
Let's move like we planned.

1436
00:52:37,233 --> 00:52:38,703
We won't go to Seongnam first.

1437
00:52:38,704 --> 00:52:41,102
We'll go further to Yongin.

1438
00:52:41,103 --> 00:52:43,143
Okay. Then we'll go here, depending on the situation.

1439
00:52:43,144 --> 00:52:44,744
- Yes.
- Then we'll make bingo.

1440
00:52:44,773 --> 00:52:45,973
- But first, - Yes.

1441
00:52:45,974 --> 00:52:47,334
- I want to see your soul.
- Okay.

1442
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,382
- Let's do it peacefully.
- Okay.

1443
00:52:49,383 --> 00:52:51,812
There's a little pressure because I have a big job to do.

1444
00:52:51,813 --> 00:52:54,784
Exactly. He heard the news right before he starts recording.

1445
00:52:55,554 --> 00:52:59,094
(Seung Ho will be responsible for the highest notes.)

1446
00:52:59,124 --> 00:53:01,192
- Seung Ho, actually, - He might make it.

1447
00:53:01,193 --> 00:53:02,292
Is a good singer.

1448
00:53:02,293 --> 00:53:04,063
He's going to make it work.

1449
00:53:04,894 --> 00:53:07,903
(Checking again for the last time)

1450
00:53:08,103 --> 00:53:10,503
- Is it in the right key?
- Yes, it is.

1451
00:53:13,744 --> 00:53:15,804
(Handsome Guys)

1452
00:53:15,943 --> 00:53:19,613
(He saves his energy during the beginning part.)

1453
00:53:19,614 --> 00:53:21,113
(Handsome)

1454
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:22,143
(Guys)

1455
00:53:22,144 --> 00:53:24,114
(We are)

1456
00:53:25,784 --> 00:53:27,224
- Good. That's good.
- Really?

1457
00:53:28,153 --> 00:53:29,954
Thanks to Seung Ho, it will work.

1458
00:53:30,454 --> 00:53:32,594
I'll sing it twice consecutively and go out.

1459
00:53:32,824 --> 00:53:34,022
He wants to come out,

1460
00:53:34,023 --> 00:53:36,664
- but he isn't satisfied.
- Right. I feel the same.

1461
00:53:36,934 --> 00:53:38,132
(Second recording)

1462
00:53:38,133 --> 00:53:39,963
- We'll start recording.
- Okay.

1463
00:53:40,063 --> 00:53:45,173
(Handsome Guys, we are)

1464
00:53:46,233 --> 00:53:48,503
(Handsome Guys)

1465
00:53:48,844 --> 00:53:51,374
(As expected, he hits the high notes without a problem.)

1466
00:53:51,744 --> 00:53:54,114
(Third recording)

1467
00:53:56,184 --> 00:53:59,053
(Seung Ho finishes recording energetically.)

1468
00:53:59,054 --> 00:54:00,224
Done!

1469
00:54:00,324 --> 00:54:02,083
(Greg is satisfied.)

1470
00:54:02,224 --> 00:54:03,823
Yes.

1471
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:05,793
(Good job, Seung Ho.)

1472
00:54:06,523 --> 00:54:09,793
(Though they were worried, they finished recording safely.)

1473
00:54:09,934 --> 00:54:11,962
(The mixing starts right away.)

1474
00:54:11,963 --> 00:54:13,163
Okay.

1475
00:54:13,164 --> 00:54:14,364
- Is it okay?
- Okay.

1476
00:54:14,434 --> 00:54:15,434
Good.

1477
00:54:15,435 --> 00:54:16,649
(They choose the part each sang the best.)

1478
00:54:16,673 --> 00:54:18,772
(Handsome Guys' jingle is finished in the blink of an eye.)

1479
00:54:18,773 --> 00:54:20,573
- Is it done?
- It's so easy.

1480
00:54:20,574 --> 00:54:22,373
- Can we hear it?
- You all did a great job.

1481
00:54:22,374 --> 00:54:24,272
- We didn't have to tune it much.
- Really?

1482
00:54:24,273 --> 00:54:25,974
- Let's hear it. Yes.
- Yes? Okay.

1483
00:54:26,414 --> 00:54:31,053
(Kyung Ho's beginning)

1484
00:54:31,054 --> 00:54:32,184
Is this me?

1485
00:54:33,224 --> 00:54:37,793
(Seung Ho's climax)

1486
00:54:38,253 --> 00:54:40,523
(Yi Kyung's finish)

1487
00:54:42,023 --> 00:54:43,023
What?

1488
00:54:43,563 --> 00:54:44,563
It worked like magic.

1489
00:54:45,894 --> 00:54:47,204
He improvised here and there.

1490
00:54:47,333 --> 00:54:48,333
Thank you.

1491
00:54:48,603 --> 00:54:49,603
Well done.

1492
00:54:49,604 --> 00:54:51,084
- Thank you.
- We have to play bingo.

1493
00:54:51,173 --> 00:54:52,173
- Let's meet afterward.
- Thank you.

1494
00:54:52,174 --> 00:54:53,473
(Hanam: Cover)

1495
00:54:53,474 --> 00:54:57,042
(Time for Quiz)

1496
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,882
- We somehow sang the jingle.
- Yes.

1497
00:54:59,883 --> 00:55:01,082
- Right.
- Let's take the quiz.

1498
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:02,913
I have to forget about it quickly.

1499
00:55:02,914 --> 00:55:04,383
Some of us saw ghosts.

1500
00:55:06,114 --> 00:55:09,023
(He is still possessed by the soulful ghost.)

1501
00:55:10,693 --> 00:55:12,252
- Here's the quiz.
- Yes. Go ahead.

1502
00:55:12,253 --> 00:55:13,263
Okay.

1503
00:55:13,264 --> 00:55:14,864
Greg is known for his RnB songs.

1504
00:55:16,423 --> 00:55:17,433
It's going to be about RnB.

1505
00:55:17,434 --> 00:55:19,902
When the popularity of RnB was at its peak,

1506
00:55:19,903 --> 00:55:22,764
its singing technique was called a cow-driving technique in Korea.

1507
00:55:24,074 --> 00:55:25,173
Now,

1508
00:55:25,474 --> 00:55:28,574
which meat of the following isn't part of a cow's rib?

1509
00:55:29,974 --> 00:55:31,014
Hold on.

1510
00:55:31,344 --> 00:55:33,312
- Luckily, it's a multiple-choice.
- Yes.

1511
00:55:33,313 --> 00:55:34,643
"Of the following" means it's a multiple-choice question.

1512
00:55:34,644 --> 00:55:35,644
- Listen.
- The question is really...

1513
00:55:35,645 --> 00:55:37,113
Greg led to RnB.

1514
00:55:37,114 --> 00:55:38,752
And it led to cow-driving technique, which led to the beef rib.

1515
00:55:38,753 --> 00:55:40,323
The ones who come up with it had some fun.

1516
00:55:40,324 --> 00:55:42,382
- Gosh. Non-cow's rib part.
- Okay. Let's calm down.

1517
00:55:42,383 --> 00:55:44,053
Okay. There must be four options.

1518
00:55:44,054 --> 00:55:45,300
- Please give them to us.
- Okay.

1519
00:55:45,324 --> 00:55:46,352
- Number one.
- Okay.

1520
00:55:46,353 --> 00:55:47,394
Thick skirt.

1521
00:55:47,824 --> 00:55:49,494
Number two, thin skirt.

1522
00:55:50,293 --> 00:55:52,193
Number three, thin flank.

1523
00:55:52,494 --> 00:55:53,934
Number four, neck chain.

1524
00:55:54,903 --> 00:55:57,203
Which of the four isn't part of the rib?

1525
00:55:57,204 --> 00:55:58,204
"The rib."

1526
00:55:58,773 --> 00:56:00,443
Thin skirt, thin flank...

1527
00:56:01,074 --> 00:56:02,074
Thick skirt.

1528
00:56:02,704 --> 00:56:04,304
As far as I know, as for the thin flank,

1529
00:56:04,474 --> 00:56:07,442
we can only get a small amount from the whole cow.

1530
00:56:07,443 --> 00:56:08,744
And is that around the rib?

1531
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,983
Well.

1532
00:56:11,713 --> 00:56:13,114
- I think...
- Before...

1533
00:56:13,383 --> 00:56:15,923
when it said "thin flank,"

1534
00:56:16,184 --> 00:56:18,123
we might think of the cow's side,

1535
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,853
so they choose it for us to get it wrong.

1536
00:56:20,324 --> 00:56:21,962
- Really?
- They thought we'd fall for it.

1537
00:56:21,963 --> 00:56:23,792
(Kyung Ho thinks thin flank is a trap.)

1538
00:56:23,793 --> 00:56:24,893
- It's really hard.
- Yes.

1539
00:56:24,894 --> 00:56:26,832
- We just have to pick one.
- I have no idea.

1540
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:28,703
Look. There must be a hint.

1541
00:56:28,704 --> 00:56:30,473
I don't see a hint up until the cow-driving part.

1542
00:56:30,474 --> 00:56:31,873
How can there be a hint there?

1543
00:56:31,874 --> 00:56:34,172
We just have to think about the cow rib.

1544
00:56:34,173 --> 00:56:35,243
It has nothing to do with it.

1545
00:56:35,244 --> 00:56:37,113
The cow's ribs are huge.

1546
00:56:37,114 --> 00:56:38,350
Imagine the ribs hanging in the air.

1547
00:56:38,374 --> 00:56:41,013
Of the meat around the rib, thick skirt is...

1548
00:56:41,014 --> 00:56:42,344
Hold on. Thick skirt.

1549
00:56:42,883 --> 00:56:43,953
- Thick skirt?
- Thick skirt?

1550
00:56:43,954 --> 00:56:45,513
- It sounds like a neck part.
- Yes.

1551
00:56:45,514 --> 00:56:46,852
- The neck part.
- The thick skirt.

1552
00:56:46,853 --> 00:56:48,373
Honestly, I think it's the thin skirt.

1553
00:56:48,554 --> 00:56:49,783
- The thin skirt?
- You think it's the thin skirt?

1554
00:56:49,784 --> 00:56:51,054
- It's not on the rib?
- No.

1555
00:56:51,824 --> 00:56:53,784
When you look at the cross section of the slices,

1556
00:56:53,923 --> 00:56:55,999
the thin skirt's cross section looks a little different.

1557
00:56:56,023 --> 00:56:57,764
The thin skirt is sliced into big pieces.

1558
00:56:58,463 --> 00:56:59,593
I like the thin skirt,

1559
00:56:59,594 --> 00:57:00,803
so that's all I have in a beef restaurant.

1560
00:57:00,804 --> 00:57:01,804
- Really?
- Yes.

1561
00:57:01,805 --> 00:57:03,263
- That means it's tasty.
- It's tasty.

1562
00:57:03,264 --> 00:57:04,373
If it's tasty, it's...

1563
00:57:04,374 --> 00:57:05,903
All the parts are tasty.

1564
00:57:06,133 --> 00:57:07,602
- The thick skirt is tasty too.
- It's tasty.

1565
00:57:07,603 --> 00:57:09,144
What does the thick skirt look like?

1566
00:57:10,574 --> 00:57:12,543
Hold on. We need to focus. It's...

1567
00:57:13,173 --> 00:57:15,743
I think it's either the neck chain or the thick skirt.

1568
00:57:15,744 --> 00:57:16,752
Really?

1569
00:57:16,753 --> 00:57:18,313
Where is the neck chain supposed to be?

1570
00:57:18,514 --> 00:57:20,253
Is it along the rib?

1571
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,953
The name of it doesn't represent where the meat is,

1572
00:57:22,954 --> 00:57:24,652
but it represents the shape of it.

1573
00:57:24,653 --> 00:57:26,022
- In my opinion, - The thin flank is...

1574
00:57:26,023 --> 00:57:27,123
the neck chain is part of the rib.

1575
00:57:27,124 --> 00:57:28,562
- Okay.
- I remember that.

1576
00:57:28,563 --> 00:57:29,624
- Okay.
- The neck chain.

1577
00:57:29,793 --> 00:57:31,663
Why am I suspicious of the thin skirt?

1578
00:57:31,664 --> 00:57:33,933
- Let's go with it, then.
- No.

1579
00:57:33,934 --> 00:57:35,402
- What will we do, then?
- We can't get it wrong like this.

1580
00:57:35,403 --> 00:57:36,502
Let's do rock-paper-scissors.

1581
00:57:36,503 --> 00:57:37,533
If you win, it's the thin skirt.

1582
00:57:37,534 --> 00:57:38,573
If one of us wins, it's the thick skirt.

1583
00:57:38,574 --> 00:57:40,402
We're depending too much on fate, then.

1584
00:57:40,403 --> 00:57:41,843
We'll go for it because we'll use the reattempt card.

1585
00:57:41,844 --> 00:57:42,873
We'll use the card anyway.

1586
00:57:42,874 --> 00:57:44,144
Rock-paper-scissors.

1587
00:57:44,474 --> 00:57:45,843
Hold on. I don't think it's the thin skirt.

1588
00:57:45,844 --> 00:57:46,943
Gosh.

1589
00:57:47,744 --> 00:57:48,883
What's going on?

1590
00:57:49,583 --> 00:57:51,652
Okay. Let's assume that we'll use the reattempt card.

1591
00:57:51,653 --> 00:57:53,053
- Yes.
- You can choose.

1592
00:57:53,054 --> 00:57:54,522
Okay. Let's go with the thin skirt.

1593
00:57:54,523 --> 00:57:55,724
We can use the reattempt card.

1594
00:57:56,124 --> 00:57:57,224
We'll go for it.

1595
00:57:58,554 --> 00:58:01,022
Which part is not around the rib?

1596
00:58:01,023 --> 00:58:02,303
I'll just do it. The thin skirt.

1597
00:58:03,094 --> 00:58:04,394
Number two, thin skirt.

1598
00:58:04,764 --> 00:58:05,764
Yes.

1599
00:58:05,765 --> 00:58:07,132
(Which meat isn't part of the cow's rib? Thin skirt)

1600
00:58:07,133 --> 00:58:08,232
It's wrong.

1601
00:58:08,233 --> 00:58:09,833
Let's use the reattempt card right away.

1602
00:58:10,474 --> 00:58:11,772
(Sad)

1603
00:58:11,773 --> 00:58:12,773
(The reattempt card)

1604
00:58:12,774 --> 00:58:14,074
- Then...
- Here's a hint.

1605
00:58:14,543 --> 00:58:15,873
- Is there a hint?
- I'll give you one.

1606
00:58:15,874 --> 00:58:17,474
- You're giving us a hint. Right.
- Yes.

1607
00:58:18,173 --> 00:58:19,213
Kim Won Jun.

1608
00:58:19,543 --> 00:58:20,543
Pardon?

1609
00:58:20,684 --> 00:58:22,383
- Kim Won Jun?
- Kim Won Jun.

1610
00:58:22,713 --> 00:58:24,213
(When everyone's asleep)

1611
00:58:24,554 --> 00:58:25,613
- Singer Kim Won Jun.
- Show

1612
00:58:25,614 --> 00:58:27,684
(It never ends)

1613
00:58:27,983 --> 00:58:30,143
- He doesn't know. He's too young.
- I don't know him.

1614
00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:32,594
Didn't he wear a skirt in the beginning?

1615
00:58:33,523 --> 00:58:34,562
- You're right.
- Right?

1616
00:58:34,563 --> 00:58:36,163
Yes. He wore it like this.

1617
00:58:36,164 --> 00:58:37,393
- Something like this.
- Listen.

1618
00:58:37,394 --> 00:58:38,732
- It's...
- Yes. Kim Won Jun and a skirt.

1619
00:58:38,733 --> 00:58:39,962
The answer could be the neck chain,

1620
00:58:39,963 --> 00:58:41,502
but he didn't wear chains around his neck.

1621
00:58:41,503 --> 00:58:43,332
- You're right.
- That makes the staff look weird.

1622
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:44,403
It wasn't a thick skirt.

1623
00:58:45,003 --> 00:58:46,373
Then it's a thin flank.

1624
00:58:46,374 --> 00:58:47,703
- Yes. Think flank.
- Because of you...

1625
00:58:47,704 --> 00:58:48,873
- Sorry.
- Kyung Ho.

1626
00:58:48,874 --> 00:58:49,874
- Okay.
- Kyung Ho.

1627
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:50,913
- Is it the thin flank?
- It is.

1628
00:58:50,914 --> 00:58:51,973
- It is.
- I don't know him.

1629
00:58:51,974 --> 00:58:53,113
- It's right.
- So, I want to check.

1630
00:58:53,114 --> 00:58:54,212
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

1631
00:58:54,213 --> 00:58:55,293
- Thin flank.
- Thin flank.

1632
00:58:55,644 --> 00:58:57,083
Thin flank. Correct.

1633
00:58:58,014 --> 00:58:59,352
Sorry. It's done.

1634
00:58:59,353 --> 00:59:00,652
- We've occupied this spot anyway.
- It's good.

1635
00:59:00,653 --> 00:59:02,022
It's all good.

1636
00:59:02,023 --> 00:59:04,192
- Kyung Ho, you said...
- Come on.

1637
00:59:04,193 --> 00:59:05,224
I'm sorry about that.

1638
00:59:05,523 --> 00:59:06,823
Okay. We got the covering with Greg.

1639
00:59:06,824 --> 00:59:08,193
(Checking the food on the card)

1640
00:59:08,824 --> 00:59:09,863
Short rib.

1641
00:59:09,864 --> 00:59:11,062
Eating short ribs after chicken.

1642
00:59:11,063 --> 00:59:12,663
- Isn't that too much?
- Gosh. What do we do?

1643
00:59:12,664 --> 00:59:13,963
Okay. Let's promise.

1644
00:59:14,304 --> 00:59:15,732
We'll leave in 25 minutes.

1645
00:59:15,733 --> 00:59:16,733
- We have to eat quickly.
- These short ribs.

1646
00:59:16,734 --> 00:59:18,203
- Can we take them to go?
- We can eat near here...

1647
00:59:18,204 --> 00:59:19,874
while the car is parked here, right?

1648
00:59:20,403 --> 00:59:22,102
- Hanam.
- Hanam.

1649
00:59:22,103 --> 00:59:27,743
(Hanam: Cover)

1650
00:59:27,744 --> 00:59:29,813
- We'll buy a cake first.
- Okay.

1651
00:59:29,983 --> 00:59:31,083
I'll go and buy one.

1652
00:59:31,454 --> 00:59:33,252
(Amazed)

1653
00:59:33,253 --> 00:59:34,423
The cakes look good.

1654
00:59:34,983 --> 00:59:37,724
Could I get the chocolate gateau?

1655
00:59:40,023 --> 00:59:41,224
Gosh. This is so...

1656
00:59:41,293 --> 00:59:42,724
(Grabbing)

1657
00:59:45,293 --> 00:59:47,304
- A cream bun.
- Why did you grab it?

1658
00:59:47,403 --> 00:59:48,803
I want to eat it.

1659
00:59:48,804 --> 00:59:50,003
- No.
- No?

1660
00:59:51,233 --> 00:59:52,573
- Is there a rule about it?
- There is.

1661
00:59:52,574 --> 00:59:53,744
Do we have a rule on that?

1662
00:59:54,273 --> 00:59:55,442
Did we?

1663
00:59:55,443 --> 00:59:57,772
(The cream bun goes back to where it was.)

1664
00:59:57,773 --> 00:59:59,172
Did we have such a rule?

1665
00:59:59,173 --> 01:00:00,283
(He can't believe it.)

1666
01:00:00,284 --> 01:00:02,812
(He comes back only with the cake.)

1667
01:00:02,813 --> 01:00:03,813
- Okay.
- Yes.

1668
01:00:04,054 --> 01:00:05,483
Tae Hyun, did we...

1669
01:00:06,284 --> 01:00:09,083
have a rule that we can't buy other food such as a bun?

1670
01:00:09,483 --> 01:00:10,752
- Yes.
- Really?

1671
01:00:10,753 --> 01:00:12,192
They said it was okay only if others buy it for us.

1672
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:14,062
- That's right.
- We can't buy food.

1673
01:00:14,063 --> 01:00:15,193
I was buying a cream bun...

1674
01:00:15,563 --> 01:00:18,093
We're going to have kalguksu anyway.

1675
01:00:18,094 --> 01:00:19,374
But they said I couldn't buy it.

1676
01:00:20,094 --> 01:00:21,402
You drive me nuts.

1677
01:00:21,403 --> 01:00:22,562
(Sad)

1678
01:00:22,563 --> 01:00:23,704
I was buying it.

1679
01:00:24,374 --> 01:00:25,433
(Cuckoo)

1680
01:00:25,434 --> 01:00:26,434
I knew it.

1681
01:00:26,804 --> 01:00:27,843
Hanam.

1682
01:00:27,844 --> 01:00:28,973
- Hanam.
- Hanam.

1683
01:00:28,974 --> 01:00:30,312
- Where is it?
- Let me check.

1684
01:00:30,313 --> 01:00:31,443
They went to Hanam.

1685
01:00:31,614 --> 01:00:33,244
Where will they go now?

1686
01:00:33,684 --> 01:00:35,683
Why did it take a long time when they were singing?

1687
01:00:35,684 --> 01:00:37,113
(Hanam: Cover, Namyangju: Workout)

1688
01:00:37,114 --> 01:00:38,453
(Handmade kalguksu)

1689
01:00:38,454 --> 01:00:40,053
It looks good.

1690
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:41,422
(Workout: Kalguksu)

1691
01:00:41,423 --> 01:00:42,483
I'm hungry.

1692
01:00:42,724 --> 01:00:43,824
Three kalguksu.

1693
01:00:44,224 --> 01:00:45,252
Dong Hyun.

1694
01:00:45,253 --> 01:00:46,893
- Do you want me to order for you?
- What?

1695
01:00:46,894 --> 01:00:48,394
Something like dumplings.

1696
01:00:49,124 --> 01:00:50,663
- Here he goes again.
- We should get dumplings.

1697
01:00:50,664 --> 01:00:51,664
Sure.

1698
01:00:52,164 --> 01:00:53,463
Steamed dumplings.

1699
01:00:55,264 --> 01:00:56,603
We'll go to Yongin and...

1700
01:00:56,974 --> 01:00:58,603
Actually, in Yongin,

1701
01:00:59,503 --> 01:01:01,644
if we get it right without using the reattempt card,

1702
01:01:01,903 --> 01:01:03,203
- then we can put them to sleep...
- Then...

1703
01:01:03,204 --> 01:01:05,073
- and get going.
- That's the best scenario.

1704
01:01:05,074 --> 01:01:06,374
We're going to Yongin.

1705
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:09,014
But let's say they are going to Yongin too.

1706
01:01:09,114 --> 01:01:10,513
- To Yongin?
- Yes.

1707
01:01:10,514 --> 01:01:13,014
Yongin is an option for them because they occupied Hanam.

1708
01:01:13,114 --> 01:01:16,253
If they're going to the same place we're going,

1709
01:01:16,724 --> 01:01:20,022
they'll reach it faster because of the distance.

1710
01:01:20,023 --> 01:01:21,593
(The other team is closer to Yongin.)

1711
01:01:21,594 --> 01:01:22,764
- You're right.
- Yes.

1712
01:01:22,824 --> 01:01:25,562
If we want to go to Yongin, the option we have is...

1713
01:01:25,563 --> 01:01:26,933
(If we want to go to Yongin...)

1714
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:28,374
to put them to sleep after the meal.

1715
01:01:28,403 --> 01:01:29,733
That's the only option.

1716
01:01:30,574 --> 01:01:32,533
- We have no choice but to...
- This week?

1717
01:01:32,534 --> 01:01:33,744
Tae Hyun, it's crazy.

1718
01:01:34,043 --> 01:01:35,043
What?

1719
01:01:35,044 --> 01:01:36,744
The owner's son's birthday is this week.

1720
01:01:36,903 --> 01:01:39,074
- Really?
- Hold on.

1721
01:01:39,273 --> 01:01:40,482
- It's on the 28th.
- It's the 28th, right?

1722
01:01:40,483 --> 01:01:41,613
Where is your son?

1723
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:42,783
Okay.

1724
01:01:42,784 --> 01:01:44,252
I was on my way back from the restroom,

1725
01:01:44,253 --> 01:01:46,183
and he said hello to me.

1726
01:01:46,184 --> 01:01:47,683
I said, "Are you the owner? Is it your birthday by any chance?"

1727
01:01:47,684 --> 01:01:48,823
- Okay.
- And he said,

1728
01:01:48,824 --> 01:01:50,522
- "It's my son's birthday." - Hold on, Dong Hyun.

1729
01:01:50,523 --> 01:01:52,152
- Isn't the 28th Monday?
- Monday?

1730
01:01:52,153 --> 01:01:53,323
- No?
- The 28th wouldn't do?

1731
01:01:53,324 --> 01:01:54,823
If it's the 28th, it's next Tuesday.

1732
01:01:54,824 --> 01:01:56,292
(The acceptable birthday week)

1733
01:01:56,293 --> 01:01:57,332
That was close.

1734
01:01:57,333 --> 01:01:58,562
(We were happy for no reason.)

1735
01:01:58,563 --> 01:01:59,763
Sorry. Yes.

1736
01:01:59,764 --> 01:02:01,264
- Thank you anyway.
- Thank you.

1737
01:02:02,133 --> 01:02:03,304
It is the 28th.

1738
01:02:03,633 --> 01:02:05,273
- Gosh. That was close.
- That was close.

1739
01:02:05,633 --> 01:02:07,443
- We almost got it.
- Yes.

1740
01:02:08,204 --> 01:02:10,043
Yes. Tae Hyun, we have to...

1741
01:02:10,713 --> 01:02:11,744
It looks good.

1742
01:02:12,574 --> 01:02:14,294
Gosh. They are handmade dumplings. Awesome.

1743
01:02:14,583 --> 01:02:16,283
These are the ones we eat on holidays.

1744
01:02:16,284 --> 01:02:18,153
(Looking tasty)

1745
01:02:19,114 --> 01:02:20,422
- Thanks for the food.
- Enjoy.

1746
01:02:20,423 --> 01:02:21,953
- Enjoy.
- Please enjoy.

1747
01:02:21,954 --> 01:02:23,894
They have to be delicious.

1748
01:02:24,793 --> 01:02:25,852
Steamed dumplings.

1749
01:02:25,853 --> 01:02:27,823
- Are they not enough?
- That's not it.

1750
01:02:27,824 --> 01:02:28,994
(That can't be true.)

1751
01:02:29,264 --> 01:02:30,463
We have enough.

1752
01:02:32,494 --> 01:02:33,562
(The frown of the truth)

1753
01:02:33,563 --> 01:02:34,704
"Are they not enough?"

1754
01:02:35,164 --> 01:02:36,564
These kimchi dumplings are so good.

1755
01:02:37,633 --> 01:02:39,233
(Savoring)

1756
01:02:39,903 --> 01:02:43,273
(Sang Uk takes a bite too.)

1757
01:02:43,874 --> 01:02:45,014
- Gosh.
- Good.

1758
01:02:47,213 --> 01:02:50,313
(Kalguksu is here too.)

1759
01:02:51,014 --> 01:02:52,614
There is so much chicken in it.

1760
01:02:52,784 --> 01:02:53,784
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1761
01:02:53,784 --> 01:02:54,784
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1762
01:02:54,785 --> 01:02:56,522
(Carbs and protein)

1763
01:02:56,523 --> 01:02:58,494
(A good menu choice after the workout)

1764
01:02:59,894 --> 01:03:01,364
(Blowing)

1765
01:03:01,824 --> 01:03:02,893
It's so good.

1766
01:03:02,894 --> 01:03:04,833
(Slurping)

1767
01:03:05,693 --> 01:03:09,402
(Sang Uk ordered kaljebi, kalguksu with sujebi)

1768
01:03:09,403 --> 01:03:10,632
(He takes some out so it won't be too hot.)

1769
01:03:10,633 --> 01:03:11,913
These dumplings are really good.

1770
01:03:12,934 --> 01:03:14,043
Have some more.

1771
01:03:14,903 --> 01:03:17,313
(He puts kimchi on it.)

1772
01:03:21,344 --> 01:03:23,113
(Kalguksu keeps going in.)

1773
01:03:23,114 --> 01:03:24,153
It's really good.

1774
01:03:24,353 --> 01:03:25,414
(Savoring)

1775
01:03:25,853 --> 01:03:27,853
But that guy...

1776
01:03:28,023 --> 01:03:29,783
The entertainers like Kim Jong Min are unpredictable.

1777
01:03:29,784 --> 01:03:33,624
(He must have been hungry.)

1778
01:03:34,224 --> 01:03:35,523
It's really good.

1779
01:03:38,264 --> 01:03:39,562
These dumplings are amazing.

1780
01:03:39,563 --> 01:03:41,203
(Dong Hyun has dumplings first.)

1781
01:03:41,204 --> 01:03:43,233
Gosh. Seriously.

1782
01:03:46,633 --> 01:03:49,543
(He's crazy about the dumplings.)

1783
01:03:49,804 --> 01:03:51,943
- Tae Hyun, have one more dumpling.
- No.

1784
01:03:52,173 --> 01:03:53,543
- No?
- You can have it.

1785
01:03:53,644 --> 01:03:54,644
Thank you.

1786
01:03:54,645 --> 01:03:55,712
(Without hesitation)

1787
01:03:55,713 --> 01:03:56,744
(Laughing)

1788
01:03:57,253 --> 01:03:58,983
(It's all mine if you won't have it.)

1789
01:03:59,514 --> 01:04:00,883
The soup is disappearing.

1790
01:04:01,483 --> 01:04:02,723
The noodles have absorbed the broth.

1791
01:04:02,724 --> 01:04:03,894
(He finished the dumplings.)

1792
01:04:04,293 --> 01:04:05,652
- Do you calculate such a thing too?
- Yes.

1793
01:04:05,653 --> 01:04:08,264
If I don't hurry, noodles will absorb all the broth.

1794
01:04:09,264 --> 01:04:10,732
I can't be beaten by the noodles.

1795
01:04:10,733 --> 01:04:12,832
(I can't be beaten by the noodles.)

1796
01:04:12,833 --> 01:04:14,602
The noodles are drinking my broth.

1797
01:04:14,603 --> 01:04:15,632
(He's funny.)

1798
01:04:15,633 --> 01:04:19,034
(Every moment is a match for him.)

1799
01:04:19,434 --> 01:04:21,543
We should check the street casting before we leave.

1800
01:04:23,244 --> 01:04:25,014
What? Cast U?

1801
01:04:25,644 --> 01:04:28,244
Don't they interview people on the streets?

1802
01:04:29,313 --> 01:04:30,513
I know what it is.

1803
01:04:30,514 --> 01:04:33,453
That means it'll take less time than the last one.

1804
01:04:33,454 --> 01:04:34,774
We just need to interview people.

1805
01:04:34,853 --> 01:04:35,922
It'll be very nice.

1806
01:04:35,923 --> 01:04:36,983
Don't keep it long.

1807
01:04:37,353 --> 01:04:39,292
Tae Hyun, I didn't say anything earlier.

1808
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:41,164
You were the one who wanted to go on.

1809
01:04:41,594 --> 01:04:43,223
- You wanted 3 more tries.
- You wanted 3 more tries.

1810
01:04:43,224 --> 01:04:44,562
"I'll memorize it after three more tries."

1811
01:04:44,563 --> 01:04:46,663
You kept memorizing it in your head.

1812
01:04:46,664 --> 01:04:47,804
- You're right.
- Yes.

1813
01:04:49,833 --> 01:04:51,533
Shall we set off to Yongin?

1814
01:04:51,534 --> 01:04:52,603
Let's go to Yongin.

1815
01:04:53,003 --> 01:04:54,343
We'll go to Yongin.

1816
01:04:54,344 --> 01:04:55,772
- Okay. Let's take that square.
- Yongin.

1817
01:04:55,773 --> 01:04:57,002
(They set off to Yongin.)

1818
01:04:57,003 --> 01:04:58,074
Let's go.

1819
01:04:58,543 --> 01:04:59,772
- All right.
- Okay.

1820
01:04:59,773 --> 01:05:00,914
That wasn't the problem.

1821
01:05:01,644 --> 01:05:03,542
(His voice is hoarse.)

1822
01:05:03,543 --> 01:05:04,943
That was when my voice went hoarse.

1823
01:05:05,114 --> 01:05:07,352
Since you came...

1824
01:05:07,353 --> 01:05:08,853
(Singing)

1825
01:05:09,383 --> 01:05:11,894
(Laughing)

1826
01:05:12,153 --> 01:05:14,192
(Kyung Ho's soul makes them laugh.)

1827
01:05:14,193 --> 01:05:15,763
Please sing the intro.

1828
01:05:15,764 --> 01:05:16,863
(Singing)

1829
01:05:16,864 --> 01:05:20,664
(They should begin the Obsessive High Note Clinic.)

1830
01:05:21,364 --> 01:05:22,833
(Chuckling)

1831
01:05:26,133 --> 01:05:28,243
(He's the center of the Obsessive High Note Clinic.)

1832
01:05:28,244 --> 01:05:29,244
It's nice.

1833
01:05:29,245 --> 01:05:30,844
The melody is quite addictive.

1834
01:05:31,414 --> 01:05:32,574
(Singing)

1835
01:05:34,414 --> 01:05:37,353
(Laughing)

1836
01:05:38,813 --> 01:05:40,752
When we began, it was like this.

1837
01:05:40,753 --> 01:05:43,152
Chest voice...

1838
01:05:43,153 --> 01:05:45,793
- Mixed, falsetto.
- Mixed, falsetto.

1839
01:05:46,324 --> 01:05:48,764
(The ace member gives a demonstration.)

1840
01:05:49,293 --> 01:05:50,563
That was...

1841
01:05:50,994 --> 01:05:53,232
(Singing)

1842
01:05:53,233 --> 01:05:54,503
There were six levels.

1843
01:05:54,534 --> 01:05:56,563
It was like "Mr. Du Kke" in "Run Ha Ni."

1844
01:05:57,034 --> 01:05:58,733
- "Run Ha Ni." - "Mr. Du Kke."

1845
01:05:59,603 --> 01:06:00,644
"Ha Ni."

1846
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:02,943
Mr. Hong Du Kke.

1847
01:06:03,204 --> 01:06:04,672
We get spicy crabs as well.

1848
01:06:04,673 --> 01:06:05,953
(The dish they ordered arrives.)

1849
01:06:06,114 --> 01:06:08,183
I'll cut the meat into big pieces.

1850
01:06:08,184 --> 01:06:09,184
(Glossy beef ribs appear.)

1851
01:06:09,185 --> 01:06:10,283
I'll enjoy the food.

1852
01:06:10,284 --> 01:06:12,514
(They go on the grill.)

1853
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:15,752
It makes a nice picture.

1854
01:06:15,753 --> 01:06:16,954
Show us what you can do.

1855
01:06:17,153 --> 01:06:20,454
I'm someone who eats a lot on other shows.

1856
01:06:20,523 --> 01:06:23,224
But I'm an ordinary man before Seung Ho and Sang Uk.

1857
01:06:23,864 --> 01:06:25,304
If you eat meat without reservation,

1858
01:06:25,434 --> 01:06:27,403
how much can you eat?

1859
01:06:27,563 --> 01:06:30,232
My manager and I have eaten...

1860
01:06:30,233 --> 01:06:31,833
about 2.5kg of shaved pork belly.

1861
01:06:32,003 --> 01:06:34,102
That means you ate over four geun.

1862
01:06:34,103 --> 01:06:35,173
I think so.

1863
01:06:35,773 --> 01:06:38,244
It was the day I filmed an action scene.

1864
01:06:38,974 --> 01:06:40,244
It was so exhausting.

1865
01:06:40,813 --> 01:06:43,143
(He cuts the bones and puts them in one spot.)

1866
01:06:43,284 --> 01:06:45,213
- He's very good.
- He knows what to do...

1867
01:06:45,214 --> 01:06:46,384
at a certain time.

1868
01:06:48,523 --> 01:06:51,093
If the doneness suits you, you can eat the meat now.

1869
01:06:51,254 --> 01:06:52,523
- Already?
- Yes.

1870
01:06:53,124 --> 01:06:54,124
Let's hurry up and eat.

1871
01:06:54,464 --> 01:06:56,323
- Enjoy the food.
- Enjoy the food.

1872
01:06:56,324 --> 01:06:57,533
Go ahead. It looks delicious.

1873
01:06:57,534 --> 01:06:59,363
- Seriously.
- Ribs are tastier...

1874
01:06:59,364 --> 01:07:01,704
if you cook it them a bit more than sirloin.

1875
01:07:03,263 --> 01:07:04,732
- It's tasty now.
- It's for the taste.

1876
01:07:04,733 --> 01:07:05,733
Yes.

1877
01:07:05,903 --> 01:07:08,674
(Yi Kyung eats a piece as well.)

1878
01:07:10,143 --> 01:07:12,013
(It's just right.)

1879
01:07:12,714 --> 01:07:13,873
(Dr. Han Yu Rim eats a piece as well.)

1880
01:07:13,874 --> 01:07:15,683
- Eat up.
- Okay.

1881
01:07:16,483 --> 01:07:17,483
It's tasty.

1882
01:07:19,584 --> 01:07:20,723
(He dips it in salt.)

1883
01:07:25,193 --> 01:07:27,794
(The onion and short rib go into his mouth.)

1884
01:07:29,464 --> 01:07:30,593
(Sweating)

1885
01:07:30,834 --> 01:07:32,493
You're sweating from grilling meat.

1886
01:07:32,494 --> 01:07:34,334
- We're eating without a problem.
- Yes.

1887
01:07:35,004 --> 01:07:36,534
Naengmyeon is here.

1888
01:07:37,534 --> 01:07:39,232
- Thank you.
- Eat up.

1889
01:07:39,233 --> 01:07:42,303
(Cold naengmyeon goes well with short rib.)

1890
01:07:44,714 --> 01:07:46,174
I wasn't going to eat so much.

1891
01:07:47,784 --> 01:07:48,842
(Inhaling the food)

1892
01:07:48,843 --> 01:07:50,584
People who grill meat well are popular.

1893
01:07:52,084 --> 01:07:53,414
(Slurping)

1894
01:07:55,353 --> 01:07:58,424
- Let's leave at 40 minutes.
- Okay.

1895
01:07:58,954 --> 01:08:01,493
Seung Ho becomes energetic...

1896
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:04,233
after eating meat. It's nice to see.

1897
01:08:04,693 --> 01:08:06,063
So he's a carnivore.

1898
01:08:06,334 --> 01:08:07,903
He loves meat so much.

1899
01:08:08,763 --> 01:08:10,802
(Eating)

1900
01:08:10,803 --> 01:08:12,704
(Eating some more)

1901
01:08:16,674 --> 01:08:19,214
(He replenished his energy.)

1902
01:08:19,813 --> 01:08:20,813
He eats with gusto.

1903
01:08:21,544 --> 01:08:23,143
(Satisfied)

1904
01:08:23,284 --> 01:08:24,652
It looks like...

1905
01:08:24,653 --> 01:08:26,883
we're the father, uncle, and son.

1906
01:08:26,884 --> 01:08:28,052
(A beef party with the family)

1907
01:08:28,053 --> 01:08:29,083
It looks like we're on a trip.

1908
01:08:29,084 --> 01:08:30,183
Eat up, my son.

1909
01:08:30,893 --> 01:08:32,413
- Thank you for the food, Dad.
- Okay.

1910
01:08:33,553 --> 01:08:35,963
Seeing you eat...

1911
01:08:35,964 --> 01:08:37,223
makes me hum.

1912
01:08:37,534 --> 01:08:38,733
(Singing)

1913
01:08:39,334 --> 01:08:41,204
(Laughing)

1914
01:08:42,233 --> 01:08:43,504
(Singing)

1915
01:08:43,704 --> 01:08:45,573
(His vocal cords improved after eating meat.)

1916
01:08:45,574 --> 01:08:47,249
Don't you think we'll do well if we try again?

1917
01:08:47,273 --> 01:08:48,342
We should've done it with more confidence.

1918
01:08:48,343 --> 01:08:49,573
(He became the expert on sentimental singing.)

1919
01:08:49,574 --> 01:08:50,674
We should've done that.

1920
01:08:52,843 --> 01:08:54,243
Let's wrap up...

1921
01:08:54,244 --> 01:08:55,982
- and go to Yongin.
- Let's go.

1922
01:08:55,983 --> 01:08:56,983
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1923
01:08:56,984 --> 01:08:58,183
(Thank you for the food.)

1924
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:02,522
(Humming)

1925
01:09:02,523 --> 01:09:04,353
I wonder how many times we'll sing...

1926
01:09:04,693 --> 01:09:07,093
on our way to Yongin.

1927
01:09:08,023 --> 01:09:09,124
We should stop.

1928
01:09:10,624 --> 01:09:12,563
I don't think we'll be able to stop.

1929
01:09:15,233 --> 01:09:17,602
I wonder where the other team is going.

1930
01:09:17,603 --> 01:09:19,272
We have the identification card.

1931
01:09:19,273 --> 01:09:20,303
Yes.

1932
01:09:20,374 --> 01:09:21,503
I think we should see...

1933
01:09:21,504 --> 01:09:24,643
if they're going up or down.

1934
01:09:24,874 --> 01:09:27,512
Then it'll be easier to decide where to go next.

1935
01:09:27,513 --> 01:09:29,883
I think we should check after we leave Yongin.

1936
01:09:29,884 --> 01:09:30,914
Shall we do that?

1937
01:09:31,013 --> 01:09:32,013
Let's do that.

1938
01:09:32,414 --> 01:09:35,823
(Team Guys left earlier.)

1939
01:09:35,824 --> 01:09:40,124
(Team Handsome left from a closer location.)

1940
01:09:40,523 --> 01:09:44,334
(Which team will arrive at Yongin first?)

1941
01:09:45,364 --> 01:09:48,233
(Team Guys left for Yongin first.)

1942
01:09:48,603 --> 01:09:50,902
For street casting,

1943
01:09:50,903 --> 01:09:52,834
my hair should be pretty. What's this?

1944
01:09:54,803 --> 01:09:55,973
We sweated too.

1945
01:09:56,074 --> 01:09:57,812
What's this? My hair is a mess.

1946
01:09:57,813 --> 01:09:58,913
(Shabby)

1947
01:09:58,914 --> 01:10:00,942
(Touching)

1948
01:10:00,943 --> 01:10:02,013
Street casting.

1949
01:10:02,884 --> 01:10:06,114
(Focused)

1950
01:10:06,454 --> 01:10:07,982
For street casting,

1951
01:10:07,983 --> 01:10:09,624
I should look funny at the very least.

1952
01:10:11,723 --> 01:10:13,152
(Glancing over)

1953
01:10:13,153 --> 01:10:15,493
(Laughing)

1954
01:10:15,494 --> 01:10:16,723
(He's funny.)

1955
01:10:18,964 --> 01:10:20,063
It's so nice.

1956
01:10:21,534 --> 01:10:23,602
For street casting,

1957
01:10:23,603 --> 01:10:25,203
I changed my hairstyle to that of a trot singer.

1958
01:10:25,204 --> 01:10:26,232
(A trot singer's hairstyle)

1959
01:10:26,233 --> 01:10:27,704
(He loves it.)

1960
01:10:29,044 --> 01:10:31,642
It's nice to change my hairstyle!

1961
01:10:31,643 --> 01:10:33,850
(With the new hairstyle, they move to the next location!)

1962
01:10:33,874 --> 01:10:35,543
We can't predict the question.

1963
01:10:35,544 --> 01:10:37,012
(Meanwhile, Team Handsome is worried about the question.)

1964
01:10:37,013 --> 01:10:38,753
How were we supposed to predict...

1965
01:10:38,754 --> 01:10:40,874
that they were going to jump from Greg to a beef cut?

1966
01:10:41,584 --> 01:10:44,304
"RnB singing technique was called a cow-driving technique in Korea."

1967
01:10:45,294 --> 01:10:47,054
"Thus, here's a question about a cow's rib."

1968
01:10:47,523 --> 01:10:49,140
"Which meat of the following isn't part of a cow's rib?"

1969
01:10:49,164 --> 01:10:50,833
(The question was full of surprises.)

1970
01:10:50,834 --> 01:10:51,893
It was nice.

1971
01:10:52,563 --> 01:10:54,503
The question was my style.

1972
01:10:54,504 --> 01:10:55,504
That's right.

1973
01:10:55,505 --> 01:10:58,433
If we didn't have a reattempt card... Right?

1974
01:10:59,034 --> 01:11:00,402
- It would've been a disaster.
- Seriously.

1975
01:11:00,403 --> 01:11:01,642
- When we get it wrong, - Yes?

1976
01:11:01,643 --> 01:11:02,643
You feel like...

1977
01:11:03,403 --> 01:11:05,114
the sky has collapsed.

1978
01:11:06,074 --> 01:11:08,812
- You've wasted two hours.
- That's right.

1979
01:11:08,813 --> 01:11:11,953
You also can never come back to this square.

1980
01:11:11,954 --> 01:11:12,954
(It means that you've lost two hours and the square.)

1981
01:11:12,955 --> 01:11:15,084
- There's that feeling.
- It's understandable.

1982
01:11:15,324 --> 01:11:17,693
Let's say we go to Yongin and get the question wrong.

1983
01:11:18,523 --> 01:11:19,723
We'll become nervous.

1984
01:11:20,864 --> 01:11:21,924
We came a long way.

1985
01:11:22,263 --> 01:11:23,794
- Right?
- We're nearly there.

1986
01:11:24,534 --> 01:11:27,163
(They enter the parking lot of the Yongin amusement park.)

1987
01:11:27,164 --> 01:11:28,704
Last year... What?

1988
01:11:29,004 --> 01:11:30,133
That car is with us, right?

1989
01:11:30,134 --> 01:11:31,733
It's the production crew's car. What?

1990
01:11:32,174 --> 01:11:33,174
- That car is with us, right?
- What?

1991
01:11:33,175 --> 01:11:35,103
- What?
- There are production crew's cars.

1992
01:11:35,903 --> 01:11:39,044
Currently, Team Guys is at the spot in Yongin.

1993
01:11:39,544 --> 01:11:41,584
I see. Hurry up and turn the car.

1994
01:11:42,813 --> 01:11:44,013
I think...

1995
01:11:45,084 --> 01:11:47,983
(Since their prediction was off, the situation becomes complicated.)

1996
01:11:48,124 --> 01:11:50,623
They can't take the quiz and come out in one hour.

1997
01:11:50,624 --> 01:11:51,994
So we need to go back to Seongnam.

1998
01:11:52,553 --> 01:11:54,522
I should come here with my kids.

1999
01:11:54,523 --> 01:11:55,593
(Team Guys)

2000
01:11:55,693 --> 01:11:58,464
(Team Guys arrives in Yongin.)

2001
01:11:59,193 --> 01:12:00,834
I think it's my first time coming here.

2002
01:12:01,634 --> 01:12:04,903
Really? You'll come here often when you get married.

2003
01:12:06,374 --> 01:12:08,134
- When I get married?
- Because of children.

2004
01:12:09,244 --> 01:12:12,642
(In any case, this is...)

2005
01:12:12,643 --> 01:12:14,723
(the land of dreams and fantasy, an amusement park.)

2006
01:12:14,983 --> 01:12:16,013
(Screaming)

2007
01:12:16,483 --> 01:12:20,153
(Whom will they meet at the place of childhood memories?)

2008
01:12:20,584 --> 01:12:24,494
(Street casting)

2009
01:12:25,153 --> 01:12:28,163
It'll be easy to find someone...

2010
01:12:28,164 --> 01:12:30,084
- whose birthday is today.
- It'll be very easy.

2011
01:12:30,193 --> 01:12:31,364
Okay.

2012
01:12:32,393 --> 01:12:34,034
(Looking around)

2013
01:12:35,063 --> 01:12:36,602
Whose birthday is this week?

2014
01:12:36,603 --> 01:12:38,043
- Whose birthday is this week?
- Me.

2015
01:12:38,273 --> 01:12:39,503
- This week.
- When is your birthday?

2016
01:12:39,504 --> 01:12:40,704
- Me.
- What day of this week?

2017
01:12:40,874 --> 01:12:42,073
It's January 22.

2018
01:12:42,074 --> 01:12:43,473
- January 22?
- Yes.

2019
01:12:43,874 --> 01:12:46,173
(Did they find the birthday girl in one go?)

2020
01:12:46,174 --> 01:12:48,842
- Really? This week?
- Yes.

2021
01:12:48,843 --> 01:12:51,253
- Do you have an ID card?
- Yes.

2022
01:12:51,254 --> 01:12:52,682
It's December 23...

2023
01:12:52,683 --> 01:12:54,113
- by the lunar calendar.
- The lunar calendar?

2024
01:12:54,114 --> 01:12:56,623
- So it's January 22.
- Right.

2025
01:12:56,624 --> 01:12:58,293
- Is it January 22?
- Yes, it is.

2026
01:12:58,294 --> 01:12:59,653
This is Handsome Guys, right?

2027
01:12:59,853 --> 01:13:01,092
How do you know the show?

2028
01:13:01,093 --> 01:13:02,562
- I watch it often.
- Really?

2029
01:13:02,563 --> 01:13:03,923
- I watch it often.
- My goodness.

2030
01:13:04,023 --> 01:13:06,833
(Happy birthday to you)

2031
01:13:06,834 --> 01:13:09,503
(Clapping)

2032
01:13:09,504 --> 01:13:11,272
(Happy birthday, dear)

2033
01:13:11,273 --> 01:13:14,302
(What was your name?)

2034
01:13:14,303 --> 01:13:15,842
- It's Su Kyung.
- Jang Su Kyung.

2035
01:13:15,843 --> 01:13:17,102
- Dear Kang Su Kyung - It's Jang Su Kyung.

2036
01:13:17,103 --> 01:13:19,044
- Dear Jang Su Kyung - Dear Jang Su Kyung

2037
01:13:19,244 --> 01:13:21,244
(We need to protect the candle.)

2038
01:13:21,843 --> 01:13:22,942
(Happy)

2039
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:24,983
- Please blow it.
- Thank you.

2040
01:13:25,114 --> 01:13:26,384
It's a bit squished.

2041
01:13:27,053 --> 01:13:28,324
Okay.

2042
01:13:29,353 --> 01:13:30,722
Congratulations.

2043
01:13:30,723 --> 01:13:32,692
- Thank you.
- I'm enjoying the show.

2044
01:13:32,693 --> 01:13:34,253
- Thank you.
- Please be happy.

2045
01:13:34,254 --> 01:13:35,624
- Please win.
- Okay.

2046
01:13:36,124 --> 01:13:39,994
(They completed the mission, so it's time for the fantasy land.)

2047
01:13:40,864 --> 01:13:42,464
(Hopping)

2048
01:13:43,063 --> 01:13:44,704
What? There's Seung Ho too.

2049
01:13:45,973 --> 01:13:47,093
- There's Seung Ho.
- Where?

2050
01:13:47,433 --> 01:13:48,544
- There.
- What?

2051
01:13:48,603 --> 01:13:49,943
- The Lego figure.
- Where is he?

2052
01:13:50,204 --> 01:13:51,272
The brick figure.

2053
01:13:51,273 --> 01:13:52,674
(What is Seung Ho doing there?)

2054
01:13:53,343 --> 01:13:55,943
(Let's seize Yongin.)

2055
01:13:56,914 --> 01:13:58,683
We should wear something like a chicken hat.

2056
01:13:58,954 --> 01:14:00,084
Shall we buy one?

2057
01:14:00,384 --> 01:14:02,083
Children will love coming here.

2058
01:14:02,084 --> 01:14:03,683
Of course. They go insane.

2059
01:14:03,924 --> 01:14:06,353
(An animal headband is a must at an amusement park.)

2060
01:14:06,593 --> 01:14:08,463
It'll be nice to come here in spring and autumn.

2061
01:14:08,464 --> 01:14:09,892
Seriously. It's so nice.

2062
01:14:09,893 --> 01:14:11,763
I should buy one since my hair is messed up.

2063
01:14:12,593 --> 01:14:13,593
Do you want recommendations?

2064
01:14:13,594 --> 01:14:15,504
- Tae Hyun, you seem very excited.
- Here.

2065
01:14:15,704 --> 01:14:17,364
- There's this.
- What?

2066
01:14:17,563 --> 01:14:19,574
Here. Watch.

2067
01:14:20,303 --> 01:14:22,443
(Cute)

2068
01:14:22,574 --> 01:14:23,674
Look at its paws.

2069
01:14:24,303 --> 01:14:26,213
(Laughing)

2070
01:14:26,214 --> 01:14:27,214
Look at this.

2071
01:14:27,215 --> 01:14:28,843
(Roar)

2072
01:14:29,013 --> 01:14:30,783
Look at this. Is it a tiger?

2073
01:14:30,784 --> 01:14:32,213
Seriously.

2074
01:14:32,214 --> 01:14:33,784
- It's nice.
- I like it.

2075
01:14:33,884 --> 01:14:34,884
Shall we buy these two?

2076
01:14:34,885 --> 01:14:36,053
- Yes.
- Okay.

2077
01:14:36,884 --> 01:14:38,624
Its paws are so cute.

2078
01:14:39,353 --> 01:14:41,294
"Let me answer!"

2079
01:14:41,893 --> 01:14:43,523
"Let me answer!"

2080
01:14:44,664 --> 01:14:45,834
This must be the place.

2081
01:14:46,664 --> 01:14:48,133
What? This place...

2082
01:14:48,134 --> 01:14:49,263
What?

2083
01:14:49,433 --> 01:14:50,563
What are they doing here?

2084
01:14:51,433 --> 01:14:52,574
It's happening.

2085
01:14:54,943 --> 01:14:56,103
Is that the person?

2086
01:14:57,674 --> 01:14:58,713
Please share the location.

2087
01:14:58,714 --> 01:15:01,914
(People are interviewing someone.)

2088
01:15:02,744 --> 01:15:05,653
(Working diligently)

2089
01:15:05,853 --> 01:15:08,723
(Fascinated)

2090
01:15:09,124 --> 01:15:10,124
(The interview ends.)

2091
01:15:10,125 --> 01:15:12,254
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2092
01:15:15,063 --> 01:15:16,222
- Hello.
- Hello.

2093
01:15:16,223 --> 01:15:18,732
- Hello.
- Hello.

2094
01:15:18,733 --> 01:15:20,092
- Are you guys from "Cast U?" - Yes, we are.

2095
01:15:20,093 --> 01:15:21,562
That's us. Hello.

2096
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:24,333
- The four of you are a team.
- That's right.

2097
01:15:24,334 --> 01:15:26,203
(Among numerous people, )

2098
01:15:26,204 --> 01:15:29,174
(they find someone who is like a gem.)

2099
01:15:29,574 --> 01:15:34,143
(Handsome Heritage 3: Street Casting)

2100
01:15:34,174 --> 01:15:35,584
- Hello.
- Hello.

2101
01:15:35,943 --> 01:15:38,914
My name is Choi Woo Won and I run a YouTube channel, "Cast U."

2102
01:15:39,584 --> 01:15:42,552
What type of content does the channel deal with?

2103
01:15:42,553 --> 01:15:43,954
On the street,

2104
01:15:43,983 --> 01:15:46,393
we interview attractive people.

2105
01:15:48,464 --> 01:15:50,562
(They cast everyone on the street.)

2106
01:15:50,563 --> 01:15:53,933
(The total number of views are over 230 million.)

2107
01:15:54,093 --> 01:15:56,634
(They find the hidden gems of charms.)

2108
01:15:56,803 --> 01:15:59,674
(The road interview channel that suits the Gen Zers' tastes)

2109
01:15:59,773 --> 01:16:02,504
(Today, they'll cast you.)

2110
01:16:02,803 --> 01:16:05,213
We ask about their charms.

2111
01:16:05,214 --> 01:16:07,173
"How would you rate your appearance out of ten?"

2112
01:16:07,174 --> 01:16:09,842
- I watched that part a lot.
- Yes. That's what we do.

2113
01:16:09,843 --> 01:16:12,152
- There are many short videos.
- Yes.

2114
01:16:12,153 --> 01:16:13,482
What are your criteria?

2115
01:16:13,483 --> 01:16:15,182
There are certain criteria.

2116
01:16:15,183 --> 01:16:17,183
When people watch short-form videos,

2117
01:16:17,284 --> 01:16:19,852
they don't watch more than one second.

2118
01:16:19,853 --> 01:16:22,964
So we choose people who grab our eyes for more than one second.

2119
01:16:23,424 --> 01:16:25,262
We cast those people.

2120
01:16:25,263 --> 01:16:27,062
Is there someone among the three of us...

2121
01:16:27,063 --> 01:16:29,933
who can receive attention for more than one second?

2122
01:16:30,164 --> 01:16:36,303
(Who grabs their attention for more than 1 second?)

2123
01:16:36,773 --> 01:16:38,773
I choose Dong Hyun.

2124
01:16:39,114 --> 01:16:41,013
I choose Dong Hyun.

2125
01:16:41,044 --> 01:16:42,913
- Yes.
- The criteria...

2126
01:16:42,914 --> 01:16:44,594
- You have manly charms.
- The standard...

2127
01:16:45,353 --> 01:16:48,083
- Shall we have a short interview?
- An interview?

2128
01:16:48,084 --> 01:16:49,583
Interview him as you usually do.

2129
01:16:49,584 --> 01:16:51,392
- Me?
- Interview him.

2130
01:16:51,393 --> 01:16:52,793
- Really?
- Yes. Go ahead.

2131
01:16:52,794 --> 01:16:53,794
(An impromptu interview with the charming man, Dong Hyun)

2132
01:16:53,795 --> 01:16:54,963
Do it as you usually do.

2133
01:16:54,964 --> 01:16:56,392
Film him as you usually do.

2134
01:16:56,393 --> 01:16:57,794
- Okay.
- Let's go.

2135
01:16:58,233 --> 01:16:59,493
(Kim Dong Hyun in wonderland)

2136
01:16:59,494 --> 01:17:01,263
- Am I here alone?
- Yes, you're here alone.

2137
01:17:02,103 --> 01:17:04,164
You know, Dong Hyun is charming.

2138
01:17:05,674 --> 01:17:06,703
(Kim Dong Hyun, a charming man)

2139
01:17:06,704 --> 01:17:08,843
(He has the charms of a tiger.)

2140
01:17:09,103 --> 01:17:12,843
(Dong Hyun is hanging out in the amusement park alone.)

2141
01:17:13,544 --> 01:17:15,083
- Hello.
- Hello.

2142
01:17:15,084 --> 01:17:17,584
We're from "Cast U." Would you be okay with a short interview?

2143
01:17:17,914 --> 01:17:18,953
I don't have much time.

2144
01:17:18,954 --> 01:17:20,552
- We'll be done in five minutes.
- Five minutes?

2145
01:17:20,553 --> 01:17:21,852
- Okay.
- All right.

2146
01:17:21,853 --> 01:17:24,183
- Let's begin right away.
- Okay.

2147
01:17:24,384 --> 01:17:25,793
- Hello.
- Hello.

2148
01:17:25,794 --> 01:17:27,254
- Let's get started.
- Okay.

2149
01:17:27,294 --> 01:17:29,562
How would you rate your appearance out of 10?

2150
01:17:29,563 --> 01:17:30,692
About seven points.

2151
01:17:30,693 --> 01:17:32,562
- What's your rank among members?
- Fifth place?

2152
01:17:32,563 --> 01:17:33,932
- Last place?
- No.

2153
01:17:33,933 --> 01:17:35,402
- Fourth place.
- Fourth place.

2154
01:17:35,403 --> 01:17:37,363
- Innocent, cute, or sexy.
- Sexy.

2155
01:17:37,364 --> 01:17:38,733
Show me your sexy side.

2156
01:17:39,103 --> 01:17:40,633
(Sexy body roll)

2157
01:17:40,634 --> 01:17:44,003
(We succeeded in casting Mr. Tiger.)

2158
01:17:44,004 --> 01:17:45,043
(Sexy)

2159
01:17:45,044 --> 01:17:46,613
I learned it this morning.

2160
01:17:46,614 --> 01:17:48,113
Get one million dollars...

2161
01:17:48,114 --> 01:17:49,442
versus going back to ten years ago.

2162
01:17:49,443 --> 01:17:50,883
I'd go back to ten years ago.

2163
01:17:50,884 --> 01:17:53,552
If I go back to ten years ago, I'll get a bigger amount of money.

2164
01:17:53,553 --> 01:17:54,553
How will you do that?

2165
01:17:54,554 --> 01:17:55,834
If I buy 1,000 dollars' worth...

2166
01:17:56,153 --> 01:17:57,953
(Having a happy thought)

2167
01:17:57,954 --> 01:17:59,794
Show me your charm.

2168
01:18:00,393 --> 01:18:01,864
(Roar)

2169
01:18:02,023 --> 01:18:05,092
(Showing a tiger's charms)

2170
01:18:05,093 --> 01:18:06,364
(Giggling)

2171
01:18:06,433 --> 01:18:08,034
(He's doing well.)

2172
01:18:08,063 --> 01:18:09,833
All right. We'll stop here.

2173
01:18:09,834 --> 01:18:11,203
Thank you.

2174
01:18:11,204 --> 01:18:12,902
- All right.
- Is this how it's done?

2175
01:18:12,903 --> 01:18:14,773
This is how a typical interview goes.

2176
01:18:16,903 --> 01:18:19,573
Now, you'll use this team's content.

2177
01:18:19,574 --> 01:18:21,513
You'll cast someone.

2178
01:18:21,943 --> 01:18:23,842
You'll cast someone.

2179
01:18:23,843 --> 01:18:25,283
(Will we cast someone?)

2180
01:18:25,284 --> 01:18:28,423
One member will team up with Woo Won and become...

2181
01:18:28,424 --> 01:18:29,584
Team Creator.

2182
01:18:29,754 --> 01:18:32,294
The rest will be Team Handsome Guys.

2183
01:18:32,324 --> 01:18:34,123
Since I interviewed him,

2184
01:18:34,124 --> 01:18:35,722
I'll team up with Dong Hyun.

2185
01:18:35,723 --> 01:18:37,124
Okay. Let's give it a go.

2186
01:18:37,424 --> 01:18:39,864
(Tae Hyun and Sang Uk are Team Handsome Guys.)

2187
01:18:39,964 --> 01:18:42,803
Cast one person who suits the theme.

2188
01:18:43,164 --> 01:18:45,173
The theme is the lookalike.

2189
01:18:45,174 --> 01:18:46,534
(Find a lookalike!)

2190
01:18:46,674 --> 01:18:48,772
There aren't many people since it's Monday.

2191
01:18:48,773 --> 01:18:50,473
It isn't easy.

2192
01:18:50,544 --> 01:18:52,414
I think she resembles someone.

2193
01:18:52,473 --> 01:18:54,114
They say that I resemble...

2194
01:18:54,574 --> 01:18:56,744
(They find lookalikes.)

2195
01:18:56,813 --> 01:18:59,384
(Whose lookalikes are they?)

2196
01:18:59,983 --> 01:19:01,183
Who do you resemble?

2197
01:19:01,523 --> 01:19:04,423
(The casting process ends.)

2198
01:19:04,424 --> 01:19:06,223
Lookalikes, please enter.

2199
01:19:06,924 --> 01:19:09,223
- She looks the same.
- No way.

2200
01:19:09,523 --> 01:19:10,664
Seriously.

2201
01:19:11,223 --> 01:19:12,364
He looks the same.

2202
01:19:12,634 --> 01:19:15,004
- Who...
- I see the resemblance.

2203
01:19:15,034 --> 01:19:17,803
- Let's have a short interview.
- Okay.

2204
01:19:18,433 --> 01:19:20,972
I didn't expect to see him at an amusement park.

2205
01:19:20,973 --> 01:19:22,874
- Who is he?
- Please introduce yourself.

2206
01:19:23,074 --> 01:19:25,913
Hello, my name is Kim Woo Hyuk.

2207
01:19:25,914 --> 01:19:28,113
I'm in charge of special effects at a theater.

2208
01:19:28,114 --> 01:19:29,283
- Special effects.
- Yes.

2209
01:19:29,284 --> 01:19:31,383
Whom do you resemble? How often do people tell you that?

2210
01:19:31,384 --> 01:19:33,012
I look more like that athlete...

2211
01:19:33,013 --> 01:19:34,352
when I take off my top.

2212
01:19:34,353 --> 01:19:35,453
That sounds good.

2213
01:19:35,454 --> 01:19:36,924
- An athlete?
- An athlete?

2214
01:19:37,183 --> 01:19:38,454
Whom do you resemble?

2215
01:19:39,053 --> 01:19:41,193
How often do people tell you that?

2216
01:19:41,464 --> 01:19:43,624
He's even wearing the same outfit!

2217
01:19:43,664 --> 01:19:45,834
It's as if he prepared it in advance.

2218
01:19:46,233 --> 01:19:47,293
Whom does he resemble?

2219
01:19:47,294 --> 01:19:48,663
It's as if he prepared it in advance.

2220
01:19:48,664 --> 01:19:49,903
Hwang Hee Chan.

2221
01:19:50,334 --> 01:19:51,603
- Hwang Hee Chan.
- Who is it?

2222
01:19:52,273 --> 01:19:55,602
This athlete's photo in a similar outfit got famous.

2223
01:19:55,603 --> 01:19:56,673
Who is it?

2224
01:19:56,674 --> 01:19:57,802
It's Hwang Hee Chan.

2225
01:19:57,803 --> 01:20:00,174
(It's Hwang Hee Chan.)

2226
01:20:01,273 --> 01:20:03,182
- Seo Yeon got it right.
- Really?

2227
01:20:03,183 --> 01:20:04,884
Did she get it right?

2228
01:20:05,053 --> 01:20:07,313
He's Hwang Hee Chan.

2229
01:20:07,414 --> 01:20:09,923
- He's Hwang Hee Chan.
- Hwang Hee Chan.

2230
01:20:09,924 --> 01:20:12,152
He resembles Hang Hee Chan.

2231
01:20:12,153 --> 01:20:14,423
Had you said that he didn't resemble Hwang Hee Chan,

2232
01:20:14,424 --> 01:20:17,263
we would've prepared someone who resembles Kim Jong Min.

2233
01:20:17,763 --> 01:20:19,964
(A member of "Cast U")

2234
01:20:20,193 --> 01:20:22,433
We have everyone.

2235
01:20:22,464 --> 01:20:23,739
Did you complete your military service?

2236
01:20:23,763 --> 01:20:26,273
- Victory!
- Marine Corps? Victory!

2237
01:20:26,334 --> 01:20:27,732
My father doesn't know this,

2238
01:20:27,733 --> 01:20:29,142
but I'm preparing to reenter the military.

2239
01:20:29,143 --> 01:20:31,173
I'm preparing to reenter the military.

2240
01:20:31,174 --> 01:20:32,272
What do you mean by that?

2241
01:20:32,273 --> 01:20:35,043
I joined the Marine Corps to experience the intense training.

2242
01:20:35,044 --> 01:20:36,543
But I want something that's more intense.

2243
01:20:36,544 --> 01:20:38,583
I applied to reenter the military as a member of the Special Forces.

2244
01:20:38,584 --> 01:20:39,883
The 707th Special Missions Group...

2245
01:20:39,884 --> 01:20:41,183
- is my goal.
- It looks like...

2246
01:20:41,384 --> 01:20:43,124
his pride got damaged.

2247
01:20:43,284 --> 01:20:44,284
(A Marine Corps member's feelings got hurt.)

2248
01:20:44,285 --> 01:20:47,392
The Marine Corps training is hard for most people, okay?

2249
01:20:47,393 --> 01:20:49,863
- I did struggle a lot.
- It isn't like that.

2250
01:20:49,864 --> 01:20:50,923
It's impressive.

2251
01:20:50,924 --> 01:20:52,892
He's preparing to reenter behind his father's back.

2252
01:20:52,893 --> 01:20:55,164
- He's a Hwang Hee Chan lookalike.
- He'll get caught.

2253
01:20:55,204 --> 01:20:57,034
- Thank you. That's all.
- Thank you.

2254
01:20:57,433 --> 01:20:58,834
All right.

2255
01:20:59,103 --> 01:21:00,232
As for us...

2256
01:21:00,233 --> 01:21:01,513
(It's Team Handsome Guys' turn.)

2257
01:21:01,903 --> 01:21:06,044
She followed us in a confused state.

2258
01:21:06,443 --> 01:21:08,982
- I thought she resembled someone, - Okay.

2259
01:21:08,983 --> 01:21:10,614
So I recruited her.

2260
01:21:10,683 --> 01:21:12,614
All right. Please introduce yourself.

2261
01:21:12,983 --> 01:21:14,883
Hello, I'm...

2262
01:21:14,884 --> 01:21:18,053
in seventh grade. My name is Yang Seo Yeon.

2263
01:21:18,723 --> 01:21:22,193
Yang Seo Yeon entered a middle school this year.

2264
01:21:22,263 --> 01:21:26,033
So Yeon doesn't know this celebrity,

2265
01:21:26,034 --> 01:21:28,603
but we think she resembles...

2266
01:21:28,704 --> 01:21:32,033
Actress Min Hyo Rin.

2267
01:21:32,034 --> 01:21:33,474
(She resembles Actress Min Hyo Rin.)

2268
01:21:33,834 --> 01:21:36,342
(She does look similar.)

2269
01:21:36,343 --> 01:21:37,603
She does resemble her.

2270
01:21:37,773 --> 01:21:38,843
No.

2271
01:21:39,544 --> 01:21:41,442
- She doesn't know about that.
- She's modest.

2272
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:42,543
(Carefree)

2273
01:21:42,544 --> 01:21:45,784
I think other people's opinions matter more.

2274
01:21:45,884 --> 01:21:47,214
She really resembles Min Hyo Rin.

2275
01:21:47,584 --> 01:21:50,153
- She does resemble Min Hyo Rin.
- She does.

2276
01:21:50,584 --> 01:21:52,592
Congratulations on entering middle school.

2277
01:21:52,593 --> 01:21:55,364
Please say a few words to your parents.

2278
01:21:56,223 --> 01:21:59,993
Mom and Dad, thank you for raising me...

2279
01:21:59,994 --> 01:22:02,863
- until I entered middle school.
- My goodness.

2280
01:22:02,864 --> 01:22:05,432
- She's a good daughter.
- She's a good daughter.

2281
01:22:05,433 --> 01:22:07,173
Being someone's lookalike doesn't matter.

2282
01:22:07,174 --> 01:22:08,473
She's a good daughter.

2283
01:22:09,044 --> 01:22:10,543
- Please study hard.
- Okay.

2284
01:22:10,544 --> 01:22:11,873
- Please stay healthy.
- Okay.

2285
01:22:11,874 --> 01:22:13,543
Please do well in middle school.

2286
01:22:13,544 --> 01:22:15,243
- Thank you.
- All right.

2287
01:22:15,244 --> 01:22:17,244
Let's give Seo Yeon a round of applause.

2288
01:22:17,284 --> 01:22:19,352
- All right.
- Gosh, she's nice.

2289
01:22:19,353 --> 01:22:20,413
(Team Handsome Guys' interview ends.)

2290
01:22:20,414 --> 01:22:21,522
She's nice.

2291
01:22:21,523 --> 01:22:25,294
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2292
01:22:25,893 --> 01:22:27,092
(Yongin: Street Casting)

2293
01:22:27,093 --> 01:22:28,824
You'll get a quiz right away.

2294
01:22:29,593 --> 01:22:31,192
The Ministry of Education recently revealed...

2295
01:22:31,193 --> 01:22:34,263
the rankings of the desired jobs of the elementary schoolers.

2296
01:22:34,393 --> 01:22:37,903
The third place was a creator like Choi Woo Won you just met.

2297
01:22:38,063 --> 01:22:40,472
The second place was a doctor.

2298
01:22:40,473 --> 01:22:42,543
- Elementary schoolers?
- Elementary schoolers.

2299
01:22:42,544 --> 01:22:44,224
The first place has to be a soccer player.

2300
01:22:44,574 --> 01:22:47,043
In that case, which job is the first place?

2301
01:22:47,044 --> 01:22:49,413
- It has to be a soccer player.
- No.

2302
01:22:49,414 --> 01:22:51,754
It's an idol.

2303
01:22:52,153 --> 01:22:54,113
- What do you think? An idol.
- It was a soccer player in my time.

2304
01:22:54,114 --> 01:22:55,923
- Not an idol. A celebrity.
- A celebrity.

2305
01:22:55,924 --> 01:22:57,029
Let's go with a celebrity then.

2306
01:22:57,053 --> 01:22:59,400
- What do you think? An idol.
- It was a soccer player in my time.

2307
01:22:59,424 --> 01:23:00,552
You know,

2308
01:23:00,553 --> 01:23:03,723
I read about it a few days ago and talked to my wife.

2309
01:23:03,964 --> 01:23:05,033
- That's right.
- Is the first place a celebrity?

2310
01:23:05,034 --> 01:23:06,062
The first place is a celebrity.

2311
01:23:06,063 --> 01:23:07,262
- That's right. I read it too.
- So...

2312
01:23:07,263 --> 01:23:09,004
the result was a celebrity.

2313
01:23:09,034 --> 01:23:12,472
All the jobs in this line of work were on the list.

2314
01:23:12,473 --> 01:23:15,174
If it isn't a celebrity, what could be the result?

2315
01:23:15,204 --> 01:23:16,602
- If it isn't a celebrity...
- To be honest,

2316
01:23:16,603 --> 01:23:17,873
I think it's a soccer player.

2317
01:23:17,874 --> 01:23:19,842
Everyone wanted to be a soccer player in my time.

2318
01:23:19,843 --> 01:23:21,442
They asked this question for both boys and girls.

2319
01:23:21,443 --> 01:23:24,142
- Sang Uk, you're so wrong.
- Okay.

2320
01:23:24,143 --> 01:23:26,453
A soccer player is so wrong.

2321
01:23:26,454 --> 01:23:28,894
I'm usually very indecisive, right? But this much is certain.

2322
01:23:29,454 --> 01:23:30,482
Okay.

2323
01:23:30,483 --> 01:23:32,403
- The first place is a celebrity.
- A celebrity.

2324
01:23:32,754 --> 01:23:33,893
A celebrity.

2325
01:23:34,254 --> 01:23:35,363
I'm 20,000-percent sure.

2326
01:23:35,364 --> 01:23:37,522
(Will it be a celebrity?)

2327
01:23:37,523 --> 01:23:38,763
A celebrity.

2328
01:23:38,964 --> 01:23:40,093
Incorrect.

2329
01:23:41,294 --> 01:23:42,302
Hold on.

2330
01:23:42,303 --> 01:23:44,163
- What's up with that study?
- No way.

2331
01:23:44,164 --> 01:23:45,402
Hold on.

2332
01:23:45,403 --> 01:23:47,373
- Not even an idol?
- No.

2333
01:23:47,374 --> 01:23:49,043
- It has to be an idol.
- No.

2334
01:23:49,044 --> 01:23:51,472
- It used to be a soccer player.
- Which company did the study?

2335
01:23:51,473 --> 01:23:52,972
- The Ministry of Education did.
- The Ministry of Education?

2336
01:23:52,973 --> 01:23:54,772
- The Ministry of Education?
- Then we'll try again.

2337
01:23:54,773 --> 01:23:56,812
- We need to try again then.
- We...

2338
01:23:56,813 --> 01:23:58,182
You didn't tell us that it was the Ministry of Education.

2339
01:23:58,183 --> 01:23:59,553
Was it the Ministry of Education?

2340
01:23:59,653 --> 01:24:02,953
I told you that it was the Ministry of Education.

2341
01:24:02,954 --> 01:24:05,323
Hold on. We let our guard down.

2342
01:24:05,324 --> 01:24:06,324
(We let our guard down.)

2343
01:24:06,824 --> 01:24:08,392
If it isn't a doctor, what is it?

2344
01:24:08,393 --> 01:24:09,722
I think it's a soccer player.

2345
01:24:09,723 --> 01:24:12,293
- If it really is a soccer player...
- Seriously.

2346
01:24:12,294 --> 01:24:14,062
- Should we have trusted him?
- You know,

2347
01:24:14,063 --> 01:24:16,562
all the kids wanted to be a soccer player in my time.

2348
01:24:16,563 --> 01:24:19,003
- We have to use it.
- We have to use it.

2349
01:24:19,004 --> 01:24:20,773
I was 100 percent sure. How is it incorrect?

2350
01:24:21,004 --> 01:24:22,473
I'll do a study too.

2351
01:24:22,973 --> 01:24:24,642
Here's a hint.

2352
01:24:24,643 --> 01:24:26,673
Your hint is "Physical."

2353
01:24:26,674 --> 01:24:27,913
(Your hint is "Physical.")

2354
01:24:27,914 --> 01:24:30,214
- Physical?
- He's right. It's a soccer player.

2355
01:24:30,813 --> 01:24:33,284
It's an athlete.

2356
01:24:34,183 --> 01:24:36,383
(Feeling stress)

2357
01:24:36,384 --> 01:24:39,052
- Sang Uk!
- Sang Uk!

2358
01:24:39,053 --> 01:24:40,352
I'm sorry!

2359
01:24:40,353 --> 01:24:41,692
I told you. There were a lot of people...

2360
01:24:41,693 --> 01:24:43,022
who wanted to become an athlete when I was young.

2361
01:24:43,023 --> 01:24:44,123
But...

2362
01:24:44,124 --> 01:24:46,092
you and I are on the older side.

2363
01:24:46,093 --> 01:24:47,093
Things have changed.

2364
01:24:47,094 --> 01:24:48,774
The one from the younger generation knows.

2365
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:49,932
It was an athlete.

2366
01:24:49,933 --> 01:24:51,232
It's because Son Heung Min is really popular.

2367
01:24:51,233 --> 01:24:52,302
Right.

2368
01:24:52,303 --> 01:24:53,772
Sang Uk got us the answer.

2369
01:24:53,773 --> 01:24:54,932
He got it right.

2370
01:24:54,933 --> 01:24:56,143
This is the answer. "Athlete."

2371
01:24:57,943 --> 01:25:00,573
The top desired job of elementary school students.

2372
01:25:00,574 --> 01:25:01,974
- I'm sure it's right.
- "Athlete."

2373
01:25:02,914 --> 01:25:03,914
Correct!

2374
01:25:04,714 --> 01:25:06,113
- Gosh!
- Sang Uk!

2375
01:25:06,114 --> 01:25:07,384
I'm so sorry.

2376
01:25:07,784 --> 01:25:09,123
- Today...
- We should've...

2377
01:25:09,124 --> 01:25:10,564
- trusted you today.
- I'm so sorry.

2378
01:25:10,723 --> 01:25:11,993
- Sang Uk!
- It's okay.

2379
01:25:11,994 --> 01:25:13,624
You should've insisted on your answers.

2380
01:25:14,553 --> 01:25:16,423
- Sang Uk!
- You'll beat me in a fight anyway.

2381
01:25:16,424 --> 01:25:18,933
Gosh. Why were you so stubborn about your answer, Tae Hyun?

2382
01:25:19,393 --> 01:25:22,003
Sang Uk was a bit too detailed with his answers.

2383
01:25:22,004 --> 01:25:24,233
He said it was a soccer player.

2384
01:25:24,504 --> 01:25:25,732
- Right.
- I should've said "athlete."

2385
01:25:25,733 --> 01:25:27,433
From now on, Sang Uk's answers...

2386
01:25:28,103 --> 01:25:29,402
- It should be simplified.
- Right.

2387
01:25:29,403 --> 01:25:31,674
- He said "gladiator" earlier.
- Right.

2388
01:25:31,943 --> 01:25:34,214
"Soccer player" was too specific.

2389
01:25:34,614 --> 01:25:35,943
Sang Uk is great at this.

2390
01:25:36,414 --> 01:25:38,084
We should go to Yangpyeong then.

2391
01:25:38,313 --> 01:25:41,384
Please listen to what I have to say when we're in Yangpyeong.

2392
01:25:41,553 --> 01:25:44,954
I definitely read or heard about it.

2393
01:25:47,653 --> 01:25:48,693
That was close.

2394
01:25:49,794 --> 01:25:52,464
(He collects the food card first.)

2395
01:25:53,634 --> 01:25:54,864
- Tae Hyun!
- What is it?

2396
01:25:55,964 --> 01:25:57,263
Churros!

2397
01:25:57,364 --> 01:25:58,802
- Churros!
- We got this right.

2398
01:25:58,803 --> 01:26:00,963
Shouldn't we be given something like a reattempt card?

2399
01:26:02,004 --> 01:26:04,342
(Right before the quiz)

2400
01:26:04,343 --> 01:26:05,813
It's churros here.

2401
01:26:06,143 --> 01:26:07,913
- Churros?
- I think it's churros here.

2402
01:26:07,914 --> 01:26:09,312
- If we get it right?
- Right.

2403
01:26:09,313 --> 01:26:10,812
- If we get it right?
- It feels that way.

2404
01:26:10,813 --> 01:26:11,983
I love churros!

2405
01:26:12,384 --> 01:26:13,944
He even got it right about the churros.

2406
01:26:14,153 --> 01:26:16,284
I'm on fire today.

2407
01:26:16,983 --> 01:26:17,983
(Team Guys earn Yongin.)

2408
01:26:17,984 --> 01:26:20,192
(Yongin, street casting)

2409
01:26:20,193 --> 01:26:23,624
(Yongin, street casting)

2410
01:26:24,294 --> 01:26:25,333
Churros!

2411
01:26:25,334 --> 01:26:26,432
(Here are your churros.)

2412
01:26:26,433 --> 01:26:28,603
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

2413
01:26:29,263 --> 01:26:30,864
Goodbye.

2414
01:26:31,334 --> 01:26:32,334
Thank you.

2415
01:26:32,335 --> 01:26:34,135
(You must have churros at an amusement park.)

2416
01:26:37,443 --> 01:26:38,443
It's so good.

2417
01:26:40,114 --> 01:26:43,044
(Team Guys heads to Yangpyeong after enjoying their churros.)

2418
01:26:43,913 --> 01:26:45,812
(Endless joy)

2419
01:26:46,413 --> 01:26:48,082
(The tastier...)

2420
01:26:48,083 --> 01:26:50,753
(and even more surprising...)

2421
01:26:51,453 --> 01:26:54,153
(world of content)

2422
01:26:54,352 --> 01:26:56,463
All right. The ramyeon will now go in.

2423
01:27:00,632 --> 01:27:02,272
(We have to make fun of them about this.)

2424
01:27:02,602 --> 01:27:04,232
(Disturbed)

2425
01:27:04,432 --> 01:27:06,772
(Weren't we being looked down on?)

2426
01:27:07,203 --> 01:27:08,572
(Kyung Ho strikes back.)

2427
01:27:08,573 --> 01:27:09,703
(Bring down Team Guys.)

2428
01:27:10,073 --> 01:27:13,173
(Yu Rim's leadership with running)

2429
01:27:14,012 --> 01:27:16,482
(Calmness and dignity)

2430
01:27:16,812 --> 01:27:18,681
(History made by Yu Rim?)

2431
01:27:18,682 --> 01:27:19,682
Me!

2432
01:27:19,683 --> 01:27:20,982
(Cuckoo)

2433
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,323
(It can't end like this.)

2434
01:27:23,682 --> 01:27:25,623
(We have Sang Uk.)

2435
01:27:25,793 --> 01:27:26,992
(The adventurer...)

2436
01:27:26,993 --> 01:27:30,092
(carries on.)

2437
01:27:30,623 --> 01:27:32,261
(This can be seen as a fight.)

2438
01:27:32,262 --> 01:27:33,832
(The last spurt toward victory)

2439
01:27:33,833 --> 01:27:37,102
(An intense battle of brains)

2440
01:27:37,663 --> 01:27:39,032
(A breathtaking race...)

2441
01:27:39,033 --> 01:27:40,503
(to get off work)

2442
01:27:40,873 --> 01:27:42,972
(Which team will laugh in the end?)

2443
01:27:43,302 --> 01:27:45,142
(I want to get off work!)

2444
