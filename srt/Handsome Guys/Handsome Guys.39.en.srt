1
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,990
(One sunny summer day)

2
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,330
(Where did Team Handsome go for today's menu recommendation?)

3
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,970
(Gapyeong Service Area)

4
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,169
(Will they be having the food from the service area today?)

5
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,999
- Hello.
- Hello.

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,209
- Hello.
- Hi.

7
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,440
- Hello.
- Hello.

8
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:50,440
We should load the bigger bags first.

9
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,179
- This...
- Put yours in.

10
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,910
Are you getting enlisted?

11
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,509
This is how athletes normally pack.

12
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:57,656
- I'm serious.
- In the military, you see this.

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,049
It looks like we're going to a public bath.

14
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,089
My goodness.

15
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:01,689
How many products do you put on your face?

16
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:03,219
- This...
- Shampoo, lotion,

17
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:04,389
and mustard?

18
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:05,619
Why do you have mustard?

19
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:06,859
(Why did he bring mustard sauce?)

20
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,959
- What's this?
- Mustard.

21
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,989
What's this?

22
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,430
It's body lotion.

23
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:11,999
Can we load all our stuff?

24
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,299
You have so many skincare products.

25
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,300
Share them with me.

26
00:01:14,301 --> 00:01:16,200
- We can share.
- We can share.

27
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:19,299
Later, you'll get to see how useful...

28
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:20,539
this public bath basket is.

29
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,569
This is so...

30
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:23,450
On your way, stop by a market to buy groceries.

31
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:25,209
- We should?
- Do we have to...

32
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,826
- cook ourselves?
- Buy what you want to eat.

33
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,410
- Buy whatever you want.
- Really?

34
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,579
With our own money?

35
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,079
No, I'll pass you a card at the market.

36
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:32,119
You'll give us a card?

37
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,319
- You'll pay for us?
- Buy however much you want.

38
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,489
"With our own money."

39
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:35,519
We're not paying ourselves?

40
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,759
You're not.

41
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,889
Why are they suddenly being generous?

42
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:39,810
- That's strange.
- That makes is even stranger.

43
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,989
Shall we go?

44
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,160
Sure, let's go.

45
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,360
(Where is Team Handsome heading to?)

46
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,230
It's so nice.

47
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,770
It feels like we're going on a trip.

48
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,710
We're going on a retreat.

49
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:57,079
It's funny how we're in uniforms.

50
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,539
(Team Handsome is going on a retreat today.)

51
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,710
Gapyeong...

52
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,250
There's a lot of things there.

53
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:04,419
- Many go to Gapyeong for a retreat.
- Yes.

54
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,450
- Daeseong-ri.
- Daeseong-ri is popular.

55
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,720
(Daeseong-ri Station)

56
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:09,950
(Daeseong-ri, Gapyeong, is popular for retreats.)

57
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,560
(You must not miss out on these.)

58
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:19,130
(You can enjoy water sports, the best part of a retreat.)

59
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,999
Gapyeong does have the most...

60
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,270
- lodgings and stuff.
- Yes.

61
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,960
(Chuncheon, South Chuncheon, Gangchon)

62
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,169
Imagine today.

63
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,840
How do you think today will go?

64
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:32,939
"Things were much better before."

65
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,509
(He is worried by the staff who are suddenly acting nice.)

66
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:35,909
- Really?
- I'm worried.

67
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,149
But we're going on a retreat.

68
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,179
(What could happen on a retreat?)

69
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,319
You're sure...

70
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,489
it's not an ordinary retreat?

71
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,589
Yes, I think so.

72
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,690
What's there to it?

73
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,119
Isn't this...

74
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,089
how a cliche horror movie...

75
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,329
usually starts?

76
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:50,129
We're chatting in excitement...

77
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,600
on the way to a retreat.

78
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:53,329
And they show a full shot...

79
00:02:53,330 --> 00:02:54,769
of our car.

80
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:56,729
(A prelude to a retreat urban legend)

81
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:58,970
We take a picture, and six guys appear in it.

82
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,639
(Seung Ho makes an eye contact with the empty seat.)

83
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,040
Six people appear in the picture.

84
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:03,369
There's one sitting here.

85
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,839
(Do we look like five people?)

86
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,680
This white thing?

87
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,010
Whatever it is,

88
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:10,426
since it's a retreat, we should enjoy ourselves.

89
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,619
Okay.

90
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,390
(Something scarier than a horror special might be waiting.)

91
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,089
The producer said he'd really give us...

92
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:18,660
- his card this time.
- Yes.

93
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,200
Can we really buy everything we want?

94
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:21,729
- We can.
- I have a bad feeling.

95
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,929
What if we buy and...

96
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,999
What's there to worry about?

97
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,159
Let's just enjoy our retreat.

98
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,329
Yes, just enjoy.

99
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,529
Think about everything...

100
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,530
we've bought so far.

101
00:03:28,531 --> 00:03:29,630
That's right.

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,600
We bought so much.

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,069
It'll be fun.

104
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:34,410
Grocery shopping will be fun too.

105
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:38,280
Are we here? That's a big supermarket.

106
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:40,139
- We're here.
- Thank you.

107
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,380
(They arrive at a supermarket.)

108
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:43,679
It's so peaceful.

109
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,720
Please go in.

110
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,819
As I said,

111
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,919
- here's the card for you to use.
- But...

112
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,689
Can I see the card?

113
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,819
The producer's face says...

114
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,429
that we'll have to pay back later.

115
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,989
The way he gave it to us was like,

116
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,130
"Here, take it."

117
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,530
Even if we have to pay it back,

118
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,729
- nothing much changes.
- That's true.

119
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:04,869
- Let's buy meat first, then.
- Sure.

120
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,669
Meat is there. On the left.

121
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,240
Let's go. We'll catch up later.

122
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,409
Here you go.

123
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,009
It's pork belly.

124
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,840
Here's fresh pork belly.

125
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:14,280
It's tomahawk.

126
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,479
This is incredible.

127
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,479
- Can I get one ribs?
- Sure.

128
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,720
Let's buy it.

129
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,880
Get two.

130
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:21,150
- Sure.
- Two.

131
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,790
We should buy 5kg of meat at least.

132
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,790
- Five kilograms?
- Yes.

133
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,960
One kilogram per person?

134
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,490
Can't we eat that much?

135
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,789
- I'm fine. You eat it.
- The amount...

136
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,159
(The meat lovers are on another level.)

137
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,699
I just need this one.

138
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,746
(Yi Kyung and Tae Hyun choose ingredients for stew.)

139
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:35,100
That's a big price difference.

140
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,639
This is the cheapest. It's three dollars.

141
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,269
(He compares the price and buys the cheapest.)

142
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,739
Do we just need to buy tofu and stuff?

143
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:42,270
Yes, and that's it.

144
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,410
We don't need to buy other stuff.

145
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,809
See them? They're still stuck at the meat section.

146
00:04:46,810 --> 00:04:48,610
(They're still stuck at the meat section.)

147
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,479
Why did you get so much meat?

148
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,979
- Six by five equals thirty.
- This is for one meal.

149
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,980
Five kilograms.

150
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,520
It's 5kg without the tomahawk.

151
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,550
- Then it's fine.
- The meat weights...

152
00:04:55,551 --> 00:04:56,819
five kilograms excluding the tomahawk.

153
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,060
We can have that as a snack.

154
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,390
- Let's go buy ramyeon now.
- Okay.

155
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,960
Ramyeon and kimchi.

156
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,459
This looks delicious.

157
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,429
Don't worry about this.

158
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:08,506
(They add 30 packs of ramyeon.)

159
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,270
The trolley is filled up in the blink of an eye.

160
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,710
- What happened?
- The trolley is heavy.

161
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,740
What's happened in that short while?

162
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,979
- Hello.
- Hello.

163
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:19,109
We got quite a lot.

164
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,709
How many kilograms of meat did they get?

165
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,849
(How many kilograms of meat did they get?)

166
00:05:21,850 --> 00:05:23,510
We only bought 5kg of meat.

167
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,579
I think it's more than that.

168
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,749
(I think it's more than that.)

169
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,219
(And so...)

170
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,290
Shall we pay?

171
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,159
It's 650 dollars. That's not much.

172
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,260
(The total grocery price)

173
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,990
See you.

174
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,190
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

175
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,300
Let's go.

176
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,730
Yi Kyung, how long will it take?

177
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,900
Ten minutes.

178
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,170
- That's pretty nearby.
- Yes.

179
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:45,369
Seven kilograms of meat is shocking.

180
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,776
(Seven kilograms of meat is shocking.)

181
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,120
- What is it?
- We forgot kimchi.

182
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:51,016
- Someone mentioned it just now.
- Someone mentioned kimchi.

183
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,179
We didn't buy kimchi?

184
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,849
We bought so many things and not kimchi?

185
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:55,379
- We didn't buy kimchi?
- Kimchi...

186
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,479
Dong Hyun is pissed.

187
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,549
This is serious.

188
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,849
We bought mushrooms and garlic...

189
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,850
but not kimchi.

190
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:01,896
It's okay. Let's buy it at a nearby convenience store.

191
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,049
Yes, I'm sure they have it.

192
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:04,489
(They'll buy kimchi later.)

193
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,019
The weather is perfect.

194
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,940
The forecast that it would rain all disappeared.

195
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,189
Exactly.

196
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,930
(A bright day as if it was welcoming their first retreat)

197
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,200
We're driving up the mountain.

198
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,929
It must be very secluded.

199
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,229
You're right. Where are we going?

200
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:18,400
(A mountain path full of tall trees)

201
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,940
It's Cheongpyeong Lake in front.

202
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,539
(When you follow the view of the vast Cheongpyeong Lake...)

203
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,250
(that welcomes Team Handsome...)

204
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,580
We're here.

205
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,750
Is this the place?

206
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,250
It's so nice.

207
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,789
- Thanks for driving.
- Thank you.

208
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,819
- Thank you.
- Thanks for driving.

209
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,090
It's nice.

210
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,689
(They take their groceries.)

211
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:43,530
- This might burst.
- Be careful.

212
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,730
Hold the bottom.

213
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,530
I'll put it down and carry it.

214
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,069
- Is this it?
- Yes.

215
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:49,630
Then I'll carry it.

216
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:51,800
Amazing.

217
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,170
- This is amazing.
- What a nice place.

218
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,870
- It's nice.
- It's so cool.

219
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:01,480
(A midsummer day with hot rays of sunlight)

220
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:06,750
(Here is Team Handsome's first retreat location!)

221
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:11,090
(A beautiful terrace facing Cheongpyeong Lake)

222
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:13,889
(It even has a pool...)

223
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:17,760
(that makes you want to jump into it right away)

224
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,070
(A home for Team Handsome to enjoy hot summer)

225
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:25,470
It's hot.

226
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:27,170
Let me open the door for you.

227
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,469
I'm going in.

228
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,410
(Excuse us.)

229
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,756
- We should turn on the AC.
- Turn on the AC.

230
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,009
Put on the coldest setting.

231
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,880
(Put on the coldest setting!)

232
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,020
(He is naturally drawn to the AC in the hot weather.)

233
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,990
(What is this?)

234
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,419
The AC doesn't seem to work.

235
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,520
What?

236
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,390
- That can't be true.
- Is it broken?

237
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,789
It must be broken.

238
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,399
(It must be broken.)

239
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,460
No, that's impossible.

240
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,099
- This isn't...
- The cord is pulled out.

241
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,170
Plug it in.

242
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,299
You can't.

243
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,300
- Just plug it in.
- The cord can't be plugged in.

244
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,470
What?

245
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,409
(What's going on?)

246
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,570
The cord can't be plugged in.

247
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,809
The cord can't be plugged in?

248
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:05,239
We should tell them.

249
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,840
- Okay.
- We should tell them.

250
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:08,750
My goodness.

251
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,019
(The youngest members join them with heavy loads.)

252
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,120
It's such a nice place.

253
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,390
(After putting down the boxes)

254
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,990
If you do this...

255
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,330
You can't.

256
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,690
We have to turn on the AC.

257
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,830
- Why did they tie this up?
- It's so hot.

258
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,859
- Let's open the windows first.
- Why did they tie it up?

259
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,699
- Will it be better that way?
- We'll get some wind at least.

260
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,100
It's so hot.

261
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:31,669
- Get some wind at least.
- It feels even hotter.

262
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,699
- It's hot outside too.
- Is there no AC in other rooms?

263
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,940
Open the door.

264
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,239
There's no AC here.

265
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,309
Here it is.

266
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,640
(There is one!)

267
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,679
(This should work, right?)

268
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,810
Hold on.

269
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,320
The cord...

270
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,390
It's far.

271
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:51,659
- We should bring this up to them.
- The AC...

272
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,690
(What is happening?)

273
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:55,390
There's no socket.

274
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,860
Please turn on the air conditioner.

275
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,459
I beg you.

276
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,206
(Please turn on the air conditioner! I beg you!)

277
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:02,300
Please?

278
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,769
(Who is he talking to?)

279
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:06,839
(Seung Ho returns immediately.)

280
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,540
Why aren't the air conditioners working?

281
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,540
(He tries to call someone.)

282
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,180
- Hello?
- Producer.

283
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,809
- Yes?
- We have...

284
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:18,080
a serious emergency.

285
00:09:18,450 --> 00:09:20,520
We might have to stop shooting.

286
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,750
- I'm serious.
- Why?

287
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:24,059
The AC isn't working.

288
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,289
You really have to do something about the air conditioners.

289
00:09:26,290 --> 00:09:27,489
- Ask him to fix this at least.
- This?

290
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,089
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.

291
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,460
(Producer: I'm on my way!)

292
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,900
Without the AC, I can't breathe.

293
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,970
- It's boiling hot.
- I can't do this.

294
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,370
It's hot. I need the AC.

295
00:09:38,570 --> 00:09:39,740
It's so hot.

296
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,239
- I'm hot.
- Where are you guys?

297
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,979
- The AC.
- Here.

298
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,779
- Come here.
- Come this way, everyone.

299
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:47,380
- It's so hot.
- It's hot.

300
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,549
How is the lodging?

301
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:50,619
It's really nice.

302
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,250
- So far...
- Yes.

303
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,060
I'm satisfied with everything but the AC.

304
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,749
You feel very hot, Dong Hyun, don't you?

305
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:57,789
(He is so close to losing his mind from the heat.)

306
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:58,790
Everyone.

307
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,330
I'll announce the new concept of Team Handsome.

308
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,990
Wasn't it a trip?

309
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,999
It is Life in Shortage...

310
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,230
of Team Handsome.

311
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,629
- "Bujok?" - Yes. "Bujok" life.

312
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,030
"Bujok" as in "tribe?"

313
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:12,799
Do you want us to live in shortage...

314
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,910
or live as a tribe?

315
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:17,410
From now on,

316
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:20,540
you will have to live in shortage of one thing.

317
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,409
Hold on.

318
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:25,220
So it's "bujok" for "shortage,"

319
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,880
- not "tribe?" - Hey.

320
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,089
- Look at...
- Hey.

321
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,589
How much he's sweating on his forehead.

322
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,789
The cameramen are sweating buckets too.

323
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,029
That's why...

324
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,659
- the AC...
- Exactly. All the cords...

325
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:37,529
were tied up using cable ties.

326
00:10:37,530 --> 00:10:39,199
- We have to live without AC?
- That was on purpose?

327
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,699
It's the AC.

328
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,169
The first is...

329
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:43,999
the life without AC.

330
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,100
(The first Life in Shortage: Air conditioner)

331
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,609
Stop yapping and put on the coldest setting.

332
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:50,879
Stop yapping and put on the coldest setting!

333
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,510
(The era of plenty)

334
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,480
(The precious things we overlooked)

335
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,679
(First on the list)

336
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,020
(Air conditioning)

337
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,220
(Can we turn on the air conditioner?)

338
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:10,030
(Air conditioners are usually part of our lives.)

339
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,129
(Turn off...)

340
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,870
(the air conditioning...)

341
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:22,740
(and feel the heat as it is.)

342
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:29,150
(Temperature: 37°C, Humidity: 65 percent)

343
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,520
Hold on.

344
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,050
(Shocked)

345
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:38,159
(Denying reality)

346
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,289
Are you kidding me? The weather...

347
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,990
It's scorching outside.

348
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,530
I can live without a house, but not without air conditioning.

349
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,160
(Laughing)

350
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,669
Unbelievable.

351
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,070
Do we at least get an electric fan?

352
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,670
We'll give you one to share.

353
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,870
We at least need an electric fan.

354
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,740
Won't one air conditioner be better?

355
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,169
(Of course, that's better...)

356
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,309
This week's Life in Shortage...

357
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,909
will end tomorrow at 3pm.

358
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:01,110
(Life in Shortage will end tomorrow at 3pm.)

359
00:12:01,910 --> 00:12:03,710
Do we have to sleep without air conditioning?

360
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,019
It's hot.

361
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,920
(The heat is already getting to me.)

362
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:10,870
Do we have to take multiple showers today?

363
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,219
(His eyes are doing all the talking.)

364
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,460
Back in the day,

365
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:17,400
when I had tough days as an athlete,

366
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,860
I used to shower 6 or 7 times a day.

367
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,029
It does cool you down briefly.

368
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:23,550
Tae Hyun, check out the rascal's face.

369
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,199
(Rascal Seung Ho is sulking.)

370
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,840
I might swear today.

371
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,180
I mean it.

372
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,530
We need to survive only in our boxers.

373
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,449
- Let's not get angry.
- We need to be in our boxers.

374
00:12:35,450 --> 00:12:37,309
- It'll be our loss.
- Stay still.

375
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,319
Let's not get angry.

376
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,450
Try to cool off a bit,

377
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:42,619
and enjoy a meal...

378
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,690
cooked with the ingredients you bought.

379
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,889
You must cook the meat outside on a grill.

380
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,759
- You can't grill it inside.
- Really?

381
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,829
(A fully equipped outdoor barbecue setup)

382
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,660
We have to grill meat on a fire in this heat?

383
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,470
Shouldn't the grilling be done by those who bought the meat?

384
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:59,140
I just lost my appetite.

385
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,009
Let's have bibim noodles instead.

386
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,109
(Laughing)

387
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,279
- In this heat?
- You didn't get any kimchi.

388
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,379
No, we didn't.

389
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,450
If you're going to head out for kimchi,

390
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:10,679
only two can go.

391
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,349
- Should I go?
- I'll go.

392
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,289
- I'll go grocery shopping.
- No, me.

393
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,820
- The two who sat in the front.
- I...

394
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,390
- What is it?
- I know the Gapyeong area well.

395
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:20,659
How about this?

396
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,660
(Seung Ho knows the Gapyeong area well?)

397
00:13:21,661 --> 00:13:23,329
Two of us sat in the front seats,

398
00:13:23,330 --> 00:13:25,230
and the seat were adjusted to our heights.

399
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,529
- The car has to go in reverse.
- Sure.

400
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,730
I'm the one who drove us here.

401
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,729
- I turned the car around.
- What?

402
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,376
I parked it the other way to easily unload our bags.

403
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,309
- Play rock-paper-scissors.
- Okay.

404
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,310
Only two will get to go.

405
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:39,980
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

406
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,810
(Four scissors and one paper)

407
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:42,949
- Okay!
- Hold on a second.

408
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:44,279
- Okay, we're good.
- Right.

409
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,400
(Sang Uk's been eliminated.)

410
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:48,366
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

411
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,890
(Two rocks and two papers)

412
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:52,890
- Okay!
- Let's go.

413
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,759
(In despair)

414
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,899
- We'll get going.
- Gosh, it's hot.

415
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,900
I'm sweating like crazy.

416
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,669
I'm sweating from playing rock-paper-scissors.

417
00:14:02,670 --> 00:14:04,230
It's a good thing we didn't buy kimchi.

418
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,639
This is bad.

419
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,969
(He's sweating already.)

420
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,240
This is really bad.

421
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,910
This is bad.

422
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,379
Can you get us the electric fan?

423
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,410
Sure thing.

424
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,750
This...

425
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,980
Close that door.

426
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:22,220
- That room's cooler.
- Fill the pool.

427
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,750
- What?
- Fill the pool.

428
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,219
Fill the pool.

429
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,630
(The winners noisily head to the air-conditioned car.)

430
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,559
Will we be going to a big supermarket?

431
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,800
Yes, someplace that's far away.

432
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,360
- That's far away?
- Yes.

433
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,200
Let's go to Seoul.

434
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,229
We should buy kimchi...

435
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:39,239
from this delicious place in Seoul.

436
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,299
(Heading to the supermarket while dreaming of going to Seoul)

437
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,270
(They hurry into the car.)

438
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,510
Let's go.

439
00:14:44,511 --> 00:14:46,540
- That's all we need to press.
- Okay. I got it.

440
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,580
Gosh, that's so cool.

441
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,480
I never thought...

442
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,420
they'd turn off the air conditioner.

443
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,896
Being in the car feels like the best vacation.

444
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,890
- Let's go, Dong Hyun.
- Off we go.

445
00:14:56,090 --> 00:14:57,119
It's nice and cool in the car.

446
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,859
Who knew I'd be so grateful for this?

447
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:00,019
(Going to the supermarket to run an errand feels like a treat.)

448
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,360
I doubt we'd get to go again.

449
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:02,690
It seems that way.

450
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,159
We took air conditioning...

451
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,500
for granted.

452
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,400
What are we going to do when we get back?

453
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,640
Let's enjoy it for now.

454
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,009
- That's a wise approach.
- Let's enjoy it.

455
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,940
Let's not worry in advance.

456
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,140
(Meanwhile, back at the pension)

457
00:15:18,141 --> 00:15:20,501
Are we really supposed to be here without air conditioning?

458
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:23,550
(Groaning)

459
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:25,580
The average temperature is 35°C these days.

460
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,150
The other room is better because it gets less sunlight.

461
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,620
It's cooler since it doesn't get any sunlight.

462
00:15:32,990 --> 00:15:36,389
- This spot is cooler too.
- Right here?

463
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,150
- That's because it's in the shade.
- Right.

464
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,529
- It's cooler over here.
- Okay.

465
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,769
Let's stay here, guys.

466
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,869
Right here.

467
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,129
Let's open the windows and...

468
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,370
Come over here instead.

469
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:50,140
(His mic)

470
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,350
(Seung Ho suddenly takes off his mic.)

471
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,210
Are you going to the pool?

472
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:58,450
I'm heading home.

473
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:03,919
I'm heading home. Bye.

474
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:04,920
(He tells the staff he's leaving.)

475
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,920
I'm really leaving.

476
00:16:05,921 --> 00:16:06,989
(Rascal Seung Ho goes off the rails.)

477
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:09,259
Stay still over here. It's the coolest part of the house.

478
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,860
(Stripping)

479
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,630
(Rascal Seung Ho comes out to check the pool.)

480
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,170
(Smack)

481
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,169
(Rascal Seung Ho is grumpy.)

482
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,670
Why don't we close the curtains to block the sunlight?

483
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,780
For everyone.

484
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,380
Where is the sun shining from?

485
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:29,480
(Checking where the sun is)

486
00:16:30,210 --> 00:16:32,320
(Argh!)

487
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,990
(He could've just closed the curtains.)

488
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,289
That's hot.

489
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,060
(Creating a shade indoors)

490
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,490
It's this spot right here.

491
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,599
This is the coolest spot.

492
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,560
(Tae Hyun properly lies down, now with a pillow.)

493
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,669
(It's just how our parents think.)

494
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:50,430
("Stay still and it'll be cool enough.")

495
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,139
(Sang Uk returns after closing the curtains.)

496
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,410
- It's better over here.
- I know.

497
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:56,470
We should just sit still doing nothing.

498
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,279
It gets hotter every time you move.

499
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,180
(Joining in at the best spot Tae Hyun discovered)

500
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:07,580
How are we supposed to stay here until tomorrow?

501
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,620
This is going to be tough.

502
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,259
It won't be easy to endure this until 3pm tomorrow.

503
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,260
Tell me about it.

504
00:17:13,261 --> 00:17:15,160
(Rolling up his pants)

505
00:17:16,090 --> 00:17:17,660
I don't think I can do this.

506
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,369
The floor is nice and cold.

507
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:23,269
The floor is the best.

508
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:24,600
(They're cool for now.)

509
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,200
I should move an inch every five minutes.

510
00:17:27,870 --> 00:17:29,270
To move away from the heated floor.

511
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,779
Also, this...

512
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,839
Here we go.

513
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,979
(Just then, an electric fan is delivered.)

514
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,179
Here's one.

515
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,150
That's the best. It's the coolest over here.

516
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,719
(Whirring)

517
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
This is killing me.

518
00:17:39,721 --> 00:17:41,920
It's so hot. I'm in big trouble today.

519
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,249
- Seung Ho.
- Yes?

520
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:45,420
How's the pool?

521
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,760
Right now, in this weather?

522
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,189
You'll boil in it.

523
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:51,959
- We can't go in there right now.
- We'll be cooked.

524
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,829
It's the coolest over here, so join us.

525
00:17:53,830 --> 00:17:54,830
(It's impossible to swim.)

526
00:17:54,831 --> 00:17:56,199
- That's the spot.
- It's best...

527
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,970
not to do anything and stay on your back.

528
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,299
Life in Shortage?

529
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,469
(Seung Ho takes his spot as well.)

530
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:04,940
At first, I thought we were forming a tribe.

531
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,110
Life without air conditioning?

532
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,479
- If this is how it is, - This is insane,

533
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,850
they'll take something away from us one by one.

534
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,690
We should lie to save ourselves.

535
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,189
That we're fine in the heat?

536
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,220
Yes.

537
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:21,390
(Trying to trick their way out of Life in Shortage)

538
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,729
(The three men sprawled out)

539
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:25,830
So, what now?

540
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:28,970
Why don't we think about what to have for lunch?

541
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,669
We should play rock-paper-scissors...

542
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:33,276
to choose who cooks on the grill outside.

543
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:35,770
Let's not think about it in advance.

544
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:37,469
They'll take their time...

545
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,639
enjoying air conditioning.

546
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,880
I bet they'll take an hour.

547
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,080
Tell me about it.

548
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,310
- Kimchi first?
- Yes.

549
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,750
A bag of ice and some kimchi.

550
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,090
Kimchi's over there. Here we go.

551
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:52,989
Here it is. That's nice.

552
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,159
Let's buy one big package.

553
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,360
- Sure.
- I doubt we need two.

554
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,860
One will do.

555
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,029
- Shall we check over there?
- Sure.

556
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,699
- We'll get the ice last.
- Yes, the ice last.

557
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,269
We'll get ice and ice cream as we leave.

558
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,910
That's right. We don't want them to melt.

559
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,139
(Lingering...)

560
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,270
Where did I see it?

561
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,769
(Lingering...)

562
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,010
It's not here.

563
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:12,680
Should we get a repellent?

564
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,039
A repellent? Sounds good.

565
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,350
- We'll share a bottle.
- Sure.

566
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,750
This is for when we get bitten.

567
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:19,450
- Sounds good.
- You never know.

568
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,219
A block of ice!

569
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,989
- Don't we need this?
- Let's get one.

570
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,120
Let's use this as a pillow.

571
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,819
- Take one.
- Just in case.

572
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,789
- You never know.
- Just in case.

573
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,190
You're not having ice cream, right?

574
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,930
- I should since you never know.
- Just in case?

575
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,529
(Laughing)

576
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,530
Let's just buy this.

577
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:37,399
We'll have this with the ice.

578
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,680
- Sounds good.
- Let's have one.

579
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,400
I bet we'll keep drinking this.

580
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,340
We'll keep having this.

581
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,580
How is this grocery shopping?

582
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,439
It's like we're shopping for an emergency kit.

583
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,580
We buy items "just in case."

584
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:52,320
It's like we're shopping for an emergency kit.

585
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,649
Dong Hyun, here are rice cakes.

586
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,989
- How about some for the road?
- Just in case?

587
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,619
Let's buy some gyeongdan just in case.

588
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,090
- Let's buy this.
- I want this.

589
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,889
- You never know.
- You never know.

590
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:01,429
(They keep shopping because they don't want to leave.)

591
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,529
How about an electric fan?

592
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,030
Why don't I give them a call?

593
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,429
- What?
- To ask what we need.

594
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:07,259
Sure. They don't have it here.

595
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,830
(Calling Tae Hyun to ask what they lack)

596
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,940
- Yi Kyung.
- Is there anything you need?

597
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,739
Us? Just get some ice.

598
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,379
Ice? How about a cup of iced Americano?

599
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:20,939
Sure. Actually, no.

600
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,780
Don't think about going elsewhere.

601
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,679
Don't you want iced Americano?

602
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:28,749
Unless you're back here in ten minutes...

603
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,689
- Don't worry.
- I'll know...

604
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:32,359
you're stalling on purpose.

605
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,419
- Come on.
- We called...

606
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,029
to do right by our brothers...

607
00:20:36,030 --> 00:20:38,959
- and get you iced Americano.
- Forget it.

608
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,600
The kimchi at my place is to die for.

609
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,669
(Unbelievable)

610
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:44,769
That'd take too long, right?

611
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:46,100
We can rush over there.

612
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,539
- You...
- Did you forget to bring anything?

613
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,709
No.

614
00:20:48,710 --> 00:20:50,909
If you're not back here in 15 minutes,

615
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,580
you'll be grilling the meat.

616
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,039
We'll be quick.

617
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,180
Bye.

618
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,049
(Stop enjoying the air conditioning and get back here.)

619
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:58,080
Bye.

620
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,750
See? I knew these guys won't come.

621
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,550
They left a while ago, right?

622
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,819
It's already been 15 minutes.

623
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,190
(But where is Seung Ho?)

624
00:21:06,790 --> 00:21:07,860
It's hot!

625
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:14,670
(Seung Ho is still hung up over the air conditioner.)

626
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:16,650
I'm going to turn on that air conditioner.

627
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,400
How will you turn it on?

628
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,969
(Seung Ho approaches the air conditioner.)

629
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,440
Isn't it broken?

630
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:27,080
I think they tied up the cord with a cable tie.

631
00:21:27,710 --> 00:21:30,450
(Tied tightly so that it can't be plugged in)

632
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,150
(He gets a pair of scissors.)

633
00:21:33,550 --> 00:21:35,520
(Striding forward)

634
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,519
(Cutting)

635
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,330
(He cut it!)

636
00:21:41,430 --> 00:21:42,490
Did you cut it?

637
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,200
(Respect to Rascal Seung Ho)

638
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,759
(Snickering)

639
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,770
(He even plugs in the power cord.)

640
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,340
Indeed.

641
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,400
The rascal thinks differently.

642
00:21:54,170 --> 00:21:56,610
(No one can stop Rascal Seung Ho.)

643
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,309
(Another obstacle: double prevention equipment...)

644
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,910
(to keep them from pressing the buttons)

645
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:02,309
(He simply takes it off.)

646
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:04,150
(Reading the room)

647
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:13,690
(The air conditioner is turned on.)

648
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,190
(The doors are opening.)

649
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,499
(Giggling)

650
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,659
(Surprised)

651
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:20,700
Did you turn it on?

652
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:24,229
(Laughing)

653
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:26,070
He turned it on. Hurry up and stop him.

654
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:28,010
Hurry up. Run.

655
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,109
The boss will come now.

656
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,340
You're unbelievable.

657
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:34,640
(The boss appears.)

658
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:37,300
(He might know it or not, but he closes the window first.)

659
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,819
(The boss approaches.)

660
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,456
(They have 10 seconds until the air conditioner is turned off.)

661
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,489
(He just feels happy for now.)

662
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,990
(Pressing the remote control)

663
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,860
(Unintentionally blocking it)

664
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,790
I was caught. The producer saw me.

665
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,630
(Laughing)

666
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:56,469
(Sighing)

667
00:22:56,470 --> 00:22:58,940
How did he turn it on? He's amazing.

668
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,440
(Happy-go-lucky)

669
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,339
Why won't it work?

670
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,780
(Blocking it with his body)

671
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:08,649
(The air conditioner is turned off.)

672
00:23:08,650 --> 00:23:11,520
Seriously, what am I supposed to do?

673
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,179
What are we going to do today?

674
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:16,190
Everyone, I forgot to give you a notice.

675
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:18,460
- If you forcefully turn on the AC, - Yes?

676
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,560
We'll extend the Life in Shortage by one hour.

677
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,559
Okay.

678
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,829
We didn't know that.

679
00:23:23,830 --> 00:23:26,350
- It's fine now, though, right?
- Yes, from this point forward.

680
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,469
(Rascal Seung Ho, who's burning up, stops rebelling.)

681
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,470
(Meanwhile, the grocery shopping team)

682
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,599
(They're totally enjoying their air conditioned vacation and ice cream.)

683
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,609
Gosh, this is so good.

684
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,986
(They're totally enjoying their air conditioned vacation and ice cream.)

685
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:41,110
(We got all the groceries too.)

686
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:43,970
It would be nice if we go on the next light.

687
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,949
The light is...

688
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:48,050
(The light is still green.)

689
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,820
- That's such a long light.
- Maintain a safe speed.

690
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:53,520
Maintain a safe speed.

691
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:55,130
(It turned red!)

692
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,460
(Relieved)

693
00:23:56,461 --> 00:23:57,560
The next light.

694
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,900
We got caught at a red light.

695
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,470
(Maximum happiness)

696
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:03,969
Gosh, it's tasty.

697
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:05,730
(The ice cream seems especially good today.)

698
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,870
(They also enjoy the rice cakes they bought just in case.)

699
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,980
(The light turns green again.)

700
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,816
- Why did it change so fast?
- Why is it so fast?

701
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,849
(Both saying the same thing)

702
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,309
Why is it so fast? It's an intersection.

703
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:18,750
Why did the light change so fast?

704
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,940
- It's so fast for an intersection.
- That's odd.

705
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,719
Still, I feel energized after eating the ice cream and rice cakes.

706
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,750
Right?

707
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:26,419
You feel much better, right?

708
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:28,701
(With the fast signal, they get closer to their lodging.)

709
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:31,070
You're driving at the proper speed, right?

710
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,399
- Yes, does it seem a bit fast?
- Yes, it's fast.

711
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,129
- Well, right now...
- A water deer might pop out.

712
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:37,030
I'm not even pushing down on the gas pedal.

713
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,699
A water deer might pop out from the mountains.

714
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,999
There might be wild animals. Go slowly.

715
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,680
But I'm not pushing down on the gas pedal.

716
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,410
Why is it so quick on the way back?

717
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:46,810
That was a happy trip.

718
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,380
We're here.

719
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,310
We're here already?

720
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,620
How hot will it be in there?

721
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,520
(Depressed)

722
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:57,589
Gosh, this place looks spooky all of a sudden. It was nice earlier.

723
00:24:57,590 --> 00:24:58,689
(The entrance also seems spooky now for some reason.)

724
00:24:58,690 --> 00:24:59,719
(The grocery shopping team, Dong Hyun and Yi Kyung, arrives.)

725
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,360
It's getting hotter now. The sun is out.

726
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:02,690
It got even hotter.

727
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:04,900
Oh, boy.

728
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:07,660
Where did they all go?

729
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,400
My gosh.

730
00:25:09,401 --> 00:25:10,570
(Over here)

731
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,170
- This is...
- Dong Hyun.

732
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,670
Let's give him a pillow.

733
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,370
Tae Hyun, for you,

734
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,909
we bought a pillow.

735
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,579
(We bought some pillows, just in case.)

736
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,079
- Do you want it?
- Not me. Give him one.

737
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,810
- Here, Sang Uk.
- Give it to Sang Uk.

738
00:25:23,750 --> 00:25:25,750
Where do you find this stuff? Wait, let me try it.

739
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,719
(Nice and cool)

740
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,190
- This is so cool.
- That's awesome.

741
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:37,060
(They safely complete the extra grocery shopping.)

742
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,800
We should eat meat.

743
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,446
Just two of us should grill the meat. Not all of us have to go.

744
00:25:43,470 --> 00:25:44,899
First of all, out of the four of us here,

745
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:47,039
one person should volunteer if you can grill it well.

746
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,310
Honestly, shouldn't one person from the meat team go?

747
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:51,469
- Should Dong Hyun and I grill?
- You're right.

748
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,739
- Yes, you're right.
- We didn't even buy the meat.

749
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,910
- You're not really interested.
- Oh, the meat team.

750
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:57,049
- I'll grill it.
- Then, Sang Uk and I will go.

751
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:59,020
I'll go. Do you want to do it?

752
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:00,919
- I'll grill it.
- "I'll go. Do you want to do it?"

753
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,990
You know that has a ton of subtext to it, right?

754
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,490
Just tell him to rest.

755
00:26:04,590 --> 00:26:06,189
- Well, I was just asking.
- "I'll go. Do you want to do it?"

756
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,190
(Laughing)

757
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,930
No, I was just asking.

758
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,029
- I'll do it.
- No.

759
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,459
Sang Uk, this is... Let's have...

760
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,799
- the older guys rest for now.
- I'll do it.

761
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,360
Then, should I cook some bibim ramyeon?

762
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,469
- We'll set everything up in here.
- Okay.

763
00:26:16,470 --> 00:26:18,446
- I'll go. Do you want to do it?
- Okay. Sounds good.

764
00:26:18,470 --> 00:26:19,500
Thank you.

765
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,100
(Sighing deeply)

766
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:22,739
(In the end, the entire meat team, Dong Hyun, Seung Ho, and Sang Uk, )

767
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,486
(comes outside to barbecue in the sweltering heat.)

768
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,480
Gosh, it's already hot just being here.

769
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:29,049
Gosh, it's hot.

770
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,810
(The temperature has gone up to about 38°C.)

771
00:26:31,350 --> 00:26:33,379
We have to grill the meat really deliciously.

772
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,856
(However, they're determined to eat meat in any way.)

773
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,720
- Shall we go with pork shoulder?
- What?

774
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,496
- Pork shoulder first?
- This has to be good.

775
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,959
We have to sprinkle regular salt on it.

776
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,520
Yes, it's good if you sprinkle salt.

777
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:43,589
(Mr. I'll Do It leads by example.)

778
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:44,830
Is this how an old man does it?

779
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,759
It does feel like we're on vacation, though.

780
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,376
(With the meat on the grill, it's starting to feel like a real trip.)

781
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,529
It does look tasty.

782
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,140
(Please cook quickly.)

783
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,670
Gosh, it is hot if you move around.

784
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,709
Do we have a sieve? This?

785
00:26:57,710 --> 00:26:59,256
(They take the perfectly cooked noodles out.)

786
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,839
(After a few touches from Dad...)

787
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,720
You must've cooked a lot for your kids at home.

788
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:08,419
(He easily makes the bibim ramyeon.)

789
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,719
I should make the stew now.

790
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,660
(Yi Kyung prepares the doenjang stew.)

791
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,919
I'll wash all of the lettuce later.

792
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,929
Tofu...

793
00:27:15,930 --> 00:27:17,790
(He grabs all sorts of vegetables and tofu.)

794
00:27:18,530 --> 00:27:19,700
The minced garlic is...

795
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,869
(Where did I put the minced garlic?)

796
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,900
Here it is.

797
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,570
- I thought this was minced garlic.
- What is it?

798
00:27:28,710 --> 00:27:30,010
It's minced ginger.

799
00:27:30,610 --> 00:27:31,640
What?

800
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,440
Hey, anyone would think this looks like garlic.

801
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:37,710
It wasn't minced garlic. It was minced ginger.

802
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:39,649
I'll mince this garlic.

803
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,790
- When will you do all that?
- It won't take long.

804
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,020
I'm burning up.

805
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:46,890
(He starts cooking the doenjang stew in the extreme heat.)

806
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,429
(Yi Kyung's doenjang stew)

807
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:50,750
(1. Put 3 tablespoons of old-style doenjang in the water.)

808
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:57,000
(2. Chop and add green onions, onions, and other vegetables.)

809
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:02,340
(3. Mince the garlic well and plop it in too!)

810
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:05,640
(Then, after seasoning it with chili powder and black pepper, )

811
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,680
(Yi Kyung's doenjang stew is complete.)

812
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:12,279
(After that, he washes the lettuce...)

813
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,180
(and even prepares the kimchi.)

814
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:18,150
(He even cleans up neatly afterwards.)

815
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,090
(The king of housekeeping)

816
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,730
Man, it's hot.

817
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,629
I'm just cooking, but I'm sweating so much.

818
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:27,470
How hot is it out there for the grilling team?

819
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,670
Gosh, it's hot.

820
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:34,040
I've never had a barbecue feel so unpleasant before.

821
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:38,379
(The meat is being cooked deliciously.)

822
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,240
My back is sweating. Unbelievable.

823
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:42,749
It's hot.

824
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:47,049
(The athletes are being roasted.)

825
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:48,650
- You can step inside for a bit.
- No.

826
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,450
But there is one good thing about being out here.

827
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,766
After standing here, it feels so cool just by stepping slightly away.

828
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,030
- Over here?
- Yes.

829
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
(He escapes to the shade for a bit.)

830
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,360
It's really hot.

831
00:28:59,361 --> 00:29:01,200
(He escapes to the shade for a bit.)

832
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,470
(Gosh, this feels much better.)

833
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,870
(Anyway, they have to grill the meat, but...)

834
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,480
I'm sweating up a storm.

835
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,009
(On top of all that, even the smoke is tormenting them.)

836
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:19,580
Gosh, look at all this smoke.

837
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,579
(Darn! Smoke and heat are attacking my colleagues!)

838
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:23,290
(Save colleagues!)

839
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,189
(So, Seung Ho prepares...)

840
00:29:25,190 --> 00:29:29,360
(a strong fan?)

841
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,689
It's hot. Unbelievably hot.

842
00:29:31,690 --> 00:29:34,100
(But the effect was minimal.)

843
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,329
(What they really need, as they're exhausted from the heat...)

844
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,470
You can eat this.

845
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,300
For real.

846
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,870
How is it?

847
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:44,130
This is the only time you can eat this.

848
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:45,910
This is so savory.

849
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,756
Did you dip that in soybean powder or something?

850
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:50,279
(Sang Uk tries a bite too.)

851
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,510
Gosh, this is just...

852
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,620
(Humming in delight)

853
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:59,620
(They shove meat into their mouths in an attempt to forget the heat.)

854
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,929
- Gosh, it's so good.
- It is.

855
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,660
(The effect was powerful!)

856
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,959
(So, they grill...)

857
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,099
It tastes the best right now.

858
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,570
(And they eat.)

859
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:12,769
(With a piece of meat swallowed with their sweat, )

860
00:30:12,770 --> 00:30:14,570
It's the best, right? This exact combination.

861
00:30:16,510 --> 00:30:21,039
(They successfully fight off the heat!)

862
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,010
The taste in this moment makes you forget the heat.

863
00:30:24,610 --> 00:30:25,819
It's so hot, though.

864
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,479
(The taste of meat that will fight heat with heat)

865
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,020
Yi Kyung, the meat is done.

866
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,890
- Come on. Let's go outside.
- Okay.

867
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,019
It's unbelievably hot over there. For real.

868
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,090
I'm sure it is.

869
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:36,590
Heave-ho.

870
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:40,760
(Yi Kyung's warm doenjang stew is ready.)

871
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,270
(And lastly, )

872
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,270
(the long-awaited meat is done being grilled!)

873
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:48,709
(A hearty meal)

874
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,369
- Yi Kyung, let's eat.
- Okay.

875
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:51,770
(A hearty meal)

876
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,210
Hurry up.

877
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,909
But why is it so hot?

878
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:58,079
- I'm so hungry.
- I mean,

879
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,719
do people go on trips...

880
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:02,050
and have barbecues for lunch in this weather?

881
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,050
Don't people usually eat this for dinner?

882
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,290
That's what I mean.

883
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,819
- We have to eat, though.
- Let's eat first.

884
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,066
- All right. Thank you for the meal.
- Let's enjoy the food.

885
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,229
- It's the hottest time of day now.
- Oh, gosh.

886
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:12,629
- Goodness, this is fun.
- All right.

887
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,529
- It's 2pm. You've all worked hard.
- This is fun.

888
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,199
(Still, their first meal is more valuable as they all worked hard.)

889
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,269
- We all worked hard.
- Tae Hyun made...

890
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:19,540
- the bibim ramyeon and everything.
- Really?

891
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,899
(Then, shall I try the ramyeon first?)

892
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:21,910
It tastes neat.

893
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,210
It's tasty.

894
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,470
But how...

895
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:26,010
It's tasty.

896
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:29,250
(Seung Ho tries a bite too.)

897
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,509
Just doenjang? Store-bought doenjang?

898
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,650
Yes, but it's...

899
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:36,419
Put a bunch of green onion kimchi on top.

900
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,140
(With a bunch of green onion kimchi on top)

901
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,519
The meat is, to be honest...

902
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:44,490
(Slurping up a storm)

903
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,659
(Yi Kyung's doenjang stew is selling well too.)

904
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,730
Does it taste okay?

905
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,200
I didn't add salt to this.

906
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,199
The doenjang stew tastes all right.

907
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,739
- It's good.
- Really?

908
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,240
It's good even without any salt.

909
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,569
It tastes neat.

910
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:58,639
Gosh, this is...

911
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,410
(Tae Hyun gets ready to make a lettuce wrap.)

912
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,349
(He dips a piece of pork shoulder in the ssamjang...)

913
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:08,820
(and puts it straight into his mouth.)

914
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:12,019
(Dong Hyun tries a wrap too.)

915
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,620
Gosh, if you eat this stuff,

916
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:17,000
it doesn't really make you gain too much of an appetite.

917
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:20,829
(The barbecued meat satisfies everyone's taste buds.)

918
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:21,929
This is good.

919
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:25,200
(The barbecued meat satisfies everyone's taste buds.)

920
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:30,070
(However, the greatest obstacle for this lunch)

921
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,680
Gosh, it really is hot.

922
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,950
(Even as they sit still and eat, )

923
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:43,490
(sweat drips down like rain.)

924
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,619
What kind of trip...

925
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,300
makes you sweat as you eat during the day?

926
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,989
(That would be our trip.)

927
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,130
If it's this hot,

928
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,229
you'd think we wouldn't eat grilled meat.

929
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:54,429
(If it's this hot, you'd think we wouldn't eat grilled meat.)

930
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:55,430
We're impressive.

931
00:32:57,530 --> 00:33:00,739
(Not grilling meat?)

932
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,770
(We'll have an extra order of pork belly.)

933
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,850
Isn't this enough food?

934
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,480
Aren't you full?

935
00:33:11,350 --> 00:33:13,020
But the pork belly does look good.

936
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:15,749
The meat gets digested right away.

937
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,589
(The light eaters lose their appetite in the heat wave.)

938
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,660
Isn't that right?

939
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,959
(Meanwhile, the athletes eat voraciously...)

940
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,390
(as if swallowing the heat.)

941
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:30,900
(This is how they beat the heat.)

942
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,739
(As the single tribe eats in two different styles...)

943
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,020
The development of civilization.

944
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,810
(Feeling groggy)

945
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,640
(Tae Hyun puts an ice cube in his mouth.)

946
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,079
(That looks nice and cool.)

947
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,550
- Over there...
- This looks good.

948
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,919
If you lay on the sun beds...

949
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,919
and tan your skin, it would be amazing. Right?

950
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,200
(Yi Kyung gets an ice cube too.)

951
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,959
Gosh, Tae Hyun. This tastes good too.

952
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,989
Am I breathing smoke?

953
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,310
(The ice cube feels pretty cool.)

954
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,560
Isn't that candy?

955
00:33:56,990 --> 00:33:59,230
(Slurping)

956
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,269
(He takes it out of his mouth and puts it on Dong Hyun.)

957
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,500
Lower the temperature.

958
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,470
Oh, that's cool.

959
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:06,899
Hey, that's really cool.

960
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,100
Just by doing this...

961
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:10,440
Gosh, it's cool.

962
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,839
(This time, he goes over to Seung Ho.)

963
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,179
This lowers your body temperature.

964
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,209
- It's steaming.
- But didn't this...

965
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,279
come out of your mouth?

966
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,280
(Yes, it did.)

967
00:34:18,281 --> 00:34:19,801
Still, I rubbed it on Dong Hyun first.

968
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,680
What?

969
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,249
- Nice.
- I rubbed it on Dong Hyun first.

970
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:24,789
Hey, your neck is steaming.

971
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,019
This is what family is all about.

972
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,089
I should've done this earlier.

973
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:28,536
- My gosh.
- Can I pour this on my head?

974
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,590
Go ahead.

975
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,390
- Just pour it like that.
- Wait.

976
00:34:31,391 --> 00:34:32,829
Dong Hyun, you and I...

977
00:34:32,830 --> 00:34:34,660
have so much ash on our heads.

978
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,670
I'll do it for you.

979
00:34:38,870 --> 00:34:40,339
- That must feel so cool.
- Don't let it pour down my face.

980
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:41,599
- To the back of my head.
- To the back?

981
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,339
- On my head and down my back.
- Everyone is...

982
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,610
not in their right minds.

983
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,010
- Are you ready?
- Okay, nice.

984
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,710
Nice.

985
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,280
Nice.

986
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,880
This side.

987
00:34:52,250 --> 00:34:53,750
Gosh, that's cool.

988
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:55,950
Gosh, that's cool.

989
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,850
- That looks nice.
- Gosh, that's cool.

990
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,020
(Sputtering)

991
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,489
(You get a free face wash.)

992
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,359
- Was there that much water?
- I'm fine.

993
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,960
There was quite a lot.

994
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,630
It's fine.

995
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,729
Okay.

996
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,370
- Which game should we play?
- What?

997
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,140
Let's play a game. Loser has to clean up.

998
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:13,600
Then, let's draw noodles.

999
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:15,370
The person with the shortest noodle?

1000
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,010
- Nice.
- Okay.

1001
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:19,339
No mixing things around.

1002
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,579
- When you touch it, you're done.
- You have to pick it up right away.

1003
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:22,109
When you touch it, you're done.

1004
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,149
- I'll go with this one.
- Done.

1005
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:24,279
(Focused)

1006
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,560
- I'll go with this one.
- Done.

1007
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,580
Oh, it looks long.

1008
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,419
- No!
- You're done!

1009
00:35:29,420 --> 00:35:30,450
Oh, it looks long.

1010
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,949
- No!
- You're done!

1011
00:35:31,950 --> 00:35:33,389
- This one.
- There it is.

1012
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,489
This one. Done.

1013
00:35:34,490 --> 00:35:35,490
Okay.

1014
00:35:35,490 --> 00:35:36,490
Why? Did it break off?

1015
00:35:36,491 --> 00:35:37,530
- It broke off.
- It did!

1016
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,799
Oh, they might get cut off.

1017
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,099
- Hang on.
- Yes, they're all bloated.

1018
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,676
- They snap off right away.
- Let's try it.

1019
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,429
- You got too greedy.
- Wait, this is...

1020
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:46,039
I think we only need to choose two people.

1021
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,240
To clean up and do the dishes.

1022
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,769
Don't let it get cut off.

1023
00:35:49,770 --> 00:35:51,839
- Okay.
- My gosh.

1024
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:53,679
- You're in the safe zone.
- Okay.

1025
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,739
You won't be able to top that.

1026
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,750
This is pretty much like the worm game.

1027
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,579
I'll go with this one.

1028
00:35:58,580 --> 00:35:59,719
This one is going to get cut off.

1029
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,019
(Pausing)

1030
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,149
- You're doomed.
- This is...

1031
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,290
one noodle.

1032
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:06,059
- Hey, you never know.
- Still...

1033
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,259
But my loss is already decided.

1034
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,859
- Right now, he's...
- Two of us will clean?

1035
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,889
- Yes.
- It's your turn.

1036
00:36:09,890 --> 00:36:10,959
(The fourth person, Dong Hyun)

1037
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,599
This is all right. This is so easy.

1038
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,730
This one.

1039
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:16,829
- It disappeared.
- Wait.

1040
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,169
- Where did it go?
- No!

1041
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,640
- That's it.
- Hey!

1042
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,969
- I saw it.
- That's it.

1043
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:23,130
I watched you from the beginning in case you did this.

1044
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,810
- Hey, man.
- I'm safe.

1045
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,339
Didn't you overcook this too much?

1046
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,356
(Didn't you overcook this too much?)

1047
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,439
It just snapped right off.

1048
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,279
- I told you it was bloated.
- Hey, this is...

1049
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,410
I'm not sure, okay?

1050
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,279
- I don't know if it's really long.
- All right.

1051
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,280
This one.

1052
00:36:34,281 --> 00:36:35,349
- It's right here.
- Just once.

1053
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:36,519
- If it falls...
- You have to grip it well.

1054
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:37,990
(The noodle gets cut off!)

1055
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,159
- You're done!
- That's it!

1056
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,260
- No, it's this one.
- This one.

1057
00:36:44,090 --> 00:36:45,629
- Hey, this is a close call.
- Hang on.

1058
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,830
- Stretch it out.
- All right.

1059
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:47,929
Stretch it out.

1060
00:36:47,930 --> 00:36:49,029
(And the one remaining person?)

1061
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:50,069
Sang Uk lost.

1062
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:52,099
Yi Kyung won.

1063
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,470
(Yi Kyung wins!)

1064
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,610
Dong Hyun and Sang Uk.

1065
00:36:55,910 --> 00:36:57,010
One-on-one?

1066
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,170
- One-on-one?
- One-on-one?

1067
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,339
We don't need two people! One person can clean up!

1068
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,609
- Are you sure? He wants to do it.
- Let's go!

1069
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:03,679
One person can clean up.

1070
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,849
- We don't need two people.
- You really can't look.

1071
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:06,619
- Both of you should go at once.
- Okay.

1072
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:07,779
- Let's draw it together.
- Okay.

1073
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:09,489
- At the same time.
- You have to choose right away.

1074
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:10,549
- Gosh, this is...
- Choose your noodles.

1075
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,789
- At the same time.
- Okay.

1076
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,790
One, two, three!

1077
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,119
I'll take this one.

1078
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,160
(Unlike Dong Hyun, who has settled in one spot...)

1079
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,599
I'll draw mine from nearby.

1080
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,799
Hey, how much closer are you going to get?

1081
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,529
- Are you done? Ready, go.
- Okay.

1082
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:25,969
(What will the result be?)

1083
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:27,270
- Okay.
- Ready, go.

1084
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,410
(What?)

1085
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:31,410
It's the same noodle.

1086
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,480
(The link between you and me)

1087
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,350
Gosh, seriously!

1088
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:37,679
- Unbelievable.
- They picked the same one.

1089
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,779
Hey, you can't do that! I picked a good one.

1090
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,719
It was just drooping over the side.

1091
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,150
Gosh, I can't believe this.

1092
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,620
I picked a good one.

1093
00:37:45,450 --> 00:37:46,789
I'll take this one.

1094
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,089
- This one?
- Don't come closer.

1095
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,430
Move over!

1096
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:51,530
- Move over!
- Wait.

1097
00:37:51,590 --> 00:37:52,599
I'll take this one.

1098
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,600
Are you ready?

1099
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:55,710
- This one.
- That's it. You have to pick that.

1100
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:59,070
(Focused)

1101
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:01,599
I'll cut off Dong Hyun's...

1102
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,670
(The same strand)

1103
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,139
- How can this happen?
- Hey!

1104
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,609
- You...
- I was farther away this time.

1105
00:38:09,610 --> 00:38:11,149
- How did that happen?
- This makes no sense.

1106
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,479
- No way!
- This makes no sense.

1107
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,179
- For real.
- How does this make sense?

1108
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,449
Are you two meant to be?

1109
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:16,450
How can this happen?

1110
00:38:16,451 --> 00:38:17,849
I really picked one from the outer edge.

1111
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,290
What are the odds of this happening?

1112
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,360
All right. This is really the last game.

1113
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,759
(Trying to avoid the pull of destiny)

1114
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,059
I'll go with this one.

1115
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,489
- This one.
- You chose that one?

1116
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:26,850
(The two guys' desperate struggle)

1117
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,229
(What will be the result?)

1118
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:29,529
Are you done? I'm all set.

1119
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,846
Sang Uk, you have to pull it out well.

1120
00:38:30,870 --> 00:38:32,339
It would be crazy if you picked the same one again.

1121
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,340
Okay.

1122
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,340
(Short)

1123
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,939
It might get cut off. Don't let that happen.

1124
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:38,260
(Dong Hyun wins as long as he picks the noodle up safely.)

1125
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:42,479
Sang Uk loses!

1126
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,850
(Sang Uk has to clean up!)

1127
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:46,119
Still, we have to see which one is longer and shorter.

1128
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,149
- What?
- Let's compare them.

1129
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:48,150
What are you saying?

1130
00:38:48,151 --> 00:38:49,490
Why did you eat it?

1131
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:53,560
I can put these two back inside.

1132
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,460
Gather all of the food in here.

1133
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,629
That? Let's put...

1134
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,790
(They gather the food they'll eat again in one place.)

1135
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,329
We can save what we can.

1136
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,600
(The dishes get stacked up.)

1137
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:06,640
(They each lend a helping hand.)

1138
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,810
(Thanks to their help, everything gets cleaned up soon.)

1139
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,710
(But the mountain of dishes are for Sang Uk to wash.)

1140
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:23,220
(The loser starts washing dishes.)

1141
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,520
I'll cut up the watermelon.

1142
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:26,960
Okay.

1143
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,659
(Preparing a watermelon for dessert to forget about the heat)

1144
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:30,180
Let's only eat half of the watermelon.

1145
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,660
Should I make it easy to eat?

1146
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:40,670
(He starts removing the rind.)

1147
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,180
(Only the red part of the watermelon is left.)

1148
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:52,250
(Then, he cuts it up into bite-sized pieces.)

1149
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:55,889
Finished.

1150
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:58,390
(Get ready for watermelon.)

1151
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,829
(Sang Uk is still diligently washing the dishes.)

1152
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,630
It must be hard for you since you're so tall.

1153
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:07,600
No, it's just that the grease isn't washing off easily.

1154
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,000
These ones, you have to wash twice.

1155
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:11,230
Hand it to me and I'll rinse.

1156
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,439
- No, just wash up. I'll do it.
- No.

1157
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,440
It's nice to feel the cold water.

1158
00:40:15,441 --> 00:40:16,946
(Will you enjoy a dish washing date with Sang Uk?)

1159
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,340
I washed it once.

1160
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,080
Okay, let me see how it feels.

1161
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,580
The grease is...

1162
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:23,479
The grease won't wash off.

1163
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,280
(The two guys wash dishes together, standing shoulder to shoulder.)

1164
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:30,520
(Once Sang Uk washes, Yi Kyung rinses.)

1165
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:34,490
(Their height difference makes your heart flutter somehow.)

1166
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,159
(Then, a game changer appears.)

1167
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,260
Can you rinse this once?

1168
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:40,960
I'll put them on here.

1169
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:48,200
(Seung Ho is bothered by those two.)

1170
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,121
(And Yi Kyung keeps watching Seung Ho with his guard up.)

1171
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:54,510
(What will come at the end of the romantic dishwashing?)

1172
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,710
Shall we move the fan to the living room?

1173
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:57,950
Shall we do that?

1174
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,879
- Tae Hyun!
- Yes?

1175
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,050
Have a slice of watermelon.

1176
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,649
- Okay.
- We'll eat in the living room.

1177
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:03,920
Okay. Let's go.

1178
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,759
- Enjoy the food.
- Enjoy the food.

1179
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,760
(It's watermelon time.)

1180
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,430
It's hot.

1181
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,000
What a weather. If we can leave tomorrow...

1182
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,999
- We have 24 hours left.
- Yes.

1183
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,606
(More than 24 hours remain of Life in Shortage.)

1184
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:19,370
(They're exhausted from living without an air conditioner.)

1185
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,039
(They replenish their energy and coolness with watermelon.)

1186
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,570
Is the worst of the heat over?

1187
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,880
(The current temperature outside: 39°C)

1188
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:34,380
(The production crew approaches them quietly.)

1189
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:36,849
Producer, please leave because it's hot.

1190
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:37,919
I'm sorry.

1191
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,949
(The production crew appears.)

1192
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,590
Please leave because it's hot. Why is everyone coming inside?

1193
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,560
We lowered the temperature.

1194
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:44,890
You guys are scaring us again.

1195
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,780
You had a lot of experience regarding the heat.

1196
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,129
Please take a look at this.

1197
00:41:50,130 --> 00:41:51,299
- What?
- Please watch it together.

1198
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,329
(Tossing)

1199
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:53,400
What is it?

1200
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,899
(Chuckling)

1201
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:56,369
- Hold on a second.
- What is it?

1202
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:57,840
Even the paused section is scary.

1203
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,180
Is it a challenge?

1204
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,150
- It's a dance.
- I'll play it.

1205
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,089
(An automatic reaction)

1206
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:12,290
Look at that footwork.

1207
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:17,659
(They watch the video because they've received it.)

1208
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,660
What's this?

1209
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,029
(Let's see.)

1210
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,030
How is it so hard?

1211
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,140
We enjoyed the video.

1212
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,839
- We enjoyed the video by TWS.
- TWS is good.

1213
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,909
I've listened to the song many times.

1214
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:36,150
Throw it away.

1215
00:42:37,810 --> 00:42:39,449
If you practice this choreography for an hour...

1216
00:42:39,450 --> 00:42:42,280
and succeed in doing it at once,

1217
00:42:42,590 --> 00:42:44,430
we'll turn on the air conditioner for an hour.

1218
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,336
Will you turn it on for an hour?

1219
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,419
Shouldn't it be for a longer period of time? Seriously.

1220
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,059
- The reward isn't big enough.
- For an hour...

1221
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,389
Wouldn't it be better to sit still without doing anything?

1222
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:52,459
Exactly.

1223
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,799
(The first mission of Life in Shortage, Dance Challenge)

1224
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,099
(Learn the choreography of "Plot Twist" by TWS.)

1225
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:00,739
(If you succeed in it at once, )

1226
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:03,509
(you'll earn the right to use the air conditioner for 1 hour!)

1227
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,430
It's better to sit still without doing anything.

1228
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:08,279
We managed to cool own enough to keep the sweat...

1229
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,349
from rolling down.

1230
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:11,249
- And you want us dance for an hour?
- There's no balance whatsoever.

1231
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,549
At the very least, it should be for two hours.

1232
00:43:12,550 --> 00:43:13,879
- Two hours.
- Then we might consider it.

1233
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,379
- Two hours minimum.
- I won't do it.

1234
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,549
If it's for two hours, we'll think about it.

1235
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,189
But here's the problem.

1236
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,759
We can't learn that choreography in an hour.

1237
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,520
- You're right.
- Do they take us for singers?

1238
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:23,929
(A former dance singer)

1239
00:43:23,930 --> 00:43:25,390
We need an instructor.

1240
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:28,760
We thought that you might find the choreography difficult.

1241
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:30,700
An instructor is here to help.

1242
00:43:30,770 --> 00:43:31,770
Are you serious?

1243
00:43:31,771 --> 00:43:33,539
Do you mean a choreographer?

1244
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,369
Why did you call an instructor to this place?

1245
00:43:35,370 --> 00:43:37,209
Who? Is it someone who isn't in the production crew?

1246
00:43:37,210 --> 00:43:38,969
The instructor doesn't deserve this.

1247
00:43:38,970 --> 00:43:40,480
- Hello.
- What?

1248
00:43:41,110 --> 00:43:42,440
- What?
- Is the instructor...

1249
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:44,579
- Hold on a second.
- It's Lia Kim!

1250
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,920
(A guest surprises Handsome Guys!)

1251
00:43:47,326 --> 00:43:48,455
- Hello.
- Hello.

1252
00:43:48,456 --> 00:43:49,556
- What?
- What?

1253
00:43:49,726 --> 00:43:51,256
- What?
- Is the instructor...

1254
00:43:51,456 --> 00:43:53,525
- Hold on a second.
- It's Lia Kim!

1255
00:43:53,526 --> 00:43:55,725
(A guest surprises Handsome Guys!)

1256
00:43:55,726 --> 00:43:56,865
An actual instructor is here.

1257
00:43:56,866 --> 00:43:58,165
- Hold on.
- No way.

1258
00:43:58,166 --> 00:44:00,236
(Lia Kim appears.)

1259
00:44:00,706 --> 00:44:02,165
(The director of choreography for the music video...)

1260
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:03,606
(of BLACKPINK's new song, "Jump")

1261
00:44:03,876 --> 00:44:07,575
(The leader of 1MILLION, the center of the K-pop dance)

1262
00:44:07,576 --> 00:44:10,146
(Lia Kim)

1263
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,845
(She took over the street dance and choreography scenes.)

1264
00:44:14,846 --> 00:44:18,685
(She's the one and only icon.)

1265
00:44:18,686 --> 00:44:21,626
(The all-time legend, Lia Kim)

1266
00:44:21,726 --> 00:44:22,955
An actual instructor is here.

1267
00:44:22,956 --> 00:44:24,226
- Hold on.
- No way.

1268
00:44:24,326 --> 00:44:25,395
Hold on.

1269
00:44:25,396 --> 00:44:26,695
Why did you invite a legend?

1270
00:44:26,696 --> 00:44:28,826
What is Lia Kim doing here?

1271
00:44:29,436 --> 00:44:30,765
Why is it so hot in here?

1272
00:44:30,766 --> 00:44:32,812
- We can't use the air conditioner.
- We can't use the air conditioner.

1273
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:35,265
We can only use it if you help us learn a choreography.

1274
00:44:35,266 --> 00:44:37,505
- That's right. I'm here...
- This is driving me crazy.

1275
00:44:37,506 --> 00:44:39,305
To help you guys succeed in the mission.

1276
00:44:39,306 --> 00:44:40,505
Will it be possible? We've never danced before.

1277
00:44:40,506 --> 00:44:42,745
I have a question. The five of us have no dance skills whatsoever.

1278
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:44,475
- Will it be possible to learn...
- Will it be possible?

1279
00:44:44,476 --> 00:44:45,816
The choreography of TWS?

1280
00:44:46,076 --> 00:44:47,316
Firstly,

1281
00:44:47,516 --> 00:44:49,286
I specialize in teaching the beginners.

1282
00:44:50,116 --> 00:44:51,156
Thus...

1283
00:44:51,456 --> 00:44:52,885
You're a legend.

1284
00:44:52,886 --> 00:44:54,006
(Trust me to work my magic.)

1285
00:44:54,186 --> 00:44:56,356
As you speak, you're sweating so much.

1286
00:44:56,696 --> 00:44:57,725
- Lia Kim...
- It's so hot in here.

1287
00:44:57,726 --> 00:45:00,295
We'll prepare a separate fan for Lia.

1288
00:45:00,296 --> 00:45:01,825
You should prepare a separate fan.

1289
00:45:01,826 --> 00:45:02,836
(Sweating)

1290
00:45:02,896 --> 00:45:04,542
Then let us use the air conditioner for two hours.

1291
00:45:04,566 --> 00:45:06,866
An hour and a half? You should round it up.

1292
00:45:07,336 --> 00:45:09,617
- Let's go with an hour and a half.
- An hour and a half?

1293
00:45:09,906 --> 00:45:11,406
Okay. Let's give it a try.

1294
00:45:11,936 --> 00:45:13,545
I watched the choreography.

1295
00:45:13,546 --> 00:45:15,946
You need to learn the formation and everything.

1296
00:45:16,006 --> 00:45:18,515
One person needs to sit.

1297
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:20,185
But sitting down is hard.

1298
00:45:20,186 --> 00:45:21,945
You need to sit down incredibly fast.

1299
00:45:21,946 --> 00:45:23,186
You need to sit down like this.

1300
00:45:26,956 --> 00:45:30,895
(You need to sit down in the speed of light.)

1301
00:45:30,896 --> 00:45:33,126
I need one person who can sit down quickly.

1302
00:45:33,226 --> 00:45:34,395
- The easy one.
- But this person won't have...

1303
00:45:34,396 --> 00:45:35,425
a lot of dance moves.

1304
00:45:35,426 --> 00:45:37,236
- I see.
- It's the easiest one.

1305
00:45:37,296 --> 00:45:38,865
It'll be better to sit down first.

1306
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:42,066
Let's have a match. Let's see who can sit down the fastest.

1307
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:43,775
- Shall we do that?
- Let's do it.

1308
00:45:43,776 --> 00:45:44,975
- The one who can sit the fastest.
- Yes.

1309
00:45:44,976 --> 00:45:46,375
(Seung Ho sits down as soon as they finish talking.)

1310
00:45:46,376 --> 00:45:48,705
You're surprised, right? I'm sitting down already.

1311
00:45:48,706 --> 00:45:49,745
(Shameless)

1312
00:45:49,746 --> 00:45:51,915
Sit down at once from a standing position.

1313
00:45:51,916 --> 00:45:53,485
- Okay. Let's go.
- Let's have a match.

1314
00:45:53,486 --> 00:45:55,845
From a standing position, I can sit down...

1315
00:45:55,846 --> 00:45:58,115
as if someone had removed the foothold underneath me.

1316
00:45:58,116 --> 00:45:59,215
- Really?
- One at a time.

1317
00:45:59,216 --> 00:46:00,536
Someone has removed the foothold.

1318
00:46:02,256 --> 00:46:03,555
(The movement that seems to come from experience)

1319
00:46:03,556 --> 00:46:04,956
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1320
00:46:05,026 --> 00:46:07,625
- You didn't fall down, did you?
- I did a breakfall.

1321
00:46:07,626 --> 00:46:08,926
He did a breakfall.

1322
00:46:09,326 --> 00:46:10,965
I think that'll be enough.

1323
00:46:10,966 --> 00:46:12,166
(It wasn't half bad.)

1324
00:46:12,336 --> 00:46:14,005
It's a bit scary.

1325
00:46:14,006 --> 00:46:15,006
How is it scary?

1326
00:46:15,366 --> 00:46:17,275
(Timid)

1327
00:46:17,276 --> 00:46:19,206
(That won't do.)

1328
00:46:19,406 --> 00:46:21,406
Do you know that I'm a heavyweight member in here?

1329
00:46:21,806 --> 00:46:23,245
- It takes him a while to go down.
- He can't do it.

1330
00:46:23,246 --> 00:46:24,526
It takes him a while to go down.

1331
00:46:28,246 --> 00:46:29,246
He can't do it.

1332
00:46:29,247 --> 00:46:30,315
(It takes him ages to go down.)

1333
00:46:30,316 --> 00:46:31,356
Seriously.

1334
00:46:31,856 --> 00:46:33,956
Just now, I had a fear of heights.

1335
00:46:34,826 --> 00:46:36,396
It definitely takes you longer.

1336
00:46:37,056 --> 00:46:38,495
Seung Ho, you can sit down quickly.

1337
00:46:38,496 --> 00:46:39,726
I can sit down quickly.

1338
00:46:40,526 --> 00:46:41,565
(Let's see.)

1339
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:43,686
You won't get a pillow during the actual performance.

1340
00:46:44,236 --> 00:46:46,356
You won't get a pillow during the actual performance.

1341
00:46:46,636 --> 00:46:48,835
It's very important to prevent an injury.

1342
00:46:48,836 --> 00:46:50,005
- But...
- What's wrong with you?

1343
00:46:50,006 --> 00:46:51,175
You should know better as a former athlete.

1344
00:46:51,176 --> 00:46:52,922
You won't get it during the actual performance.

1345
00:46:52,946 --> 00:46:54,646
(It was a feint, you punk.)

1346
00:46:55,106 --> 00:46:56,615
I can sit down right away.

1347
00:46:56,616 --> 00:46:58,575
I can do it while getting ready.

1348
00:46:58,576 --> 00:47:00,985
(Fascinated)

1349
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:02,045
In that case,

1350
00:47:02,046 --> 00:47:04,916
- I think Seung Ho should sit down.
- Okay.

1351
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,685
We need one center member.

1352
00:47:07,686 --> 00:47:08,686
(They need 1 center member.)

1353
00:47:08,687 --> 00:47:11,725
Isn't the center member usually handsome?

1354
00:47:11,726 --> 00:47:13,566
- I recommend Sang Uk.
- Sang Uk should do it.

1355
00:47:13,596 --> 00:47:16,566
- He's the tallest.
- I really can't dance.

1356
00:47:16,996 --> 00:47:18,466
Let's give it a try.

1357
00:47:18,666 --> 00:47:20,165
Sang Uk should be the center member...

1358
00:47:20,166 --> 00:47:21,705
- since he's handsome.
- No.

1359
00:47:21,706 --> 00:47:23,005
Let's give it a try.

1360
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,505
- You can do it.
- Shall we do that? Shall we go?

1361
00:47:24,506 --> 00:47:26,035
- Let's go with Sang Uk.
- Okay.

1362
00:47:26,036 --> 00:47:27,076
Okay.

1363
00:47:27,446 --> 00:47:30,045
- Center member, come here.
- Me?

1364
00:47:30,046 --> 00:47:31,745
- The sitting member...
- Me.

1365
00:47:31,746 --> 00:47:33,885
- Now, come here.
- Okay.

1366
00:47:33,886 --> 00:47:35,015
Here. Yes.

1367
00:47:35,016 --> 00:47:40,085
In the beginning, you go, 1, 2, 1.

1368
00:47:40,086 --> 00:47:41,486
That's what the center member does.

1369
00:47:41,756 --> 00:47:46,426
(An important part that marks the beginning of the challenge)

1370
00:47:46,766 --> 00:47:48,266
- One, - One,

1371
00:47:48,396 --> 00:47:50,165
- two.
- two.

1372
00:47:50,166 --> 00:47:52,735
One, two, three. Throw it.

1373
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:54,165
- Three, four.
- Yes.

1374
00:47:54,166 --> 00:47:56,065
- He's good.
- The rest of the members...

1375
00:47:56,066 --> 00:47:57,736
As for the two members on the sides...

1376
00:47:58,676 --> 00:48:00,746
One, two. Turn around.

1377
00:48:00,906 --> 00:48:03,415
Then you come up. Two, three. Put your finger on it.

1378
00:48:03,416 --> 00:48:04,475
- That's how you do it.
- Like this?

1379
00:48:04,476 --> 00:48:05,775
- Yes.
- Do I turn around as well?

1380
00:48:05,776 --> 00:48:07,415
- To the right.
- You and I will do this.

1381
00:48:07,416 --> 00:48:09,985
Turn to the right. Yes.

1382
00:48:09,986 --> 00:48:12,785
Start from the bottom.

1383
00:48:12,786 --> 00:48:14,955
- Tae Hyun's body...
- How do you do it?

1384
00:48:14,956 --> 00:48:17,156
- keeps making cracking sounds.
- From here...

1385
00:48:17,296 --> 00:48:19,355
Sit down with your knees bent.

1386
00:48:19,356 --> 00:48:22,325
Come up like this and put your finger on it.

1387
00:48:22,326 --> 00:48:24,566
- I put my finger on it.
- Yes.

1388
00:48:24,836 --> 00:48:26,296
- Yes.
- Okay.

1389
00:48:26,636 --> 00:48:27,965
- That's how you do it.
- Lia, what should I do?

1390
00:48:27,966 --> 00:48:30,076
- The two of you...
- Do we do the same thing?

1391
00:48:30,236 --> 00:48:33,345
- Turn around and do this.
- Okay. I understand.

1392
00:48:33,346 --> 00:48:34,705
Sit down and go,

1393
00:48:34,706 --> 00:48:36,975
- one, two, three, four.
- Okay.

1394
00:48:36,976 --> 00:48:39,245
All members throw their hands at the same time.

1395
00:48:39,246 --> 00:48:41,786
Thus, this part is the same.

1396
00:48:41,816 --> 00:48:44,155
- One, two. Turn around.
- One, two.

1397
00:48:44,156 --> 00:48:46,856
One, two, three, click. That's how you do it.

1398
00:48:47,756 --> 00:48:49,055
Hold on. Do I turn around as well?

1399
00:48:49,056 --> 00:48:50,595
- No, you don't.
- I don't do it, right?

1400
00:48:50,596 --> 00:48:51,896
That's right. Now...

1401
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,495
How much did we cover?

1402
00:48:54,496 --> 00:48:56,535
- It's just the beginning.
- How many seconds did we cover?

1403
00:48:56,536 --> 00:48:58,235
About two seconds.

1404
00:48:58,236 --> 00:49:00,306
- Two seconds.
- It's before the actual start.

1405
00:49:01,136 --> 00:49:03,076
(We have a long way to go.)

1406
00:49:03,476 --> 00:49:04,606
It's so hot.

1407
00:49:06,176 --> 00:49:07,645
(Sweating)

1408
00:49:07,646 --> 00:49:11,775
- All right. Let's do it at once.
- At once.

1409
00:49:11,776 --> 00:49:13,646
- We're idols.
- Get ready.

1410
00:49:13,846 --> 00:49:16,585
Five, six, seven, eight.

1411
00:49:16,586 --> 00:49:19,086
- One, two.
- One, two.

1412
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:21,886
(Perfect teamwork)

1413
00:49:22,086 --> 00:49:24,525
One, two, three, click.

1414
00:49:24,526 --> 00:49:26,156
That's right.

1415
00:49:26,466 --> 00:49:28,695
(Clapping)

1416
00:49:28,696 --> 00:49:30,136
- Did we do it right?
- Was it okay?

1417
00:49:30,536 --> 00:49:32,065
I could only see myself.

1418
00:49:32,066 --> 00:49:33,735
Did that really deserve an exclamation?

1419
00:49:33,736 --> 00:49:36,505
It was really cool. Totally.

1420
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:37,506
(It feels nice.)

1421
00:49:37,507 --> 00:49:39,505
Five, six, seven, eight.

1422
00:49:39,506 --> 00:49:41,805
- One, two.
- One, two.

1423
00:49:41,806 --> 00:49:43,976
One, two, three, click.

1424
00:49:44,746 --> 00:49:46,485
- All done.
- It's easy.

1425
00:49:46,486 --> 00:49:48,186
All done. You guys are doing great.

1426
00:49:48,386 --> 00:49:50,516
You guys have a chance. Now...

1427
00:49:51,386 --> 00:49:53,185
(Let's learn the choreography in earnest.)

1428
00:49:53,186 --> 00:49:54,186
- That part will come out.
- That part?

1429
00:49:54,187 --> 00:49:55,455
Yes. That part will come out.

1430
00:49:55,456 --> 00:49:57,526
- May we watch the video again?
- Okay.

1431
00:49:57,696 --> 00:50:00,566
- I'm sweating.
- It's so hot.

1432
00:50:01,426 --> 00:50:03,196
- Now...
- Let's watch it.

1433
00:50:03,866 --> 00:50:05,635
(Serious)

1434
00:50:05,636 --> 00:50:06,636
That's the part.

1435
00:50:06,866 --> 00:50:08,806
One, two, three, click.

1436
00:50:10,076 --> 00:50:12,436
That's when you sit down.

1437
00:50:12,706 --> 00:50:13,745
Okay.

1438
00:50:13,746 --> 00:50:14,846
And...

1439
00:50:15,276 --> 00:50:17,646
Before we move along with the choreography...

1440
00:50:18,116 --> 00:50:19,815
We think it'll be better for you guys...

1441
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:20,985
to learn in a comfortable way...

1442
00:50:20,986 --> 00:50:22,222
- since Lia is here.
- That's right.

1443
00:50:22,246 --> 00:50:23,955
During the dance lesson, you can use the air conditioner.

1444
00:50:23,956 --> 00:50:25,155
That sounds good.

1445
00:50:25,156 --> 00:50:26,902
But if you succeed in the mission, you can use it for an hour.

1446
00:50:26,926 --> 00:50:28,225
- Okay.
- That sounds like a deal.

1447
00:50:28,226 --> 00:50:29,455
- That's a deal.
- That sounds like a deal.

1448
00:50:29,456 --> 00:50:30,456
Seriously.

1449
00:50:30,456 --> 00:50:31,456
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1450
00:50:31,457 --> 00:50:33,056
It was getting too hot for Lia.

1451
00:50:33,366 --> 00:50:35,665
We turned on the air conditioner thanks to Lia.

1452
00:50:35,666 --> 00:50:36,666
Seriously.

1453
00:50:36,896 --> 00:50:38,635
Put it on the turbo mode.

1454
00:50:38,636 --> 00:50:39,696
(Gathered around)

1455
00:50:40,966 --> 00:50:42,965
(Turning on the air conditioner)

1456
00:50:42,966 --> 00:50:45,836
(The most serious)

1457
00:50:46,006 --> 00:50:47,045
It's 29°C in here.

1458
00:50:47,046 --> 00:50:49,375
- It's on the air purifier mode.
- It's close to 30°C.

1459
00:50:49,376 --> 00:50:51,016
Let's put it on the air conditioner mode.

1460
00:50:51,476 --> 00:50:52,676
That's what I'm talking about.

1461
00:50:53,816 --> 00:50:55,115
(The air conditioner is on, so they resume practicing.)

1462
00:50:55,116 --> 00:50:56,716
Let's move on with the choreography.

1463
00:50:57,016 --> 00:51:00,085
Sit down and take a short break.

1464
00:51:00,086 --> 00:51:01,185
A short break.

1465
00:51:01,186 --> 00:51:02,225
- Good.
- It's a break.

1466
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:04,695
Now, the four of you will learn the choreography together.

1467
00:51:04,696 --> 00:51:05,896
- We'll do it together.
- Yes.

1468
00:51:10,466 --> 00:51:14,665
(The choreography has cute details while being refreshing.)

1469
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:17,836
Put your left foot up and keep your head down.

1470
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:19,806
- Yes.
- How does she stand like that?

1471
00:51:19,876 --> 00:51:21,746
At "The first," put up one finger.

1472
00:51:22,146 --> 00:51:24,576
"The first." Afterward, do this.

1473
00:51:25,416 --> 00:51:26,516
"Meeting."

1474
00:51:27,386 --> 00:51:29,246
- "The first meeting." - "Meeting."

1475
00:51:29,616 --> 00:51:31,586
- Does this hand go down too?
- Yes.

1476
00:51:31,756 --> 00:51:32,756
(Dong Hyun is struggling from the start.)

1477
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:34,756
- "The first..." - "Meeting."

1478
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,546
- It's the palm on the second beat.
- It's confusing.

1479
00:51:37,696 --> 00:51:39,526
After this, show your palm again.

1480
00:51:40,026 --> 00:51:41,126
- Really?
- Yes.

1481
00:51:41,266 --> 00:51:42,395
I should just... Gosh, it's confusing.

1482
00:51:42,396 --> 00:51:45,165
Let's try it. Set, go.

1483
00:51:45,166 --> 00:51:47,866
(Let's practice slowly.)

1484
00:51:48,066 --> 00:51:50,036
- "The first." - "The first."

1485
00:51:50,776 --> 00:51:53,546
(The three of them follow along with ease.)

1486
00:51:53,746 --> 00:51:55,175
- And "The first." - Hold on.

1487
00:51:55,176 --> 00:51:57,245
- Hold on.
- "Meeting."

1488
00:51:57,246 --> 00:51:58,275
What was I supposed to do with my hand?

1489
00:51:58,276 --> 00:51:59,276
(His body and head work separately.)

1490
00:51:59,277 --> 00:52:00,285
(Laughing)

1491
00:52:00,286 --> 00:52:01,745
Salute as you go down.

1492
00:52:01,746 --> 00:52:02,746
- As you go down.
- It's confusing.

1493
00:52:02,747 --> 00:52:05,016
"The first..." Salute.

1494
00:52:05,256 --> 00:52:06,586
Up. That's how it goes.

1495
00:52:07,056 --> 00:52:08,925
- "The first..." - Listen.

1496
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:10,495
There's nothing else. There's no hand gesture.

1497
00:52:10,496 --> 00:52:11,925
- Like this?
- There's no hand gesture.

1498
00:52:11,926 --> 00:52:13,665
(He creates a new choreography.)

1499
00:52:13,666 --> 00:52:14,825
(What is he going to do?)

1500
00:52:14,826 --> 00:52:15,896
There's no hand gesture.

1501
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,342
- "The first..." - Then you show the palm.

1502
00:52:17,366 --> 00:52:18,665
- "Meeting." - "Meeting."

1503
00:52:18,666 --> 00:52:19,666
- Yes.
- "The first..."

1504
00:52:19,966 --> 00:52:21,335
- "Meeting." - "Meeting."

1505
00:52:21,336 --> 00:52:22,765
We can't get past the three words.

1506
00:52:22,766 --> 00:52:24,275
We went over "The first meeting" so many times.

1507
00:52:24,276 --> 00:52:25,435
(The first dance is too hard.)

1508
00:52:25,436 --> 00:52:26,505
I don't think my mistake will be obvious.

1509
00:52:26,506 --> 00:52:27,666
- Can't I just do this?
- No.

1510
00:52:28,276 --> 00:52:29,476
- Okay. "The first..." - Okay.

1511
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:30,845
- "meeting." - "Meeting."

1512
00:52:30,846 --> 00:52:31,915
- Okay.
- Yes.

1513
00:52:31,916 --> 00:52:33,175
- Like this?
- That's right.

1514
00:52:33,176 --> 00:52:35,016
Afterward, cross your arms.

1515
00:52:35,416 --> 00:52:38,916
With your left foot, go... "Is too hard."

1516
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:42,085
The head is in the same direction. Twist the foot to the left.

1517
00:52:42,086 --> 00:52:43,846
- Outward.
- The head and foot are the same.

1518
00:52:43,926 --> 00:52:45,886
- The head and foot are the same.
- That's right.

1519
00:52:46,096 --> 00:52:47,765
That's right. Only the arms go in the opposite direction.

1520
00:52:47,766 --> 00:52:48,766
- So...
- I got it.

1521
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,395
- "Is too hard." - Dong Hyun.

1522
00:52:50,396 --> 00:52:52,966
Cross your arms. Don't do it like the arm bar.

1523
00:52:53,096 --> 00:52:55,135
This is how we do a wrestling grip.

1524
00:52:55,136 --> 00:52:56,656
(The choreography turned quite scary.)

1525
00:52:56,706 --> 00:52:58,335
After "Is too hard,"

1526
00:52:58,336 --> 00:52:59,605
we have, "Ddugudang."

1527
00:52:59,606 --> 00:53:00,705
It's hard.

1528
00:53:00,706 --> 00:53:01,805
- It's so...
- One more time.

1529
00:53:01,806 --> 00:53:04,245
All right. Push up your right shoulder twice.

1530
00:53:04,246 --> 00:53:05,845
- "Ddugudang." - "Ddugudang."

1531
00:53:05,846 --> 00:53:07,516
- "Ddugudang." - Okay. "Ddugudang."

1532
00:53:07,846 --> 00:53:09,386
Then comes "Nothing."

1533
00:53:09,516 --> 00:53:10,656
- "Nothing." - "Nothing."

1534
00:53:10,816 --> 00:53:12,155
- That's it. Just open your arms.
- "Nothing."

1535
00:53:12,156 --> 00:53:13,485
- "Nothing..." - "Nothing."

1536
00:53:13,486 --> 00:53:15,526
- "goes..." Put the knees together.
- "Goes."

1537
00:53:15,756 --> 00:53:16,855
I can't put them together.

1538
00:53:16,856 --> 00:53:19,056
- Do we need to put them together?
- Yes, the knees.

1539
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:21,866
(Coy)

1540
00:53:21,896 --> 00:53:24,235
- "Nothing goes according..." - "Goes..."

1541
00:53:24,236 --> 00:53:25,465
"Nothing."

1542
00:53:25,466 --> 00:53:26,805
Shall we try it once? Set, go.

1543
00:53:26,806 --> 00:53:30,376
(They quickly go over what they've learned.)

1544
00:53:31,076 --> 00:53:34,745
(Despite being slow, Handsome Guys learn diligently.)

1545
00:53:34,746 --> 00:53:35,846
Yes.

1546
00:53:36,146 --> 00:53:39,446
Then comes, "To plan."

1547
00:53:39,846 --> 00:53:41,762
Hit the head and stomp the foot at the same time.

1548
00:53:41,786 --> 00:53:43,146
"To plan."

1549
00:53:43,246 --> 00:53:44,916
And... That's it.

1550
00:53:46,086 --> 00:53:48,625
(He's doing it correctly, but it looks strange.)

1551
00:53:48,626 --> 00:53:50,025
"To..."

1552
00:53:50,026 --> 00:53:52,226
Then turn your head once. "Plan."

1553
00:53:52,726 --> 00:53:54,825
This really doesn't suit my disposition.

1554
00:53:54,826 --> 00:53:56,625
- Let's stop here.
- It's different from what I do.

1555
00:53:56,626 --> 00:53:57,695
(He's sweating so much.)

1556
00:53:57,696 --> 00:53:59,496
Out of 100 percent, how much have we learned?

1557
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:00,835
- What? We've only learned...
- I'm sweating so much.

1558
00:54:00,836 --> 00:54:02,105
- about 30 percent.
- That's good.

1559
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:03,106
- What?
- It's so hard.

1560
00:54:03,107 --> 00:54:04,235
We've learned 30 percent.

1561
00:54:04,236 --> 00:54:05,705
How am I supposed to memorize it?

1562
00:54:05,706 --> 00:54:07,646
Will it be possible? I can't memorize it.

1563
00:54:08,006 --> 00:54:09,845
Let's see you guys do the dance at the same time.

1564
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:11,215
- From the start?
- Let's go.

1565
00:54:11,216 --> 00:54:12,846
- From the start?
- Yes.

1566
00:54:13,116 --> 00:54:15,715
Five, six, seven, eight.

1567
00:54:15,716 --> 00:54:17,015
- One, - One,

1568
00:54:17,016 --> 00:54:18,116
- two.
- two.

1569
00:54:18,286 --> 00:54:20,385
- One, two, three, - One, two, three,

1570
00:54:20,386 --> 00:54:21,386
- click.
- four.

1571
00:54:21,387 --> 00:54:22,555
- "The first..." - Are we throwing our hands?

1572
00:54:22,556 --> 00:54:24,355
- "meeting is..." - "Meeting is..."

1573
00:54:24,356 --> 00:54:25,995
- "too hard." - "too hard."

1574
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:27,125
Let's start over.

1575
00:54:27,126 --> 00:54:28,396
All right, everyone.

1576
00:54:28,796 --> 00:54:30,896
(Laughing)

1577
00:54:30,996 --> 00:54:33,536
(Will we be able to turn on the air conditioner?)

1578
00:54:33,866 --> 00:54:35,566
Everyone, watch.

1579
00:54:35,936 --> 00:54:37,496
Do this as soon as you throw your hand.

1580
00:54:37,836 --> 00:54:39,435
- Like this?
- Yes.

1581
00:54:39,436 --> 00:54:41,006
- Okay.
- Let's try it. Get ready.

1582
00:54:41,306 --> 00:54:43,915
Five, six, seven, eight.

1583
00:54:43,916 --> 00:54:45,976
- One, two.
- One, two.

1584
00:54:46,476 --> 00:54:48,085
One, two, three.

1585
00:54:48,086 --> 00:54:49,215
- Right away!
- Click!

1586
00:54:49,216 --> 00:54:51,685
"The first meeting is..."

1587
00:54:51,686 --> 00:54:53,385
(The shout wakes them up.)

1588
00:54:53,386 --> 00:54:54,485
- Come on!
- "Nothing..."

1589
00:54:54,486 --> 00:54:56,856
(The shout wakes them up.)

1590
00:54:57,626 --> 00:55:02,496
(However, this member is still struggling.)

1591
00:55:05,866 --> 00:55:07,035
Did I do it correctly?

1592
00:55:07,036 --> 00:55:09,235
Didn't it look like Dong Hyun was being possessed?

1593
00:55:09,236 --> 00:55:10,405
(Shocked)

1594
00:55:10,406 --> 00:55:12,306
- I...
- Are you okay?

1595
00:55:12,336 --> 00:55:14,205
- I did it correctly.
- Are you okay?

1596
00:55:14,206 --> 00:55:15,852
Why don't you watch Dong Hyun dance by himself?

1597
00:55:15,876 --> 00:55:17,076
- Please take a look.
- Okay.

1598
00:55:18,046 --> 00:55:20,085
(He's always half a beat behind.)

1599
00:55:20,086 --> 00:55:21,215
(Moving shyly)

1600
00:55:21,216 --> 00:55:23,286
(Turning and creaking)

1601
00:55:23,516 --> 00:55:26,285
"Goes according to plan."

1602
00:55:26,286 --> 00:55:30,625
(He continues to do the dance at his own pace.)

1603
00:55:30,626 --> 00:55:32,356
- Did I do it correctly?
- At this point...

1604
00:55:32,426 --> 00:55:35,195
At this point, you did nothing wrong.

1605
00:55:35,196 --> 00:55:36,425
- I'm just slow, right?
- Yes.

1606
00:55:36,426 --> 00:55:38,165
He's cute. It's okay because he's lovely.

1607
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:39,366
(It's okay because he's cute.)

1608
00:55:39,496 --> 00:55:41,035
- Shall we move on?
- Okay.

1609
00:55:41,036 --> 00:55:43,505
Okay. This part has difficult beats...

1610
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,776
and difficult steps.

1611
00:55:49,146 --> 00:55:53,115
(It obviously looks difficult.)

1612
00:55:53,116 --> 00:55:55,615
(Lia gives a demonstration first.)

1613
00:55:55,616 --> 00:55:57,486
It's very fast. That's the beat.

1614
00:55:57,586 --> 00:55:59,456
Did they cram in so many moves in four words?

1615
00:56:01,026 --> 00:56:02,426
They crammed them in there.

1616
00:56:02,526 --> 00:56:04,526
We'll do the footwork first. Watch.

1617
00:56:04,726 --> 00:56:07,226
- Go out and come back in.
- Go out and come back in.

1618
00:56:07,566 --> 00:56:09,296
Kick twice.

1619
00:56:09,596 --> 00:56:12,295
Once to the back. Once to the front.

1620
00:56:12,296 --> 00:56:13,466
- Like this?
- Yes.

1621
00:56:13,906 --> 00:56:15,466
- Once to the front.
- Like this?

1622
00:56:16,366 --> 00:56:18,506
Yes. That's it.

1623
00:56:19,276 --> 00:56:20,276
Yes.

1624
00:56:20,446 --> 00:56:21,846
- That's it.
- I got it.

1625
00:56:21,876 --> 00:56:23,615
(Laughing)

1626
00:56:23,616 --> 00:56:26,516
Front, back. Kick, kick.

1627
00:56:26,646 --> 00:56:27,686
Okay.

1628
00:56:27,716 --> 00:56:29,285
- You're really good.
- Of course.

1629
00:56:29,286 --> 00:56:30,485
- It's nothing.
- Let's try it again.

1630
00:56:30,486 --> 00:56:31,685
- Kick, kick.
- Kick.

1631
00:56:31,686 --> 00:56:33,755
Your left foot is forward, right?

1632
00:56:33,756 --> 00:56:36,586
Lean on your left foot. Step, step. Jump, jump.

1633
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:37,895
- Step, step.
- Yes.

1634
00:56:37,896 --> 00:56:39,095
We do the same with our bodies.

1635
00:56:39,096 --> 00:56:40,625
- That's right.
- Step, step.

1636
00:56:40,626 --> 00:56:42,326
- Yes.
- Step, step.

1637
00:56:42,366 --> 00:56:43,465
(They're doing well.)

1638
00:56:43,466 --> 00:56:45,095
Okay. Let's move on to the hands.

1639
00:56:45,096 --> 00:56:46,335
- I would've gotten fired.
- Okay.

1640
00:56:46,336 --> 00:56:49,605
The fist goes behind the head and comes back.

1641
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:52,076
- It goes behind the head...
- Back, front.

1642
00:56:52,576 --> 00:56:55,175
Afterward, throw this hand.

1643
00:56:55,176 --> 00:56:56,746
- "Meeting." - "Meeting."

1644
00:56:57,046 --> 00:56:58,115
"Meeting."

1645
00:56:58,116 --> 00:56:59,915
- Bend...
- Are we doing this with the feet?

1646
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:00,986
And unbend.

1647
00:57:01,446 --> 00:57:02,616
All right.

1648
00:57:03,616 --> 00:57:06,586
(What happens when you combine the arm and leg movements?)

1649
00:57:07,526 --> 00:57:10,655
(Flailing)

1650
00:57:10,656 --> 00:57:11,825
(They can only laugh.)

1651
00:57:11,826 --> 00:57:12,926
Is there a reason...

1652
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:15,396
why the four limbs are moving separately?

1653
00:57:15,566 --> 00:57:16,666
Lia.

1654
00:57:16,726 --> 00:57:18,712
Do you want us to combine the arm and leg movements?

1655
00:57:18,736 --> 00:57:19,766
Yes.

1656
00:57:20,536 --> 00:57:22,966
It's like this exercise.

1657
00:57:23,066 --> 00:57:25,012
It's like the difficult version of this exercise.

1658
00:57:25,036 --> 00:57:27,075
You just need to get past this part.

1659
00:57:27,076 --> 00:57:29,236
- It's the hardest part.
- Yes, it's the hardest part.

1660
00:57:29,546 --> 00:57:30,876
I keep malfunctioning.

1661
00:57:31,816 --> 00:57:35,585
(Seung Ho finds the footwork very hard.)

1662
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:37,555
- That's right.
- What do I do afterward?

1663
00:57:37,556 --> 00:57:40,115
From here, go out...

1664
00:57:40,116 --> 00:57:41,185
(Thus began Seung Ho's private lesson.)

1665
00:57:41,186 --> 00:57:42,726
and come back inside.

1666
00:57:43,456 --> 00:57:44,626
Kick, kick.

1667
00:57:45,956 --> 00:57:47,366
(My goodness)

1668
00:57:47,866 --> 00:57:50,295
Kick, kick.

1669
00:57:50,296 --> 00:57:52,596
Yes. When you kick...

1670
00:57:52,766 --> 00:57:56,935
(Working hard)

1671
00:57:56,936 --> 00:58:01,776
(Despite the repetition, the part continues to be hard.)

1672
00:58:02,406 --> 00:58:04,445
(Depressed)

1673
00:58:04,446 --> 00:58:05,915
(Staring intently)

1674
00:58:05,916 --> 00:58:07,246
Come back inside.

1675
00:58:07,486 --> 00:58:10,216
Go out and come back inside. Front, back.

1676
00:58:10,856 --> 00:58:12,455
- Actually, - Why aren't you doing anything?

1677
00:58:12,456 --> 00:58:14,226
- my head turned blank.
- Are you okay?

1678
00:58:14,556 --> 00:58:16,385
(He renews his resolution for the air conditioner.)

1679
00:58:16,386 --> 00:58:17,425
From here...

1680
00:58:17,426 --> 00:58:19,625
Let's go. You can do it.

1681
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:20,626
(You can do it.)

1682
00:58:20,826 --> 00:58:24,966
(If it's hard, practice until you can do it right.)

1683
00:58:25,496 --> 00:58:27,505
(The ones who do pretty well are Tae Hyun, )

1684
00:58:27,506 --> 00:58:29,965
(Yi Kyung, and Sang Uk.)

1685
00:58:29,966 --> 00:58:31,006
To the back.

1686
00:58:31,676 --> 00:58:34,606
(Dong Hyun does his best despite looking clumsy.)

1687
00:58:35,576 --> 00:58:40,486
(And Seung Ho practices by himself.)

1688
00:58:41,186 --> 00:58:43,545
(Silent)

1689
00:58:43,546 --> 00:58:44,616
Okay.

1690
00:58:45,016 --> 00:58:46,985
They're focusing on practicing without a word.

1691
00:58:46,986 --> 00:58:48,325
Yes. They're absorbed.

1692
00:58:48,326 --> 00:58:50,155
Totally. They're totally focused.

1693
00:58:50,156 --> 00:58:52,325
(Moved)

1694
00:58:52,326 --> 00:58:53,926
- Twenty minutes remain.
- Okay.

1695
00:58:54,726 --> 00:58:57,866
(Not much time remains.)

1696
00:58:58,696 --> 00:59:00,905
(They practice...)

1697
00:59:00,906 --> 00:59:02,805
(and practice.)

1698
00:59:02,806 --> 00:59:04,135
It's so hard.

1699
00:59:04,136 --> 00:59:06,276
And one. Do it quickly.

1700
00:59:07,276 --> 00:59:08,346
That's it!

1701
00:59:08,476 --> 00:59:09,645
(To use the air conditioner for 1 hour)

1702
00:59:09,646 --> 00:59:10,675
Spread out.

1703
00:59:10,676 --> 00:59:12,476
(To use the air conditioner for 1 hour)

1704
00:59:12,816 --> 00:59:14,385
I think you guys will succeed in it.

1705
00:59:14,386 --> 00:59:15,745
- All right.
- You got this.

1706
00:59:15,746 --> 00:59:16,885
(Will Handsome Guys succeed in the mission?)

1707
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,815
Let's put an end to this long fight.

1708
00:59:18,816 --> 00:59:19,855
Okay.

1709
00:59:19,856 --> 00:59:21,755
- We need to smile. We're idols.
- Let's shout, "Here we go."

1710
00:59:21,756 --> 00:59:22,785
We need to smile.

1711
00:59:22,786 --> 00:59:24,026
Smile. We're idols.

1712
00:59:24,656 --> 00:59:25,656
Let's do a cheer.

1713
00:59:25,657 --> 00:59:27,525
- Do we need to smile?
- Come on. Let's do a cheer.

1714
00:59:27,526 --> 00:59:28,795
- Let's go.
- All right.

1715
00:59:28,796 --> 00:59:29,925
Let's finish it in one go.

1716
00:59:29,926 --> 00:59:31,035
- Let's use the air conditioner.
- The air conditioner.

1717
00:59:31,036 --> 00:59:32,235
TWS, let's go!

1718
00:59:32,236 --> 00:59:34,206
- TWS, let's go!
- Let's go!

1719
00:59:34,636 --> 00:59:36,865
(Handsome Guys, let's go!)

1720
00:59:36,866 --> 00:59:37,975
- Here we go.
- TWS.

1721
00:59:37,976 --> 00:59:38,976
- Here we go.
- Good luck.

1722
00:59:38,977 --> 00:59:40,305
- Let's go.
- Here we go.

1723
00:59:40,306 --> 00:59:41,445
(They'll do the challenge to use the air conditioner for 1 hour!)

1724
00:59:41,446 --> 00:59:42,575
- Let's begin.
- Okay.

1725
00:59:42,576 --> 00:59:46,076
(Even the slightest mistake won't be tolerated.)

1726
00:59:46,546 --> 00:59:49,516
(It's a nerve-racking moment.)

1727
00:59:54,556 --> 00:59:58,355
(The first meeting is too hard)

1728
00:59:58,356 --> 01:00:02,265
(The perfect dancers perform smoothly.)

1729
01:00:02,266 --> 01:00:06,966
(Nothing goes according to plan)

1730
01:00:09,336 --> 01:00:11,205
(Even Dong Hyun does the part correctly.)

1731
01:00:11,206 --> 01:00:13,876
(The first meeting is too hard)

1732
01:00:14,476 --> 01:00:16,076
(Giggling)

1733
01:00:19,276 --> 01:00:22,746
(Seung Ho's dance looks a bit off.)

1734
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:26,186
(They still do the mission until the very end.)

1735
01:00:27,126 --> 01:00:30,726
(The ending fairy)

1736
01:00:30,796 --> 01:00:31,895
Was it similar?

1737
01:00:31,896 --> 01:00:35,125
(Will they be able to get a pass?)

1738
01:00:35,126 --> 01:00:36,226
Was it similar?

1739
01:00:37,096 --> 01:00:38,236
How was it?

1740
01:00:38,496 --> 01:00:39,596
I mean...

1741
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:41,935
(Well...)

1742
01:00:41,936 --> 01:00:43,005
Let's start over.

1743
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:44,475
- Let's do it.
- Play the song again.

1744
01:00:44,476 --> 01:00:45,635
What's wrong?

1745
01:00:45,636 --> 01:00:46,636
Why?

1746
01:00:46,637 --> 01:00:47,976
Was there a problem?

1747
01:00:48,076 --> 01:00:49,105
What?

1748
01:00:49,106 --> 01:00:50,722
- What?
- We should've done a run-through.

1749
01:00:50,746 --> 01:00:53,616
(She hesitates to say what's wrong.)

1750
01:00:53,716 --> 01:00:54,745
Who was it?

1751
01:00:54,746 --> 01:00:56,246
Which punk made a mistake?

1752
01:00:56,746 --> 01:00:58,315
Lia, we'll throw him in the water.

1753
01:00:58,316 --> 01:00:59,416
I know who it is.

1754
01:00:59,586 --> 01:01:01,785
- I know who it is.
- We'll do the water torture.

1755
01:01:01,786 --> 01:01:03,226
- I'll go into the water.
- No!

1756
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,326
No!

1757
01:01:04,726 --> 01:01:06,095
We're a team.

1758
01:01:06,096 --> 01:01:07,926
(I'm sorry.)

1759
01:01:08,296 --> 01:01:09,995
- It was Seung Ho.
- Okay.

1760
01:01:09,996 --> 01:01:11,265
- What did he do?
- For this move,

1761
01:01:11,266 --> 01:01:13,266
- his beat was off.
- Did he go too fast?

1762
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:18,536
(Seung Ho missed a beat.)

1763
01:01:18,706 --> 01:01:20,182
- Did he go too fast?
- In that case, we'll try again.

1764
01:01:20,206 --> 01:01:21,275
- We'll try again.
- He was a bit late.

1765
01:01:21,276 --> 01:01:22,845
- It was a bad take.
- Let's try again.

1766
01:01:22,846 --> 01:01:25,075
That's right. Give us another chance.

1767
01:01:25,076 --> 01:01:26,945
You failed to succeed in the mission...

1768
01:01:26,946 --> 01:01:28,346
- for one hour.
- My goodness.

1769
01:01:28,746 --> 01:01:30,115
We'll give you a chance...

1770
01:01:30,116 --> 01:01:31,185
- for 30 minutes.
- Okay.

1771
01:01:31,186 --> 01:01:32,256
Give us a chance.

1772
01:01:32,286 --> 01:01:34,462
(Another attempt for 30 minutes of the air conditioner)

1773
01:01:34,486 --> 01:01:35,555
Get up.

1774
01:01:35,556 --> 01:01:37,085
- Okay.
- Go at eight.

1775
01:01:37,086 --> 01:01:40,355
(Seung Ho practices desperately before doing the last challenge.)

1776
01:01:40,356 --> 01:01:42,825
(Heave-ho)

1777
01:01:42,826 --> 01:01:43,835
Seung Ho, come here.

1778
01:01:43,836 --> 01:01:44,995
Let's shout Lia's name.

1779
01:01:44,996 --> 01:01:46,136
"Lia Kim, let's go."

1780
01:01:46,236 --> 01:01:49,836
- Lia Kim, let's go!
- Let's go!

1781
01:01:50,366 --> 01:01:52,436
- Lia Kim!
- Okay!

1782
01:01:52,476 --> 01:01:53,505
Good luck.

1783
01:01:53,506 --> 01:01:55,476
(Good luck.)

1784
01:01:56,346 --> 01:01:57,546
Let's begin.

1785
01:01:57,946 --> 01:02:01,546
(Let's not waste 1 hour of sweat.)

1786
01:02:02,346 --> 01:02:07,016
(Will Handsome Guys see the fruit of their hard work?)

1787
01:02:08,386 --> 01:02:10,556
(You can do it.)

1788
01:02:12,556 --> 01:02:13,596
Two.

1789
01:02:15,696 --> 01:02:19,795
(The first meeting is too hard)

1790
01:02:19,796 --> 01:02:22,706
(Nothing goes according to plan)

1791
01:02:23,166 --> 01:02:28,106
(Here comes the problematic part.)

1792
01:02:28,806 --> 01:02:29,806
(Showing a big smile)

1793
01:02:29,807 --> 01:02:31,815
That's it. That's good.

1794
01:02:31,816 --> 01:02:33,376
(Smiling)

1795
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:38,286
(Handsome Guys' challenge nears its end.)

1796
01:02:39,056 --> 01:02:40,086
Come on!

1797
01:02:40,216 --> 01:02:43,185
(The ending stab)

1798
01:02:43,186 --> 01:02:47,225
(Will Handsome Guys get 30 minutes of air conditioner usage?)

1799
01:02:47,226 --> 01:02:49,626
(Nervous)

1800
01:02:50,026 --> 01:02:51,135
(Cheering)

1801
01:02:51,136 --> 01:02:52,365
It's a success.

1802
01:02:52,366 --> 01:02:54,505
(Of course, it's a success.)

1803
01:02:54,506 --> 01:02:55,735
- It's a success.
- It's a success.

1804
01:02:55,736 --> 01:02:56,805
Okay.

1805
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:59,076
(Handsome Guys get 30 minutes of air conditioner usage.)

1806
01:02:59,836 --> 01:03:01,545
- Well done.
- It's definitely a success.

1807
01:03:01,546 --> 01:03:02,675
- You guys...
- I'm exhausted.

1808
01:03:02,676 --> 01:03:03,945
- worked very hard.
- Thank you.

1809
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,045
- Seriously.
- Thank you for your hard work.

1810
01:03:05,046 --> 01:03:06,415
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

1811
01:03:06,416 --> 01:03:07,715
Let's throw Lia up in the air.

1812
01:03:07,716 --> 01:03:08,886
What?

1813
01:03:09,386 --> 01:03:11,755
- What?
- One...

1814
01:03:11,756 --> 01:03:13,315
One, two, three.

1815
01:03:13,316 --> 01:03:14,555
(Hurrah for the best choreographer, Lia Kim.)

1816
01:03:14,556 --> 01:03:15,836
- One, two...
- She's too light.

1817
01:03:16,056 --> 01:03:17,256
She's light.

1818
01:03:17,356 --> 01:03:18,955
- She's too light.
- She's too light.

1819
01:03:18,956 --> 01:03:20,526
- Lia is light.
- You know...

1820
01:03:21,066 --> 01:03:22,896
- Seriously, - You know...

1821
01:03:22,966 --> 01:03:24,966
I was moved to see you guy practice so hard.

1822
01:03:25,066 --> 01:03:26,666
You guys were cool.

1823
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:29,212
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

1824
01:03:29,236 --> 01:03:30,265
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Lia.

1825
01:03:30,266 --> 01:03:32,205
- Thanks to you, Lia, - Thank you for your hard work.

1826
01:03:32,206 --> 01:03:33,875
We could do as much as TWS' toenails.

1827
01:03:33,876 --> 01:03:35,246
- You guys did very well.
- Now,

1828
01:03:35,346 --> 01:03:36,405
we'll dance if we hear this song...

1829
01:03:36,406 --> 01:03:37,615
- on the street.
- We'll definitely dance.

1830
01:03:37,616 --> 01:03:39,315
We'll definitely dance.

1831
01:03:39,316 --> 01:03:40,346
We'll definitely dance.

1832
01:03:40,846 --> 01:03:42,115
Thank you for your hard work.

1833
01:03:42,116 --> 01:03:44,015
- I hope it wasn't too strenuous.
- No.

1834
01:03:44,016 --> 01:03:45,415
- No.
- Of course not.

1835
01:03:45,416 --> 01:03:46,815
I hope it wasn't like that.

1836
01:03:46,816 --> 01:03:47,855
Have a safe trip home.

1837
01:03:47,856 --> 01:03:49,355
Thank you for your hard work.

1838
01:03:49,356 --> 01:03:51,225
- Thank you.
- Enjoy the meal.

1839
01:03:51,226 --> 01:03:52,355
Thank you.

1840
01:03:52,356 --> 01:03:54,065
I can't believe she came all the way here.

1841
01:03:54,066 --> 01:03:55,295
She's not someone who should be here.

1842
01:03:55,296 --> 01:03:56,596
I know.

1843
01:03:56,726 --> 01:03:58,765
Why did you guys invite such an expensive instructor?

1844
01:03:58,766 --> 01:04:00,266
They invited a total expert.

1845
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:01,506
I'm exhausted.

1846
01:04:01,566 --> 01:04:02,635
My clothes are soaked.

1847
01:04:02,636 --> 01:04:05,036
(You guys did well.)

1848
01:04:08,476 --> 01:04:09,575
I'm exhausted.

1849
01:04:09,576 --> 01:04:10,576
(They turn on the air conditioner.)

1850
01:04:10,577 --> 01:04:12,076
The air conditioner.

1851
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:15,046
It's nice.

1852
01:04:15,446 --> 01:04:17,016
It's nice.

1853
01:04:18,216 --> 01:04:19,316
I'm exhausted.

1854
01:04:20,486 --> 01:04:21,886
- I used up my energy.
- It was...

1855
01:04:22,326 --> 01:04:23,526
an exercise.

1856
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:25,255
I got my day's worth of exercise.

1857
01:04:25,256 --> 01:04:26,732
(They got their day's worth of exercise.)

1858
01:04:26,756 --> 01:04:27,825
I walked over 12,000 steps today.

1859
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:30,766
(Seung Ho checks the temperature as soon as he enters.)

1860
01:04:31,066 --> 01:04:35,336
(Turbo mode at full power)

1861
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:38,835
(Tae Hyun takes the lead.)

1862
01:04:38,836 --> 01:04:40,376
It was over 12,000 steps.

1863
01:04:42,506 --> 01:04:47,386
(The members begin to lie down one at a time.)

1864
01:04:48,586 --> 01:04:52,216
(Thanks to the cool wind from the air conditioner, )

1865
01:04:52,556 --> 01:04:56,855
(they're one step further from the heat...)

1866
01:04:56,856 --> 01:05:01,226
(and one step closer to relaxation.)

1867
01:05:02,466 --> 01:05:05,866
(Sang Uk joins them after taking a shower.)

1868
01:05:06,866 --> 01:05:09,736
(He lies down with a bag of snacks.)

1869
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:13,536
(Seung Ho takes out ice cream.)

1870
01:05:14,706 --> 01:05:20,416
(They enjoy the sweet rest in their own way.)

1871
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:26,555
I'm so drowsy.

1872
01:05:26,556 --> 01:05:27,732
(The promised 30 minutes ended.)

1873
01:05:27,756 --> 01:05:31,426
(The air conditioner gets turned off.)

1874
01:05:33,456 --> 01:05:34,726
(What?)

1875
01:05:34,796 --> 01:05:35,866
It's over.

1876
01:05:36,396 --> 01:05:38,835
(They don't get more time with the air conditioner.)

1877
01:05:38,836 --> 01:05:40,272
How did it get turned off automatically?

1878
01:05:40,296 --> 01:05:41,306
I guess...

1879
01:05:41,436 --> 01:05:43,306
I guess someone controlled it from a distance.

1880
01:05:44,336 --> 01:05:45,375
(30 minutes were too short.)

1881
01:05:45,376 --> 01:05:47,506
Learning the dance was so hard.

1882
01:05:48,706 --> 01:05:50,105
It's hot.

1883
01:05:50,106 --> 01:05:52,076
(The heat comes back.)

1884
01:05:52,216 --> 01:05:54,816
(Current time: 5pm)

1885
01:05:55,546 --> 01:05:56,786
That's how it is.

1886
01:05:57,016 --> 01:05:58,685
You don't know what's...

1887
01:05:58,686 --> 01:06:00,356
- Did you get some rest?
- Yes.

1888
01:06:00,986 --> 01:06:02,426
- Yes.
- Yes.

1889
01:06:02,986 --> 01:06:04,925
- The air conditioner is turned off.
- Yes.

1890
01:06:04,926 --> 01:06:06,595
How did you turn it off?

1891
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:07,865
I guess there was a timer.

1892
01:06:07,866 --> 01:06:09,526
The production crew is something else.

1893
01:06:09,696 --> 01:06:10,696
I'm here...

1894
01:06:10,697 --> 01:06:12,995
to give you another chance to use the air conditioner.

1895
01:06:12,996 --> 01:06:14,365
- The air conditioner?
- Yes.

1896
01:06:14,366 --> 01:06:16,265
We prepared a small opportunity.

1897
01:06:16,266 --> 01:06:17,666
- Really? What is it?
- What is it?

1898
01:06:18,306 --> 01:06:20,406
(The second chance to use the air conditioner)

1899
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:23,076
You'll get a quiz.

1900
01:06:24,316 --> 01:06:26,146
One person who answers correctly...

1901
01:06:26,716 --> 01:06:29,516
can turn on the air conditioner at full power in the bedroom.

1902
01:06:29,816 --> 01:06:32,285
He can use the air conditioner freely in the room.

1903
01:06:32,286 --> 01:06:33,806
- Will it be like the ice room?
- Yes.

1904
01:06:33,916 --> 01:06:35,355
Saunas have an ice room.

1905
01:06:35,356 --> 01:06:36,526
It'll be amazing.

1906
01:06:37,756 --> 01:06:39,825
Gosh, what's this?

1907
01:06:39,826 --> 01:06:40,865
(They come out to the living room to seize the air conditioner.)

1908
01:06:40,866 --> 01:06:43,066
We'll need to go all the way there.

1909
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:44,765
- I think we need to go there.
- Is that it?

1910
01:06:44,766 --> 01:06:46,096
There's a line.

1911
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:47,966
- My goodness.
- Isn't it hard...

1912
01:06:48,006 --> 01:06:49,706
to race in this hallway?

1913
01:06:50,036 --> 01:06:51,305
After the question,

1914
01:06:51,306 --> 01:06:53,376
you'll hear the starting signal.

1915
01:06:53,436 --> 01:06:54,916
Then you'll do the seat cushion race.

1916
01:06:55,046 --> 01:06:56,605
The first person to arrive...

1917
01:06:56,606 --> 01:06:58,776
will get a chance to answer the question.

1918
01:06:59,616 --> 01:07:00,785
Come to think of it,

1919
01:07:00,786 --> 01:07:02,885
you can't go unless you know the answer.

1920
01:07:02,886 --> 01:07:04,315
- You need to answer correctly.
- Going isn't the problem.

1921
01:07:04,316 --> 01:07:06,355
- If you don't know, you can stay.
- Then there's no reason to go.

1922
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,286
If you don't know, you can't go, Seung Ho.

1923
01:07:08,656 --> 01:07:10,832
- Then I'll watch from here.
- You'll just get exhausted.

1924
01:07:10,856 --> 01:07:12,496
All right. Here comes the question.

1925
01:07:13,126 --> 01:07:15,195
The air conditioner as we know it...

1926
01:07:15,196 --> 01:07:18,835
wasn't an invention for people.

1927
01:07:18,836 --> 01:07:19,866
- Really?
- Really?

1928
01:07:20,496 --> 01:07:22,135
In 1902,

1929
01:07:22,136 --> 01:07:25,935
an engineer in the US wanted to fix the problem...

1930
01:07:25,936 --> 01:07:29,075
of "Blank" becoming wrinkly due to the humidity in summer.

1931
01:07:29,076 --> 01:07:31,776
That was why he invented the modern-day air conditioner.

1932
01:07:31,916 --> 01:07:33,976
What goes in the blank?

1933
01:07:34,446 --> 01:07:36,515
"Blank" became wrinkly due to the humidity in summer.

1934
01:07:36,516 --> 01:07:38,056
This is too hard.

1935
01:07:38,856 --> 01:07:39,856
We...

1936
01:07:39,857 --> 01:07:42,255
(The starting signal sounds.)

1937
01:07:42,256 --> 01:07:43,955
- Shouldn't we go?
- Why?

1938
01:07:43,956 --> 01:07:45,026
- I don't know.
- I'll go.

1939
01:07:45,156 --> 01:07:47,666
(The seat cushion race begins.)

1940
01:07:48,196 --> 01:07:50,836
(Heave-ho)

1941
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:55,136
Why can't I move forward?

1942
01:07:55,636 --> 01:07:57,436
I can't move forward! Hey!

1943
01:07:58,976 --> 01:08:00,705
(The race is neck-and-neck.)

1944
01:08:00,706 --> 01:08:02,476
No!

1945
01:08:03,106 --> 01:08:04,826
- They'll get sweaty.
- They'll get sweaty.

1946
01:08:05,476 --> 01:08:06,515
Right now...

1947
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:07,715
Why would they go if they don't know the answer?

1948
01:08:07,716 --> 01:08:08,916
It isn't hot.

1949
01:08:10,886 --> 01:08:12,055
Look at him.

1950
01:08:12,056 --> 01:08:13,892
- Why aren't those two coming?
- I don't know.

1951
01:08:13,916 --> 01:08:15,285
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

1952
01:08:15,286 --> 01:08:16,356
(Let me answer!)

1953
01:08:17,356 --> 01:08:18,456
Clothes.

1954
01:08:18,496 --> 01:08:20,626
Come on. There's no way that's correct.

1955
01:08:20,656 --> 01:08:21,825
Incorrect.

1956
01:08:21,826 --> 01:08:23,026
For goodness' sake.

1957
01:08:23,096 --> 01:08:24,365
(If you go without knowing the answer, you'll just get hot.)

1958
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:26,265
I don't know the answer.

1959
01:08:26,266 --> 01:08:27,366
You don't know the answer.

1960
01:08:27,706 --> 01:08:30,505
(How about Seung Ho?)

1961
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:32,676
- Was it 1902?
- Yes, it was 1902.

1962
01:08:32,906 --> 01:08:34,275
Carrier invented it.

1963
01:08:34,276 --> 01:08:35,575
You're correct.

1964
01:08:35,576 --> 01:08:36,945
Carrier invented it.

1965
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,645
- Who invented it?
- Did a carrier invent it?

1966
01:08:38,646 --> 01:08:39,946
Carrier is a name.

1967
01:08:40,676 --> 01:08:41,786
Let me answer.

1968
01:08:43,446 --> 01:08:45,155
- Paper.
- Paper.

1969
01:08:45,156 --> 01:08:46,886
(Answer: Paper)

1970
01:08:48,756 --> 01:08:49,886
Paper.

1971
01:08:50,586 --> 01:08:51,695
Correct.

1972
01:08:51,696 --> 01:08:53,125
(Answer: Paper)

1973
01:08:53,126 --> 01:08:55,042
- Seung Ho is good.
- Seung Ho is knowledgeable.

1974
01:08:55,066 --> 01:08:56,696
Seung Ho is good.

1975
01:08:57,366 --> 01:08:59,995
(Dejected)

1976
01:08:59,996 --> 01:09:01,265
Why paper?

1977
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:03,365
Every summer, ink got smudged...

1978
01:09:03,366 --> 01:09:04,475
and ruined the prints...

1979
01:09:04,476 --> 01:09:06,735
due to the intense humidity.

1980
01:09:06,736 --> 01:09:10,105
So people asked to invent a machine that controlled the humidity.

1981
01:09:10,106 --> 01:09:12,446
This machine became the first air conditioner.

1982
01:09:13,276 --> 01:09:17,386
(This is technology!)

1983
01:09:18,186 --> 01:09:21,126
(Meanwhile, Seung Ho, the one who answered correctly)

1984
01:09:21,956 --> 01:09:23,125
He's taking a bag of snacks.

1985
01:09:23,126 --> 01:09:24,206
(He takes a bag of snacks.)

1986
01:09:24,756 --> 01:09:26,195
(Bye, everyone.)

1987
01:09:26,196 --> 01:09:27,596
Shout and let us know how it is.

1988
01:09:28,226 --> 01:09:32,566
(Full of fresh and cool air)

1989
01:09:33,266 --> 01:09:35,906
(He enters the air-conditioned room.)

1990
01:09:37,466 --> 01:09:41,146
(He turns on the turbo mode!)

1991
01:09:42,106 --> 01:09:45,476
(Very jealous)

1992
01:09:45,576 --> 01:09:47,445
You should think before going there.

1993
01:09:47,446 --> 01:09:48,645
- It gets incredibly hot.
- Exactly.

1994
01:09:48,646 --> 01:09:50,122
- I went once, right?
- My body turned hot.

1995
01:09:50,146 --> 01:09:51,755
I began sweating from here.

1996
01:09:51,756 --> 01:09:54,326
(Life in Shortage makes them suffer the lack of civilization.)

1997
01:09:54,556 --> 01:09:57,355
This spot isn't even hot.

1998
01:09:57,356 --> 01:09:58,456
It's just right.

1999
01:09:59,726 --> 01:10:03,126
(I'm sitting by the window.)

2000
01:10:04,126 --> 01:10:05,595
It's just right. This spot is great.

2001
01:10:05,596 --> 01:10:08,966
(It's pretty cool thank to the breeze.)

2002
01:10:09,506 --> 01:10:09,938
(Peeking)

2003
01:10:10,412 --> 01:10:11,511
(Peeking)

2004
01:10:11,512 --> 01:10:15,012
The room wasn't cool, so I changed the mode to air conditioning.

2005
01:10:15,782 --> 01:10:17,051
It wasn't in the air conditioning mode.

2006
01:10:17,052 --> 01:10:18,321
For goodness' sake.

2007
01:10:18,322 --> 01:10:19,322
It was in the dehumidification mode.

2008
01:10:19,322 --> 01:10:20,322
Production crew, come on.

2009
01:10:20,722 --> 01:10:21,792
Seriously.

2010
01:10:22,322 --> 01:10:24,461
- Let's do better, okay?
- Okay. We're sorry.

2011
01:10:24,462 --> 01:10:26,691
- "Let's do better." - We apologize.

2012
01:10:26,692 --> 01:10:28,461
- Thank you.
- Okay. We apologize.

2013
01:10:28,462 --> 01:10:30,962
(They wrap up on a heartwarming note.)

2014
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:37,202
(Seung Ho enjoys air conditioning.)

2015
01:10:37,402 --> 01:10:38,672
Here comes a question.

2016
01:10:39,102 --> 01:10:41,741
There's a North Korean expression, "Calf comrade."

2017
01:10:41,742 --> 01:10:43,041
What does "Calf comrade" mean?

2018
01:10:43,042 --> 01:10:45,381
What's the South Korean equivalent of this expression?

2019
01:10:45,382 --> 01:10:46,942
I'm doing this because my knees hurt.

2020
01:10:47,752 --> 01:10:50,081
- Calf comrade.
- My knees hurt.

2021
01:10:50,082 --> 01:10:51,951
- Tae Hyun, what are you doing?
- Wait for the signal.

2022
01:10:51,952 --> 01:10:53,522
Wait for the signal.

2023
01:10:53,882 --> 01:10:54,892
Go.

2024
01:10:55,752 --> 01:10:58,491
- How is he so fast?
- How is he so fast?

2025
01:10:58,492 --> 01:10:59,722
I can't believe him.

2026
01:10:59,962 --> 01:11:03,961
(He's human Larva.)

2027
01:11:03,962 --> 01:11:05,702
- It's okay to move this way, right?
- Yes.

2028
01:11:06,062 --> 01:11:08,731
(They weren't told to move on their bottoms.)

2029
01:11:08,732 --> 01:11:09,902
I should do this too.

2030
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:12,372
- I'll get in line. You never know.
- This is nice.

2031
01:11:13,402 --> 01:11:14,911
I don't know if I can say this on TV.

2032
01:11:14,912 --> 01:11:17,111
- I have the answer.
- Go ahead and say it.

2033
01:11:17,112 --> 01:11:18,182
- Can I say it?
- Yes.

2034
01:11:18,682 --> 01:11:19,812
Homie.

2035
01:11:20,812 --> 01:11:21,852
Incorrect.

2036
01:11:21,982 --> 01:11:24,251
For goodness' sake. I know that it's correct.

2037
01:11:24,252 --> 01:11:25,652
- Go back.
- It's incorrect.

2038
01:11:26,352 --> 01:11:28,092
There's the exact equivalent.

2039
01:11:28,522 --> 01:11:30,692
Alumnus.

2040
01:11:31,492 --> 01:11:32,522
Incorrect.

2041
01:11:32,892 --> 01:11:34,062
Hurry up and come here.

2042
01:11:34,122 --> 01:11:35,292
Do you know the answer?

2043
01:11:35,432 --> 01:11:36,732
Not really.

2044
01:11:37,902 --> 01:11:39,561
I came without knowing the answer.

2045
01:11:39,562 --> 01:11:40,732
(I just followed everyone.)

2046
01:11:40,932 --> 01:11:44,472
(This member is the most comfortable.)

2047
01:11:45,572 --> 01:11:47,301
Can I line up again?

2048
01:11:47,302 --> 01:11:49,511
- Yes, you can.
- For another chance,

2049
01:11:49,512 --> 01:11:51,681
do I need to race down the hall again?

2050
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:52,682
(Start over from the starting line for another attempt.)

2051
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:55,081
- Calf comrade.
- Calf comrade.

2052
01:11:55,082 --> 01:11:56,681
(Tae Hyun gives it a go.)

2053
01:11:56,682 --> 01:11:58,552
- Childhood friend.
- Childhood friend.

2054
01:11:59,082 --> 01:12:00,121
Correct.

2055
01:12:00,122 --> 01:12:01,162
(Answer: Childhood friend)

2056
01:12:02,892 --> 01:12:03,892
Correct.

2057
01:12:03,893 --> 01:12:06,721
(Dejected)

2058
01:12:06,722 --> 01:12:10,592
(Dispirited)

2059
01:12:10,992 --> 01:12:12,132
Come on out.

2060
01:12:12,832 --> 01:12:14,702
- Come on out.
- It's so cool.

2061
01:12:15,472 --> 01:12:18,372
(The spot gets affected by the air conditioner.)

2062
01:12:18,642 --> 01:12:20,572
(They switch places.)

2063
01:12:21,512 --> 01:12:22,872
How could you not know the answer?

2064
01:12:23,912 --> 01:12:26,411
- Tae Hyun, don't touch the remote.
- Okay.

2065
01:12:26,412 --> 01:12:28,282
- Lie down on the exact spot.
- Okay.

2066
01:12:29,882 --> 01:12:31,182
It's cool in here.

2067
01:12:32,722 --> 01:12:37,392
(This is the taste of civilization.)

2068
01:12:39,392 --> 01:12:41,292
I think I'm really bad at quizzes.

2069
01:12:41,962 --> 01:12:44,092
This is bad. It's hot. I'm sweating so much.

2070
01:12:44,902 --> 01:12:46,662
- This is bad.
- This is bad.

2071
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:48,531
What should I do? I'm sweating so much.

2072
01:12:48,532 --> 01:12:50,002
(Sticky)

2073
01:12:50,832 --> 01:12:51,871
Let's hurry.

2074
01:12:51,872 --> 01:12:52,872
- Let's resume.
- We need to hurry.

2075
01:12:52,873 --> 01:12:53,942
Okay.

2076
01:12:54,842 --> 01:12:56,211
(Determined)

2077
01:12:56,212 --> 01:12:59,181
In the US, a powder that was made...

2078
01:12:59,182 --> 01:13:02,312
of pig's "Blank" was sprinkled on a cut finger.

2079
01:13:02,452 --> 01:13:04,881
Four weeks later, the finger grew up...

2080
01:13:04,882 --> 01:13:07,051
with the fingernail.

2081
01:13:07,052 --> 01:13:08,491
What goes in the blank?

2082
01:13:08,492 --> 01:13:09,991
- Do you know?
- I'm going to guess.

2083
01:13:09,992 --> 01:13:11,122
I don't have a clue.

2084
01:13:11,862 --> 01:13:12,921
(Dong Hyun sets off.)

2085
01:13:12,922 --> 01:13:15,562
- The signal didn't sound.
- That's right.

2086
01:13:15,862 --> 01:13:18,008
- The signal didn't sound.
- The signal didn't sound. It's hot.

2087
01:13:18,032 --> 01:13:19,792
I can't think straight because it's too hot.

2088
01:13:19,902 --> 01:13:22,131
- The signal didn't sound.
- Is everyone going that way?

2089
01:13:22,132 --> 01:13:23,372
(They use their knees.)

2090
01:13:24,032 --> 01:13:25,642
(Falling down)

2091
01:13:26,942 --> 01:13:30,312
(Seung Ho gets a fast start!)

2092
01:13:30,412 --> 01:13:32,582
(Let's block him.)

2093
01:13:33,482 --> 01:13:34,552
He's too fast.

2094
01:13:34,852 --> 01:13:38,821
(Paradise versus Netherworld)

2095
01:13:38,822 --> 01:13:39,922
He's too fast.

2096
01:13:40,052 --> 01:13:41,421
My knees hurt.

2097
01:13:41,422 --> 01:13:42,791
This is the worst.

2098
01:13:42,792 --> 01:13:43,928
(The netherworld is full of their groans.)

2099
01:13:43,952 --> 01:13:45,292
Please don't answer correctly.

2100
01:13:46,122 --> 01:13:47,222
What's the answer?

2101
01:13:47,762 --> 01:13:48,892
Rind.

2102
01:13:49,032 --> 01:13:50,362
- That makes sense.
- No.

2103
01:13:50,962 --> 01:13:51,962
- Collagen?
- Incorrect.

2104
01:13:51,963 --> 01:13:53,131
Okay. Move out of the way.

2105
01:13:53,132 --> 01:13:54,132
It's this one.

2106
01:13:54,402 --> 01:13:56,032
I have a hunch.

2107
01:13:56,332 --> 01:13:57,402
Tail.

2108
01:13:57,432 --> 01:13:59,572
- Tail.
- Isn't it restorative?

2109
01:13:59,702 --> 01:14:00,702
Incorrect.

2110
01:14:01,742 --> 01:14:03,241
- For goodness' sake.
- I'll get this one right.

2111
01:14:03,242 --> 01:14:04,242
(Making a U-turn)

2112
01:14:04,243 --> 01:14:07,781
- I have a story.
- Okay.

2113
01:14:07,782 --> 01:14:09,951
I had surgery on my gums,

2114
01:14:09,952 --> 01:14:11,582
and the dentist told me this.

2115
01:14:11,922 --> 01:14:13,851
- Pig's skin.
- Pig's skin.

2116
01:14:13,852 --> 01:14:15,151
Apparently, you can transplant pig's skin...

2117
01:14:15,152 --> 01:14:16,321
and it'll lead to engraftment.

2118
01:14:16,322 --> 01:14:17,392
- Incorrect.
- Incorrect.

2119
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:20,422
- What?
- I think it's an organ.

2120
01:14:22,632 --> 01:14:24,392
- Stomach.
- Stomach.

2121
01:14:25,232 --> 01:14:26,901
- Incorrect.
- Move out of the way.

2122
01:14:26,902 --> 01:14:28,422
Move out of the way. Stomach, my foot.

2123
01:14:28,902 --> 01:14:31,472
Sang Uk, you should just stay behind the starting line.

2124
01:14:32,702 --> 01:14:35,012
(Sad)

2125
01:14:35,272 --> 01:14:36,542
It's hot.

2126
01:14:36,912 --> 01:14:38,012
It's no joke.

2127
01:14:38,712 --> 01:14:41,042
(Sweating)

2128
01:14:41,682 --> 01:14:42,951
(I'm melting.)

2129
01:14:42,952 --> 01:14:44,281
It's so hot. What are we going to do?

2130
01:14:44,282 --> 01:14:46,882
- I'll give you a hint.
- Okay.

2131
01:14:47,452 --> 01:14:49,198
It's an organ that has two syllables in Korean.

2132
01:14:49,222 --> 01:14:51,461
- See? It's an organ.
- There are so many organs.

2133
01:14:51,462 --> 01:14:52,982
(Sang Uk predicted it to be an organ.)

2134
01:14:53,762 --> 01:14:56,131
(Sang Uk sets off.)

2135
01:14:56,132 --> 01:14:57,461
Why are you hopping? That's cheating.

2136
01:14:57,462 --> 01:14:58,601
I'm bringing the seat cushion.

2137
01:14:58,602 --> 01:14:59,662
Hopping is cheating.

2138
01:15:00,802 --> 01:15:02,642
- Let me answer. Gall bladder.
- Gall bladder.

2139
01:15:02,672 --> 01:15:03,702
Incorrect.

2140
01:15:03,772 --> 01:15:04,772
Lung.

2141
01:15:06,572 --> 01:15:07,702
Incorrect.

2142
01:15:08,912 --> 01:15:11,193
- I don't know. Gall bladder.
- Sang Uk tried it already.

2143
01:15:12,712 --> 01:15:13,712
For goodness' sake.

2144
01:15:14,482 --> 01:15:16,582
It's hot. For goodness' sake.

2145
01:15:16,812 --> 01:15:17,982
For goodness' sake.

2146
01:15:18,552 --> 01:15:21,692
(Laughing)

2147
01:15:22,192 --> 01:15:23,322
For goodness' sake.

2148
01:15:25,322 --> 01:15:27,092
- Kidney.
- Kidney.

2149
01:15:28,392 --> 01:15:29,492
Incorrect.

2150
01:15:29,662 --> 01:15:30,862
I feel bad. Oh, no.

2151
01:15:31,402 --> 01:15:33,162
Renal organ? Kidney.

2152
01:15:34,102 --> 01:15:35,132
Kidney is incorrect.

2153
01:15:35,772 --> 01:15:37,972
- They're the same thing.
- I tried the answer already.

2154
01:15:38,602 --> 01:15:39,801
Renal organ and kidney are the same thing.

2155
01:15:39,802 --> 01:15:40,901
(It's hot indeed.)

2156
01:15:40,902 --> 01:15:42,612
I won't go!

2157
01:15:43,042 --> 01:15:44,072
I won't go!

2158
01:15:44,842 --> 01:15:45,981
(While the younger ones are having a relay of incorrect answers)

2159
01:15:45,982 --> 01:15:47,112
Hold on.

2160
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:50,982
The floor is much better.

2161
01:15:51,522 --> 01:15:52,622
That's right.

2162
01:15:53,322 --> 01:15:54,822
That's right. This is it.

2163
01:15:55,122 --> 01:15:56,852
It must be a difficult question.

2164
01:16:00,422 --> 01:16:01,991
It must be a part we know.

2165
01:16:01,992 --> 01:16:03,661
It can't be a part we don't know.

2166
01:16:03,662 --> 01:16:06,061
Of course. You'll recognize the name.

2167
01:16:06,062 --> 01:16:08,672
(They'll recognize the name.)

2168
01:16:09,332 --> 01:16:10,671
- You don't know, do you?
- It's so cool.

2169
01:16:10,672 --> 01:16:12,442
It's a bit cold for me now.

2170
01:16:12,702 --> 01:16:14,302
(Peek-a-boo)

2171
01:16:15,172 --> 01:16:16,871
(It's a bit cold for me now.)

2172
01:16:16,872 --> 01:16:19,111
The cold air will escape. Close the door.

2173
01:16:19,112 --> 01:16:21,551
It's a bit cold for me now.

2174
01:16:21,552 --> 01:16:24,452
(It's the winter kingdom.)

2175
01:16:24,512 --> 01:16:25,981
I made the room optimal.

2176
01:16:25,982 --> 01:16:27,321
- It's like a different country.
- Tae Hyun,

2177
01:16:27,322 --> 01:16:29,121
the room smells like a fridge.

2178
01:16:29,122 --> 01:16:30,721
- It's hot.
- Hurry up and answer correctly.

2179
01:16:30,722 --> 01:16:33,091
(Hurry up and answer correctly. I'm cold.)

2180
01:16:33,092 --> 01:16:35,062
Isn't collagen the best part of a pig?

2181
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:37,092
We tried the rind.

2182
01:16:37,232 --> 01:16:38,832
- It's the bladder.
- Bladder?

2183
01:16:40,002 --> 01:16:41,101
- That must be it.
- Bladder.

2184
01:16:41,102 --> 01:16:42,102
That must be it.

2185
01:16:42,302 --> 01:16:43,901
(Laughing)

2186
01:16:43,902 --> 01:16:45,471
- You guys are evil.
- I think it's correct.

2187
01:16:45,472 --> 01:16:46,801
- You guys are evil.
- Is it incorrect?

2188
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:48,211
- I forgot about the bladder.
- You guys are evil.

2189
01:16:48,212 --> 01:16:49,711
- I'll go with the bladder.
- Come to think of it...

2190
01:16:49,712 --> 01:16:51,071
- Yi Kyung.
- Bladder.

2191
01:16:51,072 --> 01:16:52,672
- Yi Kyung.
- Isn't it the gall bladder?

2192
01:16:53,242 --> 01:16:54,242
Gall bladder?

2193
01:16:54,852 --> 01:16:55,852
Incorrect.

2194
01:16:56,782 --> 01:16:58,482
- Bladder.
- Bladder is correct.

2195
01:16:59,982 --> 01:17:01,522
- Bladder.
- Bladder is correct.

2196
01:17:02,392 --> 01:17:04,761
- I told you that it was true.
- No way.

2197
01:17:04,762 --> 01:17:05,891
(Why is it correct?)

2198
01:17:05,892 --> 01:17:06,992
It's hot.

2199
01:17:07,262 --> 01:17:09,561
The correct answer was the bladder. I shouldn't have said anything.

2200
01:17:09,562 --> 01:17:11,338
(Sang Uk said it was an organ. Dong Hyun said it was a bladder.)

2201
01:17:11,362 --> 01:17:14,202
(He succeeded in stealing the answer.)

2202
01:17:14,832 --> 01:17:18,002
(For the 2nd time, Seung Ho enters the air-conditioned room.)

2203
01:17:18,872 --> 01:17:21,071
- Here comes the question.
- Hold on.

2204
01:17:21,072 --> 01:17:23,232
I'll put my cellphone and snacks in front of the door.

2205
01:17:24,372 --> 01:17:27,612
(He's determined to enter the air-conditioned room.)

2206
01:17:27,742 --> 01:17:30,981
Corkage is a word that combines...

2207
01:17:30,982 --> 01:17:32,522
"Blank" and "Charge."

2208
01:17:32,722 --> 01:17:34,282
What goes in the blank?

2209
01:17:34,722 --> 01:17:35,921
"Blank" and "Charge?"

2210
01:17:35,922 --> 01:17:37,421
(Corkage is a word that combines "Blank" and "Charge.")

2211
01:17:37,422 --> 01:17:39,292
(What goes in the blank?)

2212
01:17:41,432 --> 01:17:43,661
(Sang Uk takes the lead this time.)

2213
01:17:43,662 --> 01:17:45,232
What? For goodness' sake.

2214
01:17:45,432 --> 01:17:46,961
(The order of arrival is Sang Uk, Yi Kyung, and Dong Hyun.)

2215
01:17:46,962 --> 01:17:49,002
- Go ahead.
- Corkage.

2216
01:17:53,002 --> 01:17:54,272
The floor is the coldest.

2217
01:17:56,042 --> 01:17:57,241
The floor is the coldest.

2218
01:17:57,242 --> 01:17:58,281
(Tae Hyun learned about the floor in the winter kingdom.)

2219
01:17:58,282 --> 01:17:59,982
You just need to lie still on the floor.

2220
01:18:00,412 --> 01:18:01,912
Place.

2221
01:18:02,312 --> 01:18:03,352
Place?

2222
01:18:03,982 --> 01:18:05,222
- Go back.
- Incorrect.

2223
01:18:05,552 --> 01:18:07,221
- Corkage?
- Let me answer. Cork.

2224
01:18:07,222 --> 01:18:08,291
"Cork" is correct.

2225
01:18:08,292 --> 01:18:09,352
Okay!

2226
01:18:09,892 --> 01:18:10,921
Cork?

2227
01:18:10,922 --> 01:18:12,361
(It's hot. I feel so dejected.)

2228
01:18:12,362 --> 01:18:13,461
Okay!

2229
01:18:13,462 --> 01:18:14,931
(The 2nd timer exits the room quickly.)

2230
01:18:14,932 --> 01:18:16,532
- "Cork" and "Charge?" - Yes.

2231
01:18:17,562 --> 01:18:19,832
(Screaming)

2232
01:18:20,032 --> 01:18:21,971
This is it.

2233
01:18:21,972 --> 01:18:23,652
(He finally gets a taste of civilization.)

2234
01:18:25,002 --> 01:18:27,642
(Happy)

2235
01:18:30,042 --> 01:18:31,941
- Give us the next question.
- Okay.

2236
01:18:31,942 --> 01:18:34,018
(The temperature is close to 36°C due to the heat wave.)

2237
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:36,052
(For the air-conditioned room, )

2238
01:18:36,912 --> 01:18:39,622
(the members who live Life in Shortage compete.)

2239
01:18:39,822 --> 01:18:41,082
I'll go in there once.

2240
01:18:41,892 --> 01:18:43,652
(The one who suffers due to the heat)

2241
01:18:43,892 --> 01:18:45,892
I can't go anymore. It's exhausting.

2242
01:18:46,322 --> 01:18:47,722
(The one who has never been)

2243
01:18:47,762 --> 01:18:48,992
The floor is the coldest.

2244
01:18:50,032 --> 01:18:51,802
(The one who has been once)

2245
01:18:52,032 --> 01:18:53,131
(And...)

2246
01:18:53,132 --> 01:18:54,732
- It's so hot.
- What is Seung Ho doing?

2247
01:18:55,202 --> 01:18:56,331
(The one that just came out, Rascal Seung Ho)

2248
01:18:56,332 --> 01:18:58,132
All right. Here's the question.

2249
01:18:58,872 --> 01:19:00,642
When families were struggling in the past,

2250
01:19:00,742 --> 01:19:02,842
cows were sold to make some money.

2251
01:19:03,112 --> 01:19:06,412
This wasn't sold and kept when selling the cow.

2252
01:19:07,182 --> 01:19:09,051
The reason for that was because there was a belief that...

2253
01:19:09,052 --> 01:19:10,611
when a new cow was raised after selling this,

2254
01:19:10,612 --> 01:19:12,182
the cow got sick often...

2255
01:19:12,422 --> 01:19:15,491
and the family's wealth went out with it.

2256
01:19:15,492 --> 01:19:16,822
What is this?

2257
01:19:16,992 --> 01:19:19,062
- Wait.
- What was that about?

2258
01:19:19,362 --> 01:19:20,642
Did you understand the question?

2259
01:19:22,792 --> 01:19:25,001
Do you know the answer? I didn't even get the question.

2260
01:19:25,002 --> 01:19:26,302
I didn't get it either.

2261
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:28,632
The nose ring.

2262
01:19:29,332 --> 01:19:30,872
It's definitely the nose ring.

2263
01:19:31,802 --> 01:19:33,102
- Definitely.
- The nose ring.

2264
01:19:33,342 --> 01:19:34,372
The nose ring?

2265
01:19:35,072 --> 01:19:36,111
Correct.

2266
01:19:36,112 --> 01:19:38,341
(Answer: Nose ring)

2267
01:19:38,342 --> 01:19:39,342
Correct.

2268
01:19:40,012 --> 01:19:43,082
(I have to keep my mouth shut.)

2269
01:19:43,312 --> 01:19:46,582
(Laughing)

2270
01:19:47,152 --> 01:19:48,991
(You're already here?)

2271
01:19:48,992 --> 01:19:50,121
I just...

2272
01:19:50,122 --> 01:19:51,391
(He only had one sip of the soda.)

2273
01:19:51,392 --> 01:19:52,622
I just picked up my phone.

2274
01:19:53,422 --> 01:19:55,291
- What was the answer?
- The nose ring.

2275
01:19:55,292 --> 01:19:57,292
(He leaves bitterly before he cools off the heat.)

2276
01:19:57,692 --> 01:20:02,032
(Dong Hyun is slowly melting.)

2277
01:20:02,732 --> 01:20:05,901
(It's so hot.)

2278
01:20:05,902 --> 01:20:06,971
(Ouch!)

2279
01:20:06,972 --> 01:20:08,841
I'm coming here so many times. That's enough.

2280
01:20:08,842 --> 01:20:09,871
(Tribe Handsome's Life in Shortage is a mess.)

2281
01:20:09,872 --> 01:20:11,812
I won't come back!

2282
01:20:13,082 --> 01:20:14,311
- I won't come back!
- Can we start right away?

2283
01:20:14,312 --> 01:20:15,351
Let's start right away!

2284
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:17,951
Usually, rare and well done...

2285
01:20:17,952 --> 01:20:20,352
were words used to express how much a steak was cooked.

2286
01:20:20,682 --> 01:20:22,451
But according to a rumor,

2287
01:20:22,452 --> 01:20:26,162
they were words that were used to express how much this was cooked.

2288
01:20:26,522 --> 01:20:27,962
What is this?

2289
01:20:29,432 --> 01:20:31,462
- Gosh.
- What else could there be?

2290
01:20:32,232 --> 01:20:33,902
(I'm 1st this time.)

2291
01:20:34,402 --> 01:20:35,701
There's something that came to mind.

2292
01:20:35,702 --> 01:20:36,978
(Sang Uk moves forward diligently whether he knows it or not.)

2293
01:20:37,002 --> 01:20:38,841
Just guess!

2294
01:20:38,842 --> 01:20:40,402
I'm going to go in once no matter what!

2295
01:20:41,272 --> 01:20:42,832
I'm going to go in once no matter what!

2296
01:20:42,942 --> 01:20:43,942
Just guess!

2297
01:20:43,943 --> 01:20:46,411
(They start to form a line.)

2298
01:20:46,412 --> 01:20:47,972
I'm going to go in once no matter what!

2299
01:20:48,612 --> 01:20:50,052
I really have an answer.

2300
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:51,621
What else could it be instead of a steak?

2301
01:20:51,622 --> 01:20:54,851
(Will these two be able to enter the Cold Room today?)

2302
01:20:54,852 --> 01:20:56,751
- Instead of steak, it's fish!
- Fish!

2303
01:20:56,752 --> 01:20:57,851
(Answer: Fish)

2304
01:20:57,852 --> 01:20:58,922
Incorrect!

2305
01:20:59,662 --> 01:21:01,321
- Bread.
- Bread?

2306
01:21:01,322 --> 01:21:03,361
- It's bread?
- Really?

2307
01:21:03,362 --> 01:21:04,432
Incorrect.

2308
01:21:05,702 --> 01:21:07,422
Doesn't bread definitely have to be cooked?

2309
01:21:08,902 --> 01:21:10,431
That doesn't make sense.

2310
01:21:10,432 --> 01:21:12,072
(Bread is just dough if it isn't cooked.)

2311
01:21:12,172 --> 01:21:16,112
(He answered 0 percent of the questions.)

2312
01:21:19,042 --> 01:21:21,212
Gosh, it's hot. It's too hot.

2313
01:21:21,652 --> 01:21:23,451
- Gosh.
- Gosh, what?

2314
01:21:23,452 --> 01:21:25,251
What are you doing, Tae Hyun?

2315
01:21:25,252 --> 01:21:26,581
- Tae Hyun!
- Aren't you done?

2316
01:21:26,582 --> 01:21:28,491
You have to follow the rules of this place.

2317
01:21:28,492 --> 01:21:30,092
Get back in line!

2318
01:21:30,422 --> 01:21:32,861
- One, two, three, - I haven't seen this for a while.

2319
01:21:32,862 --> 01:21:34,892
- Have you seen this?
- four, five.

2320
01:21:35,092 --> 01:21:36,491
- Hurry up!
- Okay.

2321
01:21:36,492 --> 01:21:38,162
Just say anything and move back.

2322
01:21:38,292 --> 01:21:39,762
How much "this" was cooked?

2323
01:21:39,832 --> 01:21:42,101
Oh, right! Noodles or pasta!

2324
01:21:42,102 --> 01:21:43,171
Noodles?

2325
01:21:43,172 --> 01:21:44,371
(Answer: Pasta, noodles)

2326
01:21:44,372 --> 01:21:45,541
Noodles or pasta.

2327
01:21:45,542 --> 01:21:47,372
I was reminded of ramyeon from this.

2328
01:21:47,872 --> 01:21:48,872
Incorrect.

2329
01:21:51,012 --> 01:21:52,682
- Vegetables.
- Vegetables?

2330
01:21:53,412 --> 01:21:55,512
- What?
- No.

2331
01:21:55,812 --> 01:21:57,651
- Vegetables.
- Move to the back.

2332
01:21:57,652 --> 01:21:58,972
- Incorrect.
- Gosh, it's so hot.

2333
01:21:59,182 --> 01:22:01,221
I won't come back.

2334
01:22:01,222 --> 01:22:02,698
(The relay of incorrect answers has started again.)

2335
01:22:02,722 --> 01:22:04,921
- Give us a hint.
- I think you can give us a hint.

2336
01:22:04,922 --> 01:22:05,961
Right.

2337
01:22:05,962 --> 01:22:08,091
Even now, this is something that is eaten...

2338
01:22:08,092 --> 01:22:10,662
with different preferences on how much it is cooked.

2339
01:22:11,132 --> 01:22:12,832
It's something that Dong Hyun likes.

2340
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:14,462
(I like this?)

2341
01:22:14,463 --> 01:22:16,303
Seung Ho has been in the room for a long time.

2342
01:22:16,702 --> 01:22:17,831
This is something that Dong Hyun likes?

2343
01:22:17,832 --> 01:22:18,842
(What could it be?)

2344
01:22:19,742 --> 01:22:21,272
(Groaning)

2345
01:22:21,912 --> 01:22:23,712
(He got something.)

2346
01:22:23,912 --> 01:22:26,882
Finally!

2347
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:29,511
(Finally!)

2348
01:22:29,512 --> 01:22:32,852
I will finally go into the room!

2349
01:22:33,152 --> 01:22:34,221
Egg!

2350
01:22:34,222 --> 01:22:35,321
(Answer: Egg)

2351
01:22:35,322 --> 01:22:36,422
- Egg?
- Yes.

2352
01:22:36,492 --> 01:22:37,492
- He's right.
- He's right.

2353
01:22:37,493 --> 01:22:38,922
- Egg.
- Yes.

2354
01:22:39,292 --> 01:22:40,361
Correct.

2355
01:22:40,362 --> 01:22:42,032
(Answer: Egg)

2356
01:22:42,832 --> 01:22:43,832
(Cheering)

2357
01:22:46,002 --> 01:22:49,602
(Kim Dong Hyun finally gets the answer.)

2358
01:22:51,172 --> 01:22:55,172
(After endless advancements toward the answer...)

2359
01:22:56,172 --> 01:23:00,412
(and going through mountains of incorrect answers, )

2360
01:23:01,712 --> 01:23:04,051
(I have come, )

2361
01:23:04,052 --> 01:23:06,422
(I have spoken, )

2362
01:23:06,882 --> 01:23:08,852
(and I have gotten it right.)

2363
01:23:09,252 --> 01:23:11,321
(You finally made it.)

2364
01:23:11,322 --> 01:23:14,592
I will finally go into the room!

2365
01:23:14,962 --> 01:23:16,491
Go in quickly.

2366
01:23:16,492 --> 01:23:19,131
Oh, right.

2367
01:23:19,132 --> 01:23:20,261
Let me take this.

2368
01:23:20,262 --> 01:23:21,462
- Are there any drinks?
- Hey.

2369
01:23:21,632 --> 01:23:22,701
- Gosh.
- Did you like the hint?

2370
01:23:22,702 --> 01:23:25,302
It was great. Thank you.

2371
01:23:26,002 --> 01:23:28,271
- Gosh, it's cold!
- Lie down right next to the wall.

2372
01:23:28,272 --> 01:23:30,141
(Winner winner, winter dinner)

2373
01:23:30,142 --> 01:23:31,142
It's cold!

2374
01:23:31,842 --> 01:23:33,642
Could you get me a duck-down jacket, Sang Uk?

2375
01:23:33,682 --> 01:23:35,411
A duck-down jacket. It's so cold.

2376
01:23:35,412 --> 01:23:36,581
(Upset)

2377
01:23:36,582 --> 01:23:37,712
- Gosh, it's hot!
- Gosh!

2378
01:23:38,352 --> 01:23:39,352
Here?

2379
01:23:39,353 --> 01:23:41,221
(He meets powerful air conditioning after a time of suffering.)

2380
01:23:41,222 --> 01:23:42,292
It feels so nice.

2381
01:23:43,652 --> 01:23:44,852
It's so hot.

2382
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:46,692
It's so hot.

2383
01:23:48,492 --> 01:23:50,831
It's so hot. It's so hot that I can't even lie down.

2384
01:23:50,832 --> 01:23:52,801
(It was so hot out there.)

2385
01:23:52,802 --> 01:23:53,832
It's so hot.

2386
01:23:55,402 --> 01:23:56,431
Gosh, this feels great.

2387
01:23:56,432 --> 01:23:58,101
(Let's stay happy in here for a long time.)

2388
01:23:58,102 --> 01:23:59,102
Gosh, it's hot!

2389
01:24:00,072 --> 01:24:01,472
Here's the question.

2390
01:24:02,812 --> 01:24:04,171
In Thailand,

2391
01:24:04,172 --> 01:24:07,242
you must not do this in the restroom.

2392
01:24:08,042 --> 01:24:09,451
What is this?

2393
01:24:09,452 --> 01:24:11,451
(In Thailand, you must not do this in the restroom.)

2394
01:24:11,452 --> 01:24:14,152
(What is this?)

2395
01:24:14,452 --> 01:24:15,622
Whatever. I'll give it a try.

2396
01:24:16,292 --> 01:24:17,492
Come if you get an answer.

2397
01:24:18,592 --> 01:24:20,561
- Come if you get an answer.
- It's done in our country?

2398
01:24:20,562 --> 01:24:21,592
But...

2399
01:24:22,132 --> 01:24:24,332
what could it be?

2400
01:24:25,402 --> 01:24:27,801
(What is Yi Kyung's answer after moving right away?)

2401
01:24:27,802 --> 01:24:29,132
- Knocking.
- Knocking.

2402
01:24:29,502 --> 01:24:30,531
What?

2403
01:24:30,532 --> 01:24:32,002
(Answer: Knocking)

2404
01:24:32,342 --> 01:24:35,412
(Knocking isn't done in the restroom?)

2405
01:24:35,672 --> 01:24:36,741
Gosh, this feels nice.

2406
01:24:36,742 --> 01:24:38,041
(Dong Hyun is spending a refreshing time.)

2407
01:24:38,042 --> 01:24:39,142
Gosh, it's hot!

2408
01:24:41,142 --> 01:24:42,611
- You must not do this...
- The restroom?

2409
01:24:42,612 --> 01:24:44,312
In the restroom.

2410
01:24:44,582 --> 01:24:46,522
- The restroom?
- What is this?

2411
01:24:47,722 --> 01:24:48,822
Isn't it too easy?

2412
01:24:50,692 --> 01:24:51,991
(He opens up the snack first.)

2413
01:24:51,992 --> 01:24:53,391
Lending tissues to the next stall!

2414
01:24:53,392 --> 01:24:54,462
(Chuckling)

2415
01:24:55,732 --> 01:24:56,762
Get out!

2416
01:24:58,432 --> 01:24:59,502
Hurry up and get out.

2417
01:25:00,402 --> 01:25:02,201
(He gets kicked out in just 1 minute.)

2418
01:25:02,202 --> 01:25:03,202
Get out!

2419
01:25:03,203 --> 01:25:05,071
(He practiced to have a future with his partner.)

2420
01:25:05,072 --> 01:25:06,072
Hurry up and get out.

2421
01:25:06,073 --> 01:25:07,902
Put the snack down. I'll have it.

2422
01:25:08,912 --> 01:25:10,942
Take your cushion. Here.

2423
01:25:11,312 --> 01:25:13,241
Take your cushion. Here.

2424
01:25:13,242 --> 01:25:16,482
(He gets kicked out after just 1 minute.)

2425
01:25:17,152 --> 01:25:19,482
How can you give them such an easy question?

2426
01:25:20,922 --> 01:25:21,922
(Full of complaints)

2427
01:25:21,923 --> 01:25:22,991
Hey!

2428
01:25:22,992 --> 01:25:26,092
What else is there to do in the restroom?

2429
01:25:26,562 --> 01:25:28,161
That was such an easy question.

2430
01:25:28,162 --> 01:25:29,842
(Why give an easy question just for them?)

2431
01:25:29,932 --> 01:25:31,291
I've been in here for more than five minutes.

2432
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:34,062
(Yi Kyung manages to retake the Cold Room.)

2433
01:25:34,562 --> 01:25:36,302
- Here's the question right away.
- Okay.

2434
01:25:36,902 --> 01:25:39,041
Based on the different cuts of beef,

2435
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:41,372
their names were slightly different in the past.

2436
01:25:41,802 --> 01:25:43,442
The ribeye was known as the flower meat.

2437
01:25:44,042 --> 01:25:47,182
The tenderloin was known as the safe meat.

2438
01:25:47,482 --> 01:25:51,311
Which part is the white meat?

2439
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:52,822
- What?
- White meat?

2440
01:25:53,452 --> 01:25:54,452
It's beef?

2441
01:25:54,453 --> 01:25:55,552
- Hold on.
- Yes.

2442
01:25:55,752 --> 01:25:57,091
What are you doing?

2443
01:25:57,092 --> 01:25:58,451
That was a false start.

2444
01:25:58,452 --> 01:26:00,598
(Sang Uk takes 1st place after pointing out the false start.)

2445
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:03,462
(Will he be able to get it right this time?)

2446
01:26:03,862 --> 01:26:06,032
- The white meat is the paddywhack.
- Paddywhack!

2447
01:26:06,502 --> 01:26:07,832
- Incorrect.
- It's not that?

2448
01:26:09,832 --> 01:26:12,541
(When will I get into the Cold Room?)

2449
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:14,242
This part. The knee cap.

2450
01:26:14,642 --> 01:26:16,072
- The knee cap?
- This part.

2451
01:26:16,242 --> 01:26:17,672
- The cartilage.
- Incorrect.

2452
01:26:18,212 --> 01:26:19,681
- The chuck flap tail.
- The chuck flap tail?

2453
01:26:19,682 --> 01:26:21,282
- The marbling is distinct.
- Incorrect.

2454
01:26:21,742 --> 01:26:22,781
The top blade.

2455
01:26:22,782 --> 01:26:23,942
- The top blade?
- Incorrect.

2456
01:26:24,582 --> 01:26:25,922
- Tenderloin.
- Incorrect!

2457
01:26:26,122 --> 01:26:27,382
- Tripe!
- Incorrect!

2458
01:26:27,582 --> 01:26:28,852
- The skirt.
- Incorrect!

2459
01:26:29,192 --> 01:26:30,492
- The beef tongue.
- Incorrect!

2460
01:26:31,552 --> 01:26:33,261
(Loving the incorrect answers)

2461
01:26:33,262 --> 01:26:34,592
This question must be hard.

2462
01:26:36,332 --> 01:26:39,231
(While they are continuing to get the question wrong...)

2463
01:26:39,232 --> 01:26:40,232
Hey.

2464
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:42,872
- Where are you?
- I'm in Gapyeong.

2465
01:26:43,702 --> 01:26:44,732
Honey.

2466
01:26:45,132 --> 01:26:47,072
Out of beef cuts,

2467
01:26:47,502 --> 01:26:49,272
what is the white meat?

2468
01:26:50,942 --> 01:26:52,481
White meat, honey?

2469
01:26:52,482 --> 01:26:53,612
White meat.

2470
01:26:54,042 --> 01:26:55,582
What could the white meat be?

2471
01:26:56,052 --> 01:26:57,552
You love eating beef.

2472
01:26:57,882 --> 01:27:01,222
Which cut could be called the white meat?

2473
01:27:01,752 --> 01:27:02,991
Well, usually...

2474
01:27:02,992 --> 01:27:04,421
(This part is white.)

2475
01:27:04,422 --> 01:27:05,662
But...

2476
01:27:06,762 --> 01:27:07,861
The beef tongue?

2477
01:27:07,862 --> 01:27:10,691
(What is it?)

2478
01:27:10,692 --> 01:27:12,092
- It's the beef tongue?
- I got it!

2479
01:27:12,302 --> 01:27:14,002
Just a moment. Please wait for your turn.

2480
01:27:15,502 --> 01:27:17,701
- Do you know the answer?
- Well,

2481
01:27:17,702 --> 01:27:19,101
this cut wasn't mentioned.

2482
01:27:19,102 --> 01:27:21,271
- It wasn't mentioned yet.
- I haven't gone yet.

2483
01:27:21,272 --> 01:27:22,341
Hurry.

2484
01:27:22,342 --> 01:27:24,672
- One, two, three, - Give me a moment.

2485
01:27:24,942 --> 01:27:26,012
- four.
- It's a beef cut.

2486
01:27:26,812 --> 01:27:27,911
It's the cow's...

2487
01:27:27,912 --> 01:27:29,951
(Feel even hotter.)

2488
01:27:29,952 --> 01:27:32,422
- No one mentioned this.
- backbone.

2489
01:27:32,752 --> 01:27:33,881
Backbone?

2490
01:27:33,882 --> 01:27:35,521
(It's incorrect, isn't it?)

2491
01:27:35,522 --> 01:27:37,092
- Move away.
- Incorrect!

2492
01:27:37,522 --> 01:27:38,721
- What is it?
- I got it.

2493
01:27:38,722 --> 01:27:39,722
This one wasn't mentioned.

2494
01:27:39,723 --> 01:27:40,921
- What is it?
- The beef brisket.

2495
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:42,162
- Correct.
- Oh, right!

2496
01:27:42,862 --> 01:27:43,891
- Correct.
- Oh, right!

2497
01:27:43,892 --> 01:27:45,131
(Screaming)

2498
01:27:45,132 --> 01:27:46,361
- The beef brisket!
- Thank you!

2499
01:27:46,362 --> 01:27:48,032
(Thank you!)

2500
01:27:48,932 --> 01:27:50,501
It makes sense right away.

2501
01:27:50,502 --> 01:27:51,632
It's the beef brisket.

2502
01:27:52,602 --> 01:27:53,671
I've been in here enough.

2503
01:27:53,672 --> 01:27:55,101
(Tae Hyun reenters the Cold Room.)

2504
01:27:55,102 --> 01:27:56,342
Are calls allowed?

2505
01:27:56,742 --> 01:27:57,972
I'll just have a sip.

2506
01:27:58,342 --> 01:27:59,841
I didn't make a call on purpose.

2507
01:27:59,842 --> 01:28:01,942
I got a call naturally.

2508
01:28:02,512 --> 01:28:04,382
That's still a phone call.

2509
01:28:05,352 --> 01:28:07,821
The one who enjoys eating meat is really different.

2510
01:28:07,822 --> 01:28:10,352
- Gosh.
- I said it was white meat...

2511
01:28:10,622 --> 01:28:11,922
and she got it right away.

2512
01:28:12,062 --> 01:28:13,561
- He's inside.
- That's just amazing.

2513
01:28:13,562 --> 01:28:14,661
Get the rascal out of the room.

2514
01:28:14,662 --> 01:28:16,132
Gosh, what?

2515
01:28:16,632 --> 01:28:18,062
He locked it!

2516
01:28:18,902 --> 01:28:20,462
Come on! Open up.

2517
01:28:20,662 --> 01:28:22,701
- Gosh!
- I was keeping the room safe.

2518
01:28:22,702 --> 01:28:24,262
I didn't want the cold air to seep out.

2519
01:28:24,932 --> 01:28:27,302
(Cold Room usage ranking up until now)

2520
01:28:28,702 --> 01:28:29,911
(Tae Hyun: 10 minutes, Dong Hyun: 1 minute)

2521
01:28:29,912 --> 01:28:31,071
(Yi Kyung: 5 minutes, Seung Ho: 16 minutes)

2522
01:28:31,072 --> 01:28:33,441
(Sang Uk: 0 minutes)

2523
01:28:33,442 --> 01:28:34,711
(The question for 10 minutes in the Cold Room)

2524
01:28:34,712 --> 01:28:38,152
The last question will be for ten minutes in the Cold Room.

2525
01:28:38,682 --> 01:28:39,981
- This is huge!
- The most important question.

2526
01:28:39,982 --> 01:28:43,391
It will be ten minutes for the one who gets it right.

2527
01:28:43,392 --> 01:28:46,461
The next person to get it right can join in,

2528
01:28:46,462 --> 01:28:48,091
but they have to come out together when the ten minutes are up.

2529
01:28:48,092 --> 01:28:49,892
- Okay.
- Okay.

2530
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:53,102
(To claim the Cold Room, )

2531
01:28:53,702 --> 01:28:56,472
(the last battle will begin.)

2532
01:28:56,572 --> 01:28:58,572
- We will begin.
- Gosh.

2533
01:28:58,802 --> 01:29:01,842
- In France in the 17th century...
- Gosh!

2534
01:29:01,872 --> 01:29:03,141
I can get this one.

2535
01:29:03,142 --> 01:29:04,411
In France in the 17th century,

2536
01:29:04,412 --> 01:29:07,942
it was a trend to apply beauty marks on the face.

2537
01:29:08,182 --> 01:29:09,411
These beauty marks...

2538
01:29:09,412 --> 01:29:12,522
had different meanings based on the position.

2539
01:29:12,752 --> 01:29:14,481
A beauty mark next to the eye...

2540
01:29:14,482 --> 01:29:16,022
meant passionate love.

2541
01:29:16,492 --> 01:29:18,222
A beauty mark placed on a dimple...

2542
01:29:18,322 --> 01:29:22,162
meant that the person was deciding to be in love or not.

2543
01:29:22,362 --> 01:29:23,531
Then...

2544
01:29:23,532 --> 01:29:26,531
what did a beauty mark on the nose mean?

2545
01:29:26,532 --> 01:29:31,372
(What did a beauty mark on the nose mean?)

2546
01:29:32,202 --> 01:29:34,041
(They all move forward together.)

2547
01:29:34,042 --> 01:29:35,472
(Screaming)

2548
01:29:36,112 --> 01:29:37,512
(Rolling)

2549
01:29:38,042 --> 01:29:40,782
(He chafes his knees against the floor!)

2550
01:29:41,482 --> 01:29:44,282
- You need your cushion!
- You don't have your cushion!

2551
01:29:45,012 --> 01:29:46,221
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

2552
01:29:46,222 --> 01:29:47,382
Go slowly.

2553
01:29:47,882 --> 01:29:48,921
All right.

2554
01:29:48,922 --> 01:29:49,922
(He's fine.)

2555
01:29:50,122 --> 01:29:52,292
(Thinking)

2556
01:29:53,522 --> 01:29:54,661
Wealth.

2557
01:29:54,662 --> 01:29:55,662
(Answer: Wealth)

2558
01:29:55,663 --> 01:29:57,332
It was based on love.

2559
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:58,931
- What?
- Incorrect.

2560
01:29:58,932 --> 01:30:00,002
Incorrect.

2561
01:30:00,602 --> 01:30:02,332
I want to go in so bad.

2562
01:30:02,772 --> 01:30:04,602
"In search of a lover."

2563
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,842
Incorrect.

2564
01:30:06,172 --> 01:30:07,472
"I want to get married."

2565
01:30:07,842 --> 01:30:08,912
Incorrect.

2566
01:30:10,442 --> 01:30:14,542
(Next up is the Quiz King of the Middle Ages, Sang Uk.)

2567
01:30:15,382 --> 01:30:17,211
(He started by getting...)

2568
01:30:17,212 --> 01:30:19,398
(the armor question right as the reason for men being on diets.)

2569
01:30:19,422 --> 01:30:21,281
(He even guessed right the role as a taster...)

2570
01:30:21,282 --> 01:30:23,192
(for sommeliers in the Middle Ages.)

2571
01:30:23,752 --> 01:30:26,921
(He even got the origin of the word "honeymoon.")

2572
01:30:26,922 --> 01:30:29,332
(He became the Quiz King of the Middle Ages.)

2573
01:30:29,892 --> 01:30:31,661
(Will he be able to get the quiz right of the Middle Ages...)

2574
01:30:31,662 --> 01:30:33,432
(and head into the Cold Room?)

2575
01:30:34,062 --> 01:30:35,731
"Don't get interested in me."

2576
01:30:35,732 --> 01:30:37,731
(Answer: Don't get interested in me.)

2577
01:30:37,732 --> 01:30:39,641
- That must be it.
- What?

2578
01:30:39,642 --> 01:30:40,801
"Oh Sang Uk is correct."

2579
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:42,671
- What was that?
- It's wrong if it isn't accurate.

2580
01:30:42,672 --> 01:30:43,771
(Has the Quiz King of the Middle Ages got it right?)

2581
01:30:43,772 --> 01:30:45,141
- That was just like mine.
- That was so close.

2582
01:30:45,142 --> 01:30:46,412
Incorrect.

2583
01:30:46,712 --> 01:30:48,211
(That was close?)

2584
01:30:48,212 --> 01:30:49,682
No.

2585
01:30:49,952 --> 01:30:52,152
Passionate love was mentioned.

2586
01:30:52,822 --> 01:30:54,552
Passionate love, Sang Uk.

2587
01:30:54,682 --> 01:30:56,051
You fool.

2588
01:30:56,052 --> 01:30:57,898
(The Quiz King of the Middle Ages is strict against himself.)

2589
01:30:57,922 --> 01:30:59,291
Celibacy.

2590
01:30:59,292 --> 01:31:01,022
Celibacy is incorrect!

2591
01:31:01,122 --> 01:31:02,931
"It hasn't been long since I've been through a break up."

2592
01:31:02,932 --> 01:31:04,092
Incorrect!

2593
01:31:04,492 --> 01:31:05,861
"I want to be in an innocent love."

2594
01:31:05,862 --> 01:31:07,061
("I want to be in an innocent love.")

2595
01:31:07,062 --> 01:31:08,231
What? Incorrect!

2596
01:31:08,232 --> 01:31:09,232
I just made a guess.

2597
01:31:09,372 --> 01:31:10,802
My gosh!

2598
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,441
What do I do?

2599
01:31:12,442 --> 01:31:13,902
I really want to get it right.

2600
01:31:16,112 --> 01:31:18,941
"Interest." That goes in the answer.

2601
01:31:18,942 --> 01:31:20,111
Okay. That's good enough.

2602
01:31:20,112 --> 01:31:21,141
That goes in the answer.

2603
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:22,881
"I want to be alone. Have no interest in me."

2604
01:31:22,882 --> 01:31:25,311
(I want to be alone. Have no interest in me.)

2605
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:26,422
Incorrect!

2606
01:31:26,852 --> 01:31:28,652
- It must be along those lines.
- "Interest."

2607
01:31:28,852 --> 01:31:30,551
"I'm not interested in being in love."

2608
01:31:30,552 --> 01:31:33,021
(Answer: I'm not interested in being in love.)

2609
01:31:33,022 --> 01:31:34,092
Incorrect.

2610
01:31:35,762 --> 01:31:37,232
That was really close.

2611
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:39,062
You were 98 percent right.

2612
01:31:39,932 --> 01:31:41,431
Tae Hyun woke up from his sleep.

2613
01:31:41,432 --> 01:31:43,378
(The Quiz King of the Middle Ages struggles to get the final answer.)

2614
01:31:43,402 --> 01:31:45,501
- "I'm not interested in you." - Sorry?

2615
01:31:45,502 --> 01:31:47,971
"I'm not interested in you at all."

2616
01:31:47,972 --> 01:31:49,042
- Correct!
- Gosh!

2617
01:31:50,012 --> 01:31:51,041
(Startled)

2618
01:31:51,042 --> 01:31:52,112
My gosh!

2619
01:31:52,912 --> 01:31:55,341
Why are you being like that to me?

2620
01:31:55,342 --> 01:31:56,951
- My gosh!
- Correct!

2621
01:31:56,952 --> 01:31:57,952
(That was the answer?)

2622
01:31:57,953 --> 01:31:59,321
- What was the answer?
- "I'm not interested in you."

2623
01:31:59,322 --> 01:32:01,122
"I'm not interested in you."

2624
01:32:01,782 --> 01:32:03,792
- Did I not say that earlier?
- So that was it.

2625
01:32:04,022 --> 01:32:05,551
My gosh.

2626
01:32:05,552 --> 01:32:06,591
(He lost the Cold Room right before his eyes.)

2627
01:32:06,592 --> 01:32:07,791
My snack. My phone.

2628
01:32:07,792 --> 01:32:09,862
- Why is it so hot here?
- I feel so hot.

2629
01:32:10,762 --> 01:32:11,762
Hey!

2630
01:32:11,792 --> 01:32:15,632
(The Quiz King of the Middle Ages feels thirsty.)

2631
01:32:15,872 --> 01:32:17,931
- My ten minutes will start now.
- Right.

2632
01:32:17,932 --> 01:32:19,841
"I'm not interested in you."

2633
01:32:19,842 --> 01:32:21,102
Gosh, it feels so nice here.

2634
01:32:21,642 --> 01:32:22,972
Gosh, it's warm.

2635
01:32:23,742 --> 01:32:26,181
(Tae Hyun feels perfect right now.)

2636
01:32:26,182 --> 01:32:28,112
I have to go in now.

2637
01:32:28,182 --> 01:32:29,282
I'll close the door.

2638
01:32:29,412 --> 01:32:30,451
I get ten minutes.

2639
01:32:30,452 --> 01:32:31,611
(Hi, Dong Hyun.)

2640
01:32:31,612 --> 01:32:32,652
I feel so hot.

2641
01:32:33,882 --> 01:32:35,022
It's so hot.

2642
01:32:35,652 --> 01:32:36,752
It's so hot.

2643
01:32:37,122 --> 01:32:38,352
My body feels sticky.

2644
01:32:40,922 --> 01:32:42,092
Gosh.

2645
01:32:42,492 --> 01:32:43,932
- The next question.
- Let's go.

2646
01:32:44,062 --> 01:32:45,262
We don't have much time left.

2647
01:32:45,492 --> 01:32:46,531
Curry...

2648
01:32:46,532 --> 01:32:47,931
isn't a dish enjoyed just in India.

2649
01:32:47,932 --> 01:32:50,601
It's a popular dish enjoyed...

2650
01:32:50,602 --> 01:32:52,371
in England, Japan, and Korea.

2651
01:32:52,372 --> 01:32:56,071
The Japanese navy in the 19th century...

2652
01:32:56,072 --> 01:32:59,511
ate this while sailing not to lose this.

2653
01:32:59,512 --> 01:33:00,912
What is this?

2654
01:33:01,612 --> 01:33:02,681
They ate curry?

2655
01:33:02,682 --> 01:33:03,752
Yes.

2656
01:33:06,552 --> 01:33:07,752
What is he doing?

2657
01:33:08,852 --> 01:33:11,692
(What are you doing, Seung Ho?)

2658
01:33:12,252 --> 01:33:13,862
- What are you doing?
- Is he a thug?

2659
01:33:14,462 --> 01:33:16,392
It's because there's no competition.

2660
01:33:16,492 --> 01:33:17,631
- Fine.
- I would've done it properly...

2661
01:33:17,632 --> 01:33:19,631
- if there was competition.
- That will be okay.

2662
01:33:19,632 --> 01:33:21,732
He should be careful with his knees too.

2663
01:33:22,102 --> 01:33:23,802
- Water.
- Water?

2664
01:33:24,172 --> 01:33:25,402
Incorrect.

2665
01:33:26,802 --> 01:33:27,902
The navy...

2666
01:33:28,642 --> 01:33:30,311
didn't want to lose this.

2667
01:33:30,312 --> 01:33:31,412
They were sailing.

2668
01:33:31,642 --> 01:33:32,811
- Direction.
- What?

2669
01:33:32,812 --> 01:33:34,142
I was going to do that.

2670
01:33:34,212 --> 01:33:35,281
Incorrect.

2671
01:33:35,282 --> 01:33:36,511
- It wasn't that?
- That is incorrect.

2672
01:33:36,512 --> 01:33:38,681
It's not "direction?" I'll change direction then.

2673
01:33:38,682 --> 01:33:39,821
(It's not "direction?" I'll change direction then.)

2674
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:41,081
Well,

2675
01:33:41,082 --> 01:33:43,192
do I call it the soldiers?

2676
01:33:43,252 --> 01:33:44,322
The soldiers.

2677
01:33:44,422 --> 01:33:45,522
Incorrect.

2678
01:33:45,652 --> 01:33:46,692
All right.

2679
01:33:47,362 --> 01:33:48,922
Nostalgia.

2680
01:33:49,392 --> 01:33:50,462
Incorrect.

2681
01:33:50,562 --> 01:33:52,862
(Tae Hyun still can't seem to get the right direction.)

2682
01:33:53,302 --> 01:33:54,601
Appetite.

2683
01:33:54,602 --> 01:33:56,271
(Appetite)

2684
01:33:56,272 --> 01:33:57,772
They might collapse without that.

2685
01:33:57,902 --> 01:33:59,171
They have to fight.

2686
01:33:59,172 --> 01:34:01,001
- Please move back.
- They must have an appetite.

2687
01:34:01,002 --> 01:34:02,388
(They can't seem to find the right direction for the answer.)

2688
01:34:02,412 --> 01:34:04,052
- I'll give you the hint quickly.
- Okay.

2689
01:34:04,472 --> 01:34:05,542
Seven!

2690
01:34:07,242 --> 01:34:09,712
Isn't that the only thing that is related to "seven?"

2691
01:34:10,382 --> 01:34:12,852
(Squirming)

2692
01:34:13,922 --> 01:34:15,551
This is the only thing related to "seven."

2693
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:17,192
- Here it is!
- Luck.

2694
01:34:17,422 --> 01:34:18,792
Luck is incorrect!

2695
01:34:19,122 --> 01:34:20,362
- Seven?
- Check this out.

2696
01:34:20,922 --> 01:34:22,361
Check this out.

2697
01:34:22,362 --> 01:34:24,592
- There are seven days in a week.
- Right.

2698
01:34:24,662 --> 01:34:26,201
They had curry every Sunday.

2699
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:27,361
This was not to...

2700
01:34:27,362 --> 01:34:29,601
lose track of the date.

2701
01:34:29,602 --> 01:34:31,772
They could figure out which day it was by doing that.

2702
01:34:32,272 --> 01:34:34,541
Give an accurate answer. So what did they not want to lose?

2703
01:34:34,542 --> 01:34:35,771
(It sounds like a reasonable answer.)

2704
01:34:35,772 --> 01:34:36,972
What I just said.

2705
01:34:37,842 --> 01:34:39,211
- I got it!
- Be accurate.

2706
01:34:39,212 --> 01:34:40,542
Be clear with the answer.

2707
01:34:41,182 --> 01:34:43,551
- That has to be put into an answer.
- The idea of date and time.

2708
01:34:43,552 --> 01:34:44,881
(A vague answer)

2709
01:34:44,882 --> 01:34:46,821
- That's right, isn't it?
- "Incorrect!"

2710
01:34:46,822 --> 01:34:48,221
- That was too vague.
- The date...

2711
01:34:48,222 --> 01:34:50,182
- That was too vague of an answer.
- You're next.

2712
01:34:50,292 --> 01:34:51,352
I got it!

2713
01:34:51,652 --> 01:34:52,862
I'm sorry.

2714
01:34:53,022 --> 01:34:54,092
All right.

2715
01:34:54,162 --> 01:34:55,322
Sense of the days.

2716
01:34:55,892 --> 01:34:57,232
- Sense of the days.
- I got it!

2717
01:34:57,832 --> 01:34:59,092
I'll go with sense of the date.

2718
01:34:59,732 --> 01:35:02,572
(I can't sense anything at all.)

2719
01:35:02,672 --> 01:35:04,632
"Sense of the days" is correct. Please move back.

2720
01:35:05,072 --> 01:35:06,141
(The Cushion Race is over.)

2721
01:35:06,142 --> 01:35:07,171
(Sang Uk never entered the Cold Room in the end.)

2722
01:35:07,172 --> 01:35:09,252
- I never went inside.
- It's the sense of the days.

2723
01:35:09,342 --> 01:35:10,411
You got it all of it right.

2724
01:35:10,412 --> 01:35:12,111
I wasn't able to come up with the exact answer.

2725
01:35:12,112 --> 01:35:13,752
- Sense of the days.
- Sense of the days.

2726
01:35:14,042 --> 01:35:15,481
The Cold Room is closed.

2727
01:35:15,482 --> 01:35:16,582
It's closed?

2728
01:35:17,152 --> 01:35:18,381
You may return now.

2729
01:35:18,382 --> 01:35:19,798
- Please head back.
- I never got inside.

2730
01:35:19,822 --> 01:35:20,951
It's closed.

2731
01:35:20,952 --> 01:35:21,952
(I never got inside.)

2732
01:35:23,022 --> 01:35:24,121
Fight fire with fire?

2733
01:35:24,122 --> 01:35:25,191
(The three return to the shortage of the air conditioner.)

2734
01:35:25,192 --> 01:35:26,362
Fight fire with fire.

2735
01:35:27,262 --> 01:35:28,562
It was "sense of the days?"

2736
01:35:29,022 --> 01:35:30,192
Sense of the days.

2737
01:35:30,292 --> 01:35:33,102
So they could know that it was Saturday when they had curry.

2738
01:35:33,762 --> 01:35:35,331
It's like, "Saturday is curry day."

2739
01:35:35,332 --> 01:35:36,501
It was like having jjajangmyeon...

2740
01:35:36,502 --> 01:35:38,331
on Sundays when we were young.

2741
01:35:38,332 --> 01:35:40,142
(Time left in the Cold Room)

2742
01:35:40,272 --> 01:35:42,102
Gosh, it's hot. This is so tough.

2743
01:35:44,112 --> 01:35:45,511
How will we sleep tonight?

2744
01:35:45,512 --> 01:35:47,082
(How will we sleep tonight?)

2745
01:35:47,182 --> 01:35:48,581
I can't imagine how it will be.

2746
01:35:48,582 --> 01:35:50,282
I won't be able to sleep.

2747
01:35:50,682 --> 01:35:53,652
(Time left in the Cold Room)

2748
01:35:54,122 --> 01:35:56,652
(Cold Room, off)

2749
01:35:57,652 --> 01:35:58,891
Sang Uk wasn't able to go in at all.

2750
01:35:58,892 --> 01:36:00,521
I talked for 30 minutes,

2751
01:36:00,522 --> 01:36:02,022
but I didn't get a single one right.

2752
01:36:04,362 --> 01:36:05,431
Hello, everyone.

2753
01:36:05,432 --> 01:36:06,762
- Yes?
- Yes?

2754
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:08,932
- Please.
- Did you all enjoy the AC?

2755
01:36:09,732 --> 01:36:11,031
- Did we enjoy it?
- Yes.

2756
01:36:11,032 --> 01:36:12,132
The air conditioner?

2757
01:36:13,302 --> 01:36:15,272
- You all must feel hungry now.
- Right.

2758
01:36:15,542 --> 01:36:16,811
From now on, the group game...

2759
01:36:16,812 --> 01:36:19,441
for a Korean beef meal outside will happen.

2760
01:36:19,442 --> 01:36:20,611
- Does that mean we'll be leaving?
- Korean beef?

2761
01:36:20,612 --> 01:36:21,781
- You will be leaving.
- Korean beef?

2762
01:36:21,782 --> 01:36:23,381
- Air conditioner!
- Air conditioner!

2763
01:36:23,382 --> 01:36:25,011
We will begin right away once we gather at the yard.

2764
01:36:25,012 --> 01:36:26,151
- Okay.
- Please!

2765
01:36:26,152 --> 01:36:27,321
- I won't mess around.
- Come on.

2766
01:36:27,322 --> 01:36:29,282
This isn't an individual game. It's a group game.

2767
01:36:29,552 --> 01:36:30,592
All right.

2768
01:36:31,052 --> 01:36:33,062
The Korean beef expedition is here.

2769
01:36:33,522 --> 01:36:35,161
- What is this?
- What is this?

2770
01:36:35,162 --> 01:36:36,192
(What is this?)

2771
01:36:36,262 --> 01:36:38,191
You can see we have something placed on the floor.

2772
01:36:38,192 --> 01:36:39,301
- Right.
- What is that?

2773
01:36:39,302 --> 01:36:41,202
- There's a line and a square.
- Right.

2774
01:36:41,662 --> 01:36:43,972
Each of you must jump from the line...

2775
01:36:44,232 --> 01:36:46,242
to enter the square.

2776
01:36:46,572 --> 01:36:48,671
The goal is for all five of you to enter the square...

2777
01:36:48,672 --> 01:36:50,512
and stay together for five seconds.

2778
01:36:50,842 --> 01:36:53,082
- What? That looks easy.
- Hold on.

2779
01:36:53,182 --> 01:36:54,741
- We can't touch the line?
- You can't touch the line.

2780
01:36:54,742 --> 01:36:55,981
It has to be done like this?

2781
01:36:55,982 --> 01:36:57,211
- Give it a try.
- Give it a try.

2782
01:36:57,212 --> 01:36:58,581
- We can't do this. Give it a try.
- Gather up first.

2783
01:36:58,582 --> 01:36:59,722
Give it a try.

2784
01:37:00,552 --> 01:37:01,881
There's no room.

2785
01:37:01,882 --> 01:37:03,491
Join in, Sang Uk.

2786
01:37:03,492 --> 01:37:05,191
We have to hug the older ones tightly.

2787
01:37:05,192 --> 01:37:06,221
Is this possible?

2788
01:37:06,222 --> 01:37:07,322
Is this really possible?

2789
01:37:09,432 --> 01:37:10,831
- Time out.
- Hey!

2790
01:37:10,832 --> 01:37:11,931
(The square is too small for the Handsome Guys.)

2791
01:37:11,932 --> 01:37:13,231
- Time out.
- Hold on.

2792
01:37:13,232 --> 01:37:14,901
- Hold on.
- We can't do this.

2793
01:37:14,902 --> 01:37:15,931
As a plan,

2794
01:37:15,932 --> 01:37:18,052
should I get someone on my back after going in first?

2795
01:37:18,172 --> 01:37:19,742
Gosh.

2796
01:37:20,702 --> 01:37:21,941
Sang Uk can do that,

2797
01:37:21,942 --> 01:37:23,618
so he should block the others from falling out.

2798
01:37:23,642 --> 01:37:24,841
I'll stay at the back?

2799
01:37:24,842 --> 01:37:25,911
You should get in first...

2800
01:37:25,912 --> 01:37:27,111
and block the others.

2801
01:37:27,112 --> 01:37:28,112
No. We can never do this.

2802
01:37:28,113 --> 01:37:29,281
We can hold onto each other.

2803
01:37:29,282 --> 01:37:30,651
Stop saying that we can't do it.

2804
01:37:30,652 --> 01:37:32,621
- Think of ways that we can do it!
- Well,

2805
01:37:32,622 --> 01:37:34,021
- I'm always strict...
- Why say we won't be able to do it?

2806
01:37:34,022 --> 01:37:35,381
When it comes to games.

2807
01:37:35,382 --> 01:37:36,421
Let's give it a try.

2808
01:37:36,422 --> 01:37:38,151
I challenge myself if there's a 30 percent chance,

2809
01:37:38,152 --> 01:37:40,621
but we have less than 3 percent for this. No. It's 0 percent.

2810
01:37:40,622 --> 01:37:41,921
It must be this much bigger...

2811
01:37:41,922 --> 01:37:43,162
for us not to step on the line.

2812
01:37:44,132 --> 01:37:45,861
(Complaints grow...)

2813
01:37:45,862 --> 01:37:48,202
(along with distrust.)

2814
01:37:48,232 --> 01:37:49,932
(There's no unity in the group game.)

2815
01:37:50,102 --> 01:37:51,871
It will be hard to even get into the square.

2816
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:53,441
- Let's eat out.
- We can eat out.

2817
01:37:53,442 --> 01:37:54,502
Let's eat out.

2818
01:37:55,042 --> 01:37:57,111
- Time out. Hold on.
- We can't step on the line.

2819
01:37:57,112 --> 01:37:58,711
Why say we won't be able to do it?

2820
01:37:58,712 --> 01:37:59,712
This is...

2821
01:37:59,713 --> 01:38:01,107
(What will happen to the Handsome Guys?)

2822
01:38:01,131 --> 01:38:02,515
(The team game to get Korean beef and the air conditioner)

2823
01:38:02,516 --> 01:38:03,516
(Hugging)

2824
01:38:05,546 --> 01:38:07,986
(The five brothers' sticky summer night)

2825
01:38:08,516 --> 01:38:10,685
(Will they win the air conditioner?)

2826
01:38:10,686 --> 01:38:11,855
(And...)

2827
01:38:11,856 --> 01:38:12,885
(This is terrible!)

2828
01:38:12,886 --> 01:38:13,886
(Hurry up.)

2829
01:38:13,886 --> 01:38:14,886
(It's an emergency!)

2830
01:38:15,056 --> 01:38:16,556
(Drinking water disappears.)

2831
01:38:16,756 --> 01:38:18,395
(Even the sink tap doesn't run.)

2832
01:38:18,396 --> 01:38:19,725
(Bathroom)

2833
01:38:19,726 --> 01:38:21,666
(What's this? The toilet is strange too.)

2834
01:38:22,596 --> 01:38:24,135
(There's no water in the bathroom.)

2835
01:38:24,136 --> 01:38:25,735
(This time...)

2836
01:38:25,736 --> 01:38:26,805
(Is it a water shortage?)

2837
01:38:26,806 --> 01:38:28,665
(Yes)

2838
01:38:28,666 --> 01:38:30,335
(Tribe Handsome's second Life in Shortage)

2839
01:38:30,336 --> 01:38:32,236
(Shortage of water)

2840
01:38:32,376 --> 01:38:34,105
(You made us sweat so much.)

2841
01:38:34,106 --> 01:38:35,606
(1. Impossible to shower)

2842
01:38:35,816 --> 01:38:37,575
(We need water to cook.)

2843
01:38:37,576 --> 01:38:39,445
(2. Impossible to eat)

2844
01:38:39,446 --> 01:38:41,045
(They can't go to the bathroom.)

2845
01:38:41,046 --> 01:38:43,486
(3. Impossible to release)

2846
01:38:43,686 --> 01:38:45,155
(What kind of show is this?)

2847
01:38:45,156 --> 01:38:46,426
(Give me water!)

2848
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:48,585
(Is this a disaster show?)

2849
01:38:48,586 --> 01:38:51,025
(Save me.)

2850
01:38:51,026 --> 01:38:53,066
(Let's play a game to escape the shortage.)

2851
01:38:53,396 --> 01:38:55,996
(The war to escape the shortage never ends.)

2852
01:38:56,496 --> 01:38:57,596
One, two, three.

2853
01:38:58,766 --> 01:39:01,135
(I don't care as long as I escape.)

2854
01:39:01,136 --> 01:39:02,475
What should I do with this?

2855
01:39:02,476 --> 01:39:06,106
(Desperate struggles to escape)

2856
01:39:07,406 --> 01:39:08,906
(You're asking if it's bearable?)

2857
01:39:09,006 --> 01:39:10,016
(No!)

2858
01:39:10,416 --> 01:39:14,815
(Life in Shortage hits its limit.)

2859
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:16,756
(The world is turning.)

2860
01:39:18,516 --> 01:39:19,625
(Can we...)

2861
01:39:19,626 --> 01:39:22,826
(really escape?)

2862
