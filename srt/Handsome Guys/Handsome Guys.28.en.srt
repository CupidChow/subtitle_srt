1
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,215
(Is it tteokbokki...)

2
00:00:31,216 --> 00:00:32,916
(or chicken soup?)

3
00:00:33,356 --> 00:00:34,555
(Fish...)

4
00:00:34,556 --> 00:00:36,285
(or pork?)

5
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,286
(After making the choice...)

6
00:00:38,426 --> 00:00:42,125
(Exultation...)

7
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:43,966
(and regret)

8
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:45,666
(Anguish and resolution)

9
00:00:46,266 --> 00:00:49,106
(The time of abundance)

10
00:00:49,306 --> 00:00:51,465
(For modern people who suffer from such a dilemma)

11
00:00:51,466 --> 00:00:56,645
(The menu conflict agents, Handsome Guys)

12
00:00:56,646 --> 00:00:59,046
(It starts again today.)

13
00:00:59,776 --> 00:01:04,916
(The warm sunlight signals the arrival of summer.)

14
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:06,586
Come over quickly, everyone.

15
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:09,425
- He came early today, - Come quickly.

16
00:01:09,426 --> 00:01:11,825
- so he's trying to lead us.
- It's this way.

17
00:01:11,826 --> 00:01:12,895
(Dong Hyun, the leading instructor of Handsome Guys)

18
00:01:12,896 --> 00:01:14,496
He asked me to take him home.

19
00:01:14,626 --> 00:01:15,866
- In your dream?
- Yes.

20
00:01:15,996 --> 00:01:17,465
As soon as Seung Ho got here,

21
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:18,765
he told me that he saw Dong Hyun in his dream.

22
00:01:18,766 --> 00:01:19,935
- What was the dream about?
- What?

23
00:01:19,936 --> 00:01:21,865
I don't remember clearly what happened,

24
00:01:21,866 --> 00:01:23,165
but it was very uncomfortable.

25
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:27,106
He kept insisting that I take him to his house.

26
00:01:27,776 --> 00:01:30,205
I only slept three hours last night.

27
00:01:30,206 --> 00:01:32,575
- That's a bad dream.
- Yes.

28
00:01:32,576 --> 00:01:34,675
It seems like Dong Hyun keeps following Seung Ho.

29
00:01:34,676 --> 00:01:35,676
(Quietly)

30
00:01:35,677 --> 00:01:36,845
Dong Hyun. You know that, right?

31
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,085
- Last week...
- Last week was weak.

32
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:39,755
This week is strong.

33
00:01:39,756 --> 00:01:41,016
He paid two times last week.

34
00:01:41,286 --> 00:01:43,455
Do we have another guest today?

35
00:01:43,456 --> 00:01:45,925
Today's guest is someone I like.

36
00:01:45,926 --> 00:01:49,295
He's loved by many of our viewers.

37
00:01:49,296 --> 00:01:50,426
- Really?
- Yes.

38
00:01:50,566 --> 00:01:52,325
- Woo Il is here.
- Goodness.

39
00:01:52,326 --> 00:01:54,495
(Startled)

40
00:01:54,496 --> 00:01:57,805
- Woo Il is here.
- Goodness.

41
00:01:57,806 --> 00:01:58,905
When did you get here?

42
00:01:58,906 --> 00:02:00,706
(Chanting)

43
00:02:00,906 --> 00:02:02,105
- He's insane.
- When did you get here?

44
00:02:02,106 --> 00:02:03,476
Isn't he out of his mind?

45
00:02:03,876 --> 00:02:05,375
My goodness.

46
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:06,516
- You really startled me.
- What?

47
00:02:06,676 --> 00:02:08,745
- When did you go up there?
- He really startled me.

48
00:02:08,746 --> 00:02:10,145
I was very startled.

49
00:02:10,146 --> 00:02:11,886
He completely startled me.

50
00:02:12,046 --> 00:02:14,116
He's very determined these days.

51
00:02:14,286 --> 00:02:15,286
(Grunting)

52
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:16,926
(Don't climb up.)

53
00:02:16,926 --> 00:02:17,926
(Grunting)

54
00:02:18,926 --> 00:02:20,096
- Nice to meet you.
- Woo Il.

55
00:02:20,456 --> 00:02:22,565
(Comedian Im Woo Il, everyone's older brother)

56
00:02:22,566 --> 00:02:24,825
This is my first time on Handsome Guys.

57
00:02:24,826 --> 00:02:26,496
I'm Comedian Im Woo Il. Nice to meet you.

58
00:02:28,336 --> 00:02:30,165
He's very popular these days.

59
00:02:30,166 --> 00:02:31,166
Am I popular?

60
00:02:31,167 --> 00:02:32,735
- He's very popular.
- Very much so.

61
00:02:32,736 --> 00:02:34,675
I know him very well...

62
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:36,706
because I watch his YouTube videos every time I eat.

63
00:02:37,006 --> 00:02:39,275
It doesn't feel like we're meeting for the first time.

64
00:02:39,276 --> 00:02:41,146
- That's the case for everyone.
- On YouTube...

65
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:43,916
- People are wild about him.
- I'm his huge fan.

66
00:02:44,016 --> 00:02:46,286
Didn't you appear on "Amazing Saturday?"

67
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,486
No, I didn't.

68
00:02:49,326 --> 00:02:51,125
You didn't? I'm sorry.

69
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:52,555
I just wanted to ask.

70
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:54,455
(He embarrassed himself while pretending to know.)

71
00:02:54,456 --> 00:02:56,366
I spend many amazing Saturdays,

72
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:58,125
but I was never on "Amazing Saturday."

73
00:02:58,126 --> 00:02:59,195
It's their first time meeting.

74
00:02:59,196 --> 00:03:00,665
- You'll be invited soon.
- They met for the first time.

75
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:02,565
Woo Il looks...

76
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:04,336
young for his age.

77
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,006
He's the same age as Dong Hyun.

78
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:08,375
He's the same age as me, but he looks young?

79
00:03:08,376 --> 00:03:09,475
How so?

80
00:03:09,476 --> 00:03:10,476
(What is he talking about?)

81
00:03:10,477 --> 00:03:12,345
I think we're thinking the same...

82
00:03:12,346 --> 00:03:14,045
while looking at each other.

83
00:03:14,046 --> 00:03:15,345
- Are you married?
- No.

84
00:03:15,346 --> 00:03:16,985
- You aren't married?
- What's wrong with you?

85
00:03:16,986 --> 00:03:19,486
- Are you making fun of me?
- No, I'm sorry.

86
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:21,315
(Laughing)

87
00:03:21,316 --> 00:03:24,425
Do you know roughly what kind of show this is?

88
00:03:24,426 --> 00:03:26,396
- I watched a lot of it.
- I see.

89
00:03:26,656 --> 00:03:27,755
There's eating.

90
00:03:27,756 --> 00:03:29,826
You also play games.

91
00:03:29,866 --> 00:03:31,926
This is what made me think.

92
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:34,465
With your own card...

93
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:37,136
(You pay with your own card.)

94
00:03:37,406 --> 00:03:38,936
You usually play a character...

95
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:41,205
who's stingy.

96
00:03:41,206 --> 00:03:44,005
That's why I'm wondering how Woo Il came here.

97
00:03:44,006 --> 00:03:46,045
I heard that I wouldn't have to pay...

98
00:03:46,046 --> 00:03:47,145
- if I won the game.
- You just have to win.

99
00:03:47,146 --> 00:03:48,245
- Right.
- Yes.

100
00:03:48,246 --> 00:03:50,185
I imagine that...

101
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:51,345
when we play a game...

102
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:54,586
after the meal, you'll be extremely nervous.

103
00:03:54,756 --> 00:03:56,556
- I will do my best.
- You will?

104
00:03:56,586 --> 00:03:57,825
He will be...

105
00:03:57,826 --> 00:03:58,956
- beyond our imagination.
- Seriously.

106
00:03:59,396 --> 00:04:00,795
With 100 dollars on the line,

107
00:04:00,796 --> 00:04:02,496
I can spar against Dong Hyun.

108
00:04:03,626 --> 00:04:05,525
- That's the mindset I have.
- That's his attitude.

109
00:04:05,526 --> 00:04:07,696
I'll approach it with that mindset.

110
00:04:07,796 --> 00:04:09,965
Did you bring your own credit card?

111
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:11,365
- Yes, it's mine.
- Show me.

112
00:04:11,366 --> 00:04:12,576
Didn't you bring a different card?

113
00:04:13,236 --> 00:04:14,535
- Show me.
- Or a corporate card?

114
00:04:14,536 --> 00:04:16,375
I'm over 40 years old.

115
00:04:16,376 --> 00:04:18,706
- I have a card of my own.
- But...

116
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,646
If we get to eat a meal...

117
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,645
bought by Woo Il today,

118
00:04:23,646 --> 00:04:24,845
it'll be worth noting...

119
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:26,515
- in our diary.
- Today could be rare.

120
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,756
It will be very rare.

121
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:29,625
- Today could be rare.
- It's very rare.

122
00:04:29,626 --> 00:04:31,985
Today, we're in Sindang-dong.

123
00:04:31,986 --> 00:04:33,925
Woo Il, do you have any stories about Sindang-dong?

124
00:04:33,926 --> 00:04:36,266
Sindang-dong is known for tteokbokki.

125
00:04:36,396 --> 00:04:37,396
(Sindang Station)

126
00:04:37,396 --> 00:04:38,396
(Dongmyo Station, Sangwangsimni Station)

127
00:04:38,397 --> 00:04:40,036
(Sindang Station)

128
00:04:41,296 --> 00:04:42,765
Do you know why it's called Sindang?

129
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:43,766
- Why?
- What?

130
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,365
- It's Sindang.
- "Sindang?"

131
00:04:45,366 --> 00:04:46,375
- Getting your fortune read...
- There are shrines...

132
00:04:46,376 --> 00:04:47,376
devoted to the spirits.

133
00:04:47,376 --> 00:04:48,376
- Really?
- Are there many?

134
00:04:48,377 --> 00:04:49,845
- That's why.
- Because there are many?

135
00:04:49,846 --> 00:04:51,145
There are many in the area.

136
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:53,045
(And Tteokbokki Street that can't be excluded)

137
00:04:53,046 --> 00:04:55,015
(Tteokbokki)

138
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:56,785
(Many tteokbokki restaurants to choose from)

139
00:04:56,786 --> 00:04:58,286
(For tteokbokki, it's Sindang-dong.)

140
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:01,456
These days, it's called Hipdang-dong.

141
00:05:02,516 --> 00:05:05,725
(In Sindang-dong that's lively with people, )

142
00:05:05,726 --> 00:05:07,795
(what will Handsome Guys recommend?)

143
00:05:07,796 --> 00:05:10,966
I did some research on today's restaurants.

144
00:05:11,096 --> 00:05:14,066
We all know that Sindang-dong is known for its tteokbokki.

145
00:05:14,096 --> 00:05:17,065
We'll go to a famous tteokbokki restaurant.

146
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,766
Yes, we have to eat some tteokbokki here.

147
00:05:18,906 --> 00:05:21,205
That restaurant is also known for its chicken feet.

148
00:05:21,206 --> 00:05:22,306
I see.

149
00:05:22,976 --> 00:05:25,805
(A generous portion of toppings...)

150
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:29,516
(and chewy wheat cake tteokbokki)

151
00:05:29,716 --> 00:05:32,786
(And spicy chicken feet, which would be disappointing not to eat)

152
00:05:33,086 --> 00:05:36,785
(Addicting chicken feet and tteokbokki)

153
00:05:36,786 --> 00:05:38,156
The other restaurant sells...

154
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:40,296
my comfort food.

155
00:05:40,656 --> 00:05:42,595
- It's braised chicken.
- Braised chicken?

156
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:44,226
However, it's North Korean-style.

157
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:45,466
- North Korean-style?
- North Korean-style?

158
00:05:47,036 --> 00:05:49,536
(The meeting of light chicken and spring onions)

159
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:53,875
(Lightly salted and attractive North Korean-style braised chicken)

160
00:05:53,876 --> 00:05:55,935
(Today's LMR)

161
00:05:55,936 --> 00:06:00,046
(Sindang-dong tteokbokki versus North Korean-style braised chicken)

162
00:06:00,316 --> 00:06:01,445
What should I do?

163
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:02,846
It's hard to decide.

164
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,546
I know this chicken feet restaurant.

165
00:06:05,846 --> 00:06:07,815
- The food is a bit spicy.
- It's spicy?

166
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:09,955
I pick braised chicken without thinking twice.

167
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:12,186
I can't eat spicy food either.

168
00:06:12,386 --> 00:06:14,696
- So I'll pick braised chicken.
- What should I do?

169
00:06:15,096 --> 00:06:16,995
I rarely get a chance...

170
00:06:16,996 --> 00:06:18,525
to eat tteokbokki in Sindang-dong.

171
00:06:18,526 --> 00:06:19,636
I can't eat spicy food either,

172
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:21,835
but I'd like to try tteokbokki in Sindang-dong.

173
00:06:21,836 --> 00:06:23,005
That's a great idea.

174
00:06:23,006 --> 00:06:24,306
I pick tteokbokki.

175
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:26,006
I'd like braised chicken.

176
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:28,006
- And it's North Korean-style.
- Braised chicken?

177
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:29,306
I like bland food.

178
00:06:29,476 --> 00:06:31,376
It's hard for me to decide.

179
00:06:31,806 --> 00:06:34,615
(My head hurts.)

180
00:06:34,616 --> 00:06:35,776
I pick tteokbokki.

181
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:37,086
- Why?
- Tteokbokki?

182
00:06:37,816 --> 00:06:38,846
I don't know why.

183
00:06:39,416 --> 00:06:41,785
- You feel drawn by it?
- I'm leaning in that direction.

184
00:06:41,786 --> 00:06:43,285
(Seung Ho is more drawn to tteokbokki.)

185
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:44,855
I'll also get tteokbokki.

186
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:45,925
You pick tteokbokki?

187
00:06:45,926 --> 00:06:47,725
Seung Ho, Tae Hyun, and Dong Hyun will eat...

188
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:49,966
tteokbokki and chicken feet in Sindang-dong.

189
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,195
Woo Il, Yi Kyung, and Sang Uk will eat...

190
00:06:52,196 --> 00:06:54,136
braised chicken in Sindang-dong.

191
00:06:54,396 --> 00:06:56,366
- Yi Kyung will eat for free today.
- I won't pay.

192
00:06:56,606 --> 00:06:58,066
- That's amazing.
- How so?

193
00:06:58,206 --> 00:06:59,776
- Why do you say that?
- Why?

194
00:06:59,976 --> 00:07:03,245
It looks like he's with Dumb and Dumber.

195
00:07:03,246 --> 00:07:04,745
(Dumb and Dumber)

196
00:07:04,746 --> 00:07:06,575
Where are we going now?

197
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:08,446
This is the most important. Which food will we get first?

198
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:11,185
You'll eat tteokbokki that Sindang-dong is known for.

199
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:12,285
- Yes.
- Okay.

200
00:07:12,286 --> 00:07:13,485
I knew it.

201
00:07:13,486 --> 00:07:14,486
We got it.

202
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:15,556
(Let's get Sindang-dong tteokbokki.)

203
00:07:15,716 --> 00:07:17,025
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

204
00:07:17,026 --> 00:07:18,086
I can't wait.

205
00:07:18,426 --> 00:07:20,255
It's a very famous place in Sindang-dong.

206
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:21,826
(They go to taste spicy tteokbokki.)

207
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:24,396
Gosh, it's hot.

208
00:07:24,596 --> 00:07:25,666
(Exclaiming)

209
00:07:26,636 --> 00:07:28,266
- What's this?
- Goodness.

210
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:30,036
- There is...
- It's my first time here.

211
00:07:30,136 --> 00:07:32,265
- It's been 72 years.
- Food Street.

212
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:34,175
This entire street must be covered with restaurants.

213
00:07:34,176 --> 00:07:36,106
There are so many.

214
00:07:36,746 --> 00:07:37,946
The signboards are huge.

215
00:07:38,176 --> 00:07:39,445
They all sell tteokbokki.

216
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:41,345
I can smell tteokbokki on the street.

217
00:07:41,346 --> 00:07:42,916
Don't you smell the tteokbokki sauce?

218
00:07:43,216 --> 00:07:44,286
This is amazing.

219
00:07:45,546 --> 00:07:47,315
Didn't instant tteokbokki...

220
00:07:47,316 --> 00:07:48,785
- originate from here?
- Right.

221
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:50,085
- You cook it on the spot.
- Right.

222
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:51,856
You can also add ramyeon.

223
00:07:52,386 --> 00:07:53,996
- Here it is.
- Where?

224
00:07:55,256 --> 00:07:56,295
"Tteokbokki and chicken feet?"

225
00:07:56,296 --> 00:07:57,866
This place looks old too.

226
00:07:58,226 --> 00:07:59,566
- It's here.
- It will be spicy.

227
00:08:00,266 --> 00:08:01,336
Hello.

228
00:08:04,806 --> 00:08:08,836
(The place is crowded even though it's early for lunch.)

229
00:08:09,876 --> 00:08:16,016
(A tasty restaurant in Sindang-dong where you must wait)

230
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:20,756
(Beyond the typical Korean snack food)

231
00:08:21,956 --> 00:08:24,685
(A popular restaurant stimulating the palate all over the world)

232
00:08:24,686 --> 00:08:28,126
(It has become a must-visit restaurant for tourists.)

233
00:08:32,966 --> 00:08:37,436
(LMR 1, tteokbokki and chicken feet)

234
00:08:38,266 --> 00:08:40,435
Did you see them on the first floor?

235
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,435
- Aren't they called basins?
- Yes.

236
00:08:42,436 --> 00:08:44,446
There were piles of chicken feet.

237
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:46,315
(As soon as they entered the restaurant a moment ago)

238
00:08:46,316 --> 00:08:47,575
- The smell.
- Go upstairs.

239
00:08:47,576 --> 00:08:48,775
Hello.

240
00:08:48,776 --> 00:08:49,786
Look at this.

241
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:51,285
- The smell.
- Unbelievable.

242
00:08:51,286 --> 00:08:53,215
(Handsome Guys face a surprising sight.)

243
00:08:53,216 --> 00:08:54,455
Do you sell this much chicken feet?

244
00:08:54,456 --> 00:08:56,225
The smell is amazing.

245
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:57,285
(It's chicken feet in the broth.)

246
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,986
Chicken feet...

247
00:08:59,226 --> 00:09:01,495
- Do you eat chicken feet?
- I usually don't.

248
00:09:01,496 --> 00:09:02,625
- Me neither.
- Oh, no.

249
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,025
- I don't eat them.
- Their chicken feet come in broth.

250
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:05,125
(Team Chicken Feet don't eat chicken feet.)

251
00:09:05,126 --> 00:09:06,236
The broth...

252
00:09:06,596 --> 00:09:07,795
They have to eat chicken feet.

253
00:09:07,796 --> 00:09:10,735
Their chicken feet are served in a broth.

254
00:09:10,736 --> 00:09:11,736
Chicken feet in broth?

255
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:13,706
Order some chicken feet and tteokbokki separately.

256
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:14,906
I don't want any.

257
00:09:16,776 --> 00:09:18,005
I can't eat chicken feet.

258
00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:20,116
- Then why did you pick this place?
- I came here for tteokbokki.

259
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:21,675
Their chicken feet are to die for.

260
00:09:21,676 --> 00:09:23,115
I only saw chicken feet in the restaurant.

261
00:09:23,116 --> 00:09:24,986
There are 2 or 3 high schools nearby.

262
00:09:25,116 --> 00:09:26,315
All the students come here to eat chicken feet.

263
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:27,385
- High school students?
- Really?

264
00:09:27,386 --> 00:09:28,786
They're too young to eat chicken feet.

265
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:30,686
How did they end up eating them?

266
00:09:31,586 --> 00:09:33,855
- Hello.
- He must be the owner's son.

267
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:35,725
Please come this way.

268
00:09:35,726 --> 00:09:37,025
- Are you the owner's son?
- Yes.

269
00:09:37,026 --> 00:09:38,195
(The 2nd generation owner, Yoo Dong Hoon)

270
00:09:38,196 --> 00:09:40,395
Did your parents start running the restaurant?

271
00:09:40,396 --> 00:09:41,635
How long has it been?

272
00:09:41,636 --> 00:09:43,666
My mother has been running it for 25 years.

273
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:45,706
I've been running it for 15 years.

274
00:09:46,106 --> 00:09:47,775
That's quite a long time.

275
00:09:47,776 --> 00:09:49,075
You must have started at a young age.

276
00:09:49,076 --> 00:09:50,676
Did you start when you were a teenager?

277
00:09:50,746 --> 00:09:52,176
No, I was in my 20s.

278
00:09:52,376 --> 00:09:53,815
- But your age...
- You look very young.

279
00:09:53,816 --> 00:09:55,416
- I'm in my 40s.
- What?

280
00:09:56,286 --> 00:09:57,415
You look very young for your age.

281
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:58,845
- You're in your 40s?
- What year were you born?

282
00:09:58,846 --> 00:09:59,916
I was born in 1985.

283
00:10:00,156 --> 00:10:01,355
You just turned 40.

284
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:02,656
You're 41 years old.

285
00:10:02,756 --> 00:10:03,756
You look so young for your age.

286
00:10:03,757 --> 00:10:04,986
You must have eaten a lot of chicken feet.

287
00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:06,455
- That's right.
- It's full of collagen.

288
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:07,596
You don't look your age.

289
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:09,455
Here's what I noticed on the first floor.

290
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:12,125
I've never seen so many chicken feet in my life.

291
00:10:12,126 --> 00:10:13,636
Will you be selling all those chicken feet today?

292
00:10:13,866 --> 00:10:16,035
Yes, we'll sell them this morning.

293
00:10:16,036 --> 00:10:17,036
- This morning?
- This morning?

294
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:18,135
- Just the morning?
- Yes.

295
00:10:18,136 --> 00:10:19,906
How many basins are there downstairs?

296
00:10:20,076 --> 00:10:21,705
- There are about 30.
- Gosh.

297
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:22,735
It looks like...

298
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:25,076
all the chicken feet in Korea are here.

299
00:10:25,176 --> 00:10:26,346
There are so many.

300
00:10:27,216 --> 00:10:28,615
My mother is...

301
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:30,885
also good at cooking chicken feet.

302
00:10:30,886 --> 00:10:33,685
She ran a chicken feet restaurant a long time ago.

303
00:10:33,686 --> 00:10:35,215
When you cook chicken feet for too long,

304
00:10:35,216 --> 00:10:36,585
they get soft and break.

305
00:10:36,586 --> 00:10:38,185
It ruins the texture.

306
00:10:38,186 --> 00:10:40,125
- The cooking time is important.
- That's right.

307
00:10:40,126 --> 00:10:41,825
When you cook them beyond a certain point,

308
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:43,765
- they break.
- Exactly. They break.

309
00:10:43,766 --> 00:10:45,995
- Even the bones break.
- We stop cooking them right before.

310
00:10:45,996 --> 00:10:47,165
(Fascinated)

311
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,566
To be honest, I don't like chicken feet.

312
00:10:49,636 --> 00:10:52,106
I only had them a few times.

313
00:10:52,206 --> 00:10:53,576
However, I'd like to try them here.

314
00:10:53,706 --> 00:10:56,606
- I'm curious.
- We should get some mild ones.

315
00:10:56,746 --> 00:10:58,306
I'm really curious.

316
00:10:58,946 --> 00:10:59,975
First of all,

317
00:10:59,976 --> 00:11:02,915
we can't eat a lot of spicy food.

318
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:05,445
We'll order one mildly spicy chicken feet.

319
00:11:05,446 --> 00:11:06,955
How many portions of tteokbokki should we get?

320
00:11:06,956 --> 00:11:08,155
- Tteokbokki...
- For three people.

321
00:11:08,156 --> 00:11:09,316
- For three people.
- Okay.

322
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,786
- How many eggs are in 1 order?
- There are 2.

323
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:13,526
Can we get ten of these?

324
00:11:13,926 --> 00:11:15,625
Wait, Dong Hyun.

325
00:11:15,626 --> 00:11:17,325
For our protein for the day,

326
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:19,065
- we'll drink protein shakes later.
- Really?

327
00:11:19,066 --> 00:11:20,095
I'd like to include...

328
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,796
sundae in our order.

329
00:11:22,436 --> 00:11:23,665
- Sundae sounds good.
- That sounds good.

330
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,036
- Sundae sounds good.
- We can mix it in the sauce.

331
00:11:25,206 --> 00:11:26,476
There they go again.

332
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,536
- Let's get sundae.
- Definitely.

333
00:11:28,576 --> 00:11:30,075
Sundae sounds great.

334
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:32,275
- Sundae and six eggs.
- That's good.

335
00:11:32,276 --> 00:11:34,415
Six eggs? And...

336
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,485
- can we also get wieners?
- Won't that be 12 eggs?

337
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:37,986
It's coming right up.

338
00:11:38,046 --> 00:11:39,955
- And rice balls...
- "And?"

339
00:11:39,956 --> 00:11:40,986
"And?"

340
00:11:41,016 --> 00:11:42,656
We'll get an order of flying fish roe rice balls.

341
00:11:43,026 --> 00:11:44,325
Tteokbokki and...

342
00:11:44,326 --> 00:11:46,696
Are you going home just after one meal?

343
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:49,255
- We usually eat about this much.
- Really?

344
00:11:49,256 --> 00:11:50,395
Okay. One order of chicken feet.

345
00:11:50,396 --> 00:11:52,065
- Just bring us what you remember.
- Okay.

346
00:11:52,066 --> 00:11:53,296
Thank you.

347
00:11:53,436 --> 00:11:55,865
You ordered almost everything that's on the menu.

348
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:58,035
- We're much calmer than usual.
- Right.

349
00:11:58,036 --> 00:11:59,205
- Seriously.
- Otherwise, we're in trouble.

350
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:00,436
That's right.

351
00:12:01,036 --> 00:12:02,805
(The order comes in quickly.)

352
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,476
- Please serve that side only.
- Please put it on this side.

353
00:12:05,276 --> 00:12:06,775
(Less spicy chicken feet)

354
00:12:06,776 --> 00:12:09,116
It comes out as an assorted dish.

355
00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:11,286
It's a lot for three people.

356
00:12:11,786 --> 00:12:14,855
- What's this?
- You have to make it yourself.

357
00:12:14,856 --> 00:12:16,426
- I'll make it, Tae Hyun.
- Okay.

358
00:12:17,926 --> 00:12:19,926
The chicken feet...

359
00:12:20,326 --> 00:12:23,366
Have I ever tried chicken feet?

360
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:25,525
(An unfamiliar sight to those who haven't tried them)

361
00:12:25,526 --> 00:12:26,865
I must have had them a few times.

362
00:12:26,866 --> 00:12:28,296
(An unfamiliar sight to those who haven't tried them)

363
00:12:28,396 --> 00:12:30,135
Why is the chicken foot...

364
00:12:30,136 --> 00:12:31,236
(He musters up the courage as the eldest member.)

365
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:33,376
Tae Hyun feels awkward around the chicken feet.

366
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:36,036
Chicken feet are eaten for the fun of deboning them in your mouth.

367
00:12:36,106 --> 00:12:37,576
It looks like it's cursing at me.

368
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,276
(Laughing)

369
00:12:41,516 --> 00:12:42,776
Do I eat it all in one bite?

370
00:12:43,016 --> 00:12:45,486
Usually, I scrape it off and debone it.

371
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:47,056
Munch on it.

372
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:48,585
(Munch?)

373
00:12:48,586 --> 00:12:49,926
What I do is...

374
00:12:50,486 --> 00:12:51,625
(It comes off.)

375
00:12:51,626 --> 00:12:52,826
What? Where did it go?

376
00:12:53,626 --> 00:12:55,456
- Don't they have bones?
- They do.

377
00:12:55,526 --> 00:12:57,165
Debone it inside your mouth.

378
00:12:57,166 --> 00:12:58,926
Then spit out the bones.

379
00:13:00,236 --> 00:13:01,236
It's mostly bones.

380
00:13:01,237 --> 00:13:03,735
(Spitting them out awkwardly)

381
00:13:03,736 --> 00:13:05,335
It's up to you.

382
00:13:05,336 --> 00:13:07,076
Suck on it.

383
00:13:07,976 --> 00:13:09,135
Inside your mouth...

384
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:10,246
(Humming)

385
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:12,206
- I can taste the bones.
- It's all bones.

386
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:15,575
(This time, Seung Ho tastes it.)

387
00:13:15,576 --> 00:13:16,786
It's not spicy.

388
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:18,316
This is it.

389
00:13:18,686 --> 00:13:19,756
It's all bones.

390
00:13:21,286 --> 00:13:22,616
Is it slightly spicy?

391
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:23,955
It has just the right amount of spice.

392
00:13:23,956 --> 00:13:26,086
- It's hard to stop eating.
- You're right.

393
00:13:26,326 --> 00:13:27,926
The chicken feet look delicious.

394
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:30,795
This part is delicious.

395
00:13:30,796 --> 00:13:31,796
It's not spicy.

396
00:13:31,797 --> 00:13:34,766
- The meat on this part.
- It's nice and tender.

397
00:13:34,966 --> 00:13:35,995
(Exclaiming)

398
00:13:35,996 --> 00:13:37,865
- It's delicious.
- The chicken feet...

399
00:13:37,866 --> 00:13:39,976
Tae Hyun is eating a lot of them.

400
00:13:40,136 --> 00:13:41,805
- It's delicious.
- I agree.

401
00:13:41,806 --> 00:13:43,146
The restaurant where I had them...

402
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,275
I'm serious.

403
00:13:45,276 --> 00:13:48,075
The chicken feet I had last time must have been bad.

404
00:13:48,076 --> 00:13:49,145
These are good.

405
00:13:49,146 --> 00:13:51,785
- The seasoning is somewhat...
- You're right.

406
00:13:51,786 --> 00:13:54,716
- addicting.
- The seasoning is really...

407
00:13:55,086 --> 00:13:56,315
They have no bad odor either.

408
00:13:56,316 --> 00:13:57,686
I understand why these are popular here.

409
00:13:58,326 --> 00:13:59,855
It's uncomfortable to look at them.

410
00:13:59,856 --> 00:14:01,026
I have to eat without looking at them.

411
00:14:01,656 --> 00:14:04,226
You seem to stare at them before eating.

412
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:05,465
I'm trying to get used to it.

413
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:06,765
(I want to get closer to you.)

414
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:09,065
(Jealous)

415
00:14:09,066 --> 00:14:10,905
- Gosh, that looks delicious.
- I know very well...

416
00:14:10,906 --> 00:14:12,935
how delicious chicken feet are.

417
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:16,135
However, deboning them can be tiring.

418
00:14:16,136 --> 00:14:17,375
- The work...
- That's bothersome.

419
00:14:17,376 --> 00:14:18,445
Because it's bothersome?

420
00:14:18,446 --> 00:14:21,316
- The taste makes you overcome it.
- Of course.

421
00:14:22,076 --> 00:14:24,045
- It makes my mouth water.
- I agree.

422
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:25,485
The sight of it makes my mouth water.

423
00:14:25,486 --> 00:14:27,486
You're right. My mouth is watering too.

424
00:14:28,386 --> 00:14:34,656
(The irresistible charm of chicken feet)

425
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:36,866
They're disappearing fast.

426
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:38,295
The chicken feet are disappearing.

427
00:14:38,296 --> 00:14:39,935
(The chicken feet are disappearing fast.)

428
00:14:39,936 --> 00:14:42,465
I want some tteokbokki now,

429
00:14:42,466 --> 00:14:44,666
but I'm eating chicken feet in case they disappear.

430
00:14:45,106 --> 00:14:46,876
They keep disappearing.

431
00:14:47,176 --> 00:14:48,506
I'll move on to tteokbokki after finishing these.

432
00:14:48,536 --> 00:14:50,605
Dong Hyun, you said that you didn't like chicken feet.

433
00:14:50,606 --> 00:14:52,145
I don't like them, but...

434
00:14:52,146 --> 00:14:53,415
(Giggling)

435
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:54,576
I don't like them, but...

436
00:14:56,616 --> 00:14:57,716
I don't like them, but...

437
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,916
Aren't they good?

438
00:15:00,456 --> 00:15:03,186
There's a reason why their chicken feet are famous.

439
00:15:04,386 --> 00:15:06,625
Now I understand why you said the palm tasted good.

440
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:08,956
- You can tell, can't you?
- That part is quite meaty.

441
00:15:09,056 --> 00:15:10,525
I thought that we'd get to eat the chicken feet..

442
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:11,626
Because they wouldn't finish them.

443
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,235
Seriously. That's exactly what I thought.

444
00:15:13,236 --> 00:15:15,235
- The chicken feet...
- They're disappearing first.

445
00:15:15,236 --> 00:15:16,606
All of them said that they hated chicken feet.

446
00:15:16,636 --> 00:15:18,435
I know. It's hard to believe it.

447
00:15:18,436 --> 00:15:20,336
I really don't like them. What's wrong with me?

448
00:15:20,806 --> 00:15:23,276
- It's strange.
- It's ready to eat now.

449
00:15:23,946 --> 00:15:25,376
It disappears like this.

450
00:15:25,506 --> 00:15:26,716
Dong Hyun.

451
00:15:27,316 --> 00:15:28,316
Right.

452
00:15:28,317 --> 00:15:29,446
Help yourself.

453
00:15:30,046 --> 00:15:31,646
Dong Hyun likes chicken feet.

454
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,315
(The noodles are turning chewy and bouncy.)

455
00:15:35,316 --> 00:15:37,725
- Eat the noodles first.
- It has the basic taste.

456
00:15:37,726 --> 00:15:40,855
- Look, it's jjolmyeon.
- It's jjolmyeon.

457
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,025
Tae Hyun.

458
00:15:42,026 --> 00:15:43,696
- I haven't seen that in a while.
- Tae Hyun.

459
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:45,126
Time-out.

460
00:15:45,726 --> 00:15:47,465
- Tae Hyun.
- What is it?

461
00:15:47,466 --> 00:15:48,796
Time-out.

462
00:15:49,036 --> 00:15:50,535
- Go ahead and eat.
- What's wrong?

463
00:15:50,536 --> 00:15:53,876
(You can't take all the delicious jjolmyeon.)

464
00:15:54,206 --> 00:15:55,805
- Because I took it all?
- Have some.

465
00:15:55,806 --> 00:15:57,346
Put your plate up close.

466
00:15:57,376 --> 00:15:59,075
I thought that I caused a lot of trouble.

467
00:15:59,076 --> 00:16:00,275
- This is...
- Tae Hyun doesn't eat much.

468
00:16:00,276 --> 00:16:01,646
In this case...

469
00:16:01,716 --> 00:16:04,115
All the glass noodles were on one side.

470
00:16:04,116 --> 00:16:05,815
- I wasn't aware of it.
- Right.

471
00:16:05,816 --> 00:16:07,915
Instead of mixing them...

472
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,185
Dong Hyun, hold up your plate.

473
00:16:09,186 --> 00:16:10,325
No, it's okay.

474
00:16:10,326 --> 00:16:11,626
All right, I'll serve myself.

475
00:16:13,456 --> 00:16:15,295
The jjolmyeon topping...

476
00:16:15,296 --> 00:16:18,396
(Finally tasting the jjolmyeon)

477
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:20,636
Yes, jjolmyeon.

478
00:16:20,796 --> 00:16:21,836
What is it?

479
00:16:21,866 --> 00:16:22,895
Really?

480
00:16:22,896 --> 00:16:24,305
(An automatic thumbs-up)

481
00:16:24,306 --> 00:16:25,706
Surprisingly, Tae Hyun...

482
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:27,906
Dong Hyun is only eating chicken feet.

483
00:16:28,836 --> 00:16:29,905
I'm sorry, but they're so good.

484
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,276
You won't get to eat any jjolmyeon.

485
00:16:31,906 --> 00:16:34,115
- This is addicting.
- He definitely said he hated them.

486
00:16:34,116 --> 00:16:35,476
He might take some to go.

487
00:16:35,676 --> 00:16:38,285
I'm going to eat chicken feet and jjolmyeon together.

488
00:16:38,286 --> 00:16:39,415
(In love with jjolmyeon)

489
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,585
- Do you mean the sauce?
- Yes.

490
00:16:40,586 --> 00:16:42,286
This will definitely taste good.

491
00:16:43,056 --> 00:16:44,456
There's no more jjolmyeon for you.

492
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:47,995
Tae Hyun definitely said that he wasn't hungry.

493
00:16:47,996 --> 00:16:48,996
(Humming)

494
00:16:49,296 --> 00:16:50,665
- And...
- My mouth keeps watering.

495
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:51,825
Shall I add the sundae?

496
00:16:51,826 --> 00:16:52,826
You definitely should.

497
00:16:52,827 --> 00:16:54,035
Should I add half of it?

498
00:16:54,036 --> 00:16:56,166
- Be careful not to add salt.
- From the back...

499
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,865
- Are you adding all?
- I'll add these first.

500
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:00,436
Shouldn't we eat the sundae separately?

501
00:17:00,506 --> 00:17:01,636
Mix them in the sauce.

502
00:17:02,036 --> 00:17:03,976
It's delicious when dipped in salt.

503
00:17:04,046 --> 00:17:06,405
That will become tastier as they get cooked.

504
00:17:06,406 --> 00:17:07,445
Right.

505
00:17:07,446 --> 00:17:08,745
Seriously.

506
00:17:08,746 --> 00:17:11,586
(Sundae is coming soon.)

507
00:17:12,086 --> 00:17:14,285
- Are noodles famous in Daejeon?
- Kalguksu...

508
00:17:14,286 --> 00:17:16,286
(Dong Hyun, the chicken feet lover, is about to eat some ramyeon.)

509
00:17:16,456 --> 00:17:17,556
You know what?

510
00:17:18,126 --> 00:17:20,055
Cut the egg in half.

511
00:17:20,056 --> 00:17:21,625
Eat it with the chicken feet sauce.

512
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:22,996
- That sounds delicious.
- It'd be good.

513
00:17:23,726 --> 00:17:25,196
That sounds delicious.

514
00:17:25,226 --> 00:17:26,965
When Woo Il is talking to you,

515
00:17:26,966 --> 00:17:28,596
- you should look at him.
- Let me try that after this.

516
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,665
Dong Hyun subtly dislikes people...

517
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:31,806
his own age.

518
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:33,106
- That's not true.
- Really?

519
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,775
- I like...
- Is it necessary to dislike them?

520
00:17:34,776 --> 00:17:36,036
I like them.

521
00:17:36,076 --> 00:17:37,246
Why would I dislike them?

522
00:17:37,376 --> 00:17:38,775
You told him to try it.

523
00:17:38,776 --> 00:17:40,115
Cut the egg in half.

524
00:17:40,116 --> 00:17:41,745
Cut it in half?

525
00:17:41,746 --> 00:17:43,415
Yes, cut it in half.

526
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,116
- Mix with the chicken feet sauce.
- And the egg yolk?

527
00:17:45,186 --> 00:17:47,186
- Yes, mix with the egg yolk.
- You mix it with the sauce.

528
00:17:47,286 --> 00:17:49,156
(Exclaiming)

529
00:17:49,686 --> 00:17:50,925
This won't work.

530
00:17:50,926 --> 00:17:52,385
Yes, it should go in.

531
00:17:52,386 --> 00:17:54,856
(Dong Hyun takes an egg and cuts it in half.)

532
00:17:54,896 --> 00:17:56,725
You told me to try it this way.

533
00:17:56,726 --> 00:17:58,895
Gosh, that looks amazing.

534
00:17:58,896 --> 00:18:00,595
This will be good.

535
00:18:00,596 --> 00:18:02,296
- It will definitely taste good.
- It also has protein.

536
00:18:03,906 --> 00:18:06,306
(Glancing)

537
00:18:07,306 --> 00:18:08,505
It's delicious.

538
00:18:08,506 --> 00:18:09,736
(It's delicious.)

539
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:14,215
Woo Il, just let it go.

540
00:18:14,216 --> 00:18:16,076
- It's really delicious.
- Let it go.

541
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:17,616
It's very good.

542
00:18:18,186 --> 00:18:20,316
He told me a good way to enjoy it.

543
00:18:20,756 --> 00:18:23,086
(Gulping)

544
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,755
The chicken feet sauce goes with anything.

545
00:18:24,756 --> 00:18:25,926
It's not that spicy.

546
00:18:26,086 --> 00:18:27,796
- It's sweet and spicy.
- Sweet and spicy?

547
00:18:28,026 --> 00:18:29,126
It's sweet and spicy.

548
00:18:29,556 --> 00:18:33,866
(Let's fully enjoy the tteokbokki.)

549
00:18:37,536 --> 00:18:38,706
It's really good.

550
00:18:40,436 --> 00:18:44,676
(The essence of tteokbokki is the rice cakes.)

551
00:18:44,776 --> 00:18:46,646
I want to eat it with a spoon.

552
00:18:47,446 --> 00:18:48,875
(Planning to eat some broth)

553
00:18:48,876 --> 00:18:51,286
You enjoy it with the broth.

554
00:18:51,986 --> 00:18:53,285
It looks incredibly good.

555
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:55,416
My mouth is watering so much.

556
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:58,556
You're supposed to eat it with the broth.

557
00:18:58,726 --> 00:19:00,755
(Staring)

558
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:02,056
With the broth.

559
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:06,365
- Just let it go.
- Is it good?

560
00:19:06,366 --> 00:19:08,465
(Woo Il, you should let it go.)

561
00:19:08,466 --> 00:19:10,105
- It's much tastier.
- Is it?

562
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:11,705
- With the broth?
- With the broth.

563
00:19:11,706 --> 00:19:12,866
(It's much tastier.)

564
00:19:13,266 --> 00:19:15,705
- You must like tteokbokki.
- Yes.

565
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:17,706
- You also like chicken feet.
- This is nice.

566
00:19:19,676 --> 00:19:20,976
It's a fried dumpling.

567
00:19:22,216 --> 00:19:23,446
May I eat one dumpling?

568
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:25,246
(Tteokbokki is enjoyed in various ways according to one's taste)

569
00:19:25,746 --> 00:19:29,155
We should use a spoon to eat it with the broth.

570
00:19:29,156 --> 00:19:30,256
This is...

571
00:19:30,926 --> 00:19:32,126
This is great.

572
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:39,266
- You like noodles and chicken feet.
- Yes.

573
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:40,365
It's very delicious.

574
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:42,036
(Eating a piece of sundae that he put in tteokbokki earlier)

575
00:19:42,636 --> 00:19:44,465
- This is really good.
- With the sauce...

576
00:19:44,466 --> 00:19:45,506
(Impressed)

577
00:19:45,606 --> 00:19:47,075
There's always a reason why...

578
00:19:47,076 --> 00:19:48,836
Seung Ho adds things to the dish.

579
00:19:49,206 --> 00:19:50,505
I didn't understand why he added sundae.

580
00:19:50,506 --> 00:19:51,705
It's delicious.

581
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:52,946
(It's delicious.)

582
00:19:53,246 --> 00:19:55,116
You should always follow what Seung Ho says.

583
00:19:55,316 --> 00:19:59,086
People think that Sang Uk and I are simply big eaters,

584
00:19:59,216 --> 00:20:00,655
- but more importantly, - Goodness.

585
00:20:00,656 --> 00:20:01,656
- we're gourmands.
- You're gourmands.

586
00:20:01,657 --> 00:20:03,826
- That's right.
- The sundae tastes amazing.

587
00:20:03,986 --> 00:20:05,385
- It's well made.
- It looks so delicious.

588
00:20:05,386 --> 00:20:07,125
Tae Hyun, can we do...

589
00:20:07,126 --> 00:20:09,325
- the quiz for the freeloaders?
- Isn't it about time?

590
00:20:09,326 --> 00:20:10,965
- Shall we start one?
- That won't be bad.

591
00:20:10,966 --> 00:20:12,196
- Thank you.
- Right now is good.

592
00:20:12,226 --> 00:20:14,365
We need to hurry because the noodles are disappearing.

593
00:20:14,366 --> 00:20:16,696
- Please give us the quiz.
- There isn't any jjolmyeon left.

594
00:20:16,796 --> 00:20:17,865
We must hurry.

595
00:20:17,866 --> 00:20:18,905
- We should hurry.
- But jjolmyeon...

596
00:20:18,906 --> 00:20:21,106
- The sundae tastes good.
- It's really good.

597
00:20:21,576 --> 00:20:23,745
- The sundae tastes good now.
- What's wrong with the sundae?

598
00:20:23,746 --> 00:20:24,805
It finally tastes good.

599
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,205
- Now...
- Can we do the quiz?

600
00:20:26,206 --> 00:20:28,015
At first, it was very watery.

601
00:20:28,016 --> 00:20:29,016
I didn't realize it at first.

602
00:20:29,017 --> 00:20:30,545
It became very rich now.

603
00:20:30,546 --> 00:20:32,446
There's sauce everywhere inside the sundae.

604
00:20:32,646 --> 00:20:33,656
(Eating)

605
00:20:34,686 --> 00:20:35,686
It's tasty.

606
00:20:35,856 --> 00:20:37,556
We'll go ahead with the quiz.

607
00:20:38,056 --> 00:20:40,086
- There's warmth inside...
- Darn it.

608
00:20:40,896 --> 00:20:42,096
Inside the sundae.

609
00:20:42,856 --> 00:20:44,066
- Go.
- Okay.

610
00:20:44,266 --> 00:20:45,896
- Guess the proverb.
- Proverb?

611
00:20:46,566 --> 00:20:48,995
This part of the human being has no bones,

612
00:20:48,996 --> 00:20:50,836
but it can break human bones.

613
00:20:51,436 --> 00:20:52,835
Guess this part.

614
00:20:52,836 --> 00:20:54,106
This part of the human being...

615
00:20:54,436 --> 00:20:57,406
It has no bones, but it can break human bones.

616
00:20:58,376 --> 00:21:00,145
I got it. The tongue.

617
00:21:00,146 --> 00:21:01,715
(Answer: The tongue)

618
00:21:01,716 --> 00:21:03,115
That sounds reasonable.

619
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:04,215
(The tongue has no bones, but it can break human bones.)

620
00:21:04,216 --> 00:21:05,246
Correct.

621
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:08,215
(What?)

622
00:21:08,216 --> 00:21:10,655
Woo Il has a strong punch.

623
00:21:10,656 --> 00:21:12,485
- I thought the answer was "words." - Words?

624
00:21:12,486 --> 00:21:13,925
Woo Il thought of it as a body part.

625
00:21:13,926 --> 00:21:14,956
(Woo Il gets to freeload.)

626
00:21:15,226 --> 00:21:17,295
Woo Il is wearing removable braces.

627
00:21:17,296 --> 00:21:19,166
I'll take out my braces.

628
00:21:19,566 --> 00:21:20,996
Oh, my.

629
00:21:21,096 --> 00:21:24,536
Why are you taking them out while looking at me?

630
00:21:24,706 --> 00:21:26,065
- Goodness.
- Look the other way.

631
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:28,806
(Being all over the place)

632
00:21:29,106 --> 00:21:30,846
He startled me all of a sudden.

633
00:21:31,006 --> 00:21:32,105
(He takes out his braces quickly.)

634
00:21:32,106 --> 00:21:33,205
Seriously.

635
00:21:33,206 --> 00:21:34,215
Okay.

636
00:21:34,216 --> 00:21:35,246
(He's ready to eat.)

637
00:21:36,246 --> 00:21:37,685
You're serving him too much.

638
00:21:37,686 --> 00:21:39,186
(Serving a generous portion of tteokbokki)

639
00:21:39,346 --> 00:21:40,685
I'm supposed to give you a bite,

640
00:21:40,686 --> 00:21:42,256
- but I served you a lot.
- From here...

641
00:21:42,656 --> 00:21:43,725
Yes.

642
00:21:43,726 --> 00:21:45,656
(It's complete with one chicken foot on top.)

643
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:46,995
I served you a lot.

644
00:21:46,996 --> 00:21:48,555
I didn't think you'd taste it...

645
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:50,095
- with only one bite.
- Right.

646
00:21:50,096 --> 00:21:52,266
- Try the chicken foot first.
- I can't wait to taste it.

647
00:21:52,796 --> 00:21:56,466
(He worked hard to freeload on the chicken foot.)

648
00:21:56,966 --> 00:21:58,465
(Gosh, that's automatic deboning.)

649
00:21:58,466 --> 00:21:59,706
That's automatic deboning.

650
00:21:59,766 --> 00:22:03,075
(He worked hard to freeload on the chicken foot.)

651
00:22:03,076 --> 00:22:04,076
(Humming)

652
00:22:08,376 --> 00:22:09,916
I thought that you were spitting out your teeth.

653
00:22:10,816 --> 00:22:11,915
(He worked hard to freeload on the chicken foot.)

654
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,016
Goodness.

655
00:22:13,316 --> 00:22:15,516
I start by eating the toes.

656
00:22:15,816 --> 00:22:17,525
- Some people do that.
- I start by eating the toes.

657
00:22:17,526 --> 00:22:19,726
- They eat the toes first.
- After eating the toes,

658
00:22:20,056 --> 00:22:21,496
I leave this part.

659
00:22:22,696 --> 00:22:25,166
Usually, you have a shot of soju in the middle of it.

660
00:22:25,566 --> 00:22:26,766
That's the best.

661
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,595
(He worked hard to freeload on the chicken foot.)

662
00:22:29,596 --> 00:22:31,906
He reminds me of my grandfather...

663
00:22:32,406 --> 00:22:33,536
without his dentures.

664
00:22:34,906 --> 00:22:36,276
He looks like my grandfather without his dentures.

665
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:37,675
The deboning show.

666
00:22:37,676 --> 00:22:41,445
(The deboning show continues.)

667
00:22:41,446 --> 00:22:42,516
Right.

668
00:22:45,116 --> 00:22:47,716
This is the last part. It's delicious.

669
00:22:48,416 --> 00:22:50,926
(He takes the remaining chicken foot in one bite.)

670
00:22:51,726 --> 00:22:52,726
(One piece of bone)

671
00:22:52,727 --> 00:22:55,556
- That looks very tasty.
- Now I can eat the rest.

672
00:22:56,096 --> 00:22:57,266
- I can eat the rest.
- How is it?

673
00:22:57,796 --> 00:23:01,236
It's slightly spicier than chicken feet that my mom makes.

674
00:23:01,336 --> 00:23:02,636
However, it's not spicy at all.

675
00:23:03,236 --> 00:23:04,335
- It's not spicy.
- Just a little spicy?

676
00:23:04,336 --> 00:23:06,405
It's also a little sweet.

677
00:23:06,406 --> 00:23:07,976
- It's quite sweet.
- It's sweet.

678
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,136
(It's time to eat some tteokbokki.)

679
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,745
- When can I eat this?
- Go ahead.

680
00:23:10,746 --> 00:23:12,545
Wait, let me make it warm.

681
00:23:12,546 --> 00:23:14,015
You like to eat well.

682
00:23:14,016 --> 00:23:15,375
I can't eat it when it's hot.

683
00:23:15,376 --> 00:23:17,345
- It should be hot.
- I can't eat it when it's hot.

684
00:23:17,346 --> 00:23:19,545
- I can't eat it when it's hot.
- It should be hot.

685
00:23:19,546 --> 00:23:21,015
- He wants you to eat it warm.
- It's not good when it's cold.

686
00:23:21,016 --> 00:23:22,155
A lot of steam is rising.

687
00:23:22,156 --> 00:23:23,415
Grab it. That's it.

688
00:23:23,416 --> 00:23:25,225
That's good, but it's greedy.

689
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:26,785
- That's greedy.
- I wish I had some sundae.

690
00:23:26,786 --> 00:23:28,095
That looks nice.

691
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:29,626
- He won't be able to eat the egg.
- Nice.

692
00:23:30,196 --> 00:23:32,096
Nice. It won't be hot.

693
00:23:32,596 --> 00:23:33,696
My goodness.

694
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:37,235
I'm sure...

695
00:23:37,236 --> 00:23:39,206
that women know why I'm doing this.

696
00:23:39,536 --> 00:23:40,776
This is necessary.

697
00:23:41,476 --> 00:23:42,705
I can completely understand him.

698
00:23:42,706 --> 00:23:43,976
(He can empathize based on his experience.)

699
00:23:45,276 --> 00:23:48,746
(I'll go back to concentrating.)

700
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,785
(Watching Woo Il eat from the 1st row)

701
00:23:53,786 --> 00:23:54,956
- Goodness.
- Seriously.

702
00:23:56,086 --> 00:23:57,455
This will get so many views.

703
00:23:57,456 --> 00:23:59,125
I watch this scene every day.

704
00:23:59,126 --> 00:24:00,255
(A successful fan)

705
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,726
I watch this on YouTube every day.

706
00:24:03,126 --> 00:24:04,796
You just need to play that background music.

707
00:24:05,066 --> 00:24:06,595
(Singing)

708
00:24:06,596 --> 00:24:07,666
You know what I mean?

709
00:24:08,536 --> 00:24:10,365
Have some more tteokbokki sauce.

710
00:24:10,366 --> 00:24:17,076
(Tasting all of tteokbokki in one bite)

711
00:24:18,546 --> 00:24:20,145
(He's about to lose his mind.)

712
00:24:20,146 --> 00:24:21,576
That's amazing.

713
00:24:21,646 --> 00:24:22,945
(Next is eating North Korean-style braised chicken.)

714
00:24:22,946 --> 00:24:24,016
It's really good.

715
00:24:24,886 --> 00:24:26,216
Have some dumplings too.

716
00:24:27,116 --> 00:24:28,255
This is priceless.

717
00:24:28,256 --> 00:24:30,186
It's a priceless tasting experience.

718
00:24:30,686 --> 00:24:33,226
I was a little disappointed because there was no jjolmyeon.

719
00:24:33,656 --> 00:24:36,155
There was some jjolmyeon between ramyeon noodles.

720
00:24:36,156 --> 00:24:37,766
As they have different textures,

721
00:24:37,866 --> 00:24:39,666
they taste very different.

722
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:41,535
There's one leftover.

723
00:24:41,536 --> 00:24:42,896
Look.

724
00:24:43,136 --> 00:24:45,205
This? We can't give this to you.

725
00:24:45,206 --> 00:24:46,366
He can't have it.

726
00:24:47,276 --> 00:24:49,306
- I can't?
- You picked that instead.

727
00:24:49,606 --> 00:24:50,975
If you pay later,

728
00:24:50,976 --> 00:24:52,145
- you can eat it all.
- Right.

729
00:24:52,146 --> 00:24:53,475
It'd be like paying 50 dollars for a bite.

730
00:24:53,476 --> 00:24:55,516
After how I've lived my life, do you think...

731
00:24:56,616 --> 00:24:57,886
I'd pay for just one bite?

732
00:24:58,346 --> 00:25:00,245
- In that case...
- Do you know how hard...

733
00:25:00,246 --> 00:25:02,286
I've worked during the last 40 years?

734
00:25:02,756 --> 00:25:04,485
You think I'd pay after one bite?

735
00:25:04,486 --> 00:25:05,555
Here's the quiz.

736
00:25:05,556 --> 00:25:07,226
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

737
00:25:07,526 --> 00:25:09,526
- Please take this image first.
- That's good.

738
00:25:10,126 --> 00:25:12,095
- Wait a minute.
- Didn't you add the toppings?

739
00:25:12,096 --> 00:25:13,096
(Wait a minute.)

740
00:25:13,566 --> 00:25:15,466
- These are wheat cakes.
- They had been added.

741
00:25:16,066 --> 00:25:17,466
The flower is sticking out its tongue.

742
00:25:17,666 --> 00:25:19,265
(Mocking)

743
00:25:19,266 --> 00:25:21,635
As regular tteokbokki is high in calories,

744
00:25:21,636 --> 00:25:24,206
it's sometimes made with konjac...

745
00:25:24,546 --> 00:25:27,415
that's low in carbs and high in fiber.

746
00:25:27,416 --> 00:25:29,315
In English,

747
00:25:29,316 --> 00:25:31,786
konjac is referred as this of a fiend.

748
00:25:31,846 --> 00:25:34,155
It's because the konjac flower looks...

749
00:25:34,156 --> 00:25:35,185
Is it the konjac flower?

750
00:25:35,186 --> 00:25:37,826
Similar to this.

751
00:25:38,486 --> 00:25:40,186
What is this?

752
00:25:40,656 --> 00:25:42,256
- Is this the konjac flower?
- Yes.

753
00:25:42,826 --> 00:25:44,466
I bet it's asparagus.

754
00:25:44,996 --> 00:25:46,795
- Asparagus.
- Let's try to understand.

755
00:25:46,796 --> 00:25:49,096
Look, Dong Hyun. I only see one thing.

756
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:50,506
A sword.

757
00:25:50,866 --> 00:25:52,206
That's a good idea.

758
00:25:52,566 --> 00:25:53,766
That sounds good.

759
00:25:53,906 --> 00:25:56,176
The sword of the fiend?

760
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:58,146
- Or is it the fiend of the sword?
- Let's look at it this way.

761
00:25:58,546 --> 00:26:01,446
The fiend doesn't carry around a sword.

762
00:26:01,976 --> 00:26:03,345
Konjac, the sword of the fiend?

763
00:26:03,346 --> 00:26:06,646
Doesn't the fiend's tongue sound better?

764
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,416
- The tongue?
- I see.

765
00:26:08,756 --> 00:26:09,786
- The tongue?
- Yes.

766
00:26:10,356 --> 00:26:13,286
Konjac is a little bouncy.

767
00:26:13,626 --> 00:26:14,826
You know what konjac is, right?

768
00:26:15,526 --> 00:26:17,056
It also looks like the tongue.

769
00:26:17,266 --> 00:26:19,126
If we think of it abstractly.

770
00:26:19,366 --> 00:26:20,895
A moment ago,

771
00:26:20,896 --> 00:26:23,836
the right answer was the tongue.

772
00:26:23,936 --> 00:26:25,405
- It was the answer I gave.
- Right.

773
00:26:25,406 --> 00:26:27,836
Can the tongue be the answer for the second time?

774
00:26:28,176 --> 00:26:31,076
I don't think that sounds reasonable.

775
00:26:31,246 --> 00:26:32,475
What do you think it is,

776
00:26:32,476 --> 00:26:34,145
- Woo Il?
- I think it's the fiend's...

777
00:26:34,146 --> 00:26:35,415
(The fiend's...)

778
00:26:35,416 --> 00:26:36,475
fencing sword.

779
00:26:36,476 --> 00:26:37,986
(The fiend's fencing sword)

780
00:26:38,316 --> 00:26:40,715
I think he's anxious...

781
00:26:40,716 --> 00:26:41,916
about paying the bill.

782
00:26:42,216 --> 00:26:43,685
As soon as he saw it...

783
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:45,325
We'll go with the fiend's tongue.

784
00:26:45,326 --> 00:26:46,385
The answer is...

785
00:26:46,386 --> 00:26:47,796
- the fiend's tongue.
- "The fiend's tongue?"

786
00:26:48,126 --> 00:26:49,526
I don't see another option.

787
00:26:49,996 --> 00:26:51,466
- I bet it's correct.
- The answer is...

788
00:26:52,096 --> 00:26:54,096
- correct.
- We're right.

789
00:26:54,796 --> 00:26:56,136
We got it.

790
00:26:57,736 --> 00:26:59,365
(Mixed feelings of joy and sorrow)

791
00:26:59,366 --> 00:27:01,506
It was an easy problem for the price.

792
00:27:01,806 --> 00:27:02,806
Yes.

793
00:27:02,807 --> 00:27:04,346
It was an easy problem for the price.

794
00:27:05,246 --> 00:27:08,516
(Sticking out his tongue at him)

795
00:27:09,276 --> 00:27:10,346
Dong Hyun.

796
00:27:11,446 --> 00:27:12,716
- All right.
- Come on.

797
00:27:12,786 --> 00:27:14,316
We're 45 years old.

798
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,556
- I need to keep my face.
- Sticking out the tongue is...

799
00:27:17,856 --> 00:27:20,355
The big picture is almost complete.

800
00:27:20,356 --> 00:27:22,756
- We have to make it.
- Okay.

801
00:27:22,856 --> 00:27:26,366
What price will Woo Il start to pay?

802
00:27:26,996 --> 00:27:29,096
I will give you three choices.

803
00:27:29,266 --> 00:27:31,705
- Three choices?
- I'll give you three choices.

804
00:27:31,706 --> 00:27:33,236
One of them must be wrong.

805
00:27:33,836 --> 00:27:35,335
- Rock-paper-scissors is important.
- Right.

806
00:27:35,336 --> 00:27:36,435
Let's hear the question first.

807
00:27:36,436 --> 00:27:39,845
Rice cakes are categorized based on how they're made.

808
00:27:39,846 --> 00:27:44,086
Choose the correct pairing of the type of rice cake...

809
00:27:44,186 --> 00:27:46,515
and its method of preparation.

810
00:27:46,516 --> 00:27:47,915
There are two correct answers.

811
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,315
- Okay.
- Two correct answers?

812
00:27:49,316 --> 00:27:51,156
- Yes. One of them is wrong.
- One of them is wrong.

813
00:27:51,686 --> 00:27:53,526
Number one, bingtteok.

814
00:27:54,126 --> 00:27:55,926
- "Bingtteok?" - Rice cakes made by pounding.

815
00:27:56,256 --> 00:27:58,966
Number two, gyeongdan that's made by steaming.

816
00:27:59,226 --> 00:28:02,566
Number three, bukkumi that's made by pan-frying.

817
00:28:03,496 --> 00:28:05,235
- I think I know the answer.
- Me too.

818
00:28:05,236 --> 00:28:06,506
Let's play rock-paper-scissors first.

819
00:28:06,606 --> 00:28:07,836
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

820
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:09,136
Okay.

821
00:28:09,137 --> 00:28:10,305
(Woo Il is in 1st place.)

822
00:28:10,306 --> 00:28:12,705
Then Woo Il won't have to pay.

823
00:28:12,706 --> 00:28:14,145
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

824
00:28:14,146 --> 00:28:15,176
Okay, I'm in second place.

825
00:28:15,416 --> 00:28:17,245
- Go ahead and pick 1.
- I'll pick 1.

826
00:28:17,246 --> 00:28:19,815
- Woo Il survived.
- Exactly.

827
00:28:19,816 --> 00:28:21,556
He's different when money is at stake.

828
00:28:21,956 --> 00:28:22,986
Number two.

829
00:28:23,586 --> 00:28:25,056
- Gyeongdan?
- Gyeongdan.

830
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,585
Gyeongdan that's made by steaming.

831
00:28:26,586 --> 00:28:28,155
I didn't think that was correct.

832
00:28:28,156 --> 00:28:31,196
Time is up. I'll go with number three, bukkumi.

833
00:28:31,596 --> 00:28:32,625
- Pan-fried rice cake?
- Pan-fried rice cake?

834
00:28:32,626 --> 00:28:34,165
- I thought bukkumi...
- Then mine is...

835
00:28:34,166 --> 00:28:35,665
number one, bingtteok that's made by pounding.

836
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:36,736
Okay, let's go.

837
00:28:36,936 --> 00:28:38,566
You knew it was wrong, right?

838
00:28:39,406 --> 00:28:40,675
- No.
- Or did you pick randomly?

839
00:28:40,676 --> 00:28:42,036
Bingtteok is incorrect.

840
00:28:42,206 --> 00:28:44,105
- Because bingtteok is incorrect?
- Because bingtteok is incorrect?

841
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:45,906
- Bingtteok is incorrect.
- Then how is it made?

842
00:28:46,046 --> 00:28:47,145
You don't know?

843
00:28:47,146 --> 00:28:49,346
- I don't know what it is.
- Isn't it a frozen rice cake?

844
00:28:50,016 --> 00:28:51,886
(I see...)

845
00:28:52,086 --> 00:28:53,185
No way.

846
00:28:53,186 --> 00:28:54,486
- You don't know?
- What is it?

847
00:28:54,686 --> 00:28:56,316
- Do you know?
- Tell us the answer.

848
00:28:56,716 --> 00:28:59,786
One of the correct answers is...

849
00:29:00,626 --> 00:29:01,756
number three, bukkumi.

850
00:29:02,696 --> 00:29:03,825
He looks scared.

851
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:05,065
I got out of it.

852
00:29:05,066 --> 00:29:06,796
- Woo Il looks scared.
- I got out of it.

853
00:29:07,026 --> 00:29:08,866
(Yi Kyung escaped successfully.)

854
00:29:09,136 --> 00:29:11,335
Hey. Goodness.

855
00:29:11,336 --> 00:29:13,966
- Look at Woo Il's face.
- Could it be...

856
00:29:14,236 --> 00:29:16,076
This is stressful.

857
00:29:17,446 --> 00:29:19,146
- Between the remaining two...
- What's the result?

858
00:29:19,987 --> 00:29:21,226
Between the remaining two...

859
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:24,227
- What's the result?
- Don't lose hope.

860
00:29:24,497 --> 00:29:26,527
Gyeongdan that's made by steaming.

861
00:29:26,627 --> 00:29:28,096
- Gyeongdan that's made by steaming.
- That's not important.

862
00:29:28,097 --> 00:29:30,596
(If gyeongdan is correct, Sang Uk will pay.)

863
00:29:30,597 --> 00:29:31,597
(Number 2, gyeongdan that's made by steaming)

864
00:29:31,598 --> 00:29:32,667
Correct.

865
00:29:33,867 --> 00:29:36,566
(Woo Il is correct.)

866
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:38,577
He knew the right answer.

867
00:29:39,077 --> 00:29:40,376
Thank you for the food.

868
00:29:40,377 --> 00:29:41,577
- Thank you.
- All right.

869
00:29:42,577 --> 00:29:44,716
- Let's go get some braised chicken.
- Thank you for the food.

870
00:29:44,717 --> 00:29:46,817
- Let's get braised chicken, Woo Il.
- That sounds good.

871
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,086
Yes.

872
00:29:48,087 --> 00:29:50,646
(Total: 58 dollars)

873
00:29:50,647 --> 00:29:52,586
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the food.

874
00:29:52,587 --> 00:29:54,226
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

875
00:29:54,227 --> 00:29:56,186
We're finally going to eat.

876
00:29:56,187 --> 00:29:58,557
- We need some braised chicken.
- Braised chicken.

877
00:29:58,927 --> 00:30:02,227
I'm feeling good because I didn't pay.

878
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:04,266
- Your mood will fluctuate a lot.
- He got more energetic.

879
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:06,096
- He got more energetic.
- There will be ups and downs.

880
00:30:06,097 --> 00:30:08,266
You're better at quizzes than I thought.

881
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:09,567
Do you think you won't pay again this time?

882
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:11,736
- Here's why.
- Okay.

883
00:30:11,737 --> 00:30:14,576
Since I started not paying, I might as well not pay at all.

884
00:30:14,577 --> 00:30:15,646
- Of course.
- You're right.

885
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,116
He suddenly got energetic right after the quiz.

886
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:20,447
Yes, I felt much relieved.

887
00:30:20,817 --> 00:30:22,216
He's keeping the momentum.

888
00:30:22,217 --> 00:30:24,287
There it is. It's a makguksu place, but they have braised chicken too.

889
00:30:25,517 --> 00:30:27,626
- It's a popular restaurant.
- It really is.

890
00:30:27,627 --> 00:30:29,157
- You can tell from the signboard.
- It's a popular restaurant.

891
00:30:29,357 --> 00:30:30,586
This is...

892
00:30:30,587 --> 00:30:32,897
It has the vibe of a popular restaurant.

893
00:30:33,897 --> 00:30:36,167
(LMR 2)

894
00:30:38,697 --> 00:30:40,937
(It catches your eye as soon as you enter.)

895
00:30:41,807 --> 00:30:44,177
(Featured on many TV shows)

896
00:30:45,007 --> 00:30:48,107
(Forget about the braised chicken that you have known until now.)

897
00:30:50,347 --> 00:30:51,647
(One whole cooked chicken...)

898
00:30:52,317 --> 00:30:53,677
(and spring onions that are responsible for the texture)

899
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:59,187
(LMR 2, North Korean-style braised chicken)

900
00:30:59,317 --> 00:31:01,286
- Hello.
- Hello.

901
00:31:01,287 --> 00:31:02,656
- Hello.
- Hello.

902
00:31:02,657 --> 00:31:03,756
Thank you for coming.

903
00:31:03,757 --> 00:31:05,026
(The owner of M Makguksu, Lee Hye Ja)

904
00:31:05,027 --> 00:31:06,056
- Yes.
- We'd like to make...

905
00:31:06,057 --> 00:31:08,197
We'd like to make our order.

906
00:31:08,327 --> 00:31:11,536
- We should get the braised chicken.
- Of course.

907
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,496
One mul makguksu, one bibim makguksu,

908
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,366
and braised chicken. Let's order one more.

909
00:31:15,367 --> 00:31:16,367
- Right.
- Okay.

910
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:17,367
One more.

911
00:31:17,677 --> 00:31:19,436
How about dumplings?

912
00:31:19,437 --> 00:31:21,847
- Plate dumplings?
- Plate dumplings.

913
00:31:21,877 --> 00:31:24,876
I can't decide. Between mung bean pancake and buckwheat pajeon,

914
00:31:24,877 --> 00:31:27,416
which one would you recommend?

915
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:28,946
Which is fresher today?

916
00:31:28,947 --> 00:31:30,386
Mung beans or green onions?

917
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:32,187
Don't people ask that at a raw fish restaurant?

918
00:31:32,687 --> 00:31:36,286
- Which fish is fresh today?
- Which one is good?

919
00:31:36,287 --> 00:31:37,756
I didn't know we could ask that for emergency crops.

920
00:31:37,757 --> 00:31:39,996
It doesn't only apply to fish.

921
00:31:39,997 --> 00:31:42,266
Green onions also have a state of condition.

922
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:43,496
How are the green onions today?

923
00:31:43,497 --> 00:31:45,566
They're in their best condition today.

924
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:46,736
- They're in their best condition.
- Yes.

925
00:31:46,737 --> 00:31:48,436
Are they in better shape than the mung beans?

926
00:31:48,437 --> 00:31:49,506
- Yes.
- How about the mung beans?

927
00:31:49,507 --> 00:31:53,137
- How are the mung beans?
- They were ground yesterday.

928
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:54,876
- They're very fresh.
- Okay.

929
00:31:54,877 --> 00:31:56,577
- Let's get mung bean pancakes.
- Mung bean.

930
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,946
Braised chicken, mung bean pancakes,

931
00:31:58,947 --> 00:32:01,086
mul makguksu, bibim makguksu, and plate dumplings.

932
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,746
- That will be our order.
- I'll get that ready.

933
00:32:02,747 --> 00:32:04,557
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

934
00:32:05,287 --> 00:32:08,427
By the way, this is very important.

935
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:10,857
Do you like chicken legs? Which part do you like?

936
00:32:11,427 --> 00:32:12,597
I like everything.

937
00:32:12,627 --> 00:32:13,797
Because there are only two chicken legs?

938
00:32:13,927 --> 00:32:14,927
How about you?

939
00:32:14,928 --> 00:32:16,496
- I like chicken legs.
- You like chicken legs?

940
00:32:16,497 --> 00:32:19,736
Shouldn't you yield to them as someone older?

941
00:32:19,737 --> 00:32:22,806
There are Confucian ideas in Korea.

942
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:26,476
"Confucian ideas?" What does that have to do with this?

943
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,046
We have 5,000 years of Confucian history.

944
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:29,576
Why don't we play rock-paper-scissors?

945
00:32:29,577 --> 00:32:30,777
The two winners get to eat the legs.

946
00:32:30,877 --> 00:32:32,016
(What about Confucianism?)

947
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:34,146
That's fair. You have to be fair these days.

948
00:32:34,147 --> 00:32:35,417
This could raise a controversy.

949
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,956
No, you have to play fair these days.

950
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,926
- Rock-paper-scissors? Okay.
- Play fair.

951
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:42,587
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

952
00:32:42,827 --> 00:32:43,957
Yes.

953
00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:47,197
Goodness.

954
00:32:48,297 --> 00:32:49,297
Yes.

955
00:32:49,298 --> 00:32:50,496
(The ownership of the chicken legs was determined immediately.)

956
00:32:50,497 --> 00:32:52,136
It's okay. You won last time.

957
00:32:52,137 --> 00:32:53,137
- Yes.
- You can't keep winning.

958
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:56,136
You'll yield two chicken legs to the younger ones.

959
00:32:56,137 --> 00:32:57,137
Thank you.

960
00:32:57,307 --> 00:32:58,977
Now that we're at it, shall we fight for chicken wings?

961
00:32:59,237 --> 00:33:00,336
There are only two chicken wings too.

962
00:33:00,337 --> 00:33:01,747
If I lose again,

963
00:33:02,307 --> 00:33:03,877
I'll be wingless.

964
00:33:06,177 --> 00:33:08,016
The three of us can't share...

965
00:33:08,017 --> 00:33:10,247
- two wings.
- We could also eat wings first.

966
00:33:10,417 --> 00:33:11,787
This is the worst ever.

967
00:33:13,287 --> 00:33:16,757
- Isn't it better to win 1 wing?
- There aren't 3 wings.

968
00:33:16,887 --> 00:33:18,996
- I need to win at least one.
- Exactly.

969
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,257
I need to win at least one.

970
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:21,826
- Let's play fair.
- Seriously.

971
00:33:21,827 --> 00:33:22,966
- What shall we play?
- Or you could...

972
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:24,197
- play rock-paper-scissors.
- Let's do this.

973
00:33:24,667 --> 00:33:26,837
I'm not going to play.

974
00:33:27,197 --> 00:33:28,306
I won't do this.

975
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:30,006
(Yi Kyung's hand signal makes Woo Il get up suddenly.)

976
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:31,676
How did they know last time?

977
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:32,937
- I don't know.
- It's strange.

978
00:33:33,237 --> 00:33:34,807
- Did you plan it beforehand?
- No.

979
00:33:35,277 --> 00:33:37,646
- Yi Kyung showed it to me.
- I planned it with Woo Il.

980
00:33:37,647 --> 00:33:38,647
(This is what happened.)

981
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:41,047
(A moment ago)

982
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:43,486
(Yi Kyung was being cautious.)

983
00:33:43,487 --> 00:33:45,486
(Giving a scissors sign)

984
00:33:45,487 --> 00:33:47,357
(Okay)

985
00:33:47,457 --> 00:33:48,887
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

986
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,957
(Woo Il lost because he trusted him.)

987
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:53,557
Yes.

988
00:33:54,227 --> 00:33:56,466
Instead of yielding to younger people,

989
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:57,936
you're determined to defeat them.

990
00:33:57,937 --> 00:33:59,536
You're older than them.

991
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:01,766
- For chicken wings?
- Chicken wings.

992
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:03,237
Did you two plan it again?

993
00:34:03,367 --> 00:34:04,476
- You're accusing us again.
- How about this?

994
00:34:04,477 --> 00:34:06,806
Play with your backs on each other. We'll watch.

995
00:34:06,807 --> 00:34:08,246
- Okay.
- That's even more dangerous.

996
00:34:08,247 --> 00:34:09,846
It's impossible to plan it beforehand.

997
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:10,876
He watched our show.

998
00:34:10,877 --> 00:34:12,316
That's our unwritten rule.

999
00:34:12,317 --> 00:34:14,786
We turn around and play so that no one can plan it.

1000
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:16,387
- You turn around?
- It's impossible to plan it.

1001
00:34:17,817 --> 00:34:19,056
- Since you can't see the others?
- You can't see them.

1002
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:21,356
- Since you can't see the others?
- All three of us will turn around.

1003
00:34:21,357 --> 00:34:22,786
- None of us will see each other.
- With your back on each other.

1004
00:34:22,787 --> 00:34:23,926
Okay.

1005
00:34:23,927 --> 00:34:25,156
Turn your back on each other.

1006
00:34:25,157 --> 00:34:27,896
- If you turn your head slightly, - Okay.

1007
00:34:27,897 --> 00:34:29,226
- you'll be eliminated immediately.
- Okay.

1008
00:34:29,227 --> 00:34:30,227
- We're the judges.
- Okay.

1009
00:34:30,228 --> 00:34:31,397
Put your back on each other.

1010
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:35,136
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1011
00:34:35,137 --> 00:34:37,467
(Playing rock after one beat)

1012
00:34:37,667 --> 00:34:38,676
Look at that.

1013
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:39,677
(Rock-paper-scissors that they can't lose)

1014
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,476
- Nice.
- See that?

1015
00:34:41,477 --> 00:34:44,146
(What just happened?)

1016
00:34:44,147 --> 00:34:45,717
I can't believe that I won.

1017
00:34:46,447 --> 00:34:49,086
- It's impossible to plan it.
- They were watching us.

1018
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:50,186
- Seriously.
- We were watching everything.

1019
00:34:50,187 --> 00:34:51,417
This is impossible.

1020
00:34:51,487 --> 00:34:52,656
- Why not?
- Seriously.

1021
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:56,056
- Mathematically, it's impossible.
- Such luck is impossible.

1022
00:34:56,057 --> 00:34:58,297
- Then why did you play scissors?
- Woo Il.

1023
00:34:58,497 --> 00:34:59,497
I stood up and...

1024
00:34:59,827 --> 00:35:01,296
Mathematically, this is impossible.

1025
00:35:01,297 --> 00:35:03,127
I didn't even change my sign.

1026
00:35:03,297 --> 00:35:04,467
Now, let's play for the chicken body.

1027
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:08,636
- What?
- There are only two breasts.

1028
00:35:08,637 --> 00:35:11,476
- Then why am I here today?
- You can still eat some chicken.

1029
00:35:11,477 --> 00:35:12,676
He won't get to eat any chicken.

1030
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:15,877
- For the chicken breast...
- My goodness.

1031
00:35:16,377 --> 00:35:18,376
- The food is here.
- It's served quickly.

1032
00:35:18,377 --> 00:35:19,546
(The order arrives.)

1033
00:35:19,547 --> 00:35:20,677
It's a mung bean pancake.

1034
00:35:20,747 --> 00:35:22,846
I've never seen dumplings like these.

1035
00:35:22,847 --> 00:35:24,487
- Look at the makguksu.
- Spring onions are on top?

1036
00:35:25,487 --> 00:35:26,857
- This is nice.
- It looks delicious.

1037
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:30,226
(Milky chicken thigh...)

1038
00:35:30,227 --> 00:35:33,397
(and spring onions make the perfect match.)

1039
00:35:34,997 --> 00:35:37,297
(A combination that lets you taste the essence of chicken)

1040
00:35:37,597 --> 00:35:40,267
(North Korean-style braised chicken)

1041
00:35:41,237 --> 00:35:44,136
(Filled with dumpling filling made from scratch...)

1042
00:35:44,137 --> 00:35:47,177
(and shaped into wavy folds)

1043
00:35:47,377 --> 00:35:49,447
(Characterized by thick dumpling wrappers and the unpolished look)

1044
00:35:50,547 --> 00:35:53,777
(North Korean-style dumplings)

1045
00:35:54,217 --> 00:35:57,747
(Light and clean mul makguksu and bibim makguksu)

1046
00:35:58,387 --> 00:36:00,186
(Grilled until golden and crispy)

1047
00:36:00,187 --> 00:36:02,257
(Mung bean pancake)

1048
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:08,567
(Would you like a North Korean set meal?)

1049
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:11,437
How do I make the seasoning?

1050
00:36:11,697 --> 00:36:14,767
Add this first.

1051
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:16,606
Add a spoon of this? Mustard and vinegar.

1052
00:36:16,607 --> 00:36:18,677
- Add mustard and vinegar.
- Some mustard and vinegar.

1053
00:36:19,007 --> 00:36:21,007
This much? I see.

1054
00:36:21,247 --> 00:36:22,707
The ratio is 1 to 1 to 3.

1055
00:36:22,877 --> 00:36:25,246
- Do I mix them?
- Mix them thoroughly.

1056
00:36:25,247 --> 00:36:26,276
(Ready to eat North Korean-style braised chicken)

1057
00:36:26,277 --> 00:36:29,446
You have to eat the meat with spring onions.

1058
00:36:29,447 --> 00:36:31,287
- Meat and spring onions?
- We must eat them together?

1059
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:33,417
(In awe)

1060
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:36,426
(The chicken thigh reveals its milky beauty.)

1061
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:37,686
And the chicken thigh.

1062
00:36:37,687 --> 00:36:39,897
You don't sell this separately, do you?

1063
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:42,526
- No, we sell the whole chicken.
- Right?

1064
00:36:42,527 --> 00:36:44,166
You're right. For chicken...

1065
00:36:44,167 --> 00:36:45,667
- It's for you, Woo Il.
- What?

1066
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:47,467
Really?

1067
00:36:47,468 --> 00:36:49,307
(Yi Kyung yields the chicken thigh.)

1068
00:36:49,537 --> 00:36:50,566
Really?

1069
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:52,237
Sergeant Im Woo Il. I love you.

1070
00:36:52,437 --> 00:36:54,747
Thank you. I'll work hard.

1071
00:36:55,607 --> 00:36:56,806
- Thank you.
- What's going on, Yi Kyung?

1072
00:36:56,807 --> 00:36:58,376
- He's someone I like.
- I'll work hard.

1073
00:36:58,377 --> 00:36:59,616
He wants it so much.

1074
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:00,746
This is...

1075
00:37:00,747 --> 00:37:02,417
- Please answer the quiz for us.
- I will.

1076
00:37:04,147 --> 00:37:06,456
People usually say, "No, it's okay. You should eat it."

1077
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:07,657
I thought you'd say the same.

1078
00:37:08,457 --> 00:37:09,487
"Thank you."

1079
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:10,856
Sergeant Im Woo Il.

1080
00:37:10,857 --> 00:37:11,857
(Stingy Woo Il doesn't do that.)

1081
00:37:11,858 --> 00:37:13,356
- "Sergeant?" - Wrap one.

1082
00:37:13,357 --> 00:37:15,767
- Wrap one.
- I can eat it later.

1083
00:37:16,297 --> 00:37:17,797
Dip it in the sauce.

1084
00:37:18,967 --> 00:37:19,967
Look at this.

1085
00:37:21,807 --> 00:37:22,907
Enjoy your food.

1086
00:37:23,067 --> 00:37:25,277
Okay, thank you for the food.

1087
00:37:26,507 --> 00:37:28,307
(Eating)

1088
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:36,147
(Foodie Sang Uk also eats it all in one bite.)

1089
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:43,487
(Frowning of the truth)

1090
00:37:44,527 --> 00:37:45,757
It's fine with plenty of the sauce.

1091
00:37:49,097 --> 00:37:50,297
So this is it.

1092
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:52,836
The sauce is...

1093
00:37:52,837 --> 00:37:55,307
- The spring onions are insane.
- The sauce is the kick.

1094
00:37:55,637 --> 00:37:57,667
I see why it's served with spring onions.

1095
00:37:58,907 --> 00:38:01,006
If you eat the chicken by itself,

1096
00:38:01,007 --> 00:38:02,746
it could be slightly bland.

1097
00:38:02,747 --> 00:38:05,847
- Right.
- When the spring onion is added...

1098
00:38:06,277 --> 00:38:09,146
The chicken's texture can be boring,

1099
00:38:09,147 --> 00:38:10,286
but the spring onions take care of that.

1100
00:38:10,287 --> 00:38:11,316
(Spring onions take care of the texture.)

1101
00:38:11,317 --> 00:38:13,786
You can eat more spring onions than you think.

1102
00:38:13,787 --> 00:38:16,127
I heard that it was tastier when you tear it off.

1103
00:38:20,497 --> 00:38:22,497
Here comes the preview.

1104
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,897
(Eating in one bite)

1105
00:38:28,037 --> 00:38:30,536
(Woo Il's eating draws everyone in.)

1106
00:38:30,537 --> 00:38:31,707
Did you eat the bones too?

1107
00:38:32,907 --> 00:38:33,976
The bone...

1108
00:38:33,977 --> 00:38:35,247
(He debones it completely.)

1109
00:38:38,147 --> 00:38:40,317
- Look at that.
- That looks so good.

1110
00:38:40,477 --> 00:38:41,817
It smells incredibly good.

1111
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:44,616
- It's very chewy.
- It's the most tender part.

1112
00:38:44,617 --> 00:38:45,757
The meat inside.

1113
00:38:46,317 --> 00:38:49,356
- It fits right inside the mouth.
- Yes, like a mouthpiece.

1114
00:38:49,357 --> 00:38:51,926
- A mouthpiece?
- Yes, he's right.

1115
00:38:51,927 --> 00:38:53,727
- It fits perfectly - Try it on.

1116
00:38:55,627 --> 00:38:56,627
There you go.

1117
00:38:56,967 --> 00:38:58,337
You're so right.

1118
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:00,497
(Laughing)

1119
00:39:01,567 --> 00:39:02,907
- Look at that.
- And the puffy eyes.

1120
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:05,637
(Attention to detail)

1121
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,977
(Channeling his day job)

1122
00:39:15,717 --> 00:39:17,446
You deserve to eat this.

1123
00:39:17,447 --> 00:39:18,717
(He deserves the meal.)

1124
00:39:19,617 --> 00:39:21,987
(Their fight never ends.)

1125
00:39:30,327 --> 00:39:32,067
The chicken neck mouthpiece.

1126
00:39:33,467 --> 00:39:34,736
It's really good.

1127
00:39:34,737 --> 00:39:35,906
(He satisfied everyone with how he ate the chicken neck.)

1128
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:37,336
- He ate it down to the bone.
- Hold on.

1129
00:39:37,337 --> 00:39:38,506
Even the other side.

1130
00:39:38,507 --> 00:39:40,677
(Sucking)

1131
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:42,977
He's playing the harmonica now.

1132
00:39:43,107 --> 00:39:45,277
Comedians are in a league of their own.

1133
00:39:45,647 --> 00:39:47,476
- Let's have the dumplings next.
- Dumplings?

1134
00:39:47,477 --> 00:39:48,586
Should I leave this for you?

1135
00:39:48,587 --> 00:39:49,946
Did I or didn't I give you some chicken?

1136
00:39:49,947 --> 00:39:51,047
You gave me some.

1137
00:39:52,487 --> 00:39:54,317
Thank you. I'm Sergeant Im Woo Il!

1138
00:39:54,357 --> 00:39:56,126
That was yours to begin with.

1139
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:57,287
- Right.
- The dumpling.

1140
00:39:57,487 --> 00:39:58,956
(Oh, of course.)

1141
00:39:58,957 --> 00:40:01,527
Why should I eat this with gratitude?

1142
00:40:01,597 --> 00:40:02,597
Aren't you grateful?

1143
00:40:02,598 --> 00:40:03,726
I'm grateful.

1144
00:40:03,727 --> 00:40:05,436
I'm grateful but...

1145
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:06,497
Well, this is a dumpling.

1146
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:08,206
Let's eat the dumplings together...

1147
00:40:08,207 --> 00:40:09,937
- and enjoy the makguksu next.
- And then the makguksu?

1148
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:12,006
(Dipping the plump dumplings in soy sauce)

1149
00:40:12,007 --> 00:40:13,207
These are huge.

1150
00:40:13,537 --> 00:40:15,206
- The dumplings are huge.
- Check out the dumplings.

1151
00:40:15,207 --> 00:40:16,547
He ate the entire thing.

1152
00:40:17,347 --> 00:40:18,577
He ate all of it as is.

1153
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:19,947
It's huge.

1154
00:40:22,217 --> 00:40:23,547
He ate the entire thing.

1155
00:40:25,617 --> 00:40:26,717
Woo Il.

1156
00:40:28,787 --> 00:40:30,856
- It's kimchi...
- No way.

1157
00:40:30,857 --> 00:40:32,527
The kimchi flavors aren't strong.

1158
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:38,026
It's kimchi dumpling,

1159
00:40:38,027 --> 00:40:39,737
but the kimchi flavor isn't strong. What am I tasting?

1160
00:40:40,437 --> 00:40:41,466
What are these flavors?

1161
00:40:41,467 --> 00:40:43,166
- Meat and...
- Kimchi sauce?

1162
00:40:43,167 --> 00:40:44,536
- I taste kimchi.
- It's meat,

1163
00:40:44,537 --> 00:40:46,206
but this doesn't taste like your traditional meat dumpling.

1164
00:40:46,207 --> 00:40:47,207
- Is it meat?
- This isn't...

1165
00:40:47,208 --> 00:40:48,576
- your traditional meat dumpling.
- It isn't.

1166
00:40:48,577 --> 00:40:49,706
This isn't like anything I've tasted before.

1167
00:40:49,707 --> 00:40:50,707
What is this?

1168
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:51,816
There's...

1169
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:54,377
a sweetness to it. What is this?

1170
00:40:54,987 --> 00:40:57,087
We should ask what's in this.

1171
00:40:58,217 --> 00:41:01,557
So that you can taste the juice from the meat,

1172
00:41:01,887 --> 00:41:04,956
we mix the filling with our hands and don't grind the meat.

1173
00:41:04,957 --> 00:41:06,826
You're able to taste all the ingredients.

1174
00:41:06,827 --> 00:41:08,597
(The ingredients are combined by hand.)

1175
00:41:10,627 --> 00:41:12,997
(These are dumplings made by hand. That sounds delicious!)

1176
00:41:13,197 --> 00:41:14,667
Can you please mix this?

1177
00:41:15,367 --> 00:41:16,837
- The noodles?
- Just this one.

1178
00:41:17,907 --> 00:41:20,306
I see it is topped off with sesame oil.

1179
00:41:20,307 --> 00:41:21,606
There's sesame oil in there.

1180
00:41:21,607 --> 00:41:23,106
(Inhaling through his teeth)

1181
00:41:23,107 --> 00:41:24,146
Check out the color on that.

1182
00:41:24,147 --> 00:41:25,516
- Look at Woo Il.
- This is just...

1183
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:27,716
It's like he's on a home shopping channel.

1184
00:41:27,717 --> 00:41:28,816
(North Korean-style makguksu)

1185
00:41:28,817 --> 00:41:29,986
(What should you try before dying? It's North Korean-style makguksu)

1186
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,087
Everyone...

1187
00:41:32,717 --> 00:41:33,986
It's going to sell like crazy.

1188
00:41:33,987 --> 00:41:37,056
(North Korean-style makguksu)

1189
00:41:37,057 --> 00:41:40,156
(Something about this dish is different.)

1190
00:41:40,157 --> 00:41:42,397
(They'll definitely buy the makguksu.)

1191
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,296
(Thumbs up)

1192
00:41:44,297 --> 00:41:45,537
(Dig in, guys.)

1193
00:41:46,037 --> 00:41:47,866
Compared to that, this...

1194
00:41:47,867 --> 00:41:50,067
This smells incredible.

1195
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:52,677
It's different.

1196
00:41:55,677 --> 00:41:58,047
(Yummy)

1197
00:41:59,877 --> 00:42:01,147
(My gosh)

1198
00:42:02,217 --> 00:42:03,487
This smells incredible.

1199
00:42:04,217 --> 00:42:06,557
It's different.

1200
00:42:06,887 --> 00:42:09,727
There must be something different about North Korean-style makguksu.

1201
00:42:09,927 --> 00:42:11,756
If I could only have one dish,

1202
00:42:11,757 --> 00:42:13,997
- I'd have the noodles.
- Same here.

1203
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:17,027
- The noodles are to die for.
- It's really good.

1204
00:42:17,297 --> 00:42:18,867
- I usually prefer mul makguksu.
- The sauce...

1205
00:42:19,837 --> 00:42:21,606
You should wrap the dumpling with this.

1206
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:23,236
(He knows how to eat. Wrap the dumpling with it.)

1207
00:42:23,237 --> 00:42:25,907
Are you selling makguksu or the dumplings?

1208
00:42:26,407 --> 00:42:28,036
- What's going on?
- Is it a combo?

1209
00:42:28,037 --> 00:42:29,176
A combo? So that's what it is.

1210
00:42:29,177 --> 00:42:31,077
It's dumpling-guksu.

1211
00:42:31,747 --> 00:42:35,246
Once again, he dislocated his jaw.

1212
00:42:35,247 --> 00:42:36,486
That looks really good.

1213
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,516
He must be able to easily pop his jaw back in.

1214
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:41,116
The range of motion for his jaws...

1215
00:42:41,117 --> 00:42:42,127
(Fascinated)

1216
00:42:42,587 --> 00:42:44,286
He's like a crocodile.

1217
00:42:44,287 --> 00:42:46,327
(The home shopping model matches the quality of the food.)

1218
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:51,167
(Handsome Guys' noodle-slurping ambassador is up next.)

1219
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:54,137
It's even better with the dumpling.

1220
00:42:54,637 --> 00:42:56,066
You really need to add that.

1221
00:42:56,067 --> 00:42:57,867
They serve the best makguksu.

1222
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:01,006
Now that we've eaten,

1223
00:43:01,007 --> 00:43:02,407
- shouldn't we give them a chance?
- I'd like the chicken breast.

1224
00:43:02,847 --> 00:43:04,177
Freeloading?

1225
00:43:04,447 --> 00:43:05,647
- Sure.
- Sounds good.

1226
00:43:05,677 --> 00:43:06,777
Give us our question.

1227
00:43:07,377 --> 00:43:09,047
I will give you a famous saying,

1228
00:43:09,217 --> 00:43:10,486
but it will be missing three words.

1229
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:12,516
Every time you get one right,

1230
00:43:12,517 --> 00:43:13,786
- rather than stacking the food...
- One per one correct answer?

1231
00:43:13,787 --> 00:43:15,327
Yes, one per one correct answer.

1232
00:43:15,957 --> 00:43:17,186
- I like that.
- One of you...

1233
00:43:17,187 --> 00:43:18,857
One of you could win all three bites.

1234
00:43:19,457 --> 00:43:20,957
- That's new.
- All right, then.

1235
00:43:21,327 --> 00:43:23,096
This was said by Schopenhauer.

1236
00:43:23,097 --> 00:43:24,427
Schopenhauer. He's famous.

1237
00:43:25,397 --> 00:43:27,366
- Schopen...
- You see his words in restrooms.

1238
00:43:27,367 --> 00:43:28,607
- Sure.
- Schopenhauer.

1239
00:43:28,967 --> 00:43:32,477
"All truth passes through three stages."

1240
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:34,436
- Here we go.
- "First,"

1241
00:43:34,437 --> 00:43:35,647
"it is A."

1242
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:38,976
"Second, it is violently B."

1243
00:43:38,977 --> 00:43:42,517
"Third, it is accepted as C."

1244
00:43:43,717 --> 00:43:44,847
- What...
- I got it.

1245
00:43:45,687 --> 00:43:46,817
This is for B.

1246
00:43:47,057 --> 00:43:48,426
- Go ahead.
- A crisis.

1247
00:43:48,427 --> 00:43:49,886
(Answer for B: Crisis)

1248
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:51,287
- Incorrect.
- I got it.

1249
00:43:52,257 --> 00:43:54,027
C, the truth.

1250
00:43:54,697 --> 00:43:56,027
I'm clueless.

1251
00:43:56,897 --> 00:43:57,997
That is correct.

1252
00:43:59,097 --> 00:44:00,636
I told you he was smart!

1253
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:02,236
(Dong Hyun gets 1 bite of something.)

1254
00:44:02,237 --> 00:44:04,467
Talk about a lucky punch.

1255
00:44:04,637 --> 00:44:05,937
What will you have?

1256
00:44:06,737 --> 00:44:09,107
I want the dumpling and also the chicken breast.

1257
00:44:09,207 --> 00:44:10,546
- We're not done yet.
- I get to eat...

1258
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:11,547
- after I get one right.
- Hold on.

1259
00:44:11,547 --> 00:44:12,547
If you get the other two right...

1260
00:44:12,548 --> 00:44:14,016
- All at once?
- Exactly.

1261
00:44:14,017 --> 00:44:15,246
Right, all three questions.

1262
00:44:15,247 --> 00:44:16,647
I got it. For B, opposing.

1263
00:44:17,047 --> 00:44:18,387
For B, opposing.

1264
00:44:18,657 --> 00:44:20,017
- That is correct.
- Okay.

1265
00:44:20,887 --> 00:44:22,226
(Tae Hyun will also get to eat a dish.)

1266
00:44:22,227 --> 00:44:23,286
- "All truth is..." - For A,

1267
00:44:23,287 --> 00:44:24,957
- I got it. For A, - Go ahead.

1268
00:44:24,997 --> 00:44:26,156
Being betrayed.

1269
00:44:26,157 --> 00:44:27,396
- Betrayed?
- That's a good one.

1270
00:44:27,397 --> 00:44:28,496
(If this is correct, he'll get to eat...)

1271
00:44:28,497 --> 00:44:29,566
(both the dumpling and braised chicken.)

1272
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,667
That's correct.

1273
00:44:31,597 --> 00:44:32,966
(Answer for A: Betrayal)

1274
00:44:32,967 --> 00:44:33,967
Incorrect.

1275
00:44:33,968 --> 00:44:35,266
Isn't it something about hurting you?

1276
00:44:35,267 --> 00:44:36,436
- When told the truth...
- But...

1277
00:44:36,437 --> 00:44:37,836
I already got one right.

1278
00:44:37,837 --> 00:44:39,536
You could get two bites.

1279
00:44:39,537 --> 00:44:40,776
But I don't want that.

1280
00:44:40,777 --> 00:44:41,876
You'll eat after we're all done.

1281
00:44:41,877 --> 00:44:43,576
- The quiz isn't over yet.
- Once we're all done.

1282
00:44:43,577 --> 00:44:45,416
We can eat...

1283
00:44:45,417 --> 00:44:46,876
while he tries to answer it.

1284
00:44:46,877 --> 00:44:49,117
Tae Hyun, that's no way to work a show.

1285
00:44:49,347 --> 00:44:51,146
I was going to guess the next one while eating.

1286
00:44:51,147 --> 00:44:52,356
Hold on a second!

1287
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:53,416
Put that down!

1288
00:44:53,417 --> 00:44:55,327
(Gobbling)

1289
00:44:56,187 --> 00:44:57,486
Hold on a second!

1290
00:44:57,487 --> 00:44:59,127
Put that down!

1291
00:45:01,097 --> 00:45:02,697
Tae Hyun, come on!

1292
00:45:03,297 --> 00:45:05,967
You should've shut this down.

1293
00:45:06,037 --> 00:45:08,407
I was going to eat that, but you said I had to wait.

1294
00:45:09,137 --> 00:45:10,737
You looked like a thug just now.

1295
00:45:11,437 --> 00:45:13,036
(He doesn't care since it tastes good.)

1296
00:45:13,037 --> 00:45:14,507
- Isn't the dumpling tasty?
- Isn't it tasty?

1297
00:45:14,537 --> 00:45:15,746
- It's really good.
- I haven't had anything like it.

1298
00:45:15,747 --> 00:45:18,576
- I wanted that too.
- It's good.

1299
00:45:18,577 --> 00:45:19,646
Hold on a second.

1300
00:45:19,647 --> 00:45:21,046
- Why?
- Hold on.

1301
00:45:21,047 --> 00:45:22,317
But I got one right.

1302
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,846
Have this, then.

1303
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:26,786
- With that.
- Have it with that.

1304
00:45:26,787 --> 00:45:27,817
Of course.

1305
00:45:27,987 --> 00:45:29,126
And with this sauce.

1306
00:45:29,127 --> 00:45:31,186
You can have as much as you want.

1307
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:33,796
(Carefully)

1308
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:34,797
You do this a lot...

1309
00:45:34,897 --> 00:45:37,527
while eating meals.

1310
00:45:37,767 --> 00:45:39,197
- What is it?
- I think I get it.

1311
00:45:39,437 --> 00:45:41,197
- I got it. I was faster.
- I got it.

1312
00:45:41,437 --> 00:45:42,666
- He was faster.
- No, don't tell him.

1313
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:44,206
Answer for A, ridicule.

1314
00:45:44,207 --> 00:45:45,407
(Answer for A: Ridicule)

1315
00:45:45,607 --> 00:45:46,676
They told him that.

1316
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:48,306
- Seung Ho should get to eat.
- I'm having this.

1317
00:45:48,307 --> 00:45:49,647
(I'm having this!)

1318
00:45:50,607 --> 00:45:54,117
(In a split second, he stole Dong Hyun's chicken.)

1319
00:45:55,547 --> 00:45:56,717
Hurry up and finish that.

1320
00:45:57,217 --> 00:45:58,317
Go on.

1321
00:45:58,457 --> 00:46:00,416
Just so that I could have that,

1322
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:01,417
I got the chicken breast and...

1323
00:46:01,418 --> 00:46:03,427
(Tease-ya!)

1324
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:05,957
(Maxed out on dopamine)

1325
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:08,297
Isn't this him ridiculing me?

1326
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:11,197
It's like he's reaping what he sowed.

1327
00:46:11,797 --> 00:46:12,996
It's fine. There's more here.

1328
00:46:12,997 --> 00:46:13,997
Here you go.

1329
00:46:13,998 --> 00:46:15,966
- I'm fine.
- No, have it.

1330
00:46:15,967 --> 00:46:17,806
- Really?
- This is what I wanted anyway.

1331
00:46:17,807 --> 00:46:19,406
- The tteokbokki sauce...
- Go ahead.

1332
00:46:19,407 --> 00:46:20,906
I'm not having much.

1333
00:46:20,907 --> 00:46:22,847
- Just this.
- I see.

1334
00:46:24,107 --> 00:46:25,777
- He'll instantly know.
- He'll know the second he eats it.

1335
00:46:26,247 --> 00:46:28,117
(Yummy)

1336
00:46:28,217 --> 00:46:29,347
Isn't the sauce crazy?

1337
00:46:30,247 --> 00:46:31,386
There's something different...

1338
00:46:31,387 --> 00:46:32,517
- about this.
- Right?

1339
00:46:32,587 --> 00:46:34,287
- It's different.
- All...

1340
00:46:34,887 --> 00:46:35,987
the condiments...

1341
00:46:37,627 --> 00:46:38,696
- What the heck?
- What?

1342
00:46:38,697 --> 00:46:40,127
- Stop it.
- What?

1343
00:46:40,227 --> 00:46:42,226
- Only one.
- You're only allowed one.

1344
00:46:42,227 --> 00:46:43,227
Don't I get to stack one on top?

1345
00:46:43,228 --> 00:46:44,666
- No way.
- Just one.

1346
00:46:44,667 --> 00:46:45,966
How much are you trying to stack?

1347
00:46:45,967 --> 00:46:47,296
Some of it got stuck to my chopsticks.

1348
00:46:47,297 --> 00:46:51,307
(Some of it got stuck to my chopsticks.)

1349
00:46:51,707 --> 00:46:54,476
(A bite)

1350
00:46:54,477 --> 00:46:55,746
Why do I feel...

1351
00:46:55,747 --> 00:46:57,076
like he's teasing me?

1352
00:46:57,077 --> 00:46:58,206
(Why do I feel like he's teasing me?)

1353
00:46:58,207 --> 00:47:00,246
I've already had enough, but...

1354
00:47:00,247 --> 00:47:02,616
These are the three stages. First, it is ridiculed.

1355
00:47:02,617 --> 00:47:04,247
I felt ridiculed just now.

1356
00:47:04,417 --> 00:47:06,086
There was something annoying about how he said it.

1357
00:47:06,087 --> 00:47:07,957
(Yummy)

1358
00:47:08,357 --> 00:47:09,857
- It's not bitter, right?
- The flavors aren't strong.

1359
00:47:10,357 --> 00:47:11,486
The sauce goes so well...

1360
00:47:11,487 --> 00:47:12,627
- with the green onions.
- Right?

1361
00:47:12,757 --> 00:47:13,796
That combo is insane.

1362
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:16,126
- They combine inside your mouth.
- It's really good.

1363
00:47:16,127 --> 00:47:18,767
- The green onions are so good.
- It's really good.

1364
00:47:18,867 --> 00:47:19,896
(The satisfying freeloading session is over.)

1365
00:47:19,897 --> 00:47:21,036
- All right.
- I'm curious.

1366
00:47:21,037 --> 00:47:23,206
It's now time to see who'll pay the 84 dollars.

1367
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,506
Rather than answering a quiz,

1368
00:47:25,507 --> 00:47:27,076
- you could just pay the bill.
- We did that once.

1369
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:28,747
You can offer to pay the bill.

1370
00:47:28,877 --> 00:47:30,247
- That's a good idea.
- You're new on that team.

1371
00:47:30,477 --> 00:47:32,077
You had the drumstick and the wings...

1372
00:47:32,717 --> 00:47:34,616
I'm not that cool a guy.

1373
00:47:34,617 --> 00:47:36,717
(I'm not that cool a guy.)

1374
00:47:37,117 --> 00:47:39,457
I'm just a regular guy.

1375
00:47:39,917 --> 00:47:41,256
- So you'll do your best.
- Right.

1376
00:47:41,257 --> 00:47:42,586
Let's get it right the first time.

1377
00:47:42,587 --> 00:47:43,726
- That's more important.
- Okay.

1378
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:45,956
- Let's have the other team pay.
- We just have to get it right.

1379
00:47:45,957 --> 00:47:47,256
The three of us will work together.

1380
00:47:47,257 --> 00:47:48,826
- Go, Woo Il, go.
- Go!

1381
00:47:48,827 --> 00:47:49,827
Okay, good.

1382
00:47:49,828 --> 00:47:51,627
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

1383
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:54,436
In 2023, with the aim of eradicating...

1384
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:57,567
the South Korean manner of speech, North Korea implemented...

1385
00:47:57,767 --> 00:48:00,877
the Pyongyang Cultural Language Protection Law.

1386
00:48:00,907 --> 00:48:02,046
The Pyongyang Cultural Language Protection Law.

1387
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,706
The main clauses included...

1388
00:48:03,707 --> 00:48:05,347
the addition of "nim" to appellations,

1389
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:07,816
and also prohibited young men and women...

1390
00:48:07,817 --> 00:48:09,286
from using this South Korean expression...

1391
00:48:09,287 --> 00:48:11,116
when addressing each other.

1392
00:48:11,117 --> 00:48:13,087
Like adding "nim" to the end of a name?

1393
00:48:13,717 --> 00:48:15,387
What could this be?

1394
00:48:15,487 --> 00:48:17,286
- Young men and...
- After an appellation?

1395
00:48:17,287 --> 00:48:19,296
- Like "sajangnim?" - Yes.

1396
00:48:19,297 --> 00:48:20,797
Young men and women.

1397
00:48:21,497 --> 00:48:24,266
The answer must be something really obvious.

1398
00:48:24,267 --> 00:48:25,897
- Like "honey?" - Exactly.

1399
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:28,907
- Darling seems more plausible.
- Right, darling.

1400
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:31,437
Darling. Yes, darling sounds about right.

1401
00:48:31,467 --> 00:48:34,877
What did you and your girlfriend call each other?

1402
00:48:35,107 --> 00:48:36,946
Name and "ssi."

1403
00:48:36,947 --> 00:48:37,947
Name and "ssi?"

1404
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:40,177
- As a joke.
- That sounds like a good one.

1405
00:48:40,277 --> 00:48:41,816
- "Ssi" isn't so bad.
- The example was "nim,"

1406
00:48:41,817 --> 00:48:43,486
- so "ssi" sounds good.
- Since they rhyme?

1407
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,016
And rather than specifying couples, they referred to...

1408
00:48:45,017 --> 00:48:47,457
- young men and women.
- Yes, young men and women.

1409
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:48,586
Young men and women?

1410
00:48:48,587 --> 00:48:50,186
Then, shouldn't it be something trending?

1411
00:48:50,187 --> 00:48:51,387
Could it be something-ping?

1412
00:48:51,787 --> 00:48:52,926
- "Ping." - Right.

1413
00:48:52,927 --> 00:48:54,456
- You're right.
- "Ping."

1414
00:48:54,457 --> 00:48:56,127
- "Companionping." - "Ping."

1415
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,897
- "Yi Kyungping." - Gosh!

1416
00:48:58,197 --> 00:49:00,296
- "Billping." - "Waterping."

1417
00:49:00,297 --> 00:49:01,597
- "Ping?" - "Quizping."

1418
00:49:01,837 --> 00:49:04,307
- "Ping" is said often these days.
- This is "Quizping."

1419
00:49:04,807 --> 00:49:06,437
"Hurry up and come hereping!"

1420
00:49:07,737 --> 00:49:09,147
"This is from the Northping."

1421
00:49:11,077 --> 00:49:13,776
"I came as I wanted to see my Pings."

1422
00:49:13,777 --> 00:49:14,876
(Has Teenieping's popularity reached there too?)

1423
00:49:14,877 --> 00:49:15,947
"Ping" sounds like a good one.

1424
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:17,846
"Ping" might have a chance.

1425
00:49:17,847 --> 00:49:19,657
I think it's "ssi."

1426
00:49:20,057 --> 00:49:22,057
- "So-and-so ssi?" - You mentioned "ssi."

1427
00:49:22,187 --> 00:49:23,486
- I think it's "ssi." - I think so too.

1428
00:49:23,487 --> 00:49:25,656
- I think it's "ssi" too.
- The name goes before this.

1429
00:49:25,657 --> 00:49:26,657
"Ssi" makes sense.

1430
00:49:26,658 --> 00:49:27,996
- Is it one syllable?
- Let's say it together.

1431
00:49:27,997 --> 00:49:29,366
- One, two, three. "Ssi." - "Ssi."

1432
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:30,766
- Let's go for it.
- That's too obvious.

1433
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:32,337
It's "ssi" because "nim" was mentioned before that?

1434
00:49:32,367 --> 00:49:33,867
- Gosh, that's too obvious.
- Let's go for it right away.

1435
00:49:33,997 --> 00:49:36,607
"Ssi" that's added to someone's name.

1436
00:49:36,667 --> 00:49:38,737
Adding "ssi" to someone's name.

1437
00:49:39,137 --> 00:49:40,407
That is incorrect.

1438
00:49:42,007 --> 00:49:43,906
- They should go against each other.
- As individuals.

1439
00:49:43,907 --> 00:49:45,007
I got it. "Yi."

1440
00:49:45,277 --> 00:49:46,417
- What's "yi?" - "Yi?"

1441
00:49:46,747 --> 00:49:48,076
- "Sang Ukyi?" - Right.

1442
00:49:48,077 --> 00:49:49,217
That is incorrect.

1443
00:49:49,617 --> 00:49:50,646
- Gosh.
- Nice try.

1444
00:49:50,647 --> 00:49:52,056
I got it. "Darling."

1445
00:49:52,057 --> 00:49:53,087
"Darling."

1446
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:54,917
Incorrect.

1447
00:49:55,387 --> 00:49:56,726
It's not "darling?"

1448
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,026
- Hurry.
- "Honey."

1449
00:49:58,027 --> 00:50:00,256
(Answer: Honey)

1450
00:50:00,257 --> 00:50:01,257
"Honey."

1451
00:50:01,727 --> 00:50:02,966
- Incorrect.
- I got it.

1452
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:03,996
- Yes?
- "Ping."

1453
00:50:03,997 --> 00:50:06,296
(Ping)

1454
00:50:06,297 --> 00:50:07,297
He really wanted to say that one.

1455
00:50:07,298 --> 00:50:09,667
- It could be that.
- He really wanted to say that one.

1456
00:50:10,237 --> 00:50:11,937
- He really wanted to say that one.
- It could be that.

1457
00:50:12,077 --> 00:50:13,136
Incorrectping.

1458
00:50:13,137 --> 00:50:16,546
- It will get banned from now on.
- Incorrectping?

1459
00:50:16,547 --> 00:50:17,707
- Incorrectping.
- Incorrectping.

1460
00:50:17,847 --> 00:50:18,946
I got it. "Oppa."

1461
00:50:18,947 --> 00:50:19,947
(Answer: Oppa)

1462
00:50:19,948 --> 00:50:21,847
- Correct.
- Okay!

1463
00:50:22,217 --> 00:50:23,947
- Yi Kyung is good at this.
- Right.

1464
00:50:24,217 --> 00:50:25,556
- That makes sense.
- Right.

1465
00:50:25,557 --> 00:50:28,056
We should've thought in a simpler way.

1466
00:50:28,057 --> 00:50:29,757
- "Oppa." - Hold on.

1467
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:31,827
If Sang Uk loses, it'll be his second consecutive loss.

1468
00:50:32,327 --> 00:50:33,727
Or it could be our guest, Woo Il.

1469
00:50:34,097 --> 00:50:35,396
These two are the worst.

1470
00:50:35,397 --> 00:50:37,167
- Okay.
- The two are against each other.

1471
00:50:37,327 --> 00:50:38,896
- Here's the question for these two.
- You have to get this.

1472
00:50:38,897 --> 00:50:40,297
- It will be given right away.
- Here we go.

1473
00:50:40,667 --> 00:50:42,706
Yaksu-dong had been given its name...

1474
00:50:42,707 --> 00:50:44,837
as it was a place with good mineral water.

1475
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:46,636
- Really?
- Mineral water.

1476
00:50:46,637 --> 00:50:48,576
Right. There are many records...

1477
00:50:48,577 --> 00:50:51,046
of Sejong the Great treating skin and eye diseases...

1478
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:53,277
by washing himself with carbonic acid mineral water...

1479
00:50:53,447 --> 00:50:55,547
or drinking it.

1480
00:50:56,187 --> 00:50:58,117
After tasting the water,

1481
00:50:58,317 --> 00:51:01,557
Sejong the Great stated that the water tasted like "this..."

1482
00:51:01,657 --> 00:51:04,057
and called it "chosu."

1483
00:51:04,527 --> 00:51:06,797
- What is this?
- It tasted like "this?"

1484
00:51:07,957 --> 00:51:09,197
- "Chosu?" - Yes.

1485
00:51:10,527 --> 00:51:11,626
- I got it.
- Okay.

1486
00:51:11,627 --> 00:51:12,667
- He got it.
- Grass.

1487
00:51:12,967 --> 00:51:14,267
As "cho" means "grass" in the Chinese character.

1488
00:51:14,737 --> 00:51:15,806
- Incorrect.
- That's not it.

1489
00:51:15,807 --> 00:51:17,037
That was smart.

1490
00:51:17,837 --> 00:51:19,206
He thought it to be grass because of that character.

1491
00:51:19,207 --> 00:51:20,276
- I got it.
- Okay.

1492
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:21,977
- Vinegar.
- Vinegar?

1493
00:51:22,407 --> 00:51:24,847
- Vinegar.
- He thought of that one well.

1494
00:51:25,417 --> 00:51:26,417
(Answer: Vinegar)

1495
00:51:26,418 --> 00:51:27,447
Incorrect.

1496
00:51:27,647 --> 00:51:29,247
- I got it.
- It's back to square one now.

1497
00:51:29,617 --> 00:51:30,617
(Desperate)

1498
00:51:30,618 --> 00:51:31,647
Yes?

1499
00:51:31,847 --> 00:51:34,156
- Chogochujang?
- Chogochujang?

1500
00:51:34,157 --> 00:51:35,927
That must be really bad water. It'll taste spicy.

1501
00:51:36,187 --> 00:51:37,957
- Incorrect.
- Is it not that?

1502
00:51:38,357 --> 00:51:40,356
Isn't it sold at supermarkets?

1503
00:51:40,357 --> 00:51:41,426
- It's from a tree.
- No?

1504
00:51:41,427 --> 00:51:42,527
That must not be it.

1505
00:51:43,097 --> 00:51:44,166
I got it. Is it pepper?

1506
00:51:44,167 --> 00:51:45,196
(Answer: Pepper)

1507
00:51:45,197 --> 00:51:46,197
Correct.

1508
00:51:46,867 --> 00:51:48,067
It's pepper?

1509
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:49,766
Peppertree?

1510
00:51:49,767 --> 00:51:51,407
I thought it was mint.

1511
00:51:51,907 --> 00:51:53,877
I still have another chance, right?

1512
00:51:54,237 --> 00:51:55,277
It's over.

1513
00:51:56,307 --> 00:51:58,176
(What other chance?)

1514
00:51:58,177 --> 00:51:59,576
What other chance?

1515
00:51:59,577 --> 00:52:00,917
Doesn't this team have to play as well?

1516
00:52:02,847 --> 00:52:05,456
We solve the quiz when your team gets it right.

1517
00:52:05,457 --> 00:52:06,957
(He's in denial, even with the bill in his hand.)

1518
00:52:07,287 --> 00:52:09,126
So this team doesn't play again.

1519
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:10,626
We got the answer earlier.

1520
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,026
That was why it went over to your team.

1521
00:52:12,027 --> 00:52:13,856
Your team got the question wrong earlier.

1522
00:52:13,857 --> 00:52:15,466
I misunderstood the rules.

1523
00:52:15,467 --> 00:52:17,166
- I...
- I thought of pepper...

1524
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:18,936
and it tasted similar to carbonated water.

1525
00:52:18,937 --> 00:52:20,566
- Pepper was called...
- It's pepper.

1526
00:52:20,567 --> 00:52:21,967
"hocho" in the past.

1527
00:52:22,207 --> 00:52:23,636
That was why mineral water was called "chosu."

1528
00:52:23,637 --> 00:52:25,337
Pepper was called "hocho" in the past.

1529
00:52:25,837 --> 00:52:27,537
- Why do you have that look?
- Are you okay?

1530
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:30,506
Don't get me wrong.

1531
00:52:30,507 --> 00:52:33,016
I feel awful for not being able to get this simple question right.

1532
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:34,546
- That is why?
- We go through that every week.

1533
00:52:34,547 --> 00:52:35,547
I'm blaming myself.

1534
00:52:35,548 --> 00:52:36,716
We always go back home full of regret.

1535
00:52:36,717 --> 00:52:38,247
You didn't expect to pay at all today, right?

1536
00:52:38,487 --> 00:52:40,186
- Right.
- He's going to pay for everything.

1537
00:52:40,187 --> 00:52:41,386
- It has begun.
- It feels that way.

1538
00:52:41,387 --> 00:52:42,526
You said you won't feel stressed...

1539
00:52:42,527 --> 00:52:45,187
- It's already decided for you.
- even if you lose.

1540
00:52:45,327 --> 00:52:46,457
Rather than being like this,

1541
00:52:46,657 --> 00:52:49,266
- it would've been impressive...
- Right. That would've been nice.

1542
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:50,426
- to say that you would pay.
- That would make him look good.

1543
00:52:50,427 --> 00:52:51,526
That would've been so impressive.

1544
00:52:51,527 --> 00:52:52,936
Should we film this over?

1545
00:52:52,937 --> 00:52:54,466
- Should we do that?
- Should we go for that?

1546
00:52:54,467 --> 00:52:55,467
- Start things over.
- Shall we?

1547
00:52:55,468 --> 00:52:56,606
Tae Hyun, you do it.

1548
00:52:56,607 --> 00:52:57,637
He will say that he will pay.

1549
00:52:57,737 --> 00:53:01,176
Right. You should just pay without playing the game.

1550
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,646
- Right.
- Thank you.

1551
00:53:02,647 --> 00:53:04,406
It's just the two of them left.

1552
00:53:04,407 --> 00:53:05,776
- It's just 80 dollars.
- Right. It's 84 dollars.

1553
00:53:05,777 --> 00:53:06,847
(He looks at the younger ones.)

1554
00:53:08,377 --> 00:53:09,447
Let's go!

1555
00:53:12,857 --> 00:53:13,886
Okay. Thanks for getting this.

1556
00:53:13,887 --> 00:53:15,287
- Don't worry about it.
- Nice one!

1557
00:53:15,557 --> 00:53:17,226
- That's impressive!
- It's fine.

1558
00:53:17,227 --> 00:53:18,456
- It's fine.
- Is it really okay?

1559
00:53:18,457 --> 00:53:19,756
- It's fine.
- It should be done with the game.

1560
00:53:19,757 --> 00:53:21,057
- Forget about the game.
- That's impressive!

1561
00:53:21,397 --> 00:53:23,266
Here. The food was great.

1562
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:25,297
(A rare moment of Frugal Woo Il at the counter)

1563
00:53:26,037 --> 00:53:27,366
Should I place it here?

1564
00:53:27,367 --> 00:53:30,767
(Receipt: Total of 84 dollars)

1565
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:32,576
(Woo Il pays the bill.)

1566
00:53:32,577 --> 00:53:33,677
Right. Thank you.

1567
00:53:35,077 --> 00:53:38,976
(The sun slowly sets.)

1568
00:53:38,977 --> 00:53:41,246
How did it feel to eat all day while talking?

1569
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,617
- It was great.
- You even paid. How was it?

1570
00:53:45,287 --> 00:53:47,517
Did you enjoy the food you paid for?

1571
00:53:48,217 --> 00:53:49,657
The food was good.

1572
00:53:49,957 --> 00:53:52,327
I'm now determined to eat as much as I have paid.

1573
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:54,857
- There are two places left.
- Right.

1574
00:53:55,197 --> 00:53:56,566
You're going to make the most of the remaining places?

1575
00:53:56,567 --> 00:53:57,767
- Right.
- Great.

1576
00:53:57,967 --> 00:53:59,537
I know this place very well.

1577
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:01,797
- What is this place?
- From over there,

1578
00:54:02,167 --> 00:54:04,267
this place would look like an old alley.

1579
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,776
(It looks like a regular alley.)

1580
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:08,946
When the sun comes down,

1581
00:54:08,947 --> 00:54:10,607
- this place becomes amazing.
- Really?

1582
00:54:10,847 --> 00:54:12,216
It turns into the coolest place.

1583
00:54:12,217 --> 00:54:13,816
- It's unbelievable.
- This area?

1584
00:54:13,817 --> 00:54:15,046
- The atmosphere changes.
- This area?

1585
00:54:15,047 --> 00:54:16,386
- Really?
- Do you see the Central Market?

1586
00:54:16,387 --> 00:54:17,387
- Yes.
- Yes.

1587
00:54:17,388 --> 00:54:19,217
It goes up straight up from here.

1588
00:54:22,057 --> 00:54:24,126
(It's 1 of Seoul's top 3 markets.)

1589
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:28,296
(Sindang-dong's landmark, Central Market)

1590
00:54:28,297 --> 00:54:29,597
There's a place that sells...

1591
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:31,867
baked hotteok instead of fried hotteok.

1592
00:54:33,997 --> 00:54:35,836
When you buy different things at the market,

1593
00:54:35,837 --> 00:54:39,077
(Food bought at the market)

1594
00:54:40,037 --> 00:54:41,476
drinks are paired for you with it.

1595
00:54:41,477 --> 00:54:43,277
You can buy anything you want.

1596
00:54:43,677 --> 00:54:44,906
There are places where you can do that.

1597
00:54:44,907 --> 00:54:45,977
(Hot places that pair your food with drinks)

1598
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:49,617
- There are a lot of nice places.
- There are so many of them.

1599
00:54:50,887 --> 00:54:52,516
- How did you know?
- How did you know?

1600
00:54:52,517 --> 00:54:53,556
With how much he knows,

1601
00:54:53,557 --> 00:54:55,626
he seems to know more than a co-op of shopkeepers' president.

1602
00:54:55,627 --> 00:54:57,756
- He knows every place.
- He knows every place.

1603
00:54:57,757 --> 00:54:58,957
(Yi Kyung knows everything.)

1604
00:54:59,127 --> 00:55:00,626
- What will we have for dinner?
- Who will introduce...

1605
00:55:00,627 --> 00:55:02,397
the dinner menu in Sindang-dong?

1606
00:55:02,767 --> 00:55:04,367
The dinner menu in Sindang-dong...

1607
00:55:04,767 --> 00:55:06,936
- is dried fish.
- Dried fish?

1608
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:07,937
- Dried fish? They're dried?
- Fish?

1609
00:55:07,937 --> 00:55:08,937
They're dried?

1610
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,166
It must be that place.

1611
00:55:10,167 --> 00:55:12,166
- It must be the dried fish place.
- What's dried fish?

1612
00:55:12,167 --> 00:55:14,637
It's a place that sells half-dried fish.

1613
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:16,776
Their cuttlefish is really famous.

1614
00:55:16,777 --> 00:55:18,207
- Cuttlefish?
- I love cuttlefish.

1615
00:55:18,907 --> 00:55:20,317
Cuttlefish sounds good.

1616
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:23,717
It's dried fish and pork tripe hot pot.

1617
00:55:24,217 --> 00:55:26,357
- Pork tripe hot pot sounds good.
- Gosh, pork tripe hot pot.

1618
00:55:26,717 --> 00:55:30,187
Gen MZers get in long lines to have the pork tripe hot pot.

1619
00:55:30,957 --> 00:55:33,057
- I'm curious.
- I'm really curious.

1620
00:55:33,927 --> 00:55:36,127
(Today's dinner menu recommendation)

1621
00:55:36,327 --> 00:55:39,196
(Dried fish versus pork tripe hot pot)

1622
00:55:39,197 --> 00:55:41,266
Is there something you want more...

1623
00:55:41,267 --> 00:55:42,667
- out of these two, Woo Il?
- To be honest,

1624
00:55:43,067 --> 00:55:44,807
I really like tripe.

1625
00:55:44,937 --> 00:55:46,876
I especially like pork tripe.

1626
00:55:46,877 --> 00:55:48,976
I like the gamey smell...

1627
00:55:48,977 --> 00:55:50,506
- of pork tripe.
- The funky smell.

1628
00:55:50,507 --> 00:55:51,806
- Right.
- You like its funky smell.

1629
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,247
The ones that aren't clean?

1630
00:55:53,447 --> 00:55:55,846
Right. Slightly.

1631
00:55:55,847 --> 00:55:58,516
Then do you go and ask for the ones that aren't clean?

1632
00:55:58,517 --> 00:55:59,816
(Come on, Tae Hyun!)

1633
00:55:59,817 --> 00:56:01,356
- Why would he...
- Why would I...

1634
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:02,357
- Hold on.
- The ones that aren't clean?

1635
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:03,956
- Hold on.
- We'll ask for the dirty ones then.

1636
00:56:03,957 --> 00:56:05,556
- Or they can be eaten fresh.
- Hold on.

1637
00:56:05,557 --> 00:56:07,326
Let's ask for the ones that have just been butchered.

1638
00:56:07,327 --> 00:56:08,756
They can be served to the table right away.

1639
00:56:08,757 --> 00:56:10,326
The ones that haven't been cleaned.

1640
00:56:10,327 --> 00:56:12,797
I can't exactly ask them to undo the cleaning.

1641
00:56:13,097 --> 00:56:14,136
- There's no reason for that.
- You could...

1642
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:16,366
(So he doesn't like the dirty ones.)

1643
00:56:16,367 --> 00:56:19,107
We haven't decided yet. If I am to choose,

1644
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:21,277
we had some good tteobokki during the day,

1645
00:56:21,477 --> 00:56:23,446
so I will go for the healthy and delicious half-dried cuttlefish.

1646
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:25,006
- Right. I'd like that.
- For me...

1647
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:27,446
I really want the half-dried fish.

1648
00:56:27,447 --> 00:56:29,147
- Really?
- I came here before...

1649
00:56:29,417 --> 00:56:31,246
and wasn't able to have it, but today...

1650
00:56:31,247 --> 00:56:32,386
I wondered when I could have it.

1651
00:56:32,387 --> 00:56:33,616
So I'm definitely going for the half-dried fish today.

1652
00:56:33,617 --> 00:56:34,886
A lot of you guys are going for the half-dried fish.

1653
00:56:34,887 --> 00:56:36,887
I'm more familiar with pork tripe.

1654
00:56:37,087 --> 00:56:39,256
I'll go with the pork tripe.

1655
00:56:39,257 --> 00:56:40,357
As for me,

1656
00:56:40,957 --> 00:56:42,327
I've decided to control my diet,

1657
00:56:42,597 --> 00:56:44,227
so I'll go with the pork tripe hot pot.

1658
00:56:44,697 --> 00:56:46,036
- You're controlling your diet?
- What do we say to that?

1659
00:56:46,037 --> 00:56:47,196
- You're controlling your diet?
- Gosh.

1660
00:56:47,197 --> 00:56:48,636
It's not like you're going to just drink the soup.

1661
00:56:48,637 --> 00:56:50,607
I have my own rules.

1662
00:56:50,937 --> 00:56:52,266
- You have your own rules?
- Right.

1663
00:56:52,267 --> 00:56:53,636
(He'll have the pork tripe hot pot in a controlled manner.)

1664
00:56:53,637 --> 00:56:56,677
We talked about the pork tripe for a while just now.

1665
00:56:56,747 --> 00:56:59,377
- I've had the pork tripe often, - What?

1666
00:56:59,877 --> 00:57:01,877
So I want to try the dried fish.

1667
00:57:02,077 --> 00:57:03,517
- Okay then.
- What about you, Tae Hyun?

1668
00:57:04,017 --> 00:57:05,516
- The half-dried fish.
- Okay.

1669
00:57:05,517 --> 00:57:06,586
- The half-dried fish.
- It's 4 against 2.

1670
00:57:06,587 --> 00:57:08,087
- I'll go for the half-dried fish.
- It's 4 against 2.

1671
00:57:08,817 --> 00:57:10,727
The youngest two are on that side.

1672
00:57:11,627 --> 00:57:13,426
Where are we going first, Seung Ho?

1673
00:57:13,427 --> 00:57:14,497
Right now...

1674
00:57:15,497 --> 00:57:16,666
Can you smell it?

1675
00:57:16,667 --> 00:57:18,396
The dried fish is first.

1676
00:57:18,397 --> 00:57:19,636
Can you smell the fish?

1677
00:57:19,637 --> 00:57:20,896
- The dried fish is first.
- Really?

1678
00:57:20,897 --> 00:57:23,066
- He's guessing it by smell?
- He's guessing it by smell?

1679
00:57:23,067 --> 00:57:24,907
(Will Seung Ho be right?)

1680
00:57:25,007 --> 00:57:27,136
Our first dinner menu...

1681
00:57:27,137 --> 00:57:28,777
is just 40 steps away from us.

1682
00:57:28,977 --> 00:57:30,676
- It's the place I mentioned.
- It's the dried fish place.

1683
00:57:30,677 --> 00:57:32,047
- The dried fish place?
- It's right there.

1684
00:57:32,547 --> 00:57:34,016
- It's the dried fish place.
- It's right there.

1685
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,246
- He guessed it right?
- It's that one?

1686
00:57:35,247 --> 00:57:36,446
(They head to the dried fish place first as Seung Ho predicted.)

1687
00:57:36,447 --> 00:57:37,447
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1688
00:57:37,448 --> 00:57:38,517
Let's go.

1689
00:57:39,017 --> 00:57:40,816
- I've never heard of it.
- Same here.

1690
00:57:40,817 --> 00:57:41,986
I got so curious about it.

1691
00:57:41,987 --> 00:57:43,057
It's really famous.

1692
00:57:44,457 --> 00:57:46,057
All right. Let's go.

1693
00:57:46,497 --> 00:57:48,526
- Dried fish.
- Dried fish.

1694
00:57:48,527 --> 00:57:50,797
- It's nearby and I know this place.
- Okay.

1695
00:57:51,027 --> 00:57:52,937
There isn't a place that Yi Kyung doesn't know about.

1696
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:55,236
We happened to come to a place I already knew about.

1697
00:57:55,237 --> 00:57:56,937
It seems like he knows every single place.

1698
00:57:57,267 --> 00:57:58,436
This is where it is.

1699
00:57:58,437 --> 00:57:59,876
(They follow Yi Kyung.)

1700
00:57:59,877 --> 00:58:01,976
It's free as we've come at this hour.

1701
00:58:01,977 --> 00:58:03,046
I love markets.

1702
00:58:03,047 --> 00:58:04,447
- This is it.
- It's this place?

1703
00:58:05,047 --> 00:58:06,077
It's this place?

1704
00:58:06,747 --> 00:58:08,877
- It looks a lot bigger inside.
- Check that out.

1705
00:58:09,787 --> 00:58:11,486
(Sindang-dong Central Market)

1706
00:58:11,487 --> 00:58:14,517
(At one side, )

1707
00:58:14,957 --> 00:58:16,886
(you will find the dried fish restaurant...)

1708
00:58:16,887 --> 00:58:18,727
(that represents Seoul.)

1709
00:58:18,827 --> 00:58:20,256
(There's an endless line of customers waiting...)

1710
00:58:20,257 --> 00:58:21,657
(once the place opens.)

1711
00:58:22,157 --> 00:58:26,397
(The hottest place in Sindang-dong's Central Market.)

1712
00:58:28,197 --> 00:58:31,737
(Only wild-caught fish fresh from the sea is used.)

1713
00:58:32,267 --> 00:58:34,206
(Half-dried cuttlefish, )

1714
00:58:34,207 --> 00:58:36,476
(dried fish, )

1715
00:58:36,477 --> 00:58:38,947
(and even fish soup!)

1716
00:58:39,077 --> 00:58:42,147
(The place where you can feel the charms of the half-dried fish)

1717
00:58:42,487 --> 00:58:45,917
(DMR 1, dried fish)

1718
00:58:46,017 --> 00:58:48,387
I finally got to come here.

1719
00:58:48,887 --> 00:58:52,186
This place feels even busier now.

1720
00:58:52,187 --> 00:58:53,826
Is this your first time trying the food here after several visits?

1721
00:58:53,827 --> 00:58:55,727
I came here three times, but I've never been here.

1722
00:58:56,267 --> 00:58:57,397
This is amazing.

1723
00:58:57,897 --> 00:59:00,266
- It's amazing, isn't it?
- There are many different dishes.

1724
00:59:00,267 --> 00:59:01,936
- There are a lot of dishes.
- I just want...

1725
00:59:01,937 --> 00:59:03,406
But you must have the cuttlefish here.

1726
00:59:03,407 --> 00:59:04,567
That's a given.

1727
00:59:04,837 --> 00:59:06,236
I saw the cuttlefish being grilled in front.

1728
00:59:06,237 --> 00:59:07,706
The cuttlefish was piled up like a mountain.

1729
00:59:07,707 --> 00:59:08,907
- It's a must here.
- Okay.

1730
00:59:09,077 --> 00:59:12,547
Let's get a middle-sized steamed brown croaker,

1731
00:59:12,647 --> 00:59:14,546
a cuttlefish,

1732
00:59:14,547 --> 00:59:16,316
and a small-sized fried belted bearded grunt.

1733
00:59:16,317 --> 00:59:17,447
That sounds about right.

1734
00:59:17,617 --> 00:59:18,717
I don't think so.

1735
00:59:20,117 --> 00:59:21,556
Don't we need some soup too?

1736
00:59:21,557 --> 00:59:22,656
We must have soup...

1737
00:59:22,657 --> 00:59:24,286
- and a braised dish.
- We must have a soup?

1738
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:26,396
It would be great to have those dishes together.

1739
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:28,626
- Let's get the dried rockfish soup.
- Dried rockfish soup.

1740
00:59:28,627 --> 00:59:30,767
- We should also get a braised dish.
- A braised dish?

1741
00:59:30,897 --> 00:59:33,537
Why leave out the steamed dish? That's the main dish of this place.

1742
00:59:34,267 --> 00:59:35,866
(You're right.)

1743
00:59:35,867 --> 00:59:37,206
I think this will be a good choice.

1744
00:59:37,207 --> 00:59:39,736
- The pictures are behind us.
- What?

1745
00:59:39,737 --> 00:59:41,306
(Seung Ho decides to help them out.)

1746
00:59:41,307 --> 00:59:42,307
Cuttlefish?

1747
00:59:43,747 --> 00:59:46,447
- Gosh, that looks good.
- Hold on.

1748
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:48,777
Look at that.

1749
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:50,286
Can I stay at an Internet cafe for a while?

1750
00:59:50,287 --> 00:59:51,346
(Can I stay at an Internet cafe for a while?)

1751
00:59:51,347 --> 00:59:54,857
- I can't?
- We'll get a small steamed dish...

1752
00:59:54,917 --> 00:59:56,456
and a cuttlefish too.

1753
00:59:56,457 --> 00:59:59,156
The menu happened to be right above my head.

1754
00:59:59,157 --> 01:00:00,297
Do you know what I'm seeing?

1755
01:00:02,183 --> 01:00:04,882
The menu happened to be right above my head.

1756
01:00:04,883 --> 01:00:05,983
Do you know what I'm seeing?

1757
01:00:07,453 --> 01:00:08,722
(Laughing)

1758
01:00:08,723 --> 01:00:10,493
Show it to the camera.

1759
01:00:11,423 --> 01:00:13,223
(What did he get?)

1760
01:00:17,433 --> 01:00:18,733
I was looking at them,

1761
01:00:19,233 --> 01:00:21,163
and this was what I got.

1762
01:00:22,773 --> 01:00:24,433
- Here.
- Goodness.

1763
01:00:25,403 --> 01:00:26,843
Look at these two.

1764
01:00:26,943 --> 01:00:28,273
(Dumbfounded)

1765
01:00:28,343 --> 01:00:30,242
- That can't be helped.
- I kept seeing them...

1766
01:00:30,243 --> 01:00:32,012
- for five minutes.
- The menu is up there.

1767
01:00:32,013 --> 01:00:33,683
Their fingers moved up like this.

1768
01:00:34,043 --> 01:00:35,442
This won't get solved in a day.

1769
01:00:35,443 --> 01:00:37,752
Fine. Why don't we ask the owner...

1770
01:00:37,753 --> 01:00:40,253
- for a recommendation?
- Okay.

1771
01:00:40,323 --> 01:00:42,023
- Let's ask the owner.
- Right.

1772
01:00:42,583 --> 01:00:43,622
- Ma'am!
- Ma'am!

1773
01:00:43,623 --> 01:00:44,623
Yes.

1774
01:00:44,624 --> 01:00:45,722
(Someone who will save them from the menu selection)

1775
01:00:45,723 --> 01:00:46,992
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

1776
01:00:46,993 --> 01:00:50,093
- Hello. It's nice to meet you.
- Hello.

1777
01:00:50,233 --> 01:00:52,702
- The four of us will be eating.
- Right.

1778
01:00:52,703 --> 01:00:54,262
What will be suitable for us to have?

1779
01:00:54,263 --> 01:00:57,032
Everyone that comes here has the steamed dish...

1780
01:00:57,033 --> 01:00:58,572
- or the cuttlefish.
- Right.

1781
01:00:58,573 --> 01:00:59,902
Should we get the assorted steamed dish...

1782
01:00:59,903 --> 01:01:01,003
- or the individual dish?
- What would work for four people?

1783
01:01:01,203 --> 01:01:03,372
You should go for the brown croaker and get more if you need more.

1784
01:01:03,373 --> 01:01:05,472
We should get one soup.

1785
01:01:05,473 --> 01:01:09,612
If you don't like fishy soups, the monkfish soup is good too.

1786
01:01:09,613 --> 01:01:11,153
Monkfish? Monkfish is good.

1787
01:01:11,253 --> 01:01:13,282
We'll have the monkfish, the cuttlefish, and the steamed one.

1788
01:01:13,283 --> 01:01:14,752
(They finally get their order in.)

1789
01:01:14,753 --> 01:01:19,022
Is there a big difference in taste between regular fish and dried fish?

1790
01:01:19,023 --> 01:01:20,462
- How are they different?
- They are definitely different.

1791
01:01:20,463 --> 01:01:24,732
The half-dried fish are salted and dried.

1792
01:01:24,733 --> 01:01:27,332
As they are dried, different kinds of tastes...

1793
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:29,733
including bitter, sweet, and savory tastes are brought out.

1794
01:01:30,673 --> 01:01:33,442
There were so many chairs...

1795
01:01:33,443 --> 01:01:34,742
- at the entrance.
- Right.

1796
01:01:34,743 --> 01:01:36,512
There was a big area for people waiting.

1797
01:01:36,513 --> 01:01:38,672
People wait for two hours when it's really busy.

1798
01:01:38,673 --> 01:01:40,182
- Two hours?
- Even up to three hours.

1799
01:01:40,183 --> 01:01:41,812
I heard that...

1800
01:01:41,813 --> 01:01:43,182
it even takes up to an hour to get food to go.

1801
01:01:43,183 --> 01:01:44,883
- Right. It takes over an hour.
- Even for food to go?

1802
01:01:45,013 --> 01:01:46,822
- It takes that long.
- Right.

1803
01:01:46,823 --> 01:01:47,922
- Okay.
- Okay.

1804
01:01:47,923 --> 01:01:49,523
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1805
01:01:49,923 --> 01:01:51,093
Before we eat...

1806
01:01:51,223 --> 01:01:52,593
(What is he asking about?)

1807
01:01:52,993 --> 01:01:55,022
Could you slightly show us...

1808
01:01:55,023 --> 01:01:56,132
the face of the Japanese man?

1809
01:01:56,133 --> 01:01:57,232
- I wondered if...
- The Japanese man?

1810
01:01:57,233 --> 01:01:58,832
He could really do it because I watched your videos.

1811
01:01:58,833 --> 01:01:59,902
- Do you know what it is?
- I do.

1812
01:01:59,903 --> 01:02:00,932
He scrunched up his face like this.

1813
01:02:00,933 --> 01:02:03,302
He made others laugh with that face.

1814
01:02:03,303 --> 01:02:04,803
I should do it before the food gets served.

1815
01:02:04,873 --> 01:02:06,202
Could you slightly show us? I'm really curious.

1816
01:02:06,203 --> 01:02:10,173
(It's important to have the nose and lower lip touch.)

1817
01:02:13,283 --> 01:02:15,383
(Old Woo Il is here.)

1818
01:02:16,353 --> 01:02:17,353
(He's 10,000 percent in sync.)

1819
01:02:17,354 --> 01:02:18,552
- He looks just like him.
- How can you make...

1820
01:02:18,553 --> 01:02:19,653
your lower lip touch your nose?

1821
01:02:20,623 --> 01:02:22,523
(I want to give it a try too.)

1822
01:02:22,623 --> 01:02:24,323
How can you make your lower lip touch your nose?

1823
01:02:24,693 --> 01:02:25,723
I can do it.

1824
01:02:26,393 --> 01:02:28,563
It has to be your lower lip.

1825
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:30,793
- What?
- It's his lower lip.

1826
01:02:31,863 --> 01:02:34,002
- Gosh.
- I can't do it.

1827
01:02:34,003 --> 01:02:35,032
The nose moves in.

1828
01:02:35,033 --> 01:02:36,172
Gosh, how did you do that?

1829
01:02:36,173 --> 01:02:37,702
(They all give it a try.)

1830
01:02:37,703 --> 01:02:39,233
(Is it done like this?)

1831
01:02:39,403 --> 01:02:40,542
That was fascinating.

1832
01:02:40,543 --> 01:02:42,843
(Greatly satisfied by his friend's talent)

1833
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,843
You two are the same age but never speak casually.

1834
01:02:45,143 --> 01:02:47,583
Just in case he might've tricked us with his age.

1835
01:02:47,713 --> 01:02:50,082
(A suspicion that was sparked from the opening)

1836
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:51,252
- Who?
- You.

1837
01:02:51,253 --> 01:02:52,553
(Me?)

1838
01:02:52,713 --> 01:02:54,282
In which month were you born?

1839
01:02:54,283 --> 01:02:56,082
- November.
- November.

1840
01:02:56,083 --> 01:02:57,523
- I was born in July.
- You're older.

1841
01:02:57,723 --> 01:02:59,492
- What are you saying?
- Come on.

1842
01:02:59,493 --> 01:03:01,592
- We were born in the same year.
- Right.

1843
01:03:01,593 --> 01:03:02,593
(Can the two of us become friends?)

1844
01:03:03,963 --> 01:03:05,093
Is that the cuttlefish?

1845
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,202
- That's...
- The middle size.

1846
01:03:07,203 --> 01:03:08,533
- It's the middle size?
- Yes.

1847
01:03:08,903 --> 01:03:10,073
The middle size is this big?

1848
01:03:10,273 --> 01:03:11,303
Gosh, I didn't know.

1849
01:03:11,773 --> 01:03:13,142
- Please move it over.
- To the left.

1850
01:03:13,143 --> 01:03:15,542
- This much is served?
- Gosh, this is a lot.

1851
01:03:15,543 --> 01:03:16,643
Let's share it.

1852
01:03:17,573 --> 01:03:19,373
It's this cheap?

1853
01:03:21,643 --> 01:03:23,782
(On top of the chewy meat, )

1854
01:03:23,783 --> 01:03:27,083
(the scent of the charcoal gets added.)

1855
01:03:28,653 --> 01:03:30,422
(Crispy on the outside...)

1856
01:03:30,423 --> 01:03:32,253
(and chewy on the inside)

1857
01:03:32,693 --> 01:03:35,662
(Grilled cuttlefish)

1858
01:03:35,663 --> 01:03:37,493
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

1859
01:03:38,033 --> 01:03:40,362
- It's stacked up like this?
- Hold on.

1860
01:03:40,363 --> 01:03:42,873
- Shall we?
- Right. It already...

1861
01:03:43,403 --> 01:03:44,573
It already feels clean.

1862
01:03:44,633 --> 01:03:46,303
- Shall we start with the quiz?
- Let's start with the quiz.

1863
01:03:46,473 --> 01:03:49,242
- We haven't even tried it yet.
- Nothing else.

1864
01:03:49,243 --> 01:03:50,342
It will be just for a bite of that.

1865
01:03:50,343 --> 01:03:52,042
(The younger ones get impatient at the insane look of the dish.)

1866
01:03:52,043 --> 01:03:53,282
Look at how thick it is. Gosh.

1867
01:03:53,283 --> 01:03:55,343
It smells just like home-cooked grilled cuttlefish.

1868
01:03:56,853 --> 01:03:59,482
(Taking a good bite of it)

1869
01:03:59,483 --> 01:04:01,483
- Is it different from butter?
- Yes.

1870
01:04:03,223 --> 01:04:05,152
The scent of the cuttlefish isn't too strong.

1871
01:04:05,153 --> 01:04:07,263
It tastes like fresh raw cuttlefish.

1872
01:04:07,323 --> 01:04:08,323
You can see how bouncy the meat is, right?

1873
01:04:08,323 --> 01:04:09,323
(Bouncy)

1874
01:04:09,633 --> 01:04:10,692
- This is protein.
- Totally.

1875
01:04:10,693 --> 01:04:12,903
- This is protein.
- It's easily absorbed by the body.

1876
01:04:16,103 --> 01:04:17,873
(Amazed)

1877
01:04:18,203 --> 01:04:21,773
(He takes a bite with the sauce this time.)

1878
01:04:23,343 --> 01:04:25,443
(Chewing)

1879
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,442
(The eldest takes a bite as well.)

1880
01:04:29,443 --> 01:04:30,513
- It's delicious.
- It tastes like...

1881
01:04:31,953 --> 01:04:34,423
The texture is important and there were cuts made.

1882
01:04:34,523 --> 01:04:37,293
The meat tears apart in your mouth as you chew it.

1883
01:04:38,393 --> 01:04:39,592
It's really chewy.

1884
01:04:39,593 --> 01:04:41,492
(The meat is full of flavor thanks to the cuts.)

1885
01:04:41,493 --> 01:04:43,032
I'll just take a look at it.

1886
01:04:43,033 --> 01:04:44,233
I really won't put it into my mouth.

1887
01:04:44,733 --> 01:04:46,933
I really won't.

1888
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:48,603
(Teasing him)

1889
01:04:49,333 --> 01:04:51,202
(Boiling up)

1890
01:04:51,203 --> 01:04:52,303
You can't trick me twice.

1891
01:04:52,973 --> 01:04:54,573
(Mixing up)

1892
01:04:54,643 --> 01:04:57,372
The sauce has mayonnaise and Cheongyang chilis.

1893
01:04:57,373 --> 01:04:58,943
It's the perfect dish to have with beer.

1894
01:04:59,043 --> 01:05:02,312
- Right. This is perfect with beer.
- It'll be perfect with beer.

1895
01:05:02,313 --> 01:05:03,413
- We should get some beer then.
- Right.

1896
01:05:03,713 --> 01:05:06,152
Can we get a bottle of beer with four glasses?

1897
01:05:06,153 --> 01:05:07,283
Okay.

1898
01:05:07,453 --> 01:05:09,282
- Gosh.
- We'll each get a glass.

1899
01:05:09,283 --> 01:05:10,593
(Feeling jealous)

1900
01:05:11,393 --> 01:05:13,062
Say something for us, Woo Il.

1901
01:05:13,063 --> 01:05:14,893
(The toast happens naturally.)

1902
01:05:15,393 --> 01:05:18,133
Here's to the eternal happiness of Handsome Guys.

1903
01:05:21,033 --> 01:05:22,432
(Reading the room)

1904
01:05:22,433 --> 01:05:24,233
(Clinking)

1905
01:05:24,573 --> 01:05:25,873
Say something for us, Tae Hyun.

1906
01:05:26,773 --> 01:05:28,802
- Would you like to try again?
- Must it be something amazing?

1907
01:05:28,803 --> 01:05:30,072
- No.
- No.

1908
01:05:30,073 --> 01:05:31,212
- Go for it.
- Thank you.

1909
01:05:31,213 --> 01:05:32,213
Well...

1910
01:05:32,213 --> 01:05:33,213
(How about this?)

1911
01:05:33,214 --> 01:05:34,342
I'll say, "Let's get closer, Dong Hyun."

1912
01:05:34,343 --> 01:05:35,382
And you guys can say, "Get closer together."

1913
01:05:35,383 --> 01:05:36,453
Okay.

1914
01:05:36,753 --> 01:05:38,352
Let's get closer, Dong Hyun.

1915
01:05:38,353 --> 01:05:39,783
- Get closer together.
- Get closer together.

1916
01:05:40,153 --> 01:05:41,352
That was great.

1917
01:05:41,353 --> 01:05:42,753
- Gosh.
- "Get closer together."

1918
01:05:43,023 --> 01:05:44,193
You two should speak casually with each other now.

1919
01:05:44,893 --> 01:05:46,593
- Right. Let's do that.
- Sure.

1920
01:05:47,123 --> 01:05:48,823
Let's speak casually. My friend, Woo Il.

1921
01:05:49,933 --> 01:05:51,432
How about getting a noogie whenever you speak formally?

1922
01:05:51,433 --> 01:05:52,463
- Right.
- That sounds good.

1923
01:05:52,693 --> 01:05:54,562
- Speak casually from now on.
- Okay.

1924
01:05:54,563 --> 01:05:56,233
- One, two, three!
- Start!

1925
01:06:01,203 --> 01:06:04,212
You two have to talk.

1926
01:06:04,213 --> 01:06:06,073
- You can't keep silent.
- Right.

1927
01:06:06,113 --> 01:06:07,383
What do you want, Dong Hyun?

1928
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:11,213
How does the seasoned steamed dish sound?

1929
01:06:12,713 --> 01:06:14,052
(These two really don't want to get a noogie.)

1930
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,783
- "How does that sound?" - "How does that sound?

1931
01:06:16,053 --> 01:06:17,822
They sound like two foreigners...

1932
01:06:17,823 --> 01:06:19,963
who have visited a Korean language school.

1933
01:06:20,993 --> 01:06:21,993
How are things these days?

1934
01:06:23,233 --> 01:06:24,462
(Embarrassed)

1935
01:06:24,463 --> 01:06:25,832
(Feeling awkward)

1936
01:06:25,833 --> 01:06:27,162
"How are things these days?"

1937
01:06:27,163 --> 01:06:28,403
(So funny)

1938
01:06:28,903 --> 01:06:31,403
Of all the things I've said lately, that was the worst.

1939
01:06:31,903 --> 01:06:33,842
- "How are things these days?" - "How are things these days?"

1940
01:06:33,843 --> 01:06:34,903
(Will these two be able to be free from noogies today?)

1941
01:06:35,673 --> 01:06:36,972
(A new dish gets served.)

1942
01:06:36,973 --> 01:06:38,113
Okay.

1943
01:06:38,443 --> 01:06:39,473
What is that?

1944
01:06:39,843 --> 01:06:41,943
- It's the steamed brown croaker.
- What is this?

1945
01:06:42,443 --> 01:06:43,552
This is awesome!

1946
01:06:43,553 --> 01:06:47,453
(The dried fish was brought from the producing area.)

1947
01:06:48,253 --> 01:06:52,822
(The brown croaker gets added to the steamer...)

1948
01:06:52,823 --> 01:06:56,263
(along with colorful vegetables.)

1949
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:01,233
(The half-dried brown croaker steamed in high heat)

1950
01:07:01,803 --> 01:07:06,233
(It's paired with a sweet and sour cabbage salad.)

1951
01:07:07,303 --> 01:07:10,373
(Steamed brown croaker)

1952
01:07:11,113 --> 01:07:12,813
- It's already seasoned, right?
- At first, it looked thin...

1953
01:07:12,943 --> 01:07:14,283
as it was dried.

1954
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:16,913
(The chopsticks get competitive.)

1955
01:07:19,253 --> 01:07:21,223
Did it have that much meat earlier?

1956
01:07:22,053 --> 01:07:23,693
- It looks really nice.
- But...

1957
01:07:28,993 --> 01:07:31,062
So this is the charm of half-dried fish.

1958
01:07:31,063 --> 01:07:32,092
It has a sticky texture.

1959
01:07:32,093 --> 01:07:33,963
(Chewing)

1960
01:07:34,063 --> 01:07:36,533
It's like the dried yellow corvina. The meat comes off like this.

1961
01:07:36,673 --> 01:07:40,303
(The bones of the brown croaker get removed.)

1962
01:07:40,873 --> 01:07:42,803
Eating off that part must taste really good.

1963
01:07:45,573 --> 01:07:46,642
Done.

1964
01:07:46,643 --> 01:07:51,483
(Taking a big bite of the meat torn off)

1965
01:07:52,953 --> 01:07:54,522
- It's plump.
- Seriously.

1966
01:07:54,523 --> 01:07:55,953
(It's plump.)

1967
01:07:56,353 --> 01:07:58,223
- It's slick.
- Definitely.

1968
01:07:58,293 --> 01:07:59,752
The flesh is very chewy.

1969
01:07:59,753 --> 01:08:01,362
- I get why people eat it.
- Yes.

1970
01:08:01,363 --> 01:08:02,423
It's like...

1971
01:08:03,563 --> 01:08:05,662
- barley-aged dried yellow corvina.
- That's right.

1972
01:08:05,663 --> 01:08:07,032
There's a deep aroma.

1973
01:08:07,033 --> 01:08:09,103
- Flavors?
- Yes, You know,

1974
01:08:09,873 --> 01:08:11,172
it's the aroma of dried fish.

1975
01:08:11,173 --> 01:08:12,672
What came from the sea...

1976
01:08:12,673 --> 01:08:14,103
has been dried with sea breeze.

1977
01:08:16,713 --> 01:08:18,042
Since it's half-dried,

1978
01:08:18,043 --> 01:08:19,643
I can feel the flesh in my mouth.

1979
01:08:20,013 --> 01:08:21,243
It doesn't break...

1980
01:08:21,343 --> 01:08:23,383
or melt like that of a regular fish.

1981
01:08:23,483 --> 01:08:26,653
I can chew it since it remains firm in my mouth.

1982
01:08:26,883 --> 01:08:28,153
It's soup.

1983
01:08:29,123 --> 01:08:30,222
Please put it here.

1984
01:08:30,223 --> 01:08:32,023
(After a long wait, they receive monkfish soup.)

1985
01:08:32,523 --> 01:08:34,492
Gosh, this is monkfish.

1986
01:08:34,493 --> 01:08:35,562
Yes, it's monkfish soup.

1987
01:08:35,563 --> 01:08:36,963
- The size is so...
- It's a bit...

1988
01:08:37,563 --> 01:08:40,533
(The fragrant spring water parsley...)

1989
01:08:42,003 --> 01:08:45,273
(and plump monkfish meet.)

1990
01:08:47,073 --> 01:08:49,842
(Monkfish soup)

1991
01:08:49,843 --> 01:08:51,413
We can eat water parsley now.

1992
01:08:51,713 --> 01:08:53,512
The duck restaurant owner said that water parsley became tough...

1993
01:08:53,513 --> 01:08:55,113
- if you boiled it for too long.
- That's right.

1994
01:08:56,583 --> 01:08:59,383
Dong Hyun, don't you like the tail?

1995
01:08:59,483 --> 01:09:00,652
No, I don't.

1996
01:09:00,653 --> 01:09:01,653
- No?
- No.

1997
01:09:01,654 --> 01:09:03,153
The water parsley is refreshing.

1998
01:09:03,223 --> 01:09:05,192
It's refreshing.

1999
01:09:05,193 --> 01:09:07,562
(He fills the bowl with the soup.)

2000
01:09:07,563 --> 01:09:08,823
- All right.
- It's Yi Kyung's.

2001
01:09:09,893 --> 01:09:11,032
The fish.

2002
01:09:11,033 --> 01:09:12,293
I'll give you a lot of fish.

2003
01:09:12,633 --> 01:09:14,503
The soup and fish are two different things.

2004
01:09:14,763 --> 01:09:15,763
(Impressed)

2005
01:09:15,863 --> 01:09:17,272
This is my cup of tea.

2006
01:09:17,273 --> 01:09:18,702
- It's totally refreshing.
- Is it refreshing?

2007
01:09:18,703 --> 01:09:19,942
It's so refreshing.

2008
01:09:19,943 --> 01:09:21,672
(The refreshing spoonful of soup...)

2009
01:09:21,673 --> 01:09:23,543
(puts a smile on his face.)

2010
01:09:24,273 --> 01:09:26,273
Look at how these things are standing up.

2011
01:09:26,583 --> 01:09:28,813
Bones. Flesh. I mean, bones.

2012
01:09:29,513 --> 01:09:30,583
Oh, my.

2013
01:09:32,083 --> 01:09:33,982
- Do you eat the bones as well?
- There are no bones.

2014
01:09:33,983 --> 01:09:36,123
I think I saw that in childhood on "The Gods Must Be Crazy."

2015
01:09:38,453 --> 01:09:41,392
(The soup that settles the stomach...)

2016
01:09:41,393 --> 01:09:44,433
(and the plump flesh create an incredible harmony.)

2017
01:09:45,133 --> 01:09:47,862
You know the dried yellow corvina from Yeonggwang, right?

2018
01:09:47,863 --> 01:09:48,863
It's like dried yellow corvina.

2019
01:09:48,864 --> 01:09:50,472
It's oily and chewy.

2020
01:09:50,473 --> 01:09:51,502
It has the texture of dried yellow corvina.

2021
01:09:51,503 --> 01:09:52,533
But it's bigger.

2022
01:09:52,903 --> 01:09:56,003
Do you know how Yeonggwang dried yellow corvina gets its name?

2023
01:09:56,373 --> 01:09:57,842
- How?
- Even if it's caught...

2024
01:09:57,843 --> 01:09:59,313
in the same sea,

2025
01:09:59,343 --> 01:10:02,083
the port through which it enters determines its name.

2026
01:10:02,543 --> 01:10:03,612
If it enters through Yeonggwang,

2027
01:10:03,613 --> 01:10:04,712
it's Yeonggwang dried yellow corvina.

2028
01:10:04,713 --> 01:10:06,983
If it enters through Gunsan, it's Gunsan dried yellow corvina.

2029
01:10:07,053 --> 01:10:09,383
But I've never heard of Gunsan dried yellow corvina.

2030
01:10:09,953 --> 01:10:11,693
- So...
- Have you eaten such a thing?

2031
01:10:12,053 --> 01:10:13,053
No, I haven't.

2032
01:10:14,723 --> 01:10:16,763
- Are you squeezing out knowledge?
- No.

2033
01:10:16,833 --> 01:10:19,293
I've never heard of Gunsan dried yellow corvina.

2034
01:10:19,763 --> 01:10:20,803
Right?

2035
01:10:20,963 --> 01:10:22,462
(However)

2036
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:24,303
Why do you attack me...

2037
01:10:24,673 --> 01:10:25,873
whenever I say something?

2038
01:10:27,073 --> 01:10:28,442
You used a polite tone.

2039
01:10:28,443 --> 01:10:30,512
- No, I was talking to Tae Hyun.
- You weren't looking at me.

2040
01:10:30,513 --> 01:10:31,513
- I mean...
- You were looking at me.

2041
01:10:31,514 --> 01:10:33,143
- He definitely used a polite tone.
- Yes.

2042
01:10:33,283 --> 01:10:35,082
- Let's give him a noogie.
- No.

2043
01:10:35,083 --> 01:10:37,552
- A noogie.
- No.

2044
01:10:37,553 --> 01:10:40,353
- Let's give him a noogie.
- No.

2045
01:10:40,553 --> 01:10:41,852
- What?
- A noogie.

2046
01:10:41,853 --> 01:10:42,922
- He needs a noogie.
- What?

2047
01:10:42,923 --> 01:10:44,493
- What's wrong, Dong Hyun?
- Well,

2048
01:10:44,693 --> 01:10:46,192
you looked at me while you were talking.

2049
01:10:46,193 --> 01:10:47,422
That's right. He should get a noogie,

2050
01:10:47,423 --> 01:10:48,492
- right?
- Seriously.

2051
01:10:48,493 --> 01:10:50,563
He definitely didn't look at me.

2052
01:10:51,133 --> 01:10:52,332
I've watched...

2053
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:54,263
a clip of someone who passed out because of a noogie from him.

2054
01:10:54,703 --> 01:10:56,162
That was Choo Sung Hoon. I'm really weak.

2055
01:10:56,163 --> 01:10:58,002
- Then give it your 30 percent.
- What?

2056
01:10:58,003 --> 01:10:59,502
Even if I give it my 100 percent, it'll be weak.

2057
01:10:59,503 --> 01:11:00,872
- I bet you're stronger.
- No.

2058
01:11:00,873 --> 01:11:02,403
- Now...
- Number one.

2059
01:11:03,073 --> 01:11:04,412
Number two.

2060
01:11:04,413 --> 01:11:05,443
Number three.

2061
01:11:05,943 --> 01:11:07,013
Number four.

2062
01:11:07,343 --> 01:11:08,882
- My goodness.
- Which one will it be?

2063
01:11:08,883 --> 01:11:10,482
(He's faced with a killer question.)

2064
01:11:10,483 --> 01:11:11,553
I'm so torn.

2065
01:11:12,353 --> 01:11:13,652
There's this option.

2066
01:11:13,653 --> 01:11:14,983
- Number 5.
- Number 5?

2067
01:11:15,623 --> 01:11:17,152
- If you pass out...
- If I choose this,

2068
01:11:17,153 --> 01:11:19,353
- I'll need a colonoscopy afterward.
- Right.

2069
01:11:19,893 --> 01:11:21,962
If you choose this, you won't feel any pain.

2070
01:11:21,963 --> 01:11:23,062
- Seriously.
- You'll pass out.

2071
01:11:23,063 --> 01:11:24,663
- I don't think I'll wake up.
- Seriously.

2072
01:11:24,733 --> 01:11:25,892
Give me which number you want.

2073
01:11:25,893 --> 01:11:28,333
I want this one. I think this one is the best.

2074
01:11:29,033 --> 01:11:30,733
- This one? Okay.
- Let's see a demonstration.

2075
01:11:32,173 --> 01:11:33,233
What was that?

2076
01:11:33,573 --> 01:11:35,503
That might happen. I'm sorry.

2077
01:11:36,103 --> 01:11:37,112
What was that?

2078
01:11:37,113 --> 01:11:40,543
(He didn't expect the modified version.)

2079
01:11:41,243 --> 01:11:42,312
I'm sorry.

2080
01:11:42,313 --> 01:11:43,553
This is just the beginning.

2081
01:11:43,583 --> 01:11:45,013
This is just the beginning.

2082
01:11:46,013 --> 01:11:47,082
- Is it like that for every option?
- Yes.

2083
01:11:47,083 --> 01:11:48,323
- This is just the beginning.
- Yes.

2084
01:11:48,723 --> 01:11:50,553
- Will it end with a punch?
- As for this one...

2085
01:11:50,853 --> 01:11:51,853
As for this one,

2086
01:11:51,854 --> 01:11:52,893
it'll end like this.

2087
01:11:53,523 --> 01:11:55,523
(He'll be knocked out.)

2088
01:11:55,793 --> 01:11:57,763
I'm sorry. You shouldn't fall for it.

2089
01:11:57,833 --> 01:11:59,093
I'm sorry. Which one do you want?

2090
01:11:59,163 --> 01:12:00,163
This one or this one?

2091
01:12:00,903 --> 01:12:02,802
No matter what I choose,

2092
01:12:02,803 --> 01:12:04,903
- I'll get a colonoscopy.
- Yes.

2093
01:12:04,933 --> 01:12:07,072
- No matter what I choose...
- It'll be strange to do this.

2094
01:12:07,073 --> 01:12:08,773
It's time for me to get a medical checkup, but...

2095
01:12:10,143 --> 01:12:11,442
- It'll be strange to do this.
- You know,

2096
01:12:11,443 --> 01:12:13,072
Dong Hyun has done this a few times.

2097
01:12:13,073 --> 01:12:15,212
He'll do this one for real.

2098
01:12:15,213 --> 01:12:16,783
- I'll keep it light.
- Okay.

2099
01:12:16,853 --> 01:12:17,912
- I'll keep it light.
- Okay.

2100
01:12:17,913 --> 01:12:19,512
- This one will be really weak.
- Don't hit my eyes.

2101
01:12:19,513 --> 01:12:20,552
Okay.

2102
01:12:20,553 --> 01:12:21,652
- Like this?
- Hold on.

2103
01:12:21,653 --> 01:12:22,852
- Hold on.
- Like this?

2104
01:12:22,853 --> 01:12:23,922
- You'll get hurt if you move.
- Like this? What should I do?

2105
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:25,092
- What will you do?
- Just the forehead.

2106
01:12:25,093 --> 01:12:28,163
(How are Dong Hyun's skills in giving a noogie?)

2107
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:32,792
Gosh, it was a good one.

2108
01:12:32,793 --> 01:12:33,863
(Teary-eyed)

2109
01:12:34,203 --> 01:12:35,302
(What?)

2110
01:12:35,303 --> 01:12:37,703
Gosh, it was a good one.

2111
01:12:38,573 --> 01:12:41,272
It was the hardest noogie I've given in my life.

2112
01:12:41,273 --> 01:12:42,572
(It was the hardest noogie I've given in my life.)

2113
01:12:42,573 --> 01:12:44,712
I guess we have good teamwork.

2114
01:12:44,713 --> 01:12:46,212
- It was good.
- I put so much strength into it.

2115
01:12:46,213 --> 01:12:47,813
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

2116
01:12:48,683 --> 01:12:50,082
Who wants the next noogie?

2117
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:51,613
(Who wants the next noogie?)

2118
01:12:51,683 --> 01:12:52,882
- Just don't use a polite tone.
- Just don't use a polite tone.

2119
01:12:52,883 --> 01:12:53,953
Okay.

2120
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:55,623
- It was my mistake.
- Yes.

2121
01:12:55,953 --> 01:12:57,023
It was my mistake.

2122
01:12:57,793 --> 01:12:59,353
I feel like you guys have become really close.

2123
01:12:59,823 --> 01:13:01,622
- We've become close for real.
- I know. It's different now.

2124
01:13:01,623 --> 01:13:02,722
- Good.
- Yes.

2125
01:13:02,723 --> 01:13:04,263
(A noogie completed their friendship.)

2126
01:13:04,463 --> 01:13:05,832
(After the meal, the bill gets delivered.)

2127
01:13:05,833 --> 01:13:06,903
Thank you.

2128
01:13:07,103 --> 01:13:08,632
How much is the total, Seung Ho?

2129
01:13:08,633 --> 01:13:11,272
- It's such a clean number.
- Is it 200 dollars?

2130
01:13:11,273 --> 01:13:12,373
It's exactly 200 dollars.

2131
01:13:13,103 --> 01:13:14,872
Two hundred dollars.

2132
01:13:14,873 --> 01:13:17,673
Please give us a quiz for the 200-dollar receipt.

2133
01:13:17,943 --> 01:13:21,183
Okay. Here's a quiz for the fish restaurant.

2134
01:13:21,583 --> 01:13:23,552
In "Half-dried," the Chinese character...

2135
01:13:23,553 --> 01:13:25,752
for "Dried" is "Geon."

2136
01:13:25,753 --> 01:13:26,883
Yes.

2137
01:13:27,053 --> 01:13:28,152
- Yes.
- That's right.

2138
01:13:28,153 --> 01:13:30,192
From the following,

2139
01:13:30,193 --> 01:13:33,523
please pick all the choices that contain "Geon" for "Dried."

2140
01:13:33,963 --> 01:13:35,292
We need to pick all the choices,

2141
01:13:35,293 --> 01:13:36,663
- not one incorrect choice.
- "Geon" for "Dried."

2142
01:13:37,363 --> 01:13:38,892
Number one, toast.

2143
01:13:38,893 --> 01:13:40,402
- Toast?
- Toast?

2144
01:13:40,403 --> 01:13:42,102
Number two, battery.

2145
01:13:42,103 --> 01:13:43,302
(Battery)

2146
01:13:43,303 --> 01:13:45,102
Number three, forgetfulness.

2147
01:13:45,103 --> 01:13:46,232
(Forgetfulness)

2148
01:13:46,233 --> 01:13:48,143
Number four, keyboard.

2149
01:13:48,443 --> 01:13:49,543
Keyboard?

2150
01:13:49,573 --> 01:13:50,873
I mean...

2151
01:13:51,813 --> 01:13:53,112
Are we looking for the words that contain "Geon" for "Dried?"

2152
01:13:53,113 --> 01:13:54,212
Yes, we are.

2153
01:13:54,213 --> 01:13:56,213
We need to find all of the words that contain "Geon" for "Dried."

2154
01:13:56,283 --> 01:13:58,112
We have an advantage thanks to Tae Hyun.

2155
01:13:58,113 --> 01:13:59,383
He knows all the Chinese characters.

2156
01:13:59,913 --> 01:14:02,023
(I do?)

2157
01:14:02,153 --> 01:14:03,792
That's right. He used Chinese characters in the past.

2158
01:14:03,793 --> 01:14:05,822
Hangul was invented when you were 30, right?

2159
01:14:05,823 --> 01:14:07,322
When they make a 100,000-won bill,

2160
01:14:07,323 --> 01:14:08,922
- they'll put your face on it.
- Tell us.

2161
01:14:08,923 --> 01:14:10,093
You know,

2162
01:14:10,433 --> 01:14:11,733
I was a slave.

2163
01:14:12,593 --> 01:14:13,703
Didn't you know any Chinese characters?

2164
01:14:14,033 --> 01:14:15,763
Didn't you read books in secret?

2165
01:14:16,203 --> 01:14:17,432
When you look at the choices,

2166
01:14:17,433 --> 01:14:18,773
which one seems to be incorrect.

2167
01:14:18,803 --> 01:14:21,243
- It can't be "Toast." - It can't be "Toast," right?

2168
01:14:21,273 --> 01:14:23,243
I think the correct answers are "Battery" and Forgetfulness."

2169
01:14:23,273 --> 01:14:24,442
Why "Battery?"

2170
01:14:24,443 --> 01:14:25,542
(Battery, forgetfulness)

2171
01:14:25,543 --> 01:14:26,772
I think it means...

2172
01:14:26,773 --> 01:14:28,012
- "Dry electricity" in Korean.
- Dry electricity.

2173
01:14:28,013 --> 01:14:29,413
- Dry electricity.
- What?

2174
01:14:29,543 --> 01:14:31,413
- You're right.
- Dry electricity.

2175
01:14:31,483 --> 01:14:33,082
Let's make "Battery" a fixed answer.

2176
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:34,782
"Battery" and Forgetfulness."

2177
01:14:34,783 --> 01:14:36,892
It could mean that your memories dried out.

2178
01:14:36,893 --> 01:14:38,893
- I see.
- That could be the meaning.

2179
01:14:39,093 --> 01:14:40,263
Why would your memories dry out?

2180
01:14:40,793 --> 01:14:42,262
It might contain the Chinese character for "Memory."

2181
01:14:42,263 --> 01:14:44,793
Then it'd mean "Dried-out memory."

2182
01:14:45,663 --> 01:14:47,733
I think the correct answers are "Battery" and Forgetfulness."

2183
01:14:47,863 --> 01:14:49,462
But either "Toast" or "Keyboard..."

2184
01:14:49,463 --> 01:14:51,033
can be a trick.

2185
01:14:51,433 --> 01:14:52,803
It's so hard.

2186
01:14:52,873 --> 01:14:54,103
Toast.

2187
01:14:56,343 --> 01:14:58,973
I think "Toast" contains "Geon" for "Dried."

2188
01:14:59,043 --> 01:15:00,442
Perhaps it means, "Let's give a toast,"

2189
01:15:00,443 --> 01:15:02,183
"drink, and dry the glass."

2190
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:04,782
I think you're right.

2191
01:15:04,783 --> 01:15:06,613
- Shall we clink our glasses?
- Let's do that.

2192
01:15:07,553 --> 01:15:09,053
Do you think it's about emptying the glass?

2193
01:15:09,253 --> 01:15:10,653
Why would they use the character for "Dried?"

2194
01:15:11,093 --> 01:15:12,552
(Unsure)

2195
01:15:12,553 --> 01:15:13,793
Let's just answer incorrectly...

2196
01:15:14,223 --> 01:15:16,263
- and have an individual match.
- Let's have an individual match.

2197
01:15:16,423 --> 01:15:18,993
Tae Hyun, it might be "Forgetfulness."

2198
01:15:19,093 --> 01:15:21,202
The moisture in your brain...

2199
01:15:21,203 --> 01:15:22,232
- Your memories dry out.
- Your memories dry out.

2200
01:15:22,233 --> 01:15:24,072
- Your brain becomes dry.
- Your memories dry out.

2201
01:15:24,073 --> 01:15:25,573
That might be the meaning.

2202
01:15:25,903 --> 01:15:28,072
Okay. Shall we go with "Battery" and "Forgetfulness?"

2203
01:15:28,073 --> 01:15:29,502
- Shall we do that?
- Let's go.

2204
01:15:29,503 --> 01:15:30,872
- Okay.
- It's okay to get it wrong.

2205
01:15:30,873 --> 01:15:32,072
Then we'll have an individual match.

2206
01:15:32,073 --> 01:15:34,682
We'll give our answers. There are two choices.

2207
01:15:34,683 --> 01:15:36,953
"Battery" and "Forgetfulness."

2208
01:15:37,013 --> 01:15:38,983
I have no confidence whatsoever.

2209
01:15:39,253 --> 01:15:41,022
- We might be right.
- Battery.

2210
01:15:41,023 --> 01:15:42,123
"Battery" is...

2211
01:15:42,683 --> 01:15:43,723
correct.

2212
01:15:44,293 --> 01:15:45,923
It's correct. That one is correct.

2213
01:15:46,593 --> 01:15:48,222
We must've gotten it right. They look unhappy.

2214
01:15:48,223 --> 01:15:49,723
- No way.
- They look unhappy.

2215
01:15:49,863 --> 01:15:50,992
"Forgetfulness" is...

2216
01:15:50,993 --> 01:15:55,262
("Battery" is correct.)

2217
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,562
incorrect.

2218
01:15:56,563 --> 01:15:58,302
("Forgetfulness" is incorrect.)

2219
01:15:58,303 --> 01:15:59,473
What's the other one?

2220
01:15:59,533 --> 01:16:00,643
It's "Toast."

2221
01:16:00,743 --> 01:16:02,643
- Is it the meaning we guessed?
- "Toast?"

2222
01:16:02,703 --> 01:16:03,972
The characters for "Toast" mean...

2223
01:16:03,973 --> 01:16:05,073
"Glass" and "Dried."

2224
01:16:05,613 --> 01:16:06,712
We were right.

2225
01:16:06,713 --> 01:16:08,443
- What you said was correct.
- Then...

2226
01:16:08,813 --> 01:16:10,612
We were right.

2227
01:16:10,613 --> 01:16:11,952
(For "Forgetfulness," "Geon" means "Healthy.")

2228
01:16:11,953 --> 01:16:13,583
We were bound to have an individual match.

2229
01:16:13,723 --> 01:16:14,852
- Okay.
- Let's have an individual match.

2230
01:16:14,853 --> 01:16:16,383
Let's have an individual match. Let's make it quick.

2231
01:16:16,423 --> 01:16:17,592
I'll give you a question on a slogan.

2232
01:16:17,593 --> 01:16:18,892
- A slogan.
- Good.

2233
01:16:18,893 --> 01:16:21,893
There are three answers you need to give.

2234
01:16:22,823 --> 01:16:24,992
In the order you give an answer, you'll be exempt.

2235
01:16:24,993 --> 01:16:26,162
- Okay.
- All right.

2236
01:16:26,163 --> 01:16:28,203
We'll be done with a single question. Very nice.

2237
01:16:28,663 --> 01:16:30,132
It's a traffic safety slogan.

2238
01:16:30,133 --> 01:16:31,932
- Traffic safety.
- A traffic safety slogan.

2239
01:16:31,933 --> 01:16:36,803
The slogan consists of numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4.

2240
01:16:37,043 --> 01:16:39,072
From numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4,

2241
01:16:39,073 --> 01:16:41,482
number one is "Stop for now."

2242
01:16:41,483 --> 01:16:42,883
(Number 1 is "Stop for now.")

2243
01:16:43,013 --> 01:16:44,512
It's a bit like an acrostic poem.

2244
01:16:44,513 --> 01:16:46,213
I think I've seen it somewhere.

2245
01:16:46,313 --> 01:16:48,522
Answer what follows...

2246
01:16:48,523 --> 01:16:50,692
- numbers 2, 3, and 4.
- Numbers 2, 3, and 4.

2247
01:16:50,693 --> 01:16:51,823
It's about traffic safety.

2248
01:16:52,293 --> 01:16:53,963
Let me answer. Number two, look around.

2249
01:16:54,423 --> 01:16:56,293
- Incorrect.
- It was a nice approach.

2250
01:16:56,393 --> 01:16:58,493
What was that? "Number two, look around?"

2251
01:16:58,763 --> 01:17:00,802
"Look around" sounds similar to "Two" in Korean.

2252
01:17:00,803 --> 01:17:01,902
- I see.
- Two.

2253
01:17:01,903 --> 01:17:03,903
Gosh, you were overthinking.

2254
01:17:04,303 --> 01:17:06,373
You need to keep it simple.

2255
01:17:07,873 --> 01:17:09,173
- Number 4.
- Number 4.

2256
01:17:09,373 --> 01:17:10,813
Check for people.

2257
01:17:10,873 --> 01:17:12,213
Check for people.

2258
01:17:12,943 --> 01:17:14,012
- Incorrect.
- What?

2259
01:17:14,013 --> 01:17:15,482
I thought it was correct.

2260
01:17:15,483 --> 01:17:17,313
- I think it's about "People." - It's about "People."

2261
01:17:17,553 --> 01:17:19,412
Tae Hyun, go ahead and say something.

2262
01:17:19,413 --> 01:17:20,482
Say something. You too.

2263
01:17:20,483 --> 01:17:21,583
Watch out for an accident.

2264
01:17:21,723 --> 01:17:22,752
Incorrect.

2265
01:17:22,753 --> 01:17:24,593
- Take care of an accident.
- Incorrect.

2266
01:17:24,853 --> 01:17:26,593
It's hard. Hold on.

2267
01:17:27,523 --> 01:17:28,663
Let me answer.

2268
01:17:29,293 --> 01:17:30,992
Look left and right.

2269
01:17:30,993 --> 01:17:33,432
(Number 2, Look left and right.)

2270
01:17:33,433 --> 01:17:34,463
That's a good one.

2271
01:17:35,563 --> 01:17:36,703
- Correct.
- Yes!

2272
01:17:39,133 --> 01:17:40,233
That was incredible.

2273
01:17:40,503 --> 01:17:41,643
My goodness.

2274
01:17:41,773 --> 01:17:42,942
That was incredible.

2275
01:17:42,943 --> 01:17:44,242
(Proud)

2276
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:46,472
I thought number two would be the hardest.

2277
01:17:46,473 --> 01:17:47,582
Let me answer.

2278
01:17:47,583 --> 01:17:48,583
Let me answer.

2279
01:17:48,584 --> 01:17:49,942
- Number 3, go after 3 seconds.
- Incorrect.

2280
01:17:49,943 --> 01:17:51,782
- Go after a three-second halt.
- Incorrect.

2281
01:17:51,783 --> 01:17:53,082
Let me answer. Stop for three seconds.

2282
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:54,083
Incorrect.

2283
01:17:54,084 --> 01:17:55,353
Halt for three seconds.

2284
01:17:55,423 --> 01:17:57,123
- Incorrect.
- Let me answer.

2285
01:17:57,823 --> 01:17:58,923
For three seconds.

2286
01:17:59,793 --> 01:18:01,692
(Could that be correct?)

2287
01:18:01,693 --> 01:18:02,793
Correct.

2288
01:18:04,033 --> 01:18:05,332
(Dong Hyun escapes 1st after getting number 3 right!)

2289
01:18:05,333 --> 01:18:07,233
- "For 3 seconds?" - For 3 seconds.

2290
01:18:07,563 --> 01:18:08,802
I can't believe that those two remain.

2291
01:18:08,803 --> 01:18:09,902
It's a 1-on-1 match.

2292
01:18:09,903 --> 01:18:11,602
(Only two members remain.)

2293
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:13,073
It's a speed quiz.

2294
01:18:13,173 --> 01:18:14,772
It's like the final match of the Summer Games.

2295
01:18:14,773 --> 01:18:15,802
There's a 50-50 chance.

2296
01:18:15,803 --> 01:18:18,042
I really think that they have a 50-50 chance.

2297
01:18:18,043 --> 01:18:19,272
(The masters of Handsome Guys will go against each other.)

2298
01:18:19,273 --> 01:18:20,582
- "Beware of an accident?" - Prevent an accident.

2299
01:18:20,583 --> 01:18:21,583
(They give the final answer at the same time.)

2300
01:18:21,584 --> 01:18:24,682
(Beware of an accident versus Prevent an accident)

2301
01:18:24,683 --> 01:18:28,183
- "Prevent an accident" is correct.
- Has no one said it before?

2302
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:29,553
Has no one said it before?

2303
01:18:29,953 --> 01:18:32,323
(Tae Hyun is the last person to answer correctly.)

2304
01:18:32,723 --> 01:18:34,962
- Is it "Prevent?" - I had no idea.

2305
01:18:34,963 --> 01:18:36,722
- The meaning of the slogan is, - But this is...

2306
01:18:36,723 --> 01:18:39,363
"Stop for now and look left and right for three seconds..."

2307
01:18:39,763 --> 01:18:41,262
"in order to prevent an accident."

2308
01:18:41,263 --> 01:18:43,103
(Please drive safely at all times.)

2309
01:18:43,263 --> 01:18:44,402
Gosh, Woo Il.

2310
01:18:44,403 --> 01:18:45,632
- That's right.
- We expected him to pay.

2311
01:18:45,633 --> 01:18:47,843
- You're good at dodging.
- Seriously.

2312
01:18:49,173 --> 01:18:50,303
Shall we order another Coke?

2313
01:18:50,943 --> 01:18:52,712
- Go ahead.
- One Coke isn't expensive.

2314
01:18:52,713 --> 01:18:54,012
- I was so nervous.
- Here you go.

2315
01:18:54,013 --> 01:18:55,783
- Okay.
- I mean...

2316
01:18:56,083 --> 01:18:57,713
- I'll go and pay.
- Thank you for the food.

2317
01:18:58,453 --> 01:19:00,183
- Any time.
- My goodness.

2318
01:19:00,883 --> 01:19:02,453
- Did you enjoy the food?
- I really enjoyed it.

2319
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:04,322
You came inside and ate today.

2320
01:19:04,323 --> 01:19:06,222
- Yes. For the first time...
- Would you like the receipt?

2321
01:19:06,223 --> 01:19:07,493
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

2322
01:19:07,563 --> 01:19:09,162
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2323
01:19:09,163 --> 01:19:11,162
(Yi Kyung pays for DMR 1, dried fish.)

2324
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:13,032
I'm so happy that I got to eat there after years.

2325
01:19:13,033 --> 01:19:14,033
(Total: 200 dollars)

2326
01:19:14,034 --> 01:19:15,963
- Hello.
- Hello.

2327
01:19:16,003 --> 01:19:17,233
Where are we going next?

2328
01:19:17,673 --> 01:19:18,733
Is the restaurant nearby?

2329
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:20,032
Pork tripe?

2330
01:19:20,033 --> 01:19:22,643
- I'm following the smell of pork.
- Really?

2331
01:19:23,203 --> 01:19:25,412
This is the main road. We need to go into an alley.

2332
01:19:25,413 --> 01:19:26,573
- Do we need to go into an alley?
- Yes.

2333
01:19:27,113 --> 01:19:29,383
Look how hip these restaurants are. This place is hip.

2334
01:19:29,743 --> 01:19:31,512
There are many young people.

2335
01:19:31,513 --> 01:19:32,912
- You're right.
- This place is hip.

2336
01:19:32,913 --> 01:19:34,353
Where are young people?

2337
01:19:35,023 --> 01:19:36,183
This place is pretty hip.

2338
01:19:36,453 --> 01:19:39,492
- It's a hidden restaurant.
- It's pretty hip.

2339
01:19:39,493 --> 01:19:40,562
(Restaurants with a young vibe begin to appear.)

2340
01:19:40,563 --> 01:19:41,823
This place must have people in their 20s.

2341
01:19:41,963 --> 01:19:44,292
Thanks to Handsome Guys,

2342
01:19:44,293 --> 01:19:46,292
I'm visiting the nooks and crannies of Seoul for the first time.

2343
01:19:46,293 --> 01:19:48,763
- Same here.
- Seriously. I'm a country bumpkin.

2344
01:19:49,403 --> 01:19:50,632
- This must be the restaurant.
- This is it.

2345
01:19:50,633 --> 01:19:51,772
- What?
- Look.

2346
01:19:51,773 --> 01:19:53,203
- It's a cafe.
- It looks like a bakery.

2347
01:19:53,703 --> 01:19:55,202
- What?
- Pork tripe hot pot.

2348
01:19:55,203 --> 01:19:56,303
- Really?
- Yes.

2349
01:19:56,803 --> 01:19:58,412
- Pork tripe hot pot?
- It doesn't look like...

2350
01:19:58,413 --> 01:20:00,012
a restaurant that sells pork tripe hot pot.

2351
01:20:00,013 --> 01:20:02,613
- It looks like a dessert cafe.
- Yes, it looks like a cafe.

2352
01:20:04,083 --> 01:20:06,653
(The exterior is simple and clean.)

2353
01:20:07,053 --> 01:20:11,323
(The interior looks like a cafe where you want to drink coffee.)

2354
01:20:12,223 --> 01:20:16,223
(But it's a famous restaurant that serves pork tripe hot pot.)

2355
01:20:18,433 --> 01:20:20,132
(Taking photos)

2356
01:20:20,133 --> 01:20:23,033
There's no unpleasant smell. The taste is clean.

2357
01:20:23,163 --> 01:20:25,732
This dish is worth the wait.

2358
01:20:25,733 --> 01:20:27,642
The soup is rich and tasty.

2359
01:20:27,643 --> 01:20:28,772
(The rich soup is the best.)

2360
01:20:28,773 --> 01:20:30,242
The soup makes you reach for more.

2361
01:20:30,243 --> 01:20:32,413
The taste makes you crave a shot of soju.

2362
01:20:33,073 --> 01:20:36,813
(Today's dinner menu captivated the taste of the young customers.)

2363
01:20:38,213 --> 01:20:41,883
(DMR 2, Pork tripe hot pot)

2364
01:20:41,983 --> 01:20:43,853
- I've never imagined it.
- My goodness.

2365
01:20:44,193 --> 01:20:46,193
Look at the table! It's insane.

2366
01:20:46,753 --> 01:20:47,892
What's this?

2367
01:20:47,893 --> 01:20:50,763
Is this really a pork tripe restaurant?

2368
01:20:50,933 --> 01:20:52,663
It looks like a table you see at a Chinese restaurant.

2369
01:20:53,463 --> 01:20:55,133
- Look.
- How is it so nice inside?

2370
01:20:55,663 --> 01:20:56,902
I've never seen a pork tripe hot pot place...

2371
01:20:56,903 --> 01:20:58,133
with such an interior design.

2372
01:20:58,433 --> 01:21:01,142
Let's call the owner and have a talk.

2373
01:21:01,143 --> 01:21:02,572
- Sir.
- I want to ask about...

2374
01:21:02,573 --> 01:21:04,043
the interior design.

2375
01:21:04,273 --> 01:21:06,112
- Why did he make this decision?
- The owner is hip.

2376
01:21:06,113 --> 01:21:08,182
- He's hip.
- The owner is hip.

2377
01:21:08,183 --> 01:21:09,442
You're the owner's son, right?

2378
01:21:09,443 --> 01:21:11,253
- I'm the manager.
- The manager.

2379
01:21:11,313 --> 01:21:12,783
He's hip. Even his position is hip.

2380
01:21:12,883 --> 01:21:14,223
There's something we're the most curious about.

2381
01:21:14,523 --> 01:21:16,122
Is the interior design like this...

2382
01:21:16,123 --> 01:21:18,822
because you took over a cafe or a bakery?

2383
01:21:18,823 --> 01:21:20,792
Did you remodel the place after deciding to open...

2384
01:21:20,793 --> 01:21:21,963
a pork tripe restaurant?

2385
01:21:22,063 --> 01:21:24,532
Old-fashioned pork tripe places are common.

2386
01:21:24,533 --> 01:21:25,592
- That's right.
- Yes.

2387
01:21:25,593 --> 01:21:28,802
Many people think such places are unhygienic.

2388
01:21:28,803 --> 01:21:31,102
To break that prejudice,

2389
01:21:31,103 --> 01:21:32,103
- we went with this interior design.
- That's right.

2390
01:21:32,104 --> 01:21:34,003
- Did you choose it on purpose?
- Yes.

2391
01:21:34,303 --> 01:21:36,673
They have a different way of thinking.

2392
01:21:37,343 --> 01:21:41,043
Can you tell us why you chose to sell pork tripe?

2393
01:21:41,283 --> 01:21:44,482
Pork tripe is more difficult to handle than beef tripe.

2394
01:21:44,483 --> 01:21:45,512
Is it more difficult?

2395
01:21:45,513 --> 01:21:47,682
It is. Thus, it's harder to run a pork tripe restaurant.

2396
01:21:47,683 --> 01:21:49,822
We thought it'd give us a competitive edge,

2397
01:21:49,823 --> 01:21:50,852
so we chose pork tripe.

2398
01:21:50,853 --> 01:21:52,322
- You were confident.
- Yes.

2399
01:21:52,323 --> 01:21:54,422
You'll know once you eat it.

2400
01:21:54,423 --> 01:21:55,462
(Through taste, we'll show why we chose pork tripe.)

2401
01:21:55,463 --> 01:21:56,822
It'll be better than 100 words.

2402
01:21:56,823 --> 01:21:58,162
They compete with the taste.

2403
01:21:58,163 --> 01:21:59,262
I guess it tastes different.

2404
01:21:59,263 --> 01:22:01,532
The main menu is the pork tripe hot pot.

2405
01:22:01,533 --> 01:22:03,262
(Main menu: Pork tripe hot pot)

2406
01:22:03,263 --> 01:22:05,003
The side menus are potato jeon,

2407
01:22:05,103 --> 01:22:06,173
aged kimchi roll,

2408
01:22:07,033 --> 01:22:08,102
and fried rice.

2409
01:22:08,103 --> 01:22:09,303
(Side menu: Aged kimchi and tripe fried rice)

2410
01:22:09,403 --> 01:22:11,212
Shall we order everything?

2411
01:22:11,213 --> 01:22:13,043
Let's just order everything.

2412
01:22:13,473 --> 01:22:15,513
It doesn't matter if there are 3 or 2 people.

2413
01:22:15,843 --> 01:22:17,243
They order everything.

2414
01:22:18,383 --> 01:22:19,452
Okay.

2415
01:22:19,453 --> 01:22:20,823
I can't believe it. They ordered everything on the menu.

2416
01:22:21,753 --> 01:22:23,253
(Looking up the menu)

2417
01:22:23,953 --> 01:22:25,223
- It's unique.
- Does it look incredible?

2418
01:22:25,493 --> 01:22:27,193
It looks incredible from the photos.

2419
01:22:27,923 --> 01:22:29,862
I've never seen such a dish. It's so red.

2420
01:22:29,863 --> 01:22:31,333
Here comes the hot pot.

2421
01:22:31,563 --> 01:22:32,892
I'll put it in the middle.

2422
01:22:32,893 --> 01:22:34,333
(The main menu, hot pot appears.)

2423
01:22:34,603 --> 01:22:36,763
- It's what I saw in the photos.
- It's exactly like the photos.

2424
01:22:36,803 --> 01:22:37,933
Is this the small size?

2425
01:22:38,933 --> 01:22:40,133
It smells good.

2426
01:22:40,773 --> 01:22:43,403
(To the pork tripe that has turned white from repeated rinsing, )

2427
01:22:44,073 --> 01:22:46,173
(broth gets added.)

2428
01:22:47,513 --> 01:22:49,112
(Cabbage)

2429
01:22:49,113 --> 01:22:50,182
(Green onions)

2430
01:22:50,183 --> 01:22:52,053
(Glass noodles)

2431
01:22:52,183 --> 01:22:53,212
(A heap of chili peppers...)

2432
01:22:53,213 --> 01:22:54,683
(and perilla leaves)

2433
01:22:55,253 --> 01:22:57,693
(A big lump of minced garlic wraps up the dish.)

2434
01:22:59,453 --> 01:23:01,092
(Pork tripe hot pot with spicy and rich soup)

2435
01:23:01,093 --> 01:23:02,793
Please boil it for five minutes.

2436
01:23:03,823 --> 01:23:05,963
It looks completely different from beef tripe.

2437
01:23:06,233 --> 01:23:08,032
- It's rich. The soup is rich.
- Yes.

2438
01:23:08,033 --> 01:23:09,802
- It smells good.
- The dish contains...

2439
01:23:09,803 --> 01:23:11,873
so much pork tripe.

2440
01:23:12,003 --> 01:23:13,233
It looks so nice.

2441
01:23:13,433 --> 01:23:15,142
- Here it comes.
- I'll put it on the table.

2442
01:23:15,143 --> 01:23:16,243
Potato jeon.

2443
01:23:16,973 --> 01:23:18,242
It's thick.

2444
01:23:18,243 --> 01:23:19,472
It looks so pretty.

2445
01:23:19,473 --> 01:23:21,243
(The shape is round.)

2446
01:23:22,113 --> 01:23:23,682
(It takes 20 to 30 minutes to make the dish.)

2447
01:23:23,683 --> 01:23:26,013
(Julienned potato gets fried until it turns crispy.)

2448
01:23:26,853 --> 01:23:29,753
(The dish that's crispy outside and moist inside, potato jeon)

2449
01:23:30,823 --> 01:23:31,993
- Cheers.
- I love it so much.

2450
01:23:32,293 --> 01:23:34,123
- It's thick. It's like a pancake.
- Look at this.

2451
01:23:34,893 --> 01:23:35,992
(It's full of potatoes.)

2452
01:23:35,993 --> 01:23:37,123
How is it so thick?

2453
01:23:39,993 --> 01:23:42,903
(Dip it in the chili mayonnaise sauce!)

2454
01:23:45,003 --> 01:23:46,473
(It's crispy!)

2455
01:23:48,573 --> 01:23:50,102
How is the potato jeon?

2456
01:23:50,103 --> 01:23:52,213
- It contains crushed potato.
- Yes.

2457
01:23:52,343 --> 01:23:53,912
The potato is getting squeezed out.

2458
01:23:53,913 --> 01:23:55,112
(My goodness)

2459
01:23:55,113 --> 01:23:56,443
The seasoning is perfect.

2460
01:23:57,143 --> 01:24:00,083
It's so chewy.

2461
01:24:00,553 --> 01:24:03,023
- Is it chewy?
- The chewiness of potatoes?

2462
01:24:03,223 --> 01:24:04,723
It has the potato starch.

2463
01:24:05,793 --> 01:24:08,123
The potato jeon is chewy.

2464
01:24:10,693 --> 01:24:11,693
What's this?

2465
01:24:12,493 --> 01:24:14,262
You can eat the hot pot right away,

2466
01:24:14,263 --> 01:24:15,632
but please stir it first.

2467
01:24:15,633 --> 01:24:16,663
- Okay.
- Okay.

2468
01:24:16,763 --> 01:24:17,772
Try it.

2469
01:24:17,773 --> 01:24:20,073
(It became more appetizing after 5 minutes of boiling.)

2470
01:24:24,073 --> 01:24:25,173
It's tasty now.

2471
01:24:26,013 --> 01:24:27,813
Gosh, it smells so good.

2472
01:24:28,713 --> 01:24:30,042
The backside is tasty.

2473
01:24:30,043 --> 01:24:32,153
You should eat it one at a time.

2474
01:24:32,413 --> 01:24:33,613
- Yes.
- The last one...

2475
01:24:36,853 --> 01:24:38,093
(Impressed)

2476
01:24:39,053 --> 01:24:40,152
It's so tasty.

2477
01:24:40,153 --> 01:24:41,723
(Impressed)

2478
01:24:42,023 --> 01:24:43,092
A bit more.

2479
01:24:43,093 --> 01:24:44,233
(They look at each other and marvel at the taste.)

2480
01:24:44,263 --> 01:24:45,263
It's the best.

2481
01:24:47,093 --> 01:24:50,203
(They slurp the glass noodles that soaked up the seasoning.)

2482
01:24:50,803 --> 01:24:52,103
Take some glass noodles.

2483
01:24:53,533 --> 01:24:54,902
- This is incredible.
- It's insane.

2484
01:24:54,903 --> 01:24:57,613
I personally think it's better than beef tripe. Seriously.

2485
01:24:58,173 --> 01:25:00,742
It's the taste I expected and wanted.

2486
01:25:00,743 --> 01:25:02,283
But it's an upgraded version.

2487
01:25:02,613 --> 01:25:04,482
- It looks very spicy, right?
- Yes.

2488
01:25:04,483 --> 01:25:06,012
It isn't that spicy.

2489
01:25:06,013 --> 01:25:07,013
(The taste is simple and clean, not spicy.)

2490
01:25:07,014 --> 01:25:09,682
- I love the texture.
- It isn't that spicy.

2491
01:25:09,683 --> 01:25:11,722
- You know, - Yes?

2492
01:25:11,723 --> 01:25:14,292
Pork can have an unpleasant smell. Does it have that smell?

2493
01:25:14,293 --> 01:25:16,792
It suits the interior design and concept of the restaurant.

2494
01:25:16,793 --> 01:25:18,462
- There's no unpleasant smell.
- None whatsoever?

2495
01:25:18,463 --> 01:25:19,463
- I see.
- The taste is clean.

2496
01:25:19,464 --> 01:25:20,902
That way, everyone will like the dish.

2497
01:25:20,903 --> 01:25:22,202
Then there are perilla leaves.

2498
01:25:22,203 --> 01:25:23,203
(The perilla leaves are important.)

2499
01:25:23,204 --> 01:25:24,332
- Did you taste them?
- Yes.

2500
01:25:24,333 --> 01:25:25,702
There were a lot of perilla leaves, right?

2501
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:26,872
That was a lot.

2502
01:25:26,873 --> 01:25:28,843
They're so tasty. They provide a kick.

2503
01:25:29,503 --> 01:25:30,542
A kick.

2504
01:25:30,543 --> 01:25:31,612
(The aroma of perilla leaves eliminates the unpleasant odor, )

2505
01:25:31,613 --> 01:25:32,673
(so you can enjoy the pork tripe hot pot.)

2506
01:25:34,343 --> 01:25:36,342
(Sang Uk inhales the food with perilla leaves.)

2507
01:25:36,343 --> 01:25:38,482
- I'm curious about the potato jeon.
- Right?

2508
01:25:38,483 --> 01:25:40,312
Yes. It looks so tasty.

2509
01:25:40,313 --> 01:25:41,622
- It's bound to be tasty.
- Gosh, it's...

2510
01:25:41,623 --> 01:25:43,922
Eighty teams were waiting. It means everyone likes it.

2511
01:25:43,923 --> 01:25:44,992
It makes no sense.

2512
01:25:44,993 --> 01:25:46,152
Everyone can eat it.

2513
01:25:46,153 --> 01:25:47,392
It's bound to be tasty.

2514
01:25:47,393 --> 01:25:49,792
Eighty teams were waiting. It means everyone likes it.

2515
01:25:49,793 --> 01:25:50,822
It makes no sense.

2516
01:25:50,823 --> 01:25:52,163
Everyone can eat it.

2517
01:25:52,733 --> 01:25:54,732
Sang Uk, if it's okay with you,

2518
01:25:54,733 --> 01:25:57,062
I want one of them to taste the potato jeon...

2519
01:25:57,063 --> 01:25:58,132
while it's warm.

2520
01:25:58,133 --> 01:25:59,632
- That's right.
- Seriously.

2521
01:25:59,633 --> 01:26:01,502
It'll be great if they can eat it while it's warm.

2522
01:26:01,503 --> 01:26:04,412
Let's play a speedy and fun game that'll end quickly.

2523
01:26:04,413 --> 01:26:06,512
- It's the Single Syllable 369.
- Eat it while it's warm.

2524
01:26:06,513 --> 01:26:08,042
- What?
- Single Syllable 369?

2525
01:26:08,043 --> 01:26:09,982
- Single Syllable 369.
- This is how it goes.

2526
01:26:09,983 --> 01:26:11,182
Let's say the four of you are playing.

2527
01:26:11,183 --> 01:26:13,112
Three, six, nine

2528
01:26:13,113 --> 01:26:15,522
O, ne, two, three, four,

2529
01:26:15,523 --> 01:26:18,492
fi, ve, s, ix, se, ven,

2530
01:26:18,493 --> 01:26:19,993
ei, ght, ni, ne.

2531
01:26:20,123 --> 01:26:21,563
- It's hip.
- It's hip.

2532
01:26:22,193 --> 01:26:23,693
- It's an old game.
- It's hip.

2533
01:26:24,393 --> 01:26:26,693
- It's hip.
- This game is 20 years old.

2534
01:26:26,863 --> 01:26:28,233
When do we clap?

2535
01:26:28,503 --> 01:26:30,203
- Let's hurry up and begin.
- Okay.

2536
01:26:30,533 --> 01:26:32,702
- Three, six, nine - Tell me when we clap.

2537
01:26:32,703 --> 01:26:34,902
- Tell me when we clap.
- Three, six, nine

2538
01:26:34,903 --> 01:26:35,903
- O.
- Ne.

2539
01:26:35,903 --> 01:26:36,903
Two.

2540
01:26:37,303 --> 01:26:38,542
Three.

2541
01:26:38,543 --> 01:26:40,142
(Had it been three, he should've clapped instead.)

2542
01:26:40,143 --> 01:26:42,512
- Three, six, nine - Three, six, nine

2543
01:26:42,513 --> 01:26:43,612
- O.
- Ne.

2544
01:26:43,613 --> 01:26:44,713
Two.

2545
01:26:44,953 --> 01:26:45,982
- Four.
- Fi.

2546
01:26:45,983 --> 01:26:46,983
Ve.

2547
01:26:46,983 --> 01:26:47,983
(S, ix)

2548
01:26:47,984 --> 01:26:49,052
- Se.
- Ven.

2549
01:26:49,053 --> 01:26:50,123
- Ei.
- Ght.

2550
01:26:51,053 --> 01:26:52,723
- Ten.
- E.

2551
01:26:52,953 --> 01:26:54,193
- Le.
- Ven.

2552
01:26:54,563 --> 01:26:55,693
- Twel.
- Ve.

2553
01:26:55,993 --> 01:26:57,492
(Thir)

2554
01:26:57,493 --> 01:26:58,593
Teen.

2555
01:26:59,033 --> 01:27:03,062
- Tae Hyun is out.
- Hold on. This is... What's this?

2556
01:27:03,063 --> 01:27:04,402
Teach me the rules.

2557
01:27:04,403 --> 01:27:05,902
- Three, six, nine - Three, six, nine

2558
01:27:05,903 --> 01:27:07,502
- O. Two.
- Ne.

2559
01:27:07,503 --> 01:27:08,503
- Four.
- Fi.

2560
01:27:08,503 --> 01:27:09,503
Ve.

2561
01:27:09,743 --> 01:27:11,042
- Se.
- Ven.

2562
01:27:11,043 --> 01:27:12,173
- Ei.
- Ght.

2563
01:27:12,913 --> 01:27:14,513
- Ne.
- Okay.

2564
01:27:15,583 --> 01:27:17,882
- Why? I said, "Ne." - You clap for "Nine."

2565
01:27:17,883 --> 01:27:19,212
- Nine.
- That's right!

2566
01:27:19,213 --> 01:27:20,252
(What was wrong? Who won?)

2567
01:27:20,253 --> 01:27:21,522
Give me the plate.

2568
01:27:21,523 --> 01:27:22,723
(He doesn't understand the game.)

2569
01:27:22,783 --> 01:27:24,322
I don't know the rules,

2570
01:27:24,323 --> 01:27:25,853
so I can't laugh with you guys.

2571
01:27:26,723 --> 01:27:28,122
- I mean...
- Yi Kyung.

2572
01:27:28,123 --> 01:27:30,222
- I don't know the rules. When...
- Hey, let's...

2573
01:27:30,223 --> 01:27:32,232
I want to laugh with you guys. I don't even need to eat.

2574
01:27:32,233 --> 01:27:33,332
Hey,

2575
01:27:33,333 --> 01:27:36,233
let's keep playing this game until Woo Il learns the rules.

2576
01:27:37,733 --> 01:27:39,333
When do you clap?

2577
01:27:39,773 --> 01:27:40,773
I mean...

2578
01:27:40,774 --> 01:27:41,842
(Yi Kyung ignores the commotion and eats the potato jeon.)

2579
01:27:41,843 --> 01:27:44,513
- Earlier...
- Yi Kyung, how is it?

2580
01:27:46,643 --> 01:27:48,482
The inside is like the potato cream.

2581
01:27:48,483 --> 01:27:49,942
- Really?
- Sang Uk.

2582
01:27:49,943 --> 01:27:51,852
- There's potato cream inside.
- Five pieces remain, right?

2583
01:27:51,853 --> 01:27:53,212
Let's eat two pieces each.

2584
01:27:53,213 --> 01:27:54,252
- Since there are three...
- Okay.

2585
01:27:54,253 --> 01:27:55,722
- Do you understand?
- Three, six, nine

2586
01:27:55,723 --> 01:27:56,723
- Three, six, nine - Three, six, nine

2587
01:27:56,723 --> 01:27:57,723
Hold on. Start over.

2588
01:27:57,724 --> 01:27:59,053
- Who should go first?
- Three, six, nine

2589
01:27:59,153 --> 01:28:00,993
- O.
- Ne.

2590
01:28:01,163 --> 01:28:02,163
Two.

2591
01:28:02,493 --> 01:28:03,493
Four.

2592
01:28:03,494 --> 01:28:04,562
- Fi.
- Ve.

2593
01:28:04,563 --> 01:28:05,563
(S, ix)

2594
01:28:05,563 --> 01:28:06,563
- Se.
- Ven.

2595
01:28:06,564 --> 01:28:07,763
- Ei.
- Ght.

2596
01:28:07,903 --> 01:28:09,232
(Ni, ne)

2597
01:28:09,233 --> 01:28:10,233
Ten.

2598
01:28:10,234 --> 01:28:11,603
- E.
- Le.

2599
01:28:12,003 --> 01:28:13,003
Ven.

2600
01:28:13,233 --> 01:28:14,343
- Twel.
- Ve.

2601
01:28:15,373 --> 01:28:16,603
Three.

2602
01:28:17,373 --> 01:28:20,413
(He should've clapped.)

2603
01:28:20,743 --> 01:28:23,083
(Woo Il can't laugh again.)

2604
01:28:23,443 --> 01:28:24,753
This game is hard.

2605
01:28:25,153 --> 01:28:27,583
- It gets confusing.
- To be honest,

2606
01:28:28,023 --> 01:28:31,023
I clapped without knowing what was happening.

2607
01:28:31,393 --> 01:28:33,753
I read the room and felt like I should clap.

2608
01:28:34,323 --> 01:28:36,022
But it was correct.

2609
01:28:36,023 --> 01:28:37,023
- O.
- Ne.

2610
01:28:37,024 --> 01:28:38,062
(He read the room...)

2611
01:28:38,063 --> 01:28:39,262
(and clapped.)

2612
01:28:39,263 --> 01:28:40,293
(Was it correct?)

2613
01:28:40,733 --> 01:28:43,203
I was like, "I survived this turn."

2614
01:28:44,003 --> 01:28:45,102
- Three, six, nine - Three, six, nine

2615
01:28:45,103 --> 01:28:46,132
(The last round, Tae Hyun versus Dong Hyun)

2616
01:28:46,133 --> 01:28:47,133
- O.
- Ne.

2617
01:28:47,134 --> 01:28:48,142
- Se.
- Ven.

2618
01:28:48,143 --> 01:28:49,143
- Ei.
- Ght.

2619
01:28:50,373 --> 01:28:51,373
- Fi.
- F.

2620
01:28:51,374 --> 01:28:52,413
Teen.

2621
01:28:52,473 --> 01:28:53,473
S...

2622
01:28:54,043 --> 01:28:55,043
Hey.

2623
01:28:55,113 --> 01:28:56,983
Hey, isn't it incorrect?

2624
01:28:57,413 --> 01:28:58,413
Tae Hyun.

2625
01:28:58,414 --> 01:29:00,012
- Tae Hyun, come on over.
- That was incredible.

2626
01:29:00,013 --> 01:29:02,052
Why? Wasn't it correct?

2627
01:29:02,053 --> 01:29:03,083
I mean...

2628
01:29:03,553 --> 01:29:05,553
It's incredible that you guys went that far.

2629
01:29:06,253 --> 01:29:07,253
(Why did I do that?)

2630
01:29:07,254 --> 01:29:08,693
It's incredible that you guys went that far.

2631
01:29:08,923 --> 01:29:10,123
Tae Hyun, try it.

2632
01:29:10,823 --> 01:29:13,293
It's like a hotel in the potato jeon scene.

2633
01:29:13,663 --> 01:29:15,433
It's like a hash brown.

2634
01:29:17,463 --> 01:29:19,933
It's good, right? The inside has potato cream.

2635
01:29:20,833 --> 01:29:22,643
You can dip it in the sauce or put some sauce on the top.

2636
01:29:22,703 --> 01:29:24,273
Here's the aged kimchi roll.

2637
01:29:24,443 --> 01:29:25,743
Aged kimchi roll? What's that?

2638
01:29:26,673 --> 01:29:28,413
So that's the dish. It's like gimbap.

2639
01:29:28,543 --> 01:29:30,643
I was craving for rice.

2640
01:29:31,713 --> 01:29:34,953
(Rice gets rolled in aged kimchi instead of dried laver.)

2641
01:29:38,593 --> 01:29:40,853
(Then it gets sliced into bite-sized pieces.)

2642
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:42,922
(Sesame seeds get sprinkled on the top.)

2643
01:29:42,923 --> 01:29:47,193
It looks a bit like fried tofu stuffed with rice.

2644
01:29:47,493 --> 01:29:49,132
- Aged kimchi roll.
- Aged kimchi roll.

2645
01:29:49,133 --> 01:29:51,103
- Aged kimchi roll.
- What's inside?

2646
01:29:51,403 --> 01:29:53,572
- It's like a rice ball.
- Fried tofu stuffed with rice.

2647
01:29:53,573 --> 01:29:54,573
- It's plain rice.
- I think...

2648
01:29:54,574 --> 01:29:56,073
it'll be nice to dip it in the soup.

2649
01:29:57,143 --> 01:29:58,813
You should eat it with something.

2650
01:29:59,173 --> 01:30:00,512
Eat a piece as it is.

2651
01:30:00,513 --> 01:30:01,642
(He puts the entire piece in his mouth!)

2652
01:30:01,643 --> 01:30:02,813
- What?
- How does it taste?

2653
01:30:04,013 --> 01:30:05,583
Eat a piece as it is.

2654
01:30:06,513 --> 01:30:07,783
- What?
- How does it taste?

2655
01:30:09,083 --> 01:30:10,183
How is it?

2656
01:30:10,283 --> 01:30:12,393
- It's so nutty.
- It's very nutty.

2657
01:30:12,953 --> 01:30:14,522
- Let me explain.
- How is it nutty?

2658
01:30:14,523 --> 01:30:15,562
- You can only see...
- Isn't it sour?

2659
01:30:15,563 --> 01:30:17,563
The sesame seeds on the top, right?

2660
01:30:17,693 --> 01:30:19,593
But there are sesame seeds on the inside.

2661
01:30:19,993 --> 01:30:21,262
(Nutty sesame seeds are inside the rice as well.)

2662
01:30:21,263 --> 01:30:22,463
That's why it's nutty.

2663
01:30:22,763 --> 01:30:24,472
Aged kimchi isn't nutty.

2664
01:30:24,473 --> 01:30:26,102
- It's so nutty.
- Doesn't it taste sour?

2665
01:30:26,103 --> 01:30:28,473
It isn't salty at all.

2666
01:30:28,643 --> 01:30:29,742
Do you think it'll be tastier with the soup?

2667
01:30:29,743 --> 01:30:32,043
It'll be much tastier if we dip it in the soup.

2668
01:30:32,913 --> 01:30:34,043
- A perilla leaf.
- That's it.

2669
01:30:34,273 --> 01:30:35,443
Add a perilla leaf.

2670
01:30:35,743 --> 01:30:37,112
- Gosh.
- That's it.

2671
01:30:37,113 --> 01:30:38,253
That's a lot.

2672
01:30:39,883 --> 01:30:40,883
It looks tasty.

2673
01:30:41,153 --> 01:30:42,483
How tall will he make it?

2674
01:30:46,793 --> 01:30:47,823
My goodness.

2675
01:30:48,763 --> 01:30:50,293
(Clapping)

2676
01:30:52,263 --> 01:30:54,133
It's so tasty when it's soaked in the soup.

2677
01:30:55,303 --> 01:30:57,602
(He eats it again because it's so tasty.)

2678
01:30:57,603 --> 01:31:00,403
As you know, tripe is chewy.

2679
01:31:00,933 --> 01:31:02,743
- The soup is so nice.
- Did you try the soup?

2680
01:31:03,073 --> 01:31:04,103
The soup is so nice.

2681
01:31:06,013 --> 01:31:08,113
Only Woo Il hasn't had a taste, right?

2682
01:31:08,543 --> 01:31:10,012
Shall we play the 369 Game?

2683
01:31:10,013 --> 01:31:11,082
We'll do anything you want.

2684
01:31:11,083 --> 01:31:13,452
- Shall we play Silent 007 Bang?
- We'll do anything you want.

2685
01:31:13,453 --> 01:31:15,122
Just don't make us play the 369 Game.

2686
01:31:15,123 --> 01:31:17,482
Just don't make us play the Single Syllable 369 Game.

2687
01:31:17,483 --> 01:31:18,792
The Single Syllable 369 Game.

2688
01:31:18,793 --> 01:31:19,953
Do the Times Tables Game.

2689
01:31:20,193 --> 01:31:22,192
We'll give one ladleful to the winner.

2690
01:31:22,193 --> 01:31:23,362
(One ladleful of the hot pot)

2691
01:31:23,363 --> 01:31:24,423
- One ladleful.
- No way.

2692
01:31:24,633 --> 01:31:25,832
We'll add one aged kimchi roll.

2693
01:31:25,833 --> 01:31:27,193
- They should be eaten together.
- Aged kimchi roll.

2694
01:31:27,863 --> 01:31:29,163
- Really?
- Shall we begin?

2695
01:31:30,203 --> 01:31:32,002
(Getting ready to play the game)

2696
01:31:32,003 --> 01:31:33,073
But...

2697
01:31:33,603 --> 01:31:34,942
(The racehorses are waiting for the signal.)

2698
01:31:34,943 --> 01:31:36,343
- Let's go.
- Shall we begin?

2699
01:31:38,413 --> 01:31:40,642
- They're like racehorses.
- One spoonful.

2700
01:31:40,643 --> 01:31:42,212
- Memorize your times tables?
- The 369 Game was fun.

2701
01:31:42,213 --> 01:31:44,613
- Memorize your times tables - Memorize your times tables

2702
01:31:44,713 --> 01:31:46,212
- Eight times six?
- Forty-eight.

2703
01:31:46,213 --> 01:31:47,382
- Memorize your times tables - Go faster.

2704
01:31:47,383 --> 01:31:48,852
- Seven times five?
- Thirty-five.

2705
01:31:48,853 --> 01:31:50,022
- Memorize your times tables - Memorize your times tables

2706
01:31:50,023 --> 01:31:51,322
- Seven times six?
- Thirty-two.

2707
01:31:51,323 --> 01:31:52,522
- Memorize... What is it?
- Okay.

2708
01:31:52,523 --> 01:31:53,652
Okay. Incorrect.

2709
01:31:53,653 --> 01:31:55,592
- Memorize your times tables - One member is out.

2710
01:31:55,593 --> 01:31:57,023
Let's switch to addition.

2711
01:31:57,163 --> 01:31:58,192
Three plus three is six.

2712
01:31:58,193 --> 01:31:59,893
Don't we need to change the chant then?

2713
01:31:59,993 --> 01:32:02,333
- Memorize your times tables - Memorize your times tables

2714
01:32:02,503 --> 01:32:04,503
- Nine plus three?
- Fifteen.

2715
01:32:06,773 --> 01:32:08,142
(Humiliated)

2716
01:32:08,143 --> 01:32:10,443
He neither multiplied them nor added them.

2717
01:32:11,043 --> 01:32:12,073
What was that?

2718
01:32:13,473 --> 01:32:14,512
That was insane.

2719
01:32:14,513 --> 01:32:16,182
(This time, they play the Single Syllable 369 Game!)

2720
01:32:16,183 --> 01:32:17,183
- O.
- Ne.

2721
01:32:17,183 --> 01:32:18,183
Two.

2722
01:32:18,183 --> 01:32:19,183
- Four.
- Fi.

2723
01:32:19,183 --> 01:32:20,183
- Ve.
- S...

2724
01:32:21,083 --> 01:32:22,623
(Tae Hyun is out!)

2725
01:32:24,023 --> 01:32:25,553
It's over when you put your guard down.

2726
01:32:25,823 --> 01:32:26,823
That was incredible.

2727
01:32:26,824 --> 01:32:29,363
We played three games so quickly.

2728
01:32:30,363 --> 01:32:32,432
This is perfect. The presentation is so pretty.

2729
01:32:32,433 --> 01:32:34,563
- You can eat it as it is.
- Yes, I love it.

2730
01:32:35,133 --> 01:32:36,133
The seasoning...

2731
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:37,133
(He lifts it up carefully.)

2732
01:32:38,203 --> 01:32:39,302
It's nutty.

2733
01:32:39,303 --> 01:32:41,172
It looks so nice.

2734
01:32:41,173 --> 01:32:42,942
Dong Hyun, give me the plate.

2735
01:32:42,943 --> 01:32:44,973
I'll give you some soup to taste.

2736
01:32:45,543 --> 01:32:46,673
Try the soup.

2737
01:32:49,383 --> 01:32:52,112
The soup tastes like rich kimchi stew.

2738
01:32:52,113 --> 01:32:54,453
How is the aged kimchi roll?

2739
01:32:54,583 --> 01:32:56,483
It must be because of aged kimchi.

2740
01:32:56,853 --> 01:32:58,023
It tastes like kimchi stew.

2741
01:32:58,693 --> 01:33:00,222
Doesn't it taste sour?

2742
01:33:00,223 --> 01:33:02,062
I thought the soup tasted like kimchi stew.

2743
01:33:02,063 --> 01:33:03,562
- It was because of the aged kimchi.
- Aged kimchi roll.

2744
01:33:03,563 --> 01:33:05,162
- I see.
- It gave the taste of kimchi stew.

2745
01:33:05,163 --> 01:33:06,662
- Yes.
- I know what you mean.

2746
01:33:06,663 --> 01:33:08,832
I'll order one to go.

2747
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,163
(He decides to order one to go!)

2748
01:33:10,263 --> 01:33:12,103
Shall we play a game for all the orders to go?

2749
01:33:12,533 --> 01:33:15,103
Who will order one to go?

2750
01:33:15,243 --> 01:33:16,272
All of us.

2751
01:33:16,273 --> 01:33:17,543
(Everyone decides to order one to go!)

2752
01:33:18,043 --> 01:33:20,273
How about this then?

2753
01:33:20,613 --> 01:33:22,042
Why don't the 6 of us play the Single Syllable 369 Game...

2754
01:33:22,043 --> 01:33:23,082
for the orders to go?

2755
01:33:23,083 --> 01:33:24,443
(The Single Syllable 369 Game for 6 people?)

2756
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:27,553
(He's strongly against it.)

2757
01:33:27,653 --> 01:33:29,723
- Just avoid placing last.
- No, I boycott it.

2758
01:33:29,983 --> 01:33:31,552
- Just avoid placing last.
- You know,

2759
01:33:31,553 --> 01:33:33,022
I don't understand the mechanism.

2760
01:33:33,023 --> 01:33:34,592
(I don't understand the mechanism of the Single Syllable 369 Game.)

2761
01:33:34,593 --> 01:33:37,062
I just played the game in a confused state.

2762
01:33:37,063 --> 01:33:39,733
If I get lucky, you'll place last.

2763
01:33:40,293 --> 01:33:41,702
- If I get lucky, you'll place last.
- Suddenly... Yes.

2764
01:33:41,703 --> 01:33:43,763
- If I get lucky, you'll place last.
- If I clap at the right time,

2765
01:33:43,933 --> 01:33:45,002
you'll place last.

2766
01:33:45,003 --> 01:33:46,672
- You'll order one to go.
- Have a quiz for what you ate.

2767
01:33:46,673 --> 01:33:47,932
- Okay.
- Then...

2768
01:33:47,933 --> 01:33:49,902
we'll play a game to decide who pays for the orders to go.

2769
01:33:49,903 --> 01:33:51,002
- Okay.
- Good.

2770
01:33:51,003 --> 01:33:52,112
It's 77 dollars.

2771
01:33:52,113 --> 01:33:53,812
- Is it 77 dollars?
- It's 77 dollars.

2772
01:33:53,813 --> 01:33:55,183
- Give us the quiz right away.
- Okay.

2773
01:33:55,243 --> 01:33:56,382
We'll show you a picture.

2774
01:33:56,383 --> 01:33:57,643
- A drawing quiz?
- What's this?

2775
01:33:57,883 --> 01:34:02,283
This drawing shows a mother pig nursing its piglets.

2776
01:34:02,953 --> 01:34:04,552
Such drawings were made...

2777
01:34:04,553 --> 01:34:08,563
between the 1950s and 1980s not for artistic values,

2778
01:34:09,093 --> 01:34:11,762
but for mass sales.

2779
01:34:11,763 --> 01:34:12,793
"Mass sales?"

2780
01:34:13,333 --> 01:34:16,933
Back then, such drawings decorated a certain place.

2781
01:34:17,263 --> 01:34:19,373
Thus, it was called "Blank" drawing.

2782
01:34:19,803 --> 01:34:21,032
What goes in the blank?

2783
01:34:21,033 --> 01:34:22,172
- It's hard.
- "Blank" drawing.

2784
01:34:22,173 --> 01:34:23,272
It's hard.

2785
01:34:23,273 --> 01:34:26,012
The drawing was hung in a certain place for decoration.

2786
01:34:26,013 --> 01:34:27,172
Not that drawing in particular.

2787
01:34:27,173 --> 01:34:29,942
We're talking about the landscape drawings...

2788
01:34:29,943 --> 01:34:31,382
with the folksy vibes.

2789
01:34:31,383 --> 01:34:33,553
- Sunflowers.
- Yes, something like that.

2790
01:34:33,683 --> 01:34:35,352
Drawings of windmills.

2791
01:34:35,353 --> 01:34:36,382
"Blank" drawing.

2792
01:34:36,383 --> 01:34:37,752
(Named after the location, it was called "Blank" drawing.)

2793
01:34:37,753 --> 01:34:38,823
"Blank" drawing.

2794
01:34:39,793 --> 01:34:40,853
The doorway?

2795
01:34:41,423 --> 01:34:43,123
The doorway? The doorway drawing?

2796
01:34:43,663 --> 01:34:46,393
No. He mentioned mass sales. It should be a common place.

2797
01:34:46,633 --> 01:34:50,732
Which place was common from the 1950s and 1980s...

2798
01:34:50,733 --> 01:34:51,902
if we exclude the house?

2799
01:34:51,903 --> 01:34:53,872
- Me.
- Is it a restaurant?

2800
01:34:53,873 --> 01:34:54,943
I think...

2801
01:34:55,073 --> 01:34:56,503
Do you think it's a restaurant? Let's give it a go.

2802
01:34:56,703 --> 01:34:57,903
It can't be a restaurant. There's no way.

2803
01:34:58,613 --> 01:35:00,143
No? Let me answer.

2804
01:35:00,973 --> 01:35:02,013
Restaurant.

2805
01:35:02,813 --> 01:35:04,512
As soon as you said that, he gave it as their answer.

2806
01:35:04,513 --> 01:35:05,912
- It's...
- Dong Hyun thinks it's incorrect.

2807
01:35:05,913 --> 01:35:07,553
- It's the most plausible.
- Yes.

2808
01:35:08,383 --> 01:35:09,383
Restaurant.

2809
01:35:09,384 --> 01:35:10,452
- I think it's correct.
- After all,

2810
01:35:10,453 --> 01:35:12,522
no other places were as common.

2811
01:35:12,523 --> 01:35:15,292
(Answer: Restaurant drawing)

2812
01:35:15,293 --> 01:35:16,322
It's correct.

2813
01:35:16,323 --> 01:35:17,662
(Answer: Restaurant drawing)

2814
01:35:17,663 --> 01:35:18,693
Incorrect.

2815
01:35:18,933 --> 01:35:20,533
I told you so. It can't be right.

2816
01:35:20,733 --> 01:35:21,903
Shall we guess now?

2817
01:35:22,233 --> 01:35:23,332
- An individual match?
- It can't be right.

2818
01:35:23,333 --> 01:35:24,933
- An individual match.
- Are we answering this question?

2819
01:35:25,073 --> 01:35:26,073
Restroom.

2820
01:35:26,074 --> 01:35:27,402
(Answer: Restroom drawing)

2821
01:35:27,403 --> 01:35:28,403
Incorrect.

2822
01:35:28,404 --> 01:35:29,543
Let me answer. Toilet?

2823
01:35:30,043 --> 01:35:31,613
- Toilet.
- It's the same as "Restroom."

2824
01:35:31,973 --> 01:35:34,912
Back then, "toilet" was used more commonly.

2825
01:35:34,913 --> 01:35:37,043
- Incorrect.
- Would you give us a hint?

2826
01:35:37,113 --> 01:35:39,053
Here's a hint. Most of the customers...

2827
01:35:39,353 --> 01:35:41,052
- were men.
- What? I was right.

2828
01:35:41,053 --> 01:35:43,253
- That's it.
- Seriously.

2829
01:35:43,553 --> 01:35:44,623
Let me answer.

2830
01:35:45,523 --> 01:35:47,252
- Barbershop?
- Barbershop?

2831
01:35:47,253 --> 01:35:48,622
(Answer: Barbershop drawing)

2832
01:35:48,623 --> 01:35:49,623
Okay.

2833
01:35:50,023 --> 01:35:51,093
- Correct.
- Okay.

2834
01:35:52,133 --> 01:35:53,233
- It was "barbershop." - "Toilet."

2835
01:35:53,263 --> 01:35:54,263
It's correct.

2836
01:35:54,264 --> 01:35:56,033
Once again, Sang Uk pays twice.

2837
01:35:56,733 --> 01:35:59,032
Were there barbershops then?

2838
01:35:59,033 --> 01:36:01,672
- Barbershops.
- I thought of a gym.

2839
01:36:01,673 --> 01:36:03,143
- It was hard.
- Will you order one to go?

2840
01:36:03,303 --> 01:36:04,373
Of course.

2841
01:36:04,703 --> 01:36:06,812
- Please prepare them separately.
- How much is the total?

2842
01:36:06,813 --> 01:36:08,242
(Orders)

2843
01:36:08,243 --> 01:36:09,512
- Do you want the total?
- Yes.

2844
01:36:09,513 --> 01:36:11,082
- It's 220 dollars.
- That's not bad.

2845
01:36:11,083 --> 01:36:12,512
- That's not bad.
- It's good.

2846
01:36:12,513 --> 01:36:14,052
Just the orders to go?

2847
01:36:14,053 --> 01:36:15,353
- Just the orders to go?
- Yes. It's 220 dollars.

2848
01:36:15,583 --> 01:36:17,022
- That's not bad.
- It doesn't put...

2849
01:36:17,023 --> 01:36:18,622
- too much pressure on us.
- That's right.

2850
01:36:18,623 --> 01:36:19,623
The 369 Game?

2851
01:36:19,624 --> 01:36:22,093
Woo Il, let's play the original version.

2852
01:36:22,423 --> 01:36:24,422
- It's hard if you don't understand.
- Let's do this.

2853
01:36:24,423 --> 01:36:26,332
You guys have played the game many times.

2854
01:36:26,333 --> 01:36:27,392
What are you talking about? It was my first time.

2855
01:36:27,393 --> 01:36:29,232
- It'll be my first time.
- We haven't played it before.

2856
01:36:29,233 --> 01:36:30,332
- I think..
- We haven't played it before.

2857
01:36:30,333 --> 01:36:32,172
- We haven't played it before.
- We haven't played it before.

2858
01:36:32,173 --> 01:36:33,733
- We just think it's fun.
- Are you sure?

2859
01:36:34,133 --> 01:36:35,342
- Right now...
- But...

2860
01:36:35,343 --> 01:36:36,602
you guys did so well earlier.

2861
01:36:36,603 --> 01:36:38,512
- No. We just think it's fun.
- You guys did so well earlier.

2862
01:36:38,513 --> 01:36:39,672
- Woo Il.
- That's why we want to play it.

2863
01:36:39,673 --> 01:36:40,872
We've played it a few times, right?

2864
01:36:40,873 --> 01:36:42,342
Sang Uk hasn't played it once.

2865
01:36:42,343 --> 01:36:43,512
It'll be much easier for you.

2866
01:36:43,513 --> 01:36:45,912
Let's start with me...

2867
01:36:45,913 --> 01:36:47,912
- and go in this direction.
- Okay.

2868
01:36:47,913 --> 01:36:48,922
- In this direction?
- Yes.

2869
01:36:48,923 --> 01:36:51,383
- I'm in trouble.
- Hold on.

2870
01:36:51,653 --> 01:36:53,292
Maybe you made the calculations.

2871
01:36:53,293 --> 01:36:55,193
- No.
- I might go in this direction.

2872
01:36:55,623 --> 01:36:57,062
- I can go in any direction.
- Which one will it be?

2873
01:36:57,063 --> 01:36:59,193
I'll turn my head to signify the direction.

2874
01:36:59,933 --> 01:37:01,803
- I'll turn my head. "O." - Good.

2875
01:37:02,263 --> 01:37:04,062
- "O, ne." I'll do that.
- That's so funny.

2876
01:37:04,063 --> 01:37:05,172
- All right.
- Keep this in mind.

2877
01:37:05,173 --> 01:37:06,572
- No matter who gets picked, - That's right.

2878
01:37:06,573 --> 01:37:08,942
- don't whine about it.
- Okay.

2879
01:37:08,943 --> 01:37:09,972
- Hold on.
- Okay.

2880
01:37:09,973 --> 01:37:11,273
It's more nerve-racking than a UFC match.

2881
01:37:11,713 --> 01:37:12,972
(I agree.)

2882
01:37:12,973 --> 01:37:14,112
- Okay. It's one syllable.
- Okay.

2883
01:37:14,113 --> 01:37:15,342
- Let's begin.
- Set, go.

2884
01:37:15,343 --> 01:37:16,483
- Three, six, nine - Three, six, nine

2885
01:37:16,813 --> 01:37:19,013
(The man who hasn't played the Single Syllable 369 Game before)

2886
01:37:19,513 --> 01:37:22,153
(The man who doesn't understand the Single Syllable 369 Game)

2887
01:37:22,423 --> 01:37:24,993
(Out of the 6 members, only 1 will pay for the orders to go!)

2888
01:37:25,123 --> 01:37:26,123
- O.
- Ne.

2889
01:37:26,123 --> 01:37:27,123
Two.

2890
01:37:27,123 --> 01:37:28,123
- Four.
- Fi.

2891
01:37:28,123 --> 01:37:29,123
Ve.

2892
01:37:29,393 --> 01:37:30,393
- Se.
- Ven.

2893
01:37:30,394 --> 01:37:31,423
- Ei.
- Ght.

2894
01:37:32,063 --> 01:37:33,092
- Ten.
- E.

2895
01:37:33,093 --> 01:37:34,093
- Le.
- Ven.

2896
01:37:34,094 --> 01:37:35,163
- Twel.
- Ve.

2897
01:37:35,263 --> 01:37:36,263
(Thir, teen)

2898
01:37:36,264 --> 01:37:37,363
- Four.
- O.

2899
01:37:38,273 --> 01:37:40,132
(It's game over!)

2900
01:37:40,133 --> 01:37:41,273
- Four.
- O.

2901
01:37:46,573 --> 01:37:48,583
(Screaming)

2902
01:37:49,413 --> 01:37:51,083
(Screaming)

2903
01:37:52,383 --> 01:37:53,883
(Groaning)

2904
01:37:54,653 --> 01:37:56,183
(Groaning)

2905
01:37:56,523 --> 01:37:59,193
(Cry of despair)

2906
01:37:59,323 --> 01:38:01,153
It was so nerve-racking.

2907
01:38:01,253 --> 01:38:03,322
- It was so nerve-racking.
- I was so nervous.

2908
01:38:03,323 --> 01:38:04,323
(He's frozen due to shock.)

2909
01:38:04,463 --> 01:38:05,933
(Groaning)

2910
01:38:06,593 --> 01:38:07,832
- What was up with Sang Uk?
- I thought...

2911
01:38:07,833 --> 01:38:09,333
that Sang Uk would mess up, but he did well.

2912
01:38:09,533 --> 01:38:11,463
My head suddenly went blank.

2913
01:38:11,533 --> 01:38:13,072
I kept speeding up the rhythm...

2914
01:38:13,073 --> 01:38:14,902
- by half a beat.
- You did that.

2915
01:38:14,903 --> 01:38:16,143
But he kept going.

2916
01:38:16,443 --> 01:38:18,343
- His reaction speed was no joke.
- Seriously.

2917
01:38:18,513 --> 01:38:20,143
I knew that it wouldn't end quickly.

2918
01:38:20,543 --> 01:38:21,543
Is your heart okay?

2919
01:38:22,713 --> 01:38:23,783
I mean,

2920
01:38:24,113 --> 01:38:25,413
it was so scary.

2921
01:38:26,013 --> 01:38:28,853
When the three of you clapped.

2922
01:38:28,923 --> 01:38:30,553
I was like, "What's this?"

2923
01:38:30,583 --> 01:38:32,252
- "What's going on?" - It was doable.

2924
01:38:32,253 --> 01:38:34,093
I didn't know what to do.

2925
01:38:34,593 --> 01:38:36,393
"How many people are clapping?"

2926
01:38:36,823 --> 01:38:38,493
You'll come again, right?

2927
01:38:38,633 --> 01:38:40,932
- To where?
- This show.

2928
01:38:40,933 --> 01:38:41,962
- This show?
- Yes.

2929
01:38:41,963 --> 01:38:43,602
From tomorrow onward, I'll call...

2930
01:38:43,603 --> 01:38:44,972
five junior comedians to my house every day...

2931
01:38:44,973 --> 01:38:47,132
- to play the 369 Game.
- Will you practice?

2932
01:38:47,133 --> 01:38:48,372
I think it'll be fun.

2933
01:38:48,373 --> 01:38:49,602
The Single Syllable 369 Game.

2934
01:38:49,603 --> 01:38:51,302
- The Single Syllable 369 Game.
- Yes.

2935
01:38:51,303 --> 01:38:52,513
I'll call them every day.

2936
01:38:52,713 --> 01:38:54,872
- You'll train for the game.
- "Hey, let's practice."

2937
01:38:54,873 --> 01:38:56,043
I think it'll be nice.

2938
01:38:56,543 --> 01:38:57,682
It was great.

2939
01:38:57,683 --> 01:38:58,712
(They finish the meals in Shindang-dong.)

2940
01:38:58,713 --> 01:38:59,882
(Dried fish: Fresh water parsley and monkfish go well together!)

2941
01:38:59,883 --> 01:39:01,012
(Steamed brown croaker is savory like dried yellow croaker.)

2942
01:39:01,013 --> 01:39:02,182
(You can taste the firm flesh of the brown croaker.)

2943
01:39:02,183 --> 01:39:03,352
(The salty grilled cuttlefish makes you crave for a drink.)

2944
01:39:03,353 --> 01:39:04,622
(The taste is clean without being too spicy.)

2945
01:39:04,623 --> 01:39:05,823
(All the dishes will suit people's tastes!)

2946
01:39:06,493 --> 01:39:08,992
- The total is 77 dollars.
- Okay.

2947
01:39:08,993 --> 01:39:10,522
(Sang Uk pays for dinner.)

2948
01:39:10,523 --> 01:39:12,133
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2949
01:39:12,963 --> 01:39:14,692
The total is 220 dollars.

2950
01:39:14,693 --> 01:39:16,403
Isn't it 200 dollars?

2951
01:39:16,433 --> 01:39:17,762
- It's 220 dollars.
- Is that so?

2952
01:39:17,763 --> 01:39:20,002
(Total: 220 dollars)

2953
01:39:20,003 --> 01:39:21,802
- Thank you, Woo Il.
- Thank you.

2954
01:39:21,803 --> 01:39:23,503
- You even gave us a gift.
- Enjoy the food.

2955
01:39:23,643 --> 01:39:25,442
Thank you for your hard work. I'll enjoy the food.

2956
01:39:25,443 --> 01:39:26,642
- Enjoy the food.
- I'll enjoy it.

2957
01:39:26,643 --> 01:39:27,842
Please enjoy the food.

2958
01:39:27,843 --> 01:39:29,412
- Thank you.
- Please enjoy the food.

2959
01:39:29,413 --> 01:39:32,913
(We had good meals in Sindang-dong and Yaksu-dong.)

2960
01:39:33,172 --> 01:39:34,271
What's this place?

2961
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:35,942
(The 11th neighborhood)

2962
01:39:36,042 --> 01:39:38,142
We're in Namyeong-dong today.

2963
01:39:38,242 --> 01:39:42,352
(The taste became deeper as the neighborhood aged.)

2964
01:39:42,382 --> 01:39:43,552
(The food with history)

2965
01:39:44,052 --> 01:39:45,892
(Sang Uk will absolutely love these dishes.)

2966
01:39:46,252 --> 01:39:47,752
(So why is Sang Uk missing?)

2967
01:39:47,822 --> 01:39:49,822
(Sang Uk's position is in danger.)

2968
01:39:50,322 --> 01:39:56,462
(Park Ju Hyun and Kang Hoon want to take his position, )

2969
01:39:57,302 --> 01:39:59,031
(Qualification of being on Handsome Guys: Big appetite)

2970
01:39:59,032 --> 01:40:00,072
(She's qualified.)

2971
01:40:00,172 --> 01:40:02,501
I'm determined to eat today.

2972
01:40:02,502 --> 01:40:05,101
Hold on. Why aren't you ordering the cold bun cha?

2973
01:40:05,102 --> 01:40:06,272
I'm not done yet.

2974
01:40:07,472 --> 01:40:09,112
(The two foodies have the best chemistry.)

2975
01:40:09,142 --> 01:40:11,141
Would you give me Coca-Cola Zero Sugar?

2976
01:40:11,142 --> 01:40:14,212
(She's an honorary member of Handsome Guys.)

2977
01:40:14,552 --> 01:40:15,681
It's so tasty.

2978
01:40:15,682 --> 01:40:16,782
Is there a different expression?

2979
01:40:16,822 --> 01:40:18,251
It's so, so tasty.

2980
01:40:18,252 --> 01:40:20,191
(He even describes the taste like Sang Uk.)

2981
01:40:20,192 --> 01:40:21,421
(At this rate, )

2982
01:40:21,422 --> 01:40:23,362
(they might become the new members.)

2983
01:40:24,922 --> 01:40:29,002
(But he refuses to become a former member.)

2984
01:40:29,402 --> 01:40:30,632
What?

2985
01:40:30,962 --> 01:40:32,731
(Trapped in the same place, )

2986
01:40:32,732 --> 01:40:34,972
(their emotions get tangled up.)

2987
01:40:35,072 --> 01:40:38,342
(We'll show the spirits of the new members.)

2988
01:40:38,442 --> 01:40:40,312
(How can they eat so well?)

2989
01:40:40,572 --> 01:40:45,252
(Sang Uk refuses to lose.)

2990
01:40:45,612 --> 01:40:49,452
(The eating show of the old member and the new members gets heated up.)

2991
01:40:49,552 --> 01:40:53,092
(Who will stay on Handsome Guys?)

2992
01:40:53,493 --> 01:40:55,493
Dramaday.me
