1
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:16,392
(Will it be fried chicken...)

2
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:17,393
(or pizza?)

3
00:00:17,523 --> 00:00:18,592
(Will it be tripe...)

4
00:00:18,593 --> 00:00:19,762
(or galbi?)

5
00:00:19,763 --> 00:00:21,992
(After making the choice...)

6
00:00:21,993 --> 00:00:26,432
(Exultation...)

7
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:28,172
(and regret)

8
00:00:28,173 --> 00:00:30,873
(Anguish and resolution)

9
00:00:31,773 --> 00:00:35,443
(The time of abundance)

10
00:00:35,573 --> 00:00:37,742
(For modern people who suffer from such a dilemma)

11
00:00:37,743 --> 00:00:43,022
(The menu conflict agents, Handsome Guys)

12
00:00:43,023 --> 00:00:45,053
(It starts again today.)

13
00:00:45,483 --> 00:00:48,323
(A sunny day in April)

14
00:00:48,653 --> 00:00:51,323
(With warm spring in the air)

15
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:56,863
(This easygoing place is...)

16
00:00:57,663 --> 00:00:58,833
Olympic Park.

17
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:02,233
- It's good to see you. - Hello.

18
00:01:02,803 --> 00:01:04,963
- Gosh, this place... - It's Olympic Gymnastics Arena.

19
00:01:05,273 --> 00:01:06,712
(Olympic Gymnastics Arena)

20
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:08,643
I know this place very well.

21
00:01:09,443 --> 00:01:10,482
You know it very well?

22
00:01:10,483 --> 00:01:11,842
I had a sports event here.

23
00:01:11,843 --> 00:01:13,229
- What type of event? - A UFC event.

24
00:01:13,253 --> 00:01:14,412
- Was it over here? - Yes, in Korea.

25
00:01:14,413 --> 00:01:16,582
I was in a UFC match ten years ago.

26
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:17,623
Did you get hit a lot?

27
00:01:17,753 --> 00:01:19,673
I didn't get hit at all. I hit 97 times and won.

28
00:01:20,493 --> 00:01:21,622
- Really? - I mean, finger flicks.

29
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,792
I see.

30
00:01:22,793 --> 00:01:24,192
- I didn't get hit at all. - Seriously?

31
00:01:24,193 --> 00:01:26,339
When you hit someone like this, it doesn't hurt at all.

32
00:01:26,363 --> 00:01:27,763
The referee still stopped me.

33
00:01:28,063 --> 00:01:29,132
Maybe it looked painful.

34
00:01:29,133 --> 00:01:31,003
All he did was cling to the opponent.

35
00:01:31,203 --> 00:01:32,433
Cicada Kim.

36
00:01:32,703 --> 00:01:35,072
Do you know how hard it is to cling to someone?

37
00:01:35,073 --> 00:01:36,342
- For the viewers... - The clinging technique is...

38
00:01:36,343 --> 00:01:38,342
- extremely hard. - It's very boring for the viewers.

39
00:01:38,343 --> 00:01:40,343
I agree. I admit that it's boring.

40
00:01:42,413 --> 00:01:43,742
I don't watch my matches either.

41
00:01:43,743 --> 00:01:44,982
(The talk of his old times ends with tears.)

42
00:01:44,983 --> 00:01:46,653
- Olympic Gymnastics Arena. - We're...

43
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:49,222
- in Jamsil. - Many performances take place here.

44
00:01:49,223 --> 00:01:50,352
It's a very famous place.

45
00:01:50,353 --> 00:01:51,922
Jamsil is my hometown.

46
00:01:51,923 --> 00:01:52,992
- Really? - How?

47
00:01:52,993 --> 00:01:54,122
- Are you from Jamsil? - How so?

48
00:01:54,123 --> 00:01:56,492
I'm originally from Cheongju in Chungcheong Province.

49
00:01:56,493 --> 00:01:58,539
- Did you live here for a long time? - I lived in Jamsil for a long time.

50
00:01:58,563 --> 00:01:59,632
I see.

51
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:04,103
Back then, there was a guy who gave me his apartment.

52
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:06,193
- He gave you his apartment? - He gave it to you?

53
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:07,502
He told me...

54
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:09,303
to move into his place and pay monthly rent.

55
00:02:09,443 --> 00:02:12,002
I lived there for a while. When the contract term was over,

56
00:02:12,003 --> 00:02:13,912
I moved to another neighborhood in Songpa-dong.

57
00:02:13,913 --> 00:02:15,272
- In this area? - I rented another place.

58
00:02:15,273 --> 00:02:18,183
My parents also moved to this area.

59
00:02:18,383 --> 00:02:21,212
Last week, my sister moved here. My entire family lives here.

60
00:02:21,213 --> 00:02:24,123
I lived in Jamsil, Bangi, and Songpa.

61
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:25,883
I lived in all those neighborhoods.

62
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:28,392
Is there a reason why you like Jamsil?

63
00:02:28,393 --> 00:02:29,722
Why did you live here for a long time?

64
00:02:29,723 --> 00:02:31,093
This place.

65
00:02:31,323 --> 00:02:33,692
Olympic Park is what makes Jamsil a nice place.

66
00:02:33,693 --> 00:02:36,002
- I agree. - This is unbelievable.

67
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:37,003
The park?

68
00:02:37,004 --> 00:02:39,202
You can take walks and exercise...

69
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:41,272
at this park.

70
00:02:41,273 --> 00:02:42,672
- It's an incredible advantage. - One of the landmarks is...

71
00:02:42,673 --> 00:02:44,002
Olympic Park.

72
00:02:44,003 --> 00:02:46,672
Most concerts take place in Jamsil.

73
00:02:46,673 --> 00:02:47,742
Musicals take place here too.

74
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:49,042
There's also a baseball stadium.

75
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,643
Don't forget about the baseball stadium.

76
00:02:50,713 --> 00:02:52,342
Also, there's Seokchon Lake.

77
00:02:52,343 --> 00:02:53,652
You can see cherry blossoms too.

78
00:02:53,653 --> 00:02:54,752
(Filled with cherry blossoms in the spring)

79
00:02:54,753 --> 00:02:56,482
Just behind, there's Songnidan-gil Street.

80
00:02:56,483 --> 00:02:58,123
Yes, that's exactly right.

81
00:02:58,423 --> 00:03:00,322
It's a famous place to go on dates.

82
00:03:00,323 --> 00:03:02,403
You can also go to Lotte World if you have children.

83
00:03:02,663 --> 00:03:03,762
Lotte World?

84
00:03:03,763 --> 00:03:05,643
- Definitely. - You can go there every weekend.

85
00:03:06,033 --> 00:03:08,932
- It's a wonderful place. - It really is.

86
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:09,933
It's great.

87
00:03:10,163 --> 00:03:12,332
By the way, Sang Uk is missing again.

88
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:13,973
He's done with the competition,

89
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:18,473
but his transfer flight got delayed.

90
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:20,113
He couldn't come even after a week?

91
00:03:20,773 --> 00:03:22,093
He didn't get kicked out, did he?

92
00:03:22,413 --> 00:03:24,442
- Tell us clearly. - As you know,

93
00:03:24,443 --> 00:03:27,283
in the competitive variety show industry,

94
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:29,082
two absences in a row...

95
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,353
- can be critical. - I feel anxious for him.

96
00:03:31,383 --> 00:03:33,153
Rhymer always tells me...

97
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:35,192
to invite him to the show anytime.

98
00:03:35,193 --> 00:03:36,722
- Rhymer contacted me too. - Right.

99
00:03:36,723 --> 00:03:37,992
"We hit it off so well."

100
00:03:37,993 --> 00:03:39,192
He said that we hit it off very well.

101
00:03:39,193 --> 00:03:40,892
He told me to call him when we need to pay.

102
00:03:40,893 --> 00:03:42,263
(Or call me when you need to pay.)

103
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:44,132
I miss Rhymer with beer.

104
00:03:44,133 --> 00:03:45,832
- Rhymer with beer is the best. - He's the best.

105
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,232
It's not pizza or chicken with beer. It's Rhymer with beer.

106
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:50,242
Unfortunately, Sang Uk couldn't be here today.

107
00:03:50,243 --> 00:03:51,503
Then who's coming today?

108
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,943
Is Rhymer coming?

109
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:54,543
I mentioned him a moment ago.

110
00:03:54,873 --> 00:03:56,282
The guy who gave me his apartment is coming.

111
00:03:56,283 --> 00:03:57,283
- What? - What?

112
00:03:57,284 --> 00:03:58,842
The person who let you live at his place is...

113
00:03:58,843 --> 00:03:59,912
- a celebrity? - Are you serious?

114
00:03:59,913 --> 00:04:01,813
Don't lie. Are you serious?

115
00:04:01,953 --> 00:04:03,382
He contacted me, so I know who it is.

116
00:04:03,383 --> 00:04:05,122
- So he gave you his place... - The person who let you live...

117
00:04:05,123 --> 00:04:06,253
Hello!

118
00:04:06,623 --> 00:04:07,792
Hello.

119
00:04:07,793 --> 00:04:10,062
(He appears while showing off his height.)

120
00:04:10,063 --> 00:04:11,292
- Hello. - Hello.

121
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:12,322
Nice to meet you.

122
00:04:12,323 --> 00:04:13,463
Hello.

123
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:14,563
Hey.

124
00:04:16,203 --> 00:04:18,503
- Hello, Tae Hyun. - Daniel, what are you...

125
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:20,802
(From a lawyer...)

126
00:04:20,803 --> 00:04:22,433
(to a doctor)

127
00:04:22,643 --> 00:04:24,873
(An actor specializing in intelligent roles)

128
00:04:25,103 --> 00:04:26,903
(When you open up and get to know him better)

129
00:04:27,613 --> 00:04:30,013
(He's a guy next door with familiar charms.)

130
00:04:30,143 --> 00:04:33,553
(How will he appear on Handsome Guys?)

131
00:04:33,813 --> 00:04:36,223
(Actor Choi Daniel)

132
00:04:36,453 --> 00:04:37,583
Hello.

133
00:04:38,383 --> 00:04:39,492
I'm Choi Daniel.

134
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:41,422
Thank you so much for inviting me on Handsome Guys.

135
00:04:41,423 --> 00:04:45,193
Handsome Guys' fans, I'm happy to be here.

136
00:04:45,363 --> 00:04:46,393
Nice to meet you.

137
00:04:46,993 --> 00:04:48,313
We don't have that many fans yet.

138
00:04:48,493 --> 00:04:49,762
Don't say that.

139
00:04:49,763 --> 00:04:51,333
By the way, you gave him an apartment?

140
00:04:51,803 --> 00:04:53,902
- An apartment? - He doesn't have his own place.

141
00:04:53,903 --> 00:04:55,202
(What are you talking about?)

142
00:04:55,203 --> 00:04:56,972
- That's what Yi Kyung said. - Back then.

143
00:04:56,973 --> 00:04:59,642
Yes, that was about 12 years ago.

144
00:04:59,643 --> 00:05:01,572
- It was at least ten years ago. - It's been longer than that.

145
00:05:01,573 --> 00:05:02,642
It's been more than ten years.

146
00:05:02,643 --> 00:05:04,182
Were you well-off then?

147
00:05:04,183 --> 00:05:05,542
- Then? - How did you give him an apartment?

148
00:05:05,543 --> 00:05:07,782
I was financially struggling too.

149
00:05:07,783 --> 00:05:08,882
That's impressive.

150
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:12,083
Usually, you pay the deposit and monthly rent.

151
00:05:12,423 --> 00:05:13,892
He moved out without taking the deposit,

152
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:15,122
so I only had to pay monthly rent.

153
00:05:15,123 --> 00:05:16,422
I moved out to another place.

154
00:05:16,423 --> 00:05:17,722
- So you lived there. - I did.

155
00:05:17,723 --> 00:05:19,243
That was when I started to make money.

156
00:05:19,663 --> 00:05:20,832
He should be grateful.

157
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,832
- The deposit isn't a small sum. - Right.

158
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,103
Usually, it's 100 dollars for every 10,000 dollars.

159
00:05:25,303 --> 00:05:27,673
Thanks to him, you didn't have to pay.

160
00:05:27,873 --> 00:05:29,842
- You're very quick with numbers. - Aren't I?

161
00:05:29,843 --> 00:05:31,902
We met for the first time. Aren't you younger than me?

162
00:05:31,903 --> 00:05:33,773
- I was born in 1985. - Early in 1985?

163
00:05:33,973 --> 00:05:36,242
I've been your huge fan.

164
00:05:36,243 --> 00:05:38,012
- Really? - On "Time Expeditionary Force..."

165
00:05:38,013 --> 00:05:39,453
- and "Great Escape." - In the past?

166
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:41,252
- Not as a UFC champion? - I thought you'd talk about UFC.

167
00:05:41,253 --> 00:05:42,782
(He thought that he'd talk about UFC.)

168
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,452
- Him in variety shows... - What was your nickname?

169
00:05:44,453 --> 00:05:45,522
Maggie Gun?

170
00:05:45,523 --> 00:05:46,693
It's not Maggie Gun.

171
00:05:46,953 --> 00:05:48,892
What are you talking about?

172
00:05:48,893 --> 00:05:50,139
- What was the name? - "Maggie Gun?"

173
00:05:50,163 --> 00:05:51,392
Maggie Gun is...

174
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:52,522
- Didn't you have a nickname? - Cicada.

175
00:05:52,523 --> 00:05:53,562
Cicada.

176
00:05:53,563 --> 00:05:54,762
- You got it confused. - It was something Gun.

177
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:56,633
Cicada plus Stun Gun became Maggie Gun.

178
00:05:57,063 --> 00:05:58,333
He turned it into Maggie.

179
00:05:58,603 --> 00:06:00,273
- I've been your fan. - Gosh.

180
00:06:00,533 --> 00:06:02,073
I should be careful today.

181
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,502
Anyway,

182
00:06:03,503 --> 00:06:05,702
let me tell you since you're here.

183
00:06:05,703 --> 00:06:07,373
We're going to have lunch.

184
00:06:08,473 --> 00:06:10,012
- Did you bring your credit card? - Card?

185
00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:11,742
I told you to bring your personal card.

186
00:06:11,743 --> 00:06:13,282
- Show me. - I brought my wallet.

187
00:06:13,283 --> 00:06:14,352
Well done.

188
00:06:14,353 --> 00:06:15,512
I carry my wallet with me.

189
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:17,482
Please get a new wallet.

190
00:06:17,483 --> 00:06:18,552
Get yourself a new one.

191
00:06:18,553 --> 00:06:20,122
This is from my fan.

192
00:06:20,123 --> 00:06:21,492
- Your fan? - It's a present from my fan.

193
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:22,862
My name is written on it.

194
00:06:22,863 --> 00:06:24,822
- With the date of your birth? - Wait.

195
00:06:24,823 --> 00:06:26,062
My name is written on it.

196
00:06:26,063 --> 00:06:27,193
(Folding)

197
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:29,132
(Playing dumb)

198
00:06:29,133 --> 00:06:30,362
Did you see that?

199
00:06:30,363 --> 00:06:31,932
- Hey. - He just...

200
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,533
- You shouldn't take that much. - Is he a thief?

201
00:06:34,573 --> 00:06:35,602
(Keeping him quiet)

202
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,273
Hey, give me another bill.

203
00:06:37,673 --> 00:06:39,642
(Returning his money)

204
00:06:39,643 --> 00:06:41,412
Why are you taking everything from my wallet?

205
00:06:41,413 --> 00:06:43,313
We always do this to our guests.

206
00:06:43,343 --> 00:06:44,983
Guests don't get any favorable treatment.

207
00:06:45,143 --> 00:06:46,482
It has nothing to do with favorable treatment.

208
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:47,712
Let me add onto that.

209
00:06:47,713 --> 00:06:49,682
Last week, Rhymer was with us as our guest.

210
00:06:49,683 --> 00:06:51,483
He spent about 600 dollars.

211
00:06:52,353 --> 00:06:53,852
Don't tell him that.

212
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:55,993
You might have to pay over 1,000 dollars today.

213
00:06:56,293 --> 00:06:58,092
No way.

214
00:06:58,093 --> 00:06:59,933
- That's ridiculous. - Is it breaking records?

215
00:07:00,233 --> 00:07:01,693
Tae Hyun, I'm a guest, right?

216
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,563
I thought you were Sang Uk.

217
00:07:04,063 --> 00:07:05,862
You're like Sang Uk with a different face.

218
00:07:05,863 --> 00:07:07,032
- Right. - Goodness.

219
00:07:07,033 --> 00:07:08,572
From now on, you're one of the members.

220
00:07:08,573 --> 00:07:11,502
- We'll treat you like a member. - Make yourself at home.

221
00:07:11,503 --> 00:07:14,743
- So what are we eating today? - Today's menu is...

222
00:07:15,373 --> 00:07:18,513
(Jamsil that's full of diverse charms)

223
00:07:19,043 --> 00:07:21,012
(Songnidan-gil Street)

224
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:23,022
(Garak Market)

225
00:07:23,023 --> 00:07:24,923
(Food Street)

226
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:26,893
(Among various tastes that are hiding inside)

227
00:07:27,693 --> 00:07:32,193
(Spicy taste that stimulates the appetite)

228
00:07:32,723 --> 00:07:38,333
(Fresh taste with the natural taste of the ingredient)

229
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,703
(Curious taste with an unusual look)

230
00:07:43,043 --> 00:07:46,513
(Among them, which will Handsome Guys recommend today?)

231
00:07:47,513 --> 00:07:51,613
- I said Jamsil was my hometown. - Yes.

232
00:07:51,783 --> 00:07:54,312
I'll recommend you some places I know.

233
00:07:54,313 --> 00:07:56,753
- That's great. - I've been to one of them.

234
00:07:57,323 --> 00:08:00,084
I'm curious about the other place because it's so popular these days.

235
00:08:00,423 --> 00:08:01,492
(Anticipating)

236
00:08:01,493 --> 00:08:02,892
At the place you've been to, have you tried the food?

237
00:08:02,893 --> 00:08:04,322
I think we went there together once.

238
00:08:04,323 --> 00:08:06,462
- With me? - Yes, it's very famous.

239
00:08:06,463 --> 00:08:08,263
- Which restaurant is it? - It's J Gamjatang.

240
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,732
I don't think I've been there.

241
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:11,432
- You might be able to recognize it. - You think?

242
00:08:11,433 --> 00:08:12,532
- The gamjatang restaurant? - It's that famous.

243
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,772
My family has been running a gamjatang restaurant...

244
00:08:14,773 --> 00:08:16,243
- for over 16 years. - Really?

245
00:08:16,343 --> 00:08:18,203
- Seriously? - Everyone in Daejeon knows...

246
00:08:18,473 --> 00:08:19,712
about my parents' gamjatang restaurant.

247
00:08:19,713 --> 00:08:21,342
You must be an expert.

248
00:08:21,343 --> 00:08:23,223
- I ate it every day. - Will you get gamjatang?

249
00:08:23,443 --> 00:08:26,513
I don't want to eat it if I can avoid it.

250
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:28,612
I try not to eat jokbal or gamjatang.

251
00:08:28,613 --> 00:08:30,013
(I don't like jokbal or gamjatang.)

252
00:08:30,183 --> 00:08:31,903
- There's another restaurant. - What is it?

253
00:08:32,023 --> 00:08:33,992
The type of food is different. The place I want to go to.

254
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:35,652
- This is mine. - It's a Thai restaurant.

255
00:08:35,653 --> 00:08:36,763
That sounds good.

256
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:39,322
Here's why I want to go there.

257
00:08:39,323 --> 00:08:41,493
- It sounds good. - Recently, Lee Yeong Ja...

258
00:08:42,363 --> 00:08:44,633
She recommended the place, but it was already popular.

259
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,402
What's their signature dish?

260
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:48,902
- It's called jokbal over rice. - Really?

261
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,142
- Jokbal over rice? - Jokbal with rice...

262
00:08:50,143 --> 00:08:51,673
(Jokbal over rice?)

263
00:08:52,473 --> 00:08:53,743
He doesn't like jokbal either.

264
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:56,213
The only things I don't eat are jokbal and gamjatang.

265
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:58,583
I try to avoid them.

266
00:08:59,213 --> 00:09:02,152
I've had so much jokbal and gamjatang in my life...

267
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:03,822
- You should go back home. - No.

268
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:04,852
There will be other dishes.

269
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:05,982
Let's decide.

270
00:09:05,983 --> 00:09:07,252
It must be hard for everyone to choose.

271
00:09:07,253 --> 00:09:08,253
You can't decide either, can you?

272
00:09:08,254 --> 00:09:10,962
I still prefer the Thai restaurant.

273
00:09:10,963 --> 00:09:13,832
- Really? - There will be other dishes.

274
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,062
I pick Thai food.

275
00:09:15,063 --> 00:09:16,262
- Thai food? - Thai food.

276
00:09:16,263 --> 00:09:17,732
I want Thai food too.

277
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:20,133
I don't usually eat gamjatang.

278
00:09:20,403 --> 00:09:22,232
- I pick Thai food. - What's your choice?

279
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:24,402
- How about you? Gamjatang? - I'll get gamjatang.

280
00:09:24,403 --> 00:09:25,573
I pick Thai food.

281
00:09:25,973 --> 00:09:27,142
(Thai food, Thai food, Thai food, gamjatang, Thai food)

282
00:09:27,143 --> 00:09:28,773
Enjoy your food over there.

283
00:09:29,573 --> 00:09:31,112
Give him back his credit card.

284
00:09:31,113 --> 00:09:32,542
(Everyone looks so happy. Why is that?)

285
00:09:32,543 --> 00:09:33,913
You can shoot...

286
00:09:34,183 --> 00:09:36,082
- and eat alone today. - Hold on.

287
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,822
Why do we always have to split into 2 and 3 or 3 and 3?

288
00:09:38,823 --> 00:09:40,522
- Exactly. - This is possible too.

289
00:09:40,523 --> 00:09:42,822
What's going on? I don't know how this works.

290
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:44,062
You can go and get gamjatang alone.

291
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:45,092
- Really? - Yes.

292
00:09:45,093 --> 00:09:47,192
Sit at a table and look forward.

293
00:09:47,193 --> 00:09:49,033
This is it for the opening segment.

294
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:51,962
Go and get gamjatang alone. Good luck with the shoot.

295
00:09:51,963 --> 00:09:53,072
We'll see you later.

296
00:09:53,073 --> 00:09:54,473
They'll give you two GoPro cameras.

297
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:55,872
You can film yourself.

298
00:09:55,873 --> 00:09:57,573
Why did I even come to this show?

299
00:09:58,603 --> 00:10:00,872
To decide who will play, play rock-paper-scissors with two hands.

300
00:10:00,873 --> 00:10:02,413
The losing hand will pay, okay?

301
00:10:02,543 --> 00:10:03,743
This hand has to pay.

302
00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:05,512
Rock-paper-scissors.

303
00:10:05,513 --> 00:10:06,952
(The assistant instructor steps up to demonstrate.)

304
00:10:06,953 --> 00:10:08,752
I should've filmed myself for YouTube.

305
00:10:08,753 --> 00:10:10,283
Why am I even here?

306
00:10:10,553 --> 00:10:12,082
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

307
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,692
- This hand has to pay. - His right hand will pay.

308
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:14,952
Rock-paper-scissors.

309
00:10:14,953 --> 00:10:17,093
(Muddled)

310
00:10:17,293 --> 00:10:19,192
- We go to where we pick. - Really?

311
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:21,762
- We've never split into 4 and 1. - Is that so?

312
00:10:21,763 --> 00:10:23,762
It might be boring to eat alone.

313
00:10:23,763 --> 00:10:25,202
- I should join him today. - Go ahead.

314
00:10:25,203 --> 00:10:26,702
- I'll go with him today. - Right.

315
00:10:26,703 --> 00:10:27,832
We have many memories in Jamsil.

316
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,072
- All right. - Gamjatang of memories.

317
00:10:29,073 --> 00:10:31,102
Since he and I share many memories in Jamsil...

318
00:10:31,103 --> 00:10:32,302
We'll go to the restaurants together.

319
00:10:32,303 --> 00:10:33,412
- Really? - We stay with the group.

320
00:10:33,413 --> 00:10:35,072
- That's a relief. - Let me explain.

321
00:10:35,073 --> 00:10:36,842
Which restaurant are we going to first?

322
00:10:36,843 --> 00:10:38,943
Today, we'll start with the Thai restaurant.

323
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,583
- This means... - All right.

324
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:44,122
We have to stare at them eating on an empty stomach.

325
00:10:44,123 --> 00:10:45,153
You're right.

326
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,492
This is exciting.

327
00:10:46,493 --> 00:10:49,253
- Let's go to the Thai restaurant. - Let's go.

328
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:51,793
- Are we going like this? - Yes.

329
00:10:53,033 --> 00:10:54,192
We'll take this to get there.

330
00:10:54,193 --> 00:10:55,492
- All of us together? - Yes.

331
00:10:55,493 --> 00:10:56,563
I see.

332
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:02,203
(Handsome Guys got on the vehicle to go to the first restaurant.)

333
00:11:03,203 --> 00:11:05,472
(Glancing around)

334
00:11:05,473 --> 00:11:07,312
Now that we set off, let me tell you.

335
00:11:07,313 --> 00:11:09,143
- You took my seat belt. - Really?

336
00:11:09,513 --> 00:11:11,113
I'm sorry.

337
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,583
Was it not my seat belt?

338
00:11:13,883 --> 00:11:14,883
I'm sorry.

339
00:11:14,884 --> 00:11:16,183
He's being sincere.

340
00:11:16,653 --> 00:11:18,083
No, it's okay.

341
00:11:18,323 --> 00:11:21,393
You seem like... How shall I put this?

342
00:11:22,023 --> 00:11:24,163
- You and I are similar in that... - Aren't I smart?

343
00:11:24,293 --> 00:11:25,523
- Pardon? - Aren't I smart?

344
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:27,803
You always think that you're smart, don't you?

345
00:11:27,993 --> 00:11:30,303
- I'm intelligent. - Intelligent?

346
00:11:30,563 --> 00:11:31,702
(Flustered)

347
00:11:31,703 --> 00:11:33,602
People who aren't smart pretend to be smart.

348
00:11:33,603 --> 00:11:34,872
Have you tested your IQ?

349
00:11:34,873 --> 00:11:37,202
Yes, when I was in elementary school.

350
00:11:37,203 --> 00:11:39,242
- It was a joke back then. - Right.

351
00:11:39,243 --> 00:11:41,119
- I didn't take it seriously. - People cheat too.

352
00:11:41,143 --> 00:11:43,282
In my opinion,

353
00:11:43,283 --> 00:11:45,813
my IQ is about 135.

354
00:11:46,313 --> 00:11:47,753
Can you judge your own IQ?

355
00:11:47,953 --> 00:11:49,953
- Let me explain. - You know what?

356
00:11:50,223 --> 00:11:51,722
(He claims that his IQ is 135.)

357
00:11:51,723 --> 00:11:54,093
- I should use this trick. - I've seen this a lot.

358
00:11:54,223 --> 00:11:55,292
- I'm serious. - He's strange.

359
00:11:55,293 --> 00:11:58,292
When I get my IQ tested, it's always over 140.

360
00:11:58,293 --> 00:11:59,422
Really?

361
00:11:59,423 --> 00:12:01,762
- When I get it tested... - Mine is between 135 and 140.

362
00:12:01,763 --> 00:12:03,603
When was the last time you got it tested?

363
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:08,732
Who bets on their IQ like them?

364
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:09,973
Can you change your own IQ?

365
00:12:10,203 --> 00:12:12,473
"Is yours 135? Mine is 140."

366
00:12:13,143 --> 00:12:14,942
It changes more often than real estate prices.

367
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,042
It's between 135 and 140.

368
00:12:17,043 --> 00:12:18,813
It's somewhere in between.

369
00:12:19,213 --> 00:12:20,382
(They arrive while betting on their IQ.)

370
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:21,483
Shall we get off?

371
00:12:23,223 --> 00:12:25,252
Jamsil has a unique air about it. Hello.

372
00:12:25,253 --> 00:12:26,752
(Songnidan-gil Street, a popular place in Songpa)

373
00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:27,822
Is it like...

374
00:12:27,823 --> 00:12:29,622
- Is this it? - The place has changed.

375
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,362
It has changed, but the atmosphere is the same.

376
00:12:31,363 --> 00:12:32,363
- Right. - Yes.

377
00:12:32,364 --> 00:12:34,292
- So this is your hometown? - Definitely.

378
00:12:34,293 --> 00:12:35,433
We hung out at this place.

379
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:37,302
Tae Hyun, this is Food Street.

380
00:12:37,303 --> 00:12:38,532
- Here? - Yes.

381
00:12:38,533 --> 00:12:40,309
- Over here too. - The street is full of restaurants.

382
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,413
- These are all popular restaurants. - They're good.

383
00:12:42,673 --> 00:12:43,742
Come this way.

384
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:44,879
(Which restaurant will Handsome Guys visit first?)

385
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:46,472
Do you see people waiting in line?

386
00:12:46,473 --> 00:12:47,753
It's another popular restaurant.

387
00:12:48,443 --> 00:12:51,143
(Looking around)

388
00:12:51,283 --> 00:12:52,783
It's right here.

389
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:55,482
- What? - This is it.

390
00:12:55,483 --> 00:12:56,582
Why are there two signboards?

391
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,683
They just left the old signboard.

392
00:13:00,023 --> 00:13:02,222
"Electricity?" It used to be a lighting store.

393
00:13:02,223 --> 00:13:03,693
The name of the signboard...

394
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:06,292
Look. "A chef at the embassy..."

395
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:07,593
(Run by a chef at the embassy)

396
00:13:09,193 --> 00:13:12,063
(High turnover and number 1 as the most revisited restaurant)

397
00:13:12,463 --> 00:13:15,673
(It became popular as the godmother of gourmet, Lee Yeong Ja's pick.)

398
00:13:16,373 --> 00:13:20,243
(Not everyone has tried it, but no one has tried it only once.)

399
00:13:27,283 --> 00:13:31,782
(LMR 1: Homemade Thai food)

400
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:33,493
Hello.

401
00:13:34,323 --> 00:13:36,862
- Based on what I see... - Hello.

402
00:13:36,863 --> 00:13:38,163
- Hello. - The smell is...

403
00:13:40,093 --> 00:13:41,632
It's a real Thai restaurant.

404
00:13:41,633 --> 00:13:45,263
(There's a strong Thai smell as soon as they enter.)

405
00:13:49,173 --> 00:13:51,143
Everyone, please sit down.

406
00:13:52,703 --> 00:13:54,043
I have so many questions.

407
00:13:54,373 --> 00:13:55,812
- Are you the restaurant owner? - Yes, I am.

408
00:13:55,813 --> 00:13:57,442
(Lee Chang Jo, the restaurant owner and chef)

409
00:13:57,443 --> 00:13:59,342
Why is there a sign for electricity?

410
00:13:59,343 --> 00:14:03,622
Before I opened my restaurant here,

411
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:06,152
someone was running a store...

412
00:14:06,153 --> 00:14:07,892
for electric appliances.

413
00:14:07,893 --> 00:14:09,852
As I wanted to run the business in one spot...

414
00:14:09,853 --> 00:14:11,522
for a long time like him,

415
00:14:11,523 --> 00:14:13,763
- I used the same name. - You used the same name.

416
00:14:13,933 --> 00:14:15,062
That's unique.

417
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:17,132
- That's key. - You got the name from his store?

418
00:14:17,133 --> 00:14:18,832
Are you currently working at the embassy?

419
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:21,372
Yes, there's an event tonight,

420
00:14:21,373 --> 00:14:22,432
so I must go there.

421
00:14:22,433 --> 00:14:24,172
Are you still working there?

422
00:14:24,173 --> 00:14:25,742
Yes, I'm working at both places.

423
00:14:25,743 --> 00:14:27,642
In terms of time, is it possible?

424
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:31,082
This is what I dreamed of doing.

425
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:34,582
Since you work at the embassy, do you work in public service?

426
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,013
Is this your second job?

427
00:14:36,283 --> 00:14:39,123
- Can you run your own restaurant? - Actually...

428
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:42,253
Are you here to investigate him?

429
00:14:43,363 --> 00:14:44,423
Tell us!

430
00:14:44,823 --> 00:14:46,392
One moment, please.

431
00:14:46,393 --> 00:14:48,232
I'm taking down notes. I'm listening.

432
00:14:48,233 --> 00:14:50,203
He must really love cooking.

433
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:52,203
Excuse me.

434
00:14:52,263 --> 00:14:54,732
- If you're done, can we order? - Let's eat.

435
00:14:54,733 --> 00:14:56,902
- Sir, what should we order? - Is there a menu?

436
00:14:56,903 --> 00:14:59,742
It's written over there. Jokbal over rice and shrimp gukbap?

437
00:14:59,743 --> 00:15:02,172
- Yes, those are the 2. - There are only 2.

438
00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:03,342
You can order those.

439
00:15:03,343 --> 00:15:05,283
Should we get two of each?

440
00:15:05,943 --> 00:15:08,782
Let's order 2 jokbal over rice, and 2 shrimp gukbap.

441
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:10,753
- All right. - We'll order those.

442
00:15:12,253 --> 00:15:13,753
(Looking around)

443
00:15:14,053 --> 00:15:16,253
He seems very detailed.

444
00:15:16,323 --> 00:15:19,562
I bet the chef painted the ceiling like this intentionally.

445
00:15:19,563 --> 00:15:20,893
- Am I right? - You're right.

446
00:15:21,063 --> 00:15:22,232
He did it intentionally.

447
00:15:22,233 --> 00:15:24,462
- I go to Thailand for training. - Did you paint it on purpose?

448
00:15:24,463 --> 00:15:25,732
When I go to Thailand or Vietnam,

449
00:15:25,733 --> 00:15:27,402
local restaurants look like this.

450
00:15:27,403 --> 00:15:28,532
The ceiling is painted white.

451
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:31,213
(You can see traces of Thailand everywhere in the interior design.)

452
00:15:33,173 --> 00:15:34,772
These are switches you see in Thailand.

453
00:15:34,773 --> 00:15:36,372
Are the frames Thai too?

454
00:15:36,373 --> 00:15:38,183
Yes, they look exactly like them.

455
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:40,152
All of these look Thai.

456
00:15:40,153 --> 00:15:41,912
- That's a Thai calendar. - It's not Thai.

457
00:15:41,913 --> 00:15:43,353
It says "Daegu" on it.

458
00:15:43,923 --> 00:15:45,452
"Daegu?" Wait a minute.

459
00:15:45,453 --> 00:15:47,622
It clearly says "Daegu" on it.

460
00:15:47,623 --> 00:15:49,823
(Daegu is written on it.)

461
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:52,223
(Flustered)

462
00:15:52,323 --> 00:15:54,632
- Is this from Korea? - Yes, it is.

463
00:15:54,633 --> 00:15:56,532
- It's from Korea? - It's from Daegu.

464
00:15:56,533 --> 00:15:59,763
(Hello in Thai)

465
00:16:00,133 --> 00:16:02,003
- It's from Daegu. - That's a Thai calendar.

466
00:16:03,103 --> 00:16:04,903
(Glancing)

467
00:16:05,303 --> 00:16:06,772
You shouldn't touch it.

468
00:16:06,773 --> 00:16:08,273
Can't we pick up a spoon?

469
00:16:08,373 --> 00:16:10,582
- You can pick it up. - It won't be necessary.

470
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,512
- Can I have some water? - Sure.

471
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:14,653
- Water is fine. - Let's drink some water.

472
00:16:15,153 --> 00:16:16,952
(Let's drink some water at least.)

473
00:16:16,953 --> 00:16:18,053
Thank you.

474
00:16:18,183 --> 00:16:21,022
(While they calm down their hunger with cold water)

475
00:16:21,023 --> 00:16:22,992
Here's shrimp gukbap for each of you.

476
00:16:22,993 --> 00:16:24,692
- This is... - Shrimp gukbap.

477
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,363
It looks delicious.

478
00:16:26,523 --> 00:16:28,533
- What's that? - Oh, my.

479
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:30,362
This is definitely a tasty restaurant.

480
00:16:30,363 --> 00:16:31,732
Suddenly, I'm starving.

481
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:32,813
(Gukbap that's just served)

482
00:16:34,473 --> 00:16:42,473
(The simplest Thai gukbap to settle your stomach at lunchtime)

483
00:16:48,053 --> 00:16:54,253
(First dish, shrimp gukbap)

484
00:16:54,723 --> 00:16:56,253
It looks so good.

485
00:16:56,293 --> 00:16:57,693
First,

486
00:16:57,793 --> 00:17:00,192
it smells like bean sprout gukbap.

487
00:17:00,193 --> 00:17:02,163
Yes, it's so fascinating.

488
00:17:03,903 --> 00:17:05,062
That looks amazing.

489
00:17:05,063 --> 00:17:08,873
(It's time to taste shrimp gukbap.)

490
00:17:11,473 --> 00:17:16,513
(Drinking the broth straight from the bowl)

491
00:17:18,543 --> 00:17:22,253
(While feeling moved, he takes a bite of solid ingredients.)

492
00:17:24,783 --> 00:17:26,993
This is just incredible.

493
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:31,622
It feels like I drank even though I didn't.

494
00:17:31,623 --> 00:17:34,143
(It's so refreshing that it cures a hangover without drinking.)

495
00:17:34,193 --> 00:17:38,103
(Seung Ho also takes a bite.)

496
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:40,903
(Savoring with his forehead)

497
00:17:41,473 --> 00:17:44,573
(Tae Hyun also takes a spoonful.)

498
00:17:45,243 --> 00:17:48,113
(As expected, he finishes by drinking from the bowl.)

499
00:17:48,813 --> 00:17:50,073
It's so good.

500
00:17:51,083 --> 00:17:52,282
This is insane.

501
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:54,512
(Jealous)

502
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:55,913
It looks so good.

503
00:17:56,213 --> 00:17:58,582
It's slightly sweet.

504
00:17:58,583 --> 00:18:01,223
It's spicy and refreshing.

505
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,692
It's similar to bean sprout gukbap.

506
00:18:03,693 --> 00:18:07,063
It's like bean sprout gukbap with a lot of bean sprouts inside.

507
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:09,163
- It looks so good. - This is...

508
00:18:09,263 --> 00:18:11,433
Here's your jokbal over rice.

509
00:18:11,733 --> 00:18:14,132
- Jokbal over rice looks great. - That looks amazing.

510
00:18:14,133 --> 00:18:15,172
- That's incredible. - What?

511
00:18:15,173 --> 00:18:16,603
The meat is extremely tender.

512
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:19,172
This is definitely a tasty restaurant.

513
00:18:19,173 --> 00:18:21,443
- Look at that. - That was quick.

514
00:18:21,813 --> 00:18:25,243
The food is served really fast.

515
00:18:26,113 --> 00:18:28,853
(A big bowl of rice)

516
00:18:29,113 --> 00:18:31,083
(With vegetables to add the texture)

517
00:18:31,783 --> 00:18:35,353
(A chunk of jokbal that clearly looks tender)

518
00:18:35,923 --> 00:18:39,893
(A bit of braised sauce on top)

519
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:48,433
(Second dish, jokbal over rice)

520
00:18:48,633 --> 00:18:51,102
It looks so good. Suddenly, I'm starving.

521
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:52,103
(His mouth is watering.)

522
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,813
(Exclaiming)

523
00:18:55,773 --> 00:18:58,742
- Look how jokbal gets torn easily. - That's amazing.

524
00:18:58,743 --> 00:19:00,753
(Soft)

525
00:19:01,353 --> 00:19:02,682
- That's amazing. - Let me see.

526
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,223
(Getting up)

527
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:05,882
Eat it with the rice.

528
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:07,852
(After putting jokbal on rice)

529
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:10,163
(The moment you taste it)

530
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:11,892
Gosh, what is this?

531
00:19:11,893 --> 00:19:14,033
(In paradise)

532
00:19:14,263 --> 00:19:16,862
- Gosh, what's this? - This is...

533
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,543
(They're stunned by the jokbal over rice.)

534
00:19:18,703 --> 00:19:21,172
(Two men in a daze watch them eat from afar.)

535
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:23,413
- It looks so good. - His reaction shows that it's good.

536
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:25,072
It's amazing.

537
00:19:25,073 --> 00:19:26,573
(It's amazing.)

538
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:30,543
(Tae Hyun's mouth and hands don't stop.)

539
00:19:31,113 --> 00:19:32,182
(The up-and-coming eater in eating shows)

540
00:19:32,183 --> 00:19:33,913
Can you give me the tasty part?

541
00:19:34,113 --> 00:19:36,183
(Can you take a look over here too?)

542
00:19:37,123 --> 00:19:39,183
(Eating)

543
00:19:39,383 --> 00:19:41,423
(Exclaiming)

544
00:19:42,323 --> 00:19:45,823
(He starts with a big bite.)

545
00:19:46,363 --> 00:19:48,962
(Inhaling food...)

546
00:19:48,963 --> 00:19:51,433
(like crazy)

547
00:19:52,103 --> 00:19:53,162
What does it taste like?

548
00:19:53,163 --> 00:19:54,232
(How on earth does it taste?)

549
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:56,032
When you eat gamjatang...

550
00:19:56,033 --> 00:19:57,843
You know...

551
00:19:58,343 --> 00:19:59,642
How shall I put this?

552
00:19:59,643 --> 00:20:02,372
There's pork flavor and beef flavor.

553
00:20:02,373 --> 00:20:04,243
It's obvious when it's delicious.

554
00:20:04,943 --> 00:20:06,742
It looks so good.

555
00:20:06,743 --> 00:20:08,282
You should try it.

556
00:20:08,283 --> 00:20:09,882
Let's hurry and...

557
00:20:09,883 --> 00:20:11,482
Which one is better?

558
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:13,553
- I can't choose. - Are they that good?

559
00:20:14,123 --> 00:20:16,692
- Sir, did you make jokbal yourself? - Yes.

560
00:20:16,693 --> 00:20:18,369
- He wouldn't buy it prepared. - I mean...

561
00:20:18,393 --> 00:20:22,032
How long do you cook it to make it like this?

562
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:24,162
I cook it all day long.

563
00:20:24,163 --> 00:20:26,233
- For the meat to be that tender. - Right.

564
00:20:27,173 --> 00:20:31,473
(There's a special secret behind this restaurant.)

565
00:20:32,073 --> 00:20:35,673
(There's a space just for jokbal.)

566
00:20:36,843 --> 00:20:39,282
(The owner who is serious about making jokbal...)

567
00:20:39,283 --> 00:20:41,713
(starts working early in the morning...)

568
00:20:43,313 --> 00:20:49,353
(to make it taste even better.)

569
00:20:51,823 --> 00:20:57,263
(It's where he puts in all his effort.)

570
00:20:59,563 --> 00:21:06,843
(The tender jokbal with a deep flavor born in there)

571
00:21:08,343 --> 00:21:10,582
It looks so good. Suddenly, I'm starving.

572
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,682
Daniel,

573
00:21:12,683 --> 00:21:14,053
- nice to meet you. - Hello.

574
00:21:14,113 --> 00:21:16,683
(He was fooling him.)

575
00:21:17,823 --> 00:21:19,982
(Yes, this is the taste.)

576
00:21:19,983 --> 00:21:21,552
- Give us a chance to try some. - Goodness.

577
00:21:21,553 --> 00:21:22,722
We're waiting.

578
00:21:22,723 --> 00:21:25,823
It goes very well with rice like soy sauce marinated crab.

579
00:21:26,823 --> 00:21:28,332
My mouth is watering.

580
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:29,862
If we wait, we'll get a chance.

581
00:21:29,863 --> 00:21:31,633
- I'm not joking. - Why...

582
00:21:31,763 --> 00:21:34,203
Can we proceed with the quiz?

583
00:21:34,273 --> 00:21:35,432
I agree with everything.

584
00:21:35,433 --> 00:21:37,002
- Dong Hyun, can we do the quiz? - Sure.

585
00:21:37,003 --> 00:21:38,072
- Could you... - You know what?

586
00:21:38,073 --> 00:21:39,643
I can't wait to let you taste it.

587
00:21:39,773 --> 00:21:41,573
(That's how they got the chance.)

588
00:21:41,643 --> 00:21:42,843
Complete the proverb.

589
00:21:43,143 --> 00:21:44,182
"Complete the proverb?"

590
00:21:44,183 --> 00:21:45,782
Once bitten?

591
00:21:45,783 --> 00:21:47,013
My gosh.

592
00:21:47,283 --> 00:21:49,783
Twice relieved.

593
00:21:50,723 --> 00:21:52,622
- Incorrect. - Okay.

594
00:21:52,623 --> 00:21:53,922
Once bitten, twice flinching.

595
00:21:53,923 --> 00:21:55,523
- No, that's not it. - Incorrect.

596
00:21:55,553 --> 00:21:56,952
What's the answer?

597
00:21:56,953 --> 00:21:58,792
- Twice shy. - Is it "twice shy?"

598
00:21:58,793 --> 00:21:59,822
That's not true.

599
00:21:59,823 --> 00:22:02,762
You got bitten already.

600
00:22:02,763 --> 00:22:05,032
So you can't be shy after that.

601
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,363
(Yes, you can!)

602
00:22:06,503 --> 00:22:08,833
(As a result, he watches him eat too.)

603
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:12,643
(Without knowing how Daniel feels, he takes a bite.)

604
00:22:14,143 --> 00:22:17,113
This is driving me insane.

605
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:18,983
(Opening)

606
00:22:19,613 --> 00:22:21,183
It's over.

607
00:22:21,253 --> 00:22:24,182
Can I give him a spoonful to Daniel?

608
00:22:24,183 --> 00:22:26,253
(Me?)

609
00:22:26,383 --> 00:22:28,152
- You can't. - I thought so.

610
00:22:28,153 --> 00:22:29,823
(Eating)

611
00:22:30,093 --> 00:22:33,863
(He just laughs.)

612
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:37,502
It's just the rule.

613
00:22:37,503 --> 00:22:39,703
(I want to give it to you, but I can't break the rule.)

614
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:44,043
Daniel, we usually decide based on your personal talent.

615
00:22:44,543 --> 00:22:45,672
Personal talent?

616
00:22:45,673 --> 00:22:47,812
(Personal talent, all of a sudden?)

617
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:48,873
Personal talent?

618
00:22:50,073 --> 00:22:51,142
Anything works.

619
00:22:51,143 --> 00:22:52,642
(Thinking)

620
00:22:52,643 --> 00:22:54,583
I have one personal talent.

621
00:22:54,713 --> 00:22:55,713
What is it?

622
00:22:55,714 --> 00:22:57,074
I can do an impression of someone.

623
00:22:57,723 --> 00:23:00,592
- I used to do it in middle school. - Okay.

624
00:23:00,593 --> 00:23:01,923
Shin Gu.

625
00:23:02,053 --> 00:23:03,223
- That's difficult. - Yes.

626
00:23:03,653 --> 00:23:04,763
That's difficult.

627
00:23:05,123 --> 00:23:06,443
"You know what crabs taste like?"

628
00:23:06,663 --> 00:23:08,762
- I was in a similar commercial. - Right.

629
00:23:08,763 --> 00:23:10,263
- A hamburger commercial? - Yes.

630
00:23:11,563 --> 00:23:16,903
(It was back in 2002.)

631
00:23:17,843 --> 00:23:19,602
You caught a crab.

632
00:23:19,603 --> 00:23:21,043
You know what crabs taste like?

633
00:23:22,543 --> 00:23:23,713
Here I go.

634
00:23:23,883 --> 00:23:25,142
Judge him objectively.

635
00:23:25,143 --> 00:23:26,223
We'll be totally objective.

636
00:23:28,813 --> 00:23:30,113
You know what?

637
00:23:30,923 --> 00:23:33,453
You insist on knowing how crabs taste, but...

638
00:23:34,453 --> 00:23:36,193
- That's it. - You sounded like yourself.

639
00:23:37,053 --> 00:23:39,423
"You know what?" Didn't I sound the same?

640
00:23:40,093 --> 00:23:42,262
(Embarrassed)

641
00:23:42,263 --> 00:23:43,763
- Was I off? - "You know what?"

642
00:23:44,063 --> 00:23:46,263
How about this one?

643
00:23:46,433 --> 00:23:47,572
- I have another personal talent. - What is it?

644
00:23:47,573 --> 00:23:49,002
We're at a Thai restaurant.

645
00:23:49,003 --> 00:23:50,172
Impersonating Ong-Bak.

646
00:23:50,173 --> 00:23:51,242
(Ong-Bak)

647
00:23:51,243 --> 00:23:52,743
- Ong-Bak. - Ong-Bak.

648
00:23:52,773 --> 00:23:55,173
(What Bak?)

649
00:23:55,813 --> 00:24:00,713
(Another one of Daniel's old personal talents)

650
00:24:01,313 --> 00:24:04,783
("Ong-Bak: The Thai Warrior," a real Muay Thai action movie)

651
00:24:04,853 --> 00:24:06,853
(The flying knee kick is key.)

652
00:24:10,493 --> 00:24:12,022
(Which Muay Thai move will Daniel show?)

653
00:24:12,023 --> 00:24:13,562
- Ong-Bak. - Ong-Bak.

654
00:24:13,563 --> 00:24:15,533
Can you do it outside in front of the restaurant?

655
00:24:16,533 --> 00:24:17,533
While you come in.

656
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:19,132
You want me to do it outside?

657
00:24:19,133 --> 00:24:21,472
- No, while you come in. - Out here?

658
00:24:21,473 --> 00:24:23,103
While you come into the restaurant.

659
00:24:24,373 --> 00:24:26,542
Here's Ong-Bak, everyone.

660
00:24:26,543 --> 00:24:28,642
Wait a minute.

661
00:24:28,643 --> 00:24:30,582
(The performance will start soon.)

662
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:32,113
Can't I do it inside?

663
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:34,706
(Gathering the audience)

664
00:24:34,707 --> 00:24:36,636
Wait a minute.

665
00:24:36,637 --> 00:24:38,476
(The performance will start soon.)

666
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,236
Can't I do it inside? Outside?

667
00:24:40,237 --> 00:24:42,077
You came to a Thai restaurant to eat.

668
00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:43,976
While coming in?

669
00:24:43,977 --> 00:24:45,277
(Embarrassed)

670
00:24:45,917 --> 00:24:47,817
(Full of anticipation)

671
00:24:50,347 --> 00:24:51,417
What's going on?

672
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:53,927
(I don't care anymore.)

673
00:24:56,227 --> 00:24:57,257
(Give me some jokbal.)

674
00:24:57,297 --> 00:24:58,557
(From the side)

675
00:24:59,127 --> 00:25:01,297
(Daniel-Bak, his journey for jokbal)

676
00:25:02,497 --> 00:25:03,797
(Laughing)

677
00:25:04,567 --> 00:25:05,697
My goodness.

678
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:07,867
That was good.

679
00:25:07,907 --> 00:25:10,806
- I enjoyed it. - Coming from outside is impressive.

680
00:25:10,807 --> 00:25:12,437
- Would you give a thumbs-up? - Encore.

681
00:25:12,537 --> 00:25:13,737
Here you go, Daniel.

682
00:25:13,837 --> 00:25:14,946
All right.

683
00:25:14,947 --> 00:25:16,906
- Please remember this. - Okay.

684
00:25:16,907 --> 00:25:18,447
Put some rice in it.

685
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,487
- Try it. It's so delicious. - Seriously.

686
00:25:22,817 --> 00:25:25,817
(His heart is fluttering at maximum.)

687
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:27,887
(Glancing for no reason)

688
00:25:27,987 --> 00:25:30,587
- I'm going to eat. - Okay.

689
00:25:30,727 --> 00:25:32,057
(Wait.)

690
00:25:32,757 --> 00:25:34,896
(We're just joking.)

691
00:25:34,897 --> 00:25:35,927
It's a joke.

692
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:42,337
(He finally tastes the jokbal that he worked hard for.)

693
00:25:43,507 --> 00:25:46,477
(Surprised by how tender it is)

694
00:25:46,977 --> 00:25:48,806
(Surprised again by the flavor)

695
00:25:48,807 --> 00:25:50,177
- It tastes excellent. - Right?

696
00:25:51,647 --> 00:25:53,476
After looking at it for 30 minutes...

697
00:25:53,477 --> 00:25:54,646
(Now that everyone including Daniel tasted it)

698
00:25:54,647 --> 00:25:56,217
Try it with some rice.

699
00:25:56,387 --> 00:25:59,287
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

700
00:25:59,487 --> 00:26:02,327
Among phrases related to eating,

701
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:04,157
this is not used in Thailand.

702
00:26:04,297 --> 00:26:05,357
What could it be?

703
00:26:05,727 --> 00:26:06,727
"Thank you for the food?"

704
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:10,196
We don't know Thai at all.

705
00:26:10,197 --> 00:26:11,736
- Say it in Korean. - Can we say it in Korean?

706
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:13,966
Daniel is even more surprising.

707
00:26:13,967 --> 00:26:15,567
He asked, "How would we say it in Thai?"

708
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,636
- Should we answer in Thai? - No, in Korean.

709
00:26:17,637 --> 00:26:18,706
In Korean?

710
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:19,777
I said the same thing.

711
00:26:20,707 --> 00:26:22,776
(I found my soulmate.)

712
00:26:22,777 --> 00:26:24,746
He said that it was a phrase in Thailand.

713
00:26:24,747 --> 00:26:26,316
- Right. - I thought the answer was in Thai.

714
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:27,947
- Our brains must be similar. - Yes.

715
00:26:28,817 --> 00:26:30,386
- Isn't your IQ 140? - It's 140.

716
00:26:30,387 --> 00:26:32,587
Mine is between 135 and 140.

717
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,957
When I eat breakfast, my IQ becomes 139.

718
00:26:35,457 --> 00:26:37,026
When I'm not doing well without breakfast,

719
00:26:37,027 --> 00:26:38,527
it becomes 135.

720
00:26:38,857 --> 00:26:40,656
Our brains must be similar.

721
00:26:40,657 --> 00:26:41,897
We only think about the future.

722
00:26:42,297 --> 00:26:45,266
There are so many phrases related to eating.

723
00:26:45,267 --> 00:26:46,467
There are many situations.

724
00:26:46,767 --> 00:26:48,867
I think it's either "I'll enjoy the food..."

725
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:52,237
or "I enjoyed the food."

726
00:26:52,907 --> 00:26:55,507
I narrowed it down to four phrases.

727
00:26:56,177 --> 00:26:57,347
Four phrases?

728
00:26:57,817 --> 00:26:59,946
The 1st and 2nd are what Seung Ho said.

729
00:26:59,947 --> 00:27:01,867
- "I'll enjoy the food." - "I enjoyed the food."

730
00:27:02,447 --> 00:27:04,386
"It's delicious" or "It's not delicious."

731
00:27:04,387 --> 00:27:05,717
I think it's 1 of the 4.

732
00:27:06,517 --> 00:27:07,526
I'm 100 percent certain.

733
00:27:07,527 --> 00:27:09,487
When food is served,

734
00:27:09,957 --> 00:27:12,227
they would say...

735
00:27:12,757 --> 00:27:15,197
- something kap. - Khop khun kap. Sawasdee kap.

736
00:27:15,797 --> 00:27:17,366
They would say something kap.

737
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:18,743
I'm sure they'll say, "I'll enjoy the food."

738
00:27:18,767 --> 00:27:22,467
In my opinion, the answer could be "khop khun kap."

739
00:27:22,867 --> 00:27:24,277
- "Khop khun kap?" - Thank you.

740
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,777
You've been to Thailand so many times.

741
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:29,776
And you never learned...

742
00:27:29,777 --> 00:27:31,577
how to say "I'll enjoy the food" in Thai?

743
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:33,076
Didn't you say that before eating?

744
00:27:33,077 --> 00:27:35,487
I don't think there is such an expression.

745
00:27:35,817 --> 00:27:37,287
Is there a time limit?

746
00:27:37,817 --> 00:27:40,317
- There's no time limit. - It can go endlessly.

747
00:27:40,457 --> 00:27:42,356
This is considered very short.

748
00:27:42,357 --> 00:27:43,626
- We can take an hour. - Sometimes, we take an hour.

749
00:27:43,627 --> 00:27:44,656
We eat for an hour,

750
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:45,726
and we discuss for an hour.

751
00:27:45,727 --> 00:27:47,443
(Usually, 1 hour of eating and 1 hour for the quiz)

752
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:48,727
I don't know.

753
00:27:50,397 --> 00:27:51,757
I'd go with "I'll enjoy the food."

754
00:27:52,497 --> 00:27:53,766
- That one? - Let's go with it.

755
00:27:53,767 --> 00:27:54,837
"I'll enjoy the food."

756
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,006
As you said, they might just say thank you...

757
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,327
instead of "I'll enjoy the food."

758
00:27:58,607 --> 00:28:00,506
The answer is "I'll enjoy the food."

759
00:28:00,507 --> 00:28:03,046
(Answer: I'll enjoy the food.)

760
00:28:03,047 --> 00:28:04,777
- It could be "I'm full." - No way.

761
00:28:05,347 --> 00:28:06,976
- Could it be correct? - Your answer is...

762
00:28:06,977 --> 00:28:08,986
(Answer: I'll enjoy the food.)

763
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,017
It's correct.

764
00:28:10,787 --> 00:28:13,287
- We got it right. - That's insane.

765
00:28:14,287 --> 00:28:15,656
- Really? - Seriously?

766
00:28:15,657 --> 00:28:16,686
- Hey. - See? I was right.

767
00:28:16,687 --> 00:28:18,356
That's what I thought.

768
00:28:18,357 --> 00:28:20,626
When food was served, people did this before eating.

769
00:28:20,627 --> 00:28:22,066
- Are you ready? - For what?

770
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,303
We have to play against each other.

771
00:28:23,327 --> 00:28:24,496
You and I need to solve the quiz.

772
00:28:24,497 --> 00:28:25,597
Really? Okay.

773
00:28:26,367 --> 00:28:29,067
In tom yum kung, a traditional Thai dish,

774
00:28:29,607 --> 00:28:31,877
"yum" means mixing.

775
00:28:32,207 --> 00:28:33,537
It refers to the salad.

776
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,607
"Kung" means shrimp.

777
00:28:36,007 --> 00:28:38,476
- Then what does "tom" mean? - I got it.

778
00:28:38,477 --> 00:28:39,517
Broth.

779
00:28:40,347 --> 00:28:41,347
- Incorrect. - What?

780
00:28:41,447 --> 00:28:43,217
You can look at what's in tom yum kung.

781
00:28:44,087 --> 00:28:45,156
- I got it. - Yes?

782
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:46,186
(Me!)

783
00:28:46,187 --> 00:28:47,857
- Vegetables. - Incorrect.

784
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:50,187
He said "yum" means salad.

785
00:28:50,327 --> 00:28:52,756
- Daniel. - I don't like tom yum kung,

786
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:54,227
so I don't usually eat it.

787
00:28:54,397 --> 00:28:55,627
- Tom... - I got it.

788
00:28:56,097 --> 00:28:57,097
Soup.

789
00:28:58,367 --> 00:28:59,666
- Incorrect. - I thought so.

790
00:28:59,667 --> 00:29:01,366
- Your first guess was "broth." - Yes.

791
00:29:01,367 --> 00:29:02,507
Now you said "soup."

792
00:29:02,637 --> 00:29:03,736
- I got it. - Interpret it differently.

793
00:29:03,737 --> 00:29:05,307
- Water. - Incorrect.

794
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:06,806
I mean, he guessed soup.

795
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:07,807
- Think of it differently. - I guessed water.
- Right. - What else is there?

796
00:29:08,808 --> 00:29:09,847
Think of it differently.

797
00:29:10,077 --> 00:29:11,317
- Differently? - Differently.

798
00:29:12,177 --> 00:29:13,747
I got it. Water?

799
00:29:16,447 --> 00:29:17,987
- Never mind. - Daniel,

800
00:29:18,317 --> 00:29:19,817
please take out your card.

801
00:29:20,387 --> 00:29:21,587
Take out your card.

802
00:29:21,857 --> 00:29:24,757
He told us to say it differently.

803
00:29:25,327 --> 00:29:26,427
- I got it. - Yes?

804
00:29:27,157 --> 00:29:28,296
- Boiled? - Correct.

805
00:29:28,297 --> 00:29:29,397
- Okay. - What?

806
00:29:30,567 --> 00:29:31,997
Really?

807
00:29:32,867 --> 00:29:34,137
Thank you for the food.

808
00:29:34,237 --> 00:29:36,167
Is that correct? Do I have to pay?

809
00:29:36,407 --> 00:29:37,407
(Daniel gets to pay for the first LMR.)

810
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,736
If this keeps happening,

811
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:41,676
guests including those who are older than us...

812
00:29:41,677 --> 00:29:43,307
won't come anymore.

813
00:29:43,777 --> 00:29:45,177
- So... - Then do you want to pay?

814
00:29:45,477 --> 00:29:46,516
That's not what I mean.

815
00:29:46,517 --> 00:29:47,616
You should pay this time.

816
00:29:47,617 --> 00:29:48,647
- Me? - Yes.

817
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,017
I shouldn't have said it.

818
00:29:51,787 --> 00:29:53,686
- Should I pay for it? - No, I'll pay.

819
00:29:53,687 --> 00:29:54,856
- I'll pay at this restaurant. - No.

820
00:29:54,857 --> 00:29:55,857
We'll be eating more anyway...
including gamjatang.

821
00:29:56,858 --> 00:29:58,227
You might have to pay again.

822
00:29:58,327 --> 00:30:01,126
I wouldn't pay four consecutive times, would I?

823
00:30:01,127 --> 00:30:02,766
- Last week, Rhymer did. - Last week, Rhymer did.

824
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:03,996
- Did he? - That's why...

825
00:30:03,997 --> 00:30:05,536
I'm trying to help you from the start.

826
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:06,666
- I want to be supportive. - It's okay.

827
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:07,736
Are you confident about winning the second time?

828
00:30:07,737 --> 00:30:08,836
Of course.

829
00:30:08,837 --> 00:30:10,313
- Let's go. Thank you for the food. - I'll pay.

830
00:30:10,337 --> 00:30:11,677
Thank you for the food.

831
00:30:13,377 --> 00:30:15,376
- I mean... - I wanted to help him.

832
00:30:15,377 --> 00:30:18,216
(Total: 82 dollars)

833
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:19,716
- Please sign. - I paid,

834
00:30:19,717 --> 00:30:21,687
but I didn't even get a proper meal.

835
00:30:21,787 --> 00:30:23,946
- I only got to taste it. - I'm afraid guests will stop...

836
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:24,956
coming.

837
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:27,356
(The first LMR meal is over.)

838
00:30:27,357 --> 00:30:29,586
Now it's time for me and Daniel to take revenge.

839
00:30:29,587 --> 00:30:31,227
Right. Let's get some gamjatang.

840
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:33,757
The other guys ate so much a moment ago.

841
00:30:34,027 --> 00:30:35,967
Once they see it, they'll want to taste it.

842
00:30:36,727 --> 00:30:39,237
I've had gamjatang all my life.

843
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,566
Dong Hyun, I'll give you some.

844
00:30:40,567 --> 00:30:42,407
I don't want any. I had it all my life.

845
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:44,737
Diet dance.

846
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:47,006
How about some diet dance now that we ate a lot?

847
00:30:47,007 --> 00:30:48,646
- Let's go and dance. - To lose weight.

848
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:50,406
Does the morning class still exist?

849
00:30:50,407 --> 00:30:51,577
It's right here.

850
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:53,576
This place is very famous.

851
00:30:53,577 --> 00:30:54,717
Parking is not allowed.

852
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:56,987
- Parking is not allowed. - It's the entrance.

853
00:30:57,247 --> 00:31:00,056
Daniel, you might be able to remember this place.

854
00:31:00,057 --> 00:31:01,656
Have we eaten here together?

855
00:31:01,657 --> 00:31:02,687
It's possible.

856
00:31:03,427 --> 00:31:05,826
(By many apartment residents in Jamsil)

857
00:31:05,827 --> 00:31:08,567
(A gamjatang restaurant that's been loved for 30 years)

858
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:12,297
After seeing YouTubers and influencers come here...

859
00:31:12,437 --> 00:31:15,337
As Sung Si Kyung shot at this place...

860
00:31:15,467 --> 00:31:18,307
I came here to come to a famous restaurant.

861
00:31:19,007 --> 00:31:21,376
(Where office workers can have a meal during the day)

862
00:31:21,377 --> 00:31:23,817
(A place where you can have drinks after work in the evening)

863
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:27,047
(LMR 2: Gamjatang)

864
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,186
- It was on "Wednesday Food Talk." - Hello.

865
00:31:30,187 --> 00:31:32,016
- Hello. - It's a famous place.

866
00:31:32,017 --> 00:31:33,056
Let's see.

867
00:31:33,057 --> 00:31:35,027
(A tasty gamjatang restaurant verified by many)

868
00:31:35,257 --> 00:31:37,157
There's only one thing on the menu.

869
00:31:37,587 --> 00:31:38,857
This place is different.

870
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,726
I had no intention of eating here,

871
00:31:41,727 --> 00:31:42,827
but...

872
00:31:43,227 --> 00:31:44,766
- By the way, - How does it feel?

873
00:31:44,767 --> 00:31:47,837
My family has been running a gamjatang restaurant for 16 years.

874
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:49,967
However, I've never seen a gamjatang patent before.

875
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:51,606
- Is there a patent? - Their gamjatang recipe...

876
00:31:51,607 --> 00:31:52,906
has been patented.

877
00:31:52,907 --> 00:31:53,976
I see.

878
00:31:53,977 --> 00:31:56,376
They make things that my mother can't make including jokbal.

879
00:31:56,377 --> 00:31:58,553
(Today's jokbal and gamjatang are different from his family's.)

880
00:31:58,577 --> 00:32:00,316
- Hello. - Hello.

881
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:01,847
I came here a long time ago.

882
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:03,317
- Ma'am. - Thirty years?

883
00:32:03,687 --> 00:32:06,116
Have you renovated this place within the last ten years?

884
00:32:06,117 --> 00:32:07,117
- Yes. - Right?

885
00:32:07,118 --> 00:32:08,527
Also, wasn't it...

886
00:32:08,957 --> 00:32:10,387
- People sat on the floor. - Right?

887
00:32:10,657 --> 00:32:11,756
- They sat on the floor? - Yes.

888
00:32:11,757 --> 00:32:14,367
- Tables must have been different. - Customers sat on the floor.

889
00:32:14,627 --> 00:32:16,587
- People sat on the floor. - We sat on the floor.

890
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:19,666
- What kind of patent is this? - How did you get it?

891
00:32:19,667 --> 00:32:20,937
My mom hasn't gotten it.

892
00:32:21,337 --> 00:32:22,436
That's a secret.

893
00:32:22,437 --> 00:32:23,506
I see.

894
00:32:23,507 --> 00:32:25,607
Anyway, you have a gamjatang patent.

895
00:32:25,637 --> 00:32:27,276
- That's right. - It's a secret.

896
00:32:27,277 --> 00:32:28,346
This place is...

897
00:32:28,347 --> 00:32:30,206
How many orders...

898
00:32:30,207 --> 00:32:31,823
- You should order. - How many will you order?

899
00:32:31,847 --> 00:32:33,216
These three can't eat...

900
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:34,546
- right away. - Okay.

901
00:32:34,547 --> 00:32:36,987
- Can we get one medium size... - Medium.

902
00:32:37,117 --> 00:32:38,586
- Medium? - for the two of us?

903
00:32:38,587 --> 00:32:39,916
All right.

904
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:41,656
I have to try this.

905
00:32:41,657 --> 00:32:43,087
As a bone expert,

906
00:32:43,457 --> 00:32:45,726
I can tell if the meat is Korean or imported.

907
00:32:45,727 --> 00:32:47,226
Then you should try it.

908
00:32:47,227 --> 00:32:49,627
- If the meat is Korean... - I'm sorry,

909
00:32:50,197 --> 00:32:51,573
but why should we give it to you for free?

910
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:53,696
You even acted Ong-Bak.

911
00:32:53,697 --> 00:32:54,806
I can tell by looking at it.

912
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:57,836
Last time, I acted Ong-Bak and did an impression of someone.

913
00:32:57,837 --> 00:32:58,936
I'm ready to be Ong-Bak.

914
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:00,136
(Ong-Bak Kim is ready to attack.)

915
00:33:00,137 --> 00:33:01,607
No, that's not good enough anymore.

916
00:33:01,877 --> 00:33:03,646
How about this? There's a tree over there.

917
00:33:03,647 --> 00:33:05,167
- Can you act like a cicada? - Cicada?

918
00:33:05,217 --> 00:33:07,346
Just hang onto the tree and stay still.

919
00:33:07,347 --> 00:33:08,387
Cicada Gun.

920
00:33:08,647 --> 00:33:10,787
If you promise to give me a bite, I'll do it.

921
00:33:10,917 --> 00:33:12,786
(Laughing)

922
00:33:12,787 --> 00:33:14,156
I have a memory of this place.

923
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:16,727
Back when I was in my 20s and penniless,

924
00:33:16,957 --> 00:33:19,526
I came here with my seniors from Seoul Institute of the Arts.

925
00:33:19,527 --> 00:33:20,626
- To this place? - Yes.

926
00:33:20,627 --> 00:33:22,467
There was a group called 8390.

927
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,536
Whenever we had a meeting, we came here at night.

928
00:33:24,537 --> 00:33:25,897
Why did you come all the way here?

929
00:33:25,997 --> 00:33:27,267
I was living in Jamsil.

930
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:29,436
- Did they come here to see you? - All of them lived in Jamsil.

931
00:33:29,437 --> 00:33:31,106
Everyone born from 1983 to 1990 came...

932
00:33:31,107 --> 00:33:32,206
all the way here just to see you?

933
00:33:32,207 --> 00:33:33,847
I told you that everyone lived in Jamsil.

934
00:33:34,507 --> 00:33:36,746
It doesn't seem like these two listen to others.

935
00:33:36,747 --> 00:33:38,747
You don't listen to others, do you?

936
00:33:39,077 --> 00:33:40,246
Me neither.

937
00:33:40,247 --> 00:33:41,986
It's because they have high IQ.

938
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:44,116
- From 135 to 140. - His is 135, and yours is 140.

939
00:33:44,117 --> 00:33:45,556
- People like them don't listen. - No.

940
00:33:45,557 --> 00:33:47,256
Mine is between 135 and 140.

941
00:33:47,257 --> 00:33:48,487
- Okay. - His IQ is 140.

942
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:51,126
My minimum IQ is 140.

943
00:33:51,127 --> 00:33:52,897
- Did you hear that? - That's your minimum?

944
00:33:53,227 --> 00:33:54,767
- He raised it again. - No way.

945
00:33:55,097 --> 00:33:57,127
Let's test our intelligence next time.

946
00:33:58,197 --> 00:33:59,396
(At that moment, the patented gamjatang arrives.)

947
00:33:59,397 --> 00:34:00,737
There's a lot of food.

948
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:02,136
(The appearance makes you smack your lips.)

949
00:34:02,137 --> 00:34:03,237
This is how it's served.

950
00:34:04,407 --> 00:34:06,327
- It looks like... - I love dried radish greens.

951
00:34:06,937 --> 00:34:08,006
Shall I turn on the heat?

952
00:34:08,007 --> 00:34:10,077
There are a lot of dried radish greens.

953
00:34:10,847 --> 00:34:13,147
The broth is usually red, but this is white.

954
00:34:13,847 --> 00:34:17,287
We use broth made with bones.

955
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:22,356
(To tender meat that's cooked 2 times)

956
00:34:22,357 --> 00:34:26,057
(Adding broth that's cooked for a long time)

957
00:34:27,357 --> 00:34:30,296
(Dried radish greens, potatoes, and seasoning are added.)

958
00:34:30,297 --> 00:34:32,637
(Lastly, add a lot of perilla seed powder.)

959
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:34,367
Seasoning isn't added.

960
00:34:34,807 --> 00:34:38,236
This way, children can enjoy it too.

961
00:34:38,237 --> 00:34:40,406
It's unusual. I've never seen white gamjatang.

962
00:34:40,407 --> 00:34:42,047
- You've never seen it? - No.

963
00:34:42,077 --> 00:34:44,206
- It must still taste good. - Usually, the broth is red.

964
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,216
Right.

965
00:34:45,217 --> 00:34:46,576
Shall I get chopsticks just in case?

966
00:34:46,577 --> 00:34:47,987
That won't be necessary.

967
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:49,663
- That's okay. - Do you need chopsticks?

968
00:34:49,687 --> 00:34:51,517
- Yes. - Do you want to play Ong-Bak?

969
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:53,456
Then will you let me eat some?

970
00:34:53,457 --> 00:34:55,003
If you play Ong-Bak, I'll give you chopsticks.

971
00:34:55,027 --> 00:34:56,926
- Just to get chopsticks, - No way.

972
00:34:56,927 --> 00:34:58,626
- You should let me eat. - he has to play Ong-Bak.

973
00:34:58,627 --> 00:34:59,756
Goodness.

974
00:34:59,757 --> 00:35:01,026
Ong-Bak for chopsticks.

975
00:35:01,027 --> 00:35:02,696
Impression of someone for a spoon.

976
00:35:02,697 --> 00:35:03,896
(Fixed price system for utensils)

977
00:35:03,897 --> 00:35:05,236
- Gosh, this isn't easy. - He fits right in.

978
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:06,237
He fits right in.

979
00:35:06,238 --> 00:35:07,596
After paying once, he fits right in.

980
00:35:07,597 --> 00:35:09,337
The potatoes are already cooked.

981
00:35:09,567 --> 00:35:11,977
Around this time, I'd eat this piece.

982
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,177
- This piece? - Yes.

983
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:18,217
This tastes really good.

984
00:35:18,377 --> 00:35:19,517
Can we start eating?

985
00:35:19,747 --> 00:35:21,247
The meat is already cooked.

986
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:23,416
- First... - This is really good.

987
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:25,233
(He takes a piece that's cooked and serves Daniel first.)

988
00:35:25,257 --> 00:35:27,387
- It looks meaty. - It looks delicious.

989
00:35:28,557 --> 00:35:30,757
(A lot of dried radish greens)

990
00:35:31,057 --> 00:35:33,456
All right. It's not said in Thailand,

991
00:35:33,457 --> 00:35:35,167
only in Japan and Korea.

992
00:35:35,327 --> 00:35:36,427
Thank you for the food.

993
00:35:37,267 --> 00:35:39,027
I was wondering what you were talking about.

994
00:35:39,097 --> 00:35:42,106
As Daniel spoke, I couldn't help but feel like I was listening...

995
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:43,267
to a student teacher.

996
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:46,476
There's something about you that makes you seem intelligent.

997
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,006
- Right? I know. - Yes.

998
00:35:48,007 --> 00:35:49,306
What does "intelligent" mean?

999
00:35:49,307 --> 00:35:51,316
Could you tell us? You've been avoiding it.

1000
00:35:51,317 --> 00:35:54,277
Well, it's something nice.

1001
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:55,746
Something nice?

1002
00:35:55,747 --> 00:35:58,216
Smart and intelligent. That's something nice.

1003
00:35:58,217 --> 00:35:59,756
- Smart and intelligent. - Get your IQ tested again.

1004
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:02,226
- I have an IQ of 135. - I'm sure it's only two digits.

1005
00:36:02,227 --> 00:36:03,526
If I've had breakfast and am feeling good that day,

1006
00:36:03,527 --> 00:36:04,796
I could score 140.

1007
00:36:04,797 --> 00:36:06,456
If I only got four hours of sleep,

1008
00:36:06,457 --> 00:36:08,097
- I'd score 135. - Is that so?

1009
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:11,366
- That makes him intelligent. - Yes, intelligent.

1010
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:12,866
- Can we eat now? - Yes, let's.

1011
00:36:12,867 --> 00:36:14,267
It looks like you deboned the meat.

1012
00:36:14,437 --> 00:36:16,237
It naturally came off the bone.

1013
00:36:19,037 --> 00:36:23,177
(The combo of tender meat and dried radish greens)

1014
00:36:24,547 --> 00:36:26,317
(My gosh)

1015
00:36:26,747 --> 00:36:28,117
The meat is falling off easily.

1016
00:36:29,247 --> 00:36:30,786
The pork is locally sourced.

1017
00:36:30,787 --> 00:36:31,986
(Validated by the expert)

1018
00:36:31,987 --> 00:36:33,417
That must be good.

1019
00:36:33,757 --> 00:36:36,586
The piece Daniel is having is the best.

1020
00:36:36,587 --> 00:36:37,926
- Really? - That's the best piece.

1021
00:36:37,927 --> 00:36:39,896
- This? - The whole piece.

1022
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,466
Yi Kyung must've given me the best piece.

1023
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:42,467
Of course.

1024
00:36:42,468 --> 00:36:43,627
(Touched)

1025
00:36:43,797 --> 00:36:45,766
- You couldn't eat all this. - Tae Hyun, come on.

1026
00:36:45,767 --> 00:36:47,567
(Meat gently topped with dried radish greens)

1027
00:36:48,367 --> 00:36:51,306
You won't believe how nutty and savory gamjatang can be.

1028
00:36:51,307 --> 00:36:52,376
(My gosh)

1029
00:36:52,377 --> 00:36:53,806
The best kind has a milky flavor to it.

1030
00:36:53,807 --> 00:36:54,807
- It's so good. - The bones...
The meat is incredible.

1031
00:36:55,808 --> 00:36:57,477
- The meat is insane. - It's so good.

1032
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:00,746
(Trying the broth as well)

1033
00:37:00,747 --> 00:37:01,817
The broth...

1034
00:37:02,447 --> 00:37:04,186
- It looks good. - You have no idea.

1035
00:37:04,187 --> 00:37:06,657
- It's so good. - It has these dried radish greens.

1036
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:09,127
The juices blend into the broth,

1037
00:37:09,557 --> 00:37:12,227
enriching its flavor...

1038
00:37:12,327 --> 00:37:14,056
and adding a refreshing taste.

1039
00:37:14,057 --> 00:37:15,396
The dried radish greens are amazing.

1040
00:37:15,397 --> 00:37:16,526
(The soaked dried radish greens are incredible too.)

1041
00:37:16,527 --> 00:37:18,036
The dried radish greens are really good.

1042
00:37:18,037 --> 00:37:19,696
This restaurant is known for its food,

1043
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:21,843
and that shows since radish kimchi is the only side dish.

1044
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:24,267
Right? There's only one side dish.

1045
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:25,907
I'll try a piece.

1046
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,047
That looks delicious.

1047
00:37:28,807 --> 00:37:29,977
(My gosh!)

1048
00:37:30,377 --> 00:37:31,777
The radish kimchi is to die for.

1049
00:37:33,377 --> 00:37:35,546
The best thing about having just one dish on the menu...

1050
00:37:35,547 --> 00:37:36,993
is that there's nothing else to worry about.

1051
00:37:37,017 --> 00:37:38,116
Did you just say my name?

1052
00:37:38,117 --> 00:37:39,357
(His hearing isn't that great.)

1053
00:37:39,417 --> 00:37:40,577
- He heard his name. - How...

1054
00:37:40,987 --> 00:37:42,486
How could he have heard his name?

1055
00:37:42,487 --> 00:37:44,433
(Not the best at communicating, but enjoying the same food)

1056
00:37:44,457 --> 00:37:46,857
I'll grab this with my hand and eat the meat on the bones.

1057
00:37:47,457 --> 00:37:51,267
(Meat tastes better when you bite it off the bone.)

1058
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:52,566
I'd love to see it.

1059
00:37:52,567 --> 00:37:54,266
(Munching)

1060
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:55,767
He's famous for it.

1061
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:57,366
Nice. That's how you eat it.

1062
00:37:57,367 --> 00:37:59,127
- That's how you should eat it. - It's good.

1063
00:37:59,807 --> 00:38:01,327
They're not ordering any rice, though.

1064
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:03,346
I think I'm good. The meat is more than enough.

1065
00:38:03,347 --> 00:38:04,776
I enjoy it with ramyeon noodles first...

1066
00:38:04,777 --> 00:38:06,177
and then have stir-fried rice.

1067
00:38:06,917 --> 00:38:10,086
Do they also serve stir-fried rice here?

1068
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:12,517
It doesn't appear from this stew. They make it for us.

1069
00:38:12,687 --> 00:38:14,356
- I know that. - Stir-fried rice doesn't appear...

1070
00:38:14,357 --> 00:38:16,457
- in the pot. - Of course not.

1071
00:38:16,987 --> 00:38:19,397
- Abracadabra. That's not it. - But once we order it...

1072
00:38:19,527 --> 00:38:21,766
To a little of the broth,

1073
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:23,497
you stir-fry rice and dried laver.

1074
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:27,167
- I had no idea. - How could you not know that?

1075
00:38:28,367 --> 00:38:30,136
Can we have more broth and some ramyeon noodles?

1076
00:38:30,137 --> 00:38:32,976
(But first, they'll have ramyeon noodles.)

1077
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,457
Ramyeon noodles didn't cross my mind.

1078
00:38:35,577 --> 00:38:36,777
Nothing can be done about it.

1079
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:43,887
(Slurping noodles technique)

1080
00:38:47,517 --> 00:38:51,087
(The ramyeon noodles are delicious.)

1081
00:38:54,927 --> 00:38:56,727
They've soaked up all the juice.

1082
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:59,007
The customers have to make the stir-fried rice.

1083
00:38:59,797 --> 00:39:02,007
- Do we have to do it? - Yes, it says so right here.

1084
00:39:02,337 --> 00:39:03,367
(My gosh)

1085
00:39:04,267 --> 00:39:05,667
The ramyeon noodles are to die for.

1086
00:39:06,507 --> 00:39:07,776
The ramyeon noodles are delicious.

1087
00:39:07,777 --> 00:39:09,737
The ramyeon noodles are insane. You have no idea.

1088
00:39:10,777 --> 00:39:13,277
(A piece of radish kimchi only makes it better.)

1089
00:39:13,577 --> 00:39:15,617
(Out of envy, his eyes keep dancing around.)

1090
00:39:15,917 --> 00:39:17,417
Is there more water over there?

1091
00:39:17,787 --> 00:39:19,086
- More broth? - No.

1092
00:39:19,087 --> 00:39:20,786
How could you mistake water for broth?

1093
00:39:20,787 --> 00:39:22,126
I said water, but you heard broth.

1094
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:24,086
- Yi Kyung... - I can relate.

1095
00:39:24,087 --> 00:39:25,796
I think destiny brought Daniel and Dong Hyun together.

1096
00:39:25,797 --> 00:39:27,056
- Because... - I can relate.

1097
00:39:27,057 --> 00:39:29,466
The stew has boiled down, so I thought you wanted more broth.

1098
00:39:29,467 --> 00:39:31,627
- That's what I thought. - You were being considerate.

1099
00:39:32,197 --> 00:39:34,196
- You have an IQ of 140, don't you? - I do.

1100
00:39:34,197 --> 00:39:35,906
- It seems that way. - Look at Yi Kyung's face.

1101
00:39:35,907 --> 00:39:37,736
- I can't believe them. - "You have an IQ of 140."

1102
00:39:37,737 --> 00:39:39,136
Also, you can see into the future.

1103
00:39:39,137 --> 00:39:41,547
You thought about the broth in that sense.

1104
00:39:41,807 --> 00:39:42,977
I'm not a seer but...

1105
00:39:43,477 --> 00:39:45,076
I don't have superpowers.

1106
00:39:45,077 --> 00:39:47,446
Now, I'll make the stir-fried rice.

1107
00:39:47,447 --> 00:39:48,847
There's nothing to discard.

1108
00:39:49,117 --> 00:39:50,387
All that's left...

1109
00:39:50,647 --> 00:39:52,586
Adding radish kimchi will enrich the dish.

1110
00:39:52,587 --> 00:39:55,287
Debone the rest of the meat and add it all in.

1111
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:56,756
Good.

1112
00:39:56,757 --> 00:39:59,227
(Cheongyang chili is added to balance out the richness.)

1113
00:40:00,497 --> 00:40:01,867
This is a first for me.

1114
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:04,426
While running a French fries shop for 16 years...

1115
00:40:04,427 --> 00:40:06,337
- Did you say French fries? - What did I say?

1116
00:40:06,897 --> 00:40:10,036
(Laughing)

1117
00:40:10,037 --> 00:40:11,776
"While running a French fries shop for 16 years..."

1118
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:13,507
He must badly want the rice.

1119
00:40:13,807 --> 00:40:15,327
As he processes something in his mind,

1120
00:40:15,907 --> 00:40:17,576
his tongue takes off with autocomplete.

1121
00:40:17,577 --> 00:40:18,717
Yes, that's what happens.

1122
00:40:18,977 --> 00:40:20,546
Can you relate? You say the wrong thing a lot.

1123
00:40:20,547 --> 00:40:21,646
I know how that is.

1124
00:40:21,647 --> 00:40:24,187
- He knows all about it. - I know how it is.

1125
00:40:24,687 --> 00:40:27,116
You only have to get the meaning across.

1126
00:40:27,117 --> 00:40:28,957
Yes, exactly!

1127
00:40:28,987 --> 00:40:30,756
- If only people just understood. - I know.

1128
00:40:30,757 --> 00:40:32,056
I don't expect you to get the details.

1129
00:40:32,057 --> 00:40:33,526
- Just the gist of it. - You get it, right?

1130
00:40:33,527 --> 00:40:35,496
- Just get the meaning across. - How...

1131
00:40:35,497 --> 00:40:36,996
There are people who nitpick, though.

1132
00:40:36,997 --> 00:40:38,717
- I see. - I don't get it all wrong, but...

1133
00:40:39,197 --> 00:40:40,796
This will be the bomb.

1134
00:40:40,797 --> 00:40:42,266
(In the meantime, Yi Kyung has prepared his stir-fried rice.)

1135
00:40:42,267 --> 00:40:43,827
You'll be surprised when you have this.

1136
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:46,076
You seem to have a history with gamjatang,

1137
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,206
but trust me...

1138
00:40:47,207 --> 00:40:48,346
- and give this a try. - Really?

1139
00:40:48,347 --> 00:40:49,446
I'll get a sense of how it tastes.

1140
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,306
Let me help you create fresh memories around gamjatang.

1141
00:40:51,307 --> 00:40:52,316
- Wait. - What?

1142
00:40:52,317 --> 00:40:54,053
Aren't you going to do the "Ong-Bak" for us?

1143
00:40:54,077 --> 00:40:56,016
- You should do at least that. - But...

1144
00:40:56,017 --> 00:40:57,087
It was done earlier.

1145
00:40:57,347 --> 00:40:58,456
(Reluctantly)

1146
00:40:58,457 --> 00:40:59,587
That's the least you can do.

1147
00:41:00,757 --> 00:41:03,087
(I'm Stun Gun.)

1148
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:05,456
(Bring it.)

1149
00:41:05,457 --> 00:41:06,657
(Bring it!)

1150
00:41:06,857 --> 00:41:08,027
(Bring it.)

1151
00:41:08,597 --> 00:41:11,367
Hey. You were dying to do this.

1152
00:41:12,197 --> 00:41:13,566
That's enough. You can stop now.

1153
00:41:13,567 --> 00:41:15,306
(I want a bite for free!)

1154
00:41:15,307 --> 00:41:17,437
- He wanted to do that. - He's so good at it.

1155
00:41:17,607 --> 00:41:19,437
That wasn't a penalty but a show-and-tell.

1156
00:41:19,637 --> 00:41:22,047
He was born looking cheeky.

1157
00:41:22,777 --> 00:41:24,206
His opponent...

1158
00:41:24,207 --> 00:41:25,516
must've been annoyed.

1159
00:41:25,517 --> 00:41:26,747
(Am I winding you up?)

1160
00:41:27,117 --> 00:41:29,486
(Dong Hyun teases others with his every move.)

1161
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,516
(Laughing)

1162
00:41:30,517 --> 00:41:33,857
His opponent must've wanted to take a cheap shot at him.

1163
00:41:34,957 --> 00:41:36,456
That's what I did before the fight...

1164
00:41:36,457 --> 00:41:38,086
to look like a formidable warrior,

1165
00:41:38,087 --> 00:41:39,156
only to end up clinging to my opponents.

1166
00:41:39,157 --> 00:41:41,667
(Clinging like a cicada)

1167
00:41:41,767 --> 00:41:42,897
- Then... - Go ahead.

1168
00:41:43,097 --> 00:41:44,997
- You earned it. - It's hot.

1169
00:41:47,897 --> 00:41:49,836
(Bliss)

1170
00:41:49,837 --> 00:41:51,507
How is the rice? Talk to me.

1171
00:41:51,607 --> 00:41:54,407
First of all, this has a lot of dried radish greens.

1172
00:41:54,607 --> 00:41:55,947
I can smell them.

1173
00:41:56,107 --> 00:41:57,706
Normally, you'd only taste the seasoning.

1174
00:41:57,707 --> 00:41:59,346
- You're right. - The smell is strong.

1175
00:41:59,347 --> 00:42:00,776
Don't you get why I added the chilies?

1176
00:42:00,777 --> 00:42:02,187
The chilies balance it out.

1177
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:04,586
- And it's not that spicy. - What did I tell you?

1178
00:42:04,587 --> 00:42:05,916
- It's good. - I had it all.

1179
00:42:05,917 --> 00:42:07,316
The chilies balance it out.

1180
00:42:07,317 --> 00:42:10,587
(Even the expert approves of Yi Kyung's stir-fried rice.)

1181
00:42:12,257 --> 00:42:16,067
(Daniel also tries a mouthful.)

1182
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:20,696
The chunks of radish kimchi are the kicker.

1183
00:42:20,697 --> 00:42:21,707
Right?

1184
00:42:21,937 --> 00:42:23,466
The chunks of radish kimchi are delicious.

1185
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:25,477
(Expressing the taste by copying Daniel's words)

1186
00:42:25,977 --> 00:42:26,977
It's really good.

1187
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:28,938
The stir-fried rice is the highlight of the dish.

1188
00:42:29,077 --> 00:42:30,446
I wouldn't mind...

1189
00:42:30,447 --> 00:42:33,376
riding something at Lotte World and enjoying an ice cream.

1190
00:42:33,377 --> 00:42:34,846
(Since they're in Jamsil, Tae Hyun wants to go to an amusement park.)

1191
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:37,146
Tae Hyun wants to go to the amusement park.

1192
00:42:37,147 --> 00:42:38,617
I can't ride the Atlantis,

1193
00:42:38,817 --> 00:42:40,056
but I can get on the Gyro Drop.

1194
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,727
You're free to experience the Dong Hyun Choke.

1195
00:42:45,057 --> 00:42:46,327
The Dong Hyun Choke.

1196
00:42:46,757 --> 00:42:48,057
You won't die.

1197
00:42:48,257 --> 00:42:49,427
You'll get to breathe.

1198
00:42:49,697 --> 00:42:51,596
Can't you bring people back to life if they die?

1199
00:42:51,597 --> 00:42:53,197
They can get up if I lift up their feet.

1200
00:42:53,437 --> 00:42:55,506
- One goes into shock... - There's a scientific reason.

1201
00:42:55,507 --> 00:42:57,306
Because of the lack of blood flow to the brain.

1202
00:42:57,307 --> 00:42:59,136
By lifting up their legs, blood goes back to the head...

1203
00:42:59,137 --> 00:43:00,576
allowing them to wake up.

1204
00:43:00,577 --> 00:43:02,183
Do you feel refreshed, like waking up from sleep?

1205
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:04,276
You don't remember what happened.

1206
00:43:04,277 --> 00:43:05,776
- Do you feel refreshed? - Hold on.

1207
00:43:05,777 --> 00:43:07,076
- I'll explain in detail. - Sure.

1208
00:43:07,077 --> 00:43:09,946
Your vision blurs as the noise grows louder.

1209
00:43:09,947 --> 00:43:11,427
You see your opponent running around.

1210
00:43:12,457 --> 00:43:13,556
(Did he experience it and not someone else?)

1211
00:43:13,557 --> 00:43:15,356
Don't make it sound like you experienced it.

1212
00:43:15,357 --> 00:43:17,057
Hold on. Why is he running around?

1213
00:43:18,497 --> 00:43:19,757
We have a match today.

1214
00:43:20,727 --> 00:43:23,008
How many days are left until our match? Wait, it's today!

1215
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,336
Hold on. Time out.

1216
00:43:25,337 --> 00:43:26,796
(Where am I? Who am I?)

1217
00:43:26,797 --> 00:43:28,667
The referee is there comforting you.

1218
00:43:29,137 --> 00:43:31,236
- The referee? - We don't speak the same language.

1219
00:43:31,237 --> 00:43:32,976
Fighters look like they're confronting the referees,

1220
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,706
but it's because they don't remember anything.

1221
00:43:34,707 --> 00:43:36,453
(They now understand how it feels to be knocked out.)

1222
00:43:36,477 --> 00:43:38,716
- Anyway, we had gamjatang. - Sure.

1223
00:43:38,717 --> 00:43:40,153
- We should do what's necessary. - Right.

1224
00:43:40,177 --> 00:43:42,086
- You need to get this right. - Got it.

1225
00:43:42,087 --> 00:43:44,217
- You might end up paying again. - Fine.

1226
00:43:44,517 --> 00:43:45,517
Please get it right.

1227
00:43:45,657 --> 00:43:48,387
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

1228
00:43:48,657 --> 00:43:50,486
Pork has long been regarded...

1229
00:43:50,487 --> 00:43:53,656
as a symbol of fertility and wealth.

1230
00:43:53,657 --> 00:43:56,496
People started believing that seeing a pig in a dream...

1231
00:43:56,497 --> 00:43:58,057
meant they should buy a lottery ticket.

1232
00:43:58,197 --> 00:44:00,336
Why are pigs in dreams often interpreted...

1233
00:44:00,337 --> 00:44:02,467
as a symbol of fortune?

1234
00:44:04,237 --> 00:44:05,637
Which country are we talking about?

1235
00:44:06,307 --> 00:44:08,336
- Our country. - What?

1236
00:44:08,337 --> 00:44:09,446
- Our country. - Our country.

1237
00:44:09,447 --> 00:44:11,206
The Republic of Korea, of course.

1238
00:44:11,207 --> 00:44:12,276
It has to be, right?

1239
00:44:12,277 --> 00:44:14,416
- Every country... - You're right.

1240
00:44:14,417 --> 00:44:15,986
Has its own customs.

1241
00:44:15,987 --> 00:44:17,746
- Don't you know what I mean? - I totally get it.

1242
00:44:17,747 --> 00:44:20,916
- Didn't you get it? - This is why.

1243
00:44:20,917 --> 00:44:23,586
They don't believe that in China or other countries.

1244
00:44:23,587 --> 00:44:26,156
Exactly. The reason could be different for, say, Egypt.

1245
00:44:26,157 --> 00:44:28,196
- That could be a clue. - It most certainly can be.

1246
00:44:28,197 --> 00:44:29,373
Is that only believed in Korea?

1247
00:44:29,397 --> 00:44:31,267
- I'm talking about Korea. - Not China.

1248
00:44:31,727 --> 00:44:34,237
- That was a superb question. - Right?

1249
00:44:34,667 --> 00:44:36,536
Can I guess the correct answer,

1250
00:44:36,537 --> 00:44:37,537
or should I take a break?

1251
00:44:37,538 --> 00:44:39,136
- We're a team. - Are we a team?

1252
00:44:39,137 --> 00:44:40,777
(Get a grip on yourself, Daniel.)

1253
00:44:41,237 --> 00:44:42,747
You're killing me.

1254
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:45,776
Weren't we competing against each other earlier?

1255
00:44:45,777 --> 00:44:47,346
- That was to win a bite. - Hold on.

1256
00:44:47,347 --> 00:44:48,786
Did I happen to knock you out?

1257
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:49,916
(Experiencing the choke)

1258
00:44:49,917 --> 00:44:52,556
You saw how the game was played when we played it...

1259
00:44:52,557 --> 00:44:55,487
- at the Thai restaurant. - We still have to explain the rule.

1260
00:44:55,627 --> 00:44:56,627
(Yes, of course.)
I remember now.

1261
00:44:57,628 --> 00:44:59,126
- What do you think the answer is? - Me?

1262
00:44:59,127 --> 00:45:00,396
I think it's this.

1263
00:45:00,397 --> 00:45:02,596
Keeping and raising livestock...

1264
00:45:02,597 --> 00:45:05,366
requires enough food to feed them properly.

1265
00:45:05,367 --> 00:45:07,196
Wealthy families likely raised pigs,

1266
00:45:07,197 --> 00:45:09,007
which is why they became a symbol of wealth.

1267
00:45:10,437 --> 00:45:12,236
I think I know what it is. Hear me out,

1268
00:45:12,237 --> 00:45:13,717
- and tell me what you think. - Sure.

1269
00:45:15,447 --> 00:45:17,847
The Chinese character for pig is "don" which means money.

1270
00:45:18,377 --> 00:45:20,516
- Right? - That actually makes sense.

1271
00:45:20,517 --> 00:45:22,516
I'm betting my money on Dong Hyun's answer.

1272
00:45:22,517 --> 00:45:24,846
- Really? Tae Hyun too? - This is what worries me, though.

1273
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,416
If what Dong Hyun said is the correct answer,

1274
00:45:27,417 --> 00:45:29,486
he won't let Daniel hear the end of it.

1275
00:45:29,487 --> 00:45:30,586
- I see. - I know it for sure.

1276
00:45:30,587 --> 00:45:31,587
There's no doubt.

1277
00:45:31,657 --> 00:45:32,727
I have to brag about it.

1278
00:45:33,027 --> 00:45:34,596
It's the reason he does this.

1279
00:45:34,597 --> 00:45:35,896
- "Ong-Bak." - I won.

1280
00:45:35,897 --> 00:45:37,926
- It means I've won. - What?

1281
00:45:37,927 --> 00:45:39,296
He said his IQ was...

1282
00:45:39,297 --> 00:45:40,637
- between 135 and 140. - Hold on.

1283
00:45:40,767 --> 00:45:42,336
Does his answer make sense?

1284
00:45:42,337 --> 00:45:43,406
In my opinion, it does.

1285
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,467
- Really? - Yes.

1286
00:45:45,007 --> 00:45:46,207
- Is that so? - I'm confident.

1287
00:45:46,277 --> 00:45:47,736
I'm just going to follow Daniel...

1288
00:45:47,737 --> 00:45:49,606
because I'm confident about a 1-on-1 match.

1289
00:45:49,607 --> 00:45:50,706
- Okay. - Okay.

1290
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:52,307
You say, "I got it," and say the answer.

1291
00:45:52,347 --> 00:45:53,517
- I got it. - Okay.

1292
00:45:54,347 --> 00:45:55,493
I don't know what his answer is.

1293
00:45:55,517 --> 00:45:56,647
Pigs...

1294
00:45:58,187 --> 00:45:59,787
were raised only in the royal palace.

1295
00:45:59,857 --> 00:46:01,016
Wait. No.

1296
00:46:01,017 --> 00:46:02,427
(Wait!)

1297
00:46:03,557 --> 00:46:05,497
- I just can't let it pass. - No?

1298
00:46:05,557 --> 00:46:07,357
- I just can't let it pass. - No?

1299
00:46:07,497 --> 00:46:09,027
I've never seen one in the palace.

1300
00:46:09,527 --> 00:46:11,726
- Seriously. - Isn't it the symbol of wealth?

1301
00:46:11,727 --> 00:46:13,597
(Embarrassed)

1302
00:46:13,697 --> 00:46:15,866
- What would it be? - I won't stop you, so go ahead.

1303
00:46:15,867 --> 00:46:16,967
- I got it. - Okay.

1304
00:46:17,337 --> 00:46:20,636
Because they served pork during the ancestral rites,

1305
00:46:20,637 --> 00:46:22,476
a pig in a dream is interpreted as wealth.

1306
00:46:22,477 --> 00:46:24,453
It can be right. It was used to celebrate ancestors.

1307
00:46:24,477 --> 00:46:25,576
I'm 20,000 percent sure that he's wrong.

1308
00:46:25,577 --> 00:46:28,276
(It was interpreted as wealth...)

1309
00:46:28,277 --> 00:46:31,046
(because it was served for the ancestral rites.)

1310
00:46:31,047 --> 00:46:32,256
It's incorrect.

1311
00:46:32,257 --> 00:46:33,916
Gosh. What?

1312
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:35,056
Why are you disappointed?

1313
00:46:35,057 --> 00:46:36,856
When he said, "It's..."

1314
00:46:36,857 --> 00:46:38,656
I thought I was correct.

1315
00:46:38,657 --> 00:46:40,196
- It's so hard. - What's Dong Hyun's answer?

1316
00:46:40,197 --> 00:46:42,126
- Right. - I might be wrong,

1317
00:46:42,127 --> 00:46:43,496
but since it's believed only in Korea...

1318
00:46:43,497 --> 00:46:45,066
The Chinese character for pig is "don."

1319
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:47,166
And simply, "don" means money in Korean.

1320
00:46:47,167 --> 00:46:48,666
- That makes sense. - Its Chinese character is "don."

1321
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,266
I thought that was why we put money...

1322
00:46:50,267 --> 00:46:51,836
- in a pig's nostrils. - He said that.

1323
00:46:51,837 --> 00:46:53,006
- Correct. - What?

1324
00:46:53,007 --> 00:46:54,553
- It's correct, right? - Is it correct?

1325
00:46:54,577 --> 00:46:56,306
- Is it correct? - Come on. Seriously?

1326
00:46:56,307 --> 00:46:58,407
- I was correct. - It's the Chinese character "don."

1327
00:46:58,447 --> 00:47:00,516
I went too far back into the past.

1328
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:03,447
I could have thought it as modern and contemporary history.

1329
00:47:03,547 --> 00:47:06,556
Will you tell us when is the modern and contemporary period?

1330
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:08,086
Roughly speaking,

1331
00:47:08,087 --> 00:47:12,197
there was a film studio in Bucheon back in the day.

1332
00:47:12,497 --> 00:47:13,996
In Bucheon, they shot...

1333
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:14,997
(The days when it was wild.)

1334
00:47:14,998 --> 00:47:16,696
the one with Kim Du Han.

1335
00:47:16,697 --> 00:47:18,713
There was a set for "The Wild Days." That was when.

1336
00:47:18,737 --> 00:47:19,997
That was the modern period.

1337
00:47:20,067 --> 00:47:22,037
- You're right. - That was when.

1338
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:24,137
Now, do they go against each other?

1339
00:47:24,207 --> 00:47:25,407
Okay. It's a 1-on-1 match.

1340
00:47:25,437 --> 00:47:26,607
I'll finish it quickly.

1341
00:47:27,237 --> 00:47:30,007
The main ingredient of gamjatang is the pork spine.

1342
00:47:30,307 --> 00:47:32,216
Pork was often used for ancestral rites...

1343
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:34,047
and to host others,

1344
00:47:34,347 --> 00:47:36,417
so the royal palace took the role of raising them.

1345
00:47:36,747 --> 00:47:39,056
- I was correct. - You were correct.

1346
00:47:39,057 --> 00:47:40,333
- See? - It wasn't the answer, though.

1347
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:41,517
In that case,

1348
00:47:41,617 --> 00:47:44,586
what would be the current administrative department...

1349
00:47:44,587 --> 00:47:48,257
that used to be in charge of raising the pigs back then?

1350
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:50,927
- I got it. - Something like Administration?

1351
00:47:51,597 --> 00:47:53,466
- Ministry of Health and Welfare? - Incorrect.

1352
00:47:53,467 --> 00:47:56,007
- I got it. Ministry of Land? - Incorrect.

1353
00:47:56,037 --> 00:47:57,606
I got it. The Minister of Interior.

1354
00:47:57,607 --> 00:47:58,676
Incorrect.

1355
00:47:58,677 --> 00:48:00,776
- "Minister?" - It's a department.

1356
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,977
- Does the minister take care of it? - What was it?

1357
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:05,206
I'll get it wrong this time.

1358
00:48:05,207 --> 00:48:07,146
I don't know what ministries there are.

1359
00:48:07,147 --> 00:48:09,446
You can tell them how many words there are.

1360
00:48:09,447 --> 00:48:10,617
It's three words.

1361
00:48:10,687 --> 00:48:12,416
What? It's simple.

1362
00:48:12,417 --> 00:48:13,956
- Will you show us the answer? - So they can tell.

1363
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:15,726
- No. - You were right.

1364
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:16,763
- It'll be over... - What?

1365
00:48:16,787 --> 00:48:18,657
- once they know the abbreviation. - Will it?

1366
00:48:19,097 --> 00:48:20,796
- Ministry of Financial Accounting? - Incorrect.

1367
00:48:20,797 --> 00:48:22,266
- Hey. - Ministry of Financial Accounting.

1368
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:24,466
- Do you have no idea? - Ministry of Financial Accounting.

1369
00:48:24,467 --> 00:48:26,236
Surprisingly,

1370
00:48:26,237 --> 00:48:27,337
it has the same initials.

1371
00:48:28,807 --> 00:48:30,127
- I got it. - He gave you a clue.

1372
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,736
- I got it. - What is it?

1373
00:48:31,737 --> 00:48:33,706
- Okay. Nice work, everyone. - Yes.

1374
00:48:33,707 --> 00:48:35,076
- Good. - I got this one.

1375
00:48:35,077 --> 00:48:36,777
- Yes. - Say it.

1376
00:48:36,877 --> 00:48:38,076
Daniel, I'll pay for it.

1377
00:48:38,077 --> 00:48:39,476
- I'm sorry. - Okay.

1378
00:48:39,477 --> 00:48:40,776
- You have to pay for it. - Sure.

1379
00:48:40,777 --> 00:48:41,947
The tide has turned.

1380
00:48:42,087 --> 00:48:43,247
Ministry of Fund and Annuity.

1381
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,046
What is the Ministry of Fund and Annuity?

1382
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:46,517
I've never heard of it.

1383
00:48:46,557 --> 00:48:48,016
"Ministry of Fund and Annuity."

1384
00:48:48,017 --> 00:48:50,127
What is "Ministry of Fund and Annuity?"

1385
00:48:50,157 --> 00:48:51,256
What do they do...

1386
00:48:51,257 --> 00:48:52,673
- at Ministry of Fund and Annuity? - "Ministry of Fund and Annuity."

1387
00:48:52,697 --> 00:48:54,096
- Pension and all. - Do you mean NPS?

1388
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,396
- People's pension and... - I see.

1389
00:48:55,397 --> 00:48:57,466
- Okay. I'm an envoy from overseas. - Okay.

1390
00:48:57,467 --> 00:48:58,897
I'm here. I'll give you a clue.

1391
00:48:59,037 --> 00:49:00,236
- Hello. - Hello.

1392
00:49:00,237 --> 00:49:01,537
I'm American. Yes.

1393
00:49:01,967 --> 00:49:03,536
Now, we look at the camera and take a photo.

1394
00:49:03,537 --> 00:49:04,567
Yes.

1395
00:49:05,037 --> 00:49:06,436
Yes. Thank you. Are you Korean?

1396
00:49:06,437 --> 00:49:07,737
- Yes. - Good.

1397
00:49:07,777 --> 00:49:10,058
Do you speak English? Are you okay with speaking English?

1398
00:49:10,247 --> 00:49:11,876
- When you come to Korea next time, - Hey.

1399
00:49:11,877 --> 00:49:14,446
Let's have gamjatang together. Yes.

1400
00:49:14,447 --> 00:49:15,516
- Yes. - Yes.

1401
00:49:15,517 --> 00:49:17,016
I'll pay. Yes.

1402
00:49:17,017 --> 00:49:18,316
I got it. Darn it.

1403
00:49:18,317 --> 00:49:20,016
- Gosh. I got it now. - Goodness.

1404
00:49:20,017 --> 00:49:21,387
- Gosh. - I know it too.

1405
00:49:22,087 --> 00:49:23,833
If you get it wrong, then I'll get it right.

1406
00:49:23,857 --> 00:49:25,457
(It's super fun.)

1407
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:26,896
When you get it wrong, I'll get it right.

1408
00:49:26,897 --> 00:49:28,156
- Okay. - I know the answer.

1409
00:49:28,157 --> 00:49:30,326
After I write the answer down, will you say the answer?

1410
00:49:30,327 --> 00:49:32,136
- Okay. Let's do this. - I'm answering it first.

1411
00:49:32,137 --> 00:49:33,296
Okay. I'll turn around.

1412
00:49:33,297 --> 00:49:34,936
- I want to know what you'll say. - I'll turn around.

1413
00:49:34,937 --> 00:49:36,406
- Write it down. - He's lying.

1414
00:49:36,407 --> 00:49:37,666
(Ministry of Foreign Affairs)

1415
00:49:37,667 --> 00:49:39,407
I know the answer.

1416
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:41,137
- You can turn around now. - Okay.

1417
00:49:41,637 --> 00:49:43,376
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

1418
00:49:43,377 --> 00:49:44,906
- Ministry of Foreign Affairs. - I got it first.

1419
00:49:44,907 --> 00:49:46,816
(Sadly, Daniel fell a step behind.)

1420
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,916
Gosh. How could I get it 0.1 second later?

1421
00:49:48,917 --> 00:49:50,286
(Yi Kyung is exempted from paying again.)

1422
00:49:50,287 --> 00:49:53,117
When I thought of where an envoy is from,

1423
00:49:53,587 --> 00:49:55,057
I realized it was a foreign country.

1424
00:49:55,857 --> 00:49:57,057
Me too.

1425
00:49:57,357 --> 00:49:59,726
I could have never imagined that Ministry of Foreign Affairs...

1426
00:49:59,727 --> 00:50:01,196
would take care of the pigs.

1427
00:50:01,197 --> 00:50:03,196
That was how precious the pigs were.

1428
00:50:03,197 --> 00:50:04,726
The commoners couldn't raise them.

1429
00:50:04,727 --> 00:50:06,467
I was correct, then.

1430
00:50:07,067 --> 00:50:08,166
- What you said was right. - You had the facts.

1431
00:50:08,167 --> 00:50:09,706
- I got the facts right. - That was correct.

1432
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:10,966
- That's good. - I'm confident, then.

1433
00:50:10,967 --> 00:50:14,106
- I'm proud that I wasn't wrong. - What you said was correct.

1434
00:50:14,107 --> 00:50:15,806
I'll pay for this.

1435
00:50:15,807 --> 00:50:18,506
(Daniel pays for the food 2 consecutive times.)

- What else is here? - What would it be?

1444
00:50:32,127 --> 00:50:34,726
Actually, there is a beef tripe place...

1445
00:50:34,727 --> 00:50:35,727
Beef tripe.

1446
00:50:35,728 --> 00:50:37,397
That is famous nationwide.

1447
00:50:37,497 --> 00:50:39,343
It's the one where you grill the potatoes with it.

1448
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:41,197
- With the chilies too. - On the grill.

1449
00:50:41,337 --> 00:50:44,036
It's on the more expensive side.

1450
00:50:44,037 --> 00:50:45,136
- It is. - You're right.

1451
00:50:45,137 --> 00:50:46,206
In that case,

1452
00:50:46,207 --> 00:50:49,146
I'll recommend something that is as expensive.

1453
00:50:49,147 --> 00:50:51,006
- The Garak Market is in Jamsil. - Right.

1454
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:53,276
- That's right. - I go to the Garak Market...

1455
00:50:53,277 --> 00:50:54,716
very frequently.

1456
00:50:54,717 --> 00:50:56,447
The king crabs are in season right now.

1457
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:59,986
- They are sold at the market price. - You're right.

1458
00:50:59,987 --> 00:51:01,217
When we get excited,

1459
00:51:01,357 --> 00:51:02,926
it can cost more than the fine-dining restaurant.

1460
00:51:02,927 --> 00:51:04,226
- King crabs are really expensive. - I...

1461
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,227
Can we...

1462
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,426
just go to a sandwich place?

1463
00:51:06,427 --> 00:51:08,096
I think I'll pay for it again.

1464
00:51:08,097 --> 00:51:09,466
Gosh. Don't say that.

1465
00:51:09,467 --> 00:51:10,927

and king crabs in the Garak Market, we have to choose one.

1468
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:18,806
I'll choose jjajangmyeon.

1469
00:51:18,807 --> 00:51:19,977
(I'll choose jjajangmyeon.)

1470
00:51:20,807 --> 00:51:22,407
You have to choose between the two.

1471
00:51:22,607 --> 00:51:25,147
Either the beef tripe or the king crabs.

1472
00:51:25,847 --> 00:51:27,823
- Go for the beef tripe. - I'll choose the beef tripe.

1473
00:51:27,847 --> 00:51:29,546
It's been so long since I had it.

1474
00:51:29,547 --> 00:51:30,716
- I'll choose the beef tripe too. - The IQ of 150.

1475

I want to see you two as a team.

1478
00:51:35,757 --> 00:51:38,186

1483
00:51:47,697 --> 00:51:49,567
Please give me a receipt. Is this the receipt?

1484
00:51:49,607 --> 00:51:51,306

1486

- We're here to run Garak. - Exactly.

1496
00:52:22,467 --> 00:52:24,536
I've never come to this fish market before.

1497

- We can just follow him. - Gosh. Look at this place.

1501

When you think of the Garak Market,

1502
00:52:36,217 --> 00:52:37,886
- you think of the seafood. - Yes.

1503
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:39,087
They have meat too.

1504
00:52:39,357 --> 00:52:41,856

1510
00:52:50,897 --> 00:52:52,736
You buy the fish down there.

1511
00:52:52,737 --> 00:52:55,096
Then you come up here and pay for the table setting.

1512
00:52:55,097 --> 00:52:56,606
- You can eat here. - Yes. They set the table here.

1513
00:52:56,607 --> 00:52:58,807
You can have both meat and fish.

1514
00:52:59,337 --> 00:53:01,036

I've never seen one this big.

1539
00:53:52,597 --> 00:53:53,597
Gosh.

1540
00:53:54,027 --> 00:53:55,257
It's as tall as me, isn't it?

1541
00:53:56,267 --> 00:53:57,896
It's so... Gosh.

1542
00:53:57,897 --> 00:53:58,897
I thought it was a replica.

00:53:58,898 --> 00:54:00,697
How old is it to be this big?

1544
00:54:00,767 --> 00:54:03,407
- I assume it's about ten years old. - Gosh.

1545
00:54:03,437 --> 00:54:05,466
How much does it weigh?

1546
00:54:05,467 --> 00:54:07,677
- It's about 6kg. - About 6kg?

1547
00:54:07,937 --> 00:54:09,447
How much is it, then?

1548
00:54:09,707 --> 00:54:12,077
- It's 120 dollars per 1kg. - What?

1549
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:13,877
Please put it back.

1552
00:54:18,517 --> 00:54:20,757
- It's over 700 dollars. - It's about 760 dollars.

- What? - For one king crab.

1554
00:54:22,987 --> 00:54:25,027
- It's over 700 dollars? - Over 700 dollars?

1555
00:54:25,587 --> 00:54:26,956
- I told you. - It's more expensive...

1556
00:54:26,957 --> 00:54:28,373
than the fine-dining restaurant Seung Ho paid.

1557
00:54:28,397 --> 00:54:30,997
It easily exceeds the price of that restaurant.

1558
00:54:31,727 --> 00:54:32,996
- Usually... - What's that one?

1559
00:54:32,997 --> 00:54:34,766
- It's a red king crab. - Okay.

1560
00:54:34,767 --> 00:54:36,467
Usually, we get crabs that are this big.

1561
00:54:37,137 --> 00:54:39,707
- But that one is especially... - It even has a tag around it.

1562
00:54:39,777 --> 00:54:41,506
The king crabs with the label...

1563
00:54:41,507 --> 00:54:43,247
- are the tastiest ones. - Okay.

1564

If we were to have one,

1565
00:54:44,707 --> 00:54:45,946
shouldn't we have the king crabs?

1566
00:54:45,947 --> 00:54:47,616
But that one is over 700 dollars.

1567
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:49,517
- That... - Just get the quiz right.

1568
00:54:50,047 --> 00:54:52,687
We should go for the king, right?

1569
00:54:52,817 --> 00:54:55,386
For three people to fill themselves with food, what should we get?

1570
00:54:55,387 --> 00:54:57,226
- That one's too big for three. - That's too big.

1571
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:58,456
- It's for three people. - It's too big.

1572
00:54:58,457 --> 00:54:59,656
- Is this one all right? - Yes.

1573
00:54:59,657 --> 00:55:00,726
This one will be good.

1574
00:55:00,727 --> 00:55:01,896
- How much is that one? - How much is it?

1575
00:55:01,897 --> 00:55:03,466
It's also 120 dollars per 1kg.

1576
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:05,797
- Please weigh it for us. - I'll measure the weight.

1577
00:55:05,937 --> 00:55:07,796
- How heavy will it be? - I'll put it like this.

1578
00:55:07,797 --> 00:55:09,767
It's 2.2kg. It's 264 dollars.

1579
00:55:09,867 --> 00:55:12,366
- I see. It's 264 dollars. - Let's buy that one.

1580
00:55:12,367 --> 00:55:13,576
- This one? - Okay.

1581
00:55:13,577 --> 00:55:14,876
- We'll get that one and... - Yes.

1582
00:55:14,877 --> 00:55:16,206
- Do you have abalones? - We do.

1583
00:55:16,207 --> 00:55:17,506
- For abalones, - They have extra-large ones.

1584
00:55:17,507 --> 00:55:19,246
We want to add the butter you use for the shrimp.

1585
00:55:19,247 --> 00:55:21,046
- If you want to grill it in butter, - Yes.

1586
00:55:21,047 --> 00:55:22,176
I'll give them for free...

1587
00:55:22,177 --> 00:55:23,346
- since you're good-looking. - Thank you.

1588
00:55:23,347 --> 00:55:24,616
- I'm glad that you are. - It's crazy.

1589
00:55:24,617 --> 00:55:26,216
- Ma'am, we'll get the crab. - Yes.

1590
00:55:26,217 --> 00:55:28,187
With your love,

1591
00:55:28,517 --> 00:55:30,856
please get us some grilled abalones and shrimp in butter...

1592
00:55:30,857 --> 00:55:33,757
- as a compliment. - Yes. I'm giving you some...

1593
00:55:33,957 --> 00:55:35,297
- like this. - Goodness.

1594
00:55:35,497 --> 00:55:37,377
We can't help it because she's giving them all.

1595
00:55:37,927 --> 00:55:39,236
How much would that be in total?

1596
00:55:39,237 --> 00:55:41,196
- How much is it? - It's 264 dollars.

1597
00:55:41,197 --> 00:55:42,766
- It's 264 dollars. - Yes.

1598
00:55:42,767 --> 00:55:43,836
It's expensive.

1599
00:55:43,837 --> 00:55:44,966
You can go upstairs now.

1600
00:55:44,967 --> 00:55:46,076
- We'll guide you to the restaurant. - Shall we?

1601
00:55:46,077 --> 00:55:47,306
This is what we're getting.

1602
00:55:47,307 --> 00:55:48,976
- Please go upstairs. - Okay.

1603
00:55:48,977 --> 00:55:50,823
(They go up to the 3rd floor without worrying about paying.)

1604
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:53,377
It was a place to buy them, and this is the place to eat them.

1605
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,387
- They are separated. - There are many people.

1606
00:55:56,747 --> 00:55:58,786
I've never seen a king crab like that one.

1607
00:55:58,787 --> 00:56:00,286
- Me too. I've never seen one. - Me too.

1608
00:56:00,287 --> 00:56:03,157
How can one king crab be 70 dollars?

1609
00:56:03,857 --> 00:56:05,427
- Food is coming. - Is it?

1610
00:56:06,057 --> 00:56:07,297
- Gosh. - I love it too.

1611
00:56:07,657 --> 00:56:09,056
The side dishes I love.

1612
00:56:09,057 --> 00:56:10,226
What are you surprised at?

1613
00:56:10,227 --> 00:56:11,996
- This is the side dish I like. - The salad.

1614
00:56:11,997 --> 00:56:13,437
(Salad is love.)

1615
00:56:14,197 --> 00:56:15,497
(Surprised)

1616
00:56:15,737 --> 00:56:16,867
Is it seasoned skate?

1617
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:18,566
Skate?

1618
00:56:18,567 --> 00:56:19,577
(Clapping)

1619
00:56:19,837 --> 00:56:21,037
Thanks for the food.

1620
00:56:21,307 --> 00:56:24,047
My grandmother called this a seasoned skate.

1621
00:56:24,377 --> 00:56:27,476
(Taking a bite at the same time)

1622
00:56:27,477 --> 00:56:29,077
Does it taste good?

1623
00:56:29,147 --> 00:56:30,386
(Stamping their feet in sync)

1624
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:31,687
Does it have that pungent smell?

1625
00:56:32,387 --> 00:56:33,987
- No? - It doesn't smell like it at all.

1626
00:56:34,957 --> 00:56:36,157
It's sweet and sour.

1627
00:56:36,587 --> 00:56:37,587
Gosh. That sounds delicious.

1628
00:56:37,588 --> 00:56:38,857
Gosh. What should I do?

1629
00:56:39,297 --> 00:56:41,397
(Daniel is struggling already.)

1630
00:56:42,397 --> 00:56:43,566
It's coming.

1631
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:44,896
That's the butter-grilled ones.

1632
00:56:44,897 --> 00:56:45,966
(The free appetizer in a king's scale)

1633
00:56:45,967 --> 00:56:50,267
(Butter-grilled seafood)

1634
00:56:54,637 --> 00:56:57,107
I really wanted to have them.

1635
00:56:57,277 --> 00:56:58,347
That's right.

1636
00:57:00,647 --> 00:57:03,416
(They are covered in a buttery and smoky flavor.)

1637
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:05,186
Gosh. They look good.

1638
00:57:05,187 --> 00:57:06,816
(Seafood grilled in butter)

1639
00:57:06,817 --> 00:57:07,917
Gosh. This is...

1640
00:57:08,217 --> 00:57:09,577
- The abalone looks tasty. - Gosh.

1641
00:57:09,757 --> 00:57:12,156
- Gosh. When you have that, - Gosh.

1642
00:57:12,157 --> 00:57:13,197
(Golden abalones)

1643
00:57:14,457 --> 00:57:15,897
I'll have the fourth kid right away.

1644
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:18,866
- The abalones look good. - Exactly.

1645
00:57:18,867 --> 00:57:20,366
- Okay. - We have to eat the abalone first.

1646
00:57:20,367 --> 00:57:23,137
(The three start their feast for them to watch.)

1647
00:57:25,237 --> 00:57:26,377
Gosh. They look so good.

1648
00:57:28,607 --> 00:57:30,306
(Savoring)

1649
00:57:30,307 --> 00:57:32,547
- The abalones. - You'll be surprised by them.

1650
00:57:32,917 --> 00:57:34,077
The abalones taste so good.

1651
00:57:36,247 --> 00:57:37,247
It's so soft. Gosh.

1652
00:57:37,317 --> 00:57:38,637
- It's well-cooked, right? - Yes.

1653
00:57:38,747 --> 00:57:41,786
If you overcook it a little, it gets stiff.

1654
00:57:41,787 --> 00:57:42,787
You're right.

1655
00:57:43,127 --> 00:57:45,686
Gosh. They look so delicious. The clams look so good.

1656
00:57:45,687 --> 00:57:46,957
Are they scallops or clams?

1657
00:57:47,727 --> 00:57:49,397
(In that case, I'll try it.)

1658
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:52,366
(The buttery aroma explodes in his mouth.)

1659
00:57:52,367 --> 00:57:54,087
- The butter-grilled seafood. - It's tasty.

1660
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,017
- What are you going to eat? - You can have it.

1661
00:57:56,107 --> 00:57:57,206
Gosh. I love it.

1662
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:58,207
(It's unbearable.)

1663
00:57:58,367 --> 00:58:00,876
- Hey, try that one. - It's the biggest one.

1664
00:58:00,877 --> 00:58:02,877
- Tae Hyun should have the big one. - You have it.

1665
00:58:05,677 --> 00:58:07,516
(Amazed)

1666
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:09,116
- Gosh. - It has an amazing aroma, right?

1667
00:58:09,117 --> 00:58:10,316
(It has an amazing aroma, right?)

1668
00:58:10,317 --> 00:58:11,757
- Really? - Yi Kyung, have this one.

1669
00:58:12,017 --> 00:58:13,487
- Is it that good? - Goodness.

1670
00:58:14,117 --> 00:58:15,157
- Gosh. - So?

1671
00:58:16,557 --> 00:58:18,427
That looks so good. What should I do?

1672
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:20,796
It's definitely tasty because it was grilled in butter.

1673
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:22,227
It's tasty and flavorful.

1674
00:58:22,897 --> 00:58:24,703
- They are grilled to perfection. - I think they parboiled them.

1675
00:58:24,727 --> 00:58:26,137
It has an amazing texture.

1676
00:58:27,397 --> 00:58:28,666
- Goodness. - I ate because it was good.

1677
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:29,667
(And...)

1678
00:58:29,668 --> 00:58:31,566
(the king has arrived.)

1679
00:58:31,567 --> 00:58:33,737
- Thank you. - This is it.

1680
00:58:34,437 --> 00:58:35,506
(The king crab is prepared and steamed.)

1681
00:58:35,507 --> 00:58:37,067
- This is how it's served. - Thank you.

1682
00:58:38,607 --> 00:58:39,716
(King crab fried rice that one has to have)

1683
00:58:39,717 --> 00:58:41,747
This is the fried rice with real crab meat.

1684
00:58:46,617 --> 00:58:48,516
(After steaming the king crab, )

1685
00:58:48,517 --> 00:58:50,427
(they crack the shell and take out the meat.)

1686
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:57,427
(The shell is filled with crab meat.)

1687
00:59:01,097 --> 00:59:03,266
(How would you like it for dinner today?)

1688
00:59:03,267 --> 00:59:05,337
(King crab)

1689
00:59:05,807 --> 00:59:08,007
Gosh. It's served right away in a way it's easy to eat.

1690
00:59:09,207 --> 00:59:10,846
It's all prepared, so all we need to do is eat.

1691
00:59:10,847 --> 00:59:13,567
(One can have the steamed king crab right away as it's all trimmed.)

1692
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:17,716
(Sipping the juice of the king crab)

1693
00:59:17,717 --> 00:59:19,457
(Amazed)

1694
00:59:20,857 --> 00:59:22,977
The meat comes off right away when I crack the shell.

1695
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:25,357
Look at the meat.

1696
00:59:26,027 --> 00:59:28,557
- Everyone, look at this. - Gosh.

1697
00:59:28,897 --> 00:59:31,497
Usually, people hold it like this.

1698
00:59:33,967 --> 00:59:35,796
(Amazed)

1699
00:59:35,797 --> 00:59:36,806
Here we go.

1700
00:59:36,807 --> 00:59:38,287
- There's more meat inside. - Cheers.

1701
00:59:41,237 --> 00:59:42,237
Gosh.

1702
00:59:45,677 --> 00:59:46,717
Goodness. That's it.

1703
00:59:52,017 --> 00:59:53,186
(The endless eating show of the whole king crab meat)

1704
00:59:53,187 --> 00:59:54,257
Look at the crab meat.

1705
00:59:55,957 --> 00:59:57,027
Goodness.

1706
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:58,726
It's crazy.

1707
00:59:58,727 --> 00:59:59,856
- How does it taste? - Gosh.

1708
00:59:59,857 --> 01:00:00,857
(The frowning of the truth)

1709
01:00:00,858 --> 01:00:02,657
Gosh. The king crab is so... Gosh.

1710
01:00:02,997 --> 01:00:04,767
- It's crazy. - How does it taste?

1711
01:00:04,897 --> 01:00:07,197
It tastes like the crab...

1712
01:00:07,697 --> 01:00:09,467
we have at a fancy and expensive restaurant.

1713
01:00:09,837 --> 01:00:13,976
It's a very meaty crab. It's an amazing quality.

1714
01:00:13,977 --> 01:00:15,936
It has a crazy yield rate.

1715
01:00:15,937 --> 01:00:17,177
(It has a crazy yield rate.)

1716
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,346
(Chubby)

1717
01:00:19,347 --> 01:00:22,617
Is the king crab different from the snow crab we usually have?

1718
01:00:23,317 --> 01:00:26,686
Compared to the snow crabs, the chewiness of the meat...

1719
01:00:26,687 --> 01:00:28,787
- It's much chewier. - is very different.

1720
01:00:29,787 --> 01:00:32,856
The snow crabs are filled with meat too,

1721
01:00:32,857 --> 01:00:36,596
but you have to scrape it when you have it.

1722
01:00:36,597 --> 01:00:37,996
But you don't have to do that for this one...

1723
01:00:37,997 --> 01:00:39,436
because it has so much meat.

1724
01:00:39,437 --> 01:00:40,467
It's so tasty, right?

1725
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:42,267
You got the big chunk.

1726
01:00:43,767 --> 01:00:45,636
Come to think of it...

1727
01:00:45,637 --> 01:00:47,007
after eating it for a while,

1728
01:00:47,937 --> 01:00:49,376
- the quantity isn't enough. - I told you.

1729
01:00:49,377 --> 01:00:50,606
It's for one person.

1730
01:00:50,607 --> 01:00:52,676
Tae Hyun, I told you to get the 700-dollar one.

1731
01:00:52,677 --> 01:00:55,576
I didn't know it would shrink like this.

1732
01:00:55,577 --> 01:00:58,017
Come on. It didn't shrink.

1733
01:00:58,217 --> 01:00:59,886
Is it the same size we had?

1734
01:00:59,887 --> 01:01:02,056
I know. I thought it was huge, but after cooking it...

1735
01:01:02,057 --> 01:01:03,337
(That is called the yield rate.)

1736
01:01:03,387 --> 01:01:05,486
To eat the king crab,

1737
01:01:05,487 --> 01:01:07,527
I can imitate the character from "Ong-Bak" and all.

1738
01:01:07,897 --> 01:01:09,127
- You two. - Yes?

1739
01:01:09,357 --> 01:01:10,896
The one with a better two-line acrostic poem with abalone,

1740
01:01:10,897 --> 01:01:11,977
I'll give you some of this.

1741
01:01:12,197 --> 01:01:13,366
- A two-line acrostic poem? - Yes. You can go first.

1742
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:14,106
- I... - Okay. A...

1743
01:01:14,307 --> 01:01:15,547
- You two. - Yes?

1744
01:01:15,807 --> 01:01:17,346
The one with a better two-line acrostic poem with abalone,

1745
01:01:17,347 --> 01:01:18,427
I'll give you some of this.

1746
01:01:18,577 --> 01:01:19,746
- A two-line acrostic poem? - Yes. You can go first.

1747
01:01:19,747 --> 01:01:20,817
- I... - Okay. A...

1748
01:01:20,917 --> 01:01:23,156
- I'm... - It starts with "A."

1749
01:01:23,157 --> 01:01:24,616
- Why did you say, "I?" - It's okay. It's about the energy.

1750
01:01:24,617 --> 01:01:25,716
- I'm... - Okay. "I'm..."

1751
01:01:25,717 --> 01:01:26,786
- I'm... - B!

1752
01:01:26,787 --> 01:01:27,927
- I'm... - B...

1753
01:01:28,687 --> 01:01:29,896
Bok Soon.

1754
01:01:29,897 --> 01:01:31,396
(I'm Bok Soon.)

1755
01:01:31,397 --> 01:01:32,527
Bok Soon?

1756
01:01:32,627 --> 01:01:33,697
You're so eliminated.

1757
01:01:34,497 --> 01:01:36,296
Okay. When he said, "I'm..." he had the energy.

1758
01:01:36,297 --> 01:01:38,036
But to follow that with "Bok Soon" was surprisingly disappointing.

1759
01:01:38,037 --> 01:01:39,466
What's wrong with Bok Soon?

1760
01:01:39,467 --> 01:01:40,806
Dong Hyun will show you...

1761
01:01:40,807 --> 01:01:42,007
how it's done.

1762
01:01:42,167 --> 01:01:43,236
Okay. A!

1763
01:01:43,237 --> 01:01:44,876
(A)

1764
01:01:44,877 --> 01:01:47,207
Actually, I'm...

1765
01:01:47,777 --> 01:01:49,677
Well...

1766
01:01:49,847 --> 01:01:51,176
- Eliminated. - Of king crabs,

1767
01:01:51,177 --> 01:01:52,886
- Okay. - Of the king crabs,

1768
01:01:52,887 --> 01:01:53,917
B!

1769
01:01:54,917 --> 01:01:56,417
Best part is the fried rice.

1770
01:01:56,557 --> 01:01:57,686
(That's not good enough.)

1771
01:01:57,687 --> 01:01:58,687
Here, Bok Soon.

1772
01:01:58,688 --> 01:02:00,687
(Here, Bok Soon.)

1773
01:02:01,257 --> 01:02:02,896
Gosh. I really want to have it.

1774
01:02:02,897 --> 01:02:04,733
(Bok Soon wins the battle of the two proud geniuses.)

1775
01:02:04,757 --> 01:02:06,397
- Gosh. It's so good. - It's good, right?

1776
01:02:06,467 --> 01:02:08,427
Bok Soon was better than the fried rice.

1777
01:02:09,227 --> 01:02:11,297
No wonder king crabs are expensive.

1778
01:02:11,697 --> 01:02:12,837
You're right. Look at this.

1779
01:02:16,937 --> 01:02:20,407
(They can't escape from the king crab's temptation.)

1780
01:02:21,647 --> 01:02:23,147
There's only one meaty leg left.

1781
01:02:25,317 --> 01:02:26,346
King crabs are amazing.

1782
01:02:26,347 --> 01:02:27,717
(The fierce temptation continues.)

1783
01:02:28,147 --> 01:02:30,157
I'll do it. You guys.

1784
01:02:32,057 --> 01:02:34,027
I'll do it. You guys.

1785
01:02:34,427 --> 01:02:35,686
(He's going crazy by showing off his talents.)

1786
01:02:35,687 --> 01:02:37,827
Even if you say you know how crabs taste...

1787
01:02:38,497 --> 01:02:39,997
(Cracking up)

1788
01:02:40,227 --> 01:02:41,527
I... I'm...

1789
01:02:41,727 --> 01:02:42,936
(Choi Bok Soon never stops.)

1790
01:02:42,937 --> 01:02:44,596
What was that? What are you doing?

1791
01:02:44,597 --> 01:02:45,666
(I'm...)

1792
01:02:45,667 --> 01:02:47,237
burning with anger.

1793
01:02:47,437 --> 01:02:48,766
(Because he wants it so badly.)

1794
01:02:48,767 --> 01:02:50,807
Do I win because he gets a negative point?

1795
01:02:50,937 --> 01:02:53,046
- I won because I stayed quiet. - Tae Hyun.

1796
01:02:53,047 --> 01:02:55,077
I'm impressed by Daniel's courage.

1797
01:02:55,207 --> 01:02:56,216
- It's amazing. - Yes.

1798
01:02:56,217 --> 01:02:57,523
- Yes. I did it out of the blue. - Yes.

1799
01:02:57,547 --> 01:02:59,686
- "Do you know how it tastes?" - He was so desperate.

1800
01:02:59,687 --> 01:03:01,716
I really want to try it.

1801
01:03:01,717 --> 01:03:02,747
(Desperate)

1802
01:03:02,917 --> 01:03:05,317
Gosh. I've never had a king crab before.

1803
01:03:05,817 --> 01:03:07,226
- Is there a quiz? - Is there?

1804
01:03:07,227 --> 01:03:08,286
(They're especially desperate for a freeloading chance.)

1805
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,226
- Do you want to guess a capital? - Sounds good.

1806
01:03:10,227 --> 01:03:11,227
- A capital. - Sounds good.

1807
01:03:11,228 --> 01:03:12,297
- A capital? - A capital.

1808
01:03:13,397 --> 01:03:14,397
- As in money? - A capital of a country.

1809
01:03:14,398 --> 01:03:15,497
A capital of a country.

1810
01:03:15,997 --> 01:03:17,996
(He's a bit clumsy.)

1811
01:03:17,997 --> 01:03:18,997
A country's capital.

1812
01:03:19,467 --> 01:03:22,506
(A quiz for the freeloaders)

1813
01:03:22,507 --> 01:03:24,107
- Please. - Germany.

1814
01:03:24,837 --> 01:03:26,136
- Berlin. - Correct.

1815
01:03:26,137 --> 01:03:27,647
(Daniel: 1, Dong Hyun: 0)

1816
01:03:27,847 --> 01:03:28,876
Taiwan.

1817
01:03:28,877 --> 01:03:30,147
- Taiwan? - Taipei.

1818
01:03:30,547 --> 01:03:31,646
- Correct. - It was correct.

1819
01:03:31,647 --> 01:03:33,247
(Daniel: 1, Dong Hyun: 1)

1820
01:03:33,847 --> 01:03:35,147
- Russia. - Russia?

1821
01:03:36,917 --> 01:03:38,417
I got it. Moscow.

1822
01:03:38,657 --> 01:03:39,686
Correct.

1823
01:03:39,687 --> 01:03:41,026
(Daniel: 2, Dong Hyun: 1)

1824
01:03:41,027 --> 01:03:42,087
- Greece. - Gosh.

1825
01:03:43,127 --> 01:03:44,357
- Wait. - Athens?

1826
01:03:44,997 --> 01:03:46,026
- Correct. - Gosh.

1827
01:03:46,027 --> 01:03:47,697
(Daniel: 2, Dong Hyun: 2)

1828
01:03:48,197 --> 01:03:50,296
- Dong Hyun, you... - I look different now, right?

1829
01:03:50,297 --> 01:03:52,036
- look different. - You are smarter than I thought.

1830
01:03:52,037 --> 01:03:53,066
It's crazy.

1831
01:03:53,067 --> 01:03:54,736
- You're smarter than I thought. - You're amazing.

1832
01:03:54,737 --> 01:03:56,106
- I thought you'd get Germany wrong. - Gosh.

1833
01:03:56,107 --> 01:03:57,806
- You're amazing. - I thought you'd get it wrong.

1834
01:03:57,807 --> 01:03:59,376
- I'd give you that. - They compliment each other.

1835
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,246
I thought you'd get Greece wrong right away.

1836
01:04:01,247 --> 01:04:02,276
It's a close match.

1837
01:04:02,277 --> 01:04:03,553
(After an unexpectedly close match...)

1838
01:04:03,577 --> 01:04:04,776
There's no more.

1839
01:04:04,777 --> 01:04:06,416
- Now, we just say the answer. - We'll just go for it.

1840
01:04:06,417 --> 01:04:07,546
If you get one wrong, it's over.

1841
01:04:07,547 --> 01:04:08,547
- The first one to answer wins. - If you get one wrong...

1842
01:04:08,548 --> 01:04:10,356
Say, "I got it," and you'll get the chance.

1843
01:04:10,357 --> 01:04:11,357
Egypt.

1844
01:04:11,917 --> 01:04:13,486
- I got it. - Okay.

1845
01:04:13,487 --> 01:04:14,586
- Cairo. - Correct.

1846
01:04:14,587 --> 01:04:17,127
(Egypt, Cairo)

1847
01:04:17,727 --> 01:04:18,727
(Surprisingly, he won easily.)
Your IQ is 140!

1848
01:04:20,267 --> 01:04:21,896
- We approve of it. - It's 140.

1849
01:04:21,897 --> 01:04:23,896
- Dong Hyun's IQ is 135. - Gosh. You're smart.

1850
01:04:23,897 --> 01:04:25,636
- Dong Hyun. - Cairo?

1851
01:04:25,637 --> 01:04:27,036
How can the capital of Egypt be Cairo?

1852
01:04:27,037 --> 01:04:28,206
Egypt's capital is Cairo.

1853
01:04:28,207 --> 01:04:29,777
Do you know how I know it?

1854
01:04:29,977 --> 01:04:32,776
I played the Blue Marble Game so many times in childhood.

1855
01:04:32,777 --> 01:04:33,777
(We only gave the questions people would know.)

1856
01:04:33,778 --> 01:04:35,077
I played that game often too.

1857
01:04:35,307 --> 01:04:36,416
Here you go.

1858
01:04:36,417 --> 01:04:37,446
(The winner gets a crab leg.)

1859
01:04:37,447 --> 01:04:39,347
- My goodness. - Look at this.

1860
01:04:42,447 --> 01:04:46,657
(He fought hard to eat king crab with a freeloading chance.)

1861
01:04:48,927 --> 01:04:50,356
(Impressed)

1862
01:04:50,357 --> 01:04:51,457
I hope it falls.

1863
01:04:52,727 --> 01:04:54,126
- It looks tasty, right? - It looks so tasty.

1864
01:04:54,127 --> 01:04:55,397
Dong Hyun looks disappointed.

1865
01:04:57,067 --> 01:04:59,396
- My goodness. - It'll be funny if it falls.

1866
01:04:59,397 --> 01:05:00,477
(It's time to be flippant.)

1867
01:05:02,667 --> 01:05:04,136
I hope it falls.

1868
01:05:04,137 --> 01:05:05,497
Would you shake it hard once more?

1869
01:05:07,007 --> 01:05:08,076
I hope it falls.

1870
01:05:08,077 --> 01:05:10,617
It doesn't fall.

1871
01:05:11,077 --> 01:05:12,947
I'll eat it now.

1872
01:05:13,187 --> 01:05:14,317
It'll taste amazing.

1873
01:05:15,587 --> 01:05:16,687
So that's how you eat it.

1874
01:05:18,187 --> 01:05:19,727
"Do you know the taste of crabs?"

1875
01:05:21,557 --> 01:05:23,127
"Do you know the taste of crabs?"

1876
01:05:27,027 --> 01:05:28,767
- It's so tasty. - Congratulations.

1877
01:05:29,027 --> 01:05:30,666
(Impressed)

1878
01:05:30,667 --> 01:05:32,337
- It's insane, right? - It's no joke.

1879
01:05:33,037 --> 01:05:35,937
(Jealous)

1880
01:05:39,377 --> 01:05:41,046
Dong Hyun.

1881
01:05:41,047 --> 01:05:43,317
(Dong Hyun, would you like this?)

1882
01:05:43,517 --> 01:05:46,716
I won't eat it. It isn't crabmeat. It's something else.

1883
01:05:46,717 --> 01:05:47,817
Don't you want it?

1884
01:05:48,387 --> 01:05:49,387
Don't you want it?

1885
01:05:50,787 --> 01:05:51,857
Don't you want it?

1886
01:05:55,557 --> 01:05:56,827
(I won't give it to you.)

1887
01:05:58,097 --> 01:06:00,497
Hey, you hurt my pride.

1888
01:06:00,697 --> 01:06:03,167
- You hurt my pride. - It was a joke.

1889
01:06:03,297 --> 01:06:04,437
Okay, Dong Hyun.

1890
01:06:04,737 --> 01:06:05,936
I'll give it to you...

1891
01:06:05,937 --> 01:06:07,136
- since we had a good match. - We had a good match indeed.

1892
01:06:07,137 --> 01:06:09,636
It was the match of the century.

1893
01:06:09,637 --> 01:06:11,237
- We were neck-and-neck. - That's right.

1894
01:06:12,037 --> 01:06:14,347
I'll accept that you have an IQ of 130...

1895
01:06:16,377 --> 01:06:19,147
(Dropping)

1896
01:06:24,857 --> 01:06:26,386
- It dropped. - It dropped.

1897
01:06:26,387 --> 01:06:27,426
(Ruined pride)

1898
01:06:27,427 --> 01:06:29,427
- It was a joke. - He's the most annoying person.

1899
01:06:33,397 --> 01:06:34,467
It was a joke.

1900
01:06:35,897 --> 01:06:38,097
The other piece didn't fall no matter what. This one...

1901
01:06:38,367 --> 01:06:40,007
fell when you moved slightly.

1902
01:06:40,667 --> 01:06:41,766
Dong Hyun, I'm sorry.

1903
01:06:41,767 --> 01:06:43,127
I really wanted to give it to you.

1904
01:06:44,507 --> 01:06:46,906
Dong Hyun, let's have a basic round.

1905
01:06:46,907 --> 01:06:48,706
I'll give this to the person who wins in rock-paper-scissors.

1906
01:06:48,707 --> 01:06:50,946
- Rock-paper-scissors? - Play rock-paper-scissors.

1907
01:06:50,947 --> 01:06:52,776
Is it rock-paper-scissors or minus one? Tell me that.

1908
01:06:52,777 --> 01:06:54,616
It's rock-paper-scissors. Minus one is nonsense.

1909
01:06:54,617 --> 01:06:59,016
Are we playing rock-paper-scissors with both hands or one hand?

1910
01:06:59,017 --> 01:07:00,426
- What are you talking about? - What are you talking about?

1911
01:07:00,427 --> 01:07:02,387
You play minus one with both hands, not one hand.

1912
01:07:02,957 --> 01:07:04,327
Both hands?

1913
01:07:04,457 --> 01:07:06,827
You play minus one with both hands.

1914
01:07:06,967 --> 01:07:08,396
How will you play minus one with one hand?

1915
01:07:08,397 --> 01:07:09,896
Is it rock-paper-scissors or mukjjibba?

1916
01:07:09,897 --> 01:07:11,436
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Is it rock-paper-scissors?

1917
01:07:11,437 --> 01:07:12,673
Just plain old rock-paper-scissors.

1918
01:07:12,697 --> 01:07:14,836
Shouldn't you let me have this bite?

1919
01:07:14,837 --> 01:07:17,006
Dong Hyun, I'll lose on purpose.

1920
01:07:17,007 --> 01:07:19,106
Lose on purpose. I'll play rock.

1921
01:07:19,107 --> 01:07:20,747
- Will you play rock? - Play scissors.

1922
01:07:21,207 --> 01:07:23,488
I'll hold my hand like this and play scissors right away.

1923
01:07:23,517 --> 01:07:25,177
- Okay? - I'll hold my hand like this.

1924
01:07:25,347 --> 01:07:26,747
- I'm a fighter. - Okay.

1925
01:07:28,147 --> 01:07:29,286
- Rock-paper... - A fighter.

1926
01:07:29,287 --> 01:07:30,893
- Loyalty! - Hold on. What about a fighter?

1927
01:07:30,917 --> 01:07:31,917
Loyalty!

1928
01:07:32,017 --> 01:07:33,326
I don't go back on my word. I have loyalty.

1929
01:07:33,327 --> 01:07:34,426
Okay.

1930
01:07:34,427 --> 01:07:37,496
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1931
01:07:37,497 --> 01:07:38,996
(Paper, scissors)

1932
01:07:38,997 --> 01:07:41,167
(Loyalty, rest in peace.)

1933
01:07:41,967 --> 01:07:43,797
(You punk!)

1934
01:07:45,767 --> 01:07:47,666
Use a choke.

1935
01:07:47,667 --> 01:07:48,707
I can't let this go.

1936
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:52,537
(How dare you test a fighter's loyalty?)

1937
01:07:53,977 --> 01:07:56,578
What I know for certain is that his IQ is lower than mine by ten.

1938
01:07:56,677 --> 01:07:58,446
I'm certain of it.

1939
01:07:58,447 --> 01:07:59,653
- Dong Hyun. - Seriously, you...

1940
01:07:59,677 --> 01:08:03,286
Seriously, he has an IQ of over 125 at the very least.

1941
01:08:03,287 --> 01:08:04,516
- His IQ is lower than mine by 10. - An IQ of over 125.

1942
01:08:04,517 --> 01:08:05,886
I know that for certain. My goodness.

1943
01:08:05,887 --> 01:08:09,957
(He receives a king-sized spoonful of the king crab.)

1944
01:08:11,397 --> 01:08:13,566
- Enjoy it. - Thank you. My goodness.

1945
01:08:13,567 --> 01:08:15,127
(Moved)

1946
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:17,167
I'm sorry.

1947
01:08:17,697 --> 01:08:18,737
I'm sorry.

1948
01:08:19,237 --> 01:08:21,307
(Swinging)

1949
01:08:21,607 --> 01:08:24,836
- Hey, this is expensive. - Okay.

1950
01:08:24,837 --> 01:08:25,937
- It's tasty. - Yes.

1951
01:08:26,577 --> 01:08:27,807
What a bite.

1952
01:08:30,117 --> 01:08:31,777
It's the best.

1953
01:08:32,347 --> 01:08:34,416
Did you put all of it in that spoonful?

1954
01:08:34,417 --> 01:08:35,417
There's more.

1955
01:08:36,247 --> 01:08:37,657
There's so much crabmeat.

1956
01:08:39,817 --> 01:08:41,127
The texture...

1957
01:08:41,357 --> 01:08:42,357
It's incredible, right?

1958
01:08:42,557 --> 01:08:44,057
The crabmeat is really firm, right?

1959
01:08:44,527 --> 01:08:46,356
- It's firm. - Seriously.

1960
01:08:46,357 --> 01:08:48,466
It isn't mushy. I can really feel the texture.

1961
01:08:48,467 --> 01:08:50,366
How is there so much crabmeat?

1962
01:08:50,367 --> 01:08:51,966
Having this bite after not eating at all...

1963
01:08:51,967 --> 01:08:53,466
(The experience is more blissful.)

1964
01:08:53,467 --> 01:08:55,336
Please give us the check.

1965
01:08:55,337 --> 01:08:56,366
(It's time for the check.)

1966
01:08:56,367 --> 01:08:57,606
- Let's see how much the total is. - I wonder how much it is.

1967
01:08:57,607 --> 01:08:59,176
Let's see. That's what I'm curious about.

1968
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:00,277
Is it 300 dollars?

1969
01:09:00,447 --> 01:09:02,076
The total is 323 dollars.

1970
01:09:02,077 --> 01:09:03,077
(Total: 323 dollars)

1971
01:09:03,078 --> 01:09:04,316
Daniel, it's 323 dollars.

1972
01:09:04,317 --> 01:09:06,347
Don't jinx me. Please stop telling me about it.

1973
01:09:07,117 --> 01:09:09,587
If I pay 300 dollars after eating one crab leg...

1974
01:09:10,217 --> 01:09:12,416
If I get picked again, I'll pay over 400 dollars in total.

1975
01:09:12,417 --> 01:09:14,126
(If I get picked again, I'll pay over 400 dollars in total.)

1976
01:09:14,127 --> 01:09:16,826
- It's expensive. - Here comes the king crab quiz.

1977
01:09:16,827 --> 01:09:18,527
Okay. Give us the question.

1978
01:09:19,557 --> 01:09:21,237
"Blue crab" is called "Kkotgae" in Korean.

1979
01:09:22,067 --> 01:09:23,697
"Kkot" doesn't come from "Flower,"

1980
01:09:23,897 --> 01:09:27,406
but "Headland," an end piece of land...

1981
01:09:27,407 --> 01:09:29,806
that stretches to the sea.

1982
01:09:29,807 --> 01:09:31,367
So it's supposed to be "Headland crab."

1983
01:09:31,577 --> 01:09:33,806
It got such a name...

1984
01:09:33,807 --> 01:09:36,647
because of the pointy ends of the blue crab's back.

1985
01:09:37,547 --> 01:09:38,617
In that case,

1986
01:09:39,247 --> 01:09:42,147
why is "Snow crab" called "Daegae" in Korean?

1987
01:09:42,347 --> 01:09:43,816
It's so easy.

1988
01:09:43,817 --> 01:09:46,297
It must be a trick question since "Big" is the obvious answer.

1989
01:09:46,517 --> 01:09:48,426
- Why do you say that it's easy? - I think I know.

1990
01:09:48,427 --> 01:09:50,433
What's the answer? Didn't you think that "Dae" meant "Big?"

1991
01:09:50,457 --> 01:09:52,526
- I bet you thought that. - No, I didn't.

1992
01:09:52,527 --> 01:09:53,667
- No? - No.

1993
01:09:54,197 --> 01:09:56,166
What does a snow crab look like?

1994
01:09:56,167 --> 01:09:57,197
It has long legs.

1995
01:09:57,397 --> 01:09:58,696
Yeongdeok snow crabs have long legs.

1996
01:09:58,697 --> 01:09:59,936
- Those are snow crabs. - Blue crabs...

1997
01:09:59,937 --> 01:10:01,266
There are different types of snow crabs.

1998
01:10:01,267 --> 01:10:02,666
Blue crabs have a pointy back.

1999
01:10:02,667 --> 01:10:04,936
- Bakdal snow crabs... - Snow crabs are big.

2000
01:10:04,937 --> 01:10:06,036
That's right.

2001
01:10:06,037 --> 01:10:09,307
Why is "Snow crab" called "Daegae?" What does "Dae" stand for?

2002
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:10,876
(Barking)

2003
01:10:10,877 --> 01:10:15,217
- Did we... - When we think of... Be quiet.

2004
01:10:15,517 --> 01:10:17,037
Did we have a large size of gamjatang?

2005
01:10:17,887 --> 01:10:20,256
Snow crabs aren't so big.

2006
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:22,386
(So "Dae" can't mean "Big!")

2007
01:10:22,387 --> 01:10:24,027
- You might be right. - I figured it out.

2008
01:10:24,257 --> 01:10:28,496
(After bickering nonstop, )

2009
01:10:28,497 --> 01:10:32,367
(the two proud geniuses become one.)

2010
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,297
- Seriously. - You might be right.

2011
01:10:35,267 --> 01:10:41,846
(Despite the two proud geniuses, Seung Ho focuses on the problem.)

2012
01:10:41,847 --> 01:10:43,146
All right. I figured it out.

2013
01:10:43,147 --> 01:10:44,546
- Okay. - Oh, no.

2014
01:10:44,547 --> 01:10:46,117
I think this is right.

2015
01:10:46,887 --> 01:10:49,046
- What? - Seung Ho, I'm nervous.

2016
01:10:49,047 --> 01:10:50,156
(Their flippant switch is on.)

2017
01:10:50,157 --> 01:10:53,056
- Seung Ho, I'm nervous. - "Kkot" in "Kkotgae" means...

2018
01:10:53,057 --> 01:10:54,286
Listen to what I have to say.

2019
01:10:54,287 --> 01:10:55,287
(Flippant)

2020
01:10:55,288 --> 01:10:56,956
- Okay. We lost. - All right.

2021
01:10:56,957 --> 01:10:58,796
Blue crab is "Kkotgae" in Korean...

2022
01:10:58,797 --> 01:11:00,596
because of "Got," which means "Headland."

2023
01:11:00,597 --> 01:11:03,867
- That's right. - Homigot and Ganjeolgot are...

2024
01:11:04,337 --> 01:11:05,567
in Pohang, right?

2025
01:11:05,697 --> 01:11:06,837
Which places end with "Dae?"

2026
01:11:07,237 --> 01:11:08,467
- Big. - In Gangneung.

2027
01:11:08,667 --> 01:11:09,936
- Gyeongpodae. - Seoul Institute of the Arts.

2028
01:11:09,937 --> 01:11:11,477
- Hajodae. - Chungang University.

2029
01:11:11,637 --> 01:11:12,877
Yonsei University.

2030
01:11:13,337 --> 01:11:14,576
(Gyeongpodae, Gangneung)

2031
01:11:14,577 --> 01:11:16,177
(Hajodae, Yangyang)

2032
01:11:16,377 --> 01:11:17,576
- There are such places. - You're right.

2033
01:11:17,577 --> 01:11:19,877
Now, please wrap up the information.

2034
01:11:20,347 --> 01:11:21,586
- Gyeongpodae. - That's all I can say.

2035
01:11:21,587 --> 01:11:22,946
(But wrapping up the information is your responsibility.)

2036
01:11:22,947 --> 01:11:24,456
- You think "Dae" comes from them. - Yes.

2037
01:11:24,457 --> 01:11:26,927
If "Got" is a headland, "Dae" must be a landform...

2038
01:11:27,127 --> 01:11:28,387
that's wider...

2039
01:11:28,887 --> 01:11:30,096
Which university did you go to?

2040
01:11:30,097 --> 01:11:32,073
- I'm a high school graduate. - A high school graduate?

2041
01:11:32,097 --> 01:11:33,667
I dropped out of Chungwoon University.

2042
01:11:33,767 --> 01:11:35,226
(He shares information about the university he attended.)

2043
01:11:35,227 --> 01:11:37,466
On the beach, you see...

2044
01:11:37,467 --> 01:11:38,497
A parasol.

2045
01:11:39,067 --> 01:11:41,206
- A landform that envelopes... - A hug?

2046
01:11:41,207 --> 01:11:43,706
If "Got" is an end piece of the land...

2047
01:11:43,707 --> 01:11:44,883
Hakikjeon or the Crane Wind Formation.

2048
01:11:44,907 --> 01:11:46,306
He called it "The Crane Wind Formation."

2049
01:11:46,307 --> 01:11:47,546
(The man with an IQ of 135 called it "The Crane Wind Formation.")

2050
01:11:47,547 --> 01:11:51,077
- It's "The Crane Wing Formation." - "The Crane Wing Formation."

2051
01:11:51,547 --> 01:11:53,647
Doesn't "Dae" come from "Cheeky?"

2052
01:11:53,887 --> 01:11:55,916
- It doesn't start with "Dae." - You're a genius.

2053
01:11:55,917 --> 01:11:57,386
- It doesn't work. - it starts with "Dwe."

2054
01:11:57,387 --> 01:12:00,056
- Really? - Your intention was good. "Cheeky."

2055
01:12:00,057 --> 01:12:01,687
(They keep disrupting the guess.)

2056
01:12:01,787 --> 01:12:03,827
Did "Tae," the word that means "Big," become "Dae?"

2057
01:12:03,857 --> 01:12:04,956
We're in trouble.

2058
01:12:04,957 --> 01:12:06,926
- Did "Taegae" become "Daegae?" - We're in trouble.

2059
01:12:06,927 --> 01:12:07,927
- They're nearly there. - That's...

2060
01:12:07,928 --> 01:12:09,426
- Yi Kyung is good. - He's really good.

2061
01:12:09,427 --> 01:12:10,596
- He's good. - He's a genius.

2062
01:12:10,597 --> 01:12:12,237
- He should join Mensa. - He's good.

2063
01:12:12,337 --> 01:12:14,566
He might have an IQ of over 140.

2064
01:12:14,567 --> 01:12:17,836
- He's good. - Five people are solving this.

2065
01:12:17,837 --> 01:12:20,007
If we give a plausible answer, they become very quiet.

2066
01:12:20,977 --> 01:12:22,846
If they think it's wrong, they go, "He should join Mensa."

2067
01:12:22,847 --> 01:12:24,367
But they don't know the answer anyway.

2068
01:12:24,477 --> 01:12:26,176
- They don't know the answer. - I think I know.

2069
01:12:26,177 --> 01:12:27,316
You aren't very trustworthy.

2070
01:12:27,317 --> 01:12:29,163
(The man who claims to be a genius isn't very trustworthy.)

2071
01:12:29,187 --> 01:12:31,657
Since "Got" became "Kkot," you must study "Dae" in depth.

2072
01:12:31,717 --> 01:12:33,886
It might be a variation of "Tae" as Yi Kyung said earlier.

2073
01:12:33,887 --> 01:12:35,287
Tae, Jeong, Tae, Se, Mun, Dan, Se.

2074
01:12:35,527 --> 01:12:37,027
Yeon Jung, Yon, Se...

2075
01:12:37,527 --> 01:12:41,097
(They make the most annoying pair.)

2076
01:12:42,067 --> 01:12:44,137
I didn't even think of that. I thought...

2077
01:12:44,537 --> 01:12:47,937
"Snow crab" was called "Daegae" due to its bigger size.

2078
01:12:48,337 --> 01:12:50,277
Gosh, that's the answer.

2079
01:12:51,737 --> 01:12:53,477
- We'll get the answer. - No, you won't.

2080
01:12:53,647 --> 01:12:54,706
We'll get the answer.

2081
01:12:54,707 --> 01:12:57,353
- We can't take too much time. - Is this the tripe restaurant? Yes.

2082
01:12:57,377 --> 01:12:58,876
(Hello.)

2083
01:12:58,877 --> 01:12:59,917
We'll be there soon.

2084
01:13:00,147 --> 01:13:02,086
- We just need to solve a question. - He does that every week.

2085
01:13:02,087 --> 01:13:04,557
We'll hurry up. Is the tripe on the grill? Okay.

2086
01:13:05,117 --> 01:13:06,186
The tripe is on the grill. It'll get burnt.

2087
01:13:06,187 --> 01:13:07,256
- We need to flip it over. - We need to go right away.

2088
01:13:07,257 --> 01:13:08,527
Please hurry up.

2089
01:13:08,887 --> 01:13:10,207
There has to be a characteristic.

2090
01:13:10,857 --> 01:13:14,596
Is it because its legs are thin and long like a bamboo?

2091
01:13:14,597 --> 01:13:15,796
Its legs are like a bamboo.

2092
01:13:15,797 --> 01:13:17,937
Its legs are thin and long like a bamboo.

2093
01:13:18,037 --> 01:13:19,267
That's the correct answer.

2094
01:13:19,837 --> 01:13:21,937
- It must mean "Bamboo." - "Dae" means "Bamboo."

2095
01:13:22,067 --> 01:13:23,106
Seriously.

2096
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:24,136
It means "Bamboo."

2097
01:13:24,137 --> 01:13:26,107
- Its legs are like a bamboo. - Snow crab legs...

2098
01:13:26,307 --> 01:13:28,146
look like this.

2099
01:13:28,147 --> 01:13:31,277
(They get a bad feeling.)

2100
01:13:32,517 --> 01:13:34,216
(It sounds plausible.)

2101
01:13:34,217 --> 01:13:35,777
I think it's correct. We're in trouble.

2102
01:13:36,487 --> 01:13:38,047
We're in trouble. I think it's correct.

2103
01:13:38,787 --> 01:13:40,627
The total is 320 dollars. We're in trouble.

2104
01:13:41,157 --> 01:13:43,756
- Why are you guys so loud? - We're set.

2105
01:13:43,757 --> 01:13:44,856
- Are you guys dating? - We're set.

2106
01:13:44,857 --> 01:13:46,026
It's too plausible.

2107
01:13:46,027 --> 01:13:47,096
We became speechless.

2108
01:13:47,097 --> 01:13:50,026
- Tae Hyun, bamboo looks like this. - That's right. That's it.

2109
01:13:50,027 --> 01:13:52,296
- That's right. I saw it somewhere. - It's correct.

2110
01:13:52,297 --> 01:13:53,536
When I look at it like this...

2111
01:13:53,537 --> 01:13:55,206
Why did I think about the land?

2112
01:13:55,207 --> 01:13:56,466
- Tae Hyun. - All right.

2113
01:13:56,467 --> 01:13:59,076
- Why would it be "Daegae?" - Okay, everyone.

2114
01:13:59,077 --> 01:14:01,347
- It's this big. - Be quiet.

2115
01:14:01,407 --> 01:14:03,507
Our answer will be "Bamboo."

2116
01:14:04,417 --> 01:14:05,447
Okay.

2117
01:14:06,147 --> 01:14:07,347
- So what? - What?

2118
01:14:07,417 --> 01:14:11,486
Would you think about it one more time?

2119
01:14:11,487 --> 01:14:13,216
- Consider a different answer. - A different answer.

2120
01:14:13,217 --> 01:14:16,026
- Hajodae and Gyeongpodae were nice. - They were nice.

2121
01:14:16,027 --> 01:14:17,696
- All right. Here we go. - Okay.

2122
01:14:17,697 --> 01:14:18,726
Say the answer right away.

2123
01:14:18,727 --> 01:14:19,956
- We'll give our answer. - Okay.

2124
01:14:19,957 --> 01:14:21,627
(They suddenly hear a bell.)

2125
01:14:21,827 --> 01:14:24,297
- It's correct. - Correct. Ding-dong.

2126
01:14:24,467 --> 01:14:26,936
- Time's up. - What would you like?

2127
01:14:26,937 --> 01:14:28,837
You guys ran out of time.

2128
01:14:29,737 --> 01:14:31,976
Will you guys trust me even if my answer is incorrect?

2129
01:14:31,977 --> 01:14:33,506
- Your answer is perfect. - Okay.

2130
01:14:33,507 --> 01:14:34,546
- All right. - It can't be wrong.

2131
01:14:34,547 --> 01:14:36,976
As long as you guys trust me, I don't care if it's wrong.

2132
01:14:36,977 --> 01:14:38,446
Let me answer. Bamboo.

2133
01:14:38,447 --> 01:14:39,546
All right.

2134
01:14:39,547 --> 01:14:41,386
(Answer: Bamboo)

2135
01:14:41,387 --> 01:14:43,817
- Your answer is "Bamboo." - The question was too easy.

2136
01:14:44,817 --> 01:14:46,017
It's nerve-racking.

2137
01:14:46,757 --> 01:14:47,887
The answer is...

2138
01:14:49,057 --> 01:14:50,186
- correct. - Yes.

2139
01:14:50,187 --> 01:14:51,456
(Answer: Bamboo)

2140
01:14:51,457 --> 01:14:52,773
- Seung Ho did all the work. - Yes.

2141
01:14:52,797 --> 01:14:54,166
- We won. - The question was too easy.

2142
01:14:54,167 --> 01:14:55,327
Thank you for your hard work.

2143
01:14:55,627 --> 01:14:58,636
(They need to take care of the check for the king crab.)

2144
01:14:58,637 --> 01:15:01,066
The question was too easy.

2145
01:15:01,067 --> 01:15:03,266
We should've eaten the one that was worth 700 dollars.

2146
01:15:03,267 --> 01:15:04,637
(Teasing)

2147
01:15:04,737 --> 01:15:06,237
We always regret it afterward.

2148
01:15:07,277 --> 01:15:08,806
It looks like we'll see the probability I talked about.

2149
01:15:08,807 --> 01:15:10,716
(Daniel will pay 3 or more times with 20,000 percent probability.)

2150
01:15:10,717 --> 01:15:12,216
You know,

2151
01:15:12,217 --> 01:15:14,387
Daniel paid the last two times without eating.

2152
01:15:14,547 --> 01:15:17,216
- I want to yield this time, but... - You should pay this time.

2153
01:15:17,217 --> 01:15:18,986
Will you lose on purpose? Dong Hyun,

2154
01:15:18,987 --> 01:15:20,727
will you pay or play a game?

2155
01:15:21,487 --> 01:15:22,557
Be cool.

2156
01:15:24,457 --> 01:15:27,326
Let's follow the rules for now.

2157
01:15:27,327 --> 01:15:28,627
Let's follow the rules.

2158
01:15:28,927 --> 01:15:30,666
- For the total is 323 dollars, - I can't pay 323 dollars...

2159
01:15:30,667 --> 01:15:32,396
after eating a small crab leg.

2160
01:15:32,397 --> 01:15:34,266
You'll have the following quiz.

2161
01:15:34,267 --> 01:15:38,136
A subway station that's located here in Jamsil, Jamsilsaenae Station,

2162
01:15:38,137 --> 01:15:40,907
had the old name of Sincheon Station.

2163
01:15:42,147 --> 01:15:45,046
- You know that. - I know that.

2164
01:15:45,047 --> 01:15:46,747
- We met there often. - I know that.

2165
01:15:47,347 --> 01:15:48,986
Until 2016,

2166
01:15:48,987 --> 01:15:51,917
Jamsilsaenae Station was called Sincheon Station.

2167
01:15:52,257 --> 01:15:55,827
But its name got switched due to the endless complaints.

2168
01:15:57,397 --> 01:15:59,297
What were the complaints?

2169
01:15:59,757 --> 01:16:00,827
Excuse me?

2170
01:16:01,767 --> 01:16:02,767
Excuse me?

2171
01:16:02,768 --> 01:16:05,236
Hold on a second. Time out.

2172
01:16:05,237 --> 01:16:06,696
Why did we get an essay question?

2173
01:16:06,697 --> 01:16:08,406
They got a short answer question.

2174
01:16:08,407 --> 01:16:10,106
- Why did we get an essay question? - This is a short answer question.

2175
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:11,107
Just be the one to answer first.

2176
01:16:11,108 --> 01:16:14,406
But we need to list the complaints...

2177
01:16:14,407 --> 01:16:16,346
- people made. - Just give the reason.

2178
01:16:16,347 --> 01:16:18,676
- No, it's just 1. - It's just 1. Many people made...

2179
01:16:18,677 --> 01:16:19,916
- the same complaint. - Is it a word?

2180
01:16:19,917 --> 01:16:21,346
- It isn't a word. - It isn't a word.

2181
01:16:21,347 --> 01:16:23,617
- Just give the situation. - We got an essay question.

2182
01:16:24,857 --> 01:16:26,316
I'll let you give the first answer.

2183
01:16:26,317 --> 01:16:28,857
(He lets Daniel go first since he looks so victimized.)

2184
01:16:37,637 --> 01:16:40,407
(There's strange tension between the two men.)

2185
01:16:40,507 --> 01:16:42,507
- Just give any answer. - I know.

2186
01:16:43,007 --> 01:16:44,136
The one who loses will pay.

2187
01:16:44,137 --> 01:16:45,307
- Let me answer. - Okay.

2188
01:16:45,777 --> 01:16:47,406
- There's the Sinchon Station. - Yes.

2189
01:16:47,407 --> 01:16:48,976
People got confused...

2190
01:16:48,977 --> 01:16:50,823
- since they were both on Line Two. - That's right.

2191
01:16:50,847 --> 01:16:52,716
"We're at the Sincheon Station."

2192
01:16:52,717 --> 01:16:54,146
Then people kept going to the Sinchon Station.

2193
01:16:54,147 --> 01:16:55,846
- The names were too similar. - It happened all the time.

2194
01:16:55,847 --> 01:16:57,616
- It was confusing. - I did that when I was younger.

2195
01:16:57,617 --> 01:16:59,216
- People heard Sincheon as Sinchon. - I got confused.

2196
01:16:59,217 --> 01:17:00,527
People got confused...

2197
01:17:01,327 --> 01:17:04,527
and said, "Please change the name since it's too similar."

2198
01:17:04,827 --> 01:17:06,027
That's what I think.

2199
01:17:06,497 --> 01:17:08,017
So people confused Sincheon Station...

2200
01:17:08,297 --> 01:17:10,867
- with Sinchon Station. - The name was too similar.

2201
01:17:11,037 --> 01:17:12,496
My name used to be Kim Bong.

2202
01:17:12,497 --> 01:17:14,106
When people asked me for my name and I said, "Kim Bong,"

2203
01:17:14,107 --> 01:17:16,107
they wrote, "Kim Bong Hee."

2204
01:17:16,737 --> 01:17:18,537
- Is Kim Dong Hyun a changed name? - Hey!

2205
01:17:18,637 --> 01:17:20,517
"I'm a bong or a pushover." Was that your name?

2206
01:17:20,547 --> 01:17:22,146
"I'm a bong or a pushover." Was that your name?

2207
01:17:22,147 --> 01:17:24,107
I got teased so much because of that catchphrase.

2208
01:17:24,447 --> 01:17:26,353
Kids grabbed me and said, "I caught a pushover."

2209
01:17:26,377 --> 01:17:27,786
- It continued until middle school. - Was it really Bong?

2210
01:17:27,787 --> 01:17:29,786
Since Sincheon Station was a confusing name...

2211
01:17:29,787 --> 01:17:32,347
that had to be repeated many times, people asked for a new name.

2212
01:17:33,287 --> 01:17:34,557
Is it too obvious?

2213
01:17:34,657 --> 01:17:35,826
Correct.

2214
01:17:35,827 --> 01:17:37,096
(Correct?)

2215
01:17:37,097 --> 01:17:38,226
Correct.

2216
01:17:38,227 --> 01:17:39,896
(Correct?)

2217
01:17:39,897 --> 01:17:41,067
Is it correct?

2218
01:17:41,397 --> 01:17:42,526
- What? - Is it correct?

2219
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,067
- Is it correct? - Yes.

2220
01:17:44,297 --> 01:17:45,397
What?

2221
01:17:45,967 --> 01:17:47,507
What?

2222
01:17:48,007 --> 01:17:49,366
What?

2223
01:17:49,367 --> 01:17:52,177
Hold on. What?

2224
01:17:52,207 --> 01:17:53,676
What? Are you serious?

2225
01:17:53,677 --> 01:17:54,677
(Since Dong Hyun is correct, Daniel will pay again.)
Hold on a second.

2226
01:17:55,678 --> 01:17:57,046
It was such an easy question.

2227
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:58,377
(What are we going to do?)

2228
01:17:58,417 --> 01:17:59,676
Hold on a second.

2229
01:17:59,677 --> 01:18:00,816
(The happy Ong-Bak ceremony)

2230
01:18:00,817 --> 01:18:02,547
Hold on a second.

2231
01:18:02,917 --> 01:18:04,416
- No. - All right.

2232
01:18:04,417 --> 01:18:05,886
- I mean... - All right.

2233
01:18:05,887 --> 01:18:07,656
- Muay Thai. - I mean...

2234
01:18:07,657 --> 01:18:08,956
(The king of flippancy)

2235
01:18:08,957 --> 01:18:10,656
- Hold on a second. - Yes.

2236
01:18:10,657 --> 01:18:13,097
All right.

2237
01:18:13,827 --> 01:18:15,967
Seriously. What are we going to do?

2238
01:18:16,227 --> 01:18:17,467
- Are you okay? - I'm good.

2239
01:18:17,997 --> 01:18:19,197
Not good, to be honest.

2240
01:18:19,337 --> 01:18:20,537
But...

2241
01:18:20,637 --> 01:18:22,106
it can't be helped.

2242
01:18:22,107 --> 01:18:24,637
I thought that I'd be wrong. But my answer was correct.

2243
01:18:25,107 --> 01:18:26,537
Daniel, think about this.

2244
01:18:26,637 --> 01:18:28,947
Perhaps the entire day...

2245
01:18:29,047 --> 01:18:31,047
was a prank on you.

2246
01:18:31,147 --> 01:18:33,053
- It feels a bit that way. - Did you have that thought?

2247
01:18:33,077 --> 01:18:36,116
- Maybe I'll pay no matter what. - Seriously.

2248
01:18:36,117 --> 01:18:38,387
- "The Truman Show." - What if all of them are actors?

2249
01:18:39,117 --> 01:18:40,456
What if the cameras aren't rolling?

2250
01:18:40,457 --> 01:18:41,526
Seriously.

2251
01:18:41,527 --> 01:18:43,063
(The lead of "The Daniel Show" becomes nervous.)

2252
01:18:43,087 --> 01:18:44,426
Sir, I'll pay.

2253
01:18:44,427 --> 01:18:45,547
(He now pays like the lead.)

2254
01:18:47,727 --> 01:18:49,097
By any chance,

2255
01:18:49,527 --> 01:18:51,667
- is there a discount? - A discount.

2256
01:18:51,967 --> 01:18:53,736
- Well... - Instead of a discount,

2257
01:18:53,737 --> 01:18:56,637
- we gave many freebies. - Okay. I understand.

2258
01:18:56,667 --> 01:18:58,607
- I really enjoyed the food. - Thank you.

2259
01:18:59,007 --> 01:19:00,177
- Thank you. - All right.

2260
01:19:00,237 --> 01:19:01,446
- We'll get going now. - Okay.

2261
01:19:01,447 --> 01:19:02,747
(Daniel pays again.)

2262
01:19:02,977 --> 01:19:05,847
(Daniel wishes that the day is a lie.)

2263
01:19:12,517 --> 01:19:16,757
(In search of the second dinner menu)

2264
01:19:17,157 --> 01:19:20,256
(It's where people go after work.)

2265
01:19:20,257 --> 01:19:21,366
Is this the place?

2266
01:19:21,367 --> 01:19:22,527
Bangi Food Road.

2267
01:19:22,627 --> 01:19:25,467
This is where the restaurants are located. Bangi Food Road.

2268
01:19:26,967 --> 01:19:29,136
(It's the after-work haven for people who work in Jamsil.)

2269
01:19:29,137 --> 01:19:31,907
(Bangi Food Road)

2270
01:19:32,337 --> 01:19:37,347
(Fancy neon signs greet people who got off work.)

2271
01:19:37,947 --> 01:19:41,747
(They're seduced...)

2272
01:19:42,187 --> 01:19:48,227
(by various kinds of soul food.)

2273
01:19:51,057 --> 01:19:54,266
(It's a place that sates people's hunger after work.)

2274
01:19:54,267 --> 01:19:58,796
(The haven for the workers of Jamsil, Bangi Food Road)

2275
01:19:58,797 --> 01:20:00,436
Yi Kyung, this place is...

2276
01:20:00,437 --> 01:20:02,507
- This is the place. - I remember.

2277
01:20:02,867 --> 01:20:05,206
- The apartment you gave to me. - That's right.

2278
01:20:05,207 --> 01:20:07,606
I know this place well.

2279
01:20:07,607 --> 01:20:08,676
I can't believe I came here with you again.

2280
01:20:08,677 --> 01:20:10,247
He used to live here.

2281
01:20:10,307 --> 01:20:12,046
(Yi Kyung and Daniel's place was at the Bangi Food Road.)

2282
01:20:12,047 --> 01:20:14,647
It's near our old house.

2283
01:20:14,747 --> 01:20:17,856
I want to see our old house. It's right next to this road.

2284
01:20:17,857 --> 01:20:20,757
Yi Kyung, this place has changed so much.

2285
01:20:21,127 --> 01:20:23,656
We used to live over here and there.

2286
01:20:23,657 --> 01:20:25,757
- Did you guys live here? - This building.

2287
01:20:26,227 --> 01:20:28,347
- This is the triple place. - This is the restaurant.

2288
01:20:28,667 --> 01:20:29,897
This is the restaurant.

2289
01:20:30,027 --> 01:20:31,736
- My goodness. - This is the restaurant.

2290
01:20:31,737 --> 01:20:33,336
- There are so many things to see. - Daniel.

2291
01:20:33,337 --> 01:20:34,966
- This is the restaurant. - You should pay for everyone.

2292
01:20:34,967 --> 01:20:36,706
You should pay for everyone.

2293
01:20:36,707 --> 01:20:39,436
- We told you. We gave you a hint. - Hold on.

2294
01:20:39,437 --> 01:20:41,446
- There are too many people. - As you go in, say,

2295
01:20:41,447 --> 01:20:43,606
- "It's on me!" - No!

2296
01:20:43,607 --> 01:20:44,876
- "My name is Choi Daniel." - No!

2297
01:20:44,877 --> 01:20:45,877
- "It's on me!" - "It's on me!"

2298
01:20:45,878 --> 01:20:47,076
Hold on a second.

2299
01:20:47,077 --> 01:20:49,046
- Don't be ridiculous. - You should do it once.

2300
01:20:49,047 --> 01:20:50,047
Don't be...

2301
01:20:50,048 --> 01:20:52,556
- Say, "Hello, I'm Choi Daniel." - No. People will misunderstand.

2302
01:20:52,557 --> 01:20:54,026
- Hello. - No.

2303
01:20:54,027 --> 01:20:56,556
- Hello. - My goodness.

2304
01:20:56,557 --> 01:20:57,857
(He still says hello politely.)

2305
01:20:58,897 --> 01:21:02,727
(It's on the main street of the Bangi Food Road.)

2306
01:21:02,967 --> 01:21:09,167
(It's the beef tripe paradise that's always full of people.)

2307
01:21:11,477 --> 01:21:12,576
(The 1st branch)

2308
01:21:12,577 --> 01:21:15,747
(There are 3 branches on Bangi Food Road alone.)

2309
01:21:15,877 --> 01:21:19,947
(It's a beef tripe restaurant that represents Bangi Food Road.)

2310
01:21:20,747 --> 01:21:26,087
(The most popular menu is assorted tripe.)

2311
01:21:27,857 --> 01:21:30,756
(Rectum)

2312
01:21:30,757 --> 01:21:33,026
(Small intestine)

2313
01:21:33,027 --> 01:21:35,066
(Stomach)

2314
01:21:35,067 --> 01:21:37,167
(Heart)

2315
01:21:37,437 --> 01:21:40,097
(The creamy digestive fluid is the best.)

2316
01:21:40,437 --> 01:21:44,377
(DMR 2, Beef tripe)

2317
01:21:44,477 --> 01:21:46,006
- Hello. - My goodness.

2318
01:21:46,007 --> 01:21:47,707
- Hello. - Hello.

2319
01:21:48,047 --> 01:21:50,246
- What's the assorted tripe? - The assorted tripe...

2320
01:21:50,247 --> 01:21:52,676
is a mix of small intestine, large intestine, and rectum.

2321
01:21:52,677 --> 01:21:53,816
Is it beef?

2322
01:21:53,817 --> 01:21:55,587
- Three assorted tripe? - No.

2323
01:21:55,687 --> 01:21:57,286
We should order one beef tripe...

2324
01:21:57,287 --> 01:21:59,216
so that we can see the presentation.

2325
01:21:59,217 --> 01:22:00,256
May I give a recommendation?

2326
01:22:00,257 --> 01:22:01,756
- Please go ahead. - What should we do?

2327
01:22:01,757 --> 01:22:04,256
One tripe, one assorted tripe, and one stomach.

2328
01:22:04,257 --> 01:22:05,856
- We'll order those. - Okay.

2329
01:22:05,857 --> 01:22:07,137
- That sounds good. - Thank you.

2330
01:22:07,227 --> 01:22:08,397
It'll be delicious.

2331
01:22:08,667 --> 01:22:09,727
You know,

2332
01:22:09,827 --> 01:22:11,966
- it's better than I expected. - It isn't expensive.

2333
01:22:11,967 --> 01:22:14,306
- King crab was too expensive. - I know.

2334
01:22:14,307 --> 01:22:16,836
Since it was beef tripe,

2335
01:22:16,837 --> 01:22:18,883
I thought that a serving would cost 50 to 70 dollars.

2336
01:22:18,907 --> 01:22:20,377
It's inexpensive.

2337
01:22:20,637 --> 01:22:21,883
Is it more expensive in other places?

2338
01:22:21,907 --> 01:22:23,546
- It's much more expensive. - Really?

2339
01:22:23,547 --> 01:22:24,946
That's right. It's twice as expensive.

2340
01:22:24,947 --> 01:22:26,076
- Really? - Otherwise...

2341
01:22:26,077 --> 01:22:29,017
Daniel, can we see the total amount you've paid?

2342
01:22:29,447 --> 01:22:32,117
Sure. My wallet is here.

2343
01:22:32,257 --> 01:22:33,716
Show us the receipts you paid for.

2344
01:22:33,717 --> 01:22:35,556
It's the one from earlier. It isn't that one.

2345
01:22:35,557 --> 01:22:36,686
Give me the numbers.

2346
01:22:36,687 --> 01:22:39,327
- It's 59 dollars. - It's 59 dollars.

2347
01:22:39,457 --> 01:22:42,996
- It's 264 dollars. - It's 264 dollars.

2348
01:22:42,997 --> 01:22:44,166
For goodness' sake.

2349
01:22:44,167 --> 01:22:47,237
(The receipt for the king crab makes his heart ache.)

2350
01:22:47,607 --> 01:22:50,107
- It's 51 dollars. - It's 51 dollars.

2351
01:22:50,837 --> 01:22:52,006
And this receipt is for 82 dollars.

2352
01:22:52,007 --> 01:22:53,307
It's still lacking.

2353
01:22:53,707 --> 01:22:56,077
- The total is 456 dollars. - Come on.

2354
01:22:56,647 --> 01:22:58,847
(He paid 770 dollars at once.)

2355
01:22:59,277 --> 01:23:00,676
What do you mean that it's lacking?

2356
01:23:00,677 --> 01:23:02,916
Why would it be lacking?

2357
01:23:02,917 --> 01:23:04,356
It's quite lacking.

2358
01:23:04,357 --> 01:23:06,086
Why would it be lacking?

2359
01:23:06,087 --> 01:23:08,657
- We need a target sum. - A target sum?

2360
01:23:08,727 --> 01:23:10,586
- I paid a lot. - If it goes over 500 dollars,

2361
01:23:10,587 --> 01:23:12,226
you'll get the Handsome Guys merchandise.

2362
01:23:12,227 --> 01:23:13,956
(If it goes over 500 dollars, )

2363
01:23:13,957 --> 01:23:15,677
(you'll get the Handsome Guys merchandise.)

2364
01:23:15,767 --> 01:23:18,636
- I don't need it. - A clock or a plushie.

2365
01:23:18,637 --> 01:23:20,597
You also get a chance to visit the show again.

2366
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:21,667
A chance to visit the show again?

2367
01:23:21,668 --> 01:23:23,636
I don't need it. If I get it,

2368
01:23:23,637 --> 01:23:24,807
I'll rip it.

2369
01:23:25,537 --> 01:23:27,446
I imitated Ong-Bak.

2370
01:23:27,447 --> 01:23:29,106
I gave the king crab show.

2371
01:23:29,107 --> 01:23:31,316
But I paid for everything.

2372
01:23:31,317 --> 01:23:33,246
When Seung Ho did the same,

2373
01:23:33,247 --> 01:23:34,546
we gave him an exemption card.

2374
01:23:34,547 --> 01:23:36,386
If you end up paying for the last food item as well,

2375
01:23:36,387 --> 01:23:37,963
we'll give you an exemption card for the next visit.

2376
01:23:37,987 --> 01:23:39,016
Then you won't need to pay so often.

2377
01:23:39,017 --> 01:23:40,257
There won't be a next visit.

2378
01:23:40,857 --> 01:23:42,026
The next visit...

2379
01:23:42,027 --> 01:23:43,926
You should go out on the street...

2380
01:23:43,927 --> 01:23:45,327
(Here are the side dishes.)

2381
01:23:45,797 --> 01:23:47,826
- Gosh, these are... - Raw liver and omasum.

2382
01:23:47,827 --> 01:23:50,027
(Fresh raw liver and omasum)

2383
01:23:50,597 --> 01:23:52,496
(My goodness)

2384
01:23:52,497 --> 01:23:53,667
Gosh, these are...

2385
01:23:55,167 --> 01:23:56,607
They're bound to be tasty.

2386
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:58,536
We get them on the same day...

2387
01:23:58,537 --> 01:23:59,636
- the cow gets butchered. - Omasum...

2388
01:23:59,637 --> 01:24:02,876
- On the same day. - Thus, it's fresh.

2389
01:24:02,877 --> 01:24:04,777
- Did you say "Daniel?" - On the same day.

2390
01:24:04,947 --> 01:24:06,016
The same day.

2391
01:24:06,017 --> 01:24:07,986
- The same day? I see. - Thank you.

2392
01:24:07,987 --> 01:24:10,217
Dong Hyun, do you eat these things?

2393
01:24:10,547 --> 01:24:11,716
No, he doesn't. I bet he doesn't.

2394
01:24:11,717 --> 01:24:14,116
- As for me, - He doesn't eat them.

2395
01:24:14,117 --> 01:24:15,726
- these food items are a bit... - Can we eat them then?

2396
01:24:15,727 --> 01:24:17,527
I don't eat them either.

2397
01:24:18,497 --> 01:24:20,357
- Can we eat them then? - Give them to us.

2398
01:24:20,557 --> 01:24:21,826
Hold on. No.

2399
01:24:21,827 --> 01:24:23,327
(Stop for a second.)

2400
01:24:23,927 --> 01:24:25,736
You guys don't eat them.

2401
01:24:25,737 --> 01:24:27,297
- You guys don't eat them. - No.

2402
01:24:27,367 --> 01:24:29,006
- Neither one eats them. - No.

2403
01:24:29,007 --> 01:24:31,506
- What's the point? - No.

2404
01:24:31,507 --> 01:24:33,427
- What's the point? - If you're going to eat it,

2405
01:24:33,677 --> 01:24:34,906
- Again? - become Ong-Bak here.

2406
01:24:34,907 --> 01:24:38,017
(Become Ong-Bak here.)

2407
01:24:38,747 --> 01:24:41,317
- He's into Ong-Bak today. - Go outside.

2408
01:24:41,717 --> 01:24:43,886
(Getting revenge with Ong-Bak)

2409
01:24:43,887 --> 01:24:45,317
As you come inside,

2410
01:24:45,617 --> 01:24:48,457
become Ong-Bak.

2411
01:24:49,287 --> 01:24:50,456
Gosh.

2412
01:24:50,457 --> 01:24:52,596
(Do it like this.)

2413
01:24:52,597 --> 01:24:54,296
Why are you doing it yourself?

2414
01:24:54,297 --> 01:24:55,396
(Why are you doing it yourself?)

2415
01:24:55,397 --> 01:24:56,697
He's doing it himself.

2416
01:24:56,867 --> 01:24:59,197
- Why are you doing it yourself? - Come in like this.

2417
01:24:59,597 --> 01:25:01,467
- Gosh. - It's coming.

2418
01:25:03,107 --> 01:25:05,436
(The dish finally appears.)

2419
01:25:05,437 --> 01:25:06,976
- Gosh! - It's all cooked.

2420
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:08,077
You can eat it right away.

2421
01:25:08,807 --> 01:25:11,977
(The precooked large intestine and tripe get placed.)

2422
01:25:13,017 --> 01:25:14,587
(Sizzling)

2423
01:25:14,947 --> 01:25:18,057
(Next up is the grilled beef tripe!)

2424
01:25:18,587 --> 01:25:21,757
(Filled with digestive fluids)

2425
01:25:22,157 --> 01:25:25,227
(Garlic and onion get added on top.)

2426
01:25:25,597 --> 01:25:28,267
(The kick to enhance the flavor, seasoned chives)

2427
01:25:28,697 --> 01:25:32,667
(The finishing touch with the beef heart!)

2428
01:25:34,407 --> 01:25:38,537
(Representative dish, assorted tripe)

2429
01:25:39,277 --> 01:25:40,946
It's all cooked. You can eat it right away.

2430
01:25:40,947 --> 01:25:41,976
- Gosh. - Can we?

2431
01:25:41,977 --> 01:25:43,276
This is what I like.

2432
01:25:43,277 --> 01:25:44,346
This is exactly it.

2433
01:25:44,347 --> 01:25:45,677
(This is just my style.)

2434
01:25:45,877 --> 01:25:46,947
This is insane.

2435
01:25:47,317 --> 01:25:49,317
Gosh, it's served like this.

2436
01:25:50,317 --> 01:25:52,317
You would be able to eat this even if you're full.

2437
01:25:53,787 --> 01:25:56,887
(A stunning look)

2438
01:25:57,597 --> 01:26:00,397
(The time of joy begins.)

2439
01:26:00,697 --> 01:26:03,727
(The time of unhappiness begins.)

2440
01:26:03,997 --> 01:26:07,297
(They are ready to attack with their eating.)

2441
01:26:07,637 --> 01:26:09,236
(Quietly getting the chopsticks)

2442
01:26:09,237 --> 01:26:10,307
This is insane.

2443
01:26:11,207 --> 01:26:12,276
(Eye contact)

2444
01:26:12,277 --> 01:26:14,277
You would be able to eat this even if you're full.

2445
01:26:14,547 --> 01:26:15,547
(Tapping)

2446
01:26:15,548 --> 01:26:16,847
- Gosh! - Gosh!

2447
01:26:17,247 --> 01:26:18,617
(What is going on?)

2448
01:26:18,817 --> 01:26:20,753
- I was going to control the fire. - Give me the chopsticks.

2449
01:26:20,777 --> 01:26:22,417
Give me the chopsticks.

2450
01:26:23,287 --> 01:26:24,517
(Dispirited)

2451
01:26:24,557 --> 01:26:26,056
(He takes away all of their chopsticks.)

2452
01:26:26,057 --> 01:26:27,186
Do you want your chopsticks back?

2453
01:26:27,187 --> 01:26:28,987
Become Ong-Bak.

2454
01:26:29,657 --> 01:26:31,327
Come in like Ong-Bak.

2455
01:26:31,757 --> 01:26:34,126
(Laughing)

2456
01:26:34,127 --> 01:26:36,027
- He's doing it! - He's doing it!

2457
01:26:36,827 --> 01:26:39,366
(Tae Hyun makes an attempt of becoming Ong-Bak.)

2458
01:26:39,367 --> 01:26:40,367
He's doing it!

2459
01:26:42,167 --> 01:26:45,837
(Ong-Bak Cha has come to claim his chopsticks.)

2460
01:26:46,077 --> 01:26:48,576
(Give me the chopsticks.)

2461
01:26:48,577 --> 01:26:49,606
Okay.

2462
01:26:49,607 --> 01:26:50,947
- Here you are. - Yes!

2463
01:26:51,017 --> 01:26:52,046
- Gosh. - Gosh.

2464
01:26:52,047 --> 01:26:54,617
- That was great, Tae Hyun. - The standards are so high.

2465
01:26:54,847 --> 01:26:56,586
The standards are so high.

2466
01:26:56,587 --> 01:26:58,787
(The cut-off point for the chopsticks is so high up.)

2467
01:26:59,187 --> 01:27:00,286
Do you want them?

2468
01:27:00,287 --> 01:27:02,057
Become Ong-Bak!

2469
01:27:02,257 --> 01:27:04,227
Who made Choi Daniel become like this?

2470
01:27:04,497 --> 01:27:06,256
You have adapted to our show right away.

2471
01:27:06,257 --> 01:27:07,326
Do you want them?

2472
01:27:07,327 --> 01:27:08,967
Become Ong-Bak!

2473
01:27:09,167 --> 01:27:10,267
Gosh.

2474
01:27:10,767 --> 01:27:14,236
- This is full of protein. - Hey!

2475
01:27:14,237 --> 01:27:16,937
Where did you get them?

2476
01:27:17,137 --> 01:27:18,836
They keep appearing. Give them to me.

2477
01:27:18,837 --> 01:27:20,536
- Give them to me. - Are you a wizard?

2478
01:27:20,537 --> 01:27:22,906
Why are you taking away our chopsticks?

2479
01:27:22,907 --> 01:27:24,307
Why are there so many chopsticks?

2480
01:27:24,647 --> 01:27:25,747
No!

2481
01:27:26,177 --> 01:27:27,787
No!

2482
01:27:29,647 --> 01:27:30,687
No.

2483
01:27:30,787 --> 01:27:35,126
(Laughing)

2484
01:27:35,127 --> 01:27:36,786
The peppers should be moved away too.

2485
01:27:36,787 --> 01:27:38,403
(The pepper chopsticks are taken away too.)

2486
01:27:38,427 --> 01:27:40,556
(Feeling bitter)

2487
01:27:40,557 --> 01:27:41,967
My gosh.

2488
01:27:42,227 --> 01:27:43,526
(The eating show starts in earnest.)

2489
01:27:43,527 --> 01:27:44,896
You should eat it quickly. It's going to burn.

2490
01:27:44,897 --> 01:27:46,467
- It looks great. - Gosh.

2491
01:27:47,067 --> 01:27:49,166
It's filled with digestive fluid.

2492
01:27:49,167 --> 01:27:50,306
(He picks up the plump beef tripe.)

2493
01:27:50,307 --> 01:27:52,106
- It's filled. - This is the beef tripe, right?

2494
01:27:52,107 --> 01:27:53,427
It's filled with digestive fluid.

2495
01:27:54,037 --> 01:27:58,376
(The beef tripe is filled with digestive fluid.)

2496
01:27:58,377 --> 01:27:59,377
It's so good.

2497
01:28:00,577 --> 01:28:02,217
- Are we not eating at all? - For now.

2498
01:28:02,417 --> 01:28:03,686
(Gulping)

2499
01:28:03,687 --> 01:28:05,657
- It's so good. - Right.

2500
01:28:06,017 --> 01:28:08,857
(Another bite with the seasoned chives)

2501
01:28:13,927 --> 01:28:17,327
(Daniel goes for the large intestine.)

2502
01:28:17,597 --> 01:28:18,697
Gosh.

2503
01:28:20,797 --> 01:28:21,807
(Groaning)

2504
01:28:22,307 --> 01:28:23,467
(This is it!)

2505
01:28:23,867 --> 01:28:28,777
(The digestive fluid's soft scent and texture fills the mouth.)

2506
01:28:30,277 --> 01:28:31,517
Is that your first bite?

2507
01:28:32,317 --> 01:28:33,776
(Large intestine lover)

2508
01:28:33,777 --> 01:28:34,817
It's so good.

2509
01:28:36,447 --> 01:28:37,956
It's really cheap.

2510
01:28:37,957 --> 01:28:40,037
(He goes for a third bite with the seasoned chives.)

2511
01:28:42,227 --> 01:28:44,087
Along with the seasoned chives. My goodness.

2512
01:28:44,857 --> 01:28:46,857
- It's a work of art. - Gosh!

2513
01:28:49,627 --> 01:28:51,767
It's filled with the digestive fluid.

2514
01:28:52,237 --> 01:28:54,537
You can feel something very creamy.

2515
01:28:56,067 --> 01:28:58,076
(The creamy digestive fluid seeps out...)

2516
01:28:58,077 --> 01:29:00,077
(as soon as you take a bite.)

2517
01:29:00,677 --> 01:29:04,346
(He can't stand it.)

2518
01:29:04,347 --> 01:29:06,147
- Check this out. - Is this the beef tripe?

2519
01:29:06,577 --> 01:29:08,217
Yes. It was grilled well.

2520
01:29:08,447 --> 01:29:09,487
Gosh, it's hot.

2521
01:29:09,687 --> 01:29:12,387
(Tasting the creamy beef tripe)

2522
01:29:13,187 --> 01:29:15,957
Daniel doesn't usually eat this well.

2523
01:29:17,287 --> 01:29:18,827
I'm suddenly getting competitive.

2524
01:29:20,357 --> 01:29:22,127
Why would you eat out of competitiveness?

2525
01:29:23,327 --> 01:29:25,267
Why would you eat out of competitiveness?

2526
01:29:26,437 --> 01:29:27,806
It's hot! You can feel the digestive fluid coming out, right?

2527
01:29:27,807 --> 01:29:28,837
It's hot.

2528
01:29:30,967 --> 01:29:31,976
It's so good.

2529
01:29:31,977 --> 01:29:33,976
(It's so good.)

2530
01:29:33,977 --> 01:29:35,146
- What is that? The heart? - What is that?

2531
01:29:35,147 --> 01:29:36,427
- The heart. - That's the heart?

2532
01:29:36,707 --> 01:29:37,746
I like the texture of that the most.

2533
01:29:37,747 --> 01:29:38,777
Am I right about this?

2534
01:29:39,217 --> 01:29:41,616
Is this the heart that is sold at chicken skewer restaurants?

2535
01:29:41,617 --> 01:29:44,616
Yes. The crunchy texture feels really nice.

2536
01:29:44,617 --> 01:29:46,487
Really? I'll give it a try.

2537
01:29:47,257 --> 01:29:48,897
- That's the beef... - This is the heart?

2538
01:29:50,027 --> 01:29:52,227
- Really? - The beef heart.

2539
01:29:52,597 --> 01:29:54,843
- It has a good texture, right? - I didn't know it was the heart.

2540
01:29:54,867 --> 01:29:56,227
I didn't know it was the heart.

2541
01:29:56,797 --> 01:29:59,296
This is highly rich in protein and iron.

2542
01:29:59,297 --> 01:30:00,866
I just thought...

2543
01:30:00,867 --> 01:30:03,306
these were free pieces of meat served when ordering beef tripe.

2544
01:30:03,307 --> 01:30:04,366
But this is...

2545
01:30:04,367 --> 01:30:05,607
Why has your voice gone hoarse?

2546
01:30:05,907 --> 01:30:07,507
I shouted so much out of joy.

2547
01:30:08,307 --> 01:30:09,907
I shouted so much after beating Daniel.

2548
01:30:11,047 --> 01:30:12,047
I'm sorry.

2549
01:30:12,048 --> 01:30:14,147
(I'm sorry.)

2550
01:30:16,687 --> 01:30:18,686
(Laughing)

2551
01:30:18,687 --> 01:30:20,687
- "I'm sorry." - Earlier...

2552
01:30:21,457 --> 01:30:23,656
Let's eat in peace together.

2553
01:30:23,657 --> 01:30:25,857
(Let's forget about the past and eat in peace!)

2554
01:30:26,257 --> 01:30:27,526
We need more beef tripe, don't we?

2555
01:30:27,527 --> 01:30:29,143
- We need more. - Right. We should get more.

2556
01:30:29,167 --> 01:30:31,796
We'll get two more portions of beef tripe.

2557
01:30:31,797 --> 01:30:33,237
- Two portions of beef tripe? - Yes.

2558
01:30:33,367 --> 01:30:36,036
Do you know this? Daniel has very good eyes.

2559
01:30:36,037 --> 01:30:37,936
- Right. - He had glasses on,

2560
01:30:37,937 --> 01:30:39,537
so I took a look at him on our way here.

2561
01:30:39,577 --> 01:30:41,546
His glasses were full of dust.

2562
01:30:41,547 --> 01:30:43,876
(His glasses were full of dust.)

2563
01:30:43,877 --> 01:30:44,916
Really?

2564
01:30:44,917 --> 01:30:46,176
- Are they not prescribed? - Isn't it hard to see?

2565
01:30:46,177 --> 01:30:47,277
You can't see through them!

2566
01:30:47,647 --> 01:30:49,447
Did you cry earlier?

2567
01:30:51,147 --> 01:30:52,816
- Aren't they prescribed? - No.

2568
01:30:52,817 --> 01:30:54,887
- He has really good eyes. - Right.

2569
01:30:56,127 --> 01:30:57,286
I see.

2570
01:30:57,287 --> 01:30:59,097
- They need to be cleaned. - Right.

2571
01:30:59,697 --> 01:31:00,927
What are they for?

2572
01:31:01,497 --> 01:31:03,727
- That should be right. - It's so good.

2573
01:31:04,267 --> 01:31:05,597
How should I clean these?

2574
01:31:06,497 --> 01:31:09,167
- I'll clean them for him with this. - That might take a while.

2575
01:31:09,407 --> 01:31:11,067
That might be the case.

2576
01:31:12,837 --> 01:31:15,946
(If they are cleaned with a wet towel...)

2577
01:31:15,947 --> 01:31:19,216
When a bit of time has passed and they are grilled a bit more,

2578
01:31:19,217 --> 01:31:20,416
they taste great.

2579
01:31:20,417 --> 01:31:21,986
Tae Hyun!

2580
01:31:21,987 --> 01:31:23,387
Are you sure you have cleaned them?

2581
01:31:23,687 --> 01:31:25,716
- It looks dirtier. - It looks dirtier.

2582
01:31:25,717 --> 01:31:27,987
How can you clean them with a wet towel?

2583
01:31:28,257 --> 01:31:31,357
Who cleans their glasses with a wet towel?

2584
01:31:31,627 --> 01:31:32,997
I'll clean them for you.

2585
01:31:36,127 --> 01:31:38,037
Daniel is smart!

2586
01:31:39,597 --> 01:31:41,506
You would be a fool to fall for that.

2587
01:31:41,507 --> 01:31:42,767
He's sharp.

2588
01:31:43,967 --> 01:31:45,006
Look at all the water.

2589
01:31:45,007 --> 01:31:47,176
(He's wiping off the water.)

2590
01:31:47,177 --> 01:31:49,246
I cleaned them so you can see well, Daniel.

2591
01:31:49,247 --> 01:31:50,277
All right.

2592
01:31:50,477 --> 01:31:52,916
Please give me a piece if you feel satisfied.

2593
01:31:52,917 --> 01:31:54,446
All right. Wait right there.

2594
01:31:54,447 --> 01:31:56,886
You'll see once you take a look.

2595
01:31:56,887 --> 01:31:57,887
(Clean)

2596
01:31:57,888 --> 01:31:59,916
- This isn't bad. - You'll know when you put them on.

2597
01:31:59,917 --> 01:32:00,986
This isn't bad.

2598
01:32:00,987 --> 01:32:02,827
They will feel different once you put them on.

2599
01:32:04,587 --> 01:32:06,826
(Impressed)

2600
01:32:06,827 --> 01:32:08,796
The world looks clear.

2601
01:32:08,797 --> 01:32:09,927
Can you give him a piece?

2602
01:32:10,067 --> 01:32:11,336
Could I get one piece?

2603
01:32:11,337 --> 01:32:12,966
(Will he get a piece just as promised?)

2604
01:32:12,967 --> 01:32:14,166
Sure!

2605
01:32:14,167 --> 01:32:15,666
(Sure!)

2606
01:32:15,667 --> 01:32:17,307
Thank you.

2607
01:32:17,407 --> 01:32:19,537
No! Stop!

2608
01:32:20,477 --> 01:32:21,507
No!

2609
01:32:22,447 --> 01:32:24,246
- It's for me. - Hold on. What is your name?

2610
01:32:24,247 --> 01:32:25,576
(What is your name?)

2611
01:32:25,577 --> 01:32:26,716
- Come on. - No way.

2612
01:32:26,717 --> 01:32:28,346
- I deserve... - Guess his name.

2613
01:32:28,347 --> 01:32:29,817
To eat a piece.

2614
01:32:30,747 --> 01:32:31,887
- He's mad. - Hold on.

2615
01:32:32,517 --> 01:32:33,756
- "What is your name?" - Guess his name.

2616
01:32:33,757 --> 01:32:34,797
(Freeloading out of anger)

2617
01:32:35,187 --> 01:32:36,987
We were in a shoot for eight hours together.

2618
01:32:37,357 --> 01:32:40,197
(Guess his name while you're at it.)

2619
01:32:40,327 --> 01:32:41,496
- Hold on. - We were together for so long.

2620
01:32:41,497 --> 01:32:42,996
- We've been together for hours. - Sang Ho?

2621
01:32:42,997 --> 01:32:44,597
- Gosh. - Sang Ho?

2622
01:32:45,037 --> 01:32:46,836
- Sang Ho? - Sang Ho?

2623
01:32:46,837 --> 01:32:47,837
(What did you say?)

2624
01:32:48,067 --> 01:32:50,106
He's eating until he guesses his name right?

2625
01:32:50,107 --> 01:32:51,807
(He really doesn't know.)

2626
01:32:52,377 --> 01:32:53,976
Please give us a bottle of soju.

2627
01:32:53,977 --> 01:32:56,277
(He needs some soju to deal with this situation.)

2628
01:32:56,747 --> 01:32:57,846
You should eat until he gets it right.

2629
01:32:57,847 --> 01:32:58,917
This must feel upsetting.

2630
01:32:59,177 --> 01:33:00,297
Hurry up and guess his name.

2631
01:33:00,777 --> 01:33:02,216
(Tell me my name.)

2632
01:33:02,217 --> 01:33:04,487
- You should know his name. - I'm Choi Daniel.

2633
01:33:04,887 --> 01:33:06,417
(What?)

2634
01:33:06,617 --> 01:33:10,126
(Introducing himself all of a sudden)

2635
01:33:10,127 --> 01:33:12,926
What is your name? Tell me your last name, at least.

2636
01:33:12,927 --> 01:33:14,256
(He didn't expect him to introduce himself.)

2637
01:33:14,257 --> 01:33:15,396
I should know your name.

2638
01:33:15,397 --> 01:33:16,966
- I'll tell you that. - I should know your name.

2639
01:33:16,967 --> 01:33:18,196
- What's your last name? - He's a man.

2640
01:33:18,197 --> 01:33:19,896
- I'm a Shin. - I see.

2641
01:33:19,897 --> 01:33:21,137
I'm a man.

2642
01:33:21,567 --> 01:33:22,737
You're Shin Man?

2643
01:33:23,337 --> 01:33:24,807
- Hold on. - Shin Man?

2644
01:33:25,107 --> 01:33:26,737
- I'll have another piece. - Hold on.

2645
01:33:26,977 --> 01:33:28,376
- All right. - Your name.

2646
01:33:28,377 --> 01:33:30,876
- Let's know each other's names. - I'm Shin Seung Ho.

2647
01:33:30,877 --> 01:33:33,377
Shin Seung Ho. Right.

2648
01:33:34,077 --> 01:33:35,116
You learned his name now?

2649
01:33:35,117 --> 01:33:36,816
Please capture this moment well.

2650
01:33:36,817 --> 01:33:39,056
- It's a historic moment. - Seung Ho.

2651
01:33:39,057 --> 01:33:42,426
Gosh, Daniel. You're truly precious.

2652
01:33:42,427 --> 01:33:43,587
(Your name is Shin Seung Ho.)

2653
01:33:43,727 --> 01:33:45,096
We never got each other's names.

2654
01:33:45,097 --> 01:33:46,297
- Really? - Yes.

2655
01:33:46,597 --> 01:33:48,827
Whenever I was about to ask, I was paying for the food.

2656
01:33:49,197 --> 01:33:51,837
I got so annoyed to even care about his name.

2657
01:33:52,837 --> 01:33:56,506
(Laughing)

2658
01:33:56,507 --> 01:33:58,613
You should ask for his name one more time before we end.

2659
01:33:58,637 --> 01:33:59,707
- Right. - Gosh.

2660
01:34:00,107 --> 01:34:01,476
Can we start with the quiz?

2661
01:34:01,477 --> 01:34:03,576
- Go for it. - So one person can join in.

2662
01:34:03,577 --> 01:34:05,177
- Go for it. - Okay.

2663
01:34:05,277 --> 01:34:07,016
- Complete the proverb. - Shall we start with Tae Hyun?

2664
01:34:07,017 --> 01:34:08,046
All right.

2665
01:34:08,047 --> 01:34:09,116
- We'll begin. - Okay.

2666
01:34:09,117 --> 01:34:10,346
- Birds of a feather... - Flock together.

2667
01:34:10,347 --> 01:34:11,387
Correct.

2668
01:34:11,557 --> 01:34:12,617
Be extremely devoted...

2669
01:34:12,717 --> 01:34:13,817
To your friend.

2670
01:34:14,087 --> 01:34:15,957
Incorrect. Seung Ho is out.

2671
01:34:16,257 --> 01:34:17,257
Those who have parted...

2672
01:34:17,687 --> 01:34:18,827
Are great?

2673
01:34:20,057 --> 01:34:21,867
Is that what it's about?

2674
01:34:22,167 --> 01:34:23,666
Incorrect. Those who have parted, will meet again.

2675
01:34:23,667 --> 01:34:24,837
I see.

2676
01:34:25,137 --> 01:34:26,296
I'll be the one to eat.

2677
01:34:26,297 --> 01:34:27,697
- It's Tae Hyun. - Join in with us.

2678
01:34:28,307 --> 01:34:33,507
(Beef tripe featuring a lot of seasoned chives)

2679
01:34:38,117 --> 01:34:40,076
(Chewy)

2680
01:34:40,077 --> 01:34:41,077
What was that?

2681
01:34:41,117 --> 01:34:42,316
(Impressed)

2682
01:34:42,317 --> 01:34:43,797
- Tae Hyun. - It's amazing, isn't it?

2683
01:34:44,587 --> 01:34:46,887
- You can't stop eating this. - You can eat it nonstop.

2684
01:34:48,157 --> 01:34:50,156
Jamsil was a historic place in 1988...

2685
01:34:50,157 --> 01:34:52,956
where the Seoul Summer Games were held.

2686
01:34:52,957 --> 01:34:56,266
One of our representative Summer Game gold medalists...

2687
01:34:56,267 --> 01:34:57,966
is Oh Sang Uk in fencing.

2688
01:34:57,967 --> 01:34:59,567
Right. He's one of our proud athletes.

2689
01:34:59,797 --> 01:35:03,366
Oh Sang Uk's main event is the sabre.

2690
01:35:03,367 --> 01:35:04,367
Sabre?

2691
01:35:04,407 --> 01:35:05,906
Which part must be attacked to win a point?

2692
01:35:05,907 --> 01:35:06,937
I know.

2693
01:35:07,537 --> 01:35:08,576
The upper body.

2694
01:35:08,577 --> 01:35:10,006
(Upper body)

2695
01:35:10,007 --> 01:35:11,047
Correct.

2696
01:35:12,377 --> 01:35:13,477
Thank you, Sang Uk.

2697
01:35:15,147 --> 01:35:16,216
Really?

2698
01:35:16,217 --> 01:35:18,687
(Yi Kyung goes for the large intestine.)

2699
01:35:21,627 --> 01:35:23,026
I'm not joking about this. You can't stop eating this.

2700
01:35:23,027 --> 01:35:24,956
- It's amazing. - You really can't stop.

2701
01:35:24,957 --> 01:35:27,456
This is what happens when you order the assorted tripe.

2702
01:35:27,457 --> 01:35:28,566
You can't get sick of it.

2703
01:35:28,567 --> 01:35:29,666
- When you get sick of one part, - You'll eat everything.

2704
01:35:29,667 --> 01:35:31,396
You can move onto a different part.

2705
01:35:31,397 --> 01:35:33,678
(You can never get sick of it as you choose what to eat.)

2706
01:35:33,737 --> 01:35:35,467
Please give us the last question.

2707
01:35:37,867 --> 01:35:39,277
I'm the only one left.

2708
01:35:39,507 --> 01:35:41,577
Then play rock-paper-scissors.

2709
01:35:41,747 --> 01:35:43,346
He might win right away when it's with two hands.

2710
01:35:43,347 --> 01:35:44,846
Let's play a single round with one hand.

2711
01:35:44,847 --> 01:35:46,153
- With one hand? - A single round?

2712
01:35:46,177 --> 01:35:47,816
- How does mukjjibba sound? - Okay.

2713
01:35:47,817 --> 01:35:49,286
- A single round of mukjjibba. - All right.

2714
01:35:49,287 --> 01:35:50,446
(Seung Ho's freeloader game, mukjjibba)

2715
01:35:50,447 --> 01:35:54,187
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

2716
01:35:54,257 --> 01:35:55,587
(Daniel attacks first.)

2717
01:35:55,687 --> 01:35:59,597
(What will he play?)

2718
01:36:03,697 --> 01:36:05,196
Paper!

2719
01:36:05,197 --> 01:36:06,437
(Paper?)

2720
01:36:07,097 --> 01:36:08,237
Paper.

2721
01:36:08,567 --> 01:36:10,906
(Culture shock)

2722
01:36:10,907 --> 01:36:11,937
Paper!

2723
01:36:12,007 --> 01:36:13,807
(That's enough.)

2724
01:36:13,907 --> 01:36:15,707
- What was that? - Paper.

2725
01:36:15,877 --> 01:36:16,877
Paper!

2726
01:36:16,947 --> 01:36:18,716
That's enough from you. You should go home.

2727
01:36:18,717 --> 01:36:22,347
- Get lost! - Leave!

2728
01:36:22,447 --> 01:36:25,256
Just go home.

2729
01:36:25,257 --> 01:36:26,317
Hold on.

2730
01:36:26,457 --> 01:36:27,717
That's enough.

2731
01:36:29,327 --> 01:36:30,456
(Closing the door)

2732
01:36:30,457 --> 01:36:31,457
That's enough.

2733
01:36:31,597 --> 01:36:32,597
You call this paper?

2734
01:36:33,057 --> 01:36:34,596
- I played paper. - How is this paper?

2735
01:36:34,597 --> 01:36:37,166
- There was... - Come on.

2736
01:36:37,167 --> 01:36:38,336
A mismatch.

2737
01:36:38,337 --> 01:36:40,667
- He definitely said paper, but... - "Paper!"

2738
01:36:41,167 --> 01:36:43,236
We played games with this guy?

2739
01:36:43,237 --> 01:36:44,237
(We played games with this guy?)

2740
01:36:44,238 --> 01:36:45,606
- All right. - We were together all day.

2741
01:36:45,607 --> 01:36:48,376
All right. That was great fun.

2742
01:36:48,377 --> 01:36:49,746
Let's play again.

2743
01:36:49,747 --> 01:36:51,106
- Let's play again. - That's enough.

2744
01:36:51,107 --> 01:36:52,477
We'll end it here.

2745
01:36:53,477 --> 01:36:54,676
- Let's play fair and square. - Just let him eat.

2746
01:36:54,677 --> 01:36:56,386
- You're going to play again? - All right.

2747
01:36:56,387 --> 01:36:58,187
"Fair and square?"

2748
01:36:58,787 --> 01:37:00,216
It's over once you make another mistake.

2749
01:37:00,217 --> 01:37:02,417
Lean our hands against each other like an action movie.

2750
01:37:03,287 --> 01:37:05,027
Hold on.

2751
01:37:05,727 --> 01:37:07,297
What is it that you want?

2752
01:37:07,757 --> 01:37:09,527
I'll play what you want.

2753
01:37:09,667 --> 01:37:12,796
Let's play like professionals fair and square.

2754
01:37:12,797 --> 01:37:13,797
Make our hands go against each other.

2755
01:37:13,798 --> 01:37:15,206
You can't do things like...

2756
01:37:15,207 --> 01:37:17,413
(We are all curious why mukjjibba must be played like this.)

2757
01:37:17,437 --> 01:37:20,177
This is what it feels like when I play against my son.

2758
01:37:20,937 --> 01:37:21,946
All right.

2759
01:37:21,947 --> 01:37:23,223
(Mukjjibba is played with the posture he wanted.)

2760
01:37:23,247 --> 01:37:26,477
(The moment when everyone holds their breath)

2761
01:37:27,347 --> 01:37:29,087
Scissors!

2762
01:37:34,417 --> 01:37:36,786
(Laughing)

2763
01:37:36,787 --> 01:37:38,597
He's just terrible at this.

2764
01:37:39,057 --> 01:37:40,057
Daniel.

2765
01:37:40,058 --> 01:37:41,497
(Feeling upset)

2766
01:37:41,597 --> 01:37:42,696
That was a great match.

2767
01:37:42,697 --> 01:37:44,366
He played it even after seeing it.

2768
01:37:44,367 --> 01:37:45,437
(That was a great match.)

2769
01:37:46,267 --> 01:37:47,436
All right then.

2770
01:37:47,437 --> 01:37:49,537
I'm someone who accepts results.

2771
01:37:49,867 --> 01:37:54,577
(Seung Ho finally takes a bite as a freeloader.)

2772
01:37:54,937 --> 01:37:56,046
That was a crazy ending.

2773
01:37:56,047 --> 01:37:57,346
I've never seen that before. "Paper!"

2774
01:37:57,347 --> 01:37:58,676
That's enough with games.

2775
01:37:58,677 --> 01:38:00,077
He said that with his mouth, but...

2776
01:38:00,317 --> 01:38:02,846
So what was the point of that?

2777
01:38:02,847 --> 01:38:04,046
What was that game for?

2778
01:38:04,047 --> 01:38:05,416
- We can all eat together. - We can all eat together.

2779
01:38:05,417 --> 01:38:06,917
Oh, right. Let's eat!

2780
01:38:07,757 --> 01:38:09,127
Let's eat!

2781
01:38:10,787 --> 01:38:12,157
Let's eat!

2782
01:38:13,027 --> 01:38:14,996
Please give us the bill, sir.

2783
01:38:14,997 --> 01:38:15,997
Okay.

2784
01:38:17,367 --> 01:38:18,437
It's the bill.

2785
01:38:20,437 --> 01:38:21,806
- It isn't that much. - It's fine.

2786
01:38:21,807 --> 01:38:22,866
- It isn't that much. - It isn't bad.

2787
01:38:22,867 --> 01:38:24,267
We still ate a lot.

2788
01:38:24,537 --> 01:38:26,097
- It's 186 dollars. - It's 186 dollars?

2789
01:38:26,777 --> 01:38:27,806
- For now... - Let's try to get it right.

2790
01:38:27,807 --> 01:38:29,276
- We can get it right. - Let's get it right.

2791
01:38:29,277 --> 01:38:31,076
- We can get it right. - Right. We can do it.

2792
01:38:31,077 --> 01:38:34,046
This is the 186-dollar bill for the beef tripe.

2793
01:38:34,047 --> 01:38:35,167
Please give us the question.

2794
01:38:35,317 --> 01:38:36,886
- Please check the picture. - What is this?

2795
01:38:36,887 --> 01:38:38,217
(What is this?)

2796
01:38:38,457 --> 01:38:39,557
This is my expertise.

2797
01:38:40,257 --> 01:38:43,427
Check the picture of the parts of the beef by-products.

2798
01:38:44,057 --> 01:38:45,697
The cow's intestines include...

2799
01:38:46,757 --> 01:38:49,666
the small intestine, large intestine,

2800
01:38:49,667 --> 01:38:52,566
abomasum, and rumen.

2801
01:38:52,567 --> 01:38:54,767
Please call out the correct numbers.

2802
01:38:56,307 --> 01:38:57,613
You had all of these parts today.

2803
01:38:57,637 --> 01:38:58,877
We ate all of them.

2804
01:38:59,037 --> 01:39:00,037
Dong Hyun.

2805
01:39:01,577 --> 01:39:03,207
Dong Hyun should know the parts well.

2806
01:39:03,647 --> 01:39:04,976
- Hold on. - Dong Hyun.

2807
01:39:04,977 --> 01:39:07,647
Small intestine, rumen, large intestine, and abomasum.

2808
01:39:08,587 --> 01:39:10,116
This is so hard.

2809
01:39:10,117 --> 01:39:12,656
All of the parts have the hints. It's easy.

2810
01:39:12,657 --> 01:39:13,793
- It's easy. - They have the hints.

2811
01:39:13,817 --> 01:39:15,886
- I know them. - Really?

2812
01:39:15,887 --> 01:39:16,887
- They have the hints. - This is so hard.

2813
01:39:16,888 --> 01:39:19,196
The rumen is wide and chewy.

2814
01:39:19,197 --> 01:39:20,396
- That's the stomach of the cow. - Right.

2815
01:39:20,397 --> 01:39:22,243
- It's highly rich in protein. - Rich in protein.

2816
01:39:22,267 --> 01:39:24,696
- Number 1 is the rumen. - The rumen.

2817
01:39:24,697 --> 01:39:25,736
(The rumen rich in protein is expected to be number 1!)

2818
01:39:25,737 --> 01:39:27,166
- Okay. You're right. - And...

2819
01:39:27,167 --> 01:39:28,666
This one is rich in protein too.

2820
01:39:28,667 --> 01:39:29,783
(This one is rich in protein too.)

2821
01:39:29,807 --> 01:39:34,277
(Rich in protein)

2822
01:39:35,307 --> 01:39:36,427
You said you knew the parts.

2823
01:39:38,007 --> 01:39:40,577
Why is the same thing written?

2824
01:39:41,717 --> 01:39:43,517
It's the 1st stomach and the 4th stomach.

2825
01:39:43,817 --> 01:39:45,017
They are both stomachs.

2826
01:39:46,587 --> 01:39:49,186
The small intestine is also the stomach.

2827
01:39:49,187 --> 01:39:50,826
That must be right. They are used for hot pots.

2828
01:39:50,827 --> 01:39:53,056
- This is the small intestine. - They are used for hot pots.

2829
01:39:53,057 --> 01:39:54,327
This is the small intestine.

2830
01:39:54,497 --> 01:39:56,566
- This part is the rumen. - Rumen?

2831
01:39:56,567 --> 01:39:57,826
They are used for soup.

2832
01:39:57,827 --> 01:39:59,337
- Rumen soup. - Right.

2833
01:39:59,697 --> 01:40:02,507
- The abomasum is chewy. Okay. - Right.

2834
01:40:02,567 --> 01:40:03,806
- The abomasum. - The abomasum.

2835
01:40:03,807 --> 01:40:05,483
- This is the large intestine. - The mushy part is that one.

2836
01:40:05,507 --> 01:40:06,936
- Okay. - Done.

2837
01:40:06,937 --> 01:40:08,206
(They have solved the quiz.)

2838
01:40:08,207 --> 01:40:10,947
- That's our answer. - What is the answer?

2839
01:40:11,407 --> 01:40:14,576
(Small intestine, rumen, abomasum, large intestine)

2840
01:40:14,577 --> 01:40:15,777
Please tell us with each part.

2841
01:40:17,287 --> 01:40:18,617
First of all...

2842
01:40:19,357 --> 01:40:20,787
That is the answer no matter what.

2843
01:40:21,287 --> 01:40:24,427
Number four as the large intestine.

2844
01:40:24,487 --> 01:40:25,527
Is it the large intestine?

2845
01:40:25,927 --> 01:40:27,407
- That was your answer, right? - Yes.

2846
01:40:28,127 --> 01:40:31,027
- Correct. - Okay!

2847
01:40:31,497 --> 01:40:33,137
- We got number three too. - Okay.

2848
01:40:33,467 --> 01:40:34,796
It's obvious.

2849
01:40:34,797 --> 01:40:36,406
I'm confused about numbers 1 and 2.

2850
01:40:36,407 --> 01:40:37,407
We'll be right.

2851
01:40:37,737 --> 01:40:38,737
What about the next one?

2852
01:40:39,907 --> 01:40:41,307
They are all incorrect.

2853
01:40:42,007 --> 01:40:43,306
- It'll be an individual match now. - That's how it should me.

2854
01:40:43,307 --> 01:40:45,027
You two will have to go against each other.

2855
01:40:45,177 --> 01:40:47,547
(You two are strangers now.)

2856
01:40:47,847 --> 01:40:50,386
(Again?)

2857
01:40:50,387 --> 01:40:51,646
We wanted to see this face.

2858
01:40:51,647 --> 01:40:53,186
If all three of them are incorrect,

2859
01:40:53,187 --> 01:40:54,556
you can match them up again.

2860
01:40:54,557 --> 01:40:55,877
- It's one or the other. - Right.

2861
01:40:56,587 --> 01:40:57,627
Go for it.

2862
01:40:57,827 --> 01:40:59,057
I have no idea.

2863
01:40:59,657 --> 01:41:00,997
Let's look at it together.

2864
01:41:01,157 --> 01:41:02,766
I'll look at it first.

2865
01:41:02,767 --> 01:41:04,326
- Come on. - I'll look at it first.

2866
01:41:04,327 --> 01:41:06,337
What happened to you guys all of a sudden?

2867
01:41:07,637 --> 01:41:09,666
- Hold on, Dong Hyun. - Aren't we on the same team?

2868
01:41:09,667 --> 01:41:11,636
Hold on, Dong Hyun.

2869
01:41:11,637 --> 01:41:13,236
We aren't allies anymore.

2870
01:41:13,237 --> 01:41:14,706
- Okay. - Right.

2871
01:41:14,707 --> 01:41:16,376
- It's an individual match. - It's an individual match.

2872
01:41:16,377 --> 01:41:17,846
(Please be understanding as it's an individual match.)

2873
01:41:17,847 --> 01:41:19,077
That's fine.

2874
01:41:19,877 --> 01:41:21,217
Was number three the omasum?

2875
01:41:22,087 --> 01:41:23,547
- No. - No?

2876
01:41:23,787 --> 01:41:25,817
They became enemies right away.

2877
01:41:27,057 --> 01:41:28,857
- Hold on. - Number two is the fried rice.

2878
01:41:29,387 --> 01:41:30,426
Hold on.

2879
01:41:30,427 --> 01:41:31,687
This is the soft drink.

2880
01:41:32,827 --> 01:41:33,856
This is the beer.

2881
01:41:33,857 --> 01:41:35,396
(Feeling dizzy)

2882
01:41:35,397 --> 01:41:36,426
This is the fried rice.

2883
01:41:36,427 --> 01:41:37,526
(Doing their best as 186 dollars is on the line)

2884
01:41:37,527 --> 01:41:39,867
- This is really hard. - This is really hard.

2885
01:41:40,537 --> 01:41:43,106
- Okay. I'll go for it right away. - Call out for it.

2886
01:41:43,107 --> 01:41:45,907
All three of them were incorrect. Remember that.

2887
01:41:46,377 --> 01:41:48,206
Please get it right and end it right here.

2888
01:41:48,207 --> 01:41:49,306
Everyone wants you to get it.

2889
01:41:49,307 --> 01:41:50,747
Number three is the small intestine.

2890
01:41:50,947 --> 01:41:52,117
- Right. - And...

2891
01:41:52,177 --> 01:41:55,017
number two is the abomasum.

2892
01:41:55,287 --> 01:41:56,846
Number one is the rumen.

2893
01:41:56,847 --> 01:41:57,886
The rumen.

2894
01:41:57,887 --> 01:41:58,917
Will he be right?

2895
01:41:59,257 --> 01:42:01,587
- That is... - What was that?

2896
01:42:01,887 --> 01:42:03,656
- He's correct? - He's correct.

2897
01:42:03,657 --> 01:42:07,726
(Correct)

2898
01:42:07,727 --> 01:42:10,767
Gosh, finally! He finally showed his doggedness!

2899
01:42:11,667 --> 01:42:13,967
- He's loving it. - He finally showed his doggedness!

2900
01:42:14,667 --> 01:42:15,966
- Congratulations. - Gosh!

2901
01:42:15,967 --> 01:42:17,436
- You deserved it. - Gosh!

2902
01:42:17,437 --> 01:42:18,876
(Congratulations!)

2903
01:42:18,877 --> 01:42:19,877
Finally!

2904
01:42:20,477 --> 01:42:22,206
That was a great match.

2905
01:42:22,207 --> 01:42:23,246
That was great.

2906
01:42:23,247 --> 01:42:25,946
I was able to eat great food thanks to you.

2907
01:42:25,947 --> 01:42:27,816
- Thank you. - Thank you, Daniel!

2908
01:42:27,817 --> 01:42:28,847
Thank you.

2909
01:42:28,987 --> 01:42:30,287
- Dong Hyun. - Yes?

2910
01:42:30,587 --> 01:42:31,687
It isn't that much.

2911
01:42:32,587 --> 01:42:34,286
(Dong Hyun will pay for the beef tripe.)

2912
01:42:34,287 --> 01:42:36,433
It feels like it has been a while since Dong Hyun has paid.

2913
01:42:36,457 --> 01:42:38,557
- Thank you, Dong Hyun. - Don't mention it.

2914
01:42:39,097 --> 01:42:41,096
If you paid even for this...

2915
01:42:41,097 --> 01:42:42,366
(If you paid even for this...)

2916
01:42:42,367 --> 01:42:44,266
You look a little upset.

2917
01:42:44,267 --> 01:42:45,436
It would've been fun to watch.

2918
01:42:45,437 --> 01:42:47,097
(Feeling slightly disappointed)

2919
01:42:47,997 --> 01:42:49,736
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2920
01:42:49,737 --> 01:42:50,966
(Receipt: Total of 186 dollars)

2921
01:42:50,967 --> 01:42:52,077
Come again.

2922
01:42:52,350 --> 01:42:53,820
(The next town)

2923
01:42:53,990 --> 01:42:56,659
(The town with great food loved by people around the world)

2924
01:42:56,660 --> 01:43:00,230
(Hannam-dong)

2925
01:43:01,030 --> 01:43:04,460
(Today's guest is called out with affection.)

2926
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:09,700
(Handsome Guys' honorary member, Jin)

2927
01:43:10,000 --> 01:43:12,410
(Welcome back!)

2928
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,910
(How much do you eat a day?)

2929
01:43:14,840 --> 01:43:16,640
(I eat half a meal a day.)

2930
01:43:16,780 --> 01:43:19,250
(A small eater on this eating show?)

2931
01:43:19,350 --> 01:43:21,949
(You won't be eating just half a meal today, right?)

2932
01:43:21,950 --> 01:43:22,950
(Tastes that will not allow that to happen)

2933
01:43:22,951 --> 01:43:25,490
(One, two, three meals)

2934
01:43:26,750 --> 01:43:28,190
(Putting his thumb up)

2935
01:43:28,520 --> 01:43:32,260
(It tastes so moving that he can eat 4 meals.)

2936
01:43:32,430 --> 01:43:33,490
(One more bite)

2937
01:43:34,190 --> 01:43:35,960
(It's mine.)

2938
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:38,399
(We'll give you food if you dance.)

2939
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:42,400
(This show makes the guests feel unpleasant.)

2940
01:43:42,500 --> 01:43:44,739
(He turns into bad Seok Jin.)

2941
01:43:44,740 --> 01:43:46,410
(- Do you want some? - Yes!)

2942
01:43:47,170 --> 01:43:48,209
(Here you go.)

2943
01:43:48,210 --> 01:43:49,880
(Eat it.)

2944
01:43:50,110 --> 01:43:53,410
(Want to see Jin who excels all the members?)

2945
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:57,720
(Will you come and watch again next week?)
