1
00:00:29,416 --> 00:00:31,226
(Lettuce,)

2
00:00:31,326 --> 00:00:33,186
(sesame leaves,)

3
00:00:33,386 --> 00:00:34,896
(spicy stir-fried pork,)

4
00:00:35,056 --> 00:00:37,255
(or boiled pork.)

5
00:00:37,256 --> 00:00:39,325
(Following their decision are...)

6
00:00:39,326 --> 00:00:41,295
(joy,)

7
00:00:41,296 --> 00:00:43,166
(regret,)

8
00:00:43,396 --> 00:00:45,806
(agony, and resolution.)

9
00:00:46,636 --> 00:00:49,306
(The era of abundance)

10
00:00:49,476 --> 00:00:51,576
(For modern people who struggle with this dilemma,)

11
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:56,015
(Handsome Guys will pick what to eat for you.)

12
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:58,146
(It begins now.)

13
00:00:58,546 --> 00:01:02,116
(An early summer day beneath a canopy of green)

14
00:01:02,274 --> 00:01:04,676
I love the energy of this mountain.

15
00:01:05,006 --> 00:01:06,106
This is an incredible neighborhood.

16
00:01:06,946 --> 00:01:09,475
(Where there's nature, literature,)

17
00:01:09,476 --> 00:01:12,016
(and art)

18
00:01:12,816 --> 00:01:14,455
- Hello.
- Hello.

19
00:01:14,456 --> 00:01:15,456
Hi.

20
00:01:15,756 --> 00:01:17,286
- Hi, everyone.
- What a great day...

21
00:01:17,626 --> 00:01:18,925
and a great neighborhood.

22
00:01:18,926 --> 00:01:20,055
It's so sunny.

23
00:01:20,056 --> 00:01:21,795
- I love this place.
- Mountains and water.

24
00:01:21,796 --> 00:01:23,725
- This place makes you feel calm.
- Yes.

25
00:01:23,726 --> 00:01:24,726
It does, doesn't it?

26
00:01:24,727 --> 00:01:26,266
- I feel like I should be quiet.
- I feel so good.

27
00:01:26,366 --> 00:01:28,595
We have a special guest today.

28
00:01:28,596 --> 00:01:29,596
- Do we?
- Yes.

29
00:01:29,597 --> 00:01:31,506
He and I are very close.

30
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:32,835
He's like my younger brother.

31
00:01:32,836 --> 00:01:34,005
- Younger brother?
- Yes.

32
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:36,536
You can't discuss food without him in this country.

33
00:01:36,836 --> 00:01:38,245
- I see.
- He must be an eating show person.

34
00:01:38,246 --> 00:01:39,906
- Someone who has an eating show.
- Yes.

35
00:01:40,006 --> 00:01:41,515
He's like a brother to me. Come on out.

36
00:01:41,516 --> 00:01:42,775
- What is it?
- He's preparing something.

37
00:01:42,776 --> 00:01:43,776
Come into the shot.

38
00:01:44,186 --> 00:01:45,686
(Cheering)

39
00:01:46,886 --> 00:01:48,415
- That detail.
- He's certainly...

40
00:01:48,416 --> 00:01:49,586
(They're already bursting into laughter.)

41
00:01:50,156 --> 00:01:51,756
- Come on out.
- I recognize those hands.

42
00:01:51,956 --> 00:01:54,095
(The blinds go up.)

43
00:01:54,096 --> 00:01:58,166
(And today's guest appears.)

44
00:01:59,026 --> 00:02:02,165
(The master of eating shows, Moon Se Yoon)

45
00:02:02,166 --> 00:02:03,895
- That detail.
- He's certainly...

46
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:05,705
(Entering boldly)

47
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:07,605
- He's good.
- I recognized him right away.

48
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:08,636
So good.

49
00:02:08,806 --> 00:02:09,975
He's clearly extraordinary.

50
00:02:09,976 --> 00:02:11,346
Those are all muscles.

51
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:14,315
- Now...
- You can tell he's determined.

52
00:02:14,316 --> 00:02:15,675
- Nice to meet you.
- He's muscular.

53
00:02:15,676 --> 00:02:17,616
- Se Yoon!
- Hey, Yi Kyung. Tae Hyun.

54
00:02:17,986 --> 00:02:20,416
- He's got a great attitude.
- Hey, Seung Ho.

55
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:22,815
Covering Se Yoon was pretty pointless...

56
00:02:22,816 --> 00:02:24,285
- that we could tell it was him...
- Indeed.

57
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:25,625
by his wide shoes.

58
00:02:25,626 --> 00:02:27,256
They're very wide.

59
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,096
(Fascinated)

60
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:31,926
Shouldn't I introduce myself?

61
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:33,595
- You can do it when you want to.
- Do I stand here?

62
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:35,965
- He's our star.
- Handsome Guys!

63
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:37,295
(Handsome Guys!)

64
00:02:37,296 --> 00:02:38,865
You came up with this before, didn't you?

65
00:02:38,866 --> 00:02:39,935
- Handsome Guys!
- You did, right?

66
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:41,435
He came prepared.

67
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:43,276
- What do you mean?
- He came up with that yesterday.

68
00:02:43,476 --> 00:02:45,705
I started smelling delicious food.

69
00:02:45,706 --> 00:02:46,905
- Where?
- Handsome Guys...

70
00:02:46,906 --> 00:02:49,675
is spreading the great smell of different types...

71
00:02:49,676 --> 00:02:51,286
of Korean food across the country.

72
00:02:51,316 --> 00:02:52,446
You said you'd introduce yourself.

73
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:53,885
- I have a long introduction.
- Will you please...

74
00:02:53,886 --> 00:02:55,585
- I have a long introduction.
- Who are you?

75
00:02:55,586 --> 00:02:57,855
I can't even count how long I've starved.

76
00:02:57,856 --> 00:02:59,255
It's been over 20 hours.

77
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:01,255
- You could do a gastroscopy on me.
- Okay.

78
00:03:01,256 --> 00:03:02,655
I came here to see...

79
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:04,325
what the members of this show have got.

80
00:03:04,326 --> 00:03:06,195
A man who's been doing eating shows for a decade, Master Moon Se Yoon.

81
00:03:06,196 --> 00:03:08,166
- I'm glad to be here!
- Great.

82
00:03:08,736 --> 00:03:09,935
- Okay.
- He called himself...

83
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:11,405
- the master of eating shows.
- Yes.

84
00:03:11,406 --> 00:03:14,506
I heard that I'd be able to eat delicious food on this show.

85
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:16,536
Haven't you known Dong Hyun for almost ten years?

86
00:03:16,676 --> 00:03:17,775
We go way back.

87
00:03:17,776 --> 00:03:19,876
There's one thing I realized that you could improve on.

88
00:03:20,006 --> 00:03:22,145
The title of the show is Handsome Guys, but...

89
00:03:22,146 --> 00:03:23,175
That's true.

90
00:03:23,176 --> 00:03:24,686
(But?)

91
00:03:25,216 --> 00:03:26,886
So, what's the intention behind that?

92
00:03:27,286 --> 00:03:28,685
Why is he...

93
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:30,115
- These three are "handsome," - Okay.

94
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:31,456
I'm "guy," and he's "s."

95
00:03:31,626 --> 00:03:32,955
- I see.
- Just the S?

96
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:34,226
I'm just the S?

97
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:35,555
We have our roles.

98
00:03:35,556 --> 00:03:38,026
That S must stand for "shabby."

99
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,495
- Put together, we're Handsome Guys.
- Now, I understand.

100
00:03:40,496 --> 00:03:41,735
Handsome Guys.

101
00:03:41,736 --> 00:03:43,795
- It had a deeper meaning.
- He says that,

102
00:03:43,796 --> 00:03:46,565
but I notice that he got thick makeup on today.

103
00:03:46,566 --> 00:03:48,035
- Why?
- Why did you do that?

104
00:03:48,036 --> 00:03:51,446
I just sit still while the stylist smacks my face.

105
00:03:51,946 --> 00:03:53,446
- "Smack." - Sometimes, she hits it hard.

106
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:55,745
I heard that she beat your face like a drum.

107
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:56,815
Yes, she does.

108
00:03:56,816 --> 00:03:58,715
When she's tired, she uses a sitting cushion.

109
00:03:58,716 --> 00:03:59,985
She knew that you'd be on Handsome Guys,

110
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:01,755
- so she smacked it hard.
- She did.

111
00:04:01,756 --> 00:04:04,186
She said she had to put intense makeup on me.

112
00:04:05,086 --> 00:04:06,986
- We're in Pyeongchang-dong today.
- Pyeongchang-dong.

113
00:04:07,156 --> 00:04:10,356
What kinds of restaurants do they have here?

114
00:04:11,296 --> 00:04:15,036
(Nestled deep in the arms of Mount Bukhan...)

115
00:04:16,636 --> 00:04:19,736
(is Pyeongchang-dong, today's neighborhood.)

116
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:23,375
(Behind fortress-like walls and tall gates...)

117
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:26,545
(are elegant houses on every street.)

118
00:04:26,546 --> 00:04:29,045
- There are museums.
- Yes, and galleries.

119
00:04:29,046 --> 00:04:30,845
- Even galleries?
- And art museums.

120
00:04:30,846 --> 00:04:34,216
(In the refined neighborhood of Pyeongchang-dong,)

121
00:04:34,356 --> 00:04:38,586
(what dishes would they recommend?)

122
00:04:38,956 --> 00:04:40,685
Pyeongchang sounds like "expansion" in Korean,

123
00:04:40,686 --> 00:04:42,596
so I feel like my stomach will expand so that I can eat a lot.

124
00:04:42,856 --> 00:04:45,525
- He keeps relating them to eating.
- Why...

125
00:04:45,526 --> 00:04:47,266
- do you keep circling back?
- Guys.

126
00:04:47,366 --> 00:04:49,335
How do you pronounce the Pyeongchang Winter Games?

127
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:50,566
- "Paengchang." - "Paengchang."

128
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:52,336
That's the Korean word for "expansion."

129
00:04:52,436 --> 00:04:53,906
It'll expand our stomachs.

130
00:04:54,006 --> 00:04:55,376
It feels great, doesn't it?

131
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:57,275
We need to cheer up.

132
00:04:57,276 --> 00:04:58,845
"Paengchang," let's go.

133
00:04:58,846 --> 00:05:00,545
- "Paengchang," let's go.
- So,

134
00:05:00,546 --> 00:05:02,746
in Pyeongchang-dong, we're eating...

135
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:04,416
black goat hot pot.

136
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,246
- Black goat hot pot?
- Black goat!

137
00:05:06,286 --> 00:05:07,886
My muscles are starting to twitch.

138
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:11,055
They're reacting to black goat!

139
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:12,626
They can't wait for me to eat it.

140
00:05:13,186 --> 00:05:15,195
- Do you eat black goat?
- I've never tried it before.

141
00:05:15,196 --> 00:05:16,455
- Me neither.
- No?

142
00:05:16,456 --> 00:05:17,595
I often eat it.

143
00:05:17,596 --> 00:05:18,825
- Black goat hot pot is...
- It's delicious.

144
00:05:18,826 --> 00:05:20,725
a hot pot that's similar...

145
00:05:20,726 --> 00:05:22,696
to chueotang.

146
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:24,635
- It's incredibly tasty.
- It is.

147
00:05:24,636 --> 00:05:26,265
- It's so good.
- It's so tender.

148
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:28,106
Also, apparently, it's well-known for leaf wraps and rice.

149
00:05:28,836 --> 00:05:30,735
- I love leaf wraps and rice.
- That sounds great.

150
00:05:30,736 --> 00:05:32,075
As you know, leaf wraps and rice are...

151
00:05:32,076 --> 00:05:33,805
served with meat, such as spicy stir-fried pork.

152
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:35,275
- Yes.
- And we can make different wraps.

153
00:05:35,276 --> 00:05:36,715
And the key feature is...

154
00:05:36,716 --> 00:05:38,146
fresh veggies.

155
00:05:38,186 --> 00:05:39,186
- You wrap them together.
- Indeed.

156
00:05:39,187 --> 00:05:40,485
- There are various kinds.
- And they snap when you fold them.

157
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:42,156
You know the feeling, right?

158
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:44,185
(Today's LMR,)

159
00:05:44,186 --> 00:05:45,956
(or Lunch Menu Recommendation)

160
00:05:46,256 --> 00:05:48,595
(Fresh and filling leaf wraps and rice)

161
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:50,795
(The popular stamina food, black goat hot pot)

162
00:05:50,796 --> 00:05:51,925
In fact,

163
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:53,465
people often ask you...

164
00:05:53,466 --> 00:05:54,965
- whether you want to eat ribs, - Yes.

165
00:05:54,966 --> 00:05:56,235
naengmyeon,

166
00:05:56,236 --> 00:05:57,395
- That's true.
- or Korean set menu.

167
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:59,235
My choice is always the closest restaurant.

168
00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:00,236
- But...
- Always.

169
00:06:00,237 --> 00:06:01,305
- But they don't tell us.
- We can't know.

170
00:06:01,306 --> 00:06:02,605
- They never tell us.
- Why not?

171
00:06:02,606 --> 00:06:03,606
Who knows?

172
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:05,645
You should start a labor union and file a formal complaint.

173
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:07,305
- They never tell us.
- They don't.

174
00:06:07,306 --> 00:06:08,415
You need to keep making complaints.

175
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:10,075
We're supposed to guess.

176
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:11,916
- Guess the restaurant?
- Yes, on your own.

177
00:06:12,086 --> 00:06:13,945
Then, we're going to the leaf wraps and rice place.

178
00:06:13,946 --> 00:06:16,455
- This part of the day is...
- Yes.

179
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:17,955
when the sun is in the sky...

180
00:06:17,956 --> 00:06:20,225
and you need to start the day.

181
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:22,125
- So, leaf wraps and rice.
- We need to go there...

182
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:23,895
and splash the guy next to you with the water from the veggies.

183
00:06:23,896 --> 00:06:25,695
Then, you wrap the ingredients and put them in your mouth.

184
00:06:25,696 --> 00:06:26,696
Indeed.

185
00:06:26,697 --> 00:06:28,535
- Then, what happens to the stomach?
- Sorry?

186
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:29,865
Oh, it expands.

187
00:06:29,866 --> 00:06:31,706
- It will expand after we eat.
- Right.

188
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:33,266
- Expansion.
- Expansion.

189
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:35,235
- He's good.
- I love his energy.

190
00:06:35,236 --> 00:06:37,575
I feel like we'll eat leaf wraps and rice first.

191
00:06:37,576 --> 00:06:39,545
I heard these two were the ace eaters here.

192
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:42,245
- Totally.
- It's a battle of titans.

193
00:06:42,246 --> 00:06:44,245
- I hope I can go with them...
- They're no joke.

194
00:06:44,246 --> 00:06:46,785
- because the environment matters.
- That's true.

195
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:48,815
We can eat more only if the other person also enjoys it.

196
00:06:48,816 --> 00:06:50,655
That's true.

197
00:06:50,656 --> 00:06:52,355
I want to eat...

198
00:06:52,356 --> 00:06:54,825
black goat hot pot to feel invigorated for once.

199
00:06:54,826 --> 00:06:57,295
I'll pick the food that my muscles crave.

200
00:06:57,296 --> 00:06:58,465
- What about you, Sang Uk?
- You're choosing black goat.

201
00:06:58,466 --> 00:06:59,525
I...

202
00:06:59,526 --> 00:07:01,995
(Here comes my eating mate.)

203
00:07:01,996 --> 00:07:04,165
I'm an athlete, so I have to pick black goat...

204
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,466
- for my stamina.
- Black goat.

205
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:08,175
- And Seung Ho?
- He's still thinking.

206
00:07:08,176 --> 00:07:09,675
I'll go with...

207
00:07:09,676 --> 00:07:11,646
(Don't tell me you're going with them.)

208
00:07:11,676 --> 00:07:13,076
black goat.

209
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:14,616
(Shocked)

210
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,975
Then, we're the ones left.

211
00:07:16,976 --> 00:07:18,446
- We're the small eaters.
- Right.

212
00:07:18,586 --> 00:07:20,715
What are you going to eat?

213
00:07:20,716 --> 00:07:22,416
He's disappointed.

214
00:07:23,186 --> 00:07:24,756
There's an upside, though.

215
00:07:24,786 --> 00:07:26,785
You can eat everything if you come with us.

216
00:07:26,786 --> 00:07:29,795
(Is he tempted?)

217
00:07:29,796 --> 00:07:30,855
Okay.

218
00:07:30,856 --> 00:07:33,125
- I'll train these rookies today.
- Okay.

219
00:07:33,126 --> 00:07:35,335
Seung Ho, Sang Uk, and Dong Hyun will eat black goat today.

220
00:07:35,336 --> 00:07:36,565
I wonder what it tastes like.

221
00:07:36,566 --> 00:07:38,135
Will we eat leaf wraps and rice first...

222
00:07:38,136 --> 00:07:39,805
or black goat hot pot?

223
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:41,035
Maybe they added a twist.

224
00:07:41,036 --> 00:07:42,105
It's leaf wraps and rice.

225
00:07:42,106 --> 00:07:44,075
(They'll eat leaf wraps and rice first for lunch.)

226
00:07:44,076 --> 00:07:45,376
It could have been very bad for you.

227
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,975
We'll go and expand our stomachs with Se Yoon while eating...

228
00:07:47,976 --> 00:07:49,615
- leaf wraps and rice.
- Let's expand.

229
00:07:49,616 --> 00:07:50,675
- Bang!
- Bang!

230
00:07:50,676 --> 00:07:51,745
Let's go.

231
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:52,785
- Come.
- All right.

232
00:07:52,786 --> 00:07:53,946
Expand.

233
00:07:54,386 --> 00:07:55,416
Bummer.

234
00:07:56,316 --> 00:07:57,515
(On their way to eat while appreciating the serenity.)

235
00:07:57,516 --> 00:07:59,626
Why does this neighborhood feel so peaceful?

236
00:07:59,856 --> 00:08:01,596
- It usually does.
- It's so peaceful.

237
00:08:01,896 --> 00:08:03,356
I guess the crew doesn't tag along.

238
00:08:03,396 --> 00:08:05,025
Our show is pretty relaxed.

239
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,226
It feels free.

240
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:11,266
This is a type of shop you'll only find in this neighborhood.

241
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:13,866
- What is that?
- It's a gallery.

242
00:08:13,966 --> 00:08:15,936
There are many painting shops.

243
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:17,235
(Exclaiming)

244
00:08:17,236 --> 00:08:18,476
I bet it's delicious.

245
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:20,245
- Let's enjoy the food.
- It's also good news...

246
00:08:20,246 --> 00:08:21,746
- that we're not walking uphill.
- It is.

247
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:24,275
- No obstacles at all.
- Hurry! He's hungry!

248
00:08:24,276 --> 00:08:25,486
Okay.

249
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:27,215
Why are they so relaxed? You guys already ate, didn't you?

250
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:28,756
No, we didn't.

251
00:08:28,816 --> 00:08:30,756
Hang on. "Leaf wraps and rice."

252
00:08:30,856 --> 00:08:32,586
- It must be nearby.
- It's this way.

253
00:08:32,786 --> 00:08:33,825
This is it, right?

254
00:08:33,826 --> 00:08:35,456
- It is.
- Hold on.

255
00:08:36,096 --> 00:08:37,725
This has to be a popular restaurant.

256
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:38,866
It looks amazing.

257
00:08:41,196 --> 00:08:45,036
(A place where you can experience the charm of tradition)

258
00:08:46,336 --> 00:08:48,035
(Beloved by longtime residents,)

259
00:08:48,036 --> 00:08:49,706
(families, friends, and couples alike,)

260
00:08:50,036 --> 00:08:52,805
(this spot offers a warm meal...)

261
00:08:52,806 --> 00:08:58,816
(framed by the beauty of nature.)

262
00:09:00,086 --> 00:09:04,186
(LMR 1, leaf wraps and rice)

263
00:09:04,626 --> 00:09:05,885
(Sweating buckets)

264
00:09:05,886 --> 00:09:07,655
They have so many different veggies!

265
00:09:07,656 --> 00:09:08,955
There's only one item on the menu.

266
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:10,596
They have pyeonyuk.

267
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:11,866
They do.

268
00:09:11,896 --> 00:09:13,626
- They have 21 different leaf wraps!
- We should add...

269
00:09:13,696 --> 00:09:15,095
Look at those leaf wraps.

270
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,595
This is great.

271
00:09:16,596 --> 00:09:18,166
They have over 20 kinds.

272
00:09:18,236 --> 00:09:20,406
- I love these leaves.
- Right.

273
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:21,905
It tastes so good with one of those in your wrap.

274
00:09:21,906 --> 00:09:23,376
- It's got a strong scent.
- Right.

275
00:09:24,136 --> 00:09:25,376
Look at that sign.

276
00:09:25,506 --> 00:09:28,816
"Each stone pot rice is freshly cooked to order."

277
00:09:29,616 --> 00:09:31,285
That means it's going to take a while.

278
00:09:31,286 --> 00:09:33,116
I thought that it made them more trustworthy,

279
00:09:33,146 --> 00:09:34,755
and he said, "It's going to take a while."

280
00:09:34,756 --> 00:09:36,786
He must be thinking of ordering everything at once.

281
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:38,125
We need to...

282
00:09:38,126 --> 00:09:39,326
calculate this very well.

283
00:09:39,386 --> 00:09:41,156
- That's true.
- To see how long it takes.

284
00:09:41,856 --> 00:09:44,096
- Hello.
- Good afternoon.

285
00:09:44,296 --> 00:09:46,595
You have a variety of leaf wraps.

286
00:09:46,596 --> 00:09:48,295
We normally serve all those,

287
00:09:48,296 --> 00:09:50,435
but some of them have bad colors and are too small or too big...

288
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:53,035
- depending on the season, - Oh, the season.

289
00:09:53,036 --> 00:09:54,875
so you'll get about two-thirds of what you see on the menu.

290
00:09:54,876 --> 00:09:56,475
Will there be about 15 leaf wraps today?

291
00:09:56,476 --> 00:09:58,106
- It's always more than that.
- Really?

292
00:09:58,906 --> 00:10:00,905
(Look at Se Yoon.)

293
00:10:00,906 --> 00:10:01,945
(Fascinated)

294
00:10:01,946 --> 00:10:03,716
I needed to prepare myself.

295
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,486
It's because he sweats a lot.

296
00:10:05,716 --> 00:10:07,546
- We only have one item on the menu.
- Right.

297
00:10:07,646 --> 00:10:08,715
- Does it come with doenjang stew?
- Yes.

298
00:10:08,716 --> 00:10:10,585
- Doenjang stew.
- What type of meat is it?

299
00:10:10,586 --> 00:10:12,055
It's the type of boiled pork you're familiar with,

300
00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:14,486
but we only serve a small portion for you to add to the wraps.

301
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:16,295
- It's served as soon as we order?
- Yes, instantly.

302
00:10:16,296 --> 00:10:17,555
Then, we'll only order the regular dish first.

303
00:10:17,556 --> 00:10:18,625
Yes, let's check the basic setup.

304
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:19,865
- For three people, please.
- For three. Okay.

305
00:10:19,866 --> 00:10:21,365
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

306
00:10:21,366 --> 00:10:22,435
Thank you.

307
00:10:22,436 --> 00:10:25,036
(Please make it fast.)

308
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:27,035
Se Yoon, your album was a pretty big success.

309
00:10:27,036 --> 00:10:28,036
The recent one.

310
00:10:28,037 --> 00:10:29,105
It was produced by Rhymer.

311
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:30,605
I think he's making another one.

312
00:10:30,606 --> 00:10:31,776
Yes.

313
00:10:32,606 --> 00:10:34,775
(After his new song, "Teach Me," he and HANHAE will release...)

314
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:37,046
(a remake version of "Already One Year.")

315
00:10:37,446 --> 00:10:39,445
(Surprised)

316
00:10:39,446 --> 00:10:40,986
(Impressed)

317
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:50,256
(He can sing in delicate falsetto despite his large build.)

318
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:54,636
I didn't cash it in yet,

319
00:10:54,736 --> 00:10:56,936
but I believe it's going to be quite lucrative.

320
00:10:57,066 --> 00:10:58,405
I also listen to it a lot.

321
00:10:58,406 --> 00:11:00,265
It might not be a bad idea...

322
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:01,975
- to have you pay for this.
- Definitely.

323
00:11:01,976 --> 00:11:03,135
- He definitely can.
- No.

324
00:11:03,136 --> 00:11:04,535
I didn't make money to do that.

325
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:06,946
Then, why did you work so hard?

326
00:11:07,176 --> 00:11:08,645
I saw how terrible you were...

327
00:11:08,646 --> 00:11:10,175
- at quizzes and games.
- He can try to win.

328
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:11,785
But you need to know...

329
00:11:11,786 --> 00:11:13,485
- that the other two on your team...
- He can try.

330
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:15,055
are very good at quizzes.

331
00:11:15,056 --> 00:11:16,455
- Really?
- If you fail,

332
00:11:16,456 --> 00:11:17,515
you're more likely to pay.

333
00:11:17,516 --> 00:11:18,525
It's an individual game, so...

334
00:11:18,526 --> 00:11:19,756
- Okay.
- Goodness.

335
00:11:20,186 --> 00:11:22,095
Oh, it's this.

336
00:11:22,096 --> 00:11:23,526
- I know that.
- I've never seen it before.

337
00:11:23,556 --> 00:11:25,395
- We'll order another one.
- Sure.

338
00:11:25,396 --> 00:11:26,565
Order three more.

339
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:27,895
- Pyeonyuk.
- Se Yoon,

340
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:29,196
you should order three more.

341
00:11:29,496 --> 00:11:31,705
(Tender boiled pork,)

342
00:11:31,706 --> 00:11:33,966
(slowly simmered with a variety of medicinal herbs,)

343
00:11:34,366 --> 00:11:36,775
(is served alongside an assortment of seasonal greens...)

344
00:11:36,776 --> 00:11:39,176
(that can change with each visit.)

345
00:11:39,606 --> 00:11:42,745
(This set menu is modest yet thoughtfully prepared.)

346
00:11:42,746 --> 00:11:43,815
There's...

347
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:45,186
even pumpkin inside.

348
00:11:45,886 --> 00:11:48,016
They give you a lot of stone pot rice.

349
00:11:48,486 --> 00:11:51,255
The older generation must love this.

350
00:11:51,256 --> 00:11:52,455
- It's the best.
- Indeed.

351
00:11:52,456 --> 00:11:53,785
(Move the stone pot rice into a rice bowl first.)

352
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:55,095
It looks scrumptious.

353
00:11:55,096 --> 00:11:56,855
- This goes so well with rice.
- Good.

354
00:11:56,856 --> 00:12:00,165
(Making nurungji using Solomon's seal tea)

355
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,336
- Be careful. It's hot.
- Okay.

356
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:02,996
So, we just eat comfortably.

357
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:04,636
Thank you for the food.

358
00:12:05,006 --> 00:12:06,066
- It's hot.
- Okay.

359
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:08,006
Isn't it hot?

360
00:12:08,376 --> 00:12:09,506
It is hot.

361
00:12:10,406 --> 00:12:12,646
How did you eat that right away?

362
00:12:12,746 --> 00:12:13,876
You're supposed to endure it.

363
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:16,075
I love the smell of this doenjang stew.

364
00:12:16,076 --> 00:12:17,816
It's nice and warm.

365
00:12:19,046 --> 00:12:23,685
(Trying a spoon of doenjang stew)

366
00:12:23,686 --> 00:12:25,686
It tastes just like the one my grandma used to make.

367
00:12:25,886 --> 00:12:28,196
- It smells so delicious.
- Let's give it a taste.

368
00:12:29,156 --> 00:12:30,356
Did you try the rice?

369
00:12:30,626 --> 00:12:32,566
Now, I see why people love stone pot rice.

370
00:12:32,896 --> 00:12:34,625
(Eating stone pot rice in the order of sitting)

371
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:36,895
You always try a spoonful of stone pot rice first.

372
00:12:36,896 --> 00:12:38,736
(A heap)

373
00:12:40,866 --> 00:12:42,136
This stone pot rice...

374
00:12:42,576 --> 00:12:44,945
- The rice is good on its own.
- How come it's so good?

375
00:12:44,946 --> 00:12:47,305
All the side dishes look tastier when the rice is good.

376
00:12:47,306 --> 00:12:48,445
It's delicious.

377
00:12:48,446 --> 00:12:50,015
It looks so glutinous.

378
00:12:50,016 --> 00:12:51,845
I feel bad for making leaf wraps right away.

379
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:53,246
I should try one plainly.

380
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:54,616
Why do you feel bad?

381
00:12:54,786 --> 00:12:56,155
Well, I have to see what the meat tastes like...

382
00:12:56,156 --> 00:12:58,556
- by itself.
- That's true.

383
00:12:58,756 --> 00:12:59,855
Try one.

384
00:12:59,856 --> 00:13:02,656
(Se Yoon tries only the meat.)

385
00:13:04,496 --> 00:13:06,895
I sense a subtle hint of medicinal herbs.

386
00:13:06,896 --> 00:13:08,596
It gets very elegant...

387
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,065
by the end.

388
00:13:10,066 --> 00:13:11,365
They used medicinal herbs!

389
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:13,466
The scent is...

390
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:16,836
nice and subtle.

391
00:13:17,676 --> 00:13:19,905
- What's this in ssamjang? Peanuts?
- Nuts.

392
00:13:19,906 --> 00:13:22,316
(Their secret ssamjang is savorier, thanks to the peanuts.)

393
00:13:23,146 --> 00:13:26,816
(Now, let's eat the leaf wraps in earnest.)

394
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:28,756
Did you hear that?

395
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:30,585
It's so fresh.

396
00:13:30,586 --> 00:13:31,656
- The greens?
- I can tell!

397
00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:33,456
Yes.

398
00:13:33,556 --> 00:13:35,126
- Can I knock it off?
- Knock off what?

399
00:13:35,326 --> 00:13:36,425
Come on!

400
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:38,996
(Splashing)

401
00:13:39,626 --> 00:13:41,225
- I was wondering what he meant.
- He meant the greens.

402
00:13:41,226 --> 00:13:42,796
Oh, gosh.

403
00:13:42,836 --> 00:13:44,595
- You're supposed to do this!
- All right.

404
00:13:44,596 --> 00:13:46,305
- I need to shake the water off.
- You'll see what happens.

405
00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:47,465
I need to.

406
00:13:47,466 --> 00:13:49,775
Repeat after me. "Do you have chili and garlic?"

407
00:13:49,776 --> 00:13:51,576
- Say it.
- Do you have chili and garlic?

408
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:52,692
Louder.

409
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:54,546
Do you have chili and garlic?

410
00:13:55,046 --> 00:13:57,145
We don't have garlic, but we do have Cheongyang chili.

411
00:13:57,146 --> 00:13:58,945
- They have Cheongyang chili.
- "We'll have those."

412
00:13:58,946 --> 00:14:01,345
- We'll have those.
- Sure.

413
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:03,356
- "Thank you very much." - Thank you very much.

414
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:08,496
Why did I just do that?

415
00:14:08,996 --> 00:14:12,725
Do you normally try not to speak at restaurants?

416
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,896
If I stand out too much,

417
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:15,339
I look like a total fatty.

418
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,995
You know,

419
00:14:17,996 --> 00:14:20,935
when someone orders a bowl of rice,

420
00:14:20,936 --> 00:14:22,275
they put it in front of Se Yoon.

421
00:14:22,276 --> 00:14:23,735
(It's magical how all the food is served in front of Se Yoon.)

422
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:25,075
And he's conscious about that.

423
00:14:25,076 --> 00:14:26,945
Did I tell you that story? I got on a plane,

424
00:14:26,946 --> 00:14:28,775
- Yes.
- and as soon as I sat down,

425
00:14:28,776 --> 00:14:29,976
a flight attendant came to me and said,

426
00:14:30,476 --> 00:14:32,046
"Meals will be served after takeoff."

427
00:14:33,486 --> 00:14:35,155
- Seriously?
- No one even asked.

428
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:36,485
(It's rare to be told that.)

429
00:14:36,486 --> 00:14:38,486
- I was like...
- People are easily mistaken.

430
00:14:38,926 --> 00:14:40,825
- "Meals are served after takeoff." - It was a simple misunderstanding.

431
00:14:40,826 --> 00:14:42,596
- Indeed.
- Goodness.

432
00:14:42,656 --> 00:14:44,526
You can't really snap it.

433
00:14:46,026 --> 00:14:47,896
I've never tried three greens in one wrap before.

434
00:14:48,396 --> 00:14:49,736
I can't snap it.

435
00:14:51,906 --> 00:14:53,206
What else should I add to this?

436
00:14:54,136 --> 00:14:56,135
You can put everything into a leaf wrap.

437
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:57,936
- Even rice?
- That's a given!

438
00:14:59,176 --> 00:15:00,306
It's called leaf wraps and rice!

439
00:15:01,376 --> 00:15:03,146
- Why wouldn't you add rice?
- How about now?

440
00:15:03,616 --> 00:15:05,215
They don't have plain garlic. Why do you think that is?

441
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:06,346
They have pickled garlic.

442
00:15:06,446 --> 00:15:08,616
That means you're supposed to add this garlic.

443
00:15:08,956 --> 00:15:10,885
It's my first time putting multiple greens...

444
00:15:10,886 --> 00:15:12,456
- in a leaf wrap.
- Me too!

445
00:15:12,756 --> 00:15:14,356
I've never stacked them before.

446
00:15:14,656 --> 00:15:16,255
I saw Se Yoon stacking the leaves.

447
00:15:16,256 --> 00:15:18,165
- It tastes even better that way.
- What's this called?

448
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,295
No, it's not that.

449
00:15:19,296 --> 00:15:21,266
- It's too big for my mouth.
- It won't fit.

450
00:15:21,836 --> 00:15:24,595
He makes it nice. He spreads them out...

451
00:15:24,596 --> 00:15:26,235
- so there's more space.
- Yes.

452
00:15:26,236 --> 00:15:27,305
That way...

453
00:15:27,306 --> 00:15:28,676
Make it as neat as possible.

454
00:15:28,806 --> 00:15:31,275
Not everyone can do that. He's impressive.

455
00:15:31,276 --> 00:15:33,306
I've never seen that trick before.

456
00:15:33,776 --> 00:15:36,046
He spreads the rice as if he was making gimbap.

457
00:15:36,146 --> 00:15:38,445
- Like this.
- He does!

458
00:15:38,446 --> 00:15:40,545
- Isn't that too much rice?
- He makes great wraps.

459
00:15:40,546 --> 00:15:42,056
(A slice of meat on the spread-out rice)

460
00:15:43,316 --> 00:15:45,155
What was that fancy move?

461
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:46,686
I asked for chili,

462
00:15:47,426 --> 00:15:48,755
so I'll add this too.

463
00:15:48,756 --> 00:15:50,125
(Snapping a piece of chili off with his hand)

464
00:15:50,126 --> 00:15:52,066
- He's very dexterous.
- Yes.

465
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,365
Oh, my.

466
00:15:53,366 --> 00:15:55,166
(He puts it in his mouth as if it never existed.)

467
00:15:55,736 --> 00:15:58,406
(Impressed by the eating show in the front-row seats)

468
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,236
It's delicious.

469
00:16:02,476 --> 00:16:05,845
Let's maintain this satisfaction...

470
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:07,205
- and start the quiz.
- Sure.

471
00:16:07,206 --> 00:16:08,776
It's up to Se Yoon.

472
00:16:09,116 --> 00:16:10,416
You want to have a quiz when I only had three wraps?

473
00:16:11,376 --> 00:16:13,415
But you only have three slices of meat left.

474
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:14,416
I know, right?

475
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,955
Why don't you have...

476
00:16:16,956 --> 00:16:18,885
only one person try your signature wrap?

477
00:16:18,886 --> 00:16:20,325
- Great idea.
- I'm a little shy.

478
00:16:20,326 --> 00:16:22,325
- Will you order a plate of meat?
- Okay.

479
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:25,266
- Ma'am?
- We'll have another plate of meat.

480
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:27,496
And I need a bowl of rice right now.

481
00:16:27,726 --> 00:16:31,436
Se Yoon is certainly good at eating food deliciously.

482
00:16:32,206 --> 00:16:34,036
- The more I eat, the hungrier I am.
- Pardon?

483
00:16:34,406 --> 00:16:35,476
I came on an empty stomach.

484
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:38,846
- Se Yoon, put it closer to you.
- He makes it look so tasty.

485
00:16:38,876 --> 00:16:42,446
It's a pretty simple table. There's only one type of meat too.

486
00:16:42,776 --> 00:16:44,516
- And it's tasty enough.
- Yes.

487
00:16:45,786 --> 00:16:46,786
I'm full now.

488
00:16:48,256 --> 00:16:49,286
Already?

489
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:51,256
As soon as Se Yoon heard that,

490
00:16:51,516 --> 00:16:53,026
he was so shocked.

491
00:16:53,226 --> 00:16:55,426
Hey, what did you just say?

492
00:16:57,396 --> 00:16:59,065
I almost jumped up from my seat. What did you say?

493
00:16:59,066 --> 00:17:01,695
I meant that I felt full just by watching you eat.

494
00:17:01,696 --> 00:17:02,935
- Is that right?
- Thank you.

495
00:17:02,936 --> 00:17:05,435
- Thank you.
- It's well-proportioned this time.

496
00:17:05,436 --> 00:17:07,366
- Great.
- It looks amazing.

497
00:17:08,066 --> 00:17:09,076
I love it.

498
00:17:09,536 --> 00:17:11,806
This is just like bossam.

499
00:17:12,376 --> 00:17:15,446
- Let's have a simple quiz.
- Okay.

500
00:17:15,546 --> 00:17:16,745
How about a proverb?

501
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:17,876
Great.

502
00:17:18,216 --> 00:17:19,886
- I'm dying to try a leaf wrap.
- Here it goes.

503
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:23,016
Losing a tooth while eating this.

504
00:17:24,816 --> 00:17:26,385
- That's so obvious.
- Okay.

505
00:17:26,386 --> 00:17:28,086
- Dong Hyun. I got it.
- Okay.

506
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:29,226
- Cartilage?
- Taffy.

507
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:30,696
Taffy? Incorrect.

508
00:17:32,196 --> 00:17:34,326
But that makes sense. It doesn't sound like a proverb.

509
00:17:34,696 --> 00:17:35,936
A proverb is supposed to make sense.

510
00:17:36,396 --> 00:17:38,905
It must be ironic. Maybe something soft?

511
00:17:38,906 --> 00:17:40,236
Oh, that must be it.

512
00:17:40,806 --> 00:17:42,505
- Soft food.
- Soft food?

513
00:17:42,506 --> 00:17:43,735
(Soft food?)

514
00:17:43,736 --> 00:17:46,046
I got it. Sweet red bean jelly.

515
00:17:46,146 --> 00:17:46,727
- Sweet red bean jelly?
- No way.

516
00:17:47,276 --> 00:17:48,276
Incorrect.

517
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:49,815
I got it. Tofu.

518
00:17:49,816 --> 00:17:50,976
Tofu?

519
00:17:51,616 --> 00:17:53,015
- It's wrong.
- Correct.

520
00:17:53,016 --> 00:17:54,216
(Answer: Tofu)

521
00:17:54,241 --> 00:17:54,997
Correct.

522
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:57,216
- Seriously?
- Are you serious?

523
00:17:57,756 --> 00:17:59,286
(Seriously?)

524
00:17:59,456 --> 00:18:00,885
No way. Are you sure?

525
00:18:00,886 --> 00:18:01,925
That was fast.

526
00:18:01,926 --> 00:18:03,056
It's not a proverb from another country?

527
00:18:04,026 --> 00:18:05,126
"From another country."

528
00:18:05,926 --> 00:18:07,725
- That was speedy.
- Is that the wrap for him?

529
00:18:07,726 --> 00:18:08,736
It is.

530
00:18:08,866 --> 00:18:10,966
(He places angelica tree leaves on top of lettuce.)

531
00:18:11,236 --> 00:18:13,935
It has to be one bite.

532
00:18:13,936 --> 00:18:15,575
(Rice, meat, sliced green onions,)

533
00:18:15,576 --> 00:18:17,076
(and pickled garlic)

534
00:18:17,136 --> 00:18:20,075
Is there anything else you want? Maybe chili?

535
00:18:20,076 --> 00:18:21,245
One more slice of meat, please.

536
00:18:21,246 --> 00:18:23,046
More meat? Sure. I like your enthusiasm.

537
00:18:23,616 --> 00:18:26,316
(Adding another slice of meat as the client ordered)

538
00:18:26,646 --> 00:18:28,086
- I'll give it to you now.
- Okay.

539
00:18:28,386 --> 00:18:30,116
Do you want me to open your mouth?

540
00:18:30,756 --> 00:18:31,985
- No, thanks.
- No?

541
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,186
- Here it goes.
- Okay.

542
00:18:34,056 --> 00:18:35,495
One, two. Go!

543
00:18:35,496 --> 00:18:37,555
(Here's a leaf wrap that's as big as a fist.)

544
00:18:37,556 --> 00:18:38,596
You need to grab it. There you go.

545
00:18:39,596 --> 00:18:40,596
There you go!

546
00:18:40,966 --> 00:18:41,995
Great.

547
00:18:41,996 --> 00:18:43,165
(Se Yoon's wrap fills Sang Uk's mouth to the full.)

548
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:44,166
Gosh.

549
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,166
That's the right way to eat leaf wraps.

550
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:46,166
As if your mouth was about to pop open.

551
00:18:46,606 --> 00:18:47,866
Like your mouth will pop open.

552
00:18:48,676 --> 00:18:50,135
- The meat is...
- I know.

553
00:18:50,136 --> 00:18:52,806
I saw how he only picked the nice-looking meat for you.

554
00:18:52,946 --> 00:18:54,346
This meat kind of tastes...

555
00:18:54,646 --> 00:18:57,976
- like delicious bossam.
- It's insane, right?

556
00:18:58,276 --> 00:19:00,945
I'll make a combo with kimchi.

557
00:19:00,946 --> 00:19:02,085
Your sungnyung looks nice too.

558
00:19:02,086 --> 00:19:03,115
(Making a combo with kimchi)

559
00:19:03,116 --> 00:19:04,785
- He turned it into a combo.
- Unbelievable.

560
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:06,126
It'll taste better this way.

561
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:07,855
- Like this.
- Did you cover it with a leaf?

562
00:19:07,856 --> 00:19:08,926
Go like this.

563
00:19:10,856 --> 00:19:12,966
- He didn't spill anything.
- Your mouth is huge.

564
00:19:15,266 --> 00:19:17,266
- His mouth is very spacious.
- He covered it from above.

565
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:19,606
He put half a bowl of rice just now.

566
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:22,075
- It's very spacious.
- And a bite of chili.

567
00:19:22,076 --> 00:19:23,105
Isn't it spicy?

568
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:24,435
(Finishing it with a bite of Cheongyang chili)

569
00:19:24,436 --> 00:19:26,546
- Isn't it too spicy?
- That was cool.

570
00:19:27,146 --> 00:19:29,216
Now, I go to nurungji. You already ate yours?

571
00:19:29,576 --> 00:19:30,616
We're done eating.

572
00:19:31,716 --> 00:19:32,716
(Dumbfounded)

573
00:19:32,717 --> 00:19:33,945
That's what happens...

574
00:19:33,946 --> 00:19:36,555
- I finished it before he caught me.
- when you eat with them.

575
00:19:36,556 --> 00:19:37,985
(Their eating capacity was way too disappointing for him.)

576
00:19:37,986 --> 00:19:40,055
- Are you for real?
- Se Yoon could eat...

577
00:19:40,056 --> 00:19:42,496
another bowl of rice and another plate of meat.

578
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:44,596
Don't mind us.

579
00:19:44,826 --> 00:19:45,826
This is the vibe.

580
00:19:46,196 --> 00:19:47,596
I checked the itinerary today,

581
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:49,595
and there was a two-hour break...

582
00:19:49,596 --> 00:19:50,866
- after the meal.
- That's true.

583
00:19:51,066 --> 00:19:52,136
Why are you guys taking breaks?

584
00:19:53,206 --> 00:19:54,705
- Why?
- I know, right?

585
00:19:54,706 --> 00:19:56,405
- Why?
- Tell me about it.

586
00:19:56,406 --> 00:19:57,776
Why take a break if that's all you're going to eat?

587
00:19:58,606 --> 00:20:00,046
- We just...
- Do you go to Internet cafes?

588
00:20:01,846 --> 00:20:04,146
It's just that I don't understand. Please explain.

589
00:20:04,646 --> 00:20:06,316
Why do you take a two-hour break if that's all you're eating?

590
00:20:06,816 --> 00:20:07,916
I'm being serious.

591
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:11,256
I was shocked by how quietly they ate their nurungji.

592
00:20:11,356 --> 00:20:12,486
We're finished.

593
00:20:12,726 --> 00:20:14,355
When you're eating nurungji,

594
00:20:14,356 --> 00:20:16,326
it's the endgame of your meal.

595
00:20:16,856 --> 00:20:19,695
In our culture, people eat nurungji as dessert.

596
00:20:19,696 --> 00:20:20,966
We need to highlight that part.

597
00:20:21,266 --> 00:20:23,596
Westerners eat cake, but we go back to rice.

598
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:25,566
(Laughing)

599
00:20:25,567 --> 00:20:26,705
You go back?

600
00:20:26,706 --> 00:20:28,935
- The great Koreans.
- Is that so?

601
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,175
Name a country on Earth...

602
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:32,305
- that eats nurungji as dessert.
- Sungnyung.

603
00:20:32,306 --> 00:20:34,276
You just had rice, and you get rice as dessert.

604
00:20:34,906 --> 00:20:36,145
- He's right, you know.
- After we eat rice, we finish...

605
00:20:36,146 --> 00:20:37,845
- the meal with fried rice.
- He has a point.

606
00:20:37,846 --> 00:20:39,985
We need to let the world know about these great people.

607
00:20:39,986 --> 00:20:41,246
- He has a point.
- Yes.

608
00:20:41,386 --> 00:20:42,486
"Very rice!"

609
00:20:43,656 --> 00:20:44,656
"Very rice."

610
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:47,826
(His eating show still hasn't ended.)

611
00:20:50,196 --> 00:20:52,666
Does it say, "One more time," on the back?

612
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:54,925
- No?
- Gosh.

613
00:20:54,926 --> 00:20:56,295
- It's a dud.
- Come on, guys!

614
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:57,335
(It's a dud?)

615
00:20:57,336 --> 00:20:58,366
Director.

616
00:20:58,866 --> 00:21:00,766
You should have written, "One more bowl."

617
00:21:02,076 --> 00:21:05,075
That's something that only Se Yoon can think of.

618
00:21:05,076 --> 00:21:06,305
Like, "One more bottle."

619
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:07,375
I should see a sign that says,

620
00:21:07,376 --> 00:21:08,715
"More boiled pork," when I clean the pot.

621
00:21:08,716 --> 00:21:10,115
On the bottom?

622
00:21:10,116 --> 00:21:12,215
- On the bottom of the pot.
- Yes.

623
00:21:12,216 --> 00:21:13,446
(He still wants more.)

624
00:21:13,616 --> 00:21:16,686
That's all he thinks of. He thinks about food all day.

625
00:21:17,256 --> 00:21:19,955
This might be the smallest bill ever...

626
00:21:19,956 --> 00:21:21,025
for Se Yoon.

627
00:21:21,026 --> 00:21:22,226
Well, he didn't eat as much.

628
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:24,295
- It's 92 dollars.
- Perfect.

629
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:25,296
It's 92 dollars?

630
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:26,296
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

631
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:28,066
- A quiz about leaf wraps and rice.
- Okay.

632
00:21:28,396 --> 00:21:31,096
During the late Joseon dynasty, the Silhak scholar Lee Deok Mu...

633
00:21:31,336 --> 00:21:32,336
This one's tricky.

634
00:21:32,337 --> 00:21:34,165
wrote in "A Guide to Everyday Etiquette..."

635
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:36,706
about how to eat lettuce wraps with grace.

636
00:21:36,736 --> 00:21:38,575
He advised not to place the lettuce on one's palm,

637
00:21:38,576 --> 00:21:39,645
as it could appear unclean.

638
00:21:39,646 --> 00:21:43,075
Instead, one should scoop rice with a spoon, place it on the bowl,

639
00:21:43,076 --> 00:21:45,175
then lift a lettuce leaf with chopsticks,

640
00:21:45,176 --> 00:21:46,686
wrap the rice in it,

641
00:21:46,716 --> 00:21:49,656
and bring it to the mouth, followed by a bite of doenjang.

642
00:21:50,216 --> 00:21:52,155
Also, he warned against making wraps...

643
00:21:52,156 --> 00:21:54,286
"this big," implying not to overdo it.

644
00:21:54,356 --> 00:21:56,225
- "How big is "this big?" - "This big?"

645
00:21:56,226 --> 00:21:57,496
That's a very difficult quiz.

646
00:21:57,696 --> 00:21:58,765
- Yes.
- I...

647
00:21:58,766 --> 00:22:01,295
Is it something like, "Until your cheeks bulge out?"

648
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:02,296
I guess so.

649
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,695
I have no clue.

650
00:22:03,696 --> 00:22:04,765
Se Yoon has to guess it.

651
00:22:04,766 --> 00:22:07,106
I don't even have a joke about it. There's nothing in my head.

652
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:08,336
Glucose spike!

653
00:22:08,466 --> 00:22:10,935
- He's feeling it now.
- No!

654
00:22:10,936 --> 00:22:12,575
- You can't feel it already.
- He's feeling the spike.

655
00:22:12,576 --> 00:22:13,675
It's too soon!

656
00:22:13,676 --> 00:22:14,845
(Here it comes)

657
00:22:14,846 --> 00:22:16,775
(My glucose level is increasing)

658
00:22:16,776 --> 00:22:18,215
(Here it comes)

659
00:22:18,216 --> 00:22:19,385
(My glucose level is increasing)

660
00:22:19,386 --> 00:22:23,015
"Until you choke?"

661
00:22:23,016 --> 00:22:25,885
- That doesn't sound so bad.
- When you put it in...

662
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,485
Or it's like, "So big that it touches your uvula."

663
00:22:27,486 --> 00:22:29,595
I doubt it's that detailed.

664
00:22:29,596 --> 00:22:30,926
What would you have me do, then?

665
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:34,426
- You don't know the answer either.
- I don't.

666
00:22:34,926 --> 00:22:36,196
We need to guess now.

667
00:22:36,366 --> 00:22:38,496
Or it's a simple answer.

668
00:22:39,536 --> 00:22:40,635
Your cheeks...

669
00:22:40,636 --> 00:22:41,665
(Tae Hyun tries to guess the answer from the image of eating.)

670
00:22:41,666 --> 00:22:43,705
- are protruding.
- Your cheeks are protruding?

671
00:22:43,706 --> 00:22:45,236
You know, it's...

672
00:22:46,276 --> 00:22:48,946
- You're a guest, so here's a hint.
- It's only for the guests.

673
00:22:49,976 --> 00:22:51,546
(Scoffing)

674
00:22:53,416 --> 00:22:54,846
The answer is "Like Moon Se Yoon?"

675
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:58,515
(I got you.)

676
00:22:58,516 --> 00:23:00,325
Or it's simply, "Like a pig?"

677
00:23:00,326 --> 00:23:02,196
(If that's the hint...)

678
00:23:02,396 --> 00:23:04,056
How did you come to that conclusion?

679
00:23:04,356 --> 00:23:05,896
You're on the same team.

680
00:23:07,296 --> 00:23:08,426
Hello, is this Kim Joon Hyun?

681
00:23:09,366 --> 00:23:10,596
Yes, bring some pigs over here.

682
00:23:11,366 --> 00:23:13,066
We're taking over this place.

683
00:23:13,436 --> 00:23:14,866
They're degrading fatties! Get here now.

684
00:23:15,676 --> 00:23:19,846
Why would you come on all fours? Just walk with two legs.

685
00:23:24,676 --> 00:23:26,346
He was about to come here on all fours.

686
00:23:27,016 --> 00:23:30,515
(Feeling dizzy)

687
00:23:30,516 --> 00:23:31,956
Yes, that's what he said!

688
00:23:34,386 --> 00:23:36,326
- He should only use his two legs.
- That's hilarious.

689
00:23:37,126 --> 00:23:39,296
Like, "Is that true?"

690
00:23:40,826 --> 00:23:42,595
And he'd run here excitedly.

691
00:23:42,596 --> 00:23:44,495
- I like that answer.
- Do you?

692
00:23:44,496 --> 00:23:45,536
Good answer.

693
00:23:46,206 --> 00:23:47,565
Good answer.

694
00:23:47,566 --> 00:23:48,675
(Well, I like Se Yoon.)

695
00:23:48,676 --> 00:23:51,075
He's an elegant scholar from the old days.

696
00:23:51,076 --> 00:23:52,145
"Until you can't chew it."

697
00:23:52,146 --> 00:23:53,575
They could have just eaten it,

698
00:23:53,576 --> 00:23:55,776
- but they tried to eat with grace.
- Yes.

699
00:23:56,276 --> 00:23:58,415
So, it's the worst if you show your teeth or uvula.

700
00:23:58,416 --> 00:23:59,745
- Then...
- Way back in the day.

701
00:23:59,746 --> 00:24:02,816
"Lord Lee, let's have a leaf wrap together."

702
00:24:03,286 --> 00:24:04,915
(Small-mouthed)

703
00:24:04,916 --> 00:24:06,056
So that the other person can't see it.

704
00:24:06,326 --> 00:24:08,255
(Laughing hysterically)

705
00:24:08,256 --> 00:24:09,726
- "Don't let them see it." - It sounds good to me.

706
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,496
That's not bad.

707
00:24:11,497 --> 00:24:12,865
I like that answer.

708
00:24:12,866 --> 00:24:14,165
(Is that the correct answer?)

709
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:16,335
- If I eat like this...
- Showing your uvula is...

710
00:24:16,336 --> 00:24:17,366
considered vulgar.

711
00:24:17,436 --> 00:24:18,705
You can't let them see your uvula.

712
00:24:18,706 --> 00:24:20,105
Yes, they tell you not to show your uvula when you laugh.

713
00:24:20,106 --> 00:24:21,165
- They do.
- Yes.

714
00:24:21,166 --> 00:24:22,375
People can see your throat when you laugh too hard.

715
00:24:22,376 --> 00:24:23,536
Let's go with "uvula," then.

716
00:24:23,706 --> 00:24:25,176
"Don't make it so big..."

717
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:27,706
- "that your uvula shows." - "Don't make it too big."

718
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:29,715
If this is the correct answer, give me 50 dollars each.

719
00:24:29,716 --> 00:24:31,015
I deserve it.

720
00:24:31,016 --> 00:24:32,385
"Don't make wraps so big..."

721
00:24:32,386 --> 00:24:33,546
"that they can see your uvula?"

722
00:24:34,329 --> 00:24:35,669
"Don't make it so big..."

723
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,329
- "that your uvula shows." - "Don't make it too big."

724
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,298
If this is the correct answer, give me 50 dollars each.

725
00:24:40,299 --> 00:24:41,668
I deserve it.

726
00:24:41,669 --> 00:24:42,968
"Don't make wraps so big..."

727
00:24:42,969 --> 00:24:44,239
"that they can see your uvula?"

728
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:45,459
It's incorrect.

729
00:24:47,179 --> 00:24:48,208
That's hard.

730
00:24:48,209 --> 00:24:51,279
(You're my ideal type)

731
00:24:52,249 --> 00:24:55,589
(You're my Lee Yi Kyung)

732
00:24:56,219 --> 00:24:59,089
(You only say the incorrect answers)

733
00:24:59,489 --> 00:25:01,489
(Like this)

734
00:25:02,329 --> 00:25:03,889
Do we guess individually now?

735
00:25:03,959 --> 00:25:05,928
- For the same quiz?
- We play individually now?

736
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:07,929
- With the same quiz?
- Then, it's a speed quiz.

737
00:25:08,199 --> 00:25:09,299
I got it.

738
00:25:10,629 --> 00:25:12,298
"Until you spill the food."

739
00:25:12,299 --> 00:25:13,369
"Until you spill the food?"

740
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:14,799
Incorrect.

741
00:25:14,869 --> 00:25:16,409
"Until your spoon bends."

742
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:19,878
Like Uri Geller?

743
00:25:19,879 --> 00:25:20,909
- Yes.
- Incorrect.

744
00:25:21,439 --> 00:25:23,509
- "Until you frown." - Incorrect.

745
00:25:23,749 --> 00:25:25,209
"Until you get greens stuck between your teeth?"

746
00:25:25,749 --> 00:25:26,779
Incorrect.

747
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:29,119
I got it. "Until you dislocate your jaws."

748
00:25:29,219 --> 00:25:31,218
- That was so funny.
- "Dislocate your jaws."

749
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:32,219
Incorrect.

750
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,689
- I got it!
- Okay.

751
00:25:33,889 --> 00:25:35,088
"Until you dislocate your jaws."

752
00:25:35,089 --> 00:25:36,128
- I said that.
- He just did.

753
00:25:36,129 --> 00:25:37,259
Why did you say it so quietly?

754
00:25:37,659 --> 00:25:38,899
Why did you?

755
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:40,829
Why?

756
00:25:41,129 --> 00:25:42,599
Tae Hyun, you're a huge disappointment today.

757
00:25:43,369 --> 00:25:44,729
Why do you speak so quietly?

758
00:25:44,969 --> 00:25:46,098
- Gosh.
- He said it?

759
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:47,368
- Can I give you a hint?
- Yes.

760
00:25:47,369 --> 00:25:48,738
I'll make it short.

761
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:49,838
(Hint)

762
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,868
It's cute.

763
00:25:50,869 --> 00:25:52,338
(The hint is that it's cute.)

764
00:25:52,339 --> 00:25:53,479
- It's cute?
- It's cute?

765
00:25:53,979 --> 00:25:55,649
Among the three of you,

766
00:25:55,909 --> 00:25:57,008
Who's the cutest?

767
00:25:57,009 --> 00:25:59,119
- I think Se Yoon is the cutest.
- Is that right?

768
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:00,978
Take a look at your faces.

769
00:26:00,979 --> 00:26:02,448
(Staring)

770
00:26:02,449 --> 00:26:04,789
Se Yoon! "Until your cheeks puff out."

771
00:26:04,949 --> 00:26:05,989
Correct!

772
00:26:06,719 --> 00:26:07,758
Yes!

773
00:26:07,759 --> 00:26:10,528
(Se Yoon is off the hook from the first restaurant.)

774
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:12,028
Why did you add contour to your face?

775
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,698
I said earlier...

776
00:26:13,699 --> 00:26:15,058
(My cheeks are the puffiest.)

777
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:16,328
He's so happy.

778
00:26:16,329 --> 00:26:18,028
- He's so happy.
- "Until your cheeks puff out."

779
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:19,199
He's genuinely happy about it.

780
00:26:19,639 --> 00:26:21,098
You give great hints.

781
00:26:21,099 --> 00:26:22,539
Se Yoon is so happy.

782
00:26:23,139 --> 00:26:24,368
- Okay.
- Was the hint too good?

783
00:26:24,369 --> 00:26:25,739
Joon Hyun, no need to come here. Go back.

784
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:27,839
Yes, I saved my money. Bye.

785
00:26:28,239 --> 00:26:29,948
Stop saying, "Oink."

786
00:26:29,949 --> 00:26:32,079
(Stop saying, "Oink.")

787
00:26:33,519 --> 00:26:35,989
(Laughing)

788
00:26:36,589 --> 00:26:38,188
(Se Yoon will not pay for the leaf wraps and rice.)

789
00:26:38,189 --> 00:26:39,559
I was hoping Se Yoon would lose.

790
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:41,988
- We'll have a proverb quiz.
- Yes, sir.

791
00:26:41,989 --> 00:26:43,429
Let's make it quick.

792
00:26:43,589 --> 00:26:45,959
"Those who speak the truth aren't 'this.'"

793
00:26:46,599 --> 00:26:47,829
I got it. "Complimented?"

794
00:26:47,899 --> 00:26:48,999
That is incorrect.

795
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:51,169
- "Those who speak the truth..." - "Paid fully."

796
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:53,239
- Incorrect.
- That's the same thing.

797
00:26:53,569 --> 00:26:55,138
- I got it. "Appreciated." - What's that?

798
00:26:55,139 --> 00:26:56,208
Let me see that.

799
00:26:56,209 --> 00:26:57,539
(Checking the answer first)

800
00:26:59,509 --> 00:27:00,639
How long is the word?

801
00:27:01,109 --> 00:27:02,779
- Six letters?
- Six letters.

802
00:27:03,349 --> 00:27:05,109
Do you want a facial hint?

803
00:27:06,819 --> 00:27:08,048
That's acting cute.

804
00:27:08,049 --> 00:27:09,149
(Acting adorable)

805
00:27:10,289 --> 00:27:11,349
"Adored!"

806
00:27:12,719 --> 00:27:13,919
- Correct.
- What?

807
00:27:14,189 --> 00:27:15,289
- The answer was "adored?" - It was "adored?"

808
00:27:15,589 --> 00:27:16,958
"Those who speak the truth..."

809
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,189
"aren't adored."

810
00:27:18,859 --> 00:27:19,899
Exactly.

811
00:27:20,199 --> 00:27:21,298
When a junior flatters you,

812
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:22,769
- they're adored.
- I see.

813
00:27:23,469 --> 00:27:24,499
Thanks for the food, Tae Hyun.

814
00:27:24,629 --> 00:27:26,268
- Thank you.
- All right.

815
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,399
Let's go and eat black goat hot pot.

816
00:27:27,769 --> 00:27:29,069
Okay.

817
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:30,639
All right.

818
00:27:32,809 --> 00:27:34,679
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you.

819
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:37,949
(They finished a healthy meal at the leaf wrap place.)

820
00:27:39,079 --> 00:27:43,319
(A summertime stamina food we crave when the sun starts to scorch)

821
00:27:44,389 --> 00:27:47,689
(LMR 2: Black goat hot pot)

822
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,359
- That aura...
- Black goat hot pot.

823
00:27:50,729 --> 00:27:52,528
- It obviously looks...
- The name of the place is...

824
00:27:52,529 --> 00:27:53,798
It's just "Black Goat."

825
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,598
No, there's "Nutritious."

826
00:27:55,599 --> 00:27:56,599
Exactly.

827
00:27:57,499 --> 00:27:58,629
This place is the real deal.

828
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:01,369
Oh, it's my favorite thing! That's my dream.

829
00:28:01,769 --> 00:28:03,439
I should take a photo.

830
00:28:03,569 --> 00:28:05,169
- There's chili.
- Chili.

831
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:07,279
- Its flower blossomed.
- That's my dream.

832
00:28:07,379 --> 00:28:09,278
- It's not even a leaf wrap place.
- I wish I could live here.

833
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:10,448
They look so fresh.

834
00:28:10,449 --> 00:28:11,778
- It's my dream.
- This place...

835
00:28:11,779 --> 00:28:13,419
looks more like a leaf wrap place.

836
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:15,078
Just looking at it makes me happy.

837
00:28:15,079 --> 00:28:16,619
What is that?

838
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:19,519
- What is that?
- Even the view looks tasty.

839
00:28:19,789 --> 00:28:21,159
It's so...

840
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:22,658
I made a great choice.

841
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,628
It's a house for noblemen from Joseon. Let's head inside.

842
00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:26,299
- Dong Hyun is so glad.
- How dare you?

843
00:28:26,499 --> 00:28:28,259
"Come hither!"

844
00:28:29,669 --> 00:28:31,268
(At the foot of Mount Bukhan is...)

845
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:33,399
(a hanok restaurant steeped in old-world charm.)

846
00:28:33,899 --> 00:28:36,809
(The tranquil atmosphere invites you in.)

847
00:28:37,139 --> 00:28:41,779
(Prepared strictly in the traditional way,)

848
00:28:42,239 --> 00:28:47,479
(their black goat dishes are refined and flavorful.)

849
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:50,118
(This place always bustles with customers...)

850
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:52,359
(in search of stamina food.)

851
00:28:52,759 --> 00:28:55,118
I thought it was about time I felt invigorated.

852
00:28:55,119 --> 00:28:56,629
Their meat isn't gamey at all.

853
00:28:57,429 --> 00:28:58,758
Especially for me,

854
00:28:58,759 --> 00:29:01,759
I really love this sauce.

855
00:29:02,599 --> 00:29:04,199
It's made of perilla seeds.

856
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,538
Dip the meat into the sauce.

857
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:07,938
(It tastes great when you dip the meat into the sauce.)

858
00:29:07,939 --> 00:29:10,139
It tastes amazing to me.

859
00:29:11,509 --> 00:29:14,638
(LMR 2: Black goat hot pot)

860
00:29:14,639 --> 00:29:15,748
We've been starving for too long,

861
00:29:15,749 --> 00:29:17,078
so we'll order the food first.

862
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,349
Ask her like a black goat would.

863
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:20,079
Ma'am!

864
00:29:21,249 --> 00:29:23,019
He's such a nice guy.

865
00:29:23,349 --> 00:29:25,148
- Hello.
- Hello.

866
00:29:25,149 --> 00:29:26,188
It's a pleasure.

867
00:29:26,189 --> 00:29:28,859
I have a feeling that she's a master.

868
00:29:29,129 --> 00:29:31,258
- How long have you run the place?
- For 40 years.

869
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:32,328
- Forty years?
- Yes.

870
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:33,458
- Right in this building?
- Yes.

871
00:29:33,459 --> 00:29:34,798
(The owner, Lim Ok Ja)

872
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,469
May I ask you how old you are?

873
00:29:37,629 --> 00:29:38,729
I was born in 1940.

874
00:29:40,499 --> 00:29:42,538
- Really?
- I'm 86.

875
00:29:42,539 --> 00:29:43,708
You're 86?

876
00:29:43,709 --> 00:29:45,138
(Oh, my gosh)

877
00:29:45,139 --> 00:29:47,009
Is it because you often had black goat dishes?

878
00:29:47,539 --> 00:29:50,779
I had to taste the food, so...

879
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,119
You look incredibly young.

880
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:56,089
Do you cook black goat rather unusually here?

881
00:29:56,349 --> 00:29:58,519
Other restaurants usually boil the meat.

882
00:29:58,719 --> 00:30:00,158
But we stick to the traditional texts...

883
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,589
and steam them.

884
00:30:01,989 --> 00:30:04,088
Because they also steamed them in the steamer.

885
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:05,689
(They steam the meat, just like in the traditional texts.)

886
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:06,958
Only the people of high status...

887
00:30:06,959 --> 00:30:09,228
could have eaten it since the Goryeo Dynasty.

888
00:30:09,229 --> 00:30:10,769
- Do you mean black goat?
- Really?

889
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:13,369
The three of us are going to eat.

890
00:30:13,639 --> 00:30:15,368
What should we order?

891
00:30:15,369 --> 00:30:17,838
You should try the boiled goat first.

892
00:30:17,839 --> 00:30:19,038
- That's right.
- Yes.

893
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,338
Then, you can eat...

894
00:30:20,339 --> 00:30:22,609
- It's just like you said.
- our stone chicken soup.

895
00:30:22,709 --> 00:30:23,709
- Chicken soup?
- Chicken soup?

896
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:26,079
Stone chicken soup. We only use natural ingredients,

897
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:28,048
such as perilla seeds.

898
00:30:28,049 --> 00:30:29,718
Then, you can have the hot pot.

899
00:30:29,719 --> 00:30:30,788
It's a full-course meal.

900
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:32,788
We'll take your advice. Boiled goat,

901
00:30:32,789 --> 00:30:34,858
chicken soup and hot pot.

902
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:35,859
Sure.

903
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,328
- Thank you.
- I hope you enjoy the food.

904
00:30:37,329 --> 00:30:38,988
- Well, I can't eat, so...
- Thank you.

905
00:30:38,989 --> 00:30:40,228
- It's so interesting.
- Indeed.

906
00:30:40,229 --> 00:30:42,129
They must catch the goat too.

907
00:30:42,199 --> 00:30:44,468
The sauce looks insanely good.

908
00:30:44,469 --> 00:30:45,529
- The sauce.
- The sauce.

909
00:30:46,199 --> 00:30:47,769
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Exactly.

910
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,709
(This restaurant's highlight is the perilla oil sauce.)

911
00:30:52,609 --> 00:30:54,478
- It's so...
- That smell...

912
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:55,779
It's perilla oil.

913
00:30:56,409 --> 00:30:58,048
(Exhaling sharply)

914
00:30:58,049 --> 00:30:59,118
Do you regret it?

915
00:30:59,119 --> 00:31:00,918
That dongchimi soup would be perfect...

916
00:31:00,919 --> 00:31:02,249
on a hot day like this.

917
00:31:03,549 --> 00:31:04,618
Dongchimi!

918
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:06,018
(Cold dongchimi soup is a must in summertime.)

919
00:31:06,019 --> 00:31:07,259
Yes, on a day like this.

920
00:31:08,619 --> 00:31:10,588
(Exclaiming)

921
00:31:10,589 --> 00:31:11,888
Yes, on a day like this.

922
00:31:11,889 --> 00:31:13,099
(Dongchimi tastes the best when it's scorching outside.)

923
00:31:13,859 --> 00:31:15,628
That dongchimi looks sexy.

924
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:16,999
(Sexy food in the summer, dongchimi)

925
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:19,699
(He has a hard time holding back when there are only side dishes.)

926
00:31:19,939 --> 00:31:21,939
- Here's your boiled black goat.
- Here it is.

927
00:31:22,099 --> 00:31:23,268
That boiled meat...

928
00:31:23,269 --> 00:31:26,179
Yes, that's what I'm talking about.

929
00:31:26,739 --> 00:31:28,278
- Perilla leaves?
- Perilla leaves...

930
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:29,448
- Chives?
- and chives.

931
00:31:29,449 --> 00:31:31,378
Try the meat with them.

932
00:31:31,379 --> 00:31:33,019
(Chewy boiled goat with steamed vegetables)

933
00:31:33,549 --> 00:31:35,279
(Every morning, fresh black goat meat is...)

934
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:38,989
(coated with doenjang to remove any gamey odor.)

935
00:31:39,589 --> 00:31:42,689
(She carefully layers the meat in a large pot...)

936
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:46,429
(and steams it for two and a half hours.)

937
00:31:46,999 --> 00:31:49,128
(As a result, you get perfectly cooked black goat meat...)

938
00:31:49,129 --> 00:31:51,299
(with no trace of gamey smell.)

939
00:31:51,869 --> 00:31:56,269
(Cut the meat into bite-sized pieces and mix with a secret house sauce.)

940
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:03,849
(Then, steam it once more for 20 minutes,)

941
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:10,019
(and you get chewy slices of boiled goat with a clean flavor.)

942
00:32:10,689 --> 00:32:12,958
(Clapping)

943
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:13,959
That should do it.

944
00:32:13,959 --> 00:32:14,959
(This is it.)

945
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,528
- I'm so happy.
- What's this?

946
00:32:16,529 --> 00:32:17,928
- Boiled goat.
- I didn't know it could look so...

947
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:19,259
Yes, that's what I was picturing.

948
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:21,159
- Okay.
- No way!

949
00:32:21,499 --> 00:32:22,698
It's nothing like I've ever seen.

950
00:32:22,699 --> 00:32:24,169
I'm sorry, but can we get a demonstration?

951
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:25,799
Yes, show us how to eat it properly.

952
00:32:26,139 --> 00:32:27,899
- How should we eat it?
- Chives and perilla leaves.

953
00:32:28,669 --> 00:32:29,708
Boiled meat.

954
00:32:29,709 --> 00:32:31,038
One slice of meat?

955
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:32,208
I need at least two.

956
00:32:32,209 --> 00:32:34,378
- It tastes better with one slice.
- Okay.

957
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:36,349
- Everything in moderation.
- In moderation.

958
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:38,609
- And we dip it in the sauce?
- Yes.

959
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:40,418
- Like this?
- Dip it.

960
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:41,778
You've never had boiled goat before?

961
00:32:41,779 --> 00:32:43,549
(He wraps it in the greens and dips it in the sauce.)

962
00:32:43,989 --> 00:32:46,619
- This is the perfect moment.
- It smells amazing.

963
00:32:47,959 --> 00:32:48,959
It must be good.

964
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,789
(The more they chew, the more they're impressed.)

965
00:32:51,789 --> 00:32:53,028
- It's too good.
- Is it?

966
00:32:53,029 --> 00:32:54,129
I can't even imagine what it's like.

967
00:32:54,629 --> 00:32:55,629
This is the perfect moment.

968
00:32:55,999 --> 00:32:57,229
It smells amazing.

969
00:32:58,599 --> 00:32:59,669
It must be good.

970
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:03,468
- It's too good.
- Is it?

971
00:33:03,469 --> 00:33:04,539
I can't even imagine what it's like.

972
00:33:07,939 --> 00:33:09,038
It's so good.

973
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:10,248
Don't you need anything else?

974
00:33:10,249 --> 00:33:11,679
- This is crazy.
- Really?

975
00:33:12,079 --> 00:33:13,879
I can't even imagine the flavors. How is it? Is it just like meat?

976
00:33:14,219 --> 00:33:16,318
- It looks like jangjorim.
- Yes, tender jangjorim.

977
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:18,918
- The kind your mom just made.
- Right.

978
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:20,518
That's how the meat breaks up in your mouth.

979
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,288
(A masterful texture that is both tender and bouncy)

980
00:33:22,289 --> 00:33:24,328
As you know, beef tastes like beef,

981
00:33:24,329 --> 00:33:26,229
and pork tastes like pork.

982
00:33:26,459 --> 00:33:29,968
You'd think black goat meat would taste like black goat.

983
00:33:29,969 --> 00:33:31,199
However,

984
00:33:31,469 --> 00:33:34,399
there's no gamey odor or anything like that.

985
00:33:34,699 --> 00:33:36,239
That's a good idea. Enjoy the mist.

986
00:33:36,539 --> 00:33:38,209
Let your skin absorb the moisture.

987
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:40,009
- This...
- It's insane.

988
00:33:42,509 --> 00:33:43,749
(Breathing in the smell)

989
00:33:43,779 --> 00:33:45,079
You can smell it this way.

990
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:47,949
You can. I'm not lying.

991
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:49,889
Isn't this the smell of your cooked hand?

992
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:51,448
Wait, I can smell it.

993
00:33:51,449 --> 00:33:52,718
(His advanced technique also allows him to make deliveries.)

994
00:33:52,719 --> 00:33:53,758
You can smell it this way.

995
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:55,719
I'm not kidding.

996
00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:58,589
Who knew boiled goat meat was this delicious?

997
00:33:58,759 --> 00:34:01,159
(Enjoying boiled goat meat with water parsley and chives)

998
00:34:01,259 --> 00:34:02,698
(Rocking side to side)

999
00:34:02,699 --> 00:34:03,929
This is crazy.

1000
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,438
The boiled meat is the best.

1001
00:34:06,439 --> 00:34:09,639
(The boiled meat is the real deal.)

1002
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:16,279
(They can't help but smile at the taste of black goat meat.)

1003
00:34:16,609 --> 00:34:18,279
(Sighing)

1004
00:34:23,189 --> 00:34:27,489
(It's so good that it makes him angry.)

1005
00:34:27,859 --> 00:34:28,918
I mean...

1006
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:30,229
(I mean...)

1007
00:34:30,289 --> 00:34:32,528
- Are you about to say it?
- Say what?

1008
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:33,859
- What you're thinking about.
- Right.

1009
00:34:33,959 --> 00:34:34,959
Sang Uk.

1010
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:37,028
- We're thinking the same thing.
- The boiled meat.

1011
00:34:37,029 --> 00:34:38,598
- Right?
- Then I'll do the talking.

1012
00:34:38,599 --> 00:34:39,699
What are they doing?

1013
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:41,311
Ma'am,

1014
00:34:41,499 --> 00:34:43,369
- can we order more boiled meat?
- That's it.

1015
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:45,738
I knew the second our eyes locked.

1016
00:34:45,739 --> 00:34:47,378
See?

1017
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:48,738
(That's teamwork at the dining table!)

1018
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:51,348
It's not like we could order more lettuce wraps.

1019
00:34:51,349 --> 00:34:52,478
What could we have done?

1020
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:54,179
Can you start by opening your eyes wider?

1021
00:34:54,979 --> 00:34:57,019
I see no fight in your eyes.

1022
00:34:57,089 --> 00:34:59,118
- But...
- You don't seem like you want...

1023
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:00,718
to get a bite of that.

1024
00:35:00,719 --> 00:35:02,419
You've already admitted defeat.

1025
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:04,428
You shouldn't go on the battlefield.

1026
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:05,788
You wouldn't be able to win a bite of it.

1027
00:35:05,789 --> 00:35:06,828
I don't want any.

1028
00:35:06,829 --> 00:35:07,929
Open your eyes wide.

1029
00:35:08,059 --> 00:35:09,328
(Laughing)

1030
00:35:09,329 --> 00:35:10,768
Open your eyes wide.

1031
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:12,528
(Frustrated)

1032
00:35:12,529 --> 00:35:14,639
All across the country...

1033
00:35:14,869 --> 00:35:16,409
Why are you putting that on?

1034
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:19,538
(He pulls out his handkerchief even though he's not eating.)

1035
00:35:19,539 --> 00:35:20,939
- Why...
- Come on.

1036
00:35:21,009 --> 00:35:22,478
It's hot and I'm sweating.

1037
00:35:22,479 --> 00:35:23,608
It's like I'm the one eating.

1038
00:35:23,609 --> 00:35:26,349
(The passionate speech only made him more fired up.)

1039
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:29,048
I don't know what'll happen...

1040
00:35:29,049 --> 00:35:30,618
once we get our second plate,

1041
00:35:30,619 --> 00:35:31,988
but I want to order a third plate.

1042
00:35:31,989 --> 00:35:33,018
- Right?
- Yes.

1043
00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:35,389
You ordered a second plate but you also want a third.

1044
00:35:35,459 --> 00:35:36,558
Before the food is even here.

1045
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:37,888
You get 50 bonus points.

1046
00:35:37,889 --> 00:35:39,558
(You're someone I want to work with.)

1047
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:41,629
Sit on my left later.

1048
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:43,468
If you're on my right, I might accidentally hit you.

1049
00:35:43,469 --> 00:35:45,268
- Nice.
- I'm that stubborn.

1050
00:35:45,269 --> 00:35:46,869
- Here we go.
- It's here.

1051
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:48,199
It's here.

1052
00:35:48,699 --> 00:35:51,439
(This time, they're having boiled ribs.)

1053
00:35:51,909 --> 00:35:53,009
That's the best cut!

1054
00:35:53,139 --> 00:35:54,938
You really should try this.

1055
00:35:54,939 --> 00:35:56,778
- You should.
- I'm sorry but can you...

1056
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:58,178
give me some water kimchi in here?

1057
00:35:58,179 --> 00:36:00,079
(Can you give me some water kimchi in here?)

1058
00:36:00,249 --> 00:36:01,478
That's not allowed.

1059
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:03,089
- You can skip the hard bits.
- Forget it.

1060
00:36:03,149 --> 00:36:04,249
I'm fine with the soup.

1061
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:05,819
No way.

1062
00:36:05,849 --> 00:36:06,888
Not like that.

1063
00:36:06,889 --> 00:36:09,258
You can imagine the flavors...

1064
00:36:09,259 --> 00:36:11,559
from the way it looks or smells,

1065
00:36:11,659 --> 00:36:13,128
but not with this dish.

1066
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:14,558
I'll say this in advance.

1067
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:15,598
It's better not to have a bite of this.

1068
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:16,728
If you have one piece,

1069
00:36:16,729 --> 00:36:18,029
you'll get even angrier.

1070
00:36:18,329 --> 00:36:19,468
- So don't try it.
- We shouldn't?

1071
00:36:19,469 --> 00:36:20,538
Don't taste it.

1072
00:36:20,539 --> 00:36:22,738
- Okay. He's right.
- One won't be enough.

1073
00:36:22,739 --> 00:36:24,769
Don't have any. Tae Hyun, the same goes for you.

1074
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,478
I know I can have a bite...

1075
00:36:26,479 --> 00:36:27,638
and not be angry about it.

1076
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:28,808
(I know I can not be angry about it.)

1077
00:36:28,809 --> 00:36:30,709
I don't have any anger in me. It's true.

1078
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:32,208
Tae Hyun, that didn't cross my mind.

1079
00:36:32,209 --> 00:36:33,478
You said this was the dish to start with.

1080
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:34,879
The rest of your life...

1081
00:36:34,919 --> 00:36:36,079
could be tough.

1082
00:36:36,349 --> 00:36:37,618
"How could I have spent..."

1083
00:36:37,619 --> 00:36:39,019
"all these years not eating black goat?"

1084
00:36:39,349 --> 00:36:40,658
"You fool!"

1085
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:42,359
- You're right.
- "I'm such a fool!"

1086
00:36:42,489 --> 00:36:44,128
Die without ever knowing how this tastes!

1087
00:36:44,129 --> 00:36:46,558
(Die without ever knowing how this tastes!)

1088
00:36:46,559 --> 00:36:47,559
The misfortune will be mine.

1089
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,929
I can't help it since I know the taste.

1090
00:36:50,299 --> 00:36:52,129
The misfortune will be mine!

1091
00:36:52,969 --> 00:36:54,938
(Poor Se Yoon)

1092
00:36:54,939 --> 00:36:55,939
Come on.

1093
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,769
I should know the flavors, but I can't.

1094
00:36:58,639 --> 00:36:59,709
Gosh, this...

1095
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:01,778
Why don't I continue to be unhappy?

1096
00:37:01,779 --> 00:37:04,048
(Why don't I continue to be unhappy?)

1097
00:37:04,049 --> 00:37:05,879
- Shall we do it, then?
- What?

1098
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,718
We let you have a lettuce wrap earlier.

1099
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:09,378
- Sure.
- Right.

1100
00:37:09,379 --> 00:37:10,388
One person will get to eat.

1101
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:12,448
All right. We're doing it right now.

1102
00:37:12,449 --> 00:37:13,658
(Boiled black goat: A quiz for the freeloaders)

1103
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:14,888
I really want to eat this.

1104
00:37:14,889 --> 00:37:16,259
I'll regret it if I don't.

1105
00:37:18,289 --> 00:37:19,389
- Darn!
- He failed.

1106
00:37:19,959 --> 00:37:20,999
Me after you?

1107
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:22,929
(Tae Hyun also fails.)

1108
00:37:23,729 --> 00:37:24,769
Will the skies favor him?

1109
00:37:26,139 --> 00:37:28,799
(Se Yoon will get to freeload.)

1110
00:37:29,069 --> 00:37:31,469
(I really want to try that...)

1111
00:37:31,539 --> 00:37:33,909
- Just eat everything at once.
- Exactly.

1112
00:37:35,609 --> 00:37:36,709
Fifty dollars.

1113
00:37:37,179 --> 00:37:38,278
Get lost.

1114
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:40,379
(Get lost.)

1115
00:37:40,649 --> 00:37:42,889
(Not a chance)

1116
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,218
I never forfeit my chance to eat.

1117
00:37:45,219 --> 00:37:47,488
(I never forfeit my chance to eat.)

1118
00:37:47,489 --> 00:37:49,218
That's Neoguri from "Tazza."

1119
00:37:49,219 --> 00:37:51,129
- I love it.
- A voice impression.

1120
00:37:51,389 --> 00:37:54,128
No, wait. Stop!

1121
00:37:54,129 --> 00:37:55,558
- Here he goes.
- No, hold on.

1122
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:57,099
This looks delicious.

1123
00:37:57,999 --> 00:37:59,668
I can shoot!

1124
00:37:59,669 --> 00:38:01,469
- Shoot if you can.
- I can shoot!

1125
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,539
(Take that!)

1126
00:38:04,309 --> 00:38:05,469
I can shoot!

1127
00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:12,949
(My gosh)

1128
00:38:13,819 --> 00:38:15,648
I want to join you.

1129
00:38:15,649 --> 00:38:16,849
I'll join you.

1130
00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:18,648
It's really good.

1131
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:22,059
(Don't tell us how it tastes.)

1132
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:24,789
(You're so annoying.)

1133
00:38:27,329 --> 00:38:30,128
(The aroma and flavor fill his mouth.)

1134
00:38:30,129 --> 00:38:32,069
- And this...
- It's really good.

1135
00:38:33,699 --> 00:38:35,598
- Even with a lot, it's not salty.
- How is it?

1136
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,609
(How is it?)

1137
00:38:38,269 --> 00:38:42,008
(I'll savor it some more.)

1138
00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:43,048
It's the best.

1139
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:45,278
You know what they said about meat.

1140
00:38:45,279 --> 00:38:46,518
Buy pork for yourself,

1141
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,748
but only have beef when someone else is treating.

1142
00:38:47,749 --> 00:38:50,019
If someone's having duck, steal it.

1143
00:38:50,049 --> 00:38:51,488
With black goat meat,

1144
00:38:51,489 --> 00:38:52,548
knock him out cold, and then steal it.

1145
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:53,689
(Knock him out cold, and then steal it.)

1146
00:38:53,759 --> 00:38:55,958
When he's going down, take the meat...

1147
00:38:55,959 --> 00:38:57,289
and enjoy it yourself.

1148
00:38:57,929 --> 00:38:59,089
Do you get what I mean?

1149
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:01,358
- I could've knocked you out.
- Exactly.

1150
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:02,528
(I should've knocked Se Yoon out.)

1151
00:39:02,529 --> 00:39:03,599
I wouldn't have argued.

1152
00:39:05,529 --> 00:39:06,738
What's that?

1153
00:39:06,739 --> 00:39:08,339
What on earth is this?

1154
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:11,969
(The signature menu: Black goat baeksuk in stone pot)

1155
00:39:12,169 --> 00:39:17,209
(An impressive nutty taste and scent rooted in perilla seeds)

1156
00:39:18,909 --> 00:39:20,348
- What is this?
- Is that black goat baeksuk?

1157
00:39:20,349 --> 00:39:21,519
No way.

1158
00:39:22,019 --> 00:39:23,488
Is that black goat baeksuk?

1159
00:39:23,489 --> 00:39:24,889
- What on earth is this?
- Can we get plates?

1160
00:39:25,549 --> 00:39:27,718
It's like a perilla seed soup.

1161
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:29,489
(Like a perilla seed soup)

1162
00:39:30,729 --> 00:39:32,829
(My gosh)

1163
00:39:33,299 --> 00:39:35,459
- Wait. Is that meat?
- Yes, meat.

1164
00:39:35,499 --> 00:39:36,598
- Meat?
- Yes.

1165
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:38,328
- Dong Hyun, here you go.
- It's not on the bones.

1166
00:39:38,329 --> 00:39:39,329
That was cooked just to get the broth.

1167
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,939
- Dong Hyun, here you go.
- Really? Thanks.

1168
00:39:41,569 --> 00:39:43,039
It's hot. Sang Uk, you next.

1169
00:39:43,639 --> 00:39:45,909
(The aroma)

1170
00:39:46,269 --> 00:39:48,738
(Mouth-watering)

1171
00:39:48,739 --> 00:39:52,379
(Eating the black goat baeksuk in stone pot)

1172
00:39:54,419 --> 00:39:56,749
They must've added a whole bucket of perilla seeds in there.

1173
00:39:56,849 --> 00:40:00,119
- A whole bucket.
- We have perilla seed soup, right?

1174
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:02,389
The umami hits perfectly.

1175
00:40:03,789 --> 00:40:06,088
The broth was made with the black goat bones.

1176
00:40:06,089 --> 00:40:07,929
- The umami hits perfectly.
- Exactly.

1177
00:40:08,729 --> 00:40:10,599
(Humming)

1178
00:40:10,799 --> 00:40:15,539
(Curious about the flavors)

1179
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,039
- A whole bucket.
- We have perilla seed soup, right?

1180
00:40:19,269 --> 00:40:21,038
The umami hits perfectly.

1181
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:22,109
(The umami hits perfectly.)

1182
00:40:22,179 --> 00:40:25,809
(Black goat baeksuk in stone pot explodes with flavors.)

1183
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:33,519
(Diving into the rich flavors of the black goat baeksuk in stone pot)

1184
00:40:36,629 --> 00:40:39,428
I can't believe I spent my life not knowing this dish.

1185
00:40:39,429 --> 00:40:40,528
This is the first time...

1186
00:40:40,529 --> 00:40:41,598
I'm seeing black goat cooked like this.

1187
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,758
- Same here.
- Right?

1188
00:40:42,759 --> 00:40:44,598
(Their first encounter with the black goat baeksuk in stone pot)

1189
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:46,668
- Is this a first for you too?
- Yes.

1190
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:47,868
Even for you?

1191
00:40:47,869 --> 00:40:49,168
This...

1192
00:40:49,169 --> 00:40:50,308
This is how it is.

1193
00:40:50,309 --> 00:40:52,038
Letting them taste it will make them angrier...

1194
00:40:52,039 --> 00:40:53,208
than depriving them of it.

1195
00:40:53,209 --> 00:40:54,209
Just a taste of it.

1196
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:55,979
Make me angry, then.

1197
00:40:56,979 --> 00:40:58,278
- I want some.
- One person...

1198
00:40:58,279 --> 00:41:01,219
will get the chance to have one spoonful of the food.

1199
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:03,649
We'll serve a spoonful of food.

1200
00:41:03,689 --> 00:41:05,189
(Flick the Bottle Cap)

1201
00:41:05,919 --> 00:41:07,489
Okay! It flew off the table.

1202
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:10,258
(Tae Hyun made it inside the line.)

1203
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:11,259
This is easy.

1204
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,199
Judging by your mental state, you'll flick it too hard.

1205
00:41:13,499 --> 00:41:16,629
(Eliminated!)

1206
00:41:17,399 --> 00:41:21,369
(Tae Hyun gets to freeload.)

1207
00:41:21,499 --> 00:41:22,938
I'll give you some.

1208
00:41:22,939 --> 00:41:24,368
No way.

1209
00:41:24,369 --> 00:41:25,508
I want some of the sujebi.

1210
00:41:25,509 --> 00:41:27,508
- There aren't any. Onions...
- There are. Right here.

1211
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:29,709
- Here. Is that not sujebi?
- Those are onions.

1212
00:41:29,909 --> 00:41:31,748
Aren't those pieces of sujebi?

1213
00:41:31,749 --> 00:41:32,849
Don't you want them?

1214
00:41:32,979 --> 00:41:34,049
Onions?

1215
00:41:34,349 --> 00:41:36,449
Have this and the broth.

1216
00:41:36,689 --> 00:41:38,419
Can't I have the dongchimi instead?

1217
00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:41,218
- And not have the stew?
- Try the broth.

1218
00:41:41,219 --> 00:41:42,888
- Not the stew?
- No.

1219
00:41:42,889 --> 00:41:44,428
Have some, and you'll get some dongchimi.

1220
00:41:44,429 --> 00:41:46,029
- Really? Okay.
- What?

1221
00:41:46,659 --> 00:41:48,729
Are we supposed to feed him like a baby?

1222
00:41:49,199 --> 00:41:51,428
What on earth is this?

1223
00:41:51,429 --> 00:41:52,628
Then, I'll have some.

1224
00:41:52,629 --> 00:41:54,199
You'll get some if you finish this.

1225
00:41:54,569 --> 00:41:56,809
Don't forget to chew.

1226
00:41:57,609 --> 00:41:59,569
A balanced diet is the key to growing tall.

1227
00:41:59,669 --> 00:42:00,808
Don't forget to chew.

1228
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,239
Delicious, isn't it?

1229
00:42:03,179 --> 00:42:05,179
- Did he swallow?
- It's good.

1230
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:06,308
Gosh, the umami.

1231
00:42:06,309 --> 00:42:07,779
- Right?
- Delicious, isn't it?

1232
00:42:07,919 --> 00:42:10,718
These aren't the flavors I was expecting.

1233
00:42:10,719 --> 00:42:13,118
There's a sweetness to it thanks to the onions and garlic.

1234
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,719
- I tasted the sweetness.
- It's strong.

1235
00:42:14,789 --> 00:42:16,529
Perilla seeds are in fact...

1236
00:42:17,029 --> 00:42:18,929
- Amazing, right?
- No way.

1237
00:42:19,959 --> 00:42:22,399
Once you finish that...

1238
00:42:23,099 --> 00:42:25,198
- Cleanse your palate.
- Eat the baeksuk...

1239
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:27,098
and finish off with the dongchimi.

1240
00:42:27,099 --> 00:42:28,669
(Try it.)

1241
00:42:29,099 --> 00:42:30,768
(Drinking the dongchimi)

1242
00:42:30,769 --> 00:42:32,438
This is heartwarming.

1243
00:42:32,439 --> 00:42:34,709
(Hey!)

1244
00:42:34,779 --> 00:42:37,079
- It's the best.
- Is it the best?

1245
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:39,379
I told you it was the best.

1246
00:42:41,349 --> 00:42:42,718
It's so good.

1247
00:42:42,719 --> 00:42:44,148
This is the signature dish, right?

1248
00:42:44,149 --> 00:42:46,248
You can't find this anywhere else.

1249
00:42:46,249 --> 00:42:47,759
- Right?
- Exactly.

1250
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:49,359
It's too bad.

1251
00:42:49,659 --> 00:42:51,328
Unbelievable.

1252
00:42:51,329 --> 00:42:52,689
(It's too bad you don't get to have any.)

1253
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:54,958
I'll be back here to eat.

1254
00:42:54,959 --> 00:42:56,459
(I'll be back here to eat.)

1255
00:42:56,869 --> 00:42:57,869
Okay.

1256
00:42:57,870 --> 00:43:00,298
(Unfortunately, that's the end of the black goat baeksuk.)

1257
00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:02,438
If you want more, pour the dongchimi...

1258
00:43:02,439 --> 00:43:03,708
in the water bottle.

1259
00:43:03,709 --> 00:43:05,739
(Pour the dongchimi in the water bottle.)

1260
00:43:05,909 --> 00:43:07,608
- I think...
- Stop it.

1261
00:43:07,609 --> 00:43:09,009
we've gotten closer.

1262
00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:11,749
Stop talking.

1263
00:43:12,309 --> 00:43:13,619
He can't let it go.

1264
00:43:15,449 --> 00:43:17,148
- Is this the hot pot?
- The hot pot is here.

1265
00:43:17,149 --> 00:43:18,819
(Amazed)

1266
00:43:19,419 --> 00:43:21,989
(The finale, black goat hot pot)

1267
00:43:22,859 --> 00:43:24,758
(Spicy and refreshing soup...)

1268
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:28,429
(with lots of water parsley and perilla leaves)

1269
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:31,629
- Gosh, it smells good.
- Well.

1270
00:43:33,129 --> 00:43:34,868
I thought the boiled goat was the main dish...

1271
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:36,199
and the rest was to clear the palate.

1272
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:37,739
But every dish is a main dish.

1273
00:43:38,109 --> 00:43:39,208
- I didn't put much meat.
- Okay.

1274
00:43:39,209 --> 00:43:42,709
(Serving Sang Uk a bowl of hot pot first)

1275
00:43:47,279 --> 00:43:48,619
(Amazed)

1276
00:43:48,749 --> 00:43:49,948
Before every tournament,

1277
00:43:49,949 --> 00:43:51,548
- I have goat dishes.
- Right.

1278
00:43:51,549 --> 00:43:54,419
They usually put lots of perilla seeds in the hot pot.

1279
00:43:54,689 --> 00:43:56,358
When this hot pot came out,

1280
00:43:56,359 --> 00:43:57,958
I saw it doesn't have many perilla seeds.

1281
00:43:57,959 --> 00:43:59,758
- It tastes much cleaner.
- Exactly.

1282
00:43:59,759 --> 00:44:02,598
It looks like a clear spicy fish stew.

1283
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:04,269
(The soup is spicy and refreshing like a clear spicy fish stew.)

1284
00:44:07,739 --> 00:44:08,869
It's filled with umami.

1285
00:44:12,269 --> 00:44:14,179
- It's so refreshing.
- You have to have it.

1286
00:44:15,079 --> 00:44:16,108
It's so refreshing.

1287
00:44:16,109 --> 00:44:17,479
(Talking in Seung Ho's tone)

1288
00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:19,509
Seung Ho has a nice voice.

1289
00:44:20,019 --> 00:44:21,648
- You like to imitate people.
- What?

1290
00:44:21,649 --> 00:44:22,718
You like to do people's impressions.

1291
00:44:22,719 --> 00:44:24,719
There is only one key to do impressions.

1292
00:44:25,049 --> 00:44:27,589
What differentiates Seung Ho from Detective Neoguri...

1293
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:29,758
is the strength of my voice.

1294
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:31,828
- Exactly. If it receives well...
- How does it change?

1295
00:44:31,829 --> 00:44:32,889
How does it change?

1296
00:44:33,259 --> 00:44:35,529
- This is very thick.
- Okay.

1297
00:44:35,759 --> 00:44:36,829
This is very thick.

1298
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:38,529
This is very thick.

1299
00:44:39,029 --> 00:44:40,469
This is very thick.

1300
00:44:40,669 --> 00:44:43,669
(Laughing)

1301
00:44:43,969 --> 00:44:45,508
This is very thick.

1302
00:44:45,509 --> 00:44:48,308
(It's Seung Ho when the voice has less strength.)

1303
00:44:48,309 --> 00:44:49,309
- Did it work?
- Gosh.

1304
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:50,408
(From Detective Neoguri to Seung Ho, he can do it freely.)

1305
00:44:50,409 --> 00:44:51,948
I can go back and forth in the end.

1306
00:44:51,949 --> 00:44:53,878
Still, it requires that baritone voice.

1307
00:44:53,879 --> 00:44:55,078
(It needs the baritone voice.)

1308
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:56,948
"No?" His tone won't work.

1309
00:44:56,949 --> 00:44:59,448
(He can't mimic Dong Hyun's tone.)

1310
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:00,989
"This tastes good." It won't work.

1311
00:45:01,289 --> 00:45:02,818
That's similar to Jong Min's voice.

1312
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:04,158
These two have similar voices.

1313
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,228
You're right.

1314
00:45:05,229 --> 00:45:06,358
(Dong Hyun and Jong Min have a similar vibe.)

1315
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:07,729
It's called "3 letters, 1 stutter."

1316
00:45:08,099 --> 00:45:09,599
They stutter once every three letters.

1317
00:45:11,269 --> 00:45:12,869
- It's "3 letters, 1 stutter." - Yes. It's "3 letters, 1 stutter."

1318
00:45:12,929 --> 00:45:15,698
What do I... here...

1319
00:45:15,699 --> 00:45:16,939
- That was Jong Min.
- Yes, it was.

1320
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,569
How about Dong Hyun?

1321
00:45:18,769 --> 00:45:20,979
"In the UFT..."

1322
00:45:23,449 --> 00:45:25,679
Hey, I can pronounce UFC correctly.

1323
00:45:25,909 --> 00:45:29,948
"Was it UFC or KFC?" He speaks like that.

1324
00:45:29,949 --> 00:45:31,388
(Exaggerating)

1325
00:45:31,389 --> 00:45:32,488
"UFT?"

1326
00:45:32,489 --> 00:45:33,588
(Laughing)

1327
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:35,459
We've signed an MOU.

1328
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:37,588
- We can mock one another.
- Of course.

1329
00:45:37,589 --> 00:45:38,728
- It's okay.
- Yes.

1330
00:45:38,729 --> 00:45:40,658
It's a three-person contract that includes Jong Min.

1331
00:45:40,659 --> 00:45:41,659
- It's so good.
- We do.

1332
00:45:41,729 --> 00:45:44,028
- It's so good. Today, - Seriously.

1333
00:45:44,029 --> 00:45:47,699
- my body is sweating in a good way.
- You're right.

1334
00:45:47,939 --> 00:45:49,199
- Because you're energized.
- With increased energy.

1335
00:45:49,339 --> 00:45:51,338
It's the sweat from my body getting pumped up.

1336
00:45:51,339 --> 00:45:52,638
Now, for me...

1337
00:45:52,639 --> 00:45:55,108
I've been to many places that sell healthy food.

1338
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:57,748
I tried the boiled goat while expecting how it'd taste.

1339
00:45:57,749 --> 00:46:00,548
But its quality and flavors exceeded my expectations.

1340
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:02,918
- And?
- And I was new to...

1341
00:46:02,919 --> 00:46:06,218
black goat baeksuk in a stone pot, but when I had it,

1342
00:46:06,219 --> 00:46:07,589
it felt like I was in an amusement park.

1343
00:46:08,259 --> 00:46:09,819
It was like when I first visited an amusement park.

1344
00:46:09,889 --> 00:46:11,429
Lastly, the hot pot...

1345
00:46:11,489 --> 00:46:14,699
felt like entering home after a really good trip.

1346
00:46:15,059 --> 00:46:18,869
(It has a flavor that melts a heart with warmth after a long journey.)

1347
00:46:18,899 --> 00:46:20,439
Those were great metaphors.

1348
00:46:21,369 --> 00:46:23,539
Gosh. You have a whole script about today.

1349
00:46:24,109 --> 00:46:25,909
The title of the movie is "Black Goat."

1350
00:46:27,809 --> 00:46:30,079
(Spoiling the mood)

1351
00:46:30,149 --> 00:46:31,349
I'll go with "Old Goat Partner."

1352
00:46:32,809 --> 00:46:33,878
- "Old Goat Partner?" - "Old Goat Partner."

1353
00:46:33,879 --> 00:46:34,879
"But I love you."

1354
00:46:35,419 --> 00:46:38,518
(Old Goat Partner, I love you It's all a lie)

1355
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:40,518
(Quaking)

1356
00:46:40,519 --> 00:46:41,519
A goat goes...

1357
00:46:41,519 --> 00:46:42,519
(Squealing)

1358
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,959
- That's a pig.
- That's why it's all a lie.

1359
00:46:45,089 --> 00:46:46,258
Old Goat Partner

1360
00:46:46,259 --> 00:46:47,328
(Moo)

1361
00:46:47,329 --> 00:46:48,629
It's all a lie

1362
00:46:48,899 --> 00:46:50,669
It's all a lie. How is that for a movie?

1363
00:46:50,869 --> 00:46:52,099
For goodness' sake.

1364
00:46:53,399 --> 00:46:56,039
I have to watch the black goat for a long time.

1365
00:46:56,809 --> 00:46:57,969
Let's get the bill.

1366
00:46:59,109 --> 00:47:00,209
Thank you.

1367
00:47:00,439 --> 00:47:02,338
(Surprised)

1368
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:04,078
- Why? Is it expensive?
- It's expensive.

1369
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:05,349
- Is it?
- Yes.

1370
00:47:05,749 --> 00:47:07,919
- It's 468 dollars.
- I see.

1371
00:47:08,349 --> 00:47:09,848
- It's expensive.
- It's costly.

1372
00:47:09,849 --> 00:47:12,288
- It's expensive for lunch.
- Why is it so expensive?

1373
00:47:12,289 --> 00:47:13,658
- Let's calm down.
- Yes.

1374
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:14,718
Let's solve the quiz...

1375
00:47:14,719 --> 00:47:16,218
- as if it was other's quiz.
- Okay.

1376
00:47:16,219 --> 00:47:19,159
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

1377
00:47:19,289 --> 00:47:21,399
In Japan in 2023,

1378
00:47:21,859 --> 00:47:25,168
they started a service to rent goats for this.

1379
00:47:25,169 --> 00:47:26,599
- In 2023?
- Yes.

1380
00:47:26,699 --> 00:47:27,938
That wasn't long ago.

1381
00:47:27,939 --> 00:47:31,469
The cost to rent a goat is 3,000 yen for 3 months.

1382
00:47:31,539 --> 00:47:33,608
- It's 30 dollars.
- It's 30 dollars.

1383
00:47:33,609 --> 00:47:35,978
It was received well because they can do business...

1384
00:47:35,979 --> 00:47:38,749
- in an eco-friendly way.
- I think I know what it is.

1385
00:47:39,709 --> 00:47:42,018
- What is this task?
- Weeding.

1386
00:47:42,019 --> 00:47:43,788
- You're right. It's mowing.
- Right?

1387
00:47:43,789 --> 00:47:44,793
It's either mowing or milking.

1388
00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:47,218
- Milking?
- It's really cheap.

1389
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:49,518
A goat does a job for you.

1390
00:47:49,519 --> 00:47:52,429
For example, it poops to manure the field.

1391
00:47:52,689 --> 00:47:55,499
It weeds or eats insects.

1392
00:47:55,759 --> 00:47:57,769
Or does it scream with you for you to sing well?

1393
00:47:58,469 --> 00:47:59,628
- "To sing well?" - I'd love it.

1394
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:01,169
Is it for singing?

1395
00:48:01,469 --> 00:48:03,098
You don't have to pay for vocal lessons.

1396
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:04,309
(A way to learn to sing without paying for vocal lessons)

1397
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,369
(Bleating)

1398
00:48:06,439 --> 00:48:07,478
(Ignoring)

1399
00:48:07,479 --> 00:48:09,478
It has to be weeding.

1400
00:48:09,479 --> 00:48:11,309
(Disappointed)

1401
00:48:11,479 --> 00:48:14,218
- I think it's weeding.
- Right?

1402
00:48:14,219 --> 00:48:16,318
- Let's go for it.
- Should we try it?

1403
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:17,419
A weeding business.

1404
00:48:18,049 --> 00:48:19,989
That's too mundane for an answer.

1405
00:48:20,589 --> 00:48:21,689
That's the only answer.

1406
00:48:23,019 --> 00:48:24,429
(Please.)

1407
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:25,929
It's correct.

1408
00:48:26,289 --> 00:48:27,329
That's right!

1409
00:48:28,759 --> 00:48:30,968
- Let's go.
- It had to be that one.

1410
00:48:30,969 --> 00:48:32,068
(Dong Hyun, Seung Ho, Sang Uk are exempted from paying.)

1411
00:48:32,069 --> 00:48:35,198
(We are screwed.)

1412
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:36,668
- Come on.
- Was it 400 and...

1413
00:48:36,669 --> 00:48:37,808
And 68 dollars.

1414
00:48:37,809 --> 00:48:38,839
It's about 500 dollars.

1415
00:48:39,109 --> 00:48:40,639
(Surprised)

1416
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:42,878
- It's 468 dollars.
- What was the answer?

1417
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:44,308
(A big bill has come.)

1418
00:48:44,309 --> 00:48:46,509
Now, we have to pick 1 out of 3.

1419
00:48:46,809 --> 00:48:49,178
- I'll give you a famous quote.
- A famous quote?

1420
00:48:49,179 --> 00:48:50,248
- That one's hard.
- A famous quote.

1421
00:48:50,249 --> 00:48:51,249
I like multiple-choice questions.

1422
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:54,089
You have to guess what A and B are.

1423
00:48:54,519 --> 00:48:57,228
When you guess one right, you pass.

1424
00:48:57,229 --> 00:48:58,629
- If you get both, the rest is out.
- Yes.

1425
00:48:58,959 --> 00:49:02,229
A makes people stay.

1426
00:49:02,399 --> 00:49:05,728
B brings people closer.

1427
00:49:05,729 --> 00:49:08,938
Width makes people follow you.

1428
00:49:08,939 --> 00:49:11,738
Depth touches people's hearts.

1429
00:49:11,739 --> 00:49:14,239
- Width and what?
- Depth.

1430
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,808
Isn't it a quote on the restroom at a rest area?

1431
00:49:16,809 --> 00:49:17,848
You're right. It sounds like it.

1432
00:49:17,849 --> 00:49:19,409
Pee makes people stay.

1433
00:49:21,349 --> 00:49:22,979
Isn't poop more likely to do so?

1434
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:25,688
It's a quote from Dasan Jeong Yak Yong.

1435
00:49:25,689 --> 00:49:28,218
Jeong Yak Yong wouldn't have said about poop and pee.

1436
00:49:28,219 --> 00:49:29,488
(Scratching out poop and pee)

1437
00:49:29,489 --> 00:49:31,689
- I got it. B is trust.
- Okay.

1438
00:49:32,259 --> 00:49:34,028
Trust. It's incorrect.

1439
00:49:34,029 --> 00:49:36,729
- B is mercy.
- Mercy is incorrect.

1440
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:37,968
Se Yoon hasn't said anything.

1441
00:49:37,969 --> 00:49:39,099
(Se Yoon has the chance.)

1442
00:49:40,569 --> 00:49:42,698
I'll stay for kimchi stew, for sure.

1443
00:49:42,699 --> 00:49:44,569
I can't leave the seat when there's kimchi stew.

1444
00:49:45,569 --> 00:49:47,509
"Kimchi stew makes people stay."

1445
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:50,078
- B is...
- Okay.

1446
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,608
(B brings people closer.)

1447
00:49:51,609 --> 00:49:52,679
greetings.

1448
00:49:52,949 --> 00:49:55,619
- "Greetings." - Greetings bring people closer.

1449
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:57,789
- Incorrect.
- Okay.

1450
00:49:57,849 --> 00:49:58,849
Just go for it now.

1451
00:49:58,850 --> 00:49:59,888
(From now on, they can keep guessing.)

1452
00:49:59,889 --> 00:50:02,218
- A is kindness.
- Incorrect.

1453
00:50:02,219 --> 00:50:04,559
A is a smile.

1454
00:50:05,059 --> 00:50:06,729
- Incorrect.
- A is acceptance.

1455
00:50:07,329 --> 00:50:08,358
Incorrect.

1456
00:50:08,359 --> 00:50:09,698
What did Jeong Yak Yong say?

1457
00:50:09,699 --> 00:50:11,168
(They have no idea.)

1458
00:50:11,169 --> 00:50:12,169
Gosh. It's so hard.

1459
00:50:12,399 --> 00:50:14,838
- Is there a hint?
- We'd like a hint.

1460
00:50:14,839 --> 00:50:15,839
It can be a gesture hint.

1461
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:17,238
I think you all know this.

1462
00:50:17,239 --> 00:50:20,069
"Too much of this is conceit."

1463
00:50:20,239 --> 00:50:21,278
Too much of this?

1464
00:50:21,279 --> 00:50:22,378
I got it. A is modesty.

1465
00:50:22,379 --> 00:50:23,439
- Modesty is correct.
- Yes!

1466
00:50:25,149 --> 00:50:26,849
- That was an easy one.
- Yes!

1467
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:28,419
Right. You have to be modest.

1468
00:50:28,649 --> 00:50:31,149
- I did it.
- In my opinion,

1469
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,419
B is even easier.

1470
00:50:32,449 --> 00:50:33,859
- It's a really easy one.
- It's...

1471
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,918
When you present this to people, you bring people closer.

1472
00:50:36,919 --> 00:50:37,989
I got it. Compliment.

1473
00:50:38,159 --> 00:50:39,258
- Compliment?
- We did that one already.

1474
00:50:39,259 --> 00:50:40,299
Correct.

1475
00:50:40,399 --> 00:50:41,758
We said compliments before.

1476
00:50:41,759 --> 00:50:43,929
No, we didn't. We didn't mention compliments.

1477
00:50:44,469 --> 00:50:46,229
- You said kindness.
- Really?

1478
00:50:47,369 --> 00:50:48,698
I thought we said it.

1479
00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:51,139
(It's quickly confirmed that Tae Hyun would pay for it.)

1480
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:52,908
I paid before too.

1481
00:50:52,909 --> 00:50:55,479
But you had the baeksuk too.

1482
00:50:57,709 --> 00:50:58,809
I'm sorry, Tae Hyun.

1483
00:50:59,149 --> 00:51:01,418
- Justice is still alive, Tae Hyun.
- "Justice is still alive."

1484
00:51:01,419 --> 00:51:02,419
- You're right.
- Justice is still alive.

1485
00:51:02,420 --> 00:51:03,618
- He ate the most.
- Tae Hyun.

1486
00:51:03,619 --> 00:51:05,249
Paying makes people follow you.

1487
00:51:06,219 --> 00:51:09,859
Is it 460 dollars? Oh, well.

1488
00:51:12,159 --> 00:51:13,228
Is it good? Okay.

1489
00:51:13,229 --> 00:51:15,199
(Good)

1490
00:51:16,129 --> 00:51:17,498
- Thank you.
- It was good.

1491
00:51:17,499 --> 00:51:19,468
- Thank you, Tae Hyun.
- We enjoyed the food.

1492
00:51:19,469 --> 00:51:21,238
- Okay.
- It is what it is.

1493
00:51:21,239 --> 00:51:22,669
(Lunch recommendations in Pyeongchang-dong)

1494
00:51:23,199 --> 00:51:24,869
Here. It was really good.

1495
00:51:25,309 --> 00:51:26,639
It was so good.

1496
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:28,978
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1497
00:51:28,979 --> 00:51:30,978
(Total: 468 dollars)

1498
00:51:30,979 --> 00:51:32,509
It's 468 dollars.

1499
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:36,318
(A cafe in an art museum in Pyeongchang-dong...)

1500
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,548
(after a break)

1501
00:51:37,549 --> 00:51:38,649
What is this?

1502
00:51:38,789 --> 00:51:41,318
Is it because we're in Pyeongchang-dong?

1503
00:51:41,319 --> 00:51:43,559
Even this cafe has a Pyeongchang-dong's vibe.

1504
00:51:43,659 --> 00:51:45,358
- It's the vibe of the neighborhood.
- Yes.

1505
00:51:45,359 --> 00:51:46,929
It has a quiet vibe.

1506
00:51:47,159 --> 00:51:48,628
It doesn't feel like Seoul, does it?

1507
00:51:48,629 --> 00:51:50,329
It's so pretty. Landscaping is nice too.

1508
00:51:50,799 --> 00:51:52,028
Gosh. I'm hungry. Let's hurry.

1509
00:51:52,029 --> 00:51:53,698
- What?
- He's hungry.

1510
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:55,398
- Are you hungry?
- Aren't you supposed to be hungry?

1511
00:51:55,399 --> 00:51:56,668
Look at the time.

1512
00:51:56,669 --> 00:51:57,738
(Checking the time)

1513
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:01,178
It's been more than five hours since I ate. My belly is empty.

1514
00:52:01,179 --> 00:52:02,879
Hey, you freeloaded some food.

1515
00:52:03,409 --> 00:52:04,549
You ate enough.

1516
00:52:04,779 --> 00:52:06,348
(He can't believe what he heard.)

1517
00:52:06,349 --> 00:52:08,148
- In the middle...
- I got goosebumps.

1518
00:52:08,149 --> 00:52:10,348
You two are wired differently.

1519
00:52:10,349 --> 00:52:11,349
Seriously.

1520
00:52:11,489 --> 00:52:14,389
Honestly, you can't say that you're hungry now.

1521
00:52:14,489 --> 00:52:17,088
(Dumbfounded)

1522
00:52:17,089 --> 00:52:20,128
For dinner, Se Yoon will go with the ones he chose,

1523
00:52:20,129 --> 00:52:22,058
- which is Sang Uk and Seung Ho.
- Yes.

1524
00:52:22,059 --> 00:52:23,459
Let the restaurant know in advance.

1525
00:52:23,659 --> 00:52:25,429
I'm worried about something.

1526
00:52:26,629 --> 00:52:28,968
We have athletes here. For example, Messi and Ronaldo.

1527
00:52:28,969 --> 00:52:32,168
I, the striker, couldn't play because I was injured.

1528
00:52:32,169 --> 00:52:34,738
Only these two were in the match, which turned out to be a big match.

1529
00:52:34,739 --> 00:52:36,638
- It was a black goat course meal.
- Right.

1530
00:52:36,639 --> 00:52:40,208
But will it be okay to put these two back into a new match...

1531
00:52:40,209 --> 00:52:41,618
- as a leader?
- You have a lot on your mind.

1532
00:52:41,619 --> 00:52:42,678
That's what I'm worried about.

1533
00:52:42,679 --> 00:52:46,248
I want to know about the condition of my players.

1534
00:52:46,249 --> 00:52:49,489
- Tell me.
- As for me, Se Yoon...

1535
00:52:49,889 --> 00:52:50,889
Can you play in the match?

1536
00:52:50,889 --> 00:52:51,889
(Can he?)

1537
00:52:52,129 --> 00:52:53,458
- I can play.
- Okay.

1538
00:52:53,459 --> 00:52:55,129
(Good)

1539
00:52:55,259 --> 00:52:56,299
Okay, then.

1540
00:52:56,459 --> 00:52:59,629
- What about Sang Uk?
- I'm the only active athlete here.

1541
00:52:59,669 --> 00:53:01,468
- Right. Okay.
- I'm still in the field.

1542
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,099
Even without the soccer cleats,

1543
00:53:03,399 --> 00:53:04,569
I can play barefoot.

1544
00:53:05,609 --> 00:53:07,678
I'm always ready to play.

1545
00:53:07,679 --> 00:53:09,208
Look at their coach.

1546
00:53:09,209 --> 00:53:10,549
(He has the foodie team he has dreamed of.)

1547
00:53:10,809 --> 00:53:12,078
Gobbling Fat Hiddink.

1548
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:13,848
(As known as Gobbling Fat Hiddink)

1549
00:53:13,849 --> 00:53:14,979
I'm still hungry.

1550
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:17,188
- You're...
- No.

1551
00:53:17,189 --> 00:53:18,289
Se Yoon is...

1552
00:53:19,349 --> 00:53:21,318
- Fat Hiddink.
- Let's have a great match.

1553
00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:22,359
Okay.

1554
00:53:22,759 --> 00:53:23,959
I'm looking forward to it.

1555
00:53:25,029 --> 00:53:27,058
I've researched dinner options...

1556
00:53:27,059 --> 00:53:29,498
- In Pyeongchang-dong.
- Okay.

1557
00:53:29,499 --> 00:53:30,698
- What are the options?
- Let's hear them.

1558
00:53:30,699 --> 00:53:32,229
- Is it Korean beef?
- It must be.

1559
00:53:32,529 --> 00:53:35,969
One of them is Pyeongchang-dong's royal short ribs.

1560
00:53:36,139 --> 00:53:37,368
It's supposed to be really good.

1561
00:53:37,369 --> 00:53:38,608
The royal short ribs suit Pyeongchang-dong.

1562
00:53:38,609 --> 00:53:40,539
- Royal short ribs?
- It's not braised.

1563
00:53:40,709 --> 00:53:42,838
You know how they roll the meat around the bone.

1564
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:43,949
Royal short ribs.

1565
00:53:44,109 --> 00:53:47,518
(A Seoul's famous BBQ place specialized in Korean beef)

1566
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:50,279
Last week, 4 people ate 17 servings of food.

1567
00:53:50,449 --> 00:53:51,688
It was grilled meat.

1568
00:53:51,689 --> 00:53:53,049
- While eating that...
- So, 4 people ate 17 servings.

1569
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:55,119
- What?
- Okay.

1570
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:56,488
It's nothing to you.

1571
00:53:56,489 --> 00:53:58,229
Did you think I'd go, "Really?"

1572
00:53:59,089 --> 00:54:00,459
Was that what you were expecting?

1573
00:54:00,999 --> 00:54:02,029
"Is that true?"

1574
00:54:02,799 --> 00:54:04,028
"They ate 17 servings?"

1575
00:54:04,029 --> 00:54:05,199
(For Fat Hiddink, 17 sounds just cute.)

1576
00:54:05,299 --> 00:54:07,499
(Humiliated)

1577
00:54:07,939 --> 00:54:09,738
(Admiring)

1578
00:54:09,739 --> 00:54:11,009
- What else?
- The other place is...

1579
00:54:11,439 --> 00:54:12,668
an omakase place.

1580
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:14,708
- There is a seafood omakase place.
- What?

1581
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:16,908
Only a few in Pyeongchang-dong know about this place.

1582
00:54:16,909 --> 00:54:18,909
- It's up to its chef.
- It's secretive.

1583
00:54:19,449 --> 00:54:20,918
(It's a secret hideout...)

1584
00:54:20,919 --> 00:54:23,418
- It's supposed to be good.
- It must have a nice vibe.

1585
00:54:23,419 --> 00:54:24,889
(that many people know about.)

1586
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:26,418
(So today's DMR is...)

1587
00:54:26,419 --> 00:54:28,089
(Dinner Menu Recommendation)

1588
00:54:28,559 --> 00:54:30,188
(Royal short ribs, the ultimate Korean beef)

1589
00:54:30,189 --> 00:54:32,059
(Seafood omakase, Pyeongchang-dong's hideout)

1590
00:54:32,229 --> 00:54:33,258
Gosh, but...

1591
00:54:33,259 --> 00:54:34,298
(It's time to choose a dish.)

1592
00:54:34,299 --> 00:54:35,798
- You should...
- You have to chug some meat.

1593
00:54:35,799 --> 00:54:37,628
You should show us how you eat meat.

1594
00:54:37,629 --> 00:54:38,729
Do you want to see it?

1595
00:54:39,929 --> 00:54:41,338
(The fans want to see Se Yoon's short-rib-eating show.)

1596
00:54:41,339 --> 00:54:42,669
- I don't know what they have.
- But...

1597
00:54:43,039 --> 00:54:44,838
A leader should think of his players.

1598
00:54:44,839 --> 00:54:47,539
He had already fought in the battle of meat, the black goat.

1599
00:54:47,909 --> 00:54:50,849
When I ask them to fight against the Korean beef again,

1600
00:54:51,279 --> 00:54:52,578
they might feel pressure.

1601
00:54:52,579 --> 00:54:53,778
(Fat Hiddink cares about his players' safety.)

1602
00:54:53,779 --> 00:54:55,118
So, I'll ask them.

1603
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:56,618
Will you fight the match of Korean beef like a man?

1604
00:54:56,619 --> 00:54:57,718
Or will you...

1605
00:54:57,719 --> 00:54:59,189
be weak and choose raw fish?

1606
00:54:59,649 --> 00:55:00,919
It's already...

1607
00:55:01,219 --> 00:55:02,418
Hasn't it already been decided?

1608
00:55:02,419 --> 00:55:04,489
- I've made my decision.
- Okay.

1609
00:55:04,659 --> 00:55:06,689
- I'll fight the Korean beef.
- Okay.

1610
00:55:07,329 --> 00:55:08,859
- Let's fight the thunder.
- Yes.

1611
00:55:08,899 --> 00:55:10,158
Let's fight the thunder.

1612
00:55:10,159 --> 00:55:11,728
- Now.
- Like a man,

1613
00:55:11,729 --> 00:55:13,128
- Okay.
- I'll head-but against it.

1614
00:55:13,129 --> 00:55:14,138
Against Korean beef?

1615
00:55:14,139 --> 00:55:16,869
(Satisfied)

1616
00:55:17,369 --> 00:55:20,269
I don't know if it's coming out from his nose or mouth.

1617
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:22,108
- Automatically...
- Yes, well.

1618
00:55:22,109 --> 00:55:23,538
- We'll get seafood omakase.
- Seafood omakase.

1619
00:55:23,539 --> 00:55:25,149
- I love seafood.
- Yes.

1620
00:55:25,349 --> 00:55:28,049
- Where are we going first?
- For dinner today,

1621
00:55:28,819 --> 00:55:31,019
we'll send the players who are ready first.

1622
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,188
It's royal short ribs.

1623
00:55:32,189 --> 00:55:33,718
- Gobbling Fat Hiddink!
- We'll eat first?

1624
00:55:33,719 --> 00:55:35,589
- Really? Okay.
- I'm ready.

1625
00:55:35,689 --> 00:55:37,158
- We can do it.
- It's two matches in a row.

1626
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:39,289
- "We can do it." - We can do it well.

1627
00:55:39,759 --> 00:55:41,228
Everyone will attack without a question.

1628
00:55:41,229 --> 00:55:42,259
(Everyone will attack without a question.)

1629
00:55:42,629 --> 00:55:44,168
- You have to score to win.
- Okay.

1630
00:55:44,169 --> 00:55:45,598
- Okay, let's go and eat.
- Let's go.

1631
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:46,729
Okay. Let's go.

1632
00:55:46,829 --> 00:55:48,498
- Let's go for the royal short ribs.
- Let's go.

1633
00:55:48,499 --> 00:55:49,769
(Shall we go and have the royal short ribs?)

1634
00:55:50,939 --> 00:55:54,009
(When the sun is about to set,)

1635
00:55:55,179 --> 00:55:58,949
(Round 1 of the dinner match begins.)

1636
00:55:59,709 --> 00:56:01,478
(The players for the royal short ribs...)

1637
00:56:01,479 --> 00:56:03,249
(are ready to go.)

1638
00:56:04,049 --> 00:56:06,019
- I think we're here.
- It's here.

1639
00:56:07,719 --> 00:56:08,888
(They enter the stadium's vicinity.)

1640
00:56:08,889 --> 00:56:12,489
The stadium for the finals looks majestic.

1641
00:56:13,389 --> 00:56:15,059
This place looks awesome.

1642
00:56:15,499 --> 00:56:17,099
- Welcome.
- Hello.

1643
00:56:18,229 --> 00:56:19,528
(At the foot of Mount Bukhan,)

1644
00:56:19,529 --> 00:56:21,299
(there is a sacred meat place that looks like a stadium.)

1645
00:56:22,139 --> 00:56:26,269
(Painting the flow of the flavors with marbling)

1646
00:56:27,439 --> 00:56:32,479
(The highest-quality Korean beef meats royal short ribs.)

1647
00:56:33,579 --> 00:56:37,488
(DMR 1: Royal short ribs)

1648
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:39,618
Okay. Let's see the menu.

1649
00:56:39,619 --> 00:56:40,919
We should order.

1650
00:56:41,589 --> 00:56:42,589
- Hello.
- Yes.

1651
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,088
- Do you sell marinated ones?
- Yes, we do.

1652
00:56:45,089 --> 00:56:47,028
Is that the only dish you have?

1653
00:56:47,029 --> 00:56:48,498
No, we have more.

1654
00:56:48,499 --> 00:56:50,629
We have a special selection of non-marinated beef too.

1655
00:56:51,169 --> 00:56:53,028
(You can check it out on the menu.)

1656
00:56:53,029 --> 00:56:54,238
- We have...
- What is this?

1657
00:56:54,239 --> 00:56:55,838
- It's the special selection.
- Don't show it to them.

1658
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:56,868
- Okay.
- We'll see it.

1659
00:56:56,869 --> 00:56:57,968
It was some dollars.

1660
00:56:57,969 --> 00:56:59,338
I mean, hundreds of dollars.

1661
00:56:59,339 --> 00:57:00,808
I saw 240 dollars.

1662
00:57:00,809 --> 00:57:01,909
It was some dollars.

1663
00:57:03,179 --> 00:57:04,708
(The match isn't going to be small.)

1664
00:57:04,709 --> 00:57:06,749
- Think before you order.
- Is it non-marinated Korean beef?

1665
00:57:07,419 --> 00:57:09,918
Shouldn't we order the assorted specialties first?

1666
00:57:09,919 --> 00:57:12,719
We'll have a normal and basic start with this one.

1667
00:57:12,989 --> 00:57:15,458
And we'll have a fantastic dance with the royal short ribs.

1668
00:57:15,459 --> 00:57:16,519
Sounds good.

1669
00:57:16,819 --> 00:57:18,588
Let's do it that way.

1670
00:57:18,589 --> 00:57:20,159
We'll order without hesitation and worrying about the money.

1671
00:57:20,529 --> 00:57:21,899
If you have marinated beef first,

1672
00:57:22,299 --> 00:57:23,559
- you'll startle your stomach.
- Right.

1673
00:57:23,729 --> 00:57:25,528
It will be a bloody match.

1674
00:57:25,529 --> 00:57:26,529
That's right.

1675
00:57:27,169 --> 00:57:28,799
I'll turn on the heat.

1676
00:57:29,099 --> 00:57:31,509
You have to turn it on to make the coal pretty.

1677
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:33,269
They do use coal.

1678
00:57:34,539 --> 00:57:36,509
- It's here.
- Nice.

1679
00:57:36,879 --> 00:57:38,009
The assorted beef is coming.

1680
00:57:38,449 --> 00:57:39,809
- Look at the color.
- Hold on.

1681
00:57:40,379 --> 00:57:41,619
The quality of the meat is insane.

1682
00:57:42,149 --> 00:57:43,219
Look at the color.

1683
00:57:44,189 --> 00:57:45,948
- This is the assorted beef.
- What is this?

1684
00:57:45,949 --> 00:57:47,388
That's the ribs.

1685
00:57:47,389 --> 00:57:49,218
- It's the assorted beef.
- Look at its marbling.

1686
00:57:49,219 --> 00:57:51,329
How could it be so fatty?

1687
00:57:51,929 --> 00:57:54,098
- Is it fake?
- That's how it looks.

1688
00:57:54,099 --> 00:57:55,528
Seriously. The color is so pretty.

1689
00:57:55,529 --> 00:57:56,699
It looks fake.

1690
00:57:57,469 --> 00:58:00,399
(The best quality Korean beef with a 2-plus, number-9 grade)

1691
00:58:01,669 --> 00:58:04,269
(Marbled ribeye, chuck flap tail, non-marinated short ribs)

1692
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:07,168
That looks really good.

1693
00:58:07,169 --> 00:58:09,878
(It's an assorted specialties with a great marbling.)

1694
00:58:09,879 --> 00:58:11,048
I'll put the meat on the grill.

1695
00:58:11,049 --> 00:58:12,149
- Okay.
- Yes.

1696
00:58:15,279 --> 00:58:17,948
(They start grilling the meat.)

1697
00:58:17,949 --> 00:58:19,849
It's cooked right away.

1698
00:58:21,989 --> 00:58:26,559
(Flipping it over right away)

1699
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:31,098
(She grills the outside slightly and keeps it rare inside.)

1700
00:58:31,099 --> 00:58:33,469
- Are you going to try it?
- Yes. Sounds good.

1701
00:58:33,999 --> 00:58:35,039
Okay.

1702
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:39,369
(After sprinkling some salt,)

1703
00:58:40,509 --> 00:58:41,578
Gosh, this is...

1704
00:58:41,579 --> 00:58:44,709
(he boldly eats two pieces at once.)

1705
00:58:49,379 --> 00:58:50,478
It's grilled perfectly.

1706
00:58:50,479 --> 00:58:51,549
(His forehead is dancing.)

1707
00:58:52,419 --> 00:58:55,419
(Sang Uk takes a bite too.)

1708
00:58:56,759 --> 00:58:57,858
It's melting.

1709
00:58:57,859 --> 00:58:59,328
(It's melting in his mouth.)

1710
00:58:59,329 --> 00:59:01,999
Gosh. It's so tender. We're in trouble.

1711
00:59:02,429 --> 00:59:03,459
You can't stop eating?

1712
00:59:04,329 --> 00:59:06,729
No. There is no brake on this.

1713
00:59:08,399 --> 00:59:11,739
(The brake to stop eating is broken due to its tenderness.)

1714
00:59:12,669 --> 00:59:14,108
My teeth are gliding through it.

1715
00:59:14,109 --> 00:59:15,238
(It's melting.)

1716
00:59:15,239 --> 00:59:16,539
They are gliding when I chew it.

1717
00:59:17,339 --> 00:59:19,178
You take two pieces no matter how big it is.

1718
00:59:19,179 --> 00:59:21,578
(Seung Ho takes a bite too.)

1719
00:59:21,579 --> 00:59:22,819
How is it, Seung Ho?

1720
00:59:24,589 --> 00:59:26,989
As expected, it melts in my mouth right away.

1721
00:59:27,719 --> 00:59:28,859
It does melt in my mouth.

1722
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,689
There's no other way to describe it.

1723
00:59:33,229 --> 00:59:37,329
You can swallow each piece after chewing it about 15 times.

1724
00:59:38,029 --> 00:59:39,628
We'll have another set of assorted specialties.

1725
00:59:39,629 --> 00:59:40,798
Please get us another one.

1726
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:42,239
So far, it's 600 dollars.

1727
00:59:42,869 --> 00:59:43,969
It's 600 dollars.

1728
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,108
It'll certainly reach over 1,000 dollars.

1729
00:59:45,109 --> 00:59:46,838
I'm so sensitive right now. What do you mean by 1,000 dollars?

1730
00:59:46,839 --> 00:59:48,709
By the looks of it, it'll be 3,000 dollars.

1731
00:59:48,939 --> 00:59:50,178
They'll reach 3,000 dollars.

1732
00:59:50,179 --> 00:59:51,708
What's shocking is that...

1733
00:59:51,709 --> 00:59:53,679
these two have already fought a match not so long ago.

1734
00:59:54,379 --> 00:59:56,378
They had a big match with the black goat.

1735
00:59:56,379 --> 00:59:57,849
(This is how they eat after the first match of lunch.)

1736
00:59:58,449 --> 01:00:00,548
- I'm grilling the vegetables...
- Here's the assorted specialties.

1737
01:00:00,549 --> 01:00:01,918
- for no reason.
- Thank you.

1738
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,919
Yes.

1739
01:00:03,459 --> 01:00:05,488
(The marbled Korean beef is placed over the coal again.)

1740
01:00:05,489 --> 01:00:06,529
Nice.

1741
01:00:09,429 --> 01:00:11,528
It's grilling nicely thanks to the strong fire.

1742
01:00:11,529 --> 01:00:12,869
(They grill it to well-done this time.)

1743
01:00:14,439 --> 01:00:16,068
It's grilled very differently than before.

1744
01:00:16,069 --> 01:00:17,069
It's different.

1745
01:00:17,070 --> 01:00:19,069
We could have grilled it even more.

1746
01:00:19,109 --> 01:00:21,238
- Tell us about the difference.
- This is how it looks.

1747
01:00:21,239 --> 01:00:22,239
(Crispy)

1748
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:23,339
The outside is crispy.

1749
01:00:24,609 --> 01:00:26,408
(He eats the well-done piece at once too.)

1750
01:00:26,409 --> 01:00:28,719
We had the black goat hot pot that we had never had before.

1751
01:00:29,149 --> 01:00:31,049
There are many dishes we haven't tried yet.

1752
01:00:32,349 --> 01:00:36,259
(Se Yoon takes a bite of it well.)

1753
01:00:38,729 --> 01:00:43,259
(Seung Ho, who prefers rare, puts a piece in his mouth.)

1754
01:00:44,269 --> 01:00:45,299
(Sighing)

1755
01:00:46,029 --> 01:00:48,239
- What is it, Se Yoon?
- Whenever I eat meat,

1756
01:00:49,139 --> 01:00:50,369
I want to live long so badly.

1757
01:00:52,309 --> 01:00:53,408
Because it's that good.

1758
01:00:53,409 --> 01:00:54,709
I want to eat it for a long time.

1759
01:00:55,279 --> 01:00:56,309
Right?

1760
01:00:56,739 --> 01:00:58,578
- You want to live long.
- Do you want to live long?

1761
01:00:58,579 --> 01:01:01,078
(The joy of good food he wants for a long time)

1762
01:01:01,079 --> 01:01:02,518
We're at a short-rib place.

1763
01:01:02,519 --> 01:01:04,049
When are you going to have it?

1764
01:01:04,249 --> 01:01:06,489
Have the marinated royal short ribs already.

1765
01:01:07,349 --> 01:01:08,889
Are you going to order three servings?

1766
01:01:08,959 --> 01:01:10,289
- We'll order 4.
- Are you going to order 4?

1767
01:01:10,719 --> 01:01:12,859
Please get us four servings of the royal short ribs.

1768
01:01:13,459 --> 01:01:14,759
I'll have one bowl of rice...

1769
01:01:15,059 --> 01:01:16,298
- when the marinated beef comes.
- I want to have...

1770
01:01:16,299 --> 01:01:17,728
Pyongyang naengmyeon later.

1771
01:01:17,729 --> 01:01:18,869
Me too.

1772
01:01:19,229 --> 01:01:20,229
Wait, what?

1773
01:01:21,269 --> 01:01:23,968
Me too. Since it's marinated, I'll eat it with a spoonful of rice.

1774
01:01:23,969 --> 01:01:25,269
- I know what you're talking about.
- Yes. Just a spoonful.

1775
01:01:25,369 --> 01:01:27,738
- We'll have 1 rice.
- Just 1 rice for now.

1776
01:01:27,739 --> 01:01:29,139
It goes well with rice.

1777
01:01:29,509 --> 01:01:32,079
It's coming. A lot of meat is coming.

1778
01:01:32,409 --> 01:01:33,878
That's it.

1779
01:01:33,879 --> 01:01:35,378
- That's the royal short ribs.
- The royal short ribs.

1780
01:01:35,379 --> 01:01:36,548
(The royal short ribs enter.)

1781
01:01:36,549 --> 01:01:37,789
- Is it...
- Is it marinated?

1782
01:01:38,289 --> 01:01:40,818
- It's lighter than expected.
- It doesn't look marinated.

1783
01:01:40,819 --> 01:01:42,759
Yes. The marinade is thinner than I thought.

1784
01:01:43,319 --> 01:01:45,158
It'll taste sweet when it's cooked.

1785
01:01:45,159 --> 01:01:48,029
The pleasing sweetness from fruits.

1786
01:01:48,399 --> 01:01:50,398
I'll grill the marinated short ribs here.

1787
01:01:50,399 --> 01:01:53,569
(It's time to eat royal short ribs.)

1788
01:01:54,269 --> 01:01:58,369
(Sizzling)

1789
01:02:00,669 --> 01:02:02,908
This is the tasty part. It has a harder texture.

1790
01:02:02,909 --> 01:02:04,709
(Cutting the well-cooked short ribs into bite-sized pieces)

1791
01:02:04,949 --> 01:02:06,508
(They're ready to eat already.)

1792
01:02:06,509 --> 01:02:08,348
- You can have it.
- Good job.

1793
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:09,418
- Can we eat it now?
- Can we?

1794
01:02:09,419 --> 01:02:10,648
- Yes, you can have it.
- Now? Okay.

1795
01:02:10,649 --> 01:02:11,819
Gosh.

1796
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:13,418
Why?

1797
01:02:13,419 --> 01:02:14,488
(Responding instantly)

1798
01:02:14,489 --> 01:02:17,419
It's the tastiest short ribs I've ever had in my life.

1799
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:18,559
What?

1800
01:02:18,689 --> 01:02:20,088
- Let me try it.
- I'll try it.

1801
01:02:20,089 --> 01:02:22,458
(Se Yoon and Sang Uk are ready to try it with excitement.)

1802
01:02:22,459 --> 01:02:24,568
- It smells so great.
- Come here.

1803
01:02:24,569 --> 01:02:25,699
You have to have it.

1804
01:02:26,129 --> 01:02:27,739
Are you the royal short ribs?

1805
01:02:29,299 --> 01:02:30,339
It's hot.

1806
01:02:31,369 --> 01:02:32,439
It's hot.

1807
01:02:34,809 --> 01:02:39,549
(The juicy meat explodes right away, starting a party in his mouth.)

1808
01:02:41,019 --> 01:02:43,619
(Taking a big bite)

1809
01:02:46,219 --> 01:02:47,648
Gosh. The marinade is not too strong or too sweet.

1810
01:02:47,649 --> 01:02:49,759
Right. It's true.

1811
01:02:49,919 --> 01:02:51,288
It's very subtle.

1812
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:53,888
It's not salty or overwhelming at all.

1813
01:02:53,889 --> 01:02:55,529
- Not at all.
- You can keep having it.

1814
01:02:55,959 --> 01:02:57,628
- With a spoon, - Yes.

1815
01:02:57,629 --> 01:02:59,728
the man who is like oxygen...

1816
01:02:59,729 --> 01:03:00,899
will make a grave.

1817
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:08,179
(He forms the bowl of rice into a round ball.)

1818
01:03:09,509 --> 01:03:10,808
He's done with mowing the grass.

1819
01:03:10,809 --> 01:03:12,548
How is it made like that?

1820
01:03:12,549 --> 01:03:13,948
- After preparing it like this, - Anyone would want to...

1821
01:03:13,949 --> 01:03:14,978
have a grave like that.

1822
01:03:14,979 --> 01:03:16,448
It's a whole garlic clove,

1823
01:03:16,449 --> 01:03:18,019
so it will go on top as part of the decoration.

1824
01:03:20,519 --> 01:03:22,419
- Great.
- Se Yoon is amazing.

1825
01:03:22,519 --> 01:03:24,428
Anything will work. Wasabi is a good choice too.

1826
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:26,189
- Garlic is nice too.
- Look at Se Yoon's.

1827
01:03:27,429 --> 01:03:28,429
I'm done.

1828
01:03:28,430 --> 01:03:29,858
- It's so big.
- Why don't we bring it together...

1829
01:03:29,859 --> 01:03:31,269
and show it to the camera?

1830
01:03:31,629 --> 01:03:35,399
My grave-like friend

1831
01:03:35,469 --> 01:03:36,599
Okay!

1832
01:03:37,169 --> 01:03:38,338
Gosh, how do I put this in?

1833
01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:40,469
(Taking a big bite together)

1834
01:03:40,639 --> 01:03:41,809
It goes in like that.

1835
01:03:42,609 --> 01:03:43,738
(Eating)

1836
01:03:43,739 --> 01:03:44,909
It goes in like that.

1837
01:03:45,479 --> 01:03:46,549
It gets shoved in.

1838
01:03:52,789 --> 01:03:55,618
(Touched)

1839
01:03:55,619 --> 01:03:56,818
Gosh, that must be good.

1840
01:03:56,819 --> 01:03:59,328
(Gulping)

1841
01:03:59,329 --> 01:04:00,358
Eunuch Kim.

1842
01:04:00,359 --> 01:04:03,398
Yes, your Majesty!

1843
01:04:03,399 --> 01:04:05,098
Check my commode!

1844
01:04:05,099 --> 01:04:06,929
(The king's toilet)

1845
01:04:07,499 --> 01:04:09,168
Your commode is full.

1846
01:04:09,169 --> 01:04:11,038
It's full!

1847
01:04:11,039 --> 01:04:12,509
You lied, you fool!

1848
01:04:13,169 --> 01:04:14,878
I did not eat enough to fill it up today!

1849
01:04:14,879 --> 01:04:16,638
(I did not eat enough to fill it up today!)

1850
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,708
(Eunuch Kim)

1851
01:04:17,709 --> 01:04:19,208
It has been changed to the grand size...

1852
01:04:19,209 --> 01:04:20,709
as it was always filled.

1853
01:04:21,949 --> 01:04:23,819
I saw that the others were given a piece.

1854
01:04:23,949 --> 01:04:26,089
This is the last place.

1855
01:04:26,389 --> 01:04:27,689
- From one...
- Right.

1856
01:04:27,789 --> 01:04:29,289
- to ten, - Yes?

1857
01:04:29,659 --> 01:04:31,429
what is the number Moon Se Yoon is thinking about right now?

1858
01:04:32,029 --> 01:04:33,128
Eight!

1859
01:04:33,129 --> 01:04:34,498
(What is the number Moon Se Yoon is thinking about right now?)

1860
01:04:34,499 --> 01:04:35,799
- Two.
- Right!

1861
01:04:36,159 --> 01:04:37,599
- Four.
- Four!

1862
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,928
There is one person that got it right.

1863
01:04:39,929 --> 01:04:41,298
(There is one person that got it right.)

1864
01:04:41,299 --> 01:04:42,568
But what kind of question is this?

1865
01:04:42,569 --> 01:04:45,238
(But what kind of question is this?)

1866
01:04:45,239 --> 01:04:47,008
- What is this?
- I just realized this.

1867
01:04:47,009 --> 01:04:48,339
I came up with it ten seconds ago.

1868
01:04:48,479 --> 01:04:51,808
I came up with it ten seconds ago.

1869
01:04:51,809 --> 01:04:52,848
The number that I'm thinking about is...

1870
01:04:52,849 --> 01:04:54,579
- Are you serious?
- I'm serious.

1871
01:04:55,119 --> 01:04:58,248
- Number 8, 2, or 4.
- There's an answer?

1872
01:04:58,249 --> 01:05:00,148
- Congratulations!
- There's an answer?

1873
01:05:00,149 --> 01:05:01,259
It's number two!

1874
01:05:02,359 --> 01:05:03,558
It's number two!

1875
01:05:03,559 --> 01:05:05,058
(Yi Kyung wins.)

1876
01:05:05,059 --> 01:05:06,659
But there's no way to check.

1877
01:05:06,889 --> 01:05:08,199
- There's no way to check.
- But...

1878
01:05:08,429 --> 01:05:10,098
I am humbled by your mercy.

1879
01:05:10,099 --> 01:05:12,228
Right. What is your name?

1880
01:05:12,229 --> 01:05:13,268
I am Yi Kyung, your Majesty.

1881
01:05:13,269 --> 01:05:14,538
So you are Yi Kyung.

1882
01:05:14,539 --> 01:05:15,598
You may eat.

1883
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:16,899
(You may eat.)

1884
01:05:16,969 --> 01:05:18,569
Yi Kyung got it right.

1885
01:05:19,069 --> 01:05:20,568
Even while calling out the answer,

1886
01:05:20,569 --> 01:05:21,809
I wondered what kind of question this was.

1887
01:05:22,379 --> 01:05:24,138
(Dong Hyun is disappointed.)

1888
01:05:24,139 --> 01:05:25,409
My gosh.

1889
01:05:25,449 --> 01:05:27,709
- Dong Hyun, who is...
- Yes?

1890
01:05:27,949 --> 01:05:29,249
my favorite female singer?

1891
01:05:30,279 --> 01:05:31,488
(Who is Se Yoon's favorite female solo singer?)

1892
01:05:31,489 --> 01:05:33,088
- She's a solo singer.
- Taeyeon!

1893
01:05:33,089 --> 01:05:34,388
- Incorrect!
- What?

1894
01:05:34,389 --> 01:05:35,518
It's Noh Sa Yeon.

1895
01:05:35,519 --> 01:05:37,219
My gosh!

1896
01:05:37,859 --> 01:05:39,628
(How am I supposed to know that?)

1897
01:05:39,629 --> 01:05:41,728
- Gosh.
- How am I supposed to know that?

1898
01:05:41,729 --> 01:05:43,859
Which category are you confident in?

1899
01:05:43,899 --> 01:05:44,811
- Me?
- Yes.

1900
01:05:44,999 --> 01:05:46,498
Variety shows.

1901
01:05:46,499 --> 01:05:48,598
Things related to the entertainment industry.

1902
01:05:48,599 --> 01:05:49,968
- Variety shows?
- The entertainment industry.

1903
01:05:49,969 --> 01:05:51,268
- The entertainment industry?
- Yes.

1904
01:05:51,269 --> 01:05:52,338
You have chosen the entertainment industry.

1905
01:05:52,339 --> 01:05:56,179
- Great.
- "Star Golden Bell..."

1906
01:05:56,209 --> 01:05:57,839
- was a KBS show.
- Right.

1907
01:05:58,349 --> 01:06:00,349
How many stars appeared in that show?

1908
01:06:00,709 --> 01:06:01,779
My gosh.

1909
01:06:02,979 --> 01:06:04,018
(Speechless)

1910
01:06:04,019 --> 01:06:05,118
Make a guess.

1911
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:07,248
- In total?
- It's 2,750.

1912
01:06:07,249 --> 01:06:08,988
- How many?
- It's 2,750.

1913
01:06:08,989 --> 01:06:10,188
I'm sorry.

1914
01:06:10,189 --> 01:06:11,328
- Incorrect!
- Gosh.

1915
01:06:11,329 --> 01:06:13,128
You have to tell us the right answer.

1916
01:06:13,129 --> 01:06:15,628
- The answer is "unknown." - Gosh.

1917
01:06:15,629 --> 01:06:17,228
It's because...

1918
01:06:17,229 --> 01:06:18,898
there are people who just became stars.

1919
01:06:18,899 --> 01:06:20,228
Why would've gone with this question?

1920
01:06:20,229 --> 01:06:21,939
(Totally agreeing)

1921
01:06:22,499 --> 01:06:23,538
The bill.

1922
01:06:23,539 --> 01:06:27,509
(It's time to check the bill.)

1923
01:06:27,539 --> 01:06:29,338
I think the record is broken.

1924
01:06:29,339 --> 01:06:30,809
He's shaking his hands out of fear.

1925
01:06:32,246 --> 01:06:33,305
The bill.

1926
01:06:33,306 --> 01:06:37,216
(It's time to check the bill.)

1927
01:06:37,276 --> 01:06:39,085
I think the record is broken.

1928
01:06:39,086 --> 01:06:40,646
He's shaking his hands out of fear.

1929
01:06:41,656 --> 01:06:42,915
It's 823 dollars.

1930
01:06:42,916 --> 01:06:44,556
- That's just right.
- It's 823 dollars.

1931
01:06:44,631 --> 01:06:46,661
It's 823 dollars for 3? Gosh.

1932
01:06:46,686 --> 01:06:47,826
(Bill: Total of 823 dollars)

1933
01:06:48,226 --> 01:06:49,595
Here's the question.

1934
01:06:49,596 --> 01:06:51,256
The royal short ribs quiz.

1935
01:06:51,626 --> 01:06:54,466
In the royal kitchen of the Joseon Dynasty,

1936
01:06:54,726 --> 01:06:58,135
- there were around 200 cooks.
- Right.

1937
01:06:58,136 --> 01:06:59,865
These people were given different names...

1938
01:06:59,866 --> 01:07:01,675
based on the dishes they were in charge of.

1939
01:07:01,676 --> 01:07:04,376
The cook in charge of cooking meat was called Byulsaong.

1940
01:07:04,536 --> 01:07:05,975
- Sorry?
- "Byulsaong."

1941
01:07:05,976 --> 01:07:07,375
- Yes. "Byulsaong." - "Ong?"

1942
01:07:07,376 --> 01:07:10,275
The one in charge of making alcoholic drinks was called Jusaek.

1943
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:11,485
- "Jusaek." - Right.

1944
01:07:11,486 --> 01:07:14,115
Then what were Bangong and Juksaek...

1945
01:07:14,116 --> 01:07:16,485
in charge of?

1946
01:07:16,486 --> 01:07:18,116
- We have to answer both of them?
- Yes.

1947
01:07:18,626 --> 01:07:19,275
This is a hard one.

1948
01:07:20,026 --> 01:07:21,755
(Thinking)

1949
01:07:21,756 --> 01:07:24,625
Look. The ones in charge of the meat and drinks were mentioned.

1950
01:07:24,626 --> 01:07:27,166
I think the ones left are the rice and side dishes.

1951
01:07:28,066 --> 01:07:29,266
That sounds right.

1952
01:07:29,296 --> 01:07:30,435
"Bangong."

1953
01:07:30,436 --> 01:07:32,565
That sounds similar to "half a bowl of rice."

1954
01:07:32,566 --> 01:07:33,705
As for Juksaek,

1955
01:07:33,706 --> 01:07:35,475
my grandmother...

1956
01:07:35,476 --> 01:07:37,935
- calls jeon as juk.
- Right.

1957
01:07:37,936 --> 01:07:39,075
"Let's make some juk."

1958
01:07:39,076 --> 01:07:40,306
- "Sanjuk." - Right.

1959
01:07:40,446 --> 01:07:41,546
Different types of juk.

1960
01:07:41,646 --> 01:07:42,975
- That is all I can think of.
- Right.

1961
01:07:42,976 --> 01:07:44,115
Juk is related to meat.

1962
01:07:44,116 --> 01:07:46,185
It doesn't seem like the one who makes the jeon.

1963
01:07:46,186 --> 01:07:47,746
(It doesn't seem like the one who makes the jeon.)

1964
01:07:47,986 --> 01:07:49,656
(Peeking)

1965
01:07:49,716 --> 01:07:51,115
It was great when they ate.

1966
01:07:51,116 --> 01:07:52,285
I hoped that it would be mentioned but it wasn't.

1967
01:07:52,286 --> 01:07:53,856
It was great when they ate.

1968
01:07:54,326 --> 01:07:56,596
Their faces have changed totally.

1969
01:07:57,056 --> 01:07:58,666
Your faces look a lot different from when you guys were eating.

1970
01:07:58,996 --> 01:08:00,125
Who wouldn't feel scared?

1971
01:08:00,126 --> 01:08:01,596
(Who wouldn't feel scared?)

1972
01:08:01,836 --> 01:08:03,936
(There are 800 dollars on the line.)

1973
01:08:04,196 --> 01:08:05,466
Let's make a decision. We have to guess.

1974
01:08:05,536 --> 01:08:07,506
All right. Let's guess.

1975
01:08:07,566 --> 01:08:09,105
- All right.
- Side dish.

1976
01:08:09,106 --> 01:08:10,905
Bangong for the rice and Juksaek for the side dishes.

1977
01:08:10,906 --> 01:08:13,005
- We're going with that, right?
- Okay.

1978
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:14,675
Bangong for the rice...

1979
01:08:14,676 --> 01:08:15,915
(Answer: Bangong for rice, Juksaek for side dishes)

1980
01:08:15,916 --> 01:08:17,146
and Juksaek for the side dishes.

1981
01:08:17,316 --> 01:08:18,585
Is it correct for rice?

1982
01:08:18,586 --> 01:08:19,845
Bangong...

1983
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:21,145
I think we'll get it wrong for this one.

1984
01:08:21,146 --> 01:08:22,886
is the one in charge of making the rice.

1985
01:08:23,456 --> 01:08:24,515
- Correct.
- Okay!

1986
01:08:24,516 --> 01:08:25,686
- We're right?
- Gosh!

1987
01:08:25,886 --> 01:08:26,985
- That was the right answer?
- All right.

1988
01:08:26,986 --> 01:08:28,625
- That person made the rice?
- We have to get up for this.

1989
01:08:28,626 --> 01:08:30,056
We have to get up for this one.

1990
01:08:30,226 --> 01:08:31,395
- Gosh.
- Get together.

1991
01:08:31,396 --> 01:08:33,126
- No way.
- We just need to get one right.

1992
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:35,165
The bill worth 800 dollars will be handed over to us.

1993
01:08:35,166 --> 01:08:36,596
(The bill worth 800 dollars will be handed over to us.)

1994
01:08:36,936 --> 01:08:38,405
- What is the answer?
- Juksaek.

1995
01:08:38,406 --> 01:08:39,466
Juksaek!

1996
01:08:39,506 --> 01:08:40,665
The one in charge of the side dishes.

1997
01:08:40,666 --> 01:08:41,735
(Answer: Bangong for rice, Juksaek for side dishes)

1998
01:08:41,736 --> 01:08:43,135
- No way.
- I think they're right.

1999
01:08:43,136 --> 01:08:45,275
(Answer: Bangong for rice, Juksaek for side dishes)

2000
01:08:45,276 --> 01:08:46,446
That is incorrect.

2001
01:08:46,776 --> 01:08:48,275
- My gosh!
- Gosh.

2002
01:08:48,276 --> 01:08:49,775
I told you not to say it like that!

2003
01:08:49,776 --> 01:08:51,615
- Come on - I got so surprised!

2004
01:08:51,616 --> 01:08:52,645
(It's an individual quiz with the same question.)

2005
01:08:52,646 --> 01:08:54,586
This person was in charge of a method of cooking.

2006
01:08:54,816 --> 01:08:56,715
Guess what kind of method it was.

2007
01:08:56,716 --> 01:08:58,326
- Frying.
- Incorrect.

2008
01:08:59,056 --> 01:09:00,186
I got it.

2009
01:09:00,786 --> 01:09:01,855
Grilling.

2010
01:09:01,856 --> 01:09:02,956
Grilling?

2011
01:09:03,226 --> 01:09:04,455
The one in charge of grilling?

2012
01:09:04,456 --> 01:09:05,495
(Answer: Grilling)

2013
01:09:05,496 --> 01:09:06,596
Correct.

2014
01:09:07,296 --> 01:09:09,365
That was so close!

2015
01:09:09,366 --> 01:09:10,565
(Disappointed)

2016
01:09:10,566 --> 01:09:12,265
Grilling? Why is that related to "Juk?"

2017
01:09:12,266 --> 01:09:13,335
Frying and grilling?

2018
01:09:13,336 --> 01:09:14,366
"Juk" is the character for grilling.

2019
01:09:14,766 --> 01:09:16,205
That's the character for grilling?

2020
01:09:16,206 --> 01:09:17,775
- You were right about "sanjuk." - Right.

2021
01:09:17,776 --> 01:09:19,206
It's a 1-on-1 match with 800 dollars on the line.

2022
01:09:19,506 --> 01:09:20,675
Gosh, Se Yoon!

2023
01:09:20,676 --> 01:09:22,675
- How will Se Yoon do?
- Right.

2024
01:09:22,676 --> 01:09:23,746
It's for 800 dollars!

2025
01:09:24,076 --> 01:09:25,786
- Here's the question then.
- Okay!

2026
01:09:26,216 --> 01:09:29,486
Cows are well-developed with the idea of social hierarchy.

2027
01:09:29,816 --> 01:09:30,885
- Cows.
- Recently,

2028
01:09:30,886 --> 01:09:32,355
a foreign research team...

2029
01:09:32,356 --> 01:09:34,586
performed a research on the social hierarchy of cows...

2030
01:09:34,726 --> 01:09:38,156
and found out that cows have best friends.

2031
01:09:39,296 --> 01:09:40,895
The cows that were family members were best friends.

2032
01:09:40,896 --> 01:09:41,936
Family members.

2033
01:09:42,436 --> 01:09:43,665
Additionally,

2034
01:09:43,666 --> 01:09:46,566
cows that had similar "blanks" were best friends too.

2035
01:09:47,266 --> 01:09:49,976
- I got it!
- "What's the word in the blank?"

2036
01:09:50,076 --> 01:09:51,205
Let's think about this.

2037
01:09:51,206 --> 01:09:53,476
Which parts of cows are charming?

2038
01:09:54,046 --> 01:09:55,176
The eyes.

2039
01:09:55,476 --> 01:09:57,075
Where are their eyes looking?

2040
01:09:57,076 --> 01:09:58,886
They look at each others' eyes.

2041
01:09:58,946 --> 01:10:00,145
It's the eyes.

2042
01:10:00,146 --> 01:10:01,785
- That sounds right.
- This doesn't feel good.

2043
01:10:01,786 --> 01:10:03,086
This doesn't feel good.

2044
01:10:03,386 --> 01:10:04,956
The eyes.

2045
01:10:06,286 --> 01:10:08,896
The eyes.

2046
01:10:09,256 --> 01:10:10,695
- The eyes.
- Gosh.

2047
01:10:10,696 --> 01:10:11,995
How could you do that?

2048
01:10:11,996 --> 01:10:13,325
The cows that had similar eyes were best friends.

2049
01:10:13,326 --> 01:10:14,365
No way!

2050
01:10:14,366 --> 01:10:15,495
- Does that make sense?
- Really?

2051
01:10:15,496 --> 01:10:16,635
That must be right.

2052
01:10:16,636 --> 01:10:17,895
- Incorrect.
- Gosh.

2053
01:10:17,896 --> 01:10:19,966
- That's not the right answer?
- I can't believe it.

2054
01:10:20,036 --> 01:10:21,676
- This is my answer.
- What is it?

2055
01:10:22,736 --> 01:10:23,806
Their passing?

2056
01:10:23,876 --> 01:10:25,045
- Their passing?
- Their passing?

2057
01:10:25,046 --> 01:10:27,376
- The ones that...
- The ones that die on the same day?

2058
01:10:27,606 --> 01:10:28,776
How is that possible?

2059
01:10:28,846 --> 01:10:30,146
They become best friends after death?

2060
01:10:30,316 --> 01:10:32,085
- Best friends in paradise?
- Come on, Sang Uk!

2061
01:10:32,086 --> 01:10:33,545
They realize that they are getting old together...

2062
01:10:33,546 --> 01:10:36,456
and agree not to be lonely together before death.

2063
01:10:36,786 --> 01:10:39,125
- Get out your card, Sang Uk.
- Gosh, Sang Uk.

2064
01:10:39,126 --> 01:10:40,356
- I got it.
- Right.

2065
01:10:40,886 --> 01:10:43,595
I'm getting goosebumps.

2066
01:10:43,596 --> 01:10:44,995
- Why?
- Okay.

2067
01:10:44,996 --> 01:10:46,626
- I'm so smart.
- What is it?

2068
01:10:46,866 --> 01:10:48,695
Look at them. What's common between them?

2069
01:10:48,696 --> 01:10:50,736
Best friends must be similar in style.

2070
01:10:51,136 --> 01:10:52,366
Let's say I'm a cow that likes white T-shirts...

2071
01:10:52,406 --> 01:10:53,406
and I see him wearing a white T-shirt.

2072
01:10:54,266 --> 01:10:55,405
- We must have a lot to share about.
- Right.

2073
01:10:55,406 --> 01:10:57,436
"Hey, you like white T-shirts too?"

2074
01:10:57,476 --> 01:10:58,606
"Let's shake hands."

2075
01:10:58,876 --> 01:11:00,906
"I like layering clothes too."

2076
01:11:01,446 --> 01:11:03,016
"Do you like boots or sneakers?"

2077
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:04,815
They must be similar in style.

2078
01:11:04,816 --> 01:11:06,745
The cows that look similar.

2079
01:11:06,746 --> 01:11:09,485
Friends that are similar in color.

2080
01:11:09,486 --> 01:11:10,615
- Incorrect!
- Gosh!

2081
01:11:10,616 --> 01:11:12,185
(Incorrect)

2082
01:11:12,186 --> 01:11:13,855
- That sounded so reasonable though.
- Gosh.

2083
01:11:13,856 --> 01:11:15,495
That was such a long description.

2084
01:11:15,496 --> 01:11:16,695
That's how he gives his answers.

2085
01:11:16,696 --> 01:11:17,756
I got it.

2086
01:11:19,096 --> 01:11:20,325
Is it...

2087
01:11:20,326 --> 01:11:21,465
the time periods of when they were born?

2088
01:11:21,466 --> 01:11:22,595
The time periods of when they were born?

2089
01:11:22,596 --> 01:11:24,495
(Answer: Time periods of when they were born)

2090
01:11:24,496 --> 01:11:25,565
Correct.

2091
01:11:25,566 --> 01:11:28,366
(Answer: Time periods of when they were born)

2092
01:11:29,306 --> 01:11:30,435
What?

2093
01:11:30,436 --> 01:11:31,635
(Flustered)

2094
01:11:31,636 --> 01:11:32,905
- But...
- Really?

2095
01:11:32,906 --> 01:11:34,006
You first mentioned their times of passing.

2096
01:11:34,476 --> 01:11:35,675
You then went with the time periods of when they were born.

2097
01:11:35,676 --> 01:11:37,215
(Everyone gets amazed.)

2098
01:11:37,216 --> 01:11:38,945
- He never disappoints.
- Well...

2099
01:11:38,946 --> 01:11:41,316
He looks like Agwi from "Tazza."

2100
01:11:41,346 --> 01:11:42,685
He looks just like Agwi.

2101
01:11:42,686 --> 01:11:43,816
I definitely saw it.

2102
01:11:44,186 --> 01:11:45,826
- It's Agwi.
- I definitely saw it.

2103
01:11:45,856 --> 01:11:47,956
- Gosh.
- No. I definitely saw it.

2104
01:11:48,496 --> 01:11:51,026
No. It's not 823 dollars.

2105
01:11:51,426 --> 01:11:53,525
It's not this amount. I definitely saw it.

2106
01:11:53,526 --> 01:11:54,765
Give me your hand!

2107
01:11:54,766 --> 01:11:56,035
Give me your hand!

2108
01:11:56,036 --> 01:11:57,096
I'm sorry!

2109
01:11:57,996 --> 01:12:00,105
Money shouldn't be used like this!

2110
01:12:00,106 --> 01:12:01,636
(Money shouldn't be used like this!)

2111
01:12:02,476 --> 01:12:03,606
Gosh, Sang Uk.

2112
01:12:03,776 --> 01:12:05,075
You did really well.

2113
01:12:05,076 --> 01:12:06,106
Hold on.

2114
01:12:06,306 --> 01:12:08,075
That means they are close when they are family members...

2115
01:12:08,076 --> 01:12:09,716
or born around the same time period.

2116
01:12:10,216 --> 01:12:12,016
That was a great battle. I have no regrets.

2117
01:12:12,286 --> 01:12:14,685
I'm happy to pay after a good fight.

2118
01:12:14,686 --> 01:12:16,586
- That was a great battle.
- It really was.

2119
01:12:16,986 --> 01:12:19,686
The greatest bill will be paid by a guest and not a member.

2120
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:22,395
- He will break the record.
- This will go on for a while.

2121
01:12:22,396 --> 01:12:23,396
It will.

2122
01:12:23,826 --> 01:12:25,666
Let's head out for the next battle.

2123
01:12:25,726 --> 01:12:27,466
- Let's go.
- Give us a lot of quizzes.

2124
01:12:28,896 --> 01:12:30,065
(Receipt: Total of 823 dollars)

2125
01:12:30,066 --> 01:12:31,066
My signature.

2126
01:12:31,596 --> 01:12:32,665
Gosh, thank you for the meal.

2127
01:12:32,666 --> 01:12:34,335
- Don't mention it.
- I really enjoyed the food.

2128
01:12:34,336 --> 01:12:35,336
Don't mention it.

2129
01:12:35,337 --> 01:12:37,076
(The first DMR meal ends.)

2130
01:12:37,536 --> 01:12:40,706
(It's fully dark outside now.)

2131
01:12:41,676 --> 01:12:47,046
(The night of Pyeongchang-dong goes by peacefully.)

2132
01:12:48,286 --> 01:12:49,885
(To the second DMR!)

2133
01:12:49,886 --> 01:12:51,826
I'm curious. I love seafood.

2134
01:12:52,426 --> 01:12:54,256
Where is the omakase place here?

2135
01:12:55,026 --> 01:12:57,156
Shouldn't we be seeing it around now?

2136
01:12:57,356 --> 01:12:58,626
But this place...

2137
01:12:58,896 --> 01:13:00,365
is a place for regulars.

2138
01:13:00,366 --> 01:13:02,536
It seems like a place that experts come to.

2139
01:13:03,066 --> 01:13:04,795
- Is it this place?
- Is it this place?

2140
01:13:04,796 --> 01:13:06,306
No. This is a cafe.

2141
01:13:06,966 --> 01:13:08,236
This must be it.

2142
01:13:08,606 --> 01:13:09,675
- The sign...
- Gosh!

2143
01:13:09,676 --> 01:13:10,676
- This place is stunning.
- You won't be able to...

2144
01:13:10,676 --> 01:13:11,676
even search this place.

2145
01:13:11,677 --> 01:13:13,975
This was the place I saw on a blog post.

2146
01:13:13,976 --> 01:13:15,415
- In Pyeongchang-dong?
- Right.

2147
01:13:15,416 --> 01:13:17,145
- It says, "Creative Cuisine." - It's intense.

2148
01:13:17,146 --> 01:13:18,786
(It arouses your curiosity even before getting in.)

2149
01:13:19,446 --> 01:13:22,215
(It has the vibes of a jazz bar...)

2150
01:13:22,216 --> 01:13:25,786
(as an omakase restaurant.)

2151
01:13:26,356 --> 01:13:28,696
(There's just a fish as the sign.)

2152
01:13:29,056 --> 01:13:31,356
(There is only one table as well.)

2153
01:13:32,196 --> 01:13:33,295
It's a place that feels comfortable.

2154
01:13:33,296 --> 01:13:34,595
I feel comfortable here.

2155
01:13:34,596 --> 01:13:37,436
It's a place I come to whenever I need something to eat.

2156
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:40,236
No one else has done this.

2157
01:13:41,066 --> 01:13:42,835
This place serves dishes...

2158
01:13:42,836 --> 01:13:45,446
that no one has ever dared to make.

2159
01:13:45,506 --> 01:13:50,316
There are dishes here that you will never find elsewhere.

2160
01:13:50,446 --> 01:13:51,745
When you come in...

2161
01:13:51,746 --> 01:13:53,785
and ask the owner to make you the same dish you had,

2162
01:13:53,786 --> 01:13:55,016
he won't remember it.

2163
01:13:55,356 --> 01:13:57,455
A completely new dish will be served.

2164
01:13:57,456 --> 01:14:00,356
This place would be great for those...

2165
01:14:00,726 --> 01:14:01,855
who want to experience something new.

2166
01:14:01,856 --> 01:14:03,956
(DMR 2, Owner's Omakase)

2167
01:14:04,526 --> 01:14:06,195
- This place feels like...
- What is this place?

2168
01:14:06,196 --> 01:14:08,696
- It doesn't feel like a restaurant.
- Definitely not.

2169
01:14:09,036 --> 01:14:11,905
Omakase restaurants usually have bar tables.

2170
01:14:11,906 --> 01:14:13,766
(Most omakase restaurants look like this.)

2171
01:14:14,106 --> 01:14:15,535
What kind of place is this?

2172
01:14:15,536 --> 01:14:17,375
(They are filled with question marks even before the start.)

2173
01:14:17,376 --> 01:14:20,375
There's also a guitar and bongos.

2174
01:14:20,376 --> 01:14:21,875
After having a glass,

2175
01:14:21,876 --> 01:14:24,445
this place must turn into a concert.

2176
01:14:24,446 --> 01:14:25,786
- He must sing too.
- Right.

2177
01:14:25,846 --> 01:14:27,146
He must enjoy playing instruments.

2178
01:14:27,746 --> 01:14:29,315
- Gosh.
- This place...

2179
01:14:29,316 --> 01:14:31,216
- Hello.
- Hello.

2180
01:14:31,616 --> 01:14:32,826
- We will...
- The owner is here.

2181
01:14:33,056 --> 01:14:34,155
Hello.

2182
01:14:34,156 --> 01:14:35,425
- Gosh.
- He has such a great presence.

2183
01:14:35,426 --> 01:14:38,495
(They get startled by his great presence.)

2184
01:14:38,496 --> 01:14:39,866
He's a fashionista.

2185
01:14:40,266 --> 01:14:41,936
- It's great to see you all.
- Hello.

2186
01:14:42,696 --> 01:14:44,865
It feels like...

2187
01:14:44,866 --> 01:14:46,966
- you are a musician.
- You look like an artist.

2188
01:14:47,336 --> 01:14:49,006
Well, life is a work of art.

2189
01:14:50,576 --> 01:14:52,145
(Touched)

2190
01:14:52,146 --> 01:14:54,076
Are you a musician?

2191
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:55,515
I do a lot of things.

2192
01:14:55,516 --> 01:14:56,875
- I listen to music too.
- I see.

2193
01:14:56,876 --> 01:14:57,915
Right.

2194
01:14:57,916 --> 01:14:59,745
- I enjoy being on my motorbike.
- I see.

2195
01:14:59,746 --> 01:15:02,285
- Music?
- I go scuba diving too.

2196
01:15:02,286 --> 01:15:03,686
- Those are his hobbies.
- I enjoy climbing too.

2197
01:15:03,856 --> 01:15:05,385
He's full of hobbies.

2198
01:15:05,386 --> 01:15:07,386
- Right.
- Do you happen to be single?

2199
01:15:07,526 --> 01:15:10,526
- Since you have so many hobbies.
- Right. You have so many hobbies.

2200
01:15:10,956 --> 01:15:12,696
I met a woman that is full of mercy.

2201
01:15:12,826 --> 01:15:15,165
(Impressed)

2202
01:15:15,166 --> 01:15:16,595
It was possible because he was full of charms.

2203
01:15:16,596 --> 01:15:18,906
Right. It works both ways.

2204
01:15:19,106 --> 01:15:20,235
His life is truly a work of art.

2205
01:15:20,236 --> 01:15:21,806
But...

2206
01:15:22,236 --> 01:15:25,005
- What is this place?
- What is this place?

2207
01:15:25,006 --> 01:15:27,546
What do you sell in this place?

2208
01:15:27,876 --> 01:15:29,015
I sell myself.

2209
01:15:29,016 --> 01:15:31,945
(I sell myself.)

2210
01:15:31,946 --> 01:15:33,615
Oneness with nature.

2211
01:15:33,616 --> 01:15:35,916
(His oneness with nature is touching.)

2212
01:15:36,386 --> 01:15:39,726
- He feels so composed.
- He lives so freely.

2213
01:15:40,226 --> 01:15:42,695
How long has this place been run?

2214
01:15:42,696 --> 01:15:43,755
(How long has this place been run?)

2215
01:15:43,756 --> 01:15:46,766
I started this place in 2001.

2216
01:15:47,266 --> 01:15:49,666
- It has been around 24 years.
- Right.

2217
01:15:49,766 --> 01:15:51,636
I did move around quite a bit.

2218
01:15:52,236 --> 01:15:54,236
But I've been here for a while.

2219
01:15:54,736 --> 01:15:55,905
He moved around.

2220
01:15:55,906 --> 01:15:57,076
(A place that became a playground for many customers)

2221
01:15:57,406 --> 01:16:00,075
How do we order here?

2222
01:16:00,076 --> 01:16:02,715
We are aware that this place is an omakase restaurant, but...

2223
01:16:02,716 --> 01:16:04,046
- I have things prepared...
- Right.

2224
01:16:04,276 --> 01:16:05,945
and you just eat what I serve you. This is what it's like here.

2225
01:16:05,946 --> 01:16:07,345
- Really?
- Eat what gets served.

2226
01:16:07,346 --> 01:16:08,346
(That's so impressive.)

2227
01:16:08,347 --> 01:16:09,655
- Really?
- Gosh.

2228
01:16:09,656 --> 01:16:10,715
- Let's go for it.
- I have a question.

2229
01:16:10,716 --> 01:16:14,285
How much is the owner's omakase per person?

2230
01:16:14,286 --> 01:16:15,756
(How much is it for each person?)

2231
01:16:16,096 --> 01:16:17,556
- I run this place alone.
- Right.

2232
01:16:18,296 --> 01:16:20,296
(Worried)

2233
01:16:20,596 --> 01:16:22,995
(It feels like t will be quite expensive.)

2234
01:16:22,996 --> 01:16:25,365
Asking for just 50 dollars felt reasonable.

2235
01:16:25,366 --> 01:16:27,306
(It's 50 dollars for 1 person.)

2236
01:16:27,506 --> 01:16:28,566
- What?
- What?

2237
01:16:29,506 --> 01:16:30,606
- What?
- It's 50 dollars?

2238
01:16:30,706 --> 01:16:31,905
(He chokes up after feeling surprised.)

2239
01:16:31,906 --> 01:16:33,745
There are no labor costs spent as I'm the only one here.

2240
01:16:33,746 --> 01:16:35,775
- But...
- But 50 dollars sounds too...

2241
01:16:35,776 --> 01:16:36,776
How is the food served here?

2242
01:16:36,777 --> 01:16:38,615
(Dumbfounded by the shocking price)

2243
01:16:38,616 --> 01:16:41,685
How many courses are served in general?

2244
01:16:41,686 --> 01:16:43,856
I serve everything I have if I'm in a good mood.

2245
01:16:44,056 --> 01:16:45,156
I see.

2246
01:16:45,486 --> 01:16:47,455
- Gosh.
- This place...

2247
01:16:47,456 --> 01:16:48,926
is going to become really popular.

2248
01:16:49,456 --> 01:16:53,366
Then the three of us will go with your omakase.

2249
01:16:53,726 --> 01:16:56,035
We will wait right here without asking any questions.

2250
01:16:56,036 --> 01:16:57,935
- I'm so curious.
- Thank you.

2251
01:16:57,936 --> 01:16:59,936
- Thank you.
- I'm so curious about the food.

2252
01:17:00,336 --> 01:17:02,135
It leaves just a big question mark.

2253
01:17:02,136 --> 01:17:03,875
It's so fascinating. I've never been to a place like this.

2254
01:17:03,876 --> 01:17:05,336
(The owner heads to the kitchen after leaving many question marks!)

2255
01:17:08,676 --> 01:17:12,446
(Yi Kyung heads somewhere all of a sudden.)

2256
01:17:12,586 --> 01:17:14,286
Se Yoon! Don't you know how to play the guitar?

2257
01:17:14,316 --> 01:17:16,186
- Just a little.
- He plays the guitar well.

2258
01:17:16,216 --> 01:17:17,256
- Just a little.
- Show us.

2259
01:17:17,586 --> 01:17:20,355
But I can only play two things.

2260
01:17:20,356 --> 01:17:22,295
- Show us a little.
- I can only play two things.

2261
01:17:22,296 --> 01:17:23,556
I'm not sure if it's tuned.

2262
01:17:23,656 --> 01:17:26,066
Does anyone else know how to play? I'm not very good.

2263
01:17:26,166 --> 01:17:27,665
I know how to play just a little.

2264
01:17:27,666 --> 01:17:28,995
- Show us a little then.
- It would look great...

2265
01:17:28,996 --> 01:17:30,365
if Sang Uk plays the guitar.

2266
01:17:30,366 --> 01:17:31,496
(It would look great if Sang Uk plays the guitar.)

2267
01:17:31,596 --> 01:17:32,935
This is "Instinctively."

2268
01:17:32,936 --> 01:17:35,065
(Sang Uk's choice of song, "Instinctively")

2269
01:17:35,066 --> 01:17:36,876
(Drumming)

2270
01:17:38,176 --> 01:17:40,505
(A sudden collaboration between Yi Kyung and Sang Uk)

2271
01:17:40,506 --> 01:17:41,506
There you go.

2272
01:17:41,976 --> 01:17:43,446
This is how the customers use this place.

2273
01:17:43,516 --> 01:17:44,875
I see.

2274
01:17:44,876 --> 01:17:45,886
(They now understand how people enjoy this place.)

2275
01:17:45,986 --> 01:17:47,015
(Singing)

2276
01:17:47,016 --> 01:17:48,786
(Singing)

2277
01:17:49,386 --> 01:17:52,016
(Let's sing together.)

2278
01:17:52,086 --> 01:17:53,155
Moo for us!

2279
01:17:53,156 --> 01:17:54,825
(Let's end with a moo.)

2280
01:17:54,826 --> 01:17:56,825
- You told me not to do it earlier!
- Gosh.

2281
01:17:56,826 --> 01:17:58,656
He told me not to do it as it took so long.

2282
01:17:59,166 --> 01:18:00,926
He said that he'd get home late because of the mooing.

2283
01:18:02,266 --> 01:18:03,896
He told me not to do it, viewers.

2284
01:18:04,166 --> 01:18:05,605
(Here's "Moon Se Yoon Show" instead of the mooing.)

2285
01:18:05,606 --> 01:18:06,766
The star of Pyeongchang-dong.

2286
01:18:08,136 --> 01:18:11,576
(Let's enjoy it together.)

2287
01:18:11,836 --> 01:18:13,575
(Se Yoon has come)

2288
01:18:13,576 --> 01:18:15,446
(To Handsome Guys)

2289
01:18:15,846 --> 01:18:17,515
(Se Yoon has come)

2290
01:18:17,516 --> 01:18:19,315
(To Handsome Guys to eat)

2291
01:18:19,316 --> 01:18:21,145
(The table)

2292
01:18:21,146 --> 01:18:23,356
(Was full of food)

2293
01:18:24,016 --> 01:18:26,526
(It tasted amazing)

2294
01:18:27,056 --> 01:18:30,055
(The lyrics are very honest.)

2295
01:18:30,056 --> 01:18:31,926
(Part 2 starts right away.)

2296
01:18:31,956 --> 01:18:35,536
(Dong Hyun has come to Handsome Guys too)

2297
01:18:35,666 --> 01:18:38,766
(He mesmerizes the guests by calling out their names.)

2298
01:18:39,336 --> 01:18:41,666
(Sang Uk, Seung Ho...)

2299
01:18:41,966 --> 01:18:45,945
(and Yi Kyung get mentioned too.)

2300
01:18:45,946 --> 01:18:46,976
Thank you, everyone.

2301
01:18:47,006 --> 01:18:48,545
(The best performance in 2025)

2302
01:18:48,546 --> 01:18:51,646
- Enjoy the food here.
- Do it one last time for us.

2303
01:18:51,946 --> 01:18:54,846
(A congratulatory moo for a successful performance)

2304
01:18:55,286 --> 01:18:56,655
("Moon Se Yoon Show" is over.)

2305
01:18:56,656 --> 01:18:58,255
We're using the things around us so well.

2306
01:18:58,256 --> 01:18:59,256
That was amazing.

2307
01:19:01,986 --> 01:19:03,255
- The food is here.
- The timing was spot on.

2308
01:19:03,256 --> 01:19:04,256
(The food gets served right after the performance.)

2309
01:19:04,257 --> 01:19:06,726
- What are those?
- There are whelks.

2310
01:19:07,496 --> 01:19:09,466
The food is served like this.

2311
01:19:09,696 --> 01:19:10,935
- There are whelks.
- What is all this?

2312
01:19:10,936 --> 01:19:12,205
- There are whelks.
- Whelks?

2313
01:19:12,206 --> 01:19:13,206
(The appetizers get served first.)

2314
01:19:13,207 --> 01:19:16,506
(There's more.)

2315
01:19:16,636 --> 01:19:19,076
- It's served so nicely.
- These are great with drinks.

2316
01:19:19,176 --> 01:19:20,246
They are side dishes for drinks.

2317
01:19:22,176 --> 01:19:25,516
(The cucumber salad with a special treasure hidden)

2318
01:19:26,546 --> 01:19:30,686
(Whelks that are as big as fists)

2319
01:19:31,716 --> 01:19:34,085
(Salted sea pineapple and pollack roe...)

2320
01:19:34,086 --> 01:19:36,056
(with a deep scent of the sea)

2321
01:19:36,996 --> 01:19:38,595
Have the pollack roe with the cucumber.

2322
01:19:38,596 --> 01:19:39,925
Have them together.

2323
01:19:39,926 --> 01:19:40,966
I'll try this first.

2324
01:19:41,126 --> 01:19:43,336
Since there are people who don't like salted sea pineapples...

2325
01:19:43,536 --> 01:19:44,835
This is really good.

2326
01:19:44,836 --> 01:19:46,566
Hold on. What's that underneath?

2327
01:19:46,736 --> 01:19:48,735
- There are cabbage slices.
- There are mushrooms too.

2328
01:19:48,736 --> 01:19:49,775
Is that squid?

2329
01:19:49,776 --> 01:19:51,675
There are mushrooms. Shiitake mushrooms.

2330
01:19:51,676 --> 01:19:54,805
(There are shiitake mushrooms hidden beneath the cucumbers...)

2331
01:19:54,806 --> 01:19:59,415
(along with cabbage slices.)

2332
01:19:59,416 --> 01:20:01,215
I'm so curious about this one.

2333
01:20:01,216 --> 01:20:02,956
Cucumbers and shiitake mushrooms...

2334
01:20:03,456 --> 01:20:05,385
have a scent that spreads out.

2335
01:20:05,386 --> 01:20:06,786
It completely spreads inside your mouth.

2336
01:20:07,786 --> 01:20:08,786
(Sniffing)

2337
01:20:09,096 --> 01:20:10,255
(He takes a careful bite...)

2338
01:20:10,256 --> 01:20:12,626
(of the unfamiliar combination.)

2339
01:20:13,596 --> 01:20:15,636
- This is a true delicacy.
- Gosh.

2340
01:20:16,036 --> 01:20:18,866
The soft texture and scent of the mushroom is really nice.

2341
01:20:19,906 --> 01:20:21,466
I should try this.

2342
01:20:21,606 --> 01:20:22,675
I'm not sure if it will be salty.

2343
01:20:22,676 --> 01:20:24,136
I'm so curious about the salted sea pineapple.

2344
01:20:24,436 --> 01:20:26,675
I'll try it like this first.

2345
01:20:26,676 --> 01:20:30,516
(Yi Kyung's combination: Cucumber, tofu, salted sea pineapple)

2346
01:20:31,076 --> 01:20:32,116
It isn't salty.

2347
01:20:33,146 --> 01:20:36,386
(Dong Hyun goes with the tofu and salted sea pineapple.)

2348
01:20:36,886 --> 01:20:39,586
(Satisfied)

2349
01:20:39,956 --> 01:20:42,856
- What is that?
- The scent of sea feels so nice.

2350
01:20:43,726 --> 01:20:46,526
(Tae Hyun gets the cucumber and salted pollack roe.)

2351
01:20:46,696 --> 01:20:47,796
It should be eaten like this.

2352
01:20:47,996 --> 01:20:49,295
That's a great combination.

2353
01:20:49,296 --> 01:20:50,896
(Expecting to be satisfied even before trying it)

2354
01:20:51,096 --> 01:20:52,665
The salted pollack roe isn't that salty.

2355
01:20:52,666 --> 01:20:55,066
- It isn't salty.
- Gosh!

2356
01:20:55,336 --> 01:20:56,336
That's good.

2357
01:20:56,676 --> 01:20:59,706
The cucumber can express...

2358
01:21:00,776 --> 01:21:02,416
this many tastes.

2359
01:21:03,576 --> 01:21:05,375
A totally new combination was served by him.

2360
01:21:05,376 --> 01:21:08,486
This is totally my style.

2361
01:21:08,716 --> 01:21:09,856
It's a great appetizer.

2362
01:21:10,286 --> 01:21:11,355
The whelk.

2363
01:21:11,356 --> 01:21:13,656
(They go for the whelks this time.)

2364
01:21:13,756 --> 01:21:15,656
- This has to be removed.
- Right.

2365
01:21:15,896 --> 01:21:18,525
- This is held with one hand.
- Pick it out.

2366
01:21:18,526 --> 01:21:19,526
Gosh.

2367
01:21:19,796 --> 01:21:21,996
Is this part eaten? Shouldn't this be removed?

2368
01:21:22,166 --> 01:21:24,595
- It's based on preference.
- It's based on preference.

2369
01:21:24,596 --> 01:21:27,066
I should remove it.

2370
01:21:27,806 --> 01:21:29,135
I'll just try it without anything else.

2371
01:21:29,136 --> 01:21:34,076
(He tries the first bite with its original taste.)

2372
01:21:36,946 --> 01:21:39,045
It feels like you're by the beach as soon as you take a bite.

2373
01:21:39,046 --> 01:21:40,115
(It feels like you're by the beach as soon as you take a bite!)

2374
01:21:40,116 --> 01:21:41,146
I'm serious!

2375
01:21:41,716 --> 01:21:42,785
He will say the same thing.

2376
01:21:42,786 --> 01:21:44,856
(Agreeing)

2377
01:21:45,056 --> 01:21:46,785
It was just blanched, right?

2378
01:21:46,786 --> 01:21:48,355
It doesn't feel seasoned, right?

2379
01:21:48,356 --> 01:21:50,326
I think it was seasoned slightly.

2380
01:21:50,726 --> 01:21:52,425
- It tastes a bit different.
- Is that so?

2381
01:21:52,426 --> 01:21:53,795
It does feel like he did something.

2382
01:21:53,796 --> 01:21:56,396
(The whelks were seasoned.)

2383
01:21:57,036 --> 01:22:04,176
(They were drenched with the owner's special sauce.)

2384
01:22:05,336 --> 01:22:06,345
(The main dishes now get served after the appetizers!)

2385
01:22:06,346 --> 01:22:07,405
- It's here.
- What is it?

2386
01:22:07,406 --> 01:22:08,476
It's raw fish.

2387
01:22:08,876 --> 01:22:09,915
- Pass it down.
- Is it sea bream?

2388
01:22:09,916 --> 01:22:11,575
That's right. This dish was an appetizer.

2389
01:22:11,576 --> 01:22:14,016
You guys are done with the dish already.

2390
01:22:14,146 --> 01:22:15,716
- It was so tasty.
- There's more than enough.

2391
01:22:16,986 --> 01:22:18,155
- It's the sea bream skin.
- What's this?

2392
01:22:18,156 --> 01:22:19,225
- What is it?
- This is...

2393
01:22:19,226 --> 01:22:20,286
The sea bream skin.

2394
01:22:20,586 --> 01:22:22,356
It's raw brown croaker that's cost-effective these days.

2395
01:22:22,456 --> 01:22:23,496
- Brown croaker.
- Brown croaker.

2396
01:22:23,926 --> 01:22:24,926
It's brown croaker.

2397
01:22:24,927 --> 01:22:26,065
(Raw brown croaker is cost-effective these days...)

2398
01:22:26,066 --> 01:22:27,296
(since it's right before its season.)

2399
01:22:27,666 --> 01:22:28,695
- Skin.
- Skin.

2400
01:22:28,696 --> 01:22:30,066
- Belly. Swim bladder.
- Swim bladder.

2401
01:22:30,296 --> 01:22:31,735
- Is it a swim bladder?
- Brown croaker's swim bladder.

2402
01:22:31,736 --> 01:22:32,806
(Swim bladder, belly, and skin)

2403
01:22:33,066 --> 01:22:35,065
- Can you eat raw swim bladder?
- It's precious.

2404
01:22:35,066 --> 01:22:36,106
How about this one?

2405
01:22:36,276 --> 01:22:38,236
- It's an eel.
- Eel.

2406
01:22:38,476 --> 01:22:39,605
- Eel?
- Eel.

2407
01:22:39,606 --> 01:22:40,945
- Conger eel.
- Conger eel.

2408
01:22:40,946 --> 01:22:42,475
- It's my absolute favorite.
- Conger eel.

2409
01:22:42,476 --> 01:22:43,546
It's raw.

2410
01:22:44,646 --> 01:22:46,146
- Eel.
- Sir, what should we eat first?

2411
01:22:46,516 --> 01:22:47,985
- Shall we eat brown croaker first?
- Any one of them?

2412
01:22:47,986 --> 01:22:49,486
- Eat the swim bladder 1st.
- Let's eat the swim bladder 1st.

2413
01:22:50,016 --> 01:22:51,155
- This...
- Eat it as it is.

2414
01:22:51,156 --> 01:22:52,726
- As it is?
- It doesn't need a sauce.

2415
01:22:53,286 --> 01:22:55,996
(He eats the swim bladder first as the owner suggested.)

2416
01:22:56,256 --> 01:22:57,525
How is it only 50 dollars per person...

2417
01:22:57,526 --> 01:22:58,856
when the course contains a brown croaker?

2418
01:22:58,996 --> 01:23:00,566
It's my first time seeing a brown croaker's swim bladder.

2419
01:23:00,726 --> 01:23:02,195
- How does it taste?
- Hey, it's so tasty.

2420
01:23:02,196 --> 01:23:03,235
- Is it chewy?
- Try it.

2421
01:23:03,236 --> 01:23:04,566
(Dong Hyun, it's so tasty. Try it.)

2422
01:23:05,036 --> 01:23:06,866
(He takes a bite carefully.)

2423
01:23:07,066 --> 01:23:09,305
(Oh, my!)

2424
01:23:09,306 --> 01:23:10,876
Isn't it tasty? It's so fascinating.

2425
01:23:11,176 --> 01:23:13,545
- That's so mean.
- Why is it so chewy at the end?

2426
01:23:13,546 --> 01:23:14,576
Seriously.

2427
01:23:15,106 --> 01:23:16,976
There's something like digestive fluid inside.

2428
01:23:18,116 --> 01:23:19,785
Fluid comes out.

2429
01:23:19,786 --> 01:23:21,285
- It's chewy.
- The initial taste is so...

2430
01:23:21,286 --> 01:23:23,716
A brown croaker's swim bladder is as chewy as gum.

2431
01:23:24,056 --> 01:23:25,415
It's fascinating.

2432
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:27,456
- I love this texture.
- It melts in your mouth.

2433
01:23:27,826 --> 01:23:30,425
- It's so fascinating.
- I love that this texture...

2434
01:23:30,426 --> 01:23:33,296
is coming from food, not gum.

2435
01:23:34,596 --> 01:23:36,466
(He eats a piece of the brown croaker flesh.)

2436
01:23:37,466 --> 01:23:39,435
- It's a brown croaker!
- Is this it?

2437
01:23:39,436 --> 01:23:41,266
(The brown croaker flesh is insane as well.)

2438
01:23:42,266 --> 01:23:43,905
(Thickly-sliced brown croaker flesh...)

2439
01:23:43,906 --> 01:23:46,676
(has the softest texture.)

2440
01:23:47,406 --> 01:23:49,275
Shall we order a glass of alcohol?

2441
01:23:49,276 --> 01:23:51,315
Go ahead. Order a glass.

2442
01:23:51,316 --> 01:23:53,346
How about a glass of highball? You guys won't drink it, right?

2443
01:23:54,246 --> 01:23:56,155
I can drink up to three glasses of highball.

2444
01:23:56,156 --> 01:23:57,456
Is there raspberry highball?

2445
01:23:58,386 --> 01:23:59,485
- Come on.
- It's up to the owner.

2446
01:23:59,486 --> 01:24:00,486
This restaurant isn't like that.

2447
01:24:00,487 --> 01:24:01,926
- Then please give me anything.
- Seriously.

2448
01:24:02,026 --> 01:24:04,255
Don't make yourself stand out, okay?

2449
01:24:04,256 --> 01:24:06,026
(I'll get you something nice.)

2450
01:24:06,426 --> 01:24:08,395
Conger eel is so tasty.

2451
01:24:08,396 --> 01:24:09,865
You're familiar with conger eels if you're from Busan.

2452
01:24:09,866 --> 01:24:10,866
That's right.

2453
01:24:12,706 --> 01:24:14,665
How does he cook it like this? How fascinating.

2454
01:24:14,666 --> 01:24:16,676
(How does he cook it like this?)

2455
01:24:16,906 --> 01:24:18,475
(Serious, confused, happy)

2456
01:24:18,476 --> 01:24:19,506
What's this?

2457
01:24:20,776 --> 01:24:21,875
(Why is everything tasty?)

2458
01:24:21,876 --> 01:24:22,946
If you're from Busan...

2459
01:24:24,516 --> 01:24:25,516
You know,

2460
01:24:26,146 --> 01:24:28,986
- this... Was it called shichimi?
- Yes.

2461
01:24:29,046 --> 01:24:32,185
Shichimi and green onion create an incredible combination.

2462
01:24:32,186 --> 01:24:33,655
(Shichimi's spiciness and crispness and sharpness of green onion)

2463
01:24:33,656 --> 01:24:35,025
It's like a seasoned dish.

2464
01:24:35,026 --> 01:24:36,555
(The harmony of the tastes...)

2465
01:24:36,556 --> 01:24:38,156
(makes it seem like seasoned raw fish.)

2466
01:24:38,556 --> 01:24:39,725
It's so unique.

2467
01:24:39,726 --> 01:24:42,536
- Among what we've eaten so far, - It smells so good.

2468
01:24:42,666 --> 01:24:45,035
it has the taste I've never had before.

2469
01:24:45,036 --> 01:24:46,865
(Let's smell it at the very least.)

2470
01:24:46,866 --> 01:24:48,435
It smells like green onions.

2471
01:24:48,436 --> 01:24:49,805
(Let me get a sniff.)

2472
01:24:49,806 --> 01:24:50,906
- It smells like green onions.
- What's this?

2473
01:24:51,306 --> 01:24:53,645
(Let me get a sniff as well.)

2474
01:24:53,646 --> 01:24:54,705
Shall we have a quiz for this dish?

2475
01:24:54,706 --> 01:24:56,315
- We gave many questions earlier.
- Hey,

2476
01:24:56,316 --> 01:24:58,475
- this is worth a quiz.
- It's the Japanese style.

2477
01:24:58,476 --> 01:24:59,746
This is worth a quiz.

2478
01:25:00,016 --> 01:25:01,386
- A question.
- Se Yoon, do you want to eat?

2479
01:25:02,816 --> 01:25:04,015
- I want to eat.
- I picked a number...

2480
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:06,526
between 1 and 10.

2481
01:25:06,826 --> 01:25:08,255
- Which number is it?
- Okay.

2482
01:25:08,256 --> 01:25:10,826
- All right.
- I know exactly what it is.

2483
01:25:11,396 --> 01:25:12,795
It's six. Do you know why?

2484
01:25:12,796 --> 01:25:13,825
- I thought of six too.
- Why?

2485
01:25:13,826 --> 01:25:16,336
You ranked sixth in the world.

2486
01:25:17,396 --> 01:25:18,635
- It's incorrect.
- What?

2487
01:25:18,636 --> 01:25:20,265
I ranked sixth very briefly.

2488
01:25:20,266 --> 01:25:21,335
- Then I...
- My actual ranking was seven.

2489
01:25:21,336 --> 01:25:23,335
The number I had in mind was seven. I'm sorry.

2490
01:25:23,336 --> 01:25:25,475
The number I had in mind was seven. I'm sorry.

2491
01:25:25,476 --> 01:25:27,105
- I mean...
- Why didn't you give them a chance?

2492
01:25:27,106 --> 01:25:28,745
- Why didn't you guys take a guess?
- Let us answer as well.

2493
01:25:28,746 --> 01:25:30,715
- You guys should do something else.
- I see.

2494
01:25:30,716 --> 01:25:31,716
- Was it seven?
- I almost got angry.

2495
01:25:31,717 --> 01:25:32,746
It was seven.

2496
01:25:32,886 --> 01:25:35,646
There's a color on my mind.

2497
01:25:36,556 --> 01:25:37,616
Which color is it?

2498
01:25:38,316 --> 01:25:40,385
- It's your question.
- Me?

2499
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:41,386
- Really?
- Yes.

2500
01:25:41,387 --> 01:25:42,426
- Me?
- Yes.

2501
01:25:43,496 --> 01:25:44,595
I know.

2502
01:25:44,596 --> 01:25:46,166
(He suddenly becomes torn.)

2503
01:25:46,466 --> 01:25:49,195
There's a color you like superstitiously.

2504
01:25:49,196 --> 01:25:51,096
(Hint: It's a color Dong Hyun likes superstitiously.)

2505
01:25:51,696 --> 01:25:52,736
- Which one is it?
- All right.

2506
01:25:53,206 --> 01:25:54,266
Red.

2507
01:25:54,936 --> 01:25:56,006
- Red.
- Let me answer.

2508
01:25:56,236 --> 01:25:57,236
Correct.

2509
01:25:57,806 --> 01:25:59,375
Red is correct.

2510
01:25:59,376 --> 01:26:01,076
It's time for my question.

2511
01:26:01,676 --> 01:26:03,745
I'll eat a piece then.

2512
01:26:03,746 --> 01:26:05,216
- Eat a piece.
- Take any piece you like.

2513
01:26:05,446 --> 01:26:06,616
Eat it as it is.

2514
01:26:13,586 --> 01:26:14,625
It's tasty, right?

2515
01:26:14,626 --> 01:26:16,656
- The raw fish is sweet. Seriously.
- Right?

2516
01:26:17,796 --> 01:26:20,065
Shichimi and green onion...

2517
01:26:20,066 --> 01:26:21,426
- Isn't the combination perfect?
- It's perfect.

2518
01:26:21,566 --> 01:26:22,636
They're like seasoning.

2519
01:26:22,766 --> 01:26:25,035
The raw fish is sweet, but shichimi and green onion...

2520
01:26:25,036 --> 01:26:26,836
(Only those who have tried it know the unique collaboration.)

2521
01:26:28,406 --> 01:26:29,330
This one isn't sweet.

2522
01:26:29,506 --> 01:26:30,575
(They receive the drinks.)

2523
01:26:30,576 --> 01:26:31,606
Highball.

2524
01:26:32,006 --> 01:26:34,076
- Thanks for your hard work today.
- Thanks.

2525
01:26:34,606 --> 01:26:35,645
This is legit.

2526
01:26:35,646 --> 01:26:36,846
(Thanks for your hard work today.)

2527
01:26:38,046 --> 01:26:39,516
- It's strong.
- It's nice.

2528
01:26:39,546 --> 01:26:40,646
- It's so nice.
- It's tasty.

2529
01:26:40,786 --> 01:26:42,786
He didn't skimp on the whiskey.

2530
01:26:43,386 --> 01:26:45,615
- Most restaurants do that.
- It's rich.

2531
01:26:45,616 --> 01:26:47,225
- He didn't skimp on it at all.
- It's so nice.

2532
01:26:47,226 --> 01:26:48,255
Really?

2533
01:26:48,256 --> 01:26:50,295
Let's give Seung Ho a question. Three pieces remain.

2534
01:26:50,296 --> 01:26:51,396
- Seung Ho?
- Yes.

2535
01:26:51,696 --> 01:26:54,566
What does my dad say first...

2536
01:26:54,766 --> 01:26:57,135
when he comes home from work?

2537
01:26:57,136 --> 01:26:58,436
(What does Yi Kyung's dad say first when he comes home from work?)

2538
01:26:58,836 --> 01:27:00,065
- Let me answer.
- Go ahead.

2539
01:27:00,066 --> 01:27:01,235
Gosh, darn it!

2540
01:27:01,236 --> 01:27:04,675
(Answer: Gosh, darn it!)

2541
01:27:04,676 --> 01:27:06,405
- You're talking about my dad!
- Is it incorrect?

2542
01:27:06,406 --> 01:27:08,776
- You're talking about my dad!
- His work is too exhausting.

2543
01:27:09,516 --> 01:27:11,016
- Let me answer. I know.
- Go ahead.

2544
01:27:11,446 --> 01:27:12,746
What's your dad's name?

2545
01:27:12,846 --> 01:27:14,346
It's Lee Ung Beom.

2546
01:27:14,546 --> 01:27:15,846
The cute Ung Beom is here!

2547
01:27:16,816 --> 01:27:19,015
- Are you serious?
- I'm sorry.

2548
01:27:19,016 --> 01:27:20,225
Fine. Go ahead and eat.

2549
01:27:20,226 --> 01:27:21,455
- Thank you.
- He knows how to act cute.

2550
01:27:21,456 --> 01:27:22,856
Dad, please do it.

2551
01:27:23,056 --> 01:27:24,696
The cute Ung Beom is here!

2552
01:27:25,626 --> 01:27:28,096
- I love you, sir.
- I guess he's very cute.

2553
01:27:28,226 --> 01:27:30,335
I pray you'll always be healthy.

2554
01:27:30,336 --> 01:27:31,935
- Thank you.
- Dad, please do it.

2555
01:27:31,936 --> 01:27:32,966
I'll go home to hear it.

2556
01:27:33,666 --> 01:27:35,565
- He knows how to act cute.
- Dad will be happy.

2557
01:27:35,566 --> 01:27:37,006
(He takes a bite while feeling guilty.)

2558
01:27:37,806 --> 01:27:41,076
(Sir, thank you.)

2559
01:27:41,406 --> 01:27:43,976
Tae Hyun, please stop laughing and give me a question.

2560
01:27:44,146 --> 01:27:45,146
Gosh, I...

2561
01:27:45,816 --> 01:27:47,586
What's Tae Hyun's favorite song?

2562
01:27:47,686 --> 01:27:49,345
Tae Hyun, think of your favorite song.

2563
01:27:49,346 --> 01:27:50,516
(Yi Kyung gives a question instead of Tae Hyun.)

2564
01:27:50,616 --> 01:27:52,285
- Tae Hyun's?
- "The Two-Lane Bridge."

2565
01:27:52,286 --> 01:27:53,785
("The Two-Lane Bridge")

2566
01:27:53,786 --> 01:27:55,925
- Is his favorite song his own?
- It won't be easy.

2567
01:27:55,926 --> 01:27:57,126
Isn't that a bit small-minded?

2568
01:27:57,396 --> 01:27:58,396
By any chance...

2569
01:27:58,397 --> 01:28:01,125
("The Two-Lane Bridge" by Cha Tae Hyun)

2570
01:28:01,126 --> 01:28:03,865
(The last farewell on the two-lane bridge)

2571
01:28:03,866 --> 01:28:05,236
Will it be number one or not?

2572
01:28:05,496 --> 01:28:07,205
("I Love You" by Cha Tae Hyun)

2573
01:28:07,206 --> 01:28:09,506
(I regret my love I trusted you like a fool)

2574
01:28:09,736 --> 01:28:12,176
"I Love You" or "The Two-Lane Bridge."

2575
01:28:12,776 --> 01:28:15,546
"I Love You" or "The Two-Lane Bridge."

2576
01:28:16,176 --> 01:28:18,446
Okay. That must be it. "The Two-Lane Bridge."

2577
01:28:18,646 --> 01:28:19,715
It's "I Love You!"

2578
01:28:19,716 --> 01:28:21,086
(Incorrect)

2579
01:28:21,816 --> 01:28:23,685
(I can't believe it.)

2580
01:28:23,686 --> 01:28:25,886
I was so close.

2581
01:28:27,286 --> 01:28:29,285
(Se Yoon blows his last chance.)

2582
01:28:29,286 --> 01:28:30,796
How fascinating.

2583
01:28:33,126 --> 01:28:36,066
(He steals Dong Hyun's cup in the most natural way.)

2584
01:28:36,496 --> 01:28:37,496
(Oh, my)

2585
01:28:37,936 --> 01:28:39,365
- What's this?
- What?

2586
01:28:39,366 --> 01:28:40,366
Hold on a second!

2587
01:28:40,936 --> 01:28:41,966
Just now...

2588
01:28:42,306 --> 01:28:43,736
Why did you put it in front of me?

2589
01:28:44,136 --> 01:28:45,176
Just now...

2590
01:28:45,476 --> 01:28:46,806
- As if...
- I thought it was water!

2591
01:28:47,576 --> 01:28:49,376
- As if he were drinking water...
- It was alcohol.

2592
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:51,176
Just now...

2593
01:28:51,177 --> 01:28:52,575
(Coughing and retching)

2594
01:28:52,576 --> 01:28:53,615
It was alcohol.

2595
01:28:53,616 --> 01:28:55,486
(Gosh, I'm dying.)

2596
01:28:55,986 --> 01:28:57,585
(He's incredulous because his drink is gone.)

2597
01:28:57,586 --> 01:28:58,686
It was alcohol.

2598
01:28:58,956 --> 01:29:00,655
(It's empty.)

2599
01:29:00,656 --> 01:29:02,085
I told you not to put it in front of me! Unbelievable!

2600
01:29:02,086 --> 01:29:04,596
- He finished it.
- What's wrong with you?

2601
01:29:04,996 --> 01:29:06,025
He finished it.

2602
01:29:06,026 --> 01:29:07,396
- Hurry up and apologize.
- For goodness' sake.

2603
01:29:07,596 --> 01:29:08,625
I'm sorry.

2604
01:29:08,626 --> 01:29:09,895
(He even apologizes.)

2605
01:29:09,896 --> 01:29:11,336
- Hurry up.
- I'm sorry.

2606
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,505
(The next dishes appear.)

2607
01:29:13,506 --> 01:29:14,536
More dishes are coming.

2608
01:29:15,206 --> 01:29:16,236
What are those?

2609
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:19,906
- It's a cuttlefish dish.
- What is this?

2610
01:29:20,576 --> 01:29:21,946
How... What is this?

2611
01:29:22,646 --> 01:29:25,275
(The other team is curious as well.)

2612
01:29:25,276 --> 01:29:26,515
- Cuttlefish.
- How about this one?

2613
01:29:26,516 --> 01:29:27,585
(Cuttlefish)

2614
01:29:27,586 --> 01:29:29,216
It's a wild-caught tiger puffer.

2615
01:29:29,446 --> 01:29:30,685
- Tiger puffer?
- Tiger puffer?

2616
01:29:30,686 --> 01:29:31,786
Is it a tiger puffer dish?

2617
01:29:34,286 --> 01:29:38,626
(The luxurious seafood dish, raw wild-caught tiger puffer)

2618
01:29:39,296 --> 01:29:43,136
(The dish with the best texture, poached cuttlefish)

2619
01:29:44,196 --> 01:29:46,095
How is it 50 dollars per person?

2620
01:29:46,096 --> 01:29:47,666
The price of 50 dollars makes no sense.

2621
01:29:48,766 --> 01:29:51,806
- That's right. So...
- It doesn't have poison, right?

2622
01:29:52,276 --> 01:29:53,746
One of the six pieces has it.

2623
01:29:54,576 --> 01:29:55,775
(He's ridiculous.)

2624
01:29:55,776 --> 01:29:56,845
It's the Russian tiger puffer.

2625
01:29:56,846 --> 01:29:58,415
- The Russian tiger puffer.
- A Russian roulette.

2626
01:29:58,416 --> 01:29:59,445
The Russian tiger puffer.

2627
01:29:59,446 --> 01:30:00,586
The Russian tiger puffer.

2628
01:30:00,916 --> 01:30:02,045
Let's play rock-paper-scissors...

2629
01:30:02,046 --> 01:30:03,115
for a shot of tetrodotoxin.

2630
01:30:03,116 --> 01:30:05,286
I know that it's your scheme to eat!

2631
01:30:05,416 --> 01:30:07,026
One of the six pieces has it.

2632
01:30:07,426 --> 01:30:08,455
(There is no poison.)

2633
01:30:08,456 --> 01:30:10,626
(He has a license to cook pufferfish.)

2634
01:30:10,956 --> 01:30:12,255
(Instead of playing the Russian tiger puffer,)

2635
01:30:12,256 --> 01:30:14,866
(Tae Hyun tries the cuttlefish dish.)

2636
01:30:16,396 --> 01:30:17,995
- I really want to try it.
- What?

2637
01:30:17,996 --> 01:30:19,236
Why is it spicy?

2638
01:30:19,496 --> 01:30:21,106
- It's spicy.
- It's spicy.

2639
01:30:21,736 --> 01:30:23,375
What's the sauce on the outside?

2640
01:30:23,376 --> 01:30:25,135
Why is it numbing?

2641
01:30:25,136 --> 01:30:27,475
- Isn't it capsaicin?
- Is it numbing?

2642
01:30:27,476 --> 01:30:29,145
- I mean...
- Tabasco.

2643
01:30:29,146 --> 01:30:31,246
- It's Tabasco.
- Is it sour?

2644
01:30:31,516 --> 01:30:32,675
It's tasty.

2645
01:30:32,676 --> 01:30:35,045
(Is the hot sauce sprinkled on the top?)

2646
01:30:35,046 --> 01:30:36,115
- Dong Hyun.
- Yes?

2647
01:30:36,116 --> 01:30:37,155
(Dong Hyun!)

2648
01:30:37,156 --> 01:30:38,156
What is it?

2649
01:30:38,157 --> 01:30:40,585
If the combination isn't soy sauce and Tabasco...

2650
01:30:40,586 --> 01:30:41,626
Okay.

2651
01:30:41,926 --> 01:30:43,325
Can you stop eating?

2652
01:30:43,326 --> 01:30:44,426
For goodness' sake.

2653
01:30:45,126 --> 01:30:47,695
I have a very delicate sense of smell.

2654
01:30:47,696 --> 01:30:48,795
That's why I'm suggesting this.

2655
01:30:48,796 --> 01:30:50,335
- Isn't it Tabasco?
- If it isn't Tabasco...

2656
01:30:50,336 --> 01:30:51,766
You should bet something as well.

2657
01:30:52,296 --> 01:30:53,965
If it's Tabasco...

2658
01:30:53,966 --> 01:30:56,705
(If it's the hot sauce)

2659
01:30:56,706 --> 01:30:58,235
Will you take my place?

2660
01:30:58,236 --> 01:31:00,805
(If it's the hot sauce, will you take my place?)

2661
01:31:00,806 --> 01:31:02,006
- What are you talking about?
- What are you talking about?

2662
01:31:02,106 --> 01:31:03,215
- There he goes again.
- You should pay then.

2663
01:31:03,216 --> 01:31:04,216
- What?
- You should pay then.

2664
01:31:04,217 --> 01:31:05,415
(What's wrong with him?)

2665
01:31:05,416 --> 01:31:07,045
- What?
- If it's Tabasco,

2666
01:31:07,046 --> 01:31:08,415
- you'll be correct.
- Is that so?

2667
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,685
- What?
- I'm sorry.

2668
01:31:09,686 --> 01:31:10,855
- Is it good for me?
- If it isn't Tabasco,

2669
01:31:10,856 --> 01:31:12,655
- you should pay.
- Does he want to switch places?

2670
01:31:12,656 --> 01:31:13,686
- I'm sorry.
- Dong Hyun.

2671
01:31:13,786 --> 01:31:15,226
Don't make it complicated.

2672
01:31:16,186 --> 01:31:17,956
If it isn't Tabasco,

2673
01:31:18,326 --> 01:31:19,796
we'll switch places.

2674
01:31:20,126 --> 01:31:21,625
- If it's Tabasco, - Okay.

2675
01:31:21,626 --> 01:31:23,935
I'll participate in the Russian tiger puffer.

2676
01:31:23,936 --> 01:31:25,295
(He'll eat no matter what.)

2677
01:31:25,296 --> 01:31:26,766
(He'll participate in the Russian tiger puffer.)

2678
01:31:27,306 --> 01:31:30,735
(One of the six pieces will be his.)

2679
01:31:30,736 --> 01:31:32,675
I'll take up on his offer.

2680
01:31:32,676 --> 01:31:34,246
- If he's correct...
- Okay.

2681
01:31:34,476 --> 01:31:37,645
If it isn't Tabasco, I'll switch places...

2682
01:31:37,646 --> 01:31:38,815
- With Se Yoon.
- with Se Yoon.

2683
01:31:38,816 --> 01:31:40,245
- What if it's Tabasco?
- What if it's Tabasco?

2684
01:31:40,246 --> 01:31:42,145
You'll take a low kick from me.

2685
01:31:42,146 --> 01:31:44,615
(If it's the hot sauce, he'll take a low kick.)

2686
01:31:44,616 --> 01:31:45,986
Will you sacrifice one leg?

2687
01:31:46,116 --> 01:31:47,186
Oh, my, Dong Hyun.

2688
01:31:48,756 --> 01:31:50,095
It's quite a strong proposal.

2689
01:31:50,096 --> 01:31:52,296
(It's quite a strong proposal.)

2690
01:31:53,526 --> 01:31:54,565
Hold on.

2691
01:31:54,566 --> 01:31:57,896
(Gosh, it'll hurt a lot.)

2692
01:31:58,266 --> 01:32:00,436
I've broken three baseball bats.

2693
01:32:00,836 --> 01:32:02,735
I've broken three baseball bats.

2694
01:32:02,736 --> 01:32:04,005
Is there a possibility that it isn't Tabasco?

2695
01:32:04,006 --> 01:32:05,606
(More careful than ever)

2696
01:32:05,676 --> 01:32:07,545
My thighs are still strong.

2697
01:32:07,546 --> 01:32:09,846
- Dong Hyun, are you left-footed?
- It has to be Tabasco.

2698
01:32:10,576 --> 01:32:12,476
You can see my thigh muscles, right?

2699
01:32:13,616 --> 01:32:14,885
I accept your proposal.

2700
01:32:14,886 --> 01:32:15,986
- Okay.
- Okay.

2701
01:32:16,016 --> 01:32:17,455
I shouldn't kick gently.

2702
01:32:17,456 --> 01:32:18,555
- He's here.
- It's a game.

2703
01:32:18,556 --> 01:32:19,585
(The man who will seal their fate enters.)

2704
01:32:19,586 --> 01:32:21,125
- Sir.
- Thank you.

2705
01:32:21,126 --> 01:32:22,386
- We have a question.
- Yes.

2706
01:32:23,296 --> 01:32:26,866
Please answer my question.

2707
01:32:26,996 --> 01:32:28,696
Does the cuttlefish dish contain...

2708
01:32:28,966 --> 01:32:32,696
Tabasco or not?

2709
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:36,905
Does it contain Tabasco or not?

2710
01:32:36,906 --> 01:32:38,776
- What will be the answer?
- It's spicy.

2711
01:32:40,106 --> 01:32:41,275
It contains it.

2712
01:32:41,276 --> 01:32:44,445
(Dong Hyun wins as it contains the hot sauce.)

2713
01:32:44,446 --> 01:32:46,546
Se Yoon will get a low kick!

2714
01:32:46,646 --> 01:32:48,315
- By any chance...
- Gosh. I'm so frustrated.

2715
01:32:48,316 --> 01:32:51,356
(Gosh. I'm so frustrated.)

2716
01:32:51,686 --> 01:32:53,485
(Acting out before taking a kick)

2717
01:32:53,486 --> 01:32:54,786
Dong Hyun did it again!

2718
01:32:55,626 --> 01:32:57,396
Come on! Sir.

2719
01:32:57,826 --> 01:32:59,425
(My goodness)

2720
01:32:59,426 --> 01:33:01,696
You can't take a kick from him in a sober state.

2721
01:33:01,996 --> 01:33:03,366
Give him your leg, Se Yoon.

2722
01:33:05,066 --> 01:33:06,066
(Patting)

2723
01:33:06,067 --> 01:33:07,265
- Cheer up.
- Okay.

2724
01:33:07,266 --> 01:33:08,566
(Cheer up, young man.)

2725
01:33:08,766 --> 01:33:10,105
(He makes his exit after rooting for him.)

2726
01:33:10,106 --> 01:33:12,036
Do you guys know each other?

2727
01:33:12,236 --> 01:33:13,245
Maybe he's a regular.

2728
01:33:13,246 --> 01:33:15,275
Hold on. Do you guys know each other?

2729
01:33:15,276 --> 01:33:16,815
(I'm drunk on the owner's consideration.)

2730
01:33:16,816 --> 01:33:18,716
You perform here every Saturday, right?

2731
01:33:19,746 --> 01:33:20,915
Be honest.

2732
01:33:20,916 --> 01:33:22,345
You do "Moon Se Yoon Show," right?

2733
01:33:22,346 --> 01:33:23,756
- No.
- It's okay

2734
01:33:23,786 --> 01:33:25,286
That must be it.

2735
01:33:26,086 --> 01:33:27,385
Let's do this.

2736
01:33:27,386 --> 01:33:28,556
Let's hold him.

2737
01:33:29,056 --> 01:33:30,226
He should take it on his hips.

2738
01:33:30,526 --> 01:33:31,955
Wait. Let go of me.

2739
01:33:31,956 --> 01:33:32,956
(It's time to pay the price.)

2740
01:33:32,957 --> 01:33:34,195
Good.

2741
01:33:34,196 --> 01:33:36,295
(I'll make him pay for the stolen drinks as well.)

2742
01:33:36,296 --> 01:33:37,536
You should show it to the cameras.

2743
01:33:37,696 --> 01:33:39,036
I'll do it like this. Yes.

2744
01:33:40,236 --> 01:33:41,536
- He and I...
- What?

2745
01:33:41,866 --> 01:33:44,406
- I can do a calf kick.
- A calf kick.

2746
01:33:44,776 --> 01:33:45,805
(He's on his fourth demonstrative kick already.)

2747
01:33:45,806 --> 01:33:47,075
- Okay. Let's go.
- Hold on.

2748
01:33:47,076 --> 01:33:48,875
- He kicked Se Yoon many times.
- No.

2749
01:33:48,876 --> 01:33:50,175
- Didn't he kick me?
- No, he didn't.

2750
01:33:50,176 --> 01:33:51,916
- He kicked me many times.
- He didn't kick your hips.

2751
01:33:52,076 --> 01:33:53,345
- Let's begin.
- Here I go.

2752
01:33:53,346 --> 01:33:54,545
- I'll stay still.
- Okay.

2753
01:33:54,546 --> 01:33:56,216
(The demonstration is over. Here we go for real.)

2754
01:33:56,456 --> 01:33:58,116
Tabasco!

2755
01:33:59,256 --> 01:34:01,086
(Kicking)

2756
01:34:04,256 --> 01:34:06,026
(Screaming)

2757
01:34:06,256 --> 01:34:09,226
(He used 10 percent of his strength for the guest's safety.)

2758
01:34:09,496 --> 01:34:11,335
(Hopping)

2759
01:34:11,336 --> 01:34:13,536
Are you dancing?

2760
01:34:13,636 --> 01:34:14,965
- Is it another show?
- Dashing through the snow

2761
01:34:14,966 --> 01:34:16,706
- What's going on?
- In a one horse open sleigh

2762
01:34:16,806 --> 01:34:18,375
- Over the hills we go - Over the hills we go

2763
01:34:18,376 --> 01:34:19,975
- Laughing all the way - Laughing all the way

2764
01:34:19,976 --> 01:34:21,376
(They suddenly have a Christmas party.)

2765
01:34:21,776 --> 01:34:22,875
(Everyone can participate in "Moon Se Yoon Show.")

2766
01:34:22,876 --> 01:34:24,845
- Is it a show?
- That's so funny.

2767
01:34:24,846 --> 01:34:26,616
- My goodness.
- It was too much.

2768
01:34:27,246 --> 01:34:29,085
Is this also a part of "Moon Se Yoon Show?"

2769
01:34:29,086 --> 01:34:30,215
(The professional showman elevated his pain to a party.)

2770
01:34:30,216 --> 01:34:31,656
Everything is "Moon Se Yoon Show."

2771
01:34:32,016 --> 01:34:33,016
Well done.

2772
01:34:33,326 --> 01:34:34,585
- All right.
- It was a light kick.

2773
01:34:34,586 --> 01:34:35,755
It was...

2774
01:34:35,756 --> 01:34:36,956
How was it?

2775
01:34:37,796 --> 01:34:39,925
- It hurt twice.
- Twice.

2776
01:34:39,926 --> 01:34:41,625
- It hurt twice.
- When you take the blow and...

2777
01:34:41,626 --> 01:34:43,231
In "Alien,"

2778
01:34:43,396 --> 01:34:45,095
there's a mouth inside a mouth.

2779
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:46,335
(There's a mouth inside a mouth.)

2780
01:34:46,336 --> 01:34:47,505
When you take the blow,

2781
01:34:47,506 --> 01:34:48,766
there's another push.

2782
01:34:48,906 --> 01:34:50,175
There isn't one impact.

2783
01:34:50,176 --> 01:34:51,905
There isn't one impact like a slap.

2784
01:34:51,906 --> 01:34:53,246
It's like, "Boom, boom!"

2785
01:34:53,406 --> 01:34:54,646
It's like a wind gust.

2786
01:34:55,106 --> 01:34:56,975
- Seriously.
- Like "Fist of the North Star."

2787
01:34:56,976 --> 01:34:58,445
It's like, "Boom, boom!"

2788
01:34:58,446 --> 01:34:59,545
(The class of the man who once placed 6th in the world)

2789
01:34:59,546 --> 01:35:00,715
Shouldn't we play a game for the tiger puffer dish?

2790
01:35:00,716 --> 01:35:01,785
- Hurry up and try it.
- Let's do it.

2791
01:35:01,786 --> 01:35:02,786
Let's play the Russian tiger puffer.

2792
01:35:02,886 --> 01:35:04,455
Shouldn't the six of us play the Russian tiger puffer?

2793
01:35:04,456 --> 01:35:05,755
- Let's take a piece each.
- That's right.

2794
01:35:05,756 --> 01:35:07,586
- I'll take this piece.
- Sliced green onions too.

2795
01:35:08,456 --> 01:35:09,926
How does the tiger puffer taste?

2796
01:35:12,926 --> 01:35:14,095
One piece per person.

2797
01:35:14,096 --> 01:35:16,466
- The back side...
- The texture is insane.

2798
01:35:16,696 --> 01:35:17,895
What's this?

2799
01:35:17,896 --> 01:35:18,936
(What's this?)

2800
01:35:20,336 --> 01:35:22,035
(Oh, my!)

2801
01:35:22,036 --> 01:35:24,076
- It's so chewy.
- This is the tiger puffer.

2802
01:35:24,136 --> 01:35:25,905
Usually, they slice it thin.

2803
01:35:25,906 --> 01:35:27,375
It's my first time eating such a thick slice of pufferfish.

2804
01:35:27,376 --> 01:35:28,446
It's my first time.

2805
01:35:28,906 --> 01:35:30,446
This is incredible.

2806
01:35:31,016 --> 01:35:33,115
(The raw tiger puffer has the smoky aroma...)

2807
01:35:33,116 --> 01:35:35,415
(since the surface is torched.)

2808
01:35:35,416 --> 01:35:36,446
How fascinating.

2809
01:35:36,786 --> 01:35:38,085
It's my first time seeing it.

2810
01:35:38,086 --> 01:35:40,286
(They get another dish.)

2811
01:35:40,426 --> 01:35:42,286
What's this? Why does it look so tasty?

2812
01:35:42,886 --> 01:35:44,226
It's cold pork.

2813
01:35:44,496 --> 01:35:46,025
It's a dish on the menu, cold pork.

2814
01:35:46,026 --> 01:35:48,066
- So that's cold pork.
- Cold pork?

2815
01:35:48,266 --> 01:35:49,426
That's the dish.

2816
01:35:49,496 --> 01:35:51,196
I cooked pork with the sous vide method...

2817
01:35:51,936 --> 01:35:55,366
- Pork.
- under the temperature of 70°C.

2818
01:35:56,066 --> 01:35:57,876
- I see.
- He's good at cooking.

2819
01:35:58,336 --> 01:36:00,405
- It looks like...
- Pork.

2820
01:36:00,406 --> 01:36:01,876
whale meat.

2821
01:36:02,606 --> 01:36:04,515
- That's what it looks like.
- It's due to the fat layer.

2822
01:36:04,516 --> 01:36:06,245
Do you dip it in the sauce?

2823
01:36:06,246 --> 01:36:08,116
(The owner's special seasoning provides a kick!)

2824
01:36:08,716 --> 01:36:11,456
(It's perfect with a slice of chili pepper.)

2825
01:36:11,786 --> 01:36:13,256
- Seriously.
- I'm sure of it.

2826
01:36:13,386 --> 01:36:16,485
People who come here will keep changing the drink...

2827
01:36:16,486 --> 01:36:18,296
- depending on the food.
- This place...

2828
01:36:18,896 --> 01:36:20,295
- The customers will drink a lot.
- I know.

2829
01:36:20,296 --> 01:36:21,466
Gosh, this is...

2830
01:36:22,026 --> 01:36:23,735
The outer layer is the chewy fat.

2831
01:36:23,736 --> 01:36:25,565
- The thick meat is in the middle.
- Yes.

2832
01:36:25,566 --> 01:36:27,265
- It melts in the mouth.
- That's it.

2833
01:36:27,266 --> 01:36:28,305
It melts in the mouth.

2834
01:36:28,306 --> 01:36:30,675
I love how the seasoning cuts down the greasiness.

2835
01:36:30,676 --> 01:36:33,345
It's much more tender than pyeonyuk.

2836
01:36:33,346 --> 01:36:34,646
- That's right.
- It melts in the mouth.

2837
01:36:34,776 --> 01:36:36,615
The chewiness is about 20,000 times...

2838
01:36:36,616 --> 01:36:37,945
than that of pyeonyuk.

2839
01:36:37,946 --> 01:36:38,946
Yes.

2840
01:36:38,947 --> 01:36:40,016
It's chewy.

2841
01:36:41,116 --> 01:36:43,615
Cold pork suddenly became number one.

2842
01:36:43,616 --> 01:36:45,456
- It's number one.
- This is so sudden.

2843
01:36:45,986 --> 01:36:47,286
- It's funny.
- It's number one.

2844
01:36:48,186 --> 01:36:49,385
It's another dish.

2845
01:36:49,386 --> 01:36:51,095
Here comes the grand finale.

2846
01:36:51,096 --> 01:36:52,126
(The final dish will be the grand finale)

2847
01:36:52,256 --> 01:36:55,165
- What?
- That's it. That's what we need.

2848
01:36:55,166 --> 01:36:56,595
A strawberry dessert.

2849
01:36:56,596 --> 01:36:57,895
- There's something on the top.
- Cinnamon.

2850
01:36:57,896 --> 01:36:58,935
Sugar.

2851
01:36:58,936 --> 01:37:00,965
- Cinnamon.
- Cinnamon.

2852
01:37:00,966 --> 01:37:03,336
(Strawberries with cinnamon powder on the top)

2853
01:37:04,106 --> 01:37:05,805
Don't touch it.

2854
01:37:05,806 --> 01:37:07,146
(They eat it quickly to cleanse their palate.)

2855
01:37:07,976 --> 01:37:09,276
It's bound to be tasty.

2856
01:37:09,476 --> 01:37:10,915
Strawberries and cinnamon make the best combination.

2857
01:37:10,916 --> 01:37:13,491
I love the smell of cinnamon.

2858
01:37:13,516 --> 01:37:14,585
- I'm craving it so much.
- I mean...

2859
01:37:14,586 --> 01:37:15,916
It's a taste that improves your mood.

2860
01:37:17,356 --> 01:37:19,715
- How do they go so well together?
- Seriously, what's up...

2861
01:37:19,716 --> 01:37:21,285
with the owner?

2862
01:37:21,286 --> 01:37:22,756
He's like a food researcher.

2863
01:37:23,596 --> 01:37:25,955
How could sugar and cinnamon create such harmony?

2864
01:37:25,956 --> 01:37:28,325
I didn't use sugar.

2865
01:37:28,326 --> 01:37:29,996
- Allulose?
- I used stevia.

2866
01:37:30,296 --> 01:37:32,896
- I see. There's sweetness.
- Stevia.

2867
01:37:33,166 --> 01:37:35,766
Sugar gives a sticky sort of sweetness.

2868
01:37:35,906 --> 01:37:38,536
Stevia gives a fresh sort of sweetness.

2869
01:37:39,249 --> 01:37:41,159
- He's so detailed.
- Yes.

2870
01:37:41,276 --> 01:37:43,515
The way he puts calculations and thoughts behind the recipes...

2871
01:37:43,516 --> 01:37:45,915
- shows his seriousness in cooking.
- This is incredible.

2872
01:37:45,916 --> 01:37:47,345
Make sure you leave behind a piece.

2873
01:37:47,346 --> 01:37:49,585
(Make sure you leave behind a piece.)

2874
01:37:49,586 --> 01:37:50,915
- Let us have a piece each.
- I'm warning you.

2875
01:37:50,916 --> 01:37:51,955
- Leave behind a piece.
- Seriously.

2876
01:37:51,956 --> 01:37:53,216
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

2877
01:37:53,856 --> 01:37:55,355
I'll eat it after they clap the clapperboard.

2878
01:37:55,356 --> 01:37:56,756
(The owner suddenly reaches for the strawberries.)

2879
01:37:56,996 --> 01:38:00,695
(Se Yoon, open wide.)

2880
01:38:00,696 --> 01:38:01,825
My goodness.

2881
01:38:01,826 --> 01:38:03,496
That was sudden.

2882
01:38:04,096 --> 01:38:06,366
(Sir, it's so tasty.)

2883
01:38:06,866 --> 01:38:10,876
(Our friendship turned as sweet as strawberries.)

2884
01:38:11,036 --> 01:38:12,475
(The two of them watch it.)

2885
01:38:12,476 --> 01:38:13,946
Let's try it as well.

2886
01:38:14,276 --> 01:38:15,705
Make sure you leave behind a piece.

2887
01:38:15,706 --> 01:38:16,715
(Sir, can you hear me?)

2888
01:38:16,716 --> 01:38:19,875
- Seriously, leave behind a piece.
- What?

2889
01:38:19,876 --> 01:38:20,946
He's leaving.

2890
01:38:21,146 --> 01:38:22,285
Where are you going?

2891
01:38:22,286 --> 01:38:23,586
(He's gone.)

2892
01:38:23,816 --> 01:38:25,116
Sir, where are you going?

2893
01:38:25,886 --> 01:38:27,055
Sir.

2894
01:38:27,056 --> 01:38:28,425
Hey, leave behind a piece.

2895
01:38:28,426 --> 01:38:29,586
(They call for him, but he disappears.)

2896
01:38:30,226 --> 01:38:32,026
They didn't get a piece. Oh, no.

2897
01:38:32,356 --> 01:38:34,465
- He left.
- I love him so much.

2898
01:38:34,466 --> 01:38:36,166
- He must be very busy.
- He's so funny.

2899
01:38:37,236 --> 01:38:38,536
- Seriously.
- This is...

2900
01:38:39,066 --> 01:38:40,205
(He reappears with a bill.)

2901
01:38:40,206 --> 01:38:41,806
I'm the most curious about this.

2902
01:38:42,036 --> 01:38:43,776
How many dishes can he make?

2903
01:38:44,476 --> 01:38:45,535
(Oh, my!)

2904
01:38:45,536 --> 01:38:46,746
- It's so nice.
- Yes.

2905
01:38:47,246 --> 01:38:48,173
Firstly,

2906
01:38:48,198 --> 01:38:50,515
the omakase is 50 dollars per person.

2907
01:38:50,516 --> 01:38:51,646
Really?

2908
01:38:51,946 --> 01:38:54,085
Although we ate so much,

2909
01:38:54,086 --> 01:38:55,286
the total is 243 dollars.

2910
01:38:55,786 --> 01:38:56,916
Okay.

2911
01:38:57,616 --> 01:38:59,555
He uses high-quality whiskey, but the highball is only 15 dollars.

2912
01:38:59,556 --> 01:39:01,785
Sir, you'll take a loss.

2913
01:39:01,786 --> 01:39:03,725
I just need to make an adequate amount of money.

2914
01:39:03,726 --> 01:39:05,395
(I just need to make an adequate amount of money.)

2915
01:39:05,396 --> 01:39:08,096
Once this episode gets aired...

2916
01:39:08,126 --> 01:39:09,165
I'm worried about that.

2917
01:39:09,166 --> 01:39:11,065
What will you do if customers come from all over the nation?

2918
01:39:11,066 --> 01:39:13,805
People who thought of this place as a hideout...

2919
01:39:13,806 --> 01:39:15,766
- will have a hard time coming.
- It doesn't matter...

2920
01:39:15,966 --> 01:39:17,675
because we take reservations.

2921
01:39:17,676 --> 01:39:18,735
(Don't worry. It's run 100 percent on reservations.)

2922
01:39:18,736 --> 01:39:20,275
Once customers come...

2923
01:39:20,276 --> 01:39:22,975
and communicate with the owner in a fun way,

2924
01:39:22,976 --> 01:39:24,515
- they'll get a hotline...
- That's right.

2925
01:39:24,516 --> 01:39:26,045
- for a reservation.
- That's right.

2926
01:39:26,046 --> 01:39:28,415
I think they'll need to do as much as Se Yoon...

2927
01:39:28,416 --> 01:39:29,986
- That's right.
- to get a hotline.

2928
01:39:30,686 --> 01:39:31,785
It won't be easy.

2929
01:39:31,786 --> 01:39:33,185
I'll come here and have an audition.

2930
01:39:33,186 --> 01:39:34,585
(I'll come here and have an audition.)

2931
01:39:34,586 --> 01:39:36,796
- Sir, thank you.
- Thank you.

2932
01:39:36,856 --> 01:39:38,155
All right. Let's go.

2933
01:39:38,156 --> 01:39:39,996
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

2934
01:39:40,096 --> 01:39:41,152
In the Joseon Dynasty,

2935
01:39:42,396 --> 01:39:44,735
drawings of crabs and fishes...

2936
01:39:44,736 --> 01:39:46,436
called eohaedo were trendy.

2937
01:39:46,666 --> 01:39:49,105
A drawing of fish in particular...

2938
01:39:49,106 --> 01:39:51,876
represented passing the state exam and a successful career...

2939
01:39:52,206 --> 01:39:55,105
because it contained people's wish...

2940
01:39:55,106 --> 01:39:58,576
to resemble a certain trait of fish.

2941
01:39:58,816 --> 01:40:00,885
Which trait is it?

2942
01:40:00,886 --> 01:40:03,311
For example, this trait could be...

2943
01:40:03,916 --> 01:40:05,286
something like this.

2944
01:40:05,786 --> 01:40:07,825
Some fishes like salmon...

2945
01:40:07,826 --> 01:40:10,295
go back to their birthplace.

2946
01:40:10,296 --> 01:40:12,050
It could be something like that.

2947
01:40:13,026 --> 01:40:14,465
- Fishes...
- Okay.

2948
01:40:14,466 --> 01:40:16,766
- can't go back.
- Okay.

2949
01:40:16,936 --> 01:40:19,265
They can only go forward, so they represented...

2950
01:40:19,266 --> 01:40:21,605
passing the state exam and succeeding in life.

2951
01:40:21,606 --> 01:40:23,536
They also tend to move up the water.

2952
01:40:24,406 --> 01:40:26,505
Fish don't go backward.

2953
01:40:26,506 --> 01:40:27,575
(The trait of moving forward could represent success in life.)

2954
01:40:27,576 --> 01:40:29,746
They tend to move forward as they break the current.

2955
01:40:30,006 --> 01:40:32,145
- I think it's something like that.
- That's right.

2956
01:40:32,146 --> 01:40:33,945
I like your answer. Let's go.

2957
01:40:33,946 --> 01:40:35,415
Let's go.

2958
01:40:35,416 --> 01:40:36,445
Let's answer quickly.

2959
01:40:36,446 --> 01:40:38,056
That's a good answer.

2960
01:40:38,356 --> 01:40:39,485
Let me answer.

2961
01:40:39,486 --> 01:40:42,285
Fish have a trait of moving forward as they break the current...

2962
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:45,156
because they can't move backward.

2963
01:40:45,426 --> 01:40:47,525
That was why people drew fish.

2964
01:40:47,526 --> 01:40:49,366
They only go forward. They don't go backward.

2965
01:40:50,026 --> 01:40:51,036
Incorrect.

2966
01:40:51,536 --> 01:40:52,636
Which trait is it?

2967
01:40:54,366 --> 01:40:55,405
(Now, it's an individual match.)

2968
01:40:55,406 --> 01:40:56,765
I can't think of other traits.

2969
01:40:56,766 --> 01:40:58,176
If it isn't this one, what could it be?

2970
01:40:59,036 --> 01:41:00,805
Fish go forward.

2971
01:41:00,806 --> 01:41:02,446
(They can't think of a better answer.)

2972
01:41:02,606 --> 01:41:04,215
Let me answer. They lay a lot of eggs.

2973
01:41:04,216 --> 01:41:05,475
(Answer: Laying a lot of eggs)

2974
01:41:05,476 --> 01:41:06,616
Incorrect.

2975
01:41:06,946 --> 01:41:09,015
Let me answer. Fish move...

2976
01:41:09,016 --> 01:41:12,086
without stopping.

2977
01:41:12,486 --> 01:41:15,786
They don't sleep. They move continuously.

2978
01:41:16,226 --> 01:41:18,056
- Incorrect.
- We're nearly there.

2979
01:41:19,126 --> 01:41:22,796
(Hold on. They don't sleep?)

2980
01:41:22,926 --> 01:41:25,136
Let me answer. Fish don't blink.

2981
01:41:25,296 --> 01:41:26,596
- Correct.
- Okay.

2982
01:41:27,006 --> 01:41:28,166
Really?

2983
01:41:28,666 --> 01:41:30,636
- Hold on.
- They don't blink.

2984
01:41:30,836 --> 01:41:33,806
- I said that they didn't sleep.
- Please focus.

2985

(The meaning of fish in eohaedo)

2986
01:41:36,276 --> 01:41:38,415
(As fish always keep their eyes open,)

2987
01:41:38,416 --> 01:41:40,646
(the drawing was seen as an encouragement to study hard.)

2988
01:41:41,146 --> 01:41:43,146
- It's an easy question.
- An easy one.

2989
01:41:43,246 --> 01:41:45,056
One of the fishes you ate just now was brown croaker.

2990
01:41:45,216 --> 01:41:47,985
Brown croaker is one of the fishes that cry.

2991
01:41:47,986 --> 01:41:49,426
(Brown croaker is one of the fishes that cry.)

2992
01:41:49,451 --> 01:41:52,651
It's known to croak like a frog.

2993
01:41:52,826 --> 01:41:55,265
Korean bullhead goes, "Bbaga, bbaga."

2994
01:41:55,266 --> 01:41:57,896
Snapping shrimp goes, "Ttadak, ttadak."

2995
01:41:58,636 --> 01:42:01,505
Then which fish goes, "Squeak, squeak?"

2996
01:42:01,506 --> 01:42:03,506
- I know this one!
- Squeak, squeak?

2997
01:42:03,536 --> 01:42:04,906
- Let me answer.
- Okay.

2998
01:42:05,536 --> 01:42:07,075
- Filefish jerky.
- Filefish jerky?

2999
01:42:07,076 --> 01:42:08,775
- No?
- Filefish jerky?

3000
01:42:08,776 --> 01:42:09,575
- Incorrect.
- I got it.

3001
01:42:10,106 --> 01:42:12,115
- Catfish?
- Catfish is incorrect.

3002
01:42:12,116 --> 01:42:13,375
I got it. Filefish.

3003
01:42:13,376 --> 01:42:14,416
- Filefish?
- Yes.

3004
01:42:14,786 --> 01:42:15,886
Correct.

3005
01:42:16,016 --> 01:42:17,255
- It's the right answer.
- I said it wrong.

3006
01:42:17,256 --> 01:42:18,815
- I said, "Filefish jerky." - That's made of filefish.

3007
01:42:18,816 --> 01:42:23,225
It was practically served on a silver platter!

3008
01:42:23,226 --> 01:42:25,496
- I can't believe this.
- I thought you'd get it.

3009
01:42:25,631 --> 01:42:27,341
I even said, "Filefish jerky."

3010
01:42:27,366 --> 01:42:28,366
(Relieved)

3011
01:42:28,367 --> 01:42:30,865
I'm only paying for watching "Moon Se Yoon Show."

3012
01:42:30,866 --> 01:42:32,673
- Sure.
- Se Yoon is hilarious.

3013
01:42:33,966 --> 01:42:35,835
(Then, here come the closing lines as a courtesy.)

3014
01:42:35,836 --> 01:42:36,906
Good food.

3015
01:42:38,076 --> 01:42:40,036
- Good people.
- He's not done yet.

3016
01:42:40,506 --> 01:42:42,076
And funny stories.

3017
01:42:43,616 --> 01:42:47,216
How could it not be entertaining when these three come together?

3018
01:42:48,721 --> 01:42:50,815
- I had fun while I was here.
- Sure.

3019
01:42:50,816 --> 01:42:52,685
- Thank you.
- "Moon Se Yoon Show!"

3020
01:42:52,686 --> 01:42:54,755
Yes, Handsome Guys!

3021
01:42:54,756 --> 01:42:56,855
(We hope to see you again.)

3022
01:42:56,856 --> 01:42:58,295
Good work today. You were brilliant.

3023
01:42:58,296 --> 01:43:00,425
- Thanks for the food, Tae Hyun!
- No problem.

3024
01:43:00,426 --> 01:43:01,565
- Thanks, Tae Hyun.
- Thank you.

3026

01:43:03,736 --> 01:43:05,066
(The meat is so juicy that your mouth will never feel dry.)

3028
01:43:05,536 --> 01:43:07,935
- You just insert the card.
- Right?

3029
01:43:07,936 --> 01:43:10,066
(You self-checkout as it's the rule here.)

3030
01:43:11,207 --> 01:43:13,475
All right. You just pay like this.

3031
01:43:13,476 --> 01:43:15,746
(Total: 243 dollars)

3032
01:43:16,276 --> 01:43:17,745
I laughed so hard, thanks to Se Yoon.

3033
01:43:17,746 --> 01:43:20,385
I was knee-deep in the charms of Pyeongchang-dong...

3034
01:43:20,386 --> 01:43:21,615
all day.

3035
01:43:21,616 --> 01:43:23,146
(Se Yoon and Pyeongchang-dong kept us happy today.)

3036
01:43:23,177 --> 01:43:25,046
(Next location, Seongsu)

3037
01:43:25,047 --> 01:43:27,516

(as you watch all these amazing restaurants!)

3041
01:43:31,717 --> 01:43:35,816
(A never-ending feast of blessings)

3042
01:43:35,817 --> 01:43:37,787
It's amazing, right?

3043
01:43:38,727 --> 01:43:42,297
(Today's guest shines in broad daylight?)

3044
01:43:44,097 --> 01:43:46,797

(That was very rude. He just got here.)

3047
01:43:50,767 --> 01:43:53,107
(Rhymer will always be the one to pay.)

3048

3049

(His goal is...)

3050
01:43:56,637 --> 01:43:58,506
(to be a freeloader every time.)

3051
01:43:58,507 --> 01:44:00,776
(However)

3052
01:44:00,777 --> 01:44:02,416
(Meditation is incorrect.)

3053
01:44:02,417 --> 01:44:03,817
(The hand is incorrect.)
