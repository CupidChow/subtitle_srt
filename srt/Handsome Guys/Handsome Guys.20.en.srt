1
00:00:15,082 --> 00:00:16,452
The weather is not bad.

2
00:00:16,992 --> 00:00:18,091
The weather is nice.

3
00:00:18,092 --> 00:00:19,221
(Late March in Jung-gu, Seoul)

4
00:00:19,222 --> 00:00:23,531
Our viewers might think that this is a rerun.

5
00:00:23,532 --> 00:00:24,532
- Why? - What?

6
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:26,731
They might think that this is last winter.

7
00:00:26,732 --> 00:00:27,732
(Piled up)

8
00:00:27,733 --> 00:00:29,832
I saw heavy snow at dawn.

9
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,132
I agree. It was heavy snow.

10
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,371
- Thankfully, it stopped snowing. - Yes.

11
00:00:34,372 --> 00:00:35,401
(Thankfully, it stopped snowing. However...)

12
00:00:35,402 --> 00:00:38,571
What's happening today? Usually, there are five of us.

13
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,642
- Yi Kyung. - When one of us is missing,

14
00:00:40,742 --> 00:00:42,541
it's very obvious.

15
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:43,581
- Right. - Yes.

16
00:00:43,582 --> 00:00:45,082
Since Yi Kyung is gone, one more will be kicked out.

17
00:00:46,582 --> 00:00:49,182
Will the members keep going off the show?

18
00:00:50,192 --> 00:00:51,622
They kicked one of us out.

19
00:00:52,622 --> 00:00:55,261
- Always be careful. - Okay.

20
00:00:55,262 --> 00:00:56,861
- Don't forget that. - I'll be careful.

21
00:00:56,862 --> 00:00:58,662
Since last week,

22
00:00:59,062 --> 00:01:01,601
the show became an eating show.

23
00:01:01,602 --> 00:01:02,831
- That's right. - Yes.

24
00:01:02,832 --> 00:01:05,972
To replace Yi Kyung today,

25
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:10,212
we invited someone incredible on the show.

26
00:01:10,772 --> 00:01:12,872
- All right. - I hope that he isn't smart.

27
00:01:13,842 --> 00:01:15,412
He has a great presence.

28
00:01:15,812 --> 00:01:19,381
(He's here!)

29
00:01:19,382 --> 00:01:21,582
- He's one of us. - He's extremely big.

30
00:01:22,282 --> 00:01:23,521
(His great presence stands out even from afar.)

31
00:01:23,522 --> 00:01:25,392
He often treats others to food.

32
00:01:25,952 --> 00:01:27,221
- You're right. - He's very likely...

33
00:01:27,222 --> 00:01:28,622
to pay for our food.

34
00:01:28,962 --> 00:01:30,591
I've competed against him.

35
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:31,991
(Lee Dae Ho, Joseon's Number 4 Batter)

36
00:01:31,992 --> 00:01:33,132
Hello.

37
00:01:33,332 --> 00:01:35,762
- Hello. - Hello.

38
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,301
- I haven't seen you in a long time. - Hello.

39
00:01:37,302 --> 00:01:38,732
- Please come this way. - To the middle.

40
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,341
- It's been a long time. - Dong Hyun.

41
00:01:40,342 --> 00:01:41,601
(His presence is stronger up close.)

42
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:43,542
- Hello. - Hello.

43
00:01:43,572 --> 00:01:45,372
- He's very tall. - Do you eat well?

44
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:49,012
Please say hello briefly to the viewers of Handsome Guys.

45
00:01:49,482 --> 00:01:51,111
Hello, I'm Lee Dae Ho.

46
00:01:51,112 --> 00:01:53,981
I was invited to be here today.

47
00:01:53,982 --> 00:01:55,421
We'll be spending a good time.

48
00:01:55,422 --> 00:01:56,492
It's good to see you.

49
00:01:57,192 --> 00:02:01,061
Have you been informed about what kind of show this is?

50
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:03,692
First of all, the show is called Handsome Guys.

51
00:02:03,892 --> 00:02:05,392
(However...)

52
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,162
(Looking around)

53
00:02:08,902 --> 00:02:12,231
(Gosh, you're too honest.)

54
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,801
Are they Team Handsome, and are you Team Guys?

55
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:15,071
- You're also on Team Guys. - I see.

56
00:02:15,072 --> 00:02:17,241
- You should be precise. - All of you...

57
00:02:17,242 --> 00:02:19,671
All of you are handsome except Dong Hyun.

58
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:22,041
The two of us are Team Guys.

59
00:02:22,042 --> 00:02:23,781
We're all Handsome Guys.

60
00:02:23,782 --> 00:02:27,982
Today, even I seem like a small eater like Tae Hyun.

61
00:02:28,422 --> 00:02:31,091
- He can eat a lot of food. - By the way,

62
00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:33,291
I heard that it wasn't true.

63
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:35,691
Right, I don't eat a lot.

64
00:02:35,692 --> 00:02:38,361
- That's what I heard too. - I only eat a lot when it's good.

65
00:02:38,362 --> 00:02:39,461
(Dae Ho's eating philosophy: Eat a lot when it's delicious.)

66
00:02:39,462 --> 00:02:41,361
- When the food is bad... - I don't eat bad food.

67
00:02:41,362 --> 00:02:44,171
Then are you a gourmand or a gourmet?

68
00:02:44,172 --> 00:02:45,872
Are you a small gourmand?

69
00:02:46,002 --> 00:02:47,971
- He's both. - What would you call yourself?

70
00:02:47,972 --> 00:02:50,241
- I only eat a lot of tasty food. - Only tasty food?

71
00:02:50,242 --> 00:02:53,041
Whatever you don't eat is bad, isn't it?

72
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:55,111
- Yes, I put down the chopsticks. - It's like...

73
00:02:55,112 --> 00:02:56,382
I'm objective.

74
00:02:56,712 --> 00:02:58,811
- That's nice. - Most people are picky...

75
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,251
about good food.

76
00:03:00,252 --> 00:03:01,722
However, Dae Ho likes most food.

77
00:03:02,352 --> 00:03:03,991
- He enjoys almost anything. - Wait.

78
00:03:03,992 --> 00:03:05,291
- Bad food for him is rare. - Wait.

79
00:03:05,292 --> 00:03:07,221
- Are you sure? - You eat unless it's out of date.

80
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:08,961
Dong Hyun, who are you to judge my palate?

81
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:10,161
I've seen you eat often.

82
00:03:10,162 --> 00:03:11,491
- That's not true. - He enjoys almost anything.

83
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:12,861
What food do you not like?

84
00:03:12,862 --> 00:03:14,961
- There's a lot that I don't like. - Like what?

85
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,831
I don't usually eat noodles.

86
00:03:16,832 --> 00:03:17,832
- You don't eat noodles? - What?

87
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:19,531
- Noodles? - How many packets of ramyeon?

88
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,172
I don't usually eat more than two packets.

89
00:03:22,642 --> 00:03:24,941
- He doesn't eat noodles? - I enjoy up to two packets.

90
00:03:24,942 --> 00:03:26,172
What about naengmyeon?

91
00:03:26,312 --> 00:03:27,942
I don't really like naengmyeon either.

92
00:03:28,112 --> 00:03:29,441
I've never had more than a bowl of naengmyeon.

93
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:31,382
How many portions of pork belly can you eat?

94
00:03:31,912 --> 00:03:33,052
I can eat it endlessly.

95
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:36,351
- Goodness. - I can eat a lot of it.

96
00:03:36,352 --> 00:03:37,822
I've never heard of anyone eat it endlessly.

97
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:39,722
- Endlessly? - Endlessly.

98
00:03:40,322 --> 00:03:41,322
He can eat it endlessly.

99
00:03:41,323 --> 00:03:42,692
- Then today... - Endlessly.

100
00:03:42,962 --> 00:03:44,792
In the end,

101
00:03:44,832 --> 00:03:47,161
- Dae Ho is 1 of us. - You're 1 of us.

102
00:03:47,162 --> 00:03:49,362
You're a big eater after all.

103
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:52,531
I hope that there will be a lot of meat today.

104
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:55,102
Today's location is Eulji-ro.

105
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:57,771
There are many traditional markets in Eulji-ro.

106
00:03:57,772 --> 00:03:58,941
(Traditional market)

107
00:03:58,942 --> 00:04:00,812
As you can see next to us, there are lighting shops.

108
00:04:01,382 --> 00:04:03,312
Right? There are many lighting shops.

109
00:04:03,482 --> 00:04:06,111
Also, there are many print shops.

110
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,381
Particularly, there are many old shops here.

111
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,191
- Old stores. - Old stores.

112
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:11,491
You're right, Tae Hyun.

113
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:14,292
Among young people, Eulji-ro is called "Hipji-ro."

114
00:04:14,662 --> 00:04:16,631
- Because it's hip? - It has a trendy atmosphere.

115
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:19,561
Now that the time has passed,

116
00:04:19,562 --> 00:04:21,761
old stores are considered hip.

117
00:04:21,762 --> 00:04:23,701
There are many trendy restaurants and cafes.

118
00:04:23,702 --> 00:04:26,642
- There are so many. - The street has a hip atmosphere.

119
00:04:26,872 --> 00:04:28,072
That's why this place is so popular.

120
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,241
- Guys, have you heard... - What?

121
00:04:30,242 --> 00:04:31,572
Of Manseon Hof?

122
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:33,211
- "Manseon Hof?" - "Manseon Hof?"

123
00:04:33,212 --> 00:04:36,042
When the weather is nice, it turns into a night market.

124
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:37,552
With outdoor tables?

125
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:40,282
I think I saw it while passing by.

126
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:41,981
Isn't this place also famous...

127
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,491
- for young pollack and whelk? - That's right.

128
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:44,991
- EW. - "EW?"

129
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:46,092
- Eulji-ro Whelk. - Eulji-ro Whelk.

130
00:04:46,352 --> 00:04:48,391
- Like Eulji-ro Young Pollack? - I haven't heard of any.

131
00:04:48,392 --> 00:04:50,262
It's me who abbreviated Eulji-ro Whelk.

132
00:04:51,062 --> 00:04:53,362
- What's wrong with him? - Seriously?

133
00:04:53,732 --> 00:04:55,532
I thought that EW existed.

134
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,231
(I was joking.)

135
00:04:57,232 --> 00:04:59,841
I would've embarrassed myself for using that word.

136
00:04:59,842 --> 00:05:01,241
- I know. - In front of young people,

137
00:05:01,242 --> 00:05:03,271
- I'd say, "Have you had EW?" - EW.

138
00:05:03,272 --> 00:05:04,372
They wouldn't understand.

139
00:05:04,742 --> 00:05:08,081
Today, we will become office workers in Eulji-ro.

140
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:12,512
We will eat lunch and dinner.

141
00:05:13,952 --> 00:05:16,522
(Office workers in Eulji-ro)

142
00:05:16,822 --> 00:05:18,952
(Their biggest concern on their way to and from work)

143
00:05:19,092 --> 00:05:21,062
(What shall we eat for lunch and dinner today?)

144
00:05:23,262 --> 00:05:26,832
(Among so many dishes in Eulji-ro)

145
00:05:28,102 --> 00:05:32,602
(What's Handsome Guys' lunch recommendation to Eulji-ro workers?)

146
00:05:33,102 --> 00:05:35,342
What shall we eat?

147
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:37,072
What sounds good?

148
00:05:37,772 --> 00:05:38,842
There are so many choices.

149
00:05:39,012 --> 00:05:42,541
Dae Ho, what do you usually eat for lunch?

150
00:05:42,542 --> 00:05:44,881
What athletes eat the most is...

151
00:05:44,882 --> 00:05:47,381
- galbitang. It's nice and simple. - Galbitang?

152
00:05:47,382 --> 00:05:49,552
When we crave something spicy, we go for kimchi stew.

153
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,252
- Kimchi stew? - That's right.

154
00:05:51,352 --> 00:05:52,692
- Or gukbap. - Gukbap?

155
00:05:52,892 --> 00:05:54,091
We like simple dishes.

156
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:55,461
- How about stir-fried pork? - That's good.

157
00:05:55,462 --> 00:05:56,731
- Stir-fried pork. - That's good.

158
00:05:56,732 --> 00:05:58,392
- Stir-fried pork. - That's a great idea.

159
00:05:58,892 --> 00:06:00,062
- Right? - Right.

160
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:01,761
- You don't get tired of it. - Exactly.

161
00:06:01,762 --> 00:06:04,631
I heard that there was also chicken gomtang.

162
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:06,741
- Chicken gomtang? - Chicken gomtang sounds good too.

163
00:06:06,742 --> 00:06:08,271
- Chicken gomtang sounds good. - I agree.

164
00:06:08,272 --> 00:06:09,871
- It's nice and clean. - Chicken gomtang isn't spicy.

165
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:12,272
I know that one of the nearby restaurants sells...

166
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:14,081
kimchi stew with a lot of pork.

167
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,311
- Really? - It's a tasty restaurant.

168
00:06:15,312 --> 00:06:16,381
- Really? - Yes.

169
00:06:16,382 --> 00:06:19,051
The bowls are so old that they're dented.

170
00:06:19,052 --> 00:06:21,151
- The bowls also have a charm. - When you grab some kimchi,

171
00:06:21,152 --> 00:06:23,121
the lettuce is so old that it's transparent.

172
00:06:23,122 --> 00:06:24,151
- And it's soft? - Yes.

173
00:06:24,152 --> 00:06:26,591
When you grab some kimchi, it tears on its own.

174
00:06:26,592 --> 00:06:27,722
That's it.

175
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:29,322
It's a bit sour.

176
00:06:30,332 --> 00:06:32,531
- There should be a lot of meat. - There is.

177
00:06:32,532 --> 00:06:34,902
- The meat is cut. - Let's do this for today.

178
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:38,332
Let's split between chicken gomtang and kimchi stew for lunch.

179
00:06:38,472 --> 00:06:39,772
That sounds good.

180
00:06:40,342 --> 00:06:42,202
Gosh, it's hard to choose.

181
00:06:43,542 --> 00:06:45,641
I choose... I like chicken gomtang too.

182
00:06:45,642 --> 00:06:46,711
(They can't decide easily.)

183
00:06:46,712 --> 00:06:47,742
- Goodness. - Okay.

184
00:06:48,782 --> 00:06:50,512
Which one should I choose? I pick chicken gomtang.

185
00:06:51,182 --> 00:06:55,721
I'll order additional pork.

186
00:06:55,722 --> 00:06:56,821
- Kimchi stew? - I'll go for kimchi stew.

187
00:06:56,822 --> 00:06:58,751
- Great, I'll join you. - Okay.

188
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,121
Kimchi stew with additional pork.

189
00:07:01,122 --> 00:07:02,721
There's more pork than kimchi.

190
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:05,031
Exactly. That sounds good.

191
00:07:05,032 --> 00:07:06,131
- Is that so? - That sounds good.

192
00:07:06,132 --> 00:07:08,002
- Pork stew. - Pork stew.

193
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:09,162
I'll go for chicken gomtang.

194
00:07:09,632 --> 00:07:12,671
It's excellent with seasoned chicken.

195
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:14,471
- Okay. - It's light and perfect for lunch.

196
00:07:14,472 --> 00:07:15,501
It sounds very delicious.

197
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:16,502
It's 2 against 2.

198
00:07:17,042 --> 00:07:18,141
Which team will you join?

199
00:07:18,142 --> 00:07:19,541
(What will be Seung Ho's choice?)

200
00:07:19,542 --> 00:07:20,782
I'll go for chicken gomtang.

201
00:07:21,242 --> 00:07:22,512
Is it to get the quiz right?

202
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:25,811
- Hold on. Seung Ho kept saying... - Is it for the quiz?

203
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:27,321
That he wanted kimchi stew.

204
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:28,722
You're right.

205
00:07:28,952 --> 00:07:30,852
I wasn't thinking about the quiz.

206
00:07:31,722 --> 00:07:32,752
The two of us?

207
00:07:33,422 --> 00:07:36,162
- Dong Hyun, we'll eat first. - What's wrong with him?

208
00:07:36,392 --> 00:07:37,791
Then we wouldn't be jealous of them.

209
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:40,101
We don't know when we'll eat, but here's what's important.

210
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:41,801
- We'll be given a question. - He doesn't know yet.

211
00:07:41,802 --> 00:07:44,431
If we get the right answer, the others will pay for our food.

212
00:07:44,432 --> 00:07:46,771
Kimchi stew and chicken gomtang don't cost a lot.

213
00:07:46,772 --> 00:07:48,371
- We can pay. - He's right.

214
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:49,802
That's the right attitude.

215
00:07:50,772 --> 00:07:52,811
Even if you eat a lot, kimchi stew won't cost a lot.

216
00:07:52,812 --> 00:07:54,011
There aren't many of us.

217
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:55,282
(Here comes Generous Dae Ho.)

218
00:07:55,482 --> 00:07:56,612
Okay.

219
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,051
What if we get it wrong? Aren't you competitive?

220
00:07:58,052 --> 00:07:59,212
I'm not competitive.

221
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,821
- I just want to enjoy the food. - It's not like you won't get food.

222
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:03,052
It could be very infuriating.

223
00:08:04,022 --> 00:08:09,322
(Team Kimchi Stew, Team Chicken Gomtang)

224
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:11,091
The kimchi stew restaurant is closer,

225
00:08:11,092 --> 00:08:12,932
so we'll go there first.

226
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:14,232
Yes.

227
00:08:14,233 --> 00:08:16,632
(Good news for their empty stomach)

228
00:08:16,732 --> 00:08:18,071
Will you be okay?

229
00:08:18,072 --> 00:08:20,602
We have to watch them eat kimchi stew on an empty stomach?

230
00:08:20,972 --> 00:08:22,571
Wait a minute.

231
00:08:22,572 --> 00:08:23,671
(I'll join the other team.)

232
00:08:23,672 --> 00:08:26,241
Will you be okay? You can't change your choice.

233
00:08:26,242 --> 00:08:29,241
Let's go and eat kimchi stew first.

234
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:30,711
- Let's go. - Let's go.

235
00:08:30,712 --> 00:08:32,111
Okay.

236
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:34,121
- I want to eat first. - We get to eat first.

237
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:35,752
For lunch, we have to eat first.

238
00:08:38,292 --> 00:08:41,862
(Along the Old Seoul Street in Eulji-ro)

239
00:08:42,162 --> 00:08:46,692
(In search for tasty restaurants for lunch that office workers love)

240
00:08:46,962 --> 00:08:48,101
(They arrive on the street of Bangsan Market.)

241
00:08:48,102 --> 00:08:50,371
- The atmosphere is... - Gosh.

242
00:08:50,372 --> 00:08:52,031
The alleys are filled with tasty restaurants.

243
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:53,402
There are tasty restaurants on every alley.

244
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:54,442
A place like this...

245
00:08:54,443 --> 00:08:56,872
- It's been around for ten years. - You must go in without thinking.

246
00:08:57,742 --> 00:08:59,271
The time has stopped.

247
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,742
(It seems like the time stopped on the street.)

248
00:09:00,882 --> 00:09:02,742
I feel like I've seen this before.

249
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:05,052
A meat restaurant?

250
00:09:06,782 --> 00:09:09,882
(Hidden on an alley in Eulji-ro)

251
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,052
Jujeong?

252
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:13,522
The signboard and the name...

253
00:09:14,022 --> 00:09:15,162
This is definitely a tasty restaurant.

254
00:09:15,962 --> 00:09:17,762
The food has to be delicious here.

255
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:19,932
It's already crowded.

256
00:09:20,462 --> 00:09:21,662
It's packed.

257
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:23,402
Yes, it's lunchtime.

258
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,071
(When lunchtime starts, )

259
00:09:26,072 --> 00:09:27,942
(the customers gather 1 by 1.)

260
00:09:28,242 --> 00:09:31,072
(The Eulji-ro lunch mecca gets crowded.)

261
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:36,212
(Not only the main hall on the 1st floor)

262
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,982
(Both the 1st and the 2nd floors are packed with customers.)

263
00:09:40,282 --> 00:09:41,882
(There's a notice during lunchtime.)

264
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,722
(One-person customer must arrive after 1:30pm.)

265
00:09:45,652 --> 00:09:53,562
(The kimchi stew has been loved by everyone for 40 years.)

266
00:09:54,402 --> 00:09:57,332
(Are you curious about the taste?)

267
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,502
(Lunch Menu Recommendation 1, kimchi stew)

268
00:10:02,572 --> 00:10:04,242
(They enter right away.)

269
00:10:04,372 --> 00:10:05,612
There are so many people.

270
00:10:06,042 --> 00:10:08,341
Hello. Gosh, the smell.

271
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:09,982
(It smells delicious as soon as they enter.)

272
00:10:10,982 --> 00:10:12,682
It looks like an amazing restaurant.

273
00:10:12,752 --> 00:10:14,881
Hello.

274
00:10:14,882 --> 00:10:15,882
(Although it's a little past lunchtime, )

275
00:10:15,883 --> 00:10:16,891
(it's filled with customers who are eating.)

276
00:10:16,892 --> 00:10:17,952
It has to be good.

277
00:10:18,252 --> 00:10:19,392
It's also crowded here.

278
00:10:21,292 --> 00:10:23,792
(It's also full on the 2nd floor.)

279
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:25,392
The pot looks delicious.

280
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:28,032
- Hello. - Hello.

281
00:10:28,902 --> 00:10:30,432
This place is amazing.

282
00:10:30,972 --> 00:10:33,032
- It's incredible here. - I know.

283
00:10:33,402 --> 00:10:35,402
- I should take off my jacket. - It's incredible here.

284
00:10:35,442 --> 00:10:36,841
I might sweat.

285
00:10:36,842 --> 00:10:38,272
You might sweat?

286
00:10:38,342 --> 00:10:39,841
Goodness.

287
00:10:39,842 --> 00:10:42,312
Coming here made me realize clearly...

288
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:46,211
that many office workers eat kimchi stew.

289
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,251
For lunch.

290
00:10:47,252 --> 00:10:49,621
The restaurant is huge. The first floor is big.

291
00:10:49,622 --> 00:10:50,991
It even has second floor,

292
00:10:50,992 --> 00:10:52,591
- and it's packed with customers. - Right.

293
00:10:52,592 --> 00:10:54,421
- Hello. - Hello.

294
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:56,091
- You must be the restaurant owner. - Yes.

295
00:10:56,092 --> 00:10:58,031
She's clearly the restaurant owner.

296
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,461
All of you look handsome.

297
00:10:59,462 --> 00:11:02,531
Your kimchi stew...

298
00:11:02,532 --> 00:11:03,971
You have a presence.

299
00:11:03,972 --> 00:11:06,431
People wait in line to eat our kimchi stew.

300
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,602
(Speaking of our kimchi stew...)

301
00:11:10,472 --> 00:11:14,242
(A generous portion of Korean pork from Iksan is added.)

302
00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:18,612
(Fresh vegetables delivered to the restaurant everyday)

303
00:11:19,582 --> 00:11:24,052
(Wrapping the meat in the vegetables is the restaurant's specialty.)

304
00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:25,791
Try it.

305
00:11:25,792 --> 00:11:27,091
(Try it first.)

306
00:11:27,092 --> 00:11:29,161
For kimchi stew...

307
00:11:29,162 --> 00:11:30,531
- Three orders. - Three orders?

308
00:11:30,532 --> 00:11:31,561
Three orders of kimchi stew.

309
00:11:31,562 --> 00:11:32,831
- Can we order additional meat? - Additional.

310
00:11:32,832 --> 00:11:35,161
Yes, I'll bring one order of additional meat.

311
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,931
- That sounds good. - One order?

312
00:11:36,932 --> 00:11:38,871
- Please give us a lot of meat. - Sure.

313
00:11:38,872 --> 00:11:39,901
Please wait one moment.

314
00:11:39,902 --> 00:11:41,342
- Thank you. - Thank you.

315
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:43,972
You know what?

316
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:45,712
- It'll be hard to resist. - Right.

317
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,481
Should we switch?

318
00:11:47,482 --> 00:11:49,081
- There is also jjolmyeon. - It will be hard to resist.

319
00:11:49,082 --> 00:11:52,411
Can you watch us eat Korean's favorite dish, pork kimchi stew...

320
00:11:52,412 --> 00:11:54,082
on an empty stomach in the morning?

321
00:11:54,382 --> 00:11:56,051
(Starting to act up)

322
00:11:56,052 --> 00:11:58,451
Could you give them the quiz earlier?

323
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,091
The food isn't here yet.

324
00:12:00,092 --> 00:12:01,521
- I'm talking about later. - I mean...

325
00:12:01,522 --> 00:12:03,062
We didn't get any food yet.

326
00:12:03,162 --> 00:12:05,431
Tae Hyun, you aren't interested in food.

327
00:12:05,432 --> 00:12:06,861
I'm hungry right now.

328
00:12:06,862 --> 00:12:07,931
(I'm hungry right now.)

329
00:12:07,932 --> 00:12:09,331
That's not fair.

330
00:12:09,332 --> 00:12:10,501
Right. We can't say...

331
00:12:10,502 --> 00:12:12,001
- that Tae Hyun doesn't eat. - Of course not.

332
00:12:12,002 --> 00:12:13,741
- I'm a normal person. - Right.

333
00:12:13,742 --> 00:12:15,542
As I was walking in here,

334
00:12:15,642 --> 00:12:17,212
I kept thinking about begging for food.

335
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:18,811
- While walking from there? - Yes.

336
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:20,682
"Shall I go and beg for food?"

337
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:22,041
If Seung Ho disappears,

338
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,012
he might be coming up with acrostic poems.

339
00:12:24,082 --> 00:12:25,681
- Be careful. - Acrostic poems?

340
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:27,721
An acrostic poem with "kimchi stew."

341
00:12:27,722 --> 00:12:30,052
I should get warmed up.

342
00:12:30,222 --> 00:12:32,621
Even though we're big eaters...

343
00:12:32,622 --> 00:12:33,622
It's here.

344
00:12:33,623 --> 00:12:35,621
Here are 3 orders with 1 extra order of meat.

345
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:36,622
(The kimchi stew appears.)

346
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:37,691
This is...

347
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:38,932
(Amazing)

348
00:12:39,332 --> 00:12:41,001
Ma'am, isn't it this high?

349
00:12:41,002 --> 00:12:42,532
- Is this for four people? - Right?

350
00:12:42,602 --> 00:12:44,671
- By the way... - The meat is thinly sliced.

351
00:12:44,672 --> 00:12:46,601
- Look at this. - This is delicious.

352
00:12:46,602 --> 00:12:48,602
- It's how mom used to make it. - Right.

353
00:12:49,072 --> 00:12:50,711
(Inhaling)

354
00:12:50,712 --> 00:12:52,912
Tae Hyun, pork should have one layer...

355
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:54,711
over the fat.

356
00:12:54,712 --> 00:12:55,942
Sometimes, there's hair on it.

357
00:12:56,012 --> 00:12:57,712
I feel disappointed when there's no hair.

358
00:12:57,852 --> 00:13:00,351
Sometimes, there's a print... What is it?

359
00:13:00,352 --> 00:13:01,782
- "Examined." - There's an examination stamp.

360
00:13:01,882 --> 00:13:03,151
It has to be stamped.

361
00:13:03,152 --> 00:13:04,852
- It's stamped in blue ink. - When you look...

362
00:13:05,452 --> 00:13:07,422
- This is... - There are also vegetables.

363
00:13:07,492 --> 00:13:09,222
To make wraps?

364
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:10,862
- I mean... - Is this a wrap restaurant?

365
00:13:11,592 --> 00:13:13,461
- Is this a wrap restaurant? - You can't even see the bottom.

366
00:13:13,462 --> 00:13:15,032
It's like pork stew.

367
00:13:15,932 --> 00:13:18,071
The vegetables are very fresh.

368
00:13:18,072 --> 00:13:19,072
Would you like some water?

369
00:13:19,302 --> 00:13:21,202
The doenjang looks authentic too.

370
00:13:21,402 --> 00:13:23,001
- Here you go. - What are you doing?

371
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:24,172
You startled me.

372
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:26,241
Tae Hyun, why are you doing this?

373
00:13:26,242 --> 00:13:27,941
- No. - Stay still.

374
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:29,341
- Gosh. - It's okay.

375
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,952
Just stay still.

376
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,781
Who gave us water? I just noticed the cups.

377
00:13:33,782 --> 00:13:36,082
- I brought the water. - Really? Okay.

378
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:37,951
- I'll give you one point. - Thank you.

379
00:13:37,952 --> 00:13:39,752
(Where is Sang Uk going?)

380
00:13:41,492 --> 00:13:42,762
Look over here.

381
00:13:43,192 --> 00:13:44,861
He brought aprons.

382
00:13:44,862 --> 00:13:46,792
- What's wrong with everyone? - I'll give you one point.

383
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:49,501
Why are you doing this?

384
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:51,602
(You're making us feel uncomfortable.)

385
00:13:52,972 --> 00:13:54,701
(Lastly, warm white rice is served.)

386
00:13:54,702 --> 00:13:56,142
It's exactly for one person.

387
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,111
The rice is served in this bowl...

388
00:13:59,112 --> 00:14:00,441
- so we can mix it with the stew. - Right.

389
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:01,741
(To mix it with the stew)

390
00:14:01,742 --> 00:14:04,352
(The meal starts.)

391
00:14:04,812 --> 00:14:06,282
To start with,

392
00:14:06,652 --> 00:14:07,881
a wrap only with salted innards.

393
00:14:07,882 --> 00:14:09,281
(Topping salted innards)

394
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,521
- Only that? - Yes.

395
00:14:10,522 --> 00:14:12,422
(Eating a salted innards wrap)

396
00:14:12,492 --> 00:14:14,592
(Falling in)

397
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:17,991
Dong Hyun looks like someone...

398
00:14:17,992 --> 00:14:20,332
who gets beaten easily in the UFC.

399
00:14:20,862 --> 00:14:22,501
- You know what? - His opponent would lose...

400
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:25,131
- from making a big move. - Exactly.

401
00:14:25,132 --> 00:14:27,802
He passes out when he loses.

402
00:14:27,872 --> 00:14:29,242
If you throw a punch, I'll dodge.

403
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:30,711
(Goodness)

404
00:14:30,712 --> 00:14:32,111
I bet this is how he plays.

405
00:14:32,112 --> 00:14:33,141
I'll dodge.

406
00:14:33,142 --> 00:14:34,312
(While Dong Hyun is acting annoying)

407
00:14:34,442 --> 00:14:37,982
(Dae Ho is focusing only on the kimchi stew.)

408
00:14:38,182 --> 00:14:40,152
- It looks so good. - Do you have ramyeon noodles?

409
00:14:40,752 --> 00:14:43,052
Half of it is solid ingredients.

410
00:14:44,452 --> 00:14:46,521
- Let me serve you some meat. - Thank you.

411
00:14:46,522 --> 00:14:47,961
Let's start with the meat.

412
00:14:47,962 --> 00:14:49,162
Don't you like this?

413
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:51,331
There's an endless amount of meat.

414
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:53,092
(Inside the kimchi stew)

415
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:56,162
Gosh, what's this?

416
00:14:56,202 --> 00:14:58,171
- I gave you a lot of meat. - Thank you.

417
00:14:58,172 --> 00:14:59,272
- Okay. - It's hot.

418
00:14:59,372 --> 00:15:00,942
Eighty percent of the stew is meat.

419
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:04,012
(Half meat, half kimchi)

420
00:15:04,672 --> 00:15:06,872
It has so much meat inside.

421
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:10,312
(How does the kimchi stew taste in a wrap?)

422
00:15:11,282 --> 00:15:13,882
There's more in the pot than what they served themselves.

423
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:16,281
I feel so excited.

424
00:15:16,282 --> 00:15:17,351
(He puts a big chunk of meat.)

425
00:15:17,352 --> 00:15:18,451
There's only meat.

426
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:19,721
(He puts three big chunks of meat.)

427
00:15:19,722 --> 00:15:21,022
With garlic,

428
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:22,421
should I put doenjang or salted innards?

429
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:24,462
- Salted innards are delicious. - Salted innards?

430
00:15:24,892 --> 00:15:26,491
Would this much salted innards be salty?

431
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:28,362
There's chili. I got lucky.

432
00:15:28,632 --> 00:15:29,832
Add some garlic.

433
00:15:30,432 --> 00:15:32,732
Gosh, this is so exciting.

434
00:15:33,302 --> 00:15:34,442
Please don't drop...

435
00:15:34,602 --> 00:15:37,472
(Staring)

436
00:15:37,942 --> 00:15:39,272
I feel bad.

437
00:15:41,012 --> 00:15:42,912
(Those in the 1st row suffer from watching him eat.)

438
00:15:43,912 --> 00:15:45,452
(Sighing)

439
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:46,581
In one go without dropping.

440
00:15:46,582 --> 00:15:48,852
He eats a lot. You were wrong about him.

441
00:15:48,952 --> 00:15:50,121
This is amazing.

442
00:15:50,122 --> 00:15:51,792
(Take a look at me too.)

443
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:57,232
Sang Uk, this is driving me insane.

444
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,532
Why do I keep making wrong choices?

445
00:16:00,602 --> 00:16:02,662
I picked fine-dining last week.

446
00:16:03,532 --> 00:16:05,971
(Moving about)

447
00:16:05,972 --> 00:16:07,272
Did you put it all in?

448
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:11,542
The smell is making it worse.

449
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:14,712
- This is a torture. - Lastly, a spoon of broth.

450
00:16:15,512 --> 00:16:16,711
Dong Hyun, I'm sorry to say this,

451
00:16:16,712 --> 00:16:18,852
but I hope that you'll spill it on your pants.

452
00:16:19,682 --> 00:16:22,052
(Being mean for no reason)

453
00:16:22,422 --> 00:16:25,152
(He savors the meat quietly next to Dong Hyun.)

454
00:16:31,592 --> 00:16:34,332
The deep flavor of kimchi seasoned the meat.

455
00:16:34,902 --> 00:16:38,872
It's very rich.

456
00:16:39,402 --> 00:16:40,531
(Sniffing)

457
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,701
It's more painful to resist because I know how it tastes.

458
00:16:42,702 --> 00:16:44,112
- Seriously. - Lastly, the broth.

459
00:16:44,372 --> 00:16:46,212
There are many tasty kimchi stew restaurants.

460
00:16:46,372 --> 00:16:48,412
All kimchi stew is good,

461
00:16:48,482 --> 00:16:50,982
but some percentage is different. I can taste the difference.

462
00:16:51,612 --> 00:16:53,352
He's talking so much that it's annoying.

463
00:16:54,382 --> 00:16:55,781
Seriously.

464
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,522
We don't need to go to a meat restaurant.

465
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:00,762
- It's very delicious. - Goodness.

466
00:17:01,492 --> 00:17:04,161
They can make wraps because there's so much meat.

467
00:17:04,162 --> 00:17:05,992
- I'll mix it with the rice. - Yes.

468
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:08,262
Give me more meat.

469
00:17:08,502 --> 00:17:10,731
- It's the delicious kind. - Thank you.

470
00:17:10,732 --> 00:17:12,231
(Piled up)

471
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:13,531
(Mixing)

472
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,871
This looks amazing.

473
00:17:14,872 --> 00:17:17,542
Kimchi in the mix would be so delicious.

474
00:17:20,442 --> 00:17:23,412
(Dancing)

475
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:28,222
Now I realize why Yi Kyung said Dong Hyun as a hint.

476
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:29,552
Was the answer "annoying?"

477
00:17:29,722 --> 00:17:31,691
Actually, he's more than annoying.

478
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:34,062
Please add a glass of water as CGI.

479
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:37,562
What's wrong? I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

480
00:17:38,232 --> 00:17:39,292
I didn't hear you.

481
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:41,701
Pieces with a thick layer of fat are good.

482
00:17:41,702 --> 00:17:43,002
I know, you punk.

483
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:45,631
- I see it too. - This is...

484
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:46,672
(I see it too.)

485
00:17:47,272 --> 00:17:49,441
(He filled his mouth with a kimchi stew wrap.)

486
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:50,871
(A sip of broth when it's hard to swallow)

487
00:17:50,872 --> 00:17:52,242
Gosh, the meat is...

488
00:17:52,312 --> 00:17:55,341
I won't eat it, but there's something I want to show you.

489
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:56,482
These aren't used.

490
00:17:56,812 --> 00:17:57,851
I like this piece.

491
00:17:57,852 --> 00:17:59,652
This is what Dong Hyun mentioned.

492
00:18:01,152 --> 00:18:02,281
Is this it?

493
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:04,391
Is that so?

494
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:05,821
This is really...

495
00:18:05,822 --> 00:18:07,251
- Try it. - This is it.

496
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,992
Seriously, try it.

497
00:18:14,532 --> 00:18:16,101
When you eat that piece of meat,

498
00:18:16,102 --> 00:18:18,101
- it's slightly crunchy, you know? - Exactly.

499
00:18:18,102 --> 00:18:19,572
- Goodness. - One person can't eat.

500
00:18:20,202 --> 00:18:21,871
- Would you like more meat? - Can you give me tofu?

501
00:18:21,872 --> 00:18:23,171
- Do you like tofu? - Yes.

502
00:18:23,172 --> 00:18:27,542
(A hidden delicacy in the kimchi stew)

503
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:35,752
Let me try it. Gosh, look at the tofu.

504
00:18:35,822 --> 00:18:37,852
- Look at the tofu. - It's an entire chunk of tofu.

505
00:18:38,052 --> 00:18:40,192
- What's this? - Most places don't serve this.

506
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:42,392
How is it so big?

507
00:18:42,662 --> 00:18:44,992
This is driving me crazy.

508
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:47,661
The tofu is well-made.

509
00:18:47,662 --> 00:18:49,962
Yes, it's very thick.

510
00:18:51,232 --> 00:18:53,171
This is driving me crazy.

511
00:18:53,172 --> 00:18:54,671
The meat is very tender.

512
00:18:54,672 --> 00:18:57,142
Gosh, even if it's thick. Don't you agree?

513
00:18:57,642 --> 00:18:59,772
The tofu is also thick.

514
00:19:00,042 --> 00:19:01,882
It's thick and dry.

515
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:04,011
I should try it by itself.

516
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:05,282
I should eat it like this.

517
00:19:08,252 --> 00:19:09,721
This is crazy.

518
00:19:09,722 --> 00:19:10,952
I'm about to lose my mind.

519
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:16,692
(Eating kimchi stew like he's possessed)

520
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:24,631
(Also, the meat is coming out endlessly.)

521
00:19:24,632 --> 00:19:28,771
We're here on a day when kimchi stew tastes delicious.

522
00:19:28,772 --> 00:19:30,541
- Right. - It's snowing outside.

523
00:19:30,542 --> 00:19:32,241
- Because it's cold? - There was heavy snow at dawn.

524
00:19:32,242 --> 00:19:33,441
It snowed today.

525
00:19:33,442 --> 00:19:34,711
I wasn't thinking about that, so thank you.

526
00:19:34,712 --> 00:19:35,782
It became even tastier.

527
00:19:36,512 --> 00:19:37,952
If you're thankful, give me a bite.

528
00:19:38,252 --> 00:19:39,252
My arms are shaking.

529
00:19:39,253 --> 00:19:40,681
Gosh, it's hot.

530
00:19:40,682 --> 00:19:42,281
This is how much he's enjoying it.

531
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:43,951
He scooped up the meat...

532
00:19:43,952 --> 00:19:45,551
and the broth to put it on his wrap.

533
00:19:45,552 --> 00:19:47,562
(Check)

534
00:19:47,592 --> 00:19:49,162
Gosh, it's hot.

535
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:50,222
What's wrong with you?

536
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,691
He scooped up the meat...

537
00:19:51,692 --> 00:19:53,431
and the broth to put it on his wrap.

538
00:19:53,432 --> 00:19:54,762
I know.

539
00:19:54,832 --> 00:19:56,531
- He's spilling the broth. - He's spilling.

540
00:19:56,532 --> 00:19:58,202
What is he doing?

541
00:19:58,302 --> 00:20:00,572
Dong Hyun and Dae Ho.

542
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,201
Why don't you give us a quiz?

543
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:03,741
Shall we do it now?

544
00:20:03,742 --> 00:20:05,612
- It takes a long time to answer. - Okay.

545
00:20:05,642 --> 00:20:06,842
For one person.

546
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,981
- No way. - Two people.

547
00:20:08,982 --> 00:20:10,411
- What? - One person can't eat.

548
00:20:10,412 --> 00:20:11,951
What's wrong with you, all of a sudden?

549
00:20:11,952 --> 00:20:14,122
- Let's start with 1 person. - Just 1 person?

550
00:20:15,252 --> 00:20:17,621
- He changed the rule again. - What's wrong with him?

551
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:19,621
Why did Tae Hyun pick chicken gomtang?

552
00:20:19,622 --> 00:20:22,091
(Laughing)

553
00:20:22,092 --> 00:20:23,221
However,

554
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,092
I'll let you take one scoop as big as you want.

555
00:20:25,932 --> 00:20:27,932
- One scoop into your bowl. - One?

556
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:30,501
Why are you so greedy today?

557
00:20:30,502 --> 00:20:31,731
You're going to eat a lot anyway.

558
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,432
- You don't want to play? - I do.

559
00:20:33,872 --> 00:20:35,902
(Of course I do.)

560
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:38,312
This meat...

561
00:20:39,172 --> 00:20:40,772
For you celebrities,

562
00:20:41,482 --> 00:20:44,582
some of my customers ordered these for you.

563
00:20:44,682 --> 00:20:46,052
- Gosh. - Thank you.

564
00:20:46,952 --> 00:20:50,282
Could you tell me where they're sitting?

565
00:20:50,652 --> 00:20:52,122
Over there?

566
00:20:52,252 --> 00:20:53,491
Why are you...

567
00:20:53,492 --> 00:20:55,022
I just...

568
00:20:55,192 --> 00:20:56,391
I just want to know.

569
00:20:56,392 --> 00:20:57,392
Seung Ho.

570
00:20:57,393 --> 00:20:58,431
Why are you taking a spoon with you?

571
00:20:58,432 --> 00:21:00,361
I look at my reflection from time to time.

572
00:21:00,362 --> 00:21:01,401
Okay.

573
00:21:01,402 --> 00:21:02,762
- I'll go and say hello. - Okay.

574
00:21:03,162 --> 00:21:06,501
(Searching customers he wants to thank)

575
00:21:06,502 --> 00:21:07,902
Where are they?

576
00:21:08,442 --> 00:21:11,612
Hello. Thank you very much.

577
00:21:11,712 --> 00:21:15,082
I have a request to make.

578
00:21:15,412 --> 00:21:17,811
May I beg you for one bite?

579
00:21:17,812 --> 00:21:18,851
(May I beg you for one bite?)

580
00:21:18,852 --> 00:21:19,911
Would that be okay?

581
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:21,721
- Of course. - Of course.

582
00:21:21,722 --> 00:21:23,221
(Yes!)

583
00:21:23,222 --> 00:21:25,051
Hurry, Sang Uk. Come back.

584
00:21:25,052 --> 00:21:26,992
- Let's do the quiz. - The quiz? Okay.

585
00:21:27,422 --> 00:21:29,192
- It's up to you. - Give us the quiz now.

586
00:21:29,362 --> 00:21:30,892
He left on his own.

587
00:21:31,392 --> 00:21:34,262
(A quiz for the freeloaders without Seung Ho)

588
00:21:35,102 --> 00:21:36,402
On Euljiro 2-ga,

589
00:21:36,732 --> 00:21:38,601
there was Dohwaseo, the cradle of art...

590
00:21:38,602 --> 00:21:40,102
during Joseon dynasty.

591
00:21:40,372 --> 00:21:42,241
- "Dohwaseo?" - Painters...

592
00:21:42,242 --> 00:21:45,112
working at Dohwaseo were called "hwawon."

593
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:47,211
- Hwawon? - When hiring hwawon,

594
00:21:47,212 --> 00:21:51,552
people were asked to draw flowers, landscape, portraits,

595
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:55,082
animals, and this during the practical exam.

596
00:21:55,852 --> 00:21:57,121
What is this?

597
00:21:57,122 --> 00:22:00,021
It's something they drew during the practical exam.

598
00:22:00,022 --> 00:22:01,121
- Landscape, - I got it.

599
00:22:01,122 --> 00:22:02,392
Portraits, animals.

600
00:22:03,022 --> 00:22:04,122
Buildings?

601
00:22:04,862 --> 00:22:05,932
Incorrect.

602
00:22:06,432 --> 00:22:08,302
Plants are included in the flowers.

603
00:22:09,132 --> 00:22:10,161
Animals.

604
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,572
- That must be it. - What?

605
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:13,531
- I see. - That's it.

606
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:14,571
- That's it. - Goodness.

607
00:22:14,572 --> 00:22:15,742
- Right. - Right.

608
00:22:17,542 --> 00:22:18,842
I got it. Food?

609
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,212
Incorrect.

610
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,812
Mode of transportation? Cars?

611
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:24,412
- I got it. Trees. - Trees?

612
00:22:24,652 --> 00:22:26,852
There were many trees back then.

613
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:28,352
Like pine trees.

614
00:22:29,122 --> 00:22:30,322
Can you be more detailed?

615
00:22:31,092 --> 00:22:33,251
- Is the answer pine trees? - Pine trees?

616
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:34,661
(Pine trees)

617
00:22:34,662 --> 00:22:35,692
Incorrect.

618
00:22:35,792 --> 00:22:37,492
The kimchi stew is disappearing.

619
00:22:37,662 --> 00:22:38,762
Gosh.

620
00:22:38,832 --> 00:22:40,832
- I got it. Cherry blossom tree? - Incorrect.

621
00:22:41,562 --> 00:22:42,802
There's no more meat.

622
00:22:43,202 --> 00:22:44,601
He might need to get ramyeon noodles.

623
00:22:44,602 --> 00:22:46,431
Stop eating. Leave me some.

624
00:22:46,432 --> 00:22:48,242
- I didn't serve meat. - Goodness.

625
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:50,302
Never mind.

626
00:22:51,612 --> 00:22:52,772
Hurry up.

627
00:22:53,572 --> 00:22:55,111
Why is your nose running?

628
00:22:55,112 --> 00:22:57,182
- What's the question? - Your mouth is red.

629
00:22:57,582 --> 00:23:02,251
(Information: Seung Ho definitely got some food.)

630
00:23:02,252 --> 00:23:03,321
Give us the question.

631
00:23:03,322 --> 00:23:05,621
It's a type of tree. You need to name the right one.

632
00:23:05,622 --> 00:23:07,092
We said everything including pine trees.

633
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:09,592
I got it. Sawtooth oak? Oak?

634
00:23:09,892 --> 00:23:11,562
- Japanese cypress? - Mulberry tree?

635
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:12,962
Incorrect.

636
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,132
That's strange. They named all the trees.

637
00:23:15,502 --> 00:23:16,562
I got it.

638
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:19,032
Yes, this is the only one that's left.

639
00:23:19,572 --> 00:23:21,272
I'm sorry, guys.

640
00:23:21,872 --> 00:23:23,501
- Bamboo. - Bamboo.

641
00:23:23,502 --> 00:23:24,671
(Answer: Bamboo)

642
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,712
Goodness.

643
00:23:26,242 --> 00:23:27,572
- No one brought it up. - No one said it.

644
00:23:27,912 --> 00:23:29,212
No one said that?

645
00:23:29,312 --> 00:23:30,312
- By the way... - The answer...

646
00:23:30,313 --> 00:23:31,852
Can I serve myself here?

647
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:33,611
There's a lot of tofu.

648
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:34,621
Tofu.

649
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,282
(He serves himself a piece of tofu.)

650
00:23:37,152 --> 00:23:39,251
Also, we said...

651
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:40,592
They finished the stew anyway.

652
00:23:40,852 --> 00:23:42,291
Dong Hyun took all the meat.

653
00:23:42,292 --> 00:23:43,721
No, there's some meat left.

654
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:45,031
Tae Hyun, try it with the broth.

655
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:46,431
I don't need to eat that.

656
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,761
I've been craving this tofu.

657
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:50,161
There's some left.

658
00:23:50,162 --> 00:23:52,332
Tae Hyun, if that's all you're eating...

659
00:23:53,102 --> 00:23:55,202
- Why did you get the right answer? - I'm sorry.

660
00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:56,442
Gosh.

661
00:23:56,642 --> 00:23:57,942
This is good for me.

662
00:23:58,342 --> 00:23:59,942
- Yes. - There's a lot of meat.

663
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,812
He wants to enjoy chicken gomtang even more.

664
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:06,812
(Why do I feel like I lost twice?)

665
00:24:07,452 --> 00:24:09,981
- Could you give us the bill? - Please pay for the other table.

666
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:11,391
Thank you. How much is it?

667
00:24:11,392 --> 00:24:12,521
Let's see.

668
00:24:12,522 --> 00:24:13,621
Wait a minute.

669
00:24:13,622 --> 00:24:15,662
(Why are there two bills?)

670
00:24:16,092 --> 00:24:17,392
Please enjoy your meal.

671
00:24:17,862 --> 00:24:20,862
We will pay for your food.

672
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:24,101
Just enjoy it without paying.

673
00:24:24,102 --> 00:24:25,201
Thank you.

674
00:24:25,202 --> 00:24:26,401
(Clapping)

675
00:24:26,402 --> 00:24:28,801
- Thank you. - Thank you.

676
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:29,842
Please be healthy.

677
00:24:30,442 --> 00:24:31,672
Since they gave us Coke,

678
00:24:31,872 --> 00:24:34,271
I told them that we'd pay for them.

679
00:24:34,272 --> 00:24:36,581
- Our bill is 58 dollars. - Our bill is 58 dollars.

680
00:24:36,582 --> 00:24:39,051
- Their bill is 98 dollars. - What have you done?

681
00:24:39,052 --> 00:24:40,082
- Hey. - Wait.

682
00:24:40,252 --> 00:24:42,022
Then we're paying for the beverages.

683
00:24:42,922 --> 00:24:44,392
- You're right. - You're right.

684
00:24:44,552 --> 00:24:45,852
Goodness.

685
00:24:45,922 --> 00:24:47,822
The total is more than what we ate.

686
00:24:48,122 --> 00:24:51,091
A moment ago, you said that you'd be happy to pay.

687
00:24:51,092 --> 00:24:53,662
It'd be a pleasure to tell them that I'm treating them.

688
00:24:53,832 --> 00:24:55,902
He had the pleasure to tell them, and I'm paying for it.

689
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,432
You might win.

690
00:24:58,872 --> 00:24:59,972
- Let's go. - Okay.

691
00:25:00,602 --> 00:25:05,141
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

692
00:25:05,142 --> 00:25:08,281
According to the survey, an average consumption of pork...

693
00:25:08,282 --> 00:25:10,742
per person was 30kg last year.

694
00:25:10,982 --> 00:25:14,281
This is about twice as much as chicken and beef.

695
00:25:14,282 --> 00:25:15,282
I see.

696
00:25:15,283 --> 00:25:19,422
Pork cuts such as pork neck, pork belly,

697
00:25:19,752 --> 00:25:22,022
pork shoulder with ham, and ribs.

698
00:25:22,092 --> 00:25:23,121
Wait.

699
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:25,761
Name these four cuts in order...

700
00:25:25,762 --> 00:25:27,592
- of Korean people's preference. - This is difficult.

701
00:25:27,936 --> 00:25:31,306
Pork cuts such as pork neck, pork belly,

702
00:25:31,576 --> 00:25:33,846
pork shoulder with ham, and ribs.

703
00:25:34,006 --> 00:25:35,015
Wait.

704
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:37,575
Name these four cuts in order...

705
00:25:37,576 --> 00:25:39,486
- of Korean people's preference. - This is difficult.

706
00:25:40,986 --> 00:25:42,415
- You know the first one, right? - Pork belly.

707
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,686
It's definitely pork belly.

708
00:25:43,916 --> 00:25:45,626
Next is 1 of the 3.

709
00:25:46,056 --> 00:25:47,155
It has to be ribs.

710
00:25:47,156 --> 00:25:49,096
- Or pork neck. - No, here's why.

711
00:25:49,556 --> 00:25:50,825
There's jokbal.

712
00:25:50,826 --> 00:25:52,565
That's why ribs...

713
00:25:52,566 --> 00:25:55,666
Surprisingly, people don't eat ribs unless they're grilled.

714
00:25:55,996 --> 00:25:56,996
My gosh.

715
00:25:58,006 --> 00:26:00,235
In my opinion, pork belly is obviously number one.

716
00:26:00,236 --> 00:26:01,635
- Pork belly is number one. - I thought...

717
00:26:01,636 --> 00:26:03,075
pork shoulder and ham would be last.

718
00:26:03,076 --> 00:26:06,175
So I thought the order was pork neck, ribs, shoulder and ham.

719
00:26:06,176 --> 00:26:07,176
I see.

720
00:26:07,177 --> 00:26:09,115
As you said, if most people eat jokbal...

721
00:26:09,116 --> 00:26:10,646
- People eat a lot of jokbal. - Right.

722
00:26:11,616 --> 00:26:13,545
I think you're right.

723
00:26:13,546 --> 00:26:16,085
Most people would think like me,

724
00:26:16,086 --> 00:26:17,186
so their answer is wrong.

725
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:18,485
It's too obvious.

726
00:26:18,486 --> 00:26:20,125
You'd think that it's pork neck after pork belly.

727
00:26:20,126 --> 00:26:23,156
Among grilled meat, pork ribs are consumed a lot.

728
00:26:23,426 --> 00:26:25,066
These days, people order a lot of food delivery.

729
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,295
That's why this question was given.

730
00:26:26,296 --> 00:26:27,365
- I agree. - Okay.

731
00:26:27,366 --> 00:26:30,995
Is jokbal the same as pork shoulder and ham?

732
00:26:30,996 --> 00:26:32,905
Yes, jokbal is made with pork shoulder and ham.

733
00:26:32,906 --> 00:26:33,935
Pork shoulder is more expensive.

734
00:26:33,936 --> 00:26:35,035
My family sold jokbal for 15 years.

735
00:26:35,036 --> 00:26:36,036
- Pork shoulder is expensive. - Right.

736
00:26:36,037 --> 00:26:38,446
- Jokbal sounds plausible. - My family sold jokbal, so I know.

737
00:26:38,776 --> 00:26:40,345
Pork belly, pork shoulder and ham.

738
00:26:40,346 --> 00:26:41,846
The remaining ones are pork neck and ribs.

739
00:26:42,176 --> 00:26:43,875
I think ribs are third,

740
00:26:43,876 --> 00:26:44,985
and pork neck is fourth.

741
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:46,086
Really?

742
00:26:46,386 --> 00:26:47,785
Not everyone likes pork neck.

743
00:26:47,786 --> 00:26:49,256
Your answer is totally unexpected.

744
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:52,125
Let's go with your answer. I think it can go either way,

745
00:26:52,126 --> 00:26:53,385
but you sound more reasonable.

746
00:26:53,386 --> 00:26:55,796
Write pork neck as third for now.

747
00:26:55,956 --> 00:26:58,425
I'm never insistent about my opinion...

748
00:26:58,426 --> 00:26:59,596
because I'm ambiguous.

749
00:26:59,766 --> 00:27:02,365
He's not insistent, but he whines a lot.

750
00:27:02,366 --> 00:27:04,235
I'm afraid that he'd blame me if I'm wrong.

751
00:27:04,236 --> 00:27:05,406
- No. - He definitely will.

752
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:07,506
He will whine and never let it go.

753
00:27:07,806 --> 00:27:09,335
(Laughing)

754
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:11,175
I think our first guess is right.

755
00:27:11,176 --> 00:27:12,176
- Our first guess? - Yes.

756
00:27:12,177 --> 00:27:13,205
Okay.

757
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:14,445
- Please. - Here's the answer.

758
00:27:14,446 --> 00:27:16,676
Pork belly, pork shoulder and ham,

759
00:27:16,846 --> 00:27:18,416
ribs, and pork neck.

760
00:27:18,816 --> 00:27:19,885
It'd be amazing if we're right.

761
00:27:19,886 --> 00:27:21,185
- How can we get all four right? - It could be unexpected.

762
00:27:21,186 --> 00:27:23,016
We got it because he's a meat expert.

763
00:27:24,016 --> 00:27:25,126
That's incorrect.

764
00:27:25,786 --> 00:27:27,126
- Oh, come on. - Goodness.

765
00:27:28,026 --> 00:27:29,195
Now, you should answer again.

766
00:27:29,196 --> 00:27:30,295
- It's pork neck. - What?

767
00:27:30,296 --> 00:27:32,926
One of you should get the right answer.

768
00:27:33,226 --> 00:27:35,035
- Hurry up. - I'll switch these two.

769
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:36,066
I got it.

770
00:27:36,496 --> 00:27:38,005
- Ribs. - Look at him.

771
00:27:38,006 --> 00:27:39,606
Pork shoulder and ham.

772
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:41,306
- Isn't it wrong to get it right? - Go ahead.

773
00:27:41,376 --> 00:27:42,405
- It's okay. Go ahead. - Is it okay?

774
00:27:42,406 --> 00:27:43,406
Yes.

775
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,146
- Go. - Pork belly,

776
00:27:45,606 --> 00:27:47,776
ribs, pork shoulder and ham, pork neck.

777
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:49,776
- Are you okay with yielding? - Yes.

778
00:27:50,176 --> 00:27:51,215
Incorrect.

779
00:27:51,216 --> 00:27:52,216
- All right. - I'll answer.

780
00:27:52,217 --> 00:27:53,316
- Pork belly. - Okay.

781
00:27:53,446 --> 00:27:54,555
- Pork neck. - Okay.

782
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:55,886
Ribs, pork shoulder and ham.

783
00:27:55,956 --> 00:27:57,216
You said that people don't eat pork neck.

784
00:27:57,316 --> 00:27:59,225
People might eat it a lot at a barbecue restaurant.

785
00:27:59,226 --> 00:28:00,485
He said that it was in second place.

786
00:28:00,486 --> 00:28:01,755
You said that you don't eat pork neck.

787
00:28:01,756 --> 00:28:03,825
- My goodness. - I was overthinking.

788
00:28:03,826 --> 00:28:04,826
- Gosh. - Correct.

789
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:06,126
Okay!

790
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,226
Yes!

791
00:28:07,696 --> 00:28:09,065
Why you...

792
00:28:09,066 --> 00:28:11,605
- Hey, you said... - He did it in one shot.

793
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,606
Nice.

794
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:13,966
- Darn it. - Well done.

795
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:17,106
You said that you don't eat pork neck.

796
00:28:17,676 --> 00:28:19,205
These days, many people eat pork neck...

797
00:28:19,206 --> 00:28:20,576
to avoid gaining weight.

798
00:28:21,076 --> 00:28:22,616
Unbelievable.

799
00:28:22,946 --> 00:28:24,685
My goodness.

800
00:28:24,686 --> 00:28:26,186
- Yes. - Do you want this?

801
00:28:26,346 --> 00:28:27,515
But...

802
00:28:27,516 --> 00:28:29,216
the total is 58.5 dollars.

803
00:28:29,356 --> 00:28:30,755
I should go and boast about it.

804
00:28:30,756 --> 00:28:32,026
- All right. - They already left.

805
00:28:32,126 --> 00:28:33,126
They left?

806
00:28:33,486 --> 00:28:35,326
(He's about to lose it.)

807
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,525
They'd be happy...

808
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:37,696
- when they see it on TV. - This was on me.

809
00:28:38,596 --> 00:28:40,766
I also paid for the beverages you bought us.

810
00:28:42,266 --> 00:28:44,236
- They just brought them. - Right.

811
00:28:44,296 --> 00:28:46,206
Besides, I only drink Coke Zero.

812
00:28:47,766 --> 00:28:49,776
Dong Hyun, thank you for the food.

813
00:28:50,536 --> 00:28:51,545
Yes.

814
00:28:51,546 --> 00:28:52,775
(Total: 156.5 dollars)

815
00:28:52,776 --> 00:28:53,876
I'll take the receipt.

816
00:28:54,106 --> 00:28:56,145
Spending 150 dollars for 2 people is a lot.

817
00:28:56,146 --> 00:28:57,475
I don't mind paying. It was so delicious.

818
00:28:57,476 --> 00:28:58,985
You're athletes, so you have to eat a lot.

819
00:28:58,986 --> 00:29:00,416
The food was really good.

820
00:29:00,916 --> 00:29:03,615
(Eulji-ro)

821
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:06,725
(They set off to the second LMR restaurant.)

822
00:29:06,726 --> 00:29:07,826
It's snowing again.

823
00:29:08,696 --> 00:29:10,296
It's really snowing like the weather forecast said.

824
00:29:10,896 --> 00:29:12,866
It's just fluttering.

825
00:29:13,966 --> 00:29:16,166
In Busan, it never snows.

826
00:29:17,096 --> 00:29:19,866
After quitting baseball, I see snow a lot.

827
00:29:20,736 --> 00:29:22,636
Now it's Sang Uk's time.

828
00:29:24,436 --> 00:29:27,006
Seriously, I'm confident about eating.

829
00:29:28,346 --> 00:29:29,375
Chicken gomtang.

830
00:29:29,376 --> 00:29:30,845
(They head to the chicken gomtang restaurant.)

831
00:29:30,846 --> 00:29:32,715
(Looking around)

832
00:29:32,716 --> 00:29:33,946
- Is this the place? - Here we go.

833
00:29:34,186 --> 00:29:35,485
- Are you sure? - No way.

834
00:29:35,486 --> 00:29:37,385
I can tell this place is the real deal.

835
00:29:37,386 --> 00:29:39,185
- This place... - Let's go.

836
00:29:39,186 --> 00:29:40,456
There's no way the food here isn't good.

837
00:29:40,956 --> 00:29:41,996
This place...

838
00:29:44,396 --> 00:29:48,236
(Eulji-ro, the district known for old establishments)

839
00:29:49,636 --> 00:29:51,735
(The second restaurant recommended for lunch...)

840
00:29:51,736 --> 00:29:53,906
(has been serving in Eulji-ro for about 60 years.)

841
00:29:54,366 --> 00:29:56,576
(In the small alleyway next to the main building)

842
00:29:57,176 --> 00:30:01,106
(What is now the annex used to be the main hall.)

843
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,076
(Two elderly ladies first opened its doors 57 years ago.)

844
00:30:04,746 --> 00:30:06,385
(Its appearance has changed...)

845
00:30:06,386 --> 00:30:08,016
(now that it has been passed down through 3 generations.)

846
00:30:08,716 --> 00:30:11,626
(Its unchanging taste keeps long-time regulars coming back.)

847
00:30:12,126 --> 00:30:14,896
(But it has now charmed the younger generation.)

848
00:30:15,456 --> 00:30:18,225
(The oldest chicken gomtang restaurant in Eulji-ro...)

849
00:30:18,226 --> 00:30:21,026
(that is still loved by many)

850
00:30:23,336 --> 00:30:28,235
(Lunch Menu Recommendation 2, Chicken gomtang)

851
00:30:28,236 --> 00:30:29,875
You can tell that the food will be great by how the place looks.

852
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:31,005
Gosh, the smell.

853
00:30:31,006 --> 00:30:32,345
- Hello. - Every place has been around...

854
00:30:32,346 --> 00:30:33,706
for at least 30 to 40 years.

855
00:30:34,006 --> 00:30:36,716
The place is only shabby because it's been around for so long.

856
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:38,746
- I love it. - That's fine.

857
00:30:39,186 --> 00:30:40,215
This is the Eulji-ro vibe.

858
00:30:40,216 --> 00:30:42,255
- Why is it called HwangPyong? - Beats me.

859
00:30:42,256 --> 00:30:43,985
One of the founders was from Hwanghae Province...

860
00:30:43,986 --> 00:30:45,685
while one was from Pyongyang.

861
00:30:45,686 --> 00:30:47,085
- Hence HwangPyong. - Is this chicken gomtang...

862
00:30:47,086 --> 00:30:48,455
a North Korean dish?

863
00:30:48,456 --> 00:30:49,695
That's right.

864
00:30:49,696 --> 00:30:51,195
(The restaurant serves North Korean style chicken gomtang.)

865
00:30:51,196 --> 00:30:52,396
I didn't know that.

866
00:30:53,066 --> 00:30:55,966
This place has been around for 57 years.

867
00:30:57,296 --> 00:30:58,466
Did you say 57?

868
00:30:58,806 --> 00:31:01,105
It's been almost 60 years. 57 years to be exact.

869
00:31:01,106 --> 00:31:02,276
- No way. - Right where you're sitting.

870
00:31:02,576 --> 00:31:04,505
- Then... - Yes?

871
00:31:04,506 --> 00:31:06,546
We'll have chicken gomtang.

872
00:31:06,576 --> 00:31:08,815
- Seasoned chicken salad. - Here's what we'll do.

873
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:10,615
- There are five of us here. - Right.

874
00:31:10,616 --> 00:31:13,716
Only the 3 of us will eat since these 2 already ate.

875
00:31:14,316 --> 00:31:15,585
We'll have three bowls of chicken gomtang...

876
00:31:15,586 --> 00:31:16,815
and a plate of seasoned chicken salad.

877
00:31:16,816 --> 00:31:18,486
- Thank you. That'll be all. - Sure.

878
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:21,856
I badly wanted the seasoned chicken salad.

879
00:31:22,226 --> 00:31:23,996
It's been around for 60 years.

880
00:31:24,596 --> 00:31:26,425
You weren't interested in this dish earlier.

881
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:28,395
Why does that seem to be changing?

882
00:31:28,396 --> 00:31:30,635
That's not it. I was just wondering how it might be.

883
00:31:30,636 --> 00:31:31,906
You don't get to eat this often.

884
00:31:32,066 --> 00:31:33,305
- That's true. - That fascinates me.

885
00:31:33,306 --> 00:31:34,536
Just observe, then.

886
00:31:34,636 --> 00:31:36,605
I'm allowed to want one bite.

887
00:31:36,606 --> 00:31:37,806
(I wouldn't mind a bite.)

888
00:31:38,076 --> 00:31:41,346
We only serve two side dishes including this radish kimchi.

889
00:31:42,446 --> 00:31:44,746
That's great. I love it.

890
00:31:45,286 --> 00:31:47,046
My mom makes this at home...

891
00:31:47,546 --> 00:31:48,756
when she cooks chicken gomtang.

892
00:31:49,086 --> 00:31:50,686
This isn't easy to make.

893
00:31:50,756 --> 00:31:53,385
- It's not like what others serve. - This?

894
00:31:53,386 --> 00:31:55,456
- Here. - Goodness. Can't we try this?

895
00:31:55,596 --> 00:31:57,455
- Of course not. - No?

896
00:31:57,456 --> 00:31:59,526
Did you let us eat anything earlier?

897
00:32:01,126 --> 00:32:03,435
This is insane. Check this out.

898
00:32:03,436 --> 00:32:04,465
(He's trying his best to get himself a bite.)

899
00:32:04,466 --> 00:32:06,465
Look. This was crushed this morning.

900
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,735
(He even fidgets with the crushed garlic...)

901
00:32:07,736 --> 00:32:09,006
(that is added to the soup.)

902
00:32:09,206 --> 00:32:10,305
You can have a spoonful of that.

903
00:32:10,306 --> 00:32:11,475
(That's something you can try.)

904
00:32:11,476 --> 00:32:12,506
Will you let me have some gomtang, then?

905
00:32:13,976 --> 00:32:15,045
Allow me.

906
00:32:15,046 --> 00:32:16,375
(Softly)

907
00:32:16,376 --> 00:32:17,745
He's speaking in a different tone.

908
00:32:17,746 --> 00:32:20,115
Here's your cutlery, Tae Hyun.

909
00:32:20,116 --> 00:32:21,585
- Thank you. - We'd get told off...

910
00:32:21,586 --> 00:32:23,055
if they didn't match.

911
00:32:23,056 --> 00:32:24,256
(He makes sure that the chopsticks match.)

912
00:32:25,126 --> 00:32:26,726
- Thank you. - You must be hungry.

913
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:28,056
I'm starving.

914
00:32:30,126 --> 00:32:31,825
- That was fast. - Here's your gomtang.

915
00:32:31,826 --> 00:32:33,325
The food is served really fast.

916
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,895
We serve our food fast.

917
00:32:34,896 --> 00:32:36,165
The soup is always at a boil.

918
00:32:36,166 --> 00:32:37,295
(However...)

919
00:32:37,296 --> 00:32:39,135
Wait. Those aren't for them.

920
00:32:39,136 --> 00:32:40,205
(The soup was naturally served to the two big guys.)

921
00:32:40,206 --> 00:32:43,035
You must look like the ones who are here to eat.

922
00:32:43,036 --> 00:32:44,076
Those aren't yours.

923
00:32:44,436 --> 00:32:47,805
Sang Uk, it's time to show them what you're made of.

924
00:32:47,806 --> 00:32:49,245
(The chicken gomtang is only for Tae Hyun, Seung Ho, and Sang Uk.)

925
00:32:49,246 --> 00:32:50,446
All I'm going to do is eat.

926
00:32:52,786 --> 00:32:53,945
- Take this salt, - Yes?

927
00:32:53,946 --> 00:32:55,916
- and add a teaspoon of it. - I see.

928
00:32:56,056 --> 00:32:58,786
- Also, add a teaspoon of garlic. - Right.

929
00:32:59,026 --> 00:33:01,855
If you like it with chili flakes, add this as well.

930
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:05,395
- However, I personally like... - It's better without it.

931
00:33:05,396 --> 00:33:06,795
- For now. - Don't forget the pepper.

932
00:33:06,796 --> 00:33:08,535
- I see. Got it. - I'm curious.

933
00:33:08,536 --> 00:33:12,306
(Tae Hyun goes for the basics. Salt, crushed garlic, and pepper)

934
00:33:14,636 --> 00:33:16,736
- I have to ask. - Sure.

935
00:33:16,806 --> 00:33:18,805
How is this different from samgyetang?

936
00:33:18,806 --> 00:33:20,645
- It's nothing like samgyetang. - How so?

937
00:33:20,646 --> 00:33:22,975
Samgyetang is made with young chicken.

938
00:33:22,976 --> 00:33:25,786
Meanwhile, this is made with older chicken.

939
00:33:27,386 --> 00:33:31,386
(Broth from older chicken is cooked for more than 3 hours a day.)

940
00:33:31,986 --> 00:33:36,826
(Chicken skin and breast meat are added to the broth.)

941
00:33:41,566 --> 00:33:44,065
(Everything is soaked in the broth several times...)

942
00:33:44,066 --> 00:33:46,536
(before being served as chicken gomtang.)

943
00:33:48,436 --> 00:33:50,636
- So that's how it's different. - It has a lot of meat.

944
00:33:51,336 --> 00:33:53,106
- We use older chicken. - This looks amazing.

945
00:33:53,146 --> 00:33:54,746
- It's older chicken. - We'll enjoy it.

946
00:33:54,806 --> 00:33:55,975
- Check out the skin. - We'll enjoy it.

947
00:33:55,976 --> 00:33:58,416
(Team Chicken Gomtang finally has lunch.)

948
00:34:00,416 --> 00:34:02,585
- The broth is clear. - Look at you setting the dishes.

949
00:34:02,586 --> 00:34:04,756
(They waited long enough. How is it?)

950
00:34:04,816 --> 00:34:05,956
(My gosh!)

951
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,226
- Is it different? - It is.

952
00:34:07,426 --> 00:34:09,256
- It's mild. - Right.

953
00:34:09,796 --> 00:34:11,556
I haven't added anything to it yet.

954
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:13,426
I'll try it as is.

955
00:34:13,796 --> 00:34:15,135
- It'll still be good. - That's good.

956
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:16,296
It's nice.

957
00:34:18,866 --> 00:34:19,906
This is great.

958
00:34:21,136 --> 00:34:24,005
(Sang Uk finally tastes it.)

959
00:34:24,006 --> 00:34:25,576
- It's mild. - Right.

960
00:34:26,576 --> 00:34:27,706
- It'll still be good. - That's good.

961
00:34:28,876 --> 00:34:30,316
It's about time I ate something.

962
00:34:31,316 --> 00:34:32,716
- You should fill yourself up. - My gosh.

963
00:34:34,146 --> 00:34:35,655
(Sang Uk forgets about his days of hunger...)

964
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,156
(and enjoys his dish.)

965
00:34:37,956 --> 00:34:38,956
(He has a huge spoonful with a pickle.)

966
00:34:38,957 --> 00:34:40,486
It'd be nice with some cucumber.

967
00:34:41,386 --> 00:34:43,955
(Sang Uk even tries the chicken skin.)

968
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,065
(Yummy)

969
00:34:45,066 --> 00:34:47,525
- They even serve chicken skin. - Right.

970
00:34:47,526 --> 00:34:48,536
(Chicken skin is served with the hearty chicken gomtang.)

971
00:34:49,296 --> 00:34:51,966
(The chicken was boiled for hours, so the skin is like jelly.)

972
00:34:52,206 --> 00:34:54,366
- The skin is to die for. - No way.

973
00:34:54,736 --> 00:34:55,836
I love chicken skin.

974
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:57,475
I haven't seen this before.

975
00:34:57,476 --> 00:34:58,776
I see that's served as well.

976
00:34:58,876 --> 00:34:59,876
Here we go.

977
00:34:59,877 --> 00:35:01,276
(Seung Ho will add the rice and properly enjoy the dish.)

978
00:35:02,476 --> 00:35:03,715
(A big mouthful)

979
00:35:03,716 --> 00:35:06,616
(Diving into his mouth)

980
00:35:08,686 --> 00:35:09,816
- It's really good. - Here.

981
00:35:10,956 --> 00:35:13,486
Even when we stepped foot in here, I didn't want any.

982
00:35:14,426 --> 00:35:15,526
- Right? - Yes.

983
00:35:15,896 --> 00:35:17,626
But looking at it makes me hungry.

984
00:35:18,296 --> 00:35:20,895
It's the same with athletes like us.

985
00:35:20,896 --> 00:35:22,295
Our muscles respond to nutritious food.

986
00:35:22,296 --> 00:35:23,666
I know I should eat this for my muscles.

987
00:35:23,796 --> 00:35:25,765
I'm fine. My stomach's full.

988
00:35:25,766 --> 00:35:28,235
But my muscles are telling me to eat this.

989
00:35:28,236 --> 00:35:30,236
- This is what you'd love. - Right?

990
00:35:30,536 --> 00:35:33,376
- Seasoned chicken salad. - Here's the seasoned chicken salad.

991
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:35,516
- I've never seen this before. - Likewise.

992
00:35:36,916 --> 00:35:38,545
- This is a first. - Do we just eat this?

993
00:35:38,546 --> 00:35:39,615
- How... - Go ahead.

994
00:35:39,616 --> 00:35:41,015
I've never seen seasoned chicken salad before.

995
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:43,285
Of course. You won't find this anywhere else.

996
00:35:43,286 --> 00:35:44,715
Look at the shredded chicken.

997
00:35:44,716 --> 00:35:47,155
Sweet and sour. It's like whelk salad.

998
00:35:47,156 --> 00:35:48,826
(Your chopsticks immediately respond to the dish.)

999
00:35:49,556 --> 00:35:51,425
- Sweet and sour. - Cucumber salad.

1000
00:35:51,426 --> 00:35:53,165
- This reminds me... - No way.

1001
00:35:53,166 --> 00:35:54,596
Of a nice cucumber salad.

1002
00:35:54,866 --> 00:35:56,235
(They respond immediately after tasting it.)

1003
00:35:56,236 --> 00:35:57,565
It smells like cucumber salad.

1004
00:35:57,566 --> 00:35:58,836
(His eyes widened.)

1005
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,135
And chicken skin.

1006
00:36:01,136 --> 00:36:03,676
- Is this sold anywhere else? - This is a first for me.

1007
00:36:04,306 --> 00:36:05,306
Exactly. This...

1008
00:36:05,406 --> 00:36:07,876
(Stealing his gaze)

1009
00:36:09,946 --> 00:36:13,216
It reminds me of a cold jokbal salad.

1010
00:36:14,086 --> 00:36:15,785
- It's sweet. - It's on the sour side.

1011
00:36:15,786 --> 00:36:17,516
- It's sweet and sour. - Right.

1012
00:36:17,816 --> 00:36:18,856
Enjoy.

1013
00:36:19,426 --> 00:36:20,486
- Thank you. - No problem.

1014
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:23,556
I'm fooling my brain making it think that I ate it.

1015
00:36:25,026 --> 00:36:26,296
I was wondering what he was up to.

1016
00:36:27,596 --> 00:36:28,596
(Pretending to eat as an attempt to fool his brain)

1017
00:36:28,597 --> 00:36:30,396
- This is good. - This is unexpected.

1018
00:36:31,036 --> 00:36:33,136
I haven't had this before, which is why I'm curious.

1019
00:36:33,766 --> 00:36:35,976
What on earth is this? I haven't had this before.

1020
00:36:36,136 --> 00:36:37,636
I haven't seen anything like this before.

1021
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,105
To be honest, I thought...

1022
00:36:41,106 --> 00:36:42,345
the kimchi stew was the ultimate dish.

1023
00:36:42,346 --> 00:36:44,445
I didn't think I'd be wanting this.

1024
00:36:44,446 --> 00:36:46,416
However, this is totally different.

1025
00:36:47,746 --> 00:36:49,056
It's a different kind.

1026
00:36:51,356 --> 00:36:53,156
It must've been tough to watch us eat kimchi stew.

1027
00:36:53,456 --> 00:36:55,055
You have no idea.

1028
00:36:55,056 --> 00:36:57,525
- We were on an empty stomach. - It was excruciating.

1029
00:36:57,526 --> 00:36:59,825
- It's hard even though we ate. - Exactly.

1030
00:36:59,826 --> 00:37:01,496
You know how Sang Uk loves to eat.

1031
00:37:01,896 --> 00:37:03,065
It must've been tough.

1032
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:04,496
(You know how Sang Uk loves to eat.)

1033
00:37:05,506 --> 00:37:06,665
Why don't they make this anywhere else?

1034
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:08,606
(Just about 1 hour ago...)

1035
00:37:09,806 --> 00:37:14,076
(The two teams are in each other's shoes now.)

1036
00:37:14,846 --> 00:37:17,546
(Seung Ho was annoyed with how much they enjoyed it.)

1037
00:37:17,916 --> 00:37:19,916
Let me tell you how this is.

1038
00:37:20,916 --> 00:37:22,716
(The tables have turned.)

1039
00:37:23,256 --> 00:37:25,956
(Listen to how upset I was.)

1040
00:37:27,326 --> 00:37:30,156
(They couldn't do anything but watch them eat lettuce wraps.)

1041
00:37:30,926 --> 00:37:35,196
(Look at us enjoying the seasoned chicken salad.)

1042
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,605
- I'm glad I endured it. - I know.

1043
00:37:38,606 --> 00:37:40,935
- I'm proud of myself. - This is so good.

1044
00:37:40,936 --> 00:37:42,576
- Is there more? - Yes, of course.

1045
00:37:43,106 --> 00:37:44,175
Give us our quiz.

1046
00:37:44,176 --> 00:37:45,546
- Sorry? - For a bite of this.

1047
00:37:45,706 --> 00:37:48,275
- Cucumber, onion, - I'd love a bite of that.

1048
00:37:48,276 --> 00:37:49,515
And chicken breast.

1049
00:37:49,516 --> 00:37:51,046
The triple delight.

1050
00:37:51,216 --> 00:37:52,216
Do we get a question?

1051
00:37:52,546 --> 00:37:53,546
A bit later.

1052
00:37:55,786 --> 00:37:58,015
- Why? - I could ask you the same thing.

1053
00:37:58,016 --> 00:37:59,126
(Why, you ask?)

1054
00:37:59,326 --> 00:38:00,385
Whoever gets it right...

1055
00:38:00,386 --> 00:38:02,655
Come on. Aren't we all friends?

1056
00:38:02,656 --> 00:38:03,795
Get it right, and that'll make us friends.

1057
00:38:03,796 --> 00:38:06,126
Tae Hyun, you're enjoying this way too much. Calm down a bit.

1058
00:38:06,226 --> 00:38:07,766
That was brutally annoying.

1059
00:38:08,066 --> 00:38:09,735
(An hour ago)

1060
00:38:09,736 --> 00:38:10,965
(Maybe a little later)

1061
00:38:10,966 --> 00:38:12,866
(You did the same thing to them!)

1062
00:38:13,736 --> 00:38:16,735
(You were even more irritating.)

1063
00:38:16,736 --> 00:38:17,936
I don't remember any of that.

1064
00:38:18,136 --> 00:38:20,506
I'm sorry. I apologize. But I don't remember.

1065
00:38:21,106 --> 00:38:23,175
How is it? I bet it's nice and chewy.

1066
00:38:23,176 --> 00:38:25,185
(He still can't take his eyes off the seasoned chicken salad.)

1067
00:38:25,186 --> 00:38:28,245
- That looks really good. - There's more here.

1068
00:38:28,246 --> 00:38:29,316
(The 3 aren't thinking about sharing any yet.)

1069
00:38:30,156 --> 00:38:31,585
Gosh, the chicken skin.

1070
00:38:31,586 --> 00:38:33,726
One of you won't get to taste this.

1071
00:38:34,086 --> 00:38:36,026
I want it more because it's been prohibited.

1072
00:38:37,956 --> 00:38:39,725
Even since I started earning money after turning 20,

1073
00:38:39,726 --> 00:38:41,196
I told myself never to let food become my weakness.

1074
00:38:41,726 --> 00:38:43,565
I told myself to treat myself to whatever I wanted.

1075
00:38:43,566 --> 00:38:45,236
- But now this is here... - But this?

1076
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:47,135
(We can't hear you.)

1077
00:38:47,136 --> 00:38:48,635
There's a lot of meat in the soup.

1078
00:38:48,636 --> 00:38:50,136
I don't want it.

1079
00:38:50,636 --> 00:38:53,376
What on earth are you doing, Dae Ho?

1080
00:38:53,806 --> 00:38:55,275
Please give us a quiz already.

1081
00:38:55,276 --> 00:38:56,415
We've waited long enough.

1082
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:58,416
- Okay. - The one who gets it right...

1083
00:38:58,686 --> 00:39:00,346
can have the salad and anything else.

1084
00:39:00,746 --> 00:39:03,015
- Here's your question. - I think I'll get this one.

1085
00:39:03,016 --> 00:39:04,156
(A quiz for the freeloaders)

1086
00:39:04,456 --> 00:39:07,886
On January 28, 1989, a news article was published...

1087
00:39:07,986 --> 00:39:10,356
with a headline that read,

1088
00:39:10,756 --> 00:39:13,596
"A profession that has made waves in Hungary."

1089
00:39:13,626 --> 00:39:15,095
"The fast hands of Koreans shock everyone."

1090
00:39:15,096 --> 00:39:18,265
- In 1989. - What profession allowed...

1091
00:39:18,266 --> 00:39:21,975
many of our people to generate foreign income...

1092
00:39:21,976 --> 00:39:23,636
between the 60s and 80s?

1093
00:39:24,676 --> 00:39:25,705
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

1094
00:39:25,706 --> 00:39:26,946
- Go ahead. - They both raised their hand.

1095
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:30,957
On January 28, 1989, a news article was published...

1096
00:39:30,958 --> 00:39:33,458
with a headline that read,

1097
00:39:33,658 --> 00:39:35,627
"A profession that has made waves in Hungary."

1098
00:39:35,628 --> 00:39:36,667
"The fast hands of Koreans..."

1099
00:39:36,668 --> 00:39:38,827
- "shock everyone." - It was 1989.

1100
00:39:38,828 --> 00:39:42,608
What profession allowed...

1101
00:39:42,638 --> 00:39:45,007
many of our people to generate foreign income...

1102
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:46,908
between the 60s and 80s?

1103
00:39:47,638 --> 00:39:48,777
- Let me answer. - Let me answer.

1104
00:39:48,778 --> 00:39:49,848
- Go ahead. - They both raised their hand.

1105
00:39:49,948 --> 00:39:51,607
No, Dae Ho was a bit faster.

1106
00:39:51,608 --> 00:39:54,377
What do you mean? We raised our hands simultaneously.

1107
00:39:54,378 --> 00:39:55,447
I'll let him do it.

1108
00:39:55,448 --> 00:39:56,618
- I think... - Yes.

1109
00:39:57,448 --> 00:39:59,558
- A miner. - A miner.

1110
00:39:59,618 --> 00:40:00,817
- What about you, Dong Hyun? - Me?

1111
00:40:00,818 --> 00:40:02,428
- A nurse. - A nurse.

1112
00:40:03,888 --> 00:40:05,598
- A miner and a nurse. - I think so.

1113
00:40:06,258 --> 00:40:10,527
(Who will be the winner of the quiz for the freeloaders?)

1114
00:40:10,528 --> 00:40:11,728
Both of you are incorrect.

1115
00:40:12,098 --> 00:40:13,768
Hungary is famous for fencing.

1116
00:40:14,068 --> 00:40:15,497
I think the answer is a fencer.

1117
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:17,937
It has nothing to do with fencing. Seriously.

1118
00:40:17,938 --> 00:40:18,938
- Go for it. - Say it.

1119
00:40:18,939 --> 00:40:20,338
I'll try it. A fencer.

1120
00:40:21,178 --> 00:40:22,477
- Okay. - An athlete?

1121
00:40:22,478 --> 00:40:23,547
Taekwondo!

1122
00:40:23,548 --> 00:40:25,407
- Say, "I got it," first. - Okay.

1123
00:40:25,408 --> 00:40:26,678
(Okay.)

1124
00:40:26,878 --> 00:40:27,878
- I got it. - I got it.

1125
00:40:28,578 --> 00:40:29,747
A sewing person.

1126
00:40:29,748 --> 00:40:31,248
- A seamstress? - Yes. A seamstress.

1127
00:40:31,588 --> 00:40:32,988
- Incorrect. - Gosh. What is it?

1128
00:40:33,918 --> 00:40:35,018
- I got it. - Okay.

1129
00:40:35,088 --> 00:40:36,258
A person who sticks eyes on a doll.

1130
00:40:36,558 --> 00:40:38,027
(Laughing)

1131
00:40:38,028 --> 00:40:39,258
The one who seasons the grilled mackerel.

1132
00:40:39,398 --> 00:40:41,257
(He's about to mention every job that requires fast hands.)

1133
00:40:41,258 --> 00:40:42,427
- Incorrect. - That's not it?

1134
00:40:42,428 --> 00:40:43,698
(Everything was incorrect.)

1135
00:40:44,298 --> 00:40:46,598
How would I know when I was 7 in 1989?

1136
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:49,368
Here's a hint. Eggs.

1137
00:40:49,868 --> 00:40:52,678
- Eggs. - Many were sent to do that job.

1138
00:40:52,838 --> 00:40:53,978
- Eggs? - Eggs?

1139
00:40:54,338 --> 00:40:55,648
I got it. An egg sorting person.

1140
00:40:56,248 --> 00:40:57,608
- "Sorting." - Yes.

1141
00:40:58,108 --> 00:40:59,217
They sorted them by size.

1142
00:40:59,218 --> 00:41:00,748
- Incorrect. - It must be similar to that..

1143
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:02,987
Sorting eggs.

1144
00:41:02,988 --> 00:41:04,087
- I got it. - Yes.

1145
00:41:04,088 --> 00:41:05,117
(Saying his answer after thinking hard)

1146
00:41:05,118 --> 00:41:07,717
The chickens... The hens and the roosters.

1147
00:41:07,718 --> 00:41:08,787
What do you call it?

1148
00:41:08,788 --> 00:41:11,087
- "What do you call it?" - What was the name?

1149
00:41:11,088 --> 00:41:13,757
The one who distinguishes the female and male chickens.

1150
00:41:13,758 --> 00:41:15,397
Did they distinguish the sex of chickens?

1151
00:41:15,398 --> 00:41:16,568
That sorter.

1152
00:41:17,128 --> 00:41:18,798
(Is there such a profession?)

1153
00:41:18,968 --> 00:41:20,467
We'll say that's correct.

1154
00:41:20,468 --> 00:41:22,037
- What is it? - What is the exact answer?

1155
00:41:22,038 --> 00:41:24,507
- The profession was a chick sexer. - Right.

1156
00:41:24,508 --> 00:41:25,907
It's a chick, not chicken.

1157
00:41:25,908 --> 00:41:27,408
They distinguished the sex of the chicks.

1158
00:41:27,978 --> 00:41:29,207
- Awesome. - You got it right.

1159
00:41:29,208 --> 00:41:31,678
(Dae Ho got the chick sexer right.)

1160
00:41:31,978 --> 00:41:34,078
(The job was featured in "Minari" too.)

1161
00:41:34,178 --> 00:41:37,318
(A chick sexer who distinguishes the sex of the chicks)

1162
00:41:37,918 --> 00:41:38,988
Sorry, Dong Hyun.

1163
00:41:39,318 --> 00:41:40,857
Dae Ho's good.

1164
00:41:40,858 --> 00:41:42,588
- What are you going to do? - He does well by himself.

1165
00:41:43,558 --> 00:41:45,728
He's good at individual matches, not team matches.

1166
00:41:45,928 --> 00:41:47,458
He keeps hitting a home run by himself.

1167
00:41:48,728 --> 00:41:50,898
- I really wanted to try it. - Sang Uk too.

1168
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:53,467
I wouldn't have gotten the answer until the end.

1169
00:41:53,468 --> 00:41:54,498
Drink the soup.

1170
00:41:54,838 --> 00:41:56,938
I got it. Gosh.

1171
00:41:57,338 --> 00:41:58,667
He gets on my nerves too.

1172
00:41:58,668 --> 00:42:00,238
(Speaking what he thinks inside)

1173
00:42:00,538 --> 00:42:04,008
(Cheeky Dae Ho drinks up the chicken gomtang too.)

1174
00:42:04,508 --> 00:42:06,347
Gosh. Look at the garlic. There's a lot of it.

1175
00:42:06,348 --> 00:42:07,678
(It's chicken gomtang broth with garlic and salt this time.)

1176
00:42:08,418 --> 00:42:09,687
(He drinks it too.)

1177
00:42:09,688 --> 00:42:10,988
Isn't it so refreshing?

1178
00:42:11,418 --> 00:42:12,487
Good.

1179
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:13,718
(Grabbing)

1180
00:42:14,288 --> 00:42:15,827
(Bringing the seasoned chicken salad close to him)

1181
00:42:15,828 --> 00:42:17,058
He put it in front of him.

1182
00:42:17,188 --> 00:42:19,257
The skin of the chicken is so tasty.

1183
00:42:19,258 --> 00:42:20,397
- Gosh. What is this? - You have to have it.

1184
00:42:20,398 --> 00:42:21,528
The skin is tasty.

1185
00:42:21,698 --> 00:42:24,827
I'll put the chicken breast in the middle.

1186
00:42:24,828 --> 00:42:26,137
(He even makes a wrap with the chicken skin.)

1187
00:42:26,138 --> 00:42:27,597
(Staring)

1188
00:42:27,598 --> 00:42:29,138
It must have been tough for Sang Uk back then.

1189
00:42:29,968 --> 00:42:32,007
I'm sorry, Sang Uk. I should have known.

1190
00:42:32,008 --> 00:42:33,308
This is the three combo.

1191
00:42:34,078 --> 00:42:35,777
(It doesn't matter what happened to Sang Uk.)

1192
00:42:35,778 --> 00:42:37,448
(I'll have my seasoned chicken salad.)

1193
00:42:37,678 --> 00:42:39,347
(Disappointed)

1194
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:42,017
Why is the skin tasty? It's supposed to be greasy.

1195
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:43,547
The texture of it...

1196
00:42:43,548 --> 00:42:45,647
- Usually, it's soft, right? - It's soft.

1197
00:42:45,648 --> 00:42:47,658
- But this one is chewy. - It's so different.

1198
00:42:48,018 --> 00:42:49,188
It's chewy.

1199
00:42:49,828 --> 00:42:51,028
You have to have it together.

1200
00:42:51,188 --> 00:42:52,288
It's so chewy.

1201
00:42:54,558 --> 00:42:57,267
Ever since the format of the show has changed last week,

1202
00:42:57,268 --> 00:42:58,998
I feel like we've grown apart.

1203
00:42:59,468 --> 00:43:02,198
Honestly, I can pay and have this.

1204
00:43:02,298 --> 00:43:04,737
They are becoming cheekier.

1205
00:43:04,738 --> 00:43:07,007
- You are highly responsible for it. - Come on.

1206
00:43:07,008 --> 00:43:08,678
You're at the start and the end of it.

1207
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:10,807
Also, it's 2 versus 3, right?

1208
00:43:10,808 --> 00:43:12,818
But it feels like it's 4 versus 1.

1209
00:43:12,848 --> 00:43:14,747
- We call that karma. - Gosh.

1210
00:43:14,748 --> 00:43:16,687
- You have to try it later. - I said I got it.

1211
00:43:16,688 --> 00:43:17,847
- I got it. - Buy it and try it later.

1212
00:43:17,848 --> 00:43:19,818
I'm sorry but I'll have this one.

1213
00:43:21,958 --> 00:43:23,428
- I'm so happy. - At this point, if...

1214
00:43:23,528 --> 00:43:24,587
I enjoyed it so much.

1215
00:43:24,588 --> 00:43:27,458
You said you didn't have the grit that you can just pay for it.

1216
00:43:27,498 --> 00:43:29,798
But you love the quiz so much and solve it so passionately.

1217
00:43:29,828 --> 00:43:31,697
If they get the quiz right,

1218
00:43:31,698 --> 00:43:33,298
- we have to pay for it. - I know.

1219
00:43:33,668 --> 00:43:36,337
- You said you had no grit... - Then we'll have a match.

1220
00:43:36,338 --> 00:43:37,638
I already paid for it once.

1221
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:40,977
Dae Ho already thinks he has won.

1222
00:43:40,978 --> 00:43:42,507
- He's won already. - Listen.

1223
00:43:42,508 --> 00:43:44,007
- You think you can beat me easily? - Because he won once already.

1224
00:43:44,008 --> 00:43:45,108
I think I can beat you easily.

1225
00:43:45,178 --> 00:43:46,518
- Gosh. - Come on.

1226
00:43:46,878 --> 00:43:50,847
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

1227
00:43:50,848 --> 00:43:53,658
According to "Dongguksesigi," a book on seasonal customs...

1228
00:43:53,758 --> 00:43:55,958
during the Joseon Dynasty,

1229
00:43:56,058 --> 00:43:57,228
It's a hard one.

1230
00:43:57,328 --> 00:43:59,458
Our ancestors put on the drawings...

1231
00:43:59,498 --> 00:44:03,197
of a tiger or a chicken on the door at the beginning of January.

1232
00:44:03,198 --> 00:44:04,727
They put up a tiger drawing...

1233
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:08,237
in hopes of beating the bad energy with its bravery.

1234
00:44:08,238 --> 00:44:11,268
And they put up the chicken drawing for this reason.

1235
00:44:11,338 --> 00:44:12,878
What is this reason?

1236
00:44:12,908 --> 00:44:14,807
- Bravery. - Gosh.

1237
00:44:14,808 --> 00:44:16,077
- I think I know the answer. - What?

1238
00:44:16,078 --> 00:44:17,348
- Do you know it? - I think I got it.

1239
00:44:17,548 --> 00:44:18,647
It was for bravery and what?

1240
00:44:18,648 --> 00:44:19,978
I think I read it in Aesop's Fables.

1241
00:44:20,178 --> 00:44:22,077
- For what reasons... - It was a chicken seller.

1242
00:44:22,078 --> 00:44:23,818
Did they draw a chicken on the wall?

1243
00:44:23,948 --> 00:44:25,288
Does a chicken drive something out?

1244
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:28,258
- What does a chicken drive out? - What?

1245
00:44:28,488 --> 00:44:29,627
As for a chicken,

1246
00:44:29,628 --> 00:44:31,358
since it was a long time ago,

1247
00:44:32,158 --> 00:44:33,827
in case a predatory animal comes,

1248
00:44:33,828 --> 00:44:35,898
they put a chicken drawing as a prey.

1249
00:44:36,368 --> 00:44:37,568
Then the beasts would come.

1250
00:44:38,328 --> 00:44:39,467
I mean...

1251
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,668
it was so that they wouldn't come into the house.

1252
00:44:41,368 --> 00:44:43,407
- "Don't come into the house." - Which one?

1253
00:44:43,408 --> 00:44:44,408
This would be...

1254
00:44:44,409 --> 00:44:45,878
for germs and so.

1255
00:44:45,978 --> 00:44:48,377
Things that would make them sick.

1256
00:44:48,378 --> 00:44:49,678
They wanted to drive such things out.

1257
00:44:50,078 --> 00:44:51,247
- A chicken... - For good health?

1258
00:44:51,248 --> 00:44:53,077
A chicken wouldn't symbolize longevity, would it?

1259
00:44:53,078 --> 00:44:54,317
They live a long life, Tae Hyun.

1260
00:44:54,318 --> 00:44:56,588
They live more than 15 years.

1261
00:44:56,618 --> 00:44:57,647
- Really? - Yes.

1262
00:44:57,648 --> 00:45:00,018
Anyway, I'm writing everything down.

1263
00:45:00,058 --> 00:45:01,717
- We eat it for our health. - The chicken blood.

1264
00:45:01,718 --> 00:45:03,957
We use chicken blood to drive the ghosts away.

1265
00:45:03,958 --> 00:45:05,588
- An evil spirit? - Exactly.

1266
00:45:05,628 --> 00:45:06,857
- The chicken blood. - I know.

1267
00:45:06,858 --> 00:45:08,127
- You know how they use it, right? - To drive the evil spirits away?

1268
00:45:08,128 --> 00:45:09,398
- They use chicken blood for it. - Then this is the answer.

1269
00:45:10,028 --> 00:45:11,767
(Answer: They believed the crowing...)

1270
00:45:11,768 --> 00:45:13,238
(at dawn drove the ghosts out.)

1271
00:45:13,538 --> 00:45:15,098
It was chicken of all things.

1272
00:45:15,498 --> 00:45:17,707
- If it were a drawing of it, - Or...

1273
00:45:17,708 --> 00:45:20,137
it was because it was diligent. To be diligent in the morning.

1274
00:45:20,138 --> 00:45:22,207
(Dong Hyun, calm down.)

1275
00:45:22,208 --> 00:45:23,208
To be diligent?

1276
00:45:23,209 --> 00:45:25,707
If they put it up on the house,

1277
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:28,617
it was to prevent illnesses...

1278
00:45:28,618 --> 00:45:29,687
or evil spirits.

1279
00:45:29,688 --> 00:45:31,847
But would they put such a thing on the house for evil spirits?

1280
00:45:31,848 --> 00:45:33,287
- Or... - Isn't that going too far?

1281
00:45:33,288 --> 00:45:35,717
They lay many eggs, so it was to wish for childbirths.

1282
00:45:35,718 --> 00:45:36,987
Wishing for fecundity.

1283
00:45:36,988 --> 00:45:38,987
- Back then, they wanted sons. - For fecundity?

1284
00:45:38,988 --> 00:45:41,757
If it's correct, you've helped us. Why are you doing this?

1285
00:45:41,758 --> 00:45:43,967
- I don't know the answer. - Exactly.

1286
00:45:43,968 --> 00:45:45,327
When you're considering something, I give you lots of other options...

1287
00:45:45,328 --> 00:45:46,737
- to confuse you. - To confuse you.

1288
00:45:46,738 --> 00:45:48,597
If there are 2 options, you have a 50 percent chance.

1289
00:45:48,598 --> 00:45:50,238
If there are 3, it's a 33 percent chance.

1290
00:45:50,268 --> 00:45:51,537
- For 4, it's 25 percent. - Good.

1291
00:45:51,538 --> 00:45:53,108
- He gives you plausible answers. - For fecundity. For childbirths.

1292
00:45:53,338 --> 00:45:56,077
Was it really to wish for longevity and fecundity?

1293
00:45:56,078 --> 00:45:58,947
When he mentioned the eggs, I'm so persuaded by the fecundity.

1294
00:45:58,948 --> 00:46:00,478
Because you have many kids.

1295
00:46:00,848 --> 00:46:03,017
- I just threw the answer at you. - Think about it.

1296
00:46:03,018 --> 00:46:05,747
The chicken keeps laying the eggs.

1297
00:46:05,748 --> 00:46:08,087
- Dong Hyun, we're not going to pay. - No, we aren't.

1298
00:46:08,088 --> 00:46:09,557
Here's the problem.

1299
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:12,797
They put it up at the beginning of January.

1300
00:46:12,798 --> 00:46:14,458
- What do we call that? - Is it this?

1301
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:15,927
A rich farmer.

1302
00:46:15,928 --> 00:46:17,197
- What do you mean? - A rich farmer?

1303
00:46:17,198 --> 00:46:19,128
- For a good harvest? A bumper year? - A bumper year?

1304
00:46:19,638 --> 00:46:21,567
That's possible if they put it up at the beginning of January.

1305
00:46:21,568 --> 00:46:25,237
If it were for fecundity, it applies to a whole year.

1306
00:46:25,238 --> 00:46:27,407
Wishing for longevity and fecundity...

1307
00:46:27,408 --> 00:46:29,207
- isn't just for that year. - Exactly.

1308
00:46:29,208 --> 00:46:30,677
- They always wished for it. - That's right.

1309
00:46:30,678 --> 00:46:32,478
- That's right. - Yes. It was for a bumper year.

1310
00:46:32,818 --> 00:46:34,247
We thought it would be for good health.

1311
00:46:34,248 --> 00:46:36,518
After listening to them so much, I'm hungry again.

1312
00:46:36,548 --> 00:46:38,088
- Tae Hyun, please hurry up. - Gosh.

1313
00:46:38,118 --> 00:46:39,558
Can they solve it by tomorrow?

1314
00:46:40,188 --> 00:46:41,617
When it was for fine-dining, I could understand...

1315
00:46:41,618 --> 00:46:42,657
because it was 800 dollars.

1316
00:46:42,658 --> 00:46:44,628
But this one is 77 dollars.

1317
00:46:44,658 --> 00:46:46,827
Still, you're solving it for 20 minutes.

1318
00:46:46,828 --> 00:46:47,927
- Do we have that much time? - What are you doing?

1319
00:46:47,928 --> 00:46:49,727
- I'll go with a bumper year... - Tae Hyun.

1320
00:46:49,728 --> 00:46:51,467
- because I said it. - After thinking about it,

1321
00:46:51,468 --> 00:46:52,967
- I'll vote for the bumper year. - I think it's a bumper year too.

1322
00:46:52,968 --> 00:46:55,498
But we have to think about why it was a chicken.

1323
00:46:56,008 --> 00:46:57,167
- A chicken... - Hey.

1324
00:46:57,168 --> 00:46:58,637
I'll have to take my credit card out in ten minutes.

1325
00:46:58,638 --> 00:47:00,377
- Gosh. Should we pay for it? - Goodness.

1326
00:47:00,378 --> 00:47:02,678
- Dong Hyun, what do we do? - Come on.

1327
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,677
- Okay. Let's do it. - It was for a bumper year.

1328
00:47:04,678 --> 00:47:05,977
A chicken...

1329
00:47:05,978 --> 00:47:07,678
How should I say it? A chicken was multi-talented, so...

1330
00:47:07,778 --> 00:47:09,847
(Seung Ho.)

1331
00:47:09,848 --> 00:47:10,848
"Multi-talented."

1332
00:47:10,849 --> 00:47:13,057
- A bumper year. - That was what it meant.

1333
00:47:13,058 --> 00:47:14,487
Listen. It could be fried chicken,

1334
00:47:14,488 --> 00:47:16,157
braised chicken, and chicken yukgaejang.

1335
00:47:16,158 --> 00:47:17,327
- Okay. Anyway, - Okay.

1336
00:47:17,328 --> 00:47:19,088
- it was to wish for a bumper year. - Trust me.

1337
00:47:19,328 --> 00:47:20,398
It's incorrect.

1338
00:47:20,858 --> 00:47:21,927
Don't trust me now.

1339
00:47:21,928 --> 00:47:23,798
- That was a hard one. - Don't trust me.

1340
00:47:24,128 --> 00:47:26,298
- We don't have to pay for it. - We won't have time for it.

1341
00:47:26,368 --> 00:47:29,038
We'll give each a chance since we don't have much time.

1342
00:47:29,198 --> 00:47:30,938
- I got it. For fecundity. - Incorrect.

1343
00:47:31,608 --> 00:47:33,278
It was to prevent an epidemic disease.

1344
00:47:33,508 --> 00:47:34,537
Preventing an epidemic disease. Incorrect.

1345
00:47:34,538 --> 00:47:35,808
I got it. To prevent evil spirits.

1346
00:47:35,838 --> 00:47:36,978
- Correct. - Gosh.

1347
00:47:37,678 --> 00:47:38,777
- Come on. - That was what chicken was for?

1348
00:47:38,778 --> 00:47:40,417
- From the chicken blood? - We almost got it right.

1349
00:47:40,418 --> 00:47:42,348
- The bad energy. - Was it the chicken blood?

1350
00:47:42,578 --> 00:47:43,887
It wasn't because of the chicken blood.

1351
00:47:43,888 --> 00:47:45,687
- It was the crowing. - Correct.

1352
00:47:45,688 --> 00:47:46,757
- Was it because of the crowing? - What?

1353
00:47:46,758 --> 00:47:48,288
It crows at dawn to drive the evil spirits away.

1354
00:47:48,788 --> 00:47:49,927
- I see. - Right.

1355
00:47:49,928 --> 00:47:51,528
Dong Hyun, you almost caused us trouble.

1356
00:47:52,028 --> 00:47:53,897
We almost got it right.

1357
00:47:53,898 --> 00:47:55,327
So, the two of you are left.

1358
00:47:55,328 --> 00:47:56,568
What about the rock-paper-scissors against each other's backs?

1359
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:58,597
(Laughing)

1360
00:47:58,598 --> 00:48:00,698
If you don't play it, you lose. Rock-paper-scissors.

1361
00:48:01,868 --> 00:48:03,807
(Who ended up paying for it?)

1362
00:48:03,808 --> 00:48:04,837
(Confused)

1363
00:48:04,838 --> 00:48:06,107
Please hand him the bill.

1364
00:48:06,108 --> 00:48:07,408
- Who is it? - Gosh.

1365
00:48:07,908 --> 00:48:10,208
(Tae Hyun has to pay 77 dollars.)

1366
00:48:10,278 --> 00:48:12,548
(The result)

1367
00:48:12,678 --> 00:48:15,477
- Did you enjoy it? - It was so good.

1368
00:48:15,478 --> 00:48:16,687
(Tea Hyun is the one who has to pay for it.)

1369
00:48:16,688 --> 00:48:18,087
- It's 77 dollars. - I've never had...

1370
00:48:18,088 --> 00:48:19,457
the seasoned chicken salad before.

1371
00:48:19,458 --> 00:48:21,158
- Did you enjoy it? - It was so tasty. Yes.

1372
00:48:22,988 --> 00:48:24,127
Here it is.

1373
00:48:24,128 --> 00:48:26,097
- Thank you for the food. - Yes.

1374
00:48:26,098 --> 00:48:29,327
We had our lunch in Eulji-ro.

1375
00:48:29,328 --> 00:48:31,468
We had kimchi stew and chicken gomtang.

1376
00:48:31,998 --> 00:48:33,397
(Lunch recommendations in Eulji-ro)

1377
00:48:33,398 --> 00:48:34,997
(Chicken gomtang: A dish to invigorate oneself)

1378
00:48:34,998 --> 00:48:36,407
(Chicken gomtang: A light chicken gomtang is the best for lunch!)

1379
00:48:36,408 --> 00:48:37,907
(Chicken gomtang: The perfect combination...)

1380
00:48:37,908 --> 00:48:39,307
(of light chicken gomtang and fresh seasoned chicken salad)

1381
00:48:39,308 --> 00:48:40,737
(Kimchi stew: My soul food for eternity!)

1382
00:48:40,738 --> 00:48:42,107
(Kimchi stew: Kimchi stew for lunch. The gomtang and drink for dinner)

1383
00:48:42,108 --> 00:48:45,177
They say Eulji-ro is trendy. Let's have desserts here.

1384
00:48:45,178 --> 00:48:47,578
- Let's go to a trendy dessert shop. - We want to visit it, right?

1385
00:48:47,718 --> 00:48:49,377
- Let's go. - We should go.

1386
00:48:49,378 --> 00:48:50,688
Okay. I got it.

1387
00:48:50,818 --> 00:48:51,988
- Let's go. - Okay.

1388
00:48:52,248 --> 00:48:54,018
- It was a hearty meal. - Yes.

1389
00:48:54,658 --> 00:48:55,757
Gosh. Seriously.

1390
00:48:55,758 --> 00:48:58,088
- I'm so full. - Thanks for the food, ma'am.

1391
00:48:58,328 --> 00:49:01,498
Okay. This is Eulji-ro.

1392
00:49:01,598 --> 00:49:02,598
Yes.

1393
00:49:02,998 --> 00:49:05,427
There are many print shops here.

1394
00:49:05,428 --> 00:49:06,468
Yes. Print shops.

1395
00:49:06,798 --> 00:49:07,968
You're right. It's a print shop.

1396
00:49:08,368 --> 00:49:09,368
You're right.

1397
00:49:09,468 --> 00:49:14,608
(The prints shops every alleyway are busy.)

1398
00:49:15,438 --> 00:49:17,847
In the past, Eulji-ro was...

1399
00:49:17,848 --> 00:49:19,247
I'm talking about the past again.

1400
00:49:19,248 --> 00:49:21,218
What were Eulji-ro and Myeong-dong known for?

1401
00:49:21,478 --> 00:49:22,677
- I don't know. - For movies.

1402
00:49:22,678 --> 00:49:23,717
- I see. - Movies?

1403
00:49:23,718 --> 00:49:24,847
- All movie companies... - Chungmu-ro.

1404
00:49:24,848 --> 00:49:26,657
Used to be here in Chungmu-ro.

1405
00:49:26,658 --> 00:49:27,687
Really?

1406
00:49:27,688 --> 00:49:30,688
(Chungmu-ro was the hub of Korean movies.)

1407
00:49:30,928 --> 00:49:34,728
During the renaissance of movies, the posters...

1408
00:49:35,398 --> 00:49:37,897
and promotional brochures were made here.

1409
00:49:37,898 --> 00:49:38,927
- Really? - Tea Hyun. You experienced...

1410
00:49:38,928 --> 00:49:40,167
the black-and-white TV era.

1411
00:49:40,168 --> 00:49:41,597
I went through that era, indeed.

1412
00:49:41,598 --> 00:49:42,907
You turned the knob to turn on the TV.

1413
00:49:42,908 --> 00:49:44,568
I had that too.

1414
00:49:45,008 --> 00:49:46,607
- Look. - You opened the TV cabinet.

1415
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,777
(A fine cafe is in the middle of the print shop alleyway.)

1416
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:49,778
It's A Bakery.

1417
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:52,147
- Gosh. - Hey. Why is it a bakery?

1418
00:49:52,148 --> 00:49:54,217
Let's promise to restrain ourselves before we go inside.

1419
00:49:54,218 --> 00:49:55,218
- What? - Seriously.

1420
00:49:55,219 --> 00:49:56,317
- Okay. - If you can't finish it,

1421
00:49:56,318 --> 00:49:57,588
- you pay for it. - Okay.

1422
00:49:59,388 --> 00:50:02,618
(A unique shop hidden in Eulji-ro)

1423
00:50:03,688 --> 00:50:06,928
(With the concept of a Japanese cafe in the 1980s, )

1424
00:50:10,568 --> 00:50:13,868
(one can enjoy a different kind of coffee time here.)

1425
00:50:17,208 --> 00:50:19,937
(At the bakery section, )

1426
00:50:19,938 --> 00:50:24,507
(you can enjoy Japanese-style breads.)

1427
00:50:24,508 --> 00:50:26,347
- Okay? - Goodness.

1428
00:50:26,348 --> 00:50:28,547
- Goodness. - They sell many tasty ones.

1429
00:50:28,548 --> 00:50:30,218
- This one is really tasty. - We're in trouble.

1430
00:50:30,448 --> 00:50:31,587
What is this now?

1431
00:50:31,588 --> 00:50:32,647
I love this.

1432
00:50:32,648 --> 00:50:34,087
- Hello. - What is it?

1433
00:50:34,088 --> 00:50:35,287
We have to have this, Tae Hyun.

1434
00:50:35,288 --> 00:50:37,027
- Are you going to choose one? - Here, we play an individual match.

1435
00:50:37,028 --> 00:50:39,228
- Yes. - You can choose the bread here.

1436
00:50:39,388 --> 00:50:41,428
- What is it? - It's like a rusk.

1437
00:50:42,058 --> 00:50:44,497
- The crunchy one? - The crunchy and sweet one.

1438
00:50:44,498 --> 00:50:46,538
This one. It'll taste good for sure.

1439
00:50:46,738 --> 00:50:48,937
We have to try the melon bun with cream.

1440
00:50:48,938 --> 00:50:50,768
You have to try the signature menu.

1441
00:50:51,008 --> 00:50:52,537
- It's a melon bun. - A melon bun.

1442
00:50:52,538 --> 00:50:54,708
The one they have the most is their signature menu.

1443
00:50:55,608 --> 00:50:57,347
- You have to try it. - You're right.

1444
00:50:57,348 --> 00:50:58,348
A melon bun with cream.

1445
00:50:58,349 --> 00:51:00,017
Okay. Dae Ho chose a melon bun.

1446
00:51:00,018 --> 00:51:01,048
Gosh. It's crowded.

1447
00:51:01,178 --> 00:51:02,477
- Go ahead. - So, we picked two melon buns?

1448
00:51:02,478 --> 00:51:04,288
- I'll get the melon bun too. - Is there one without cream?

1449
00:51:04,588 --> 00:51:05,887
Sang Uk and I will share.

1450
00:51:05,888 --> 00:51:06,888
- Okay. - Okay.

1451
00:51:07,488 --> 00:51:08,717
It feels heavy in the hand.

1452
00:51:08,718 --> 00:51:10,257
- Hey, honestly... - It's heavy.

1453
00:51:10,258 --> 00:51:11,927
- Honestly, - It's filled with cream.

1454
00:51:11,928 --> 00:51:13,427
- you should give up one. - Okay.

1455
00:51:13,428 --> 00:51:14,628
We have to try this.

1456
00:51:15,558 --> 00:51:16,767
(Should we try the rusk first?)

1457
00:51:16,768 --> 00:51:18,567
When we are 5 people, having 7 pieces of bread...

1458
00:51:18,568 --> 00:51:19,667
- You can go that way. - is nothing.

1459
00:51:19,668 --> 00:51:20,768
What should we do?

1460
00:51:20,798 --> 00:51:22,368
It tastes better when we tear it.

1461
00:51:22,638 --> 00:51:23,968
We have to tear it.

1462
00:51:26,208 --> 00:51:29,708
(How does the retro flavor of Eulji-ro taste?)

1463
00:51:30,408 --> 00:51:31,608
(Amazed)

1464
00:51:32,078 --> 00:51:33,448
- It's super tasty. - Is it good?

1465
00:51:33,748 --> 00:51:35,118
Was it tasty after tearing it?

1466
00:51:35,748 --> 00:51:38,517
- It's crunchy outside, - Eulji-ro is trendy for a reason.

1467
00:51:38,518 --> 00:51:40,558
- and it's moist inside. - Gosh.

1468
00:51:42,058 --> 00:51:43,987
- Gosh. It's so good. - Goodness.

1469
00:51:43,988 --> 00:51:44,988
(Amazed)

1470
00:51:46,528 --> 00:51:48,057
(Next is the signature melon bun.)

1471
00:51:48,058 --> 00:51:49,228
It has to be tasty.

1472
00:51:50,828 --> 00:51:52,827
See? It's filled with cream.

1473
00:51:52,828 --> 00:51:54,638
- Amazing. - It's fresh cream.

1474
00:51:55,168 --> 00:51:57,208
- It's so tasty. - It has to be good.

1475
00:51:58,568 --> 00:51:59,607
(The frown of the truth)

1476
00:51:59,608 --> 00:52:01,208
What is this?

1477
00:52:02,208 --> 00:52:04,377
I really like this one.

1478
00:52:04,378 --> 00:52:05,808
But that's even better.

1479
00:52:06,208 --> 00:52:07,648
I'm waiting for my turn.

1480
00:52:10,848 --> 00:52:11,918
Gosh. It's good.

1481
00:52:12,818 --> 00:52:14,787
Dong Hyun, you were right about the melon bun.

1482
00:52:14,788 --> 00:52:17,257
(Dong Hyun, you were right about the melon bun.)

1483
00:52:17,258 --> 00:52:20,458
It feels like I'm enjoying in the middle of a melon farm.

1484
00:52:20,728 --> 00:52:21,798
The cream is a bit...

1485
00:52:22,058 --> 00:52:23,898
- Gosh. - I'll finally try the melon bun.

1486
00:52:24,068 --> 00:52:25,228
- Is this it? - It's delicious.

1487
00:52:25,528 --> 00:52:26,968
Tae Hyun, be careful when you're eating it.

1488
00:52:27,398 --> 00:52:28,797
Why? Because it splatters?

1489
00:52:28,798 --> 00:52:30,008
No, because it's dangerously good.

1490
00:52:32,568 --> 00:52:35,678
(He takes a bite of the one that is dangerously tasty.)

1491
00:52:36,978 --> 00:52:38,977
- Hey, they did put... - Right?

1492
00:52:38,978 --> 00:52:40,547
- the melon ice bar in it. - Are you having it?

1493
00:52:40,548 --> 00:52:41,577
I'll try it without the cream.

1494
00:52:41,578 --> 00:52:42,617
When we were at the fine-dining restaurant,

1495
00:52:42,618 --> 00:52:44,887
we finished that ice cream.

1496
00:52:44,888 --> 00:52:47,188
Gosh, this coffee. This coffee is amazing.

1497
00:52:48,088 --> 00:52:49,517
(They finish their lunch like that.)

1498
00:52:49,518 --> 00:52:51,428
It's nice.

1499
00:52:51,758 --> 00:52:54,727
Now, we have to go and eat dinner again.

1500
00:52:54,728 --> 00:52:56,568
(The discussion on dinner recommendations starts now.)

1501
00:52:56,698 --> 00:52:58,428
What is a good dinner menu in Eulji-ro?

1502
00:52:59,068 --> 00:53:00,397
Don't employees have a drink...

1503
00:53:00,398 --> 00:53:01,768
while eating dinner?

1504
00:53:02,098 --> 00:53:04,137
- They have a drink and go home. - A dish for drinks.

1505
00:53:04,138 --> 00:53:06,308
- A simple dish for drinks is good. - That's the case for Eulji-ro.

1506
00:53:06,978 --> 00:53:10,678
There was a restaurant on Tzuyang's YouTube video.

1507
00:53:11,548 --> 00:53:13,317
It was a place where you could enjoy a glass of beer...

1508
00:53:13,318 --> 00:53:15,118
while having some simple dishes.

1509
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:16,318
I see.

1510
00:53:16,518 --> 00:53:18,287
- A place like a street food stall? - Yes.

1511
00:53:18,288 --> 00:53:19,347
(A bar with street food in a food-tent style)

1512
00:53:19,348 --> 00:53:21,188
When it's a nice day, you can sit outside,

1513
00:53:21,488 --> 00:53:24,088
order the dried young pollack, and enjoy a drink.

1514
00:53:24,188 --> 00:53:26,127
That's the vibe I like.

1515
00:53:26,128 --> 00:53:27,997
Drinking beer while having dried young pollack.

1516
00:53:27,998 --> 00:53:29,357
And have a draft beer.

(Seung Ho recommends a place too.)

1522
00:53:39,408 --> 00:53:41,877
They serve you seafood.

1523
00:53:41,878 --> 00:53:45,648
And the seafood is delivered from the sea on that very day.

1524
00:53:45,948 --> 00:53:47,117
It's fresh off the sea.

1525
00:53:47,118 --> 00:53:48,878
- It's a small dish, right? - Yes.

1526
00:53:49,018 --> 00:53:50,248
- I see. - That's an option.

1527
00:53:50,648 --> 00:53:52,518
They don't have a menu.

1528
00:53:52,748 --> 00:53:54,257
- That sounds good. - They serve whatever...

1529
00:53:54,258 --> 00:53:55,657
- they received on that day. - They don't have a menu?

1530
00:53:55,658 --> 00:53:56,987
They serve whatever they have at that moment.

1531
00:53:56,988 --> 00:53:57,988
Are you sure it's a same-day delivery?

1532
00:53:57,989 --> 00:54:00,058
I have the seafood right out of Haeundae.

- You... - A man from Busan.

1534
00:54:04,998 --> 00:54:06,297
- Really? - When I have seafood,

1535
00:54:06,298 --> 00:54:07,738
and if it's not tasty, I'll put it down right away.

1536
00:54:08,238 --> 00:54:10,037
I'm cold-hearted when it comes to seafood.

1537

1549
00:54:35,458 --> 00:54:36,828
- Totally. - In that case,

1550
00:54:37,028 --> 00:54:38,468
I'll choose the street food because of you.

1551
00:54:39,968 --> 00:54:41,497
Gosh.

1552
00:54:41,498 --> 00:54:43,707
Honestly, I really want to have seafood.

1553
00:54:43,708 --> 00:54:46,238
But because of Dong Hyun, I don't want to choose it.

1554

Come on. There'll be an individual match.

1555

1559

we don't have to pay.

1560

1564
00:55:06,088 --> 00:55:07,097

00:55:27,678 --> 00:55:29,717
Let me see what it's like to have Dong Hyun...

1576
00:55:29,718 --> 00:55:31,088
as a safety cushion.

1577
00:55:31,418 --> 00:55:32,548
Bring it on, then.

1578
00:55:33,658 --> 00:55:35,387
I can't stand him doing that.

1579
00:55:35,388 --> 00:55:36,788
(Tae Hyun and Dong Hyun's individual match is coming soon.)

1580
00:55:37,058 --> 00:55:38,357
Okay. Let's go and have dinner.

1581
00:55:38,358 --> 00:55:39,488
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1582
00:55:39,558 --> 00:55:40,597
Those were good desserts.

1583
00:55:40,598 --> 00:55:42,457
Bye. We enjoyed them.

1584
00:55:42,458 --> 00:55:45,168
(We'll see you at dinner!)

1585
00:55:45,798 --> 00:55:49,568
(After a few hours)

1586
00:55:49,968 --> 00:55:52,308
(The employees walk quickly as they get out of work.)

1587
00:55:53,278 --> 00:55:56,378
(People gather around the alleyway of restaurants for dinner.)

1588
00:55:57,778 --> 00:55:59,277
- Goodness. - Gosh.

1589
00:55:59,278 --> 00:56:01,277
- This place is... - The alleyway screams good food.

1590
00:56:01,278 --> 00:56:03,217
This place has to be good.

1591
00:56:03,218 --> 00:56:04,918
Gosh. I should have chosen to have seafood.

1592
00:56:05,148 --> 00:56:07,058
I'm starving all of a sudden.

1593
00:56:07,758 --> 00:56:09,717
The alleyway tastes good.

1594
00:56:09,718 --> 00:56:10,788
- Yes. - This place is...

1595
00:56:11,288 --> 00:56:13,858
The S Restaurant. The food is delivered on the same day.

1596
00:56:14,298 --> 00:56:15,997
- Same-day delivery. - Same-day delivery.

1597
00:56:15,998 --> 00:56:17,097
- Come. - Gosh.

1598
00:56:17,098 --> 00:56:19,097
If the food isn't tasty,

1599
00:56:19,098 --> 00:56:20,997
- they can't survive here. - Hey.

1600
00:56:20,998 --> 00:56:22,897
How can one find this place?

1601
00:56:22,898 --> 00:56:24,768
- Hello. - Hello.

1602
00:56:25,738 --> 00:56:26,778
- Goodness. - Gosh.

1603
00:56:27,138 --> 00:56:28,877
- Hello. - Gosh. Hello.

1604
00:56:28,878 --> 00:56:30,348
- Wait. - Goodness.

1605
00:56:30,848 --> 00:56:32,147
This is the whole restaurant.

1606
00:56:32,148 --> 00:56:33,517
- The table around it is all. - Are there seats on the other side?

1607
00:56:33,518 --> 00:56:34,877
They are on each side.

1608
00:56:34,878 --> 00:56:36,147
I haven't tried the food yet,

1609
00:56:36,148 --> 00:56:37,917
- It has a nice vibe. - but I know it'll be good.

1610
00:56:37,918 --> 00:56:38,987
I would have regretted...

1611
00:56:38,988 --> 00:56:40,018
- if I didn't choose this place. - Right.

1612
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,257
It's just...

1613
00:56:42,258 --> 00:56:44,488
I go to Masan and Tongyeong every day...

1614
00:56:44,588 --> 00:56:47,557
and buy the seafood at the auction in the early morning.

1615
00:56:47,558 --> 00:56:49,258
(He chooses fresh ingredients at the auction at dawn himself.)

1616
00:56:49,987 --> 00:56:51,956
Then I get them delivered here where I prepare them...

1617
00:56:51,957 --> 00:56:53,397
and serve them to the customers.

1618
00:56:54,857 --> 00:56:58,097
(The flavors of the sea one can enjoy in Seoul)

1619
00:56:58,397 --> 00:57:00,597
(People get in line to get in.)

1620
00:57:01,137 --> 00:57:03,207
(At the tables with the kitchen in the middle, )

1621
00:57:03,607 --> 00:57:07,037
(people come and sit after work.)

1622
00:57:07,737 --> 00:57:11,207
(Then they can enjoy fresh raw fish right off the kitchen.)

1623
00:57:13,177 --> 00:57:16,547
(DMR 1: The seafood caught and bought on the same day)

1624
00:57:16,787 --> 00:57:18,886
All the seafood we serve...

1625
00:57:18,887 --> 00:57:21,286
- comes from Gyeongsang Province. - Yes.

1626
00:57:21,287 --> 00:57:24,286
So Dae Ho will find the menu very familiar.

1627
00:57:24,287 --> 00:57:25,857
- That's right. - Yes.

1628
00:57:25,987 --> 00:57:28,426
Is there a recommendation for each day?

1629
00:57:28,427 --> 00:57:30,597
Our menu changes every day.

1630
00:57:30,967 --> 00:57:32,296
It changes every day.

1631
00:57:32,297 --> 00:57:34,036
One thing is good on a certain day.

1632
00:57:34,037 --> 00:57:35,566
- Please take a look. - Okay.

1633
00:57:35,567 --> 00:57:38,336
Gosh. We'll take a look at it.

1634
00:57:38,337 --> 00:57:39,436
I don't even have to look at it.

1635
00:57:39,437 --> 00:57:41,276
(Assorted 3 kinds of raw fish, flavorful unboned sliced raw fish)

1636
00:57:41,277 --> 00:57:43,777
- There's unboned sliced raw fish. - We should order that.

1637
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,306
I think we have to have the assorted raw fish...

1638
00:57:45,307 --> 00:57:46,646
of three kinds that were delivered today.

1639
00:57:46,647 --> 00:57:47,976
The three assorted raw fish are...

1640
00:57:47,977 --> 00:57:49,516
The blackhead, yellowtail, and so-iuy mullet.

1641
00:57:49,517 --> 00:57:50,616
What is the blackhead?

1642
00:57:50,617 --> 00:57:53,287
The Seoul people might not know it.

1643
00:57:53,457 --> 00:57:54,887
- It's the blackhead seabream. - You're right.

1644
00:57:55,287 --> 00:57:57,556
- It's the blackhead seabream. - The blackhead seabream.

1645
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,026
- It's the seabream. - I see.

1646
00:57:59,027 --> 00:58:00,696
They are blackhead seabream, yellowtail, and so-iuy mullet,

1647
00:58:00,697 --> 00:58:01,726
which means we have to order it.

1648
00:58:01,727 --> 00:58:04,196
I like so-iuy mullet. It's not expensive but tasty.

1649
00:58:04,197 --> 00:58:06,866
The so-iuy mullet looks red on top.

1650
00:58:06,867 --> 00:58:07,867
- Right. - It's delicious.

1651
00:58:07,868 --> 00:58:09,167
I love so-iuy mullet.

1652
00:58:10,637 --> 00:58:12,607
The live small octopus tangtangi is 25 dollars...

1653
00:58:12,937 --> 00:58:13,976
in the middle of Seoul!

1654
00:58:13,977 --> 00:58:15,176
- For one serving? - Yes.

1655
00:58:15,177 --> 00:58:16,546
Also, we'll get raw sea squirt.

1656
00:58:16,547 --> 00:58:18,506
- And... - The cuttlefish.

1657
00:58:18,507 --> 00:58:20,476
For oysters, they have triploid oysters.

1658
00:58:20,477 --> 00:58:21,646
But I don't eat oysters.

1659
00:58:21,647 --> 00:58:22,647
- You don't? - No.

1660
00:58:22,648 --> 00:58:24,386
You can order it first...

1661
00:58:24,387 --> 00:58:25,946
so that one of us can eat later.

1662
00:58:25,947 --> 00:58:27,357
Yes. Order one for us.

1663
00:58:28,757 --> 00:58:29,787
There are two.

1664
00:58:30,187 --> 00:58:31,187
- Sounds great. - What's this one?

1665
00:58:31,188 --> 00:58:32,386
(Order)

1666
00:58:32,387 --> 00:58:34,797
- I'll make a recommendation. - That would be great.

1667
00:58:34,997 --> 00:58:36,897
The eel and green onion hot pot is popular.

1668
00:58:37,427 --> 00:58:38,566
- The eel and green onion hot pot? - Yes.

1669
00:58:38,567 --> 00:58:40,466
What kind of eel is it?

1670
00:58:40,467 --> 00:58:42,096
- It's the sea eel. - Okay.

1671
00:58:42,097 --> 00:58:44,106
I'll prepare those dishes for you.

1672
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:45,966
- Thank you. - I feel hungry now.

1673
00:58:45,967 --> 00:58:48,106
Would we be okay with street food...

1674
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,277
after having fancy food like this?

1675
00:58:50,577 --> 00:58:52,546
I didn't expect it to be like this.

1676
00:58:52,547 --> 00:58:53,547
(I didn't expect it to be eating a variety of food like this.)

1677
00:58:53,548 --> 00:58:54,616
Then we'll...

1678
00:58:54,617 --> 00:58:56,376
(Amazed)

1679
00:58:56,377 --> 00:58:57,587
The oyster looks amazing.

1680
00:58:58,047 --> 00:58:59,846
- It's really big. - Right.

1681
00:58:59,847 --> 00:59:01,087
Triploid oysters are really big.

1682
00:59:01,417 --> 00:59:03,686
Everything is made right in front of us.

1683
00:59:03,687 --> 00:59:05,987
(Cleaned right away to be used)

1684
00:59:09,097 --> 00:59:12,426
It's exciting as well as we can see everything.

1685
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:13,636
(The fresh seafood in front of them whets their appetites.)

1686
00:59:13,637 --> 00:59:14,836
Shall we start with the quiz?

1687
00:59:14,837 --> 00:59:17,007
- The food isn't even out yet. - Right.

1688
00:59:17,237 --> 00:59:18,536
The food isn't even out yet.

1689
00:59:18,537 --> 00:59:19,936
(The gold medalist is too much in a hurry.)

1690
00:59:19,937 --> 00:59:22,577
He sounded so natural that I almost fell for it.

1691
00:59:23,207 --> 00:59:24,547
We almost went with the quiz first.

1692
00:59:25,277 --> 00:59:26,447
It's the sea squirt.

1693
00:59:26,817 --> 00:59:29,246
- Sea squirt? Over there? - Yes. It's the sea squirt.

1694
00:59:29,247 --> 00:59:30,387
(The kitchen commentary of the commentator)

1695
00:59:30,917 --> 00:59:33,787
The steamed sea squirts taste really nice and crunchy.

1696
00:59:35,557 --> 00:59:36,586
- It's out. - The vinegar gochujang...

1697
00:59:36,587 --> 00:59:37,656
- is all you need. - Thank you.

1698
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,687
- It's served like this? - Right.

1699
00:59:39,887 --> 00:59:41,297
(Gosh!)

1700
00:59:41,497 --> 00:59:42,556
It looks delicious.

1701
00:59:42,557 --> 00:59:44,427
(The guy from Busan can't take his eyes off of the kitchen.)

1702
00:59:46,227 --> 00:59:48,237
(Full of the scent of the sea...)

1703
00:59:49,837 --> 00:59:52,807
(and with a fun and crunchy texture)

1704
00:59:54,837 --> 00:59:56,746
Is it the water parsley underneath it?

1705
00:59:56,747 --> 00:59:58,077
- Please explain the dish to us. - Yes. It's the water parsley.

1706
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,877
It will taste much better with the vinegar gochujang.

1707
01:00:01,847 --> 01:00:05,016
(A bite with the water parsley after a dip into the vinegar gochujang)

1708
01:00:05,017 --> 01:00:06,286
With the water parsley?

1709
01:00:06,287 --> 01:00:08,287
You can have it together or separately.

1710
01:00:10,787 --> 01:00:12,527
Like this? It's my first time trying this.

1711
01:00:13,727 --> 01:00:14,796
(Looking)

1712
01:00:14,797 --> 01:00:16,397
(Taking a look...)

1713
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,597
(and putting it straight into his mouth)

1714
01:00:19,397 --> 01:00:21,966
Gosh, check out the sound. What's going on?

1715
01:00:21,967 --> 01:00:23,536
- It feels alive. - It's really fresh!

1716
01:00:23,537 --> 01:00:25,267
- It would be great. - Does the water squirt out?

1717
01:00:26,567 --> 01:00:27,776
(The crunchy sound that whets their appetite)

1718
01:00:27,777 --> 01:00:29,377
I've never had this raw.

1719
01:00:29,637 --> 01:00:32,146
I like the sea pineapple, but when you eat a certain part,

1720
01:00:32,147 --> 01:00:33,916
the scent can feel too strong.

1721
01:00:33,917 --> 01:00:34,946
This feels clean without any of that.

1722
01:00:34,947 --> 01:00:36,816
This really is similar to the sea pineapple.

1723
01:00:36,817 --> 01:00:39,717
It's similar, but this tastes a bit sweeter.

1724
01:00:40,387 --> 01:00:41,986
- Gosh. - Well...

1725
01:00:41,987 --> 01:00:44,456
We should give them each a bite.

1726
01:00:44,457 --> 01:00:46,587
- No. Go with rock-paper-scissors. - We'll go with rock-paper-scissors.

1727
01:00:46,957 --> 01:00:49,626
- Let's follow the rules. - I'll lose with all this pressure.

1728
01:00:49,627 --> 01:00:52,797
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1729
01:00:53,367 --> 01:00:54,997
(Grasping his fist)

1730
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:57,137
(Disappointed)

1731
01:00:57,667 --> 01:00:58,806
(He wins the sea squirt.)

1732
01:00:58,807 --> 01:01:00,576
- Gosh. - All right.

1733
01:01:00,577 --> 01:01:02,436
It looked like he enjoyed that more than his gold medal.

1734
01:01:02,437 --> 01:01:03,907
Could we get a plate and a pair of chopsticks?

1735
01:01:05,247 --> 01:01:06,307
It's amazing.

1736
01:01:06,717 --> 01:01:07,877
It's so good.

1737
01:01:10,987 --> 01:01:12,217
(Dipping a generous amount of vinegar gochujang)

1738
01:01:13,717 --> 01:01:14,756
It sounded amazing.

1739
01:01:14,757 --> 01:01:16,087
(It sounded amazing.)

1740
01:01:18,287 --> 01:01:19,957
How is it?

1741
01:01:20,457 --> 01:01:21,827
(Crunch!)

1742
01:01:24,297 --> 01:01:25,326
(Amazed)

1743
01:01:25,327 --> 01:01:26,496
- This really is great. - It's amazing, isn't it?

1744
01:01:26,497 --> 01:01:27,666
(The freshness that can be felt inside the mouth)

1745
01:01:27,667 --> 01:01:29,067
Why spit this back out?

1746
01:01:29,597 --> 01:01:30,606
How is it?

1747
01:01:30,607 --> 01:01:32,737
(Sea squirt ASMR)

1748
01:01:32,807 --> 01:01:34,937
- How is it? - Where are you going, tangtangi?

1749
01:01:36,337 --> 01:01:37,906
(The live small octopus tangtangi is ready.)

1750
01:01:37,907 --> 01:01:39,147
Where are you going, tangtangi?

1751
01:01:39,347 --> 01:01:40,416
(The tangtangi has gone far away.)

1752
01:01:40,417 --> 01:01:41,617
The sea squirt is amazing.

1753
01:01:41,947 --> 01:01:43,717
The food comes in great portions too.

1754
01:01:43,987 --> 01:01:45,517
The owner here is generous.

1755
01:01:46,187 --> 01:01:47,987
(Stretching out)

1756
01:01:49,517 --> 01:01:53,457
(Chopped into bite-sized pieces)

1757
01:01:56,657 --> 01:01:58,196
(Sesame seeds are sprinkled on top.)

1758
01:01:58,197 --> 01:02:00,936
Is this eaten right away?

1759
01:02:00,937 --> 01:02:02,066
You must have it with sesame oil.

1760
01:02:02,067 --> 01:02:03,767
- There isn't any. - No way.

1761
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:05,636
(Tae Hyun got a big piece of the tangtangi.)

1762
01:02:05,637 --> 01:02:09,036
- That must be really fresh. - This is the small octopus.

1763
01:02:09,037 --> 01:02:10,307
I eat a lot of seafood.

1764
01:02:11,077 --> 01:02:13,276
He's eating this the best.

1765
01:02:13,277 --> 01:02:15,477
- Tae Hyun clapped like this. - He clapped.

1766
01:02:15,847 --> 01:02:17,986
Tae Hyun clapped like this.

1767
01:02:17,987 --> 01:02:19,516
- He clapped like a seal. - He clapped while eating.

1768
01:02:19,517 --> 01:02:22,017
You ate so little when we had the kimchi stew.

1769
01:02:22,157 --> 01:02:23,317
Gosh.

1770
01:02:23,887 --> 01:02:25,626
You all know this can bring back up a cow that has collapsed, right?

1771
01:02:25,627 --> 01:02:26,686
- Yes. - That's how good...

1772
01:02:26,687 --> 01:02:27,697
the small octopus is for your strength.

1773
01:02:29,397 --> 01:02:31,367
(Regaining his strength!)

1774
01:02:33,127 --> 01:02:35,696
(The tangtangi is being slurped.)

1775
01:02:35,697 --> 01:02:37,966
It's so fresh.

1776
01:02:37,967 --> 01:02:40,036
It feels like this is fresh off the sea.

1777
01:02:40,037 --> 01:02:42,376
There's so much of the tangtangi served.

1778
01:02:42,377 --> 01:02:44,247
That's a lot given for what it's worth.

1779
01:02:44,347 --> 01:02:46,407
Tangtangi is really thick.

1780
01:02:47,877 --> 01:02:50,617
There are a lot of thick ones caught these days.

1781
01:02:50,687 --> 01:02:52,417
(Dumbfounded)

1782
01:02:53,887 --> 01:02:55,016
(This is amazing.)

1783
01:02:55,017 --> 01:02:57,156
Coming here after work...

1784
01:02:57,157 --> 01:03:00,027
and having this would solve everything.

1785
01:03:00,457 --> 01:03:02,627
Can I make a reservation for 7pm?

1786
01:03:03,057 --> 01:03:05,497
I'll come here at 9pm with my manager.

1787
01:03:05,897 --> 01:03:07,767
Dae Ho?

1788
01:03:08,397 --> 01:03:10,666
Sang Uk ate the previous one, so let's give this one to Dae Ho.

1789
01:03:10,667 --> 01:03:11,667
Okay.

1790
01:03:11,668 --> 01:03:13,537
Sang Uk should agree with this first.

1791
01:03:13,937 --> 01:03:15,776
- This will be given to Dae Ho. - This will be given to Dae Ho.

1792
01:03:15,777 --> 01:03:17,547
- You had the sea squirt. - Hold on!

1793
01:03:17,847 --> 01:03:19,807
- No! Give it to him. - He couldn't answer!

1794
01:03:20,377 --> 01:03:22,147
He paused for around three seconds!

1795
01:03:22,747 --> 01:03:24,946
- You cursed with your eyes, right? - He hesitated.

1796
01:03:24,947 --> 01:03:26,117
There must be something else that will be served to me.

1797
01:03:26,887 --> 01:03:28,386
- Gosh. - More can be given.

1798
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:29,817
This is enough for me.

1799
01:03:30,887 --> 01:03:31,986
Dae Ho should try it first.

1800
01:03:31,987 --> 01:03:34,796
Let's do this quiz when the raw fish is served.

1801
01:03:34,797 --> 01:03:35,797
- Okay. - Okay.

1802
01:03:35,798 --> 01:03:38,097
- That sounds good. - The raw fish is the main dish.

1803
01:03:38,897 --> 01:03:40,027
(Chuckling)

1804
01:03:40,897 --> 01:03:42,297
It's quite tough.

1805
01:03:44,307 --> 01:03:46,877
- Right. - It's quite tough.

1806
01:03:47,207 --> 01:03:49,507
A large one was served and the suckers are really strong.

1807
01:03:51,007 --> 01:03:52,246
Here is the raw fish.

1808
01:03:52,247 --> 01:03:54,217
(The raw fish finally gets served!)

1809
01:03:54,817 --> 01:03:56,177
Why didn't I choose this?

1810
01:04:01,517 --> 01:04:04,027
(The raw so-iuy mullet with a light and clean taste)

1811
01:04:06,587 --> 01:04:10,667
(The raw blackhead seabream with its chewy texture)

1812
01:04:14,537 --> 01:04:17,167
(The raw yellowtail with its thick and tender texture)

1813
01:04:17,967 --> 01:04:20,807
(Glossy)

1814
01:04:21,807 --> 01:04:23,907
The raw fish is here. It's the main dish.

1815
01:04:24,647 --> 01:04:26,046
- Gosh. It's great. - Gosh.

1816
01:04:26,047 --> 01:04:28,547
The makjang and perilla leaves will be served.

1817
01:04:28,817 --> 01:04:31,617
The makjang should be mixed with the vinegar gochujang and garlic.

1818
01:04:32,387 --> 01:04:33,486
It's served like that?

1819
01:04:33,487 --> 01:04:34,586
(Amazed)

1820
01:04:34,587 --> 01:04:35,857
Check out the size of the makjang.

1821
01:04:36,517 --> 01:04:37,826
This much was given.

1822
01:04:37,827 --> 01:04:39,286
I'll recommend a way...

1823
01:04:39,287 --> 01:04:42,896
to enjoy the raw fish just like in Masan.

1824
01:04:42,897 --> 01:04:44,766
Hold on. I'll add a bit of vinegar gochujang.

1825
01:04:44,767 --> 01:04:46,566
- You need some vinegar gochujang. - Really?

1826
01:04:46,567 --> 01:04:49,167
This is the Gyeongsang Province way.

1827
01:04:51,437 --> 01:04:53,566
I've only seen it with just the makjang before.

1828
01:04:53,567 --> 01:04:55,736
- A bit of wasabi is fine too. - Really?

1829
01:04:55,737 --> 01:04:59,247
(Mixing it up with a bit of wasabi)

1830
01:04:59,907 --> 01:05:01,677
This just looks amazing.

1831
01:05:02,017 --> 01:05:03,217
My gosh.

1832
01:05:03,687 --> 01:05:04,687
I feel really hungry all of a sudden.

1833
01:05:04,688 --> 01:05:05,847
I'll serve you the perilla leaves.

1834
01:05:06,317 --> 01:05:07,386
- This is the yellowtail? - Right.

1835
01:05:07,387 --> 01:05:08,517
(He starts with the yellowtail.)

1836
01:05:09,117 --> 01:05:10,586
Make a big dip into the makjang.

1837
01:05:10,587 --> 01:05:11,657
(Yellowtail)

1838
01:05:16,597 --> 01:05:18,567
(Garlic, pepper)

1839
01:05:18,897 --> 01:05:20,666
(Wrapped together...)

1840
01:05:20,667 --> 01:05:22,097
(to complete the yellowtail wrap)

1841
01:05:31,447 --> 01:05:33,776
- What would you recommend? - I'll recommend the so-iuy mullet.

1842
01:05:33,777 --> 01:05:35,716
- The one furthest away. - Right.

1843
01:05:35,717 --> 01:05:36,816
Take three pieces at once.

1844
01:05:36,817 --> 01:05:39,217
I'm sorry, but could I listen to their explanation?

1845
01:05:39,487 --> 01:05:41,357
I want to hear from the expert.

1846
01:05:42,457 --> 01:05:43,517
Around three pieces?

1847
01:05:44,457 --> 01:05:46,326
Three pieces of this? Did I do well?

1848
01:05:46,327 --> 01:05:47,627
- Three pieces will be just right. - Right.

1849
01:05:47,927 --> 01:05:48,996
Garlic and pepper.

1850
01:05:48,997 --> 01:05:50,766
I think you should add a lot of it.

1851
01:05:50,767 --> 01:05:52,027
- Like this? - Yes.

1852
01:05:52,927 --> 01:05:55,997
It's because of the vinegar gochujang.

1853
01:05:56,067 --> 01:05:57,567
This is amazing. Should I eat it like this?

1854
01:05:57,707 --> 01:05:59,567
- Enjoy. - Just one perilla leaf?

1855
01:06:00,977 --> 01:06:03,607
(Eating the wrap while looking toward them)

1856
01:06:05,407 --> 01:06:06,507
(I love this.)

1857
01:06:08,677 --> 01:06:10,486
(Smacking each other's hands out of joy)

1858
01:06:10,487 --> 01:06:11,487
My gosh.

1859
01:06:11,488 --> 01:06:13,217
- I'm ready for the quiz. - This is it.

1860
01:06:14,157 --> 01:06:16,486
The makjang ends everything.

1861
01:06:16,487 --> 01:06:17,487
(The complete version of ssamjang, makjang)

1862
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,827
I'm being honest.

1863
01:06:19,687 --> 01:06:21,527
You won't get sick of this even after three plates.

1864
01:06:21,657 --> 01:06:23,556
You won't stop eating because of the sauce.

1865
01:06:23,557 --> 01:06:25,226
Right.

1866
01:06:25,227 --> 01:06:27,867
The food just sticks to your mouth.

1867
01:06:28,397 --> 01:06:29,497
I've never had this before.

1868
01:06:30,037 --> 01:06:31,336
What have I been eating all my life?

1869
01:06:31,337 --> 01:06:33,606
- This is just amazing. - Tae Hyun.

1870
01:06:33,607 --> 01:06:35,206
- I can't believe this. - This just feels...

1871
01:06:35,207 --> 01:06:37,877
completely different.

1872
01:06:38,307 --> 01:06:39,377
Hold on.

1873
01:06:39,907 --> 01:06:41,677
Was Tae Hyun someone that ate this well?

1874
01:06:41,917 --> 01:06:43,017
- Gosh, Tae Hyun. - Gosh.

1875
01:06:45,647 --> 01:06:48,086
The raw fish is out. Can we start with the quiz?

1876
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,217
Please wait for a moment.

1877
01:06:49,457 --> 01:06:51,756
- Please wait for a moment. - You might finish all of it.

1878
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:52,887
- Hold on. - No.

1879
01:06:54,357 --> 01:06:56,396
I should've just followed Dong Hyun.

1880
01:06:56,397 --> 01:06:58,096
I should've waited for this.

1881
01:06:58,097 --> 01:07:00,167
- The yellowtail. - This place is amazing.

1882
01:07:00,567 --> 01:07:01,767
Right.

1883
01:07:02,697 --> 01:07:04,467
(Shoving in)

1884
01:07:05,237 --> 01:07:08,037
(Feeling upset)

1885
01:07:08,537 --> 01:07:10,547
(Gosh, it's good.)

1886
01:07:10,877 --> 01:07:13,377
(He's so annoying.)

1887
01:07:13,607 --> 01:07:15,817
I think the so-iuy mullet is the best for me.

1888
01:07:16,617 --> 01:07:17,947
We should leave some for them.

1889
01:07:18,047 --> 01:07:19,047
What?

1890
01:07:19,387 --> 01:07:22,886
The so-iuy mullet is firm while being tender.

1891
01:07:22,887 --> 01:07:25,087
There are around four pieces of the so-iuy mullet left.

1892
01:07:25,627 --> 01:07:27,197
I'll leave the so-iuy mullet.

1893
01:07:28,397 --> 01:07:30,727
What's this cute one?

1894
01:07:31,267 --> 01:07:32,726
What's this cute one?

1895
01:07:32,727 --> 01:07:34,037
(Plump)

1896
01:07:35,497 --> 01:07:37,907
(Steamed for around 20 minutes in the steamer...)

1897
01:07:38,837 --> 01:07:41,176
(and placed on top of the water parsley)

1898
01:07:41,177 --> 01:07:42,476
(Plump steamed whole cuttlefish)

1899
01:07:42,477 --> 01:07:43,577
It's so cute.

1900
01:07:44,677 --> 01:07:47,647
- It looks really plump. - You can have the cuttlefish...

1901
01:07:48,817 --> 01:07:50,717
with the makjang.

1902
01:07:51,047 --> 01:07:53,016
It will somewhat taste like sundae.

1903
01:07:53,017 --> 01:07:54,657
The innards will taste nice and savory.

1904
01:07:54,717 --> 01:07:56,687
- The black part? - I love the innards.

1905
01:07:57,387 --> 01:07:58,586
Gosh, look at the ink.

1906
01:07:58,587 --> 01:07:59,686
(Amazed)

1907
01:07:59,687 --> 01:08:02,327
Who ordered the cuttlefish? This is just amazing.

1908
01:08:02,497 --> 01:08:03,597
How is this eaten?

1909
01:08:04,067 --> 01:08:05,067
You can have it with the water parsley...
and the vinegar gochujang.

1910
01:08:06,068 --> 01:08:07,336
I think this will be amazing too.

1911
01:08:07,337 --> 01:08:09,196
I enjoy having this as a wrap with some doenjang.

1912
01:08:09,197 --> 01:08:11,166
I'm going to make a wrap with this. This can't be true.

1913
01:08:11,167 --> 01:08:13,337
The perilla leaf works with everything.

1914
01:08:13,607 --> 01:08:15,276
The perilla leaf is an all-rounder.

1915
01:08:15,277 --> 01:08:16,776
(Topping the all-rounder perilla leaf with water parsley, )

1916
01:08:16,777 --> 01:08:18,246
(cuttlefish, and makjang!)

1917
01:08:18,247 --> 01:08:20,746
(Taking a big bite)

1918
01:08:20,747 --> 01:08:22,617
Why is it so thick? Can this be eaten?

1919
01:08:22,847 --> 01:08:24,216
This is the good part.

1920
01:08:24,217 --> 01:08:26,316
- The ink is good? - That's the best part.

1921
01:08:26,317 --> 01:08:27,856
- This is eaten too? - Of course.

1922
01:08:27,857 --> 01:08:28,957
I didn't know.

1923
01:08:29,557 --> 01:08:31,126
(Annoyed)

1924
01:08:31,127 --> 01:08:32,857
Do I eat it with vinegar gochujang?

1925
01:08:32,887 --> 01:08:33,956
This one?

1926
01:08:33,957 --> 01:08:35,056
Like this?

1927
01:08:35,057 --> 01:08:36,796
- You can eat it as it is. - Add water parsley too.

1928
01:08:36,797 --> 01:08:38,227
It's my first time eating it.

1929
01:08:39,697 --> 01:08:40,966
(After preparing himself, )

1930
01:08:40,967 --> 01:08:44,507
(he shoves it into his mouth.)

1931
01:08:45,137 --> 01:08:46,837
(Oh, my!)

1932
01:08:48,877 --> 01:08:51,877
Water parsley gives the food a kick. I love water parsley.

1933
01:08:52,647 --> 01:08:55,447
(Lee Da Ho, the hungry man who retired a number in KBO)

1934
01:08:55,617 --> 01:08:57,446
- Give them a question. - Shall we move on to a quiz?

1935
01:08:57,447 --> 01:08:59,447
- Give us a question. - Okay.

1936
01:09:00,187 --> 01:09:01,956
It's much plumper than regular squid.

1937
01:09:01,957 --> 01:09:03,116
Some parts are tender...

1938
01:09:03,117 --> 01:09:05,557
while other parts are chewy. It's so tasty.

1939
01:09:05,587 --> 01:09:07,396
I'm sorry, but when will we solve a question?

1940
01:09:07,397 --> 01:09:08,826
- Now! - Now?

1941
01:09:08,827 --> 01:09:10,097
- Now! - Okay.

1942
01:09:10,867 --> 01:09:12,327
Here comes a quiz for the two of you.

1943
01:09:13,097 --> 01:09:15,536
In the 70s, many songs were banned...

1944
01:09:15,537 --> 01:09:18,037
simply because they didn't adhere...

1945
01:09:18,067 --> 01:09:21,077
to the societal norms.

1946
01:09:21,577 --> 01:09:24,947
Among them, "Farewell of Midnight" by Bae Ho was banned...

1947
01:09:25,447 --> 01:09:28,446
because it was about breaking up at the curfew time.

1948
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,577
I see.

1949
01:09:29,717 --> 01:09:30,886
In that case,

1950
01:09:30,887 --> 01:09:33,146
why did "Why Do You Call Me?" by Song Chang Sick become...

1951
01:09:33,147 --> 01:09:34,787
a banned song?

1952
01:09:36,387 --> 01:09:38,086
- I can't leave any behind. - Let me answer.

1953
01:09:38,087 --> 01:09:39,627
- Go ahead. - It was about calling at night.

1954
01:09:40,157 --> 01:09:42,157
- "Why do you call me?" - Incorrect.

1955
01:09:43,757 --> 01:09:45,596
Tae Hyun's mouth turned black.

1956
01:09:45,597 --> 01:09:47,267
Tae Hyun, your mouth turned black.

1957
01:09:47,397 --> 01:09:48,496
Tae Hyun.

1958
01:09:48,497 --> 01:09:49,937
You ate so much.

1959
01:09:50,067 --> 01:09:51,067
All right.

1960
01:09:51,967 --> 01:09:53,736
Let me answer. It was about calling someone who was leaving.

1961
01:09:53,737 --> 01:09:54,976
(Answer: It was about calling someone who was leaving.)

1962
01:09:54,977 --> 01:09:56,007
Incorrect.

1963
01:09:56,337 --> 01:09:57,646
Why do you call me?

1964
01:09:57,647 --> 01:09:58,707
How does the song go?

1965
01:09:58,907 --> 01:10:00,647
I don't know the song.

1966
01:10:02,017 --> 01:10:03,247
Why do you call me?

1967
01:10:03,547 --> 01:10:04,716
- Shall I play it once? - Please play it once.

1968
01:10:04,717 --> 01:10:06,186
- That's a good idea. - Good. I'll answer right away.

1969
01:10:06,187 --> 01:10:09,516
(Why do you call me?)

1970
01:10:09,517 --> 01:10:13,186
(I'm turning around to leave)

1971
01:10:13,187 --> 01:10:14,657
Let me answer. It's a casual tone.

1972
01:10:15,027 --> 01:10:16,156
- Correct. - Yes!

1973
01:10:16,157 --> 01:10:17,367
(Yes!)

1974
01:10:18,327 --> 01:10:20,526
- It's a casual tone. - I was going to say that.

1975
01:10:20,527 --> 01:10:21,896
I thought, "Could that be it?"

1976
01:10:21,897 --> 01:10:23,537
- Everything is tasty. - What did you say was tasty?

1977
01:10:23,567 --> 01:10:24,636
Eat as much as you want.

1978
01:10:24,637 --> 01:10:25,706
"Could that be it?"

1979
01:10:25,707 --> 01:10:27,066
(It's too bad.)

1980
01:10:27,067 --> 01:10:28,776
It was banned due to the casual tone.

1981
01:10:28,777 --> 01:10:31,307
- Unbelievable. - The lyrics are in a casual tone.

1982
01:10:31,907 --> 01:10:34,216
You eat these with garlic, okay?

1983
01:10:34,217 --> 01:10:35,316
My goodness.

1984
01:10:35,317 --> 01:10:36,747
- You showed me repeatedly earlier. - Okay.

1985
01:10:37,177 --> 01:10:39,687
(Laughing)

1986
01:10:42,517 --> 01:10:43,656
(He adds three pieces of sashimi, vinegar gochujang, )

1987
01:10:43,657 --> 01:10:44,956
You should add this.

1988
01:10:44,957 --> 01:10:46,226
(and makjang as he has seen earlier.)

1989
01:10:46,227 --> 01:10:47,957
You know, when you're on a show...

1990
01:10:48,197 --> 01:10:50,997
When you eat a wrap, you should look to the left first.

1991
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:53,766
- Shall I look to the left? - Look to the left.

1992
01:10:53,767 --> 01:10:55,967
- He's so scary. - He made a nice wrap.

1993
01:10:57,567 --> 01:10:59,007
(He shyly takes a bite.)

1994
01:11:01,937 --> 01:11:03,876
You should eat comfortably.

1995
01:11:03,877 --> 01:11:06,177
(The taste makes him clap.)

1996
01:11:06,607 --> 01:11:07,746
It's so tasty.

1997
01:11:07,747 --> 01:11:09,317
- You should eat this. - It's the best.

1998
01:11:09,347 --> 01:11:11,216
- The amount is so generous. - Thank you.

1999
01:11:11,217 --> 01:11:12,617
- You should try this. - Hey.

2000
01:11:12,917 --> 01:11:14,317
(Laughing)

2001
01:11:15,657 --> 01:11:17,627
- Would you give us three? - It's huge.

2002
01:11:18,887 --> 01:11:20,326
My hand is this big.

2003
01:11:20,327 --> 01:11:21,397
(The triploid oyster is as big as his palm.)

2004
01:11:22,097 --> 01:11:23,396
Let me sprinkle it.

2005
01:11:23,397 --> 01:11:25,427
(He knows how to eat.)

2006
01:11:26,097 --> 01:11:27,967
- Gosh, it's so big. - My goodness.

2007
01:11:28,397 --> 01:11:29,667
It's so fresh.

2008
01:11:29,967 --> 01:11:32,567
You should eat it with garlic and perilla leaf.

2009
01:11:33,267 --> 01:11:34,377
Is it tasty?

2010
01:11:36,007 --> 01:11:37,137
It's incredible.

2011
01:11:38,147 --> 01:11:40,576
They're making the eel soup with green onion kimchi.

2012
01:11:40,577 --> 01:11:41,717
My goodness.

2013
01:11:42,147 --> 01:11:44,486
One bunch of green onion kimchi got added.

2014
01:11:44,487 --> 01:11:47,787
(A heap of green onion kimchi gets added.)

2015
01:11:48,187 --> 01:11:51,227
(A spoonful of sauce for spiciness)

2016
01:11:51,427 --> 01:11:53,857
It's an unusual dish.

2017
01:11:55,657 --> 01:11:57,697
That must be the eel dish.

2018
01:11:58,427 --> 01:12:00,397
That must be the eel soup. The eel hot pot.

2019
01:12:01,237 --> 01:12:03,497
Saltwater eels are quite tender too.

2020
01:12:04,237 --> 01:12:06,006
Saltwater eels.

2021
01:12:06,007 --> 01:12:07,436
(Springtime health food, eel and green onion hot pot)

2022
01:12:07,437 --> 01:12:09,107
The soup must be very refreshing.

2023
01:12:10,707 --> 01:12:12,777
The taste must be deep.

2024
01:12:13,647 --> 01:12:15,046
It's like kimchi stew.

2025
01:12:15,047 --> 01:12:17,176
- It contains green onion kimchi. - Green onion kimchi.

2026
01:12:17,177 --> 01:12:19,987
Not much sauce got added. Only green onion kimchi got added.

2027
01:12:20,687 --> 01:12:21,757
May we eat it?

2028
01:12:21,917 --> 01:12:23,817
I'll scoop it out.

2029
01:12:24,487 --> 01:12:26,186
- Thank you. - It's for you.

2030
01:12:26,187 --> 01:12:28,157
(The spicy smell makes him lose his mind.)

2031
01:12:28,557 --> 01:12:30,297
Gosh, that dish is...

2032
01:12:36,667 --> 01:12:38,436
(A generous serving)

2033
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:39,737
Let's eat first.

2034
01:12:39,837 --> 01:12:41,136
I want the soup.

2035
01:12:41,137 --> 01:12:42,537
- Green onion kimchi. - Soup.

2036
01:12:43,137 --> 01:12:44,577
(A lot of eels)

2037
01:12:45,607 --> 01:12:46,906
It contains green onion kimchi.

2038
01:12:46,907 --> 01:12:49,016
That's why it tastes like kimchi stew.

2039
01:12:49,017 --> 01:12:50,316
- May I smell it? - Sure.

2040
01:12:50,317 --> 01:12:52,247
- It smells like kimchi stew. - I know.

2041
01:12:52,717 --> 01:12:55,316
- But it's green onion kimchi stew, - You're right.

2042
01:12:55,317 --> 01:12:57,157
- not regular kimchi stew. - It smells like green onion kimchi.

2043
01:12:57,357 --> 01:13:00,187
(Blowing on the food)

2044
01:13:06,597 --> 01:13:09,437
It's the taste I haven't had before.

2045
01:13:12,507 --> 01:13:13,807
It's hot.

2046
01:13:14,377 --> 01:13:16,007
(My goodness)

2047
01:13:16,537 --> 01:13:18,407
Look at his eyebrows.

2048
01:13:18,677 --> 01:13:19,776
His eyebrows were like this.

2049
01:13:19,777 --> 01:13:21,877
I want to iron Dong Hyun's eyebrows.

2050
01:13:23,547 --> 01:13:25,487
I'll eat this nonstop.

2051
01:13:25,987 --> 01:13:29,416
Grilled eels were added to the hot pot.

2052
01:13:29,417 --> 01:13:31,527
- The smoky flavor makes it better. - Yes.

2053
01:13:32,387 --> 01:13:34,156
- That explains the smell. - "What's up with the smoky flavor?"

2054
01:13:34,157 --> 01:13:35,997
And thanks to the grilling part,

2055
01:13:36,027 --> 01:13:38,796
eels don't fall apart. They're firm.

2056
01:13:38,797 --> 01:13:39,927
(The grilling process gave the eels the smoky flavor and firm texture.)

2057
01:13:42,467 --> 01:13:43,537
You know,

2058
01:13:43,637 --> 01:13:46,006
people who work in Eulji-ro...

2059
01:13:46,007 --> 01:13:48,137
should come here after work on a cold day like today.

2060
01:13:48,977 --> 01:13:50,537
- If they come here... - Yes.

2061
01:13:50,777 --> 01:13:53,446
And eat this with soju, it'll be the best.

2062
01:13:53,447 --> 01:13:56,146
(A sip of the hot soup will melt away the exhaustion.)

2063
01:13:56,147 --> 01:13:58,786
It'll melt away the exhaustion.

2064
01:13:58,787 --> 01:14:00,187
It'll be the best dish in winter.

2065
01:14:00,747 --> 01:14:04,257
It's perfect that the hot pot got served last.

2066
01:14:04,587 --> 01:14:06,227
I want to go and eat ramyeon.

2067
01:14:08,097 --> 01:14:10,556
This is worth rock-paper-scissors. Leave some behind.

2068
01:14:10,557 --> 01:14:12,966
- Okay. - I'll leave some eels here.

2069
01:14:12,967 --> 01:14:14,496
After eating the green onion and eel together,

2070
01:14:14,497 --> 01:14:15,767
you should drink a lot of soup.

2071
01:14:16,097 --> 01:14:17,197
Seriously.

2072
01:14:20,367 --> 01:14:22,436
- We can play Minus One with Dae Ho. - Right.

2073
01:14:22,437 --> 01:14:23,606
It's Minus One.

2074
01:14:23,607 --> 01:14:25,007
- Minus One? Okay. - Yes.

2075
01:14:25,907 --> 01:14:28,576
Don't play the same hand.

2076
01:14:28,577 --> 01:14:29,676
(Running a simulation)

2077
01:14:29,677 --> 01:14:31,686
What are you calculating? It's Minus One.

2078
01:14:31,687 --> 01:14:32,847
(Laughing)

2079
01:14:33,047 --> 01:14:35,617
(There's tension between the two.)

2080
01:14:36,017 --> 01:14:38,886
The gold medalists will have a match...

2081
01:14:38,887 --> 01:14:40,456
- of Minus One. - My goodness.

2082
01:14:40,457 --> 01:14:44,427
What kind of a sword will Sang Uk draw?

2083
01:14:44,697 --> 01:14:46,326
- Let's look forward to it. - Rock-paper-scissors,

2084
01:14:46,327 --> 01:14:48,067
minus one. It'll go like that.

2085
01:14:48,437 --> 01:14:49,566
- My goodness. - Okay. That's good.

2086
01:14:49,567 --> 01:14:52,737
- All right. - Dae Ho got played already.

2087
01:14:53,107 --> 01:14:55,137
- Shall we begin? - Sang Uk saw the hands.

2088
01:14:55,507 --> 01:14:57,706
Put your hands up. Are you ready?

2089
01:14:57,707 --> 01:14:59,377
Rock-paper-scissors,

2090
01:15:01,447 --> 01:15:02,647
minus one.

2091
01:15:04,447 --> 01:15:06,647
(He makes a fist!)

2092
01:15:07,247 --> 01:15:09,517
He drew the wrong sword.

2093
01:15:10,057 --> 01:15:12,087
It should've been a different sword.

2094
01:15:12,187 --> 01:15:14,186
Hold it well. It's hot.

2095
01:15:14,187 --> 01:15:16,127
(Enjoy the hot pot of victory.)

2096
01:15:17,927 --> 01:15:20,397
(He calmly gets ready to eat.)

2097
01:15:21,697 --> 01:15:23,537
Let's eat the hot pot.

2098
01:15:23,867 --> 01:15:24,966
(He gets some soup in the spoon.)

2099
01:15:24,967 --> 01:15:26,137
He made sure it didn't fall down.

2100
01:15:30,237 --> 01:15:31,406
That's how he eats.

2101
01:15:31,407 --> 01:15:34,147
(He enjoys the delicious spoonful.)

2102
01:15:35,417 --> 01:15:38,917
(Happy)

2103
01:15:39,987 --> 01:15:41,216
The soup is amazing, right?

2104
01:15:41,217 --> 01:15:42,787
(Dae Ho falls in love with the rich soup.)

2105
01:15:43,417 --> 01:15:45,927
- The grilled eels are chewy. - Yes.

2106
01:15:46,987 --> 01:15:48,857
The eels don't fall apart in the soup.

2107
01:15:48,957 --> 01:15:50,097
I guess that's why they grill the eels.

2108
01:15:50,257 --> 01:15:51,397
They don't fall apart.

2109
01:15:52,527 --> 01:15:54,466
- Sang Uk, make an acrostic poem. - That's a good idea.

2110
01:15:54,467 --> 01:15:56,836
- I'm bad with acrostic poems. - It's okay.

2111
01:15:56,837 --> 01:15:59,006
How about a poem about the low-cost bar?

2112
01:15:59,007 --> 01:16:00,606
- The low-cost bar. - The low-cost bar.

2113
01:16:00,607 --> 01:16:02,506
- The letters are L, C, and B. - Hurry up and think of something.

2114
01:16:02,507 --> 01:16:03,507
(Thinking)

2115
01:16:03,508 --> 01:16:04,607
L.

2116
01:16:06,647 --> 01:16:07,847
Low-cost bar.

2117
01:16:09,147 --> 01:16:10,217
C.

2118
01:16:11,587 --> 01:16:12,887
Come when it rains.

2119
01:16:14,657 --> 01:16:15,717
B.

2120
01:16:18,787 --> 01:16:21,296
Seriously, I can't do this.

2121
01:16:21,297 --> 01:16:23,457
"Best place is here." You should've said that.

2122
01:16:23,897 --> 01:16:25,227
- It's a home run! - You're right.

2123
01:16:25,327 --> 01:16:26,927
Success!

2124
01:16:27,227 --> 01:16:29,237
(Laughing)

2125
01:16:29,397 --> 01:16:30,937
- I did it. - Thank you.

2126
01:16:31,537 --> 01:16:32,706
Seriously.

2127
01:16:32,707 --> 01:16:34,776
- He didn't disappoint. - Heo Kyeong Hwan will love it.

2128
01:16:34,777 --> 01:16:37,536
"Best place is here."

2129
01:16:37,537 --> 01:16:39,406
You entered when he faced a crisis...

2130
01:16:39,407 --> 01:16:40,706
- and hit a home run. - I saved him.

2131
01:16:40,707 --> 01:16:41,816
What a collaboration.

2132
01:16:41,817 --> 01:16:42,916
- They're a team. - A collaboration.

2133
01:16:42,917 --> 01:16:44,616
They're a true team.

2134
01:16:44,617 --> 01:16:45,816
He motivated me.

2135
01:16:45,817 --> 01:16:46,817
(Stacking)

2136
01:16:47,147 --> 01:16:48,317
No way.

2137
01:16:51,127 --> 01:16:52,187
Sang Uk.

2138
01:16:52,587 --> 01:16:53,987
It's the best taste.

2139
01:16:54,287 --> 01:16:55,427
How does it taste?

2140
01:16:56,357 --> 01:16:57,796
It's so good.

2141
01:16:57,797 --> 01:16:58,997
(Carefree)

2142
01:16:59,027 --> 01:17:00,426
The sea squirt too.

2143
01:17:00,427 --> 01:17:02,336
- I've never had such a taste. - I've never had such a taste.

2144
01:17:02,337 --> 01:17:03,696
Seriously,

2145
01:17:03,697 --> 01:17:06,307
the ingredients account for 90 percent of the taste.

2146
01:17:06,337 --> 01:17:08,336
- It was the best. - It was tasty.

2147
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:09,776
You know,

2148
01:17:09,777 --> 01:17:11,276
I'm in a good mood...

2149
01:17:11,277 --> 01:17:12,746
- because it's tasty and healthy. - Really?

2150
01:17:12,747 --> 01:17:14,076
- What? Yes. - Really?

2151
01:17:14,077 --> 01:17:15,417
Then you should pay.

2152
01:17:15,747 --> 01:17:18,047
I'll be in a better mood if I don't pay.

2153
01:17:18,517 --> 01:17:20,846
If it's for a happy occasion, I'll pay gladly.

2154
01:17:20,847 --> 01:17:22,417
But this is a penalty.

2155
01:17:22,487 --> 01:17:23,856
Dong Hyun,

2156
01:17:23,857 --> 01:17:26,326
- the total is 268 dollars. - My goodness.

2157
01:17:26,327 --> 01:17:27,696
- It's really inexpensive. - Seriously.

2158
01:17:27,697 --> 01:17:28,756
- We ate so much. - How nice.

2159
01:17:28,757 --> 01:17:30,226
- You ordered many dishes. - We ate a lot.

2160
01:17:30,227 --> 01:17:31,666
- We ate excessively. - You know,

2161
01:17:31,667 --> 01:17:33,666
- we had our fill. - We ate excessively.

2162
01:17:33,667 --> 01:17:35,166
Please let it be something I know.

2163
01:17:35,167 --> 01:17:37,937
Here comes the quiz.

2164
01:17:38,537 --> 01:17:41,306
"Jasaneobo," a book that was written by Chong Yak Chon,

2165
01:17:41,307 --> 01:17:44,077
gave a detailed explanation on various types of fish.

2166
01:17:44,877 --> 01:17:48,217
The following is an excerpt from "Jasaneobo."

2167
01:17:48,777 --> 01:17:52,147
- "Its body is like a lotus leaf." - A lotus leaf.

2168
01:17:52,217 --> 01:17:54,147
"The color is dark red."

2169
01:17:54,657 --> 01:17:57,657
"Its nose is located on its head."

2170
01:17:58,587 --> 01:18:01,197
"The bottom is big and pointy."

2171
01:18:02,297 --> 01:18:04,197
"Its mouth is under the nose."

2172
01:18:04,327 --> 01:18:07,097
"Between the head and belly lies a straight mouth."

2173
01:18:07,837 --> 01:18:10,067
"Its tail resembles that of a pig."

2174
01:18:10,637 --> 01:18:11,766
We're set.

2175
01:18:11,767 --> 01:18:13,806
- Okay. - What is this fish?

2176
01:18:13,807 --> 01:18:14,976
- We're set. - Go ahead.

2177
01:18:14,977 --> 01:18:16,606
Shall I give you my guess? It's 1 of the 2.

2178
01:18:16,607 --> 01:18:18,347
- Stingray. - Okay. What's your guess?

2179
01:18:18,377 --> 01:18:20,506
- Stingray. - Right? Skate or stingray.

2180
01:18:20,507 --> 01:18:21,677
Skate?

2181
01:18:22,117 --> 01:18:23,977
- I think it's skate. - Skate?

2182
01:18:24,447 --> 01:18:26,487
They wouldn't give such an easy question.

2183
01:18:27,417 --> 01:18:29,016
Tae Hyun, I've never seen a skate.

2184
01:18:29,017 --> 01:18:30,257
Does it look like a stingray?

2185
01:18:30,687 --> 01:18:34,226
I've only seen the smelly dish.

2186
01:18:34,227 --> 01:18:35,256
(I've only seen it on a plate.)

2187
01:18:35,257 --> 01:18:37,696
- I've only seen the slices. - Here's what I think.

2188
01:18:37,697 --> 01:18:39,766
It isn't halibut, right?

2189
01:18:39,767 --> 01:18:41,396
- I had that thought too. - Halibut.

2190
01:18:41,397 --> 01:18:42,566
- I had that thought. - But its tail...

2191
01:18:42,567 --> 01:18:44,297
- resembles that of a pig. - That's right.

2192
01:18:44,837 --> 01:18:47,436
That's right. The book also said that its mouth was on the bottom.

2193
01:18:47,437 --> 01:18:48,606
- That's right. - So it can't be a halibut.

2194
01:18:48,607 --> 01:18:50,077
But hear me out, Tae Hyun.

2195
01:18:50,707 --> 01:18:52,246
I know about "Jasaneobo."

2196
01:18:52,247 --> 01:18:54,147
The book talks about different types of fish.

2197
01:18:54,447 --> 01:18:55,946
But I don't think stingray is one of them.

2198
01:18:55,947 --> 01:18:58,386
- I think it's skate. - My goodness.

2199
01:18:58,387 --> 01:19:00,117
I bet the author saw skate.

2200
01:19:00,847 --> 01:19:02,316
(Let me think.)

2201
01:19:02,317 --> 01:19:03,416
- All right. - Okay.

2202
01:19:03,417 --> 01:19:04,587
- I made up my mind. - What is it?

2203
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:08,157
I'll pay if the answer is incorrect.

2204
01:19:08,327 --> 01:19:09,327
- Why? - Okay.

2205
01:19:09,527 --> 01:19:11,056
- Really? - He's so cool.

2206
01:19:11,057 --> 01:19:13,666
- I have an idea. - I'm so jealous.

2207
01:19:13,667 --> 01:19:14,797
You know,

2208
01:19:15,267 --> 01:19:19,537
I can clearly picture its smiley face...

2209
01:19:19,837 --> 01:19:21,506
- on the bottom side. - That's right.

2210
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:23,107
- It's very cute. - Yes.

2211
01:19:23,237 --> 01:19:26,107
But I don't exactly know..

2212
01:19:26,577 --> 01:19:28,717
- what a skate looks like. - Okay.

2213
01:19:29,047 --> 01:19:31,847
But a skate looks similar.

2214
01:19:32,317 --> 01:19:34,716
- Their mouths look like this. - That's right.

2215
01:19:34,717 --> 01:19:37,316
- That's right. - It looks like they're smiling.

2216
01:19:37,317 --> 01:19:38,426
- It's a baby face. A human face. - At the corners,

2217
01:19:38,427 --> 01:19:40,386
there are deep wrinkles.

2218
01:19:40,387 --> 01:19:41,527
It's a human face.

2219
01:19:42,297 --> 01:19:46,327
Seriously, I have this thought. If I say, "Stingray,"

2220
01:19:46,467 --> 01:19:48,537
he'll shout, "Correct."

2221
01:19:48,767 --> 01:19:50,436
- I see. - I can feel it.

2222
01:19:50,437 --> 01:19:52,237
- Can you feel it? - Yes, I can feel it.

2223
01:19:52,667 --> 01:19:54,506
- A hunch. - But I was wrong each time.

2224
01:19:54,507 --> 01:19:55,677
I don't know what to do.

2225
01:19:56,207 --> 01:19:57,606
- "Your answer is incorrect." - "Incorrect."

2226
01:19:57,607 --> 01:19:59,877
- I had that happen... - "Your answer is..."

2227
01:19:59,977 --> 01:20:01,047
- so many times. - "incorrect."

2228
01:20:01,107 --> 01:20:02,746
- Tae Hyun, go with your hunch. - Really?

2229
01:20:02,747 --> 01:20:03,946
All right. Let me answer.

2230
01:20:03,947 --> 01:20:05,416
- Won't you go with skate? - No.

2231
01:20:05,417 --> 01:20:06,686
Let me answer. Stingray.

2232
01:20:06,687 --> 01:20:07,916
(Answer: Stingray)

2233
01:20:07,917 --> 01:20:09,086
That's your answer, right?

2234
01:20:09,087 --> 01:20:10,187
- My goodness. - Stingray.

2235
01:20:10,657 --> 01:20:12,256
- Stingray. - I'm so curious.

2236
01:20:12,257 --> 01:20:13,487
(If it's correct, we'll pay.)

2237
01:20:14,027 --> 01:20:15,126
(It's time to break the cycle of incorrect answers.)

2238
01:20:15,127 --> 01:20:16,997
Hold on.

2239
01:20:17,557 --> 01:20:18,696
You don't regret it, right?

2240
01:20:18,697 --> 01:20:19,966
(Answer: Stingray)

2241
01:20:19,967 --> 01:20:22,297
- Incorrect. - See?

2242
01:20:22,667 --> 01:20:23,867
Tae Hyun.

2243
01:20:24,337 --> 01:20:25,366
Incorrect.

2244
01:20:25,367 --> 01:20:26,466
(Cheering)

2245
01:20:26,467 --> 01:20:28,376
- No way. It's incorrect. - Tae Hyun.

2246
01:20:28,377 --> 01:20:30,376
- I guess it's skate. - It's skate.

2247
01:20:30,377 --> 01:20:31,707
It's skate.

2248
01:20:32,147 --> 01:20:33,446
I failed again.

2249
01:20:33,447 --> 01:20:35,317
- How annoying. - It has to be skate.

2250
01:20:35,847 --> 01:20:37,647
- It has to be skate. - The answer is...

2251
01:20:38,487 --> 01:20:39,817
I hope it isn't skate either.

2252
01:20:39,987 --> 01:20:41,716
- It's skate. - Of course, it's skate.

2253
01:20:41,717 --> 01:20:43,857
- Skate is in "Jasaneobo." - It's skate.

2254
01:20:44,417 --> 01:20:46,986
"Jasaneobo" was written on Heuksan Island.

2255
01:20:46,987 --> 01:20:48,356
- Heuksan Island. - That's right.

2256
01:20:48,357 --> 01:20:50,096
- Heuksan Island. - Yes.

2257
01:20:50,097 --> 01:20:52,067
I guess it's different from a stingray.

2258
01:20:52,997 --> 01:20:54,766
(A nose on the head, )

2259
01:20:54,767 --> 01:20:56,366
(a straight mouth between the head and the belly, )

2260
01:20:56,367 --> 01:20:58,066
(a body like a lotus leaf, )

2261
01:20:58,067 --> 01:20:59,667
(and rough spikes on the tail)

2262
01:20:59,967 --> 01:21:01,977
I can't seem to break that cycle.

2263
01:21:02,037 --> 01:21:05,106
I hoped stingray would be correct so that I could break that cycle.

2264
01:21:05,107 --> 01:21:06,447
I knew it was incorrect.

2265
01:21:06,847 --> 01:21:08,076
I should've pushed for a different answer.

2266
01:21:08,077 --> 01:21:11,017
If you hadn't offered to pay, I would've insisted on skate.

2267
01:21:12,217 --> 01:21:14,956
Sometimes, the question is simple.

2268
01:21:14,957 --> 01:21:16,517
Other times, it's complicated.

2269
01:21:16,857 --> 01:21:18,026
(Total: 268 dollars)

2270
01:21:18,027 --> 01:21:19,027
Thank you.
(Tae Hyun makes the payment.)

2271
01:21:20,028 --> 01:21:21,126
Thank you for the food.

2272
01:21:21,127 --> 01:21:22,297
Thank you, Director.

2273
01:21:23,057 --> 01:21:24,127
How upsetting.

2274
01:21:26,927 --> 01:21:29,137
Seriously. My goodness.

2275
01:21:30,637 --> 01:21:32,707
All right. The second one.

2276
01:21:32,867 --> 01:21:34,006
- All right. - All right.

2277
01:21:34,007 --> 01:21:35,807
- Let's go. - Let's go to the last one.

2278
01:21:35,877 --> 01:21:38,146
How will it be? All other places are closed.

2279
01:21:38,147 --> 01:21:39,306
(They enter a homely and empty alley.)

2280
01:21:39,307 --> 01:21:41,206
Tae Hyun, even if you weren't on a show,

2281
01:21:41,207 --> 01:21:44,147
it'd be reassuring to walk with these four juniors.

2282
01:21:44,247 --> 01:21:45,316
Seriously.

2283
01:21:45,317 --> 01:21:47,487
- I love this. - The national athletes.

2284
01:21:47,617 --> 01:21:51,157
No matter who picks a fight, I'll be confident.

2285
01:21:51,727 --> 01:21:53,026
- Hello. - Hello.

2286
01:21:53,027 --> 01:21:54,326
- Is this the place? - What's this?

2287
01:21:54,327 --> 01:21:55,757
- It's an actual food tent. - Hello.

2288
01:21:55,997 --> 01:21:57,726
Maybe we should have a toast first.

2289
01:21:57,727 --> 01:21:59,797
- Come over here. - My goodness.

2290
01:22:00,127 --> 01:22:01,196
- Hello. - Hello.

2291
01:22:01,197 --> 01:22:02,937
- It'll be so tasty. - All right.

2292
01:22:05,037 --> 01:22:06,067
- What? - Really?

2293
01:22:06,337 --> 01:22:07,436
- Hey. - Hold on.

2294
01:22:07,437 --> 01:22:09,537
- What's this? - Hold on.

2295
01:22:10,277 --> 01:22:12,607
- What's this? - Is there only one table?

2296
01:22:15,017 --> 01:22:16,676
(There's no sign...)

2297
01:22:16,677 --> 01:22:20,417
(and the space is limited.)

2298
01:22:20,947 --> 01:22:24,657
(But the place is always bustling with customers.)

2299
01:22:25,227 --> 01:22:27,827
(Even Tzuyang visited the place.)

2300
01:22:29,127 --> 01:22:32,127
(Foodies acknowledge this street food place in Euljiro.)

2301
01:22:33,227 --> 01:22:36,467
(It's a small, but strong food tent that competes with taste alone.)

2302
01:22:37,097 --> 01:22:40,137
(Dinner Menu Recommendation 2: Street food)

2303
01:22:40,967 --> 01:22:42,706
- Look at the top. - It's game over, right?

2304
01:22:42,707 --> 01:22:43,707
A place like this...

2305
01:22:43,708 --> 01:22:45,676
- Looking at this... - It's bound to be tasty.

2306
01:22:45,677 --> 01:22:47,046
(It's bound to be tasty.)

2307
01:22:47,047 --> 01:22:48,947
The two of them must be sisters.

2308
01:22:49,247 --> 01:22:50,447
- You're right. - Yes, they're sisters.

2309
01:22:50,677 --> 01:22:52,187
- They're outside. - I saw them.

2310
01:22:52,847 --> 01:22:54,146
The owners who are sisters...

2311
01:22:54,147 --> 01:22:57,017
have run this place 24 hours a day for 30 years.

2312
01:22:57,417 --> 01:22:58,456
- What? - It never closes.

2313
01:22:58,457 --> 01:22:59,527
- Really? - Are you serious?

2314
01:23:00,187 --> 01:23:01,527
There's no sign.

2315
01:23:02,757 --> 01:23:04,897
- There's no price list either. - You're right.

2316
01:23:05,097 --> 01:23:06,097
(There's no price list.)

2317
01:23:06,098 --> 01:23:09,666
(All the customers are regulars anyway.)

2318
01:23:09,667 --> 01:23:11,706
People visit through word of mouth.

2319
01:23:11,707 --> 01:23:12,707
I see.

2320
01:23:12,708 --> 01:23:14,036
They're so cool.

2321
01:23:14,037 --> 01:23:15,436
- There's no sign. - That's right.

2322
01:23:15,437 --> 01:23:17,306
The toast is the most famous.

2323
01:23:17,307 --> 01:23:19,006
- We have to eat it. - We should order it first.

2324
01:23:19,007 --> 01:23:20,447
Will you eat a toast now?

2325
01:23:20,847 --> 01:23:22,376
Will you order a toast?

2326
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:24,576
- Yes. It'll be the beginning. - You have to eat a toast here.

2327
01:23:24,577 --> 01:23:26,217
- It's a must. - You know...

2328
01:23:26,547 --> 01:23:28,316
Would you make us a toast first?

2329
01:23:28,317 --> 01:23:29,856
- Okay. - Please make us a toast.

2330
01:23:29,857 --> 01:23:31,987
- We'll pick afterward. - "We'll pick afterward."

2331
01:23:32,287 --> 01:23:33,426
What's your favorite item?

2332
01:23:33,427 --> 01:23:35,396
I went through the menu.

2333
01:23:35,397 --> 01:23:36,796
I need to eat bibim guksu.

2334
01:23:36,797 --> 01:23:38,726
- Do you like noodles? - Yes, I like noodles.

2335
01:23:38,727 --> 01:23:40,496
I'll order ramyeon.

2336
01:23:40,497 --> 01:23:41,736
- Ramyeon. - I need to eat ramyeon.

2337
01:23:41,737 --> 01:23:43,236
- Ramyeon. - Please go ahead.

2338
01:23:43,237 --> 01:23:44,696
I have it. Yes.

2339
01:23:44,697 --> 01:23:46,737
I have a question.

2340
01:23:47,107 --> 01:23:49,306
You guys don't want to eat, right?

2341
01:23:49,307 --> 01:23:50,607
I want to eat ramyeon.

2342
01:23:51,477 --> 01:23:53,476
(I want to eat.)

2343
01:23:53,477 --> 01:23:55,447
As for me, I'm really full.

2344
01:23:55,747 --> 01:23:57,517
But I'd love to have a bite of the toast.

2345
01:23:57,877 --> 01:23:59,316
Their toast is the most famous.

2346
01:23:59,317 --> 01:24:00,546
I love such food.

2347
01:24:00,547 --> 01:24:01,556
(Tae Hyun can't believe it.)

2348
01:24:01,557 --> 01:24:02,557
If it's tasty...

2349
01:24:02,558 --> 01:24:03,686
It should contain a lot of sugar.

2350
01:24:03,687 --> 01:24:04,756
Ramyeon and guksu.

2351
01:24:04,757 --> 01:24:05,857
- Ma'am. - Yes?

2352
01:24:05,987 --> 01:24:09,097
We'll order 1 bibim guksu, 1 ramyeon,

2353
01:24:09,397 --> 01:24:11,897
1 chicken feet, and 1 stir-fried pork.

2354
01:24:12,227 --> 01:24:14,126
Kimchi fried rice caught my eyes.

2355
01:24:14,127 --> 01:24:15,436
(Kimchi fried rice)

2356
01:24:15,437 --> 01:24:17,437
Two cups of coffee. Iced coffee.

2357
01:24:17,737 --> 01:24:19,936
- Iced? - Yes. Please make it a bit sweet.

2358
01:24:19,937 --> 01:24:22,177
(Is that an order for two people?)

2359
01:24:24,137 --> 01:24:25,746
The sound tells me that the toast will be delicious.

2360
01:24:25,747 --> 01:24:26,947
It's the sound of the iron plate getting scraped.

2361
01:24:27,077 --> 01:24:28,516
I can smell the toast.

2362
01:24:28,517 --> 01:24:31,016
(The older sister)

2363
01:24:31,017 --> 01:24:32,686
- It smells amazing. - It's my favorite type of food.

2364
01:24:32,687 --> 01:24:37,257
(The eggs and bread get cooked and become golden.)

2365
01:24:40,287 --> 01:24:41,796
(Sugar)

2366
01:24:41,797 --> 01:24:44,526
(Sprinkling sugar)

2367
01:24:44,527 --> 01:24:46,496
(The older sister)

2368
01:24:46,497 --> 01:24:51,507
(The flipping skills show 30 years of experience.)

2369
01:24:52,537 --> 01:24:57,007
(She sprinkles sugar on the toast once more.)

2370
01:24:58,247 --> 01:25:02,577
(The first menu, toast)

2371
01:25:03,117 --> 01:25:04,477
Thank you.

2372
01:25:05,417 --> 01:25:07,416
(Amazed)

2373
01:25:07,417 --> 01:25:08,417
My goodness.

2374
01:25:08,857 --> 01:25:10,156
- I told you so. Sugar. - Look at this.

2375
01:25:10,157 --> 01:25:11,586
- It looks so pretty. - Hold on.

2376
01:25:11,587 --> 01:25:12,956
- All right. - Hold on.

2377
01:25:12,957 --> 01:25:14,156
Hold on.

2378
01:25:14,157 --> 01:25:15,996
If there hadn't been any sugar, I wouldn't have eaten it.

2379
01:25:15,997 --> 01:25:17,997
- But there's sugar. - There's sugar.

2380
01:25:18,027 --> 01:25:19,966
- Why would you eat it? - Shall we begin eating?

2381
01:25:19,967 --> 01:25:21,226
- Okay. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2382
01:25:21,227 --> 01:25:22,696
- Shall we begin eating? - Okay.

2383
01:25:22,697 --> 01:25:23,966
- Let's try it. - Please enjoy it.

2384
01:25:23,967 --> 01:25:25,766
- Gosh, it's so soft. - Hold on.

2385
01:25:25,767 --> 01:25:28,636
(Eating)

2386
01:25:28,637 --> 01:25:29,736
Leave a piece behind.

2387
01:25:29,737 --> 01:25:33,847
(They pay no attention to what the others are saying.)

2388
01:25:34,047 --> 01:25:35,176
- Hold on. - Give us a question.

2389
01:25:35,177 --> 01:25:36,446
- Hold on. Dae Ho. - Hold on.

2390
01:25:36,447 --> 01:25:37,716
- A question? That's so sudden. - This is...

2391
01:25:37,717 --> 01:25:39,586
Leave a piece behind.

2392
01:25:39,587 --> 01:25:41,046
- Leave a piece behind. - Come on.

2393
01:25:41,047 --> 01:25:42,286
- Seriously. - I don't need anything else.

2394
01:25:42,287 --> 01:25:43,786
- At the bar... - You'll get ketchup.

2395
01:25:43,787 --> 01:25:45,356
- At the low-cost bar... - Listen.

2396
01:25:45,357 --> 01:25:47,156
- At the low-cost bar, - We gave you guys food.

2397
01:25:47,157 --> 01:25:48,856
We remained quite friendly.

2398
01:25:48,857 --> 01:25:51,297
- You know... - We gave you sea squirt.

2399
01:25:51,427 --> 01:25:52,427
It really tastes amazing.

2400
01:25:52,428 --> 01:25:54,627
I told you that this dish needed sugar.

2401
01:25:54,797 --> 01:25:56,096
I told you so.

2402
01:25:56,097 --> 01:25:57,337
It really tastes amazing.

2403
01:25:57,797 --> 01:26:00,866
(Sucking)

2404
01:26:00,867 --> 01:26:02,906
- It's better with some ketchup. - I'll add a bit.

2405
01:26:02,907 --> 01:26:04,036
Lift it up.

2406
01:26:04,037 --> 01:26:05,046
You only need this much.

2407
01:26:05,047 --> 01:26:07,546
If you have a bite this way, it'll taste amazing.

2408
01:26:07,547 --> 01:26:08,547
How...

2409
01:26:08,548 --> 01:26:11,446
(You won't finish it, right?)

2410
01:26:11,447 --> 01:26:12,646
(It's our dish.)

2411
01:26:12,647 --> 01:26:14,516
- Seriously. - It's my first time seeing it.

2412
01:26:14,517 --> 01:26:15,517
I see.

2413
01:26:15,518 --> 01:26:18,016
How did they cut it like this?

2414
01:26:18,017 --> 01:26:20,256
(3 pieces of toast remain.)

2415
01:26:20,257 --> 01:26:21,997
- Don't finish the dish. - How witty.

2416
01:26:22,827 --> 01:26:24,627
- Come on. Sea squirt. - Only a few pieces remain.

2417
01:26:25,127 --> 01:26:27,166
We gave you sea squirt.

2418
01:26:27,167 --> 01:26:28,296
You know,

2419
01:26:28,297 --> 01:26:29,996
- one of you should taste it. - Sea squirt.

2420
01:26:29,997 --> 01:26:31,396
The three of you should play rock-paper-scissors.

2421
01:26:31,397 --> 01:26:32,406
Okay. Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

2422
01:26:32,407 --> 01:26:33,936
Tae Hyun, you won't eat it.

2423
01:26:33,937 --> 01:26:35,636
- Seriously. - You won't eat it.

2424
01:26:35,637 --> 01:26:36,637
Still...

2425
01:26:37,077 --> 01:26:39,176
- Hold on. - Come on.

2426
01:26:39,177 --> 01:26:40,377
- I still need to participate. - Play a hand.

2427
01:26:40,747 --> 01:26:41,776
- All right. - It's like glue.

2428
01:26:41,777 --> 01:26:42,876
You either play or lose.

2429
01:26:42,877 --> 01:26:44,917
Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors.

2430
01:26:47,247 --> 01:26:49,016
Look at this. I can't uncurl my fingers.

2431
01:26:49,017 --> 01:26:50,516
- Look at this. - Play or lose,

2432
01:26:50,517 --> 01:26:52,387
rock-paper-scissors.

2433
01:26:54,227 --> 01:26:55,227
Okay.

2434
01:26:55,228 --> 01:26:57,096
(Happy)

2435
01:26:57,097 --> 01:26:59,926
(Sad)

2436
01:26:59,927 --> 01:27:01,636
(Rock-paper-scissors determined their fate.)

2437
01:27:01,637 --> 01:27:02,766
It's so tasty.

2438
01:27:02,767 --> 01:27:04,667
You couldn't uncurl your fingers for real this time.

2439
01:27:05,167 --> 01:27:06,906
- All right. - I uncurled my fingers.

2440
01:27:06,907 --> 01:27:08,276
- Ketchup. - Add just a bit.

2441
01:27:08,277 --> 01:27:11,137
Just a bit.

2442
01:27:11,407 --> 01:27:13,576
I don't want anything else, but the toast is tasty.

2443
01:27:13,577 --> 01:27:14,647
Seriously.

2444
01:27:14,847 --> 01:27:16,216
Eat it in one bite.

2445
01:27:16,217 --> 01:27:17,717
I wanted to let one person taste it.

2446
01:27:17,917 --> 01:27:19,546
- That's right. - I think I'll crave it later.

2447
01:27:19,547 --> 01:27:21,786
(Happy)

2448
01:27:21,787 --> 01:27:24,016
I don't want anything else, but the toast is tasty.

2449
01:27:24,017 --> 01:27:25,087
Seriously.

2450
01:27:26,357 --> 01:27:28,326
I get particular about my snacks.

2451
01:27:28,327 --> 01:27:29,327
I love this toast.

2452
01:27:29,328 --> 01:27:31,496
I've eaten such snacks for over 40 years.

2453
01:27:31,497 --> 01:27:33,097
I'm the master of desserts.

2454
01:27:33,327 --> 01:27:34,627
Do you know what the detail is?

2455
01:27:34,767 --> 01:27:36,737
In other toasts, the sugar gets sprinkled inside.

2456
01:27:36,867 --> 01:27:39,666
Then the sugar melts and doesn't provide any texture.

2457
01:27:39,667 --> 01:27:41,736
But they sprinkled it outside to add the crunchy texture.

2458
01:27:41,737 --> 01:27:44,236
They sprinkled it outside so that the sweetness hits first.

2459
01:27:44,237 --> 01:27:46,606
(They sprinkled it outside so that the sweetness hits first.)

2460
01:27:46,607 --> 01:27:47,847
But I can't eat it.

2461
01:27:48,517 --> 01:27:49,576
You can't eat it.

2462
01:27:49,577 --> 01:27:50,916
- It's over. - Two people.

2463
01:27:50,917 --> 01:27:51,987
How about this?

2464
01:27:52,417 --> 01:27:53,616
Two people ate earlier.

2465
01:27:53,617 --> 01:27:54,917
- Ramyeon is here. - Ramyeon.

2466
01:27:55,687 --> 01:27:57,516
- Did we order two? - Ramyeon.

2467
01:27:57,517 --> 01:27:58,927
- We ordered one. - Hold on.

2468
01:27:59,157 --> 01:28:01,256
- Let me smell it. - Give one to the production crew.

2469
01:28:01,257 --> 01:28:03,027
- Let me smell it. - We'll take one.

2470
01:28:03,297 --> 01:28:04,396
- Why would you take it? - Smell it.

2471
01:28:04,397 --> 01:28:05,696
- We ordered 1. - They ordered 1.

2472
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:06,997
It's the smell you know, right?

2473
01:28:08,537 --> 01:28:09,997
- Gosh. - Hold on. I...

2474
01:28:10,537 --> 01:28:11,906
When I smelled it,

2475
01:28:11,907 --> 01:28:13,607
drools formed under my tongue.

2476
01:28:14,567 --> 01:28:16,606
Please give it to the crew members outside.

2477
01:28:16,607 --> 01:28:18,276
(The production crew enjoyed the remaining ramyeon.)

2478
01:28:18,277 --> 01:28:22,016
The owners have cooked ramyeon for 30 years.

2479
01:28:22,017 --> 01:28:24,416
- It's bound to be tasty. - The smell...

2480
01:28:24,417 --> 01:28:25,516
(It's like torture.)

2481
01:28:25,517 --> 01:28:26,716
Seriously.

2482
01:28:26,717 --> 01:28:27,746
- Tae Hyun. - What's wrong?

2483
01:28:27,747 --> 01:28:29,487
You said you were only going to have the toast.

2484
01:28:31,287 --> 01:28:33,526
We all know how this tastes.

2485
01:28:33,527 --> 01:28:34,986
The way he uses the chopsticks is really...

2486
01:28:34,987 --> 01:28:36,057
My gosh!

2487
01:28:37,027 --> 01:28:39,567
(Blowing)

2488
01:28:39,697 --> 01:28:41,796
- Was I like that? - You were worse than this.

2489
01:28:41,797 --> 01:28:43,437
(Getting their revenge on the seafood tease)

2490
01:28:43,697 --> 01:28:45,907
You can't be sending the smell! I can smell the ramyeon!

2491
01:28:47,637 --> 01:28:50,877
(Slurping)

2492
01:28:51,277 --> 01:28:53,677
I have ramyeon just three times a year.

2493
01:28:55,577 --> 01:28:57,676
(He even drinks the soup.)

2494
01:28:57,677 --> 01:28:58,716
(Roaring)

2495
01:28:58,717 --> 01:29:00,787
(He feels annoyed.)

2496
01:29:00,887 --> 01:29:02,917
We're going to see Dae Ho in a commercial soon.

2497
01:29:03,457 --> 01:29:04,656
Right.

2498
01:29:04,657 --> 01:29:06,726
Was ramyeon this good? What is this?

2499
01:29:06,727 --> 01:29:07,857
(I will be waiting for your calls.)

2500
01:29:07,987 --> 01:29:09,726
This tastes even better as it's something we're familiar with.

2501
01:29:09,727 --> 01:29:10,856
Which ramyeon is this?

2502
01:29:10,857 --> 01:29:12,766
We should get some from now on.

2503
01:29:12,767 --> 01:29:15,337
We started sharing our food starting with the sea squirt.

2504
01:29:15,667 --> 01:29:17,267
We got none of the ramyeon.

2505
01:29:17,837 --> 01:29:20,167
- We have a quiz left, right? - You do.

2506
01:29:20,637 --> 01:29:22,176
We have to check on which dish to use it for.

2507
01:29:22,177 --> 01:29:25,306
- It's for eating together. - It's for eating together.

2508
01:29:25,307 --> 01:29:27,546
It's the two of us that's eating.

2509
01:29:27,547 --> 01:29:30,147
We will have one person to join us to eat with us.

2510
01:29:31,017 --> 01:29:32,616
- Right. - We'll be generous.

2511
01:29:32,617 --> 01:29:35,016
- We have to go with that. - What a great guest.

2512
01:29:35,017 --> 01:29:37,087
The person that wins will be able to order another dish too.

2513
01:29:38,457 --> 01:29:40,757
- Great. - You're so wise.

2514
01:29:41,327 --> 01:29:43,556
- What a great person he is. - A great person?

2515
01:29:43,557 --> 01:29:45,426
- He's a great person. - He's a great person?

2516
01:29:45,427 --> 01:29:47,027
- He's a great person. - Give us the question.

2517
01:29:47,167 --> 01:29:48,697
- Here's the question. - Okay.

2518
01:29:49,137 --> 01:29:51,437
With the global popularity of K-Food,

2519
01:29:52,037 --> 01:29:56,037
K-Baking is gaining more and more attention as well.

2520
01:29:56,607 --> 01:29:57,707
K-Baking.

2521
01:29:58,107 --> 01:29:59,577
- K-Baking. - K-Baking.

2522
01:29:59,647 --> 01:30:00,947
The stir-fried pork is here.

2523
01:30:02,477 --> 01:30:03,616
The stir-fried pork is here.

2524
01:30:03,617 --> 01:30:05,316
(Laughing)

2525
01:30:05,317 --> 01:30:07,587
- The K-Stir-Fried Pork? - Gosh!

2526
01:30:07,747 --> 01:30:10,956
- The K-Stir-Fried Pork. - K-Baking and K-Stir-Fried Pork.

2527
01:30:10,957 --> 01:30:12,086
Right.

2528
01:30:12,087 --> 01:30:13,326
(The third dish, stir-fried pork)

2529
01:30:13,327 --> 01:30:15,697
- All right. - Gosh.

2530
01:30:15,927 --> 01:30:16,956
Gosh, look at the stir-fried pork.

2531
01:30:16,957 --> 01:30:18,896
- This is a really good part! - This part.

2532
01:30:18,897 --> 01:30:19,897
(Going wild)

2533
01:30:20,597 --> 01:30:22,866
(This is a really good part!)

2534
01:30:22,867 --> 01:30:25,636
- You only wanted the toast. - This is really thinly sliced.

2535
01:30:25,637 --> 01:30:28,006
- I'm sorry, but I know my food too. - It's thinly sliced.

2536
01:30:28,007 --> 01:30:29,637
I know the good parts too.

2537
01:30:29,777 --> 01:30:32,006
- I know the good parts. - This is the best part.

2538
01:30:32,007 --> 01:30:33,906
Put it in your mouth first.

2539
01:30:33,907 --> 01:30:36,117
(Eating)

2540
01:30:36,347 --> 01:30:37,976
You must have it with rice.

2541
01:30:37,977 --> 01:30:39,086
(Satisfied)

2542
01:30:39,087 --> 01:30:40,087
- Right. - Gosh!

2543
01:30:40,517 --> 01:30:42,457
Why is my stomach growling?

2544
01:30:42,717 --> 01:30:44,716
- I ate so much. - No way!

2545
01:30:44,717 --> 01:30:46,226
- I'm serious. - That must be the sound...

2546
01:30:46,227 --> 01:30:47,756
of you digesting the food.

2547
01:30:47,757 --> 01:30:49,857
(Forgetting about his dinner)

2548
01:30:50,127 --> 01:30:52,266
It's slightly spicy and makes you want some rice.

2549
01:30:52,267 --> 01:30:54,596
- Right. This is perfect with rice. - Right.

2550
01:30:54,597 --> 01:30:55,737
So what was the question?

2551
01:30:56,167 --> 01:30:57,837
- We should hurry. - Right.

2552
01:30:57,867 --> 01:31:00,106
I was giving you the question. All right.

2553
01:31:00,107 --> 01:31:01,566
(We have no time! Keep going with the quiz.)

2554
01:31:01,567 --> 01:31:03,076
With the global popularity of K-Food,

2555
01:31:03,077 --> 01:31:06,947
K-Baking is gaining more and more attention as well.

2556
01:31:07,907 --> 01:31:09,876
What was the first snack that was made...

2557
01:31:09,877 --> 01:31:11,776
as the start of this popularity?

2558
01:31:11,777 --> 01:31:13,546
I know the answer. The yakgwa.

2559
01:31:13,547 --> 01:31:15,216
- Incorrect. - I know the answer.

2560
01:31:15,217 --> 01:31:17,957
- We each get a chance. - Come on.

2561
01:31:18,187 --> 01:31:20,786
- We get a chance each round. - You know the rules.

2562
01:31:20,787 --> 01:31:21,957
The first snack?

2563
01:31:22,697 --> 01:31:24,127
Isn't it this one? I'll answer it.

2564
01:31:24,827 --> 01:31:25,997
The Choco Pie.

2565
01:31:26,497 --> 01:31:27,867
The Choco Pie is popular abroad.

2566
01:31:28,367 --> 01:31:30,296
- Incorrect. - That's not what it's about.

2567
01:31:30,297 --> 01:31:31,496
- Is that so? - Tae Hyun.

2568
01:31:31,497 --> 01:31:33,336
(It's the first snack made in the country.)

2569
01:31:33,337 --> 01:31:34,367
That one.

2570
01:31:35,137 --> 01:31:36,607
- The rice cracker. - Here you are.

2571
01:31:37,177 --> 01:31:38,237
Did you order another dish?

2572
01:31:38,777 --> 01:31:40,146
- What's that? - The chicken feet.

2573
01:31:40,147 --> 01:31:44,316
(Fourth dish, chicken feet)

2574
01:31:44,317 --> 01:31:45,747
He went with the rice cracker.

2575
01:31:46,187 --> 01:31:47,787
- Rice cracker is incorrect. - I know.

2576
01:31:47,847 --> 01:31:49,216
- It's the speed quiz from now on. - Right.

2577
01:31:49,217 --> 01:31:50,686
- Hangwa. - Incorrect.

2578
01:31:50,687 --> 01:31:52,457
- I know. Nurungji. - He's answering too often.

2579
01:31:52,527 --> 01:31:53,987
- Incorrect. - He's answering too often.

2580
01:31:54,657 --> 01:31:57,097
- The chicken feet are boneless. - I know. Dried persimmons.

2581
01:31:57,457 --> 01:31:59,167
- Incorrect. - I know. The hardtack.

2582
01:31:59,667 --> 01:32:00,696
Incorrect.

2583
01:32:00,697 --> 01:32:02,097
I know. The dalgona.

2584
01:32:02,637 --> 01:32:03,637
Incorrect.

2585
01:32:04,297 --> 01:32:05,367
What could it be?

2586
01:32:05,637 --> 01:32:07,707
They're sitting at a different table from us.

2587
01:32:08,207 --> 01:32:09,606
- Snack. - It's a snack.

2588
01:32:09,607 --> 01:32:10,707
- Snack? - I thought it would taste the same.

2589
01:32:11,337 --> 01:32:13,107
I thought it would taste the same.

2590
01:32:13,447 --> 01:32:15,007
- The sauce is different. - Right.

2591
01:32:16,017 --> 01:32:17,816
- The stir-fried pork is good too. - Right.

2592
01:32:17,817 --> 01:32:19,086
The chicken feet too.

2593
01:32:19,087 --> 01:32:20,116
(The stir-fried pork and chicken feet...)

2594
01:32:20,117 --> 01:32:21,117
(have different spicy flavors.)

2595
01:32:21,118 --> 01:32:22,817
- Should we get the hint? - We'll get the hint.

2596
01:32:23,187 --> 01:32:24,617
- We'll get the hint. - Would you like the hint?

2597
01:32:24,717 --> 01:32:28,127
It was first made in 1945.

2598
01:32:28,997 --> 01:32:30,157
I know. Puffed grains.

2599
01:32:30,397 --> 01:32:31,526
- What? - Incorrect.

2600
01:32:31,527 --> 01:32:33,227
- That wasn't the answer? - The streusel.

2601

The cream bun. I know. The chestnut bun.

2602

Incorrect

2603
01:32:37,638 --> 01:32:39,237
(The streusel, cream bun, and chestnut bun are all incorrect.)

2604
01:32:39,467 --> 01:32:41,976
(Swaying)

2605
01:32:41,977 --> 01:32:43,337
Hint.

2606
01:32:43,437 --> 01:32:45,776
(Closing tight)

2607
01:32:45,777 --> 01:32:47,747
Why are these two always closing their eyes?

2608
01:32:48,407 --> 01:32:50,617
- Are you two sleeping? - I'm trying to focus.

2609
01:32:51,017 --> 01:32:53,346
I'm almost there. So...

2610
01:32:53,347 --> 01:32:54,986
I know! The sweet red bean jelly!

2611
01:32:54,987 --> 01:32:56,187
Correct!

2612
01:32:57,717 --> 01:33:00,986
(Sweet red bean jelly)

2613
01:33:00,987 --> 01:33:03,526
(Second moment of disappointment)

2614
01:33:03,527 --> 01:33:05,257
Yes!

2615
01:33:05,597 --> 01:33:07,226
You two shouldn't eat anything!

2616
01:33:07,227 --> 01:33:08,766
(The eating chance goes to Tae Hyun.)

2617
01:33:08,767 --> 01:33:10,666
You did well to get that right.

2618
01:33:10,667 --> 01:33:11,767
What do you want to eat?

2619
01:33:13,407 --> 01:33:14,567
What do you want to eat?

2620
01:33:14,867 --> 01:33:16,607
- No. I won't eat at all. - What?

2621
01:33:17,837 --> 01:33:19,276
- No. I won't eat at all. - What?

2622
01:33:19,277 --> 01:33:24,176
(What did you just say?)

2623
01:33:24,177 --> 01:33:27,416
Tae Hyun!

2624
01:33:27,417 --> 01:33:29,316
(It tastes the best to annoy them.)

2625
01:33:29,317 --> 01:33:31,416
- My gosh. - I really wanted to get it right!

2626
01:33:31,417 --> 01:33:32,686
You should have a cup of coffee.

2627
01:33:32,687 --> 01:33:34,656
- I'll have some coffee. Coffee! - You should have some coffee.

2628
01:33:34,657 --> 01:33:36,397
Tae Hyun.

2629
01:33:36,457 --> 01:33:39,627
Let me ask you this.

2630
01:33:40,097 --> 01:33:41,797
It's the kimchi fried rice!

2631
01:33:42,637 --> 01:33:43,966
It's the kimchi fried rice!

2632
01:33:43,967 --> 01:33:46,367
You won't be eating.

2633
01:33:46,737 --> 01:33:47,836
Wait for a while.

2634
01:33:47,837 --> 01:33:49,037
I'll just smell it.

2635
01:33:49,607 --> 01:33:53,677
(Fifth dish, kimchi fried rice)

2636
01:33:53,777 --> 01:33:54,907
Gosh, it looks delicious.

2637
01:33:55,107 --> 01:33:56,216
Enjoy the food.

2638
01:33:56,217 --> 01:33:57,516
(Enjoying)

2639
01:33:57,517 --> 01:33:59,016
The egg soup would be perfect with that.

2640
01:33:59,017 --> 01:34:00,547
(Enjoying the food)

2641
01:34:00,987 --> 01:34:03,416
Could there be another chance?

2642
01:34:03,417 --> 01:34:05,686
He only went for coffee.

2643
01:34:05,687 --> 01:34:06,726
I'm just asking.

2644
01:34:06,727 --> 01:34:09,196
It's over now. You're being too loud.

2645
01:34:09,197 --> 01:34:11,226
Why are you being so loud when we're eating?

2646
01:34:11,227 --> 01:34:12,496
- Gosh, that looks amazing. - Why are you being so loud...

2647
01:34:12,497 --> 01:34:13,527
when we're eating?

2648
01:34:14,027 --> 01:34:15,126
Nice one!

2649
01:34:15,127 --> 01:34:16,536
(Nice one, Dae Ho!)

2650
01:34:16,537 --> 01:34:17,967
What's wrong with you, Tae Hyun?

2651
01:34:18,537 --> 01:34:19,737
Come on!

2652
01:34:19,967 --> 01:34:22,176
We let you go with stingray.

2653
01:34:22,177 --> 01:34:23,476
(Feeling great)

2654
01:34:23,477 --> 01:34:26,577
- My gosh. - I'm annoying, aren't I?

2655
01:34:26,607 --> 01:34:29,516
- I'm annoying, aren't I? - Gosh.

2656
01:34:29,517 --> 01:34:31,577
That's enough of your pranks.

2657
01:34:31,877 --> 01:34:33,147
My gosh!

2658
01:34:33,847 --> 01:34:35,416
- But... - I'm annoying, aren't I?

2659
01:34:35,417 --> 01:34:36,616
The rice can be wrapped.

2660
01:34:36,617 --> 01:34:38,216
It's all for your health.

2661
01:34:38,217 --> 01:34:39,457
But this place is just...

2662
01:34:40,027 --> 01:34:41,456
No matter how full you might be,

2663
01:34:41,457 --> 01:34:43,096
all of the dishes are familiar to you here.

2664
01:34:43,097 --> 01:34:45,667
- They're all familiar. - Who wouldn't like this?

2665
01:34:46,927 --> 01:34:49,136
- Gosh, the cabbage. - Take a shot of this.

2666
01:34:49,137 --> 01:34:50,837
I want to give you some, but I'm sorry.

2667
01:34:52,137 --> 01:34:53,806
(Putting in)

2668
01:34:53,807 --> 01:34:55,167
We're so desperate.

2669
01:34:55,207 --> 01:34:57,037
We didn't go that far!

2670
01:34:58,477 --> 01:34:59,547
It's the bibim guksu.

2671
01:34:59,977 --> 01:35:03,716
(The bibim guksu is here.)

2672
01:35:03,717 --> 01:35:05,376
- The bibim guksu. - If that's the case...

2673
01:35:05,377 --> 01:35:08,016
(Sixth dish, bibim guksu)

2674
01:35:08,017 --> 01:35:10,517
If that's the case, I won't share anything from the next episode.

2675
01:35:10,857 --> 01:35:13,927
There will be no such thing as age or seniority.

2676
01:35:14,757 --> 01:35:16,057
That's how I'll be.

2677
01:35:16,497 --> 01:35:18,026
I'm really sorry, Seung Ho.

2678
01:35:18,027 --> 01:35:19,127
I won't be here next week.

2679
01:35:20,427 --> 01:35:23,666
I'll be strict before I go. I'm sorry.

2680
01:35:23,667 --> 01:35:25,666
Please spare us once.

2681
01:35:25,667 --> 01:35:26,767
That's how I'll be.

2682
01:35:28,137 --> 01:35:29,777
I'm drooling buckets.

2683
01:35:31,077 --> 01:35:34,177
I was really full, but it's making me feel hungry.

2684
01:35:34,277 --> 01:35:35,916
Let's go for the bibim guksu.

2685
01:35:35,917 --> 01:35:37,917
This can't be missed out in street food.

2686
01:35:38,917 --> 01:35:40,017
Right.

2687
01:35:41,987 --> 01:35:44,087
- You're eating well. - That's great.

2688
01:35:47,257 --> 01:35:49,956
- But Sang Uk... - He's going after Sang Uk.

2689
01:35:49,957 --> 01:35:52,467
- He's the only one he can pick on. - I'll just ask you something.

2690
01:35:52,667 --> 01:35:54,327
Dae Ho wasn't wrong about what he said.

2691
01:35:54,667 --> 01:35:56,097
He'll be leaving us.

2692
01:35:56,867 --> 01:35:59,037
It doesn't feel like he's going to come back.

2693
01:36:00,937 --> 01:36:01,966
It's just a little.

2694
01:36:01,967 --> 01:36:03,937
I'll give you a big bite of the kimchi fried rice then.

2695
01:36:04,037 --> 01:36:05,037
Okay.

2696
01:36:05,647 --> 01:36:07,576
- Are you serious? - I'll give you a bite.

2697
01:36:07,577 --> 01:36:09,146
I was given the sea squirt.

2698
01:36:09,147 --> 01:36:10,746
Sang Uk felt bad about it.

2699
01:36:10,747 --> 01:36:12,216
It was our sea squirt.

2700
01:36:12,217 --> 01:36:13,546
(Look at this guy.)

2701
01:36:13,547 --> 01:36:16,587
Hey! That was our sea squirt.

2702
01:36:17,687 --> 01:36:18,856
It just went past me.

2703
01:36:18,857 --> 01:36:22,497
You teased Sang Uk too much earlier.

2704
01:36:23,127 --> 01:36:24,627
It was fun to tease him.

2705
01:36:24,757 --> 01:36:26,366
I was full...

2706
01:36:26,367 --> 01:36:27,867
and didn't think I would want any of the food here.

2707
01:36:28,027 --> 01:36:30,467
- Try it. It's amazing. - It's amazing.

2708
01:36:30,667 --> 01:36:32,267
- It's the egg soup! - The soup.

2709
01:36:33,067 --> 01:36:34,967
- It's the seaweed soup! - We keep getting served.

2710
01:36:35,037 --> 01:36:37,706
(He's eating it well.)

2711
01:36:37,707 --> 01:36:39,206
- Thank you. - The iced coffee.

2712
01:36:39,207 --> 01:36:40,746
(Iced coffee)

2713
01:36:40,747 --> 01:36:42,106
What? My coffee is here!

2714
01:36:42,107 --> 01:36:45,177
(Tae Hyun's coffee gets served too.)

2715
01:36:46,347 --> 01:36:48,246
You must get the answer right when you aren't greedy.

2716
01:36:48,247 --> 01:36:49,316
(He teased the younger ones and got his coffee.)

2717
01:36:49,317 --> 01:36:51,716
- It's sweet, isn't it? - That would be great.

2718
01:36:51,717 --> 01:36:53,287
(It was a sweet time of dinner.)

2719
01:36:53,457 --> 01:36:56,156
The quiz for the second meal's bill will be given.

2720
01:36:56,157 --> 01:36:57,157
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

2721
01:36:57,158 --> 01:37:00,267
He's younger than me, so I should be the one to pay.

2722
01:37:00,527 --> 01:37:01,927
Not at all.

2723
01:37:02,027 --> 01:37:03,296
- Will you pay for him? - Right.

2724
01:37:03,297 --> 01:37:06,236
No, Dae Ho. You can get it right and make one of us pay.

2725
01:37:06,237 --> 01:37:07,836
Right. I should get it right then.

2726
01:37:07,837 --> 01:37:08,937
Right.

2727
01:37:09,137 --> 01:37:10,507
French toast...

2728
01:37:11,377 --> 01:37:13,177
is a French dish...

2729
01:37:13,707 --> 01:37:16,877
made with bread soaked in beaten-up eggs.

2730
01:37:18,017 --> 01:37:20,847
French toast in French...

2731
01:37:21,387 --> 01:37:23,657
means "blank bread..."

2732
01:37:24,017 --> 01:37:26,727
and is called "Pain Perdu."

2733
01:37:27,457 --> 01:37:28,857
What is the word that replaces "blank?"

2734
01:37:29,357 --> 01:37:31,357
Pain Perdu is French toast?

2735
01:37:32,397 --> 01:37:35,697
Is that the exact pronunciation?

2736
01:37:35,937 --> 01:37:37,566
- My gosh. - Is that right?

2737
01:37:37,567 --> 01:37:39,006
- You're going that far? - Come on.

2738
01:37:39,007 --> 01:37:41,206
- Gosh. - Fencing is a French sport.

2739
01:37:41,207 --> 01:37:42,876
(Fencing is a French sport.)

2740
01:37:42,877 --> 01:37:48,007
(The correct pronunciation for Pain Perdu)

2741
01:37:48,207 --> 01:37:50,277
What could it be?

2742
01:37:50,777 --> 01:37:51,877
The dinner roll?

2743
01:37:53,147 --> 01:37:55,186
The French toast must've been...

2744
01:37:55,187 --> 01:37:57,187
- a quick breakfast meal. - Right.

2745
01:37:57,587 --> 01:37:59,627
The "Pain" could mean "fast."

2746
01:38:00,157 --> 01:38:01,926
- That might be what it means. - I see.

2747
01:38:01,927 --> 01:38:04,297
- It means to eat quickly. - What could it mean?

2748
01:38:04,357 --> 01:38:06,896
The first word means "bread."

2749
01:38:06,897 --> 01:38:08,937
"Pain."

2750
01:38:09,037 --> 01:38:11,366
We have to find out what "Perdu" means.

2751
01:38:11,367 --> 01:38:12,806
(A question about getting "Perdu" right)

2752
01:38:12,807 --> 01:38:15,836
(The seafood team looks up the answer.)

2753
01:38:15,837 --> 01:38:18,607
Gosh, I found it.

2754
01:38:19,107 --> 01:38:22,376
(It's this, right?)

2755
01:38:22,377 --> 01:38:24,077
(I see.)

2756
01:38:24,117 --> 01:38:25,317
But...

2757
01:38:25,717 --> 01:38:27,547
to be honest, it's really hard.

2758
01:38:27,647 --> 01:38:29,216
- Is it very difficult? - Even if you had time...

2759
01:38:29,217 --> 01:38:30,686
This seems impossible to guess.

2760
01:38:30,687 --> 01:38:31,856
I have no idea.

2761
01:38:31,857 --> 01:38:33,087
I'll give you a hint.

2762
01:38:33,587 --> 01:38:36,497
Imagine someone who's never seen this bread before.

2763
01:38:36,527 --> 01:38:37,827
It's like when...

2764
01:38:37,857 --> 01:38:39,067
he sees it for the first time.

2765
01:38:39,297 --> 01:38:40,326
Do you get it?

2766
01:38:40,327 --> 01:38:41,596
- In my opinion... - That feeling...

2767
01:38:41,597 --> 01:38:42,937
Dong Hyun is a genius.

2768
01:38:42,967 --> 01:38:45,396
- He made it impossible to guess. - No...

2769
01:38:45,397 --> 01:38:47,006
You just repeated...

2770
01:38:47,007 --> 01:38:48,407
the question.

2771
01:38:48,607 --> 01:38:50,976
Do you know what French toast looks like?

2772
01:38:50,977 --> 01:38:52,036
Yes, this is it.

2773
01:38:52,037 --> 01:38:53,846
- Someone saw it... - This is a French toast.

2774
01:38:53,847 --> 01:38:55,246
For the first time after seeing only toast bread.

2775
01:38:55,247 --> 01:38:56,817
- This is a French toast. - That's the answer.

2776
01:38:57,217 --> 01:38:58,477
It looks like this.

2777
01:38:58,617 --> 01:38:59,816
It's either...

2778
01:38:59,817 --> 01:39:01,317
burnt or grilled bread.

2779
01:39:01,547 --> 01:39:03,487
- Is this it? - If we were to be simple.

2780
01:39:04,257 --> 01:39:06,386
- It's burnt bread or grilled bread. - Grilled bread?

2781
01:39:06,387 --> 01:39:07,787
(Grilled bread?)

2782
01:39:08,157 --> 01:39:09,357
Grilled cheese bread.

2783
01:39:09,957 --> 01:39:12,027
- Grilled cheese bread? - Yes.

2784
01:39:12,327 --> 01:39:13,667
Grilled cheese bread.

2785
01:39:14,467 --> 01:39:15,627
Cheese bread.

2786
01:39:16,097 --> 01:39:17,166
Cheese bread?

2787
01:39:17,167 --> 01:39:20,507
(Answer: Cheese bread)

2788
01:39:22,577 --> 01:39:24,006
(Answer: Cheese bread)

2789
01:39:24,007 --> 01:39:25,137
Incorrect.

2790
01:39:25,337 --> 01:39:26,946
- I knew it was wrong. - It's so hard.

2791
01:39:26,947 --> 01:39:29,417
(Dae Ho and Sang Uk fail.)

2792
01:39:29,617 --> 01:39:30,817
It's very difficult.

2793
01:39:31,577 --> 01:39:34,717
(They must pick one person to pay for the street food.)

2794
01:39:34,747 --> 01:39:36,716
We'll give you more hints, so keep guessing.

2795
01:39:36,717 --> 01:39:38,417
Okay, I like the speed quiz idea.

2796
01:39:38,457 --> 01:39:39,726
Do it like a speed quiz.

2797
01:39:39,727 --> 01:39:41,526
(Proceeding as a speed quiz with the same question)

2798
01:39:41,527 --> 01:39:43,796
Can you just confirm this?

2799
01:39:43,797 --> 01:39:45,357
- We weren't even close, were we? - A moment ago...

2800
01:39:45,397 --> 01:39:46,496
You got close.

2801
01:39:46,497 --> 01:39:48,727
- Dae Ho's approach was... - Burnt bread.

2802
01:39:49,167 --> 01:39:50,736
I got it. Burnt bread.

2803
01:39:50,737 --> 01:39:52,406
(Answer: Burnt bread)

2804
01:39:52,407 --> 01:39:53,567
That's incorrect.

2805
01:39:54,307 --> 01:39:56,137
I got it. Inedible bread?

2806
01:39:56,807 --> 01:39:57,837
Incorrect.

2807
01:39:59,047 --> 01:40:01,507
Actually, that's much closer to the answer.

2808
01:40:01,977 --> 01:40:03,516
It sounds like it.

2809
01:40:03,517 --> 01:40:04,547
(Inedible bread is close to the answer?)

2810
01:40:04,717 --> 01:40:06,246
I got it. Bread to be thrown away.

2811
01:40:06,247 --> 01:40:07,616
(Answer: Bread to be thrown away)

2812
01:40:07,617 --> 01:40:09,917
- Correct. - What's the answer?

2813
01:40:09,987 --> 01:40:12,186
It means "bread that's thrown away."

2814
01:40:12,187 --> 01:40:14,356
It refers to old bread that became hard.

2815
01:40:14,357 --> 01:40:17,226
It's thrown away because it's inedible.

2816
01:40:17,227 --> 01:40:20,166
When such bread was coated with eggs and grilled,

2817
01:40:20,167 --> 01:40:21,796
it became moist once again.

2818
01:40:21,797 --> 01:40:23,266
(The name comes from the fact...)

2819
01:40:23,267 --> 01:40:24,867
(that it'd have been thrown away without milk and eggs.)

2820
01:40:25,067 --> 01:40:27,736
- Dae Ho will pay. - That's good.

2821
01:40:27,737 --> 01:40:30,276
He'll pay for Sang Uk who's younger than him.

2822
01:40:30,277 --> 01:40:31,576
(Dae Ho will pay for the street food.)

2823
01:40:31,577 --> 01:40:34,546
Our dinner menu in Eulji-ro.

2824
01:40:34,547 --> 01:40:35,707
(Handsome Guys' Eulji-ro, Today's Dinner Menu Recommendation)

2825
01:40:35,747 --> 01:40:39,046
It's open 24 hours, which is unbelievable.

2826
01:40:39,047 --> 01:40:40,887
Do we have to eat dinner here?

2827
01:40:41,347 --> 01:40:42,687
Someone like me...

2828
01:40:42,787 --> 01:40:44,557
- would eat here at night. - At night?

2829
01:40:44,787 --> 01:40:47,656
- I disagree. I'd eat dinner here. - Me too.

2830
01:40:47,657 --> 01:40:48,987
I'd go over there for drinks.

2831
01:40:49,327 --> 01:40:50,596
They didn't have rice there.

2832
01:40:50,597 --> 01:40:51,757
Is that so?

2833
01:40:51,957 --> 01:40:53,897
I'd definitely eat dinner here.

2834
01:40:53,967 --> 01:40:55,227
You have...

2835
01:40:55,327 --> 01:40:57,796
many choices, and the food is delicious.

2836
01:40:57,797 --> 01:41:00,107
- Cost-effectiveness is crucial too. - Right.

2837
01:41:00,337 --> 01:41:02,736
This place satisfies both of them.

2838
01:41:02,737 --> 01:41:04,206
It's hard to say which place is better.

2839
01:41:04,207 --> 01:41:05,806
(Tae Hyun: Seafood, perfect for a drink after work)

2840
01:41:05,807 --> 01:41:07,046
(Dae Ho: Street food, eat a meal here and get seafood after)

2841
01:41:07,047 --> 01:41:08,977
- Good work. - Good work.

2842
01:41:09,717 --> 01:41:10,876
Ma'am, I'd like to pay.

2843
01:41:10,877 --> 01:41:11,976
(Dae Ho goes to pay for the street food.)

2844
01:41:11,977 --> 01:41:13,816
Why are you the one paying?

2845
01:41:13,817 --> 01:41:15,416
I'm supposed to pay.

2846
01:41:15,417 --> 01:41:17,287
I failed to answer the question.

2847
01:41:17,517 --> 01:41:20,327
I'm happy to pay because I enjoyed it very much.

2848
01:41:20,887 --> 01:41:22,326
Thank you.

2849
01:41:22,327 --> 01:41:23,927
(Total: 84 dollars)

2850
01:41:23,997 --> 01:41:25,296
I really enjoyed it.

2851
01:41:25,297 --> 01:41:28,397
(He paid.)

2852
01:41:29,267 --> 01:41:30,367
All right.

2853
01:41:31,905 --> 01:41:35,505
(A day in the spring with fluttering cherry blossoms)

2854
01:41:36,615 --> 01:41:38,445
Who's coming today instead of Sang Uk?

2855
01:41:38,815 --> 01:41:40,815
(Arriving with the gentle spring breeze)

2856
01:41:40,945 --> 01:41:43,114
(Returning to Handsome Guys)

2857
01:41:43,115 --> 01:41:44,815
(The guest we're reminded of in the spring)

2858
01:41:46,985 --> 01:41:49,795
(Revisiting after the Year of the Snake episode)

2859
01:41:49,855 --> 01:41:51,024
Hello, nice to meet you.

2860
01:41:51,025 --> 01:41:53,364
(Rhymer, the godfather of hip-hop)

2861
01:41:53,365 --> 01:41:55,224
You appeared so briefly last time,

2862
01:41:55,225 --> 01:41:56,564
so it was a bummer.

2863
01:41:56,565 --> 01:41:58,095
To me, it felt really long.

2864
01:41:59,965 --> 01:42:02,605
(With the screen time maker who's better than Kim Woo Bin)

2865
01:42:02,875 --> 01:42:06,104
(Where is today's neighborhood for menu recommendation?)

2866
01:42:06,105 --> 01:42:07,344
(Yeonhui)

2867
01:42:07,345 --> 01:42:08,805
(Yeonnam)

2868
01:42:09,475 --> 01:42:11,244
(Overflowing with tasty restaurants and hot spots)

2869
01:42:11,245 --> 01:42:13,215
(A neighborhood with trendy charms)

2870
01:42:14,515 --> 01:42:16,355
(What is Handsome Menu Pick?)

2871
01:42:20,555 --> 01:42:21,655
(Stretching)

2872
01:42:26,925 --> 01:42:28,324
(Bad food is...)

2873
01:42:28,325 --> 01:42:30,535
(not our type.)

2874
01:42:30,595 --> 01:42:32,835
(Who'll Pay Quiz can't be left out.)

2875
01:42:32,905 --> 01:42:35,134
(Full of confidence)

2876
01:42:35,135 --> 01:42:36,174
Eight times seven equals?

2877
01:42:36,175 --> 01:42:37,175
Fifty-seven.

2878
01:42:38,535 --> 01:42:40,075
- Ho Chi Minh. - Hanoi.

2879
01:42:40,205 --> 01:42:43,344
(He was so confident that we thought he was right.)

2880
01:42:43,345 --> 01:42:45,544
(Being reckless)

2881
