1
00:00:15,198 --> 00:00:16,867
(Is it rice...)

2
00:00:16,868 --> 00:00:18,238
(or noodles?)

3
00:00:18,398 --> 00:00:19,897
(Bread...)

4
00:00:19,898 --> 00:00:22,207
(or rice cakes?)

5
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:23,807
(After making the choice...)

6
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,477
(Exultation...)

7
00:00:25,478 --> 00:00:27,478
(and regret)

8
00:00:27,678 --> 00:00:30,148
(Anguish and resolution)

9
00:00:30,748 --> 00:00:33,978
(The time of abundance)

10
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:36,188
(For modern people who suffer from such a dilemma)

11
00:00:36,688 --> 00:00:41,828
(The menu conflict agents, Handsome Guys)

12
00:00:43,628 --> 00:00:45,058
(It starts again today.)

13
00:00:45,198 --> 00:00:46,627
(Seoul K-Medi Center)

14
00:00:46,628 --> 00:00:48,398
This place is really nice.

15
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:50,568
I like this.

16
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:52,237
It's my first time here.

17
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:54,014
- It's my first time too. - What is this place?

18
00:00:54,038 --> 00:00:55,107
(More Handsome Guys arrive.)

19
00:00:55,108 --> 00:00:56,108
- The weather is beautiful. - It's nice.

20
00:00:56,109 --> 00:00:57,907
Have you also lived here?

21
00:00:57,908 --> 00:00:59,238
Everyone is asking me that.

22
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:02,277
(Jamsil)

23
00:01:02,278 --> 00:01:06,647
(Namyeong-dong)

24
00:01:06,648 --> 00:01:10,548
(Seongsu)

25
00:01:10,818 --> 00:01:14,128
(Yi Kyung has lived in all the neighborhoods.)

26
00:01:14,628 --> 00:01:16,587
(Has he lived here too?)

27
00:01:16,588 --> 00:01:17,597
I haven't lived here.

28
00:01:17,598 --> 00:01:18,827
- You haven't? - No.

29
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,457
- That's a relief. - Whenever someone sees me...

30
00:01:20,458 --> 00:01:22,028
- That's a relief. - Congratulations.

31
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:24,438
Everyone is asking me if I've lived here.

32
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:26,297
This is my first time at Gyeongdong Market.

33
00:01:26,298 --> 00:01:27,618
- This is your first time? - Yes.

34
00:01:27,938 --> 00:01:30,437
Isn't this where people sell medicinal herbs?

35
00:01:30,438 --> 00:01:31,877
- That's correct. - I can smell them.

36
00:01:31,878 --> 00:01:33,037
- This place is also called... - I've been here.

37
00:01:33,038 --> 00:01:34,307
Yangnyeong Market.

38
00:01:34,308 --> 00:01:35,407
- "Yangnyeong?" - Yes, it's full...

39
00:01:35,408 --> 00:01:37,147
- of herbal medicine shops. - Right.

40
00:01:37,148 --> 00:01:38,908
- You're right. - They sell medicinal herbs.

41
00:01:39,278 --> 00:01:41,488
That's why there's a distinct smell...

42
00:01:41,548 --> 00:01:44,017
- of Korean medicine here. - Right.

43
00:01:44,018 --> 00:01:45,217
(A place where you can find hundreds of medicinal herbs)

44
00:01:45,218 --> 00:01:46,617
- It feels healthy. - Right.

45
00:01:46,618 --> 00:01:50,288
Don't you need medicine from a place like this, Dong Hyun?

46
00:01:50,758 --> 00:01:52,227
Don't you need Korean medicine?

47
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:53,874
- Korean medicine? - You seem like the type...

48
00:01:53,898 --> 00:01:56,467
- Korean medicine? - who would eat a lot of snakes.

49
00:01:56,468 --> 00:01:59,037
- I ate frogs instead of snakes. - Aren't frogs used for medicine?

50
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:00,698
What are the benefits of eating frogs?

51
00:02:00,798 --> 00:02:02,614
- Frogs... - Don't they make you look like him?

52
00:02:02,638 --> 00:02:03,638
Do you turn into a frog?
(Frog)

53
00:02:04,708 --> 00:02:05,777
No.

54
00:02:05,778 --> 00:02:06,937
Frogs are good...

55
00:02:06,938 --> 00:02:08,778
- for athletes. - I can see that.

56
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:10,447
Eating frogs can increase your stamina.

57
00:02:10,448 --> 00:02:11,448
Right.

58
00:02:11,449 --> 00:02:14,617
Didn't your parents give you bitter Korean medicine when you were young?

59
00:02:14,618 --> 00:02:16,247
No, I don't think so.

60
00:02:16,248 --> 00:02:18,387
They gave me gomtang as invigorating food.

61
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,417
- Right. - "Gomtang?"

62
00:02:19,418 --> 00:02:21,034
- It was called "bone soup" then. - Bone soup.

63
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,087
Things like that.

64
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:24,057
We won't be the only ones on the show.

65
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:25,304
- A guest will be joining us. - Okay.

66
00:02:25,328 --> 00:02:26,428
He's a returning guest.

67
00:02:26,828 --> 00:02:28,728
- He's a total brainiac. - Goodness.

68
00:02:28,828 --> 00:02:30,227
Here's our Park John, John Park.

69
00:02:30,228 --> 00:02:31,797
(Today's guest on Handsome Guys, John Park)

70
00:02:31,798 --> 00:02:34,568
- Hello. - Hello.

71
00:02:37,368 --> 00:02:40,178
(He visited Handsome Guys last winter.)

72
00:02:40,608 --> 00:02:44,948
(With a different reasoning approach)

73
00:02:45,218 --> 00:02:46,218
That's correct.

74
00:02:46,219 --> 00:02:50,248
(The kingmaker swept away all the quizzes.)

75
00:02:51,518 --> 00:02:52,717
(Even his brain is sexy.)

76
00:02:52,718 --> 00:02:54,088
(John Park)

77
00:02:54,788 --> 00:02:55,788
(Exclaiming)
(However...)

78
00:02:56,789 --> 00:02:58,098
(Who taught him that?)

79
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:02,398
(His smartness disappears in front of naengmyeon?)

80
00:03:03,128 --> 00:03:04,997
(John Park who loves naengmyeon)

81
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:06,837
(Spoiler alert: Naengmyeon is one of our recommendations today.)

82
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:09,067
- I didn't get to see him that day. - That's true.

83
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:10,267
You're right.

84
00:03:10,268 --> 00:03:12,237
- Hyuk replaced Tae Hyun. - Tae Hyun was busy that day.

85
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:14,647
Our show has changed since then.

86
00:03:14,648 --> 00:03:15,777
Have you watched the show recently?

87
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,718
Aren't you having an easy time these days?

88
00:03:18,578 --> 00:03:20,348
- Exactly. - Yes.

89
00:03:20,518 --> 00:03:22,387
It's easy for some of us.

90
00:03:22,388 --> 00:03:24,017
- In the past, it took at least... - Right.

91
00:03:24,018 --> 00:03:26,088
Four hours to get to work.

92
00:03:26,188 --> 00:03:27,627
Commuting to work was very difficult.

93
00:03:27,628 --> 00:03:28,628
- Right. - It's convenient now.

94
00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:31,557
I came here today to have an easy time.

95
00:03:31,558 --> 00:03:33,327
I'm Singer John Park. Nice to see you.

96
00:03:33,328 --> 00:03:34,997
(Welcome back to Handsome Guys.)

97
00:03:34,998 --> 00:03:36,368
He came here to have an easy time.

98
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:38,297
Have you seen us submitting our credit cards?

99
00:03:38,298 --> 00:03:39,397
I know about that. I brought mine.

100
00:03:39,398 --> 00:03:40,538
- You brought it? - Yes.

101
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:42,107
John,

102
00:03:42,108 --> 00:03:45,038
you aren't expecting them to give it back to you, right?

103
00:03:45,178 --> 00:03:47,578
I know Ho Jin very well.

104
00:03:48,048 --> 00:03:50,377
He's famous for being ruthless.

105
00:03:50,378 --> 00:03:51,478
You know him very well.

106
00:03:51,718 --> 00:03:54,487
I'll do my best on the quizzes today.

107
00:03:54,488 --> 00:03:56,648
- He's a brainiac. - He's really smart.

108
00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:58,187
That's not true.

109
00:03:58,188 --> 00:03:59,188
(Being modest)

110
00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:00,257
John Park,

111
00:04:00,258 --> 00:04:02,728
who do you think paid the most?

112
00:04:03,188 --> 00:04:04,528
The most?

113
00:04:04,628 --> 00:04:05,857
In other words, someone failed...

114
00:04:05,858 --> 00:04:07,528
- to answer correctly. - Exactly.

115
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,537
- He looks like someone... - I'm one of the top these days.

116
00:04:11,538 --> 00:04:13,367
Have you gotten better these days?

117
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:14,507
- I'm one of the top. - He's not,

118
00:04:14,508 --> 00:04:16,537
but two people have been doing terribly.

119
00:04:16,538 --> 00:04:17,538
- Is that so? - He automatically ranked...
in the middle.

120
00:04:18,539 --> 00:04:20,037
Who could they be?

121
00:04:20,038 --> 00:04:21,707
When you got invited to the show again,

122
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:24,078
didn't your wife say something?

123
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:26,618
When I said that I'd be at Gyeongdong Market today,

124
00:04:26,878 --> 00:04:29,787
she said, "Gyeongdong Market is popular these days."

125
00:04:29,788 --> 00:04:31,157
- Really? - I found out about it today.

126
00:04:31,158 --> 00:04:32,288
I've never heard of it.

127
00:04:32,658 --> 00:04:33,717
- She said that it was popular. - Is it?

128
00:04:33,718 --> 00:04:35,087
It has many new tasty restaurants.

129
00:04:35,088 --> 00:04:37,758
A lot of young people come here.

130
00:04:38,358 --> 00:04:40,857
(The location for today's recommendations)

131
00:04:40,858 --> 00:04:43,627
(Gyeongdong Market)

132
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:46,438
We might think of Gyeongdong Market as a small market,

133
00:04:47,268 --> 00:04:49,167
but its size is actually huge.

134
00:04:49,168 --> 00:04:50,808
(The biggest traditional market in Seoul)

135
00:04:51,278 --> 00:04:53,908
They sell fresh produce...

136
00:04:54,308 --> 00:04:55,548
and fish.

137
00:04:56,308 --> 00:04:57,717
(Fresh meat)

138
00:04:57,718 --> 00:04:59,418
They also sell herbal medicine.

139
00:04:59,718 --> 00:05:01,417
The market has everything.

140
00:05:01,418 --> 00:05:03,194
(A traditional market where you can find anything)

141
00:05:03,218 --> 00:05:06,188
As he said, it's a popular spot among zoomers.

142
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,387
- It's very cost-effective. - I can see that.

143
00:05:08,388 --> 00:05:09,428
Exactly.

144
00:05:09,528 --> 00:05:10,857
This is Gyeongdong Market.

145
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:13,128
(What will be Handsome Guys's food recommendation?)

146
00:05:13,798 --> 00:05:16,528
Today at Gyeongdong Market, we'll be having...

147
00:05:16,628 --> 00:05:18,798
naengmyeon and Korean set menu.

148
00:05:18,868 --> 00:05:19,868
Naengmyeon?

149
00:05:19,869 --> 00:05:22,607
Is there a good naengmyeon restaurant at the market?

150
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:23,608
I didn't know.

151
00:05:24,038 --> 00:05:25,637
He practically knows all naengmyeon restaurants in the country.

152
00:05:25,638 --> 00:05:27,038
He's a naengmyeon expert.

153
00:05:27,178 --> 00:05:29,207
- Naengmyeon expert? - Yes, that's me.

154
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:32,178
You don't know any tasty naengmyeon restaurant here?

155
00:05:32,578 --> 00:05:35,147
I've never come here before.

156
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:36,287
That means...

157
00:05:36,288 --> 00:05:38,617
Then it would be John's first time as well.

158
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:40,634
(To refresh your taste buds that are tired from the sweltering heat)

159
00:05:40,658 --> 00:05:43,857
(The first menu, naengmyeon)

160
00:05:43,858 --> 00:05:46,028
The Korean set menu includes...

161
00:05:46,798 --> 00:05:48,278
- about 12 to 13 side dishes. - What?

162
00:05:49,228 --> 00:05:50,967
It sounds more like a Korean course meal.

163
00:05:50,968 --> 00:05:53,198
- Inside the market? - I heard that...

164
00:05:53,768 --> 00:05:55,308
the rice was served in a pot.

165
00:05:55,408 --> 00:05:57,068
- What? - Is it served in a stone pot?

166
00:05:57,308 --> 00:05:58,607
- That sounds delicious. - With sungnyung?

167
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,208
- It has nurungji. - And sungnyung.

168
00:06:01,578 --> 00:06:04,108
(It's very rice!)

169
00:06:04,178 --> 00:06:06,317
- I'm not that interested... - The pot rice sounds good.

170
00:06:06,318 --> 00:06:08,418
- in rice served in a pot. - Really?

171
00:06:08,988 --> 00:06:10,988
You can't eat the pot anyway.

172
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:14,488
What's important is the content inside the pot.

173
00:06:14,788 --> 00:06:16,488
I have many pots at home.

174
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:20,558
I made my choice already.

175
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:21,997
- Naengmyeon? - Yes.

176
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:23,868
I'll go after naengmyeon and a side dish.

177
00:06:24,798 --> 00:06:25,837
- It's really good. - I wasn't thinking about it,

178
00:06:25,838 --> 00:06:28,108
but I'll get a proper bowl of naengmyeon with Seung Ho.

179
00:06:28,908 --> 00:06:29,967
I want naengmyeon too.

180
00:06:29,968 --> 00:06:31,177
(Suddenly?)

181
00:06:31,178 --> 00:06:32,458
- All of a sudden? - Naengmyeon.

182
00:06:32,538 --> 00:06:33,707
- Really? - I'll pick naengmyeon.

183
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,607
- Didn't you have it yesterday? - I did,

184
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:37,507
but I can eat naengmyeon every day.

185
00:06:37,508 --> 00:06:39,447
- Since you know... - I don't get tired of it.

186
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:40,647
A lot about naengmyeon,

187
00:06:40,648 --> 00:06:42,247
- please make a comparison. - Sure.

188
00:06:42,248 --> 00:06:44,417
- That's a good idea. - As a connoisseur of naengmyeon,

189
00:06:44,418 --> 00:06:45,617
- Exactly. - I'll make a proper comparison.

190
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:47,357
We have three for naengmyeon.

191
00:06:47,358 --> 00:06:49,657
As I already told you...

192
00:06:49,658 --> 00:06:50,687
- You prefer rice, don't you? - You don't like naengmyeon.

193
00:06:50,688 --> 00:06:53,328
I don't like cold food like naengmyeon.

194
00:06:53,398 --> 00:06:55,527
Just don't make me eat alone.

195
00:06:55,528 --> 00:06:56,827
Then I'll eat rice with you.

196
00:06:56,828 --> 00:06:57,998
Is your choice rice?

197
00:06:58,038 --> 00:06:59,298
I'll get rice too.

198
00:06:59,568 --> 00:07:01,207
- Why? - The members are amazing.

199
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,208
(A higher chance of not paying)

200
00:07:02,209 --> 00:07:03,768
These members are great.

201
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:05,407
- Hey. - To be honest,

202
00:07:05,408 --> 00:07:06,608
I can't decide.

203
00:07:07,078 --> 00:07:08,407
I like both dishes,

204
00:07:08,408 --> 00:07:10,008
but the members are too good to pass up.

205
00:07:10,078 --> 00:07:12,147
- Goodness. - Tae Hyun is no longer the ace.

206
00:07:12,148 --> 00:07:14,647
- It's okay. - My goodness.

207
00:07:14,648 --> 00:07:16,888
Why don't we make Sang Uk pay?

208
00:07:17,018 --> 00:07:19,018
Let's work together to make Sang Uk pay.

209
00:07:19,218 --> 00:07:20,357
I can't wait...

210
00:07:20,358 --> 00:07:22,058
to find out what happens today.

211
00:07:22,188 --> 00:07:24,057
- Tae Hyun and I'll switch places. - Okay.

212
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:26,027
People on this side are...

213
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,498
Team Naengmyeon.

214
00:07:27,598 --> 00:07:29,027
This is Team Korean set menu.

215
00:07:29,028 --> 00:07:30,727
Don't you think that we'll get Korean set menu first?

216
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:32,667
- I hope it'll be naengmyeon first. - Really?

217
00:07:32,668 --> 00:07:33,897
- Yes. - Dong Hyun has eaten...

218
00:07:33,898 --> 00:07:35,367
- before the shoot. - Right.

219
00:07:35,368 --> 00:07:37,038
You're such an individualist.

220
00:07:37,568 --> 00:07:38,737
- Tae Hyun. - He's...

221
00:07:38,738 --> 00:07:40,277
I'd give you food if you come to my house.

222
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:41,407
He's an individualist.

223
00:07:41,408 --> 00:07:42,607
I ate alone because I was home alone.

224
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:43,947
How could you have breakfast today?

225
00:07:43,948 --> 00:07:45,677
How could you call me an individualist?

226
00:07:45,678 --> 00:07:48,047
We promised not to eat breakfast before the show.

227
00:07:48,048 --> 00:07:49,087
Right before the shoot next week,

228
00:07:49,088 --> 00:07:50,717
let's get together at Dong Hyun's house in the morning.

229
00:07:50,718 --> 00:07:51,718
- Get together. - Let's get together.

230
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:53,157
- I'll give you food. - We're really coming.

231
00:07:53,158 --> 00:07:54,417
- Yi Kyung and I'll definitely come. - Please do.

232
00:07:54,418 --> 00:07:55,627
We'll be coming.

233
00:07:55,628 --> 00:07:56,687
Let's do the opening segment next week...

234
00:07:56,688 --> 00:07:57,727
- at your house. - That sounds good.

235
00:07:57,728 --> 00:07:59,157
- That sounds good. - That sounds great.

236
00:07:59,158 --> 00:08:00,657
- Seriously. - That sounds great.

237
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:02,298
- All of you should come. - Come.

238
00:08:02,998 --> 00:08:04,127
All of them?

239
00:08:04,128 --> 00:08:06,048
- That'd be too many people. - At Dong Hyun's...

240
00:08:06,238 --> 00:08:08,238
- You're backing away. - That'd be too many.

241
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:09,568
That's impossible.

242
00:08:09,638 --> 00:08:10,638
Please don't.

243
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,207
The essence of the market.

244
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,408
- We'll get Korean set menu first. - Okay.

245
00:08:14,608 --> 00:08:16,407
My goodness.

246
00:08:16,408 --> 00:08:18,117
(As expected, Dong Hyun's wish is ignored.)

247
00:08:18,118 --> 00:08:19,817
Dong Hyun, it's better to eat first.

248
00:08:19,818 --> 00:08:21,718
- My goodness. - Korean set menu.

249
00:08:21,788 --> 00:08:23,318
Let's go and eat.

250
00:08:23,418 --> 00:08:24,617
With John Park.

251
00:08:24,618 --> 00:08:27,018
That's so strange.

252
00:08:27,488 --> 00:08:28,557
(Cheongnyang Traditional Market)

253
00:08:28,558 --> 00:08:30,888
(At lunchtime, )

254
00:08:31,128 --> 00:08:34,797
(The workers' hands get busier, )

255
00:08:34,798 --> 00:08:41,068
(and the market gets more crowded.)

256
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:44,068
I often came to a market like this when I was a kid.

257
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:45,738
Look at the watermelons.

258
00:08:46,078 --> 00:08:47,208
Summer is here now.

259
00:08:47,438 --> 00:08:49,607
There's a coffee shop inside the market. My goodness.

260
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:51,778
- There it is. - What?

261
00:08:52,318 --> 00:08:54,547
That's so fascinating.

262
00:08:54,548 --> 00:08:56,047
(Not only a big franchise cafe)

263
00:08:56,048 --> 00:08:59,358
- Isn't that created by LG? - What?

264
00:08:59,688 --> 00:09:02,057
- Up there. - You're right.

265
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:03,128
My gosh.

266
00:09:03,228 --> 00:09:04,757
There's something amazing about it.

267
00:09:04,758 --> 00:09:06,434
(A place where tradition and modernity coexist)

268
00:09:06,458 --> 00:09:08,618
You don't usually come to traditional markets, do you?

269
00:09:08,698 --> 00:09:10,068
Sometimes, I come here...

270
00:09:10,368 --> 00:09:11,798
with friends from abroad.

271
00:09:11,998 --> 00:09:14,568
- To feel the Korean vibe? - Yes.

272
00:09:15,668 --> 00:09:16,868
Please come this way.

273
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:20,577
There's a shopping center in the back.

274
00:09:20,578 --> 00:09:23,047
(A shopping center in the underground appears.)

275
00:09:23,048 --> 00:09:24,454
(The entrance to the underground shopping center)

276
00:09:24,478 --> 00:09:28,587
(It unfolds when you go downstairs.)

277
00:09:28,588 --> 00:09:29,718
Is this what it looks like?

278
00:09:31,658 --> 00:09:33,217
This is what it looks like underground.

279
00:09:33,218 --> 00:09:34,557
There's more underground?

280
00:09:34,558 --> 00:09:36,157
- It's a fish market. - Hello.

281
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:37,227
Hello.

282
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:38,558
This is amazing.

283
00:09:39,028 --> 00:09:40,897
The skate has a face that's similar...

284
00:09:40,898 --> 00:09:42,298
to a human face.

285
00:09:43,528 --> 00:09:44,598
Tae Hyun.

286
00:09:45,138 --> 00:09:46,998
Is it right here?

287
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:49,167
(Gosh, what's this?)

288
00:09:49,168 --> 00:09:51,407
There's a Korean set menu restaurant.

289
00:09:51,408 --> 00:09:52,738
It's quite crowded.

290
00:09:53,008 --> 00:09:54,808
This is...

291
00:09:55,178 --> 00:09:56,248
It's awesome.

292
00:09:56,948 --> 00:09:59,978
(Deep in the basement at Gyeongdong Market)

293
00:10:00,718 --> 00:10:04,218
(There's one restaurant inside.)

294
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:08,628
(A place where people never stop coming day after day)

295
00:10:09,028 --> 00:10:12,198
I saw that Tzuyang came to this restaurant.

296
00:10:12,428 --> 00:10:15,228
(Not only celebrities come)

297
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:16,797
Where are you from?

298
00:10:16,798 --> 00:10:17,968
I'm from the US.

299
00:10:18,238 --> 00:10:21,707
I stop by here when I come back to Korea.

300
00:10:21,708 --> 00:10:22,838
The food is delicious.

301
00:10:23,508 --> 00:10:27,008
(Each dish is served with care.)

302
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:32,118
(Treated with care)

303
00:10:32,178 --> 00:10:33,547
They serve 12 side dishes.

304
00:10:33,548 --> 00:10:34,747
It's a big bang for the buck.

305
00:10:34,748 --> 00:10:37,018
It's happiness in ten dollars.

306
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:39,487
(Rice in a pot, various side dishes, and soup)

307
00:10:39,488 --> 00:10:42,028
(A Korean set menu for ten dollars)

308
00:10:43,058 --> 00:10:45,597
(Where you can experience the old charm...)

309
00:10:45,598 --> 00:10:49,968
(and the heart of the market)

310
00:10:50,798 --> 00:10:56,938
(LMR 1, Korean set menu)

311
00:10:57,438 --> 00:11:00,007
What's fascinating is that the market is upstairs,

312
00:11:00,008 --> 00:11:01,307
so people are coming and going.

313
00:11:01,308 --> 00:11:03,478
The restaurant is right next to the fish market.

314
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:05,447
The food has to be delicious.

315
00:11:05,448 --> 00:11:06,847
Hello.

316
00:11:06,848 --> 00:11:08,747
- My goodness. - Are you the restaurant owner?

317
00:11:08,748 --> 00:11:10,417
- Yes. - Are you the restaurant owner?

318
00:11:10,418 --> 00:11:11,557
- Are you the restaurant owner? - Yes.

319
00:11:11,558 --> 00:11:13,058
Hello.

320
00:11:13,118 --> 00:11:15,728
My goodness, you all look so handsome.

321
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:18,898
- Are you from Jeonju? - It's Korean set menu.

322
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,157
I'm from Deokjin in Jeonju.

323
00:11:20,158 --> 00:11:21,357
(She's from Deokjin, Jeonju.)

324
00:11:21,358 --> 00:11:22,968
Then the food has to be delicious.

325
00:11:23,098 --> 00:11:24,567
The three of us will be eating.

326
00:11:24,568 --> 00:11:26,137
Do you have a special menu for today?

327
00:11:26,138 --> 00:11:27,237
There's only Korean set menu.

328
00:11:27,238 --> 00:11:28,607
That's the menu for today.

329
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:30,007
Is there only one thing on the menu?

330
00:11:30,008 --> 00:11:31,777
I only change the soup.

331
00:11:31,778 --> 00:11:32,977
Also,

332
00:11:32,978 --> 00:11:35,247
the side dishes change every day.

333
00:11:35,248 --> 00:11:36,648
I see.

334
00:11:36,778 --> 00:11:38,917
How many side dishes do you serve?

335
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:40,047
I serve about 11 types.

336
00:11:40,048 --> 00:11:41,747
- That's a lot. - That's so many.

337
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:43,947
How much does it cost?

338
00:11:43,948 --> 00:11:45,757
It's 20 dollars for 2 people.

339
00:11:45,758 --> 00:11:47,157
- It's ten dollars per person. - Yes.

340
00:11:47,158 --> 00:11:48,427
- Is it 20 dollars for 2 people? - Yes.

341
00:11:48,428 --> 00:11:49,457
No matter how much you eat...

342
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,227
I'm curious about what the 11 side dishes are.

343
00:11:51,228 --> 00:11:53,797
Do you get all your ingredients from the market?

344
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:55,698
All the vegetables are fresh at the market.

345
00:11:55,968 --> 00:11:57,997
- That's the best part. - I just need...

346
00:11:57,998 --> 00:12:00,637
to go upstairs to buy fresh vegetables.

347
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:01,707
You're right.

348
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:02,767
That's great.

349
00:12:02,768 --> 00:12:03,907
It's like having a vegetable garden upstairs.

350
00:12:03,908 --> 00:12:04,908
You pick them up.

351
00:12:04,909 --> 00:12:06,037
A vegetable garden?

352
00:12:06,038 --> 00:12:07,277
You can get them right away.

353
00:12:07,278 --> 00:12:08,784
- It's really a vegetable garden. - A vegetable garden.

354
00:12:08,808 --> 00:12:11,147
The three of us will be eating.

355
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:13,148
What do we do about the stew?

356
00:12:13,548 --> 00:12:14,887
We'll get the best stew for today.

357
00:12:14,888 --> 00:12:16,247
Today, cheonggukjang is the best.

358
00:12:16,248 --> 00:12:18,517
I brought deonjang from the countryside.

359
00:12:18,518 --> 00:12:19,557
- It was made at home. - That's perfect.

360
00:12:19,558 --> 00:12:21,527
- To make the stew. - We should get cheonggukjang.

361
00:12:21,528 --> 00:12:22,757
Shall we get three?

362
00:12:22,758 --> 00:12:23,957
- Will you start with 3? - It'd be 30 dollars.

363
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:25,758
- We'll get three orders. - All right.

364
00:12:25,798 --> 00:12:27,058
How about kimchi stew...

365
00:12:27,158 --> 00:12:28,728
- and cheonggukjang? - Okay.

366
00:12:28,868 --> 00:12:30,028
We'll order those.

367
00:12:30,098 --> 00:12:31,698
- Okay. - It's coming right up.

368
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:33,397
It's the best bang for the buck.

369
00:12:33,398 --> 00:12:34,667
Eat as much as you want.

370
00:12:34,668 --> 00:12:36,508
This is really awesome.

371
00:12:37,408 --> 00:12:38,907
One kimchi stew...

372
00:12:38,908 --> 00:12:40,038
and one cheonggukjang.

373
00:12:40,078 --> 00:12:42,648
(Getting the tray ready)

374
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:44,007
(Serving kimchi...)

375
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:45,577
(and seasoned vegetables)

376
00:12:45,578 --> 00:12:47,948
(A colorful array of side dishes...)

377
00:12:48,148 --> 00:12:50,018
(fill up the tray.)

378
00:12:50,118 --> 00:12:54,118
(Adding protein)

379
00:12:54,828 --> 00:12:59,198
(Next is the rice in a pot.)

380
00:12:59,628 --> 00:13:02,768
(Savory cheonggukjang...)

381
00:13:03,198 --> 00:13:06,538
(and Korean's spicy kimchi stew)

382
00:13:06,898 --> 00:13:11,508
(The Korean set menu is ready.)

383
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,607
- It's here. - Hello, your food is here.

384
00:13:13,608 --> 00:13:15,408
- Thank you. - That was quick.

385
00:13:15,578 --> 00:13:16,647
Look at the rice.

386
00:13:16,648 --> 00:13:17,977
- Enjoy your meal. - Thank you.

387
00:13:17,978 --> 00:13:19,677
Is this for three people?

388
00:13:19,678 --> 00:13:20,918
What's this?

389
00:13:20,978 --> 00:13:23,217
- I've never seen it before. - Oh, my.

390
00:13:23,218 --> 00:13:24,857
- Look at this. - That's how they made it?

391
00:13:24,858 --> 00:13:25,858
Look at the seasoning.

392
00:13:25,859 --> 00:13:27,388
The food looks great.

393
00:13:28,088 --> 00:13:29,128
It's ginseng.

394
00:13:29,688 --> 00:13:30,758
Tae Hyun, it's ginseng.

395
00:13:31,428 --> 00:13:32,528
I thought that it was crab.

396
00:13:32,558 --> 00:13:34,398
- It's ginseng. - It's a lot for three people.

397
00:13:34,598 --> 00:13:35,967
Isn't the rice freshly made?

398
00:13:35,968 --> 00:13:37,067
(You can't take your eyes off of it.)

399
00:13:37,068 --> 00:13:38,238
The rice is...

400
00:13:38,768 --> 00:13:40,467
(Standing up automatically)

401
00:13:40,468 --> 00:13:41,684
- Look at the rice. - I thought that it was crab.

402
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,067
- It's ginseng. - It's a lot for three people.

403
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:44,807
The side dishes look amazing.

404
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:46,007
Including the stew,

405
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:47,878
it looks like 14 side dishes.

406
00:13:48,348 --> 00:13:50,108
The rice is perfectly cooked.

407
00:13:51,108 --> 00:13:52,148
This is...

408
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:54,148
the real rice in a pot.

409
00:13:54,178 --> 00:13:55,618
It's not just an imitation.

410
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:58,318
Nurungji is stuck everywhere in the pot.

411
00:14:00,588 --> 00:14:03,028
I'd love to put all the food...

412
00:14:03,128 --> 00:14:04,627
inside the pot.

413
00:14:04,628 --> 00:14:05,998
I'd eat straight from the pot.

414
00:14:06,658 --> 00:14:08,498
- Like bibimbap? - Directly.

415
00:14:08,728 --> 00:14:10,698
(Salivating)

416
00:14:11,098 --> 00:14:13,438
- Here you go. - The stew looks so big.

417
00:14:14,268 --> 00:14:15,937
- Is it really cheonggukjang? - This is...

418
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,498
How much is it for one additional stew?

419
00:14:17,838 --> 00:14:19,077
- It's also 5 dollars for the rice. - It's 5 dollars.

420
00:14:19,078 --> 00:14:21,007
- Five dollars? - Anything supplementary.

421
00:14:21,008 --> 00:14:22,507
This pot is awesome.

422
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:23,878
How much is the side dish refill?

423
00:14:24,148 --> 00:14:25,677
Extra fish is two dollars.

424
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:26,777
This is two dollars?

425
00:14:26,778 --> 00:14:27,778
- You have to pay. - Of course.

426
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:28,847
- We should pay for that. - Two dollars.

427
00:14:28,848 --> 00:14:30,587
- Do you refill others for free? - You can eat other side dishes...

428
00:14:30,588 --> 00:14:31,757
as much as you want.

429
00:14:31,758 --> 00:14:33,518
We bring you more when the plates are empty.

430
00:14:33,588 --> 00:14:35,127
There are eggs too.

431
00:14:35,128 --> 00:14:36,227
Enjoy your food.

432
00:14:36,228 --> 00:14:37,588
Thank you for the food.

433
00:14:37,988 --> 00:14:39,057
Look at this.

434
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:40,334
(Team Korean Set Menu's first target is...)

435
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:42,327
- The meat... - It has to taste good...

436
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:43,697
no matter what.

437
00:14:43,698 --> 00:14:44,768
(Spicy kimchi stew)

438
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:47,197
Anything you make in this pot is good.

439
00:14:47,198 --> 00:14:49,107
- Right. - Ramyeon in this pot tastes good.

440
00:14:49,108 --> 00:14:50,407
- Right? - You make comfort food with it.

441
00:14:50,408 --> 00:14:51,607
Seriously.

442
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:53,608
(Filled with pork and kimchi)

443
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:56,608
Look how big and flat it is.

444
00:14:56,948 --> 00:14:58,378
Look at this.

445
00:14:59,448 --> 00:15:00,817
The color is...

446
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:02,348
(Speechless)

447
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:04,688
- Did you serve yourself? - I did.

448
00:15:05,718 --> 00:15:09,757
(With various vegetables like tofu and zucchini)

449
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:15,468
(Cheonggukjang with the excellent savory taste)

450
00:15:15,868 --> 00:15:17,068
The color is...

451
00:15:17,928 --> 00:15:18,997
(Sighing)

452
00:15:18,998 --> 00:15:20,437
It's harder than I thought.

453
00:15:20,438 --> 00:15:22,678
- Watching them eat... - The naengmyeon expert is upset.

454
00:15:23,168 --> 00:15:24,667
I'm wondering if it's good...

455
00:15:24,668 --> 00:15:26,807
to eat cold noodles on an empty stomach.

456
00:15:26,808 --> 00:15:28,084
(Is it good to eat cold noodles on an empty stomach?)

457
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:30,878
Maybe I was being too rash a moment ago.

458
00:15:31,748 --> 00:15:33,177
- Let's eat. - Look at this.

459
00:15:33,178 --> 00:15:34,847
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

460
00:15:34,848 --> 00:15:36,218
Thank you for the food.

461
00:15:36,248 --> 00:15:37,347
Let's eat.

462
00:15:37,348 --> 00:15:38,417
(The side dishes to help with today's meal)

463
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:39,517
(Marinated crab, kimchi stew, mackerel, cheonggukjang, )

464
00:15:39,518 --> 00:15:41,464
(white radish salad, potatoes, anchovies, ginseng, zucchini...)

465
00:15:41,488 --> 00:15:44,587
(Tasting the kimchi stew first)

466
00:15:44,588 --> 00:15:46,458
(Impressed)

467
00:15:53,438 --> 00:15:54,467
Is it good?

468
00:15:54,468 --> 00:15:56,238
- It's spicy. - Is it spicy?

469
00:15:56,308 --> 00:15:57,367
Totally.

470
00:15:57,368 --> 00:15:58,608
(It's totally spicy.)

471
00:15:59,678 --> 00:16:04,008
(Sang Uk tastes the cheonggukjang.)

472
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:06,678
(Exclaiming)

473
00:16:07,318 --> 00:16:08,518
My goodness.

474
00:16:10,318 --> 00:16:11,718
The cheonggukjang.

475
00:16:12,158 --> 00:16:13,487
The cheonggukjang is awesome.

476
00:16:13,488 --> 00:16:15,088
- Every side dish... - Isn't it awesome?

477
00:16:16,228 --> 00:16:17,428
Isn't it very rich?

478
00:16:18,128 --> 00:16:20,127
Everything tastes so good.

479
00:16:20,128 --> 00:16:21,197
(They can't stop looking at them eating again today.)

480
00:16:21,198 --> 00:16:22,567
It's very rich.

481
00:16:22,568 --> 00:16:24,068
My goodness.

482
00:16:24,228 --> 00:16:26,197
Sang Uk, hurry up...

483
00:16:26,198 --> 00:16:28,407
and scold that kimchi and other side dishes.

484
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:29,888
(Scold kimchi and other side dishes.)

485
00:16:30,838 --> 00:16:34,407
(A big spoonful of fried egg and rice)

486
00:16:34,408 --> 00:16:35,577
Sang Uk is eating well.

487
00:16:35,578 --> 00:16:36,878
Thank you.

488
00:16:38,478 --> 00:16:39,647
Eat some kimchi...

489
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:40,648
and young radish kimchi.

490
00:16:40,649 --> 00:16:41,969
Eat some cucumber kimchi already.

491
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:43,988
The zucchini is waiting.

492
00:16:44,318 --> 00:16:45,387
The kimchi is really...

493
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:46,687
Yes, the zucchini is waiting.

494
00:16:46,688 --> 00:16:48,117
Sang Uk, this is very good.

495
00:16:48,118 --> 00:16:49,327
- I recommend it. - Is it seaweed?

496
00:16:49,328 --> 00:16:50,787
- It looks like sweet potato stems. - Sweet potato stems?

497
00:16:50,788 --> 00:16:51,858
Perilla seeds...

498
00:16:52,598 --> 00:16:54,327
- The cucumber kimchi... - Okay.

499
00:16:54,328 --> 00:16:58,198
(He also finishes devouring sweet potato stems.)

500
00:16:59,098 --> 00:17:00,437
I'll make a delicious wrap.

501
00:17:00,438 --> 00:17:01,784
(Dong Hyun is attacking the kimchi stew.)

502
00:17:01,808 --> 00:17:03,837
With eggs and kimchi.

503
00:17:03,838 --> 00:17:06,478
(A combination of kimchi from kimchi stew and fried egg)

504
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:08,847
You know the broth that comes out from it?

505
00:17:08,848 --> 00:17:09,907
(Humming)

506
00:17:09,908 --> 00:17:10,978
The broth.

507
00:17:11,148 --> 00:17:12,347
I'll take a sip of the broth.

508
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:17,318
(Drinking the broth directly from the bowl)

509
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:21,258
I'm salivating buckets.

510
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,827
The order of eating is...

511
00:17:23,828 --> 00:17:26,828
- more important than the food. - You're right.

512
00:17:26,898 --> 00:17:29,267
- That's the most important. - What you eat isn't important.

513
00:17:29,268 --> 00:17:30,897
- Eating first is the best. - That's exactly right.

514
00:17:30,898 --> 00:17:32,744
(The truth he realized within 20 minutes of the shoot)

515
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:33,768
(That's probably because...)

516
00:17:33,769 --> 00:17:36,338
(he's always looking this way.)

517
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,907
(Because of the one who keeps teasing him)

518
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:41,008
This is impossible for ten dollars.

519
00:17:41,878 --> 00:17:44,508
(Staring)

520
00:17:44,908 --> 00:17:46,628
Dong Hyun makes the food look so delicious.

521
00:17:49,218 --> 00:17:51,448
This is what I'm experiencing.

522
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,018
I have to taste different side dishes,

523
00:17:54,388 --> 00:17:56,868
but once I taste one, I fall in love and can't stop eating it.

524
00:17:57,728 --> 00:17:58,898
Then the rice is gone.

525
00:18:00,558 --> 00:18:02,098
If a woman proposes to me...

526
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:04,497
with this food,

527
00:18:04,498 --> 00:18:05,538
I'd say yes.

528
00:18:07,268 --> 00:18:08,708
I don't need rings or anything else.

529
00:18:08,768 --> 00:18:10,667
All I need is this.

530
00:18:10,668 --> 00:18:11,914
(He prefers rice with 12 side dishes to wedding presents.)

531
00:18:11,938 --> 00:18:14,638
(On the other hand, the quiet gourmet Tae Hyun)

532
00:18:14,738 --> 00:18:17,478
(He's busy eating like the others.)

533
00:18:17,648 --> 00:18:19,978
(Try this.)

534
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:22,288
(Exclaiming)

535
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,588
I've had...

536
00:18:23,918 --> 00:18:25,048
a lot of deodeok...

537
00:18:26,018 --> 00:18:29,228
with this seasoning, but not ginseng.

538
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:31,458
(Seasoned ginseng to bring back your lost appetite)

539
00:18:31,459 --> 00:18:32,558
You can only find it here.

540
00:18:34,598 --> 00:18:37,198
I'd like that on top of white rice.

541
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:42,108
(Sang Uk takes a bite of the seasoned ginseng.)

542
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:44,438
Isn't it good?

543
00:18:44,668 --> 00:18:46,807
- This is... - This is...

544
00:18:46,808 --> 00:18:48,007
picked fresh from the mountain.

545
00:18:48,008 --> 00:18:49,078
This is...

546
00:18:49,578 --> 00:18:50,908
How much would it be?

547
00:18:52,118 --> 00:18:53,998
Doesn't the ginseng cost ten dollars by itself?

548
00:18:54,218 --> 00:18:56,587
Considering the prices these days, this can't be ten dollars.

549
00:18:56,588 --> 00:18:57,788
Look at the variety of food.

550
00:18:59,358 --> 00:19:00,757
The ginseng is insane.

551
00:19:00,758 --> 00:19:01,858
(Carefully)

552
00:19:02,028 --> 00:19:03,088
By the way...

553
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:07,127
For a while, I thought that this was so cute on Dong Hyun.

554
00:19:07,128 --> 00:19:08,197
I'm sorry for disturbing your meal.

555
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:09,998
Can you lower your head a little?

556
00:19:10,168 --> 00:19:12,138
Can you lower your head a little?

557
00:19:12,168 --> 00:19:13,638
This is so adorable.

558
00:19:13,968 --> 00:19:15,097
Are you a Teletubby?

559
00:19:15,098 --> 00:19:16,968
- Isn't it going up? - He's a Teletubby.

560
00:19:17,268 --> 00:19:18,978
- Look to the front. - This is...

561
00:19:19,108 --> 00:19:22,307
Does it stand up when you eat something delicious?

562
00:19:22,308 --> 00:19:23,807
I put a lot of spray on it to keep it down.

563
00:19:23,808 --> 00:19:25,778
It came back up because I sweated from eating.

564
00:19:27,048 --> 00:19:29,417
- Only that strand of hair stood up. - Right.

565
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:30,858
It's a signal for tasty restaurants.

566
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:32,758
It calls for more rice.

567
00:19:33,518 --> 00:19:35,527
When a side dish isn't good,

568
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:36,528
you don't want to eat it.

569
00:19:36,529 --> 00:19:37,927
Each side dish is insanely good.

570
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:38,928
- Everything is good. - I agree.
(They can't stop eating.)

571
00:19:40,598 --> 00:19:43,398
If you eat a spoonful with a bite, how many rice bowls can you eat?

572
00:19:44,298 --> 00:19:47,267
If I could, I'd eat three bowls.

573
00:19:47,268 --> 00:19:48,908
- Definitely. - If I could eat that much.

574
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:51,138
The side dish quality is that high.

575
00:19:51,638 --> 00:19:52,677
Everything tastes good.

576
00:19:52,678 --> 00:19:54,608
(High-quality food that calls for rice)

577
00:19:56,148 --> 00:19:57,208
Look at the nurungji.

578
00:19:57,478 --> 00:19:58,507
I took it all off.

579
00:19:58,508 --> 00:19:59,917
(The highlight of rice in a pot, nurungji)

580
00:19:59,918 --> 00:20:01,918
- It looks very good. - Didn't I take it off well?

581
00:20:02,548 --> 00:20:03,748
When I get nurungji like this,

582
00:20:04,088 --> 00:20:06,058
I leave some room in my stomach.

583
00:20:06,588 --> 00:20:11,358
(The big eater Moon Se Yoon's important lesson)

584
00:20:12,728 --> 00:20:15,397
(That's how it started.)

585
00:20:15,398 --> 00:20:16,398
Okay.

586
00:20:16,768 --> 00:20:17,797
Thank you.

587

(he eats some nurungji.)

592
00:20:34,848 --> 00:20:39,318
(Drinking straight from the bowl)

593
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:40,618
You know what?

594
00:20:40,918 --> 00:20:43,457
It feels like I'm eating at home...

595
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,727
before the shoot.

596
00:20:44,728 --> 00:20:45,828
You're right.

597
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:48,258
I just need to go to work after brushing my teeth.

598
00:20:49,568 --> 00:20:51,498
Are you going to work now?

599
00:20:52,368 --> 00:20:55,097
Yes, this is exactly my routine.

600
00:20:55,098 --> 00:20:56,108
I feel like I'm home.

601
00:20:56,468 --> 00:20:59,437
If this is breakfast, I would brush my teeth and go to work.

602
00:20:59,438 --> 00:21:02,248
If this is dinner, I would sleep soon.

603
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:05,247
- I'd turn on the TV and lie down. - A simple life.

604
00:21:05,248 --> 00:21:06,648
- My goodness. - That's the best.

605
00:21:07,778 --> 00:21:10,548
Can you give it to us now?

606
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:14,217
Only 1 of the 3 will eat.

607
00:21:14,218 --> 00:21:15,218
(One from Team Naengmyeon will be saved.)

608
00:21:15,219 --> 00:21:16,888
Here's a famous quote quiz.

609
00:21:18,158 --> 00:21:21,828
"Love and this cannot be hidden."

610
00:21:22,398 --> 00:21:25,337
- "Love?" - "Love and this cannot be hidden."

611
00:21:25,338 --> 00:21:26,338
Yes.

612
00:21:27,898 --> 00:21:28,938
I know.

613
00:21:31,068 --> 00:21:32,638
- Hatred. - Hatred.

614
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:34,478
Incorrect.

615
00:21:35,448 --> 00:21:36,448
- I know. - Yes?

616
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:37,748
- Lies. - Lies?

617
00:21:38,278 --> 00:21:39,278
Incorrect.

618
00:21:39,918 --> 00:21:42,748
(Thinking)

619
00:21:43,748 --> 00:21:45,558
I think it's 1 of these 2.

620
00:21:45,818 --> 00:21:46,818
What are the two?

621
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:49,658
I think it's either cough or sneeze.

622
00:21:49,888 --> 00:21:51,757
That sounds correct.

623
00:21:51,758 --> 00:21:56,267
In English, "There are two things that you can't hide."

624
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:57,268
Yes?

625
00:21:57,968 --> 00:22:00,197
A cough and love.

626
00:22:00,198 --> 00:22:01,868
A sneeze and love.

627
00:22:01,968 --> 00:22:04,667
Which word would sound better in a famous quote?

628
00:22:04,668 --> 00:22:06,908
Then it's cough. Both of them have two syllables.

629
00:22:07,378 --> 00:22:10,147
- What? - Cough with two syllables.

630
00:22:10,148 --> 00:22:11,247
But it should be in English.

631
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:12,317
(Inhaling)

632
00:22:12,318 --> 00:22:13,638
You're better at English than me.

633
00:22:14,218 --> 00:22:15,498
I don't know much about English.

634
00:22:16,248 --> 00:22:18,318
- What's sneeze in English? - Sneeze.

635
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,217
- What about cough? - Cough.

636
00:22:20,218 --> 00:22:21,917
- It's cough. It has two syllables. - Cough.

637
00:22:21,918 --> 00:22:23,127
Love, cough.

638
00:22:23,128 --> 00:22:24,327
- Love and cough? - Yes.

639
00:22:24,328 --> 00:22:25,858
- They even rhyme. - Exactly.

640
00:22:26,198 --> 00:22:27,198
Cough.

641
00:22:27,558 --> 00:22:30,097
"Love and a cough cannot be hidden?"

642
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,098
They can't be hidden.

643
00:22:33,398 --> 00:22:34,398
Correct.

644
00:22:35,068 --> 00:22:36,537
- Didn't I do well? - You assisted me.

645
00:22:36,538 --> 00:22:38,167
- Didn't I do well? Why am I happy? - You assisted me.

646
00:22:38,168 --> 00:22:40,207
- Your English answer was exact. - Love and cough.

647
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:41,378
- Hey. - Wasn't I right?

648
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:43,308
You were amazing.

649
00:22:44,908 --> 00:22:46,317
- Do you want a bite? - Yes.

650
00:22:46,318 --> 00:22:47,418
Sit here.

651
00:22:48,318 --> 00:22:51,088
The zucchini is excellent.

652
00:22:51,448 --> 00:22:54,288
Try these in this order.

653
00:22:55,188 --> 00:22:56,258
All of these?

654
00:22:56,428 --> 00:22:58,827
- Eat them in this order. - Okay. For now...

655
00:22:58,828 --> 00:23:00,028
His heart must be fluttering.

656
00:23:00,558 --> 00:23:01,878
The naengmyeon expert is excited.

657
00:23:02,228 --> 00:23:03,898
- Seung Ho's favorite. - This too.

658
00:23:04,328 --> 00:23:06,367
- John, this is tasty. - Wait.

659
00:23:06,368 --> 00:23:08,528
(Starting with Seung Ho's favorite sweet potato stems)

660
00:23:08,968 --> 00:23:11,508
(All in one bite)

661
00:23:11,808 --> 00:23:13,737
That should be creamy.

662
00:23:13,738 --> 00:23:15,007
(The taste makes him smile.)

663
00:23:15,008 --> 00:23:16,048
How is it?

664
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:17,907
Taking one bite made me think...

665
00:23:17,908 --> 00:23:19,078
that I should save my rice.

666
00:23:20,078 --> 00:23:21,147
(What's his next goal?)

667
00:23:21,148 --> 00:23:22,517
- Now... - Did you try the sungnyung?

668
00:23:22,518 --> 00:23:25,757
You can make a wrap with it because it isn't so salty.

(Seasoned ginseng that impressed Team Korean Set Menu)

670
00:23:26,818 --> 00:23:29,758
- It's delicious. - I only eat when it's tasty.

671
00:23:31,388 --> 00:23:34,658
(Smiling)

672
00:23:34,828 --> 00:23:36,398
The ginseng is slightly bitter,

673
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:39,597
but the seasoning is sweet and spicy.

674
00:23:39,598 --> 00:23:41,468
(Gently)

675
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:43,438
This is an insane side dish.

676
00:23:44,168 --> 00:23:46,307
I should come back here to eat.

677
00:23:46,308 --> 00:23:47,708
The cucumber kimchi is good too.

678
00:23:48,008 --> 00:23:49,848
It's nice and mushy.

679
00:23:50,308 --> 00:23:51,808
- It must be very ripe. - It's not...

680
00:23:51,908 --> 00:23:54,478
very crunchy, but...

681
00:23:56,048 --> 00:23:58,147
- I emptied the bowl. - Completely.

682
00:23:58,148 --> 00:23:59,268
What he ate was substantial.

683
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,834
The cheonggukjang was insanely good.

684
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:02,427
It's rare to find home-cooked meal...

685
00:24:02,428 --> 00:24:05,157
at a Korean set menu restaurant.

686
00:24:05,158 --> 00:24:07,058
- Right. - Every dish tasted...

687
00:24:07,298 --> 00:24:09,597
like my grandmother's cooking.

688
00:24:09,598 --> 00:24:12,438
Is your grandmother Korean?

689
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,938
(Laughing)

690
00:24:14,768 --> 00:24:16,108
It's good that you aren't biased.

691
00:24:17,338 --> 00:24:19,607
- I ask because I really don't know. - She was Korean.

692
00:24:19,608 --> 00:24:21,937
I came to Korea after being born in the US.

693
00:24:21,938 --> 00:24:23,677
- It's the opposite. - What's your name...

694
00:24:23,678 --> 00:24:24,808
on your Korean ID card?

695
00:24:25,518 --> 00:24:27,217
It says "Park John Andrew."

696
00:24:27,218 --> 00:24:28,477
Why is your name...

697
00:24:28,478 --> 00:24:29,838
Why do you have two English names?

698
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:35,627
Andrew is my middle name. It's like...

699
00:24:35,628 --> 00:24:37,188
(Did he understand?)

700
00:24:37,328 --> 00:24:39,298
- So you have three names. - Yes.

701
00:24:39,928 --> 00:24:41,198
Let's just say that.

702
00:24:42,098 --> 00:24:43,928
That must be inconvenient.

703
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:46,368
(Laughing)

704
00:24:46,738 --> 00:24:48,067
Let's pay the bill.

705
00:24:48,068 --> 00:24:49,068
(The meal is over.)

706
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:50,507
(How much is the total?)

707
00:24:50,508 --> 00:24:51,938
This is really incredible.

708
00:24:52,278 --> 00:24:53,438
It's 35 dollars.

709
00:24:53,608 --> 00:24:55,307
- She only added one extra. - Really?

710
00:24:55,308 --> 00:24:57,578
- But... - She only added one extra rice.

711
00:24:57,848 --> 00:25:01,047
(Total: 35 dollars)

712
00:25:01,048 --> 00:25:02,077
This is nothing.

713
00:25:02,078 --> 00:25:03,948
Let's do it without stressing out.

714
00:25:04,248 --> 00:25:06,757
Guys, do you know that food can also be paired?

715
00:25:06,758 --> 00:25:07,858
- Yes. - Of course.

716
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,487
Among the following options...

717
00:25:10,488 --> 00:25:11,634
It's a multiple-choice question.

718
00:25:11,658 --> 00:25:15,358
What is the most nutritionally complementary pairing?

719
00:25:15,458 --> 00:25:17,527
- Nutritions? - Nutritionally...

720
00:25:17,528 --> 00:25:18,827
- Nutritions. - complementary pairing.

721
00:25:18,828 --> 00:25:20,398
- We got it. - I know a few.

722
00:25:21,398 --> 00:25:24,138
Number one, beef and chestnut.

723
00:25:24,568 --> 00:25:26,037
- Beef and... - Chestnut.

724
00:25:26,038 --> 00:25:27,608
- Chestnut? - I think I saw this.

725
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:29,278
They sound complementary.

726
00:25:29,548 --> 00:25:30,548
Number two.

727
00:25:31,278 --> 00:25:33,347
Mackerel and radish.

728
00:25:33,348 --> 00:25:34,477
- Mackerel and radish. - Yes.

729
00:25:34,478 --> 00:25:36,688
- Braised mackerel with radish. - Right.

730
00:25:36,788 --> 00:25:39,788
Number three, beer and peanuts.

731
00:25:41,088 --> 00:25:44,288
Number four, carrot and cucumber.

732
00:25:44,728 --> 00:25:45,758
This is so easy.

733
00:25:45,898 --> 00:25:48,357
First of all, is beer nutritious?

734
00:25:48,358 --> 00:25:50,127
When it comes to nutrition,

735
00:25:50,128 --> 00:25:51,228
there can't be any alcohol.

736
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:53,437
- Yes. - Right, I agree with you.

737
00:25:53,438 --> 00:25:54,998
I don't think it's beer and peanuts.

738
00:25:55,468 --> 00:25:58,608
There's braised mackerel with radish.

739
00:25:59,338 --> 00:26:01,138
Sometimes, mackerel is served...

740
00:26:01,308 --> 00:26:04,207
with some radish juice. Isn't it?

741
00:26:04,208 --> 00:26:05,208
You're right.

742
00:26:05,209 --> 00:26:06,818
I've never had beef with chestnuts.

743
00:26:07,218 --> 00:26:10,488
Isn't there chestnut wrapped in bacon?

744
00:26:10,818 --> 00:26:13,687
- Tae Hyun. - Was it with bacon?

745
00:26:13,688 --> 00:26:14,887
- Mackerel? - Let's just do it fast.

746
00:26:14,888 --> 00:26:16,227
- Let's go with mackerel. - Mackerel and radish.

747
00:26:16,228 --> 00:26:18,057
- Mackerel and radish. - Number two.

748
00:26:18,058 --> 00:26:19,528
You want to answer this quickly?

749
00:26:19,658 --> 00:26:22,057
- The total isn't expensive. - Exactly.

750
00:26:22,058 --> 00:26:24,097
If we get it wrong, we can pay.

751
00:26:24,098 --> 00:26:25,798
- Yes, mackerel and radish. - Omega-3.

752
00:26:26,998 --> 00:26:29,307
All right, the answer is...

753
00:26:29,308 --> 00:26:31,228
(They spent the least amount of time to answer.)

754
00:26:31,308 --> 00:26:32,837
I hope that it's correct.

755
00:26:32,838 --> 00:26:34,878
- It would make us happy. - So that they can pay.

756
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:35,802
It must be correct.

757
00:26:36,205 --> 00:26:37,644
I hope that it's correct.

758
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:39,675
- It would make us happy. - So that they can pay.

759
00:26:40,045 --> 00:26:41,644
- It must be correct. - Correct.

760
00:26:41,645 --> 00:26:43,284
(Number 2, mackerel and radish)

761
00:26:43,285 --> 00:26:45,185
I'm so happy.

762
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:47,685
The three of you should pick now.

763
00:26:48,415 --> 00:26:49,585
This is...

764
00:26:49,755 --> 00:26:52,085
It's all about the vibe.

765
00:26:52,425 --> 00:26:54,054
It had to be mackerel and radish.

766
00:26:54,055 --> 00:26:55,615
It's nice that you answered so quickly.

767
00:26:55,825 --> 00:26:58,025
Let's hurry up so that we can get naengmyeon.

768
00:26:58,495 --> 00:27:00,765
- It's complete the proverb. - Proverb? I'm doomed.

769
00:27:01,865 --> 00:27:04,305
"The wind blows when you sell A."

770
00:27:05,005 --> 00:27:06,975
"It rains when you sell B."

771
00:27:07,605 --> 00:27:09,204
You'll be exempted from paying if you get it correct.

772
00:27:09,205 --> 00:27:11,165
(The one to guess either A or B first won't pay.)

773
00:27:11,405 --> 00:27:12,544
I know. A, umbrellas.

774
00:27:12,545 --> 00:27:13,774
(The wind blows when you sell A. It rains when you sell B.)

775
00:27:13,775 --> 00:27:15,244
(Answer: A, umbrellas)

776
00:27:15,245 --> 00:27:16,315
A, umbrellas.

777
00:27:16,845 --> 00:27:18,485
- Incorrect. - That sounds reasonable.

778
00:27:19,615 --> 00:27:21,755
(Thinking)

779
00:27:21,955 --> 00:27:23,625
I know. A.

780
00:27:24,725 --> 00:27:26,294
- Raincoats. - Raincoats.

781
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:27,594
(Answer: A, raincoats)

782
00:27:27,595 --> 00:27:28,625
Incorrect.

783
00:27:28,895 --> 00:27:30,664
- A, vegetables. - Incorrect.

784
00:27:30,665 --> 00:27:31,765
Is that it?

785
00:27:31,895 --> 00:27:33,664
I'd know when I hear this.

786
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:34,894
- Coming up with the answer... - I know.

787
00:27:34,895 --> 00:27:37,404
You spread out something to sell.

788
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,074
It could be something that gets blown easily in the wind.

789
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:40,775
I see. That's what it means.

790
00:27:41,635 --> 00:27:42,845
A, chili powder?

791
00:27:44,305 --> 00:27:45,544
- A, chili powder? - Yes.

792
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:46,645
(Could it be correct?)

793
00:27:46,975 --> 00:27:49,114
(The wind blows when you sell chili powder.)

794
00:27:49,115 --> 00:27:50,744
- Incorrect. - Chili powder must be...

795
00:27:50,745 --> 00:27:52,415
close to the answer.

796
00:27:52,815 --> 00:27:55,155
(Thinking)

797
00:27:56,585 --> 00:27:57,725
A, flour.

798
00:27:58,255 --> 00:27:59,294
Flour?

799
00:27:59,295 --> 00:28:01,424
(The wind blows when you sell flour.)

800
00:28:01,425 --> 00:28:02,565
Correct.

801
00:28:02,925 --> 00:28:04,024
That's right.

802
00:28:04,025 --> 00:28:06,394
(Seung Ho is exempt from paying.)

803
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:07,464
It must be something like that.

804
00:28:07,465 --> 00:28:09,335
Because flour gets blown away easily?

805
00:28:10,365 --> 00:28:11,504
B must be...

806
00:28:11,505 --> 00:28:13,905
- It must be something like that. - B.

807
00:28:14,135 --> 00:28:15,335
- Salt. - Salt?

808
00:28:15,475 --> 00:28:17,674
(It rains when you sell salt.)

809
00:28:17,675 --> 00:28:18,705
Correct.

810
00:28:19,345 --> 00:28:20,714
It's Yi Kyung. It's been a long time.

811
00:28:20,715 --> 00:28:22,944
I'll make you remember me at Gyeongdong Market.

812
00:28:22,945 --> 00:28:23,945
Okay.

813
00:28:23,946 --> 00:28:25,466
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

814
00:28:26,015 --> 00:28:28,084
(Total: 35 dollars)

815
00:28:28,085 --> 00:28:30,655
- Thank you. - Here you go. Thank you.

816
00:28:31,425 --> 00:28:32,695
It was so cost-effective.

817
00:28:33,455 --> 00:28:35,594
We saw about two percent of Gyeongdong Market.

818
00:28:35,595 --> 00:28:37,365
What? We only saw two percent?

819
00:28:37,525 --> 00:28:38,794
This is only the entrance.

820
00:28:38,795 --> 00:28:40,795
(Going inside Gyeongdong Market now)

821
00:28:41,595 --> 00:28:44,164
(Grabbing their attention)

822
00:28:44,165 --> 00:28:45,165
Look at that.

823
00:28:45,835 --> 00:28:49,205
(Walking along the warm and nostalgic market street)

824
00:28:50,005 --> 00:28:57,045
(You'll be caught by a parade of tempting street food.)

825
00:28:58,015 --> 00:28:59,555
It's a paradise of food.

826
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:04,824
(While resisting the temptation and heading for naengmyeon)

827
00:29:04,825 --> 00:29:06,495
Are you here to shoot Handsome Guys?

828
00:29:06,795 --> 00:29:08,424
(A citizen recognized Handsome Guys.)

829
00:29:08,425 --> 00:29:10,164
Yes, how did you know?

830
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:11,294
I watch it all the time.

831
00:29:11,295 --> 00:29:12,464
- Really? - Yes.

832
00:29:12,465 --> 00:29:14,064
- Thank you so much. - You look handsome.

833
00:29:14,065 --> 00:29:15,835
We're here for a shoot. Thank you, ma'am.

834
00:29:16,065 --> 00:29:17,304
- Please be healthy. - You look handsome.

835
00:29:17,305 --> 00:29:18,305
Thank you.

836
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:19,434
(Feeling proud)

837
00:29:19,435 --> 00:29:20,575
An old lady asked,

838
00:29:20,805 --> 00:29:23,204
"Are you here to shoot Handsome Guys?"

839
00:29:23,205 --> 00:29:24,205
Really?

840
00:29:24,206 --> 00:29:25,975
I got startled and thanked her.

841
00:29:27,045 --> 00:29:28,645
This place is huge.

842
00:29:29,075 --> 00:29:30,615
Isn't it the biggest market in Seoul?

843
00:29:31,215 --> 00:29:32,684
- It's the biggest market in Seoul. - It's big.

844
00:29:32,685 --> 00:29:33,755
Right?

845
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:35,685
This place is enormous.

846
00:29:36,855 --> 00:29:38,724
- It has everything. - It's really big.

847
00:29:38,725 --> 00:29:39,854
(In awe)

848
00:29:39,855 --> 00:29:41,194
- Are these types of chili powder? - Yes.

849
00:29:41,195 --> 00:29:42,741
- Each has a different use. - Are you shooting Handsome Guys?

850
00:29:42,765 --> 00:29:43,794
- Thank you. - Handsome Guys.

851
00:29:43,795 --> 00:29:44,824
Thank you.

852
00:29:44,825 --> 00:29:46,364
(Another citizen recognized them.)

853
00:29:46,365 --> 00:29:48,365
- I can't believe she knows. - That's fascinating.

854
00:29:48,835 --> 00:29:50,155
"Are you shooting Handsome Guys?"

855
00:29:50,365 --> 00:29:51,965
We must be popular at the market.

856
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:53,975
This must be the place.

857
00:29:55,375 --> 00:29:56,375
- Oh, my. - In this building?

858
00:29:56,376 --> 00:29:57,904
This is the naengmyeon restaurant.

859
00:29:57,905 --> 00:29:59,044
(They arrive at the second LMR restaurant.)

860
00:29:59,045 --> 00:30:01,175
- Hello. - Hello.

861
00:30:01,375 --> 00:30:03,514
- It's a really old restaurant. - It's amazing.

862
00:30:03,515 --> 00:30:06,184
(Buckwheat naengmyeon)

863
00:30:06,185 --> 00:30:07,454
I like the exterior.

864
00:30:07,455 --> 00:30:09,155
- May we come in? - Please come in.

865
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:14,755
(A place that most people know about)

866
00:30:14,995 --> 00:30:17,595
When I ran a business ten years ago,

867
00:30:17,725 --> 00:30:19,494
I came here often.

868
00:30:19,495 --> 00:30:22,365
I started eating Pyongyang naengmyeon not so long ago.

869
00:30:22,665 --> 00:30:26,374
It's a good place for beginners.

870
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:28,874
Their Pyongyang naengmyeon has a stronger taste than the average.

871
00:30:28,875 --> 00:30:29,875
(Pyongyang naengmyeon with a strong taste)

872
00:30:29,876 --> 00:30:30,945
It was really good.

873
00:30:31,345 --> 00:30:33,015
It made me crave a drink.

874
00:30:34,545 --> 00:30:38,115
(LMR 2, naengmyeon)

875
00:30:38,385 --> 00:30:40,666
You're a naengmyeon expert. Is this your first time here?

876
00:30:40,785 --> 00:30:42,801
- It's my first time. - He can't come all the way here.

877
00:30:42,825 --> 00:30:44,154
On our way here,

878
00:30:44,155 --> 00:30:46,255
did you see the two elders outside?

879
00:30:46,325 --> 00:30:48,125
One of the men did this while eating.

880
00:30:48,525 --> 00:30:50,624
(Showing a thumbs-up silently)

881
00:30:50,625 --> 00:30:51,625
I didn't say anything.

882
00:30:51,626 --> 00:30:52,964
To say that this is a tasty restaurant.

883
00:30:52,965 --> 00:30:54,194
He was welcoming us.

884
00:30:54,195 --> 00:30:56,734
The energy from his thumbs-up was incredible.

885
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:57,905
He didn't even smile.

886
00:30:58,365 --> 00:31:00,404
(One hand gesture increases their anticipation by a lot.)

887
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:01,705
All right.

888
00:31:01,805 --> 00:31:03,845
- Hello. - Hello.

889
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:05,975
My restaurant is so shabby.

890
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:07,674
- Not at all. - It's not shabby.

891
00:31:07,675 --> 00:31:09,491
How long have you been running this restaurant?

892
00:31:09,515 --> 00:31:12,014
It's been 66 years.

893
00:31:12,015 --> 00:31:13,354
(Exclaiming)

894
00:31:13,355 --> 00:31:16,524
I'm the fifth restaurant owner.

895
00:31:16,525 --> 00:31:18,084
(The 5th owner at a restaurant of 66 years)

896
00:31:18,085 --> 00:31:21,354
Are the customers mostly tourists...

897
00:31:21,355 --> 00:31:22,894
or merchants?

898
00:31:22,895 --> 00:31:25,765
Some people have been coming here for 40 to 50 years.

899
00:31:26,565 --> 00:31:29,365
The oldest frequent customer has been coming here for 65 years.

900
00:31:29,965 --> 00:31:31,264
- Really? - As soon as it opened?

901
00:31:31,265 --> 00:31:32,875
- He used to work... - Sixty-five years?

902
00:31:32,935 --> 00:31:36,305
As a reporter in the press.

903
00:31:36,905 --> 00:31:38,745
When he was attending Kyung Hee University,

904
00:31:38,845 --> 00:31:41,444
he came here to eat. He still comes now.

905
00:31:41,445 --> 00:31:42,884
He must be in his 80s.

906
00:31:42,885 --> 00:31:44,444
- He's in his 90s. - In his 90s?

907
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:46,655
- He's in his 90s. - This place has history.

908
00:31:48,055 --> 00:31:51,054
(What kind of naengmyeon boasts such long history?)

909
00:31:51,055 --> 00:31:52,555
Is your naengmyeon...

910
00:31:52,585 --> 00:31:55,324
Pyongyang naengmyeon or Hamheung naengmyeon?

911
00:31:55,325 --> 00:31:57,694
- Ours is buckwheat naengmyeon. - Buckwheat naengmyeon?

912
00:31:57,695 --> 00:32:00,965
Buckwheat naengmyeon is very hard to make.

913
00:32:01,595 --> 00:32:03,435
The mix has to be precise.

914
00:32:03,735 --> 00:32:05,534
What's the ratio of buckwheat and starch?

915
00:32:05,535 --> 00:32:09,074
It's made with four types.

916
00:32:09,075 --> 00:32:10,105
I see.

917
00:32:10,205 --> 00:32:12,574
About 30 percent is buckwheat.

918
00:32:12,575 --> 00:32:15,475
It must be plump and chewy.

919
00:32:15,845 --> 00:32:17,184
You're really an expert.

920
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,944
That's why it's called naengmyeon.

921
00:32:18,945 --> 00:32:19,985
I see.

922
00:32:20,015 --> 00:32:22,315
What should we order here?

923
00:32:22,355 --> 00:32:23,355
We have...

924
00:32:23,356 --> 00:32:24,754
Should we get special naengmyeon?

925
00:32:24,755 --> 00:32:26,525
Please take a look at the menu.

926
00:32:26,655 --> 00:32:29,255
We have mul naengmyeon and bibim naengmyeon.

927
00:32:29,565 --> 00:32:32,165
I came up with a special dish with perilla oil.

928
00:32:32,265 --> 00:32:33,564
- Perilla oil? - Goodness.

929
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:35,434
- Perilla oil is excellent. - About 9 out of 10 people...

930
00:32:35,435 --> 00:32:37,904
ask for the dish with perilla oil.

931
00:32:37,905 --> 00:32:39,504
Really?

932
00:32:39,505 --> 00:32:42,604
Do you get the perilla oil from the market?

933
00:32:42,605 --> 00:32:45,145
Yes, around Gyeongdong Market,

934
00:32:45,545 --> 00:32:48,075
there are about 100 oil stores.

935
00:32:48,145 --> 00:32:52,144
I've lived in this neighborhood for 45 years,

936
00:32:52,145 --> 00:32:53,984
- Yes? - so I know a good place.

937
00:32:53,985 --> 00:32:55,854
We should try the naengmyeon with perilla oil.

938
00:32:55,855 --> 00:32:57,154
Let's put it in the middle and share it.

939
00:32:57,155 --> 00:33:01,525
Also, I'm not asking for your opinion on this.

940
00:33:02,025 --> 00:33:03,941
- Order the boiled meat. - I want a large plate.

941
00:33:03,965 --> 00:33:05,125
Go ahead.

942
00:33:05,165 --> 00:33:06,495
- He's determined. - Yes.

943
00:33:06,695 --> 00:33:07,764
Go ahead.

944
00:33:07,765 --> 00:33:09,095
(Bursting out laughing)

945
00:33:10,165 --> 00:33:11,165
- Okay. - He wants it.

946
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:13,475
Two mul naengmyeon,

947
00:33:13,635 --> 00:33:16,644
two bibim naengmyeon with perilla oil, one large boiled meat.

948
00:33:16,645 --> 00:33:18,504
- Okay, thank you. - Thank you.

949
00:33:18,505 --> 00:33:19,615
- Thank you. - Thank you.

950
00:33:20,275 --> 00:33:21,315
Thank you.

951
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:23,445
Warm broth is nice at a naengmyeon restaurant.

952
00:33:27,415 --> 00:33:28,454
Is it noodle water?

953
00:33:28,455 --> 00:33:29,761
- It's noodle water. - Noodle water?

954
00:33:29,785 --> 00:33:31,655
Noodle water that's slightly seasoned.

955
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:34,724
You're right.

956
00:33:34,725 --> 00:33:36,865
Did he mix a broth with noodle water?

957
00:33:38,825 --> 00:33:40,365
- Here you go. - It's here.

958
00:33:41,395 --> 00:33:42,965
Only the meat came.

959
00:33:43,505 --> 00:33:45,305
They'll order another one right away.

960
00:33:46,505 --> 00:33:48,735
It's obvious.

961
00:33:48,875 --> 00:33:50,674
Before he goes away...

962
00:33:50,675 --> 00:33:53,715
- We have to eat it when it's warm. - Thank you.

963
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:55,115
(Disgusted)

964
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:57,114
What about them? Aren't they eating?

965
00:33:57,115 --> 00:33:58,414
They ate.

966
00:33:58,415 --> 00:33:59,415
They already ate.

967
00:33:59,416 --> 00:34:00,785
The boiled meat is...

968
00:34:02,715 --> 00:34:05,454
Korean pork shoulder.

969
00:34:05,455 --> 00:34:06,554
My gosh.

970
00:34:06,555 --> 00:34:08,515
(Korean pork shoulder is cooked for a long time.)

971
00:34:09,295 --> 00:34:11,064
I sliced different cuts.

972
00:34:11,065 --> 00:34:12,465
(When each cut is sliced nicely)

973
00:34:13,495 --> 00:34:15,635
(The perfect balance between fat and meat)

974
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:19,435
(Boiled pork that tastes rough yet intense)

975
00:34:19,705 --> 00:34:21,104
It looks beautiful.

976
00:34:21,105 --> 00:34:22,335
(It looks beautiful.)

977
00:34:22,505 --> 00:34:24,605
Is that doenjang?

978
00:34:24,845 --> 00:34:25,904
- Is it served with the meat? - Real doenjang.

979
00:34:25,905 --> 00:34:27,014
Real doenjang.

980
00:34:27,015 --> 00:34:28,074
(Paired according to your own taste)

981
00:34:28,075 --> 00:34:29,544
It looks very tender.

982
00:34:29,545 --> 00:34:30,685
The meat tastes...

983
00:34:32,955 --> 00:34:35,115
(Savoring)

984
00:34:36,655 --> 00:34:38,825
(This is it.)

985
00:34:40,095 --> 00:34:41,524
It's so tender.

986
00:34:41,525 --> 00:34:42,554
The meat tastes...

987
00:34:42,555 --> 00:34:44,995
(Frowning honestly)

988
00:34:46,435 --> 00:34:49,564
(He can't resist it and eats two pieces at the same time.)

989
00:34:49,565 --> 00:34:51,604
He's wrinkling his forehead now.

990
00:34:51,605 --> 00:34:52,765
It's fresh...

991
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:57,044
- Why don't you... - He's upset again.

992
00:34:57,045 --> 00:34:58,445
(He gets easily upset when eating.)

993
00:34:59,105 --> 00:35:02,244
(The meat goes right into Yi Kyung's mouth.)

994
00:35:02,245 --> 00:35:03,245
(Humming)

995
00:35:03,246 --> 00:35:04,384
The meat tastes...

996
00:35:04,385 --> 00:35:06,255
(In awe)

997
00:35:06,415 --> 00:35:08,014
How is the fat? Is it firm?

998
00:35:08,015 --> 00:35:09,015
(Curious)

999
00:35:09,016 --> 00:35:10,724
- It's... - Is it warm? Tender?

1000
00:35:10,725 --> 00:35:11,785
(Also curious)

1001
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:13,895
It's not just tender and firm.

1002
00:35:15,355 --> 00:35:16,464
It will be gone soon.

1003
00:35:16,465 --> 00:35:18,065
They would eat 2 to 3 plates.

1004
00:35:19,295 --> 00:35:21,695
If you sing one of John Park's songs, I'll give you a piece.

1005
00:35:21,795 --> 00:35:23,405
(When I open my eyes in the morning)

1006
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,605
(Going right in)

1007
00:35:26,065 --> 00:35:27,775
(Sang Uk, you're the best.)

1008
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,604
(Freeloading within the shortest time)

1009
00:35:30,605 --> 00:35:32,205
In the blink of an eye.

1010
00:35:32,845 --> 00:35:34,074
There was a song I really liked.

1011
00:35:34,075 --> 00:35:35,075
(Eating)

1012
00:35:35,076 --> 00:35:36,115
This is amazing.

1013
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:40,355
At naengmyeon restaurants these days,

1014
00:35:40,815 --> 00:35:42,015
when you order boiled pork,

1015
00:35:43,355 --> 00:35:44,784
- it's nicely cut. - Right.

1016
00:35:44,785 --> 00:35:47,755
Yes, but this boiled pork has a rough taste.

1017
00:35:48,895 --> 00:35:51,565
It's also sliced irregularly.

1018
00:35:52,365 --> 00:35:54,665
It's a lot like the boiled pork served in Pil-dong,

1019
00:35:54,695 --> 00:35:56,135
but the pieces are thicker...

1020
00:35:56,465 --> 00:35:57,965
and bouncier.

1021
00:35:58,735 --> 00:36:00,735
He definitely knows a lot about naengmyeon.

1022
00:36:01,905 --> 00:36:02,975
It calls for alcohol.

1023
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,475
Really? Go ahead and have some.

1024
00:36:06,175 --> 00:36:07,914
- You can sleep it off. - I'm good.

1025
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,644
Pour yourself a glass but don't have it all.

1026
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:12,144
I'll be left wanting more if I only have a glass.

1027
00:36:12,145 --> 00:36:14,014
I'd rather not have any in the first place.

1028
00:36:14,015 --> 00:36:16,485
They have makgeolli here.

1029
00:36:16,825 --> 00:36:18,325
It's written on the menu.

1030
00:36:19,755 --> 00:36:21,224
Makgeolli's a great idea.

1031
00:36:21,225 --> 00:36:22,385
Should I have some on my own?

1032
00:36:22,595 --> 00:36:24,095
I'll have some too.

1033
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:26,294
(They continue to tempt him.)

1034
00:36:26,295 --> 00:36:27,534
Aren't you a fan of makgeolli?

1035
00:36:27,535 --> 00:36:29,334
We should have some soju before the naengmyeon is served.

1036
00:36:29,335 --> 00:36:31,864
Does makgeolli pair better with this than soju?

1037
00:36:31,865 --> 00:36:33,875
- I have naengmyeon with soju. - Soju all the way.

1038
00:36:33,905 --> 00:36:36,244
Makgeolli's a good choice if I were only having the meat.

1039
00:36:36,245 --> 00:36:38,904
Naengmyeon and soju. Really?

1040
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:39,974
I hear the naengmyeon broth...

1041
00:36:39,975 --> 00:36:41,414
is perfect to have with soju.

1042
00:36:41,415 --> 00:36:42,644
- Really? - The naengmyeon broth.

1043
00:36:42,645 --> 00:36:44,114
You take scissors...

1044
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:45,744
- You cut the noodles up. - and cut the noodles up.

1045
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,914
Exactly.

1046
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:48,484
I'll never be able...

1047
00:36:48,485 --> 00:36:50,184
to understand heavy drinkers.

1048
00:36:50,185 --> 00:36:51,985
Drink first and follow it up with naengmyeon.

1049
00:36:52,085 --> 00:36:53,924
Can we get a bottle of soju?

1050
00:36:53,925 --> 00:36:54,925
(He gives in to the temptation.)

1051
00:36:54,926 --> 00:36:55,955
A bottle of soju, please.

1052
00:36:56,125 --> 00:36:58,794
(Laughing)

1053
00:36:58,795 --> 00:37:00,895
- My dad's like that too. - I'll have one shot.

1054
00:37:01,495 --> 00:37:02,495
Here you go.

1055
00:37:02,496 --> 00:37:04,104
(The main dish is served.)

1056
00:37:04,105 --> 00:37:05,334
So that's how their naengmyeon is.

1057
00:37:05,335 --> 00:37:07,004
The weather's hot today,

1058
00:37:07,005 --> 00:37:08,474
- The perilla oil smells incredible. - so...

1059
00:37:08,475 --> 00:37:09,504
we added some ice.

1060
00:37:09,505 --> 00:37:10,804
(Mul naengmyeon, Perilla oil bibim naengmyeon)

1061
00:37:10,805 --> 00:37:11,974
Is this perilla oil?

1062
00:37:11,975 --> 00:37:13,444
- That's right. - I love the nutty aroma.

1063
00:37:13,445 --> 00:37:14,644
Perilla oil...

1064
00:37:14,645 --> 00:37:16,614
was drizzled on top of the bibim naengmyeon.

1065
00:37:16,615 --> 00:37:17,845
Are they served together?

1066
00:37:21,615 --> 00:37:25,425
(Freshly made buckwheat noodles)

1067
00:37:26,755 --> 00:37:31,695
(The noodles are stirred in hot water until cooked.)

1068
00:37:33,595 --> 00:37:37,005
(An ice bath makes the noodles bouncier.)

1069
00:37:40,305 --> 00:37:43,705
(Garnish and sauce are stacked on top of the noodles.)

1070
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:47,645
(Next, the slightly frozen broth is poured in.)

1071
00:37:48,075 --> 00:37:49,815
(Subtle but intense, Mul naengmyeon)

1072
00:37:50,515 --> 00:37:53,815
(Perilla oil instead of the broth)

1073
00:37:54,555 --> 00:37:57,325
(Perilla oil bibim naengmyeon)

1074
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,765
Let's cleanse our mouths first.

1075
00:37:59,355 --> 00:38:00,595
- Here. - Cheers.

1076
00:38:01,295 --> 00:38:02,395
I'll enjoy.

1077
00:38:05,195 --> 00:38:06,795
- That's so good. - See?

1078
00:38:09,805 --> 00:38:11,665
That looked sexy just now.

1079
00:38:11,735 --> 00:38:13,035
You can tell...

1080
00:38:13,805 --> 00:38:15,134
that he loves to drink.

1081
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:16,175
(Getting drawn in)

1082
00:38:17,205 --> 00:38:18,375
To this,

1083
00:38:18,705 --> 00:38:19,905
I'll have a piece of the meat.

1084
00:38:21,415 --> 00:38:23,784
- It's so good. - That's why you have it.

1085
00:38:23,785 --> 00:38:24,884
(Yummy)

1086
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:26,284
Just now,

1087
00:38:26,285 --> 00:38:27,754
after drinking soju,

1088
00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:30,154
John had a piece of meat without any dip.

1089
00:38:30,155 --> 00:38:31,324
- Right. - Do they go well together?

1090
00:38:31,325 --> 00:38:32,655
Yes, that was a great combo.

1091
00:38:33,195 --> 00:38:35,025
- I wanted one as is. - Exactly.

1092
00:38:35,925 --> 00:38:38,125
But now I'm thinking I should've taken my time.

1093
00:38:39,695 --> 00:38:41,264
- You can have more. - No way.

1094
00:38:41,265 --> 00:38:42,465
I'm only having just one shot.

1095
00:38:42,765 --> 00:38:44,704
Who are you in a battle with?

1096
00:38:44,705 --> 00:38:46,104
- It's all in his head. - Are you battling yourself?

1097
00:38:46,105 --> 00:38:47,374
- On his own... - No one...

1098
00:38:47,375 --> 00:38:49,405
will tell you off for drinking more.

1099
00:38:49,435 --> 00:38:50,744
- Maybe... - He's battling Andrew.

1100
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,804
Is it your family?

1101
00:38:51,805 --> 00:38:53,144
- Because... - Does your wife tell you off?

1102
00:38:53,145 --> 00:38:54,775
If I have another shot,

1103
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,745
I'll have another...

1104
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:58,144
and then another.

1105
00:38:58,145 --> 00:38:59,284
It's a matter of drawing the line.

1106
00:38:59,285 --> 00:39:01,014
We'll draw the line for you.

1107
00:39:01,015 --> 00:39:02,254
- I'm good. - After three shots.

1108
00:39:02,255 --> 00:39:03,824
After you've had three,

1109
00:39:03,825 --> 00:39:05,025
we'll punch you on the fourth.

1110
00:39:05,085 --> 00:39:06,325
Don't you worry.

1111
00:39:06,355 --> 00:39:07,724
- I'm good. - How can you only have one shot?

1112
00:39:07,725 --> 00:39:08,995
One shot is fine.

1113
00:39:10,395 --> 00:39:11,964
(Finally, they have the main dish, mul naengmyeon.)

1114
00:39:11,965 --> 00:39:13,025
- Nice. - Good.

1115
00:39:13,365 --> 00:39:15,034
Don't mix the sauce yet.

1116
00:39:15,035 --> 00:39:19,205
(He tries the clear broth before mixing the sauce in.)

1117
00:39:20,535 --> 00:39:23,135
The flavors fall somewhere between Hamheung and Pyongyang styles.

1118
00:39:23,875 --> 00:39:25,905
- Really? - If you have the broth alone.

1119
00:39:25,945 --> 00:39:27,074
- I bet that intrigues you. - It does.

1120
00:39:27,075 --> 00:39:28,144
Order one for yourself.

1121
00:39:28,145 --> 00:39:29,444
(You can't have mine.)

1122
00:39:29,445 --> 00:39:30,445
Whatever.

1123
00:39:30,515 --> 00:39:31,745
But you're on the same team.

1124
00:39:31,815 --> 00:39:33,015
But...

1125
00:39:33,285 --> 00:39:34,954
(It's so good, he refuses to share it with his teammate.)

1126
00:39:34,955 --> 00:39:36,884
This got a thumbs-up from the elders.

1127
00:39:36,885 --> 00:39:38,355
This is what they had.

1128
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,154
(Slurping)

1129
00:39:41,155 --> 00:39:43,125
The noodles are slightly thicker.

1130
00:39:43,895 --> 00:39:46,575
Thicker than naengmyeon noodles, but thinner than makguksu noodles.

1131
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:51,085
- That's refreshing. - How is it?

1132
00:39:53,105 --> 00:39:57,345
(Seung Ho also respectfully grabs some of the noodles.)

1133
00:39:57,705 --> 00:40:00,574
(Sucking in the noodles)

1134
00:40:00,575 --> 00:40:02,775
The noodles seem thicker than other naengmyeon noodles.

1135
00:40:03,415 --> 00:40:06,135
Thicker than naengmyeon noodles, but thinner than jjolmyeon noodles.

1136
00:40:06,455 --> 00:40:08,814
The flavors fall somewhere between Hamheung and Pyongyang styles.

1137
00:40:08,815 --> 00:40:10,024
I agree.

1138
00:40:10,025 --> 00:40:12,385
There's no other way to say it.

1139
00:40:12,855 --> 00:40:14,255
It falls right in the middle.

1140
00:40:14,795 --> 00:40:16,094
The flavor of the broth is subtle,

1141
00:40:16,095 --> 00:40:17,424
but the sauce makes up for it.

1142
00:40:17,425 --> 00:40:19,835
The noodles aren't thick,

1143
00:40:20,435 --> 00:40:23,065
you get a taste of both Hamheung and Pyongyang-style naengmyeon.

1144
00:40:23,165 --> 00:40:24,905
Anyone would easily enjoy this.

1145
00:40:25,235 --> 00:40:27,195
Still, it's closer to Pyongyang-style naengmyeon.

1146
00:40:27,275 --> 00:40:28,934
Enjoy it as much as you want.

1147
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:30,605
- Can I? - There's more you can have.

1148
00:40:31,845 --> 00:40:32,904
There you go.

1149
00:40:32,905 --> 00:40:34,574
(He grabs some of the mul naengmyeon.)

1150
00:40:34,575 --> 00:40:36,175
- Are you sulking? - I'll have it as is.

1151
00:40:38,915 --> 00:40:43,755
(An elegant bite)

1152
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:47,324
(Nodding)

1153
00:40:47,325 --> 00:40:49,895
(He nods again.)

1154
00:40:50,125 --> 00:40:51,625
John looks like...

1155
00:40:52,125 --> 00:40:53,835
he's hosting an eating show.

1156
00:40:54,435 --> 00:40:56,034
Yes, but an eating show...

1157
00:40:56,035 --> 00:40:58,364
that is quiet and classy.

1158
00:40:58,365 --> 00:41:00,934
He savors the flavors and takes it seriously.

1159
00:41:00,935 --> 00:41:03,095
(Solitary Naengmyeon Park hosts a classy eating show.)

1160
00:41:03,545 --> 00:41:04,644
How is it?

1161
00:41:04,645 --> 00:41:06,405
He's taking some time to think.

1162
00:41:06,745 --> 00:41:08,545
- How is it? - I totally get...

1163
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,144
what they were saying.

1164
00:41:10,145 --> 00:41:11,444
I don't usually drink...

1165
00:41:11,445 --> 00:41:14,914
the broth that is served with Hamheung naengmyeon.

1166
00:41:14,915 --> 00:41:17,224
It's too sour and sweet for me.

1167
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,284
- You're right. - But this?

1168
00:41:19,285 --> 00:41:21,995
The flavors of this broth aren't too strong.

1169
00:41:22,295 --> 00:41:25,565
I can definitely see myself drinking all of the broth.

1170
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:26,765
I'd...

1171
00:41:27,435 --> 00:41:29,065
come by to have this again.

1172
00:41:29,335 --> 00:41:30,934
This dish is charming enough...

1173
00:41:30,935 --> 00:41:32,635
to make me want to do that.

1174
00:41:34,135 --> 00:41:36,404
("Flavors I'd come back for...")

1175
00:41:36,405 --> 00:41:38,405
(by Pyongyang naengmyeon expert Naengmyeon Park)

1176
00:41:38,475 --> 00:41:41,014
I bet the perilla oil naengmyeon will really be good.

1177
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:42,345
- I can still smell it. - I know.

1178
00:41:42,845 --> 00:41:43,944
Those who don't like it...

1179
00:41:43,945 --> 00:41:45,044
- don't eat it at all. - Exactly.

1180
00:41:45,045 --> 00:41:47,414
(He grabs a big amount of the perilla oil bibim naengmyeon.)

1181
00:41:47,415 --> 00:41:50,054
(A mouthful)

1182
00:41:50,055 --> 00:41:51,895
- I bet the noodles are bouncy. - The noodles?

1183
00:41:52,125 --> 00:41:53,594
You can easily cut them with your teeth.

1184
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:55,154
You don't use scissors with the Pyongyang-style.

1185
00:41:55,155 --> 00:41:59,265
(The solitary eating show is back on.)

1186
00:42:00,365 --> 00:42:01,465
It's so good.

1187
00:42:01,935 --> 00:42:03,504
It's been confirmed by Naengmyeon Park.

1188
00:42:03,505 --> 00:42:05,305
That means it's the real deal.

1189
00:42:05,405 --> 00:42:06,874
Perilla oil makguksu and perilla oil naengmyeon...

1190
00:42:06,875 --> 00:42:08,374
- have been the craze these days. - Right.

1191
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:09,974
Those dishes...

1192
00:42:09,975 --> 00:42:11,074
usually add sesame seeds,

1193
00:42:11,075 --> 00:42:12,144
- crushed dried laver, - Exactly.

1194
00:42:12,145 --> 00:42:13,674
And sugar.

1195
00:42:13,675 --> 00:42:14,874
Sometimes, it's seasoned with soy sauce.

1196
00:42:14,875 --> 00:42:17,014
After a few bites,

1197
00:42:17,015 --> 00:42:19,214
- you feel like you've had enough. - You don't want more.

1198
00:42:19,215 --> 00:42:22,284
This bibim naengmyeon...

1199
00:42:22,285 --> 00:42:24,525
has the perfect balance of spice and sweetness.

1200
00:42:24,825 --> 00:42:26,855
The perilla oil wraps it up...

1201
00:42:28,025 --> 00:42:30,224
like a blanket, giving it a nutty taste.

1202
00:42:30,225 --> 00:42:31,764
- You don't get sick of it... - I see.

1203
00:42:31,765 --> 00:42:33,365
Thanks to the sauce.

1204
00:42:33,735 --> 00:42:36,734
I find myself drawn to how he explains...

1205
00:42:36,735 --> 00:42:37,964
- the food. - Tell me about it.

1206
00:42:37,965 --> 00:42:39,834
- He sounds like an expert. - He seems like someone...

1207
00:42:39,835 --> 00:42:42,234
- who hosts an eating show. - I'm not kidding.

1208
00:42:42,235 --> 00:42:44,804
He explains it so well...

1209
00:42:44,805 --> 00:42:46,405
that I feel like I've tasted it.

1210
00:42:46,945 --> 00:42:48,944
Don't you feel like the dish will be exactly how he described it?

1211
00:42:48,945 --> 00:42:51,515
- Yes, I can picture it. - It'll be how he described it.

1212
00:42:52,045 --> 00:42:53,684
The way he looks at it tells me I can trust him.

1213
00:42:53,685 --> 00:42:54,955
You sound like an expert.

1214
00:42:55,915 --> 00:43:01,655
(Seung Ho's intrigued, and it's making him frustrated.)

1215
00:43:02,625 --> 00:43:03,725
This is really good.

1216
00:43:03,995 --> 00:43:05,094
Here goes Seung Ho.

1217
00:43:05,095 --> 00:43:06,224
He's using his technique.

1218
00:43:06,225 --> 00:43:07,435
(And thus...)

1219
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,434
- No way. - I was going to have it in secret.

1220
00:43:09,435 --> 00:43:10,534
What's that?

1221
00:43:10,535 --> 00:43:11,604
(Perilla oil bibim naengmyeon as a corn dog)

1222
00:43:11,605 --> 00:43:12,665
It's a corn dog.

1223
00:43:13,035 --> 00:43:14,604
That's how you enjoy a dish.

1224
00:43:14,605 --> 00:43:15,875
That's what John said.

1225
00:43:19,875 --> 00:43:21,015
How is it?

1226
00:43:21,545 --> 00:43:24,644
(It's as good as John said.)

1227
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:26,685
The flavors are subtle and delicious.

1228
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:28,215
I could keep eating this.

1229
00:43:28,455 --> 00:43:30,584
The perilla oil smells incredible...

1230
00:43:30,585 --> 00:43:32,354
and it's not overwhelming.

1231
00:43:32,355 --> 00:43:34,695
The flavors create such a nice balance.

1232
00:43:34,755 --> 00:43:37,564
I get why 9 out of 10 people order the bibim naengmyeon.

1233
00:43:37,565 --> 00:43:39,024
(The reason why 9 out of 10 people order the bibim naengmyeon!)

1234
00:43:39,025 --> 00:43:40,434
- Really? - It's so good.

1235
00:43:40,435 --> 00:43:41,494
This is amazing.

1236
00:43:41,495 --> 00:43:42,835
This combo is killer.

1237
00:43:43,505 --> 00:43:44,934
It's so good.

1238
00:43:44,935 --> 00:43:46,004
(Enjoy buckwheat noodles...)

1239
00:43:46,005 --> 00:43:47,411
(depending on your preference and mood.)

1240
00:43:47,435 --> 00:43:48,834
Let's have the bill, then.

1241
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,545
- Earlier... - The bill?

1242
00:43:51,105 --> 00:43:52,105
- Thank you. - What?

1243
00:43:52,106 --> 00:43:53,274
See? It's only 70 dollars.

1244
00:43:53,275 --> 00:43:55,075
- That'll be 76 dollars. - That sounds right.

1245
00:43:55,515 --> 00:43:57,185
- Is it 76 dollars? - That's right.

1246
00:43:57,245 --> 00:43:59,085
It's time for your quiz.

1247
00:43:59,285 --> 00:44:00,315
Yes, sir.

1248
00:44:00,815 --> 00:44:03,014
- In "Essays by Yi Yu Won," - This is a tough one,

1249
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:06,425
a book published in late Joseon...

1250
00:44:06,525 --> 00:44:07,895
This has to do with naengmyeon.

1251
00:44:08,225 --> 00:44:10,364
While enjoying the moonlit sky,

1252
00:44:10,365 --> 00:44:12,764
King Sunjo ordered naengmyeon...

1253
00:44:12,765 --> 00:44:14,935
to be brought to him and his servants.

1254
00:44:14,965 --> 00:44:17,934
However, because of the selfish act of the servant...

1255
00:44:17,935 --> 00:44:19,905
sent to buy naengmyeon,

1256
00:44:19,965 --> 00:44:21,734
King Sunjo was upset...

1257
00:44:21,735 --> 00:44:24,775
and did not allow him to eat any that day.

1258
00:44:24,905 --> 00:44:26,545
What did this servant do?

1259
00:44:26,975 --> 00:44:28,575
- You'll know. - Did he eat alone?

1260
00:44:28,645 --> 00:44:30,114
Dong Hyun would know.

1261
00:44:30,115 --> 00:44:31,585
Of course, I know.

1262
00:44:31,915 --> 00:44:33,655
- I know. - Because he's selfish?

1263
00:44:34,315 --> 00:44:36,055
I think it's because he ordered a double.

1264
00:44:36,925 --> 00:44:37,984
Just his?

1265
00:44:37,985 --> 00:44:40,455
He probably served more for himself.

1266
00:44:40,525 --> 00:44:41,554
Either he scooped up more...

1267
00:44:41,555 --> 00:44:42,994
or bought more to begin with.

1268
00:44:42,995 --> 00:44:44,794
He chose the fuller bowl...

1269
00:44:44,795 --> 00:44:46,324
for himself.

1270
00:44:46,325 --> 00:44:47,364
Really?

1271
00:44:47,365 --> 00:44:48,794
How could he have known that would be his?

1272
00:44:48,795 --> 00:44:49,834
I doubt he put his name on it.

1273
00:44:49,835 --> 00:44:51,134
So he kept looking at it like this.

1274
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:52,265
What?

1275
00:44:52,465 --> 00:44:53,534
In front of the king?

1276
00:44:53,535 --> 00:44:55,805
You could pay with your life for doing that.

1277
00:44:56,535 --> 00:44:59,375
Or maybe he had a bowl before coming back.

1278
00:45:00,145 --> 00:45:01,514
That makes sense.

1279
00:45:01,515 --> 00:45:02,574
He was sent to buy naengmyeon,

1280
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:04,685
but he had a bowl before returning.

1281
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:05,884
Even if he did eat it,

1282
00:45:05,885 --> 00:45:07,985
- how would anyone find out? - There's a way.

1283
00:45:08,015 --> 00:45:09,784
There could've been a chili flake stuck in his teeth.

1284
00:45:09,785 --> 00:45:10,824
Maybe it's...

1285
00:45:10,825 --> 00:45:12,455
While answering the king, he could've...

1286
00:45:12,655 --> 00:45:14,694
Just like that, he showed what was stuck there.

1287
00:45:14,695 --> 00:45:15,755
(What on earth is that?)

1288
00:45:16,125 --> 00:45:18,125
Come on. Who answers like that?

1289
00:45:19,065 --> 00:45:20,864
(It sure is original.)

1290
00:45:20,865 --> 00:45:22,694
- That revealed the chili flake. - That?

1291
00:45:22,695 --> 00:45:24,534
He'd get offed for being annoying.

1292
00:45:24,535 --> 00:45:26,364
- I keep checking my teeth. - Is he teasing the king?

1293
00:45:26,365 --> 00:45:28,304
The king would've scolded him.

1294
00:45:28,305 --> 00:45:30,775
- Unbelievable. - It was for King Sunjo.

1295
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,605
I don't think he ate some first.

1296
00:45:33,005 --> 00:45:34,414
Because if he had already eaten some,

1297
00:45:34,415 --> 00:45:35,914
not being allowed to eat...

1298
00:45:35,915 --> 00:45:37,514
wouldn't be much of a punishment.

1299
00:45:37,515 --> 00:45:39,315
He had some already, remember?

1300
00:45:40,015 --> 00:45:41,184
He ate some...

1301
00:45:41,185 --> 00:45:42,754
on his way back.

1302
00:45:42,755 --> 00:45:43,784
He had some of it.

1303
00:45:43,785 --> 00:45:45,784
Whether it was the garnish, the noodles,

1304
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:47,254
or the broth,

1305
00:45:47,255 --> 00:45:48,554
something was missing...

1306
00:45:48,555 --> 00:45:50,195
from the naengmyeon dish.

1307
00:45:50,295 --> 00:45:52,325
He's talking in a comprehensive way.

1308
00:45:53,635 --> 00:45:55,464
He said a comprehensive answer, and it's correct.

1309
00:45:55,465 --> 00:45:57,004
- Is it? - Yes. It's a comprehensive version.

1310
00:45:57,005 --> 00:45:58,205
It's what we said.

1311
00:45:58,505 --> 00:45:59,834
The selfish act was...

1312
00:45:59,835 --> 00:46:00,935
(So the answer is...)

1313
00:46:01,605 --> 00:46:05,145
he tasted it before he finished the errand.

1314
00:46:05,645 --> 00:46:06,674
Okay.

1315
00:46:06,675 --> 00:46:08,214
(Is it correct?)

1316
00:46:08,215 --> 00:46:11,114
He tasted it before he finished the errand.

1317
00:46:11,115 --> 00:46:12,315
Did he order a double?

1318
00:46:13,655 --> 00:46:15,936
- I can't think of anything else. - Get the answer, then.

1319
00:46:16,155 --> 00:46:17,155
Incorrect.

1320
00:46:17,385 --> 00:46:18,385
See?

1321
00:46:18,386 --> 00:46:19,524
Is it an individual game now? I got it.

1322
00:46:19,525 --> 00:46:21,024
(It has turned into an individual game right away.)

1323
00:46:21,025 --> 00:46:22,395
- Okay. - He ordered a double.

1324
00:46:22,725 --> 00:46:23,765
A double.

1325
00:46:24,295 --> 00:46:25,324
Incorrect.

1326
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:27,194
He ordered more and stashed it.

1327
00:46:27,195 --> 00:46:28,564
(He stashed a larger amount for himself.)

1328
00:46:28,565 --> 00:46:29,964
He ordered more naengmyeon...

1329
00:46:29,965 --> 00:46:32,035
- and stashed it for himself. - He hid it.

1330
00:46:33,505 --> 00:46:35,434
- Incorrect. - I think I gave away a hit again.

1331
00:46:35,435 --> 00:46:37,805
If he did that, he'd get exiled.

1332
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:39,745
- It means he stole it. - Seriously.

1333
00:46:40,875 --> 00:46:41,975
- I got it. - Okay.

1334
00:46:42,845 --> 00:46:44,715
He set aside some meat garnish for himself.

1335
00:46:46,515 --> 00:46:47,615
We'll consider it correct.

1336
00:46:49,355 --> 00:46:51,124
- What? Why? - Here's the exact answer.

1337
00:46:51,125 --> 00:46:54,154
The servant who got the order bought some pork.

1338
00:46:54,155 --> 00:46:55,824
King Sunjo asked him why he bought it.

1339
00:46:55,825 --> 00:46:58,324
He answered, "I bought it to put it in naengmyeon."

1340
00:46:58,325 --> 00:47:00,364
King Sunjo didn't say anything after hearing the response.

1341
00:47:00,365 --> 00:47:03,565
He didn't give naengmyeon to him when distributing them.

1342
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,064
That's right.

1343
00:47:05,065 --> 00:47:07,834
If Seung Ho were that servant...

1344
00:47:07,835 --> 00:47:08,905
King Sunjo, time-out.

1345
00:47:09,705 --> 00:47:11,744
Come on. I bought it to share with everyone.

1346
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:14,344
I wouldn't buy it just for myself, would I, Your Majesty?

1347
00:47:14,345 --> 00:47:15,374
(Shameless)

1348
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:16,744
- You would do that. - You have to.

1349
00:47:16,745 --> 00:47:18,245
The servant was slow-witted.

1350
00:47:19,015 --> 00:47:21,484
(John is exempt from paying.)

1351
00:47:21,485 --> 00:47:23,624
That means our two aces are against each other.

1352
00:47:23,625 --> 00:47:25,685
I'll end up paying at this pace.

1353
00:47:25,825 --> 00:47:28,295
I'll pay today. It feels like I'll pay.

1354
00:47:28,425 --> 00:47:30,924
Here is the question. In the court during the Joseon Dynasty,

1355
00:47:30,925 --> 00:47:34,094
they enjoyed goldongmyeon, which is a buckwheat noodle dish.

1356
00:47:34,095 --> 00:47:35,835
- "Goldongmyeon?" - Yes. Goldongmyeon.

1357
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,434
"Goldong" means...

1358
00:47:37,435 --> 00:47:39,504
a mixture...

1359
00:47:39,505 --> 00:47:41,774
of various miscellaneous things.

1360
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:45,745
There was also "hondonban," which meant the similar thing.

1361
00:47:45,775 --> 00:47:46,944
"Hondonban."

1362
00:47:46,945 --> 00:47:50,285
What would be hondonban equal to in today's cuisine?

1363
00:47:50,445 --> 00:47:51,484
- Hondonban? - Okay.

1364
00:47:51,485 --> 00:47:52,545
Hondonban?

1365
00:47:53,115 --> 00:47:55,284
- I got it. Bibimbap. - Bibimbap.

1366
00:47:55,285 --> 00:47:58,024
- That's correct. - Ban is rice.

1367
00:47:58,025 --> 00:47:59,684
(Bibimbap?)

1368
00:47:59,685 --> 00:48:00,725
Correct.

1369
00:48:02,025 --> 00:48:03,424
I thought of bibimbap right away too.

1370
00:48:03,425 --> 00:48:04,564
That was the only answer I could think of.

1371
00:48:04,565 --> 00:48:06,224
It was a battle of speed.

1372
00:48:06,225 --> 00:48:07,894
- I'm sorry about it. - Don't be.

1373
00:48:07,895 --> 00:48:09,164
Let's go after paying quickly.

1374
00:48:09,165 --> 00:48:10,165
(Resigned)

1375
00:48:10,166 --> 00:48:12,964
(Seung Ho pays for the LMR 2.)

1376
00:48:12,965 --> 00:48:14,875
- That was cheap, though. - That was good.

1377
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:18,304
- Okay. - Thank you. We enjoyed it so much.

1378
00:48:18,305 --> 00:48:20,315
- Thank you. - We were shocked. It was that good.

1379
00:48:20,545 --> 00:48:21,545
Thank you.

1380
00:48:23,515 --> 00:48:27,415
(As the early summer arrives, the day has gotten longer.)

1381
00:48:28,015 --> 00:48:30,084
(They get out of the crowded market.)

1382
00:48:30,085 --> 00:48:34,694
What are we having for dinner, then?

1383
00:48:34,695 --> 00:48:36,355
What are we eating today?

1384
00:48:37,095 --> 00:48:39,565
Did you decide not to wear makeup, Dong Hyun?

1385
00:48:39,695 --> 00:48:41,194
- I watched our show. - Okay.

1386
00:48:41,195 --> 00:48:43,275
- Was it meaningless? - I didn't see any difference.

1387
00:48:44,105 --> 00:48:45,405
You have clear skin.

1388
00:48:45,665 --> 00:48:47,804
Yes. It's because he sweats a lot.

1389
00:48:47,805 --> 00:48:49,405
Should I wear funny makeup instead?

1390
00:48:49,735 --> 00:48:50,844
Yes.

1391
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:53,604
The one who paid the most will draw on his face.

1392
00:48:53,605 --> 00:48:55,175
Should we do something like that?

1393
00:48:55,345 --> 00:48:56,474
Right. That's...

1394
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:59,184
- The last week's highest payer. - The highest payer.

1395
00:48:59,185 --> 00:49:01,384
Should we draw on the face as a penalty?

1396
00:49:01,385 --> 00:49:03,454
That will make us try harder.

1397
00:49:03,455 --> 00:49:04,524
(If there's a penalty)

1398
00:49:04,525 --> 00:49:05,554
I think it's a good idea.

1399
00:49:05,555 --> 00:49:06,555
(Makeup penalty)

1400
00:49:06,556 --> 00:49:08,625
Sang Uk can wear the fencing uniform.

1401
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,895
- Keep talking. - I can do anything.

1402
00:49:11,325 --> 00:49:13,265
- I mean... - Let's do this. For Dong Hyun,

1403
00:49:13,735 --> 00:49:15,495
he'll show up as he dresses in the Octagon.

1404
00:49:16,635 --> 00:49:18,104
- Yes. - That's better.

1405
00:49:18,105 --> 00:49:19,235
How sexy is it?

1406
00:49:19,735 --> 00:49:21,574
That's your uniform.

1407
00:49:21,575 --> 00:49:24,444
Do you hate what you wear?

1408
00:49:24,445 --> 00:49:26,974
Imagine that I'm wearing that right now.

1409
00:49:26,975 --> 00:49:28,444
(The viewers might hate it.)

1410
00:49:28,445 --> 00:49:29,575
Seriously. It's...

1411
00:49:30,245 --> 00:49:32,415
He'd be doing the show while wearing just his panties.

1412
00:49:33,385 --> 00:49:36,254
- That's embarrassing. - In that case...

1413
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,224
- Dong Hyun, if I wear my uniform, - Why did we bring it up?

1414
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,555
You have to wear the boxers next.

1415
00:49:42,095 --> 00:49:43,095
Are you okay with that?

1416
00:49:43,455 --> 00:49:44,664
- Yes. - That's right.

1417
00:49:44,665 --> 00:49:45,925
If we're on the career theme.

1418
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:48,095
- That won't work. - You can't even wear shoes.

1419
00:49:49,065 --> 00:49:51,034
- He should wear shoes. - Come on. The shoes...

1420
00:49:51,035 --> 00:49:53,004
- And put on the mouth guard. - No.

1421
00:49:53,005 --> 00:49:54,774
I can't. I have to eat.

1422
00:49:54,775 --> 00:49:57,305
It'd be fun if he wears shoes while wearing just the boxers.

1423
00:49:58,305 --> 00:50:00,514
I don't know, but it'd look sexy.

1424
00:50:00,515 --> 00:50:02,944
You might not know, but when the fighters enter,

1425
00:50:02,945 --> 00:50:05,085
they wear the shirts and the shoes.

1426
00:50:05,215 --> 00:50:07,485
You can wear them. We'll take them off for you.

1427
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:11,284
We'll put on the Vaseline.

1428
00:50:11,285 --> 00:50:12,285
Right. I put it on.

1429
00:50:15,525 --> 00:50:17,494
- Seriously. No. - I don't know.

1430
00:50:17,495 --> 00:50:18,894
- Next week. - I'll bring it.

1431
00:50:18,895 --> 00:50:20,835
We'll do the penalty starting from next week.

1432
00:50:20,935 --> 00:50:22,695
Right. As for today's dinner,

1433
00:50:22,835 --> 00:50:26,265
I'm not familiar with either dish.

1434
00:50:26,735 --> 00:50:28,535
- What are they? - Unfamiliar dishes?

1435
00:50:28,875 --> 00:50:32,244
First, it's something you all know. It's the braised monkfish.

1436
00:50:32,245 --> 00:50:36,114
(DMR 1: Braised monkfish)

1437
00:50:36,115 --> 00:50:37,715
The second dish is even more unfamiliar.

1438
00:50:38,515 --> 00:50:39,585
It's grilled bones.

1439
00:50:39,785 --> 00:50:41,055
I see. Grilled bones.

1440
00:50:42,785 --> 00:50:44,255
Is there such a thing?

1441
00:50:44,455 --> 00:50:46,155
The one I had was cooked pork spines...

1442
00:50:46,485 --> 00:50:49,294
covered in the sauce...

1443
00:50:49,295 --> 00:50:52,095
that was similar to the sauce of the spicy fried chicken.

1444
00:50:52,465 --> 00:50:56,165
Both braised monkfish and grilled bones are famous here.

1445
00:50:56,235 --> 00:50:59,405
They are hidden gold gems of the dinner dishes.

1446
00:50:59,965 --> 00:51:02,405
Grilled bones. It sounds good.

1447
00:51:02,505 --> 00:51:05,244
- Tasty braised monkfish's sauce... - Right.

1448
00:51:05,245 --> 00:51:06,565
The bean sprouts are crunchy too.

1449
00:51:06,845 --> 00:51:09,215
(DMR that puts the members into deep thoughts)

1450
00:51:09,675 --> 00:51:13,115
(Braised monkfish versus grilled bones)

1451
00:51:13,185 --> 00:51:15,114
Gosh. I seriously can't decide.

1452
00:51:15,115 --> 00:51:17,284
- I'll choose the grilled bones. - The grilled bones.

1453
00:51:17,285 --> 00:51:19,325
- It's because... - It's new.

1454
00:51:19,385 --> 00:51:21,494
When I heard braised monkfish,

1455
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,594
I can tell how it'd look.

1456
00:51:23,595 --> 00:51:25,525
But since I've never had the grilled bones...

1457
00:51:26,065 --> 00:51:27,065
I'll choose the grilled bones too.

1458
00:51:27,066 --> 00:51:28,895
- I'll get the grilled bones. - Why?

1459
00:51:29,465 --> 00:51:33,165
If it's the one I had before, it's really good.

1460
00:51:33,435 --> 00:51:35,074
- What if it isn't? - It's so... What?

1461
00:51:35,075 --> 00:51:36,075
(Flustered)

1462
00:51:36,076 --> 00:51:38,945
If not, it'd be my first time trying it.

1463
00:51:39,105 --> 00:51:40,444
It'd be my first experience.

1464
00:51:40,445 --> 00:51:41,714
(Thinking)

1465
00:51:41,715 --> 00:51:43,035
I'll choose the braised monkfish.

1466
00:51:43,145 --> 00:51:44,344
You're going for the basics.

1467
00:51:44,345 --> 00:51:45,645
I'll have what I'm used to.

1468
00:51:46,585 --> 00:51:48,431
Can you say it more enthusiastically, Tae Hyun?

1469
00:51:48,455 --> 00:51:50,054
(Laughing)

1470
00:51:50,055 --> 00:51:51,754
You said it so blandly.

1471
00:51:51,755 --> 00:51:52,755
(Embarrassed)

1472
00:51:52,756 --> 00:51:56,055
- I like braised monkfish. - Right.

1473
00:51:56,725 --> 00:51:58,124
That was better.

1474
00:51:58,125 --> 00:51:59,224
(He successfully said it with enthusiasm.)

1475
00:51:59,225 --> 00:52:00,394
I'll choose the grilled bones.

1476
00:52:00,395 --> 00:52:01,395
(Seung Ho chose the grilled bones after thinking for a long time.)

1477
00:52:01,396 --> 00:52:03,564
- Meat it is. - I'll have the monkfish with soju.

1478
00:52:03,565 --> 00:52:04,565
(John chose the braised monkfish too!)

1479
00:52:04,566 --> 00:52:06,864
- What? - I want to join you suddenly.

1480
00:52:06,865 --> 00:52:08,881
- I want to drink soju with you. - It will be so good.

1481
00:52:08,905 --> 00:52:11,044
Then I'll choose the braised monkfish.

1482
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:12,285
- The braised monkfish. - Good.

1483
00:52:12,375 --> 00:52:14,114
Since we made our decision, I'll tell you something.

1484
00:52:14,115 --> 00:52:15,345
I heard it somewhere.

1485
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:17,444
I think I heard it from the audio director...

1486
00:52:17,445 --> 00:52:19,184
about the grilled bones place.

1487
00:52:19,185 --> 00:52:21,284
He waited to get in but failed twice.

1488
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:22,355
What?

1489
00:52:22,855 --> 00:52:24,484
- What? - Now I'm curious.

1490
00:52:24,485 --> 00:52:25,654
- Hold on. - It's over.

1491
00:52:25,655 --> 00:52:27,555
You can eat the braised monkfish alone, right?

1492
00:52:29,025 --> 00:52:32,364
There was a master of the braised monkfish.

1493
00:52:32,365 --> 00:52:34,494
He passed his recipe to 6 people He's 1 of them.

1494
00:52:34,495 --> 00:52:36,394
- What? Hold on. - Sounds good.

1495
00:52:36,395 --> 00:52:38,204
- Good. - Wait. The braised monkfish.

1496
00:52:38,205 --> 00:52:39,704
- You chose it. - Yes.

1497
00:52:39,705 --> 00:52:40,804
- So? - Isn't it a good thing?

1498
00:52:40,805 --> 00:52:42,935
- It's great. I was thrilled. - Really?

1499
00:52:44,675 --> 00:52:47,415
Why were you upset about it, then?

1500
00:52:47,515 --> 00:52:49,814
You forgot that you chose the braised monkfish, didn't you?

1501
00:52:49,815 --> 00:52:51,045
No.

1502
00:52:51,485 --> 00:52:52,544
That's a reasonable doubt.

1503
00:52:52,545 --> 00:52:53,684
Did I choose the braised monkfish?

1504
00:52:53,685 --> 00:52:56,785
Between the braised monkfish and grilled bones,

1505
00:52:57,225 --> 00:52:58,454
the grilled bones place is right next to us.

1506
00:52:58,455 --> 00:52:59,855
(It's the first place to go!)

1507
00:53:00,055 --> 00:53:01,695
- Good. - We'll have grilled bones first.

1508
00:53:02,225 --> 00:53:03,694
Let's have grilled bones in Gyeongdong Market.

1509
00:53:03,695 --> 00:53:04,924
(Going straight to the grilled bones restaurant)

1510
00:53:04,925 --> 00:53:06,265
We'll have a penalty from now on.

1511
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:07,765
Okay.

1512
00:53:09,735 --> 00:53:11,765
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1513
00:53:12,335 --> 00:53:13,335
Bye.

1514
00:53:13,336 --> 00:53:15,035
(On the move to have the first DMR)

1515
00:53:15,635 --> 00:53:16,934
What? It's right here.

1516
00:53:16,935 --> 00:53:19,144
Gosh. It's not near. It's next door.

1517
00:53:19,145 --> 00:53:21,314
- What? It's a jokbal place. - It's next door.

1518
00:53:21,315 --> 00:53:22,915
(The restaurant is 3 seconds away.)

1519
00:53:23,945 --> 00:53:25,015
What?

1520
00:53:25,645 --> 00:53:26,784
We came out, and it's here.

1521
00:53:26,785 --> 00:53:27,814
It's next door.

1522
00:53:27,815 --> 00:53:29,631
(Will they even be able to digest their lunch?)

1523
00:53:29,655 --> 00:53:31,025
Hey, so many people are in there.

1524
00:53:31,855 --> 00:53:33,285
Is it packed already?

1525
00:53:33,485 --> 00:53:35,005
Gosh. So many people are here already.

1526
00:53:37,395 --> 00:53:38,565
- Goodness. - Hello.

1527
00:53:39,025 --> 00:53:41,185
- Gosh. It's packed. - Look how many people there are.

1528
00:53:42,865 --> 00:53:45,304
It's already packed when it's still early.

1529
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,875
(It's a famous restaurant that's packed early in the evening.)

1530
00:53:48,435 --> 00:53:50,504
(If you want to get in, )

1531
00:53:50,505 --> 00:53:52,505
(write your name down.)

1532
00:53:57,885 --> 00:54:01,485
You always have to wait 1 to 2 hours in order to get in.

1533
00:54:01,715 --> 00:54:04,025
I forgot about the wait because it was that good.

1534
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:06,895
I've been coming here since the freshman year.

1535
00:54:07,125 --> 00:54:09,124
I've graduated already.

1536
00:54:09,125 --> 00:54:11,595
I came to have it after a while.

1537
00:54:12,295 --> 00:54:15,334
I hate waiting so much.

1538
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:17,635
But this place is worth the wait.

1539
00:54:17,865 --> 00:54:19,635
I highly recommend it.

1540
00:54:20,405 --> 00:54:21,934
(Super tender meat...)

1541
00:54:21,935 --> 00:54:24,305
(hiding in the red sauce)

1542
00:54:25,675 --> 00:54:28,575
(DMR 1: Grilled bones)

1543
00:54:30,045 --> 00:54:33,444
- Hello. Come here. - Hello. Nice to meet you.

1544
00:54:33,445 --> 00:54:34,584
Nice to see you.

1545
00:54:34,585 --> 00:54:35,585
(Owner: Hwang Jeong Soon)

1546
00:54:35,586 --> 00:54:38,554
We're not used to the grilled bones.

1547
00:54:38,555 --> 00:54:40,854
What exactly are those and how did you start making it?

1548
00:54:40,855 --> 00:54:43,124
- What kind of bones are they? - What are the bones?

1549
00:54:43,125 --> 00:54:44,564
They are pork spine and neck.

1550
00:54:44,565 --> 00:54:47,434
- They're the ones in gamjatang. - The pork spines?

1551
00:54:47,435 --> 00:54:49,034
- The pork spines. - I see.

1552
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:51,135
- Do you boil it first? - Of course.

1553
00:54:52,165 --> 00:54:55,275
I drain the blood out and boil them.

1554
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:57,304
- I grilled them over charcoal. - Charcoal.

1555
00:54:57,305 --> 00:55:00,504
You grill the bones on charcoal and put the sauce.

1556
00:55:00,505 --> 00:55:02,175
Yes. I boil them down in the sauce.

1557
00:55:02,975 --> 00:55:05,584
How come there are so many customers?

1558
00:55:05,585 --> 00:55:09,514
A female college student came to have the grilled bones.

1559
00:55:09,515 --> 00:55:12,184
She had it and liked it.

1560
00:55:12,185 --> 00:55:14,494
She wrote about it and posted it on the social media.

1561
00:55:14,495 --> 00:55:16,171
- That's how... - A female college student?

1562
00:55:16,195 --> 00:55:18,094
No wonder there are many youngsters.

1563
00:55:18,095 --> 00:55:20,734
A college student, who came as a customer,

1564
00:55:20,735 --> 00:55:22,494
posted that it was good,

1565
00:55:22,495 --> 00:55:24,264
- and it went viral. - Yes.

1566
00:55:24,265 --> 00:55:25,265
(It went viral among the young on social media.)

1567
00:55:25,266 --> 00:55:26,804
Which college did she go to?

1568
00:55:26,805 --> 00:55:28,705
- The UOS. - The University of Seoul.

1569
00:55:28,905 --> 00:55:31,844
Do you still get to communicate...

1570
00:55:31,845 --> 00:55:34,344
with that university student?

1571
00:55:34,345 --> 00:55:37,585
I heard she went to the S Company.

1572
00:55:38,045 --> 00:55:39,445
She comes from time to time.

1573
00:55:39,885 --> 00:55:41,684
She went to the S Company after eating this.

1574
00:55:41,685 --> 00:55:42,765
- That's right. - Goodness.

1575
00:55:43,155 --> 00:55:44,184
She went in because of this.

1576
00:55:44,185 --> 00:55:45,185
(It's a good restaurant that gets you hired.)

1577
00:55:45,186 --> 00:55:46,854
Is the medium spicy spicy?

1578
00:55:46,855 --> 00:55:49,994
The medium spicy is a bit spicier than the S Ramyeon.

1579
00:55:49,995 --> 00:55:51,294
- Is it spicier? - Yes.

1580
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,295
- Than S Ramyeon? - Yes.

1581
00:55:52,296 --> 00:55:54,865
But I recommend the medium-spicy.

1582
00:55:55,335 --> 00:55:57,564
- Can you eat that? - It's too spicy.

1583
00:55:57,565 --> 00:55:59,735
(The one who can't eat spicy food is worried.)

1584
00:55:59,865 --> 00:56:01,604
There is a reason...

1585
00:56:01,605 --> 00:56:03,334
- why she recommends it. - It's...

1586
00:56:03,335 --> 00:56:04,504
In that case...

1587
00:56:04,505 --> 00:56:05,545
(I'm confident.)

1588
00:56:05,645 --> 00:56:07,375
We'll order four medium-spicy and...

1589
00:56:07,715 --> 00:56:09,115
Two flying fish roe riceballs.

1590
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,344
- Two flying fish roe riceballs. - Two of them.

1591
00:56:10,345 --> 00:56:11,614
Four medium spicy grilled bones.

1592
00:56:11,615 --> 00:56:13,414
- Two cans of Coke Zero! - Okay.

1593
00:56:13,415 --> 00:56:15,814
(He orders drinks enthusiastically too.)

1594
00:56:15,815 --> 00:56:17,654
- Thank you. - Thanks. I'm worried if it's spicy.

1595
00:56:17,655 --> 00:56:20,125
(They're done ordering the grilled bones.)

1596
00:56:20,325 --> 00:56:21,895
John Andrew Park,

1597
00:56:22,195 --> 00:56:23,571
- can you eat spicy food? - "John Andrew Park."

1598
00:56:23,595 --> 00:56:25,124
Actually, I can't handle spicy food that well.

1599
00:56:25,125 --> 00:56:26,164
- Right? - Yes.

1600
00:56:26,165 --> 00:56:28,194
But when the owner says so,

1601
00:56:28,195 --> 00:56:30,464
I always order the one the owner recommends.

1602
00:56:30,465 --> 00:56:31,934
- That's right. - I might sweat...

1603
00:56:31,935 --> 00:56:34,904
and have a hard time, but if she recommends it,

1604
00:56:34,905 --> 00:56:36,134
I'd always go for it.

1605
00:56:36,135 --> 00:56:37,405
You'll always go for it.

1606
00:56:37,575 --> 00:56:40,304
I can't imagine it because I've never had it before.

1607
00:56:40,305 --> 00:56:41,921
- I don't know how it'll look. - Exactly.

1608
00:56:41,945 --> 00:56:43,344
What's the grilled bones for loyalty?

1609
00:56:43,345 --> 00:56:44,584
That must be really spicy.

1610
00:56:44,585 --> 00:56:46,514
- There's the super spicy one. - Yes.

1611
00:56:46,515 --> 00:56:48,854
Why don't you order it as a penalty for others?

1612
00:56:48,855 --> 00:56:50,155
As a penalty. I love a penalty.

1613
00:56:51,085 --> 00:56:52,154
- Wait. - It's too spicy.

1614
00:56:52,155 --> 00:56:53,424
Aren't you the only one who can have spicy food?

1615
00:56:53,425 --> 00:56:55,254
I don't like spicy food either.

1616
00:56:55,255 --> 00:56:56,295
- Really? - Yes.

1617
00:56:56,655 --> 00:56:58,495
It's hard to get in here.

1618
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:01,265
So we should order the spiciest one...

1619
00:57:01,595 --> 00:57:04,034
and give it a try. I'm just saying.

1620
00:57:04,035 --> 00:57:05,464
Okay. Ma'am!

1621
00:57:05,465 --> 00:57:06,504
(The request is accepted.)

1622
00:57:06,505 --> 00:57:08,585
We'll get two servings of grilled bones for loyalty.

1623
00:57:10,035 --> 00:57:12,115
The grilled bones for loyalty. They put two of them.

1624
00:57:12,175 --> 00:57:13,374
(They didn't know then...)

1625
00:57:13,375 --> 00:57:16,045
(what fuss the grilled bones for loyalty will cause.)

1626
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,284
(Surprised)

1627
00:57:18,285 --> 00:57:19,345
(Excited)

1628
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:21,254
- Gosh. I've never seen it. - Here come the grilled bones.

1629
00:57:21,255 --> 00:57:23,054
- Look at the visuals. - Hey!

1630
00:57:23,055 --> 00:57:24,255
That's...

1631
00:57:24,325 --> 00:57:26,685
This was what I had before. This is it.

1632
00:57:26,825 --> 00:57:28,594
- Are these... - Four servings.

1633
00:57:28,595 --> 00:57:29,835
- Medium-spicy? - Medium-spicy.

1634
00:57:30,395 --> 00:57:32,464
- That's... - This was what I had before.

1635
00:57:32,465 --> 00:57:33,924
(The meaty pork spines are drenched in red sauce.)

1636
00:57:33,925 --> 00:57:35,665
- It's visually stunning. - They look good.

1637
00:57:37,435 --> 00:57:39,965
(Flying fish roe riceballs that go well with them)

1638
00:57:40,435 --> 00:57:42,835
(And refreshing salad to ease the spiciness)

1639
00:57:43,805 --> 00:57:47,575
(The table of the first DMR)

1640
00:57:47,675 --> 00:57:50,344
Wear the glove and make riceballs.

1641
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:51,384
I'll make them.

1642
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:53,944
- Yes. Roll them into balls. - Into balls.

1643
00:57:53,945 --> 00:57:55,415
Make them.

1644
00:57:55,715 --> 00:57:57,384
This is how you enjoy it.

1645
00:57:57,385 --> 00:57:59,884
- You tore the meat apart here. - Yes.

1646
00:57:59,885 --> 00:58:03,155
Put the rice over the meat and top it with the salad.

1647
00:58:03,525 --> 00:58:06,165
(No need to say more!)

1648
00:58:06,495 --> 00:58:08,065
- Let's take a piece. - Okay.

1649
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:09,734
Here is one for the youngest.

1650
00:58:09,735 --> 00:58:10,765
Thank you.

1651
00:58:11,365 --> 00:58:12,864
- This is really... - Thank you.

1652
00:58:12,865 --> 00:58:15,905
(They take one piece of pork spines each.)

1653
00:58:16,835 --> 00:58:19,605
If you grab it the wrong way, do you know what happens?

1654
00:58:19,845 --> 00:58:22,075
- The meat comes off the bone. - It's well cooked.

1655
00:58:22,145 --> 00:58:23,474
It's so tender.

1656
00:58:23,475 --> 00:58:24,514
Thank you.

1657
00:58:24,515 --> 00:58:25,714
The bone comes off right away.

1658
00:58:25,715 --> 00:58:27,084
(The bones come off easily when he pulls lightly.)

1659
00:58:27,085 --> 00:58:29,445
- It comes off like this. - It means it's perfectly cooked.

1660
00:58:30,755 --> 00:58:32,584
The bone comes off right away.

1661
00:58:32,585 --> 00:58:35,224
When you look at the grain of the meat,

1662
00:58:35,225 --> 00:58:38,524
you can tell how tender it is.

1663
00:58:38,525 --> 00:58:39,795
I love what Yi Kyung's making.

1664
00:58:39,965 --> 00:58:41,935
When you eat gamjatang,

1665
00:58:42,395 --> 00:58:44,304
it's hard to take the meat off the bones.

1666
00:58:44,305 --> 00:58:45,585
That's why I didn't choose this.

1667
00:58:45,765 --> 00:58:47,834
I thought it'd be hard to take the meat off the bones.

1668
00:58:47,835 --> 00:58:49,835
But it comes off right away.

1669
00:58:50,675 --> 00:58:53,144
I thought I had to suck on it.

1670
00:58:53,145 --> 00:58:54,521
(He thought it'd be hard to eat it.)

1671
00:58:54,545 --> 00:58:56,974
(Finally, it's time to eat the grilled bones.)

1672
00:58:56,975 --> 00:58:58,745
I'll have it while the meat is dangling.

1673
00:59:00,645 --> 00:59:03,354
(When he puts the bone with lots of meat into his mouth...)

1674
00:59:03,355 --> 00:59:04,685
- The sauce is tasty. - Is it?

1675
00:59:05,055 --> 00:59:06,055
(Coming off)

1676
00:59:06,056 --> 00:59:07,824
Oh, my. It's not spicy.

1677
00:59:07,825 --> 00:59:09,554
(The meat comes into the mouth automatically.)

1678
00:59:09,555 --> 00:59:11,895
I should have thought wisely.

1679
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,595
(Chewing)

1680
00:59:15,995 --> 00:59:18,765
(Come on.)

1681
00:59:19,535 --> 00:59:20,975
- The sauce is tasty. - Is it?

1682
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:23,075
Jeez. It's not spicy.

1683
00:59:23,435 --> 00:59:24,905
Does it have a smoky flavor?

1684
00:59:25,175 --> 00:59:27,174
- Yes, it does. - It does.

1685
00:59:27,175 --> 00:59:28,375
(It does have a smoky flavor.)

1686
00:59:29,245 --> 00:59:34,355
(Devouring it while enjoying the mouthful of smoky flavor)

1687
00:59:36,885 --> 00:59:38,784
- Okay. - The owner told us to...

1688
00:59:38,785 --> 00:59:40,524
(Another way to enjoy the grilled bones)

1689
00:59:40,525 --> 00:59:42,054
- When you do it... - I put them like this.

1690
00:59:42,055 --> 00:59:43,754
The bones come off so easily.

1691
00:59:43,755 --> 00:59:45,594
I put the riceball like she said.

1692
00:59:45,595 --> 00:59:46,955
(Putting the riceball on the meat)

1693
00:59:47,065 --> 00:59:48,194
That too?

1694
00:59:48,195 --> 00:59:49,534
She told us to put the salad.

1695
00:59:49,535 --> 00:59:50,535
- It's... - Put it on.

1696
00:59:50,635 --> 00:59:52,134
I love what Yi Kyung's making.

1697
00:59:52,135 --> 00:59:54,875
(He made a grilled bone combo with salad.)

1698
00:59:55,535 --> 00:59:57,075
(Excited)

1699
00:59:57,235 --> 00:59:58,304
It looks good, doesn't it?

1700
00:59:58,305 --> 01:00:00,745
(How will it taste?)

1701
01:00:04,015 --> 01:00:05,615
I'll have it while the meat is dangling.

1702
01:00:07,345 --> 01:00:10,615
(A mouthful)

1703
01:00:11,085 --> 01:00:12,155
The sauce is good.

1704
01:00:12,325 --> 01:00:13,354
How is it?

1705
01:00:13,355 --> 01:00:14,624
(Curious)

1706
01:00:14,625 --> 01:00:16,025
It's not that spicy.

1707
01:00:16,995 --> 01:00:18,295
- And the meat... - Yes.

1708
01:00:19,395 --> 01:00:21,134
It's the same meat that's in gamjatang.

1709
01:00:21,135 --> 01:00:22,665
But it has absorbed the sauce so well.

1710
01:00:22,795 --> 01:00:26,404
It's so much more tender. It spreads in my mouth.

1711
01:00:26,405 --> 01:00:27,405
What is it similar to?

1712
01:00:27,406 --> 01:00:28,975
It's better than baby pork ribs.

1713
01:00:29,135 --> 01:00:30,175
- I see. - Yes.

1714
01:00:30,905 --> 01:00:32,745
What came to my mind as soon as I had it was..

1715
01:00:33,575 --> 01:00:35,115
The webfoot octopus with kelp noodles.

1716
01:00:36,445 --> 01:00:37,445
Actually...

1717
01:00:37,845 --> 01:00:40,345
Actually, I was going to say that as soon as I saw it.

1718
01:00:40,585 --> 01:00:42,305
The stir-webfoot octopus with kelp noodles?

1719
01:00:43,385 --> 01:00:44,784
(Mount Acha and Gunsan)

1720
01:00:44,785 --> 01:00:46,955
(The dish that charmed the members' palates)

1721
01:00:47,485 --> 01:00:50,255
(The stir-fried webfoot octopus with kelp noodles)

1722
01:00:50,695 --> 01:00:52,564
(The more...)

1723
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:55,764
(you have it...)

1724
01:00:55,765 --> 01:00:57,635
(Yes! This is it!)

1725
01:00:58,005 --> 01:01:00,035
(Hey. It's tasty.)

1726
01:01:00,505 --> 01:01:03,175
(The sweet and savory combo captivated the older members.)

1727
01:01:03,575 --> 01:01:04,805
The dressing...

1728
01:01:05,045 --> 01:01:08,275
is the familiar kiwi dressing.

1729
01:01:08,575 --> 01:01:09,645
It's similar to that.

1730
01:01:10,145 --> 01:01:11,484
The spicy food and kelp noodles.

1731
01:01:11,485 --> 01:01:14,044
- Those combos work well. - It tones down the spiciness.

1732
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,085
(We know how it tastes.)

1733
01:01:15,915 --> 01:01:16,984
- Look. - Goodness.

1734
01:01:16,985 --> 01:01:18,054
(He made another one in the meantime.)

1735
01:01:18,055 --> 01:01:19,485
That looks good.

1736
01:01:20,885 --> 01:01:22,925
If the meat breaks too much, it's not tasty, is it?

1737
01:01:23,295 --> 01:01:24,665
It has maintained the texture.

1738
01:01:25,665 --> 01:01:27,095
I want to try it like him.

1739
01:01:28,365 --> 01:01:30,065
It looked good.

1740
01:01:31,205 --> 01:01:33,965
(Sang Uk also makes the combo with the meat, riceball, and salad.)

1741
01:01:35,735 --> 01:01:39,375
(Taking a big bite)

1742
01:01:39,405 --> 01:01:41,045
It's much more tender.

1743
01:01:41,245 --> 01:01:43,214
(Amazed)

1744
01:01:43,215 --> 01:01:45,114
They go well with each other.

1745
01:01:45,115 --> 01:01:47,195
- What is this? - The dressing is amazing, isn't it?

1746
01:01:47,715 --> 01:01:48,854
It's like the famous sauce.

1747
01:01:48,855 --> 01:01:50,895
Are you going to refill the salad a few more times?

1748
01:01:51,125 --> 01:01:52,584
- More than that. - I see.

1749
01:01:52,585 --> 01:01:53,784
We have to get it refilled.

1750
01:01:53,785 --> 01:01:55,125
(They have to get it refilled.)

1751
01:01:57,925 --> 01:01:59,625
- Did you make a mistake? - Totally.

1752
01:02:01,235 --> 01:02:03,964
Exactly. You should have chosen wisely.

1753
01:02:03,965 --> 01:02:05,365
I followed you.

1754
01:02:05,835 --> 01:02:08,074
You chose the braised monkfish with a simple thought.

1755
01:02:08,075 --> 01:02:09,774
You chose what you can have...

1756
01:02:09,775 --> 01:02:11,105
quickly and neatly, didn't you?

1757
01:02:11,205 --> 01:02:13,344
(Yes. I didn't want to debone the meat.)

1758
01:02:13,345 --> 01:02:15,715
Honestly, I craved this more.

1759
01:02:15,915 --> 01:02:19,445
I think I made my 1st mistake after 30 shows.

1760
01:02:19,745 --> 01:02:20,845
Come on, Tae Hyun.

1761
01:02:22,515 --> 01:02:24,725
(Eating the grilled bones)

1762
01:02:25,155 --> 01:02:26,885
- Okay. Dong Hyun and Tae Hyun. - Yes?

1763
01:02:27,655 --> 01:02:30,254
Since you're regretting it so much,

1764
01:02:30,255 --> 01:02:32,765
you can join us if you're willing to pay for it.

1765
01:02:34,795 --> 01:02:37,195
We're not that stupid to do that.

1766
01:02:37,695 --> 01:02:39,564
We wouldn't be fooled by that.

1767
01:02:39,565 --> 01:02:41,205
(Really?)

1768
01:02:41,905 --> 01:02:45,375
(In the meantime...)

1769
01:02:45,605 --> 01:02:46,605
(Glancing)

1770
01:02:46,606 --> 01:02:48,774
(Grileld bones, grilled bones for loyalty)

1771
01:02:48,775 --> 01:02:51,415
(Tae Hyun checks out the menu.)

1772
01:02:51,915 --> 01:02:53,584
(Tapping)

1773
01:02:53,585 --> 01:02:54,654
(Glancing again)

1774
01:02:54,655 --> 01:02:56,815
Hey, did you order two flying fish roe riceballs?

1775
01:02:56,915 --> 01:02:58,315
- Yes. - They ordered two servings.

1776
01:03:00,885 --> 01:03:02,394
You eat this. Then you eat the riceball.

1777
01:03:02,395 --> 01:03:04,154
(Thinking seriously)

1778
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:06,194
- Tae Hyun is thinking about it. - I dabbed it in the sauce.

1779
01:03:06,195 --> 01:03:08,065
- Tae Hyun. - Show it to Tae Hyun.

1780
01:03:08,395 --> 01:03:10,435
Tae Hyun, take a look at this.

1781
01:03:10,535 --> 01:03:12,534
(Is there something else?)

1782
01:03:12,535 --> 01:03:14,904
Okay. He puts it in the sauce.

1783
01:03:14,905 --> 01:03:16,274
(Putting the riceball in the sauce)

1784
01:03:16,275 --> 01:03:18,605
(He tops it with the meat.)

1785
01:03:19,705 --> 01:03:21,174
If Sang Uk can eat it, it's not spicy at all.

1786
01:03:21,175 --> 01:03:22,175
Yes.

1787
01:03:22,176 --> 01:03:23,574
(Savoring)

1788
01:03:23,575 --> 01:03:24,715
It's ridiculous.

1789
01:03:25,145 --> 01:03:27,514
(Blinking)

1790
01:03:27,515 --> 01:03:29,561
This is the same pork spine as the one in gamjatang.

1791
01:03:29,585 --> 01:03:31,625
But I can take the bone out with one hand.

1792
01:03:31,755 --> 01:03:34,055
Look. I can debone it with one hand.

1793
01:03:34,485 --> 01:03:35,805
- The bone just comes off. - Yes.

1794
01:03:35,995 --> 01:03:37,324
You can suck on it now.

1795
01:03:37,325 --> 01:03:38,365
(He's falling into it.)

1796
01:03:38,625 --> 01:03:39,764
Is it a fake bone?

1797
01:03:39,765 --> 01:03:40,765
(Taking a bite of the meat separately)

1798
01:03:40,766 --> 01:03:41,995
Isn't it a fake bone? What?

1799
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,495
Wasn't it a bone?

1800
01:03:43,765 --> 01:03:45,865
That was a big bone.

1801
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:48,274
But when he sucked on it, only a small bone was left.

1802
01:03:48,275 --> 01:03:50,074
(It was meat.)

1803
01:03:50,075 --> 01:03:51,375
Gosh. It vanished.

1804
01:03:51,475 --> 01:03:52,674
It comes off automatically.

1805
01:03:52,675 --> 01:03:53,875
(It's a bone now.)

1806
01:03:54,545 --> 01:03:55,675
It's so tender.

1807
01:03:56,145 --> 01:03:58,285
I'm in!

1808
01:03:58,985 --> 01:04:01,184
(I want to join you!)

1809
01:04:01,185 --> 01:04:02,315
What? Tae Hyun!

1810
01:04:02,515 --> 01:04:04,855
You have to resist it. Don't do it!

1811
01:04:05,155 --> 01:04:07,224
- Tae Hyun. No. - I'm in!

1812
01:04:07,225 --> 01:04:09,224
Tae Hyun, resist it.

1813
01:04:09,225 --> 01:04:11,594
Even if they order one more, it's only 67 dollars.

1814
01:04:11,595 --> 01:04:13,064
- Did you do the math? - Yes.

1815
01:04:13,065 --> 01:04:14,425
- He calculated it. - I did.

1816
01:04:14,565 --> 01:04:15,664
Even if we order one more,

1817
01:04:15,665 --> 01:04:17,795
- it's only 67 dollars. - His calculator is on.

1818
01:04:18,005 --> 01:04:19,134
- No, Tae Hyun. - Why not?

1819
01:04:19,135 --> 01:04:20,135
No. Resist it.

1820
01:04:20,136 --> 01:04:22,835
We might win at the braised monkfish restaurant.

1821
01:04:23,175 --> 01:04:25,045
In that case, I want to pay for this too.

1822
01:04:25,175 --> 01:04:26,405
No. It's too late.

1823
01:04:26,705 --> 01:04:28,514
I'll pay 100 dollars and have it.

1824
01:04:28,515 --> 01:04:30,315
It's first-come, first-served.

1825
01:04:30,375 --> 01:04:31,585
I'll do it too.

1826
01:04:32,515 --> 01:04:33,814
Come on.

1827
01:04:33,815 --> 01:04:35,354
I don't need to get the penalty next week.

1828
01:04:35,355 --> 01:04:36,415
Exactly.

1829
01:04:36,685 --> 01:04:37,854
I can do it too.

1830
01:04:37,855 --> 01:04:39,985
It's 100 dollars. What did you three just do?

1831
01:04:40,325 --> 01:04:42,294
How many servings did they have?

1832
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,055
- Isn't it 6 servings? - It's 4 servings.

1833
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:45,895
It's for 4 people. And 2 more are coming.

1834
01:04:46,065 --> 01:04:47,165
It's because...

1835
01:04:47,365 --> 01:04:49,365
I see. That's for one serving.

1836
01:04:50,065 --> 01:04:51,504
- Gosh. I was wrong. - Were you?

1837
01:04:51,505 --> 01:04:52,704
The price is for one serving.

1838
01:04:52,705 --> 01:04:54,004
I thought it was for two.

1839
01:04:54,005 --> 01:04:55,105
- But no. - Really?

1840
01:04:55,435 --> 01:04:59,575
That means, if we order more it will be about 120 dollars.

1841
01:05:00,475 --> 01:05:02,814
- We've made our decision. - We were hasty.

1842
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:06,615
We lost our reason and almost joined you.

1843
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:08,755
- I'm hungry. - This is the super spicy one.

1844
01:05:09,685 --> 01:05:10,685
- Gosh. - The grilled bones for loyalty.

1845
01:05:10,686 --> 01:05:11,755
It's red.

1846
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:14,654
- It has a different color. - Do many people order it?

1847
01:05:14,655 --> 01:05:15,655
- It's different. - Of course.

1848
01:05:15,656 --> 01:05:17,554
The one who likes spicy food order this a lot.

1849
01:05:17,555 --> 01:05:19,525
Should I try the spicy one?

1850
01:05:21,335 --> 01:05:22,635
Are you going to eat it?

1851
01:05:23,265 --> 01:05:24,294
Is that the spicy one?

1852
01:05:24,295 --> 01:05:26,095
- He's eating the spicy one. - The spicy one?

1853
01:05:27,005 --> 01:05:29,375
It doesn't smell spicy. Smell it.

1854
01:05:30,335 --> 01:05:31,774
The medium-spicy is my limit.

1855
01:05:31,775 --> 01:05:33,174
Smell it, Yi Kyung.

1856
01:05:33,175 --> 01:05:34,444
(It doesn't smell that spicy.)

1857
01:05:34,445 --> 01:05:35,445
- Does it smell spicy? - Yes.

1858
01:05:35,446 --> 01:05:37,475
No. It falls apart when I grab it.

1859
01:05:38,085 --> 01:05:39,484
(Its tenderness gets a pass.)

1860
01:05:39,485 --> 01:05:41,615
- It doesn't smell that spicy. - No.

1861
01:05:43,955 --> 01:05:47,225
(Taking a big bite)

1862
01:05:48,555 --> 01:05:49,955
The spiciness kicks in later.

1863
01:05:52,225 --> 01:05:53,265
How is it?

1864
01:05:55,295 --> 01:05:56,764
- It must be spicy. - Watching them makes me sweat.

1865
01:05:56,765 --> 01:05:57,765
It's spicy.

1866
01:05:57,766 --> 01:05:58,905
(How is the very spicy one?)

1867
01:06:01,305 --> 01:06:02,404
I think it's okay.

1868
01:06:02,405 --> 01:06:03,504
- Is it okay? - Yes.

1869
01:06:03,505 --> 01:06:04,535
It isn't spicy.

1870
01:06:05,305 --> 01:06:06,985
- Is it okay? - Would you like to try one?

1871
01:06:07,545 --> 01:06:08,944
- You're sweating. - Wait a second.

1872
01:06:08,945 --> 01:06:10,075
Why are you sweating?

1873
01:06:10,915 --> 01:06:12,244
(Sweating)

1874
01:06:12,245 --> 01:06:13,514
- You're sweating. - Wait a second.

1875
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:14,585
Why are you sweating?

1876
01:06:14,615 --> 01:06:17,084
Why is your forehead glistening with sweat so suddenly?

1877
01:06:17,085 --> 01:06:18,454
It's hot in here.

1878
01:06:18,455 --> 01:06:20,824
- I mean, his forehead... - It's very spicy.

1879
01:06:20,825 --> 01:06:22,801
It's my first time seeing someone sweat from here.

1880
01:06:22,825 --> 01:06:23,855
Here.

1881
01:06:24,225 --> 01:06:25,865
- Sweat is pouring down his back. - Gosh.

1882
01:06:26,295 --> 01:06:27,625
Suddenly,

1883
01:06:28,235 --> 01:06:29,711
sweat is pouring down the back of his ears.

1884
01:06:29,735 --> 01:06:31,035
Oh, no.

1885
01:06:31,705 --> 01:06:33,565
- Gosh, it's spicy. - Oh, no.

1886
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,475
Is it spicy?

1887
01:06:35,535 --> 01:06:36,804
It must be very spicy.

1888
01:06:36,805 --> 01:06:37,934
He'll get an upset stomach.

1889
01:06:37,935 --> 01:06:39,305
(Being kind)

1890
01:06:40,345 --> 01:06:41,545
Why are you sweating so much?

1891
01:06:41,745 --> 01:06:43,144
(Pouring)

1892
01:06:43,145 --> 01:06:44,275
It's no joke.

1893
01:06:44,515 --> 01:06:45,515
Sang Uk.

1894
01:06:45,545 --> 01:06:46,784
That's how you fight the heat.

1895
01:06:46,785 --> 01:06:47,845
Fight the heat with heat.

1896
01:06:48,215 --> 01:06:49,815
His pants are getting soaked.

1897
01:06:50,085 --> 01:06:51,425
Seriously, his pants are soaked.

1898
01:06:51,825 --> 01:06:54,055
The spot where he rested his elbow got wet.

1899
01:06:55,425 --> 01:06:57,824
Since it's spicy, I'll give you more salad.

1900
01:06:57,825 --> 01:06:59,094
(The owner brings salad to put out the fire.)

1901
01:06:59,095 --> 01:07:00,201
- Hurry up and give it to him. - The side dishes too.

1902
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:01,764
One person is dying upon eating...

1903
01:07:01,765 --> 01:07:03,395
grilled bones for loyalty.

1904
01:07:03,895 --> 01:07:06,164
Right now, one person...

1905
01:07:06,165 --> 01:07:07,865
broke down.

1906
01:07:09,575 --> 01:07:12,744
(Sang Uk is malfunctioning.)

1907
01:07:12,745 --> 01:07:15,674
- He can't eat spicy food. - No.

1908
01:07:15,675 --> 01:07:17,215
Since they're eating so well...

1909
01:07:18,385 --> 01:07:19,944
Since they're eating so well...

1910
01:07:19,945 --> 01:07:21,884
(Opening his mouth wide)

1911
01:07:21,885 --> 01:07:23,385
I have to do this.

1912
01:07:23,455 --> 01:07:26,854
(He's putting out the fire.)

1913
01:07:26,855 --> 01:07:29,125
(Laughing)

1914
01:07:30,395 --> 01:07:31,695
It's no joke.

1915
01:07:32,925 --> 01:07:35,294
Right now, it looks like...

1916
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,595
Sang Uk...

1917
01:07:36,635 --> 01:07:38,965
is holding back as much as he can in order to make us eat.

1918
01:07:39,435 --> 01:07:41,365
He's holding back as much as he can.

1919
01:07:41,675 --> 01:07:43,234
Sang Uk, that's...

1920
01:07:43,235 --> 01:07:45,305
what they do at the otolaryngology clinic.

1921
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:48,715
(Suctioning is the best.)

1922
01:07:50,545 --> 01:07:53,215
That's a treatment for coughing.

1923
01:07:53,545 --> 01:07:55,685
- I'll try it. - A treatment for the throat.

1924
01:07:56,815 --> 01:07:58,754
What's up with Sang Uk's face?

1925
01:07:58,755 --> 01:08:00,085
(He feels dizzy.)

1926
01:08:00,125 --> 01:08:01,324
Wait a second.

1927
01:08:01,325 --> 01:08:02,525
Is it that bad?

1928
01:08:03,225 --> 01:08:04,594
This is scary.

1929
01:08:04,595 --> 01:08:06,494
(My goodness)

1930
01:08:06,495 --> 01:08:08,295
I can't eat anything.

1931
01:08:08,365 --> 01:08:09,565
You know...

1932
01:08:10,165 --> 01:08:11,235
Seriously.

1933
01:08:11,735 --> 01:08:12,805
Now,

1934
01:08:13,065 --> 01:08:14,665
the other team members are up.

1935
01:08:14,805 --> 01:08:16,535
It's a game.

1936
01:08:16,605 --> 01:08:17,634
Cute, small,

1937
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:18,704
- bright, bright. - Bright, bright.

1938
01:08:18,705 --> 01:08:20,274
Cute, small, bright, bright.

1939
01:08:20,275 --> 01:08:22,014
For example, the first person will say "Cute."

1940
01:08:22,015 --> 01:08:23,645
- Cute. - Cute, small.

1941
01:08:23,745 --> 01:08:25,184
Cute, small, bright.

1942
01:08:25,185 --> 01:08:26,745
Cute, small, bright, bright. That way,

1943
01:08:26,885 --> 01:08:28,655
you'll take turns to add one at a time.

1944
01:08:28,885 --> 01:08:30,354
The last person standing...

1945
01:08:30,355 --> 01:08:32,555
will eat the grilled bone of medium level of spiciness.

1946
01:08:32,655 --> 01:08:34,024
The two eliminated members...

1947
01:08:34,025 --> 01:08:36,125
will eat the very spicy one.

1948
01:08:36,195 --> 01:08:37,424
- You decide. - We'll go in this direction.

1949
01:08:37,425 --> 01:08:38,664
- Okay. I'll go first. - Let's do that.

1950
01:08:38,665 --> 01:08:40,094
Set, go.

1951
01:08:40,095 --> 01:08:41,765
- Cute. - Cute, small.

1952
01:08:41,895 --> 01:08:43,594
Cute, small, bright.

1953
01:08:43,595 --> 01:08:45,234
Cute, small, bright, bright.

1954
01:08:45,235 --> 01:08:47,634
Cute, small, bright, bright, cute.

1955
01:08:47,635 --> 01:08:48,905
- What? - It's correct.

1956
01:08:49,275 --> 01:08:51,774
Cute, small, bright, bright,

1957
01:08:51,775 --> 01:08:54,105
cute, small, bright.

1958
01:08:54,245 --> 01:08:55,414
- What? - You went too far.

1959
01:08:55,415 --> 01:08:56,735
- You're out. - You went too far.

1960
01:08:57,045 --> 01:08:58,184
(Tae Hyun went one step further.)

1961
01:08:58,185 --> 01:08:59,944
- Cute... - You went too far.

1962
01:08:59,945 --> 01:09:01,084
You did one more.

1963
01:09:01,085 --> 01:09:02,114
You did one more,

1964
01:09:02,115 --> 01:09:03,184
- Also, you said it like... - Okay.

1965
01:09:03,185 --> 01:09:04,815
- it was doomsday. - Okay.

1966
01:09:05,625 --> 01:09:06,784
- Cute... - Shall I start where we left off?

1967
01:09:06,785 --> 01:09:07,955
It's a 1-on-1 match.

1968
01:09:07,985 --> 01:09:08,994
It's a 1-on-1 match. Start from the beginning.

1969
01:09:08,995 --> 01:09:10,024
- I can't handle spicy food. - From the beginning?

1970
01:09:10,025 --> 01:09:11,054
- Start from the beginning. - I see.

1971
01:09:11,055 --> 01:09:12,524
Set, go.

1972
01:09:12,525 --> 01:09:14,225
- Cute. - Cute, small.

1973
01:09:14,365 --> 01:09:15,694
Cute, small, bright.

1974
01:09:15,695 --> 01:09:17,464
Cute, small, bright, bright.

1975
01:09:17,465 --> 01:09:19,504
Cute, small, bright, bright, cute.

1976
01:09:19,505 --> 01:09:21,604
Cute, small, bleak, bleak...

1977
01:09:21,605 --> 01:09:22,805
I messed up!

1978
01:09:23,435 --> 01:09:25,974
(Dong Hyun's future is bleak.)

1979
01:09:25,975 --> 01:09:27,075
You said it wrong.

1980
01:09:28,545 --> 01:09:29,614
- Thank you. - Dong Hyun, that was...

1981
01:09:29,615 --> 01:09:31,275
- This is hard. - Thank you.

1982
01:09:31,415 --> 01:09:34,185
- It's always the two of us. - Come on!

1983
01:09:34,545 --> 01:09:35,554
Let's go.

1984
01:09:35,555 --> 01:09:38,354
Seriously, this is a difficult game.

1985
01:09:38,355 --> 01:09:40,325
- Seriously. - It's hard.

1986
01:09:40,725 --> 01:09:42,324
- Seriously. - Thank goodness.

1987
01:09:42,325 --> 01:09:44,354
- Don't put more sauce on it. - Don't give me too much.

1988
01:09:44,355 --> 01:09:45,524
I can't eat it.

1989
01:09:45,525 --> 01:09:46,564
I'll divide it in half.

1990
01:09:46,565 --> 01:09:48,165
- Give us the same amount. - Of course.

1991
01:09:48,835 --> 01:09:50,264
I'm taking out the bones.

1992
01:09:50,265 --> 01:09:51,634
(Grilled bones for loyalty looks red and incredibly spicy.)

1993
01:09:51,635 --> 01:09:53,515
Eat the dish with rice and chase it with salad.

1994
01:09:54,190 --> 01:09:55,924
- I can't eat it. - I'll divide it in half.

1995
01:09:56,190 --> 01:09:57,890
- Give us the same amount. - Of course.

1996
01:09:58,600 --> 01:09:59,899
I'm taking out the bones.

1997
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:01,359
(Grilled bones for loyalty looks red and incredibly spicy.)

1998
01:10:01,360 --> 01:10:03,329
Eat the dish with rice and chase it with salad.

1999
01:10:03,330 --> 01:10:04,369
That's right.

2000
01:10:04,370 --> 01:10:05,669
They didn't give you one.

2001
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:09,010
(John Andrew Park tries the dish of medium level of spiciness first.)

2002
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:12,710
(I see.)

2003
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,110
(Is it okay?)

2004
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:16,350
To me,

2005
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:18,479
the medium level is spicy.

2006
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:19,950
(The medium level is spicy.)

2007
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,549
The medium level is spicy too.

2008
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:24,590
(Filled with worries)

2009
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,090
Tae Hyun, eat it.

2010
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,619
Eat more.

2011
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:28,659
Take it out.

2012
01:10:28,660 --> 01:10:30,529
- Shall we feed each other? - I'm so happy.

2013
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:32,659
Shall we do that?

2014
01:10:32,660 --> 01:10:34,029
For goodness' sake.

2015
01:10:34,030 --> 01:10:35,330
- Bring it on. - Okay.

2016
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:37,246
- We'll feed each other then. - Let's do it.

2017
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:38,399
Bring it on.

2018
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,170
- For goodness' sake. - I'll end you.

2019
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:41,340
Bring it on.

2020
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:42,940
- Dong Hyun, add some rice. - Okay.

2021
01:10:43,010 --> 01:10:44,539
- One... - It's too much.

2022
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:45,639
One, two, three.

2023
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,840
(Going in at the same time)

2024
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:50,210
Tae Hyun, come on.

2025
01:10:50,211 --> 01:10:53,280
(Laughing)

2026
01:10:53,650 --> 01:10:54,780
Tae Hyun, come on.

2027
01:10:55,120 --> 01:10:56,219
It didn't go into his mouth.

2028
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:57,900
(Come here! You need to finish your food.)

2029
01:10:58,450 --> 01:11:02,230
(Please don't do this here.)

2030
01:11:02,490 --> 01:11:03,859
- It didn't go into his mouth. - Oh, no.

2031
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,329
(In tatters)

2032
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:06,400
Hold on.

2033
01:11:06,830 --> 01:11:08,459
- Dong Hyun, it's too spicy. - Please wipe my face.

2034
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:10,200
(He didn't eat with his face.)

2035
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:11,999
- Dong Hyun, it's too spicy. - Please wipe my face.

2036
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,139
(Grilled bones for loyalty left them with no loyalty.)

2037
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,740
Wipe your mouth with a wet wipe.

2038
01:11:16,210 --> 01:11:17,869
Tae Hyun, wipe your cheeks.

2039
01:11:17,870 --> 01:11:18,980
A wet wipe.

2040
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:21,539
Your skin will sting later. Your face.

2041
01:11:21,540 --> 01:11:23,510
- Hey. - Hurry up and eat this.

2042
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:26,580
My eyes are stinging!

2043
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:28,749
Did you put it in my eyes?

2044
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:30,189
No, I didn't.

2045
01:11:30,190 --> 01:11:31,670
(They can't really blame each other.)

2046
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,160
The spiciness is hitting me.

2047
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:36,429
My nose stings.

2048
01:11:36,430 --> 01:11:37,589
That's right. It stings.

2049
01:11:37,590 --> 01:11:38,660
Wipe your face.

2050
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:40,399
It was a spicy one.

2051
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:43,130
(They ate grilled bones for loyalty with their faces.)

2052
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:46,669
Hey, it's okay...

2053
01:11:46,670 --> 01:11:47,999
when you eat the salad.

2054
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:50,409
- It isn't overly spicy. - Come on.

2055
01:11:50,410 --> 01:11:52,409
- You're right. - It's nice. It's okay.

2056
01:11:52,410 --> 01:11:53,439
(Did a little bit of salad put out the fire in their mouths?)

2057
01:11:53,440 --> 01:11:54,739
- Really? - Yes.

2058
01:11:54,740 --> 01:11:56,279
- It's tasty. - Really?

2059
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:57,350
It's fine.

2060
01:11:58,210 --> 01:11:59,850
- I mean... - My goodness.

2061
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:01,580
It's fine.

2062
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,719
It's fine.

2063
01:12:07,720 --> 01:12:08,760
It isn't spicy.

2064
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,329
(Confused)

2065
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:11,360
I strongly recommend it.

2066
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,900
Please give us two more salads.

2067
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:15,869
Ma'am.

2068
01:12:15,870 --> 01:12:17,729
(They're speaking nonsense.)

2069
01:12:17,730 --> 01:12:18,869
Are your eyes okay?

2070
01:12:18,870 --> 01:12:20,400
My skin stings so much.

2071
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:23,169
The skin underneath my eyes stings more...

2072
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:24,640
than my mouth.

2073
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,009
My nose too. Gosh, it stings.

2074
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:28,016
(I'll only eat what the owner recommended.)

2075
01:12:28,040 --> 01:12:29,549
- Here's the salad. - Okay.

2076
01:12:29,550 --> 01:12:30,550
Is it spicy?

2077
01:12:30,551 --> 01:12:31,849
- Is it very spicy? Is it okay? - It's okay.

2078
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:32,880
It's tasty.

2079
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,980
You guys aren't tasting it.

2080
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:36,560
You guys are eating to survive.

2081
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:40,589
(Let's hurry up...)

2082
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:43,889
(and eat.)

2083
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:45,060
Did you finish it?

2084
01:12:45,130 --> 01:12:46,630
If we don't eat it, we'll die.

2085
01:12:48,060 --> 01:12:52,370
(Grilled bones for loyalty helped them check their loyalty.)

2086
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:55,140
Please give us the bill.

2087
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:57,039
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2088
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,709
The number is neat. It's 100 dollars.

2089
01:12:58,710 --> 01:12:59,710
(Total: 100 dollars)

2090
01:12:59,711 --> 01:13:00,740
Really?

2091
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:03,050
If you lose in the individual match,

2092
01:13:03,350 --> 01:13:05,920
you'll be one step closer to wearing funny makeup next week.

2093
01:13:06,320 --> 01:13:07,550
You're right.

2094
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,349
Funny makeup is on the line too.

2095
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:10,789
- You're right. - Let's do this.

2096
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:12,020
(I need to get this right.)

2097
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:14,189
Please give us the quiz...

2098
01:13:14,190 --> 01:13:15,390
for the grilled bones.

2099
01:13:15,490 --> 01:13:17,190
Here comes the quiz.

2100
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:19,899
Pigs are sensitive to hierarchy...

2101
01:13:19,900 --> 01:13:22,000
from the moment they're born.

2102
01:13:22,130 --> 01:13:24,930
Pigs in a pigsty in particular...

2103
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:26,299
choose "Blank..."

2104
01:13:26,300 --> 01:13:28,000
by hierarchy.

2105
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,309
It's too easy.

2106
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:31,190
(Pigs in a pigsty choose "Blank" by hierarchy.)

2107
01:13:31,510 --> 01:13:33,379
What is this?

2108
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:34,910
- Among pigs? - Yes.

2109
01:13:35,810 --> 01:13:37,110
It's too easy.

2110
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:40,119
There aren't many things pigs can do in a pigsty.

2111
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,089
- It's either eating... - You know...

2112
01:13:42,090 --> 01:13:43,390
- Or pooping. - or pooping.

2113
01:13:43,450 --> 01:13:46,090
- I thought of something else. - Okay.

2114
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:47,690
In a pigsty...

2115
01:13:47,860 --> 01:13:48,889
Gosh, it was spicy.

2116
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:51,729
Space is limited.

2117
01:13:51,730 --> 01:13:54,100
So perhaps it's the order...

2118
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,399
they lie down to sleep.

2119
01:13:56,400 --> 01:13:57,699
(How about the order of lying down?)

2120
01:13:57,700 --> 01:14:00,020
- Something like that. - Will animals complain about that?

2121
01:14:00,170 --> 01:14:02,010
Maybe they headbutt the pig of a lower rank...

2122
01:14:02,040 --> 01:14:04,210
if it lies down first.

2123
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,710
I think it's the order of eating...

2124
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,540
of the location of the food.

2125
01:14:09,110 --> 01:14:11,049
- Wouldn't they be sensitive? - The order of eating is nice.

2126
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,319
Pigs are associated with eating.

2127
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,000
The order of eating entered my mind first.

2128
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:15,890
(Is that so?)

2129
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:18,296
- Do you think it's about sleeping? - I think it's about sleeping.

2130
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:19,420
What do you think?

2131
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:21,760
- I think it's about eating. - Eating?

2132
01:14:21,920 --> 01:14:23,190
The big divisions are...

2133
01:14:23,460 --> 01:14:25,629
the order of eating...

2134
01:14:25,630 --> 01:14:27,129
and the order of pooping.

2135
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:28,730
I think those are the two possibilities.

2136
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:29,829
(Feeling unsure, Sang Uk goes with their opinions.)

2137
01:14:29,830 --> 01:14:31,130
Okay.

2138
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:33,100
In accordance with hierarchy...

2139
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,639
In accordance with hierarchy, they decide on this.

2140
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:38,340
They decide on the order and location.

2141
01:14:38,910 --> 01:14:39,910
That's what we think.

2142
01:14:39,911 --> 01:14:41,309
(This pig distracts them.)

2143
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:42,710
We'll give our answer right away.

2144
01:14:43,080 --> 01:14:45,519
(Oinking)

2145
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:46,780
After eating spicy food...

2146
01:14:47,680 --> 01:14:48,680
(The aftereffect of eating spicy food)

2147
01:14:48,681 --> 01:14:49,689
- It was spicy. - Let me answer.

2148
01:14:49,690 --> 01:14:51,150
- Pigs... - It was spicy.

2149
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:53,160
Pigs decide on...

2150
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:56,160
the order and location of meals in accordance with the hierarchy.

2151
01:14:57,190 --> 01:14:59,000
- The order and location of meals. - Yes.

2152
01:14:59,900 --> 01:15:04,400
(Will it be correct?)

2153
01:15:04,670 --> 01:15:06,239
(Answer: The order and location of meals)

2154
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,770
It's incorrect.

2155
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:11,269
It's incorrect.

2156
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:13,239
(Happy versus sad)

2157
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:14,380
We did it.

2158
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:15,910
(Oinking)

2159
01:15:16,210 --> 01:15:17,979
(Annoyed)

2160
01:15:17,980 --> 01:15:19,079
- We did it. - Let me answer.

2161
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,120
We did it.

2162
01:15:20,550 --> 01:15:22,289
- Seriously. - The sleeping location.

2163
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:23,419
(Answer: The sleeping location)

2164
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:24,549
The sleeping location.

2165
01:15:24,550 --> 01:15:26,690
It has to be the sleeping location.

2166
01:15:26,720 --> 01:15:28,296
- That's the only option left. - I think...

2167
01:15:28,320 --> 01:15:31,360
I think the mommy pig always lay down at the end,

2168
01:15:31,460 --> 01:15:32,900
not the center.

2169
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:34,399
The sleeping location.

2170
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,569
(Answer: The sleeping location)

2171
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:36,570
Correct.

2172
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:40,340
(- Congratulations. - I'm sorry.)

2173
01:15:40,341 --> 01:15:41,399
- Good. - He did it in one go.

2174
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,309
Do they prefer sticking to their mom?

2175
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:44,739
(Sang Uk had a good hunch, but he wasn't speedy enough.)

2176
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:45,879
- Let me explain. - Okay.

2177
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,339
Pigs divide up the pigsty into a living space...

2178
01:15:48,340 --> 01:15:50,080
and a toilet.

2179
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:52,109
- I see that they're clean. - The pigs of higher ranks...

2180
01:15:52,110 --> 01:15:54,980
sleep far from the toilet.

2181
01:15:55,280 --> 01:15:57,219
I'll give you another quiz.

2182
01:15:57,220 --> 01:15:58,396
(Yi Kyung and Sang Uk will compete to avoid paying.)

2183
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:00,259
The first streetcar of Korea...

2184
01:16:00,260 --> 01:16:03,089
began running in 1899.

2185
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:07,060
It was a line that traveled between Seodaemun and Cheongnyangni.

2186
01:16:07,200 --> 01:16:10,199
When the last streetcar passed in summer,

2187
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:13,170
people brought out picnic mats.

2188
01:16:13,370 --> 01:16:15,339
They did so to use "Blank..."

2189
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:18,609
to enjoy the summer nights in a cool way.

2190
01:16:18,610 --> 01:16:21,280
- Let me answer. I think... - He's cool.

2191
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:23,810
It's the streetcar shade.

2192
01:16:24,110 --> 01:16:25,949
- The streetcar shade. - When the streetcar stopped,

2193
01:16:25,950 --> 01:16:28,989
they laid out the picnic mats in the shade to rest.

2194
01:16:28,990 --> 01:16:30,249
(Answer: Streetcar shade)

2195
01:16:30,250 --> 01:16:31,550
- Incorrect. - That can't be it.

2196
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:33,389
- After the last streetcar? - Let me answer.

2197
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:37,190
The steel track became cool when the sun set.

2198
01:16:37,330 --> 01:16:38,689
- I think that's the answer. - The steel track.

2199
01:16:38,690 --> 01:16:41,429
- The streetcar track. - It became cool after sunset,

2200
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:42,430
so they laid out the picnic mats.

2201
01:16:42,431 --> 01:16:43,470
Why would it be cool?

2202
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:44,830
It's steel.

2203
01:16:45,700 --> 01:16:47,100
- Correct. - Okay.

2204
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:48,270
Really?

2205
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:50,469
- Did they lie down on the track? - Steel.

2206
01:16:50,470 --> 01:16:53,579
Back then, the streetcar track was popular as a pillow.

2207
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:55,510
A pillow. That makes sense.

2208
01:16:55,980 --> 01:16:57,710
- A pillow. - The steel became cool.

2209
01:16:58,450 --> 01:16:59,779
That means Sang Uk...

2210
01:16:59,780 --> 01:17:01,249
(Sang Uk is one step closer to the penalty.)

2211
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:03,150
My goodness. One hundred dollars.

2212
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:04,690
Sang Uk, thank you for the food.

2213
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:06,460
Thank you.

2214
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,629
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

2215
01:17:10,630 --> 01:17:11,790
(They pay for the first DMR.)

2216
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,199
(People gather around at the Gyeongdong Market...)

2217
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,830
(to visit the good restaurants in the evening.)

2218
01:17:19,640 --> 01:17:21,369
- Hello. - Hello.

2219
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:22,970
Look at the alleys.

2220
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:25,140
- Where is it? - I'm really hungry now.

2221
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:27,710
- It has the photo of the owner. - This must be the place.

2222
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:29,249
- The braised monkfish place? - This is it.

2223
01:17:29,250 --> 01:17:30,380
This is it.

2224
01:17:30,780 --> 01:17:33,250
This place is over 20 years old. My goodness.

2225
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:36,519
- It's packed with customers. - It's packed.

2226
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:38,120
(The restaurant is packed.)

2227
01:17:38,550 --> 01:17:40,560
It was on TV many times.

2228
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:43,490
We trust the restaurant that has the owner's face.

2229
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:48,360
(Gyeongdong Market, Second DMR)

2230
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:49,699
(This restaurant gets a steady stream of customers.)

2231
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:53,170
It's tasty. I've been coming here for over 20 years.

2232
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:56,310
The braised monkfish is hearty and tasty.

2233
01:17:56,510 --> 01:17:59,680
(There are regulars who go back many years.)

2234
01:18:00,540 --> 01:18:03,750
I heard that this place was good, so I came from Dongtan.

2235
01:18:04,410 --> 01:18:05,979
It isn't too spicy.

2236
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:08,079
The taste makes you eat endlessly.

2237
01:18:08,080 --> 01:18:09,420
It's definitely tasty.

2238
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:11,400
(People of all generations raise their thumbs.)

2239
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:14,190
(DMR 2, Braised monkfish)

2240
01:18:14,390 --> 01:18:15,890
- Please go upstairs. - Hello.

2241
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:18,289
- There are so many people. - Hello.

2242
01:18:18,290 --> 01:18:19,399
(People welcome them with a round of applause.)

2243
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,499
- It's a popular restaurant, right? - Yes.

2244
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:22,770
I saw another thumbs up.

2245
01:18:23,430 --> 01:18:24,869
- This? - We saw it again.

2246
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:26,400
That man gave a thumbs up.

2247
01:18:26,900 --> 01:18:28,469
I guess that's a common gesture here.

2248
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:29,839
(They look forward to the best taste and quality.)

2249
01:18:29,840 --> 01:18:32,580
Gyeongdong Market has so many good restaurants.

2250
01:18:33,210 --> 01:18:34,510
- That's right. - It does.

2251
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:38,209
- Sir, hello. - Hello.

2252
01:18:38,210 --> 01:18:39,919
- Sir, please come here. - Hello.

2253
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:41,279
- Please sit next to me. - Okay.

2254
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:42,419
- Please come here. - Okay.

2255
01:18:42,420 --> 01:18:44,449
I heard that you were 1 of the 6 people who learned...

2256
01:18:44,450 --> 01:18:45,989
the braised monkfish recipe from a master.

2257
01:18:45,990 --> 01:18:49,189
Yes. When I decided on the menu of the restaurant,

2258
01:18:49,190 --> 01:18:51,829
- I got introduced to a master. - Okay.

2259
01:18:51,830 --> 01:18:54,259
The master taught the recipe to six restaurants in the nation...

2260
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:56,100
and passed away 12 years ago.

2261
01:18:56,230 --> 01:18:58,729
Thus, other restaurants don't know the recipe.

2262
01:18:58,730 --> 01:19:00,699
That's why I work hard with pride.

2263
01:19:00,700 --> 01:19:01,739
(He has protected the recipe with pride.)

2264
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:04,439
- The recipe must be different. - How old is the restaurant?

2265
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,809
I opened the braised monkfish restaurant in 2002.

2266
01:19:06,810 --> 01:19:09,050
If you look over here, it says, "Since 2002."

2267
01:19:09,380 --> 01:19:10,849
Did excited customers pour in because of the fourth place?

2268
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:12,279
That's right. It was the time of the international soccer match.

2269
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,919
Every time the Korean team scored, I gave out freebies.

2270
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,719
(Freebies poured out with a successful goal!)

2271
01:19:16,720 --> 01:19:19,820
- That energy got you this far. - Customers got many free drinks.

2272
01:19:20,460 --> 01:19:22,159
Please recommend us...

2273
01:19:22,160 --> 01:19:24,989
- a must-have dish with your soul. - That's right.

2274
01:19:24,990 --> 01:19:27,399
- We have braised monkfish... - Braised monkfish.

2275
01:19:27,400 --> 01:19:29,070
With a live small octopus.

2276
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,770
Using the broth that's made with 16 natural ingredients,

2277
01:19:34,240 --> 01:19:36,569
we boil monkfish and bean sprouts.

2278
01:19:36,570 --> 01:19:38,169
Then we stir-fry them with the sauce.

2279
01:19:38,170 --> 01:19:39,409
(Braised monkfish with small octopus gets stir-fried in the sauce.)

2280
01:19:39,410 --> 01:19:42,380
We have a nice recipe that isn't too spicy or salty.

2281
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:46,179
Braised monkfish with small octopus is a must-have.

2282
01:19:46,180 --> 01:19:47,619
What else should we have?

2283
01:19:47,620 --> 01:19:49,449
Then we have octopus soup.

2284
01:19:49,450 --> 01:19:52,219
It's a clear soup that contains live small octopus.

2285
01:19:52,220 --> 01:19:54,319
The octopus soup has a clean taste.

2286
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,959
- It's a healthy dish. - Yes.

2287
01:19:55,960 --> 01:19:58,229
- Before braised monkfish, - Okay.

2288
01:19:58,230 --> 01:19:59,999
You'll get small octopus WCS.

2289
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,699
- WCS. - WCS. Then...

2290
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:02,700
What's WCS?

2291
01:20:02,701 --> 01:20:05,499
I cut up a live small octopus...

2292
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:07,269
and add water parsley and chojang.

2293
01:20:07,270 --> 01:20:09,869
- That's why it's WCS. - Water parsley, chojang, sashimi.

2294
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:10,909
I came up with the recipe.

2295
01:20:10,910 --> 01:20:12,146
- You shorten all sorts of things. - Yes.

2296
01:20:12,170 --> 01:20:13,979
- You shorten all sorts of things. - Yes.

2297
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:16,249
Then we'll have braised monkfish with live small octopus.

2298
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:18,049
- Octopus soup too? - A large size.

2299
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:19,119
- Okay. - If we order WCS as well,

2300
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:20,320
the total will be 100 dollars.

2301
01:20:20,450 --> 01:20:22,689
If we order the soup as well, it'll go over the amount.

2302
01:20:22,690 --> 01:20:25,389
- Don't think about 100 dollars. - Seriously.

2303
01:20:25,390 --> 01:20:27,190
- Come on. - If you do that, it won't be fun.

2304
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:29,389
- The taste... - No matter what you do,

2305
01:20:29,390 --> 01:20:30,990
I'll make sure it goes over 100 dollars.

2306
01:20:31,030 --> 01:20:32,390
I looked at the price first.

2307
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,599
- I'll eat rice too. - All right.

2308
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,429
- It'll go over. Okay then. - Just order what you want.

2309
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:37,529
- Don't worry about it. - What should we do then?

2310
01:20:37,530 --> 01:20:38,770
Eat whatever you want.

2311
01:20:38,830 --> 01:20:40,539
One braised monkfish with live small octopus,

2312
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:42,239
- one small octopus soup, - Small.

2313
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,870
- and one WCS. - Then...

2314
01:20:43,940 --> 01:20:45,370
Okay. Thank you.

2315
01:20:45,570 --> 01:20:48,880
If we fail to get the quiz right, one of us will get the penalty.

2316
01:20:49,810 --> 01:20:50,810
(I don't know about that. I'm just going to eat.)

2317
01:20:50,811 --> 01:20:51,980
I'll eat properly.

2318
01:20:52,180 --> 01:20:54,249
It won't be cut up ahead of time, right?

2319
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:56,819
- The owner will cut it, right? - Yes.

2320
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:58,500
Maybe we'll need to eat like Choi Min Sik.

2321
01:20:59,590 --> 01:21:00,719
It'll be like "Oldboy."

2322
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:02,729
- A whole small octopus? - He bites into it.

2323
01:21:02,730 --> 01:21:03,730
(From "Oldboy")

2324
01:21:03,731 --> 01:21:05,359
- Every time I watch it... - Do you know how they got...

2325
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:06,559
the sound?

2326
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,529
They used rubber gloves and ketchup.

2327
01:21:08,530 --> 01:21:09,530
(They created a realistic sound with rubber gloves and ketchup.)

2328
01:21:09,531 --> 01:21:11,930
- Rubber gloves. - Rubber gloves and ketchup.

2329
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:16,010
- There are specialists. - Foley artists.

2330
01:21:16,270 --> 01:21:18,670
- My dad did that. - What? A foley artist?

2331
01:21:19,070 --> 01:21:20,839
- He made sound effects... - Sound effects.

2332
01:21:20,840 --> 01:21:22,040
- at KBS. - Really?

2333
01:21:23,410 --> 01:21:25,450
- He made the galloping sounds. - Galloping sounds.

2334
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:28,580
(Tae Hyun's parents met as TBC's voice actors in 1968.)

2335
01:21:29,150 --> 01:21:32,559
(After marriage, his dad went into sound effects.)

2336
01:21:32,560 --> 01:21:36,460
(He was in charge of sound effects for 27 years.)

2337
01:21:36,830 --> 01:21:39,459
My dad created sound effects...

2338
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:41,559
for TV shows.

2339
01:21:41,560 --> 01:21:43,400
- That's right. - He did that back in the day.

2340
01:21:43,470 --> 01:21:44,599
- The food is here. - Yes.

2341
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,139
(A live small octopus enters.)

2342
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:49,070
There's a live small octopus inside.

2343
01:21:49,370 --> 01:21:50,770
It's inside.

2344
01:21:51,870 --> 01:21:53,779
I'll cut it first.

2345
01:21:53,780 --> 01:21:56,609
(The owner gets ready to fight the strong octopus.)

2346
01:21:56,610 --> 01:21:58,179
- It's escaping. - It's a ruckus.

2347
01:21:58,180 --> 01:21:59,279
It was still a moment ago.

2348
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,350
- It's strong. - Who wants it first?

2349
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:03,449
- When I give you a piece, - Okay.

2350
01:22:03,450 --> 01:22:06,520
Eat it with some water parsley and chojang.

2351
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:08,489
- Like this? - Here you go.

2352
01:22:08,490 --> 01:22:10,889
- It's fresh. - Eat it with chojang.

2353
01:22:10,890 --> 01:22:12,089
(1. Cut as much small octopus as you like.)

2354
01:22:12,090 --> 01:22:13,506
(2. Top with water parsley and sprinkle chojang.)

2355
01:22:13,530 --> 01:22:15,600
- It's like Venom! - Hold on.

2356
01:22:16,200 --> 01:22:17,569
- Listen. - It's fresh, right?

2357
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:19,816
If you leave it be, it'll mix the ingredients on its own.

2358
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,470
- You're right. - Yes.

2359
01:22:21,570 --> 01:22:22,770
It's overly fresh.

2360
01:22:23,470 --> 01:22:25,939
- It mixed the ingredients. - Yes.

2361
01:22:25,940 --> 01:22:28,209
- It does it on its own. - Be still.

2362
01:22:28,210 --> 01:22:29,649
- It mixed the ingredients well. - Leave some behind.

2363
01:22:29,650 --> 01:22:32,349
Dong Hyun will be able to eat a big one,

2364
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:33,449
- right? - Of course.

2365
01:22:33,450 --> 01:22:35,889
- You do this well. - Of course.

2366
01:22:35,890 --> 01:22:36,890
(I believe in you, Cicada Kim.)

2367
01:22:36,891 --> 01:22:39,150
I'm a fan of UFC.

2368
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:40,619
Why didn't you cut mine?

2369
01:22:40,620 --> 01:22:42,036
It mixes the ingredients on its own.

2370
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:44,860
- Why didn't you cut mine? - It's okay.

2371
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:46,429
- Why didn't you cut mine? - You're a UFC fighter.

2372
01:22:46,430 --> 01:22:48,329
- Try a big piece. - A UFC fighter.

2373
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:49,900
Bite into it.

2374
01:22:49,970 --> 01:22:51,099
I got a whole leg.

2375
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:53,699
- It's okay. - You must get scared easily.

2376
01:22:53,700 --> 01:22:55,339
Look at this. It's too strong.

2377
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:57,309
(Cicada Kim versus Live small octopus)

2378
01:22:57,310 --> 01:22:59,610
It's so strong. Look at this. How is it so strong?

2379
01:22:59,910 --> 01:23:01,580
- Sir, it's a whole leg. - Seriously.

2380
01:23:01,810 --> 01:23:03,149
It's strong. Ouch!

2381
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:04,630
- Sir, it's a whole leg. - Seriously.

2382
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:07,750
(The live small octopus fights back with an armbar.)

2383
01:23:09,450 --> 01:23:10,519
It got on my hand.

2384
01:23:10,520 --> 01:23:12,619
- You get scared easily. - Seriously.

2385
01:23:12,620 --> 01:23:14,590
- You get scared easily. - That's good.

2386
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:16,959
Hey, I can't pick it up.

2387
01:23:16,960 --> 01:23:19,159
- Tae Hyun, it's really strong. - It's beyond fresh.

2388
01:23:19,160 --> 01:23:20,920
(Team Braised Monkfish finally gets a bite.)

2389
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:22,899
- It's beyond fresh. - I can't pick it up.

2390
01:23:22,900 --> 01:23:24,776
(It's hard to pick up the octopus since it's so fresh.)

2391
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,469
(He wraps it up in water parsley and eats it whole.)

2392
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:28,470
How is it?

2393
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:30,240
I can't pull it.

2394
01:23:30,810 --> 01:23:31,810
Its strength...

2395
01:23:35,940 --> 01:23:38,709
We usually chop up live small octopus...

2396
01:23:38,710 --> 01:23:40,249
and eat it with oil and salt.

2397
01:23:40,250 --> 01:23:42,019
- I haven't had it with chojang. - Me too.

2398
01:23:42,020 --> 01:23:43,549
The water parsley is so fresh.

2399
01:23:43,550 --> 01:23:45,220
The aroma of water parsley is no joke.

2400
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,089
It becomes a delicacy when it's with water parsley.

2401
01:23:48,090 --> 01:23:50,860
The water parsley and the sauce go very well together.

2402
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:52,030
It's so fragrant.

2403
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:54,459
From Dong Hyun's plate,

2404
01:23:54,460 --> 01:23:56,206
I keep hearing the sound of the bubble wrap getting popped.

2405
01:23:56,230 --> 01:23:57,930
It won't come off.

2406
01:23:58,530 --> 01:24:02,199
- The roof of the mouth... - It won't come off.

2407
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,740
- It dropped! - Hey!

2408
01:24:03,910 --> 01:24:06,109
(He gets the dropped octopus.)

2409
01:24:06,110 --> 01:24:08,339
I just had a dropped piece,

2410
01:24:08,340 --> 01:24:10,550
but it has the aroma of water parsley.

2411
01:24:11,450 --> 01:24:14,350
- All right. - It's here.

2412
01:24:14,380 --> 01:24:16,389
- Please put it here. - The pride of my restaurant,

2413
01:24:16,390 --> 01:24:18,350
braised monkfish is here.

2414
01:24:18,690 --> 01:24:21,289
It contains a big octopus...

2415
01:24:21,290 --> 01:24:23,259
that's cooked.

2416
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:26,359
After you're done with half of it,

2417
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:28,399
ask me to stir-fry some rice.

2418
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,930
Then I'll make fried rice that tastes amazing.

2419
01:24:31,430 --> 01:24:34,499
(Shall we eat the main dish, braised monkfish?)

2420
01:24:34,500 --> 01:24:35,939
- This is a must. - Please enjoy the food.

2421
01:24:35,940 --> 01:24:37,039
- Okay. - Thank you.

2422
01:24:37,040 --> 01:24:38,309
This is a must.

2423
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:40,039
- Bean sprouts. - This is a must.

2424
01:24:40,040 --> 01:24:41,079
Are these bean sprouts?

2425
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:42,360
(He gets a lot of bean sprouts.)

2426
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:44,879
Is this braised monkfish different?

2427
01:24:44,880 --> 01:24:45,880
(He eats it right away.)

2428
01:24:46,780 --> 01:24:48,380
(Eating with gusto)

2429
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,219
(It's coming up.)

2430
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:52,549
(It's the scent of the sea!)

2431
01:24:52,550 --> 01:24:54,189
It does look different though.

2432
01:24:54,190 --> 01:24:55,320
It does look different.

2433
01:24:58,890 --> 01:25:00,400
- Andrew? - Gosh, it's Johnchelin.

2434
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,530
(Eating)

2435
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:05,100
You're eating very sophisticatedly.

2436
01:25:05,330 --> 01:25:07,470
- You eat so neatly. - Right.

2437
01:25:09,270 --> 01:25:11,710
It's nice that it doesn't taste strong.

2438
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:15,810
It tastes really clean and it doesn't taste strong at all.

2439
01:25:16,080 --> 01:25:17,580
- It's totally my style. - Right.

2440
01:25:17,850 --> 01:25:19,949
I usually like Pyongyang naengmyeon.

2441
01:25:19,950 --> 01:25:20,950
Right.

2442
01:25:20,951 --> 01:25:22,789
- I like dishes that taste clean... - Right.

2443
01:25:22,790 --> 01:25:25,320
And distinct with the flavors of the ingredients.

2444
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:28,489
As the sauce isn't that strong,

2445
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:30,529
I felt the genuine taste of the monkfish.

2446
01:25:30,530 --> 01:25:31,530
Right.

2447
01:25:31,531 --> 01:25:33,299
Usually, the sauce is stronger than everything else.

2448
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:34,329
- Right. - Right.

2449
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:35,330
- Right. - It's so good.
- Really? - Gosh.

2450
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:37,769
It was compared with the Pyongyang naengmyeon...

2451
01:25:37,770 --> 01:25:39,070
and I now understand why.

2452
01:25:39,300 --> 01:25:40,899
It feels like you can eat a lot more of this.

2453
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:41,940
Right.

2454
01:25:43,410 --> 01:25:44,740
I like dishes like this too.

2455
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:47,039
Is it here?

2456
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,550
The stamina food, the octopus soup is here.

2457
01:25:50,450 --> 01:25:51,509
It goes in now.

2458
01:25:51,510 --> 01:25:52,649
(It's already the third small octopus today.)

2459
01:25:52,650 --> 01:25:54,319
- Isn't that a giant octopus? - Gosh, look at that!

2460
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:56,360
I've seen this scene in "Pirates of the Caribbean!"

2461
01:25:56,490 --> 01:25:57,519
"Pirates of the Caribbean!"

2462
01:25:57,520 --> 01:25:59,320
The order of the dishes is amazing.

2463
01:25:59,420 --> 01:26:01,119
You would've regretted it if you didn't order this one.

2464
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:02,189
- Right. - If we didn't order this,

2465
01:26:02,190 --> 01:26:03,429
- we would've been in big trouble. - Gosh.

2466
01:26:03,430 --> 01:26:04,459
This one was a must.

2467
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:05,689
- We would've been in big trouble. - Right.

2468
01:26:05,690 --> 01:26:07,799
The small octopus tastes the best...

2469
01:26:07,800 --> 01:26:09,199
when it turns pink.

2470
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,229
- Really? - It's not ready yet.

2471
01:26:10,230 --> 01:26:12,129
- It has to be cooked a bit more. - I see.

2472
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:13,139
He's precise.

2473
01:26:13,140 --> 01:26:15,640
Try the soup before it gets cooked.

2474
01:26:15,900 --> 01:26:17,269
- It smells amazing. - We need more kimchi.

2475
01:26:17,270 --> 01:26:18,310
Thank you.

2476
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:20,310
The soup tastes really refreshing.

2477
01:26:20,780 --> 01:26:21,939
(Slurping)

2478
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:23,750
Can't we have a quiz for this one?

2479
01:26:24,580 --> 01:26:26,450
(Laughing)

2480
01:26:31,120 --> 01:26:32,120
(Amazed)

2481
01:26:32,250 --> 01:26:34,090
- Gosh, it's so nice! - It's nice, isn't it?

2482
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:37,760
It's neat and is 100-percent savory.

2483
01:26:37,860 --> 01:26:40,159
It doesn't feel thick at all.

2484
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:43,629
It has just the sweetness and flavors...

2485
01:26:43,630 --> 01:26:44,930
from the seafood and vegetables.

2486
01:26:45,000 --> 01:26:47,069
It feels very comfortable, doesn't it?

2487
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:49,030
(It's time to try the small octopus in the soup.)

2488
01:26:50,440 --> 01:26:52,910
- Right. - It works for everything.

2489
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:54,510
It doesn't taste too strong.

2490
01:26:58,380 --> 01:26:59,719
Gosh, it smells amazing.

2491
01:26:59,720 --> 01:27:00,750
(Satisfied)

2492
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:02,750
I love the water parsley.

2493
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,196
- How is it? - It's my favorite vegetable.

2494
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:06,489
- Right. - Really?

2495
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:07,890
- You must love its scent. - Right.

2496
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:09,189
It's so refreshing.

2497
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:10,990
I love these kinds of dishes.

2498
01:27:13,030 --> 01:27:14,329
- It was cooked nicely. - It's like squid sundae.

2499
01:27:14,330 --> 01:27:15,876
- It's like squid sundae. - It's like squid sundae.

2500
01:27:15,900 --> 01:27:17,799
- Would you like the head? - I'll have some.

2501
01:27:17,800 --> 01:27:19,199
- Please cut some for me. - Should I cut it for you?

2502
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,740
Dip it inside and burst it open.

2503
01:27:21,570 --> 01:27:23,746
- The innards have cooked nicely. - That looks fine too.

2504
01:27:23,770 --> 01:27:25,940
(What?)

2505
01:27:26,210 --> 01:27:28,010
(Why did Dong Hyun freeze up?)

2506
01:27:28,480 --> 01:27:30,040
- What's wrong? - It does look a bit...

2507
01:27:30,250 --> 01:27:32,310
It does look a bit violent inside.

2508
01:27:32,450 --> 01:27:33,920
That part tastes so good.

2509
01:27:34,050 --> 01:27:35,449
You don't eat that part, do you?

2510
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:36,919
(I should eat it as it's good for the body, right?)

2511
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:39,289
He always sings about having stamina food.

2512
01:27:39,290 --> 01:27:41,019
This part is really good.

2513
01:27:41,020 --> 01:27:42,789
- What is this? - It bursts open.

2514
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:44,189
Try cutting it.

2515
01:27:44,190 --> 01:27:46,630
- Try cutting it with your teeth. - It bursts open like this.

2516
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:49,059
Those are the eggs.

2517
01:27:49,060 --> 01:27:50,630
- The eggs. - They're like rice grains.

2518
01:27:51,030 --> 01:27:52,170
- Rice grains. - Right.

2519
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,769
It's just the same as the eggs from the webfoot octopus.

2520
01:27:56,770 --> 01:27:57,840
The eggs.

2521
01:27:57,940 --> 01:27:59,469
He takes so much care of his body.

2522
01:27:59,470 --> 01:28:00,886
(He takes so much care of his body.)

2523
01:28:00,910 --> 01:28:01,939
- Gosh. - Right.

2524
01:28:01,940 --> 01:28:03,850
He won't eat it if it looks strange.

2525
01:28:04,450 --> 01:28:06,679
He'll eat it if he gets told that it's good.

2526
01:28:06,680 --> 01:28:08,256
- I'll eat it if it's good for me. - Gosh.

2527
01:28:08,280 --> 01:28:09,280
It's good.

2528
01:28:09,281 --> 01:28:11,149
- It's the fried rice! - Gosh!

2529
01:28:11,150 --> 01:28:14,090
- The fried rice is here. - Fried rice?

2530
01:28:14,460 --> 01:28:17,430
(The thing you must never say at a restaurant)

2531
01:28:18,190 --> 01:28:21,060
("You're going to get fried rice too?")

2532
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:23,800
He wrote the character for "luck."

2533
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:25,169
He adds detail to every dish.

2534
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:26,540
He wrote the character.

2535
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:28,540
Gosh, he wrote "luck."

2536
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,110
It smells amazing!

2537
01:28:30,240 --> 01:28:32,539
It was made with the sauce that wasn't too strong.

2538
01:28:32,540 --> 01:28:34,279
- Gosh, it smells great. - Right.

2539
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:35,509
It wasn't even seasoned.

2540
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:37,049
(Amazed)

2541
01:28:37,050 --> 01:28:38,579
The head tastes really good.

2542
01:28:38,580 --> 01:28:40,019
- Gosh, it's nice. - You must have this.

2543
01:28:40,020 --> 01:28:41,719
- This tastes so good. - The head.

2544
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:43,750
Give the head a try.

2545
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:46,720
The fried rice is so good.

2546
01:28:49,690 --> 01:28:51,630
The kimchi fried rice... Gosh.

2547
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:55,059
It tastes so nice with the mixture of the perilla seeds and kimchi.

2548
01:28:55,060 --> 01:28:56,299
- Perilla seeds and kimchi? - The kimchi has to be...

2549
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:57,530
cut up really finely.

2550
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,669
This is something you can eat endlessly...

2551
01:28:59,670 --> 01:29:01,340
no matter how full you are.

2552
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:02,940
It's nice.

2553
01:29:03,870 --> 01:29:06,910
No one can tell this was made with the braised monkfish.

2554
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:09,110
It's a completely new dish.

2555
01:29:09,380 --> 01:29:13,020
The dishes here are really clean,

2556
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:15,479
but they still have a rich flavor.

2557
01:29:15,480 --> 01:29:16,489
Right.

2558
01:29:16,490 --> 01:29:18,296
It would've been a big loss if we didn't have this.

2559
01:29:18,320 --> 01:29:19,920
The fried rice is so good.

2560
01:29:21,460 --> 01:29:24,330
(After having a bite of the fried rice, )

2561
01:29:24,590 --> 01:29:28,760
(he soaks up his mouth with the octopus soup.)

2562
01:29:29,060 --> 01:29:30,969
The scorched rice must taste even better.

2563
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:32,199
He's the Solitary Gourmet.

2564
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,840
(He rinses his mouth with a shot.)

2565
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,340
I barely leave any food.

2566
01:29:35,540 --> 01:29:37,086
I have to eat everything that's in front of me.

2567
01:29:37,110 --> 01:29:39,269
Look at that. It's clean just over there.

2568
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:40,440
(Empty)

2569
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:42,410
Someone has to stop us from eating.

2570
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:46,420
(If that is what you want, )

2571
01:29:46,580 --> 01:29:49,420
(it's only natural to help.)

2572
01:29:50,090 --> 01:29:52,530
(After making a spoonful after scraping off the fried rice, )

2573
01:29:53,960 --> 01:29:57,190
(he gives it to the youngest one.)

2574
01:29:58,530 --> 01:30:01,059
(Seung Ho returns to the pot.)

2575
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:03,470
(He happened to become an accomplice.)

2576
01:30:03,570 --> 01:30:04,769
(From the hands of the young ones, )

2577
01:30:04,770 --> 01:30:06,999
(another spoonful is made.)

2578
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,000
I'm done. I'm completely full,

2579
01:30:09,570 --> 01:30:11,210
but I can't stop myself from eating this.

2580
01:30:11,440 --> 01:30:13,279
We're ready to stop you.

2581
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,680
If you look here, we've prepared the spoonfuls.

2582
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:18,479
We've prepared these to stop you.

2583
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,549
- The eye exam is prepared. - Gosh.

2584
01:30:20,550 --> 01:30:23,019
- Gosh. - They're unstoppable.

2585
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:25,290
This will be given to just one person.

2586
01:30:25,450 --> 01:30:26,620
It will be a generous reward.

2587
01:30:26,790 --> 01:30:27,919
This must be given.

2588
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:29,790
Should we go with the Cute and Small Game too?

2589
01:30:30,030 --> 01:30:31,266
- That sounds good. - That sounds good.

2590
01:30:31,290 --> 01:30:32,690
All right. Who will start?

2591
01:30:32,890 --> 01:30:34,429
- Me? - One, two, three. Like this?

2592
01:30:34,430 --> 01:30:36,359
- Like this? - Like this.

2593
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:37,469
- Sure. - Okay.

2594
01:30:37,470 --> 01:30:38,470
- I'll start. - Right.

2595
01:30:38,471 --> 01:30:39,530
Cute.

2596
01:30:39,740 --> 01:30:41,070
Cute, small.

2597
01:30:41,370 --> 01:30:43,340
Cute, small, bright.

2598
01:30:43,510 --> 01:30:45,870
Cute, small, bright, bright.

2599
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:48,186
Hold on. He shouldn't be allowed to make it sound like Chinese.

2600
01:30:48,210 --> 01:30:50,309
- What? I was just saying it. - That shouldn't be allowed.

2601
01:30:50,310 --> 01:30:52,009
- "Cute, small." Not like that. - You spoke with tones.

2602
01:30:52,010 --> 01:30:53,949
- You did that just now. - I said the word correctly.

2603
01:30:53,950 --> 01:30:55,779
- The tones shouldn't matter. - Where did you stop?

2604
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:56,950
- Bright, right? - Yes.

2605
01:30:57,020 --> 01:30:59,119
Cute, small, bright, bright,

2606
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:00,159
cute.

2607
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:01,160
(They've gone past a full cycle.)

2608
01:31:01,161 --> 01:31:03,859
Cute, small, bright, bright,

2609
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:05,630
cute, small, bright.

2610
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:07,560
You said one more word.

2611
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:09,530
What a fool.

2612
01:31:10,230 --> 01:31:11,930
Why did you say another word?

2613
01:31:12,170 --> 01:31:13,446
- His pronunciation was good. - Gosh.

2614
01:31:13,470 --> 01:31:14,940
- Seung Ho and I are left. - Right.

2615
01:31:15,470 --> 01:31:16,510
Cute.

2616
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:17,970
Cute, small.

2617
01:31:19,510 --> 01:31:21,339
- Great. - What's wrong?

2618
01:31:21,340 --> 01:31:23,250
(Global standard)

2619
01:31:23,510 --> 01:31:25,180
Cute, small, bright.

2620
01:31:25,780 --> 01:31:27,980
Cute, small, bright, bright.

2621
01:31:28,950 --> 01:31:31,250
It feels like they're doing much better that way.

2622
01:31:31,450 --> 01:31:32,589
- It works well. - Gosh!

2623
01:31:32,590 --> 01:31:35,089
Cute, small, bright, bright,

2624
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:36,090
cute.

2625
01:31:37,730 --> 01:31:39,659
Cute, small, bright, bright,

2626
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:41,030
cute, small.

2627
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:44,199
Cute, small, bright, bright,

2628
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:45,570
cute, small, bright.

2629
01:31:45,730 --> 01:31:46,870
- Gosh! - He's good.

2630
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:49,000
Should I go with the Chinese version?

2631
01:31:49,910 --> 01:31:51,739
Cute, small, bright, bright,

2632
01:31:51,740 --> 01:31:53,910
cute, small, bright, bright.

2633
01:31:54,640 --> 01:31:56,579
- What? Why are they so good? - They're good.

2634
01:31:56,580 --> 01:31:58,449
- All right. - Cute, small,

2635
01:31:58,450 --> 01:31:59,979
bright, bright,

2636
01:31:59,980 --> 01:32:02,379
cute, small, bright bright,

2637
01:32:02,380 --> 01:32:03,390
cute.

2638
01:32:04,020 --> 01:32:05,090
Cute...

2639
01:32:06,820 --> 01:32:11,729
(The bell goes off. Yi Kyung takes the win.)

2640
01:32:11,730 --> 01:32:12,989
Without trying the braised monkfish,

2641
01:32:12,990 --> 01:32:14,870
I can taste the sauce from just the fried rice.

2642
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:19,430
(He comforts his heart with the fried rice he won.)

2643
01:32:20,300 --> 01:32:22,939
(Eyes opening wide)

2644
01:32:22,940 --> 01:32:25,670
This is so nice. It doesn't taste strong.

2645
01:32:26,110 --> 01:32:27,910
I'll make you some nurungji.

2646
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:30,450
Nurungji? That's a must.

2647
01:32:30,650 --> 01:32:32,949
We must try this no matter how full we are.

2648
01:32:32,950 --> 01:32:34,050
- Right. - The nurungji.

2649
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:35,579
Here I go.

2650
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:37,219
(He uses the lid of the rice bowl.)

2651
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:39,990
- The nurungji is amazing. - Gosh.

2652
01:32:40,120 --> 01:32:41,490
He has his own skill for this.

2653
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:43,159
- He's using the lid. - He's using the lid.

2654
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:44,189
There.

2655
01:32:44,190 --> 01:32:46,059
- Gosh, it smells so good. - This is cheating.

2656
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:47,620
(The savory nurungji gets scraped off.)

2657
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:52,929
(They all take a bite of the K-Dessert.)

2658
01:32:52,930 --> 01:32:54,490
- You're going to get mad. - It's nice.

2659
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:56,499
It's so crunchy.

2660
01:32:56,500 --> 01:32:57,509
(Looking emotional)

2661
01:32:57,510 --> 01:32:59,116
It must taste so good when it's scraped off like that.

2662
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,339
The rice scorched to the bottom.

2663
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:01,639
It's the Solitary Gourmet.

2664
01:33:01,640 --> 01:33:02,816
- The taste of the perilla oil. - Johnchelin.

2665
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:04,179
- He eats so neatly. - Gosh!

2666
01:33:04,180 --> 01:33:06,280
(Amazed)

2667
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:08,249
- It's slightly burnt. - Right.

2668
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:09,890
- Right. - It has the toasty texture...

2669
01:33:09,990 --> 01:33:11,689
of nurungji.

2670
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:13,860
- Toasty? - The texture is amazing.

2671
01:33:14,020 --> 01:33:17,590
It's pleasantly crispy and sticky.

2672
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:19,489
You're amazing at describing tastes.

2673
01:33:19,490 --> 01:33:21,036
You should describe it differently too.

2674
01:33:21,060 --> 01:33:23,899
When I describe food, I start with the temperature.

2675
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:25,200
"It's hot."

2676
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:27,070
"It's really hot."

2677
01:33:27,170 --> 01:33:29,439
"You might burn your lips as it's too hot."

2678
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,116
- "Cool it down before you eat it." - "Cool it down before you eat it."

2679
01:33:31,140 --> 01:33:32,169
It's 133 dollars.

2680
01:33:32,170 --> 01:33:33,310
- All right. - Great.

2681
01:33:33,410 --> 01:33:35,940
Everything will get decided here including next week's penalty.

2682
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:37,410
Here's the quiz.

2683
01:33:37,680 --> 01:33:42,050
The monkfish was called the demon of the sea in the West...

2684
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:43,850
and was an ingredient that was avoided.

2685
01:33:44,890 --> 01:33:48,619
But this part of the monkfish has a similar texture as lobster...

2686
01:33:48,620 --> 01:33:50,989
and was called the lobster of the poor...

2687
01:33:50,990 --> 01:33:52,859
and got a lot of attention.

2688
01:33:52,860 --> 01:33:54,959
- What is this? - I know this.

2689
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:55,999
"This part of the monkfish."

2690
01:33:56,000 --> 01:33:57,699
It can't be the innards.

2691
01:33:57,700 --> 01:34:00,540
It must be the meat of the monkfish.

2692
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:04,839
Out of the meat of the monkfish,

2693
01:34:04,840 --> 01:34:08,980
the bounciest part must be the most similar to lobster.

2694
01:34:09,080 --> 01:34:10,509
- It's bouncy, but... - The skin...

2695
01:34:10,510 --> 01:34:12,380
has a completely different texture.

2696
01:34:12,610 --> 01:34:14,649
- The tail of the monkfish? - It's the meat of lobster...

2697
01:34:14,650 --> 01:34:16,096
- and the meat of monkfish? - The tail of the monkfish.

2698
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:17,120
- The tail? - The tail.

2699
01:34:17,121 --> 01:34:18,289
What's the texture like of the tail?

2700
01:34:18,290 --> 01:34:20,360
It has the bone and the meat is in between it.

2701
01:34:20,560 --> 01:34:21,819
It's really similar to the meat of lobster.

2702
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:22,890
- Really? - Really?

2703
01:34:23,430 --> 01:34:24,889
What are the parts on the side called?

2704
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:26,059
But that part...

2705
01:34:26,060 --> 01:34:27,100
The fins...

2706
01:34:28,030 --> 01:34:29,699
It could be that part too.

2707
01:34:29,700 --> 01:34:33,739
The meat toward the tail of fish are usually the hardest.

2708
01:34:33,740 --> 01:34:35,099
When a muscle is used a lot,

2709
01:34:35,100 --> 01:34:36,810
it becomes bouncy and lean.

2710
01:34:36,910 --> 01:34:40,780
That is why the meat toward the tail in bouncy.

2711
01:34:41,040 --> 01:34:43,109
Other than the tail,

2712
01:34:43,110 --> 01:34:45,679
(Other than the tail...)

2713
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:46,826
I can't think of any other part.

2714
01:34:46,850 --> 01:34:48,849
You're doing well today. Don't you feel like it's the answer?

2715
01:34:48,850 --> 01:34:49,919
It feels like the answer.

2716
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:51,720
- There are no other parts. - Okay.

2717
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:53,050
We got it.

2718
01:34:53,051 --> 01:34:54,560
The tail of the monkfish.

2719
01:34:54,690 --> 01:34:55,919
The tail of the monkfish.

2720
01:34:55,920 --> 01:35:00,359
(Answer: Tail)

2721
01:35:00,360 --> 01:35:01,460
Correct.

2722
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:03,770
Yes!

2723
01:35:03,970 --> 01:35:06,199
(The bill and makeup all get handed over to this team.)

2724
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,670
We did it!

2725
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,539
That was amazing!

2726
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:11,870
- Dong Hyun! - Gosh!

2727
01:35:12,070 --> 01:35:14,680
- He got it right at once. - Gosh.

2728
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:16,439
Dong Hyun was spot on.

2729
01:35:16,440 --> 01:35:18,679
It's like the oxtail.

2730
01:35:18,680 --> 01:35:19,909
The tail is long...

2731
01:35:19,910 --> 01:35:21,149
and the meat is stuck on it.

2732
01:35:21,150 --> 01:35:22,719
- Right. - We won't be paying this week.

2733
01:35:22,720 --> 01:35:24,720
You and I paid once last week, right?

2734
01:35:24,790 --> 01:35:25,949
- You didn't pay today, right? - I didn't.

2735
01:35:25,950 --> 01:35:27,220
Nice!

2736
01:35:27,660 --> 01:35:29,619
All right. The one to get chosen...

2737
01:35:29,620 --> 01:35:31,390
- will also put on makeup. - Right.

2738
01:35:31,460 --> 01:35:33,599
All three of us paid today.

2739
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:34,700
Right.

2740
01:35:35,400 --> 01:35:36,700
I'll make you feel competitive.

2741
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:38,830
I'll make you feel competitive.

2742
01:35:38,930 --> 01:35:41,800
Competitive!

2743
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:43,199
- Gosh, that must be annoying. - Competitive!

2744
01:35:43,200 --> 01:35:44,809
I'm not sure about being competitive.

2745
01:35:44,810 --> 01:35:46,169
He just dropped down my morale.

2746
01:35:46,170 --> 01:35:47,680
(He just dropped down my morale.)

2747
01:35:48,180 --> 01:35:49,500
Let's get competitive! Good luck!

2748
01:35:49,980 --> 01:35:51,580
- Good luck! - Let's do this!

2749
01:35:51,980 --> 01:35:53,719
- There are two parentheses. - Right.

2750
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:54,779
When these two get answered first,

2751
01:35:54,780 --> 01:35:56,379
the one to pay will get decided.

2752
01:35:56,380 --> 01:35:57,920
This is a famous quote by Plato.

2753
01:35:58,490 --> 01:36:00,290
"A should be considered the least important."

2754
01:36:00,590 --> 01:36:02,190
"Power should be considered moderately."

2755
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:05,030
"And B should be prioritized."

2756
01:36:05,230 --> 01:36:07,730
It's hard to give out guesses with this one.

2757
01:36:08,630 --> 01:36:10,029
Once you start,

2758
01:36:10,030 --> 01:36:11,169
(Your card will be revealed once you open your mouth.)

2759
01:36:11,170 --> 01:36:13,769
it's easier to prune out...

2760
01:36:13,770 --> 01:36:15,839
- the answers. - Right.

2761
01:36:15,840 --> 01:36:17,439
It's hard to make guesses.

2762
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,010
- Power. - This one is too hard.

2763
01:36:19,170 --> 01:36:21,209
- Can I start first? - You should make a lot of guesses.

2764
01:36:21,210 --> 01:36:22,539
We'll each have a turn anyway.

2765
01:36:22,540 --> 01:36:24,450
I'll wait after going first.

2766
01:36:24,910 --> 01:36:26,649
(A least important, B prioritized)

2767
01:36:26,650 --> 01:36:27,750
A...

2768
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:29,980
is money.

2769
01:36:30,120 --> 01:36:31,419
- A is money? - Right.

2770
01:36:31,420 --> 01:36:32,649
That sounds right.

2771
01:36:32,650 --> 01:36:34,359
- That sounds right. - That must be it.

2772
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:35,719
- Correct. - Yes!

2773
01:36:35,720 --> 01:36:39,460
(Seung Ho gets exempted from the bill and penalty with a shout.)

2774
01:36:40,260 --> 01:36:41,300
Gosh!

2775
01:36:41,700 --> 01:36:45,669
(Sang Uk gets hearing issues while sitting next to him.)

2776
01:36:45,670 --> 01:36:46,940
I couldn't hear for a moment.

2777
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:50,410
I got it. B is health.

2778
01:36:50,440 --> 01:36:51,469
B is health?

2779
01:36:51,470 --> 01:36:52,539
I think that's right!

2780
01:36:52,540 --> 01:36:53,579
That's the one that should be prioritized.

2781
01:36:53,580 --> 01:36:54,609
I think that's right!

2782
01:36:54,610 --> 01:36:55,680
That is...

2783
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:57,250
- incorrect. - Gosh.

2784
01:36:57,410 --> 01:36:59,056
- It's your chance! - Is it really "friend?"

2785
01:36:59,080 --> 01:37:00,720
B is friend.

2786
01:37:02,420 --> 01:37:04,690
Friend? There are so many people you can't trust.

2787
01:37:04,850 --> 01:37:06,189
- Incorrect. - Right.

2788
01:37:06,190 --> 01:37:08,060
- I got it. - Right.

2789
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:11,029
- Family. - Family?

2790
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:12,090
Incorrect.

2791
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:13,560
I got it. Happiness.

2792
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:14,999
That is incorrect.

2793
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:16,660
- It's not along those lines. - No?

2794
01:37:17,070 --> 01:37:18,570
Money is the least important.

2795
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:19,600
Money is the least important.

2796
01:37:19,601 --> 01:37:20,669
Power should be considered moderately.

2797
01:37:20,670 --> 01:37:21,699
Power?

2798
01:37:21,700 --> 01:37:23,916
Won't it be important to understand the one who said this?

2799
01:37:23,940 --> 01:37:25,839
- Do you know the answer? - What about Plato?

2800
01:37:25,840 --> 01:37:26,980
Plato?

2801
01:37:27,440 --> 01:37:28,779
I don't know much about him.

2802
01:37:28,780 --> 01:37:31,279
- Please give me another chance. - Hold on.

2803
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:33,819
- Please give me another chance. - Go for it.

2804
01:37:33,820 --> 01:37:34,880
Honor.

2805
01:37:35,420 --> 01:37:36,620
Honor?

2806
01:37:37,750 --> 01:37:38,819
Incorrect.

2807
01:37:38,820 --> 01:37:41,319
(Honor is incorrect.)

2808
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:42,989
- I got it. Knowledge. - Knowledge?

2809
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:44,659
Knowledge can't be prioritized.

2810
01:37:44,660 --> 01:37:46,660
- Power is below that. - Can't that not happen?

2811
01:37:47,060 --> 01:37:48,259
Then only the smart ones...

2812
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:49,729
- Correct. - What?

2813
01:37:49,730 --> 01:37:51,829
(Knowledge should be prioritized.)

2814
01:37:51,830 --> 01:37:54,200
I knew it. People like me are totally off.

2815
01:37:54,940 --> 01:37:56,239
- I was totally off. - Where?

2816
01:37:56,240 --> 01:37:57,309
- He went against you. - Right.

2817
01:37:57,310 --> 01:37:58,840
- It was knowledge? - Right.

2818
01:37:59,110 --> 01:38:00,410
I would've never got it right.

2819
01:38:01,140 --> 01:38:02,479
I would've never got it right.

2820
01:38:02,480 --> 01:38:03,579
Gosh.

2821
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:05,009
I didn't think it was knowledge.

2822
01:38:05,010 --> 01:38:07,680
The ones with knowledge are definitely different.

2823
01:38:08,250 --> 01:38:10,350
- Gosh. - It was knowledge?

2824
01:38:11,050 --> 01:38:13,049
I will put on funny makeup next week.

2825
01:38:13,050 --> 01:38:14,359
As it's the start,

2826
01:38:14,360 --> 01:38:15,890
it won't be that intense, right?

2827
01:38:16,090 --> 01:38:17,459
I'll do this...

2828
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:18,829
- and it will get worse after that. - Okay.

2829
01:38:18,830 --> 01:38:20,630
We'll do it until we end up in our underwear.

2830
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:22,929
I can't wait.

2831
01:38:22,930 --> 01:38:23,930
(That can never happen.)

2832
01:38:24,030 --> 01:38:27,169
Andrew John Park, it's been a while since you revisited our show.

2833
01:38:27,170 --> 01:38:29,039
How was your time in Gyeongdong Market?

2834
01:38:29,040 --> 01:38:30,269
I had a great time.

2835
01:38:30,270 --> 01:38:31,839
I laughed and chatted all day...

2836
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,579
and had great food too.

2837
01:38:33,580 --> 01:38:36,009
I forgot that this was even a shoot.

2838
01:38:36,010 --> 01:38:38,479
We heard a lot of sophisticated descriptions of food too.

2839
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:39,709
- Oh, not at all. - "Toasty."

2840
01:38:39,710 --> 01:38:41,049
Eating shows these days...

2841
01:38:41,050 --> 01:38:42,819
- are all about eating a lot. - Right.

2842
01:38:42,820 --> 01:38:44,489
It has been a while to see a very neat eating show.

2843
01:38:44,490 --> 01:38:47,159
Thank you for making us feel great with your presence.

2844
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:49,120
- I had a great time. Thank you. - Thank you.

2845
01:38:50,020 --> 01:38:51,289
The loser in Gyeongdong Market...

2846
01:38:51,290 --> 01:38:52,859
- is Lee Yi Kyung! - Lee Yi Kyung!

2847
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:55,330
- Thank you! - Thank you!

2848
01:38:57,730 --> 01:39:00,029
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2849
01:39:00,030 --> 01:39:01,399
Please come again.

2850
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:03,570
- I will make sure to. Thank you. - Thank you.

2851
01:39:05,470 --> 01:39:06,980
I'm worried about next week's makeup.

2852
01:39:07,780 --> 01:39:08,910
It has to be funny.

2853
01:39:09,114 --> 01:39:11,223
(Today's Menu Recommendation Spot)

2854
01:39:11,224 --> 01:39:13,153
(Gongneung)

2855
01:39:13,154 --> 01:39:15,693
(He's a champion in the YouTube world.)

2856
01:39:15,694 --> 01:39:18,194
(Someone who went on a trip just with Seung Ho?)

2857
01:39:19,224 --> 01:39:21,063
(The travel creator that goes around the whole world)

2858
01:39:21,064 --> 01:39:23,394
(Travel YouTuber, Pani Bottle)

2859
01:39:23,534 --> 01:39:25,663
(Gongneung, the place where he spent his college days)

2860
01:39:25,664 --> 01:39:28,174
(The area filled with Pani Bottle's youth)

2861
01:39:28,274 --> 01:39:31,143
(The 1st reveal of the restaurant he went to for 20 years...)

2862
01:39:31,144 --> 01:39:35,213
(and other amazing restaurants)

2863
01:39:35,214 --> 01:39:40,043
(With the Handsome Guys that know how to eat, )

2864
01:39:40,044 --> 01:39:42,013
(I am back for a trip down memory lane.)

2865
01:39:42,014 --> 01:39:44,253
(As a professional traveler, )

2866
01:39:44,254 --> 01:39:47,694
(he knows everything about traveling.)

2867
01:39:47,754 --> 01:39:49,753
(Well, that's all he knows about.)

2868
01:39:49,754 --> 01:39:51,423
(Don't tell us you don't know all of us.)

2869
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,793
(I did come...)

2870
01:39:52,794 --> 01:39:54,333
(after looking up someone.)

2871
01:39:54,334 --> 01:39:55,363
(Pani Bottle doesn't know...)

2872
01:39:55,364 --> 01:39:56,893
(Oh Sang Uk.)

2873
01:39:56,894 --> 01:39:58,103
(It's fine.)

2874
01:39:58,104 --> 01:39:59,984
(I thought you were someone else at the start.)

2875
01:40:01,174 --> 01:40:02,533
(Who did this?)

2876
01:40:02,534 --> 01:40:03,603
(Pani Bottle doesn't know...)

2877
01:40:03,604 --> 01:40:04,843
(how to eat.)

2878
01:40:04,844 --> 01:40:06,743
(He said he wanted to get hit by my low kick.)

2879
01:40:06,744 --> 01:40:08,243
(Pani Bottle doesn't know...)

2880
01:40:08,244 --> 01:40:10,584
(how to be moderate.)

2881
01:40:13,214 --> 01:40:15,454
(Laughing)

2882
01:40:15,584 --> 01:40:17,824
(The man that only knows about traveling)

2883
01:40:18,454 --> 01:40:22,794
(Will his trip down memory lane go smoothly?)
