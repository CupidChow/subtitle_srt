You're almost in your 50s.

54

- Toilet. - No, a human weapon.

62
00:02:19,908 --> 00:02:21,577
- Toilet. - I said weapon, not toilet.

63
00:02:21,578 --> 00:02:22,747
No, not a toilet.

64
00:02:22,748 --> 00:02:23,888

181
00:07:00,798 --> 00:07:02,004
(Why is it just the two of us?)

182
00:07:02,028 --> 00:07:03,157
(The pot calling the kettle black)

183
00:07:03,158 --> 00:07:05,078
- Why are you excluding yourself? - Both of you.

184
00:07:05,168 --> 00:07:07,497
- You should eat lunch too. - Are they that bad?

185
00:07:07,498 --> 00:07:10,037
- You need to count yourself too. - Okay? I'm serious.

186
00:07:10,038 --> 00:07:12,867
- Please order food for one person. - Also...

187
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:14,677
Dong Hyun always says,

188
00:07:14,678 --> 00:07:17,377
"You must order three bowls of rice with this no matter what."

189
00:07:17,378 --> 00:07:19,147
I'll control myself too. I'm sorry.

190
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:20,877
- Let's behave with dignity. - Right.

191
00:07:20,878 --> 00:07:22,177
- We should... - Please.

192
00:07:22,178 --> 00:07:23,547
Let's behave with dignity.

193
00:07:23,548 --> 00:07:24,687
Please.

194
00:07:24,688 --> 00:07:26,017
That's what I'd like.

195
00:07:26,018 --> 00:07:27,487
- Where shall we go first? - Yes.

196
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,757
- All right. - I have a good feeling about it.

197
00:07:29,758 --> 00:07:30,958
Your first meal will be...

198
00:07:31,388 --> 00:07:33,557
- pasta and steak. - Exactly. I had a good feeling.

199
00:07:33,558 --> 00:07:35,957
- This is it. - This is the most important.

200
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,357
- It's the most important. - I had a good feeling.

201
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:39,327
After this, being the second team to eat dinner is perfect.

202
00:07:39,328 --> 00:07:40,328
(I didn't eat before coming here.)

203
00:07:40,329 --> 00:07:41,437
I didn't eat before coming here.

204
00:07:41,438 --> 00:07:42,768
You'll eat on the second floor.

205
00:07:43,198 --> 00:07:44,268
Is this the place?

206
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:46,768
- This place with a nice view? - This is the best.

207
00:07:47,638 --> 00:07:49,308
So this is the place.

208
00:07:50,108 --> 00:07:52,478
- That's why it has a nice view. - So this is the place.

209
00:07:54,618 --> 00:07:56,218
I'm so glad that the restaurant is here.

210
00:07:59,148 --> 00:08:01,617
- Everyone is eating steak. - Enjoy your food.

211
00:08:01,618 --> 00:08:03,587
- Enjoy your food. - It must be a famous restaurant.

212
00:08:03,588 --> 00:08:04,687
It must be famous.

213
00:08:04,688 --> 00:08:06,127
- Enjoy your food. - Hello.

214
00:08:06,128 --> 00:08:07,498
The restaurant is packed.

215
00:08:07,728 --> 00:08:08,827
Hello.

216
00:08:08,828 --> 00:08:10,527
- It's because the food is good. - Exactly.

217
00:08:10,528 --> 00:08:11,697
There's a reason why it's famous.

218
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:12,698
(The place is crowded with customers even on the rooftop.)

219
00:08:12,699 --> 00:08:13,798
It's packed here.

220
00:08:15,298 --> 00:08:19,468
(A restaurant surrounded by the green color on Mount Bugak)

221
00:08:21,078 --> 00:08:25,248
(Beyond the glass walls that surround the inside)

222
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:31,648
(Where you can enjoy a panoramic view)

223
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:33,987
(It's a popular place to go on dates.)

224
00:08:33,988 --> 00:08:35,957
(Bugak Skyway, Tasty Rooftop Restaurant)

225
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:38,128
(Buam-dong, Therapeutic Cafe and Restaurant)

226
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:44,828
(A traditional Italian restaurant with a strong foundation)

227
00:08:45,628 --> 00:08:50,298
(LMR 1, pasta and steak)

228
00:08:51,368 --> 00:08:54,537
I like how there's a different view from here.

229
00:08:54,538 --> 00:08:56,677
Dong Hyun and Tae Hyun.

230
00:08:56,678 --> 00:08:58,607
You have to turn around to look.

231
00:08:58,608 --> 00:09:00,507
- However, we can look... - Right.

232
00:09:00,508 --> 00:09:01,918
At the maple tree while eating.

233
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:03,877
It's so lovely.

234
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:04,887
(Both the food and the view will be pleasant.)

235
00:09:04,888 --> 00:09:06,288
- It's so pretty. - It's beautiful.

236
00:09:07,418 --> 00:09:08,858
- He's here. - Hello.

237
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:10,358
- Hello. - Hello.

238
00:09:10,588 --> 00:09:12,527
- Here's the menu. - Thank you.

239
00:09:12,528 --> 00:09:13,887
Two of you know...

240
00:09:13,888 --> 00:09:15,198
a lot about eating.

241
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,618
They know a lot about eating.

242
00:09:17,158 --> 00:09:20,267
The duck breast. Do you know how healthy duck is?

243
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,797
- You want the duck breast? - Yes.

244
00:09:21,798 --> 00:09:23,337
I've never seen duck steak before.

245
00:09:23,338 --> 00:09:25,967
- Duck is very healthy. - One duck breast, please.

246
00:09:25,968 --> 00:09:27,207
Which steak would you like?

247
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,637
My favorite is tenderloin, which is typical.

248
00:09:29,638 --> 00:09:31,378
- Tenderloin steak? - Tenderloin steak.

249
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:34,818
We'll get two tenderloin steak cooked medium rare.

250
00:09:35,148 --> 00:09:36,977
Are you just getting steak without pasta?

251
00:09:36,978 --> 00:09:38,417
- We'll order it too. - You will?

252
00:09:38,418 --> 00:09:42,888
Each of us will get 1 steak and 1 pasta.

253
00:09:43,018 --> 00:09:45,557
- One steak and one pasta for each. - One steak and one pasta for each?

254
00:09:45,558 --> 00:09:46,687
That's for one person.

255
00:09:46,688 --> 00:09:48,698
One steak and one pasta for each of us.

256
00:09:49,158 --> 00:09:51,528
- We're ordering for three people. - Right.

257
00:09:52,168 --> 00:09:53,998
- To each other... - For the pasta...

258
00:09:54,298 --> 00:09:57,267
- Three different types? - How about cream, oil, and tomato?

259
00:09:57,268 --> 00:09:59,107
- What did we discuss a moment ago? - That sounds good.

260
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:00,838
They clearly responded, didn't they?

261
00:10:01,508 --> 00:10:02,508
I mean...

262
00:10:02,678 --> 00:10:03,837
What do people usually order?

263
00:10:03,838 --> 00:10:05,547
What do three men usually order?

264
00:10:05,548 --> 00:10:06,907
They order a pizza, pasta, and steak.

265
00:10:06,908 --> 00:10:08,877
- They share the three dishes. - So they share them.

266
00:10:08,878 --> 00:10:10,617
Have you seen anyone order like them?

267
00:10:10,618 --> 00:10:12,617
- No, it's my 1st time. - It's his 1st time.

268
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:13,788
No way.

269
00:10:13,848 --> 00:10:15,917
- Actually, I like pasta with oil. - Then get it.

270
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:17,287
- Go ahead. - Sang Uk wants pasta with oil.

271
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:19,458
- Aglio e olio? - An order of aglio e olio, please.

272
00:10:20,488 --> 00:10:22,457
- I'd like ragu pasta. - Ragu pasta?

273
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,758
- Ragu sounds good. - Ragu.

274
00:10:24,568 --> 00:10:26,597
We made two orders of pasta.

275
00:10:26,598 --> 00:10:28,867
I'd like beef gorgonzola risotto.

276
00:10:28,868 --> 00:10:29,868
You want beef?

277
00:10:29,869 --> 00:10:33,037
Now, we should also get...

278
00:10:33,038 --> 00:10:35,077
"Also?"

279
00:10:35,078 --> 00:10:36,537
We need...

280
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:38,677
- an order of pizza. - Hey. Pizza would be...

281
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:39,807
That's not right.

282
00:10:39,808 --> 00:10:40,908
Listen, Tae Hyun.

283
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:43,148
I can't stop him because he'll probably finish it.

284
00:10:44,178 --> 00:10:46,088
It's the same as an all-you-can-eat restaurant.

285
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:50,258
For the pizza, shall we ask him...

286
00:10:50,658 --> 00:10:53,287
- to decide? Don't tell us the menu. - A recommendation sounds good.

287
00:10:53,288 --> 00:10:55,857
- Okay. - Please decide based on our order.

288
00:10:55,858 --> 00:10:57,997
Most importantly, can we get three Coke Zero?

289
00:10:57,998 --> 00:10:59,197
Three Coke Zero?

290
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:00,727
- For the beverage... - What's the point of drinking...

291
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,297
Coke Zero while eating so much?

292
00:11:02,298 --> 00:11:03,638
He always drinks Coke Zero.

293
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:07,308
You must eat breakfast and lunch like a king.

294
00:11:07,638 --> 00:11:09,938
Your dinner should be light.

295
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,138
Let's see if you eat a light dinner tonight.

296
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:14,258
He won't eat light for dinner either.

297
00:11:14,578 --> 00:11:16,218
- The food is here. - Is it?

298
00:11:16,478 --> 00:11:19,147
- The food is finally here. - Please let it be pasta first.

299
00:11:19,148 --> 00:11:20,148
I'm hungry.

300
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:21,387
- Nice. - Pasta is served first.

301
00:11:21,388 --> 00:11:24,057
(The pasta is here.)

302
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,387
- Thank you. - Is that ragu pasta?

303
00:11:25,388 --> 00:11:26,527
This is ragu pasta.

304
00:11:26,528 --> 00:11:27,957
Isn't it Bolognese?

305
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:29,357
Yes, it's like Bolognese pasta.

306
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:30,358
(The red appearance attracts attention.)

307
00:11:30,359 --> 00:11:32,127
The aglio e olio looks good.

308
00:11:32,128 --> 00:11:33,527
- It's nice. - It looks delicious.

309
00:11:33,528 --> 00:11:35,137
My goodness.

310
00:11:35,138 --> 00:11:36,498
(Smelling it in a hurry)

311
00:11:36,898 --> 00:11:38,637
More food is coming.

312
00:11:38,638 --> 00:11:39,668
It's here.

313
00:11:40,008 --> 00:11:44,337
- The pizza is huge. - I'm curious about the pizza.

314
00:11:44,338 --> 00:11:45,847
- I'm curious about the pizza. - Please put it here.

315
00:11:45,848 --> 00:11:47,407
I'll serve each of you.

316
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:48,417
(The server recommended the mushroom pizza.)

317
00:11:48,418 --> 00:11:50,378
- Look at that. - Is it a mushroom pizza?

318
00:11:50,678 --> 00:11:52,447
I'd like to know why you recommended it.

319
00:11:52,448 --> 00:11:53,917
It seemed like there weren't enough vegetables.

320
00:11:53,918 --> 00:11:55,058
That's true.

321
00:11:56,158 --> 00:12:00,428
(The dough is spread out thin for the crunchy texture.)

322
00:12:01,258 --> 00:12:03,497
(Topped with golden needle mushroom, button mushroom, )

323
00:12:03,498 --> 00:12:05,698
(king oyster mushroom, and shiitake mushroom)

324
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:12,668
(Mushroom avengers, fungi pizza)

325
00:12:12,808 --> 00:12:13,808
- Thank you. - Excellent choice.

326
00:12:13,809 --> 00:12:14,977
- Thank you. - It does lack vegetables.

327
00:12:14,978 --> 00:12:16,337
- It looks so delicious. - Let's start eating.

328
00:12:16,338 --> 00:12:18,247
- What do you want to start with? - I'll give you some pizza.

329
00:12:18,248 --> 00:12:20,508
- Shall we start with the pizza? - Goodness.

330
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:22,518
The pizza looks...

331
00:12:22,578 --> 00:12:25,187
- I like the thin dough. - Yes, I prefer the thin dough.

332
00:12:25,188 --> 00:12:28,088
There are mushrooms like button mushrooms.

333
00:12:28,118 --> 00:12:29,917
Here you go.

334
00:12:29,918 --> 00:12:32,627
(They're finally about to eat.)

335
00:12:32,628 --> 00:12:34,328
My goodness.

336
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,427
Here it is. Thank you.

337
00:12:36,428 --> 00:12:37,597
- We're in trouble. The duck steak. - The duck is...

338
00:12:37,598 --> 00:12:38,968
- It's for him. - That's for me.

339
00:12:39,398 --> 00:12:40,527
We're in trouble.

340
00:12:40,528 --> 00:12:41,637
Thank you.

341
00:12:41,638 --> 00:12:43,567
- I've never seen duck meat before. - Is this duck?

342
00:12:43,568 --> 00:12:46,608
(Sang Uk sees duck breast for the first time.)

343
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:49,138
The duck is really...

344
00:12:49,738 --> 00:12:51,278
I love dishes like this.

345
00:12:52,108 --> 00:12:54,207
- Thank you. - Gosh, what's this?

346
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,347
This is amazing.

347
00:12:55,348 --> 00:12:57,388
(Tenderloin steak that Yi Kyung and Seung Ho chose)

348
00:12:58,748 --> 00:13:00,017
I can't put everything in the frame.

349
00:13:00,018 --> 00:13:01,158
Usually...

350
00:13:01,688 --> 00:13:03,618
I forgot about the salad.

351
00:13:04,088 --> 00:13:05,457
I'll put it here.

352
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,288
Thank you. The presentation is beautiful.

353
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,997
- Wait. - There's a lot in it.

354
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:11,297
Earlier today,

355
00:13:11,298 --> 00:13:14,497
- you responded with dignity. - What are you doing?

356
00:13:14,498 --> 00:13:15,537
All of you agreed.

357
00:13:15,538 --> 00:13:17,237
- What are you doing? - Listen.

358
00:13:17,238 --> 00:13:18,767
This is one...

359
00:13:18,768 --> 00:13:20,737
of the dating spots that we picked.

360
00:13:20,738 --> 00:13:22,038
(Think of it as our date.)

361
00:13:22,338 --> 00:13:24,907
Who orders this much on a date?

362
00:13:24,908 --> 00:13:25,977
Thank you for the food.

363
00:13:25,978 --> 00:13:28,318
We'll go ahead and try it.

364
00:13:29,278 --> 00:13:31,747
(Cutting meat romantically for their first meal)

365
00:13:31,748 --> 00:13:34,448
(And an elegant bite)

366
00:13:34,658 --> 00:13:36,487
(Humming)

367
00:13:36,488 --> 00:13:37,988
(This is it.)

368
00:13:38,888 --> 00:13:42,798
(First, the tenderloin is flavored with a lot of smoke.)

369
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:47,468
(Second, it's coated with butter and herbs.)

370
00:13:48,038 --> 00:13:52,138
(The tenderloin steak explodes with juice on your first bite.)

371
00:13:52,568 --> 00:13:55,137
(Sumptuous lunch on a spring day)

372
00:13:55,138 --> 00:13:56,377
This is...

373
00:13:56,378 --> 00:13:57,698
(Sumptuous lunch on a spring day)

374
00:13:58,078 --> 00:13:59,848
(Yummy)

375
00:14:00,648 --> 00:14:01,747
- Sang Uk. - Yes?

376
00:14:01,748 --> 00:14:03,318
- Try some of this. - Yes.

377
00:14:03,978 --> 00:14:05,888
(Thank you)

378
00:14:06,288 --> 00:14:09,718
(They're so lovey-dovey.)

379
00:14:10,088 --> 00:14:13,928
(Sang Uk is cutting the duck steak.)

380
00:14:13,988 --> 00:14:15,228
You know what?

381
00:14:15,298 --> 00:14:17,697
Those who like pork belly and pork shoulder would love this.

382
00:14:17,698 --> 00:14:19,378
(Perfect for those who like pork shoulder)

383
00:14:20,028 --> 00:14:22,798
(Plump duck breast)

384
00:14:23,198 --> 00:14:27,238
(When it's grilled with the skin until it becomes crispy)

385
00:14:27,768 --> 00:14:33,248
(The crunchy skin and juicy meat are excellent.)

386
00:14:33,848 --> 00:14:36,917
I taste blueberries in the sauce.

387
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:38,117
(I taste blueberries in the sauce.)

388
00:14:38,118 --> 00:14:40,288
The sauce is flavored with fruit.

389
00:14:41,818 --> 00:14:43,787
- You're right. - Blueberries?

390
00:14:43,788 --> 00:14:46,188
(The refreshing sauce is made with raspberries.)

391
00:14:46,288 --> 00:14:49,127
- I never saw duck cooked like this. - I've never seen duck steak.

392
00:14:49,128 --> 00:14:50,358
I want to eat this.

393
00:14:51,228 --> 00:14:52,498
Please leave me a bite.

394
00:14:52,598 --> 00:14:53,797
- Okay. - Just one bite.

395
00:14:53,798 --> 00:14:54,967
I'll leave this piece.

396
00:14:54,968 --> 00:14:56,537
It's good with the skin.

397
00:14:56,538 --> 00:14:57,797
Yes, with the skin.

398
00:14:57,798 --> 00:14:58,938
I want to try this.

399
00:14:59,408 --> 00:15:00,808
- It looks delicious. - It's good.

400
00:15:01,838 --> 00:15:03,507
I'm very curious about this.

401
00:15:03,508 --> 00:15:05,207
It's my first time seeing it.

402
00:15:05,208 --> 00:15:06,347
The potato...

403
00:15:06,348 --> 00:15:08,048
(Food that caught Tae Hyun's eye)

404
00:15:08,618 --> 00:15:10,747
(The tenderloin steak)

405
00:15:10,748 --> 00:15:14,858
(What's the food next to the tenderloin steak?)

406
00:15:15,418 --> 00:15:20,188
(A mille-feuille of potatoes, dauphinoise potatoes)

407
00:15:21,498 --> 00:15:23,058
Look at the honey dripping.

408
00:15:23,628 --> 00:15:24,967
- It's honey. - There's honey?

409
00:15:24,968 --> 00:15:26,697
- It's honey. - Gosh, that's great.

410
00:15:26,698 --> 00:15:28,698
(Savory grilled potatoes coated with sweet honey)

411
00:15:29,138 --> 00:15:30,397
Is it like a crepe?

412
00:15:30,398 --> 00:15:32,438
(Eating dauphinoise potatoes for the first time)

413
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:33,868
This is amazing.

414
00:15:34,238 --> 00:15:37,178
It's made of thin layers.

415
00:15:37,838 --> 00:15:40,208
The potatoes spread out on the palate from left to right.

416
00:15:40,748 --> 00:15:41,847
This is really good.

417
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:43,277
- I want to try that. - This is amazing.

418
00:15:43,278 --> 00:15:44,988
Can I get a bite of this?

419
00:15:45,348 --> 00:15:46,687
Then I'll cut...

420
00:15:46,688 --> 00:15:49,087
- some for you. - Half of it.

421
00:15:49,088 --> 00:15:50,334
(The client's wish is registered.)

422
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:51,387
Like this.

423
00:15:51,388 --> 00:15:53,527
- This looks great. - You cut it well.

424
00:15:53,528 --> 00:15:54,698
(Food for the freeloaders)

425
00:15:55,098 --> 00:15:59,598
(After leaving some for the others, Seung Ho takes a bite.)

426
00:16:00,398 --> 00:16:02,544
The potatoes spread out on the palate from left to right.

427
00:16:02,568 --> 00:16:03,967
Dong Hyun.

428
00:16:03,968 --> 00:16:06,307
- Forget about it. I'll just eat it. - Oh, come on.

429
00:16:06,308 --> 00:16:07,937
- It's really good. - It is.

430
00:16:07,938 --> 00:16:09,438
I can tell.

431
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,347
- Dong Hyun. - Sang Uk, hurry...

432
00:16:11,348 --> 00:16:12,808
and try your aglio e olio.

433
00:16:13,008 --> 00:16:14,808
- Aglio e olio? - The noodles will get soggy.

434
00:16:15,218 --> 00:16:17,818
I like aglio e olio too.

435
00:16:18,288 --> 00:16:20,018
- Later... - It looks delicious.

436
00:16:20,788 --> 00:16:22,887
This looks good. I want a bite of this.

437
00:16:22,888 --> 00:16:24,517
(He changes his mind for the third time.)

438
00:16:24,518 --> 00:16:25,558
A bite of this.

439
00:16:25,858 --> 00:16:26,987
(As earnest as Dong Hyun)

440
00:16:26,988 --> 00:16:28,297
This is really good.

441
00:16:28,298 --> 00:16:30,338
(He wraps the fork with as much pasta as possible.)

442
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:34,198
(Taking a big bite)

443
00:16:34,798 --> 00:16:37,067
(This is so good.)

444
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:38,168
This is so good.

445
00:16:38,968 --> 00:16:41,477
(An assembly of garlic including sliced garlic, )

446
00:16:41,478 --> 00:16:44,008
(garlic stems, and crushed garlic)

447
00:16:44,848 --> 00:16:49,578
(Stir-fried enough for the garlic flavor and oil to be absorbed)

448
00:16:50,618 --> 00:16:57,158
(Golden and glossy aglio e olio spaghetti)

449
00:16:58,088 --> 00:17:00,857
It looked classy when you twirled the pasta with a spoon.

450
00:17:00,858 --> 00:17:03,127
(Devouring after twirling it with class)

451
00:17:03,128 --> 00:17:04,358
It looks delicious too.

452
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:08,238
You eat so elegantly.

453
00:17:09,398 --> 00:17:12,707
(This is driving me crazy.)

454
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:13,808
Aglio e olio.

455
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:16,208
The aglio e olio is very good.

456
00:17:16,408 --> 00:17:17,977
Yes, it looks like it.

457
00:17:17,978 --> 00:17:19,648
(Yi Kyung also devours it like others.)

458
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:23,848
The noodles are thinner than the usual aglio e olio.

459
00:17:24,988 --> 00:17:27,588
They're moist and flavored.

460
00:17:27,718 --> 00:17:30,917
When the noodles are thick, they don't mix well in the oil.

461
00:17:30,918 --> 00:17:32,728
- So that's why. - Yes.

462
00:17:33,658 --> 00:17:38,798
(Ragu pasta is the typical pasta with thick sauce.)

463
00:17:39,768 --> 00:17:41,297
I like thick sauces like this.

464
00:17:41,298 --> 00:17:45,768
(Yi Kyung's favorite thick ragu pasta is...)

465
00:17:46,908 --> 00:17:50,538
(Made with tomatoes and ground beef)

466
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:56,018
(A meat sauce from Bologna)

467
00:17:56,618 --> 00:18:01,688
(It's made with linguini that's thicker than normal pasta.)

468
00:18:01,988 --> 00:18:03,657
The noodles are quite thick.

469
00:18:03,658 --> 00:18:04,887
The noodles are thick,

470
00:18:04,888 --> 00:18:06,758
and the meat has a nice texture.

471
00:18:06,988 --> 00:18:09,698
The sauce is thick, and it's made with tomatoes.

472
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:13,627
They look like udon noodles.

473
00:18:13,628 --> 00:18:15,798
- It looks delicious. - They make excellent pasta.

474
00:18:17,238 --> 00:18:18,438
- Sang Uk. - Yes?

475
00:18:18,538 --> 00:18:19,907
Try some of this.

476
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:21,137
(Quickly recommending what's good)

477
00:18:21,138 --> 00:18:22,337
I'll serve you elegantly.

478
00:18:22,338 --> 00:18:23,778
(I'll serve you elegantly.)

479
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,147
- That's the real stuff. - I'll serve you elegantly.

480
00:18:26,148 --> 00:18:27,407
(It's their style to share good food with each other.)

481
00:18:27,408 --> 00:18:29,247
- Try this. - I'm so hungry.

482
00:18:29,248 --> 00:18:30,418
It smells...

483
00:18:30,848 --> 00:18:32,417
- Isn't it insane? - It smells so good.

484
00:18:32,418 --> 00:18:34,347
- Yes. - Do I know this smell?

485
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:36,417
(How does it smell?)

486
00:18:36,418 --> 00:18:38,087
- This is good. - You don't know this smell.

487
00:18:38,088 --> 00:18:39,727
It's a smell that you're curious about.

488
00:18:39,728 --> 00:18:41,497
It smells like pasta...

489
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:43,627
that I had after my match.

490
00:18:43,628 --> 00:18:45,604
(His body remembers the smell of pasta from that day.)

491
00:18:45,628 --> 00:18:46,867
This is the best.

492
00:18:46,868 --> 00:18:51,067
(Sang Uk is chomping Dong Hyun's memory.)

493
00:18:51,068 --> 00:18:53,008
In my opinion, with the pizza...

494
00:18:53,068 --> 00:18:54,568
(Humming)

495
00:18:57,878 --> 00:19:04,378
(The sight of them in love with pasta)

496
00:19:04,988 --> 00:19:06,417
Gosh, I'm hungry.

497
00:19:06,418 --> 00:19:07,918
(Slurping)

498
00:19:08,118 --> 00:19:09,518
Shall we do the quiz now?

499
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:11,087
- I think it's time. - Hasn't it been long?

500
00:19:11,088 --> 00:19:12,728
The food is disappearing.

501
00:19:13,328 --> 00:19:14,898
They finished this one.

502
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,697
I couldn't finish all of it.

503
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,328
This one is for the muscles.

504
00:19:18,928 --> 00:19:20,728
(Upset)

505
00:19:21,428 --> 00:19:23,444
You promised to give me some, but did you finish it?

506
00:19:23,468 --> 00:19:24,567
I ate it.

507
00:19:24,568 --> 00:19:26,407
- You promised to give me some. - Goodness.

508
00:19:26,408 --> 00:19:28,137
You promised to give me some.

509
00:19:28,138 --> 00:19:29,437
- I forgot. - You mean, the duck?

510
00:19:29,438 --> 00:19:30,637
- The duck? - Yes.

511
00:19:30,638 --> 00:19:32,478
- There's a piece left. - He promised...

512
00:19:32,608 --> 00:19:35,218
to give me the tasty part.

513
00:19:35,778 --> 00:19:38,847
Dong Hyun, you should make a wrap...

514
00:19:38,848 --> 00:19:42,517
with some duck and other things on a pizza.

515
00:19:42,518 --> 00:19:44,757
- Put some duck on it. - It's not salty.

516
00:19:44,758 --> 00:19:46,128
I want to eat them separately.

517
00:19:46,258 --> 00:19:47,327
That could be regretful.

518
00:19:47,328 --> 00:19:50,598
In western food, each dish has a different flavor.

519
00:19:50,928 --> 00:19:53,897
Even if you take a big bite, it would be a waste.

520
00:19:53,898 --> 00:19:55,614
If you had to choose one, which would it be?

521
00:19:55,638 --> 00:19:58,608
I'd pick either the potatoes or the aglio e olio.

522
00:19:58,968 --> 00:20:01,367
- I'd add this to it. - You would?

523
00:20:01,368 --> 00:20:03,837
- Weren't you against mixing? - For these...

524
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,677
- Do you have to mix them? - Yes.

525
00:20:05,678 --> 00:20:07,648
I can separate them in my mouth.

526
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:10,277
These will be worth mixing.

527
00:20:10,278 --> 00:20:11,617
While eating aglio e olio,

528
00:20:11,618 --> 00:20:14,017
I'll taste the duck steak first.

529
00:20:14,018 --> 00:20:15,018
After swallowing it,

530
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:16,787
I'll be able to taste the aglio e olio by itself.

531
00:20:16,788 --> 00:20:18,228
All three dishes at once?

532
00:20:19,188 --> 00:20:20,188
Let's get started.

533
00:20:20,189 --> 00:20:22,004
(It's finally time for the quiz for the freeloaders.)

534
00:20:22,028 --> 00:20:24,928
This is a famous quote by Poet William Blake.

535
00:20:25,598 --> 00:20:26,728
I like famous quotes.

536
00:20:27,068 --> 00:20:30,398
"The bird a nest."

537
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:32,567
"The spider a web."

538
00:20:32,568 --> 00:20:33,707
A web.

539
00:20:33,708 --> 00:20:36,508
What does the man have?

540
00:20:36,838 --> 00:20:38,407
- I got it. - "The spider a web."

541
00:20:38,408 --> 00:20:39,778
- Kim Dong Hyun. - I got it.

542
00:20:40,882 --> 00:20:42,482
"The bird a nest."

543
00:20:43,182 --> 00:20:45,082
- "The spider a web." - "The spider a web."

544
00:20:45,482 --> 00:20:46,681
They're both shelters.

545
00:20:46,682 --> 00:20:47,721
(Both the nest and the web are shelters.)

546
00:20:47,722 --> 00:20:48,952
The man has...

547
00:20:49,252 --> 00:20:50,551
companions.

548
00:20:50,552 --> 00:20:51,821
- Companions. Yes. - Companions?

549
00:20:51,822 --> 00:20:53,392
- The man has companions? - Friends.

550
00:20:53,492 --> 00:20:54,838
- They're the same. - My answer is friends.

551
00:20:54,862 --> 00:20:55,862
Incorrect.

552
00:20:55,962 --> 00:20:57,402
- My answer is friends. - Incorrect.

553
00:20:57,562 --> 00:20:58,908
- Is that incorrect? - Companions.

554
00:20:58,932 --> 00:21:01,132
- Friends. - Those are both close.

555
00:21:01,672 --> 00:21:03,071
- Friends. - It's close to friends.

556
00:21:03,072 --> 00:21:04,302
- Why... - It's not family.

557
00:21:04,802 --> 00:21:06,071
What's there between friends?

558
00:21:06,072 --> 00:21:08,472
(It's something that's between friends.)

559
00:21:08,672 --> 00:21:09,672
- Between friends... - I got it.

560
00:21:09,673 --> 00:21:10,942
- I got it. - Affection?

561
00:21:11,342 --> 00:21:12,342
- Affection? - I got it.

562
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:13,711
- There's affection. - I got it.

563
00:21:13,712 --> 00:21:14,742
Incorrect.

564
00:21:15,412 --> 00:21:17,311
There is friendship.

565
00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:18,781
(Answer: Friendship)

566
00:21:18,782 --> 00:21:20,582
- There's friendship. - "Friendship?"

567
00:21:21,122 --> 00:21:23,052
There's friendship between friends.

568
00:21:23,352 --> 00:21:24,352
Correct.

569
00:21:25,562 --> 00:21:28,432
(We have friendship.)

570
00:21:28,832 --> 00:21:29,961
(Fluttering of his heart at this moment is the best.)

571
00:21:29,962 --> 00:21:31,061
What would you like some of?

572
00:21:31,062 --> 00:21:33,501
How can I eat all of this?

573
00:21:33,502 --> 00:21:35,172
(A happy thought)

574
00:21:36,332 --> 00:21:37,332
- This... - You can only take one bite.

575
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:38,342
I know.

576
00:21:38,542 --> 00:21:39,672
Won't you add some duck?

577
00:21:40,102 --> 00:21:41,142
Of course I will.

578
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:43,112
- You want some? - Add a bite of each.

579
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:44,941
- Add that too. - I think...

580
00:21:44,942 --> 00:21:46,011
I'm so hungry.

581
00:21:46,012 --> 00:21:47,112
I'll just eat this.

582
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:49,352
I'm so hungry. Please put it on.

583
00:21:49,482 --> 00:21:50,482
All right.

584
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:52,051
(Putting the duck carefully)

585
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:53,552
What about some garlic?

586
00:21:53,752 --> 00:21:55,092
Definitely.

587
00:21:55,192 --> 00:21:57,351
- How about some potatoes? - No.

588
00:21:57,352 --> 00:21:59,062
- You don't want ragu pasta? - No.

589
00:21:59,292 --> 00:22:00,861
- I don't need any. - You don't want some Coke?

590
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:02,562
No, I don't want any Coke.

591
00:22:02,832 --> 00:22:04,992
- You don't want any of this? - No.

592
00:22:07,132 --> 00:22:09,032
- Here I go. - Take only one bite.

593
00:22:09,132 --> 00:22:11,102
What you dropped looks so good.

594
00:22:15,372 --> 00:22:16,372
He got it.

595
00:22:19,112 --> 00:22:20,181
That's happiness.

596
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:23,411
(He's chewing happiness.)

597
00:22:23,412 --> 00:22:24,812
Hurry and separate the two.

598
00:22:25,122 --> 00:22:26,252
Savor them separately.

599
00:22:26,382 --> 00:22:27,852
(The duck on this side)

600
00:22:29,022 --> 00:22:31,492
He's genuinely savoring it with his eyes closed.

601
00:22:33,792 --> 00:22:35,261
(Enjoying the aglio e olio)

602
00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:36,562
(Enjoying the duck steak)

603
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:37,932
Can you taste the duck?

604
00:22:38,602 --> 00:22:39,831
I'm chewing the duck now.

605
00:22:39,832 --> 00:22:41,362
(He's chewing the duck.)

606
00:22:41,632 --> 00:22:42,632
It's delicious.

607
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:44,131
(I can taste the duck that's crunchy outside and moist inside.)

608
00:22:44,132 --> 00:22:45,272
The duck is delicious.

609
00:22:46,242 --> 00:22:48,371
Like well cooked pork shoulder,

610
00:22:48,372 --> 00:22:49,742
- it's very juicy. - Right?

611
00:22:50,212 --> 00:22:51,512
And it's crunchy outside.

612
00:22:52,612 --> 00:22:53,911
(The duck is good, but...)

613
00:22:53,912 --> 00:22:55,611
This aglio e olio is incredible.

614
00:22:55,612 --> 00:22:56,652
Isn't it good?

615
00:22:57,912 --> 00:23:00,152
Hey, all the food is gone.

616
00:23:00,382 --> 00:23:01,382
We ate it all.

617
00:23:01,682 --> 00:23:07,062
(Clean, clean, 2 pieces, 1 spoonful, clean, clean, clean)

618
00:23:07,262 --> 00:23:09,161
- We finished everything. - We ate it all.

619
00:23:09,162 --> 00:23:10,632
There's only one bite of each.

620
00:23:10,732 --> 00:23:13,202
How could they not eat it at all?

621
00:23:13,262 --> 00:23:14,262
We made up our mind.

622
00:23:14,263 --> 00:23:15,831
- We'll eat it. - They didn't even touch it.

623
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:17,631
- We'll eat it now. - We'll eat it.

624
00:23:17,632 --> 00:23:18,802
This is incredible.

625
00:23:19,502 --> 00:23:20,571
Goodness.

626
00:23:20,572 --> 00:23:21,948
- Thank you. - It's more than I expected.

627
00:23:21,972 --> 00:23:22,972
It's here.

628
00:23:22,973 --> 00:23:24,072
We have the bill.

629
00:23:24,342 --> 00:23:26,342
It's the most expensive lunch we ever had.

630
00:23:27,012 --> 00:23:28,182
It's 311 dollars.

631
00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:29,752
- That's expensive. - Right.

632
00:23:30,012 --> 00:23:31,932
Starting next time, eat breakfast before coming.

633
00:23:32,052 --> 00:23:33,622
This is interesting.

634
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:37,491
We had a classy lunch date.

635
00:23:37,492 --> 00:23:39,591
(They ate all 9 dishes...)

636
00:23:39,592 --> 00:23:41,522
(during their classy date with western food.)

637
00:23:42,032 --> 00:23:43,291
I feel confident about the quiz today.

638
00:23:43,292 --> 00:23:44,662
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

639
00:23:44,892 --> 00:23:46,061
Most people drink wine...

640
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:47,661
with steak and pasta.

641
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:50,301
Sommeliers recommend and serve wine.

642
00:23:50,302 --> 00:23:52,241
- Sommeliers? - They also existed...

643
00:23:52,242 --> 00:23:54,048
- during the Middle Ages. - Middle Ages? Okay.

644
00:23:54,072 --> 00:23:55,912
- Middle Ages. - During the Middle Ages,

645
00:23:56,212 --> 00:23:58,271
not only were they in charge of wines,

646
00:23:58,272 --> 00:24:00,488
but they were also in charge of setting tables, desserts,

647
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,982
desserts, and even this.

648
00:24:03,412 --> 00:24:04,481
What was it?

649
00:24:04,482 --> 00:24:05,981
- This is too difficult. - It's hard.

650
00:24:05,982 --> 00:24:07,082
The range is too wide.

651
00:24:07,352 --> 00:24:09,151
They had many possible tasks, so you're in trouble.

652
00:24:09,152 --> 00:24:10,152
- It's way too wide. - I agree.
- The range is too wide. - They had so many possible tasks.

653
00:24:11,153 --> 00:24:12,161
Thousands of tasks.

654
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:13,362
They had to arrange the shoes.

655
00:24:14,892 --> 00:24:16,831
During the Middle Ages, they had to fight in the war.

656
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:18,308
- Right. - They had to join the battle.

657
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,332
- They had to sharpen the knives. - Exactly.

658
00:24:20,662 --> 00:24:21,801
(There were so many tasks.)

659
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:23,171
They also had to wash the dishes.

660
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:24,532
Washing the dishes.

661
00:24:24,802 --> 00:24:27,001
He said "even this."

662
00:24:27,002 --> 00:24:28,371
It must be an unexpected task.

663
00:24:28,372 --> 00:24:29,671
Did they feed the customers?

664
00:24:29,672 --> 00:24:31,312
Feed them?

665
00:24:31,412 --> 00:24:32,641
"Open your mouth."

666
00:24:32,642 --> 00:24:34,142
(Kindly delivering to the mouth)

667
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:36,151
"Open your mouth."

668
00:24:36,152 --> 00:24:37,412
"Open your mouth wider."

669
00:24:37,552 --> 00:24:39,521
After tasting the food first,

670
00:24:39,522 --> 00:24:40,921
- he said, "It's safe to eat." - Sommeliers...

671
00:24:40,922 --> 00:24:43,721
(After tasting the food first?)

672
00:24:43,722 --> 00:24:44,792
The food taster?

673
00:24:45,322 --> 00:24:47,068
- The food taster. - Did they taste the food first?

674
00:24:47,092 --> 00:24:48,192
Could that be the answer?

675
00:24:48,992 --> 00:24:51,562
Shouldn't they stick to being a sommelier?

676
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:54,961
They could have tasted the food to see...

677
00:24:54,962 --> 00:24:56,532
if it was rotten or not.

678
00:24:57,232 --> 00:24:58,272
Washing the dishes.

679
00:24:59,202 --> 00:25:00,848
- "Washing the dishes?" - I don't think so.

680
00:25:00,872 --> 00:25:02,392
Did they take the customers back home?

681
00:25:02,472 --> 00:25:04,041
As a chauffeur?

682
00:25:04,042 --> 00:25:05,141
(Chauffeurs in the Middle Ages)

683
00:25:05,142 --> 00:25:06,981
- They worked as a chauffeur? - That's a good idea.

684
00:25:06,982 --> 00:25:08,811
The customers drank wine.

685
00:25:08,812 --> 00:25:10,281
- They drove the carriage for them. - They drove the carriage.

686
00:25:10,282 --> 00:25:11,602
They drove the carriage for them.

687
00:25:11,752 --> 00:25:14,452
A long time ago, I got a question about the Middle Ages.

688
00:25:14,782 --> 00:25:16,651
In the Middle Ages, it was about life and death.

689
00:25:16,652 --> 00:25:17,852
He guessed "armor" correctly.

690
00:25:18,352 --> 00:25:20,161
There were wars...

691
00:25:20,162 --> 00:25:21,891
during the Middle Ages.

692
00:25:21,892 --> 00:25:23,091
The food rotted often.

693
00:25:23,092 --> 00:25:24,992
So they tasted the food first.

694
00:25:25,362 --> 00:25:27,922
Hospitals didn't exist back then, so rotten food could kill you.

695
00:25:28,162 --> 00:25:29,772
You could get contaminated easily.

696
00:25:30,402 --> 00:25:34,172
(He's saying that sommeliers tasted food for the customers.)

697
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:36,871
"This isn't good."

698
00:25:36,872 --> 00:25:38,071
- "The food is spoiled." - He's hooked on it.

699
00:25:38,072 --> 00:25:39,441
- "Bring another dish." - When he gets hooked...

700
00:25:39,442 --> 00:25:40,658
on one answer, he can't change his mind.

701
00:25:40,682 --> 00:25:42,381
Then let's narrow down the answer.

702
00:25:42,382 --> 00:25:43,612
We should narrow it down.

703
00:25:44,112 --> 00:25:45,951
Cooking, billing...

704
00:25:45,952 --> 00:25:47,981
(Narrowing down the guesses)

705
00:25:47,982 --> 00:25:50,222
Did you include what I said?

706
00:25:50,452 --> 00:25:51,898
- We have three guesses. - Isn't this right?

707
00:25:51,922 --> 00:25:53,021
We need to come up with more.

708
00:25:53,022 --> 00:25:54,222
I don't think this is correct.

709
00:25:54,422 --> 00:25:55,432
Yi Kyung.

710
00:25:55,692 --> 00:25:57,932
Hello? You cut the small octopus?

711
00:25:58,492 --> 00:26:00,261
They cut the small octopus.

712
00:26:00,262 --> 00:26:01,831
- They did? - It's moving less and less?

713
00:26:01,832 --> 00:26:02,931
Okay, we'll be there soon.

714
00:26:02,932 --> 00:26:04,171
(Bringing up an urgent problem with small octopus)

715
00:26:04,172 --> 00:26:05,172
Listen.

716
00:26:05,173 --> 00:26:07,171
The small octopus is...

717
00:26:07,172 --> 00:26:08,741
getting less active. Please hurry.

718
00:26:08,742 --> 00:26:10,171
(Please proceed quickly. The small octopus is at stake.)

719
00:26:10,172 --> 00:26:11,441
I can't think.

720
00:26:11,442 --> 00:26:13,081
There must be an idea...

721
00:26:13,082 --> 00:26:14,681
- that hits us. - Tangtangi.

722
00:26:14,682 --> 00:26:15,682
- Tangtangi. - Tangtangi.

723
00:26:15,683 --> 00:26:17,782
- When it hits, it's tangtangi. - Tangtangi.

724
00:26:17,952 --> 00:26:20,651
- Tang. - Tang.

725
00:26:20,652 --> 00:26:22,451
- Tangtang? - Two of them were standing...

726
00:26:22,452 --> 00:26:26,092
on either of my side and promised to behave with dignity.

727
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:27,692
Dignity, my foot.

728
00:26:28,362 --> 00:26:31,432
(But it's so much fun.)

729
00:26:31,762 --> 00:26:33,401
- How about this? - This is impossible.

730
00:26:33,402 --> 00:26:34,931
(How about selecting music?)

731
00:26:34,932 --> 00:26:35,932
To create an atmosphere.

732
00:26:36,032 --> 00:26:37,948
- For example, they played music. - It's missing.

733
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:39,342
- Yes. - Right.

734
00:26:39,402 --> 00:26:40,741
I heard that...

735
00:26:40,742 --> 00:26:41,971
piano schools were prevalent for the sommeliers.

736
00:26:41,972 --> 00:26:43,711
Could you repeat the question?

737
00:26:43,712 --> 00:26:45,811
Piano schools were prevalent.

738
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:47,241
(The two elders are excited again.)

739
00:26:47,242 --> 00:26:48,781
Czerny 30.

740
00:26:48,782 --> 00:26:49,782
(Laughing)

741
00:26:50,252 --> 00:26:52,181
(Making piano sounds)

742
00:26:52,182 --> 00:26:54,722
(Singing)

743
00:26:54,952 --> 00:26:56,751
Most people drink wine...

744
00:26:56,752 --> 00:26:57,891
with steak and pasta.

745
00:26:57,892 --> 00:26:59,491
Let us listen...

746
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,321
- to the question. - I mean...

747
00:27:01,322 --> 00:27:02,531
Let us listen to the question.

748
00:27:02,532 --> 00:27:04,091
What's wrong with you two elders?

749
00:27:04,092 --> 00:27:05,438
(They can't control their excitement.)

750
00:27:05,462 --> 00:27:06,801
I remember back then...

751
00:27:06,802 --> 00:27:09,502
playing the piano was taught at sommelier schools.

752
00:27:09,772 --> 00:27:11,172
Piano lessons for the sommeliers.

753
00:27:11,602 --> 00:27:13,501
Music can't kill anyone,

754
00:27:13,502 --> 00:27:16,171
but you can get sick and die from eating.

755
00:27:16,172 --> 00:27:17,841
- Then how about this? - It's about life and death.

756
00:27:17,842 --> 00:27:19,342
Each of us will answer.

757
00:27:19,542 --> 00:27:20,641
If one of us is correct,

758
00:27:20,642 --> 00:27:21,881
he'll be excluded from the individual game.

759
00:27:21,882 --> 00:27:22,911
- Okay. - That sounds good.

760
00:27:22,912 --> 00:27:24,281
- I'm in. - Each of you will answer?

761
00:27:24,282 --> 00:27:26,882
- But you must agree... - We'll agree on your answer.

762
00:27:27,122 --> 00:27:28,482
He's so confident about it.

763
00:27:28,522 --> 00:27:30,122
Okay, Sang Uk's guess is food tasting.

764
00:27:30,222 --> 00:27:31,892
- Yours is music. - Selecting music.

765
00:27:32,022 --> 00:27:33,192
(And mine is...)

766
00:27:33,992 --> 00:27:35,262
The small octopus... Goodness.

767
00:27:35,832 --> 00:27:37,761
The small octopus died, so they put it in the soup.

768
00:27:37,762 --> 00:27:40,661
(The small octopus died, so they put it in the soup.)

769
00:27:40,662 --> 00:27:42,501
Could you hurry up?

770
00:27:42,502 --> 00:27:43,631
- Dong Hyun. - Your guess is...

771
00:27:43,632 --> 00:27:45,542
- Please proceed quickly. - Food tasting.

772
00:27:45,742 --> 00:27:47,971
- I'll go with cooking. - Cooking? They even cooked.

773
00:27:47,972 --> 00:27:49,011
What's the answer?

774
00:27:49,012 --> 00:27:50,042
You say it.

775
00:27:50,142 --> 00:27:51,641
- I got it. - What's the answer?

776
00:27:51,642 --> 00:27:52,742
Food tasting.

777
00:27:53,142 --> 00:27:54,212
Tasting the food...

778
00:27:54,342 --> 00:27:56,252
to see if it's poisoned or spoiled.

779
00:27:56,912 --> 00:27:59,222
- What if it's correct? - That's impossible.

780
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:01,881
They acted as food tasters.

781
00:28:01,882 --> 00:28:02,921
Yes.

782
00:28:02,922 --> 00:28:04,591
(Will Sang Uk's answer be correct?)

783
00:28:04,592 --> 00:28:05,621
Correct.

784
00:28:05,622 --> 00:28:08,792
(Answer: Food tasting)

785
00:28:08,962 --> 00:28:09,962
Correct.

786
00:28:10,292 --> 00:28:12,032
(What?)

787
00:28:12,302 --> 00:28:13,302
Sang Uk.

788
00:28:13,932 --> 00:28:15,871
- What? - It was about life and death.

789
00:28:15,872 --> 00:28:18,031
- Seriously. - By the way...

790
00:28:18,032 --> 00:28:19,271
(They gained victory despite all hindrance.)

791
00:28:19,272 --> 00:28:20,771
I trusted you until the end.

792
00:28:20,772 --> 00:28:22,001
It's a miracle.

793
00:28:22,002 --> 00:28:23,112
That's incredible.

794
00:28:23,172 --> 00:28:24,741
It serves them right.

795
00:28:24,742 --> 00:28:26,058
(Being blind as a bate, they were just excited.)

796
00:28:26,082 --> 00:28:27,841
Sang Uk is good at questions about the Middle Ages.

797
00:28:27,842 --> 00:28:29,852
- The Middle Ages. - Is that really the answer?

798
00:28:30,482 --> 00:28:32,782
We must remember what Sang Uk said.

799
00:28:32,852 --> 00:28:34,652
The Middles Ages is all about life and death.

800
00:28:35,122 --> 00:28:36,651
The Middle Ages is about life and death.

801
00:28:36,652 --> 00:28:38,521
Look forward...

802
00:28:38,522 --> 00:28:39,962
- This vibe... - to taking the quiz.

803
00:28:40,262 --> 00:28:41,262
Look forward to it.

804
00:28:41,422 --> 00:28:43,261
If I lose,

805
00:28:43,262 --> 00:28:46,262
a bite of aglio e olio would cost me 320 dollars.

806
00:28:47,262 --> 00:28:48,772
- It serves them right. - Let's go.

807
00:28:48,972 --> 00:28:52,642
Sauces are necessary when it comes to western food.

808
00:28:53,102 --> 00:28:55,072
"Sauce" originates...

809
00:28:55,202 --> 00:28:58,782
from the Latin word "sal."

810
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:02,042
The word "salaryman" also originates from it.

811
00:29:02,352 --> 00:29:04,151
- What does "sal" mean? - I got it.

812
00:29:04,152 --> 00:29:05,152
Salt.

813
00:29:05,153 --> 00:29:06,321
(He shouted "salt" as soon as the question was given.)

814
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:07,751
(No way.)

815
00:29:07,752 --> 00:29:09,491
- Salt. - Salt?

816
00:29:09,492 --> 00:29:10,492
Correct.

817
00:29:10,493 --> 00:29:11,892
(Answer: Salt)

818
00:29:12,052 --> 00:29:13,262
Salt? Correct.

819
00:29:13,392 --> 00:29:14,922
(Surprised)

820
00:29:15,362 --> 00:29:16,362
Wait a minute.

821
00:29:16,363 --> 00:29:17,462
(Are you kidding?)

822
00:29:17,692 --> 00:29:19,031
(It serves him right.)

823
00:29:19,032 --> 00:29:20,262
How could you...

824
00:29:20,432 --> 00:29:21,831
I didn't even get to say a thing.

825
00:29:21,832 --> 00:29:23,701
Thank you for the food.

826
00:29:23,702 --> 00:29:25,622
(Except for Dong Hyun, everyone is celebrating.)

827
00:29:25,772 --> 00:29:27,441
(Helplessly, he has to pay the bill of 320 dollars.)

828
00:29:27,442 --> 00:29:28,472
But...

829
00:29:29,242 --> 00:29:31,272
Wasn't the question too easy?

830
00:29:31,712 --> 00:29:32,741
He couldn't say a word.

831
00:29:32,742 --> 00:29:33,982
- Hello? - Who are you calling?

832
00:29:34,012 --> 00:29:36,252
- It's cooked. - The small octopus is cooked?

833
00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:38,211
How many bowls of rice do you want?

834
00:29:38,212 --> 00:29:39,821
He learned it from you.

835
00:29:39,822 --> 00:29:41,282
(Life is like a boomerang.)

836
00:29:42,192 --> 00:29:44,192
I have to pay 320 dollars without eating anything.

837
00:29:45,122 --> 00:29:46,262
Aglio e olio.

838
00:29:46,562 --> 00:29:48,021
I'll never eat aglio e olio again.

839
00:29:48,022 --> 00:29:49,261
(Renouncing aglio e olio starting today)

840
00:29:49,262 --> 00:29:51,932
The aglio e olio cost me 321 dollars.

841
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,061
He's finally smiling.

842
00:29:54,062 --> 00:29:55,631
(On the other hand, he's all smiles.)

843
00:29:55,632 --> 00:29:57,201
Tae Eun, why do you keep calling me?

844
00:29:57,202 --> 00:29:58,202
- I'm at work. - Hello?

845
00:29:58,572 --> 00:30:00,401
(Suddenly, he got a call from his daughter.)

846
00:30:00,402 --> 00:30:01,501
What is it?

847
00:30:01,502 --> 00:30:03,102
Send me some allowance. I have no money.

848
00:30:03,872 --> 00:30:05,112
How much do you need?

849
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:07,642
How much? I can give you as much as you want.

850
00:30:07,842 --> 00:30:08,851
Dad, what's wrong with you?

851
00:30:08,852 --> 00:30:10,058
- I'm in a good mood. - "Dad, what's wrong with you?"

852
00:30:10,082 --> 00:30:11,411
- "Dad, what's wrong with you?" - I'm in a good mood.

853
00:30:11,412 --> 00:30:13,152
I got one quiz right.

854
00:30:13,382 --> 00:30:15,051
- What's wrong with you? - Say it fast.

855
00:30:15,052 --> 00:30:16,492
How much do you need?

856
00:30:16,692 --> 00:30:18,321
- Just my allowance in May. - A thousand dollars.

857
00:30:18,322 --> 00:30:19,362
Okay.

858
00:30:19,722 --> 00:30:20,722
- Bye. - Bye.

859
00:30:20,792 --> 00:30:22,062
I don't know how much it is.

860
00:30:22,962 --> 00:30:24,792
In my opinion, she's in a good mood today.

861
00:30:24,932 --> 00:30:26,062
She had an exam earlier.

862
00:30:26,732 --> 00:30:28,731
Students had midterms today.

863
00:30:28,732 --> 00:30:30,012
(It's her last day of midterms.)

864
00:30:30,272 --> 00:30:31,531
After she got out of school,

865
00:30:31,532 --> 00:30:32,932
she asked her dad for an allowance.

866
00:30:33,802 --> 00:30:35,141
He sent her 1,000 dollars so easily.

867
00:30:35,142 --> 00:30:37,411
(He sent her 1,000 dollars so easily.)

868
00:30:37,412 --> 00:30:39,041
One thousand dollars? That'd be amazing.

869
00:30:39,042 --> 00:30:40,482
He sent her 1,000 dollars so easily.

870
00:30:40,742 --> 00:30:41,782
Seriously?

871
00:30:42,312 --> 00:30:43,411
I can't send her 1,000 dollars.

872
00:30:43,412 --> 00:30:45,751
- You didn't? - My wife would scold me.

873
00:30:45,752 --> 00:30:46,752
How much did you send her?

874
00:30:46,753 --> 00:30:47,881
I sent her 100 dollars.

875
00:30:47,882 --> 00:30:48,921
- What else can I do? - One hundred?

876
00:30:48,922 --> 00:30:49,951
(Tae Hyun sent allowance to his daughter, )

877
00:30:49,952 --> 00:30:52,591
(and Dong Hyun went to pay for the food.)

878
00:30:52,592 --> 00:30:53,991
All right.

879
00:30:53,992 --> 00:30:55,421
- That's 311 dollars. - Sure.

880
00:30:55,422 --> 00:30:57,462
- Right, 311 dollars. - I'll take your credit card.

881
00:30:59,062 --> 00:31:00,801
- Here's your card. - Thanks.

882
00:31:00,802 --> 00:31:01,862
Thank you.

883
00:31:02,332 --> 00:31:04,272
- We enjoyed the meal. - Thank you.

884
00:31:04,602 --> 00:31:06,502
I'm never having aglio e olio again.

885
00:31:08,302 --> 00:31:11,642
(After their delicious first meal, they leave Buam-dong.)

886
00:31:12,642 --> 00:31:15,542
(Seochon)

887
00:31:16,782 --> 00:31:18,451
(A neighborhood west of Gyeongbokgung Palace)

888
00:31:18,452 --> 00:31:21,652
(That's why it was given the name, Seochon.)

889
00:31:22,122 --> 00:31:24,121
(These days, it attracts many tourists...)

890
00:31:24,122 --> 00:31:26,092
(visiting the nearby palaces.)

891
00:31:26,492 --> 00:31:28,391
(But there still are many major companies...)

892
00:31:28,392 --> 00:31:30,291
(and government offices in the vicinity.)

893
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:32,432
I'm hungry.

894
00:31:32,632 --> 00:31:34,102
I'm really hungry.

895
00:31:34,432 --> 00:31:35,902
What is this place?

896
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:38,701
- Check this out. - Hanok.

897
00:31:38,702 --> 00:31:40,702
There's a certain vibe to this neighborhood.

898
00:31:41,372 --> 00:31:43,571
There are all of these places serving Korean cuisine.

899
00:31:43,572 --> 00:31:44,642
That looks nice.

900
00:31:45,272 --> 00:31:46,581
- Many serve set menus. - Right.

901
00:31:46,582 --> 00:31:47,711
I see a lot of Korean set menus.

902
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:50,032
(One after another, there are Korean cuisine restaurants.)

903
00:31:50,252 --> 00:31:52,381
This neighborhood has been home...

904
00:31:52,382 --> 00:31:55,421
to many government agencies and public offices.

905
00:31:55,422 --> 00:31:56,451
Many of their employees...

906
00:31:56,452 --> 00:31:58,221
- come here to eat. - This alley?

907
00:31:58,222 --> 00:31:59,321
That's why there are a lot of tasty places.

908
00:31:59,322 --> 00:32:01,921
That must be why a lot of places that serve Korean set menus...

909
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:03,661
- are still around here. - Is that why there are...

910
00:32:03,662 --> 00:32:05,361
- many places that serve Korean? - Yes.

911
00:32:05,362 --> 00:32:07,882
(Many old establishments still serve classic Korean set meals.)

912
00:32:08,162 --> 00:32:10,132
You weren't wrong.

913
00:32:10,302 --> 00:32:11,402
Isn't this the place?

914
00:32:11,732 --> 00:32:14,372
- Is this it? - No way. Check out this place.

915
00:32:15,042 --> 00:32:16,311
You won't believe it.

916
00:32:16,312 --> 00:32:17,541
I didn't know Seoul still had alleys like this.

917
00:32:17,542 --> 00:32:19,341
I love it. I love neighborhoods like this.

918
00:32:19,342 --> 00:32:20,758
(An alley that gives you all the feels)

919
00:32:20,782 --> 00:32:22,511
It's like an alley in Jeonju.

920
00:32:22,512 --> 00:32:24,112
Tell me about it. You're right.

921
00:32:24,552 --> 00:32:26,281
- This must be it. - This must be it. South Jeolla.

922
00:32:26,282 --> 00:32:28,582
(In front of them is a peaceful hanok restaurant.)

923
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,552
Gosh, the smell.

924
00:32:32,252 --> 00:32:34,592
- This is no ordinary place. - This place...

925
00:32:34,792 --> 00:32:36,661
Don't you think it's been around for a long time?

926
00:32:36,662 --> 00:32:37,692
- Yes. - Look over here.

927
00:32:38,432 --> 00:32:40,501
"Favored by the president." Let's head inside.

928
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:41,601
A leader's...

929
00:32:41,602 --> 00:32:43,831
- Shall we? - It serves Jeolla cuisine.

930
00:32:43,832 --> 00:32:44,832
(Which dishes await them?)

931
00:32:44,833 --> 00:32:45,872
I'm starving.

932
00:32:46,642 --> 00:32:49,512
(A serene Korean restaurant bearing the marks of time)

933
00:32:49,912 --> 00:32:53,882
(Food that tastes just like it did 40 years ago)

934
00:32:54,742 --> 00:32:58,512
(A place that serves delicious food of the south)

935
00:32:59,222 --> 00:33:03,092
(A hidden spot in Seochon that's always bustling with people)

936
00:33:03,452 --> 00:33:05,351
It's the first place that comes to mind...

937
00:33:05,352 --> 00:33:07,261
when I want to have a Korean set menu.

938
00:33:07,262 --> 00:33:10,461
I chose this place because even the former president...

939
00:33:10,462 --> 00:33:11,491
had eaten here.

940
00:33:11,492 --> 00:33:14,261
I've been coming here to eat for about 30 years now.

941
00:33:14,262 --> 00:33:16,271
The flavors remind me of my hometown.

942
00:33:16,272 --> 00:33:18,271
Fresh and natural.

943
00:33:18,272 --> 00:33:20,372
It's so delightful, I keep returning for more.

944
00:33:21,742 --> 00:33:25,271
(Lunch Menu Recommendation 2, Southern Korean set menu)

945
00:33:25,272 --> 00:33:26,681
- I'm starving. - Right?

946
00:33:26,682 --> 00:33:27,742
Yes.

947
00:33:27,982 --> 00:33:28,982
I'm hungry.

948
00:33:28,983 --> 00:33:30,663
(Scanning the menu right after walking in)

949
00:33:30,852 --> 00:33:33,322
A skate combo. Hey, I smell skate.

950
00:33:34,122 --> 00:33:36,422
- Hey, I smell skate. - It's pricey, though.

951
00:33:37,322 --> 00:33:39,121
It's a fancy restaurant.

952
00:33:39,122 --> 00:33:41,361
- The food here is pricey. - Check this place out.

953
00:33:41,362 --> 00:33:42,862
- Hello. - Hello.

954
00:33:42,962 --> 00:33:44,661
- Hello. - Goodness.

955
00:33:44,662 --> 00:33:46,401
- Hello. - Hello.

956
00:33:46,402 --> 00:33:48,661
Hello, my goodness.

957
00:33:48,662 --> 00:33:52,441
Whenever I see a restaurant that serves southern cuisine,

958
00:33:52,442 --> 00:33:54,571
- I immediately get hungry. - Really?

959
00:33:54,572 --> 00:33:55,672
Exactly.

960
00:33:56,112 --> 00:33:58,841
What are the characteristics of southern cuisine?

961
00:33:58,842 --> 00:34:01,842
Is it different from the food in Jeolla Province?

962
00:34:02,552 --> 00:34:04,881
Well, you see,

963
00:34:04,882 --> 00:34:06,821
- I'm from Jeolla Province. - Right.

964
00:34:06,822 --> 00:34:09,951
That's why I try to serve food from the region.

965
00:34:09,952 --> 00:34:10,952
- Southern... - The question just now.

966
00:34:10,953 --> 00:34:13,491
- He said it wrong. - Exactly.

967
00:34:13,492 --> 00:34:15,061
Southern food is food in South Jeolla Province.

968
00:34:15,062 --> 00:34:17,132
Exactly. I realized that after saying it.

969
00:34:17,492 --> 00:34:18,961
Does southern cuisine stand for food in South Jeolla Province?

970
00:34:18,962 --> 00:34:20,661
That's right. As a whole.

971
00:34:20,662 --> 00:34:22,101
I thought it was a name of an island.

972
00:34:22,102 --> 00:34:23,332
Gosh, no.

973
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:27,301
- I'm sorry. - I bet everyone else knew.

974
00:34:27,302 --> 00:34:28,402
Are you that dumb?

975
00:34:29,042 --> 00:34:30,511
- That surprised me. - I thought it referred...

976
00:34:30,512 --> 00:34:32,782
to an island in Jeolla Province.

977
00:34:33,882 --> 00:34:37,951
Jeolla Province has mountains, the ocean, and mud flats.

978
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:41,281
A variety of ingredients can be found in the region.

979
00:34:41,282 --> 00:34:43,421
That's why they serve so many side dishes.

980
00:34:43,422 --> 00:34:44,521
Yes, mud flats.

981
00:34:44,522 --> 00:34:45,961
You think of raw octopus.

982
00:34:45,962 --> 00:34:47,461
- Octopus skewer. - And octopus soup.

983
00:34:47,462 --> 00:34:48,961
- Yes, octopus soup. - Order whatever you want.

984
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:51,261
Also, brown croaker is in season.

985
00:34:51,262 --> 00:34:53,502
So I recommend raw brown croaker.

986
00:34:54,162 --> 00:34:56,772
I must have the raw brown croaker.

987
00:34:57,872 --> 00:34:59,101
Do you like skate?

988
00:34:59,102 --> 00:35:00,941
- I love it. - Do you?

989
00:35:00,942 --> 00:35:02,941
- I love skate. - Got it.

990
00:35:02,942 --> 00:35:04,841
Braised hairtail is also good.

991
00:35:04,842 --> 00:35:06,382
I love anything that has been braised.

992
00:35:06,882 --> 00:35:07,941
Braised?

993
00:35:07,942 --> 00:35:09,851
I'll serve a meal with a bit of them all.

994
00:35:09,852 --> 00:35:11,151
- Thank you. - No problem.

995
00:35:11,152 --> 00:35:12,581
- We'll look forward to it. - Sure.

996
00:35:12,582 --> 00:35:13,881
- Thank you. - Of course.

997
00:35:13,882 --> 00:35:15,498
(Octopus skewers, raw brown croaker, braised hairtail, skate combo)

998
00:35:15,522 --> 00:35:16,922
I'll take off my back brace.

999
00:35:18,392 --> 00:35:19,392
Is your back all right?

1000
00:35:19,562 --> 00:35:20,962
I should get ready to eat.

1001
00:35:21,262 --> 00:35:22,492
Nice.

1002
00:35:22,862 --> 00:35:24,062
(Removing back brace)

1003
00:35:24,262 --> 00:35:25,291
Okay.

1004
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:28,232
(He's prepared physically and mentally.)

1005
00:35:28,562 --> 00:35:29,571
Here it comes.

1006
00:35:29,572 --> 00:35:31,832
(Side dishes are served first.)

1007
00:35:32,202 --> 00:35:34,272
(My gosh!)

1008
00:35:34,642 --> 00:35:37,242
(Side dishes enter.)

1009
00:35:37,612 --> 00:35:40,212
A southern set menu starts with these.

1010
00:35:40,612 --> 00:35:42,041
(A southern set menu will be served.)

1011
00:35:42,042 --> 00:35:43,112
Here we go.

1012
00:35:43,212 --> 00:35:44,912
- These days... - Gosh, that.

1013
00:35:45,152 --> 00:35:47,522
(Amazed by the side dishes)

1014
00:35:47,822 --> 00:35:48,881
Gosh, I'm hungry.

1015
00:35:48,882 --> 00:35:50,122
(The main event begins.)

1016
00:35:50,392 --> 00:35:51,551
(The main dish is served.)

1017
00:35:51,552 --> 00:35:52,992
No way. I need to have one of those.

1018
00:35:53,062 --> 00:35:54,722
Look how big it is.

1019
00:35:55,222 --> 00:35:57,062
It's way bigger than seasoned octopus skewers.

1020
00:35:57,162 --> 00:35:58,331
Is it this big?

1021
00:35:58,332 --> 00:36:01,602
(A big plump small octopus from the mud flat)

1022
00:36:02,162 --> 00:36:03,932
(Tossed inside a heated pan)

1023
00:36:04,202 --> 00:36:08,672
(It is briefly grilled on high heat with sesame oil.)

1024
00:36:09,842 --> 00:36:14,212
(Lastly, smokiness is added.)

1025
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:18,112
(Once it's cooked to an appetizing color)

1026
00:36:18,712 --> 00:36:22,152
(The small octopus is served on a skewer, Octopus skewer)

1027
00:36:22,382 --> 00:36:24,652
(In awe)

1028
00:36:25,122 --> 00:36:27,092
That small octopus looks great.

1029
00:36:28,322 --> 00:36:29,461
- Enjoy. - Sure.

1030
00:36:29,462 --> 00:36:33,562
(The owner cuts the small octopus for them.)

1031
00:36:34,832 --> 00:36:39,702
May I have the skewer?

1032
00:36:40,142 --> 00:36:41,601
- This? Why? - Is it served with sesame oil?

1033
00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:42,611
To taste the flavors.

1034
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:43,972
Goodness.

1035
00:36:44,472 --> 00:36:47,281
Am I allowed to at least lick this skewer?

1036
00:36:47,282 --> 00:36:48,641
- Of course. - Really?

1037
00:36:48,642 --> 00:36:49,852
Go ahead. We'll allow that.

1038
00:36:50,152 --> 00:36:51,452
It'll only make you hungrier.

1039
00:36:52,082 --> 00:36:53,221
Yes, exactly.

1040
00:36:53,222 --> 00:36:56,122
(A new type of appetizer)

1041
00:36:56,322 --> 00:36:58,192
Dong Hyun, that's the best.

1042
00:36:58,292 --> 00:36:59,322
Really?

1043
00:36:59,822 --> 00:37:03,161
(The next dish is served.)

1044
00:37:03,162 --> 00:37:04,662
Gosh, that looks so good.

1045
00:37:04,962 --> 00:37:06,502
How can the small octopus be that big?

1046
00:37:07,562 --> 00:37:13,502
(The Korean beef of the sea, raw brown croaker in season)

1047
00:37:14,802 --> 00:37:16,812
The brown croaker looks really good.

1048
00:37:17,442 --> 00:37:18,471
I'd like a piece of that.

1049
00:37:18,472 --> 00:37:20,552
(The taste he knows so well has his mouth watering.)

1050
00:37:21,412 --> 00:37:23,212
It's the skate. That looks good.

1051
00:37:23,682 --> 00:37:25,051
They look so pretty.

1052
00:37:25,052 --> 00:37:27,721
(The harmonious skate combo from Heuksan Island)

1053
00:37:27,722 --> 00:37:29,352
Yes, from Heuksan Island.

1054
00:37:31,852 --> 00:37:35,022
(And what must be served)

1055
00:37:35,892 --> 00:37:37,231
Check out the colors on that aged kimchi.

1056
00:37:37,232 --> 00:37:38,292
(The tangy aged kimchi)

1057
00:37:38,362 --> 00:37:40,962
(Hurrah for the aged kimchi)

1058
00:37:41,562 --> 00:37:42,802
Aged kimchi of Jeolla Province.

1059
00:37:43,372 --> 00:37:45,672
The aged kimchi is almost translucent.

1060
00:37:46,902 --> 00:37:48,301
I'd like to smell that.

1061
00:37:48,302 --> 00:37:49,712
Gosh, the smell of fish sauce.

1062
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:51,472
The smell of fish sauce.

1063
00:37:52,142 --> 00:37:53,681
(That's what I'm talking about.)

1064
00:37:53,682 --> 00:37:54,758
That's what I'm talking about.

1065
00:37:54,782 --> 00:37:56,512
There's even seaweed fulvescens soup.

1066
00:37:56,812 --> 00:37:58,382
The table might not hold all this food.

1067
00:37:59,252 --> 00:38:03,751
(A southern Korean set menu too heavy for the table)

1068
00:38:03,752 --> 00:38:07,491
My grandmother and parents...

1069
00:38:07,492 --> 00:38:09,591
are all from Goheung, South Jeolla Province.

1070
00:38:09,592 --> 00:38:11,892
I feel like I'm at my grandmother's. This is the best.

1071
00:38:12,462 --> 00:38:14,331
- I'll enjoy. - Please enjoy.

1072
00:38:14,332 --> 00:38:15,562
Could we also have our rice?

1073
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:17,971
What about our rice?

1074
00:38:17,972 --> 00:38:19,471
That'll be served soon.

1075
00:38:19,472 --> 00:38:23,072
- Please enjoy these first. - Have that later on.

1076
00:38:23,242 --> 00:38:24,911
- I should try this as is. - It'll be served later.

1077
00:38:24,912 --> 00:38:26,981
- Sure. - Just enjoy the food as is.

1078
00:38:26,982 --> 00:38:28,042
- As is? - Yes.

1079
00:38:28,482 --> 00:38:31,051
Aster leaves are in season. Have a sniff of that.

1080
00:38:31,052 --> 00:38:33,351
- It's good. What is it? - You won't get it anywhere else.

1081
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:37,092
(A smile spreads across his face every time he chews.)

1082
00:38:37,592 --> 00:38:39,691
- It's so good. - Without any sauce.

1083
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,121
- Really? - For real?

1084
00:38:41,122 --> 00:38:42,832
(Jealous)

1085
00:38:43,232 --> 00:38:44,632
Have it as is.

1086
00:38:44,662 --> 00:38:45,762
- As is? - Yes.

1087
00:38:47,162 --> 00:38:48,662
(Yummy)

1088
00:38:49,372 --> 00:38:51,272
(My gosh!)

1089
00:38:51,402 --> 00:38:52,631
It doesn't need a dip.

1090
00:38:52,632 --> 00:38:54,101
It's so good.

1091
00:38:54,102 --> 00:38:56,111
Exactly. Have it without any sauce.

1092
00:38:56,112 --> 00:38:57,141
For real?

1093
00:38:57,142 --> 00:38:58,871
- Is it good? - For real?

1094
00:38:58,872 --> 00:39:00,042
(Blissful)

1095
00:39:00,582 --> 00:39:05,412
(Gently stir-fried in sesame oil, The salty flavors of small octopus)

1096
00:39:07,152 --> 00:39:11,652
(Flavors that make them curious)

1097
00:39:13,822 --> 00:39:14,921
How can it be this tender?

1098
00:39:14,922 --> 00:39:17,362
(A second bite of the small octopus with sliced green onions)

1099
00:39:18,632 --> 00:39:21,132
Octopus, squid, and small octopus.

1100
00:39:21,362 --> 00:39:23,501
They turn rubbery when cooked for too long.

1101
00:39:23,502 --> 00:39:24,871
- It's so tender! - But this is tender,

1102
00:39:24,872 --> 00:39:27,971
and you can see that it is. It's translucent.

1103
00:39:27,972 --> 00:39:30,542
- That's skill. - The octopus must be fresh.

1104
00:39:30,972 --> 00:39:32,371
I can't believe this.

1105
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:34,182
This is insane.

1106
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:38,182
We'd appreciate it if you could reserve...

1107
00:39:38,252 --> 00:39:40,321
this combo for us.

1108
00:39:40,322 --> 00:39:41,951
- And... - This is so good.

1109
00:39:41,952 --> 00:39:44,121
- We haven't had this before. - I'm sorry,

1110
00:39:44,122 --> 00:39:45,221
- but that's for me. - Yes, go ahead.

1111
00:39:45,222 --> 00:39:46,322
I haven't had this before.

1112
00:39:46,562 --> 00:39:47,922
No, not that.

1113
00:39:48,822 --> 00:39:49,862
(It's mine.)

1114
00:39:49,962 --> 00:39:52,232
- It's so tender. - Eating it like that...

1115
00:39:52,292 --> 00:39:54,901
It's not rubbery, but pleasantly chewy.

1116
00:39:54,902 --> 00:39:57,002
It dances around in my mouth every time I chew.

1117
00:40:01,102 --> 00:40:02,471
Can you try the brown croaker?

1118
00:40:02,472 --> 00:40:03,541
- The raw brown croaker. - Right.

1119
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:05,842
Have the brown croaker and then the skate.

1120
00:40:06,942 --> 00:40:09,982
(An invigorating summer dish, raw brown croaker)

1121
00:40:10,652 --> 00:40:14,222
(Gently dipped in a sesame oil dip)

1122
00:40:14,322 --> 00:40:15,452
There's no salt.

1123
00:40:15,682 --> 00:40:17,351
I haven't had this with sesame oil before.

1124
00:40:17,352 --> 00:40:18,391
Same here. This is a first.

1125
00:40:18,392 --> 00:40:19,712
The brown croaker is what I want.

1126
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,361
(The owner recommended raw brown croaker with sesame oil.)

1127
00:40:21,362 --> 00:40:22,522
I want the skate combo.

1128
00:40:23,832 --> 00:40:25,792
I'll try the sesame oil dip first.

1129
00:40:27,532 --> 00:40:28,561
(No way)

1130
00:40:28,562 --> 00:40:30,272
I haven't seen anything like this before.

1131
00:40:30,702 --> 00:40:31,931
(Dong Hyun dips a slice in the sesame oil dip too.)

1132
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:33,972
She said it was in season. Does it taste different?

1133
00:40:35,042 --> 00:40:38,612
(The nutty flavors of the sesame oil spread the more he chews.)

1134
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,581
She said it was in season. How is it different from other fish?

1135
00:40:40,582 --> 00:40:41,858
(He's curious about the taste of raw brown croaker.)

1136
00:40:41,882 --> 00:40:44,212
I don't know how it's different from beef steak.

1137
00:40:44,312 --> 00:40:45,611
- Isn't it firm? - It is.

1138
00:40:45,612 --> 00:40:47,222
The meat of this fish...

1139
00:40:47,252 --> 00:40:49,122
I like raw brown croaker and eat it often.

1140
00:40:49,322 --> 00:40:51,621
I get what it means for it to be in season.

1141
00:40:51,622 --> 00:40:53,491
That's why it's fresh.

1142
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:56,891
I can tell the fish is meaty.

1143
00:40:56,892 --> 00:40:58,531
And also,

1144
00:40:58,532 --> 00:41:00,761
- it doesn't have a foul smell. - It's not here yet.

1145
00:41:00,762 --> 00:41:02,761
It has some thin bones.

1146
00:41:02,762 --> 00:41:05,302
But the bones crumble, which I love.

1147
00:41:06,502 --> 00:41:07,741
- It's even better. - But...

1148
00:41:07,742 --> 00:41:09,302
the bones crumble, which I love.

1149
00:41:09,472 --> 00:41:12,272
(Trying with vinegar gochujang this time)

1150
00:41:12,742 --> 00:41:14,341
- Gosh. - It's so tasty.

1151
00:41:14,342 --> 00:41:15,542
(Surprised)

1152
00:41:15,582 --> 00:41:17,452
- This isn't an ordinary restaurant. - Also...

1153
00:41:18,112 --> 00:41:19,181
Dong Hyun,

1154
00:41:19,182 --> 00:41:20,428
- please leave a couple of pieces. - What?

1155
00:41:20,452 --> 00:41:21,951
Please leave them.

1156
00:41:21,952 --> 00:41:23,522
Three pieces?

1157
00:41:24,052 --> 00:41:25,151
One of you won't be eating anyway.

1158
00:41:25,152 --> 00:41:27,391
- Then leave two pieces. - I want to try it like this.

1159
00:41:27,392 --> 00:41:28,792
You can leave two pieces, right?

1160
00:41:29,062 --> 00:41:31,132
- I'll leave two pieces for you. - That isn't much.

1161
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,678
(Dong Hyun leaves two pieces of the brown croaker for them.)

1162
00:41:33,702 --> 00:41:35,862
- This kimchi is... - Gosh. This aged kimchi.

1163
00:41:36,002 --> 00:41:39,072
(The South Jeolla Province food expert is amazed.)

1164
00:41:39,672 --> 00:41:41,742
(Ma'am, you're the best.)

1165
00:41:42,642 --> 00:41:44,942
(The refreshing and tangy aged kimchi)

1166
00:41:45,372 --> 00:41:48,311
You can't get that color artificially.

1167
00:41:48,312 --> 00:41:49,382
It's transparent.

1168
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:55,482
(You have to have the aged kimchi with skate.)

1169
00:41:55,522 --> 00:41:57,452
Tae Hyun isn't a fan of skate.

1170
00:41:58,022 --> 00:42:00,262
- I can handle this type of skate. - Seriously.

1171
00:42:00,622 --> 00:42:03,132
I can enjoy it as a skate combo...

1172
00:42:03,362 --> 00:42:05,562
because the kimchi will cancel out he pungent smell.

1173
00:42:06,562 --> 00:42:07,761
Gosh, Tae Hyun.

1174
00:42:07,762 --> 00:42:09,122
(Taking a bite without hesitation)

1175
00:42:09,162 --> 00:42:10,562
You have to have it with makgeolli.

1176
00:42:13,972 --> 00:42:15,442
- Right. - This kimchi is...

1177
00:42:15,642 --> 00:42:17,942
With this kimchi only, it's over.

1178
00:42:18,342 --> 00:42:19,511
Gosh, Dong Hyun.

1179
00:42:19,512 --> 00:42:21,272
(Dong Hyun tries a bite of skate combo too.)

1180
00:42:24,452 --> 00:42:27,551
(Stimulating salivary glands)

1181
00:42:27,552 --> 00:42:29,082
I'm getting worked up a little.

1182
00:42:29,122 --> 00:42:31,792
(This is it.)

1183
00:42:31,822 --> 00:42:33,091
It's hard to watch.

1184
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,862
(It's hard to watch.)

1185
00:42:35,322 --> 00:42:39,091
Kimchi cancels out the pungent smell of the skate.

1186
00:42:39,092 --> 00:42:40,201
(The aged kimchi decreases skate's pungent smell pleasantly.)

1187
00:42:40,202 --> 00:42:41,532
This kimchi is crazy, indeed.

1188
00:42:41,802 --> 00:42:43,371
The skate has a hard part that is like bone.

1189
00:42:43,372 --> 00:42:44,871
- That's the tasty part. - That's tastier.

1190
00:42:44,872 --> 00:42:46,172
It's just right. Also,

1191
00:42:46,232 --> 00:42:49,611
it's the best and most premium skate combo I've ever had.

1192
00:42:49,612 --> 00:42:52,172
(It's a rich and high-quality taste without being overpowering.)

1193
00:42:52,742 --> 00:42:54,842
Tae Hyun eats it very well.

1194
00:42:55,242 --> 00:42:57,752
(Tae Hyun's appetite has increased.)

1195
00:42:58,382 --> 00:43:00,722
I had spaghetti without thinking about skate.

1196
00:43:00,922 --> 00:43:02,152
I'm so hungry.

1197
00:43:02,282 --> 00:43:03,491
I should have had this.

1198
00:43:03,492 --> 00:43:06,091
I love braised half-dried pollack so much.

1199
00:43:06,092 --> 00:43:07,162
Anyway, we...

1200
00:43:07,662 --> 00:43:09,382
The braised half-dried pollack is so tasty.

1201
00:43:12,492 --> 00:43:13,601
- I'll have it as is. - Yes.

1202
00:43:13,602 --> 00:43:15,002
(Steamed cockles)

1203
00:43:18,272 --> 00:43:20,702
(Acorn jelly)

1204
00:43:23,412 --> 00:43:26,641
Usually, the food of Jeolla Province is salty, but...

1205
00:43:26,642 --> 00:43:28,082
- it's not salty here. - Goodness.

1206
00:43:28,442 --> 00:43:29,852
- What? - His nose.

1207
00:43:31,382 --> 00:43:33,351
(What?)

1208
00:43:33,352 --> 00:43:35,621
We said we'd be decent and classy this time.

1209
00:43:35,622 --> 00:43:36,752
Be decent.

1210
00:43:36,892 --> 00:43:38,091
Sorry.

1211
00:43:38,092 --> 00:43:40,591
Did it come out of your nose or go inside?

1212
00:43:40,592 --> 00:43:42,091
- Did it come out or go in? - Well.

1213
00:43:42,092 --> 00:43:43,692
(Did it come out of your nose or go in?)

1214
00:43:43,992 --> 00:43:45,861
- Did it come out or go in? - Well.

1215
00:43:45,862 --> 00:43:47,161
It slapped my nose...

1216
00:43:47,162 --> 00:43:48,432
- when I sipped it. - Liar.

1217
00:43:48,562 --> 00:43:49,801
You're playing judo with food.

1218
00:43:49,802 --> 00:43:51,702
If it has...

1219
00:43:52,232 --> 00:43:55,341
Should I say that it tastes clean?

1220
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:57,972
No matter how much I eat it, it's not overwhelming.

1221
00:43:58,772 --> 00:44:00,442
Goodness.

1222
00:44:00,982 --> 00:44:03,881
If it has oyster in it,

1223
00:44:03,882 --> 00:44:05,081
I don't need skate and others.

1224
00:44:05,082 --> 00:44:07,852
I would have said, I'd just have it with a spoonful of rice.

1225
00:44:08,352 --> 00:44:10,752
They usually have oysters in it, right?

1226
00:44:13,292 --> 00:44:14,791
(He can't bear it.)

1227
00:44:14,792 --> 00:44:15,962
It's tough, isn't it?

1228
00:44:16,392 --> 00:44:17,632
Seriously. Gosh.

1229
00:44:17,862 --> 00:44:20,501
Of these three dishes,

1230
00:44:20,502 --> 00:44:22,201
one can have just one.

1231
00:44:22,202 --> 00:44:23,601
- Is a spoonful of everything okay? - Yes.

1232
00:44:23,602 --> 00:44:25,072
Wait. No.

1233
00:44:25,132 --> 00:44:26,871
- Pick 1 dish. - Just 1?

1234
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,141
- You have to pick one. - But...

1235
00:44:28,142 --> 00:44:29,571
You mixed the two before.

1236
00:44:29,572 --> 00:44:31,471
You piled everything up too.

1237
00:44:31,472 --> 00:44:33,442
- You put the duck... - Let us have a bite.

1238
00:44:33,642 --> 00:44:35,382
- on aglio e olio. - Okay.

1239
00:44:35,682 --> 00:44:37,611
Let's have the first round of the South Jeolla Province food.

1240
00:44:37,612 --> 00:44:39,512
Give us the quiz for one bite.

1241
00:44:39,612 --> 00:44:41,681
I'll give you the names of four movies.

1242
00:44:41,682 --> 00:44:43,428
Please say them in the order of their release date.

1243
00:44:43,452 --> 00:44:44,652
"Escape from Mogadishu,"

1244
00:44:44,752 --> 00:44:46,251
"A Taxi Driver,"

1245
00:44:46,252 --> 00:44:47,691
"Intimate Strangers,"

1246
00:44:47,692 --> 00:44:48,892
and "Extreme Job."

1247
00:44:49,392 --> 00:44:50,861
Gosh. One of them confuses me.

1248
00:44:50,862 --> 00:44:52,661
(Guess the order of the movies' release dates.)

1249
00:44:52,662 --> 00:44:54,231
- "Extreme Job." - They have to take a guess.

1250
00:44:54,232 --> 00:44:55,532
There's no way they'd know it.

1251
00:44:56,432 --> 00:44:58,431
(It's quite hard.)

1252
00:44:58,432 --> 00:45:00,542
- I got it. - From the oldest one?

1253
00:45:01,072 --> 00:45:02,571
"A Taxi Driver," "Intimate Strangers,"

1254
00:45:02,572 --> 00:45:04,292
"Extreme Job," and "Escape from Mogadishu."

1255
00:45:05,272 --> 00:45:08,542
(No way.)

1256
00:45:08,882 --> 00:45:10,851
- Correct. - What?

1257
00:45:10,852 --> 00:45:12,812
(He wins a chance to freeload.)

1258
00:45:12,912 --> 00:45:14,651
(The South Jeolla Province expert showed an amazing concentration.)

1259
00:45:14,652 --> 00:45:15,951
- Goodness. - Do you admit your defeat?

1260
00:45:15,952 --> 00:45:17,922
Please describe how it tastes profoundly.

1261
00:45:18,922 --> 00:45:20,392
Gosh. This place is really...

1262
00:45:20,762 --> 00:45:21,991
- I really... - I...

1263
00:45:21,992 --> 00:45:23,672
I wish we could come back here for dinner.

1264
00:45:24,762 --> 00:45:26,331
I knew about Sang Uk.

1265
00:45:26,332 --> 00:45:30,201
(I knew about Sang Uk.)

1266
00:45:30,202 --> 00:45:32,772
Except for me,

1267
00:45:33,342 --> 00:45:35,341
he can't exercise power over anyone.

1268
00:45:35,342 --> 00:45:37,211
He can't say anything as part of that team.

1269
00:45:37,212 --> 00:45:38,272
Goodness.

1270
00:45:38,412 --> 00:45:39,571
Hey, try it.

1271
00:45:39,572 --> 00:45:40,741
(It's finally the time to freeload.)

1272
00:45:40,742 --> 00:45:42,341
I would have eaten a hundred of them if there was no limit.

1273
00:45:42,342 --> 00:45:44,651
(He thinks hard to decide what to eat.)

1274
00:45:44,652 --> 00:45:47,222
If you eat just the kimchi, I'd still give you that.

1275
00:45:47,452 --> 00:45:48,822
That's the highlight.

1276
00:45:48,852 --> 00:45:50,422
You have to have kimchi.

1277
00:45:52,552 --> 00:45:56,221
(As everyone wishes for it...)

1278
00:45:56,222 --> 00:45:58,161
Put kimchi as a base.

1279
00:45:58,162 --> 00:45:59,961
- Kimchi. - He's building the base.

1280
00:45:59,962 --> 00:46:01,361
He has a bigger surface now.

1281
00:46:01,362 --> 00:46:02,501
(He lays the foundation with kimchi.)

1282
00:46:02,502 --> 00:46:03,701
Then bossam.

1283
00:46:03,702 --> 00:46:04,872
(Placing bossam)

1284
00:46:05,332 --> 00:46:08,642
(He builds the skate combo by the book.)

1285
00:46:08,802 --> 00:46:12,372
(Adding octopus skewer)

1286
00:46:13,012 --> 00:46:14,612
You can put it there. Yes.

1287
00:46:14,812 --> 00:46:17,211
I wonder what I should dip it in.

1288
00:46:17,212 --> 00:46:18,458
- Actually... - Are you going to dip it?

1289
00:46:18,482 --> 00:46:21,152
- You don't need to dip the octopus. - I recommend you...

1290
00:46:21,222 --> 00:46:23,422
to put a thin kimchi over it.

1291
00:46:23,792 --> 00:46:26,392
- I'd put three salted shrimps. - Nothing should stand out.

1292
00:46:26,452 --> 00:46:27,861
I'll put the salted shrimp.

1293
00:46:27,862 --> 00:46:29,662
- Just one of them. - Put that salted shrimp.

1294
00:46:30,092 --> 00:46:31,491
- The salted shrimp. - Kimchi is the perfect choice.

1295
00:46:31,492 --> 00:46:33,761
(A miniature version of South Jeolla Province meal...)

1296
00:46:33,762 --> 00:46:34,802
(by Shin-chelin)

1297
00:46:35,562 --> 00:46:36,872
Gosh. This is the one.

1298
00:46:37,472 --> 00:46:38,871
Be careful not to dislocate your jaw.

1299
00:46:38,872 --> 00:46:40,432
(Be careful not to dislocate your jaw.)

1300
00:46:42,172 --> 00:46:43,471
It's big.

1301
00:46:43,472 --> 00:46:44,912
- He put it in his mouth. - Gosh.

1302
00:46:45,012 --> 00:46:46,311
- He did it. - That was a clean move.

1303
00:46:46,312 --> 00:46:47,312
That looked clean.

1304
00:46:50,382 --> 00:46:52,912
- He shivered to open his mouth. - He did.

1305
00:46:52,952 --> 00:46:54,822
I could see his head shaking.

1306
00:46:55,022 --> 00:46:57,492
His jaw was dislocated slightly.

1307
00:46:58,492 --> 00:47:01,292
(Having a mouthful of free food)

1308
00:47:03,462 --> 00:47:05,861
(The flavors of South Jeolla Province...)

1309
00:47:05,862 --> 00:47:08,232
(burst in his mouth one by one.)

1310
00:47:08,832 --> 00:47:10,771
Gosh. Look at that kimchi seasoning.

1311
00:47:10,772 --> 00:47:12,302
Gosh. This raw brown croaker.

1312
00:47:13,002 --> 00:47:16,742
(It's even more painful because they know how they taste.)

1313
00:47:17,512 --> 00:47:22,112
(The skate combo gives out a pleasant tang.)

1314
00:47:23,912 --> 00:47:25,152
(Skate)

1315
00:47:29,782 --> 00:47:31,621
Ma'am, is the restroom door open?

1316
00:47:31,622 --> 00:47:32,892
Gosh.

1317
00:47:33,292 --> 00:47:35,292
(His olfactory sense is violated.)

1318
00:47:35,962 --> 00:47:38,332
(The rest of the course is here.)

1319
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:40,861
(The braised hairtail from Jeolla Province)

1320
00:47:40,862 --> 00:47:42,031
Look how thick it is.

1321
00:47:42,032 --> 00:47:45,502
(The braised hairtail from Jeolla Province)

1322
00:47:46,272 --> 00:47:48,901
(The spicy and sweet braised hairtail...)

1323
00:47:48,902 --> 00:47:51,512
(is the best accompaniment to rice.)

1324
00:47:52,842 --> 00:47:54,511
(Surprised)

1325
00:47:54,512 --> 00:47:55,712
Awesome.

1326
00:47:56,312 --> 00:47:58,381
Gosh. How big is this hairtail?

1327
00:47:58,382 --> 00:48:00,102
(The size of the hairtail is jaw-dropping.)

1328
00:48:01,252 --> 00:48:03,322
She brought a whole new set of food.

1329
00:48:04,092 --> 00:48:06,152
- I thought it was over. - Where should I put it?

1330
00:48:06,522 --> 00:48:07,522
I told you.

1331
00:48:07,523 --> 00:48:08,921
- They bring more with rice. - I can't believe it.

1332
00:48:08,922 --> 00:48:10,062
Is this everything now?

1333
00:48:10,292 --> 00:48:12,172
Let me have one last sip of the maesaengi soup.

1334
00:48:12,332 --> 00:48:17,072
(Spicy and refreshing octopus soup)

1335
00:48:21,302 --> 00:48:22,671
Can I ask for more?

1336
00:48:22,672 --> 00:48:24,341
Yes. Ask for more whenever you want.

1337
00:48:24,342 --> 00:48:26,541
- Gosh. The octopus soup... - Is the octopus soup tasty?

1338
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:27,712
Is very spicy.

1339
00:48:28,182 --> 00:48:29,881
It must be 50cm-long.

1340
00:48:29,882 --> 00:48:30,981
(Next is the incredible braised hairtail.)

1341
00:48:30,982 --> 00:48:32,988
- I'm an expert at deboning it. - I should bring my kids.

1342
00:48:33,012 --> 00:48:35,052
- That's good. - That's right.

1343
00:48:35,382 --> 00:48:37,092
- That's it. - That's right.

1344
00:48:37,652 --> 00:48:39,122
Gosh. This is driving me nuts.

1345
00:48:39,492 --> 00:48:40,761
- Look. - Try it already.

1346
00:48:40,762 --> 00:48:43,121
(Having a spoonful of rice with the hairtail)

1347
00:48:43,122 --> 00:48:44,262
Look.

1348
00:48:45,192 --> 00:48:48,332
(He can't help but be amazed by its taste.)

1349
00:48:50,502 --> 00:48:51,631
Look.

1350
00:48:51,632 --> 00:48:53,472
(He takes a bite of the meaty hairtail first.)

1351
00:48:55,042 --> 00:48:57,442
(Then he eats the rice right away.)

1352
00:48:58,472 --> 00:49:01,912
(Smacking his lips)

1353
00:49:02,112 --> 00:49:03,751
- A good hairtail... - The sauce is amazing.

1354
00:49:03,752 --> 00:49:06,951
- tastes very flavorful. - Do you mean the sauce?

1355
00:49:06,952 --> 00:49:10,292
The flesh tastes flavorful as if it was covered in grease.

1356
00:49:11,022 --> 00:49:12,452
The sauce is amazing.

1357
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,761
- I want to mix rice into the sauce. - This is...

1358
00:49:15,762 --> 00:49:17,202
(I want to mix rice into the sauce.)

1359
00:49:17,292 --> 00:49:18,461
(It's so meaty.)

1360
00:49:18,462 --> 00:49:20,232
- Hey. - It's crazy.

1361
00:49:20,302 --> 00:49:21,701
For this one,

1362
00:49:21,702 --> 00:49:23,572
should we simply play rock-paper-scissors?

1363
00:49:23,702 --> 00:49:26,302
- For this one. - Come on.

1364
00:49:26,902 --> 00:49:28,942
- I'd love to. - We'll give you that.

1365
00:49:29,472 --> 00:49:31,912
(My goodness)

1366
00:49:31,972 --> 00:49:34,282
Don't let the flesh come off.

1367
00:49:34,542 --> 00:49:35,941
- It might fall off. - Let's play for that piece.

1368
00:49:35,942 --> 00:49:37,552
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1369
00:49:37,612 --> 00:49:38,651
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1370
00:49:38,652 --> 00:49:41,281
(Yi Kyung is eliminated.)

1371
00:49:41,282 --> 00:49:43,121
- Okay. - I really want to win.

1372
00:49:43,122 --> 00:49:44,251
(I really want to win.)

1373
00:49:44,252 --> 00:49:45,721
Ready or not,

1374
00:49:45,722 --> 00:49:46,861
rock-paper-scissors.

1375
00:49:46,862 --> 00:49:50,162
(Sang Uk won.)

1376
00:49:50,332 --> 00:49:51,531
It's just a bone.

1377
00:49:51,532 --> 00:49:53,561
(He freeloads on the fishbone.)

1378
00:49:53,562 --> 00:49:55,602
Take it with the fishbone.

1379
00:49:55,702 --> 00:49:56,771
That's right.

1380
00:49:56,772 --> 00:49:59,802
(Cat Sang Uk bones and eats the fish.)

1381
00:50:01,072 --> 00:50:02,242
The hairtail is really good.

1382
00:50:02,272 --> 00:50:04,572
(He envies him for having the fishbone.)

1383
00:50:04,942 --> 00:50:09,541
(He meticulously takes the flesh off the bone.)

1384
00:50:09,542 --> 00:50:10,752
Some might see him and say...

1385
00:50:10,852 --> 00:50:12,481
This is a really good restaurant.

1386
00:50:12,482 --> 00:50:14,222
(This is a really good restaurant.)

1387
00:50:14,322 --> 00:50:16,451
Of everything I've eaten,

1388
00:50:16,452 --> 00:50:18,721
this is the most delicious meal.

1389
00:50:18,722 --> 00:50:19,751
(This place is the best.)

1390
00:50:19,752 --> 00:50:21,562
Should we ask for the bill?

1391
00:50:22,692 --> 00:50:23,931
- About 240 dollars? - It must easily be 200 dollars.

1392
00:50:23,932 --> 00:50:25,631
- Hold on. - It must be expensive.

1393
00:50:25,632 --> 00:50:28,102
The difference is less than 50 dollars.

1394
00:50:28,202 --> 00:50:30,501
- It must be about 250 dollars. - It's 268 dollars.

1395
00:50:30,502 --> 00:50:31,831
Yes. It would cost that much.

1396
00:50:31,832 --> 00:50:32,871
Is it 260 dollars?

1397
00:50:32,872 --> 00:50:34,401
It's worth the money, though.

1398
00:50:34,402 --> 00:50:36,302
- It'd cost that much. - Yes, it would.

1399
00:50:36,402 --> 00:50:37,971
Now, I'll give you the quiz for the set meal...

1400
00:50:37,972 --> 00:50:39,542
of the South Jeolla Province.

1401
00:50:39,712 --> 00:50:41,711
The octopus horongyi, the seasoned octopus skewer,

1402
00:50:41,712 --> 00:50:44,652
is the octopus rolled around a wooden chopstick and grilled.

1403
00:50:44,882 --> 00:50:48,251
The name came from horong, which is not a wooden chopstick,

1404
00:50:48,252 --> 00:50:51,191
that was used to stick the octopus...

1405
00:50:51,192 --> 00:50:53,352
to grill it.

1406
00:50:53,662 --> 00:50:55,292
Then what is this "horong?"

1407
00:50:55,422 --> 00:50:57,692
Gosh. It's so easy.

1408
00:50:57,832 --> 00:50:59,352
Do you want me to tell you the answer?

1409
00:50:59,462 --> 00:51:00,462
Yes. I beg you.

1410
00:51:00,463 --> 00:51:02,662
We call our fencing swords "horong."

1411
00:51:02,832 --> 00:51:04,132
- Really? - Yes, really.

1412
00:51:04,332 --> 00:51:05,771
They wouldn't skewer a fencing sword through an octopus.

1413
00:51:05,772 --> 00:51:07,001
We really call our swords "horong."

1414
00:51:07,002 --> 00:51:08,672
You gave them such a huge hint.

1415
00:51:08,802 --> 00:51:09,841
- Why? - It's called horong.

1416
00:51:09,842 --> 00:51:11,688
Why would they call it horong? Where is the word from?

1417
00:51:11,712 --> 00:51:13,612
Isn't that horong, Tae Hyun?

1418
00:51:13,742 --> 00:51:14,812
The kerosene lamp.

1419
00:51:15,142 --> 00:51:16,858
The old kerosene lamp was called horong light.

1420
00:51:16,882 --> 00:51:18,612
The candlestick.

1421
00:51:19,152 --> 00:51:20,558
Do you think the candlestick is the answer??

1422
00:51:20,582 --> 00:51:22,281
They called kerosene lamp the horong lamp before.

1423
00:51:22,282 --> 00:51:24,422
- Yes. - They used the candlestick.

1424
00:51:25,152 --> 00:51:27,562
The kerosene lamp.

1425
00:51:28,392 --> 00:51:30,232
Should I ask the AI assistant about it?

1426
00:51:31,492 --> 00:51:32,662
It'd answer you right away.

1427
00:51:32,832 --> 00:51:34,262
I'm glad I didn't say it before.

1428
00:51:34,462 --> 00:51:36,622
When I typed in "horong," it gives me a fencing sword.

1429
00:51:37,572 --> 00:51:38,731
- I'm serious. - It's true.

1430
00:51:38,732 --> 00:51:39,732
(They are lying.)

1431
00:51:39,733 --> 00:51:40,901
- Look. It's a fencing sword. - You're right.

1432
00:51:40,902 --> 00:51:41,902
(They are lying.)

1433
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:43,942
That could be a hint.

1434
00:51:44,812 --> 00:51:46,242
Tae Hyun, that's a hint.

1435
00:51:46,672 --> 00:51:47,981
Is it a type of knife?

1436
00:51:47,982 --> 00:51:50,082
(Is it a type of knife?)

1437
00:51:50,382 --> 00:51:52,852
Amazing. Don't give them any more hints.

1438
00:51:53,852 --> 00:51:55,151
- It's a hint. - No, it's not.

1439
00:51:55,152 --> 00:51:56,152
(They bit the bait.)

1440
00:51:56,153 --> 00:51:57,291
When we have me in our team,

1441
00:51:57,292 --> 00:51:59,022
they have Sang Uk in their team.

1442
00:51:59,522 --> 00:52:01,662
- A knife. - Gosh.

1443
00:52:02,462 --> 00:52:05,062
- Tae Hyun, follow your guts. - It's 100 percent a fencing sword.

1444
00:52:05,232 --> 00:52:06,931
- Let's go with the candlestick. - The candlestick?

1445
00:52:06,932 --> 00:52:07,962
Okay. Let's go.

1446
00:52:08,232 --> 00:52:09,232
It's been a while...

1447
00:52:09,233 --> 00:52:10,878
- since Tae Hyun had a hunch. - He has the hunch.

1448
00:52:10,902 --> 00:52:11,902
We got it.

1449
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,971
(Candlestick)

1450
00:52:12,972 --> 00:52:14,002
A candlestick.

1451
00:52:15,942 --> 00:52:16,942
It's...

1452
00:52:17,472 --> 00:52:18,832
- incorrect. - For goodness' sake.

1453
00:52:18,912 --> 00:52:20,242
Since it's over for them...

1454
00:52:20,742 --> 00:52:21,812
For goodness' sake.

1455
00:52:21,942 --> 00:52:24,581
Since it's over for them, tell us the answer.

1456
00:52:24,582 --> 00:52:25,612
(We want the answer.)

1457
00:52:25,812 --> 00:52:27,652
The answer is the rice straw.

1458
00:52:28,122 --> 00:52:29,528
I didn't consider the rice straw at all.

1459
00:52:29,552 --> 00:52:30,828
Did they roll it around the rice straw?

1460
00:52:30,852 --> 00:52:34,061
They twisted the rice straws.

1461
00:52:34,062 --> 00:52:35,191
Then they wrapped the octopus around it.

1462
00:52:35,192 --> 00:52:36,822
- It was so hard. - I see. That was it.

1463
00:52:37,392 --> 00:52:38,568
- Okay. - Go for the individual match.

1464
00:52:38,592 --> 00:52:40,272
- Let's go. - The individual match, it is.

1465
00:52:40,332 --> 00:52:42,331
If Dong Hyun pays for this, he spends over 500 dollars.

1466
00:52:42,332 --> 00:52:43,362
It's about 600 dollars.

1467
00:52:43,802 --> 00:52:46,401
- My wife will yell at me. - He can pay for dinner too.

1468
00:52:46,402 --> 00:52:48,302
On the menu of Korean dishes,

1469
00:52:48,402 --> 00:52:50,341
there are often mistranslated dishes...

1470
00:52:50,342 --> 00:52:53,341
that can confuse foreigners.

1471
00:52:53,342 --> 00:52:54,342
The English translations.

1472
00:52:54,582 --> 00:52:57,151
The well-known case was the addictive kimbap,

1473
00:52:57,152 --> 00:52:59,351
which was translated as "drug kimbap."

1474
00:52:59,352 --> 00:53:00,382
That's right.

1475
00:53:00,722 --> 00:53:01,722
That's true.

1476
00:53:01,723 --> 00:53:03,892
In that case, what would be the dish...

1477
00:53:04,322 --> 00:53:06,321
that was mistranslated as "massage pork?"

1478
00:53:06,322 --> 00:53:07,562
- "Massage..." - Pork.

1479
00:53:08,222 --> 00:53:09,861
- Pork? - Pork.

1480
00:53:09,862 --> 00:53:11,532
- Fork. - You're right.

1481
00:53:12,292 --> 00:53:13,391
- I have to get it right. - That massage.

1482
00:53:13,392 --> 00:53:14,431
"Massage pork."

1483
00:53:14,432 --> 00:53:15,462
That sounds about right.

1484
00:53:16,062 --> 00:53:17,901
(He has no idea.)

1485
00:53:17,902 --> 00:53:18,902
Pork. Fork.

1486
00:53:18,903 --> 00:53:20,401
(Eureka!)

1487
00:53:20,402 --> 00:53:22,801
- That sounds about right. - "Massage."

1488
00:53:22,802 --> 00:53:23,912
I got it.

1489
00:53:24,042 --> 00:53:25,271
I think Yi Kyung and I are in sync.

1490
00:53:25,272 --> 00:53:26,272
(Sharing the answer)

1491
00:53:26,572 --> 00:53:28,181
(You're right!)

1492
00:53:28,182 --> 00:53:29,611
- I'm correct. - That must be the answer.

1493
00:53:29,612 --> 00:53:31,982
- Is it correct? - Yes. That's it.

1494
00:53:32,082 --> 00:53:33,511
Yi Kyung and I are on the same page.

1495
00:53:33,512 --> 00:53:34,898
(They all know the answer already.)

1496
00:53:34,922 --> 00:53:36,682
- Let's keep quiet about it. - By the way...

1497
00:53:37,152 --> 00:53:38,852
- I got it. - Tae Hyun.

1498
00:53:39,922 --> 00:53:41,722
- Pork ribs? - "Pork ribs?"

1499
00:53:42,022 --> 00:53:43,192
- We got it. - Is it correct?

1500
00:53:43,422 --> 00:53:44,542
- That's right. - Incorrect.

1501
00:53:45,092 --> 00:53:46,132
- What? - Incorrect.

1502
00:53:47,302 --> 00:53:48,331
You get this one.

1503
00:53:48,332 --> 00:53:49,902
By the way,

1504
00:53:50,432 --> 00:53:52,302
they are so good.

1505
00:53:52,702 --> 00:53:53,902
How do they know it?

1506
00:53:54,002 --> 00:53:55,002
I got it.

1507
00:53:55,602 --> 00:53:56,641
- No way. - Dong Hyun.

1508
00:53:56,642 --> 00:53:58,141
Is it marinated pork?

1509
00:53:58,142 --> 00:54:00,042
- That's right. - The marinated pork?

1510
00:54:00,742 --> 00:54:02,241
- The marinated pork? - We massage the sauce into it.

1511
00:54:02,242 --> 00:54:03,242
You're right.

1512
00:54:04,152 --> 00:54:05,152
Correct.

1513
00:54:05,452 --> 00:54:07,281
It's the marinated pork.

1514
00:54:07,282 --> 00:54:09,182
I thought it was about "fork."

1515
00:54:09,282 --> 00:54:10,852
So I wondered what that fork would be.

1516
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:13,252
- Dong Hyun, that was nice. - I'm relieved.

1517
00:54:13,622 --> 00:54:14,662
I broke the curse.

1518
00:54:15,162 --> 00:54:18,091
I broke the chain of the evil cycle.

1519
00:54:18,092 --> 00:54:19,092
- Gosh. - Okay.

- The sun is setting. - Yes.

1530

Do you know where that is?

1531
00:54:48,322 --> 00:54:50,462
- Changdeokgung Palace? - What?

1532
00:54:50,762 --> 00:54:51,961
- Gyeongbokgung Palace? - It's Gyeongbokgung Palace.

1533
00:54:51,962 --> 00:54:53,842
- What did you say? - Why Changdeokgung Palace?

1534
00:54:54,102 --> 00:54:55,931
We're next to Gyeongbokgung Palace.

1535
00:54:55,932 --> 00:54:59,301
It's a perfect date course during the autumn.

1536
00:54:59,302 --> 00:55:00,472
It's packed with people.

1537
00:55:00,542 --> 00:55:03,141
(What is the DMR here?)

1538
00:55:03,142 --> 00:55:04,442
I heard...

1539
00:55:05,512 --> 00:55:07,018
that someone was talking about hot pot.

1540
00:55:07,042 --> 00:55:09,612
I have the hot pot at least once every week.

1541
00:55:09,942 --> 00:55:12,851
I heard there was hot pot featured in "Culinary Class Wars."

1542
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:14,151
Right. It's near here.

1543
00:55:14,152 --> 00:55:15,651
- It was on "Culinary Class Wars." - I don't know about it.

1544
00:55:15,652 --> 00:55:16,881
There's a hot pot from "Culinary Class Wars."

1545
00:55:16,882 --> 00:55:18,992
Then we have to wait six months.

1546
00:55:19,452 --> 00:55:21,391
Do we get to have it in six months?

1547
00:55:21,392 --> 00:55:22,792
No, it's...

1548
00:55:22,992 --> 00:55:25,032
We must be able to visit it.

1549
00:55:25,562 --> 00:55:27,601
- I love hot pot so much. - Hot pot?

1550
00:55:27,602 --> 00:55:29,102
We're in Buam-dong.

1551
00:55:29,632 --> 00:55:31,272
You know about its famous chicken, right?

1552
00:55:31,372 --> 00:55:32,832
- I don't. - You have no idea.

1553
00:55:32,902 --> 00:55:34,541
Isn't it 1 of the top 3 chicken places?

1554
00:55:34,542 --> 00:55:36,442
Is it an old-school fried chicken?

1555
00:55:36,802 --> 00:55:38,111
It's 1 of the top 3 chicken places in Seoul.

1556
00:55:38,112 --> 00:55:39,171
- Top 3 chickens? - It is top 3.

1557
00:55:39,172 --> 00:55:40,641
- It's one of them. - Is it?

1558
00:55:40,642 --> 00:55:41,881
One of them is Buam-dong's chicken.

1559
00:55:41,882 --> 00:55:44,111
I should try it if it's Top Three.

1560
00:55:44,112 --> 00:55:45,552
Why is it Top Three?

1561
00:55:45,652 --> 00:55:47,498
- If you want to find out, - I want to find out.

1562
00:55:47,522 --> 00:55:49,122
- follow me. - Seriously.

1563
00:55:49,382 --> 00:55:51,228
- Top Three? - Follow me if you want to find out.

1564
00:55:51,252 --> 00:55:52,521
- Top Three chicken? - Hold on.

1565
00:55:52,522 --> 00:55:54,261
Do none of you want hot pot?

1566
00:55:54,262 --> 00:55:55,321
- I want hot pot. - Hot pot?

1567
00:55:55,322 --> 00:55:56,391
- I want hot pot. - Me too.

1568
00:55:56,392 --> 00:55:58,152
Hot pot? What about chicken with draft beer?

1569
00:55:58,792 --> 00:56:00,501
I can't give that up. That's the best combo.

1570
00:56:00,502 --> 00:56:02,561
We're in Buam-dong where 1 of the top 3 chickens is.

1571
00:56:02,562 --> 00:56:04,471
- Are you going to skip it? - I'm curious about it, indeed.

1575
00:56:08,802 --> 00:56:10,518
- Have you picked one? - I'll choose the chicken.

1576
00:56:10,542 --> 00:56:11,872
- What? - Stand over here, then.

1577
00:56:12,112 --> 00:56:13,112
Why?

Okay. I'll take a bite of the chicken later.

1585
00:56:24,822 --> 00:56:26,568
I'll have it and go to bed. I'll pick hot pot today.

1586
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:27,892
- I see. - Okay.

1587
00:56:27,962 --> 00:56:29,361
- You imagined your whole day. - Yes.

1588
00:56:29,362 --> 00:56:30,362
Okay.

1589
00:56:30,363 --> 00:56:31,531
(So, today's DMR is...)

1590
00:56:31,532 --> 00:56:33,761
(Dinner Menu Recommendation)

1591
00:56:33,762 --> 00:56:35,001
- Okay, today... - Seung Ho,

1592
00:56:35,002 --> 00:56:36,501
Dong Hyun, and Sang Uk will have hot pot.

1593
00:56:36,502 --> 00:56:39,178
- Let's have the hot pot first. - Tae Hyun and I will have chicken.

1594
00:56:39,202 --> 00:56:40,541
Dinner in Seochon.

1595
00:56:40,542 --> 00:56:41,941
(Which menu will they have first?)

1596
00:56:41,942 --> 00:56:43,502
- We'll have the hot pot first. - Okay.

1597
00:56:43,672 --> 00:56:45,141
- See? - Good.

1598
00:56:45,142 --> 00:56:46,712
- It's better to have it later. - What?

1599
00:56:46,772 --> 00:56:47,881
- Hold on. - I love it.

1600
00:56:47,882 --> 00:56:49,081
I want to have it later.

1601
00:56:49,082 --> 00:56:50,751
Gosh. You look so stupid.

1602
00:56:50,752 --> 00:56:51,752
Gosh. I'm full.

1603
00:56:51,753 --> 00:56:53,211
- You wanted to have it later. - What?

1604
00:56:53,212 --> 00:56:54,752
- You said that. - Exactly.

1605
00:56:54,882 --> 00:56:55,882
I'm full.

1606
00:56:55,883 --> 00:56:57,292
It's better to eat later.

1607
00:56:58,792 --> 00:57:00,891
It's so pretty now that the sun is setting.

1608
00:57:00,892 --> 00:57:03,021
Yes. I'm glad the days have gotten longer.

1609
00:57:03,022 --> 00:57:04,132
It's getting cool.

1610
00:57:04,692 --> 00:57:08,102
Aren't the places we've gone to so pretty?

1611
00:57:08,132 --> 00:57:09,132
You're right.

1612
00:57:09,133 --> 00:57:11,271
- Right. Many galleries are here. - Yes.

1613
00:57:11,272 --> 00:57:13,431
- It's so... - It's so pretty here.

1614
00:57:13,432 --> 00:57:15,271
- This place is pretty. - I've never been here.

1615
00:57:15,272 --> 00:57:16,371
(The past and the present coexist in the narrow alleyways in Seochon.)

1616
00:57:16,372 --> 00:57:17,672
I can smell something.

1617
00:57:19,542 --> 00:57:20,782
It smells like hot pot.

1618
00:57:20,942 --> 00:57:22,302
- What? - Hot pot and dongpo pork.

1619
00:57:22,882 --> 00:57:24,988
- I don't want dongpo pork. - I can smell the spices.

1620
00:57:25,012 --> 00:57:27,281
No dongpo pork? We have to have it.

1621
00:57:27,282 --> 00:57:29,121
- He doesn't want it. - Don't have it, then.

1622
00:57:29,122 --> 00:57:30,791
Sang Uk and I will have it.

1623
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:32,822
- Hot pot and dongpo pork. - It must be here.

1624
00:57:32,952 --> 00:57:34,152
I think I've been here before.

1625
00:57:34,662 --> 00:57:36,161
Is this the place...

1626
00:57:36,162 --> 00:57:37,461
- run by that guy... - It has a nice vibe.

1627
00:57:37,462 --> 00:57:39,238
- It looks like China. - from "Culinary Class Wars?"

1628
00:57:39,262 --> 00:57:41,501
I think I've seen this place on TV.

1629
00:57:41,502 --> 00:57:42,531
Is it run by that guy?

1630
00:57:42,532 --> 00:57:44,102
- Hey. - Iron Bag Chef?

1631
00:57:45,158 --> 00:57:46,158
- "Culinary Class Wars?" - Really?

1632
00:57:46,159 --> 00:57:48,327
I think I've seen this place on TV.

1633
00:57:48,328 --> 00:57:49,328
Is it run by that guy?

1634
00:57:49,358 --> 00:57:50,928
- Hey. - Iron Bag Chef?

1635
00:57:52,398 --> 00:57:54,367
(The Chinese cuisine's new dark horse...)

1636
00:57:54,368 --> 00:57:55,727
(who made his name known with his dongpo pork...)

1637
00:57:55,728 --> 00:57:57,128
(in "Culinary Class Wars.")

1638
00:57:57,398 --> 00:58:00,138
(The restaurant run by Iron Bag Chef)

1639
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:04,438
(It's impossible to make a reservation.)

1640
00:58:05,138 --> 00:58:06,577
(The customers keep rushing in.)

1641
00:58:06,578 --> 00:58:08,707
(There's always a line before it opens.)

1642
00:58:08,708 --> 00:58:10,207
(The waitlist for the walk-ins finishes early...)

1643
00:58:10,208 --> 00:58:11,548
(because so many people come.)

1644
00:58:12,148 --> 00:58:13,378
We've come to the right place.

1645
00:58:13,848 --> 00:58:15,517
Isn't it the famous place?

1646
00:58:15,518 --> 00:58:16,518
(DMR 1: Hot pot)

1647
00:58:17,148 --> 00:58:18,558
At this place,

1648
00:58:19,058 --> 00:58:20,657
we can already tell it'll be delicious by the decor.

1649
00:58:20,658 --> 00:58:22,634
Should we order three servings of the dongpo pork?

1650
00:58:22,658 --> 00:58:23,688
Three?

1651
00:58:24,258 --> 00:58:26,198
This place is known for its dongpo pork.

1652
00:58:26,298 --> 00:58:28,097
It's dongpo pork, not burgers.

1653
00:58:28,098 --> 00:58:30,938
Its jjamppong and jjajangmyeon must be amazing too.

1654
00:58:31,438 --> 00:58:33,097
- I'm glad we're here. - Jjamppong.

1655
00:58:33,098 --> 00:58:34,644
When we have jjamppong after dongpo pork...

1656
00:58:34,668 --> 00:58:36,268
We'll order hot pot too.

1657
00:58:36,408 --> 00:58:37,678
We have to order hot pot.

1658
00:58:38,008 --> 00:58:40,478
Gosh. I'm so full now, so...

1659
00:58:40,878 --> 00:58:42,477
Order as if only two of you were here.

1660
00:58:42,478 --> 00:58:44,147
That would be enough for me.

1661
00:58:44,148 --> 00:58:45,148
Okay.

1662
00:58:45,149 --> 00:58:46,248
- Sir. - Sir.

1663
00:58:47,588 --> 00:58:48,588
Okay.
(Manager Im Tae Bin)

1664
00:58:49,589 --> 00:58:51,518
Sir, first, we'll order the hot pot...

1665
00:58:51,988 --> 00:58:53,488
- with three types of broths. - Okay.

1666
00:58:53,658 --> 00:58:54,757
Should we share one jjajangmyeon?

1667
00:58:54,758 --> 00:58:56,057
Are you going to have jjajangmyeon after having the hot pot?

1668
00:58:56,058 --> 00:58:57,828
We'll order it after finishing the hot pot.

1669
00:58:58,128 --> 00:58:59,357
But when we think about it,

1670
00:58:59,358 --> 00:59:01,478
you just had the dishes of the South Jeolla Province.

1671
00:59:01,668 --> 00:59:02,867
These two must be hungry.

1672
00:59:02,868 --> 00:59:05,297
- But the difference is 1 hour. - There was a 1-hour difference.

1673
00:59:05,298 --> 00:59:07,738
- Can you let us talk? - It's a serious conversation.

1674
00:59:08,968 --> 00:59:10,838
(I shouldn't have said it.)

1675
00:59:11,138 --> 00:59:14,107
What is the most popular signature dish of this place?

1676
00:59:14,108 --> 00:59:15,788
- It's the dongpo pork. - The dongpo pork.

1677
00:59:15,878 --> 00:59:17,177
Is it the one on the show?

1678
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:18,217
Yes.

1679
00:59:18,218 --> 00:59:20,017
- We have to have it. - And the fish-fragrant eggplant.

1680
00:59:20,018 --> 00:59:21,047
Are you done with the order?

1681
00:59:21,048 --> 00:59:22,517
Let's order the fish-fragrant eggplant...

1682
00:59:22,518 --> 00:59:24,394
even if we can't have jjajangmyeon and jjamppong.

1683
00:59:24,418 --> 00:59:26,387
- We'll order the eggplant too. - Please add it.

1684
00:59:26,388 --> 00:59:28,657
- The fish-fragrant eggplant. Okay. - But this place...

1685
00:59:28,658 --> 00:59:30,527
It'll be hard to have them unless you have them today.

1686
00:59:30,528 --> 00:59:31,528
- Is that so? - Yes.

1687
00:59:31,529 --> 00:59:33,734
You can have the meat first and finish off with the hot pot.

1688
00:59:33,758 --> 00:59:34,797
Sounds good.

1689
00:59:34,798 --> 00:59:36,027
- Lovely. - You can serve...

1690
00:59:36,028 --> 00:59:37,837
- whatever is ready first. - Okay.

1691
00:59:37,838 --> 00:59:38,938
It's crazy.

1692
00:59:39,798 --> 00:59:41,567
I regret it a little now.

1693
00:59:41,568 --> 00:59:42,768
Can you hear the frying sound?

1694
00:59:45,708 --> 00:59:47,178
- Can you hear it? - Yes, I can.

1695
00:59:47,448 --> 00:59:49,578
In a way,

1696
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:51,647
including the chicken,

1697
00:59:51,648 --> 00:59:54,618
Dinner at Buam-dong is like the battle of fried food.

1698
00:59:55,318 --> 00:59:57,217
I love Chinese food so much.

1699
00:59:57,218 --> 00:59:59,778
- It's my absolute favorite. - Yes. You talked about it earlier.

1700
01:00:00,288 --> 01:00:01,727
- Seriously. - The food is here.

1701
01:00:01,728 --> 01:00:03,258
I was so hungry. Seriously.

1702
01:00:03,758 --> 01:00:05,297
It's here.

1703
01:00:05,298 --> 01:00:06,327
- Dongpo pork. - Dongpo pork.

1704
01:00:06,328 --> 01:00:07,428
(The food is here.)

1705
01:00:08,428 --> 01:00:09,827
- Is this it? - Oh, my.

1706
01:00:09,828 --> 01:00:10,898
Look how thick it is.

1707
01:00:11,068 --> 01:00:14,507
- It's served with bok choy. - The meat breaks when you touch it.

1708
01:00:14,508 --> 01:00:15,907
There are six pieces.

1709
01:00:15,908 --> 01:00:18,507
Let me give you an explanation on this dish, dongpo pork.

1710
01:00:18,508 --> 01:00:21,007
The preparations and cooking took...

1711
01:00:21,008 --> 01:00:23,078
over eight hours.

1712
01:00:23,308 --> 01:00:25,117
I recommend that you cut it horizontally...

1713
01:00:25,118 --> 01:00:26,847
- so that it goes against the grain. - Okay.

1714
01:00:26,848 --> 01:00:28,347
You should eat...

1715
01:00:28,348 --> 01:00:30,917
the fat, meat, and bok choy together.

1716
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:32,617
We don't give you tongs...

1717
01:00:32,618 --> 01:00:33,757
because they'll break the meat.

1718
01:00:33,758 --> 01:00:35,558
- I see. - That's right. They break the meat.

1719
01:00:35,828 --> 01:00:37,927
For the best taste, how many parts should I divide it into?

1720
01:00:37,928 --> 01:00:40,168
- I think you should halve it. - That's right. Halve it.

1721
01:00:40,298 --> 01:00:41,468
It smells so nice.

1722
01:00:42,168 --> 01:00:43,497
- Please cut it prettily. - Of course.

1723
01:00:43,498 --> 01:00:45,068
Gosh, this is my specialty.

1724
01:00:45,198 --> 01:00:48,167
When I was an MMA fighter, I had to do this for the seniors.

1725
01:00:48,168 --> 01:00:49,237
(He cuts the meat in half against the grain as he learned!)

1726
01:00:49,238 --> 01:00:50,508
- There you go. - Yes.

1727
01:00:51,778 --> 01:00:52,838
There you go.

1728
01:00:53,878 --> 01:00:54,977
- There you go. - For the rest, eat one each.

1729
01:00:54,978 --> 01:00:56,277
- Eat one each. - You can stop cutting now.

1730
01:00:56,278 --> 01:00:57,407
You can stop cutting now.

1731
01:00:57,408 --> 01:00:58,547
- Why? - Dong Hyun,

1732
01:00:58,548 --> 01:00:59,847
- eat this piece. - It'll break if you touch it.

1733
01:00:59,848 --> 01:01:02,047
Don't cut all the pieces. Just cut the pieces you'll eat.

1734
01:01:02,048 --> 01:01:03,147
That sounds good.

1735
01:01:03,148 --> 01:01:05,157
It'll break if you pick it up with chopsticks.

1736
01:01:05,158 --> 01:01:06,387
(Careful)

1737
01:01:06,388 --> 01:01:07,928
You treat the meat with care.

1738
01:01:08,758 --> 01:01:10,487
- Gosh, what's this? - What?

1739
01:01:10,488 --> 01:01:11,697
There's mushroom underneath.

1740
01:01:11,698 --> 01:01:13,628
- It's tasty with bok choy. - Bok choy.

1741
01:01:14,028 --> 01:01:15,068
Bok choy.

1742
01:01:16,198 --> 01:01:17,198
Bok choy.

1743
01:01:21,238 --> 01:01:22,567
(Impressed)

1744
01:01:22,568 --> 01:01:25,237
- All right. - Is there space in your stomach?

1745
01:01:25,238 --> 01:01:27,238
Yes. There's a bit of space now.

1746
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:28,447
A little bit.

1747
01:01:28,448 --> 01:01:30,647
- All right. - I don't often eat...

1748
01:01:30,648 --> 01:01:32,547
- dongpo pork. Only meat? - Eat only meat first.

1749
01:01:32,548 --> 01:01:33,647
It disappears when you put it in your mouth.

1750
01:01:33,648 --> 01:01:36,448
Why haven't I tried dongpo pork?

1751
01:01:36,888 --> 01:01:37,988
Dongpo pork is...

1752
01:01:38,488 --> 01:01:39,818
- Eat bok choy too. - It's tasty.

1753
01:01:40,118 --> 01:01:43,557
(The man who had no interest in dongpo pork, Dong Hyun eats it.)

1754
01:01:43,558 --> 01:01:45,258
It'll open up your stomach.

1755
01:01:46,128 --> 01:01:47,927
- Gosh, I love bok choy. - It disappears in your mouth.

1756
01:01:47,928 --> 01:01:49,488
I love that he brought out the texture.

1757
01:01:49,528 --> 01:01:50,628
Is it that good?

1758
01:01:51,138 --> 01:01:53,837
- As I chewed it, hunger hit me. - Hunger.

1759
01:01:53,838 --> 01:01:55,038
Hunger hit me.

1760
01:01:56,768 --> 01:01:59,108
Hunger suddenly hit me. It stimulated my appetite.

1761
01:01:59,338 --> 01:02:00,607
- That's right. - My mouth is watering.

1762
01:02:00,608 --> 01:02:02,208
- Gosh! - It's really tasty.

1763
01:02:03,048 --> 01:02:04,317
Hunger suddenly hit me.

1764
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:05,418
It stimulated my appetite.

1765
01:02:05,578 --> 01:02:06,947
- That's right. - My mouth is watering.

1766
01:02:06,948 --> 01:02:07,988
(Gosh!)

1767
01:02:09,748 --> 01:02:10,958
I'm full,

1768
01:02:11,318 --> 01:02:12,988
but my mouth is watering. What's this?

1769
01:02:14,058 --> 01:02:15,058
What's this?

1770
01:02:15,088 --> 01:02:17,058
When I had dongpo pork someplace else,

1771
01:02:17,698 --> 01:02:21,127
I didn't like it because of the smell of the fat.

1772
01:02:21,128 --> 01:02:22,697
- I see. - But when I bit into it...

1773
01:02:22,698 --> 01:02:24,097
- So you weren't enthused. - No.

1774
01:02:24,098 --> 01:02:26,967
But the fat disappears...

1775
01:02:26,968 --> 01:02:28,537
- and leaves the meat behind. - Really?

1776
01:02:28,538 --> 01:02:29,608
I can only chew the meat.

1777
01:02:30,338 --> 01:02:31,507
It's salty.

1778
01:02:31,508 --> 01:02:33,237
- This is... - Gosh, it's tasty.

1779
01:02:33,238 --> 01:02:35,578
- This is driving me crazy. - It's tasty.

1780
01:02:36,178 --> 01:02:39,078
Dong Hyun, the flavors are insane.

1781
01:02:39,148 --> 01:02:40,477
Seriously.

1782
01:02:40,478 --> 01:02:42,917
It's my first time eating dongpo pork that breaks upon touch.

1783
01:02:42,918 --> 01:02:44,817
It breaks so easily that you can't even touch it.

1784
01:02:44,818 --> 01:02:46,988
How did he cook it and plate it?

1785
01:02:47,458 --> 01:02:49,157
- That takes technique. - Yes.

1786
01:02:49,158 --> 01:02:50,718
- That's technique. - That's technique.

1787
01:02:51,028 --> 01:02:53,397
I really don't like the dish,

1788
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:54,927
but this one will be memorable.

1789
01:02:54,928 --> 01:02:57,098
It's hard to believe that you don't like the dish.

1790
01:02:58,098 --> 01:02:59,768
Dongpo pork is no joke. Seriously.

1791
01:03:00,638 --> 01:03:02,437
Although there's no rice.

1792
01:03:02,438 --> 01:03:04,777
It isn't too salty or anything.

1793
01:03:04,778 --> 01:03:05,807
- Not at all. - I could eat it endlessly.

1794
01:03:05,808 --> 01:03:07,528
- Not at all. - I love that it isn't salty.

1795
01:03:07,848 --> 01:03:09,307
But eating it with rice...

1796
01:03:09,308 --> 01:03:10,448
would be lovely.

1797
01:03:12,848 --> 01:03:17,688
(Thanks to the dongpo pork, his stomach becomes empty again.)

1798
01:03:17,918 --> 01:03:19,387
Dong Hyun, you said that you didn't like dongpo pork.

1799
01:03:19,388 --> 01:03:20,858
It looks like his stomach opened up.

1800
01:03:22,488 --> 01:03:24,958
Dong Hyun, didn't you eat earlier?

1801
01:03:26,828 --> 01:03:28,027
His stomach opened up.

1802
01:03:28,028 --> 01:03:29,567
(The path from the throat to the stomach is totally open.)

1803
01:03:29,568 --> 01:03:30,568
It's insane.

1804
01:03:30,968 --> 01:03:31,998
It's tasty.

1805
01:03:33,498 --> 01:03:35,238
This makes me want a bowl of jjamppong.

1806
01:03:36,538 --> 01:03:37,538
Shall we order jjamppong?

1807
01:03:37,539 --> 01:03:39,608
Why would you order jjamppong? Don't do that.

1808
01:03:39,678 --> 01:03:40,807
- Let's eat the other dishes first. - Do that.

1809
01:03:40,808 --> 01:03:42,477
- Okay. - Order it if you still want it.

1810
01:03:42,478 --> 01:03:44,978
I decided to think like them.

1811
01:03:45,218 --> 01:03:46,478
When he mentioned jjamppong,

1812
01:03:46,848 --> 01:03:48,818
I wondered, "How does their jjamppong taste?"

1813
01:03:49,688 --> 01:03:50,988
"It must taste different."

1814
01:03:51,588 --> 01:03:52,718
Here comes another dish.

1815
01:03:52,788 --> 01:03:53,957
If you taste the dishes here,

1816
01:03:53,958 --> 01:03:55,857
- you'll be too full for later. - The timing is perfect.

1817
01:03:55,858 --> 01:03:56,858
My goodness.

1818
01:03:57,288 --> 01:03:58,357
What's that?

1819
01:03:58,358 --> 01:04:00,557
It's fried fish-fragrant eggplant.

1820
01:04:00,558 --> 01:04:02,728
They look like dumplings.

1821
01:04:04,098 --> 01:04:05,378
I haven't seen anything like it.

1822
01:04:05,598 --> 01:04:06,737
Is that how the dish usually looks?

1823
01:04:06,738 --> 01:04:07,978
- What's that? - It's the best.

1824
01:04:08,708 --> 01:04:10,908
- What? They look like toads. - What's this?

1825
01:04:11,538 --> 01:04:14,778
(Minced shrimp goes inside the eggplant.)

1826
01:04:15,678 --> 01:04:21,518
(Then it gets coated in batter and fried so that it's juicy.)

1827
01:04:23,088 --> 01:04:25,387
(Then the pieces get placed on a special sauce...)

1828
01:04:25,388 --> 01:04:27,688
(to complete the fish-fragrant eggplant.)

1829
01:04:28,058 --> 01:04:29,257
It's a must-order dish.

1830
01:04:29,258 --> 01:04:32,057
Sir, you should've recommended the dish with enthusiasm.

1831
01:04:32,058 --> 01:04:33,828
- Okay. - We almost didn't order it.

1832
01:04:33,928 --> 01:04:35,697
- What would we have done then? - Hurry up.

1833
01:04:35,698 --> 01:04:37,698
I'll cut it. I'm an expert.

1834
01:04:39,898 --> 01:04:40,898
(Tapping)

1835
01:04:41,468 --> 01:04:43,037
- It's nice and hard. - Hold on.

1836
01:04:43,038 --> 01:04:44,337
Why did you knock on it?

1837
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:46,377
I checked if the outside was crispy.

1838
01:04:46,378 --> 01:04:48,407
- Crispy outside and moist inside. - Crispy outside.

1839
01:04:48,408 --> 01:04:49,607
(He checked if the outside was crispy.)

1840
01:04:49,608 --> 01:04:50,947
I can't wait to see the center.

1841
01:04:50,948 --> 01:04:51,978
Hold on.

1842
01:04:52,448 --> 01:04:53,518
I need to cut it quickly.

1843
01:04:55,148 --> 01:04:56,547
(The inside is full of shrimp.)

1844
01:04:56,548 --> 01:04:58,358
- What is it? - Show the cross section.

1845
01:04:59,358 --> 01:05:00,388
Hold on.

1846
01:05:00,618 --> 01:05:02,658
(Impressed)

1847
01:05:03,628 --> 01:05:05,397
- Hold on. - This is it.

1848
01:05:05,398 --> 01:05:06,858
- It's shrimp. - Yes.

1849
01:05:07,698 --> 01:05:08,698
- It's insane. - I'm sorry,

1850
01:05:08,699 --> 01:05:10,259
- but can you cut the next one? - Okay.

1851
01:05:10,398 --> 01:05:12,937
- You need to cut it like this. - That's right.

1852
01:05:12,938 --> 01:05:14,707
I was watching to see if you'd do it.

1853
01:05:14,708 --> 01:05:16,107
- Is that how you cut it? - You're the best.

1854
01:05:16,108 --> 01:05:17,808
It's a basic skill.

1855
01:05:18,538 --> 01:05:20,777
- You have my respect. - I ate with the seniors so often.

1856
01:05:20,778 --> 01:05:22,477
- You should stop now. - Why?

1857
01:05:22,478 --> 01:05:24,917
- Let's cut more afterward. - That's right.

1858
01:05:24,918 --> 01:05:26,578
That was nice advice.

1859
01:05:28,918 --> 01:05:30,448
My stomach is empty now.

1860
01:05:31,388 --> 01:05:32,588
My stomach is empty now.

1861
01:05:33,088 --> 01:05:34,728
This will be amazing.

1862
01:05:35,688 --> 01:05:38,398
(He puts the special sauce on the fish-fragrant eggplant.)

1863
01:05:38,858 --> 01:05:39,928
Gosh, this is...

1864
01:05:40,328 --> 01:05:41,467
Shall I eat it in one bite?

1865
01:05:41,468 --> 01:05:45,097
(It goes straight into the mouth.)

1866
01:05:45,098 --> 01:05:47,437
- Isn't it hot? - No way. It doesn't look hot.

1867
01:05:47,438 --> 01:05:48,438
It must be okay.

1868
01:05:48,738 --> 01:05:50,867
It isn't okay. Steam is coming out of his mouth.

1869
01:05:50,868 --> 01:05:52,207
Steam came out of his mouth.

1870
01:05:52,208 --> 01:05:54,208
- Steam came out of his mouth. - Spit it out.

1871
01:05:56,078 --> 01:05:57,677
- Spit it out. - Say something.

1872
01:05:57,678 --> 01:05:59,718
- He can't spit it out. - Dong Hyun, say something.

1873
01:06:00,448 --> 01:06:02,947
It's like eating a hot dumpling.

1874
01:06:02,948 --> 01:06:04,518
The inside of his mouth is burnt.

1875
01:06:04,688 --> 01:06:07,157
Why did he eat it like that? It must be really hot.

1876
01:06:07,158 --> 01:06:09,628
All right. I cooled it down.

1877
01:06:09,958 --> 01:06:11,758
I cut it open.

1878
01:06:12,798 --> 01:06:13,897
It's incredible.

1879
01:06:13,898 --> 01:06:15,198
(Seung Ho takes a bite as well.)

1880
01:06:15,228 --> 01:06:18,338
- Seung Ho, take it out if it's hot. - Hey.

1881
01:06:18,638 --> 01:06:21,438
It isn't a matter of pride. Take it out.

1882
01:06:22,138 --> 01:06:23,138
It's hot.

1883
01:06:24,778 --> 01:06:25,907
Eat half a piece at a time.

1884
01:06:25,908 --> 01:06:26,938
Gosh, it's hot.

1885
01:06:28,608 --> 01:06:29,977
- Are you okay? - Yes, I can eat it.

1886
01:06:29,978 --> 01:06:31,177
(He can't say more.)

1887
01:06:31,178 --> 01:06:33,047
- He can eat it. - It's hot.

1888
01:06:33,048 --> 01:06:35,588
- Wait. Juice exploded in my mouth. - That's right.

1889
01:06:36,218 --> 01:06:37,818
We don't want to enjoy it halfheartedly.

1890
01:06:38,118 --> 01:06:39,618
Put it in your mouth and enjoy it.

1891
01:06:39,958 --> 01:06:41,558
How is a piece of eggplant so big?

1892
01:06:42,058 --> 01:06:44,728
Juice will suddenly come out.

1893
01:06:45,028 --> 01:06:47,309
- It's like a flood. - It might be a bit hot. Is it okay?

1894
01:06:47,558 --> 01:06:48,598
It's okay, right?

1895
01:06:48,828 --> 01:06:49,968
It's too hot.

1896
01:06:50,868 --> 01:06:52,168
- He got fooled. - I see.

1897
01:06:52,268 --> 01:06:54,198
It isn't salty at all.

1898
01:06:55,438 --> 01:06:56,568
It's so tasty.

1899
01:06:57,668 --> 01:06:58,677
My goodness.

1900
01:06:58,678 --> 01:07:00,158
(Eat as much as you want. I give up.)

1901
01:07:00,308 --> 01:07:01,948
I want to taste their jjamppong.

1902
01:07:03,408 --> 01:07:05,047
- You guys ordered hot pot. - If you think you'll regret it...

1903
01:07:05,048 --> 01:07:06,447
If you think you'll regret it, order the dish.

1904
01:07:06,448 --> 01:07:07,517
That's right.

1905
01:07:07,518 --> 01:07:09,147
- Please give us one jjamppong. - I can say that I've been here...

1906
01:07:09,148 --> 01:07:10,187
although I haven't tasted anything.

1907
01:07:10,188 --> 01:07:11,957
I'm not full at all.

1908
01:07:11,958 --> 01:07:13,717
Seriously. That's good.

1909
01:07:13,718 --> 01:07:15,987
- I'm not full at all. - Both Sang Uk and I love...

1910
01:07:15,988 --> 01:07:18,797
Chinese food. But it can upset the stomach...

1911
01:07:18,798 --> 01:07:19,897
- since it's oily. - Yes.

1912
01:07:19,898 --> 01:07:22,697
But these dishes aren't oily at all.

1913
01:07:22,698 --> 01:07:25,037
- I ate earlier. - You never know.

1914
01:07:25,038 --> 01:07:26,168
So you guys should eat more.

1915
01:07:27,198 --> 01:07:28,207
What's that? Oh, my.

1916
01:07:28,208 --> 01:07:29,807
- The dragon heads. - What's up with this pot?

1917
01:07:29,808 --> 01:07:31,878
- There are dragons. - The dragon heads.

1918
01:07:32,178 --> 01:07:35,208
That's why... That's how they serve hot pot.

1919
01:07:35,708 --> 01:07:37,918
- I mean... - This is the red soup.

1920
01:07:38,048 --> 01:07:39,147
This is the white soup.

1921
01:07:39,148 --> 01:07:40,354
- This is the yellow soup. - Mushroom.

1922
01:07:40,378 --> 01:07:42,917
- So... - The base is chicken. And this...

1923
01:07:42,918 --> 01:07:45,687
- Dried mushrooms and vegetables. - Dried mushrooms.

1924
01:07:45,688 --> 01:07:46,688
As for the red soup, the base is mala.
It's mala.

1925
01:07:47,689 --> 01:07:49,857
- I'll prepare the meat. - Okay.

1926
01:07:49,858 --> 01:07:51,728
- This is lamb. - Okay.

1927
01:07:52,098 --> 01:07:54,227
- This is beef. - Okay.

1928
01:07:54,228 --> 01:07:55,697
Here are the ingredients.

1929
01:07:55,698 --> 01:07:57,044
It's tastier to add them quickly, right?

1930
01:07:57,068 --> 01:07:59,137
Shouldn't we add them right away to have the flavors seep out?

1931
01:07:59,138 --> 01:08:00,397
I think you're right.

1932
01:08:00,398 --> 01:08:01,507
Dong Hyun, it's Korean beef.

1933
01:08:01,508 --> 01:08:03,568
- There is some inside. - Really?

1934
01:08:05,038 --> 01:08:07,038
It's the perfect time to eat. How nice.

1935
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,808
Ten seconds after adding the meat.

1936
01:08:10,308 --> 01:08:11,848
You should do that with beef brisket.

1937
01:08:13,078 --> 01:08:14,148
Isn't the mouthfeel nice?

1938
01:08:15,448 --> 01:08:16,648
We should add them right away.

1939
01:08:16,888 --> 01:08:18,517
- Then the flavors will seep out. - That's right.

1940
01:08:18,518 --> 01:08:19,687
I'll add the meat.

1941
01:08:19,688 --> 01:08:21,987
- We'll eat this soup the most. - Dong Hyun, don't do that.

1942
01:08:21,988 --> 01:08:23,227
You should separate the slices.

1943
01:08:23,228 --> 01:08:25,898
They'll separate in the soup.

1944
01:08:26,898 --> 01:08:29,968
(He adds all the meat in one go.)

1945
01:08:30,628 --> 01:08:31,637
Here.

1946
01:08:31,638 --> 01:08:33,244
(It's hard to tell which one is red and which one is white.)

1947
01:08:33,268 --> 01:08:34,437
Is this how you eat it?

1948
01:08:34,438 --> 01:08:36,484
- This isn't how you eat it. - Don't you dip it in the soup?

1949
01:08:36,508 --> 01:08:38,307
All done. What?

1950
01:08:38,308 --> 01:08:41,037
Don't you dip it in the soup...

1951
01:08:41,038 --> 01:08:42,677
- like shabu-shabu? - That was the idea I had.

1952
01:08:42,678 --> 01:08:44,047
- Why did you add everything? - Isn't it how it's done?

1953
01:08:44,048 --> 01:08:45,148
When will it boil?

1954
01:08:45,678 --> 01:08:47,677
- This isn't how you eat it. - Really?

1955
01:08:47,678 --> 01:08:49,587
- I just went with what you did. - You add one and eat it...

1956
01:08:49,588 --> 01:08:50,588
ten seconds later.

1957
01:08:50,589 --> 01:08:52,087
- I let you do... - Shall I take out the meat?

1958
01:08:52,088 --> 01:08:53,287
What you wanted to do.

1959
01:08:53,288 --> 01:08:54,357
"Shall I take out the meat?"

1960
01:08:54,358 --> 01:08:56,328
What should I do? The meat isn't cooked yet.

1961
01:08:56,688 --> 01:08:58,528
- Really? - It'll be strange to take it out.

1962
01:08:59,198 --> 01:09:00,627
Isn't it supposed to boil?

1963
01:09:00,628 --> 01:09:02,498
It's because the air conditioner is on high.

1964
01:09:02,598 --> 01:09:03,697
- There's cold wind. - You know,

1965
01:09:03,698 --> 01:09:05,738
Dong Hyun acted like a firefighter.

1966
01:09:06,368 --> 01:09:08,038
- He put out the heat. - Did he do that?

1967
01:09:09,138 --> 01:09:10,938
The air conditioner is on high.

1968
01:09:11,378 --> 01:09:13,338
You can eat it once the color changes.

1969
01:09:13,908 --> 01:09:15,308
- Hurry up and eat it. - It's nice.

1970
01:09:25,718 --> 01:09:27,157
- It's tasty, right? - Don't become sullen.

1971
01:09:27,158 --> 01:09:28,987
- It'll boil soon. - The white soup...

1972
01:09:28,988 --> 01:09:31,087
The white soup goes well with soy sauce.

1973
01:09:31,088 --> 01:09:32,327
The red soup goes well with peanut sauce.

1974
01:09:32,328 --> 01:09:33,528
Really?

1975
01:09:33,898 --> 01:09:35,097
I like this one.

1976
01:09:35,098 --> 01:09:36,297
- Which one? The clear one? - The white soup.

1977
01:09:36,298 --> 01:09:38,768
- Yes. - Each one likes different soup.

1978
01:09:39,268 --> 01:09:41,537
People sit down facing each other...

1979
01:09:41,538 --> 01:09:44,068
- when there are four or more. - Yes.

1980
01:09:44,338 --> 01:09:46,237
Then you can turn the pot.

1981
01:09:46,238 --> 01:09:48,178
- I see. - You can sit accordingly.

1982
01:09:49,408 --> 01:09:51,247
- Let's see what Dong Hyun likes. - As for me,

1983
01:09:51,248 --> 01:09:53,477
I like the mala-based soup. The spicy one.

1984
01:09:53,478 --> 01:09:55,388
Try it with peanut sauce.

1985
01:09:56,348 --> 01:09:59,117
(He listens to Seung Ho and dips it in peanut sauce.)

1986
01:09:59,118 --> 01:10:00,818
I really recommend it.

1987
01:10:01,328 --> 01:10:03,188
This sauce goes with everything.

1988
01:10:04,188 --> 01:10:05,597
(Impressed)

1989
01:10:05,598 --> 01:10:07,858
Is it normal to eat at one spot for so long?

1990
01:10:08,798 --> 01:10:09,867
It has been a while, right?

1991
01:10:09,868 --> 01:10:11,967
I think it's normal.

1992
01:10:11,968 --> 01:10:13,167
At the chicken restaurant,

1993
01:10:13,168 --> 01:10:15,208
- let's finish eating in 30 minutes. - Yes.

1994
01:10:15,468 --> 01:10:16,638
We'll show you.

1995
01:10:16,708 --> 01:10:18,337
In 30 minutes?

1996
01:10:18,338 --> 01:10:20,277
- The shoot. - A quiz for the freeloaders too?

1997
01:10:20,278 --> 01:10:21,508
- That's right. - Everything.

1998
01:10:22,078 --> 01:10:24,448
Shall we solve the quiz when jjamppong gets solved?

1999
01:10:24,508 --> 01:10:26,717
- Okay. That's a good idea. - In that case...

2000
01:10:26,718 --> 01:10:28,494
- Sir, please give us the bill. - Please give us the bill.

2001
01:10:28,518 --> 01:10:29,617
May I take it?

2002
01:10:29,618 --> 01:10:30,787
- Yes. - Let's see.

2003
01:10:30,788 --> 01:10:32,718
My guess is...

2004
01:10:33,818 --> 01:10:36,957
- The total is 225 dollars. - It's 225 dollars.

2005
01:10:36,958 --> 01:10:39,658
For the amount of food you guys ate, it isn't a lot.

2006
01:10:39,698 --> 01:10:41,768
- Tae Hyun, it's very cheap. - It's cost-effective.

2007
01:10:42,928 --> 01:10:44,738
You've seen...

2008
01:10:44,798 --> 01:10:48,137
a round table with a revolving tray at Chinese restaurants, right?

2009
01:10:48,138 --> 01:10:49,338
- Yes. - That's right.

2010
01:10:50,308 --> 01:10:51,807
This table was first invented...

2011
01:10:51,808 --> 01:10:54,138
in the US, not China.

2012
01:10:54,308 --> 01:10:56,178
(I see.)

2013
01:10:56,378 --> 01:10:59,377
Due to the convenience of not needing to carry food,

2014
01:10:59,378 --> 01:11:01,048
the product became very popular.

2015
01:11:01,718 --> 01:11:05,558
Afterward, it spread to China, Hong Kong, and other places.

2016
01:11:05,958 --> 01:11:07,118
In that case,

2017
01:11:07,218 --> 01:11:08,927
what's the name of this table?

2018
01:11:08,928 --> 01:11:10,058
What?

2019
01:11:10,858 --> 01:11:12,227
How would we know the answer?

2020
01:11:12,228 --> 01:11:13,927
- Do we need to answer in English? - Number one.

2021
01:11:13,928 --> 01:11:15,827
(It's a multiple-choice question.)

2022
01:11:15,828 --> 01:11:18,238
- It's nice. - Of course.

2023
01:11:18,368 --> 01:11:20,468
Number one, kind Susan.

2024
01:11:20,868 --> 01:11:21,968
- What? - Susan?

2025
01:11:22,238 --> 01:11:23,407
- Susan? - Susan.

2026
01:11:23,408 --> 01:11:25,178
A person's name? Okay.

2027
01:11:25,538 --> 01:11:28,048
Number two, lazy Susan.

2028
01:11:28,808 --> 01:11:30,948
- Lazy. - Number three, dizzy Susan.

2029
01:11:31,148 --> 01:11:33,848
Number four, diligent Susan.

2030
01:11:34,518 --> 01:11:35,587
Okay.

2031
01:11:35,588 --> 01:11:36,747
(Torn)

2032
01:11:36,748 --> 01:11:39,258
- I'm hung up on something. - What is it?

2033
01:11:39,988 --> 01:11:41,457
I'm hung up on Susan.

2034
01:11:41,458 --> 01:11:44,527
Why is it Susan?

2035
01:11:44,528 --> 01:11:46,397
- I'm so curious. - Let me explain.

2036
01:11:46,398 --> 01:11:48,698
Sang Uk, sit this one out and eat jjamppong.

2037
01:11:49,398 --> 01:11:51,327
- Let me explain. - Why is it Susan?

2038
01:11:51,328 --> 01:11:53,897
It's American culture.

2039
01:11:53,898 --> 01:11:55,468
In the US,

2040
01:11:55,568 --> 01:11:57,938
when something gets made,

2041
01:11:58,208 --> 01:12:01,138
they give it a person's name with an adjective.

2042
01:12:01,608 --> 01:12:02,884
The adjective describes the person.

2043
01:12:02,908 --> 01:12:05,647
- I get it. - The table isn't lazy or anything.

2044
01:12:05,648 --> 01:12:07,048
The adjective describes the person.

2045
01:12:07,748 --> 01:12:11,018
- Jjamppong is here. - Your jjamppong is here.

2046
01:12:12,618 --> 01:12:14,287
Solve the quiz as you eat.

2047
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:16,188
(Jjamppong appears.)

2048
01:12:16,658 --> 01:12:19,398
It's exactly what I need.

2049
01:12:20,728 --> 01:12:22,367
Kind Susan.

2050
01:12:22,368 --> 01:12:25,338
(He tries the soup first.)

2051
01:12:25,868 --> 01:12:27,967
Sang Uk, this...

2052
01:12:27,968 --> 01:12:30,267
Gosh, the soup is so refreshing.

2053
01:12:30,268 --> 01:12:31,508
(The soup is so refreshing.)

2054
01:12:32,478 --> 01:12:33,978
Is it refreshing? Hold on.

2055
01:12:34,848 --> 01:12:36,248
Hey, if it's refreshing...

2056
01:12:36,508 --> 01:12:39,718
(Dong Hyun's stomach begins to get stretched out.)

2057
01:12:39,848 --> 01:12:41,178
Just how refreshing is it?

2058
01:12:41,918 --> 01:12:43,848
It pushes down the chili oil.

2059
01:12:44,518 --> 01:12:45,818
If it's refreshing... Hold on.

2060
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:49,528
(Dong Hyun tries the soup since he's curious.)

2061
01:12:50,328 --> 01:12:52,597
(Moved)

2062
01:12:52,598 --> 01:12:54,458
- I love the smoky aroma. - Jjamppong.

2063
01:12:55,368 --> 01:12:56,527
It's refreshing.

2064
01:12:56,528 --> 01:12:57,768
(The smoky aroma is no joke.)

2065
01:12:58,838 --> 01:13:03,938
(Seung Ho tries the noodles first.)

2066
01:13:06,078 --> 01:13:07,137
(Blowing)

2067
01:13:07,138 --> 01:13:08,547
My goodness.

2068
01:13:08,548 --> 01:13:10,707
Even when you're absolutely full,

2069
01:13:10,708 --> 01:13:12,718
you can enjoy a bit of ramyeon at the end.

2070
01:13:12,918 --> 01:13:16,618
(The three members of Team Hot Pot begin to eat.)

2071
01:13:18,458 --> 01:13:24,758
(They're in the middle of solving a quiz.)

2072
01:13:26,458 --> 01:13:28,127
(They watch in a daze.)

2073
01:13:28,128 --> 01:13:30,328
How is it different from solving the quiz after eating?

2074
01:13:31,298 --> 01:13:33,537
- Do you intend to answer it? - Yes.

2075
01:13:33,538 --> 01:13:35,207
Can you solve the quiz before finishing the dish?

2076
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:37,248
(Can you solve the quiz before finishing the dish?)

2077
01:13:37,708 --> 01:13:39,777
(They focus on the quiz once more.)

2078
01:13:39,778 --> 01:13:41,307
(Thinking)

2079
01:13:41,308 --> 01:13:42,377
Dong Hyun,

2080
01:13:42,378 --> 01:13:43,708
I give my vote to lazy Susan.

2081
01:13:44,408 --> 01:13:45,717
That can't be it.

2082
01:13:45,718 --> 01:13:46,978
(Shutting him down)

2083
01:13:47,048 --> 01:13:48,218
Lazy Susan?

2084
01:13:48,618 --> 01:13:50,658
If lazy Susan is the answer, I'll pick up the bill.

2085
01:13:50,888 --> 01:13:52,957
It really isn't lazy Susan. Please believe me this once.

2086
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:55,134
Please believe me this once. It really isn't lazy Susan.

2087
01:13:55,158 --> 01:13:57,358
It's either 1 or 4. It's hard to pick between the 2.

2088
01:13:57,558 --> 01:13:59,457
I think it's either 1 or 4.

2089
01:13:59,458 --> 01:14:01,327
- They're more positive. - I don't know which one to choose.

2090
01:14:01,328 --> 01:14:03,668
Judging by the vibe,

2091
01:14:03,968 --> 01:14:06,097
they must've picked a name that was fun...

2092
01:14:06,098 --> 01:14:07,437
and witty.

2093
01:14:07,438 --> 01:14:09,238
When we consider the role of this table,

2094
01:14:09,308 --> 01:14:12,608
these names are very fitting. Kind Susan, diligent Susan.

2095
01:14:12,778 --> 01:14:14,407
I'm 60 percent sure that it's number 4.

2096
01:14:14,408 --> 01:14:15,547
I think it's number two.

2097
01:14:15,548 --> 01:14:16,707
- It really isn't number 2. - There are 4 choices.

2098
01:14:16,708 --> 01:14:18,724
One of the three choices you picked must be correct.

2099
01:14:18,748 --> 01:14:20,117
If number two is the answer, I'll pick up the bill.

2100
01:14:20,118 --> 01:14:21,477
- Okay. - Then I'll pick up the bill.

2101
01:14:21,478 --> 01:14:22,747
It really isn't number two.

2102
01:14:22,748 --> 01:14:24,047
Okay. Then hurry up...

2103
01:14:24,048 --> 01:14:25,358
- and say the answer. - Okay.

2104
01:14:25,658 --> 01:14:27,457
But "Diligent" sounds a bit awkward.

2105
01:14:27,458 --> 01:14:30,627
I think "Kind" is a better option.

2106
01:14:30,628 --> 01:14:32,428
Lastly, what's your choice?

2107
01:14:32,758 --> 01:14:34,628
- I got it. - What's the answer?

2108
01:14:35,498 --> 01:14:37,967
- Number 1, kind Susan. - Number 1, kind.

2109
01:14:37,968 --> 01:14:39,768
Number one, kind Susan.

2110
01:14:39,898 --> 01:14:41,267
If it's number two, I'll pick up the bill.

2111
01:14:41,268 --> 01:14:42,837
If it's number one, all of us will be happy.

2112
01:14:42,838 --> 01:14:45,537
(Number 1, kind Susan)

2113
01:14:45,538 --> 01:14:46,878
Kind Susan.

2114
01:14:47,878 --> 01:14:49,047
Incorrect.

2115
01:14:49,048 --> 01:14:50,947
(Number 1, kind Susan is incorrect.)

2116
01:14:50,948 --> 01:14:53,117
- Numbers 4, 2, and 3 remain. - Which number is it?

2117
01:14:53,118 --> 01:14:54,317
- It can't be number 3. - Is it number 3?

2118
01:14:54,318 --> 01:14:55,647
- It can't be number three. - Tell us.

2119
01:14:55,648 --> 01:14:57,747
- Tell us if it's number three. - Tell us.

2120
01:14:57,748 --> 01:14:59,487
If it's number three, all of us will give up.

2121
01:14:59,488 --> 01:15:01,688
- Dizzy Susan is... - Yes.

2122
01:15:02,388 --> 01:15:03,928
Incorrect.

2123
01:15:04,158 --> 01:15:06,297
- It's 1 of the 2. - My goodness.

2124
01:15:06,298 --> 01:15:07,738
- It's 1 of the 2. - I got it right.

2125
01:15:07,898 --> 01:15:09,698
I got it right. My goodness

2126
01:15:09,728 --> 01:15:10,867
It's number four.

2127
01:15:10,868 --> 01:15:12,437
I'm certain of it. Seriously.

2128
01:15:12,438 --> 01:15:14,698
I worked for an American company for many years.

2129
01:15:15,238 --> 01:15:17,267
- UFC? - I worked for ten years.

2130
01:15:17,268 --> 01:15:19,007
(Do you mean UFC?)

2131
01:15:19,008 --> 01:15:20,478
I worked for ten years.

2132
01:15:21,208 --> 01:15:22,677
Over the course of ten years,

2133
01:15:22,678 --> 01:15:25,147
I traveled back and forth.

2134
01:15:25,148 --> 01:15:27,377
I know the American vibe very well.

2135
01:15:27,378 --> 01:15:28,817
That's how they name things.

2136
01:15:28,818 --> 01:15:29,888
I'm 99 percent certain.

2137
01:15:29,948 --> 01:15:31,147
- What's the answer? - Which one is it?

2138
01:15:31,148 --> 01:15:32,488
Is it diligent Susan?

2139
01:15:32,658 --> 01:15:34,317
It's number two, lazy Susan.

2140
01:15:34,318 --> 01:15:35,857
(Number 2, lazy Susan)

2141
01:15:35,858 --> 01:15:38,857
(He was certain, but lazy Susan was correct.)

2142
01:15:38,858 --> 01:15:40,227
Are you serious?

2143
01:15:40,228 --> 01:15:41,927
- Are you serious? - Why?

2144
01:15:41,928 --> 01:15:43,698
- Don't lie. - I told you so.

2145
01:15:44,428 --> 01:15:45,637
- It has to be a lie. - I've never lived in the US.

2146
01:15:45,638 --> 01:15:46,867
(Dong Hyun will pay for the second time today.)

2147
01:15:46,868 --> 01:15:48,808
- Hold on. - But I got a hunch right away.

2148
01:15:49,038 --> 01:15:50,238
I told you so.

2149
01:15:50,768 --> 01:15:52,738
I've never lived in the US.

2150
01:15:53,078 --> 01:15:54,808
But I got a hunch right away.

2151
01:15:55,578 --> 01:15:56,677
I should've listened to Seung Ho.

2152
01:15:56,678 --> 01:15:58,247
(I should've listened to Seung Ho.)

2153
01:15:58,248 --> 01:15:59,978
Why did we eat so much?

2154
01:16:01,018 --> 01:16:02,618
Give it here. I'll eat everything.

2155
01:16:03,018 --> 01:16:04,217
That's how I solve questions.

2156
01:16:04,218 --> 01:16:05,487
It does a lot of damage.

2157
01:16:05,488 --> 01:16:06,918
(It does a lot of damage.)

2158
01:16:07,618 --> 01:16:10,087
(The total amount he has paid: 536 dollars)

2159
01:16:10,088 --> 01:16:11,288
I've paid 500 dollars.

2160
01:16:12,528 --> 01:16:13,857
- I don't need the receipt. - Okay.

2161
01:16:13,858 --> 01:16:15,067
Thank you.

2162
01:16:15,068 --> 01:16:16,797
(Total: 225 dollars)

2163
01:16:16,798 --> 01:16:17,998
It was a great meal.

2164
01:16:18,638 --> 01:16:19,937
Today, it's busy.

2165
01:16:19,938 --> 01:16:21,198
My card is busy.

2166
01:16:22,568 --> 01:16:27,008
(Darkness falls over the Seoul City Wall.)

2167
01:16:28,678 --> 01:16:30,407
(It's time...)

2168
01:16:30,408 --> 01:16:34,148
(when people who want to drink after work gather around.)

2169
01:16:35,048 --> 01:16:36,217
(Current time: 10pm)

2170
01:16:36,218 --> 01:16:38,987
- What exactly is here? - Hey.

2171
01:16:38,988 --> 01:16:40,057
What is this place?

2172
01:16:40,058 --> 01:16:41,157
It's Buam-dong.

2173
01:16:41,158 --> 01:16:44,027
Are we on top of a mountain?

2174
01:16:44,028 --> 01:16:46,097
We're on a hill.

2175
01:16:46,098 --> 01:16:47,297
(The members came back to the classy Buam-dong.)

2176
01:16:47,298 --> 01:16:48,697
I haven't come here in a while.

2177
01:16:48,698 --> 01:16:50,897
- Haven't you heard of Gyeyeolsa? - Gyeyeolsa?

2178
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:53,137
- What's Gyeyeolsa? - It's a very famous chicken place.

2179
01:16:53,138 --> 01:16:54,197
- Is it a restaurant? - Yes.

2180
01:16:54,198 --> 01:16:55,337
- Really? - Yes.

2181
01:16:55,338 --> 01:16:56,338
- Gyeyeolsa? - Gyeyeolsa?

2182
01:16:56,339 --> 01:16:58,037
Is it called Gyeyeolsa because it's a chicken restaurant?

2183
01:16:58,038 --> 01:17:00,208
- "Gye" means "Chicken." - "Gye" means "Chicken."

2184
01:17:00,408 --> 01:17:01,537
(The name gives off the energy of chickens.)

2185
01:17:01,538 --> 01:17:03,608
That's why it's called Gyeyeolsa.

2186
01:17:04,308 --> 01:17:05,647
It's very famous. It's impossible...

2187
01:17:05,648 --> 01:17:06,717
There it is.

2188
01:17:06,718 --> 01:17:08,517
Is the restaurant name Gyeyeolsa?

2189
01:17:08,518 --> 01:17:10,748
I can smell it. It smells like a chicken restaurant.

2190
01:17:11,448 --> 01:17:14,458
(It's situated in Buam-dong, a classy neighborhood.)

2191
01:17:15,158 --> 01:17:17,558
(It's a chicken restaurant that represents Seoul.)

2192
01:17:17,828 --> 01:17:20,558
(It frequently appears on a list of good restaurants.)

2193
01:17:20,658 --> 01:17:23,668
(There's always a line.)

2194
01:17:24,068 --> 01:17:25,367
(It's 1 of the 3 best chicken places.)

2195
01:17:25,368 --> 01:17:27,938
(It boasts of fried chicken and whelk noodles.)

2196
01:17:28,068 --> 01:17:32,538
(DMR 2, Chicken)

2197
01:17:33,008 --> 01:17:35,347
(They enter the chicken restaurant.)

2198
01:17:35,348 --> 01:17:38,378
It was on TV so many times.

2199
01:17:38,748 --> 01:17:40,017
One of the three best chicken places in Seoul.

2200
01:17:40,018 --> 01:17:42,364
- Look. It was on TV so many times. - "Life Perfectionist."

2201
01:17:42,388 --> 01:17:44,017
One of the three best chicken places in Seoul, Gyeyeolsa.

2202
01:17:44,018 --> 01:17:46,057
How is it different?

2203
01:17:46,082 --> 01:17:47,148
(The banner says it's 1 of the 3 best chicken places in Seoul.)

2204
01:17:47,172 --> 01:17:49,442
Who picks the three best chicken places?

2205
01:17:50,542 --> 01:17:52,782
- I'm curious. - All right.

2206
01:17:53,742 --> 01:17:55,388
- Is it true... - No seasoned fried chicken.

2207
01:17:55,412 --> 01:17:57,111
They don't sell seasoned fried chicken?

2208
01:17:57,112 --> 01:17:58,251
- That's right. - Whelk noodles.

2209
01:17:58,252 --> 01:17:59,928
Why don't they sell seasoned fried chicken?

2210
01:17:59,952 --> 01:18:01,691
They don't sell seasoned fried chicken.

2211
01:18:01,692 --> 01:18:02,992
- Really? - This place has...

2212
01:18:03,092 --> 01:18:05,261
whelk noodles.

2213
01:18:05,262 --> 01:18:07,562
It's tastier if you don't mix it.

2214
01:18:08,192 --> 01:18:10,191
This building is very old.

2215
01:18:10,192 --> 01:18:11,262
Right?

2216
01:18:11,762 --> 01:18:13,801
Let's order.

2217
01:18:13,802 --> 01:18:15,102
- Ma'am. - Ma'am.

2218
01:18:15,172 --> 01:18:16,272
Yes?

2219
01:18:16,502 --> 01:18:18,101
- Did you call for me? - Hello.

2220
01:18:18,102 --> 01:18:19,802
- Hello. - Hello.

2221
01:18:20,502 --> 01:18:21,871
(The owner of Gyeyeolsa, Park Seon Ok)

2222
01:18:21,872 --> 01:18:23,771
I can't believe such handsome men came.

2223
01:18:23,772 --> 01:18:26,082
How old is the restaurant?

2224
01:18:27,142 --> 01:18:28,452
The age doesn't matter.

2225
01:18:29,112 --> 01:18:31,151
- We're curious. - About 20 years.

2226
01:18:31,152 --> 01:18:32,281
- How many years? - About 20 years.

2227
01:18:32,282 --> 01:18:33,581
- About 20 years. - In this neighborhood alone.

2228
01:18:33,582 --> 01:18:34,781
- In this neighborhood alone. - Really?

2229
01:18:34,782 --> 01:18:36,492
- I fried chicken all my life. - Right?

2230
01:18:36,892 --> 01:18:37,892
I dedicated my life to chicken.

2231
01:18:37,893 --> 01:18:39,762
I can see that.

2232
01:18:39,862 --> 01:18:42,361
Who came up with the three best chicken restaurants?

2233
01:18:42,362 --> 01:18:43,791
The three best chicken restaurants...

2234
01:18:43,792 --> 01:18:45,802
were chosen by people in show business.

2235
01:18:45,862 --> 01:18:47,501
- They tried it. - It's clean...

2236
01:18:47,502 --> 01:18:49,101
- and tasty. - It's more meaningful.

2237
01:18:49,102 --> 01:18:51,971
It's hard to make fried chicken in a unique way.

2238
01:18:51,972 --> 01:18:53,201
- It isn't easy. - It's hard...

2239
01:18:53,202 --> 01:18:56,111
- to make it exceptionally tasty. - It isn't just the TV shows...

2240
01:18:56,112 --> 01:18:58,212
that call my fried chicken tasty.

2241
01:18:58,242 --> 01:18:59,611
It's people who have tried it.

2242
01:18:59,612 --> 01:19:02,281
Two people try it and bring four more people.

2243
01:19:02,282 --> 01:19:04,512
It became popular through word of mouth.

2244
01:19:04,552 --> 01:19:06,422
I open the restaurant at 11:30am.

2245
01:19:06,722 --> 01:19:08,491
- In the morning? - I open it at 11:30am.

2246
01:19:08,492 --> 01:19:10,151
By 12:10pm or 12:15pm,

2247
01:19:10,152 --> 01:19:11,391
both floors are full.

2248
01:19:11,392 --> 01:19:13,261
- For lunch? - Do they eat chicken for lunch?

2249
01:19:13,262 --> 01:19:14,562
- Yes. - Do you mean noon?

2250
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:15,932
At lunchtime?

2251
01:19:16,432 --> 01:19:18,562
(Around lunchtime, )

2252
01:19:18,702 --> 01:19:20,902
(people line up outside!)

2253
01:19:21,462 --> 01:19:24,371
(They line up...)

2254
01:19:24,372 --> 01:19:28,142
(to eat fried chicken of this place!)

2255
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:31,841
There must be a secret behind your fried chicken.

2256
01:19:31,842 --> 01:19:33,842
- Where did you learn it? - Well,

2257
01:19:33,912 --> 01:19:36,082
- I sold rice in Daejeon. - Okay.

2258
01:19:36,352 --> 01:19:38,881
Next to my store were a dishware store, a duvet store,

2259
01:19:38,882 --> 01:19:40,221
- and a chicken restaurant. - Okay.

2260
01:19:40,222 --> 01:19:42,391
My friend ran the chicken restaurant...

2261
01:19:42,392 --> 01:19:44,051
and it became successful after a few months.

2262
01:19:44,052 --> 01:19:46,661
I told her to add some potatoes.

2263
01:19:46,662 --> 01:19:48,061
However, she didn't do that...

2264
01:19:48,062 --> 01:19:49,542
since peeling them was too much work.

2265
01:19:49,732 --> 01:19:52,232
- She then left to run a cafe. - Right.

2266
01:19:52,402 --> 01:19:53,802
That was when I took over.

2267
01:19:54,532 --> 01:19:56,072
I added in potatoes after that...

2268
01:19:56,402 --> 01:19:58,082
and that made the city of Daejeon go wild.

2269
01:19:58,132 --> 01:19:59,601
The potatoes are fried with the chicken.

2270
01:19:59,602 --> 01:20:01,018
- They are fried with the chicken. - Really?

2271
01:20:01,042 --> 01:20:02,111
- That is what she's talking about. - The place went wild...

2272
01:20:02,112 --> 01:20:04,272
as the potatoes were good.

2273
01:20:05,782 --> 01:20:09,382
(How will it taste?)

2274
01:20:09,782 --> 01:20:12,952
I'm still not sure as I haven't tried it yet.

2275
01:20:13,352 --> 01:20:15,791
At this point, I'm not sure how good it'll be.

2276
01:20:15,792 --> 01:20:16,991
- You feel a bit suspicious, right? - Yes.

2277
01:20:16,992 --> 01:20:18,561
- Right. - It's hard to go wild...

2278
01:20:18,562 --> 01:20:19,991
over fried chicken.

2279
01:20:19,992 --> 01:20:20,992
(They still feel suspicious of the taste of the fried chicken.)

2280
01:20:20,993 --> 01:20:22,793
I feel quite excited about this place though.

2281
01:20:23,162 --> 01:20:25,432
This place feels more than just a popular place.

2282
01:20:25,732 --> 01:20:29,301
There are people who line up to eat here for lunch.

2283
01:20:29,302 --> 01:20:30,671
Lining up for fried chicken at lunch...

2284
01:20:30,672 --> 01:20:32,201
- is hard to believe. - There must be something...

2285
01:20:32,202 --> 01:20:33,841
- more than just popularity. - It's all about the taste.

2286
01:20:33,842 --> 01:20:35,922
There must be something about the taste of the food.

2287
01:20:36,112 --> 01:20:37,212
Just the taste.

2288
01:20:37,772 --> 01:20:41,382
(Meanwhile, in the kitchen...)

2289
01:20:43,982 --> 01:20:46,022
(The secret frying batter that has been blended...)

2290
01:20:46,252 --> 01:20:48,533
(gets poured over the fresh chicken and sliced potatoes.)

2291
01:20:50,322 --> 01:20:52,592
(It goes straight into the oil.)

2292
01:20:53,992 --> 01:20:56,492
(The chicken turns into a brilliant gold color.)

2293
01:20:58,292 --> 01:21:00,332
(Passionate)

2294
01:21:01,102 --> 01:21:03,632
(The well-fried chicken and potatoes get scooped up.)

2295
01:21:04,932 --> 01:21:07,772
(The oil gets shaken off...)

2296
01:21:08,612 --> 01:21:10,612
(and the chicken and potatoes get stacked up.)

2297
01:21:15,042 --> 01:21:18,452
(The legendary chicken that people line up for during lunch)

2298
01:21:18,922 --> 01:21:22,552
(Buam-dong's representative chicken, fried chicken)

2299
01:21:22,852 --> 01:21:23,852
It's here!

2300
01:21:24,952 --> 01:21:26,821
(They finally encounter the food.)

2301
01:21:26,822 --> 01:21:28,291
- The whelk noodles. - What?

2302
01:21:28,292 --> 01:21:29,692
What's with the whelk noodles?

2303
01:21:29,992 --> 01:21:31,161
You can't mix it up.

2304
01:21:31,162 --> 01:21:32,442
Right. You have to eat it as is.

2305
01:21:32,802 --> 01:21:34,002
I remembered it correctly.

2306
01:21:34,662 --> 01:21:35,701
(Fried chicken served with potatoes)

2307
01:21:35,702 --> 01:21:37,331
- Gosh! - I can fry chicken...

2308
01:21:37,332 --> 01:21:38,502
even with my eyes closed.

2309
01:21:39,342 --> 01:21:41,242
This can't be missed.

2310
01:21:41,372 --> 01:21:42,372
(Clapping)

2311
01:21:42,373 --> 01:21:43,671
My beer was chosen to be the best in Jongno...

2312
01:21:43,672 --> 01:21:45,481
last year and the year before.

2313
01:21:45,482 --> 01:21:46,681
- Really? - That was why...

2314
01:21:46,682 --> 01:21:48,611
I even went on a tour at a beer factory in Jeju.

2315
01:21:48,612 --> 01:21:50,581
Was there a competition?

2316
01:21:50,582 --> 01:21:52,422
No. It was based on a survey.

2317
01:21:52,682 --> 01:21:54,482
- I see. - My beer was chosen to be the best.

2318
01:21:55,022 --> 01:21:56,968
- The draft beer here is great. - It must be really good.

2319
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:59,661
In the summer, I sell around 12 to 13 a day.

2320
01:21:59,662 --> 01:22:02,191
- I sell even up to 15 a day. - Is this something sold here only?

2321
01:22:02,192 --> 01:22:03,862
Is this different from other beers?

2322
01:22:04,632 --> 01:22:05,931
It must have the flavor enhancer in it.

2323
01:22:05,932 --> 01:22:07,801
- Is this different? - It has the flavor enhancer in it.

2324
01:22:07,802 --> 01:22:09,501
You need to use flavor enhancers to make everything taste good.

2325
01:22:09,502 --> 01:22:10,772
It's amazing.

2326
01:22:11,102 --> 01:22:12,271
It's amazing, ma'am.

2327
01:22:12,272 --> 01:22:13,572
Thank you, ma'am.

2328
01:22:17,142 --> 01:22:18,572
Yi Kyung knows his chicken.

2329
01:22:18,842 --> 01:22:20,012
He got the best part.

2330
01:22:20,182 --> 01:22:21,641
- Right. - The best part.

2331
01:22:21,642 --> 01:22:23,082
- He's right. - It's the round part.

2332
01:22:24,012 --> 01:22:25,081
I'm so hungry.

2333
01:22:25,082 --> 01:22:27,482
(Yi Kyung got the drumette which is known as the best part.)

2334
01:22:27,682 --> 01:22:29,692
(It goes straight into his mouth.)

2335
01:22:32,892 --> 01:22:34,892
(Nodding automatically)

2336
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,462
Look at the steam.

2337
01:22:36,892 --> 01:22:38,862
- Check out the steam. - Gosh.

2338
01:22:38,962 --> 01:22:40,031
(Crispy)

2339
01:22:40,032 --> 01:22:41,062
I'm so hungry.

2340
01:22:41,462 --> 01:22:42,471
It's hot!

2341
01:22:42,472 --> 01:22:43,632
The oil has to drip.

2342
01:22:43,802 --> 01:22:44,932
The oil has to drip.

2343
01:22:45,172 --> 01:22:46,732
It's really think. Take a look at this.

2344
01:22:47,702 --> 01:22:49,612
The oil gets on your mouth.

2345
01:22:49,942 --> 01:22:50,942
I wish the chicken will still be hot.

2346
01:22:50,943 --> 01:22:52,181
It's different, isn't it?

2347
01:22:52,182 --> 01:22:53,281
- Yes. - Gosh.

2348
01:22:53,282 --> 01:22:54,811
- It really is different. - It must be done now.

2349
01:22:54,812 --> 01:22:56,511
The batter is so thin, but how is it so crispy?

2350
01:22:56,512 --> 01:22:57,512
It doesn't make sense.

2351
01:22:57,513 --> 01:22:58,982
The batter is thin but crispy.

2352
01:22:59,352 --> 01:23:00,482
This is how I make it.

2353
01:23:00,722 --> 01:23:01,881
Back then,

2354
01:23:01,882 --> 01:23:03,151
when you buy fried squid at the market,

2355
01:23:03,152 --> 01:23:04,991
there's this much flour when there's barely any squid.

2356
01:23:04,992 --> 01:23:06,422
- Right. - I hated that.

2357
01:23:06,662 --> 01:23:07,662
Right.

2358
01:23:07,663 --> 01:23:10,462
(Based on the owner's philosophy on chicken, )

2359
01:23:11,732 --> 01:23:15,572
(the frying batter is very thin.)

2360
01:23:16,102 --> 01:23:17,771
(Eating...)

2361
01:23:17,772 --> 01:23:19,071
(and eating again)

2362
01:23:19,072 --> 01:23:21,802
- Is there something? - Something feels different.

2363
01:23:23,012 --> 01:23:24,871
(Having another bite)

2364
01:23:24,872 --> 01:23:26,281
This can be eaten in a minute.

2365
01:23:26,282 --> 01:23:28,042
(Amazed)

2366
01:23:28,182 --> 01:23:30,482
I didn't even dip it in salt.

2367
01:23:30,682 --> 01:23:31,752
Something feels different.

2368
01:23:32,582 --> 01:23:34,881
It doesn't have...

2369
01:23:34,882 --> 01:23:36,591
- a super strong taste. - Not at all.

2370
01:23:36,592 --> 01:23:38,651
You can barely feel the batter. You reach the meat right away.

2371
01:23:38,652 --> 01:23:40,192
But how is it this crispy?

2372
01:23:40,992 --> 01:23:43,061
No franchise can copy this.

2373
01:23:43,062 --> 01:23:44,091
Never.

2374
01:23:44,092 --> 01:23:45,562
It's different, isn't it?

2375
01:23:45,762 --> 01:23:47,301
I told you it was different!

2376
01:23:47,302 --> 01:23:48,401
(Feeling proud)

2377
01:23:48,402 --> 01:23:49,501
I love this part.

2378
01:23:49,502 --> 01:23:50,502
- My gosh. - This part is good.

2379
01:23:50,503 --> 01:23:51,948
- You eat it like this. - This part is really good.

2380
01:23:51,972 --> 01:23:53,641
- With your front teeth. - The batter is crispy too.

2381
01:23:53,642 --> 01:23:55,641
- Just like this. - It will come off right away.

2382
01:23:55,642 --> 01:23:57,511
- I like the wide part. - This part is good too.

2383
01:23:57,512 --> 01:23:58,611
The wide part.

2384
01:23:58,612 --> 01:24:00,488
- This part is good too. - This part is good too.

2385
01:24:00,512 --> 01:24:02,712
- That's bad that you can't eat any. - This is it!

2386
01:24:03,012 --> 01:24:04,711
Can't you film for the show after eating together?

2387
01:24:04,712 --> 01:24:05,951
(The owner feels sad for the hot pot team.)

2388
01:24:05,952 --> 01:24:08,182
Could I get one to go later?

2389
01:24:08,452 --> 01:24:09,691
I would like to get one to go too.

2390
01:24:09,692 --> 01:24:10,891
This shouldn't be eaten at home.

2391
01:24:10,892 --> 01:24:11,892
(Of course, you can do that.)
(Sighing)

2392
01:24:13,592 --> 01:24:14,592
(Sighing)

2393
01:24:15,932 --> 01:24:18,361
(Their groans fill up the place.)

2394
01:24:18,362 --> 01:24:20,131
I should have the potato.

2395
01:24:20,132 --> 01:24:21,201
The potato...

2396
01:24:21,202 --> 01:24:23,032
was the start of her success.

2397
01:24:24,372 --> 01:24:26,272
Potatoes are loved by everybody.

2398
01:24:27,342 --> 01:24:29,572
(How does it taste?)

2399
01:24:30,072 --> 01:24:32,842
There are potatoes that are usually crispy.

2400
01:24:33,242 --> 01:24:34,542
This is a whole potato,

2401
01:24:34,842 --> 01:24:36,212
but it feels fluffy.

2402
01:24:37,112 --> 01:24:38,581
- Fluffy? - It's totally fluffy.

2403
01:24:38,582 --> 01:24:40,882
Like the potatoes that were steamed in a rice cooker.

2404
01:24:41,052 --> 01:24:42,352
Yes. You're exactly right.

2405
01:24:43,522 --> 01:24:46,692
(It looks crispy on the outside, )

2406
01:24:48,562 --> 01:24:51,991
(but the whole potato is moist like a steamed potato.)

2407
01:24:51,992 --> 01:24:54,232
Steamed ones are good, but how good would fried ones be?

2408
01:24:54,962 --> 01:24:56,882
Even shoes would taste good when they are fried.

2409
01:24:59,642 --> 01:25:01,742
(Legendary taste of the fried potato)

2410
01:25:02,442 --> 01:25:04,042
If you tried the fried chicken,

2411
01:25:04,272 --> 01:25:05,642
you have to try the noodles.

2412
01:25:06,242 --> 01:25:08,412
The whelk noodles.

2413
01:25:08,812 --> 01:25:10,712
Should we start with the noodles?

2414
01:25:10,782 --> 01:25:11,782
Right. Don't mix them together.

2415
01:25:11,783 --> 01:25:14,482
- Should I just try the noodles? - Yes.

2416
01:25:14,552 --> 01:25:16,892
- I gave you chopsticks. - I want to try it like this.

2417
01:25:17,092 --> 01:25:18,752
Tae Hyun still struggles with chopsticks.

2418
01:25:19,792 --> 01:25:20,922
It's because he's a baby.

2419
01:25:21,362 --> 01:25:22,861
Tae Hyun is forever a baby.

2420
01:25:22,862 --> 01:25:23,932
Gosh, what is this?

2421
01:25:24,592 --> 01:25:27,032
(He tries the noodles without the sauce.)

2422
01:25:29,032 --> 01:25:31,131
(How does it taste?)

2423
01:25:31,132 --> 01:25:33,071
Even just the noodles are good.

2424
01:25:33,072 --> 01:25:35,402
It's already so good with just the noodles.

2425
01:25:35,642 --> 01:25:37,542
(Highest praise)

2426
01:25:37,872 --> 01:25:40,681
Take some of this here.

2427
01:25:40,682 --> 01:25:41,811
(Yi Kyung gets the vegetables and the whelk.)

2428
01:25:41,812 --> 01:25:43,051
- The whelk is inside. - Gosh.

2429
01:25:43,052 --> 01:25:44,332
- Look at how big it is. - Here.

2430
01:25:45,352 --> 01:25:47,782
(Expectant)

2431
01:25:49,492 --> 01:25:50,922
No wonder.

2432
01:25:55,462 --> 01:25:57,362
(Thumbs up)

2433
01:25:58,092 --> 01:26:00,232
(He even eats the whelk.)

2434
01:26:02,672 --> 01:26:05,002
(Touched)

2435
01:26:05,472 --> 01:26:06,671
How should I put this?

2436
01:26:06,672 --> 01:26:08,701
- It should be eaten with the whelk. - To be on television,

2437
01:26:08,702 --> 01:26:09,902
I went to a sauna before this.

2438
01:26:09,942 --> 01:26:11,211
(The owner reappears.)

2439
01:26:11,212 --> 01:26:12,212
Sorry?

2440
01:26:12,213 --> 01:26:14,533
- You went to a sauna? - I got a scrub for 50 dollars too.

2441
01:26:14,682 --> 01:26:15,882
I wanted to look nice.

2442
01:26:16,582 --> 01:26:17,911
(Smiling)

2443
01:26:17,912 --> 01:26:18,921
(Thumbs up)

2444
01:26:18,922 --> 01:26:19,981
No wonder.

2445
01:26:19,982 --> 01:26:21,322
(No wonder she looked great.)

2446
01:26:22,252 --> 01:26:25,052
(Tae Hyun takes a bite with the whelk as well.)

2447
01:26:30,462 --> 01:26:31,831
(Amazed)

2448
01:26:31,832 --> 01:26:33,432
The whelk tastes refreshing.

2449
01:26:34,332 --> 01:26:36,408
- Is it because of the fruit? - It's because of the fruit.

2450
01:26:36,432 --> 01:26:37,732
A lot of fruit goes in.

2451
01:26:37,872 --> 01:26:38,941
- Right. - There's a reason...

2452
01:26:38,942 --> 01:26:41,262
- You can't get sick of this. - why it shouldn't be mixed.

2453
01:26:41,642 --> 01:26:43,511
The noodles were seasoned with sesame oil.

2454
01:26:43,512 --> 01:26:44,611
They were seasoned differently.

2455
01:26:44,612 --> 01:26:46,382
Soy sauce was used for the noodles.

2456
01:26:47,212 --> 01:26:48,341
A different sauce was used for the whelk and vegetables.

2457
01:26:48,342 --> 01:26:50,812
(Spicy and refreshing sauce with vegetables and fruit)

2458
01:26:51,952 --> 01:26:53,922
They don't need to be mixed.

2459
01:26:55,992 --> 01:26:59,162
(The whelk noodles you can't stop reaching out for)

2460
01:26:59,992 --> 01:27:02,932
I don't think you can get sick of this because of the fruit.

2461
01:27:03,032 --> 01:27:04,032
You can't get sick of this.

2462
01:27:04,033 --> 01:27:05,473
(It has the ultimate addictiveness.)

2463
01:27:05,662 --> 01:27:09,602
(Whelk noodles)

2464
01:27:09,972 --> 01:27:11,908
I understand why this is eaten as an actual meal.

2465
01:27:11,932 --> 01:27:14,172
I don't even remember being upset about the dongpo pork.

2466
01:27:14,302 --> 01:27:15,442
(Eating)

2467
01:27:16,312 --> 01:27:18,411
Gosh, I'm hungry. Why am I feeling hungry?

2468
01:27:18,412 --> 01:27:19,412
My gosh.

2469
01:27:20,112 --> 01:27:23,151
(The members of the hot pot team are almost out of patience.)

2470
01:27:23,152 --> 01:27:24,182
It doesn't make sense.

2471
01:27:24,412 --> 01:27:25,721
- The noodles... - Tae Hyun.

2472
01:27:25,722 --> 01:27:27,728
Didn't you say you were going to end it in 30 minutes?

2473
01:27:27,752 --> 01:27:30,222
You're enjoying it way too much right now.

2474
01:27:30,752 --> 01:27:33,361
- Are you serious? - These guys are liars too.

2475
01:27:33,362 --> 01:27:35,221
Exactly. Don't trust them.

2476
01:27:35,222 --> 01:27:36,961
(What can I do? It tastes so good.)

2477
01:27:36,962 --> 01:27:38,031
That's how it should be.

2478
01:27:38,032 --> 01:27:39,931
It's the last moment and we should follow the rules.

2479
01:27:39,932 --> 01:27:41,601
Right. It should be just one person first.

2480
01:27:41,602 --> 01:27:43,202
Just one person can eat both dishes.

2481
01:27:43,502 --> 01:27:44,701
One person?

2482
01:27:44,702 --> 01:27:45,771
- One person for two dishes? - Right.

2483
01:27:45,772 --> 01:27:47,201
- That sounds great. - One person.

2484
01:27:47,202 --> 01:27:48,271
The fried chicken and potatoes...

2485
01:27:48,272 --> 01:27:49,512
and the noodles.

2486
01:27:50,072 --> 01:27:51,171
Promise me this though.

2487
01:27:51,172 --> 01:27:53,942
The other two who lose the chance to eat shouldn't whine or complain.

2488
01:27:54,482 --> 01:27:56,328
The other two who lose the chance to eat shouldn't whine or complain.

2489
01:27:56,352 --> 01:27:58,152
I'll see what happens when that moment comes.

2490
01:27:58,412 --> 01:28:00,381
Well, I can whine at least once when that moment comes.

2491
01:28:00,382 --> 01:28:01,822
- At least once. - All right.

2492
01:28:02,622 --> 01:28:04,351
- I'll go for it. - Do your best.

2493
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:05,451
(The quiz for the freeloaders begins.)

2494
01:28:05,452 --> 01:28:07,862
This is a saying by the philosopher, Francis Bacon.

2495
01:28:08,062 --> 01:28:10,732
- I like sayings. - There are a lot of sayings.

2496
01:28:11,662 --> 01:28:14,332
"This is a great servant."

2497
01:28:14,562 --> 01:28:16,632
- "Servant?" - Right.

2498
01:28:17,002 --> 01:28:18,931
"But a bad master."

2499
01:28:18,932 --> 01:28:20,171
("This a great servant but a bad master.")

2500
01:28:20,172 --> 01:28:21,172
(What could this be?)

2501
01:28:21,173 --> 01:28:22,442
"But a bad master?"

2502
01:28:22,712 --> 01:28:23,712
"Servant and master."

2503
01:28:24,212 --> 01:28:25,972
Gosh, this is hard. I'm not getting an idea.

2504
01:28:26,842 --> 01:28:27,881
What does this mean?

2505
01:28:27,882 --> 01:28:29,652
"A bad master?"

2506
01:28:30,612 --> 01:28:32,352
Was this said in the past?

2507
01:28:33,222 --> 01:28:34,721
It's from the Middle Ages.

2508
01:28:34,722 --> 01:28:36,422
- The Middle Ages? - "Servant and master."

2509
01:28:36,722 --> 01:28:37,921
- "Servant and master." - "Servant and master."

2510
01:28:37,922 --> 01:28:39,792
- That's what it's about, right? - Yes.

2511
01:28:40,022 --> 01:28:41,791
What does this mean?

2512
01:28:41,792 --> 01:28:42,832
What?

2513
01:28:43,332 --> 01:28:44,892
Honey, I'm at a chicken place.

2514
01:28:46,162 --> 01:28:48,282
It's known as 1 of the top 3 chicken places in Seoul.

2515
01:28:48,332 --> 01:28:50,701
Is it okay for him to be on the phone right now?

2516
01:28:50,702 --> 01:28:51,732
Hold on.

2517
01:28:52,132 --> 01:28:53,441
Is this okay?

2518
01:28:53,442 --> 01:28:54,962
Does he have the privilege to do that?

2519
01:28:55,302 --> 01:28:56,812
Should I pack some home?

2520
01:28:58,372 --> 01:28:59,382
What?

2521
01:28:59,882 --> 01:29:03,051
I should have this even at night.

2522
01:29:03,052 --> 01:29:04,282
It's so good.

2523
01:29:04,452 --> 01:29:06,582
- He's a funny guy. - He wants to pack some home.

2524
01:29:07,822 --> 01:29:09,591
Gosh, this is just amazing.

2525
01:29:09,592 --> 01:29:10,592
(He quickly hangs up.)

2526
01:29:10,992 --> 01:29:12,112
What was the question again?

2527
01:29:12,422 --> 01:29:14,592
"This is a great servant..."

2528
01:29:15,222 --> 01:29:17,132
"but a bad master."

2529
01:29:17,492 --> 01:29:19,432
- Isn't it money? - That wasn't it.

2530
01:29:19,562 --> 01:29:20,562
- I got it. - I got it.

2531
01:29:20,732 --> 01:29:22,731
(After hearing Tae Hyun's answer...)

2532
01:29:22,732 --> 01:29:24,071
(Calling for the answer)

2533
01:29:24,072 --> 01:29:25,272
- I was a bit faster. - Right.

2534
01:29:25,802 --> 01:29:26,872
- Oh Sang Uk. - Money.

2535
01:29:27,302 --> 01:29:29,142
- Money. - That must be the right answer.

2536
01:29:29,972 --> 01:29:30,972
Correct.

2537
01:29:30,973 --> 01:29:33,112
(Answer: Money)

2538
01:29:34,112 --> 01:29:35,142
You got it right away!

2539
01:29:35,482 --> 01:29:36,951
(Looking bright)

2540
01:29:36,952 --> 01:29:38,482
I'll make a suggestion.

2541
01:29:38,682 --> 01:29:40,452
He got it right after hearing from Tae Hyun,

2542
01:29:40,582 --> 01:29:42,502
so let Dong Hyun and I answer one more question.

2543
01:29:42,552 --> 01:29:43,621
It'll be for just one piece.

2544
01:29:43,622 --> 01:29:44,622
(He can't accept the result.)

2545
01:29:44,623 --> 01:29:45,652
I don't need to eat.

2546
01:29:47,022 --> 01:29:48,992
It was money.

2547
01:29:49,392 --> 01:29:52,232
(Dong Hyun feels disappointed as well.)

2548
01:29:52,402 --> 01:29:54,162
Tae Hyun went, "Isn't it money?"

2549
01:29:54,932 --> 01:29:55,932
- "I got it!" - "I got it!"

2550
01:29:55,933 --> 01:29:57,731
(They both called for the answer right away.)

2551
01:29:57,732 --> 01:29:59,442
Gosh, I was late by 0.1 seconds.

2552
01:29:59,502 --> 01:30:01,178
I guess this is why you're a gold medalist.

2553
01:30:01,202 --> 01:30:04,072
(He proved himself why he's a gold medalist.)

2554
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,911
- Give it a try, Sang Uk. - Right.

2555
01:30:05,912 --> 01:30:07,311
You've had a lot of chicken. It will feel different.

2556
01:30:07,312 --> 01:30:08,612
(Crispy)

2557
01:30:08,882 --> 01:30:10,212
- You can hear it. - Gosh.

2558
01:30:10,712 --> 01:30:11,851
It sounds amazing.

2559
01:30:11,852 --> 01:30:12,952
(Amazed)

2560
01:30:13,782 --> 01:30:15,051
(Jealous)

2561
01:30:15,052 --> 01:30:16,391
You can barely feel the frying batter, right?

2562
01:30:16,392 --> 01:30:17,991
It really doesn't have much of the frying batter.

2563
01:30:17,992 --> 01:30:19,391
- Exactly. - Is it different?

2564
01:30:19,392 --> 01:30:21,761
- You just heard the sound. - Right.

2565
01:30:21,762 --> 01:30:23,162
As soon as it goes into your mouth,

2566
01:30:23,362 --> 01:30:25,661
the frying batter disappears...

2567
01:30:25,662 --> 01:30:26,838
and the crispiness goes away quickly.

2568
01:30:26,862 --> 01:30:28,131
Gosh, 0.1 seconds.

2569
01:30:28,132 --> 01:30:29,702
(Disappointed by 0.1 seconds)

2570
01:30:30,302 --> 01:30:32,001
I'll go for this now.

2571
01:30:32,002 --> 01:30:33,962
(He gets a good amount of the whelk noodles too.)

2572
01:30:34,542 --> 01:30:36,172
That's a good bite for him.

2573
01:30:37,012 --> 01:30:38,741
Gosh, the whelk is this big.

2574
01:30:38,742 --> 01:30:39,942
Right.

2575
01:30:40,742 --> 01:30:43,082
(Slurping the noodles in one go)

2576
01:30:44,182 --> 01:30:45,252
My gosh.

2577
01:30:49,082 --> 01:30:51,292
(He even eats the whelk.)

2578
01:30:54,222 --> 01:30:55,392
Is it different?

2579
01:30:56,162 --> 01:30:58,432
When something tastes too strong and you take a bite,

2580
01:30:58,592 --> 01:31:00,392
- you hesitate from eating it again. - Right.

2581
01:31:00,762 --> 01:31:02,261
This can be eaten nonstop.

2582
01:31:02,262 --> 01:31:04,632
There's something different about the noodles.

2583
01:31:04,932 --> 01:31:07,772
- Right. - Thin noodles were used.

2584
01:31:08,872 --> 01:31:14,141
(The tasting of the fried chicken and whelk noodles is over!)

2585
01:31:14,142 --> 01:31:15,142
The bill.

2586
01:31:15,182 --> 01:31:16,382
We just had...

2587
01:31:16,712 --> 01:31:20,081
two glasses of beer, whelk noodles, and fried chicken.

2588
01:31:20,082 --> 01:31:21,981
The takeout chicken for four members...

2589
01:31:21,982 --> 01:31:23,022
have been added.

2590
01:31:23,092 --> 01:31:25,751
It's a total of five portions of fried chicken after that.

2591
01:31:25,752 --> 01:31:27,992
It's 145 dollars together.

2592
01:31:31,362 --> 01:31:35,332
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

2593
01:31:35,432 --> 01:31:39,471
We use this often in our daily lives.

2594
01:31:39,472 --> 01:31:41,702
It's used often in our daily lives.

2595
01:31:41,902 --> 01:31:44,611
The start of this was when ancient people used this...

2596
01:31:44,612 --> 01:31:46,711
- when drinking beer. - When drinking beer.

2597
01:31:46,712 --> 01:31:48,241
Unlike now,

2598
01:31:48,242 --> 01:31:50,611
the beer of the old times had the beer residue in the beer.

2599
01:31:50,612 --> 01:31:51,612
Beer residue.

2600
01:31:51,613 --> 01:31:53,081
This item was used to drink just the beer...

2601
01:31:53,082 --> 01:31:55,822
without having to take out the beer residue.

2602
01:31:56,252 --> 01:31:57,791
What is this item?

2603
01:31:57,792 --> 01:31:59,392
But it's used often in our daily lives.

2604
01:32:00,462 --> 01:32:04,132
If we think of it to be the strainer,

2605
01:32:04,292 --> 01:32:07,131
this wouldn't be called something that's used often.

2606
01:32:07,132 --> 01:32:08,132
No.

2607
01:32:09,432 --> 01:32:11,131
Could it be something like a towel or cloth?

2608
01:32:11,132 --> 01:32:13,401
- Something like a handkerchief? - Something like that.

2609
01:32:13,402 --> 01:32:16,211
(A cloth that can strain out the residue?)

2610
01:32:16,212 --> 01:32:18,542
There's one thing that came to mind.

2611
01:32:18,742 --> 01:32:19,742
What is it?

2612
01:32:21,112 --> 01:32:23,152
(Sang Uk tells him his answer.)

2613
01:32:23,382 --> 01:32:24,551
Is this it, Sang Uk?

2614
01:32:24,552 --> 01:32:26,822
(Seung Ho writes it on his hand.)

2615
01:32:27,122 --> 01:32:28,962
It was that one. You two have the same answer.

2616
01:32:29,052 --> 01:32:30,491
- You're right. - Why are you two so good?

2617
01:32:30,492 --> 01:32:31,692
That came to mind.

2618
01:32:33,122 --> 01:32:36,292
(They check the answer with the staff.)

2619
01:32:36,492 --> 01:32:38,231
Okay. They said it was right.

2620
01:32:38,232 --> 01:32:39,431
- It's right? - Quiet.

2621
01:32:39,432 --> 01:32:40,932
Gosh, you got the answer right away?

2622
01:32:41,262 --> 01:32:42,262
- Sang Uk got it? - Yes.

2623
01:32:42,632 --> 01:32:44,831
I'm good with things from the past.

2624
01:32:44,832 --> 01:32:46,371
After being in this show,

2625
01:32:46,372 --> 01:32:48,653
I started listening to shows that are informative in bed.

2626
01:32:48,872 --> 01:32:51,071
- That's cheating! - Gosh.

2627
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,311
- Hey! - You study?

2628
01:32:52,312 --> 01:32:54,682
- That's cheating! - I study before I come.

2629
01:32:56,252 --> 01:32:59,152
The clear part could be scooped up.

2630
01:32:59,582 --> 01:33:01,851
The clear part could be scooped up for just the beer.

2631
01:33:01,852 --> 01:33:03,168
(An item that helps you scoop up the clear part?)

2632
01:33:03,192 --> 01:33:04,651
You've seen the fencing masks, right?

2633
01:33:04,652 --> 01:33:05,721
- Yes. - Yes.

2634
01:33:05,722 --> 01:33:07,602
They would be perfect to scoop out the residue.

2635
01:33:07,792 --> 01:33:09,661
- I suppose so. - It's the perfect size.

2636
01:33:09,662 --> 01:33:12,292
But those aren't used often in our daily lives.

2637
01:33:12,532 --> 01:33:14,132
I use it often in my daily life.

2638
01:33:15,102 --> 01:33:17,271
It was used during ancient times,

2639
01:33:17,272 --> 01:33:19,202
but it's still being used often now.

2640
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:21,441
(It's still being used often now?)

2641
01:33:21,442 --> 01:33:22,912
Isn't it the cup?

2642
01:33:24,142 --> 01:33:25,142
Cup.

2643
01:33:26,582 --> 01:33:27,642
Cup.

2644
01:33:28,912 --> 01:33:30,951
That's something we use often in our daily lives.

2645
01:33:30,952 --> 01:33:32,551
- That makes more sense. - It was scooped up like this.

2646
01:33:32,552 --> 01:33:33,621
Right.

2647
01:33:33,622 --> 01:33:36,051
It doesn't have to be something...

2648
01:33:36,052 --> 01:33:38,692
like a piece of cloth or strainer.

2649
01:33:39,092 --> 01:33:40,838
These three have become silent all of a sudden.

2650
01:33:40,862 --> 01:33:42,521
Seeing how they've become silent all of a sudden...

2651
01:33:42,522 --> 01:33:43,892
You should go for it.

2652
01:33:44,562 --> 01:33:45,962
I got it. Cup.

2653
01:33:48,532 --> 01:33:49,602
Really?

2654
01:33:49,802 --> 01:33:51,701
(Cup)

2655
01:33:51,702 --> 01:33:53,071
That is incorrect.

2656
01:33:53,072 --> 01:33:54,242
(Incorrect)

2657
01:33:54,542 --> 01:33:55,871
(I got fooled.)

2658
01:33:55,872 --> 01:33:58,641
- Nice! - You two should go for it.

2659
01:33:58,642 --> 01:34:00,111
- The two of us? - Yes.

2660
01:34:00,112 --> 01:34:02,881
You can choose to go with this one if you wish.

2661
01:34:02,882 --> 01:34:04,111
We can get the hints then.

2662
01:34:04,112 --> 01:34:07,252
I use this every single day when I have work.

2663
01:34:07,982 --> 01:34:08,982
Every single day.

2664
01:34:09,652 --> 01:34:11,591
Right. I guess that's right.

2665
01:34:11,592 --> 01:34:13,222
He uses this when he has work?

2666
01:34:13,362 --> 01:34:14,421
I got it. Hat.

2667
01:34:14,422 --> 01:34:16,731
Hat is incorrect.

2668
01:34:16,732 --> 01:34:18,162
I use this every day.

2669
01:34:18,662 --> 01:34:20,832
I think that's the case for everyone.

2670
01:34:21,502 --> 01:34:23,032
I can't live without this.

2671
01:34:23,832 --> 01:34:25,432
I got it. Mask.

2672
01:34:25,502 --> 01:34:26,641
Mask is incorrect.

2673
01:34:26,642 --> 01:34:28,071
- What could it be? - Mask?

2674
01:34:28,072 --> 01:34:29,712
How was this made back then?

2675
01:34:30,012 --> 01:34:31,771
- What did they make it with? - I think...

2676
01:34:31,772 --> 01:34:34,641
it would've been a different material from now.

2677
01:34:34,642 --> 01:34:37,282
(A different material than from now?)

2678
01:34:37,482 --> 01:34:38,512
Straw?

2679
01:34:39,622 --> 01:34:40,722
Lee Yi Kyung. Straw?

2680
01:34:40,882 --> 01:34:41,921
You must be right.

2681
01:34:41,922 --> 01:34:43,052
(Is that the answer?)

2682
01:34:43,292 --> 01:34:44,292
Correct.

2683
01:34:44,293 --> 01:34:45,592
(Straw)

2684
01:34:45,622 --> 01:34:47,892
Gosh, how did you get that?

2685
01:34:48,022 --> 01:34:49,122
I thought of it right away.

2686
01:34:50,032 --> 01:34:51,432
That makes sense.

2687
01:34:53,832 --> 01:34:55,402
But was the residue...

2688
01:34:56,172 --> 01:34:58,501
sucked out or was the straw put into the beer?

2689
01:34:58,502 --> 01:34:59,502
Wouldn't it have been put into the beer?

2690
01:34:59,503 --> 01:35:00,901
- No. - What?

2691
01:35:00,902 --> 01:35:01,971
Hold on. That's not it.

2692
01:35:01,972 --> 01:35:03,441
I assumed the residue to be sucked out.

2693
01:35:03,442 --> 01:35:05,411
That's not it. The residue sinks to the bottom.

2694
01:35:05,412 --> 01:35:06,541
Wasn't the straw used to drink just the beer?

2695
01:35:06,542 --> 01:35:07,711
That must've been how it was used.

2696
01:35:07,712 --> 01:35:09,582
- Just from the top. - Just like makgeolli.

2697
01:35:10,712 --> 01:35:11,811
- I see. - How did you get it right?

2698
01:35:11,812 --> 01:35:12,821
(Everyone is unsure how Sang Uk got it right.)

2699
01:35:12,822 --> 01:35:15,321
Tae Hyun will be buying us fried chicken.

2700
01:35:15,322 --> 01:35:16,921
Right. That's great.

2701
01:35:16,922 --> 01:35:18,921
This has never happened before on our show, right?

2702
01:35:18,922 --> 01:35:24,131
This is something you definitely want to share with someone.

2703
01:35:24,132 --> 01:35:28,761
It's a taste you want to enjoy with someone close.

2704
01:35:28,762 --> 01:35:30,872
I thought about my manager right away.

2705
01:35:31,232 --> 01:35:34,471
This is something my manager should definitely try.

2706
01:35:34,472 --> 01:35:35,971
You were reminded of your loving family.

2707
01:35:35,972 --> 01:35:37,771
- This is worth sharing. - Right.

2708
01:35:37,772 --> 01:35:39,371
- You also thought of your family. - Right.

2709
01:35:39,372 --> 01:35:42,041
It must be a given to think about your loved ones...

2710
01:35:42,042 --> 01:35:44,012
or people around you when you have good food.

2711
01:35:44,852 --> 01:35:46,681
I'll be taking the fried chicken home.

2712
01:35:46,682 --> 01:35:49,182
I think my wife will ask why there is only one drumstick.

2713
01:35:49,422 --> 01:35:50,582
There was only one drumstick?

2714
01:35:51,922 --> 01:35:53,562
I'm going to have it on my way back home.

2715
01:35:54,622 --> 01:35:56,062
(As expected)

2716
01:35:56,092 --> 01:35:57,361
After getting it packed,

2717
01:35:57,362 --> 01:35:59,361
I'm going to have it in the car right away.

2718
01:35:59,362 --> 01:36:00,932
(The last meal comes to an end.)

2719
01:36:01,502 --> 01:36:03,632
- Here. - Right. It's 145 dollars.

2720
01:36:04,902 --> 01:36:06,202
It was amazing.

2721
01:36:06,602 --> 01:36:08,741
- Really? - It was amazing.

2722
01:36:08,742 --> 01:36:11,311
I'm taking some home for the kids as it was so good.

2723
01:36:11,312 --> 01:36:13,241
(He brought it home safely.)

2724
01:36:13,242 --> 01:36:15,011
Thank you.

2725
01:36:15,012 --> 01:36:18,012

(The baseball star is on a diet?)

2737
01:36:38,445 --> 01:36:39,445
Today...

2738
01:36:39,446 --> 01:36:41,091
