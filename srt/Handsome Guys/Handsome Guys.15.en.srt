1
00:00:29,552 --> 00:00:31,321
It's amazing here. What is this?

2
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,462
- Gosh.
- It's very cold.

3
00:00:32,922 --> 00:00:35,292
Isn't the wind chill temperature minus 12°C?

4
00:00:35,462 --> 00:00:36,931
You should put more clothes on.

5
00:00:36,932 --> 00:00:37,932
Do you want one?

6
00:00:37,933 --> 00:00:39,961
The weather will get warmer by the time the show airs.

7
00:00:39,962 --> 00:00:41,731
Everyone else has one.

8
00:00:41,732 --> 00:00:43,431
You joined us so naturally.

9
00:00:43,432 --> 00:00:45,341
Yes, I didn't notice that I was here.

10
00:00:45,342 --> 00:00:46,641
(Why are you standing here?)

11
00:00:46,642 --> 00:00:49,411
Usually, this is Dong Hyun's spot.

12
00:00:49,412 --> 00:00:51,541
Due to the conflict in his schedule,

13
00:00:51,542 --> 00:00:53,742
I'll be here for exactly one episode.

14
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,251
Gosh, thank you.

15
00:00:55,252 --> 00:00:57,011
You say it so decisively that it's one episode.

16
00:00:57,012 --> 00:00:58,122
Exactly one episode.

17
00:00:58,982 --> 00:01:00,851
- Not two episodes?
- No, that's too difficult.

18
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:01,921
(Refusing firmly)

19
00:01:01,922 --> 00:01:02,922
(Laughing)

20
00:01:02,923 --> 00:01:05,121
This is our first time in Gangwon Province.

21
00:01:05,122 --> 00:01:06,522
Isn't it colder than last time?

22
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:08,231
- It's freezing today.
- It's because we're...

23
00:01:08,232 --> 00:01:09,361
- in Gangwon Province.
- Right.

24
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:11,361
We're in the north.

25
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,701
The wind chill temperature is minus 13°C.

26
00:01:13,702 --> 00:01:15,301
Let's meet the guest who came all the way here.

27
00:01:15,302 --> 00:01:16,901
What did he do so wrong for him to come here?

28
00:01:16,902 --> 00:01:18,672
- I feel bad for him.
- Please come out.

29
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:20,542
(Today's guest is...)

30
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:21,611
Gosh.

31
00:01:21,612 --> 00:01:23,311
- Hello.
- Hello.

32
00:01:23,312 --> 00:01:24,611
He's pretending to be excited.

33
00:01:24,612 --> 00:01:25,742
Hello.

34
00:01:25,912 --> 00:01:27,351
- He's pretending to be excited.
- Hello.

35
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:29,311
- Hello.
- Hello.

36
00:01:29,312 --> 00:01:30,682
He's almost as tall as me.

37
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:32,421
You know everyone.

38
00:01:32,422 --> 00:01:33,891
Please stand here.

39
00:01:33,892 --> 00:01:35,221
Gosh, stay where you are.

40
00:01:35,222 --> 00:01:36,921
Please introduce yourself.

41
00:01:36,922 --> 00:01:38,391
Hello.

42
00:01:38,392 --> 00:01:39,561
(Feeling shy)

43
00:01:39,562 --> 00:01:41,661
I'm honored to be on Handsome Guys...

44
00:01:41,662 --> 00:01:43,561
where only top stars are invited.

45
00:01:43,562 --> 00:01:44,632
I'm Kwak Si Yang.

46
00:01:44,832 --> 00:01:46,462
It's Si Yang.

47
00:01:48,332 --> 00:01:50,541
(On "Flex X Cop,")

48
00:01:50,542 --> 00:01:53,071
(he played a psychopath.)

49
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:54,742
I wasn't hitting on her.

50
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:57,211
(On "My Dearest Nemesis,")

51
00:01:57,212 --> 00:02:00,242
(he played an homme fatal character.)

52
00:02:00,582 --> 00:02:04,082
(Kwak Si Yang, an actor who can play both good and bad)

53
00:02:04,252 --> 00:02:06,128
- How do you know each other?
- I'm a subscriber on your channel.

54
00:02:06,152 --> 00:02:07,651
Thank you.

55
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:09,351
Sung Hoon, do you know what he does?

56
00:02:09,352 --> 00:02:11,161
Isn't he an actor?

57
00:02:11,162 --> 00:02:12,791
- A spouse?
- An actor.

58
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:14,832
- Thank you.
- My mouth is frozen.

59
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:16,992
- Put more clothes on.
- I mean...

60
00:02:17,362 --> 00:02:18,731
He's dressed...

61
00:02:18,732 --> 00:02:19,961
- Sung Hoon.
- Why didn't you dress warmly?

62
00:02:19,962 --> 00:02:21,531
Put your hands in your pockets after telling them.

63
00:02:21,532 --> 00:02:22,802
No way.

64
00:02:24,272 --> 00:02:25,771
It's cold. Thank you.

65
00:02:25,772 --> 00:02:27,541
He has many restrictions, but he's so cold.

66
00:02:27,542 --> 00:02:28,641
(His hands aren't polite.)

67
00:02:28,642 --> 00:02:31,582
Can you give some hand warmers to Sung Hoon?

68
00:02:31,712 --> 00:02:33,181
He should've worn gloves.

69
00:02:33,182 --> 00:02:34,281
What is he doing?

70
00:02:34,282 --> 00:02:35,282
(Just put on some gloves.)

71
00:02:35,283 --> 00:02:37,321
He looks cold. The opening segment will take 40 more minutes.

72
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:38,422
Will you be okay?

73
00:02:38,782 --> 00:02:40,082
Let's hurry up.

74
00:02:40,922 --> 00:02:42,791
Whatever we do,

75
00:02:42,792 --> 00:02:44,568
- "Hurry up?" - it will be edited out anyway.

76
00:02:44,592 --> 00:02:45,621
Either way...

77
00:02:45,622 --> 00:02:47,362
He knows everything now.

78
00:02:47,632 --> 00:02:49,292
He's a genius.

79
00:02:49,832 --> 00:02:50,931
Si Yang will...

80
00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:53,062
- split us into teams.
- It's Si Yang.

81
00:02:53,902 --> 00:02:56,472
Since he's here to support,

82
00:02:57,072 --> 00:02:59,071
I'll play rock-paper-scissors with Sung Hoon.

83
00:02:59,072 --> 00:03:01,111
Why don't we take turns to pick our teammates?

84
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:03,541
- Picking teammates?
- I thought that'd be a good idea.

85
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:04,941
- Let me tell you something.
- What?

86
00:03:04,942 --> 00:03:07,281
Those who eat a lot and those who eat less.

87
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:08,851
- He doesn't eat at all.
- Right.

88
00:03:08,852 --> 00:03:09,981
I eat less than others.

89
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,451
- They eat a lot.
- We're standing here together.

90
00:03:11,452 --> 00:03:12,581
Right.

91
00:03:12,582 --> 00:03:13,822
They eat a lot.

92
00:03:13,922 --> 00:03:15,682
When we get one question right, we go crazy.

93
00:03:15,892 --> 00:03:17,492
Si Yang, how much do you eat?

94
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:18,821
I like to eat.

95
00:03:18,822 --> 00:03:20,491
It's because he's tall.

96
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,392
Gosh, just keep that in mind.

97
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:25,962
I'm curious to know. How little do you eat?

98
00:03:26,202 --> 00:03:27,501
- I mean...
- We only eat...

99
00:03:27,502 --> 00:03:28,901
- when we're hungry.
- Although I eat little,

100
00:03:28,902 --> 00:03:30,071
I enjoy the food.

101
00:03:30,072 --> 00:03:32,172
Watching him eat makes you lose your appetite.

102
00:03:32,742 --> 00:03:33,902
Let me explain.

103
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:36,911
I've eaten a lot with Yi Kyung and Tae Hyun.

104
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:39,181
Let me apologize beforehand.

105
00:03:39,182 --> 00:03:41,052
When I watch them eat, I get stressed out.

106
00:03:43,312 --> 00:03:44,681
- Is it that bad?
- Yes.

107
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,981
They give you a look when you're eating.

108
00:03:45,982 --> 00:03:47,152
They're in a hurry to leave.

109
00:03:47,522 --> 00:03:49,251
We should consider how much you eat.

110
00:03:49,252 --> 00:03:50,691
- Mix the members.
- All right.

111
00:03:50,692 --> 00:03:52,191
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

112
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,292
(Rock, paper)

113
00:03:54,032 --> 00:03:55,292
Si Yang will go first.

114
00:03:55,932 --> 00:03:57,062
Hold on.

115
00:03:58,332 --> 00:04:00,162
I was going to pick one of them, but...

116
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:02,431
Gosh, I'm in trouble.

117
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,571
Isn't it hard to decide?

118
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:06,441
I will pick Seung Ho.

119
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:07,512
- Seung Ho?
- Yes.

120
00:04:07,612 --> 00:04:08,641
(His first choice is Seung Ho.)

121
00:04:08,642 --> 00:04:09,642
Seung Ho who likes to eat.

122
00:04:09,643 --> 00:04:11,781
I'll get a double portion.

123
00:04:11,782 --> 00:04:13,022
Play rock-paper-scissors again.

124
00:04:13,542 --> 00:04:14,882
Only the winner gets to pick.

125
00:04:15,312 --> 00:04:17,651
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

126
00:04:17,652 --> 00:04:18,752
(Scissors, paper)

127
00:04:19,182 --> 00:04:20,551
They're taking turns.

128
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:21,552
(Sung Hoon is the second one to choose.)

129
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,552
(Looking around)

130
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:24,461
Will he pick someone who eats well?

131
00:04:24,462 --> 00:04:26,121
(Laughing)

132
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:27,191
I'll go with you.

133
00:04:27,192 --> 00:04:28,461
(Picking Sang Uk without thinking)

134
00:04:28,462 --> 00:04:29,691
See that? We're left.

135
00:04:29,692 --> 00:04:31,931
- They pick those who eat well.
- We have to eat.

136
00:04:31,932 --> 00:04:33,931
- Yes, we have to eat.
- Exactly.

137
00:04:33,932 --> 00:04:35,348
- We have to eat.
- It's a restaurant tour.

138
00:04:35,372 --> 00:04:36,501
When the winner picks,

139
00:04:36,502 --> 00:04:39,101
the remaining member will join the other team.

140
00:04:39,102 --> 00:04:40,418
- Rock-paper-scissors.
- Rock-paper-scissors.

141
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:41,672
It's Si Yang.

142
00:04:42,172 --> 00:04:43,371
To be honest...

143
00:04:43,372 --> 00:04:45,582
It has to be less stressful.

144
00:04:45,882 --> 00:04:47,551
There isn't much difference between us.

145
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:48,811
We aren't much different.

146
00:04:48,812 --> 00:04:50,852
- I'll go with Yi Kyung.
- Gosh.

147
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:53,051
Us three?

148
00:04:53,052 --> 00:04:54,122
Us three.

149
00:04:54,692 --> 00:04:56,321
- Tae Hyun got picked last.
- Join us.

150
00:04:56,322 --> 00:04:58,091
- Eat this time.
- What?

151
00:04:58,092 --> 00:04:59,961
You'd better eat today, okay?

152
00:04:59,962 --> 00:05:01,032
(Eating buddy)

153
00:05:02,132 --> 00:05:03,231
I'll do my best to eat.

154
00:05:03,232 --> 00:05:04,602
- We're a team today.
- Okay.

155
00:05:04,732 --> 00:05:08,002
Today is a special on noodle dishes in Gangwon Province.

156
00:05:08,472 --> 00:05:09,971
- Again?
- It's about food.

157
00:05:09,972 --> 00:05:11,241
(Today's theme, Noodle Road in Gangwon Province)

158
00:05:11,242 --> 00:05:13,271
Gangwon Province doesn't have many rice fields.

159
00:05:13,272 --> 00:05:14,742
It's very mountainous,

160
00:05:14,842 --> 00:05:16,872
so it's known for food made with flour.

161
00:05:17,612 --> 00:05:24,182
(A feast of diverse noodle dishes)

162
00:05:26,082 --> 00:05:30,092
(Through slurping endless noodles)

163
00:05:30,652 --> 00:05:34,562
(Shall we walk on the Noodle Road?)

164
00:05:35,592 --> 00:05:37,701
It must be jjamppong soft tofu in Gangneung.

165
00:05:37,702 --> 00:05:38,761
That sounds good too.

166
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:39,901
Be careful when you pick Gangneung.

167
00:05:39,902 --> 00:05:42,101
- Jang kalguksu and jjamppong.
- Two squares for Gangneung.

168
00:05:42,102 --> 00:05:43,731
Sung Hoon, do you know all these dishes?

169
00:05:43,732 --> 00:05:45,271
No, it's my first time here.

170
00:05:45,272 --> 00:05:47,142
It's my first time in Gangwon.

171
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:48,841
Sung Hoon, do you know what this is?

172
00:05:48,842 --> 00:05:51,042
- What is it?
- You've only hit the nasal ridge.

173
00:05:51,312 --> 00:05:52,312
(Bursting out laughing)

174
00:05:52,313 --> 00:05:53,411
The nasal ridge.

175
00:05:53,412 --> 00:05:54,881
- Really?
- The nasal ridge.

176
00:05:54,882 --> 00:05:56,581
You eat while hitting the other's nasal ridge.

177
00:05:56,582 --> 00:05:57,821
Someone will...

178
00:05:57,822 --> 00:05:59,752
It will be new for you.

179
00:06:00,222 --> 00:06:02,191
Sung Hoon, you don't know what potato dough soup is, do you?

180
00:06:02,192 --> 00:06:03,691
No, I don't know any.

181
00:06:03,692 --> 00:06:05,121
How about makguksu or buckwheat noodles?

182
00:06:05,122 --> 00:06:06,522
Let's just go. I heard you.

183
00:06:06,862 --> 00:06:08,732
(Laughing)

184
00:06:09,232 --> 00:06:11,661
- I don't know any.
- Sung Hoon must be frozen.

185
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,132
He's cold.

186
00:06:13,262 --> 00:06:16,001
Today, you will eat all the dishes on the board.

187
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:17,002
That's great.

188
00:06:17,003 --> 00:06:19,118
You don't have to get the right answer in order to eat.

189
00:06:19,142 --> 00:06:20,471
- We eat first then take the quiz?
- Yes.

190
00:06:20,472 --> 00:06:22,812
- You can eat all those dishes.
- We get to eat?

191
00:06:23,072 --> 00:06:25,311
When you get the correct answer,

192
00:06:25,312 --> 00:06:27,411
you'll get an exercise card instead.

193
00:06:27,412 --> 00:06:29,381
- An exercise card?
- Wait.

194
00:06:29,382 --> 00:06:31,221
Are you telling us to eat and digest repeatedly?

195
00:06:31,222 --> 00:06:32,222
Right.

196
00:06:32,223 --> 00:06:34,692
We shouldn't exercise right after eating.

197
00:06:36,092 --> 00:06:37,092
That's true.

198
00:06:37,093 --> 00:06:38,821
- Don't you agree?
- You should never do that.

199
00:06:38,822 --> 00:06:40,822
- Otherwise, you'll vomit.
- We shouldn't do that.

200
00:06:40,932 --> 00:06:42,431
It makes it hard to digest.

201
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:43,531
Is that so?

202
00:06:43,532 --> 00:06:45,201
You have to wait 1 or 2 hours no matter what.

203
00:06:45,202 --> 00:06:46,861
Your team can wait before exercising.

204
00:06:46,862 --> 00:06:48,131
Of course.

205
00:06:48,132 --> 00:06:49,502
(Smiling)

206
00:06:50,032 --> 00:06:51,371
(Then we'll lose.)

207
00:06:51,372 --> 00:06:54,142
Then we'll get the penalty tomorrow.

208
00:06:54,912 --> 00:06:56,142
For the losing team,

209
00:06:56,742 --> 00:06:59,342
there will be an activity in Gangwon Province.

210
00:06:59,682 --> 00:07:01,452
Working at a noodle restaurant for one day.

211
00:07:02,052 --> 00:07:03,381
Working at a noodle restaurant?

212
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:04,551
A noodle restaurant?

213
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:06,221
- Working at a restaurant?
- That won't be easy.

214
00:07:06,222 --> 00:07:07,991
Since we're split into Team Handsome and Guys,

215
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:09,951
we should get our chance cards.

216
00:07:09,952 --> 00:07:11,692
How should we pick them?

217
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:13,491
- You go first.
- Me?

218
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:14,991
The eldest first. It's been a while.

219
00:07:14,992 --> 00:07:16,831
- Please.
- The eldest first.

220
00:07:16,832 --> 00:07:18,201
(Picking chance cards in the order of their age)

221
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:19,862
Please pick a good one.

222
00:07:20,532 --> 00:07:22,772
(What will be the result?)

223
00:07:23,002 --> 00:07:24,202
Darn it.

224
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:26,172
- It's not bad.
- It's not bad.

225
00:07:27,202 --> 00:07:28,912
(How about Team Handsome?)

226
00:07:29,112 --> 00:07:31,082
(Shrieking with joy)

227
00:07:32,012 --> 00:07:34,082
- We got it.
- They can't possibly be happy.

228
00:07:34,382 --> 00:07:35,752
They can't possibly be happy.

229
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:38,051
- I picked a new card.
- We have a new one too.

230
00:07:38,052 --> 00:07:39,082
It's really nice.

231
00:07:39,422 --> 00:07:40,581
The new card.

232
00:07:40,582 --> 00:07:42,492
It's exercise transfer card.

233
00:07:42,652 --> 00:07:43,691
- What?
- What?

234
00:07:43,692 --> 00:07:45,021
(Exercise transfer card)

235
00:07:45,022 --> 00:07:46,491
(Possible to transfer the exercise card to the other team)

236
00:07:46,492 --> 00:07:48,031
Once we answer the quiz,

237
00:07:48,032 --> 00:07:49,692
can't we transfer our exercise to them?

238
00:07:50,132 --> 00:07:51,962
This is amazing.

239
00:07:52,562 --> 00:07:53,701
Mine is the GPS card.

240
00:07:53,702 --> 00:07:54,672
- What?
- The GPS.

241
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:56,071
- Tracking card?
- It's one of the old ones.

242
00:07:56,072 --> 00:07:57,101
Reattempt card.

243
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,982
- We have one reattempt card.
- Reattempt card.

244
00:07:59,572 --> 00:08:00,772
We also have a reattempt card.

245
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:02,341
What else?

246
00:08:02,342 --> 00:08:04,072
We can also put you to sleep.

247
00:08:04,642 --> 00:08:06,141
That's not good.

248
00:08:06,142 --> 00:08:07,682
Eat, exercise, and take a nap.

249
00:08:07,852 --> 00:08:09,012
That sounds great.

250
00:08:09,452 --> 00:08:11,381
(Feeling dizzy)

251
00:08:11,382 --> 00:08:13,021
Si Yang's card is...

252
00:08:13,022 --> 00:08:14,422
- something totally new.
- What?

253
00:08:14,592 --> 00:08:17,051
Mine is called wish card.

254
00:08:17,052 --> 00:08:19,262
The production crew will grant us one wish.

255
00:08:20,022 --> 00:08:21,692
It could be another reattempt card.

256
00:08:21,892 --> 00:08:24,532
If you transfer the exercise to us, we can return it to you.

257
00:08:24,602 --> 00:08:26,131
(It's possible to make the transfer card powerless.)

258
00:08:26,132 --> 00:08:27,132
(Flustered)

259
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:29,301
It's like they have two reattempt cards.

260
00:08:29,302 --> 00:08:31,301
Or we can give you all of our exercises.

261
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,302
(Or we can give you all of our exercises.)

262
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:35,241
It's a card that makes anything possible.

263
00:08:35,242 --> 00:08:37,011
Yes, it seems like the best.

264
00:08:37,012 --> 00:08:38,642
(How will they use their wish card?)

265
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:41,751
Before you set out, here's the quiz...

266
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:43,381
for the Handsome Guys square.

267
00:08:43,382 --> 00:08:44,382
Okay.

268
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:46,921
Si Yang, are you good at quizzes?

269
00:08:46,922 --> 00:08:48,521
- I'm terrible.
- That's great.

270
00:08:48,522 --> 00:08:49,652
It's okay.

271
00:08:49,892 --> 00:08:52,791
The questions are impossible to imagine,

272
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:53,862
so it's okay.

273
00:08:54,022 --> 00:08:56,191
After the Japanese Invasion of Korea...

274
00:08:56,192 --> 00:08:57,291
What?

275
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:58,531
(After the Japanese Invasion of Korea)

276
00:08:58,532 --> 00:09:00,401
Pine trees needed to rebuild...

277
00:09:00,402 --> 00:09:03,132
Gyeongbokgung Palace were...

278
00:09:03,532 --> 00:09:05,642
transported from Auraji in Jeongseon to Hanyang.

279
00:09:06,042 --> 00:09:08,642
They were transported by this.

280
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:10,672
- The pine trees?
- Yes.

281
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:12,242
I know the answer.

282
00:09:13,942 --> 00:09:15,752
- I know the answer.
- This was used.

283
00:09:16,382 --> 00:09:18,721
A cart.

284
00:09:18,722 --> 00:09:21,551
(Will he succeed so quickly?)

285
00:09:21,552 --> 00:09:22,552
(Answer: Cart)

286
00:09:22,553 --> 00:09:23,651
That's incorrect.

287
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:25,221
- Finish the question.
- Keep going.

288
00:09:25,222 --> 00:09:27,091
As the transporters earned...

289
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:28,591
a lot of money,

290
00:09:28,592 --> 00:09:30,591
the phrase "making a fortune" derived from their work.

291
00:09:30,592 --> 00:09:32,308
- They made a fortune from doing it?
- Yes.

292
00:09:32,332 --> 00:09:34,301
- What could this be?
- "Making a fortune?"

293
00:09:34,302 --> 00:09:36,302
- I know the answer.
- Go ahead.

294
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:39,542
How about this? Since it was impossible to carry them,

295
00:09:40,172 --> 00:09:41,842
they used something like a boat.

296
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:45,041
Doesn't the phrase remind you of a raft?

297
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,441
- A huge raft.
- A big one?

298
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:48,151
- A raft?
- As a support.

299
00:09:48,152 --> 00:09:49,881
But it's nowhere near the sea.

300
00:09:49,882 --> 00:09:50,952
There's a river.

301
00:09:51,782 --> 00:09:53,422
- A boat or a raft.
- A boat?

302
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:55,322
I think it's a raft.

303
00:09:55,422 --> 00:09:56,622
- A raft?
- Yes.

304
00:09:56,722 --> 00:09:58,221
It's what they used.

305
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,391
- No way.
- I don't think so.

306
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:01,461
(Answer: Raft)

307
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:02,992
That's correct.

308
00:10:07,102 --> 00:10:09,502
- Fortune.
- Goodness.

309
00:10:10,032 --> 00:10:12,742
(Unbelievable)

310
00:10:12,872 --> 00:10:16,342
You know what? You don't need to eat today.

311
00:10:16,412 --> 00:10:17,572
I don't need to eat?

312
00:10:17,912 --> 00:10:19,181
- Perfectly...
- Yes.

313
00:10:19,182 --> 00:10:20,511
That's amazing.

314
00:10:20,512 --> 00:10:22,982
- Is there a body of water?
- Nearby,

315
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:25,781
there's a tributary of the Han River.

316
00:10:25,782 --> 00:10:28,652
When you cut down trees here and send them on the river,

317
00:10:28,722 --> 00:10:29,952
the raft will arrive in Seoul.

318
00:10:30,192 --> 00:10:31,961
It can't be where "making the fortune" comes from.

319
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:33,492
- The phrase comes from it.
- Really?

320
00:10:33,562 --> 00:10:35,261
- As they earned a lot of money?
- Yes.

321
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:36,491
(The phrase derives from rafters who earned a lot back then.)

322
00:10:36,492 --> 00:10:37,531
It's not even resentful.

323
00:10:37,532 --> 00:10:39,002
- We never got to try.
- Yes.

324
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:40,361
The answer was correct.

325
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:42,601
(Handsome Guys won by Team Guys)

326
00:10:42,602 --> 00:10:44,962
- We're off to a good start.
- I made things more balanced.

327
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:48,011
- They have two reattempt cards.
- Right.

328
00:10:48,012 --> 00:10:49,092
Which exercise did you get?

329
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:50,941
We'll probably run here.

330
00:10:50,942 --> 00:10:52,541
- What's your exercise?
- A walking relay.

331
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:54,312
- A walking relay?
- You'll do it here.

332
00:10:54,452 --> 00:10:56,181
This is a piece of cake.

333
00:10:56,182 --> 00:10:57,612
It's easy for us.

334
00:10:57,852 --> 00:10:59,451
- Let's go.
- We'll get going.

335
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:01,791
- Bye. See you later.
- See you again.

336
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:03,221
- Pyeongchang?
- Good luck.

337
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:04,621
- Pyeongchang?
- Drive safely.

338
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,862
Go to Pyeongchang.

339
00:11:06,122 --> 00:11:09,091
(Team Handsome)

340
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:10,591
They'll finish the exercise fast.

341
00:11:10,592 --> 00:11:13,661
They have to finish the walk in 125 seconds.

342
00:11:13,662 --> 00:11:15,148
The longest they would take is ten minutes.

343
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:17,601
Jeongseon is nearby.

344
00:11:17,602 --> 00:11:20,172
Jeongseon Market is around the corner.

345
00:11:20,502 --> 00:11:22,872
Also, Sokcho and Gangneung are close.

346
00:11:23,312 --> 00:11:25,442
- If we go to these places...
- Bingo in one go?

347
00:11:25,742 --> 00:11:26,841
(Will they go after the top row?)

348
00:11:26,842 --> 00:11:28,182
Sokcho, Gangneung?

349
00:11:30,152 --> 00:11:32,482
I will go with your opinion today.

350
00:11:32,622 --> 00:11:34,351
- Let's go to Jeongseon.
- Let's go there.

351
00:11:34,352 --> 00:11:37,391
We're heading to Jeongseon.

352
00:11:37,392 --> 00:11:38,591
(Moving to Jeongseon)

353
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:40,822
We need to make good use of the wish card.

354
00:11:41,592 --> 00:11:43,392
We'll think of good ideas.

355
00:11:43,692 --> 00:11:45,208
Seung Ho is good at coming up with them.

356
00:11:45,232 --> 00:11:47,532
Can't we put them to sleep for an hour?

357
00:11:48,532 --> 00:11:50,232
- As our wish?
- Yes.

358
00:11:50,832 --> 00:11:54,641
Make the other team use public transportation today.

359
00:11:54,642 --> 00:11:55,812
(Idea 2 for the wish card)

360
00:11:56,172 --> 00:11:57,342
That's ridiculous, right?

361
00:11:57,742 --> 00:11:59,641
Prohibit them from riding the car for three hours.

362
00:11:59,642 --> 00:12:00,682
(Idea 3 for the wish card)

363
00:12:02,312 --> 00:12:04,752
How about making them drink?

364
00:12:05,882 --> 00:12:07,051
(Laughing)

365
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:08,322
So that they can't drive?

366
00:12:08,922 --> 00:12:10,852
This would be fun. When they eat,

367
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:12,491
- Seung Ho.
- we can make them drink.

368
00:12:12,492 --> 00:12:14,398
(The thought of pulling pranks on them gives him ideas.)

369
00:12:14,422 --> 00:12:16,261
The sunlight feels nice.

370
00:12:16,262 --> 00:12:17,432
(Team Guys)

371
00:12:17,492 --> 00:12:18,831
(Walking Relay: Finish in 125 seconds.)

372
00:12:18,832 --> 00:12:19,902
Will we make it?

373
00:12:20,362 --> 00:12:22,101
One of us has to go...

374
00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:23,402
all the way there.

375
00:12:23,672 --> 00:12:24,771
That will be difficult.

376
00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:27,542
Another person has to go all the way there.

377
00:12:27,912 --> 00:12:30,041
Here's the referee who will help you...

378
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:31,381
with the walking relay today.

379
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:32,641
- We have a referee?
- Yes.

380
00:12:32,642 --> 00:12:34,011
- Really?
- Please come closer.

381
00:12:34,012 --> 00:12:35,452
We don't need a referee.

382
00:12:35,512 --> 00:12:38,221
What? We even have a referee?

383
00:12:38,222 --> 00:12:41,451
Currently, I'm a referee at walking races.

384
00:12:41,452 --> 00:12:42,852
- My name is Kim Dae Ho.
- Really?

385
00:12:43,092 --> 00:12:44,922
Gosh, what a surprise.

386
00:12:45,062 --> 00:12:46,322
Is this necessary?

387
00:12:46,362 --> 00:12:48,661
Is it possible to pick it up right away?

388
00:12:48,662 --> 00:12:50,562
Hearing you say that makes me worried.

389
00:12:51,832 --> 00:12:53,861
- Why?
- You're an athlete.

390
00:12:53,862 --> 00:12:55,502
Shouldn't you be good at it?

391
00:12:55,602 --> 00:12:58,542
Instead, you have a lot of doubt.

392
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:00,901
It's not about strength.

393
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:03,371
Isn't there a technique to walking?

394
00:13:03,372 --> 00:13:05,842
Can we learn and do it right away?

395
00:13:06,012 --> 00:13:08,412
- Shall we try it now?
- By the way...

396
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:10,982
During the walking race,

397
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,751
both feet can't be off the ground...

398
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:14,852
like you're running.

399
00:13:15,552 --> 00:13:16,752
With one foot on the ground,

400
00:13:17,152 --> 00:13:19,822
the knee must be straight when you take a step.

401
00:13:20,162 --> 00:13:21,692
What? The knee must be straight?

402
00:13:22,432 --> 00:13:23,831
You walk like this.

403
00:13:23,832 --> 00:13:25,131
Oh, I see.

404
00:13:25,132 --> 00:13:26,132
(Practicing right away)

405
00:13:26,133 --> 00:13:28,872
- While walking.
- Is this how to do it?

406
00:13:28,972 --> 00:13:30,601
Is this how to walk?

407
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:32,501
Yes, move more quickly. You're doing well.

408
00:13:32,502 --> 00:13:33,802
- Am I doing correctly?
- Yes.

409
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:35,671
You walk faster than I thought.

410
00:13:35,672 --> 00:13:37,341
- Are you okay?
- Straighten the knee more.

411
00:13:37,342 --> 00:13:38,482
Straighten the knee?

412
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:42,552
Stretching out the legs is important.

413
00:13:43,152 --> 00:13:45,581
You get a warning when your posture isn't correct.

414
00:13:45,582 --> 00:13:47,991
A whistle will blow for every warning.

415
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:50,921
You get disqualified with three warnings.

416
00:13:50,922 --> 00:13:52,222
Then you have to try again.

417
00:13:52,492 --> 00:13:53,692
I got it.

418
00:13:54,522 --> 00:13:55,732
Who wants to go first?

419
00:13:55,762 --> 00:13:57,461
- From here, - Shall I go?

420
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,502
- you start. I'll go next.
- Okay.

421
00:13:59,562 --> 00:14:01,871
- I'll go second, and you're last.
- Last?

422
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:03,172
I'll walk 100 meters.

423
00:14:03,332 --> 00:14:04,601
- Only 100 meters?
- Yes.

424
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:07,201
- Then I'll wait over there.
- Over there.

425
00:14:07,202 --> 00:14:09,471
Should I go over there? Gosh.

426
00:14:09,472 --> 00:14:10,472
(Tall Sang Uk will walk 200m out of 400m.)

427
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:12,311
Let's go.

428
00:14:12,312 --> 00:14:13,641
(They start the walking relay.)

429
00:14:13,642 --> 00:14:14,812
Let's do it.

430
00:14:15,752 --> 00:14:17,351
(Tae Hyun is in charge of the first 100m.)

431
00:14:17,352 --> 00:14:18,382
Attention.

432
00:14:18,652 --> 00:14:20,782
(Start)

433
00:14:23,252 --> 00:14:26,262
(His posture looks better than expected.)

434
00:14:27,192 --> 00:14:31,801
(Advancing step by step diligently)

435
00:14:31,802 --> 00:14:33,761
It makes your buttocks...

436
00:14:33,762 --> 00:14:35,232
stick out naturally.

437
00:14:36,472 --> 00:14:38,241
I didn't understand why before.

438
00:14:38,242 --> 00:14:39,801
It's necessary to walk faster.

439
00:14:39,802 --> 00:14:41,472
- Right?
- You have to move...

440
00:14:41,512 --> 00:14:43,512
the buttocks left and right to go fast.

441
00:14:44,042 --> 00:14:46,711
You got it. You look different from practice.

442
00:14:46,712 --> 00:14:48,811
- Sung Hoon, move your buttocks.
- How do you do it?

443
00:14:48,812 --> 00:14:49,812
Still...

444
00:14:50,612 --> 00:14:52,851
- How do you do it?
- He took 40 seconds.

445
00:14:52,852 --> 00:14:54,021
We won't make it.

446
00:14:54,022 --> 00:14:55,128
(Handing the baton without warning)

447
00:14:55,152 --> 00:14:56,851
That looks good.

448
00:14:56,852 --> 00:15:00,822
(Speeding up)

449
00:15:01,162 --> 00:15:02,432
He's practically running.

450
00:15:03,532 --> 00:15:05,132
It'll be tiring for Sang Uk.

451
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,501
I should have walked farther.

452
00:15:06,502 --> 00:15:07,902
(Handing the baton without warning)

453
00:15:08,632 --> 00:15:09,632
You can do it.

454
00:15:10,632 --> 00:15:11,741
I can do it.

455
00:15:11,742 --> 00:15:14,472
(The success depends on Sang Uk.)

456
00:15:16,042 --> 00:15:17,872
Sang Uk seems to walk slowly.

457
00:15:21,082 --> 00:15:24,311
(His wide strides make it look like he's moving slowly.)

458
00:15:24,312 --> 00:15:25,651
You can do it.

459
00:15:25,652 --> 00:15:27,151
(He turns the last corner.)

460
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:28,492
It's okay.

461
00:15:28,592 --> 00:15:30,522
Sang Uk,

462
00:15:30,552 --> 00:15:31,761
none of us got a warning.

463
00:15:31,762 --> 00:15:33,062
You can run a little.

464
00:15:33,622 --> 00:15:35,831
- Either way...
- That's right.

465
00:15:35,832 --> 00:15:37,461
We have two more chances.

466
00:15:37,462 --> 00:15:39,631
- Run.
- You can run twice.

467
00:15:39,632 --> 00:15:41,061
No!

468
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:42,401
No.

469
00:15:42,402 --> 00:15:44,071
You can run one more time.

470
00:15:44,072 --> 00:15:45,171
One more time.

471
00:15:45,172 --> 00:15:46,401
- One more time.
- One more time.

472
00:15:46,402 --> 00:15:47,842
Use it now.

473
00:15:47,972 --> 00:15:48,972
That's right.

474
00:15:48,973 --> 00:15:50,241
You can't do that.

475
00:15:50,242 --> 00:15:51,541
That's it.

476
00:15:51,542 --> 00:15:53,241
- Keep going.
- You can do it.

477
00:15:53,242 --> 00:15:54,542
You almost got it.

478
00:15:54,852 --> 00:15:57,452
Keep going.

479
00:15:58,752 --> 00:16:00,221
(They finished the 400m walking relay.)

480
00:16:00,222 --> 00:16:02,022
- That was great.
- Hey.

481
00:16:03,152 --> 00:16:05,661
- Good job.
- Goodness.

482
00:16:05,662 --> 00:16:06,662
(What will be the result?)

483
00:16:06,663 --> 00:16:07,862
Look at this.

484
00:16:08,032 --> 00:16:09,862
Here's your record.

485
00:16:11,332 --> 00:16:12,362
Two minutes...

486
00:16:13,462 --> 00:16:14,771
and seven seconds. It's a success.

487
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:16,032
We got it.

488
00:16:16,872 --> 00:16:18,471
- We made it.
- We did it.

489
00:16:18,472 --> 00:16:19,941
- Good job.
- By the way,

490
00:16:19,942 --> 00:16:21,101
you did a great job.

491
00:16:21,102 --> 00:16:22,711
(Victory due to strength, height, and tricks)

492
00:16:22,712 --> 00:16:23,972
You did an amazing job.

493
00:16:24,812 --> 00:16:27,441
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

494
00:16:27,442 --> 00:16:30,612
(Where's the next location for Team Guys that broke through fast?)

495
00:16:30,882 --> 00:16:32,152
Which one sounds delicious?

496
00:16:33,022 --> 00:16:34,221
Oh, right.

497
00:16:34,222 --> 00:16:35,622
Pick a dish that you'd like.

498
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:37,392
There's Jeongseon too.

499
00:16:37,952 --> 00:16:39,092
- Nearby?
- Yes.

500
00:16:39,692 --> 00:16:41,691
Shall we get kotdeungchigi in Jeongseon?

501
00:16:41,692 --> 00:16:43,831
- That sounds good.
- Anyway, pick a place...

502
00:16:43,832 --> 00:16:45,512
- where you want to eat.
- Let's go there.

503
00:16:46,002 --> 00:16:47,732
We'll get kotdeungchigi in Jeongseon.

504
00:16:48,272 --> 00:16:49,331
Let's go.

505
00:16:49,332 --> 00:16:52,742
(Both teams head to the same place.)

506
00:16:53,302 --> 00:16:54,871
(Team Handsome)

507
00:16:54,872 --> 00:16:56,372
We had to come to Jeongseon.

508
00:16:56,612 --> 00:16:57,672
It's so close.

509
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:00,511
(They arrive at the first restaurant quickly.)

510
00:17:00,512 --> 00:17:02,311
- Is this the place?
- Hello.

511
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,552
- Hello.
- Hello.

512
00:17:03,612 --> 00:17:04,982
- Hello.
- Hello.

513
00:17:05,782 --> 00:17:07,621
(At the entrance of Jeongseon Market, )

514
00:17:07,622 --> 00:17:10,922
(there's a famous Gangwon Province restaurant.)

515
00:17:12,692 --> 00:17:14,191
Kotdeungchigi guksu.

516
00:17:14,192 --> 00:17:15,992
(Jeongseon: Kotdeungchigi guksu)

517
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:18,631
(Noodles that you eat while hitting the nasal bridge)

518
00:17:18,632 --> 00:17:20,002
May we order?

519
00:17:20,162 --> 00:17:21,401
- Hello.
- Hello.

520
00:17:21,402 --> 00:17:25,071
Your kotdeungchigi guksu is very famous.

521
00:17:25,072 --> 00:17:28,671
- Can we get 1 mul and 1 bibim?
- Mul and bibim?

522
00:17:28,672 --> 00:17:31,041
Which can be served the quickest?

523
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:34,311
Since you're in Jeongseon, you should try rice with thistle.

524
00:17:34,312 --> 00:17:35,451
We'll get that too.

525
00:17:35,452 --> 00:17:37,412
- I'll bring your order soon.
- Thank you.

526
00:17:39,352 --> 00:17:42,021
Would it be bad to order assorted jeon?

527
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:43,792
Are you starting again?

528
00:17:43,992 --> 00:17:45,862
There's no protein.

529
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:47,862
Won't it be okay?

530
00:17:48,092 --> 00:17:49,861
You want it too? Go ahead.

531
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:52,232
- Can we get assorted jeon too?
- Darn it.

532
00:17:52,832 --> 00:17:55,002
We have to eat more and exercise too.

533
00:17:55,102 --> 00:17:56,602
Okay, assorted jeon.

534
00:17:57,172 --> 00:17:58,272
We have to win.

535
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:01,472
Based on the exercise they got...

536
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:03,841
For a walking relay,

537
00:18:03,842 --> 00:18:05,941
one try takes only two minutes.

538
00:18:05,942 --> 00:18:07,241
Right.

539
00:18:07,242 --> 00:18:08,611
As you said,

540
00:18:08,612 --> 00:18:10,782
they're likely to stop by Jeongseon.

541
00:18:11,082 --> 00:18:13,752
Can you open the blinds?

542
00:18:14,122 --> 00:18:16,822
So that I'll be able to notice if their car passes by.

543
00:18:17,592 --> 00:18:19,321
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

544
00:18:19,322 --> 00:18:20,392
Like that?

545
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:23,091
- May I serve you side dishes?
- Yes.

546
00:18:23,092 --> 00:18:25,002
- Thank you.
- The assorted jeon.

547
00:18:25,132 --> 00:18:26,201
All right.

548
00:18:26,202 --> 00:18:29,132
Sir, how old is this restaurant?

549
00:18:29,472 --> 00:18:32,002
My parents ran it for 15 years.

550
00:18:32,142 --> 00:18:33,572
I've run it for 15 years.

551
00:18:33,942 --> 00:18:35,511
- It's been about 30 years.
- Thirty years?

552
00:18:35,512 --> 00:18:36,842
It's close to 30 years.

553
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,042
What's this? It's cabbage jeon.

554
00:18:39,682 --> 00:18:40,981
Buckwheat crepe,

555
00:18:40,982 --> 00:18:43,581
millet pancake, and mung bean pancake.

556
00:18:43,582 --> 00:18:44,998
(Millet pancake, buckwheat crepe, cabbage jeon, mung bean pancake)

557
00:18:45,022 --> 00:18:47,351
The warm kotdeungchigi is...

558
00:18:47,352 --> 00:18:49,022
Please put it anywhere.

559
00:18:49,622 --> 00:18:52,791
Could you explain why it's called "kotdeungchigi?"

560
00:18:52,792 --> 00:18:55,362
It's noodles you eat while hitting your nasal ridge.

561
00:18:55,892 --> 00:18:58,462
- With the noodles?
- It's buckwheat noodles.

562
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,932
You must slurp them and hit your nasal ridge.

563
00:19:01,432 --> 00:19:02,671
The noodles are slightly thick.

564
00:19:02,672 --> 00:19:04,272
(Deciphering with the high speed camera)

565
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:06,501
(The noodles are elastic enough to hit the nasal bridge.)

566
00:19:06,502 --> 00:19:08,142
(Kotdeungchigi guksu)

567
00:19:08,412 --> 00:19:11,271
The crepe is unusual because it's cold.

568
00:19:11,272 --> 00:19:14,741
Think of enjoying refreshing kimchi inside.

569
00:19:14,742 --> 00:19:16,811
- The rest is eaten warm.
- Thank you.

570
00:19:16,812 --> 00:19:18,011
Enjoy your food.

571
00:19:18,012 --> 00:19:19,281
- Can we get extra plates?
- Can we get extra plates?

572
00:19:19,282 --> 00:19:20,282
Sure.

573
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:23,151
I'm grateful that Si Yang picked me today.

574
00:19:23,152 --> 00:19:25,322
It feels like I met my soulmate.

575
00:19:25,692 --> 00:19:28,432
(Planning to act as his soulmate)

576
00:19:31,532 --> 00:19:33,932
(Eating is in full swing.)

577
00:19:34,332 --> 00:19:36,002
The noodles are really thick.

578
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:38,402
I think they're handmade noodles.

579
00:19:48,852 --> 00:19:51,052
(The sound of slurping to hit the nasal ridge)

580
00:19:52,552 --> 00:19:53,712
Did you hit the nasal bridge?

581
00:19:53,952 --> 00:19:54,952
No,

582
00:19:54,953 --> 00:19:56,352
I'm wearing makeup.

583
00:19:59,762 --> 00:20:02,092
You could have, but you didn't because of your makeup?

584
00:20:09,032 --> 00:20:10,401
The noodles are thick.

585
00:20:10,402 --> 00:20:13,902
Buckwheat gives an excellent texture when you chew it.

586
00:20:13,942 --> 00:20:15,471
It's very chewy.

587
00:20:15,472 --> 00:20:17,042
It's extremely chewy.

588
00:20:17,272 --> 00:20:20,412
Ordinary buckwheat noodles break easily because they're thin.

589
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:23,152
The texture is very nice.

590
00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:29,521
(Buckwheat noodles made from scratch)

591
00:20:29,522 --> 00:20:32,192
(They're cooked in hot water.)

592
00:20:33,392 --> 00:20:36,092
(They're rinsed in cold water to keep them chewy.)

593
00:20:38,902 --> 00:20:43,502
(Dropped in the secret broth made with 15 types of vegetables)

594
00:20:46,542 --> 00:20:50,742
(Plump and chewy kotdeungchigi)

595
00:20:59,552 --> 00:21:00,852
Are you two brothers?

596
00:21:03,492 --> 00:21:05,491
(Copy)

597
00:21:05,492 --> 00:21:08,162
(Paste)

598
00:21:09,492 --> 00:21:11,192
You look like brothers.

599
00:21:15,702 --> 00:21:16,871
Both of you eat so well.

600
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:19,272
I haven't even tried bibim, but it's gone.

601
00:21:20,542 --> 00:21:21,712
Shall we order one more?

602
00:21:21,942 --> 00:21:23,142
Don't be ridiculous.

603
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:25,012
Order one more?

604
00:21:26,112 --> 00:21:27,681
(This time, it's rice with thistle.)

605
00:21:27,682 --> 00:21:28,882
The rice with thistle is nice.

606
00:21:29,852 --> 00:21:32,682
Try some rice with thistle. It's very savory.

607
00:21:33,252 --> 00:21:35,151
Si Yang, you eat so well.

608
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:36,722
I like to eat.

609
00:21:44,632 --> 00:21:46,562
It's similar to temple food.

610
00:21:46,602 --> 00:21:48,871
The cook who made this must run...

611
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:50,371
a fancy restaurant in Seoul.

612
00:21:50,372 --> 00:21:51,401
(Temple food at a fancy restaurant in Seoul)

613
00:21:51,402 --> 00:21:53,071
Temple food made by a monk at a temple.

614
00:21:53,072 --> 00:21:54,542
I see what you mean.

615
00:21:58,312 --> 00:21:59,482
What are they doing here?

616
00:22:00,542 --> 00:22:02,151
- They're coming out.
- They're coming in a row.

617
00:22:02,152 --> 00:22:03,251
Two vehicles?

618
00:22:03,252 --> 00:22:04,951
Since both of you are watching,

619
00:22:04,952 --> 00:22:06,582
I'll keep eating.

620
00:22:08,052 --> 00:22:10,051
I'm 100 percent sure. They stopped by.

621
00:22:10,052 --> 00:22:11,421
Pyeongchang... I mean, it's not Pyeongchang.

622
00:22:11,422 --> 00:22:13,521
They're here!

623
00:22:13,522 --> 00:22:15,061
- They're here.
- They're here.

624
00:22:15,062 --> 00:22:16,262
They're here.

625
00:22:17,562 --> 00:22:19,632
Seung Ho, they're here.

626
00:22:20,102 --> 00:22:21,231
I heard you.

627
00:22:21,232 --> 00:22:22,371
What did you say?

628
00:22:22,372 --> 00:22:24,932
(Laughing)

629
00:22:25,178 --> 00:22:26,547
(Team Guys)

630
00:22:26,548 --> 00:22:28,708
Tae Hyun, Jeongseon only takes five minutes from here.

631
00:22:29,078 --> 00:22:30,118
We should go.

632
00:22:30,148 --> 00:22:32,448
- It only takes 5 minutes?
- Yes, 5 minutes.

633
00:22:32,788 --> 00:22:34,217
- Here we go.
- Okay.

634
00:22:34,218 --> 00:22:35,457
Let's go.

635
00:22:35,458 --> 00:22:37,018
(They set off to Jeongseon right away.)

636
00:22:37,488 --> 00:22:39,727
If it only takes five minutes, the other team might be there.

637
00:22:39,728 --> 00:22:41,128
They're definitely there.

638
00:22:41,588 --> 00:22:44,198
If they already went there...

639
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:46,398
Won't it be better to go straight to Pyeongchang?

640
00:22:46,728 --> 00:22:48,768
- Then we should go to Pyeongchang.
- Yes.

641
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:53,107
- It's over here.
- Is it here?

642
00:22:53,108 --> 00:22:54,468
- Are we here?
- We're here.

643
00:22:55,168 --> 00:22:56,238
Right?

644
00:22:57,778 --> 00:23:00,278
- They're over there.
- Look on this side. They're here.

645
00:23:00,648 --> 00:23:01,847
- They're here.
- They're here.

646
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:03,448
The other team arrived first.

647
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:05,147
- Pyeongchang.
- Let's go to Pyeongchang.

648
00:23:05,148 --> 00:23:06,648
We'll head to Pyeongchang.

649
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,517
(Jeongseon: Kotdeungchigi guksu)

650
00:23:09,518 --> 00:23:11,488
- We're going to Pyeongchang.
- Okay.

651
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:15,227
We should've put some thumbtacks at the parking lot entrance.

652
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:16,904
(We should've put some thumbtacks at the parking lot entrance.)

653
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:19,268
Are you that much at ease?

654
00:23:20,598 --> 00:23:21,867
We lost one square.

655
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:23,798
After seeing us here, the other team left.

656
00:23:24,098 --> 00:23:25,268
By the way,

657
00:23:25,708 --> 00:23:26,937
this is delicious.

658
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,807
(By the way, this is delicious.)

659
00:23:28,808 --> 00:23:30,437
There's something we need to decide.

660
00:23:30,438 --> 00:23:32,948
Keeping the cuckoo alarm silent?

661
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,878
In my opinion, putting it on mute is the best.

662
00:23:35,918 --> 00:23:37,317
Let's do that.

663
00:23:37,318 --> 00:23:39,318
(Cuckoo on mute?)

664
00:23:39,648 --> 00:23:40,717
(The three were discussing what to wish for.)

665
00:23:40,718 --> 00:23:42,518
- I have an idea.
- Yes?

666
00:23:43,058 --> 00:23:46,258
Throughout the day, whenever we got the right answer,

667
00:23:46,588 --> 00:23:49,958
we could ask them not to set the alarm off.

668
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:52,398
- That's good.
- It would be frustrating.

669
00:23:52,828 --> 00:23:54,898
Yi Kyung, that's the right choice.

670
00:23:55,128 --> 00:23:56,698
They saw us here.

671
00:23:57,438 --> 00:23:58,637
If they don't hear the cuckoo,

672
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:00,337
they'd think that we failed.

673
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:02,038
They'll keep laughing at us.

674
00:24:03,438 --> 00:24:04,637
The wish card.

675
00:24:04,638 --> 00:24:06,047
(We'll use our wish card.)

676
00:24:06,048 --> 00:24:07,077
We'll use it.

677
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:08,248
Throughout today,

678
00:24:08,378 --> 00:24:10,548
even if we answer correctly,

679
00:24:10,678 --> 00:24:12,918
please keep the Handsome cuckoo...

680
00:24:13,348 --> 00:24:14,648
turned off.

681
00:24:15,718 --> 00:24:17,617
- Your card has been used.
- Is it done?

682
00:24:17,618 --> 00:24:18,857
Is the wish granted?

683
00:24:18,858 --> 00:24:20,288
(Your wish card has been used.)

684
00:24:20,888 --> 00:24:22,097
We have to exercise,

685
00:24:22,098 --> 00:24:23,828
- so we must get the right answer.
- Okay.

686
00:24:23,898 --> 00:24:25,568
Let's do the quiz.

687
00:24:26,328 --> 00:24:28,597
- Here's the quiz.
- Okay.

688
00:24:28,598 --> 00:24:30,038
(Time for Quiz)

689
00:24:31,068 --> 00:24:33,838
Kotdeungchigi guksu that you just ate has...

690
00:24:34,238 --> 00:24:36,778
noodles that are strong and elastic.

691
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:39,908
The name comes from the fact that they hit the nasal ridge.

692
00:24:40,048 --> 00:24:41,848
Kotdeungchigi guksu is...

693
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:46,017
also called kkoldu guksu.

694
00:24:46,018 --> 00:24:47,547
What does it mean?

695
00:24:47,548 --> 00:24:49,888
- Kkoldu?
- Kkoldu guksu.

696
00:24:50,918 --> 00:24:52,757
Let's think about this briefly.

697
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:55,658
Kkoldu makes us think of coming last place.

698
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:57,497
- Last place.
- Baby octopus.

699
00:24:57,498 --> 00:24:58,558
Baby octopus.

700
00:24:59,028 --> 00:25:01,568
Duruchigi. What else is there?

701
00:25:01,998 --> 00:25:03,998
A moment ago,

702
00:25:04,238 --> 00:25:05,537
the restaurant owner said...

703
00:25:05,538 --> 00:25:07,837
- that it's made with seaweed.
- Seaweed.

704
00:25:07,838 --> 00:25:09,077
We mostly use seaweed.

705
00:25:09,078 --> 00:25:10,238
- Seaweed?
- Seaweed.

706
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,007
Did they make the broth with baby octopus?

707
00:25:12,008 --> 00:25:14,448
(Did they make the broth with baby octopus?)

708
00:25:14,578 --> 00:25:16,947
- Jeongseon is inland.
- In Jeongseon...

709
00:25:16,948 --> 00:25:18,718
Kkoldu.

710
00:25:19,288 --> 00:25:20,948
I don't know what "kkol" means.

711
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:23,318
The shape of something.

712
00:25:23,918 --> 00:25:26,158
- The shape.
- Like an unpleasant sight?

713
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:28,958
Isn't "kkol" a negative word?

714
00:25:29,298 --> 00:25:32,398
- It's not a positive expression.
- Colloquially.

715
00:25:32,868 --> 00:25:34,067
Seeing someone...

716
00:25:34,068 --> 00:25:36,567
eating it is unpleasant.

717
00:25:36,568 --> 00:25:38,938
Or you give it to someone that you don't like.

718
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:40,768
- What? Yi Kyung...
- It could be...

719
00:25:41,538 --> 00:25:42,778
Did you come up with something?

720
00:25:43,138 --> 00:25:44,578
Dry and hard?

721
00:25:46,048 --> 00:25:47,208
Gosh.

722
00:25:47,278 --> 00:25:50,078
That sounds the most reasonable.

723
00:25:50,948 --> 00:25:52,017
It sounds reasonable.

724
00:25:52,018 --> 00:25:53,318
Because the noodles are strong?

725
00:25:53,388 --> 00:25:55,987
- They're strong and elastic.
- They're strong and elastic.

726
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:57,548
- Hard and dry.
- They're hard and dry.

727
00:25:57,688 --> 00:25:59,587
It's a little ambiguous.

728
00:25:59,588 --> 00:26:01,128
It has the same nuance.

729
00:26:02,058 --> 00:26:05,328
"Kkoldu" with hard and dry?

730
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:07,927
It could be because the noodles were made...

731
00:26:07,928 --> 00:26:09,268
- with a machine.
- Right.

732
00:26:10,438 --> 00:26:13,068
(Analyzing a noodle that survived)

733
00:26:13,768 --> 00:26:15,168
It's still hard and dry.

734
00:26:15,778 --> 00:26:17,008
It's still hard and dry.

735
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:19,848
It's strong and elastic.

736
00:26:19,908 --> 00:26:21,107
Let's go with hard and dry.

737
00:26:21,108 --> 00:26:23,078
- It was called kkoldu guksu.
- Of course.

738
00:26:23,318 --> 00:26:25,277
"Kkol" should be...

739
00:26:25,278 --> 00:26:27,618
I think we should think harder about it.

740
00:26:27,818 --> 00:26:30,717
"Hard and dry" only has the same nuance,

741
00:26:30,718 --> 00:26:32,557
but the rest doesn't work.

742
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:34,358
(Hard and dry)

743
00:26:34,628 --> 00:26:37,398
It's unpleasant to look at.

744
00:26:37,598 --> 00:26:40,328
Is it the person who's eating or the shape of the dish?

745
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,668
- The sight of someone eating.
- The sight?

746
00:26:43,498 --> 00:26:47,167
(The sight of his eating)

747
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:49,637
- It looks very gluttonous.
- Very gluttonous?

748
00:26:49,638 --> 00:26:52,038
(The sight of his eating is very gluttonous.)

749
00:26:52,648 --> 00:26:54,578
He splashes it everywhere.

750
00:26:55,718 --> 00:26:57,778
You know what made me angry?

751
00:26:57,918 --> 00:26:59,048
"Yi Kyung."

752
00:26:59,888 --> 00:27:03,188
When you devoured it because it was good,

753
00:27:03,258 --> 00:27:04,558
it was very annoying to look at.

754
00:27:05,288 --> 00:27:07,387
- Did you find that annoying?
- He ate so much.

755
00:27:07,388 --> 00:27:08,727
I didn't even get to taste it.

756
00:27:08,728 --> 00:27:10,197
- We tried...
- It was very annoying.

757
00:27:10,198 --> 00:27:11,898
To eat as modestly as possible.

758
00:27:12,058 --> 00:27:13,767
- It didn't work.
- I mean...

759
00:27:13,768 --> 00:27:15,714
- You should've told me.
- I didn't even get to taste it.

760
00:27:15,738 --> 00:27:16,937
- You should have let me know.
- In front of me...

761
00:27:16,938 --> 00:27:17,997
Then I'd have changed myself.

762
00:27:17,998 --> 00:27:19,707
You should've told us that we were unpleasant.

763
00:27:19,708 --> 00:27:21,767
He can't get his mind off of us eating unpleasantly,

764
00:27:21,768 --> 00:27:23,437
- so he keeps insisting.
- Really?

765
00:27:23,438 --> 00:27:25,008
You should go with that answer.

766
00:27:25,038 --> 00:27:26,278
- Let's give it a try.
- Okay.

767
00:27:26,948 --> 00:27:28,147
Answer.

768
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:29,217
(Answer)

769
00:27:29,218 --> 00:27:31,477
Yi Kyung, let's think for a few more seconds.

770
00:27:31,478 --> 00:27:33,187
If it's annoying to look...

771
00:27:33,188 --> 00:27:34,717
at someone eating the noodles...

772
00:27:34,718 --> 00:27:36,758
- You.
- Was it me?

773
00:27:36,918 --> 00:27:37,987
(He feels hurt.)

774
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:39,687
- I look nice when I eat.
- I don't think that's it.

775
00:27:39,688 --> 00:27:42,128
The way you were eating was very annoying.

776
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:43,598
Here's the answer.

777
00:27:43,898 --> 00:27:45,697
I got worked up again. It's because it's annoying to look at.

778
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:46,997
(Answer: Because it's annoying to look at)

779
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,627
- Is that your answer?
- Yes.

780
00:27:48,628 --> 00:27:49,967
(Answer: Because it's annoying to look at)

781
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,068
Correct.

782
00:27:51,438 --> 00:27:53,937
Was that correct? How is that possible?

783
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:55,068
Correct.

784
00:27:55,208 --> 00:27:57,908
Was that correct? How is that possible?

785
00:27:58,308 --> 00:27:59,478
Is this possible?

786
00:28:00,248 --> 00:28:01,478
Come over here.

787
00:28:01,608 --> 00:28:02,617
Is this possible?

788
00:28:02,618 --> 00:28:03,817
You're so annoying.

789
00:28:03,818 --> 00:28:04,878
Seriously?

790
00:28:05,078 --> 00:28:06,117
(He still can't believe it.)

791
00:28:06,118 --> 00:28:07,717
It means that...

792
00:28:07,718 --> 00:28:09,258
we gave you the answer.

793
00:28:11,288 --> 00:28:12,457
You're the best.

794
00:28:12,458 --> 00:28:13,558
(Feeling proud)

795
00:28:13,588 --> 00:28:14,927
- I thought...
- Is this possible?

796
00:28:14,928 --> 00:28:16,297
Here's the explanation.

797
00:28:16,298 --> 00:28:17,974
I kept saying that it was annoying to look at.

798
00:28:17,998 --> 00:28:20,068
You got the right answer by coincidence.

799
00:28:20,468 --> 00:28:22,097
When the times were difficult,

800
00:28:22,098 --> 00:28:24,537
they had to eat these noodles everyday.

801
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:26,384
That's why they didn't even want to look at them.

802
00:28:26,408 --> 00:28:27,737
You got the right answer,

803
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:29,377
- but you hurt our feelings.
- Right.

804
00:28:29,378 --> 00:28:30,908
I mean...

805
00:28:31,008 --> 00:28:32,607
I won't be able to eat with Yi Kyung anymore.

806
00:28:32,608 --> 00:28:33,928
We must've annoyed him very much.

807
00:28:34,808 --> 00:28:36,678
- Kkoldu guksu.
- Kkoldu guksu.

808
00:28:36,818 --> 00:28:37,877
Gosh, that's so annoying.

809
00:28:37,878 --> 00:28:42,717
(Jeongseon: Kotdeungchigi guksu)

810
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:44,318
Let's take a look at the exercise.

811
00:28:44,788 --> 00:28:46,188
One, two, three.

812
00:28:48,088 --> 00:28:49,998
Jegichagi?

813
00:28:50,198 --> 00:28:51,527
- We can do this.
- Can you?

814
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:52,597
- Are you good at it?
- We can do it.

815
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:53,727
Jegichagi, our total...

816
00:28:53,728 --> 00:28:55,167
- With 3 of us, - If it's 30...

817
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,438
doing 30 is a piece of cake.

818
00:28:56,698 --> 00:28:57,768
Is this the place?

819
00:28:58,368 --> 00:28:59,907
They prepared it where there's sunlight.

820
00:28:59,908 --> 00:29:01,008
It's warm.

821
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:03,207
(Team Handsome's time to exercise)

822
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,928
(Jegichagi, their total should be over 30.)

823
00:29:05,108 --> 00:29:07,048
It's important to finish it quickly.

824
00:29:07,248 --> 00:29:08,308
Hand me the jegi.

825
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:10,948
Since Seung Ho is the best, he should do 20.

826
00:29:11,348 --> 00:29:12,648
It'd be better if you can do 30.

827
00:29:15,248 --> 00:29:16,258
Now...

828
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,357
- The wind is in this direction.
- It's too light.

829
00:29:18,358 --> 00:29:19,458
I'll take any.

830
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:21,588
Give him one too.

831
00:29:22,398 --> 00:29:23,458
Does it work well?

832
00:29:25,658 --> 00:29:27,327
(Watching others do it makes him laugh.)

833
00:29:27,328 --> 00:29:28,868
- Ten...
- Hold on.

834
00:29:29,598 --> 00:29:31,638
(Taking off his scarf to get ready)

835
00:29:32,138 --> 00:29:35,068
(He pulls up one of his pants.)

836
00:29:35,638 --> 00:29:36,807
(I'll try.)

837
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,238
Seung Ho will go first.

838
00:29:38,708 --> 00:29:40,408
- Are we starting now?
- Do it right away.

839
00:29:40,908 --> 00:29:42,817
I'll try it. Can I do it here?

840
00:29:42,818 --> 00:29:44,178
Do it at a good spot.

841
00:29:45,018 --> 00:29:46,187
What do we do about the wind?

842
00:29:46,188 --> 00:29:47,347
(An ace in jegichagi, a former soccer player)

843
00:29:47,348 --> 00:29:49,487
One, two, three.

844
00:29:49,488 --> 00:29:50,488
(Failed)

845
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:51,588
What?

846
00:29:52,928 --> 00:29:54,628
(His 2nd attempt)

847
00:29:55,898 --> 00:29:57,527
(Failed)

848
00:29:57,528 --> 00:29:58,898
- Is it light?
- It's too light.

849
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,027
- Gosh.
- Hey.

850
00:30:01,028 --> 00:30:02,368
Let's start over.

851
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:05,038
- Hey.
- Why don't we do it together?

852
00:30:05,168 --> 00:30:06,907
Si Yang can do over 20.

853
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:07,908
Okay.

854
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:09,938
Si Yang, you should start. We'll go again.

855
00:30:10,338 --> 00:30:11,537
We'll start with Si Yang. One.

856
00:30:11,538 --> 00:30:12,908
- Gosh, I'll go again.
- Oh, no.

857
00:30:13,578 --> 00:30:15,047
(What's wrong with everyone?)

858
00:30:15,048 --> 00:30:16,217
I'll do it again.

859
00:30:16,218 --> 00:30:17,778
- I'm the one to start.
- You're right.

860
00:30:17,848 --> 00:30:18,947
(Their 4th attempt)

861
00:30:18,948 --> 00:30:20,788
The wind is... One, two,

862
00:30:20,948 --> 00:30:22,348
three, four,

863
00:30:22,758 --> 00:30:23,988
five, six,

864
00:30:24,258 --> 00:30:25,417
- seven, eight.
- Gosh.

865
00:30:25,418 --> 00:30:27,258
- Eight. It touched his foot.
- Eight.

866
00:30:27,958 --> 00:30:29,827
(So far, it's the best score.)

867
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,158
You just need to do 12.

868
00:30:32,028 --> 00:30:34,468
(Current: 8)

869
00:30:35,498 --> 00:30:37,237
Why is it going there as soon as I kick?

870
00:30:37,238 --> 00:30:38,268
Twelve.

871
00:30:39,168 --> 00:30:40,838
Yi Kyung, do 18 now.

872
00:30:41,638 --> 00:30:42,938
What do I do about the wind?

873
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:44,737
The wind?

874
00:30:44,738 --> 00:30:46,548
The jegi keeps flying off that way.

875
00:30:48,148 --> 00:30:50,748
(Actually, it's a big problem.)

876
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:52,547
It wasn't windy in the back.

877
00:30:52,548 --> 00:30:53,648
Can I do it here?

878
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:55,218
You can do it.

879
00:30:55,618 --> 00:30:57,517
- If I fail, let's start right away.
- Give that to me.

880
00:30:57,518 --> 00:30:59,487
Do you prefer to hold it?

881
00:30:59,488 --> 00:31:00,527
I'll keep it.

882
00:31:00,528 --> 00:31:01,928
(Current: 12)

883
00:31:02,698 --> 00:31:03,698
Two.

884
00:31:04,598 --> 00:31:06,367
It's okay. We can start over.

885
00:31:06,368 --> 00:31:08,727
- Start right away.
- Start right away.

886
00:31:08,728 --> 00:31:10,568
(He practices again.)

887
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:15,568
- Gosh.
- Seung Ho played soccer.

888
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:17,914
It's easier for him to kick with the top of his foot.

889
00:31:17,938 --> 00:31:19,007
Use the wide part.

890
00:31:19,008 --> 00:31:20,008
(Sighing)

891
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:21,807
The wide part is better. Two.

892
00:31:21,808 --> 00:31:22,847
That's it. Three.

893
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:24,317
He kicks like this instinctively.

894
00:31:24,318 --> 00:31:26,838
(The former soccer player kicks jegi with the top of his foot.)

895
00:31:27,188 --> 00:31:28,748
He's so annoying to watch.

896
00:31:28,948 --> 00:31:31,458
Doing 30 isn't normally difficult.

897
00:31:31,718 --> 00:31:34,028
I've done 50 jegichagi in 1 try.

898
00:31:34,328 --> 00:31:35,328
(Do at least 10 each.)

899
00:31:35,528 --> 00:31:37,458
(Please)

900
00:31:37,758 --> 00:31:39,497
- Are you starting?
- Yes.

901
00:31:39,498 --> 00:31:40,768
(Their 5th attempt)

902
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:44,968
Doing 30 isn't normally difficult.

903
00:31:46,108 --> 00:31:47,708
- Here we go.
- One, two,

904
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,208
three, four,

905
00:31:49,578 --> 00:31:52,038
five, six, seven, eight.

906
00:31:52,378 --> 00:31:54,378
It's doable.

907
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:57,718
- Should I go first?
- You play it with stability.

908
00:31:57,878 --> 00:31:59,148
You have to do many.

909
00:31:59,348 --> 00:32:00,517
The wind is blowing all of a sudden.

910
00:32:00,518 --> 00:32:01,817
Did Seung Ho do eight?

911
00:32:01,818 --> 00:32:03,117
- Yes, eight.
- Eight.

912
00:32:03,118 --> 00:32:04,317
(Current: 8)

913
00:32:04,318 --> 00:32:05,718
Nine, ten,

914
00:32:06,088 --> 00:32:08,658
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,

915
00:32:08,788 --> 00:32:10,998
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen...

916
00:32:11,958 --> 00:32:14,268
(If Yi Kyung kicks over 13, they will succeed.)

917
00:32:15,728 --> 00:32:17,138
Nineteen, twenty,

918
00:32:17,468 --> 00:32:18,988
- twenty-one, twenty-two, - We got it.

919
00:32:19,068 --> 00:32:21,567
Twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five,

920
00:32:21,568 --> 00:32:23,137
twenty-six, twenty-seven...

921
00:32:23,138 --> 00:32:24,708
(We only have 3 left.)

922
00:32:25,038 --> 00:32:29,078
(Will he succeed?)

923
00:32:29,378 --> 00:32:30,994
- Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, - We got it.

924
00:32:31,018 --> 00:32:32,048
Thirty.

925
00:32:32,148 --> 00:32:34,217
- We're done.
- That's it.

926
00:32:34,218 --> 00:32:35,287
- You're done.
- Okay.

927
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:36,788
- Okay.
- Okay.

928
00:32:37,388 --> 00:32:38,718
- Yes.
- Yes.

929
00:32:39,388 --> 00:32:40,828
- We need to go.
- Let's go.

930
00:32:42,758 --> 00:32:45,498
To eat Hamheung naengmyeon,

931
00:32:46,198 --> 00:32:47,968
we'll go to Sokcho A.

932
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:50,368
See you in Sokcho. Let's go to Sokcho.

933
00:32:51,098 --> 00:32:52,137
Let's go.

934
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:54,068
(Let's go to Sokcho.)

935
00:32:54,338 --> 00:32:56,577
There's a big release of dopamine.

936
00:32:56,578 --> 00:32:58,278
- It's crazy.
- Of course.

937
00:32:58,608 --> 00:33:00,508
We got a release of dopamine.

938
00:33:00,908 --> 00:33:02,078
This is fun.

939
00:33:02,678 --> 00:33:04,477
(Laughing)

940
00:33:04,478 --> 00:33:05,817
- Isn't it fun?
- It's very fun.

941
00:33:05,818 --> 00:33:06,818
Of course, it is.

942
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:07,987
(They're absorbed in the race.)

943
00:33:07,988 --> 00:33:09,517
Our idea was excellent.

944
00:33:09,518 --> 00:33:11,918
Putting the cuckoo on mute.

945
00:33:12,828 --> 00:33:16,157
They may expect the alarm to go off by now, but it hasn't yet.

946
00:33:16,158 --> 00:33:18,428
- So they'll think that we failed.
- Right.

947
00:33:18,558 --> 00:33:20,127
They won't even imagine...

948
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,468
what we wished for.

949
00:33:21,628 --> 00:33:23,268
Without knowing anything,

950
00:33:23,438 --> 00:33:26,307
when they suddenly hear Yi Kyung sing "Leave Work on Time,"

951
00:33:26,308 --> 00:33:27,737
- they'll lose their mind.
- Right.

952
00:33:27,738 --> 00:33:28,738
(This is so fun.)

953
00:33:28,739 --> 00:33:30,278
We can put them to sleep.

954
00:33:30,438 --> 00:33:32,277
On top of that, we're being stealthy.

955
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:34,048
Yes, we're using everything that we got.

956
00:33:34,108 --> 00:33:35,407
They're getting...

957
00:33:35,408 --> 00:33:36,717
- all the possible stress.
- Right.

958
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:38,438
- Once we use the next card we have?
- Yes.

959
00:33:38,748 --> 00:33:41,148
Muting of the alarm will take effect...

960
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:44,218
when we get to where all the cities are.

961
00:33:44,518 --> 00:33:46,187
- Yes.
- That's when it will shine.

962
00:33:46,188 --> 00:33:47,908
(The other team won't know where they won.)

963
00:33:47,958 --> 00:33:49,557
Since you picked the invisibility cloak,

964
00:33:49,558 --> 00:33:50,998
you have luck.

965
00:33:51,798 --> 00:33:53,628
Jegal Seung Ho has the brain.

966
00:33:54,928 --> 00:33:56,737
Yi Kyung has it all right now.

967
00:33:56,738 --> 00:33:58,668
Yes, he's perfect in every way.

968
00:33:59,408 --> 00:34:01,437
He has all the capacities.

969
00:34:01,438 --> 00:34:02,907
(Driving, intelligence, luck, eloquence, looks)

970
00:34:02,908 --> 00:34:04,338
Yi Kyung is leading us to victory.

971
00:34:04,608 --> 00:34:06,207
No way, I only won once.

972
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,448
We should do more quizzes.

973
00:34:08,008 --> 00:34:10,718
While we head to Sokcho A,

974
00:34:11,148 --> 00:34:13,887
whether the alarm goes off in Pyeongchang will be important.

975
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,017
Right.

976
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:16,387
(How will Team Guys counterattack self-praising Team Handsome?)

977
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,388
(Team Guys is moving diligently.)

978
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,388
It's about time the alarm went off.

979
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:21,588
I know.

980
00:34:21,688 --> 00:34:23,727
When we were busy with the walking relay,

981
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,398
- they had already started eating.
- Right.

982
00:34:26,828 --> 00:34:30,137
There are two reasons why we didn't hear the cuckoo.

983
00:34:30,138 --> 00:34:32,397
Either they gave up and left,

984
00:34:32,398 --> 00:34:34,608
or they got it wrong again.

985
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:36,754
- They got it wrong after using it.
- After using the card?

986
00:34:36,778 --> 00:34:38,137
If they got it wrong after using the card...

987
00:34:38,138 --> 00:34:39,654
They got it wrong after using the card?

988
00:34:39,678 --> 00:34:41,247
That's possible.

989
00:34:41,248 --> 00:34:43,917
- That gives us an advantage.
- Of course,

990
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,417
but I don't know if it makes sense.

991
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:47,718
(If it's true...)

992
00:34:48,218 --> 00:34:49,988
We can move comfortably.

993
00:34:50,358 --> 00:34:54,058
Should we go somewhere to ski briefly?

994
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:56,628
Now that we're here...

995
00:34:56,858 --> 00:35:00,227
- I've never skied in Korea.
- In Korea?

996
00:35:00,228 --> 00:35:02,427
- Since it's snowing...
- Sledding?

997
00:35:02,428 --> 00:35:05,638
We can go sledding and have fun.

998
00:35:05,768 --> 00:35:07,867
When will we ever come back here?

999
00:35:07,868 --> 00:35:09,677
We should eat delicious food...

1000
00:35:09,678 --> 00:35:11,338
- Gosh.
- and have fun.

1001
00:35:12,238 --> 00:35:14,577
If we get cold from skiing, we can go to a sauna.

1002
00:35:14,578 --> 00:35:16,978
(Team Guys feels relaxed from not hearing the cuckoo sound.)

1003
00:35:17,178 --> 00:35:18,248
This is it.

1004
00:35:19,748 --> 00:35:21,818
- It's here.
- Is this it?

1005
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:24,457
- I think this is it.
- It's here.

1010
00:35:34,428 --> 00:35:37,097
On our way here, I saw "master" somewhere.

1011
00:35:37,098 --> 00:35:39,637
I don't know much about anything else...

1012
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,607
except buckwheat.

(Master of buckwheat noodles, Oh Sook Hi)

1014
00:35:43,138 --> 00:35:46,308
Isn't there a lot of buckwheat in Bongpyeong?

1015
00:35:46,408 --> 00:35:49,847
In Bongpyeong, thanks to Writer Lee Hyo Seok's...

1016

"When Buckwheat Flowers Bloom,"

1017

- buckwheat became very famous.
- "When Buckwheat Flowers Bloom?"

1018
00:35:53,448 --> 00:35:54,587
- Yes.
- I see.

1019
00:35:54,588 --> 00:35:58,088
We use both bitter buckwheat...

1020
00:35:58,488 --> 00:35:59,828
and sweet buckwheat.

1021
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:02,487
We mix the two.

1022
00:36:02,488 --> 00:36:04,697
Is there a bitter type and a sweet type?

1023
00:36:04,698 --> 00:36:07,568
These days, the bitter type from plant breeding...

1024
00:36:08,028 --> 00:36:10,638
is 50 times more nutritious than the sweet type.

1025
00:36:12,068 --> 00:36:13,068
- I can't wait.
- Today,

1026
00:36:13,069 --> 00:36:16,907
instead of reading the menu, try my recommendation.

1027

- So...
- We'd like that.

1028
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:20,547
- What should we try?
- Also, beef tartare.

1029
00:36:20,548 --> 00:36:22,247
- Can we get beef tartare?
- Beef tartare.

1030
00:36:22,248 --> 00:36:23,818
Our beef tartare is to die for.

1031
00:36:24,548 --> 00:36:26,647
- Okay.
- You recommend beef tartare.

1032
00:36:26,648 --> 00:36:28,247
I need beef tartare no matter what.

1033

- I'm sorry.
- He wants...

- Please wait a minute.
- Okay.

1035
00:36:31,118 --> 00:36:32,118
Okay.

- Gosh.

- Really?
- Yes.

1042
00:36:44,532 --> 00:36:45,862

1051
00:37:14,062 --> 00:37:16,861
of the green thing you find at a tuna restaurant.

- There's a nutty flavor.

Ma'am, this is delicious.

1070
00:38:02,602 --> 00:38:03,741
(Buckwheat noodles that are bitter and sweet)

1071
00:38:03,742 --> 00:38:05,542
- No wonder people line up.
- Check this out.

1072
00:38:05,712 --> 00:38:08,612
Rather than dipping it in the broth,

1073
00:38:08,842 --> 00:38:10,251
- try some of it as is.
- At first.

1074
00:38:10,252 --> 00:38:11,912
Right. Give it a try.

1075
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:15,282
Here. Try this.

1076
00:38:15,882 --> 00:38:16,951
- This is incredible.
- I know.

1077
00:38:16,952 --> 00:38:19,922
(Trying the buckwheat noodles as is)

1078
00:38:20,162 --> 00:38:21,692
I should try it as is too.

1079
00:38:26,732 --> 00:38:27,832
To that,

1080
00:38:28,762 --> 00:38:30,731
drizzle some vinegar.

1081
00:38:30,732 --> 00:38:32,332
That will make it even better.

1082
00:38:32,672 --> 00:38:34,002
- Vinegar?
- Yes.

1083
00:38:36,512 --> 00:38:41,312
(Adding vinegar to taste)

1084
00:38:47,282 --> 00:38:51,492
(The freshness of the vinegar enhances the taste of the noodles.)

1085
00:38:55,422 --> 00:38:58,032
I'll now dunk these.

1086
00:38:58,432 --> 00:38:59,862
Are you supposed to dunk them in?

1087
00:39:00,432 --> 00:39:02,001
You can enjoy it like this.

1088
00:39:02,002 --> 00:39:03,731
These are actually served in the broth.

1089
00:39:03,732 --> 00:39:04,901
- Yes.
- That's right.

1090
00:39:04,902 --> 00:39:07,462
(How to enjoy buckwheat noodles: 3. Soak noodles in cold broth.)

1091
00:39:12,672 --> 00:39:15,711
(Slurping)

1092
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,382
I can taste the bitterness.

1093
00:39:17,782 --> 00:39:21,181
Now, this is our signature dish.

1094
00:39:21,182 --> 00:39:22,281
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1095
00:39:22,282 --> 00:39:24,651
You should've served this first.

1096
00:39:24,652 --> 00:39:26,121
Since this is the signature dish,

1097
00:39:26,122 --> 00:39:28,791
I had to serve this last.

1098
00:39:28,792 --> 00:39:30,392
- As the highlight of this meal.
- Okay.

1099
00:39:30,532 --> 00:39:31,761
How do we eat this?

1100
00:39:31,762 --> 00:39:33,302
On top is beef tartare.

1101
00:39:34,132 --> 00:39:37,372
(Gently topped with beef tartare)

1102
00:39:37,632 --> 00:39:40,202
(Buckwheat sprouts are the icing on the cake.)

1103
00:39:42,772 --> 00:39:45,272
(The signature buckwheat noodles with beef tartare)

1104
00:39:45,842 --> 00:39:47,911
In Japanese, this is called soba.

1105
00:39:47,912 --> 00:39:48,942
That's right.

1106
00:39:52,152 --> 00:39:56,621
(They're already enjoying their fourth dish.)

1107
00:39:56,622 --> 00:40:01,322
(They're already enjoying their fourth dish.)

1108
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:16,812
(Even the meat-lovers have fallen for buckwheat noodles.)

1109
00:40:17,942 --> 00:40:19,842
My gosh, this is...

1110
00:40:20,812 --> 00:40:22,012
How is this buckwheat noodles?

1111
00:40:22,212 --> 00:40:24,482
I never thought I'd be served a dish like this.

1112
00:40:24,652 --> 00:40:25,882
Yes, and it's good.

1113
00:40:27,252 --> 00:40:29,722
(They can't stop eating.)

1114
00:40:34,692 --> 00:40:36,892
This was unexpected.

1115
00:40:37,462 --> 00:40:40,101
- It's good.
- Will this be the theme today?

1116
00:40:40,102 --> 00:40:41,802
(Highly satisfied)

1117
00:40:43,332 --> 00:40:45,601
I forgot the most basic thing which is water.

1118
00:40:45,602 --> 00:40:46,602
Gosh, no.

1119
00:40:46,603 --> 00:40:48,541
If so, you could give us some more beef tartare.

1120
00:40:48,542 --> 00:40:50,011
Beef tartare? Just a second.

1121
00:40:50,012 --> 00:40:52,532
(He orders more beef tartare like it's the most natural thing.)

1122
00:40:55,342 --> 00:40:56,512
He's at it again.

1123
00:40:57,782 --> 00:40:59,151
Have this while you wait.

1124
00:40:59,152 --> 00:41:00,281
No, it'll be here.

1125
00:41:00,282 --> 00:41:01,582
(I ordered another dish.)

1126
00:41:01,922 --> 00:41:03,691
Thank you for saying it's tasty.

1127
00:41:03,692 --> 00:41:06,022
- It's really good.
- The food is incredible.

1128
00:41:07,292 --> 00:41:08,521
My gosh.

1129
00:41:08,522 --> 00:41:10,561
(The hunt for meat recommences.)

1130
00:41:10,562 --> 00:41:11,762
The buckwheat noodles...

1131
00:41:12,162 --> 00:41:16,132
(Instinctively hunting meat)

1132
00:41:16,262 --> 00:41:18,301
Isn't buckwheat easy to digest?

1133
00:41:18,302 --> 00:41:21,502
(There was beef tartare, but now it's gone.)

1134
00:41:23,042 --> 00:41:24,671
Sung Hoon, I doubt...

1135
00:41:24,672 --> 00:41:26,111
you want to eat naengmyeon...

1136
00:41:26,112 --> 00:41:27,592
right after having buckwheat noodles.

1137
00:41:27,982 --> 00:41:28,982
Exactly.

1138
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:32,411
The same goes for dongchimi makguksu.

1139
00:41:32,412 --> 00:41:33,681
- I don't want that either.
- Right.

1140
00:41:33,682 --> 00:41:34,722
(Firmly)

1141
00:41:35,122 --> 00:41:36,122
Got it.

1142
00:41:36,123 --> 00:41:37,751
We should have something warm, then.

1143
00:41:37,752 --> 00:41:38,991
- I'd like that.
- Like jjamppong.

1144
00:41:38,992 --> 00:41:40,391
Jjamppong. Yes, let's have that.

1145
00:41:40,392 --> 00:41:42,322
(I like the sound of jjamppong.)

1146
00:41:42,692 --> 00:41:44,431
- Then...
- Jjamppong it is.

1147
00:41:44,432 --> 00:41:47,931
We'll give up on scoring a bingo and go to Gangneung.

1148
00:41:47,932 --> 00:41:49,001
It's not that we can't.

1149
00:41:49,002 --> 00:41:50,478
- We're just choosing not to.
- Right.

1150
00:41:50,502 --> 00:41:52,471
I like that it's simple. If we get this right,

1151
00:41:52,472 --> 00:41:53,671
we'll go have jjamppong.

1152
00:41:53,672 --> 00:41:54,672
Sounds good.

1153
00:41:55,102 --> 00:41:56,912
This turned into a menu.

1154
00:41:58,372 --> 00:42:00,481
- Thank you for today.
- Thank you.

1155
00:42:00,482 --> 00:42:02,311
- Everything was amazing.
- I'll hang this up.

1156
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:03,282
(Time for Quiz)

1157
00:42:03,283 --> 00:42:04,582
Here's your question.

1158
00:42:05,582 --> 00:42:07,882
Our ancestors believed buckwheat...

1159
00:42:08,022 --> 00:42:12,022
to be a sacred creature that had five colors to it...

1160
00:42:12,252 --> 00:42:14,991
which is why it was given the name "obangjiyeongmul."

1161
00:42:14,992 --> 00:42:16,831
Unbelievable. Obang...

1162
00:42:16,832 --> 00:42:18,891
- Jiyeokmul?
- No, jiyeong.

1163
00:42:18,892 --> 00:42:20,102
- Jiyeongmul?
- Mul.

1164
00:42:20,632 --> 00:42:22,608
- This is tough.
- We need the Chinese characters.

1165
00:42:22,632 --> 00:42:23,871
I'm clueless.

1166
00:42:23,872 --> 00:42:25,278
(The one who's not needed for quizzes is upset to be clueless.)

1167
00:42:25,302 --> 00:42:27,771
Having five colors means that in the literal sense.

1168
00:42:27,772 --> 00:42:29,842
- Right.
- It has five colors.

1169
00:42:30,642 --> 00:42:33,942
Out of the five colors, the leaf is what's green,

1170
00:42:34,012 --> 00:42:35,812
the flower is what's white,

1171
00:42:35,942 --> 00:42:38,412
and the grain is what's black.

1172
00:42:38,852 --> 00:42:40,852
- The grain.
- Then,

1173
00:42:40,952 --> 00:42:44,492
what was red and what was yellow?

1174
00:42:45,652 --> 00:42:48,392
- Do we need to guess both?
- Yes, both.

1175
00:42:48,992 --> 00:42:50,391
Why do we need to get two...

1176
00:42:50,392 --> 00:42:51,791
- when it should be one question?
- Exactly.

1177
00:42:51,792 --> 00:42:53,062
- I know.
- The audacity.

1178
00:42:53,702 --> 00:42:55,461
- Right?
- I agree.

1179
00:42:55,462 --> 00:42:57,378
- Are you kidding me?
- We're supposed to get two?

1180
00:42:57,402 --> 00:43:01,241
Five colors can be seen from the buckwheat plant.

1181
00:43:01,242 --> 00:43:02,342
That's right.

1182
00:43:03,342 --> 00:43:05,642
Let's go over a plant's anatomy.

1183
00:43:06,072 --> 00:43:07,482
What else is there?

1184
00:43:10,452 --> 00:43:11,611
The tree.

1185
00:43:11,612 --> 00:43:12,751
(Concentrating on the buckwheat grain)

1186
00:43:12,752 --> 00:43:14,122
Fire and water.

1187
00:43:14,682 --> 00:43:15,882
What do you call this?

1188
00:43:16,252 --> 00:43:17,751
- A buckwheat sprout.
- Buckwheat.

1189
00:43:17,752 --> 00:43:19,861
The buckwheat sprout. Could it be that?

1190
00:43:19,862 --> 00:43:21,622
- The sprout?
- Yes, it's yellow.

1191
00:43:22,092 --> 00:43:24,092
- It can be the sprout.
- Right?

1192
00:43:24,762 --> 00:43:26,662
- The buckwheat sprout.
- Here. The sprout.

1193
00:43:27,032 --> 00:43:29,462
- That must be what's yellow.
- Right.

1194
00:43:30,602 --> 00:43:33,002
If we get this right, it'll be you who...

1195
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,572
Find what's red.

1196
00:43:35,542 --> 00:43:38,272
- It can be the sprout.
- Normally, the sprout grows...

1197
00:43:38,612 --> 00:43:40,012
to become a plant.

1198
00:43:41,882 --> 00:43:43,011
The sprout grows.

1199
00:43:43,012 --> 00:43:45,211
(Dumb and Dumber)

1200
00:43:45,212 --> 00:43:47,982
(Laughing)

1201
00:43:50,122 --> 00:43:52,191
- What does the plant look like?
- What does it look like?

1202
00:43:52,192 --> 00:43:54,261
They serve dishes made with buckwheat noodles.

1203
00:43:54,262 --> 00:43:56,022
Shouldn't there be a photo or drawing of it?

1204
00:43:56,222 --> 00:43:57,461
Come on.

1205
00:43:57,462 --> 00:43:58,862
Isn't it on the menu?

1206
00:44:00,802 --> 00:44:02,062
Seriously.

1207
00:44:03,002 --> 00:44:04,571
There has to be something here.

1208
00:44:04,572 --> 00:44:06,432
(They failed to obtain any clues.)

1209
00:44:07,072 --> 00:44:09,441
I think we were asked to answer two things...

1210
00:44:09,442 --> 00:44:11,641
because the two are linked somehow.

1211
00:44:11,642 --> 00:44:13,412
The leaves are what's green.

1212
00:44:13,842 --> 00:44:15,382
Let's take a look at a plant.

1213
00:44:16,082 --> 00:44:18,181
It'll look like this...

1214
00:44:18,182 --> 00:44:19,781
- with a flower.
- That's right.

1215
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,451
- It's like this.
- Right.

1216
00:44:21,452 --> 00:44:23,621
- Here's the flower.
- Right.

1217
00:44:23,622 --> 00:44:25,791
- The leaves.
- Yes.

1218
00:44:25,792 --> 00:44:28,091
- What's left is the stem.
- Right.

1219
00:44:28,092 --> 00:44:30,761
- And the roots.
- Exactly.

1220
00:44:30,762 --> 00:44:32,431
Wouldn't it be something like that?

1221
00:44:32,432 --> 00:44:34,701
- I agree.
- Right?

1222
00:44:34,702 --> 00:44:36,101
If we take the simple approach,

1223
00:44:36,102 --> 00:44:38,272
what's yellow can be the stem.

1224
00:44:38,572 --> 00:44:41,172
If this is the root, I mean. We only have two options.

1225
00:44:41,702 --> 00:44:42,948
If this is what the plant looks like.

1226
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:44,971
I don't know what a buckwheat plant looks like.

1227
00:44:44,972 --> 00:44:46,982
I'm just as clueless.

1228
00:44:47,012 --> 00:44:49,182
I'm okay with...

1229
00:44:49,212 --> 00:44:51,181
- the stem being yellow, - Right.

1230
00:44:51,182 --> 00:44:52,712
But red roots?

1231
00:44:53,152 --> 00:44:54,981
That's all I can think of right now.

1232
00:44:54,982 --> 00:44:57,992
What else is there apart from a stem and roots?

1233
00:44:58,492 --> 00:44:59,521
Shall we go with it?

1234
00:44:59,522 --> 00:45:01,061
(They want to answer since they can't think of anything else.)

1235
00:45:01,062 --> 00:45:03,508
- We can't think of anything else.
- We'll use the reattempt card.

1236
00:45:03,532 --> 00:45:04,962
Roots can't be red.

1237
00:45:05,492 --> 00:45:06,901
- Go ahead.
- Let me see.

1238
00:45:06,902 --> 00:45:08,961
- What's red are the roots.
- The roots.

1239
00:45:08,962 --> 00:45:10,872
- What's yellow is the stem.
- The stem.

1240
00:45:12,002 --> 00:45:15,572
All right. What's red are the roots and what's yellow is the stem.

1241
00:45:16,072 --> 00:45:17,542
What else is there to it?

1242
00:45:19,712 --> 00:45:21,142
- Incorrect.
- See?

1243
00:45:22,642 --> 00:45:24,551
Let's use the reattempt card.

1244
00:45:24,552 --> 00:45:26,551
We have to since it's the middle square.

1245
00:45:26,552 --> 00:45:27,651
We must.

1246
00:45:27,652 --> 00:45:29,722
We kept thinking but those were the only options.

1247
00:45:29,822 --> 00:45:32,592
Would we be able to get it right even with a hint?

1248
00:45:33,092 --> 00:45:34,321
Here's your hint.

1249
00:45:34,322 --> 00:45:38,161
You should first tell us if either was right.

1250
00:45:38,162 --> 00:45:40,062
(Roaring)

1251
00:45:40,162 --> 00:45:42,362
- Check out the hint first.
- Okay.

1252
00:45:43,102 --> 00:45:45,632
Here's your hint. One is the stem...

1253
00:45:47,142 --> 00:45:50,272
- while the other is the root.
- Darn.

1254
00:45:52,172 --> 00:45:54,641
Are you kidding me? We got the answer!

1255
00:45:54,642 --> 00:45:57,352
We could've gotten on the sleighs!

1256
00:45:57,482 --> 00:45:58,681
(Dispirited)

1257
00:45:58,682 --> 00:45:59,852
Darn.

1258
00:46:00,782 --> 00:46:02,482
The stem is what's red.

1259
00:46:03,422 --> 00:46:05,792
Aren't the roots normally reddish?

1260
00:46:07,062 --> 00:46:08,391
I haven't seen reddish roots before.

1261
00:46:08,392 --> 00:46:11,061
- What about red stems?
- I haven't seen those either.

1262
00:46:11,062 --> 00:46:12,062
Of course not.

1263
00:46:12,292 --> 00:46:13,732
What a waste.

1264
00:46:15,502 --> 00:46:17,072
I can't believe it.

1265
00:46:17,302 --> 00:46:18,631
We can't get on the sleighs.

1266
00:46:18,632 --> 00:46:20,172
(Buckwheat has Tae Hyun crying.)

1267
00:46:20,442 --> 00:46:22,571
- We don't have to answer it.
- Well...

1268
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:25,211
- Right? Gosh.
- At least give us an answer.

1269
00:46:25,212 --> 00:46:26,782
We had it.

1270
00:46:27,282 --> 00:46:29,881
- Red stem, yellow...
- The other way around.

1271
00:46:29,882 --> 00:46:30,882
- roots.
- Roots.

1272
00:46:32,612 --> 00:46:34,521
- You're scaring me.
- Shoot.

1273
00:46:34,522 --> 00:46:36,451
- What a waste!
- I know.

1274
00:46:36,452 --> 00:46:38,152
- That is correct.
- Darn.

1275
00:46:38,452 --> 00:46:40,621
- Let's see what it looks like.
- I'm not happy at all.

1276
00:46:40,622 --> 00:46:41,662
Buckwheat.

1277
00:46:41,722 --> 00:46:42,791
Let's take a look.

1278
00:46:42,792 --> 00:46:43,831
(Self-studying)

1279
00:46:43,832 --> 00:46:46,392
The stem seems reddish.

1280
00:46:46,732 --> 00:46:49,501
- How could we know that?
- Tell me about it.

1281
00:46:49,502 --> 00:46:51,472
- It's red for sure.
- What's that?

1282
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,471
(Black grains, white flowers, green leaves, red stems, yellow roots)

1283
00:46:55,472 --> 00:46:58,072
- The stems are red.
- How stupid am I?

1284
00:46:59,212 --> 00:47:01,282
It's so annoying!

1285
00:47:01,642 --> 00:47:04,551
Since we're annoyed, let's go on the sleighs.

1286
00:47:04,552 --> 00:47:06,951
Why don't we leave feeling better?

1287
00:47:06,952 --> 00:47:08,552
(I can't believe him.)

1288
00:47:10,292 --> 00:47:13,461
Before going on the sleighs, you have to engage in sports.

1289
00:47:13,462 --> 00:47:14,622
That we should.

1290
00:47:16,592 --> 00:47:19,591
(Pyeongchang: Buckwheat noodles)

1291
00:47:19,592 --> 00:47:20,961
I'm sad.

1292
00:47:20,962 --> 00:47:23,302
- I'm sad.
- This is ridiculous.

1293
00:47:24,172 --> 00:47:26,402
(Team Handsome)

1294
00:47:26,572 --> 00:47:28,771
(Cuckoo)

1295
00:47:28,772 --> 00:47:30,671
- Pyeongchang.
- I told you.

1296
00:47:30,672 --> 00:47:31,771
They went to Pyeongchang.

1297
00:47:31,772 --> 00:47:33,841
We ought to go straight to Sokcho, then.

1298
00:47:33,842 --> 00:47:35,381
We go to Sokcho A.

1299
00:47:35,382 --> 00:47:37,811
And it's better to do more than just blocking them.

1300
00:47:37,812 --> 00:47:39,282
It's better if Gangneung A is open.

1301
00:47:39,652 --> 00:47:41,052
What's great...

1302
00:47:41,182 --> 00:47:44,621
is that we have two options that are the same.

1303
00:47:44,622 --> 00:47:45,792
- Isn't that crazy?
- Yes.

1304
00:47:46,352 --> 00:47:48,391
The best part is that our stealth mode is on.

1305
00:47:48,392 --> 00:47:51,262
- I love that.
- Right. Our cuckoo is... Yes.

1306
00:47:51,332 --> 00:47:53,192
Everything is going according to our plan.

1307
00:47:54,002 --> 00:47:55,101
I love it.

1308
00:47:55,102 --> 00:47:56,662
I'll rip off Sokcho, then.

1309
00:47:57,032 --> 00:47:58,372
Yes. You take care of Sokcho.

1310
00:47:58,402 --> 00:47:59,931
I'll take care of Gangneung.

1311
00:47:59,932 --> 00:48:01,071
That'll be the last spot,

1312
00:48:01,072 --> 00:48:02,172
- so dominate it.
- Okay.

1313
00:48:03,002 --> 00:48:04,111
- Yi Kyung.
- Yes?

1314
00:48:04,112 --> 00:48:06,912
- We might get a bingo today.
- We have a chance.

1315
00:48:06,942 --> 00:48:08,511
When we eat, put them to sleep,

1316
00:48:08,512 --> 00:48:10,192
and go to Gangneung, we might get a bingo.

1317
00:48:11,182 --> 00:48:12,881
Won't it end too quickly, then?

1318
00:48:12,882 --> 00:48:14,621
We have to get questions right, though.

1319
00:48:14,622 --> 00:48:16,021
I'll have to leave faster, then.

1320
00:48:16,022 --> 00:48:17,091
(That's sad.)

1321
00:48:17,092 --> 00:48:18,221
You can stay longer.

1322
00:48:18,222 --> 00:48:19,392
Are you on a trip?

1323
00:48:19,592 --> 00:48:20,962
I really feel...

1324
00:48:21,822 --> 00:48:23,592
like I'm on a picnic, and I love it.

1325
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:26,138
If we lose, are you going to get the penalty, then?

1326
00:48:26,162 --> 00:48:27,301
(Thinking)

1327
00:48:27,302 --> 00:48:28,561
Right. For the penalty,

1328
00:48:28,562 --> 00:48:29,831
we have to play another game.

1329
00:48:29,832 --> 00:48:31,671
(We have to play another game to decide that.)

1330
00:48:31,672 --> 00:48:32,871
We have to.

1331
00:48:32,872 --> 00:48:34,941
(Friendship doesn't mean taking the penalty for others.)

1332
00:48:34,942 --> 00:48:36,172
Gosh. It's the sea.

1333
00:48:36,702 --> 00:48:37,842
I see the sea.

1334
00:48:38,342 --> 00:48:40,342
We're in Sokcho.

1335
00:48:40,982 --> 00:48:42,082
Yes.

1336
00:48:42,812 --> 00:48:44,351
I'm glad it's not outdoors.

1337
00:48:44,352 --> 00:48:45,981
- It's not outdoors.
- Exactly.

1338
00:48:45,982 --> 00:48:47,782
- We have to stay indoors.
- It's still cold.

1339
00:48:47,852 --> 00:48:49,881
Okay. Show us first.

1340
00:48:49,882 --> 00:48:51,168
Do you want to see the video of it?

1341
00:48:51,192 --> 00:48:53,122
What? How do we do it?

1342
00:48:54,522 --> 00:48:56,221
We have to get in it first.

1343
00:48:56,222 --> 00:48:57,261
(Step 1: Enter)

1344
00:48:57,262 --> 00:48:59,531
(Clear the mission to a song.)

1345
00:48:59,532 --> 00:49:00,601
(Step 2: Turn around)

1346
00:49:00,602 --> 00:49:01,862
- We turn around.
- Around.

1347
00:49:02,032 --> 00:49:03,672
We touch the ground.

1348
00:49:04,172 --> 00:49:06,502
(Step 4: Cheer)

1349
00:49:06,632 --> 00:49:08,001
(Step 5: Exit)

1350
00:49:08,002 --> 00:49:09,441
When they say goodbye, we exit.

1351
00:49:09,442 --> 00:49:11,071
Do we have to exit it to finish?

1352
00:49:11,072 --> 00:49:12,312
- Yes.
- Yes.

1353
00:49:12,472 --> 00:49:13,811
Well, actually.

1354
00:49:13,812 --> 00:49:15,512
We have two athletes...

1355
00:49:15,542 --> 00:49:17,451
and a professional variety show star.

1356
00:49:17,452 --> 00:49:18,611
It'll be easy.

1357
00:49:18,612 --> 00:49:20,012
I've done it many times.

1358
00:49:20,552 --> 00:49:21,751
- Go.
- Okay.

1359
00:49:21,752 --> 00:49:22,952
(Practicing)

1360
00:49:25,692 --> 00:49:28,892
(Sung Hoon jumps lightly.)

1361
00:49:30,362 --> 00:49:31,692
We can touch the ground.

1362
00:49:32,062 --> 00:49:33,308
- Touch the ground.
- Touch the ground.

1363
00:49:33,332 --> 00:49:34,761
We have to turn around too.

1364
00:49:34,762 --> 00:49:35,762
Turn around.

1365
00:49:35,763 --> 00:49:37,301
It's hard to turn around.

1366
00:49:37,302 --> 00:49:38,501
(Jumping lightly)

1367
00:49:38,502 --> 00:49:39,771
Gosh. Seriously.

1368
00:49:39,772 --> 00:49:41,492
(Sung Hoon turns around and jumps at once.)

1369
00:49:41,772 --> 00:49:42,801
(But he catches up in the rope right away.)

1370
00:49:42,802 --> 00:49:44,572
- Sung Hoon.
- This is hard.

1371
00:49:45,142 --> 00:49:47,042
Why is it so hard?

1372
00:49:47,142 --> 00:49:50,382
The timing of touching the ground feels a bit weird.

1373
00:49:50,482 --> 00:49:52,611
- It feels like a double-tap.
- Double tapping.

1374
00:49:52,612 --> 00:49:54,452
(Are you a lefty?)

1375
00:49:54,522 --> 00:49:55,821
Are you a lefty?

1376
00:49:55,822 --> 00:49:56,992
- Yes.
- I see.

1377
00:49:57,422 --> 00:49:58,751
(The rope is fine.)

1378
00:49:58,752 --> 00:49:59,952
What?

1379
00:50:00,262 --> 00:50:01,592
"Are you a lefty?"

1380
00:50:02,392 --> 00:50:04,891
- I'll go in first. Then Sang Uk.
- Okay.

1381
00:50:04,892 --> 00:50:07,202
Once Sung Hoon is in, we'll do the mission.

1382
00:50:07,332 --> 00:50:08,601
I'll go in boldly.

1383
00:50:08,602 --> 00:50:10,478
(How many times will the professional entertainers need?)

1384
00:50:10,502 --> 00:50:13,202
(Their 1st try)

1385
00:50:13,772 --> 00:50:14,872
Gosh.

1386
00:50:16,002 --> 00:50:18,571
- Kids - Gosh.

1387
00:50:18,572 --> 00:50:20,911
- Turn around - Turn around.

1388
00:50:20,912 --> 00:50:23,181
After turning around

1389
00:50:23,182 --> 00:50:25,252
- Touch the ground - Touch the ground.

1390
00:50:25,352 --> 00:50:27,621
After touching the ground

1391
00:50:27,622 --> 00:50:29,681
- Cheer - Hurray.

1392
00:50:29,682 --> 00:50:31,652
(Mission's step 4: Cheer)

1393
00:50:31,752 --> 00:50:33,392
(Will they succeed on their first try?)

1394
00:50:35,262 --> 00:50:37,731
(Sang Uk's long legs catch the rope.)

1395
00:50:37,732 --> 00:50:39,252
- Gosh.
- We were almost there, right?

1396
00:50:39,792 --> 00:50:41,932
I think we can do it.

1397
00:50:42,132 --> 00:50:43,601
- It was Sang Uk who failed.
- Yes.

1398
00:50:43,602 --> 00:50:45,001
Really? Hey!

1399
00:50:45,002 --> 00:50:46,672
While trying to say what the mission was,

1400
00:50:46,772 --> 00:50:48,141
I missed the tempo.

1401
00:50:48,142 --> 00:50:49,572
You're an athlete.

1402
00:50:49,602 --> 00:50:51,442
- Gosh. This is so...
- Wait.

1403
00:50:51,542 --> 00:50:53,912
It's only been ten minutes since we ate.

1404
00:50:54,512 --> 00:50:57,512
Come on. We had beef tartare.

1405
00:50:57,552 --> 00:51:00,011
- We're jumping with the buckwheat.
- Exactly.

1406
00:51:00,012 --> 00:51:01,722
(They're jumping with the buckwheat.)

1407
00:51:01,752 --> 00:51:03,451
My body feels heavy, indeed.

1408
00:51:03,452 --> 00:51:05,168
(It's filled with beef tartare and buckwheat.)

1409
00:51:05,192 --> 00:51:06,521
It's hard to touch the ground.

1410
00:51:06,522 --> 00:51:08,661
Actually, instead of you going in first,

1411
00:51:08,662 --> 00:51:10,331
- it'll be better if I go in first.
- That's right.

1412
00:51:10,332 --> 00:51:11,931
- Okay.
- It's hard for you...

1413
00:51:11,932 --> 00:51:13,652
- because you have to keep jumping.
- Okay.

1414
00:51:14,232 --> 00:51:15,701
He's a true sportsman, indeed.

1415
00:51:15,702 --> 00:51:17,672
Catch your breath. Let me know when you're ready.

1416
00:51:18,732 --> 00:51:19,871
Okay.

1417
00:51:19,872 --> 00:51:20,902
(Approaching)

1418
00:51:21,302 --> 00:51:23,302
(Putting pressure without a word)

1419
00:51:23,372 --> 00:51:24,771
(His body cam shakes tremendously.)

1420
00:51:24,772 --> 00:51:26,111
Why? What do you...

1421
00:51:26,112 --> 00:51:27,741
Let's do this right.

1422
00:51:27,742 --> 00:51:29,282
(Joking)

1423
00:51:29,842 --> 00:51:32,081
(He disciplines the rope turner.)

1424
00:51:32,082 --> 00:51:34,202
He might keep turning the rope even if we get caught.

1425
00:51:34,252 --> 00:51:36,652
- Okay. Let's do it.
- Shall we?

1426
00:51:37,322 --> 00:51:39,352
- This way.
- He gets in right away.

1427
00:51:41,192 --> 00:51:42,721
(Step 1: Enter, Cleared)

1428
00:51:42,722 --> 00:51:45,031
- Kids - Sang Uk, move forward.

1429
00:51:45,032 --> 00:51:46,232
Turn...

1430
00:51:46,262 --> 00:51:47,602
- Hold on.
- Sorry.

1431
00:51:48,032 --> 00:51:49,961
(Sang Uk entangled in the rope while moving and turning around.)

1432
00:51:49,962 --> 00:51:51,072
Sorry.

1433
00:51:51,902 --> 00:51:53,702
- Hey.
- Did I have to go forward?

1434
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,541
Hey. Is it you again?

1435
00:51:55,542 --> 00:51:56,941
Well...

1436
00:51:56,942 --> 00:51:58,371
You needed to move forward a little for me.

1437
00:51:58,372 --> 00:51:59,712
(A terrible sinner)

1438
00:51:59,842 --> 00:52:01,512
I couldn't focus.

1439
00:52:01,682 --> 00:52:04,112
What? You couldn't focus?

1440
00:52:05,082 --> 00:52:07,881
- Okay. I need to jump right there.
- Hold on.

1441
00:52:07,882 --> 00:52:09,622
Isn't it because of your shoes?

1442
00:52:09,922 --> 00:52:11,651
- No.
- Take them off, then.

1443
00:52:11,652 --> 00:52:12,722
I'm good right now.

1444
00:52:13,992 --> 00:52:15,392
Take them off already.

1445
00:52:15,492 --> 00:52:16,892
I'm really okay.

1446
00:52:16,922 --> 00:52:17,991
You're really okay?

1447
00:52:17,992 --> 00:52:19,161
Really. Don't worry about it.

1448
00:52:19,162 --> 00:52:20,191
This will be my last time wearing them.

1449
00:52:20,192 --> 00:52:21,761
- The last time? Okay.
- Okay.

1450
00:52:21,762 --> 00:52:23,031
(He got a promise that it'd be the last time.)

1451
00:52:23,032 --> 00:52:24,701
(Team Guys goes for the mission again.)

1452
00:52:24,702 --> 00:52:26,002
Yes. We'll go in.

1453
00:52:26,232 --> 00:52:28,272
(Their 3rd try)

1454
00:52:30,412 --> 00:52:32,511
(The masters of entering)

1455
00:52:32,512 --> 00:52:33,911
- Good.
- Kids

1456
00:52:33,912 --> 00:52:37,011
Kids, turn around

1457
00:52:37,012 --> 00:52:38,782
(This is easy for them now.)

1458
00:52:39,582 --> 00:52:40,681
(Next is the Step 3, touching the ground.)

1459
00:52:40,682 --> 00:52:42,682
(Touching)

1460
00:52:43,582 --> 00:52:47,722
(Tae Hyun touched the ground a bit late.)

1461
00:52:48,962 --> 00:52:51,261
(The cheering part they failed on their first try)

1462
00:52:51,262 --> 00:52:53,432
(Passing it without a problem)

1463
00:52:53,632 --> 00:52:55,802
(They'll succeed if they exit at the right time.)

1464
00:52:56,832 --> 00:52:58,972
(He exited too early.)

1465
00:52:59,102 --> 00:53:01,871
- After cheering, goodbye - Go out.

1466
00:53:01,872 --> 00:53:03,241
(Sung Hoon thought they had to exit.)

1467
00:53:03,242 --> 00:53:04,842
(He found others still jumping.)

1468
00:53:05,112 --> 00:53:08,242
(Responding at an incredible speed, he went back in.)

1469
00:53:08,912 --> 00:53:11,352
(In the meantime, the others exited on time.)

1470
00:53:11,482 --> 00:53:13,958
(Now, only Sung Hoon needs to exit without getting tangled up.)

1471
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:16,081
(Did he get tangled in the rope?)

1472
00:53:16,082 --> 00:53:17,221
Isn't it a success?

1473
00:53:17,222 --> 00:53:18,292
(Was it a success?)

1474
00:53:18,622 --> 00:53:19,991
Goodbye

1475
00:53:19,992 --> 00:53:21,762
(Tae Hyun and Sang Uk exited.)

1476
00:53:21,892 --> 00:53:23,722
(Rolling)

1477
00:53:24,132 --> 00:53:25,632
(A different angle of it)

1478
00:53:26,392 --> 00:53:28,401
(He had a grand exit without getting tangled.)

1479
00:53:28,402 --> 00:53:29,502
Isn't it a success?

1480
00:53:30,402 --> 00:53:32,301
(He's a Mr. Sportsman, indeed.)

1481
00:53:32,302 --> 00:53:33,901
He exited in such a cool way.

1482
00:53:33,902 --> 00:53:35,801
- How did you exit?
- I don't know.

1483
00:53:35,802 --> 00:53:37,212
I exited and went in again.

1484
00:53:38,312 --> 00:53:39,512
In any case,

1485
00:53:39,672 --> 00:53:42,542
if the rope never stopped turning, it's a success.

1486
00:53:43,442 --> 00:53:44,711
Why is this exhausting?

1487
00:53:44,712 --> 00:53:46,082
(Why is this exhausting?)

1488
00:53:46,612 --> 00:53:48,621
You cleared the mission. That was really fast.

1489
00:53:48,622 --> 00:53:49,782
- I knew it.
- Let's go.

1490
00:53:50,222 --> 00:53:51,521
(What's their next destination?)

1491
00:53:51,522 --> 00:53:52,752
Gangneung is this way.

1492
00:53:53,422 --> 00:53:54,491
Jjamppong.

1493
00:53:54,492 --> 00:53:55,961
If the other team went this way,

1494
00:53:55,962 --> 00:53:57,761
we can occupy all these spots.

1495
00:53:57,762 --> 00:53:59,231
What's their famous food?

1496
00:53:59,232 --> 00:54:00,872
- Potato dough soup.
- Potato dough soup.

1497
00:54:00,962 --> 00:54:02,201
Potato dough soup?

1498
00:54:02,202 --> 00:54:03,761
You might not know what it is.

1499
00:54:03,762 --> 00:54:05,371
It's the one we have with the broth, right?

1500
00:54:05,372 --> 00:54:06,601
- I see.
- Like tteokguk.

1501
00:54:06,602 --> 00:54:07,972
Like tteokguk.

1502
00:54:08,502 --> 00:54:10,302
- Or sujebi?
- I don't feel like it.

1503
00:54:11,842 --> 00:54:13,842
Sorry. I don't feel like eating it.

1504
00:54:14,382 --> 00:54:16,041
- Let's go to Gangneung, then.
- Jjamppong?

1505
00:54:16,042 --> 00:54:18,512
- We'll go to have jjamppong.
- It's a menu board for us.

1506
00:54:19,382 --> 00:54:20,822
Yes. Jjamppong it is.

1507
00:54:21,282 --> 00:54:23,081
Let's go. After all,

1508
00:54:23,082 --> 00:54:25,121
it's not for the bingo but for a menu.

1509
00:54:25,122 --> 00:54:26,651
(It's Sung Hoon's food-tasting trip again.)

1510
00:54:26,652 --> 00:54:27,722
Jjamppong.

1511
00:54:29,992 --> 00:54:32,392
Their alarm hasn't gone off until now.

1512
00:54:32,732 --> 00:54:34,232
That doesn't make sense.

1513
00:54:35,002 --> 00:54:38,572
I thought they'd head to Gangneung.

1514
00:54:38,832 --> 00:54:40,672
Since our alarm went off,

1515
00:54:40,742 --> 00:54:43,502
- they'll go to Sokcho A.
- Yes.

1516
00:54:43,942 --> 00:54:45,218
Should we use the tracking card?

1517
00:54:45,242 --> 00:54:47,711
If we use it and they're in Gangneung,

1518
00:54:47,712 --> 00:54:50,382
it is better for us to go straight to Sokcho?

1519
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:51,581
I think that's better.

1520
00:54:51,582 --> 00:54:52,752
Okay. In that case...

1521
00:54:53,212 --> 00:54:56,722
We'll use the tracking card right now.

1522
00:54:58,892 --> 00:55:00,391
They're in Sokcho.

1523
00:55:00,392 --> 00:55:01,521
They are here.

1524
00:55:01,522 --> 00:55:03,361
(Team Handsome, Sokcho City Hall, Sokcho Intercity Bus Terminal)

1525
00:55:03,362 --> 00:55:04,592
Sokcho?

1526
00:55:04,862 --> 00:55:06,561
They went up north.

1527
00:55:06,562 --> 00:55:07,631
Yes. Exactly.

1528
00:55:07,632 --> 00:55:09,262
So, we should go to Gangneung.

1529
00:55:09,302 --> 00:55:11,231
- We'll go to Gangneung B, then.
- Yes.

1530
00:55:11,232 --> 00:55:12,431
(They head to Gangneung B.)

1531
00:55:12,432 --> 00:55:14,442
It'll take 50 minutes. Not bad.

1532
00:55:14,772 --> 00:55:17,342
Why isn't their alarm going off for so long?

1533
00:55:17,842 --> 00:55:19,042
It doesn't make sense.

1534
00:55:19,072 --> 00:55:21,241
Did they not use the reattempt card?

1535
00:55:21,242 --> 00:55:22,682
Is that even possible?

1536
00:55:22,882 --> 00:55:25,251
They said if they got it right, the cuckoo alarm would go off.

1537
00:55:25,252 --> 00:55:26,352
Exactly.

1538
00:55:26,752 --> 00:55:28,651
Did they use a wish card to mute the alarm?

1539
00:55:28,652 --> 00:55:29,852
There's no such thing. Wait.

1540
00:55:30,622 --> 00:55:31,651
That might be it.

1541
00:55:31,652 --> 00:55:33,268
- They have the wish card.
- And that was their wish.

1542
00:55:33,292 --> 00:55:36,222
Do we have to move around without putting their marks?

1543
00:55:36,362 --> 00:55:39,532
- That's possible.
- That's possible.

1544
00:55:39,662 --> 00:55:41,462
It's a strong move.

1545
00:55:41,532 --> 00:55:44,102
(Thinking hard)

1546
00:55:44,302 --> 00:55:46,271
Hey. If that's the case,

1547
00:55:46,272 --> 00:55:48,341
let's say that I have the wish card.

1548
00:55:48,342 --> 00:55:50,741
I won't use it to mute the alarm.

1549
00:55:50,742 --> 00:55:52,571
- Me neither.
- It's because...

1550
00:55:52,572 --> 00:55:55,141
it can be used as a reattempt card.

1551
00:55:55,142 --> 00:55:57,712
It can be used to bounce back the exercise transfer card.

1552
00:55:57,752 --> 00:55:59,711
While there are two great options,

1553
00:55:59,712 --> 00:56:02,081
will they use it to mute the cuckoo?

1554
00:56:02,082 --> 00:56:03,651
- Is that so?
- That's so...

1555
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:05,051
- Right. That's so...
- That's...

1556
00:56:05,052 --> 00:56:07,192
It'd be such a shame to use it that way.

1557
00:56:07,492 --> 00:56:09,891
- Did they get them wrong?
- They got the questions wrong.

1558
00:56:09,892 --> 00:56:10,991
- Did they get them all wrong?
- Yes.

1559
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:12,761
- We should say they failed.
- For me,

1560
00:56:12,762 --> 00:56:14,402
that doesn't make sense.

1561
00:56:14,532 --> 00:56:15,901
The places are far away.

1562
00:56:15,902 --> 00:56:18,102
If they went up north after getting the question wrong,

1563
00:56:18,202 --> 00:56:20,001
they might be still on the way.

1564
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:21,472
- That's possible.
- Is that so?

1565
00:56:22,902 --> 00:56:25,241
- We're going off to Gangneung now.
- Yes. We're going off.

1566
00:56:25,242 --> 00:56:27,072
Let's exit the highway.

1567
00:56:27,112 --> 00:56:29,682
I really don't think they used the wish to mute the alarm.

1568
00:56:30,182 --> 00:56:31,881
(Team Handsome)

1569
00:56:31,882 --> 00:56:33,751
- It's nice.
- What a beautiful day.

1570
00:56:33,752 --> 00:56:36,181
Is Sokcho famous for naengmyeon?

1571
00:56:36,182 --> 00:56:37,582
It's a Long-lasting Small Business.

1572
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,892
It says naengmyeon with raw pollack...

1573
00:56:40,662 --> 00:56:42,261
was first made in this restaurant!

1574
00:56:42,262 --> 00:56:43,502
(Sokcho A: Hamheung naengmyeon)

1575
00:56:43,762 --> 00:56:45,392
I'm going to get bibim naengmyeon.

1576
00:56:45,892 --> 00:56:47,931
- Hello.
- Welcome.

1577
00:56:47,932 --> 00:56:49,401
Hello.

1578
00:56:49,402 --> 00:56:51,102
- Hello. Yes.
- Welcome.

1579
00:56:52,002 --> 00:56:53,501
By the way, is naengmyeon with raw pollack...

1580
00:56:53,502 --> 00:56:55,801
- your signature menu?
- Yes.

1581
00:56:55,802 --> 00:56:56,941
- Is that...
- It's Hamheung naengmyeon.

1582
00:56:56,942 --> 00:56:58,272
Is that Hamheung naengmyeon?

1583
00:56:58,472 --> 00:56:59,972
I'll get Hamheung naengmyeon.

1584
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:02,282
That's the signature menu. I'll get mul naengmyeon.

1585
00:57:02,542 --> 00:57:05,051
We'll get 2 Hamheung naengmyeon, 1 mul naengmyeon,

1586
00:57:05,052 --> 00:57:07,312
and one pork suyuk.

1587
00:57:07,382 --> 00:57:08,852
Are we having suyuk?

1588
00:57:09,022 --> 00:57:10,322
We can have it quickly.

1589
00:57:10,852 --> 00:57:12,791
It'll be gone in no time.

1590
00:57:12,792 --> 00:57:14,938
- You're so annoying.
- There will be only a few pieces.

1591
00:57:14,962 --> 00:57:15,992
Really?

1592
00:57:17,432 --> 00:57:19,561
I saw it outside that it's a Long-lasting Small Business.

1593
00:57:19,562 --> 00:57:20,591
- Hey. Look at the photo.
- What?

1594
00:57:20,592 --> 00:57:21,832
Isn't that Hwang Young Cho?

1595
00:57:23,432 --> 00:57:24,432
That's right.

1596
00:57:24,802 --> 00:57:25,832
I see.

1597
00:57:27,202 --> 00:57:31,042
(When you look at the frames on the wall carefully, )

1598
00:57:33,272 --> 00:57:36,712
(you can find some old photos.)

1599
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:40,052
(One of them grabs their attention.)

1600
00:57:40,382 --> 00:57:43,552
He is the founder of this restaurant.

1601
00:57:44,322 --> 00:57:45,822
His motto is "A smile..."

1602
00:57:45,952 --> 00:57:47,461
- "is the source of efficiency." - "The source of efficiency."

1603
00:57:47,462 --> 00:57:49,262
(The 1st founder: Late Lee Seop Bong)

1604
00:57:49,522 --> 00:57:50,961
When are you going to stop frowning?

1605
00:57:50,962 --> 00:57:52,832
(Suddenly?)

1606
00:57:53,132 --> 00:57:54,831
My father taught me to do so.

1607
00:57:54,832 --> 00:57:56,902
Your father is an amazing person,

1608
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,372
but we're talking about the motto.

1609
00:57:59,602 --> 00:58:00,602
Thank you.

1610
00:58:00,603 --> 00:58:02,571
- It's cold water.
- Okay. Thanks.

1611
00:58:02,572 --> 00:58:04,052
How long has this place been running?

1612
00:58:04,542 --> 00:58:06,911
It opened in 1968.

1613
00:58:06,912 --> 00:58:09,081
- In 1968?
- Yes. It opened then.

1614
00:58:09,082 --> 00:58:10,781
- Is that your father?
- He's my grandfather.

1615
00:58:10,782 --> 00:58:12,611
From your grandfather and father to you.

1616
00:58:12,612 --> 00:58:13,652
That's right.

1617
00:58:14,152 --> 00:58:15,472
It's a three-generation business.

1618
00:58:16,522 --> 00:58:19,191
(He's excited.)

1619
00:58:19,192 --> 00:58:21,521
(Looking around)

1620
00:58:21,522 --> 00:58:23,261
(Pork suyuk came out first.)

1621
00:58:23,262 --> 00:58:24,962
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1622
00:58:25,562 --> 00:58:26,632
- By the way...
- Gosh.

1623
00:58:29,762 --> 00:58:31,372
There are many people like that.

1624
00:58:31,832 --> 00:58:33,778
Si Yang, if you grab two pieces, we'll get into a fight.

1625
00:58:33,802 --> 00:58:37,042
Who eats one piece of meat at a time?

1626
00:58:37,242 --> 00:58:39,342
(Laughing)

1627
00:58:39,672 --> 00:58:43,482
(Si Yang focuses on the food again.)

1628
00:58:44,082 --> 00:58:46,651
(Putting seasoned raw pollack on a piece of suyuk)

1629
00:58:46,652 --> 00:58:47,922
(Savoring)

1630
00:58:49,422 --> 00:58:53,252
(Seung Ho and Yi Kyung take a bite too.)

1631
00:58:53,722 --> 00:58:54,962
Gosh. The pollack is tasty.

1632
00:58:55,622 --> 00:58:57,662
- It's savory.
- Yes. It's good. Gosh.

1633
00:58:58,662 --> 00:59:01,302
I can feel the grain on my tongue because it's so soft.

1634
00:59:02,762 --> 00:59:04,502
It's not hard. It's soft.

1635
00:59:05,732 --> 00:59:06,832
Its texture is...

1636
00:59:07,842 --> 00:59:10,101
Should I say it's fluffy?

1637
00:59:10,102 --> 00:59:12,141
(Should I say it's fluffy?)

1638
00:59:12,142 --> 00:59:13,342
It's so good.

1639
00:59:15,582 --> 00:59:18,312
(After cutting the pollack into bite-sized pieces, )

1640
00:59:19,882 --> 00:59:23,622
(they mix it with a special sauce.)

1641
00:59:24,822 --> 00:59:26,221
(The proud family recipe)

1642
00:59:26,222 --> 00:59:28,262
(The mouth-watering seasoned raw pollack is ready.)

1643
00:59:28,892 --> 00:59:30,298
- Are they ready already?
- They're here.

1644
00:59:30,322 --> 00:59:31,431
They're fast.

1645
00:59:31,432 --> 00:59:32,531
(Naengmyeon, the main dish, is here.)

1646
00:59:32,532 --> 00:59:33,592
The noodles are...

1647
00:59:33,862 --> 00:59:34,962
Thank you.

1648
00:59:40,302 --> 00:59:43,172
(Mul naengmyeon Yi Kyung ordered)

1649
00:59:44,342 --> 00:59:46,812
(Si Yang and Seung Ho's Hamheung naengmyeon)

1650
00:59:47,742 --> 00:59:50,912
(The raw pollack is on naengmyeon.)

1651
00:59:53,082 --> 00:59:54,622
- They told us to put this in.
- Yes.

1652
00:59:55,322 --> 00:59:56,522
How much?

1653
00:59:56,722 --> 00:59:57,892
Just a little?

1654
00:59:59,122 --> 01:00:00,492
- A little.
- A little.

1655
01:00:01,162 --> 01:00:02,191
The color changes.

1656
01:00:02,192 --> 01:00:03,832
(Adding a little bit of naengmyeon broth)

1657
01:00:04,492 --> 01:00:06,431
(Vinegar)

1658
01:00:06,432 --> 01:00:08,061
- So?
- Why is this so good?

1659
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,062
(Mustard)

1660
01:00:09,432 --> 01:00:11,031
You're right. It's dongchimi.

1661
01:00:11,032 --> 01:00:12,101
(Mixing well)

1662
01:00:12,102 --> 01:00:13,431
It's dongchimi,

1663
01:00:13,432 --> 01:00:14,602
but it has soy sauce in it.

1664
01:00:16,672 --> 01:00:18,672
(Shall we try it?)

1665
01:00:21,712 --> 01:00:22,982
All I can see is pollack.

1666
01:00:23,382 --> 01:00:24,882
These pollacks are different.

1667
01:00:25,912 --> 01:00:27,352
This one is softer.

1668
01:00:28,052 --> 01:00:29,952
Gosh. How should I say it?

1669
01:00:30,652 --> 01:00:31,922
It's very flavorful.

1670
01:00:32,352 --> 01:00:33,551
And it's so tender.

1671
01:00:33,552 --> 01:00:35,762
(It's very flavorful. And it's so tender.)

1672
01:00:35,992 --> 01:00:37,661
It's very unique and tasty.

1673
01:00:37,662 --> 01:00:40,462
(Taking another bite)

1674
01:00:40,732 --> 01:00:42,032
The broth of naengmyeon is...

1675
01:00:42,162 --> 01:00:44,001
very unique, as if it had soy sauce in it.

1676
01:00:44,002 --> 01:00:45,501
(The color of the broth is different from an ordinary one.)

1677
01:00:45,502 --> 01:00:46,902
What is the broth made of?

1678
01:00:47,202 --> 01:00:50,071
The base of it is dongchimi.

1679
01:00:50,072 --> 01:00:51,572
That's the secret.

1680
01:00:53,112 --> 01:00:54,342
It's all right.

1681
01:00:54,782 --> 01:00:55,942
The sesame oil...

1682
01:00:56,582 --> 01:00:58,352
They used sesame oil and something else.

1683
01:01:01,882 --> 01:01:03,722
This naengmyeon must be so popular in summer.

1684
01:01:04,292 --> 01:01:06,091
Since they use dongchimi as the base,

1685
01:01:06,092 --> 01:01:08,622
it's super refreshing.

1686
01:01:10,422 --> 01:01:11,462
By the way...

1687
01:01:12,032 --> 01:01:15,602
(Seung Ho is eating without a word.)

1688
01:01:17,032 --> 01:01:18,831
This is very tasty.

1689
01:01:18,832 --> 01:01:20,572
It's hard to tell but...

1690
01:01:20,902 --> 01:01:24,172
(A solitary big eater)

1691
01:01:25,272 --> 01:01:27,632
If I'm wrong, I can't do anything about it. It's just good.

1692
01:01:28,112 --> 01:01:29,181
It must be popular.

1693
01:01:29,182 --> 01:01:31,452
(In the zone)

1694
01:01:34,522 --> 01:01:35,822
Have you been starving for days?

1695
01:01:36,182 --> 01:01:38,222
(Nodding)

1696
01:01:39,152 --> 01:01:40,592
You haven't been eating Korean food?

1697
01:01:41,022 --> 01:01:42,061
No.

1698
01:01:42,062 --> 01:01:43,591
(Seung Ho haven't had Korean food since he went shooting overseas.)

1699
01:01:43,592 --> 01:01:47,232
I just love this taste of red food.

1700
01:01:50,432 --> 01:01:53,332
(The 2-person devouring harmony)

1701
01:01:54,102 --> 01:01:56,442
Please tell me. How does it taste?

1702
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:58,742
As you know,

1703
01:01:58,842 --> 01:02:00,342
I speak by how I eat.

1704
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:02,042
By the act of eating.

1705
01:02:03,082 --> 01:02:05,352
(Take a good look.)

1706
01:02:07,282 --> 01:02:09,882
(This is what it tastes like.)

1707
01:02:10,782 --> 01:02:14,091
I don't think there's a person who visits this place only once.

1708
01:02:14,092 --> 01:02:15,852
- You're right.
- They must come here often.

1709
01:02:17,832 --> 01:02:19,192
The food is really good here.

1710
01:02:21,102 --> 01:02:24,202
The Long-lasting Small Business of naengmyeon in Sokcho.

1711
01:02:24,802 --> 01:02:26,271
We enjoyed Hamheung naengmyeon.

1712
01:02:26,272 --> 01:02:27,372
It was really good.

1713
01:02:27,772 --> 01:02:28,772
Did you enjoy it?

1714
01:02:28,772 --> 01:02:29,772
- Very much.
- Of course.

1715
01:02:29,773 --> 01:02:31,341
We finished it while we already ate before.

1716
01:02:31,342 --> 01:02:33,018
Ma'am, we actually had a meal before we came here.

1717
01:02:33,042 --> 01:02:34,511
- Really?
- But we ate like this again.

1718
01:02:34,512 --> 01:02:35,641
In fact, if we had time,

1719
01:02:35,642 --> 01:02:37,811
I'd surely devoured beef suyuk too.

1720
01:02:37,812 --> 01:02:39,012
Our dumplings are tasty too.

1721
01:02:39,212 --> 01:02:40,781
- Do you have dumplings?
- No.

1722
01:02:40,782 --> 01:02:42,552
Stop saying such a thing.

1723
01:02:42,822 --> 01:02:45,142
- Where are the dumplings?
- We already finished our meal.

1724
01:02:45,222 --> 01:02:46,822
Okay. We'll solve the quiz now.

1725
01:02:48,622 --> 01:02:50,191
On our Gangwon Province Special,

1726
01:02:50,192 --> 01:02:52,591
we'll solve the question for Sokcho.

1727
01:02:52,592 --> 01:02:53,892
- Okay.
- I'm stressed.

1728
01:02:54,932 --> 01:02:57,101
In addition to Hamheung naengmyeon,

1729
01:02:57,102 --> 01:02:59,202
Pyongyang naengmyeon is popular too.

1730
01:02:59,372 --> 01:03:00,731
In Pyongyang in the past,

1731
01:03:00,732 --> 01:03:02,872
naengmyeon restaurants flourished,

1732
01:03:03,272 --> 01:03:05,542
so the labor was divided.

1733
01:03:06,672 --> 01:03:09,282
The one who is in charge of the dough was a dough-maker.

1734
01:03:09,782 --> 01:03:11,451
The one who puts the garnish...

1735
01:03:11,452 --> 01:03:13,452
was called garnish-placer.

1736
01:03:13,782 --> 01:03:18,692
Then, what did a front-grabber do?

1737
01:03:18,992 --> 01:03:20,552
They were a tout.

1738
01:03:21,592 --> 01:03:23,892
It's because he said the business flourished.

1739
01:03:24,462 --> 01:03:25,562
The front-grabber.

1740
01:03:25,732 --> 01:03:27,732
They might be the ones who made the broth.

1741
01:03:28,532 --> 01:03:30,661
We go to a naengmyeon place.

1742
01:03:30,662 --> 01:03:32,572
Let's see how the labor was divided.

1743
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:35,071
- There is a kneading person.
- Yes.

1744
01:03:35,072 --> 01:03:36,402
The noodles are done.

1745
01:03:36,702 --> 01:03:38,811
Lastly, there are people who make and put the garnish on.

1746
01:03:38,812 --> 01:03:40,612
- That's the last step.
- The garnish-placer.

1747
01:03:40,812 --> 01:03:43,441
Before that, there is a person who makes the broth.

1748
01:03:43,442 --> 01:03:44,552
- Yes.
- Or...

1749
01:03:44,752 --> 01:03:46,581
It was hard to make the broth back then...

1750
01:03:46,582 --> 01:03:48,152
since it used beef.

1751
01:03:48,382 --> 01:03:50,421
Should we mention the butcher who butchers the cows?

1752
01:03:50,422 --> 01:03:52,251
- Or who grabs the ingredients.
- Right.

1753
01:03:52,252 --> 01:03:54,291
- Who receives the ingredients.
- That's plausible.

1754
01:03:54,292 --> 01:03:55,392
Yes. Or...

1755
01:03:55,922 --> 01:03:57,932
We have to connect it to the front-grabber.

1756
01:03:59,032 --> 01:04:00,232
You said you'd do this.

1757
01:04:00,692 --> 01:04:01,932
Show us what you got, Seung Ho.

1758
01:04:02,802 --> 01:04:04,902
I might have to do it in Gangneung.

1759
01:04:06,332 --> 01:04:09,072
Come to think of it, I got myself confused.

1760
01:04:09,472 --> 01:04:11,672
Si Yang was in charge of Sokcho, but I got it confused.

1761
01:04:11,942 --> 01:04:13,641
But I'll do my best.

1762
01:04:13,642 --> 01:04:15,042
A front-grabber.

1763
01:04:15,112 --> 01:04:18,011
I thought it was a person who actually grabbed something.

1764
01:04:18,012 --> 01:04:19,581
- For example, - Grab a cow?

1765
01:04:19,582 --> 01:04:21,522
After making the dough...

1766
01:04:21,652 --> 01:04:23,381
The one who grabs and pulls the noodles?

1767
01:04:23,382 --> 01:04:26,352
The one who grabs the front part of the noodles.

1768
01:04:26,792 --> 01:04:28,861
- They grab the noodles and...
- It's because the dough...

1769
01:04:28,862 --> 01:04:31,231
When we go to a Chinese restaurant,

1770
01:04:31,232 --> 01:04:33,191
there's one who makes the noodles all day long.

1771
01:04:33,192 --> 01:04:36,132
I don't think a noodle-making person can do another task.

1772
01:04:36,202 --> 01:04:37,902
That was very persuasive.

1773
01:04:38,532 --> 01:04:41,371
Okay. Let's remind ourselves about the front-grabber.

1774
01:04:41,372 --> 01:04:42,542
(Thinking)

1775
01:04:42,742 --> 01:04:44,711
Since it's the front-grabber, it has to do with "the front."

1776
01:04:44,712 --> 01:04:46,541
- That's also true.
- Right?

1777
01:04:46,542 --> 01:04:47,611
(Agreed)

1778
01:04:47,612 --> 01:04:50,182
Is it the one who puts the ingredients...

1779
01:04:51,182 --> 01:04:52,581
in the front?

1780
01:04:52,582 --> 01:04:54,752
I thought so when I saw this photo.

1781
01:04:55,122 --> 01:04:56,721
- The ingredient supplier.
- The one with the ingredients.

1782
01:04:56,722 --> 01:04:57,851
(Was a front-grabber the one who supplied ingredients?)

1783
01:04:57,852 --> 01:04:59,991
The owner grabbed them...

1784
01:04:59,992 --> 01:05:01,261
- That's your grandfather.
- and carried them himself.

1785
01:05:01,262 --> 01:05:02,421
- I have a good feeling about it.
- Right?

1786
01:05:02,422 --> 01:05:03,792
It sounds about right.

1787
01:05:04,222 --> 01:05:05,792
How should we put them together?

1788
01:05:06,892 --> 01:05:08,202
I have to put it...

1789
01:05:09,332 --> 01:05:10,452
so that it sounds plausible.

1790
01:05:10,762 --> 01:05:11,831
- Just try it.
- Right?

1791
01:05:11,832 --> 01:05:12,971
We're almost there.

1792
01:05:12,972 --> 01:05:14,072
(Just say it.)

1793
01:05:14,402 --> 01:05:16,701
Here's our answer. Please listen carefully.

1794
01:05:16,702 --> 01:05:17,702
Your answer.

1795
01:05:18,642 --> 01:05:20,872
When making Pyongyang naengmyeon,

1796
01:05:21,442 --> 01:05:22,841
they need many ingredients.

1797
01:05:22,842 --> 01:05:24,412
Yes. It must be hard.

1798
01:05:24,582 --> 01:05:27,882
They grab the ingredients and prepare them.

1799
01:05:28,182 --> 01:05:30,251
The one who makes the broth with those ingredients.

1800
01:05:30,252 --> 01:05:32,151
(The one who made the broth using the prepped ingredients)

1801
01:05:32,152 --> 01:05:34,291
It's vague, but it has all the necessary words in it.

1802
01:05:34,292 --> 01:05:35,322
You're right.

1803
01:05:35,992 --> 01:05:37,191
That's how we're supposed to do it.

1804
01:05:37,192 --> 01:05:39,332
(That's how we're supposed to do it.)

1805
01:05:39,532 --> 01:05:40,931
(Brazen)

1806
01:05:40,932 --> 01:05:42,232
- Come on.
- What?

1807
01:05:42,902 --> 01:05:47,231
(Will it be correct?)

1808
01:05:47,232 --> 01:05:48,441
(The one who made the broth using the prepped ingredients)

1809
01:05:48,442 --> 01:05:49,642
It's not correct.

1810
01:05:50,302 --> 01:05:51,672
- Not at all?
- Not at all?

1811
01:05:51,972 --> 01:05:53,012
It's incorrect.

1812
01:05:53,142 --> 01:05:54,241
Use the card for now.

1813
01:05:54,242 --> 01:05:55,842
We have to calm down. We have no choice.

1814
01:05:55,912 --> 01:05:57,442
It must be far from what we said.

1815
01:05:57,742 --> 01:05:59,251
You used the reattempt card.

1816
01:05:59,252 --> 01:06:01,011
We used our only reattempt card.

1817
01:06:01,012 --> 01:06:02,322
- I'll give you a hint.
- Okay.

1818
01:06:02,682 --> 01:06:04,951
The front-grabber did the task...

1819
01:06:04,952 --> 01:06:06,992
right before the garnish-placer.

1820
01:06:07,622 --> 01:06:09,998
Isn't it the one you mentioned? The one who boils the noodles?

1821
01:06:10,022 --> 01:06:11,332
Before putting the garnish,

1822
01:06:11,562 --> 01:06:13,108
they place the noodles and pour the broth.

1823
01:06:13,132 --> 01:06:14,132
I got it.

1824
01:06:14,462 --> 01:06:18,072
They grab the noodles and place them like this.

1825
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:20,701
The one who grabs, rolls, and places the noodles.

1826
01:06:20,702 --> 01:06:22,202
- Yes.
- Seung Ho, let's go.

1827
01:06:22,302 --> 01:06:23,441
Let's go with the one who places the noodles.

1828
01:06:23,442 --> 01:06:24,771
- Let's do that.
- Yes.

1829
01:06:24,772 --> 01:06:26,941
We'll go with the one who places the noodles.

1830
01:06:26,942 --> 01:06:29,482
They grab the noodles as they are front-grabbers.

1831
01:06:29,712 --> 01:06:32,181
The one who grabs the noodles and place them in a bowl.

1832
01:06:32,182 --> 01:06:35,551
(The one who grabs the noodles and place them in a bowl)

1833
01:06:35,552 --> 01:06:36,652
- Correct.
- Gosh.

1834
01:06:36,822 --> 01:06:38,452
I thought he'd say "Incorrect" again.

1835
01:06:38,752 --> 01:06:40,552
- Gosh.
- Good job.

1836
01:06:41,152 --> 01:06:42,221
That was a hard one.

1837
01:06:42,222 --> 01:06:43,742
- That was really hard.
- It was hard.

1838
01:06:44,222 --> 01:06:45,561
(Useless knowledge on naengmyeon)

1839
01:06:45,562 --> 01:06:47,668
(Let's learn about the division of work in naengmyeon-making.)

1840
01:06:47,692 --> 01:06:51,202
(The one who boils the noodles is a boiler.)

1841
01:06:51,702 --> 01:06:54,002
(The one who washes the cooked noodles in cold water...)

1842
01:06:54,802 --> 01:06:56,741
(rolls into a ball...)

1843
01:06:56,742 --> 01:06:58,041
(of 1 serving size...)

1844
01:06:58,042 --> 01:07:00,312
(is a front-grabber.)

1845
01:07:02,312 --> 01:07:04,141
(The one who places garnishes one by one on the noodles...)

1846
01:07:04,142 --> 01:07:07,112
(is called a garnish-placer.)

1847
01:07:08,022 --> 01:07:09,882
Anyhow, I took care of Sokcho, then.

1848
01:07:11,322 --> 01:07:12,842
- Don't say that.
- I'll exercise too.

1849
01:07:13,652 --> 01:07:14,972
- Front-grabber.
- Front-grabber.

1850
01:07:17,262 --> 01:07:19,732
(Sokcho A: Hamheung naengmyeon)

1851
01:07:20,232 --> 01:07:22,062
(Team Guys)

1852
01:07:22,902 --> 01:07:25,031
(Jjamppong)

1853
01:07:25,032 --> 01:07:27,572
It must be a famous restaurant. My goodness.

1854
01:07:27,772 --> 01:07:28,872
I can't believe it.

1855
01:07:29,342 --> 01:07:32,572
- Hello.
- My goodness.

1856
01:07:33,212 --> 01:07:35,412
We visited a famous restaurant.

1857
01:07:36,212 --> 01:07:37,341
(The photos on the wall show that it's a famous restaurant.)

1858
01:07:37,342 --> 01:07:39,152
I see that this place is popular.

1859
01:07:39,552 --> 01:07:41,982
I see that this is the main restaurant.

1860
01:07:42,152 --> 01:07:44,422
- I see.
- This is the main restaurant.

1861
01:07:44,482 --> 01:07:47,651
- The branches are everywhere.
- It's a famous restaurant chain.

1862
01:07:47,652 --> 01:07:49,261
This is the main restaurant.

1863
01:07:49,262 --> 01:07:50,262
(It's famous as 1 of the top 5 jjamppong places in the nation.)

1864
01:07:50,263 --> 01:07:51,492
I'm excited.

1865
01:07:51,632 --> 01:07:53,562
- It'll be spicy.
- I know.

1866
01:07:53,892 --> 01:07:55,831
- Welcome.
- Hello.

1867
01:07:55,832 --> 01:07:57,661
- I'm sorry, - Yes?

1868
01:07:57,662 --> 01:07:59,031
- but is there a double portion?
- Yes.

1869
01:07:59,032 --> 01:08:00,071
- Really?
- One double portion jjamppong.

1870
01:08:00,072 --> 01:08:01,971
- One double portion jjamppong?
- Yes, thank you.

1871
01:08:01,972 --> 01:08:03,502
We're set.

1872
01:08:03,602 --> 01:08:05,072
The soup is tasty.

1873
01:08:07,272 --> 01:08:08,281
(Gulping)

1874
01:08:08,282 --> 01:08:09,312
Listen.

1875
01:08:09,442 --> 01:08:11,652
We decided on something on our way here.

1876
01:08:13,012 --> 01:08:14,921
- Let's say we get this square.
- We get this square.

1877
01:08:14,922 --> 01:08:16,421
Let's say we get the jang kalguksu one as well.

1878
01:08:16,422 --> 01:08:17,922
- We get it.
- We get it as well.

1879
01:08:18,222 --> 01:08:19,952
- Then...
- Then we won't go.

1880
01:08:20,092 --> 01:08:21,221
- Where?
- You guys won't go?

1881
01:08:21,222 --> 01:08:23,921
That's right. We won't go up. We'll go back to Pyeongchang...

1882
01:08:23,922 --> 01:08:25,062
and enjoy snow sledding.

1883
01:08:25,762 --> 01:08:28,232
Then we'll leave things up to fate.

1884
01:08:28,332 --> 01:08:30,002
It'll be uncertain if we get one square.

1885
01:08:30,202 --> 01:08:32,302
- It'll be uncertain then.
- Seriously.

1886
01:08:32,532 --> 01:08:36,042
It'll be uncertain. Do we go sledding? Do we give up?

1887
01:08:36,602 --> 01:08:38,071
The best option is getting two squares...

1888
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:40,312
- and leaving to enjoy sledding.
- It's the best option.

1889
01:08:41,072 --> 01:08:42,081
It'll be the best.

1890
01:08:42,082 --> 01:08:43,382
(Desperate)

1891
01:08:43,982 --> 01:08:45,551
(Jjamppong gets served as they have a happy imagination.)

1892
01:08:45,552 --> 01:08:46,552
Thank you for coming.

1893
01:08:46,553 --> 01:08:48,221
- Don't mention it.
- Thank you.

1894
01:08:48,222 --> 01:08:49,952
- Please enjoy it.
- Thank you.

1895
01:08:51,122 --> 01:08:53,392
- It looks so nice.
- Go ahead and eat.

1896
01:08:53,792 --> 01:08:55,861
(It's characterized by spicy soup with a smoky flavor.)

1897
01:08:55,862 --> 01:08:57,022
It's so red.

1898
01:08:59,192 --> 01:09:03,732
(It's full of various seafood and meat!)

1899
01:09:04,632 --> 01:09:06,302
- Let's enjoy the soup.
- Thank you.

1900
01:09:10,942 --> 01:09:11,942
(My goodness)

1901
01:09:12,872 --> 01:09:13,971
It's spicy.

1902
01:09:13,972 --> 01:09:15,282
(It's refreshing.)

1903
01:09:15,412 --> 01:09:17,482
- You know, it's tasty.
- It's tasty.

1904
01:09:21,852 --> 01:09:22,922
Take a lot.

1905
01:09:23,822 --> 01:09:27,952
(He gets a pile of noodles and prepares for an eating show.)

1906
01:09:29,592 --> 01:09:31,662
(Slurping)

1907
01:09:32,362 --> 01:09:35,232
(He slurps the noodles without hesitation.)

1908
01:09:36,162 --> 01:09:42,441
(The jjamppong lover takes a big bite too.)

1909
01:09:42,442 --> 01:09:44,602
It isn't too spicy. It's tasty.

1910
01:09:48,242 --> 01:09:50,481
(The small eater who can't eat spicy food, )

1911
01:09:50,482 --> 01:09:52,712
(Tae Hyun takes a small mouthful.)

1912
01:09:55,182 --> 01:09:56,752
(It's tasty.)

1913
01:10:01,622 --> 01:10:03,891
It's nice. The noodles are soft.

1914
01:10:03,892 --> 01:10:05,068
(When Sang Uk slurps the noodles, )

1915
01:10:05,092 --> 01:10:07,531
(Sung Hoon slurps the noodles as well.)

1916
01:10:07,532 --> 01:10:09,632
I can eat it, so the level of spiciness is moderate.

1917
01:10:10,162 --> 01:10:11,162
It isn't too spicy.

1918
01:10:11,532 --> 01:10:14,372
I visit many jjamppong restaurants because I like the dish.

1919
01:10:14,572 --> 01:10:16,141
- Is it different?
- It's so tasty.

1920
01:10:16,142 --> 01:10:17,671
- Is it definitely different?
- It's definitely different.

1921
01:10:17,672 --> 01:10:21,271
The jjamppong at this restaurant chain has...

1922
01:10:21,272 --> 01:10:22,512
a specific smell.

1923
01:10:22,742 --> 01:10:24,042
That smell is so strong.

1924
01:10:27,082 --> 01:10:28,082
(Satisfied)

1925
01:10:28,083 --> 01:10:29,182
It's tasty.

1926
01:10:29,752 --> 01:10:32,222
I see that the soup is thick.

1927
01:10:32,952 --> 01:10:34,492
It's refreshing.

1928
01:10:36,662 --> 01:10:37,962
This place is nice.

1929
01:10:38,262 --> 01:10:39,292
Just a little bit.

1930
01:10:39,432 --> 01:10:40,631
Thank you.

1931
01:10:40,632 --> 01:10:43,232
(The two men are done eating.)

1932
01:10:43,632 --> 01:10:47,131
(However, Sang Uk's mouth is full.)

1933
01:10:47,132 --> 01:10:48,301
The taste makes you crave for more.

1934
01:10:48,302 --> 01:10:54,512
(The taste makes him crave for more and he eats endlessly.)

1935
01:10:55,282 --> 01:10:58,081
(Slurping)

1936
01:10:58,082 --> 01:11:00,682
(Slurping)

1937
01:11:01,682 --> 01:11:04,421
(He's practically licking the bowl clean.)

1938
01:11:04,422 --> 01:11:07,251
It's so tasty. The soup is so refreshing.

1939
01:11:07,252 --> 01:11:08,262
(Let's go now.)

1940
01:11:09,722 --> 01:11:14,392
(Did you think that I was done?)

1941
01:11:16,862 --> 01:11:17,862
(Done)

1942
01:11:18,272 --> 01:11:19,831
Let's go.

1943
01:11:19,832 --> 01:11:22,041
(They go to answer the quiz after finishing jjamppong!)

1944
01:11:22,042 --> 01:11:23,242
Thank you for the food.

1945
01:11:23,442 --> 01:11:24,772
They go to answer the quiz.

1946
01:11:25,812 --> 01:11:26,912
Here comes the question.

1947
01:11:27,812 --> 01:11:29,481
You just enjoyed squid...

1948
01:11:29,482 --> 01:11:30,841
inside jjamppong, right?

1949
01:11:30,842 --> 01:11:33,252
- Squid was tasty.
- I guess this one is about squid.

1950
01:11:34,112 --> 01:11:36,082
According to an old fable,

1951
01:11:36,722 --> 01:11:38,952
a "Blank" was trying to catch a squid.

1952
01:11:39,292 --> 01:11:41,321
It charged at the squid that was pretending to be dead...

1953
01:11:41,322 --> 01:11:42,761
at the surface of the water.

1954
01:11:42,762 --> 01:11:44,222
It charged at the squid.

1955
01:11:44,322 --> 01:11:46,161
The squid wrapped its legs around it...

1956
01:11:46,162 --> 01:11:48,932
and dragged it into the sea.

1957
01:11:49,002 --> 01:11:50,431
- Thus, - Is it a gull?

1958
01:11:50,432 --> 01:11:55,742
"O" for "Blank," "Jeok" for "Thief," and "Eo" for "Fish" got combined...

1959
01:11:55,842 --> 01:11:58,072
and squid was called "Ojeokeo" in the past.

1960
01:11:58,712 --> 01:12:00,411
What goes in the blank?

1961
01:12:00,412 --> 01:12:01,682
So what does "O" mean?

1962
01:12:01,742 --> 01:12:03,711
That's what you need to guess. "O" is a character for "Blank."

1963
01:12:03,712 --> 01:12:05,928
- "O" is a character for "Blank." - "O" is a character for "Blank."

1964
01:12:05,952 --> 01:12:08,112
A person? Is it a person?

1965
01:12:08,252 --> 01:12:10,022
We don't know if it's a person.

1966
01:12:10,152 --> 01:12:11,481
I see.

1967
01:12:11,482 --> 01:12:13,691
- It has to be a bird.
- No.

1968
01:12:13,692 --> 01:12:15,621
- A bird?
- I bet it attacked from the above.

1969
01:12:15,622 --> 01:12:17,791
- That's right. It was my guess.
- It attacked from the above...

1970
01:12:17,792 --> 01:12:18,792
and the squid dragged it down.

1971
01:12:18,793 --> 01:12:21,901
If it's a bird, it's a raven.

1972
01:12:21,902 --> 01:12:24,102
Isn't "O" a character for "Raven?"

1973
01:12:24,902 --> 01:12:25,931
- Isn't it?
- "O" for "Raven?"

1974
01:12:25,932 --> 01:12:28,641
- Ravens are smart.
- My guess was a gull.

1975
01:12:28,642 --> 01:12:29,771
- A gull?
- Isn't it a gull?

1976
01:12:29,772 --> 01:12:32,642
Sung Hoon, what Chinese characters are there...

1977
01:12:32,972 --> 01:12:34,142
for "O?"

1978
01:12:34,312 --> 01:12:37,081
- Is it hard since it's Korean.
- It's Korean.

1979
01:12:37,082 --> 01:12:38,311
Sung Hoon, raven...

1980
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:40,312
Raven is "Karasu" in Japanese.

1981
01:12:40,382 --> 01:12:42,351
- It means nothing to us.
- So...

1982
01:12:42,352 --> 01:12:44,181
the character isn't read as "O."

1983
01:12:44,182 --> 01:12:47,291
So "O" isn't a character for "Raven" in Japan.

1984
01:12:47,292 --> 01:12:50,162
But ravens don't live at the sea.

1985
01:12:50,462 --> 01:12:52,191
That's right. Only gulls live there.

1986
01:12:52,192 --> 01:12:53,192
(In agreement)

1987
01:12:53,193 --> 01:12:54,332
I don't know.

1988
01:12:54,762 --> 01:12:56,901
- Shall we give up?
- Hold on.

1989
01:12:56,902 --> 01:12:58,031
Shall we go snow sledding?

1990
01:12:58,032 --> 01:12:59,401
(Giving up)

1991
01:12:59,402 --> 01:13:02,041
There was a four-character idiom that contained "O."

1992
01:13:02,042 --> 01:13:04,342
It meant, "A pear falls when a raven flies."

1993
01:13:04,542 --> 01:13:07,912
It contained "O" and "Rak."

1994
01:13:08,342 --> 01:13:11,212
"A pear falls when a raven flies."

1995
01:13:11,752 --> 01:13:12,882
For goodness' sake,

1996
01:13:13,182 --> 01:13:14,412
- I don't know.
- You know it.

1997
01:13:14,652 --> 01:13:16,621
"O" and "Rak?" What is it?

1998
01:13:16,622 --> 01:13:18,791
- An idiom about something falling.
- That's right.

1999
01:13:18,792 --> 01:13:21,692
"A pear falls when a raven flies."

2000
01:13:22,322 --> 01:13:24,661
That's it. That idiom contains "O..."

2001
01:13:24,662 --> 01:13:26,292
because "O" is a character for "Raven."

2002
01:13:27,062 --> 01:13:29,762
- What's the idiom?
- I don't know.

2003
01:13:30,762 --> 01:13:31,771
(Sitting down)

2004
01:13:31,772 --> 01:13:32,831
That idiom...

2005
01:13:32,832 --> 01:13:34,771
- Why are you guys sitting down?
- That idiom...

2006
01:13:34,772 --> 01:13:37,401
You guys need to wait.

2007
01:13:37,402 --> 01:13:38,542
Hold on.

2008
01:13:38,612 --> 01:13:40,741
But I've never seen a raven at the sea.

2009
01:13:40,742 --> 01:13:42,641
- They don't live at the sea.
- But the question...

2010
01:13:42,642 --> 01:13:44,341
Shall we drink coffee?

2011
01:13:44,342 --> 01:13:45,412
(Carefree)

2012
01:13:46,382 --> 01:13:47,751
- It's black.
- That's right.

2013
01:13:47,752 --> 01:13:50,421
- Firstly...
- Coffee.

2014
01:13:50,422 --> 01:13:52,622
- Think about it.
- Okay.

2015
01:13:52,752 --> 01:13:54,322
- This is...
- Bring us coffee.

2016
01:13:54,952 --> 01:13:57,062
O... Oyiyirak.

2017
01:13:57,362 --> 01:13:58,692
Obiyirak.

2018
01:13:59,132 --> 01:14:00,292
Obiyirak.

2019
01:14:00,892 --> 01:14:02,931
Isn't it "Obiyirak?"

2020
01:14:02,932 --> 01:14:04,631
In any case, that's what I think.

2021
01:14:04,632 --> 01:14:07,602
But we don't think ravens live at the sea.

2022
01:14:07,772 --> 01:14:10,372
However, the question contains a hint.

2023
01:14:10,702 --> 01:14:12,911
This thing approached the squid thinking that it was dead.

2024
01:14:12,912 --> 01:14:14,642
Are you only looking at coffee?

2025
01:14:15,112 --> 01:14:18,082
(My coffee is more important than the quiz.)

2026
01:14:18,812 --> 01:14:20,351
You always remain the same.

2027
01:14:20,352 --> 01:14:21,581
(He's an unpredictable guy.)

2028
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:23,422
I thought you were looking at me.

2029
01:14:25,622 --> 01:14:27,852
All right. Let's go. Let us answer.

2030
01:14:28,492 --> 01:14:29,492
This is incredible.

2031
01:14:29,592 --> 01:14:30,821
- Raven?
- Raven.

2032
01:14:30,822 --> 01:14:32,431
- But raven...
- Raven.

2033
01:14:32,432 --> 01:14:33,661
- It's raven.
- No.

2034
01:14:33,662 --> 01:14:35,502
- No?
- It's correct.

2035
01:14:35,932 --> 01:14:37,231
- What's correct?
- Raven is correct.

2036
01:14:37,232 --> 01:14:39,371
That was very sudden. Why do you think it's correct?

2037
01:14:39,372 --> 01:14:40,632
I'll tell you later.

2038
01:14:40,672 --> 01:14:42,241
- Is that so? Okay.
- All right.

2039
01:14:42,242 --> 01:14:43,601
- Okay.
- Raven.

2040
01:14:43,602 --> 01:14:44,801
- Okay. What was that?
- We have the answer.

2041
01:14:44,802 --> 01:14:47,141
- Let us answer.
- Did you see something?

2042
01:14:47,142 --> 01:14:48,212
Let us answer.

2043
01:14:48,842 --> 01:14:50,411
- All right.
- One, two, three.

2044
01:14:50,412 --> 01:14:51,611
- Raven.
- Raven.

2045
01:14:51,612 --> 01:14:53,881
(Answer: Raven)

2046
01:14:53,882 --> 01:14:55,852
Your answer is raven.

2047
01:15:01,152 --> 01:15:02,191
Correct.

2048
01:15:02,192 --> 01:15:04,592
(It's correct!)

2049
01:15:05,392 --> 01:15:08,601
- See? I told you!
- How did you know?

2050
01:15:08,602 --> 01:15:10,161
- How did you know?
- See?

2051
01:15:10,162 --> 01:15:11,801
What was that at the end?

2052
01:15:11,802 --> 01:15:15,471
- Our guess was raven, right?
- Yes.

2053
01:15:15,472 --> 01:15:18,172
The director began filming then.

2054
01:15:18,572 --> 01:15:20,511
- That's ridiculous.
- He did that...

2055
01:15:20,512 --> 01:15:22,412
because he wanted to film us answer correctly.

2056
01:15:22,942 --> 01:15:24,381
I thought you had a better reason.

2057
01:15:24,382 --> 01:15:25,352
(He pressed the button by mistake.)

2058
01:15:25,353 --> 01:15:26,751
Yes.

2059
01:15:26,752 --> 01:15:27,981
- We...
- Nice.

2060
01:15:27,982 --> 01:15:29,382
We can go snow sledding.

2061
01:15:29,982 --> 01:15:32,191
Hey, let's go right away.

2062
01:15:32,192 --> 01:15:33,351
(They get closer to snow sledding.)

2063
01:15:33,352 --> 01:15:34,592
One, two.

2064
01:15:35,822 --> 01:15:37,292
- Raven.
- Raven.

2065
01:15:37,592 --> 01:15:39,492
(Gangneung B: Jjamppong)

2066
01:15:40,092 --> 01:15:41,438
- This place makes tasty coffee.
- Exercise.

2067
01:15:41,462 --> 01:15:42,831
- Exercise.
- That's right.

2068
01:15:42,832 --> 01:15:44,331
- I forgot about that.
- What's the exercise?

2069
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:46,071
Must we exercise?

2070
01:15:46,072 --> 01:15:47,271
It's spinning.

2071
01:15:47,272 --> 01:15:48,272
- No!
- No! We have to transfer it.

2072
01:15:48,273 --> 01:15:50,042
We can't transfer it.

2073
01:15:50,572 --> 01:15:52,541
- What?
- We can't transfer it.

2074
01:15:52,542 --> 01:15:53,711
Spinning, 30 minutes.

2075
01:15:53,712 --> 01:15:55,411
- What's "Spinni?" - Indoor cycling.

2076
01:15:55,412 --> 01:15:56,692
We need to cycle for 30 minutes.

2077
01:15:56,742 --> 01:15:58,112
Thirty minutes?

2078
01:15:58,852 --> 01:16:01,011
Then we'll need to change into exercise clothes.

2079
01:16:01,012 --> 01:16:03,521
It isn't cycling we have in mind.

2080
01:16:03,522 --> 01:16:05,082
- Music will be played.
- You'll see.

2081
01:16:05,422 --> 01:16:07,951
- To the music...
- It's like...

2082
01:16:07,952 --> 01:16:10,291
The music will go, "Square, square."

2083
01:16:10,292 --> 01:16:11,791
- You'll see.
- Really?

2084
01:16:11,792 --> 01:16:12,832
It's something like that.

2085
01:16:13,092 --> 01:16:14,291
- Is it something like that?
- Yes.

2086
01:16:14,292 --> 01:16:16,962
(He's nervous already.)

2087
01:16:17,032 --> 01:16:18,062
Let's go.

2088
01:16:18,262 --> 01:16:20,172
Thank you for the coffee.

2089
01:16:20,502 --> 01:16:22,341
We need to exercise to eat.

2090
01:16:22,342 --> 01:16:23,602
(Team Handsome)

2091
01:16:23,742 --> 01:16:25,872
- Do we need to go up there?
- Yes.

2092
01:16:26,212 --> 01:16:27,411
(Team Handsome's exercise time)

2093
01:16:27,412 --> 01:16:29,742
(Lighthouse Observatory: Altitude of 66m)

2094
01:16:32,682 --> 01:16:36,652
(Go up the steep staircase...)

2095
01:16:37,982 --> 01:16:41,892
(and enjoy the blue sea of Sokcho.)

2096
01:16:42,622 --> 01:16:43,692
Sokcho Lighthouse.

2097
01:16:44,292 --> 01:16:45,292
Look at the stairs.

2098
01:16:45,293 --> 01:16:47,293
We'll lose the weight we gained by eating noodles.

2099
01:16:47,662 --> 01:16:50,131
- Hello.
- Hello.

2100
01:16:50,132 --> 01:16:51,801
If this is the steepness,

2101
01:16:51,802 --> 01:16:53,522
we'll reach the altitude of 66m in no time.

2102
01:16:54,202 --> 01:16:55,441
The staircase isn't too long.

2103
01:16:55,442 --> 01:16:56,641
(Team Handsome)

2104
01:16:56,642 --> 01:16:57,701
(Destination)

2105
01:16:57,702 --> 01:16:59,041
(However)

2106
01:16:59,042 --> 01:17:02,012
(Exhausted)

2107
01:17:04,312 --> 01:17:06,192
- Can we see the sea?
- The view is incredible.

2108
01:17:06,752 --> 01:17:08,212
(Retching)

2109
01:17:09,152 --> 01:17:10,252
Are you okay?

2110
01:17:10,822 --> 01:17:11,822
Gosh.

2111
01:17:11,823 --> 01:17:14,352
(The intense staircase makes him cough.)

2112
01:17:15,092 --> 01:17:18,092
(Panting)

2113
01:17:18,492 --> 01:17:19,531
No way.

2114
01:17:19,532 --> 01:17:20,631
(Heaving)

2115
01:17:20,632 --> 01:17:21,762
It's so pretty.

2116
01:17:23,332 --> 01:17:25,001
(He spots something.)

2117
01:17:25,002 --> 01:17:27,502
- We should try it. It's a must.
- Let's do it.

2118
01:17:29,842 --> 01:17:31,242
Gosh, I can't go through it.

2119
01:17:31,742 --> 01:17:33,862
But I should get a pass since my chest was too thick.

2120
01:17:34,142 --> 01:17:36,681
(I want to try it as well.)

2121
01:17:36,682 --> 01:17:37,841
Wait for me.

2122
01:17:37,842 --> 01:17:39,452
You guys are too much.

2123
01:17:39,852 --> 01:17:42,252
You guys should watch me do it at least once.

2124
01:17:42,652 --> 01:17:45,121
Speed is crucial.

2125
01:17:45,122 --> 01:17:46,752
(Speed is crucial in a race.)

2126
01:17:46,922 --> 01:17:49,291
(The stairs aren't over yet.)

2127
01:17:49,292 --> 01:17:50,562
The stairs...

2128
01:17:51,122 --> 01:17:52,562
I see that the altitude of 66m...

2129
01:17:53,162 --> 01:17:54,792
isn't easy.

2130
01:17:56,402 --> 01:17:57,602
We need to go up further.

2131
01:17:58,162 --> 01:17:59,371
Stop going!

2132
01:17:59,372 --> 01:18:01,002
(Stop going!)

2133
01:18:01,102 --> 01:18:02,641
How is their stamina so good?

2134
01:18:02,642 --> 01:18:04,142
(How is their stamina so good?)

2135
01:18:04,272 --> 01:18:06,871
(They go up a bit higher.)

2136
01:18:06,872 --> 01:18:08,242
The sea is no joke.

2137
01:18:09,812 --> 01:18:11,342
(Exclaiming)

2138
01:18:12,352 --> 01:18:14,082
This place is so pretty.

2139
01:18:14,582 --> 01:18:15,822
It's incredible.

2140
01:18:16,052 --> 01:18:17,652
I didn't know that such a place existed.

2141
01:18:22,062 --> 01:18:26,962
(The dazzling sea of Sokcho makes them forget the pain.)

2142
01:18:28,032 --> 01:18:31,461
(The calm horizon...)

2143
01:18:31,462 --> 01:18:35,441
(and the breaking waves)

2144
01:18:35,442 --> 01:18:37,278
The scenery makes me take out the camera automatically.

2145
01:18:37,302 --> 01:18:40,112
"Today's weather is no joke."

2146
01:18:40,712 --> 01:18:42,312
"Haeng Bae."

2147
01:18:43,012 --> 01:18:44,112
"Right?"

2148
01:18:44,782 --> 01:18:46,412
This reminds me of that scene.

2149
01:18:48,182 --> 01:18:51,122
"Today's weather is no joke."

2150
01:18:51,582 --> 01:18:53,292
"Haeng Bae."

2151
01:18:53,892 --> 01:18:54,952
"Right?"

2152
01:18:55,222 --> 01:18:58,061
"A man like me should've been a soldier."

2153
01:18:58,062 --> 01:18:59,862
(His voice impression is spot on.)

2154
01:19:00,062 --> 01:19:01,062
Gosh.

2155
01:19:01,063 --> 01:19:02,732
It lightens the heart.

2156
01:19:02,932 --> 01:19:04,701
This place is so pretty.

2157
01:19:04,702 --> 01:19:05,972
(It's so pretty.)

2158
01:19:06,532 --> 01:19:08,331
- Hello.
- It startled me.

2159
01:19:08,332 --> 01:19:10,141
Hello.

2160
01:19:10,142 --> 01:19:12,071
- Bye.
- It always goes into a distance.

2161
01:19:12,072 --> 01:19:13,442
Watch out for the gulls.

2162
01:19:14,242 --> 01:19:15,342
You might bump into one.

2163
01:19:18,442 --> 01:19:20,182
This place is so pretty.

2164
01:19:20,582 --> 01:19:22,982
I bet you noticed. When we're on a race,

2165
01:19:23,152 --> 01:19:24,351
we usually go, "We checked it out. Lets go."

2166
01:19:24,352 --> 01:19:27,022
But we're spending time here.

2167
01:19:27,222 --> 01:19:28,721
Then...

2168
01:19:28,722 --> 01:19:30,291
we should go to Sokcho B, right?

2169
01:19:30,292 --> 01:19:31,591
One square...

2170
01:19:31,592 --> 01:19:33,031
What? It's an alarm.

2171
01:19:33,032 --> 01:19:34,462
Gangneung B.

2172
01:19:34,492 --> 01:19:36,331
- What? Gangneung B?
- B.

2173
01:19:36,332 --> 01:19:37,662
They went to B first.

2174
01:19:37,832 --> 01:19:39,001
It's the square next to it.

2175
01:19:39,002 --> 01:19:41,571
Please check the time. I'll take note.

2176
01:19:41,572 --> 01:19:43,671
We were going to stay a bit longer, but the alarm went off.

2177
01:19:43,672 --> 01:19:44,771
- Right.
- Let's hit the road.

2178
01:19:44,772 --> 01:19:46,211
- Let's go.
- We're behind by one again.

2179
01:19:46,212 --> 01:19:48,118
Let's get another square so that it'll be a tie.

2180
01:19:48,142 --> 01:19:49,712
Let's get it as soon as possible.

2181
01:19:50,012 --> 01:19:51,112
Let's exercise.

2182
01:19:51,212 --> 01:19:54,182
We had a meal, so it'll be nice to exercise.

2183
01:19:54,212 --> 01:19:56,421
After 30 minutes of spinning,

2184
01:19:56,422 --> 01:19:58,262
we'll be able to eat jang kalguksu right away.

2185
01:19:58,452 --> 01:20:02,622
(Someone is waiting for them.)

2186
01:20:02,792 --> 01:20:05,491
- We must exercise for 30 minutes.
- For 30 minutes.

2187
01:20:05,492 --> 01:20:06,938
(They enter without knowing anything.)

2188
01:20:06,962 --> 01:20:08,062
For 30 minutes.

2189
01:20:08,962 --> 01:20:11,432
Does the clock start as soon as we enter?

2190
01:20:12,172 --> 01:20:14,332
- For goodness' sake.
- Hello.

2191
01:20:15,502 --> 01:20:18,201
It's my second business trip.

2192
01:20:18,202 --> 01:20:19,971
He's an actual instructor.

2193
01:20:19,972 --> 01:20:21,211
- Hello.
- You know...

2194
01:20:21,212 --> 01:20:22,281
He's a spinning instructor.

2195
01:20:22,282 --> 01:20:23,681
I saw him on social media.

2196
01:20:23,682 --> 01:20:26,011
(A famous spinning YouTuber Sung Hoon knows about)

2197
01:20:26,012 --> 01:20:28,612
I heard that you ate a lot.

2198
01:20:30,252 --> 01:20:31,921
- You know how to do it, right?
- Yes, I do.

2199
01:20:31,922 --> 01:20:33,722
- You did it the last time.
- Yes.

2200
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:36,822
If you want to stop, please press the red button.

2201
01:20:37,492 --> 01:20:38,721
(They're ready.)

2202
01:20:38,722 --> 01:20:41,191
I didn't expect to see him here.

2203
01:20:41,192 --> 01:20:43,302
Let's start the first song.

2204
01:20:43,362 --> 01:20:44,632
Do a body roll.

2205
01:20:45,362 --> 01:20:47,201
"What should I do?"

2206
01:20:47,202 --> 01:20:48,271
Do it cutely.

2207
01:20:48,272 --> 01:20:49,501
"What should I do?"

2208
01:20:49,502 --> 01:20:50,502
(Shocked)

2209
01:20:50,502 --> 01:20:51,502
Set...

2210
01:20:51,503 --> 01:20:52,641
For goodness' sake.

2211
01:20:52,642 --> 01:20:54,111
(Laughing)

2212
01:20:54,112 --> 01:20:55,271
Let's just exercise.

2213
01:20:55,272 --> 01:20:56,411
- "What should I do?" - "What should I do?"

2214
01:20:56,412 --> 01:20:57,641
Spinning is like this.

2215
01:20:57,642 --> 01:20:59,011
- It's a mix of exercise and dance.
- You know,

2216
01:20:59,012 --> 01:21:01,182
- spinning is like this.
- Really?

2217
01:21:01,582 --> 01:21:03,421
You have no customers, right?

2218
01:21:03,422 --> 01:21:05,382
- Customers...
- Who would like this?

2219
01:21:06,392 --> 01:21:08,321
- He has so many customers.
- He does?

2220
01:21:08,322 --> 01:21:09,691
- He has so many customers.
- Really?

2221
01:21:09,692 --> 01:21:11,391
People are so strange these days.

2222
01:21:11,392 --> 01:21:12,962
(People are so strange these days.)

2223
01:21:13,532 --> 01:21:15,231
I see. Are there people who like this?

2224
01:21:15,232 --> 01:21:17,462
- So many people like it.
- No way.

2225
01:21:17,762 --> 01:21:19,501
Everyone. Set, go.

2226
01:21:19,502 --> 01:21:23,171
- What should I do? Be cute.
- What should I do?

2227
01:21:23,172 --> 01:21:24,871
- You need to wink as well.
- Come on!

2228
01:21:24,872 --> 01:21:26,742
Winking isn't an exercise.

2229
01:21:27,112 --> 01:21:29,541
- You need to wink as well.
- For goodness' sake.

2230
01:21:29,542 --> 01:21:30,911
- These days...
- It's a leg exercise.

2231
01:21:30,912 --> 01:21:33,712
It works out the body and face.

2232
01:21:35,012 --> 01:21:37,651
Everyone, one more time. Set, go.

2233
01:21:37,652 --> 01:21:39,392
- What should I do?
- What should I do?

2234
01:21:39,922 --> 01:21:41,352
What should I do?

2235
01:21:41,892 --> 01:21:43,691
- What should I do?
- Wink. Okay.

2236
01:21:43,692 --> 01:21:45,792
Let's begin right away.

2237
01:21:46,262 --> 01:21:49,461
(They start spinning to the music!)

2238
01:21:49,462 --> 01:21:50,561
What should I do?

2239
01:21:50,562 --> 01:21:52,131
- What should I do?
- What should I do?

2240
01:21:52,132 --> 01:21:53,802
(Perfect teamwork)

2241
01:21:54,032 --> 01:21:57,041
(Is that what I need to do?)

2242
01:21:57,042 --> 01:21:58,301
Open your palm.

2243
01:21:58,302 --> 01:22:00,041
- Why is this exercise so...
- Set, go.

2244
01:22:00,042 --> 01:22:03,112
(He misses the beat.)

2245
01:22:03,782 --> 01:22:06,151
(He moves his hand like a windshield wiper.)

2246
01:22:06,152 --> 01:22:07,582
- The other hand.
- It's hard.

2247
01:22:07,882 --> 01:22:09,821
- It's hard.
- It's really hard.

2248
01:22:09,822 --> 01:22:11,382
- Seriously.
- Go down. Pull it up.

2249
01:22:12,522 --> 01:22:13,792
One more time.

2250
01:22:14,092 --> 01:22:16,121
(They look relaxed since it's their second time.)

2251
01:22:16,122 --> 01:22:17,392
Go down. Pull it up.

2252
01:22:17,962 --> 01:22:19,031
Dazzle.

2253
01:22:19,032 --> 01:22:20,132
(Dazzle)

2254
01:22:20,192 --> 01:22:21,232
Dazzle.

2255
01:22:22,762 --> 01:22:25,602
(He continues to be flustered.)

2256
01:22:25,702 --> 01:22:27,332
The ending pose.

2257
01:22:28,172 --> 01:22:29,871
(The ending pose?)

2258
01:22:29,872 --> 01:22:32,142
(The middle-aged man's pose)

2259
01:22:32,942 --> 01:22:34,072
Is it over?

2260
01:22:34,242 --> 01:22:36,782
(They finished the song safely.)

2261
01:22:37,342 --> 01:22:38,842
Shall we start the second song?

2262
01:22:39,282 --> 01:22:40,382
Do you need a moment?

2263
01:22:41,182 --> 01:22:43,852
(The members who have done it are relaxed.)

2264
01:22:44,382 --> 01:22:45,551
The side.

2265
01:22:45,552 --> 01:22:47,351
(The new member continues to make a mistake.)

2266
01:22:47,352 --> 01:22:48,492
Backward.

2267
01:22:48,862 --> 01:22:50,322
Going backward is hard.

2268
01:22:50,392 --> 01:22:52,161
How do I go backward?

2269
01:22:52,162 --> 01:22:53,192
(Begging)

2270
01:22:53,232 --> 01:22:54,361
It's nice since the song is nice.

2271
01:22:54,362 --> 01:22:55,662
Forward body roll.

2272
01:22:57,962 --> 01:22:59,371
Go backward that way.

2273
01:22:59,372 --> 01:23:01,072
Backward. There you go.

2274
01:23:01,432 --> 01:23:02,971
(Screaming)

2275
01:23:02,972 --> 01:23:05,371
(He enjoys it for a while.)

2276
01:23:05,372 --> 01:23:06,411
One more time.

2277
01:23:06,412 --> 01:23:10,482
(The muscular middle-aged man is about to cry.)

2278
01:23:10,682 --> 01:23:16,622
(His soul has left the body.)

2279
01:23:17,482 --> 01:23:18,991
I heard that you guys ate a lot.

2280
01:23:18,992 --> 01:23:20,652
(The class is rather Spartan.)

2281
01:23:20,822 --> 01:23:24,962
(They're exhausted as well.)

2282
01:23:25,662 --> 01:23:27,131
I'm sweating.

2283
01:23:27,132 --> 01:23:28,691
(Covered in sweat)

2284
01:23:28,692 --> 01:23:30,632
We'll be done after one more song.

2285
01:23:30,862 --> 01:23:33,271
As for this song, just think that you're at a club.

2286
01:23:33,272 --> 01:23:34,401
How nice.

2287
01:23:34,402 --> 01:23:35,802
Let's begin.

2288
01:23:36,242 --> 01:23:38,042
Gosh, this is nice.

2289
01:23:39,742 --> 01:23:41,042
This is nice.

2290
01:23:41,812 --> 01:23:43,881
All right. Let's pedal.

2291
01:23:43,882 --> 01:23:45,042
Let's go.

2292
01:23:45,142 --> 01:23:46,381
Hey.

2293
01:23:46,382 --> 01:23:49,682
(They liven up the atmosphere!)

2294
01:23:50,182 --> 01:23:51,321
(Are they at a club...)

2295
01:23:51,322 --> 01:23:54,422
(or a spinning class?)

2296
01:23:56,122 --> 01:23:57,991
Lala. Let's go.

2297
01:23:57,992 --> 01:24:01,531
(Absorbed)

2298
01:24:01,532 --> 01:24:03,002
Make it oilier.

2299
01:24:03,102 --> 01:24:05,162
(This is the perfect example of spinning.)

2300
01:24:05,462 --> 01:24:10,042
(They finally dance in sync now that the class is ending.)

2301
01:24:10,472 --> 01:24:13,311
(Team Guys members groove as if they're one.)

2302
01:24:13,312 --> 01:24:16,242
(He improved a lot.)

2303
01:24:16,312 --> 01:24:19,251
(They succeeded in finishing the last song!)

2304
01:24:19,252 --> 01:24:20,452
It was hard.

2305
01:24:21,112 --> 01:24:22,621
(Moved)

2306
01:24:22,622 --> 01:24:23,721
I'm sweating so much.

2307
01:24:23,722 --> 01:24:25,452
It was harder than I expected.

2308
01:24:26,322 --> 01:24:27,551
Breathe in.

2309
01:24:27,552 --> 01:24:28,651
(They burned their passion to the point of exhaustion.)

2310
01:24:28,652 --> 01:24:29,691
Breathe out.

2311
01:24:29,692 --> 01:24:32,162
- It's hard when the rhythm is off.
- You're right.

2312
01:24:32,692 --> 01:24:34,632
It was my first experience, but it was fun.

2313
01:24:35,132 --> 01:24:36,961
Mr. Hong, thank you so much.

2314
01:24:36,962 --> 01:24:39,402
- Thank you.
- Thank you for your hard work.

2315
01:24:39,472 --> 01:24:41,931
(He's the best instructor in the spinning scene.)

2316
01:24:41,932 --> 01:24:43,072
You might be surprised,

2317
01:24:43,202 --> 01:24:45,142
but the other team used a nap card.

2318
01:24:45,372 --> 01:24:46,471
(Team Handsome became anxious after coming down the lighthouse.)

2319
01:24:46,472 --> 01:24:47,612
Let's use a nap card.

2320
01:24:47,942 --> 01:24:49,182
- Now?
- Yes. Let's use it now.

2321
01:24:49,212 --> 01:24:50,611
- Really?
- Yes. We need to use it now.

2322
01:24:50,612 --> 01:24:51,681
Let's do that.

2323
01:24:51,682 --> 01:24:56,052
Then we'll use a 30-minute nap card.

2324
01:24:56,282 --> 01:24:57,521
A tranquilizer dart!

2325
01:24:57,522 --> 01:24:58,882
(A tranquilizer dart!)

2326
01:24:59,122 --> 01:25:00,721
(Team Guys will lose another 30 minutes.)

2327
01:25:00,722 --> 01:25:02,292
The other team used a nap card.

2328
01:25:04,522 --> 01:25:05,591
(We love it.)

2329
01:25:05,592 --> 01:25:06,661
We love it.

2330
01:25:06,662 --> 01:25:07,991
Let's go to the spa.

2331
01:25:07,992 --> 01:25:10,732
- Let's wash up and sleep.
- Okay.

2332
01:25:10,832 --> 01:25:12,032
How nice.

2333
01:25:12,372 --> 01:25:14,632
Can we sleep here? This is incredible.

2334
01:25:16,172 --> 01:25:17,602
I'm so thankful.

2335
01:25:18,072 --> 01:25:19,942
- How nice.
- My goodness.

2336
01:25:20,272 --> 01:25:21,672
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

2337
01:25:21,712 --> 01:25:23,042
It's so nice.

2338
01:25:23,682 --> 01:25:25,141
Can we enjoy such a luxury?

2339
01:25:25,142 --> 01:25:27,182
- It's so nice.
- They used it at the perfect time.

2340
01:25:28,652 --> 01:25:30,521
It's this song again.

2341
01:25:30,522 --> 01:25:32,391
(The lullaby gets played again.)

2342
01:25:32,392 --> 01:25:34,252
Nice.

2343
01:25:34,352 --> 01:25:37,821
How is it that we didn't hear the cuckoo sound?

2344
01:25:37,822 --> 01:25:38,862
(Is he sleeptalking?)

2345
01:25:39,092 --> 01:25:40,461
(They became the hare in "The Tortoise and the Hare.")

2346
01:25:40,462 --> 01:25:41,761
Have a nice nap.

2347
01:25:41,762 --> 01:25:45,021
(What will become of Team Guys?)

2348
01:25:45,155 --> 01:25:47,455
(The Noodle Road continues on.)

2349
01:25:47,655 --> 01:25:48,954
The seasoning is so tasty.

2350
01:25:48,955 --> 01:25:53,665
(The noodles bless them endlessly.)

2351
01:25:54,025 --> 01:25:58,265
(The food race is fun.)

2352
01:25:58,435 --> 01:26:02,774
(They're 100 percent satisfied with their jobs.)

2353
01:26:02,775 --> 01:26:04,435
Seriously, what did they do...

2354
01:26:04,975 --> 01:26:06,774
- all day?
- What did they do?

2355
01:26:06,775 --> 01:26:08,705
(Since they don't hear any alarms, )

2356
01:26:09,375 --> 01:26:12,414
(they become hopeful.)

2357
01:26:12,415 --> 01:26:14,145
(Please.)

2358
01:26:14,585 --> 01:26:18,315
(While Team Guys is feeling relaxed without knowing anything...)

2359
01:26:18,585 --> 01:26:19,585
(Nice!)

2360
01:26:19,825 --> 01:26:23,154
(This is the power of the cloak of invisibility.)

2361
01:26:23,155 --> 01:26:25,054
(Everything gets solved with the wish card.)

2362
01:26:25,055 --> 01:26:26,564
(You're an all-rounder today.)

2363
01:26:26,565 --> 01:26:28,364
(Everything gets solved with the wish card.)

2364
01:26:28,365 --> 01:26:32,165
(Team Handsome paces forward silently.)

2365
01:26:33,165 --> 01:26:36,705
(The suspicion grows.)

2366
01:26:37,475 --> 01:26:40,074
(Team Guys will not go down like this.)

2367
01:26:40,075 --> 01:26:42,815
(Team Guys strikes back.)

2368
01:26:43,645 --> 01:26:46,644
(Danger creeps up upon Team Handsome.)

2369
01:26:46,645 --> 01:26:48,245
(Bingo board)

2370
01:26:48,685 --> 01:26:51,315
(The keepers against the stealers)

2371
01:26:51,585 --> 01:26:55,725
(The raid of strength by Team Guys makes things messy.)

2372
01:26:56,025 --> 01:27:00,224
(How will the wild Noodle Road end?)

2373
01:27:00,225 --> 01:27:03,235
