00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:19,299
(You can see the Han River through the concrete jungle.)

2
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,529
(Yeouido Station)

3
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,169
- Hello. - Hello, Sang Uk.

4
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:23,300
(Handsome Guys gathered in Seoul after a long time.)

5
00:00:23,770 --> 00:00:25,970
(Monday, the start of the week, 8am)

6
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:28,700
Dong Hyun looks really scary.

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:29,840
- There he is. - Dong Hyun.

8
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:31,210
- You look very scary today. - Hello.

9
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,639
Are you from "Rustic Period?"

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,739
("Rustic Period?")

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,280
What's wrong with you?

12
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:40,179
(The one who dreams of being an action actor in the 90s)

13
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,180
Here's our director.

14
00:00:41,181 --> 00:00:42,849
- Director, come to the center. - Hello.

15
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:44,149
- Director. - Come to the center.

16
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:45,219
All right.

17
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,220
Hello.

18
00:00:46,221 --> 00:00:47,520
I'll be loyal to you, sir.

19
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,929
Why you...

20
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:50,389
- I'll do my best. - Nice to meet you.

21
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,759
What's with your outfit?

22
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,359
- Are you an intern? - Yes, I am.

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,630
I see.

24
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:55,869
You're the director.

25
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:57,269
This feels very strange.

26
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:59,399
- It's very awkward. - Here's the reason why...

27
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,169
we're dressed like this today.

28
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,740
The staff members contacted each of our stylists.

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,609
- They asked them to dress us... - Like an office worker.

30
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,079
like an office worker.

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,710
- Yes. - Why are you dressed like this?

32
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,779
This is how office workers dress these days.

33
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:14,979
That's old-fashioned.

34
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,620
- Is this old-fashioned? - Yes.

35
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:18,890
- Is that Gen Z's fashion style? - Is this old-fashioned?

36
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,859
- Gen Z's fashion style. - People dress more casually now.

37
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,129
They don't wear ties either.

38
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:24,430
- Really? - We're dressed...

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,200
in a standard way.

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:27,759
That's true.

41
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,429
With a laptop bag.

42
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,700
A laptop bag?

43
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,639
I mean, a briefcase.

44
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,509
There are so many...

45
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:36,569
(So many office workers all over the country)

46
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,170
- office workers. - Yes.

47
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,740
Do you know what their biggest concern is?

48
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:43,850
Wouldn't it be their annual income?

49
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:45,579
- Annual income? - Isn't it annual income?

50
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,580
Annual income while negotiating the contract?

51
00:01:46,581 --> 00:01:47,649
Annual income.

52
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:48,749
- And... - I think...

53
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:50,619
food is the biggest concern for me and Sang Uk.

54
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,619
(Simply and clearly, food)

55
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,990
That's my everyday concern.

56
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,460
- Office workers are concerned... - Is it their lunch?

57
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,559
about what to eat today.

58
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
Right.

59
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:07,300
(In the repetitive everyday life)

60
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,339
(The biggest concern for office workers)

61
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,909
(- Which one would you like to eat? - Anything.)

62
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:12,339
(- Gosh, what shall I eat? - Korean food or Chinese food?)

63
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,079
(And so, what should we eat?)

64
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,509
On behalf of office workers, we'll think about it...

65
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,710
and make recommendations.

66
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:21,850
(What shall we eat for lunch today?)

67
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,890
(Kimchi stew or budae stew?)

68
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:27,890
(Pork cutlet or stir-fried pork?)

69
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,130
(What if you're having a drink after work?)

70
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,060
(Raw fish versus pork belly)

71
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,900
(Pizza with beer versus lamb skewers)

72
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,210
(They eat the dish of their choice.)

73
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:45,440
(They can't eat the dish that they didn't pick.)

74
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,379
(A very realistic...)

75
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:52,010
(food recommendation show)

76
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,890
(Why didn't you pick this?)

77
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,050
(Korean food)

78
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,290
(Chinese food)

79
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,030
Forget about fried dumplings.

80
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,100
(Western food)

81
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,970
It's very flavorful.

82
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,440
(They will go anywhere.)

83
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,710
This is amazing.

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,840
What's this?

85
00:03:16,841 --> 00:03:19,380
(If there's a good dish to recommend)

86
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,780
Rock-paper-scissors.

87
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:23,509
(They put their heart into every meal.)

88
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,580
(5 Handsome Guys...)

89
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,620
- There he goes. - There he goes.

90
00:03:26,621 --> 00:03:28,419
(Too absorbed)

91
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:33,360
(Food recommendation project)

92
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,890
Yeouido. When it comes to Yeouido,

93
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,360
everyone knows it...

94
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:41,299
as a mecca for office workers.

95
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,070
It's where National Assembly Building is located,

96
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:45,000
so it's the center for politics.

97
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,370
That's what people say.

98
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:49,540
To be exact, when I was 20,

99
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,039
I joined KBS in Yeouido.

100
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,069
Wasn't it an open recruitment?

101
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,880
I joined KBS at an open recruitment.

102
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,439
- Then... - It was in 1995.

103
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,009
- In 1995? - I was 20.

104
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:58,309
- What year were you born? - I was born in 1996.

105
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,350
(Oh Sang Uk, born in 1996)

106
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,879
I was born that year.

107
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,819
- He was born in 1995. - Goodness.

108
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,890
They're different.

109
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,760
Look at how he put his arms behind his back.

110
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,420
He looks like a director.

111
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,629
You must know many tasty restaurants in Yeouido.

112
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:12,759
- Aren't there several... - Tae Hyun.

113
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,599
famous tasty restaurants in Yeouido?

114
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,269
You've lived here.

115
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,500
You worked here too.

116
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,570
But it was a very long time ago.

117
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,699
The restaurants are probably gone by now.

118
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,370
Don't ask Tae Hyun about food.

119
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:25,570
He probably doesn't know any tasty restaurants.

120
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,609
(He totally agrees.)

121
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,580
There's a famous bulgogi restaurant here.

122
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,649
- Right, bulgogi... - Bulgogi?

123
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:33,579
I heard that there was a tasty gochujang bulgogi restaurant.

124
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,750
Gochujang bulgogi.

125
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,489
- Do you know any restaurant? - Gochujang bulgogi sounds good.

126
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,989
My favorite Korean dishes are...

127
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,120
gochujang bulgogi and stir-fried pork.

128
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,829
(Lunch without failure)

(Korean set menu with gochujang bulgogi)

130
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:50,099
The weather hasn't warmed up yet.

131
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,199
- Yes. - It's still cold.

132
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,740
I'd love some hot broth.

133
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,400
I enjoy cod soup during winter when it's cold.

134
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,270
- Cod soup? - Cod soup.

135
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,109
I like clear broth.

136
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:00,510
- I like clear broth. - Don't you like clear broth?

137
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,549
(Cod soup with its superb hot broth)

138
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:08,249
(Today's LMR)

139
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,020
(Lunch Menu Recommendation)

140
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,490
Today, we'll have cod soup...

141
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,320
and gochujang bulgogi.

142
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,159
Are we going to eat either...

143
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,289
cod soup or gochujang bulgogi?

144
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,930
Yes, pick 1 of the 2.

145
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,129
Only one?

146
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,160
Yes, only one.

147
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,500
We have to pick only one?

148
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,430
You can't eat both dishes.

149
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,900
Six of us can't eat the same dish.

150
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,640
Why can't we eat two?

151
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,679
- Sang Uk, can you eat two or not? - Two...

152
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,139
I can eat two meals,

153
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,349
and the combination looks good.

154
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,049
People like me and Sang Uk order both at the same time.

155
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:40,320
We order both.

156
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,250
- What's your choice? - Gochujang bulgogi sounds better.

157
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,419
Cod soup isn't enough for a meal.

158
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,789
Right?

159
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,520
When we go to the gochujang bulgogi restaurant,

160
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,629
there will definitely be stew on the side.

161
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,730
That's right.

162
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,629
- You're right. - Gochujang bulgogi.

163
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,929
That's a good idea.

164
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:56,769
- That's true. - I pick gochujang bulgogi.

165
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:57,869
- Gochujang bulgogi. - Gochujang bulgogi.

166
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,970
What about you, Tae Hyun?

167
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,969
I'm going to eat cod soup.

168
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,299
I'm craving cod soup too.

169
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,570
In today's weather,

170
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,410
hot broth will warm the whole body.

171
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,710
- Do you want cod soup? - Yes.

172
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,649
- Let's get going. - Let's go.

173
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,819
We'll go to the cod soup restaurant first.

174
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,849
- Okay. - Let's go.

175
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,319
- Director. - Let's get cod soup.

176
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,719
- Which way is it? - Come this way.

177
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,819
Just follow the director.

178
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,220
- Director, are you treating us? - Cod soup...

179
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,690
It feels new here.

180
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,230
I don't know how it was in the past.

181
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,130
These are LG Twin Towers, Financial Center...

182
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,540
This used to be the SBS building.

183
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,069
This one?

184
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:37,339
It was in this building.

185
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:39,209
- SBS used to be here? - Yes.

186
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,239
(SBS was founded at this place in 1991.)

187
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,810
I don't recognize anything.

188
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,979
(SBS maintained the broadcasting industry...)

189
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,580
(in Yeouido with KBS and MBC for 14 years.)

190
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,719
(Chuckling)

191
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,419
We're moving as a group...

192
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,159
of men in black.

193
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,189
Now that we've walked around,

194
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,359
I think Sang Uk is dressed the most appropriately.

195
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,530
Tae Hyun, this is how office workers dress these days.

196
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,969
(They keep walking without knowing the right office outfit.)

197
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:06,500
- Hello. - Outdoors...

198
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:08,440
- Are you going to work? - Hello.

199
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,409
Do people not dress like this at work?

200
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,779
- No. - No?

201
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,879
Really?

202
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,139
- Are we overdressed? - I was right.

203
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:17,180
- This is old-fashioned. - Goodness.

204
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,879
Do you use "cc" and "bcc" in emails?

205
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:20,880
Yes.

206
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,119
- Really? - I see.

207
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,720
What does "cc" mean?

208
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,660
I have a quiz for you.

209
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,189
- Give it to us. - Really?

210
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,089
- It's related to work terminology. - Work terminology?

211
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:31,090
What's work terminology?

212
00:07:31,091 --> 00:07:32,499
Work terminology is special words...

213
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,930
used by people in the office.

214
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,229
- Mr. Oh Sang Uk. - Yes?

215
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,200
"Cc the team leader on the email."

216
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,400
"Bcc the manager."

217
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,809
- "Bcc?" - All right.

218
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:44,939
(Work terminology 2)

219
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:47,010
- Let's do it lean. - What? Lean?

220
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,940
- "Do it lean?" - "Lean?"

221
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,909
It means to do it effectively.

222
00:07:50,910 --> 00:07:52,150
It must be an English word.

223
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,380
They don't use "thin."

224
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,579
Do they say "lean" instead of "thin?"

225
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,650
"Lean?"

226
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,049
(They check to see if the words are really used.)

227
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:02,559
Cc is when you copy someone on the email.

228
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,959
(Email recipient terminology)

229
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,030
- "Bcc" is actually used. - She knew right away.

230
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:08,060
Be lean today at work.

231
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,169
We don't usually say that.

232
00:08:10,170 --> 00:08:13,470
(We don't usually say that.)

233
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:17,170
Isn't it hard to decide what to eat for lunch every day?

234
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,910
- Yes. - What will you eat today?

235
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,240
Today...

236
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,009
(Thinking)

237
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,849
I'll think about it with my team members.

238
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,949
- Right. - It's a little cold.

239
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:27,349
- It's an everyday concern. - Since it's cold,

240
00:08:27,350 --> 00:08:28,480
shouldn't you get a type of soup?

241
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,189
(While chatting)

242
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,659
Have a good day at work.

243
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,859
- Thank you. - She came this way for us.

244
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,360
- Bye. - She's going that way.

245
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,760
There are so many restaurants.

246
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,730
It's a food court.

247
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,200
Do you see that? It's a food court.

248
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,139
- It must be in here. - There must be many restaurants.

249
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,339
In the basement... Look at the restaurants.

250
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,069
- There are many food options. - I'm hungry.

251
00:08:51,070 --> 00:08:52,370
You have many choices to choose from.

252
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,139
- Welcome. - Here we go.

253
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,549
(Handsome Guys enter the lunch dungeon.)

254
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,349
- Deodeok? - This place on a cold day.

255
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,419
(There's an old-looking restaurant.)

256
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:01,449
I like the name too.

257
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,689
- It's definitely a tasty place. - "After-Party?"

258
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:06,890
(It feels already refreshing from its name.)

259
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,789
There's also braised codfish head on the menu.

260
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:10,290
- I like braised codfish head. - There it is.

261
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:14,159
(In the basement food court,)

262
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,430
(the restaurant opens early in the morning.)

263
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:19,739
(Starting from early in the morning)

264
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:23,670
(A place where Yeouido people satisfy their hunger)

265
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:27,340
(Opened in 1990, it's been around for 36 years.)

266
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,079
(1 of the top 3 cod soup restaurants in Yeouido...)

267
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,380
(where you must wait to get in)

268
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:34,519
(Politicians,)

269
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,849
(broadcasters, and office workers)

270
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:41,620
(The place where Yeouido eaters cure their hangovers)

271
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:48,730
(Rumors say that Choi Bul Am and Lee Yeong Ja frequent here.)

272
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,170
(The broth is light yet rich.)

273
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,510
(The codfish is much thicker and meatier than other places.)

274
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:03,480
(LMR 1, cod soup)

275
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,880
- Braised codfish head? - Can I switch?

276
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:07,650
"Switch?"

277
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,019
- Oh, my. - Hello.

278
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,020
How is it so cheap?

279
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,459
- Those who are eating sit here. - What?

280
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,659
Those who aren't eating sit there.

281
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,690
I mean...

282
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,460
- But... - We can't eat?

283
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,499
Why don't we...

284
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,769
You'll be eating gochujang bulgogi.

285
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,070
Let's buy it ourselves.

286
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,729
- Come on. - Braised codfish head.

287
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:27,369
Some of us can't eat.

288
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:28,499
You only eat what you picked.

289
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,569
- Only the three of us are eating? - Yes.

290
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,469
(Those who will eat cod soup from now on)

291
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:35,639
- So we really can't eat any? - I want cod soup.

292
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,649
I mean, can't we have at least one bite?

293
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,920
- We will see. - "One bite."

294
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,450
"One bite."

295
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,190
It looks like...

296
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,019
a very old restaurant.

297
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,459
(By the way...)

298
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,359
Isn't it too early to eat?

299
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,090
(A customer has been eating even before they arrived.)

300
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,130
- It opens at 6:30am. - It starts at 6:30am.

301
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,099
It actually opens at 6:30am.

302
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:57,170
For people who want to cure their hangover before work.

303
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:58,830
- To eat? - It looks delicious.

304
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,440
There's cod head soup and regular cod soup.

305
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,870
"Cod head soup?"

306
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,010
Cod head? Okay.

307
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,009
There's meat on the head, and it's delicious.

308
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,249
Meat on the fish head is known to be the best.

309
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,350
(A special fish head dish only at this restaurant)

310
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:15,049
Can you hurry up and order?

311
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,290
We haven't eaten yet.

312
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,819
- We have to go... - Why are you being sensitive?

313
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,689
and eat gochujang bulgogi.

314
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,319
I'll get cod soup.

315
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,389
- The head or the body? - I'll get the body.

316
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:25,429
I don't want the head either.

317
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:26,759
Shall we order one braised codfish head?

318
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,199
Yes, a small one.

319
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,029
We definitely need to order braised codfish head.

320
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,270
We need to order that too?

321
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,999
It's impossible not to.

322
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,870
It's so early in the morning, but okay.

323
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,539
- Excuse me, ma'am. - Yes?

324
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:41,080
One cod head soup, two cod soup,

325
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:43,249
and a small braised codfish head, please.

326
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,309
Would you like braised codfish head?

327
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,220
- Yes. - Yes, one small please.

328
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,920
She checked to make sure...

329
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,690
that we wanted it in the morning.

330
00:11:50,190 --> 00:11:53,259
- I'm so hungry. - How spicy would you like?

331
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,359
The braised codfish head?

332
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,189
- Please don't make it too spicy. - Not spicy.

333
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,529
Why are you deciding?

334
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,729
Please make it not spicy.

335
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,730
(He's unbelievable.)

336
00:11:59,731 --> 00:12:01,329
We will take care of it.

337
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,629
You won't be eating it anyway.

338
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,900
Who knows?

339
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,899
Sir, I'm sorry to bother you while you're having breakfast.

340
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:09,069
No, it's okay. This is a good restaurant.

341
00:12:09,070 --> 00:12:10,969
Really? Do you frequent here?

342
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,339
I've been coming here for 30 years.

343
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,679
(Shocked)

344
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,579
Seriously? He's been coming here since it opened.

345
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,049
Are you eating before going to work?

346
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,050
I'm eating on my way to work.

347
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,120
I've been coming here since my second year at work.

348
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,890
It's been about 26 years.

349
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:27,919
(Unbelievable)

350
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,630
May I ask what your position is now?

351
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:32,630
I'm a director.

352
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,500
He's a director.

353
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,400
Sir, how do you usually choose what to eat for lunch?

354
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,070
Lunch?

355
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:42,640
I usually eat what my juniors like.

356
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,740
- That's the best choice. - Aren't there many?

357
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,739
Thank you. Have a good day at work today.

358
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,879
(We thank the director for his wise answer.)

359
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,110
- Again today, - Have a good day.

360
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,219
be cautious around your junior colleagues.

361
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,350
I know.

362
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,220
- I know. - Goodbye.

363
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:58,949
- Have a good day. - Don't pay for your meal.

364
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:00,020
- No. - Don't.

365
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,789
(Don't pay for your meal.)

366
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:03,829
- No. - It will be on us today.

367
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,059
I should treat you all instead.

368
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,960
- No. - No way.

369
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,229
Enjoy your meal.

370
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,170
- Thank you. Goodbye. - Have a good day.

371
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,900
He's like a typical director.

372
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,299
"I'll treat you all."

373
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,899
- I should've asked about "lean." - Right.

374
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,569
- He would have known. - By the way...

375
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:18,639
By the way...

376
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,180
- Look at the braised codfish head. - Goodness.

377
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:23,149
- That's supposed to be small? - Small? I'm so excited.

378
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,880
- It looks like braised monkfish. - This is great.

379
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,519
My scarf...

380
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,120
(Intern Oh gets ready in a hurry to eat.)

381
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:32,549
(He removes everything that could interfere with eating.)

382
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,919
It's called LMR.

383
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,129
(A generous portion of braised codfish head arrives.)

384
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,460
LMR.

385
00:13:40,230 --> 00:13:42,129
(Happy)

386
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,200
This is it.

387
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,570
(Braised codfish head, a special dish for lunch)

388
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:54,580
(The red look warms up the salivary glands.)

389
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,909
- Thank you. - I'm glad that we ordered it.

390
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,050
This is very...

391
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,379
I'm a huge fan of braised monkfish.

392
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:02,020
Why are you taking off your jacket?

393
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,819
What? Just because...

394
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:05,289
- Mr. Shin. - I feel uncomfortable.

395
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:06,559
Mr. Shin, why are you taking off your jacket?

396
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,819
Can we get a separate plate?

397
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,060
No, we don't need it.

398
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,289
- Separate plate? - Can we get two plates?

399
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,530
(He tries again quietly.)

400
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,700
- Just watch us for now. - It's a real tasty restaurant.

401
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,629
I can tell without eating.

402
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,029
- You know why? - How do you know?

403
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,230
The sauce is...

404
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,700
This place has 30 years of history.

405
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,009
- It looks different. - The sauce is...

406
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,670
(Seung Ho gets up quietly.)

407
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:28,540
Gosh, Mr. Shin is...

408
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,550
He's bringing chopsticks.

409
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,849
Here you go.

410
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:35,820
(Giving them first to the director)

411
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,319
(Pleased)

412
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,190
Mr. Shin knows how to behave well at work.

413
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,190
Thank you.

414
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,489
- Gosh, this is... - Cod soup is here.

415
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:46,799
It looks like...

416
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,100
This is insane.

417
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,359
My goodness.

418
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,700
- That's the cod head soup. - Thank you.

419
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,339
- The bowl shows that it's good. - Right.

420
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,340
- It's this type of bowl. - Right.

421
00:14:54,341 --> 00:14:55,570
(The bowl shows that the cod soup is good.)

422
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,109
They have 30 years of history.

423
00:14:57,110 --> 00:14:59,840
(Refreshing broth with 36 years of history)

424
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:02,980
(A huge chunk of cod)

425
00:15:03,710 --> 00:15:07,280
(Refreshing cod soup)

426
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,849
(The first LMR we've been waiting for, a meal of cod soup)

427
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:14,019
- Thank you. - Gosh.

428
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,020
(It looks insanely good.)

429
00:15:15,021 --> 00:15:16,259
It smells delicious.

430
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,230
I'll cancel the gochujang bulgogi.

431
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,799
I want to eat now.

432
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,099
(I want to eat now.)

433
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,229
Wait a minute.

434
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,499
Thank you for the food.

435
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,370
- Enjoy your food. - Thank you for the food.

436
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,570
(Tae Hyun tastes the broth first.)

437
00:15:27,571 --> 00:15:29,870
- The broth is... - This is...

438
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,569
(A rare reaction from the director)

439
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,709
It's really refreshing.

440
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:36,010
The seasoning isn't overpowering.

441
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:39,279
(Yi Kyung also starts with some broth.)

442
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,450
Other restaurants serve...

443
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:44,119
- a small piece of cod in the soup. - Be quiet.

444
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,749
(However, at this place)

445
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:46,959
- Is this really cod? - Dong Hyun.

446
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,420
It's as big as an anaconda.

447
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:50,159
It's this big.

448
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,590
(The cod is as big as an anaconda.)

449
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,160
(Exhaling)

450
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,999
(The broth is beyond words.)

451
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,230
It's an anaconda.

452
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,240
(You get both cod fish and the broth in one dish.)

453
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,539
Gosh, the broth...

454
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,210
(Gosh, the broth)

455
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,949
(He feels quite left out, which was unexpected.)

456
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:15,120
- This is really refreshing. - Gosh, the broth.

457
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,889
(Tae Hyun seems to enjoy it much more than usual.)

458
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,460
It's really good.

459
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,659
(Sang Uk takes over the braised codfish head.)

460
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:26,090
Seriously, I'm about to get angry.

461
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,459
Look at this.

462
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,670
- Gosh, this is insane. - Thank you.

463
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,500
Leave it.

464
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,769
I'm showing it to him so that he can enjoy it more.

465
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,540
The bean sprouts also look delicious.

466
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,539
The bite I'm grabbing now looks so good.

467
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:41,580
What did I tell you?

468
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,880
Gochujang bulgogi is excellent,

469
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:45,909
but when it's cold...

470
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,520
(Dong Hyun, I'll eat it exactly like that.)

471
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,049
Hot broth is the best.

472
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,360
Enjoy your food.

473
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,060
(Moved by the braised codfish head)

474
00:16:58,190 --> 00:17:00,259
I don't want to fight with anyone,

475
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:02,600
but I just want to try some.

476
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,500
Just wait.

477
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,040
- It's clearly a tasty restaurant. - Gosh.

478
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,110
(After seeing them in awe, Yi Kyung also takes a bite.)

479
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,509
The braised codfish head is amazing.

480
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,109
I'm glad that you ordered it.

481
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,210
- I agree. - Seriously.

482
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,180
The meat comes off so easily.

483
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,020
The codfish is...

484
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,620
very chewy.

485
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,560
Are you okay?

486
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,960
Can I try some?

487
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,989
(Chewy cod meat...)

488
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,529
(and crunchy bean sprouts)

489
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:37,830
(They make the best texture combination ever.)

490
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,499
(He takes a huge and compact bite of it.)

491
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:42,070
Did you know that you can ask for broth refill...

492
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,469
as much as you want?

493
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:44,869
(They hear good news while eating.)

494
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,139
- Really? - Yes.

495
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,239
Seriously?

496
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,580
This place is very cost-effective.

497
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:50,909
- Isn't it insane? - Yes.

498
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:53,150
Also, it's less than ten dollars.

499
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,479
May I get some broth?

500
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,850
- No way. - I can't ask for a refill, can I?

501
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,190
Then how about this?

502
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,989
Make an acrostic poem with Cha Tae Hyun.

503
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,060
"Cha Tae Hyun?"

504
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,189
Cha...

505
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,530
(Goodness)

506
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,959
Director Cha.

507
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,099
(Cha: Director Cha)

508
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,260
Tae.

509
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,869
Tae...

510
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:13,340
(He faces a crisis after one syllable.)

511
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,639
- You're out. - Tae...

512
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,169
Forget it. You don't deserve it.

513
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,740
- Seung Ho, are you ready? - Tae...

514
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,580
- I'll try. - Cha.

515
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,540
President Cha Tae Hyun.

516
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,049
- "President?" - I became a president.

517
00:18:24,050 --> 00:18:25,749
- You got promoted right away. - I became a president.

518
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,980
- He became a president. - Tae.

519
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:28,779
President who's like the sun.

520
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:30,750
President who's like the sun. Hyun.

521
00:18:31,550 --> 00:18:33,519
Please make wise judgment.

522
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,759
(Hyun: Please make wise judgment.)

523
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,829
(He nailed it.)

524
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,030
- Tae Hyun, serve him food. - Yes.

525
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,100
You did a good job.

526
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,370
- "Wise judgment." - It was wise.

527
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,399
The seasoning is amazing.

528
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,370
- My rice is clean. - Yes.

529
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,939
The seasoning is amazing.

530
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:52,169
(He finally gets to try what he could only look at.)

531
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:53,310
Gosh, wait.

532
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:56,040
- This is all I could think about. - Nice.

533
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,779
Did you come up with one?

534
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,309
Wait, acrostic poems are difficult.

535
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,649
- Did you come up with one? - Did you?

536
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:02,219
- Oh. - What do you mean "Oh?"

537
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,549
For Oh Sang Uk.

538
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,350
(Seung Ho finally gets to try it.)

539
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,190
(Grunting with joy)

540
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,590
(A smile returns to Seung Ho's face.)

541
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,900
(Slurping bean sprouts)

542
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:20,340
(As a bonus, he gets to try some broth.)

543
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,009
Gosh, I'm hungry.

544
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,380
Seung Ho, what do you think of the broth?

545
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,580
I hardly drink alcohol.

546
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:34,350
When I tried the broth,

547
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,919
I thought, "Did I drink last night?"

548
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,790
- Some broths make me think so. - Right.

549
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,789
- It feels good on the stomach? - It's very refreshing.

550
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:43,259
Since Dong Hyun doesn't drink alcohol,

551
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,929
he won't need to eat it.

552
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:46,659
It could help if I eat some.

553
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,560
I've drunk in the past.

554
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:51,530
I still have a hangover from it.

555
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,439
Which one do you want to eat more?

556
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,340
Cod soup or braised codfish head?

557
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,509
- I want to pull the meat off. - That one?

558
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,309
(I want to tear off some codfish head.)

559
00:19:59,310 --> 00:20:00,740
(Imagining himself devouring it)

560
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,539
(The simulation is perfect.)

561
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,210
Some of this meat...

562
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,250
(Thinking about an acrostic poem)

563
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,949
My head isn't working. I can't think of any acrostic poem.

564
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,489
(The problem is that he can't come up with a poem.)

565
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:13,489
Dong Hyun, play the number game with me.

566
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:15,019
You'll lose if you say 31.

567
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:17,629
- This is easy. - You like this game, don't you?

568
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,389
I am good at being strategic.

569
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:21,629
- You have always been strategic. - Right.

570
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,399
Would you like to start? Or shall I go?

571
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,969
- One, two, three. - Four, five, six.

572
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:26,469
- Seven, eight, nine. - Ten, eleven, twelve.

573
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:28,300
- Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. - Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.

574
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:30,009
(They get to the 20s quickly.)

575
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,139
Twenty-two.

576
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:32,609
(He's starting to think.)

577
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,709
Twenty-three.

578
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:35,410
(Relaxed)

579
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:40,349
(Remaining numbers are 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.)

580
00:20:40,350 --> 00:20:41,649
(What?)

581
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,620
(Dong Hyun is knocked out.)

582
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,219
Gosh, he's an expert.

583
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,389
(Chuckling)

584
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:48,920
- He's an expert. - I'm not. I just played.

585
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,789
(He attacks again with 1, 2, 3.)

586
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:52,359
- Seven, eight, nine. - Ten, eleven, twelve.

587
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,629
Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen.

588
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:54,729
Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen.

589
00:20:54,730 --> 00:20:56,300
- Nineteen, twenty, twenty-one. - Twenty-two.

590
00:20:57,030 --> 00:20:58,069
Twenty-three.

591
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:59,170
Twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six.

592
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,339
(Remaining numbers are 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 again.)

593
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,039
- Twenty-seven. - Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.

594
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:09,340
(They repeat without an error.)

595
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,810
How does this happen?

596
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,320
Do you lose when you go first?

597
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:15,479
Should I not go first? You go first, Yi Kyung.

598
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,219
- One. - Two, three, four.

599
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,919
- Five. - You should've said 1, 2, 3.

600
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,920
(You should've started with 1, 2, 3 like me.)

601
00:21:19,921 --> 00:21:21,489
- Okay, 1, 2, 3. - Four, five, six.

602
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,119
- Seven, eight, nine. - Ten, eleven, twelve.

603
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,059
- Thirteen. - Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen.

604
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,330
Seventeen, eighteen.

605
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,659
Nineteen, twenty-one... Twenty.

606
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,269
- What? - I made a mistake.

607
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,469
- Twenty. - Twenty?

608
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:33,600
Twenty-one, twenty-two.

609
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,539
Twenty-three, twenty-four.

610
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,669
(Being careful)

611
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:37,910
Twenty-five, twenty-six.

612
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,679
(Remaining numbers are 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 again.)

613
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,940
Did you say 26 and 9?

614
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,509
- What's 26 and 9? - Twenty-seven.

615
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,679
Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty.

616
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,850
(He fell for it again.)

617
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,349
I lose no matter what.

618
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,579
(He never ended up showing his tactics.)

619
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,189
It's impossible for you to win.

620
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,689
How about a round of rock-paper-scissors...

621
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:55,189
with Sang Uk?

622
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,630
- I have a high winning rate. - Accept it if you lose this time.

623
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,859
We want to give you food too.

624
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:01,000
- I'll win rock-paper-scissors. - We want you to eat too.

625
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,499
Can I be strategic?

626
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,630
Of course.

627
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:04,869
I'll be ready.

628
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:06,200
I'll start here.

629
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,170
- I'll lower it like this. - Okay.

630
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:11,109
I'll lower it without changing the sign.

631
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,379
From here like this. I'm serious.

632
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,010
- Like this without changing. - Like that?

633
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:16,979
Ready or not,

634
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,679
rock-paper-scissors.

635
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,119
(Rock, paper)

636
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,079
(He finally won!)

637
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,490
He's very simple.

638
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,690
He played rock after seeing scissors.

639
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,359
- Eat all of it. - I've been brainwashed.

640
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,559
- He finally gets to eat it. - That's how he won.

641
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,130
- That was great. - The meat is very delicious.

642
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,100
It's very delicious.

643
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,670
(Slurping the broth first)

644
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,269
- Isn't it clean? - Isn't it good?

645
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,439
It's very rich.

646
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,770
Don't you like the broth?

647
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,969
It's very rich.

648
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,009
(We're glad that he gets to eat it.)

649
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,410
It's definitely a restaurant with 30 years of history.

650
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:53,850
(He also takes a bite of the braised codfish head.)

651
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,419
Are you done eating?

652
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:56,650
- Yes. - Yes.

653
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,490
Can you put your personal card on the table?

654
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,959
Why?

655
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,160
My card is...

656
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,259
One of the cards might be picked.

657
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,530
(It has nothing to do with me.)

658
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,859
- Theirs too? They didn't eat. - We didn't even eat.

659
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,929
- Still put it on the table. - You ate.

660
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:14,269
- What? - You had some.

661
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:16,940
- You had the biggest piece. - You ate.

662
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:18,270
Don't you have your card on you?

663
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,610
I have mine.

664
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:22,462
If you have it, please put it on the table.

665
00:23:22,962 --> 00:23:26,532
(Both teams turn in their cards.)

666
00:23:26,702 --> 00:23:28,141
Now that you ate,

667
00:23:28,142 --> 00:23:30,572
- you need to pay for the food. - Right.

668
00:23:30,612 --> 00:23:32,771
It includes the director's bill.

669
00:23:32,772 --> 00:23:35,212
- There's also the director's. - Right.

670
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:39,412
Now, I'll give you a quiz...

671
00:23:39,982 --> 00:23:41,481
that you like.

672
00:23:41,482 --> 00:23:43,081
(Time for quiz to determine who pays the bill)

673
00:23:43,082 --> 00:23:44,351
This quiz will be done...

674
00:23:44,352 --> 00:23:48,122
- by those who ate the cod soup. - Okay.

675
00:23:48,162 --> 00:23:50,432
If you get it wrong,

676
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:52,891
you will pay the bill.

677
00:23:52,892 --> 00:23:55,802
If you three get it correctly,

678
00:23:55,962 --> 00:23:58,631
those who didn't pick cod soup will pay for you.

679
00:23:58,632 --> 00:24:00,272
- Is it 3 against 2? - I see.

680
00:24:00,302 --> 00:24:02,371
- Our members are amazing. - So the other team will...

681
00:24:02,372 --> 00:24:03,841
pay for us?

682
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:05,041
Do you agree with this?

683
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:07,481
I don't know. I already ate,

684
00:24:07,482 --> 00:24:09,312
so I'm willing to pay for it.

685
00:24:10,042 --> 00:24:11,111
Did you enjoy the food?

686
00:24:11,112 --> 00:24:13,012
- I haven't eaten enough. - I'm not angry anymore.

687
00:24:13,522 --> 00:24:15,482
(Laughing)

688
00:24:15,582 --> 00:24:18,622
Here's the quiz for the three who picked cod soup.

689
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,092
Codfish has a special trait...

690
00:24:21,592 --> 00:24:23,961
where it gropes the bottom...

691
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:26,392
with its beard to find prey.

692
00:24:27,202 --> 00:24:29,601
Pick what's not a special trait...

693
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,271
of the fish of the following.

694
00:24:31,272 --> 00:24:32,331
It's a multiple-choice question.

695
00:24:32,332 --> 00:24:34,102
One, herrings communicate...

696
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:36,701
with its farting sound.

697
00:24:36,702 --> 00:24:38,271
(1. Herrings communicate with their farting sound.)

698
00:24:38,272 --> 00:24:39,412
- Two. - That's right.

699
00:24:40,482 --> 00:24:43,751
Squids change the size of their body...

700
00:24:43,752 --> 00:24:45,181
to express their feelings.

701
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:46,212
That's correct too.

702
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:48,922
I've heard them before.

703
00:24:48,952 --> 00:24:50,652
Three, sharks search prey...

704
00:24:50,792 --> 00:24:53,191
through the electric field.

705
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:54,622
That's correct too.

706
00:24:54,762 --> 00:24:56,622
One of them is false.

707
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:58,631
We have to pick what's false.

708
00:24:58,632 --> 00:25:00,131
- I think it's the squid. - The squid?

709
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,862
Right, they express themselves with ink.

710
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:03,771
They use ink.

711
00:25:03,772 --> 00:25:05,331
- By changing their size... - When you look at them closely,

712
00:25:05,332 --> 00:25:07,142
they wiggle.

713
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:09,902
Aren't sharks attracted by the smell of blood?

714
00:25:10,242 --> 00:25:11,372
It's the smell of blood.

715
00:25:11,942 --> 00:25:14,081
Do they only eat fish that are bleeding?

716
00:25:14,082 --> 00:25:16,082
- That's true. - Isn't that strange?

717
00:25:16,952 --> 00:25:18,251
Herrings fart?

718
00:25:18,252 --> 00:25:20,382
- Do fish fart? - They communicate by farting.

719
00:25:20,922 --> 00:25:22,282
We don't have the knowledge anyway.

720
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:24,322
I think it's number two.

721
00:25:24,952 --> 00:25:26,291
- Express their feelings? - Don't show them.

722
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:27,721
I mean, don't make it obvious.

723
00:25:27,722 --> 00:25:29,861
It's because squids...

724
00:25:29,862 --> 00:25:31,861
Let's pick the answer through elimination.

725
00:25:31,862 --> 00:25:32,892
Okay.

726
00:25:33,962 --> 00:25:35,261
(1. Herrings communicate with their farting sound.)

727
00:25:35,262 --> 00:25:37,031
- They communicate by farting? - Farting?

728
00:25:37,032 --> 00:25:39,171
Communicating by farting means...

729
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:40,971
(Trying to keep a poker face)

730
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:42,671
It sounds ridiculous,

731
00:25:42,672 --> 00:25:45,471
but don't you think it's a choice because it's true?

732
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,942
- I agree. - Farting.

733
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,341
Should I cross this out?

734
00:25:48,342 --> 00:25:49,812
- Cross it out. - Okay.

735
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,182
Then...

736
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,212
it's either sharks using the electric field...

737
00:25:53,622 --> 00:25:56,021
or squids expressing feelings by changing their size.

738
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,752
Do sharks use electricity...

739
00:25:58,352 --> 00:26:00,692
In documentaries about sharks,

740
00:26:01,392 --> 00:26:03,321
weren't they attracted...

741
00:26:03,322 --> 00:26:05,431
by blood in the water?

742
00:26:05,432 --> 00:26:06,932
Yes, that's true.

743
00:26:07,262 --> 00:26:08,431
They have to detect prey...

744
00:26:08,432 --> 00:26:09,831
before the presence of blood.

745
00:26:09,832 --> 00:26:11,672
- There must be something before. - Really?

746
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:14,771
(Quietly)

747
00:26:14,772 --> 00:26:16,172
- Psychologically, - Really?

748
00:26:16,272 --> 00:26:18,211
would they be duped if we say number two is right?

749
00:26:18,212 --> 00:26:20,212
- Or number 3? - I think number 2...

750
00:26:20,342 --> 00:26:21,342
After a good meal...

751
00:26:21,343 --> 00:26:22,781
When it's touched,

752
00:26:22,782 --> 00:26:24,651
it wouldn't burst because of stress.

753
00:26:24,652 --> 00:26:25,681
(Whispering)

754
00:26:25,682 --> 00:26:28,081
I also think number two is the answer.

755
00:26:28,082 --> 00:26:30,291
- Wouldn't they use colors? - Right?

756
00:26:30,292 --> 00:26:31,522
They might use colors.

757
00:26:32,022 --> 00:26:34,221
I haven't seen squids...

758
00:26:34,222 --> 00:26:36,062
changing their body size.

759
00:26:36,622 --> 00:26:38,191
They don't get bigger all of a sudden.

760
00:26:38,192 --> 00:26:40,662
- They don't do that under stress. - I don't think so either.

761
00:26:41,002 --> 00:26:43,002
- Don't laugh. - Let's go with it.

762
00:26:43,432 --> 00:26:44,902
- Do you know the answer? - Of course.

763
00:26:45,002 --> 00:26:46,632
They looked it up.

764
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:48,042
I'll give you a chance to switch.

765
00:26:48,602 --> 00:26:50,512
Don't get into a psychological war with Dong Hyun.

766
00:26:51,742 --> 00:26:53,612
He's been fighting psychological wars for 30 years.

767
00:26:54,082 --> 00:26:55,682
- Let's go. - Number two.

768
00:26:56,112 --> 00:26:57,681
- The answer is number 2. - Number 2.

769
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:58,712
Number two?

770
00:26:59,012 --> 00:27:01,222
- That's correct. - Okay.

771
00:27:01,682 --> 00:27:03,521
(Keeping a poker face)

772
00:27:03,522 --> 00:27:06,421
(They fail to confuse them.)

773
00:27:06,422 --> 00:27:07,992
How did you guess correctly?

774
00:27:08,192 --> 00:27:09,691
I was very jealous of you...

775
00:27:09,692 --> 00:27:11,491
- because I knew the answer. - Really?

776
00:27:11,492 --> 00:27:12,492
Really?

777
00:27:12,493 --> 00:27:14,931
Usually, squids express their feelings with colors.

778
00:27:14,932 --> 00:27:15,932
Right.

779
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:17,471
- They don't use their body size. - What is it?

780
00:27:17,472 --> 00:27:19,831
They have chromatophores.

781
00:27:19,832 --> 00:27:20,941
- What do squids use? - There are dots.

782
00:27:20,942 --> 00:27:22,101
As Sang Uk said,

783
00:27:22,102 --> 00:27:24,511
squids change colors...

784
00:27:24,512 --> 00:27:26,271
of their chromatophores.

785
00:27:26,272 --> 00:27:27,381
That's how they express their feelings.

786
00:27:27,382 --> 00:27:28,581
(Squids use chromatophores to change the body color...)

787
00:27:28,582 --> 00:27:29,742
(to express their feelings.)

788
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:31,611
Shall we decide by playing mukjjibba?

789
00:27:31,612 --> 00:27:32,811
One round of mukjjibba?

790
00:27:32,812 --> 00:27:33,851
Mukjjibba?

791
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,021
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

792
00:27:35,022 --> 00:27:36,652
- One round of rock-paper-scissors? - You'll win by doing this.

793
00:27:36,852 --> 00:27:38,091
- One round of rock-paper-scissors? - When you play this,

794
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:39,492
- you will pay. - Okay.

795
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,921
Shall we go right away?

796
00:27:41,922 --> 00:27:43,121
Look.

797
00:27:43,122 --> 00:27:44,491
You'll win by doing this.

798
00:27:44,492 --> 00:27:46,291
- Ready or not... - I'll pay the bill.

799
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:47,831
- Ready or not, - Like this.

800
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,032
- My hand is frozen. - rock-paper-scissors.

801
00:27:49,202 --> 00:27:50,232
Gosh.

802
00:27:51,132 --> 00:27:53,672
Come on. I need time to think...

803
00:27:53,802 --> 00:27:54,802
Wait, okay.

804
00:27:54,803 --> 00:27:55,841
I'll play scissors this time.

805
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,511
Wait, can I ask one thing?

806
00:27:57,512 --> 00:27:58,971
- I'll play this. - Dong Hyun plays...

807
00:27:58,972 --> 00:28:00,441
after looking at my sign.

808
00:28:00,442 --> 00:28:01,442
I do?

809
00:28:01,443 --> 00:28:02,711
- You do. - Do I have...

810
00:28:02,712 --> 00:28:05,252
- such a skill... - He sees the opponent's attack.

811
00:28:05,412 --> 00:28:06,811
- I won't look. - We won't look.

812
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:07,881
Let's turn around.

813
00:28:07,882 --> 00:28:08,921
- Look. - It's funny to watch them fight...

814
00:28:08,922 --> 00:28:09,922
- in suits. - Turn around.

815
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:11,222
My hand is frozen, so I can't change it.

816
00:28:11,892 --> 00:28:13,121
- I'll play this no matter what. - Don't look.

817
00:28:13,122 --> 00:28:14,361
Turn around.

818
00:28:14,362 --> 00:28:15,561
- I'll play this. - Turn around.

819
00:28:15,562 --> 00:28:16,562
Okay.
My goodness.

820
00:28:17,563 --> 00:28:19,191
Ready or not,

821
00:28:19,192 --> 00:28:20,402
rock-paper-scissors.

822
00:28:21,502 --> 00:28:23,431
(This is how to be strategic.)

823
00:28:23,432 --> 00:28:24,872
(Untainted)

824
00:28:25,732 --> 00:28:28,002
(Did I lose?)

825
00:28:28,372 --> 00:28:31,741
(Joy and sorrow of the liar and the fooled)

826
00:28:31,742 --> 00:28:33,042
Thank you for the food, Dong Hyun.

827
00:28:33,642 --> 00:28:34,642
Thank you.

828
00:28:34,643 --> 00:28:35,711
- Thank you. - Goodness.

829
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,841
(Always be careful not to be stabbed in the back)

830
00:28:36,842 --> 00:28:38,852
- Goodness. - Gosh.

831
00:28:39,082 --> 00:28:40,482
I only had one piece.

832
00:28:40,682 --> 00:28:42,751
- He'll pay 70 dollars. - Have a good day.

833
00:28:42,752 --> 00:28:43,851
Thank you. It was delicious.

834
00:28:43,852 --> 00:28:45,622
The food was very cheap.

835
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,091
(Total: 61 dollars)

836
00:28:49,092 --> 00:28:51,292
- Here it is. - Can I see the receipt?

837
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:52,832
Thank you, Dong Hyun.

838
00:28:52,962 --> 00:28:54,501
Please make good lunch for office workers.

839
00:28:54,502 --> 00:28:55,932
- Thank you. - Thank you.

840
00:28:56,432 --> 00:28:57,932
That was great.

841
00:28:59,472 --> 00:29:01,442
Let's go and get gochujang bulgogi right away.

842
00:29:03,972 --> 00:29:07,041
I don't know if Dong Hyun is good...

843
00:29:07,042 --> 00:29:08,612
at fighting psychological wars.

844
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:10,812
Actually, there was no psychological war.

845
00:29:11,052 --> 00:29:13,651
There are things that we need to go over.

846
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:14,851
Without going over them,

847
00:29:14,852 --> 00:29:16,981
I won't be able to let go.

848
00:29:16,982 --> 00:29:18,752
It was really miserable a moment ago.

849
00:29:19,552 --> 00:29:20,791
It was really miserable.

850
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:21,921
(Being brutally honest)

851
00:29:21,922 --> 00:29:23,521
After having a good meal with Seung Ho,

852
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:24,961
you played a game against him.

853
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:26,032
- Dong Hyun. - Yes?

854
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:28,702
I'll win our gochujang bulgogi.

855
00:29:28,962 --> 00:29:30,601
- I'll get the quiz right. - If you do, I'll forgive you.

856
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:31,801
- Don't worry. - If you lose,

857
00:29:31,802 --> 00:29:33,432
you have to play scissors, okay?

858
00:29:34,302 --> 00:29:36,601
I'll play rock, so you have to play scissors.

859
00:29:36,602 --> 00:29:38,672
- Let's write it before we play. - Okay.

860
00:29:39,012 --> 00:29:40,942
Write it before you play?

861
00:29:41,782 --> 00:29:43,641
Many company dinners take place here.

862
00:29:43,642 --> 00:29:44,782
That's right.

863
00:29:45,312 --> 00:29:46,351
Gosh, this place...

864
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:48,222
Noodles, rice, and coffee.

865
00:29:48,582 --> 00:29:49,821
- This is the real deal. - Stir-fried squid...

866
00:29:49,822 --> 00:29:50,851
This is the place.

867
00:29:50,852 --> 00:29:51,891
Here it is.

868
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:53,791
The food has to be delicious here.

869
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,792
(It's my dish this time.)

870
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,092
- This is amazing. - Hello.

871
00:29:56,262 --> 00:29:57,831
- Hello. - Welcome.

872
00:29:57,832 --> 00:30:00,361
- This is the place where we eat. - Here it is.

873
00:30:00,362 --> 00:30:02,532
(A small restaurant that doesn't look special)

874
00:30:02,962 --> 00:30:07,772
(A lot of hustle and bustle at lunch every day)

875
00:30:08,902 --> 00:30:18,352
(There's a wait because it's small.)

876
00:30:18,682 --> 00:30:27,762
(People come here constantly.)

877
00:30:28,162 --> 00:30:32,131
(For the last 30 years)

878
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:36,662
(Loved by office workers in Yeouido)

879
00:30:37,472 --> 00:30:46,071
(LMR 2, gochujang bulgogi)

880
00:30:46,072 --> 00:30:49,011
- Hello. - Hello.

881
00:30:49,012 --> 00:30:50,111
I haven't eaten yet.

882
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:53,112
- Gochujang bulgogi... - Can we get two orders?

883
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:54,821
(Can we get two orders?)

884
00:30:54,822 --> 00:30:56,351
Are you getting two orders?

885
00:30:56,352 --> 00:30:57,522
- Two orders. - No, Dong Hyun.

886
00:30:58,322 --> 00:30:59,322
(His urgent hand)

887
00:30:59,323 --> 00:31:00,352
Wait.

888
00:31:01,122 --> 00:31:02,161
This place is also...

889
00:31:02,162 --> 00:31:03,162
- The prices are incredible. - By the way...

890
00:31:03,163 --> 00:31:04,531
The prices are good.

891
00:31:04,532 --> 00:31:06,161
- You should get a stew. - We need a stew.

892
00:31:06,162 --> 00:31:07,461
Do we have to order stew separately?

893
00:31:07,462 --> 00:31:08,601
Stew is served...

894
00:31:08,602 --> 00:31:09,931
- with gochujang bulgogi. - What?

895
00:31:09,932 --> 00:31:10,971
- Is it gochujang stew? - Yes.

896
00:31:10,972 --> 00:31:12,471
- Gochujang stew? - Gochujang bulgogi and stew...

897
00:31:12,472 --> 00:31:14,701
Gochujang bulgogi is served with soft tofu stew.

898
00:31:14,702 --> 00:31:15,741
My goodness.

899
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:16,872
And it's only ten dollars?

900
00:31:17,072 --> 00:31:18,911
- Can it be doenjang stew? - No.

901
00:31:18,912 --> 00:31:20,211
Do you want doenjang stew?

902
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,212
How about this?
(2 gochujang bulgogi, 1 doenjang stew)

903
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:24,011
- Let's get a rolled omelet. - Go ahead.

904
00:31:24,012 --> 00:31:25,212
- Okay. - Rolled omelet.

905
00:31:25,312 --> 00:31:26,911
Shall we order three gochujang bulgogi?

906
00:31:26,912 --> 00:31:28,121
- Let's get 3. - Let's get 3.

907
00:31:28,122 --> 00:31:29,352
Three gochujang bulgogi.

908
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:31,452
And one doenjang stew.

909
00:31:31,552 --> 00:31:33,521
- Definitely. - One rolled omelet.

910
00:31:33,522 --> 00:31:35,061
- That's enough. - Definitely.

911
00:31:35,062 --> 00:31:36,662
Only two people are eating.

912
00:31:36,792 --> 00:31:38,131
- Definitely. - What's wrong with that?

913
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:40,031
Your order is enough for six people.

914
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,432
Gosh, I'm hungry.

915
00:31:41,962 --> 00:31:43,901
Gosh, our intern.

916
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,331
The youngest is doing it again on his own.

917
00:31:46,332 --> 00:31:47,542
My goodness.

918
00:31:47,842 --> 00:31:49,841
- When did you join the company? - Enjoy your food.

919
00:31:49,842 --> 00:31:51,711
I joined two days ago.

920
00:31:51,712 --> 00:31:52,772
- Intern Oh. - Yes?

921
00:31:52,872 --> 00:31:54,381
Give us spoons and chopsticks.

922
00:31:54,382 --> 00:31:55,781
- Yes, sir. - What are you doing?

923
00:31:55,782 --> 00:31:56,811
I'm sorry.

924
00:31:56,812 --> 00:31:59,082
(Automatic)

925
00:31:59,282 --> 00:32:00,881
- At the same time... - Whom shall I serve?

926
00:32:00,882 --> 00:32:02,081
- These 2. - These 2?

927
00:32:02,082 --> 00:32:03,651
Please put the food only on this side.

928
00:32:03,652 --> 00:32:04,991
Put them in a row on this side...

929
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:06,251
like a railway.

930
00:32:06,252 --> 00:32:07,361
Like a railway?

931
00:32:07,362 --> 00:32:09,121
Only on this side, please.

932
00:32:09,122 --> 00:32:10,122
Okay.

933
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:12,462
Dong Hyun, this is...

934
00:32:12,662 --> 00:32:14,032
- Exactly. - This is...

935
00:32:14,402 --> 00:32:15,832
- There's cabbage. - This is gochujang bulgogi.

936
00:32:16,032 --> 00:32:17,672
- Here's your stew. - It has squid in it.

937
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:20,331
- I can smell it. - Don't you smell it right away?

938
00:32:20,332 --> 00:32:21,342
The smell is...

939
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:22,972
(Peeking)

940
00:32:25,112 --> 00:32:26,312
It smells good.

941
00:32:26,412 --> 00:32:28,242
Here's your doenjang stew.

942
00:32:28,442 --> 00:32:30,281
- Is it doenjang stew? - Is it served that quickly?

943
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,951
(Doenjang stew straight from the kitchen)

944
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:33,111
- Thank you. - The doenjang stew is...

945
00:32:33,112 --> 00:32:34,622
- clear. - It's transparent.

946
00:32:36,182 --> 00:32:37,821
(Savory doenjang stew...)

947
00:32:37,822 --> 00:32:39,522
(to make you clear your rice bowl immediately)

948
00:32:40,152 --> 00:32:43,162
These days, the manager has to serve others.

949
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:44,492
Of course.

950
00:32:46,262 --> 00:32:48,261
Didn't you see the director a moment ago?

951
00:32:48,262 --> 00:32:49,762
Right.

952
00:32:49,932 --> 00:32:51,131
We need to...

953
00:32:51,132 --> 00:32:52,331
get with the times.

954
00:32:52,332 --> 00:32:53,332
(Salivating)

955
00:32:53,333 --> 00:32:55,142
Gosh, it's hot.

956
00:32:55,472 --> 00:32:58,142
(Gosh, it's hot!)

957
00:33:00,272 --> 00:33:01,311
It's hot.

958
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:03,441
(The manager always makes a mistake.)

959
00:33:03,442 --> 00:33:04,781
- It didn't splash. - No.

960
00:33:04,782 --> 00:33:06,982
- He dropped some broth on himself. - While serving broth...

961
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,182
- He dropped some on his hand. - Are you okay?

962
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,122
This is at 100°C.

963
00:33:12,452 --> 00:33:14,492
(Laughing)

964
00:33:14,662 --> 00:33:15,961
As a martial artist,

965
00:33:15,962 --> 00:33:17,991
aren't you too much of a crybaby?

966
00:33:17,992 --> 00:33:20,231
- Seriously. He said 100°C. - It's close...

967
00:33:20,232 --> 00:33:22,462
- to being 100°C. - This is...

968
00:33:22,632 --> 00:33:23,831
Can you pour...

969
00:33:23,832 --> 00:33:24,971
the remaining?

970
00:33:24,972 --> 00:33:27,002
- Please put it here. - Please put it here.

971
00:33:27,442 --> 00:33:29,641
The food is served so quickly here.

972
00:33:29,642 --> 00:33:32,211
This is soft tofu stew served...

973
00:33:32,212 --> 00:33:33,572
with gochujang bulgogi.

974
00:33:33,742 --> 00:33:34,941
That looks good.

975
00:33:34,942 --> 00:33:35,982
This is...

976
00:33:36,582 --> 00:33:39,981
(Thinly sliced pork)

977
00:33:39,982 --> 00:33:43,722
(Seasoned with sweet and spicy gochujang)

978
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:47,091
(Tender)

979
00:33:47,092 --> 00:33:48,862
(Cooked over high heat)

980
00:33:49,362 --> 00:33:54,832
(Juicy meat that stimulates our salivary glands)

981
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:58,432
(And served for free)

982
00:33:58,802 --> 00:34:02,042
(Spicy soft tofu stew)

983
00:34:02,702 --> 00:34:06,171
(A Korean set menu enjoyed with hot stew)

984
00:34:06,172 --> 00:34:07,341
Enjoy your food.

985
00:34:07,342 --> 00:34:09,011
- Enjoy your food. - Enjoy your food.

986
00:34:09,012 --> 00:34:10,012
(Thank you for the food.)

987
00:34:10,682 --> 00:34:11,751
How...

988
00:34:11,752 --> 00:34:13,381
It's served on a pan.

989
00:34:13,382 --> 00:34:14,651
- I'll stir the meat. - Okay.

990
00:34:14,652 --> 00:34:16,522
Three orders were a must.

991
00:34:17,352 --> 00:34:18,591
It smells amazing.

992
00:34:18,592 --> 00:34:20,822
Can you make me a wrap with some cabbage?

993
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,661
- I'll have it as is first. - As is?

994
00:34:22,662 --> 00:34:23,722
With just some rice.

995
00:34:28,202 --> 00:34:29,802
My gosh. Wrap that over some rice.

996
00:34:29,902 --> 00:34:31,572
- Of course. - Wrap that around.

997
00:34:31,932 --> 00:34:33,701
Look at it steaming. It's at 100°C for sure.

998
00:34:33,702 --> 00:34:35,102
(Seung Ho's also ready.)

999
00:34:38,172 --> 00:34:40,982
(They can't help but exclaim.)

1000
00:34:43,412 --> 00:34:46,051
Nurungji has formed on some of the rice.

1001
00:34:46,052 --> 00:34:49,282
(Touched)

1002
00:34:49,582 --> 00:34:50,851
- How is it? - You'll be wanting more rice.

1003
00:34:50,852 --> 00:34:51,892
How is it?

1004
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:55,462
- The stir-fried pork... - I'm suddenly hungry.

1005
00:34:55,622 --> 00:34:58,291
- The stir-fried pork... - I'm suddenly hungry.

1006
00:34:58,292 --> 00:34:59,931
- is like what my mom made. - The gochujang bulgogi.

1007
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,531
That's exactly what I thought.

1008
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,401
- It's like what my mom made. - The kind you'd expect from Mom.

1009
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:04,531
Is that so?

1010
00:35:04,532 --> 00:35:05,572
(It's like a meal cooked by your mom.)

1011
00:35:06,332 --> 00:35:07,472
It's so good.

1012
00:35:09,142 --> 00:35:11,271
- I'm getting my protein in. - Have it with something else...

1013
00:35:11,272 --> 00:35:12,372
like the dried laver.

1014
00:35:12,912 --> 00:35:15,482
- That's a good idea. - Have it with cabbage too.

1015
00:35:15,682 --> 00:35:17,612
- I'll make a wrap. - Looking good.

1016
00:35:18,312 --> 00:35:19,812
- My gosh. - That's the one.

1017
00:35:20,482 --> 00:35:22,222
There you go. Eat all of that together.

1018
00:35:23,582 --> 00:35:25,722
Can you take a sip of the soup with it?

1019
00:35:26,752 --> 00:35:28,391
- It's so good. - Try the soup.

1020
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:31,032
(Living vicariously)

1021
00:35:31,192 --> 00:35:32,962
Have some of the soft tofu stew too.

1022
00:35:33,062 --> 00:35:34,701
I'll have that next, okay?

1023
00:35:34,702 --> 00:35:36,501
(Let me eat it as I see fit.)

1024
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:38,072
I was wondering when you'd stop him.

1025
00:35:39,132 --> 00:35:41,141
I normally don't enjoy pork with steamed cabbage.

1026
00:35:41,142 --> 00:35:42,142
(Seung Ho quietly enjoys his meal regardless of the others.)

1027
00:35:42,143 --> 00:35:45,672
It's spicy, but there's a sweetness to it.

1028
00:35:45,872 --> 00:35:47,882
- Now that you say that... - Seung Ho, how's the rolled omelet?

1029
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,081
It's good. It's just good.

1030
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:54,122
The rolled omelet...

1031
00:35:54,582 --> 00:35:56,981
Just so you know, when I have rolled omelets...

1032
00:35:56,982 --> 00:35:57,992
(He eats some more the second he's done talking.)

1033
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,521
(Rolled omelet with vegetables straight from the pan)

1034
00:36:00,522 --> 00:36:02,292
(This time, he tries the kimchi.)

1035
00:36:03,792 --> 00:36:04,862
(Yummy)

1036
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:08,601
Did you know that Chinese restaurants...

1037
00:36:08,602 --> 00:36:10,561
serve a really nice egg dish?

1038
00:36:10,562 --> 00:36:12,271
- Tomato and eggs. - Tomato and eggs.

1039
00:36:12,272 --> 00:36:13,771
The two are stir-fried in oil.

1040
00:36:13,772 --> 00:36:16,001
- Can we eat that now? - Gosh, no.

1041
00:36:16,002 --> 00:36:18,211
- Can we finally eat? - Of course not.

1042
00:36:18,212 --> 00:36:19,611
- Come on. - Let us eat already.

1043
00:36:19,612 --> 00:36:21,312
(After saying their piece, they go back to eating.)

1044
00:36:21,582 --> 00:36:22,641
It's so good.

1045
00:36:22,642 --> 00:36:24,651
I normally don't enjoy pork with steamed cabbage.

1046
00:36:24,652 --> 00:36:25,652
(He drinks cold water instead.)

1047
00:36:25,653 --> 00:36:26,782
Sang Uk's dying.

1048
00:36:27,112 --> 00:36:28,482
That looks too good.

1049
00:36:29,152 --> 00:36:30,182
I mean it.

1050
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:31,651
Tell him, will you?

1051
00:36:31,652 --> 00:36:32,921
Give him his mission.

1052
00:36:32,922 --> 00:36:34,462
Sang Uk would love this.

1053
00:36:35,062 --> 00:36:36,361
Give Sang Uk his mission.

1054
00:36:36,362 --> 00:36:37,631
- He's dying. - Is it good?

1055
00:36:37,632 --> 00:36:38,831
(Not caring, he has the rolled omelet.)

1056
00:36:38,832 --> 00:36:39,932
What's the keyword?

1057
00:36:42,102 --> 00:36:43,132
Sang Uk.

1058
00:36:43,732 --> 00:36:45,902
- This is the real deal. - Really?

1059
00:36:46,132 --> 00:36:47,801
(Proving with his expression)

1060
00:36:47,802 --> 00:36:49,072
I get that it's delicious.

1061
00:36:49,702 --> 00:36:51,542
- What do I have to do? - He wants you to give him a chance.

1062
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:53,212
Give us our mission!

1063
00:36:53,612 --> 00:36:54,812
- What? - This isn't like you.

1064
00:36:55,342 --> 00:36:57,242
I can't believe Tae Hyun of all people is desperate.

1065
00:36:57,712 --> 00:36:59,911
- You have to give us a chance... - Check this out.

1066
00:36:59,912 --> 00:37:00,921
to try the food.

1067
00:37:00,922 --> 00:37:02,552
He's right. What is it you want?

1068
00:37:02,582 --> 00:37:03,721
Play rock-paper-scissors.

1069
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,651
- Rock-paper-scissors? Sure. - I like that.

1070
00:37:05,652 --> 00:37:07,561
- Go for it. - We should win this.

1071
00:37:07,562 --> 00:37:09,021
- Let's keep it simple. - Are you going to play mind games?

1072
00:37:09,022 --> 00:37:11,061
If I lose, I won't deserve to try the food.

1073
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,492
Show us how good you are at rock-paper-scissors.

1074
00:37:12,632 --> 00:37:13,832
My hand is already shaped like paper.

1075
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:16,762
I'll play this hand as is. Okay?

1076
00:37:17,032 --> 00:37:18,701
- I can't clench it anyway. - Sure.

1077
00:37:18,702 --> 00:37:19,871
- Your trick is working. - It's stuck in this shape.

1078
00:37:19,872 --> 00:37:21,042
- It's stuck. - Okay.

1079
00:37:21,702 --> 00:37:23,002
This is all that I can play.

1080
00:37:23,142 --> 00:37:25,771
- Sure. - All right. Ready or not,

1081
00:37:25,772 --> 00:37:27,012
rock-paper-scissors.

1082
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:29,381
Rock-paper-scissors.

1083
00:37:29,382 --> 00:37:30,512
(Sang Uk wins!)

1084
00:37:30,712 --> 00:37:34,111
(It doesn't work the second time.)

1085
00:37:34,112 --> 00:37:36,052
- He's so good at this. - You thought it twice over.

1086
00:37:36,352 --> 00:37:37,691
- Twice over. - Yes, twice over.

1087
00:37:37,692 --> 00:37:38,721
Did you think it twice over?

1088
00:37:38,722 --> 00:37:41,221
- Only thinking once had me lose. - Get ready for a bite.

1089
00:37:41,222 --> 00:37:42,621
You can stack them on your spoon.

1090
00:37:42,622 --> 00:37:44,962
- With this... - Allow me to have some.

1091
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:48,431
(He tries all of them at once.)

1092
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,931
It's like this. If I'm going to play scissors...

1093
00:37:50,932 --> 00:37:52,471
Isn't the seasoning on point?

1094
00:37:52,472 --> 00:37:53,472
The marinade is insane.

1095
00:37:55,142 --> 00:37:56,401
- It's incredible. - Right?

1096
00:37:56,402 --> 00:37:59,242
- It'll make you keep wanting rice. - The flavors linger in your mouth.

1097
00:37:59,742 --> 00:38:01,841
(The next player awaits.)

1098
00:38:01,842 --> 00:38:03,911
Nothing beats rock-paper-scissors.

1099
00:38:03,912 --> 00:38:05,112
The two of them can surely eat.

1100
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:06,512
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.

1101
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:07,951
Really? Let the mind games begin.

1102
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,382
- Rock-paper-scissors. - So tell me.

1103
00:38:09,552 --> 00:38:10,582
What will it be this time?

1104
00:38:11,552 --> 00:38:13,122
- Think twice over. - What will you play?

1105
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:14,261
- Me? - Yes.

1106
00:38:14,262 --> 00:38:15,662
- He's asking this time around. - Why did you shake things up?

1107
00:38:15,892 --> 00:38:16,892
He's asking Tae Hyun what he will play.

1108
00:38:16,893 --> 00:38:17,931
I'll play rock.

1109
00:38:17,932 --> 00:38:19,162
Then I'll play scissors.

1110
00:38:19,532 --> 00:38:20,731
- Then you'll lose. - You can win.

1111
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:23,161
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1112
00:38:23,162 --> 00:38:24,232
- See? - No way.

1113
00:38:24,772 --> 00:38:27,942
(You liar...)

1114
00:38:28,442 --> 00:38:29,541
(Dong Hyun wins!)

1115
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:31,411
There's no use overthinking it.

1116
00:38:31,412 --> 00:38:32,511
One spoonful isn't enough.

1117
00:38:32,512 --> 00:38:33,912
Are you going to end it at that?

1118
00:38:34,072 --> 00:38:35,581
- Are you going to lose to him? - Will you end this as a loser?

1119
00:38:35,582 --> 00:38:37,612
I'll let you win so that you could have some.

1120
00:38:38,052 --> 00:38:39,312
- I'll play rock. - Sure.

1121
00:38:39,882 --> 00:38:41,122
- Beat me. - Got it.

1122
00:38:41,182 --> 00:38:42,622
Only a fool would lose to me.

1123
00:38:42,722 --> 00:38:45,391
- What if you play something else? - Have some of this.

1124
00:38:45,392 --> 00:38:47,121
- That means you're bad. - He's playing mind games.

1125
00:38:47,122 --> 00:38:49,292
- That's... - That makes you a complete jerk.

1126
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,232
Tae Hyun, why are you so angry?

1127
00:38:52,492 --> 00:38:54,461
- He's an utter jerk. - Hold on.

1128
00:38:54,462 --> 00:38:57,132
Are you irritated that you lost the game to me?

1129
00:38:58,132 --> 00:39:00,471
You'll be the worst of the worst.

1130
00:39:00,472 --> 00:39:02,401
Okay. Whatever. We need to wrap this up and move on.

1131
00:39:02,402 --> 00:39:04,912
Play rock-paper-scissors. I'll keep eating.

1132
00:39:05,312 --> 00:39:06,811
- Let's play, then. - I won't look.

1133
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:10,582
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

1134
00:39:11,852 --> 00:39:12,911
Why you...

1135
00:39:12,912 --> 00:39:14,111
(What a weasel.)

1136
00:39:14,112 --> 00:39:15,782
I was going to play rock,

1137
00:39:16,282 --> 00:39:18,522
but I changed to paper after Tae Hyun called him out.

1138
00:39:19,492 --> 00:39:21,521
(You win, Dong Hyun.)

1139
00:39:21,522 --> 00:39:22,661
- Unbelievable. - When playing a game,

1140
00:39:22,662 --> 00:39:23,821
you can't be fazed by anything.

1141
00:39:23,822 --> 00:39:25,331
- We're contending for victory. - Exactly.

1142
00:39:25,332 --> 00:39:26,491
All you have to do is win.

1143
00:39:26,492 --> 00:39:27,732
It's time to bring out our credit cards.

1144
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,462
The price of the dishes is insane.

1145
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:32,331
- Exactly. - I agree.

1146
00:39:32,332 --> 00:39:33,802
Honestly,

1147
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:37,442
I loved how it felt like I was eating a home-cooked meal.

1148
00:39:38,072 --> 00:39:40,212
Not one of the dishes outshone the others.

1149
00:39:40,642 --> 00:39:42,441
- They were all equally delicious. - That's most important.

1150
00:39:42,442 --> 00:39:45,081
- That's why people have it daily. - We had gochujang bulgogi,

1151
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,612
but I'm the one who polished off all the side dishes.

1152
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,681
- Even the jeon. - Everything looked good.

1153
00:39:49,682 --> 00:39:50,722
The meal was delicious.

1154
00:39:51,492 --> 00:39:52,492
Now, it's time for a quiz.

1155
00:39:52,922 --> 00:39:54,661
We're at a disadvantage with it being only us two.

1156
00:39:54,662 --> 00:39:55,662
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

1157
00:39:55,663 --> 00:39:58,832
- What? - Let's do this.

1158
00:40:01,432 --> 00:40:03,532
- Look at this painting first. - This is great.

1159
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,001
Let's stay calm.

1160
00:40:05,002 --> 00:40:06,172
It's already a challenge.

1161
00:40:06,232 --> 00:40:07,632
- What is it? - It's hard to understand.

1162
00:40:07,802 --> 00:40:10,371
- It's one from a long time ago. - This is the painting.

1163
00:40:10,372 --> 00:40:12,342
- We'll look at it in detail. - Sure.

1164
00:40:12,642 --> 00:40:13,742
I bet they're having bulgogi.

1165
00:40:14,342 --> 00:40:17,141
This is a painting of Joseon noblemen...

1166
00:40:17,142 --> 00:40:19,882
grilling and eating meat.

1167
00:40:20,052 --> 00:40:21,482
- The culture goes way back. - Yes.

1168
00:40:21,982 --> 00:40:25,021
In the painting, a specialized griddle...

1169
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:27,022
known as "jeonlibtu" is depicted.

1170
00:40:27,192 --> 00:40:29,621
- Jeonlibtu? - Jeonlibtu.

1171
00:40:29,622 --> 00:40:33,362
"Jeonlib" refers to an object used by Joseon military officers.

1172
00:40:33,762 --> 00:40:34,931
What was it?

1173
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,731
- A shield. - What?

1174
00:40:36,732 --> 00:40:38,231
- A hat. - A hat?

1175
00:40:38,232 --> 00:40:40,201
- It ends with "tu." - Oh, right.

1176
00:40:40,202 --> 00:40:41,401
- Jeonlibtu. - That's right.

1177
00:40:41,402 --> 00:40:44,202
At first sight, I thought it was a gat...

1178
00:40:44,642 --> 00:40:46,142
because of how it was hollow in the center.

1179
00:40:46,442 --> 00:40:50,941
Military officers back then would've worn hats made out of steel.

1180
00:40:50,942 --> 00:40:52,512
- Really? - Won't it have been heavy?

1181
00:40:53,282 --> 00:40:56,452
Is this a military officer in the far back?

1182
00:40:57,052 --> 00:40:58,091
- What? - No?

1183
00:40:58,092 --> 00:40:59,621
Didn't he say they were noblemen?

1184
00:40:59,622 --> 00:41:01,562
- In the back. - They're arguing again.

1185
00:41:01,962 --> 00:41:04,021
It seems as though they're standing in the back...

1186
00:41:04,022 --> 00:41:05,461
- looking sullen. - Him?

1187
00:41:05,462 --> 00:41:06,932
This is that guy's knee.

1188
00:41:09,332 --> 00:41:11,532
- Right here. It's his knee. - I see.

1189
00:41:12,602 --> 00:41:14,472
This is a rock.

1190
00:41:15,142 --> 00:41:17,171
- Is it a rock? - This is his knee.

1191
00:41:17,172 --> 00:41:18,211
(He kindly breaks down the painting for Dong Hyun.)

1192
00:41:18,212 --> 00:41:19,341
Okay, sorry about that.

1193
00:41:19,342 --> 00:41:21,242
- His knee. - He has long legs.

1194
00:41:21,912 --> 00:41:23,282
His leg is shooting out.

1195
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:25,881
That must be his foot.

1196
00:41:25,882 --> 00:41:28,381
It's either a shield or a helmet.

1197
00:41:28,382 --> 00:41:30,552
- I think so too. - But...

1198
00:41:31,192 --> 00:41:33,692
What's a "jeonlib?" Jeon...

1199
00:41:34,022 --> 00:41:36,922
It must be a shield. Jeon means "in the front."

1200
00:41:37,422 --> 00:41:39,032
You hold shields in front of you.

1201
00:41:39,232 --> 00:41:40,791
Holding it up front.

1202
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:42,131
- He's right. - You see it in other words too.

1203
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:44,162
I most certainly believe that it's a shield,

1204
00:41:44,232 --> 00:41:46,572
but I'm wondering if we've missed anything.

1205
00:41:47,302 --> 00:41:49,271
- We'll go with shield. - Give it more thought.

1206
00:41:49,272 --> 00:41:50,902
(Foreshadowing)

1207
00:41:51,272 --> 00:41:52,441
(He already looked up the answer.)

1208
00:41:52,442 --> 00:41:53,712
It was to suss them out.

1209
00:41:54,072 --> 00:41:55,211
Every round is a game of the mind.

1210
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,282
Is it a helmet?

1211
00:41:56,542 --> 00:41:59,081
It has to block arrows that come up to about here.

1212
00:41:59,082 --> 00:42:00,251
Arrows shoot down like so.

1213
00:42:00,252 --> 00:42:01,551
They fire arrows like this.

1214
00:42:01,552 --> 00:42:02,821
- Arrows. - Because they come like this?

1215
00:42:02,822 --> 00:42:04,082
They were blocked like so.

1216
00:42:04,552 --> 00:42:05,692
- So... - You're right.

1217
00:42:06,122 --> 00:42:07,392
Won't it hurt their necks?

1218
00:42:07,792 --> 00:42:09,091
- Like an umbrella? - They'd block them.

1219
00:42:09,092 --> 00:42:10,161
- Like an umbrella? - Yes.

1220
00:42:10,162 --> 00:42:11,162
Which is why they were wide?

1221
00:42:11,492 --> 00:42:13,291
- It's a shield. - Let's go with shield.

1222
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:15,231
As soldiers in the military,

1223
00:42:15,232 --> 00:42:17,431
we grilled eggs on shovels. I'm thinking it's the same.

1224
00:42:17,432 --> 00:42:19,202
I think it's safe to go with shield.

1225
00:42:19,302 --> 00:42:20,831
- I can't think of anything else. - It's like this.

1226
00:42:20,832 --> 00:42:22,142
Almost immediately, I thought of a shield.

1227
00:42:23,072 --> 00:42:24,841
- Would you like to answer? - Go ahead.

1228
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:26,472
Sure. The answer is shield.

1229
00:42:27,982 --> 00:42:29,041
Shield?

1230
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:30,042
- Incorrect. - What?

1231
00:42:32,512 --> 00:42:34,752
- I told you I was better at this. - Hold on.

1232
00:42:35,282 --> 00:42:36,852
Why don't we hear what the answer is?

1233
00:42:37,582 --> 00:42:39,292
- Is it a hat? - It's a hat.

1234
00:42:40,422 --> 00:42:42,791
My gosh! I told you it was a hat.

1235
00:42:42,792 --> 00:42:44,391
- What? - That's what I said!

1236
00:42:44,392 --> 00:42:46,561
- What's with him? - I said it was a hat!

1237
00:42:46,562 --> 00:42:47,792
He was right.

1238
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:52,531
The griddle resembled a certain hat worn by military officers.

1239
00:42:52,532 --> 00:42:54,272
That's why it was named jeonlibtu.

1240
00:42:55,842 --> 00:42:56,902
I was right about it being a hat.

1241
00:42:57,842 --> 00:42:58,971
Give us another quiz,

1242
00:42:58,972 --> 00:43:00,742
and we'll settle this without wasting any time.

1243
00:43:01,282 --> 00:43:02,442
- Shall we? - Yes.

1244
00:43:03,712 --> 00:43:05,811
Some time ago, a food company...

1245
00:43:05,812 --> 00:43:07,882
- first released this... - What?

1246
00:43:08,552 --> 00:43:10,222
in a powdered form.

1247
00:43:10,252 --> 00:43:11,521
Weren't we asked this before?

1248
00:43:11,522 --> 00:43:14,121
Instructions on how this should be consumed...

1249
00:43:14,122 --> 00:43:16,121
were written on the wrapper...

1250
00:43:16,122 --> 00:43:17,692
for consumers unfamiliar with how to eat it.

1251
00:43:18,132 --> 00:43:20,832
Here are the instructions. When you don't have an appetite.

1252
00:43:21,662 --> 00:43:23,362
To provide nutrients for children.

1253
00:43:23,662 --> 00:43:27,102
As breakfast for fathers who drank the day before.

1254
00:43:27,902 --> 00:43:29,171
What is this?

1255
00:43:29,172 --> 00:43:30,641
- Powder as a hangover cure? - Is it a powder?

1256
00:43:30,642 --> 00:43:31,672
Yes, it's a powder.

1257
00:43:31,772 --> 00:43:32,872
Hurry up and answer.

1258
00:43:34,072 --> 00:43:35,942
- What could it be? - Seung Ho, get the answer.

1259
00:43:36,242 --> 00:43:37,412
Say whatever comes to mind.

1260
00:43:37,582 --> 00:43:38,852
Just say anything.

1261
00:43:39,212 --> 00:43:41,182
Seung Ho, say anything to narrow the field.

1262
00:43:42,352 --> 00:43:43,352
Let me answer.

1263
00:43:44,082 --> 00:43:45,921
- Powdered eggs. - Powdered eggs? Incorrect.

1264
00:43:45,922 --> 00:43:46,922
That made sense...

1265
00:43:46,923 --> 00:43:48,322
in terms of nutrients and as a hangover cure.

1266
00:43:48,392 --> 00:43:50,121
- Cheonggukjang. - Cheonggukjang? Incorrect.

1267
00:43:50,122 --> 00:43:51,462
- That also made sense. - You were onto something.

1268
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:54,192
Is it still sold?

1269
00:43:54,602 --> 00:43:55,862
- Of course. - Is it heavily consumed?

1270
00:43:56,362 --> 00:43:57,432
Yes.

1271
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:58,932
Can you buy it at the supermarket?

1272
00:43:59,232 --> 00:44:00,272
Yes.

1273
00:44:00,972 --> 00:44:02,402
Power sold at supermarkets.

1274
00:44:02,702 --> 00:44:05,112
- What can be nutritious for kids? - This is tough.

1275
00:44:05,272 --> 00:44:06,341
It's been a while...

1276
00:44:06,342 --> 00:44:07,372
since we came across one we all didn't know.

1277
00:44:08,742 --> 00:44:09,881
(Pondering)

1278
00:44:09,882 --> 00:44:10,942
- Let me answer. - What?

1279
00:44:11,142 --> 00:44:12,282
Ramyeon seasoning?

1280
00:44:12,452 --> 00:44:14,781
- Incorrect. - What are the powders sold?

1281
00:44:14,782 --> 00:44:15,921
This is a tough one.

1282
00:44:15,922 --> 00:44:18,021
(Ramyeon seasoning?)

1283
00:44:18,022 --> 00:44:19,352
Let me answer. Instant soup.

1284
00:44:19,552 --> 00:44:20,552
- Correct. - What?

1285
00:44:20,553 --> 00:44:21,661
(Soup)

1286
00:44:21,662 --> 00:44:22,922
- Gosh. Soup? - Yes.

1287
00:44:23,122 --> 00:44:25,291
It came to my mind when he said ramyeon seasoning.

1288
00:44:25,292 --> 00:44:26,861
- "Instant soup!" - Soup. Gosh.

1289
00:44:26,862 --> 00:44:28,161
(That's right.)

1290
00:44:28,162 --> 00:44:29,331
It's a soup like a mushroom soup.

1291
00:44:29,332 --> 00:44:31,632
- They still sell it. - Yes.

1292
00:44:32,332 --> 00:44:34,971
(Have Santa Soup as a simple breakfast, with bread,)

1293
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:37,502
(as a nutritious meal or snack for children, to increase appetite.)

1294
00:44:38,112 --> 00:44:39,942
- You're good, Dong Hyun. - Right.

1295
00:44:40,612 --> 00:44:41,712
The evil is punished, and the good is rewarded.

(Paying back for the cod soup incident)

1297
00:44:45,052 --> 00:44:46,381
Seung Ho will pay for this.

1298
00:44:46,382 --> 00:44:47,811
Yes. Swipe your card.

1299
00:44:47,812 --> 00:44:49,181
- Why? - I'll wire the money.

1300
00:44:49,182 --> 00:44:50,881
I don't trust you.

1301
00:44:50,882 --> 00:44:52,091
(I don't trust you.)

1302
00:44:52,092 --> 00:44:53,791
You were the one who played rock-paper-scissors...

1303
00:44:53,792 --> 00:44:55,521
- like this. - But...

1304
00:44:55,522 --> 00:44:57,561
- The daily interest is 200 percent. - It'll double up.

1305
00:44:57,562 --> 00:44:59,531
- I'll wire it to you right away. - Okay.

1306
00:44:59,532 --> 00:45:01,331
- "The interest will double daily." - It'll be doubled by the day.

1307
00:45:01,332 --> 00:45:03,431
- We'd like to pay. - He just hated it.

1308
00:45:03,432 --> 00:45:04,671
- It's 48 dollars, right? - Yes.

1309
00:45:04,672 --> 00:45:07,302
- I'll send it to you here. - Yes. Send it precisely right away.

1310
00:45:08,072 --> 00:45:09,801
(Wiring the money right away as promised)

1311
00:45:09,802 --> 00:45:11,772
- It's amazing. - He's sending it, so wait for it.

1312
00:45:11,842 --> 00:45:13,972
- I wired it. You can check. - Check it.

1313
00:45:14,472 --> 00:45:16,442
I'm not going to be fooled.

1314
00:45:16,712 --> 00:45:18,112
He's saying that even before checking it.

1315
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:20,011
You can't fool me.

1316
00:45:20,012 --> 00:45:21,182
I wired it to you, right?

1317
00:45:23,752 --> 00:45:25,892
Why are you looking at it so carefully?

1318
00:45:25,922 --> 00:45:27,622
- Let me see. - How much is it?

1319
00:45:27,722 --> 00:45:30,992
He just sent me a message as if he wired it.

1320
00:45:31,092 --> 00:45:33,391
- Come on. - What is that?

1321
00:45:33,392 --> 00:45:34,801
Let me explain.

1322
00:45:34,802 --> 00:45:36,031
- Dong Hyun, - For goodness sake.

1323
00:45:36,032 --> 00:45:38,401
- my friends were fooled by it. - What is that?

1324
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,271
Be careful of phishing scams.

1325
00:45:40,272 --> 00:45:41,572
This is how they do it.

1326
00:45:41,942 --> 00:45:44,001
- I'll send it again. - When are you sending it, then?

1327
00:45:44,002 --> 00:45:45,741
- I'm wiring the money right now. - You.

1328
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,572
- I'm really sending it this time. - That's true.

1329
00:45:47,742 --> 00:45:49,241
Please. Don't try to swindle me again.

1330
00:45:49,242 --> 00:45:51,382
It's real this time. Clean and simple.

1331
00:45:51,612 --> 00:45:53,881
- You wired me 50 dollars. - It includes the fee from the scam.

1332
00:45:53,882 --> 00:45:55,621
(He added 2 dollars for the scam he performed.)

1333
00:45:55,622 --> 00:45:57,722
- Does that make you happy? - You made some money.

1334
00:45:58,152 --> 00:45:59,221
Do you think you've made money?

1335
00:45:59,222 --> 00:46:01,251
I should call and check to see if I really got the money.

1336
00:46:01,252 --> 00:46:02,821
(He finishes the meal that turned out to be a good one.)

1412
00:48:45,692 --> 00:48:47,692
(Nodding positively)

1413
00:48:48,222 --> 00:48:50,822
Actually, each of our members...

1414
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:53,061
is showing their capabilities.

1415
00:48:53,062 --> 00:48:55,632
See? We're paying for the food in such an order.

1416
00:48:55,832 --> 00:48:56,832
In the right order?

1417
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:57,961
Who paid first?

1418
00:48:57,962 --> 00:49:01,701
- You. - Was I the first one to pay?

1419
00:49:01,702 --> 00:49:02,702
(Was I the first one to pay?)

1420
00:49:04,342 --> 00:49:06,142
You're grasping the situation very well.

1421
00:49:06,512 --> 00:49:08,312
- You know yourself well. - It's in the right order.

1422
00:49:08,842 --> 00:49:10,082
That's true.

1423
00:49:10,642 --> 00:49:12,082
(Eating)

1424
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:16,482
(In the meantime, he can't give up the desserts.)

1425
00:49:16,652 --> 00:49:17,721
Gosh. It's so...

1426
00:49:17,722 --> 00:49:19,152
- It's a little. - Isn't it so good?

1427
00:49:19,422 --> 00:49:21,661
- This canele is... - By the way,

1428
00:49:21,662 --> 00:49:23,621
you know this stuff well when you don't look like so.

1429
00:49:23,622 --> 00:49:25,032
What do you mean?

1430
00:49:25,332 --> 00:49:28,231
- I look like a cheonggukjang lover. - Exactly.

1431
00:49:28,232 --> 00:49:29,932
But I love this kind of dessert.

1432
00:49:29,962 --> 00:49:32,232
It has an egg mixture in it.

1433
00:49:33,132 --> 00:49:35,542
It has a moist mixture in it.

1434
00:49:35,742 --> 00:49:37,441
So, it's not too sweet.

1435
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:39,541
- It's perfect with coffee. - It's tasty.

1436
00:49:39,542 --> 00:49:40,811
(Canele, a dessert that is crunchy outside, soft inside)

1437
00:49:40,812 --> 00:49:43,511
Now that we had our desserts,

1438
00:49:43,512 --> 00:49:45,182
let's choose the menus for dinner.

1439
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:48,012
We have to have it with drinks, right?

1440
00:49:48,582 --> 00:49:50,822
Isn't it something like grilled pork belly with soju?

1441
00:49:51,582 --> 00:49:53,291
- While eating pork belly... - Pork belly and soju.

1442
00:49:53,292 --> 00:49:55,221
- Pork belly and soju. - For dinner...

1443
00:49:55,222 --> 00:49:56,761
Dinner is something you have...

1444
00:49:56,762 --> 00:49:58,431
after working really hard.

1445
00:49:58,432 --> 00:50:00,731
That idea of eating good food can be why they work.

1446
00:50:00,732 --> 00:50:02,101
"I want something really tasty."

1447
00:50:02,102 --> 00:50:03,732
Then they go to a nice beef restaurant...

1448
00:50:03,862 --> 00:50:06,001
or somewhere it's impossible to make a reservation.

1449
00:50:06,002 --> 00:50:07,002
- They go somewhere like that. - That's right.
They go...

1450
00:50:08,003 --> 00:50:09,301
- to fine-dining restaurants a lot. - Fine-dining restaurants.

1451
00:50:09,302 --> 00:50:10,541
"Fine-dining?"

1452
00:50:10,542 --> 00:50:13,541
These days, instead of going on a trip...

1453
00:50:13,542 --> 00:50:15,141
because it's hard to go,

1454
00:50:15,142 --> 00:50:17,182
they have nice dinners to complement it.

1455
00:50:17,212 --> 00:50:18,851
(So here is today's DMR.)

1456
00:50:18,852 --> 00:50:21,312
(Dinner Menu Recommendation)

1457
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:25,451
(After work, go and eat meat.)

1458
00:50:25,452 --> 00:50:29,292
(Marinated pork belly)

1459
00:50:29,592 --> 00:50:33,861
(All sorts of delicacies are served.)

1460
00:50:33,862 --> 00:50:37,062
(A fine-dining for a special meal)

1461
00:50:37,832 --> 00:50:41,872
We have to choose between pork belly and fine-dining course.

1462
00:50:43,102 --> 00:50:45,342
I just have to have pork belly with soju.

1463
00:50:46,012 --> 00:50:48,482
Only after having pork belly with soju, I can say,

1464
00:50:48,882 --> 00:50:50,841
"Okay. I'm off work. I'm done for the day."

1465
00:50:50,842 --> 00:50:53,682
That is the way to feel that way.

1466
00:50:53,852 --> 00:50:56,021
How much is the fine-dining meal?

1467
00:50:56,022 --> 00:50:57,321
The cheapest one is 190 dollars.

1468
00:50:57,322 --> 00:50:58,891
- It starts from there? - It's 190 dollars.

1469
00:50:58,892 --> 00:51:01,551
Then it goes up to 220 dollars and 250 dollars.

1470
00:51:01,552 --> 00:51:03,192
- For a course meal? - Yes.

1471
00:51:03,422 --> 00:51:04,891
- Okay. In that case, - For a fine-dining course?

1472
00:51:04,892 --> 00:51:06,691
Mr. Kim will go and have a fine-dining meal.

1473
00:51:06,692 --> 00:51:08,161
(A sudden business trip to have a fine-dining meal)

1474
00:51:08,162 --> 00:51:09,831
- Go and have a fine-dining meal. - Intern Oh.

1475
00:51:09,832 --> 00:51:11,231
- Fine-dining experience. - Yes. A fine-dining experience.

1476
00:51:11,232 --> 00:51:12,731
What about Seung Ho?

1477
00:51:12,732 --> 00:51:14,131
What are you going to have, Seung Ho?

1478
00:51:14,132 --> 00:51:15,801
- I'm still thinking about it. - Yes.

1479
00:51:15,802 --> 00:51:17,401
We just need to get the quiz right.

1480
00:51:17,402 --> 00:51:19,271
Join us for a fine-dining experience.

1481
00:51:19,272 --> 00:51:20,741
We've never had it before. Join us.

1482
00:51:20,742 --> 00:51:21,881
(What will Seung Ho choose?)

1483
00:51:21,882 --> 00:51:23,181
I'll go with the fine-dining.

1484
00:51:23,182 --> 00:51:24,681
- Good. - That's right.

1485
00:51:24,682 --> 00:51:26,212
- Good. Why did you choose it? - Fine-dining?

1486
00:51:26,352 --> 00:51:27,852
If I go for the pork belly,

1487
00:51:27,982 --> 00:51:29,452
I'll get the quiz right.

1488
00:51:29,782 --> 00:51:31,321
When I join them,

1489
00:51:31,322 --> 00:51:32,991
- We'll get the quiz right. - even if we get the quiz wrong,

1490
00:51:32,992 --> 00:51:34,752
I won't be the one who will be paying for it.

1491
00:51:35,162 --> 00:51:36,261
(It's a group of people who are bad at taking quizzes.)

1492
00:51:36,262 --> 00:51:37,492
If...

1493
00:51:37,622 --> 00:51:38,931
we get the quiz right,

1494
00:51:38,932 --> 00:51:40,232
you will be the one who will pay for it.

1495
00:51:40,992 --> 00:51:42,501
Handsome Trading Company, let's go.

1496
00:51:42,502 --> 00:51:44,062
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1497
00:51:44,632 --> 00:51:45,671
This is the real match.

1498
00:51:45,672 --> 00:51:47,301
Gosh. The weather is nice.

1499
00:51:47,302 --> 00:51:48,401
It's so nice.

1500
00:51:48,402 --> 00:51:49,602
(The members are happy after having desserts.)

1501
00:51:50,042 --> 00:51:52,641
For the five of us to walk like this in Yeouido,

1502
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:54,511
it feels like we're a team...

1503
00:51:54,512 --> 00:51:56,411
that handles important tasks for the company.

1504
00:51:56,412 --> 00:51:58,581
- It's Handsome Trading Company. - Handsome Trading Company.

1505
00:51:58,582 --> 00:52:00,411
We're on our way to have a company dinner.

1506
00:52:00,412 --> 00:52:02,981
We keep eating rather than working.

1507
00:52:02,982 --> 00:52:06,021
Gosh. When do we work?

1508
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:07,991
- That's the one. - It says seolleongtang.

1509
00:52:07,992 --> 00:52:09,191
Marinated pork belly.

1510
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:10,761
- That's funnier. - It's been here since 1979.

1511
00:52:10,762 --> 00:52:11,932
What an incredible sign.

1512
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,791
- It has to be tasty. - That's right.

1513
00:52:14,792 --> 00:52:15,861
It's funny how it says,

1514
00:52:15,862 --> 00:52:17,532
- "We don't sell seolleongtang." - It's written on it.

1515
00:52:17,902 --> 00:52:19,101
(They don't have seolleongtang while they look like they do.)

1516
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:20,931
- It has to be tasty. - There's no doubt.

1517
00:52:20,932 --> 00:52:23,302
It's already been verified.

1518
00:52:23,942 --> 00:52:25,741
I work in Yeouido.

1519
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:28,371
I come here a lot of times when I want to have pork belly.

1520
00:52:28,372 --> 00:52:29,981
I've come all the way from Nowon-gu to have it.

1521
00:52:29,982 --> 00:52:32,481
I've come from Chungjeongno after work...

1522
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,711
because I heard there's a good restaurant here.

1523
00:52:34,712 --> 00:52:37,651
I have to wait because many are waiting.

1524
00:52:37,652 --> 00:52:40,792
(You have to wait to get in. It's praised highly.)

1525
00:52:41,252 --> 00:52:43,191
(Handsome's DMR 1, Koreans' soul food)

1526
00:52:43,192 --> 00:52:45,832
(Pork belly)

1527
00:52:46,392 --> 00:52:49,331
- Should I sit inside? - I wonder if they can endure it.

1528
00:52:49,332 --> 00:52:50,532
Can you endure it?

1529
00:52:50,562 --> 00:52:53,972
- Of course. - Are you sure about it?

1530
00:52:54,232 --> 00:52:56,401
We'll have it and leave.

1531
00:52:56,402 --> 00:52:58,572
What kind of company are we...

1532
00:52:59,112 --> 00:53:00,412
that we only keep eating?

1533
00:53:00,772 --> 00:53:02,011
- We just keep eating. - It's a food company.

1534
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,012
What company are we?

1535
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,211
We're a marketing firm.

1536
00:53:04,212 --> 00:53:06,082
- A marketing firm. - Are we a marketing firm?

1537
00:53:06,452 --> 00:53:08,481
- Finally, I know what it is. - You know that, right?

1538
00:53:08,482 --> 00:53:10,451
While trying the food,

1539
00:53:10,452 --> 00:53:13,552
we think of how we can sell the food.

1540
00:53:13,592 --> 00:53:14,821
I see that...

1541
00:53:14,822 --> 00:53:17,821
they only sell pork belly and beef rib fingers.

1542
00:53:17,822 --> 00:53:19,761
- They only have seonjiguk. - But...

1543
00:53:19,762 --> 00:53:21,091
it's not an ordinary pork belly.

1544
00:53:21,092 --> 00:53:22,461
It comes with a sauce.

1545
00:53:22,462 --> 00:53:24,331
- You dip the meat in it. - He did some research.

1546
00:53:24,332 --> 00:53:25,901
You dip it.

1547
00:53:25,902 --> 00:53:27,331
- You dip it before you have it. - You have to eat it well.

1548
00:53:27,332 --> 00:53:29,072
(It's a pork belly you grill with the sauce.)

1549
00:53:29,602 --> 00:53:30,901
- Gosh. - It's a simple menu.

1550
00:53:30,902 --> 00:53:32,511
How many servings are we having?

1551
00:53:32,512 --> 00:53:34,471
Let's order two servings of the pork belly for now.

1552
00:53:34,472 --> 00:53:37,081
But we're 5 people, so you should order 5 servings.

1553
00:53:37,082 --> 00:53:38,782
- We're 2 people. - We are a party of 2.

1554
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:41,111
- We're sitting here with you. - You said...

1555
00:53:41,112 --> 00:53:43,452
- you could endure it. - I'll prepare an acrostic poem.

1556
00:53:44,422 --> 00:53:46,451
- Mr. Owner? - "Mr. Owner."

1557
00:53:46,452 --> 00:53:48,861
- Gosh. Hello. - Hello.

1558
00:53:48,862 --> 00:53:51,061
- You're younger than expected. - Pardon?

1559
00:53:51,062 --> 00:53:52,231
- Are you the owner? - Yes.

1560
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:54,231
Are you the second-generation owner?

1561
00:53:54,232 --> 00:53:56,901
Yes. My parents had run it since 1979.

1562
00:53:56,902 --> 00:53:58,202
Now I'm running it as a second generation.

1563
00:53:59,232 --> 00:54:02,041
I want to know why it is called seolleongtang.

1564
00:54:02,042 --> 00:54:04,302
We started off as a seolleongtang restaurant.

1565
00:54:04,802 --> 00:54:06,071
- I see. - We don't make it anymore.

1566
00:54:06,072 --> 00:54:07,371
We sold seolleongtang at first,

1567
00:54:07,372 --> 00:54:09,241
but we changed into a barbecue place later.

1568
00:54:09,242 --> 00:54:10,982
- But you didn't change the name. - No.

1569
00:54:11,042 --> 00:54:12,951
- We've used it for a long time. - I see.

1570
00:54:12,952 --> 00:54:14,511
- We'll order two pork belly... - Okay.

1571
00:54:14,512 --> 00:54:16,021
and one seonjiguk.

1572
00:54:16,022 --> 00:54:18,591
We serve 1 seonjiguk for free for 2 orders of meat.

1573
00:54:18,592 --> 00:54:19,791
- You serve it for free? - Yes.

1574
00:54:19,792 --> 00:54:21,051
- Thank you. - That will be our order.

1575
00:54:21,052 --> 00:54:22,691
If it's free for every two people...

1576
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:24,361
- No. Don't mind them. - That's right.

1577
00:54:24,362 --> 00:54:25,961
- Should we prepare a table for two? - Yes.

1578
00:54:25,962 --> 00:54:26,962
Just for two.

1579
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,862
(Disappointed)

1580
00:54:30,932 --> 00:54:34,032
(Soon, the charcoal comes in.)

1581
00:54:34,832 --> 00:54:35,902
Gosh.

1582
00:54:36,072 --> 00:54:38,471
- This is the sauce. - That looks really good. I see.

1583
00:54:38,472 --> 00:54:39,712
This is the special sauce, isn't it?

1584
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:42,639
Yes. This is the sauce.

1585
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:43,739
Can I smell it?

1586
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,009
You can smell it.

1587
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:46,080
- Gosh, this is... - I see.

1588
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,240
- It reminds me of something. - The chicken skewers?

1589
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:49,809
- Yes. - I can tell.

1590
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:51,779
It's the sauce for the chicken skewers...

1591
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,049
- we had when we were young. - You're right.

1592
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,350
- Thank you. - You really have to try it.

1593
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:58,760
It's very unique. They must have created the method.

1594
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:01,090
Why is this place so popular?

1595
00:55:01,260 --> 00:55:02,330
Because it's delicious.

1596
00:55:02,860 --> 00:55:03,989
It's not that expensive either.

1597
00:55:03,990 --> 00:55:05,860
I think the sauce has the key.

1598
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,599
It already smells good while getting cooked.

1599
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,929
Look how rich this seonjiguk is.

1600
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,829
- Gosh. - I'm going to have it.

1601
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:12,999
- Actually, I love... - I'm going to smell it.

1602
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,570
seonjiguk.

1603
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:17,709
It's in a hot stone pot, so it has to be tasty.

1604
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:18,940
I agree.

1605
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,639
Some don't like it, but you like it, Tae Hyun?

1606
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,780
- I like it. - This is what it is.

1607
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:27,680
Gosh. It's good as expected.

1608
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:29,489
- Mr. Lee. - Yes.

1609
00:55:29,490 --> 00:55:32,059
Would you give me the honor...

1610
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:34,219
to grill the meat for you?

1611
00:55:34,220 --> 00:55:35,360
No, I'll grill it myself.

1612
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,459
- You said you'd not do that. - Stop that already.

1613
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:39,229
It's because they should grill the meat like that.

1614
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:41,260
- What are you talking about? - You're mistreating the meat.

1615
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:42,699
You flipped it too quickly. Gosh.

1616
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,769
Just wait. What do you think the sauce is for?

1617
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:46,799
- What are we supposed to do? - Gosh.

1618
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:49,070
I used to work at a pork belly place.

1619
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:51,039
Really? You grill it well. It looks delicious.

1620
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,040
Of course.

1621
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:53,739
Gosh. This is really good.

1622
00:55:53,740 --> 00:55:54,910
- Is it ready already? - Of course.

1623
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:56,950
Okay. I'll give it a try, then.

1624
00:55:57,250 --> 00:55:59,280
Will it bring back the memories?

1625
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,689
Everyone, he's eating it.

1626
00:56:02,690 --> 00:56:03,690
(Amazed)

1627
00:56:03,890 --> 00:56:05,989
(He is already amazed with the first bite.)

1628
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:06,990
(It's good.)

1629
00:56:06,991 --> 00:56:08,589
- Is it that good? - Tae Hyun, it looks so good.

1630
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:09,960
Hey. It's so good. Yes.

1631
00:56:10,230 --> 00:56:11,790
Gosh. It's superb.

1632
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:13,459
(Yi Kyung hurries and tries a piece too.)

1633
00:56:13,460 --> 00:56:14,930
- Gosh. It's been so long. - Right now.

1634
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,070
- Gosh. - You have to put all of them on it.

1635
00:56:18,470 --> 00:56:19,540
Put all of them on.

1636
00:56:19,670 --> 00:56:22,070
I can guarantee that one can't eat it...

1637
00:56:22,470 --> 00:56:24,510
will get very angry today.

1638
00:56:24,770 --> 00:56:26,139
- Are you going to be all right? - You'll be really angry.

1639
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:27,939
- Are you all right? - Will you be okay with it?

1640
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:29,349
- Are you good? - Yes. I'm good.

1641
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:30,350
Gosh. It's so tasty.

1642
00:56:30,580 --> 00:56:32,950
(I'm not all right.)

1643
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:34,879
Does the sauce make a difference?

1644
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,519
- It's totally different. - It's completely different.

1645
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,549
This is...

1646
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:38,790
Like the galbi seasoning?

1647
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:40,619
- Gosh. To be a galbi seasoning... - Is it...

1648
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:41,789
- Is it like marinated galbi? - How should I say it?

1649
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:42,790
Gosh. It's...

1650
00:56:42,791 --> 00:56:45,500
It smells like those skewers.

1651
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:47,599
(He takes another bite because it's good.)

1652
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:49,400
- It's on that side. - The sauce is insane.

1653
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,629
- It's closer to the skewers. - The skewers, right?

1654
00:56:51,630 --> 00:56:53,069
- You're right. - You have to make a wrap.

1655
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:55,509
- Is it a bit sweet? - Yes.

1656
00:56:55,510 --> 00:56:56,510
- Yes. - It's sweet.

1657
00:56:56,511 --> 00:56:58,240
I can see why they've been running for 40 years.

1658
00:56:58,410 --> 00:57:00,080
The sauce is filled with umami.

1659
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:02,349
The sauce is the key.

1660
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:03,780
The sauce has a kick.

1661
00:57:03,980 --> 00:57:05,880
It amplifies all the umami there is,

1662
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:07,950
so it increases my appetite while I'm eating it.

1663
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:09,649
(His eyes are locked in.)

1664
00:57:09,650 --> 00:57:11,590
The two of you are not fans of eating.

1665
00:57:11,820 --> 00:57:14,160
- But they're eating nonstop. - It's so good.

1666
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:15,930
You have to have it.

1667
00:57:17,430 --> 00:57:18,689
(Gulping)

1668
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:21,300
The system makes the meat...

1669
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:24,269
cover in the smoky flavor.

1670
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:25,799
As the grease drops, it creates a bigger flame.

1671
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,370
- Yes. - The flame touches the meat.

1672
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:29,369
What comes to my mind after eating this is,

1673
00:57:29,370 --> 00:57:31,640
"Why isn't this restaurant in every neighborhood?"

1674
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,879
The sauce must be really special.

1675
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,950
Right. They probably didn't teach anyone about the sauce.

1676
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:37,309
It must be hard to make it.

1677
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:38,710
- Gosh. - While introducing it...

1678
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,150
Gosh. Director Cha is finally...

1679
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:42,549
I'll pour you one...

1680
00:57:42,550 --> 00:57:44,650
- because you're grilling it well. - You're pouring me one.

1681
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:46,390
- Sir, I'll do my best for you. - Have a drink.

1682
00:57:47,160 --> 00:57:48,389
- Handsome. - You're good.

1683
00:57:48,390 --> 00:57:49,729
If you have an older colleague like him at work,

1684
00:57:49,730 --> 00:57:50,830
it's really tough.

1685
00:57:51,230 --> 00:57:52,899
- They're nice to the bosses. - I'd quit right away.

1686
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,759
They're super nice to their superiors.

1687
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:55,969
They get promoted quickly.

1688
00:57:55,970 --> 00:57:57,830
- They love their bosses. - Should we give a toast?

1689
00:57:58,130 --> 00:57:59,599
- No, just the two of us. - The bosses love them too.

1690
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:00,600
Don't mind them.

1691
00:58:00,601 --> 00:58:02,140
Okay. I'll be loyal to the company.

1692
00:58:02,270 --> 00:58:04,440
At the back, he'd be the one who badmouths Director Cha the most.

1693
00:58:04,570 --> 00:58:05,580
You know that, right?

1694
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,339
I exist because of the company.

1695
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:08,579
- Okay. - I exist...

1696
00:58:08,580 --> 00:58:09,710
because of you.

1697
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:12,620
You have to watch out for someone like him.

1698
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:16,289
I've never seen you eat so well.

1699
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:17,450
What should we order now?

1700
00:58:18,020 --> 00:58:19,590
- It's really good. - Excuse me.

1701
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:21,990
- Then... - Yes.

1702
00:58:22,690 --> 00:58:24,490
We'll have 2 servings of pork belly and 2 servings of beef rib fingers.

1703
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:25,960
You are eating a lot.

1704
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:27,329
It's real.

1705
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:28,659
- It's really good. - It's really good.

1706
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:29,970
That means it's really good.

1707
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:32,669
- Goodness. - Please enjoy.

1708
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:33,899
(The additional order of the meat is here.)

1709
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:34,900
The beef is also...

1710
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,009
Gosh. These are the beef rib fingers.

1711
00:58:38,010 --> 00:58:39,339
The beef rib fingers are one thing.

1712
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,079
But the pork belly is really...

1713
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:43,680
- in good quality. - I'll grill this first.

1714
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:46,280
- Gosh. This is a good one, indeed. - It's...

1715
00:58:46,450 --> 00:58:47,480
It looks good.

1716
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,150
(Eating)

1717
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:52,589
I have a quiz in mind already.

1718
00:58:52,590 --> 00:58:55,360
(Finally, the opportunity to taste it is here.)

1719
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,330
The seonjiguk and two pieces of meat are at stake.

1720
00:58:58,590 --> 00:58:59,899
- Are you giving us all the soup? - Two pieces of meat?

1721
00:58:59,900 --> 00:59:00,929
- The whole thing? - No.

1722
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:02,030
We can enjoy it here...

1723
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:03,630
- once. - Once.

1724
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:05,939
It's because we're not ready to eat the beef yet.

1725
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:08,570
- We can only have a spoonful? - It's not an important quiz.

1726
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:09,939
It's before the main event.

1727
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:12,439
It's not that much for a person to eat.

1728
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,939
- Just give us the whole thing. - Gosh.

1729
00:59:13,940 --> 00:59:15,979
Exclude Dong Hyun for this one.

1730
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:17,310
- Okay. - Sounds good.

1731
00:59:17,650 --> 00:59:19,519
- I'll exclude Dong Hyun. - I'm calling a timeout.

1732
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:20,549
- Okay. - Sorry.

1733
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:22,519
- I don't want to see him. - I was so hungry,

1734
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:24,219
- so I couldn't think straight. - I just don't want to see him.

1735
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:25,619
My apologies.

1736
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:26,819
- Okay. - Here's the question.

1737
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:28,490
When is the birthday...

1738
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:30,529
of Director Cha's eldest princess?

1739
00:59:30,530 --> 00:59:31,729
(A quiz for a flatterer)

1740
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:33,559
Gosh. Enough with the flattery.

1741
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:34,760
- Come on. - Why?

1742
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:37,900
What's wrong with his princess?

1743
00:59:37,970 --> 00:59:39,600
- Is that flattery? - For goodness' sake.

1744
00:59:39,700 --> 00:59:41,740
- You should watch out for him. - It should be "Up or down."

1745
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:42,940
(Solve the quiz first.)

1746
00:59:42,941 --> 00:59:44,409
It's a birthday, so narrow it down.

1747
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:45,740
- June 20. - Up.

1748
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:47,409
September 20.

1749
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:48,779
- September? - September 20.

1750
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:49,780
- Is it the 20th? - Yes.

1751
00:59:49,781 --> 00:59:50,809
- Up. - September 21.

1752
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:52,110
September 21? Up.

1753
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:53,550
September 22.

1754
00:59:54,250 --> 00:59:55,450
- Up. - I have the answer.

1755
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:57,090
September 24.

1756
00:59:58,350 --> 00:59:59,690
- Up. - September 25.

1757
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:01,359
- Up. - I got it!

1758
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:02,360
(It's slowly getting heated up.)

1759
01:00:02,361 --> 01:00:03,490
Isn't it September 23?

1760
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:06,029
September 26.

1761
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:08,359
(September 26)

1762
01:00:08,360 --> 01:00:09,499
- Up. - September 27.

1763
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:10,569
- Say, "I got it." - I got it.

1764
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:11,869
- I got it. - Yes.

1765
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:13,799
- You have to say that. - I did.

1766
01:00:13,800 --> 01:00:15,500
- Seung Ho. - September 29.

1767
01:00:15,710 --> 01:00:17,439
- I got it. - It's correct.

1768
01:00:17,440 --> 01:00:19,679
(September 29)

1769
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:20,839
- Is it September 29? - It's...

1770
01:00:20,840 --> 01:00:21,840
(Angry)

1771
01:00:21,841 --> 01:00:23,509
Timeout. It's even more vague...

1772
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:25,680
than the acrostic poem.

1773
01:00:26,380 --> 01:00:28,479
Give us a quiz with a clear answer.

1774
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,349
- Have this with the meat. - Okay.

1775
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:31,819
- Come on. What did you say? - Thank you.

1776
01:00:31,820 --> 01:00:33,189
You said we should play a fair game.

1777
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:35,389
- An acrostic poem is so subjective. - We have no choice.

1778
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:36,889
(Dong Hyun was the one who tried to solve it...)

1779
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:38,389
(more passionately than others.)

1780
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:39,899
We can keep saying anything.

1781
01:00:39,900 --> 01:00:41,800
(He can't let it go.)

1782
01:00:41,900 --> 01:00:42,900
(What is it to act like this?)

1783
01:00:42,901 --> 01:00:44,199
He kept saying the answers too.

1784
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,569
Can you give another quiz?

1785
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:47,299
But you solved the quiz too.

1786
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:48,400
Another quiz.

1787
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:50,139
I'll have one piece first.

1788
01:00:50,140 --> 01:00:52,040
Have a piece of meat and the soup.

1789
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:53,709
(He savors the pork belly slowly.)

1790
01:00:53,710 --> 01:00:54,710
Gosh. It must be good.
How is it?

1791
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:57,480
- Is it good? - He looks happier.

1792
01:00:58,050 --> 01:01:00,549
Yi Kyung put it on a plate for a while.

1793
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:02,389
- Yes. - Usually, the pork belly...

1794
01:01:02,390 --> 01:01:03,989
would get stiff in such a case.

1795
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:05,219
But it's so tender.

1796
01:01:05,220 --> 01:01:06,389
- It's still so tender. - It has no problem.

1797
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:08,159
(Thanks to the sauce, it stays moist after a while.)

1798
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:09,530
Gosh. It smells delicious.

1799
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:12,429
I didn't expect a birthday question.

1800
01:01:12,430 --> 01:01:14,800
- It was April 25. - Sir, how did you like it?

1801
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:18,700
- Sir. - I should get out of here.

1802
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:22,510
Gosh. Look at the visuals of the beef rib fingers.

1803
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:24,270
It doesn't even make sense.

1804
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,350
You can just devour it because it's beef.

1805
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:31,479
But it shouldn't be too red.

1806
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:32,749
It looks so good.

1807
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,050
Which one do you think will be better?

1808
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:36,049
The pork belly had such a strong impact.

1809
01:01:36,050 --> 01:01:37,219
- Be honest. - It was so tasty.

1810
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:38,550
The pork belly looks better to me too.

1811
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:39,759
Just now,

1812
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,859
did you see him grabbing the chopsticks?

1813
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:44,490
- I wondered which one I should eat. - Sir.

1814
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:46,300
Thank you.

1815
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:48,930
(Frowning)

1816
01:01:51,570 --> 01:01:54,400
- What? - Look how juicy it is.

1817
01:01:54,970 --> 01:01:57,010
- It smells unbelievably good. - Hey.

1818
01:01:57,140 --> 01:01:59,080
- Gosh. - Hey, it's enough.

1819
01:01:59,380 --> 01:02:00,540
It doesn't matter at all.

1820
01:02:01,810 --> 01:02:03,379
It smells like spicy skewers.

1821
01:02:03,380 --> 01:02:04,850
I can smell the spicy skewers.

1822
01:02:05,350 --> 01:02:07,550
Hey. It's totally different from the marinated galbi.

1823
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:08,849
- Really? - Like Sang Uk said,

1824
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:10,490
it has the taste of the sauce for the skewers.

1825
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:12,559
The sauce for the skewers...

1826
01:02:12,560 --> 01:02:14,060
- can be too sweet sometimes. - Yes.

1827
01:02:14,160 --> 01:02:15,930
Like I said, because of its umami,

1828
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:17,360
I keep craving it.

1829
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:19,530
Which one do you like better?

1830
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,930
It's the same as choosing between doenjang stew and kimchi stew.

1831
01:02:22,430 --> 01:02:24,329
- It's a matter of one's preference. - I see.

1832
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:26,700
(Maybe it's a matter of one's preference.)

1833
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:29,570
Should I add both of them?

1834
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:31,839
- Gosh. It sounds good. - It's a collaboration.

1835
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,679
I've never seen Tae Hyun eating that much.

1836
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,780
It's nice. I love it so much.

1837
01:02:38,150 --> 01:02:39,749
Hey. You have to have this.

1838
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:40,780
It doesn't make sense.

1839
01:02:41,050 --> 01:02:42,950
Because I can smell it...

1840
01:02:43,250 --> 01:02:46,420
and because it smells familiar, I'm more curious about it.

1841
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:48,219
Should we take a quiz, then?

1842
01:02:48,220 --> 01:02:49,289
(Desperate)

1843
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:50,330
Hey, this is...

1844
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,199
- It's... - A quiz?

1845
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:54,660
- You have to try it. - Let's start the quiz.

1846
01:02:54,830 --> 01:02:56,099
You'll get a pass when you get the quiz.

1847
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,729
- And there'll be another quiz. - That person will get a pass too.

1848
01:02:57,730 --> 01:02:59,239
The two will eat this as much as they want.

1849
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,240
- Okay. - Okay. Good.

1850
01:03:00,241 --> 01:03:01,400
- One will starve. - Yes.

1851
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:02,669
- Will it be all right? - He might quit this job.

1852
01:03:02,670 --> 01:03:03,670
- It'll be over for him. - Okay.

1853
01:03:03,671 --> 01:03:05,369
Are you going to be all right? I'm asking you in advance.

1854
01:03:05,370 --> 01:03:07,009
- I'll be fine, of course. - Don't get sulky.

1855
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:08,010
No.

1856
01:03:08,011 --> 01:03:09,150
- Are you good? - Yes.

1857
01:03:09,950 --> 01:03:11,109
We're ready.

1858
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:13,820
(A quiz for the freeloaders)

1859
01:03:14,180 --> 01:03:18,619
After the S Apartment was built in Yeouido in 1971,

1860
01:03:18,620 --> 01:03:21,190
a line of other apartments followed.

1861
01:03:21,420 --> 01:03:23,929
To name an apartment back in the day,

1862
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:28,100
"Blank" was used for its familiarity with the public.

1863
01:03:28,630 --> 01:03:29,970
What goes in the "Blank?"

1864
01:03:30,830 --> 01:03:31,930
Let me answer.

1865
01:03:32,300 --> 01:03:33,439
Gemstone names.

1866
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:34,640
- Gemstone names? - Yes.

1867
01:03:35,370 --> 01:03:36,810
- Incorrect. - Let me answer.

1868
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:38,540
- Seung Ho. - Bird.

1869
01:03:38,710 --> 01:03:40,009
Bird? Incorrect.

1870
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:42,040
- Let me answer. Flower. - Flower?

1871
01:03:42,580 --> 01:03:43,580
Incorrect.

1872
01:03:43,581 --> 01:03:46,019
I saw the apartment names on my way here earlier.

1873
01:03:46,020 --> 01:03:47,349
- I saw the Crystal Apartment. - Yes.

1874
01:03:47,350 --> 01:03:50,519
There's the Crystal Apartment. There's the Milky Way Apartment.

1875
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:51,589
The Milky Way?

1876
01:03:51,590 --> 01:03:52,959
Swan Apartment,

1877
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:55,319
Peacock Apartment, Rose Apartment,

1878
01:03:55,320 --> 01:03:57,490
and Hwarang Apartment are all existing apartments.

1879
01:03:57,730 --> 01:03:59,560
So there are apartments with the things we mentioned.

1880
01:03:59,660 --> 01:04:01,959
Crystal. Yes. I thought the answer was gemstone.

1881
01:04:01,960 --> 01:04:03,169
- Crystal, Milky Way... - Gemstone, bird...

1882
01:04:03,170 --> 01:04:04,330
Sang Uk, what was your answer?

1883
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:05,530
Flower.

1884
01:04:05,770 --> 01:04:08,800
The names came from a product that was popular at the time.

1885
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,139
- A product? - A product?

1886
01:04:10,140 --> 01:04:11,270
Let me answer.

1887
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:13,680
Toilet paper brands.

1888
01:04:13,880 --> 01:04:14,910
Incorrect.

1889
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:16,509
(Hold on.)

1890
01:04:16,510 --> 01:04:17,910
I have an idea.

1891
01:04:20,050 --> 01:04:21,050
Cigarette.

1892
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:24,549
- How are we supposed to get it? - If it's what I think it is,

1893
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:27,219
it's inside this room.

1894
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:28,260
- In this room? - In this room?

1895
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:30,190
I can see it.

1896
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:31,830
- Hurry up. - Let me answer.

1897
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:33,330
Liquor.

1898
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,300
- Incorrect. - It must be similar.

1899
01:04:36,730 --> 01:04:38,330
I see it in my line of sight.

1900
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:40,370
In your line of sight?

1901
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:44,110
(No smoking)

1902
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:45,570
I'm looking at it.

1903
01:04:46,380 --> 01:04:47,910
I'm not looking far into the distance.

1904
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,450
I'm not looking far into the distance.

1905
01:04:51,050 --> 01:04:52,309
- Let me answer. - I'm looking at it now.

1906
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:53,320
Bicycle?

1907
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:56,320
- Incorrect. - I'm looking at it directly.

1908
01:04:56,690 --> 01:04:57,790
What are you looking at?

1909
01:04:57,850 --> 01:04:59,590
I'm looking at it directly.

1910
01:05:00,290 --> 01:05:02,090
I took a photo of my line of sight.

1911
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:03,959
- Please share it. - I see it.

1912
01:05:03,960 --> 01:05:05,189
It's my line of sight.

1913
01:05:05,190 --> 01:05:06,929
- Slowly, - I can't see it from the side.

1914
01:05:06,930 --> 01:05:08,230
I zoomed in.

1915
01:05:08,330 --> 01:05:10,299
- Don't look at it for too long. - I have no idea.

1916
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,830
- Okay. I figured it out. - Trash can?

1917
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,869
- Incorrect. - Let me answer. I figured it out.

1918
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:16,740
- It's so easy. - Cigarette names.

1919
01:05:16,770 --> 01:05:18,069
Cigarette names? Correct.

1920
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:19,640
- Okay. - Correct.

1921
01:05:22,540 --> 01:05:23,949
There's the no smoking sign.

1922
01:05:23,950 --> 01:05:25,079
(Smoking is bad for your health.)

1923
01:05:25,080 --> 01:05:27,049
- I'll grill it right away. - Okay. Thank you.

1924
01:05:27,050 --> 01:05:28,179
You'll know once you eat it.

1925
01:05:28,180 --> 01:05:29,549
It's so delicious.

1926
01:05:29,550 --> 01:05:31,319
- It smells so good. - You know how it tastes.

1927
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:33,259
Hurry up. They must be struggling.

1928
01:05:33,260 --> 01:05:34,260
(Teasing)

1929
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,290
- He licked it a bit. - Did your tongue touch the meat?

1930
01:05:37,360 --> 01:05:39,760
- It touched the meat. - Come on! But I'll still eat it.

1931
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,830
(Laughing)

1932
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,630
It's so tasty.

1933
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,100
I'll keep giving you meat.

1934
01:05:48,140 --> 01:05:49,309
Gosh, this is...

1935
01:05:49,310 --> 01:05:50,640
- Will you make a wrap? - My goodness.

1936
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:53,940
When can we receive a question?

1937
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:56,679
- What? - A question.

1938
01:05:56,680 --> 01:05:57,779
- A question. - Hurry up.

1939
01:05:57,780 --> 01:05:58,949
(The problem solvers of Yeouido are angry.)

1940
01:05:58,950 --> 01:06:00,279
If you want a question, I'll give it now.

1941
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,880
There's not much pork belly left. You need to hurry up.

1942
01:06:02,050 --> 01:06:03,350
At the time it was built,

1943
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:07,659
the National Assembly Building was designed with various meanings.

1944
01:06:07,660 --> 01:06:10,159
Among them, the 365 "Blank..."

1945
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,700
in the main hall of the building contains the meaning...

1946
01:06:12,830 --> 01:06:14,999
that the members of the National Assembly...

1947
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,170
should work hard 365 days a year for the citizens.

1948
01:06:17,670 --> 01:06:18,999
What goes in the "Blank?"

1949
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,270
- Let me answer. - The National Assembly Building?

1950
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:22,069
- Stairs. - Stairs? Incorrect.

1951
01:06:22,070 --> 01:06:23,270
- It was similar. - Let me answer.

1952
01:06:23,410 --> 01:06:24,509
- What is it? - Windows.

1953
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:25,510
Windows? Incorrect.

1954
01:06:25,511 --> 01:06:27,339
- Let me answer. - They urge them to work hard.

1955
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:29,480
- Chairs. - Chairs? Incorrect.

1956
01:06:30,110 --> 01:06:31,309
- I want to eat it with rice. - Go ahead.

1957
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:32,620
- Let me answer. - Sang Uk.

1958
01:06:32,850 --> 01:06:34,949
Lamps. Lights.

1959
01:06:34,950 --> 01:06:37,249
(Lights)

1960
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:38,350
Correct.

1961
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,560
- Lights. - Lights?

1962
01:06:42,590 --> 01:06:44,859
- The lights should be turned on. - Yes.

1963
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:46,560
(365 lights were installed so that they would work hard.)

1964
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:48,359
Seung Ho lost.

1965
01:06:48,360 --> 01:06:49,470
(Sang Uk succeeds in getting food.)

1966
01:06:49,830 --> 01:06:50,830
I'm ruined.

1967
01:06:50,831 --> 01:06:53,440
Seung Ho wanted to eat.

1968
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:56,269
This is exactly what will happen during the fine-dining experience.

1969
01:06:56,270 --> 01:06:57,370
Seriously. I can see it.

1970
01:06:58,170 --> 01:06:59,380
I can see the future.

1971
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:02,139
I really wanted to eat seonjiguk.

1972
01:07:02,140 --> 01:07:03,180
- It's so tasty. - Try it.

1973
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:11,050
Seonji is so soft.

1974
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:12,790
It's tasty, right?

1975
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:15,720
- It's no joke. - I want to eat it with rice.

1976
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:18,290
- It's a proper dish. - It needs two pieces of meat.

1977
01:07:18,630 --> 01:07:20,000
It's like combining the two best dishes.

1978
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,099
(Clapping like a seal)

1979
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:23,300
Did you try the meat?

1980
01:07:24,500 --> 01:07:26,900
As soon as I ate it...

1981
01:07:27,370 --> 01:07:29,809
You know the skewer with chicken and green onion, right?

1982
01:07:29,810 --> 01:07:31,740
- Yes. - It smelled like that sauce.

1983
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,680
- Your expressions have improved. - It really tastes like that sauce.

1984
01:07:36,050 --> 01:07:37,510
- The chicken dish. - That's right.

1985
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:39,950
I really want to eat that tender meat.

1986
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:45,290
That's mine. Give it to me.

1987
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,720
(Laughing)

1988
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:53,200
Look how soft it is.

1989
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,199
(Seung Ho suddenly shoves in his plate.)

1990
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,369
What's this? It can't be done.

1991
01:07:59,370 --> 01:08:01,299
There are rules, so it can't be done.

1992
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,440
I just tried it to see if I'd get a piece or not.

1993
01:08:03,770 --> 01:08:05,040
I just shoved it in.

1994
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:07,580
- It's so tasty. - Of course.

1995
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:10,010
- It's nice. - It's so tender.

1996
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:12,710
(The 3rd attempt)

1997
01:08:14,220 --> 01:08:15,279
I told you so.

1998
01:08:15,280 --> 01:08:16,289
(The 4th attempt)

1999
01:08:16,290 --> 01:08:17,690
You know,

2000
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,689
it's leaner than pork belly.

2001
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:20,790
It's really lean.

2002
01:08:21,020 --> 01:08:22,020
I love the texture.

2003
01:08:22,021 --> 01:08:23,030
(Eat some vegetables.)

2004
01:08:24,690 --> 01:08:27,130
(Dong Hyun teases him again.)

2005
01:08:27,930 --> 01:08:28,999
(The 5th attempt)

2006
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,730
I did it in the most natural way.

2007
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:33,800
I keep getting vegetables.

2008
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:35,399
(He gets a piece of sweet potato.)

2009
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:37,369
- What kind of a vegetable is it? - What is it?

2010
01:08:37,370 --> 01:08:38,440
Isn't it a piece of sweet potato?

2011
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:41,480
Thank you. Gosh, this is a tasty cut.

2012
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:43,679
Pork belly is the best in this restaurant.

2013
01:08:43,680 --> 01:08:44,680
(He gets a wet wipe.)

2014
01:08:44,681 --> 01:08:45,910
Pork belly is the best.

2015
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:47,780
I like this better.

2016
01:08:48,280 --> 01:08:50,789
I'm not saying that you should break the rules to look after me.

2017
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:53,189
- But you could make a mistake... - That's right.

2018
01:08:53,190 --> 01:08:54,919
and suddenly put meat on it.

2019
01:08:54,920 --> 01:08:56,489
- That's right. - You could do that.

2020
01:08:56,490 --> 01:08:57,860
(He gains a plate.)

2021
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,360
I'm getting many things.

2022
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:01,960
Kimchi and beef galbi.

2023
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:03,269
Kimchi and beef galbi.

2024
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:05,230
It's like a magical chest. It keeps coming.

2025
01:09:06,740 --> 01:09:10,040
The marketing team should work a bit harder.

2026
01:09:10,240 --> 01:09:12,669
How should I say it? Let's bring in more profits.

2027
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:15,210
- If you set the goal... - The goal?

2028
01:09:15,640 --> 01:09:16,650
The goal is...

2029
01:09:18,280 --> 01:09:20,320
the first place in the industry.

2030
01:09:21,050 --> 01:09:23,690
- You have quick wits. - Thank you.

2031
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:24,720
The director likes it.

2032
01:09:24,721 --> 01:09:26,260
- You need to do things yourself. - What did you eat?

2033
01:09:27,190 --> 01:09:28,659
What did you eat? You put something in your mouth.

2034
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:31,229
I stole a piece of meat from Intern Kim.

2035
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:32,260
(Confident)

2036
01:09:33,030 --> 01:09:34,560
Hold on. This is unfair.

2037
01:09:35,060 --> 01:09:38,029
- Life is unfair. - What?

2038
01:09:38,030 --> 01:09:40,200
You should hold on to your things.

2039
01:09:40,300 --> 01:09:42,670
- At all times... - How was I supposed to do that?

2040
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:44,669
- I was looking at you. - Still...

2041
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:47,180
- Seriously. - If you give a toast, we'll follow.

2042
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:49,580
- Please check the bill. - Okay.

2043
01:09:50,350 --> 01:09:52,549
The total keeps going up.

2044
01:09:52,550 --> 01:09:54,379
How much is it? It's because we fed them.

2045
01:09:54,380 --> 01:09:56,490
(Total: 94 dollars)

2046
01:09:56,550 --> 01:09:58,849
Until lunch, we were like, "It's okay."

2047
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,359
- Forty, fifty, and hundred dollars. - Yes.

2048
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,519
Now, it's a bit...

2049
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,029
It's close to 100 dollars.

2050
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:05,929
Now, you'll get a quiz about pork belly.

2051
01:10:05,930 --> 01:10:07,429
- Pork belly? - Pork belly.

2052
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:09,459
- Not Yeouido? - For goodness' sake.

2053
01:10:09,460 --> 01:10:10,470
We're getting a quiz now.

2054
01:10:10,870 --> 01:10:12,669
When you eat grilled pork belly,

2055
01:10:12,670 --> 01:10:15,500
- garlic is essential. - Yes.

2056
01:10:15,700 --> 01:10:17,569
According to an informational show,

2057
01:10:17,570 --> 01:10:19,709
garlic contains allicin...

2058
01:10:19,710 --> 01:10:21,480
which gives it a spicy flavor.

2059
01:10:21,640 --> 01:10:24,110
But it contains more sugar than people normally think.

2060
01:10:25,450 --> 01:10:26,450
Now,

2061
01:10:26,780 --> 01:10:31,050
list garlic, Coca-Cola, and onion...

2062
01:10:31,320 --> 01:10:34,219
in the order of high sugar content.

2063
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:35,490
We're using Brix as a measurement.

2064
01:10:35,890 --> 01:10:37,560
- Garlic, Coca-Cola, and onion? - It's so easy.

2065
01:10:37,890 --> 01:10:38,990
Is it easy?

2066
01:10:40,030 --> 01:10:41,130
It's so easy.

2067
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:42,799
Everyone thinks...

2068
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,429
- that Coca-Cola comes first. - Yes.

2069
01:10:44,430 --> 01:10:48,269
We can see what the wrong answer is.

2070
01:10:48,270 --> 01:10:50,509
We can see what the wrong order is.

2071
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:53,039
- What's that order? - Coca-Cola, onion, and garlic.

2072
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,179
That's the most obvious order.

2073
01:10:54,180 --> 01:10:55,779
- Dong Hyun. - Yes?

2074
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:57,610
- We're in different teams. - Okay.

2075
01:10:58,480 --> 01:10:59,620
I got confused for a second.

2076
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,780
Why don't you eat a garlic clove if you're okay with it?

2077
01:11:02,450 --> 01:11:04,349
- That sounds wrong. - See if you taste the sweetness.

2078
01:11:04,350 --> 01:11:06,419
There's no way I'll taste the sweetness.

2079
01:11:06,420 --> 01:11:07,420
Have a small bite.

2080
01:11:08,220 --> 01:11:09,490
How much sweetness do you taste?

2081
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:12,829
This is... You know what?

2082
01:11:12,830 --> 01:11:15,800
- Spiciness... - It's pretty sweet.

2083
01:11:16,060 --> 01:11:17,099
Really?

2084
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:18,269
Is it because I had a small bite?

2085
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:20,969
Tteokbokki contains a lot of sugar,

2086
01:11:20,970 --> 01:11:22,639
but you don't taste the sweetness because it's spicy.

2087
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,069
You don't taste the sweetness in garlic because it's bitter,

2088
01:11:24,070 --> 01:11:25,110
but it's very sweet.

2089
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:27,239
It's sweeter than Coca-Cola.

2090
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:28,410
(Is that so?)

2091
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:30,479
- It's practically sugar. - Not bad.

2092
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:32,249
Still, I think onion is sweeter.

2093
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:33,680
- Same here. - Come on.

2094
01:11:33,850 --> 01:11:35,950
There are people who make dalgona with garlic.

2095
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:37,650
With garlic.

2096
01:11:37,790 --> 01:11:40,320
It's the order of sugar content.

2097
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:42,659
Had onion had more sugar than Coca-Cola,

2098
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:43,689
there would've been an article.

2099
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:45,289
- There was an article. - Zero sugar...

2100
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:46,599
There was an article.

2101
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:48,429
- There was an article. - Coca-Cola, onion, and garlic?

2102
01:11:48,430 --> 01:11:49,829
(He doesn't listen to Dong Hyun.)

2103
01:11:49,830 --> 01:11:50,870
Without a twist?

2104
01:11:51,170 --> 01:11:52,230
It's too obvious.

2105
01:11:53,740 --> 01:11:55,169
Why would they ask such an obvious question?

2106
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:56,439
Think about it.

2107
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,039
Coca-Cola contains 30g of sugar, right?

2108
01:11:58,040 --> 01:12:01,509
The same amount of garlic will contain more sugar.

2109
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:02,739
- Sang Uk. - Don't compare it to one clove.

2110
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:05,280
- Make Dong Hyun shut up. - Imagine a pile of garlic.

2111
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:07,019
- It's practically sugar. - Okay.

2112
01:12:07,020 --> 01:12:08,950
- Why are you solving the question? - Okay.

2113
01:12:09,050 --> 01:12:11,490
We could be confused about the sugar content.

2114
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:14,060
One can of Coca-Cola contains this much sugar.

2115
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:17,089
We check the Brix for fruits.

2116
01:12:17,090 --> 01:12:18,090
(The man who advocated for garlic's sweetness gets quiet.)

2117
01:12:18,091 --> 01:12:20,359
The higher the Brix, the higher the commercial value.

2118
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:21,400
- Yes. - It means that it's sweeter.

2119
01:12:21,630 --> 01:12:23,299
Hello? Okay. We're on our way.

2120
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:25,330
It's the fine-dining restaurant. They want us to hurry.

2121
01:12:26,340 --> 01:12:27,999
They gave me a call.

2122
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,139
- The food will get cold. - Seriously.

2123
01:12:30,140 --> 01:12:31,739
- They cooked in advance. - Yes.

2124
01:12:31,740 --> 01:12:33,880
Shall we go with Coca-Cola, onion, and garlic?

2125
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:35,340
- Okay. - All right.

2126
01:12:35,410 --> 01:12:38,579
Here is the answer. Coca-Cola, onion, and garlic...

2127
01:12:38,580 --> 01:12:40,919
- is the order of sugar content. - Garlic.

2128
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:43,290
Coca-Cola, onion, and garlic.

2129
01:12:44,520 --> 01:12:45,789
The order can't be onion, garlic, and Coca-Cola.

2130
01:12:45,790 --> 01:12:46,790
It can't be correct.

2131
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:49,489
- It can't be correct. - Incorrect.

2132
01:12:49,490 --> 01:12:50,860
- Okay. - Yes.

2133
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,259
Is the order onion, garlic, and Coca-Cola?

2134
01:12:52,260 --> 01:12:54,099
- I actually checked. - Tae Hyun.

2135
01:12:54,100 --> 01:12:55,499
- Did you check? - I was so surprised.

2136
01:12:55,500 --> 01:12:56,500
- What is it? - Is garlic the sweetest?

2137
01:12:56,501 --> 01:12:57,599
- What is it? - I was so surprised.

2138
01:12:57,600 --> 01:12:59,869
- It'll be 1 of the 2. - Yes.

2139
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:01,300
The one who answers first will be exempt.

2140
01:13:01,400 --> 01:13:03,439
- First? - There aren't many options.

2141
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:05,169
Let me answer. Garlic, onion, and Coca-Cola.

2142
01:13:05,170 --> 01:13:07,639
- One try at a time. - Garlic, onion, and Coca-Cola?

2143
01:13:07,640 --> 01:13:09,780
- Backwards. - Then my answer is...

2144
01:13:10,410 --> 01:13:12,450
onion, Coca-Cola, and garlic.

2145
01:13:14,380 --> 01:13:16,049
- Both answers are incorrect. - Let me answer.

2146
01:13:16,050 --> 01:13:18,119
Onion, garlic, and Coca-Cola.

2147
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,819
- Incorrect. - It's my turn.

2148
01:13:19,820 --> 01:13:21,019
- What? - Hold on.

2149
01:13:21,020 --> 01:13:23,289
- You have the answer now. - What was it? Hold on.

2150
01:13:23,290 --> 01:13:26,329
- Five, four, three... - Hold on. Let me think.

2151
01:13:26,330 --> 01:13:28,799
- Let me think. - Wait. What's my next option?

2152
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,299
You might get another chance. You never know.

2153
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:31,599
- Give it a go. - I don't know.

2154
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:33,900
Garlic, Coca-Cola, onion.

2155
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:35,670
Correct.

2156
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:37,109
Does garlic come first?

2157
01:13:37,110 --> 01:13:38,609
- Does garlic come 1st? - Does it come 1st?

2158
01:13:38,610 --> 01:13:40,679
- Garlic comes 1st. - It's 3 times sweeter than melon.

2159
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:41,979
- I read an article. - In terms of the sugar content?

2160
01:13:41,980 --> 01:13:43,149
Yes. It's three times sweeter than melon.

2161
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:44,849
I see. I had no idea.

2162
01:13:44,850 --> 01:13:46,080
Director, thank you for the food.

2163
01:13:46,150 --> 01:13:47,749
Gosh, Yi Kyung.

2164
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:49,580
- I just need to avoid paying next. - That's right.

2165
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:50,750
Let's go and pay.

2166
01:13:50,751 --> 01:13:52,019
(He gets apprehended for payment.)

2167
01:13:52,020 --> 01:13:53,889
- The total is 94 dollars. - Okay.

2168
01:13:53,890 --> 01:13:55,389
(Total: 94 dollars)

2169
01:13:55,390 --> 01:13:57,430
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you.

2170
01:13:57,490 --> 01:13:59,530
I can't believe...

2171
01:13:59,830 --> 01:14:02,600
that garlic comes first. It was impossible to get it right.

2172
01:14:03,130 --> 01:14:04,629
Thank you for the food.

2173
01:14:04,630 --> 01:14:06,369
We'll enjoy ourselves at a fine-dining restaurant too.

2174
01:14:06,370 --> 01:14:07,539
Not bad.

2175
01:14:07,540 --> 01:14:09,499
(Thanks to Director Cha,)

2176
01:14:09,500 --> 01:14:11,510
(they happily set off to the next location.)

2177
01:14:11,710 --> 01:14:14,479
(The next destination)

2178
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,810
Where are we?

2179
01:14:16,610 --> 01:14:18,079
Then this place...

2180
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,420
Where was the old MBC building?

2181
01:14:21,150 --> 01:14:23,050
- The old MBC building? - Sang Uk and I have no idea.

2182
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:26,190
- Was this the old MBC building? - Yes.

2183
01:14:26,220 --> 01:14:28,819
- It's this one. - Yes. It's this one.

2184
01:14:28,820 --> 01:14:29,959
It's this one.

2185
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:31,459
(Destination, the members' current location)

2186
01:14:31,460 --> 01:14:33,559
- This was the MBC building. - Yes.

2187
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,000
(The old MBC building was behind the members.)

2188
01:14:36,260 --> 01:14:38,330
I had no idea that the old MBC building was here.

2189
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:42,000
(They move past the memories of Director Cha.)

2190
01:14:42,140 --> 01:14:45,170
The buildings make me feel like I'm in a different world.

2191
01:14:45,840 --> 01:14:47,479
We came to the most popular place.

2192
01:14:47,480 --> 01:14:49,339
(They head toward the second DMR location.)

2193
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:51,280
It's impossible to enter on the weekend.

2194
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:53,750
You're handsome!

2195
01:14:54,280 --> 01:14:55,750
Me? Thank you.

2196
01:14:56,490 --> 01:14:58,049
Me? Thank you.

2197
01:14:58,050 --> 01:14:59,089
- "Me?" - Dong Hyun...

2198
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:00,619
- gained courage. - She wasn't talking to you.

2199
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:02,059
- "Me?" - Dong Hyun gained courage.

2200
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:03,290
She told me that I was handsome.

2201
01:15:03,460 --> 01:15:04,659
(What's the second location of DMR?)

2202
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,260
There's a 20 percent chance that it's me.

2203
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:08,799
- Hello. - Welcome.

2204
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:09,870
- Hello. - Hello.

2205
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,299
- What? - This is incredible.

2206
01:15:12,300 --> 01:15:13,469
This place is insane.

2207
01:15:13,470 --> 01:15:15,040
(They enter in an astonished state.)

2208
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:19,440
(You go past the elegant reception under the soft light.)

2209
01:15:21,310 --> 01:15:25,910
(The main hall is made up of graceful curves.)

2210
01:15:26,210 --> 01:15:31,049
(There are high-end dishware and objects.)

2211
01:15:31,050 --> 01:15:34,389
It'll be so nice to come here with my parents and loved ones.

2212
01:15:34,390 --> 01:15:35,889
(It's a place you want to visit on a special day...)

2213
01:15:35,890 --> 01:15:37,359
(with a special person.)

2214
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:38,490
(My goodness)

2215
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:41,459
- This is insane. - This is incredible.

2216
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:43,299
- Seriously. - We came to the right place.

2217
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:45,800
- This place is amazing. - What? We can see the Han River.

2218
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:57,710
(In both day and night, the place offers the best view.)

2219
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,179
(We welcome you to a fine-dining restaurant,)

2220
01:16:00,180 --> 01:16:02,080
(the second DMR in Yeouido.)

2221
01:16:02,280 --> 01:16:03,649
Seriously,

2222
01:16:03,650 --> 01:16:05,320
this is the view of success.

2223
01:16:05,420 --> 01:16:08,019
The view alone must be worth 300 dollars.

2224
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:09,259
That must be the flat fee.

2225
01:16:09,260 --> 01:16:11,329
Aren't you glad that you chose a fine dining restaurant?

2226
01:16:11,330 --> 01:16:12,429
Totally.

2227
01:16:12,430 --> 01:16:14,199
- You won't feel bad about paying. - Well,

2228
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,000
it'll be better if I don't pay.

2229
01:16:17,670 --> 01:16:21,739
Have you been to fine-dining restaurants?

2230
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:23,269
I'm not used to fine dining.

2231
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:24,439
(I'm not used to fine dining.)

2232
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:28,710
I rarely go shopping or buy clothes.

2233
01:16:28,910 --> 01:16:30,209
- I don't care about fashion. - It seems that way.

2234
01:16:30,210 --> 01:16:32,579
But... Right? You're right.

2235
01:16:32,580 --> 01:16:34,719
But I love food.

2236
01:16:34,720 --> 01:16:37,120
Eating tasty food in the evening is my happiness.

2237
01:16:37,220 --> 01:16:39,989
- So I visit every 2 to 3 months. - You visit often.

2238
01:16:39,990 --> 01:16:41,089
- That's quite often. - I do it with my wife.

2239
01:16:41,090 --> 01:16:44,189
On our birthdays, anniversaries, or Christmas,

2240
01:16:44,190 --> 01:16:45,789
we visit a fine dining restaurant.

2241
01:16:45,790 --> 01:16:48,100
(The loving husband enjoys fine-dining with his wife.)

2242
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:51,500
This is a place I can't visit easily.

2243
01:16:51,570 --> 01:16:53,940
I feel like I'm getting treated.

2244
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:57,339
This room must be more expensive.

2245
01:16:57,340 --> 01:16:59,840
There must be a requirement for a number of people.

2246
01:17:00,580 --> 01:17:02,610
We were seated here so that we couldn't see the view.

2247
01:17:02,710 --> 01:17:04,149
Seriously.

2248
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:05,479
- You know, - We can't see the view.

2249
01:17:05,480 --> 01:17:07,150
I feel so lucky.

2250
01:17:09,780 --> 01:17:11,490
- Hello. - Hello. It's nice to meet you.

2251
01:17:11,790 --> 01:17:13,150
- My goodness. - Hello. It's nice to meet you.

2252
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,689
I'm the chef in charge at the F Hotel...

2253
01:17:15,690 --> 01:17:17,529
and the head chef of this restaurant.

2254
01:17:17,530 --> 01:17:19,330
My name is Lee Dae Geon. It's nice to meet you.

2255
01:17:19,390 --> 01:17:20,600
He's our chef.

2256
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:23,399
(Chef Lee Dae Geon, Yeouido F Hotel's chef in charge)

2257
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:25,729
(He has 20 years of experience from hotels around the world.)

2258
01:17:25,730 --> 01:17:28,369
M Restaurant uses the seasonal ingredients.

2259
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:31,909
I picked the ingredients that suit spring.

2260
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:34,779
I prepared only the best ingredients.

2261
01:17:34,780 --> 01:17:36,310
(Today's dishes will use springtime ingredients.)

2262
01:17:36,340 --> 01:17:40,320
As you know, carabinero shrimp is very expensive.

2263
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:43,349
You'll get that shrimp, caviar, abalone, asparagus,

2264
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:47,219
and a precious dish of suckling pig.

2265
01:17:47,220 --> 01:17:50,560
I'll cook the dishes with care so that they'll be tasty.

2266
01:17:50,590 --> 01:17:52,959
I hope you make good memories today.

2267
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:54,929
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2268
01:17:54,930 --> 01:17:58,400
(The second DMR in Yeouido starts now.)

2269
01:17:58,730 --> 01:18:00,099
Take photos.

2270
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:02,239
(On a pretty plate...)

2271
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:05,670
(is the first dish of the day.)

2272
01:18:05,970 --> 01:18:08,240
(It's so pretty.)

2273
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:09,909
What's in front of you...

2274
01:18:09,910 --> 01:18:12,449
isn't a part of the course. It's a greeting from the chef.

2275
01:18:12,450 --> 01:18:14,379
(A greeting from the chef that isn't a part of the course)

2276
01:18:14,380 --> 01:18:16,180
If it's like a greeting, can't we get it as well?

2277
01:18:16,550 --> 01:18:18,589
- Shall we prepare it? - If it's like a greeting...

2278
01:18:18,590 --> 01:18:20,160
- It can't be done. - Is that so?

2279
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:21,789
- Okay. - Why not?

2280
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:23,659
- You startled me. - Thanks for the offer, but...

2281
01:18:23,660 --> 01:18:27,759
The chef who is preparing the tasty dishes...

2282
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,259
gives this to express his gratitude.

2283
01:18:29,260 --> 01:18:31,100
You can't eat it alone. Isn't that right?

2284
01:18:31,970 --> 01:18:33,999
People can't drop by, eat this, and leave, right?

2285
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:35,470
- You're right. - Exactly.

2286
01:18:35,940 --> 01:18:37,439
I said hello to the chef.

2287
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:38,610
It can't be done.

2288
01:18:38,870 --> 01:18:40,880
(What's this?)

2289
01:18:41,110 --> 01:18:42,710
Is it shine muscat?

2290
01:18:44,550 --> 01:18:46,409
In front of you...

2291
01:18:46,410 --> 01:18:49,079
is a greeting from the chef called an amuse-bouche.

2292
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,449
(Amuse-bouche is an appetizer that's served before the meal.)

2293
01:18:50,450 --> 01:18:52,349
The topmost one at the 12 o'clock direction...

2294
01:18:52,350 --> 01:18:55,219
uses a seasonal ingredient, flounder.

2295
01:18:55,220 --> 01:18:57,359
- Is this a flounder? - It's a crunchy tart.

2296
01:18:57,360 --> 01:18:59,059
There's an apple sauce inside.

2297
01:18:59,060 --> 01:19:00,060
(Flounder tart with the apple sauce)

2298
01:19:00,061 --> 01:19:02,199
The bottom one at the 9 o'clock direction...

2299
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:04,999
is a fried webfoot octopus.

2300
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,799
It's topped with stringy stonecrop.

2301
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,839
The one at the very bottom has been made with green plum.

2302
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:12,010
It has the shape and texture of marshmallow.

2303
01:19:12,570 --> 01:19:14,840
It'll wrap up the appetizer.

2304
01:19:15,240 --> 01:19:17,379
Is this flounder?

2305
01:19:17,380 --> 01:19:20,520
- I thought it was shine muscat. - Shine muscat.

2306
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:22,950
Gosh, it smells nice.

2307
01:19:22,980 --> 01:19:24,150
It smells like flowers.

2308
01:19:25,050 --> 01:19:29,020
(He takes a bite.)

2309
01:19:29,420 --> 01:19:31,630
(He puts it in his mouth!)

2310
01:19:32,730 --> 01:19:35,630
(Curious)

2311
01:19:36,060 --> 01:19:39,600
(How does the chef's greeting taste?)

2312
01:19:40,540 --> 01:19:43,970
(The taste makes them laugh.)

2313
01:19:44,610 --> 01:19:46,739
- It's thick. - I can't imagine the taste.

2314
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,739
The appetizer is a bit sweet,

2315
01:19:48,740 --> 01:19:50,009
thick,

2316
01:19:50,010 --> 01:19:51,280
and clean-tasting.

2317
01:19:51,550 --> 01:19:53,519
It's a taste I haven't had before.

2318
01:19:53,520 --> 01:19:55,480
I can't compare it to anything.

2319
01:19:56,480 --> 01:19:57,789
Is it soft?

2320
01:19:57,790 --> 01:20:00,090
(How about the second one, the fried webfoot octopus?)

2321
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:03,160
(Chewing)

2322
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:06,559
(Why? How is it?)

2323
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:07,730
It's a fried dish.

2324
01:20:07,960 --> 01:20:09,630
But it has been fried very lightly.

2325
01:20:09,760 --> 01:20:11,469
The webfoot octopus is very soft.

2326
01:20:11,470 --> 01:20:12,829
- That's right. - It's half sashimi.

2327
01:20:12,830 --> 01:20:14,100
- It's tender. - Yes.

2328
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:16,869
It smells like cheese.

2329
01:20:16,870 --> 01:20:19,640
(They wrap up with the sweet marshmallow.)

2330
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:23,510
(The bite-sized pieces stimulate the appetite.)

2331
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:27,450
But this is... Why don't we get the option...

2332
01:20:27,550 --> 01:20:28,820
like the last time?

2333
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:31,119
- What? - When it was our turn,

2334
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:33,659
we let people in your team try the food.

2335
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:35,789
- The food disappears so quickly. - I know.

2336
01:20:35,790 --> 01:20:38,060
- It's ridiculous. - There's no way.

2337
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:40,699
(However, food keeps coming when you have a course meal.)

2338
01:20:40,700 --> 01:20:41,830
What's this?

2339
01:20:42,000 --> 01:20:43,770
This is incredible.

2340
01:20:44,030 --> 01:20:46,869
The first dish is the caviar.

2341
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:48,040
Caviar.

2342
01:20:50,070 --> 01:20:51,169
This is incredible.

2343
01:20:51,170 --> 01:20:52,509
(The first dish contains the restaurant's pride.)

2344
01:20:52,510 --> 01:20:53,780
There's gold.

2345
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:57,149
The top layer is the crystal caviar.

2346
01:20:57,150 --> 01:21:00,179
We use a caviar brand of the highest quality.

2347
01:21:00,180 --> 01:21:02,979
Under the caviar is the high-end shrimp from Spain...

2348
01:21:02,980 --> 01:21:05,949
called the carabinero shrimp.

2349
01:21:05,950 --> 01:21:08,360
- We scoop it up like this. - It's one each.

2350
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:10,659
- Like this. - There's something inside.

2351
01:21:10,660 --> 01:21:11,860
Look at this.

2352
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:14,800
It looks like this.

2353
01:21:15,100 --> 01:21:16,230
- Did you see it? - Yes.

2354
01:21:16,700 --> 01:21:18,200
- I want to show it to you. - It's fascinating.

2355
01:21:19,130 --> 01:21:20,370
To whom are you showing it?

2356
01:21:21,770 --> 01:21:23,370
To whom are you showing it?

2357
01:21:24,840 --> 01:21:26,070
It's so tasty.

2358
01:21:26,110 --> 01:21:28,410
When you held it up to show it to the camera,

2359
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:30,279
the two of them flinched.

2360
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:31,679
To whom are you showing it?

2361
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:33,079
(Is he teasing us?)

2362
01:21:33,080 --> 01:21:34,280
To whom are you showing it?

2363
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:35,879
For goodness' sake.

2364
01:21:35,880 --> 01:21:38,590
(I'm sorry.)

2365
01:21:39,320 --> 01:21:44,360
(How does the caviar dish taste?)

2366
01:21:45,660 --> 01:21:48,400
This shrimp smells so good.

2367
01:21:48,760 --> 01:21:53,130
It's like eating something straight from the sea.

2368
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,439
And there's something like almond.

2369
01:21:56,440 --> 01:21:58,740
He talked about macadamia.

2370
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:01,110
I wish I could give you a bite.

2371
01:22:02,380 --> 01:22:05,449
I'll give you a bite.

2372
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:07,479
- It's new. - Just like that?

2373
01:22:07,480 --> 01:22:09,080
- A question... - Can we eat it?

2374
01:22:09,450 --> 01:22:11,819
Aren't you curious about my birthday?

2375
01:22:11,820 --> 01:22:12,849
- I know. - Curious, my foot.

2376
01:22:12,850 --> 01:22:14,060
September 30.

2377
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,290
- Is it correct? - Yes.

2378
01:22:16,790 --> 01:22:18,389
I'll give you a bite. It's new.

2379
01:22:18,390 --> 01:22:20,259
(Yi Kyung is quick-witted.)

2380
01:22:20,260 --> 01:22:21,660
It's the most luxurious dish.

2381
01:22:22,100 --> 01:22:24,400
(Happy)

2382
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,199
(Is this how it's going to be?)

2383
01:22:26,200 --> 01:22:27,670
How does it taste?

2384
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:29,800
It's...

2385
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:32,810
the scent of the sea people like the most.

2386
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:34,980
Tae Hyun.

2387
01:22:36,910 --> 01:22:38,150
Have a big spoonful.

2388
01:22:39,750 --> 01:22:41,920
I like macadamia.

2389
01:22:43,320 --> 01:22:45,689
I gave it to Tae Hyun for a spoonful,

2390
01:22:45,690 --> 01:22:47,760
but he's destroying it.

2391
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:48,920
(He's destroying the caviar dish.)

2392
01:22:48,921 --> 01:22:50,330
I found it.

2393
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:52,089
I want to have...

2394
01:22:52,090 --> 01:22:54,360
- a bite with macadamia. - It's tasty.

2395
01:22:54,460 --> 01:22:55,660
That's the key point.

2396
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:00,600
Give it back now.

2397
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:03,740
He mixed it...

2398
01:23:04,240 --> 01:23:06,240
so that I could eat it easily.

2399
01:23:06,810 --> 01:23:08,380
He mixed it.

2400
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,179
(A special gourmet experience at a fine-dining restaurant)

2401
01:23:10,180 --> 01:23:12,550
So this is how caviar tastes.

2402
01:23:13,050 --> 01:23:14,279
Here's another one.

2403
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:15,679
(This is just the beginning.)

2404
01:23:15,680 --> 01:23:17,750
- The plate is so pretty. - Is that a plate?

2405
01:23:18,690 --> 01:23:21,819
The second dish is the beef tartare.

2406
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:24,289
It has been prepared with the avocado cream and egg yolk...

2407
01:23:24,290 --> 01:23:26,760
which has been turned into a jelly.

2408
01:23:27,460 --> 01:23:28,729
The pretty plate underneath...

2409
01:23:28,730 --> 01:23:30,769
represents the season of cherry blossoms that is to come...

2410
01:23:30,770 --> 01:23:33,570
and was prepared for you to enjoy in advance in Yeouido.

2411
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:35,169
It was prepared for us to enjoy...

2412
01:23:35,170 --> 01:23:36,670
the season of cherry blossoms that is to come in Yeouido.

2413
01:23:37,210 --> 01:23:38,710
The explanation was incredible.

2414
01:23:40,240 --> 01:23:42,209
This is really...

2415
01:23:42,210 --> 01:23:43,440
(It's time to taste Yeouido's spring.)

2416
01:23:45,150 --> 01:23:46,380
(Taking a bite)

2417
01:23:48,950 --> 01:23:50,389
(Putting into his mouth)

2418
01:23:50,390 --> 01:23:51,420
What is this?

2419
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:53,760
(Satisfied)

2420
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,090
Seriously though...

2421
01:23:56,020 --> 01:23:57,159
As soon as it went into my mouth,

2422
01:23:57,160 --> 01:23:58,660
I thought, "How was it seasoned like this?"

2423
01:23:58,930 --> 01:24:00,090
It's an amazing combination.

2424
01:24:00,330 --> 01:24:03,060
It's a beef tartare and to make it go well with the cracker,

2425
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:05,000
a bit of pepper was added.

2426
01:24:05,400 --> 01:24:07,200
The scent of the cracker could be felt at the end.

2427
01:24:07,970 --> 01:24:10,610
It didn't feel strongly seasoned.

2428
01:24:10,770 --> 01:24:11,840
It felt clean.

2429
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:15,280
This must really feel therapeutic.

2430
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:20,579
The next dish is an abalone and asparagus dish.

2431
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:21,750
(Asparagus royale with fresh abalone and Parmesan espuma)

2432
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:24,149
A bit of wild chive oil is sprinkled.

2433
01:24:24,150 --> 01:24:25,619
- That sounds great. - That is a vegetable...

2434
01:24:25,620 --> 01:24:26,749
that represents spring.

2435
01:24:26,750 --> 01:24:28,589
You are spot on. That is why we serve this.

2436
01:24:28,590 --> 01:24:29,720
I can smell it right away.

2437
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:32,989
(Perfect for his taste)

2438
01:24:32,990 --> 01:24:34,230
- Gosh. - It's pretty.

2439
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:36,359
If you wish to have more texture,

2440
01:24:36,360 --> 01:24:37,669
you can have it with the pistachio...

2441
01:24:37,670 --> 01:24:38,729
- placed underneath. - Pistachio?

2442
01:24:38,730 --> 01:24:39,870
(Pistachio for more texture)

2443
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:47,040
(A big mouthful of abalone with the taste of spring)

2444
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:53,880
It's a soup, but it tastes a bit like mushroom.

2445
01:24:54,150 --> 01:24:55,520
- It's really good. - The flying fish roe.

2446
01:24:55,780 --> 01:24:57,520
The big flying fish roe gives a good texture too.

2447
01:24:57,950 --> 01:24:59,050
It's really good.

2448
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:02,690
This is crunchy like shrimp.

2449
01:25:03,490 --> 01:25:05,189
Does it not have the bitter taste of asparagus?

2450
01:25:05,190 --> 01:25:06,790
No. I love this.

2451
01:25:07,700 --> 01:25:10,830
(Dong Hyun has cleared his plate in a flash.)

2452
01:25:16,600 --> 01:25:18,140
(Is there something left?)

2453
01:25:18,340 --> 01:25:19,610
This is really good.

2454
01:25:20,410 --> 01:25:21,639
(What is that?)

2455
01:25:21,640 --> 01:25:22,709
- What? - Is it new?

2456
01:25:22,710 --> 01:25:23,710
This is really good.

2457
01:25:24,050 --> 01:25:25,150
Try it.

2458
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:28,049
(Eating...)

2459
01:25:28,050 --> 01:25:30,050
(and eating again)

2460
01:25:30,650 --> 01:25:31,690
Right.

2461
01:25:31,990 --> 01:25:34,320
(Chewing)

2462
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:38,430
You ate all of the pistachio?

2463
01:25:38,830 --> 01:25:40,129
It's really good.

2464
01:25:40,130 --> 01:25:42,130
(Empty)

2465
01:25:42,530 --> 01:25:43,629
It's delicious.

2466
01:25:43,630 --> 01:25:44,729
(Seung Ho takes a bite too.)

2467
01:25:44,730 --> 01:25:46,770
- It's a lot of work to peel them. - Right.

2468
01:25:46,830 --> 01:25:48,870
Pigeons would go crazy for this.

2469
01:25:49,240 --> 01:25:50,399
This could be taken out...

2470
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:52,509
and fed from our pockets.

2471
01:25:52,510 --> 01:25:53,609
Like this.

2472
01:25:53,610 --> 01:25:55,479
- Fine-dining pistachio. - It's really good.

2473
01:25:55,480 --> 01:25:57,380
- Was the pistachio this good? - It's really good.

2474
01:25:57,850 --> 01:25:59,709
It's okay. I'm done.

2475
01:25:59,710 --> 01:26:00,949
- More pistachio. - I won't have it!

2476
01:26:00,950 --> 01:26:03,150
- Gosh. - How can I eat all of this?

2477
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:05,650
Since we're in Yeouido...

2478
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:11,360
- When we leave, - How may I help you?

2479
01:26:11,630 --> 01:26:13,900
could you pack Dong Hyun some pistachio?

2480
01:26:14,630 --> 01:26:17,530
(He's really enjoying it.)

2481
01:26:17,730 --> 01:26:20,369
To be honest, after serving the dish here,

2482
01:26:20,370 --> 01:26:22,439
I've never seen anyone finish all of it.

2483
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:25,239
We collected all of it for him.

2484
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:26,309
Really?

2485
01:26:26,310 --> 01:26:27,710
That was three bowls put together.

2486
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:28,940
Really?

2487
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:30,340
You finished all of it,

2488
01:26:30,750 --> 01:26:33,179
so I thought you found it to be really good.

2489
01:26:33,180 --> 01:26:35,480
- The chef must feel so proud. - Right.

2490
01:26:35,780 --> 01:26:37,389
He will smile ear to ear.

2491
01:26:37,390 --> 01:26:39,049
- He ate all of the pistachio. - He ate all of the pistachio.

2492
01:26:39,050 --> 01:26:41,019
- He ate everything except the bowl. - This is really hard to make.

2493
01:26:41,020 --> 01:26:42,160
- Right? - Yes.

2494
01:26:42,720 --> 01:26:43,890
I'll be honest.

2495
01:26:44,830 --> 01:26:48,030
Rather than it being a dish cooked,

2496
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:49,660
it feels like a work of art.

2497
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,130
Right.

2498
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,599
I think chefs have an amazing imagination.

2499
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:55,870
This dish was created.

2500
01:26:56,800 --> 01:26:58,810
(With the best ingredients,)

2501
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,009
(the best cuisine experience...)

2502
01:27:04,010 --> 01:27:07,220
(is provided through fine-dining.)

2503
01:27:08,950 --> 01:27:10,990
(The plate is the drawing paper...)

2504
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:18,330
(and the ingredients become a story.)

2505
01:27:18,830 --> 01:27:20,459
The roasted suckling pig...

2506
01:27:20,460 --> 01:27:22,259
has been prepared to be crispy on the outside...

2507
01:27:22,260 --> 01:27:23,329
and light on the inside.

2508
01:27:23,330 --> 01:27:25,130
To add a bit of sourness, the kumquat...

2509
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:27,370
and the kumquat sauce will be served as well.

2510
01:27:28,670 --> 01:27:29,670
(Taking a bite)

2511
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:33,239
(An amazing texture that unfolds in the mouth)

2512
01:27:33,240 --> 01:27:34,310
- Gosh! - Gosh!

2513
01:27:35,340 --> 01:27:38,810
The skin feels crispy, but it's so juicy inside.

2514
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,749
- The sauce is amazing. - It's crispy.

2515
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:44,049
When it starts to feel greasy, the refreshing flavor hits you.

2516
01:27:44,050 --> 01:27:45,220
That must be the last one.

2517
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:47,889
It must be a sherbet.

2518
01:27:47,890 --> 01:27:48,919
You are precise.

2519
01:27:48,920 --> 01:27:50,760
This is like a sherbet that will freshen up your mouth.

2520
01:27:51,230 --> 01:27:52,829
It looks like a sherbet,

2521
01:27:52,830 --> 01:27:55,400
but it's called the granita that started in Sicily.

2522
01:27:59,670 --> 01:28:01,399
(Freshening up the mouth with a refreshing sherbet...)

2523
01:28:01,400 --> 01:28:03,139
(in the middle of the course)

2524
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:04,670
Gosh.

2525
01:28:04,770 --> 01:28:05,940
It just freshens you up.

2526
01:28:06,770 --> 01:28:09,079
It has the refreshing taste you get from chewing gum.

2527
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:10,510
- Yes. As soon as you put it in. - It's sweet too.

2528
01:28:11,050 --> 01:28:14,180
Here is the branzino, the European seabass.

2529
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:18,019
It is served with the tea tree mushroom and puree.

2530
01:28:18,020 --> 01:28:20,319
Please enjoy it with the sea urchin roe sauce.

2531
01:28:20,320 --> 01:28:21,389
(Grilled branzino, duck egg, artichoke, tea tree mushroom,)

2532
01:28:21,390 --> 01:28:22,460
(sea urchin roe sauce)

2533
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:25,460
Isn't this truffle?

2534
01:28:25,860 --> 01:28:27,260
No. It isn't that.

2535
01:28:27,460 --> 01:28:29,430
It's the dried fig.

2536
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:31,169
- It's the tea tree mushroom. - I'm sorry.

2537
01:28:31,170 --> 01:28:33,230
- Tea tree mushroom? - He gets everything wrong.

2538
01:28:33,330 --> 01:28:35,400
This isn't a mushroom, is it?

2539
01:28:35,870 --> 01:28:36,899
You were very close.

2540
01:28:36,900 --> 01:28:38,939
It's a crumble made with duck eggs.

2541
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,540
He's responding to everything we say.

2542
01:28:40,840 --> 01:28:43,279
He never says we're wrong.

2543
01:28:43,280 --> 01:28:45,349
- Well... - He's always so positive.

2544
01:28:45,350 --> 01:28:46,809
(The positive man of this area)

2545
01:28:46,810 --> 01:28:49,049
There must be a rule where you can't say no.

2546
01:28:49,050 --> 01:28:51,290
It's not like that, but we try our best...

2547
01:28:51,820 --> 01:28:54,420
not to make our customers feel embarrassed.

2548
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:56,320
- I see. - We try our best not to do that.

2549
01:28:56,520 --> 01:28:58,689
- They should never feel that way. - Right.

2550
01:28:58,690 --> 01:28:59,729
Thank you so much.

2551
01:28:59,730 --> 01:29:01,529
It's better for us to feel embarrassed,

2552
01:29:01,530 --> 01:29:02,930
so we'll do our best.

2553
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:06,930
(Shall we carry on with the sixth dish of the course?)

2554
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:08,770
(Taking a bite of the plump seabass meat)

2555
01:29:08,771 --> 01:29:10,739
- Right. - The main dish.

2556
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:11,769
So this is...

2557
01:29:11,770 --> 01:29:13,269
- Gosh. - It wasn't fully cooked.

2558
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:14,380
That is why it tastes even better.

2559
01:29:14,510 --> 01:29:15,780
- It tastes better that way? - It just melts.

2560
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:17,609
(The seabass meat just melts in your mouth.)

2561
01:29:17,610 --> 01:29:18,610
- It really just melts. - It's so good.

2562
01:29:18,611 --> 01:29:19,649
- I see. - Right.

2563
01:29:19,650 --> 01:29:21,780
The outside is crispy, but the inside...

2564
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:24,489
takes in the fork right away.

2565
01:29:24,490 --> 01:29:27,119
(Grilled delicately for it to be crispy and soft at the same time)

2566
01:29:27,120 --> 01:29:28,260
Gosh.

2567
01:29:31,630 --> 01:29:32,689
(Touched)

2568
01:29:32,690 --> 01:29:34,330
Gosh.

2569
01:29:34,630 --> 01:29:36,029
The skin tastes so good.

2570
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:37,900
This skin is amazing.

2571
01:29:39,570 --> 01:29:41,740
This must be because Sang Uk has been abroad often.

2572
01:29:41,870 --> 01:29:44,910
He feels different with his table manners.

2573
01:29:45,070 --> 01:29:46,410
Why? What's different?

2574
01:29:46,870 --> 01:29:49,539
(His knife is placed to face the top?)

2575
01:29:49,540 --> 01:29:51,409
Was there a reason you placed it like this?

2576
01:29:51,410 --> 01:29:53,780
It was because it wouldn't stand on one side.

2577
01:29:54,050 --> 01:29:55,350
I always place it like this,

2578
01:29:55,550 --> 01:29:56,980
but it kept facing the top.

2579
01:29:58,020 --> 01:29:59,149
- That was why it was like that? - Yes.

2580
01:29:59,150 --> 01:30:00,189
I see.

2581
01:30:00,190 --> 01:30:02,690
This happened to me before.

2582
01:30:03,060 --> 01:30:05,290
I placed the fork and knife here to talk.

2583
01:30:05,390 --> 01:30:08,159
But this means you're done eating in another country.

2584
01:30:08,160 --> 01:30:09,659
That was why my plate was taken away.

2585
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:11,329
- I see. - It had to be placed like this...

2586
01:30:11,330 --> 01:30:12,829
for it not to be taken away.

2587
01:30:12,830 --> 01:30:14,470
(It means you are still eating if your fork and knife are on.)

2588
01:30:14,940 --> 01:30:16,499
Night has come...

2589
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:18,940
and the night view has started to appear.

2590
01:30:19,370 --> 01:30:20,909
(Seen from the 29th floor)

2591
01:30:20,910 --> 01:30:22,010
The lights are coming on.

2592
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:28,980
(The flashy lights in the night view of Seoul)

2593
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:33,720
(It's time for the main dish.)

2594
01:30:34,420 --> 01:30:36,019
This is the tenderloin steak.

2595
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:37,729
Spring greens were used...

2596
01:30:37,730 --> 01:30:39,589
and made into a pie.

2597
01:30:39,590 --> 01:30:40,859
(Charcoal-grilled Korean tenderloin and spring green tart)

2598
01:30:40,860 --> 01:30:43,129
To provide more of a savory taste,

2599
01:30:43,130 --> 01:30:46,169
the deodeok sauce will be added.

2600
01:30:46,170 --> 01:30:48,099
(Deodeok sauce full of the scent of spring)

2601
01:30:48,100 --> 01:30:50,200
Gosh, it smells sweet.

2602
01:30:54,210 --> 01:30:55,540
- It's pretty. - Is this rare?

2603
01:30:55,780 --> 01:30:57,809
It has been cooked very rare for the two of you.

2604
01:30:57,810 --> 01:30:59,179
- Very rare? - Yes.

2605
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:01,619
- It has the same color. - If you slice it,

2606
01:31:01,620 --> 01:31:03,119
- you'll be able to tell. - It doesn't look rare...

2607
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:04,220
from the outside at all.

2608
01:31:04,820 --> 01:31:07,250
What? Right.

2609
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:08,989
This is the tenderloin steak.

2610
01:31:08,990 --> 01:31:11,490
(Stretching)

2611
01:31:11,790 --> 01:31:13,690
(Stretching)

2612
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:15,759
Isn't there something wrong with this?

2613
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,160
- The size. - Oh, right.

2614
01:31:17,770 --> 01:31:19,330
Did someone have some of it on the way here?

2615
01:31:19,970 --> 01:31:21,469
Did something happen to it?

2616
01:31:21,470 --> 01:31:22,470
Hold on.

2617
01:31:22,471 --> 01:31:23,800
This is a bit...

2618
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:25,640
Is this a kid's dish?

2619
01:31:26,270 --> 01:31:27,510
A kid's dish.

2620
01:31:28,110 --> 01:31:29,610
You can surely feel that way about it.

2621
01:31:30,140 --> 01:31:32,279
(He responded to that too?)

2622
01:31:32,280 --> 01:31:33,549
He even responded to that?

2623
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:35,449
"You can surely feel that way about it."

2624
01:31:35,450 --> 01:31:38,850
(You can surely feel that way about it.)

2625
01:31:39,690 --> 01:31:41,390
- It's very rare. - How does it look?

2626
01:31:41,620 --> 01:31:44,019
- How does yours look? - I'll cut it.

2627
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:46,459
(Squishy)

2628
01:31:46,460 --> 01:31:47,529
It's like this.

2629
01:31:47,530 --> 01:31:50,699
(The rare meat shows its red side.)

2630
01:31:50,700 --> 01:31:52,599
- Gosh. - Was that the color you wanted?

2631
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:53,770
That must be cold.

2632
01:31:54,370 --> 01:31:55,939
It was the color I wanted.

2633
01:31:55,940 --> 01:31:57,169
- It looks cold. - It looks cold.

2634
01:31:57,170 --> 01:31:58,509
(It's perfect for me.)

2635
01:31:58,510 --> 01:31:59,909
Gosh.

2636
01:31:59,910 --> 01:32:02,410
(Adding the sauce and green pesto)

2637
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:04,010
(Eating it in one bite!)

2638
01:32:06,810 --> 01:32:08,150
(Mouth watering)

2639
01:32:08,950 --> 01:32:11,390
(He's just amazed.)

2640
01:32:11,950 --> 01:32:13,620
- It's very rare. - It's very rare.

2641
01:32:14,220 --> 01:32:16,560
It tastes amazing.

2642
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:19,189
- Right. - Is it that good?

2643
01:32:19,190 --> 01:32:21,360
(The small and precious medium well-done steak for Dong Hyun)

2644
01:32:22,330 --> 01:32:24,030
(He takes a bite.)

2645
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:26,799
(He takes another bite.)

2646
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:27,970
It feels different.

2647
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:30,500
That's what I think.

2648
01:32:31,410 --> 01:32:32,440
(Amazed)

2649
01:32:33,210 --> 01:32:34,940
What? Gosh.

2650
01:32:35,110 --> 01:32:36,480
Where did it go?

2651
01:32:37,510 --> 01:32:38,649
Did they not serve you?

2652
01:32:38,650 --> 01:32:40,309
Did someone steal it from me?

2653
01:32:40,310 --> 01:32:42,320
His plate is empty all of a sudden.

2654
01:32:43,420 --> 01:32:45,620
(The meat is too small for the athlete.)

2655
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:49,420
(This isn't the end yet.)

2656
01:32:50,060 --> 01:32:53,589
The first dessert is the creme brulee.

2657
01:32:53,590 --> 01:32:54,630
(Earl grey creme brulee)

2658
01:32:55,230 --> 01:32:57,230
It's like the milk pudding.

2659
01:32:57,900 --> 01:32:59,930
- Milk pudding? - Black sugar?

2660
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:02,540
- Right. - It tastes like black sugar.

2661
01:33:03,900 --> 01:33:05,239
We tried that.

2662
01:33:05,240 --> 01:33:07,509
(Another surprising dessert gets served.)

2663
01:33:07,510 --> 01:33:09,080
This is something that makes you feel happy.

2664
01:33:09,710 --> 01:33:11,509
This is an amazing type of ice cream.

2665
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:13,110
(Served like a work of art)

2666
01:33:13,410 --> 01:33:14,519
- Really? - It's ice cream.

2667
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:15,950
- What is it? - Ice cream.

2668
01:33:16,120 --> 01:33:17,420
- Gelato? - Vanilla?

2669
01:33:17,590 --> 01:33:18,749
That was very close.

2670
01:33:18,750 --> 01:33:19,789
(It's not wrong. It was very close.)

2671
01:33:19,790 --> 01:33:22,020
- Sir, you're very kind. - Really?

2672
01:33:22,060 --> 01:33:23,660
Was my guess close? Is it like vanilla?

2673
01:33:23,760 --> 01:33:26,090
Isn't it a boiled egg?

2674
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,230
I also get them confused.

2675
01:33:29,530 --> 01:33:31,569
(I also get them confused.)

2676
01:33:31,570 --> 01:33:32,770
Seriously?

2677
01:33:32,900 --> 01:33:35,170
- Thank you. - He's impressive.

2678
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:37,969
In front of you, it's what's called the Ispahan.

2679
01:33:37,970 --> 01:33:40,209
It's flavored with raspberries and lychee.

2680
01:33:40,210 --> 01:33:41,980
It's a type of chocolate.

2681
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,249
On the right is Mascarpone ice cream. Thank you.

2682
01:33:45,250 --> 01:33:46,550
(It's Mascarpone ice cream, not a boiled egg.)

2683
01:33:47,820 --> 01:33:49,020
When you push it, it goes in.

2684
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:51,919
(A raspberry mousse cake that's as soft as sponge)

2685
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:52,949
It's bread.

2686
01:33:52,950 --> 01:33:54,860
(A raspberry mousse cake that's as soft as sponge)

2687
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:57,519
It looks so cute.

2688
01:33:57,520 --> 01:34:00,030
(It's in charge of wrapping up today's course meal.)

2689
01:34:02,260 --> 01:34:04,500
(Exclaiming)

2690
01:34:04,930 --> 01:34:07,399
- It's similar to milk ice cream. - It's very good.

2691
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,499
(The most wonderful sweetness ever)

2692
01:34:08,500 --> 01:34:10,870
- It's clear. - Isn't it tasty?

2693
01:34:12,940 --> 01:34:14,639
- This is amazing. - This is great.

2694
01:34:14,640 --> 01:34:17,810
(They finish the meal.)

2695
01:34:18,550 --> 01:34:21,920
- Once we get the bill... - Now, I'm feeling the pressure.

2696
01:34:21,950 --> 01:34:23,219
I'm feeling the pressure.

2697
01:34:23,220 --> 01:34:24,220
(Pressured)

2698
01:34:24,221 --> 01:34:25,990
- You didn't know while eating? - No.

2699
01:34:26,550 --> 01:34:27,889
This is really...

2700
01:34:27,890 --> 01:34:28,890
(The other team also feels pressured.)

2701
01:34:28,891 --> 01:34:31,290
If they get the quiz right...

2702
01:34:31,830 --> 01:34:34,960
(Then the bill arrives.)

2703
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,530
Here's your bill.

2704
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:38,869
- How much is it? - Well, it's...

2705
01:34:38,870 --> 01:34:41,069
(How much is the fine-dining?)

2706
01:34:41,070 --> 01:34:43,970
How much is it approximately?

2707
01:34:44,200 --> 01:34:46,370
It's 774 dollars.

2708
01:34:46,870 --> 01:34:48,079
Let me take a look.

2709
01:34:48,080 --> 01:34:50,180
(250 per person, a total of 774 dollars)

2710
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:52,980
(It's more than I thought.)

2711
01:34:53,310 --> 01:34:54,449
All right.

2712
01:34:54,450 --> 01:34:55,479
(Thrill to its max)

2713
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:56,920
Dong Hyun, we just need to answer the quiz.

2714
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,550
Exactly.

2715
01:34:58,650 --> 01:34:59,819
Okay.

2716
01:34:59,820 --> 01:35:01,759
(Who'll Pay? Time for Quiz)

2717
01:35:01,760 --> 01:35:02,990
Here's the question.

2718
01:35:03,290 --> 01:35:07,390
The end of a table knife is blunt.

2719
01:35:07,590 --> 01:35:09,329
After experiencing this...

2720
01:35:09,330 --> 01:35:13,500
during a meal with a guest, a cardinal in France ordered...

2721
01:35:13,970 --> 01:35:15,869
the sharp end...

2722
01:35:15,870 --> 01:35:18,240
of the table knife to be blunt.

2723
01:35:18,640 --> 01:35:19,840
What had happened?

2724
01:35:21,410 --> 01:35:23,380
- This is... - Didn't he drop the knife?

2725
01:35:23,580 --> 01:35:25,079
He dropped the knife,

2726
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:27,610
so his foot got stabbed.

2727
01:35:27,780 --> 01:35:29,080
It could be something like that.

2728
01:35:29,180 --> 01:35:31,520
While cutting something, he dropped the knife.

2729
01:35:32,150 --> 01:35:33,150
His foot got stabbed.

2730
01:35:33,151 --> 01:35:35,090
Did you know that the fencing sword is blunt at the end?

2731
01:35:35,190 --> 01:35:36,389
- I didn't know. - I knew that.

2732
01:35:36,390 --> 01:35:38,259
The end is round.

2733
01:35:38,260 --> 01:35:40,290
- It's a little... - It's to prevent you...

2734
01:35:40,830 --> 01:35:42,000
from getting stabbed.

2735
01:35:42,030 --> 01:35:43,960
Since he knows about swords...

2736
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:45,670
Aren't you an expert in knives?

2737
01:35:45,870 --> 01:35:48,870
- I think that's the closest guess. - I've dropped it a lot.

2738
01:35:49,000 --> 01:35:50,439
How about this idea?

2739
01:35:50,440 --> 01:35:52,810
He had a guest over, and the end of the knife was broken.

2740
01:35:52,940 --> 01:35:55,439
He couldn't allow a broken knife...

2741
01:35:55,440 --> 01:35:57,409
to be served to his guests.

2742
01:35:57,410 --> 01:35:59,949
If it's round, it'd be easier to wash.

2743
01:35:59,950 --> 01:36:02,079
Maybe that's why he suggested it.

2744
01:36:02,080 --> 01:36:03,879
You don't like it? Then forget about it.

2745
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:06,249
(He gives up quickly when it isn't well received.)

2746
01:36:06,250 --> 01:36:08,020
I have ten more ideas.

2747
01:36:08,720 --> 01:36:11,189
The cook gave them forks and knives,

2748
01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:12,290
and his hands were cut.

2749
01:36:12,430 --> 01:36:13,629
(Laughing)

2750
01:36:13,630 --> 01:36:14,999
- "What happened to you?" - Because he was bleeding?

2751
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,359
"What happened to you?"

2752
01:36:16,360 --> 01:36:19,969
"I was washing them, but the knives were sharp."

2753
01:36:19,970 --> 01:36:21,170
"I got cut."

2754
01:36:21,270 --> 01:36:22,800
While washing the dishes.

2755
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:25,369
Since he was a cardinal,

2756
01:36:25,370 --> 01:36:27,470
he wanted to protect the hands of his cooks.

2757
01:36:27,710 --> 01:36:29,140
Doesn't it sound reasonable?

2758
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:31,309
Listen. Here's something we must remember.

2759
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:33,810
It's something that took place during their meal.

2760
01:36:34,780 --> 01:36:37,020
- Right. - Forget about anything before.

2761
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:38,290
You're right.

2762
01:36:38,790 --> 01:36:40,590
- I knew it. - He brought him back to his senses.

2763
01:36:40,790 --> 01:36:41,790
(He went a little too far.)

2764
01:36:41,791 --> 01:36:43,889
- The answer is in the question. - He was going far,

2765
01:36:43,890 --> 01:36:45,189
- The answer is in the question. - but Seung Ho caught him.

2766
01:36:45,190 --> 01:36:46,389
He grabbed him by the collar.

2767
01:36:46,390 --> 01:36:48,129
He pulled him back to his senses.

2768
01:36:48,130 --> 01:36:50,359
- The first one is right. - I boldly crossed this out.

2769
01:36:50,360 --> 01:36:51,669
- This can't be it. - This one...

2770
01:36:51,670 --> 01:36:53,630
An accident took place because he dropped the knife.

2771
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,400
We'll go with this.

2772
01:36:55,600 --> 01:36:56,700
It's because...

2773
01:36:58,370 --> 01:37:00,240
of a dangerous situation...

2774
01:37:01,710 --> 01:37:03,280
caused by the drop of a knife.

2775
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:06,010
- Is that why? - Is that your big picture?

2776
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:09,180
Because of an accident...

2777
01:37:09,450 --> 01:37:11,020
caused by the drop of a knife?

2778
01:37:11,920 --> 01:37:14,759
(What does the future hold for them?)

2779
01:37:14,760 --> 01:37:15,789
(Because of a dangerous situation caused by the drop of a knife)

2780
01:37:15,790 --> 01:37:16,820
Incorrect.

2781
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:18,430
I told you.

2782
01:37:18,790 --> 01:37:19,930
It's incorrect.

2783
01:37:19,990 --> 01:37:21,959
See? That was...

2784
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:23,830
It's only right that we got it wrong.

2785
01:37:23,930 --> 01:37:26,629
- Among the three of you... - Okay.

2786
01:37:26,630 --> 01:37:28,570
- What do we do? - It was a good guess.

2787
01:37:28,640 --> 01:37:30,540
- Are you two safe? - Yes.

2788
01:37:31,040 --> 01:37:32,469
- Tae Hyun. - Congratulations.

2789
01:37:32,470 --> 01:37:33,509
(We're safe.)

2790
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:34,679
- We're safe. - Okay.

2791
01:37:34,680 --> 01:37:35,839
What's the answer?

2792
01:37:35,840 --> 01:37:36,840
- It's too expensive. - Here it is.

2793
01:37:36,841 --> 01:37:38,480
- What is it? - He was shocked...

2794
01:37:38,610 --> 01:37:41,010
to see his guest picking his teeth with the knife.

2795
01:37:41,720 --> 01:37:44,120
- It was impossible to guess. - It was impossible.

2796
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:46,390
After seeing his guest do this?

2797
01:37:46,850 --> 01:37:49,760
- That was impossible to guess. - Right.

2798
01:37:50,290 --> 01:37:51,890
Now, it's an individual game.

2799
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:53,929
Here's the first additional quiz...

2800
01:37:53,930 --> 01:37:56,400
- to determine who will pay. - That sounds fun.

2801
01:37:56,530 --> 01:37:58,569
In the 70s and 80s,

2802
01:37:58,570 --> 01:38:00,370
group blind dates were popular.

2803
01:38:00,700 --> 01:38:02,569
Depending on where the dates took place,

2804
01:38:02,570 --> 01:38:05,040
a date at a dance club was called dance club date.

2805
01:38:05,210 --> 01:38:08,110
A date at a pear field was called pear date.

2806
01:38:08,910 --> 01:38:13,279
Then where did land date take place?

2807
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,780
- "Land date?" - "Land date?"

2808
01:38:15,020 --> 01:38:16,379
This is very difficult.

2809
01:38:16,380 --> 01:38:17,380
(What is land date?)

2810
01:38:17,381 --> 01:38:19,749
- I have no idea at all. - During the 70s and 80s...

2811
01:38:19,750 --> 01:38:22,920
It has to be hard because the price at stake is high.

2812
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:25,460
Land date during the 70s and 80s?

2813
01:38:25,630 --> 01:38:27,960
- I know. - Player Kim Dong Hyun?

2814
01:38:28,130 --> 01:38:29,430
Pear date on a pear field.

2815
01:38:29,660 --> 01:38:31,400
Land date on a peanut field?

2816
01:38:33,270 --> 01:38:35,039
- A peanut field? - It was during the 70s,

2817
01:38:35,040 --> 01:38:36,940
so there are many fields. Peanut field.

2818
01:38:37,970 --> 01:38:39,140
Incorrect.

2819
01:38:40,470 --> 01:38:43,140
- A date in the earth? - A date in the earth?

2820
01:38:43,940 --> 01:38:44,950
That's incorrect.

2821
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:48,850
Land date.

2822
01:38:49,150 --> 01:38:51,490
Here's a hint. It's related to a means of transportation.

2823
01:38:52,350 --> 01:38:53,590
A means of transportation? I know.

2824
01:38:54,050 --> 01:38:56,259
The word comes from the sound.

2825
01:38:56,260 --> 01:38:58,189
Ttang, ttang, ttang.

2826
01:38:58,190 --> 01:39:00,429
A date behind a cultivator.

2827
01:39:00,430 --> 01:39:01,860
(Laughing)

2828
01:39:02,630 --> 01:39:03,799
- Incorrect. - There were many cultivators...

2829
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:04,929
in the 80s.

2830
01:39:04,930 --> 01:39:06,070
That was a brave approach.

2831
01:39:06,370 --> 01:39:07,370
Incorrect.

2832
01:39:09,370 --> 01:39:11,840
- Motorcycle. - Motorcycle? Incorrect.

2833
01:39:12,040 --> 01:39:13,510
- Rickshaw? - Incorrect.

2834
01:39:14,240 --> 01:39:15,639
- Bus. - Incorrect.

2835
01:39:15,640 --> 01:39:17,380
- Boat. - Incorrect.

2836
01:39:17,440 --> 01:39:18,909
- Train. - Train? Incorrect.

2837
01:39:18,910 --> 01:39:19,980
There's nothing else.

2838
01:39:20,250 --> 01:39:22,280
- What else is there? - That's all I can come up with.

2839
01:39:22,680 --> 01:39:24,849
Say all types of transportation.

2840
01:39:24,850 --> 01:39:26,949
- I know. - There has to be more.

2841
01:39:26,950 --> 01:39:28,889
- Airplane? - Incorrect.

2842
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:31,929
- I know. Subway. - Correct.

2843
01:39:31,930 --> 01:39:33,029
(That's right.)

2844
01:39:33,030 --> 01:39:34,260
How so?

2845
01:39:34,590 --> 01:39:37,159
Nice. Was there a subway back then?

2846
01:39:37,160 --> 01:39:39,229
- That's right. - There was subway in the 80s.

2847
01:39:39,230 --> 01:39:41,599
- Of course. - It was a cool space.

2848
01:39:41,600 --> 01:39:43,940
Young people must have thought that it was a fancy place.

2849
01:39:44,340 --> 01:39:45,439
This is wonderful.

2850
01:39:45,440 --> 01:39:46,739
(Sang Uk escaped.)

2851
01:39:46,740 --> 01:39:49,810
(Only two people remain.)

2852
01:39:49,910 --> 01:39:52,150
Won't it be better to split the bill?

2853
01:39:52,250 --> 01:39:53,479
- What? - Split the bill?

2854
01:39:53,480 --> 01:39:54,680
Or do you want to get to the end?

2855
01:39:55,420 --> 01:39:56,980
Just buy me a meal now.

2856
01:39:57,220 --> 01:39:58,220
It's too late.

2857
01:39:58,350 --> 01:39:59,719
(Laughing)

2858
01:39:59,720 --> 01:40:02,420
If you had asked me that when we got here, I'd happily pay,

2859
01:40:02,490 --> 01:40:04,160
but this isn't treating you.

2860
01:40:04,290 --> 01:40:06,329
It feels like paying because I lost.

2861
01:40:06,330 --> 01:40:07,890
- It's because... - Losing can become a habit.

2862
01:40:08,660 --> 01:40:09,829
- Okay. - You should do it.

2863
01:40:09,830 --> 01:40:12,929
With 774 dollars at stake, let's go.

2864
01:40:12,930 --> 01:40:14,700
- I'm in. - Here's the question.

2865
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:17,869
M Guide gives stars to restaurants...

2866
01:40:17,870 --> 01:40:19,170
all over the world.

2867
01:40:19,940 --> 01:40:21,579
It started from guide books...

2868
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:23,309
published by a French tire company...

2869
01:40:23,310 --> 01:40:25,380
in order to increase their sales.

2870
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:29,719
This guide rates restaurants...

2871
01:40:29,720 --> 01:40:32,350
by giving stars.

2872
01:40:32,620 --> 01:40:36,189
A one-star rating means that the restaurant is...

2873
01:40:36,190 --> 01:40:37,790
worth a stop when visiting that region.

2874
01:40:38,530 --> 01:40:42,599
A three-star rating means that it's worth picking the region...

2875
01:40:42,600 --> 01:40:46,229
as your destination in order to try the restaurant.

2876
01:40:46,230 --> 01:40:49,070
Then what does a two-star rating mean?

2877
01:40:49,670 --> 01:40:51,710
- I know. - Okay, he's got it.

2878
01:40:52,940 --> 01:40:54,640
It means, "I'll come back if I visit this region again."

2879
01:40:55,910 --> 01:40:57,380
- Incorrect. - I know.

2880
01:40:57,910 --> 01:40:59,250
"It's worth waiting in line."

2881
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:00,949
Incorrect.

2882
01:41:00,950 --> 01:41:03,480
"It's okay to starve from the morning to eat here."

2883
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:04,850
Incorrect.

2884
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:06,790
"This restaurant comes up on GPS."

2885
01:41:07,220 --> 01:41:08,220
Incorrect.

2886
01:41:08,320 --> 01:41:09,759
"In order to eat here..."

2887
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,059
(Giving all kinds of ideas)

2888
01:41:11,060 --> 01:41:12,430
"It's okay to pay the parking fee."

2889
01:41:12,730 --> 01:41:14,759
- It's okay to pay the parking fee. - That's good.

2890
01:41:14,760 --> 01:41:15,760
That's a good condition.

2891
01:41:15,761 --> 01:41:17,960
In this context, the region doesn't refer...

2892
01:41:18,300 --> 01:41:19,830
to a small area.

2893
01:41:19,870 --> 01:41:22,639
- It could be Korea or Japan. - A country?

2894
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:25,440
- In the US, it'd be a state. - I know.

2895
01:41:25,710 --> 01:41:27,740
"I'd visit here again for this restaurant."

2896
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,480
Incorrect. It has nothing to do with visiting again.

2897
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:31,779
I know.

2898
01:41:31,780 --> 01:41:33,280
Let's say that they came to travel in Korea.

2899
01:41:33,410 --> 01:41:35,779
- Seriously... - They came to travel in Korea.

2900
01:41:35,780 --> 01:41:37,080
They went to see Gyeongbokgung Palace,

2901
01:41:37,150 --> 01:41:40,650
but a restaurant with two stars is in Busan.

2902
01:41:41,050 --> 01:41:43,260
They'd go to Busan for this restaurant.

2903
01:41:43,760 --> 01:41:44,859
(What does that mean?)

2904
01:41:44,860 --> 01:41:46,260
That's a little...

2905
01:41:47,760 --> 01:41:48,829
Correct.

2906
01:41:48,830 --> 01:41:52,199
(Kim Dong Hyun is correct.)

2907
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:53,730
I give you credit for it.

2908
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:57,699
(It's worth a detour to visit the restaurant.)

2909
01:41:57,700 --> 01:41:59,809
Seung Ho is the one to pay.

2910
01:41:59,810 --> 01:42:01,010
(Shin Seung Ho is the one to pay 774 dollars.)

2911
01:42:01,610 --> 01:42:04,609
Dong Hyun always survives at the end.

2912
01:42:04,610 --> 01:42:05,780
I came from behind.

2913
01:42:06,180 --> 01:42:08,180
- He reminds me of someone. - It was...

2914
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:09,520
similar to that.

2915
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:12,389
I can treat you anytime.

2916
01:42:12,390 --> 01:42:13,690
I just hate losing.

2917
01:42:15,460 --> 01:42:17,659
- I don't like losing. - Today's ending was amazing.

2918
01:42:17,660 --> 01:42:20,030
- I have to win. - Won't it be part of history?

2919
01:42:20,930 --> 01:42:23,360
- Seung Ho, I enjoyed watching you. - Thank you for the food.

2920
01:42:23,560 --> 01:42:24,870
Seung Ho treated us.

2921
01:42:26,270 --> 01:42:28,099
Seung Ho, you're generous.

2922
01:42:28,100 --> 01:42:29,200
(They enjoyed fine dining thanks to generous Seung Ho.)

2923
01:42:30,040 --> 01:42:31,469
(Dinner recommendations in Yeouido)

2924
01:42:31,470 --> 01:42:32,909
(Tae Hyun: Fine-dining once a year can be a good experience.)

2925
01:42:32,910 --> 01:42:34,009
(Dong Hyun: Fine-dining with people you love will be memorable.)

2926
01:42:34,010 --> 01:42:35,309
(Sang Uk: Fine-dining can be healing in repetitive everyday life.)

2927
01:42:35,310 --> 01:42:36,609
(Yi Kyung: Pork belly is the best comfort food for Koreans.)

2928
01:42:36,610 --> 01:42:38,010
(Seung Ho: Meat lovers can eat pork belly without hesitation.)

2929
01:42:38,045 --> 01:42:39,614
(Next neighborhood)

2930
01:42:39,615 --> 01:42:41,044
(Hip and sentimental alleys)

2931
01:42:41,045 --> 01:42:42,785
(Eulji-ro)

2932
01:42:43,315 --> 01:42:45,784
(As Yi Kyung will be missing,)

2933
01:42:45,785 --> 01:42:48,554
(a great guest appears!)

2934
01:42:48,555 --> 01:42:51,794
(The large gourmet, Lee Dae Ho)

2935
01:42:51,795 --> 01:42:55,164
(He says he's not a big eater...)

2936
01:42:55,165 --> 01:42:56,695
(and is a gourmet.)

2937
01:42:56,995 --> 01:42:59,034
(Eulji-ro is filled with great old restaurants.)

2938
01:42:59,035 --> 01:43:02,574
(Which place is your favorite?)

2939
01:43:02,575 --> 01:43:06,775
(Dae Ho will give it a try first.)

2940
01:43:06,805 --> 01:43:09,345
You do eat a lot. What do you mean you don't eat a lot?

2941
01:43:09,545 --> 01:43:13,785
(Shall we start eating in earnest?)

2942
01:43:13,845 --> 01:43:15,215
(Amazed)

2943
01:43:15,385 --> 01:43:17,254
(It's so good.)

2944
01:43:17,255 --> 01:43:19,054
(Let's do our jobs! We should answer the questions!)

2945
01:43:19,055 --> 01:43:21,254
(The freeloader quiz is intense even in Eulji-ro.)

2946
01:43:21,255 --> 01:43:25,564
(You'll just be watching if you don't get it right.)

2947
01:43:25,565 --> 01:43:30,535
(Things will be wild.)

2948
01:43:30,735 --> 01:43:33,164
(You'll be so annoyed if you don't get to eat, won't you?)

2949
01:43:33,165 --> 01:43:34,334
(I feel bad as I'm the only one to be eating.)

2950
01:43:34,335 --> 01:43:36,175
(You'll be so annoyed if you don't get to eat, won't you?)

2951
01:43:36,275 --> 01:43:39,912
(The tasty quarrels will continue next week.)
